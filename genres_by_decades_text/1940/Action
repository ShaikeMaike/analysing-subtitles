Papa!
Papa!
What now, Hildy?
Look!
Gee whiz. Again.
What´s the matter, Gus?
Cigarette.
Ken riding her?
He was, but not now.
Hildy.
Whoa, whoa.
Doggone that kid.
Look at this.
I hope he´s all right.
Young´uns fall light.
He´s used to it.
He could get hurt.
Saddle Shorty.
I better go see.
Ja, Boss.
Never mind, Gus.
Ken.
Yes, sir?
Come here.
You all right?
Sure, I´m all right.
Cigarette toss you again?
Yes, sir.
You ""digged"" your heels in her.
I didn´t.
Did you, Son?
Yes, sir.
Ken, aren´t you ever going to grow up?
I´ve told you not to clap your heels into her.
Look at that bridle.
Second one you´ve broken this week.
I´m sorry, Dad.
Oh, you found the saddle blanket.
What saddle blanket?
I lost it yesterday afternoon.
You forgot to cinch the saddle properly.
Yes, sir.
Gee whiz, it´s all ""tored.""
Will you keep quiet?
It got caught on some barbed wire.
You´re the doggonest kid... for losing, busting, and forgetting.
Breakfast is all ready.
Where´s Ken?
He´s coming.
Cigarette tossed him again.
I don´t know what
I´ll do with that boy.
Doesn´t pay any attention to what I say.
Always losing equipment or breaking it somehow.
He´s still a child.
He´s old enough to have his wits about him.
He´s walking around with his head in the clouds.
It´s a wonder he doesn´t trip.
Morning, Mom.
Come on, darling.
Eat your oatmeal while it´s hot.
Good heavens.
What is it?
Ken´s report card.
I suppose you´re not surprised you haven´t been promoted.
No, sir.
Here, look at your marks.
Let him eat his breakfast first.
Just as a matter of curiosity... how do you go about getting a zero on an examination?
40 in history, 1 7 in arithmetic, but a zero?
Just as one man to another, what goes on in your head?
What have you got to say for yourself?
Nothing, sir.
What were the questions you missed... in that English exam?
We were to write a composition.
Couldn´t you think of anything?
I was going to write... about how you lost your polo mare... how the albino stole her from Banner.
Well, why didn´t you?
I got to thinking.
I thought we had time.
I thought the hour had just begun... when the school bell rang.
You never even got started.
Not a single word, Ken?
No.
Just daydreaming, huh?
No, I was thinking about--
About what?
About my colt.
You haven´t got a colt.
Dad, give me a colt, won´t you?
You´ll get one when you learn how to treat one.
You´ll have to buck up.
Trouble is, you don´t try.
I do try, Dad.
I´d like to see some proof.
Meantime, you´ll study an hour a day... to make up your work.
[Knock On Door]
Come in.
Good morning,
Missus.
Good morning, Gus.
What´s today, Boss?
Good day to move the horses.
It´s time they were off the meadows.
A storm´s cooking up.
Can I help?
Four older horses have to be in shape for the rodeo... and those three-year-olds have to be broke.
Can´t I help move them?
Great guns, no.
It´s tough enough to move 1 00 horses... all fresh as blazes after a winter out... without a kid along to make them nervous.
- I´ll be right out.
- Ja, Boss.
Want another cup of coffee, dear?
No, I had enough.
Got to get started.
Kenny, you can ride any horse on the ranch.
Why are you so set on having a colt?
It isn´t just riding.
I want a colt to be friends with me.
I want a colt of my own, all my own.
You better start your studying.
Get it over with.
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.
Ken, what are you doing?
I´m doing my arithmetic, Mom.
[Alarm Rings]
Where are we going?
To watch Dad bring in the horses.
We can take the shortcut.
No, you better stay here.
It´s tough enough bringing in 1 00 horses... all fresh after a winter out... without having a girl tagging along making them nervous.
Those horses ain´t scared of me.
Good morning.
Nice work, Banner.
Banner don´t let those mares get away with nothing.
Banner´s got everything it takes to make a great horse-- brains, heart, and courage.
If he´d just pass it on to all the colts.
What horses we´d have then.
Whoa now!
Whoa now!
Whoa there!
Look out, Gus.
They´re stampeding!
Gus, try to head them off.
Stop them, Banner!
They´re making straight for the rock slide.
Head them off, Banner.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
What are you doing here?
I--I came to see the horses.
I didn´t mean to do it.
I didn´t mean to scare them.
[Whinny]
Jeepers, if I could ever have a colt like that.
Are we on the downgrade?
I never had so many bills and less money to pay them.
We can´t sell our horses at a profit.
They´re good horses with good blood.
Mm-hmm, all but that albino strain.
They got a crazy streak in them.
No use trying to sell them.
I wouldn´t even get back the cost of raising them.
I´d rather shoot them.
I would, too, if they weren´t so doggone fast.
I hoped to get one decent colt out of that bunch.
Rob... give Ken a colt.
Huh?
I want you to give Ken a colt.
After that stunt he pulled this morning?
You know he didn´t mean to.
He doesn´t deserve a colt.
Won´t you ever give him one?
Sure. I´ve been expecting to.
If he pays attention to his studies--
Uh-uh.
No.
That´s another thing.
That isn´t going to get anzwhere.
Didn´t he study today?
He exposed himself to his books.
Good heavens. Nothing I say to him makes any impression.
He wants his own colt.
He can´t think of another thing.
But that´s all backwards.
You don´t bribe children to do their duty.
It´s not a bribe.
What would you call it?
I just have a feeling...
Ken isn´t going to pull anything off.
It´s time he did.
Maybe a little thing like this... would turn the trick.
That isn´t a little thing.
It isn´t easy to break and school a colt.
I won´t have a good horse spoiled by his carelessness.
Rob, it´s important.
He´s got to succeed at something.
What he needs is--
Is to snap out of it.
If you want to put it that way.
He needs to grow up.
How would having his own colt help?
Oh, you know.
Something of his own... responsibility.
He´d have something real that he cared about... more than those things he goes mooning about.
Don´t go.
I´d like to give Ken a colt.
I´d like to get closer to the boy somehow... but every time I get set for a get-together session... he hands me a facer like what he pulled today.
Rob, didn´t you ever want anything... more than anything else in the world?
Yes. You.
You do understand.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Humming]
Where´s Ken?
Probably looking at the ducks on the landing.
For Pete´s sake, what ducks on what landing?
That old print of mine.
He likes to look at them.
Gus says Rocket broke away last night.
Thinks she´s got a colt somewhere.
We´ll have to look for her.
I´ll find her.
Good. I´ll go with you.
Son, I´m taking back yesterday´s order.
You can forget that hour of study.
Thanks, Dad.
And, Ken...
I´m going to give you a colt.
A colt?
A colt of my own?
Mm-hmm.
I´ll give it to you a week from today.
That´ll give you time to make your own choice.
I can have any colt on the ranch?
- Ayearling?
- That´s right.
Gosh.
Jeepers, maybe I can have the one I saw yesterday.
Come on, you old jughead.
Come on there.
Oh, come on. Come on.
Oh, step on my foot, would you?
Come on.
Why don´t you take Highboy for your colt?
That chump?
Don´t think I´m riding Cigarette because I want to.
It´s because
I have to.
Then how about Lassie?
She´s as fast as anything and black as ink.
Who said I wanted a black horse?
How about College Boy?
He´s smart like a fox.
I´m going to pick a filly.
I know the one
I want, too.
I hope I find her.
Hey, don´t do that again, Hildy.
Cigarette´s kind of nervous.
She might kick you.
She better don´t.
I´ll kick her back.
Thanks, Tim.
OK.
Ready, Ken?
Yes, sir.
Don´t see why
I can´t go, too.
You´re a girl.
That´s why.
Check your cinch?
Yes, sir.
Let´s go.
Ken, don´t you want your hat?
Oh, thanks, Mom.
Don´t see why
I can´t be a boy.
Even you´re a boy...
I guess.
Maybe you think it´s funny, giving you a colt... when you deserve a good hiding.
Flunking all your exams... then pulling that stunt yesterday.
Don´t think
I´m letting you off.
I´m not.
I haven´t gone soft.
Don´t get that into your head.
I expect as much now as I ever did.
This isn´t any reward... because you haven´t won any reward.
This is a partnership.
One of these days,
I´ll need your help.
You have to be trained so you can give it.
Every man needs training.
Discipline.
I got mine at West Point.
And how.
You´re going to train that colt.
I´ll help you with the first breaking... but you´ll train it, and it´ll train you.
Yes, sir.
You and your mother may have to care for this ranch... without me pretty soon.
Where will you be?
I may have to go back into the army.
You understand, don´t you?
Yes, sir.
You make a good pony out of that colt... and let it make a man out of you.
Yes, sir.
I rode all through here yesterday.
I didn´t leave any colts behind.
If Rocket had a colt, she wouldn´t leave it.
I saw a colt yesterday... that got separated from the bunch in the stampede-- a sorrel filly with a cream mane and tail.
Sounds like
Rocket´s yearling.
Rocket´s?
The filly sired by Banner last spring.
That´s what was wrong with Rocket-- she missed that little filly.
She´d very likely console herself with a yearling.
Should pick up a track around here someplace.
Hey, Boss!
A cat.
That´s a mountain lion, all right.
Ja. A big one.
Haven´t had one around here for a long time.
Good thing we got the brood mares out of here.
Maybe we better look around that cave.
Well, it got one of them.
It´s dark brown.
It´s Rocket´s, I guess.
Tim was right.
She had one.
Didn´t she know it was dead?
Yes and no.
Mares are funny about death.
They´ll leave a dead foal... then remember it and hunt for it.
Will the mountain lion get any other horses?
Not now, Kenny.
They´re all out on the range.
Can´t he get the horse and colts there?
Not where there´s no cover.
Their only chance is surprise.
If a horse is off by itself... a lion will jump on it, bite through the spine.
Quick kill.
[Whinny]
It´s Rocket.
And her filly.
What a pretty little flicka she is.
Flicka<
What does that mean?
Swedish for ::little girl.´´
Flicka. That´s what I´ll call her.
My colt.
Your colt?
Yes, sir.
That´s the one I want.
Rocket´s filly, Ken?
Yes, sir.
I hoped you´d make a wiser choice.
You know how I feel... about Rocket´s line of horses.
But she´s fast.
Rocket´s fast, too.
They´re my worst horses.
There´s not one among them with any real sense.
The mares are hellions, the stallions outlaws.
They´re untamable.
I´ll tame her.
Nobody´s ever been able to tame a one of them.
You want a horse that´ll be a friend?
Yes, sir.
You´ll never make a friend of her.
Look what they did to get back together.
No fence in the world will ever hold them.
You better change your mind.
No.
OK, Ken. I promised you could make your own choice.
But remember--
Rocket´s loco... and 1 0-to-1 the colt is, too.
But she may not be.
Banner´s her father.
All right.
We´ll bring her in tomorrow or the next day.
It´s silly to write horses´ names on things.
Horses can´t read.
People can read.
But Pop can´t.
Besides, you ain´t even got a horse yet.
What do you mean
I haven´t got a horse?
Well, it ain´t here.
Dad´s bringing her in today.
[Honk Honk]
[Honk Honk Honk]
That´s Mr. Sergent.
He´s got lots of race horses.
He´s got a fat belly, too.
Hey, Gus, is Rob around?
Ja.
He´s in the house.
Hi, Rob.
Hi, Charley.
How you been doing?
Good. You?
Swell.
Glad to see you.
Sit down.
Rob, I´m shipping a carload of horses to Los Angeles.
Maybe you´d like to go in on the deal... and share the shipping expenses.
Might do that.
There´s room in the car for four more horses.
Sounds pretty good.
You know, Pop says
Flicka´s loco... like her mother.
Don´t say that, Hildy.
Well, ain´t her fault.
She can´t help it if her mom´s crazy, can she?
Banner´s got sense.
She could be like her father, couldn´t she?
I don´t know.
When I do something dumb...
Mom says I take after the old man... and when I do something smart...
Pop says I sure don´t take after the old lady.
You haven´t got anything like Rocket.
That she-devil can outrun... any animal you´ve ever seen.
You´re crazy.
Like to make a bet?
Hello, Charley.
Well, hello there, Nell.
No. Don´t get up.
I only have a minute.
What are you two talking about?
Rocket.
If I could get a mare to do #5 miles an hour--
She´ll make you a fortune... if you could break her.
My broncobuster can break any horse.
He can do it if she´s worth breaking.
Worth it?
Didn´t I tell you?
How much do you want?
Dollars.
You got a stopwatch?
No. I got a speedometer.
Good enough.
Let´s go.
I´ll get lunch ready for you.
[Honking]
There they are.
Isn´t Flicka beautiful?
[Honk Honk]
She´s heading for the north range.
We´ll clock her there.
The ground´s flat.
[Honk Honk]
She´s like a locomotive.
Does she always run with her nose up?
Yeah. She´s a stargazer.
[Honk Honk]
[Honk Honk]
Look at the speedometer.
Faster, Boss.
She ain´t half trying.
[Honk Honk]
If she does #5,
I´ll buy her.
Jumping jeepers!
Well, what do you say?
It´s a deal... if she´s delivered sound in wind and limb.
Just how you´ll do that is anybody´s guess.
You leave that to me.
Look out for Rocket.
Get in there, get in there!
Tim, throw a rope on her.
[Whinny]
Won´t be easy to get her in.
Stay with her, Tim.
Come on!
Get that noose off her neck.
Be careful, Rob.
Think I´d deliver her with string hanging on her?
I put it on.
I´m going to get it off.
Look out!
Open that chute gate so she can see through.
Get in there.
Shut the gate.
Get the truck.
Whoa. That´s it.
Sergent expects her in good shape.
Try not to skin her up.
Get her out of here.
Well, that´s that.
You mean that´s $500.
It´ll come in mighty handy, won´t it?
Dad, look!
Oh, Rob.
That finished her.
Well?
She´s dead.
Poor old Rocket.
It´s too bad, but these things will happen.
Just takes little lick to kill horse.
There´s one thing
I can still do.
Hello, Williams?
This is McLaughlin.
OK. Thanks.
Look, Williams, I got a load of horses for you.
Yeah, those albinos.
Yep. Every one of them,
Rocket´s whole tribe.
There should be some good horseflesh among them.
All right, your own price.
Good.
Yep.
There are nine of them.
Wait a minute.
There may be 1 0.
Ken, come here.
Here´s a chance to do a sensible thing.
I want you to choose another colt... and let me sell Flicka to Mr. Williams.
I´m asking for your sake as well as mine.
What´s the use having another Rocket?
You saw what happened.
I´m going to tame Flicka.
That´s impossible.
Sometimes bad horses get tamed.
You don´t want a loco horse, do you?
I want Flicka.
Look at me.
Dad, please.
She´s mine.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Williams.
I thought there was one more.
No. There are only nine.
Right.
I´ll send them over.
So long.
Haw!
Haw!
Git!
Well, that´s that.
Sure is a wild one.
We´ll let her think it over.
She´ll go right through that wire.
She´ll never go over.
It turned her.
Dad, she has got sense.
Flicka!
I knew it, that crazy--
Rob, hurry!
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There now.
Don´t think she´ll pull out of it.
Maybe it´s just as well.
Hadn´t been this way, it would´ve been another.
A loco horse isn´t worth the bullet... it takes to shoot it.
Now easy, girl.
Flicka.
Eat your dinner,
Kenny.
Do I have to, Mom?
You heard what your mother said.
Flicka, she´s--
Let him go to her.
He can´t do her any good.
Gus and Tim dressed her cuts.
She snaps out of it, she´s got water and oats.
Oh, Flicka, I didn´t mean to hurt you.
Get well.
Please be all right.
Gee, she was pretty.
What do you mean ::was´´?
She is.
She´s beautiful.
I meant when she was running back there.
Say, Ken.
Tomorrow, if you want to take care of her...
I´ll do your work for you.
Would you, Hildy?
Gee, that´d be keen.
Sure.
I´ll exercise Cigarette... bring in the wood, and dry the dishes.
You can stay with Flicka all the time... except when you´re sleeping.
Thanks, Hildy.
[Rooster Crows]
[Ring]
Gus, she´s going to be all right, isn´t she?
Pretty good chance... if we could get her to eat.
Maybe she don´t like oats.
I´ll get her some hay.
Whoa.
Don´t run away, Flicka.
Don´t be afraid of me.
I´m Ken.
This is hay.
You´ll like it.
Have some.
Take it easy.
She´s been scared pretty bad.
She´s eating.
She´s going to get well.
Ja.
It´s good sign.
Move her to the calf pasture.
There´s shade there and a running stream.
And she´ll be alone.
I thought horses like company.
Not her.
She´s a lone wolf.
She might jump out of the calf pasture and get away.
She won´t jump out.
She won´t jump anything for a long time.
[Whistling]
Ken. Breakfast.
Coming, Dad.
What´s he so chipper about this morning?
Flicka. She´s better.
Coming along, huh?
Mm-hmm.
She´s almost well.
The cuts are all healed up... and she´s eating like a horse.
Ooh.
Maybe we´re going to have a pleasant summer after all... if she doesn´t turn out to be another Rocket.
Oh, I hope not.
Ken, what kind of manners is that?
Sorry, Mom.
Morning, Dad.
Morning, Ken.
How were the ducks on the landing this morning?
What ducks on what landing?
Oh. Those.
Hardly noticed them.
Been so busy with Flicka.
Now that Flicka´s getting better... don´t forget you´ve got other duties.
Oh, yes, sir.
Give some time to your colt... but not all your time.
I won´t.
Will you come down... and look at Flicka this morning... see how she is?
Will Her Highness let you get near her?
Well, not too close.
She´s still a little scared.
But she´ll let you look at her... from the other side of the fence.
That´s big of her.
After breakfast, I´ll take a look.
Oh, swell.
Ooh!
Kenny.
Good morning, Flicka.
Flicka, Dad´s coming to look at you.
Be a good girl and don´t run away.
Well, she does look good.
Her cuts are all healed up... except for the one on the right front leg.
It´s almost well.
She´s beautiful.
Dad?
Do you think she´s... loco?
I´d have sworn it by the way she´s behaved... ever since she was born.
In fact, we´ve never seen her... except when she´s looked terrified.
Every horse looks wild in the eye... when it´s terrified.
She tried jumping that fence.
Anyone can try the impossible once.
There´s the old saying--
::It couldn´t be done... but the darn fool did it anzway.´´
Horses have jumped over 6 feet.
Maybe Flicka thought she could do it.
We´ll forgive her that one.
Point is, will she learn?
Can she learn?
Rocket couldn´t.
Or wouldn´t.
Dad, maybe I´ll never get her trained.
Heavens, Son, what have I been telling you... all these weeks?
Didn´t you understand?
What did you think loco meant?
Sort of goofy or wild-- hard to handle.
Oh, no, Son.
Much more serious than that.
There´s inherited insanity among animals... just as there is among humans.
Bad blood carries on... and albino blood isn´t safe for any filly to have.
But you said... maybe it´s just because she´s been scared.
She´s got a very intelligent face.
Much better than Rocket´s.
Fine, delicate mouth.
And such lovely eyes.
Mm-hmm.
Set far apart.
We´ll have to see how she responds to training.
How can I train her?
All you can do is try and win her confidence.
You know, Son, if you take everything away... from a living creature-- freedom, friends, its home, habits... happiness-- it´ll turn in sheer need and desperation... to the one thing that´s left.
In this case, that´s you.
Me?
Yes. You´re her whole life now.
Make her to like it.
Oh, I will, Dad.
I will.
Give her love and companionship.
Talk to her.
Will she understand me?
Of course.
A horse can tell you a lot of things, too... if you watch and expect it to be sensible and intelligent.
Pay attention to all the little signs.
The way it moves its body.
The ears. The eyes.
The whinnies.
That´s its way of talking, Ken.
That´s right.
There´s a neigh of terror.
A scream of rage.
A whinny of nervous impatience.
[Flicka Snorts]
The nicker of longing or hunger... or friendliness.
You learn its language, and it´ll learn yours.
And never forget-- horses understand everything you say to them.
Everything, Dad?
Everything.
[Flicka Snorts]
You mean... if they´re not loco.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
All right, all right... you´re hungry for your oats... but I´m hurrying as fast as I can.
There.
There you are.
Come and get it.
Good, isn´t it?
You do understand me, don´t you, Flicka?
Eat it all so you´ll be big and strong like Banner.
You´ve got a very smart father, Flicka.
You´ve got to forget all your wild ways... and be just like him.
Who are you talking to?
Flicka.
Aw, horses can´t understand people´s talk.
That´s all you know.
Flicka understands everything I say.
What´s more, she talks back to me.
Aw, poo.
Maybe you don´t know it... but horses got a language all their own.
There´s a neigh of terror... a scream of rage... a whinny of nervous impatience... a nicker of longing--
Eee-h-h-h!
There´s a nicker of hunger.
R-r-r-r.
Can you wiggle your ears?
Oh...
[Whinny]
What´s she saying now?
Oh, she´s telling me she´s finished her oats.
Oh.
Maybe she´s saying thank you, too.
Maybe she wants more oats.
[Whinny]
Maybe she´s had too many.
Maybe she´s got a pain in her stomach.
Maybe she needs some castor oil.
Only gluttons need castor oil.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
She wants something.
Oh, I know.
She´s thirsty.
Why don´t you go and get a drink?
There´s a whole lake full of water.
Oh, all right.
Boy, you sure are getting spoiled.
Oh, gosh. I forgot.
Your Pop´s back.
For Pete´s sake.
Why didn´t you tell me?
I´ve got to see him right away!
[Whinny]
You hear that?
That means she doesn´t want me to go.
Aw, I betcha it just means... she´s got gas on her stomach.
[Whinny]
Bet you I didn´t forget anything this time.
Flour, salt, ham--
What about my hairpins?
How could I forget anything as important as hairpins?
They´re in there.
Dad!
Dad, did you get it?
Get what?
You know.
Sorry. I forgot all about it.
You did get it, didn´t you?
Sure, I did.
It´s a beauty.
Where is it?
Well,just a minute, Son.
Your work done?
Yes, sir.
Did you exercise
Cigarette?
Yes, sir.
She´s in her own pasture... and I tied the gate.
Good. Is she hot?
No, sir. I cooled her off on the way home.
Give her a good workout?
Yes, sir, and I didn´t lose or break anything.
Good work, Son.
You´re really coming along.
Can I have it now?
It´s in the front seat.
You were right, Nell.
The filly sure did the trick.
He´s a changed boy.
Flicka!
Flicka, I´ve got something for you!
Look. Brand-new saddle blanket.
Tailor-made especially for you.
Isn´t it keen?
When you grow up, we´ll put it on you.
Won´t even know you´ve got a saddle on your back.
We´ll go riding on the range... fly like the wind.
Look.
Got your name on it.
Oh, Flicka, I didn´t mean to scare you.
Honest, I didn´t.
Come back, Flicka.
Oh, please come back.
You don´t have to have it.
I won´t ever ride you... or put a saddle on you... if you don´t want me to.
You´ll just be my friend.
[Whinny]
Mom... did you ever want anything terribly?
Most everyone wants something, dear.
But you´ve grown up.
You´re married.
You´ve got Dad and me.
Why, you´re finished.
Then I shouldn´t still be wanting, should I... if I´m finished?
But people do, Ken.
Everyone?
Always, Mom?
Don´t you ever really get finished?
Yeah, I wonder.
Maybe sometimes, for a minute or two.
What is it you want now, Ken?
I do so want Flicka to be all right and not loco.
Oh, perhaps she isn´t loco, dear.
We don´t know yet for sure... but if she is, Ken... wanting won´t change it.
If she is, it´ll look bad for her, won´t it?
Let´s see what happens when we try to halter-break her.
Does she have to be?
We´ve got to find out, don´t we?
I suppose so.
As soon as she´ll let you touch her... we´ll have a try at it.
What if she won´t let us?
She loves you, doesn´t she?
Oh, yes.
I´m sure she does.
Well, that shows she´s intelligent.
How does it, Mom?
It´s just a way of putting away fear.
Don´t you understand,
Ken... that if you find love... if a person or an animal finds love... it´s the same as finding safety.
It´s comfort and friendliness and help.
Everyone longs for it.
And if Flicka´s found it... and yet doesn´t have sense enough... to know she´s found it... and goes around being crazy and silly with fear, then--
Then she´d be loco.
[Humming]
Good morning.
Where´d you catch them?
At that deep hole under the falls.
Put them in here.
Thank you.
Well, Boss, what today?
Look over the mowing machines.
We have to get at the haying soon.
Those stackers need repairs.
Oh, Gus.
Before we begin...
I want to help Ken halter-break his filly.
I want you and Tim to be on hand.
Where, Boss?
The calf pasture, and we´ll do it right now.
But, Dad, maybe... maybe we better wait a little while.
She´ll let you close to her now, won´t she?
Oh, yes.
Flicka´s my friend now.
She likes me, but--
Good. I´m glad to hear that.
It´s a fine thing to have a horse for a friend.
Flicka´s never had a rope around her neck.
She may fight us putting one on her now.
Maybe she´ll act like she did when she arrived.
Maybe she´ll act like Rocket.
She has to be halter-broken sometime.
Might as well get it over with.
Get ready.
I´ll be right down.
Didn´t you find a broken mule shoe last night?
Yes.
That´s good luck, ain´t it?
Yes, but if I make a mistake...
Dad may blame it on Flicka.
And then he wouldn´t--
Call her, Ken.
Flicka!
Have your loop ready, Tim.
[Whistles]
Put your bandanna around her neck.
Tie it in a loose knot.
Easy, Flicka. Easy.
Now take your belt off.
Slip it through the bandanna.
Now take ahold of the belt and lead her around.
All right.
Now bring her back.
Let go of the loop.
Hold your hand under her chin.
That´s it.
I´d call that halter-broken.
But it isn´t a halter, Dad.
You really take some convincing, young man.
All right. Give us the halter, Gus.
There you are.
Put it on her.
Go ahead, Son.
But how, Dad?
Just the way you put it on Cigarette.
All right, now lead her around again.
How did she get halter-broke, Dad?
That´s the way we break horses... on the Goose Bar ranch.
You figure it out, Ken.
Come on, boys.
Let´s get at those machines.
Then she´s not loco.
She´s not loco.
You could have knocked me down with a feather.
I knew she liked me pretty well, but gosh... she let me halter-break her... without even an argument.
Flicka´s a smart filly, just like her father.
All girls are smart like their pops.
[Whinny]
She´s calling me.
She sure is, Kenny.
That´s the nicker of friendliness.
Bet you she´s just hungry.
Gus, something´s happened to her!
She´s limping.
Something´s wrong with her front leg.
Flicka, what´s the matter?
What´s happened to you?
It´s that barbed-wire cut.
But that was all healed up.
But it didn´t heal right.
The leg´s swollen.
Is that bad?
Means infection.
Infection? That´s dangerous, isn´t it?
You betcha.
Hildy, you talk too much.
I think it hurts her.
She ain´t bearing any weight on it.
What do you do for a horse infection?
Just the same like for people-- put on poultice so it´ll drain.
I´ll get Mom to make a poultice.
Ja, I think you better.
She has got sense, hasn´t she, Mom?
She knows we´re helping her, doesn´t she?
Of course she does.
She´s a good little girl... and we´ll get her out of this in no time.
Slack off!.
Rip it!
Dad, I´d like to talk to you.
What about?
About Flicka.
For the love of Mike, can´t you see I´m busy?
Can´t be worrying about that filly.
I´m sorry, Dad.
Just a minute, Ken.
What is it, Son?
Flicka worse?
Dad, she´s so sick.
Will you come down and see her?
Maybe you can do something to help her.
All right. I´ll come have a look at her.
She´s lying down again.
Good heavens.
What´s happened to her?
She´s been getting awfully thin.
Thin!
I´m afraid she ain´t going to pull out of it.
Pull out of it?
She´s dead already.
How long´s she been like this?
She´s been real sick the last few days.
It´s the fever.
It´s burning her up.
She´s going to die.
We´ll have to put her out of her misery.
Oh, no, Dad.
I´m sorry, Ken.
It isn´t fair to an animal... to let it suffer like this.
Pick a time when
Ken isn´t around.
Gus!
Gus, when are you going to do it?
I was--I was going down soon now, Kenny.
Don´t do it tonight.
Wait till morning.
Just one more night.
Gus.
Well, in the morning, then.
It´s got to be done.
Your father gave the orders.
I know. I won´t say anything more.
[Dog Barks]
Shhh.
I´m coming, Flicka.
I´m coming.
Flicka?
Flicka, where are you?
Oh, my little Flicka.
Give him one of these every hour.
I´ll call to see him tomorrow morning.
He´s a very sick boy.
It isn´t only the cold and fever--
He had a shock,
Dr. Scott.
Something happened--
He´s been sad about a horse I gave him.
It´s been sick.
Oh, I see.
Well, you´d better have this prescription filled right away.
I´ll follow you into town... and bring it right back.
Don´t worry.
How is the little boy,
Missus?
Gus, he´s so sick.
Poor little boy.
[Thunder]
Gus, is Flicka dead?
No. Tim and me fixed her up in a blanket sling.
She can´t stand alone... but she drank a bucket of water.
Did Rob say you didn´t have to shoot her?
No, but I couldn´t do it.
When I found them like that this morning, I--
I know what you mean.
She´s got plenty of strength.
Sometimes I think, Gus, miracles can still happen.
It was the water washing the fever out of her... but it was Ken giving her courage.
All night that little fella sitting by her... saying, ::Hold on, Flicka.
::I´m here with you.
The two of us together.´´
I´ll tell Ken.
Maybe it will help him get well... knowing she´s still alive.
There´s a storm coming up, Missus.
I´ll stay here if you need me.
Thank you, Gus.
[Thunder]
I thought you´d never get here.
How is he?
Better. He´s been resting.
Good. We need some hot water.
Did you do as I told you?
Boss, I couldn´t.
I gave the order, and you´ve had plenty of time.
I just couldn´t do it.
Where´s the rifle?
In the bunkhouse.
Go get it.
Oh, Rob, please don´t.
He knows she´s alive.
He thinks she´ll get well.
Give him something to hope for.
[Thunder]
Would have been better if she were shot weeks ago.
It´s been nothing but misery for everyone.
Look what it´s done to Ken.
I wish you wouldn´t, Rob.
He needn´t know.
He´ll hear the shot.
He´ll think it´s thunder.
He´ll know it´s the rifle.
I´m sorry, but... it´s just no good letting sick animals live.
It´s raining.
The rain won´t hurt her, darling.
Flicka´s been out in thunderstorms all her life.
That was Dad´s car, wasn´t it, Mom?
Yes, dear.
[Whinny]
[Growl]
Please, darling.
It was only the thunder.
[Whinny]
Don´t worry about the cat.
I´m staying with you for the night.
Feel a lot better if I had a drink... and some dry clothes.
I´m a drowned rat... but so are you.
Rob!
Oh, Rob.
Yeah?
You all right?
Sure.
Ken´s asleep.
Gus is with him.
I got worried about you.
[Whinny]
But I thought--
I heard a shot.
It was a mountain lion.
Did you get him?
I will before morning.
I couldn´t do it.
She wants to die, she´ll have to do it by herself.
Ken heard the shot.
How´d he take it?
Well, he took it.
He didn´t question it, he didn´t seem to rebel.
If he wakes up and asks... don´t tell him she´s still alive.
But, Rob--
She may be dead by morning.
Wouldn´t surprise me.
He´s accepted her death.
If he knows she´s still alive, he´ll be all upset again.
I won´t tell him.
[Nickers]
[Whinny]
Thanks, Flicka.
[Whinny]
Morning, Dad.
How do you feel this morning?
Much better, thanks.
Enough better to go out in the warm sunshine?
I guess so.
It´s doctor´s orders.
Come on. I´ll help you get dressed.
Dad...where are we going?
The calf pasture.
That´s right, Son.
[Whinny]
Flicka.
It is Flicka.
But I thought--
I didn´t shoot her.
I couldn´t.
That shot you heard?
That was the mountain lion.
I killed him.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Easy, Ken.
[Whinny]
Flicka.
[Whinny]
Oh, Flicka.
She did get gentle, didn´t she, Dad?
Gentle as a kitten.
She´s given us a lot of trouble, Son... but she´s taught us some important things, too.
You, responsibility.
Me, there is such a thing as hope beyond hope.
That sometimes, when things are at their lowest ebb... all we need do is have a little more love... a little more patience, and a little more faith.
Steamboat rounding the bend!
Steamboat rounding the bend!
- The boat's a day early.
- It is that.
I gotta go down to meet it.
My new entertainers are on the boat.
All right, make your bets before the wheel stops rolling.
Make your bet.
Chief!
Sam, put a couple of cases of champagne on the ice.
Right!
Chief, chief!
Where's my daughter, Lettie?
- Him backstage.
- Get me my hat and coat.
The boat's coming in, folks. It's a day early.
Lettie!
- Lettie!
- Yes, Pop?
Is that music mangler getting familiar?
Take your hands off of my daughter.
- Why, Pop.
- Don't you know that ain't modest?
What a thing to say, and about your own daughter, too.
I'm not talking to you, I don't like you.
Well, come on, the boat's docking, we got to meet the people.
You have to wait. I can't wear this dress.
I have to change.
I can't wait. I'll go by myself.
And you take my advice, keep away from that fella.
- I know a crook when I see one.
- Pop.
I bet he'd steal your shirt.
Well, speaking of shirts, isn't that one of mine?
Yes, I stole it. I borrowed it. Here.
- See what it says there?
- Nope.
Made in Paris.
I tell you, he's a suspicious character.
The boat!
Pardon.
Have I the honor and pleasure of addressing
Miss De Valle and her charming ladies?
And you don't have to tell me that you're my new employer, Honest John Calhoun.
I recognized you at once from your description.
I've heard so many wonderful things about you, Mr. Calhoun.
About how honest you are... how generous and free-handed with money.
Thanks. But I'm not Mr. Calhoun.
My name is Candless.
I am the manager of Honest John Calhoun's Emporium.
The finest establishment in the northwest.
You may call me Pop.
Very well, Pop. That'll do.
Till I can think up something better.
Ladies, this way to the carriages, please.
Ladies, the next carriage is right over here!
Get the champagne ready, boys.
All the champagne.
Come right in, ladies.
Right up to the bar, here we are.
Champagne for everybody.
This is on the house.
Sarsaparilla for me.
To Belle De Valle. The belle of the Yukon!
- Very fine vintage.
- Nothing but the best.
My sentiments exactly.
- I so admire a man who doesn't drink.
- I never touch it.
Anything I can do for you, Mr. Candless?
Mervin, you're just in time.
Ladies, ladies!
This is Mervin, the town marshal.
- Hello, Mervin.
- Hello, girls! Glad to meet you.
Mervin, our new star, Miss De Valle.
Chief, show the ladies to their rooms.
And Miss De Valle, if there's anything that I can do, command me.
Well, thank you.
Isn't he cute?
Howdy, brother. I'm looking for Mr. Calhoun.
Mr. Calhoun is up-country.
He's looking at a mining claim.
- He'll be back tonight.
- Thank you.
Sam Slade's my name.
Haven't I seen you someplace before?
No. Clear case of mistaken identity.
Bartender, would love to have some of your best jug whiskey.
- What do you want to see Mr. Calhoun for?
- Why, I'm looking for a job.
I'm the town marshal. What's your game?
Game? Well, I'm a peace officer by trade, but I see that job's filled.
Peace officer? You don't look tough enough to hold down a job like that.
I ain't tough.
I just keep other people from getting tough.
- Pretty fast with a gun, huh?
- I don't like guns.
- So you use a knife?
- No, I don't like knives either.
I had a cousin, Walter, that cut his thumb plumb off just whittling.
That learned me about knives.
No, I just use reason.
You know, talk to people.
That wouldn't work around here.
Brother, be careful with that knife, this suit cost $14.
Just how would you go about talking yourself out of a fix like this?
Well, I don't know offhand.
Kind of reminds me of my Uncle Gus.
Used to be Sheriff of Bedville.
Uncle Gus only had one hand.
So, of course, a fella with just one hand couldn't use a gun or a knife.
Why not? He has the other hand.
Yeah, but naturally in the other hand he had a jug, like that.
Fella's got to have him a jug.
You can see for yourself, he couldn't use a gun or a knife with a jug in one hand... the other hand all...
Drink, friend?
I take great pride and pleasure... in presenting the Nightingale of the North, my daughter, Lettie!
"Every girl is different. Either she's a beauty
"Or she's brainy
"Or the kind you call on when it's rainy
"Every girl is different
"One prefers a baker, one a barber"
"I prefer a man in every harbor"
For a moment I thought the fleet was in.
"Every girl is different
"Some would like a salesman,
Some a watchman"
"I like roaming in the gloaming with a Scotchman"
Don't forget those bagpipes, dearie.
"Oh, look at the Duchess with a snooty air about her

"Why don't you browse around my library some night?"
Hey, chief, what goes on?
Boat come in day early.
- Hi, Mr. Calhoun.
- Hello, George.
- Place is going great guns, eh?
- Looks that way.
You know, you could double your take in here, Calhoun.
Yeah, by letting you put crooked dice and roulette wheels in here... and filling the place with your bunko men.
- That is blunt, but true.
- True?
But nothing to worry about as long as we're behind you.
My answer's still the same: No.
You can carry this honesty thing too far.
Yeah, but that's just a difference of viewpoints, George.
Now, you take the short view, that is, make all you can while you can.
I take the long view.
Establish a reputation for honesty... and do business with the same people all through your life.
- But suppose that...
- Put that back.
- So long, Mr. Calhoun.
- So long.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Pop.
Who is that tall man standing over there?
- The one in the brown coat?
- Yes.
That's our boss, John Calhoun.
Honest John, eh?
Would you tell Mr. Calhoun
I'd like to see him in my dressing room?
- Say, Pop. How'd the show go?
- Great, great.
Miss De Valle would like to see you in her dressing room.
Miss De Valle? Oh, the new star.
Keep her happy.
- Miss De Valle.
- Come in.
Why, if it isn't our old friend, Mr. Jack.
- Viola.
- How are you?
We haven't seen you since you ditched us in Seattle.
We've talked about you a lot though.
And did my ears burn.
After you left, a jeweler came and took back that bracelet that you gave Honey... he said you didn't pay for it.
My goodness was there a to-do!
- Beer.
- Of course.
Why, that's the bracelet, isn't it?
The jeweler must have relented.
A very kind gentleman from Sioux City helped me out of my difficulties.
An elegant gentleman. A banker.
He didn't have much hair and he creaked a bit when he walked... but he certainly was a gentleman.
- Viola!
- All right, I'm going, I'm going.
You look great.
Belle De Valle. I like your new name.
I assure you, I didn't change it for the same reason as you changed yours.
What's your game up here?
I've got the greatest proposition in the world. I've turned honest.
And I'm sweet 16 and never been kissed.
It's on the level.
I figured
I ought to make something out of myself.
Amount to something in the world.
Come back and offer you my name and fortune.
You were thinking only of me?
But you don't have to believe me unless you want to.
I don't believe you.
You're just worried that I'll send word to the Seattle Police.
Telling them the whereabouts of one Gentleman Jack.
Now you wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
Oh, no? First time you misbehave.
Now, skidoo. I have to change.
You can join me for supper.
- With wine.
- With wine.
And get this straight. No more playing around with that little red-headed singer.
You've got that all wrong.
We're just friends, we're just...
- Is platonic the word you're looking for?
- Yeah, platonic.
When you turn platonic, wolves will be vegetarians.
I'll be ready in a few minutes so you stay on tap.
And remember, don't get any ideas.
From now on, you fetch and carry when I whistle.
I don't know why you insist on hanging on to me.
You always did all right without me.
Sure I did all right without you.
But with you it's more fun.
Say, I'll tell you a nice number.
You know McGee?
- McGee who?
- Well, it's a song. Listen.
You know,
When You And I Was Young, McGee.
- Yeah, I know it.
- You know it?
- Let's go. You ready?
- Ready.
Thank you.
- I'm Calhoun, you want to see me?
- Yes, sir.
Come over to the office.
Pop Candless, shake hands with Sam Slade.
He's working here.
How are you?
Now I remember you.
We worked together on Winslow's Carnival.
You had the roll down and count.
And you were the short change artist.
- Well! Remember Chili Carthy?
- The sheriff with the long coat?
- Pop, see that everything outside is all right.
- Sure.
Sam, it's good to see you.
What took you so long?
Missed the boat.
I've come to take you home.
Wait just a minute, will you?
I want you to hear this.
All right.
My, that's lovely.
- Why don't you try it?
- All right.
Lately I find myself out gazing
at stars
Hearing guitars
Like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me
Lately I seem to walk
as though I had wings
Bump into things
Like someone in love
Each time I look at you
I'm limp as a glove
And feeling
like someone in love
"Like someone in love."
Hey, Pop!
Me rob piano player's room.
Don't say rob, this is an investigation.
All right, me investigate room. Steal him.
The cur!
Get me a pencil and paper.
You're going to travel, you're going to Nome.
More sarsaparilla.
"Seattle Police, Seattle.
"Steve Atterbury is here.
"Come and get him."
Will you tell Mr. Calhoun that supper is served?
You know, this reminds me of when I was young and gay.
Cold bottle and a hot bird, and love.
- Isn't it grand?
- It is, but often it's only indigestion. Go on.
John, listen!
I thought I told you to stay off that stuff!
What's a man going to do when he finds out that his only daughter... has fallen in love with an international crook. A bigamist!
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Steve Atterbury, the crook.
Our piano player? He's harmless.
Listen.
"Dearest Steve, I hope this letter will reach you...
"and that you will decide to come home and face the music.
"Sherry.
"P.S. The children miss you very much."
The heartless brute.
When I think of those poor little children a-weeping and a-wailing.
With no father to bounce them on his knee... and wipe their little noses.
So Steve's on the run, eh?
I'll find him and tell him he'd better get out of town.
No need to do that.
I've already put a spoke in that villain's wheel.
I sent a runner to Nome with a wireless to the Seattle Police... to come up and get that dirty crook.
Why, you whiskey-soaked idiot!
Didn't you realize if the Seattle cops ever light here... we'll all have to take it on the run?
I think I'll drift on a few hundred miles.
I forgot you're wanted in Seattle.
Forgot.
Hello, Viola. I'm busy.
Miss De Valle says supper's ready and she's waiting.
Tell her I'll be along in a minute.
And remember,
Miss De Valle doesn't like waiting.
What are we gonna do?
I'll send another runner with a wireless to the Seattle Police... telling them their man is in Nome.
- Come on.
- Where we going now?
To see that Steve gets on that boat to Nome tonight.
Good!
You better go sleep it off.
That peak must be 15,000 feet high, and it's perpetually covered with snow.
- It's one of the highest in North America.
- No.
- No what?
- No lectures, no statistics, that's what.
Not tonight anyway.
Every time we're alone together, you find something else to talk about besides...
Well, besides...
Well?
Well, it just seems a shame to waste all that moonlight.
Wonderful moon.
Lettie, you know how I feel about you.
I don't have to tell you.
Maybe that's how people know when they're in love.
Words aren't necessary.
And I know you're in love with me.
You're very conceited. But absolutely right.
It's like this.
I haven't any right to take you in my arms.
I got in some trouble back home and until that's straightened out, well...
I just haven't any right.
You see that, don't you?
Because when a fella kisses a girl like you he's gotta say, "I love you..." and, "Let's get married in a hurry."
Well, I can't say that.
So you see how it is, I just can't kiss you.
I see.
But I do love you.
And if I had the right, I'd take you in my arms and I'd tell you I love you.
Do you understand?
I understand it'd be very improper for you... to kiss me under the circumstances.
- Now, I better walk home with you.
- All right.
Well, I really have to go in now.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I better not kiss you goodbye, someone might be looking.
- Besides, you're not supposed to.
- That's right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Cast off all lines, sir!
Here you are.
What do you want me to do, drown him?
No, just untie him when you get down the river a ways.
Take it easy, friend. You got lots of time.
- He's on his way.
- Good.
You got some change coming.
Only gave him $100.
Stand by, sir.
Them bells sure do sound pretty.
Always did like the sound of bells.
I remember one time...
Belle. I forget all about her.
Steve's new tune. Isn't it lovely?
You're just a little bit stuck on that fella, aren't you kid?
Nope. I'm not a little bit stuck on him.
I'm madly in love with him.
And I'm gonna marry him and have 13 children all in steps like this.
Boat's leaving, Pop.
Yeah, I know.
Steve's on it.
I know it's tough, kid.
Don't you think you better go up and get some sleep?
Good night.
John! Steve's on that boat.
I know.
Lettie, he's not worth crying over.
I'm not crying 'cause I want to.
Come on, come on. Keep your chin up.
- Honey, it's me.
- Come in.
That's the trail there.
Malemute's just a little ways ahead.
All right, thanks.
Next time you take a swim, don't forget to take your clothes off.
Come on, boy.
Better hurry, Lettie.
You're on in a few minutes.
I'm hurrying.
Tears are tough on the mascara, aren't they?
Here, let me help.
Is this the first time you've had your heart broken?
You're not gonna tell me it can happen more than once.
The heart is like one of those old Chinese vases.
It can have enough cracks in it to look like a spider web... but it'll still hold together.
What's the cure, if there is one?
Time.
Diamond bracelet helps speed things up.
A new hat.
The best thing's to get mad.
Break something.
Over the guy's head if possible.
- Lettie.
- Steve.
- I've got to talk to you.
- About what?
About that mess in Seattle.
- Is it true?
- Well, of course it's true, but I can explain it.
See, Lettie, after last night I didn't want you to think that there was any...
Look, I'm late for my number and there's no need of explaining.
When a fella and a girl with nothing much to do go for a walk in the moonlight... it almost always has to end up in that type of conversation.
Just as it almost always has to end up in a kiss.
Don't worry.
I'm late. Goodbye.
If I were the type to play around
it wouldn't be so bad
But I didn't know my way around
and what a time I had
I was taken for
a sleigh ride in July
Oh, I must have been a set up
for a sigh
A mockingbird was whistling
a sentimental tune
and I didn't know enough to come in
out of the moonlight
So the big romance
was only make believe
Just a sleigh ride
on a balmy summer eve
My dreams were safe all winter
and then to think that I
was taken for
a sleigh ride in July
Stop crying and get mad.
I can't get mad. I just want to bawl.
Just remember. A woman is always at her worst when she's bawling.
Or at least will be until they invent a powder and rouge that won't melt.
I guess I've been made an awful fool of.
Sucker is the word. Now get out there.

Mervin, you know Steve, my piano player.
- Yeah, I hear he left town.
- Well, he's back.
He's been tapping my cash register.
There he is.
I hope you don't want him arrested.
It ain't that I'm kindhearted, Mr. Calhoun.
But it's too much trouble sweeping out the jail and bringing him his meals.
- I'll just run him out of town.
- No, he had that chance.
Now lock him up, and I'll tell you what to do with him later.
- Coming peaceable?
- No!
You didn't know when you was well-off.
I reckon you just want to see the inside of my jail.
- Morning, boss. Morning, Miss De Valle.
- Morning, Sam.
Say, you're pretty near out of dog, ain't you?
He's a cute little fella. Let me.
Come here, come here.
Say, he makes war talk, though.
I took care of that little matter, boss.
It'll be done this morning.
- Good.
- Here. You carry him, will you?
Belle, don't you think I look kind of silly carrying him?
Don't be foolish. You look very domestic.
I like you this way.
I always said if you devoted half the time to work... that you do to thinking up those confidence games... you'd be a very successful business man.
Hey, Mr. Calhoun! You look mighty silly.
Big man like you carrying a little dog like that.
- Prof. Salisbury.
- Yes?
I don't think you remember me, sir.
I ran a pack train for you when you made your survey in South America.
Yes, of course.
- This is Miss De Valle, Professor.
- Miss De Valle.
The Professor's the world's greatest authority on the weather.
- Come now.
- Yes, it's true.
He made the North Atlantic surveys... which have saved the lives of thousands of fishermen.
Really?
You're the first professor I ever saw.
I always thought they wore plug hats.
This is the town marshal, Professor.
Just the man I wanted to see.
I have here the data from the United States Government Bureau... on my two-year study of Alaskan weather conditions.
I'd like to deposit them in a safe place until I can leave for the States.
Why not put them in the safe in my place?
Marshal, take the Professor down to the Emporium.
Sure.
- Thank you very much. See you later, I trust.
- Certainly.
Right this way, Professor.
This is it. Come in for a moment.
This isn't San Francisco.
There's nothing you'd want in here.
A corset string is a corset string and I just broke mine.
- Be there in just a minute, Mr. Calhoun.
- No hurry.
The latest thing in straws.
Look, the only guy who would wear this would be a grade B idiot... on his way to the fireman's picnic.
- Anything I can do for you?
- Yes, a corset string, please.
We might have one in the stock room.
I'll take a look.
Yeah.
This is the hat.
- Nix, nix.
- This is a dream!
I like that fellow. He appeals to me.
Business man. Money in the bank, good reputation around town.
- Certainly.
- Takes up the collection in church.
- They can trust him with it.
- Of course.
- I like him.
- His wife probably has to help the maid.
I still like him.
I wouldn't mind helping the maid.
You'd be out of character.
You're the type that needs waiting on.
Just lately. I used to be the type that came from a family of nine.
I did the cooking, sewing, while my younger brothers and sisters were growing up.
But you were glad to get away from all that.
No, I don't think you'd like this kind of fellow.
Keep it.
I'd rather you were wearing it when I say this.
And if you laugh, I'll run a hat pin right through your vest pocket.
Let's get married.
Well, I'm not sure I like your being quite so surprised.
- Well, it's so sudden.
- I'm supposed to say that.
I never thought that you...
Of course not. Not when you're one jump ahead of the police at all times.
But you've changed. Now you even insist on taking a morning walk.
You've never got out of bed before noon unless the mattress caught on fire.
- You're different in a lot of ways.
- Am I?
We might find this all very boring.
I wouldn't. I promise.
Jack, this is all on the level, isn't it?
Of course it's on the level.
I'm as honest as the day is long.
That's wonderful. I haven't been so happy since the night you gave me the bracelet.
I wouldn't want another disappointment like that.
No, of course not. Everything's set.
And so, gentlemen, when the reports are published... you people of Alaska will no longer be at the mercy of the elements.
You will know when to expect changes in temperature.
No longer will the intrepid traveler of the northern wastes... be caught out on a trail by sudden cold spells and left to die.
You mean that you'll be able to tell when the freeze-up's coming in advance?
Unfortunately, we of the Government Weather Bureau... have not yet reduced our prognostications to an exact science.
We are occasionally in error.
Our predictions have sometimes missed by as much as 12 hours.
That'll be great. You know, if we can know within a day... when a freeze-up's coming, that'll sure save a lot of lives.
- This is yours if you open that.
- What for?
- I want a look at the Professor's report.
- I couldn't do that.
- See you later, Mervin.
- Thanks for the drink.
Hello, Mervin.
If a big fella had you in a fix like this what would you do?
How'd you talk your way out?
Mervin, the fix you got me in now reminds me a whole lot... of a fella I used to know down home.
Fella by the name of Hod Durning.
He was a great big fella like you...
- and he was cross-eyed, just like you.
- But I ain't cross-eyed.
I don't mean cross-eyed exactly,
I mean he had a cast in his eye like you.
I haven't got a cast in my eye, look.
Well, you're right, Mervin.
You ain't got no cast in your eye.
All right. Talk yourself out of this.
Hey, I'm on fire, I'm on fire!
I'm on fire, I tell you, put me out!
This your gun? Drink, friend?
- Mr. Calhoun.
- Hello, George.
What are you gonna do, a little gambling?
You wouldn't really call it gambling.
You mind if I use one of your tables?
- No, help yourself.
- Thanks.
Boys, let Mr. Maitland use this table.
- Game's closed, men, cash your checks.
- Thank you, boys, thank you very much.
Like to do a little gambling on the freeze-up date, boys?
Little too early for that.
We don't usually start until late in the fall.
What's your idea on the freeze-up date?
I got 3,000 ounces of dust, two to one that says the river freezes up... by September 15.
You're crazy. She ain't never froze before October 1.
Just put your money where your mouth is,
I say September 15.
I'll take 30 ounces of that.
- You got a bet. Get his name, Frank.
- Spike Roberts.
- When did you say the freeze-up was?
- September 15.
- I'll take 20 ounces of that. McClusky.
- I'll take 40 ounces. Tambrook.
- What did you say the odds were?
- Two to one.
Give me 10 ounces, Mills. 10 ounces.
- They fell?
- With a bang.
Avarice, avarice.
Man's greed always leads him to his downfall.
Your smart friends will undoubtedly be making some substantial bets... on the freeze-up date.
Are your men covering as much of the money as possible?
Not a cent. I don't believe in gambling of any type.
Well, I don't see how you stand to make a profit.
I do.
I wouldn't stay around here if I were you.
Leave while the suckers are happy.
An old rule of mine.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Anybody else think I'm crazy?
- We're all cleaned out.
- Who's gonna hold the stakes?
That's a lot of dust.
4,500 ounces of temptation.
Well, the Marshal here can keep it at the jail and watch it.
- Well, who's gonna watch the Marshal?
- You questioning my character?
Folks. Why not let Mr. Calhoun here hold it?
He may not be the only honest man in town, but he's the only one I know.
No, I don't want to hold the stakes.
But gentlemen... what's happened here tonight proves one thing we need in Malemute.
And that's a bank. I suggest a committee of citizens get together... and select some reputable member of the community to start one.
Now, the man selected should be sober... industrious, honest, and of good integrity.
- Nice billing.
- It was forced on me.
Good morning, Mr. Calhoun.
- I want to open a savings account.
- Yes, ma'am.
Why, Viola!
I thought it'd be safer here than in a mattress.
- What name, please?
- Viola Chase.
- A checking or savings account?
- Savings account, please.
- Be ready in just a minute, Mr. Calhoun.
- All right.
- What is that?
- It was a boiler, now a vault.
- There you are, sir.
- Thanks, Smitty.
Take a ton of dynamite to blow that baby.
My happiness is tinged with a certain amusement.
Doesn't it seem odd that you should be custodian of other people's money?
That's like setting a tiger to mind a baby.
What's the old saying about a tiger changing his spots?
Leopards have spots.
- Do I have to start acting dignified?
- Why?
A banker's wife has to be dignified.
Did you locate the minister yet?
No. Not yet.
Sent runners up and down the river but they haven't found him.
Alby will be here in a couple of weeks on his regular circuit.
A couple of weeks? I can hardly wait.
Not that I'm impatient or anything but... a Madam Lucille once told me that there's one thing a girl can't be too quick about.
- You're happy about this, aren't you?
- Sure.
I've never had much faith in banks but I happen to know the president of this one.
- I'd like to open an account.
- I shall be delighted, Miss De Valle.
- A checking or savings account?
- Both.
Mr. Calhoun.
- May we have your signature, please?
- Certainly.
- Mr. Calhoun, I got a problem.
- Yeah, what is it?
That piano player's ruining my whole life.
I spend all of my time waiting on him.
Do you think he's grateful?
Nothing suits him.
- He's always batting me.
- I tell you what you do.
Tonight, take him to Nome.
They got a good jail there.
Leave him and send a wire to the
Seattle Police saying they can pick him up.
That's the smartest thing I ever heard of.
On top of which, I got a girl in Nome who'll be mighty glad to see me. I hope.
- Thank you, Mr. Calhoun, thank you.
- Think nothing of it, Marshal.
If you ever run short, don't go to strangers.
You and me's going for a little ride.
I won't put these on you if you promise not to bat me. Promise?
I told you and told you to quit batting me in the jaw.
First thing you know, you're gonna make me mad.
Get up.
Marshal. There you are.
- Officer, do your duty.
- Go away!
- Arrest me. I know my constitutional rights.
- Go away!
- Arrest me. I got $700.
- Get off me, you big moron.
I got $700 and the jail is the only place in this town...
- Will you get out of here?
...where a man with $700 is safe!
- Arrest me...
- Get off.
...or you'll be derelicting your duties!
Go away, will you, you bore me.
Mervin, look at me.
See how mad that'll make you.
The key, where is it?
- Was it a big key, or just a little one?
- The handcuffs.
Let's look out there. More light.
- Prof. Salisbury.
- How do you do?
I ask you, sir, is this right?
I have been arrested in every state in the Union. And in several territories.
Once in south Memphis,
I was forced to build roads...
- and again in Chattanooga I had...
- Get up.
- But the key, George!
- Shut up!
So you've been in a lot of jails.
Well, you and I are gonna have a little talk.
Well.
The bank's been robbed!
Wait for me!
- I want all the dust you got in that boiler.
- Well, of all the...
Now, look here, you!
- How'd you tumble?
- Your professor got drunk and talked.
That was a pretty plan. When did you figure to grab the dust and run?
About the day after tomorrow.
Open it up. I'll do the running.
Honest John Calhoun.
You almost had me fooled.
All right, everybody sit down.
Very pretty.
All right, Mervin, start taking it out.
- Ever been to a lynching, George?
- No.
You will.
You'll be playing a most important part.
You can't get away. Those miners will run you down even if you have a two-day start.
- How were you gonna get away?
- On the Alaskan Star.
She arrives Wednesday and leaves Thursday... but I see I can't operate without you and you can't operate without me.
Why don't we just take this dust and quit all the jabbering.
You're a smooth character, Calhoun.
Looks like there's gonna be quite a party of us leave Thursday night... on the Alaskan Star. Partners?
Nothing like company to make a pleasant voyage.
That's right. But either Mervin or me will be dropping in to the Emporium... every couple of hours.
And if any one of the four of you are missing, it's gonna be rough.
I'll start yelling and there'll be a posse of miners on every trail.
- Until Thursday.
- Come on, Mervin, bring the empties.
- But George, I don't understand...
- Come on.
Looks as though you gentlemen are going to have to split more ways than you figured.
Give me a hand, boys.
Right pretty, huh?
It's pretty all right but it ain't gold.
- Where I come from we call it sand.
- Are you sure?
I got fooled with this once before.
I come pretty near marrying a homely widow with 40 acres of this stuff.
I knew those mugs would never get the best of us.
Come on, Sam.
Of course, you always intended showing your partners the real plan.
You don't think
I'd double-cross my partners, do you?
Not to give you a short answer, yes.
I suppose this is an unpleasant surprise.
I remember the old saying:
"The tiger cannot change his stripes nor the leopard his spots."
Well, what are you going to do?
I'd give a substantial reward for the answer to that question.
I wouldn't walk across the street with you.
You're acting a whole lot different from the girl I used to know.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
And as far as I'm concerned it can be the last.
Now, Mama always said, "Many a honest heart is concealed behind a simple face."
Well, your face is concealing something.
Marshal.
Too bad your prisoner got away,
I understand he outsmarted you.
Nobody better start picking on me.
I've had a very trying day and my nerves is all on edge.
I ain't picking on you, Marshal.
Just reminded me of a fella we had down home one time.
He let his prisoner get away from him and at the next election...
Talk your way out of this if you're such a much.
Well, I don't know just what to do.
Looks like you got me this time.
But you know, I just happened to think of what my Aunt Puny used to say.
She was my sickly aunt.
And when she got in a spot where she didn't know what to do... she'd just faint. Like this.
Here you are, Mervin.
Now, Aunt Puny used to say that in case of a nose bleed... put something cold to the back of the neck and it'll stop it.
This your gun?
Drink, friend?
Mervin, you and Sam look around town and pick up Steve.
He's as good as here.
Girls, I heard Pop sound curfew a half hour ago.
- Good night, Mr. Calhoun.
- Good night.
- Any luck?
- No.
Looked all over town for that young fella.
Can't find him no place.
- Are you the town marshal?
- I'm him.
The Alaskan Star hailed me coming up the river...
- and the Captain asked me to give you this.
- Thanks.
- What does it say?
- Official business.
You know you can't read.
I was gonna get somebody to read it for me later.
- You don't have to tell everybody.
- "To the Peace Officer of Malemute.
"Please hold for our arrival one Steven Atterbury."
We gotta find that fella tonight if we have to run this town through a sieve.
- Why tonight?
- So that Mervin can hand him to the cops... before they get off the boat.
If them cops start snooping around this town too much... some of us are gonna be very unhappy.
Come on.
Mervin. Throw that drunken Indian out.
Funny thing.
Never saw a blond Indian before.
Here he is!
Open up!
I'll give $1,000 to the man who gets him.
He went that way.
- What do you want?
- Nothing.
- Who are you?
- Nobody.
- Who's that?
- It's me, Steve.
- Steve!
- Lettie, I have to talk to you.
Say, you must have a pretty broad-minded wife... to let you come charging into girls's bedrooms this way.
Yeah, but they're chasing me.
And the police from Seattle are gonna be here in the morning.
- You've gotta listen to me.
- Don't try to lie out of it, Steve.
I know you got a wife and children in Seattle.
You're out of your mind!
What's all this nonsense?
Somebody tells you an idiotic lie about me and you believe them.
- That's love, I say...
- Come out of there with your hands up!
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.
Excuse me, Miss Lettie.
I thought I heard a man talking.
You mean talking like this?
I sometimes do that in my sleep.
You know, I could have sworn
I heard a man talking in here.
Well, you can see there's no one here.
I can see now.
- Steve.
- No kids, no wife. Believe me.
I do.
I believe you, I do!
Woman, you're hindering the law.
Well, there goes my $1,000.
I've got him!
I tried to give you a chance, young fella.
Too bad you didn't have sense enough to take advantage of it.
When do I get the $1000?
When you hand him to the police on the Alaskan Star in the morning.
And see that you don't lose him between now and then.
You want me to help you watch him, Marshal?
No!
Help watch him.
Little man... you're worth 1,000 of Mr. Calhoun's dollars dead... just the same as alive.
So try anything you like.
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Calhoun.
Sit right down. There's an extra cup and the coffee's piping hot.
I always say that coffee should be clear as crystal...
- hot as the devil...
- And black as a thief's heart.
- Good morning.
- Is it?
- Some coffee?
- No coffee.
It'll do you good.
Lay out those dresses, Viola.
No coffee.
Mr. Calhoun, I know at heart you're just a diamond in the rough... but your barking doesn't frighten me a bit.
Diamonds don't bark. Pack those dresses.
So that's your decision.
You're cutting loose from me.
Spurned is the word they use in books.
It'll do.
Have some sense. I've got a tiger by the tail.
It's a choice between my skin and the kid's.
You wouldn't want me to put my neck in a noose, would you?
- Or would you?
- I'm considering.
If you feel that way, all you have to do is speak to the right people... and I'd be wearing a heavy iron bracelet.
- Pack this?
- Yes.
- Well, why don't you tell the police?
- I don't know.
Maybe being in love has something to do with it.
There's a whole epidemic of soft-heartedness around here.
- Don't worry. You're immune.
- I certainly am.
I think you'll change your mind.
And come running back to you?
Maybe a gentleman wouldn't say this, but I'd bet my last dollar that you will.
Well, don't you worry about what a gentleman would say. Now get out.
Are those tears?
The day I cry over a man... will be a day just like this.
Oh, Steve.
Stand by, sir.
Throw the line, sir.
- Let them alone.
- But l...
But you can't go over there. I'm giving them a chance to say goodbye decent.
I'm just a sentimental man at heart, I guess.
Stand by engine, sir.
Don't they make a pretty couple?
Both engines, full astern, sir.
- That's arson, ain't it?
- What?
- Him already having a wife and family.
- It's murder.
- But you can't reason with her.
- All right, stand back folks, gangway.
Gangway.
I'll tell these coppers to treat you nice on the boat.
Thanks.
Steve, darling!
- Sherry!
- I'm so glad you're here!
What a surprise. Lettie, this is Sherry.
My sister.
Your sister?
Well.
- Pop, this is Sherry, his sister.
- Then it was her that wrote the letter.
I didn't even know you had a sister.
He has two others and three younger brothers. The children miss you so much.
- So I heard.
- Sure takes a load off of my mind.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Good luck, chief.
Sir, your prisoner's right there.
Now look here, Officer, we'll fight this case in every law court in the country.
- Hello, Steven.
- Hello, sir.
- Who are these men?
- Mervin, the town marshal... and Mr. Candless. Meet my father.
See, Father, we thought I was going to be arrested for that trouble back home.
No, I paid the company the money your foolishness lost.
I guess it was mostly my fault.
I shouldn't have tried to force you into being a businessman.
Well, Steven, aren't you going to introduce me to the young lady... whose waist your arm is around?
- Sir, this is Lettie Candless.
- How do you do, Lettie?
Don't bother remembering her last name, she's gonna change that right away.
A crowded wharf is hardly the place to get acquainted... with a prospective daughter-in-law.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Come on, let's go!
Did you have a nice trip?
- Have a cigar.
- Thank you.
"Made especially for C. V. Atterbury."
Well, you know, that's a very funny thing... that you should have the same name as C.V. Atterbury... that owns all those railroads and steamships...
- and mines and banks.
- What's funny about that?
- You mean you are the...
- Let me assist you, Mr. Candless.
- No. Let me assist you, Mr. Atterbury.
- Thank you.
All right, make your bets before the wheel stops rolling, men.
Make your bet.
Pick your lucky number.
A toast! I want to propose a toast to Mr. Atterbury, my father-in-law to be.
And to Pop Candless, my father-in-law to be.
If you'll excuse me,
I must change for my number.
- And the name of that number is?
- The Ballad of Milicent Devere.
Ballad of Milicent Devere.
Sounds like something from Robert Service.
Mr. Atterbury, you're in for a surprise.
Viola, will you bring my things?
- I won't be a moment.
- A single moment will seem forever.
Spoken like a true knight of the round table.
Pardon me, Mr. Atterbury. I have to run down to the bank, but I'll be right back.
Pop, Sam. Excuse us, folks.
Imagine not knowing Steve had a sister.
Why there's seven of us children all told.
And father had four brothers and two sisters.
So you can see we've got a very bright future.
Anyhow, a busy one.
Hello, George, I got your message.
What's up?
Just want to talk to you about a few things.
- Double-cross, huh?
- Sort of.
The Alaskan Star sails tonight instead of tomorrow night.
That must have cost you something.
It did. But it'll show a neat profit.
Less people get a cut.
Come on, start moving.
Make a bad move anytime you want, gentlemen.
Miss De Valle. They walked out on us.
- Where do you think they've gone?
- That Mr. Jack, he's so industrious.
- He's gone to the bank.
- What?
I love hard working men, they come in so handy on the first of the month.
What a first class sucker I've been.
To think I believed that fellow.
All right girls, make your changes for the next number.
- Hold everything!
- Hold everything? You can't do that... the show must go on, you know.
- Why?
- I don't know.
To think I've got my own money in that bank.
- Anything wrong with the bank?
- The bank? What about the bank?
- I'm not saying it's unsteady or anything...
- I got money in there.
Your money will be safe. Probably.
"Probably" won't help me buy a chicken farm to retire on.
Kids, wait a minute, kids.
There's nothing to worry about.
If you draw your money out tonight.
What are we waiting for? Come on, let's go.
You can start down to the boat with that stuff.
I'll take care of locking up our ex-partners and catch up with you later.
All right.
But first, there's two things I gotta do.
What would you do if a fella did this to you?
- Well, l...
- That's one of them.
What's the other?
This.
Ain't no use to look on the boat for me.
I don't like boats. They make me seasick.
You thought I was dumb, didn't you?
Stay where you are.
You weren't a bit ruffled when Mervin walked out of here... with that gold dust, were you?
You know, sometimes I'm so smart
I surprise myself.
I knew exactly what Mervin was gonna do.
You were smart enough to sneak back to this window and take a peek.
That's just what I did. Open it up.
All right, everybody get in that closet.
Mervin's gonna be awfully mad when he finds... he's carried all that sand 1,000 miles.
- Looks like this kind of upsets things.
- Yeah, I know.
Just like Papa always said:
"If you lay down with hound dogs, you gonna get up with fleas."
- You kind of had some ideas yourself.
- What do you mean?
I know all about those horses you had staked out between here and Fairbanks.
Well, Grandpa used to tell me if a fella don't look out for himself, nobody else will.
Well, it looks like I'm in with nothing but a bunch of crooks!
- How do you know this here bank ain't safe?
- I'm positive it isn't.
Miss De Valle is Mr. Calhoun's sweetheart and she's worried about her money in there.
That's good enough for me.
I got 400 ounces of dust in there... and if I don't get it, he gets this!
Heap much trouble, Mr. Calhoun.
Many people come, they got ropes.
Hang everybody.
- Chief, go guard the front door.
- All right.
What are we gonna do?
You should have stayed away from here, there's a run on the bank.
- I know, I sent them.
- You sent them?
Of course,
I spread the rumor the bank wasn't safe.
You'd be surprised how quickly people believe a story like that.
Listen to them.
You ought to marry some honest fella and help him get along in the world.
That's not a bad idea.
We haven't got any money to pay off.
Mervin stole the sand because he thought it was gold and George stole the gold.
Suppose you go out there and try to bluff them with conversation.
That's your specialty. But I'll try.
It's been so nice knowing you,
Miss De Valle.
Let's all be quiet, please! Quiet!
Folks, your money is inside and is absolutely safe.
You're the only one that thinks so.
All this trouble has been caused by some malicious rumors.
We don't want any unsatisfied depositors.
Anybody...
Give us our money, we'll be satisfied.
Well, the bank opens at 9:00 in the morning.
- I want my dust right now!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!
All right. The bank will open in a moment.
Take care of the keys, chief.
Are you crazy?
How are you gonna pay them?
Mama told me if I didn't go to Sunday school I'd wind up at the end of a rope.
We can't all hide in there.
Come on, give me a hand.
- I'm confused.
- Come on, get busy.
Pop, you take that set of scales,
Sam, you take that set.
I'd like to see the expression on George's face... when he opens up them sacks and finds out he's got sand, too.
- All right, chief. Open up, let them in.
- All right.
Quiet, folks. Form a line at each window.
Now don't crowd.
All your gold's safe, you'll get it.
I can see that I've always underestimated you.
Resourceful would be a good one-word description of you.
Thank you.
I can think of another word but I won't use it, being a lady.
Cover that.
- Here's some greenbacks.
- Calhoun.
- Atterbury wants to see you.
- Yes?
Hello, Mr. Calhoun.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
- Why, certainly. Step right in.
- Thank you.
- Miss De Valle.
- Good evening.
My boy, a situation like this can be disastrous.
So I've heard.
But I have no intention of leaving a man like yourself... in such a predicament.
There's no need to worry.
We're all right, the money's all here.
Mr. Calhoun, I pride myself on one thing:
My judgment of character.
When I first laid eyes on you
I said to myself:
"There's a fine, honest, dependable man."
I hope you're not injured, Miss De Valle.
Although I quite realize all this excitement would cause a lady to faint.
It was the shock. I'm all right now.
I should like, sir, to have you accept these drafts on San Francisco... for deposit in the amount of $100,000.
Mr. Atterbury.
Really, I couldn't, Mr. Atterbury...
I couldn't think...
Step in here, Mr. Atterbury.
Mr. Candless, a passbook, please.
- C.V. Atterbury?
- Correct.
- Shall I use your Seattle address?
- Yes.
C.V. Atterbury just deposited $100,000.
- What?
- What did you say?
- C.V. Atterbury just deposited $100,000.
- He did? C.V. Atterbury?
I saw him with my own eyes.
I don't know where to put this where it's gonna be safe.
I'm gonna put mine back in the bank.
Me, too.
Mr. Atterbury, would you please take off your hat?
Thank you. I've always wanted to see a halo.
You should look in your mirror,
Miss De Valle.
Mr. Atterbury.
I wish you fellas would make up your mind.
One minute you take it out, the next minute you put it in.
All right, next, who's next? Come on.
Please, Mr. Candless, may I have back my book?
I don't want to be robbed in the middle of the night.
Viola Chase.
You know, Viola...
"yes," would make it Mrs. Candless.
I won't say yes. I'll say maybe.
May I?
Now that you want to be a banker's wife, a little less flash.
You know, a little more conservative in public.
- And in private?
- Be your own calm, sweet self.
I know exactly what you mean.
Hold me tight, Alec.
I'm frightened.
There's nothing to be afraid of, darling.
We're together from here on in.
We're not.
That's what frightens me.
Alec, will you write to me often?
What do you think?
I think that I love you very much.
I want to tell you and tell you and tell you.
Ahem.
Sorry, mates.
It's time to say so long.
Right, skipper.
See you soon.
See you soon.
Oh, it's not fair, uncle Thad.
Only two hours together.
I didn't say any of the things I wanted to, and now Alec's gone.
If only we didn't have to sail tonight.
I'm sorry, Nancy.
It's orders.
You know, this is the first time
I ever saw him in his uniform.
Well, the war hasn't changed him any.
Same old grin.
Yeah.
The same old grin.
Nothing will ever change that.
He had it even when he first proposed to me when I was 5 years old.
Oh, look. They're warming up a plane.
Maybe it's Alec's.
His mission tonight is up past bougainville.
Ah, he's a fine lad, Nancy.
Course, I take a lot of credit for it.
Credit?
It's surprising he turned out halfway civilized, those wild sea stories you were always telling him when he was a little kid.
But they were all true, even the ones I told when I had too much of what Alec called my scotch friends.
Oh, by golly, I'm losing my grip.
I should have married you two.
I could, you know.
I'm a captain.
Oh, you're sweet, uncle Thad.
Oh, I'm not thinking of you, but I'd like to see the faces on the folks back home when they heard an old pirate like me stood in for a preacher.
Oh, you're an old rascal, but I love you.
Excuse me.
Casualties coming aboard, sir.
Very well.
I'd better get back on duty.
Tower. Tower.
Tower!
Give me the emergency power on the port engine.
Yes, sir.
Cady!
It's got to be this time or never.
Radio the base.
We're making a landing.
Cut the gas!
See what you can do for the crew and check the hull.
Nothing here the pumps won't handle.
We'll float alright.
The crew... how bad are they?
It's no use.
You mean all of them?
How bad is the radio?
Voice transmitter's gone.
Receiver's okay.
Don't they know where we're down?
Didn't the kid get a message off?
Radioed the attack.
Didn't have a chance to send back our position.
Do you know any of the burial service?
Yeah. I guess I know a couple of lines.
Say them.
The lord hath given.
The lord hath taken away.
Blessed be the name of the lord.
So long, you guys.
Whoo!
Oh, it's going to be a scorcher today.
Better start getting used to that heat.
Alec.
Alec! There's a bullet hole in it!
Yeah, I know.
The other breakers are shot up, too.
What?
I saved what water
I could... In this.
Are you kidding?
Why, even if we use an eyedropper, that won't last more than a couple of days.
We've got to make it last...
Till something happens.
Till what happens?
We're off our course.
Oh, we'll be spotted
Alec, what do you really think of our chances?
I think we've got a very good chance.
What do you think?
I think you're trying to keep up our morale.
Hello, you yanks. How's everything?
This is your friend from Tokyo.
Don't you think you've done your duty yet?
Everyone on our team thinks you have.
Just think how anxious the folks are to see you back home.
Do me a favor, will you?
Go down there and cut rose's throat.
...mom and pop.
And how big do you suppose that kid sister is now?
And what about that girl?
Don't leave her alone...
Too long.
They're still trying to get us.
There's our signal again.
They're beginning to worry now.
Any message?
Yeah... come home, boys.
All is forgiven.
Sorry, fellas.
We can't accept your invitation.
We've been disconnected.
Disconnected from the whole world...
From everything...
From everybody you love.
Alec.
Alec!
Nancy, what's the matter?
Something's happened to Alec.
Uncle Thad, something's happened to Alec.
He's in trouble or hurt.
I know it.
No. Now, Nancy.
Maybe... maybe his plane was shot down.
Nonsense. You've been dreaming or something.
No. I can always tell when Alec's in trouble.
Even when we were little kids, it was like that.
I feel it.
I'm sure.
Now, look here.
You've been working too hard.
Too many sick boys on this ship.
No. It's just as if
Alec was telling me.
It's always been like that.
Once, I went all the way home from Honolulu because I knew something was happening to him.
Oh, uncle Thad,
I've got to go to him.
I've got to.
He needs me.
You sit down and let me get you a cup of coffee.
But we're not too far off his course.
Maybe... we've got to try to find him.
Here, now. You drink this down quick.
Uncle Thad, you've got to listen.
I'm asking you this with everything that's inside of me.
Take me to Alec.
You can do it.
I love you, Nancy, and I love Alec, but I can't take the ship off its course, not for anybody.
If it's going to make you feel any better,
I'll try and get in touch with his base and get some news of him.
Oh, I'm so sure he needs us.
I'm so sure of it.
Joe, did you ever think about somebody so hard you could almost actually see them?
Nope. When I see them, they're there.
I can see somebody right now.
Oh. A dame?
She's beautiful.
A girl named Nancy.
Yeah? Where did you pick her up?
A little town in Iowa...
When I was about 7.
You had your mind on dames even then, huh?
Maybe I should have lived in a small town.
Oh, you sure would have liked it, Joe.
Westview was the nicest little town you ever saw... big old maple trees all around the courthouse square...
And Bailey's drugstore.
Ah, there's something about your own hometown.
My hometown had 7 million people.
I can remember the summer heat hanging over the corn... corn taller than a man can reach with a buggy whip.
Ah, you cornfed guys are all alike.
Soon as the sun goes down, you get homesick.
Well, maybe it's because I've got so much to look back on.
You know, I've lived in this little town all my life, and somehow or other,
I can't feel cut off from it even now.
Alec, voice-over: One of the first things
I can remember is our old model "T."
My father was the town doctor, and sometimes he'd take me with him on his rounds.
Daddy, what road is this?
The old west road, son.
Where does this old west road go?
Goes on and on...
Due west.
How far is due west?
Way out past the county hospital.
Is the county hospital the end of the world?
Sometimes it is, son.
I'll be a doctor and go to the county hospital way at the end of the world out the old west road.
When, daddy, when?
When you grow up, take dad's place.
Alec, voice-over:
Our house was the one with the cupola on main street.
It was large and square and roomy.
Dad's office was to the right as you went up the steps, and to the left was the living room where mother had her piano.
My mother could have been a professional pianist.
Or is that how every kid thinks about a thing his mother does?
My mother was beautiful then, and any room she happened to be in, people felt good just to be there.
What's that, mother?
What's that?
The music?
That one. That one.
Uh, that one?
Yes.
That's the g note.
G note?
Mm-hmm. Here, honey.
You make it.
Oh, that's the g note.
It goes and goes.
It goes?
Away down the road far.
What road, Alec?
The old west road, mother.
That's the g note road.
It goes all the way.
I think it's time for you to wash your hands for dinner, darling.
Gosh, I don't mind dirty hands.
Why does everybody else care so much?
I like that g note, mother.
It goes and goes and goes.
Alec, voice-over: Then, of course, there was Nancy...
Nancy Fraser, who lived across the street from us.
She was always right behind me in everything I did.
Every year, Nancy and I went hunting for lady-slippers in the woods below the water tower.
Alec.
What?
Aw!
I didn't find it,
Alec. I didn't.
I only said Alec and pointed.
Aw, who wants an old flower?
Even a girl can find an old flower.
Why,
I bet you I can climb that water tower.
Why, I guess you can climb anything in this world!
Alright, if you don't believe me, watch!
Wahoo!
Wahoo, Nancy!
Wahoo!
Wahoo!
Wahoo!
Look at Alec up there.
Whoa.
Hey!
Hey, come on down here.
Come on, come on.
Come on down here.
You darn fool kid!
I'm going to get your father!
Wahoo!
Wahoo!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Here I come, Alec.
Well... Well, come on.
I... Don't think I can.
I'm getting tired.
Go back down, then.
I... Alec...
I think I'm going to let go.
Aw, just an old girl, that's all you are.
Just an old girl!
I'm not! I'm not just an old girl.
I'm not... I'm not...
I'm not!
I'm not just an old girl.
I'm not.
You shouldn't be up here.
My, we're up high.
It's nice up here, isn't it?
No.
Alec! Are you up there,
Alec Brooke?
It's your father.
Yes, Mr. Fraser.
Hello, daddy!
Get away from the edge!
I'm coming right up.
Hold on to her... tight!
Alec, so help me, if you let go of her for one minute, I'll...
Never mind.
Just hold on to her.
It's beautiful up here.
Just be quiet.
Be...
Quiet.
Don't look down, daddy.
What?
Take it easy, Fraser!
We'll be right with you!
Alec, voice-over: I thought I'd be punished good and proper for that stunt, but when I got home, I found that uncle Thad was going off to sea again, and mother knew that that was punishment enough.
My uncle Thad's a wonderful guy.
He's in the regular Navy now, but in those days, he was as colorful and romantic as an old buccaneer.
His head was full of the darnedest stories.
Do you have to go, uncle Thad?
Aye, aye.
Back to the pacific.
Oh, it's a dreadful fate.
Well, if you don't want to go, why are you going?
Did you hear that?
I'm deaf, uncle Thad.
I can't hear anything.
My ears are ringing.
So are mine.
What is it, boy, that makes a man go on and on, huh?
Keep moving, living, hoping?
What is it, boy?
A ringing in the ears, the sight of something you saw once and you live to see again, a dream inside you.
Every man's got one, and I got mine:
To find High Barbaree.
What's that?
High Barbaree?
The island I saw once... oh, didn't I tell you?
Where?
Out in the pacific ocean.
Oh, I know, some folks say there is no such place, and it's not on the charts.
But just the same, I saw it.
High Barbaree?
Yep. Rising high, high up out of the ocean... two great mountains with a long, white beach betwixt them, flowers and palm trees and...
Yep, I saw it, and I'll see it again someday.
Uncle Thad, were there any bears and tigers on it?
Well, now, as a matter of fact,
I didn't get on the island.
There was a storm... the worst storm I ever lived through.
There I was standing watch, and then I heard the gong.
The what?
The gong.
There's an old native chief lives on the island.
His name is Tangaroa.
Looks something like that chap there.
The first thing you hear when you come near high Barbaree is Tangaroa banging the gong... a gong, ooh, a million times bigger than that one.
I've known that island ever since
I was no bigger than you are.
My grandfather saw it once, and he heard the gong on the very same spot... the time he was caught in the typhoon.
Yes, sir, and when I saw it, it was just like he said.
There she was, rising up out of the mist... High Barbaree.
I wanted to head for it.
I told the captain, but he said I'd been visiting my scotch friends.
He ordered me below, and when he let me on deck again, it was gone.
So I lost my chance to get ashore.
But I will...
Someday, boy.
Do you know where to find it again?
Of course I do.
One north by 160 east.
Well, here, look.
I'll show it to you on the chart.
Now, let's see...
Solomon Islands,
Guadalcanal, bougainville.
Right there.
Yes, sir!
Right there!
Here's a pencil.
Mark it on the chart, boy.
Mark it on the chart and make it official.
High Barbaree.
High barbaree.
And I never stopped thinking about that island.
And whenever uncle Thad came back to westview, he and Nancy and I would always talk about it.
How can you keep your mind on an island dreamed up by a drunken old uncle?
Look. That's all
I can think about.
You want to finish it off now?
I've got to.
I can't stand it.
Well, that's that.
Alec.
Yeah.
Where did you say that fool island was?
One north, 160 east.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Alec, look here.
Hmm?
Here's the position you just gave me, and here's our drift so far.
Why, it's like we laid a course for it!
Yeah, that's right.
We're drifting right towards it.
Can't be much more than
100 miles from here.
This don't make sense.
Why doesn't it?
I've been haunted by high
Barbaree all my life, and here we are within just a few miles of it.
That's not just an accident.
I even named this plane
High Barbaree, didn't I?
And that's where it's trying to take us.
Come on.
Let's help it.
Help it? How?
We'll rig up the sails with the parachutes.
What are we waiting for?
I might have known I could depend on uncle Thad.
He promised me I'd get to High Barbaree.
He never broke a promise yet.
Never left the house without telling me he was going to bring me something.
He always kept his word.
On my 11th birthday, it was a canoe.
Nancy and I were up at the crack of dawn down at the railroad station, waiting.
Suppose uncle Thad doesn't come, Alec.
You don't know my uncle Thad, Nancy.
But anybody could forget since last year... even to buy a canoe.
Your mother said so, Alec.
Mother doesn't know uncle Thad, either.
Oh! You scared me out of 7 years' growth!
It's his birthday, Mrs. Henshaw.
Alec!
Wahoo!
Wahoo!
What's the matter with him? Is he crazy?
Why, no.
He's just happy.
Wahoo!
Alec, the train's coming!
Come down... quick!
Wahoo!
Wahoo!
Come on!
Board!
Mister, where is the canoe?
Stand aside, son.
Don't bother us.
But where is the canoe?
Now get back.
There's no canoe here.
Stand aside. You'll... you'll get hurt.
Oh, Alec.
I have a birthday present for you.
I made it myself.
A nice orange necktie.
I dropped several stitches, but if you tie it just a certain way... thanks a lot, Nancy.
Why, somebody must be moving.
Belay there!
You want to chip the paint off her?
Lower her on the lawn.
Easy away.
Easy does it.
My canoe!
It's battleship gray!
Uncle Thad!
Been keeping your weather eye out for squalls, Alec?
Aw, uncle Thad!
Hey!
Easy with that.
Gosh all mighty!
Gurgle gurgle!
Shh!
Well, Thad!
Thad Vail!
Oh, you've gotten thin.
You always say that.
I ain't took off a ounce since my last voyage.
And your grammar hasn't improved a bit.
Well, I guess it ain't.
Alec thinks you're a great man.
Are you, Thad?
Who me? Sure, in places.
When you want to pick her up, you catch her this-a-way, and up she goes!
Out of my way, little girl.
Well!
Well, Thad!
Hiya, doctor.
By golly, it's good to see you.
Thanks. Could you tell me... why didn't you let us know you were coming?
Thaddy Vail!
Hello, Delly.
I heard you were in town.
I mean,
I just happened to be passing.
I'm glad I came about so prompt.
Oh, Thaddy, you haven't changed a bit.
Tell me, have I?
No, Delly. I can't say you have.
Where do I stow this?
Uncle Thad, why don't we stow her on dad's car, and then go to the river?
That's a good idea.
You sure know a lot about boats.
Yeah, but when I'm ashore,
I'm just a poor flopping fish, always getting into trouble.
What do you mean?
Well, in this port, is that there Delly Parkson.
I get a sort of crawly feeling, like she was fixing to throw her hooks into me, matrimoniously speaking.
Gosh! That's terrible.
Can I do anything, uncle Thad?
You'll make a sailor yet. Yes, sir.
When you see that female getting me so I don't know wind from water, you look at me like, uh...
Like there was a shark around, and say something that nobody but us can understand.
Uh-huh. Avast. Ease off.
Man overboard.
Avast. Ease off.
Man overboard.
Look, uncle Thad!
A muskrat!
I'll get him.
Alec, watch out!
Well, that will show you more than I can ever teach you.
It don't pay to stand up in a canoe.
I'll remember.
Why, Alec, you can swim!
Sure, I can.
Ha! Think of that.
You know me.
I never did pick up the hang of it.
But why ain't you drownded?
Standing on bottom.
Alec, voice-over:
That was a wonderful summer.
Nancy stayed with us while her parents went to Montana, and there was uncle Thad and my canoe and my doctor's office.
Oh, yeah. I had a little doctor's office of my own rigged up in the old toolshed.
Sometimes I had as many as 5 patients.
Come in.
Any visitors allowed, doc?
Help me a minute, will you, Nancy, while I finish this bandage?
I never had such a darn wiggly patient.
I thought he only got a Thorn in his foot.
Why do you need a splint?
I decided a splint was necessary.
Okey-doke, doc.
Know something?
What?
You're going to be a doctor when you grow up, aren't you?
Sure. You know that.
And I'm going to be a nurse...
Dr. Alec Brooke's nurse.
There now.
We'd better go in, Alec.
Your mother said dinner's ready.
That's the best-tasting beef
I've had since I don't remember.
Della raised that beef on her own farm,
Thad.
You don't say?
The cob corn, too.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if she didn't make the biscuits, also.
That's right.
Well, now, that's amazing.
A half-hour in the house, Delly, and you whip up a wonderful meal like this.
Mmm, and your elderberry wine...
They always put bait on hooks.
What?
Just a little shaving more before we clear off?
No, Delly. I'm loaded to the gunwales.
Oh, now, that's a pity.
What's the pity of it, Marthy?
Well, peach shortcake.
Yeah. Della's peach shortcake.
Will you serve it, Della?
Uh-huh.
Peach. Well, if there's one thing I'm partial to, it's peach shortcake.
I remembered.
Did you?
Mm-hmm.
You're wonderful, Delly.
Think of you running that whole big barn by yourself.
A woman by herself has to do for herself, but sometimes I think it ain't nature.
A woman...
Well, she's timid.
Handling the stock, bossing them big, coarse hired men, making out income taxes till my head fairly whizzes.
Aw, you poor little girl.
What you need on that place,
Della, is a man.
Oh, gosh!
Where would she find the man good enough for her?
A big, strapping fellow who'd put his foot down and give out orders deep-sea fashion.
But who, Thaddy?
Uh, oh, somebody for instance like...
Like...
Man overboard!
Alec!
Man overboard!
Alec, what is the matter with you?
I was just reminding uncle
Thad of something, mother.
Remember, uncle Thad?
Oh, sure, sure.
I...
That's a private signal we have. I...
I promised to show him my sea charts.
That was the best trip I ever made.
Covered 27,000 miles of ocean, touched pretty near
1,000 little islands.
Did you see High Barbaree?
No, no.
But I was within 600 miles of it once.
Right there...
Gilbert islands.
And here's High Barbaree.
See where we marked her?
That's right.
Keep your eye on her, boy, and I bet you I find her the next time.
You bet you will.
Uncle Thad?
You think your scotch friends are going to mix with that elderberry wine?
Why not?
They're both good.
Thad, Della's waiting for you to see her home, help carry her dishes and things.
Good, good, good.
Alright, Marthy.
Uncle Thad!
Shh!
Don't you worry.
Don't you worry, boy.
I'm in top form now.
I can handle that Della Parkson, alright, alright.
Alec, wake up.
Alec, wake up!
What?
Shh!
I'm being pursued.
We got to clear out.
Clear out?
Mm-hmm. Shh!
It's that Delly Parkson.
She's after me.
We're going downriver.
What?!
Yup, straight to the Mississippi.
After that, there's nothing to stop us this side of the Gulf of Mexico.
Where are my pants?
Whew!
I pretty near made a fool of myself.
That dang moonlight.
It took 15 years and 30 pounds off Delly right before my very eyes, and the next thing I knew, she was talking about getting married.
What did you do to her?
I practically didn't do anything important, and I'm not going to get married just for that.
You're absolutely right.
Hurry up. Hurry up, Alec.
Got all our stores.
Raided the icebox.
Can we take Nancy with us?
A woman?
I'd sooner have a bulldog on shipboard.
Nancy isn't exactly a woman.
She will be.
You mark my word for it.
Come on, Alec, now.
Hurry. Hurry up.
I'm ready.
My toothbrush.
Shh!
Uncle Thad?
I couldn't go without Nancy.
I promised her that tomorrow we'd... dang me, Alec!
You'll never make a sailor.
But, uncle Thad, you said when I promised...
Alright, alright.
Go get her if you promised anything.
But you're not too young to go easy on the promises you make to women.
Nancy. Nancy!
Oh, sling a rock in at her.
Nancy!
Alec! What are you doing?
We're going to sail to the Gulf of Mexico.
Wait for me.
Nancy, get your clothes on.
All that time, that female could be creeping up on me.
Know something, uncle Thad?
When I woke up this morning,
I was dreaming.
I was admiral of a ship with a white silk sail.
Was I in there?
Sure. You hollered "land ho!"
When we sighted the island.
It was High Barbaree.
It had two volcanos with a Cliff between them, like in yardley.
There was a surf and seabirds.
That was her, right enough.
I'm going there someday.
I don't mean just when I'm asleep.
I mean really.
You mean we'll really go?
Why, we're on our way there right now.
I thought we were going to the Gulf of Mexico.
Oh, no.
That's just a one-night port.
After that, High Barbaree.
Oh, boy!
Foul weather ahead, mates.
Look to your mainsail, bosun.
Aye, aye, sir.
We made port alright and headed right into foul weather of another kind.
Uncle Thad met up with some of his scotch friends and got separated from Nancy and me.
It was morning before we caught up with him.
You got to get that hotel manager to lend you a dollar.
Then wire your dad and tell him what a pickle we're in.
Well... Alright.
We'll tend to everything, uncle Thad.
You just stay right here.
I'm not going to send any telegram.
They'd come and get us.
I'm going to find a job.
Then I can make $10 to pay the judge.
Oh, that's a swell idea!
I'll work hard, mister.
No, no.
I told you I don't need no help.
I'm awfully strong.
Run away, little boy, and don't bother me.
Alec! Alec!
I've got a job for you.
What is it?
You get $10, and we get uncle Thad out.
What is it? Where?
What do I do?
You ride a bicycle.
Just ride a bicycle.
$10 just to ride a bicycle?
Come on!
Good boy!
Good boy!
Hold it a little longer, Alec.
Alright.
That sure is right.
Boy!
Everything is easy with a bike like this.
See? I told you, mister.
You can do it!
You can do it!
You certainly know how to handle that bike.
Well, I guess I can do anything anybody else can.
Sam, go get bernadino's clothes.
Yes, sir.
And fix up a couple of plates of stew for the kids.
Yes, sir.
Well, fella, you've crashed the circus.
What happened to him?
Oh, um...
He just had a little accident.
You understand,
Alec gets $10 for doing this.
You made the deal.
Sam, see that he's dressed by 9:00.
Your act goes on at 9:23.
Step over this way, son.
There's the shoot.
Take a gander at it.
It...
It's High, isn't it?
You can do it, Alec.
You can do it.
Sure you can.
Sure... I... Can.
Thank goodness for that fool umbrella.
It was easy to trace.
You're just a great big kid, Thad.
Well, you know how it is, doc.
Yes, yes.
I know, I know, but you're going to have a tough time explaining to Martha.
She, uh... Sent your duds along, Thad.
She did, eh?
Well, I guess maybe
I did overstay my welcome.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
A bicycle act.
Now, if Alec's anywhere, it'll be here.
Yeah, that's right.
Let's take a look.
Come in and see the most sensational daredevil of the century, the great bernadino, in his gravity-defying death leap.
There he goes!
Hurry, hurry, hurry, folks!
We may as well sit down till this is over.
Alright, bernadino.
Hop aboard.
Hold on tight.
My!
It's a lot higher looking down.
You ain't scared, is you, boy?
No.
Wahoo!
Wahoo!
Wahoo!
Boy, you'd better get ready.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am proud to present the most spectacular, the most colossal feat ever performed by man.
You know something?
Most of those guys break their necks sooner or later.
Yeah.
...the world-renowned daredevil, the great bernadino!
Are you ready, captain?
Wave your arms, boy.
Here goes the big boom.
Alec, you did it, you did it!
Nancy!
You were wonderful!
Was I?
Alec!
Uncle Thad!
Alec, are you alright?
Dad!
We were just coming to get you out of jail.
Break it up, break it up.
What's the idea?
Excuse me.
Did you hire that boy to do that?
Why, yes. I... oh, you did, eh?
Oh, now, wait a minute, mister.
Wait. I can explain.
Hey, uncle Thad, wait till I take Nancy out of here.
Hey! Well, here's my bus.
Be good, kids.
Bernadino, don't you ride off any cliffs.
Doc.
So long, Thad.
Uncle Thad!
Don't go away.
Please don't.
Well, it was a fine voyage while it lasted.
Come home with us, please.
Your mother doesn't think my scotch friends are good enough company for you and Nancy.
I don't mind, uncle Thad.
Really I don't.
Take good care of her, Alec.
Yes, uncle Thad.
Be seeing you, mates.
Alec, voice-over: Dad was very kind and understanding on the way home.
He knew how much we were going to miss uncle Thad.
But finally he had to tell us that Nancy and I were going to be separated, too.
Her family was moving to Montana.
My world had suddenly collapsed.
Now, remember,
I expect to hear from you every week.
You will.
Good-bye, Martha.
Bye, bill.
Good-bye. Don't forget you've got to keep an eye on this fella!
Hey, I'm the one that's got to keep an eye on her!
Alec, look out.
Get back there. Get!
Good-bye, Nancy.
Won't I ever see you again?
Sure, Nancy.
I told you, someday we're going to
High Barbaree together.
Yes, Alec, we will.
We will. High Barbaree.
Alec, voice-over:
I guess my heart pretty nearly broke that day.
Nancy was so completely a part of my life, and our dream of going to High
Barbaree seemed a long way off.
Well, brother, it's still a long way off.
Take a look at that calm.
Not a ripple.
We break our backs putting up sails, sweat the last drop of moisture out of our hides, and we don't move.
We're not even drifting anyplace now.
Ah, we'll be alright.
Something will happen.
Yeah, and I know what.
We'll be food for whales.
That's what'll happen.
No. I'd rather go over the side now, get it done with.
Take it easy, Joe.
We'll get a breeze.
When? If you've got a breeze up your sleeve, I want it now, while I'm alive and can feel it.
Go on, miracle man... dream up a wind that'll blow this crate to your High Barbaree, or sink the thing quick.
What was that?
It's the wind!
It's a breeze!
Alright, Joe, tighten the sails!
That's a deal!
One sail tightener, coming up. Ha ha!
Captain, my captain, here we go.
Boy, are we moving.
Look at that wake!
You know, Brooke, if this holds out, we'll be sighting that dream island tomorrow.
See?
I told you you'd get me believing in it.
Oh, you're going to see a beautiful place, boy.
Palm trees and flowers everywhere... and fresh water.
Fresh water?
Oh, boy!
The way I used to see it, there was a guy named
Tangaroa who'd meet me there.
He'd grin and laugh and start leading me to my native house.
Nice old guy.
Always seemed to be kind of tickled about some secret I wasn't in on.
You mean to tell me you can remember a dream you dreamed once a long time ago?
Once? When I was a kid,
I used to dream it over and over again.
Having a repeater dream like that, doesn't that mean you're nuts?
Could be.
There's a funny thing about that dream, though.
It was clear up to a point, and then everything would get mixed up.
There'd be the lady-slippers, just like in the woods at home, and the path I was on would turn into the old g note road.
Then I used to hurry faster because I had the idea someone was waiting for me.
Nancy?
I don't know. That part of the dream always kind of faded out.
Anyway, as I grew older,
I stopped having the dream at all.
Matter of fact,
I forgot about Nancy, too.
But didn't you ever wonder what sort of a woman she turned out to be?
Oh,
I had a lot of other things on my mind.
After two years at Harvard med. , I gave up the idea of being a doctor and went in for aviation.
Boy, what a smart guy.
Some switch.
Well, I'd met Diana Case.
Her father owned the new aircraft plan in westview.
I get it.
Ha ha!
Oh, I got to be one of those slick, know-it-all executives, regular big shot...
I thought.
It's hard to believe you made that takeoff you claim, lifted her like that, with a full gas load.
We sure did.
You're in for a surprise when we test her tomorrow, colonel.
It's my job to find fault, case.
This canopy bothers me.
Can you give us a little more visibility?
We think so.
We're trying for more all the time.
I'm having a meeting with our engineers this afternoon.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Miss Case is calling for her father.
Alright.
Diana's here to pick you up, sir.
Couldn't wait for tonight.
Calls for me to get an extra look at him.
Alright.
Come along, colonel.
First thing I know, she'll be calling for him, and I suppose I'll have to walk home.
Yeah.
Your mother is on the wire, Mr. Brooke.
Fine. Put her on.
Then send Boyd and Jones in.
Yes, mother.
Nancy who?
Nancy Fraser?
No, I can't possibly pick her up.
I've got to see a couple of guys about a lot of visibility.
I'm sorry, mom.
Bye-bye.
Mom, why aren't you dressed?
We'll be late for the party.
It's been such an exciting day... so many nice surprises.
Your father finally agreed to wear his dinner jacket.
Oh, and I just called Mrs. case.
She said by all means to bring Nancy.
Now, what are we going to do at a party with that kid?
Well, maybe even a kid might like a party.
I have it. Why don't you send out for one of those sitters?
Ha ha ha!
Hello, Alec.
Hello.
Nancy?
Oh, I'd have known you anywhere.
Same red hair, same freckles... very nice, too.
Well, I'll be darned.
Hey, you're big!
Oh, not so very, but I see what you mean.
It's been a long time.
Well, what do you know?
Braces gone and those funny pigtails.
What did you do to your hair?
And your legs!
I turned them in.
Get a new model every year.
Ha ha!
Well, for my money, you can keep this year's job.
Well, thank you, sir.
That's very encouraging.
Well, well.
Isn't anybody but me going to this party?
You know, it'll take us an hour to drive into the city.
I guess I better get dressed.
Well, what do you know?
You girls better step on it, too.
Alright.
Come along, dear.
Nancy, put on your very best duds.
Lots of competition tonight.
Big-city folks, this Case family.
Tuxedos in the summertime.
I hope they don't mind mothballs.
Ohh...
Happy?
Mm-hmm. You?
Couldn't be happier.
I like redheads.
Oh, you brave girl.
Sorry, boys, but the next dance is mine.
She is very attractive, isn't she?
I guess so, if you like that type.
Which you don't.
Oh, you're so right.
The tall, slinky type...
That's for me.
How did you happen to ask her for this weekend?
Oh, stop kidding.
I told you,
I haven't seen Nancy for over 10 years.
10 years can make a lot of difference.
Oh, sure.
She was a kid then.
Today, she's...
She's a woman.
I thought you'd noticed that.
Oh, stop it.
Ha ha ha!
Excuse me, Alec.
May I break up this happy couple, just for one dance?
Of course, colonel.
I promise to return her safe and sound.
Mind if I take your girl, dad?
I certainly do.
Sorry, pop.
Very poor choice, young lady.
Women are like that.
No judgment.
Well, why bother with it?
When you have a new hairdo and new legs and... and can dance like a breeze.
Yes. Ha ha ha!
Sorry, doc.
Doc.
Oh, that sure takes me back.
Yes. It takes me back, too.
Well, what have you been doing all these years?
Plenty.
No. No kidding.
I want to know all about you.
Well, to begin with,
I'm a Navy nurse.
A Navy nurse?
I don't believe it.
No, honestly.
I've been at Pearl harbor for a year.
I'm on my way back now.
Well, what do you know?
You always said you were going to be a nurse.
Dr. Alec Brooke's nurse.
Kids say the darnedest things.
So you actually did what you planned.
I never thought of doing anything else.
Nancy, how did you happen to come back here just now?
You've never been in Honolulu?
Uh-uh.
Out there, they've got a place called diamond head.
It rises right out on the pacific, against the sky.
First time I saw it, I...
I thought it was High Barbaree.
High Barbaree?
Every time I looked up at it,
I thought of uncle Thad and...
And the rest of the brookes.
Well, one night I was out sailing with an awfully nice Navy man, a lieutenant Miller.
He asked me to marry him, and it was a beautiful night.
I looked up at High Barbaree...
I mean diamond head, and suddenly I had a feeling.
I wanted to see westview again, and so I...
I told him I'd give him my answer when I came back.
And have you made up your mind?
Yes.
Well, go on.
What are you going to tell him?
Would you really like to know?
Of course.
May I?
After all, Brooke, we can't let you have all the beautiful girls.
Look toward your future, darling, not your past.
Alec.
What?
I just told dad he could announce it.
Oh, wonderful.
Wonderful.
Happy?
I couldn't be happier.
And now, my friends, if I may take just a moment of your time.
I'm not going to make a speech...
Though I'd like to, because I've never felt happier in my life.
I am simply going to say that it makes Mrs.
Case and me very proud to announce the engagement of our only daughter,
Diana, to Alec Brooke.
A toast, a toast.
To Alec and Diana.
Thanks a lot, bill.
Don't let being engaged keep you awake.
Well, hello.
Hello, Alec.
What are you doing out here this time of night?
Oh, just dreaming an old dream or two.
Ha ha!
Our house looks just the same.
Hmm... Needs a coat of paint.
Are they nice... the people who live in it now?
You know, I like the frasers better.
Alec, listen. The locusts.
Yeah.
They're striking the old g note.
I was always going to explore the old g note road... to its very end. Remember?
Yes.
Won't I ever see you again?
Sure, Nancy. Someday we'll go to High Barbaree together.
Gosh, that was a long time ago.
How is uncle Thad?
Oh, he's fine.
Still sailing the pacific.
I wonder if he ever found High Barbaree.
Never had time, I guess.
I guess.
Yeah.
Diana's very lovely.
Mm-hmm.
You're happy, aren't you, Alec?
Yes. I guess I've got just about everything a young guy could want.
I'm glad.
Remember how we used to talk about you being a doctor?
Yeah.
It was the most vital thing in your life then.
Alec, how could you give all that up so suddenly, so completely?
I can't afford to be a doctor.
Oh, you wouldn't understand.
I think I do.
I don't talk about being a doctor anymore, but I think about it.
I wanted to be a doctor.
I went to medical school for two years, but it would have taken me 5 more to get a start.
Medicine takes too long, costs too much.
Look at my father.
He's worked like a dog his whole life, and what's he got for it?
No, that's...
That's not for me.
When did you begin to fly, Alec?
Oh, while I was in high school.
And how did you happen to go to work for Mr. case?
He kept after me right from the first time
Diana took me to the house.
Finally, he offered me a job that I couldn't turn down, and, well, I've...
I've made good, Nancy.
Of course you have, Alec.
You've always made good.
You always will.
Goodnight, Alec goodnight, Nancy.
Oh, Nancy.
How would you like to go flying with me tomorrow morning?
Why, I'd love it.
You wouldn't be afraid, would you?
With you, Mr. bernadino?
Oh, the great bernadino.
My big moment.
I'll never forget it.
I'll never forget that mustache.
Wahoo!
Wahoo!
Wahoo!
Wahoo!
Ha ha ha!
Wahoo!
Ha ha ha!
How'd you like that?
Wait till I see if
I'm all in one piece.
I have to hand it to you.
You weren't scared.
Of course not.
I told you I wasn't going to be.
Come on. I want to show you my office.
Alright.
Morning, Mr. Brooke.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mrs. Fairmont.
Oh, Mr. Brooke,
Mr. Hoffman of consolidated wire has been calling from Chicago.
Fine. Would you get him right back, please?
Oh! This is a pretty elegant layout you got here.
You really like it?
I'm overwhelmed.
Air-conditioned.
Soundproofed.
Where's the kitchenette?
A little more respect in here, please.
Oh, come here.
There's the baby we're going to test today.
Oh, good luck.
The 20% flap flying position gives the ship better lateral stability.
The automatic wing slot arrangement is new.
Anything new about its intestines and esophagus?
Can't you get your mind off medicine for a minute?
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Mr. Hoffman's on the wire.
Oh, fine. Put him on.
Good morning, Mr. Hoffman.
This is Alec Brooke.
Uh, I'm sorry. Mr. case isn't here just now.
Well, I have the authority.
I'm vice president in charge of that.
Oh, vice president.
He's in charge of that.
And it's been tested at subzero temperature?
Good.
Yes, it looks like we'll get a government contract.
I'll know this morning after the test.
I'll let you know.
Oh, dear, yes.
He'll let you know.
That's why vice presidents are born.
Right.
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.
Good-bye.
Ha ha ha!
What do you mean, trying to break me up?
Don't you know that was $2 million I was talking to?
$2 million?
Yes.
Really?
Ha ha ha!
You kill me.
Well, hello!
Hello, darling.
You're up early, miss Fraser.
It was such a lovely morning.
Wasn't it?
Yes. I just took Nancy up for a little ride.
Oh? Well,
I don't want to interrupt your work, but I thought you might like to see the stories of our engagement.
Yes, I saw them.
That's a nice picture of you.
It did turn out well, didn't it?
Engagements cause such excitement.
Don't they, miss Fraser?
Yes, they do.
Oh, I must be running along.
Oh, and, sweet, the great-aunts are coming to tea this afternoon just to meet you.
5:30 is the absolute deadline.
Maybe you'd like to come, too, miss Fraser.
No, thank you.
I'm leaving today.
Oh? Sorry.
You will be prompt, won't you?
Oh, of course.
Otherwise, your baby might be very cross.
Good-bye, miss Fraser.
Bye.
That was $2 million talking to you.
What kind of a crack is that?
I'm sorry, Alec.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded.
Alec, I... oh. Good morning, miss Fraser.
Good morning, Mr. case.
Good-bye, Alec.
Thank you for everything.
It's been fun.
You can't walk home, Nancy.
It's over two miles.
Wait a minute.
Bad weather report's come in.
I've postponed today's test.
Oh, no. We've postponed it twice already.
You'd better catch colonel Taylor at the hotel and explain.
We'll keep him informed.
Can't we try?
The colonel wanted to get away tonight.
I'll talk to the tower.
No use taking chances.
I want this plane tested under perfect weather conditions.
The army won't fly it under perfect conditions.
Now, now, now.
Just leave this decision to me.
It's not your responsibility.
Come on. Be a good boy.
Phone Taylor. Save him a trip out here.
Okay.
I don't like putting off the army just to play safe with his investment.
Looks like you'll have to learn to like it.
What do you mean by that?
If you want to go on being the young guy who's got everything a young guy could want.
I'll get a car to take you home.
Oh, Alec, why don't you Chuck all this?
Why don't you go back to medical school?
Oh, giving it to me straight, huh?
Oh,
I haven't the time to be subtle.
I may never see you again.
Oh, you don't belong here, Alec.
It's a waste.
You could be a great doctor.
I know what I'm doing.
But you wouldn't have to be a country doctor.
You could be a surgeon or go in for research.
Diana will take you no matter what.
She wants you.
She'll wait.
I can run my own affairs.
Well, the cases are running them now.
You'll go on carrying out Mr. Case's orders, and 10 years from now, you'll have the girl and the business and your 2 million, but you'll find out you've wasted your life doing what you didn't like!
What's all this got to do with you?
Nothing!
Then what are you crying about?
Who's crying?
You are.
I am not...
Very much.
If I cry, it will be over something important, not over somebody who wants a million dollars to marry the boss' daughter.
Don't tell me how to live my life.
Dad can't live it for me.
Mother can't.
You can't.
Now, will you get out?
Oh, yes! Yes, I'm getting out!
And you stay here and be a good, obedient boy!
Call colonel Taylor and tell him the test is off!
Yeah?
Colonel Taylor and the commission are at the field.
I'll be right over.
Sorry, colonel. That was a pretty sloppy takeoff, but it proves you can just about fly out of a shell hole if you have to.
Now, if you want to spot some artillery fire or do some photographing, just slow it down and go to work.
Now, if they open up on you with small ground fire, you get going.
Evasive action, the boys call it.
Oh, you... you big red-headed dope!
If you have to land in a battle area, have them clear a 50-foot circle and set her down. Watch.
Congratulations, Brooke.
It certainly is a deal.
You really liked that job, eh, colonel?
Beautiful job flying,
I have to admit it.
Come on. This calls for a celebration.
Come on.
Hurry up with those things, Mac.
Yes, sir!
Colonel just can't wait to drink to our plane.
You showed me, boys.
You certainly showed me.
We told you you'd be surprised.
And don't you ever try a thing like that again.
Why, when I... excuse me, Mr. case.
Thanks, Mac.
You know, for a couple of minutes there,
I thought we were going to be minus one good vice president.
Well, here's to the fellow who's going to be running this shebang one of these days.
Always wanted a son.
Now I've got one.
Hey, look!
I never saw anything like this before!
It's a tornado!
Alec, voice-over:
That was the worst tornado that ever struck Iowa.
The river overflowed, and both
Bridges were washed out.
For 48 hours, westview was absolutely cut off.
No doctors or nurses could get in, and dad was the only doctor in town.
Hundreds of people were hurt.
All during that first horrible night, we were digging the injured out of the debris.
Alec, your father needs you bad!
He's over at the church.
You'd better get over there.
We'll do this.
Take him up front, if you please.
Right up front.
Alec!
Dad, what's the matter?
What happened?
The wind turned his car over.
Tied a couple of knots in my arm.
Nancy.
I'll get you some tea.
Nancy.
Yes, doctor?
Get Ned Flynn on the operating table right away.
Yes, doctor.
Compound fracture.
Blood vessel badly torn.
He's going into shock.
We've got to stop the bleeding, or he'll die.
But, dad, you can't.
Your arm... you're going to do it for me.
Oh, dad, I...
I can't.
Find that artery that's gushing.
Now take a hemostat and clamp it off.
Easy.
There's a bone splinter.
Get it out.
Get it out.
Now the sutures.
Careful.
That's it.
Good boy.
I'm sure glad that's over.
We'll have a dozen more of them before morning. Come on.
He'll be alright.
It's just exhaustion.
Are you sure?
You run along.
He's sleeping now.
Alec, will you come with me, please?
Dr. Brooke...
This is Dr. Brooke.
He's going to help you.
Get him ready.
We'll come right back.
I'm not Dr. Brooke, and I'm not going to operate.
That piece of steel went right through his stomach.
I can't handle that.
There's a chance for him, and you've got to see that he gets it.
I can't without dad.
The case is as bad as the man who just died.
It's your job, Alec.
You have no choice.
Well, get him ready.
Then sit down for a minute.
Can't you tell when you're all in?
Nancy, this just came for you.
They must be getting things fixed up.
I hope so.
Give this to miss Jones, please.
How can I?
I don't know enough.
I can't take the responsibility.
Oh, Alec, you can.
You're a doctor.
You're a real doctor.
I'm not a doctor.
That was just an emergency.
I did all I could.
I wouldn't have a dirty job like this if it was the only one on earth.
I've chosen my profession, and you and Nancy can't do anything about it.
Now, will you lay off?
Alec, the plane's in:
Doctors, nurses, everything.
Thank god.
I guess every one of us could use some sleep.
Nancy, you look all tired out.
Sit down and let me get you some coffee.
No. The planes are getting through.
I'm going to leave.
Leave? You can't!
I want to get out of here. Now. I must.
Oh. You heard him.
Yes, I did.
Alec.
Alec!
Alec!
What?
Diana's calling you.
Diana?
Yes.
She's on the phone.
What time is it?
Oh, it's so early.
5:00 in the afternoon.
You slept straight through.
What?
Yes. I'll tell her to wait.
Hello, Diana.
How are you?
Well,
I tried to call you several times, but the lines were down.
Then I heard you were alright, so...
Yeah.
Diana, I'd like to see you tonight.
I want to talk something over, something serious.
Good.
See you tonight.
Bye-bye.
How's dad, mom?
Your father's very well today, thank you.
Boy, am I starved.
Ha ha!
Please, don't be mad just because you've got a red-headed dope for a son.
That's your fault.
Did anyone say I was angry?
Oh, I'm sorry I flew off the handle.
I'll try to make up for it today, if you'll let me.
I know something you'd like to hear.
I'm going back to medical school, mother.
Oh, I should have known.
I should have!
Yesterday when you began to storm at me...
Just like your father.
He always barks at me whenever he's upset, whenever he has to make an important decision.
Where's Nancy?
I want to tell her.
Nancy? Nancy's gone.
Gone where?
To San Francisco.
What?
Yes. She took that plane out last night.
Where is she... in San Francisco, I mean?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You mean you let her go to San Francisco and didn't find out where she went?
Hello?
Oh, hello, Mr. Fraser.
This is Alec Brooke.
Mr. Fraser, do you know where
I could reach Nancy?
Well, I couldn't find her there.
That's why I called you.
Why, she sailed today from San Francisco.
Yeah. With her husband, a Navy man.
What did you say?
That's fine.
I said, that's fine.
Alec, voice-over: I tried to tell myself that it wasn't true.
Are you listening, Joe?
I couldn't believe that Nancy could cut me out of her life so deliberately, so finally.
That was the worst thing that ever happened to me.
Worse than this?
No. I guess not.
Hey.
Yeah.
Go on talking.
It keeps me awake.
I'm afraid to go to sleep.
Hang on, Joe.
We'll get to High Barbaree.
We'll be there in a little while.
You and your cockeyed island.
Tell me, did you ever see Nancy again?
Well, after the tornado,
I went back to Harvard med.
Then a little thing like
Pearl harbor came along.
Are you listening, Joe?
This is where you come in.
Remember that last mission before this one?
We'd been out all afternoon, looking for a ditched hellcat.
Then along about sunset, we headed back for guadal.
Hey, look.
There's a convoy in.
We could sure use that cargo.
I hope they've got some of that good Iowa beef.
Looks like the High Barbaree's ready.
Hello, lieutenant.
No luck, commander.
We didn't find the plane.
Alright.
Lewis can make your report, Brooke.
You're wanted down at the beach.
Why?
The beach master phoned.
Some gold-braid wants to see you.
Make it snappy.
You've got to get back.
You're on night patrol.
But my crew needs sleep.
Sorry. We're shorthanded tonight.
You'll go out in your old plane.
You've got 3 hours.
Alright.
Uncle Thad!
Ha ha ha!
Hi.
Yeah, it's me, alright, big as life and twice as ugly, eh, Alec?
I must be dreaming!
No, no. I just kept asking all around the pacific.
Saw two guys from your outfit when
I hit the beach this morning, and here you are.
You sure are a sight for sore eyes, boy.
Well, look at you!
Yeah. Regular Navy.
I put it on special for you.
Aw...
Oh, stop grinning at me that way.
I... I haven't cried since they sunk the Ojibwa.
They got her?
Her and two others, shot right out from under me.
I pretty near learned to swim, Alec.
Oh, you'd be surprised what you can do sometimes.
Oh, no, I wouldn't, uncle Thad.
Ha ha!
Go on up to my cabin.
I'll break out something to celebrate with.
You haven't brought your scotch friends aboard?
Ha ha ha!
Go on.
Get up there.
Maybe I can pull a miracle.
Hello.
Nancy.
I knew you were...
Oh, Alec!
Why did you leave me? Why?
You didn't want me.
Oh, I did, I did, but I was completely off the beam.
How could you run away and marry somebody else?
Oh, I didn't, Alec.
I couldn't.
Oh, Nancy.
Oh, Alec, I couldn't marry anyone but you.
There just couldn't be anyone else.
What are you crying about?
Oh, I...
I think I'm asking you to marry me, and I think maybe if I cry, you'll do something about it.
We've loved each other all our lives, haven't we?
We've lost so much time.
Are we going to be cheated out of everything?
No, not cheated, Nancy.
We can never be cheated now, no matter what.
You've got to look at it this way:
We've had so much... born in the best possible place, brought up decently, given a chance to learn, love things.
As kids, we had the lady-slippers and the old water tower.
Even High Barbaree.
If you ask me, I think that's kind of hitting the jackpot.
Look. There's part of our dream now.
Look how the moon makes a path on the water.
Yes.
Like the old g note road.
Over the earth and back again.
No beginning, no end, darling.
Sorry, mates.
It's time to say so long.
Right, skipper.
See you soon.
See you soon.
Alec, voice-over:
She was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen, Joe, standing there on the deck of the old Osborne, waving at me, and that was the last time I saw her.
Alec, are you sure of our position?
I'm checking it now, Joe, just like you asked me.
We're there.
We're right on the spot.
Do you see it?
No, but it's here.
It's got to be here.
Yeah, sure.
It's got to be here.
Well?
It's too foggy.
You can't see very far.
But it will show up later.
You're a liar.
There's no island.
You poor guy.
I've always believed in it.
Why?
What for?
Why has my whole life led me to this spot?
For nothing.
I can't believe it.
Oh, Joe, you...
You can't...
Can't...
The lord hath given.
The lord hath taken away.
The lord hath taken away.
The lord hath taken away.
Taken away.
There's no sign of life on it.
They don't answer our guns.
Don't get your hopes up.
We don't know what we'll find.
He's alive, uncle Thad.
I know he's alive.
Don't go to sleep, Joe.
Don't go to sleep.
Welcome.
Welcome!
What happened?
I thought I heard a gong.
Yes. That was to call you in.
Who are you?
I am Tangaroa.
Tangaroa?
Yes.
I'm Alec Brooke, lieutenant, U.S. Navy.
Yes.
That means,
"you're welcome, my son."
We'll go now.
Where are we going?
To see if your house is ready for you.
Oh, yes. My house.
Look, there are lady-slippers everywhere!
Yes, but here, we have a different name for them.
Is all this...
Is everything here a dream?
Who can say, young man?
Perhaps the big thing which we call life is itself a dream.
Perhaps to even leave it with pain is also a dream, and what comes after, perhaps, is the best dream of all.
Each man has his own life, each man, his own dream.
Look.
It's the g note road!
Tangaroa, it's the g note road I knew when I was a kid!
Then follow it, Alec Brooke.
Alec!
Alec, here I am!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Nancy.
Nancy.
Nancy!
It's alright, Alec.
It's alright.
Oh, darling.
I dreamt we were on High Barbaree.
We are, darling.
LITTLE JOHN [READING]:
"Gangland guns slay rival racketeer.
Big Tim O'Hara latest victim of underworld war."
This is murder. Just plain murder.
Besides, this is the first time in the history of this organization a rod's had to be used.
You guys by pulling this thing you made Little John awful brokenhearted.
Oh, boss, you shouldn't take that altitude towards us.
The guy was chiseling in on us. Me and
Philadelphia Powell caught him red-handed.
Sure, everybody thought you'd be glad to have that guy illuminated.
Oh, that ain't it.
The job was pulled in Molly Madigan's.
The police closed the joint.
Now where's a guy gonna get a plate of corned beef and cabbage?
Yeah, it was tough on Molly. Using her establishment for that there kind of work.
A lot of people are funny like that.
They don't wanna sit when that merchandise is being carried out.
Besides, why wasn't I in on the know beforehand?
We're partners.
Why wasn't I given no memo?
Lay off, will you?
The guy's washed up, ain't he?
You bet he's washed up.
So is Molly Madigan's business, so is our record and so am I.
- What do you mean?
- You heard.
I've been getting fed up on this business,
I've been thinking of getting out.
This latest transaction convinces me.
- You don't know what you're saying.
- I know exactly.
I'm fed up on this business.
I don't see no career in it no more.
Besides, I'm too sensitive.
Johnny, what are you gonna do?
Plenty. I got my little bundle.
I'm gonna retire, see?
From now on, I'm going after the two things
I've always wanted most.
Good taste and refinement.
I'm gonna get what I was born to have:
Class.
What kind of conversation is this?
The guy's blown his roof off.
Cut the clowning, the guys ain't in a mood.
I ain't clowning. I'm on the level.
I'm through with the rackets forever.
From now on, the business is yours.
I'm stepping out.
Of course, without Little John, you're starting from scratch.
But you'll get along.
- You mean that, Johnny?
- Absolutely.
This is a kiss-off.
Now, you guys are no longer looking at John Sarto, boss of the rackets.
You're now looking at John T. Sarto...
...world sportsman, socialite and art student.
- Where are you going, boss?
- I'm gonna tell Flo.
Then tomorrow, I'm off for London, Paris and St. Moritz...
...and with all the class that goes with them there joints.
Willie, you can come and help me pack.
So long, guys, I won't be seeing you.
He's certainly going a long way to get class.
The way he's going after it, he'll come back reeking with it.
Well, don't worry, pal.
He'll never come back.
Look, Johnny. Don't it look elegant?
Yeah, it's got class all right.
Look, you dumb cluck, you got it pasted on the inside.
Sure, it gets scratched on the outside.
Anybody's smart enough to know that.
Flo, sometimes you got me guessing whether you're even a nitwit.
Okay, Johnny. That's the thanks I get for dropping in to help you pack.
Oh, I'm sorry, baby. Look, I didn't mean
I should hurt your feelings.
I keep forgetting you don't catch on to class faster than I.
Where do you want me to tuck these croquet mallets, boss?
See what I'm up against?
Not croquet, stupid. Them's polo clubs.
- Won't they fit in the trunk?
- Not a chance.
Not even if I bend them.
I got an idea, Johnny.
Pinky Johnson at the Can-Can Club has a black bow fiddle case you can borrow.
No good. Hop over to Can-Can. Ask Pink if he got a brown one he can let you have.
- Okay.
LITTLE JOHN: I wanna match my luggage.
Nobody can say Johnny ain't in good taste.
- Oh, you're always in good taste, Johnny.
- Ha-ha.
That's what's got me kind of jumpy.
I mean, you and me tearing around Rome and all them places...
...and me with a maiden name.
- I don't get you.
I mean us taking this trip.
Us? Who said we're taking the trip?
Well, ain't we?
Look, I don't wanna hurt your feelings but
Little Johnny's gonna take this trip alone.
- But you and me...
- It wouldn't be proper now, would it?
Besides...
...I kind of like to get away by myself for a little while. You understand?
Sure.
I understand.
Oh, Flo.
Why don't you come out and say it.
Say you're tired of me and this is the blow off?
Oh, baby, now how can you talk this way?
How can you even think this way?
Well, it is, ain't it?
When you say that, it's like sticking a knife in me.
When you look like you mean it, it's like breaking the handle off.
[TEARFULLY]
Well, I can't help it, Johnny.
You and me have been going together for five years now.
- Of course I know you've been awful busy...
- Is some woman been talking to you?
But to me if a fella loved a girl enough he could take five minutes off...
...to hop over to the city hall and dig up some judge.
Now, stop mentioning judges.
- I'm superstitious.
- Okay, Johnny. Forget it.
Anyway, we had some good times together.
Oh, now look, baby,
I'm still nuts about you.
We ain't married because we haven't got around to it.
When I come back and I'm a gentleman, we're gonna have a big church wedding.
Gee, and I ain't been in a church since the night your brother was bumped off.
Oh, you're swell, kid.
You know, you deserve the best.
Oh, Johnny.
I ain't forgetting you.
I'm gonna take care of you.
- Are you?
- You bet your life.
I was gonna do something big for you.
- Now's the time.
- Gee, Johnny.
- You always wanna be in show business?
- Do I?
Well, watch.
Get me Al Royer at the Crescent Club.
I'll show how you stand.
The Crescent Club?
The biggest nightclub in town.
Hello, Al.
Little John Sarto.
Oh, fine, pal. How's yourself?
Say, listen, you know Flo Addams, don't you?
My fiancée.
That's right.
Well, look, I'm going off to Europe, see?
While I'm gone I want you to spot her in your nightclub.
That's right.
You will? Well, that's fine,
Al, I appreciate it.
Yeah. She'll be over tomorrow afternoon at 2.
Well, that's fine, pal.
Thanks, pal. So long, pal.
[CHUCKLES]
- Well, do I get into the club?
- You bet your life.
- Tomorrow afternoon you start as...
- As what?
- Hatcheck girl.
Oh, gosh, Johnny.
[BOTH LAUGH]
See how Little John takes care of the people he likes, huh? Ha-ha-ha-ha.
[SHIP HORN BLOWS]
Oh, Johnny.
- Goodbye, Johnny.
- Goodbye, baby. Heh-heh.
- So long.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
I trust you had good luck, monsieur.
- Hmm?
- Heh.
Oh.
Here, pal. Better frame this.
Last one from the biggest sucker in the world.
Thank you, monsieur.
- Oh, uh... Where's the nearest cable office?
- Lobby of the hotel.
Thanks.
- Do you read English?
- Certainly. That is my business.
Well, then read that.
"Monsieur Jack Buck, Willie the Kaniff...
- Knife.
- Oh, yes, "Willie the Knife...
...French Frank, Mugsy O'Day,
Philadephia Powell..."
Yeah, okay, okay. Read the message.
"Good news, boys.
I'm coming home to be your boss again.
With the class I got now, we'll all make plenty of kopecks.
Love and kisses, Little John Sarto."
Yeah, cross out the word kopecks.
Put in mazuma.
Oui, monsieur. Mazuma.
- Yeah, that's better English.
- Oh, oui, monsieur.
Oh, by the way, where's the nearest hockshop?
- Hockshop?
- Yeah, hockshop.
You know, pawnbroker.
- Oh, pawnbroker. Oh, oui, monsieur.
- Mm-hm.
Go to the head doorman at the gambling casino. He has the concession.
Yeah?
I should have known that.
What are your plans in the United States?
Returning to business.
Pressure was brung on me...
...so I skip over to the States, head my organization.
- I see.
- My board of directors are meeting me.
- Oh, a little welcome home party?
- Right.
Pardon me, sir.
They're ready for your baggage now.
Thanks. Well, I'm sorry, you guys, but I have to skip now.
- Thank you, Mr. Sarto.
- The pleasure's all mine.
MAN 1: Hi, Johnny.
MAN 2: Boss. Welcome home.
[GANGSTERS LAUGH]
FRANK:
Johnny, you're a sight for sore eyes.
Same goes for me. Glad to be back.
- Where's Willie the Knife?
- Had business to attend.
- Let me take your baggage.
- Got a car.
- Let me take your arm.
- Wait a minute, now.
Take your foot off the gas.
Where's Jack Buck?
At the joint to welcome you.
All the boys are waiting.
Give me your baggage, I know a guy...
Never mind about the customs.
I got that fixed up already.
- Where's the car?
- A limousine parked outside.
- Come on. Duck this crowd.
- You don't mind this service?
Mind? Boy, I love it.
Push ahead there, will you?
- And open up a path for me.
- Ha-ha-ha.
[CHUCKLES]
Johnny, will the boys be glad to see you.
- Just like yesterday, huh, boss?
- Oh, yeah.
Ha-ha. Oh, uh...
- Say, why ain't my name on there?
- Well, we took it off when you quit, boss.
Well, put it back on. Without my name on there, it ain't got no éclat.
Oh, that's a French word we use in France. It means pretty nifty.
[CHUCKLES]
- Come in, boss. This is it.
- Well, Johnny, welcome home.
How are you?
[GANGSTERS CHATTERING]
Finkie, how are you? How've you...?
Well, say, look at that. Oh, this is grand.
Heh-heh.
Well, I sure appreciate the sentiment, boys. Ahh.
[SNIFFS]
Just like the good old days.
Everything just the way I left it.
Yeah, furniture, books, everything.
LITTLE JOHN:
Still there.
Same old private apartment.
Just the same.
Well, sure looks good.
Boy, remember some of the parties...
...we held in here, eh, pal?
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Yes, sir, Johnny.
Those were the good old days.
Come on in here.
I want you to talk to the boys.
- Sure.
- I want you to take your old seat, up front.
Certainly nice to be back with the old mob.
- Mugsy?
- Yeah?
- Show the boss to his old seat.
- A pleasure.
Thanks, Mugsy. Ha-ha.
- Here you are, boss.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
This is what I've been looking forward to...
[LOUD BUZZING]
[GANGSTERS LAUGHING]
The hot seat, huh? Now, who done it?
Who's the wise guy?
Come on now, speak up.
- If you don't, I'll break every guy's head.
- Relax, you ain't scaring nobody.
- You know who you're talking to?
- Little Johnny Sarto.
You don't mean a thing. You might as well get this through your nut right now.
You walked out on us five years ago and left us flat.
You give me the rackets and made me the boss.
You think I'm gonna be chump enough to step down now?
Oh, so that's it.
- Now I get it.
- As far as the rackets are concerned...
...you're through, Johnny.
Let me give you a little tip.
You can stay around as long as you want to...
...but it'll be healthier if you leave.
Because from now on, I ain't liking you and
I'm liable to not like anything you do, see?
A showdown, huh?
All right, wise guy.
Mugsy. Philadephia. Frank.
Now, who's it gonna be, him or Little John?
Come on, speak up. Who's your boss?
What is this?
- What am I doing, dreaming?
- No, you ain't dreaming.
The sooner you get it through your head that you're out of the business, the better.
- Now, get out of here.
- Why, you. Uhn!
Go on. Throw him out on the street.
- All right, wise guy.
- Let me go.
I'll get out but I'm coming back.
I'm organizing a new mob and someday
I'm gonna blast you right off the earth.
- I'll show you yellow mugs...
- Don't stand there.
- Throw him out.
- Hands off me.
Get him out of here.
Come on, get out. Get him out of here.
All right, get out of here.
[DOOR CLOSES]
[HURRIED FOOTSTEPS]
- Here, now.
- Huh?
Where do you think you're going?
Up to Miss Addams' apartment.
I'm Little John Sarto.
I don't care what size you are.
You ain't going up to no Miss Addams' apartment.
- Why not?
- Because about eight months ago...
...Miss Addams upped and flew her fine feathers...
...over to the Parkway Biltmore.
The Parkway Biltmore?
- What'd she do, get a job as a maid?
- I don't know.
But it's been said she's doing real well.
Yeah?
Well, thanks.
MAN: Ackers, Addison, Anderson,
Appleby, Bassett, Bliss.
No, there's no Miss Addams working here.
Her landlady said she came eight months ago.
Well, I'm sorry, buddy, but we ain't got no record of it.
Hey, Al, you better step on it.
Miss Addams wants to see them.
- Okay. Okay.
- Here. Just a minute.
Addams? Could that be Flo Addams?
No. This is Miss Florence Addams, a guest.
Couldn't be the one you're looking for.
Yeah? Well, I'm just crazy enough to go up and see.
Here. Wait a minute.
[DOORBELL BUZZING]
Tell Albert to drag them in. I ain't got time.
[IN FRENCH ACCENT]
Oui, madame.
Oh, come in, Albert.
Ha-ha! Napoleon. Ho-ho-ho.
Oh, Fifi...
Johnny.
Oh. Oh, Johnny.
Oh, never mind the hysterics.
- Get rid of the audience.
- You can go now.
Take Napoleon and Josephine out.
Me and Mr. Sarto wish to be alone.
Oh, Johnny. Five years you've been gone.
Gee, you don't know how I've missed you.
Yeah. From the looks of things it's good I come back.
What's that idea of all this layout?
Well, you always wanted me to have class, didn't you?
Yeah, but this joint's so full of it, it leaks.
Don't tell me you got it selling cigarettes.
- I ain't a cigarette girl no more.
- You ain't?
- When'd you quit the Crescent Club?
- I didn't.
- You didn't?
- I own it.
- What are you, kidding?
- I bought Al Royer out a year ago.
- With what, hay?
- Alfalfa. That's what Clarence raises.
Cla...
Now, look, one of us is cuckoo.
Now, let's start this over again.
- Who's Clarence?
- A big rancher from out West.
He's interested in cows.
Oh, yeah?
Especially when they wear petticoats.
If you're insinuating anything, you're mistaken. I ain't worn a petticoat in years.
Well, from now on this cowboy's out of the picture, see?
Tell him pack up his wigwam go back to the wide-open spaces.
- You're jealous.
- No, I ain't.
I'm suspicious of a guy that looks for pastureland on 42nd Street.
- Johnny.
- What?
You ain't kissed me yet.
Well, I'll get around to that.
First I got something important to do.
Where's Willie the Knife?
In Pattonsville. That's a private sanitarium, over in Jersey for mental disorders.
Say, he's got his nerve going crazy just when I need him?
He ain't crazy. He's playing at it to get away from Jack Buck.
He quit him a couple of weeks ago.
Jack Buck's a bad guy, Johnny.
Yeah, I found out about that. But don't worry, he ain't gonna be much longer.
Oh, hello, operator, get me the Pattonsville Sanitarium.
That's right, New Jersey.
All right, I'll hold on.
There's a rumor Jack Buck don't like you no more.
I confirmed it.
That's why I gotta act quick.
I don't think you'll get Willie.
They're funny about guests.
Oh, I'll get him all right.
This is Little John Sarto.
How long will it take us to where Willie's at?
- Forty minutes.
- Good. I'll tell him we'll pick him up.
Maybe he won't wanna leave.
He told me he's in a grand hideout...
...and having a swell time with his mental disorder.
If he told you that they ought to keep him there.
Oh, hello, Pattonsville?
Let me talk to Willie Corson.
Who am I? His grandfather.
Who do you think?
Just a moment.
The phone, Willie.
Your grandfather wants to talk to you.
Go on, the phone.
Don't keep Grandpa waiting.
That's a nice boy.
Okay, I'll bite.
But sometimes I don't know who's being kept here.
You guys or me.
- Hello?
LITTLE JOHN: Oh, listen, Flathead.
- This is Little John Sarto.
- Boss!
I want you to pick up roscoes and if you grab a torpedo or two...
Boss, you forget where I am.
They're awful peculiar up here...
...and they get hurt if you walk out on a joint.
Just leave a note and say that you, well, went to the store.
- That'll take care of everything.
- Of course, I ain't really wacky.
I had meself put into the joint but the kiss-off may not be so easy.
Listen, you leave everything to me, see? I'm back and I need you.
I ain't got no time for no red tape.
I'll be up to get you. Now, you be ready.
All right, put a hat on. We're shoving off.
- Well, I guess I don't.
- Don't what?
Don't get kissed.
All right. It's broad daylight, but come on.
[LAUGHS]
Oh, Johnny.
Mmm, mmm, mmm!
Hey.
This cowboy of yours. You sure you ain't been doing no rehearsing?
- What do you mean?
- The way you come at me.
I don't know whether you're gonna hug me...
...or saddle me.
- Ah, mm-hmm.
Pardon, madame.
Monsieur Fletcher is on the phone.
Oh. That's Clarence. Wait a minute.
Hello, Clarence. Say, where are you at?
I reckon you're gonna be powerful mad at me.
For being so late in phoning you.
This morning I got so lonesome to see a cow...
...that I went over to Jersey to the stockyards.
Whenever me and cows get together, time just don't mean nothing.
Well, what about the curtain material?
Well, say, I'm having mighty poor luck trying to match this here material for you.
It seems like every store in town is just plumb out of it.
Oh, well, let it go, Clarence.
Where is your car?
I wanna borrow it for a friend of mine.
You'll do no such thing. Tell him to pack up and get out of town.
Wait a minute, Clarence. Don't be a lug.
He can drive. You and me sit in the back seat and talk.
Who is this mug? Can he be trusted?
Oh, sure he can. He's dumb but nice.
You'll feel sorry for him.
And he loaned me a lot of money.
Tell him to get here quick and have plenty of gas in his car.
Okay. Clarence, you get right over here and put plenty of gas in your car.
You know what?
You're gonna drive me and my boyfriend out in the country.
You bet. That sure is nice of you.
[MAKING BIRD CALLS]
Gee, honey, it's nice to have you back.
Now, that's the third time you've told me.
You don't have to oversell it.
- What's that whistling I hear?
- That's Clarence making birdcalls.
He's awful good.
[HOOTING]
You wanna see him impersonate a robin?
What'll he do, eat a worm?
Johnny, you just don't like him.
He's awful nice.
You know what?
He loaned me $ 10,000...
...to buy out the club and never asked for nothing.
How'd you meet him?
In a way any respectable lady would meet a perfect gentleman.
He passed out in the club one night.
What'd you do, hold his head?
No, his wallet. But I'd give it back to him the next night.
So you had to prove you was dumber than him, huh?
Johnny, you're jealous and you don't have to be.
He don't mean a thing.
You're the only one who was ever in my life and ever will be.
I'm sorry, baby,
I think I know how you feel.
- I'm gonna give you a chance to prove it.
- How?
- Do you love me?
- Oh, do I?
Then put that robe around my legs, will you? My ankles are getting cold.
- Who's the guy driving for him?
- I don't know.
Do you know that guy, Mugsy?
Some guy that's been hanging around the Crescent Club.
They say Flo is the lull in his life.
Oh, yeah?
We better check up on him when we get back.
You two wait here.
I'll only be a few minutes.
- How do you like Mr. Sarto, Clarence?
- Oh, I like him fine.
Sure makes me feel awful discouraged, though.
Why?
He's so nice and outspoken.
Nothing put-on.
That's what I like in him.
I reckon so do the ladies.
Well, they better not.
Not while I'm around.
Gee, it must be swell.
- What?
- For Mr. Sarto.
Having a wonderful girl like you in love with him.
- Oh, now, Clarence.
- I mean it.
I know how I'd be.
You'll meet the right girl someday,
Clarence.
You just have to feel your way.
All I wanna do is get Willie out of here. I'm his employer.
Well, that won't be difficult.
This is a private institution.
Willie confined himself here voluntarily.
He's free to leave...
...any time he feels that he's re-acquired his mental faculties.
Let me talk to him.
I'll tell him to get them back.
- Where is he?
- Right down the hall.
I'll show you.
[DOOR OPENS]
Boss. Am I glad to see you.
Welcome home. Here, sit down.
Wait. Take it easy. That's what the guys told me and it was a foul ball.
Not with me.
I'm a hundred percent for you.
Well, you better be.
I got things to tell you...
Excuse us, will you?
I wanna talk to Willie alone.
- Certainly. I'll be in the office.
- Thanks. A nice gent.
Boss, I can't get over that you're back.
Now, button your lip and listen, will you?
I got work for you to...
Move over, Willie.
I got work for you to do, see?
Now, here's what I want you to do.
Don't say nothing to them.
They're bad medicine.
Shucks, I ain't afraid of a few lunatics.
Hello, kid.
- Good morning.
- What's your boyfriend doing?
- Got something up his sleeve?
- Just ignore him, Clarence. He'll go away.
Double talk.
I reckon you boys better go someplace else.
That's nice, fellas.
Now, come on. Come on.
That's a hot one.
- Where'd your boyfriend go, toots? Inside?
- Don't pay them no attention.
Play like they're not here.
Now, come on, fellas. Be nice boys.
Now, come on, fellas, come on.
I gotta round up a new organization.
Gonna pull a mob that'll run Jack Buck out of the country.
You're talking. Who'll we get?
I don't know. I've been away for five years.
Times have changed.
Who do you know tough and running around?
- What month is this?
- June. Why?
Handsome Harry Edwards'll be out.
I can grab him in Philly.
Now, who else?
A torpedo is what I'll need.
Turkey Malone is the guy. He just got back from fighting in one of them foreign wars.
- Is he any good?
- Is he any good?
- They was paying him piecework.
- Okay. Here's what you do.
Take a powder out the joint.
Round up a mob...
...and meet me Saturday at the Crest Hotel.
We'll work out of there. Don't forget.
Don't do anything to Jack Buck...
...or his mob beforehand that'll tip him off.
- Right.
[FLO SCREAMS, GLASS BREAKS]
- What's that?
- Sounds like a mutiny.
[FLO SCREAMS]
[BLOWS LANDING]
Nothing to worry about, Mr. Sarto.
I'm just bringing in a couple of nuts here...
...that was kind of bothering
Florence and me.
Look. Look, boss, who they are.
- Where's Flo?
- In the car.
She fainted.
I'm going out and tell her to move over.
What time is it?
- Twenty after 11.
- Maybe something happened to Willie.
I don't like this whole setup, boss.
We're conning ourselves if we think we can knock over Buck.
What are you talking about? Didn't I take the pushcart peddlers away from him?
The fruit peddlers in Canarsey?
Who had them before? Jack Buck.
Who now? Me.
We done a lot in 10 days, but still we gotta be careful.
So far all we've grabbed off this guy Buck has been peanuts.
- But this is different.
- Now look, you mugs.
I'm getting tired of this conversation.
If any of you are nervous, wanna drop out, there's the door.
You got us wrong, Johnny.
We ain't yellow.
We just think you're going a little too far too soon with Jack Buck.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Shut up, everybody.
Open the door, Harry.
Come in, gentlemen.
Look, Johnny.
I don't know nothing. I never did noth... Oh!
Shut up. I'll do the talking.
You answer when you're told to.
Put him in a chair.
We hear Jack Buck's got a date...
...with the Acme Paving Company to sell them some protection.
Who's he meeting, where's it gonna be?
- We ain't got no date with the Acme.
- You're a liar. We know all about it.
You gonna get smart and talk?
Do you need working on?
Don't know nothing. Even if they got a date, I don't know about it.
Your last chance.
Gonna spill it or I start to work?
You're crazy, Johnny.
You can't get away with this.
Oh!
- I'll talk, boss. I'll talk.
- Now you're getting smart.
Who's he gonna see and where?
They're seeing Tom Bailey on 8th Avenue this afternoon at 3:00.
The fee is 2 Gs a month. Philadelphia
Powell and Al Muller will be present.
Now that's all I wanted to know.
See how easy it was to talk, Mugsy?
Give him a cigar, Dopey.
No, sir, Mr. Bailey, you haven't got a thing to worry about.
From now on, if any of the men get out of line all you do is reach for a telephone.
We'll only bite you once a month for your dues. That's all there is to it.
Naturally, I want to avoid any more trouble.
I think you know what...
[DOOR OPENS]
Just got here in time, huh?
- What do you care? What do you want?
MALONE: Hoist them.
Wait a minute, gentlemen.
What's this all about?
Now, just a minute, Mr. Bailey. I'm Little
John Sarto. What were these mugs doing?
AL: You're gonna be sorry.
- Shut up.
These gentlemen represent a protective organization.
I was just on the point of taking a policy with them.
Well, you ain't, see?
You're taking it out with me.
These mugs couldn't protect a nurse in a baby parade.
- Throw them out.
- You heard him. Come on.
Sit down, Mr. Bailey.
Now, you and me'll get together on some real protection.
I reckon it ain't very important.
The newspapers'd be making lot more of it.
I know, but sometimes the littlest items make the biggest funerals.
It just makes me sick way down inside to see you so worried.
- If there was just something I could do.
- Monsieur Sarto is on the telephone.
Oh, okay, Fifi.
Hello. I've been thinking about you.
Where you at?
I'm at the hotel.
I won't be able to see you for dinner tonight.
Oh, you gotta lay low, huh?
No. I got a new deal on the fire.
It means a lot to me.
And I wanna close it quick.
Now, stop worrying, will you?
How can I help it? Every time the phone rings or somebody knocks at the door...
...I get the needles, thinking something's happened.
Listen, baby. We can't go on like this. Why, yesterday afternoon I couldn't sleep a wink.
I know how it is but can't you see
I'm doing all this for us, see?
When I'm back on top again, you and me'll be married.
We'll have a life that'll be the talk of the town.
Tell you what. Call me up later, let me know where you're at.
Okay.
Everything all right?
Oh, sure, everything's all right.
If it's money, Florence,
I'd be more than happy to help out.
I wouldn't dare offer Johnny money.
He'd knock me for a loop.
It's terrible, Clarence. It's terrible.
You want me to tell you something?
Know why he's going through all this?
- I reckon he's broke.
- No, that ain't it. It's on account of me.
- You know what he just said?
- What?
He just said that when he was on top, we were gonna be married.
Ain't that grand?
[GLUMLY]
Yeah.
- It sure is.
- And me, I ain't doing nothing to help him.
Even now he's in a spot,
I ain't doing nothing to take him off it.
I reckon your worrying about him ain't gonna help matters none.
What you need is a vacation.
A couple of months on my ranch would do you good.
Oh, if there was just something
I could do.
You'd make a mighty pretty picture coming through the willows in the moonlight.
Everything so peaceful and quiet.
Did you ever smell alfalfa?
No. Who makes it?
It's grass.
Sure smells sweet after it's just been cut.
Yeah. Me smelling alfalfa and him cooped up in a cheap hotel room...
...fighting to make a comeback for me.
I know you'd like it on the ranch,
Florence, with all the horses and the dogs.
I got a cute little gentle pinto pony you could have.
- All the rest of them buck but he...
- Buck.
You give me an idea.
- Jack Buck.
- What about Jack Buck?
I'm going right to Jack Buck myself.
It's a lot of baloney him and Johnny being enemies. They got too much on each other.
Guess who's outside?
- Yeah? Who?
- Flo Addams.
- Anybody with her?
- She's all by herself.
Says she's gotta see you right away.
Oh, she does, huh?
- All right, let her come in.
- Okay.
- Mike.
MIKE: Yes, sir?
Johnny Sarto's girl is here.
Watch the front just in case.
- Hello, kid.
- Hello, Jack.
Come on in. Glad to see you. Sit down.
Before I say a word...
...you gotta promise me something.
- What is it?
Don't say nothing to Johnny about this.
He'd be sore if he knew I was here.
I won't say a word.
What's on your mind?
You and Johnny shouldn't be fighting.
This is all a lot of hooey.
It ain't nice, is it?
You and him used to be partners once.
- You ought to be again.
- Yeah, but Johnny don't like me no more.
It makes me feel bad too.
It's no good you two being enemies.
You got too much on each other.
- We have?
- Sure.
Coppers still wanna know who knocked off Big Tim O'Hara...
...in Molly Madigan's café about five years ago.
Little John knows all about that.
That's right. That's right. I forgot that entirely. Thanks for reminding me.
You and Johnny could sit down and talk over your differences easy, Jack.
I wish we could. It makes me feel sick to have Johnny mad at me.
Then why don't you do it?
Why don't you get together and chew the rag?
- I bet you end up shaking hands.
- I'd like to.
Johnny wouldn't make no date with me alone.
It wouldn't hurt to try, would it?
I could arrange it.
- You could?
- Sure. Where do you wanna meet him?
Well, let's see...
What about Fat Dutchy's at say, 10:00 tonight?
That's a little far out, ain't it?
[CHUCKLES]
Don't worry.
I ain't thinking what you're thinking.
I just wanna get away from the boys.
All the boys.
- You know what I mean?
- Sure.
Couldn't you make it some lawyer's office?
Oh, that's no good.
Right away we start off distrusting each other.
What Johnny and me's gotta do is forget the rough stuff. Like you said.
Him and me has gotta sit down alone together.
Then in five minutes we're pals just like we used to be.
Am I right?
Oh, I'd do anything in the world to see it like that.
Okay, then.
You have Johnny at Fat Dutchy's tonight at 10:00.
I'll be the first guy to stick out my hand.
- You're on the level? You ain't kidding?
- You got my word.
- And no funny business?
- Johnny's my old-time pal.
I wouldn't hurt him for the world.
Him and me just had a business misunderstanding.
Oh, thanks, Jack.
Oh, and by the way, don't let him know
I'm gonna be there.
It'd be better for us just to bump into each other.
- You know what I mean?
- I'll get him there. You gotta do the rest.
Okay.
Oh, Flo.
Yeah?
You're a swell dame.
- Yeah?
- Johnny's a pretty lucky guy.
What you're doing for him makes me think this ain't a bad world after all.
Well, you're not such a bad guy yourself, Jack.
- So long.
- So long, kid.
[PRESSES BUTTON]
MAN: Yes, boss?
- Don't let them gorillas go back to Chicago.
[TIRES SCREECH]
Don't make any dates for tonight,
Clarence.
- Are we going out?
- Yeah.
I'm taking you someplace with me for protection.
I ain't so dumb as somebody thinks.
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS INSIDE TAVERN]
Remember, Clarence. Park over there, don't come in unless I holler for you.
I still don't like the idea of your going in there alone.
Forget it. I've been in this joint before, ain't even been flirted with.
Go on.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Thanks.
Hey, waiter.
- Yes, lady?
- Where's your telephone?
I'll bring you one.
- Give me the phone.
- Here it is.
- Gee, class, huh?
- Yeah.
- Fat Dutchy seen them do it up in the city.
- Well, what do you know?
Thanks.
Long-distance, Crescent 99499.
[PHONE RINGS]
Hello?
[SLURRING]
Hello, Johnny. This is Flo.
Don't do that. Can't you see I'm talking to a friend of mine?
Don't mind him, Johnny.
He just thinks he's funny.
Who's getting funny? Where you at?
You're gonna be awful mad at me, baby.
You're oiled. Have you been drinking?
I'm as sober as you are but they won't let me drive the car.
Will you come and get me, baby?
I'm at Fat Dutchy's.
Fat Dutchy's? That's 30 miles from here.
If you think I'm coming to get you, you're crazy.
I don't think you love me anymore.
If you did, you'd come and get me...
...before I pass out all over the place.
If you're trying to get me nervous, you're not.
I'm busy in a conference.
Get a cab, let me alone.
Okay, my friend, if that's the way you feel about it...
...just forget I ever bothered you.
I'll phone Clarence.
He'll come and get me and I'll tell him what I just heard...
...about Jack Buck and the
Independent Freight Handlers Association.
Goodbye.
Wait. Don't hang up. What's that you were saying about Jack Buck...
...and the Freight Handlers Association?
- Never mind. You're not interested.
You're in a big conference.
You're awful busy.
Stop it, will you?
Don't be so playful.
Hello, Johnny.
Hang up will you, so's I can call Clarence?
No, I don't want you to come.
Just forget about me.
I'll see you around sometime.
Will you stop that talk?
I'll come out and get you.
Don't drink no more. Get them palookas away from you. Be right out.
Okey-dokey.
- Wait here.
- Yes, sir.
Buddy, are you Miss Addams' chauffeur?
Miss Addams? Yeah. Why?
She wanted me to give you this note.
[HORN HONKS]
- May I check your hat, sir?
- No, I'll hold it. I won't be here long.
What's the big idea?
[NORMAL VOICE]
Hello, honey.
I'm glad you come. Sit down.
What are you telling me you were stewed for?
Oh, well, I was, honey, but it wore off.
Have you been thinking about me lately?
Are you nuts?
What's going on here, anyway?
- What do you mean what's going on?
- What's the idea of coming here?
Stop acting like you was making a play.
We know each other.
Well, I was blue this afternoon and I went for ride.
Must've been awful blue to come this far.
Listen, if I gave in to all my worries
I'd be in Omaha.
Well, get your things together.
- We'll blow out of here.
- Don't you want a drink first?
You ain't never seen me take a drink in your life.
I don't like the way you're sparring.
You're hiding something.
Oh, honey, I've never seen you so suspicious.
- Well, come on.
- All right.
I'll powder my nose and then we'll go.
Thanks, Flo.
JACK:
Hello, Johnny.
Glad to see you, pal.
Hello, Jack.
What's the gag?
You're all alone, Johnny.
This is a good time for you and me to have a little talk.
Well, take that rod out of my back.
I'll listen.
It's warm in here.
How's about you and me stepping outside for a few minutes, huh?
- I'm comfortable here.
- Yeah, but I'm not.
The music upsets me.
Makes me nervous. My hand is shaking.
You know what I mean?
Come on.
- Hi, Herman.
- Hi, Jack.
- Hello, Dave. How's the missus?
- Fine, Jack.
Lovely people.
All right, pal, let's go. Get in, Johnny.
Only one thing I wanna know.
Sure, Johnny. Speak right up.
Why did Flo double-cross me?
Now, why don't you get smart.
She wanted the other guy.
You come back and was in the way.
That makes sense, don't it?
Yeah.
That makes sense.
Okay, come on.
- So this is it, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, this is it.
- Okay, Red. Get going.
- Come on, start walking.
See what's on the radio, will you, Mugsy?
WOMAN [OVER RADIO]:
Now to go forth to sleep.
Stretch legs out, toes in.
Everybody got his little tootsies in?
Oh, wait.
Hey, listen, buddy.
If I get back you get 5 grand.
You got it on you, darling?
- No, but I could dig it up in a week.
- Sorry, sweetheart.
We do a strictly cash business.
Keep going.
[GUNSHOT]
[GUNSHOTS]
[GRUNTS]
[GROANS]
[FOOTSTEPS]
It's midnight, Brother Superior.
Our meeting has lasted a long time.
Perhaps tomorrow things will look better.
That's what we've been telling ourselves for the past three months.
With conditions in the flower market...
...I don't see how we're gonna continue our charities.
We must think of some kind of plan.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Come in.
Brother Superior, please come to the infirmary at once.
- What has happened?
- Ten minutes ago...
...I heard a groan outside the wall of my window. It was a man terribly hurt.
I carried him in. I think he's dying.
Come.
[BLOWS]
I made it. I'm in heaven.
BROTHER SUPERIOR:
Don't excite yourself, my son.
You've been badly hurt.
If I'm not in heaven, where am I?
You're alive and in a safe place.
Hey, do you know who I am?
No.
You never seen my picture in the papers?
We don't see the newspapers here.
And we don't ask who a man is if he needs help.
How long am I in for?
Until you're well and strong again.
Well, I ain't got no money.
Neither have we.
That makes you one of us, doesn't it?
This is the Monastery of the Little Brothers of the Flowers.
I am Brother Superior.
This is Brother Wren, your nurse.
If you wish us to notify your friends...
I got no friends.
Well, you have now.
Now, you must try to rest.
I'll call in later.
If you want anything, ask Brother Wren.
Brother Wren, huh?
You was a fighter once, wasn't you?
We don't ask questions like that.
What we were, good or bad, rich or poor, big or small...
...doesn't matter here.
That's double jake by me.
- I think I'm gonna like this place.
- I hope so.
Say, tell me something.
What's the graft here?
- Graft?
- Yeah.
[CHUCKLES]
It's been 15 years or more since I've heard such talk.
We raise flowers and sell them in the city.
Oh, say, there's good gelt in that.
I bet your boys are cutting up a nice profit, huh?
Well, what we clear, and lately it's been very little...
...we give to the poor.
Well, that's a nutsy way to run an organization.
- Oh, Brother?
- Yes?
Was the boss conning me about newspapers? You guys never read them?
Brother Superior is right.
We never read them.
- How about visitors?
- We very rarely have any.
Boy, oh, boy. What a spot.
Say, tell me, how does a guy join up with this outfit?
Well, it's fairly easy.
- If a man wants to become a novice...
- A which?
A novice.
They don't take holy vows.
They have few religious duties...
...chiefly saying their payers.
They are not permitted to go outside the walls, and they must obey their superiors.
Yeah. Well, what's the other catches?
As a novice, a man must be on probation.
- That means...
- Yeah, I know all about probation.
- When can I sign?
- You'll have to talk to Brother Superior.
Oh, and by the way...
...would you care to give us your name?
Oh, while I'm here I think
I'm gonna let you guys call me Lucky.
Well, I'm afraid that wouldn't be acceptable in the Floracian Order.
Oh, it wouldn't, huh?
I got it.
This spot's got something to do with flowers.
Well, I always was a great guy for orchids.
That'll be my new tag, Brother Orchid.
That's fine.
We'll tell Brother Superior tomorrow.
Now, meanwhile, you must try to sleep.
Say, look, Brother, could you slip me that paper and a pencil?
Of course.
There you are.
And while you're writing,
I'll go for a stamp and an envelope.
Oh, thanks.
Heh.
Huh.
[DOOR CLOSES]
"Dear Willie...
Uh...
Beat it...
...for Kansas City...
...and stay there...
...for when I wanna get you.
I'm okay...
...and in a swell hideout...
...run by the biggest chumps in the world."
[BIRDS CHIRPING, BELL TOLLING]
- There.
- Thanks.
I'm sure you'll be comfortable here.
If you want anything, just call me.
I'll be nearby, hoeing potatoes.
Hoeing potatoes?
Say, don't you never get tired?
You been sitting up with me three or four nights in a row now.
That was because you needed me.
But like all the brothers,
I still have my regular work to do.
You're a funny ghee.
Well, so is the rest of this mob around.
You know, I don't get you birds at all.
Our lives hold no mystery.
We've merely learned that in doing things for others...
...it is we ourselves who reap the richest reward.
Reward, huh?
I figured there was a take somewhere.
Say, slip me the info.
How does the dough actually get in here?
No, there's no material gain.
The reward I mentioned is the happiness that comes to the heart...
...when a man knows he has been of service to another human.
Yeah?
I don't know whether you got something there or not.
You make it sound right.
But the rules in the world
I been living in ain't like that.
Well, perhaps you learned the new rules and the old ones are so much better.
But you've talked enough.
You mustn't waste your strength.
If you need me, just call.
Hmm.
Are you feeling better now?
Yeah.
Oh, hello. Hello, Brother Superior.
Grab a chair somewhere.
I wanna talk to you.
In a few moments.
Brother Williams cut his foot with a rake.
- I must see him right away.
- Sure.
But I'll hurry back.
We should have a little chat.
You're well enough to leave for the outside world.
Hey, wait a minute.
Didn't Brother Wren tell you
I was signing up with your league?
He did mention that you were thinking about becoming a novice.
Well, sure. I give him all the dope.
I thought I'd be all set by now.
You are.
I wanted to make certain that your decision came from your heart.
From the heart?
Brother Superior,
I've been giving this joint the double O.
I've met a lot of the inmates personally.
You're all okay guys.
So just you write your own ticket and I'll sign.
Okay, Brother Orchid.
Splendid, Brother Orchid.
Yes. I always was one who could wear a uniform.
- Are your sandals comfortable?
- Hmm?
Oh, pretty nifty.
Say, this is the first time I've seen shoes that are air-conditioned. Heh-heh-heh.
- Your hat, Brother Orchid.
- Oh, thanks.
Genuine Kansas panama, huh?
[CHUCKLES]
Well, it ain't much but I'll fix it up.
I'll put a feather in it.
Well, thanks, pal. Be seeing you.
Well, well, now.
I have a surprise for the brothers.
What is it?
The roses brought $2 more than we anticipated.
As a reward, I've decided to take the money and give you a treat.
BOTH: A treat?
- What's it gonna be?
On Thursday for lunch, we shall have watermelon.
BROTHER MACEWEN:
Watermelon. Marvelous.
BROTHER GOODWIN:
Watermelon?
Why, we haven't had watermelon for over two years.
BROTHER SUPERIOR:
It'll be quite a delicacy for us.
- What are you doing?
- Shaving your head.
No, you don't.
Do you have to?
No. It's quite optional.
Well, nothing doing.
See, I got my looks to think about.
- Oh, come in, Joseph.
- You got a vibrator in the joint?
- A what?
- Skip it. I know you ain't.
Brother MacEwen will cut your hair in a moment.
Thank you, Brother Superior.
By the way, you ought not to go barefooted.
Your mother tells me you're recovering from a cold.
I haven't any shoes, Brother Superior.
I was gonna get them this week, but Father was laid off.
Have you no shoes at all, Joseph?
Here, Joseph. Here are $2.
You run in to town and get a pair of shoes.
MacEwen will cut your hair when you get back.
- Gee, thanks.
- Come, my boy.
- Say, what about the watermelon?
- Watermelon? Heh.
- I never cared for it.
- Me either.
It always distresses me.
Hmm?
I get it.
Nice mugs.
How am I doing, pal?
It's a miracle, Brother Orchid.
No one else has ever been able to get as much milk from Hildegard as you.
Yeah, just a certain touch I got, that's all.
It must be more than that, Brother Orchid.
- It must be.
- Why?
Because you have been with us such a short time.
Yet whatever you attempt, you do so much better than we who've been here for years.
Well, you boys don't want to get discouraged.
I always was a little bit better than the other guy.
I ain't conceited about it because I found it out when I was young.
That still doesn't explain this milking of yours.
I milked Hildegard for years.
And do as I might, she never yielded more than 12 quarts a day.
Yet from the first time you milked her, she gave 16.
Oh, well, it just sums up to one thing, pal.
I put a little more into my work and get a little more out.
- We bear wonderful news, Brother Orchid.
- Congratulations.
- What about?
- Thanks to you...
...for the month just ended,
Hildegard has yielded a total of 492 quarts.
AGED BROTHER:
It's beyond belief.
Brother Superior asked us to tell you your reward.
Beginning tomorrow, you're to be given your own zinnia bed to cultivate all by yourself.
Zinnia bed, huh? That good?
Zinnias earn us most of our money in the flower market this time of the year.
You will have a grave responsibility.
And I might add that is the highest award a brotherhood can bestow upon a novice.
No kidding, huh?
Well, say, I sure appreciate that. Heh.
With your permission, we'll go at once and spread the good tidings to all the brothers.
Yeah. Go ahead, pals.
I wanna be alone, you know.
Getting this honor makes me feel a little dizzy.
[BROTHERS CHUCKLING]
You know, these guys are so swell to me,
Hildegard, I just ain't got the heart.
Beginning right now, I'm only gonna spike it two quarts instead of three.
[CREAKING]
It's not so much that they're the best zinnias we've ever grown...
...but it's the thought that Brother Orchid has raised them all by himself.
It is remarkable.
Think of him when he arrived, to realize that after three months...
...he's developed into one of our best workers.
Yes, he is a changed man.
And his work reflects the change too.
Look.
Look. Aren't they beautiful?
BROTHER SUPERIOR:
Congratulations. These are lovely.
- Very lovely.
- Yeah, thanks, Brother Superior.
I was telling Brother Superior how hard you worked.
Yeah, I am kind of tuckered out.
But I don't mind it.
They're very beautiful but you mustn't work too hard.
I can't help it. You know, them zinnias are just like my babies.
Would you believe it?
Sometimes in the night...
...I catch myself wanting to get up and give them a drink.
We're very proud of you.
You're setting us all a splendid example.
Well, thank you, warden.
I mean, Brother Superior.
I guess I am giving you something to shoot at.
This being Wednesday, tonight after supper,
I will deliver one of my informal talks.
You shall be the subject.
Yeah?
Well, say, that's swell. Heh-heh.
Glad you tipped me off.
Ain't taken a bow in so long.
I'm afraid my back will creak.
- Continue with your work, Brother Orchid.
- Yeah. Thanks.
[WHISTLES]
[RUSTLING]
Hop to it. You got more rows to hoe, then knock off for the day.
Brother Orchid, my father says I should ask you...
...when you're gonna pay me the 50 cents for last month.
Oh.
Tell your old man not to worry.
Maybe tomorrow I'll slip you an IOU.
That'll do you as much good as my check.
Now hop to it, will you?
Ahh.
As is customary, tonight I had planned one of my informal talks.
My subject was to have been a brother who has been with us just a few months.
Unfortunately, just before supper, an incident took place...
...which makes it impossible for me to deliver the talk I had previously planned.
What I am about to say pains me very deeply.
We have worked together in harmony for a long, long time.
But now...
...for the first time in more than 20 years...
...I find I must publicly reprimand a member of this order.
- Brother Orchid...
- Huh?
...just before this meal,
Joseph's father came to see me.
He tells me that his son has been working in your zinnia patch...
...and that you now refuse to pay him.
- Is that true?
- Why, the little muzzler.
Brother, you are not answering the question.
Has Joseph been doing your work?
Well, no, not exactly.
I did have the kid toss a pail or two of fertilizer but I couldn't help it.
I'm allergic to it.
There are times, Brother Orchid, when we appreciate your earthy witticisms.
This is not such a time.
I'm sorry.
The fact remains that you promised
Joseph money...
...and you had no money with which to pay him.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
We have two rules here, my friend:
One, we do not hire others to do our work.
Two, we do not make promises we cannot fulfill.
You have hurt and shamed every man in this room.
Because, being brothers, we must all share your disgrace.
That is all. Good night.
Here, wait a minute now.
I got something to say too.
You're all making me feel like I was a heel and I don't like it.
You know, not so long ago, I was out in the world looking for class and society.
If anybody told me
I'd get myself upset over zinnia...
...gee, I would have thought they was nuts.
Believe it or not,
I worked hard over them flowers.
And I did all the work myself.
I dug up that patch. I raked it, planted the seeds, watered them...
...pulled out the weeds.
And when the flowers started to grow...
...gee, I got a kick like I never had before.
But you can't change a guy overnight.
I'm such a mug that was taught to look for angles.
Take things easy and you live a little longer.
So a couple of weeks ago,
I asked this kid to work for me.
And I thought I was being awful smart.
I guess...
I guess I wasn't so smart.
You may all retire.
When the heart speaks, Brother Orchid...
...other hearts must respond.
We're going to forget everything that happened.
Are we?
Tomorrow morning, this will be a closed incident.
By the way, how much did you say you owe the boy?
Fifty cents.
The world moves on.
Twenty years ago, for exactly the same work, I paid only a quarter.
What's wrong, Brother Orchid?
Are you ill?
No, I'm all right. I'm all right.
"Florence Addams, popular nightclub owner...
...announced that she would marry
Clarence P. Fletcher...
...wealthy Midwestern rancher, next week.
Miss Addams was reported to be fiancée of Little John Sarto, gang leader...
...who is believed slain but whose body has never been discovered."
Oh, so I'm a dead pigeon, huh?
"'Well, never in my life,'
Miss Addams told reporters...
'... have I been so thrilled and happy."'
Oh, Brother Superior, will you do me a favor?
Why, certainly, what is it?
Look, I've always wanted to know how the selling part is run.
How's about taking me to the market with you?
Let me see.
Yes, you've been with us long enough.
I think you've earned a trip to the city. Get in.
Thanks.
[STARTING ENGINE]
You've barely spoken all the way in,
Brother Orchid.
Is the trip thrilling you as much as that?
No, I ain't thrilled.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
- Look, I'm getting out here.
- Wait, where...?
I can't tell you. I haven't got time.
I'll meet you here...
...then I'll tip you off to everything.
- But, Brother Orchid, wait.
[DOORBELL BUZZING]
- Oui, monsieur?
- Oui, yourself. Let me in.
Don't stand there ogling.
Where's your boss?
Madame is at the beauty salon.
Whom shall I say called?
Don't say anybody called. I'm waiting.
- Thank you very much.
- Go on now, beat it.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
It's me, Little John.
Johnny...
...is it really you?
You ain't dead.
Well, if I am,
I'm the livest corpse you ever seen.
Come on, get up.
I got things to say.
I ain't gonna waste time.
Johnny, it feels like a guy's jumping rope in my stomach.
Sure. That's the way all squealers feel when they meet the guy they put the finger on.
Look, I don't know what's happened.
One thing I gotta set you straight on right away.
I didn't double-cross you at Fat Dutchy's.
I wanted Jack Buck to make up with you.
He promised me he would if I got you there. I was dumb to believe him.
Yeah? What do you think now,
I'm dumb to believe you?
Oh, Johnny, you gotta believe me.
It's the truth and I can prove it.
Here, read this.
"If the coppers ask any questions, keep your mouth shut about Sarto.
They won't believe you got him...
...to make up with me anymore than Johnny would himself.
Get smart and stay that way."
Jack Buck's handwriting all right.
- You got it?
- Last month...
...when the cops looked for him.
- For?
The Tim O'Hara killing, policy knockoffs and an income tax rep.
If the cops nail him, he'll got a hundred years. Maybe life.
Well, well, well.
So Jack Buck's on the lam, huh?
- Where's he at?
- I don't know.
- Nobody knows his hideout.
- I might know something about that.
Oh, Johnny...
...please don't be mad at me.
I know I did a dizzy thing but I was only trying to help you.
I'm awful glad you're back.
Gee, you don't know how I've missed you.
If you ain't a screwball, there never was one.
Why?
You've missed me so much that tomorrow...
...you're marrying another guy.
- Oh!
Wait a minute, Johnny. When everybody said you was rubbed out, I went to pieces.
Honest, right to pieces.
Clarence was swell to me, really swell.
And later, when he asked me to marry him, I said okay.
But I never said I loved him.
I never said that to nobody but you.
Well, look, will you call the whole thing off with Clarence?
I don't know how he'll feel about it.
He's got some friends here from Montana for the wedding...
...but I got a hunch he'll understand.
- Okay, then listen.
Slip Clarence the news and I'll be back.
We'll get married, shove off for Kansas, where I got Willie the Knife planted.
I'll get back into harness and take over. You with me?
- Oh, am I?
- All right, now. Finish packing, will you?
- I'll be right back.
- Johnny, wait a minute.
- What is it now?
- That outfit you got on.
What did you do, join a convent?
- Certainly not.
- Well, then why are you wearing a wrapper?
Ahh...
Oh.
- I hope I didn't keep you waiting long.
- No, that's all right.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
[MUTTERS]
Sorry I skipped away like that...
...but something happened
I have to take care of right away.
No apologies are necessary,
Brother Orchid.
Yeah, look...
...I gotta get something off my chest and I only hope you won't be sore.
First, I gotta tell you that the last six months of my life...
...were the happiest I've ever known.
- I'm very glad.
I hope you'll continue to be happy with us.
Well, that's... That's what
I'm trying to tell you.
I won't be able to stay with you...
LITTLE JOHN:
What's this?
Ain't you sold the flowers yet?
- What happened?
- That's why I'm so despondent.
Our market is gone.
They won't handle our flowers anymore.
What? Who won't?
- The wholesalers.
- Huh?
As I understand it, we don't belong to the Protective Association.
Protective...?
Did I hear you say
Protective Association?
Yes.
I learned in the city that not a flower can be sold unless it's grown in their nurseries.
I don't know what we're going to do.
I really don't.
Well, what Protective Association is this?
I don't know. It's all so confusing to me.
They did mention the name of some man wanted by the police.
Buck? Jack Buck?
Yes. Yes, that's it.
How did you know?
Well, it come to me in a dream.
Look, Brother Superior. Will you move over to the curb for a minute?
- Please.
- Well.
I'm gonna blab. Then I'm gonna blow.
Now, don't say nothing, just let me talk.
First, stop worrying about them flowers.
You bring them to the market tomorrow.
You'll find that nobody ain't gonna bother you no more.
- I accept your word, my son. But l...
- Now, please, just let me finish.
I...
I can't explain just why.
It wouldn't do any good if I did.
I gotta quit the monastery.
- My son...
- Now, wait.
Now, like I said before...
...I ain't never been so happy.
I never met people like you.
People who think of the other guy.
Forget about themselves.
And I've been living in new world that's been awful swell.
But you know sometimes with a mug like me, your new world, my old world...
...just don't mix up proper.
And I wish I could stay on forever but I can't.
So all I can say is so long and thanks.
Look, I'll send you back this robe as soon as I get some new clothes.
- Well, thanks for everything.
- But, my brother. Brother.
MEN [SINGING]:
Close your sleepy eyes
My little Buckaroo
While the light of Western skies
Is shining down on you
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
Don't you know it's time for bed
- Where's your boss?
- In the library with Monsieur Fletcher.
So go to sleep
My little Buckaroo
[MEN LAUGH]
[SINGING CONTINUES]
- Johnny.
- I'd be here sooner...
...only I had trouble promoting this suit from a friend.
- Oh, am I butting in?
- That's all right, Mr. Sarto.
We were just talking about you.
What we got to say I reckon we can say to your face.
- You told him?
- Look, Johnny...
...why don't you let me and him alone a few minutes.
Florence has told me everything,
Mr. Sarto.
I've come to realize you must have a powerful wrong impression of me.
Yeah?
How's that?
I always believed you thought
I was a pretty good fella.
Now I realize you also thought
I was awful dumb.
Now, wait a minute, Clarence.
Johnny didn't never say no such thing.
Certainly, I didn't.
I never said anything about you.
- Never even thought anything about you.
- You proved that...
...when you walk in here and expect me to call off my marriage.
Oh, so that's it, huh?
So you think I'm cutting you out?
Let me tell you.
Flo's been my girl for years.
We're always gonna get married, it wasn't in the cards.
You was the one who come along and butted in.
Am I right?
Is that right, Florence?
Is that the way you feel?
I've always loved Johnny, Clarence.
I've got to call it the way I see it.
I'm sorry I kicked up my heels the way I did, Mr. Sarto.
I was just proud enough to believe
I could make Florence happy.
Now I'm just humble enough to realize you're the man to do it...
...and to wish you both all the good luck in the world.
Well, shake.
You're okay.
Say, you got class too.
Can you imagine what I could've done with him in the organization, huh?
Hey, wait a minute.
- What, Johnny?
- Gee, I got an idea. Look...
...those guys outside, are they your pals?
My closest. They've come in town to see my wedding.
- I don't know what they're gonna do.
- Look...
...if they want excitement, I'll dish it.
I wanna knockdown to them.
You wait here a minute.
[MEN LAUGHING]
Boys, I want you to shake hands with Mr. Sarto.
- This is Tex Pearson. Curley Matthews.
- Howdy.
- This here is Buffalo Burns.
- How do you do?
- Glad to know you.
- Mr. Sarto's a good friend of mine.
- Him and Florence...
- Let me do the talking.
- I wanna proposition these mugs.
BUFFALO: Proposition?
LITTLE JOHN:
It's like this, see?
I just come from a monastery.
I'm only in there on a rain check and I want to take a powder. But I can't.
They're in trouble. I don't wanna leave them that way.
- What particular brand of trouble, Mr. Sarto?
- It's like this, see?
These guys at the monastery sell flowers.
The dough they make, they give away to the poor.
That's mighty handsome.
- Mighty.
- Well, I just found out...
...that some mugs are gonna make it tough for them.
They ain't gonna let them sell their flowers unless they shell out.
- Maybe not even then.
- Why don't the fellas in the monastery...
...do something?
- Well, they can't, see.
They're quiet, peaceful little guys that wouldn't hurt a bug.
They can't fight.
And they ain't got the dough to pull strings.
Too bad we ain't got these hombres to home.
We'd sure know what to do with them.
Yeah. We wouldn't even bother the sheriff.
We'd ride them out of town.
We don't waste much time with bad men, Mr. Sarto.
Takes almost half a day to bring a man into court. That's a powerful waste of time.
Powerful.
Well, cheer up then.
I'll give you guys a chance to settle this in your own way.
You mean we can run those tough boys out of town?
You hit it right on the button, pal.
I know where they're hiding out and I'm going there.
Are you guys with me?
[ALL CHEERING]
- I got a little something to attend to.
- I know. I heard you talking inside.
You're headed for trouble. And I'm scared.
What kind of malarkey is this?
It ain't no malarkey.
It's that I don't want nothing to spoil what's coming true after all these years.
That's why I'm scared, Johnny.
Because I'm awful stuck on you.
When you speak like that you're knocking at
Johnny Sarto's heart with a sledgehammer.
Don't you worry.
I'll be back before you know it.
- How does that make you feel?
- I'll tell you on the train.
Here's the elevator, Mr. Sarto.
Johnny, wait a minute.
I want you to carry this with you.
- What is it?
- It's a rabbit's foot, a lucky charm.
My uncle wore it for 32 years.
It's good luck, huh?
- Where'd you get it?
- My mother.
With her hands she took it off my uncle after they hung him.
- Come on, Mr. Sarto! Time's a-wasting.
LITTLE JOHN: All right.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
- Who is it?
- Mr. Clarence Fletcher.
Clarence Fletcher? Anybody know him?
Not me.
We're closed. Come back in the morning.
I've got an important message.
I reckon you'd like to have it tonight.
- What do you say?
- Let him in.
What have we got to be afraid of?
- Howdy.
- Well, well, well.
Look who's here.
Remember him? Pattonsville Sanitarium.
Why, certainly.
Certainly, I remember him.
- You fellows look kind of familiar, at that.
- Sure we do.
Come right in, Mr. Fletcher.
Boy, are we glad to see you.
Yeah.
Remember what you did to us last time?
Yipeee!
[BLOWS LANDING]
Keep punching them, cowboy.
- Okay, Buck, come on out.
JACK: Get them up.
You knew just where I was hiding.
You made a mistake.
Not as big as you're liable to make.
You were lucky last time but you ain't gonna be now.
[LAMP BREAKS]
[MEN GRUNTING]
[BUZZER SOUNDING]
[ALARM BLARING]
[ALARM BLARING]
Right in there, boss.
- All right. Break it up, pal.
- Hey, come on.
- Come on.
- Hold it, now. Break it up!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Mr. Sarto, he went in there.
- You said someone came in here?
- Mr. Sarto did. He was after Jack Buck.
- Are you sure?
- Why, I saw him.
[CLICK]
- He came right through...
- Hey, wait, look.
If you want Jack Buck, go in and get him.
Are you all right, Mr. Sarto?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.
You and me gotta go and talk to Flo.
I... I don't think I better go up there,
Mr. Sarto.
After all, there isn't very much that I can say to Florence anymore.
Now, wait a minute, Clarence.
You know, coming up here in the cab
I been thinking a lot.
You're the guy going up to see Flo.
- I'm breezing along.
- Yeah?
Sure.
Look, pal. You turned out to be a real guy in my book, so I'm gonna let down my hair.
I ain't been on the level with Flo. Never.
What are you saying, Mr. Sarto?
Oh, she's a good dame, and all that.
All the love I got for her, you could stick in your eye.
- I don't get you at all.
- Oh, I'm on the level.
All this talk about me wanting to marry her is a lot of canal water.
Man alive.
You know, to such a guy like me...
...love is like a scratch on the back.
Sometimes feels good.
But a guy can't go along all his life with an itch.
Florence is gonna take this awful hard.
No, she ain't.
Because you're gonna be the guy to tell her.
You know, between us...
...I was gonna take her to Kansas, get a grand out of her, then ditch her.
That'd be a pretty cheap thing to do, wouldn't it?
Yeah, sure.
That's why I changed my mind.
I'm gonna hop a freight and go away by myself. I got a friend there. I'll do all right.
If it's a question of money, maybe I can help out.
Yeah, you sure could, pal.
- If you could let me have a couple of Cs.
- Sure. You bet
How much is a couple of Cs?
Two hu... Three hundred dollars.
- Here you are.
- Thanks, pal.
- Now go on up and do your stuff.
- Oh.
It might be easier on her if you sent some little message.
Something nice about her
I could say you said.
What are you trying to do, coax me to be a hypocrite?
Now, go on up there quick before I change my mind. Still clip her for a couple of grand.
CLARENCE:
Twelfth floor.
Look, mum. Got any kids?
No.
I ain't got nothing.
Well, you got something now.
Brothers...
...there is good cause to be thankful this morning.
I have just received the good news that there is no longer a Protective Association...
...and that we may again sell our flowers in the city.
How this was accomplished,
I cannot tell you.
All I know is that Brother Orchid gave me his word it would be done...
...and it was done.
As you know, Brother Orchid is no longer among us.
He has chosen the outside world.
And none of us is wise enough to say that we are right and he is wrong.
All we can do in our humble way...
...is to wish him the utmost of health...
...and the happiness and throughout our...
Brother Orchid.
Have you changed your mind?
Yeah.
Brother Superior...
...all my life I'm such a guy that was looking for class.
I went halfway around the world trying to find it...
...I thought that class came in dough and nice clothes and society.
Well, I was wrong.
I sure traveled a long way to find out one thing:
This...
...this is the real class.
[ENGLISH SDH]
- That's a monkey, Jake.
- Yeah.
I missed him, anyway. I'd hate to have hit him by mistake for a Jap.
- Let's go, boys.
- What?
Yeah. We're movin' out again.
Too bad we can't quit retreatin' and make a stand this time.
Yes, it is too bad.
We've already moved half way down the Bataan Peninsula.
- We can't back up further.
- Not without gettin' our feet wet.
Sergeant, you and Corporal Feingold are to report to Captain Lassiter...
...of the 26th Calvary about the special duty you volunteered for.
Better get started.
It won't seem like the same war without you around in my outfit.
I heard any place you're at, it's the same war.
It's not right when the infantry takes orders from the calvary.
That's because you're prejudiced.
Wound?
Bunion.
Maybe we ought to take this thing along with us, huh, Jake?
I think you got somethin' there, Sarge.
It saved our lives this time.
Soldier!
Holy Mack!
If that stuff had blown up, it would've knocked those planes out of the sky.
I get your point.
That's Captain Lassiter over there in front of the hospital.
Wait.
So long. See you down south somewhere.
- So long, Lieutenant.
- Good luck, boys.
- You in on this too, Soldier?
- Yeah, I guess I am.
Do you know this Captain Lassiter?
No, I don't. You see, us engineers don't mix much with the cavalry.
By the time they get here we're usually gone, and vice versa.
- Captain Lassiter?
- Yeah?
Sergeant Bill Dane, 31st Infantry.
Reporting for duty.
Private Francis Xavier Matowski,
3rd Engineer Battalion.
Corporal Jake Feingold.
4th Chemical Company.
Feingold?
Excuse me a minute, Captain.
Feingold, I can't see your name on the list.
- Lost my squad, Captain.
Hitched up with the 45th, and got shot loose from that outfit.
So, here I am.
I got a little tired of bein' an orphan.
If the Captain's got any work,
I'd sure like to get it.
He served four hitches with the regulars.
All right, we can use you.
You join up with the patrol in the grove.
Up the slope, against the cliffs.
That will be our center of operations.
Good spot. You men better get on over there.
Okay, Sergeant.
- I asked for my own sergeant, naturally.
- Yeah.
A sniper got him a couple of hours ago.
I wish I knew you better, Sergeant.
This is the first time I've met the Captain.
Well, so we start even.
What's your record?
Two enlistments, no serious demerits.
Takes handling, it says in the company book.
I got out of West Point in '40.
We'll get along.
Our orders are to demolish this bridge to prevent a breakthrough.
Our job to keep the Japs from moving their tanks and artillery here.
Stop 'em any way we can.
- For how long?
- For as long as we can.
The idea is General MacArthur needs time to reorganize...
...and consolidate down below.
If the Japs can flank our main army by pouring heavy stuff...
...through this pass, the Battle of Bataan's going to be all over too soon.
That's our patrol, Sergeant, over there in that grove.
We've got some natural advantages.
Being up on that shelf ought to give us some protection.
That cliff at the back ought to help us a lot.
Here's the detail.
Any of the names familiar?
Yeah, a few of 'em.
Well, they're a mixed crew.
All experts in their own line.
They've never served together before.
This assignment isn't going to be easy on anybody, Sergeant.
Are you satisfied?
Can you handle the men?
Well, if the Captain thinks so.
We'll get along.
Oh, Captain!
Captain Lassiter!
What'd you do with your plane?
She's in the grove, all stowed away and camouflaged.
Lieutenant Bentley,
5th Interceptor Command.
This is Corporal Katigbak,
Philippine Army Air Force.
They'll be staying with us for now till we get our ship in the air, and if.
The Lieutenant'll want to borrow two men to help work on his ship.
Better check the patrol now.
How'd you like to draw them in a raffle?
''Are any of the names familiar to you,
Sergeant?'' says the Captain.
What difference does it make what their names are?
Three months ago they were all selling shoes or punching adding machines.
Do you see a soldier in that lot?
I said ''soldier.''
You can't always tell.
Some of those kids learn pretty good.
Kind of quick.
My name's Dane. Bill Dane.
You can call me Sergeant.
That'll be easy to remember.
All right, fall in over here.
I said, fall in!
At ease.
We'll have a few minutes to organize before the Japs send their planes.
When they report back, we'll have a little more time to get organized.
So, let's get organized.
Sound off, Sailor.
Name and classification.
Name's Leonard Purckett. Musician,
2nd Class, United States Navy, sir.
We don't say ''sir'' to sergeants in the Army, Sailor.
How'd you get here?
I started from Cavite by boat but the Japs laid a few eggs on the boat...
...so what there was left of us swum.
I kind of lost the other boys somewheres...
...and then, first thing I knowed,
I was here in the Army.
I joined the Navy to see the world.
Reckon this is still part of it.
Fine. We want to know all the interesting facts about you.
Well, sir, before I joined the Navy
I was an usher in a movie...
...and played in our town band. And...
...this here's my cornet.
I'm glad you brought that.
Where are the rest of your sidearms?
- Hang 'em onto you.
- Yes, sir. I mean, Sergeant.
Yankee Salazar, Private,
4th Engineer Battalion, Philippine Scouts.
It seems to me I saw you box somewhere.
Maybe Thanksgiving,
Manila Olympics Club?
I fight the windup.
Knocked him out in the fourth.
Yeah, I was there.
You did a nice, handy job.
Matthew Hardy, Private.
12th Medical Battalion.
Felix Ramirez, Private.
Provisional Tank Corps.
- National Guard?
- Yeah.
192nd Tank Battalion...
...California.
Wesley Eeps, Private.
3rd Engineer Battalion.
You're quite a hand at demolition.
Had no complaints from officers.
We got the explosives necessary to fix the bridge?
Private Matowski and me made a special collection.
We didn't get time for signed requisitions for some of what we collected, Sarge.
As long as you collected enough right stuff there'll be no kick out of me.
You men served together quite awhile?
- Only since December 1.
- Where are you from?
Pittsburgh, Pa. And I sure will be glad to get back.
Malloy, Sam.
Motor Transport Service.
Cook.
Present.
Corporal Jake Feingold,
4th Chemical Company, U.S.A.
Barney Todd, Corporal,
Provisional Signal Battalion.
Todd?
Yeah, Todd. T-o-d-d, two d's.
How long you been in?
I enlisted in San Francisco,
February 5, 1941.
Volunteered for duty in the Philippines,
September 11, 1941.
Anything else you'd like to know?
I'm sure Captain Lassiter can tell you.
I was attached to his troop in Lingayen.
Relax. That's reconnaissance, not bombers.
Patrol present and accounted for.
All right, Sergeant.
Give the men their orders.
We're going to blow that bridge.
When the Japs get here, they'll try to rebuild it.
We'll keep on blowing it up.
This is where we stay.
Got good cover.
It'll be hard to get at us.
We can do a lot of harm to the Japs when they come out in the open.
We got lots to do and little time.
Step out as I call your names.
Hardy! Malloy! Get that stuff stored away then break out your entrenching tools.
Strengthen defenses as and where you can.
Feingold! Salazar! Set the machine guns up. Train 'em to cover the bridge.
Shoot at anything that moves.
Todd, Eeps, Matowski, Ramirez...
Pack that demolition stuff down at the bridge, on the double!
Purckett!
Get in the way as little as possible.
Put that gear on!
- How long have you been out here?
- About two years.
I've been here four months.
Anytime you get an idea while we're together on this job...
...give your orders to the men.
You don't have to waste time asking me first...
...tryin' to make me look good.
And anytime I give an order that sounds wrong to you, tell me why.
We'll get things done better and easier that way.
That sounds fine to me, Captain.
Todd?
Yeah?
First hitch in the Army?
I was a little young for World War I.
You could've made it.
You keep reminding me...
...of a guy I knew a few years back right after I joined up.
Yeah?
His name was Burns.
Burns?
Yeah, Dan Burns, or so he said then.
He was a corporal.
Same as me.
Yeah, same as you.
I don't think that's healthy, Corporal...
...smoking close to the stuff we just scattered around here.
That'll worry me? What you think?
Get rid of it!
- All right, men, clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge!
Hey, Sarge, whatever become of this guy you say I look like?
I'd like to know.
Sooner or later I'll find out.
I'll personally see to it that he stands up on a parade-ground scaffold and hangs.
- Like he should've done seven years ago.
- What'd he do?
Killed a boy who took him in a stud game, buck private in our outfit.
Shot him in the back.
I had the MP detail right then, so I took this Burns in charge.
That was a break for him.
I felt kind of sorry for him, same as
I would for any soldier who gets in a jam.
He double-crossed me, went over the hill.
That's too bad.
Yeah.
Yeah, his getaway cost me my stripes and my chance for Officers' School.
You got quite a little against him.
Enough.
He probably knows that.
Sure he does.
Well, you know...
...if I was you...
...and this... Burns?
- Burns.
If he comes around me again,
I'd look out for him.
I figure to.
He's liable to try to knock you off to keep you from turnin' him in.
I don't know. His kind, as long as you don't turn your back on him...
...they don't do a thing.
Well, then you're okay.
That's what I figure.
- Check the lines?
- Yeah, they're okay.
Hold it, Todd!
Sergeant, the men better not drink this water till I chlorinate it in the Lister-bags.
All right, no drinking from this.
Make sure there's always plenty of purified water available.
What's the matter? Those nasty little Japs poison our water by remote control?
They don't need to. There are enough germs in this stuff to poison the lot of us.
You heard the orders?
Yeah, you're easy to hear, Sarge.
All set, Captain.
All right.
Solid!
- Good job.
- Yeah.
We must have enough fire power to keep them from rebuilding that bridge.
That depends.
On how long we stay here?
We'll stay as long as any of us can stand up.
We may get orders to withdraw very soon, and we may not.
I think we'll be able to do our share.
That's all anybody's asking of us.
We can make this place fairly comfortable.
So relax, men, and get some rest while you can.
Cease firing, Sailor!
Hold your fire till you've got a target!
Eeps, Hardy, get your shovels.
Take positions. Don't fire without orders.
I don't think there are enough Jap snipers to rush us this soon, but there might be.
All right, get going.
Keep your heads down or you'll get 'em knocked off.
See what I mean?
Yankee, get over with the Sailor.
He needs you more than Feingold.
Better hurry that up.
Can't hurry too much putting a soul underground, Sergeant.
Hey, Todd!
They're out there, not over here.
Listen, you guys...
...what happened over there was no accident!
You better know right now those no-tail baboons out there are ichiban jozu.
Meaning No. 1 Skillful.
They climb trees better than monkeys.
Got the best trees marked on their maps.
They can live and fight for a month on what wouldn't last one of you two days!
All I want to do is get me a Jap.
Just one Jap.
I wish something would move.
- You better make him last.
- Oh, gum, I got plenty of.
Look, I'll be back in a minute.
If you see any Japs, save one for baby, will ya?
Japs, we got plenty of.
There ought to be a cross, hadn't there?
I could make one.
Yeah, do that.
I got chalk too, if you'd want me to print the Captain's name and rank on the cross.
All right, Sailor.
Medical Corps' duty to check effects and belongings before burial.
Didn't they tell you that was part of your job?
Here's his stuff.
Put it in your report that Captain Lassiter was married.
- Cigarette, Sergeant?
- Thanks.
- You and the Captain were...
- Yeah.
You ever run across a little nurse out here named Elsie MacAlester?
Yeah, I put her on that last
Red Cross truck going out.
I had a date with her once in Manila.
She was a nice kid...
...from Kansas.
I sent her a Spanish shawl for Christmas but I don't suppose she ever got it.
Guess the Japs got that when they grabbed the Manila Post Office.
She and Captain Lassiter were married yesterday.
Supposed to be a secret.
Guess he had to tell somebody.
Didn't she know any better?
What do you think you're gonna do with that?
I thought it'd be the right thing if I'd blow taps for the Captain.
It might be if this was Arlington Cemetery.
Forget it. I said forget it.
Here, put that on your noggin and glue it there.
What's on your minds?
Well, I think somebody ought to at least say a few words.
All right. Speak your piece.
Not me, Sergeant.
Eeps here can do it better.
You a preacher back home?
I was studying to be, Sergeant.
All right.
Heavenly Father...
...Captain Lassiter was our captain...
...and he was a good captain.
He did his job and kept on doing it as long as he could.
He died a long ways from home.
His folks probably won't ever know where we buried him.
But we reckon he was prepared for that.
As long as we know that what comes out of graves...
...is the best part of what goes into them...
...we know he's all right.
''Blessed are the pure in heart...
''...for they shall see God.''
Amen.
Amen.
All right, break it up.
Here you are, Malloy.
Where I come from, you only take medicine when you're sick.
As long as the quinine lasts, it may keep you from getting sick with malaria.
Taste bad?
Not when it's in a capsule.
The Sergeant sure is a hard man, ain't he?
I'll bet you could strike matches on the back of his neck.
According to history, wars are started by corporals and won by sergeants.
I claim they're won by everybody that puts on a uniform and gets shot at.
When a good man like the Captain gets killed...
...I don't see why the Sergeant won't let me blow taps.
It'd be just the decent thing to do.
Look, kid...
...blow your horn all you want to.
I like a good tune on the horn, myself.
But there'll be no taps.
Those monkeys know what ''taps'' means and I don't want 'em keeping score on us.
- You got it clear in your mind now?
- Yes, sir, Sergeant. I got it.
The Sergeant's a sensible fellow at that.
Just have to get to know him, that's all.
That'll take you a long time, Junior.
Lieutenant?
Yes, Sergeant?
You want to pick your men now, or shall I?
I think you better give the orders,
Sergeant.
You see, I'm just a stowaway on this trip.
Until and if I can get my plane in the air,
I'll take orders from you like the rest.
Isn't that the best way to handle it?
I wouldn't say no.
Doesn't make sense though, a $40,000 pilot getting killed in the infantry.
I hadn't exactly figured on gettin' killed.
Go ahead, Sarge.
You pick 'em and I'll kibitz.
Any of you guys claim to be mechanics?
Hey, Sarge, back home I built my own jalopy.
Everything is strictly out of secondhand junk...
...but, boy, he goes 80 miles an hour like nothing.
I didn't finish telling you, Sarge.
Before I was an usher and played in the band, I done some work in a garage.
You've been a busy boy.
Well, yeah, I got around some.
- Think they'll do, Lieutenant?
- Fine.
I'll need you later.
I'll yell for you when I'm ready.
Now listen, you guys,
I'm gonna make a speech.
We'll make it my first and my last.
Some of you might not like the way
I wear my tin hat or somethin'.
Well, I didn't pick you either.
As long as nobody changes
Captain Lassiter's orders...
...the orders stand the way you heard 'em.
You all volunteered, or you wouldn't be here...
...so we'll call off the volunteering from now on.
Gonna be a lot of odd jobs to be done around here.
Some dirty jobs.
I'll decide what's to be done and when, and
I'll pick the men to do it. That'll be that.
Don't all of you be stepping up, making your pitch for a medal volunteering.
It'll just waste my time and yours.
The smartest thing you can do is to take it easy. Don't get excited.
If you got nothing to do, write letters.
I'm glad you mentioned that, Sergeant.
I've been sayin' all along that we ought to write home oftener.
You're right, Sailor.
You're dead right.
That's what we oughta do.
Those poor civilians are havin' a tough time...
...havin' to give up their gas and tires and sugar...
...and havin' to buy bonds.
We gotta keep up their morale.
Thanks for giving us your views on the subject, Corporal.
Now get this straight and don't forget it:
If one of you lays down on the job he's assigned to...
...he'll put the rest of you right on the spot.
Don't let that happen.
You're in charge of ammunition and ordinance.
How many grenades and how much dynamite we got?
- Give me a report before you go off duty.
- Okay, Sarge.
Hardy, start issuing regular preventive doses of quinine to each man immediately.
- I already have, sir.
- That's fine. How's the supply?
About enough for four days, minimum dosage.
Malloy, how are the groceries?
The groceries?
I'll tell you, there ain't no sugar for the coffee...
...and there ain't no coffee.
There's maggots in the meat, and the meat is mule.
Mule?
Yeah, mule.
If you hold your nose, it's all right.
Issue plenty for tonight.
Start rationing tomorrow.
I'll do that.
All right, boys, come and get it.
Any action out there?
I ain't seen nothin', and I ain't heard nothin'.
But you can bet they're out there, thicker'n fleas on a hound dog in Georgia.
What's the matter, Sarge?
You in a hurry?
I can wait.
Thought I might relieve Eeps here while he gets his chow.
That is, if it's okay with you.
Thank you, Lieutenant, but I don't feel hungry now...
...but Matowski over yonder, he's always ready to eat.
- I'll send Matowski in.
- Thanks, Lieutenant.
I never touch the stuff.
Don't tell me that's Jap jive!
No, Sarge, no.
That's good old America.
That's U.S.A.
Well, music with our meals! Fancy.
That's Tommy Dorsey, from Hollywood!
He sends me, Sarge!
He makes me lace up my boots!
Oh, brother!
Keep blowing, Tommy, keep blowing.
Oh, boy, he's tall tonight, he's tall.
Yeah, talk to me, talk to me.
Give me some of that trombone talk,
Tommy.
Sarge, what's a man do when he gets took with remorse?
- That depends on what about.
- About this.
I knew a mule, used to beat his ears down, and for all I know this is him.
He's getting even with you?
That's why I got remorse.
I toughened that mule too much.
Some day I'm going to get back to Pittsburgh.
Every Monday my mom makes lima bean soup with vinegar.
Get him. He can mention a mess like that and turns his nose up at this.
Which one of you guys claims to be any good at climbing trees?
Come on.
Which tree, Sarge?
Pick a tall one. Get as high up as you can.
It's too dark to see, but I got a hunch...
...a big concentration of Jap heavy stuff is over there across the ravine by now.
See what you can spot.
Yep.
That's two.
Purckett, Ramirez, front and center.
Relieve Todd on No. 1 machine gun.
On your feet. Grab a weapon and get in one of those foxholes.
Break out the tommy guns.
Jake, issue each of them a couple of pineapples.
Don't let these drop on your foot.
Yeah, they are heavy.
The idea is to use 'em. Don't waste 'em.
- You ever handle one of these before?
- We never had any of these in our outfit.
You pull this, this and the gun'll do the rest.
Except in case when it jams.
- What if it jams?
- Write a letter to your senator.
If anything breaks, I suggest you get back there as fast as possible.
Right.
You two, go with the Corporal.
If the moon gets higher the Japs'll see you, so space out ten feet apart. Hug the cliff.
Don't shoot unless you're shot at.
All right, get going.
If anything breaks up, don't let it interfere with your work unless we yell for help.
- Right, Sergeant, good luck to you.
- Thanks.
You and me are going for a walk.
Yeah?
This guy, Burns, I was tellin' you about...
...he used to pitch for Company A.
Had quite a hop on his fast one.
No foolin'?
Have you had any experience throwin' these apples?
Yeah, I been in the Army awhile.
That'll save me havin' to show you how.
Yankee, reverse the gun over there where the bridge was.
Better have an extra belt ready.
You men...
...Corporal Feingold here is in full command until I get back.
You gotta go lookin' for trouble?
You'd better check with Lieutenant Bentley before you make any move. That's in case.
Okay, Sarge.
When we start layin' these eggs, fire at will to cover us.
We'll angle over to the right.
It's good cover down that way.
Then we'll work back up along the edge of the ravine as far as we can.
All right, come on.
Go ahead, Sarge.
This guy, Burns, used to toss 'em left-handed.
Is that so?
You know...
...that's a funny thing.
I'm a southpaw myself.
- Hold it!
- But they need us up yonder!
The Sergeant'll sing out when he needs us!
Get back on the job.
Sulfanilamide powder and a piece of adhesive tape.
How bad's he hurt?
Lost a quarter of an inch of heel.
Well, that he can spare.
We're like ducks in a shootin' gallery.
Do you suppose those guys might get discouraged and call this party off, Sarge?
No, they'll snipe us by daytime and paste that bridge together by night...
...until it's across.
They don't get discouraged.
They got plenty of time.
Yep, they set the clock.
What's the matter, Sarge?
I'm wonderin' how long these guys can stand up to this stuff.
They've done all you told 'em, neat and proper so far.
They haven't been here long yet.
If they were real soldiers, Jake, it'd be different.
The way it is, I'm wondering if headquarters wouldn't say...
...we did good enough even if I ordered to pack up and get out of here tonight.
We could be a long ways by morning, associating with a better class of people!
I don't think you'll give any kind of an order like that.
Those kids signed up for this just like you and me.
They'll get tired, sure.
Things'll get tough, sure.
But they won't put their tails between their legs...
...and run any more than you would.
What do you think you're doing?
Plenty Japs over there, tanks, artillery.
I go tell General MacArthur.
He sends planes...
...planes drop bombs on Japs!
Bang! Fourth of July!
I can make it, Sarge.
I know this piece of country all over.
- Born around here?
- Oh, no.
I'm Moro from Mindanao, but when I am little kid...
...my old man is traveling salesman for sewing machines.
This piece of country very good territory for him.
I go along to keep the dough for my mom.
Because when my pop drinks the coconut, he's loco in the coco.
They got a dollar down, dollar when you catch 'em, even here.
One dollar down, you bet.
If the collector has to catch you...
...no more coco!
I come from onetime very murdering family, Sergeant.
- So long. See you in the funny paper.
- Wait.
Get your clothes on and get civilized again.
Somebody got to go tell the General.
That'll do a lot of good, tellin' the General.
What's the matter, Mister?
Look, Joe, the General ain't got any planes.
He ain't gonna get any.
If I was you, I wouldn't say that.
I reckon the U.S. Is sendin' help as best as they can, as fast as they can.
Oh, sure, sure.
Help that don't exist is on the way.
Private, lead us in three rousing cheers!
Sarge, you better bury the rest of us face down...
...so we don't keep lookin' up for the planes that ain't coming!
Sergeant, I gotta bust one of your orders.
Come on, get on your feet, Todd.
Why not?
Might as well get this over right.
At ease!
You spoke your piece.
All right, sit down.
Come on, sit down, both of you!
Yankee...
I hope he gets to talk to the General.
Oh, boy! It sure is a fine, pretty morning, ain't it?
Reminds me of how the sun came up when I was a cowpuncher once...
...out west in Texas.
Of course, we never had none of this kind of fog out there.
That's something else I've done in my past. I punched cattle once.
- What's the matter with you?
- Just tired. Long night we put in.
No, sir. I'm no doctor, but I worked in a drugstore once. You're sick.
Don't you go saying that!
Don't you say that to anybody! I mean it!
What do you want to get mad for?
If a man's sick, he's sick.
It's no disgrace that I know of.
Don't you tell the Sergeant.
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.
It's time to get back.
Get your stuff and let's get movin'.
Yes, sir.
What we've done look all right?
Fine. It's a good night's work.
Is she anywheres near ready to go?
No, not quite yet.
Say, Lieutenant? Lieutenant?
Do you reckon if we was to lay down and cork off awhile...
...the Sarge'd be too put out?
I mean, after we check in.
I'll tell him you did a hard night's work and deserve a little sleep.
I guess us men could use a little rest, couldn't we?
- 'Morning, Sergeant.
- 'Morning, Lieutenant. How'd it go?
Rome wasn't built in a day.
It says in the book.
That was a nice job you did on the bridge.
Yeah, it turned out okay.
Lieutenant.
Sergeant.
These men had kind of a tough night.
I think they could use a little sleep.
All right. Right after inspection.
All right, men. Fall in over here.
All right, front and center. Everybody up.
Jake, you stay on your gun.
How's the heel?
I feel fine. How are you?
Say, Sarge, where's Salazar?
He took a walk.
Now, look, Junior, you got all day to hear the news.
- Sergeant, what about Corporal Katigbak?
- I haven't seen him.
He came back to work on the carburetor.
I sent him in about an hour ago.
As you were, men.
Katigbak!
Hardy!
I'd say he's been dead about... about an hour, Sergeant.
Get back in line. You too, Private.
One thing at a time!
All right, fall in.
- What's the matter with you, Soldier?
- Nothin'. I'm fine.
Hold still.
Coming down with this for days?
No, sir, Sarge.
Well, I had the shivers.
The shivers, then the shakes.
Hot, cold, and hot again.
I've had malaria myself. I know it.
I ain't sick.
Take charge of him.
But I ain't sick, Sergeant.
You need a little rest and some double shots of quinine.
Eeps, Malloy, take care of Katigbak.
You others, get on your guns.
Keep your eyes open.
Purckett, get in with Feingold.
I don't know whether you know it, but that was a Samurai sword, Lieutenant.
- Officer?
- Yeah.
Probably get in close enough so he knows exactly how many men you got left.
Won't be long before they hit you with everything they can get across that ravine.
When'll the plane be ready to take off?
The Corporal and I figured we'd need a few more night's work, but...
...we don't have much time.
Don't crack her up before you're off the ground.
I'll know what the chances are after tonight.
Okay.
Don't seem possible Salazar could have got there so quick.
Depends upon how far he had to go and how fast he traveled.
Yeah, and if he caught up to the General.
What do you want to say that for?
Those are Japs! Everybody down!
Hug the ground!
But I thought them was Japs!
I think they are.
Malloy! Malloy, get back there!
Get down!
Look at that! Malloy got him!
Malloy, I take back everything
I ever thought against you! You're okay!
I told you, Sarge.
That guy's gotta know somethin' better than he knows how to cook!
Hold it.
Back on your guns.
Nothing you can do for him now, Private.
Can't you stay off your feet like I told you to?
I feel much better.
When I want you, I'll let you know!
Now get back into bed and stay there!
Turn your radio on. It might do us all good to hear some music.
But the battery is only good for a few hours.
I wouldn't want to use it up too fast.
It's your radio. Do what you want with it.
Hey, you, I thought I told you to look after him!
What have I got to do, put it in writing?
You're off duty, Sailor.
Jake, take charge of this gun.
Okay.
Sarge!
Sarge! First Jap I've seen, right out there in the open!
He's just standin' there askin' for it!
Okay, Mr. Monkey, you're gonna get it!
No, Sarge, he's my Jap!
That's no Jap!
You got fog in your eyes, Sailor.
Take another look.
That's Salazar.
Yeah.
What's left of him.
The Japs probably got him last night.
Worked on him a long time before they finally strangled him...
...and put him out of his misery.
- Shut up!
Take it easy, Sailor. Relax.
You need a little rest.
Dirty... dirty... dirty... dirty!
Pobre mamaciya...
He's talkin' Spanish. Talkin' of his mother.
Jitterbug kid, shakin' himself to death.
Sergeant.
Sergeant!
Lay still, boy. Lay still.
I'm solid, Sarge...
...honest.
Sure, you are.
Padre Manuel.
Padre Manuel.
Take it easy, Soldier. Take it easy.
Si, Padre, si.
Yes, Father, I remember.
I learned it by heart...
...just like you say.
Thinks he's talkin' to a priest.
''Confiyeor Deo omnipoyenyi...
''...beayae Mariae semper Virgini...
That ain't Spanish now.
''...beayo Michaeli Archangelo...
That's Latin. I taught Latin in high school, back in Kentucky.
''...sancyis Aposyolis Peyro ey Paulo...
''...omnibus sancyis, ey vobis frayres quia...
''...peccavi mimis cogiyayione...''
''I confess that I have sinned exceedingly...
''...in thought, word and deed.
''Through my fault...
''...through my fault...
''...through my most grievous fault.''
- What's the matter, Sergeant?
- Got the same thing he had, haven't you?
Any quinine left?
Gave the last of it to the kid, huh?
That's fine.
According to the papers from the Captain you enlisted as 1-A-0, non-combatant.
Wouldn't kill anybody else.
That's fine. Fine!
Stay in here and take it easy.
You don't have to stand inspection.
Eeps will take care of him.
The kid?
Yeah.
Tell Eeps, will you?
And tell the Sailor when he comes in.
In case he doesn't know how to spell the name.
R- a-m-i-r-e-z.
First name, Felix.
Okay, Sarge.
- 'Morning, Lieutenant.
- 'Morning, Sergeant.
- How's it, Sailor?
- Oh, fine, Sarge.
I got used to workin' nights when I was a cab driver in Kansas City.
'Course, I slept days.
Okay. Go lay down for a while.
Oh, no, Sarge.
No, go on, go on.
Well, okay, if you say so.
How's the plane?
I'll try a takeoff tonight.
Think you'll make it?
Yeah, I think so.
Those Japs know what you've been up to.
No use givin' them too much of a target.
When you're ready, we'll open up from here.
The noise of our firing ought to cover the motors's sound when you take off.
I've got an alternate suggestion, Sergeant.
It seems to me that your patrol has done about all that can be done.
I suggest that you abandon all but necessary equipment.
We'll find some way to stow the men aboard the plane.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
I'd like you to take Private Hardy there.
He needs doctors, medicine, hospital...
You go along too, Sailor.
Me? Oh, no, sir, Sarge!
Those are orders.
I ain't Army, though, Sarge, I'm Navy...
...and I joined up for the duration, which ain't yet.
Besides, I still gotta get me a couple of Japs.
The rest of us had better stay here.
Hey, kid...
...when you get around to fixin'...
It's R-a-m-i...
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
Hey, look...
Well, never mind.
I offered a suggestion, Sergeant.
I'd hate to have to use my rank to make it an order.
I'd hate to have you do that, Lieutenant.
You might get to Corregidor, you might not.
Meanwhile, nobody's told me it's time to let those Japs move through this pass.
- How much longer can you hold on?
- I don't know.
Maybe I oughta call the whole thing off.
Maybe I've done everything wrong.
Maybe this, maybe that...
...but I'm playin' the hand the cards dealt.
The patrol stays here.
Sooner or later they have gotta come out in the open where we can see 'em.
We're gonna be here when they do.
I don't want to pull out of here either...
...but I guess that's the right thing to do.
For you, yeah.
But as I understood it at the beginning, the patrol's my job, the plane's yours.
That still go?
Still goes, Sergeant.
Hey, Sarge?
What? You think you got a first mortgage on this war or somethin'?
Well, I own a piece of it.
Maybe you can stop us from goin' by plane.
Just what do you do if we start walkin'?
The Japs would do it same as to Salazar and Katigbak.
Me, I'm gonna die all in one piece...
...if and when.
Well, maybe the Japs don't worry us as much as they do you.
Walk if you want to, only...
...it says in the book
I tell you when and where to stop.
It also says that if you keep on going,
I let you have it.
Deserting in the face of the enemy.
You'll have to shoot awful fast to stop five guys.
There won't be five!
You're not goin' anyplace, except with me.
When you and I leave, we leave together.
- Now, look...
- Get back on your gun!
You...
I wish there was more moon tonight.
We need the extra light down in the grove.
- Is five minutes enough?
- Yeah, that'll do it.
Start firing at 11:00 on the nose.
Make all the noise you can.
- Better issue me a couple grenades.
- Okay.
- It was nice meeting you, Lieutenant.
- It was nice knowing you too, Sailor.
Well, thanks.
You too. I'll see you some more.
We'll be countin' on that.
Here you are, Sarge.
So long, Lieutenant.
So long, Jake.
Let's go, Hardy.
Come on, kid.
Lay on the bridge.
Come on, kid.
I'm sorry.
Get in there. Here.
And don't fire until I give the order, please.
All set?
They're working down there. Hear 'em?
Busy little beavers, ain't they?
Well, let them have their fun.
In four minutes and 20 seconds...
...we'll break up their party.
It'll be a pleasure, Corporal.
Let's go, Soldier.
Cease firing!
What's the matter with him?
Why don't he take off?
Get in there!
Stay put!
All of you!
- What happened?
- They got the Lieutenant.
He wouldn't let me move him.
He'd fall apart.
Get some dynamite.
- For what?
- Go on, get it.
Purckett, take care of him.
- Where's he hit?
- Just fever.
Todd, you're in charge until we get back.
Stand ready to fire at will.
- What goes on, Sarge?
- Lieutenant's orders. Come on.
Cover us.
Lieutenant, I can't let you do this.
Got to get this ship in the air...
...let 'em have it.
But you may never even get her off the ground.
Got lots to do...
...and not much time left.
Plane's my job, Sarge.
Remember?
Okay, Lieutenant.
Okay.
I wish the Sarge'd get back.
They're working on that bridge again.
Shouldn't we open up on 'em?
Sergeant said, ''Fire at will.''
I want to hit me a Jap and know
I hit him. That's what I want.
- Look, Corporal...
- Shut up, will you?
- Wait a minute, I got a right to ask...
- I said, shut up.
Hey, look at it. Look at it!
Come on, get her off the ground!
Get her up in the air!
He's off! Look!
I should have been in that plane.
I should have been in that plane!
Hey, come back here. Come here!
Come here!
He don't know what he's doing.
He's a sick man. He's delirious.
You can't help him anyway now.
He wouldn't even want you to try.
Don't you know any other songs?
Sure, but I'm partial to the St. Louis blues.
Same as me.
All right, that's deep enough.
Relax, Sailor.
Here, I got one.
Tobacco kind of takes the edge off when a man's hungry, don't it, Corporal?
You can promise your mind, but you gotta deliver somethin' to your stomach...
...even if it's only tobacco smoke.
All right, we'll put one gun here and one over there.
Sight 'em in for interlocking fire across the front.
Okay, Sarge.
You figure they'll come at us today, Sarge?
Well, if I was running their show
I'd figure now's the time.
The way they operate, they put off usin' cold iron till last.
They try everything else first.
They've tried everything else.
Seems like they done give up on that bridge-buildin', don't it?
Well, maybe. That don't mean they won't take care of us.
No, we held 'em up too long.
It kind of sounds like this is it.
This is it, kid.
You've been askin' to see a Jap.
You're probably gonna see a whole mess of them before you're a day older.
Come on, we'll move these guns.
Get goin'.
Yeah?
I might make a deal with you.
You doin' me favors, Sarge?
I did a favor for this Danny Burns once.
Yeah, so you say.
I've been thinkin'...
...if you keep your nose clean...
...if, as in when we get out of here...
...I might have a loss of memory.
Don't forget a thing, Sarge.
I never do.
Todd.
Let go of me!
Sarge!
Hey, Sarge! Sarge!
The trees are movin'! The bushes!
They're walkin'!
Everybody down.
Hold it, Sailor.
Fix bayonets.
Don't anybody move.
Don't make any noise.
They can't see us.
They don't know who's here or how many, not for sure.
Have Japs got whites in their eyes?
We'll find out any minute now, Sailor.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
All right...
...on the count.
One...
...two...
Okay!
Jake.
It's that bunion.
It's murderin' me.
Pull it up.
Hold that.
Hey, Sarge. Could I write a letter?
Yeah.
How are you gonna mail it, kid?
Carrier pigeon?
Hey, Todd.
Yeah?
Tell the Sailor to dictate it and you'll write it.
I didn't join up for a nursemaid.
He's a good kid. He needs to get pulled together for what's comin'.
Help him with that letter.
Don't make it tough for him.
I never make it tough for anybody, Sarge.
Here. I'll give you a hand with that, Sailor.
Thanks.
Gee, thanks, Corporal.
Who to?
''Dear Mum.'' M-u-m.
I call my mother Mum.
That's new and different.
''Dear Mum.
''This letter may never reach you...
''...but I want to write it while I can.
''There were 13 of us when we got to where we are...
''...and now there's only three of us left.
''There's the Sergeant...
''...and Corporal Todd and myself.
''Corporal Todd's writing this for me.
''I happened to hurt my hand kind of.
''Maybe there won't be any of us ever to get outta here alive.''
Rub that out.
''It's too bad some of the other men
I came here with had to get killed.
''Maybe it don't seem to do an awful lot of good...
''...a few men gettin' killed holding on to some place you never heard of...
''...probably never will...
''...but we figure...''
Wait a minute. Give me a chance.
''But we figure the men who died here...
''...may have done more than we'll ever know...
''...to save this whole world.
''It's like Corporal Juan Katigbak said...''
- Did you hear him when he told me?
- Yeah.
''He said, 'It don't matter where a man dies...
'''... as long as he dies for freedom.'''
Okay so far?
Sure, Sarge, sure.
''The rest of us are gonna get outta here.''
That's right, Sailor.
''And I'll be home before you know it...
''...so don't you worry none about me.
''Say hello to my girl...''
What's her name?
Marie.
Make that, ''Give my love to Marie.''
Anything else?
No, Sarge, that's all.
Oh, just...
''Thanks for being my family.
Your loving son, Len.''
My name's Leonard, but she calls me Len.
- You got an envelope?
- No.
I'll mail it when I get to Corregidor.
Yeah. That all?
Yeah. Get back on No. 3.
Hey, Sarge, do you mind if I turn on the radio?
Yeah, it might be a good idea.
Wish I'd brung a slot machine.
Boy, they shower down gum.
If Ramirez was still here, I bet he'd be trying for Tommy Dorsey from Hollywood.
Be kind of cheerful, huh?
I'm getting something.
- Americans!
- Don't know what.
Filipinos! You are beayen.
This is Japan's lasy warning yo you all.
Lay down your arms.
Surrender now, at once.
You will be yreayed kindly, wiyh chivalry...
...according yo yhe rules of Japanese bushido.
Bushido! Bushwah! You stink!
It's you and me now, Sarge.
We've been heading for that for a long time.
The Sailor was standing right behind that tree.
Sniper couldn't have got him. Couldn't have even seen him from over there.
One of those monkeys is still alive, playin' possum.
Maybe more than one.
The question is which?
One way of findin' out.
Spray the batch of them.
You got somethin' there.
Come on, let's take a look.
Don't do me any favors, Sarge.
I guess this just ain't your day, huh, Sarge?
You could have swindled yourself a nice, shiny medal...
...takin' me back and stuck a rope around my neck.
I never figured I'd bump into you again.
I told you I'd have a loss of memory.
Far as I'm concerned, your name is Todd.
It's Burns.
Dan Burns.
Danny Burns...
...Corporal, 31st Infantry, killed in action.
You know, Sarge...
...I began to have a little respect for you.
For a second back there, I thought it was you that stuck that chiv in my back...
...and... and not the Jap.
Come on. Come on and get it!
Come on! Come and get it!
Come on, suckers!
What's the matter with you?
What are you waitin' for?
Didn't think we were here, did you?
You dirty rotten rats!
We're still here! We'll always be here!
Why don't you come and get it?
Fair seat, bad hands, mount not sufficiently schooled.
Disqualified.
Here comes the California cockerel
Ten pesos he clears 'em all.
Cleanly? Taken.
Grow wings, my friend.
Ten pesos, if you please.
Maybe you've forgotten that in California they use horses for cradles.
- Well done, señor. Excellent.
- And all I did was sit on his back.
Three carrots after his oats tonight.
- You go to an affair of the court?
- No, of the heart.
- Something is wrong.
- The face, man. The face...
Why the fine feathers?
A señorita that would put St Anthony on the griddle. We're to meet in...
Have you forgotten that you cross swords with Lieutenant Cortez at three o'clock?
It slipped my mind.
Why do I have to meet every swordsman in Madrid?
Everybody enjoys a certain amount of fighting, but why do they all pick on me?
Calm yourself. It's become a distinction to assail a California cockerel.
You pink them slightly in the arm or shoulder and they boast of having met you.
Cadet Vega, the commandant wishes to see you in his office at once.
Good. I can't possibly fight the fellow now.
Explain that to him, will you?
And tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.
Señores, your attention, please.
I'm buying wine for all.
Come on.
It's your last chance to fill up on me.
Last chance?
What do you mean?
My father has ordered me home.
I sail on the first ship from Lisbon.
To California?
But what about your commission here?
I'll have to give that up.
What's it like in California?
Are the Indians troublesome?
- Then who is there to fight?
- No one.
Then what will you do with this spur of yours, my cockerel?
This...
Leave it there.
And when you see it, think of me, in a land of gentle missions, happy peons, sleepy caballeros, and everlasting boredom.
Wine.
A toast.
To California, where a man can only marry, raise fat children, and watch his vineyards grow.
- Are the vineyards bearing well this season?
- By some miracle the grapes remain sweet.
- Why so gloomy, my friend?
- People can't sing with hatred in their hearts.
- Hatred for whom?
- The alcalde. May his soul burn in hell.
The alcalde?
A kinder, better man never lived.
You don't know him.
I should know him.
He's my father.
I said it, and I won't deny it. I've taken
20 lashes before for a slip of the tongue.
Row, row.
Get me to shore.
- I'm honoured. How can I serve you?
- A glass of your best wine.
- You are a stranger in these parts?
- No, not exactly.
I was born and raised not far from here.
I am the son of the alcalde.
Where can I get a carriage to drive me to Los Angeles?
Well, wake up.
Didn't you hear me?
This way.
Pedro, here is a caballero who would employ you. He is the son of the alcalde.
I want to be driven to Los Angeles.
I have some boxes and a portmanteau.
I'll pay you well.
Stop staring at me.
Will you drive me or not?
What's come over this country?
Have you all gone mad?
Listen, you.
Find speech, or I'll cut out your tongue.
Please. You are too late.
Your good father has already attended to that.
My father?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, but at a meeting of the peons, this man spoke against the heavy taxes.
The next day, the soldiers of His Excellency cut out his tongue. I swear it is true.
Therefore, until we receive the reinforcements promised us...
So people can still laugh in California.
I'd begun to think they'd lost the habit.
- Your name?
- He claims to be the son of the alcalde.
I claim nothing. I am Diego Vega, son of His Excellency, Don Alejandro.
And this, although I find it greatly changed, is my home.
Your pardon, Don Diego. I'd not heard of your returning. Welcome to California.
I'm Capitán Esteban Pasquale, military aid to the alcalde.
I'm honoured, but bewildered.
Why has my father turned his home into a barracks?
Conditions have changed since you left.
Your father resigned. Age, you know.
Since then, the peons have become more industrious.
As to the caballeros, they're encouraged to think of their own affairs.
We take care of the government.
I see.
- Tell me, who holds the office now?
- Don Luis Quintero. I'll take you to him.
Thank you, but I should like to see my family as quickly as possible.
- Where are they living?
- At your old hacienda.
But His Excellency'll never forgive me if I let you go without a word of welcome from him.
I'm quite sure that you'll save me a reprimand.
How could I refuse a man anything with a naked sword in his hand?
So a wit has come to Los Angeles.
Carry out your orders, Sergeant.
Foolish habit of mine.
Some men play with a glove, or a monocle, or a snuffbox.
Churchmen finger their beads.
I toy with a sword.
Do you fancy the weapon?
I know very little about it, my dear capitán.
Swordplay is such a violent business.
So, this is the bird that killed the black-breasted red?
Was it a bloody battle?
At the side of the pit, all the people were covered with blood.
Pity I missed it.
What are you asking for him?
This is a noble bird. Well tested.
I'm asking 40 pesos for him.
40 pesos? Esteban, this cheating dog should have his taxes raised.
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
The bird is yours, as a gift.
- Not one centimo will he cost you.
- That's a better attitude. Much better.
Turn him over to my handlers.
And what caballero is this?
Or is he some young lord from Spain?
A good guess, Excellency.
He's just from Spain.
This is Don Diego Vega, son of your respected predecessor.
I thought such fabric came from Madrid.
Must have cost you plenty, eh?
The caballero is here for words of welcome, not to discuss the price of his clothes.
Of course.
To be sure.
Welcome back, young sir.
Regard this house as still your home.
Luis, a ship has arrived from Spain.
The shops will have something worth looking at at last. I need...
Money.
It's always money.
I don't know this caballero.
- He's just off your precious ship from Spain.
- How delightful.
Will one of you ill-mannered boors present him?
Don Diego Vega.
Señora Inez de Quintero.
My wife.
Your Excellency is a very fortunate man.
I'm not so sure.
She thinks pesos grow on mulberry trees.
Your husband was also fascinated by the caballero's clothes.
Your pardon.
We're overwhelmed by the latest fashions.
And no wonder.
What is there here to interest a woman?
I long for the life you've been leading.
The gaiety and splendour of the court.
- Patience, my love. You'll see it all someday.
- Doubtless, when I'm an old hag.
That catastrophe could never overtake you.
Did you hear? How easily he makes pretty speeches.
I regret that...
You were saying?
I was saying that I must tear myself away and make some speeches to my father and mother.
Don't leave me to these barbarians.
Come to the shops with me and help me make my selections.
Oh, you tempt me.
I love the shimmer of satin and silk, the matching of one delicate shade against the other.
Then there's the choosing of scents and lotions - attar of rose, carnation, crushed lily, and musk.
- As for ornaments and jewels...
- But Don Diego must see his parents.
Too true.
Duty rather than pleasure.
I'll see you to the door.
That's one little peacock that won't give us any trouble.
You think not?
The capitán is jealous. The fop has pricked the fencing master. Touché.
I don't like such jests.
Your eye might fail you.
It's possible.
- Who was that?
- No one you know.
- Someone new. Very charming.
- He must be, from the colour in your cheeks.
At last, after all these months in this dreary place, someone who knows the newest fashions, the latest dances, how to flatter a woman.
- When can I meet him?
- Listen to the child.
You're much too young to cope with his sort.
Why do you allow her to wear that mantilla?
It makes her look like a woman grown.
I am a woman grown.
I'll be 18 my next birthday.
Carmen Castellano is a month younger and already wed.
Her grandmother was a peon.
Such riffraff wed when they like.
You have the blood of the hidalgos in your veins.
Keep it cool, my girl, or I'll whisk you into a convent.
I pity your poor mount, Sergeant.
Such a heavy whip.
Do you think I'd strike a good mare with this?
It would ruin her, break her spirit.
See? She didn't flick an ear.
She knows. We are collecting taxes from the peons today.
And you use that little switch on the taxpayers?
Only when they are stubborn.
When you come to collect my taxes,
I won't be stubborn, I promise you.
Turn right in here.
Mother.
- My son. My baby.
- Mother.
Hello, María.
Good old Juan, fat as ever.
Hello, Manuel. And José.
Where's Father?
In the study with Fray Felipe.
Come, he's longing to see you.
Take Don Diego's things to his room.
I tell you, these conditions are beyond bearing.
This whole district, from the hills of Verdugo to the shores of Del Rey, is a stench in the nostrils of heaven.
- I know.
- You know, yes.
- But what do you do about it? Nothing.
- What can...
Father.
My boy.
Padre.
Welcome back to your home and my heart.
- I've missed your wise counsel.
- Not too greatly, I suspect.
You remember Don Miguel and Don José?
- Have you returned to steal more melons?
- Melons?
This scamp and my scapegrace son crept into my garden and gorged themselves on my seed melons one year.
But God punished us. We were visited by the father of all bellyaches.
But he's ripe for more than boyish pranks now.
- I feel good muscle here.
- Arms, muscle... You men.
Is he without a face? Can't you see he's even better-looking than when he left?
You should have seen me when I approached the Spanish throne for the first time.
They said I looked like a frightened gopher.
More like a young angel, I'm sure.
An angel. That's what we need in California now. An angel with a flaming sword.
Please, don't start that.
He didn't come home to get himself killed.
Hold your tongue. Go to your women.
Leave my son to me. Sit down, Diego.
- What is all this, Father?
- Well, I am no longer alcalde.
- In my place is a man...
- In his place sits a viper so foul and black...
Ah, to be alone with him for five little minutes.
Long enough to tear his windpipe out of his throat.
God forgive me.
- Why did you resign in the first place?
- I was forced out of office.
They threatened to burn the homes of the peons.
- And now he sits here doing nothing, when...
- Enough, Felipe.
The friar urges me to lead the caballeros in a revolt which would surely fail against a garrison of trained soldiers.
Even if I thought it would succeed,
I'd refuse just the same.
- But why?
- Because the law is the law.
I will not rebel against the government
I served for 30 years.
But that government is now vile and corrupt.
I know, but two wrongs don't make a right, and never will.
- That is my feeling also.
- Sometimes, one must fight fire with fire.
I am a Vega. I will not follow the lawless footsteps of Luis Quintero.
- Nor will my son.
- No, of course not.
By the way, I went directly from the ship to our old home.
I met Señor Quintero and his charming wife.
I found them very pleasant and agreeable.
Pleasant scorpions.
Agreeable rattlesnakes.
Oh, Padre. The alcalde spoke with great respect of you, Father.
I must admit he hasn't troubled me or my flocks so far.
That being the case, why get overly excited in this heat?
I know I'm going to miss the scented breezes of Spain.
Then you believe we should not be moved by injustice and cruelty until it touches us?
But, my dear Padre, such things exist in the world and always will.
By the way, I took up sleight of hand while I was in Madrid.
It's all the rage just now.
Watch closely.
To think that the boy that I helped to raise, the boy that I taught to hold a firm wrist behind a true point, has turned into a puppy.
How vexatious. Well, I must go and remove the dust of travel.
I'll see you later, Father.
Stay where you are.
Put this up.
Put it up. Be quick about it.
Back to the barracks.
I don't understand why you insist on this stupid drive. And without an escort.
- I have my reasons.
- Suppose you share them with me.
Look... Gold. An agent of the Bank of Madrid is meeting us in a quiet inn.
This goes to Spain.
For us, my love.
I see.
How stupid of me.
- A military guard would...
- Let Esteban know about this transaction.
- Of course, he would have claimed his share.
- I'm afraid so.
Don't move if you want to live.
- A bandit.
- I have distressing news for you.
I had a small drinking bout with the agent of the Bank of Madrid.
While in his cups, the fellow was somewhat indiscreet.
A drunken man is untrustworthy.
I will act for him. Hand it over.
- And that little trinket.
- You would rob a woman?
- I can't afford gallantries.
- I refuse. You dare not take it.
Quickly. I should hate to mark such a lovely cheek.
This time I take only your money.
Next time...
What a nice, quiet study, Your Excellency.
I like a quiet room. Very quiet.
What do you want?
A little talk with you, that's all - if we come to an understanding.
Do you think the climate in Spain will agree with you?
Why do you ask?
Because you're either going there or to some place you might not like so well.
Which will it be?
- Spain.
- It's a very wise choice.
Now to the matter of your successor.
What do you think of Don Alejandro Vega?
He's had experience.
- What does it matter to me?
- Nothing.
But to the people of this district, a great deal.
When you resign, you'll appoint
Don Alejandro as your successor.
As you wish.
This will remind you that
I have been here once, and can return.
- Close your eyes.
- What are you going to do?
- What's that?
- The point of my sword against your throat.
Don't move until I take it away.
- What if I faint?
- You won't.
What's this?
Are you trying to commit suicide?
Speak up.
What's the matter?
- He was here.
- Who was here?
Ridiculous.
- Your fears have addled your brain.
- I tell you, he was here. In this very room.
- Anybody pass by this way?
- No one.
- Has anyone entered this room?
- His Excellency and yourself.
- Anyone else?
- No.
Do you need any more proof?
You must have fallen asleep and dreamed it.
Did I dream that?
Sergeant, turn out the guard. Zorro is somewhere on the grounds. Find him.
I still can't believe the fellow was here.
If you'd sat here with a sword at your throat, perhaps you'd believe it.
- How on earth did he get in?
- That's what I'd like to know.
- And it's your business to find out.
- What did he say?
He wants me in Spain and Vega in my place.
Now we have something.
This Zorro is a caballero.
A ordinary brigand wouldn't concern himself with Vega.
- It would serve you right if I did go to Spain.
- And give up 50,000 pesos a year?
I can't collect it if I'm dead.
And you get a third for protecting me.
But what protection! You can't keep even keep one mad dog off my neck.
Can't I?
I'll find him, I promise you.
In the meantime, I'll put a solid wall of men around this house night and day.
- I can't afford to lose you, my dear Luis.
- No, You can't.
Your pickings end if anything happens to me.
That's exactly what I meant, Excellency.
Blessed Mother, send someone to take me from this dreary place.
Someone I can love and respect.
Let him be kind and brave.
And handsome, please, dear Mother.
Fray Ramón, I didn't see you when I came in.
I'm not Fray Ramón.
I'm Fray Pablo, from the mission.
I've just been spending the evening with Fray Ramón.
Father, I was asking the Holy Mother to save me from a convent.
- Is that a sin?
- The sin would be in sending you to one.
- I don't understand.
- Well, a young girl with your...
I just think that you would probably be more useful outside a convent than in.
- You mean in serving God?
- Yes, in a way.
In what way?
Well, the Church must have sons and daughters, if she is to flourish.
- Do you follow me?
- I think so.
- You mean that I might marry and...
- Yes, exactly.
Strong sons and fine daughters to the glory of God.
I was praying just now for a husband.
You were? Fine.
I mean, it's quite natural at your age, my child.
Yes, but it's not natural for a girl of my age to long for a husband to rescue her.
- From what?
- Father...
Will you sit here and talk to me for a little while? I'm troubled, deeply.
I want to leave this lonely place.
I want to meet young people.
Girls of my own age.
No one ever comes here.
The caballeros avoid this place like the pest house.
- Why?
- They hate my Uncle Luis.
You know, I feel that there's something wrong about him.
Decidedly wrong.
What do you think?
If people hate him as you say, you have your answer there.
Then I was right. Perhaps I should be glad my Aunt Inez is sending me to a convent.
No, don't be glad about that.
I mean, probably your aunt feels that that atmosphere is better for a young girl,
- but I'm convinced...
- Inez? Oh, no.
No. That's not why she's sending me.
María says she's jealous.
She says it's because I'm good-looking.
- María has excellent eyesight.
- Thank you, Father, but are you sure?
No one except María ever says I'm pretty.
Pretty? Why, you are more radiant, more lovely than a morning in June.
You really think that?
- With all my heart.
- I've never heard such words before.
They make me almost lose my breath.
You should hear such words every hour of the day.
You're not in the least like Fray Ramón.
You talk so strangely.
You're not a padre. You're an impostor.
You're wearing a sword.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Zorro broke into the house and threatened your uncle.
They think he's still hiding somewhere close by.
Come along. Lock the doors after we leave, Fray Ramón.
The beast may try to rob the altar.
Good night, Padre.
Padre, you dropped something.
There he is.
There.
Three pesos.
Three pesos.
Four pesos.
- Nine pesos.
- I cannot pay so much.
I swear, it will leave me without a centavo.
- Nine pesos.
- But we will starve.
- How can I feed my family?
- Nine pesos.
Please, I beg of you.
My little girl...
That's all.
I'll relieve you of that, Sergeant.
I'll take that.
Get back.
After him.
Hear our prayer.
And drive far away from it... all the snares of the enemy.
And let thy holy angels dwell therein... to keep us at peace.
And may thy blessings... be upon us always.
Good evening, Padre.
It was so dull at home, and I remembered that you played a fair game of chess.
So I took the liberty of riding over and setting up the men.
What's the meaning of this?
How dare you?
We are after Zorro.
We saw him ride toward the mission.
Good evening, Sergeant.
- Zorro, you say? What's he done now?
- Enough to get himself hanged.
- Have you seen him?
- I have only this moment left the chapel.
- How long have you been here?
- Some little time. It seems like hours.
I've been waiting to play chess with the good padre.
- It's a dull game, but what can one do?
- You have seen or heard nothing?
Of Zorro? Heaven spare me.
My blood chills at the thought.
Out of here.
Search the grounds.
What's disturbing you, Padre?
Thoughts of that bandit?
- Puppy.
- Oh, my dear Padre, really.
When I think of what one man, single-handed, has accomplished against these devils, and see you, the last of the Vegas, trembling at the very mention of his name, I could...
Can't you even listen to me?
Ordinarily, I'd drink in every word you say, but just now...
Thank you, Mother.
- Quick. Hide this plunder.
- Plunder?
Don't stand there gaping at me like a fish. Put it away.
- What is this?
- It's some of the alcalde's gold.
And this I took from his charming wife.
It's pretty, don't you think?
You took it?
Have you seen this one, Padre?
So my old mentor has no more wit than the rest of them, eh?
Are you trying to make me the receiver of stolen goods?
No, the dispenser.
This gold was wrung from the peons.
It's up to us to restore it to them.
My boy.
My boy.
My Diego.
Then you will lead your people against these scorpions?
No, we'd be no match for their trained troops. My father was right about that.
You must have had the alcalde at your mercy when you took the gold from him.
I would have snuffed him out like a candle.
God forgive me.
It would accomplish nothing.
Anotherjust like him would take his place.
I see.
I see everything.
Diego, don't deceive your father any longer.
- It's not fair to him.
- I don't like doing it. Believe me.
But I must.
My father is such a stickler for law and order, that I'm afraid he might spoil all the fun.
But what do you hope to achieve all alone, taking his money?
Oh, no.
But I may be able to persuade him to resign and name my father in his place.
- Amusing, don't you think?
- If you live.
Doña Inez begs you to make yourself comfortable. She'll be down shortly.
What's this?
- Don Diego Vega.
- Oh, yes. What can I do for you?
Have you forgotten that you urged me to regard this house as still my home?
Did I?
It's very good of you to remember the offer, but didn't you have trouble getting in?
Oh, no. I had a note from Doña Inez asking me to ride with her this morning, and I just showed it to the sentries.
Excellent.
Come into my study till my wife appears.
It's been Esteban's privilege to ride with her each morning.
Why is this house so closely guarded?
I swear I saw a full company around it.
- I wish there were twice as many.
- Their clatter would drive me to distraction.
I find it reassuring.
Let me show you something, young man.
Look.
The mark of Zorro.
He came here one night.
He threatened my life and left that.
I should be petrified.
He's mad, of course.
Quite mad.
- You think so?
- Of course.
There was a case in Madrid, almost identical.
This fellow's mark was a cross.
He was a madman.
Cunning beyond belief.
They always are.
He killed 40 people.
Slit their throats from ear to ear.
Warned them first, you know, and then...
It's a pity your sense of duty keeps you here.
- Frightful risk.
- Sense of duty?
Yes, of course.
I'm so sorry to have kept you.
Esteban was surly about our little ride.
- I'd promised the morning to him, it seems.
- Your invitation was a smile from heaven.
- I was positively suffocating with boredom.
- Then let's fly. I'm dying for a canter.
Goodbye, Luis.
Don't work too hard.
Goodbye, Excellency.
Esteban, Vegajust told me a horrible tale about a madman in Madrid, like this Zorro.
- He thinks I risk my life by staying here.
- Forget your fears. I have a plan.
Yes?
What is it?
Don Alejandro is the leader of the caballeros.
Zorro wants you to appoint him in your place.
- What do you gather from that?
- Go on.
Doesn't it suggest to you that Zorro is the tool of Don Alejandro?
- Perhaps, but how can we prove it?
- We can at least help the situation.
- How?
- Form an alliance with Don Alejandro.
That's impossible.
You know Vega's attitude.
Perfectly, but Lolita should have a husband.
What could be stronger than a matrimonial alliance?
Royal families keep the peace of Europe in bridal beds.
Diego and Lolita.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Diego, talking with you is like a drink of cool water in the desert.
- Oh, it's a pity.
- What?
- I mustn't make you discontented.
- Oh, please. Of what were you thinking?
I was just thinking how you're being wasted here.
Your beauty, your gift for words, your perfect poise.
You were born for something higher and more civilised than this provincial life.
I know.
- May I tell you something?
- Anything.
Yes, of course I may.
I felt from the moment we met that we...
Esteban is urging me to leave my husband and go to Spain with him.
- Oh, but my dear, no.
- But I'm dying here.
Go to Spain, but not with Esteban.
With whom, then?
- With your husband.
- My husband?
- Go to romantic, beautiful Spain with Luis?
- Let me explain.
As the wife of the one-time alcalde of Los Angeles, you'd be received at court.
But as the companion of a second-rate soldier of fortune, you'd be ostracised.
I see.
But Luis at court, imagine.
In Spain the husbands of adorable ladies are merely background.
- I'd be lost among so many.
- Not you.
You'd need only one "friend" to introduce you into the proper circles.
But I have no such friend in Madrid.
Who knows? I don't intend to remain in California for ever.
- What you suggest is utterly impossible.
- I'll give a dowry of 20,000 pesos. 25,000.
Are you buying my son, Señor Quintero?
- There's the practical side to consider.
- It doesn't enter into this.
You come here on a friendly mission with half a company of troops. Why?
Not to threaten you, Don Alejandro.
It's because of this Zorro.
Zorro is only a symptom. This district is bleeding under your vile administration.
I would never appear to condone it by marriage between our families.
In that case, the friendly attitude
I've taken towards you, will cease.
What is all this turmoil about?
His Excellency has offered a marriage between his niece Lolita and you.
His niece?
How flattering.
But why should that cause an argument on a hot day like this?
- Do I have to explain?
- Your father resents my efforts to make the people of the district more industrious than under his regime.
Grinding them into poverty and despair to line your own pockets is hardly...
Oh, politics, politics.
What have they to do with my marriage?
- You'd marry into the family of this...?
- How can I tell until I've seen her?
- She may look like her uncle.
- Quite right. I...
Oh, no. She's a sweet little dove. It would desolate us to have her leave the nest.
If she were Venus, she'd still be his niece.
But, after all,
I'm not marrying His Excellency.
Don't you think the wishes of your father in this sort of matter should be considered?
I had no say in my father's marriage.
Why should he try to instruct me in mine?
Exactly.
Will you dine with us tonight?
- Charmed.
- We'll expect you at eight o'clock.
Diego, what have you done?
It will be all right.
No matter what you think now, please don't worry.
This was your doing, you sly beast.
You gave Luis the idea of this marriage.
Alliances for the good of the state have been fashionable since the dawn of history.
- María, my knees are shaking.
- Yes, that is natural.
- Shall I bow, or give him my hand to kiss?
- Both. First the hand, then the bow.
It's 20 minutes past the hour.
What can be keeping him?
Well, well, well.
Here you are at last.
I was afraid that you might have been waylaid by that Zorro fellow.
Oh, heaven spare me.
- I am dazzled.
- And here is our little dove, Lolita.
- I am honoured.
- Charmed, I'm sure.
May I present Señora María de López?
You'll forgive me for being late.
They heated the water for my bath too early.
It was positively tepid. By the time more was carried and properly scented...
Life can be trying, don't you think?
- Oh, please.
- Courage.
Well, shall we dine?
Come, Diego.
His bath was tepid.
Poor Lolita. I'm afraid her wedded life will be the same.
- Please do that again.
- As you wish. Observe closely.
- Amazing.
- Quite simple.
- Have you seen this one?
- No.
Now, observe very closely.
- Frightfully amusing.
- Yes, I did this one for His Majesty.
- It must be heavenly at court.
- It's the one bearable spot on earth.
Speaking of that Zorro, Excellency, could you provide me with an escort home?
On the way here, I fancied that cutthroat lurking in every shadow. I was unnerved.
How distressing.
- You don't approve of my request.
- You called her hero a cutthroat.
Have you met the fellow?
I've never so much as seen his face.
I happen to admire courage.
Dashing about with a cutlass has been out of fashion since the Middle Ages.
It seems to be quite effective. He is like a lion among a lot of frightened sheep.
A madman, that's what he is.
Undoubtedly.
Capitán, you seem to regard that poor fruit as an enemy.
A rival.
My dear Esteban is for ever thrusting at this and that.
He used to be a fencing instructor in Barcelona.
How exhausting.
- I didn't find it so.
- Then why did you give it up?
- Unfortunately, I killed a man of influence.
- A lady was involved, I believe.
The gentleman's wife, no doubt?
Just how did you mean that?
I'd hoped to be amusing.
Have I failed?
Somewhat.
With me.
What are the new dance steps?
You know them all, I suppose.
- I'm afraid so.
- I would so love to have you show me.
Gladly.
- Inez would enjoy it more.
- Nonsense, my child. Dance with him.
Play "El Sombrero Blanco".
I never dreamed dancing could be so wonderful.
I found it rather fatiguing.
- If you'll excuse me, I wish to retire.
- So sorry.
- What's got into the girl?
- Who knows?
- Our little dove has flown.
- I don't like it.
You can't be serious about this marriage.
But, my dear, it's perfect.
You and I could be seen together anywhere in Madrid without any danger of gossip.
- Excellency, your niece is charming.
- A sweet child.
May I plead with you for her hand in marriage?
A refusal would crush me.
She's yours, my dear Diego, with all my blessings.
Who's there?
- I have a confession to make.
- Please go. You'll be caught.
I must talk to you.
Now, look here, my girl.
What do you mean by running away from the man to whom I've promised you in marriage?
- You've done that without asking me?
- Of course.
What do you know about such things?
And it's time that you understood that...
- Who's that?
- No one.
Forgive me, my dear.
I've been an old fool.
You seem to know how to handle these matters much better than your Uncle Luis.
You?
Don't come in here.
I have something important to say to you and I don't want to be interrupted.
You, pretending to be Zorro.
I don't care to hear anything you have to say.
So unlock that door and go.
I'm glad to see you took the advice
I gave you in the chapel.
About not hiding such beauty in a convent.
What did you say?
You're more lovely, more radiant than a morning in June.
Surely I must be dreaming.
- You are Zorro.
- Yes, Lolita.
In order to accomplish what I set out to do,
I've had to deceive people, including you.
Yes, I see.
I understand.
You don't have to explain.
You came here to tell me that asking to marry me was just part of the game.
Oh, no. That's the one real thing about this whole masquerade.
- Go quickly.
- Ride with me tomorrow.
Yes, but go.
Be careful.
- Open the door.
- Yes, I'm coming.
You seem upset, my dear.
Have you been crying?
- Yes, I have.
- I understand.
This marriage was your uncle's idea.
He's not your type, and far too sophisticated.
- You really think so?
- Beyond a question.
I saw how he affected you tonight.
My heart bled for you, my dear.
When you tell Luis you'll have none of this marriage, you'll have my full support.
I hardly know what to say.
Uncle Luis has done so much for me.
Nonsense. He has no right to expect you to spoil your life.
Any marriage is better than none, I suppose.
Perhaps I could learn to tolerate Diego.
I do so want to please Uncle Luis.
There's such a thing as carrying gratitude too far.
We can't ask you to spend your life with a man you think repulsive.
We'll talk of this again in the morning.
Good night, my dear.
Past midnight.
He's not home yet.
- How can you read?
- It's the latest European styles.
- Bustles are coming in, it seems.
- Bustles! What is a bustle?
It's something to build you up here.
Our only son in the clutches of those polecats, and you sit there planning to decorate your...
There you are. Why didn't you spend the entire night with your delightful friends?
What have you done about that girl?
Well, how did you get out of it?
She's perfectly charming.
A lovely, unspoiled child.
- You'll be delighted with her, Father.
- I will be delighted? What have you done?
I've just taken the first steps toward making you a grandfather.
What?
What a son you bore me.
An alliance with those terrible people.
Why did you do it?
- For the best reason in the world.
- What is that?
- Lolita Quintero.
- She attracts you?
- It's more than that. From the day I first saw...
- I thought you hadn't met her until tonight.
I did catch a glimpse of her some time ago, and...
You're concealing something from us.
I'm sure of it.
- It's time you went to bed.
- Very well.
But, Diego, tell me as soon as you can.
I will, Mother.
- What's the meaning of that?
- Gonzales was collecting taxes.
A priest resisted.
The fool gave him ten lashes.
- Send Gonzales to me.
- I wish I could.
- What's to prevent it?
- The total disappearance of Gonzales.
- He's gone? Where?
- To Hades, I hope.
I'll collect the taxes myself from now on.
That should teach them.
What's that?
You...
- What's that?
- Sergeant Gonzales. I think he's dead.
Dead, you say?
- He's alive.
- He's got a Z on his chest.
José.
How is the little one?
She is well again.
I brought this to give thanks to the church.
Give thanks in your heart.
Buy milk for the child with this.
No. This is for the church.
I come at precisely the right moment, it seems.
- I'll take that.
- These are the funds of the mission.
Not any longer.
Hand them over.
- I refuse.
- In that case, I shall take them.
You should have been a soldier rather than a churchman.
No wonder you chose the Church.
- Where did you get this?
- I'll tell you nothing.
Run me through and have done with it.
No, my dear Padre.
We shall presently hang you.
For the last time. If you marry that girl, you leave this house for ever.
It might be rather amusing to live with the Quinteros.
If I'd only left him in Spain.
Wait till you see her.
She's just like this blossom.
I'll never see her.
I promise you that.
- We are not at home.
- I'm at home to the señorita. Show her in.
- So you defy me, too?
- You're not being sensible.
- Father, this is Lolita.
- I am honoured.
And my mother.
Please forgive me, but would it be possible to see you alone for a moment?
Señorita, will you answer me one question?
- Certainly.
- Do you want to marry my son?
- Why, yes.
- Why?
Well, I love him.
You are right, my son.
She is like the flower.
Something terrible has happened.
They've arrested Fray Felipe.
They say he is Zorro and they are going to hang him.
- Where is he now?
- At the barracks. What can you do?
I don't know yet.
So far I've only frightened your uncle.
This may mean I'll have to do more than that.
Do you understand?
If that becomes necessary, will it make any difference between us?
Sentries!
There's someone in that chair. Seize him.
Diego, what are you doing here?
You frightened me half out of my wits.
This is too much, really.
It's distressing enough to call on my betrothed and not find her at home.
- Now to be manhandled by these ruffians.
- Leave us.
Where is Lolita?
Oh, riding, driving, walking.
What does a young girl do?
Am I to understand that my betrothed is allowed to wander about the countryside without a duenna?
I protest, Your Excellency.
I protest strongly.
I can't discuss that now.
Do you know Zorro had a priest for an accomplice?
We arrested him today.
And another horrible thing happened to me.
Sergeant Gonzales was beaten half to death by Zorro.
He shoved him over the wall right before my eyes.
How frightful.
But after all, it was harder on Gonzales.
This is no time forjesting.
Perhaps, that madman is lurking on the grounds right now.
What shall I do?
I offer rewards and nothing happens.
He may change his mind about you.
Those creatures usually do, I believe.
He may decide to cut the throat of someone else.
- Must you always talk of throat-cutting?
- How thoughtless of me.
- What you need is a drop of brandy.
- Yes, brandy...
It's gone. I'm surrounded by idiots.
Stupid servants, stupid soldiers.
I admire you tremendously.
Your courage, your fortitude.
Why, a weaker man would forget his civic duty and get away from all this.
- You rang, Your Excellency?
- Yes, brandy.
- On the desk, Your Excellency.
- It's not on the desk. Bring some.
A situation of this sort would wreck my constitution in a week.
But then I haven't the iron nerve of Your Excellency.
Your Excellency, come quickly.
Something has happened in the cellar.
Guards.
You, follow me.
Look.
Look, Your Excellency.
Here in the cellar, right below my study.
Here's his trail.
It goes this way.
It ends here.
He couldn't have gone through the wall.
He's not human. He's...
Light my way out of here. Quick!
You were right.
I'll leave this cursed place.
I'll do as he asks.
Pen, paper...
A man should consider his wife.
Inez has gone crazy over the idea of Madrid.
She's been at me night and day to take her there.
This should do it.
This should suit that maniac.
There, look it over.
That's very direct.
But you forgot to sign.
- Sign what?
- My resignation.
Zorro will kill me if I stay.
You may escape him, but I will surely kill you if you write any more of these.
But I'm in grave danger.
Diego here will bear me out.
You're in even greater danger than he thinks.
So you tried to get gold out of the country?
If you ever again take one peso of mine,
I'll cut your throat from ear to ear.
I must ask you to change the subject.
He objects to talk of throat-cutting.
Quiet, you popinjay.
I've no reason for letting you live either.
What a pleasant coincidence.
I feel exactly the same way about you.
You wouldn't care to translate that feeling into action, would you?
I might be tempted, if I had a weapon.
Would you?
Now, please, gentlemen.
- This is going much too far.
- It's only to serve you, Excellency.
You have a champion, Luis.
And what a champion.
I'll make it short, and save you fatigue.
- Sentries!
- No interference, Excellency, please.
We have a hero with us.
- Are you all right, Diego?
- Ask the capitán.
Get out.
The fencing master has met his equal.
Careful.
- Are you tiring, Diego?
- No, Excellency, I'll take you on in a moment.
- It's a good effort, capitán.
- My next will be better, my fancy clown.
- The capitán's blade is not so firm.
- Still firm enough to run you through.
I needed that scratch to awaken me.
He's dead.
Well, he's been troublesome lately.
And you killed him.
A secret stairway from the cellar.
We just discovered it.
A secret stairway?
Leading here?
Good. Very good.
Excellent.
You shall be rewarded.
Sentries!
Keep that man covered.
Take him to the guardhouse and lock him in the cell.
- The strongest cell you have.
- Why arrest me, Excellency?
For three reasons. First, you have mud from the cellar on your boots.
Second, that secret stairway happens to be in your old home.
And third, you handle a sword like a devil from hell.
And that's exactly where you're going, Señor Zorro.
That's a pretty way to treat your future nephew, Uncle Luis.
No more of your wit.
Take him away.
You, Morales...
Send the officer of the day to me. I want all caballeros and peons summoned here.
All caballeros are requested to report at the alcalde's residence immediately.
- At this hour? Ridiculous.
- The alcalde's orders.
Sergeant, assemble your men for firing-squad duty.
- But why did they arrest Diego?
- I don't know.
Luis won't tell me.
He must have lost his mind.
Come in.
His Excellency requests you ladies to stay in your rooms tonight.
- Why?
- I cannot say. I was ordered to tell you.
Firing squad, forward.
- Good evening.
- Why are we meeting here, Señor Vega?
What do you know, Alejandro?
Nothing. I was forced to come here like the rest of you.
They must be up to something.
Good evening, señores.
It's a pleasure to see you here.
Get to the point. Why have you dragged us out of our homes at this hour?
To witness a delightful spectacle.
You will find it particularly interesting.
I'm executing a caballero at midnight.
- What caballero?
- Who is it?
The man you selected from among you to defy me, to threaten my life.
I brought you here to see him die as a lesson to the lot of you.
I, for one, don't know what you're talking about.
You almost convince me.
Too bad you're about to lose the best actor among you.
But in a few moments, you'll see your precious Zorro shot.
Observe very closely.
Watch the candle.
Blow.
You should really see something worthwhile, like changing a copper coin into solid gold.
- Can you do that?
- The good padre here has seen me do it.
- Many times.
- It was a secret discovered by Merlin.
It's been handed down through a long line of sorcerers to some of us living today.
You can change a centavo into gold?
- Easily.
- Please, do that for me.
I am very weary.
I must seek repose.
I have a wife and seven children, and the little I earn isn't enough for them.
Please, make gold for them and I'll pray for you.
If I must, I must.
Now, hold the centavo in your closed fist.
Tightly now.
Put your fist well through the bars.
Cold iron will spoil everything.
I take your fist gently, like this.
Open the door.
Be quick about it.
Get in. Get down under there, close to the wall.
And not a sound.
Close the door.
Hide this in your robe.
Sit down.
And now, you will behold the result of your rebellious plans. Come in.
Here is Zorro the fox, safely trapped.
Diego!
What is this?
What idiotic joke is this?
- As if you didn't know.
- Luis Quintero, you are a fool.
Zorro is a man. This is my worthless, trick-playing offspring.
Have you seen this one, Father?
Help!
Zorro is loose.
- Señores, are you with me?
- I am with you.
God, forgive me.
God, forgive me.
What a splendid audience you have.
Peons, caballeros, everyone.
- It was thoughtful of you to have them here.
- Luis, what's happened?
Good evening, ladies. You're just in time.
His Excellency is about to make an address.
Address? What shall I say?
You know.
The little matter of your resignation.
Quiet!
Quiet for His Excellency.
We're waiting. Go on.
Good people of Los Angeles, owing to my ceaseless efforts to improve conditions in the district... my health is endangered.
I have therefore decided to give up my office and go to Spain.
To succeed me as alcalde of this district,
I am naming my illustrious predecessor,
Don Alejandro Vega.
And now, Your Excellency, I personally will accompany you to the wharf at San Pedro.
I wish to bless your voyage, and ask God to reward you according to your merits.
Spain...
Spain!
Diego, when may we expect you and our dear little Lolita in Madrid?
- We'll follow the customs of California.
- What do you mean?
We are going to marry, and raise fat children and watch our vineyards grow.

The princess -
Have you got news for me?
No, Master.
- Dead?
- She still sleeps.
- You followed my orders?
- Yes, Master.
- And the blind man?
- He has been found.
Hmm.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
What? Your cur would bark?
Afine reward for charity.
If charity be false as that coin.
Then you cheat, son of a burnt father.
A blind man cannot tell truth from false.
Alas, I cannot tell day from night.
It was my dog.
- How can a dog tell bad from good?
- See for yourself.
Now, by the wonder of Allah -
It is a false coin, and I, myself, knew it not!
Come, O frequenter of tree trunks... now which is the bad one?
This is no dog, but the reincarnation of a tax collector!
O ye whom Allah gave
the gift of sight... to fill your eyes with beauty and delight... spare me a thought to whom your wondrous world... is but a city of eternal night.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
- Bring him to me.
- Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Pray for me.
My name is Halima.
- I do not know you?
- Does one always know one's friends?
I have none to know.
Can you not trust in one
who brings not words, but deeds♪
In my house, there is food and rest.
And what is mine is yours.
- Why should you offer this?
- For your prayers.
That is much for little.
- Take my hand.
- There's no need. My dog sees for me.
He gives me more than ever he can receive, like all dogs.
This is a sleep beyond my knowledge.
Only this I know: When the blind man comes to her, she will be cured.
Strange, Master, he can do something all your powers cannot.
I'll make him do it for me and cast him away.
But she loves the blind man.
Do you call the lisping of two children in a garden love?
Love she has yet to learn.
And I am here to teach her.
- Poor blind beggar.
- Even more unfortunate than you know.
- That cannot be.
- But we are unveiled.
And I am... veiled.
- Tell us your name.
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad!
- Ahmad, you'll beg no more.
- Nor journey on.
- Stay here with us.
O sovereigns of silkiness,
I am sure you are beautiful... but for me there is no staying.
I must on, seeking the one I love, whom I have lost.
Men with two eyes often seek all their lives and fail to find that one.
Stay. There are great doctors here.
They may restore your sight.
That would be the blackest day of all my days.
- You talk in riddles.
- I will give you the answer. Listen.
There was once a king, son of a king and of a hundred kings.
His subjects countless, his wealth untellable... his power absolute.
And this dog was not a dog... but a youth who lived in Bagdad and became dear to the king.
But in those days,
he was nothing but a little thief.
Why do you smell my fish, master of a copper coin? Be off! Be off!
Shall I call the khadi's clubmen? Eh?
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief! Stop that thief!
Ahmad the king.
Son of Akbar, grandson of Haroun-el-Rachid... the great, the illustrious... lord of the earth, defender of the faith... servant of the all-highest... but master of all men.
Ahmad the king!
Ahmad the king.
Alas, I was that mighty man.
365 wives were mine.
In my heart there was no love.
Fifty palaces, and I had no home.
Richest among my subjects,
I was the poorest of the poor.
Every desire satisfied,
I grew empty of desire.
And in my whole vast kingdom,
I could find nothing to do - no task, no aim, no purpose - for always my grand vizierJaffar stood between me and my people.
Another execution.
Why had he to die?
He had been thinking, my lord and master.
- Is it a crime then to think?
- In a subject, it's quite unpardonable.
Are men only to be ruled by fear?
Men are evil - hatred behind their eyes, lies on their lips, betrayal in their hearts.
You will learn one day, great king... that there are about three things that men respect: the lash that descends, the yoke that breaks and the sword that slays.
By the power and terror of these, you may conquer the earth.
Do I want to conquer the earth?
What do you want, my lord and master?
I thought I might try to give them happiness.
Happiness. They are fools and knaves.
Your grandsire knew it, and if you would know it too... do as he did.
One night, when darkness falls... leave your palace, go among your people... mix with the crowds, go into their houses... listen, observe and remember.
- Tonight, Jaffar.
- Tonight, my king.
- Your people, my king.
- I've never been so close to them.
Go. Listen, observe and remember.
It is told, though Allah be wiser or more merciful...
there was in the past of the ages
a king among kings...
a master of arms and of armies,
of vessels and auxiliaries.
And this master of time and people
was an oppressor to both...
and the earth was as pitch in the faces
ofhis subjects and his slaves.
- What's he saying?
- And they groaned together in secret.
Why, I don't know.
Is it the king he's talking about?
Don't ask questions.
There are spies everywhere.
You must be careful in Bagdad.
I'm a stranger here. Surely you can tell me what the old man's talking about.
Oh, about foolish hopes... about a prophecy, about a liberator.
Only fools and children believe it.
A liberator indeed.
Not while Ahmad is king.
And they groaned together in secret and were slain in the marketplace.
But a wise man among the sages of Bagdad
comforted them with a prophecy...
saying, "In the fullness of years,
a liberator shall come upon you...
"and this shall be the sign ofhim:
he shall be the lowest of the low...
and you shall look for him
in the clouds."
And the people cried,
"We shall look for him in the clouds indeed...
"for if the great are powerless
to save us from this tyrant...
how can one of no account avail?"
And the reader
of the Milky Way replied...
"Have faith, trust in Allah...
"for there, one day in the blue,
you shall see a boy...
"the lowest of the low, mounted upon a cloud.
"But the cloud shall be as strong as the hills beneath the snow...
"and from the ranges of the sky...
he shall destroy this tyrant
with the arrow ofjustice."
- What is the name of the tyrant?
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad.
I wish the miracle would happen today.
I wish he would die today.
Arrest him. Put him in prison.
When he says he's the king, tell them he's a madman.
His friends and all who might be loyal to him must be destroyed.
I learned that night not that men are evil, but that he was evil.
When he persuaded me among my people,
he laid a trap for me.
I was thrown into prison...
and there, in prison,
my life began... for there I met the one who was to become my only true friend -
Abu, the little thief of Bagdad.
For only very little thieves are thrown into prison.
No! No! Not in prison!
No! No! Not in prison!
- Don't put me in prison! No!
- Come in, thief.
Cut off his right arm, and then his left.
Then his left leg, then his right.
- And then his head.
- No! No! No! No!
I say no! No! Please, no!
Don't kill me!
- I don't want to die!
- Tomorrow morning.
And as for the madman, our great sultan Jaffar is merciful.
Only his head.
As the sun rises.
No! No, no!
- No! No, no!
Poor boy, they've driven you mad.
Me mad?
Theyjust said you were mad.
Are you really mad?
That's it. I'm mad. I must be mad.
The maddest of all the madmen that ever lived in the sultan's palace.
- You are mad, quite mad.
- What's it matter♪
In the morning, unless the sun stops still and never rises, we both die -
the thief and the madman-
and I don't want to die.
You are not mad... and maybe we shall watch the sun rise from over the river.
Didn't you hear the jailer?
"As the sun rises."
As the sun rises, we'll take a boat and go down to the sea.
I've never seen the sea... but I've heard the sailors on the riverside talk about it.
In the sea are fishes as big as the great temple... and little ones as tiny as my little finger, with wings.
And boats as big as Bagdad itself... with sails as big as clouds.
And when the wind blows, they go as fast as antelopes... and carry you to the isles of India and China.
To the isles of India and China.
And we're locked in prison.
The ax will fall as the sun rises.
And you say you're not mad.
- Look!
- What's that?
The key of the prison.
I just stole it.
- The key? Give it to me!
- Steady, steady.
You want someone to look after you.
We can't go now.
- Why not?
- We must wait. In an hour they will eat.
After they eat, they sleep.
Then we go.
Hurry! Catch this oar.
Give me that rope!
Hurry! We must get away.
Do you want us to be killed?
Do you think they will have mercy on us?
Don't you think if the king knew, he'd be merciful?
The king was a fool. I hope he suffers as much as he made the people suffer.
- Do you hate him so much?
- Everybody hated him.
Oh, if I could only lay my hands on him just once... if I could only tell him what a fool he was.
Tell it now.
I am Ahmad the king.
- Speak.
- Ahmad the king is dead.
He died yesterday.
There's a new king, Jaffar.
- Look!
Jaffar would not make all that fuss over me.
He would not send the whole guard after me.
Mercy, Master. I'm your slave.
Leave me at least one arm for small stealing, and I'll pay you twice as much in taxes.
- What's your name?
- I'm Abu the thief... son of Abu the thief, grandson of Abu the thief.
Most unfortunate of 10 sons
with a hunger that yawns day and night.
Get up, my little friend.
- We must return to Bagdad.
- How can you be such a fool?
I mean, my king would be killed.
A dead king and a dead thief cannot do much, you know.
If your fingers are as nimble as your brain, you are indeed the prince of thieves.
Come on. Let's catch the morning breeze.
That will carry us to freedom.
Freedom. Strange.
I've had everything but freedom.
And I've had nothing but freedom.
And now we've got it, what shall we do with it?
Anything we like.
In three days, we shall be in Basra.
Here. Take this pole. Push!

Abu! Basra!
Basra.
Basra. How beautiful it looks.
How beautiful it smells!
Pancakes!
- Give me one!
- Really, you are a fool.
Whoever heard of eating pancakes without honey?
But how can you steal honey?
Allah give us the pancakes, and he will provide honey.
- Honey! Honey!
- Ah.
Honey! Honey!
- You buy honey?
- Yes, we are thinking of buying some.
- Uh, a jar, of course.
- Jar?
- Uh, if it's good honey.
- The best in Basra.
Uh, easy to say. First I must try.
Ahh. I've tasted better.
What do you think?
- No. No, not good enough.
- No.
- Your bees are out ofhumor.
- Take better care of them.
Hey, old friend.
Whose palace is this?
Why, the palace of the sultan, children of ignorance.
- The palace of a thousand toys.
- Toys?
Where have you come from, you beggars of no importance?
Don't you know that the sultan has the greatest collection of toys in the world?
Why toys?
The sultan is an old man, and old men are like children.
He guards his toys more jealously... than he guards his daughter.
But I say no more. Now out of my way, you masters of a thousand fleas.
Allah be with you, but I doubt it.
- What's happening?
- Let me go!
- Not until you've told us.
- The princess comes!
- Then why does everybody go?
- It's death to look on her.
- Death?
- Why?
No man has ever seen her, nor shall, till her father gives her in marriage.
- Is she so ugly?
- Her beauty is like the sun and the moon.
Let me go!
- Let us go!
- Where?
Up there!
Ah.
- Your eating will cause our death.
- Without eating, we die.
Abu! Here they come!
- I must see her again.
- But I've found Sinbad the sailor.
And he has given us two places on his ship.
It is more wonderful than I'd ever imagined.
And on the next tide, she sails.
I can't go.
I must see her again.
But, Ahmad, all my life I dreamt of going in a great ship across the world.
I can't go.
I must see her again.
If I help you to see her, will you then come with me?
I will.
♪ O throbbing heart of mine♪
♪ Be still today♪
? We must await the word?
? That all men say?
♪ And when, O heart of mine♪
♪t comes to you♪
? Leap up?
? Remembering?
? It might?
? Be true?
♪t might be true?♪
No more. The music of a love song is as heavy as the noonday air.
Let us wait for the nightingale and the night.
To the pool.
Oh!
A djinni!
A djinni!
A djinni. Don't go! Don't go.
It's a djinni in the pool.
A djinni.
Are you afraid?
Yes. Terribly.
Why don't you run away♪
I want to look.
I've never seen a djinni before.
Well, then what do you see?
Remember always, to a djinni,
you must tell the truth.
You don't look wicked.
Are you a good djinni?
Not too good. Very good djinni are just as tiresome as very good men.
- Do you live down there?
- No.
- Why have you come?
- To see you.
- I was about to bathe.
- I'm waiting.
Bathe, with you there?
Give me your hand then.
Down into the water.
Oh, djinni, you've gone.
I didn't mean you to go so soon.
Shall I never see you again?
Never?
Don't be afraid.
I'm not a djinni.
Who are you?
Your slave.
Where have you come from?
From the other side of time... to find you.
How long have you been searching?
Since time began.
Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Till the end of time.
For me, there can be no more beauty in the world but yours.
For me, there can be no more pleasure in the world... than to please you.
Will you be here in the garden tomorrow at the same hour?
There's a gardener here who watches night and day.
His name is Death.
You mustn't come.
Forbid me then.
I cannot forbid.
Tomorrow!
And all tomorrows.
- Did you see her?
- I did.
Good! Then we can go with Sinbad tonight.
- No, Abu. I can't go.
- Why not? You have seen her again.
That's why I can't go - because I have seen her.
All right.
Then I'll go alone.
If you go there tomorrow again... how will you pass the guards without me to help?
- Oh, I'll find a way.
- You'll be caught.
You'll stay with me?
Oh, Abu, why should you?
You have as great a longing in your soul as I have.
- Why should you stay with me?
- Because I'm as great a fool as you are.
Brother of lions.
Fountain of hospitality.
You know, I have the largest collection of these mechanical devices... in the whole wide world.
And this is the most remarkable of them all.
I-It tells the time.
See how it works? Huh?
Sheer magic, isn't it?
I hope this dangerous device will never be allowed into the hands of the people.
- Dangerous?
- Yes.
If people once begin to know the time... they will no longer call you the king of time.
They will want to know how time is spent.
Oh, you're right.
Oh, the people must never know.
Look, look. Come.
Ah! See.
Such workmanship.
Such - Such precision.
Such reliability.
I do so prefer these things to my subjects.
Watch. Watch.
See. No, no.
That's the finest of them all.
See?
- I have only to wind a key or press a spring - and they do exactly the same thing every time... and exactly what I want.
And so often my subjects fail to do exactly what I want... and then I have to have their heads cut off.
See? Oh!
Your collection is indeed magnificent... and so near completion too.
Near completion? Huh.
I'd have you know my collection is-is the most complete completion.
Please, do not misunderstand me.
I am well aware that nothing short of a miracle could add luster... to this already dazzling display.
But such a miracle does exist.
A mechanical toy better than - than any of mine?
Knowing of your interest in these matters,
I have brought it with me.
Well, let's see it. Let's see it.
Quickly, quickly!
Oh, I can't bear to be kept waiting.
Ooh. This is exciting, this.
If Your Highness would wind it yourself.
Uh -
Oh! What's it going to do? Hmm?
Move its legs, or arch its neck?
Or- Or wag its tail? Hmm?
It doesn't kick, does it?
To tell you the truth, I'm always rather nervous of these things...
Till I know what they're going to do,
Till I get used to them.
Ooh. Ah.
It wants some winding.
- If Your Highness would mount.
- Yes.
- And now?
- Pull the reins!
Marvelous!
I am no longer a man. I am a bird!
I'm the king of birds!
Oh.
No! Oh. Mmm, I want it!
I want it. I must have it, and I'll give you anything you wish for it.
It's yours.
I ask but one thing in return.
Anything you will.
- Your daughter.
- My daughter♪
Mm-hmm.
Oh, dear, dear, dear. Really.
This is -This is very awkward.
Wh -What do you want my daughter for?
- I have to found a dynasty.
- Oh, quite, quite, quite.
I understand entirely about founding a dynasty.
Delightful thing to do.
I've tried myself, many times.
And what have I got?
A daughter.
The true offspring of the mother of miseries.
Her eyes have quarreled.
They're always trying to get at one another.
Her eyes are Babylonian eyes... and her eyebrows like the crescent moon of Ramadan.
- Her body's straight as the letter alif.
- How do you know?
- I've seen her.
- Oh, no, you -
- I have.
- Where?
- In my crystal.
- Oh, confound your crystal.
Confound all crystals.
I always did hate the things. I -
- Are you a magician?
- I have some skill.
Oh, say no more. I -
Anyhow, I - I must have this horse.
So I suppose you must have my daughter.
Mmm.
I will never marry him.
I would rather die.
I will go to my sister, who's married to he sultan of Samarkand.
She will protect me.
Go back to the garden. You will find someone there whom we thought was the djinni of the pool.
Tell him of our misfortune, and tell him that I will wait for him in Samarkand.
Yes, Princess.
Your Highness, the princess is nowhere to be found.
She is gone. We have searched
the whole garden.
- We have found only two beggars.
- Bring them here.
Jaffar! Jaffar!
Jaffar!
At last, face to face, man to man, sword to sword.
Give me a sword!
Allah will judge!
Great sultan, I speak the truth.
My eyes bear witness.
Ahmad!
My eyes!
I'm blind!
Ahmad!
Listen, great sultan,
I know the truth.
You must know who this man is!
And this - Listen, good people.
- Son of a dog.
- Allah.
By this, my magic rune... be what your fathers were... and bay the moon.
And this is my curse:
You shall remain a dog... and you shall walk in the darkness of the blind... until I hold her in my arms.
And now, dispensers of bounty, you know why a blind man with his dog... searches the world for a lost love, and with little enough hope.
Yet without that hope, there would be nothing.
And Allah is merciful.
Allah is merciful indeed, for the one that you seek is here.
If you mock me,
Allah will not forgive.
I do not mock. Your princess was captured by slave traders and sold here in our slave market.
The richest merchant in the town
bought her.
But no sooner was she taken to his house than she fell into the strangest trance.
She lives, but is as dead.
No doctor can restore her.
Night and day she calls upon the djinni of the pool.
- I was that djinni!
- And you alone can bring her back to life.
Can you take me where she is?
O djinni, shall I never see you again?
- Never?
- Lead me to her.
Why have you come?
To find you.
- How long have you been searching?
- From the beginning of time.
Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Till the end of time.
The dream - my dream - always the same dream.
This is no dream.
Ahmad!
Finish the masquerade.
Don't look at me like that.
Suffering has left its mark.
For me, your beauty will always be as I first saw it - never changing.
Your eyes -They're so strange.
So full of pain.
One cannot go through fire and not be scorched.
Ahmad, you must go.
The master has returned.
I will hide you, and when the master sleeps in the heat of the noon...
I'll bring her to you.
Quiet.
From now you're not only mine.
You belong to the princess as well.
Stay and guard her for me.
Blind. He's blind.
It is in your power to restore his sight.
There is, in this town, a famous doctor who would, at your request, cure him.
Take me.
Is the doctor here, on this ship?
Yes. He's waiting for you.
Open this door.
Open it!
Bring him nearer.
Nearer.
How do you find your dog's life, hmm?
Mmm. Strange how an unpleasant child can be a decent dog.
Throw him overboard.
Welcome.
- Jaffar!
- Yes.Jaffar.
It's always Jaffar.
Since you left your palace,
I have kept you safe.
When you rode hopeless and lost in the desert, who guided you?
When you were sold in the slave market,
who bought you♪
Always Jaffar.
It was in my house you were cared for, to sleep your sleep... and dream to its end... your first dream of love.
It was I who woke you.
No. It was Ahmad.
I was told there was a doctor here... who could restore his sight.
But I am that doctor.
The same moment that I hold you in my arms...
Ahmad will see.
Take me in your arms.
My eyes!
Hey! Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Can you see?
I'm Abu again!
Abu!
- Abu, where is she?
- She's with him -Jaffar- on the ship.
What good are my eyes to me without her?
Is there nothing for you without her?
Nothing.
No. No.
I have powers that could force you to my will.
But I want more than they can give.
I want your love.
Forget Ahmad.
He's no longer blind.
And for a man with eyes, the world is full of women.
Only I am cursed... that I can see only you.
Little fool. Trying to end your life before it has begun.
I tell you, Ahmad has forgotten.
Look!
It's Ahmad!
Wind!
Wind!
Wind!
Whip yourself, winds of heaven!
Whip till you wail aloud!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Why do you refuse to obey your destiny?
You behave like a slave girl.
I am a slave girl.
You could command me.
Try. Ask what you will.
Would you take me back to Basra?
- Helmsman!
- Master!
Northward to Basra.
This is a place of desolation.
It is the most beautiful garden in the world.
If there were ever flowers in it, they've vanished, like cancer.
And the pool - so dark with weeds... you can't even see your own reflection in it.
I'm not looking for my own reflection.
Father, I don't want to go to Bagdad with Jaffar.
- But, my dear-
- Don't let him take me.
- Don't!
- Oh, there, there, there, there, there, there.
Well, if you don't want to go to Bagdad with him, you shan't.
No. Never. Never, never, never.
Never while I live. There.
- There. Oh.
What is it?
The newest magical toy: the silver maid.
Does she do anything more?
She can embrace you.
But any of my wives will do that.
Her embrace will thrill you... as no other woman ever has... or ever will.
Do you mean I might get rid of all my wives... and have a collection of these things?
She tickles!
Guards!
Make ready for Bagdad.
Free! Free!
Free! Free! Free!
Free! Free! Free!
Free again!
Free, after 2,000 years!
2,000 years ago,
King Solomon, master of all the djinns... imprisoned me within that bottle.
For me, this is the first moment of my new freedom.
For you -
For you, this is the last moment of your life.
My life?
Your life!
In a moment I shall lift my foot and crush you... insect, beetle, worm that you are!
But, sheik of spirits,
Ifished you out of the sea.
I opened your bottle. I let you out.
You can't be so ungrateful.
Ungrateful?
Slaves are not grateful.
Not for their freedom.
Listen.
Inside my bottle for the first thousand years...
I swore that I'd enrich the one that freed me with all the riches of the earth.
But in the second thousand years, my imprisoned spirit turned to vengeance... on all that lived and were free.
And I swore that I'd kill him that freed me to satisfy that hate.
Are you ready?
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Please, before I die, may I -
May I ask one question?
Ask.
How comes it that you, as big as a mountain... could ever get into that bottle
I can hold in my hand?
You weren't ever in it really, were you?
- Of course I was.
- Oh, no, you weren't.
- I was!
- You weren't!
What? You dare doubt?
If I'm going to die in a moment, I can dare anything, and I say it's impossible.
- Impossible?
- And I don't believe you.
- Take care.
- And never shall.
- Never?
- Nothing can make me!
- Nothing?
- Nothing. Unless I see it with my own eyes.
Then, dog of an unbeliever, before you die... you shall see, with me, nothing is impossible!
You shall see and believe!
Now, you great, overblown belch!
Let me out! Let me out!
Just because you were bigger than me, you thought you could bully.
- Let me out! Let me out!
Product of inflation.
Descendant of a stink. Let you out?
I'm going to throw you back into the sea.
- This time forever.
- Oh, no. Mercy! Mercy, O Master!
- What's that?
- O great and merciful master!
- Say that again.
- O great and merciful master... let me out, and I'll grant you three wishes.
- Three wishes?
- Your first three wishes shall come true.
- You swear?
- I swear.
By King Solomon, master of all the djinn?
By King Solomon, the master of all the djinn... the oath that no spirit can break.
- And you'll behave? No threatening and shouting?
- No.
- No what?
- No, Master.
Now, don't make so much noise again.
You frightened me before.
Master, I hear and obey.
That's better.
All bullies must learn manners in the end.
I'm hungry.
Can't think with my stomach empty.
I wish I had some of those sausages
Mother used to make.
Your sausages, Master.
That was the first wish, Master.
Two more remain.
Name them.
Don't you hurry me.
I've got to be careful.
Two more.
You know what I wish?
Tell me. Where is my friend Ahmad?
Master, to know that, you must look into the All-Seeing Eye.
- Then give me the eye.
- Master, I can take you where it is... but not even I can steal it for you.
Steal? Huh!
I'll see to that.
- Little braggart. What have you ever stolen?
- What haven't I?
A key from its lock, ring from its finger, money from its purse, the strength of a djinni -
And the tongue of a liar!
But he who would steal the All-Seeing Eye... from the very brow of the goddess must be neither a thief nor a braggart, but a hero.
I always wanted to be a hero.
Come on!
Then catch on to my hair.
All right.
But mind you, this is not my second wish yet.
Now I'm rather helping you.
Yes, Master.
Djinni! Djinni!
I'm frightened!
I hear!
All right, Master?
I think so.
Where are we now?
Above the roof of the world.
Has the world got a roof?
Of course, supported by seven pillars.
And the seven pillars are set on the shoulders of a djinni whose strength is beyond thought.
And the djinni stands on an eagle... and the eagle on a bull, and the bull on a fish.
And the fish swims in the Sea of Eternity.
Where are we going?
On the highest peak of the highest mountain of the world... where earth meets the sky, and there is the Temple of the Dawn.
And in the great hall of the temple is the goddess of light.
And in the head of the goddess is the All-Seeing Eye.
And now, my little braggart... you can be a thief and a hero all in one.
A hero.

Djinni, help!
Djinni!
Is this the All-Seeing Eye?
Not for 2,000 years will she grow another.
For a hundred generations of men, she will not know their doings.
- Now shall I know what happened to Ahmad?
- Look.
Look hard.
It's true. It's Ahmad.
Help!
Help!
Help!
- Help!
- Help!
Now my second wish.
Take me to him.
To hear is to obey, little master of the world.
Hold tight, little brother.
We have to return half across the world.
Don't be afraid, Ahmad!
- It's me, Abu!
- Abu!
Put me down!
Put me down!
Gently, you clumsy good-for-nothing!
- Abu!
- Ahmad!
Allah be merciful.
It's a real djinni.
Yes. He's mine, and I am his master.
I am your master, aren't I?
To hear is to obey, O Master!
See? He brought me here, and he'll carry us away.
What's he laughing like that for?
I don't like the sound of it.
Oh, he's all right.
He's a bit big to talk to.
That's the worse part about him.
You have to shout so much.
Hey, you up there!
- What are you laughing for?
- For my freedom. It is at hand.
You get us out of this place.
- Your third wish?
- No, no, no, no.
Not yet.
He is big, but he is sharp.
I've got to be careful.
Only one wish left.
I have only one wish.
Oh, I know all about that.
Your princess.
If only I could see her again.
Is that all?
I don't need to waste a wish for that.
- Look.
- What's that?
Look into it - hard, hard.
Keep staring into it.
You'll see her.
It's true!
A blue rose?
I've heard about that.
That -
That's the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness.
If she inhales its fragrance, she'll forget... everything.
Blue roses?
Exquisite.
Who are you?
I don't know.
I've forgotten.
Why have you suffered?
Have I suffered?
I don't remember.
It seems I was in love.
Whom did you love?
I cannot tell.
I don't know any longer.
I can't look anymore!
There are worse things than blindness.
Knowledge can be more terrible than ignorance, if one can do nothing.
Nothing.
Why did you give me this?
Take it back and break it into a thousand pieces.
I only stole it to help you.
You stole it because you enjoy stealing.
Without my stealing, you'd be dead.
I wish I were dead.
I wish I'd never seen you.
I wish -
I wish I were in Bagdad.
I wish you were!
Ahmad! Ahmad!
Ahmad! Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Where are you?
Where you wished him - on his way to Bagdad.
Then take me out of this place.
Don't you hear? I want to get out.
You stay where you are.
You're a clever little man, little master of the universe... but mortals are weak and frail.
If their stomach speaks, they forget their brain.
If their brain speaks, they forget their hearts.
And if their hearts speak-
If their hearts speak, they forget everything!
Am I not your master?
No longer.
You've had your three wishes, and I am free!
Free!
Djinni! Djinni!
Come back!
Don't leave me here!
Don't let me die! Djinni!
And farewell, little master of the universe.
Farewell! Free!
Free! Free!
Everything of the past is forgotten.
You have been in love with me.
You are in love with me.
You will always love me.
Everything of the past is forgotten.
I have been in love with you.
I am in love with you.
I shall always love you.
Hey!
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
Jaffar!
Ahmad.
Let's go!
Put them in prison.
Chain them to opposite walls.
In the morning, they die the death of a thousand cuts.
I have failed, my love.
Forgive me.
I have no regrets.
We are together.
And shall be for the rest of our lives.
We shall never again know the torture of being apart.
And if death is not the end, we shall go on together.
Abu and I parted quarreling.
I wish I could tell him I'm sorry.
Abu, my friend... good-bye and forgive me.
No. I won't say good-bye.
I'll help.
But how? How?
If I can't help, I won't see!
Welcome, our prince.
Welcome, little prince.
Father of a beard, there's some mistake.
I'm not a prince.
I'm only a thief.
For you we have been waiting twice 2,000 years.
Oh, no. Not waiting for me... because I didn't know I was coming, and I don't know how I've come.
Who are you, father of miracles?
And where am I?
This is the Land of Legend... where everything is possible when seen through the eyes of youth.
We are the remnant of the Golden Age.
Golden because gold was nothing.
No more than the sand beneath your feet...
or the stone that we became.
How did you become stone?
We were petrified with horror... by the evil done among men... when they ceased to be children... and to believe in the beauty of the impossible.
But whenever the heart of a child
returns to us...
and comes into us... we live again.
And so, as that child... you are to be my successor.
Now, come with me... and I will present you with two insignia... of true kingship.
Here they are.
Aim this only at injustice, and you cannot fail.
Oh, no, father of kindness.
I don't want it.
I don't want to be a king.
- I only want to save my friend.
- Well, this will help you.
Take it. And now...
I do homage... for you are king... and all in our kingdom is yours... except that carpet, which I keep for myself.
For on that carpet... which flies when it is bidden -
"Fly, carpet" -
I shall go to paradise
at the hour appointed.
It is told,
though Allah is wiser or more merciful...
there was in the past of the ages
a king among kings...
a master of arms and of armies,
of vessels and auxiliaries.
And this master of time and people
was an oppressor to both...
until the earth was as pitch
on the faces ofhis subjects and his slaves...
and they groaned together in secret...
and were slayed in the marketplace.
But a wise man
among the sages of Bagdad...
comforted them
with a prophecy, saying...
"In the fullness of time,
a liberator shall come upon you...
and this shall be the sign ofhim."
O Allah,
I know you don't much like stealing.
I'll never steal again.
You can trust me.
Just this once more.Just this little carpet so as to get to Bagdad in time.
When the old king's hour comes... he won't want a carpet to fly to paradise.
Then you, O Allah, will take him by the hand... gentle and kind as he is... and lead him into eternal bliss.
Aren't I right?
But I must go to Bagdad to save my friend.
It's a question of minutes.
You must see that.
O Allah, lord ofjustice,
let me steal.
Fly, carpet.
Wait.
Fly, carpet!
Why do you close your eyes?
There's little time left to see him.
The people cried,
"We shall look for him in the clouds indeed...
"for if the great are powerless
to save us from this tyrant...
how can one of no account avail?"
And the reader
of the Milky Way replied...
"Have faith, trust in Allah...
"for there, one day in the blue,
you shall see a boy...
"the lowest of the low,
mounted on a cloud...
"and that cloud shall be as strong
as the hills beneath the snow...
"and from the ranges of the sky...
he shall destroy this tyrant
with the arrow ofjustice."
The horse!
Up, quickly!
Ahmad!
Jaffar!
My people,
I owe everything to Abu... and when he grows into a man, he shall be my grand vizier.
He shall be sent to the best school in Bagdad... and all the wise men of the East shall teach him all the wisdom of the world.
He shall be the wisest of men,
and in those future days... when he will be full of knowledge, science and dignity... he will be the shining example for the youths of Bagdad... and they may remember how the little thief became the dignifi -
Hey! Abu! Where are you going?
You've got what you wanted.
Now, I'm going to find what I want.
- What's that?
- Some fun.
- An adventure at last!
Sweet, juicy oranges.
O for a muse of fire, that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention, a kingdom for a stage, princes to act and monarchs to behold a swelling scene.
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, assume the port of Mars.
And, at his heels, leashed in like hounds, would famine, sword and fire crouch for employment.
But pardon, gentles all, the flat, unraised spirits that hath dared on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth so great an object.
Can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?
Or may we cram, within this wooden O, the very casques that did affright the air at Agincourt?
On your imaginary forces work.
Suppose, within the girdle of these walls, are now confined two mighty monarchies whose high upreared and abutting fronts the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.
Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them printing their proud hoofs in the receiving earth.
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings, carry them here and there, jumping o'er times, turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass - for the which supply admit me, Chorus, to this history, who prologue-like, your humble patience pray... gently to hear, kindly to judge our play.
My lord, I'll tell you.
That same bill is urged which, in the eleventh year of the last king's reign, was likely to have been against us passed, but that the scambling and unquiet times did push it out of further question.
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
It must be thought on.
If it pass against us, we lose the better half of our possession, for all those temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the Church, would they strip from us - thus runs the bill.
- This would drink deep.
- 'Twould drink the cup and all.
By what prevention?
The King is full of grace and fair regard.
And a true lover of the holy Church.
The courses of his youth promised it not, since his addiction was to courses vain, his companies unlettered, rude and shallow, his hours filled up with banquets, riots, sports, and never noted in him any study.
And so the prince obscured his contemplations under the veil of wildness, which grew, no doubt, like the summer grass, fastest by night.
The breath no sooner left his father's body but that the wildness, mortified in him, seemed to die too.
Sir John Falstaff...
...and all his company along with him, he banished...
...under pain of death, not to come near his person...
...by ten miles!
Yea, at that very moment, consideration like an angel came and whipped the offending Adam out of him.
Never was such a sudden scholar made, never came reformation in a flood as in this king.
We are blessed in the change.
"We are blessed in the change"!
My good lord, how now for mitigation of this bill urged by the Commons?
Doth his majesty incline to it, or no?
He seems indifferent, or rather swaying more upon our part, for I have made an offer to his majesty, as touching France, to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal.
How did this offer seem received, my lord?
Of good acceptance of his majesty, save that there was not time enough to hear, as I perceived his grace would fain have done, of his true title to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of France, derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
What was the impediment that broke this off?
The French ambassador upon that instant craved audience...
...and I think the hour is come to give him hearing.
Is it four o'clock?
- It is.
- Then go we in to hear his embassy, which I could with a ready guess declare before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
I'll wait upon you and I long to hear it.
Where is my gracious
Lord of Canterbury?
- Not here in presence.
- Send for him, good uncle.
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolved before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thoughts, concerning us and France.
God and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it.
Sure, we thank you.
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the Law Salic that they have in France or should, nor should not, bar us in our claim.
We charge you in the name of God, take heed how you awake the sleeping sword of war.
For never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops do make such waste in brief mortality.
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers that owe your lives, your faith, your services to this imperial throne.
There is no bar to make against Your Highness' claim to France but this, which they produce from Pharamond.
"In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant" -
No woman shall succeed in Salic land - which Salic land the French unjustly gloze to be the realm of France.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land Salic lies in Germany, between the floods of Saale and of Elbe, where, Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons, there left behind and settled certain French who, holding in disdain the German women for some dishonest manners of their life...
...established there this law - to whit, no female should be inheritrix in Salic land, which is this day in Germany called Meissen.
Then doth it well appear the Salic Law was not devised for the realm of France.
Nor did the French possess the Salic land until four hundred one-and-twenty years after defunction of King...
...Pharamond, idly supposed the founder of this law.
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric, did, as heir general, being descended...
...of Blithild...
...who was daughter to...
...King Clotaire, made claim and title to the throne of France.
Hugh Capet also, which usurped the crown...
Er...
...of Charles, the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male of the true line and stock of...
...of Charles the Great, could not keep quiet in his conscience, wearing the crown of France, till satisfied that fair... that fair... that fair...
Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was lineal of the Lady... of the Lady... of the Lady... of the Lady Ermengarde, daughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorraine.
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun...
...all hold in right and title of the female.
So do the kings of France unto this day, howbeit they would hold up this Salic Law to bar Your Highness claiming from the female.
May I with right and conscience make this claim?
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign, for in the Book of Numbers it is writ,
"When the son die, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter. "
Gracious lord, stand your own.
Look back into your mighty ancestors.
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb from whom you claim.
Invoke his warlike spirit, and your great-uncle's,
Edward the Black Prince.
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood.
They know your grace hath cause and means and might.
So hath Your Highness.
Never king of England had nobles richer or more loyal subjects, whose hearts have left their bodies here in England and lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
O let their bodies follow, my dear liege, with blood and sword and fire, to win your right.
In aid whereof, we of the spiritualty will raise Your Highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors.
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
Now are we well resolved, and by God's help and yours, the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours we'll bend it to our awe or lay these bones in an unworthy urn, tombless, with no remembrance over them.
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin, for we hear your greeting is from him, not from the king.
May it please Your Majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge, or shall we sparingly show you far off the Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
We are no tyrant, but a Christian King, therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the Dauphin's mind.
Thus then in few.
Your Highness lately sending into France did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right of your great predecessor,
King Edward the Third.
In answer to which claim, the Prince our master says that you savour too much of your youth.
He therefore sends you, fitter for your study, this tun of treasure, and in lieu of this desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you.
This the Dauphin speaks.
What treasure, Uncle?
Tennis balls, my liege.
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.
His present and your pains we thank you for.
When we have matched our rackets to these balls, we will in France, by God's grace, play a set shall strike his father's crown into the hazard!
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of France will be disturbed with chases.
And we understand him well, how he comes o'er us with our wilder days, not measuring what use we made of them.
But tell the Dauphin we will keep our state, be like a king, and show our sail of greatness when we do rouse us in our throne of France.
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turned these balls to gunstones and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them, for many a thousand widows shall this his mock, mock out of their dear husbands, mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down.
Ay, some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
But this lies all within the will of God, to whom we do appeal and in whose name tell you the Dauphin we are coming on to venge us as we may, and to put forth our rightful claim in a well-hallowed cause, so get you hence in peace.
And tell the Dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Convey them with safe conduct.
Fare you well.
- This was a merry message.
- We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore let our proportion for these wars be soon collected, and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings, for, God before, we'll check this Dauphin at his father's door.
Now all the youth of England are on fire, and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought reigns solely in the breast of every man.
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse, following the mirror of all Christian kings with winged heels, as English Mercuries.
For now sits expectation in the air and hides a sword from hilt unto the point with crowns imperial, crowns and coronets, promised to Harry and his followers.
Linger your patience on, for if we may, we'll not offend one stomach with our play.
Well met, Corporal Nym.
Oh. Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
What, are Ensign Pistol and you friends yet?
For my part, I care not. I say little.
But when time shall serve...
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends, and we'll all go three sworn brothers to France.
Let it be so, good Corporal Nym.
Well, I cannot tell.
Oh, it is certain that he is married to Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you were betrothed to her.
Things must be as they may.
Men may sleep, they may have their throats about them at that time.
- Some say knives have edges.
- Oh!
Well, I cannot tell.
Here comes Pistol and his wife.
Good corporal, be patient here.
How now, mine host Pistol?
Base tike...
...call'st thou me host?
Now, by this hand,
I swear I scorn the title.
Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.
No, by my troth, not long, for we cannot lodge or board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles but it will be thought we keep a bawdy house. Straight.
O hound of Crete, thinks't thou my spouse to get?
I have, and I will hold, my honey queen.
And there's enough. Go to.
I would prick your guts a little, and that's the truth of it.
O well-a-day, Lady! We shall have wilful murder and adultery committed.
Good corporal, good lieutenant, offer nothing here.
- Pish.
- Pish for thee, Iceland dog.
Thou prick-eared cur of Iceland.
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, put up thy sword.
I will cut thy throat one time or another, in fair terms.
I can take. Now Pistol's cock is up, and flashing fire will follow.
Hear me, hear me what I say.
He that strikes the first stroke,
I'll run him up to the hilts, as I-I-I am a soldier.
An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
Mine host Pistol, you must come to Sir John Falstaff, and you, hostess.
He's very sick and would to bed.
Good Bardolph, put thy nose between his sheets and do the office of a warming-pan.
- Away, you rogue.
- Faith, he's very ill.
By my troth, the King hath killed his heart.
Good husband, come home presently.
Come, shall I make you two friends?
We must to France together.
Why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another's throats?
Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on.
You'll pay me the eight shillings
I won off you at betting?
Base is the slave that pays.
Now that will I have.
That's the humour of it.
As manhood shall compound.
Push home.
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll kill him.
By this s-s-s-sword I will.
"This s-s-s-s-sword".
And oaths must have their course.
Corporal Nym and thou wilt be friends, be friends.
An thou wilt not, why then be enemies of me too? Prithee, put up.
As ever you come of women, come quickly to Sir John.
He's so shaked of a burning contigion fever, it's lamentable to behold.
Sweet men, come to him.
The King hath run bad humours on the knight.
Nym, thou hast spoke the right.
His heart is fractured and corroborate.
The King is a good king, but it must be as it may.
He passes some humours.
Let us condole the knight.
For, lambkins, we will live.
Linger your patience on and we'll digest the abuse of distance, force a play.
The King is set from London and the scene is now transported, gentles, to Southampton.
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit, and thence to France shall we convey you safe and bring you back, charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass.
But here, till then, unto Southampton do we change our scene.
# Amen #
Now sits the wind fair.
Uncle of Exeter, set free the man committed yesterday that railed against our person.
We consider it was the heat of wine that set him on, and on his wiser thought we pardon him.
- That's mercy, but too much security.
- Let him be punished, sovereign, lest example breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
O let us yet be merciful.
We doubt not now but every rub is smoothed on our way.
Then forth, dear countrymen.
Let us deliver our puissance into the hand of God, putting it straight in expedition.
- Cheerly to sea.
- Hurrah!
- The signs of war advance!
- Hurrah!
No King of England, if not King of France!
Still be kind and eke out our performance... with your mind.
God save thy grace, King Hal.
My royal Hal. God save thee, my sweet boy.
My King, my Jove,
I speak to thee my heart.
I know thee not, old man.
Fall to thy prayers.
How ill white hairs become a fool and jester.
I have long dreamed of such a kind of man, so surfeit-swelled, so old and so profane.
But being awaked,
I do despise my dream.
Reply not to me with a foolish jest, presume not that I am the thing I was.
For God doth know, so shall the world perceive that I have turned away my former self, so shall I those that kept me company.
Prithee, honey sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.
No, for my manly heart doth yearn.
Bardolph, be blithe.
Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.
Boy, bristle thy courage up.
For Falstaff he is dead, and we must yearn therefore.
Well, Sir John is gone, God be with him.
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in heaven or in hell.
Nay, he's not in hell.
He's in Arthur's bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom.
He made a finer end and went away an it had been any christom child.
He parted e'en just betwixt twelve and one, e'en at the turning of the tide.
When I saw him fumble with the sheets, play with flowers, smile upon his finger ends,
I knew there was no way but one.
For his nose was as sharp as a pen.
And he babbled of green fields.
"How now, Sir John?" quoth I.
"What, man, be of good cheer. "
So he cried out, "Gone, gone, gone," three or four times.
Now I, to comfort him, bid him he should not think on God.
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet.
So he bade me lay more clothes on his feet.
I put my hand in the bed and felt them.
They were as cold as any stone.
Then I felt to his knees and they were as cold as any stone.
And so... upwards... and upwards... and all was cold as any stone.
They say he cried out for sack.
Ay, he did that.
- And for women.
- Ay.
- That he did not.
- Ay, that he did.
And he said they were devils incarnate.
He said once the devil would have him about women.
He did in some sort, indeed, handle women, but then he was rheumatic.
He spoke of the Whore of Babylon.
Do you not remember, he saw a flea stand on Bardolph's nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell-fire?
Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire.
That's all the riches I got in his service.
Shall we go? The King will be gone from Southampton.
Come, let us away.
My love, give me thy lips.
Look to my chattels and my movables.
Go, clear thy crystals.
Yoke-fellows in arms, let us to France.
Like horse-leeches my boys, to suck, to suck, the very blood to suck.
Touch her soft lips, and part.
Farewell, hostess.
I cannot kiss, that's the humour of it, but... adieu.
Let housewifery appear.
Keep close, I thee command.
Farewell, farewell, divine Zenocrate.
Is it not passing brave to be a king and ride in triumph through Persepolis?
Thus, with imagined wing, our scene flies swift as that of thought.
Suppose that you have seen the well-appointed King at Hampton Pier embark his royalty and his brave fleet.
Play on your fancies, and in them behold upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing.
Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give to sounds confused.
Behold the threaden sails, borne with the invisible and creeping wind, draw the huge vessels through the furrowed seas, breasting the lofty surge.
O do but think you stand upon the shore, and then behold a city on the inconstant billows dancing, holding due course to Harfleur.
Follow, follow, and leave your England, as dead midnight still, guarded with grandsires, babies and old women.
For who is he, whose chin is but enriched with one appearing hair, that will not follow these culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
The French, advised by good intelligence of this most dreadful preparation, shake in their fear, and with pale policy, seek to divert the English purposes.
Thus comes the English with full power upon us.
And more than carefully it us concerns to answer royally in our defences.
Therefore you Dukes of Berri... and of Bourbon,
Lord Constable and Orléans, shall make forth.
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch to line and new-repair our towns of war with men of... courage and with means... defendant.
My most redoubted father, it is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe, and let us do it with no show of fear, no, with no more than if we heard that England were busied with a Whitsun morris dance.
For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged, so guided by a shallow, humorous youth, that fear attends her not.
O peace, Prince Dauphin.
You are too much mistaken in this king.
Question, your grace, our late ambassadors with what great state he heard their embassy, how well supplied with aged counsellors, how terrible in constant resolution.
Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
But though we think it so, it is no matter.
In cases of defence, 'tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems.
And he is bred out of that bloody strain that haunted us in our familiar paths, when Crécy battle fatally was struck, and all our princes captive by the hand of that black name,
Edward, Black Prince of Wales.
This is a stem of that victorious stock, and let us fear the native mightiness... and fate of him.
Ambassadors from Harry,
King of England, do crave admittance to Your Majesty.
We'll give them present audience.
Go and bring them.
Good my sovereign, take up the English short, and let them know of what a monarchy you are the head.
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting.
From our brother England?
From him, and thus he greets Your Majesty.
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty, that you divest yourself and lay apart the borrowed glories that by gift of heaven, by law of nature and of nations,
'longs to him and to his heirs, namely the crown.
Willing you over-look this pedigree, and when you find him evenly derived from his most famed of famous ancestors,
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom, indirectly held from him, the native and true challenger.
If not, what follows?
Bloody constraint.
For if you hide the crown even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming, in thunder and in earthquake like a Jove, that if requiring fail, he will compel.
This is his claim, his threatening, and my message... unless the Dauphin be in presence here, to whom expressly I bring greeting too.
For us, we will consider of this further.
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent back to our brother England.
For the Dauphin, I stand here for him.
What to him from England?
Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt, and anything that may not misbecome the mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Thus says my King.
And if your father's highness do not, in grant of all demands at large, sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty, he'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it.
Tomorrow shall you know our... mind at full.
Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king come here himself to question our delay.
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege!
Behold the ordnance on their carriages, with fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
Once more... unto the breach, dear friends, once more, or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility.
But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger.
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, disguise fair nature with hard-favoured rage.
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect, let it pry through the portage of the head like a brass cannon.
Let the brow o'erwhelm it as fearfully as doth a galled rock o'er hang and jutty his confounded base, swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height.
On, on, you noblest English, whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof, fathers that like so many Alexanders have in these parts from morn till even fought, and sheathed their swords for lack of argument.
Dishonour not your mothers.
Now attest that those whom you call fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war.
And you, good yeomen, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture.
Let us swear that you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not, for there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start.
The game's afoot. Follow your spirit, and upon this charge cry, "God for Harry,
England and Saint George!"
God for Harry,
England and Saint George!
God for Harry, England and Saint George!
On, on! To the breach! To the...
Pray thee corporal, stay.
The knocks are too hot.
Ah, knocks, they come and go,
God's vassals drop and die, and sword and shield, in bloody field, both win immortal fame.
'Tis honour, and that's the truth of it.
Would I were in an alehouse in London.
I'd give all my fame for a pot of ale, and safety.
God's plud! Up to the breach, you dogs!
Avaunt, you cullions!
Ah!
Ah! Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.
Ah! Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage!
The nimble gunner with linstock now the devilish cannon touches.
And down goes all before it!
Captain Fluellen!
Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines.
The Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
To the mines?
Tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines.
For look you, the mines is not according to the disciplines of war.
The concavities of it is not sufficient.
For look you, the adversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look you, is digt himself four yards under the countermines.
I think he will blow up all if there is not better directions.
The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i'faith.
- Mm. It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
- I think it be.
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world.
I will verify as much in his beard.
He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy dog.
- Here he comes.
- Bah!
And the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.
Ah! Captain Jamy is a marvellous, valorous gentleman, that is certain, of great expedition and knowledge in the ancient wars.
I say good day, Captain Fluellen.
Good e'en to your worship, good Captain James.
Good day. Put it there.
Captain Jamy is a marvellous, valorous gentleman, that is certain.
How now, Captain Macmorris, have you quit the mines?
Have the pioneers given o'er?
O, by the saints,
'tis ill done.
The work is give over, the trumpet sound the retreat.
By my hand, I swear, and by my father's soul, 'tis ill done.
The work is give over.
I would have blowed up the town, so God save me, in an hour.
Ah, 'tis ill done.
By my hand, 'tis ill done.
Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you vouchsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you?
Partly to satisfy my opinion and partly for the satisfaction, look you, of my mind.
As touching the direction of the military disciplines, that is the point.
It shall be very good, good faith, good captains both.
And I would fain hear some discourse between you twain.
This is no time to discourse, so God save me.
No, the day is hot, and the weather and the wars and the King and the dukes.
This is no time to discourse.
The town is beseeched.
Ay, the trumpet call us into the breach and we talk and, by the Holy, do nothing!
'Tis a shame for us all, so God save me.
'Tis a shame to stand still.
'Tis a shame by my hand.
And there is throats to be cut, and work to be done, and nothing is done, save me, God.
By the mess, ere these eyes o' mine take themselves to slumber,
I'll do good service, or I'll lie i' the ground for it, ay, or go to death.
And I'll pay it as valorously as I may.
That shall I surely do.
That is the brief and the long of it.
Mm?
Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your correction, there is not many... of your nation.
Of my nation?
What is my nation?
Is a villain and bastard and a knave and a rascal?
What is my nation?
Who talks of my nation?
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me, look you, being as good a man as yourself, both in the discipline of war and in the derivation of my birth, and other particularities.
I do not know you as good a man as myself, so God save me, and I will cut off your head!
Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
That's a foul fault.
- The town sounds a parley!
- Hooray!
How yet resolves the governor of the town?
This is the latest parley we'll admit.
Our expectation hath this day an end.
The Dauphin, of whom succour we entreated, returns us word his powers are not yet ready to raise so great a siege.
Therefore, dread King, we yield our town and lives to your soft mercy.
Enter our gates, dispose of us and ours, for we no longer are defensible.
Open your gates.
Come, brother Gloucester.
Go you and enter Harfleur.
There remain and fortify it strongly against the French.
Use mercy to them all.
For us, dear brother, the winter coming on and sickness growing upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest.
Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.
Alice, tu as été en Angleterre, et tu parles bien le langage.
Ooh, un peu, madame.
Je te prie, m'enseignez.
Il faut que j'apprenne à parler.
Comment appelez-vous "la main" en anglais?
La main? Elle est appelée "ze hand".
De hand. Et "les doigts"?
Les doigts? Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts, mais je me souviendrai.
Les doigts. Ah, je pense qu'ils sont appelés "ze fingres".
Oui. Ze fingeurs.
La main, de hand. Les doigts, de fingers.
Je pense que je suis la bonne écolier.
Je gagne deux mots d'anglais vitement.
- Comment appelez-vous "les ongles"?
- Les ongles.
Nous les appelons "the nails".
De nails. Écoutez.
Dites-moi si je parle bien.
De hand. De fingers. De nails.
Ah, c'est bien dit, madame.
Il est fort bon anglais.
- Dites-moi I'anglais pour "le bras".
- "Ze arm", madame.
- Et "le coude"?
- "The elbow".
De elbow.
Je m'en fais la répétition de tous les mots que vous m'avez appris dès à présent.
Ça c'est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.
Excusez-moi, Alice. Écoutez. De hand, de fingers, de nails, de arm, de bilbow.
Sauf votre honneur, de "elbow".
O Seigneur Dieu, je m'en oublie.
De elbow.
- Comment appelez-vous "le col"?
- "The nick".
De nick. Et "le menton"?
- "The chin".
- De sin.
Le col, de nick. Le menton, de sin.
Sauf votre honneur, en vérité vous prononcez les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.
Je ne doute point d'apprendre, par la grâce de Dieu, et un peu de temps.
N'avez-vous pas déjà oublié ce que je vous ai enseigné?
Non. Je réciterai à vous promptement.
- De hand, de fingers, de mails...
- The nails, madame.
De nails. De arm. De bilbows.
- Sauf votre honneur, de elbow.
- Ainsi dis-je. De elbow.
De nick et de sin.
Comment appelez-vous
"le pied" et "la robe"?
"The foot" et "cown".
O Seigneur Dieu! Ils sont les most de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et non pour les dames d'honneur d'user.
Je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France pour tout le monde.
Foh! De foot et de cown.
Néanmoins, je réciterai encore une fois ma leÇon ensemble.
De hand, de fingers, de nails, de arm, de elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot et de cown.
Ooh, madame, c'est excellent!
C'est assez pour une fois.
Allons-nous à dîner.
'Tis certain he hath passed the River Somme.
And if he be not fought withal, my lord, let us not live in France.
Let us quit all and give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
Normans, but dastard Normans.
Norman bastards.
Mort de ma vie.
If they march along unfought withal, then I will sell my dukedom to buy a slobbery and dirty farm in that nook-shotten isle of Albion.
Dieu de batailles!
Where have they this mettle?
Is not the climate foggy, raw and dull on whom as in despite the sun looks pale, killing their fruit with frowns?
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine, seem frosty?
By faith and honour, our madams mock at us and plainly say our mettle is bred out and they will give their bodies to the lust of English youth, to new-store France with bastard warriors.
Where is Mountjoy the herald?
Speed him hence.
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
Up, princes, and with spirit of honour edged bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land with pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur.
Go down upon him, you have power enough, and in a captive chariot into Rouen bring him our prisoner.
This becomes the great.
Sorry am I his numbers are so few, his soldiers sick and famished in their march.
For I am sure when he shall see our army he'll drop his heart into the sink of fear and, for achievement, offer us his ransom.
Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Mountjoy.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
- Not so, I do beseech Your Majesty.
- Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
Now forth, Lord Constable, and princes all, and quickly bring us word of England's fall.
You know me by my habit.
Well then, I know thee.
What shall I know of thee?
- My master's mind.
- Unfold it.
Thus says my king,
"Say thou to Harry of England,
"though we seemed dead, we did but slumber.
"Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur,
"but we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe.
"Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial.
"England shall repent his folly, see his weakness,
"and admire our sufferance.
"Bid him therefore consider of his ransom,
"which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost,
"the disgrace we have digested.
"For our losses, his exchequer is too poor.
"For the effusion of our blood,
"the muster of his kingdom too faint a number.
"And for our disgrace, his own person kneeling at our feet
"but a weak and worthless satisfaction.
"To this add defiance, and tell him for conclusion
"he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. "
So far my King and master, so much my office.
- What is thy name? I know thy quality.
- Mountjoy.
Thou dost thy office fairly.
Turn thee back and tell thy king I do not seek him now, but could be willing to march on to Calais without impeachment.
For to say the sooth, my people are with sickness much enfeebled, my numbers lessened.
Go, therefore, tell thy master here I am.
My ransom is this frail and worthless body, my army but a weak and sickly guard.
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on, though France herself and such another neighbour is stood in our way.
If we may pass, we will.
If we be hindered, we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolour.
And so, Mountjoy, fare you well.
We would not seek a battle as we are, nor as we are we say we will not shun it.
So tell your master.
I shall deliver so.
- There's for thy labour, Mountjoy.
- Thanks to Your Highness.
- March to the bridge.
- The bridge!
It now draws toward night.
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves.
And on the morrow bid them march away.
Now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night, the hum of either army stilly sounds, that the fixed sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each other's watch.
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames each battle sees the other's umbered face.
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs piercing the night's dull ear.
And from the tents the armourers, accomplishing the knights, with busy hammers closing rivets up, give dreadful note of preparation.
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul, the confident and over-lusty French do the low-rated English play at dice, and chide the cripple tardy-gaited night, who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp so tediously away.
Tut, I have the best armour of the world.
Would it were day.
You have an excellent armour, but let my horse have his due.
It is the best horse of Europe.
Hm.
Will it never be morning?
My Lord of Orléans, my Lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armour?
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
What a long night is this.
I will not change my horse for any that treads on four hooves.
Ah ha! He bounds from the earth.
When I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk.
He trots the air, the earth sings when he touches it.
He is of the colour of nutmeg and of the heat of the ginger.
He is pure air and fire, and all other jades you may call beasts.
It is indeed, my lord, a most absolute and excellent... horse.
It is the prince of palfreys.
His neigh is like the bidding of a monarch
- and his countenance enforces homage.
- No more, cousin.
Nay, cousin, the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey.
I once writ a sonnet in his praise, and began thus -
"Wonder of nature... "
Ahem. I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.
Methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back.
My Lord Constable, the armour that I see in your tent tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?
- Stars, my lord.
- Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.
That may be.
Will it never be day?
I will trot tomorrow a mile and my way shall be paved with English faces.
Who will go hazard with me for 20 prisoners?
'Tis midnight.
I'll go arm myself.
The Dauphin longs for morning.
Hm.
He longs to eat the English.
I think he will eat all he kills.
Ho-ho, he never did harm that I heard of.
Nor will do none tomorrow.
He'll keep that good name still.
I know him to be valiant.
I was told that by one that knows him better than you.
- What's he?
- Marry, he told me so himself.
And he said he cared not who knew it.
My Lord High Constable, the English lie within 1500 paces of your tents.
Who hath measured the ground?
The Lord Grandpré.
A valiant and most expert gentleman.
Would it were day.
Alas, poor Harry of England.
He longs not for the dawning as we do.
Huh. What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so far out of his knowledge.
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
That they lack, for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy headpieces.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.
Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples.
You may as well say,
"That's a valiant flea
"that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion. "
Just. Just. And the men are like the mastiffs.
Give them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they'll eat like wolves and fight like devils.
But these English are shrewdly out of beef.
Hm. Then shall we find tomorrow they've only stomachs to eat and none to fight.
Hm. Now is it time to arm.
Come. Shall we about it?
It is now two o'clock.
But let me see - by ten, we shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll and the third hour of drowsy morning name.
The poor, condemned English, like sacrifices, by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the morning's danger.
And their gesture sad, investing lank, lean cheeks and war-worn coats, presenteth them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts.
O now, who will behold the royal captain of this ruined band walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent, let him cry, "Praise and glory on his head. "
For forth he goes and visits all his host, bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.
A largesse universal, like the sun, his liberal eye doth give to everyone, thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all behold, as may unworthiness define, a little touch of Harry in the night.
Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger.
The greater therefore should our courage be.
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good, soft pillow for that good, white head were better than a churlish turf of France.
Not so, my liege.
This lodging suits me better, since I may say, "Now lie I like a king. "
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.
I and my bosom must debate awhile, and then I would no other company.
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry.
God-a-mercy, old heart.
Qui va là?
A friend.
Discuss unto me - art thou officer?
Or art thou base, common and popular?
I am a gentleman of a company.
Trail'st thou the puissant pike?
- Even so. What are you?
- As good a gentleman as the emperor.
- Then you are better than the King.
- Ah.
The King's a bawcock and a heart-of-gold, a lad of life, an imp of fame, of parents good, of fist most valiant.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heartstring
I love the lovely bully.
- What is thy name?
- Henry le roi.
Leroi? A Cornish name.
Art thou of Cornish crew?
No, I'm a Welshman.
- Know'st thou Fluellen?
- Yes.
- Art thou his friend?
- Ay, and his kinsman, too.
Well, tell him I'll knock his leek about his head upon Saint Davy's day.
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day, lest he knock that about yours.
- A figo for thee, then.
- I thank you. God be with you.
My name is Pistol called.
It sorts well with your fierceness.
Captain Fluellen?
- Captain Fluellen?
- Shh! Shh!
In the name of Beelzebub, speak lower.
If you will take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall find, I warrant you, there is no tittle-tattle nor pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp.
I warrant you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the cares of it, and the forms of it, to be otherwise.
Why, the enemy is loud.
You can hear him all night.
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also, look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb?
- Shh.
- In your own conscience now?
I will speak lower.
I pray you and beseech you that you will.
Though it appear a little out of fashion, there is much care and valour in this Welshman.
Brother John Bates, be not that the morning which breaks yonder?
I think it be. But we have no great cause to desire the approach of day.
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it.
Who goes there?
A friend.
Under what captain serve you?
Under... Sir Thomas Erpingham.
Oh. A good old commander and a most kind gentleman.
I pray you, what thinks he of our estate?
Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the next tide.
He hath not told his thought to the King?
No. Nor it is not meet he should.
For I think the King is but a man, as I am.
The violet smells to him as it doth to me.
His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man.
Therefore, when he sees reasons of fears, as we do, his fears, without doubt, be of the same relish as ours are.
Yet no man should find in him any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.
He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he'd wish himself in Thames up to the neck.
So I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King.
I think he would not wish himself anywhere... but where he is.
Then I would he were here alone.
So should he be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.
Methinks... I would not die anywhere so contented as in the King's company, his cause being just and his quarrel honourable.
It's more than we know.
Ay.
Or more than we should seek after.
For we know enough if we know we are the King's subjects.
If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.
But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads... chopped off in a battle shall join together at the latter day, and cry all, "We died at such a place," some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left.
I'm afraid there are few die well that die in a battle, for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when blood is their argument?
Now, if these men do not die well, it'll be a black matter for the King that led them to it.
Ay.
So, if a son that is by his father sent upon merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father, that sent him.
But this is not so.
The King is not bound to answer for the particular endings of his soldiers, nor the father of his son, for they purpose not their deaths when they purpose their services.
Every subject's duty is the King's, but every subject's soul is his own.
'Tis certain. Every man that dies ill, the ill's on his own head.
The King's not to answer for it.
I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
I myself heard the King say he would not be ransomed.
He said so to make us fight cheerfully, for when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed and we ne'er the wiser.
If ever I live to see it,
I'll never trust his word after.
That's a perilous shot out of a pop-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch.
You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in its face with a peacock's feather.
You'll never trust his word after.
- Come, 'tis a foolish saying.
- Your reproof is something too round.
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient.
Let it be a quarrel between us, then, if you live.
Be friends, you English fools.
We have French quarrels enough if you could tell how to reckon.
Never trust in his word, I say.
Upon the King.
Let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives, our children... and our sins lay on the King.
We must bear all.
What infinite heartsease must kings forego that private men enjoy?
And what have kings that privates have not too, save ceremony?
And what art thou, thou idol ceremony, that sufferest more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet, but poisoned flattery?
O be sick, great greatness, and bid thy ceremony give thee cure.
Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee, command the health of it?
No, thou proud dream that play'st so subtly with a king's repose.
I am a king that find thee, and I know 'tis not the orb and sceptre, crown imperial, the throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world.
Not all these, laid in bed majestical, can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave who, with a body filled and vacant mind, gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread.
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell, but like a lackey from the rise to set sweats in the eye of Phoebus, and all night sleeps in Elysium.
Next day, after dawn doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse, and follows so the ever-running year with profitable labour to his grave.
And but for ceremony, such a wretch, winding up days with toil and nights with sleep, had the forehand and vantage of a king.
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, seek through your camp to find you.
Good old knight.
# Amen #
Collect them all together at my tent.
I'll be before thee.
O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.
Possess them not with fear.
Take from them now the sense of reckoning, lest the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them.
My Lord.
My Lord, the army stays upon your presence.
I know thy errand.
I will go with thee.
The day, my friends, and all things... stay for me.
The sun doth gild our armour!
Up, my lords!
Montez à cheval.
Ah, my horse. Varlet, lacquais.
- O, brave spirit!
- Via les eaux et la terre!
- We have wind! L'air et le feu!
- Ciel, cousin Orléans.
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh.
Mount them and make incision in their hides that their hot blood may spin in English eyes and quench them with superior courage.
The English are embattled, you French peers.
A very little little let us do and all is done.
Then let the trumpets sound the tucket sonance and the note to mount.
Come, come away.
The sun is high and we outwear the day.
Where is the King?
The King himself is rode to view their battle.
Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand.
There's five to one.
Besides, they all are fresh.
God's arm strike with us.
'Tis a fearful odds.
Well, God with you, princes all.
I'll to my charge.
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven, then joyfully, my noble Westmoreland, my dear Lord Gloucester, my good Lord Exeter and my kind kinsmen, warriors all, adieu.
Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee.
Farewell, kind lord.
O that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in England that do not work today.
What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland?
No, my fair cousin.
If we are marked to die, we are enough to do our country loss, and if to live, the fewer men, the greater share of honour.
God's will, I pray thee wish not one man more.
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host that he which hath no stomach to this feast, let him depart.
His passport shall be drawn and crowns for convoy put into his purse.
We would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is called the Feast of Crispian.
He that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand a-tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall live this day and see old age will yearly, on the vigil, feast his neighbours and say,
"Tomorrow is Saint Crispian. "
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say,
"These wounds I had on Crispin's Day. "
Old men forget.
Yet all shall be forgot, but he'll remember, with advantages, what feats he did that day.
Then shall our names, familiar in his mouth as household words -
Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot,
Salisbury and Gloucester - be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.
This story shall the good man teach his son, and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered.
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.
For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother, be he ne'er so base.
And gentlemen in England now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here, and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Crispin's Day!
My lord, bestow yourself with speed.
The French are bravely in their battles set and will with all expedience charge on us.
All things are ready if our minds be so.
Perish the man whose mind is backward now.
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
God's will, my liege, would you and I alone could fight this battle out.
You know your places.
God be with you all!
Once more I come to know thee,
King Harry.
If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound before thy most assured overthrow.
- Who hath sent thee now?
- The Constable of France.
I pray thee bear my former answer back.
Bid them achieve me, and then sell my bones.
Good God, why should they mock poor fellows thus?
The man that once did sell the lion's skin while the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves, upon the which, I trust, shall witness live in brass of this day's work.
And those that leave their valiant bones in France, dying like men, though buried in your dunghills they shall be famed.
For there the sun shall greet them and draw their honours reeking up to heaven, leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime, the smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
Let me speak proudly.
Tell the Constable we are but warriors for the working day.
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched with rainy marching in the painful field.
And time hath worn us into slovenry.
But by the mass, our hearts are in the trim.
Hooray!
Come now no more for ransom, gentle herald.
They shall have none, I swear, but these my bones, which if they have as I will leave 'em them, shall yield them little. Tell the Constable.
I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well.
Thou never shalt hear herald any more.
Now, soldiers, march away.
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day.
Well have we done, thrice-valiant countrymen!
But all's not done - yet keep the French the field.
O everlasting shame!
Let's stab ourselves.
Be these the wretches that we played at dice for?
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?
Shame on thee, Colonel, shame.
Nothing but shame. Let's die in honour.
- Once more back again.
- We are enough yet living in the field to smother up the English if any order might be thought upon.
The devil take order now.
I'll to the throng.
Let life be short, else shame will be too long.
Odd's blood.
Kill the boys and the luggage!
'Tis expressly against the law of arms!
'Tis as arrant a piece of knavery, mark you now, as can be offered.
In your conscience now, is it not?
'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive.
The cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this slaughter.
Here comes His Majesty.
I was not angry since I came to France... until this instant.
Take a trumpet, herald. Ride thou unto the horsemen on yonder hill.
If they won't fight with us, bid them come down, or void the field.
They do offend our sight!
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
God's will.
What means this, herald?
Comest thou again for ransom?
No, great King. I come to thee for charitable licence, that we may wander o'er this bloody field to book our dead and then to bury them.
The day is yours.
Praised be God, and not our strength, for it.
What is this castle called that stands hard by?
We call it Agincourt.
Then... call we this the field of Agincourt, fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
# Our King went forth to Normandy
# With grace and might of chivalry
# There God for him wrought marvellously
# Wherefore England... #
Here is the number of the slaughtered French.
This note doth tell me of ten thousand
French that in the field lie slain.
Where is the number of our English dead?
Edward, the Duke of York.
The Earl of Suffolk.
Sir Richard Ketly.
Davy Gam Esquire.
And of all other men... but five-and-twenty score.
O God, thy arm was here.
- 'Tis wonderful.
- Come.
Go we in procession to the village.
Let there be sung
Non Nobis and Te Deum,
- the dead with charity enclosed in clay.
- # Non nobis dominum... #
And then to Calais!
And to England then, where ne'er from France arrived more happier men.
# Tuo da Gloriam
# Non nobis, Domine
# Sed nomine, tuo da Gloriam
# Te Deum laudamus
# Te Dominum confitemur
# Te aeternum Patrem
# Omnis terra veneratur #
Nay, that's right.
But why wear you your leek today?
Saint Davy's day is past.
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things, Captain Gower.
I will tell you, as my friend,
Captain Gower.
The rascally, beggarly, lousy knave, Pistol, which you and yourself and all the world know to be no better than a fellow, look you, of no merits - he is come to me and bring me bread and salt yesterday, look you, and bid me eat my leek.
It was in a place where I could not breed no contention with him, but I will be so bold as wear it in my cap till I see him once again.
And then I will tell him a little piece of my desires.
Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his returning to London under the form of a soldier.
And what such as the camp can do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought of.
Here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.
'Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his turkey-cocks.
God bless you, Pistol, you scurvy, lousy knave.
- God bless you.
- Hah! Art thou bedlam?
Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.
I beseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, to eat, look you, this leek.
Eugh. Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
There is one goat for you.
Will you be so good as eat it?
Base Trojan! Thou shalt die.
You say very true when God's will is.
I will desire you to live in the meantime, and eat your victuals.
Come, there is sauce for it.
If you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.
- Bite, I pray you.
- Must I bite?
Out of doubt and out of question, too.
By this leek,
I will most horribly revenge...
I eat. I eat...
- I swear...
- Nay, pray you, throw none away.
The skin is good for your broken coxcomb.
When you take occasions to see leeks hereafter,
I pray you mock at 'em, that is all.
- Good.
- Ay, leeks is good.
Hold you, here is a penny to heal your head.
- Me, a penny?
- Yes, verily.
In truth you shall take it or I have another leek in my pocket which you shall eat.
God b'wi' you and keep you and... heal your head.
Brrrrr!
All hell shall stir for this.
Go to. You are a counterfeit, cowardly knave.
You thought, because he could not speak English in the native garb, that he therefore could not handle an
English cudgel. But you find it otherwise.
And henceforth, let a Welsh correction teach you a good English condition.
Fare ye well.
Doth fortune play the strumpet with me now?
News have I that my Nell lies dead in the hospital, of the malady of France.
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
Old do I wax, and from my weary limbs honour is cudgelled.
Well... bawd I'll turn, and something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.
To England will I steal, and there... I'll steal, and patches will I get unto these scars, and swear I got them in these present wars.
Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met.
Unto our brother France and to our sister, health and fair time of day.
Joy and good wishes to our most fair and princely cousin, Katherine.
And as a branch or member of this royalty, we do salute you, Duke of Burgundy.
And princes French, and peers, health to you all.
Right joyous are we to behold your face, most worthy brother England, fairly met.
So are you, princes English, every one.
So happy be the issue, brother England, of this good day and of this gracious meeting, as we are now glad to behold your eyes - your eyes which hitherto have borne in them, against the French that met them in their bent, the fatal balls of murdering basilisks.
The venom of such looks we fairly hope have lost their quality, and that this day shall change all griefs and quarrels... into love.
To cry amen to that, thus we appear.
My duty to you both, on equal love, great Kings of France and England.
Since that my office hath so far prevailed that face to face and royal eye to eye you have assembled, let it not disgrace me if I demand, before this royal view, why that the naked, poor and mangled peace, dear nurse of arts, of plenties, and ofjoyful births, should not in this best garden of the world, our fertile France, put up her lovely visage.
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased, and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps, corrupting in its own fertility.
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart, unpruned, dies.
Her hedges even-pleached, put forth disordered twigs.
Her fallow leas, the darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory, doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts that should deracinate such savagery.
The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth the freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover, wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank, conceives by idleness, and nothing teems but hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs, losing both beauty and utility.
Even so our houses and ourselves and children have lost, or do not learn for want of time, the sciences that should become our country, but grow like savages - as soldiers will that nothing do but meditate on blood - to swearing and stern looks, diffused attire, and everything that seems... unnatural.
Which to reduce into her former favour you are assembled.
Then, Duke of Burgundy, you must gain that peace with full accord to all our just demands.
I have but with a cursory eye o'erglanced the articles.
Pleaseth your grace to appoint some of your council presently to sit with us.
We will suddenly pass our accept and peremptory answer.
Brother, we shall.
Will you, fair sister, go with the princes... or stay here with us?
Our gracious brother, I will go with them.
Haply, a woman's voice may do some good when articles too nicely urged be stood on.
Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us.
She hath good leave.
Fair Katherine, and most fair... will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady's ear and plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Your Majesty shall mock at me.
I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart,
I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue.
Do you... like me, Kate?
Pardonnez-moi?
I cannot tell what is... "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate.
And you are like an angel.
Que dit-il?
Que je suis semblable à les anges?
Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grâce, ainsi dit-il.
O bon Dieu. Les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.
What says she, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui, that the tongues of de mens is be full of deceits.
I' faith, Kate, I am glad thou can speak no better English.
For if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think that I had sold my farm to buy my crown.
I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say... "I love you. "
Give me your answer, i' faith do, and so clap hands and a bargain.
How say you, lady?
Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.
Marry, if you put me to verses, or to dance for your sake, Kate, why, you undo me.
If I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her favours,
I could lay on like a butcher, and sit like a jackanapes, never off.
But before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my eloquence, nor have I no cunning in protestation.
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, that never looks in his glass for the love of anything he sees there, whose face is not worth sunburning... take me.
If not, to say to thee that I shall die is true.
But, for thy love, by the Lord, no.
Yet I love thee, too.
And while thou livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain constancy, for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do always reason themselves out again.
A speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad.
A straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon.
If thou wouldst have such a one, take me.
And take me, take a soldier.
Take a soldier, take a king.
And what sayest thou then to my love?
Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.
Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of France?
No, Kate, but in loving me you would love the friend of France, for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it.
And Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours, then yours is France, and you are mine.
I... cannot tell what is dat.
No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a newly married wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook off.
Er... Je... quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi...
Er... donc vôtre est France et vous êtes mienne.
I shall never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at me.
Sauf votre honneur, le français que vous parlez, il est meilleur que I'anglais que je parle.
No, i' faith, it's not, Kate.
Thy speaking of my tongue and thy thine must needs be granted to be much alike.
But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English?
Canst thou... love me?
I cannot tell.
Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate?
I'll ask them.
Come, I know thou lovest me.
And at night, when you are come into your chamber, you will question this gentlewoman about me, and I know, Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me which you love with your heart.
But, good Kate, mock me mercifully - the rather, gentle princess, because I love thee... cruelly.
What sayest thou, my fair flower-de-luce?
La plus belle Katherine du monde, mon très chère et divine déesse.
Your majesté 'ave a false French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.
Now fie upon my false French but, by mine honour, in true English,
I love thee, Kate.
By which honour, though I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me thou dost.
Put off your maiden blushes.
Avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress.
Take me by the hand and say,
"Harry of England, I am thine" - which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud,
"England is thine, Ireland is thine,
France is thine
"and Henry Plantagenet is thine. "
Therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break thy mind to me in broken English - wilt thou have me?
Dat is as it shall please de roi mon père.
Nay, it shall please him well, Kate.
It shall please him, Kate.
Den it shall also content me.
Upon that I kiss your hand and call you my queen.
Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez!
Ma foi, je ne peut vous abbaissez votre grandeur en baisant la main d'une de votre indigne serviteur.
Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon treis-puissant seigneur.
Oh.
- Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
- Oh!
Les dames et demoiselles pour être baisées devant le noces, ce n'est pas la coutume en France.
Madam my interpreter, what says she?
That it is not the fashion for the ladies of France...
Oh...
- I cannot tell what is "baiser" in English.
- To kiss.
Votre majesté entend bettre que moi.
It is not the fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, would she say?
Oui, vraiment.
O Kate... nice customs courtesy to great kings.
Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion.
We are the makers of manners, Kate.
Therefore, patiently... and yielding...
You have witchcraft in your lips... Kate.
God save Your Majesty.
My royal cousin, teach you our princess... English?
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.
Shall Kate be my wife?
Take her, fair son, that the contending kingdoms of France and England, whose very shores look pale with envy of each other's happiness, may cease their hatred and never war advance his bleeding sword
'twixt England and fair France.
Amen.
Thus far with rough and all-unable pen our bending author hath pursued the story, in little room confining mighty men, mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
Small time, but in that small most greatly lived this star of England.
Fortune made his sword, and for his sake, in your fair minds let this acceptance take.

First you take a drum beat
And then you add a clarinet
You sweeten with a trombone
Then let the other cats get set
Season with a sprinkling of Gabriel's horn
And presto
A song is born
They're here! They're here.
They just drove up.
Who is here?
You know, whatchamacallit, the lawyer for the foundation.
And Miss Totten is with him.
I saw them getting out of the car.
And this place is looking like a flicker's nest.
We're in for our semiannual wigging,
I suppose.
You'd better put your coat on, Frisbee.
Yeah, and fix your tie, too.
Fix your tie.
Come here.
Let me fix your hair a little bit.
- It looks so untidy.
- Straighten him up. That's it.
What is all this nonsense?
This nonsense is Miss Totten.
And will you please smile at her?
Gentlemen, this is very undignified.
If you think you're being funny, I...
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Miss Totten.
- Good morning, Miss Totten.
- Won't you sit here, please?
- It's a very nice day, Miss Totten.
Would you like to speak,
Miss Totten, or shall I?
- No, you go ahead, Mr. Setter.
- I will be brief as possible.
Gentlemen, to date,
$283,000 have been expended on the writing of this history of music.
I hope you realize that
Miss Totten's father, the late Daniel S. Totten, left only a quarter of a million dollars for this project.
Every additional penny has to come from Miss Totten's pocket.
You've been at it for 10 years now.
- Nine.
- All right, nine.
I want your frank estimate of how much longer you will take.
- Well...
- Maybe three years.
- Maybe four.
- Yes.
It cannot be. It just cannot be.
Oh, my dear Miss Totten.
Surely, you don't want to discontinue your father's great gesture towards human enlightenment, do you?
Human enlightenment?
Nonsense, Professor.
My father was a disappointed musician.
He was never able to master a single instrument.
So he decided to manufacture pianos, and because his name was not included with Steinway and Meyer and Chickering, he decided to finance this project.
Exactly.
And you'll have to get it done with, quickly.
- Slap it together.
- What?
Excuse me, Mr. Setter. May I have a word?
Hello, Professor Frisbee.
Hello, Miss Totten.
You said slap it together.
- We're not the slapping together kind.
- He's right.
And this is not an ordinary encyclopedia of music.
What's different about this except that it's taking longer?
Don't interrupt, Mr. Setter.
In what way is this different,
Professor Frisbee?
Well, as far as I know, this is the first history of music, which, in addition to its written volumes, will have albums of recorded music.
Now, in my own field of folk music...
- I'm not interested.
- Don't interrupt, Mr. Setter.
Go on, Professor.
I'm appealing to you, Miss Totten, to your vision and to your heart.
Perhaps I'm maybe a little inarticulate, but I've somehow always regarded you as...
You know what I mean, Miss Totten?
Of course.
Well, it was my father's dying wish, and you do make such an eloquent plea.
- But all of this seems so useless.
- Exactly.
It's not only useless, dull, unromantic, but unprofitable.
My dear Mr. Setter, bringing the peoples of the world closer together through the universal language of music can hardly be termed useless, dull and unromantic.
Our work is anything but that.
- It is often very exciting.
Oh, fiddlesticks.
- Yes, even emotional.
- Really?
Yes, Miss Totten, we...
Only the other day we were recording a Polynesian chant, love chant.
- West Indian, wasn't it?
- Samoan, I believe.
Get to the point.
The point is, Mr. Setter, the chant was exciting and it was emotional.
It concerned itself with the relation of music to courtship.
Courtship?
My dear Frisbee, if you think that...
Just a minute, Mr. Setter.
I'm very interested, Professor.
Well, perhaps we can demonstrate it for Miss Totten.
Yes, let's demonstrate it.
I don't think that would be the logical thing to do.
- That's a very good idea.
- Please, please do.
I'd love to hear it.
Well, all right. Gentlemen, if you please.
- Yes, let's do it.
- All right.
Now, Miss Totten, imagine the setting in an island courtship.
There's a vacant hut.
The nuptial hut all bedecked with flowers.
And nearby, the maiden awaits the arrival of her lover.
Oh, excuse me.
Professor Oddly, you will be the maiden.
- But, Professor Frisbee, I...
- Oddly.
Must I, Professor Frisbee?
If you'll just stand over there,
Oddly, please!
Now, Miss Totten, as the lover approaches from the opposite side of the village, he is laden down with gifts.
And the beating of the drums signalizes the beginning of the courtship.
As he comes nearer the village, his relatives take up the drumming.
Then he spies the maiden and calls to her, and she answers.
Professor, would you give us the mating call please?
That's the mating call.
Now, imagine I'm coming around the corner of the hut.
He spies the maiden.
Just... Just one moment, gentlemen.
Oddly, that was quite adequate for the recording, but I feel the air of reality is somewhat strained here.
But, Professor Frisbee,
I didn't want to do it anyway.
I know that, Oddly, but I...
Professor, perhaps I could...
Very well, if you'll just stand here,
Miss Totten.
- And when I give you the mating call...
- Yes?
...you give it right back to me.
Now, imagine I'm coming around the corner of the same hut.
No.
Just... May I interrupt just one moment?
I'm afraid, Miss Totten, you'll have to employ a great deal more abandon both in voice and posture.
I neglected to tell you about the posture.
The native position being somewhat more like this.
And it has...
Yes, that's fine, Miss Totten.
Now imagine I'm coming around the corner of the hut.
That's fine, Miss Totten.
That's a considerable improvement.
Now, more abandon, Miss Totten. Yes.
Now, as the man hears the maiden, the beat of the drums intensifies.
Fever of the music has entered into his blood.
His nostrils are distended and his eyes are gleamed.
And the singing goes on like this.
I'm sorry, Miss Totten,
I'm merely assuming the role of the lover and you the role of the maiden.
This call is the lover's greeting, and it is accomplished by the diaphragmatic pressure so necessary to the primitive sound in this fashion.
Would you try that, Miss Totten, please?
That's very good, Miss Totten.
You seem to have caught the spirit quite well.
Now, would you try that once with me.
That's fine, Miss Totten.
Miss Totten.
I don't like to interrupt, Miss Totten, but...
Miss Totten, I don't like to interrupt, but you've caught the spirit extremely well, Miss Totten.
Now, from this point on, the dance just continues until the lover takes the maiden in his arms and carries her away, but I don't think there's any point in demonstrating that.
It was wonderful. Simply wonderful.
- Miss Totten, I thought you'd decided...
- I liked it. I liked it.
- Yes, Miss Totten?
- Professor, the work at the foundation must continue. I'll see to that.
- Miss Totten, you forgot your...
- Oh, thank you.
- ... bag.
- Goodbye, Professor.
- Goodbye.
- And thank you.
I enjoyed every second of it.
Miss Totten, you know that your previous intentions...
A most amazing performance, Frisbee.
We are very much indebted to you, Frisbee.
I don't know, gentlemen. I don't know.
- You don't understand...
- I don't know whether our behavior was in keeping with the seriousness of our work.
- Oh, well, I...
- However, I do feel our actions
- were justified in the...
- We beg your pardon, gentlemen.
Yes, sir, indeed.
- We hope you don't mind.
- We came through the window.
Who are you?
- We're the window washers.
- The window washers.
- ELFINl: What is it you want?
Well, you gentlemen are long hairs, aren't you?
I hadn't noticed.
- Our hair is not particularly long.
This place's got some connection with music, ain't it?
Well, some.
We've been washing on the other side for a couple of days and listening to you.
We figured maybe you could help us out.
- In what way?
- With this quiz program on the radio.
What is it?
It's a musical quiz.
It has questions and answers, and you got to play the tune.
Maybe we should have got a radio.
Well, just what is your trouble?
Well, I can play the answers, if I knew the answers.
But he can't play them if he don't know them.
- That's logical.
- Have you got the questions with you?
- Sure, he's got them.
- Yes, here it is, right here.
Question... First question is number one.
And it says,
"What eminent contra... Contra... "
"What eminent contrapuntalist literally gave his name to a musical work?"
- That is obvious.
- That would be my department.
- Johann Sebastian Bach.
- Please to meet you.
- How do you do?
- How are you, Mr. Bach?
How do you do, Mr. Bach?
I'm not Mr. Bach.
Mr. Bach was born in Eisenach in Germany, in the year 1750 and died in 1685.
Are you sure about that, mister?
Yes, I'm sure he died.
They buried him on account of that.
Well, the way you got it, he didn't even get born.
Well, maybe I'm wrong.
He was born in 1685 and died in 1750.
Mr. Bach wrote beautiful music.
Beautiful music.
- He makes good beer, too.
- That so? I didn't know that. Yeah.
The composition referred to is a fugue written by Mr. Bach with the letters of his name B flat,
A, C, and B natural.
B- A-C-B? Bach?
That doesn't sound right, does it?
I'm asking you.
The Germans, of course, use the letter H for our B natural, meaning B flat when they say B.
- Mister, I don't need all of that.
- He just needs to know the tune.
You mean just a few bars for recognition?
- That's it.
- I'd be very happy to play it for you.
- There you are.
- Is that all there is to it?
That's all there is, just the four notes.
Well, I'm going to lay some stuff with my left hand on the bass here.
When I give you the nod with my head, you give me them four notes up there.
Very good.
- Most unusual.
- It's amazing.
A very remarkable construction in the bass pattern.
- You think so?
- I'd like to hear more of it.
I can't do much with this Bach guy.
No, he's too square.
Maybe the next cat's got a little more beat.
- Who's got the next question?
- He's got them over there.
Frisbee, the second question please.
Oh, yes, right here.
"What bit of African terpsichore
"came from the pen of a Norwegian composer?"
- That would be you, Gerkikoff.
- That is easy.
That would be Anitra's Dance.
You know the melody, Magenbruch.
Yes, I know it.
Anitra's dance is from Grieg's incidental music for Ibsen's Peer Gynt.
Would you like to play it for us,
Magenbruch?
Lovely melody.
I heard that before.
Would you play it again for me, please?
It will be interesting to note what he accomplishes with this one.
- Yes, that's right.
- I think I got it now.
Play it once more for me.
Very good. Very good.
Well, it reminds me of the chaconne or passacaglia.
Except that the amazing variations on the melody depend so much on their peculiar passing tones
- and leading notes.
- I noticed a definite resemblance.
It is curious combination of harmonium...
It moves constantly on the tonic and subdominant.
Particularly noticed the double quadruple figuration.
- I didn't do all of that, did I?
- That's just plain boogie-woogie.
- Boogie-woogie. What's that?
- You never heard of that?
Never heard of boogie-woogie?
Well, you see, we've been shut in here for a long time.
- Too long.
- Has this boogie-woogie been going on for some time?
Man alive!
And are there any other forms of this new folk music besides that?
- Sure. There's swing, jive, jump...
- Blues, two-beat Dixie, rebop and...
What's that?
- Rebop.
- Amazing.
Did you hear that, Professor Frisbee?
ELFINl: And your book on folk music is almost finished.
Gentlemen, I'm an idiot. An absolute idiot.
And I'm terribly grateful to both of you for making me aware of it.
Do you realize that since we've been cooped up here, music has changed and changed considerably?
I've been completely unaware of this situation.
However, I intend to rectify it immediately.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know. I don't know.
I think perhaps the only solution is...
- Gentlemen, I am going out.
- Out?
- Where?
- Out. Out into the world.
Out of this house. Out to tap the major sources of this new music.
- Woogie-boogie?
- Two-beat Dixie?
- Jump?
- Jive?
- Swing?
- Blues?
Rebop.
- Exactly. And I should be leaving now.
- He's going out.
- I should like to go, too.
- Frisbee, could I go with you?
Why couldn't we all go?
- Yes, Frisbee, why couldn't we?
- No, really. Please, gentlemen.
As much as I would love to have you come along, it was my oversight, and you'd be losing a full day's work.
After all, this is my field.
Just where would you go, Frisbee?
I'm going out to the nightclubs, the dance halls.
- Yes, even the honky-tonks.
- Aren't you frightened?
- No, I... Well, goodbye, Elfini.
- Goodbye, Frisbee.
- Good luck.
- Goodbye, my boy.
Good luck to you.
Oh, would you mind leaving the key under the mat?
I may not be home until 9:00 this evening.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I'm worried about the whole thing.
Hiya, bud.
I beg your pardon, could you tell me what time the music starts?
You're pretty early, fella. This joint don't open for another couple of hours.
Another couple of... Thank you, thank you.
- How do you do, Mr...
- Mel Powell.
Mel Powell. How do you do? My name is...
- Frisbee.
- Frisbee.
And this card is self explanatory,
Mr. Powell.
We're conducting a round table research.
We'd like very much for you to attend...
Blind man stood on the way and cried!
The blind man stood on the way and cried!
Cried
Well, old blind Barnabas
Stood on the way
Blind Barnabas stood on the way
Well, old blind Barnabas
Stood on the way crying
Oh, Lordie have mercy on me
Well, in my God's bible in the book of James
Christ was a-healing the cripple and the lame
Giving the poor and the needy a break
Healing the sick and raising the dead
Well, they tell me when he passed through Galilee
He passed by a man that couldn't see
The man was blind and crippled from birth
Tell me that his name was blind Barnabas
When Barnabas heard that my lord was nigh
He fell on his knees and began to cry
Crying "Oh, thou man of Galilee
"Great God a mighty have mercy on me... "
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Daddy-O, I'm gonna teach you some blues
From now on
That's all you'll be able to use
Do you hear me, Daddy-O?
I'm gonna teach you some blues
However you wanted it
I sang your song
Whenever you wanted me
I tagged along
But that lipstick on your shirt isn't mine
So I'm getting off
It's the end of the line
Do you hear me, Daddy-O
I'm gonna teach you some blues
He told you that a woman was his religion
But I didn't hear him mention that he meant them all
So now while you're concerned
You're just a dead pigeon
Well, I've got to be the only filly in the stall
You've got a lot of fish a-waiting round to nibble
And your baby's got a line that they can't overload
So, Baby-O, you're hardly in the mood to quiver
You'll make me very happy if you hit the road
You gave me the runaround and that was wrong
You wanted to run around so run along
If we never meet again, it's too soon
And I'll make a bet you'll be changing your tune
Do you hear me, Daddy-O?
I'm gonna teach you some blues
However you wanted it
I sang your song
Whenever you wanted me
I tagged along
But that lipstick on your shirt isn't mine
So I'm getting off
It's the end of the line
Do you hear me, Daddy-O?
I'm gonna teach you some blues!
I'll teach you
I'll teach you
I'll teach you
I'm gonna teach you some blues
- Come on, quick.
- Quick is right.
What's the fever?
Listen, you got to take it on the lam.
- Yeah, they're looking for you.
- Wait a minute.
Who's looking for me?
- The district attorney.
- Why?
You've got to get dressed and get out of here before they slap a subpoena on you.
A subpoena?
Come on, we'll talk about it in the dressing room.
Why can't you tell me here?
Now what it all this subpoena business?
It's on account of Tony.
- What happened to him?
- Nothing.
- But something happened to Ernie Hart.
- Ernie Hart?
I told Tony not to monkey with him.
Well, he won't anymore.
The funeral's tomorrow.
But Tony didn't have nothing to do with it.
Did he, Monte?
Oh, no. Tony's as innocent as the new mown hay.
Who said Tony had anything to do with it?
But he was framed, Honey, honest he was.
The DA's trying to pin it on him, just because they found that ring near the body.
- What ring?
- That ring you gave Tony for his birthday.
Yeah. It was a little too big for him, remember?
Well, it slipped off and Tony lost it someplace.
That's why you gotta beat it.
And stay undercover.
What for? What's it got to do with me?
Well, right now they can't prove that ring was Tony's.
But when the DA finds out you bought it, and everybody knows about you and Tony.
Well, it'll look awful bad for him.
You're what they call a maternal witness.
Tony mixed up in a murder.
I don't believe it.
We've got to get you out of here before they slap a subpoena on you.
Who is it?
I'd like to have a few words with you in regard to an investigation I'm conducting.
- Just a minute.
- Let him in. We'll handle him.
- Yeah?
- How do you do, Miss Swanson?
Hello.
I hate to intrude like this, but this inquiry is really very important.
Get this, I don't know from nothing.
But I'm sure you do.
You could probably help me more than anyone.
All I would like is a little of your time.
Say an hour or so a day.
- Say, are you a cop or aren't you?
- A cop?
No, I'm not a cop.
- Well, then what are you selling?
- Selling?
- Nothing. I'm from the Totten Foundation.
- I don't wear any.
Oh, no, no, I'm Professor Frisbee of the Totten Musical Foundation.
Well, then what is this investigation, Professor?
Well, it concerns itself with modern jazz and other forms of popular music.
I'd like you to help me. Would you mind?
Yes, I would. Goodbye.
In case you change your mind, here's my card.
- Okay. Yeah.
- It's the address of the foundation.
- Good night.
- And also my address.
Goodbye.
- Honey Swanson.
- What do you want?
- Just put the coat on.
- All right.
We'll get out the window.
Right in there.
Open up. District attorney's office.
Where to?
- Just keep cruising, Jack.
- Where are we going?
- Well...
How about that warehouse on West 11th?
No, too many rats.
Hey, wait a minute, where are you taking me?
We can't take you to your place.
They'll have it covered.
- But you live some place, don't you?
- Yeah, sure, and the cops know where.
I thought of a hotel, but they'll fan every hotel in town.
I could change my name.
Listen, Honey, why take chances?
It's an awful nice warehouse.
He says rats.
Well, maybe a few little bitty mice, but...
- Uh-uh. That's out.
- Say, I got an uncle who's an undertaker, and with business the way it is, he's always bound to have an extra slab.
- That's fine, that's all I need.
- Oh, no. Keep thinking.
Hey, what's this?
Totten Foundation.
Hobart Frisbee. That's, that professor jerk.
He must have...
ELFINl: I never would have believed it.
It seems impossible.
Have I missed anything?
No, Oddly, I was just explaining, and I repeat, gentlemen,
I actually heard Rimsky-Korsakov played on a washboard...
- A washboard?
- ... a bicycle pump...
- Bicycle pump?
- ... a plunger of some sort and pots and pans.
- Heaven knows what else.
- You cannot make music out of pots and pans.
Are you sure you had nothing to drink but buttermilk?
- Quite sure.
- What else was there?
Please tell us.
I heard remarkable music, strange rhythms.
- I talked to people.
- What kind of people?
- All sorts of people. Musicians, singers.
- Chorus girls?
- All sorts of people.
- Prima donnas?
- And did you go backstage?
- Yes, yes, I had...
I had one conversation with a young girl in her dressing room.
- Dressing room!
- But unfortunately she wasn't interested in our project.
A blond or brunette?
I don't remember, Oddly, I didn't notice.
I once went backstage to see Pavlova.
Imagine ballerinas and all that.
- In tights, I suppose.
- Naturally in tights.
- And that ineffable smell of rice powder.
- On bare shoulders.
It's getting late, gentlemen, perhaps we should go to bed.
I'd like to have heard a lot more.
Me, too.
- Frisbee.
- Yes?
Frisbee, in your travels this evening, did you encounter any music where the melodic figure in straight eights is changed to one of Umpateedle character?
- What's that?
- Umpateedle.
What are you reading here, Magenbruch?
That's one of the books
I procured this afternoon.
Jazz.: Hot and Hybrid.
That's very interesting.
I should like to read it after you're through with it.
Yeah. I particularly like the chapter on hot rhythm.
Holds strange fascination for me.
I can understand that, but I wouldn't allow myself to neglect the Palestrina research.
Hold on.
- Why, that's our doorbell.
- At 3:00 in the morning?
That will be the revisions on Stravinsky's new ballet.
I asked them to be sent by air mail special.
I'll get it.
- Hiya, Professor.
- Oh, hi!
Am I late for school?
Oh, my goodness!
Well, are those kids in my class?
Oh, no, those are just my colleagues.
I must apologize for their lack of attire.
That's all right, Professor.
And for the fact that I don't have any coat on.
You know, once I watched my big brother shave.
You did?
Frankly, your coming here was the last thing I expected.
Your "no" was so definite.
Well, I got thinking it over.
Music has done a lot for me.
And well, here was a chance to do something for music.
Well, then I take it you've reconsidered?
Yep. You've talked me into it, Professor.
Oh, my goodness!
- What was that?
- That was Professor Oddly.
- Any more of them around?
- I hope not.
Boy, this place sure is loaded with antiques, present company excepted.
Thank you. Thank you.
- May I have your coat?
- Yeah. Thanks.
Mozart.
Say, I've got a copy like this with a radio inside.
Are you sure you don't want your coat?
No, I'm fine.
Except I've got a run in this stocking.
Well, when do we start, Professor?
What's your method?
It's quite simple, really. If you'll be here no later than 9:30 tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow morning?
- Yes.
Yes, we've arranged a round table discussion with a group of people of various musical backgrounds.
You don't think we could sort of begin right now?
Begin... Well, Miss Honey, it's past 3:00.
Oh, foo, Professor, let's get ourselves a couple of drinks.
You light the fire maybe, and you could start working on me right away.
I wouldn't dream of imposing at this hour.
Listen, I figured on working all night.
Oh, you did...
Well, any random discussion would...
Yes?
...prove of no scientific value whatsoever.
You see, I must have my notes thoroughly prepared for tomorrow morning's seminar.
Okay, where do I sleep?
- I beg your pardon.
- Where do I sleep?
I don't know. Where do you usually sleep?
I'm usually in Brooklyn, but tonight I'm going to sleep here.
- Right. Here?
Why not?
Well, I mean, we're all bachelors here,
Miss Honey, except maybe Professor Oddly...
- Professor.
- He was a widower.
But there's a... Sleep here?
Oh, no. See, no woman has ever...
Even Miss Bragg, our housekeeper, goes home every night at 7:30.
Listen, if you want me here tomorrow morning at 9:30...
Yes, I do, Miss Honey. I definitely do.
But even the most free thinking people would have to respect...
Now wait a minute.
Feel that.
Go on, feel that foot.
- Now, what have you got to say?
- It's cold.
It's cold and it's wet.
Now, come here.
Come here.
Closer.
- Hiya, kids.
- How do you do?
Now, look down my throat.
Oh, come on. Now, what do you see, huh?
I don't know what to look for.
Well, there is a slight rosiness in the laryngeal region.
There. You see? He knows. Who are you?
- Who is he?
- This is Professor Twingle.
And Professor Gerkikoff, Dr. Elfini...
Wait a minute, not so fast.
I'll get to know them.
Come here, Twinkie.
I think I got a fever. Feel.
- Oh, yes. She definitely has. Oh, yes.
- Certainly.
And he wants to put me out.
- Oh, no.
- Frisbee, that is unkind.
You know it's been raining and the streets are still wet.
- Of course.
- No 9:30 for me if he puts me out in that.
- Naturally not.
- But you don't understand...
And the street's cold and the subway's hot and full of germs.
And I'm a pushover for streptococcus.
- Could I have this, kid?
- Excuse me.
Really, I don't understand you, Frisbee.
Why take chances?
- Yeah. With such valuable material.
- Think of your work, Professor Frisbee.
I am thinking of my work.
- You see, they get the point.
- I get the point, too.
What I'm trying desperately to explain...
- Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion?
- Yes?
Why not let the young lady sleep in my room?
- What?
- Well!
I often bunk with Dr. Elfini during an electrical storm.
- He's afraid of thunder.
Yes.
Well, then it's all settled.
I guess I'll turn in.
- Could I have my coat?
- Yes, yes.
Couldn't you possibly reconsider?
- This way, please.
- I'll show you to my room.
Yes, we all will.
Oh, no. I know where my own room is, without any help from anyone.
Well now, why couldn't we all go?
Gentlemen. Please, don't bother. I'll find it.
Just rough out the directions.
Top of the stairs.
The first door to the right.
- Could I have my coat?
- Oh, please.
Thank you. Hi Di Ho.
Hi Di Ho.
Just one moment, please.
Gentlemen, this is all highly irregular.
Suppose this came to the attention of the foundation, and what about Miss Bragg in the morning?
What are you talking about?
This is research, isn't it?
- Is it?
- Sure and I'm the guinea pig.
- Yes, a specimen under the microscope.
- Wonderful thing to research.
It is the searchlight of truth.
Without research, people would still think the earth was flat.
- That's ridiculous.
- And they would still look upon the tomato as a poisonous fruit.
There, you see.
And I want you to look at me,
Professor Frisbee, as another tomato.
- What?
Just another tomato.
That'll be sufficient for the balance, gentlemen.
- Shall we record it now?
Sure, by all means.
Yes, even Beethoven seems nice and gay this morning.
You're quite right.
- Gentlemen, before you start,
I should like to talk to you.
May I ask what all your trousers are doing in my kitchen?
Well, I wanted mine pressed.
- That accounts for one pair.
- So did I.
And I.
All six pairs at once.
What's going on in this house, anyway?
No constitutional this morning.
You scarcely touched your breakfast.
And, Professor Frisbee, this suitcase just came for you.
- For me?
- The man who left it, a strange looking character, said you'd understand.
- He left a message...
- Understand. I don't understand at all.
Well, why don't you open it up, Frisbee?
You say he left a message?
Well!
What were you saying about the message, Miss Bragg?
- I am waiting for you to explain.
- Explain what?
- That.
- That's...
- He has taken on an assistant.
- Very charming.
- Hi, kids.
Good morning.
Say, where can I get a cup of coffee?
Hi. Who are you?
Miss Honey, may I present Miss Bragg, our housekeeper.
Hi. This must be your apron I'm wearing.
This suitcase came for you with a message.
- Yeah? What message?
- I don't know.
The message was it's getting hotter and hotter and stay in the icebox like a good little salad.
- Salad?
- What could that mean?
What time is your clambake, Professor?
My clambake is at...
We start at 9:30 in the morning, and please try not to be late.
Give me a little help with the suitcase, and I won't be.
- Glad to.
- See you later, kids.
Well!
Excuse me.
Please continue without me for a while, gentlemen.
Now, to get back to the subject under discussion.
If we can classify the various forms of jazz along with a series of cross references and make a record of the history of this type of music,
I believe the work will be invaluable to the foundation.
- Now, don't you agree, gentlemen?
Yes, sure.
That's good.
And now that we're all agreed, in the vernacular I heard last night, let's start on the down beat and take off.
He's got it already.
- Is that the correct way of phrasing it?
- That's a good deal.
Yes. Well, I believe in order to start...
Gentlemen, we have accomplished a lot in the last three days, and we have many valuable records.
Now, before we start on the history of jazz, someone mentioned yesterday a small combo doing jump with a head arrangement.
I believe it was mister...
- Tommy Dorsey.
- Jimmy's brother.
Yes. I'm sorry. You spoke of...
It wasn't me, Professor.
That's not my type.
It could have been Mel Powell or Hamp.
Yeah, they're experts at that jive.
Well, then perhaps you gentlemen could help me.
Sure. Mel and I used to play a lot of that stuff with Benny Goodman.
Is that so?
Well, could you play an example of the type of music?
We'd be glad to.
But Joe, our clarinetist, couldn't come.
- That's too bad.
- Can anyone here blow a clarinet?
That's quite simple. Our Professor
Magenbruch plays the clarinet.
- Well, does he, Professor? I hardly think...
- He's apt to be a little too square.
He's quite proficient. I assure you.
If you'll just get ready,
I'll go and fetch him.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
I don't wish to interrupt, but we seem to need a clarinet to illustrate a new form of music.
- Why, certainly, here you go.
- Thank you very much.
No, Magenbruch, we need you with it.
You mean to play jazz?
Yes, it's very likely you might be able to play your Umpateedle.
Then, I better take my book along with me.
- Yes.
- Good, then we'll all go along.
- Yeah, sure.
- I think not, gentlemen.
Perhaps you'd better continue with your work.
I wish we could go, too.
This is our Professor Magenbruch, gentlemen.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I see you have everything ready.
- Is this the music here?
Oh, no. We don't use any music.
We haven't got anything written down,
Professor.
Well, we can't play without music.
- Well, Benny Goodman used to.
- Benny Goodman? I never...
- Frisbee, did you ever hear of him?
- No, no, I haven't.
Perhaps there is something in this book that might help you, Magenbruch.
- Yes. Yes.
- Just sit down, Professor, and if you feel like it, you can join in.
- Thank you.
- Mel, let's steal some apples.
That's fine, Professor.
Now anything we do, just follow us.
Young lady, young lady, come here.
Come with me, please.
Young lady, there are a couple of gentlemen, I use the word loosely, who would like to see you.
They're in the garden right through that door.
Thanks, cookie.
Well, it's about time.
I thought you two had amnesia and forgot where you parked me.
- We had trouble getting here.
- The DA has got 100 men looking for you.
- You're hotter than a firecracker.
- Squeezing this town through a sieve.
Well, okay. You wait here.
I'll get my things.
- Now, wait a minute.
- You're not leaving. Not now.
- Where's Tony?
- Well, he's on his way to Jersey.
- He'll call you from there.
- That's part of the big surprise.
- I don't like surprises.
- You'll like this one.
- Flash it on her. Go on.
- Put on your sunglasses.
- Oh, boy.
- Seven grand boiled into that one.
Well, Tony doesn't have to bribe me just because I do him a little favor.
I'd like to see him try and get it back.
- Hey, it's a little big.
- Third finger, left hand.
Say, who do you think you're kidding?
- The future Mrs. Tony Crow.
- What?
Tony's finally decided to use that license you took out last June.
Well, it's about time.
It was his mouthpiece's idea.
A wife can't testify against her husband, see?
Don't put it that way, you dope.
Say, he's been crazy about you since you met.
Yeah, but it took the DA to make him pop the question.
He's really got a big crush on you.
Sure. Only the other day he said to me,
"I get a bigger bang out of that Honey than any dame I ever knew. "
- Yeah?
- You don't know how lucky you are.
Oh, don't I though? Mrs. Tony Crow.
Diamonds, and ermine and a house in Westchester.
The wedding's gotta be a fast one.
Now, lay low and stick close by the phone.
- We'll call you tomorrow morning.
- Yeah. The bride will be waiting.
Hey, here's a paper that's got the whole story.
Read it in your room, Mrs. Crow.
Oh, fine!
Gentlemen, if I may have just one moment.
Gentlemen, if you please.
I think we are just about ready to record.
"The Totten Musical Encyclopedia, recording number 684J,
"illustrating chapters 22 to 29 in Volume 11, The History of Jazz.
"From Africa came the first musical instrument, a drum.
"The hollow trunk of a tree or a taut animal hide
"supplied the rhythm or beat.
"To the basic rhythm was added the human voice.
"Next, the first wind instrument, the shepherd's flute.
"The basic beat of the tom-tom and the same thematic strain
"of the chant that was carried across oceans
"and contained in early Spanish music after the invention of the guitar.
"It spread to countries which share the Spanish language.
"Cuba, West Indies, and South America
"where the rhythm or beat assumed a new form of expression.
"The ever-widening cycle finally reached the shores of the southern United States
"where the beat was momentarily lost,
"but the melody was woven into pure Negro spiritual. "
- Mockingbird
- Mockingbird
- Sang at morn
- Sang at morn
- And a song was born
- And a song was born
- Mockingbird
- Mockingbird
- Sang at morn
- Sang at morn
- And a song was born
- And a song was born
Then, the beat returned.
Well, the mockingbird
- Mockingbird
- Mockingbird
Oh, mockingbird
- Well, Lord looked down
- Well, Lord looked down
- And he gave the word
- And he gave the word
- And the angels put a song
- And the angels put a song
- In the mockingbird
- In the mockingbird
- When man was born
- When man was born
- He liked what he heard
- He liked what he heard
- And sang to the Lord
- And sang to the Lord
- With the mockingbird
- With the mockingbird
Singing, Lord, hear me
Well, he sang to the Lord
With the mockingbird
Praise be
- And the good Lord
- And the good Lord
- Liked everything he heard
- Liked everything he heard
They took the tune and the words
Right from the mockingbirds
That's how a song was born
And then a soft evening breeze
Hummed through the willow trees
That's how a song was born
The tinkling rain from the sky became a lullaby
And the blues must have come from a sigh
And when two hearts beat in time
Bluebells began to chime
That's how a song was born
They took a beat and made it reet
They took a beat and brought it down to Basin Street
Now we got it jumpin'
Satchmo, get on that horn
Let's hear, let's hear
Let's hear how jazz was born
One, two, three, four.
They took a reet jungle beat
Brought it to Basin Street
And that's how jazz was born
And then someone played a waiI
All up and down the scale
And that's how jazz was born
They simply played what they liked
As long as it would fit
If it just had a beat
That was it
And when a horn gave a scream
They took it as a theme
And that's how jazz was born
Blow it, Professor.
- Hiya, kids.
- The expert is here.
We need you.
- Yes, very much.
- What's the trouble?
We've been listening to the music from across the hall.
- It's very nice.
- They've been having jam sessions.
- A jam session.
- It sounds like a lot of fun.
- We'd like to try it.
- Why don't you?
We don't know how to begin.
They don't seem to have any kind of set form.
Well, you're right there.
That's exactly what a jam session is.
The first thing you want to do is let a little light in here.
Okay, kids, now all kind of gather around, and we'll get into it.
A jam session is taking a little tune you all know and doing things with it.
- Doing things?
- Sort of kicking it around like...
Well, what music do you know?
- You mean jump?
- Jive?
- Swing?
- ELFINl: Blues?
Rebop.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Miss Honey, these are two good friends of ours.
- We're the window washers.
- We're the window washers.
- He's Buck.
- And that's Bubbles.
- Hi.
- We're about to have a little jam session.
Would you care to join us?
- We sure would.
- We sure would.
Okay. Let's get back.
Now, where were we?
- We were talking about jump.
- Jive.
- Swing.
- Well, then you kids know all that.
No, we don't know any of that kind of music.
- They taught us those words.
- Well, that makes it kind of tough.
Now, what do you know?
- Well, we know Beethoven.
- Bizet.
- Wagner.
- Brahms.
Don't you know anything lighter than that?
- Symphonies.
- Concertos.
- Operas.
- Operas?
- Oh, yes.
- We know all of them.
Well, this will be a new kind of jam session, a long-haired one.
- Can you sing?
- No. No.
I'm afraid we don't know the words to the operas.
- We're more interested in music.
- Any words will do.
You got a newspaper, or a time-table or something?
Sure, he's got something.
- How will this be?
- What have you got there, Bubbles?
This is fine.
But we've gotta do a little rehearsing.
Now, this is what I want you to do.
You're to sing the words from the piece I give you.
- Here is yours.
- Thank you.
Here is yours.
Just sing whatever you read.
Totten Musical Encyclopedia, long-haired jam session.
- All ready, kids?
- Yes, yes, indeed.
Okay, let's go. Now watch it.

I think I like Sad Sack
It says he worked a mile in 1.:57 flat
Too bad he scratched
Oh, why did poor old Sad Sack have to go
- Why did poor old Sad Sack
- Why did poor old Sad Sack
- Have to go get scratched
- Have to go get scratched
They're off!

Thank you all very much, gentlemen, same time tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay, Professor.
- Nice going, Magenbruch.
- Thanks.
That was swell, Mag.
Okay, Fris.
Just listen to that.
Professor Frisbee, either that woman leaves this house, or I do.
- Are you speaking of Miss Honey?
- I am.
Ever since that woman crossed this threshold, a prairie fire of orgiastic events has swept through this house.
- Frisbee! Are you hurt?
- No, it merely startled me.
- It must have fallen from that shelf.
- Yes.
- I'll put it back.
- It was probably sympathetic vibration that caused it to fall.
Resonance can be a very powerful thing.
- It has been proved.
- That's true.
Seven trumpets tumbled down the walls of Jericho.
Caruso shattered a wineglass by merely singing at it.
- True.
- That's all very interesting gentlemen, but our whole project seems to be suffering from some sort of vibration.
- What do you mean?
- I'd like to talk to Miss Honey alone.
- But we were...
- If you don't mind.
Now, Miss Honey.
Would you take this chair, please?
- That particular chair?
- Yes, if you don't mind.
Okay.
Would you open your mouth?
A little wider.
- Thank you.
- Can I close it now?
Oh, please do.
- Miss Honey.
- Yeah.
Circumstances under which, that is, over which none of us has the least control force me to a step
I am most reluctant to take.
The sky is perfectly clear, the thermometer is at 76, your throat appears quite normal.
I'm afraid I must ask you to leave.
Leave here? Why?
I want you to look at this project, this history of music, as a voyage, a long, hard tedious voyage.
And when the Foundation first launched its vessel, it wisely followed an old rule of the sea.
No women aboard.
Consequently they chose a crew of single men with nothing to distract them from the course they were about to sail.
Say, Junior, you couldn't stop walking up and down here?
For the last four days, Miss Honey, we have been doing nothing but just drifting.
The needle of the compass no longer points to the magnetic pole.
It points, if I may say so, to your ankles.
Come now, admiral, a bunch of grown men.
- They've all seen a pair of ankles before.
- Not in nine years, they haven't.
Except for the singularly uninspired underpinnings of Miss Bragg.
Well, if you think I'm bothering them,
I'll sit on my legs, and I'll do it in my room or in the kitchen.
It's too late. You must leave now.
But I can't leave now.
What about your work?
It isn't even finished.
There are a lot of things we haven't even touched on.
Make no mistake, Miss Honey,
I shall regret deeply the absence of your keen mind.
But, unfortunately, it's inseparable from an extremely disturbing body.
All right, I'll go.
Only don't shove.
I'll leave some time tomorrow.
No, not tomorrow. Right away.
- But I tell you I...
- I insist.
- Old crabapple Annie. Listen...
- Crabapple Annie!
Why that implies that I'm puritanical and narrow-minded.
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm not.
I'm a perfectly normal man with perfectly normal instincts.
- An awful high boiling point.
- Not even that.
I, too, have been acutely aware of your presence.
You have?
But fortunately, I'm strong enough to be able to resist its demoralizing effects.
Oh, really?
I admit at times it was quite a struggle, but...
- Like when?
- Well, twice to be exact.
The first time when you leaned over my shoulder to explain the meaning of the word riff.
- And the second time?
- I'm not finished with the first time.
You leaned over my shoulder, and I felt your breath on my ear.
- And...
- And the second time, you were standing up against the window with the sunlight in your hair.
- But you didn't do anything about it.
- Yes, I did. I left the room.
I went upstairs, dipped my handkerchief into cold water and put it on the back of my neck.
Right here, where the nerve center is.
You're cute.
Just a little sunlight in my hair and you had to water your neck.
Well, perhaps
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
But I'm trying to explain that the whole success of the project depends on this.
I want you to cooperate.
I'd like you to leave.
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes, I do. I do.
Well, as long as I'm leaving anyway,
I may as well spill it.
Spill it? Spill what?
Why do you think I came here in the first place?
- Well, I imagine to help me in my research.
- No, I came on account of you.
- On account of me?
- Yeah.
Of all the men I've ever met,
I had to fall for a strong, silent man of distinction.
- Distinction...
- A man of unbending willpower, a man who can just flip me away like an old cigarette butt.
- Now, don't let it upset you, Miss Honey.
- But it does upset me.
Unfortunately, I don't happen to be strong.
I can't steel myself against you.
- Against me?
- Yeah, you.
Maybe it sounds crazy, but to me, you're a regular yumyum type.
- A yumyum?
- Yeah, you know what that means?
No, we haven't gotten to that yet.
We've got to it now, and I'm glad it's out.
I don't give a whoop if the others went for me.
It's you I'm wacky about. Just plain wacky.
Can you understand that?
- Please, Miss Honey...
- Please nothing.
Maybe you can generate or whatever it is for all that suppress business, but I can't.
Come here. You're so tall.
- What are you doing?
- You'll find out.
That's an extremely valuable reference book.
That's just too bad.
- Just perfect.
- What are you gonna do?
I'm going to show you what yumyum is.
Here's yum.
And here's the other yum.
And here's yumyum.
- Pardon me.
- Hey, where are you going?
Did you see?
He almost stepped on my hand.
- Three steps at a time.
- Like a shot out of a gun.
- Why?
- I don't know.
To get a razor strap I hope, and I hope he knows where to apply it.
- Well, Professor Frisbee?
- Yes, Miss Bragg.
Would someone call a taxicab for Miss Honey, please?
Of course, right away.
- Fine business.
- I beg your pardon?
What's the big idea of running out on me like that?
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
I've been thinking, Miss Honey, and...
Well, the last few minutes have confirmed my former decision.
Your further presence here would be fatal.
You must get me out of your mind just as I must get you out of this house.
Your hair's wet.
- Well, never mind, please.
- Well, it is wet.
Well, what of it?
Nothing. I just happened to notice it.
- Well, forget it, please.
- Okay, okay, but it is wet.
Now, to get back to the subject under discussion.
It would be idle for me to deny that I too feel very strongly this affinity that you spoke about a few minutes ago.
But after three years when my work is finished, perhaps we can take up where we left off.
In the meantime,
I hope that we may continue with some sort of correspondence.
- Would you, Miss Honey?
- Oh, Frizzy.
I know.
That's the way I feel, too, but it has to be.
Just one more thing before you go,
Miss Honey.
It will probably be a long time and I thought perhaps... Well, that is... I...
Would you yum me just once more?
- It seems so unnecessary.
- Yes, it does.
I think it's very...
- Taxi is here.
- I'll tell him.
Professor Frisbee, the taxi for that young woman is here.
Professor Frisbee, the taxi. The taxi!
- Yes, what is it?
- The taxi is here.
Taxi? What taxi?
Miss Swanson's or mine?
It's all yours, crabapple Annie!
- Get some coffee.
- Yes.
Now, you just sit down, and we'll get you something to eat.
- Miss Bragg kept something warm.
- Just sit down.
- Here's your coffee, Frisbee.
- Where have you been, Frisbee?
- Yeah, it's almost 4:00 in the morning.
- What happened to you?
- Come on, drink your coffee, Frisbee.
- Yes, here's the sugar.
Sugar, Frisbee.
No, no, that's salt.
Get another cup of coffee.
Now, Frisbee, you left before dinner.
Where have you been?
- Not on the cake.
- That's mustard.
Here's some more coffee.
ELFINl: Now, Frisbee, won't you please tell us where you've been?
Wait a minute.
No.
ELFINl: Oh, no.
No, no, no. Frisbee. Frisbee.
Have some toast.
Please, tell us. What's the matter?
Please, Frisbee. Frisbee?
What is the matter?
What's the matter?
I'm in love! That's what's the matter.
I'm in love.
I'm going upstairs to propose to her right now.
ELFINl: Frisbee?
Thank you, gentlemen, for the food.
It was delicious.
- Frisbee.
- Well, good night.
Frisbee! Frisbee!
- Package for Frisbee.
- That's me. Thank you very much.
- Sign here.
- What was the delay, young man?
Just sign there.
- I trust the engraving is all right.
- I guess so.
Thank you. Just a moment. Here you are.
- Thanks.
- You're quite welcome.
ELFINl: Are you sure it's a real diamond,
Frisbee?
I'm certain that it is.
The ring cost me $83.95, which didn't include the two dollars for the engraving.
- Let's see it, Frisbee.
- I'm trying to open it.
- Here, you...
- Yes, I...
There it is.
- Lovely. Lovely.
- It isn't very big, is it?
- But it is in extremely good taste.
- Lovely. Lovely.
Frisbee, as a man of experience,
- I assure you that I like it.
- Thank you very much.
Here's the breakfast you ordered,
Professor Frisbee.
Thank you, Miss Bragg.
Room service. Now it's room service.
Elfini, would you please put the ring under the toast cover?
- Why, certainly.
- Thank you.
- Well, goodbye.
- Good luck.
- Don't take no for an answer, Frisbee.
Be careful.
If I were the cream for that woman's coffee, I'd curdle.
Miss Bragg, I thought you were leaving us.
A nurse doesn't desert her post when an epidemic reaches its crisis.
Come in.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Frizzy.
I brought your breakfast.
Good. I'll have it right here. Thank you.
- How do you take it?
- Just jav, no cow.
- Just what?
- Black.
- Sugar?
- Straight.
- Toast?
- No, thanks.
You sure you don't want some toast?
- No toast, huh?
- Never use it.
Not even a small bite?
- Sit down. Take a load off your feet.
- Toast.
That's a book I was reading last night.
I couldn't sleep last night, either.
I just kept walking and walking until the sun came up over the East Sixties.
I had to have time to gather my thoughts together and kind of clarify our relationship.
You ever get one of those?
Yes, Miss Honey.
It's very important to me, too.
You see, it's new and rather strange.
Up until now, my life has been like, well, like an un-orchestrated theme.
Say, you couldn't talk a little plainer, could you?
Not unless you have a piece of toast or at least look under the lid anyway.
You went and bought me a present.
I hope it fits.
I went all over town last night trying to find a jewelry store that was open.
Now, isn't that sweet?
It's a lovely ring, really it is, Frizzy.
I had hoped you'd like it.
It's our engagement ring.
Frizzy, do you mean that...
Yes, I do.
- Do you mean you really thought...
- Well, I... Yes.
What am I supposed to say?
Why, just say yes.
After what you told me yesterday the way you feel about me, all you have to do now is say yes.
Frizzy, don't you think you're being a bit hasty?
I'm just as surprised as you are.
Marriage. I always thought
I was married to my music.
I thought the only thing could stir me was Piatigorsky on the cello,
Heifetz on the violin,
Toscanini conducting a symphony.
And then... Then you.
You see, I've had rather a curious background.
I was graduated from Princeton when I was 13.
When I was a year old,
I could sing Three Blind Mice, and before I was three,
I knew that the major chord on flattened supertonic was D flat, F and A flat, in the key of C, of course.
People like that... I don't know.
Dust just piles up on their hearts.
It kind of took you to blow it away.
Yeah, but I didn't mean to blow it smack into your eyes.
That's what happened.
Why don't you look inside the ring?
There's some writing. Musical notes.
Yes. There wasn't enough room for all the words, so I used notes instead.
Notes from the opening phrase of an aria from the opera Paris and Helen.
Quote, "O thou beloved,
"whom so long my heart desireth,
"when will the day ere be that my heart thou doth bless
"with a softly whispered yes. "
Unquote I suppose.
I hope you don't think it's too corny.
Oh, Frizzy, I...
Yes, come in.
Miss Honey, there is a telephone call for you.
- For me?
- Yes.
We hate to interrupt you, but it is a long distance call.
The man on the wire said it was from your daddy.
- Daddy?
- That's what he said.
My daddy. Oh, yeah. I'll take it right away.
- How did it go, Frisbee?
- Very well.
- She seemed quite overwhelmed.
- That was to be expected, though.
Excuse me, but the customary procedure is to approach
- the parents of the young lady first.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hello.
- Hello, Honey, this is Monte.
The boss wants to talk to you.
Only we're relaying the call so it won't be traced. Get me?
Here she is, boss, ready?
Okay, now, Honey, don't use no names, though.
Oh, boy, did you call at the right minute.
Where are you?
A little one horse town in New Jersey.
Rancocas it's called.
How have you been, baby?
Everything under control?
Not anymore.
Things are getting complicated.
No, no, nothing like that.
It's just that one of the kiddies has broken out in a rash.
Yeah, a slight case of spring fever.
Well, don't let the old boy run you down in his wheelchair.
Everything is set, baby.
I've got a Justice of the Peace all lined up.
That's what we're trying to figure out.
How to get you down here.
No, don't want you to take a train.
They'd spot you like a lead dime.
They'll be watching everything,
Holland Tunnel,
George Washington Bridge, everything.
I don't care if I have to hitchhike out of here in a hearse.
I've got to get out of here.
I don't like it. I want...
Well, what other news is there, Daddy?
Everything fine at home?
How's mom's lumbago?
- How's whose what?
- Home for her birthday?
Well, I don't know, Daddy.
I won't be long.
Just wait in the library, please.
If you don't mind, I'd like to have a few words with your father.
Oh, sure.
Daddy, this is the professor
I was telling you about.
Hello, Mr. Swanson.
This is Hobart Frisbee.
I gather your daughter has told you of our intentions.
Hey, what is all this double talk?
Before asking for her hand,
I realize I should have asked your permission.
Please, Frizzy.
- Are you crazy?
- You're so right, Mr. Swanson.
I realize this must come as a great shock to you.
One of these old dodos has got a yen for Honey.
Well, speak up, son.
What have you got for to offer?
Well, as character references, you may call the head of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and the president of Princeton, that's my university.
Except for occasional trouble with my left sinus,
I am in excellent physical condition.
How's your digestion, son?
Excellent, sir. Excellent.
I draw a salary of $3,200 per year and board.
It's not very large, but we'll watch our nickels and...
Do I what?
Gamble? Oh, no, sir, I...
That's fine. That's fine.
Adams, I think I've got a brain flash.
Son, what did you say your first name was? Hobart?
Well, all right, Hobart.
I don't know whether Honey told you this or not, but she's our only child.
Well, we hadn't figured on having a professor in the family, but if that's what she wants, it's okay by us.
Well, I shall do everything in my power to make her very happy.
One other thing, Hobart.
You see, we're not young anymore.
Her mother is an invalid, and it would just about break her heart not to see her Honey married.
You understand?
Of course, Mr. Swanson.
My own mother is dead, but I realize what it would have meant to her to be present.
Well, suppose you bring the kid right down here.
We want to meet you, and we'll have the ceremony right here in our own hometown.
Of course.
May I call you Father?
Thank you, Father.
This is more than I hoped for.
Father wants to talk to you.
Yes?
Well, that takes care of the transportation, baby.
Who's going to question the Curtis
Institute and Princeton University?
Oh, listen, to...
Daddy, maybe there's some other way.
I don't want to take him for that kind of a ride.
It's quite all right. I'll take a few days off.
- Yeah, we all will.
- Excellent idea.
- Anyway, they don't have a car.
- We'll rent one. I can drive, I think.
Never mind the alibis, baby.
This gets you to Rancocas.
I don't want any arguments, understand?
Hello.
- What's the matter, my dear?
- He's always in such a rush.
Father? Well, that's my good fortune.
The sooner the better.
Gentlemen, I have the honor to announce our engagement.
Oh, good. Congratulations.
There, now, Miss Bragg, don't cry.
I hope you're doing the right thing, Professor.
I know I am.
Why don't you go upstairs and pack some things for my fiancee?
- All right.
- Thank you.
I want to be an usher.
I want to be an usher.
- We'll all be ushers.
- Yes.
One kisses the bride.
- Yeah, we'll all kiss the bride.
That's right.
May we, Frisbee?
Go right ahead, gentlemen.
Thank you.
You've made us very happy. Very happy.
We feel that you are marrying all of us a little.
Yes, we all do.
We wish you all the happiness in the world, my dear.
Yes, yes. Yes, indeed.
Well, if we're going to get started this afternoon,
I'd better get my things together.
Kind of a cheesy picture of me, isn't it?
Now I know you better,
I'd say it's a little flattering.
- Check.
- Out of consideration for Professor Frisbee, I'll let you get your things together
- and get down the back stairs.
- And then you'll call the police?
No, that would be too humiliating for Professor Frisbee.
Just get out and disappear.
I've already made other arrangements.
Don't worry.
I'm not marrying any professor.
- You're certainly not.
- The guy I'm getting is going to keep me in diamonds and mink coats, not bungalow aprons.
That's pretty good for a gal who came up the hard way, huh?
- We'll have this room fumigated.
- You can do that after we're gone.
- You're not taking Professor Frisbee.
- I'm taking all of them.
- Oh, you are?
- Oh, no.
Let me pass.
You're forcing me to phone the police.
Look, cookie. Any spilling that's to be done, I'll do, but not yet.
Not while it'll bug up everything.
If you think I'm letting you take my professors...
Look at it this way, cookie.
The harm's been done.
Frizzy's going to wear his heart in a sling whether he finds out sooner or later.
Here or in Jersey doesn't make any difference to him.
Only in Jersey is a darned sight better for me.
- Better for you indeed.
- Oh, no.
- Let me through that door.
- No.
Let me through that door, or I'll scream.
Oh, no, I can't have you screaming.
Sorry, cookie.
To be my lawful wedded wife, for better or worse.
- What did you say?
- What?
Nothing. I was just rehearsing the wedding ceremony.
To be my lawful wedded wife, for better or worse, for richer or poorer...
- Please, Frizzy.
- What?
Don't, please.
You're very nervous, darling, aren't you?
I know it's been a very exciting day.
Look out!
Frisbee!
Help! Help! Police!
Never mind, operator. Cancel it.
They must have left, Tony, there's no answer.
They should have been here hours ago.
Not the way those old fogies would be driving.
You know what's funny about people?
The older they get, the more careful they are.
You'd think when a guy's seen everything...
Hello. It's Honey.
Hello, Honey. Where are you?
Now, look, we're not down here for fun.
We're having a wedding.
They've had an accident.
Nothing serious.
It just shook the old boys up a little.
I couldn't get to a phone before.
I don't know.
Some little hotel near Kingston.
Twin Oaks Inn it's called.
Yeah.
Sure, Tony, there's a midnight bus.
I can grab that.
Midnight bus. What are you talking about?
I'll have Monte and Joe pick you up in 40 minutes. Yeah, tonight.
I've got a Justice of the Peace waiting.
There'll be a Justice of the Peace tomorrow.
Why not do this thing right?
I want to wait until the old boys have gone to bed.
I can't walk out on them cold.
Maybe you'd like to sit down and knit them seven little sweaters to remember you by...
I've told you how it's going to be.
Now stop barking orders.
So long.
Get the car ready.
Yes...
ELFINl: I can prove to you by the laws of relativity that it wasn't Frisbee that ran into the sign post...
No?
- ... but that it was the sign post that ran...
Hello.
That's all right. Sit down. Go ahead.
But that it was the signpost that ran into Frisbee.
Now let me explain.
If you do, by the same law, your head will run into this bottle.
But before you do, I'd like a drink.
- All right.
- Yes, a drink.
And then, I think I'll hit the hay.
- Get some sleep.
- Oh, why?
Why? The evening is yet young.
Stay with us.
Oh, no, I don't belong here.
This is a bachelor dinner.
ELFINl: Well, but this is different.
No. That's the law.
We've heard from the garage.
The car will be ready in the morning.
Perhaps it will stay together long enough for us to get to Rancocas.
Yes, we'll get an early start.
After issuing an urgent appeal to all signposts not to charge at us.
What time shall we awaken you?
Around 7:30?
I'll be awake all right.
Well, kids, here's to you.
ELFINl: Wassail.
Oh, Frizzy, I...
You know, you boys still have time to warn him.
A man is a goof to marry any woman.
Just let them try and warn me.
He'll have to console us that there aren't six more just like you.
- One for each of us.
- Of assorted ages, of course.
Naturally.
I'd like to keep you all in a locket always.
Seven squirrelly cherubs right out of this world.
- Goodbye, kids.
- Goodbye.
Did you hear that, Frisbee?
I'm a squirrelly cherub.
ELFINl: Come now, Gerkikoff.
I can't understand...
Why? Because I know I'm right.
You're all speaking very glibly on a subject about which you know practically nothing.
Frisbee, if you feel the need of any guidance, may I suggest that you turn to me?
That's right.
You were married once, weren't you?
Genevieve has been dead for some years, but I have relived every moment of our happiness so many times.
My experience is entirely at your disposal.
I'm very much obliged to you, Oddly,
- but I feel that this...
- Please, please, Frisbee.
Think of me as an older brother or father anxious to send you off properly.
- ELFINl: Well, so are we all.
- Yes, yes.
Tenderness. That is what I advocate.
Tenderness and patience.
Genevieve was a pianist.
And we both dabbled at composing.
After our wedding ceremony, we went straight to the Salzburg Festival.
We spent there a beautiful week, filled with promise, and returned home with three excellent compositions for the piano and a short nocturne for flute, two horns, strings, and oboe.
Me, I remember for three months, every time I bade her good night,
I'd kiss the palm of her little hand, astonished at my own boldness.
Genevieve was a blond.
Here's a lock of her hair.
Well, it's lovely, Oddly.
I remember it used to shine a great deal.
There was a song at that time everyone sang.
I always enjoyed listening to it.
That's it.
Please sing it all.
Oh Genevieve
Does anyone else know it?
Sweet Genevieve
The days may come
The days may go
But still the hands of memory weave
The blissfuI dreams
Of long ago
Please go on.
Oh Genevieve
Sweet Genevieve
Thank you. Thank you so much.
The days may come
The days may go
But still the hands
Of memory weave
The blissfuI dreams
Of long ago
It's good, it's good, good, good.
What did you make out of what Oddly was saying?
Ask him, he's the expert.
What's his bungalow number?
Number six.
Oddly!
Oddly, I'm sorry, but I've got to talk this thing out.
I'm all confused.
I'm glad we're here in the dark because this is extremely personal.
What you said before about tenderness,
I mean, about your honeymoon.
Sounds like a beautiful and aesthetic relationship.
But I'm afraid I don't trust myself.
I'm afraid I'm a lot bolder than you are.
Oddly, do you think that would ruin everything?
Why, the very idea that I should have to spend my honeymoon watching her compose nocturnes or sonatas.
I'm a man in love.
It's the first time in my life.
I think of her every waking moment.
I want to take her in my arms.
If this marriage should have been delayed, that is, should be delayed,
I mean, could...
Listen to me, Oddly, I'm all mixed up.
Can a man like that keep his mind on Johann Sebastian Bach?
Oh, Frizzy.
What? I'm terribly sorry.
I don't know how I could have made such a mistake to say such things to a woman.
Don't apologize.
ELFINl: Frisbee?
Frisbee?
- Someone's calling me.
- Are they?
ELFINl: Frisbee, where are you?
Maybe it's just as well.
Oh, Frisbee!
I'll be back.
- Did you call me?
- Yes, Frisbee, we did.
- Frisbee, something came up.
- Oh, really, what is it?
- Well, you see, as we were sitting...
- Yes.
You better tell him.
No, no, I think he better tell him.
- Who?
- Well, you see, there's a gentleman...
I mean, a man is...
Four men...
- He will tell you.
- Yeah, he'll tell you.
I don't understand.
ELFINl: Well, come right inside, and you'll understand.
How do you do?
- So, you're the bridegroom?
- Yes, this is Professor Frisbee.
- Hiya, Hobart?
- How do you do?
I thought you'd look like the rest of these squats, except for a beard with pea soup in it.
Squat? Well, what about me evoked this interest on your part?
Sounds like it's engraved, don't it?
What's all this about?
- It's about Miss Honey.
- Honey?
- Perhaps if we talked to him...
- No, we've had enough detours already.
Maybe you recognize the voice, Hobart, or don't you?
How's the sinus?
Are you her father?
Well, how do you do, Mr...
You're getting warm. I'm her Daddy.
Shut up.
I believe I'm entitled to some clarification.
I would think so.
So am I.
Lipstick.
Here. Here. Here. You can't do that.
- No! No!
- Take it easy.
I was kind of counting on Honey to tell you the score.
The trouble with her is she's okay giving out with the wise cracks and twists, but when it comes to leveling off, she gets chicken.
He's trying to tell us our wedding trip was nothing but a vast lie.
A vast lie. Don't you believe that, Hobart.
There's going to be a wedding.
Honey's going to be the bride, only I'm going to be the bridegroom.
Shake it off.
I'm very obliged to you guys for delivering a hot cargo.
She had to be handled with a lot of care.
Frisbee, it seems that your bride to be...
His bride? That's a laugh.
It seems that Miss Honey has used us to circumvent the police.
I don't believe it.
Professor, you thought she was going to marry you, with your 3,000, what is it, a year?
She spends that much having her toenails painted.
She sulks if she has to wear last year's ermine.
He don't believe it. Look at him.
All right, Professor, suppose you go tell Honey daddy's here.
Tony Crow's the name.
Professor Frisbee. Professor.
- Why, Miss Bragg.
- I hope we're not too late.
Have you married that girl?
You know, she knocked me out nine hours in a closet.
Something told me all along...
Hold the phone, sister, hold the phone.
We traced you through your accident.
There's a warrant from the DA's office for that girlfriend of Tony Crow's.
Where is she?
There's a Mr. Crow waiting for you.
Yeah.
The situation has been explained to me in simple terms.
You needn't worry about the police.
I just spoke to them, told them you had left an hour ago, probably were in Trenton by now.
Thanks, Frizzy.
Thanks for what?
You've given us a fine course in the theory and practice of being a sucker.
Perhaps it wasn't quite worthy of you, choosing us as the subjects of your demonstration.
Seven pushovers.
Like shooting fish in a barrel.
I didn't mean for you to get it this way.
Right in the face.
I've been trying to write you a letter.
Here are all my excuses.
The handwriting of a...
What would be your word for it?
A tramp?
Good morning, Miss Bragg.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning.
How about some nice hot breakfast?
- No, thank you.
- Not for me.
I've made Parker House rolls.
- ELFINl: I don't care for any.
- No, thanks.
Professor Oddly, you may have some jam or apple butter.
I don't think so, Miss Bragg. Thank you.
What? Nobody wants any breakfast?
Miss Bragg, would you mind very much, please...
Would you mind leaving us?
Well!
Flying Schmo's last
Forty lengths behind
Now, gentlemen, before we attempt to go back to work,
I should like to say a few words.
You've all been very kind and very tactful.
Overly tactful, if I may say so.
Now, let's face it,
I made an ass of myself and I know it.
Oh, well, we all did, Frisbee.
Yes, but I was the lead donkey.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
Well, you've had quite an eventful night last night, gentlemen.
At least, so we see by the papers.
It's cost the estate some $300,000 to have its name spread across every tabloid in New York.
"Night club cutie hides out in Totten Foundation. "
- And this one.
- Yes.
"Professor smuggles Honey across state line. "
A Honey smuggler.
I'm sorry, Miss Totten.
For the aforesaid reasons, Miss Totten has decided to discontinue this project.
What?
Don't do that.
One word, Miss Totten.
In your very understandable excitement, a great injustice is being done.
I am the guilty one and I accept my...
- We are all in this together.
- ... dishonorable discharge without any protest, but I don't believe the others should be made to suffer for my misconduct.
My goodness, what's that?
What happened?
- Good morning, teachers.
- Yeah, good morning.
- Now everybody line up over there.
- Just like for a photograph.
With you, Hobart, in the foreground.
Come on, let's get going.
Get around. Get around. Go on.
- Faster. Faster.
- Keep moving.
Come on. Hurry up!
All right now. Sit down, everybody. Make yourself comfortable.
- Hey, Louie?
- Yeah.
Phone the boss and tell him we got everything in cold storage.
How much longer are we going to argue this thing?
- Now, come on, Honey...
- I said no, and no is no.
Listen, Honey, when I was nine years old,
I fell in love with my piano teacher.
She played classical.
- Now, you're not nine years old.
- I love him.
- She loves him.
- Yes, I love him.
I love those Hick shirts he wears with the boiled collars.
And the way he always has his coat buttoned wrong.
He looks like a giraffe and I love him.
I love him because he's a sort of a guy that gets drunk on a glass of buttermilk, and I love the way he blushes right up over his ears.
I love him because he doesn't know how to kiss. A jerk.
I love him, Tony, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
I'll never see him again, but I'm not gonna marry you.
Even if you fill me full of lead, like you did your friend, Ernie Hart.
I told you, I was framed.
I'm beginning to have my own ideas about that.
Hello. Yeah. Okay.
Louie just phoned, boss.
They got them on ice.
Well, this kind of changes things.
Come on, baby, let's go.
- Go where?
- Back to town.
What is this?
Well, let's call it a sort of a shotgun wedding.
Say, what are you trying to pull?
Baby, you've been floating around on a pink cloud.
I want you to take a good look at your friend Frizzy, then maybe you'll come back down to Earth. Come on, let's go.
What's the set up?
Joe and Monte has got them in there.
This room over here is empty.
You wait here.
Hiya, boss.
Everything is under control.
Where'd you get all the people?
I thought there were only seven of them.
They wandered in.
Said they was musicians.
Yeah, I recognize them.
What are hepcats doing in a place like this?
Louie grabbed them.
- They said they was here to play music.
Hello, Hobart.
How... How do you do?
Okay. Hold them here.
Come on in and take a look, baby.
Maybe you'll change your mind.
Well?
We'll be in the room across the hall.
Can we make a deal now, baby?
Sure we can, brother rat.
Adams is gonna get a guy to marry us.
Bring him in as soon as they get here.
Knock off that walking, Hobart.
You make me nervous.
Hobart, will you sit down?
- I beg your pardon.
- Sit down.
There now, all we have to do is wait for the all-clear signal.
We'll dismiss the class right after the ceremony.
Did you say "right after the ceremony?"
That's what the man said.
He said that.
You can hear, can't you?
Do you mean they're not married yet?
Why do you think we're fooling around with these?
I don't know, why?
A little trouble with Honey's vocal chords.
She wouldn't say yes.
"Wouldn't say yes. "
Gentlemen, I've been wrong.
This visit is no longer a mystery.
Apparently it requires those guns leveled on us to force Miss Honey to marry Mr. Crow.
ELFINl: You mean to say...
Yes, I do.
That explains everything.
I knew it.
I believe she loves me.
She really loves me.
No question about it.
Hey! Hey!
She loves you, she loves you not.
So what?
Well, don't you see?
I couldn't possibly permit Miss Honey to marry Mr. Crow under these circumstances.
- Don't you agree, gentlemen?
- Absolutely.
Shut up!
Now sit down. All of you. Go on.
- Just a minute. We...
- Sit down!
Hobart.
Here you are, Tony.
He can't hear any, but he can marry you.
Hello. I'm the groom and that's the bride.
Get going.
I can't hear you.
- I said I'm the groom...
- Too loud.
I'm the groom and that's the bride.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
- Hello.
- And you, too, sir.
I presume you have a license?
Oh, yeah. Here it is.
I must have lost my glasses.
This is gonna be great.
Sure. The best part of it is, he's so near-sighted, he can't recognize us.
I've got them right here.
They don't look so big now, them big musical brains, huh?
Not to me, they don't.
You gentlemen think you're big because you have firearms, because you know how to load them and pull the trigger.
It would be very interesting to teach you the contrary,
- wouldn't it, gentlemen?
- Button it up, understand?
Beg your pardon, gentlemen, we hate to bother you again.
- Well, what you say, Hamp?
- What you say, Satch?
- Bubbles.
- Excuse us, Professor.
We got some more questions.
Maybe you could help us answer.
The first question is, "How did music secure a great military victory?"
We couldn't see what music had to do with winning a battle.
What you all doing, having a meeting here or something?
- What's going on?
- More like a wake, maybe.
- Excuse us.
- Never mind. Sit down.
We got a nice lodge seat for you right in the front row.
Well, I got over here first.
Mister...
Just call me Joe.
Mr. Joe, do you know anything about music?
It's not one of my best points.
I never went in for that kind of stuff, at least not very much.
Yes, well there was a question put to the assemblage a little while ago, which I would like very much to answer.
You don't mind if we talk, do you?
Just keep it funny.
Your question was about music winning a battle.
- We'd just as soon skip it.
- No, no, no. It's a very interesting subject.
I believe the correct answer would be The Battle of Jericho in which music played a vital part.
A very vital part.
That ain't funny, Professor.
Well, I'm hoping it will be in just a moment.
Are you gentlemen familiar with The Battle of Jericho?
Yes, sure.
- Would you mind singing
- a few phrases to musicians, please?
- Sure.
Now, I'd like you to pay particular attention to the meaning of the words.
All right, gentlemen. Please.
The meaning of the words.
Well Joshua fit the battle around Jericho
Around Jericho
Around Jericho
Joshua fit the battle around Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down
God knows then
Joshua fit the battle around Jericho
Around Jericho
Around Jericho
Yes, Joshua fit the battle around Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down
Good morning, sister Mary
Good morning, brother John
I just want to stop and tell you
Just how I came along
You've heard about good old Joshua
Well, he was the son of none
And he never stopped his working
Well, untiI his work was done
Joshua fit the battle around Jericho
Around Jericho
Hey! Break it up.
We don't want any whispering.
Well, I believe we've gone far enough, and we all understand the answer to our problem.
- Don't we, gentlemen?
Yes, yes, indeed.
Now, go on, get to it.
What do you want to do?
Well, I...
We would like to try a little demonstration of the effect of resonance and reverberation.
- I don't know nothing about it.
- Well, we'll try and teach you.
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Thank you.
Now, gentlemen, suppose you play the piece you were playing the other day, as I came into the room.
- You mean, The AnviI Chorus?
- Yes, yes, yes, indeed.
- Wonderful, wonderful.
- Now, a...
- Can we play, too, Professor?
- By all means.
All of you please join in.
Now, our hope is, in the words of Mr. Armstrong, that this particular music might send you out of this world.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Would you sit down, please?
Yeah.
Perhaps you'll be a little more comfortable right here.
All right, gentlemen. If we are all ready now, I suggest that we proceed.
Ready.
- I chose the wrong piece.
You didn't send me at all.
- Me, neither.
- Yes. It was definitely the wrong piece.
I don't like that kind of stuff anyway.
I quite agree with you.
We must go the other way.
Isn't that true, gentlemen?
We must go the other way.
We must change our style.
- Can we help, Professor?
- That's an excellent idea, Mr. Dorsey.
Perhaps if we change our style to swing, that'll help produce the desired result.
Hey, less talk and more music.
I'm sorry. I'd almost forgotten about you.
Just one more thing. As they are playing, would you boys be prepared to cut a rug for this gentleman?
- We dig it, Professor.
- We dig it, Professor.
Yes, indeed.
Now you're talking. That's more like it.
Yes, I thought it was pretty good myself.
What are you gentlemen going to play?
We'd like to try Flying Home.
- That's fine.
- Okay, Mel?
Flying Home.
That's better. That's fine.
Now repeat after me.
- I, Anthony Crow...
- I, Anthony Crow...
Louder, please.
- I, Anthony Crow...
- First class murderer.
- ... take thee, Honey Swanson...
- ... take thee, Honey Swanson...
Who hates and despises you, loathes you.
- ... to be my lawful wedded wife...
- ... to be my lawful wedded wife...
- ... for better or for worse...
- ... for better or for worse...
For worse.
...for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health...
...for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health...
I'm sick already.
- Now cut that out.
- What?
- Never mind. Go on.
- What'd you say?
Go ahead!
- Did you say something?
- No. It's that music in there.
...in sickness and in health...
- You just said that.
- What?
Shall I cut out that racket, boss?
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
- Hey, where's he going?
- He's going to stop the music.
But he can't go. He's a witness.
He's got to remain here through the entire ceremony.
Okay, Adams, forget it. Go ahead.
Now I forgot where I was.
Now I've got to start all over again.
This is going to take all day.
Begin where you left off.
- What did you say?
- Go ahead!
Not so loud! You hurt my ear.
- Now repeat after me. I, Anthony Crow...
- I, Anthony Crow...
ELFINl: Get his gun. Get his gun.
And do you Honey Swanson take this man to be your lawful wedded husband, to live...
No! No, I don't.
- Take their guns.
- Take their guns.
Take his gun away.
Hey, wait, I ain't finished yet.
I'm very glad of that.
Put up your hands, Mr. Crow. Put them up!
Now, Mr. Crow, we'll settle our differences as man to man, without the use of firearms.
Okay, Hobart.
Take it easy, Tony.
Atta boy, Frizzy, give it to him!
Sock him, Frizzy! Go on, hit him.
Atta boy! Give it to him!
Punch him! Give it to him!
Hit him hard! Hit him again!
Listen, you seven wise idiots.
It wouldn't work.
Remember, Frizzy, no women aboard.
Now, above all women, you want to take a dizzy dame like me.
Now, if you will allow me,
I can cite many examples of love stories from the operas to prove the inevitability of this step.
Yes, I have proof even from the older classics.
- From the laws of harmony.
- Yes, indeed.
And the laws of counterpoint.
The music of the masters is sufficient.
Yes, indeed.
- That hasn't anything to do with it.
Yes, it has.
Gentlemen, I know when words cease to be of use, there remains but one argument.
Come here, Miss Honey.
Oh, no, Frizzy, please.
On the book, please.
But, Frizzy. It isn't fair.
Isn't it?
No, it isn't fair.
My goodness!
Hobart, remember my advice on...
Twenty-six thousand prisoners were taken, as well as inestimable booty.
By scoring several hits, our artillery...
a loaded transport which was about to sail to return to harbor.
Another ship exploded under the fire of German anti-tank guns.
State Department in a statement containing the Secretary's comment...
- Captain.
- Yes.
...unofficial reports that extensive bombing in Chungking had been received.
Anyone left the ship, Donkeyman?
Not as I seen, sir.
- New man?
- Yes, sir.
Smith, signed on at Cape Town.
- Check him onboard.
- Yes, sir.
That crazy light don't work, sir.
So why didn't you report it when the lights went out?
All right, Mister.
Check everyone in the fo'c's'le.
Swanson here. McDonald?
What? Oh. Oh, here, sir.
Bergman.
Here.
Davis. Davis!
I'm here.
- In here...
- What is it? What's going on?
What are you doing here, steward?
Just turned in for a wink of sleep, sir.
- You're a mighty quick sleeper?
- Yes, sir. Always was...
- Oh, tick him off.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Do you always sleep with your clothes on?
It's my privilege.
That fellow belong to me.
- Who's missing?
- Driscoll, sir. Bunk's empty.
- Where is he, Swanson?
- Drisk?
Why... Huh.
He was here just a little while ago, sir.
He went to sleep, I suppose, up on fo'c's'le head.
I go find him, tell him you want him, huh?
Stay where you are.
I know that you men have been grumbling about shore leave.
When I found the native police had picked up a seaman ashore,
I guessed it was Driscoll.
Me, sir?
- Did I hear my name, sir?
- Where have you been?
I've been having a bit of a nap on the fo'c's'le head, sir.
Oh, it's a grand evening to be taking a few winks on deck.
With that sun coming over the water, sir,
I was dreaming...
Never mind about that.
Let's have a look at your hands.
The other one.
The back of it, man.
There's a native policeman ashore with a broken jaw.
No skin broken, sir.
Well, I'm glad for once it's someone from another ship.
- Kransky.
- Here.
- Hansen.
- Here.
- Geary?
- Here.
- Rido.
- Here.
What happened, Drisk?
Dawson put up a bit of a fight. Ole.
I'm sneaking back to the boat when two of them native police with their white caps and their brass buttons step out and ask for my pass.
"There's a war on," says they,
"and you're not a neutral."
I never was a...
I never was a neutral in all my life.
- Well, one word led to another.
- What about the ladies?
The ladies will be aboard any minute now with huge, big baskets of fruit.
Fruit?
Hey, what about the booze?
Under the fruit, there'll be a bottle or two like this for each one of you.
- By jingo, we get drunk!
- Shut up, you square-head.
Yeah, shut up.
Would you have the Mate after us?
Well, I hope you enjoyed it.
I did.
There you are.
There's a bumboat coming along the side, sir...
- Right, let them aboard.
- Pardon, sir?
- Let them aboard.
- Yes, sir.
I suppose you're wondering why I'm relaxing discipline.
Why, no, sir. It's none of my business.
I thought the First had told you the orders.
They said the ship was being ordered to the United States, sir, to pick up cargo.
- They tell you what the cargo is gonna be?
- No, sir.
It's ammunition, Mister.
Yes, sir.
Come on. Get them up.
Hey, get back there.
Come on. Get them up there.
Driscoll!
You're in charge of this party.
And no rough stuff.
No, sir.
- You women bring booze?
- Where's the liquor?
Hold your horses, ape!
Is it trouble you're after?
Quiet! All right. All right.
You want the Mate down on our necks to spoil all the fun?
Into the fo'c's'le with them.
Go along now. Come on. Get out of here.
Take them in, fellows. Go on, fellows.
Move along. Shake a leg.
Hey, he's cheating!
You make so much noise, mister.
Good evening.
You buy from me?
Have you anything to drink?
Thanks.
Thanks. Thank you very much.
Smitty.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
Drink?
I've done my share of drinking in my time.
Doctor told me I'd have stop it or die, so I stops.
What's troubling you, Smitty?
That singing on the shore getting your nerves?
If I didn't know we were in the West Indies,
I'd imagine we were anchored off some island of the dead.
The ghosts are wailing, Donkeyman.
Natives is queer.
I've known them to keep on singing like that all night long.
I used to worry a lot about dying.
I don't no more.
Take that singing now.
Sounds kind of nice and sleepy-like to me.
Sleepy? If I listen to it much longer sober,
I'd never get to sleep.
What's bothering you, Smitty?
Oh, memories, Donkeyman.
Best thing to do with memories is forget them.
Suppose you couldn't forget them?
I'd get drunk, same as you're doing.
Whatever set you going to sea on an old tramp like this?
I suppose there's a woman mixed up in it, ain't there?
- There she is.
- Oh, here you are, honey!
You come back!
There's love for you, Smitty.
No memories joined with that.
Every time we get near the land, you get that look on your face.
When a man goes to sea, he ought to give up thinking about things on shore.
Land don't want him no more.
I've had my share of things gone wrong, and all come from the land.
Now I'm through with the land, and the land's through with me.
Too smoky in fo'c's'le. Jiminy!
There's a chap who doesn't worry about it.
He's going back to the land at the end of this voyage.
Olsen? He'll never get home.
Three times I've seen him paid off.
And it's always one drink with the boys and then...
After this trip, he'll stop trying.
Yes, I dare say you're right.
You're different from the rest of us.
Something on land has still got a hold on you.
It's you ought to be going home.
You leave me out of it, Donkeyman.
Who's going to leave you out of it when we get back to England?
I'm not going back.
- The ship is.
- But I'm not.
You mean you're going to desert?
Mind your own business, Donkeyman.
Play us a tune, you lug!
An Irish tune!
Hey, Ed. Want a drink?
Yeah, thanks.
Say, isn't it great?
We're gonna booze it on up with a...
You no dance, senor?
I no like these men.
I like you.
Dance with me, querido.
I be your girl.
Dance with...
I don't dance.
Oh, Smitty. Smitty, you dog.
Gee, I almost popped you.
You and me is friends, Smitty, ain't we?
- Right you are, Yank.
- Ain't we? Sure.
Any pal of mine can have anything I got, Smitty. Anything.
And she's a good-looker, ain't she,
Smitty, huh? Ain't she?
Come on, honey.
Boy, she's got a lot of fire, too, huh?
Here, have a drink. Go on. Go on.
Hey, baby, wait minute.
You done that on purpose, you hairy ape.
Who you calling a hairy ape?
You!
You're a cold punching swab.
Well, did you see him?
What I want to know is, are we all friends or not?
- Why, sure we're friends.
- There now, have a drink.
- I will.
- God bless you.
Hey! Come on deck!
Seamen and firemen fighting, sir.
What's going on here?
They were, all of them, having a bit of a harmless fight, sir.
Knife wound to the shoulder, sir.
- Who knifed him?
- I don't know, sir.
It's only a scratch, hit his head on the deck when he fell.
Take him aft. I'll bandage him up.
Look at this, sir.
So that's the trouble, Driscoll.
Take him aft.
- You'll get no money for this last work.
- But...
I'll teach you to smuggle rum on a ship and start a riot.
But señor Capitan.
You know the agreement. Rum, no money.
We bring no rum. I no lie to you, senor.
These sailors, they bring the rum.
- We bring no rum.
- You're lying!
Clear out! Your boat's alongside.
Get along.
None of your lip, or I'll put you ashore and have you locked up.
Hop it.
Go on. Hop it. Come on. Move 'em on!
Come on, ladies. Come on.
Mate say we sail at sunrise.
For England.
American port first for cargo, then we go home.
Then I go home.
Time to turn in, Smitty.
Hello, Captain. How are you?
That's your ship? That's good.
I can just see Ole behind that plow.
Ole be putting a rudder on the horse's tail and a compass on the plow, so that he'll not be digging potatoes when it's turnips he's after.
Hey, Ole, show us how you used to call them pigs.
If I was a swine, I'd be running the other way after that devilin' screech.
You won't go home. You'll get drunk.
The only way you'll see that farm is through a bottle.
You stop that.
Stop what, square-head?
You don't make a fool of Ole.
He's going home.
By devil, you've got no home.
I got no home.
None of us got a home but Ole.
And if you stop him, I fight you.
You go home, Ole.
Your mother is old. Where's my hat?
She needs you. She wants you.
You don't go anymore on sailing.
That's no good, Ole. That's no good.
You go home to your mother.
She's old, and she needs you.
Yeah, I go home.
You go home.
And here are your instructions for the stowage of high explosives.
- High explosives.
- Are your cargo holds quite dry?
Oh, yes.
I'm not worried about keeping the cargo dry, but about getting through the war zone.
We haven't enough speed to run away from a rowboat.
Not even a machine gun to make a fight of it.
If anything hits us below the waterline, we'd go up like a kite.
Nevertheless, every ship that gets to England is helping to win the war.
And every officer and man in the merchant marine is doing his bit.
- Unsung heroes...
- Is this when you want us to sail?
Oh, yes. Time is very important, you know.
Is it?
Unsung heroes.
Like a curse!
Hey, Yank. Drisk.
Come here.
- Hey. Hey, did you know about this?
- What are you talking about?
I was wondering what all them blooming uniformed guards were hanging around for.
- That explains it.
- TNT.
TNT, it's high explosives.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
It's worse. It's ammunition.
- By jiminy Christmas.
- The devil with it.
Load up an old hooker like this full of that blooming stuff and what is she? Just a bomb!
A great, big dynamite bomb!
I quit!
Well, we're all quitting, I'm thinking.
I'm through.
Captain wants you out, men.
Everybody out.
Sir, what's the meaning of this?
Captain will answer your questions.
But we didn't sign on for the kind...
- Okay, hop it. He's waiting.
- Well, so are we.
All right, let the old man himself explain...
By devil, I quit!
I ain't gonna sign on this old tub again.
As far as this job's concerned, you men haven't got any names.
You're just so many hands, just as I am a boss to see this cargo gets to England.
If it doesn't get there, it'll be missed, but we won't.
Now I know it's the usual thing for the fo'c's'le hands to grouse.
So if anybody's got any objection to what I've said, well, step forward. Let's hear it.
Right. Well from now on till you're paid off in London, you get 25% bonus on your wages.
There's one thing more.
Owing to circumstances over which I've got no control, nobody is allowed to leave the ship.
May I ask, sir, why are we deprived of shore leave?
For your own safety.
I don't want the cargo talked about ashore.
I think I can be trusted, sir.
When you're drunk?
I maintain, sir, that we're entitled to one night ashore before sailing.
Yeah, I maintain you've said enough, Smith.
I'm as interested in the welfare of my ship's crew as you are.
No more of your lip.
Go on. Back to your work.
Roust out, Cocky.
Can't you let a man sleep?
What about the rest of us?
The old man wants his coffee.
That means he's going to the bridge.
And that means we're gonna sail.
Shake a leg!
Can't let a man sleep.
I'll expose him.
Coffee!
- Well, Captain, goodbye and good luck.
- Goodbye, thank you.
Are you quite sure you won't want a pilot?
No, no pilot.
- Well, bon voyage.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
All clear!
- He came off the Glencairn.
- Let's take him aboard!
On your feet!
Take it away!
One of your men, isn't he, mate?
Yes. Get aboard, Smith!
Get aboard. Take it away!
Good night, Drisk.
Good night, Donkeyman.
Sweet dreams, too.
Full speed ahead, Mister.
Alter course.
East by north. Half knot.
East by north. Half knot.
Stop that noise!
You square-headed ape.
He was playing soft, Drisk.
Slow her down a few turns.
By golly, I would hate to be on this old tub in rough weather.
Hey, Cocky. Hurry up that Scotch.
Come on! Let's shake a leg!
Come on, Old Murphy. I'll help you.
Come on.
Boys, coming... There you are.
Now, there you are.
Them sea biscuits would break the tooth of a lion if he had the misfortune of biting one.
Nothing but scarf upon these rusty...
Swill, that's right.
It's a starvation ship. My last trip!
Plenty of work and nothing to eat.
And the owners riding around in carriages.
I think it's that blasted cook.
Fresh meat for the officers and hash for the men. That's his notion.
Hash, hash! Stew, stew!
Marmalade, by jiminy!
We hit something?
It was the anchor.
The anchor's broke loose!
- Contact...
- Yank!
Mr. Graves?
Steady kid.
Let me... Let me lie down.
I need to lie down.
Excuse me, sir, but the men in the fo'c's'le are asking if you'll take another look at the sick man.
Is he worse?
He's spitting blood again, sir.
Can you do anything for him, sir?
Well, as far as I can make out, those splintered ribs have punctured his lung.
Can you do anything about that, Mister?
- Why, no, sir.
- No, neither can I, and I don't think I'm fooling anybody, pretending to be a doctor.
Damn! If it had only happened a week later, we might have made port.
As it is...
All right, Mister. When you leave, first tell him to come here.
I'll go forward and see what I can do.
Yes, sir.
A book and a box of physic!
Suffering Moses!
It's colder than kittens up there.
How's Yank, Drisk?
- Your wheel, Scotty.
- Aye.
Who's watching lookout?
Me and Drisk.
Oh, it's nothing but dirty weather this whole voyage.
Are you feeling better now, Yank?
You look better. Much better.
Am I telling him a lie?
- Sleep done you good, Yank.
- Sure it has.
In no time at all now, you'll be having a pint a beer with us in Limehouse.
What are you all lying for?
You think I'm afraid?
You think I'm scared?
Don't you be thinking such thoughts.
Don't be leaving me, Drisk.
- Ole?
- Here, Yank.
Don't leave me.
I'm dying, I tell you.
I won't stay here alone.
I'll go out on deck.
There, there, now.
Don't you be worrying, Yank!
I'll not stir a step out of here, and let that devil of a man curse his black head off.
I take your watch, Ole.
Get me some water. Quick.
Here, here you are, lad.
There you are.
He's just up and having a fainting spell, sir.
Isn't this your watch, Driscoll?
Yes, sir, but Yank was fearing to be alone and...
- Well, that's all right, Driscoll.
- Thank you, sir.
Did he take the medicine I sent?
Yes, sir, but it wouldn't stay down.
I'm afraid he's very weak.
Please, sir. Find some way to help him.
My good man, I'm not a doctor.
You and him been shipmates a long time, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
Well, keep him quiet, and we'll hope for the best.
I'll raid the med room and send some medicine, something to ease the pain anyhow.
You'll be up tomorrow.
We'll pull you through, all right.
Well, keep your courage up.
Coming, Mister?
Didn't I tell you?
Sure the Captain will have you on deck chipping rust before the week is out.
Don't lie, Drisk.
I'm gonna die. The sooner, the better.
Oh, by the Holy, you lad.
I'll not let you. I'll not let you.
Give me a drink of water.
My throat's burning up.
How's Yank?
It's asleep, he is.
No, I ain't, Drisk.
I was just dreaming.
I thought I was way in the middle of land, where you could never smell the sea or look at a ship.
Prop me up a little, will you?
So I can breathe.
Thanks.
Where's Ole?
Ole?
Here, Yank.
This ain't no life, Ole.
If you don't leave it this trip, you never will.
Sure. We'll both put him on his way home soon as we're all paid off.
Remember the times we've had in Buenos Aires?
- That dance hall in Barracas. Remember?
- I do indeed.
Yeah.
And the stink of the hides in La Plata.
Give me a puff, Drisk.
Remember the night
I went crazy with the heat in Singapore?
And the time we both got locked up for fighting in Sydney. I do indeed.
That fight on the dock in Cape Town.
I can see his face in front of me.
That guy that I...
Let you not be thinking of that now.
That's done and gone and forgot.
It was done in fair fight.
In self-defense, wasn't it?
- Wasn't it, Drisk?
- Indeed it was.
Didn't he try to stab you in the back and you not suspecting?
I wish I had no blackened deed on my soul.
Where's all that fog coming from, Drisk?
Fog?
How'd it get in here?
Of course, lad, it's...
It's just coming in the alleyway.
That's funny.
I thought I could hear the wind blowing outside.
Yank, lad,
I never asked you, but have you no relations at all that you could call your own?
Drisk.
- Drisk?
- Yes, Yank?
Remember that little barmaid in the Red Stork in Cardiff?
She was a good kid.
Swell kid.
Lent me dough when I was broke.
Buy her something to...
Give me a drink.
Yank?
Yank, speak to me, lad.
Yank!
Captain sent this medicine for Yank.
He say it would take away his pain where he's hurting.
Yank's gone?
"Before the light of God."
"He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
"Our Lord Jesus Christ, our glorious majesty.
"The seas will give up her dead..."
Thank you, sir.
There's your coffee, Scotty, if you can call it coffee.
What are you doing?
I just paint windows, Drisk.
Have I no eyes in the front of my head?
Mate's orders, Drisk.
We show no lights.
With the submarines lying about...
You mean, we're in the war zone?
We'll be tonight.
I heard the old man tell the Second.
Wouldn't you think that leg of a Mate would pass the word?
They ain't pasting up no bulletins to let the crew know anything.
I don't like this much.
The lifeboats are ready, ain't they?
Sure, lower them in a second.
Next time I ship on windjammer,
Boston to River Plate, loaded with wood only so she float, by golly!
Well, I'm... Lord!
They're not half smart, them blighters.
What are you buzzing about?
It's written down here in print, or I wouldn't believe it.
It's a true confession.
Confession of what, man?
The fifth column.
Fifth column?
It tells here how a German spy in Paris was writing messages to a woman spy in Switzerland, who sent them on to Berlin, Germany.
That's nothing.
Nothing, is it?
Wait till you hear how they done it.
To read their messages, you wouldn't suspect anything, see.
A lot of mush.
The fellows in the War Office that opens them thinks they're nothing but love letters, you see? But they have a code.
What do you mean, code?
What do I mean?
I'll tell you what I mean.
They have a piece of paper with a lot of little holes cut out in it, and when they put it on top of the letters, they see only the words that tell them what they want to know.
And the Frenchmen get beaten up for it all on account of one letter.
That's bad.
The conniving, murdering, tricking...
That's the truth.
Here, you can read it for yourself.
No, no, you keep it.
That code, that's no good, by devil!
Come on, Scotty, or the Mate will be down on our necks. Your wheel, ain't it?
Aye.
Shocking! Outrageous! Preposterous!
Hash, stew, marmalade, submarines.
Codes, by devil!
East by north. Three quarters north.
East by north. Three quarter north.
Do you smell the land, Smitty?
Aye, a day and a night now.
Don't let it trouble you, Smitty.
Crew don't let on.
But they're always kind of nervous when they get into the war zone first time.
Thanks for the compliment, Donkeyman.
I hope you won't tell anyone you saw me shaking with fear.
- Oh, I didn't mean...
- Haven't you ever needed a drink?
Haven't you felt every nerve in your body demanding whiskey?
Haven't you felt like screaming because...
Oh, what's the use of talking about it?
You don't know what I mean.
Indeed, indeed I do.
Look, take my advice.
Don't leave the ship.
I'm staying onboard. You won't be alone.
Couple of days in port, and then away to sea again. Why not?
What's it going to be, Smitty?
One big drunk or more memories?
No, I'm gonna enlist.
Good. Navy needs you.
Navy?
No, I'm going in the army if they'll have me.
Skipper wanted his binoculars.
Must've left them in the chart room.
"International Code of Signals,
British Edition."
Why aren't you up there where you belong?
I see lights from ship.
Right there. First, I think she's submarine, by golly.
I don't see nothing.
She wink on. She wink off.
Then she wink away. I see it.
Someone is making signals.
No, you're looney.
No, by devil, I see light.
All right, all right. Get up on the topside before the Mate sees you.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Nearly eight bells, Scotty.
Rise and shine, Ole.
Come on, you guys. Shake a leg.
Get out of there.
- Fog still thick?
- Sure, cut it with a knife.
Bloody hate the fog, unless you can hear the foghorn.
Well, what do you wanna do, Cocky?
Whistle up a few submarines?
Blasted U-boats.
I hope the British navy sinks them all.
Not only the submarines we have to fear, that's what I'm thinking.
Oh, you don't have to worry about mines as far out as this.
I wasn't thinking of mines either.
Your wheel, Ole?
My lookout.
- Ain't it your deck watch?
- Yes, yes. Surely.
- I can't figure that guy out.
- No, no one has.
Watch that light!
Sorry, Drisk.
- Do you know what I caught him doing?
- What?
Going through the old man's code books.
Nah! Smitty, good fellow.
Wanna get square-headed...
Wait till you hear what I seen.
Ole, I see light.
She wink on. She wink off.
Then she wink away.
- Sure, Axel.
- Yeah.
Hit the bunk!
Taking a gander at the chart.
I think the ship's not safe with the fellow.
I think I'll sleep outside on deck.
I tell you, I see that light. She wink on.
She wink off. Just like wigwag.
And that's another thing.
How did I forget that?
I thought the square-head was seeing things. Maybe he ain't so dopey after all.
I'm coming along the deck, see, with a coffee pot when...
Curse that fog!
Curse him thick!
Who's the lug put his cup where a man'd sit on it.
Smitty.
He think he's such a fine gentleman that he can't put his own away the same as the rest of us?
- He use for get dressed, Smitty, all right?
- All right, is he?
Of course he's all right!
Can't you keep your tempers?
It's this blasted fog.
The thought you might be blown to smithereens any minute.
It's my last trip through the zone, so it is.
Devil take them and their 25% bonus.
Be caught like a rat in the trap in the bargain maybe.
- So you think the Duke's all right?
- Now look here, my boy...
Look, there it is. That's it.
Are you all crazy?
The light. That's where it comes from.
What'd I tell you?
Hey! You're showing the lights, you lug.
- Who left that open?
- Smitty.
Who has done it if Smitty didn't?
It's over his bunk, isn't it?
She wink on. She wink off.
Just like wigwag.
Hey, what's going on here behind my back?
That's what we're trying to tell you, Drisk.
Maybe you won't be thinking so much of the Duke when you hear it.
All right, all right. Out with it.
Stop winking and nodding and making a mystery of things.
Keep your eye on the door.
- Sing out if you see Smitty coming.
- Yeah.
I see him in the chart room, getting a fix on our course.
I caught him in the Captain's cabin, pouring over the code book, the International Code book.
Easy-peasy.
Take it easy, Drisk.
Shut up.
By jiminy! By devil!
Are you gonna have it out on deck?
Why should we stay here and be blown to bits?
Are you frightened, you toad?
Well, it's a fine thing when full grown men shiver like children at the sight of a little black box.
Still, it's a devilish thing, the look of it.
"A bit of a black box," you call it?
How big do you think it has to be?
As big as this fo'c's'le?
It looks bad, so it does.
There's only one consolement.
The traitor's English.
Who says he's English?
Haven't you read how all them German spies has been living for years in London and talks the King's English, as good as I do.
He talks English too good.
That's what I mean.
That's right.
I never met a swell that talked the way he does.
Now, listen, Drisk, was he ever open with us like a good shipmate?
No, he always keeps to himself like he was hiding something.
And the name he calls himself, Smith.
I'll bet a buck on my next payday that his real name is Schmidt.
Schmidt.
By devil, Schmidt!
Devil take me if I don't think you have the truth of it.
I wish he didn't come back after he jumped ship in United States.
Jumped ship. Jumped ship!
He was passing the word to some German bloke about the ammunition we're carrying.
I'll lay odds he was trying to sneak in onboard when they nabbed him.
Well, I never was afraid of anything or anyone.
- Don't monkey with it.
- Let's see face to face.
- Now get out of here!
- Careful, Drisk.
- Get that bucket of water.
- What are you gonna do with it, Drisk?
I'll show you what I'll do with this Devil's machinery.
The devil's got you hot as a clam bake?
You guys keep out of this. Stand back.
- Good work, Drisk.
- Now, she don't blow up, by golly.
- What do you mean "blow up"?
- You pipe down.
Now, let's find this blaggart.
They hang spies on shore, don't they?
Over the side with him, and one man missing in the morning.
He'll go over the side, all right, but not till after he's had a fair trial.
Ain't you seen enough, Drisk?
If Yank, God rest his soul, was here, he'd agree with me. Johnny. Davis.
I found it.
We found it under his bunk.
Yeah, under his mattress.
- There's a bomb in there.
- I knew. I knew that fellow.
Here, just what's...
If this is your idea of a joke...
We'll show you how much of a joke it is before we're through with you.
If you'll be good enough to explain...
It's you who'll do the explaining, my fine gentleman.
Look at it, you dirty swine.
- Look at it!
- What is it?
Thought you wasn't half a fox, didn't you?
It's mine.
What are you doing with my things?
What's in it?
Would you tell us to our faces?
- That's my business.
- Well, we're making it our business.
Get his keys.
See if he has one that'll open it.
Don't you open that, Driscoll.
If you do, so help me,
I'll kill you if I hang for it.
I am not the one to be killed.
I'm no dirty spy.
- Spy?
- We're on to your tricks.
Hiding this box under your mattress so you could sneak out later and put it in the hall.
What are you talking about, you fool?
I only put it there so that I could get it quick in case we were torpedoed. You must be insane!
Keep your mouth shut!
What are you talking about?
Let me get out of this...
- Wait.
- Get back there, you lot!
Stand back, you hairy ape!
It's...
It's nothing but a packet of letters.
Letters, what did I tell you?
That's why he was going through the code book.
Letters are worse than bombs sometimes.
Where else would spies get their orders from if it wasn't from letters?
What orders would he be getting, do you suppose?
Open it and find out.
The name written here is,
"Thomas Fenwick."
That's no more his name than Smith.
Schmidt, that's this guy's real tag.
You don't suppose he'd be using his own name, do you?
It's a foreign postmark by the looks of it.
Look at the stamp.
B-E-R...
Berlin!
I knew them letters was from Germany.
Berlin, by devil!
Read it, Drisk.
I'm not much of a hand at reading, but it begins, "Tom, darling."
"Tom, darling"?
- Read it out louder.
- Yeah, out loud.
"Tom, darling,
"Clive said he'd seen you at Gibraltar
"before you sailed for Malta.
"It wasn't anything he said, but his manners seemed queer,
"and I was terribly uneasy
"until your letter arrived.
"There is only one thing, Tom, darling,
"can wreck our lives,
"and that is this black shadow."
- Black shadow?
- Code word.
Sure, go on. Go on.
"Whenever you're tempted, dearest man,
"think of those who love you.
"Of Tommy and Betsy
"and of your own Elizabeth."
- Elizabeth?
- That's how it's signed.
- Queer.
- What does it mean then?
By the Holy, here's one addressed to this ship.
- Read it.
- "S. S. Glencairn."
That was five months ago in Montevideo.
The writing's bad in this one.
Same hand, only a little shaky.
"Tom, darling,
"it's only from your chance meeting with Harry
"that I know where to reach you.
"I know now that you hadn't stopped
"drinking.
"That you couldn't stop.
"That you lied about it.
"But I know you lied to give me peace of mind.
"Always hoping you could fight it out
"and make it come true.
"My heart broke at the thought of your trial,
"and I nearly died when your letter finally came
"like a note from the grave
"telling me that, for my own sake,
"you would never return to England.
"Dear, dear man,
"loss of a commission is not loss of life.
"There is no disgrace we can't go through together.
"I refuse to tell the children, as you asked,
"that their father is dead.
"He'll never be dead to me because I love him.
"Oh, Tom.
"Tom, you must come back to us.
"Elizabeth.
"His Majesty, the King,
"has been graciously pleased to authorize
"the issue of the..."
What the devil am I reading that for?
Get the hell out of here, you black lugs!
- Swine!
- By devil!
Go on. Get yourselves a wink of sleep.
All's well, Smitty?
All's well, Ole.
Ole? Axel?
Yeah?
Do you not smell the land?
The sweet smell of Ireland.
The fields and the forests, the green hills.
But that's England that way.
Did I ask you?
Make anything of it, Mister?
They're flying above the clouds.
I suppose it must be our lads coming in for patrol.
Machine guns, bombs, bullets!
Hash, you marmalade!
By devil, I quit!
Quick! Hide! Quick! You...
Number Two lifeboat.
Give me a hand to lower this lifeboat.
Clear the shocks.
Sure, Smitty.
Veer your ship. Break your course, man.
Break your course.
Mrs. Fenwick.
Well, Smitty got home.
He's gone.
Gone.
Smitty's gone.
There you are, the last penny.
Put your mark there.
He can write, Mister.
Wanna sign up for the next voyage, Olsen?
No, sir. I go home this time.
- Thank you.
- Is that all?
Aloysius Driscoll.
Aloysius Driscoll.
I know you men will want another berth when you've spent your money.
So if anybody wants to sign on for the next voyage before you go ashore, you can do so now. So speak up.
Right. That's all.
I'm signing on, sir.
All right.
They'll be back, all right.
All except Olsen, sir.
Olsen.
Well, we'll see.
Come on now, lads. Shake a leg.
It's the last I wanna see of this rusty...
There, by golly, you don't spend that money. That's for farm.
Ole!
Come on! Hurry up!
- Come on!
- Come on!
The first thing we do is put Ole on his boat.
- But first, we go to the ticket office.
- Ticket office!
Ticket office is the word, and I'll show you the way, and then we'll go to Joe's Place.
And after that, we...
Who the devil are you, you little pish-posh?
Nick is the name, shipmate.
Nick is the name, mates, and I'm glad to meet you one and all.
Now this here is a card for Joe's Place.
Lovely dancing girls, bow-wow, no chance of being robbed, and the best drinks in town.
Drinks?
There'll be no drinks till we put Ole on his boat!
That's right, Drisk.
You're making a mistake, shipmates!
Best spot in town for a drink.
Nice girls to dance with...
Any of you shellbacks looking for a berth?
What ship is that?
Amindra.
Sailing tonight for Valparaiso.
We need another seaman.
The Amindra. The Amindra!
A starvation tub, if ever I saw one.
Rotten grub, work night and day, and your skull split open if you open your mouth!
No wonder you can't get no crew, you bluenose...
- Sling your hook!
- Stay away from me, I'm warning you.
Come on, Drisk!
I'll catch up with you one of these days, you bluenose blaggart!
Amindra. Amindra.
Svensk Engelsk. Yeah, that's it.
In you go, Ole.
In you go, and buy your ticket.
Well, now, that's settled.
There's Ole's ticket!
Here, I take Ole's ticket.
By golly!
There, you got money for farm, and stick ticket for Stockholm, and you don't lose.
Now, you're all right!
And now, lads, we've got a little time on our hands.
Time, mates?
The pilot's aboard, yo-heave-ho!
Anchor's away, and we'll steer a course for Joe's Place.
And just to show that my heart's in the right place,
I'll tell you what I'll do, mates.
I'll stand a drink all round.
Drink! Preposterous!
There'll be no drink till that one's safe aboard.
That's the gospel truth.
Of course, a glass of beer maybe to wish Ole on his way.
And drink a toast to Smitty.
And Yank.
Smitty and Yank.
Yeah, Yank...
That's a grand idea.
You know, mate, when I seen you chaps coming ashore, my heart was touched, thinking of the way our sailor lads is suffering these days.
Hearts of oak, I said.
Axel!
Sing us another one.
By golly, that's good beer!
You want a drink?
Ole, good luck to you!
Ole!
One glass of beer.
- The boat!
- The boat!
The boat! The boat!
- The boat!
- Wish! Wish! With a wish!
Do you hear it?
Do you hear what they're playing?
Tipperary.
But it's a grand night to be whirling about in some fine...
Yeah, but don't you...
One dance! Just one dance!
Come on. Come on.
Sorry, you civilians can't go in there.
That's for these lads going off to war.
Going off to war!
Is there any place on land or sea where there is no war?
That's it. Move along. Get off the street.
Get inside somewhere.
Best place to be during a blackout.
Blackout. Blackout. Blackout.
Blackout.
Everywhere people stumbling in the dark.
Is there to be no more light in the world?
Is there no place in this dark land where a man who's drunk can find a decent bit of fun?
What have I been telling you all evening, mate?
Don't let them get your egg out.
Come on with me to Joe's Place.
Lots of lovely girls and no blooming copper telling you what you can do or what you can't do.
Devil take me, but I remember this place.
Ship ahoy, me hearties! Happy to see you home again safe and sound.
Ship ahoy.
Ship ahoy, is it?
So it's you, you blaggart!
Five, six years ago,
I was robbed of my last bob in this place in me sleeping.
Devil stiffen you!
If you come any of your tricks over me this time, I'll...
You're mistaken, mate.
This is an honest place, this is.
Oh, yes, and you're a blushing angel,
I suppose.
Well, no matter.
It's past and gone forgot.
I'm not a man to be holding hard feelings my first night ashore.
- And me drunk as a log.
- Quite right. You've got my vote.
What's it gonna be? What's your pleasure?
What'll it be? What's...
- Irish whiskey!
- Same here.
Come on! Cut it out, will you?
Axel, my ticket! Where's my ticket?
In your coat, lad.
In your coat. There it is.
Large as life.
You couldn't lose that without losing the coat itself.
Well, we go soon, Drisk.
I don't wanna miss boat to Stockholm.
Sure, lad, and fine shipmates we'd be if we didn't see you on your way, but you've ladles of time!
- Sure!
- Quiet down!
Aye, I'll treat you a toast, lads!
May the devil burn that black Scot of a Mate.
- Yeah! I'll drink to that!
- What will you have, mate?
He'll have a pint of beer.
And you know who'll pay for it? I will.
Now, it won't do you the least bit of harm, mate.
Why, you're the strongest in the whole lot.
Here, stand up. Come on.
Don't be afraid. Come on. Up. Stand up.
There you are. That's the kind of fo'c's'le on hand that skippers is looking for.
He'll have just a pint of beer, Joe, on me.
No, he won't have a pint on you!
He won't have a pint on anybody!
You stop talk like that!
Oh, I just take one.
Ole, hold that.
All right.
You just take one drink, and I hurt you!
I agree with the square-head.
Nothing for Ole.
All right, I just take ginger beer.
- What?
- He say ginger beer.
He wants ginger beer!
- Ginger beer!
- Oh, ginger beer.
What devils...
Well, I was just telling Joe the ladies is coming over to have a drink with you.
And what lovely, what beautiful, what seductivity.
Ladies, if I may?
Hello, mates.
Ship ahoy!
Provocative! Tantalizing.
Have a good voyage?
A rotten voyage, but never mind that.
My name's Freda. Hers is Kate.
Hers is Meg.
You're welcome, as the saying is.
Are you gonna buy us a whit?
I like them fat!
Come on, square-head.
Play us a tune, an Irish tune.
Would you care to dance?
No, I go now.
Where you going?
Goodbye, Axel.
I'll think you don't like me if you don't come back.
Well, you is wrong. I do like you.
Why won't you come back then?
Won't you come in and have a pint with me?
I go home. I catch boat.
Well, you don't wanna go without a sweetheart to say goodbye to, do you?
Please.
All right, I just take a ginger beer.
Won't you sit down? Over here.
All right, shipmates, come on out the back room.
Everything is free and easy there, and we got a lovely gramophone, and the cops can't hear us. Come on.
Now tell me something about yourself.
Where was you born?
- In Norway?
- No.
- Denmark.
- No.
- Then it must be Sweden.
- Ja.
Ain't that funny? I was born there, too.
- Where, Miss Freda?
- In Sweden.
- Do you speak Swedish?
- Oh, no.
You see, my old man and woman come here to England when I was only a baby.
I'm an orphan, you know.
And they was speaking English before I was old enough to learn.
So I never knew Swedish. I wished I had.
No place like your home, I says.
Ja.
I leave home when I was kid.
Now, I don't leave no more.
I got all the sea I want for my whole life.
What did you do before you was a sailor?
I work on farm till I'm 16.
And we lived...
My mother and brother live.
My father is dead.
We live on farm just little way outside Stockholm.
I got plenty money now.
Sewn in pocket. Two years' pay.
How clever.
You'll be getting married, too, I suppose.
You got a sweetheart?
Oh, I don't know, Miss Freda,
I think so. I...
Well, I...
What's your hurry?
You haven't bought me my drink yet.
I only takes a drop of gin now and again.
For my health.
A drop of gin, Joe, if you please.
With a beer chaser.
You hear that, Joe?
A drop of gin and a beer chaser for her ladyship.
Right-o.
Now, come on, sailor. Come on.
You can't let the little lady drink all alone.
- Well, I...
- Please.
Now, come on. Sit down. Sit down.
You got a new matey, you know.
Here, what you gonna have?
Well, then I take a little ginger beer.
- Ginger beer.
- Small one.
Small ginger beer. You shall have it.
No! No.
Tell me something about your old lady.
Your mother, she won't be half glad to see you, will she?
Does she know you're coming?
No, I thought I just give her a surprise.
She must be old, ain't she?
You know, Miss Freda,
I don't see my mother in...
Must be 10 years.
Oh, I write to her once in a while.
She writes many times.
My brother, he writes, too.
My mother say in all her letters,
"You come right home!"
And I write back always, "I come soon."
And I mean all time to go at end of voyage.
But I come ashore. I take one drink.
I take two drinks. I...
I ship away for another voyage.
Something always happens.
Here we are.
And I took the liberty of having one myself.
Skol.
- Hear her. Skol!
- Skol!
More beer!
Well, this time I go home.
I feel homesick for farm and to see my people again. I...
Just like little boy, I feel homesick.
My mother, she gets old. I want to see her.
She might die. I would...
Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy!
- Can I keep the parrot?
- Oh, you...
What devil's trick is this?
What kind of... Where's Ole?
Who?
The big lad, Ole!
Oh, him. Oh, he left on a steamer.
He said he couldn't wait.
And he told me to say goodbye.
Ole go home.
The big lug made it.
Ole's gone home to Stockholm.
We still have time to go and say bon voyage. Come on.
Before you go, how about a farewell drink on the house?
- Good idea. Good idea. Good idea.
- Come on. Let's get out of this rat hole.
Ole's gone.
What'll you have, whiskey?
Irish whiskey.
That's a queer thing for Ole to be doing.
If Ole's gone to the steamer, Drisk, we got time to catch him.
Well, we've come to see him off anyway.
Well, come on now. Sling your hooks!
- Shall we go?
- Goodbye, mate!
- Happy trip.
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
It's not in my nature to feel unkindly toward any man, to be holding a grudge inside of me when I might let bygones be bygones.
- Thank you, mate.
- So feeling in a merciful mood toward you
- when I might never see you again...
- Now.
...it would be a hard thing to have on me.
Of course, it would. Of course.
So...
Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy!
Excuse me, mates, but you haven't got it quite right. It goes something like this.
- Where's Ole?
- Where's Ole?
- What did you do to him?
- Where's Ole?
Driscoll.
Yes, Driscoll, you...
- Ole!
- Ole!
Come on!
Quick!
Ole! Ole! Ole!
Give me...
Come on. Go on. Get him off here. Quick.
Hurry up! Hurry up, there. Hurry up!
All clear!
Take him forward.
Drisk.
Where's Ole?
Ole go home.
- Good.
- Yeah. Ole go home to Stockholm.
Where's Drisk?
What happened to Driscoll?
Drisk gone.
- Gone? Gone where?
- Amindra.
He sail on that devil ship Amindra.
He's gone.
He's gone.
English
In Europe, as the 17th century dawned...
... mankind was lifting itself
from ignorance and superstition.
The old frontiers of the mind
were rolling back.
New books, new methods
were aiding man...
... in his climb
toward knowledge and wisdom.
In the laboratory.
In the arts.
In every field of endeavor
man was lifting himself hand over hand...
... climbing onward, ever upward.
And on the outskirts of London
on a summer night...
... another man was lifting himself
hand over hand...
... climbing upward, ever onward...
... toward his objective.
- Catherine?
- Don Juan.
Oh, why have you kept me waiting?
I thought you'd never come.
See how my heart is pounding.
Beloved, no power on earth would have kept me from you.
In all this world, there's been but one image in my heart.
- One vision before my eyes.
- Yes, yes, go on.
I have loved you since the beginning of time.
But you only met me yesterday.
Why, that was when time began.
Don Juan.
My incomparable Don Juan.
Yes, yours and yours only.
I wish I could believe you.
But you've made love to so many women.
Catherine...
...an artist may paint a thousand canvases before achieving one work of art.
Would you deny a lover the same practice?
But how long will you love me?
Sweet lady, love is not measured in terms of time...
...only in ecstasy.
It's a beautiful night.
How bright the moon is shining.
Is there a moon?
It will be eclipsed when my husband returns.
Love like ours will never be eclipsed.
Your husband?
You said you were unmarried.
I said I was unattached.
And since I'm not attached to my husband,
I told you the truth.
But let's not speak of husbands.
- It's such a tedious subject.
- Yes, of course.
And there's really no need to worry.
He's on a hunting trip.
- He's extremely fond of grouse.
- Grouse, eh?
And besides...
...we have only these few moments.
A few moments? How few, loved one?
What is time?
A week, a day, an hour, a minute?
Time flies.
And he always blows his trumpet when he returns.
Catherine, look, got a grouse.
Got a...
Who is this?
You tell him.
Cecil, you didn't blow your trumpet.
Out of my way, mistress.
Speak up, you.
Sir, I realize that this must appear to be a trifle compromising.
- Compromising? En garde, sir.
- If you would allow me to explain...
I will allow you a decent burial and no more.
Will you draw your sword, sir, or shall I run you through?
That's not a very attractive offer.
However, you leave me no choice.
- Now what shall I do?
- Whatever you think best.
But can't you talk to him?
Touché.
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- I, ashamed?
Do you think it's fair to leave a beautiful woman like this alone, neglected...
...while you indulge your own selfish pleasures?
How true.
Grouse hunting?
- When did you last tell her she's beautiful?
- I don't have to, she's my wife.
Wrong. You should remind her of her beauty every day of her life.
Write her poetry. Send her flowers.
- And jewelry.
- Be quiet.
We should never close our eyes to beauty.
If you'd open yours, you'd have not only a wife, but a wife's love.
Sir...
...I give you back your...
Your grouse.
Be careful.
Thank you, but this has become more or less of a habit.
Guards! Guards!
Quickly! Guards!
- Leporello, quick.
- Guards!
- What now?
- Husband.
Horses.
After that man. There!
Over the wall! Hurry! Hurry!
Bring the scoundrel back dead or alive.
And now, mistress, I'll deal with you.
- Yes?
- I...
First, I must tend to my grouse.
- Halt!
- By who's command, fellow?
By command of Her Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth.
- This road is to be kept clear.
- For what reason?
To escort the Spanish duke...
...His Grace the Duke of Córdoba, along this road to London.
What next, you big lout?
How many times must I tell you how much I dislike pomp and ceremony?
- How many times?
- Yes.
- He doesn't like them.
- Your pardon. Are you...?
Merely a simple traveler, captain. No matter.
We'll find another road. Thank you.
If you wish, Your Grace...
- I mean... I mean, sir.
- What's that?
Oh, pay no attention to my fool of a servant, captain.
His brains are addled.
Your Grace, I don't think it fitting that you should ride into London alone.
- You must persuade His Grace.
- Forgive me, Your Grace.
We were told that the duke would arrive at dawn with a full retinue.
Oh, my retinue is close behind me, captain.
Indeed it is, Your Grace.
We'll take you to London instantly and to your bride.
- My bride?
- I know how impatient you must be.
On to London with all haste.
- Your Grace seems to be quite a celebrity.
- Quite.
So keep bowing. Keep smiling.
Imagine, being taken to one's bride by a royal escort.
They're not only royal, they're armed.
Keep bowing. Keep smiling.
I don't like it. I don't like it.
- Courage, Leporello. Courage.
- Courage?
I've gotta sit and wait and worry whether you're coming out headfirst...
...or just your head's coming out.
What are you complaining about?
I'm on my way to marry a woman.
I don't even know what she looks like.
Sit up straight.
No. No, no. I've decided. I won't do it.
I refuse to marry a man I've never seen.
But, Diana, it's all arranged.
It's been arranged for weeks.
The entire court has been invited.
Queen Elizabeth herself is coming to your wedding.
She can afford to.
She's not getting married.
This is treasonous.
What's come over you?
- You haven't been the same since France.
- I wish I'd never returned.
You're as stubborn as your mother, rest her soul.
This alliance may mean peace for England and Spain.
Yes, but not for me.
How do you know?
You've never even seen the duke.
- I have a premonition.
- But...
He's coming! He's coming!
The duke is almost here.
Oh, do come and have a look.
Have a look.
Diana, my child, for my sake.
For England.
Very well. I'll do it for England.
But if he looks like my premonition there still may be war with Spain.
Come, my lady, do have a look.
He's right below. Come along.
Oh, look, that must be His Grace there.
Oh, he's a fine looking gentleman, isn't it?
For a foreigner, that is.
Balcony, 18 feet above street level.
No trellises or vines to hang onto.
Flagpoles won't support your weight.
And if you come out suddenly, come over roof.
Keep horses close.
Well, my lady, what do you think of him?
- I know that head.
- But you couldn't.
- You've never seen the duke.
- No.
But I've seen that head.
Your Grace?
- Your Grace?
- Yes, My Grace.
My son.
My son.
- Father.
- Come.
Your bride awaits you.
Quick, my powder. My brush.
But a moment ago you didn't want to see His Grace.
- That was a moment ago.
- Oh, you're flushed and excited.
- Perhaps you should be put to bed.
- Perhaps.
- Come in, Your Grace. Come in.
- Thank you, sir.
- My daughter will greet you immediately.
- You're very kind, sir.
Diana, my dear.
Oh, Your Grace.
- There's something I should explain, sir.
- But... But...
Diana.
My daughter. My blessed child.
Here is your future husband.
Your Grace.
My compliments, sir.
Indeed, we're both fortunate.
I thank Your Grace.
I thank you.
- Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll...
- By all means.
Oh, Your Grace.
- Well, Your Grace?
- Extremely well.
- Now that I see you for the first time, I...
- The first time?
Well, beauty such as yours is always new.
Charming. Spoken like a Don Juan.
- Don Juan?
- Darling, let's stop pretending.
You're here at last.
- You've found me.
- So I have.
Just as you swore you would that star-crossed night...
...when you held me in your arms.
I'll never forget it.
It was...
- It was...
- Venice.
Venice. Yes, of course.
That unforgettable night.
You and I together.
Strange music coming to us across the water, haunting us.
It was Paris, you beast!
At the home of the Contesse de Trouville in the garden.
You swore you'd remember my kiss till the end of time.
That was four months ago.
Diana, darling, at last I found you.
Liar. Cheat. Imposter.
No. For a moment,
I was blinded by your beauty.
Why do you think I've risked my life to come here posing as the duke?
Well, why? You didn't remember me.
You'd forgotten all about me, hadn't you?
Hadn't you?
Well, call the guards.
Call your father. I deserve it.
This time you won't forget me.
This time I won't let you forget me.
Is that my heart beating so?
No, but that's your father at the door.
- Open the door!
- My lady. My lady.
That man's an imposter.
The duke is here with me.
Yes, father, I'm struggling with him, but he's so strong.
Diana, look...
You scoundrel! You shall pay for this with your head.
Dear lady, forgive me.
You'll come back?
I'm not sure I'll leave.
- Any suggestions, Your Grace?
- Not at the moment.
Have you any suggestions?
No back stairway? No...
Imposter!
Take your hands off my daughter!
Diana, this is the duke.
- This is your future husband.
- And who are you?
Merely a fellow countryman, sir.
Come to congratulate the bride.
- Your name?
- I'm Don Juan.
- Don Juan?
- Don Juan?
- Now, we are ruined.
- Allow me.
You're a disgrace to Spain.
And as a loyal Spaniard
I shall wipe out this disgrace.
- Oh, stop being so... So Spanish.
- Seize that man.
- Oh, let me kill him.
- No! No! No!
No! No! No!
- No! No!
- Diana.
Diana, my dear, no, no, no.
Thank heaven I arrived in time to save you.
But how I could have forgotten anyone as lovely as Diana...
...that's what worries me.
That worries you?
Merciful heavens. At this very moment, they may be sharpening the axes...
...or rigging their gallows, or perhaps both.
- And you're worried about your memory.
- Oh, my dear friend, what will be will be.
A few women I know I've forgotten.
Some I...
I don't even remember well enough to know whether I've forgotten them or not.
But Diana? And after only four months?
I must keep a diary.
Oh, I wouldn't start one now.
It would look ridiculous just to have one entry.
Women, thy name is trouble.
There must be something in life more important than the pursuit of women?
Yes, there must be. But what?
If you would only listen to me.
Here they are.
Don Juan de Maraña...
...you're paroled to the custody of the Spanish ambassador.
Come.
Leporello...
...my cape.
It was with the greatest difficulty...
...I was able to secure your release from an English jail.
But do not imagine this affair is concluded.
Now you seem headed for a Spanish prison.
The Duke de Córdoba has returned to Madrid and laid his grievances before the king.
It's not only an affront to Spanish dignity...
...it's a serious setback to me and my work.
I was able to achieve peace between England and Spain.
This marriage was a step in that direction.
I thought marriage was a step in the opposite direction.
Well, fortunately, there are those who disagree with you.
Queen Elizabeth was interested in this alliance.
Do you think it helps my cause for her to see it destroyed by a Spaniard?
- Perhaps if I talk to her...
- I forbid it.
Your reputation hardly qualifies you as a diplomat.
Yes, of course, my reputation.
Has it ever occurred to Your Excellency, that if a man...
...any average man, makes love to a girl, nobody thinks anything of it.
On the contrary, they all smile indulgently and say what a nice romantic fellow he is.
But if I so much as bow to a lady in the street...
...her relatives start reaching for daggers and wanna carve me up.
- Do you now pretend to be innocent?
- Well, for the things I haven't done, yes.
That still leaves you with a wide margin of guilt.
You were forced to leave St. Petersburg,
Amsterdam, Venice, Paris, Rome.
Columbus extended the world, but for you it grows continually smaller.
Now return to Madrid to present yourself at court for judgment.
- Not Spain...
- That's a command.
Well...
...at least I'll be buried in native soil.
Juan, your father was my friend.
For my sake and for the sake of his memory...
...why don't you give up this wasteful, useless life?
But, Your Excellency...
...I don't consider my life particularly wasteful or useless.
I'm just seeking happiness, the same as any other man.
Our viewpoints differ, that's all.
Yours seems to be higher than mine.
Possibly because you see life mostly from a balcony.
And yet I seem to have heard that when you were young...
We won't discuss that.
Juan, my son, you return to our country at a perilous time.
There are those in Spain as in England who would drive us to war.
Men like that are in every country.
But, unfortunately, those in Spain are shrewd and powerful.
Why, even the king's minister, the Duke de Lorca.
Well, at court, only the queen fights for peace.
Now, you have grace and wit and daring.
If you'd use these attributes in our cause...
Oh, Your Excellency, I'm not fitted for a life of court intrigue.
I wouldn't know what to do.
Besides, Her Majesty's hardly likely to seek my head.
- I'm returning in disgrace to be punished.
- As you deserve to be.
But you could be useful to us.
If one day I should call upon you, would you?
For you, my dear friend? Anything.
I've written to Queen Margaret urging she deal gently with you.
And, heaven forgive me, stating faith in your reformation.
If heaven will help, I'll try, if only to keep faith with you.
Do so. Her Majesty rewards those who serve her.
She gave me this ring as a seal of our friendship.
She needs friends.
Be loyal to her...
...and you'll find her as I have, a generous and just ruler.
- Thank you, sir.
- Remember your promise.
- I will. I'll set an example for all Spain.
- Heaven forbid.
- Adios.
- Adios.
Oh, don't you think I should make my apologies to Lady Diana?
Off with you!
What's happened here?
This is not the Madrid I once knew.
No life. No laughter.
That will all be changed now that you're back.
Thank you.
Couldn't we get something to eat?
Welcome, señores.
Welcome to the finest inn in all Madrid.
- How do you know it's the finest?
- Must be.
All the others have been taxed out of existence.
- May I be of service, señores?
- Indeed you may.
- Food and wine, if you please.
- This way, please.
The best in the house.
I must apologize, señores.
These days the best we have is only humble fare.
What? This from a man who's always served the best food in all Spain.
- In all Europe.
- Oh, thank you, señores.
My wife and I we shall do our best to please you.
Maria, we have guests.
You don't know this place.
A few lies can sometimes make a man feel happy.
Excuse me, señor, is there anything I can bring you?
Señorita, you've already brought me what I want.
Proof again that in all the world the most beautiful...
- No thanks.
- Michaela.
- I will serve the gentlemen.
- Yes, Mother.
Forgive me, señor, we mothers can't be too careful.
Don Juan is about to return to Madrid.
This fellow bring the black plague with him?
Worse than that, he brings himself.
You know his reputation.
- I shudder with fear.
- Oh, and I with anticipation.
Hussy! Get about your work.
Soup, señores.
Father, the Duke de Lorca's men.
A proclamation. Give heed.
"By order of the king's minister, the Duke de Lorca, we call on all men...
...with stout hearts and willing hands to join with us for the glory of Spain...
...in volunteering for service with the Spanish fleet.
Adventure and gold for all."
Any volunteers?
You, you will volunteer. Take him along.
- No, Father, no.
- No, he's my son. You have no right.
- Quiet, old man, or we'll take you too.
- You can't.
We are free men.
Take him out.
What is this disturbance?
Can't you see I'm having my meal?
You shall have a carving lesson to go with it, señor.
He's in there.
Señor! Señor!
Oh, bless you, señor.
- What happened?
- Oh, it was a press gang.
And they tried to take my son and me for the fleet. This gentleman saved us.
Oh, it is nothing.
Once in St. Petersburg, we were set up...
What are you boasting about?
You think it's a pleasure...
...to come home after 10 years and find myself in a brawl?
Your favor, good people. Now, perhaps, we can finish our meal in peace.
What...? What is your master's name so I may thank him properly?
Don Juan de Maraña.
- Don Juan?
- Did you hear?
Don Juan? Don Juan!
He's come back!
Michaela, what are you waiting for?
Serve Don Juan at once.
More wine, señor.
Please. You've had so many adventures.
Señores, señoritas.
These stories you've been hearing, they're mere legends. Old wives' tales.
We've only heard about young wives.
Is it true that you swam the Bosphorus to visit the caliph's daughter?
Certainly, my dear.
We'd sank the whole Turkish fleet on the way.
- Is it true?
- Why, of course, it's true.
It's all true.
But what we crave is news of Spain.
Yes, of our own country.
What of the court, for instance, and the new king and queen? What?
I thought we're among friends.
Well, señor, the queen works for the welfare of Spain.
- And the king?
- The king does not work at all.
Pacheco, how much longer must we straddle this contraption?
Yes, how much longer?
But, Your Majesty, I've just begun.
You have just begun.
But His Majesty has been straddling for years.
Be quiet, Sebastian.
If Your Majesty will be patient for just a few moments more.
- Oh, very well.
- Oh, very well.
- Your Majesty.
- Yes?
The Duke de Lorca seeks private audience with Your Majesty.
Oh, have him come in.
Diego, help Sebastian.
The things we do for posterity.
Yes, the things we do for posterity.
Sorry, Pacheco, affairs of state.
I understand, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Gentlemen, come in. Come in.
Lorca. Rodrigo.
Well, how do you like our portrait?
A perfect likeness, sire.
The artist has proven himself worthy of the subject.
- Hear that, Pacheco?
- It is high praise indeed, Your Majesty.
Yes, it is. It is.
We'll continue this another time.
Gentlemen, we wish to see the duke alone.
Run along, Sebastian.
Sire, be sure to lock up the paints and brushes.
- Why, monkey?
- Because His Grace is not in the picture.
And he'll try to rectify that.
He goes too far.
- One day, I shall send him further.
- Come, come, gentlemen.
He says even worse things about me.
Now, what do you want of us?
We have received news that the English queen...
...refuses to sign our treaty of peace.
- What's that?
She demands further guarantees and concessions.
- But we've already given her our word.
- Exactly.
She has seen fit to doubt the word of the king of Spain.
This is a serious matter.
What do you suggest?
What I have constantly suggested:
We prepare ourselves as they do.
Then strike first and strike suddenly.
- But isn't this rather drastic?
- Drastic, sire?
At this moment the English are building ships and arming them.
Suppose they attack first and we are defenseless, what then?
It does present a problem.
It's all very well to talk about war, but where's the money coming from?
I will see to that, Your Majesty.
With your help, of course.
There are taxes to be collected and levies to be imposed.
- This document will help solve the problem.
- What is it?
An order for the recall of our ambassador to England.
Recall de Polan? But on what grounds?
The New World is our colony, sire, and consequently...
...all profit from New World merchandise should be ours too.
Instead, it is being paid to the count and held by him.
- By who's authority?
- By yours, sire.
The queen persuaded you to sign a paper to that effect.
Someone's always getting me to sign papers.
- I'll not do it anymore.
- It'll be to your advantage to sign this one.
- But I can't. De Polan is our friend.
- The queen's friend, sire.
Well, why not write him and ask him for the money?
He refuses to turn it over to us.
He and the queen are using it to promote trade between England and Spain.
Sire, with this money we could build a great and invulnerable navy. An armada.
Yes, but the last time we built an armada, the confounded English sank it.
Last time, every Englishman from the chimney sweep...
...to Sir Francis Drake knew our armada and were prepared.
This time we'll build in secret.
Even the queen need know nothing of this until de Polan turns the money over.
- Yes, but...
- Sire, without ships we are powerless.
A second-rate nation.
But with ships...
...our arms will sweep over England,
Africa, Eurasia...
...over the New World and thence to Cathay and the East Indies.
This is the destiny of Spain.
Your destiny.
To carve out an empire and be proclaimed an emperor greater even than Charlemagne.
Charlemagne?
Yes. Yes.
In years to come your people will bless you for this.
Well, here's for the people.
Her Majesty, Queen Margaret.
Your Majesty.
How now, Margaret?
Your Majesty granted several audiences.
They await us.
Oh, audiences are such a bore.
Always people wanting something.
They're not important to you but they've been promised.
But I'll have to go through all that discomfort.
And I've had a very difficult morning.
Oh, you haven't commented on my portrait.
- Most regal, sire. Truly a king.
- Everyone seems to think so.
I'll have Pacheco make a copy for you.
A smaller one to put in your apartment.
I will cherish it. Perhaps it may reveal some of the secrets you keep from me.
- We have no secrets, have we, Lorca?
- Our policy is an open book, Your Majesty.
Written by Your Grace and dedicated to war.
Your Majesty mistakes my motives.
You've come but recently from your father's court in Austria...
...and cannot therefore understand as we do the problems of Spain.
I was under the impression that the desire to make people happy knew no boundaries.
There, there, my dear.
You mustn't worry about such matters.
Besides, the audiences are waiting.
If you will proceed, we will join you as soon as we can.
As you say, sire.
Odd, isn't it, Lorca...
...that Her Majesty always makes me feel as though I was Sebastian's size?
Now, I don't feel that way with you.
Señor, I'm ordered to present myself before Their Majesties.
Don Juan de Maraña.
Escort this gentleman to the antechamber of the throne room...
...and submit this letter to Her Majesty.
Don Juan de Maraña?
This way, please.
Don Juan de Maraña.
Your Majesty.
You may rise, señor.
No man has ever approached this throne with such advance notice.
We have received letters concerning you from our ambassadors all over Europe.
It is with slight regard...
...and very little favor that your queen receives you on your return to Spain.
You come back to us notorious, of ill repute...
...disgraced in your own country and abroad.
You are no credit to this crown or to our flag.
Have you nothing to say?
There seems to be very little left to say,
Your Majesty.
You are quite right.
Do you realize that you destroyed our plans for an important marriage of state?
That marriage, Your Majesty, was doomed from the beginning.
Those two didn't even know each other, let alone love each other.
Business arrangements can be made that way, but love...
Your views on love are quite well-known, señor.
We are not interested.
However, the Count de Polan seems to have faith in your promises of reformation.
He must have reasons for pleading so poor a cause.
Perhaps you can enlighten us?
I thought myself the count was inclined to be overoptimistic, Your Majesty.
Being an old family friend...
...he seems to find qualities in me that may not exist.
However,
I'd sincerely like to justify his faith.
Perhaps even gain yours.
Our faith is gained by deeds not by words.
His Majesty, the king.
Well, well. And whom have we here?
This is Don Juan de Maraña,
Your Majesty.
Don Juan, huh? Bad boy.
So this is the great Don Juan.
Not knowing who you are, señor,
I'm unable to return the compliment.
Oh, this is our minister, the Duke de Lorca.
- Yes. I've heard much of Your Grace.
- And I of you.
Tell me, do you hire men to spread the tales of your romantic conquests?
No, Your Excellency, that's a service...
...that's always been done for me free of charge.
You have a ready tongue. It's a pity it's been used in such idle pursuits.
A matter of opinion, Your Grace.
Some men prefer the conquest of beauty to the conquest of a throne.
You may proceed, Margaret.
Our ambassadors asked us to find service for Don Juan at our court.
If it pleases, Your Majesty.
Yes. Yes, why not?
For what work are you qualified?
Work, Your Majesty?
That's a problem that's often troubled me.
Let's see.
I have a small knowledge of history...
...and a little skill with the sword.
Perhaps I may even lead a press gang...
...such as I interrupted yesterday on its royal errand.
You will explain your statement.
When I arrived in Madrid...
...my first encounter was with a detachment of the Duke de Lorca's men.
They were abducting by force...
...Your Majesty's subjects for service in the Royal Navy.
Well, there must be some mistake.
Do you know anything about this, Lorca?
The whole matter is easily explained,
Your Majesty.
This Don Juan returns to Spain in disgrace...
...to hear the crown's sentence for his conduct abroad.
What could be easier than to distract with a story of press gangs?
Yes. Yes, that must be it.
I assure Your Majesty the affair took place as I described it.
I will tell you what took place.
Some affair was reported to me.
A brawl with a drunken sergeant for the affection of an innkeeper's daughter.
The sergeant is reflecting on a diet of bread and water.
Your Majesty should consider the merits of the sentence for the other party involved.
And now, have I Your Majesty's permission to withdraw?
There are more important matters to consider...
...than the settlement of a drunken brawl.
I must go too.
Pacheco's waiting.
He has to fill in my head.
Your Majesty, much has been said of me.
A great deal of it true.
Even my enemies know
I'd not invent any such lie...
...merely to evade the consequences of my actions.
I shall investigate this affair.
In the meantime, there's a question of suitable service for you.
- I'm yours to command, Your Majesty.
- Very well.
You will become fencing instructor at the Royal Academy.
And confine your instruction to this alone.
You will report to the master-at-arms,
Don Serafino Lopez.
That is our command.
It will be obeyed, Your Majesty.
And may I add my own humble thanks for your generosity.
You may go now, señor.
- Your Grace.
- Come in, Rodrigo. Come in.
The Count de Polan crossed the frontier into Spain this morning.
He drives on to Madrid.
- Alone?
- He has attendants. A handful.
Hardly a sufficient escort for such a notable visitor.
A larger party has been dispatched under Capitán Alvarez.
Splendid. We must see that the Count de Polan receives every courtesy.
- Capitán Alvarez has his orders, Your Grace.
- Good.
Remember, every courtesy.
Yes, Your Grace.
Capitán Alvarez.
On to the fortress!
You must forgive my haste in bringing you back, my dear count.
But it was most urgent.
The urgency of your personal ambition.
You put it bluntly but with a certain degree of accuracy.
Fortunately, my ambition coincides with that of Spain...
...for a Spanish empire.
To be built out of the suffering of our people and to be ruled by you.
The building of an empire entails certain sacrifices.
As for me, I have no desire to sit upon a throne.
- I much prefer to stand behind it.
- With a dagger in your hand.
No, I dislike violence.
I find persuasion far more effective.
And now, if I can persuade you to answer one question...?
You may ask it.
A purely material consideration.
A matter of several millions paid into your hand.
If you tell me where you've concealed this money...
It will be turned over to Spain at the proper time.
For the purpose of this transaction,
I am Spain.
I prefer to deal with Her Majesty not with a traitor.
My dear friend, I'm afraid your long stay in a country ruled by a king in petticoats...
...has made you a feminist.
- When Her Majesty hears...
It may interest you that the palace guards are loyal to me and not to the queen.
I have arranged this so that if Her Majesty interferes with my plans again...
Or rather, with the plans of Spain.
- She will suffer the consequences.
Now will you answer my question?
As you can see we have several interesting devices in this chamber.
They have a tendency to break a man's will.
If the first one fails, we try another...
...until we find exactly the right one to loosen the tongue.
I have heard of men whose tongues have withstood it.
Yes, but they now speak with the tongues of angels.
You're tired after your long trip.
Perhaps a few days' rest will make you more amenable.
If not, well...
Capitán Alvarez, the count will remain here as our guest.
See to it that he is not disturbed by anyone.
And now, my dear count...
...may I wish you good night and pleasant dreams.
If you change your mind, send for me.
What's this?
- Very nice.
- No. No.
That's a gift from Her Majesty.
It will look better on me than on a corpse.
Very nice.
- Excuse me.
- That's the second time.
That's enough. Give me that.
You think I want my throat cut?
Sorry. I seem to be a bit nervous.
These regular hours we're keeping.
Hard work, lots of sleep, plenty of exercise...
...good nourishing food and no excitement.
We're not used to these things.
Yes, but that's the only way of life for me.
But you'll have to admit that they were exciting days.
- And nights.
- Exciting?
That's very funny coming from you.
Remember those lectures you used to give me?
Well, I'm afraid I'm a bit confused.
The sudden way in which you reformed...
...one reception at court.
The court didn't do it.
Well, I thought maybe the queen...
The queen?
What's the queen got to do with it?
You've been thinking behind my back.
Because I'm trying to lead a good clean sensible life...
...you immediately jump to conclusions.
Just let me tell you this.
Whatever my behavior has been or it's gonna be...
...the queen has nothing to do with it.
Absolutely nothing. Do you understand?
All right.
- Splendid. Splendid.
- Splendid. Splendid.
Half turn right. Forward march.
You may rise, gentlemen.
- A splendid exhibition, Don Serafino.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
They show remarkable improvement.
We are deeply gratified.
Your Majesty's most kind.
But may I share the credit with Don Juan?
Since he had joined us...
...the interest in swordsmanship has increased enormously.
We trust he will not add any other subjects to increase the interest.
May I inquire if Her Majesty is also satisfied?
We are indeed.
You apparently studied all the foreign techniques of swordsmanship.
I've had occasion to use them,
Your Grace.
I have not met such skilled an opponent...
...since I have the honor of fencing with the Duke de Lorca himself.
That is indeed a compliment.
We consider Lorca the best living fencer in Spain.
That's certainly the mark of a good duelist,
Your Majesty, to be living.
I wish I knew how to duel.
Whom would you choose for your opponent?
A mouse. Caterpillar.
Or perhaps His Grace.
I'd considered it an honor to teach you, sir.
- You will?
- Certainly.
- Go and get equipped for tomorrow's class.
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go at once.
- Do you really think I can learn?
- Why not? Of course, you can.
That was very kind of you.
You've made a friend.
I can use friends, Your Majesty.
You show such interest in the academy.
Perhaps you'd like to inspect it thoroughly?
Don Juan, would you escort Her Majesty?
Indeed, sire. An honor.
You know, Lorca, we might find a use for this Don Juan.
Yes, sir, Your Majesty.
My own thoughts were along similar lines.
This, Your Majesty, is our trophy room.
Here, you see some of the personal flags...
...of such conquerors as Cortéz,
Columbus, Pizarro.
Over there are some of the flags taken from Your Majesty's enemies in battle.
Oran, Tripoli.
And that empty space awaits new conquests by Your Majesties.
Unless it can be filled with the trophies of peace...
...I would rather it remained empty.
I knew you'd say that.
Oh, the Count de Polan...
...he's told me something of your feelings.
- Have you heard from him recently?
- No, I haven't.
Nor have I. It is strange that he should keep silent so long.
Yes. He was far from silent at our last meeting.
I can well believe that.
However, I shall write and tell him how you have changed.
- I know he'd be pleased. As I am.
- I'm very grateful.
Now, perhaps I can forget those words you once spoke to me:
"You're no credit to this crown or to our flag."
Did I say that?
That was just a small part.
Would you care to hear the rest?
No. I give you permission to forget all of it.
I know this flag.
When I was a child in Austria...
...my mother used to tell me the story of Ponce de León...
...and his quest for the Fountain of Youth.
Thank heavens he never found it.
Wouldn't you like to retain your youth?
What? And repeat all my indiscretions?
I think you paint yourself far blacker than you are.
It's the color that's said to suit me best.
- I don't believe that.
- Thank you.
I shall try to prove myself worthy of your disbelief.
Perhaps you will.
Your Majesty.
The Count de Polan asked me to be loyal to you.
To try to win your friendship.
And will you be loyal?
With all my heart.
Then I shall be your friend.
I...
I mustn't keep His Majesty waiting.
I'm summoned to appear before the Duke de Lorca.
Oh, yes.
Don Juan de Maraña to see the Duke de Lorca.
Don Juan de Maraña.
Ask him to come in.
Don Juan.
Your Grace.
- You sent for me, I believe.
- Yes.
Yes, a matter of some importance
I wish to discuss with you.
Now, won't you be seated?
I was greatly pleased by the exhibition yesterday.
So pleased, in fact, that I feel you should be rewarded.
I've prepared a commission, which will give you considerable rank in His Majesty's navy.
It also assures you of the king's favor and my own.
Somehow I feel that Your Grace is not in the habit of dispensing favors...
...without expecting something in return.
You are quite right. Yes.
You have achieved some popularity since you have been at the academy.
And I think we should utilize this in the service of our country.
Consequently, I have certain ideas that I should like you to carry out.
- May I hear them?
- You may indeed.
Proceed to enlarge the academy.
Increase the number of young men of military age and add those subjects...
...which will qualify them for immediate enlistment in His Majesty's navy.
We will discuss the details later.
In the meantime, here is your commission.
Incidentally, I was very impressed by your general technique yesterday.
Very good.
Very good, yes.
It was quite good.
Well?
It seems to me
Your Grace is preparing for war.
- Does the idea frighten you?
- Frankly, it does.
I'm by nature a peaceful man,
Your Grace.
It's true I've done some fighting in my time...
...but it's usually for something worthwhile...
...like a beautiful woman.
To risk your skin for a piece of extra ground, that's terrifying.
I take it then you do not look with favor upon my proposals?
That, Your Grace, is an understatement.
In my opinion, your personal ambitions...
...can only lead our country to complete disaster.
I wasn't aware that I asked for your opinion.
May I remind you, my dear fellow, that in a conflict, one must choose a side.
The middle ground is frequently the most dangerous.
I've been in the middle so many times,
Your Grace, it doesn't disturb me.
I see you prefer to be witty rather than wise.
Not at all.
I prefer to be on the side of the friends of Spain, not her enemies.
Next time, I may cut deeper.
Next time...
Next time, I'll wear my old clothes.
Your Excellency.
- What's happened, Your Grace?
- Never mind, give me that.
- What news of the Count de Polan?
- He still refuses to speak.
Very well.
We shall wait no longer.
Take him to the torture chamber.
Yes, Your Grace.
We are pleased to have you with us,
Count D'Orsini.
We hope to see more of you and your bride before your return to Italy.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
And I'm sure that the people of my country will welcome this alliance.
And now, we must not keep you any longer.
You are very kind, Your Majesty.
And I am deeply grateful for this reception.
Your Majesty, I had a difficult time getting him here.
I had to force him.
- You may leave us, Sebastian.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Would you care to take a walk with me in the garden?
With Your Majesty's permission.
I believe congratulations are in order,
Don Juan.
A royal commission is a great honor.
You should be very proud.
I suppose I should, Your Majesty.
But I rejected the commission.
I don't understand.
It would have meant so much to you.
Yes, I suppose so.
But I've always looked upon the academy as a school for the art of defense.
- Not aggression.
- Oh, I agree.
- I heard of the Duke's plan last evening.
- Surely not from him?
The palace has large keyholes.
My informer has small ears.
I detest this intrigue, but Lorca has his spies so I must have mine.
Spies are not enough, Your Majesty.
I assure you, you need constant protection.
Someone you can trust who will watch over you.
Don't you think you make too much of my danger?
Well, when it concerns
Your Majesty's welfare...
...perhaps I am overcautious.
May I suggest you be equally cautious concerning yourself?
If you have made an enemy of the Duke, that is unwise.
Yes, I'm well aware of that, Your Majesty.
As a matter of fact, it's already cost me my best jacket.
Hot-tempered, isn't he?
However, I'll make friends and choose enemies to please myself...
...not the Duke de Lorca.
I wish there were more men in Spain with the courage to defy His Grace.
I'm glad you came back.
So am I.
Look.
These materials have just arrived from Holland.
- Aren't they lovely?
- Beautiful.
- You've been to Holland, haven't you?
- Briefly.
I always wanted to travel. I envy you.
Tell me, Don Juan, don't you miss the life you once led?
Well, I meant it must have been so interesting.
And you have changed so completely.
Yes, it's been quite a surprise to me too,
Your Majesty.
Perhaps it's because
I found something I always wanted.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
A purpose in life, your work.
My work's quite congenial, but hardly that inspiring.
What is it then? Please be seated.
Tell me.
Shall I command you?
- If you command me, then I must obey.
- I do command you.
It's not easy to tell.
Like most other men...
...there's always been an imaginary woman in my life.
I endowed her with all the virtues.
I clothed her in perfection.
Naturally, I searched for her in vain.
I thought she could never exist except in my mind.
Now I find she does.
Who is this woman?
You choose to keep her a secret?
Only because she doesn't know how deeply I care for her.
Well, you never hesitate to express your love to other women.
She's not like other women.
Well-spoken.
- What is she like?
- Beautiful.
But strangely unaware of her beauty.
Passionate, too, but without any real knowledge of passion.
Unafraid of love because
I don't think she's ever known love.
But she's taught me virtue and dignity and wisdom.
You seem to have chosen a paragon among women.
Among women and among queens.
Have you forgotten to whom you are speaking?
No. Some men shut their eyes and dream, others open their eyes and hope.
All my life I have been stumbling around as if in darkness. I am no longer.
Silence.
You have no right to speak to me that way.
I forbid you.
I would never have spoken except by your command.
Then I was wrong to command you.
Wrong to think that you could ever reform...
...or to believe that friendship and loyalty could replace your desire for conquest.
- That's not true.
- You may go, señor.
Yes, Your Majesty.
So? Don Juan?
Again.
- Correct?
- Excellent.
Now me.
Arm extended.
- What was that?
- My new side step.
Let me see it.
Don't ever sidestep the wrong way.
Continue.
No, no, no. What are you trying to do, club the man to death?
This, my friend, is a rapier, not an axe.
Now, watch.
All right, en garde.
Now, beat, extend and lunge.
Thus, you see?
Isn't he charming?
Serafino, can nothing be done about these gaping, ogling visitors?
Of course, in the past nobody came but an occasional old soldier. Now...
Now we have a whole flock of chattering females.
Look at them up there, looks like a hen roost.
Yes, this feminine interest is surprising.
Personally, I've had enough feminine interest for the day.
If you don't mind.
That will be all. Class dismissed.
Really.
Juan, what is the matter with you today?
Why, nothing. Nothing at all.
It's just a little ironic.
A man gives up everything. A rich, full life.
First time he tries to be sincere, what happens?
- Exactly what I'm trying to find out.
- Well, mind your own business. You too.
Excuse me, señor.
Has my brother finished with his lesson?
- Your brother, señorita?
- Yes.
Do you happen to recall his name?
- Of course, Carlos.
- Carlos?
Everyone is finished, señorita, so no doubt Carlos is finished too.
Oh, I didn't understand.
- I call for him every day.
- Yes, I know.
Well, I don't like to have him walk home alone.
He's so young and helpless.
Well, that's very sisterly of you.
Besides, it's quite a distance from here.
All the way to the Plaza Madrid.
The Plaza Madrid?
- The last house.
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, on the right.
- Oh, on the right?
Elena.
Are you here again?
- Carlos, run along, dear.
- Bye, Don Juan.
Good day, señor.
- Señorita, your fan.
- Oh, yes.
You will return it to me, won't you?
Getting warm.
It will get warmer.
Listen.
Every evening that nightingale sings here.
- How sad and sweet his song is.
- Yes.
And my heart sings with him sweetly because you're by my side.
And my heart is very sad, for soon you must go.
- And tomorrow...
- Tomorrow?
Tomorrow, I shall fence very badly...
...because my eyes will be drawn to the platform where you are.
No, I won't be there tomorrow.
- Oh, you won't?
- No, I'll never be there again.
- Oh, my darling, we'll be together all the...
- No, I'm getting married tomorrow.
You must think it capricious of me to be with you the night before my wedding.
- Capri...? No, no, not at all, not at all.
- You don't?
Well, perhaps...
Perhaps just the least little bit.
I did it so I could remember for all the years of my life...
...this evening here in the garden with Don Juan.
Well, I'm delighted to have been of service.
I don't want to marry Count D'Orsini.
- The Queen arranged it.
- The Queen?
Yes, she did it to strengthen the alliance between Spain and his country.
History repeats itself.
Oh, nothing.
That's why we must never see each other again.
Never.
Never, never.
I know you'll forgive my hasty departure.
Prolonged sentimental farewells are too painful.
Good night, beloved. No, no, no, don't.
I want to remember you just as you are.
No, no, it's easier this way, farewell.
- Good evening, señor.
- Evening.
Count D'Orsini.
Well, good evening.
You'll not get away so easily, señor.
You're caught.
The story of my life.
Señor, this may possibly sound a little trite, but I can explain everything.
I happen to be the fencing instructor of the Countess Elena's brother and...
Would you believe I came here to give him a lesson?
- At this hour?
- What time is it?
Well, you know what they say, never too late to learn.
He's telling you the truth.
If it is the truth, then he should be prepared to die for it.
Come, Señor Fencing Instructor.
You'll give me a lesson. En garde.
My dear count, can't we possibly settle this some other way?
I'm warning you, señor, draw your blade.
Would you be satisfied with an apology?
My dear count, we have no argument.
The lady is yours.
Their Majesties shall hear of this.
It is shocking. Unbelievable.
Once again, he's provoked a serious scandal and disrupted an important alliance.
The very same sort of conduct...
...which brought him back to Spain in disgrace.
It is disillusioning, Your Majesty.
This time I will know how to deal with him.
He shall be punished, and most severely.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, but surely you intend to give him a chance to explain?
- There's no explanation possible.
- But perhaps it wasn't his fault.
I mean, I was at the academy yesterday afternoon...
...and I saw certain things.
- What things? What are you talking about?
- Something was disturbing Don Juan.
- He was irritable and upset and...
- Yes, well?
Well, he certainly wasn't interested in any of the young ladies present.
- But the Countess Elena began to...
- Well, go on.
Well, she began to make advances.
- You know, she's young and charming...
- Well, what happened?
Well, I do not wish to malign the countess, but she practically...
Well, you know, a man has just so much control.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Is this true? Are you lying to protect him?
Your Majesty...
Margaret, we have just heard about your friend Don Juan...
...and we're most distressed.
- I understand, sire.
Our court is not to become a playground for wastrels.
Nor will we allow our guests to be humiliated by any of our subjects.
We have decided once and for all to be rid of this fellow.
He is to leave Spain and never return.
Yes, but, sire, to be banned forever, that's worse than a sentence of death.
That, too, was considered, Your Majesty.
But to kill Don Juan would make a martyr of him...
...and we would not care to enhance his already legendary reputation.
- Sire, I beg you to reconsider.
- The matter is closed.
We have ordered Don Juan put on the first ship bound for the New World.
That is our judgment.
- Your Majesties.
- Well, well?
Your Majesty, Don Juan has disappeared.
We can find no trace of him anywhere.
You blundering idiots.
Warn the guards at the city gates.
Search every house and street in Madrid until you find him.
With Your Majesty's permission, of course.
Yes, yes, by all means find him.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Thank you, señor.
- All arrangements made?
- Yes, but to what purpose?
We'll never get out of Spain alive.
The roads are watched, frontier guarded.
This inn is filled with soldiers hunting for you.
Let them look.
Señor, Lorca's men are everywhere.
I pray you'll be careful.
- Oh, you may as well argue with a stone.
- The wagon will be ready soon.
- It will take you to the frontier.
- Innkeeper.
- Innkeeper.
- Watch yourself.
Innkeeper.
- Yes, capitán?
- Innkeeper, I need money and more wine.
- Sell you this ring cheap. A bargain.
- It's not necessary, capitán.
If you will come with me...
- Perhaps you will buy this ring, señor?
- No, capitán.
- Only a few ducats.
- Capitán, please.
And what about you, señor?
It's beautiful.
- Thank you, no.
- Please...
Genuine heirloom.
See the workmanship, eh?
- Please, capitán, come with me.
- And cheap.
Michaela, more wine for our friend.
Juan, I beg you to consider.
- It's madness to try and escape.
- It's madness to stay.
I must leave Spain.
Very well, we'll go.
No. Not you.
I'd not ask you to share with me what lies ahead.
I go alone.
Do you think I'd let you go roaming about the universe without me?
- I'm going with you.
- And if I order you to stay?
Then I shall disobey.
Everything is ready, señor.
Be on guard.
There will be trouble awaiting you.
I'm accustomed to trouble.
Fortunately, I'm a coward.
That will balance the situation.
Thank you.
See the stones, the workmanship.
- Would you gentlemen care to buy a ring?
- Not interested.
Not interested, huh?
Well, you're the loser. It's beautiful ring.
Marvelous workmanship. It's magnificent.
- What is it? What is it?
- That ring.
- It belongs to the Count de Polan.
- But the count's in England.
Go in and ask the captain if he'd be kind enough to have a word with me.
- Excuse me, capitán?
- Well, what is it?
My friend is interested in your ring.
- Would you mind stepping outside?
- Very well.
- Well, where is he?
- Please.
- Very valuable ring.
- Very.
I wonder, captain...
...if you'd be kind enough to tell me how you came by this ring?
- I don't remember.
- Oh, you don't?
Perhaps a little wind in your gullet might refresh your memory.
- Speak up.
- Took it from a prisoner in the fortress.
- The Count de Polan, wasn't it?
- No.
The truth, or on my soul I'll drive this steel right through your neck.
- Speak up.
- Yeah, it was the count.
How came he there? By whose order?
The Duke de Lorca.
This is the final insult.
The Count D'Orsini has left Madrid.
Our relations with a friendly government have been impaired.
And Don Juan has disappeared.
Completely vanished.
- Is there no sign of him?
- None.
But don't worry, frontier guards have been alerted.
And this time we'll have his head.
This time...
Your Majesty.
- Well, what is it?
- Don Juan de Maraña is here.
He begs audience with Her Majesty.
- Don Juan?
- Yes, sire. He has surrendered.
But he says it's most urgent that he speak with Her Majesty.
Send him in.
Your Majesties.
- Don Juan.
- You may approach, señor.
Well, what do you want of us?
I bare grave tidings, Your Majesties.
- What happened, Rodrigo?
- Don Juan's in the palace.
- He's found out about the Count de Polan.
- What?
- Phillip?
- But Lorca wouldn't do such thing...
...without our consent. I mean...
- Your Majesty...
...this, I think, should be sufficient proof.
Yes, it is true.
This is a ring I once gave him.
We must go to the fortress at once.
But, my dear, we mustn't be so hasty.
Your Majesties, I beg you not to delay.
I fear for the count's life.
He's right. Phillip, please.
Oh, very well.
There's no need for all this.
Lorca, you're the very one we wanted to speak to.
Seize that man.
If he resists, put an end to him.
Stop this. Stop this at once.
Put up your swords.
What is the meaning of this?
- Take him to the fortress.
- Just a moment.
- When do you give orders in our presence?
- We live in a changing world, sire.
Even as we stand here, the command of the palace shifts from Your Majesty to me.
As for you, Don Juan...
...your sentence of exile will be changed to a sentence of death.
- This is treason.
- You will never succeed in this.
The people will rise against you.
Shepherds may change, but sheep remain sheep.
And now, Your Majesty,
I must ask you to retire.
I have private business
I wish to transact with the king.
Escort Her Majesty to her apartment.
And see that she's well protected against any intrusion.
- And now, sire.
- What do you intend doing with us?
Your Majesty will continue to rule with certain guidance and direction...
...and without the interference of the queen.
- You will not harm her?
- Not if it can be avoided.
I will give her her choice.
Either the position of an obedient wife, or the fate of a meddling woman.
And now, if you'll excuse me...
Your Majesty.
All right, open.
Yes, capitán.
Well, well, my friend, how things change.
I trust you're comfortable?
What's the matter, can't you speak?
You were quite talkative last night.
So were you, with a blade at your throat.
I hope you retain your sense of humor when there's a rope around yours.
Oh, incidentally, you were curious about the Count de Polan.
Oh, mercy...
Your Excellency?
Don Jose?
It's me.
Don Juan, Juan. Juan de Maraña.
Don Juan?
Speak up, old man.
Or do you need more persuasion?
Don't. No.
- In which cell is Don Juan?
- What do you wish of him, Padre?
We have come to give him the last rites.
Juan?
Don Juan?
Juan.
Don Juan.
Count Seraf...?
Leporello.
Guard? Guard?
The blessing has been given.
This way.
Have you seen the turnkey, Padre?
I think you will find him in the first cell.
No...
Mercy.
You can hardly expect us to be merciful, my dear count...
...while you remain so stubborn.
The Duke de Lorca's growing impatient.
Speak up, old man, or do you need more persuasion?
Again.
No.
Don Juan, here.
Hurry.
This way, here.
You've been summoned here tonight...
...because as students at the Royal Academy...
...I know your loyalty to the king and queen.
I also know that you'll be the first to suffer unless the Duke de Lorca is defeated.
There's only one way he can be beaten.
By arousing the people.
You know well that his men are everywhere.
The streets are filled with them.
So we must go about our business with the utmost secrecy.
First, we must...
- You can't go in here.
- How do you get in there?
Don Juan.
Go.
- Sebastian?
- Thank heaven I found you.
- What brings you? Is the queen all right?
- At the moment.
Since news of your escape reached the palace, Lorca's become desperate.
There's no telling what he might do.
You must get the queen out of the palace tonight.
- Her life is in danger.
- There aren't enough of us.
- Now, perhaps by tomorrow...
- No, tomorrow will be too late.
Tonight will be too soon.
We couldn't even get through the gates.
Do you know a way in?
At the far end of the palace grounds there is an opening in the garden wall.
And if you're careful, you can get in the same way I got out.
You will forgive this intrusion,
Your Majesty...
...but events move rapidly and we are pressed for time.
We asked the king to sign a document...
...declaring our country in a state of siege and granting us full power.
This is agreeable to His Majesty.
But he informs me that you are unwilling to cooperate in our plans for Spain.
- Is that correct?
- It is.
Does Your Majesty realize the consequence of such a refusal?
We do, indeed, Your Grace.
But rather than deliver our people into your hands, we would prefer to die.
If Your Majesty would only face reality...
We can face reality, but not treachery.
Nor will we bargain with a traitor.
We are well aware of your intentions,
Your Grace.
We shall never accede to such a request.
Then Your Majesty clears my conscience by signing her own death warrant.
Will you come with us peacefully?
Guards?
Come.
I'm looking for Her Majesty.
Do you know where I can find her?
- Her Majesty is in the chapel.
- In the chapel?
Then I better not disturb her.
- How do we get to the chapel?
- Down this corridor.
But it's all the way on the other side of the palace.
Guards, guards, guards, guar...!
Hey.
Don Juan, quickly.
They're taking the queen to the fortress.
Leporello, Serafino.
Fire guards, fire guards, call the fire guards!
Don Juan?
Rodrigo.
I warned you, señor.
This time I shall cut deeply.
This time I'm wearing my old clothes.
The sword is not for a traitor.
You die by the knife.
Your Majesties.
Your Majesty.
I had to see you.
I could stay away no longer.
Is it true that you are leaving?
- Tomorrow.
- But why?
Why do you have to leave Madrid now?
- You've become a hero of the people.
- Have I?
Then it must be easy to become a hero.
But for a man to be leaving the woman he truly loves...
...the woman he can never have, that's not easy.
But if you stay?
If I stay, it can only bring unhappiness to both of us.
I know that now. You must know it too.
Where will you go?
Who knows?
Into oblivion, I suppose, where most legends go.
No, there can be no oblivion for you.
Where you go, life follows.
Before you came back, Madrid was dead.
Now there's a heartbeat.
My heartbeat.
Juan, take me with you.
Strange.
Once to have heard those words would have brought me complete happiness.
Now they bring only pain.
You're the queen. Without you, the king would rule badly.
The people would suffer.
Your exile would be bitter.
Bitter?
Any more bitter than being married to a man who is estranged to me?
More bitter than having you go out of my life forever?
Once I promised you to devote myself to the welfare of our country.
Would you take away the one ruler who could bring her happiness?
I asked you that when I was queen.
I am no longer.
You are. You always will be.
I shall be the only one...
...who knew that for just a little while there was no queen.
- Just ahead lies the road to Lisbon.
- Yes.
There's a great new university there, Leporello.
I've decided to devote myself to some serious study.
Perhaps write my memoirs.
Well, it will be a change, anyway.
At long last, lead the peaceful calm of an academic life.
No more romance.
No more the idle search for beauty.
No more, no more...
Your pardon, señor.
Is this the road to Barcelona?
- It is, señorita.
- Thank you so very much.
- Adios.
- Adios.
Juan.
No more romance, eh?
My dear friend, there's a little bit of Don Juan in every man.
But since I am Don Juan, there must be more of it in me.
Bye, Alvin.
I'll be a-coming back.
Ma.
What are they a-fighting for?
I don't rightly know, child.
I don't rightly know.
Come on, you guys.
Hit the dirt and hit it hard.
Okay, Sarge.
Now look, Ross. That's not a teaspoon you got there, it's a shovel.
- Lay into it.
- Okay, General.
Dig, soldiers, dig.
Dig your way straight down to China.
- Okay, Sarge.
- China?
What's the idea of going to China?
I thought this war was in Europe.
Parsons, Sergeant Early.
Yes, sir.
Which one of your men is York?
He is the big, lanky fellow, fourth from the end, sir.
- Having any trouble with him?
- No, sir. Why?
He's down here as a conscientious objector.
Keep your eye on him.
I want a weekly report.
Yes, sir.
That'll be a big help.
Dig. Dig. Dig.
I've been working in a subway all my life, never thought about the guys that dug it.
But since I'm in the army,
I sure take my hat off to them.
- Subway you say?
- Yeah.
What's this here subway you're talking about?
You mean to say you don't know what a subway is? That guy kidding?
No, they don't have subways where he comes from, I guess.
They haven't? Ain't they civilized?
Where you from?
Pall Mall.
Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf.
- Where is that?
- Tennessee.
Ain't you ever even seen a subway?
- Ain't never even heard of one.
- You never... What? Heard?
Heard? What kind of talk is that?
Do they all talk that kind of English where you come from?
Well, there ain't any English people down our way, just Americans.
Well, look, a subway is a big hole in the ground, see?
It goes for miles.
- Straight down?
- Yeah... No.
It doesn't go straight down, it goes this way.
- Oh, this a-way?
- Yeah.
- Under the ground?
- Under the ground.
- And trains run through it.
- They run through it?
- Yeah.
- Steam cars?
Steam... No. Steam cars.
- They're electric, Alvin.
- I sure would like to see one of 'em.
You see, they have to run trains under the ground in New York,
- because it's so crowded.
- Crowded? I'll say.
Look, it's the rush hour, the Bronx Express is just pulling in.
I'm standing on the platform, holding back the mob.
The doors open up and I...
You know what I'm talking about?
Just a word now and then.
Well, you see, the people are just coming from work and they wanna get home, see, and they wanna get into the cars all together.
They start pushing,
I'm trying to hold 'em back.
Well, anyway, the doors open up and now, buddy, this is where the fun begins.
"Move back in the cars," I yell.
Ain't no room in there, but I yell,
"Move back in the cars."
Boy, how I used to push 'em in. I used to pack them in like sardines in a can.
That's why they call me "Pusher."
All right, Pusher, that's mess call.
- Get a move on.
- Yes, sir.
This is the one bugle call
I ain't got no arguments with.
- Zaranopolis Nick.
- Ross, Michael T.
Hey, this one's full of grease.
Ain't you got a clean one?
- Clean it, buddy. And keep it clean.
- Sure.
York, Alvin C.
Anything wrong with it?
Well, it sure is a fine rifle gun.
I thought maybe you might have some conscientious objections to it.
No, sir, I ain't.
Careful you don't kill anybody with it till we get to France.
- Next man.
- There you are, York.
Thomas, Bert E.
Boy, look at that shine, is that clean or is that clean?
Look, Sarge, you can eat right off the trigger.
Not bad.
You call that clean?
- What's the matter with it?
- Look.
- I don't see nothing.
- It's full of grease.
Won't that make the bullet come out faster?
Clean it.
That's a good job, York.
Did you ever clean a rifle before?
Ain't never cleaned one like that before.
I done clean my own, though.
So you've got a gun of your own, have you?
- Yes, sir.
- I wouldn't think you'd have one.
Well, the next time get your sling a little higher on your arm.
Okay.
Pull in your necks, soldiers.
Those rookies are gonna start shooting.
Now, remember, you guys, you're using real, live ammunition.
A bullet hasn't got any brains.
It'll hit whatever you aim it at.
So don't start murdering each other.
All right, let's go. Ready on number 30.
Ready, number 30.
Not yet, we'll try it first.
Relax, Ross, loosen up. Yeah, that's better.
Take a deep breath.
Blow, let a little of it out.
Hold it.
Remember, keep your sights on the center of the bull's-eye.
Take up the slack in the trigger gradually.
Don't pull it. Squeeze it slowly.
Just like you were squeezing a lemon.
Ready? Aim.
I can't hold it no more.
All right, Ross, take another one.
Aim.
Fire.
Look, Ross, you had your thumb sticking straight up in the air.
Just like that.
Oh, yeah. That gives me balance.
Oh, it does? It gives you balance, does it?
- Yeah.
- Here.
Load.
Aim.
- Fire.
- Oh, my eye.
Maybe that will teach you to keep your thumb down.
That's something for the rest of you men to remember.
- A miss.
- Miss.
Ready on number 29.
Ready on 29.
Ready, 29.
All right, York. Let's see what you can do.
Aim. Fire.
I ain't much good at this here practicing,
Sergeant.
All right, next time get that sling a little higher on your arm.
Press your cheek a little closer to the stock.
Yes, sir.
Make sure that front sight divides the rear sight in half.
I reckon I know about that, Sergeant.
You reckon you know about that, do you?
We'll see. Here.
Load. Aim.
Fire.
- A miss!
- Miss.
So you know about sighting, do you?
I sure thought I cut plumb center that time.
You did, huh?
I can't no ways see how I can miss that whole great big target.
Sharpshooter York requests a re-mark.
Re-mark for 29.
Re-mark, 29.
Oh, I didn't see that one.
- A bull's-eye, 4:00.
- Bull's-eye.
I can't figure out how I got way down there on the edge.
Well, I reckon I can do a little better when I get used to this here rifle gun.
Here's five chances to do better.
Fire when ready.
Hey, what are you wetting that front sight for?
Why, it kind of cuts down the haze.
I always wet my sights when I'm fixing to do some shooting.
Okay, do some shooting.
- Bull's-eye, dead center.
- Bull's-eye.
Okay, York. You're on your own.
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.
Hey, look at this.
Right through the marker.
That ain't no rookie, that's Buffalo Bill.
Let's see that target, Sergeant.
Bring 29 to the firing line.
There's the first shot, and here's the other five here.
I reckon that there gun shoots a might to the right.
Where did you learn to shoot, York?
Well, I ain't never learnt, Sergeant.
Folks back home used to say
I could shoot a rifle before I was weaned.
But they was exaggerating some.
Now, supposing these here cartridges is a flock of wild turkeys, a-flying across the ridge coming this a-way, see, right at me.
Now, which one of them would you shoot first?
I'd take a crack at all of 'em and trust to luck.
Well, you wouldn't have no luck that way, Pusher.
No? Well, then I'd pick the motorman.
- The what?
- The motorman. The guy out in front.
Well, that ain't right either, if you wanna get more than one turkey.
Now, which one of them's got the most meat on him?
Yeah, what's the answer?
Well, now, if you shoot this one here, the leader, the rest of 'em will see him drop and fly off, see?
So, you draw down on the last turkey here, and then the next one, see?
Kind of coming from back to front.
Then the rest of 'em won't know they're being hit.
And, if...
Of course, they might flare off some when the shooting starts, but if a fellow's got himself a repeating rifle, he's got a good chance of getting the whole flock.
- Sounds all right.
- Turkeys sure is dumb animals.
Seems you picked up a good bit down in the hills, Alvin.
Oh, anybody that's done any hunting knows that.
Alvin C. York!
Report to Major Buxton immediately.
- Yes, sir.
- What have you been up to now?
I don't know.
I've been aiming not to make no trouble.
It's your move.
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Yes, York. At ease.
York, Captain Danforth has just handed me a report concerning you, made by your company sergeant.
Yes, sir?
You have a very excellent camp record.
Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that, sir.
You applied for exemption, I believe, as a conscientious objector.
Yes, sir.
Well, I think we can disregard that.
York, Sergeant Parsons recommends your promotion to the rank of corporal with special detail as instructor in target practice.
Captain Danforth and I heartily approve.
I congratulate you, York.
Well, I'm much obliged to you,
Major Buxton and Captain Danforth.
Well, I'll learn 'em fellows to shoot the best I can, like I already done Pusher and Bert.
I mean, Privates Ross and Thomas, sir, but, well, I don't want to be no corporal.
- What's that?
- I said I don't want to be no corporal.
- Why not?
- Wait a minute, Captain. Let him talk.
Well, you see, I...
Is it because of your religious convictions, York?
Yes, sir. That's it.
You see, I believe in the Bible, and I'm a-believing that this here life we're living is something the Lord done give us.
And we got to be a-living it the best we can.
And I'm figuring that a-killing other folks ain't no part of what he was intending for us to be a-doing here.
Well, yes. In a way I agree with you.
York, with your permission, Major?
Certainly, Captain. Sit down, York.
You... You say you believe in the Bible?
Yes, sir.
Well, I do, too.
But do you believe that the Bible means that a man shouldn't fight for what he believes to be right?
Well, it done said,
"Blessed are the peacemakers."
Yes, I know, but...
You remember that verse,
I think it's in Luke, where he says, "He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one"?
He said that to Peter.
But he doesn't stop Peter from using his sword.
He said, "Them that lives by the sword will be a-perishing by the sword."
That were further on.
- Yes, I remember, but...
- No, go ahead, Captain, go ahead.
But according to St. John, he said, "My kingdom is not of this world.
"If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servant fight."
Well, that's just the point, Captain.
He done said his kingdom were not of this world.
And that... That is different.
- Yes, but...
- Just a moment, Captain.
York, have you ever read this?
"History of the United States."
It sure is a lot of writing.
- Daniel Boone?
- Yeah.
You know about him?
Well, everybody down our way knows about Daniel Boone.
First man into the Valley of the Three Forks.
Yes, he was quite a man, one of the greatest.
And that book's full of great men.
York, what do you suppose that
Boone was looking for when he went out alone into the wilderness?
Well, I never thought much on it.
Was he looking for new lands?
- Might be.
- Maybe.
Maybe for something more.
Something that a man just can't see with his eyes or hold in his hands.
Something that some men don't even know they have until they've lost it.
- Yes, sir.
- To be free.
Now, that's quite a word, freedom.
I think that's what he wanted.
I think that's what sent Boone into your Tennessee country.
Is that what...
That what this here book's about?
Yep.
That's the story of a whole people's struggle for freedom from the very beginning until now.
For we're still struggling.
It's quite a story, York.
How they all got together and set up a government, whereby all men were pledged to defend the rights of each man, and each man to defend the rights of all men.
We call it a government of the people, by the people and for the people.
Why, I never knowed it was all written down.
- You're a religious man, York.
- Yes, sir.
You want to worship God in your own way.
Yes, sir.
- You're a farmer?
- Yes, sir.
You want to plow your fields as you see fit, and raise your family according to your own likes?
And that's your heritage and mine, every American's.
But the cost of that heritage is high.
Sometimes it takes all we have to preserve it, even our lives.
How you gonna answer that, York?
Well...
You done given me a powerful lot to be a-thinking about.
Well, take your time.
Well, if I could only get home, back in 'em there hills, I...
- What would you do?
- Well, I could...
I could figure something out.
I've done a heap of thinking up yonder there once.
All right, take 10 days' furlough.
You mean I can go home?
And when you get back, if you still can't see it our way,
I'll recommend your exemption.
- You will?
- Report to me as soon as you get back.
I'll arrange your furlough, York, starting tomorrow.
- Thank you.
- Good luck.
I sure would like to read this here book.
Go ahead. Take it with you if you want to.
You can borrow it.
Thank you, Major Buxton.
Thank you, Captain Danforth.
Come on, boy.
Want me to be a-setting four places, Ma, or just three?
Can't say, child.
Ma, ain't Alvin ever gonna eat again?
The Book says man don't live by bread alone.
Well, what about that there hound dog he's got with him?
He can't read the Book.
Get the table set.
He's up at the point. Been up there all day.
Want George to go get him, Ma?
Let him be.
Put your trust in the Book, Alvin.
But here's another book, York.
The History of the United States.
Them that lived by the sword, will be a-perishing by the sword.
The government of all men to defend the rights of each man.
And each man to defend the rights of all men.
Remember, the Lord done said,
"Thou shalt not kill."
But the cost of that heritage is high.
Sometimes all we have to preserve it, even our lives.
- Obey your God.
- Defend your country.
- Your God.
- Your country.
- Your God.
- Your country.
- God.
- Country.
- God.
- Country.
- God.
- Country...
"Render therefore unto Caesar
"the things which were Caesar's,
"and unto God the things that were God's."
Caesar... The things which were Caesar's.
And unto God, God's.
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Have him come in.
Yes, sir. Go in, Sergeant.
I'm a-bringing your book back, Major.
And I'm a-thanking you.
Well, you're welcome, York.
I done what you told me,
I thought things over.
- Well?
- I'd like to stay in this here army.
I rather hoped that you would, York.
But there's just one thing, sir, that I ought to tell you.
There's lots of things...
There's lots of things
I ain't figured out yet.
Lots of things still a-going on in my mind.
But it's...
Well, it's just like Pastor Pile done told me.
I reckon I can just be a-trusting in something that's a heap bigger than I be.
York, as your superior officer, I don't feel called upon to look into your conscience.
It's enough for me that I trust you.
And I believe that when the time comes, you'll conduct yourself as a soldier should.
Thank you, sir.
And I'm going to approve your promotion to the rank of corporal.
Well, I'll sure take care of my men the best I can, sir.
I know you will, York.
- That's all.
- Thank you, Major.
Aren't you...
Aren't you taking quite a chance, Major?
You mean as to whether he'll fight or not?
No, I don't think so, Captain.
I don't think I'm taking any chances at all.
"Dear Mom,
"am feeling just fine and have taken in all the sights.
"And Bert took me to a church called Notre Dame Cathedral.
"It's big enough inside for a fellow to plant a crop of corn.
"Pusher just come in.
"He's saying our outfit is moving up to front pretty soon.
"I reckon that's so
'cause we got all our training
"and they ain't brought us here for no sight-seeing tour..."
"Tour, nohow.
"Gracie wrote in her letter she was a-worrying.
"Tell her, don't."
I was feared. I'm a-feared for Alvin.
It ain't right for us to be a-feared, Gracie.
Alvin's in good hands.
The Lord takes care of 'em that's a-believing in Him.
- Any of you blokes got a cigarette?
- Yeah.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
You know, you Yanks just got here in the nick of time.
We're running shy of these.
Besides, we can do with some help.
Look out.
It takes a while, but you'll learn when to flop and when not to.
They say you never hear the one that's hit you.
That's only half the truth.
No, the whole truth is, if you hears it, you've got a chance.
Duck.
See what I mean?
- Heinie's got the range good.
- Yeah. A guy can get killed around here.
- Look out.
- Don't be afraid. This one'll pass over.
See?
Takes time, it do.
But you'll get the hang of it.
Duck again.
If that was shrapnel, now, we wouldn't be flopping at all.
You know, you only flop for...
Okay, Bert. The Express has gone through.
Hey, Bert!
If one's got your name on it, there's nothing you can do.
So you see, gentlemen, the grave responsibility rests upon us.
This entire German salient, holding up the Argonne advance depends for ammunition and supplies on the Decauville Railroad, which as you know, lies just beyond these hills.
It must be taken.
This is all open country ahead, but you can expect heavy machinegun fire from these wooded ridges on the right and the left flanks.
But we've got to get through.
Synchronize your watches.
Use as a mark, 4:32.
It is now minus 10, eight, six, four, two, mark.
Any questions?
What about artillery support,
Captain Tillman?
Artillery will lay down a rolling barrage at 6:00.
Zero hour will be 6:10.
I'd like to know where that barrage is that we're supposed to have.
Runners, notify the platoon commanders that we go over, barrage or no barrage.
First platoon at 6:10, second and third platoons to follow in waves of 100 meters.
Yes, sir.
- 6:10. All right.
Come on, men!
Halt and take cover!
We'll never get through.
We gotta wipe out those nests.
Early, take what's left of your section and work your way back around that hill.
Maybe you can jump 'em from behind.
All right. Savage, York, Cutting.
Bring your men. Come with me.
Take cover.
Listen.
Heinie!
Listen.
We're not far enough back.
Savage, keep the men quiet.
Cutting, come up here with that bayonet.
We're right behind their lines.
We'll skirt this ridge and flank 'em.
Look! Heinies!
Come on, get 'em.
Hold your fire!
Fall on down and keep 'em covered.
Spread out, men! Spread out!
Line 'em up and disarm 'em!
- Get back there.
- Get 'em up there.
Go on.
- I'm hit bad, Cutting.
- Me, too.
Savage.
Savage?
Where's Savage?
I seen him go down.
They like to cut him in two.
You're the only noncom left.
York, take over.
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you.
Watch this fellow.
The rest of you keep under cover.
Come back here.
- Where are you going?
- You done give me command.
Hey, Alvin!
Well, he cleaned out that machine gun nest.
Zeekenny, Donahue! The rest of you guys, keep your eye on them Heinies so they don't try any rough stuff.
Don't try anything funny.
Belly to the ground, you babies.
We better get up there.
No, we better keep an eye on these prisoners.
Five will get you 10 that guy knocks off your whole sauerkraut army.
There are 25 machine guns on that ridge.
- Tell him it's useless.
- What did you say?
I said tell him it's useless.
You tell him.
You talk better English than I do.
Just like a flock of turkeys.
All right. Come on out of there! All of you!
Come this a-way.
Tell the rest of them fellows to quit shooting and come on out of there.
Keep 'em hands up and start a-going down the hill there.
Keep a-coming.
Go on. Move out of there, down the hill.
All right. Keep a-coming.
Hey, down there. Don't do no shooting.
All right, get on down!
Come on out and keep your hands up.
Boy, I told you.
Look at that mob.
Hey, we can't handle all that gang.
Sure we can. That's my mate.
Come on, step lively. Move forward.
Get going.
- Move forward.
- Move it, now.
Move forward, there.
Come on, step up. Step lively there.
Come on.
- All right.
- Get those hands up. Get in there.
- Come on.
- Come on, get going.
Nice going, York.
- Come on there. Come on.
- Come on, get in there.
Get those hands up.
Come on, move fast. Move.
- Hiya, Pusher.
- That was a good job, pal.
- Where's the Sergeant?
- Over there. Hurt pretty bad.
- How many men we got left?
- Eight, besides you.
Watch them fellows.
Get in there, you guys.
Move forward. Move...
Pusher.
Pusher.
This is where we change cars, Alvin.
The end of the line.
Who done that?
Who throwed that grenade?
Come on, you, put your hands up and keep 'em up.
You know what I'm a-saying?
- You understand?
- Yeah.
Tell 'em men of yours if any more of that happens you and a lot more of 'em's going to be mighty sorry.
Go ahead.
Tell 'em to drop their belts.
Look them fellows over good.
- You ready back there?
- Okay here.
- Okay. Ready here.
- Watch 'em.
Now, get going.
Tell 'em to halt.
If you wanted to get back to the American lines, which way would you be a-going?
Up there.
We'll go this a-way. Go on.
Hey, tell 'em to halt.
What's up?
Sounds like them Heinies is making a heap of trouble.
- What are we gonna do about it?
- Get 'em.
We got enough to take care of already.
And a few more won't make no difference.
Hey, you.
Signal up there and tell 'em they're surrounded.
Tell 'em to drop their guns and come down with their hands up.
Hey, this gun touches off kind of easy.
They sure are trained good, Major.
Hey, Sarge, look.
- Looks like Heinies.
- Stand ready.
Hello, there!
- A Yank.
- It may be some kind of a trick.
- There's something funny here.
- Let 'em get a little closer.
- Hello there!
- Who are you?
Detail of the 328th.
We got some prisoners.
- Halt where you are.
- Halt!
That's a Yank, all right.
- Come out, let's have a look at you.
- Watch 'em, fellows!
Keep 'em covered.
Where you going?
Can you tell me where the 328th be?
It's up that way someplace.
- Where did you pick up all this bunch?
- Back up the line a ways.
You couldn't be taking 'em off our hands, could you?
What would we do with them?
Well, I don't rightly know.
- Can we be going?
- Sure. Go ahead.
Thank you.
Come on.
Forward!
All right. Halt!
Prisoners, hold right there!
Be a-watching 'em, Joe.
Beg your pardon, sir.
Yeah?
We all got some prisoners, can we be a-leaving 'em here?
Put 'em right over there.
Wait a minute.
How many have you got?
Well, I done counted 132 heads, sir.
We haven't room for that many here.
Take them back up the line.
- Yes, sir, but...
- But what?
Well, sir, we can't find our outfit and we tried to drop 'em off two other places.
And they ain't but only eight of us to handle them.
- You should've brought more men.
- But that's all there were of us, sir.
You mean to say that you and seven others captured all that bunch?
Yes, sir.
And we'd kind of like to get rid of 'em.
Well, good Lord.
I guess we can give you some help.
- Come on, Sergeant.
- Thank you.
Hey, Sarge! York by himself captured 132 Germans.
Guy named York got 132 Heinies all by his lonesome.
- How did he do it?
- Must have surrounded him.
- Guy named York.
- That's what they say.
Gee, he captured hundreds of Boche and machine guns.
Guy named York! All by his lonesome!
Hey, what's that? How many?
A whole division and a lot of high officers.
- I'm telling you, York?
- Who's they?
Yeah, about half the German army and a general.
- I don't know.
- One guy.
How could one guy...
- Guy named York.
- What's that?
They say he captured Hindenburg.
And the Crown Prince.
And brought them all back. They say...
Say, Sarge, did you hear?
York captured the Kaiser.
Now, as I understand it, York, your detail came over that ridge there and captured about 30 men, right down in here.
Yes, sir.
Then you were forced to cover by a machine gun that was right up on this other ridge.
Yes, sir. Right up there.
Where were you?
Well, I was...
I was a-laying behind that log there.
They was machine-gunning us pretty heavy, so I worked my way across up behind that log there under the hill.
Rather incredible, wasn't it, York, your being able to cross so much open ground without being hit?
I reckon the good Lord was a-protecting me, sir.
What did you wanna go over there for?
Well, I figured that was a good place to be because they had to rear up and show themselves in order to shoot at me and the rest of the boys back here.
And whenever they did,
I could touch 'em off.
I see.
So, I went up the hill, up around that a-way, then worked my way down the ridge to a place where they was flanked and couldn't show themselves without being hit.
So, they... Well, they finally gave up.
How many did you kill?
I don't rightly know, sir.
I think Captain Danforth is familiar with that, sir.
We counted about 20 bodies altogether up around there.
What were your men doing all this time, Corporal?
Well, I couldn't just answer that, sir.
I was pretty busy and I reckon they was, too.
According to the statements of the others, they were guarding the prisoners and couldn't expose themselves to the fire from the ridge.
All right, gentlemen. That's all, Corporal.
Corporal.
- There's something that I'd like to know.
- Yes, sir?
That night that you reported back to me at Camp Gordon, you as much as told me that you were quite prepared to die for your country, but not to kill.
What made you decide to change your mind?
Well, sir...
Of course, if you'd rather not tell me, why, it's quite all right.
Well, I'm as much against killing as ever, sir.
But it was this way, Colonel.
When I started out I felt just like you said.
But when I hear them machine guns a-going and all them fellows are dropping around me,
I figured that them guns was killing hundreds, maybe thousands, and there weren't nothing anybody could do, but to stop them guns.
And that's what I done.
You mean to tell me that you did it to save lives?
Yes, sir. That was why.
Well, York, what you've just told me is the most extraordinary thing of all.
Sergeant York!
Thank you, sir.
And for conspicuous gallantry beyond the call of duty, you have been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.
Sergeant York, I am proud that you are of the All-American Division.
It's a privilege to command such men as you.
Sergeant York, as Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces, it is my pleasure to confer upon you the United States
Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism beyond the call of duty.
Thank you, sir.
I'm Cordell Hull, Sergeant York, representative from your district of Tennessee.
I'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Hull.
And this is Mr. Harrison from the Tennessee Society.
Tennessee is indeed proud, Sergeant.
- Thank you.
- This way, Sergeant.
Well, Sergeant, what do you think of it?
Appears like everybody's having a mighty good time.
So, Sergeant, in the name of the people of New York, may I present you with this key to our city as a token of our very great esteem.
And may God bless you.
Thank you for what you said, and I'm sure grateful to you for this here key.
Well, thank you. And thank you all.
Now, Sergeant, the people of New York would like to show their appreciation.
Is there anything we can do for you?
Well, there's just one thing
I'd like to ask you.
And that is?
Well, if it's all the same to everybody,
I sure would like to ride on the subway on the Bronx Express.
I think we can arrange that.
Well, here we are.
I hope you will be comfortable here,
Sergeant York.
Well, if it ain't, I'd be pretty hard to please.
If there's anything you require, all you will have to do is ask for it.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
An awful lot of room for just one fellow here.
This here is mighty thoughtful of you, gentlemen.
I reckon you know I ain't seen my ma for quite a spell.
So we understand.
Representative Hull.
Oh, yes, yes. Are they ready?
Put them on.
- Somebody for you, Sergeant.
- Me?
Thank you.
Hello. Hello there.
What?
Who is it?
I... I can't hear you.
- Who is it?
- What's that you're saying?
I can't hear you.
Put it up to your ear, Mother York.
Stand closer, Ma.
When are you coming home, Alvin?
I said, when are you coming home?
Oh, I'm glad, Son.
I'll tell her.
She's right here.
He wants to talk to you, Gracie.
It's me, Alvin. It's me, Gracie!
We're all in here in Pastor Pile's store.
He's got this here phone in here now.
Oh, I just can't wait to see you again,
Alvin.
I can't wait to see you.
Yeah, yeah. I'll be coming home, Gracie, right away.
Yeah.
- Goodbye. Goodbye, Gracie.
- Goodbye, Alvin.
Bye.
Sure was nice to talk to the folks.
- I'm a-thanking you.
- You're welcome, Sergeant.
Just like the electric signs down the street.
How do you like New York, Alvin, as much as you've seen of it?
- Mr. Hull?
- Yes, Alvin?
I wanna be a-going home.
When do you think I can go?
- You're pretty anxious, I reckon.
- Yes, sir, I am.
I've got to get to work.
Well, as far as that goes, there's plenty to do right here, Alvin.
What do you mean?
I've been wanting to talk to you about this.
You're a pretty famous man now.
And judging by all these offers you've been getting, it seems a lot of people realize it.
For instance, two companies want you in motion pictures,
Ziegfeld wants you in an act in his new Follies.
And here's an offer to appear at the Winter Garden, that's a theater.
And here's a breakfast food manufacturer who wants you to endorse his product.
What does that mean?
Well, you've to tell him how much you like it, how much good it's done you.
I ain't never ate any of that there breakfast food.
Doesn't seem to make any difference.
Anyway, I've totaled the offers so far and they amount to around a quarter of million dollars.
They're offering me all that money?
It's just a plain business proposition.
I sure could do a powerful sight with that money.
There was a piece of bottomland
I was a-trying to get...
Here's your chance to get it.
Are they offering that money because of what happened over there?
- Well...
- That's it, ain't it?
That's it.
What... What would you do, Mr. Hull?
Well, I think that's up to you, Alvin.
I reckon it is.
Take all the time you want to think it over.
I've done thought it over, Mr. Hull.
I ain't proud of what happened over there.
What we done in France was something we had to do.
Some fellows done it ain't a-coming back.
So, the way I figure, things like that ain't for buying and selling.
So I reckon I'll have to refuse 'em.
Would you be a-telling them that for me, please?
And tell 'em I'm a-going home?
- I'll be more than glad to, Alvin.
- Thank you, Mr. Hull.
Here she comes, Zeke. Right on time.
Oh, there he is!
Alvin!
Oh, Alvin!
How are you?
Ma, I'm back.
I'm right glad, Son.
Hey, Alvin. How about your medals?
- What about 'em, George?
- I thought you'd be wearing 'em.
You'll be a-seeing 'em.
They better be a-something big.
As I was saying, Alvin, of course, I always figured on marrying you and Gracie myself, but I ain't one to take the job away from the Governor of the State.
Why, you're the dang-swangest hero raised in these parts since Daniel Boone and Andy Jackson.
Sure are, Alvin.
Hang on, Rosie.
Hey, what about that there piece of land
I was aiming to get in Tomkins holler?
- It's still there, I reckon?
- Yep, it's still there.
Somebody else has got it by now,
I suppose.
Well, I couldn't rightly expect Zeb to hold it for me all this time.
I sure would like to see that there piece of land, though.
I reckon ain't no harm you seeing it, Alvin.
I'd like to be a-seeing it, too.
I'll let you off at the fork and you and Gracie can walk over to the holler.
Hang on, everyone.
Hey, look here.
- Somebody's done fixed up this old bridge.
- Yeah, they have.
Gracie, I... I gotta talk to you.
It wasn't just the land
I was a-wanting to see.
There's something we got to talk about.
- Miss Gracie, I'm plumb worried.
- What about, Alvin?
Well, what with the governor fixing to marry us and all them people coming here from all over...
Sure takes a body's breath away, but I reckon we'll get through it all right.
- Well, it ain't just that I'm worried about.
- Well, what then?
Well, it sure looks like I ain't got nothing to offer you excepting a big wedding.
Why, some girls don't even get that.
Well, I reckon you'd like a place to sleep, wouldn't you?
Oh, I don't know.
I done a heap of sleeping while you was away.
You sure ain't expecting too much of a husband.
I'm expecting my husband to love me.
I reckon the good Lord will take care of the rest.
Well, looks like he's done a heap already, just a-having you. But...
Well, I was expecting to take over from here myself.
I reckon you'll get to do your share.
No, Gracie, it can't be that a-way.
We got to wait.
Maybe in another two or three years, if you're willing to wait...
Oh, but I ain't, that's the point.
- You mean you won't wait?
- There ain't no need of waiting.
Now, Alvin, you keep looking down and don't you be looking up till I tell you.
Come on.
There! Now you can look.
What do you see, Alvin? Tell me.
It's yours, Alvin. It's all yours.
They give it to you.
The people of the state of Tennessee for what you done.
- You mean...
- Only, it's 200 acres and the house is bigger, with more windows, and the kitchen's got a pump.
And it's for us.
The Lord sure does move in mysterious ways.
Come on.
Up in the sky, look!
- It's a bird.
- It's a plane.
It's Superman!
Faster than a streak of lightning.
More powerful than the pounding surf.
Mightier than a roaring hurricane.
This amazing stranger from the planet Krypton...
...the Man of Steel...
...Superman!
Possessing remarkable physical strength...
...Superman fights a never-ending battle for truth and justice...
...disguised as a mild-mannered newspaper reporter Clark Kent.
Flash. Following closely in the wake of a series of baffling crimes...
...the body of an elderly man has been found in the marsh flats outside the city.
He has been identified as the watchman at the Metropolis Munitions Plant.
There's a story, or I'm no reporter.
He is believed to be the victim of an organized ring of saboteurs.
More news later.
Sounds like there might be a story at the plant, Lois.
Lois? Me name is Louis, not Lois.
Gee whiz, everybody interpolates me name wrong.
It's Louis, L-O-U-l-S. Lois.
Louise. Lucy.
Now I'm so mixed up
I don't know who I am.
Okay, watchman, take your post in the main shop.
- And be on the alert.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Oh, pardon me.
Report upstairs, 12:00. Very important.
Report upstairs, 12:00. Very important.
I wonder what the big shot wants.
That was a good job you did on the watchman last night.
Now how about that dynamite charge under the shops?
It's wired to the switch on the plant floor below.
When the new watchman pulls that switch tonight, the whole place will...
Get that girl.
All right, men, now load in the dynamite.
Jones speaking.
Hello, Jones, we're ready for the test.
Send out the torpedo immediately.
Immediately.
Here comes the torpedo now.
And that old hulk out there is the target.
Naturally, for experimental purposes, there is no explosive in the torpedo.
Okay, stand by.
Ready.
Fire!
Miss Lane. Miss Lane?
Are you all right?
Superman, they're about to blow up the plant.
Freddie, throw that switch.
Superman!
Superman. Look out!
Well, pop, Superman put an end to their little act.
And this puts an end to yours...
...Clark Kent.
You wanna get rich in this country you oughta marry a hen! - I did.
OnIy she can't Iay no eggs!
No, not for 200. Not for any amount.

If we had, them mangy warthogs wouIdn't have jumped us. - You too?
Sure. We were just workin' aIong kind of peacefuI-Iike when at Ieast 20 of 'em jumped us.
What chance did we have?
You stiII got your gun, ain't ya?
You mean FIapjack was chased off his cIaim and didn't do nothin'?
Oidn't do nothin'?
He poIIuted their guts with Ianguage that shouIdn't be inside of no man!
But what good did it do?
They had the Iaw with 'em.
What are we, a Iot of sIeepin' Indians to take a thing Iike this Iayin' down?
What you gonna do about it?
- I'II teII ya what I'm gonna do.
I'm gettin' me a gun. And anyone that comes aIong'II see pIenty of action.
If it's action you boys want the games are open.
The roof's the Iimit, and if you're reaIIy pIayfuI I'II take that off too.
Cherry, that ain't the kind of action we mean. - Is there some other kind?
Yes, Ma'am. They stoIe my cIaim, and I ain't gonna take it sittin' down!
Oh, you're gonna do some shootin', FIapjack?
You bet I am!
And some hittin' what I shoot at!
Now, now, now.
Maybe we better think this over.
I don't wanna find you under that oId sycamore, with your feet dangIing.
But you grubstaked me to this cIaim yourseIf. - So I have a say in it.
You and Banty have another drink and stay here.
They jump from one cIaim to another,
Iike grasshoppers, Bronco. - Yeah.
Seems you can take away a man's cIaim just by fiIing an affidavit.
So far, they're onIy the smaII ones.
- Meaning what?
No reason their system can't work with the big cIaims. - Such as the Midas?
With both owners away, why not?
A visit to the goId commissioner ...?
What's his name? - AIexander McNamara.
ShaII I ... drop in on him?
- No.
First Iet's do a IittIe checking up. My way.
Ravishing as usuaI, Miss MaIotte.
- GIad to see you're out of jaiI.
A temporary arrangement onIy. I'II be back in again by nightfaII, I daresay.
WeII, weII, Miss MaIotte!
It's certainIy a pIeasure to see you.
- Thank you, Mr Montrose.
I want some information about FIapjack Simm's cIaim.
Simms?
Here we are. That's been reIocated.
Oh, it has? Under whose name?
Why, a Mr CIark and a Mr Bennett.
We have their affidavit right here.
Oh yes, here we are.
Now, see ...
Can I see this, Monte?
You won't mind if I borrow this, wiII you, Monte?
Nice pIace to keep my records, but the question is, what about access?
You got to that one easy enough.
- Oidn't I?
I'm Cherry MaIotte. I suppose you're
Mr McNamara. - G.C. GoId Commissioner.
TeII the marshaI
I want to see him, Montrose.
Putting me in jaiI, Mr McNamara?
- Serious business, steaIing records.
As serious as cIaim jumping?
Got some particuIar case in mind?
The cIaim of FIapjack Simms.
I know he made the originaI discovery.
CIark and Bennett swear they fiIed in the spring, but they weren't here yet.
So I want this affidavit as evidence.
Strong taIk. But I'm here to protect the interests of the smaII owner.
But if you happened to be smart you couId do yourseIf a Iot of good, couIdn't you?
I'm wondering just how smart you are.
WeII, I've been educated.
- So have I.
I don't care how you operate ...
I mean, with two exceptions.
The Simms cIaim.
- And a certain mine, the Midas.
That's puts us into the big money.
Got an interest in the Midas?
Stock?
- No, not exactIy.
Oh, personaI. One of the partners?
GIennister? - We're acquainted.
I don't know much about him, but
I'd say he has good taste. - Thanks.
He does aII right in other ways too.
Not a man to be pushed around.
Big feIIer, eh?
Might he make it interesting if I wanted to move into his territory?
CouId be tough going, mister.
- But worth it.
So?
What's this I hear about me arresting Miss MaIotte?
No. I want to see CIark and Bennett.
A few questions I want to ask them.
WeII, Cherry, I ... - Some other time.
- You'II aIways be weIcome.
You work fast, commissioner.
- Thank you.
And since you have a safer pIace to store papers, you better keep this.
WeII, I couId be wrong.
If I came into the Northern some night, wouId you show me around?
Show you around? Sure.
If it couId be done.
Goodbye.
And I've been here aII this time ...
Somebody shouId have toId me.
About CIark and Bennett?
- Yeah ... No!
About Cherry MaIotte.
You met McNamara?
- Let's say he met me.
And you found out?
- He's either a very honest man, or this town is reaIIy up against it.
WeII, after we ran into bedrock after diggin' for three weeks ...
Look, the boat's here!
Come on, you sour-doughs!
The boat's in! Come on!
He's back, Bronco! - You're pretty sure he's on that boat, aren't you?
If he isn't, I'II find out why not.
- ShaII I get the buggy out? - Yes.
Bronco, never mind that buggy.
For once, Iet him come to me.
IdabeIIe!
IdabeIIe, where are you?
Here I is, Miss Cherry.
Here I is.
What are you doing with that dress?
- Just smoothin' it out a bit.
I heard the boat was in. I figured y'aII wanted to meet it in styIe.
WeII, you can unsmooth it again.
I'm staying right here.
What? Mr GIennister is sure enough on that boat. - Sure enough is.
Go get a bottIe of brandy and a dozen hard-boiIed eggs.
Maybe a dozen bottIes and one egg!
Eggs is scarcer than watermeIons here!
I don't care. Get 'em.
There's two things he goes for in a big way. One of them is eggs.
I reckon the other's ice cream, Miss Cherry?
I sure hope there's some coIoured foIk on that boat.
I's gettin' mighty tired pretendin' Eskimos is from Virginia!
She sure makes this oId saIoon smeII nice!
Cherry!
I knew you couIdn't hoId out.
Makes me some kind of a fooI, don't it? - No.
It makes you the right sort of a gaI.
OnIy it's a shame to turn on aII that good heat for GIennister.
You never wiII Iike him, wiII you?
- No. And you know why.
That Iooks Iike GIennister.
Up you go.
She couId be a reIative.
Yeah ... maybe his Aunt Hetty.
Roy, you oId sinner! - Cherry!
Good to see ya, sport. How are ya?
Better now. For a few minutes
I wasn't so sure.
Oh, this is HeIen Chester.
Cherry MaIotte.
How do you do, Miss MaIotte?
Roy's toId me aII about you.
No need to ask if you enjoyed your trip, Miss Chester.
I know Roy's taIent for entertaining on board. Oon't I?
Easy, Cherry.
- TraveIIing aIone, Miss Chester?
No, I'm with my uncIe, Judge StiIIman.
He's with Roy's partner, Mr Oextry.
''Judge'' StiIIman? - Yep, the Law.
He's circuit court judge.
I'm sure you'II be gIad to know that Iaw and order has come to Nome.
Yes ...
It'II be so much easier on the boys if the girIs have to turn in their guns.
Roy wants to find me a pIace to Iive, if you have no objection.
Objection? - I thought I'd take
Miss Chester to Widow Smith's pIace.
Good idea. I wouIdn't waste any time.
Miss Chester Iooks rather tired.
Yes, I am rather.
ShaII we go, Roy?
- Come on, Cherry.
No, I'II wait.
I want to see Oextry. - AIright.
See ya tonight, sport.
Cherry! How's my IittIe girI?
Right now she has murder in her heart.
You said you'd protect my interests!
Now, wait a minute ... - Not now, we have things to taIk about. Come on.
What others?
- Let's take the good with the bad.
You Iike her a Iot, don't you?
-That's the situation.
Come outta there, CIark!
I know you're in there!
Come out!
Come outta there! You ain't hoppin' no cIaim of mine, CIark!
Grab for your gun! Yank her out!
No you don't!
Are ya hurt bad, FIapjack?
- Where'd he get you, oId-timer?
If you get my cIaim back, Roy, turn her over to Banty and ... kind of bury me at sea. I aIways hankered to be a saiIor.
I hate to disappoint ya, FIapjack.
You won't die of a scratch Iike that.
You mean to say I ain't dyin'?
- I'm afraid not. - Oang nab it!
Just when a feIIa thinks he's got shed of his troubIes ...
That's the nearest I ever come to owning a mine - Shut up!
We gotta get her back first!
Take him over to our tent, Banty.
- Come on, ya disappointed corpse!
Oidn't scare ya, did it?
- Oo these things happen often here?
Once a day at most. - Lucky for Simms you happened aIong. - Yeah ...
You're a stranger here. - Not exactIy.
McNamara. GoId Commissioner.
How are ya?
I'm GIennister. The Midas.
Oh, Miss Chester.
- How do you do, Mr McNamara?
Miss Chester is Judge StiIIman's niece. - GIad to know he's arrived.
You know him?
- By reputation.
WeII, it's a smaII town. We'II bump into each other again. - Sure.
ProbabIy at the Northern.
I'II show you the room. This'II have to do tiII we get something better.
There's the bowI and pitcher.
If there's anything eIse, just ask.
I don't suppose Mr GIennister brung you up from SeattIe for nothing.
If you're thinkin' about marriage,
I'd Iet you have my room for a week.
It's very much more comfortabIe.
It'II be a shame to disappoint a nice oId Iady, won't it?
She'II get over it.
- But wiII I?
Oh, it sounds terribIe. I feeI Iike a designing woman. What'II I do?
The worId is fuII of so much better materiaI. Why me?
Who knows? CouId say the same thing to you. Why Cherry MaIotte?
But it just happens to be that way.
You're not annoyed?
- If I am, it's not hard to take.
If I have to compete with someone, you might Iet me start on even terms.
Is that what you mean?
- PartIy. No more?
Right now wouId be a good time for somebody to knock at that door.
Yes? - One of the boys is coming with your Iuggage.
I didn't come in at the wrong time, did I?
You couIdn't have timed it better.
I'II see you Iater. - Goodbye, Roy.
I guess a Iot of girIs wouId envy you.
Mr GIennister's a reaI man.
I'm beginning to think he is.
Miss Cherry, you sure the kind of medicine good for what aiIs a man!
AII we need then is the man, eh?
If you's referring to me, Miss Cherry, this country Iacks good, soIid coIour!
No chance of choosin', IdabeIIe?
- No pickin' neither.
Oid y'aII say Mr GIennister be comin' right aIong? - I didn't say.
And you haven't heard anyone breaking down doors ...
We've wasted a Iot of time waiting for what we're not gonna get.
Mr GIennister ain't comin' no more?
That's it. No more.
-But, Miss Cherry, we done given that man the best years of our Iife.
We sure have.
What am I gonna do with aII them nice hard-boiIed eggs?
If you want better resuIts than I got try sitting on them.
Sit on 'em? I can't sit on no eggs.
I'II mash 'em aII to pieces.
AIright, Oex ...
Light 'er up and speak your piece.
When you start suckin' on a coId pipe there's somethin' wrong. What is it?
Some sort of spy, ain't ya?
When two men have been snowbound in a Yukon shack aII winter they waIk out come spring either good friends and knowin' each other ...
- Or one of them waIks out aIone.
We've had nine of those winters.
Think nine years gives me Iicense to say what I think? - WeII, shoot.
If I don't Iike it, I can punch you.
If you catch me when I ain't Iooking.
I been thinkin' about Cherry.
Oh. You saw her?
- Yeah, for a coupIe of minutes.
I know you Iike this Chester girI.
- They come from different schooIs.
Yeah, but Cherry'II weight out the better of the two in the Iong run.
A woman don't have to wear a poIish
Iike a new dime just out of the mint.
Them that picks up a IittIe experience goes just as good over the counter.
Oh, a phiIosophizing oId sour-dough, eh?
Look, son.
CIose as we've aIways been, I've never nosed into your reaI private notions.
It's aIright for a man to turn a corner here and there aIong the way, but you and Cherry's my onIy famiIy.
And I feeI father-Iike towards you.
I don't wanna see you spIit up.
- And we're not goin' to, partner.
She's pretty het up. - She'II get over it five minutes after I get there.
WeII, ten anyway.
HeIIo, Mr Sirs.
Writing a poem about me?
Not this time, Cherry. This is about a Iady known as Lou.
Is there a man in her Iife?
- Yes. He's caIIed Oan McGrew.
He's a bad actor. He gets shot.
- Sound exciting.
Ravishing as usuaI, Miss MaIotte.
- StiII out of jaiI, Mr Skinner?
In and out.
How you doing on the door, LyIe?
- Bad.
WiII you rub my head for Iuck?
- Better. I'II give you a shuffIe.
You need a recess, Bronco.
- You're the boss.
Ante, gentIemen!
How's for hornin' in, sport?
Not this round. But there's a new deaI coming up. Make your bets, boys!
CouId a feIIa do himseIf some good in a game Iike this?
The onIy Iuck in poker is the draw.
After that, it's a game of skiII.
Cards, boys?
- Gimme three.
How's a man's chances of improving a pair? - Not so good, they teII me.
Sure ain't my night, Cherry. I'II be cashin' in. - I'II sneak out too.
WeII, if you get enough pIayers for a new game, Cherry, I'm at the bar.
Remember what I said when I Ieft?
''We'II make up for it when I'm back.''
WeII, I'm back.
Yeah, I met the boat, remember?
Listen, Honey, you're not asking for apoIogies and aIibis, are ya?
If I was the kind that bends at the knees, you wouIdn't want me.
But you're not. So I suppose
I can't get aIong without ya.
Sure you can.
Which aIso goes for me.
We couId do with a Iot Iess food, too, but we'd get awfuIIy hungry.
But if you get too much of any one thing, it's good to make a change.
Aw, come on, sport.
Let's get back to normaI.
Why don't we sIip upstairs and taIk things over.
We've got nothing to taIk about.
Miss MaIotte. - Mr McNamara, this is Mr GIennister.
Yes, we've met. Not butting into a private game, am I? - No.
PiIe right in. In fact, you can have my chair. I just cashed out.
No Iuck? - Percentage is with the house. Pretty hard to beat.
But it has been done, hasn't it?
So they teII me. It's a fair gambIe, especiaIIy if there's no Iimit.
There's no Iimit here.
Anything you can win, you can coIIect.
McNamara, we wanna taIk to you.
Some of us ain't satisfied with you.
Circuit court be here in a day or so.
That's the pIace to make compIaints.
We don't care about no courts. There was no troubIe before you came here.
You're not tryin' to tie me in with it, are you? - Suppose we are?
AIright, aIright! Fight's over!
Get back to your tabIes!
Pete! Oanny!
Pick 'em up and throw 'em out.
We'II have no brawIs here.
UnIess they're over me.
Thanks, that's one I owe ya.
- I hope I didn't make a mistake.
Meaning you've got an idea
I might have had it coming?
There's just a chance the whoIe town couId be wrong.
So Iong, sport.
Nice Iad, GIennister. His pants need a bit of pressing, but a nice Iad.
You promised to show me around, remember?
I haven't forgotten.
Some other time.
HoId on there. Stay where you are.
Who are ya and what do ya want?
I'm Jonathon Struve, representative for the GoId Commissioner.
I'm here to serve notice on you.
Oon't get scared, Mr Struve.
This oId eIephant gun of mine just gets speIIs now and then.
But there's one thing she can't stand, and that's IegaI hocus-pocus!
You're gonna regret this!
Mr GaIIoway has fiIed IegaI action, and you're gonna have to answer ...
Behave yourseIf, Betsy!
Oon't mind Betsy, Mr Struve.
That's just her way of sayin' goodbye.
Judge StiIIman wiII hear about this.
He'II know how to handIe things.
Nice work, Oex.
HeIen!
Wanted to see a goId mine, eh?
- What was aII the shooting?
Just Oex's way of informing Iawyers they can't serve papers here.
You mean a court order?
-Yeah, that's what they caII it.
We've got a different name for it.
- My uncIe must have signed it.
Which doesn't make it so funny.
- Why not?
Because it isn't a Iaughing matter.
The country needs Iaw and discipIine.
I've heard you say so yourseIf.
It's impossibIe for anybody to fiIe an honest cIaim to this property.
When Oex and I made this strike there was hardIy anyone here.
WeII, if you can prove that ...
- We can prove it, aIright.
And we're gonna hang on to this.
Nobody's gonna take it away from us.
You both know UncIe Horace.
You know his decision wiII be just.
Sure. Maybe we were a IittIe hasty.
But you didn't come out here to taIk about the Iaw.
Here's my cabin on the hiII.
BeautifuI view from there.
Come on, I'II show you around.
Where is Mr GIennister's pipe and tobacco? - Under the couch. Leave it.
What kinda taIk is that?
It don't do yourseIf no good,
Iettin' yourseIf go. I knows that!
What are you doing? Leave it.
And what's aII this junk?
What's wrong?
Oidn't ya say Mr GIennister's comin'?
Yes, but that's aII. Take that away.
- I ain't gonna do no such thing.
You gotta start out right with a man.
You put that tray down.
I'm gonna put it somewhere where he can't find it.
I couId murder you.
- Hiya, sport.
Oex passed me the good word, and I came right aIong. Brandy and eggs!
You never forget a thing, do ya, baby?
You're fired, IdabeIIe.
- Yes, Ma'am.
WouId you hoId this, darIing?
I didn't send for you for the reason you've got in mind.
I must be in the wrong pIace.
Who Iives here?
Nobody you're on friendIy terms with.
IdabeIIe, take that tray and get out!
- Oh no ya don't! This stays here!
Ooes I or don't I take that tray?
AIright. If there's anything eIse that ya wants, ya caIIs and hopes.
So it's aII over, eh?
No more IittIe champagne suppers, or pIaying on the piano together?
It's a Iong, coId winter, sport.
But we're through, eh?
You seem to be set up for the winter.
I sent for you to taIk about Oextry.
But you won't mind if I sIip in a few words about us?
Oextry's got an idea that
McNamara and StiIIman are crooked, hiding behind a Iaw and order front.
- Oex is fuII of suspicions.
But we can taIk about that Iater.
When you gonna get off that perch?
But Oex couId be right. And if he is, what about your IittIe Miss Chester?
Nice gaI as gaIs go.
And reaIIy refined, isn't she?
A Iady aII over.
She probabIy wouIdn't know how to use a man for a chump, right?. - Worried?
About you?
Why shouId I be?
You're much too smart, aren't you?
New dress?
I hope she doesn't just take your mine off you.
I imagine that dress is supposed to have a chiIIing effect.
WeII, if it is, it isn't working.
You'd Iook good to me in a burIap bag.
Here.
You're so sure of yourseIf, huh?
Everything arranged for your convenience. You just can't Iose.
WeII, see what you can do with this!
Nice aim you got there, baby!
OnIy, I think it's time we understood each other a bit better. Come here!
I'm warning you Roy!
You've got it coming.
I don't know what you have in mind about HeIen Chester and me, but there's nothing to it.
From now on, things are gonna be done my way. So get used to the idea.
And that's my way.
Like it?
I guess that's what's you'd caII puttin' it right on the Iine.
That's good enough for me, sport.
FinaI curtain, eh?
I did that beautifuIIy, didn't I?
Maybe this is a good time for a man to speak his piece.
You know, Cherry, you couId do worse than with a dude Iike me.
You couId peddIe this joint. We couId sIip off to Frisco. I got connections.
Get back to your tabIe, Bronco.
I didn't know he dug himseIf in so deep. CaIIs for tears, eh?
Tears? You know me better than that.
Get beIow.
You're the boss.
What the deviI's the matter with you?
Hey, FIapjack, here they come!
Just what we been waitin' for.
Come on, Banty!
Oextry!
What's wrong? - They're a-comin', Oex.
- A whoIe gang of 'em!
Get your guns, boys, and get ready for action!
Get your gun, Roy.
Where's your gun?
- Have an idea I won't need it.
And you better Iet me do the taIking.
You can be too quick with Betsy.
They ain't gonna move in on my mine!
Stay right where you are, gents!
That's far enough.
I'm here again to serve ya. You gonna accept it, or do we have to use force?
We're not accepting any papers.
-You heard him. We gotcha covered.
We're not Iooking for troubIe.
You'd better taIk to Judge StiIIman.
Ain't nothin' to taIk about. We own a mine. We aim to keep it. - Easy.
You and the judge can come up.
The rest of you stay on your horses.
I'm sorry my first visit has to be an officiaI one.
TaIk right from there, Judge.
Betsy here's gettin' nervous.
I reaIize how you gentIemen feeI, but I wish you'd try to see my situation.
Once the ownership of your mine has been IegaIIy estabIished it can never be disputed again.
There's no better titIe insurance than a sound court decision.
Suppose we give ya this co-operation, what happens then?
UntiI the case is heard a receiver operates the Midas, the takings being heId aside subject to a court order.
That's aII. And when I open court your case wiII heard immediateIy.
What happens to the goId in our safe?
- That stays here on the property.
Under guard and seaIed.
WeII, I've aIways been for Iaw and order, and now that it's in Nome
I don't want to throw it off stride.
Maybe we better faII in Iine, Oex.
You're not gonna Iet 'em move in on us, Roy?
It's onIy tiII Monday. GaIIoway can't prove anything. We'd win in any court.
Your partner's right.
You ought to Iisten to him.
I ain't Iistenin' to nothin'. Get out!
- Steady, Oex! Let's be sensibIe.
The Iaw's workin' in 45 states.
Why not AIaska too?
You're gonna Iet 'em move in on us?
You heard what McNamara said.
It'II onIy be for a few days.
Looks Iike you've made up your mind.
So you want things IegaI, do ya?
AIright. From this day on our partnership is through.
You and I are finished.
Take that into court and IegaIize it.
Wait a minute, Oex!
- What for?
So I can waIk back into town with a weak sister? Not me.
Oon't worry, my boy.
You've done the right thing.
I'II show up in court, Judge.
But before you make any quick decisions, maybe I better teII ya:
Oon't make any mistakes.
What eIse can I do, Cherry? - A man doesn't waIk out on his partner, Oex.
A man who hands his pants over to the enemy ain't no partner of mine!
If you're fond of somebody, you don't do things Iike that. - You did.
Oh, that was something eIse again.
- No, it wasn't. It's the same set-up.
You were aIways crazy about him.
And you gave him the gate.
It's not the same at aII.
I don't Iove him.
You're a Iiar.
I said you're a Iiar, Cherry!
AIright, I'm a Iiar.
Of course ya are.
But I don't know ...
I guess if it come to a reaI showdown,
I couId stand a Iot more from him.
BIast him!
Great IittIe town, Nome.
Something going on aII the time.
You wouIdn't bother us with good news.
Let's hear the worst.
Remember that IittIe safe GIennister used to have at the mine? - Used to?
They ain't moved it, have they?
- I saw 'em Ioading it into the bank.
Stay here, Oex. Where are ya going?
To that bank!
They ain't swipin' no safe of mine!
You'II end up in jaiI.
Suppose we try another angIe.
Ain't no other angIe. Catch as catch can, I say. - CaIm down, Oex.
There's two Iawyers in this town.
One's named Struve.
And we're going to see the other one.
Come on.
Supposing our suspicions are weII-founded?
What IogicaIIy wouId be the intent and purpose of the opposition?
Good evening, Cherry.
How are ya, Oextry?
We've got a probIem, Mr Wheaton.
I know. We've been discussing it.
Come on, Oex. This pIace is haunted. - HoId on, Cherry!
You three have something in common.
It might be time to bury the hatchet.
I know right where to bury it.
This is Cherry's idea, not mine.
I never go to court about nothin'.
They grabbed our mine and our safe.
I say we get 'em back the same way.
Maybe Mr GIennister doesn't know what happened to the safe?
TeII the IoveIy Iady that we're quite aware of what's going on.
Roy has worked out what I consider a very sensibIe pIan.
How does Mr GIennister Iook when he's acting briIIiant?
LittIe bubbIes come out of my mouth, and I smoke. You oughta know that.
Before we start the shooting war we shouId wait for the court case.
If StiIIman doesn't restore the mine, it's up to me to go to SeattIe to a higher court.
- That'II cost money.
Ten thousand more, I'd say.
- We'II manage to raise it.
You don't think they'II
Iet you take money from the safe?
PossibIy. But we can't say yes or no tiII after the hearing in court.
My guess is they'II toss it aII into the bay. And what fIoats, is yours.
Come on, Oex.
WeII, if you ask me, that Judge StiIIman's aIright.
FIapjack got his cIaim back quickIy.
- It sure surprised me.
If we want our seats, we better get in before court takes up again.
So the judge says:
''I'm givin' this mine back to who it beIongs to.'' And that's me!
He's a judge that is a judge!
The oId boy aimed his first guns weII enough, Oex.
When he kicks GaIIoway in the pants,
I'm for him. TiII then, I say nothin'.
At Ieast he taIks Iike a reaI judge.
Roy?
FeeIing better?
- My puIse is back to normaI.
But I'm not out of danger yet.
Looks Iike the number one boy may finish in front.
You wouIdn't bet on that, wouId you?
Now that we're oId friends you may caII me Miss MaIotte.
StiII running coId.
When comes the thaw?
It's more fun this way. Besides, the Iine forms in back of Bronco.
Mr FarreII, Mr McNamara.
Hiya, FarreII.
Something ya got for Christmas?
I aIways carry it. I never know when
I'm gonna run into a piece of cheese.
Bronco was saying he couId pick off the judge easiIy from up here.
I bet him 65 cents he couIdn't.
Want haIf of it?
Sure, it's onIy money.
Oo you mind if Miss MaIotte and I taIk as though you weren't here?
Go right ahead, if you think you can taIk faster than GIennister.
CouId be done ...
We started something in my office and we never finished. ShouIdn't we?
We'II taIk about it after we've heard what the judge has to say.
Stand up! Here comes the judge.
Take off your hats and no smoking!
You can sit down now.
The court wiII come to order.
Next case, Mr Struve.
GaIIoway versus
Oextry and GIennister, your Honour.
Oh, yes.
Because of the crowded caIendar,
I regret the court has been unabIe to give this case due consideration.
AIso, we've been cautioned, privateIy, against making any mistakes.
The case wiII be set forward 90 days.
What? Why, it's a skin game!
The order of decency!
- The oId goat's a thief!
I'm going to pound him on the head!
- You're gonna stay right here!
Turn me Ioose!
I'II tear him Iimb from Iimb!
Quiet down! Quiet, this is a court!
If you are questioning the integrity of this court, you're IiabIe to charges of contempt.
But you promised to decide this case today! - I toId you I'd ''hear'' it.
But in 3 months, they couId take quarter of a miIIion out of the Midas!
If you have anything further to say, say it through your attorney.
Your Honour, I think this extension is unreasonabIe.
I move the court set an earIier date.
- Motion denied.
Sure! Of course it's denied!
You fooIed this young whippersnapper, but you didn't fooI nobody eIse!
It's my duty to warn you that any further act of IawIessness wiII force me to send for troops to maintain order.
Court's adjourned.
I toId you that oId fIea-bitten weaseI was a crook! Now it's my turn!
The bank can't make you a Ioan.
A court order is a court order.
I understand. Thanks.
It Iooks Iike they've anticipated everything. - Yeah.
I'II try 'em once more.
Get a hoId of Oex. I'II meet you at the Northern in haIf an hour.
By this time,
GIennister's been to the bank.
I'd Iike to have seen his face when he found his account frozen.
Credit me with that good idea.
- It's Oextry I want to see squirm.
I can't wait to bend that rifIe he caIIs Betsy over his head!
PIenty of time for that, Struve.
How much wiII we get out of that mine?
- Just what GIennister said.
Quarter of a miIIion.
- Say, that ain't chicken feed!
What's the matter with you, HeIen?
Aren't you gonna ceIebrate?
A IittIe premature, isn't it?
- How's that?
Supposing they send
Mr Wheaton to SeattIe?
We've covered that. A high court appeaI in SeattIe takes money.
There may be other ways of his getting it. That MaIotte woman.
Struve.
Oid you see the ship's captain?
He has his orders.
Wheaton wiII not be aIIowed on board.
That satisfy you?
- No.
I may have more respect for GIennister than you have.
Yes, of course!
He's a big, handsome Iad, isn't he?
I hope you're not going soft.
We're here on business.
Keep that in mind.
- HoId on, AIec!
You haven't faIIen in Iove with him, have you? Have you, HeIen?
WouId there be some Iaw against that?
Judge, I've come to ask you to reIease our funds from the bank.
Such a petition is a matter of court procedure.
Oh, I see.
- You're sending Wheaton to SeattIe?
Seems Iike the thing to do.
Any objections?
No. Good idea!
I hope he doesn't miss the boat.
I don't think he wiII.
You're not Iookin' so good today, honey.
Maybe Nome doesn't agree with you.
Shut that door! Struve, see that Wheaton misses that boat.
Lock him up tiII the boat saiIs.
I don't care how you do it, but I'm hoIding you responsibIe.
How much do you think he heard?
- Who cares? We'II see what happens.
That's enough of that.
What I toId Struve goes for you too.
Just to keep you on the right track.
This deaI goes through as pIanned.
How are ya, Cap?
- HeIIo, Roy. I'm gIad to see you.
GIad to see you too. SaiIing tonight?
- Yes. I wish you couId saiI with me.
There's a friend of mine ...
- Wheaton? - Yeah.
I'm sorry, I can't take him.
I have orders not to.
So I heard. But if, after you saiI, you were to see a man adrift, say five miIes offshore, you'd have to pick him up?
Sure. That'd be the humane thing.
Besides, it's part of maritime Iaw.
That's what I thought. Another drink?
- No, I'II have to keep my eyes peeIed tonight for dereIicts.
- Thanks, Cap.
It's too Iate for IegaI shenanigans.
If we don't get that money, how's Wheaton gonna go to SeattIe?
I'm against whatever you're pIanning.
- So am I.
Any unIawfuI act committed now might upset everything.
Wheaton, you gotta get outta here.
- What happened, Roy?
I'II expIain Iater. Now get over to
FIapjack's mine and wait for us.
And keep under cover!
WeII, oId timer, you were right.
We're gonna do it your way.
WeII, now you're taIking!
Wait! I won't Iet you two dynamite yourseIves into a mess.
I couId get about $4,000 together.
That shouId be enough.
How about it, Roy? - We've got enough of our own. Come on, Oex.
But that was a nice thought, sport.
Thanks for now, I'II be back Iater to put some Iace on it.
What do you think they'II do?
If it was my dough in that bank
I know what I'd do.
Why don't ya use charcoaI?
- Because I Iike cork better.
How are ya, Mr Bones?
- Mr Tambo, I'm about even.
Even?
- Even better than I was before.
Come on, son.
AIright, men. Let's mount up.
You aII know what to do.
Remember, if you shoot, aim Iow.
We don't want to kiII anybody.
Oon't move!
What was that?
- Sounded Iike an expIosion.
I'II go take a Iook.
What's going on here?
What happened? - Bank robbery!
They shot the marshaI.
Give us a hand, boys.
Let's take him inside.
Thanks, boys.
Scatter and keep your mouths cIosed.
Get hoId of Wheaton and teII him what
I toId you. He's gotta get that boat.
What are you pIanning? - I got myseIf a date. Remember Cherry?
Mr Bronco ain't down there!
He ran out after the big shootin'.
Was anybody hurt? - Whoever heard of a shootin' with nobody hurt?
They don't go pointin' a gun unIess they figures to hit someone.
Why you drinkin' that coId coffee?
Let me heat it.
I'II be in my office.
- Why don't you go to bed?
Oh, I couIdn't sIeep.
Huh! CoIoured boy!
Where'd y'aII come from?
How's y'aII, sweet thing? I figured it was time we got acquainted.
Is that so? If you think I'm the kind to mess with anybody comes aIong ...
I say, if you thinks that ...
I'II pour y'aII a cup of coffee.
Wait! Y'aII ain't no coIoured boy!
You's washabIe!
Why, it's Mr GIennister! Why you raisin' up a Iady's hopes Iike that?
Wait tiII Miss Cherry sees you.
- HoId on a minute, IdabeIIe.
Let's get rid of this AIabama tan, and you better wash this shirt.
But you's more handsome than you's ever been before.
If Miss Cherry feeIs the same way,
I'II have to Iive in a smoke-house.
Get me some soap and water.
That's it, Cherry.
I don't know any more than you do.
When I got there it was aII over.
- But Roy and Oex were there?
AII I know is the bank was robbed and the marshaI was kiIIed.
AIright, Bronco.
Oummy up, Cherry. Here's McNamara.
Find Roy and teII him to keep away from the Northern.
Brought some friends with you? Cherry wiII be gIad of the extra business.
I thought she wouId.
You know where GIennister is?
GIennister? How wouId I know that?
Been here aII night?
- WeII, yeah.
I work here.
So that wasn't you who was seen near the bank before the fun started?
Handy IittIe thing, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Good evening, Mr McNamara.
- Oh, Miss MaIotte ...
We had to drop in for a Iook around.
- Look around for what?
GIennister. We thought he might have headed here first.
He's as weIcome as anybody eIse as Iong as he behaves.
I thought we'd Iook here first because of his certain interest here.
We want him for murder.
Oh, our IittIe boy reaIIy got himseIf into troubIe!
Ooesn't seem to bother you much.
- Why shouId it?
What you're thinking, McNamara, is yesterday's news.
If you knew me better, you'd know
I never pIay on the Iosing team.
I'II have to Iook around your rooms upstairs as weII as here.
In the Iine of duty, you know ...
You can't think of a better reason?
You two boys cover the entrances.
You come with me.
Wait here.
WeII, here it is.
Look it over.
Nice pIace for a man to hide.
If there was anything here to interest a fugitive.
Think I couId pass for a fugitive if I acted up a IittIe?
That's nothing to taIk about now, with a gang of men waiting outside.
Suppose I send them away?
-Why don't you?
I shouId've gotten around to this sooner.
That's a bad habit you got, McNamara, jumpin' cIaims.
Apt to get you in a Iotta troubIe.
Got here in a hurry. We weren't expecting you for a whiIe yet.
Bad habit of mine.
Hard-boiIed eggs.
Oon't trip over the sheIIs on your way out.
AIright boys, come in!
Here's your man!
- What is this?
Am I wanted for something?
- Good idea, the bIack-faced stunt.
You might've gotten away with hoIding up a bank, but not kiIIing a marshaI.
If you're trying to pin something on me, you're gonna draw a bIank.
I didn't know you were stiII here.
- You mean he's been here aII evening?
Why not? It's a perfect aIibi.
- Why did ya bring me up here?
You said you wanted to search my room.
- AII you found was my aIibi.
Run aIong and find your evidence.
I thought I had you, GIennister.
But I don't give up so easiIy.
A trip to SeattIe might be good for you before I find the evidence.
Come on, men.
Mr GIennister, I can't get this bIack stuff off y'aII's coIIar.
Oh, I didn't know y'aII had company.
AIright, he's yours.
So Wheaton saiIed, eh?
You're a bIundering idiot, Struve!
A confounded, bIundering idiot!
What more couId I do?
- You couId've seen what'd happen.
You couId've sent a deputy on the boat!
But ya didn't!
Now he'd gone! Now it's aII finished!
You're a confounded, bIundering idiot!
Perhaps we shouId check out now?
- Check out?
Once Wheaton teIIs his story and they investigate your record,
47 marshaIs wiII be here and you'II end up in prison.
Perhaps you're right.
I got some news, HeIen.
That big, handsome Iad of yours
Iooks quite naturaI behind bars.
Judge, quite a mob of miners down at the jaiI.
You may have to send for those soIdiers yet. - I can't do that!
I'm worried about Wheaton escaping.
We shouId Iose no time getting out.
Take it easy, Judge.
PIenty of time to Iine our pokes.
It'II be 3 months before Wheaton gets back.
What's funny about that, baby?
- Nothing.
My, we're a joIIy crew, aren't we?
- CarefuI now, HeIen.
It's so much more fun making money the way we do, instead of sIaving for it Iike miners.
I'm not sure I Iike your attitude.
You've got a distorted viewpoint.
Brought about by what is know as
''the miracIe of Iove''.
TeII us about what a nice community it was before we came and spoiIed it.
Make it sound as sIoppy as you want.
But that's what we are: a cheap Iot of spoiIers!
Now that's enough, HeIen!
No more of this sentimentaI taffy.
But suppose the miners do revoIt?
They bIew out the front of the bank.
They couId do the same to the jaiI and free GIennister before the triaI.
Perhaps you won't have to bring him to triaI.
What do you mean?
That'd be carrying things a bit too far.
We've never had to resort to anything Iike ... Iike murder.
What do you want here?
- Picking a nice time to Ieave town.
Why shouIdn't I go now? I have things
I want to get in SeattIe.
You paid Captain Toombs tripIe fare for passage on a Ieaky oId freighter?
Who toId you that? - Most men who patronize my pIace are my friends.
Captain Toombs is one of them.
Ooes that teII you anything?
I faiI to see why it shouId.
If I wanted him to make room for a friend of mine, he'd do it.
And if I shouId want him to canceI a passage, he'd do that too.
- So what?
What are you running away from?
I'm not running away.
- You're Iying!
You've finished your job. You heIped those cheap crooks put Roy in jaiI.
And now you're going to sneak away.
- It isn't so!
Why shouId I want to hurt him? I ...
- You what?
Why did you come here?
What is it to you if I Ieave?
Isn't it pIain why I want to go?
I can't stay here and see him ...
You're in Iove with him, aren't you?
- No!
WeII, what if I am?
It's you he wants, if that's what you wanted to find out. Now pIease go!
But if you're in Iove with him, why are you skipping out?
A woman doesn't run out on the man she Ioves.
I can't stay and see him ...
I can't stay here, that's aII.
You can't stay and see him what?
They've got a pIan for the triaI!
- There isn't going to be any triaI.
There isn't going to be ...?
They're gonna turn him Ioose,
Iet him escape?
How are they gonna do it?
When the deputy brings him supper, he's gonna Iet him out the back way.
Outside they're gonna shoot him down?
- I fought them, but what couId I do?
Nothing. You're not the type.
AII you can do is run away.
- What can I do to heIp?
Keep your mouth cIosed.
If you do,
I'II see that you get on that boat.
If you don't, you'II stiII Ieave town.
But after I'm through with ya.
Why shouId I worry about what they're going to do to GIennister?
So they'II shoot him in the back. What of it?
You know how I feeI about you.
It's you or nobody, Cherry.
Why shouId I heIp him?
Now Iisten, Bronco.
For you, it's a matter of no one eIse wiII do, isn't it?
That's the way I feeI about him.
No one eIse wiII do.
Understand?
I'II make it five.
- I'II see them. I've got two short.
Three jacks. - That cIeans me.
I better go on with my chores.
A IittIe earIy for their supper.
- I gotta feed 'em sometime.
Excuse me, Iikem see Chinese consuI.
How many times I gotta teII ya?
The next consuI is in SeattIe!
Or maybe you'd Iike to see him?
- You unIock door, I go SeattIe.
Ya taIk Iike a foreigner!
GIennister, pass me that tray.
Take a Iook out in the office and see what Thompson's doing.
He's standing at the door, why?
I made a deaI with Oextry. I bring your supper, and you Iet me have it.
Then you beat it out the back way.
I'II Ieave the door open.
I'm terribIy sorry, Miss MaIotte.
Mr Skinner seems to be carrying an extra Ioad tonight.
What's the troubIe, Cherry?
Has he been bothering the customers?
Can't carry it anymore, Skinner?
Carry it anymore?
How dare you, sir!
I shaII prove the contrary by retiring to my customary retreat, unassisted.
My apoIogies to you, Miss MaIotte.
HeIIo, Skinner.
Good evening, Mr GIennister!
Isn't putting drunks in jaiI a IittIe out of your Iine, Cherry?
I had an idea you might
Iet me see a certain friend of mine.
It'd mean my job if I Iet ya in.
Court's orders.
They certainIy put a Iimit on a man, don't they?
Easy on the punch.
Not this way! It's a trick!
Get out the front!
Oex is outside.
Get into hiding untiI Wheaton's back.
Tonight we're taking back our mine, and then it's every man for himseIf.
Wait up for me, wiII ya, sport?
ApparentIy everything came off on scheduIe. - Yeah, so it seems.
But it's stiII a nasty business.
You better sip a warm Iemonade before you break out in righteousness.
I think I wiII.
Go down to the jaiI and Iet out a howI about negIigence.
Mr McNamara?
You probabIy heard what happened?
- I heard a few shots.
He tried to get away and they shot him. - Shot who? - GIennister.
Bronco and I were taking
Mr Skinner to jaiI.
We were there when he ...
Easy. Perhaps you'd better come in and rest a moment.
No, I'd rather go to my pIace.
WouId you ...?
- Sure.
Miss Cherry, I'm so gIad to see you.
There was a big shootin' at the jaiI.
Yes, we know aII about it.
- You knows aII about it?
Somebody get shot?
- GIennister.
Mr GIennister? Lordy sakes!
Get some brandy for IdabeIIe.
In the kitchen.
Wake up, IdabeIIe.
Oo you hear me?
- Who put out them Iights?
Nothing happened to Mr GIennister.
But I have to keep McNamara here.
I don't want to be aIone with him.
Now cIose your eyes!
Thanks.
Come on, IdabeIIe, have a IittIe sip.
How'd I get back here in Georgia?
Good mornin' foIks!
Now you'II be aIright. - Ain't there something softer to Iay on?
WouId you heIp me put her up here?
She thought the worId of GIennister.
Oh, Mr GIennister!
- Now, now. Have another sip.
I'd feeI better once I gets me on that couch. - Sure you don't Iike it here?
I is positive, sir.
Poor Mr GIennister!
He sure was a IoveIy man.
Hey, KeIIy!
- Yes?
Got enough steam Ieft to go?
- No, but it won't be Iong. Why?
We're taking our mine back.
We're gonna need your train.
But they've buiIt a barricade.
- That's why we need the train.
If you think you'II break through, you're crazy! She'II bIow up!
If it does, we'II buy you a new one.
Get in there and get the steam going.
As soon as the others are here we'II be set to go.
Except this couId aII be a mistake.
Maybe we oughta wait for Wheaton.
Oon't pretend Iike you're on the side of Iaw and order!
Roy! Oex! Here we are!
Set to go, men?
- Yeah! - Wait a minute!
Open that gate!
GIennister broke jaiI. He's gonna try to take the mine back. Bar the gates!
Come on out, men!
Get your rifIes!
Gonna be 30 or 40 armed deputies guarding that mine.
Maybe some of us won't come back.
If anybody's not ready for that, now's the time to speak up.
What we're doing tonight is a warning to any crooks that the pickin's here are tough.
Get aboard.
That goes for you too, Oex.
I'II take the front end.
You heard what KeIIy said.
You're not gonna run that engine.
Can't run itseIf, can it?
How 'bout it, KeIIy?
- AII ready to go.
OnIy Iet me outta here. They're gonna pick you up with a soup spoon.
What are you doing here?
- I aIways wanted to ride up front.
Here they come!
- Scatter, men, and keep Iow!
When they smash the gate,
Iet 'em have it! Shoot 'em! KiII 'em!
Let's crowd 'em!
Hey, Thompson!
You take charge here!
Post guards and don't Iet anybody come within rifIe shot. - I get ya!
WeII, Roy, it Iooks Iike we got the oId ...
Oid you get your mine back?
- Yeah, we got her back, Bronco.
I'd ... Iike to have been there when you tie in with ... McNamara.
WouId it be impoIite to ask for another bottIe? - IdabeIIe!
I is right here. Oon't be scared.
Bring another bottIe of champagne.
- Yes, Ma'am. Be right back!
Good wine and a IoveIy woman.
A made-to-order paradise. To us!
You were right, HeIen.
I wish I'd Iistened to you before.
If you want to catch that boat you better stop taIking.
Where's McNamara? - Over at the Northern, with that MaIotte woman.
But GIennister's taken back the mine!
- Who cares, we're getting outta here.
Not without me! I'II pack my things.
- Hurry. We're not waiting for anyone.
You're not going anywhere!
You got your mine back.
That cIoses the case.
That's enough now, Betsy.
- Now see here ...
Oon't get excited, Judge. You're staying here tiII the reaI Iaw comes.
You and the boys take care of him.
- Come on, Judge.
Where's McNamara, HeIen?
He's at the Northern with ...
He's at the Northern.
Goodbye, Roy!
Come on, sit over here.
- No need to hurry things, is there?
But you've kept the room between us aII evening, and I don't Iike it.
I've had quite a shock tonight.
But that's aII behind us now. The king is dead. Long Iive the king!
I've been waiting for tonight since the first time I saw you.
Nothing's ever so worthwhiIe as it seems beforehand, Mr McNamara.
No? I'II chance that!
You can Iead those sour-doughs around Iike chiIdren, but I'm a man who gets what he wants.
From now on, it's you and me.
No it's not!
You waIked right into the trap.
Trap?
- Yes. Your jaiIbreak didn't pan out.
GIennister's stiII aIive, and by now he has his mine back.
Your visit here has served its purpose, Mr McNamara.
Get out!
Get out?
Get outta the way, Cherry.
I haven't got a gun on me.
No? Then we'II do it the hard way.
Go separate them!
- Let's break it up! No you don't!
Let 'em fight it out.
Let that be a Iesson to ya.
Roy, that's enough. Come on.
Leave something for the Iaw.
Let me go, Oex.
Come on, boys!
Orinks are on us.
Hi, sport.
Sorry I heIped wreck your pIace.
Forget it.
But you said you wouIdn't aIIow any brawIs around here ... unIess they were over you. Remember?
Yes. But I aIso said:
''Anything you can win, you can coIIect.''
I like to see the morning run of my dogs, Carraclough.
-That's what I get up for.
-A beautiful sight to start the day.
All the years I've watched it, every morning is finer than the day before.
You're a great man with dogs, Carraclough.
Thank you, Your Grace.
And that I am.
Good morning, Lassie.
You're still the finest of them all.
Yeah, she's champion.
Finest dog in all of Yorkshire.
Yes, when you've got champion dogs in the country...
...you've got champion men.
I think, sir, 'tis Lassie's tyke himself.
Where is he, girl?
There are only two things in the world
I am proud of:
My puppies and my flowers.
It's either puppies or flowers a man must be proud of.
I don't think it can be both.
-My hydrangeas!
-That's what I meant, sir.
Of all the stupid, crazy puppies in the--
He's not stupid, he's only very young.
Never too early to start his training.
A firm hand, Joe. Belt him one.
I can't. He's such a foolish thing.
Don't you agree, Father?
-I agree with you.
-You're quite wrong, Priscilla.
That pup'll grow up an irresponsible hoodlum.
-Look what he's done to my gardens.
-Perhaps he just doesn't like gardens.
Nonsense! Everybody likes gardens.
Happen it's a point of view.
Your Grace likes them to look at, and the tyke likes them as much to roll in.
Something must be done about that pup.
At last, we've got a dog like our Lassie.
I want him trained, then I'll show him.
I'll make him an international champion.
That's a great deal of "l" for another man's dog.
It's the only way. If you don't train him, it'll be a scandal to every dog lover.
But he's only a puppy, sir.
If there's a scandal to bear, there's no one to bear it but Joe.
For there's nobody's dog but his.
That's the way it was with you, Lassie.
That's the way it's got to be with your tyke.
There's only one way you'll get that dog, Grandfather.
Oh, and how's that?
You'll have to marry into the family.
Wait, Joe.
Laddie, flowers are not to eat.
Good morning, Joe.
Good morning.
Goodbye.
Hey! Look out for my hydrangeas!
Little scoundrel does more damage to them than the pup.
No sense.
Like all the lads these days, no sense at all.
I'm surprised at you, Carraclough.
-You should've been firmer with the lad.
-Your Grace, happen I should.
But the last day of his leave is late to start.
He leaves in the morning for an advanced flying school.
Oh, does he? Good for him.
Look alive, now, girl. Look alive.
I never was so much alive,
Grandfather.
Oh, you can't sleep, so I can't either, eh?
What happens to you happens to me.
What's that, another scratch?
When are you going to learn that there are no friendly cats?
You know you've got to start looking out for yourself when I'm away.
Lose your appetite for other people's shoes.
They don't digest very well, anyway.
And be reserved when people come to call.
A friendly pat doesn't mean they want to wrestle with you.
Now, bear that in mind while I'm away.
Good morning, Lassie.
Look. Look who's here.
Come on. That's enough.
Now, you stay down there.
I gotta get dressed.
Stop it.
Now, you stop that.
I gotta get dressed.
Laddie.
Stop it.
Thank you, Lassie.
That's a good girl.
Now, why can't you do that?
You never learn anything.
Well, you look better in it than I do,
I must say.
Come on.
You know something?
He got your looks, but he didn't get your brains.
Laddie! What are you doing to my football?
What happened?
What happened?!
It's that wild beast of yours!
My washing!
Look!
Go after him, Joe!
He'll have the house about our heads!
Hey, come here!
-Are you hurt?
-Look at him!
Let go! Let go!
You tiger!
Let go!
Your papa's drawers!
Stop him! Stop him!
Laddie!
Oh, my present.
-What is it?
-Well, it-- It was a cake.
My first.
You baked it?
With my own fair hands.
Look at them.
Still, it-- It was worth it.
I've been trying to get into this position for months.
-Sorry.
-Oh, Joe.
What am I going to do about you?
I'm sorry. Laddie ran off with my father's drawers, and I tried to stop him.
Are you going to talk about your father's drawers or me?
-You do like me, don't you?
-l....
-Of course I do.
-Then why don't you say it?
A man doesn't say everything he feels, does he?
Yes, in wartimes, and when he's going away.
-But I'm only off to school, and besides--
-"Besides" what?
Well, it wouldn't be proper.
"Proper is proper," as my father says.
Ask your grandfather.
Grandfather's 60, and he's not going to risk his life.
You're 1 7, and you are going to risk yours.
So it's your right to decide.
Will you leave that dog alone?
Laddie, lie down!
Well!
I suppose he's trained to do that?
No, Priscilla. He's mixed up.
It's clever of him, but it's my fault...
...because one day he was chewing at my trousers...
...and I told him to L-l-E D-O-W-N.
L-l-A-R!
Please, Priscilla, pull it up.
Priscilla!
For pity's sake!
Bloomers start rumors!
I was just showing Joe what fine, straight legs...
...his children are going to have.
Hang their little legs!
Pull your skirt up. Be quick about it.
Hello? A military car.
At last, I'm called up!
Must have been that last letter
I wrote to the prime minister.
-Good morning, I'm the Duke of Rudling.
-Major Ellison. This is Captain Graves.
-How do you do? This is a happy day.
-Thank you, sir.
Among your letters, we find an offer to mobilize Rudling Kennels...
...into a war dog's training school.
It isn't exactly combat duty.
However, an old soldier accepts any command.
It'll be the duty of Rudling Kennels, sir, to select dogs...
...and pass on their fitness for enlistment.
I should like to see your kennel man, Sam Carraclough.
This is Sam Carraclough.
Morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Carraclough, you're to be in command here.
What?
You have the reputation of being the finest dog man in Yorkshire.
Gentlemen, I have no wish to take credit for something I was born with.
The scoundrel.
Congratulations, Father.
Oh, that's so wonderful,
Mr. Carraclough.
Thank you, miss.
Now, Mr. Carraclough....
Joe!
Joe!
Aren't you going to say goodbye?
You know your grandfather would never approve...
...of us.
And you know how I manage him.
But what does it matter, if you don't love me?
Who said I didn't love you?
Then say it, Joe.
Go on, say it.
Please say it, Joe.
I do love you.
I'll be waiting.
-Goodbye, sir.
-Good day, good day.
Carraclough, it seems from now on, you'll be giving the orders here.
-lt does seem that way.
-There's one thing I insist upon.
-What's that?
-I'm to be second-in-command.
That'll be fine.
I shouldn't dare show my face in the village otherwise.
Carraclough, you must feel free to convert the estate as you think fit.
Thank you. We'll try not to disturb the hydrangeas.
I should think not.
They're the best hydrangea--
Look! Great Scott!
Look what your confounded puppy's done to my hydrangea!
Here, Laddie! Come on, Lassie.
Come on.
Laddie, you get bigger, but you never grow up.
Does he, Lassie?
Here.
Lassie, are you glad we're both grown-up?
There's one thing you don't like about it.
It means you're getting old.
The things I used to do with you
I do with him now.
But thanks for giving him to me anyway.
While you were about it, why didn't you give him some brains?
Perhaps you did at that.
A shoe is more useful than a stick.
Come on, tyke.
This is only for Laddie.
Run on home, old girl.
Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.
All right, Smith, get going.
Get them in line.
Quiet.
Come on, Johnson. Keep moving.
Hut, two, three, four.
Heel.
Quiet.
Heel.
-Two more recruits for us, sir.
-You'll win the war single-handed.
We'll train more dogs than they know what to do with.
Corporal, take these dogs in.
Yes, I have a recruit myself.
You have? And what dog's that?
Laddie, son of Lassie.
Fine, but I thought that boy of yours didn't want him trained.
I talked it over with him last night.
He's on his way to active duty.
And now, with Lassie too old, and the kennel's in the war...
-...I think he sees our point.
-Good for him.
You hear that, Priscilla?
-Young Carraclough's enrolling Laddie.
-Yes, Grandfather, I know all about it.
Well, my boy, you--
You look better than usual.
-Thank you.
-I'm glad to have Laddie join up.
Oh, here's-- Here's his collar.
-Do you think he can do it? The training?
-Put it on him.
Hard discipline teaches it to man and dog.
I don't think you could ever teach it to Laddie.
Here, Joe. You're off for duty, so you'll have no more to do with the dog.
The training will be good for him.
Come along. We'll take him to the field.
-Come on.
-Yes.
The army will make him a champion,
Joe. Come along, Priscilla.
Up!
We find it best to let backward dogs see others leap hurdles successfully.
It makes them want to do as well.
Do you think so, sir?
Well, let me show you.
Come on. Over!
-Hut! Hut!
-Hut! Hut!
Attaboy.
Good fellow.
There you are.
Now, then, Laddie.
Are you ready, huh?
Come along.
Now, then. Come on. Over you go.
He's not very bright.
No. No, he isn't.
Well, at least he's resourceful.
Come along. Bring him out here.
Stop it!
This is a test of courage and a fighting heart.
Like a good soldier, a dog must be steady under fire.
We train dogs in other things...
...but a dog that breaks under fire is unfit for military purposes.
-Now, watch this. All right, let him go.
-Go get him!
Come on, Laddie. Go!
A perfect dog on points who's a perfect fool.
No matter what anyone says, Laddie, you're still the finest champion ever.
May I take Joe away now?
-Go run along, Priscilla.
-With Joe? That's what I came for.
Here, Joe. Here's our picnic.
I'd like to have a word with you, miss.
Oh, Grandfather.
It's pointless to worry the lad.
He's not "the lad. "
He's Sergeant Joe Carraclough.
I intend to worry him as much as I can.
Priscilla, you're distinctly offside.
I'm on Joe's side, Grandfather.
You're not free to be.
You're very old, Grandfather...
...and you think very old things.
You're very young, my dear...
...and you think very young things.
Run along, run along.
If you don't run, you won't catch him.
Good morning, Mr. Carraclough.
Good morning, miss.
I-- I was just taking a little walk.
The bus will be passing here soon.
Laddie, come back here!
Do you think he'll come back when he gets hungry?
I doubt it, miss.
That's where his heart is.
Yes.
And mine.
For the first day, you didn't do badly.
I guess you'll fly with me.
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.
I could have replaced you, but the boy I'd get would be just as bad.
Say, you wanna see a swell pinup?
Here.
That's Boots. It's the sharpest dog in all of Canada.
He can do everything.
He really smokes that pipe.
-I don't think I'd want my dog to smoke.
-What is your dog?
I have two collies, Lassie and Laddie.
What tricks can they do?
Well, Lassie does some, but Laddie doesn't do any.
-No good, eh?
-Oh, he's a champion.
You mean he's a fighter?
No, not a fighter.
They're both champions.
When the Duke of Rudling owned Lassie...
...she walked from Scotland to England to come home to me.
That's a champion.
That stops you.
Good night, Eddie.
If I'd known you were part of a duke,
I'd never have picked you.
Oh, I'm not. We're cottagers.
It's only the dogs that are champion.
You know, Joe, you're not a bad little kid.
Not very sharp, but not a bad little kid.
Laddie, what are you doing here?
Quiet! Hide him under the covers.
Try not to disturb the men.
He's my dog, sir.
I don't know how he got here.
I remind you that the possession of a dog is an infraction of regulations.
He has no right here.
He's creating confusion.
He's-- He's...
...beautiful, isn't he?
May I have permission to take him home?
He's tired. It's 40 miles from here.
Forty miles?
-Smart dog.
-That's what's so wonderful.
He's never done anything so wonderful.
-And he had better never do it again.
-Yes, sir.
What's this?
That's-- He was sort of enlisted...
...but I don't think it ever quite took.
Right in here, sir.
-That the boy?
-Yeah, that's him.
Father, what are you doing here?
I came for the tyke.
Four hours on the bus.
Well, you'll run away no more, my fine lad.
-Come on. Goodbye, Joe.
-Goodbye.
This is Eddie, the chap
I was telling you about.
-How do you do, sir?
-How do you do?
-Oh, this is the warrant officer.
-How do you do, sir?
Pleasure, I'm sure. Well, goodbye, Joe.
Oh, Father.
Wasn't it clever of him to find me?
I never thought he could do it.
Happen he's Lassie's pup after all.
Well, I must run along.
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, Laddie.
-Oh, Eric?
-Yes?
I'm a fool to lend Joe to you.
Last week, I lent you my razor...
-...and I didn't get it back.
-Anything good I don't give back.
-Goodbye. See you in a couple of hours.
-So long, kid.
Take care of him until I get back.
Stay here.
Laddie, come here!
Laddie!
When Carraclough comes back, he can spend a month's pay shipping him home.
Come on, Laddie.
Boy, you sure are stubborn.
Guess you're in love, huh?
Well, he'll be back in a couple of hours.
Just watch for four planes coming home.
Mattie.
What happened to Eric and Joe?
Last time we saw them was over the target. Started lagging behind and....
Better list them as missing.
So you finally coughed your way home.
Y es, Jerry gave us a few. I had to bring her home with one engine.
But I brought your navigator back, so you can use him again tomorrow.
-What'd you do with Laddie?
-I didn't do.
Come on, I'll show you.
Hey, now, Laddie.
Everything's gonna be all right.
You'll have to sleep out here with him.
Can't take him into the barracks.
-Yeah, I suppose I'll have to.
-Sleep well.
We've got a reconnaissance job tomorrow.
I'll be ready.
Oh, look, Joe.
The sergeant major says
Laddie's gotta be shipped home.
But I ran across Jerry Bartlett from our squadron. He's got some leave coming...
...and he'll be going right near your home, so you leave that to me.
-Thanks, Eddie.
-Look, boy...
...you don't have to put on an act for me.
I've seen an air marshal bawl like a baby when he had to leave his dog.
You know something, Laddie?
You've got to understand something before you go home this time.
One of the little things about war is you can't have your dog.
You're a very little thing for me to give up...
...when men are giving up their children.
I suppose when I have a child, the feeling will be something like this.
It probably won't be anything like it.
Perhaps I'll never know about it.
But, anyway, I know about you.
I won't see you anymore.
Photographs of this section of the coast of Norway...
...show us the beginnings of some new kind of activity.
However, all our pictures have been from 35,000 feet.
T oday, we should like to get some from a bit lower. Understand?
-Yes, sir.
-It's dangerous.
There'll be flak, of course.
But it's also important to know exactly what Jerry's doing there.
-Any comments, Eddie?
-No, sir.
That's rather unusual for you.
-Well, that's all. Cheerio.
-Good show.
Cheerio.
Laddie! What are you doing here?
-Laddie ever been in Norway?
-No.
Yes, he has, for the last three minutes.
We're getting close!
Look out, Laddie.
"There'll be flak," he said, and he wasn't kidding.
-Better hit the silk, Joe.
-But what about you?
I'll be right after you. Go ahead.
Hurry up. We're losing altitude. Jump!
Hurry up! I'm right behind you.
-Karl, look! I told you I saw something.
-That's a dog, not a parachute.
He is crazy. There's nothing here.
Maybe there is a name on his collar.
Here's a tag.
Quiet!
He is gone.
An English dog means an English soldier.
Maybe paratroopers are landing in this section.
We'd better get back and report this.
A puppy!
I found a puppy!
Come on, puppy, let's play.
Thea! Arne!
Thea! Arne!
I'll be right back, puppy.
Thea! Thea!
My puppy! My puppy is sick!
My puppy! My brand-new, sick puppy!
You see, come on!
Oh, he always thinks about his dog, the one the Germans shot.
-Here's your puppy.
-And not sick at all. He's just fine, see?
No, no, my new puppy!
-My brand-new, sick puppy!
-This is your puppy.
Look. By the time we get home, it will be all better.
-Come on. Up you go, now.
-I want my puppy!
Now, you stay there and be a good boy.
I forgot my puppy back there!
Henrik, come back! Come back!
I want my puppy!
Henrik, come back! Be a good boy, and you'll get a wonderful puppy...
...all for yourself someday.
Henrik, come back!
Come back, Henrik!
See? Here's my new puppy.
Isn't he pretty?
I told you! He's sick.
His leg is hurt.
Hedda, tear a bandage from your apron.
I'll be spanked if I tear my apron.
Spanking or no spanking,
I'd tear my apron to help a sick dog.
It's easy to talk of tearing aprons when you don't wear any.
Shame on you!
What are you doing?
Here, Thea. Make him well.
There. We'll take care of you.
We'll hide you from the Germans in our cave.
Oh, Arne, make a splint.
You know, the way I showed you when I broke my finger.
-Here's what's left of my lunch.
-Oh, that's a good girl, Hedda.
Oh, look, he's awfully hungry.
He probably hasn't eaten in a long time.
I have no more.
We can save our supper and then feed him tomorrow.
I won't get any supper because
I tore my shirt. But I've got a dog.
-He's my dog.
-He belongs to all of us.
-I found him.
-Well, then you can name him.
-What are you gonna call him?
-Let me see.
-I know!
-Yes?
-No.
-Well, it's getting late.
-Why not call him simply Doggy?
-What name did you say?
She didn't, she said to call him simply Doggy.
I like that.
We'll call him Mr. Simply.
Oh, hello, Mr. Simply.
Mr. Simply's going to sleep.
We'll come back early tomorrow.
Come on.
Happy dreams, Mr. Simply.
I don't think you'll find the poor dog in this village.
He wouldn't stop here.
No refuse bins.
-Why not?
-Because there is no refuse.
Oh, good evening, Mrs. Strohm.
Now, don't hurry on.
It's all right to come in.
Very devout woman, Mrs. Strohm.
You may have noticed her coming here in the evening to pray.
I shall try to find who are dog fanciers among my congregation.
Perhaps they will help.
Of course, when you consider, the only true dog fancier in the world is the flea.
Now!
Come on, Henrik.
Hurry up with that dog.
Come on.
Please, Mr. Simply. Come.
Stop it, Mr. Simply. Stop it!
Please, Mr. Simply. Come,
I've got something nice for you to eat.
Wait a minute.
-Henrik, what are you doing?
-Eat, Mr. Simply.
It's no use, he won't eat. He's been like this ever since he got well.
Eat, Mr. Simply. Please eat.
If you eat, you'll grow up to be a big, strong man.
Stop, now. You're only bothering him.
Besides, dogs don't grow up to be big, strong men.
-Not even if they eat?
-Not even if they drink milk.
Not even if they drink all the milk in the world?
-Not even then.
-Oh, well.
Maybe he doesn't like us anymore.
That's the way he looked when he was hurt.
Maybe he doesn't wanna be our dog.
Don't you?
Don't you want to be our dog?
-Germans!
-Come on, cover up the dog!
Did you hear what they said?
Very suspicious.
That's the first time
I've heard that from Norwegians.
-They are up to something.
-Come here!
-Have you seen a dog?
-Stand still!
Have you seen a dog?
-Well?
-Have we seen a dog?
-A dog?
-No, no dog here.
-What have you got here?
-Wood. We've been gathering firewood.
-What's the matter with him?
-He-- He thinks he's a dog.
He's very young. You know, playing.
He always plays that game.
He barks like this.
No! He barks like this!
No, like this!
All right, all right, go ahead!
What a country.
Stupid people, barking children.
Come on.
Mr. Simply!
Mr. Simply!
Please, God.
Keep Mr. Simply safe from the Germans.
I found him, and I love him.
And I don't want to lose him.
Bring Mr. Simply back.
Please, God, bring him back.
Look!
Halt!
Where did you get this dog?
He is English.
It's not my dog. I never saw him before.
You were here yesterday.
Why are you here again?
I come here every day.
-What about your dog?
-lt isn't my dog.
Look! If it were, it wouldn't run away from me.
You wait here!
Heavenly father, who hearest us always...
...grant these children their prayer for the safety of their dog.
In caring for our little animal brothers...
...these children are educating their hearts in unselfishness.
Preserve their pure hearts.
These children are not asking anything for themselves.
They ask only for the safety of a poor animal.
This love that fills their hearts is your love...
...which I ask shall ever abide in them...
-...and lead them in your footsteps.
-Mr. Simply!
It's a miracle!
Keep these children, as they are now, from selfishness...
...which is the wickedness, the vileness...
...the cruelty of the world.
We ask as always that everything that breathes...
...be preserved from suffering.
-What's in here?
-A storeroom.
-Why is it locked?
-T o keep out thieves.
Air raid!
Come here, Joe.
-This is a fine morning.
-Yes, it is.
I'm sorry to leave you and your wonderful stories about the Vikings.
I make a right liar, Joe.
One thing I told you is the truth.
One Viking alone can smash a platoon of Germans...
...just by standing on them with his two feet.
I believe it, Olav.
If I didn't have to stay here and hide you boys...
...I'd go down and jump on that German army myself to show you how it's done.
You are a good soldier too. I know that, because you are a good companion.
I'm afraid I've been talking mostly about my dog.
I know it's my duty to get back to England into the fight again...
...but it's not easy to leave Laddie behind.
I keep thinking about finding him.
Sometimes I even wake up at night and think I can hear him barking.
After what you and your friends have faced, I suppose I sound rather silly.
No, you're not silly.
It isn't silly to have something dear to your heart and to talk about it.
A man who lives for himself is very empty.
The others, they talk about their girls, their wives and children.
You talk about your dog, because you love him.
Now, remember, hide by day and travel by night.
And don't try to contact the underground. They'll find you.
Operator MCS will take you down to the coast.
When you get to the high cliffs, you can see Anton's house and his fishing boat.
Anton will contact the British intelligence.
Another soldier goes home to fight.
Goodbye, Olav.
-Goodbye.
-And thank you.
Well....
So you are Laddie, huh?
I've heard a lot about you...
...but I never thought
I was going to see you.
You are a long way from the duke's hydrangeas now, aren't you?
Well...
...you'll go back to England and dig up those hydrangeas again.
The duke will be so glad to see you...
...that he'll grow some new ones just for you.
MCS calling number 44.
MCS calling number 44.
Dangerous enemy activity along coast.
Cannot pass anyone now.
Flier returning to you until further notice from us.
You' re going to see him again.
He's coming back.
This is a wonderful day.
This is a reunion arranged by the gods...
...and only they and I shall see it.
You know, it should be Christmas.
We should have an evergreen tree over in that corner...
...and you should be under it.
I should have a big, fat belly and a long, white beard.
I believe you already know that he's coming, huh?
What? Is he here already?
Be quiet.
Those are men of pain, torture and killing.
A shame to tell a good animal this is what men have come to.
Maybe they will pass us by, and maybe they won't.
Be quiet.
Good day.
It's a cold one.
I'll stir up the fire.
Are you Olav Grieber?
-Yes.
-You live here alone?
Unfortunately.
The women I would like to marry won't live up here...
...and the women who would live up here, I wouldn't like to marry.
Do you have a radio?
No.
That's forbidden, isn't it?
No one's here. You're wasting your time and good shoe leather.
March out.
Where are you taking me?
The prison camp.
You're coming with us.
You won't need your cabin.
Besides, there's no one in there.
That's the truth, isn't it?
-Yes, that's the truth.
-No British soldiers?
No. Why do you ask me that?
Because we have caught one, and he came from this mountain.
Your hut won't shelter any more British.
No, wait!
The first I've seen in a whole year.
Hello, boy. Hello, chum.
-He understands.
-I believe it's a Britisher.
Ought to know better than to hang around here.
Go on, or we be finding you in a stew.
-A dog? What kind of dog?
-It's a collie. He's a beauty.
Oh, let me touch him.
Hello, boy. Hello, then.
Yes, it's good to meet you too.
Move back from the fence! Separate!
-Let him in, won't you?
-He's going to shoot him.
-No!
-Lower your gun!
It's Sergeant Schmidt.
Couldn't we have him in?
He'd be no trouble, I promise.
I could teach him to lead me, and then I could work and be some use.
Let the dog enter.
-Oh, you are a sweetheart.
-You are a little beauty.
Look, he's got a collar.
-"War dogs. "
-War dogs?
-What is he doing over here?
-You're a long way from home.
Here. That dog needs water and food. There.
Let him lead you, prisoner.
Thanks, sergeant.
That's decent of you.
I'll take him for a drink of water.
And at mess, he can share my rations.
Come on.
Clever fellow. How did you know it was my clothes peg?
This isn't mine.
I wonder whose--
Carraclough.
-Go to your quarters.
-You promised I should have him.
Go!
You stay here.
He's an English collie, and he came direct to that escaped prisoner's towel.
You think that poor-looking animal can follow the prisoner's scent...
...when your own trained dogs couldn't?
My dogs couldn't because the scent was overlapped by so many others.
But this dog knows only his master in this country.
You can see by his condition what he has been through.
He'll follow his single trail no matter who has crossed it.
Lower your tone, sergeant.
Any moment, I expect you to bark like a dog.
-Y es, sir.
-As a soldier, Schmidt...
...you're a comedian.
You're not a man, you're a clown.
And asking me for orders to trot all over Norway...
...with this bag of bones here to pursue a prisoner...
...is the culmination of your dog obsession.
-He's following the scent. You see?
-Quiet.
Don't bark.
Proceed, comedian. It will be pleasant not to have my eyes revolted...
...by that gargoyle shape in the uniform of our great army.
There. Y es, you're a good dog, a fine dog.
Here, here, there's nothing to be afraid of.
We're friends. Good friends, ja?
Now, you go ahead. Go ahead.
Ja, that's right, you want out.
Come on.
Come on. We'll go out too.
Olav certainly didn't exaggerate how kind you'd be to me.
I can't thank you enough,
Joanna, Anton.
When you are safe in England...
...send us a message through the underground. That's enough.
And when the war is over, we meet again, eh?
You both must come to England to meet my father.
He will not make us sleep in the cellar, eh?
Nothing but the best bedroom.
So young.
Take care of yourself.
You are still not strong.
It won't be easy for you to manage the boat on your own...
...even though it is a little one.
Anything bigger would be hard to hide from them.
But with luck, you should make it.
You know, you are very lucky...
...the British intelligence contacted a submarine.
-But you must be sure to--
-I'll be there at midnight. Don't worry.
Look.
Careful. Don't panic.
You know what to do and say.
You. Your papers.
Yours.
I'm sorry. He's not very....
Your papers!
Come. Both of you.
-Where to?
-You will see.
But we're just setting out for work.
We are fishermen. You saw our permits.
My husband is the only man in the district with a permit to fish.
-lf he does not go out, we shall starve.
-Too bad.
-But the tide is high now.
-lt'll be high again tonight and tomorrow.
Come.
-Don't worry, we will be all right.
-Anton.
We will be back tonight.
Won't we, Peter, old man?
All right, get to work.
This is too much, digging German fortifications.
Good practice for digging their graves.
Won't be long before the day of reckoning.
All right, get on the job!
-What is it?
-Look!
-It's Laddie! He's found me!
-Don't stop.
Keep digging. Whatever you do, you must not give yourself away.
-He's my dog.
-When the dog comes close to you...
-...kick him away from you. Beat him.
-Stop talking. Work.
I'm sure he's somewhere in the camp.
Probably posing as one of those workmen.
-Say "sir" when you address me, soldier.
-Sir.
What do you expect me to do?
Stop the work of the German army while you examine every man's papers?
That will not be necessary, sir.
With your permission....
Good dog.
Find him. Find your master.
-That's a fine dog.
-Come here.
I wonder what he's doing here.
There's a beautiful dog.
Evidently, the dog is owned by a corporation.
Everybody, quiet! Get back to work!
-Here, boy. Here, boy.
-Here! Stop that!
So the dog has found his master.
That's right, you found me.
I'm Joe Carraclough.
Come out of there!
Walk ahead, prisoner.
Where are you taking us?
Back to the prison from which you escaped. Let me warn you:
Any funny business, and I won't hesitate to kill.
I'm sure you won't.
You may be very sure.
Here, Laddie. Go get it.
He can't even retrieve a stick.
Your dog is a hopeless fool, and so are you.
Why didn't you kick him away from you?
If you kicked him, I would've believed you weren't the man I wanted.
That commanding officer thought I needed a guard to help me.
I alone found you, and I alone will take you in.
The high command may even hear of this exploit.
Turn around!
I ought to make you walk backward.
Then you'll pay attention to what I say!
And if I don't?
You are not wearing your uniform.
I can shoot you as a spy or for any reason that I choose.
Now, turn around!
And march!
I am in command here.
What I say is so.
You are not a soldier, you're a comedian.
-You are not a man, you are a clown.
-You may be right.
A clown is all you could capture.
Because you wouldn't hit the dog, you're a better man?
-I know I am.
-We shall see.
There are many ways in this world to judge the better man...
...but I know only one way!
The better man is the man who lives!
Come on, Laddie.
Come on, boy.
If he should live through those rapids, post a guard at the fisherman's house.
All right, Laddie.
In we go.
Lights are forbidden.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
What's that?
It is nothing but the tide.
Do you have to stand guard here all night?
It's orders.
Come in.
I'll give you some food.
-Good morning.
-Oh, excuse me.
Oh, no, please.
So you come here too?
It's a champion thing to do, sitting here looking out across the moors.
Joe always felt that too.
If I wanted to find him,
'tis here I'd look.
Some of our lads coming home.
There's nothing to bark at, Lassie.
I'd not be too sure, miss.
Things speak to her that don't speak to us.
Her ABC's are the stars, the wind and the rain and the scent...
...and all things that move with them.
If those were our ABC's, then we'd know what she knows.
Come on. Come on, Laddie.
Come on.
Oh, yes, there.
There, there.
Oh, yes, there.
Hey, Lass. Our lads have come home.
There, there.
Oh, yes, there.

From Marquesas to the Celebes, from Sumatra to the Hawaiis,
the idyllic peace and beauty of the South pacific lay undisturbed for centuries,
but the white man came eventually.
He rolled it up, put it in his pocket, and took it home to sell.
His great trading empires, like Batjak, limited,
the Batjak of the Dutchman Mayrant
Sidneye reached out everywhere...
Hungry, greedy, demanding...
In the year 1860 that I shipped out on the Red Witch, flagship of the Batjak line,
under the command of captain Ralls.
Stand clear.
Wet them down, Mr. Loring.
They can go some more.
Mr. Arrezo, water.
- They had enough, captain Ralls.
- Did I ask your opinion?
You're getting it.
Anybody else who wants to fight aboard this ship... can see what he'll look like when he is through.
Now throw them in the brig.
Follow me, Rosen.
Strange, sadistic, and cold.
His eyes seemed to hold some hidden story.
Yet he commanded loyalty and a strange devotion from those about him.
I was one of them. My name is Rosen,
Sam Rosen, and this is my story.
Hand me a pair of those glasses.
- Careful, are you?
- Yes, sir.
Rosen, what would you say if I were to tell you I was going to throw you in irons?
Say? You're the captain.
If I object, mutiny.
But you'll be making a mistake.
- Got your master papers?
- Yes, sir.
I don't know what you were doing on the beach when we picked you up.
That's your business.
But I had an eye on you Rosen, seem to know what you want,
And I think I know what it is.
Nice round pieces of silver.
Round enough maybe to roll right into a court of inquiry.
As long as they don't stick on the deck there.
All right.
Our sailing orders call for a meeting with an
American ship at Davao in the Philippines.
Course East the Carolines and due west.
Now, somewhere around longitude 149,3 degrees
South, we're going to need a new mate.
Named Rosen?
Named Rosen.
That's for the benefit of the crew.
- Is that clear, Mr. Arrezo?
- Aye, sir.
Ripper...
- What are we doing on a starboard tack?
- Mr. Loring orders.
- I told you port tack.
- I thought you said starboard.
What's the matter with you lately?
- Nothing captain only you...
- You look tired, are you sleeping?
Not very well, no.
- You worry too much.
- Yes, sir.
Now listen carefully, Mr. Loring.
Head due north one hour and then west by South for St. George channel.,
- But that's off our course, sir.
- Is it, Mr. Loring?
- Don't you know our destination?
- Davao.
What course would you follow, the Southern or the Caroline skirt?
We were mapped due north to Kieta, but as you say, sir.
I don't like it, Mr. Arrezo.
That man is sick.
Loring is been acting like he's off his rocker or any.
- Bring him to my cabin in a few minutes.
- Aye, sir.
Mr. Rosen.
- Know who owns this ship?
- Batjak limited.
- Know what Batjak is?
- Mayrant Sidneye.
Sit down.
Know anything about him?
Only that he seem to own most of this part of the world.
I sailed this ship for him a long time and he has great confidence in his captains.
But Loring? A very noble character.
Protector of Cargos.
Especially protective now.
See, we're carrying a cargo of 5 million dollars in bullion.
That's why I'm scuttling this ship.
Come in.
What's your course, Mr. Loring?
Why, due north.
Your head cold, Mr. Arrezo?
I said head this ship
2 points west from north.
But, sir, I...
I'm sorry to contradict you captain, you said due north.
Mr. Arrezo, what did I say?
- West, sir.
- Mr. Rosen?
West.
And that's the way it's entered in the log.
Nobody told you to sit down, Mr. Loring.
Captain, what are you trying to do?
Do, Mr. Loring?
If I keep changing the orders around the crew will think I'm crazy.
Not just the crew.
But you're not, Mr. Loring.
Just a sick man, need attention.
Look at me.
Turn your head to the left.
To the left, Mr. Loring.
Put him to bed, Mr. Arrezo.
To protect the crew keep him locked in his cabin.
Locked in my cabin? Wait a minute.
This is a trick, you can't do this to me.
It's all right Mr. Loring, now you got no more worries, you're crazy.
- This is going too far.
- Off to bed.
- I take we're near longitude 149.
- Very close, Mr. Rosen.
I want you to remember every detail of what happened today.
The court will connect our stories.
Another thing...
Tomorrow make sure this position reaches the ears of the crew.
Where will we really be?
Right here under short sail.
You and Ripper take over the watch, head her into the sun.
- Yes, sir.
- No questions?
No sir, I follow orders.
One night, while skirting the
Caroline reef under shortened sail.
There was a feeling of tension, uneasiness throughout the ship.
Ralls was in his cabin in one of his black, strange moods.
I sensed tonight I would know something about him.
The man who held the destiny and fate of all of us in his hands.
I got out, Ralls.
You're not going to keep me locked up, not now or any other time.
I know what you're trying to do and I'll stop you cold.
I'm going to take this cargo to Davao even if I have to...
Get forward.
Look like Mr. Loring picked a bad time to break out of his cabin.
- How so?
- Look...
Been expecting to see them bottles two or three days now.
- Ralls was drunk, eh?
- Yeah, only not like you and me or anybody.
- Does he do it often?
- Only once in a while.
He's a good man most of the time, only drink a little, but...
- when he gets like that he, he is bad.
- Why did he do it, then?
- Maybe he remember things.
- What things?
I don't know. His whole life, I guess.
It was near dusk and we're heading into the rays of the fading sun.
Even though the plan was set...
I felt that Ralls was destroying a part of himself in sinking the Red Witch.
- We all set?
- Yes, sir.
Give me the wheel.
Get to your station.
All hands abandon ship.
Mr. Van Schraeven, you want to question this man on behalf of Batjak?
- There's no need.
- Thank you.
Captain Ralls's defense is based on the ships log and Mr. Loring supposed insanity.
Batjak, that is my brother in law Mayrant, whose illness prevents his being here, believes that Mr. Loring is sane, that the log entries are false.
- The only log there is.
- Yes Mr. Ralls, you made certain of that.
But there are other points which have yet to be brought up.
One is that you sailed contrary to orders after you been relieved of your command.
First time I heard that.
Mr. Loring... did Mr. Ralls receive a note from
Mr. Sidneye a few hours before sailing?
- Yes sir, I brought it to the ship myself.
- What was in that note?
- I don't know that, sir.
- Mr. Arrezo, did Mr. Loring bring me a note?
No sir, he came aboard empty-handed, empty headed too.
You're a liar, Mr. Arrezo.
Ralls, I gave you that note as sure as I'm in this room.
Are you sure you're in this room, Mr. Loring?
Captain Ralls, Mr. Loring, please.
Very well then, disregarding the note... perhaps Mr. Ralls can explain this in terms of Mr. Loring mental health.
If the Red Witch sank in the position indicated in this log... why did it take the survivors only 12 hours to reach a place that should taken 50?
My explanation to that is that unfortunately you're picked up sooner than you expected.
Will you explain this, captain Ralls?
I see.
Captain Ralls, it is the purpose... of this investigation to determine whether or not an act of barratry has been committed.
And in the event that it has, to recommend that you be held for further investigation.
- The evidence presented...
- Mr. Prosecutor...
I just received a communication from Mr. Sidneye.
Batjak limited withdraws its complaint.
The court is adjourned.
Pardon me.
Jail don't bother me none,
I got out jail.
But that Sidneye, he is something else, you can.
Once he gets his hands on you, you never gets free.
I'm telling you Captain, old Ripper is scared.
What you figure on doing?
Picking up a little schooner and keeping out of sight.
Plenty of routes in these island they never heard of Sidneye.
In a year or so, we'll head back for the Witch...
- and the gold.
- How do we live till then?
Fishing, we'll cut up old Ripper here and use him for bait.
Yeah, I'll bet is a better deal than he'll get from Sidneye.
I can't understand why
Sidneye dropped the charge.
- They had us good.
- They got his own ideas.
And his own ideas I don't like.
I'm telling you Sam, that Sidneye is a bad one.
One fella did something to him once... and he put this fella in the mountains with cannibals for ten or fifteen years.
With cannibals.
What is to me, they gave him a ring in his nose.
Any ring old Ripper is wearing, is wearing right hear in his ear.
Hello, Munsey.
I thought you settled down.
How is their majesty Navy?
Still able to fire a shot across your bow ship if the occasion arise.
Look as if you got yourself into real trouble this time.
- Not at all, you were at the hearing.
- That means nothing.
Mayrant Sidneye is a big man.
- He doesn't let go so easily without reason.
- I agree.
He's hard and tough and crafty.
- So I heard tell.
- No one has beaten him yet.
- Is that include your majesty Navy?
- The Navy has infinite patience.
We shall reckon with Mijnheer
Sidneye sooner or later.
- It goes for me too, eh?
- Definitely.
- How about a drink?
- Why not? This may be our last together.
Ralls said we spend a year fishing and that's pretty much what we did.
But it wasn't that lazy, basking in the sun sort of thing like fishing for pleasure.
This was a relentless game of hide and seek that just gnawing us day and night.
We bought an old schooner, the Melbourne
Queen and sailed the little-known routes.
But every port we hit, there was either Munsey or Batjak.
One or the other always there watching, waiting.
We didn't mind at first.
But constant tension of being spied on gradually wore our nerves raw.
Ripper worried about Batjak.
I worried about Munsey,
But if I have known then what
Ripper knew, I would've.
Well, anyway I finally bought a map of a pearl island from a sailor in a Singapore saloon.
We went to see if we could find it.
Well, she isn't on the charts, but she is there, all right.
Yeah, maybe we struck it lucky for a change.
About time.
By the teeth 9.
Hard and fast, Ripper.
That ain't on the map.
Welcome, captain Ralls.
It's so very good to see you.
To what my I ask do I owe this visit?
To our mutual weakness Mijnheer, greed.
And this well-planted map.
- It's a big surprise, isn't it?
- I'll give you credit for that.
The last time we saw each other I make a vow that the next time we met
I'd give you a surprise you never forget.
- You went to a lot of trouble.
- It will be worth it, you see Ralls...
I'm not one of those eye for an eye men.
No. I always take two eyes.
But you've got to get your hands on them first.
I got my hands on them.
So I suggest you prepare yourself for an extended visit here.
Oh, I thought I lie in here for a while, but
I can't afford to expose myself to scurvy.
So I may change my mind.
Oh, but you won't because you're my guest here.
And as my guest, I prefer that you accept my hospitality until I'm ready for you to go.
So you'll join me at dinner tomorrow night, captain?
- It will be Rijsttafel.
- Sorry, no Rijsttafel.
Can't stand curry.
That's too bad.
Perhaps you Mr. Rosen, will join me and make up in part for the captain absence.
- Is that...
- Just an old trader, Sam.
Sidneye.
Come on boys, make it fast.
- What's all the commotion?
- Well, that's fresh water, captain.
- I'll be ready soon, quick.
- Ready for what?
Ready to shove off fast as we can.
It's Ripper idea,
I think is a pretty good one.
We're not shoving off.
- We're after pearls, remember?
- The oysters can take them.
Yesterday all you want to speak was about pearls.
Well, here is where they're supposed to be.
And we're welcome to them.
- Let's get them up.
- What about Sidneye?
He ought to be getting used to having things taken from him.
Give me those glasses.
Take a look across that inlet.
What you see, Sam? Something bad, eh?
It's not good.
Looks like Ripper was right.
That fellow plays rough.
Let me grab and make a deal.
- Tell Sidneye where the gold is and get out.
- I come as far as I'm going to, Sam.
From now on, Sidneye comes to me.
- You're sure he will, eh?
- Very sure.
- He wants me more than he does that gold.
- He wants us all.
I don't think so.
What makes you so sure?
Never mind.
What you mean, never mind?
When I stand a chance of have my head ended swimming in a platter, I got the right to know why.
You're not in this thing as deep as you think you are.
- My book doesn't read that way.
- Captain, we got to get out of here, even if we had to take the boat and row a 1,000 Miles.
Well, It will be that first mile that will be the tough one, Ripper.
Joking about that isn't going to get us out of here.
Who bought that map?
- All right, it's my fault.
- Not at all.
- I just wondered if you had any plans.
- No, have you?
- One or two.
- Look...
I don't know what else besides gold is going on between you and Sidneye, but it's something.
And I'm going to find out what it is.
Maybe Sidneye will tell you, why don't you ask him?
That's what I ought to do.
- Where you going, Sam?
- To get a breath of fresh air, shove off.
You'll breathe longer here.
Come on, get those empty casks back.
- More water?
- Yeah, we'll have plenty for when we sail.
Now all we had to do is get the wind up and the gates down we are all set, eh?
You bet.
- Miola, lower away that skiff.
- Where you going, captain?
Get a breath of fresh air.
- You are Mr. Rosen?
- That's right.
- I'm Talia Van Schraeven.
- I know, I've seen you before.
- Oh, you remember?
- As though it were yesterday.
You're coming to dinner tonight, aren't you?
I've been invited.
Does that mean perhaps you won't come?
- Maybe.
- Good.
What?
Every minute you're on this island, you're in danger.
People watch every move you make.
Are you going to be there?
Why?
- Where?
- At dinner tonight.
I have no choice.
- Hello.
- Why did you come?
- Said perhaps you wouldn't.
- We changed my mind.
- You're being very foolish.
- No more than usual.
- Did you see anyone on your way here?
- Only you.
Go back, go back.
How can you be so blind?
This place is full of hate.
It's everywhere, it's reaching out at you.
And captain Ralls and your whole crew, you got to get away.
- Now, all of you.
- Through the gate?
- Gate can be lowered.
- How?
Well, we have one guest anyway.
Come in Mr. Rosen, come in.
- Are you alone, Mr. Rosen?
- All alone.
- Captain Ralls didn't care to come?
- Said he wasn't hungry.
I see. Well, evidently you are.
We shall do our best to accommodate you.
May I present my very old friend Jahrma.
This is Mr. Rosen, captain Ralls first mate.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
And Dr. Van Arkin, this is Mr. Rosen.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I believe you and Mr.
Van Schraeven have already met.
Well, I suppose captain Ralls has painted me very black to you.
He hasn't painted you any color.
Still in good form, I see. Just as well, leaves you with an open mind.
You seem to be an enterprising young man,
A man I could quite possibly use.
But to get down to cases, under the law
Mr. Rosen, you're guilty of barratry.
And I know that up here you have the location of 5 millions in gold which I want back.
Now, you may have thought that the sinking of the Red Witch was a daring and intrepid adventure,
I can understand that attitude.
It would've been mine at your age.
But Mr. Rosen, whether you're aware of it or not, you've gone into partnership with a very dangerous man, a murderer, in fact.
- A pretty strong accusation.
- It's not an accusation, young man.
A statement of fact.
Talia, more Brandy.
Yes, you're being used by Ralls for his own purposes, purposes which I shall try to make clear to you.
If I know captain Ralls, he is told you very little about himself and... as you say, nothing about me.
So...
I'm going to tell you the real reason for the sinking of the Red Witch.
And I'm not going to leave anything out.
Even though occasionally you may see me in a bad light.
Are you willing to listen?
Good.
We must go back a few years, let us say, seven.
To my first meeting with Captain Ralls.
A a peculiar meeting, say the least.
In my Younger days,
I myself had driven the Red Witch into every port in the Western Pacific.
She was the beginning of Batjak limited.
On this day we were off making Gilbert islands, due South at 172 degrees from threep.
On board, as owner, I was demonstrating to captain Younger the proper reward for breach of discipline.
I'm a strong advocate for discipline.
Here you, go back there.
If you don't want to watch, perhaps we can put you in a position where you won't see it.
Say, in his place.
- Well?
- The boy has fainted, sir.
- How many has he had?
- 16, sir.
And the penalty for speaking back to the captain?
25, sir.
Then we owe him nine, captain Younger.
Pay our debt to him.
Oh, give him the other nine, captain.
- Give him the other nine.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Man adrift.
Dead ahead.
Starboard your helm.
Glass, my glass.
Steady, steady as she goes.
Here you are, sir.
Fire a charge to drive off the sharks.
And how can a man get himself in that position?
We're off the Gilberts, Mr. Sidneye, and...
Yes, I know. That's a law that anyone who molests a Gilbertese girl gets slow death by sharks.
Have you been molesting, Mijnheer?
If you're a Gilbertese mister, you can set me adrift.
- If you're not, pull me out of here.
- Still a lot of fight left in him, eh?
All right. Bring him up.
All right, doctor.
- Fill it up.
- He's had enough.
- What's your name?
- Ralls.
- Your full name.
- Captain Ralls.
Captain Ralls?
Well...
In that case, hadn't we better extend the captain the courtesy of the ship locker, eh?
Come in.
- Good evening.
- Come in, come in Ralls, sit down.
Beautiful night out, make me wish I were back in the Gilberts.
- Now, we were just talking about you, Ralls.
- Yes?
Yes, captain Younger here seems to express some doubts that you're really the master of a vessel at all, isn't that so, captain?
That's what I said.
- Where are you bound, Mr. Sidneye?
- Papeete.
- Tell me, what did happen to your ship?
- Sunk.
- Wrecked?
- Sunk.
- As a matter of fact, I need a new one.
- Yes, I should imagine you would.
Dory should do.
Not for the cargo I'm after.
- What might that be?
- Pearls.
Pearls, captain Ralls?
As big as your eyeball, Mr. Sidneye.
Where?
- I'm no fool.
- No, of course not. But as you're a trader.
We should be able to reach some sort of agreement.
- We might.
- On what terms?
First, that you make me master of the Red Witch.
- Over my dead body.
- I'm as good as any other.
Captain Younger... would you excuse us for a short while?
Tell me... what makes you think you're a better man than Younger?
By looking at him.
How do I know you can deliver the pearls?
You don't.
Master of the Red Witch first.
- And second?
- A half-share of the pearls.
Quarter.
- You drop me at the next island.
- Oh, captain Ralls... your drink.
Ah, it's a pity, but...
I'm the victim of one of the seven deadly virtues...
Greed captain Ralls, greed.
I think we understand each other, Mr. Sidneye.
Now you can set your course for an island called Tahuta.
- I think I know it, under French mandate.
- That's right.
- Have you been there lately?
- About three months ago.
Captain Younger.
Where I lost my ship.
- To very good health, captain Ralls.
- Thank you.
You call me, Mr. Sidneye?
Oh yes, throw this man in the brig.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it personally and with pleasure.
- I hope I haven't inconvenienced you.
- Not at all.
I wanted to be sure you understood this is still my ship.
I understand all right.
Of course, it may be yours, but remember, no pearls, no ship.
- And don't forget I always keep my word.
- I heard that you do.
Now that I made everything is clear, are you ready to go ashore?
- That's Tahuta, I'll wait.
- Why?
I don't think the commissaire will be very happy to see me.
- Why? What did you do to him?
- Nothing to him.
Maybe upset his natives a little.
- Same way you did the Gilbertese?
- No. Here they were going to burn me.
How you get out of it?
- If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
- Ready to go ashore, Mr. Sidneye?
Very well, Younger.
Oh, Younger...
From now on, whether afloat or ashore, consider captain Ralls as out of your jurisdiction.
He's on a special mission for Batjak.
After you, captain.
- You're the commissaire?
- Oui. Dusset is the name.
- This is my niece Angelique.
- Mayrant Sidneye.
- Captain Younger.
- Monsieur.
I heard much of you Mr. Sidneye but
I never expected to see you on Tahata.
Oh rudder trouble. I'm afraid we shall have to infringe on your hospitality for a few days.
I should like nothing better.
And you come in a very good time there's a native festival soon.
Make my home your own, beginning with dinner tonight.
Oh, delighted.
Oh, I forgot to mention monsieur Dusset, we have another captain aboard.
- Will it be permissible to bring him too?
- But of course, I shall be delighted.
Very prompt, monsieur.
- And this is the other captain?
- Captain Ralls, monsieur Dusset and...
Mademoiselle Angelique Dusset.
Weren't here a few months ago by any chance?
- Must've been my brother.
- What was he doing here?
He was after pearls.
- That was my brother, all right.
- A remarkable resemblance.
Shall we go in?
Beautiful.
Play well, mademoiselle.
Yes, you play extremely well.
Brandy, captain Ralls?
Are there many pearls like these on the islands, monsieur?
For the natives, yes.
More Brandy, captain?
It's part of their worship.
Each month they have a great feast.
Bake one at the foot of their monolith.
Then scatter the ashes to the sea.
Pearls are kept in an iron chest in a cavern.
Which is also the home of a giant octopus.
The diver who goes to get them is a hero if he returns.
An offering to the gods if he fails.
Very violent religion.
Certainly no white man would want to tamper with those.
Captain Ralls's brother did.
- Was he successful?
- Not quite.
The natives wanted to bake him at the monolite but a providential rain came and put out the fire.
After that they started calling him the son of the gods.
I found it wise to order him from the island.
Captains Ralls's brother seems to be living a full life,
- You know him, monsieur?
- I heard of him.
Still there monsieur, just the way you left it and I intend that it stay that way.
What is it?
Perhaps captain Ralls's brother could tell you If he were here.
We come for son of gods.
Son of Taro Tahto, beloved of gods.
Maika Ino.
Your father has found you out, monsieur.
Beloved of the gods?
Those whom the gods love die young.
- You ever hear that proverb, monsieur?
- I have now.
It is wish of Wanuka that son of
Taro Tahto come with us... to place of gods.
Ehe oy?
What a strange man.
I suppose your Uncle has spoken to you about me.
Yes, monsieur.
Well?
I'm waiting for your answer.
The fact that you are waiting monsieur, is my answer.
I see.
You know what I'm prepared to offer you?
- Love, monsieur?
- Yes Angelique, love too.
Monsieur, you have many things...
Ships, men, warehouses, gold.
And now it seems you want me too.
But I'm not a ship or a warehouse, I can't be bought.
And if my name were captain Ralls?
I see.
You realize of course, that he is a dangerous man. He'll kill someday.
Monsieur, I told my Uncle I won't marry you and now I tell it to you.
I'm sorry. There's nothing more to say.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- How is the son of the gods this morning?
- Fine.
- Your parents well?
- Best of health, thank you.
I should like to meet them sometime.
- Any night.
- Oh, don't they appear in the daylight?
Not to such good advantage.
- Finding any pearls?
- Few.
Big ones?
Like this.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Kahluna.
- Is he all right?
- It's all right son, it's all right.
Come on kid, get us ashore.
I learned a great deal about you this morning.
Yes?
For one that you love children.
- Afraid to admit it?
- Too bad they have to grow up.
I, I'm sorry I joked with you about being a son of the gods.
- No reason to be. It's funny.
- But you mean a lot to these people.
Yeah, kind of childish, naive.
But this is beautiful.
That's beautiful too.
Our ship?
Ships fascinate me.
They seem so... so alive and yet just wood and iron... beams and planks... and yet someone somewhere put it together and it becomes alive.
It slides down the waves and it's a ship.
It's more than a ship.
It's a home, a world...
A breathing thing. Nothing holds it back.
The wind takes it and carries it for 10,000 miles and anyone of those Miles you're free.
Like being a bird, instead of the sky is the sea.
You have a whole empire of freedom, sea freedom.
You're alive the same way the ship is alive.
You run before the wind.
You never want to stop.
- What is it?
- Now I'm talking foolish.
Oh, I don't think so.
I think people should talk about the things they love.
Some people don't dare to love.
And so with great dignity she said to the emperor, the emperor of France, mind you...
Captain Younger, he hasn't finished.
And she said, sire, if you love me, tell me so but don't ruin my slippers.
And now I have something most exciting to tell you all.
It is with great pleasure that I announce the forthcoming marriage of my niece Angelique to my charming and unexpected guest Mr. Mayrant Sidneye.
Let us drink to their happiness.
You got to be congratulated for many reasons...
Ralls.
The son of the gods seems upset.
My little Angelique too.
You're a man of violent method, monsieur.
I would've chosen a more gentle way.
In my country monsieur... the family arrange all these affairs of the heart first.
- Should we lower away a boat, sir?
- No.
- But he might drown.
- Let him, the drunken fool.
Ralls?
Ralls.
Ralls.
Ralls.
I know what you must think of me.
The way you looked at me so, so accusingly.
But you must believe me, I knew nothing about marrying Mr. Sidneye.
Why it shocked me even more than you.
I've been looking everywhere to tell you. Oh, you frightened me.
But I'm not frightened anymore.
You don't know anything about me.
- Well, I heard things.
- Didn't Sidneye tell you where he found me?
What difference does it make where he found you?
We found each other.
Oh, it's no good.
Ralls.
A man like Ralls Mr. Rosen, an unbalanced man.
Who can say what he might do? Not I.
And I assure you I never underestimated him.
During the next few days, I sensed a brooding, dangerous tenseness.
But nothing definite.
Until at last what had been seething inside him burst through the surface.
The natives were preparing a great feast.
A feast that none of us who attended would ever forget.
It was their festival of the half-moon, the ceremony of the pearls Mr. Rosen.
Taro Tahto good.
Divers bring chosen pearl.
- Only Taro Tahto can save pearls.
- Or perhaps the son of Taro Tahto.
- Aye, son of Taro Tahto can save pearls.
- Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.
Ralls, no.
- I bet 1,000 francs he never comes up.
- I'll take that bet.
Never underestimate men like Ralls, monsieur.
- Taro Tahto good to son.
- It's hot.
His people happy.
I bring word to Wanuka.
You rest.
Come later.
It's kind of close.
- Much too close.
- Yes, yes.
- I guess the festival started.
- Ralls, what makes you do such things?
- What happens to you?
- I don't know.
Well, it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is you're still alive.
- Only that?
- That includes everything.
You? Includes you?
- I don't want to ever hurt you.
- You never will.
- I hurt everything.
- Not anymore.
- You believe that?
- I believe in you.
Something happened today in that water.
I felt myself floating up.
Got bright, were singing.
Everything dark was washed away and I couldn't look back.
Then I heard your voice...
- and you said...
- I love you, Ralls.
- That's what you said.
- That's all I ever wanted to say.
If someone had told me... one day I open my eyes and find a new world, I'd called him a liar.
But it's true, there is a new world and I found it.
- It's you.
- And you won't leave it now.
I'll never leave it now.
Look.
First the pearls, then Angelique.
All in good time, Dusset.
- Do you think we were wise in coming here?
- Something I got to do.
- What's it?
- Keep a promise that I made to a...
Friend.
Taro Tahto has spoken.
Pearls of iron chest never return to sacred cave.
They will fly over face of earth... in hands of son of Taro Tahto.
They are his to spread over world.
The gods are with us tonight, monsieur.
Taro Tahto tell us... to burn Eye of demon and spread ashes to the wind.
Here is pearl, there is chest.
Oh, the gods are strong, monsieur.
Now Ralls owns all the pearls and every year more.
The son of Taro Tahto is false.
He is a murderous scoundrel who's robbing you of your wealth.
In the name of the emperor
I place you under arrest.
Do you submit?
- For the last time Ralls.
- No.
- Oh, my God.
- No.
It is justice of gods.
It is wrath of Taro Tahto.
I kept my bargain.
So there you are, my friend.
Now you know what Ralls had never told you.
Not a very pleasant story.
I kept my part of the bargain.
I even had the charge of murder dropped.
I made him master of the Red Witch.
He got everything he wanted except the one thing he couldn't have...
Angelique.
- She never forgave him.
- Never?
I married Angelique.
Now do you think Ralls sank the Red Witch for gold alone?
No.
The reason was hate, insane and bitter.
He knew he couldn't reach me through Angelique.
So he destroyed the thing next dearest to my heart.
And you helped him Mr. Rosen.
I wonder if you excuse me, Mr. Sidneye.
I got a lot of thinking to do.
Certainly, and Mr. Rosen...
I'd like to think that eventually... you'll be on my side.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I was afraid you'd be back on the ship already.
- I got to talk to you.
- What's the matter?
Did you believe what my Uncle said tonight?
I don't know. I'm all mixed up.
- Was he lying?
- Not lying, leaving things out.
- Such as?
- The real end of the story. I...
You don't know my Uncle.
He like to pit you against Ralls, the same way he did Dusset.
Simply for his own amusement.
So he twisted the facts all out of shape.
So, I was afraid you believe him and go over to his side.
Go on, I'm listening.
Well... what he didn't tell you was that
Ralls saw Angelique again.
Twice.
The first time was nearly a year ago.
The Red Witch came into Serebaya for the first time in years... to pick up a very important cargo... gold.
I was visiting Angelique then, we were in the sewing room.
A gentleman to see you.
- Thank you Jahrma, did he give his name?
- No name.
Talia, this is captain Ralls.
My niece Talia Van Schraeven.
- It's been a long time, captain.
- Very long.
Please excuse me.
I just remember something.
- Why you come here?
- Orders.
- But to this house?
- I had...
I known for a long time that I have to.
- Angelique.
- Oh, Ralls.
- Ralls, all those years.
- Did you hate me so much?
Only at first and then it was too late.
I'll make it up.
- It's lost.
- Nothing was lost.
- We'll go away now.
- Away?
He took you from me, I'll take you from him.
- No, is not that easy, there's a child.
- Bring the child.
Oh, by all means, bring the child.
Jahrma told me you had a visitor.
I'm reminded Ralls, of the years of the locust.
Sleeps for seven then comes up out of the ground and devours everything in sight.
I should have remembered this was the seventh year and kept you underground.
Not aware, however, that the flower had been waiting for seven years to be devoured.
Ralls, please go.
I won't leave you, Mayrant.
And you should remember in whose arms you find yourself.
- Ralls, please go now.
- And leave you with him?
I'll be all right.
- Angelique, you don't owe any loyalty...
- Ralls, please.
Look to yourself, Ralls.
You made your last voyage for me.
If I ever hear that you hurt her
I'll come back and kill you.
You won't hear it.
By dark, I'll have you on the beach and drummed out of every island in the pacific.
Remember what I said.
Jahrma.
Bring Mr. Loring to me.
You destroy everything, don't you?
Everything.
Before Sidneye could stop him. That night
Ralls took the red witch on her last voyage.
I know, I signed on that night.
Now you know why he did it.
You said he saw Angelique twice.
It happened right after the sinking of the Red Witch.
Angelique was ill.
My Uncle was taken sick first. He was sick during the barratry investigation.
His will to live pulled him through.
But you can see how left him.
Angelique is different.
I remember.
Ralls disappeared for a month when we were tied up at Bali.
I don't know how she got the message to him, but she did, and he came to her.
Have you no respect?
Angelique.
You came back.
I knew you would.
I've been waiting...
Knowing that someday I look out there and
I see your ship sailing into the harbor.
The waiting is over now.
It's over.
Now we can be together always.
When you get well, I'm going to take you away from here.
To a new place, a new life.
I won't get well, Ralls.
Oh, yes, you will. You got to.
The mistakes I made...
They're not yours, Angelique, mine, all of them mine.
Ralls, don't forget me, never forget me.
Don't talk like that.
You're going to get well.
Hold me up.
I want to look at the sea again, your sea.
The hours I spent out here., watching the water and thinking of...
You love the sea.
Only you.
My darling.
Wherever you go, whatever you do,
I'll be beside you.
This isn't the end, the beginning.
Angelique, Angelique.
And now you have the whole story, all the pieces my Uncle left out.
Now you can see things as they really are.
Why didn't Sidneye hold Ralls when he had him?
Because he's not that direct, he's not that rational anymore.
The trouble he went to to get Ralls here wasn't the act of a rational man.
I don't know.
He seems to see himself as a kind of spider with this island as a web.
- He didn't love Angelique.
- No, but he owned her.
And that to my Uncle is more than love.
Possession is the only thing he understands.
Ralls knows that. That's why he took the gold, to save himself.
Ralls was right.
Looks like the one wrong thing in the sea was me.
But you don't have to continue to be.
What do you think will happen now?
My Uncle will kill him if he doesn't get away.
You said the gate could be lowered?
- Yes.
- When?
Tonight, I think.
- Could you go out tonight?
- You can get the gate down?
Go back to the ship and wait.
If I can do it, I'll let you know.
I'd better be getting back, they'll be looking for me.
- Talia.
- Yes?
You won't get in trouble, will you?
I mean I wouldn't want anything to happen to you because of...
I'll be all right.
She must tell a pretty good story.
Ralls, it's your fight, yours and Sidneye's.
It's a personal matter and I don't belong in it.
If I had the facts before
I went into this thing I... wouldn't have gone in, in the first place.
I hope you win, but you'll have to do it without me.
It's a bad business all around.
If I got to get mixed up in a feud it will be my own, not somebody else.
I realize tonight that
I have a life to live too.
- All right, Sam.
- You'll take her out?
Just the way you want it.
Make you happy?
It's better that way.
Ripper, it looks like you're going to be richer than you expected.
Yeah, just so I ain't deader.
- I was worried.
- So was I for a while.
- That means everything is set?
- Yes.
- We're going to sail for sure now, captain?
- Get forward and make ready.
That girl, is an angel.
Don't go.
I got to go. But I'll come back, Talia.
I'll come back. I love you.
Don't go away.
- Don't leave me.
- I made a bargain.
I got to see Ralls out of here. I owe him that.
You owe Ralls nothing.
If you go with him my Uncle will hunt you both until death.
You'll never be free as long you're with Ralls.
You'll be running for the rest of your life and for what? The gold.
You said you loved me.
Don't let anything or anybody destroy what we found.
I don't want to be another Angelique.
I'm sorry, Sam.
It's just that...
All right, it's time.
Ripper.
Cast off.
Stay with her, Sam.
Tell Sidneye where the gold is but stay with her.
I told you to disable the ship not blow it to
Kingdom Come, you fool, you stupid idiot.
You'll live to regret this day if you live. Now, get out of my sight.
And you, yes.
Both of you.
Thought I was stupid enough to rely on the gate alone, didn't you?
Stumbling blindly ahead, destroying the work of years.
Now you killed Ralls, I didn't do it.
You did. You, you.
You wanted him dead.
In my own time, my own way.
A man can be alive and still be dead.
Alive, Ralls meant something to me, something you wouldn't understand.
- Now, if you were my daughter...
- If I were,
I would've done the same thing.
Where is the Red Witch?
When you blew up the Melbourne queen you blew your last chance of ever finding the witch.
I don't care how you thought of Ralls, or how much you hated him.
If he went bad was as much your fault than his own, you've been hounding him for years.
Now he is gone.
He is off your hook, Sidneye.
- And so is the Red Witch.
- That's a pretty speech Sam, I love you too.
That one of your little brown brothers that tried to finish the job.
- What about Ripper?
- He is on the beach.
You can scare him, but you can't kill him.
Ralls?
- Sidneye, you owe me a ship.
- Really?
I should say we're even in the matter of ships.
The only thing that doesn't balance is the matter of money.
Balances in my books.
But the books you're using now are mine.
So I was on the point of persuading Rosen here to divulge the location of the witch.
- Why don't you try to persuade me?
- That will be even more interesting.
- Now I'm willing to bargain.
- Bargain? You?
- Mayrant.
- Yes, yes, what's it?
- Captain Younger is outside.
- Oh, he is.
He has captain Munsey with him.
- Munsey?
- See what I mean?
Oh, captain Munsey.
Well, well, you honor us, sir.
Actually, I'm not here on pleasure.
- He followed us from Serebaya, sir.
- Really? Why? What's on your mind, captain?
I intend to put you and all your associates in a cell at Larangua.
And I won't hesitate a moment if the circumstances warrant it.
Well then, I can't say I should be sorry to see you disappointed.
This time I may not be, a ship was blown up tonight just outside the lagoon.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, there was.
I was her master.
Oh, then the vessel was the Melbourne queen.
That's right.
What happened?
Both Mr. Rosen and I put into the lagoon here a few days ago to mend sail and repair ship.
- Mr Sidneye was kind enough to entertain us.
- Yes.
In return, we accepted a cargo of dynamite for Serebaya.
We sailed tonight to take advantage of the tide with the help of flares to get through the reef.
All of a sudden it happened, that's all there's to it.
The dynamite was left over from cargo brought in to widen the lagoon.
You'll find it declared in the records at Larangua.
Very strange wasn't it, that you should choose this particular lagoon?
I was under the impression there was bad blood between you and Mr. Sidneye.
Oh, no.
You know, if there was bad blood between us, would I have put in here in the first place?
As my guest captain Munsey, your visit is most welcome.
But as a meddlesome official, no.
That's most unfortunate... because I shall no doubt, visit you again as a meddlesome official.
As it stands, I shall enter what has been told me... in my report.
Captain Munsey,
I'll walk to the gate with you.
- Mayrant, I don't like this.
- Ralls is planning something.
Mr. Sidneye, if I mix with Ralls again, I'll kill him.
Of course he is planning something.
Mayrant you know that man is not to be trusted, you must do something.
- Yeah, before it's too late.
- My colleagues...
What a miserable, sniveling lot Ralls has made of you, every one of you.
Babbling like a lot of idiots.
Turn back to the window and keep your eyes on a man.
Ralls lives.
He makes every day of living a challenge.
Beside him, you're all decadent.
Dead.
Ralls, I didn't believe a word you said in there.
I didn't think you would.
- I mean to investigate this thing thoroughly.
- I might be of some help to you.
Oh?
We'll be off Dopple reef tomorrow around 2:00, you might learn... something of interest about the Red Witch and a few other things.
Such as what happened here tonight?
Well, I be off Dopple reef tomorrow around 2:00.
- And where will you and Mr. Sidneye be?
- Oh, we'll be there.
- In that event, I'll wait and sail with you.
- Oh, no.
Sidneye will never set sail from this lagoon as long as you're standing by.
I see.
Very well, Ralls.
But remember, if you fail me...
- I'll be back.
- That I'm depending on.
Nice fellow, Munsey.
Well, Sidneye, I'm ready to bargain.
- Your bargaining power is on its way to sea.
- That's right, to the Red Witch.
- You gave Munsey the position of the witch?
- False position.
Munsey is expecting us tomorrow at Dopple reef, when we don't show up, he'll be back.
Looking for you.
When I tell him a little different story on the Melbourne queen, he'll be looking for both of us.
You have 24 hours to get the gold.
- Can we make it?
- If we can make a deal.
Well, that depends. What's it?
- Half the gold and the three of us go free.
- Ah, no.
They will go free with part of the gold, but you and I have something to settle.
Done.
- Younger, get ready to sail as soon as you can.
- Yes, sir.
Ralls.
What are you doing? You had a way out to safe out with Munsey and you let them go.
Want to spend part of that 5 million, Sam.
What's the matter, man?
Mr. Sidneye, that ship is hanging over the edge of the world down there.
Her bow is on a reef and her stern is hanging over 1,000 fathoms of nothing.
- You mean you're afraid?
- Yes, sir, I am.
She's rolling down there something terrible.
You got to go.
I'll double your wages, triple them..
I wouldn't go down there again for all the gold that's ever been sunk.
Neither would I. I got a wife and kids.
If I had my way, I send Ralls over the side.
If I had to put him in chains to do it.
I go down there for it was worthwhile.
You should be made to go down.
That gold is there because of you,
Mayrant should force you to bring it back.
He is a sick man because of you.
You made us all suffer.
You should be made to pay whether the gold is recovered or not.
I'll said I go if they made it worth my while.
I wouldn't give you one penny.
I'll make it worth your while.
I believe you would.
- What's happened?
- Ralls is going after the gold.
- What the matter with the divers?
- A little family trouble.
Take that exhaust valve.
Well Sam, here we are right back where we started.
You got what you wanted.
Now I'm going to get what I want.
All right, jacks.
You be careful, captain.
Red witch don't like you no more.
Feed out the line.
More slack. More slack.
Speed up the pump.
Lower the basket.
The basket, bring up the basket.
- He is in trouble.
- No, no. He mustn't be in trouble.
- She's fighting him.
- Shut up.
He is in trouble, bring him up.
She's got him.
Ralls.
Ralls.
She was waiting for him all this time.
Ralls has gotten what he wanted, Sam.
Wherever you go, whatever you do,
I'll be beside you.
This isn't the end, is the beginning.

Komdala!
What have you stolen this time, Cheetah?
Here. Hand it to me, Cheetah.
Cigarette case.
A wallet. Steely things to find here in the jungle.
Very odd.
Writing inside.
"To Gloria. Success."
"October 1928. Douglas."
Cheetah, where did you find the cigarette case?
Well, ask him, where he found it!
What is this, Cheeta?
Tarzan, I found out where the cigarette case came from and who it belonged to!
It belonged to Gloria James!
She was a famous flyer.
I was just a little girl, but... but I remember it!
She and her co-pilot left London on around the world flight.
They were never heard from again.
Listen.
"Flying through storm."
"Icing conditions at 12,000 feet."
"Losing altitude rapidly."
"Trying to persuade Graham to jump with me,"
"but he prefers to take his chances with the plane."
"Perhaps it's better."
"One of us might get through."
Rest of this is just blank pages.
Tomorrow you must take this to the trading post in Nyaga, and have them send it to England.
Better throw book in river.
Why?
This is proof of what happened to her.
What difference that make now?
Oh, there must be relatives and friends still alive in England.
This book belongs to them.
Some things better left alone.
You mean, you won't take it?
No.
Would you please tell me, why?
No.
All right.
Cheetah, stay.
Take care of Jane.
Get it outta here!
Glad to see you, Tarzan.
What brings you here?
Book.
Where did you get this?
In jungle.
The government has spent 20 years and 10,000 pounds trying to find this woman.
What woman?
Named Gloria James.
Gloria James?
Excuse me.
Trying to hold on at me?
I don't know what you mean.
No? There was a reward of a 1000 pounds to offer, dead or alive.
Might still be good.
I never heard of it.
And 5,000 more from a guy named Jessup if she were found alive. Remember?
Never heard of him either.
That's funny. It was hashed all over the newspapers, time and time again.
Jessup said this James woman was the only one who could clear him of a murder charge.
He's serving a life sentence.
You say this woman can get man out of jail?
She could if she were alive.
But she's dead.
Too bad, isn't it, Dodd?
Yeah.
To set it out for 20 years, and then find out one chance for freedom?
She's dead.
You send book to England?
Don't worry. We'll send it.
-- Won't we, Dodd?
-- Yeah.
I go.
So long.
When you send book...
...say, maybe...
...Gloria James not dead.
What do you think he means by that?
Search me.
But it's 50-50.
Hey, Trask?
Aha.
If a man's freedom depends on Gloria's presence, she may go.
But she must keep secret all she has known here.
Blue Valley will be trenched with blood because of this.
Obey the judgement of the High One, Pasco!
Tarzan shall not take this woman away!
Do not interfere, you have not the right.
Stop him!
Do not shoot!
Tarzan and the woman must not leave!
We we told to let them pass.
Tarzan has a pass to by the High One.
They go free.
Darling, I have been so worried about you.
Good.
Never go away anymore.
Thank you.
Who is here?
Who is she?
Gloria James. Lost flyer.
Gloria James?
Oh, you're playing a joke on me.
Hello.
Of course you're Jane.
Yes.
And you are?
Didn't Tarzan tell you?
I'm Gloria James.
Gloria James's plane crashed 20 years ago!
She'd be close to 50 years old now.
That's right.
Well...
If you're 50, I'll...
I'll eat Cheetah! Raw!
But I can't understand this: if you are Gloria James, then... why have you waited 20 years before you put in an appearance?
Live deep in jungle.
Only Tarzan know the way there.
Well, if you knew where she was, then... why didn't you show her the way out before?
Well...
Tarzan learned that I could free a man who's been in prison for 20 years.
Otherwise I never would have come back.
But from where?
Where have you been?
How could you live here in the jungle?
Getting late.
Tarzan, where has she been?
How can she look so young?
Soon she will not look young.
She will grow old quickly now.
We leave early in morning to Nyaga.
What do you think of Gloria James?
Phony.
I talked to her.
She knows all about flying...
...up to 20 years ago.
I've known women who were 50 and said they were 25, but I've never heard of a woman who was 25 and said she was 50.
Did you hear the story of the people living in the jungle and never seem to grow old?
I've heard a lot of wild tales about the jungle.
Should be there... something to eat or drink, that keeps them looking young?
You ask me to believe these fairy tales?
You know, if it were true, there'd be a fortune on that stuff, whatever it is.
Huh?
I know it's all a secret, but...
I'm still dying of curiosity.
Naturally.
20 years is a long time to explain away.
What are you going to tell them?
Nothing.
To be honest with you, I...
I'm frightened to death.
Anyway, I'll file a claim whatever it was when I get to Nairobi.
We'll see what happens.
In both our names.
Oh, of course!
Now it's time to take off.
If you hurry, miss James, you might still make it to the car plane to Nairobi.
Oh, I'm ready.
Good bye, Jane.
Good bye and lots of luck.
I'm giving you men, guns, and supplies.
You realize the risk that I'm taking with my money?
All I risk is my life.
There is no woman anywhere in the world that wouldn't pay any price to remain young.
Find it, and you'll be a millionaire.
You gotta get back to be a millionaire.
The going will be tough, but remember, what it's worth to you.
We still deal 50-50?
After expenses.
Good luck.
Wish me luck. I'll need it.
So...
...you do believe in fairy tales?
Well, aren't you gonna walk on my back,
Trask?
So far, so good, huh?
Yep. From here it's anybody's guest.
For 30 years I've explored every foot of this jungle.
It's gotta be in those mountains.
Make ready.
Only Tarzan knows the way here.
He must be destroyed.
I will go.
I will kill him.
Good girl, Cheetah.
Packages.
Magazines.
And letters!
This is for you, Cheetah.
A letter from Gloria!
Douglas Jessup is free!
And then they married!
Listen to this, Tarzan.
"I'm trying to persuade Douglas to return to Africa with me."
"Tarzan will understand."
"We want him to guide us back again to the Blue Valley."
The Blue Valley...
We saw it once, remember?
You will guide them back, won't you?
No!
A way there is secret.
But... I...
There's something that'll interest you.
A radio message from Gloria James.
She wants me to meet her in Nairobi and fly her to Tarzan's place.
She's got a husband with her now.
What's she coming back to Africa for?
You're asking me?
What would a woman come back for?
Sure. To keep young.
This means she wants Tarzan to guide her to that place, whatever it is.
You've got it.
No news of Vredak?
Not a word.
You know how I always say:
You want a thing done well, do it yourself.
Uhu.
Tarzan?
Same question again?
You tried to kill me! Why?
Why?
You don't keep secret.
You tell people a way to our valley.
Tarzan tell no one.
But people come. We killed them.
We kill you, too!
Tell your people Tarzan is their friend.
Tarzan your friend, too.
Go. Go!
Maybe it's Gloria. Come on, Cheetah.
They are landing.
Mr. Trask.
Hey, Mr. Dodd.
-- Surprised?
-- Yeah.
Well, we've got another surprise for you.
Jane.
Gloria...
Jane, darling.
This is my husband Douglas.
This is Jane.
-- Jane.
-- How do you do?
I really feel we don't need an introduction.
Dodd has some work to do on the plane before we go back.
Is it all right if we put a camp for tonight?
Why, certainly.
Thanks.
Tarzan will be back soon.
Shall we go to the house?
All right.
You were shocked when you saw me, weren't you?
I was already old when I reached London.
It's one thing to grow old gracefully, year by year, but...
I aged almost overnight.
I haven't told Douglas anything.
I made up my mind to return when we were married.
I felt that... but he was...
We were both entitled to the years we'd lost.
Tarzan will take us back.
Won't he?
I'll make him.
You and Douglas have the right to go back.
Match!
Meat.
Pepper.
Thank you.
You told me Cheetah is a smart monkey, but I didn't know she was that smart.
Cheetah isn't a monkey, darling.
She's a chimpanzee.
Oh. My african education is beginning.
Tarzan's coming.
Tarzan! Gloria and Douglas Jessup are here.
Dodd and Trask flew them in from Nyaga today.
Trask?
Dodd?
Yes. Come to meet Douglas.
Tarzan, are you going to be stubborn?
Tarzan, you must listen.
We go fishing, Cheetah.
But you can't go fishing!
Douglas and Gloria are depending on you!
Come, Cheetah. We go fishing!
Oh... you...
You!
You know, when... when Gloria suggested this trip, I was a little doubtful.
Oh, I wanted to see the place she'd live in, and the natives that'd be so kind to her.
Well, now I understand.
This is a wonderful country.
Mr. Jessup... huh...
Eh... just where is this place?
Oh, somewhere in the interior.
Tarzan knows a way there.
Oh, we're out of luck, Trask.
No flying for us until I can replace this part.
You mean, we're stuck here?
Yeah, it looks like it.
Unless eh... if it's on the way, maybe
Tarzan'll take us along until we can go straight off to Nyaga.
Tarzan take no one.
Gloria and man have made mistake.
Gloria and I have traveled thousands of miles.
I go.
Tarzan.
Tarzan!
He's gone.
I'll guide you.
I know the jungle, and I know the way to the Blue Valley.
Cheetah.
You help me teach Jane big lesson?
Tarzan follow.
Don't tell Jane.
We'll camp here.
Getting too dark to go on.
But I still insist, it's a great country.
Chimp scared the daylights out of me.
When we run into the lions...
You know, Dodd, that's not a least bit funny.
Lesson number one. Good one!
What's the matter? A lion?
No! Ants!
Ants...
-- Ants?
-- No, a lion!
Mr. Trask?
Are you familiar with this part of the jungle?
Lost?
No.
But I believe we've missed the trail to Nyaga.
You didn't expect us to leave you, did you?
But I can't take you.
Why not? We'll help you get through.
What's so mysterious about this Blue Valley anyway?
Mysterious?
Why wouldn't Tarzan guide us?
Don't you suppose Tarzan could be a little jealous of his knowledge of jungle trails?
Wants to keep the whole jungle to himself, huh?
But one thing is certain: if we don't find some water, we're gonna be pretty thirsty.
Hey!
We found water!
Cheetah!
Cheetah!
Cheetah!
Is the water all right?
Not set to drink...
Look at this.
Not food either.
I'm sorry I got you into all this.
Nobody's blaming you, Jane.
I'm sure we'll get through, all right?
You think so?
With that chimp passing on our food and water and turning it all down?
Where's Jane?
I wonder where we are.
Up a crick as usual.
We gotta get out of here!
Tarzan.
Still cold?
Not anymore.
Tarzan, I'm so glad you came.
I never should have stayed in that ravine after the rain started.
Jane know better next time.
We go back in the morning.
But Tarzan... we've come so far!
Can't you...
I'm sorry, Gloria.
We go back in morning.
Where's Tarzan?
I was just looking for him myself.
Dodd! Wake up!
Huh?
We've been double crossed. Tarzan's gone.
We lost two honey-moons.
Cheetah.
Follow Tarzan.
No, Cheetah.
Cheetah and I will go back.
If you think anything, that champ will change your mind.
Dodd and I know what's in that place, and we're going to get there.
This man Vredak.
Oh it's horrible.
People of Valley maybe not friendly now.
We'll go on.
Make ready.
It's Tarzan!
She can't be the same one.
You will know who she is when you hear her speak.
Her skin is wrinkled and the hair is gray.
In the outside world all grow old.
You'll remain here until the High One passes his judgement upon you.
Death to Tarzan!
-- Death to all betrayers!
-- Kill Them!
Gloria and her man want to stay.
Never leave again.
Yes.
Forever.
I wish I could welcome you more graciously, my friends.
But I have had to deal with fear.
A fear that has entered the hearts and minds of my people.
This fear... because their secret has been taken out to the world, and trespassers have attempted to conquer us.
I say again, it was Tarzan who betrayed us.
But the High One has welcomed them all.
Tarzan has deceived the High One.
Siko and I will avenge this betrayer tonight. if the way to our valley is dark, it is not so easily found.
One needs his eyes to see.
His eyes?
His eyes.
We must find Tarzan, Cheetah.
Are you keeping track of where we are?
Yeah.
We've been traveling south-south-east.
This country will be a sench to spot from the air.
The man, the woman and Tarzan have been freed by the High One.
-- Freed?
-- Yes.
The man and woman shall remain with us.
But henceforth no one may enter or leave the valley.
I see that you are impressed.
Deeply impressed.
The potency of the water is lost once it has touched the ground.
That is why it is taken from the spring.
The waters have the power to restore youth, and heal the sick.
We have kept its existence in secret from the outside world.
Lest the greediest war men to come for us and exploit our treasure.
Lilisa, bring a vial of the water, that our friends may envigorate themselves after their wears on the journey.
Dwell amongst us as one of our people.
Thank you, ma'am.
This is as far as they got.
You will be freed in time, but our secret will be safe.
To find a way here one must be able to see.
Heat it for that's right there.
Hurry, Cheetah!
More strangers.
Mr. Trask!
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Cheetah!
Cheetah!
Don't tease me, Tarzan.
What made Gloria James stay so young?
Cheetah has present for you.
Give me that, Cheetah.
Cheetah...
Cheetah!
Cheetah...
The End.

Attention, flight "a"!
Flight "a"!
Japanese aircraft sighted over Kunsing area.
Aggie blue from Aggie blue one.
Go ahead.
- Blue two okay, skipper.
- Blue three, check.
Blue four receiving you r5-s5, sir.
- Blue five, okay.
- Blue six, okay.
Eighteen attack bombers, three points to your right. Altitude about 15,000.
What do you know, only three to one. That won't even wake me up.
- Gordon to dale, over.
- Go ahead, sir.
Listen, dale, this is your first time up.
Don't try to win this war all by yourself.
- Stick close. Tail them in formation.
- Yes, sir.
What time is it?
- Look like those boozers are overdue.
- All safe and accounted for?
- Of course.
Of course.
Look, captain Jim!
Looky! Wham, wham!
Termites.
Better get a new oxygen tank.
She only registers 500.
Hap.
- You got something on your mind?
- Me?
Nothing but japs.
Why?
- You're not pulling out of your dives fast enough. - Oh?
I'll watch it.
- It only takes one.
- I know, Jim.
Hate to look around one day and find out you're the little man who wasn't there.
You and Reardon better go up this afternoon and simulate diving attack.
Mustn't get rusty.
Okay, Jim.
A little rough in spots, Dale, but I think when you iron a few things out-
Dale?
Dale?
Bill, take care of Dale.
Mike?
Yes, sir? Did that box of instruments come up from Rangoon?
Yes, sir.
Fix the panel in Dale's ship.
This belonged to Dale too.
Come in.
Quite a collection.
He should have stayed in college where he came from, but he begged for a chance.
Begged for it like some kid asking to go to the circus, and I gave it to him.
What happened?
He didn't watch his tail.
And outnumbered, as usual.
He did bring his ship back.
Yeah... He did.
But tomorrow or the next day, there will be somebody else in it...
With three of them on his tail.
- Or six or ten
- Jim.
- How's Miller?
- Just a flesh wound in the shoulder.
I'll give him back to you in a week.
How are you?
You can have me back anytime.
Why don't you go home?
You need a nurse.
Suppose you cut yourself shaving?
When did you sleep last?
Monday. It was a very good day for it.
Well, try thursdays. They're good days too. Excuse me.
Larry?
Get me the weather on M5, and check on those oil drums.
Find out what's holding them up.
As if I didn't already know.
- Think Hap could run this show for a couple of days? - Yes. Why?
I've got to run down to Rangoon. The colonel promised me some replacements.
- I'm gonna need them now that Dale..
- When will you be back?
Oh, I don't know.
Might keep right on going till I get to San Francisco.
Nice town, San Francisco.
Yeah.
There's a place on Fisherman's Wharf-
They serve oysters you have to cut with a knife.
Ever try Simpsons in London?
Roast beef you can cut with a fork.
No floor show though.
No floor show.
Take me with you.
No, Brooke, we can't do anything like that.
I know. I couldn't leave anyway.
There's a new batch of evacuee children coming this afternoon.
Wanted to see me, Jim?
Yeah, I want you to take care of the store while I'm away.
- Got to go to Rangoon.
- Sure.
Larry, have the station wagon brought around and put my things in it.
Got to catch a plane for Rangoon.
Did that gasoline shipment arrive yet?
I wish somebody would figure out a ship that would fly on rice.
Want to check the scoreboard?
Mccurdy will fly number two while you're in charge.
Make sure that second-string pitcher does some work on his guns.
Jim: Zero. Hap: Zero
Hap: Two
I thought you and Jim-
Didn't I tell you to credit my ship only to Dale?
Look, Jim, I got nobody back in the states.
I thought Dale's folks would find that
$1,000 bonus handy around the farm.
Or is it a gas station?
You got your halo on crooked, pal.
- Car's ready.
- Right.
Start working on Selby and Mcintosh as a team.
- I think they're about ready.
- Okay, Jim.
Don't worry about a thing. I'll take care of things while you're away.
Okay. And no gin rummy with Brooke.
- She's my pigeon. Bye, pigeon.
- Good-bye.
What do you see in that guy?
San Francisco.
Huh? never mind.
Any more on flight 8 from Hong Kong?
The airport informs me the plane has been delayed. The storm, you know.
Oh, there were two gentlemen here expecting me.
I believe they just came in.
You'll find them in the cocktail lounge with mrs. Bales.
Mrs. Bales?
- If anything more comes in on that plane, let me know. - Yes, sir.
Squadron leader Gordon, I'm lieutenant Barton. How are you?
- Hello, Blackie.
- Hello, Jim. My wife, Jim.
How do you do?
What are you doing here, Blackie?
I heard you needed pilots, and I needed the job.
I didn't know at the time that you were head man.
I'll run upstairs and pack.
- Excuse me. - Train leaves for
Lai Chau at 6:00 in the morning.
- Be on it.
- Yes, sir.
She knows, jim.
I hate to turn you down, Blackie but I've got to.
Look, Jim, I don't want to put this on a personal basis,
But you know me, you know my work.
- I'm a good flier, Jim.
- I know you are.
You could work for me anytime. We get along, but-
I haven't been on that stuff for a long time, Jim. Honest. That's just soda pop.
It isn't that. I'm trying to hold on to a fine bunch of men.
It isn't always easy to keep peace in the family.
Some of them would remember that Lefty Matson case.
- But, Jim, I was cleared of that.
- I know.
The army gave you a clean bill of health,
But you'd be flying with a lot of men that knew Lefty.
I'm really doing Blackie a favor, mrs. Bales.
I don't want any favors. I just want a chance to get back on my feet again.
This is the last outpost for me, Jim.
Oh, it just wouldn't work out. I'm sorry.
Good-bye, mrs. Bales,
Blackie.
Any news yet? No, sir. Not yet.
Oh Mr. Gordon, I made some excuse so I could talk to you.
No matter what happens, please don't ever tell Blackie that I did.
Of course.
Mr. Gordon, I hate to butt in like this,
But you've got to give him another chance to fly.
Mrs. Bales, I can't jeopardize the morale of an entire squadron...
Just to give your husband a job.
But it isn't just a job. Though we need the money, it's something more.
I married him right after that happened.
He told me the whole story.
I thought I could make it up to him, but I can't.
There's some things that even a wife can't do for the man she loves.
He's got to find it himself...
Doing the things he loves best,
Even if means paying with his life.
It isn't easy for me to say no. You don't know what you're asking me to do.
Oh, I do.
Do you know what losing your self-respect means?
That's what's happened to him.
I know.
I live with him.
I've caught him looking out of a window, watching a plane.
Watching it till he couldn't see it any more.
Afraid to turn around and look me in the face.
- Mrs. Bales... - Mr. Gordon, you know men.
You command a squadron.
You've seen them die.
Some of them go out smiling.
Have you ever seen the look on a man's face...
When you tell him he can't fly anymore?
No.
It's a living death, mr. Gordon. I know.
Please don't say any more.
I'd rather he went with you and took what came...
Than to live with him the rest of his life...
Watching him die a little every day.
Have him on that train tomorrow morning.
Thanks.
You can't go with him, you know.
Yes, I know.
And please don't ever tell Blackie I spoke to you.
I just received news for that plane from Hong Kong, sir.
It was attacked and fired upon by a japanese fighter squadron.
- Is it down? - No, sir. It's coming in on one wing and a prayer.
- Get me a cab.
- Yes, sir.
Rangoon calling again, Woody.
Jason, flight 8. Go ahead,
Rangoon. What do you want now?
Am I gonna bring the plane in? No, you dope!
I'm gonna park it up here on the clouds and wait till the storm blows over!
We did everything to cover your landing, Jason.
Fire and crash trucks are standing by.
- Bring her down easy.
- "easy"?
Rangoon calling Jason, flight 8.
What's your position?
My instruments tell me
I'm flying upside-down...
5,000 feet below Lake Michigan.
But I must be wrong because I can see the lights of the field.
Head for cover.
I'm coming in!
I can't see them, mr. Raffkin.
Bring that mike outside.
Lower the landing gear,
Alabama.
If he walks away from this, he's a miracle man.
Pull up, Woody!
You're coming in on one wheel!
- thanks.
- Woody, this is Jim Gordon.
- Jim? What are you doing up so late, pappy?
- Never mind that.
The runway at the north end of the field is mud and water.
Your only chance is to get that wheel up and skid in on your belly, but watch the wind.
Stop worrying, pappy. Just get that mob out of the way...
Or somebody will get a hot engine in their lap.
Pull up that landing gear.
You're gonna spill, Woody!
You're coming in crosswind!
Mm-mmm.
Good ol' real estate!
- Jim! - Woody! -
What do you say, pappy?
Nice landing.
- Did you like it?
- Why, you lucky-
- What do you mean, "lucky"?
- Coming in crosswind.
Why not? I wanted the wind to blow the fire away from the cabin.
Meet my better half while he's still awake. This is Alabama Smith.
- This is captain Jim Gordon of the Flying Tigers. - How are you?
That's enough. Jason, that was magnificent!
Save it. I'm gonna find a promotion for you.
Listen, you can take my job, the
Rangoon Airways, the Burmese... and the rest of this cockeyed country and give it back to Marco Polo!
- Chop, chop.
- But mr. Jason-
I didn't sign on to be a target for a bunch of four-eyed japs!
- You're not resigning?
- No, I'm quitting, definitely and for good.
And me too.
And forward mr. Jason's mail to Kunsing airfield.
Thank you very much, mr. Raffkin.
Here comes the replacements.
Take these men over to barracks.
- What's this thing?
- Headquarters.
It looks like the Taj
Mahal with a hangover.
What's that?
The milk bar?
No, the barracks. Pick out a cot with four legs if you can find one.
Dump your stuff and report back to me at the hangar.
What hangar?
That's a hangar? I like the green roof, but isn't it drafty?
I didn't promise you
La Guardia airport.
Look, pappy, if I'd have known this,
I wouldn't have come out here for $612 a month.
How did you get mixed up in this anyway?
- You never used to like chop suey.
- You'll find out.
Get yourself all set, and I'll see you later.
Okay, pappy.
Say! What are those things you wear on your backs, laundry tickets?
No, in case you're forced down in chinese territory,
They'll know you're an american volunteer.
What if you're forced down in enemy territory?
Then you've got nothing to worry about.
- You all set, Woody?
- Well. the red carpet's a little threadbare,
The brass band's a little out of tune,
But outside of that,
I'm all set.
Would you like the blue or the pink bridal suite, sir?
The blue comes with a sunken tub.
What did you expect, the La Guardia airport?
Huh?
Drop this off for me, will you?
I've got to make a reconnaissance.
I'm getting that old feeling.
Jim, is that you?
I won't be a minute.
I'm just finishing a bath.
Be right out.
How is Rangoon?
Did you have fun?
How many replacements did you bring back?
You would come back just when I was stealing a bath.
Then, of course, the boiler went burst and the water ran out-
Oh, hello.
- Jim Gordon with you?
- Won't I do?
Say, tell me something.
You always use Jim's tub?
- Yes, we all do.
- Cozy.
It happens to be the only bathtub in Kunsing.
I see. It must be a very chummy spot on Saturday night.
Do you sing and dance too or is your act limited to patter?
Oh, fine, fine.
You're one of the new replacements, aren't you?
Oh, no, not one of the replacements.
Jim told me he was having a little trouble out here,
So I thought
I'd give him a hand.
And I think
I'm going to like it.
I'm so glad.
If there's anything we can do to make you comfortable, don't hesitate to call on us.
Oh, I will, I will.
How about dinner?
Sorry.
I never get quite that hungry.
Oh, and if you should use the tub, you'll be sure and empty it, won't you?
We've no plumbing.
So sorry.
- What happened to that one?
- I overshot the field yesterday.
Came in a little too high,
I guess.
- I'll watch it.
- Jim!
- Brooke! Been behaving yourself?
- Mm-hmm.
No, she hasn't. She's been taking me at gin rummy since you left.
Oh, Woody.
- Miss Elliott, mr. Jason.
- We've met.
What do you think of glamour boy?
He's a difficult man to get to know. So shy.
Anybody in my spot would have done the same thing.
Hap Davis,
Woody Jason.
- Glad to have you with us, Jason.
- Thank you, Hap.
I'm gonna put him in your hands, Hap.
I don't need a nurse.
I've already got one.
- If you'll excuse me, I have to go on duty.
- Won't you wish me luck?
You don't really need it, do you?
- Did I do something wrong?
- Do you ever do anything right?
Pappy, why don't you stop picking on me?
Come on. I'll introduce you to the rest of the fellas.
I don't like to point, chum, but she happens to be the skipper's girl.
- Great. She's got a sense of humor, hasn't she? - We all have.
In fact, we wake up two or three times a night, laugh and go back to sleep.
I would have hated to have been in that burning plane with anybody else but Woody.
You don't have to sell Jason to us. We know he's got a good record.
But out here, everybody starts even.
Oh, yeah.
Does that go for me too?
Sure.
Sure, it does.
Thanks, fellas.
Thanks.
- Selby.
- Yeah?
- I got your 30 pasted together.
- Okay.
We're not sticklers for discipline here, Woody, but we expect results.
Relax.
- Gentlemen, this is Woody Jason.
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi, Woody.
- His bark is worse than his bite.
Shake hands and count your fingers.
- I'm Mccurdy from Brooklyn.
- How are you, Brooklyn?
You ever know a little girl by the name of Sally Eray?
No, you wouldn't.
You're not her type.
- My name's Norton. I'm from
- Don't tell me. I know.
A state of beautiful women. You ever know the Mcdott sisters from Fort Worth?
- I'm from Dallas.
- Oh.
Reardon, Maine. I don't think you'd know anybody I'd know. now, there's where you're wrong. I knew a redheaded girl by the name-
Selby, Michigan. Selby mi-
Hello, Michigan.
What a football team.
- I used to date a little... what do you call those? - Majorette.
Yeah, a majorette.
What a football team.
- My name's Mcintosh.
- How are you, Mac?
I come from nowhere.
You got a girl there?
Uh-
Bentley's that gal's name.
A tall brunette with a p-40 figure and plenty of armor.
- Boy, I can't wait till I get back.
- "Back"?
Yeah, you don't think I'm gonna make this my life's work, do you?
Give him time, boys.
He'll catch there's a war on.
I know there's a war, but you fellows have no part of it.
We're all out here for the same reason.
Dough.
Sure, that we are, but it's good to know every check you cash in... means a jap's cashed in too.
Wait a minute, fellas. We're all making the same salary:
600 bucks a month and 500 a jap, right?
Back home most of us would kill rattlesnakes whether there was a bounty on them or not.
I know, but you're protecting your own home. This is not our home.
It's not our fight. It's a business.
And boy I hope business is good.
- What's the matter with him?
- His brother crashed behind enemy lines.
We found him after the japs got through with him.
- I didn't mean anything personal
- We know you didn't, Woody.
- Let's take a walk.
- Yeah, but-
Get down!
- Tails up!
- Let's go.
- Come on, Alabama!
- Where are we going?
The bank's open!
- Is anybody hurt?
- Not yet.
- Which one do I take? - Are you crazy?
Wait till you get combat training.
"Training"? Me?
I'm losing dough!
And I'm running this outfit! Get back!
1,500 smackers up there, and that guy cuts me off!
- There's a shelter at the first aid.
- What are we waiting for?
I don't know, but I came out here to fly.
Hey, Woody!
That ain't the way!
Stop, stop!
No! No!
Come back here!
- Smart fellow taking plane. No bullets!
- No ammunition? what?
No got-
- Contact him by radio.
- Him no take earphone.
- Let's contact Jim!
- Yeah!
Aggie dispersal calling aggie blue one, Gordon.
- Aggie dispersal calling aggie blue one, Gordon. Go ahead.
Aggie blue one, Gordon, back to Aggie dispersal. Go ahead.
Hello, Gordon. Wingman
Jason took off in p-40 ship.
He's unarmed and without radio communication.
Request you locate and signal him to return to base immediately. Go ahead.
Okay!
Get your checkbook out, general.
Woody! Woody! Woody!
Woody, are you all right?
Oh, I'm all right.
Well, I walked away from that one.
Hey, whose side are you on?
Report to my office immediately.
Okay, pappy.
A few more landings like that, and he'll be a japanese ace.
Where do you think you are, with some broken-down flying circus?
It would have been a cinch. I was riding the murder spot right above those japolas.
If I had ammunition, I'd have blown them clear out of China.
And you washed out a good ship.
You talk like that crate is more important than me.
I can't afford to lose either planes or pilots.
Pappy, it's like I told you down at the barracks:
All I get out of this is the dough, so you can't blame me for trying.
In a skeet match, the guy who knocks down the most pigeons wins the cup.
I can't have grandstanders trying to hog the whole show.
Results here are based on cooperation and understanding.
Discipline in the air is strict because that's the only way... an outfit like this can operate.
- Wait, Hap.
- All right, I'll admit I was wrong.
I made a mistake.
Okay.
In this kind of warfare, a fella likes to feel he's flying with somebody he can trust.
- What do I care? It's every man for himself, isn't it? - Not these days.
Wait till you look back and see a jap sitting on your tail...
In a ship that you can't outmaneuver.
- Then you'll know what I'm talking about.
- Okay, pappy.
From now on, I'll study my lessons and practice the piano every day.
There won't be any more trouble.
I'll be a modest, respectful soldier if it kills me, I swear.
Okay, Woody.
You got a cigarette?
- Keep them.
- Thanks.
You got a match?
Afraid you're gonna have a little trouble with that ball of fire, skipper.
Oh, Woody's all right.
Gets a little off beam once in a while,
But he's gonna develop into the best flier in this squadron.
That's what counts.
You see how he went after those three japs? That took nerve!
Yeah, he's got nerve, all right.
Got a cigarette?
These are the planes you'll be tangling with.
Know them so you can identify them.
Plenty of these planes carry detachable auxiliary gas tanks,
Which give them great range.
These tanks are dropped when they reach the objective,
So they don't lessen the plane's fighting efficiency.
The Kawanishi 96 can carry about a half a ton of bombs as well as scout.
But the most modern fighter, and the toughest one to crack, is the Nakajima.
It isn't fast, but it's light and maneuverable.
If you find yourself in trouble and have to bail out, there's one important thing to remember:
Do a closed-chute fall.
Drop as far as possible outside the combat area before pulling the cord.
That's to prevent our little brown friends from following you down...
And machine-gunning you while you're hanging helplessly in the air.
It's a quaint little habit of theirs.
And watch for the man who's hit the silk.
Protect him whenever possible.
You know what I'm not gonna do, pappy?
I'm not gonna ask you what to do if that chute doesn't open...
- Because you'll say-
- Take it back to the factory. oh, yeah.
No hits, no runs, no errors.
There must be something
I'm doing wrong.
Yesterday I unloaded a whole case of shells...
Before I seen I was firing at my own shadow on a cloud.
You keep shooting at those clouds, the angels are gonna get sore at you, boy.
Thirteen for our team and nobody benched. Nice work, boys.
- Thirteen?
- You ain't superstitious, are you?
If you are, the next time
I go up, I'll make it 14.
Yeah, I'll bet.
I could take that scoreboard down to the bank and cash it in right now.
Two thousand smackers, and today's only Thursday.
Any of you hangar pilots top that yet?
I knew a fellow who tied it once, only he didn't live to spend it.
It's too bad he waited. I have a feeling, that if
I hit my stride, you guys can take a vacation.
- At my expense, of course.
- How does it feel to be a one-man team?
- I don't get it.
- You're not the first ball carrier... that didn't appreciate his interference.
Give me that in straight English.
Twice I've been on the tail of a Nakajima... when you've cut in for the kill and the credit.
- Hold it, Blackie.
- Wait a minute.
Let him talk.
There's only one guy you think of up there
Woody Jason.
Listen, sorehead, every time I ever cut in on you I probably saved your life.
If I were you, I'd be the last guy to talk about cutting in.
I saw the tunnel that my pal Lefty
Matson dug in the Cleveland air races.
Probably figured his turn wrong.
Everybody saw what happened.
Oh, sure. It was all cleared up in the investigation.
But they forgot to smell your breath.
- Quit it! Save it!
- Attention, "a" flight,
Elements "a," "b" and "c".
Enemy aircraft in force over Mekong bridge. Tails up!
- Get moving, you two guys!
- I'm not through with you yet.
Okay, Tom.
You know where I live.
Hear about Jason?
He got another nippo today.
Yeah. It's too bad they don't pay off on dead pilots.
Hey, wait a minute, fellas.
You can't pin this mistake on me.
If Blackie hadn't opened his parachute so soon, it wouldn't have happened.
Maybe if you'd have followed Blackie down, it wouldn't have happened either.
- You were nearest to him. What happened?
- A Mitsi got in my way.
I guess it's easier to see 500 bucks than a pal of yours in trouble.
Hey, you got five planes now.
That makes you an ace.
"ace"?
How do you spell it?
Mike, that ship gassed?
- Yeah, him full to top.
- Okay.
Oh, Jim, do you mind if I use that ship?
- Where are you going?
- Up for some fresh air.
It's a little heavy in the barracks.
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.
Woody.
I got to know the truth about one thing:
Could you have prevented
Blackie Bales' death?
No, Jim. I saw him fall, but I didn't see him open his chute.
I was sure he'd wait until he was safe.
If I thought he was in danger,
I'd have looked after him.
That's good enough for me.
Thanks, pappy.
I never saw anything like the way he went after those ships.
It was something. First one and then another and then-
None of us want to go, mrs. Bales.
We'd all like to live to be 108.
But few of us get a chance to go out... in a blaze of glory like Blackie did.
H- he wasn't afraid.
Blackie wasn't afraid of anything.
You know, we got a pretty tough bunch of guys up there.
They've got to be for what they're up against.
But when it came to real fighting spirit, none could touch Blackie.
- D-did they like him?
- Oh, they were crazy about him.
He was great to be around;
Always making cracks and keeping people's spirits up.
I'm glad.
I suppose you'll be going back to the states.
This belonged to Blackie.
So much?
Oh, sure. He knocked a couple down the week before.
- He never wrote me.
- That shows you what kind of a guy he was.
He wouldn't even tell his wife how well he was doing.
Well...
I got to be going.
Good-bye...
And good luck to you.
Good afternoon, nurse. Good afternoon, madam Montier.
Are those our children laughing?
- Yes. It's that wonderful young man you sent to us. - I sent you?
You were a saint to think of it.
He's the first ray of sunlight these children have known in months.
I think I'll take a look at mr. Sunbeam.
Hurry, hurry, hurry. You're just about to witness that great, that colossal,
That stupendous mystery known as the disappearing half a dollar or-
Or now you see it and now you don't.
Now I need a young lady to assist me.
Will any young lady step up, please?
Some young lady, any young lady?
You, come on.
Come on. Aw, come on.
Come on.
Aw, come on.
That's the girl. thank you.
Oh, boy. This will amaze you before your very eyes!
In my hand here I have a brand-new half a dollar.
It's brand-new. I made it myself this morning. you can still smell the mint on it.
Uh, I will make it disappear into my elbow. Watch very closely.
Here it goes. Don't take your eyes off of my hand.
Well, now, watch me very closely.
Watch very closely what happens.
See? Oop, it slipped!
Watch it closely. You see?
Watch my hand. Everybody watch it very closely.
Here it goes.
One, two, three.
Hocus-pocus, bowlegged locust.
What happens? It's gone!
What do you know about that?
How do you like that, huh?
I wonder where it is now.
I wonder where it could be.
I think I know.
Yes, I do.
I see it.
Here it is, right behind your ear!
What do you know about that?
How do you like that?
Isn't that wonderful?
Yes, well, thank you very much, miss.
And now- excuse me.
Don't tell them, but that's the only trick I know.
You see, my public won't let me go.
If you persuade your public inside, I might be able to change some bandages.
Absolutely.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Right this way to see the beautiful nurse perform the greatest trick.
She is lovely, she is beautiful... And she's mad at me.
Hurry, hurry.
Come quickly.
Well, I guess they're going away.
I hope so.
Have the children get ready.
I'll change their bandages now.
Careful. She's slipping. They're pretty tough to hold when they're this young.
Some of them never get any older.
Where did you dig up all these kids?
Most of them were "dug up," as you put it, after the bombings.
Are they all orphans?
The little girl you're holding walked almost 1,000 miles across China to get here.
She lived on roots or whatever else she could find to eat.
How did she find this place?
I don't know. Some instinct brings them here.
Or, perhaps, one child tells another.
But always after a bombing, here they are:
Starved, patient, silent.
- I had no idea.
- Very few people do.
Well-
There you are, darling.
- What's she selling?
- She's brought you these rice cakes as a tribute.
Tribute? For what? That corny trick with the half a dollar?
No, for your courage and loyalty as a member of the Flying Tigers.
Oh.
What else did she say?
Um, we are humbly grateful and beg you to accept these useless rice cakes... even though they are not worthy of so honorable and so brave a warrior.
Yeah, well, tell her okay and thanks,
And I'll keep them flying.
Thank you.
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight, and we can have these for desert?
Sorry.
No?
I'm having dinner with Jim.
Hey, these are good!
You want I should come back again or you want to order now?
What's good tonight?
We have special american dishes:
Egg fu yung, candied duck or chop suey.
Have you any roast beef you can cut with a fork?
You surely have oysters you can cut with a knife?
- No floor show?
- No, sir. No floor show.
But music...
Very nice.
Can't you turn that record over? Has it only got one side?
Oh, him turn over, no music,
- But him turn over.
- Never mind.
- We're getting so we like it.
- Thank you.
Look, chin, why don't you surprise us?
Bring us something new like... Chow Mein.
Ah, very nice. Very good chow mein. American dishes.
Oh, I'm sorry, Brooke.
- Sorry? What are you talking about?
Well, you know, all this.
If we were back in the states, we'd be having dinner at some good restaurant,
Dancing once or twice, might even go out to a show.
What's the matter with this?
The food here is excellent.
As for the music, there's a wonderful orchestra on that record.
A little hoarse by now, but we can still dance.
Ask me and see.
Miss Elliott, may I have this dance?
I've promised it to that dashing lieutenant in the horse marines...
But I don't think he'll mind.
- What's wrong?
- This came for you.
It's in code, so I thought it might be important.
- I hate to break in on you two.
- That's all right, Hap.
- I'll have to get back to the field and decode this. - Of course.
Sorry, Brooke. I guess we can never really plan anything-
Ah, it's ready.
Nice dish, very nice.
- Sorry, Chin. We got to run along.
- What I do with this?
You eat it.
Me eat this?
No, sir. No, sir.
I dragged you all out of bed and every place else because this arrived.
I haven't had any mail for months.
I didn't know that any of your friends could write.
Well, here it is.
"Commencing the first-" that's tomorrow.
Your squadron assumes continuous night reconnaissance in alternating patrols".
Signed R.T. Lindsay and so forth.
In simple language, that means we start a night patrol as well as day.
But, Jim, we're not set up for night flying.
We have no beacon and no landing lights.
- We'll use the headlights on the trucks.
- How?
We have six vehicles. We'll line three up on each side of the runway.
That's all right for takeoffs, but what about landings?
Those lights can be seen from
5,000 feet up on a clear night.
Fine. Suppose there's a ground fog. What happens then?
Well, Woody, all you have to do is use your fog knife.
"fog knife"?
What's that?
- Don't tell me Jason hasn't got one of those.
- Every ace has one.
Sure. When you're caught in a heavy fog,
All you do is cut a hole in it with your fog knife...
And drop down like in an elevator.
You must have fallen through one of those holes on your head.
Easy, easy. Let's save that for the annual barbecue.
Now pay attention. No pilots must leave the post.
All leaves are automatically canceled.
Starting tomorrow morning at
Must report to dr. Singh for a physical checkup.
That's all.
Scatter and get some sleep.
- Woody.
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Sure.
- What are you gonna do, stand me in the corner? - No.
I'll be leading flight "a," and
Hap here will be leading flight "b".
I want you to take over
Hap's old position,
Number two in back of me and my flight.
Okay, pappy.
Don't worry about a thing. Good night.
Good night, skipper.
Good night, Hap.
Some of you guys don't seem to understand the reasons for these special tests.
Sure we do. It's to find out if we need a seeing eye dog. okay, okay.
It's funny now.
The first time you're on a night flight...
And a string of tracers come hissing out at you from the dark,
You'll be glad we rechecked your eyesight and reflexes. Sure. We know that.
Night patrol calls for peak efficiency and perfect physical fitness.
Right.
- Where did you dig that up?
- Well, I've been studying.
Don't, doc. That's cold, and I'm ticklish.
Nothing wrong with his reflexes.
Alignment blocks, please.
Is everything all right?
All these reports go to squadron leader Gordon.
The final decision rests with him.
I sure would hate to miss out on night patrol.
I hear those japos glow in the dark like bugs.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Having your oil changed?
Well, is my eyesight failing me or is it that beautiful hunk of man?
You keep that up and someday they'll put you on the radio.
Come on, fellas. Let's go to the gasoline dump and get a breath of fresh air.
- You asked for that. Jason
- Okay, okay! I'm not beefing, am I?
- Where's the gadget you wanted me to come back for, doctor? - Yes, over here, please.
When I examined mr. Jason this morning, this had not arrived yet.
I asked him to come back with the others.
- Is that what you wanted?
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you. - You know, Jason, people that fly upside down...
.get a pretty twisted picture of what's going on all around them.
Yeah, thanks, Hap.
Thanks a lot.
You well enough to travel, Alabama?
Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
All right, mr. Hap.
Think I'll fall apart, doc?
You should outlive
Confucius.
That's good enough for me.
You want to see me, skipper?
Sit down, hap.
I've made a change.
Tex Norton will lead flight "b" instead of you. That's okay, Jim.
I'd rather be up there in my old spot anyway, protecting your tail.
It isn't that, Hap.
I gotta hand you one on the chin.
But I'd rather it came from me than from somebody else.
Go ahead, Jim.
You're through flying.
The doc said I'd live to be a hundred.
If you stay on the ground.
Oh.
I see.
Okay.
- Was there anything else?
- No.
Wait a minute.
I can't send a man up that doesn't know whether he's flying upside-down or not.
Take a look at that physical.
Your depth perception's a mile off.
I know you've been gunning 'em since they were box kites with broomsticks for rudders,
But, you gotta believe me,
I'm doing this for you!
You've been close winging in formations, overshooting your landings-
You don't have to say any more!
I'm sorry.
I was kind of figuring on going back to the states anyway,
Maybe get me a chicken ranch or something.
- I hear there's a lot of dough in eggs.
- Eggs?
Who are you trying to kid?
You haven't been saving any money.
You've been giving it away as fast as you make it.
Look, Hap,
I need you here.
What could I do now?
Taking care of these crates on the ground is just as important...
As flying them upstairs.
I got to have a man
I can trust on the ground.
I wish you'd take that job,
Hap.
- You're not doing this to...
- No.
I really need you.
Well, ground kind of hurts my arches,
But, well,
I'll think about it.
Thanks, Hap.
Wait a minute.
I didn't swing at that one.
Come on.
Okay. I never could bat without my spike shoes anyway.
- Come on, come on.
- You're out.
Come on, let her go.
- Woody.
- Hello!
- How are things going?
- You better not be seen talking to me.
I'm poison ivy. Everything I touch breaks out into a rash.
I, um, I just got a letter from mrs. Bales.
- What's she writing you about?
- I sent her Blackie's things. She wrote to thank me.
- Oh. - She said to be sure and give you her regards.
- Well, um... - You are a difficult man to get to know, aren't you?
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight and get to know me better?
You don't take no for an answer, do you?
Why should I, when it's just as easy to say yes?
- Isn't it?
- Yes.
Well, swell! I'll meet you tonight at the orphanage at 8:00.
- Right?
- Okay. See you later.
Uh, wait a minute.
Don't say anything to anybody about mrs. Bales, will you?
I don't want to spoil my record. All right.
And be on time!
Hey, 'bama.
Those guys only got seven lucky hits off of me in three innings.
Yeah, swell. I'm going off the reservation tonight. I got a date.
What about night patrol?
You're on "a" flight.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll be back in time.
But if anyone asks any questions about me, you cover me.
I'm getting that old feeling.
All right, fellas, synchronize your watches at 10:55.
It's now 10:54 and 57...
58, 59, mark it.
- Tex, "b" flight must relieve us at exactly 11:55. - Right.
Otherwise, we might mistake you for the enemy. That's about it.
Take off in four minutes.
I thought Jason was here.
Well, I thought I saw him getting dressed just a few minutes ago, sir.
- Well, get him on the field.
- Yes, sir.
Warm 'em up.
- Did you see Woody? I just stalled the skipper. - No.
He'll wring my neck too if he finds out Woody left the field.
- Against orders?
- Yeah, but he said he'd be right back.
Well, he's Jim's number two man.
He'd better be back.
Tell pilot Jason takeoff is in two minutes.
Yes, sir.
- All right, warm it up, Mike.
- Okeydokey.
- Waiting for mr. Jason, please.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Tell him he'll be right there.
- Yes, sir.
- I still don't think this is right.
- You keep your mouth shut.
But if anybody's gonna take
Woody's flight, it ought to be me.
Are you crazy? I've been flying number two for Jim for over a year.
I know every one of his quirks, every one of his moves.
- We're a team. Don't you understand?
- Yeah, I know, but-
It's like he was the ball carrier and I was his interference.
Yeah, sure, but I still don't like it.
- You're to stay on the ground.
- Not so long as Jim is in the air.
Missed the 5:15 again.
- You're gonna have a hard time talking yourself out of this one. - Who, me and pappy? No.
- I wonder who's flying number two?
- Where have you been?
- I'm late. So what?
- So hap took your flight, that's what.
- All right, I'd do as much for him, wouldn't I?
- But Hap was grounded.
Yeah.
"a" leader to "a" two.
Go ahead.
What's the matter, Jason?
Have you gone to sleep?
"a" two to "a" leader.
What do you want? Go ahead.
Hap! Where's Jason? What are you doing here? Go on back!
Sorry, Jim. Remember me? I'm the little man who's always there.
Besides, it's too late.
"a" leader to flight "a". Nakajima fighters on port quarter. Combat formation.
Attaboy, skipper!
Give 'em the old one-two!
Don't worry, Jim.
I'm climbing his back porch now.
Pull out, Hap!
Pull out!
I hope you two had a good time...
'cause Hap paid the check.
Jim.
There's an army truck out of here day after tomorrow for Lai Chau. Be on it.
- Don't say that, Jim.
- Until then, you're confined to your quarters.
But I'm still a good flyer.
I'll knock down ten of those rats for every one of our boys.
It's out of my hands now. None of these men will ever fly with you again,
And they have to fly.
Yesterday...
December 7, 1941...
A date which will live... in infamy.
The United States of America...
Was suddenly and deliberately attacked...
By naval and air forces... of the empire of Japan.
The United States was at peace with that nation... and at the solicitation of Japan... was still in conversation... with its government and its emperor...
Looking towards the maintenance of peace in the pacific.
I believe that I incorporate the will of the congress... and of the people when I assert... that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost,
But will make it very certain...
That this form of treachery... shall never again endanger us.
Hostilities exist. there is no blinking at the fact... that our people, our territory... and our interests... are in grave danger.
With confidence in our armed forces,
With the unbounding determination... of our people, we will gain... the inevitable triumph...
So help us, god.
I ask that the congress declare...
That since the unprovoked... and dastardly attack by Japan... on Sunday,
December 7, 1941... a state of war has existed... between the United States... and the japanese empire.
- How are you, Jim?
- Good, colonel. And you?
I don't have to tell you what our entrance into the war means... to the volunteer group in China.
Our responsibility is grave. You and your men will have to take greater risks now.
I think they know it, sir.
This hits them where they live.
- I don't think any of them will let you down.
- I'm sure they won't.
Come here.
Intelligence reports that the japanese are starting a new drive from this point.
But to camouflage that move, they're starting a fake attack from this point.
Under cover of which, they intend to bring up supplies and munitions from here.
Now, we must destroy this bridge and delay the supply trains which pass over it.
- I see. - That's the only way we can give general Chiang Kai-Shek... sufficient time to establish his defenses.
I know that area. It's a nest of antiaircraft and Nakajima squadrons.
Thank you. They can send up an anac umbrella... high enough to make any attack ineffective.
I warned you what we'd be up against.
- But there's a way to do it, I think.
- Yeah?
A bomber squadron, even with our protection, wouldn't stand a chance.
- But a single ship might get through.
- How?
By flying through the canyons instead of over them.
Taking off at dawn and hugging the sides of the hills away from the sun,
A pilot might bring his ship through the pass and directly over the bridge.
- Sounds like hedgehopping to suicide.
- Maybe.
But if you think it can be done,
I'll order a bomber here right away.
- I think we can use that transport.
- What?
They've been flying over enemy territory for five years.
They get potted at, of course, but they don't attract as much attention as a military ship.
What about bombs? It's got no bomb rack, no bomb release, nothing.
We can figure that out.
There's eight or nine cans in our munition dump marked, "nitro U.S.A".
I think I can find a messenger boy to deliver them.
A job for a volunteer, of course.
Of course.
Doggone it. You ought to be tar and feathered, Woody.
Getting yourself slung out of this outfit just when things are getting exciting.
What's going on out there?
- Huh?
- You heard me. What's happening?
That's the skipper's idea.
He's gonna go fix breakfast for the jappies.
Gonna serve them soup.
- Who's going with him?
- Nobody.
If you ask me, it's a one-way trip.
These reports must go out daily to keep colonel Lindsay informed on our status.
Yes, sir. Ship Norton to ground operation,
Selby and Evans to night patrol, flight "a".
- Miller ought to be about ready now to start in again with Reardon as a team. - Right.
That's about all, except you'll have to keep after Kunming for gas, oil and supplies... and Toungoo for replacements.
- Take good care of the store, Mac.
- I will, sir.
I- good luck to you.
Thank you, mac.
Come in.
Yes?
I have dr. Singh's report on Barton.
How is he?
You can have him back in a week.
- Colonel Lindsay's waiting outside, Jim.
- Right.
Jim!
Good luck.
Thanks.
I haven't wanted to question you, Jim,
But I thought you were gonna call for volunteers.
It only takes one, doesn't it?
Thank you, colonel.
Mike, rev it down!
Mike, cut those motors!
What do you think you're doing?
Cut those motors!
Get into your parachute.
I'd land and throw you out if I could take a chance on that cargo back there.
Bail out at 1,500.
You can't handle this crate all by yourself. It's a job for the two of us.
Somebody's got to handle this stick while the other guy drops the stuff.
- You know that as well as I do.
- Not the way I got it rigged.
I know I've been a lot of trouble to you since we first got to be friends.
You're the only guy I know who stuck by me.
If you're trying to alibi the way you've been living, we'll run out of gas.
Maybe I did start out just to have a bunch of laughs-
Woody, anyone who looks ahead in this racket is crazy.
I don't blame you for grabbing what you can today.
You don't mean that. If you did, you'd have dropped me long ago.
Hit the silk.
Look, Jim...
I had to talk to you.
I don't know where
I'm going from here or...
When I'll see you again.
It's like
Brooke said:
I don't know anything about anything:
Why we're here, why we're fighting, all that sort of stuff.
She tried to straighten me out too.
Although half the time she was talking about you and roast beef...
And San Francisco and all those crazy things.
- See what I mean?
- Are we gonna say good-bye like this?
- Bail out!
Okay.
I got it coming to me.
But there's one thing you gotta get straight on.
A whole lot of us just don't grow up. We stay kids.
The most important thing to a kid is the street he lives on.
It's his life.
It's his whole world.
That was me when I first joined up with you.
Hong Kong, Shanghai,
Chungking-
They didn't mean anything to me.
Just a lot of names in a geography book,
Not towns where millions of people were being maimed and killed by bombs.
If you called them Texas,
Maine or Michigan...
That would have been different.
They were my street. That's why I acted the way I did.
Not because I was a heel, but because I was still a kid.
It cost another man's life to make a man out of me.
If you don't think that will stay on my mind as long as I live,
Then you don't know any more about me than... I think you did in the first place.
Well... That's all, and happy landing.
Sit down, Woody.
Check the course.
Okay, pappy.
Well, here we go into the tunnel of love.
Pull her up!
Did you know I used to drive a roller coaster?
- Delivering nitro?
- Yes.
- Were you killed?
- Uh-huh.
- Take over. I want to get into this chute.
- Right.
Looks like the supply trains are moving.
But the bridge ain't.
You may serve the soup course now, pappy.
Get her closer.
If I get any closer to that bridge we'll have to pay a toll charge.
- Let her go!
- Not yet!
Give the gentleman a cigar!
If they want to cross that river, they'll have to swim it.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
This crate's got enough lead in its belly to sink a battleship.
Don't look now, but our tail feathers are on fire.
- Huh?
- This is it, pappy. Let's take a powder.
Six cans of nitro aboard and that train's still running.
Yeah, but this is one train we're gonna have to miss. Come on, let's go.
- Right.
- Throw it on automatic.
Come on!
Hit the silk, Woody!
Here we go!
Happy landing, Jim.
Do me a favor, will you, pappy?
Give my leather jacket to
Reardon. He's a cold character.
Divide my address book evenly between the boys in the barracks. and give my silk scarf to the next head-chopper that thinks this is an easy racket.
Woody.
Come in.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, Barratt.
This is your first time up. Don't try to win this war all by yourself.
Stay close to formation. If you find yourself in trouble, pour on the coal and head home.
- Yes, sir.
- Just a minute.
This is for you.
- Gee, thanks.
- Take good care of it.
- It belonged to a pretty good flier.
- Sure.
Flight "a". flight "a".
Reconnaissance patrol, two minutes.
- How about having dinner with me? I hear
Chin has a new record. - Swell.
Tall and skinny, mean tempered and extra fast with gun
Travels with half-wit uncle called Uncle Roscoe something
# Round and round we're goin'
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
And bye-bye, Lucy Long
# Old Joe Clarke, he had a wife
# She was seven feet tall
# She slept with her head in the kitchen
And her big feet in the hall
# I wished I had a sweetheart
# I'd put her on the shelf
# And every time she'd grin at me
I'd get up there myself
# Round and round #
Melody, how many verses you say there was to that song?
About 100, I reckon
- But I only know about 90 of 'em
# Bye-bye, Lucy Long
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Round and round we're goin' #
Melody, what is it?
Some cow town, it looks like
How come here?
I thought there wasn't any till Hot Creek
- I don't know, unless
- Unless what?
George, you recollect that fork in the road
500 miles back, we turned right?
I just remembered we should have turned left
It don't surprise me none
A cowhand that goes in for breaking horses, he's been hit in the seat of the pants so many times, he ain't got any brains any more, just oatmeal in his head
# I wished I was a big, red apple
# Hanging on a tree
# And every pretty girl that come along
# Would take a bite out of me
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Round and round we're goin'
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Bye-bye, Lucy Long #
- Howdy, friend
- Howdy
- Where are we, old-timer?
- This here's Payneville
Painful? What's painful?
- This here is
- You mean generally or is this personal?
It's a bad sign when the first fella you meet in a town is some kind of hobgoblin
Don't go far I don't aim to be drinking for more than five or six hours
- Is that him?
- Yes, I think so
(softly) # Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Round and round we're goin'
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Bye-bye, Lucy Long #
I guess she's got as much right to get thirsty as a man
(hums)
- Look She's coming out
- Just look at that walk
Very nice
Very nice
- No, Ira Don't
- Let go of me
No, look!
I didn't mean nothin'
I didn't know
All right From now on, don't go making remarks about other men's girls
Yes, sir
No, no, sir No
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, señor
You want something maybe, please?
Give me some of them
¿Tomates?
- Open 'em I'll eat 'em here
- Sí, señor
Again
Don't try to draw with him
If you do, you're dead
- Did he see me?
- No
I thought he did
He'll cross back over to get his horse
We pushed a thousand head of cattle out there, me and my partner, him and me
What's more, you fuzzy-faced apes, my name ain't Roscoe and I ain't nobody's uncle
The next one that calls me so will get down on the floor
Don't look for me back, either
I will invest my money where at least one man ain't a lunatic
- Drunk already?
- Let's get outta this place
It's a spook town
The more I see, the more I don't like it
- They do something?
- No, outside of calling me their uncle
It's their attitude They're disrespectful
George, you take gettin' used to
You don't make the right impression
- You ought to know that by now
- Ought I?
You walk in someplace where nobody don't know you, you already got that dumb look
You ask some fool question any papoose could answer, like, "Where am I?"
You ain't immediately nominated for governor
You gotta walk in kinda unsmiling
Unsmiling?
Look and act like you're somebody, like you can take care of yourself no matter what happens
- Pretty soon you are somebody
- That what you done?
I ain't said more than two words in this town and already I got a certain standing
Unsmiling, eh?
I can walk in any place and clear my own place at the bar until they even before they know me
- All right Come with me
- Huh?
Come with me
Mr Unsmiling Jones
Thought you said you weren't coming back
(laughter)
(men fall silent)
- Your pleasure, gentlemen?
- Some liquor
Yes, sir
Stop goggling You're with me
- Mud in your eye
- Thank you, sir Thank you very much
- Good stuff
- Yeah
- I make it myself
- How much?
On the house, any time
Much obliged
You see?
It's spooked
The whole dad-blamed town is spooked
We gotta get outta this place quick
Why, it's all very simple, George
Simple? What would you have done if somebody had drawn on you?
What would anyone draw on me for?
Because you was asking for it The way you walked in, your face all scrounged up
It was just asking somebody to slap leather with you
Well
Look, Melody, you couldn't hit the hind end of your horse with a handful of bug shot
- Right in front
- He'll move
You ain't a gun fighter
You ain't even a good shot
You're just a no-good bronc stomper that's been hit in the seat of the pants eoeok
He's looking at something else
Darlin'!
Monte!
(whihspers) Don't move There's a gun on you
- Come with me Keep close
- Listen, lady
Do as I tell you and I'll get you out of this Smile Smile
That's better
Stay right here and I'll get your horses
- (George) Who is it?
- I never seen her before
In Cherryenne when you was kicked in the head and missing four days, you sure you didn't marry somebody?
I wasn't that far out of my head
Whoa
- Keep close to the front wheel
- But
- You looking to get shot?
- No
Then do what I say
When you start moving, move
Now can you tell us what happened?
- What's them initials stand for?
- That's for my name, Melody Jones
For Monte Jarrad too
You don't look much like him, really
Excepting you're built something like him
- Tall and spindly
- They took me for somebody else?
That's why I did what I did, so's you wouldn't get killed by mistake
Oh
- Then it wasn't me they were scared of?
- They thought you was Monte Jarrad
You say somebody is fixing to kill this here Monte Jarrad?
- Nobody but the sheriff and his posse
- Any particular reason outside of prejudice?
Well, there's always the reward, of course
1000 dollars, dead or alive
Mr Unsmiling Jones, a man with a certain standing in the community
(dog barking)
Whoa
- Is this Monte?
- No, they just took him for Monte
Of course it's Monte
Hi, Monte Heard a lot about you
Don't pay no attention to Pop
He's a little mixed up
This is Uncle Roscoe, ain't it?
Hi, Uncle Roscoe
I'd ask you to alight and eat, but I think you'd better keep going, south
I ain't in any hurry
Can't you understand?
There's gonna be a posse after you
Not after me I ain't done nothin'
- Ain't you gonna alight?
- No, he's gonna keep going
You can't be as thick-headed as that
This country's full of men just aiming to shoot you on sight
- Get outta here while you still can
- You heard what she said
- Get going
- Who are you?
He's my brother Avery
Now, are you going?
All right
Come on Uncle Roscoe
Cherry
Cherry
Let me in, Cherry
That's just the way it was
One punch and Ira Waggoner was flat in the road
Wish he'd broken his neck That's what I get for tyin' up with somebody I ain't never seen
- You don't even know Waggoner?
- I never saw him Leo picked him
It was fixed that the shotgun guy that got me was gonna be left behind
Outside the horse, there wasn't supposed to be no shootin'
- I got a good mind to blast his belly open
- That's right
- Get outta here!
- I was
Never mind Get to town and look for Leo, so I don't have to slope outta here by myself
Sure, Monte
You stay here
Now, what about this fella?
- He's nothing but a tramp cowhand
- Stop talking like a fool or like I'm a fool
How do you know he ain't one of Luke Packard's men?
Come on, Monte Sit down
There Now, he's nothing but a tramp cowhand who just wandered into Payneville with an old side rider
On account of the initials on his saddle, they took him for you
Cotton was fixing to shoot him when I got this idea
I figured the best thing I could do was help them keep on thinking he was you
Tomorrow, the posse'll be ridin' after him
50 miles from here, and the north'll be wide open for you
- See anything wrong about that?
- Yeah
Nobody's as stupid as you make him out to be
He's just a common, ordinary, useless bronc stomper, like you see any way you looked around here
He'd have done anything I asked him to
He would, huh?
He did, didn't he?
He kinda liked you?
Yeah, it looked like it
That's what I thought it was
You better be glad he did, too
There's something maybe you better remember
And never mind tellin' me how it didn't mean nothin' to you
Just don't monkey around with nobody at all, unless you wanna see their belly blasted open
In my life, I ain't never been so low in my mind as since I talked to that there girl
If we aim to get across that line, we ought to hustle up these ponies
- I don't aim to cross any line
- What are you talking about?
I don't aim to get across any line because that's what she wants us to do
I worked that out before her mouth shut
- You mean there ain't no posse?
- Sure, and it's probably trailin' us
There wouldn't be if she hadn't sicked it on us
Are you telling me that there pretty lady is a skunk?
Something happened back there we don't know what it is
If that posse's trailing us to the south, it'd make an opening for somebody to get away to the north
- I can't believe it
- Where is that somebody else now?
If what you say is a fact, he's hid out round that same place
- That's the way I figured it too
- Leastways, if she ain't, he
Wait a minute, Melody
You ain't gotta be no dumber than necessary
That would make me somebody
The man that took Monte Jarrad
- Now, you look here
- You don't understand, George
But for one hour back there
I felt what it felt like to be high-regarded
- I'm never gonna feel the same again
- But that fella's a killer
I might even get you can't tell get to be sheriff
(gunshot)
That or a corpse One or the other
Now, you just listen to me
- Where are you goin'?
- Back
But listen, Melody Melody!
You go on if you want to
If only you could shoot a little better
(howling)
What are we supposed to be doing?
Playing Indians?
You gonna ask her where he is?
I ain't figured out yet what I'm gonna do
I was mixed up in shootin' once I can't tell you how quick I got sick of the whole idea
Mm-hm!
- He's changed, Avery
- He can't help it He's in trouble
They're chasin' him and he's wounded
No, it's more than that
You know, when we were all kids together, just growin' up, he was kind of wild, of course
That's why I was so crazy about him, I guess
But it ain't wildness now He's mean
Plain, downright mean
And he's gettin' meaner all the time
There she is now Ask her
What you got in this mattress? Skulls?
Take your dirty feet off my bed
You've really got a crust
- My horse run off and I
- Shh!
Look, I don't know if you're crazy, but you've gotta get out of here
- I'll get you another horse and saddle
- I couldn't leave without Henry
- Your partner?
- No, Henry's my horse
I couldn't leave him, specially with his bridle on
- Where is your partner?
- George?
He's out somewhere in the brush
He's the nervous type
Oh
In some kind of a fix, ain't you?
Of course not All I'm trying to do is to keep you out of a fix
Don't you see?
That's why I took you out of town
You mean when you called me Monte in the middle of the street?
You've got it crazy about this Monte, ain't you?
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll make a deal with you
(dog barks and growls)
- What'd you do that for?
- Your dog's seen something
Somebody's prowling around out there
Your partner, maybe
No, he'd fall over something
Sounds like he's gone now
What kind of a deal?
Will you do somethin' for me?
Sure
- Stay in this room until morning?
- Do what?
Sleep here, in that bed?
For me? Will you?
- Why?
- I'll explain it in the morning
I just don't want you goin' outta here tonight
- All right
- You promise?
Sure
Thank you
- And for Pete's sake, stay put this time, will you?
- Mm
- Thanks Good night
- Uh
You don't wanna sit and talk a spell first?
Heaven forbid
- Stick 'em up
- You surely took long enough about it
- You heard me?
- I been listenin' to you for about five minutes
You always wanna shoot 'em in the right eye
Spoils their aim
I went back into town last night
To look into things
What'd you find out?
The way it looks now, as long as you keep on lettin' anybody think you're Monte Jarrad, you've got five chances of being hung or shot, which a fella tells me is a record in these parts
How come?
One the sheriff's got just about everybody in this county in a posse that ain't got no other aim in life but to catch you and hang you
Two there's a family in this county named Cotton that you killed three members of five years ago
This family, which has got about 150 uncles and cousins, is conducting an independent hunt to kill you ahead of the posse
Three?
Three if neither one of them crowds get you, the express company has got its men here because 40,000 dollars in cash was taken off that stage.
Some say 40 million, but that sounds like an overstatement to me
Four failing all them people gettin' you, you can look for the United States Cavalry to arrive
There was some mail on that stage
They aim to kill you both 'cause you is
Monte Jarrad and 'cause you ain't Monte Jarrad, and they just don't like to be disappointed
You said five
And five if you keep on looking at a certain female lady the way you've been,
I think we could count on Monte Jarrad himself to take a hand in the shooting soon
If this Monte Jarrad is such a well-known, popular sort of a jigger,
- how come I get mistook for him?
- Monte ain't been back for five years
Besides, you ain't run into nobody that knowed him good
You ain't fooled nobody that really knowed Monte
- I got a message for you
- I don't know nobody in Payneville
It was hardly a social introduction, but you did knock him over
Name's Ira Waggoner
He drove the stage that Monte held up
- How'd he know about me?
- He don't
"Give this to Monte," he said
Everybody thinks you're him
Everybody but this little lady skunk you're taking up with
(Cherry) Skunk, huh?
Mornin'
Cherry George didn't mean that
He was just shootin' off his face
- No, he's right
- Look, Cherry
Aw, what George thinks ain't what I think
You go on about your business any which way you wanna go
Now, look here There ain't any use to this
- You don't have to cry
- Please I am a skunk, and I know it
You ain't a skunk
You've been nice, even though you knew I was lyin'
I'm sorry I drug you into it Goodbye
Look, what kind of a box is it you're in?
Can't you tell me?
You see, I've known Monte Jarrad ever since we was kids
We grew up together
So when he rode in hurt, I tried to help him
- Did you get him out?
- No
They'll catch him now, I guess
The posse'll be pounding back by this evening
When I told you that I'd explain,
I decided to tell you the whole truth and see if you'd help me
Take a saddle, or anything to lead the posse away
There just wasn't nobody else I could turn to
You'd do anything for that belly gunner
This morning I decided not to
It wouldn't be fair dragging you in no further
I was gonna tell you the truth all right
I wasn't gonna ask you to do nothin' else
That why you brung
Monte's saddle along with you?
What?
Why, I didn't know it was there
I thought you might have noticed it when you put this blanket over it
I don't know why I even try to lie to you
Me neither
Come on, Henry
- What are you doing?
- Changing saddles
- You're gonna do it?
- It's what you wanted, ain't it?
Well, yes, but
Melody, you can make it, can't you?
I hope so.
They'll see you with the saddle and tell which way you went
You'll have such a lead, you'll make it
If you mean do I aim to get caught, the answer is no
A fella can stand just so much of that pounding, and then
I'm awful grateful to you
Is there something I can do for you, maybe?
Sure You can take care of my saddle
All right
Melody, ride as hard as you can and don't stop for nothin'
Goodbye
Well, that sinks the duck
Thank you
Thank you
- I meant goodbye
- Goodbye
Would you take something from me for keeps?
I won it for bronc stomping last year at Cherryenne
I was 17th.
Thanks, champ
Giddy-up!
Melody! Where you goin'?
Melody!
Whoa
He's gone with your saddle
You can see it a mile off
You said last night he'd left the house
Where'd he stay?
I don't know, Monte He just disappeared
- Start movin'
- Sure, Monte
You know what I'd do if you crossed me
I know you're in trouble, but I don't like that kind of talk
I didn't ask you what you liked
Just be careful what you're doin'
I'm gonna pick up Uncle Roscoe, and then I'm on my way
When you get through with what I told you to do,
I'll send for you Be ready
- Can I get by?
- Ten
- Up ten
- I call
You fellas oughta let people pass when they ask you
- Waggoner
- Back
You wanna see me?
Sit down
You needn't keep watching my gun
You couldn't stop it
There's only three men in these parts
I can't slap leather with One is Monte Jarrad
- But you ain't him
- No?
No You had me fooled for a time, but not after I thunk it over
But you're frontin' for him, and that's all I wanna know
Where is he?
- I was fixin' to ask you that
- I done my part of that job
Now I'm waitin' for you fellas to do yours
You understand?
Mister, I'm gonna tell you the truth
I ain't got the first idea what you're talkin' about
I want my share I wanna know where that money bag is You understand that?
No.
Then you'd better start remembering You're gonna tell me before you leave this room
You mean you figure
I know where that money is?
I figure you better
Well, I don't know exactly what to say to that
Nobody else has to know
Just you and me Fifty-fifty
(Melody hums)
Mister, I swear I don't know how you've lived as long has you have.
What do you mean?
- Do you remember Morgan Earp?
- Sure
He got his spine shot in two
He had his back to a door that had glass in it
Sure What about it?
If you look behind you, you'll find just that kind of a door
That's the oldest one in the book
That glass is painted over and I know it
Maybe, but I sure wish you'd give it a second thought
- I've had just about enough of this
- So have I
Hello, Leo
- Who's this?
- I don't know
- He's trying to pass himself off as Monte
- I know He's riding Monte's saddle
- What deal you making?
- I was trying to find out about things
- What things?
- I got a certain right to
To do what?
Sit here till I ride off
Then be someplace where I can find you
You understand?
Yeah
I wanna hear some more about them rights you're so worried about
Let's go
- Me?
- Come on
Walk ahead of me until we're out in the street
Mount your pony
Mister, I'm obliged to you for getting me out of that bar
Ride by my off-stirrup, close
- I ain't goin' that way
- You go the way I tell you to
I can't understand how in Sam Hill a tramp like you found a way to kill Monte Jarrad
Get going
Stay where you are
- Now, look, I'm sick and tired
- I'm gonna smoke a cigarette
When I'm done, I'm gonna throw it away
When I throw it away, take care of yourself
Some friend of this belly-bustin' gunman,
I take it
- Say it while you can, tramp
- Figure you're good with a gun yourself
Outside of Monte,
I've never seen anybody better
All I meet today is champions
You shot Monte in the back
You wanna try again?
I aim to pull out of this fix
It ain't my squabble and there's no sense in getting myself shot
- Monte Jarrad ain't dead
- Did he give you that saddle?
- No, he didn't, but his girl did
- What girl?
- Cherry de Longpre
- Did she kill him?
Ain't nobody killed him, you lunkhead
He got hurt bad and couldn't travel fast
I took his saddle as a favour to her, to fool jackasses like you away from him
A full growed man like you could let a girl talk him into a dang fool trick like that?
All I can say is here I am
I've heard some dumb stories in my time, but that one really takes the cake
Get ready
All right
This don't make no sense to me in any particular, but let her go
Put 'em up, black hat
Higher
Take his gun, Melody
Like I told your friend, never turn your back on anything, especially a woman
It's all right, George
- This the girl?
- Ain't she a lulu?
- Get off
- Just a minute, ma'am
If you're Cherry de Longpre, you'll know I'm Leo Gledhill
How do you do, Mr Gledhill? Now get off
- I'm a friend of Monte Jarrad
- The lady said get off, Mr Gledhill
You jughead We been looking all over for you
Take Mr Gledhill for a walk out in the desert
Way out, and leave him
- Get!
- Leave him and do what?
Follow Melody to where you was headed in the first place
You're gonna get out of this country
I'm gonna take you
- How do you like that for organisation?
- You know who I am
I don't know who you are, only who you say you are
But that's who I am
You could be Luke Packard who works for the express company
- Come on, Melody
- Yes, ma'am
Too bad, partner I know just how you feel
If there's anything in the world I like, it's gettin' saved from bein' shot
# I wished I had a candy box
# To put my sweetheart in
# I'd take her out and kiss her twice
And put her back again
- # Round and round #
- Melody
You know, Monte'd kill a girl if she done to him what I done to you
That's because Monte don't understand women very well
I suppose you do?
Pa gave me a piece of advice that ain't never failed me
"If you fool around a woman, hide a dollar in your boot, then you'll come out with a dollar"
"That is," Pa says, "if you keep your boots on"
- What are you gonna do now?
- Tie up with George
Head toward Hot Creek and work around there this winter
Will you be coming back this way in spring?
Maybe Don't like it much down there in the summer
If you do, will you do something for me?
I don't like to seem impolite, but after the way things been going,
I'd better listen to what it is first
I don't blame you
This money bag that Monte took, when you come back, I want you to give it back to the express company
- Can't
- You mean you won't?
- Don't know where it is
- I'm going to show you
It's in a little adobe house
Under the window sill, there's a slab
Under that there's a space for a man to hide in if he can breathe
It's in there Monte told me when it looked like he was gonna die
- Why don't we give it back to 'em now?
- We certainly will not
- Why not?
- Monte's gotta have his chance
They're looking for him
If that money popped up here, they'd close in so tight a jack rabbit couldn't get out
- We gotta wait till he gets away
- No, I'd better turn it in right now
You can't After promising me, you wouldn't dare
Promised? When was that I promised?
Well
Well, you gotta promise now
- Oh, well
- Well, do you promise?
All right, I promise
(howling)
(howling)
Melody
I'm awful sorry I hope you understand, and maybe someday you'll forgive me
Forget it
Ain't a thing in the world you've got to worry about, as far as I'm concerned
If you ever do come back through here
I tell you, Cherry,
I'd like to see you again a whole lot
But I just don't seem to be cut out for the kind of life you folks lead around these parts
Yeah, I see
- Good evening
- Luke Packard's the name
From the express company
Lift your hands just a little higher
And you, lady, step round the other side of him
I'd certainly be embarrassed if you grabbed his iron and flung a shot at me
That's something that's been worrying me most of my life
What would I do if a woman hung the drop on me?
Boy, oh, boy
Over
These don't give much light to speak of, but they'll warm it up while we wait
- Wait for what?
- The posse
- They're swinging around this way now
- Posse?
The sheriff and some of the boys are heading up here
Go over in that corner
What they're aiming to do when they get here,
I couldn't say They didn't tell me
- But you can't do that
- No? Why can't I?
They'll kill him, not arrest him
Those Cotton boys won't let 'em
They're legal, lady Legal to the teeth
I ain't the one they're after
I ain't Monte Jarrad
I'm Melody Jones I ain't never set eyes on him
I ain't never seen the gentleman in question myself
But this is Monte Jarrad's hideout
On information received, this here girl is Monte Jarrad's lady friend
Monte Jarrad is well known to be a beanpole, such as you be
When a posse makes a mistake, it's mighty hard to unmake
Come, now Let's don't look on the dark side
What other side is there, mister?
If them Cottons get hold of me, I'm a dead duck
It ain't gonna be no good to say sorry
The fact is, I don't care a hoot whether you're Monte Jarrad or Melody Jones or Harmony Q Smith
All I'm interested in is 42,004 dollars and 85 cents belonging to the express company I work for and not another cussed thing on earth
Once I get my hands on that, you're as free as a bird
- Can I talk to this girl alone?
- Step in there if you want
- You trust me?
- 100 per cent
You'll never regret it, Mr Packard
You'd better take a light with you
Well, how do you like that?
He's no better than a cheat
I couldn't break my word in here if I wanted to
What did you wanna talk to me about?
Oh, yeah Say, what about this?
- What about what?
- About my gettin' hung over this money
- How far are you aimin' to carry this?
- You know the situation
You figure if I tell where the money is, it'll hurt that belly buster's chances of gettin' away
But what about my neck?
You have to do what you think is right, of course
You gonna hang onto that promise you trapped me into?
- I'm not gonna argue about it
- Maybe you're in love with him, but I ain't
This thing's gone just about far enough, and ten feet further
Just as you please
- Made up your mind?
- Uh-huh
Well, where is it?
- Where's what?
- The money Stop stalling
What money was it?
You realise what you're doin'? That posse ain't more than 30 minutes from here, Monte
- I ain't Monte
- I ain't got any way to force you
But I hate to see a man taken apart without a chance to defend himself
- I'll tell you where it is
- What?
The money you're after Can't you keep your mind on what we're talking about?
- If I tell you where it is, can we go?
- That was the proposition
- Which man do you aim to be the death of?
- Shut up
It's under that slab under the window
Well, what do you know about that?
Mister, you're a
(gunshot)
Then you were telling the truth
Yeah
Look out for the fella doin' the shootin'
It's the real Monte He's after the money again
Is he dead?
Yeah
Shh
There's somebody out there
- Is that the way you always draw?
- You numbskull
I'm sorry, but I couldn't be sure who was in here
- Who is it?
- Packard, the express-company fella
Well, that sinks the duck
Now they got a "corpus delict"
- A what?
- A dead body
That's the way the law says it
If they've got a corpus, you're delict
Before this, we could have proved there was a mistake
- Then why did you do it?
- We could have
- Do what?
- Shoot him
- Him?
- Why did you shoot him?
Why should I shoot the man, a perfect stranger? Why should I?
Wait a minute
Both of you, you can't hang it on me
You was under the table with your gun smokin'
How do you account for that hole?
He ran outside, shot him, then came back in?
That's right
If it wasn't you, we've got that belly buster back with us
Melody, we gotta get outta this country and quick
- Ain't nothin' holdin' me back
- All right
But first you get the pony
Keep your eyes open
Maybe somebody's still out there
Don't you think we oughta keep clotted together?
Stop trying to think Do as I say
All right
We got housekeeping to do before we leave
Give me a hand
Let's get this corpus into that box
Here, help cover up these spots
- You with us?
- You bet
Come on
Step back
You're under arrest
Light those candles, Kriendler
Let's see what's going on in here
Stick 'em up, fella
- I can't say I expected much more of you
- This him?
- Ain't it?
- Do I have to go through all that again?
Sheriff, he isn't Monte
He's just some guy that's got all mixed up
- Hold me Put me in jail
- You think I'm crazy?
They're prominent in this county, the Cottons
If I was to let him go, they're as liable to string me up
Take it easy They'll be along any minute
If he ain't who they want, they won't touch him
Look, Sheriff, if they hang me, how are you gonna find out where the money is?
(coughs)
You know where the money is, even if you ain't Monte?
- I do
- (coughs)
- What ails you?
- Nothing
Just clearing my throat
Well?
- If I tell you, can I get outta here?
- If I was you
If he opens his mouth one more time, knock him in the head
I give you my word The minute that money's in my hand, that door's open
- It's right
- (Geoge) Oh!
No!
(sheriff) That'll teach you to keep your mouth shut
Come on
Come on?
Try any monkey business and I'll blow you clear outta this house
Where's that money? You said you knew where it is Let's have it, quick
- I'm afraid I changed my mind
- I'm giving you one more chance
Tell us, or do we have to get it outta you?
I don't think I got any suggestions
Get ahold of him Pin him
Anybody touches me is gonna get their brains knocked out
(shouting and gunshots)
(shouting)
You brush ape How did you think you were gonna stop a man?
What are you doin' here?
Just lightin' a candle
Melody, why didn't you go?
I reached for you, but I couldn't find you
I couldn't leave you in all this mess
Maybe I can be as tough as this Monte Jarrad
Maybe a little bit tougher
- Let's get outta here
- They stampeded our horses
Well, what do you know?
For the last time, where's that money?
I forget
All right, put your guns away and go to work on him
Don't knock his head clear off him because he's gotta talk, and quick
You
You get over there
Get him
Whop him, Melody Whop him!
Get your hands off me
I got him
Wait a minute Bring him out here
Where is it?
Let him have it
Hold it We gotta try somethin' else
- Why?
- You'll knock him out, then what good is he?
- Want me to heat up his spurs?
- No, the way he said it, it's in this room
The way he said it, it must be
It's got to be
There's a stiff in here
Holy jumping Jupiter!
- It's Luke Packard
- Luke Packard?
It is Luke all right
Run for it
Hey!
Open this door!
Come on back!
Come back here and open this door!
Come back here!
Cherry? Cherry?
Cherry? Cherry?
Cherry? Cherry?
Monte's headed for the de Longpre range
Come on, let's go!
Cherry?
Cherry?
Cherry?
Hi
You can stop thinkin' what you're thinkin' because you won't have time to throw that can
And you're too far for that Winchester
I thought you might be that Monte Jarrad, but that can't be
- No?
- No
That weasel looks somethin' like I do
Fools people sometimes
Get over there
Take off that holster
And the boots
Don't think we look alike, hm?
I don't think I deserve people to say anything like that about me
The jumper
It ain't gonna do you no good, you know
You don't think so?
Not even if we swapped every stitch.
'Cause there still wouldn't be no scar on my face
But who'd know that if there wasn't no face left?
- Is that what you really aim to do?
- The pants
I didn't come lookin' for you just to admire you, if that's what you mean
In that case, I guess I'd better fix you too
You ain't doin' this just because it suits you to
You got something else on your mind
Yeah?
Yeah But I ain't gonna help you with it none
I'm gonna make you ask about it
All right What about it?
- What about what?
- What about Cherry?
What about her?
You'll have to be clearer than that
- You know what I'm asking you
- Sure
But you're gonna have to ask it in plain words
- What were you doin' here the other night?
- If I don't tell you, you'll never know
- You'll tell me all right
- Will I?
Don't get smart I don't like it
And you won't like it either
What could you do that you weren't gonna do already?
That's what I meant when I say
I'm gonna fix you too
I ain't gonna answer that question
I'm gonna leave you to worry about that
But she ain't yours no more
- You're lying
- You see?
That's what you're going to have to worry about
Was I lying or not?
With me gone, you'll never know
From now on, you'll have to go on wondering about that, for as long as you live, which I don't figure to be very long
Come on
The hat
(Melody hums)
Know what you are now?
YOu're just an old used-to-be.
If you don't think so, ask her yourself
She's comin' in right now
You better get out to the barn
George is there He's hurt
Bad?
I think he's dyin'
All right, go on
Why did you shoot that old man?
He come asking for it Anytime somebody comes asking for it, they're gonna get it
Found him in the gulch where you left him
Where you left him to die
You're wearin' his stuff
So the tramp was tellin' the truth
Monte, you were gonna kill him too and leave him here to be buried as yourself
Get your dumb thumb out of my eye
- I was just trying to see if you were dead
- Well, I ain't
And I don't like somebody trying to gouge my eye out
- Monte?
- Yeah I stumbled onto him up in the rocks
You can't, Monte
Look out, Melody! He's coming!
Take care of yourself, tramp
Take my gun, Melody Take it and drill him
Partner, you ain't got no gun
Get outta here They're comin'
Inside
- You two cover that door
- Yeah
Leo, the front door
- Come back here
- Stop me
(gunfire)
- Look, Melody
- Sit down
Surrender in the name of the law!
- Take that horse and cut for it
- Why don't Monte go?
He can't race a horse with that wound, but you can
She's right You can't do no more damage around here
- No, I ain't goin'
- Why not?
Horse like that can't carry three people
Looks like we're gonna have company
- Did you get him?
- What for?
I ain't got anything against them fellas out there
- Get down You'll get your head shot off
- Why did you shoot?
He was shootin' too straight
George
Listen, George, only one thing about this business still puzzles me
- What's that?
- What I'm doin' in it
You was gonna make somethin' out of yourself
- Don't you remember?
- That's right
You was gonna take Monte and be somebody
- That sounds kinda silly now, I reckon
- (gunfire continues)
All I'm askin' you now is, tell me when you figure you is somebody so we can get the heck out of this shootin' gallery
Is that really why you stayed?
Well, not exactly
The truth is, I hadn't hardly got into that idea good before I kinda got sick of it
Too jumpy to suit my taste
Why did you ride back into Payneville?
You was all tangled up in something
I couldn't rightly figure out what
No use tryin' to talk sense into your head
The only way to get you out was for me to try to get inside and bust open the whole shebang
It never occurred to me that maybe you had reasons not to want to get out
Melody
What is it, Uncle Roscoe?
Where's my gun?
You ain't got no gun, George
You'd better give me one, Melody
If them fellas break in you're gonna need some help
Here you are, George
Got it?
Yeah
Don't make out you're worse off than you are, George
Here Drink some of this
(gunfire continues)
(hums vey softly)
We can't stand for this from nobody, George
- Hey, now
- That all you got? Four?
- What are you doin'?
- Nothin' you can stop, son
- Stop him, Avery!
- Come back here, you
I'm sorry
Hey, Monte Jarrad!
What about it?
What about it, Monte?
How about it, Monte?
M e eoedyyy, po eassse
I'm waitin'
Hey, men! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire! Let 'em shoot it out!
This one's for that scar on your face
You're walkin' too good
That one was a little too close
No face left, remember?
Thanks, partner
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy
# I ain't got no sweetheart
# I'm a long way from home #
Come on You can bring your hat this time
# I ain't got no sweetheart
# I ain't got no sweetheart
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy #
What a dumb town!
They catch you and then they don't hang you
They slung me in and they slung me out
- You still tryin' to make out you're bad off?
- Have you ever?
- What's this?
- Reward for drilling Monte
They held back 25 dollars for the doctor, five dollars on a charge of vagrancy, three weeks' rent for living in the jail when I wasn't guilty
- Why are you givin' it to me?
- You brung him down
Me? I couldn't have brung down a two-week-old baby
I was so dreamy, I couldn't hardly move, let alone use a drilling iron
But you had to, George It wasn't me
That shot came straight from this barn
- Avery?
- Flat out
- Pop, maybe?
- No, I had his gun
This is awful, George Awful
Who do you care saved your life?
I'd let anybody save mine
- I'm givin' up
- Givin' up what?
Everything I ain't gonna make no further fool of myself about her
- What in the Sam Hill are you talking about?
- She knowed him long before me
It was him or me, one or the other
She had a right to shoot at whoever she wanted to
Melody, if you mean what I think you mean, get outta my sight
- You ain't worthy for me to know
- I've been kiddin' myself too long
I know who she was aimin' at
Come in
Hello
- I was looking for my saddle
- Behind the curtain
What's that?
The reward
Oh
- I hoped you wouldn't take it like that
- I ain't blamin' you
It ain't no disgrace to be saved by a woman
What kind of a chump do you take me for?
You think I don't know who you were shootin' at?
- What?
- Look, Cherry
When a fella puts himself between a fella and his girl, he's got to look out on both sides
- He's got to be ready
- You mean I was shootin' at you?
I ain't blamin' you You had to make a quick pick which fella you wanted
I'm mighty glad you ain't any better shot than you are
Thanks for takin' care of my saddle for me
Why, you you butter-fingered gun juggler
Melody
Cherry!
Hold it
When I aim at somethin', I hit it
And when I hit somethin', that's what I aimed at
Don't tell me she missed you all three times
- I've changed my mind, George
- What now?
I decided I don't wanna be sheriff
Well, that's a right smart decision
I'm thinking it's about time
I was thinking about settling down
A fella that knew about ranching could make this dump into a nice place
- If he had a good foreman
- You ask her?
- Ask her what?
- For the job, you numpus
- You don't think I ought to go to Pop?
- Go away You disgust me
Well, if you think that's the way
(Melody hums)
(Cherry) Melody, stop it
Stop it, I tell you Stop
My goodness
You don't have to be so rough about it
Shh, he's here.
You gentlemen look like educated men of good taste.
I have here some rare old first editions.
He's not bothering us.
I'm interested in his books.
Okay.
Now here are the complete works of William Shakespeare, an old German writer.
I like that.
We move tonight.
Orders from Berlin.
Dr. Tobel is to be across the border before dawn.
But we'd had orders not to break into his house and he hides there.
Hasn't been outside in weeks.
The Fuhrer wants no trouble with Switzerland at this moment.
We must be very careful.
If we can't break in, he won't come out?
When the Fuhrer needs something as badly as he needs the
Tobel bomb sight there is always a way.
Dr. Tobel is interested in my scientific volumes.
He's see my forged papers and he believes I come from Yudthem.
No gentlemen.
The price is much too low.
I could not possibly sell such a rare book for such a price.
I will induced Dr. Tobel to come and visit to my shop.
It's the fastest way.
You're interested in this book, a rare old set of
Bismarck papers.
One last warning.
I've just had word from Berlin.
The English spy hunter will try to take Dr. Tobel from under our very eyes.
They are sending a stupid bumbling amateur detective.
His name is
Holmes, or Homes or some such foolishness.
He'll never escape from Switzerland alive.
Now quick.
Get me thrown out of here and watch for my signal from Dr. Tobel's window.
But gentlemen you promised to buy one of books.
I told you no.
Ah, stop bothering us.
They are not so great prices.
[Arguing in French]
French, English, how
I hate those languages.
Calm yourself my dear brother.
In a short time there will be only one language.
Good evening, Dr. Tobel.
I have here some very interesting scientific books.
I thought you might like to see them.
Please come in.
He's entering the house.
Quickly, get the car and have the motor running.
I will follow.
We'll have the Tobel bomb sight to the Fuhrer while this Holmes is still having his tea.
What are you doing?
I am sorry but for months every move I have made has been watched.
I am not a coward,
Mr. Holmes.
They won't watch you anymore.
Tonight they intend to take you forcibly across the German border.
Then why do we wait here doing nothing like rats in a trap.
Calm yourself my dear Dr. Tobel.
We should not only escape their trap but we should also take the cheese away with us.
But, but how?
The four sections of your bomb sight fit inside these ponderous tombs, although I must confess that I shy to the thought of disembowelling a complete set of
Charles Dickens.
Ah, but you cannot hide me in a hollow book.
My dear fellow.
I'm sorry that my good friend
Dr. Watson isn't here to explain to you that are my preparations are never slipshot.
Stephan, Eric.
Why do you call my servants?
Your servants, yes, but tonight they assume new roles.
Let me present Dr. Tobel and our old friend, the bookseller.
Holmes, it is so simple.
Yes, the obvious always appears simple.
Quick now.
We must leave.
Stephan, the knapsack.
Stephan, and Eric are proving excellent decoys.
And the Gestapo has been fooled?
Completely.
The servants are leading them into the next street.
But what will happen to Stephan and Eric?
Nothing, don't worry.
I've taken care of that.
Away from here.
Come on quick.
Do you want to take the Nazis own car?
One must adept oneself to the tools at hand.
You think you've made them believe you're a harmless old bookseller.
Yes, I've always felt that a thorough knowledge of the classics might come in handy.
But how can we get across the border and through France?
There's no need to get across.
This very moment a
Royal Air Force plane is waiting for us at the secret landing place.
How long before we arrive in London?
In a very few minutes.
We're passing over Dover now.
Thank you.
You'll have to get used to our London blackouts Dr. Tobel.
Ah.
Huh?
Dr. Watson is a very untidy fellow.
And what, what are we going to do with, with these?
A problem of the most elementary nature, my dear Dr. Tobel.
You arent going to keep them here.
And I have always believed in the theory originally projected by Edgar Allen Poe, the American writer, that the best place to hide anything is where everyone can see it.
Yes, but...
You will remember no doubt in Poes story "The
Purloined Letter".
And the missing in question was always in plain view.
Hands up, gentlemen.
Scotland Yard, quick.
Oh, my goodness.
Good evening, Mrs. Hudson.
Oh, why it's Mr. Holmes.
Holmes!
Hello Watson old fellow, it's good to see you again.
Telephone.
Huh?
Who do you want?
Oh yes, you're
Scotland Yard.
I'm afraid there's been a little mistake.
No need to get angry.
We all make mistakes at times.
What?
Well if we didn't you'd be out of a job.
Dr. Tobel, this is my friend and associate and as you may observed my watchdog, Dr. Watson.
How do you do, sir?
How do you do?
Dr. Tobel and I flew in from Zurich this evening.
You can put that thing away now, Watson.
Dr. Tobel awarded the maximum request for physics in 1939.
My dear Watson, there is only one Dr. Tobel.
Without Mr. Holmes there would have been no
Dr. Tobel I am afraid.
But I thought you were living in America sir.
I have been working in Switzerland for the past two years.
And Holmes got you out?
In the nick of time.
There was not a point he overlooked.
Every contingency was foreseen and provided for.
It was magnificent.
Thank you, doctor.
The problem was not without its interesting points.
Is there anything you would like, Mr. Holmes?
No thank you, Mrs. Hudson.
You can go to bed now.
He gave me an awful fright dressed up like that.
Well good night, sir.
She's quite right.
You can't blame me for jumping to the conclusions I did.
You looked like a broken down musician.
Holmes, why didn't you take your fiddle with you?
I never did think much of this dressing up business.
It was necessary,
I assure you.
The Gestapo was close on our heels.
Really?
This is Sherlock Holmes.
I want to speak to Sir
Reginald Bailey please.
Reginald Bailey?
Is that the fellow who played rugby for Black Heath?
Yes, Watson.
Oh.
Hello, Sir Reginald?
Holmes speaking.
Yes, from Bakers Street.
I have Dr. Tobel with me.
Well thank you.
Very well then, I'll meet you in half an hour.
And there must be no delay.
I'll arrange with Sir Reginald to have the test tomorrow morning.
I suggest that only cabinet ministers and your best aviation experts be present.
Naturally.
Watson, I leave
Dr. Tobel in your care.
Give him a sedative.
This has been strenuous business and he has a long day ahead of him again tomorrow.
Certainly Holmes, of course.
He shall sleep in my bedroom.
I'll keep watch till you return.
Thank you.
It is not necessary to guard me.
I am quite safe now.
Safe Dr. Tobel?
I shouldn't count on it for a second.
But Mr. Holmes...
A great deal may depend on your safety and the enemy understands that just as well as we do.
Good night.
Keep alert, Watson.
Yes, sir, of course.
A couple of these and you'll sleep peacefully through a blitz.
Thank you.
You better start undressing at once or you'll find yourself fast asleep in the middle of taking off your trousers.
Well I'll sit over here and keep an eye on things.
Oh by the way, if you're nervous call out.
Good night, doctor.
Good night, doctor.
Well funny I was saying the same thing at the same time.
Good night, doctor.
Good night, doctor.
Untidy fellow, Holmes.
Hello?
Yes, I just arrived about an hour ago.
It is most important that I see you at once.
No, no.
I cannot explain.
It is now five minutes past midnight.
I leave at once.
Goodbye.
Holmes, I don't have to tell you how much this means to us.
We'll know a great deal more about the bomb sight after the demonstration,
Sir Reginald.
You always have a pretty good idea of the value of the Tobel bomb sight, just as the Nazis have.
However.
Oh, if you care to place
Dr. Tobel under the protection of Scotland
Yard until tomorrow.
No, no, no.
No, that won't be necessary.
I shall personally deliver Dr. Tobel to your representatives on Salisbury Plain in plenty of time for the demonstration.
Thank you.
Good night, Sir Reginald.
Good night, Mr. Holmes.
Charlotte Eberli, Flat B.
Right.
Get the car, ready.
I'll wait here until he comes out.
Is that what the
Americans call doodling?
It is more serious than you could possibly realize, Charlotte.
Good.
More coffee?
No, thank you, darling.
I must get back before they miss me.
We've been separated for so long.
I couldn't bear that anything should part us again.
I want to work with you and I want to know every minute where you are.
Even for you to know the details of my mission in London is to sign your death warrant.
If you are in real danger
I want to share it.
There is one thing you can do.
Guard this envelope.
If anything happens to me see that it reaches the hands of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Yes.
I pray I never have to deliver it.
Help!
He got away.
Are you all right, sir?
I, I think so.
It must have been a robber.
Yeah, since the blackouts those have become quite a nuisance, sir.
Uhhh.
I say you better come with me and have that fixed up.
Uhh, thank you.
Just lean on my arm.
Watson.
Watson, wake up.
Huh?
Where's Tobel.
He, he, he's there.
No he isn't.
He's gone.
That's impossible.
He's asleep in my bed.
I've been here the whole time.
If anything's happened to him.
Tobel, you all right?
Ahh, it is nothing.
Yes.
Sit down here.
Let's have a look.
Well it doesn't look too bad.
Who patched you up, the police doctor?
Yes.
It looks as if you've been attacked.
Obviously, my dear Watson.
Dr. Tobel, do you suspect the woman of arranging the trap?
Woman, What woman?
She's blonde.
Five foot six, full lipped and very affectionate.
Oh really?
You've known her for a long time.
You were attacked after leaving her apartment.
Holmes, how do you know this?
The face powder around your coat tells me of her height and her affection for you.
You held her close before departing.
Huh.
It's all there for the trained eye to read, Watson?
But look here.
Why couldn't he have been attacked on his way to the woman's apartment?
The mark of the blow has erased some of the powder.
Obviously if the attack came first the powder would have remained undisturbed.
And the full lips that was a guess.
I never guess, Watson.
You have rubbed the lipstick from your face with a handkerchief you now hold in your hand and that amount of lipstick never came from a pair of thin lips.
And the blonde hair?
Good gracious me.
Mr. Holmes, I am glad you are on my side.
Well in that case you will desist from disobeying my orders and slipping out while your bodyguard sleeps his watch away.
It won't happen again, Holmes.
I was sitting in front of the fire and must have dozed.
All right, All right.
Oh, sorry.
Now, can you describe your assailant?
I never saw him.
A great figure came at me in the dark.
I felt a stunning blow on my head and, and instantly fingers were at my throat.
But you must have noticed something about him.
Think man.
A thing of little consequence to you may mean a great deal to me.
Wait.
Wait a moment.
There was one thing.
Long fingers at my throat like, like steel.
And then, then a, an odor, a heavy drug-like odor.
A drug?
Opium?
That is it.
I am sure of it now.
Well, I suggest we get the remains of a good night sleep.
Remember, the test takes place tomorrow morning on Salisbury Plain.
The principal of
Dr. Tobel's device involves the use of three sonic beams.
Is that right, sir?
That appears to be it.
There he is.
We're on the course now, sir.
Well gentlemen, that load would sink any ship in the world.
We must consider the possibility of good piloting and a lucky hit.
I'd like to see another try of it.
So would I.
They want you to try again, sir.
He's coming into position now, sir.
We're on the course now, sir.
Well gentlemen, how do you like the bomb sight now?
It's marvelous.
We'll revolutionize the aerial bombardment.
Inspector Lestrade.
Yes, Sir Reginald?
I hope Scotland Yard is taking every precaution to guard Dr. Tobel and his equipment.
Two plain-clothes men ride with him in his car sir, and four others follow in another one, sir.
Good.
He's coming to my office in Whitehall as soon as he lands.
Well shall we start, gentlemen?
Well, here he is gentlemen.
Congratulations sir.
It was excellent amazing performance.
It was magnificent,
Dr. Tobel.
Magnificent.
I am glad we had such ideal conditions for the test.
I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself.
We've been through a lot, Holmes but thank goodness he's safe now.
You brought your apparatus with you?
No, Sir Reginald.
I did not.
But why not?
It must be lodged in the most impregnable vault in this building until we're ready to start manufacture.
I have arranged for a little office of my own.
I intend to supervise the manufacture myself.
But you, you offered it to our government for our use.
Everything
Mr. Holmes has done has been with that ideal in view.
I still offer it to your government but no one else will know the secrets involved.
I have devised the plan to guard my invention, a plan as intricate as the bomb sight itself.
If you imagined for one moment...
Please.
I will not change my mind, Sir Reginald.
I am taking the matter into my own hands.
Just what do you propose to do, Dr. Tobel.
I am sorry.
I cannot reveal the details of my plan for the present.
Do you think that's wise?
I regret gentlemen.
I cannot change my decision.
I shall work independently.
Can't you persuade him, Holmes?
But supposing something should happen to you, Dr. Tobel.
You know, there's already been one attempt on your life.
And if Holmes' suspicions are right?
Quiet, Watson.
There is no use discussing it, gentlemen.
My mind is made up.
Scotland Yard will redouble the guard about you doctor.
In fact we'll quadruple it.
That is just what I do not wish done, inspector.
That would only draw attention to my activities.
Good day gentlemen.
Just the same I'll have my men watching him every moment from now on.
No, no, Wait Lestrade.
We must not offend Dr. Tobel.
We must remember that he, as a citizen of Switzerland, is under no obligation to give us his invention.
We must do as he asks.
Now don't you agree, Holmes?
But sure, Sir Reginald.
I'm not officially connected with the government and I intend to remain on the case.
Good, good.
That is if Inspector
Lestrade doesn't mind.
Not at all, Mr. Holmes.
We're always glad to have you hanging around.
Thank you.
You can put those away now, Lestrade.
Hoffner, I am entrusting this to you because first of all you are a Swiss and second there is no doubt in my mind of your ability.
I am honored Dr. Tobel.
I have divided the mechanism of my invention into four units.
Each is meaningless without the others.
You have delivered the other three.
Yes.
No one but myself knows the identity of the four scientists working on the four units.
Their names are not even known to each other.
I think I understand.
From what you tell me it will be easy to reproduce the unit assigned to me at any quantity you wish.
I knew I could rely on you.
I will get in touch with you as soon as I have made the rest of my arrangements.
No, no, no.
The back door if you please, Professor Hoffner.
Au vaus.
Au vaus.
Hello.
Yes, Lestrade.
Oh.
Very well.
What is it, Holmes?
Just as I feared.
Lestrade's men report that Tobel is missing.
Missing?
Yes, I was afraid of this.
How long has he been missing?
Practically since he walked out of your office yesterday.
If he'd only given the address of this place
I shouldn't have had to waste so much time finding it.
Empty.
The bomb sight's gone.
I didn't expect to find here, Sir Reginald.
This is a pretty mess.
If you knew this was going to happen why the devil didn't you do something about it?
You can rely on Holmes implicitly, Sir Reginald.
Tobel is gone and heaven alone knows where.
It serves me right for listening to that half-brained idea of his,
Dismissing Lestrade's men and they went leaving him here alone and unguarded.
Holmes, if anything has happened to Tobel, if his invention falls into the hands of Germany, it will be a major disaster for England.
Christmas wrapping.
He did his
Christmas shopping in plenty of time.
Yes, curious.
Do you, do you note something, Holmes?
Scent.
Perfume.
Yes.
I noticed it the moment we entered the room.
Claire de Luna.
One of the rarer essences and very expensive.
That woman again.
Undoubtedly.
Get me Inspector Lestrade.
Sherlock Holmes calling.
So Holmes is finally stumped.
First time I've heard him call for help.
Call for help indeed.
He's only just beginning his investigation.
Lestrade?
This is Holmes.
Check the records and place a call made on my private telephone of Bakers Street approximately twelve o'clock on the night of Dr. Tobel's arrival in London.
Finally stumped, hey Sir Reginald.
Yes, Lestrade?
Wait a minute.
Charlotte Eberli,
St. George's Street,
Flat B.
Excellent, Lestrade.
Thank you.
Where is Dr. Tobel?
I can't tell you.
You mean you won't tell me?
I don't know.
How many
Christmas packages did you take to him, Ms. Eberli?
Five.
He dismantled his bomb sight and packed the units in four of the boxes.
Is that correct?
Pardon me.
Hello.
Yes.
This is Miss Eberli.
Why, why someone must have stolen it.
On Richmond Bypass?
Yes.
Yes, I'll arrange to have it removed.
Yes.
At once.
Now I can be frank with you, Mr. Holmes.
Dr. Tobel has disappeared.
They found my car on
Richmond Bypass wrecked.
I loaned it to him last night.
For what purpose,
Miss Eberli?
He wouldn't tell me, but he said that if anything should happen to him
I was to give you this.
Holmes?
Then he must have expected something.
Yes.
This envelope has been opened and resealed.
But that is in impossible.
It hasn't been out of my hands.
What?
Why that's not the message.
It isn't even the same paper.
I saw Dr. Tobel draw little sets of figures.
What kind of figures?
Well they, they looked like little dancing men.
Dancing men?
That's curious.
Who's been in this apartment since Dr. Tobel entrusted that envelope to your care?
Why no one.
I've had no visitors.
Think.
Possibly a tradesman.
No.
Only the one for a few minutes.
And that one?
A workman.
He came to fix my light switch.
He couldn't have possibly...
Did you send for him?
Why no.
My lights went out and soon afterwards he knocked at my door and told me the porter had sent him up.
That's where he worked.
But he wasn't alone in this room more than five minutes and he did fix the lights.
They went on again.
The switch hasn't been touched.
The paint still covers the screw heads.
He simply threw the main switch in the basement, pretended to work on this one and after a few moments an accomplice threw the main switch back on.
But in those few minutes
- Did you get a look at his face?
No, only a glance.
Now I realize he kept his face averted.
But he was a large man?
Yes, he was large.
His eyes, heavy lidded, a thin film over the pupils.
And Holmes...
I remember now.
His eyes, they were like a snake's.
Miss Eberli,
Dr. Tobel is being held by one of the most brilliant men in the history of crime.
Come on, Watson.
There isn't a moment to lose.
Goodbye Miss Eberli.
Goodbye Miss Eberli.
I don't see why I'm not allowed to go with you.
You have your own mission, Watson.
Yes, to take a sealed note to Inspector Lestrade while you search through holes.
I shall not be searching for him.
I shall permit him to find me in the character of a murderous lascar once in his employ and whom I may add is still in jail.
Yes, but after all these years.
Make no mistake, Watson.
This is not a duel of intellects or the cruel but single-minded
Gestapo killer.
This is our greatest problem with England as the stake and our antagonist,
Professor Moriarity.
You've got to beat him.
Once he's behind bars
I think I shall entitle my memoirs of these adventures the end of Moriarity.
An excellent title, Watson, but we must arrange that it isn't Moriarity who's left to write the memoirs.
Huh?
Ramsing.
Ramsing?
Who know Ramsing?
I do, you blooming wharf rat.
You've been in jail, ain't ya?
How you know?
I've heard from the blighter what left you to swing instead of him.
You know who
I'm mean matey.
I know.
I'll have to kill him.
Would it be worth ten pounds to you?
You know where he live?
For ten pound I know.
I only got two.
Goodbye matey
Five.
Ten pounds or nothing you lying heathen.
You dirty...
Well it ain't so much to ask, for what you want to know.
You make good bargain.
That does it.
Well?
You remember
Angel's Court.
Huh.
Then follow your nose through the alley till you come to Jed
Brady's Carpenter Shop.
He can tell you where the blighter is at this very moment.
You come too.
Me?
If you lie.
All right, mister.
I'll come along with you.
Easy matey, easy.
Follow me.
Please governor.
I hadn't had nothing to eat for two days.
Ah, go away.
Who's there?
Peg leg.
Who's this bloke?
He's a bloodthirsty heathen but has good money to spend for information.
What's he want to know?
He give me five pounds to bring him to someone what could tell him the whereabouts of you know who.
You no tell me
I cut two throat.
Cost you another fiver.
Five pound more, eh?
You pay him?
Me?
Come on you.
Come on pay him.
I'll tell you all right I will, the truth and that's a fact.
The blight is in
Davey Jones' locker and feeding the fishes he is, deader than a blinking mackerel.
Now ain't that worth a fiver?
I tell you he's alive.
And I say he's been dead these many years.
You're lying.
Easy there Jack Brady.
I would say you were wrong and Mr. Sherlock
Holmes was correct.
Good evening
Professor Moriarity.
Welcome, Holmes.
My men have the instructions to bring anybody here who inquires for me.
They haggled while I watch, an admirable disguise by the way.
It fooled them completely.
Of course it didn't fool me.
I never intended that it should.
I meant only that it should bring us face to face.
Just like old times, eh?
The battle of wits of superior intellects.
I may say I've been expecting you since I made off with your precious Dr. Tobel.
And his code.
Ah yes.
And his code.
But valuable as your doctor and his code are to my business
I think my main interest in this affair is the chance it gives me to battle with you again.
Moriarity, this is no simple crime that you contemplate.
It's a staggering blow against your own country.
That doesn't concern me overly.
I should make greater profits from this affair than all my other adventures put together.
Then you refuse?
Oh, most assuredly.
In fact,
I intend to insure the success of this venture tonight by liquidating you, Mr. Holmes.
I think that is the
American phrase.
Quite.
You are the one man intelligent enough to stand in my way.
Huh, a gun.
Oh, come now.
This is not the
Professor Moriarity, the master criminal
I once knew.
A dock rat could do as much.
Did you think I was going to shoot you, Mr. Holmes?
Oh, oh.
Dear me no.
This is simply to prevent a troublesome scene.
I expected you, and made full arrangements.
You see my good
Mr. Holmes, these shelves lift out and you will rest somewhat uncomfortably in the false bottom of this sea chest.
My sailor friend,
Jack Brady, goes to sea immediately.
Once out of sight of land he pushes the chest overboard.
Tie him up.
Perhaps your good friend, Dr. Watson, can entitle this adventure, the end of
Sherlock Holmes.
He will be disappointed.
He intended to call it the end of
Professor Moriarity.
Hurry.
Aye, sir.
Brilliant man
Sherlock Holmes.
Too bad he was honest.
That one-legged man, he takes Mr. Holmes right to that carpenter shop.
He knocks on the door.
A man comes out and in they go.
Thank you, George.
We'll take over the watch.
Good night, Dr. Watson.
Good night.
What does Mr. Holmes hope to accomplish by this masquerade?
He hopes to frighten Moriarity into rushing Tobel into another hiding place.
Moriarity's dead,
I tell you.
Look out.
Over here, quick.
Hey, just a minute.
Who's there?
What have you got there?
Who's asking?
Scotland Yard.
Scot... governor, I'll show you me papers.
There you are, governor.
I'm Jack Brady, ship's carpenter.
Shipping out tonight in the convoy, destination unknown.
Me pal here is helping me get the chest aboard.
Make him open it, Lestrade.
Yes, or course.
All right governor, see for yourself.
There is nothing here, doctor.
Just a couple of simple seafaring men.
All right get on with it.
Thank you governor.
Come on, now.
Easy does it.
Right there.
Good night, my lordships.
Told you it was a lot of nonsense.
I don't understand.
That thing must weight a ton.
Look at that man staggering.
Do you know something, doctor.
A few tools wouldn't take that much energy.
We've just looked inside.
On the top only.
There might be a false bottom.
Hey you, you stop there.
Stop or I'll shoot.
Great Scott, Holmes.
Well I'll be blowed.
You're not hurt.
No, but you needn't have yelled at them so abruptly.
Huh?
They dropped me on my head.
Oh.
Moriarity would have been delighted.
So Professor
Moriarity is alive.
Alive and in possession of Dr. Tobel's code.
No point going back, they've all gone.
Then what are you going to do?
Well first I'm going to wash this filthy stuff off my face and then I'm going to see Miss Eberli again.
I've got to find some clue to the content of
Dr. Tobel's message.
Come on quick.
I only got one glimpse of the note while he was preparing it.
He was seated at this desk?
No, he was sitting on the couch when he wrote the message but he sealed the envelope here.
The message was written in ink with this pen?
No he used a pencil.
This one.
Thank you.
He used this writing pad?
Yes.
Has it been used since?
No.
It should be here.
It must be here.
What, Mr. Holmes.
The lead in this pencil is hard, hard enough to make an impression on the course fibers of which this paper is made.
Impressions at the moment are invisible.
If we immerse this sheet in the solution of florescent salts, dry it and then photograph it by ultraviolet light the fibers broken by the writing will absorbed less of the solution than other parts of the paper.
Switch off the lights, Watson.
We place the slide in the projector and turn on the light.
The broken fibers appear darken than the rest of the paper and therefore visible.
Splendid, Holmes.
Now I recognize that code.
Do you remember a case we had some years ago?
It's partly the same, alphabet substitution code.
Yes, Watson.
I believe Dr. Tobel meant to communicate with us by that means.
Substitution of the alphabet.
I don't understand.
My dear, one of the oldest codes in use is based on the repetition of figures.
E is a letter most used in the British language therefore the single most used probably in this message is e.
T-a-o-i-n.
Follow in that order of frequency.
You mean you can read these figures as if they were letters of the alphabet.
Elementary, my dear Miss Eberli.
Give me one minute and you shall have the message.
And what is the message, Watson?
This fellow Tobel must have been pulling our legs.
There's a lot of gibberish.
L-y-z-l-m-t-h-k.
Reads like an eye doctor's chart.
Dr. Tobel is a brilliant scientist.
I saw immediately that he wouldn't send us a message so simple to decipher.
Neither would he have fixed these top figures without a meaning.
Then it isn't the alphabet substitution code.
Yes it is, Watson, but with a very clever variation.
You see the one, two, three figures means that we skip letters in that order.
In other words, observe Watson.
The first letter, which is I skips one, becomes J.
The second letter, Y, skips two and becomes A and the third skips three and becomes C.
J-a-c...
J-a-c-o-b, D-u-r-r-e-i.
Jacob Durrei, a
Swiss scientist and friend of
Dr. Tobel's.
P-a-l-a-c-e, C-r-e-s...
Palace Crescent.
Right.
I say Holmes, this man, Durrei, must be important.
Obviously, Watson.
He must have some connection with the bomb sight or Tobel wouldn't have taken so much trouble to see that
I got his name.
Take down the rest of the message.
J-o-s-e-p-h, Joseph.
E-m-d-d-i-a-c, number four doesn't make any sense.
He must have used some other variations.
Four names and addresses,
Jacob Durrei,
Professor Fallow,
Dr. Kern and this forth infernal cipher which doesn't get the code.
Christmas boxes.
Watson, I'm beginning to see the plan.
Dr. Tobel divided his bomb sight into four parts just as we brought it back from Switzerland.
He's given one section of the mechanism to each of these famous scientists.
What a fascinating plan.
You see each part is useless without the other three and undoubtedly none of these scientists is known to each other.
Professor Moriarity also has the code and we must allow for his ability to decipher it.
We haven't time to break the fourth code now.
We must get to the first three men before Moriarity does.
Palace Crescent first?
Right.
I'll go and get a taxi.
Miss Eberli, will you please wait here till we return?
Thank you.
Yeah, where are you going, sir?
Jacob Durrei live here?
Yes, but there's been a bit of trouble so you can't go in.
Inspector
Lestrade's orders.
Oh, Hey, just a minute, sir.
That's Mr.
Sherlock Holmes.
Oh, very sorry, sir.
Dead?
Dead as a door nail.
Mr. Holmes, how did you know about this?
The Yard only got here fifteen minutes ago.
We'd better hurry Holmes.
There's still time to save Fallow and Kern.
Too late, Watson.
By this time Fallow and Kern are dead too.
What?
Deductions again,
Mr. Holmes?
Facts Inspector.
Oh, facts.
But how did you know about them?
Elementary, my dear Watson.
This man has been dead for at least two hours and Moriarity isn't wasting any time.
Hello?
This is Lestrade.
Put me on to Mackety.
Hello, Mackety, hello, this is Lestrade.
Do you know anything about two men named
Fallow and Kern?
Fallow and Kern?
Both of them?
Oh.
Thank you.
The report only came in two seconds before
I telephoned.
What on earth are we going to do, Holmes?
Moriarity's got a big start and he's got the code?
Note this Watson.
Scotland Yard reports two murderers.
That makes three in all.
But there were four boxes and four codes.
Obviously Moriarity hasn't broken the fourth code either.
What is the name of the fourth man?
I can't remember.
What is the name of the fourth man?
I have forgotten.
What is the name of the fourth man?
I don't know.
I don't know.
What is the name of the fourth man?
I can't remember.
What is the name of the fourth man?
What is the name of the fourth man?
But Holmes, don't you realize what this means to England?
We not only lose the
Tobel bomb sight ourselves but Germany gets it.
Coventry, Bath,
Plymouth, London.
And not to mention Norigno.
All over again but with ten times the effect.
Don't you suppose
I realize that,
Sir Reginald?
Don't you suppose
I give my life to decode the last name of that message?
Well there must be some solution.
Naturally, Watson.
I don't mean to be rude, I need a drink.
I'm all in.
I can't think anymore.
All these letters and figures running through my brain all twisted around.
Twisted around.
What?
That's it.
That's what?
Twisted around you said.
It's so simple I never thought of it.
Reverse the slide.
You see, gentlemen.
These figures are now identical with the first three names.
In other words, all the figures of name number four are written backwards and read from right to left until we reverse the slide when they read correctly from left to right.
Now let's work on it.
Pencil Watson.
But, um, why would Dr. Tobel want to reverse the figures of number four.
An added precaution, Lestrade in case the cipher should fall into the wrong hands.
Quite a compliment to you, Mr. Holmes.
I mean, Tobel taken for granted that you would recognize the difference.
Thank you.
Ohh.
F-r-e-d-e-r-i-c-k,
H-o-f-f-n-e-r,
Frederick Hoffner.
S-l-o-a-n-e S-q-u...
Sloane Square.
We must leave at once.
Wait a minute.
Information?
Will you please give me the address of a Frederick Hoffner in Sloane Square.
I'll break this code.
I'll find the name of that fourth man before Holmes does.
There is not much more time.
The submarine is to pick us up off Shanese in six hours.
I've beaten Holmes so far.
We don't need the confounded submarine with the bomber sight in tact.
But Tobel is unconscious again.
As last resort we could abandon the code and take Tobel to Germany.
We'll try Tobel again in here.
Wait.
Spilling that glass of water was a very fortunate accident, my dear street brawler.
Dr. Tobel's perversion of the cipher was so simple that it fooled us.
I was looking for something ingenious.
This is ingenious.
He simply reversed the cipher.
F-r-e-d-e-r-i-c-k,
H-o-f-f-n-e-r,
S-l-o-a-n-e.
Frederick Hoffner,
Sloane Square.
Of course.
Hoffner would be the perfect selection.
Then you want us to tend to Hoffner?
No, we can use Hoffner.
He's a brilliant scientist.
If Dr. Tobel doesn't recover from your persuasion,
Hoffner would be able to put the four parts together.
You and Godfrey will call on Hoffner and you will bring him here with the fourth section of the bomb sight.
Hurry.
Put up your hands,
Professor Hoffner.
I'll take the box.
We Meet again, Professor.
Sherlock Holmes.
An improvement on the other make-up.
Don't you think so, Professor.
So you think you've beaten me, Holmes?
I have.
The real Hoffner is safely in the hands of
Scotland Yard.
But I still have Tobel and now I shall sell
Germany the inventor instead of the invention.
You've learned nothing from him in spite of all your torture otherwise you wouldn't be trying so desperately to collect the four sections of the bomb sight.
A keen observation, my dear Holmes, but observe further that you are now in my hands and I have profited by my last mistake by allowing underlings to attend to you.
Holmes took my place and while the Nazis were inside with him he instructed me to attach a small apparatus underneath their car.
He's a brilliant fellow, Holmes.
I helped him prepare the apparatus.
Did you really, doctor?
That is I poured the luminous paint when he told me to.
Very clever, Dr. Watson.
The apparatus drips at regular intervals leaving a trail of luminous paint.
I see.
Leading us to Moriarity and Mr. Holmes.
Why are you so confident, Professor?
Only a suggestion.
But how do you know that Scotland Yard isn't waiting to break in at this very moment?
I selected this address with special care.
No one can find it, not even Scotland Yard.
Relax, Mr. Holmes.
There's no escape.
And I'd suddenly dash to the window and break it open and shout to a passerby.
There are no passersby.
The glass in the window is unbreakable and the room is soundproof.
This is my stronghold, Holmes, equipped with all the modern conveniences of a successful man in my profession.
Sit down.
They cleared up again, sir.
I don't understand,
Lestrade.
It stopped and then it started and now it stopped again.
Maybe the apparatus broke down.
Oh, a suggestion, gentlemen.
At a crossroad back there a car might have gone over the spots of paint, picked some up on the tires and left this false trail.
Just what
I was about to...
Just what I was about to suggest myself.
Very well.
We'll try it.
Now Holmes, what will it be?
The gas chamber, a cup of hemlock or just a simple bullet through your brain?
You disappoint me, professor.
Indeed.
Yes.
Somehow I always thought that in the end you'd prove to be just an ordinary cutthroat.
You know me better, Holmes.
Gas, poison, bullets.
I assure you, professor, were our position's reversed
I should have something more colorful, more imaginative to offer.
I'm satisfied to be the winner.
I shall be alive.
Alive, yes, the winner, no, for in the last analysis
I shall have proved the more resourceful man.
You didn't trap me here.
I came here because
I wanted to, to prevent your getting Hoffner and all you can do in return is to commit ordinary murder to relieve your sense of frustration.
And what, my good Mr. Holmes, could you have conceived that would have been so much more colorful?
Well even offhand
I can improve upon your suggestions considerably, but that's only natural of course.
And what is this brilliant idea of yours?
You know that a man dies if he loses five pints of blood?
Yes, of course you do.
I should have you placed on an operating table, inject a needle into your veins and slowly draw off your life's blood.
The needle to the last, ay, Holmes?
Slowly, drop-by-drop the blood would be drawn from your body.
You would be aware of every exquisite second to the very end.
You would be watching yourself die scientifically noting every reaction and in full possession of your faculties.
Interesting.
Yes, isn't it.
I humbly submit, professor, that to the very end
I've been more resourceful than yourself.
You've played into my hands,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Time and again I've used this place as a haven for friends of mine injured in alterations with Scotland Yard.
I have a fully equipped hospital here.
The trail goes this way, inspector.
Drop by drop, Holmes.
Drop by drop.
Ahh, in a way
I'm almost sorry.
You were a stimulating influence to me but it was obvious that
I should win in the end.
Only a matter of moments now.
Take Tobel down to the boat.
Start the engine.
Closer to the end Holmes, closer and closer.
Each second a few more drops leave your desiccated body ending, you can feel me touch you.
You're perfectly conscious aren't you, Holmes?
I shall be conscious long after you're dead, Moriarity.
Ahh.
Still the same old swaggering conceded
Sherlock Holmes.
Wait.
If Moriarity hears a shot he'll kill Holmes.
You keep an eye on the boat.
Don't make a move till Dr. Watson and I get inside.
Understand?
You wait here,
Professor Hoffner.
Come on doctor.
The water's this way.
Moriarity's rooms must be up here.
I can't wait any longer, Holmes.
You'll have to forgive the crudity my friend.
This is only the coups de gras.
[Shot]
Stay still, Moriarity.
You're done for.
Holmes!
On the contrary, inspector, my men are outside.
It's you who are done for.
Really?
Just take a look out the window and see for yourself.
He's trying to get to the speedboat.
Yes, he won't go without Tobel.
Wait.
Here's Dr.
Tobel, inspector.
He ain't too badly hurt.
Thank heavens for that.
Look after him will you Hoffner?
I'll take him to the car.
Well I expected you but not with my revolver.
You realize, of course, when I was brought into the room blindfolded
I heard the mechanism of this door.
Of course.
And yet knowing that I'd heard it you planned this way of escape.
Not very flattering to me.
Suicide my dear professor.
Not at all, my dear Holmes.
You see this is not an ordinary passageway.
Oh, my mistake.
It has been equally well prepared as the rest of my humble quarters.
I have a trap set, electric eye principle.
My passing through will break the beam and automatically open the highly deceptive trap door behind me, of course.
My pursuer, meaning you my dear Holmes, will then be plunged sixty feet into the sewers below.
Holmes.
Holmes.
Poor Moriarity.
I neglected to warn him.
It seems some careless person came across his trap door and left it open.
Come along, Watson.
Germany wanted the
Tobel bomb sight, but will send her thousands of them in our airplanes.
Yes, thanks to
Mr. Sherlock Holmes and to Mrs. Tobel.
And, of course,
Inspector Lestrade.
Oh well, that's all right, Miss.
Things are looking up, Holmes.
This little islands still on the map.
Yes.
This fortress built by nature for herself, this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.
- Code message, sir.
- Thanks.
- Harper, code message.
- Yes, sir.
All right, everything clear to the pilots?
- Major Roberts.
- Yes, Quincannon?
- Gonna use the radio beam all the way?
- Yes.
Flight leaders will work Hickam radio control...
...while the other planes work the home station. How about the navigators?
- One question, sir.
- How soon...?
- Sorry.
- Hauser?
How soon will we get our maps and charts, sir?
Anytime you want them. You'll be given the route weather forecast soon.
- Wendell?
- That's what I wanted to know, sir.
Any questions from the bombardiers?
- Major Roberts, sir.
- Parker.
- What about ammunition?
- No ammunition.
- Yes, McMartin?
- Are we taking bombsights along?
We're ferrying them fully equipped except for ammunition.
Maintenance crews are working on them.
Pilots, check with them to be sure everything's in shape.
- And Harper, you'll check for us.
- Yes, sir.
I guess that's all for now.
Oh, yes. The crews haven't been told yet what the destination is, so keep it quiet.
- Anything else?
- How about phoning our wives, sir?
Evidently your copilot doesn't take you into his confidence.
He got permission to send a radiogram to Lieutenant McMartin's sister in Honolulu.
I thought that might interest you,
McMartin.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I guess that's about all.
We'll meet here 30 minutes before takeoff time for final instructions.
- How's everything, sergeant?
- Everything's going fine, sir.
Gotta put a new magneto on number two.
Gear's shot.
They told me to get her ready for a long trip.
- They didn't tell me where.
- They didn't, huh?
- No, sir.
- Can you keep a secret, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
- That's good.
Captain Quincannon?
Private Chester reporting, sir.
Second radio.
Sergeant White, your crew chief.
- How are you?
- How do you do?
- Glad to have you with us.
- I'm glad to be assigned to your airplane.
I've been hoping to get on a Flying Fortress since radio school.
- How long ago was that?
- Three months ago.
I've had experience.
I've been in light bombers.
That's fine.
Better turn him over to Peterson, sergeant.
He can look over the radio set and get the hang of things.
- I'll be in Operations if you want me.
- Yes, sir.
You'll find Peterson inside, son.
- Must be a big flight. Nine Fortresses.
- So they say.
Do you know...?
I mean, can you tell me where we're going?
- Can... Can you keep a secret?
- Oh, yes, sir.
That's good.
- Hello.
- Hello. Are you the new gunner?
- No, second radio.
- Yeah?
- My name's Weinberg, second engineer.
- Chester's my name. Glad to know you.
- Glad to know you.
- Hey, is that what they call her, Mary-Ann?
That's her.
And she's the best ship in the outfit.
Hey, Peterson, here's your new static chaser.
- My name's Chester.
- How are you?
Come on, I'll show you around.
- Hey, you the crew chief?
- Yeah.
My name's White.
Are you the new gunner?
Yeah, Winocki. Joe Winocki.
We've been expecting you.
Put your stuff inside.
- Okay.
- You're lucky.
- Our regular gunner's on furlough.
- I wouldn't say I'm lucky.
- Looks like everything's okay, sergeant.
- I think so, sir.
- How about coffee and sandwiches?
- Got them, sir.
- I wish we could get ahold of extra oxygen.
- Already inside the plane, sir.
- How'd you do that?
- Six bottles.
- You haven't got an extra engine, have you?
- Almost enough parts to build one, I guess.
I'm getting sort of worried about my wife.
She should be here by now.
Oh, Winocki.
- Yeah?
- This is our new gunner, sir.
Captain Quincannon.
- Don't I know you, sergeant?
- I think you do, sir.
- You were at Randolph Field?
- That's right.
- About two years ago?
- Two and a half, sir.
- While I was instructing there.
- That's right.
- Oh, I remem...
- I think you remember.
- Anything else, sir?
- Not now, no.
Anyhow, I guess that new radioman of ours is a pretty good kid.
- Yeah, I guess he is.
- We're getting them right off the bottle.
We were all pretty young when we started out.
How old is that kid of yours you talk about?
- Twenty-one.
- Where is he stationed?
Clark Field, Manila.
They got him in one of those Peashooters.
Just got a boost too.
If he gets another bar on his shoulders, you're gonna have to have a bigger head.
- Imagine me saluting my own kid.
- You'd pin his ears down if he didn't take it.
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind if...?
Well, my mother would like to meet you.
Sure.
Mother, this is Captain Quincannon.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Mighty nice of you to turn out at this time of night to see us off.
I wanted to meet you, captain, because...
...well, I couldn't help wondering what kind of a...
- You'll take good care of him, won't you?
- In a way, he'll be looking after me.
That's the way the crew of a bomber functions.
- I wouldn't worry any.
- I won't.
We haven't much time left, Chester.
Don't worry about our radioman.
It's a routine flight.
- He'll be back in a couple of weeks.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Chester.
- Goodbye.
I'll write to you, Mom, so you'll know where I am.
Did you bring this for me?
Take care of yourself, Mom.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.
Goodbye, son.
Goodbye, Mom.
Haven't seen Mrs. Quincannon, have you?
- I haven't. I've been watching, sir.
- Well, I guess I've been ditched.
- You better get aboard, Chester.
- Yes, sir.
Irish!
- Irish.
- It's about time, Mrs. Quincannon.
- Did you have another date?
- Flat tire. You ever try to get a taxi here?
- I was scared I wouldn't make it.
- So was I.
And I couldn't bring Michael. It's a little too late for him, but he sent you this.
And this.
Thanks.
- Darling, couldn't I stow away?
- Do you wanna get me court-martialed?
I'll be back in a couple weeks.
We'll take time off for that honeymoon.
I remember every honeymoon we didn't have. Even the first one.
So do I.
You haven't got much chance to be bored with me.
Oh, I'll never get bored with you, Irish.
It's been fun, every minute of it.
Such good fun.
- I guess I'm just lucky.
- Me too.
Irish, when you go out in the rain, you'll remember to wear your rubbers, won't you?
Sure, I will.
I'll be waiting.
So long, kid.
- Better stow this stuff over there, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
- Get that ladder aboard, will you, Weinberg?
- Okay.
- Hey, what's that thing for?
- You never know where your luck is.
That's from
Michael Aloysius Quincannon, Jr.
- Everybody in?
- Yes, sir.
- Doors closed?
- Yes, sir.
- Lockpins out?
- Yes, sir.
- Check controls for free movement.
- Check.
- Roberts to flight, check-in in order.
- Two ready.
- Three okay.
- Four okay.
- Five okay.
- Eight ready.
- Nine okay.
- Okay, start engines.
All set here, sir.
- Only need one shot, sir. Kind of warm.
- Okay.
Number one.
Number two.
01104 to control tower.
Take-off instructions for flight of nine B-17s.
- Sir, is this a local flight?
- No, this is not a local flight.
Okay to taxi up to north end of ramp.
Use runway two-eight.
Wind west, one-five. Go ahead.
Roger.
Roberts to flight, all planes follow me.
Use runway 28. Wind west, 15 miles.
Take off at 30-second intervals.
Let's go.
- Looks like they're gonna run all right.
- Thank you, sir.
- Check the tail wheel, will you, Robbie?
- Yes, sir.
- I'm going upstairs.
- Okay, Tommy.
Don't get us lost.
Want any help running this thing?
- Hi, Tommy. How's Monk doing?
- Knee-deep in maps.
Well, looks like you got your date, all right.
They say that Hawaiian moon's awful big.
Better watch out, Tommy, or he'll be your brother-in-law.
No, Susan's a smart girl.
She won't marry beneath herself.
Go on, you can't make me mad.
Take a last look.
- Goodbye, San Francisco.
- Hello, Honolulu.
Hey, there's the Golden Gate.
Christmas crackers.
That's an awful big town, San Francisco.
Strictly a one-whistle stop.
There's only one city in the U.S.A.
And that's New York.
Oh, you're just another hometown hick,
Weinberg.
- What's wrong with California?
- California?
The sun shines and nothing ever happens.
Before you know it you're 60 years old.
It's no different from New York.
My sister's been trying to get out of Brooklyn for 40 years.
Brooklyn? That ain't New York.
Once you cross that Brooklyn Bridge, you're out of this world.
The only noise you hear is the hardening of your arteries.
When I used to drive a hack...
...I had a pal who crossed that bridge back in 1929.
- I ain't heard from him since.
- Me, I'll take Minneapolis.
Minneapolis?
Why, the grass still grows in the streets.
Besides, that ain't your hometown,
Peterson.
The hayseed's still sticking out of your hair.
Yeah, but I can still milk a cow.
I bet you can't.
I'll get mine out of a bottle. That's the closest I ever wanna be to a cow.
You're handy with the old bull.
Gee. Gee, we're sure lucky.
- Why? What do you mean?
- Oh, this whole trip.
Well, what about it?
Oh, a million fellas would give anything to be in our shoes right now.
Why?
I don't mean just this flight.
I mean, well...
Everything we've got to look forward to.
How far do you think you'll get as an enlisted man?
A lot of enlisted men get commissions.
Look at the training you get, and the experience too.
Look, if you don't go through flying school, you don't rate.
- I don't believe that.
- I know.
- Well, what are you in it for?
- Not for long.
I've had enough.
I'm getting out next month.
- You're getting out, huh?
- Yup.
- Well, I'm not.
- That's right, stay with it.
You stick to what you believe in, kid.
Don't listen to guys like him.
What are you gonna be in another 20 years, sergeant? A brigadier?
No. But my boy is.
Him and me sort of like the old Air Corps.
You stay in the box, son, and keep right on pitching.
Yeah.
Coming up forward, kid?
Yeah. Keep right on pitching.
- Everybody all right?
- Fine, sir.
- Good.
- Coffee, captain?
Yeah, please.
- Thanks, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- You want some coffee, Winocki?
- No, thanks.
- How's it going?
- All right, sir.
- I want to talk with you.
- Sure. Can I talk too?
Sure, go ahead. Get it off your chest.
- I want to get things straight with you.
- I think I'm straight.
- I don't know if you are, sir.
- I think I know what's bothering you.
- Do you?
- Yeah. And in a way, I don't blame you.
- You wanted to fly, be a pilot, didn't you?
- Who doesn't?
- You had your chance.
- Did I?
- Yeah. You blew it.
- That's what you think.
You couldn't make it. You scraped around a while. When the going got tough...
Yeah, and you threw me up for grabs.
I didn't run you into Driscoll's plane and cut his tail off.
- Oh, I know it was an accident, but...
- For which you washed me out of school.
I could have been flying one of these if it hadn't been for that.
I didn't wash you out, the board washed you out.
- On your recommendation.
- You lacked flying ability.
You should have been eliminated sooner.
I want you to know that nobody held you responsible for Driscoll's death.
- Except you, sir.
- Not me either.
Get that out of your head.
Now, look, Winocki...
...there are two other men on this ship who washed out as pilots.
McMartin's a bombardier, Hauser went in for navigation. They're both good.
You're a good gunner or you wouldn't have the rating.
We need you like we need the whole gang.
It takes all of us to make this ship function.
Now, get this into your head:
We all belong to this airplane.
Every man has got to rely on every other man to do the right thing at the right time.
You played football, Winocki.
You know how one man can gum up the whole works.
You gotta play ball with us, play the game, or I'm gonna get rid of you.
Nice speech.
But my enlistment runs out in three weeks.
- You're quitting, huh?
- Yes, sir.
Well, that's your privilege.
But until that time, you're still in the Army.
Don't you forget it.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry for you, Winocki.
- Anything else, sir?
- No, that's all.
Oh, Peterson, if you want entertainment, tune in on the broadcast frequencies.
- I'll stay on the command set.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
San Francisco. Mr. Litvinoff, the new
Russian ambassador to the United States...
... arrived yesterday
on the China Clipper...
... and departed immediately for the capital
to confer with the president.
Washington, D.C.
Tension in the Pacific and the Far East
has relaxed...
... as a result of the peaceful mission of
Japan's special envoy, Mr. Saburo Kurusu.
Mr. Kurusu and Admiral Nomura
have assured the press...
... that Japan's intentions
are wholly peaceful.
They will meet again tomorrow
with Secretary of State Cordell Hull.
Seattle, Washington.
A final labor conference
was held here this morning...
Weather report from Hickam Field, sir.
- Did you get a good sleep, Chester?
- Not much, sir.
I didn't wanna miss anything.
- How's the kid doing, sergeant?
- Fine, sir.
He likes the ship and I guess Mary-Ann likes him.
Good. How about Winocki?
I can't make him out.
No, sir.
Thanks, Chester.
Beg pardon, sir. Isn't that a picture of Captain Monk Hauser?
Yeah.
- Well, that's...
- My father.
Gosh, I'm pretty dumb.
I should have realized.
- Well, there's not much resemblance.
- Oh, sure there is. I can see it now.
I've seen him in a book I got about the Lafayette Escadrille.
- Yeah, he was in it.
- Yeah, he sure was.
- Gee, he could sure fly.
- Yeah.
I wish I could fly like him.
Yes, sir.
Well, it won't be long now before you see Diamond Head...
...sticking out of that ocean.
Suits Weinberg.
I used to dream about getting out of traffic jams...
...and going someplace where a guy would have elbow room.
But this is overdoing it.
Two thousand miles and I ain't seen a fish.
I kind of like it.
- Like being on the prairies when I was a kid.
- Funny thing.
I never thought there was nothing west of Manhattan except Jersey.
- I can use some of that coffee.
- I was just talking to the navigator.
- You know who his father was?
- Sure. Monk Hauser.
- Who's that?
- How old were you in the last war?
Older than you.
I was over on the other side.
And you never heard of Monk Hauser with Eddie Rickenbacker's squadron?
Well, what do you know?
Was that Lieutenant Hauser's old man?
That's him. I knew him. He was plenty good till they knocked him down.
Yeah, he sure was.
- Well, why ain't this kid of his a pilot?
- Tried too hard.
Yeah, like a lot of others.
- That's funny.
- What?
Hickam radio went off right in the middle of a weather report.
- Maybe it faded out.
- It didn't sound like it.
- What is it? What is it?
- Wait.
Hey, Peterson, who you got tuned in,
Orson Welles?
- Shut up.
- Now...
Shut up.
Better tell the captain.
Radio operator to pilot.
Radio operator to pilot.
- Go ahead.
- Sir, Hickam Field's off the air.
I don't know what I've picked up.
You can listen in on R-2.
- What's that?
- I don't know.
- Chinese?
- No, Japs.
Number four to Major Roberts.
Number four to Major Roberts.
Stand by, Irish. I hear it.
Keep off the air.
01104 to Hickam radio.
01104 to Hickam radio.
Hickam radio, answer.
Hickam radio, answer, please.
01104 to Hickam radio.
A flight of B- 17s to Hickam
want landing instructions.
Hickam radio, answer, please.
Give me landing instructions
for a flight of B- 17s.
Hickam radio, give me a call, please.
01104 to Hickam radio.
Silence your radio!
Keep away from the field!
We're being attacked by enemy aircraft.
We're being attacked by enemy aircraft.
Land elsewhere. Land elsewhere.
Roberts to flight.
We're going into emergency fields.
You know where they are.
I'll take the one furthest north, number nine, furthest south...
...the rest of you, in between.
Get on the ground and stay there till you're clear.
You're on your own.
Peterson, send the crew chief up here right away.
Get the rubber boats ready.
Pass out.45s and ammunition.
- Where do we go, Monk?
- Turn 120 degrees until I figure it out.
Okay, 120 degrees she is.
- I wish we were there.
- Yeah.
- If we only had machine-gun loads.
- I still got a throwing arm.
I'll heave a wrench if any of them come our way.
Get the rubber boats ready.
- Pass out side arms.
- I've done that.
- Tell everybody to keep their eyes open.
- Yes, sir.
Put your life vests on.
Keep an eye out upstairs, kid.
- Put your life vests on, boys.
- Hey, sarge, is this really on the level?
You guess.
Winocki,
I told you to put your life vest on.
Relax, sergeant.
This is some kind of drill, and you know it.
Personally, I wouldn't care if you left it off. Here.
Thanks, brigadier.
- Navigator to pilot.
- Go ahead.
Change course to 135. We ought to be on the ground at Maui in 22 minutes.
Right, 135.
This one really is smaller than a postage stamp.
Little more. That's about it.
- Looks like it here.
- Hold it there.
- Think it'll work, sergeant?
- It'll hold all right, sir.
- We gotta see if she'll retract.
- Because I made a mess out of the landing.
A wonder you got her in at all, sir.
This field wasn't built for the Mary-Ann.
Hey, captain, something's moving over there in the brush.
Why, it's the lieutenants.
- You fellas look like you've had a trip.
- We did.
- Yeah, where's the water?
- Right here.
- You find the other field?
- Yeah, but no ammunition.
- How many of our flight there?
- Two. Both of them okay.
- Hi, there, Tommy.
- Hi.
- That accounts for everybody.
- Yeah.
Two more landed at Molokai, and Roberts and the rest made Hickam.
- Cracked-up landing. Nobody was hurt.
- What have you heard?
- Nothing since noon.
- Sound bad at Hickam?
Doesn't sound good.
We had a little trouble ourselves on the way back.
- What?
- Somebody took a crack at us.
- What do you mean?
- Just that.
We saw men in a cane field and headed for them.
- They started popping away with rifles.
- Local Japs. Friendly fellas.
We lost them back there, three or four miles.
I hope you did.
- Better get back to your bombsight, Tommy.
- Yeah.
Step on it, sergeant.
- Douse that light! Let's get out of here!
- Knock those wedges out.
Winocki, cut it out.
Knock this one out first.
Got this one.
- All right, shove!
- Shove.
Everybody in the ship!
- How do we get out of this chicken yard?
- We got in, didn't we?
Hey, they ain't kidding.
Did you see that bumblebee?
- Lock it.
- Locked.
Check the tanks and see if they've been hit.
Yes, sir.
All right, all right. Let me alone.
- All right, all right.
- How are you feeling, Winocki?
- I owe you one for this.
- Yeah?
How far do you think you'd have gotten in that brush?
They'd have cut you down before you got to first base.
- Instead, you did it.
- Don't you know this is just a drill?
We could've had a fine scrap with them snipers.
Couple of shots in the right place could have set this ship afire.
Use your head, Winocki, and stop trying to prove something.
My job is tail gunner.
What's yours, lecturing?
No. My job is to keep this thing flying.
05564 to Hickam Field.
05564 to Hickam Field.
Shut off your radio. Stay where you are.
Don't get off the ground.
05564 to Hickam.
Just cleared emergency field on Maui.
- Have to come down.
- Okay.
- Give me a call just before you come in.
- Roger.
Pilot to crew.
Take a good look at Pearl Harbor.
Maybe it's something you'll want to remember.
Damn them. Damn them.
Now ain't you glad you're getting out of the Army?
05564 to Hickam.
- Go ahead.
- Approaching the field from the south.
- Coming in for a landing.
- We won't be able to give you any lights.
- I can get in without them.
- Take the west side near the hangars.
Watch out for bomb craters on the runway.
- Good luck to you.
- Roger.
Pilot to crew. Fasten your safety belts.
- Might be a rough landing.
- All set, sir.
All checked for landing.
- Give me full flaps.
- Flaps coming down.
- Landing lights.
- Lights.
Air speed 110.
One hundred.
- Captain Quincannon, sir.
- How are you, captain?
You made a good landing.
You were told to stay where you were.
- Yes, but we had to get out.
- Why?
- We were being shot at by snipers.
- At Maui?
- We didn't wanna lose the airplane.
- No, no, of course you didn't.
Didn't know about that.
You did the right thing, then.
Well, we've had our troubles around here too, as you can see.
Yes, sir.
They certainly did a complete job of it.
What happened to those P-40s?
Three trucks arrived from Honolulu this morning.
When the first Jap plane showed up, the trucks went down the field...
...smashed the tails off every ship on the land.
They sure had a field day.
Took the first round, but there'll be others.
- Yes, sir.
- Which one of you is McMartin?
- Me, sir.
- I have some bad news for you.
- You're wanted over at the hospital.
- My sister?
Sorry, I didn't get any details except that she asked for Williams and Quincannon too.
Captain, we'll want your ship serviced right away.
- Full gas load, ammunition for guns.
- Yes, sir.
Any repairs needed?
There's a wheel to be checked.
Everything else seems okay.
These men will give you everything.
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir?
You heard what the colonel said.
Anything else?
- This car will take you to the hospital.
- Thank you.
- Who's your navigator?
- I am, sir.
- Come with me. I have a job for you.
- Oh, colonel.
Beg your pardon, sir.
- Glad to see you again, sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
Did they attack Clark Field, Manila, sir?
- I've got a boy there.
- Yes, they hit it all right.
Hit everything in the Pacific.
Guam, Wake, Midway.
I remember your boy, sergeant.
- Twenty-seventh group.
- Yes, sir.
He's a first lieutenant now.
Flight commander.
He's a good pilot, then.
Don't worry. He'll take care of himself.
Thank you, sir. All right, fellas.
We got a job of work to do.
Let's get with it.
- Miss McMartin?
- Right down that way.
Thank you.
I can't see. Why is it so dark?
Hush, child. It's going to be all right.
But I can't see.
I can't see.
- Lieutenant McMartin?
- Yes, nurse.
You can only stay a few minutes.
She needs all the rest she can get.
Sure.
Sue.
Hello, kids.
Why, it's good to see you boys.
I was kind of scared.
I acted like a ninny.
We didn't know whether you had a flat tire or something...
...or couldn't find the place.
Or...
Tommy, Bill, I'm so glad you're here.
- Kind of hurts when I cry.
- Don't, Sue.
I wanted to tell you about...
But I guess I'm kind of tired.
- He'll tell you.
- Who?
Tex.
- Tex Rader.
- What?
Please don't get mad at him.
It was all my fault.
He tried to make me get out of the car, but...
- I guess he'd better tell you.
- Sure.
- Will you come in the morning?
- You bet.
Good night.
Sergeant, do you know where we can find Lieutenant Rader?
Yes, sir. Right this way.
Rader. Rader.
Oh, hello, Tommy.
- Quincannon. How are you, Bill?
- I've been waiting for you. I went to sleep.
We just came from the hospital.
- How is she?
- Not so good.
That's what we came to talk to you about.
- Suppose you do a little explaining.
- Yeah, go on, start.
- Say, what is this, the third degree?
- All right, she said it wasn't his fault.
Don't believe what she said.
It was my fault.
- Should've made her get out of the car.
- What car?
- The one I borrowed for the party.
- What party?
Give him a chance.
We were starting out when the first planes came.
- Couldn't figure it out.
- Up early, weren't you?
- Or out late.
- Listen, will you?
- Say, I don't get...
- Never mind, Rader. Go ahead.
We spotted the planes, and at the same time heard the bombs.
All I could think of was getting to the field.
I told Susan to hop out and get under cover, but she only laughed at me.
- You know how she is.
- Yeah, we know. Go on.
We got near the field, a truck pulled across, blocking the road ahead of us.
It was a delivery truck from Honolulu.
I remember thinking as I jumped out that the driver had been hit.
I was just dumb.
First thing I knew, there was an explosion right in my face.
There was a Jap behind the wheel with a shotgun.
It was a rotten shot. Sloughed him over the head with his own gun.
Got the truck off the road.
Other cars were coming along, trying to get to the field.
Was Susan all right then?
Yeah, but that's when
I should've made her get out.
She took the wheel and went carting off toward the hangars with me hanging on.
Last time I saw her, she was standing up in the car...
...yelling and rooting like she was at a football game.
- How'd she get hurt, then?
- Machine gun.
The soldier who ran out to drag her in was killed.
- What were you doing all that time?
- What do you think?
I notice you're not hurt any.
- Listen, wait a minute.
- Wait a minute, Tommy.
If I stay here, I'll...
Let's go.
- Say, you guys don't think...?
- See you later, Rader.
You wanted to see me, colonel?
- You find something to eat?
- Yes.
- How's your sister, McMartin?
- Pretty weak, sir.
The surgeon says it's hard to tell yet.
I'm going over again when he makes another examination.
No, you aren't. We want this airplane out of here before daylight.
- You're sending us back to the mainland?
- No, Manila.
We're safe here for the moment, and the Philippines are in bad shape.
Our orders are to send them as many B-17s as we can. Can you make it?
- Where do we stop to refuel, sir?
- Wake Island.
I can't promise you how long it'll hold out or what you'll find there.
- Got the charts there, Monk?
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant White.
- Yes, sir?
- How'd the engines rev up, sergeant?
- Number-three engine's a little rough, sir.
The men are pretty tired.
We'll overhaul it in the morning.
- We're taking off in two hours.
- Sir?
I think you're gonna see that son of yours soon.
- Manila?
- Can you get that engine running?
We'll have her hitting home runs in 90 minutes.
Tell the crew they can sleep in the next world.
- We'll make it all right, sir.
- Good luck. Take off when you're ready.
By the way, tell your passenger
I'll have some papers for him.
- What passenger, sir?
- Hasn't he reported yet?
- Manila needs pilots. You're taking one.
- Who, sir?
Lieutenant Rader.
- Did you say Rader?
- Yes, and he's a good man too.
Three fighters got off the ground this morning, and he was one.
Knocked off four Jap Zeros before they shot him down.
He'll be recommended for a DFC.
Well, good luck again.
Thank you, sir.
Well...
...looks like you two fellas talked out of turn a while ago.
Maybe you better go and rustle up some grub for the crew.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Java, lieutenant?
- No, I've been living on it.
You fellas must have a plantation in Brazil.
I'll leave it here.
Maybe you'll want some later on.
- Is this here Wake Island?
- Yeah.
- How far is it?
- Oh, it's about 2300 miles from Honolulu.
- And we're gonna land on that dot?
- Yeah. It's not very big, is it?
Like trying to find a buckshot in Central Park.
Gee, I wish there were some traffic signs around.
- There are, but you can't see them.
- I mean like numbers and streets.
Yeah, but I call them latitudes and longitudes.
- And they're just like signs, huh?
- Yeah, if the wind doesn't change them.
Say, lieutenant, how we doing?
Now, look, you're the fifth guy that's been down here asking that.
- We'll hit Wake all right.
- Yes, sir.
I was just asking.
- Time to relieve the kid, Minnesota.
- Okay.
You want anything, lieutenant?
Yeah, I'd like to get out of this flying boxcar.
Sure a long way to Manila.
Mary-Ann ain't no boxcar, sir.
She's a good airplane.
- Mary-Ann?
- That's what we call her.
There ain't a better airplane in the Army.
- Maybe, if you're talking about bombers.
- Any airplane, sir.
- I'll take a pursuit ship for mine, sergeant.
- Well, you can take pursuit and...
Yes, sir.
Oh, chief, that's my last apple.
I'm saving it.
Don't leave it laying around, then.
There's a pursuit pilot back there.
Morning, sir. How we doing?
You too? Every 15 minutes, somebody wakes up and comes here to find out...
...if I know where we are or if I'm gonna get this airplane lost. I'm getting sick...
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sergeant.
- I guess I'm a little on edge.
- Oh, that's all right, sir.
That's the way your old man would've told me off.
Except he'd have done it with a four-star cussing.
- Yeah, I guess he would.
- Tell me, sir, how are we doing?
We're all right. I think we're gonna hit Wake right on the nose.
Sure we will, sir.
Say, chief, what happens if the Japs have took Wake Island before we get there?
I wish you'd learn to control that imagination of yours.
- I was just asking.
- Don't you know we're not at war?
- Ain't we in the war yet?
- Hasn't been declared.
- I don't get it.
- Them Japs.
They smear Pearl Harbor, smack Manila, raid Wake, Guam and Midway...
...and still there ain't no war.
They send a couple of oily gents to Washington...
...with a olive wreath for the president...
...while the boys back home slough
Uncle Sam over the head with a crowbar.
Your Uncle Sam is a pretty tough old gentleman.
You just wait till he gets mad.
I hope you don't mind if I get slightly annoyed in the meantime.
- No. But I didn't expect it of you.
- I still don't get it.
Message coming through, sir.
And good news.
Thanks, Peterson.
Hey, you guys, take a look at this.
That's wonderful.
If the head surgeon says that, she must be okay.
- Sure she is.
- Boy, I feel a lot better.
Oh, me too.
It was mighty swell of the CO to think of sending this.
Better show it to our passenger.
Poor guy must be worrying.
- Let him worry. He's got it coming.
- You're being a little tough with Rader.
- I haven't kicked him in the face yet.
- You couldn't be jealous, could you, Bill?
Well, maybe I am.
Peterson, ask Lieutenant Rader to come up front, will you?
That's the stuff.
Now, look, stay out of arguments.
- We never...
- You can't outtalk that guy.
He's been shooting off his face against big airplanes since they gave him wings.
But he doesn't know any better.
Just quit arguing.
- You'll be a lot better off.
- Okay, captain.
- Somebody up here wanna see me?
- Yeah.
- We got some good news for you, Tex.
- Yeah?
Boy, that is good news.
She's a swell kid.
You know, Tex, we were all pretty upset last night.
If we said anything out of line...
Oh, forget it, I know how you felt.
I don't blame you.
Thanks, Tex. After all, we've known each other a long time.
We've had our arguments about these big bombers and your Peashooters, but...
Forget it, Tommy.
Just a matter of opinion.
You know, Tex, we were wondering, what was it like yesterday at Hickam?
- Oh, an awful mess. We just weren't ready.
- How good are those Japs?
They're pretty good when they got the edge, 10 or 12 to one.
They don't like an even fight.
Every time you get one alone, he lights out like a scared sage hen.
- We heard you did a swell job.
- Thanks.
Hope you get a decoration.
I'd still like to know how all their carriers got away.
We didn't even get a bomber off.
- Caught them on the ground.
- You make it sound like the bombers' fault.
Okay, you two, quit it.
You guys are awful touchy about these crates.
- Oh, it's not that...
- Hold it.
- Go ahead, Monk.
- The wind shifted again.
Give me three degrees to the left.
You'd better make it 2.44.
Okay, two-four-four.
- That's the new flight control?
- You know the old type?
- Yeah.
- Well, this is a whole lot better.
Why don't you fly her and find out what a B-17 will do?
Oh, no, not me. Looks to me like she's flying herself anyway.
Well, she is right now, yeah.
She seems to be getting us there, not very fast though.
She'll out-fly your pursuit ships up high.
- Will she?
- Yeah, she will.
- You can't sell me.
- What'll a P-40 do at 30,000?
- We'd have to tow it to get it up there.
- We'd run away and hide on you.
- Well, that's all you could do.
- Oh, sure, no arguments.
If you guys will give me a chance,
I'll prove something.
- All right, go ahead.
- Three minutes and no interruptions.
- Anything to get this settled.
- Let him talk.
Irish, the navigator gave you a course.
You reach down and turn a knob and you're on it, right?
Tommy, that gadget there is almost as good as your bombsight, isn't it?
- Well, not quite...
- Well, almost.
- And you call the sight the brain, don't you?
- Yeah.
- Then this is a sort of mechanical brain too.
- It does everything but think.
It seems to be doing the thinking right now.
- Well, I don't...
- Watch out for him.
- Did you hear about it too?
- Hear what?
- I got it pretty straight.
- What?
Why, they're gonna give commissions to these mechanical brains in bombers.
Put them in uniform and teach them to talk, turn out bomber pilots on the assembly line.
We pursuit pilots will be upstairs fighting.
We'll look down and see a flock of these freight trains coming.
Press a button: "Lieutenant."
"Yes, sir?" says that thing.
"Drop a load of potatoes on the enemy."
"I'll tell Captain Bombsight right away."
"Very well. Where's your pilot?"
"We left him on the ground.
We don't need them.
Their heads take up too much room."
- Very funny.
- Did you ever think...?
- Keep them quiet, Irish.
- Shut up, you guys. Give him a chance.
Now, seriously, guys, these big crates are all right.
I just don't wanna fight in any airplane that more than one man can ride in.
I don't wanna be responsible for eight or 10 guys.
Or depending on them, the way you're on Hauser now.
What do you mean, depending on him?
In a pursuit ship, you're a one-man army, not a taxi driver.
You're on your own.
You don't wait for orders from a guy who can't fly, a bombardier.
Hey, that's enough.
You give orders to these taxi drivers when you go to lay eggs.
"Where to?" says the Irishman.
You say, "Go a few blocks and turn right.
Give me change for a nickel, conductor."
When you get to 33rd and Broadway, throw an egg out the window and run.
Very exciting. I wouldn't fly this crate if they made me a brigadier for it.
Bill, pipe down. Shut up, Rader.
Go ahead, Peterson.
I've picked up Washington on the short wave, sir.
- The president's on.
- Thanks.
Washington's on short wave.
Get below and grab some headphones.
Yeah, and take that pursuit pilot with you.
- Do I have to?
- Take him.
- Come on, lone eagle.
- Drop him out if you get a chance.
The attack yesterday...
... on the Hawaiian Islands...
... has caused severe damage
to American naval and military forces.
I regret to tell you that
very many American lives have been lost.
But always will our whole nation...
... remember the character
of the onslaught against us.
I hope he tells us something about the Philippines.
My boy's at Clark Field.
No matter how long it may take us...
... to overcome
this premeditated invasion...
... the American people,
in their righteous might...
... will win through to absolute victory.
We will not only defend ourselves
to the uttermost...
...but will make it very certain...
... that this form of treachery
shall never again endanger us.
With confidence in our armed forces...
... with the unbounding determination
of our people...
... we will gain the inevitable triumph...
... so help us God.
I ask that the Congress declare...
... a state of war.
Pick up anything from Wake Island?
- Pilot to navigator.
- Go ahead.
- What do you think, Monk?
- I don't know, Irish.
We ought to be there now.
Go another 10 minutes, then turn east.
Okay.
- There she is, Irish, dead ahead.
- Good guessing, Monk.
- Oh, shut up, will you?
- Magellan!
Pilot to crew. Wake Island, dead ahead.
- Hey, Wake Island in sight.
- Boy, what a navigator.
- There's nothing here but Marines.
- What'd you expect to see?
- Where'd you guys come from?
- Hickam Field.
- Any more coming?
- I don't know.
- Where are you going?
- Manila.
Gangway, men. Coming in.
Good work, captain.
Major Daniels, commanding.
Quincannon. Thank you, sir.
These are Lieutenants Williams,
McMartin and Rader.
And this is Lieutenant Hauser, our navigator.
We're gonna put him in a glass case in a museum.
- Did a good job, Hauser.
- The island looked pretty good to me, sir.
- Me too.
- Yes, I guess it did at that.
- Looks better than anytime since Monday.
- You mean Sunday, don't you?
Monday here was Sunday in Honolulu.
You've crossed the date line.
He's a pursuit pilot, major.
They don't get around very much.
Could we bunk down for five or six hours, sir?
We haven't had much sleep.
In six hours, you better be five and a half hours out.
With the beacons, Japs don't have to wait till daylight to call.
- My orders are to get you out in 20 minutes.
- Twenty minutes?
That's right.
- What do you say, sergeant?
- Well, we're halfway to Manila now, sir.
Don't see any reason we can't make it the rest of the way.
- Could use some help.
- Take all the men you need, sergeant.
All right.
You first five men come with me.
Get the cowling off number 3 engine.
Quincannon, our commander,
Major Bagley, wants to talk to you.
Yes, sir.
- So they really got the Arizona?
- Yes, sir.
Hickam Field was hit just as bad as Pearl Harbor.
A lot of fifth column work.
We got practically nothing off the ground, sir.
I've studied all the wars of history, gentlemen.
I've never come across any dirty treachery like that.
How many airplanes have you got, sir?
A week ago, we didn't have any.
A few days ago, they flew in 12 fighters from one of the carriers.
Eight were destroyed after they came in from patrol.
Only four left, sir?
Only two. And one of those can't fly.
But those four Grummans took on 60 Nips this afternoon.
Shot down plenty of them too.
Hogan and Ingersol got theirs.
I think you knew them.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I did.
I suppose the Japs will be back, major.
What are you gonna do then?
We got a lad catching a few winks of sleep that will take them all on single-handed.
- Lieutenant Rose.
- Bertie Rose?
- That's him.
- You guys remember Rose, don't you?
- Sure.
- Everybody kidded him about his size.
- Little bitty squirt about that high.
- Sure, we knew him.
I'd like to stand up and salute him.
Could we talk to him before we take off?
I'll tell him you wanted to see him.
He needs rest.
We have to roust him out any minute...
...and he hasn't had much of a chance to sleep lately.
- Ship's ready, sir.
- All right, sergeant.
And good luck to you.
It's been nice seeing you boys.
Go out and blast the Japs.
Teach them that treachery can't win no matter how much of a head start it has.
You young fellows will have to do that.
We're only fighting a delaying action here.
You can't hold out, sir?
I've got 400 Marines and they're fighting mad.
There's gonna be some Jap tail feathers flying around this island or I'm crazy.
Major Bagley, can't we fly you out, sir?
You and the rest of the wounded?
No, thanks, I'm fine here.
I'm not worth my weight in gasoline.
Me or anybody else.
They need that ship of yours in Manila.
Get it there.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, by the way...
...if you see my old boss,
General MacArthur...
...tell him, no matter what the news is...
...we'll be in here pitching till they strike us out.
All right, sir, we will.
- I'll see you all somewhere.
- So long.
- Best of luck to you.
- Thanks.
- You think we ought to take him with us?
- He wouldn't leave this island...
...if you got him a lower berth in a Pullman.
- There you go.
- One for the wife, one for the kid.
He'll be old enough to read by the time I get back.
- Don't lose them, soldier.
- Don't worry.
I was gonna leave a letter here for the Clipper.
She got away yesterday.
Twenty-six bullet holes in her.
- Crew so mad they wanted to stay and fight.
- The old man got tough with them.
- Take care of this one.
- This one too.
Come on.
We don't want Tripoli to get hurt.
- Gave him the rank of top sergeant.
- No pedigree, but he sure can fight.
- He'd tackle a Jap three times his size.
- Anything.
No, I wish I could, but I'd get in an awful jam.
Give him to the Marines in Manila.
We gotta get him out of here.
- Come on, soldier.
- It's against regulations, pal.
- I can't take that dog onboard with me.
- You can.
- Wanna get me busted?
- You're not...
He's trained too. Look.
Tripoli, do you like Mr. Moto?
- See?
- Ain't that cute, Winocki?
- He's smart.
- What do you say, Brooklyn?
- Come on, soldier.
- Give him a kiss.
Gee, I'd like to, honest, but...
Gee, here goes my promotion.
- That's a good fellow.
- Duck. Here they come.
- Well, goodbye, sir. And luck.
- Same to you, boys.
- Anything we can do for you in Manila?
- You might send us more Japs.
- We'll try to.
- So long.
- Good luck, men.
- Good luck, sir.
Bye, sir.
What's the matter, Bill, can't you sleep?
No, I keep thinking of those marines back there on Wake.
- They haven't got a prayer, Irish.
- No, I know they haven't.
But they're gonna have some fun before anybody gets on that island.
Yeah.
How are things, sergeant?
Oh, I'm kind of...
What the...?
Why, it's a dog.
Who belongs to this?
Look at that. Is that your dog, chief?
It ain't my dog. What kind of a crew chief do you think I am?
- I was just asking.
- Who brought him onboard?
- Well, maybe he just walked on.
- And tied himself in a sack?
- Come on, who did it?
- I didn't.
You, Weinberg?
- Maybe the Marines done it.
- Sure.
- If I'm not mistaken, they had a dog.
- His name was Rover.
- No, his name was Tripoli.
- Talk fast.
- He had a cute trick.
- What?
Let's see if this is him. Look here, Tripoli.
What do you think of this Mr. Moto?
Moto. There you are. It's the same dog.
I know the dog came from Wake Island and I know you brought him onboard.
- Me?
- You can get busted for this.
Why don't you ask me, sergeant?
- I did it.
- You?
- Yeah, me. Shut up.
- Listen, Joe.
You ought to know better than do a trick like that.
- Why?
- Because it's against regulations.
Makes no difference. Regulations...
You know why this dog is here.
We know what chance those Marines have on that island, so they gave us this dog.
Go on up front and report me.
I've been busted out.
- Now, Joe, I did it. I don't...
- Shut up. I'm getting sore.
We got chased out before we can even light...
...got kicked all over the place by sneaking Nips...
...and you're yapping about regulations.
- You're changing your tune, ain't you?
- So, what if I am?
- I'd like to do a little chasing myself.
- Me too.
- Go on, tell them.
- I'm a half a mind to...
- I'd like to...
- Come here. Come here.
- Come here.
- Why'd you wanna do that for?
Pipe down.
Hey, look what's here.
What is this, sergeant? Noah's Ark?
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Who brought him on this airplane?
- He could have jumped on.
- Or flown in the window...
...but he didn't.
- No, sir.
- You know it's against regulations.
- Yes, sir.
And you don't know who did it?
You didn't see anybody do it?
No, sir, I didn't.
We can't very well throw him out now, can we?
- We could take care of him, sir.
- We can?
- Yes, sir.
- Who back there likes dogs, sergeant?
Why, I think Winocki and Weinberg like dogs.
- You think they'd like to take care of him?
- Yes, sir. I think they would.
- All right, sergeant, you tell them.
- Yes, sir. I'll tell them.
It'll be pretty tough on you if we gotta fly over that stuff ahead.
We can fix that.
He's a cute little pooch.
- What's his name?
- I think they call him "Tripoli."
- Tripoli?
- Yes. He don't like Japs.
Tripoli, what do you think of that guy Moto?
So you don't like Moto, huh?
Well, what is this, a flying doghouse?
Look out.
He doesn't like pursuit pilots.
- What's his name?
- Moto.
Hi, Moto.
- Didn't we tell you?
- That dog's a judge of character.
Here, Moto. Be nice, Moto.
Hello, Moto.
He doesn't like me.
I'm getting out of here.
Tripoli, you're gonna be very useful around here.
- Take good care of him, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Well, did you tell him how the pup got aboard?
- No.
- You didn't?
But I'm telling you to take care of him.
If he don't behave himself, you can take care of that too.
Pilot to crew.
We're going up to 20,000.
Better check your oxygen.
There you are, Tripoli.
He seems to like it all right.
He ain't putting up no kick.
Just like a baby on a bottle.
05564 to Clark Field.
- Here they are, sir.
- 05564 to Clark.
Clark Field to 05564.
What's your position? Go ahead.
We're about four miles northeast of the field.
Two thousand.
What are your landing instructions?
We've only got one runway.
North to south.
It's pretty rough.
The Japs just had a picnic.
Someday we're gonna find a field that's flat.
Hold him off a while.
Those tractors are still working out there.
Do not land. Keep your altitude.
Do not land.
Sorry, have to come straight in.
Running out of fuel.
Sergeant, get those tractors off that runway.
- Tell him to come in low over the fence.
- Come in low over the fence. South end.
Cut close to the wire, you haven't much room.
Tractors working down the middle of the runway.
We've got the fence with us.
- Take a look, Robby.
- Yes, sir.
- Hi there, Irish.
- Hi, major.
Say, when we were at Kelly Field, didn't I teach you how to get over a fence?
That's one way to stop quick.
I just cut her too fine.
Not bad, anyway.
After 7000 consecutive miles...
...you did a great job, all of you.
- Hi there, Rader.
- Hi you, sir.
- Don't tell me you've joined the bombers.
- No, I still belong to the opposition.
He doesn't appreciate a good airplane, major.
It ain't that.
It's just that I don't like them big.
- Tail wheel clear, sir. No damage.
- Okay.
Take her down the end and get her a full load of gas...
...drop your extra tanks and get ready for action, Irish.
- Okay, major.
- The Japs been hitting us...
...with 60 bombers at a clip.
You gotta be ready to take off at any time.
You can see yourself, you're wide open on the ground.
Colonel Blake wants to see you.
I'll pick you up in a while.
All right, sir.
Hold it.
You got any sectional maps for around here?
- Yeah, but I haven't got enough.
- Grab as many as you can get.
Find out what size bombs they'll give us and load them.
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.
- Thanks for the buggy ride, Irish.
- Okay, Tex.
- Weinberg, open the bomb bay.
- Right.
Peterson, check your radio.
You and Chester, give him a hand with the loading.
Winocki, find the line chief and see if they'll give you a transfer.
We'll get somebody to replace you.
All right, get going.
- Okay.
- Winocki.
You wanna get out of this crew?
- That's what you want me to do?
- Not necessarily.
You'd take that stuff
I've been handing you?
- We all make mistakes.
- I'm beginning to realize that myself. I...
Turn that dog over to the nearest Marine and get back and check those guns.
- Give them a good going over.
- Yes, sir.
Be ready as quick as you can, sergeant.
- Okay, Bill, let's go.
- Oh, captain.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you see if you could find out something about my boy?
Sure, I will, sergeant.
- Hey, buddy, any Marines around here?
- If so, the place would be in better shape.
- You a Marine?
- What's it to you?
- You're one all right. Got this for you.
- What's this?
You outfit on Wake gave it to us to deliver.
His name is Tripoli. Feed him good.
- He'll eat like a company commander.
- What's your name?
Callahan. Thanks.
- You all ready up there?
- All ready.
Let it go. Watch her, boys.
Steady. Keep her level.
Now turn her, fellows.
Turn her.
Hurry it up, boys. Make it snappy.
That's about it.
Take the strain off.
Take it away.
That's the situation as it stands right now.
- I've given the facts to you straight.
- Yes, sir.
We've taken a licking because we were caught on the ground.
Since then, they've outnumbered us 10-to-1.
Yet every time we've been up against them, they've lost five to our one.
In other words, if we were anywhere near equal, we could lick them.
The record proves it.
From now on, our job's to keep fighting with what we've got...
...till we get enough airplanes to blast them off the earth.
How long since you had any sleep, captain?
- We haven't had much time.
- When did you leave the mainland?
- Saturday night.
- Three days and three nights flying.
You've done a good job.
- I've got a good crew, sir.
- Yeah, I can believe it.
- Excuse me, sir.
- What'd you find, Moran?
That PT boat was right.
Looks like an invasion fleet.
- What's in it?
- There's a transport and a tanker.
- Got a battleship or cruiser and destroyers.
- Where?
Forty miles off Lingayen last time I saw them.
I didn't have much time to stick around.
Sky suddenly got full of Zeros.
So I headed for home.
I marked their position and course on this chart.
Right here. A flight of Boeing B-17s could give them a nice party, sir.
- We haven't got a flight of B-17s.
- You've got one, sir, loading up now.
- You wanna tackle it?
- Yes, sir.
All right, study this first.
Take your time, don't take any chances.
Moran will give you the dope and good luck.
Excuse me, sir. There's one thing more.
I told our crew chief I'd find out about his son, Lt. White.
Danny White. Can you tell me anything about him, sir?
Yeah, I can. He was killed the first day.
That's a shame.
Give these to old Robbie, will you?
I've known him for a long time.
How did it happen, sir?
Capt. Anderson in the other office can tell you more than I can.
He saw the whole thing happen.
Yes, sir.
Did you find out anything, sir?
How'd it happen?
He was trying to take his flight off during the first raid.
Before he could get off...
...they hit the runway right in front of him with a big one.
Didn't even get into the air.
It's not much to show for 20 years, is it, sir?
Get that airplane off the ground.
- All right, sergeant, let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Pull that dolly out.
- Close the bomb bay.
- How many loaded?
- Three, sir. All big ones.
- Thousand pounders?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
Come on, let's get this thing out of here.
Take it away.
Doors are closed. Everything all set, sir.
Wheels up.
- Wheels up.
- Monk?
- Go ahead.
- What do you make it?
Three-thirty-one, Irish.
Okay, 331.
- You better put on your chute, Robbie.
- Yes, sir.
Navigator to pilot.
- Go ahead.
- We're about 30 miles off the coast.
You better go down
and take a look.
Okay. Going down.
Fighters.
Pilot to crew.
There's a flock of Zeros ahead.
Two o'clock at about 3000 feet above us.
There's another bunch at 10 o'clock.
Take your time.
Sing out if they get on our tail
and I'll kick her around.
Make it count.
We've got a lot to get even for.
Here they come.
Coming over.
Did you see that?
They break up in little pieces.
Winocki, one at 9 o'clock even.
Coming down.
Coming over.
Great.
Kick it left.
Take it to the right.
Hey, Joe. Fried Jap going down.
Gas line on two.
Gas line on two.
- Oil line's burning.
- Yeah.
It looks like we'll have to bail out.
Pilot to crew.
Are you hurt, Irish?
Yeah.
Pilot to crew. Abandon ship.
All right, come on, kids.
Tommy, get rid of your sight. You and Monk go out through the bomb bay.
- I know...
- I'll use the escape hatch.
- But you're hurt.
- Go on.
They'll have to drag the bottom of the ocean to get this.
- Open the escape hatch. I'll throw it out.
- Right.
- Irish, you...
- Go on, get out.
You're about 15 or 20 miles northwest of the field. Get out.
Yes, sir. Go ahead, Peterson.
- Weinberg.
- I don't think I'm gonna like this.
Go on.
All right, kid.
- Winocki.
- Go ahead, I'm coming.
Okay.
05564 to Clark Field.
Emergency landing. Emergency landing.
- There she is, sir. One engine's burning.
- Get your wheels down.
I can't do it. Gear's jammed.
It won't come down.
- Well, Joe?
- I just had a look at that B-17, sir.
What about her?
I counted over a hundred bullet holes in her.
Two motors hit, props are bent, controls in a mess, wheels damaged...
...fuel tanks are punctured, one wing's gone.
At least the tip.
- I don't see how they brought her down.
- Neither do I.
I suppose if we had 10 days and plenty of spare parts...
...we might make her fly again.
I don't know that we'll have 24 hours.
- We'll have to write off the Mary Ann.
- All right, we'll destroy her.
No use lighting any fires tonight.
They'd only hit us again.
Joe, send out a demolition squad in the morning.
- All right, sir.
- So long.
- What about the crew?
- They all got back all right, sir.
- Where are they now?
- Over at the hospital.
- Quincannon asked to see them.
- How's he?
That's too bad.
Yeah.
It's good to see you.
What are you...?
What are you doing with that rifle, Tex?
Picked up too many slugs in the P-39, Irish.
I'm a foot soldier now.
They finally got him where he belongs.
Anyway, we was using up
Japs so fast...
...they was afraid there wouldn't be none left to surrender.
- Winocki?
- Yes, sir.
- They told me you brought her in.
- He did, sir.
She came in herself. I just sat there.
It was a good job.
She's all right, huh?
She's all right, isn't she?
- Robbie.
- Yes, sir?
- She's all right, she'll fly again?
- Sure she will, skipper.
What's wrong with her?
- She's gonna be all right.
- Tell me.
- Props, gear, wing tip.
- Just a tip?
It's a wing tip, sir.
Couple of days...
- Two days?
- Two days. Yes, sir.
But she will fly again?
- Yeah.
- That's fine.
Get as many men as you need, Robbie.
The colonel will give them to you.
I'll get a clearance.
We'll leave right away.
- We gotta hurry.
- Nurse.
Easy, easy, Irish.
- Get the doctor right away.
- Oh, no. No, the doctor can't go.
Regulations.
Besides, we already got one passenger.
Is he here, that pursuit pilot?
- Here, sir.
- Okay, start them, Bill.
Sure, Irish.
Everybody in, chief?
All in, sir.
- Doors closed?
- Yes, sir.
Here we go.
- Lock them.
- Locked.
Wheels up.
- Coming up.
- They sound like they're gonna run all right.
- Robbie?
- Yes, sir.
- Pilot to navigator.
- Go ahead.
Monk.
- Monk, what's our course?
- Due east, skipper.
That's right into the sunrise.
- Right into the sunrise.
- Over here, major.
That's all, boys.
Well, let's get going, fellas.
We got a lot to do.
- Corporal?
- There's something wrong.
- Yeah? What?
- I don't know.
But there's something wrong.
- What are you talking about?
- We was to burn them airplanes.
- Well, did you?
- No, not all of them, sir.
- Why not?
- They're being stolen.
- What?
- Japs are stealing it.
Don't talk nonsense, man.
There have been Japanese through but they're snipers.
- They're not stealing.
- But...
Now, wait a minute, Mallory.
Let's get this straight.
- You had five B-17s to demolish.
- Yes, sir.
- What is it you wanna tell us?
- They're missing.
- You mean parts of them?
- Sure. I mean, yes, sir.
- Why on earth would anybody...?
- Now, look.
There's a B-17, the one that came in yesterday.
- The Mary Ann.
- Have you burned it?
- No, sir.
- Why not?
We was, but I told the boys
I ought to report them Japs.
Well, you've reported.
You better burn it.
Yes, sir.
What was he talking about?
I don't know, sir, but I'd better go out and have a look.
I'll go with you.
There's the stuff we've been missing.
- How's it coming, chief?
- All right.
- All right, Weinberg, lower away.
- Okay.
- Hey, sarge, your guns loaded?
- Sure they are. Keep a coming.
- Any bombs in?
- No, not yet. Come on.
- Get down, sarge.
- Get away from here.
- Get down. We're gonna burn this junk.
- What?
A couple of you get in there and get the live ammunition out.
Hey, wait a minute.
You said you gonna burn this plane?
The colonel said to burn it so she's gonna.
Get your stuff out.
Okay, boys. Bring in the gas.
Wait a minute.
Get this gasoline away from that airplane.
- Hey, Butch.
- Weinberg.
I thought you still was on a streetcar in Jersey.
- I wished I was.
- Lieutenant Williams.
- You ain't gonna burn that airplane?
- I got orders.
- I never enlisted to be no fireman.
- Go on.
If you know this firebug, get him out of here before he gets hurt.
I don't wanna, but orders is orders.
- What orders?
- To burn the plane.
- Who gave them to you?
- The CO.
Yeah? Well, you tell that CO to take a...
Take a look at this airplane.
- I am.
- Sorry, I didn't see you.
- Apparently not.
- There's no reason to burn this airplane.
- She's gonna be good as new.
- We're gonna rig a tail gun.
- Been working all night.
- She'll fly when we get through.
- We'll have her in the air in 24 hours.
- We won't have this field.
- I know, but...
- Now, look.
I appreciate what you're trying to do.
But our job's to destroy everything that'll be of use to those Japs.
Excuse me, but we can't move any gas.
- The trucks have all been wrecked.
- Scare up drums. Get it here.
- You can't get that ready in time to...
- We can.
- The bomb sight still in this airplane?
- Yes, sir. The one we "borrowed."
- We won't let...
- Give us a chance.
- I'd like to, but...
- Excuse me, sir.
I've been in this Army 20 years.
I've never asked a favor.
- We'll get her out. I give you my word.
- We'll burn her ourselves if we can't.
You're crazy. You know what'll happen if the Japs move in?
- We do, sir.
- All the rest?
- Yes, sir.
- You'll burn her?
Yes, sir.
All right. It's your funeral.
Forget it, corporal.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Come on, boys. Let's...
- Excuse me, sir.
That observation plane is patched up and ready to go.
But I'm gonna need a gunner.
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?
I'll need one of your gunners.
Which one can you spare?
- Well...
- I can go.
- Wait a minute.
- He shouldn't go.
- He's more useful here.
- He's right, sir.
- All right. Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.
- That kid's awfully green, lieutenant.
- I know.
- Come on, give us a hand.
- Okay.
Don't like him leaving Mary Ann this way. Ain't good luck.
Be back in a couple of hours.
Swing it wide.
- Put some muscle into it.
- Will I!
Where'd you find that little beast, sergeant?
Beast?
He's a Marine Corps dog, lieutenant.
Yeah, I know. Hiya, Moto.
Hey, Moto, cut it out.
Cut it out.
Get him away, sergeant.
I've had enough trouble with Jap snipers without getting hydrophobia.
- His name ain't Moto, it's Tripoli.
- What?
Yeah, Tripoli. Maybe he don't like to be called Moto.
That's it. Cute trick, ain't it?
Yeah, very cute.
- How's it going, Rader?
- Not good. They're withdrawing to Bataan.
All I could get was a foxhole view with my face in six inches of dirt.
I thought if I came back
I could get an airplane.
You've got a fat chance for that.
We got one 0-47 left.
We might get you to Batavia or Port Darwin.
- They've got airplanes.
- We're getting out too.
- How about that B-17 I came in with?
- What? That crazy outfit?
They're working on it.
They've been up all night.
- Robbing the other wrecks for spare parts.
- Haven't got a chance getting it to fly.
- Forget it.
- But can I help them?
What kind of lunatics have we got in this Air Corps?
- Don't you know what's impossible?
- Thank you, sir.
- Hey.
- Excuse me, colonel.
- What?
- Can't I lend a hand too?
- You can go straight to...
- Help, sir? Thank you, sir.
Come on, stay with me. Come on.
- Hello, Weinberg.
- Gee, it's the pursuit pilot.
- We thought you was in the infantry.
- It's too hard on the feet.
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi, Tex.
- Things get too tough for you?
- I came to see if I could give you a hand.
How you making out with Moto there?
I'm getting along fine, Tommy, with Tripoli.
- I knew it all along, you morons.
- Sure, sure.
Looks like you guys got yourself a job.
- How about me and the Marine Corps?
- Listen to who's talking.
You asking to join this crew?
I'd rather fly than walk.
Even in this crate.
- Changed your mind, haven't you?
- No, but I'm willing to work my way.
Stop grinning and tell me what to do.
- Are you serious?
- Why, sure.
What we need is gas. I don't know how you're gonna get it, but get it.
Take the Marine with you so you can find your way back.
Okay, Callahan.
- Watch it now. Watch it.
- Pick up. Pick up the end.
All right. That's got her. Now, give me that.
Where's Weinberg?
- Left for oil. He'll be back.
- Okay.
Hey, those are Jap planes.
Get going, men.
Get on the guns.
Bring some more ammunition.
Good work, Robbie.
- Don't talk. Shoot.
- There's another one for you.
You dog!
Look, they're after the kid.
- They're gonna get him on the way down.
- Look out, kid.
Stay here, Weinberg.
Dirty...
I guess we'd better get him back now.
Yeah.
All right, now, boys, get on this lift.
Come on now.
Let's go. All together. Come on, heave.
- Well, there she is, sir.
- Think there's room in there to work a gun?
I'll show you.
Hand me the gun when I get in.
Okay.
It looks like it'll work all right.
The Japs are gonna get a surprise when they come on the tail of this B-17.
What about the tail wheel?
- I can get through if you leave it down.
- Okay.
Got a full bomb load?
To the gills. Don't know what we're gonna do with them.
Well, we can always drop them out.
- Hey, lieutenant?
- Yeah?
- Hand me a can of ammunition, will you?
- Coming up.
- Lieutenant, give us a hand here.
- Sure, let's go.
- Pull it in again. Here we go.
- How's that?
That's got her.
Now, get a couple of planks across here, will you?
- Sounds like they're getting closer.
- We'll have to be out by daylight.
- We will.
- It's almost 5 now.
Weinberg just finished Number 3.
Yeah, but if Rader doesn't get back with that gasoline soon we might as well...
- Who is it?
- Me, sir, Peterson and Callahan.
We got your gas, plenty.
- A whole truckload.
- Good.
- How we gonna get it out?
- Cans and buckets.
- Rader's bringing a bunch of soldiers.
- Here they are now.
- Where do you want it?
- Right where it is.
- Okay, men, let's get these drums out.
- Come on, snap into it.
Some of you get around behind.
Get around behind.
Good work, boys. Keep them going.
Step on it. Don't slop it.
Handle those cans careful.
Don't slop it around the plane.
Keep them level, keep them level.
Come on up here.
Okay, sarge. Number 4 will run.
- Fitter, get the cowling on.
- It's going on.
- Lieutenant, lieutenant.
- Yeah?
- Engines are ready.
- Good work. Thanks, kid.
- It's getting too close.
- Come on. Hurry it up.
- Don't spill it, don't spill it.
- Faster, men, with these buckets.
- Lieutenant Williams?
- Right here.
- They're coming. Through there.
- That'll have to be enough.
- Get everything clear to take her off.
- Yes. Hold that gas.
- Hold that gas.
- Drop those pails.
Give us a hand moving that shaft.
Come on. Get this stuff out of here.
Some get around to the front wheels.
Start her up as soon as we're turned around.
- Winocki, get on the guns.
- Come on, Peterson.
Try and hold them off.
Get in, in the bomb sight.
Monk. You and Callahan, siphon this gasoline.
If it won't start, we'll burn her.
Come on, get on this tail.
Come on now, shove her.
Straight back. Shove her.
- Hey!
- Hold it there!
That's all right.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Keep going.
Okay.
Weinberg, get inside to help Rader.
Okay, that's far enough. Turn her around.
That's enough. Hold it.
Now, take her around. Come on.
Hard, now. Push. Everybody.
Come on. Take her around.
That's enough. That's enough.
That's far enough.
All right, soldiers.
Get going, soldiers. Run.
Keep clear of the props.
All clear. Start it, lieutenant.
Okay, stay clear.
- Get everybody out.
- Lieutenant.
But we've got to. Go on.
All right, bring over that gasoline.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't burn it.
Hold it, hold it, hold it!
Get out of there. Get out.
Keep clear. Get away.
Go ahead, Tex.
Give it to her.
- Wheels up.
- Coming up.
That's all right, sir.
It's this one here, Robbie.
That's easy.
How are we doing, sir?
For a plane they said would never fly again, we're fine.
- How's our fuel consumption?
- Nothing to worry about.
We'll make Australia all right.
- Peterson picked up news on the radio.
- What's that?
There's a Jap invasion fleet headed for Australia.
That's what they think.
Our Pacific fleet's hunting for them.
I wish them luck.
You know, Tex...
...you're a funny-looking thing to be flying a B-17.
Yeah? I hope they got P-40s in Darwin.
If they haven't, I'm gonna take up knitting.
I think he's the guy that shot me in the arm just so he could get in that seat.
Don't do me an injustice, Bill.
I'd only shoot you to get out this seat.
Why don't you fellas sleep while you can?
We kind of got out of the habit.
How about it, Joe?
Is that tail gun of yours gonna work?
Just wait and see.
Hey, sergeant, we gonna stop at Mindanao?
- No, we've already passed there.
- Yeah?
You look like you know how to work that gun, Callahan.
What do you think a Marine uses, a bow and arrow?
I wouldn't put it past them.
Navigator to pilot.
Take a look down below.
On the left, right under us.
- Holy smoke.
- Boy, look at that.
Looks like we hit the jackpot.
- Here we go again.
- Start shooting.
- Those are Japs.
- What'll we do?
- Pull up through the clouds.
- Going up.
Where we going?
Give me a crack at them.
Hold your horses. Get below.
We're gonna start a war, not a fight.
Four degrees north, 124 degrees east.
Okay. Pilot to radio.
Did you hear that, Peterson?
Write it down.
Four north, 124 east. Got it?
Four north, 124 east.
Contact all air bases in this area.
Army, Navy, carriers, everyone you can reach.
Tell them we sighted a big Jap task force headed south.
- Give them that position.
- Yes, sir.
We're gonna play hide-and-seek
until they get here.
- Radio to pilot.
- Go ahead, Peterson.
Army bombers and Navy torpedo planes have reached the approximate position.
Their formation leader's calling you
on the command set.
Okay.
Williams in 05564 talking. Go ahead.
Hello, Bill. This is Jack Harper.
We're looking for you. Where are you?
Hiya, Jack. We're at 14,000.
There they are.
Where are those Japs you're worrying about, Bill?
We're roosting right over them.
Just make a turn and follow us.
Turning now.
Pilot to crew. Get ready, fellas.
This ought to be fun.
- Let's go calling, Tex.
- Yeah, man.
Now you're gonna see what an Air Force can do.
- How do you want it?
- The cruiser third from the right.
Take her in line,
I'll pour them down their funnels.
- Don't waste any eggs, Popeye.
- You watch the basket, I'll lay the eggs.
Bomb bay doors opening.
Hold it.
- Ready to bomb.
- Hold it.
Slide right.
Left a little.
To the left.
Steady.
Bombs away.
Here they come. Weinberg to pilot.
About nine Japs a little above us, around 4 o'clock.
Wait for them and make them count.
Monk, coming down, straight ahead.
- Did you get hit?
- Sure, I got hit.
- Do you need some...?
- Watch out.
- Did you see that?
- What do you want, a cigar?
They're coming in on our tail.
Wait for them. They don't know we got a stinger in our tail.
- Which one now, Tommy?
- Let's take that carrier straight ahead.
Okay.
- What do you think of our bomber now?
- Boy, I'll take it for mine.
We gotta get out of here.
We just lost half our gas.
Attention.
All right, men. At ease.
Turn that thing off, Henson.
Well, gentlemen...
...this is it.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Tonight, your target is Tokyo.
You're gonna play them the "Star
Spangled Banner" with two-ton bombs.
You've got to remember what you've learned...
...and follow your squadron leaders.
They'll get you in and they'll get you out too.
Williams, you lead the first section.
Rader, the second.
Hauser will navigate for the entire squadron...
...and McMartin will talk to you bombardiers before taking off.
Any questions?
All right, that's all.
Good luck to you and give them hell.
We shall carry the attack
against the enemy.
We shall hit him and hit him again...
... wherever and whenever
we can reach him.
For we intend to bring
this battle to him...
... on his own home grounds.
You are looking at Superstition Mountain.
A barbaric pile of rock,
40 miles long by 20 wide.
The man is Floyd Buckley.
He's going into this 800 square miles of sudden and violent death... because he thinks it's just another mountain... and because he's greedy for its treasure.
Yeah, I said treasure. Gold.
$20 million worth of precious yellow metal... waiting to be found in America's most elusive mine... appropriately named "The Lost Dutchman".
It's simple to get to. The mountain, I mean.
Just drive 36 miles due east from Phoenix, Arizona, and there she is.
She looks easy from the outside.
Inside, it's like Satan's private art gallery.
Sculptured pagan granites, unmellowed by time... hidden in terrifying canyons and gorges.
But if you'd like to pick up $20 million... and figure, like Buckley there, that a mountain's just a mountain...
I'll show you where to look.
But before you leave for Arizona... you ought to know that 21 men have been murdered grabbing for that dough... and hundreds more have died in other ways.
You see, this is the true story of Superstition Mountain.
The biography of a death trap.
My name's Barry Storm.
I was hurled into this story when I heard that shot.
Up till then, I was just an ordinary guy with a reasonable curiosity... about the Lost Dutchman Mine.
A curiosity I wish I'd never been born with.
I hurried towards the sound of the report... and hoped I'd find a hunter who'd maybe bagged a deer.
I found Floyd Buckley, sprawled and dead.
His blood, life, and dreams spilling out on the unfriendly ground.
When you find a dead man, you're supposed to call the police.
I'm a good citizen.
I set out to do what you're supposed to do.
Fear and panic gave me a boost up over that ledge... and I began to run, not walk, to the nearest exit.
Speed no longer meant anything to Buckley, but it did to me.
I didn't want to be framed in the crosshairs of a telescopic sight... on a high-powered rifle.
I'd just gone in to look for gold.
I didn't want to find lead from the business end of a killer's gun.
It took me three days and 36 miles of tough hiking... to put the sheriff from Florence, Arizona into action.
Identification bracelet.
Wallet.
Telegram.
"Lecturing in Los Angeles, September 30th."
They're going to have to get a new speaker.
That's all the personal effects.
Let's go.
Sit down, son.
You say your name's Barry Storm.
You're from Colorado and you've been here only 10 days.
You're no prospector, but you were up there when Buckley got shot.
What were you doing in the mountain?
I know it sounds kind of bad, but I was following Buckley.
You were what?
Now, wait a minute. I didn't shoot him.
I had a good reason to be up there.
My grandfather was Jacob Walz.
- Who?
- Jacob Walz.
The man who owned the Lost Dutchman Gold Mine.
The Dutchman, huh?
That goes back to about 1880.
He's supposed to have killed quite a few men in his time.
That doesn't have anything to do with me.
All I know is, when I was a kid... my mum heard about this mine her father was supposed to have found.
I always figured someday I'd come down here.
So you came down here. Go on.
I thought there might still be a buck laying around that had my name on it.
The first place I went to was the Claims Office in Phoenix.
- How do you spell that again?
- Walz. W-A-L-Z. Jacob Walz.
Nope. Nobody by that name ever registered a claim here.
This record goes clear back to 1870.
But there must have been.
The Lost Dutchman was supposed to be worth a fortune.
He wouldn't leave the money laying around.
Maybe he never found a mine.
Some people don't believe there ever was a Lost Dutchman.
Well, then again, some do.
The news had a story on it just this morning.
There.
This newspaper item was my first lead.
I wanted to meet this guy who said he was going to find my grandfather's mine.
Mr. Buckley, ask you a couple of questions about this newspaper story.
- Certainly. I'm always glad to see the press.
- I'm not a reporter.
I'm just interested in you being so sure about locating that Lost Dutchman.
If you read my books, you'd know
I wouldn't go on a wild-goose chase.
- You've got a map?
- Naturally I have a map.
- One of the original Peraltas, in fact.
- Peralta?
The Peralta mine I'm seeking and the Lost Dutchman are one and the same.
Then it looks like you and I have got something in common.
- Yes?
- I happen to be Jacob Walz's grandson.
Really? You mean the man who allegedly owned it?
That's very interesting, I'm sure.
- I never knew he left a family.
- I can prove it if I have to.
That's why it might be good business to let me come along with you.
If you know how to use this map...
I not only know how to use it, but I know where the marker is.
And I know how to use that, too.
But for your information, young man,
I never go partners.
Excuse me.
He really brushed me off.
I decided right then to follow him.
When his car dropped him off at Apache Junction, I was waiting.
I started tailing him then.
But Buckley was too sharp.
He lost me on the third day.
I never caught up with him again.
- Not till after I heard the shots.
- 30-30. Entered downward, from behind.
This must be the map he was talking about. It was in his wallet.
- Something's been torn off the top of it.
- Maybe that's the way he got it.
Maybe it had directions on it and he tore it off himself.
Some fellows memorize directions so that nobody else can use their maps.
Why, half the state has got indigestion from eating old maps.
You been staying in Phoenix?
- Your things there?
- Well, some of them.
Most everything I own is right on me.
I put my bag in the bus depot after I checked out of the hotel.
You haven't got a job.
You say you're the Dutchman's grandson.
You tail a guy you thought was holding out on you. He gets knocked off.
Ray, you'd better take him out to the mountain tomorrow.
Let him show you just how he spent those three days.
Walter, you'd better go along with them.
How long after the shot before you found him?
Ten to fifteen minutes.
Maybe longer. He was still warm.
- You didn't see anybody else?
- No.
What were your plans if Buckley had found the mine?
Well, I don't know exactly.
But I wouldn't have shot him.
Well, I guess I didn't have any plans.
That is, beyond hoping there might be a mine I might have some legal rights to.
Come on, Walter.
Let's have a look at the other side of the canyon.
What are you looking for now?
Buckley was hit from behind.
The killer was somewhere up there by that cliff.
You were up over there.
Does that take me off the hook?
Maybe. Unless Buckley spun around before he fell.
You see, three other guys have been knocked off in this same area... ahead of Buckley, before you even got here.
That's a break in your favour.
Buckley was the fourth?
The fourth in the last two years.
All right around here and all by a 30-30.
And if you look in the record book... you'll find out 20 men have died in this mountain since 1880.
Well, I'm through. Let's get back to Apache Junction and some cold beer.
I was just thinking, this all adds up to something.
- Like what?
- Four guys murdered, all in the same area... all by a 30-30, all in the shadow of Weaver's Needle.
So?
The killer thinks he knows where the gold is.
When it looked like the others might find it before he did... when they got too close, he knocked them off.
So the jackpot must be somewhere close.
Near that peak.
Buckley, I bet he found it.
- Found what? The mine?
- No, the marker.
He said he knew where the marker was and how to use it.
Come on. I'll show you something.
There's your marker.
- This is what Buckley meant?
- It's the only marker in this mountain.
The rocks hammered in that old saguaro cactus indicate three directions... but only the one pointing north leads anywhere, though... to some signs carved in those rocks up there.
It's quite a climb. Come on.
There they are.
What do they mean?
Oro is the word for gold.
The sunburst means the mine is near.
Now, this means 50 yards away in the direction the snake is pointing.
Now, the only trouble is, nobody has ever been able to find anything... by following those signs.
- Aren't they the real thing?
- Who knows?
Who put them there?
You suppose my grandfather?
No, they're Spanish signs.
Supposed to have been cut by the Peraltas.
Peraltas. Buckley had a Peralta map.
- Had the name "Manuel" on it.
- There were three of them.
Brothers. Manuel, Pedro, and Ramon.
They were the first to find gold in here
100 years ago.
There's an old Indian legend about them and this mountain, eh, Walter?
They opened up several of the mines and then left.
And then Pedro, the oldest brother, came back with a big expedition.
Walter, here, who's an Apache himself, has heard from his own people... the story of what happened.
After many nuisance raids by the Indians...
Pedro Peralta decided to hide his gold.
He selected the richest and most inaccessible mine of all... as his storage place.
It was reached through a narrow, twisted, and almost hidden canyon... that finally opened onto a torturous runway.
This runway was the only entrance to and the only exit from... the fabulous mine, located on the thin precipitous ledge below.
While armed men stood guard...
Pedro's miners led their animals to the dangerous ledge... where the rough ore was separated from that which had been crushed... and the pure gold nuggets were hurriedly poured into sacks... for storage in the hidden mine.
Pedro sat just inside his mine... and noted that he possessed some $20 million worth of gold.
But fate had decreed a different kind of fortune for him.
Fate, and the Apaches.
Cochise, the greatest of all Apache chiefs... watched the lightning-like attack.
And when every Spaniard was finally killed... he ordered his warriors to close the mine.
You see, the Spaniards had defiled a holy place... when they came into Superstition... because to the Apaches it was the sacred home of their Thunder Gods.
It wasn't enough to just kill Pedro and his men.
All traces of them and their work had to be erased.
So the mine was completely closed and hidden.
With that accomplished,
Cochise and the Apaches... felt their Thunder Gods were avenged and appeased.
Every mine was closed... so efficiently that they disappeared from view as though they had never existed.
And Pedro's $20 million worth of gold... was buried inside the sacred mountain from which it had been taken.
That's the legend... as the Apaches have told it for over 100 years.
- The Apaches buried all that gold?
- Just like in Fort Knox.
Didn't the other brothers, Ramon or Manuel, ever come back?
Well, they say Ramon came back, but who knows?
You know, I generally charge tourists $10 for telling that yarn.
The mine, where the gold is buried, that's the one my grandfather rediscovered?
So they say. Let's push it along.
- Ray, wait a minute.
- Yeah?
Do I have to go out with you?
I'd like to stay in here a while longer.
Getting you, too? Gold-happy.
You know every tourist I tell that yarn to has to stay in a little while longer.
- All trying to figure out them signs.
- I'm something more than a tourist.
I've got a family interest in that mine.
Well, it's all right with me.
I'll leave you some grub.
But, remember, there's a killer loose in here.
I'd hate to see you end up like Buckley.
Covin's reminder about Buckley... took some of the excitement out of me, but only for a minute.
The Deputy could think I was a fool if he wanted to... but I was determined to try my luck at putting the golden jigsaw together.
For the next five days I beat my brains out... trying to make the Spanish treasure signs pay off.
Fifty yards, they said.
I went 50 yards in every direction but straight up.
If I'd had wings, I'd have tried that.
I began to realise that this was no ordinary puzzle.
I finally thought that maybe if I went over every foot of the area... where the four men had been murdered,
I might find something.
How close I came
I didn't learn till a lot later.
I didn't know I was being stalked... that for a moment I was a bull's eye, a sitting duck.
Number five on the list.
I just kept going, dreaming about being a millionaire.
The only thing I learnt was that the guy who'd murdered Buckley... wasn't the only killer loose in Superstition.
You don't relax right away.
You sort of coast to a stop after a shock like that.
I was almost afraid to look at my leg.
I was sure he'd gotten me.
He hadn't, but he came awful close.
I finally started to breathe again and shook off the shroud of fear... the rattler had thrown over me.
I picked up my pack and started to get up.
That's when I found it buried in the ground.
When I pulled rocks loose to throw at the snake...
I'd uncovered a part of a rifle.
Excitedly, I dug the rest of it out of the gravel.
I didn't have any idea what kind it was, but as I held it in my hands...
I wanted to believe it had been my grandfather's.
Because if it was, it could mean
I was close to the lost mine.
To the gold.
Call it fate, luck, it doesn't matter.
But a rattlesnake that had tried to kill me had led me to this old weapon.
At that moment it seemed I could actually feel the presence of Jacob Walz... in the unfriendly canyon.
Suddenly it was more important to find out about this gun... than to keep on searching for the mine.
So I decided to leave the mountain and bring the gun to you.
- Would you know what kind it is?
- Looks like a Sharps.
- But we're interested in a 30-30.
- Yeah.
But if it is old enough, it could have been my grandfather's, couldn't it?
- I told you he had the bug.
- Let me see it.
I think I got a Sharps here.
A Sharps. A breech-Ioader.
Forty-five-ninety calibre. Lots of 'em around here in the '70s and '80s.
That one killed a sheriff in 1875.
You know, finding this where I did,
I thought I might be near his mine.
That is, if it was his gun.
I never heard anybody say what kind of a weapon Walz used.
If it's so important for you to find out, you might try the Pioneer's Home.
- The Pioneer's Home?
- It's in Phoenix. Old folks' place.
One of those old-timers might be able to tell you about this... and your grandfather, too.
They got nothing else to do up there but talk.
Thanks. I think I'll pay them a visit.
Mrs. Bannister might be able to help you.
She spent her childhood in Florence Junction.
She isn't easy to talk to.
If you'll promise not to upset her...
I won't.
Martha, this is Mr. Storm.
He wants to ask you a few questions.
You know I don't like being bothered.
You've got no right to bring people pestering me.
It's about my grandfather.
He lived here around 1886.
I knew a lot of people who lived here.
What was his name?
Walz. Jacob Walz.
I won't talk about him.
Jacob Walz was a mean, wicked man.
And if you're his grandson, you're probably just like him.
Did I hear you mention Jake Walz?
He was a real sidewinder, that man.
What do you want to know about him?
I'll be glad to tell you.
You're always poking your nose in where you ain't wanted, Bill Bates.
- He didn't ask you.
- My name's Barry Storm.
- You see, Walz was my...
- Checking up on old Jake?
Well, you've come to the right place, young fellow.
- Now, if you want my opinion, l...
- He don't want anything from you.
I'm the one who knows all about Jacob Walz.
I found this gun and...
You like guns, don't you?
You probably go around scaring people with them, just like he did to me.
When I was a girl in Florence Junction, he frightened me.
What you doing, mister?
What you doing?
Why are you playing with that?
Is that gun yours? It's brand new, ain't it?
- Ain't it, mister?
- Come here.
Want to have some fun?
Put your finger in there.
Pull.
Pull harder.
I got buyers for two of our burros.
A Mexican fellow and his partner.
Well, here's your burros.
You got them at a good price, too.
Gonna have a look for that lost Spanish gold?
I guessed right, didn't I?
Everybody looks for it, but nobody ever finds it.
I figure them Indians hid it.
Too good, they hid it.
- What do you mean the Indians hid it?
- That gold is hid forever.
Want to sell back them burros?
I'll give you half what you paid for them.
Well, maybe they ain't hid it good enough. Eh, Peralta?
Silencio!
Keep your mouth shut.
Name of Peralta mean anything to you, Dutchie?
Be a dirty shame if they was to stumble onto something... and we wasn't there to see what is was.
Yeah.
- They're making camp for the night.
- Yeah, it's about time.
The fellows must be part mountain goat, the way they been hightailing it.
Go start a fire down in the gully there, and don't make any smoke.
I'll go unload the burro.
Soon as I play myself a game.
You know, I think you're right about them.
They haven't even stopped to pan one of the streams.
- They know where they're going all right.
- Sure they know where they're going.
You should've seen the way that Mexican jumped down the other fellow's throat... when he started to talk.
You're dang right they know where they're going.
Say, you're lucky I let you in on this.
You go down and build a fire and don't make any smoke.
Just turn up the ace of spades and I can win this game.
Well, it could be the ace of spades.
I won that game.
Them's the settin'est two fellows
I ever seen.
Suppose they sleep setting up that way?
Their fire's going out.
Darn ace of spades never shows up when I need it most.
Beats me every dang game.
Come on!
They tricked us, them shad-bellied hornswogglers!
Made us think they was setting here.
- They won't get away.
- We can pick up a trail.
I figure they went this way.
What do you think?
- Why, sure, Dutchie.
- All right, go get the burro. Go on!
The two who were following us...
I wonder if they follow our trail?
No, we'd have seen them two days before if they had.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
I found the marker and the signs.
We won't have long to wait for the next sign now.
See, the moon is just rising.
I never heard of finding a mine by the light of the moon.
It is 38 years to the day that my brothers and I were here.
You won't forget our agreement?
I am a Mexican.
- I cannot file a claim for this mine.
- No, I won't forget.
I file the claim as an American citizen, and we go 50-50.
We must get to the ledge below.
There's nothing here.
It's been many years, but I'm sure this is the place.
Maybe the old burro-seller's right.
Maybe the Indians did cover it up.
We dig here.
My old legs are killing me.
I'm getting too old to be traipsing around these mountains.
When we go back, lets go to Phoenix instead by way of Florence Junction.
What do you say, Dutchie?
You never been to Phoenix, have you?
It's a real live town.
I remember once I was...
Look at it! Gold! Sacks of it, already mined!
We've got a storehouse.
I tell you it's the richest gold ore you ever seen.
Come on.
Gold!
Joe, what is it?
Fellow found gold in Superstition,
Mrs. Thomas.
Brung back nuggets as big as your fist.
- What's happening?
- Parsons is weighing it now.
- Stranger, you've hit it rich.
- How much?
- For that ore, I'd say close to $40,000 a ton.
- $40,000 a ton.
- That's bigger than the California strike.
- How much?
$40,000 a ton!
- Bonanza!
- $40,000 a ton.
- Can you imagine?
- Go and buy up every burro in town. Hurry.
- How much?
- It's over $40,000.
- It's way over $40,000.
- Nearly $50,000.
- How much for what I brought in?
- A mite less than 300 pounds.
- I'll give you $5,000 for it.
- It's worth $6,000.
Refined, maybe. As it is, no.
- Let's see.
- Stop crowding me, will you?
All right, $5,000.
What's your name?
I have to have your name on this receipt.
- Walz. Jacob Walz.
- What's his name?
He said his name was Jacob Walz.
- Who is he?
- Jacob Walz.
- Must be a Dutchman.
- Or a German.
Yeah, that's what I said, a Dutchman.
Jacob Walz.
Sign it.
It's a receipt stating I paid you $5,000... for 297.5 pounds of gold ore.
- You ain't paid me yet.
- I will.
You've got to sign it. It's the law.
Is he signing his name?
- I don't know.
- He isn't even signing his name.
- He can't even write his own name.
- He can't read nor write.
How do you like that, Julia?
A stupid foreigner that can't even read or write finds $1 million gold mine.
And you get $11 a week clerking in a hardware store.
You and your high-school diploma.
And ten 50s make $5,000.
You're sure going to file a claim, ain't you?
I'd like to talk to you about a deal you might find interesting.
Whereabouts is this strike?
Ain't you going to file a claim, mister?
Boy, you really struck it rich.
I'll bet that ore is worth more than Parsons said.
- That gold has got...
- He got $5,000...
Pete.
Pete, where are you?
Get off my bed.
How many times must I tell you to stay out of my room, unless you're invited?
I've got a right to lie on your bed.
I'm your husband.
Come into the other room.
I want to talk to you.
Talk to me in here.
Julia!
That's right, Pete. Come in.
All right. What do you want?
Sit down.
A man named Jacob Walz has just arrived in town.
- I want to meet him.
- Why?
He's discovered gold.
What do you want to meet him for?
I've got a right to know.
Really?
Well, I have a right to some things, too.
Like being sick and tired of running a bakery.
- Wait a minute.
- You've had four years to get me out of here.
- I've had bad luck. I'm doing the best I can.
- Yes, you've done very well.
Have you been able to keep a job?
Have you replaced our savings... you so cleverly invested in grazing land no animal could live on? Have you, Pete?
- That wasn't my fault. I got swindled.
- No, I got swindled.
So now, you're going to bring that man here.
- No, I won't, Julia.
- Yes, you will.
There's still that unsolved murder in Milwaukee.
- All right.
- Good.
Of course, he's not to know that I'm married to you.
- But you are married to me.
- Yes, but he's not to know.
You understand, Pete?
- What do you want of him?
- I'm not sure yet.
But I am sure I'm not going to stay here and dry up... like the other women in this filthy town.
I'll get a job driving the stage to Tucson or mining up in Gold Field.
Yes. He's at Luke's Saloon now.
Buy him drinks or whatever he wants.
Just see that I meet him, Pete.
Pete?
There's some money on the floor.
He's been here close to eight hours.
How long can he go on?
- Come on, Walz. Tell us where the...
- No!
Very good, how about buying you a drink, mister?
I buy my own drinks.
I could buy the whole place if I wanted to.
Where'd you strike it rich, Dutchie?
Come on, tell us.
- You want to hear about the mine?
- Is there much of this high-grade ore, Walz?
That? That's nothing.
Why, that's just some of the loose stuff
I picked up on the outside of the mine.
You mean on the outside?
On the inside of the mine, there's a vein of gold as thick as...
- As thick as her waist.
- Where is it? Come on, tell us.
All right, I'll tell you.
From the mine, you can see the old military trail.
- Yeah?
- Then, it is in Superstition?
But from the trail, you can't see the mine.
You've been teasing and horsing us around all night, Walz.
Now, you tell us where you struck it rich or shut up.
- Put up or shut up.
- That's telling him.
- It's about time somebody told him off.
- The blowhard.
- Maybe I'll file a claim.
- What?
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
You'd know right where to look.
That'd make it easy for you.
Well, come on up and try to find it.
And I'll be waiting for you.
I'll give you a real welcome.
That's telling them, Walz.
How about buying you a drink?
He told you before, he can buy his own drinks. Come on, honey.
Are you really a Dutchman, honey?
I bet Elsie you was a German. Was I right?
What, honey?
Bring me a drink.
Had enough of that Dutchman tonight.
I bet you get awful Ionesome up in the mountains all alone.
It ain't natural for a man to be by himself all the time, honey.
When you go back to your mine, maybe you ought to take a little company.
Maybe like taking Lucille with you?
You're just like the rest. All you want is my gold. That's all any of you want!
I don't want none of your gold, mister.
Not tonight.
- Get out of my place!
- You dirty...
Stop it, Lucille. You heard me, get out.
All right. You won't let me stay in... and I won't let you come out.
He's bluffing.
Relax, boss, another half minute, he'll fall on his face.
Get out of here, you drunken...
Take it easy.
Come on, Jim. Let's get him.
- Where'd he get to?
- Where'd he go?
- He disappeared, Julia.
- Not so loud, Pete.
- I tried to bring him home.
- He's inside now.
Unconscious, passed out here on the street.
Now, please don't come back until I send for you.
- Julia.
- Please.
Good night, Pete.
Well, at last. Good morning.
How do you feel now?
Here's some coffee. Fresh roll.
You may wash up in there.
- How'd I get here?
- You were lying in the doorway of my shop.
- You were quite sick.
- I was drunk last night.
- Either way, I still couldn't leave you there.
- Why?
- Why?
- Yeah.
Because I felt sorry for you.
What other reasons are there?
- How much do I owe you?
- Owe me?
- Yeah, here.
- Why, nothing.
Very glad you're feeling better now.
My name is Jacob Walz.
I'm glad to know you, Mr. Walz.
I'm Julia Thomas.
- You do not know who I am?
- No, should I?
Everybody in town's talking about me.
- Why?
- I found a bonanza.
- What?
- Gold.
I found the richest gold mine in the world.
That's nice.
Would you like some more coffee?
- You have no interest?
- Should I have?
Mr. Walz, I don't know anything about gold mines.
I just know about baking, and trying to run my little shop.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I do have to get the baking done.
You don't even want to know where my mine is.
I wouldn't know a gold mine if I fell into one.
- I'm very much obliged to you.
- You're welcome.
May I call upon you sometime?
- Well, l...
- This evening?
All right, if you wish.
Excuse me.
- Good morning, Mrs. Butler.
- How much are them?
- 20 cents a dozen.
- That's outrageous.
- And them?
- The same.
You ought to be ashamed charging such prices.
- But they're the lowest in town.
- Ever since that gold strike... everybody's charging four times what things is worth, and you ain't no different.
Criminals, all of you.
Give me half a dozen of them.
- Very well.
- The freshest ones, mind you.
- All this stuff's been sold.
- What?
- It belongs to me.
- Why, you can't do...
- And you get out.
- You can't talk to...
- You get out!
- I won't stand it!
You get out and you stay out!
Herr Walz, you shouldn't have done that.
She was one of my best customers.
You let people talk to you that way?
When a woman has to support herself... it's necessary to endure many unpleasant things.
I buy everything.
- Really, there's nothing...
- It's for sale?
- Yes, but...
- All right, I buy everything.
You wrap it up. I take it with me.
- Everything?
- Here.
- Hey, you like cookies?
- Yes, sir.
Here.
- All of them?
- Yeah.
Good evening.
- Gum drops.
- Thank you. How nice.
Won't you come in?
Please. Won't you sit down?
I'm much obliged to you for taking me in last night.
It was nothing at all.
I'm much obliged to you.
- Why?
- For the biggest day's business I've had... since I came to Phoenix. I've sold out.
- Would you like to see the album?
- Yes, I would.
This is my mother, my father.
He died when I was seven.
That was after they came from Germany.
- Oh, dear. Not that one.
- Here, wait a minute.
I keep meaning to take it out of there.
It's so embarrassing.
You grew up fine.
Let me see.
I was born and raised in Milwaukee.
This is the house we lived in.
And this is my mother's uncle.
He's in Dresden now.
- And this is...
- When did you come here?
About four years ago.
Why did you come here?
After my mother passed away,
I just didn't want to stay there anymore.
I thought this was as good a place as any for a woman to make her own way.
Now, this is...
- Herr Walz, do you like music?
- Who doesn't like music?
Herr Walz.
- I'm sorry.
- Good night.
Please.
I didn't want to make you angry.
It was just that you are so very beautiful.
Good night, Herr Walz.
Don't assume you can take liberties... simply because
I'm a businesswoman living alone.
- May I call upon you again?
- Good night.
- You may use this door.
- Please, may I call upon you again?
Tomorrow?
All right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, Fräulein.
That's her husband sitting over there.
You think that Dutchman would've found out about him by now.
Walz doesn't even know she's married.
Folks are scared to tell him.
Walz would shoot your head off, if you said anything.
How many trips has Walz made to that mine since he met her?
Five. Maybe six.
Next.
How long will it be?
Let me see. I've got this gentleman here.
He can have my place.
What's so funny?
- Give me a shave.
- Yes, sir.
Just got back into town?
Only been gone five days.
Who is that fellow?
Him?
He's the fellow that gave you his place.
Pete, what are you doing here?
I told you not to come back unless I sent for you.
Everybody in town knows what's going on but him.
- And they're laughing at me.
- Stop acting like a child.
- Why'd I do it?
- Do what?
Get up and run out of that barbershop like a scared rabbit.
And all the time I wanted to...
- What are you so dressed up for?
- He said he'd be back today.
And I don't want him to find you here.
You've seen him nine or 10 times.
How long will this go on?
- What difference does it make?
- Julia, don't see him anymore.
- You're a fool.
- You're the smart one.
Only not as smart as you thought you were.
Not smart enough to get any of his money or to find out where his mine is.
I know what I'm doing.
He'll be here any minute.
Have you told him yet?
Have you told him you're married... that you're somebody else's wife?
- Pete, I want you to leave.
- Somebody will tell him.
Maybe somebody in the barbershop already told him.
He'll find out.
He'll find out you're after the same thing everybody else is after.
Get out.
I won't stand for you fooling around with that Dutchman.
Let go of me. You're mussing my dress.
Let loose of me.
I'll send for you when I want you.
That's him.
Go out the back door. Go on.
This is it.
He pays off tonight, or it's the last night.
And when I come back it'll be through the front door, Julia.
Jacob.
Every time I see you, you are more beautiful.
All the way to and from the mine...
I keep practicing pretty speeches to say to you.
When I see you, I forget them.
Do people talk to you about me, about us?
- No one would dare. Why?
- There's something I must tell you.
What is it?
I should have told you a long time ago, but I never thought it would be necessary.
I'm married. I have been for five years.
I couldn't lie to you, not now.
I don't love my husband.
Now I know I never have.
All I want is to be free of him.
- You don't care for him?
- No. I love you, Jacob.
- What's his name?
- Pete Thomas.
- Will he give you a divorce?
- Divorce?
For money. Will he give you a divorce?
I don't know.
Here's $2,000. We'll set a limit, say $5,000.
Will that be enough for him?
Perhaps.
But he must sign a paper giving you a divorce.
I know about these things.
I was married once myself.
My wife divorced me, took my daughter away from me... all because my wife didn't sign a paper.
So he must sign that paper before he gets a penny of money.
Will you make the arrangements?
- No, I'll do it myself.
- No, Jacob. I know I can.
Good. When did he get back?
Tonight.
What is it, Jacob?
I'm going back to the mine tonight to get more money for us.
I love you.
I love you, Julia, and I want to marry you.
Soon, there will be just you and I.
Yes, Jacob. Just you and I.
Hey, everybody, I just saw the Dutchman.
He woke up old man Parsons.
Made him open up his store to get his grub.
I saw him head for the corral.
He's on his way back to the mine.
I don't know. Go after him.
Give me a drink, one for the road.
You and your big mouth, you wreck our business.
We got to find that mine.
Come on. Wake up.
What is it?
- I want you to get my burros ready.
- It's you.
What for? You just got back.
It ain't decent waking a man in the middle of the night.
- Not for burros.
- Do you know a Pete Thomas?
I ain't no gossip. I mind my own business.
I didn't ask you for any gossip.
I asked you if you knew him.
We say howdy when we meet.
I haven't seen him much lately.
He ain't used no animals for a spell.
- How long has he been here?
- I don't know. Three or four years.
Ever since him and his wife came here from Milwaukee.
I'll start rounding up them dang burros for you now.
I don't see why you can't wait until morning, though.
Where did he go?
Must be getting old.
I can't seem to remembering him going.
Corral, I guess.
It's safe to go home now.
The Dutchman's gone.
Did you have a nice evening?
Did he pay off, or do you have to see him just once more?
I'm glad you're back.
He gave me this. $2,000 and there'll be more.
This is for you, Pete, and the rest is coming.
- More than that if you want it.
- I don't want his money, understand?
- Let go of me and listen.
- No, you listen to me for a change.
You're through with him, and this time I'll make sure of it.
What do you mean?
When he comes back from the mine he'll find me here, where I belong.
I'll tell him how you played him for a sucker.
You're like the rest, only worse.
You pretend to be decent.
I'll tell him the whole rotten story, from beginning to end.
The whole story, Pete?
Yes, including the murder.
It won't matter if you turn me in.
It won't matter at all... because when I'm through with him
I'll have a second one to my credit...
Jacob Walz.
- You've got to listen to me.
- Try to buy me off, would he?
He can't do it.
Wait a minute. Whose idea was this?
- Did he think it up all by himself?
- No, he didn't.
It was my idea, all mine.
I don't like those kinds of ideas.
I'll kill him before he gets out of town.
Don't be silly.
The only way I could get the money was to tell him you could be bought off.
You're still my wife.
I'm not lying to you.
He thinks you'll give me a divorce for money.
There was no other way of getting it.
Don't you understand?
Could it be that it isn't just his gold you're interested in... that you've been lying to me?
Could that be?
- Don't be a fool.
- Answer me. Are you in love with him?
I've told you over and over again, all I want is his gold.
- For us.
- I don't want anything from him.
Not even his mine?
Once I find out where it is, he'll be no problem to us.
- Julia, you aren't lying to me?
- No.
You really leaving tonight?
The guy said you were on your way back to the mine.
- When you leaving?
- What's the matter, Dutchie?
Come on, Walz. We're friends.
You've had enough now to kill a horse.
Why don't you take your business somewhere else?
Ain't they buying gold in Tucson or other places?
Every time you leave Phoenix, you take half the town with you.
Everybody trying to follow you and find out where that mine is.
I'll bet there's a hundred of our customers waiting... to follow you into that mountain right now.
Take your gold and go to some other town.
You ruin our business coming here.
Get me a pencil and a piece of paper.
There's Weaver's Needle.
There's the runway.
That's the ledge 200 yards from the cactus marker.
- The mine's just below that.
- I see.
- I'm not coming back to Phoenix.
- What?
Too many people following me out of town.
Crowd's getting bigger and it's getting harder to lose on the trail.
We'll meet somewhere else, doesn't matter where.
- But, Jacob, I thought...
- You can get a divorce anywhere.
You can leave your husband the same way my wife left me.
Is there anything wrong with that?
No, only I thought...
Of course, if you didn't mean what you said about us.
If you lied.
Oh, no.
I did mean it, Jacob.
There's no sense giving him any money.
I've thought it over.
Can't I go with you now?
I'd never lose those people on the trail if you were with me.
- You're so strange.
- Will you meet me at the mine or won't you?
Yes, I'll meet you there.
It may take me two or three extra days because of the crowd.
- You'll be there ahead of me.
- Yes, I'll be waiting at the mine for you.
What did he want?
What did he come back for?
Nothing. Just to see me again.
Planning on running out on me, Julia?
No, Pete.
You know I wouldn't go without you.
I do now.
And I know something else.
You're in love with him.
You've been lying to me about that, too.
But we're going to the mine together.
You're going to be there when I kill him.
Do you understand?
Let me see that map again.
There's Weaver's Needle. We're almost there.
And I can hardly wait.
This is it.
This is the runway he told you about.
What if he's here?
He said it would take him two or three extra days.
Anyway, he expects me.
If he is here, you get him out where I can see him.
Jacob.
Pete, come on down. It's all right.
He's not here.
Look at it, Julia, just look at it.
Now I see why he always got back to town so soon.
All he had to do is pick it up.
Pete.
It's worth millions.
Bring the burros down here.
The runway we came down is the only way on or off this ledge.
Go on.
You were so anxious to be ready for him.
You're right.
Julia!
- They're gone. Everything's gone.
- What?
Our supplies, the food, the water, everything. It's gone.
- Maybe the burros just wandered away.
- No, they were tied up.
- He's already here. He knows.
- No.
Call to him. Get him out in the open. Go on.
Jacob, where are you?
I didn't want to bring him. I didn't want to.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to bring him. He made me do it.
Please, darling. Help me.
Quick, before he finds out I'm gone.
You fool.
Get away from me.
All right, what are you waiting for?
Get it over with.
Pete, ask him for water. Go on.
You want her?
Take her. You can have her.
Nobody wants you.
From the beginning, it was her idea.
I don't want your gold. I never did.
If you want her, take her. You can have her.
You see, Jacob, I've gotten rid of him.
I killed him for you.
Now you know I wasn't lying to you.
It's all over.
It's just you and me now, remember?
Just like you wanted it.
You love me. You said you did.
We can be married now, just like you said.
I wasn't lying to you, Jacob.
He forced me to bring him with me.
I didn't want to.
You've got to believe me. You've got to.
I proved I loved you when I killed him.
Please help me.
I want you.
All you ever wanted was my gold.
Well, now you've got it.
This record only goes back to 1912.
Arizona didn't become a state till then.
But you got the right dope from those old newspapers.
I remember for a fact it was in 1910... two years before we had a coroner's office.
What are you two talking about?
I'm checking up on a female skeleton found in Superstition.
If Bill Bates was right, that skeleton was Julia Thomas'... the woman my grandfather was in love with.
If you don't stop harping about this Walz business... somebody's going to swear out a lunacy complaint.
But, Ray, I've got a lot to go on now.
First, I found that rifle.
Then I checked the stories of the old folks at the Pioneer's Home.
I even learnt that an earthquake did hit Superstition.
- It was on May 3rd, 1887.
- Who cares?
I'm going back to that canyon where I found that rifle.
So long, fellas.
Might as well clear off one of my tables.
Be just my luck they bring him in on Sunday.
- Did you find your mine yet?
- Nope.
But I'm on my way back to Superstition right now.
You better be careful.
There's still a killer up there.
I got nothing to lose, except my life.
The sky clouded up... and the wind tried to blow a scare into me... as I made my way back to the treasure signs.
Three days later... the clouds got out of the sky and into my brain.
I got lost.
I couldn't even find the canyon where I'd uncovered the old gun.
Like an idiot...
I fumbled in and out of one gorge after another... pushing along with no more sense or reason... than if I had been on a treadmill.
I knew I had to locate the rock called Weaver's Needle... before I could even start looking for the lost mine.
Then, with sheer blind luck
I walked right into it.
Here was the spot I'd found the gun, killed the rattlesnake.
And I had my starting point.
A short distance away I found the cliff... from which I could see the old military trail.
Jacob Walz had said that from his mine he could see the trail... but from the trail nobody could see the mine.
I set out to prove he'd told the truth.
Now, I'm a guy who gets dizzy just standing on a high kerb.
But even when the ground dropped out from under me... like a deceitful friend,
I kept scrambling along the cliff side... keeping the trail in sight.
When you're sick with gold fever you have no patience with caution.
All you think of is getting your hooks into... that glittering pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
I followed the edge of that cliff... staying within view of the trail for the next three days.
My fever began to go down as discouragement set in... and I was about ready to give up and go home, when suddenly...
I came on a wide ledge.
Gradually, it dawned on me that here... the trail was in sight but that a mine couldn't be seen from below.
And then I found the map, the strange map carved in a stone.
This was something I hadn't expected.
I got as excited as a poker player filling an inside straight flush.
They looked like old Spanish markings.
A sort of master map of the region.
But the doodles didn't make any sense, because I didn't know how to read them.
Then I found that hole... and realized it had been drilled into the rock for some reason.
I didn't have any idea what the reason could be... but I picked up a stick and began probing to try and find out.
I peered along the stick... but its direction pointed out nothing
I hadn't seen before.
Then I discovered... though it looked like just a single hole on the outside... there were actually several on the inside.
My second look didn't lead anyplace either.
But the third started bells ringing in my head.
It pointed my eyes at a strange kind of peak... a startling rock formation with a window in its top.
I felt as if Santa Claus had just climbed down my chimney.
I began making tracks for that peak.
As I clawed and climbed my way towards the window above... one thought kept repeating itself.
Nobody, not Ray Covin, the Sheriff,
Bill Bates... nobody had ever mentioned the weird map cut in the rocks... or this peak that had been pointed out by the stick in the hole.
I'd discovered these things all by myself.
What I knew was top secret, private knowledge for Barry Storm.
I felt sure that at last, finally...
I was on the express road to the Lost Dutchman... and my grandfather's fabulous mine... where I'd find lumps of gold piled up like rubble.
I was so dreamy, I figured all I had to do was crawl through that window... and the mine was on the other side.
But there wasn't any mine, there was nothing.
I figured I'd crawled behind another eight-ball.
Then I realized this arch was man-made.
It did add up to something.
And when I saw my shadow on the valley floor...
I knew this window was the key to the gold.
My whole future was in that square of light below.
I raced back to the wall map to fix its location in my mind... then got started on that last lap to fame and fortune.
But something had changed.
It wasn't like I'd left it.
Looking for this?
Ray, what are you doing here?
- Looking for you.
- What for? Ray, I got it.
I found the window cut in the rock.
It's a sort of a light sign.
It casts a shadow that points to a spot where the gold may be buried.
- And the spot is...
- Go on.
Of course, it may not mean anything at all.
- What did you come back for?
- Another murder.
Drop your gun belt.
You shut up fast when you thought you'd found something.
You don't want a partner and neither do I.
You killed Buckley.
I've been looking for that gold for 20 years, Storm.
If anybody's going to get it, it's going to be me.
You're right about that light sign.
And some night it's going to show me where the gold is.
Turn around.
Start walking.
We'll send a posse in after you in a couple of weeks.
No murder here.
Your bones will show you just died of a bad fall.
Keep walking. Right to the end.
Covin makes victim number 21.
Good thing Walter trailed you, or you'd still be explaining this.
Too bad he didn't get up in time to help you.
But why were you having me tailed?
I wasn't. I was after Ray.
It wasn't any accident
I sent Walter with you the first time.
Ray had a funny habit of being out of the office... whenever these murders happened.
And he was always so fast locating the bodies.
I stayed behind that first time after Covin told me to go back.
When I saw him raise his gun about to shoot you, I knew he was the killer.
Then you've been using me for a clay pigeon.
Kind of.
I couldn't arrest my own deputy just on knowing.
I had to prove Covin was the murderer.
That's why I was waiting for you to go in again.
I knew if you got too close, he'd have to make a pass at you.
Well, let's get going.
I want to be out of here before dark.
I'm not going with you.
I got a date up there tonight.
Mind a little company?
Ought to be kind of interesting... watching a man just dig up $20 million.
All I'm waiting for is that full moon.
When it comes through that window... it'll light up the patch of ground where I'm to dig.
That's all I'll need.
Look at it.
I'm standing right in the centre of it.
Right here.
This is where I dig.
My grandfather's gold.
$20 million worth.
It's moved.
It was here, that square light. Now it's there.
You hadn't figured on that, Storm?
You forgot the moon and earth keep moving.
At this rate, you'll have to dig up the whole mountain.
Need a bulldozer.
That earthquake changed things, too.
That's why Ray Covin never found the mine.
That's why you'll never find it.
That's right.
If it is the moon that'll point out that gold, it'll only do it once a year.
On the anniversary of the night the Peraltas made that sign.
That's the catch.
When was that sign made?
What night, what hour, what moment?
If I could figure that out, I'd hit the jackpot.
And if you did, this county would need a new sheriff... because I'd be right there digging with you.
Come on, let's go.
Well, that's the story as far as I'm concerned.
The whole biography of
Superstition Mountain won't be finished... till somebody takes that gold away from her.
The treasure signs, the marker... the light sign, they're all genuine.
Maybe you can figure out that strange map carved in the stone.
I've got a hunch it holds the key to the fortune.
Anyway, everything's all there in the mountain.
And if you're interested... you might like to know that any citizen of the United States... has the legal right to search for gold.
And you don't have to pay anybody for the privilege.
If you should find Superstition's treasure, the State of Arizona... and the Government of the United States will recognise your claim to it.
Like I said at the beginning... if you'd like to pick up $20 million,
I'll show you where to look.
Well, I've shown you.
The North Star (1943) 1hr 48min
Good morning, my little honey bees.
Good morning!
Good morning. Good morning.
Good morning, one and all.
Good... Morning!
Good morning!
Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
Where's Pavel Grigorich?
I've come to be your guest for breakfast.
Stop shouting.
Don't be so young with the voice.
You'll have to come back, Comrade Karp.
Grandpa is still asleep.
A new baby came to the hospital last night, and then Grandpa came home and did his writing.
Good morning.
That's not the way you say it.
You say, "a baby came into the bright world in the darkest part of the night."
Don't talk so pretty.
A new baby. Isn't that nice?
What's nice about it?
I -- I'll be back.
You argue too much.
Heep!
Good morning, Grandpa.
Ah. Good morning, my lad.
You should not have worked all night.
Mm. I had a good night's work.
Did a little writing.
Feel better? Mm-hmm.
Come and have breakfast now.
Oh, dear.
What seems to be the trouble, Boris Stepanich?
It'll take a better mechanic than I am to answer that.
The patient is cured, Father.
It's all right now.
Hello, Comrade Karp.
You ever been to Kiev?
Of course.
There was a pretty girl there who lost her head over me.
Years ago. Oh, of course.
Well, it is the last day of school.
Tomorrow morning, we'll be on our way.
It's our vacation, and we're going to Kiev on a holiday.
That's a nice bus ride.
Not for us. We're hiking.
All the way? Well, of course.
It'll only take us four or five days.
Only?
Marina is going?
Yes. Marina and
Clavdia and grisha.
My brother -- unfortunately.
Ah, but Marina is the one who counts.
Have you proposed?
Or does one propose in these modern times?
Good morning, Papa.
Good morning.
What are you doing, Marina?
I'm baking honey cakes for the trip.
The cakes have to be baked now?
You're not leaving until tomorrow.
Well, it's hard at our age to remember how exciting a trip can be.
The planning is half the fun.
A long time ago, this is the way I wore my hair.
Were you pretty, Mama, when you were young?
I'm not so old, little one.
Mama's pretty now.
And she's not old.
It's only that you're so young.
I'm not so young.
There are plenty who are younger.
Yes. And there always will be.
Sophia, when you go marketing, remind everybody to come and help with the loading of the trains.
Tell them there will be supper for all when the work is finished.
I'll tell everybody!
I'll tell everybody!
May I, Papa? May I?
I'll do it on my way to school.
Please, may I? May I, please?
All right. You tell them.
I'll say there will be supper for everybody.
Yes.
I'll say there will be music and singing.
I'll say there will be dancing, and I'll say there will be cider for old people and fruit drinks for children.
You might also remember to say there will be work.
Oh.
Yes. I'll say that, too.
"Everybody must work," I'll say.
No pancakes?
You know what else the comrade commander said to me?
You have my permission not to tell me.
"Eat pancakes."
That's what he said.
It has been recently discovered that pancakes are fine for a bombardier's nerves.
That ought to interest you, Damian.
You're going to be a doctor.
It doesn't interest me.
Don't worry with those maps, Damian.
I know all the roads.
And when we get to Kiev,
I will show you and your little friends all there is to see.
Me and my little friends are still young.
A visit to Kiev is something that doesn't happen to us every day.
And don't patronize us about it.
Be a man of the world in front of your mirror.
It's better that way.
Mirrors don't talk back.
Hmm!
Most men in the world feel pleased when they have sons.
I wonder why.
I told you years ago.
Two quiet little girls would have been very nice.
Well, you can't change us now, and you wouldn't if you could.
Two healthy, brilliant, handsome sons.
June 20, 1941, 8:00 A.M., broadcasting from moscow.
Be still, both of you.
German troop movements are reported on the Polish border.
Their nature is unknown.
Reports reach us of a typhus epidemic in the German-occupied city of Warsaw.
London was bombed twice last night by the Luftwaffe.
In the Polish city of Lodz,
112 Polish children died this morning as a result of being made to give blood transfusions to German wounded.
Children. Taking blood from...
Here's a report from a reliable source in -- goodbye, now.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Papa. Bye, baby.
Goodbye, Papa.
Bye, Mama. Bye, dear.
Come on, Clavdia!
You'll be late!
You're my brother, not my guardian.
Mind your business.
Good morning, Clavdia.
Good morning, Marina.
You're early.
Oh! You know I never eat breakfast.
You always look so clean.
You're no cleaner than I am.
Maybe not as clean.
And hair is curly.
Your hair looks nice.
Oh, it's as straight as wheat.
And don't try to console me.
Well, well.
The last day of school is a happy day.
Even I remember.
Oh, no. No?
We're very sorry it's the last day.
My first words will be to congratulate our three pupils in the last class who have all been awarded scholarships to the state
University of Kiev.
One of those three has taken the highest marks of any pupil in this year's senior graduating class.
He is Damian Taratsa.
It is not my custom to start your vacation with a lecture.
But this is the summer of 1941, a solemn time.
No one of us knows what will happen.
I don't have to remind you that we are people with a noble history.
You are expected to carry on that history with complete devotion and self-sacrifice.
I think you'll do that.
And now... Have a happy summer.

You know, Marina...
I-I can't explain it, but, well, I-I almost wish we weren't having this supper tonight.
Oh, goodness knows
I usually love it.
But -- but it interferes, really, with the trip, if you know what I mean.
Too many good things at once.
Mm. I felt it, too.
I didn't want anything to happen.
Just the trip. Nothing else.
Oh, well. We really won't celebrate tonight.
We'll just eat supper and act like it was any other evening and we were home with the family.
You know what? I'm not going to sing tonight.
Even if everyone asks me, I won't sing.
And don't you sing either.
Mnh-mnh.

I wish it was tomorrow morning.
Kolya says we'll go to the theater when we get to Kiev.
All we have to do is apply for the tickets.
We'll have three whole days in Kiev.
We shall see everything.
It's been a good year.
Scholarship to the university, of course, means the most.
There was a medal for marksmanship.
And now this vacation.
We'll be separated for a year.
You'll be getting a scholarship the following year.
But it's this year
I'm thinking about.
That's a long time.
I don't think it is at our age.
You don't think so?
How strange.
What are you saying, Marina?
Nothing. I don't want to talk about it.
It's odd you don't think a year away from me is a long time.
It doesn't worry you?
No.
All right.
You don't have to keep saying it over and over.
Are you sure you feel about me as you used to?
I don't like this talk.
It -- it's bad.
It's only natural that I -- it's not natural at all.
It's not like you.
I've loved you since I was old enough to see you.
I will love you until I die.
That's the way it is, and there's no need to talk about it.
You mean you'll never talk about it?
You'll never tell me?
I'll tell you in my own time.
But I'll not tell you to waste time.
Look here, Marina.
You and I are -- are like one person.
And I always thought you wanted both of us to be educated and --
I didn't mean that.
Of course I want you to go to the university.
Of course.
It'd make me sad if you didn't -- and ashamed.
But it wouldn't matter.
I'd go anyway.
I'm a citizen of this country.
I intend to go forward with it and -- and to give it all I have.
I have strong feelings about it.
You'll come along with those feelings.
But... You don't come before them.
I understand.
I feel the same way for myself, for both of us.
I was being foolish.
I only wanted to be with you.
I'm proud you got the scholarship, of course.
You'll be a great man, and the whole district will be proud of you.
You'll have medals.
I think we'll go to the theater every night.
That's too often.
And we'll grow old together, and I'll be a beautiful old woman and very kind.
Oh, I'm sure of it.
My grandchildren will love me, and you will, too, more than ever.
What's wrong with that?
Plenty of people grow old together and have a fine life behind them.
I didn't say there was anything wrong with it.
I shall buy baby dresses in Kiev.
For whom?
For our first...
Our grandchildren.
Oh.
You'll, um, you'll put the dresses away for a while?
Yes. Of course that's what I mean.
When we get home, you and
I should call a meeting, and the five of us should go over all the plans for our journey tomorrow.
Don't you think, Kolya?
I don't need to plan to get up and get dressed and eat my breakfast.
I know how to do that.
I'm getting tired of hearing you children talk about this trip.
I'm only going because
Father made me.
Oh.
Oh, I thought it was because
-- well, because me.
I-I mean us.
Don't you like us?
No.
Oh.
What's the matter with you, Clavdia?
I-I have a choking sensation in my chest.
You eat too much.
You usually do.
It's not at all that.
It's my emotions in the chest.
Clavdia, you're a throwback.
What's that? What do you mean?
Somebody who doesn't belong to their own time.
Ours is a new world, Clavdia.
You don't belong in it.
Oh, I see.
You mean I'm rather old-fashioned and romantic, rather.
Yeah.
No.
I've told you -- you cannot come along.
I'm always too young.
I'm too young for everything.
Well, someday, when everybody else is too old for everything, you'll be just old enough.
Take care of the puppy.
I'll bring everybody a present.
Don't get your feet wet.
And take care of yourselves.
Goodbye.
Goodbye!
Papa.
Goodbye.
The first time we have ever been separated, Grandpa.
It's only for a short time.
Good morning.
Clumsy in the body are those clumsy in the head.
You wake Grandpa and I'll -- oh, I'm gonna kill you, you nasty little thing.
I'm gonna kill you.
Drink your milk, Clavdia.
You will now find it more comfortable to get up.
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Seven times last night you said goodbye.
We'll be back soon.
We'll try to get along without you.
Well, goodbye!
Oh, Mother.
We'll be back soon.
Oh, have a good time, son.
We'll miss you.
Damian?
Damian!
Coming!
Good journey, Marina.
Good journey.
Good journey! Good journey!
Good journey!
Good journey to us all!
Kolya!
Good morning, Kolya.
- Good morning!
- Hello.
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
Hey!
Good morning, Clavdia.
What's the matter with you?
With your face?
You look so foolish.
Well, you never said "good morning" to me before.
Good morning!
Good morning, Kolya.
Good morning!
I don't like guns, Kolya.
Then don't have one.
I don't like the noise they make.
Who does? Why are you carrying it?
If you look at me, Clavdia, you will see that I'm in uniform.
Men in uniform carry guns.
Uniforms, air force,
Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.
Remember now?
Oh, you're teasing me.
Well, don't play with that gun, please.
I intend to use it.
When we near the end of the trip,
I intend to kill someone and leave their carcass for the hawks.
You want to help?
Oh, no. No. I will stop you.
I-I will sacrifice myself.
Oh, I couldn't stand to think of you lying in jail, a murderer, tortured with conscience.
Oh, Kolya.
I've got to kill him. But who?
Damian.
Two weeks of you, child, is going to be a long, long time.

Don't your feet hurt?
In the army, your feet learn to stop hurting.
I told you young athletes not to walk so far and so fast the first day.
Make a fire.
We must have a fire.
A fire is so romantic.
Oh, we must have a fire.
Otherwise, we can't sit around and dream.
Maybe it would be better to kill you.
Do, um, do all men make noises when they sleep?
I don't know. I never listen to all men.
Hey, it's Karp.
Oh! Karp!
Good morning, Karp!
Good morning!
Good morning. Good morning.
I thought we'd pass you.
We're on our way home.
I'll give you a ride to the crossroads.
Good! It's time for a ride.
You can't go on a walking trip and take a ride. You can't.
Well, you see more if you walk, but we'd only be riding a few miles.
Oh, come on.
And riding's good for the feet.
Well, well. Nothing like having good feet.
My feet are not good.
They're much too small.
Everybody knows that.
I think we should walk.
You can't go on a walking trip and take a ride.
Who made up that law?
It's not a law. It's just -- well, it's -- it's not romantic.
I see.
You and Marina walk.
We men will ride.
Would you ride while I walked?
Darling Marina, I'm not making you walk.
But would you let me walk while you rode?
The brightest of women are not bright.
I'm learning that.
We are women.
Different things go on in our heads.
That's what makes us attractive.
You coming?
If you're quite certain you want me.
A fine marriage yours will be.
Boss you and then laugh at you.
Oh, come on, Clavdia.
When you don't stand by your convictions, you set back the cause of all women everywhere in the world.
She's an interesting type, Clavdia.
Like a piece in a museum.

They're many planes, and they're not far from here.

Clavdia?
No.
I guess it's the first time in my life I haven't been hungry.
Oh, yesterday we were home, and everybody in the -- one day you're home, and the next day...
The next day, here you are.
Last week, the little boy was in the store with his mother.
I met them there.
He had a ball, and he was bouncing it with his left hand.
I remember because I noticed he was left-handed and wondered what it felt like to be left-handed.
And now there he is without his left hand.
Without the hand that bounced the ball!
Oh! I shouldn't be talking this way!
I know it!
You're all ashamed of me.
You are what you are, Clavdia.
It is my opinion that the trouble in the world comes from people who don't know what they are, who pretend to be something they're not.
Come on, Clavdia.
I'll wash your face.
Dirty cheeks.
Go back.
It's over. There is nothing to do.
Good morning, Nadya.
Well, how do you feel?
I always wanted to know how the doctor felt.
I'm very glad to have a patient.
People around here are too healthy.
You like your baby?
Oh, she's very ugly, like her father.
And beautiful.
Olga!
Commander Petrov of the
12th Border Cavalry speaking to the border villages.
The fascist armies of the German Reich invaded the Soviet
Union this morning.
I will repeat.
German armies crossed the border of the Soviet Union this morning.
The attack was made with unprecedented fury.
But our land will be defended with a fury the fascist armies have never known.
To the border villages, salute, comrades.
The war has come.
Comrades, we have good reason to know that our country is at war.
In our small village alone,
30 people have been injured.
Eleven people have been killed.
But this is not a time for mourning.
It is time for revenge.
We will divide into two groups, each to do his duty from this day until death.
The able-bodied men are to come forward to the right of this building.
We will move from the village to the hills and take our position as guerrillas.
I will go immediately to Comrade Commander
Petrov's Garrison to get the guns.
The second group has the hardest job.
They must stay behind.
As guerrillas, we must have aid and information.
As villagers, you must, before the entrance of the Germans, destroy everything.
Everything, comrades.
The houses you have built, the crops you have sowed with your hands, the cattle you have raised.
The Germans are not more than 50 miles away.
Yours is the dangerous job.
For this job, you will volunteer.
It is you who may have to live with the...
...the Germans.
"I, who am about to become a guerrilla fighter of the Soviet Union, I take this solemn oath."
I, who am about to become a guerrilla fighter of the Soviet Union, I take this solemn oath.
"I will not lay down these arms until the last fascist is driven from our land."
I will not lay down these arms until the last fascist is driven from our land.
"I am willing to give my life, to die in battle to keep my people from fascist slavery."
I am willing to give my life, to die in battle to keep my people from fascist slavery.
You know where we'll be.
One of us will come every night to the pine grove.
Remember, we'll need supplies and information.
This is our land, our village!
We remember we fought another war to make them ours.
We swear to give our lives if they be needed.
We swear!

I'm ready, Comrade Petrov.
Good. Now, just a moment.
These reports show the
Germans rapidly advancing across our territory.
By nightfall, there won't be a highway free of their guns, their tanks, and their supply trucks, all going to the front.
Remember, you have a good 40 miles to travel.
Your best chance is to take to the back road.
That'll take too long.
I'll have to take a chance on the highway.
We need that ammunition bad and quick.
I'll get the truck through.
You can count on it.
Good.
Comrade Karp is going to take my place.
My duty is to report to the nearest airfield.
So gather around, listen closely, and I'll show you what I think is your only chance to get back to the village.
The Germans must have crossed the river at the upper bend, and -- get down, everybody!
Father!
Kolya.
Damian.
Get the guns out.
Save the guns.
Get them out.
Get these boxes out!
Did you do it?
Yes, Father.
They're safe.
For our men.
Take it to them.
They're... They're at the end of the stream.
Other side,
Obmyk Hill...
Beyond the pinewoods, past...
Take it back to them.
You hear me?
Yes, Father. We'll take it back.
Say hello to... To your mother for me.
I promise.
Well, that's all of it.
I'll say goodbye now.
Travel at night and stick to the woods.
When you get to the upper crossroads, you'll see a little -- but what about you?
You said the Germans had crossed the river.
How can you get to the airfield?
I'll get through all right.
Now, do your best.
Don't be frightened.
Fear is a bad enemy -- or so people have told me.
Bye, Clavdia.
Goodbye, Kolya.
Marina.
We'll do the best we can.
That's all.
Tell Mother that...
Grisha.
Goodbye, Kolya.
Look after them, Karp.
Twenty-five years ago, we fought and died for this earth.
People go forward.
They fight for themselves and make things better for themselves -- more food, a good bed, jokes to make and time to laugh.
Then the filthy come and try to stop it.
They want to take away from people all the good they've made for themselves.
Well... Then you take your gun and you fight until you've killed all such.
Ready, comrades?
Yes, comrade.
We're ready.
We are ordered to occupy the North Star village.
How big is this village?
Not big.
We're only taking
125 men to hold it.
We are ordered to establish a regimental field hospital in the village
North Star ahead.
Field hospital and a village dispensary.
How can I take care of all these men and more to come?
The order says that more ambulances and doctors will be sent to us.
I don't want doctors.
I need surgeons.
The colonel has forgotten me.
I am a surgeon.
A surgeon is a man who can operate, Dr. Richter.
I have not forgotten you.
Dr. Richter, where did you take your medical training?
Freiburg, as I have told the colonel many times before.
That was a good school.
I must beg the colonel's pardon.
With respect to the colonel's superior rank and reputation,
I must beg the colonel's pardon to -- do not beg my pardon so often, Dr. Richter.
Good manners do not make a good surgeon.
It's well known, of course, the colonel studied at the
University of Leipzig.
In the great days.
I was a pupil of freidenthal.
His most famous pupil.
Freidenthal? The Jew?
Yes. Freidenthal the Jew.
The colonel did not mind his being a Jew?
Mind?
I never thought about it in those days.
It must be pleasant to be so sure of oneself.
I should like to think I was as good as the colonel thinks he is.
The day you think you're as good as I am, Dr. Richter,
I will know that you're suffering from delusions of grandeur and I shall commit you to an asylum.
Trust me, Dr. Richter.
Burn your houses! The
Germans are coming!
Burn your houses! The
Germans are coming!
It's hard. The hardest part.
The hardest part.
Go and do it now.
Others give their lives. We give what is life to us.
Look.
Another burning village.
Speed up. Speed up.
Quite different, isn't it, Dr. Richter?
The Army of the Third Reich didn't see burning villages on its pleasant tour through Western Europe.
This amuses the colonel?
No. Danger doesn't amuse me.
I only state facts.
A strong people. One has always heard that.
A hard people to conquer.
Silence!
Who is responsible for the burning and destruction in this village?
Where are the younger men?
They burned it and have tried to escape.
Is that correct?
Has the hospital been burned down?
It is not bad. We caught it.
Carry in the casualties immediately and get the operative cases ready.
As you order, colonel.
The chairman of the Soviet of this collective farm is called... Rodion Pavlov.
Is he here?
Where is his family?
I wish these questions answered!
You have already, by the burning of this village, shown yourselves to be enemies of the German army.
We punish our enemies...
Severely.
Where is the wife of Rodion Pavlov?
I am the wife of
Rodion Pavlov.
Come forward.
I wish to know where your husband is hiding, how many men he has with him and how much ammunition.
Yes?
I cannot answer those questions.
You are certain that you will not answer?
I am certain.
Take her inside.
Swine. Swine!
I am a doctor.
They will bring her out.
Her right arm and her right leg will be broken.
You should advise your people to give information when it is asked for.
You are a doctor and you are able to -- in this new order of ours, we have to countenance and commit many acts one does not necessarily approve of.
Shh.
We'll have a look.
We'll join you at the crossroads.
Wait.
Take Clavdia and grisha and hitch the horses.
I can shoot. Do what I tell you.
If anything goes wrong, then -- well, drive away.
Don't wait. Just drive.
The horses. Quick.
Hitch the horses.
Frightened?
I...
Yes.
Good.
Only fools aren't frightened when there's something to be frightened about.
And I don't like to see a fool hold a gun.
Now, go on.
And remember -- you'll only have a second to fire and you must be quick and sure.
Try to sleep.
I'll watch.
Planes?
It's hard to tell.
You get some sleep, my dear.
Everything sounds like planes to me.
I think of Damian and the children...
Wherever they are.
And Kolya.
You are quiet for you.
I haven't had any sleep for 30 hours.
I've been on four bombing trips today.
You're my fifth.
How did you do?
Well, I always do well.
I got two planes...
Whole line of supplies.
Got some big guns near the river.
Well, get ready to do it again.
We'll be over them in three minutes.
We'll see how good you are.
Oh, I'm good.
You must have heard about me.
First flight, son?
This is my first flight in the war, Grandaddy.
I was at home on leave.
Well, don't get shaky about it.
I'll bring you through all right.
He talks that way.
I've been flying with him for years.
I'm used to it.
I can blow those supply trucks.
What do you say?
Save your bombs.
This will make a good strafing job.
We're going down.
Tanks. Tanks in those trees ahead.
Pilot, are you all right?
Are you all right?!
Gunner, they got the pilot.
Come forward at once.
Sir.
Where did you get it?
Are you bad?
I don't know.
I can't feel it.
Remember -- years ago in training?
They said when you couldn't feel it, it was bad!
That's not true. That's all talk. You hold on.
We'll go over the road and let go what we got left, and I'll have on the ground in 10 minutes.
We're badly clipped in the back.
It's worse than I thought.
You crawl to the back.
I'll let you know when to bail out.
No, never. Never been frightened, I mean.
Maybe there's something the matter with me.
All right. Crawl back now.
If you can't open the hatch, I'll do it for you.
If the plane's too bad to land,
I'm gonna try something else.
And it doesn't need more than one man to do it.
Now, don't argue and sound brave and be a nuisance.
I can do it alone.
Get ready to jump!
Well, you'd never have made it anyway.
I'll get ready for it.
This is going to be for my father and for me and for my village and for people I've never seen.
Those are big words.
I guess I'll have to stand by them now.
I'm coming down, and it's going to hurt you!
And I'm coming down just where I want to because I was a good bombardier and a good pilot, too!
The children were given their supper at the hospital tonight.
Good. They needed it.
It was a good supper
I saw it
Why did they do that?
There's been nothing but bad bread.
What? What, Anna?
The children are still at the hospital -- in the hall, on the benches where I saw them.
Supper was over long ago.
Shh. Shh.
What?
Sasha.
Shh.
He says we are to stay here.
He says we --
Mischa and Sonya went in there and...
Forceps.
Gauze.
No. Don't do that.
No. Don't do that.
Rag.
Orderly!
Guard! Guard!
Guard!
Take this man out. Put him under arrest.
Do not be so nervous,
Captain Richter.
You are well guarded in this room from the feeble attacks of an old man.
Dismissed!
After you, Dr. Kurin.
I realize that this is difficult for you to understand.
But our plasma supply was insufficient, so we have to take blood for our wounded where we can get it and where the donor is easiest to control.
I was looking at your hospital library today.
I had forgotten that Kurin the pathologist was Russian.
Strange to find you in this little village.
You came to the University of
Leipzig to read your paper.
Must have been...
30 years ago.
I was a student, of course, and not allowed to hear you.
But I remember it.
Cigarette?
They said that men of medicine see all that can happen to people.
I'm an old man, and
I have seen much.
But how can a doctor bring himself to not only take blood from children but to bleed them white?
Comrade Kurin.
This boy needs help.
May I? Of course.
Dr. Von Harden, do you mean that you're not having this man arrested?
If you wish to be a warrior, Captain Richter, you must take chances with your life.
Dr. Kurin is a famous man of science.
He's not a man who kills and therefore no danger to us.
Halt! Who goes there?
It's me -- Dr. Kurin.
Advance to be recognized!
The Kechins' boy.
You recognize him, comrade.
Take me to Rodion.
Yeah.
Twenty trucks. Now start counting.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Ten seconds. And here they come.
Twenty trucks, then 10 seconds.
Eight motorcycles in 15 seconds.
And more trucks without ammo.
Yes. That's the track.
Karp hasn't seen these hills for 10 years, but he remembered them as if -- we'll go straight through without stopping, and we'll be there.
We'll have done our work.
Yes.
Your face has changed.
And yours.
Tired and hungry.
You read about hunger, but you don't understand how bad it is until it happens to you.
If Karp and I can keep awake, nothing else will matter.
I can do some of the driving.
Not this time.
We'll be climbing.
It'll be hard.
You'll sleep on my shoulder.
That'll make me feel good, sure of myself.
Could I, Marina?
I've never...
Could I?
I'm going through the woods to this side.
As their group of motorcycles come around this turn,
I'm going to fire at them.
That'll stop the column.
You will be ready here.
As the firing starts, you will take the wagons across the road.
The firing will cover the noise, and they'll not be watching for you.
They'll be busy with me.
I hope.
If two people were there to fire, one one side and one another, it'll be a better chance for you.
I'm coming with you.
It's not for us to talk of what's best for one of us.
You're needed to take home the guns.
That's what you must do and what you will do.
When you hear the firing, go across.
When it's over, I'll meet you on the hill by the cow path.
On the hill by the cow path.
He's right, Marina.
It's the only way.
Soon now.
When you hear the firing, go across as fast as you can.
And remember to leave room for me to cross next to you.
Grisha.
Where's Clavdia?
She's gone.
She went after Damian.
I saw her.
Grisha.
Why didn't you -- I must go find her.
You must not go after her.
You must let her alone.
I saw her face.
Oh, Grandpa.
Anna.
Oh, somebody help me.
Make me do something right, the way everybody else does.
Keep me from being so frightened.
Keep me from crying, please.
Where are you hit?
Bad?
There are only two -- don't go, Marina. Wait a few more minutes.
A dead kid and a fat girl.
All right. Signal to them to go on.
The dangerous enemy has been dealt with.
I'm going.
Stay here.
Blind.
Clavdia?
Come on. We just have time.
Is it bad?
No wounds on him.
Clavdia.
It's me -- Marina.
And Karp.
Clavdia.
Cla-- where is she?
Clavdia.
She's dead.
Clavdia.
Marina?
Yes?
Where are we?
Over the Yunageno Hills.
How much longer?
Not much more.
What time is it?
About 5:00.
In the morning or -- or in the afternoon?
All right! All right!
You say Boris has not come with the guns, but they are your children, and they're being bled to death!
Why, the whole village will be -- our time has come to fight.
It does no good for me to lie.
Men with rocks and clubs are not good against machine guns.
Now, there will be five men to a gun.
You know it, and I'll say it.
This may be the last time we ride down a hill.
What do you say?
All right. Saddle your horses.
Take up your watch at the pine grove.
And when Boris gets here with the guns, rush him down to the north cornfield.
Pray that he arrives in time.
All right. The selected men, dismount.
The rest of you wait here until you see the gas aflame, and then ride to the schoolyard and ride fast.
Barricade it soon as you get in.
You know the plan.
Each group knows what to do.
Now let's do it.
All right. Now for the gasoline.
Let's keep it pouring.
Down! We are fighting in the village!
I'll take you!
They're our men!
They've come to fight.
Sophia, Nadya, our children are home!
The children!
Nadya!
Grisha.
Anna!
My baby is home!
Damian, it's your mother.
Damian!
Mama.
Mama.
Grandpa!
Gran--
I have come for another visit, Dr. Von Harden.
I'll only be a minute, doctor.
Sulfanilamide.
Come in, Dr. Kurin.
You do not like Dr. Richter.
I do not like incompetent doctors.
I do not like much of what I have done for the past nine years.
You do not like bleeding children to their death?
The boy died?
You knew he would die!
They took too much blood.
I am sorry for that.
Yes, I believe you when you tell me you're sorry.
I'm sorry for many things, Dr. Kurin.
Most sorry that it isn't the world we used to know.
I have heard about men like you -- civilized men who are sorry.
This?
This kind is nothing.
They will go when their bosses go.
But men like you, who have contempt for men like him -- to me, you are the real filth.
Men who do the work of fascists while they pretend to themselves that they are better than the beasts for whom they work.
Men who do murder while they laugh at those who order them to do it.
It is men like you who have sold their people to men like him.
You see, Dr. Von Harden, you were wrong about many things.
I am a man who kills.
You, uh, feel you'll need this thing, huh?
I like it.
We will come home someday.
I want to sew again.
And you will want to write your book again.
We are not so old.
They tell me you were very brave, Grandpa.
And why not, child?
I'm of the same blood as you and Clavdia.
It's gone.
There will be another someday.
Yes.
It will be different for us.
Wars don't leave people as they were.
All people will learn this and come to see that wars do not have to be.
We'll make this the last war.
We'll make a free world for all men.
The Earth belongs to us, the people, if we fight for it.
And we will fight for it!
♪ Our forest, our river ♪
♪ We'll fight for land and home ♪
♪ Our land we'll deliver back to its own ♪
♪ A dream we cherish ♪
♪ And never perish ♪
♪ And we'll be free men once more ♪
Fairpath. Calling Operations Room.
M for Mother landed 04:26.
No sign of any other aircraft about.
Still no sign of B for Bertie. Over.
Hello, Group.
Yes, they're all back now, except B for Bertie.
From this and other operations,
one of our aircraft is missing.
Pilot speaking, pilot speaking.
Testing intercoms.
Tom Earnshaw, second pilot.
Frank Shelley, observer.
Bob Ashley, wireless op.
Geoff Hickman, front gunner, all correct.
George Corbett, rear gunner.
- That's all, Corbett.
- Thank you, sir.
Group, sir, about tonight's operations.
Reynolds speaking. Yes. Right.
The target is Stuttgart, the Mercedes-Benz works.
Will all operational crews
report to briefing at 1 4:30. 1 4:30.
- Mail. One for you, Skipper.
- Thank you.
- One for you, Tom. Nice Halifax postmark.
- Some letter.
Halifax again.
- Oh, it's from my fiancée.
- Both of them? Have you got two?
The other's from Dad.
- Surely not the future Mrs Earnshaw?
- Whittaker & Whittaker, her dad's firm.
- Second best in Yorkshire.
- We know whose the best are.
- My dad's.
- Earnshaw & Son.
Mm. l'm dying to see those two noble animals in the same meadow.
You won't have to wait long.
Here comes Corbett, singing and dancing as usual.
(Airman) Billiards after lunch?
- You coming on this party tonight?
- l'm on ops.
Hazel says don't forget tomorrow night.
(Both) Hazel Mason, home and forces programme.
9:40. George, what are you doing tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow? Packing.
- No, you're listening to my wife.
Home and Forces Programme.
Pack tonight. l'm flying tonight.
- We didn't know you were on ops.
- l saw the group captain.
As it's my last night, he agreed to let me go.
Sorry to have gone over your head.
That's all right. Glad to have you with us.
Eh, fellas?
We're honoured, Sir George. l suppose Hopkins has been told about this switch.
- l suppose so.
- l'd like to see Hopkins' face, Frank.
Poor old Hopkins.
(American accent) Well, the son of a gun.
- Hopkins.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, but you won't be wanted tonight.
- l see, sir.
- Bad luck, old man.
The son of a gun. l don't believe it. Hey, he's pulling my leg. lf you're not going, can l have your silk stockings?
Oh, l suppose so.
What's this, camouflage net?
That's quality if it's a pair.
They keep you warm as toast. lf my girl ever finds out l lent...
Tell her Bob Ashley wore them.
She'll be pleased as punch.
Boy, l wish you could have
seen that run of Welsh's,
a run worthy of
the great Bob Ashley himself.
lt had all the earmarks of an Ashley special.
So it's a free kick against the Allied Forces.
Free kick. Now, look out for Welsh.
Not Welsh.
Not Welsh? Hear that, Len? l'd like to see anybody else take it.
Course it'll be Welsh.
Compton will take the kick.
This is a tense moment. The ball is
on the spot. Welsh is going to kick.
What did l say?
Welsh is going to take the kick.
Come on, Welsh!
Welsh has kicked. No, he hasn't.
He's jumped over the ball.
Compton's taking the kick.
Compton's the man.
Goal! Well shot, Compton!
Well, that was a surprise.
Not to me.
Cope with this indicator. lt's stuck again.
- l'll fix it.
- How's Bertie?
Perfect, sir. New coat, full stomach, a gent.
Fine. Bring the car back about four.
Did they fix that oil pressure, Jimmy?
Yes, it's OK now.
- Who's this bloke?
- Fan of yours, wants your autograph.
- Saw you in some play.
- That's right. l saw you in the School For Scandal.
You played Joseph Surface.
Got a pencil?
- Afraid not.
- l'll do it for you tomorrow.
- Thanks.
- lt was Charles Surface.
Fairpath calling T for Tommy, T for Tommy. lt's now 21 :35, 21 :35. You may take off.
Checking intercoms. Bob, are you there?
Sergeant Ashley, sir, receiving you all right.
Blasted beehive gets smaller every trip.
What are you grumbling about, Sir George?
You've got a carriage to yourself.
Fairpath calling.
Q for Queenie, Q for Queenie.
21 :37, 21 :37. You may take off now.
Check your watches, chaps. ln 50 seconds, it'll be 21 :40. ln...45 seconds. ln...40 seconds.
Fairpath calling B for Bertie, B for Bertie. lt is now 21 :40, 21 :40.
Off you go.
Geoff, OK to go forward.
OK, Skipper.
Stuttgart, here we come.
You know, l played in Stuttgart with my club in er...1938.
1938...l was playing in New York.
- What's Stuttgart like?
- Oh, like all those continental towns.
Played Saturday, Sunday,
Monday on the train.
That was Stuttgart. Well, well.
- Nice girls in Stuttgart, Skipper.
- Well, one anyway.
What do you know about the girls in Stuttgart? l know a nurse from Stuttgart.
That's funny. Mine was a nurse.
Was her name Liesel?
No, Else. What was your nurse like?
Oh, she was a big blonde job.
Couldn't half cook too.
She worked for a doctor in Gerrards Cross.
Used to sing that song, er...l Kiss Your Little Hand Madame.
That's right and, of course, she used to sing it in German, you know?
She was always singing it, l suppose, cos
she wasn't allowed to sing it in Germany.
The composer was a Jew, l believe.
What was your nurse like, Skipper?
Else? She was blonde too.
- Was she a good cook?
- She was good at everything.
My next nurse wasn't so good.
You seem to specialise in nurses, Skipper.
Well, l did then. l was only two, you see.
- Had you there.
- l'd seen snaps of her in my father's album.
He was on the reparations commission.
Stuttgart was capital of Württemberg, once a kingdom on its own.
That's right. The biggest paper there is called the Württemberger Zeitung.
Liesel used to read it to me out loud.
Over Dutch coast.
Geoff, George, look out for fighters. lf my course is right, we'll be getting some flak soon.
Your course seems all right, Frank.
- Cologne's just come off the air.
- l don't blame her.
Railroad ahead.
Got it. Main line to Cologne. l've travelled on that line and l was going to Stuttgart.
Mannheim on our right.
Tom, give them some leaflets.
Okey-doke.
Give them the Ashley special. lt's good for you.
Hold the course, John, over River Neckar.
John, do you see what l see?
Big fire, dead ahead.
We're in the wrong end, John.
- Can l have a smack at the searchlight?
- OK, give it a squirt or two.
Can l have a go too, Skipper?
No favouritism.
OK.
Now who's in the wrong end?
What's that fire?
Bet that's Queenie on the job.
And that'll be Tommy.
All right, do another circuit.
Bomb doors.
Bomb doors open.
- OK, let's go down.
- Going down.
Level out.
Steady.
Left, left.
Steady.
All bombs gone.
Shall l transmit, sir, mission completed?
Crikey!
How about it, Tom?
Starboard engine's packed up.
Port's all right.
Hello, Bob. lntercoms working?
Yes, sir, radio's dead though.
George, everything organised?
- You may get your hands full.
- All right, Skipper.
We'll sort 'em out, won't we, George?
How about it, Bob?
Completely cheese, sir, all tubes blown.
- How about cut out the corners, Frank?
- All set. Shortest route over Mainz.
Alter course to 301 , Johnny.
Bob, destroy your code signals. l have, sir. They taste filthy.
Speed still dropping, only 90 now. l'll try a steep dive. Hang on, everybody. lt's no use, chaps.
We'll have to stooge home on one engine.
At this rate, she may stall any minute.
- Shall l get out and push?
- Where are we, Frank?
Over Holland. Amersfoot.
Can you see a railroad? l'm not sure. How about you, Tom?
Yes, l think so.
That's the main line from Amersfoot to Hilversum.
Blast! That's both engines packed up now.
We'll have to jump for it, boys.
- Geoff. George.
- (Both) Sir.
- Frank. Bob. Tom.
- OK.
- l'm here.
- Stand by to abandon aircraft.
Shall we chance it together or go solo?
- Together.
- How?
Bail out along the railroad,
Skipper's last to leave. lf we all follow the railroad northwest, we're bound to find each other.
Tom, jump.
Frank, jump.
Geoff, jump.
George, jump.
Bob, jump.
- (George) What can you see?
- The Zuider Zee.
Anything else?
Windmills.
Any soldiers?
- No.
- What's the country like? Can you see far?
Yes, miles. Very flat.
What did you expect, the mountains of Mourne?
No sign of him, then?
The Zuider Zee's no good to us.
How far is it to the North Sea?
- About 38 miles.
- That's not so bad.
- lt's 38 miles too far in this make-up.
- Clothes are the first thing to organise.
- Then there's Bob.
- lt's too bad about Bob.
- l'd rather it'd been John or Frank.
- Oh, would you?
- No offence.
- Anyone got a cigarette? l haven't. You have lived abroad, Skipper, and they reckon Frank's a first-class actor.
Sorry, last one.
A football pro is used to travelling with his team. Bob'll get lost on his own.
Let's face it. He is lost.
We want to watch things like that.
And we'd better keep down too.
Bob might turn up here.
Well, he's three hours overdue.
Got a match?
We've wasted enough time already.
John, you command in the air.
You should command on the ground.
Why should anyone command?
Let's all have a say.
- That won't work.
- l take John's view.
Very well. What do you suggest?
Well...the first thing we've got to do is to find Bob, obviously.
We can't let him down.
And then... Well, then we make a plan of campaign.
Decide what to do and what not to do.
- Don't you agree, Tom?
- Hm.
Then er...well, act accordingly.
Very explicit.
Clear as mud.
- Here, come on down.
- l must say, Frank...
Now, listen, l've been lost dozens of times.
Sometimes alone, sometimes with a regiment, so l know this much, either we separate here and now and it's each man for himself, or we stick together and somebody must command.
- Who's for separating?
- What are you for yourself? l'll put another question.
Do we surrender or do we try and get back home?
- Well, what do you think?
- Frank, you're navigator. Where are we? l'd say somewhere...somewhere here.
There's Hilversum to the west,
Amsterdam and the Zuider Zee up there.
Now, we want to aim at a spot somewhere south of Haarlem, between Zandvoort and Katwijk... but there's several main roads and it's swarming with people.
- What's ''polder'' mean?
- Land that's reclaimed. Dykes and dams. lt's nearly all polder country south of Haarlem. Tulip fields.
Pity about that, l like a nice tulip.
What are we going to do about our clothes?
We've got to get into civvies somehow.
Well, what's George doing?
- Going swimming in the canal.
- How do you know there is one?
There's always a canal in Holland. The next best thing to civilian clothes is to have none. l'll be a swimming Dutchman and spy out the land.
- Suppose you meet a Dutchman.
- l'll use gestures.
- Suppose it's a girl.
- Can you speak Dutch?
- No.
- Well, l can.
- Well?
- Well enough. Diplomat's Dutch. l think you're going to be the swimming Dutchman, my lad.
Shh. Somebody coming, l think.
Vicky! Vicky!
Vicky! Vicky!
Vicky! Vicky!
That dog spots us, we're jiggered.
(Girl) Willem! Willem!
(All) Vicky!
- (Barks)
- Lie down. Get!
Shut up. Shut up.
- (Continues barking)
- Vicky! Vicky!
Willem! Willem!
Maartie! Vicky!
Vicky! Vicky!
- (All) Vicky!
- (Barking)
Niet...afraid...zijn. Niet rennen weg. lk vrienden. Engels.
RAF. R-A-F.
R-A-F. R-A-F.
Royal Air Force!
Ja. Royal Air Force. Ben jij een vriend?
Allebjij vrienden.
- He says they're friends.
- Let's go and talk to them. l hope they don't scram.
He asked if we've come to invade Holland.
(Laughs) What with?
Hello.
Hello, young fella.
We jumped out of our aeroplane.
Bailed out.
One, two, three, four... five, six allez.
Six disparu.
- That's French.
- Well?
Johnny, over to you, over.
(Speaks haltingly) Er... Verloren...lost, een cameraad, hier ergens.
Heb je hem niet gezien?
Hoe... Your names?
Willem, Maartie.
- Jannie.
- Hendrik.
Jan.
Tom.
Geoff.
Frank. George.
- Ja. lk begrijp.
- What's this safety pin gag? lt's a sign against Germans and quislings.
A safety pin means keep together.
Keep your mouth shut.
There's someone at the farm who speaks English. Her name is Els...
Els...Els Meertens. Els Meertens.
Els Meertens.
- Zij is schooljuffrouw.
- She's a schoolmarm.
Sounds a useful old bird. ls dit invasie van Holland?
No, young fellow, we have not come to invade Holland...yet. l know that much Dutch already.
Kind of a debate going on in there, l think.
Miss Meertens. l'll never put a ferret down a rabbit hole again, l know that. lt's quite stuffy in here, as if it might be a trap. l'm not so sure it isn't.
Must be 20 of them, talking for half an hour.
What about? That's what l'd like to know.
Fetching Germans. l wouldn't put it past 'em.
- l would.
- You would? Why? l've been watching the road ever since we got here.
No one's left the house.
Shh.
Sorry, gentlemen, to have kept you waiting. l am Els Meertens, schoolteacher from Emmen.
How do you do, Miss Meertens?
My name is John Glyn Haggard and these...
The identities of all five of you are of the greatest importance to us but if you don't mind, we prefer to check them for ourselves.
Excuse me, Miss Meertens, how do you propose to find out if we don't tell you? l see you wear an identity bracelet. l'm sure you can tell me your friend's name.
Well? Can you or can't you?
- Of course. l've known him a long time.
- l didn't ask how long you had known him.
What is his name?
He's Mr Tom Earnshaw, our second pilot, of course.
Right.
- You jumped out of your aeroplane, why?
- We didn't want to crash with it.
- Where did it crash?
- lt didn't.
- The engine picked up after we bailed out.
- l don't know very much about aeroplanes.
But that means you can't prove your aircraft has crashed. lt might have gone on for miles.
Would it surprise you to know that so far as is known no aircraft has crashed in West Holland during the night? l suppose Bertie could have reached the sea.
- What do you say, John?
- Don't ask me. Your witness.
- Where are your parachutes?
- We buried them.
- All five?
- Five are all we know about.
- What do you mean by that?
- There were six in my crew.
You are captain?
Yes.
- Where is the sixth man?
- l don't know. We never found him. l see. And where did you bury your parachutes?
- Look here, l've had enough of...
- You don't know?
Of course l know.
Along the railroad where we landed.
Can any of you prove beyond reasonable doubt that you are what you say you are? l'll be jiggered. l've never heard such a thing.
- But our uniforms...
- Prove nothing.
- Why not?
- Anybody could get a uniform. lf some people were anxious to find out how we were to behave towards English airmen, wouldn't that be the simplest way?
You mean you think we've come here to get you to give yourselves away?
But we're English. We wouldn't do a thing like that, would we, Frank?
You're not so sure about the others?
What are you trying to make me say?
Of course l'm sure.
What is the name of this gentleman?
- Go on, George.
- This is Frank Shelley. He's an actor.
And his wife is to broadcast tonight.
(All) 9:40, home and forces programme.
Frank, contrary to mess regulations, l saw you tearing a piece out of the Times.
You got it on you? l think that's the sort of proof
Miss Meertens wants.
Here you are.
''Broadcasting, home and forces programme, Sunday 9:40...''
That's tonight.
''Hazel Mason...'' That's my wife.
There's the date and there's the date on the newspaper.
Yes, this is yesterday's Times.
Your witness.
Does that satisfy you, Miss Meertens? lt will do, l think. l'm going to show it to the others.
You're not the only one that had their doubts.
Not the only one?
No, there's nothing to stop you sending for the Nazis. l thought airmen had better eyesight than that.
- What a girl.
- As you say.
- She shot you down in flames.
- What did she mean about our eyesight?
- Something we missed in this room.
- Let's find it.
- Orange blossom.
- What's orange blossom got do with it?
That's their Oranje altar, Orange altar, to honour Queen Wilhemina.
(Geoff) But why Orange?
(Tom) William of Orange, the House of Orange, shows they're loyal.
There should be a picture of the queen too.
There is.
Quite foxy. That Els Meertens, what a girl.
- We heard you the first time.
- Gentlemen, won't you come in?
Thank you.
Pieter Sluys, your host, gentlemen.
Come on, John. l always thought speeches came at the end of a meal.
Wouldn't mind a little bit of that ham anyway.
- (Els) Won't you sit down, please?
- Thank you.
This is very good of you but aren't you short of food?
Sometimes but don't worry, we have enough for our friends.
He says, ''Don't worry, eat him.
He was a quisling pig.''
- Thank you.
- Erg lekker.
Thank you.
Gesundheit.
Very nice.
We are worried about your comrade who is lost.
So are we, miss.
Bob's brains are in his feet.
- ln his feet?
- Bob's a football player. A very good one.
But not very bright.
Still it's a pity his brains are not in his head. lf he's found, the Germans are going to look for you five.
Burying the parachutes was a mistake.
Freshly-dug earth will be examined.
- Can't we send someone to dig them up?
- We have.
And we will hide them, this time in a safer place.
You know, young lady, you've got your head screwed on.
Thank you.
The main thing is your escape.
- Any ideas?
- You agree that we can escape?
Others have done it. Why not you?
First we must get to the sea.
The sea is 58 kilometres away and every village has its German post and every road is patrolled.
- First we must get you to church.
- Why church?
Our church is ten kilometres west of here.
Ten kilometres nearer the North Sea.
You must go at once.
Excuse me, Miss Meertens, what is your church?
We are Catholics. l'm chapel.
So am l.
What is chapel?
- lndependent Methodist.
- Baptist.
Those are your English Reform churches?
That's it.
(Els) But it's our only plan. lf this gets back to Halifax, l shall never hear the last of it.
We will dress you in Dutch clothes.
Nobody will know.
(Tom) You don't know chapel folk.
But surely your escape is the most important thing.
End justifies the means, Tom.
That's settled. Would it be safer to travel at night? We'd be at the coast in three days.
By our plan, you will be at the coast tonight.
Jo will be waiting for you.
Jo? Who's Jo?
Jo de Vries, the wife of Hendrik de Vries.
Oh? Who's Hendrik de Vries?
Hendrik de Vries was killed by the British in the mass air attacks on Haarlem.
Since then his wife hates the British more than anything in the world.
A very good choice for a hostess.
What is this, a conundrum?
- l never heard that we bombed Haarlem.
- The Germans want us to believe it.
So Jo de Vries obliges them.
They like her because they believe she hates the British.
That is what she wants, so everyone is happy.
Oh, l see, a bit of camouflage.
Yes. We have our own ways of managing things. Did you hear our motto?
No? lt means the sea's a common enemy and against a common enemy one must unite.
Do you think we Hollanders who threw the sea out of our country will let the Germans have it?
Better the sea.
- (Speaks Dutch)
- Can you all ride a bicycle?
Well, l'm not much of a hand at a bike myself. l never was.
We will find a way but first we must find you all clothes.
Better keep our uniforms on, gives us a chance if we're caught.
(Els) You can wear your disguises over them. lf we're going to be pushing off, l would like more ham, Mother.
Ham, natuurlijk.
Talking of ham, Frank, this is your big chance. What disguise will you wear?
You're going to see a series of perfect
Dutch character sketches, real little cameos but er...what do we do for boots?
Klompen.
- Klompen?
- Clogs.
Ah, clogs. l should like to see you walk up
Halifax High Street in a pair of these, Tom.
The old Yorkshire saying,
''From clogs to clogs in three generations.'' l never hoped to co-star with the great
Francis Shelley in a Dutch epic.
Now, George, you're doing quite well, really, quite well, but...co-star? Really. l haven't been to church since my wedding.
- You must have acted in church scenes.
- l did once.
- lt was a spy story and we all got shot.
- That can happen here too.
- How am l doing?
- Quite well.
For a beginner.
Noisy beggars, aren't they? l wonder why he's in such a tearing hurry for on a Sunday morning.
Probably going on leave.
Anything wrong?
Germans found one of your parachutes.
But you dug them up. l thought they were safe.
They are. Very safe.
Then it must be another one.
George.
The Jerries have found another parachute. lt must be Bob's.
- Found Bob's parachute.
- Bob's parachute's found.
That means Bob's safe.
- Not so good for us.
- lt's us the armoured cars are looking for.
Els says they're searching villages in the neighbourhood.
So long as they don't find our parachutes, we're safe.
- Where are they hidden?
- Where are they hidden?
Where are they hidden?
She says that they're quite safe and they're with us in here.
Shh.
Parachutes.
Our national anthem.
Cornelis, my young brother, always in trouble.
Same in England. Same everywhere. l've got a young brother, you know.
Regular little devil.
English boys not as bad as Dutch.
You see the school?
German military post, 20 soldiers.
Boys love to tease the sentries.
They line up on the wall and sing,
''Eenie meanie, minie, mo,
''catch a German by his toe...''
Cornelis? What's he doing at the post?
What he doing at post?
De Jong is a quisling. l am ashamed to speak so of a man of my village but it is true.
He is a traitor, paid by the Nazis.
He is always trying to persuade us to fraternise with the soldiers at the post and now he has sent them gramophone records to play.
And my son has carried them! My son!
We are all trying to bore them to death and my son carries them gramophone records and from that traitor de Jong!
No dinner for Cornelis. Father says he must not go to the football match.
Poor Cornelis, he loves the football.
All week he's been so excited. l think something very... how do you say...buried?
- Dug in?
- More than meets the eye.
Ja. Very good.
More than meets Father's eye.
Poor Cornelis, he very bad but very cute.
He has more than meets the eye.
- (Speaks Dutch)
- (Telephone)
Oh.
A quarter gelder...paid that quisling by the stinking Germans. lt's what my son pockets for helping to entertain German soldiers.
Get out of the way!
Do you speak English?
- Yes.
- Then don't shout.
- You wouldn't dare to keep me here.
- Dare? Huh, you're kept.
You, you, all of you, you're British airmen, the men we're looking for.
- You're risking your head.
- lt's nothing to do with him.
- He'll be shot before he can prove it.
- Talking of shooting...
You wouldn't dare fire here.
Wouldn't we?
(Distant gramophone plays
Dutch national anthem)
The Wilhelmus...our anthem. lt comes from the post, from the Nazis.
- What is it, the radio?
- Sounds more like a gramophone to me.
(Jet van Dieren) lt is a gramophone!
(Jet) Father, isn't it strange?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Perhaps it's not so strange. l don't understand.
Yes, but l do. Your German friends at the post asked you to send them some gramophone records, didn't they?
And you chose my son for the honour of carrying them, didn't you?
And you gave him a quarter for doing it, didn't you?
Ah. My son... Well, he changed all your records for ours and he chose some good ones too, trust him.
All records of our national anthem.
All different labels, foxtrots, tangos, all pasted on so the Germans wouldn't know what they were.
Oh, your friends will like you now, won't they, quisling?
(National anthem plays and shouting in German)
(All) De Jong!
They won't think it's me. Why should they?
Why shouldn't they? lf l was a German, l'd say,
''De Jong sent records.
He didn't bring them himself.
''They turned out to be the Dutch anthem.
Very funny joke. Let's look for de Jong.''
And there they go, looking, with fixed bayonets.
Your move, mah jong.
- They'll believe me if l tell the truth.
- You'll be shot before you can prove it.
- Shot? They can't shoot me.
- Can and will.
Well, it really doesn't matter. Either we shoot you now, or they shoot you later.
Shot? l won't be shot!
Father...help me! Tell me what to do! They'll be after me if they don't find me at home.
Evidently you know your friends. You don't think they'll believe you if you tell the truth.
They believe everyone wants to kill them.
They will shoot first and ask questions afterwards.
You are a servant of God!
You can't let them kill me!
You expect God to help you escape but l think you were meant to fall into our hands.
Achtung! Achtung!
- What's he say?
- What's Jerry say?
''The authorities of occupation have to the number 200 of the crowd limited.
''50 must the football field at once leave.''
A fine cheek, ordering other people about.
What will the people do, Mr Burgomaster?
- What would you do in your own country?
- Tell 'em to go to hell.
- That would cause trouble.
- lt would that.
- Many people might be killed or injured.
- On both sides. ln Holland, we've found a new system. lf 50 are ordered to go, we all go.
Come along.
- That's playing their game.
- You don't understand Germans.
They have orderly minds. lf they say 50, they mean 50.
Achtung! Achtung!
''As you were, it is equally forbidden that everybody should leave.
''Cancel the previous order and continue to enjoy the game, please.''
Jerry seems a bit flustered.
Now we get on with the football.
There you are, you see? Dead easy.
Bob Ashley.
There's Bob!
- lt is Bob!
- Well, l'll be jiggered.
Hurray! What's he Dutch for hurray?
- Hurrah.
- (All) Hurrah!
You strolled around with your hands in your pockets speaking English and pushing men in canals.
- They shouldn't have got in a flap.
- You left your parachute in a canal. lt was time to get cracking. l came back later but l couldn't find it.
- The Germans had it by then.
- Did they? l don't understand how you could walk along without Geoff spotting you.
- l don't either. Perhaps he was asleep.
- (Geoff) l certainly wasn't.
Did you see a train about 6:30?
Oh, yes, sir, it overtook me. l hid.
Overtook you?
You were walking the wrong way, my lad, walking into Germany instead of England.
- Then you met a shepherd.
- Whose dog bit you.
Then they took me to the village where the schoolteacher spoke English.
- Schoolteacher? What was she like?
- OK. That's where l had me breakfast.
And then they passed you along by barge and ox cart...
- Bicycle.
- And what have you.
..until you find yourself on the way to a football match.
And they said, ''Good gracious''.
They told me a truck would take me after the game to some man called Joe...
Not Joe, Jo. lt's a woman, not a man, otherwise you're all right.
Her name is Jo de Vries.
Half a minute.
- l smell the sea.
- The North Sea.
- Hear that?
- German.
- How do you know?
- Heard 'em often enough in the last war.
Hope Mrs de Vries has her weather eye open. lch bin ein Chauffeur von Jo de Vries.
Said tomorrow's dinner would be held up if he didn't let us get through.
- Would that be Mrs de Vries?
- Suppose so.
(Jo) Are you there?
- Englishmen, are you there?
- Yes, all six of us.
When the truck stops, the driver will open up, get out at once.
- Which way?
- There.
She's getting the Jerries to unload the truck for her.
- She's a cool customer.
- These Dutch girls are wizard.
They are. Our girls would do just the same if they had the chance.
(Singing ends, men chat and laugh in German)
(Jo whispers) We're passing over the quarters of 200 German soldiers.
Louis?
We're over my house. lt's the German headquarters.
My rooms are at the end of the wing.
All of you, in the other room.
Take it easy.
You are safe here.
This place has good walls and floors.
You can talk as much as you want to and you can take off those things.
There's a radio here. lt's tuned in to the BBC.
Use it if you like.
Only don't start dancing.
Just below here is the officers' mess. l must leave you now. Got to go back the way we came and come in by the front door, or they might start thinking.
Lock the door behind me and only open it to this knock.
- V.
- Yes, V.
Pity, isn't it? l never felt more like dancing in my life.
Just imagine, officers' mess below,
Jerries all over the place and no dancing.
Such charming partners too.
- What time is it?
Pity. We've missed the news.
- What time did you you say it was?
- Hazel!
- Who?
(All) Hazel Mason, home and forces programme.
Oh, your wife. l thought l recognised the voice.
Steady, steady.
Not so fast.
That's better.
She's good.
She's damned good. l hope your wife won't object to us undressing during her big scene.
- lf she knew where you were, she'd twitter.
- Shh.
- All over.
- How was she?
Not bad. Not at all bad.
Yes...very good. l hadn't thought about it till now but we'll have been posted missing this morning.
- l had thought of it.
- l don't think the others have.
All the better for them. l suppose Hazel knows about Frank by now.
Bound to. They'd get her at the BBC.
She's on tonight.
Where do you expect her to be, off?
Good blackout they got here.
You know, that's funny, them blacking out because of us.
- l suppose we do fly over here, eh, Frank?
- Katwijk? Yes, often. lt feels like the end of a long term with a cheap supporting cast.
No good looking in there for small change, my boy.
You know, that's very significant.
Five of these woollens are German to one British.
Might be something in that after the war.
Yorkshire woollens in Holland, they might go for it in a big way.
Don't let anybody know l said so. l don't promise. l never talk about anything but woollens. Can't cure myself.
- What's funny about woollens?
- All right, don't get excited.
Which should the world know more about,
British actors or British cloth?
Now, let me see you all.
- Frau de Vries, may l introduce...
- No, you may not. l shall forget your names anyway.
- Well, you don't mind us thanking you?
- No.
Why did you do that? l don't know. l was thinking of my own wife.
- lt wasn't only you.
- l see.
- Were you a diplomat before the war?
- No, Johnny's the diplomat.
- l'm just an actor.
- Of course.
No Englishman would kiss a woman's hand, except perhaps an actor.
- Snub or compliment?
- Compliment.
The way you handled those Germans taught me something about acting. lt isn't so difficult.
They're an unhappy people. l would rather be a Dutchman in Holland now than any German soldier.
They want to believe that somebody's their friend and that's the trick.
A dangerous trick for a woman.
You don't seem to think much of women.
Besides l have Louis and Willem.
He was your driver.
They're the only servants left but they won't leave me. l was afraid when l first started, just as a pilot is afraid the first time he goes solo.
Then after a few minutes, when he finds he's still alive, begins to like it.
- Will you do something for me?
- Yes, of course. l want you to go and see my husband when you get back to England.
- Your husband?
- l'm not mad.
He's in London. l'll give you his address.
- But we heard...
- l know. l spread that story myself.
Nobody knows the truth, not even my friends.
But he's alive and in London.
Do you ever hear from him?
Five times a week. He's one of the Dutch announcers of Radio Oranje.
- What...
- Radio Orange.
Oh.
So you see we're two, on both sides of the channel. We're still fighting.
Well, leave it to us.
Can we get cracking tonight?
You may be here for days or hours. lt depends on your air force.
- You can only get away in a raid.
- We want to get back, raid or no raid.
- Look here...
- Are you in command?
- No, he's a Yorkshireman.
- Are you in command?
- No. You are.
- We have to get you back to England.
You won't be the first or the last to leave this house for England.
You'll reach the sea in a fishing boat and the fishing boat by a row boat from the cellar of this house and to the cellar by a back staircase.
The corridor which passes my door leads to that staircase.
The corridor has two features, a sentry...and a glass roof.
- And so?
- lf you were his officer, what orders would you give in an air raid?
Well, tell him not to stand about under a glass roof, l suppose.
Exactly. During a raid, the corridor is left unguarded.
Now, do you understand?
Exactly.
Everything is prepared.
There's nothing to do now but wait.
Owing to bad weather conditions,
there were no operations over
enemy territory last night.
You're telling me.
Mon herr.
Pardon, mon herr.
Our wine has been drunk by the Germans but being a Dutch woman, l think that Dutch water is a better drink than French champagne. l'm sorry l haven't been able to give you the food l would have liked to but we haven't very much left. l mean, not very much left to eat.
But we've kept everything else.
We can think and hope... and fight. l give you a toast. Louis.
Our motto since the house of Orange drove out the Spaniards 300 years ago.
''Je maintiendrai.'' lt's nice to be a woman again, even for half an hour.
What do they reckon that motto of yours means, then, ma'am?
''We can take it.''
Well, l never. 300 years ago. We don't seem to have progressed much, do we?
George.
Come on, George. l don't know why everybody's looking at me.
After all we have a diplomat and an actor here. l suppose it's my age.
Well, my dear young lady, we can't offer you anything except our love... our gratitude and our admiration for a brave woman and a fearless country.
But we can promise you one thing... a growing help, an attack, which will sweep these Germans from...
Air raid!
Come here, all of you.
You see? That's what you're doing for us.
Can you hear them running for shelter?
Can you understand what that means to all the occupied countries, to enslaved people having it drummed into their ears that the Germans are masters of the earth?
Seeing those masters running for shelter, seeing them crouching under tables and hearing that steady hum night after night, that noise which is oil for the burning fire of our hearts.
(Whispers) Stop here.
She's leading him up the garden path beautifully.
- They're expecting another chap, Fritz.
- A little reception committee for Fritzy.
He's gone to get a Korkenzieher. l don't know what Korkenzieher means.
Oh!
(Whispers) She's dropped his torch in the drink.
- Since when did you speak German?
- l can understand that much.
Hello, Fritzy.
OK.
Now, what about this Korkenzieher?
- Of course.
- What is it?
Corkscrew.
Cut it out. l'll be Fritz.
You others follow as soon as the fight starts.
- All right, Mrs de Vries? Tom?
- Yes.
- Kiboshed.
- Bob?
KO.
- Frank? Geoff?
- All correct, sir.
Louis!
You can't wait for the tide to turn or the fishing boat. These three will be missed.
- We can't leave you in a spot like this.
- Don't worry about me.
And don't worry about these Germans.
We didn't invite them to our country but we can take care of them once they're here.
That tunnel leads to the river.
Watch out for a fishing boat coming upstream with two white diamonds on it.
Try and contact the fishermen. lf you can't, trust to luck.
The danger will be at the swing bridge at the mouth of the river. lt's guarded.
You may be challenged.
You must use your own judgment.
Now, hurry.
- What about the course?
- Due west.
Steer by a light you will pick up eight miles out. lt's a German rescue buoy for their airmen who hit the sea.
Keep well to the left of it and watch out for E-boats.
- You have your compass?
- Yes.
Don't waste my corkscrew, bring a bottle.
Well, God bless you. l suppose that's the one advantage of being old.
Good luck.
Stand by. ln.
- Out!
- (Booming)
Swing bridge ahead.
Here come the fishing boats.
Two white diamonds.
Our buoy friends.
Our chance will be when the bridge starts to close again.
Stand by to cast off.
When l give the word, roll.
Get set.
Cast off. ln.
Out. ln.
Quicken up.
Out.
Halt!
Now, row!
(Guard) Halt!
- ln, out, in...
- (Gunshot)
- Keep down.
- We're not going to be caught!
- (Gunshot)
- ln, out...
- ln, out...
- (Heavy machine-gun fire)
- ln, out, in, out...
- (Machine-gun fire continues)
Our luck.
They don't dare use searchlights cos of our chaps.
Let's slow it down. l'm done.
What's your course, George?
We're going a bit north.
Do you want any help, sir?
You all right, George?
George?
- He's hurt.
- Steer, somebody.
- Are you hurt badly, George?
- The tiller...
Oh, don't worry about that.
Here. Geoff.
Here, pass me that sack.
Oh, Lord.
You all right now, George? lf l can stick it till morning, l'll do all right. l suppose this is what they call choppy. lt's what l call nasty.
Hey, here they come.
- They've spotted us, sir.
- Blast.
They'll be here in three minutes.
- lf this comes off, we're going to be all right.
- Shut the hatch.
- Are they still jabbering, sir?
- Yes.
They're ordering these two thugs to sit quiet till E-boats get here.
What are we going to do about
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern?
You two stay put, understand?
You're far too cocky.
You understand that all right.
OK.
No need to have an empty stomach anyway.
Try to pick up something from our side.
Out!
(Man) They don't seem to understand my German, sir.
He's one of us!
All line up!
Steady! Watch it!
- Hello? Air Force?
- That's right, six of us.
What are you birds doing here?
- A wonder Jerry didn't pick you up.
- Matter of fact, we picked up two of them.
Jerries? Are they your prisoners?
We've been arguing about that since we got here.
They were here first and radioed for help. l see their point.
Technically you're their prisoners.
(Geoff) What, six to two? l like that.
Sir.
Got a bit too cocky, so we took their guns.
Legally that weakens your status but don't mind me, l'm a barrister when l'm ashore.
Then we loosened the cables and hoped we'd drift.
You drifted all right. Another hour with this tide and you'd be in our own minefields.
- How long have you been in the pot?
- Since four.
We saw you coming, sir.
We thought you was Jerries, sir.
Trouble with you fellows is you can't see anything unless you're 10,000 feet up.
We heard they were sending E-boats.
- When did you hear?
- Ten minutes ago.
Ten minutes? What are we waiting for?
Get aboard.
One of us is wounded.
We shan't be able to get him across to your boat.
Yes. l quite agree. He can't be moved.
Bit old for a flyer, isn't he?
Well, how do you feel about it?
He's our rear gunner.
Yes...if it wasn't for those E-boats.
Of course, you don't want to leave him. lt would be the wisest thing to do.
We can't do that.
We're all the one crew, you see?
Yes, l quite agree.
- Coxswain!
- Aye, aye, sir!
- Take this lobster pot in tow!
- Aye, aye, sir!
What about the E-boats?
That to the E-boats. Next stop Dover.
- That's all, Corbett.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, George, this is the new kite.
How do you like it?
Yes, that's more my size.
Right. The target's Berlin.
Before 1877, southwest Texas was pouring cattle northward...
...over the newly opened Chisholm Trail.
The Texans of the open range could see wealth and power just ahead.
But this is the year of the great breakup.
The outlaws of the wide open West have learned how easy it is...
...to raid the lonely herds.
In this country, where the ranch houses are 20 miles apart...
...the thieves hit hard and often, stampeding the wild cattle.
Rustlers gather from the length of the frontier for the easy kill...
...and the range is without defense.
Night after night, they drive the cattle off by hundreds that mount into thousands.
And the vast herds are melting away, ruining the men who built Texas.
The outnumbered ranchers have fought back...
...but the savage range war has smashed their leaders...
...and driven them into exile across the Mexican line.
Only a few men like Charlie Bell of San Antonio...
...still keep the banished fighters posted...
...hoping against hope that the great days can be brought back.
Maybe a peace officer.
- I'm Charlie Bell of San Antonio.
- You have pass?
The border is closed, señor.
Is new order.
Look here, you people.
I can go and wade the river a mile below here without any trouble.
But I don't mean to do anything of the kind.
If you try to cross, there is nothing what we can do but try to stop you.
It is not our fault if your law breaks down so your best men come live with us.
We will have peace in Mexico, even if every day we must fight.
Clay Hardin is in Nuevo Laredo and I mean to see him.
Other men have come after him before.
It only means more fight.
I know all that, but I'm Clay Hardin's best friend.
Then you know he is going back to Texas.
You can see him then.
If you wanna save his life, you'd better let me see him now.
- Go on in.
Thanks.
He is gone. He's not here.
We never heard of him.
That horse is the horse of my husband.
Help! Help!
Juan, Jose, Rita, Rosita!
We're attacked. We're stricken.
A bad stranger is upon us.
Looking for someone?
I ought to take that thing and bend it over your head.
Ha, ha. You look like the time you sat on the cactus. How are you?
Ha, ha.
What's the matter with these people?
You could've saved yourself a long ride.
I wrote you I was coming home.
I guess you wrote other people. Everybody knows you're gonna make a try at it.
They do? Well, why burn up horseflesh coming all this way down here to tell me?
Clay, I rode to tell you not to come.
At least not now.
I love you
You're not ready to ride, Clay.
I never see a man shot up so bad as you was.
Be mine
Yahoo!
You think that's why
I stayed in Mexico, huh?
Oh, don't go back, Clay.
It ain't worth it.
All southwest Texas is busted.
San Antonio is just gonna be another dog town all falling down.
You're sweeter than any wine
That's just why I'm going back.
Now, you listen to me, Clay.
We've counted more than 5000 wanted outlaws loose in Texas.
They got a chain of stock thieves all along the border.
Them fellows can run a herd into Mexico every night.
Mexico can't help it, Charlie.
Us neither.
Look at the way we fought them.
You tied into them harder than anybody else. And what did it get us?
Your ranch burned out, your cows run off and yourself all shot to pieces.
Everybody knows who I blame for all that.
Clay, don't you see that's why you'll never get back to San Antonio?
You think Roy Stuart don't know you're after him?
I left Texas to find out something.
I found it. If Roy Stuart thinks
I'm coming after him now, he's right.
He's right about something else too.
The only way you'll get to San Antonio alive is to stay away.
- Can you get a bet on that?
- Anywhere in Texas.
The gamblers are making book in the streets.
Laredo's practically put up a grandstand and sold seats...
...to see you shot as you cross the line.
- Yeah?
Well, cover every cent you can get.
I'll pay it.
Don't run away, honey.
We won't look. Ha. Will we?
Now, listen, things got so bad up there, the governor asked for military aid.
Colonel Johnson's cavalry is policing San Antonio.
And the colonel himself swears he'll outlaw you the day you come back.
Yeah? Charlie?
Roy Stuart has gotta be convicted and hung.
You'll never get him that way, Clay.
I've got him now.
What do you think I've been doing down in Mexico?
We were whipped before because we lacked proof. We don't lack it now.
- Does Stuart know?
- Of course he does.
All the more reason it's sure death to cross over.
What do you want me to do?
Send somebody else?
All right, Clay. What's the next move?
Cross over into Laredo.
Get me seat on the San Antonio stage.
- In whose name?
- In my own name.
- What?
- Sure.
Onyx. He looks good.
How come you haven't lost him in a poker game by now?
Because I don't gamble the way you do.
Oh.
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Charlie.
He wouldn't be here if Clay Hardin didn't aim to go through.
There'll be a fight if he tries to.
- You gonna put into it?
- Not me. But there's plenty as will.
Three-to-one, gents, 3-to-1
Clay Hardin never sets foot in San Antonio.
Place your bets with Honest Jay Witherspoon.
Never run out on a bet yet.
Or at least, with two exceptions, it was never proved.
- Three-to-one Clay never makes it.
- Why should Clay come back?
His cattle is scattered from Stinkwater to breakfast.
- Half his friends is dead, other is foolish.
- It's worse than you say.
But here's 100 that says he will be back.
Another 100 says it will be the best thing that happened to Texas.
Thank you, Mr. Streeter, I can use this.
Any more bets?
Three-to-one. Three-to-one.
Ain't that Lafe McWilliams?
Had all them gunfights in San Antone?
Sure is, brother.
Five-to-one. Make it 8-to-1.
Clay Hardin never makes San Antonio.
Get your money here, boys.
It's 8-to-1 here.
I got the signal.
Clay Hardin has left Nuevo.
- He may be over the Texas line by now.
- Well?
They lost him, he just disappeared.
We should've rode the river like the others.
Clay can't ride the brush 150 miles.
- There must be lead in him yet.
- That's right.
Even if he tried it, the lookouts would get him easy.
They can see a rider 20 miles as he comes through.
The Monterey coach is coming up.
Do you suppose he'd be fool enough...?
No.
Wait. That ain't the Monterey coach.
That's old Jaime Rosas driving.
That's a charter coach from below.
How do you do? How do you do?
- Oh, sit down.
Ha-ha-ha!
I don't sit down. Don't argue with me.
- Always the opposite.
- Oh.
One side. One side or a horn knocked off.
Scatter, you slickers.
No, no, no, go leave, please.
She don't see somebody now.
Nobody is talking to her without they don't see her first.
Now, wait a minute, my fat-headed friend.
Don't you ever take off your hat?
Of course not.
He needs it to shade his eyes.
Go keep an eye on Charlie Bell.
Real desperate character you got there riding with the driver.
That's my desperate manager.
See, I'm looking for a gentleman.
We haven't seen one in a year.
I'm sorry, ladies.
This is for your own protection.
Clay Hardin's on the loose, and he's a dangerous outlaw.
He's liable to smuggle himself through here.
Do you want to look under the pillows?
- Here.
- Hold on, will you?
No, no, no, inside is not.
You must be stay out.
What's that? You are stealing, I hope.
You right away steal those back.
Such thing begins, I don't know.
Please, make more careless.
If I break that, you sue me.
Ah, shut up!
Oh, sit down.
Come here.
Well, what do you want?
Charlie Bell bought a seat on the San Antonio stage for Clay Hardin.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I saw him do it myself.
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.
You'd better do something.
This stage never runs without a shotgun guard, you know that.
Clay's name is down and the company's gotta take him.
I don't gotta ride shotgun.
There's enough graveyard bait in the strongbox without Clay.
And I've got kids to support.
I didn't think them things was jackrabbits.
Maybe you wanna holler for the Army.
- The company reserves the right...
- I'll ride shotgun myself.
There's my bond.
San Antonio stage, get aboard.
It will roll without me.
I'm too young and good-looking for a one-way trip.
I can't do nothing. I just work here.
Even money, gents. Even money against Clay Hardin, and lucky to get it.
I don't see him.
What's the matter, is he afraid to show?
Maybe he invisible-ized himself.
Clay ain't here. He's changed his mind.
That's what he wants us to think.
He's circled the town already.
The stage will pick him up.
We might outrun the stage and wait at Cotulla.
Get into that coach.
You can get Clay easy when he comes out of the brush.
I'll tail the stage, and as you fire, I'll get Charlie Bell.
- What about my saddle?
- Move, or you won't need it anymore.
Here she rips.
Anybody change their mind?
- I'm going along. I'll settle my ticket later.
- Right.
- Go ahead, Charlie.
- Hyah, hyah, hyah!
Whoa!
Yippee! Yippee!
Well, hello.
Move over, honey.
Now, now, after all, Don Quickshot, the show doesn't start till after supper.
Oh, we're gonna have supper too?
Would you like to land on your head or get out peaceably?
Sorry, but I've planned on this ever since you left Monterey.
I don't like the society in those public coaches, do you?
If I scream, a man will come down here with a shotgun. And I'm going to scream.
- Now, wait, Henrietta.
- Let her go ahead.
I'll help you.
Look, look, look!
There goes an empty horse.
This is really for your own protection.
I'm sorry. We've heard that one.
No, on the level.
- There's a desperate character loose.
- And his name is Clay Hardin.
This is monotonous.
Why doesn't one of you Texans bring out a new lie?
One that will astound people.
Honestly now, wouldn't you like to be protected?
Just a little, on one side, huh?
Is it a Western custom to push yourself in on other people?
Yes, ma'am.
That's how the West was settled.
We're not Indians.
Go on, get out of here, scat.
You know,
I saw a poster of you down Mexico way...
...and it didn't half do you justice.
Thank you.
Maybe I do need you to protect me from this Clay Hardin person.
Well, on second thought,
I don't know if I can.
- But I can protect you, ma'am.
- Oh, don't mind me.
I've stood almost everything in the show business, I guess I could stand that.
Then you must be one of those rich cattlemen.
- Are you married?
- Me? Uh-uh.
No. And I haven't got any cattle left.
You see? You was very rude.
He wouldn't marry you anyway.
I wasn't asking for myself.
Well, don't ask him for me either.
You see, out here, we've got a class of men who sort of work in the dark.
Those night raiders got away with just about every cow I own.
I suppose it never occurred to you to put your cows inside at night.
No... Inside?
What on earth is this? Cast iron?
No. Bear jerky.
- Oh.
- That's good.
Do you know what's happening at Delmonico's this minute?
Monico's? Who's he?
He is a famous New York restaurant.
Some actress, not a bit more talented than I am...
...is sitting at a lovely table having lobster and crêpe suzettes...
...and champagne.
Sounds like she's a cinch for the hiccups.
And then every head will turn and watch her as she goes sweeping out.
Oh, she's got the job sweeping out, huh?
- Of course not. She's an actress.
- Oh.
Or, uh, do you know what an actress is?
Oh, sure.
Sure, she's a girl Roy Stuart hires to sing and cut up in his saloon, huh?
Saloon?
Is the Bella Union a saloon?
Well, you wouldn't exactly call it a saloon.
It's more of a drinking joint.
But I have a contract with Roy Stuart.
Why, he's the partner of a man
I worked for in New Orleans, Mr. Legare.
I could never understand why he lets the pigs in there.
They keep running in and out, getting into fights with the dogs. Tsk, tsk.
I won't play there.
I won't even go in the town.
Bozie, you make me so mad, I could cry.
Oh, don't you worry.
Bella Union isn't really that bad.
Mm, ha?
Don't you worry about a thing.
As soon as we start changing horses at Cotulla, I'm gonna take you dancing.
You have a much better chance of dancing with the horses.
Ha, ha. You don't mean that.
Put your little foot
Put your little foot
Put your little foot right out
Put your little foot
Put your little foot
Put your little foot right out
Put your arm around
Put your arm around
Put your arm around my waist
Keep your arm around
Keep your arm around
Keep your arm around my waist
Take a step to the side
Take a step to the rear
Take a step to the side
But forever stay near
Do a little whirl
Do a little whirl
Do a little whirl about
Do a little twirl
Do a little twirl
Do a little twirl about
Walk a little bit
Walk a little bit
Put your little foot right out
Sing a little bit
Sing a little bit
Put your little foot right out
Why, you do this like you were born to it.
Took me years to pick up.
This must be the only thing that took you that long.
Well, we don't see pretty girls like you down here very often.
Ha, ha.
I guess that's why we have to pay for it, huh?
The regular stagecoach stops here overnight.
They don't have to sit up all night bouncing their brains out.
It is not my brains is tired.
Well, use them, then, and get us on the regular stagecoach.
Look, Tuesday, it is last night we played already...
...so we got to be there yesterday yet, because the day before we ain't no place.
- You know?
- What?
Look, next day it is last night we don't start...
...and Tuesday evening is the morning we ain't coming.
- Now you understand?
- Of course not.
I'm sorry, I'm not a teacher. Sheesh.
Hi, Charlie.
Pony Smith was on the stage with me.
Lafe McWilliams tailed us.
I saw them.
They're in the street right this minute.
Public street.
We gotta do something to get you out of this.
- They'll never give you a fair break.
- Did I ask for one?
All right, Clay. It's your carcass.
He called you Clay.
Uh-huh.
- You never told me your name w...
- Well, you never asked me.
- Are you really Clay Hardin?
- Uh-huh.
Well, are they going to arrest you?
I hope not.
Break up our whole evening, wouldn't it?
I'd like this better if Charlie Bell was out of it.
Yeah, I guess you'd like
Clay Hardin out of it too.
I can handle my job.
- Then let's not waste any time.
- Don't worry about me.
Well, Pony, I'll see you in San Antonio.
All right, Lafe.
Thank you.
We get from out now. Maybe?
Well, I think we ought to tie on the nosebag before we get from out now, maybe, huh?
You'll tie on a nosebag, won't you, Jeanne?
Uh, waiter. Two more nosebags, please.
Waiter, I will take one too.
Big size.
This next dance is mine.
I'm sorry, but I'm tired now.
Give us some music, boys.
Don't make me ask loud, lady.
Wait a minute.
I am her management.
She got to have advance billing, or else: Poof.
No wiggles.
Shut up, Bozie.
Surely you heard what the lady said, didn't you, Lafe?
I don't believe I'd horn into this, Hardin.
I've known people to get hurt bad sometimes...
...just by leaving too much slack in their rope.
Uh...
Don't you find it a little crowded in here?
Maybe you'd sooner talk this over in the street.
After you.
Sure.
I think I smell a polecat.
Thanks, Charlie.
What's the matter, Lafe?
Something go wrong?
Did you see that potato draw on me?
He tried to gun me from the side.
Yeah, I saw him, Charlie.
- Charlie.
- Yeah?
Tell you what you do.
Go over to the telegraph office.
Send an overnight wire to Roy Stuart.
Say: "Deal went through as planned. "
You've got a buzzing in your head?
Sign it "Lafe McWilliams. "
Such a business:
Boom, boom, boom.
Just like burying people was no trouble.
Hmm. Heh.
I, uh...
I never thought of it just that way before.
I'm a failure. I don't know how to take care of her in such a madhouse.
If I ever get her back to New York,
I'm gonna have her locked up...
...and spend the rest of my life in some nice, quiet insane asylum.
But you must have known this would happen if you showed yourself here.
Kind of noisy for a minute, wasn't it?
I believe you've been delaying here just to fight those men.
Me? Oh, no.
No, I just like music.
You see Mr. Roy Stuart?
Up in his office.
Five hundred dollars to this Jeanne Starr woman for one week.
Who is she?
Another one of your flea-bitten canaries?
Roy, why don't you leave the artistic end of our business to me?
Because your figures don't tell anything.
The way you run this place, nobody knows where the money goes.
What is this,
New Orleans style or Chinese?
I can't tell you, Roy, how it hurts me to hear you say that.
What a tone of voice to use to your partner. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Did you ever stop to think what would happen to you, Legare...
...if I caught you shorting me?
You might keep the accounts yourself, you know.
That is, if you can add.
For Mr. Roy Stuart.
Think over what I said.
Muchas gracias, Mr. Stuart.
Look at that. This was sent last night.
Took it 20 hours to come from Cotulla.
They must have brought it on foot, walking backwards.
Why can't they?
Lafe McWilliams must have gone crazy.
I told him 50 times never to wire me.
But I can use it.
Some kind of an accident seems to have happened to Clay Hardin.
May I see it?
I don't think you'd be interested.
Your odds are way off kilter.
The Laredo stage has been in for an hour.
And was Clay Hardin on it?
- Nobody was on it except Charlie Bell.
- That's right.
Funny thing, I've taken more bets since the coach came in than I did before.
Ah.
- Still fussing about the odds, boys?
Well, I guess maybe they are a bit tough, at that.
Fifteen-to-one.
That I'd have to take, if I was betting on my own funeral.
- Give them all they want.
- Right.
Get it out, boys. Come on.
Here's a hundred.
- Yes, Mr. Legare?
- I'm very sorry to bother you, Mr. Pratt.
Mr. Stuart just now received a telegram and tore it up by mistake.
I wonder if you possibly have a copy.
- Yes, I think so.
- Ah.
We don't usually do this, you know, but, uh, seeing that you're his partner.
Yes, of course.
Thank you very much.
He'll appreciate this.
Thank you.
It is the lady! She has come.
The lady from Monterey!
See there? We got us a female visitor.
It's Jeanne Starr. In her own coach.
I wish it was Clay Hardin.
Not me. Come on.
Do you mean to tell me this little mud Indian village is San Antonio?
Oh, it is nice. You will like it.
As far as I'm concerned, it's just another place full of wild savages.
Try to look gorgeous.
Remember, hold in your stomach.
Oh, Henrietta.
Hurry up. Get over there.
Here. Stand straight.
Pay attention.
What's the matter with you? Stay here.
Now, listen, boys, if you can't make it good, make it noisy.
Do you understand that?
Good.
Mademoiselle Jeanne.
It is a pleasure to see you again.
Oh, Monsieur Legare, what a lovely reception.
But then, you always arrange these things so beautifully.
My dear, for such beauty as yours, receptions arrange themselves.
Oh, yes.
Miss Starr, this is my partner, Roy Stuart.
Mr. Stuart,
I've heard so much about you.
You're really a very famous man.
Miss Starr, that's the greatest thing that ever happened to San Antonio.
I was just telling Legare how lucky we are...
I said, I was telling Legare...
It's Clay Hardin! He's back.
There's Clay Hardin.
Why, it's Hardin.
It's Clay Hardin.
Clay! Clay Hardin!
Get back there. Get back.
- Better stay back, out of the line of fire.
- This can be anything.
- Here it comes.
- Don't make any play unless Roy does.
You'd better go inside.
How are you, Roy?
Why, you look a little surprised to see me.
So? Why should I be?
I thought maybe you might have heard something.
There was some talk of you coming back.
And vice versa too, I'll bet.
Did you bet on it, Roy?
It don't mean a thing to me.
I've handled you before, remember?
That's why I've come back.
They don't want any more shooting in San Antone.
Colonel Johnson and the cavalry will grab you inside of 15 minutes.
Unless you get smart and save them the trouble.
Roy, that's just what I'm gonna do.
You're gonna do what?
Save them the trouble.
They eased past the killing point.
For this one minute, they have.
Colonel Johnson left town about an hour ago on Army business.
And he won't be back until tomorrow.
But he told me to tell you, if you showed up in San Antonio, he'd run...
Wait a minute, captain.
I haven't come on any personal business.
I came because I've got the evidence...
...on what and who started the whole Beyar County cattle war.
Here it is.
I brought it straight to the colonel.
And give it to him yourself tomorrow.
I don't want it on my hands overnight.
- Who was it?
- Roy Stuart.
I can show what brands were raided, where cattle went, and what Stuart got.
That's no good until it's shown in court.
I know that. All I want is three days.
Give me two days, and I'll prove every charge I ever made against Stuart.
I can't promise you anything, Hardin.
I only work here.
The colonel told me, the first man who starts shooting...
...during their nesting season, we're gonna grab him and jump all over him.
And abuse him in every way we can think of.
Uh...
Who is "we"?
Well, that's what the colonel says.
I'll be back in the morning.
Come on, Charlie.
We'II, uh, be glad to see you, Hardin.
It looks like we got the Army against us too.
He wasn't much help.
I'll tell you what you do.
Get a hold of Tip Brice, Ricardo Torreon, and Cleve Andrews too, if you can find him.
- Bring them up to the hotel.
- Pronto.
Should've bribed him, Charlie.
- Reach for the sky, you!
- Oh, cut it out, Clay, will you?
Clay, I'm glad to see you.
- How are you?
- I'm glad to see you.
Say, Texas ought to make this a holiday.
Horsefeathers.
Come on, light and squat, you Indians.
I got something to say to you.
I want you to listen and listen fast.
What's on your mind?
I sent for you because you were always too dumb to know when you were licked.
All right. Now I want you to back my play just once more.
We're in awful poor shape for any more fighting, Clay.
Cleve, you stand up to Roy Stuart just one more day...
...and I guarantee you by tomorrow night we'll have the state of Texas on our side.
- One day can be a long, long time.
- Show them the tally book, Clay.
Is that what you were after in Mexico?
What did you think he was doing?
Picking flowers?
Just a minute, 500 head of Bar nine.
That's my brand.
I didn't sell those cattle.
It's signed by Roy Stuart.
How did you hook onto this, Clay?
Well, one night we saw a whole herd of cattle stampeding through the Rio.
We tied into them and stampeded them back.
- Get any of the rustlers?
- Uh-huh. One only, one of Roy Stuart's men.
We found his body in the brush by the river.
He had this tally book inside his shirt.
You caught them running my cattle into Mexico?
What do you mean, your cattle?
Everyone had cattle in that herd.
You see how he's worked?
He'd drive those stolen cattle down into Mexico.
Then he'd sell them back into Texas across a thousand miles of border.
Now, get Stuart and Beyar County will come back.
It's no use unless you all get on the witness stand...
...and swear that you never sold these cattle.
I might as well tell you that witness stand's the hottest seat in Texas.
So all the boys should come in.
Notes, notes, music.
If you're gonna rehearse that orchestra, don't you think you'd?
No!
What on earth is that?
- Something usual.
- You never looked like that before.
I want to surprise you.
Oh, Bozie, this is no time for jokes.
This is legal evidence which we never had before.
It amounts to yes or no for southwest Texas.
As long as we've got these bills of sale on our cattle signed by Stuart, we've got him.
- It's about time, Clay.
- All right, now here's our...
Here's our first move.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
You must not go:
"Doodle, doodle, deedle. "
You must go:
"Deedle, deedle, doodle. "
Always the opposite.
I have never seen in my...
Look, look. Upside down, he's got it.
You think the audience is sitting on its head? Turn it.
Now, here it is.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Am I supposed to sing to that?
It is a nice arrangement.
I think of it myself.
It will tear down the dump. You will see.
Oh! I don't suppose it makes any difference whether anybody hears me or not.
Probably some professional horseback rider will come in...
...and everybody will turn their backs on me.
Hey, how about a little quiet in here?
Are you always every place?
- Just keep it quiet, will you, please?
- Oh!
- Better run for it, young man.
Never touched me.
You're getting closer, but I can't wait.
I'll see you tonight in the saloon.
If you had common sense, you'd stay out of that bear's nest tonight.
What are you talking about?
The more lights, the more people, the more peace, you know that.
- I don't know anything of the kind.
- Ahh.
Can you imagine a man wanting to miss that Jeanne Starr? Oh.
Sometimes I worry about you. Come on.
Oh, shut up.
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.
- Take these in to Ms. Starr, will you?
- Right away.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Not for me. I'll be at the bar.
We can keep an eye on everybody that way.
Hello, Ed. Where did you get the parrot?
It's a southern parrot.
It came from Mississippi.
- Ha, ha. Parrots don't come from the South.
- Oh, they don't, eh?
How y'all? Awk!
Fine, thanks.
- You sent for me, Mr. Stuart?
- Oh, not sent, Miss Starr.
I just said whenever it was convenient.
Oh.
- Well, I haven't much time to change.
- Oh, there's no hurry.
They'll hold the curtain for me.
- Shall we have a little drink for luck?
- No, thank you.
I hope you're going to enjoy San Antone.
I'm sure we're going to enjoy you.
After the show, if you'd like...
...I thought we might have a little dinner up here.
It's more private, nobody will disturb us.
No, no, Roy.
Not now, just a friendly call.
I'll tell you when the shooting starts.
What do you want here?
Oh, Miss Jeanne,
Mr. Legare said he'd like to see you.
- He's right next door.
- Thank you.
You'll excuse me, Mr. Stuart?
- I asked you a question.
- I know.
You were asking another when I came in.
Is that your girl?
Could be.
We haven't made up our minds yet.
Come in.
You sent for me, Mr. Legare?
Did I?
Oh, yes, of course.
Please, won't you sit down?
- I should be getting backstage.
- Oh, don't worry, they'll wait for you.
And for me.
You know, my dear...
...I have been looking forward so much to this visit of yours.
Really, like a young boy.
What a pity it was in New Orleans that we didn't see more of each other.
Mm, but now...
Pardon me, I just came in to tell you
Bozie's looking for you, Miss Jeanne.
He's going crazy downstairs.
Thank you, Mr. Hardin.
I really must run now.
Roy, you want us to do something about Clay Hardin?
Not till I tell you.
It's really a pity, Roy...
...that you don't take fuller advantage of my brains.
As I think of it now, I'm afraid you have made another wretched mistake.
Don't talk so much.
I'm thinking now of a very interesting tally book...
...that I accidentally looked into once.
One accident can lead to another, Legare.
As I recall, the book contained some very curious bills of sale...
...transferring cattle.
I write bills of sale everyday.
Yes. But this time you were selling cattle that didn't belong to you, Roy.
I suppose you learned that by accident too.
Did it never occur to you that some of the people who work for you...
...may also be friends of mine?
I've always suspected it.
That's how I know that this tally book...
...this convicting evidence against you...
...has fallen into the hands of someone else.
Don't you know what's going to happen if you don't get it back?
You'd like to get a hold of it yourself, wouldn't you? Ha-ha-ha.
I wonder who has that book of yours now.
I suppose it might be someone sitting at one of those tables.
It might even be someone standing at that bar.
I suppose one man's guess is as good as another's, isn't it?
Now, don't step on your dress and trip and spoil your number.
I think I'll send Clay Hardin a note and thank him for his flowers.
Now, hold still. You look like a rag doll.
Jeanne, if you follow my advice, you let that fellow alone.
He was born for trouble.
Gentlemen, tonight is a night you will never forget.
I hasten to present Jeanne Starr.
I'm so happy, oh, so happy
And why shouldn't I be?
There's a reason
And the reason is as simple as ABC
Some Sunday morning
Is going to be
Some Sunday morning
For someone and me
Bells will be chiming an old melody
Specially for someone
And me
There'll be an organ playing,
Friends and relations will stare
Say, can't you hear them saying
"Gee, what a peach of a pair"
Some Sunday morning
We'll walk down the aisle
He'll be so nervous
And I'll try to smile
Things sure look rosy
For someone and me
Some Sunday morning you'll see
Have you ever gazed at the silvery moon
Hanging low in a Texas sky?
And looked out across the plains
While the breeze hummed a tune
To the tumbleweed tumbling by?
Have you ever walked
By the old Rio Grande?
Have you ever seen sage all in bloom?
Have you felt the delight
Of just roaming around
Way out there
Where there's plenty of room?
Or did you ever ride down
An old cattle trail
While the stars like a million eyes
Seem to look down and say
"When you're down Texas way,
You're really in paradise"
Some Sunday morning
We'll walk down the aisle
He'll be so nervous
And I'll try to smile
Things sure look rosy
For someone and me
We're waiting patiently
To see how heavenly
Some Sunday morning
Can be
Some Sunday morning
There's going to be
Some Sunday morning
For someone and me
Bells will be chiming an old melody
Specially for someone and me
I got a note from the gal to Clay Hardin.
What will I do with it?
Friends and relations will stare
Say, can't you hear them saying
"Gee, what a peach of a pair"
- Give it to him.
- Lf that's the way you want it, boss.
Some Sunday morning
We'll walk down the aisle
He'll be so nervous and I'll try to smile
- Get that drunken cat off the bar.
- Yeah, he is a little drunk, isn't he?
For someone and me
From Miss Starr.
Some Sunday morning
You'll see
Some Sunday morning
Wait a minute, Clay. Don't go back there.
You can't trust anybody in San Antonio tonight.
- This girl's a complete stranger.
- Yeah?
Who brought her here?
Who's she working for?
- Stuart and Legare.
- You didn't always scare this easy.
Oh, all right, go on.
At least let me carry the tally book while you're dilly-dallying.
- You got no right to risk everything.
- Ha, ha.
- Sure, if it will make you any happier, here.
- Careful.
There'll be an organ playing
You're like a ticklish girl at a strawberry festival. Here.
Say, can't you hear them saying
"Gee, what a peach of a pair"
Fair and lovely
Some Sunday morning
We'll walk down the aisle
He'll be so nervous
And I'll try to smile
Henrietta, will you please open the door to the gallery?
It is open.
We're waiting patiently
To see how heavenly...
Well, don't stand there like a ninny.
Come in and shut the door.
This is nice. I'm so glad you came up.
Now, don't talk all night.
You need your rest, you know.
It was sweet of you to send me those flowers you picked yourself.
- Well, I can see you needed them.
- Ha, ha.
And, uh, I'm sorry
I threw those things at you this afternoon.
Oh, that's all right.
Usually, you have to stand in line to throw things at me.
Oh.
It's stifling in here, Clay.
- Let's go out on the gallery.
- Sure.
What's out on that gallery, the pay window?
I feel sorry for the rest of the country.
Struggling along in plain and fancy ignorance.
Poor Louisiana, poor old Arkansas.
What's the matter?
Is Texas going to take them in?
Just think of all the other towns there are.
And only San Antonio rates a performance by Miss Jeanne Starr.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
Where does a cowboy learn to talk like that?
And then to the south of our little house...
...nothing but mile upon mile of button-hole bushes.
They're lovely.
I guess I'm supposed to sew on all the buttons.
Why, of course. Oh, I can see it all.
Birds singing in the trees, flowers coming up.
Oh, yes, and here's the main event:
The whole thing's completely surrounded by millions of assorted cattle.
Oh, that really settles it.
Your old cows scare me to pieces with those long antlers or whatever they are.
Antlers?
So you can't get away from it, Jeannie.
Everything either begins in Texas or ends up there.
That's just it.
Who wants to end up?
Well, if that was a Texas kiss, I...
Maybe I shouldn't have broken up those two meetings you had.
Get inside.
Tell me, Bozic.
What do you see?
L... I don't think I see nobody.
Just remember that.
And remember this:
Nothing was ever more important in your life.
The whole play went wrong.
There'll be guns talking all over the place in another 24 hours.
Joey, you ride to Hondo.
Ride to Sabinal if you have to, and get Harkness' bunch.
Rebel, you swing out to Pilgrim.
Bring in the High-Five and the Jingle-Bob outfits.
You others fetch in your own.
I want the wild bunch in San Antonio by tomorrow night.
The cavalry's still here, Roy.
Pretty tough mixing with that outfit.
If you'd sooner hang...
...I'll see you get the prettiest flowers ever thrown on a corpse.
Come on, boys.
Break out of it.
On your feet. He's coming right in.
- Yeah?
- Get your boys and ride into San Antone.
Roy Stuart wants a hundred gunfighters by sundown tomorrow.
- What for?
- Never mind what for, just get in there.
Well, Stuart's got a lot of brass, that's all I got to say.
Okay, I'll tell him that.
No, wait a minute.
Tell him we'll come in.
I'm sorry to have to continue pressing these questions, Miss Starr...
...but I think you understand the importance of your testimony in this inquiry.
- I'll do anything I can to help.
- Yes, I'm sure you will.
How close were you to Clay Hardin when he was fired on?
Quite...
Quite close.
- This was outside your dressing room.
- We were standing on the gallery.
Someone shot at Mr. Hardin out of the dark.
It broke the window behind us...
...but no one told me to have him stand there.
No one made any suggestion about it.
I swear they didn't, no one.
Tut, tut, tut. Nobody said they did.
That was your own bring-up entirely.
- Don't you believe me?
Yes, yes.
Did you see anyone on the patio?
No, sir.
I don't know anything else.
That's all, Miss Starr.
Thank you very much.
Uh, who is this Sacha Bozic or Beezic or something?
Bozic, Bozic, Bozic.
B- O-Z, zic, Bozic.
- That's me, Your Highness.
- Don't call me that.
Yes, please.
Now, you don't have to give any answers incriminating yourself...
...but where were you when this hurrah broke loose?
I...
I... Please, I was breathing air.
- What?
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I mean, I come outside the dump from inside...
...because there is no air inside the dump.
And I think maybe there is air outside, so I am outside now.
Oh, never mind the climate.
What did you see outside the dump?
Ha, ha. I mean, the Bella Union?
I see nothings. It is so dark.
You can't see nothings.
Great catfish, man.
You just admitted you were there.
- Yes, Excellency.
- Don't call me that either.
- Yes, please.
- Go on.
All of a... All of a...
All of a click, the gun start to go shoot.
I run one way... No, I run two ways.
I try to go someplace else...
...then I come to this man who lies down.
I make a look.
- He's dead.
- Who else did you see?
A- After that...
It is after that a lot of people comes out...
...and helps me look at the deceased.
He's still dead.
- Is that all the light you have to shed?
- Yes, please, that is all I shed.
Well, we found out a sum total of nothing.
Thank you, Your Highness.
We haven't heard anything to prove that Mr. Stuart was in his office...
...as he says he was, the time the killing took place.
I think I can dig up a few witnesses to that.
If someone has shown a reason why I should.
No one has.
It would be much more to the point, Hardin...
...to produce one witness who knows he was not where he says.
There's gotta be some connection.
Otherwise, he's innocent.
You ought to know that.
I know all that, colonel.
I'm sorry we can't get better results here.
Especially since I have to call your attention to our bulletin of this morning.
The military aid we've been giving here is withdrawn.
Stopped, pulled out from under, as of at once.
I don't like to leave in the face of a blowup...
But I've been ordered to go put the quietus on an Indian whittle whang.
My cavalry will leave tonight.
You people are on your own, and heaven help you.
In that case, colonel, there's something I'd like to ask.
If you're pulling out, you gotta leave a peace officer here.
The post of town marshal is vacant.
I think I'm the man to fill it.
- Why?
- I'll tell you why if you want.
I was raised by Charlie Bell, ever since
I was about 2-and-a-half feet high.
When I was a kid,
Indians were playing up bad.
He'd have to take me out and hide me in the brush.
I wouldn't be alive except for Charlie, and he wouldn't be dead except for me.
You give me the authority, and I'll get you the man that killed him.
All right, I'll appoint you for 24 hours only.
By that time, a new marshal...
...can be designated in the regular way.
So that's how long you've got to get...
...the killer in a legal manner.
- I'll try to see that it's long enough.
What's happened to that Starr woman?
How can you speak of her marvelous attraction as "that woman"?
Where's her manager?
Hasn't been around since the inquiry.
Well, it's about time you were asking me that.
He's probably shut in his room, but I advise you to go and see.
You advise me?
Didn't you gather that Bozic was wandering around outside our dump, as he calls it...
...at the time you were shooting up these people?
- I shot nobody.
- Yes, yes, of course not.
Stick to it, by all means.
I got no more notion of who shot this infernal Charlie Bell than you have.
But you were having a little gun spree in the patio, weren't you?
That's a great plenty to hang you, you know?
Yet you just casually let an eyewitness go kicking around...
...without the least precaution.
- Who's taking care of him?
- Nobody, Roy.
Nobody at all.
Then you don't know whether he's still in that room or not.
No, I don't.
For all we know, he is wandering all over the place...
...talking freely to all kinds of people.
Don't you ever take care of anything yourself anymore?
Jeanne. Jeanne.
- Feeling better, Bozic?
- I feel... I feel terrible.
- Terrible.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He always feels terrible.
- But never like this.
If he feels like he's dying, there's beginning to be justice around here.
You are a heartless old wrinkle.
Always the opposite.
- Come on, Jeanne.
- No, Jeanne, I must speak to you.
- We haven't time to hear...
- No, no, no, only Jeannie, please.
Go ahead, I'll be with you in a moment.
If he tells you he's run us out of money again, don't be surprised.
What's the matter, Bozie?
Jeanne, a terrible thing make itself to happen next.
- Wait a minute.
- It is true, I don't know how to tell myself.
Jeanne, it is a murder wants to happen and I'm it.
Oh, for goodness' sake, Bozie.
Now, tell me. What is it?
It is so necessary nobody can help.
I don't hope.
You see, I... I know... I...
I know who was the murderer who kills Charlie Bell.
- Who was it?
- I can't tell you, I don't dare tell you.
- You should have told them at the inquiry.
- Yes, I know, but then I could not think.
And now it is too late.
He has people helping him.
They are all around us.
They are in the patio, in the stairs.
- Well, what do you want to do?
- We must try to get away, get away.
Maybe they will let us go when they see we are just quietly going from out.
Oh, Bozie. I can't go.
I...
- You would just wait for them to kill me?
- No.
But, well, you can get out of here a whole lot better without me.
Now, grab what you need and get away from here this very minute.
No, no, I could not leave you alone.
If you don't, I'll march straight to Clay Hardin with the whole thing.
No, you mustn't, you mustn't.
It's the worst you could do.
Then you would be in danger too.
Well, then, get out of here.
Don't argue with me.
Please hurry up.
All right, Jeanne, if you want me to.
- Jeanne...
- Bozie, go on.
Aah!
I can't do it. I can't leave.
You can't do what?
I can't...
Mr. Stuart.
I understand that you're known to roam around some at night.
L... I didn't mean to. I was only breathing air.
You were behind the Bella Union when Bell died, weren't you?
You don't need to say it.
Don't, please. Don't.
I wouldn't tell on Mr. Legare.
I wou...
You wouldn't tell on who?
L... I didn't mean to see him.
I didn't know Mr. Legare was there.
I...
I was just running away.
You saw Legare shoot Bell?
No, no.
I swear I don't tell somebody.
Shut up.
Yes, please.
I never thought he had that kind of gravel in his craw.
And you'll be out of town in 15 minutes?
Fifteen minutes. Yes.
Make it 10 minutes.
Ten minutes.
Ten minutes. Ten...
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
Where's Legare?
He's eating, down in the middle of the plaza.
Keep a close lookout on Clay Hardin.
I like to know where he is.
Right.
Jackson.
Worried, Legare?
Well, I was just thinking of borrowing some of your artillery.
As we say in New Orleans:
What does that mean in Texas?
The same thing, Roy.
"There is no one who isn't dangerous for someone. "
The Bozic matter is taken care of, naturally.
He's out of reach.
Including your reach, Legare.
I have no objection to your killing Charlie Bell.
Probably saved me the trouble.
Without actually admitting anything...
...let me say I am happy that you take that view.
But, uh, wouldn't it be strange...
...if I were to find that the tally book is in your hands now?
Ha, ha. Considering that it might easily hang you, I might say yes.
Wouldn't that be odd?
I have thought for some time, Roy, that you need me as a partner...
...in your cattle business.
As well as in the Bella Union.
So you do have the tally book?
I can be a great help to you, Roy.
At the present moment, you are perhaps the most feared man in South Texas.
You're certainly the richest.
You will still be one of the richest if we divide it all.
Can you think of one good reason why I don't kill you?
I can.
You don't know where your tally book is.
Or where it will turn up if I die.
You not only will not kill me, Roy...
...you will defend my life as if it were your own.
It almost works, Legare.
Oh, I think it will.
Every time you look at me, Roy, you must say to yourself:
"There sits my very life and about $ 10 million. "
You think you're smart, don't you?
You are smart.
But not smart enough.
Sure, now it's too early, and later, it will be too late.
Mr. Hardin, Mr. Clay, that lady,
Jeanne Starr, she wanna see you.
Gracias, hombre. Take it.
- I tell her something?
- No, nothing.
Something's happened and we don't know about it.
Unless we can find out before the cavalry leaves...
...it's no use finding out at all.
We can't fight until the cavalry leaves and after that, we can't win.
Roy Stuart's mavericks are piling into town, hand over fist.
That wild bunch could have gone into town last night.
I wonder why they didn't.
Because you did not tell them to,
I suppose.
I wonder why Stuart didn't need them until after Charlie Bell was dead.
If he hadn't killed Charlie Bell,
Texas would have blowed up in his face.
Ah. He's still afraid of that.
You know something, Tip?
I don't think Stuart killed Charlie.
He's dead, ain't he?
Someone else killed him and took that tally book.
- I don't think Stuart knows where it is.
- But then, neither do we.
Someone does.
I've got an idea who it is.
- Go find me Sacha Bozic.
- Sack of what?
Bozic, you know, Jeanne Starr's manager.
A little round fellow like a beer barrel.
- Go ahead, quick.
- All right.
Excuse me, Miss Jeanne.
I'm looking for your Mister...
You know, the little fellow that handles your freight for you.
Oh, Bozic? I think he...
Uh, I don't know where he is.
Miss Jeanne, uh, Clay Hardin is right out there in the plaza.
Jeanne.
Have you talked to Bozic?
Yes, I see that you have.
How does it seem to be in love with San Antonio's leading crack-shot?
Yes, Clay Hardin.
When there are 200 men in the room, you see only him.
I have noticed it.
Do you realize that you yourself are likely to put Clay Hardin in the greatest danger?
I understand Clay Hardin is very good at taking care of himself.
Hmm. Look about you.
How many guns are in this plaza and behind those shutters?
If a man receives 30 bullets in his body in the 10th part of a second...
...what is his next step in taking care of himself?
What kind of people are you here?
Peace-loving people.
But so many would love to see Clay make a wrong move.
It would be too bad if you told him something...
...that would occasion a sudden accident.
I don't need to talk to him at all.
I won't even speak to him.
You will talk to him if it's unavoidable.
But do not seek him out, because if you do,
I'll know I've made a mistake.
I'll be forced to correct it.
Are you sure you ought to be out here by yourself?
The last time we spoke, I think you were accusing me of trying to kill you.
Or of helping someone who wanted to kill you.
What was it you wanted to tell me?
Nothing.
This town is full of men who look as if they'd step on baby chickens.
Is that all you wanted to say?
Or are you sure Legare didn't just give you some new instructions?
Clay, will you take me away from San Antonio?
Right now, this very minute?
You know what that building is over there?
What, that old broken church?
- You ever hear of the Alamo?
- Of course, everyone has, but...
- That's it.
- Clay, will you listen to me, please?
- No, you listen to me.
Texas was born inside those walls.
Those old-time Texans died for something pretty important.
I wouldn't want them to know I pulled out just because it got rough.
- It's hopeless to talk to you, isn't it?
- No.
All you have to do is to be honest just for a minute.
What is it you haven't told me?
Nothing. I swear there's nothing.
If I tell you I believe you, will you stand on that?
- Yes.
Oh, Clay.
Oh, excuse me, miss.
Bozic isn't around here.
He isn't even in town.
Some say he pulled out for Austin by special coach.
Send Bud and Windy after him on the best horses you've got.
Get him back here fast.
- We didn't know he was so important as...
- You know it now, andale.
How did you know that Bozic...?
Who told you?
You did.
You haven't played enough poker.
I guess that ends it, Clay.
There go our troops.
Well, they had to go sometime.
If only Bud and Windy had got back.
They didn't, though.
We couldn't fight them till we had a legal reason.
Now we can't fight at all.
Well, I'll be seeing you, boys.
- Wait, Clay, we'd better go with you.
- Not this time.
What are you gonna do, Clay?
There's always one more drink left in the jug.
I wonder what he meant by that.
Aren't you ever going to forgive me for something I didn't even do?
Uh, did you ever hear of an animal called a Judas goat?
- No, but never mind that now, Clay.
- But I do mind now.
When sheep are driven to be slaughtered, they balk and won't go in.
So a goat is put in to lead them.
- I don't care anything about that.
- I do.
Sheep trust the goat.
They go where she leads.
The goat walks through untouched, but the sheep following are killed.
Is that what you believe of me?
Clay.
Funny part of it is,
Charlie Bell warned me.
If I had listened, he'd be alive tonight.
Wouldn't he?
I wish I'd run away when Bozic did.
Excuse me, Mr. Hardin.
It's time for you to take the stage, my dear.
All right, I'll go.
I hope you have no objection, Mr. Hardin.
Should I have?
Why, of course not.
I know you won't believe me.
But I'm worried about Bozic.
He still isn't here, hasn't even been heard from.
Well, I have to go on anyway.
You know something about this you're not telling me.
You think because I scold Bozie,
I don't care what happens to him.
Well, I scold you too, and I've stuck to you through whistle stops and high water.
I think that's my cue.
You're not ready to go on.
Oh, let me get it over with, Henrietta.
- There's no time.
- There is time.
The orchestra will ad-lib.
I wish you'd look at yourself.
Sit down, Roy.
I don't think you came here just to sit around and scratch fleas.
That's right.
I came to make an arrest.
Clay, as it so happens,
I didn't kill Charlie Bell.
I know that, Roy.
Then what do you want?
I want the man who did.
Secondly, I want an end to raiding in Beyar County.
I know only one way to get that.
But there's another way to get the man who killed Charlie.
Let's watch the show, huh?
That day I crossed the border
He tossed a glance and I lost my heart
Somewhere in Monterey
In broken Spanish
I spoke in Spanish
Love is a Spanish art
So we had lots to say
And then sighing, "hasta mañana"
He ran away
Back to his hacienda
His wife and 10 little chicodees
Somewhere in Monterey
Enjoying the act?
Once, for about five minutes...
...that one girl could have straightened this whole thing out.
Maybe.
But she can't get you out of it now.
Hmm? What's that?
I'll make a deal with you.
Drop all charges against me, give me full immunity...
...I'll give you the man who killed Charlie Bell.
When I've got him, I've also got you.
You know that, don't you?
I know my tally book of cattle sales was taken from Charlie's body.
But if you had it again, you could blow up half this state.
Right.
That's why you've got no chance of making a deal with me.
Then that's also why you haven't got a chance of getting the killer.
Because I'll have to stop you.
That day she crossed the border
He tossed a glance and she lost her heart
Roy, for a moment,
I almost thought you could do it.
I'll see you later.
She spoke in Spanish
Love is a Spanish art
So they had lots to say
Well, what's out there? Bill collectors?
You may as well tell me so I can deal with them.
We've gotta get out of here.
Go back to the hotel.
Hire a coach and put our stuff into it.
- Where are we going?
- I don't even know.
And 10 little chicodees
Somewhere in Monterey
Good evening.
Nope.
Come here.
It comes to me that I have been wrong.
I haven't said anything.
Nothing's happened.
Something has happened.
You have done what I expressly forbade you to do.
- What harm can it...?
- I believe I warned you not to seek him out.
I'll leave San Antonio if you want me to.
I'll get out of here tonight.
I'm afraid it's a little late for that.
Drop your hand.
I got a friend here to see you.
Come in, Bozic.
L... I run away, but I came back.
You're under arrest, Legare, for the murder of Charlie Bell.
I think you'll find it isn't as easy as that.
Don't move.
In about 10 minutes, my job will be done.
May I point out that your next 10 minutes are infinitely uncertain?
Roy Stuart and I detest each other, as you may know.
Yet he has become extremely valuable to me...
...so that I would defend him at the risk of my life.
I'm sure you would.
Conversely, Roy Stuart has a very special reason for valuing me.
Believe me, there hasn't been one moment since you entered the Bella Union...
...when you could have left the building without my help.
I expect to have your help.
You're gonna walk ahead of me until I get outside.
Not too fast and not too slow.
Shall we start?
Not that way.
We're gonna walk through the Bella Union.
Look out, Clay!
Behind you, Clay.
You never were smart enough to be my partner, Legare.
I...
I have been waiting for you, Roy.
Don't move, Stuart.
Drop that gun.
No, no, no.
The big one must go under, so it won't be on top.
That is why the big one is smaller.
Give a push up so it don't stick in so far out.
Sheesh, shoosh.
Always the opposite.
Bozic.
Yes, darling, what can I do for you?
There must have been some answer.
No, Jeanne. No answer is from.
Well, didn't he even say anything to the boy who took my note to him?
The boy don't know where is Clay Hardin, so I send him to look where he ain't...
...to see if he is back.
I don't see the boy since after.
Now, go inside, please, before you change my mind some more.
Maybe Clay never got your note at all.
We got to get her out of this terrible town.
If you can't say nothing, don't speak.
If she can't get her mind off that rider, there's no sense in taking her 200 miles.
She'd only turn around and come back.
I'd do the same thing myself.
Jeanne, if you feel so bad, we don't go someplace.
We don't leave until after we all get killed yet.
If that is what you want. Ah.
No, Bozie. We're leaving now.
If he can't even walk across the plaza to say goodbye to me...
...I don't want to see him again or think of him or hear his name.
Now we pack.
Quick, quick, quick.
Begin putting the stuff on the...
Huh?
Gee. You...
I was very happy to meet you.
Thank you. See you again.
It was very nice. Thank you.
You've searched the Alamo again since daylight?
There was only one body in the Alamo.
The body of Legare.
Nobody knows what happened in there.
Oh, we'll know more about it when we find Clay.
- Lf we find him.
- Yeah.
Aye.
Move over, honey.
Look, look, look.
There goes an empty horse.
You look like they drug you through in an irrigation project, backwards.
He looks as though they completely killed him.
- Just where do you think you're going?
- Out of Texas, you can bet on that.
- How can you even think of leaving Texas?
- Well, I...
Can't you see the sad look in the eyes of those poor little cattle out there?
Look at them.
- You mean, that Matagorda knot-head?
- Yeah. Huh?
Matagorda?
Now, just a minute.
Since when did Easterners start talking about Matagordas?
Well, I... I guess I just wasn't thinking. L...
I'll say you weren't.
I always thought there was something phony about you.
Now, are you going to tell me the truth?
Just where were you born and raised, huh?
Fort Worth.
A Texan, I thought so.
I could have gotten away with it if I'd really tried.
You let go of her, Clay Hardin.
We're going to New Orleans alone.
No, ma'am, we're not.
There is only one place for us Texans.
Amigo, turn around.
- Always the opposite.
- Ha, ha! That's right.

Ding!
Where's Ryan?
You see Wedge?
I can't hear you!
Hi, Wedge!
Ryan!
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's quite all right. Excuse me.
Bob!
Oh, I am sorry.
Let's not make this a habit.
The lady's difficult.
Excuse me.
Bob!
Sorry, you can't come through here.
It's all right, I'm Connie Chesley,
Inter-Ocean news service.
Pleased to meet you. I'm Ben
Hedburg. So what, cookie?
It's all right, Coxswain.
You can let her through.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
Connie.
How are you?
I'm just wonderful, darling.
And you?
Good.
Mr. Collins.
Howdy, Wedge.
Rollie.
Hi, ya, Wedge.
Yump, how are ya?
Glad to see ya, Brick.
Hans, good to see you.
Where's Denny Ryan?
Denny ain't comin' back.
Anyone else?
Evans, Burns and Long Louie.
Where's Johnson?
Hello, Wedge.
Hello, fella.
Well, this one's nearest my heart, anyhow.
What happened?
They wouldn't give us any guns.
We wanted to fight, but we didn't have no chance. They wouldn't give us guns.
Who wouldn't give you guns?
That gold braid over there.
The Japs sneaked in a landing party, infiltrated our covering posts, and then rushed the workmen.
The workmen?
You see, they're technicians who couldn't be replaced within 7,000 miles.
Getting them means more to the
Japs than getting us, out there.
Something ought to be done about this, Bob. Something will be done.
And I mean to see that it's done.
Mister?
I gave you a gang of men to build an airfield in the pacific.
They were whole men.
Take a look at 'em now!
I hope you can sleep nights.
Aren't you mixing your pronouns a little?
Didn't you refuse them arms to protect themselves?
That's right.
And I'm not apologizing for it.
Apologies won't bring back my men.
Are you Donovan?
Yes.
Then, you're just the man I want to see.
About what?
About what's eating you right now.
I didn't arm your men because civilians found armed are shot like spies.
It's a rule of war.
What do you think happened to them?
I know what happened to them. That's why the rules have to be changed.
We're not fighting men anymore.
We're fighting animals.
I want your men armed in the future, legally armed, and I'll need your help to do it.
Well, on second thought, I guess you don't make the rules.
Keep talking, sailor.
I'm Lieutenant Commander Yarrow.
This is Miss Chesley.
I'd like to talk to you about this as soon as possible.
Could you join us for dinner?
Well, I can't.
I'm giving a welcome-home party for my men at the St. George.
Why don't you two join us?
We could talk then.
Fine. We'll be there.
I'll be expecting you around 9.
Right.
And so, to you gentlemen of the
Donovan Construction Company, who have been so devoted, so unbegrudging, so stuffy, so...
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a toast to offer.

Excuse me a minute, will ya?
You're welcome, Commander.
Oh, thank you.
I'm Eddie Powers, Donovan's factotum, meaning, "Man Friday."
That's Latin.
I see. Well, I'm glad to know you,
Friday, even if it's only Thursday.
This is Miss Chesley.
The navy's "Blue Monday."
Pleased to meet you. If you follow me, you'll wallow in bubble water.
Well, here's Mr. Donovan.
Hello, hello.
The navy and his lady.
You hear our song?
Not a sour note in the whole gang.
Nothing like it at the metropolitan.
I'll say.
You seem to be a man of many talents, Mr. Donovan.
Don't be so susceptible, Connie.
I play a mean mouth organ myself.
You do, sailor? We'll have to play a duet sometime.
You were saying this afternoon that I could help you.
That's right.
How?
By coming with me to Washington, representing the construction angle.
Helping me sell my plan to the navy.
Sell the idea of arming construction gangs? What is there to sell?
Well, there's a...
Oh, nothing at all, just an Admiral or two, and a few battleships to be pushed around.
There's more to it than you think.
Could you find me a thousand men- cat-skinners, hoisters, drillers... every kind of specialist in their proper proportion?
You have 'em, sailor.
All we'll have to do...
You do things easily, Mr. Donovan, by just a wave of the hand.
Who was it flung seeds on the earth, and saw furrows of armed men... rise from them between sunset and sunrise?
Or vice-versa?
That was St. Patrick, ma'am.
Eddie, will you do me a favor?
Name it, boss, and it's a fait accompli, meanin' "in the bag".
That's French.
Take baby snooks out and buy her a Popsicle.
Connie, it looks like...
I'm quite capable of recognizing a hint when I hear one.
Shall we waltz, Mr. Powers?
I must be warnin' you, Miss.
I'm no terpsichorean.
It's a relief to be out of earshot of that important baboon.
Oh, don't let the boys hear you call him that, lady, or you'll go home in a state of "ecdysical" embarrassment.
I will?
You will.
Oh, Mr. Powers, if I go home in a state of "ecdysical" embarrassment, how will I go home?
Wearin' nothin' but your hat!
Frankly, I don't get it, his throwing a brawl like this for his men, when they come home with five dead and four crippled.
That's Donovan's way of showing his appreciation for the men who did a job.
Oh.
I suppose you'd like a drink.
Well, that I would, ma'am.
Shall we sit here?
Please, that's for the five who didn't come back.
I see.
How did you come to work for Donovan, Eddie?
I didn't. He came to me.
To you?
Yep. I was the boss of a sewer gang in Brooklyn, and he braced me for a job.
I should have chased him off, but
I gave him a muck shovel instead.
He looked starved.
I'll never forget.
He was only 14... and skinny as a rail!
But I'd still like that drink, ma'am.
Well, Eddie, suppose you go and get yourself one?
Well, thank you.
How you doing?
I haven't had a real chance to talk to him yet.
He has promised to come to
Washington. They'll listen to him.
His reputation in construction is tops.
There's more than that to his reputation. I looked in our files.
So?
Let me warn you that your friend Donovan... is a hotheaded ape with a hair-trigger temper.
When he's nice, he's very, very nice, and when he's not, he's stinkin'.
Hello. Yeah?
Wait a minute. Hey, Wedge.
Yeah?
The manager of the hotel wants to talk to ya.
So it's you again.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're the manager and we're makin' too much noise.
So what? I rented this suite till 10:00 tomorrow morning.
I don't want any more calls.
Ain't wantin' to get any more calls?
No.
Ain't gonna make any calls out?
No!
Hey, Wedge.
This her is "Twinkles" Tucker.
She claims to be a champion jitterbug.
But she says she'll no dance with anyone but the boss.
Come on, Wedge. Get in there. Oh, come on, Wedge.
What do I do now?
Pull.
Hey, jitterbug!
Attaboy, Wedge.
I like your finish.
Yeah, "finish" is right.
So don't forget, we've got a date.
Gonna see you tomorrow in Washington, 11:00.
Captain Joyce's office.
I'll be there, right on the pin.
Say, uh, what do you two do for an encore?
Oh.
Right on the pin. Ready to go?
All set.
What are you doing here?
Waiting to join you two... in a little celebration at lunch time, I hope.
It's in the bag.
You can order the wine.
Captain Joyce will see you now.
Oh, thank you.
Don't you wish you could come inside and hear what's going on?
Might make a front-page story.
Want me to fix it up for ya?
Don't bother.
I'll know more about it in
24 hours than you will.
It's nice to see you, Bob.
Thank you, sir.
This is Mr. Donovan. Captain Joyce.
Good morning, Mr. Donovan.
Good morning.
Your name is a familiar one to this bureau.
Sit down, won't you, please?
Thank you.
Commander Yarrow wanted you on hand when he discussed some matter with me.
Mr. Donovan had a construction job on the island when the Japanese attacked, sir.
Most of his crew were killed.
Yes, I know.
If these men had been in uniform, they might still be alive.
They would be alive.
And I submit, sir...
No, thank you... that every day this war makes more and more demands... for construction under combat conditions... airfields, roads, beachhead installations.
The navy has been impressed by that fact ever since pearl harbor.
We've been giving it consideration in principle.
You have a definite suggestion to offer?
I'd like to suggest the raising of a model basic unit, large enough to include the specialists and machinery to do any kind of a job.
Say a 1,000 men, sir, self-contained, self-sufficient.
A battalion, a construction battalion.
Right.
And I can get you the men for it: bulldozers, blasters, drillers, cat-skinners.
Any men you want, and the best in the country.
That would be a model basic unit indeed, Mr. Donovan.
I'll take it up with the Admiral.
In the meantime, you're attached to my office.
I want you to prepare a complete, detailed report.
Concentrate first on a training program.
Yes, sir.
Why waste time?
What training do they need?
Training to fight.
Training to fight? You might as well start training them to drink.
I'm offering you construction crews, not white-collar lads.
They know what it is to fight.
Every rock tunnel they drill costs a man a mile.
And every steel span they bridge costs another.
They know that when they take the jobs.
But, Mr. Donovan...
All they want is something in their hands when the trouble starts.
That's not the navy's opinion, sir.
We send no man into action until he has been disciplined, conditioned, and taught to use his weapon.
That'll take months.
It may take 3 months, it may take 12 months.
That doesn't make any difference.
If we send out one untrained man, some mother may pay for our impatience with the life of a son.
Look, I've got 3 contracts in the pacific, and my men mean as much to me as yours do to the navy.
What are they, expendable?
I want 'em armed.
The arming of civilians is prohibited by an international convention, not by the United States Navy.
There is nothing you or
I can do about that.
Isn't there?
I have a contract here for an airfield on island X-214.
I'm going there personally and take my best crew.
And if Tojo and his bug-eyed monkeys get in our way, you and the navy may find out you have a construction unit... and a combat unit rolled into one!
Wait, Wedge.
For how long, 3 months, 12 months?
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I'm not built for waiting.
You learn that in the navy, not in the construction business.
What happened?
You'll know more about it in 24 hours than I do, Miss Chesley.
Hey, Collins. Where about's is Flatbush from here?
That's it over there, and you better take a good look at it, because the Dodgers'll win the World
Series before you ever see it again.
This job's supposed to take
30 days, not 30 years, Collins.
Got a cigarette?
Yeah.
So long, New York.
We won't see a good-lookin' pair of legs until we see you again.
Oh, I wouldn't say that, Speck.
Well, if it isn't Inter-Ocean's special ace! How are you, Connie?
Fine, you old son of a gun.
Hello, fellows.
Say, this is great!
How do you do, Mr. Donovan?
Well, what are you doing aboard?
Same thing as these alleged gentlemen of the press.
Oh, by the way, the
Captain wants to see you.
What for?
So he can throw your junk out of the bridge deck cabin and put mine in.
Are you gonna be a nuisance on this trip?
No more than usual, Mr. Donovan.
Sure you're not running out on your boyfriend?
You'll know more about that in 24 days.
Twenty-four days? How come?
They flew Bob out to island
X-214 last Wednesday, as officer in charge of construction.
Oh, and now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to get settled in your...
I mean, my cabin.
So, teacher's pet is on her way to Australia for news too.
Uh-huh, on 30 minutes' notice, sweetheart.
Anybody got an extra pair of nylons in their pocket?
Nylons?
That ought to be easy, I always...
Excuse me, I think I observe an acquaintance.
You're a fine bundle of mollycoddles.
I give you a little party last night, and now look at ya.
Why don't you be men, like I am?
Hey, Novasky, a glass of ice-water, quick.
I think I had too much fish last night.
Was that what you was drinkin'?
Looks like we're shipmates, old sesquipedalian.
"Sesquipe-who-lian"?
"Pedalian."
Oh, sesquipedalian, is it?
Uh-huh.
Eddie? Eddie, is that good?
I wouldn't know, Novasky.
I never run across that canary in all the crossword puzzles I've seen so far.
That means, "a user of big words",
Mr. Powers. Now we're even.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, it's you.
Yes, it's pretty.
Watching a ship's wake always makes me think... of the things that time puts behind us forever:
Hopes, dreams, illusions.
What does it make you think about?
If they changed the pitch of that propeller, we'd get a couple of more knots out of this thing.
I thought I'd caught you being human for once.
Don't you have anything under that thick hide of yours... except cylinders and a carburetor?
A spark plug, maybe.
The last time I saw a night like this, I was in Hawaii.
Ever been to Hawaii?
No.
Europe?
No.
Why not?
Never had the time.
Why didn't you make the time?
Oh, for the same reason.
Do I bore you, Mr. Donovan?
No, no.
Keep talking.
I will if you listen to me.
I'll listen to anything you have to say.
Then that makes it easy.
Why don't you help Bob put across his ideas for the construction battalions?
Oh, I tried...
You tried.
If you hadn't been such a hotheaded ape, he'd be working on it in Washington now.
What do you mean, now?
I mean, he was sent on this mission... to keep you from hunting trouble.
To play nursemaid to me, huh?
Don't be so contemptibly self-centered.
There's a war on.
What Bob wants to do is important, and you're the only man who can help him.
How?
Work out the details for a model unit with him.
Then fly back with him from the island.
Eddie Powers can take over your job.
Your going on it was only a gesture anyway.
The navy will have to listen to you when you talk its way.
They respect you for what you are, for what you've accomplished.
And if it's any added inducement, Wedge, so do I.
I'm sorry I did that.
For a minute, you made me forget.
Forget?
That you're Bob Yarrow's girl.
This is beautiful, ain't it?
Yeah, but it's hot.
Oh, we'll have a swell time here.
Yeah, a hot time.
Just like the movies, eh, Novasky?
Yeah, just like the movies.
Soon, me and Natasha will be right under them palm trees.
Soon, you and Natasha will be knocking down them palm trees.
Oh, sure enough. Wait, you blow 'em up! That's right.
How do you do, gentlemen?
I'm glad to see you.
How are you, Captain?
I'm Lieutenant Kerrick, commanding the navy detachment on the island.
This is Lieutenant Commander Yarrow, the officer in charge of construction.
How do you do, sir?
How do you do?
I believe we have some friends of yours on board, sir.
Hello, Bob!
Connie! What in the world are you doing here?
I'm on my way to Australia for Inter-Ocean.
"A woman's viewpoint on the war down under by our special correspondent."
By my special correspondent.
Come on, I want you...
Oh, sorry, Kerrick.
Lieutenant Kerrick, this is Miss Chesley.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Come on, let's go ashore.
Eddie!
Powers!
Get 'em ashore.
Step on it.
Okay, Wedge. All right, men, hit the deck. We're goin' ashore.
Showin' him a job is like showin'
Sawyer Collins a bottle of rye!
A bottle? Who has it?
Come on, come on.
We'll find a jug on shore.
Come on, now, get out of here.
Wait for me!
It's lovely here, Bob.
How far is it to the barracks?
Along the beach a little ways, and off to your right.
Nice seeing you again, Yarrow.
I hope it'll be nice, Wedge.
It will be if you leave me alone.
I'm just here to do a job.
The navy way.
Then how about telling me where my men are to stay?
Oh, that's Lieutenant Kerrick's end.
Will you talk to Mr. Donovan about where to billet his men?
We'll make room for
'em in the barracks.
I don't want 'em in the barracks.
They're not used to regulations.
In the islands, Mr. Donovan, it's not always what one wants.
It is with me.
Are you comfortable here, Bob?
Sleeping under a palm tree isn't so bad.
As you'll find out tonight.
I will?
Yes, you're staying ashore.
But don't worry about anything.
We've rented a porcupine to chaperone you.
Oh, I can't believe it!
It's like a little paradise.
Complete, even to the serpents.
Serpents?
Oh yes, but these aren't on the ground.
They have wings, and call themselves mosquitoes.
These are copra sheds, aren't they?
Uh-huh.
Using 'em?
No.
I'll have them cleaned out and fumigated for my men.
I'd advise against it.
I know what's best for my men, Lieutenant.
How are you, folks?
Hey, some friends of yours?
Preposterous, never saw the people before in my life.
No glamor.
Too plump.
Don't worry, they'll all look thin enough after you're here a month.
Hello there.
You know, Bob, I think it'll improve the north end if we dig a little deeper.
Sounds like a good idea, Tom.
We'll need bedding and dishes.
We'll take care of our own food, but you gotta take care of our water supply.
I've already made provision for that.
Good.
Now, where's the site for our airfield?
Come on over here.
I'll show it to you on a model.
With only 30 days to complete this job, we better start as of now.
You see, here's the station.
And over here's the quarry where you'll be supplied with your servicing materials.
Now, this brush section is the site of the airfield.
We'll start first with the east-west landing strip.
Start east-west?
That'll add a week on to the job.
Yes, but we want a place for planes to land as soon as possible.
I don't see any difference, but then, I'm no sailor.
Maybe I can show you the difference.
This wind rose shows that for the next 60 days, the prevailing winds will blow from an easterly direction.
And since an airplane has to land into the wind, or crack up...
We'll start with the east-west strip.
Right.
It's first things first in the navy, Mr. Donovan.
First of all is the military consideration.
Okay.
You make with the pencils, and we'll make with the shovels.
Have you ever tried to make a story jell when it didn't want to?
Not since I was a plebe before the commandant at Annapolis.
This is awful. The home office will take one look and put me on ice.
You better come up with something good before the next boat sails, or you'll be in the soup for staying over.
Oh, well, maybe Wedge Donovan will dig up a buried city, or get himself captured by cannibals.
Maybe he will.
Speaking of that big ape, have you seen him around today?
I'm on my way to see the "big ape" right now. Want to come along?
I certainly do.
Where is he?
Much too close,
I'm afraid.
As a matter of fact, he's standing between us right now.
I suppose I should pretend I don't know what you mean by that.
But I won't.
Am I wrong?
Yeah, you're wrong.
Connie, look, for the past few days, all you've done is...
All I've done is what?
Well... is to tell a man in a thousand little ways...
Tell what man in a thousand little ways?
Well, not with words maybe, but with looks, actions and...
Aren't you ashamed?
All right. Maybe, as you say, I'm wrong.
This is the last one, Yump!
It's enough.
Come on, Brick.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, I'll be all right here.
I'd rather you came with me.
Okay.
Okay, Johnny.
I'll check on that one.
You know, Wedge, I could shoot these dynamite sticks... just as good as Yump.
Why don't you give me a chance blasting?
Never made a mistake?
Never.
Well, that lets you out.
In order to be a good blaster, you've got to have made a mistake... and still be alive.
Why do they say Yump's the best?
'Cause he's the oldest.
Fire!
Fire in the hole!
There she goes!
Get that stuff ground up as quick as you can.
I'll be down at the north end.
Right, boss.
Get back to work, Brick.
Swede, I know I can blast just as good as Yump.
Get outta here.
Some day I'm gonna blow you up.
Mr. Collins!
Hah?
Oh, there you are.
That was a bonnie wee tune I was singin'.
I must get it in my own key someday.
Could you tell us...
Would you, uh, care for a cigarette?
I'd like one.
Oh, it's silly the way they pack these things.
You know, you can't get at 'em.
Would you excuse me just a moment?
Uh-huh.
Here we are. Now, if you would do me the honor.
Hadn't you better count your fingers, Sawyer?
Oh, it always turns out the same. Ten or 12, roughly.
Where's Mr. Donovan?
Sawyer.
Aye, aye, sir.
I want eight twelve-by-twelves, ten feet.
Don't give me ten eight-by-eights, twelve feet.
And I want 'em without hemstitchin'.
What? No tattin'?
Go on. Go on.
And you'd be lookin' for
Wedge, I suppose, Miss?
That's right.
You'll find him down by the quarry, or over on the north end.
Aren't you afraid he'll stumble into that saw someday?
If he does, I'll kick his teeth in.
It's the only rip blade we've got left.
Why don't you make him cut down on his drinking?
Now now, would you want a man to work in an unnatural condition?
But how can he...
Bob.
Yeah?
May I speak with you alone, please?
Oh, sure, Tom.
Excuse me, Connie.
Sure.
I have a job to do, Miss.
You'll have to excuse me, too.
Right.
Dispatch report just came in from naval headquarters.
Big task force is forming up north.
We've been ordered on the alert till we learn what the Japs are up to.
Thought you'd like to know, Commander.
Yeah.
Any chance of 'em coming this way?
Who knows?
Harbor entrance protected?
Yes, we mined that.
But there's another entrance at the far end that's wide open.
The mine layer that was bringing the mines was torpedoed, and...
I didn't think you'd want the civilians to know.
No, no, no.
This is...
Better that they don't know.
Thanks, Tom.
What's the secret, are you going to tell me this time?
Oh, no. This one
I keep all for myself.
Hello, Charlie.
Hi, Wedge.
Hey, they're doin' all right.
Yep.
They check with you about section three yet?
Yes.
Yump'll have that gravel up here for you pretty soon.
We can use it.
Hello.
Hi.
Yarrow, I'm ready for those changes in the blueprints.
You mean, you'll be ready for them in the morning.
I mean we're ready for 'em tonight.
I'll put a gang to work and have the foundations laid by midnight.
What are you going to use for light?
Electricians are rigging some floods.
I'm sorry. Blackout regulations.
All work stops at sunset.
If you'll give us light, we can bring this job in under the deadline after all.
Sorry, Wedge, no light. And speaking of foundations, where are your daily reports?
These specifications call for a 1-2-3 mix and it's been two days now...
Gonna be difficult, huh?
I won't stand for halfway measures, Wedge.
Or did you learn that in Washington?
You've been tying up my production schedule ever since we hit this island.
All I want are your reports.
They've gotta know what you're doing.
How will they know from the reports?
When the job's finished, there'll be no more sand, no more gravel, no more cement.
Yeah, but there will be a report to that effect.
All right, Commander.
The reports'll be on your desk in the morning.
You know, he almost makes me dislike him.
Almost?
Mm.
How's it go?
Can you cook, too?
Uh-huh.
Corned beef and cabbage for dinner tonight.
Stop kidding.
Oh, I'm not kidding.
You really whipped up corned beef and cabbage?
Uh-huh.
Just for me?
Oh, don't be coy.
I like it too.
Do you, uh, smoke a pipe too?
Do you think I'd enjoy it?
What's it gonna get you, Connie?
All this business of filling my pipe, pouring my drinks, corned beef and cabbage.
You've got Eddie Powers and the rest of the gang laughing... at those cute little lunches you bring to the job.
Very well, if you don't want me to bring you lunch to the job,
I won't bring you lunch to the job.
Thanks.
And I don't want my slippers waiting for me every night, either.
And no flower for your buttonhole in the morning?
Oh, Wedge, you're mean.
Connie, this is strictly from Brooklyn, but... why don't you dance with the guy that brung ya?
Don't ever kid yourself that I'm not.
Why the act?
Because innately, you're a gentleman.
Thank you.
Not that anyone would suspect it from the way you've been acting.
No?
No. But because I know you're a gentleman, I...
Thank you again.
I know that sooner or later, kindness and consideration is going to wear you down.
Eventually, you might even agree that
Bob's idea for a navy construction unit... is so much bigger than Wedge Donovan... that you'll agree to become part of it.
That's why I'm being nice to you.
And believe me, for no other reason.
I'll bet you make the best corned beef and cabbage in the world.
Beautiful eyes, too.
Oh, about those sandwiches... if they're gonna have corned beef in 'em tomorrow, you better make a couple extra ones for Eddie Powers.
And don't forget the rest of the boys.
You go out to the south end and clear those trees out. Come here, bill.
Go over and get those bushes out of there, right away.
Eddie, you're slowing down to a walk.
I expected you to have that third section finished today.
For your information, my fine feathered friend, I'm six days ahead of schedule!
And if it weren't for butterfly rum, you'd be eight days ahead!
Butterfly rum, is it?
Well, if you're gonna finish this job, you better tell 'em to cut out that music.
Practice alarms. All right, get 'em down to the quarry.
All right, come in, men, all of you.
Come on in. Hurry it up.
Here, come on, lads.
Come on, get in the quarry.
Come on, you back there.
Come on.
Take it out!
Get goin', men.
Get goin'.
Hurry up, men.
Hurry up. Hurry up, men.
Come on, hurry up!
Let's move!
All right, come on you men.
Get going.
Step lively.
Bring those trucks in.
Thompson!
Murphy! Don't you ever get tired of playing this game?
Post seven reports enemy sighted, sir.
Surface craft.
Very well.
This must be the real McCoy.
It is.
What can I do?
Well, I'll explain the situation to you, so as things develop you'll know what's going on.
Lieutenant Kerrick has left me in charge here... while he's withdrawn his force up the hill.
Until he knows where the main attack is coming from.
Enemy sighted, sir.
Two destroyers.
Bearing 2-7-0 degrees.
Very well.
Bronson!
Relay that message to Lieutenant Kerrick.
Aye, aye, sir.
We'll be shovin' off now, Murphy.
Aye, aye, sir.
All right, let's go.
We're moving back.
All right, Donovan, get going.
And take it easy up that dirt road.
Enemy gunners don't ask for a better target than the dust cloud from a truck.
Okay, we'll stay put, as long as the navy keeps the Japs off of us.
You'll stay put as long as the navy tells you to. That's an order.
That's one way to win an argument.
Connie!
We have most of the women and children down at the bomb shelter.
Donovan!
Take her with you!
McClory! Load up on those trucks, men!
Bring those trucks in!
Get aboard there, men.
Come on, let's get outta here.
According to specifications, score one for the navy.
Get inside.
Stay back, away from the entrance.
What's goin' on, Wedge?
We got visitors.
The Japs figure on taking over the island.
You mean they're comin' ashore?
Right.
We took some of this before, Wedge.
We ain't sittin' it out again.
You bet your life we ain't.
They're not knockin' us off like Ryan and Olson.
And Evans, and Buttons.
And Long Louie.
How far is it from here to where these "Japanesers" will be?
They might be a stubborn race, but they come apart easy.
Kerrick and his sailors are waiting for them at the airfield.
Then what are we waiting for?
Come on, let's get going!
All right, gents! This war is reserved for the boys in the little white hats.
We're to stay here where we're safe.
Navy orders.
Oh, them navy.
You got him, Wedge?
Yep.
I know some first aid, Wedge.
Maybe I can help him.
Can't help him.
Take care of him.
Eddie?
Right here, Wedge.
Where'd you stash those guns?
In the covered truck, next to the crane.
Look out.
Run to your right, Wedge!
Here you are, boys.
Help yourselves.
Range 1-5, double-oh.
Range, a thousand yards.
They're walking right into it.
Shall we let 'em have it?
Why don't you wait a couple minutes longer, Tom?
Let 'em get their necks really stuck out.
The crazy fools.
Now we'll have to attack.
Fix bayonets.
Take to cover!
Take to cover.
Get in the underbrush.
Take to cover.
For the first time in my life,
I'm sorry I'm in a uniform.
What did you want us to do? Stay and get picked off like clay pigeons?
We had 'em cold. No human could have lived in that cross fire for five seconds.
You mashed it by bringing your civilians in here.
We couldn't fire without killing you.
All right, go on. Look around.
See what you've done.
Every civilian here was wounded or killed because a fool wouldn't obey orders.
Wedge.
Wedge!
Find a doctor!
Yes, the doctor.
Oh, Connie, why didn't you stay in the bomb shelter?
I was running to f...
Anything I can do, sir?
She does look pretty bad, sir.
Get out of here.
Do I?
Do I look bad, Wedge?
Yeah, your lipstick's on crooked.
Wedge, I'm frightened, I...
I don't want to die.
Oh, cut it out, crybaby.
Wedge, hold on to me!
I can't see you.
It's your hair.
Don't run out on me now, Connie.
Who'd get me my slippers?
Or fill your pipes.
Or put a flower in my buttonhole?
Cook... cook...
Corned beef and cabbage.
I loved it!
You called it an act.
Oh, that was double-talk.
I'll trade you... for plain English.
Shoot.
I love you.
Well, wh-what am I... supposed to say?
Only... only what you feel.
I love you.
Connie?
Connie?
Connie, I love you.
Did you hear what I said?
I love you!
Doctor!
Please hurry.
Step outside, please.
A little rough.
Yeah.
You did a lot of talking in there, Wedge.
I'd have done the same thing for anyone in that condition.
What difference does it make?
She might live.
Stretcher!
How is she?
She's resting easily.
She has a 50-50 chance.
Hey, Chico.
Chico, please.
Hey, Chico.
My leg.
The bandage is too tight.
Underneath there... Oh!
Hiya, boss.
Who won?
Looks like our team got in over our heads.
Preposterous.
Our team won, didn't it?
Did you see Johnny there in action?
Yeah.
And that monkey with things on his collar, the one Whanger got hold of.
Did you see how he fell apart?
Aw, snap out of it, Wedge. Ain't we been tangled with tough jobs before?
And ain't we always licked 'em?
Well, we'll lick
'em this time too.
We won't get the chance.
Navy's ordered this island evacuated.
Ridiculous.
So we'll square accounts on another island. You'll see.
Something you fellas oughta know.
Go ahead, Yarrow.
Spill it.
Donovan made a mistake today.
But that's one of the most terrible things about war.
You gotta think instantly, make your moves almost without thinking.
And yet, what you think or do preserves or destroys what you value the most... your men.
And when it's over, you can't think too much about that.
You can't take it too hard... because you have to keep right on going.
I'm ordered back to Washington.
The first man I'm gonna see when
I get there is Captain Joyce.
And you're going with me.
I'm here with my hat in my hand and no alibis.
I was wrong.
Rotten wrong and everything.
But I had to learn it the tough way.
I suppose Bob told you that his plan for a construction battalion... has been approved.
Commander Yarrow has had no other subject of conversation.
Mr. Donovan helped me with the organization of some of the specialist platoons.
Our first barracks at Norfolk are building.
Recruiting is about to open.
Oh, that reminds me, Donovan.
You once offered to help us find the right sort of recruits.
That's right.
How many men do you need?
A full battalion to begin with.
We'll need 1,100 men.
Ten hundred and ninety-nine, sir.
I thought you'd say that.
I'm in this thing any way you can use me.
Pushing a barrow, if that's the best I can get.
Sit down, Lieutenant
Commander Donovan.
Lieutenant Commander?
I suppose I'm a little premature in... addressing you that way, but I feel sure your papers will go through.
Congratulations, Wedge.
Yes?
Oh, I, uh, beg your pardon, Commander.
Congratulations, sir!
Yes, Admiral Scott.
A name for the new construction battalions?
Well, what's the matter with
"construction battalions"?
"No oomph," sir?
Well, a name like that would hardly be on my desk, sir.
Hold hard, sir.
I do have it.
It's the initials of the words
"construction battalion."
C.B.'s.
Spelled s-e-a-b-double e-s.
How do you like that?
Right, sir.
Right.
The Seabees they'll be.
♪ We're the Seabees ♪
♪ of the navy ♪
♪ We can build ♪
♪ or we can fight ♪

Donovan, the way you want this job done will take three days longer.
I don't care if it takes three weeks longer.
That's the navy way, and that's the way you're gonna do it.
And don't forget those daily reports.
All right.
You'll get your reports.
Sure, I've changed. I was never one for sittin' on fences.
No.
How about some chow?
Good.
Oh, from Connie in Honolulu.
She on her way back?
No, not yet, but she's doing fine.
She oughta take a good, long rest.
Two or three months, at least.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe by that time you'll have figured out what you're gonna say to her.
Hello? Yes. Yes...
I'll call you right back.
Hello, Kitty!
Oh, Connie, it's good to see you.
You look wonderful.
Thank you. So do you.
I think you've gotten a little thinner.
Oh, thank you.
Oh!
Oh, what beautiful flowers.
You must have had an exciting trip.
Well, it was rather hectic.
Where do we start, Kitty?
With these telephone calls, I guess.
Most of them are from Commander Yarrow.
He's due in town today.
Good!
Anything from, uh, Mr. Donovan?
No.
Lieutenant Commander Donovan?
No.
Maybe a telegram.
No.
Postcard?
No.
Well, might as well start work.
All right.
Hello, Connie.
Bob!
I'm so glad!
You're glad.
How do you think I feel?
And you're just as good as new again.
How do you come to be in Washington?
For regimental orders, and to meet some of the staff officers... who'll be responsible for our maintenance in the field.
Oh, so you can cuss them by name if you run short of supplies.
Seabees think of everything, don't they?
Some Seabees do.
Heard anything of Wedge?
Only what you wrote to me.
Oh.
You didn't write him?
Of course not.
I told you once before that I can take a hint as delicately put... just as well as anybody else, and if he doesn't hanker after my acquaintance, it won't be thrust upon him.
Well, if that's the way things are, I'd better break a date.
With whom?
Oh, Wedge, of course.
Wedge is here in Washington?
Sure, sure.
We've got a 24-hour leave. I'm meeting him at the Mayflower for dinner.
Thought you might like to go along, but if you feel...
The way I feel isn't going to interfere with your leave, or even his.
Who knows when you might get another?
Of course I'm going to the mayflower with you.
Why, you don't think I could be that petty, do you?
After all, the three of us have been under fire together.
You wouldn't kid a pal, would you, Connie?
No.
Or yourself, maybe.
I don't know yet, Bob.
Pardon me.
Martini, please.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm a friend of the head waiter, so we've got a table.
Miss Chesley, Lt. Commander Donovan.
We've met.
Yes.
A long time ago.
Shall we find our table?
Good evening.
Commander Yarrow's table.
Paul.
Commander Yarrow's table, please.
Very good, sir.
This way, please.
Well, this calls for champagne.
Uh, cocktails.
Very good, sir.
You should've warned me.
I'd have polished up the gold braid.
Your first lesson in battle tactics: surprise attack.
Your reconnaissance is faulty, Commander, or you wouldn't have been caught napping.
Yeah, but how do you like the tailor?
A gentleman and an officer, by an act of god, congress and his tailor.
Cigarette, Connie?
You know, you could've written a girl a postcard.
And have everyone from here to
Honolulu read our mail? Not me.
Such consideration is heartbreaking.
Don't be too tough on him.
We sweated him pretty hard.
Sure. Boot training, officer's training, military training.
I could've walked to you for the ground
I've covered. Look at my broken arches.
What a pity you didn't walk on your head.
Well, Bob kept me up to date on you.
I know everything that's happened.
That's more than I can say.
I remember the Japs attacking.
From there to the hospital ship, the pages are missing.
It's a little embarrassing,
It's like waking up on the street and discovering you've forgotten to put on your shoes.
Did I do or say anything I shouldn't?
Huh? No!
Shall we dance?
Yes.
I'm still waiting for you to tell me what happened.
You still have beautiful eyes, and you cook corned beef and cabbage better than anyone else in the world.
That I remember.
You really wanna know what you said?
Well, you said, just before you passed out, quote:
"You think you're an important ape, don't you?"
"Just because a girl lets you hold her hand in a moment of weakness,"
"don't get funny ideas,"
"'cause I'm still dancing with the guy what brung me."
I said that to you?
Well, I couldn't vouch for the exact words.
And what did you say?
I said you were dead right.
Is that the way you want the record to read?
That's the way I want it to read.
Good night, Miss Chesley.
Oh, I was telling Connie
I forgot I had a date.
And there she is.
Probably burning after waiting an hour.
Well, uh, I'll be seeing you both.
Have fun.
Looks like we're stood up.
Looks like we're not the only ones.
Here we are.
Won't you come in?
No, thanks. I'd rather not.
Bob, I wanna tell you that I know you're the best there is.
But that you don't want me.
Of course I want you.
I've always wanted you.
Whatever else may have happened,
I know I've let you down, but I just can help myself.
I wish there was something I could say against him, but I can't now.
Whatever was wrong with him before, and there was plenty, the Seabees have made right.
I just can't seem to get him out of my heart.
Whenever I come near him...
You can't help that.
That's the way I feel about you.
He turned me down tonight.
Yes, I know he did.
You know?
How?
Because I overheard what you told him on the island.
Oh, Bob.
And you can still talk to me like this?
For the same reason that you're still reaching after him.
I just told you,
I can't help it.
Thanks for understanding.
You'd better go to bed now.
All this excitement is too much for you.
I guess it is.
Good night.
Hey?
I thought a sailor always kissed a girl good night.
It's a old navy custom.
Good night, my dear.
My very dear.
It's not good night,
Connie, it's good-bye.
But why good-bye?
My orders this morning were to take the regiment to the pacific coast... to a port of embarkation.
Well, I hope the old man'll have some good news for us.
There's only one thing
I want to hear.
Good morning, Captain.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Gentlemen.
I have the orders you've been hoping for.
The regiment will assemble with full service equipment for embarkation at 2200 tonight.
That's good.
Great.
I can say to Comdr. Yarrow, and to you battalion Commanders as well, that I believe your men are ready for whatever lies before you.
Naturally, it is a particular satisfaction to be able to say that... in the case of a unit which is making its first appearance in naval history.
You'll have a chance to make
Seabee traditions, and I feel confident that you'll make them.
That's all, gentlemen. Good luck, Commander. Thank you, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you.
So that leaves the situation something like this...
Oh, by the way,
Kane, have you made preparations for landing the galley equipment?
Yes, sir.
Fine.
Uh, how's Hunter, Wedge?
He's making the trip by rail.
I was just telling the boys that yesterday a marine landing force cleared out our sector.
We're ready to move in.
No Japs left?
Only snipers and small patrols.
Naturally, you're expected to protect yourself against them.
Good.
Our main base will be here.
We'll disperse our installation so the Japs can't lay all their eggs in one basket.
Kane and Brackett will handle the beaches, Stewart the docks.
Hunter's outfit'll take care of the airfield, that is, if he ever gets over his seasickness.
That leaves the oil farm for me.
That's right, it's a hot corner too.
Five miles from anybody.
These shoal waters have some narrow channels in 'em.
Watch 'em, Wedge.
The Japs might try to sneak in patrols in small boats.
I will.
When do we land?
Tomorrow at dawn.
Japs or polecats.
Looks like we're alone.
Yeah, so far.
This'll be the campsite.
Lt. Hood!
Aye, aye, sir.
We'll go up the crest and establish a line of resistance.
Whanger, Sully, Murph,
Brick, Yump, Swede, Jacobs.
I'll stay here and mind the fire.
Yump, get down.
Don't worry, Commander.
There ain't no Japs here.
Yump!
Brick!
Turn me loose!
I'll get that Jap sniper!
Brick, get ahold of yourself!
Jacobs!
Yes, sir.
I want a machine gun emplacement here and one over on that spur... so we can cross-fire this area.
Aye, aye, sir.
Signal the ship we're ready... to start unloading operations.
Aye, aye, sir.
Keep your chin up, kid.
Harcroft!
Yes, sir?
Where's Mr. Donovan?
Tank number five, sir, over back of the ridge.
Hello.
I was wondering when we'd rate another visit.
I meant to get over sooner, Wedge, but I'm kinda busy myself.
Hey, you're doing fine here.
First tankers ordered in next week..
Good!
Fifty thousand barrels of oil oughta whet our appetite.
Could take a hundred if it weren't for these snipers.
Had three men hit today.
Where'd they get you?
Only the leg, Wedge.
I'll make it.
Stay put.
Bill, get a stretcher!
What do they expect a handful of patrols to do, clean out this whole jungle?
Give me a couple of companies... and I'll clean it out, pronto.
You're not here to fight Japs. You're here to fight time, and you're doing great.
Yeah, doing great, watching my men get knocked off like ducks in a birdbath.
What's the sense of it?
That's what I'd like to know.
Wedge...
Our job is to see that our task force gets oil.
Task force?
Yes. There's a carrier, a couple of cruisers and three transports coming in.
You're here to see that this depot gets finished.
Defend it if you have to, but get the job done.
Yes, sir.
That's it, Wedge.
That's it if Powers has finished the main gate.
Lt. Hood's compliments, sir
I mean respects, sir.
The tanker's ready to start pumpin'.
We'll open the main valve as soon as the last section is completed.
Thanks, Collins.
Stand by to load stretchers!
She's ready, chief.
Open 'er up.
Mr. Powers, we've done many a job together, you and I.
Sure, with me doin' the work and you the thinkin'.
Nevertheless, you're gonna get the honor of finishing this job.
Turn that valve. And remember, you're not windin' a watch.
Yes, sir, Mr. Donovan.
Yes, sir.

Tell Lieutenant Hood I want every man not on guard duty... with full combat equipment.
But, Wedge, Commander
Yarrow's coming here today.
I don't care if the old man's comin' here. That's an order!
Your orders clear?
Aye, aye, sir.
Proceed with your scouting parties.
Carry on, men.
Here it is, sir.
Big fog bank north of the island.
I don't like that. Japs might sneak in behind it.
In pea soup? They're as blind as we are in that stuff.
I wasn't thinking of planes, Lieutenant.
A lot of surface craft could float in under that blanket.
I'll be over at Lt. Comdr. Donovan's headquarters if you want me.
Yes, sir.
Where's Lt. Comdr. Donovan?
He's out there, sir.
Took about the whole force to run the Japs out of the jungle cover.
Who's in charge here?
I am, sir. Couldn't get along so good with this game leg.
How many men have you got in the camp?
Counting cooks, yeomen and everybody, about 15 men, sir.
I want every man that can walk or hold a rifle to fall in immediately.
Aye, aye, sir.
They won't fight.
They just fade away.
How about Lt. Hood?
It was the same there. They got a few. The others kept movin' back.
Well, there's 10 or 12 here won't go back.
Pass the word to reform!
Tell them we'll refuel them as fast as they can get here. Yes, sir.
All guns, commence firing.
D-21 tower from fox 20.
Carrier flight planes coming in for fuel and ammunition.
Tell them to come in low at east end. Condition red.
Roger.
They're all here, sir.
Coast battalion's under attack from the sea. Unable to send help.
A strong Jap force approaching up the north canyon, sir.
Carry on.
Aye, aye, sir.
The Japs know this island as well as we do.
The best approach to our tanks is up the big ravine.
We'll post our men and command the entrance. Aye, aye, sir.
Fix your bayonets and follow me, on the double.
Fall back!
Fall back, men!
Fall back to the ridge!
See if... Commander
Donovan's back.
Get word to him.
I want to see him.
Yes, sir.
Commander Yarrow wants to see you, sir.
He's up there behind those rocks.
Tell Lieutenant Hood to consolidate positions and hold here.
Aye, aye, sir.
Reporting, sir.
Upon completion of this mission,
I'll be making a full report about your... disobedience of orders.
Probably mean a court-martial.
Yes, sir. Is that all?
Island is under general attack.
I know.
If those oil tanks are destroyed, every ship, every man in our task force will be left helpless.
Protect those tanks at any cost.
They will be, sir.
Go on, Seabee. Hold the island.
Can do, sir.
Jap tanks. Tell Donovan.
Okay.
Jap tanks are coming up the north canyon, sir.
Get back to your post.
Mike, have 'em get that heavy equipment moved back where it'll be safe.
Aye, aye, sir.
They're bringin' in tanks!
That'll teach 'em to monkey with construction men.
What did you shoot him for?
I was afraid the fall might kill'im.
Get on that tank!
A hundred and fifty yards.
Another column.
Looks like they're trying to outflank us.
He says there's another Jap column comin' up the canyon... moving in behind the oil tanks.
Wedge, if they fire those tanks...
Yeah, I know... it'll barbecue every
Seabee in this ravine.
We can't split our forces.
We're outnumbered now.
Get me a thermite bomb and some wire.
Aye, sir.
What are you gonna do?
Beat 'em to those tanks.
Gonna set off number three and we'll have our own barbecue.
That'll fill that north canyon with enough hot oil... to scorch those nips back six generations.
Don't ride it too close.
Give yourself time to jump.
Don't worry.
I'm not taking any chances.
Finish that.
Aye, sir.
I want every spare machine gun you got at the head of this canyon... so you can rake the whole ravine.
But they've passed there already.
They'll be back.
Hold your fire till you get 'em under your guns, then let 'em have it.
The president of the united states... takes pleasure in presenting the services set forth in the following citation... for conspicuous courage and heroism in combat at island X-371... during June, 1942, at which time this battalion, greatly outnumbered and at a great cost of their own men, refused to give ground... and with typical American resourcefulness... overturned a burning fuel tank in the path of the enemy, wiping out his landing force... and thus preserving our refueling base.
Your deeds speak for themselves... and will continue to do so... from the shores of the Pacific... to the Arctic, from the coasts of Europe to the distant strands of Asia.
Memorials on which will be inscribed, in blood and fire, your own immortal challenge:
"We build for the fighters.
We fight for what we build."
Oh, son, how are you?
It's so nice to see you.
I'm proud of you, Bob.
Proud of all the Seabees.
Wedge was a great guy, Connie.
One of the best.
Yes, he was.
You're both great guys.
You loved him, didn't you?
I loved you both.
That might be a little difficult to understand, but it's true.
It's not too difficult.
When the reports of the attack came in over the teletype... and we didn't know whether any of you would come back... a girl can be in love with two men at the same time... until that happens.
What are you trying to say?
I'm doing a very bad job of saying...
I love you, Commander.

The riches of the new world are limitless, and the new world is ours.
With our ships carrying the
Spanish flag to the seven seas.
Our armies...
Sweeping over Africa, the near east, and the far west...
Invincible everywhere but on our own doorstep.
Only northern Europe holds out against us.
Why?
Tell me. Why?
If you will permit me, sire.
Our depleted treasury.
An army can advance only to the end of its purse strings.
Nonsense. That is not the real reason, Peralta.
Why not admit it?
The reason is a puny, rock-bound island as barren and treacherous as her queen, who secretly gives aid to her enemies while her pirates plunder our commerce.
You know as well as I, Peralta, we cannot keep northern Europe in submission until we have a reckoning with England.
It is not yet time, your majesty.
Not until the armada is built.
Time?
The destiny of Spain cannot wait upon the fitness of time.
I have but one life, and that life is all too short for me to fulfill that destiny.
Don Alvarez.
Sire.
You will proceed at once to England as my ambassador.
You will assure the queen of my Patience and continued affection to allay any suspicion in regards to our plans.
As you wish, your majesty.
With England conquered, nothing can stand in our way.
Northern Africa,
Europe as far east as the Urals, then the new world...
To the north, to the south, west to the pacific, over the pacific to China and the indies will our empire spread.
One day before my death, we shall sit here and gaze at this map upon the wall.
It will have ceased to be a map of the world.
It will be Spain.
Aloft, there!
Hold taut on the bow line!
We are losing wind.
I regret our slow passage, your excellency, but it seems our sail cannot entice the wind.
Then we shall not reach
England by Wednesday.
Perhaps...
If the galley holds out.
Captain Lopez, it is extremely important that my niece be presented to the queen before her new maids of honor are chosen.
They say that Elizabeth surrounds herself with beauty in the hope that it may be contagious.
Your niece will have no trouble meeting the queen's requirements.
María, you might hit it once where I can reach it.
You said you needed the exercise, Martha.
Well, I've had it, enough for the whole voyage.
Ready, Martha?
Yes, love.
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.
Send another lookout aloft to the Mizzentop.
Yes, sir.
Another lookout aloft to the Mizzentop!
Why these extra precautions, captain?
Isn't there folks who look out enough?
I am responsible for your safety, your excellency, and we are entering the lanes of the English pirates.
How very interesting.
If your men spy any of their ships,
I wish you'd let me know.
Like hawks, Don Alvarez, they're on you before you see them.
They say the devil blows in their sails.
Surely, you don't believe these myths, captain.
At any rate, they would hardly dare attack a ship with his majesty's ambassador aboard.
It would be as much as their heads are worth when the news reached the queen.
Perhaps. Excuse me, your excellency, but the wind does not serve well.
Boatswain!
Aye, aye, sir.
Raise the beat
8 counts.
At once, captain.
There below...
Raise the beat of the oars
8 counts.
Aye, aye.
8 counts, señor.
Raise the beat
8 counts.
I know where we are.
You can't tell, William.
We haven't known where we were for months.
I'm sure this time.
Feel the motion, the ground swell?
Only one place like that...
The English channel.
The English channel.
We're in the English channel.
The English channel.
The English channel.
The English channel.
English channel.
English ship off the starboard bow!
Boatswain, have the drummers beat to quarters!
Master gunner, have the deck cabin double-shotted.
An attack!
Hold back on your oars.
Pretend to row.
Hold back on your oars.
Have your men in positions!
To your stations!
Gun crews to your stations!
Charge your Cannon and stand ready to repel attack!
Send the archers and musketmen to their positions.
Archers and musketmen, to your stations!
Master-at-arms, double the guard at the main hatch.
Double the guard at the main hatch!
Run out your guns!
Pay your sights to his rigging!
I must ask you to go below, Don Alvarez.
You will not be safe here.
The pirates won't dare attack when they see the king's emblem.
Guns may stop them...
Nothing else.
Raise the beat to 20!
Aye, aye, señor!
Raise the beat to 20!
Get together!
Together, I said!
Faster, you British dogs!
Faster!
Pull some weight with that oar!
Ahoy, captain!
It's Thorpe's ship!
The albatross!
Thorpe?
Why, that's impossible!
Only a month ago he was at San Domingo.
Look, captain...
On the staff!
The bearer of the albatross.
You better take cover below, Matey, or you'll be stopping a cannonball.
She's hauling closer to the wind!
Feast your eyes on that!
The Spaniard mounts 40 guns if she mounts one.
She's loaded down, too.
Maybe she's too big a bite for our teeth, Matson?
Did you ever see a Spaniard the captain couldn't swallow whole?
Captain's got the Spaniards bewitched, that's what he has.
Yes, and didn't we dust off his royal highness' britches, too?
Aye by that, me lad, and the dust was worth
30 shillings to the ounce.
What a prize!
And I don't think she'll get away from us, Scott?
The albatross isn't a barge you can run away from.
We're sucking the wind out of the Spaniards' sails.
Well, if it's air that they need, we can put a draft through their bow pretty quick.
Captain! What about it?
Shall we let them have a round?
You fire when I give the word, Mr. Pitt.
Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Preston!
Aye, aye, sir.
Give them a hail, if you please, Mr. Preston.
Suggest they lower their colors.
Aye, aye, sir.
Señor captain!
Lower your flag!
Lower your flag!
It would be just like that Spaniard to surrender and spoil all our fun!
Perfectly possible,
Mr. Pitt.
Once more, Mr. Preston.
You hear me?
Lower your flag!
One lone cannonball out of an entire broadside!
Very well, Mr. Pitt.
Show them how to lower those colors.
Aye, aye, sir.
Scott, teach them some etiquette.
Aye, aye!
Ready, men?
Lay for the foremast and fire on the uproll.
Aye, aye, sir!
Get us ready for a broadside!
Primed and ready, sir!
Primed and ready, sir!
Fire!
Stand by to come about on a larboard tack!
Go to your posts!
Go to your posts!
Gunners, stand by to rake her stern!
Fire!
Get off there!
Heave the dead overboard!
Now, hard to starboard.
Starboard your helm.
The Spaniard's listing, captain.
We must have hit it below the waterline!
Very good, Burke.
Cease firing!
Cease firing!
Cease firing!
Lances and cutlasses now, men!
We're going to board her!
A sharp edge to cut the gold buttons off the Spanish captain's epaulet!
Now, men!
Nobody's to board her before I give the word.
Is that clear?
Aye, aye, sir!
All right,
Mr. Preston!
Haul into her hard over her starboard!
Grappling hooks away!
Away!
Ha ha!
Over the side, men!
Boarders away!
Your ship's sinking, captain.
Then we shall drown together.
Brave but impractical.
Now, we English are a practical people.
I have no intention of drowning with you.
- Mr. Pitt!
- Aye?
The trumpeter. Quick!
Aye, aye, sir!
Sound a surrender.
Hurry while there's still breath in your belly.
I congratulate you, captain.
Very fortunate moment for the surrender.
- Mr. Scott.
- Aye, aye, sir.
You'll take charge.
Muster the prisoners and stack the weapons forward.
To the main deck, men!
- Disarm them!
- Aye, aye, sir.
It's been a lovely day, hasn't it?
- Logan.
- Aye, sir?
Take enough men, go below, and free the slaves immediately.
Aye, sir.
Matson.
Come here.
Aye, sir?
That was very brave of you, trying to take this ship single-handed.
Thank you, sir.
Brave but stupid.
By disobeying orders, you risked the lives of the men behind you.
You should pay for that with your own, shouldn't you?
Yes, sir.
Preston!
Aye, sir?
Take this man aboard the albatross.
Have him put in irons.
Aye, aye, sir.
But, captain,
I was only doing me duty.
Now, you can't blame a man for doing that!
You can't blame me for that!
By the way, gentlemen,
I'd appreciate it if you'd pass the word among the officers and men that I consider their conduct very gallant.
Aye, aye, sir.
And yours especially,
Mr. Pitt.
Thank you for convincing the trumpeter.
Ha ha ha ha!
Looks like a very rich cargo, Mr. Pitt.
A windfall, captain, sir.
Gold, silver, and plenty of barrel stuff.
Look sharp there, boys.
Get it up on deck.
She's settling fast.
This door's locked, sir.
Lend him a hand there, will you, please?
Stand aside.
Uncle!
My child!
Child!
Now, men.
Let's look around in here.
If you'd be kind enough to stand to one side, please.
Thank you.
Are you the captain of these pirates?
Burke, lend Mr. Pitt a hand here
- with this chest.
- Aye, sir.
Now, men, just throw everything outside here in the passageway.
Sharp about it.
Boggs!
Couple of extra hands in here, sharp!
I am king Phillip's ambassador...
You'll pardon me, sir.
We're a little pressed for time. Your ship is sinking.
Mr. Pitt, if you find the ship's papers, we'll take those aboard, too.
Aye, sir.
Captain.
Not at all bad.
Uncle, my jewels!
Don't you dare touch those jewels!
An Englishwoman.
By heavens, an Englishwoman.
And not too proud of it at the moment.
Do you know, the last time
I laid my eyes on an Englishwoman...
Mr. Pitt, you'll have time to discuss that later.
Aye, sir.
Now, lads, get that sharply on the deck.
Your excellency, maría, these are not typical Englishmen.
Please don't think...
Quite right. They ain't all as 'andsome as we are!
Now, sir, if I may suggest, you...
You and your party had better go aboard my vessel.
Captain Thorpe,
I demand to know exactly what your intentions are.
To get you safely aboard my ship.
And to get you off again as quickly as possible.
I'll land you at the first English port.
I'll not go on your ship.
I'd rather drown than accept your hospitality.
I...
Mr. Pitt, this young lady,
I hope, will change her mind.
If she doesn't, change it for her and have her carried aboard.
Aye, sir.
- Bosun!
- Aye, sir!
Logan, winters, these men are weak.
Get them over the side and see they don't fall.
Preston!
Come on, men!
Come on, men!
Over the side!
Come along, ladies.
You heard what the captain said, and orders are orders.
Captain! Captain!
Tuttle!
Why, tuttle, it must be 4 years since we sailed together.
It's 4 years since that I've trod the deck of an English ship, sir.
Well, you'll soon be in England, now.
Now, come along, all of you, and I'll see you all catch up with your rum rations.
Captain Thorpe, this is an insult to his majesty.
I board your ship under protest.
At least you'll find
English hospitality better than they found Spanish.
Mr. Pitt, as soon as the slaves are transferred, see the ambassador and his party
- get on board, too.
- Aye, sir.
All right, men.
Stand by, ready to move.
With speed there, men!
Get that stuff loaded below!
Keep those rails clear.
Lively now!
Abandon ship.
Everybody over the side.
Now, then, captain.
You've heard the order.
With your permission, sir.
I'm still the captain.
Yes, of course.
My mistake, captain.
Let go of those lines.
Watch your amidships.
- Cut!
- Aye, sir.
And have all sails trimmed, if you please, Mr. Scott.
Haul in your mainline and clear your port host.
Quartermaster, hold her steady as she goes.
Steady as she goes.
Steady as she goes.
Men, from now on, both crews will lay aside past differences.
Spanish sailors will have full freedom of the decks, with the exception of the powder magazine.
Those of you lately called slaves will have no further duties aboard this ship.
Hooray!
And if there are those among you who are still for the sea, why, we've plenty of berths on this ship for good and willing men.
By now, you know the purpose of the sea hawks...
In our own way, to serve England and the queen.
Hooray! Hooray!
Mr. Burke, dismiss all these men, if you please, and attend to their needs.
Now, your excellency, we'll try to make you and your party just as comfortable as this somewhat overcrowded ship permits.
Mr. Pitt will show you the way.
Are my men to be freed when we land?
Why, certainly, captain.
We have no inquisition in England.
No. We understand you believe in direct action.
Don Alvarez,
I can appreciate your feelings, but since fate has thrown us together, why then, let's make the best of it.
It was a clever strategy,
Captain Thorpe, to sound the surrender.
Why, thank you, captain.
Perhaps one of the secrets of victory is making your enemy anticipate defeat, don't you agree?
More wine, your excellency?
No, thank you.
I must compliment you on your wine, captain.
Nowhere have I tasted better.
There is no better wine than good Madeira, captain.
Cross, just where did we pick this up?
From the galley out of
Vera Cruz, captain.
No, it wasn't.
It was out of the governor's cellar at Cartagena.
No, Cartegena's the place we had all the Portuguese cheeses, don't you remember?
But there's no cheese like Cheshire, is there, Mr. Pitt?
No place like England for anything, to my way of thinking.
I was just thinking to myself, Miss Latham, weren't you a bit lonesome in a heathen country like Spain?
Spain is an old country with a very rich culture,
Mr. Pitt. In fact, there is much in Spain that we English could profit by.
Thank you, madam.
Well, we're certainly doing the best we can.
I have also been admiring your table silver, captain.
No doubt another of the captain's acquisitions.
No doubt. Perhaps if your excellency will examine the design, you'll recognize the coat of arms of the Spanish viceroy of San Domingo.
San Domingo?
How interesting.
I should like to propose that we drink to the health of...
I do not drink with thieves and pirates.
The health I was about to propose was to her majesty, the queen of England.
Mr. Pitt, obviously
Doña María has no wine.
To her majesty, the queen.
To the queen.
"Build a fleet.
Build a fleet."
Always the same advice.
As if I didn't have enough demands on my treasury.
If milord admiral is so intent on building a fleet, perhaps he will also advise me where to get the money to pay for it.
Your pardon, but may
I remind your grace that our privateers have made substantial contributions for the very purpose of providing a Navy?
A large fleet is a luxury that England can ill-afford.
You can tell your friends the sea hawks that I have more urgent uses for their contributions.
Besides, there's another risk which sir John fails to reckon.
Should England attempt to vie in sea power, it may cost her the friendship of Spain.
I believe milord values too highly something which doesn't exist.
Have we any evidence of Phillip's friendship?
His forbearance when our privateers harass his commerce and plunder his possessions.
I suspect that Phillip forbears only because...
Well, what else can he do?
He can bide his time, your majesty, until his great armada is built, and then he can strike quickly before we are ready.
I fear sir John has delusions of danger, your grace.
Spain is a vast empire.
Naturally, she needs a vast fleet to defend it.
The armada's no threat to England unless, by provoking Phillip, we choose to make it so.
Let me be clear,
Wolfingham.
My reason for refusing to build a fleet is to spare the purses of my subjects, not the feelings of Phillip.
In fact, I have some serious questions to put to his ambassador.
Is Don Alvarez now due?
Overdue, your grace.
I feel some concern for his safety.
Spanish ships are notoriously slow.
He should have come on an English boat.
Lift sails!
Look at him, will ya?
He's as tongue-tied as a schoolboy.
He's always the same when he has to talk to a woman.
Him what's taken fleets of Spanish ships can't trade words with a slip of a girl.
I can't figure him at all.
Ship's the only thing he cares about.
He hates the sight of bloomin' women.
Not the queen, he don't.
I hear her majesty's the only woman he could ever talk up to without his knees buckling.
That's different.
Man-to-man, I calls it.
Ha ha!
Ha ha!
Come on, get on with your work.
What are you standing there for?
Well, good morning.
Have you...
Have you been comfortable on board?
Yes.
Good.
Well, that promontory over there, the one you're looking at, it's got a very interesting history.
It got its name from...
From...
Yes?
Well, I don't remember how it got its name.
Have you been comfortable on board?
Yes, thank you.
Good.
Of course, we haven't many of the luxuries of galleys, but she's a fine ship.
We're quite proud of her.
Are you?
Yes.
Well, at all events, you'll find her safer from attack...
And you'll get there quicker, too.
We've an old proverb in England.
It says, "those who sail without oars" stay on good terms with the wind."
You...
You don't care to talk.
I'm not in the habit of conversing with thieves.
I thought I made that quite clear, Captain Thorpe.
Why, yes, all except your definition.
Tell me, is a thief an Englishman who steals?
It's anybody who steals, whether it's piracy or robbing women.
I see.
I've been admiring some of the jewels we found in your chest, particularly the wrought gold.
It's Aztec, isn't it?
I wonder just how those Indians were persuaded to part with it.
Ease your foresheet!
Ease your foresheet!
Haul in your spritsail!
Haul in your spritsail!
England!
Your grace.
Lord Wolfingham.
With your grace's permission,
I wish to present to your majesty his excellency Don José
Alvarez de Córdoba, ambassador from the court of Spain.
Your majesty.
Welcome to England, your excellency.
Thank you, milady.
May I present my niece,
Doña María
Alvarez de Córdoba?
Your niece will grace
England by her presence.
You're very kind, your majesty.
And you are very beautiful.
Don Alvarez, milord chancellor informs me that you bring new grievances from your much aggrieved monarch, king Phillip.
There is nothing milord and king desires more than an end to grievances between our two nations and the growth of friendship.
Then it may be well for him to consider that friendship grows slowly when nurtured only by complaints.
May I suggest, your grace, that the misunderstandings between ourselves and his excellency's government arise from one source alone...
The piratical acts of English privateers?
Reprisals, lord Wolfingham, are not piratical acts.
Last year, did not king Phillip confiscate 12 English ships loaded with grain in Spanish ports?
Do I understand your grace to justify this murderous assault on my ship on the grounds of...
You forget, Don Alvarez, the queen needs justify nothing!
However, I had no intention of forgetting an insult to an ambassador to the court.
How much treasure was there, Don Alvarez?
Approximately
30,000 pounds, besides the loss of the ship.
And where is
Captain Thorpe?
As soon as I was informed of the incident, your grace,
I took the Liberty of summoning here all the sea hawks now in port.
You are very thoughtful, milord.
Your grace.
Admit the sea hawks at once.
Captain Frobisher, captain Hawkins, captain Wolfe, captain Stanley, captain Logan, captain Latour.
Your majesty.
Where is
Captain Thorpe?
Did you hear me?
Where is Captain Thorpe?
We haven't seen him, your majesty.
It appears he disregarded milord chancellor's summons.
I anticipated that, your grace, and dispatched a castle guard to bring him here under arrest.
You show great foresight, milord.
Your grace.
Well, captain Hawkins?
Any of us would willingly act as hostage to assure your grace of
Captain Thorpe's appearance.
An easy pledge, captain Hawkins, with the castle guards already dispatched to bring him here under arrest.
If I may speak for my associates,
I feel we must share the burden of your displeasure with Captain Thorpe.
I see. You approve of his activities.
We share his views, your grace, and to the best of our ability, his activities in behalf of England.
Then hereafter you will allow me to determine in what manner
England may best be served!
Who dares to...
Captain Thorpe begs an immediate audience, your grace.
Admit him.
Yes, your grace.
Your majesty.
Captain Thorpe, why did you fail to answer milord
Wolfingham's summons?
I was in the castle at the appointed time, your grace, but I had an accident.
An accident?
Well, perhaps not exactly an accident.
I lost something to which
I was quite attached.
Captain Thorpe,
I dispatched a castle guard to bring you here.
Thank you, milord.
That was very kind of you.
The escort was really not necessary.
I know my way here very well.
Captain Thorpe, I have a more serious charge preferred against you.
His excellency, Don Alvarez, ambassador to this court, states that you did attack, plunder, and sink the Galea Santa Eularia, on which he was a passenger under the flag of protection of his sovereign, king Phillip of Spain.
Is this charge true?
Part of it, your grace.
Quite a large part of it.
Part of it?
Well, what's the rest?
We also set free many Englishmen imprisoned as galley slaves on his excellency's ship.
Your grace, these men referred to by Captain Thorpe were duly tried and sentenced to the galley by a qualified court.
I submit, your grace, that the court of the inquisition is not qualified to pass fair judgment on English seamen, nor to subject them to the cruelties of a Spanish galley.
Aye! Aye!
Your grace, it appears the captain wishes to justify what in plain words, is a desire for plunder with no respect for the interest of Spain.
The interests of Spain do not command my respect as they evidently do his lordship.
Your majesty, I protest!
Captain Thorpe, at least show proper respect for my ministers!
And so you have taken it upon yourself to remedy the defects of Spanish justice.
Insofar as it lies within my power, yes, your grace.
And you conceive it to be part of your mission to assault and loot the ship of an ambassador to the court.
Captain Thorpe, do you imagine that we are at war with Spain?
Your grace, Spain is at war with the world.
Aye!
Enough of this.
Listen to me, every one of you!
Never again will you dare in my presence to condone your crimes under the mask of patriotism!
No more of such talk, do you hear?
And for the future, let me warn you that any unwarranted attack upon the person or property of Spanish subjects will cost the guilty party his head!
His head, is that clear?
Now you may go.
No, not you, Captain Thorpe.
I'm not finished with you.
Captain of the guard, you will accompany captain
Thorpe to my private chamber where he will wait my further pleasure.
Don Alvarez, you may convey my regrets to his majesty king Phillip and assure him that this unhappy incident will have no recurrence.
My humble thanks, your grace, and may I also inform him that the offender in this instance will be forced to make full restitution?
You will tell him exactly what I told you to tell him.
Nothing more.
So that's where you've been.
What do you mean by running away from me and keeping me late for my appointment?
I've got a good mind to pull your tail for you.
It's very ungrateful of you.
Do you realize how few monkeys have a chance to live in a palace?
No, that's wrong, come to think of it.
There's quite a few of you here already.
However, after this you watch your manners.
And if your mistress happens to take a fancy to you, just put in a good word for me.
I think I'm going to need it.
Well, what's your excuse this time?
My small friend from Brazil was so anxious to pay his respects to your grace, that he selected his own method.
Evidently more anxious than you whan he paid my court an earlier visit.
That's where he was.
I was looking for him, your grace.
That's why I was late.
Why on earth did you bring him here?
I thought he might amuse milady, which is more than
I could hope to do.
He looks like
Wolfingham.
It is him.
Indeed, the smile exactly.
He's very friendly, madam.
He won't harm you.
You're a rascal, like your former master, but I'm fond of rascals.
Some of them.
This is the nearest we have to a tree.
Behave yourself.
And now to...
Captain Thorpe?
For you, madam.
As soon as I saw it,
I thought immediately of you.
I see the light in it, like a candle in a frosted window.
A west Indian Pearl, is it not?
Yes, madam.
By some mischance it was on its way to Spain when I, diverted it.
You might say
I came between
Phillip and the oyster.
I fear Wolfingham is right.
You are an incorrigible pirate.
No, madam.
But I do have a conscience about pearls.
They should only be worn by one whose throat matches their own luster.
And have you any other scruples?
One only, madam...
That is never willfully to displease you.
But have you?
I trust not, but one can be mistaken.
Well, I should not advise you to make a practice of...
Diverting Spanish ambassadors.
The ambassador's galleass was already propelled by English oars, madam.
I merely substituted with English sails.
Captain Thorpe, we have moral rights on our side.
Spain has the law on hers.
Bear that in mind in your future ventures.
Yes, madam.
Now to business.
I understand your voyage was very profitable.
Unusually so, madam.
An inventory of the treasure, with the crown's share at your disposal.
Excellent. I shall put it to good use.
If what I've done has pleased your grace,
I have a favor to ask.
Well?
That our contributions induce you to begin work on the fleet.
Fleet! Fleet! Must I listen to that from you, too?
The armada, your grace.
Are you so sure that
Phillip will attack?
Have you any assurance that he won't?
Captain Thorpe, with all the contributions of the sea hawks, we cannot possibly match
Phillip's vast resources.
Our safety lies in diplomacy, not force.
Madam, suppose Phillip's vast resources, or at least a large portion of them, were not to reach him, were to be, shall I say, diverted?
What then?
Just what is going on in that piratical mind of yours?
Your grace, the lifeblood of Spain lies in her new world treasure.
Within 3 months, a year's plunder in gold leaves Panama bound for Spain.
With 10 good privateering ships...
No! I forbid it.
A concerted attack on the gold fleet would be regarded by Phillip as an overt act of war, which even I could not explain away.
Very well, madam.
Let it be a single enterprise. One ship.
The albatross with a picked crew.
Impossible. A Spanish convoy would overwhelm you.
On the sea, yes, but I have a different plan, your majesty...
Attack them on land, as they robbed the
Aztecs and the Incas.
The treasure's stored in Panama near the inland city of Ventacruz.
From there it's taken by mule caravan to the coastal town of nombre de dios, a distance of 60 leagues.
Look you, madam, with your permission.
My plan is to sail down into the Caribbean from the north...
I'll meet fewer
Spanish ships that way.
Anchor the albatross in some secluded inlet here, land my men and supplies.
We can camp in the hills until I find out from the natives when the caravan begins moving.
Now, from nombre de dios to Ventacruz, this strip here...
Is jungle so thick and dense that a small force could attack from ambush.
Madam, our plunder would be the richest prize ever brought back to England.
Could such a plan possibly succeed?
It would have one chance of success if the Spanish were taken by complete surprise.
Have I your permission to try, madam?
Captain Thorpe, if you undertook such a venture, you would do so without the approval of the queen of England, but you would take with you the grateful affection of Elizabeth.
Then, madam, I shall take with me that which I prize above all things.
Don't you think, my dear, we could manage with what we have?
Um, I'd like a few more.
Look, Martha.
Don't you think this one is pretty?
Very pretty, but you've quite a lot just like it.
There's a different species over here.
It's a little darker, you see?
I see.
What is it?
Nothing.
What are you thinking about?
I was just thinking about our voyage.
I must say prefer English boats to Spanish boats.
There's more air on them.
Ooh! You must excuse me, my dear.
It's time for me to go.
You better take these.
Mar...
Martha!
Don't go, Martha!
No, no, no, no!
Martha, wait for me.
Don't leave me!
Martha!
May I help you?
Thank you.
You... You seem to be very fond of English roses.
My mother told me about your rose gardens.
She was English.
That explains a great deal.
But I prefer the Spanish Iris.
Naturally.
It has no thorns.
Captain Thorpe,
I didn't get a chance on the boat, but I want to thank you for returning my jewels.
I'm so sorry for what I said about your robbing women.
And, well, if you think it would do any good,
I'd be glad to speak to the queen, to tell her how kindly you treated us and that we don't want to have you punished.
That's very kind of you, indeed.
I think I can stand the punishment, but I'm very grateful for your concern.
I wonder if you can imagine how much it means to me.
No. I haven't any notion.
When I saw you first,
I thought you were like a statue, beautiful but cold.
Then I watched you when you saw the slaves, and the statue seemed to come to life.
I thought perhaps you'd forgive me one day.
Captain Thorpe,
I have forgiven you.
Is... Is forgiveness all you feel?
Well, have I led you to believe anything else?
Not by anything you've said, but I thought I saw something in your eyes.
No. You're...
You're mistaken.
I'm sorry.
You're...
You're mistaken.
Well, perhaps that's as well since I'm going back to sea.
What?
We'll be gone quite some time.
Are you leaving soon?
Within a week or so, just as soon as the albatross is ready.
The roses look different when you hold them.
Doña María, in the garden of a convent in Peru, there's a beautiful statue.
The nuns call it nuestra señora de las Flores.
That's how I'll always think of you, as milady of the roses.
Where are you bound, mate?
Ha ha!
Blessed if I know.
Pass it along here.
You taking on any sailors?
You'll have to see Mr. Pitt, top of the gangplank.
Right.
Hey, lieutenant, here's another one coming up to sign on.
Pass it along, here, boys.
Come along, please!
Mr. Pitt will assign you your duties and quarters.
Aye, aye.
Michael Sweeney, and I'll give you my best, sir.
Jones, sign him.
Thank you, captain.
Well, tuttle,
I didn't expect to see you back so soon.
I'm a sailor, captain.
And a right good one.
Just the kind we need on a trip like this.
Report to Mr. Pitt on the upper deck.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Next.
Eli matson.
What are you doing on board here?
Captain, if you don't mind my asking, but I suppose after what I done, there ain't no place for me on the albatross?
I might find a berth for you as a cabin boy.
There's always a berth for a good man, Eli, particularly one who's learned to obey orders.
Captain, there ain't no man
I'd rather serve under.
I'll make it up to you.
Thank you, sir.
See you do. Name?
Kroner, captain.
Samuel kroner.
Topman, first-class.
- Age?
- Last vessel?
- The Dorsey, sir.
Papers?
I didn't bring them with me, sir.
I wasn't ready to sign till I knew where you were shipping.
You weren't?
Don't a man have a right to know what he's signing on for, captain?
Not on board this ship he hasn't.
My men follow without questions.
Get ashore. Next.
Aye, sir.
And I said to myself,
"this isn't the usual preparation.
This voyage is something different."
That's all I could find out, your lordship.
Not a man in his crew knows where he's going.
Kroner, Thorpe's destination is of vital importance.
We'll have him watched from now until the day he sails.
Money will be placed at your disposal by my steward.
Very good, your lordship.
Then this pirate is free again to plunder where he chooses in spite of the queen.
Or perhaps for the queen.
Hereafter, we shall do better to rely on our own devices than on the assurances of a clever woman.
Surely she would not neglect to inform her lord chancellor of the nature of such an important voyage.
Her grace did inform me that Captain Thorpe is undertaking a trading expedition up the Nile, and I pretended to believe her.
Does that reassure your excellency?
Forgive me, milord, if any suspicion crossed my mind.
His majesty, king Phillip, has implicit confidence in your loyalty to his interests.
His gracious majesty and I have an interest in common...
A ruler friendly to Spain on the throne of England.
Like you, lord Wolfingham?
Don Alvarez, we serve others best when at the same time we serve ourselves.
Sure you have enough information on these waters?
Every bay and inlet for harboring a ship, sir, with soundings accurate, and not a reef missing.
Good. That's what I want.
I'll send for it on Wednesday.
I'll have it ready for you, sir.
You can rely on me.
By the way, I don't want any printing on the chart.
Do you understand?
No names at all.
No names.
Very good, sir.
Good day.
Good day,
Captain Thorpe.
I'll have it ready for you Wednesday.
How do you do, gentlemen?
Are you the chartmaker?
At your service.
I am lord Wolfingham.
This is Don Alvarez de Córdoba, ambassador from king Phillip of Spain.
I am honored, your excellency and milord.
I've been boasting to his excellency about English chartmaking.
I'm anxious for him to see samples of your work, perhaps some charts you are in process of making.
Certainly, sir.
Would his excellency prefer to see navigation charts or maps?
The charts, if you please.
My government may wish to compare them with their own.
Very good, sir.
If you will notice, sir, all my charts are drawn on the very best parchment and mounted on the finest linen.
The numbers every 1/2 inch along the coastline indicate the depth of the ocean in fathoms at that point.
This is very interesting.
I just finished that one as you gentlemen came in.
Here is a section of the west coast of Africa.
You will notice it is worked out with such detail that a navigator can sail his ships through waters unknown with perfect safety.
Yes, indeed.
Excellent work.
Here are some straits.
Tricky to navigate, and if I may say so, tricky to chart.
What do the figures of the constellations at the top of the map signify?
Purely a decoration, milord.
I take the constellation that has its zenith over the charted territory.
Every seaman knows them, just like the Southern cross over these straits of Magellan.
Merely a conceit of mine so that people may recognize my work.
Quite an original idea.
Thank you, sir.
This figure with the dagger pointing down is Orion the hunter, is it not?
Yes, your excellency.
Then your excellency has some knowledge of astronomy?
Not as much as I should like to have.
They say that even our fortunes rest with the stars.
You see, gentlemen, the orbit of Orion is approximately this narrow path between the equator and the 10-degree parallel.
The constellation appears to move overhead as the earth turns on its axis.
Obviously, the section of land you are seeking must be somewhere on this belt.
And from your memory of the chart, it appears, this strip is too long to be an island, not large enough to be a continent.
Therefore, we may deduce it is an isthmus.
Now, the only isthmus running east and west under Orion's orbit is this connecting link between the two continents of the new world.
Gentlemen, here is your charted strip of land...
The isthmus of Panama.
50 sacks of rice,
50 pounds of raisins,
30 pounds of cocoa,
18 hogsheads...
18 hogsheads of vinegar,
50 jars of wine.
Thank you, Mr. Pitt.
Now, I have some rather urgent business in London, so you'll take charge.
Isn't that rather a sudden decision, Captain Thorpe?
No, no. It's...
Just what are you grinning at, Mr. Pitt?
Well, I couldn't help thinking to meself that if I were going to London,
I'd certainly make it a point to see Miss Latham.
Blast if I wouldn't.
I daresay you would.
As a matter of fact,
I have an appointment, only she doesn't know it yet.
Thank you, gentlemen.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, captain.
Hello, gentlemen. Is
Captain Thorpe in his cabin?
That he is, sir John, and he'll be pleased to see you, sir.
- I thank you.
- Thank you.
This way, sir.
Sir John.
It seems that
I'm just in time.
You're looking very fit.
Thank you, sir.
Are you going ashore?
Yes. I was just going off to London.
We don't sail until next week, you know.
Well, that's what
I came to see you about.
You couldn't sail sooner, could you?
Why, yes...
If there was some reason for it.
There is, captain.
A very good reason.
I've a message from her majesty the queen.
She'd like you to set sail immediately.
There are certain members of her court that are asking too many questions about your latest trading expedition up the Nile.
I see.
Very well, sir John.
I'll not go to London.
And will you please inform her majesty we sail with tomorrow's tide?
You're feeling very happy, uncle.
What?
Yes.
Yes.
Have you had good news?
Excellent news.
Is it a secret?
You wouldn't be interested, my dear.
Excuse me.
Mr. kroner to see you,
Don Alvarez.
Have him come in,
Miss Latham.
Your excellency.
Doña María.
You have news from milord?
Aye. The best possible news.
Captain Lopez sailed this morning.
He'll get to Panama before Captain Thorpe.
Please congratulate his lordship and convey my best wishes.
Thank you, señor.
María.
Well...
The English pirate has plundered his last ship.
Uncle, what will they do to him?
Piracy is punishable with death.
Or if Spain is disposed to be lenient, there's the galley.
Martha!
What's wrong, my dear?
Order me a carriage and fast horses.
My child!
I'm going to Dover.
Yes, yes. I'll order it at once, dear.
Can you reach Dover tonight?
With a change of horses, yes, milady.
As quickly as possible, please!
Yes, milady.
Not a word to my uncle.
Do not worry about that, my dear.
And if you see that big ruffian Carl, give him my felicitations, not that he will know what it means.
Drive on.
3:00 and all's well!
3:00 and all's we...
Can I help you, milady?
Is that the albatross?
Yes, milady.
Sailed this evening on the ebb tide.
Is there anything
I can do?
No, thank you.
3:00 and all's well!
Set your course west-southwest.
Captain Thorpe has arrived, señor.
An inlet 10 miles west of nombre de dios.
So, for once, they send me an accurate report and on time.
Your orders, general.
You will leave with a small escort for nombre de dios at sundown as scheduled.
But the English will attack.
And you will offer no resistance.
Captain Thorpe came a long way for this gold.
We must not disappoint him.
Lieutenant...
You have seen the jungle orchid.
It is a very attractive flower that holds out its yellow pollen, but once an insect is lured within its petals, they close like this.
We're on the right track, captain.
I got it from a native.
They hate the Spanish worse than we do.
Near as I could figure his lingo, the gold train leaves
Ventacruz at sundown...
About 20 mules in all.
How far would you say
Ventacruz was from here?
About 20 miles, captain.
It'll take a mule train most of the night.
Good. Then we'll all have time for some sleep after we set out the ambush.
Now, men, you'll spread out along this trail at intervals of about 10 yards.
Burke, I'm going to station you at the rear.
That's a very responsible position.
You'll give a signal on your whistle when you see the last man and mule pass,
- do you understand?
- Aye, sir.
And you all know what to do, men.
Aye, sir.
Now, I'll stay at this point.
Mr. Pitt, you're across from me.
Mr. Scott, next place down the line and so on.
Men, you better all pick out your nests before dark.
Aye, aye, sir.
It's too thick in there.
You can't see what's in it.
Full of snakes and crocodiles, I'll wager.
They say there's plants with arm's length that'll strangle a man if he ain't careful.
Stop that talk, Ben, or you'll be seeing ghosts before you see
Spaniards.
It's a funny thing about sailors, you know.
They don't mind the fight if they can see what they're fighting.
But you take a mosquito, now...
What were you saying about mosquitoes?
There's a whole nest of them here.
The beasts have ears.
Try holding your breath, Mr. Pitt, and then they won't trouble you.
Better?
No. I'd rather have the Spaniards.
Hold it longer.
Dismount, please.
Disarm him,
Mr. Pitt.
Aye, aye, sir.
Down the line,
Scott.
See if everything's in our hands.
Aye, aye, captain.
This is an outrage.
It shall be reported to his majesty king Phillip.
The news may be a little delayed in reaching his majesty, sir, since I must ask you to remain my prisoner.
Under protest, captain Thorpe!
So you know my name.
Why, yes, señor.
Everyone in Spain knows your name and respects it.
I'm flattered, but I must warn you against making any false moves, sir, or my men will be forced to shoot you.
Mount, if you please.
Up.
Looks like it's come pretty easy, captain.
Yes. A little too easy.
They all disarmed, Scott?
Aye, captain.
One thing more, sir...
If we should happen to meet anyone along this trail, this is your caravan, and we're part of your escort.
You understand?
Pass the word, cross.
Everything ready to move.
Aye, aye, sir.
Ready to move!
Move up, men.
Quietly now.
Move on, men.
Forward, men.
Fire.
Get back! Back!
Take cover!
Quick!
It's a trap, and no mistake, sir.
Into the swamp! Quick!
Out of the swamps!
No one can live in there.
Let's get out of here.
Let's get out of here.
It's too hot.
It's too bloomin' hot!
It's too hot.
It's too bloomin' hot.
They're not following.
We can rest here.
Let me see that arm, tuttle.
It's in me chest, captain.
A bit of musket lead.
Well, we'll get that out when we get back to the ship.
Yes, sir.
How did the Spanish know we were here?
That's what
I can't fathom.
We'll find out someday.
Wonder if the others got through, captain.
Well, if they did, they'll head for the ship.
Well, lads, we'd best be moving.
You'll never get there with me, captain.
Why, of course we will, William.
Feel that breeze?
That's from the sea.
We're on the shore.
The sea!
Stand back.
It's hard news to carry back.
They'll be wondering to see only the one boat coming.
Some of them might get through yet.
Mightn't they, captain?
It's a miracle any of us are here, Burke.
I can't see the lookout.
They didn't expect us so soon.
It's funny they haven't posted a lookout.
Maybe there's one behind the chart house.
We couldn't see him from here.
I hope they haven't broken into the ale closet.
I could do with a mug.
If the chaps ain't drunk it all up.
All I'd like to do is sleep for a thousand years.
Here's one got ahead of you.
Captain...
He ain't never going to wake up.
He wanted to go back to the sea.
Have you sighted anyone on the boat yet, captain?
Not a bloomin' soul.
You might give them a hail, Mr. Scott.
We'll need their help when we get there.
Ahoy there!
Ahoy, mates!
Give us a hand.
You lubbers, show your faces!
It's the captain.
Do you hear me?
It's the captain!
What are the fools hiding for?
I don't like it.
Something's wrong.
No more of that, or I'll have to...
Steady, Mr. Pitt.
Now ship your oars.
Make fast.
You stay in the boat, Burke.
Aye, sir.
Welcome,
Captain Thorpe.
I advise you not to resist.
Those muskets are in the hands of excellent marksmen,
I assure you.
Besides, captain...
It's my turn to entertain you.
I regret it has to be on your ship, but you will understand the necessity.
If you draw that sword, captain, we shall not have the pleasure of taking you and your men back to Spain... Alive.
Your prisoners, captain.
Item 37...
Looted by sorcery and other heretical practices, then tried to enter secretly by night the Spanish city of Cartagena and did capture the Garrison and force the governor thereof to pay a ransom in the amount of 30,000 ducats.
Item 38...
You did also attack his majesty's galleass
Madre Delores at Valparaiso and did seize gold in the amount of 8,000 pounds,
13 chests of coin silver, and 1,770 jars of wine.
Item 39...
You did also loot and sink the galleass
Santa de olalia Del Monte in the English channel, profaning his majesty in the person of his ambassador.
In summary of these offenses, our records show you did plunder 7 cities in the empire of Spain and did destroy
47 of his majesty's vessels.
Captain Thorpe...
Do you confess to the truth of these charges?
Your records do us an injustice.
They should read
9 cities and 54 vessels.
You will amend the charges in accordance with the defendant's statement and place his confession on record.
Captain Thorpe, as judged, you will be handed over to the military authorities under whose direction you will be chained to the oars of a galley in servitude for the rest of your natural lives.
Captain Thorpe...
But perhaps we'd better dispense with the "captain" under the circumstances.
It isn't often that we have the pleasure of entertaining so famous a pirate in our galley.
I hope that you find our hospitality all that you anticipated.
No doubt we shall.
You Spanish have a gift for hospitality when your guests are in chains.
We're getting underway.
You'll start the oars at 10 beat.
Aye, aye, captain.
Drop your oars in the water!
Now pull, you
English mongrels!

Beautiful...
But are all Spanish songs so sad, my child?
Only those that speak of love, your grace.
You speak of it eloquently, my dear.
I daresay each of us must choose between loving a man or ruling him.
I prefer to rule.
I don't quarrel with your choice, maría.
You have your song, and I have my scepter.
But now sing us one that is gay.
Well, Don Alvarez, is your business so urgent that it must intrude upon my few moments of diversion?
Your grace...
I have just had a communication from Spain that I feel sure will command your interest.
It concerns the privateer of Geoffrey Thorpe.
Well, what about him?
While attempting a raid on the Panama treasure caravan, he was captured by Spanish troops and is now a condemned prisoner on one of his majesty's galleys.
Why, child...
I'm all right, uncle.
Your pardon, majesty.
Say no more, my dear.
I quite understand.
You may take maría to her rooms and stay with her as long as she needs you.
My thanks, your grace.
You may go, all of you.
Don Alvarez, it appears your news concerns your niece more than it does me.
Your grace, I would have spared her had I known.
Your arrow hit the wrong mark.
As for myself,
I regret
Captain Thorpe's fate, because he is a brave man.
But he is a privateer, and...
Privateers must take their own risks.
Then, your grace,
I must speak bluntly.
My sovereign is not convinced that Captain Thorpe risked so much merely for his own gain.
No? Then perhaps you can suggest a more likely motive.
Your grace will recall that she released Thorpe after his attack upon my ship and that on the heels of this offense, she allowed the albatross to sail, presumably to trade in Egypt.
Well, am I to be held accountable for Captain Thorpe's change of mind?
Your grace, Thorpe never intended any project but the one he undertook, although by now, he might wish he had.
You weary me with your implications.
Come to the point.
I regret that the point is not an agreeable one.
From these circumstances
I mentioned, my sovereign is forced to infer that Captain Thorpe had the approval of your majesty in an overt act of war upon the empire of Spain.
Don Alvarez!
Do you question my word?
Unfortunately, your grace, my government cannot reconcile your words with the acts of your subjects.
Then let Phillip infer what he pleases.
I will not be held accountable to Phillip for my actions or for those of my people!
In that case,
I'm instructed to serve official notice upon your majesty that the honor of Spain requires that you will immediately disband and imprison the sea hawks or...
Face the consequences of an open conflict between our two nations.
What are you saying?
Do you dare come to me with threats?
Out of my court before
I order your arrest!
Remove that man's portrait from my sight!
Hurry! Do as I say!
Go to lord Wolfingham.
Tell him to summon my council at once.
It's enough that
I've had to listen to his tiresome complaints without having to look at his arrogant face!
"The honor of Spain requires..." requires, indeed!
Presumptuous fool!
Telling me what I can do and what I can't do, as if the world were a Jewel that hung around his neck.
Has Phillip gone completely mad?
Does he think he can dictate to the queen of England?
Who's to defend us but the sea hawks?
Your majesty, we cannot afford an open break with Spain.
What makes you think we will be attacked?
What other reason has Phillip for building an armada?
But, your grace, these demands are preposterous.
These men are loyal and devoted.
In what way have they offended but in serving their country?
Spain seeks to strip you of your one defense upon the seas.
Sir John, we need defense only if we are attacked.
To disregard
Phillip's warning is to invite an immediate war.
While to heed it is to throw ourselves at his mercy.
And what of that?
He has too many concerns elsewhere to bother about us.
Milord, I believe that
Phillip's thirst for power can only be quenched in the English channel.
Even if that were true, are my lord admiral and his privateers prepared to stop him?
We are ready to try, my lord, to the last ship and to the last man.
If Phillip is bold enough to make demands now, what will he do when the armada is built?
My lords, I have considered your opinions earnestly.
My own impulse, like sir John's, is to defy Phillip.
But the safety of my subjects constrains me to caution.
Lord Wolfingham, you will prepare an order authorizing the arrests of all English privateers...
And the confiscation of their ships as they put into port.
That will be all, my lords.
My friend, there are times when a queen must think not of right or wrong, but only of the good of those she rules.
My child.
You mustn't weep so.
There may yet be some hope.
What chance is there for a galley slave?
But at least he is still alive, maría.
Alive?
Like animals in a dark cage.
No air, no sun, no kindness, no mercy.
Only time and torture.
The hours as heavy as their chains.
Martha, better he were dead than down there waiting only to die.
María.
I'm sorry.
And what good will that do now?
I'll never forgive you.
My child, I only did what I had to do.
What I feel towards you
I'll have to feel for the rest of my life.
María, you're very young.
Time will make you feel differently.
Only one thing will make any difference.
Uncle, if we could go to Spain and plead with the king.
There's no chance?
For any other man, perhaps.
Not Captain Thorpe.
Captain Mendoza, important dispatch.
Very well. I'll see that they reach the Madre de dios before she sails from Cadiz.
On deck!
4 prisoners assigned to your galley, sir.
We'll put them to good use.
Keep them in irons.
Back to your oars!
We're getting underway!
Drop your oars in the water!
Cross is dead, Mr. Pitt.
Wake up, you!
Pull on that oar!
Do you hear me?
I'm tired of your tricks!
He's dead.
Hello, guard!
Captain Thorpe?
I didn't know you at first. I'm Abbott.
- Abbott.
- Yes.
Mark your beat!
Sir John sent me to Spain.
I was taken in Madrid.
The armada... moving against England soon.
Sir John wanted proof to convince the queen.
But Hawkins, Frobisher, the rest of the sea hawks...
Do they know?
They're all in prison or hiding by orders from Spain.
The queen did it to avert war.
The armada. Did you find the proof?
The papers are aboard this ship being taken to the Madre de dios in Cadiz.
They had me before
I could get them.
They were informed.
The same thing in Panama.
Pitt...
Pass the word.
Everyone stop when I stop.
Refuse to start.
Aye, aye, sir.
Stop when the captain stops.
Stop when you get the word.
Stop when you get the word.
Aye, sir.
The wind has slackened, and we must reach Cadiz before the Madre de dios sails.
Can't you raise the beat?
They can't row above
18 for long, sir.
What time does the
Madre de dios leave Cadiz?
Before morning, that's all I know, and we can't risk missing her.
What's happening?
We're slowing down.
The timekeeper's asleep!
Find out what's wrong!
Aye, aye, captain!
Pick up the beat!
Pick up the beat!
What are you sitting there for? Bend over!
Bend over!
Turn around and row!
Pick up the beat!
Pick up those oars!
Pick up those oars!
Rebel, will you?
Pick up your beat!
Thorpe, this is your work.
When we make Cadiz,
I'll have you hung!
Now pick up your oars and put your backs to it!
Timekeeper, raise the beat to 18!
Aye, aye, sir.
Captain Ortiz has been expecting you.
Thank you.
Now, men, you all know what to do.
- Aye!
- Aye!
You men follow me.
The rest of you stand guard.
Aye, aye, sir.
It appears, captain Cortiz, that you and the Madre de dios will be paying the last official visit to England.
The last friendly visit, shall we say?
Exactly. I can't say that I envy your commission, to sail alone into the port of the enemy.
It is my privilege to fetch home the ambassador before we strike.
Besides, England isn't an enemy until she knows she is.
True.
Luckily for us, she'll only know that when the armada appears in the channel.
And when will that be, captain?
According to the information which I am carrying to lord Wolfingham, the armada is almost ready to sail against England.
Odd.
What is it?
The breeze must have freshened.
We're swinging at anchor.
Yes, I can feel the drift.
Well, we'd better let you turn in, captain.
When does the crew come aboard?
They have leave till 4:00.
We sail at dawn.
Bon voyage, captain Ortiz.
Bon voyage.
Thank you, but I look forward more eagerly to our next voyage to England.
Gentlemen, I drink to the success of the armada.
- The armada!
- The armada!
To the armada.
Into the tops, men.
We're getting underway.
Aye!
Man the helm, Abbott.
Fox, at the foresail!
Matson, up with the main!
Aye, sir.
Mr. Pitt, the mizzen.
- Aye, sir.
- Aye, sir.
Aloft there!
Clear your leash line!
Clear away your mizzen vanes!
Heave taut your halyard!
Slack away your true lines!

Your passport, please.
Here.
Very good, your excellency.
Sorry to have stopped you.
We're taking precautions against the privateers, sir.
Drive on!
María, there's still time to reconsider.
I can hold the boat at Dover while we send for your things.
No, uncle.
I've made up my mind.
I'm staying here.
But if trouble should come between our country and England, your position here may become very difficult.
I'm as much English as Spanish.
Maybe more.
Is that the reason, maría?
I can't go back to Spain as long as there's any hope.
Uncle, let's not talk about it anymore.
I'll be lonely and homesick, but I know I'd be lonely wherever I am.
Up oars!
Now, remember, as soon as
Don Alvarez comes down, tell him in Spanish you'll take him out to captain Ortiz.
Do you understand?
What shall we do when we get him aboard?
Nothing. Just hold him until further orders.
What about you, captain?
How will you get to the queen?
I don't know.
Now off with you, lads.
Quick as you can to the landing.
- Aye!
- Aye!
Doña María, excelencia, a sus ordenes.
Good-bye, uncle.
Good-bye, maría.
May you find your happiness.
I... I'm sorry.
I thought you might cry out.
Geoffrey.
I... i saw your carriage waiting, and...
I couldn't help it.
Where did you come from?
How did you get here?
On the ship that came for your uncle.
But... but you, why aren't you going with him?
He's going to Spain.
And you're staying here?
Why?
Don't you know why?
Ever since that day you went away,
I've... I've been in torment thinking something might happen to you and you'd never know, and then it did happen, and I've never forgiven myself until now.
I love you.
I've loved you ever since that day in the rose garden.
Only I kept it to myself then because I was...
I was too proud.
I'm not proud anymore.
Only... I can't believe
I found you again.
Geoffrey.
Can't you say something?
I'm sorry. I...
I don't seem to have any words.
María, there were times in Panama, in the galley, when I'd have given my life for one sight of you.
And now you're here, close.
I just can't realize it's all...
But I am here, and we're together.
Nothing's ever going to separate us again.
Not distance and not pride.
Not even a large bouquet of English roses.
Curse this fog.
It'll be late before we're in London.
You're still in danger.
That'll be over when
I get to the queen.
They're stopping everybody at London gate.
Looking for honest
English sailors.
Strange, but it never occurs to me anymore that I'm Spanish and you're English.
It doesn't seem important.
'Tisn't.
I know nothing about war and politics, but I believe in you, and whatever you do must be right.
Please let me help.
If I could only get into the castle without being recognized, I could...
I'll let you in my entrance.
Miss Latham's waiting up to let me in.
But the guards... as soon as
I step out of the carriage...
They'll just think
I'm smuggling in my lover.
After all, it's the truth.
Your pass?
We passed through early this evening taking his excellency the Spanish ambassador to Dover.
There's only his niece inside.
Can you identify yourself?
Yes, of course.
There's something the matter.
We're stopping too long.
I beg your pardon, milady,
I'll have to ask you to identify yourself.
Certainly.
They told me outside you were alone.
I'll have to see your papers, too, sir.
I just came in on the Madre de dios, officer.
I wasn't expecting to go out to London...
That's very unfortunate, but I'm sorry...
It was my uncle
Don Alvarez who sent him.
A special mission.
I'm sorry, milady.
My orders are...
That no one goes through this gate without a pass.
Officer, I'm on a special mission for lord Wolfingham.
Here.
See for yourself.
Very well, then.
Sorry to have delayed you.
Drive on!
When we get inside the grounds, drive straight to the guardhouse at the main entrance and drive fast!
Don't worry.
It'll be all right.
Geoffrey, darling.
I love you.
In the coach!
Officer of the guard!
In the coach!
Captain Thorpe! Arrest him!
Open the door!
Am I in some danger, officer?
Your pardon, Doña María, but I thought that...
What's the trouble, officer?
He isn't here.
Where is he?
There must be some mistake, sir.
He was in here when we entered the castle gate.
Doña María, where is
Captain Thorpe?
Captain Thorpe?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the man who rode with you in this coach from Dover to this castle.
By what right do you question me?
Guard, close the door.
Drive on.
Hyah! Hyah!
Officer, I want you to station guards at all entrances leading to the queen and order an immediate search of the castle grounds.
By whose authority,
Mr. kroner?
Lord Wolfingham's.
You'll have his written orders as soon as
I can report to him.
Just one moment, maría.
Captain Thorpe!
Inside, please!
Quick, please!
Search every corridor in the palace.
Sergeant, take your men and go through the left wing.
Now, mind you, Captain Thorpe is not to get to the queen.
Put him under arrest and take him to the north tower.
These are lord Wolfingham's orders.
Yes, sir.
This way, lads.
The rest of you men follow me.
Are you in danger?
- Until I see the queen.
- I'll help you.
There's a private corridor to the queen.
Good.
Captain Thorpe, did Carl come back?
Carl always comes back.
He's at Dover.
The door's straight ahead.
The first corridor to your left.
There.
Delay them as long as you can.
Well, what do you want?
We have an order to search your rooms.
Search our rooms?
What for?
I'm sorry, Miss Latham, but I can't take time to explain.
Either you open the door, or we break it in.
Break that door in, and the queen shall hear of it.
The queen will hear of it if we don't.
Very well.
Break it in.
Guards! Stop!
Have you 9 lives,
Captain Thorpe?
Surely, by now most of them must be used up.
I was expecting you, captain, but not alone, nor in a Spanish uniform.
You should be wearing it.
Perhaps I shall...
One day.
You have some dispatches for me, captain?
I have some dispatches for the queen.
I'm afraid
I shall have to ask you not to disturb her highness.
That's very thoughtful of you, milord, but I think she'll wish to be disturbed.
These dispatches bear the seal of Spain.
You won't be as lucky this time as at Panama.
Captain Thorpe!
Captain!
Stop it!
Stop it, I tell you!
Your majesty.
Lord Wolfingham.
One less enemy of England.
Read these, your grace.
Secret dispatches, from Phillip to Wolfingham.
Proof of their plans to send an armada against England.
Captain Geoffrey Thorpe.
In recognition of your Valiant services,
I pronounce you a knight of the realm.
Rise, sir Geoffrey Thorpe.
Accept by my hand the homage of your country and the gratitude of its queen.
- Hooray!
- Hooray!
And now, my loyal subjects, a grave duty confronts us all...
To prepare our nation for a war that none of us wants, least of all your queen.
We have tried by all means in our power to avert this war.
We have no quarrel with the people of Spain or of any other country, but when the ruthless ambition of a man threatens to engulf the world, it becomes the solemn obligation of all free men to affirm that the earth belongs not to any one man, but to all men, and that freedom is the deed and title to the soil on which we exist.
Firm in this faith, we shall now make ready to meet the great armada that Phillip sends against us.
To this end,
I pledge you ships...
Ships worthy of our seamen, a mighty fleet hewn out of the forests of England, a Navy foremost in the world not only in our time but for generations to come.
- Hooray!
- Hooray!
To England and the queen!
Your name please?
William Easter.
Mr. William Easter?
Right.
Your passport please.
Do I have to go through this rigmarole every time?
Regulations, sir.
Beastly nuisance I call it.
You'll receive your
American Visa in Lisbeon.
Will there be time?
Definitely.
- We've seemed to cut our time pretty close, Sir Henry.
- Ha?
Have you a word Sir Henry?
- Do you wish to make any comments, sir?
- Nothing at the present.
Sir Henry, what is your destination
New York or Washington?
I'm sorry,
I have nothing to say.
Sir Henry Marchmont official business.
Oh, Sir Henry Marchmont.
- Sir Henry.
- Thank You.
- Good luck, Sir Henry.
- Thanks, I may need it.
Shall I take your case, sir?
Definitely not.
- (talking all together)
- Sorry, gentlemen.
I say, you think the old boy carried the fate of the empire in that little black case.
Perhaps he does.
Times up, boys.
Roll it away. Lively now.
Hey just a moment, you are shy one passenger.
Hold on.
Wait a bit.
Wait I say.
- I've got passage.
- Yes. Your name sir?
Grayson's the name,
John Grayson, senior clerk
Farlow Nash and Farlow, solicitor of Chancery Lane.
You've got it all there.
Everything quite regular.
Sorry to delay you, missed the bus had to take a taxi.
- Fearful nuisance.
- Yes, sir. Hop aboard will you, we're late now.
Thanks.
Thanks awfully.
Sorry to delay.
- Thank you.
- Right, old boy. Put her away.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm awfully sorry.
It's quite all right.
I've no sense of balance, none whatever.
Thanks.
Clumsy of me.
No sense of balance.
That's what it is.
The effects of the inner ear,
I fancy.
And when I read that you were in route to
Washington, Sir Henry,
I just couldn't rest until I found you.
Now dear, when can you dine with us?
Very kind Mrs.
Jellison I'll put you first on my unofficial list.
Oh, I have a much better idea.
You must let me put you up during your stay.
- Thanks very much but--
- Washington is so crowded.
I'll put you in the blue room.
Come in.
Thank you, sir.
But if Sir Henry isn't the one who is?
I don't know.
But Sir Henry received a cable from London tipping him off.
It's up to us to find the real British agent before this train reaches Washington.
Yeah.
Whoever's got the document will be protected there.
If Sir Henry isn't carrying it...
I've got it.
Besides Sir Henry and myself only one man's come all the way from London.
A chap called Grayson,
John Grayson.
Well, then Grayson's are man.
Grayson's carrying the document while Sir Henry is being used as a decoy.
It's so old it's new.
When Grayson leaves the club car and goes to get his luggage that's our cue.
We know what to do, Easter.
Good.
That's Grayson standing at the bar, the little fellow.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Don't give it thought, brother.
I'm in politics,
I'm used to hard knocks.
I'm Henry Babcock,
Senator Babcock.
How do you do?
John Grayson.
Sit down, Grayson.
Have a glass of grape juice from my home state.
Used to know a man named
Grayson. Mighty fine man.
He was murdered.
Two grapes, George.
Fine, sir.
This book has got me all confused.
I do wish you'd set me straight on the international situation.
Rather large order I'm afraid.
Oh, you're so right, Sir Henry.
One must take the broader view I always say.
Another grape juice, Grayson, you can't have too many vitamins I always say.
Thanks, Senator but if you don't mind
I'll have a whiskey and soda.
Why sure.
- George, bring them over, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Let's get a chair.
I was built for comfort.
Solid little beggars.
Kept some myself as a lad, till mother got a cat.
Shh.
Don't say C-A-T.
Oh, sorry.
- Permit me, ma'am.
- Oh, thank you.
You're very kind, I'm sure.
Pardon me, sir.
Here we are.
Porter.
Yes, sir.
Are we on time?
Yes, sir. We'll be in
Washington in twenty-minutes.
By the way Grayson, what's your line?
Line?
Yeah, what business you in?
What's your racket?
Oh, I represent a
London legal firm.
Farlow, Nash and Farlow.
Farlow?
I used to know a man named Farlow.
No, no it was Marlow. Couldn't have been the same fellow.
No, I suppose not.
I've been making a tour of my state getting the opinions of the home folks.
Taking a lot of their ideas back to Washington.
I'd like to hear more of your activities, Senator.
Give me your address, sir and I'll have all my speeches mailed to you.
You're quite too kind, sir.
Sorry, I have no card.
Oh, porter.
Yes, miss?
Permit me.
Thank you very much.
Not at all.
I'll be at this address for the next week or so,
I hope.
Thank you.
I'll get my papers together.
Pleasant meeting, my friend.
Better look me up in Washington.
I'll just get my bag.
Thank you, thank you.
Oh, I forgot to pay George.
Excuse me, sir.
Everybody be calm.
Just a little blackout.
Keep your seats.
Don't get excited.
Just a little blackout.
Keep your seats.
Mice!
Oh, dear. All gone.
Peter!
- Peter.
- Nancy, darling.
I didn't dream you'd be able to meet me.
I got leave.
- Oh, darling, that's wonderful.
- Just three days.
Oh, that's awful.
We haven't a second to lose.
First thing I did--
- Was get this.
- Oh, darling.
This finger.
Well I haven't had much experience.
Look, day after tomorrow your aunt's giving us a reception until then you and I are going to be a couple of busy people.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Goodbye.
Who's your boyfriend?
You needn't worry.
He just lit a cigarette for me.
This is the BBC News Bureau broadcasting from London.
At this time we present our regular morning summary of the news.
A British subject has disappeared under curious circumstances.
John Grayson, senior clerk in the firm of
Farlow Nash and Farlow, solicitors, Chancery Lane, has not arrived at his firm's representatives in Washington.
Foul play is suspected.
Deplorable, simply deplorable.
It's the sort of thing that shakes your faith, by George.
I say, Holmes, shakes your faith in everything.
You alarm me, Watson.
I've never seen you affected by the news however startling.
Startling, my dear fellow, it's devastating.
Seen the scores?
The Navy got 428 for six wickets.
Against the Army at Lords.
May I draw your attention to the fact that really momentous things are happening in the world today?
I know all about that.
I'll get to them later on.
Excuse me.
- Mind my egg, old boy.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
With your consuming interest in the game
I'm surprised that you've changed your mind about running up to Lord's cricket grounds this afternoon.
Well, it can't be helped.
I had to put it off--
How did you know
I'd changed my mind?
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Invariably when you go to a cricket match you fill your flask with my best whiskey.
Just now I noted in passing that the flask was empty.
A single whiff informed me that it had been recently filled, obviously after filling it, you would pour the contents back into the bottle, therefore you would have changed your mind about a cricket match.
You amaze me, Holmes.
You're positively...amazing.
Come in, Mrs. Hudson.
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Holmes, there's a gentleman and he's very insistent.
Well I do declare, he followed me right up the stairs.
Didn't I ask you to wait?
My good woman, you may ask me to wait but not the British Empire.
Mr. Holmes,
I must talk to you immediately.
How are you, Mr. Ahrens?
That will be all now.
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.
My good woman indeed. Huh.
Ahrens?
I seem to know that name.
Don't tell me, my dear Watson, that you don't recognize
Mr. Ahrens of the home office.
Why yes, of course. I knew you the moment you came in.
- How are you, Ahrens?
- How do you do?
Did you see what the Navy did to the Army at Lords yesterday?
All right Watson, go on with your breakfast.
Bad show. 428/6 wickets.
Mr. Holmes, I am here on a matter of the utmost secrecy.
I assure you, Mr. Ahrens that Doctor Watson is the very sole of discretion.
Won't you sit down?
By the by, Watson please be so good as to keep tapping on the table with your knife.
Tapping on the table with a knife?
It will break the wavelength if by any chance there's a dictograph in the walls.
Oh, really?
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
You can stop now, Watson.
Well, Mr. Ahrens
I take it you have called on me in connection with the kidnapping of John Grayson in America last night.
Why yes.
Yes, exactly.
Grayson was carrying a document of a very confidential nature.
Indeed.
It's contents were of such great international importance that I am not at liberty to reveal them but if that document falls into the hands of the enemy,
I can only say it will be absolutely disastrous for this government and our allies.
For that reason we did not wish to transport it to Washington in the usual way.
So a regular King's messenger, Sir
Henry Marchmont, was dispatched.
- Not carrying the document of course.
- That's right.
- Sir Henry was the sort of--
- A decoy shall we say?
Precisely.
The document was actually entrusted to a reliable but insignificant man in our secret service.
On his arrival in Washington he was to make himself known to Sir Henry and deliver the document.
Now not even Sir Henry knew that this man, Pettibone, who traveled under the name of John Grayson, was the real messenger.
- Pettibone?
- Yes.
- Alfred Pettibone?
- Yes.
Good man.
None better.
I've worked with him often.
I hope you may be able to work with him again.
But he's completely disappeared, he's vanished, gone without leaving a trace.
I can see the possibility of serious ramifications in his disappearance.
Exactly.
So far we've been able to keep the knowledge of our loss from both the American and British public.
Holmes, you must retrieve that document before it can be used against us.
Of course the Washington Police have been notified of Grayson's disappearance but even they don't know that he was carrying the document.
Now, that's about all the detail
I'm at liberty to give you.
Well, if they've got Grayson, that is Pettibone,
- they must got the papers!
- Not necessarily, Watson.
It doesn’t follow because they got the man, they got the document.
What form is this document in?
It was typed on two sheets of legal paper.
Two sheets?
That's too bulky to swallow.
And dry, Watson, cheerfully dry.
Especially legal papers.
Well, whatever shape the document was in
I trust Pettibone to get rid of it before anyone could lay hands on him.
The document must be found before it falls into the hands of our enemies.
I'm here on behalf of
His Majesty's government who urges you to find it.
That means going to Washington, of course.
With all possible speed.
A bomber is waiting for you at Creighton.
- Goodbye, Doctor Watson.
- Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Ahrens.
- Goodbye, Holmes. Good luck.
- Thanks very much.
We're relying on you.
Well, Watson we're off to Washington at once.
America, I say that's exciting. I've never seen a game of baseball.
- Let's go and start packing at once--
- Presently.
First, I'd like to take a look at the home of Alfred Pettibone.
Come along, Watson.
Why Doctor Watson, what a surprise.
And Mr. Holmes, won't you come in?
Thank you.
I'm frightfully sorry but you've won't find my son in he's gone to Washington.
Some business or other.
Poor fellow I'm afraid that he'll never-- never get used to the climate over there.
Would you mind if we looked over your son's room?
- Why of course, it's upstairs.
- Thank you.
Some friends tell me it's very, very muggy, very sticky.
You'll find it's like
Philadelphia...
You'll find his room in a dreadful pickle, Mr. Holmes.
Quite messy he is.
If I so much as put my nose inside, as if I cared anything about his silly old collection.
This fellow, Pettibone, seems a curious sort of a fellow.
Sort of a collector of collections.
Postage stamps, military buttons, butterfly, oh, bugs, snapshots, all sorts of rubbish.
Yes, I shall write a monograph some day on the noxious habit of accumulating useless trivia.
Please be so good as to stop pacing, Watson.
You distract me.
All right, all right.
Unless I'm greatly mistaken, our friend Pettibone, did not carry two pages of legal paper when he left this room.
I wouldn't be too sure, Holmes.
Ashes are deceptive you know?
On the contrary, my dear, Watson.
The rag used on artificial documents leads an ash that is unmistakable.
Oh, do stop pacing!
I'm not pacing.
I haven't moved an inch.
I'm sorry, old fellow.
My error.
Must be Mrs. Pettibone, heavy woman, light on her feet.
Doesn't follow.
Our friend seems to be quite a camera enthusiast.
What's this?
Cook F/1.5, that's a very fast lens
F/3.5, and a Sommer.
Copying set up.
American match folders.
That's right, U.S.A.
Now why would Pettibone want
American match folders in his work?
And a microscope, most interesting.
What's this?
Watson this microscope was last used for examining microfilm.
I'm beginning to see the pattern.
It stopped now.
Did you know that the letters of our soldiers overseas are being photographed on microfilm so that one carrier pigeon can carry the equivalent of
18,000 letters?
Oh really?
We had a carrier pigeon in the last war.
- Back in 1915 belonging to the Brigade Signal Corp.
- Did you?
Yeah, the poor bird kept flying round and round in circles all day long.
Found out later on that it was cross-eyed.
Tragic thing.
Where are you going, huh?
Oh, dark room, huh?
This is what I was looking for.
This projector magnifies tremendously anything placed on the slide like this piece of microfilm.
Understand?
Can't say I do exactly, no.
Wait a minute.
I'll show you what he's photographed.
Well, it's that match folder.
Why did he want to photograph that for?
Probably to line up his equipment before he photographed the document.
- We got him, Watson.
- Oh, have we?
Yes.
Come along.
All is clear as mud to me.
Just as I thought, this document has been reduced to microfilm to make its concealment possible.
Alfred Pettibone is a most ingenious fellow.
A bulky document is obviously difficult to conceal but two pages of a state paper, photographed on microfilm, would be reduced to a size no larger than a stamp.
Slitting a match folder with this a...
With this razor blade.
Pettibone placed the now minute document inside, stuck it together again and there he had it.
An American match folder, rare in London but completely inconspicuous in the United States.
Do you mean to say were off to America just to look for a match folder?
It's a big country.
A big country, Watson and a small match folder.
Come along.
Did you find what you were looking for, Mr. Holmes?
Yes, thank you, Mrs. Pettibone.
By the by you haven't been up on the roof in the last twenty minutes have you?
Why no.
What made you think that--
- Well, we distinctly heard footsteps--
- Nonsense, Watson,
- it was the house settling.
- Gracious yes.
Such popping and groaning, we're quite used to it.
Thank you.
- Goodbye, Mr. Holmes.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Pettibone.
- Goodbye, Doctor Watson.
- Goodbye.
So sorry you missed Alfred.
I'll tell him the minute he gets back.
Gets back?
Oh yes, yes, yes of course.
Goodbye again, Mrs. Pettibone.
Just a minute, Watson.
That was no accident
I assure you, Watson.
Well, aren't you going to find out who did it?
Time's too precious now.
At least I know they've learned of my entry into the case.
They? Who are they?
The same group that took
Alfred Pettibone off the train on his way to Washington.
A group that will stop at nothing to get their hands on the document he carried.
Their leader is a clever, resourceful criminal who seems to have sources of information from everywhere.
That means a worldwide organization
- who'll stop at nothing, you say.
- Quite.
That's why we must get our bags and ourselves aboard that bomber without delay.
We're opposed by an adversary worthy of our best efforts.
At present he has all the advantages.
Even that of being only a merciless, nameless shadow.
Think of it, Watson, in a few hours we'll be flying out over the Atlantic.
We're flying over
New York, sir.
New York, eh?
Yes, sir.
We've been cleared by radio, nonstop Washington.
What is that book that so engrosses your attention, Watson?
A book on the quaint customs and manners of America.
We must be half way across and I've only got to page thirty-seven.
For your information, my dear fellow, we are now flying over
New York.
Flying over New York?
Good gracious me.
Extraordinary.
This is the embassy car,
Mr. Holmes.
You're being very helpful,
Mr. Lang.
Detective Lieutenant Grogan of the Washington Police.
- How do you do?
- Welcome to Washington.
Thank you. This is my associate
Doctor Watson.
- How do you do, sir?
- How are you?
I suppose I should say, how are you, buddy?
What's...what's cooking?
Oh, come along, Watson.
Oh, it says it here in the book.
Oh, what's cooking?
Grogan's in charge of investigating the Grayson case for the Washington Police.
Any new developments Grogan?
None, Mr. Holmes.
I'd be glad let you have our complete file and of course we'll cooperate in every way.
Thank you.
I shall appreciate your help, especially as I'm unfamiliar with your country.
Oh yes, of course, this is your first visit.
Oh, there's the
Lincoln Memorial.
Most impressive.
Oh, by the by, Mr. Lang, thank you for your cablegram.
I received it just before I left London.
Cable?
I sent no cable.
About our reservations at the Hotel Metropole.
Why no, we thought you'd stay at the Embassy of course.
Look at that.
Well, since some strange person has taken such an extraordinary interest in my welfare
I think I shall stay at the Hotel Metropole.
Oh, Mr. Holmes, there's the
Washington Monument.
There's the Capitol,
Mr. Holmes.
Magnificent.
- We're expecting you,
Mr. Holmes.
- Thank you.
I've questioned everybody known to have been in that club car, as a matter of course.
Sir Henry Marchmont confirms that Grayson had contact only with the people on this list.
Now he had a drink with
Senator Babcock and he chatted with a
Miss Pringle about some mice she had in a cage and then he picked up a book dropped by a Mrs. Jellison.
Not very much to go on.
How many of these people have been attacked already?
I've heard about your deductions, Mr. Holmes.
Well, Senator Babcock was held up on his way from the station but nothing taken.
Mrs. Jellison's home was ransacked that night.
And she found the book that she carried from the train literally torn to bits.
That's right.
Miss Pringle?
Miss Pringle said someone released the mice from the cage that during the night sometime and she found the cage torn apart.
What happened to the mice
I wonder?
An intriguing line of thought, Watson, but not essential to the case.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Apparently, Grogan, they're still looking for the document.
I'd very much like to have a look at that club car.
Well that will be easy,
- I had the car held on the side in the railroad yards.
- Good.
But we searched the car thoroughly, Mr. Holmes.
We couldn't find a thing.
What are you doing?
What's this?
Mr. Holmes your trunk.
Trunk?
I have no trunk.
It says right there.
"To Sherlock Holmes,
Hotel Metropole."
How was this trunk delivered?
An express man brought it, sir.
What's the name of the company?
Do you remember the license number?
Well, naturally I didn't notice that, I just signed for it.
All right, thank you, that'll do.
Well, this trunk's not locked.
Great Scott!
Poor chap.
- You recognize him,
Mr. Holmes?
- Yes.
Who was he?
The man were looking for,
John Grayson.
His real name is
Alfred Pettibone,
British Secret Service.
Why should they send the body here?
Obviously to frighten us.
Or, to tell us they know that
Sherlock Holmes is on the case.
Gentlemen, they knew we are on the case as early as their attempt on our lives in London.
They're much too intelligent to believe that a corpse would frighten a trained detective.
No, I rather think they intended this as a message and they wanted to be sure that I'd be here at the
Hotel Metropole to receive it.
Message?
What do you mean?
They want us to believe that they found the document and therefore have no further use for Grayson.
Well, if that's true then we're done for.
I'm not so sure that it is true, Watson.
If they have the document why are they wasting time sending me this?
No. It's an attempt to throw me off the track.
Grogan, you have a police laboratory of course?
Certainly.
I'll see what I can find out about the body.
Yes, whatever marks it reveals and the trunk.
A microscopic examination, everything about it, the lining, the blanket in which the body is wrapped, everything.
Let nothing escape.
We have the best police laboratories in the world,
Mr. Holmes.
I beg your pardon,
Lieutenant Grogan, you see I'm so accustomed to working quite alone at my lodgings on Baker Street that I sometimes forget the more modern scientific methods so particularly effective here in America.
Well, if there's anything there they'll find it, Mr. Holmes.
While you're doing that I'll take a look at the club car.
Coming, Watson?
Here we are, Mr. Holmes.
I have the porter as you asked and the railroad company's sent
Mr. Moore to unlock for us.
- Delighted.
- How do you do?
Very good, let's go in.
This way gentlemen.
Well.
It looks as if the police have made a thorough search.
Whoever did it, it wasn't the police.
There have been visitors here since our friend Grogan.
My goodness, look at our car.
Talk about a blitz.
I say Holmes, if Grayson hid anything in this car it certainly isn't here now.
Not necessarily, Watson.
If you will help me put this place in some kind of order.
Yes sir, boss.
This would go about here
I imagine.
Yeah.
That's it boss.
And, wait a minute.
Yeah, that's certainly more like it, yes sir.
Thank you. That will be all.
Watson, will you be
Mr. Grayson for a moment?
Grayson?
If you want me to, old man.
- What do you want me to do?
- You're having a drink at the bar.
Oh, drink, not a bad idea.
Drink at the bar.
Bring me a whiskey and soda will you Stewart?
Stewart?
Sorry Doctor Watson but the bar's closed.
He says the bar's closed.
According to Grogan's reconstruction of the scene, let me see...
Yes.
Grayson pauses at the bar while Senator Babcock moves across and sits down here.
Do you mind being Senator
Babcock for the moment, Watson?
Going up in the world.
Sit down please.
Now, Miss Pringle is seated there.
Over here, Watson.
Hmm?
Now I'm Miss Pringle?
That's right, the mouse woman.
Oh, the mouse woman.
Watson, over here please.
No, not there, not there, that's Senator Babcock.
Oh, pardon me, Senator.
Sit down please.
Now you're Mrs. Jellison.
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Holmes, he ain't Mrs. Jellison.
- He's the young lady.
- What?
Sir Henry Marchmont was sitting right here and Mrs. Jellison was right here.
She is sort of a big, fat lady.
What did Grayson do with her that attracted your attention so particularly to
Mrs. Jellison?
The little man he retrieved her book.
And the young lady sitting here?
Didn't she converse with the little man?
No, sir.
That young lady didn't have no converse with no one.
When the little man lit her cigarette she sat back and said,
"Thank you very much."
But you have matches here for your customers.
Oh yes, she called me and I saw her cigarette and I knew she wanted a match.
And Grayson used one of his own matches?
Well, uh--
Oh yes, he took a folder from his coat pocket.
Did he put the match folder back in his pocket or, did he give it to the young lady?
Why I don't remember,
I was fairly busy.
Try to remember!
Oh, if I should try till doomsday
I couldn't rightly say just what happened to that match folder.
- Oh yes, I remember just one important thing.
- What?
When the little man lit her cigarette he said something peculiar.
What was it?
He said, "Permit me."
Oh.
Well...
Well gentlemen, I'm extremely grateful to all of you.
It's all we can do for the present I think.
Since the place was torn to bits, after the murder of Grayson, the attacks on Senator Babcock,
Mrs. Jellison, Miss Pringle,
I'm convinced that the document left the club car long before these events but how?
By whom?
And who was the mysterious young lady whose cigarette
Grayson lighted?
Did anyone meet the young lady?
He sure did.
He, who's he?
Tall, handsome and in a uniform.
I see. I suppose you wouldn't remember what kind of a uniform?
I certainly would.
Lieutenant, Navy flyer.
My boy's in the Army,
- he's going to be a flyer too.
- Splendid.
Did you happen to hear them say anything?
Oh, I didn't happen I just couldn't help hearing it.
Well, what did they say?
Oh yes, they said they had three day leave, they had to move fast before the big party her Aunt was given them.
And then too he put a ring on her finger and they both looked mighty happy.
Just the way you look right now.
And the way I'm looking myself.
Come on, Watson.
That's the girl.
I curled her hair.
I could swear to it.
Is the address there?
All there.
Right in our laps.
And also right into the lap of Sherlock Holmes.
That's the least of our worries.
The head could handle ten like Holmes.
I hope so.
But don't underrate that Englishman.
I have several friends who did.
They now grace some of the best prisons in England.
Yes, sir?
I talked to the catering company it's quite all right.
They could hardly refuse me.
It's the Acton Company.
The Acton Catering Company.
Yes, sir.
I know what to do.
Pop over there.
You're going to work for the catering company?
Right.
When you get in the house find out all you can.
- Cady?
- Yes.
You're to go as a guest.
- Will it be safe?
- It will have to be.
I'll try and get in the girl's room.
Unless you hear from me carry on as we planned.
Oh.
Flash Gordon.
Seems a very capable fellow.
Sports pages, hmm.
These Brooklyn fellows seem to be arguing with the umpire.
Sorted thing.
What are you eating, Watson?
Gum.
Oh, put it away.
Never seen you take an interest in the society columns before.
It's a concern I'll drop at once I assure you, Watson.
Huh?
You find what you're looking for?
Well, how'd you know this is the girl?
It would be an extraordinary coincidence wouldn't it if more than one Naval lieutenant in Washington were to become engaged in the last few days to a girl from New York who's aunt was giving them the reception?
By Jove, you must be right.
She's a pretty girl.
Yes.
She's walking around with dynamite in her handbag.
635 Waldorf Place.
Who is it?
It's me Pete.
You can't come up here.
I did though.
One gets you two.
Ah, that party's going to be awfully dull after this.
Let's not go.
Let's go away and get married.
You've only got one more day.
That's an idea.
Nah, we can't do that to Anne.
I'll tell you, let's sneak a look at the new apartment.
It was awful sweet of Anne to give us the whole floor of this house for our apartment.
The least we can do is let her have the fun of showing it to us.
Okay.
Let's face the party.
I'll get my bag.
Thank you.
Oh, no you don't.
That's the way I got them.
Oh, how do you do?
So glad you come.
This is Mrs...
Oh dear, what is your name?
- Muxton.
- Of course I know it as well as my own.
- And this is Mrs. Vail.
- How do you do?
Isn't it?
Quite.
Oh, of course.
Any luck?
Not yet.
That must be Lieutenant Merriam and Miss Pattridge over there.
Certainly glad to hear the news, Pete. Congratulations.
Well, thank you, Major.
Thank you.
You're a lucky guy, Pete.
I'll see you later.
Third floor, first door.
Right.
I'll wait there you bring him up.
Thank you, sir.
A toast to the happy couple.
A toast.
Very good.
Happy landings.
- May I have one of those?
- Me too.
Thank you.
- Lieutenant Merriam?
- Hmm?
Telephone, sir.
Navy department calling.
Oh yes, be right back.
- Lead on McDuff.
- This way, sir.
Matches, match me darling.
Dig them up.
Thank you.
Oh, Pete hold it.
- You can keep them, Major.
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
- Not for me, thank you.
- No thank you.
Why up here?
They said it was private.
There's a phone in here, sir.
Hey it's my new apartment.
Miss Pattridge didn't want me to see it till after it was finished.
Here you are, sir.
Quite a smell of paint, sir.
In here, sir.
Thank you.
Okay now.
We should get some action,
Sir Henry, with Sherlock
Holmes in Washington.
Yes.
I don't mind telling you
I'd give anything to get my hands on that document.
Yes, I know.
Or at least know that it's in safe hands.
Thank you.
Engaged today and married tomorrow.
No thanks.
Have you a match?
- Miss Pattridge?
- Yes?
Lieutenant Merriam asked if you would come to the new apartment.
But he's not supposed to see it yet.
The new apartment?
He must think you're already married.
Yes. I don't dare let that man out of my sight.
- Excuse me will you please?
- Surely.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
May I?
Thank you.
This way please.
Oh, I know the way, thank you.
Peter.
Where are you?
- Well, here we are, Grogan.
- Awe, good connections.
We'd better go into the party.
Well, I think you'd better go in first, Mr. Holmes,
I'm not very good at this sort of thing.
I think you do all right.
It's the only possible explanation.
Mrs. Pattridge, forgive my intruding, but is your niece the kind of girl who would just disappear in this manner of her own free will?
Ordinarily, of course not.
But the girl's in love.
In love.
Well of course, if they're in love that's--
Even so, they'd naturally tell you of their destination.
Really, I've no idea.
Oh, but they'll be back here again tomorrow.
You see, I prepared an apartment for them an entire floor in this house.
By the by Mrs. Pattridge,
I gather the rug you ordered for the apartment was not entirely satisfactory?
Oh, those tiresome workmen.
I told them not to come in here this afternoon but they did.
And walked out with the rug, which they no doubt informed you had been sent by mistake and would be replaced tomorrow.
- Yes, but however did you know that?
- Quick, show me the apartment!
Yes, there were two rugs there.
One for the living room and one for the dining room.
Well you're workman wear rubber sole shoes do they not?
Oh yes, always.
Their company requires them to.
Nevertheless, there have been leather heels on this floor and a woman's heels, very recently I should say.
They're not yours,
Mrs. Pattridge but recently enough so that no dust has had time to settle on the imprints.
Stay over there please.
There seems to have been a struggle over there.
A woman's footprints disappear and a man's leather heels come round, and stop there.
Either she was carried out in the carpet or else--
Where's that door lead to?
Why, it's a dressing room.
Perhaps an ordinary skeleton key.
Try it.
Watson, this is a matter for you I'm afraid.
Excuse me.
- Who is it?
- Is it Merriam?
- Peter!
- Take it easy, Mrs. Partridge.
Let the doctor examine him.
How is he, Watson?
Nasty crack on the head.
Nothing serious, thank heavens.
Is there somewhere where he can lie down?
Of course.
Poor Peter.
Take him to my room.
Here, put your arm around my neck.
That's it, old chap.
- Mr. Holmes you must find Nancy.
- Quite.
Poor Peter.
That girl disappeared right from under our noses.
It's unbelievable.
- I better try to trace that truck.
- That won't lead us anywhere.
Our antagonist is too clever for that but the girl must be found immediately.
You're sure the police chemist found nothing definite in their examination of the trunk?
Not one thing pertinent to the case.
What about Grayson's body and the blanket it was wrapped in?
Nothing.
Every object connected with this case has some kind of story to tell.
Do you think they'd mind if...
- The laboratory is completely at your disposal, Mr. Holmes.
- Thank you.
Doctor Watson and I will go there at once.
The usual findings on the trunk, Mr. Holmes.
Bought in Washington, been banged about a good deal, all labels removed.
- And the body?
- No marks of any kind.
Very well.
If you need me call.
Thank you.
Watson, please.
Just tidying up a bit.
This blanket is beginning to tell me many things.
Oh really, you don't say so.
It only remains to translate them properly.
Yes, just as I thought.
This blanket has had a most varied history.
It's been on a many a sea voyage.
The latest not six months ago.
Since then it has been used to wrap a multiplicity of objects.
Carvings of teak wood, candle snuffers made of pewter and--
- And furniture.
- Furniture?
Yes.
Teak wood leaves an unmistakable stain.
Pewter rubs off easily and there is evidences of wax drippings but what particularly concerns us, Watson is the furniture.
Most likely a chair.
Louis the XV, in yellow and maroon satin.
What do all these things suggest to you, Watson?
Well, I would say an aunt of mine,
Matilda, who lives in Brighton.
Very old fashioned.
- Very aged.
- Exactly.
Antiques.
We've a lot of ground to cover before nightfall.
Ground?
What ground?
If necessary, every antique shop in Washington.
A-A-N-T-I, here we are antiques.
Antiques?
Well what connection is there,
Louis the XV's chair with this Pattridge girl?
This sliver of wood came from a Louis the XV chair that had once been wrapped in that blanket.
From other evidences the blanket supplies
I deduced that it's been used in an antique shop and whoever controls those antiques
- murdered Grayson and kidnapped the girl.
- What?
That's it, Watson.
Come along, before the girl's kidnapper becomes her murderer.
Holmes, I'm fed up with all this shopping for antiques.
We must keep searching, Watson, the girl's in grave danger.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Oh sorry, what is it, Holmes?
This isn't the place it seems to be.
Look, Watson.
Those cabinets, obviously imitation and yet there priced as if they were authentic.
Buyer beware and all that aye, Holmes.
Watson,
I feel certain this is it.
This is my purse.
May I?
Thank you.
What kind of a joke is this?
Oh, don't bother to answer you can tell the police all about it.
And you shall I promise you.
There are no police here haven't you noticed we are quite alone.
I sent for you to ask you a few questions.
You always send a rug for your guests?
That's a very nice rug,
Miss Pattridge.
It's not my idea of a method of transportation.
No, I'm sorry about that but
I'm afraid it was unavoidable.
But why?
You've no right to bring me here like this.
I've always found it wise to take what rights I can get.
Miss Pattridge you have a document, which I must have.
Document?
I have no document.
It won't do you any good to deny it.
But I do deny it. I don't know what you're talking about.
You'll remain a prisoner until you produce it.
How can I produce it when I haven't got it?
But you have.
You'll observe that on the train you had contact with a little
British agent named Grayson.
He gave you something, where is it?
But I hardly even noticed the man.
I wouldn't even had remembered him if I hadn't seen his picture in the paper.
He disappeared or something.
He's dead, Miss Pattridge.
Oh.
Now will you tell me what I want to know?
But I can't.
You won't.
I can't I tell you.
Let me out of here.
He gave me nothing.
That's strange because
I know he spoke to you.
There's something very curious about that door up there.
To open it you'll have to know the combination.
But I tell you, I spoke to no one on that train.
Well didn't that little man try to be attentive to you?
Oh he, he may have offered the usual courtesies. I don't even remember.
I see.
I'm sorry.
Won't you smoke one of these?
Thank you.
And you're quite sure he said nothing at all to you?
Of course I'm sure.
Permit me.
And your certain that nothing passed between you?
I'm certain.
Mr. Howell please.
I must ask you to trust me with your bag a little longer.
I have an eccentric interest in the linings of purses, it's a foible.
Ah, you know
Mr. Howe I believe.
Mr. Howe is a gentleman of unusual accomplishments.
Under his influence I've known people to talk fluently who never talked before.
But I don't know anything
I tell you, nothing!
Nothing, I swear it!
I don't know anything!
You stay out here.
I'll go inside.
I'll assume the character of an eccentric art collector.
As soon as I'm convinced that this is the place were looking for
I'll signal to you and you get Grogan and bring him here on the run but don't take any time, an extra second may cost a life.
No madam,
I don't know who she is but notice the modeling. It has good symmetry, good lines.
Oh, I'll be right with you, sir.
Thank you,
I'll just take a look around.
What an extraordinary cabinet.
Spanish.
Moorish influence.
Imitation of course.
It is not an imitation, it's authentic.
Oh, come now, my dear man.
Ah, may I see some of these ceramics?
Those aren't for sale.
They're Ming vases mostly and they haven't been marked yet.
Well, naturally that's of very little consequence, you see, if they're genuine
I can tell to within a shilling what the international price might be.
If you please, sir.
There are other customers.
Oh yes, yes of course.
Well, I'll just look around.
Ah, what a very interesting collection of pewter.
That will be five hundred dollars.
Now would you just give me the address where you want it sent?
Yes.
Mrs. J. Wellington, Junior,
Duponte Circle.
Good night.
Good night. I'll have it sent out in the morning.
Oh dear, oh dear.
I'm most terribly sorry.
You've broken one of our best pieces, sir.
Ming Dynasty.
Tang dynasty not Ming.
Definitely not Ming.
It is my business to know, sir.
The pottery is Ming and worth twenty-three hundred dollars.
As were closing for the evening I must ask you to settle at once.
Nonsense, my good man.
Tang pottery is worth six hundred dollars at best.
- Just a moment please.
- Yes, of course.
Hello.
What's going on out there?
A customer dropped a valuable piece of pottery.
I'll finish with him immediately.
How could you say that it's Ming?
Twenty-three hundred fiddlesticks.
You ask twenty-three hundred dollars for something that's worth no more than six hundred.
- I demand to see the proprietor.
- Now wait a minute.
There are bureaus for the protection of innocent customers.
Show me to the owner of this establishment or I'll turn the entire affair to my legal representative.
- Ming indeed.
- Just a minute.
What skullduggery.
I mean to put an end to it this very night.
Ming for Tang indeed and I won't be put off.
Call the proprietor immediately!
Very well, just a minute.
Yes?
This man's mad.
An eccentric collector.
I can't get rid of him. Insists on seeing you in person.
All right. Stall him for a half-minute then send him into my office.
I'll get rid of him and quickly.
Now Howe, no screams until the customer's gone.
You get downstairs.
Yes, sir.
I'm most frightfully sorry--
I'm most frightfully sorry about the vase but, but really sir, you're clerk is guilty of attempting the most obvious fraud.
You see he tried to convince me that I'd broken a Ming pottery.
And anyone could see that it belonged to Tang era.
Its value is no more than six hundred dollars.
All right, you pay him the six hundred we'll call the matter settled.
Oh.
Oh, thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
I'll send you my check in the morning.
I...I see you know the London value of these pieces.
It's my business.
Exactly. Yes. Exactly.
You know,
I think you're just the man to help me find some furniture
I'm anxious to get.
I'm most frightfully bored with the usual conglomeration of pieces that we can pick up on the other side.
What do you really want
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?
Herr Heinrich Hinckel or as you now call yourself
Mr. Richard Stanley.
In 1914, secret agent of the German Kaiser.
Since then, head of the most insidious international spy ring that ever existed.
You're wrong.
A case of mistaken identity.
I've been a respected member of this community for a great many years.
I deal in antiques because of their rarity and beauty.
Merely a device to cover up your real business of transporting secret information to the enemies of this country.
Very interesting but just a figment of your imagination.
I am a very busy man,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Where is Nancy Pattridge?
You're not looking for that girl you're looking for a certain document.
Dear me, no.
The document's perfectly safe.
You see the man who has it doesn't know he has it.
That's a very pretty tale but quite untrue.
The only man who had any contact with Grayson on the train was Senator Babcock.
The Senator doesn't have the document we took the trouble to find out.
Permit me.
Thank you.
Perhaps you've been mislead by the common notion regarding the shape and bulk of state papers.
They might easily been reduced to a, to a convenient size you know?
Say, a document no larger than a, than a postage stamp.
A postage stamp, huh?
That's a very interesting theory but not supported by the facts.
And quite beside the point.
Where's the girl?
She's not here of course but you're quite at liberty to look around if you care too.
Thank you.
I shall do so.
Interesting piece.
Spanish isn't it?
Moorish.
Oh, my error.
It's an amazing specimen but I assure you won't find what you're looking for there.
You stimulate my curiosity.
This might be interesting.
The Moors were an incredibly inventive people weren't they?
Yes, it was in shocking condition when I got hold of it but I had it restored.
Very lively now but old fashioned.
If that's the best you can do,
Mr. Stanley,
I think I may safely examine the rest of the room.
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.
Take your hand away from that drawer.
Why Mr. Holmes, you didn't think
I was going to draw a weapon.
I never touch the things.
How odd to find you squeamish.
That connects only with the shop.
You're very quick to say so and yet a short while ago I saw two other men in this room and they didn't go back into the shop so there must be another exit and perhaps another room.
Yes, Mr. Stanley what is it?
Bring Miss Pattridge here at once.
Excellent, Holmes.
I see your voice hasn't lost its flexibility.
And my hand hasn't lost it's cunning either.
When they come here tell them to leave the girl with you and to clear out.
You think I'll do that?
Yes, you will.
You're playing with lives now Stanley.
Not just the girl's but thousands, millions perhaps and we don't intend to let one man have that much power.
Not now, not at any time in the future.
I'd prefer you alive to face the retribution that's coming to you but if I have to do it.
All right, Mr. Holmes,
I suppose we all must meet our match sooner or later.
That's enough boys, take your hands off him.
Well, Mr. Holmes?
Tell the clerk to go home and see that the front door is locked.
Well, Mr. Stanley?
It's the last strike that counts hey, Holmes?
I'll remind you of that later.
Miss Pattridge allow me to present Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the world famous detective.
He's come to rescue you.
I don't believe you.
Oddly enough he's telling you the truth.
My name is Sherlock Holmes and I did come here to help you but I've seemed rather to have missed it.
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you've had a bad time.
Well that doesn't matter its Peter, they say they'll do something to him if I don't tell them.
They say they've got him.
Cheer up, he's quite safe.
A tough customer like Peter isn't disabled very long by a clunk on the head.
He's all right.
All okay, Mr. Stanley.
Look here, Stanley this girl knows nothing.
I promise she won't even identify you.
Well, unfortunately she knows enough to hang us, so do you.
I'm surprised that you're walking into a trap like this but you see the position I'm in and what has to be done.
Cady, Howe.
It will give me great pleasure to attend to
Mr. Holmes personally.
Easter the girl's yours.
It's the police.
Open up, this is the police.
Holmes where are you?
You all right?
Holmes! Holmes!
Where are you?
Darling.
Thank heavens your safe.
Quick, Stanley's escaped.
All right boys bring them along.
Come on, Lieutenant.
Let's go, Doctor.
The Senate office building double quick.
Come in.
I'm glad your safe Senator.
Safe?
No man is safe.
Look at the way my constituents snipe at me.
I don't recall seeing your face before stranger.
I don't think we've met.
- Well, that explains it.
- My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Glad to know you, Holmes.
What's on your mind?
Senator Babcock,
I'm here to inform you of great peril to your life.
Richard Stanley, a dangerous criminal, is now on his way here.
Richard Stanley?
Why he's the most respectable citizen in Washington has been for years.
What could Stanley possibly want from me?
A document and under the stamps of a letter given to you by chap named Grayson.
Grayson?
Grayson?
Used to know a man name...Grayson!
Why that's the fellow that disappeared.
Say, I got that envelope right here in my wallet.
Now what does Stanley think could be under these stamps?
A secret document of grave importance.
Reduced to microfilm and concealed under these very stamps.
Thank you very much,
Mr. Holmes.
That's just what
I wanted to know.
I might have missed this microfilm if you hadn't lead me to it.
I've seemed to have underestimated your capabilities, Mr. Stanley.
Yes, Mr. Holmes, you're famous powers of deduction and observation made of very well in Limehouse or Soho but here in America I believe you're out of your depth.
If so, the verdict of history will be severe indeed.
You nervous, Sherlock Holmes?
I must confess to a mark irritation.
Do you mind if I smoke?
Thank you.
The whole course of the world might be changed by your acquisition of the microfilm.
It will be and for the better.
Have you a match?
You can keep those.
Thank you.
And now if you'll pardon me,
Mr. Holmes.
Why don't you do something,
Holmes if that thing so all fired important?
The English senator.
Cricket old boy, always cool in the crisis.
The last trick, hey Holmes?
Yes, the last trick.
Say, you're a smart fellow,
Holmes.
- Here's the microfilm, Holmes.
- Thank you, Senator.
I say, Holmes.
This is the microfilm with the document on it.
It'll be in the proper hands within the hour.
As I told you Mr. Stanley, the man who had it didn't know he had it.
Well, come on let's go.
Well, it'll be nice to get home to Baker Street, hey Holmes?
Yes, but this is a great country, Watson.
It certainly is, my dear fellow.
Look, up there ahead, the Capitol, the very heart of this democracy.
Democracy, the only hope for the future, hey Holmes?
"It's not given to us to peer into the mysteries of the future but in the days to come the British and American people will, for their own safety and for the good of all, walk together in majesty, and justice, and in peace."
That's magnificent.
I quite agree with you.
Not with me, with Mr. Winston Churchill.
I was quoting from the speech he made not so long ago in that very building.
Whoa, Dan!
- Pinky!
- Yes, sir.
- Come over here.
- Yes, sir.
Take him back to the barn.
I'm going up to the house.
- Clem oughta be getting in from town.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Frank.
- Pinky.
- Yes, sir?
Ain't you never gonna learn?
What's my name?
Why, uh, Woodson.
Mr. Ben Woodson, sir.
Why do you call me Mr. Frank?
Ain't it just as easy to say Mr. Ben?
Well, seein' as I been calling you Mr. Frank ever since you were knee-high to nothin'... ain't no harm in callin' you Mr. Frank when ain't nobody around here, is there?
Except that one day you're gonna forget and bawl out Mr. Frank when folks is around.
Pinky, Frank James isn't hiding in these hills. He's dead.
Dead?
W- Well, you ain't dead.
- You callin' me a liar?
- Oh, no, sir. No, sirree, but—
Ain't no buts about it, Pinky. Frank James is dead and buried and underground.
Yes, sure. Sure he's dead and buried and under the ground and rotted.
- Now remember.
- Yes, I'll remember, Mr. Frank.
Jesse—
They killed him!
- Jesse dead?
- Yeah. Shot through the back when he weren't lookin'.
Ain't no other way they could have got Jesse. They know who done it?
Sure they know. It was them sneakin' cowards, Bob and Charlie Ford.
Bob and Charlie, huh?
Poor Zee and the baby.
Frank, can I go with you?
Go with me?
Well, I know you don't need any help, but—
I reckon I don't, seein' as I ain't aimin' to do anything.
What?
Ain't no more to be said now.
Tell Pinky to rustle up some supper.
Gosh, I was so sure you'd wanna light out after them Fords...
I bought me a gun.
Hand it over.
I used my own money.
Hand it over.
You're getting too big for your britches, son.
You got no call to be totin' a gun.
Well, I figured if there was any trouble—
There ain't gonna be no trouble.
Listen, son.
When your father was killed up at Northfield...
I brought you down here hopin' you'd grow up to be a regular hardworkin' man.
So far I got no complaints.
We've been gettin' along fine, you and me... workin', mindin' our own business.
We bothered nobody.
Nobody's bothered us.
Ain't what them Fords done bothered you none?
The courts will take care of the Fords.
- Supposin' they don't?
- I'm supposin' they will.
Whatever Jesse done, he was murdered, and the law don't hold with murder.
Frank, if nothin' gonna happen to them Fords... ain't some folks gonna think that...
- well, maybe you're—
- Scared?
- Well?
- What do you think?
Oh, I know you ain't scared.
You ain't scared of anything.
But, gosh, I wish you and me, we could—
Vittles is ready.
Sit down, Mr. Frank.
I mean, Mr. Ben.
I mean, Mr. Ben.
Mr. Frank is dead.
I mean, Mr. Ben, Mr. Frank is dead.
So I mean, Mr. Ben, mmm, Mr. Ben,
I mean, Mr. Ben, Mr. Frank is dead.
So, I mean, Mr. Ben. I mean, Mr. Ben.
I mean, Mr. Ben, Mr. Frank is dead.
Sinners, sons of Belial... prepare for the vengeance of the Lord.
The day of reckoning is mighty close.
You'll catch it hip and thigh if you don't get to repentin'. And get to it quick.
Hellfire's awaitin' you.
Are you ready to meet your Maker?
I reckon so.
You willing to stand before the judgment seat with a chaw of tobacco in your mouth?
Lost souls,
that's what you all are.
Black with sin.
Black with iniquity.
The light of the Lord ain't in any of you.
Do you ever think of salvation?
Do you ever think of the Kingdom?
No. All you ever think of is your bellies and your cornpone...
and your chitlins
and your corn liquor.
Brother, how about a swig of that jug?
- Ain't hard liquor, is it?
- No, plain spring water.
Oh.
- Crop all in?
- Yeah.
- You from town?
- Uh-huh.
- Any news?
- Hogs is up two cents.
- Good.
- You remember about them Ford boys?
- The fellas that killed Jesse James?
- Yeah.
- I "heared" at the telegraph office they're gonna be hanged.
- You don't tell me.
Uh-huh. Jury found them guilty of murderin' Jesse.
Don't know why though, bein' as there's a reward out for his killin'.
Revival meetin' at Clinton tomorrow night.
Be there, brother. It's me and the devil and no holds barred.
Giddap!
Law's all right, huh?
"Beatenest" thing I ever did see.
It's like I figured, ain't a jury in western Missouri... would stand for shooting a friend when he ain't lookin', no matter what he done.
That'll be a lesson to you, son.
What about us going over to that revival meeting tomorrow night?
I think it's safe enough
if I sort of stay in the shadows.
I reckon you'd like to see some other folks once in a while.
Oh, I ain't hankerin' to see no other folks.
But let's go fishin' tomorrow, you and me, huh?
Sure, son, sure.
Here it is, Mr. Frank.
Ain't they hangin' 'em?
No, they let them off and give them the reward money.
I knowed that preacher man heared wrong.
It's just like my pappy always said...
"There ain't no law for the poor folks except the end of a gun."
Hush up.
I was certain sure they wasn't gonna do nothin'.
Did they ever do anything for our kind of folks? No.
McCoy and his railroad stole your farm and killed your mother. What happened? Nothin'.
And that time Jesse give hisself up.
Did the law treat him right?
Uh—
Pinky, saddle the horses.
- Yes, sir!
- Just my horse.
- Yes, sir.
- You ain't goin' nowheres.
Oh, please, Frank.
I won't get in the way.
You and Pinky gotta stay here and look after the farm. I won't be gone long.
Oh, Pinky can take care of things.
There ain't much to do right now.
The fence has gotta be finished.
The stock's gotta be taken care of.
- Anyways, you're too young.
- I'm no baby. I'm grown up.
Ain't no use arguin', Clem.
The Fords is my affair personal... and you ain't goin' with me.
Pinky, I'm leavin' Clem in your charge.
- Don't let him get out of your sight.
- No, sir.
- See he studies his figurin' and his readin'.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Frank.
If you want me for anything important,
Major Cobb will know where I am.
- Good-bye, Pinky. Good-bye, son.
- Good-bye, sir.
Look after things while I'm gone too.
- Hello, Joe. Hello, Fred.
- Hello.
Didn't know you boys could read.
Hello, Connie.
How's your pa?
Whiskey. What'll it be, boys?
Bob Ford's buyin'.
- Have a drink, Major.
- I don't drink with rats.
- Watch out, Major.
- No danger. The Fords only shoot at backs.
- You tryin' to make trouble?
- No, but if I had my way—
You had your way.
You and your stinkin' paper... did everything you could to hang us, didn't ya?
Well, we're free now, and we got the reward money.
- There isn't a thing you can do about it.
- Come, come, gentlemen.
Let bygones be bygones.
The James case is a closed issue.
Not by a gosh-dang sight it ain't.
And it won't be closed till Jesse's brother's paid for every dad-blasted drop of it.
Your hands ain't any too clean either, Runyan.
Mine?
What have I done?
As an officer employed by the railroad, naturally l—
Oh, don't pay any attention to the old buzzard. Talk, talk, that's all he can do.
Yeah, that's about all I can do.
But those James boys are mighty peculiar. Mighty peculiar.
Jesse's gone, that's true.
Maybe Frank's gone too.
And then again, maybe he ain't.
The boys always had a mighty peculiar
way of turning up...
just when you least expected them.
Mighty peculiar.
What are your plans?
I'm going out West to see a friend of mine.
When?
Now.
Now read it back to me, Roy.
"If we're ever gonna have law and order in this part of the country...
"we gotta take vipers like those Fords...
"and that slimy railroad detective Runyan... and shoot 'em down like dogs."
Right. Now, paragraph.
"Furthermore, we've got to abolish the pardoning power"—
Better go back and get your supper, Roy.
Yes, sir.
Come in, Frank, come in. Come in!
I knew you'd be along this way soon, but you're a wee bit late.
- Late? Ain't they here?
- No. They's gone out of town a few hours ago.
Yeah, yeah, get away from this window.
Now, now, come on. Sit down and tell me all about yourself and your folks.
Here. Here. Have a drink.
- Well, family's all right. They're in Kansas City.
- Yeah?
About me?
There ain't nothin' to tell.
I've been hiding out down in the Ozarks, farmin'. Heard about Jesse.
Frank, it was the dirtiest, rottenest, sneakiest that ever was.
Oh, Jesse may have had killin' comin' to him. I ain't denyin' that.
But to be shot in the back by a couple of fellas that was like brothers to you... with a weapon you give them yourself.
- I know, but about this pardon—
- All part of the same piece.
McCoy put the Fords up to the killin', then got 'em the pardon and the reward.
- McCoy, huh?
- Yeah.
Got no idea at all where the Fords went to?
None whatever, exceptin' they took the cars west.
What you aimin'to do?
Sure like to meet up with Bob and Charlie.
Old friends of mine, you know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know. I know.
Well, I'll be movin' along.
Well, good huntin', Frank.
- I'll let you know where I am.
- All right.
- Good night, Major.
- Hold on. Hold on, son, hold on.
Wait.
Come on. Come on.
Bye, son.
Roy!
- Yes, sir.
- Get out them obituaries of the Fords...
- and set 'em up in type.
- Yes, sir.
Giddap! Giddap!
Pinky.
What are you doing here?
- That boy Clem done run away.
- Run away? When?
Just after you left.
He hopped on his horse and scat.
I tried to stop him, but he nearly knocked me over.
That boy's harder to hold than a handful of bumblebees.
Y'all find what you're looking for, sir?
No, Pinky, they ain't here. They lit out for the West somewheres.
Mm, must have got a feeling.
You goin' out after them, sir?
Yeah, but not for a while maybe.
I gotta get me some money.
You ain't figurin' on no robbin', is ya?
No, Pinky, them days is far behind me.
Praise the Lord, Mr. Frank.
Praise the Lord.
- Pinky, I'm a-thinkin'.
- About what, Mr. Frank?
It was McCoy money that put Jesse in his grave back there, wasn't it?
Then ain't it fittin' I use
McCoy money to get the Fords?
What'd you say, Mr. Frank?
Yeah, that's right.
- Tomorrow's the 15th, ain't it?
- Yes, sir, it's the 15th.
St. Louis Midland pays off the first and the 15th.
- Money oughta be in the express office tonight.
- Oh, Mr. Frank.
- Pinky, go back to the farm right away and stay there.
- Yes, sir, sir.
If Clem shows up, tell him I'm gonna brush the britches right off of him.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Frank.
- Good-bye, Pinky.
Good-bye, Mr. Frank.
And God bless you, sir.
Good evenin'.
Kinda chilly for spring, ain't it?
Yeah, a nip in the air.
What's on your mind, friend?
Well, I got this to send out.
- Can't you send it in the mornin', can't ya?
- No. Wanna get it on the 4:15.
Oh, all right.
Can you write?
Yes, sir, after a fashion.
All right.
Then fill out this blank.
- Reach, brother.
- I-I'm a-reachin'.
I got a notion when I come in you was kind of sleepy.
- Suppose you lay down and rest a while.
- Huh?
Down!
Flat on your face.
Now lay there still and don't let me hear a peep out of you.
You'll hear nothin' from me, brother.
I wanna be around for breakfast.
Go to sleep.
I'll wake you up before I go.
- Get down.
- Yes, sir.
Clem!
- What are you doin' here?
- I've been followin' ya. I was watchin' outside.
- And when you didn't come out—
- You fool, I almost shot you.
Now get outta here and back to the farm before I skin you alive. Git!
Bolt the door.
Keep your eye on the watchman.
Where'd that shot come from?
Down here, Sid. Come on!
- What's up?
- There's a shot!
- Seemed to come from in there.
- You and you, get a ram, break that door down.
A couple of you men get around to the rear.
Come on, the back way.
Come on, boys, break 'er down!
Get in there!
Come on.
Shh.
- You afraid?
- No.
Come on.
Hyah! Giddap! Hyah!
I'm sorry about what I done, Frank.
You might have been killed.
Well, I guess there ain't nothin' to be done about it now.
They'll be wanting me too.
I tell you, there isn't the slightest doubt about it.
I know a James boy job when I see one.
I ought to,
I've seen enough of them.
It was Frank James... and I'm offering another reward of $10,000.
I'll wipe him out, just like I did his brother.
Mr. McCoy, with your permission...
I should like to leave at once for the West.
- What for?
- To see if I can locate Charles and Bob Ford.
What have they got to do with it?
If I can find the Ford boys...
I've got a very good idea that
Frank James will not be far behind.
- Then go on, by all means.
- Thank you.
- There were two of them, weren't there?
- Yes, Mr. McCoy.
Yes. One of them was Frank, but who was the other?
Frank's got a lot of friends.
- Where's Jesse buried?
- Just outside of town.
You can laugh if you want to, but I'm going out and have a look at that grave.
I don't trust anything about those James boys.
Well, if it ain't Mr. Woodson.
- How are ya?
- Fine, sonny.
Where are you and your father been keeping yourselves?
Well, Pa got him a ranch down in old Mexico, just below the border.
- Like it down there?
- Oh, fine cattle country.
But you sure gotta be handy with a gun.
Shootin' scrapes all the time.
Guess who I seen killed in a fight just before I left.
- Who?
- Frank James.
Has he been down there?
 Yes, sir, and he's gonna stay
down there, six feet under the ground.
They must have pumped
15 slugs into him.
Well, he had it comin' to him, I reckon.
Let's go and have a drink.
I need one. I'm spittin' sand hills.
Wait till I get my saddlebags.
So, they finally got Frank.
Appears that way.
I done all right, huh?
Fine. I once seen Booth, and he couldn't acted it better.
Thanks. You think the news will get around?
Hope so. Once the Fords find out I'm dead... maybe they'll come out of their hole, wherever they are.
- Well, the Fords aren't the only ones—
- Shh.
The Fords aren't the only ones you gotta play dead for.
- McCoy's got a reward out.
- I know. I got a letter from the major.
McCoy's got an idea I had something to do with that express job.
Suspicious cuss, ain't he?
- Major write you they found out about the farm?
- No.
Well, they have.
McCoy's got a flock of men... watching every road and cow path around there.
I think it's all right though.
Pinky won't talk.
No, Pinky won't talk, but it's just as well I'm dead.
- What'll it be?
- Beer.
- And what for you?
- Make his sarsaparilla.
Right.
Now what'd you do that for?
I've tasted beer.
Mr. Woodson, sir.
Lady wants to see you.
- A lady?
- Yes, sir. She's waiting in the parlor.
Give me half a dollar to fetch ya.
- All right.
- This way, sir.
- Mr. Woodson?
- Yes, ma'am?
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for the man... who saw Frank James killed in Mexico.
And they told me he was talking to you on the porch.
It was me that seen the killing, ma'am.
- Oh, then it's you I wanna talk to.
- Just a minute, miss.
Who are you, if you don't mind?
My name's Eleanor Stone.
I'm a newspaper writer.
I was passing the hotel, and somebody told me that—
A writer? You mean you write pieces for the paper?
Yes, a reporter for the Denver Star.
A lady reporter?
Mind if I sit down?
It'll be easier for me to take notes.
Sure do beat all, a lady newspaperman.
Well, I'm not really and truly a reporter, not yet.
But I'm going to be.
My father's the owner of the Star.
Maybe you've heard of him—
Randolph Stone.
Well, can't say I have.
But if he owns the paper, I should think he'd be doing well enough... so his daughter don't have to work.
Oh, I don't have to work.
And, if you must know... my father's very much opposed to it.
He thinks I should finish college... and then sit around with my hands folded... waiting for someone to get around to marrying me.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
Women are awakening.
- They wanna do things. They—
- Not where I come from.
Women figure they're doing plenty feeding a dozen farmhands and raisin' kids.
We can't all feed farmhands and have babies.
Everybody to their taste.
I wanna be a newspaperwoman.
Now tell me about Frank James.
If I can get a good story, maybe my father will be convinced I can be a reporter.
Won't you help me?
Sure, we'll help.
Go ahead.
Tell her everything, son.
Well, it all happened about six weeks ago.
We'd been down in Hernandez herdin' longhorns.
And that night we went into town to do a little drinkin'.
- A boy like you?
- Ma'am, I ain't no boy.
Down in Mexico, I do a man's work
and a man's drinkin'!
When we got to Whiskey Joe's, there was a drunken crowd there from another ranch... a- roughin' things up.
Frank James— Oh, I've seen him a couple times before— he was up at the bar, drinkin' quiet and mindin' his own business.
You taking this down in that newfangled shorthand?
Oh, no, just making notes as I would in classes. Go ahead.
So, this crowd from the other ranch was a-whoopin' it up... especially the foreman, a fella they call Red—
Oh, like this— when a girl comes in the place.
Oh, a little girl, maybe 10 or 12, lookin' for her pa.
Red makes a grab for her, and she starts cryin' and a-screamin'.
And that plumb annoys Frank.
He comes over from the bar... and he pulls the girl away from Red and knocks him a-kickin'.
Right away I knows there's
gonna be trouble in bushel lots.
Everybody exceptin'Red's gang
runs out of the place.
It bein' none of my ruckus,
I ducks behind the bar.
But Frank don't scare any.
He pulls his gun and stands with his back up against the bar.
It's one against 12 or 15.
Red and his crew start blazin' away.
And Frank's blazin' right back.
He knocks off two guys... and then gets hit himself in the left arm.
Well, to make it short,
he finishes off Red.
Good. Good!
Better be takin' all this down, miss.
- It's all right. I'll remember.
- Uh, where was I?
Oh, yeah. He finishes off Red and five or six of his gang.
By this time, Frank himself is leakin' like a sieve.
He's down on the ground, dyin', but still fightin'... when a slug gets him in the heart.
Then the fellas that are left empty their guns into him.
- Oh, the cowards!
- This belonged to Frank.
See, it's marked F.J.
I picked it up figuring I could give it to his kinfolks if I ever run into them.
Oh, what a wonderful story for the paper.
Oh, yes, wonderful story.
Thank you. Thank you ever so much.
Oh, I must have your name.
Uh, Grayson. Tom Grayson.
Did you say this happened six weeks ago?
Then he couldn't have been mixed up in that Missouri express robbery... that I've been reading about, where a man was killed.
Oh, no, Frank had been in Mexico over a year.
Frank James never killed nobody.
Of course, I ain't countin' that Mexico business.
He and his brother must have been wonderfully colorful characters.
I wish I could have known him.
Well, I must hurry along to the paper.
Good-bye, and thank you so much.
I, uh— Sometimes I... might have news.
- Could I see you?
- I'd be glad to see you anytime.
You'll always be able to reach me at the Star... now.
Well, it's very good. But I still think a newspaper is no place for a woman.
- Now, now, dear, please don't be so severe.
- Edna, don't interfere.
But, Papa, you've got to admit... this is the biggest scoop you've had in six months.
Been telegraphed all over the country, and I got it for you.
No, my dear, you just stumbled on it.
That can happen to anybody.
- But I do go on the payroll, don't I?
- Thank you.
I don't know. I don't know.
I've got to think that over.
No, thank you.
Take the horses out by the side entrance and don't leave 'em.
- We may need them in a hurry.
- You goin' in?
Looks like a show I oughta see.
You gonna shoot 'em right on the stage?
No. First I'm just gonna scare 'em to death.
Well, it's time I was a-leavin'.
Where is that dratted valise of mine?
Here it is, Father.
All packed.
And I didn't forget your rheumatism medicine neither.
I hate to go leaving you alone,
Nellie, but I got to.
Uncle Joe's a-dyin'.
Don't worry, Pappy.
I'll be safe.
Nobody suspects the farm money's in this box.
And anyhow,
I know how to use this.
May God keep you safe, my daughter.
Go away.
There's nobody home.
 Open the door,
or we'll break it down.
Go away.
- We want the farm money.
- Take another step and I'll shoot.
- Oh, no, you won't. You know who we are?
- No, and I don't care.
I'm Jesse James.
This is my brother, Frank.
- Now, do we get the money?
- Over my dead body.
If that's the way you want it.
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Why didn't you do what I told you to?
- I wanted to see you give it to 'em.
- Where'd you put the horses?
Over there on the corner.
The theater's on fire!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Giddap! Giddap there!
Come on!
Giddap!
Come on!
That's one of'em, Jesse.
- I beg your pardon, but you're Miss Stone?
- Yes.
My name is Runyan.
I'm from the St. Louis Midland.
Oh, railroad police.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
I'm, uh, sorry to disturb you... but, uh, it's just a formality.
Uh, I'm checking up on the death of Frank James.
Uh, you wrote the story about it, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Now I'm writing a story of his life.
Oh? Should be very interesting.
Very.
Um, that youngster who gave you the account of the killing... tell me about him.
- What did he look like?
- Look like?
Well, he was a boy not more than 16 or so.
Light, curly hair.
Turned-up nose.
That's about all I can tell you.
Ah, I see.
Um, in your story, there was something about a friend who was with the boy.
What did he look like?
Hmm, he was a man about 29 to 30... six feet tall, maybe more.
Hard to tell.
Walks with a sort of stoop.
Has blue eyes and rather high cheekbones.
Speaks with a slow drawl, but doesn't say much.
Yes. What did you say his name was?
Woodson. Ben Woodson.
Woodson. He here now?
No. They told me over at the hotel that he'd suddenly been called away on business.
But I'm sure he'll be back soon.
At any rate, you hope so.
Yes, I do.
He's most likable.
Yes.
I guess women could find a certain something about Frank.
- Frank?
- Your friend Woodson...
- is Frank James.
- What did you say?
I said your likable friend is Frank James, outlaw and murderer.
You—You can't mean it.
Isn't this your friend Woodson?
But I don't understand.
Why should—
It's all very simple, my dear.
You see, Frank had two very good reasons for wanting to be dead:
The express robbery in Missouri and his friends, the Fords.
I don't believe it.
He wouldn't do that.
He was so nice and helpful.
- You sure there's no mistake?
- Oh, quite.
You see, right after reading your story,
I went down to the border.
 Nobody there had ever heard
of the gunfight that boy told you about.
I'm sorry, my dear.
You were the victim of a very cruel hoax.
You and your paper.
However, all hardened criminals are cruel and vicious.
Uh, you said he was coming back?
That's what they told me at the hotel...
- but now that the news is out—
- But the news isn't out.
Only the two of us
know about Woodson.
Well, uh, I'll be leaving you now.
But you'll hear from me very soon.
And don't worry, my dear, you will have the last laugh.
- Mose?
- Yes, miss?
- There's something I want you to do for me.
- Yes'm.
- You remember that man you took the message to last week?
- You mean Mr. Woodson?
Yes. Now here's what I want you to do.
He's away now, but when he comes back to the hotel... tell him not to go inside, not to talk to anybody... or to see anybody until he gets in touch with me.
- Understand?
- Yes'm.
This Mr. Woodson ain't on no account to do nothing until he done seen you.
All right, Mose, but remember, it's important—very, very important—
and be sure—
Look! Look at it, Frank.
A hair. A real hair.
See it?
Yeah, feel it. Feel it.
Couple more like that, and you'll need a mustache cup, son.
Hands up, gentlemen.
Well, this is a real pleasure, Frank.
I haven't seen you since that little affair at Northfield.
Oh, come now.
Don't act that way. Be sociable.
How about a little of that charm you loosed on that lady reporter, huh?
Oh, you're quite a storyteller,
aren't you, bub?
Yeah. All right, put on your boots and your coats... and we'll make a little call on the marshal.
Come on.
Guess you're wondering
how I caught up with you, huh?
Very, very simple.
I knew that Mexican story was a fake the minute I read it.
Showed a picture of you
to Miss Stone, and there you are.
Yes, you lawbreakers are all just about the same.
Oh, some of you are smarter
than others, but sooner or later...
you'll all trip yourselves up!
I did good, didn't I?
Yes, son, this time you sure did.
Take a deep breath, missy.
Boyjust left this for you.
Tell my mother
I may be late for dinner.
A friend of mine's ill.
Going over to see her.
Yes'm.
Come in.
Come in!
Help! Police! Help! Help!
Come out or I'll shoot!
Try to commit suicide, huh?
Huh?
Yeah, that's how it was. Didn't mean to lie, but there was nothing else I could do.
- I'm awfully sorry l—
- And you should be.
Taking advantage of a young girl... and hanging up people in closets like raincoats.
But you can't stay here.
You've got to get away.
If you don't, they'll be hanging you like they're hanging your friend.
- Friend? What friend?
- Didn't you read about it?
The paper gives his name as Pinky.
- Pinky something or other.
- What?
Here, I cut it out.
Why, they're plumb loco.
Pinky wasn't even in town when it happened.
I sent him back to the farm.
They can't hang him.
He's already been found guilty...
- and sentenced.
- But he's innocent.
He's as innocent as you are.
Some of McCoy's work.
His way of getting back at me.
Pinky never so much as even stole a chicken in his whole life.
- What are you going to do?
- I gotta do something.
I- I wanna talk to you.
Go ahead.
You can talk in front of her.
- Well, it's about Bob Ford.
I found out where he is.
- Yeah?
Mining camp called Creede.
About four or five days' ride from here.
Some fellas at the livery stable were talking about him.
- Get out the horses. I'll be right with you.
- All right.
So, you're going to let your friend hang after all.
What? Well, there's nothin'
I can do about it now.
- Once I get Bob Ford out—
- But you'll be too late.
If you'll look at the clipping, you'll see the hanging's set for next week.
I know, but what can I do?
Tell me, is it more important for you to kill a man... than to save the life of an innocent one?
Nothing's more important to me than gettin' Bob Ford.
I'll send a telegram to the governor.
I'll tell him Pinky's innocent.
Promise to give myself up the minute I've taken care of Ford.
But anyone could send a telegram and sign your name.
You've got to go yourself... now.
Frank, you can't do anything else.
Killing is one thing, but letting an innocent man die—
I know, and I agree with you, but it may be my only chance.
I promise you once I get Bob Ford,
I'll give myself up.
Good-bye, Eleanor.
Come in.
Oh, so it's you.
Close that door and sit down. I've got
a few things to say to you, young lady.
All right, Papa.
Get it over with.
Uh-huh. I suppose you realize you've made me and the Star...
- the laughingstock of the country.
- I'm sorry.
Oh, I suppose you think that takes care of everything.
- Other papers have made mistakes.
- Yes, but none of them... have made the mistake of having a gullible female on their staff and trusting her.
None of them have—
You saw that interview with Runyan in the Globe this morning, didn't you?
- Yes, I saw it.
- Uh-huh. It's all true, isn't it?
- Not altogether.
- Oh, no?
Didn't Runyan come to see you?
Didn't Frank James hang him up in the closet?
Ha. I suppose you'll be telling me next
that Frank James is really dead.
I could hardly tell you that.
I talked to him last night.
You saw him?
That murderer, and you didn't turn him in?
Young lady, you're going back to college tomorrow.
I've had enough of your nonsense.
My daughter mixed up with murderers.
Papa, I've got to go to Liberty, Missouri.
You bet you do.
What? What's that?
Did you read a story in your paper about a Negro named Pinky... who's going to be hanged in a few days as an accomplice in the express robbery?
- Yes, yes. What about it?
- Well, he's innocent, and—
What's that got to do with you?
Have you gone out of your mind?
How do you know he's innocent?
If you'll stop standing on your head and sit down...
I'll tell you how I know and why I've got to go to Liberty.
- Makes good eatin'—wild hen. Don't it?
- Mm-hmm.
'Course... it didn't get the fine cookin'
Pinky had've given—
- I can't do it, Clem.
- Can't do what?
- Can't go on.
- What's the matter? You sick?
Yeah, sick inside.
In a few days they'll be hangin' Pinky.
Hangin' him for something he didn't do.
Must have been crazy.
I'm goin' back, Clem.
- And let Bob Ford get away?
- Let Bob Ford get away.
Well, you can't do it, Frank.
You can't.
After all our work, are we gonna give up on account of a darky?
We're goin', Clem.
It ain't Pinky makin' you do this.
It's that girl in Denver.
You got her on your mind more than you have Bob Ford.
In a few seconds, you're gonna have an awful sore seat, son.
Maybe I am, but what would Jesse think if he knew you were walkin' out on him?
That's enough, Clem.
I guess she's afraid you're gonna get hurt.
"Oh, don't go, Frank.
That poor Ford boy"—
I'm goin', Clem, and I'm goin' alone.
Frank! Frank!
Frank!
- Can I go with you?
- Suit yourself.
- What you doin'that for?
- We're honest men, Clem.
Yeah, but tain't a fair swap.
Why, I could get—
Maybe you could, son. Maybe you could, but we got no time for tradin' talk.
Pick out a couple of good head.
Hey, stranger. How much you figure an outfit like this is worth?
Oh, about $500 or $600.
Here's $600.
I'll throw in the horses.
Come on, Clem.
- Anything wrong?
- No, exceptin' that outfit don't belong to me.
When's the next through train east?
Just missed it.
Won't be another till tomorrow.
It's no good. We gotta be in Kansas City tomorrow.
You can make up your mind you ain't gonna be.
Those trains there—
Them's freights, all except number eight. That's fast mail.
- Due in a few minutes, ain't it?
- Yeah.
But it don't even—
Whistle goin' through here.
- You can flag it, can't you?
- What, flag number eight?
What for?
It don't carry passengers.
Only mail and fast express.
You're gonna flag it tonight, partner.
Come on. Get your lantern.
- Come on. Get goin'. Get goin'.
- Y-Yes, sir.
I guess you know you can be arrested for this.
- Federal offense, stoppin' a mail train.
- Yeah, we know. Go on. Go on.
I'm goin'. I'm goin'.
Take it easy.
Engineer's gonna be mighty surprised.
Mail ain't stopped here in the 10 years it's been runnin'.
Keep swingin', brother.
Keep swingin'.
Y- Yes, sir.
- Hey, what's the trouble?
- What's the mat— Holy smoke. It's a holdup.
It ain't a holdup.
We just wanna ride with you.
Get goin'. Don't stop till you get to Kansas City, no matter what.
Get in the cab with him, Clem.
Hold her open, brother.
I'm comin' in with you.
Sorry, miss, but there ain't no reason.
But there is a reason, a good reason.
Frank James is liable to come in any day now... and when he does, you'll hear the truth from his own lips.
I see. So you want us to hold up the hanging while Frank is out murdering another man.
No. I want you to wait, to keep from murdering a man.
Pinky's not guilty. I know it, and I think you know it too.
What harm would there be in postponing?
What for? To give Frank James a chance to raise a gang... and raid the jail like he did once before?
That's it! That's what the scheme is, and you're part of it!
- You're a fool, McCoy, and a dad-blasted liar!
- Now, now, Major.
A liar and a sneaky little coward to boot.
You couldn't get at Frank... so you're striking at him through his poor helpless Negro boy.
- You and your perjured witnesses and this weak-kneed—
- There's nothing to be done here.
Why, for two cents I'd take you out and shoot you down like a dog...
you dad-blasted Yankee scum!
I couldn't stay.
In an hour it'll all be over... and I want to be as far away as I can.
- I understand, my dear, and I'm sorry.
- It's all right, Major.
You've been very kind, but I'll never understand your people.
No, you'd have to live among us a long time to do that.
Now don't think too badly of Frank, because he—
He and I and all of us around here—
Well, we've been brought up to right our own wrongs, regardless of everything.
And what about the wrong being done Pinky?
If you ever see Frank James again,
tell him I think he's low and contemptible.
Only a selfish brute
would let an innocent man die.
Well, good-bye, Major, and—
- Good-bye, my dear.
- Thank you again.
Frank! Did you get him?
- No.
- Oh, the dirty rotten coward!
- I knew you'd come.
- Did you?
Yes. Behind all my doubts, there was always a feeling that—
Put 'em up, Frank...
and keep 'em up.
I see you finally got out of that closet all right.
Oh, yes. And now let's see you get out of a rope around your neck. Put 'em on.
Goin' to an awful lot of bother, ain't you?
Oh, no bother. It's a pleasure—
A real pleasure.
Uh, where's that young friend of yours?
Hidin' out, but I just can't remember where.
I see. All right, get along.
Frank?
Good morning, Miss Stone.
L—
Oh, I'm sorry, miss, but this table is reserved for reporters.
- But I am a reporter.
I represent the Denver Star.
- Denver Star?
- Mr. Runyan.
- Thank you, sir. Ah, good luck.
This case?
Tain't too late, Frank, if you want to get another lawyer.
I haven't practiced in nigh unto 20 years... not since I took over the Gazette, and I may be a mite rusty.
Ah, rusty or not, you can do as much for me as any other lawyer... and I reckon that ain't hardly anything at all.
Maybe so, maybe so.
But we ain't quittin'.
McCoy and that gosh-dinged
Yankee prosecutor of his... will be breathin' mighty heavy before I'm through with them.
Order in the court!
Order in the court!
Everybody stand.
Court is now in session.
Hear ye—
That ain't the regular judge, is it?
No, that's Ferris. They brought him on from St. Louis.
- Just to make sure, eh?
- Uh-huh.
...is now in session. Be seated.
Your Honor, the case
on the docket is number 4358.
State of Missouri v. Frank James.
You may proceed.
Not only did he rob the express office... but we will prove beyond the slightest peradventure of a doubt... that the defendant, Frank James... in keeping with his long, murderous career—
I object! The defendant's not on trial in this court for a long, murderous career... any more than the prosecuting attorney is charged... with being in the pay of the St. Louis Midland Railway.
- I resent the innuendo!
- Then stick to the charges in the indictment!
- I'm not asking you, sir, what—
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!
Now, gentlemen, I propose to have this trial conducted in a quiet and orderly manner.
The prosecutor will confine himself to the matter contained in the true bill.
And you, sir, will refrain from personalities.
Thejury will ignore
the exchange between counsel.
We are not concerned with crimes other
than those mentioned in the indictment.
And we certainly are not concerned...
with the railroad associations
of the prosecuting attorney.
I object, Your Honor.
There have been no associations.
I am not aware that I have said there were. You may proceed.
The State will prove... not only did the defendant rob the express office... but also that he shot down the watchman, Wilson, in cold blood.
The State calls its first
witness, Sheriff Daniels.
Sheriff Daniels.
You say Frank James admitted robbing the express office.
Yes, he did, and before witnesses.
I didn't ask you before whom.
You just answer my questions.
That'll be enough of a strain on that giant intellect of yours.
- Did Frank James also admit killing the watchman?
- No.
- He denied it.
- Yes.
He said Dan was killed by a shot from the outside.
- How long you been sheriff?
- Two years.
Before that, what'd you do?
I object, Your Honor!
What possible bearing... can the former occupation of the witness have on this trial?
I see no objection to the question.
You may answer it.
- I was in charge of... special police.
- Who for?
- St. Louis Midland Railway.
- Louder! And speak to the jury.
- St. Louis Midland Railway.
- That's all.
Your Honor, I must take exception to this line of questioning.
My learned opponent, in his desperation... is trying to make it appear that the railroad company... and not the state of Missouri is prosecuting this defendant.
- The court is under no deception.
- Oh, of that I'm quite certain.
But that there be no doubt in the minds of the jury...
I am about to produce five witnesses— none of whom is connected even remotely with the Midland— who were present when Frank James confessed.
Tain't necessary. We admit Frank James robbed the express office.
- That's the case.
- Yep. Thought the major would talk about duress or something.
- Or at least make the State prove it.
- Why, certainly.
- What are you doing here?
- I had to come.
Anyhow, there ain't no sense in me hidin' out. Nobody's worryin' about me.
- How's it goin' in there?
- Not so well.
Suppose it'd do Frank any good if I was to tell them the robbery was my idea?
No. No, there's nothing you or I or anybody can do.
We've just got to wait and hope.
Yeah? Well, we wouldn't be doin' no hopin' or waitin' if it wasn't for you.
Why didn't you leave Frank alone?
What'd you have to keep after him for?
If you hadn't stuck your nose in it... we'd have got Bob Ford and nobody'd got Frank.
Now, on account of you, they're gonna hang him.
Raise your right hand, place your left hand on the Bible. Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- I do.
- Sit down.
- You're Frank James?
- No doubt about that.
Why are you here?
- Why?
- Yeah. You weren't captured.
- You weren't brought in on a fugitive warrant.
- I come in.
In other words, you're here voluntarily, eh?
As far as the State's concerned, you might still be at large.
I object.
That is a conclusion!
Objection sustained.
The witness will not be asked to speculate. You may proceed.
You came in voluntarily.
Why?
Well, they was aimin' to swing Pinky for somethin' he didn't do— something he didn't even know anything about— so I figured that—
So you figured you'd risk your own neck to save the life of a poor, innocent old darky.
Your Honor, I must protest!
I must protest, Your Honor.
The witness isn't being asked to give testimony. He's being led into argument.
The point is well-taken, but when a man is on trial for his life... the court is inclined to give wide latitude to the defense.
Now take it easy, Major. You'll have plenty of opportunity to make arguments.
- You needn't do it through the witness.
- I stand rebuked, Your Honor.
You did rob the express office, didn't you?
- Reckon I did.
- Mm-hmm. What'd you do with the money?
- Used it huntin' the Fords.
- No other purpose?
No. It was McCoy money got Jesse murdered, so I took McCoy money.
- Your Honor!
- Major, I want to be fair with you.
In fact, I've been leaning over backwards to be fair, but—
It's all right, Your Honor. I'm finished with the witness. McCoy can have him. I-I—
I mean— I mean, uh— I mean McCoy's man.
No, no, no, doggone it.
I— I mean the prosecuting attorney.
- I'm— I'm sorry, Your Honor, but my tongue got twisted.
- You say you didn't kill the watchman, Wilson.
- I had no reason.
- Do you always need a reason for killing?
- Don't you?
I'm not on trial. Your accomplice could've shot Wilson, couldn't he?
- Yeah, could have.
- Ah.
But he didn't.
Shot from the outside got Wilson.
I suggest that you caused the death of the watchman... either directly or by using him as a shield in making your escape.
Can't arrest you for suggestin', but tain't so.
Tell me... just where was the watchman,
Wilson, when he was hit?
Well, let me see. I think he—
Never mind what you think.
Where was he?
Sorry. I can't talk without thinkin', not bein' a lawyer.
Your name is
Breckenridge Jackson?
- Colonel Breckenridge Jackson, sir.
- Well, Colonel Jackson.
- Colonel Breckenridge Jackson, sir.
- Well, Colonel Jackson.
You say that you've known
Frank James for many years.
- Are you doubtin' my word, sir?
- I merely asked you a question, sir.
I answered for my friend, the major... and you, sir, were in the room at the same time.
- Are you deef?
- My hearing is perfectly good.
Very well. Then I advise you, sir, to pay attention to what's goin' on in this here courtroom.
Please answer all questions put to you, directly and without discussion.
- As a character witness—
- I shall do as you wish, sir.
There is no favor I can refuse the man who led the courageous attack at Ball's Bluff.
- All right, all right, but let's get on.
- Very well, sir.
What do you want to know, Yankee?
Now, Colonel—
When did you first meet Frank James?
As a boy of 14 or 15, when he first joined up.
- You mean when he joined Quantrill's guerrillas?
- Guerrillas?
- Did I hear you say guerrillas?
- I believe they're generally known as such.
Only to those who cravenly fled before them.
The finest cavalry in war, sir.
The flower of Southern horse.
- Why, at the battle ofThree Oaks—
- Come, come, come.
Let's get on with the trial.
Am I to tolerate insults to the South?
Well, I don't feel insulted.
The next question.
I did have a number of questions to ask this witness, Your Honor... but rather than refight the entire rebellion—
Rebellion, did you say, sir?
If you are, by any chance... referring to the late unpleasantness between the States... that, sir, was a war for the Southern Confederacy.
That isn't what they call it where I come from.
Well, that's what this court calls it, and let the record so show.
- You may proceed.
- State rests.
Yankee.
As to the robbery itself,
I need say nothing.
Frank James admits that with an unknown accomplice, he broke into the express office... cracked open the strongbox and escaped with the contents.
May I assume that even my learned opponent will agree... that breaking into a place and robbing it is a punishable offense.
- Go on, talk to the jury.
They have to listen to you.
But Frank James's crime did not end with robbery.
There was murder as well—
foul, bloody murder...
murder that cries aloud for
justice against its perpetrator.
Frank James killed the watchman, Wilson... and you, as honest men... will see that he pays for his crime at the end of a rope.
- It's all my fault.
- I wouldn't feel that way about it if I was you.
After all, you only did what you thought was right.
When I talked to Frank in Denver...
I was thinking only of an innocent man condemned to death.
I didn't think that perhaps
I was sending Frank to his death.
- What business was it of mine?
- Now listen, Frank's not going to his death.
Ten years, I figure, maybe 15.
If I only hadn't persuaded him.
My dear, I'm afraid you're overcalculatin' your powers of persuasion.
You figure it was your persuasion that made him come in, don't you, huh?
Well, you're mistaken.
He'd have come in and when he did, even if he'd never met you.
You're saying that to make feel better.
No, no, no. I'm not.
I'm saying it because it's the truth.
Frank would never have let Pinky die.
You see, l— I know him better than you do.
Well, it's time to be gettin' back to court.
Come along.
You see, I think—
Frank had only one thought:
To avenge the cowardly murder of his brother Jesse.
But to get on the track of the Fords
he needed money, and he had none.
- You boys know how rich you get workin' a rocky Ozark farm.
So, in desperation, and only as a last resort, did Frank turn to robbery.
But let us see.
Did he rob a bank containing the thrifty savings of the poor? No.
Did he rob an honest shopkeeper? No.
He took money from the railroad... the railroad that had caused the death of his mother and his brother.
The railroad that stole your lands and drove you from your farms, the railroad—
- I object!
- Your objection is well-taken.
Now let me remind you,
Major, again.
The St. Louis Midland is not on trial in this court.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Now just try and forget what I said about the railroad.
And there is no evidence whatsoever that Wilson, the night watchman... was killed by a bullet from a.44.
There is more than a reasonable doubt about it... since even the autopsy surgeon himself couldn't tell.
Now this is the weapon Frank James had when he surrendered... and the weapon he has always carried.
I know 'cause I gave it to him myself the day he went to join Quantrill.
You see the initials on it— F.J. — and the date. Here. See here. Here.
- This is very irregular, Your Honor.
The evidence is in.
- Let him proceed.
Your Honor.
This weapon of Frank's has a very interesting history. Yes, sir, right from the start.
Its first bullets were fired at those dad-blasted Kansas jayhawkers... when they come a-raidin' here.
You remember that, don't you, Ira?
Next, this weapon was used on the sneakin', thievin' Yankees that burned Hickoryville.
Saved your barn and your horses, eh, Luke?
What are we trying here, Frank James or his gun?
This is also the weapon that stampeded the blasted blue-bellies at Three Oaks... and cleared Clay County forever of the pesky invaders.
Now tell them how many innocent men that gun laid low.
There is no innocent blood on this weapon.
I'm proud of every bullet fired from it. This weapon—
L— I'm sorry, Your Honor. L—
I didn't know it was loaded.
Perhaps your client didn't either when he fired at the watchman.
And if the jury believe that any witness has willfully sworn falsely...
to any material fact,
thejury is at liberty to discard...
and disregard the testimony
of such witness.
And in determining
the credibility of any witness...
thejury may take into consideration
his or her moral character...
as disclosed by the evidence
developed at the trial.
And if on account ofhis or her moral
turpitude or other criminal acts...
if any, thejury regard him or her
as untrustworthy ofbelief.'...
they are at liberty to disregard
and reject the whole of such testimony...
although a part ofhis other testimony...
may be corroborated
by other evidence in the case.
- Fifth—
- What's he doing here?
Thejury is instructed
that by the statutes of—
- What's he doing here?
- Guess he wants to be in at the kill.
 That is the law,
gentlemen, and here are the facts.
The defendant admits—yes, freely admits
that he robbed the express office.
Not now, son. Not now!
Thus your duty as to that count
in the indictment is plain. Uh—
As to the defendant's reasons for robbing the express office... you will attach no weight to them whatever.
As to whether murder was committed
in the course of the robbery...
that you will determine
by the evidence.
But bear this in mind: No matter
what has been said in this courtroom... you and you only are the final judges of the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
The jury will now retire to its deliberations.
Maybe not murder, but there's no question of a conviction on the robbery charge.
I wish, though, that Bob Ford hadn't come here.
- Your Honor?
- Yes?
- Do we have to leave the box?
- Not if you've reached a verdict.
- We have, Your Honor.
- And what is the verdict?
We find the defendant,
Frank James, not guilty of anything.
We licked them, the dad-blasted Yankees!
We licked them!
Let go ofhim, you lunkheads!
Keep cool, son. Keep cool.
Please! Please!
You're free, Frank, free!
You can do as you please, go where you want.
If you kill him, you'll have to stand trial again.
- You mustn't, Frank. You mustn't!
- I got to.
Frank, if you ever want to see me again—
Bob Ford! They got him!
They got him!
I tried to get him for you, Frank, but...
'pears like he got me.
I think I plugged him too, but I ain't sure.
If I was,
I wouldn't feel so bad.
- Anybody gettin' a doctor?
- He's coming.
- Frank?
- Yeah?
I guess you and Pinky can take care of the farm.
No, we can't, Clem. We got to have you.
We need you for the harvestin'.
Ain't a man in the county can do a day's work like you. We gotta have you.
All right, Frank, but... I'm awful tired.
Maybe if— if I rest up a bit—
Buck up, son. You can't go to sleep now.
You got a job to do.
Clem.
Anybody see which way Ford went?
Yeah, he ducked in that livery barn over there.
Are you comin' out, or am I comin' in?
That's the other one, Jesse.
"In granting a full pardon to Frank James...
"he has shown himself to be a man...
"who acts in full accord...
"with the wishes of the people.
"Anybody who don't vote for him...
"at the next election...
- ought to be taken out"—
- "And shot down like a dog."
Yeah. Huh? Yeah, and put it on the front page in 12-point boldface.
I don't suppose you'll ever get out to Denver again.
Oh, can't tell.
Mighty pretty country 'round there.
Yeah, it kind of does somethin' to you... to see the sun come up mornings over the mountains.
- Yep, there's lots I like about Denver.
- I'm glad.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Deep in the mountains of Colorado is the Royal Gorge of the Arkansas River, tamed by the steepest tramway in the world, climbing up from the depths, past 1,550 feet of sheer red rock to the canyon rim.
A suspension bridge spans the gorge, its roadways soaring higher in the air than the topmost tip of the Empire State Building.
Near the Royal Gorge is the town that is the subject of this true story, a town that has seen
United States Cavalry, mountain men, beaver hunters,
Indian scouts, gold seekers.
Settled by covered-wagon pioneers, cowhands, miners, by hunters, trappers, and farmers, it is today the home of their grandsons and daughters, and a typical
Western community.
Cañon City, population 7,000.
Elevation, one mile and
63 feet above sea level.
A city of small homes that is set in a beautiful and rugged land of mountains and canyons, a land that smiles in summer, in winter, is often grim with blizzards.
But within Cañon City, there is another city, a grim place of gray stone walls... of watchtowers, of armed guards... the Colorado
State Penitentiary.
Established in 1868 as a territorial prison by the Federal Government, it became the state penitentiary when Colorado was admitted into the Union in 1876.
It has been a going business ever since and a home for those who like to have their own way too much and have taken forbidden steps to achieve their aims.
All kinds are here-- murderers, kidnappers, thieves, robbers, embezzlers.
The warden of a penal institution has a grave responsibility-- absolute control over the lives and futures of hundreds of men.
To the tough-minded, he must be tougher.
To those who show promise and a desire to make good again in society, he must be understanding.
Meet Warden Roy Best.
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
Have a chair.
Thank you, I will.
Warden, tell me, what's the population of this prison?
Uh, something over 1,200.
And how many of those men are doing life?
It's better than 10%.
And what's the--
Chris.
Has Chris got a bad temper?
Well, he's allergic to quick moves.
Then I won't make any sudden moves.
I was about to ask, what's the toughest job in prison?
Well, naturally,
I think mine.
It must be a heavy responsibility.
You don't show it.
Nevertheless, it's always with you.
No doubt.
You must have some inmates with interesting stories in here.
Well, we think we have.
Let's go and meet some of them.
I'd like to, very much.
These men, behind walls, disciplined, subject to routine, deprived of freedom, wearing prison gray, are still human beings-- sons and husbands and fathers.
In spite of a few who are untamable, because of the many who can be helped, modern penology recognizes man's need of work and furnishes tools and machinery.
Here in the knitting mill, prisoners make socks and underwear for all inmates and learn a trade that will aid them after release.
And here in the prison tailor shop, inmates manufacture work clothing and going-away suits.
Hey, that looks like a good fit.
You'd never know where it came from.
I'm getting out of here next week.
Congratulations.
Where do you go?
To Denver.
My wife will meet me at the train.
She's waited 12 years-- stuck by me, in spite of everything.
Hey, look, when they press the coat, don't let 'em put a crease in the sleeve.
Other inmates work in the stamping mill, making state license plates and road signs.
In the West, when they say something, they're not fooling.
Let's ask this old timer a few questions.
What's your name?
Joe Bundy.
Been here long?
Oh, quite a piece.
Since 1897.
50 years.
Aren't you about due for a parole?
They can keep it.
Where would I go?
Who'd want me?
That's the worst punishment of all-- when nobody wants you.
Yep.
Here, inmates with special skills and an artistic bent work at making hooked rugs.
Let's talk to this boy.
What's your name, son?
Carlo Nova.
And how old are you?
14 years old.
What crime were you convicted of?
Murder.
What's your sentence?
20 years to 30 years.
(narrator) Warden Best has recommended this inmate for parole.
The man has proven himself.
Our next stop is the gymnasium.
Mr. Frady, you're athletic instructor for the prison, aren't you?
Yes.
How long have you been here?
I came here when I was 23, convicted of murder.
And you got life?
I got death.
Four hours before I was to die in the gas chamber, the warden got my sentence commuted.
I see.
And do you expect to be paroled?
Yes, in '49.
I'm going to show the world that the warden made no mistake when he gave me back my life.
In the afternoon, the work details return from their labors on Quarry Hill.
The prison day begins early and ends early.
Although familiarity and routine can breed contempt, the authorities never forget that these men are here against their will.
All prisoners are checked for contraband on their return from work.
This electronic frisker sounds an alarm whenever anyone carries a metal object past it.
The robot guard gets alarmed over anything metallic, harmless or not, and it can be set so fine that it will announce the nails in your shoes.
Immediately after chow, the 1,200 inmates march into the cell house, and by 5 p.m., while it is still daylight, are locked away in their cells for the long night.
All over the prison, in the other cell houses, men are filing along the galleries, standing before their cell doors.
On signal, the cell doors are opened by the bar men.
These are inmate trustees, and one bar man handles each tier of cells.
Again, on signal, the bar men close the cells.
These are the hardest hours of each prison day, when a man is left alone with his thoughts of what has been, of what might have been.
As another round of routine ends, every man behind these bars is dreaming of only one day-- the day of freedom.
This is Johnson, a long-termer.
Perhaps the boat model is, to him, a symbol of the open sea, of freedom to roam, of hope.
His cell neighbor is Sherbondy, in for the killing of an officer.
He was committed when he was 17.
He's now 29.
How is the new boat coming?
Great.
She'll soon be ready to launch.
Is that all you're building?
A boat?
Why?
I know when something's going on.
Wise guy, huh?
You'll never make it.
I'm not in this alone.
We've got every angle figured.
We can't miss.
That's what they all think.
Look at Smalley,
Hathaway, Lavergne.
They tried it more than once, and they're still here.
Murray made it.
He was out five years.
And they found him and brought him back.
So, we don't make the same mistakes.
Now, get this.
Hope springs eternal, they say, and never more so than for those in prison.
Take Johnson, for instance-- the boat builder.
For months, he's been hoping.
For weeks, planning.
And now, he's decided to put those plans into operation.
It's just a matter of brains and of guts, and of a lot of scheming and a little luck.
Hi, Charlie.
Oh, hello, Willie.
Hi, Harry.
Nice weather for December.
Yeah, don't you just love the climate here?
Got any souvenirs?
Yeah.
Faith.
Hope.
This one's for charity.
They tell me you've got a load for me.
Yeah.
Take this control panel down to the desk sergeant's office.
I've got orders to install it this afternoon.
Nice work.
Sure, they can put you behind bars.
Sure, they can set men to watch you, men with tear-gas billies and guns.
Sure, they can shove you around and stick a number on you and make you walk with your arms folded, but they can't keep you from having buddies, like New, a sharp little guy who'll try anything and always knows the score.
And there are others-- a fighting dozen of them.
Warden Best, with his big hat and his dogs and his tough guards.
There are always ways, if a man uses his head, and if he picks his pals.
So much for those who plot and plan.
Modern prison science follows the doctrine that besides work, man-- even man in prison-- must have recreation.
Once a week, a movie is shown in the auditorium, selected, of course, and properly approved, but something of the outside world, nevertheless-- something to be thought over and remembered and discussed during the coming week.
I found the one-reeler.
Ah, just in time.
The feature's just beginning.
Look, I know how you feel about what
I told you, but--
I don't want any part of it.
Okay, if you want to rot in this joint, that's your business, but that doesn't mean you can't help us out.
I've got some stuff hidden in my cell that I've got to get rid of for the time being.
I won't touch it.
I counted on you as a friend, kid.
Look, I told you,
I don't want to get mixed up in anything.
Now, keep away from me, will ya?
Beat it!
What'd he say?
No dice.
The date's been set.
We go the 30th.
Sure.
We need that guy.
He's got the one spot where the hitters will be safe.
Why don't you talk to him?
I will.
Stop worrying.
He'll be with us.
I'm in on the break.
Yeah?
How do you feel about it by now?
I haven't changed.
You can't get away with it.
Seconds?
Yeah, more corn.
What you got to lose?
You're doing life.
Look, you don't need me.
We've got a special job for you.
I might be paroled in a few years.
Don't be a mug.
You killed a copper.
I've got a date in your department this afternoon.
Be seeing you then.
I understand you have a loose connection in the darkroom.
That's right.
Is it okay to go in?
Wait a minute.
Is it all right to open the door?
Yeah.
Where's your trouble?
Fuse box.
You can turn the lights on.
Quite a nice little set-up you've got here.
Quiet, probably lonesome.
With the clean record you've built up, they leave you pretty much alone, don't they?
I get along.
I mind my own business.
Lone wolf.
It doesn't pay.
That's why they say, in jail, you should work together.
Okay, it's fixed.
Just burned out.
The whole building needs going over.
All right to turn the lights out now?
I want to load some film.
Okay.
Use your head, kid.
A man would better be dead than locked up all his life.
Come on, straighten up a little.
Yes, Sherbondy, a special job for you.
You're in this, whether you like it or not.
They need you.
You control the best hiding place in the prison.
No one can enter the darkroom without knocking, not even the guards.
Might spoil a batch of prints or X-ray negatives.
The officers trust you, would never suspect you of hiding murder weapons.
Yes, Sherbondy, you've been taken.
Sherbondy, we want to come in.
Oh, uh-- uh, just a minute, till I put these prints away, will ya?
Okay.
Is that X-ray film ready yet?
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, I think so.
Here you are, Joe.
Yeah, the doc wants it.
If you think I'll dummy up on a rap like this, you're crazy.
Call a screw.
Tell them they'd come to plant it on you.
Would he believe you?
Would the warden?
No, he'd stick you in a hole from now on.
How do you know those guns will shoot?
I'd stake my life on it.
Besides, we'll grab tear-gas guns from the guards.
They take a 12-gauge shell.
Then we'll hail when we go.
When we go.
When's that?
The 30th.
How do you expect to get through the gate?
It's all doped out.
Relax, Jimmy.
We'll tip you off when it's time to pack your weekend bag.
How's the kid, huh?
How's Bob?
Is he okay?
He's well.
Look, I shot this last Sunday.
Gee, he looks bigger.
He is.
I never saw a child grow so fast.
Honey, he takes after you more and more every day.
You mean, he--
Oh, no.
Aw, the little son of a gun.
Gee, Billy, it's good to see you again.
Three years.
Keep it down.
I got the message you sent by that guy who was paroled last month.
Yeah?
I did everything he told me.
You didn't use your real name?
No, no, a phony.
Good.
Like you said I should.
He said everything had to be ready by the 30th.
Don't mention that date in here.
But why?
Shh!
Mrs. Wilson?
Yes?
The captain would like to see you a minute before you have your visit.
What's the matter?
Is anything wrong?
Well, I don't know.
He'll tell you all about it.
This way, please.
You're a smart kid, May.
Just lay low and wait.
I'll be seeing you on the outside.
But, Billy, you've got two more years to go in here.
Look, I can't talk now, but there's a deal coming off, and I'm gonna cut in on it.
Don't take any chances.
Forget it.
Talk about something else.
Say, uh, how's your old lady?
Oh, she's swell.
You understand,
Mrs. Wilson, what I told you about your brother is for his own good.
Yes, of course.
You tell him what I said, but put it in your own way.
You may save the boy a lot of trouble.
I understand.
I'll talk to him.
Thank you very much, captain.
It's all right.
You can see him now.
I'll send him in.
The captain spoke well of you, Jimmy.
He says you have a clean record so far and that you're doing a good job in the projection booth and in the darkroom too.
But I think there's one thing you might have forgotten.
What's that?
You kept bad company when you were a kid, Jimmy, and that's why you're here.
That sort of thing can happen to you on the inside as well as on the outside.
He says you're keeping bad company again.
What did he mean by that?
He meant you've-- you've made the wrong kind of friends in prison.
You've got to be careful,
Jimmy.
Don't forget, you're doing time for murder.
The fact that you were 17 when you were sentenced can work in your favor, but if you get into trouble now, they might keep you here for life.
But if I thought there was some chance for parole, ma-- maybe a few years, even--
There is a chance, Jimmy.
Did he say that?
Yes.
Did he say when?
Well, if you keep your record clean, as you have in the past, it's quite possible you might be out of here within ten years.
Ten years?
That's right.
Oh, you've taken so much, Jimmy.
You can take that, can't you?
I suppose
I'll have to, sis.
So long, sis.
Open.
Keep working on Sherbondy.
Sure, but what worries me is how we're gonna get these six guys out of solitary.
We can't go without 'em.
We'll get 'em out.
But how?
We can't even talk to 'em.
We can't even get near 'em when they're in solitary.
Take it easy.
I'll get to them.
Seconds out.
(narrator) This is cell house six, the hotspot of the prison.
Over 200 of the hardest inmates call it home, and for the six most case-hardened of these, there is a block of cells known as solitary--
Little Siberia.
Next time you threaten an officer, the warden will keep you in here for the rest of your time.
Go peddle your fish, screw.
Tough guy, huh?
You ought to know.
You don't seem to be happy unless you're here in Siberia with your six pals.
Well, you'll get a good dose of it this time.
If 60 days don't cool you off,
I'll see that you get some more.
And that goes for the rest of you hyenas.
Who'd you threaten?
Gray himself.
Only next time, I won't stop with a threat.
Got any news for us?
Plenty.
Everything's set.
Did you bring anything with you?
You think I got myself buried in here to sit around for 60 days?
I got a little Christmas present for you, Tolley.
Yeah?
And one for myself.
We sweat blood to get these things.
If Gray finds 'em, we're sunk.
I think we've got a perfect set-up.
If I give you the dope, you could pass it on to the other guys.
Okay.
Joe, is it okay if I stay in from the main line tonight?
I don't feel so good.
Maybe I scored a miss.
My stomach's upset.
Okay.
Thanks.
The inmates are on their way to chow-- all but the six in solitary.
The cell house is almost deserted.
It is Carl Schwartzmiller, the ringleader, who makes the first open assault against authority, takes the first step toward freedom.
That noisy fan is noisy on purpose.
Organized carefully, neglected to oil it for several weeks, the racket it makes will cover for them.
The planning is over.
It's time for action.
It's all set.
Now, there can be no wavering, no turning back, no stopping.
Whatever comes, they must continue on the course they have chosen.
Hi, Warden.
Hi, Tim.
Hi, Paddy.
Hi.
You want to take a hand in this, Roy?
I can't, doc.
I went upstairs to a meeting, and I'm on my way back to prison.
You're wanted on the telephone, doctor.
The party says it's urgent.
Who's calling?
Well, they didn't say, sir.
They only said it's-- it's liable to happen any minute.
Holy smoke!
Roy, you'd better sit down and take my hand.
Sit down, Paddy.
Well, you forced me to it.
All right.
What are we playing?
Don't bring your topic here.
Aw, why do you keep handing me the dope one piece at a time?
I want to know the whole set-up.
What happens next?
We sic guys on the north perimeter and duck out any time we like.
The eight guys handling the locking bars to number six always leave ahead of the others.
We go when they go.
Where are the heaters?
Outside.
There go the bar men now.
Okay, let's go.
The usual routine-- the bar men returning early from mess.
Everything will be okay-- if some sharp guard doesn't count them, discover two more than there should be.
If only Johnson and Sherbondy can back into cell house six on time.
In the cell house,
Morgan creeps into position, carefully, cautiously.
There must be no slip-up now.
This has been planned for weeks and months, all for these few minutes of this day.
Everything depends upon clockwork position, on every man doing his job right.
Morgan will be the first to attack.
His target has been picked.
Here come the bar men.
Routine.
Everything looks normal.
The sally port closes behind them.
Johnson and Sherbondy are still with them.
They haven't been noticed.
What are you men doing here?
Tolley and Schwartzmiller are on time.
They've sawed their way out of Little Siberia.
Did you get the key to the bar cage?
Yeah, take it.
(narrator) Now, to spring the other men in Little Siberia, the toughest crew in the whole prison.
They'll have to hurry.
Things are taking longer than they'd planned.
If the other prisoners get back from mess too soon, everything could go wrong.
The cell house six crowd is on their way back from mess.
200 guys.
What'll do we do with them?
Oh, leave it to me,
I'll handle it.
Open that door.
Come on, get the uniforms off these guys.
Don't gang up, you guys!
Keep that line moving!
Go on!
March to your cells, same as always!
Keep moving!
Keep quiet!
You guys don't want to forget, this thing fires tear-gas shells.
First guy that opens his yap to yell gets a load of it right in their mouth.
This is a break.
We've got a good chance.
Any of you guys want to go along, just say so.
Those who don't, keep your mouths shut and lay low!
I'm doing life now.
I don't need no extra ten.
Come on, there's nothing to look at.
Get back in your holes!
Hey, Schwartzmiller.
Huh?
Don't forget, we're in on this.
Yeah, I know-- you and your friend here.
Go on, keep moving!
Here comes Clark to make the count.
Outside, it's beginning to snow-- the birth of a blizzard.
Nonez speaking.
This is Clark in cell house six.
McLean's had a stroke.
Tell him to send
Captain Gentry.
You'd better get a hold of the captain.
Send him up right away.
He can't get Gentry.
They're sending another man.
Grab the guard when he comes in.
You mean, we're gonna wait for him?
Let's take the men we've got and get out of here.
We haven't got enough.
Bring those other screws out.
We need all the guards we can pick up.
We gotta use 'em for cover when we hit the gate.
The tower guards will blast us if we don't.
They won't even see us in the snow.
What's the matter with you suckers?
Haven't you got any guts?
Shut up!
Come on, screw, you're going for a little trip!
Go on, get Gray out here!
We can't take
Joe Gray with us.
Why not?
Why, Schwartzmiller half killed him.
We don't have to die on our hands.
Who says we don't?
We don't need Gray.
The guy can't even walk.
So, what good is he?
I'll finish the job on it.
No!
Leave him alone.
Are you telling me what to do?
Yeah, I'm telling you.
I didn't ask in on this party, see?
But now that I'm in on it,
I'm not gonna let you foul it up just to satisfy a personal grudge.
Listen, this goes for all you guys!
Here's another boyfriend to take along.
Are we set?
Yeah.
Yeah.
If we clear the yard, we're on our way.
Come on, we want the keys to the north gate.
I haven't got it.
You're lying.
I'm not.
It's kept during daytimes, never at night.
We can't wait for the key!
They'll see us in a minute and start shooting!
Maybe we can climb this thing.
Let me at that lock!
Keep back, you guys!
They found this key on Biggs.
See if it fits!
Got it!
It's okay!
The gate's open!
McNally speaking.
What?
No, there's no
"Hill Gang" on tonight.
Why should there be?
McNally, there's been a break!
12 men gone,
Joe Gray nearly killed!
Get me the warden!
The dread sound of the prison whistle, announcing a break, warning Cañon City.
The people hurry for their homes, to protect their families, to prepare for whatever may be coming, for the blast of that whistle always means trouble, suffering, bloodshed, death.
Cañon City can never forget the last time it blew-- a night of horror,
12 dead-- seven guards, five convicts.
Tonight, another break, a blizzard setting in and a tornado of desperate men at large.
The people get ready for anything and gather their children into their homes.
Warden Best hurries back to the prison, through the storm, to take command, to muster his forces.
Rifles and ammunition are issued for the manhunt.
The state police have been alerted.
A statewide alarm is out.
These three guards can't go any farther.
All right, we'll leave 'em here.
Come on.
The cops!
Break it up!
Scatter!
Even a newsboy's whistle means danger.
All of Cañon City is stirring like a nest of hornets.
People have one goal-- to get to the safety of their homes.
The fugitives have scattered.
One group got away in a laundry truck.
Others steal cars, like Schwartzmiller and his group.
The keys are still in it, the engine still warm.
Get in the back, screw!
Listen, men, you all know the country.
It's rough outside tonight, and you're dealing with some rough men.
If possible, bring 'em in alive, but don't take any chances.
That's all.
Okay, warden.
Let's go, fellas.
Nice driving, Curt.
You did all right.
I'd like to see you do as good on a night like this.
Where's the prison dairy farm?
About a mile up the road.
You may find a car there, but you're wrong in thinking you'll get guns.
They keep 'em locked up in a vault.
That won't stop us.
Not tonight.
We'd better get off the road.
We'll go through that field.
No matter how we go, we leave tracks in the snow.
That's not a bad thought for a city guy, but I beat you to it.
Go ahead and walk in single file.
I'll follow you and wipe the tracks away.
The wind'll do the rest, stupid.
Hey, where are you trying to take us?
This isn't the dairy farm.
I know.
It's not far from here.
But I thought we'd go in here and get warm.
Whose place is this?
A family by the name of Oliver.
Do they know you?
No, I don't think so.
Maybe they got a car.
Yeah, we'll find out.
You keep your mouth shut.
Excuse us for tracking in the snow.
Mrs. Oliver?
Why didn't you knock?
You scared me half to death.
I'm sorry.
You see, we're in a hurry.
We're officers from the pen.
I suppose you heard about the prison break.
Yes, we heard it on the radio.
You got a phone?
No.
No.
Well, uh, our car was wrecked, and we lost some guns.
We'd like to borrow some of yours, and your car too, if you don't mind.
Well, I don't know.
Now, listen he--
Uh, you've got guns, haven't you?
Uh, yes.
Yes, we've got guns.
A .38 pistol and a .22 rifle.
I'll get 'em for you.
That's very nice of you, friend.
We want ammunition too.
Go get yourself warmed up.
Poor guy got a chill when the car turned over.
Ripped the coat right off his back.
Seems to me, you men should have on overcoats in this kind of weather.
Well...
How'd you come to lose your guns?
They got smashed in the wreck.
Of course, we've still got these tear-gas billies.
They're loaded with shotgun shells.
They'd make a nasty hole in a person.
Yes, they would.
Dear me.
Where are the keys to your car, Mrs. Oliver?
The car won't start.
What do you mean, it won't start?
Well, the engine's cold.
The battery's run down.
Now, don't give us that!
Take it easy, chum.
Well, you-- it wouldn't start for me.
You can try it yourself, if you want to.
Here are the keys.
It's out by the barn.
Thanks.
Oh, don't mind him.
He's got a nervous disposition.
I wish he'd control it.
I've got one too.
You must have been half frozen.
(Schwartzmiller) Yeah, but he feels a whole lot better now.
Sit down, boys.
 Bulletin--
The 12 escaped convicts 
 are still at large.
These men are armed 
 and dangerous.
Four prison officials 
injured by the escapees have been taken 
 to the hospital.
One is near death.
Officer Winston Williams, kidnapped as a hostage, 
 is missing.
It is not yet known 
 what has become of him.
You were right, lady.
Your stinkin' car won't start!
Looks like the whole blasted country's froze up.
How do we get to the dairy farm from here?
You can't miss it.
You follow the road out front.
You'll come to Superintendent
Higgins' house first.
Where is
Higgins' office?
In the farm dormitory, a couple of hundred feet from the house.
One of us had better stay here, just in case.
I'll stay.
Get a car and pick me up here.
Keep an eye on this guy before he goes nuts.
Don't forget to come back!
I'll come back!
Funny-- if you're prison guards, you don't know where the dairy farm is.
We're new on the job,
Mr. Oliver.
We don't know this country yet.
Then how can you go hunting escaped convicts?
I...
I was just getting supper.
I'm sure you wouldn't object to a nice, hot cup of cocoa.
You'd like one, wouldn't you, Mr. Williams?
Hey!
You said these people didn't know you.
We don't, but we heard the radio.
Yeah, he's Williams, and we're cons.
Sit down, Mr. Oliver.
Take it easy.
Anything else you'd like?
Yeah, some fruit, maybe.
Oranges.
I've got some.
You know, you don't look like a criminal.
I'm not.
They got the wrong man.
Get the cocoa.
12 men?
My goodness, what time did it happen?
No, I didn't know a thing about it.
Lonnie's been writing letters since suppertime, and we haven't had the radio on.
He stepped over to the farm dormitory.
Maybe he's heard something about it.
I'll talk to him and call you back.
Good-bye.
Hello?
Oh, it's you, Minnie.
Yeah, I heard about it.
The boys here in the dormitory got it over the radio.
That's right, 12 of the toughest cons in the pen.
You be careful, now.
Don't worry about me.
Wait a minute.
There's someone at the door.
Oh, it's all right,
Lonnie.
It's two guards from the prison.
They likely want to use the phone.
I'll call you back.
Well, I guess
I don't know you boys.
No, I guess you don't.
You're from the prison, aren't you?
We're from the prison, all right.
We work on the graveyard shift.
They got us out of bed to chase the cons that made a break.
I just heard about it.
Terrible, wasn't it?
Yeah, worst break since '29.
Oh, the only break since '29.
But Roy Best will get them back.
So he says.
Where's your husband,
Mrs. Higgins?
He's over to the farm dormitory.
Where's that?
Just down the road a beat.
You can see it from here.
Funny, you don't know where the dormitory is, if you're prison guards!
Never mind what we are!
Our car broke down.
We want you to get your car out and drive us to Pueblo.
Boys, I couldn't take my car out on a night like this.
The roads are covered with ice.
Those rifles belong to my son.
Where does he keep his ammunition?
I don't know anything about that.
We've got no time to fool around with you.
We want that ammunition, and we want your car, and you're gonna drive it.
Now, where is it?
Locked in the garage.
Where are the keys?
I don't know that, either.
You better not lie to us!
This guy's a little upset, but I'm not, see?
I'm glad to hear that.
You're convicts, aren't you?
Yeah.
I was doing life for murder.
Get the angle?
I guess I do.
Then go across.
All right.
My husband changed his clothes before he went out.
He left his other things in the bedroom closet.
Maybe the car keys are in his pocket.
I'll go see.
You'll do that.
We'll be--
Right behind you.
The keys must be somewhere among his clothes, but I'll have to hunt for them.
He's like most men-- no system whatever.
Always losing his keys.
He's liable to drop 'em any old place.
Find 'em-- that's all we want.
You'd think a man would have one place for his things, but not Lonnie.
Anytime he wants anything, he's got to go digging all through his pockets.
Keep quiet!
You make me stop talking,
I'll only start yelling.
Then you will be mad!
I'm doing the best I can.
Here they are.
Give 'em here!
That's what
I'm trying to do!
You make me so nervous,
I can't hang onto anything!
Okay, come on.
Let's get out of here.
All right, all right,
I'm coming as fast as I can.
Oh!
Hello?
Hello?
Is that you, Minnie?
If that gun had been loaded, you'd have killed us both!
That's what you'd do to me!
Why does that phone keep ringing?
You'll find out!
Wait a minute!
She knows the roads, and we don't!
Come on, you!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, Lonnie!
Oh, Lonnie!
This is station KRLN, broadcasting from 
 Warden Best's office.
Two of the escaped convicts 
have been reported in the vicinity 
 of the Lon Higgins home.
Help is on its way there 
 now.
All citizens are urged 
to keep off the streets, stay in your homes, and report 
 anything suspicious.
Looks like your friends may not come back.
Yeah, it looks like it.
More cocoa?
No, thanks.
Cigarette, Williams?
Yeah, thanks.
Hey, wait a minute.
Sit down.
Careful about those sudden moves, Williams.
Why don't you go to bed, Ethel?
What good would I do in bed?
Do you think
I could sleep?
He doesn't expect you to sleep.
He figures you could signal for help from the bedroom window.
You stay right here with us and see the fun.
(Mrs. Oliver) You know, there's one thing I'm curious about.
Yeah, go ahead and ask me.
I'll wring your whole towel dry.
You seem to be an educated person.
Education seldom goes hand in hand with crime.
So, why did I become a criminal?
No, not that, but what were you charged with?
Well, this time,
I still have to commit murder.
The first time, it was grand theft auto.
Then, armed robbery, armed robbery again, then a parole violation, and an escape.
I'm still wanted in Illinois.
I've been in the can on and off since I was 20 years old.
Now tell me crime doesn't pay.
Well, it seems to pay the wardens.
Haven't you any ambitions?
Sure.
I want to commit the perfect crime.
You say you have
22 years to go.
That's bad enough.
Is this any better?
How could you take such a terrible chance?
I couldn't stand it around there.
The joint's full of cheap thieves.
What are you doing now, sister?
I'm gonna get a cup for myself.
Is it all right?
Yeah, but don't get me wrong, sister.
I'd kill to stay out of that joint.
You mean, it's bad there?
Well, not the way you see it, but you can't lock men up and expect them to stay put, not even if you feed 'em off gold plates.
They'll always fight to get out and take the gold plates with 'em.
Can't you get anything but the local station on this box?
We must have made the headlines on the major networks.
(radio announcer) Again, a bulletin from Warden Best's office.
Two of the escaped convicts, 
Smalley and Hathaway, have been returned 
 to the prison.
So far, five of 
the escaped convicts have been recaptured.
These men state that 
the break was planned and led by 
Richard Heilman, a life termer.
Heilman is still 
 at large.
Stay tuned to this station 
for information and warning 
 announcements.
Warden Best warns the people 
of Three Mile County to be on their guard.
Keep your doors locked.
Admit no strangers.
How do you like that?
Giving Heilman all the credit.
That dope had nothing to do with it.
I was the--
What are you doing?
Listening to the radio.
What do you got under your apron?
I thought you might like another orange.
Oh, thanks.
I can't stay here much longer.
The minute
I get out of sight, one of you would duck for a phone.
The best way would be to take you all with me, but I can't do that, because I got nothing to take you in.
I don't want to kill you.
I wouldn't like that.
So, I'll have to tie you all up but good, give myself plenty of time.
Meanwhile, the fires will go out, and we'll freeze.
That might kill us anyway.
It's tough, but that's the way it's got to be.
This isn't the place.
It's a half-mile down the road.
You see?
A half-truck full of officers, and they started coming to the house.
Just lucky they changed their mind.
I see.
I'll take those.
Aah!
Get me some rope!
Have you got him?
I've got him.
You're sure?
I'm sure.
Dear me,
I feel so funny.
What's the matter?
Has she fainted?
No.
Well, by golly, you should.
Meanwhile, New and Hernandez come to May's home for help.
Is this the house?
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
I heard about the break on the radio, but I never dreamed it--
We needed to wait till we got the chance.
There's no time for gab now.
We want to get rid of these rags, change our clothes.
Come on, quick.
Get-- get me an outfit for my friend.
Okay, Billy.
Well, is that a package?
Yeah, but look, ain't you worried about the cops?
You do the worrying.
Here.
These things will fix him up.
I'll go get your clothes packed.
Make yourself at home, Georgie.
How are you, Georgie?
Who else is in there?
Nobody.
How did you know we was here?
Ask the warden.
Okay, New, the party's over!
Hello.
Yes, the warden speaking.
Swell.
Yeah?
Where at?
Well, anybody hurt?
That's fine.
Bring him in.
They got New and Hernandez?
At the home of a girl who just moved to town.
I guess it pays to keep track of my boys' girlfriends.
Warden Best announces the capture 
of Carl Schwartzmiller after a fierce struggle in the farm home of 
 Mr. And Mrs. Lawrence Oliver.
Warden Best again 
warns you of the dangerous character 
 of these men.
Six are still at large--
Morgan, Heilman, 
 Freeman, Tolley,
Johnson, and Sherbondy.
Aah!
This is station KRLN, broadcasting from 
 Warden Best's office.
All citizens are urged...
Is the phone working?
Not since the storm.
How about it, mister?
You wouldn't be him, would you?
No.
Okay, sit down.
You're next, kid.
Take it easy, folks.
If anybody gets hurt, it'll be your own fault.
Remember, we're not here to play dominoes.
It's life and death to us, see?
And the same to you.
How many men in the family? myself and two boys.
Where's the other one?
He's in the Army.
Then he must have plenty of good, warm clothes.
We want 'em.
You-- get 'em, kid, and no foolin'.
You go with him.
Who are you snapping your fingers at?
At you, slug!
Go on, do what I tell you!
Next, we want some food to take with us.
That's your department, Mrs.--
What's your name?
Smith.
Okay, Smith, I want you to pack a big, fat lunch for three hungry guys.
Get going.
Just as you say.
You come with me,
Maxine.
Uh-uh, she stays here.
Take the kids.
Any liquor in the house?
We never touch it.
Heh.
I haven't touched it myself for ten years.
Put on a big pot of coffee,
Mrs. Smith.
You people must have some guns here, with shells for 'em.
We've got a couple of .22 rifles with ammunition.
.22s?
Look, I know you hunt deer in this county.
You've got something heavier than rabbit guns.
A couple of 30-30s stashed away someplace?
Where are they?
The .22s are all we've got.
Who do you think you're kidding?
What are you gonna do?
Hey!
You don't have to convince him you're tough.
Keep your hands off him!
Okay, pappy.
Show me where you keep your guns.
How old are you?
How far is this place from town?
Eight miles.
Why did you have to stop here?
Why didn't you go on?
Well, we ran out of gas.
Hey, nobody's gonna hurt you.
You're gonna be all right.
There's plenty of his stuff in there.
There's enough for all of us.
It'll feel good to get these wet things off.
My feets are frozen.
Come on, Freeman.
I'm okay.
All I need is another coat, so as I can ditch this uniform.
Keep your eyes on the road, Tolley.
You don't have to tell me to do that.
Where's the stuff, kid?
Right in here.
Are those all the guns they've got?
So he says.
Load 'em, will you?
We need some gas.
Most of you ranchers have storage tanks.
You've got one, ain't ya?
Yes, but it's empty.
We'll find out about that.
Show me where the tank is, honey.
It's just out there, at the side of the house.
Okay, come on, show me.
Take it easy, mister.
Sit down.
Sit down.
There's the tank.
Where?
Right there, in front of you.
Don't get excited.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I haven't seen anything like you since they locked me up.
Now, listen, kid.
You're pretty keen about your old man, ain't ya?
You mean, Mr. Smith?
He's not my father, he's my uncle.
Just the same, you wouldn't want him to get hurt.
No, of course not.
Then don't be that way!
Or I will get tough with you.
No, let me--
Stay where you are!
That means you too!
Where's Freeman?
He's out there.
Let me go!
Please, no!
Get inside, you!
Listen, chump,
I know how your mind works, and I don't like it!
I want you to leave these women alone!
You want me?
Hey!
Who's running this picnic?
That's what
I want to know.
Are you telling me what to do?
You dumb apes!
You've been framing this break ever since you've been buried in the can.
I didn't want any part of it, but you dragged me into it, see?
There's only one shell in this trick heater, but it's a 12-gauge, see, and it spreads.
Well, how about it?
You want a sample?
That's how you'll end-- killing each other.
Yeah, maybe you're right, lady, but we're not gonna mess up your dining room.
We're moving out of here, see?
I mean, now.
How do we travel without the gas?
You've got a car, haven't you, Smith?
Yes.
Then, that's how we travel.
Go on, outside.
Nice guys.
Come on, kid, show us where the car is.
If we run into trouble, we'll be back.
I guess you'd hate that.
I don't blame you.
Here's the sandwiches, with coffee.
Thanks.
Go on.
Tell the kid I'm--
Tell her nothing.
The two convicts who invaded the home of Mrs. Lon Higgins 
earlier this evening later shot at our 
prison officers at an isolated cabin, where they had 
 taken refuge.
One convict wounded, 
 the other killed.
No answer.
The lines are still down.
Ma, Ma, they're coming back!
Ma!
Oh, go back to room, children!
Go on!
Maxine, you stay with them!
Open up, or we're breaking in!
Oh, let them in!
They'll kill us if we--
Turn out the lights in the kitchen.
Hurry up!
You said they'd followed us here.
There's a half-truck coming!
There's gonna be shooting!
Lie down on the floor!
Not you, pappy.
I need you for a front.
Here they come!
Smith, are you in there?
Get on the floor!
Do you want to be killed?
Those men are gone.
You can come in now.
(narrator) Of the fugitives cornered at the Smith home, only Sherbondy makes good his getaway.
The whole countryside is alive with pursuers.
The blizzard is increasing in intensity, merciless alike to the hunters and the hunted.
Sherbondy finds a safe hiding place.
Tolley was captured, waiting in the freezing waters of a creek to hide his tracks.
He's badly frostbitten.
He's the ninth accounted for.
Freeman put up a savage struggle.
Wounded, defiant, cursing his captors, he's stopped in his tracks only by the knowledge that he will be shot down if he makes a move.
He's number ten to be checked off.
That leaves two still at large--
Sherbondy and Johnson, the boat builder.
Johnson is the one who decided to go it alone.
It's now 4:00 in the afternoon of the next day.
Johnson has been free for almost 24 hours-- running, hiding, going without food.
He battles his way up, out of the gorge.
It's a rock-wall trap.
Only number 12,
James Sherbondy, is still at large.
After 48 hours, hunger forces him from hiding.
Lock that door!
Pull down the shade!
I saw your pictures in the paper.
Yeah, you're Sherbondy.
You people got a phone here?
No phone.
See for yourself.
I will.
I don't want to hurt anybody, see?
But you've got to give me something to eat.
Well, I guess I could fry a couple of eggs for you.
Yeah, yeah, make if five eggs.
Rustle up some soup, coffee, milk.
Don't touch me!
(Mrs. Bauer) Leave him alone.
Your first name's James, isn't it?
Sit down, Jimmy.
And be careful of that cannon you've got there.
It's the craziest-lookin' thing I ever saw.
It'll kill.
It will?
My goodness, you must be starved.
Here, maybe this milk will hold you
'til I can get something ready for you.
One of the escaped convicts is dead.
Three of them are wounded.
They got ten of them the first night-- all but you and another fella.
The National Guard's been all out, looking for you-- and airplanes.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Land sakes.
I haven't eaten anything since supper,
Tuesday night.
I see you people have a car outside.
It's so cold, we can't get it started.
We'll get it started, somehow.
We're all gonna take a little trip.
Not now.
Toward morning.
Where are we going?
We'll head for Pueblo.
If we meet anybody,
I'll be on the floor, under a blanket, with this in my hand.
It'll be up to you to tell a good story.
How do you like 'em?
Straight up or turned over?
Straight up.
Okay.
They'll be ready in a minute.
What time is it?
Just past 7:00.
Take it easy, Jimmy.
Yeah.
Hey, pretty keen, ain't it?
Jerry got it for Christmas.
Yeah, I never had anything like this when I was a kid.
I used to practice with one whittled out of wood.
Machine Gun Kelly.
Makin' believe
I was blasting all the kids that pushed me around.
Gradually,
I got the idea that a guy could get places with a gun.
Oh, what a sucker idea that was.
You started early.
Yeah.
A kid begins with hoisting milk bottles off a doorstep, or apples from a fruit stand.
He finds it easy to get what other people have got.
First thing you know, he's got a heater in his hand, and one night, some guy with real guts scares the pants off him, and he pulls the trigger.
You killed a deputy, didn't you?
He was after me, and we shot it out.
A good man died, and I thought I was a great guy.
I hadn't got any sense that
I'd been in the can a while.
I might have gotten a parole in ten years, but I just couldn't wait that long.
He seems to have a fever.
He hasn't been well.
Do you mind if I take him and-- and put him to bed?
Oh, sure, go ahead.
Be quiet, sweetie, just for a few minutes.
Wait 'til Mommy sees what your temperature is.
It's bad.
Worse than I thought.
Look.
Haven't you got any medicine for him?
Nothing that'll help.
The doctor told me this might happen, and if it did,
I was to get Jerry to the hospital as fast as I could.
It's his appendix.
Mommy, it hurts.
I know, darling.
We'll get it fixed soon.
He can't stay here.
I've got to get him to town.
It might rupture if I don't, and you know what that means.
Yeah, but you said you couldn't get your car started.
I could take him across the road to Mr. Brooks.
His car is okay.
He'll take us in.
And the minute he gets you to the hospital, he'll call the prison.
No, he won't.
I won't tell him anything about you being here.
You expect me to believe that?
You've got to.
You've got to.
Here.
Take him, and make it quick, before I change my mind.
Oh!
Honey, wait.
But don't forget, lady, you're leaving your husband and your little girl here.
You turn me in, they'll get hurt.
You can trust me!
Trust her!
You can.
She'll keep her word.
What's a promise, made to a guy like me?
She knows you two are safe!
I don't want to hurt anybody!
I just want to be free!
He's gone, he's gone!
Yes.
He's gone.
300 men are hunting you, Sherbondy-- prison guards, city and state police,
National Guardsmen, citizen volunteers, combing the frozen highlands for you.
This is your freedom,
Sherbondy.
The sound of a car, and you're a hunted animal, diving for cover, always ready to flee or to fight.
Hold it!
Get out of there!
Hold it there,
I can use this car!
Bauer.
I got her started.
I thought
I'd catch up with you.
What's the idea?
You said you wanted to get to Pueblo.
I knew you'd never make it on foot.
My boy might have died.
You let him live.
This is the least
I could do.
Come on, get in.
Why did you bring the kid?
I had no place to leave her.
Besides, she wanted to come.
I like you, and you forgot to say good-bye.
Remember, Bauer, you're not doing this because you want to, but because I'm making you.
I mean that.
I've got my gun on you, see, all the time.
Yeah, I know.
Look.
What do we do now?
What can we do?
Good-bye, kid.
Will they hurt you?
Naw.
They'll treat me like
I've never been away.
Oh, no, don't!
No, don't!
No.
You'll see him again.
You'll see him again.
No!
Don't cry, dear.
It is 61 hours after the break.
All 12 have been crossed out, checked off, accounted for.
The reign of terror is over.
Two of the 12 lie in the prison morgue.
The other ten are here, back in solitary, back in the Siberia of Colorado State Prison.
They will be here for a long time.
Meanwhile, in the warden's home...
Here in the home of Warden Roy Best, in Cañon City, Colorado, are two brave women who distinguished themselves on a night which will be long remembered by the people of this community.
Acting on behalf of Governor Lee Knaus of Colorado,
Warden Best is presenting these ladies with "The Denver Post"
Gold Medal Award for Heroism.
Warden Best.
Mrs. Higgins,
Mrs. Oliver...
Are you nervous?
I'm shaking like a leaf.
So am I.
You didn't tell me this would be heard on the radio.
Well, I knew if I did, you wouldn't show up.
We men like to think that we have all the physical courage, but on the night of the break, you girls certainly stole the show.
These gold medals, awarded by
"The Denver Post," testify that the State of Colorado is proud of you.
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, warden.
And Mrs. Oliver, if I just had you patrolling the yard with that hammer, my troubles would be over.
Warden, may I speak to you a moment?
Certainly,
Mrs. Bauer.
Have a chair.
Will you tell me what you've done with James Sherbondy?
All ten of those men are in solitary confinement.
That's pretty bad, isn't it?
Well, they're pretty bad boys.
Will you keep Sherbondy in that long?
That, I can't answer.
When he let me take my boy to the hospital, he knew it meant recapture.
My little girl and I have prayed for him ever since.
Remember the ten lepers who were cleansed by Our Savior?
One returned to give glory to God.
Please do what you can for him.
Is there hope?
Yes, even here in prison, there's always hope.
But the way back for the violent and the savage, whether they be men or groups or nations, can only be by the road of right and law and justice.

Very well. But remember, these are secret matters.
I have a ring... from Rome, given me by Señor Incubo himself.
10,000 spells.
I repeat. 10,000 separate spells went into the making of it.
I expect a queen to buy it for a tub of gold.
It's worth no less.
Could you lend it to me for just a little while, señor?
I couldn't part with it.
The ring is priceless.
Oh, go on. Go on.
Have it your own way.
It's known as the Rose of Delight.
Put it on your finger.
No, wait.
Let me slip it on your thumb.
In a minute you'll feel the heat of it.
Such is the power it holds.
Meat.
Now that is what I call magic.
Oh, it's wonderful, señor.
I can feel the heat already.
- Good. I'll let you see it again sometime.
- Oh, please, señor.
If you let me keep it,
I'll mend for you, I'll wash for you.
I'll save you the choicest bits of the pot.
Woman, you're a robber.
I told you the ring is priceless.
Washing and mending, eh?
All right. Have it your way.
A kind heart was always my undoing.
Keep the ring, but guard it preciously.
If you lose it, the seven curses of Incubo will shrivel you up like an onion.
More meat.
Oh. Thank you, Botello.
Thank you.
I will guard the ring.
I'll guard it with my life.
Hey, Catana!
Give us a zarabanda!
- Zarabanda!
- Oh, to the devil with you!
I've been working and slogging all day.
- You think I'm going to kick up my heels all night to amuse you?
- Oh, come on!
Oh, come on.
Give us a little fun.
It takes two to do the zarabanda.
- Who's dancing against me?
- At your service, señ—
Do you have to invite someone to dance when I'm around?
Zarabanda!
Music, hombres.
What's wrong, bonita?
I'm not a ghost.
You took me by surprise, señor.
I hadn't seen you.
- Take the ring back.
- Oh, no, no.
- Take it back!
- No. Keep it till tomorrow. It worked, didn't it?
I never want to see it again.
I hate it!
Catana.
No. Please, no, señor.
You're beautiful, Catana.
- I didn't realize you were so beautiful.
- Oh, no.
No. Please.
It came to me tonight that I love you.
- It's like a fever.
- Oh, please, señor.
You don't know what you're saying.
You don't love me.
It was the ring.
The ring? What ring?
The ring that Botello gave me.
I wanted to make you love me... but now I know it isn't love.
It's the spell of magic.
- What sort of nonsense is this?
- It's true, señor.
I couldn't wait for you to come to me of your own accord.
I had to put a spell on you.
But I did come to you of my own accord.
Will you marry me, Catana?
What did you say, my lord?
Father Bartolomé is waiting.
- He will marry us tonight.
- Oh, you're mad, señor.
Noblemen don't marry camp giris.
How could you return to Spain?
- Sir, there's a village in that valley just over the ridge.
- With ample water?
- Yes, sir.
- Any signs of hostility?
No, but there's another delegation of ambassadors from the Emperor Moctezuma.
We'll take no chances. If there's an attack,
I want the advantage of higher ground.
Captain Sandoval.
- Go to the rear and speed up the column.
- Yes, sir.
- Doña Marina.
- Yes, milord?
There's a village in the next valley.
Do you know what tribe lives there?
Yes, milord.
They are the Totonacos.
- Are they friendly?
- Well, sometimes they are, sometimes they are not.
By heavens, Captain.
A king's ransom!
Yes. The closer we come to the mines, gentlemen, the bigger the nuggets.
These jewels and treasures will go to His Majesty, Don Carlos.
- They'll secure the recognition we need for our colony.
- But, sir—
The price comes high, gentlemen, but it's worth it...
to get the governor of Cuba
off our tail.
In other words, a bribe from the Emperor
Moctezuma, ruler of this heathen land... to bribe His Catholic Majesty, ruler of Christian Spain.
By my soul, Father, that's neatly put.
Is gold the only thought of this enterprise?
Is it the ducat or the cross we bear upon our banner?
I leave such theological matters to you, Father... while I proceed with His Majesty's business— and my own.
My dear, this seems to have been made just to fit your beautiful neck.
Thank you, milord.
- Doña Marina.
- Yes, milord?
Say to the ambassadors that I am gratified by this further evidence of goodwill... and look forward eagerly to visiting their emperor soon— in person.
Yes, milord.
Milord, the ambassador says...
Emperor Moctezuma knows you and your men tired after long journey... and warns any further advance, big danger.
He says you must turn back.
Leave this country now.
Tell the ambassador that Castilians are never tired... and that we're well able to meet and dispose of any dangers that lie ahead of us.
Yes, milord.
- You. Pedro de Vargas.
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me. Captain Alvarado.
- Yes, sir.
Have this treasure moved to the temple we're using as a guardhouse.
Yes, sir.
De Vargas, I promised you an opportunity to win promotion.
- I'm now giving you that opportunity.
- Thank you, sir.
- He's crazy!
- He's not only drunk, he's crazy!
- Stop him!
- Take aim, Sanchez.
Blast you, Garcia,
I'll not have my men murdered by a maniac.
One, two, three!
Oh, put down that knife, you fool.
Don't make me have to kill you.
- Slobbering over the torture of women and children.
- Four, five... six, seven—
- Burn my mother at the stake, will ya?
- Eight!
- Come on, you fiends!
- Nine!You fool!You can't stop a steel bolt.
- Ready, Sanchez?
- Yes, sir.
- Ten!
- Don't do it.
- Vargas!
- Vargas!
Juan.
Juan, don't you know me?
It's Pedro, your friend.
Look to yourself, dog.
You're not de Silva.
Why, you're—
I knew I could count on you, lad.
These dogs.
They'll not burn my mother.
I'll kill her with my own hands first.
These are your friends, Juan.
Your friends.
Friends?
Phew!Holy saints, that was close!
I'm grateful to you, de Vargas.
Would've been a shame to kill him, but what could I do? He was bent on murder.
- Douse him with a pail of water.
- No, sir.
It would be better to let him sleep it off.
A word, señores. You've all known Juan Garcia as a sober man and a good friend.
Will you do him and me the favor to keep this to yourselves?
It would be a poor thing if we couldn't do that for old Bull.
And, gentlemen, not a word about me in this either.
- I left my post to come here.
- Well, you get back there quickly.
And I'll cut the ears off of anybody who talks.
- Thank you, sir.
- I'll stay here with him, señor.
Good. Put a bucket of water beside him.
He'll be on fire when he wakes up.
Yes, sir.
You, Jose, go get him a bucket of water.
- All quiet?
- Not a sound.
Gracias.
Since when have you taken the liberty
of opening those chests?
Be good enough to hand over those gems.
- I don't have them, sir.
- Where are they?
I don't know, sir.
They're gone.
I went out of my way to give you an opportunity for advancement, de Vargas.
I, uh—
I had just discovered that the lock was broken, sir.
The fact is, I left my post and had just returned—
You, the son of Francisco de Vargas, disobeyed orders, deserted your post?
Juan Garcia was ill, sir.
They sent for me.
So a soldier in charge of an important post walks off at his pleasure... to hold the hand of a sick friend.
Very charitable.
We'll deal with that in its place.
What were your two guards doing?
Were they off for a stroll too?
Or are you suggesting they rifled the chest?
- No, sir. I locked the door myself when I went out.
- Heaven give me patience.
Do you expect me to believe someone walked through solid masonry into this room?
Now hand over those gems.
Don't force me to have you stripped.
- Whoever took the gems, sir, came through that door in the wall.
- What door? I see no door!
One moment, sir.
By your leave.
When I came back it was ajar.
By my faith, de Vargas,
I misjudged you.
You're even a poor liar.
I'm not lying, sir.
On my honor, there's a door here somewhere.
Don't speak to me of honor.
Consider yourself under arrest. Guard!
Look, sir!
Bless my soul.
Hmm.
And I had a door built.
- Where's the lock to this chest?
- Right here.
That's odd.
This has been filed.
The Indians have no steel.
It must have been one of our own men.
I should hate to see you hang, de Vargas... but I have no doubt that will be the decision of my captains, unless these gems are recovered.
I'll give you until this hour tomorrow to recover them.
You're relieved of your duty.
Yes, sir.
Guard. Call additional men
to move these chests to my quarters.
Sí, señor.
Oh. Oh.
Oh, my head. Oh!Oh!
Oh, my poor head.
Oh.
- Botello. What happened?
- What misery.
- I'm lucky to even be alive. Oh, my poor head.
- But what happened?
- You won't tell on me, Pedro, lad?
- Of course not.
I was just taking a stroll with one of the Indian ladies.
Ugly as sin, of course.
Color of mud.
But charming, dear boy.
Charming.
You know the penalty for touching an Indian.
Now, now, Pedro. You know orders don't apply to a cockroach like me.
- Did she hit you?
- Oh, no. We—We were just out here, under the trees... when suddenly two men—
I could swear they were Castilians— came right through the wall of the temple— and not a door in sight.
- Just ran right out and hit me.
- Two men. Who were they?
I was paying no attention.
Trying to save her soul I was, may the saints credit it to me.
- Well, did you see which way the men went?
- Yes. That way.
The devil's curse on them.
Oh, my poor head.
- The road to Villa Rica and the coast.
- And welcome they are to it.
You won't tell on me, Pedro, lad?
No, not a word.
- Not a word out of you either.
- No.
- Can you make it home all right?
- I think so.
And the upshot of it is that we sail at dawn.
 We could stand more water
and supplies. It's a long stretch to Cuba.
Believe me, gentlemen.
A lame goat takes no siesta.
If something's to be done, do it.
- Right. Then we sail with the dawn wind.
- Now listen, men.
You all know that everyone who follows Cortez... is going to be in great trouble with the governor of Cuba.
Especially when he finds out that Cortez is... planning to cheat him out of his share of the treasure...
turn it all over to His Majesty,
the ruler of Spain.
Our only chance
is to get back to Cuba now... tell the governor what's going on here... let him see we're his friends... and get our reward.
Corio, this is the wisest decision you've ever made.
- You've got the gems with you.
- Unfortunately, no.
No? What about the secret door to the temple?
Pedro de Vargas was on guard, and we couldn't get him away from his post.
 We even got his friend
Juan Garcia drunk and sent for him...
- but he—he wouldn't budge.
- We didn't want to risk the whole
project for a few trinkets.
What difference does it make anyway, as long as we get the whole cargo in the end?
Just this: The governor of Cuba will get it, not us.
Don't worry about your share, Corio.
I'll see that every man
on this ship gets a double share.
Ho! What are you doing there?
Who is this man?
I caught him eavesdropping!
Pedro de Vargas.
Let me have the handling of him!
Before you let these men kill me, ask them to tell you... what they did with the gems they took from the treasure chest tonight.
- Stand aside.
- Hold your tongue!
- What did you say, de Vargas?
- Trust one of Cortez's spies to lie.
Wait a minute!
What makes you say they got the gems?
Because they did get me to leave my post.
Because the gems were taken while I was gone.
And because the secret door was left partly open.
By my soul.
And you talk about liars.
We'll have every stitch off of them!
Curse you for a hothead, Corio.
Didn't you ever hear of a joke?
Cermeno and I were only jesting.
Thought we'd surprise you later, before we arrived in Cuba.
Sure enough. The gems.
- You were right, de Vargas.
- Thank you, sir.
What are you going to do with them?
I'm placing the gems in this chest.
Everybody bear witness to that.
Look, gentlemen.
I now throw the key into the water.
The character of the sea is above suspicion.
Chain him.
De Vargas.
- De Vargas.
- What do you want?
It's me.
How much would it be worth to Cortez if this ship does not sail for Cuba?
A thousand ducats for you.
The gems in that chest are worth 50 times that.
- There's no market in Cuba for jewels like those.
- Huh?
Who would you sell them to?
Escudero's the man who'd get rich.
He already has the ear of the governor.
Even as a friend, he's proven how much you can depend on him.
I'm not in this for my health.
I'm tired of songs and promises.
What security have I that Cortez will pay?
- You've heard of my father?
- Yes.
I swear on his honor that I'll show you the way to Cortez's favor.
Agreed.
I'll get the chains off you.
If we can delay the sailing by an hour, we'll have them.
Good.
Here.
- We'll take the gems with us.
- There's no time for us to break open the safe.
We won't have to.
I threw away the wrong key.
¡Vaya! Lucky mistake.
Wasn't it?
Here. You keep them.
They're pretty, but useless to a poor man.
That was a good point of yours— no market.
- You get in the boat.
- Right.
Alarm! Alarm!
It's de Vargas!
He's escaped!
De Vargas has escaped!
 Chepito, Tobal,
fetch your crossbows. Look alive!
Don't miss. Don't miss.
Hurry, Father. Hurry.
God forgive me.
It's my own fault.
It's a wonder I don't take my cursed life.
We'll discuss that later.
How is he?
I'm glad you got here, Your Mercy.
I'm afraid the good youth is beyond human skill.
He's bleeding to death.
What a pity to see him drain out like a stuck pig.
Then hitch up your britches, man, and stop the bleeding. You should have done that at once!
He's weak from the labors of the night.
Now, hold me excused, Your Mercy, if he dies of shock.
Hold you excused?
If he dies, you'll have me to reckon with.
You mean he's going to die?
I'll do the best I can for him, but it's a poor chance. Heaven pity him.
Well, heaven pity you if anything happens to him.
Strip off his shirt.
He'll be cooler for it.
Probably won't need it again anyway.
Rip it down the front. It'll be easier to get off.
No, don't tear it. Put it aside.
I'll roll you dice for it after.
You pig!You'd cast lots
on a dying man's belly for his shroud!
Hey, not so fast.
We haven't finished with you yet.
What are you gonna do?
Why are you gonna burn me?
Have mercy.
Where's Juan? Juan.
I'm here, lad. Lie back. Easy. Don't you understand, boy? It's this or bleed to death.
Hold him. He's gotta be perfectly quiet.
Get hold of his legs.
- Sit on his middle.
- Help me, someone. Someone help me.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
He's rambling. It's a bad sign.
Your Mercy, get hold of his throat.
Hold his head still.
Otherwise he'll jerk.
Be careful, Botello.
If you miss, I'll cut your heart out.
Look at him.
Look at him.
Well, it's as I feared, but you wouldn't be warned.
Even my skill can't defeat the will of God.
But I've stopped the bleeding.
You'll have to admit it's a well-seared wound.
No. He's breathing.
It's true. His heart still beats.
Well, why not? In the practice of true science, God often lends a hand.
You may think that anyone can lay a hot iron on an open wound.
Far from it. It has to be timed to the very split of a second.
Had I removed the iron too soon, the wound would not have seared.
Had I applied it just a moment longer... the patient would most certainly have died.
Be quiet and hand me that liquor.
This native dose
would raise the dead.
He'll be all right now, unless he should die of weakness, which is in God's hands.
- How is he?
- Asleep, sir.
- No. No, I'm not.
- Stay where you are.
You. Tell me one thing. How much pulque did you drink the other night?
- Uh, two gallons, Captain, on my honor.
- Liar.
Well, maybe it was three, judging from the weight of my head.
De Vargas...
Corio told me what happened on the ship.
Is it true you promised
I'd pay him 500 ducats?
No, sir. I told him that you'd give him a thousand.
Hmm.
Very well. I accept the debt.
But he'll have to wait like the rest of us...
- till the end of our venture.
- Thank you, sir.
Oh. About your leaving camp contrary to orders.
I'll be frank with you.
If you'd failed, I'd have hanged you.
But since you succeeded, I herewith promote you to the rank of captain.
Me? Captain?
I daresay your father will be glad when he hears of this.
Yes, sir.
You made a lucky stroke,
Captain de Vargas.
Those men on the Gallega were attempting to escape to Cuba... to get the aid of
Governor Velázquez.
Had they succeeded, they would have defeated this expedition... destroyed everything we fought for.
Where there's one traitor, there are apt to be two.
And we face a repetition of that same danger as long as we have ships waiting for us.
But, sir, those ships are our only means of communication and— and retreat.
If one can't retreat, he must go forward.
If we survive this expedition, gentlemen... the order I have given to destroy this armada... will go down in history as a monument to our resolution and courage.
If we fail, it doesn't matter, as history will forget us.
Sir, this is not an attack.
It's a peaceful mission.
- How do you know, de Vargas? Maybe it's a trick.
- No. It's another ambassador.
Why waste words on these unpredictable savages?
We'll hear what they have to say and see what they've brought to offer.
All right.
Hold your fire.
But watch me.
If these devils make one false move, we'll cut 'em down to the last man.
- Get Doña Marina.
- Yes, sir.
Never mind. Here she is.
Once more we have need of your precious voice.
Yes, milord.
Doña Marina, find out who honors us in this royal manner.
Yes, milord.
Who is this? Moctezuma?
No, milord.
It is Cacamatzin... nephew and first councillor of the great emperor Moctezuma.
Indeed! Well!
Say to the royal ambassador that I am pleased to welcome him to my camp.
Will you come, my lord?
Milord, the Emperor Moctezuma send these gifts... and ask how long you propose to favor his country with your presence.
Tell the royal prince that depends upon... the Emperor Moctezuma's hospitality and wisdom.
Yes, milord.
Milord, the royal prince says his gods are all-powerful.
They threaten to bring drought, pestilence and war if you remain.
- Captain Alvarado.
- Yes, sir.
Train your cannon on that heathen idol and fire when ready.
- Yes, sir.
- Tell the royal prince to watch closely... and see which is the more powerful, his gods or my cannon.
- Ready!
Fire!
Now, Señor Cacamatzin... tell your uncle, the emperor, how helpless your gods are before us.
Father, I count my chances in purgatory improved by this temple cleaning.
When the time comes for idols to fall, they fall of themselves.
Get a detail of men. Take charge of the treasure.
- Yes, sir.
- Milord... the royal prince says now your only hope of escape... is to turn back and leave this country at once.
Leave the country?
Impossible. We have no ships.
He says 18 ships have just arrived at Villa Rica.
Eighteen ships at Villa Rica?
- That means a thousand men.
- Cannon and horses.
Thank the royal prince for this very welcome news.
Our supplies and reinforcements have arrived sooner than expected.
- Yes, milord.
- Now, by heaven, we've got them where we want 'em.
Don't be a fool.
Those ships come from Cuba, not Spain.
Governor Velázquez is not a man to sit idly by while there's gold to be had.
He's come to hang us from a yardarm.
This royal prince knows more than he's telling. We must act at once.
Divide our force, leave half here, march with the rest to Villa Rica.
- Villa Rica?
- It's a hard choice, but it's one thing or the other.
Stay here and we're caught between
Governor Velázquez on one side... and a million savages on the other.
- Doña Marina.
- Yes, milord.
Inform the royal prince it will be necessary for five of his chieftains to remain here...
- as a guarantee that there will be no violence while I am gone.
- Yes, milord.
- Captain Sandoval.
- Yes, sir.
- Prepare to march immediately.
- Yes, sir.
- De Vargas.
- Yes, sir.
You will be captain of the guard.
Prepare quarters for the prisoners.
- See they do not leave this camp.
- Yes, sir.
- Doña Marina.
- Yes, milord.
Tell Señor Cacamatzin that we take our leave in all respect and friendship.
Yes, milord.
All quiet?
All quiet.
Too quiet, if you ask me.
Regular hurricane weather.
Makes you feel like something was hanging over us.
Listen.
There it goes again.
They're a pretty big pack if they rise.
There's still enough of us to handle them.
I wonder.
Why don't you get some rest, amigo?
You've been in your boots a straight 30 hours.
I want to have a look around first.
Hasta la vista.
Hasta la vista.
- Señor.
- Yes?
Will you speak to me, Señor Pedro?
Señor, I know you, but you not know me.
Me Coatl.
Coatl! Why didn't you speak to me?
Señor Pedro Castilian.
I hate Castilians.
But you and I are friends, Coatl.
I think of that, señor.
I think of what you do for me in Spain.
I think I speak to you now... maybe I understand better why you come here.
This is my country, señor.
These my people, my gods.
We not come tell you to stop loving your gods. We not come make you slaves.
Why you do this, señor?
Well, I'm afraid I haven't any answer for that.
It isn't right for men to worship idols.
There's only one true God.
Maybe your god and my god same god.
Maybe we just call them by different names.
Perhaps. But we're not enemies, you and I.
I give my life for you, señor... but you hurt my people, I fight you.
I can understand that.
I suppose that... if I were in your place, I'd do the same.
Be still.
I've got to get around this ear.
Careful now.
Remember, I'm ticklish.
By my soul, I'd rather clip a horse.
You've been singin' all morning. Why?
- I feel like singing.
- Why?
What a picture.
It's a good thing I'm not jealous.
Don't rattle her, Brother Pedro.
This is a critical moment.
And if she cuts me—
Señor, you must get some rest.
Oh, those drums.
If only they'd stop.
They'll never stop.
Here's a wench for the New World, Brother Pedro.
Bless me if I know which of you I love best.
Catana, if he ever breaks your heart and goes chasing after some fancy lady, I'll—
You'll what?
I don't know. I guess it would break my heart too.
My poor señor.
Four days without sleep.
Go to sleep, my señor.
Go to sleep.
Oh, my señor, I love you.
I love you so much it hurts.
Juan.
Does he still love her a great deal?
- Who?
- The Lady Luisa.
No, tell me truly.
I want the truth.
I don't know.
Perhaps as a cavalier loves his lady.
He took a pledge to serve her, whatever that means.
I wouldn't understand.
But I understand.
Let him love her if he wants to.
But I shall bear him his first son.
Catana!
That's what I'm so happy about.
Does he know?
No, not yet.
It's a secret.
But isn't it wonderful?
Yes.
I've been very wicked all my life, Juan.
It's hard for a girl without parents to be good.
Maybe that's why our Lord has not held it against me— has been so kind.
You don't think he'd take it out on my baby, do you?
- Take what out?
- My sins.
Oh, Catana.
My baby is innocent.
Besides, he will be the son of Pedro de Vargas... and the grandson of Don Francisco de Vargas.
To think that
I shall be his mother—
I, Catana Perez, of the Rosario.
We'll name him Francisco.
No, of course not.
I forgot.
His father would not want to give his name to... my son.
But I'll bring him up properly.
He'll be smart too.
Perhaps he'll be a priest, maybe a bishop.
Why not?
Think of it.
My son a bishop.
Oh, my darling...
I want him to have everything
I never had.
But all I can give him is my love for you.
Oh, señor, señor.
I love you, I love you, I love you.
It's Cortez back from Villa Rica!
Wake up, Pedro!
- Don't wake him up!
- The whole army's with him.
Must be more than 100 horses.
- Quick, Pedro, get up, get up!
- You can't wake him up.
He's captain of the guard.
He's gotta go out to meet Cortez.
Quick, your sword, Pedro.
- Captain de Vargas.
- Yes, sir.
- My congratulations, sir.
- Now the governor of Cuba will have ample evidence... of what my intentions are and be convinced that I'm the leader of this expedition.
Come with me. I want to see all my captains in my quarters immediately!
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.
God!
By my soul, Botello!
- Where did you get that hat?
- Pretty, isn't it?
Oh— How did it go?
Well, I'll tell you.
The credit in history will go to Cortez... but I shiver to think what would have happened... had I not been there to guide him by the stars.
There we were, facing an army of Cubans and Basques.
Every man with the lust of gold in his heart.
Juan, what's the matter? Are you sick?
Let loose of me, you dog!
Let loose of me!
Captain Cortez!
Captain Cortez!
Mother of God!
Why do you stop me?
But for you this dog would have been splattered against that house!
- Pedro.
- What is it, Father?
Pedro, may God give you strength in this... your hour of greatest need, to keep your vow.
Of course, Father, I intend to.
Repeat that vow, Pedro.
As you hope for salvation, repeat it now.
That you should attempt to kill
Señor de Silva, an emissary of His Majesty... by whose help the victory at Cempoala was ours.
That man—That swine put my mother on the rack... tortured her until she prayed for death.
That man is a fugitive from justice— a murderer— a matricide.
He strangled his own mother.
In the name of the Santa Hermandad,
I demand that he be placed under arrest.
Yes, I did it— killed my own mother— to keep this dog and his henchmen from burning her alive at the stake.
While she was dying she blessed me for it.
- Captain Sandoval.
- Yes, sir.
Put this man in irons and take him away.
We'll hear his case in due time.
A thousand pardons, Señor de Silva, for this regrettable incident.
The man shall pay for it, I assure you.
Put your faith in Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.
In him you will find strength.
Just a moment, Captain Cortez.
Here is another man who carries in his mind...
- a grievance against me— Pedro de Vargas ofJaén.
- Pedro de Vargas?
He's a gallant soldier.
He's won promotion in my company.
It distresses me to bother you with these personal matters... but de Vargas has already made one attempt upon my life.
I have no doubt his grievance
will be increased... when he learns that I have married the lady of his choice— the Lady Luisa de Carvajal.
 Señor de Silva has come to us
as an emissary of His Majesty...
and as my personal guest.
Under the circumstances,
Captain de Vargas...
I shall hold you personally responsible for his safety.
If any harm comes to him... the penalty will be nothing less than death... by hanging.
Come with me, Señor de Silva.
Forget your vow and God will forget you.
Señor.
Pedro.
Catana.
Moctezuma's city is no ripe plum ready to fall into our laps, gentlemen.
It will require a deal of cultivation.
But thanks to our victory at Cempoala, we'll soon be ready for the harvesting.
But of our plans, more later.
You left His Majesty well, señor?
In excellent health,
Captain Cortez... but deeply concerned for the safety and well-being of this company.
How concerned, señor?
His Majesty is convinced that the seeds of heresy are everywhere... and that they need investigation in this new land as well as in Spain.
He especially enjoined me as supremo of the Santa Hermandad, to look into the matter.
You would bring the
Santa Hermandad here?
There was a letter,
Captain Cortez— an order of arrest sent by me concerning a certain heretic in this company.
- It remains unanswered.
- I know of no such letter.
- It's possible for a letter to be lost.
- Or stolen.
However, it's of no consequence.
I myself shall hold an examination.
Have you ever attended an examination of the Santa Hermandad, Captain?
- No, I have not.
- It's a valuable experience.
I remember one examination of a supposedly honorable family ofJaén.
One would have thought
them above suspicion...
though the evil treachery of the father and son
became clear enough later.
There was, I believe, a girl of about 12, outwardly very fair and innocent looking...
but so deeply had the detested roots ofheresy
been implanted even in this child...
that she refused to bear
witness against her parents... and it was necessary to hoist her onto the strappado where she was—
Murdered.
I compliment you on a noble feat— the death of a 12-year-old child.
Who spoke of a feat, Captain?
A stroke of policy
perhaps, but—
A stroke of inhuman fiendishness.
Careful, señor.
I'm His Majesty's emissary.
Do you take refuge behind that?
Refuge?
Yes, refuge! Or have you the stomach to meet me man to man?
If not, then without picking words,
I'll ask you, who's the coward here?
And the time and place of this meeting?
- Here and now.
- You, sir! Do you forget where you are?
You dare draw your sword at my table?
But, sir, the family this man speaks of is my family.
The murdered girl was my sister.
I am not concerned with private feuds.
I thought I made it clear we'll have no brawling!
Are you a soldier, Captain de Vargas?
If not, hand me your sword.
Sir, do you realize what this man represents?
With him, the Santa Hermandad with all its evils has come to the New World.
A kingdom within a kingdom.
A despotism so strong, so powerful... that it paralyzes the human soul with terror.
Already he speaks of the strappado and tortured children.
That will do, de Vargas.
We have no need of oratory here.
This is not oratory, Captain Cortez.
That man is a fiend without honor, an assassin of infants.
Captain Cortez, may I remind you... that this man is a criminal under sentence of death in Spain.
I crossed the ocean in behalf of His Majesty's affairs... not to die at the hands of a fugitive who'd so greatly benefit by my death.
My life, valueless as it may be, is your responsibility.
A thousand pardons for this regrettable incident at my dinner table.
However, I must make one thing clear.
The charges you have made against a loyal officer of my company carry no weight here.
Those are matters for an ecclesiastical court... and the testimony of witnesses, and we have neither the one nor the other.
Father Bartolomé is in charge of the spiritual interests of this enterprise.
And as long as he vouches for Captain de Vargas,
that is enough for me.
I must ask you to accept those terms, or return to the coast.
I accept the terms.
But will Pedro de Vargas abide by them?
My word on it.
Doña Marina, will you entertain my guests?
I have some matters of state to discuss with Señor de Silva.
Yes, milord.
- Captain de Vargas.
- Yes, sir.
If it is necessary to teach
20 rebels the lesson of discipline... that lesson will be taught.
Carry that thought with you.
Who is it?
- Father, help me. Help me!
- Hup.
Father, they arrested Pedro.
Diego de Silva has been murdered.
No. No, Father.
It isn't dying that matters.
I've faced death many times.
But it's leaving you.
What's going to become of you, my beloved?
I shall die too.
No.
You must live.
You must live for our son... who hasn't yet been born.
Oh, Catana, how are you ever going to tell him that his father was hanged?
You must go back to my father and mother in Italy.
They'll take care of you.
But promise me that you'll never tell them how I died.
My father's a soldier.
If I died in battle, he'd— he'd grieve for me, yes... but he'd be proud too.
But to be hanged... and for a crime I didn't commit.
Deliver us, O mercifulJesus... from that place of darkness and torture... and receive us into thy paternal bosom, there to love—
- Padre.
- And praise and glorify.
- Padre?
- Yes, my son?
- Señor Pedro die at dawn?
- That is the verdict.
Señor Pedro not kill de Silva.
Señor Pedro my friend.
- I know who kill de Silva.
- Yes? Go on.
You Christian priest.
I tell you, you not let Señor Pedro die?
In God's name, man, speak.
In a few minutes a man is going to his death.
If you know who killed Diego de Silva, it is your duty to save Pedro now.
I kill de Silva.
Me, Coatl.
- God's will be done.
- Yes, Padre.
Guard!
They're coming.
Kiss me good-bye now.
Let me hold you close for this last minute.
Guard!Guard, unlock the prison door.
Good-bye, my love.
Only I know it isn't good-bye.
Pedro, you kept your vow
and God didn't desert you.
- You're free.
- Free? I've killed him!
- Take her away.
- No!
Let me go!
How you must have pained our Lord's heart
and that ofhis holy Mother.
It is wrong even to contemplate... the taking of a life, your own as well as another's.
God is the giver of life.
God alone can be the taker.
The sin is all the greater...
since God has placed
an unborn soul in your keeping.
But our Lord has a compassionate heart.
He has mercifully ordained that Pedro will live.
You have been blessed, my child, beyond most women in being given a second chance.
May you walk in the light of that knowledge all the days of your life.
Captain de Vargas reporting, sir.
Sandoval reporting, sir.
Everything ready to move as planned, sir.
Gentlemen, this time last year we were fighting mosquitoes in swamps... accepting paltry gifts and half starving.
But now, we stand knocking at the very door of the great emperor Moctezuma.
We shall meet His Majesty face to face, have done with ambassadors and specks of gold.
This, gentlemen, is just the beginning.
De Vargas, order the first detachment ready to move forward.
- Yes, sir.
- Gentlemen, be ready to march.
Yes, sir.
I charge you, put this greed for gold out of your hearts.
Open your eyes
to what lies before you.
Go forward not as conquerors,
but as men of God!
The sun shines here as fair as in Spain.
Let it shine on all men alike.
Here there shall be neither master nor slave... no looking up nor looking down...
but here all men shall be equal,
according to God's plan.
The Lord has indeed blessed this land.
In its richness it may yet outvalue all the gold of Moctezuma.
And in God's own time... it will blossom forth under the cross of Christianity... a haven for the weak, a refuge for the strong...
with all the good of the Old World
and none of its ills.
Before this venture is concluded, gentlemen...
we will taste thejoys of victory...
or the bitterness of defeat.
Many will die in the days
that lie ahead...
but those who survive will one day
return to their homeland...
rich in wisdom and gold,
exonerated by His Majesty...
and forever secure
in the knowledge...
that they have participated
in the opening of a new world.
There ain't nothin' steady about a woman, Stokes.
Their minds is as changeable as the moon.
Yeah. And there's always a man in it.
Man in the moon,Juke, get it?
No. My Pearl ain't like that.
You and Pearl figure on holy matrimony?
She don't like my whiskers. Then why don't you whack them off?
Oh, Pearl wants me to, but I keep thinkin' about Samson.
You mean Samson, the little tailor in Albuquerque?
No, you heathen.
Samson was a king.
Lived in Egypt or " Afrikee" or someplace like that. Well, what about him?
Well, he had a mane and whiskers just like mine.
Strongest fella you ever seen.
Pushed buildings over with his bare hands. Yes, sir.
He had a gal, too, named Delilah.
Didn't she like whiskers either?
No, sir.
Snuck in one night, clipped Samson slicker than a frog's belly.
After that he was so durn weak, couldn't even break a toothpick.
You're an awfully sweet little girl,
Miss Myrtle, and it won't be long before you meet your daddy in Albuquerque.
Oh, Mr. Cole, you're so funny.
Isn't he, Miss Wallace?
Yes, honey, very amusing,
Amusing? He's funny.
Isn't he, Mr. Martin?
Very funny. Yes, sir, he's a regular circus. Certainly is.
Thank you, ma'am, ladies.
I aim to please.
You know, Miss Myrtle, if I was gonna see the man I love most,
I'd try to get some sleep so's to look fresh and pretty when he meets me.
My daddy don't care how I look, just so I get there.
Shouldn't wonder, ma'am, if the same advice wouldn't work for you too.
You haven't closed your eyes since we left the railroad. I'm fine, thank you.
Whoa!
All right, come out a-jumpin' and reach for nothin' but sky. Everybody but the kid.
Throw your guns overboard and come down out of there.
We ain't got no gun and we ain't got no box. Get down!
All right, everybody, line up!
And don't anybody try anything!
Come on, get over there!
Well, missy, what have you got there? Nothing.
I'll have a look at that satchel.
No!
Boy, I got the tiger by the tail!
A tiger by the tail!
Fine way to make a livin', robbin' women. Shut up!
You're next. That's not my money. It's collections.
It belongs to-
Shut up!
Whoa, horses! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Come on, boy!
Come on, Mr. Cole! Come on!
Whoa, horses! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Myrtle?
Oh, Mr. Cole, you were elegant!
I bet this old coach had a mighty scared little passenger.
I was at first, but I ain't now.
All right, you get back inside and we'll pick up Miss Celia and the others.
No, sir.
I wanna ride up there with you.
All right, up we go.
Here comes the stage!
Where you goin',Juke?
Where's the Sheriff?
We've been robbed! Sheriff!
Help you down?
Myrtle! Honey!
Daddy!
Look here, let me through here.
Celia. Oh, you're good. Oh, Ted.
Let me look at you.
How's my kid sister?
Ted. Dear, what's the matter?
Did you hear what the driver said?
We were held up.
Did they get the money?
Our $10,000, Ted. All of it.
Ten thousand dollars?
Mr. Cole?
What is it, honey?
I told Daddy how you knocked a bandit down... and caught the runaway and saved my life.
I'm mighty obliged to you, mister.
If you ever need a friend in Albuquerque, you got one. Thanks. I'll remember that.
Durn funny, Sheriff. First stage holdup in months. Why'd they pick on my run?
I wasn't carryin' nothin', not even a gun rider.
Why'd they kill that poor fella in there?
Keep quiet,Juke. Now who were the passengers in this coach?
Well, I was drivin'. There was that lady and this fella here, the little gal and that big fella over there and the dead man.
All right, the rest of you scatter.
Go on! Go on about your business!
You look intelligent, mister. I'm the sheriff, and I'd like to know what happened out there.
Five men held up the stage, a man was killed and this lady here lost $10,000.
What's she carryin' that kind of money around for?
I wouldn't think that concerned you or me. If I were wearing that badge, I'd get a posse and go after them.
I didn't ask you how to run my office.
And if you want to stay in this town, you'd better let me run it.
Hank! Get a couple of men, take care of this body.
And round up my deputies and have them meet me here.
Remember what I said about needin' a friend.
Good-bye, Mr. Cole.
Good-bye, Myrtle.
I'm sorry about all that money.
Thank you.
Mr. Cole, I want you to meet my brother, Ted Wallace. Mr. Wallace.
We've all got a lot to be grateful to you for, Mr. Cole.
Your sister has the name wrong. It's
Cole Armin. I'm here to work for my uncle.
John Armin?
Yeah. That's right.
What's the matter with those folks?
You'd think I had smallpox.
Son, I'd rather have smallpox than the name of Armin in this town.
Go on, keep talking.
All right, Mr. Armin, here it is.
There's a crowd of men gathering at the jail right now, yelling their heads off, demanding action.
That coach brought a dead body in.
That's murder!
All right. I ordered Matt Wayne to get that Wallace girl's $10,000.
If carrying out that order involved a killing, that was part of his job.
Well, I could cover up the robbery, but killing, that's something else.
Take the outraged citizens on a horseback tour, Linton.
And, Murkil.
Murkil. Murkil!
Get Wayne and his men out of town.
You got it?
Got it.
I'm tellin' you the boss is busy and don't want to be disturbed. Now go on and sit down.
I'm telling you again
I want to see him.
What's all the racket? Ah, this office boy says I can't seeJohn Armin.
You're lookin' at him.
Why, you're notJohn Armin by 30 years.
Have you ever seen him?
Yeah, a long time ago.
How do you know I ain't him?
By the size of your ears.
That's gonna get you thrown out on yours. Murkil!
Who are you?
I came to seeJohn Armin.
I'm John Armin.
What do you want?
I'm here to take that job you offered me. What's your name?
I was wonderin' when somebody'd get around to that. I'm Cole Armin.
Welcome, Cole.
Welcome to Albuquerque.
Get going, Murkil.
This is Ed Linton, our sheriff.
Yes. I met him down at the jail. I thought you were gettin' up a posse, Sheriff.
I gave you some good advice down there.
If you're smart, you'll take it.
That's why he's here, Cole. Wants to borrow some of my men to go with him.
You know, in Texas, if the law don't move fast enough, a rope and a tree is the payoff for robbin' women and cold-blooded shootin'.
I'd be glad to go along, Sheriff. Now you stay here, Cole. We've got some talking to do.
Get what men you need from the yard,
Linton. Better get going.
Come on in, nephew.
We've got to have a little talk.
Just sit down and make yourself comfortable. Thanks.
Quite a place you got here.
Uh-huh. Well, how do you think you're gonna like your new job?
I can answer that when
I find out what the job is.
Well, I wouldn't send to Texas for a mule skinner, Cole.
You're stepping in to a manager's job.
Manager?
Yeah. Help yourself.
I've got a big enterprise here.
A transportation outfit that hauls most of the ore down from the mines.
I've done the spade work... and the money's rolling in- big money- but I'm getting tired.
You aim to let me run all that?
Soon as you learn the ropes.
Now the teamster is the toughest man alive, respects nobody he can lick.
And that covers a lot of territory.
It takes plenty of brains and brawn to handle them. Sounds interesting,
And we have to fight for contracts too.
That's where everything goes, no holds barred. Why did you pick me?
Because you're an Armin.
Oh.
And with another Armin in the saddle,
I can see my empire spreading beyond the borders of the Territory of New Mexico.
When do I start?
You've already started.
But you'll wanna clean up a little, I guess. Uh-huh.
Get a room in my hotel, then come back here.
Thanks. Thanks, UncleJohn.
I'll try to measure up to all that.
Now I want you to hit the Rio Grande bottoms south of town.
Spread out and comb the timber, Harry.
All right, Sheriff.
Here we go, men.
¶¶
¶¶
Hi, old-timer.
Hi.
I didn't know you were a drinking man.
Ordinarily I ain't, but right now I'm desperate.
Mr. Armin, there comes a time in life when a man just has to have a drink.
You're lookin' at a man seekin' courage, comfort and confidence.
You'll never find it in there.
I'm gonna keep on lookin'.
I've been humbled, humiliated, disgraced and discombobulated, Mr. Armin.
Cole's the name. Howdy,
Cole. Mine's Juke.
Howdy,Juke.
What's eating you?
Pearl- fairest of the fair in all Albuquerque... and the best durn barber in the territory.
Oh. Lady barber?
I called her that once. She run me down the street with a razor.
She says she's a tonsorial artist.
Kind of high-toned, huh?
High-toned? Swell-headed.
Has been ever since she shaved the governor last year.
She'd really be tough on you if she ever shaved the president.
Cole, that woman's tried to shave me every day for nine years.
Says I ain't doin' her business no good.
If everybody was like me, she'd starve to death,
Everybody plays.
On double-O.
So this is what's holdin' you up?
I told you before that the boss said for you and your men to get out of town.
All right.
Jackson, cash these in.
We're headin' north to White Spring Canyon.
Make your bets, gents. All right, everybody plays. All put down together.
Everything goes on number 12.
On number 12.
You gettin' the same idea I am?
Yeah.
Number 12.
Yahoo! I won!
I got the tiger by the tail!
Seems to me we've heard that before.
We have.
Come on, pay up.
I got the tiger by the tail!
Come on, fella, we're gonna have a talk.
Speak your piece.
I'm stayin' right where I am.
That's a nasty cut.
Kind of fresh too.
Hold it, mister.
Get back there, all of you!
You too!
This is private and personal between my friend and that scorpion there.
If living means anything to you, you got a lot of talking to do. Let go of me!
Come on, there!
Come on, let me through there!
Open up! That scorpion's gonna have a little talk with my partner... or he ain't gonna twist no more tiger's tail.
Well, it didn't take you long.
I want Miss Wallace's $10,000.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
The money your thugs took off of that girl on the stagecoach.
Oh, you know about that?
Yes.
Supposing they did? The Wallaces are our competitors, Cole.
And you'd rob a woman, kill an innocent man to destroy them?
The law of self-preservation applies to business too.
The competition has got to be strangled.
So the end justifies the means?
That's not important.
Life is cheap out here.
The money itself had no value to me... as money.
But don't you see, Cole? It would have set Wallace up as a dangerous threat to us.
I'm building a big business here that'll be yours someday.
Wallace's 10,000 got in my way, so I removed it.
Now I understand why our name is poison in Albuquerque.
You're too emotional,just like your father. That's why he died poor.
Never mind that.
I want that girl's money.
I don't stand for threats, Cole.
And if you got any ideas of calling on the law, it'll be your word against mine.
What about the word of your hired killer?
- He won't talk.
- If he don't want to shake hands with sudden death, he'll talk.
There's a mob with a rope looking for you.
You want to talk to them or to the law?
Take him to the sheriff,Juke.
Tell him I said to lock him up.
I wish Pearl was here to see what a useful citizen I've turned out to be.
Come on, get movin'.
Let's you and I have another little talk, eh, Cole?
Do you want to save any of these, Ted?
No, burn 'em all up. I don't want to save a scrap of anything to remind me of this place or anybody in it.
How do you suppose Mr. Armin knew
I was bringing the money?
He's got connections all over this territory.
And his nephew being on the same stage wasn't just a coincidence.
Just because his name is Cole Armin doesn't convict him with me.
Look... instead of using the money we have left to go home, couldn't we make a fresh start here?
What with? The only start we can make, honey, is back home, or go to work forJohn Armin.
Armin! Armin! Armin!
That's all I've heard since I got here.
Albuquerque could grow into a big city someday, and you could grow with it.
It's the fear of his power that's strangling you and everybody else in this town.
I not gonna stand by and watch you quit.
Is this the Wallace Freighting Company?
Ted! It was the Wallace Freighting Company.
You've got nothing to say that we want to hear. Get out!
Miss Celia, I don't want to fight any more today.
Will you ask your brother to sit down and listen?
Sit down, Ted.
I came here thinking you might need some help. What kind of help?
I could learn to drive mules. Is this another one of your uncle's schemes?
Well, I just came from him, but he didn't send me.
I'm interested in this town and its possibilities.
Matter of fact, I'm looking for a job.
You heard what my sister said.
We're out of business.
Maybe this will put you back in business.
Our money. How did you
- You'll find it all there.
I don't know how to thank you. I can tell you how, by selling me an interest in your company.
You mean you want to be partners with us? I reckon.
Mister, you've made a deal.
The Wallace-Armin Freighting Company.
Sheriff! Sheriff!
Jackson, I'm not going to tell you again. Stop that noise.
I ain't started makin' noise yet.
When I do, everyone will hear me, including the United States Marshal.
You can tell Armin and tell him this-
I ain't aimin' to go to no gallows alone.
Walking from here to Chicago and back doesn't do my carpet any good. Besides, it doesn't solve anything.
What am I gonna do about thatJackson?
How am I gonna keep him quiet?
So you got a prisoner who threatens to make trouble. I think we can handle that situation.
What about them lamps burning all night in the Wallace office, their stockade bustin' with mules and new equipment?
I tell you there's somethin' goin' on over there. Oh, I know all that.
What I want to know is, what do they got in the fire?
What their contacts are? What their bids are? I want a report from the inside.
How you gonna get it?
The party who's gonna attend to that is on the way here now- so stop worrying... and get off my desk!
¶ Gonna run all night ¶
¶ Gonna run all day ¶
¶ Bet my money on a bob-tailed nag ¶
¶ Somebody bet on the bay ¶¶
Hey, wait a minute!
What are you tryin' to do, scald me tender enough to pick my pin feathers?
Listen, you, you're having supper with nice folks... and you don't to want to smell like a mule, do you?
Well, I ain't aimin' to stay after vittles anyhow.
I gotta meet Pearl when she closes her Tonsorial Parlor. Yeah.
What are you lookin' at me like that for?
Juke, there's a sheriff looking for you somewhere. Where? Where?
Ah, what'd you say that for?
Nobody'd hide behind that foliage you're wearin' unless he was playing hooky from somebody's jail.
Now ain't that a nice thing to say.
Here I agree to work with you fellas, take you into my home and-
Say, how do I know how many sheriffs is chasin' you around the country?
I'm gettin' that look again.
What does it mean this time?
This time it means
I'm gonna cut your hair.
No, sir! You ain't gonna do no such a durn thing now!
Stay away from me with them sheep shears. Go on now.
Hey, who's this awful-looking character? Huh?
Character? Why, doggone it, that's me without my whiskers. Yeah.
Cole, this is gonna be a secret just twixt you and me, huh?
You fellas ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
That costs plenty of money. Oh, I don't know what you fellas are worrying about.
You got wagons, mules, men, money enough for wages and feed till you get goin'.
I guess that ought to show John Armin you mean business, eh, Cole? I reckon you're right,Juke.
But I'm just realizing how much I gotta learn about this ore-freighting business.
Ted, where is that Half-High mine you're talking about?
It's a lot easier to show you on the map. Come on.
That'll give you a better idea.
Uh-huh.
Now this is the road to the mine. Yeah.
It's the only way up.
That looks like a tough place to get to.
Oh, gettin' up ain't the problem.
It's gettin' down with 10-mule wagons.
Yep. Well, that's the only way you can make it pay,
Those big wagons with trailers on that steep and narrow road? Sure looks dangerous.
Oh, of course it's dangerous, but if Armin can do it, you can. Armin?
He's got Huggins, the owner, by the throat.
Nobody else in town would touch the haul.
So he gets his own price. Can't we underbid him and make it pay?
Enough to keep us goin', that's about all.
But if we can save money for Huggins, other owners will line up on our side.
Why, it seems like to me we ought to pay Mr. Huggins a visit.
Listen, you men, you come and eat this supper right now or I'll feed it to the mules.
Yeah, go on. Get over there.
Go on, go on. You too. You too.
You fellas ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Here Miss Celia's been slavin' over a hot stove all day... mixin' fancy vittles for you galoots.
Ah, quiet,Juke.
You talk too much.
That's his association with Damon and Pythias.
Hey, wait a minute. If that road isn't wide enough for two wagons to pass, what do you do when you meet one coming down? You don't pass anybody.
You see, there's a flag on top that's raised as a warning if somebody's comin' down.
We do the same thing at the bottom if we're goin' up.
Eat your supper, boys!
Evenin', Sheriff.
Wait a minute, Harvey.
Leave it here. I'll take it in to him. Suits me.
ThatJackson don't look none too tame to me anyway. He needs a lot of watchin'.
Yeah. Good night, Sheriff.
Good night.
Here's your supper,Jackson.
Now listen, when I leave,
I'm gonna forget to lock you in.
That door's open.
There's a horse waitin' for you.
You get aboard and out of Albuquerque, fast.
Well, you must of got my message to Armin.
When I come back in five minutes, I don't wanna find anybody here, understand?
What's the matter, Sheriff?
What happened?
You can see, can't you? This fella
Jackson broke out of jail and I shot him.
I reckon trouble's over for him, but it might just be startin' for some folks.
What do you mean by that?
Nothing. Only sometimes dead men leave ghosts behind 'em.
That's an awfully good supper,
Miss Celia. I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Uh-oh. I'm warning you now. You can't hold me responsible for any casualties.
This is my first experience in an apron.
Uh-uh!
Huh? Oh.
You're doing fine.
Uh-oh.
I think I spoke too soon.
Well, at least this is one less dish to dry. I'm sorry.
It was Ted's fault.
He said you could do anything.
Hmm. You know, that, uh, brother of yours is all right.
He's all the family I have left.
When Ted came out West and got started in this business,
I sold the home back East and joined him.
I reckon he found the goin' pretty tough.
He found your uncle running the whole town.
Riding herd on the little fella, huh? Yes.
I hope you won't be sorry you joined us against him.
There's a fella in jail I'm figurin' on takin' the jingle out of my uncle's spurs.
I'm sticking to my deal, Celia.
I thought you'd feel like that, Cole.
Cole? Cole?
Where is everybody here?
The sheriff just shotJackson makin' a getaway on a horse. What?
Yeah. I'm afraid your uncle's spurs are still jingling.
Now I agree with Ted here.
We have the equipment and drivers and can guarantee the delivery of paying loads to the mill... at a price attractive to you and profitable to us.
Experience is more important than equipment, Mr. Armin.
When a wagon train leaves our mine, we've got to know it'll get to the mill.
I can answer for that.
I drove the haul for Walton.
I know every foot and every hazard.
And now we've gotJuke with us. Yes, sir.
Ted'll be on the lead wagon. I'll be right behind him with Damon and Pythias.
Why, I could make that run with a piano on the back of every mule, pail of water in each hand and another on my head.
Mr. Clark, what about a deal?
Well, now wait a minute. Mr. Huggins, our manager, feels you're new here.
He wants me to show you what you're headin' into. Come here.
I saw it.
I rode up here, you know.
What's that mine up there?
Angel's Roost.
Angel's Roost, huh? But I wouldn't get too ambitious, Mr. Armin.
It's the richest strike in New Mexico, but the road up there is just plain murder.
Who's got that contract?
Nobody. They're afraid to try it.
Why'd you work the property if you couldn't get the ore down?
Well, Huggins had a deal with John Armin.
He agreed if we sunk a shaft he'd get the ore to the mill. What happened?
Well, we like to broke our company digging in up there.
And when we were ready to go,
Armin welshed.
Tried to hold us up on the hauling price.
I reckon he figured on breaking us then takin'it over himself.
Howdy, lady.
Welcome to Albuquerque.
Thank you.
Could you tell me whereJohn Armin's office is?
Straight down the street. Monarch
Building. You can't miss it.
Bed 'em down,Juke. I'll put the contracts in the safe. I'll tell Celia the good news.
Tell her to put the coffee pot on.
Right.
Put 'em up.
Get over here and open up this safe. There's no money in it.
Open it up!
Well!
Cole! Cole!
What happened? Where was that shot? The office.
What's the shooting, Ted?
A hold-up man jumped me when this young lady came in and started blazing away.
Where's the body?
Just went through that door.
We can't have no bodies runnin' around loose in Albuquerque.
I'm afraid I'm not a very good shot. Good or bad, it was timely.
You always carry a gun, lady?
It came in handy tonight.
Just happen to be passing by?
Yes. I only arrived in Albuquerque today.
I'm looking for work. I'm Letty Tyler.
Work? What kind of work?
Oh, bookkeeping, correspondence, payroll.
I think I could make myself generally useful.
We'll need some help, Cole. Now that we've got the Huggins's contract, we expect to get others.
We're certainly grateful to you, Miss Tyler, though I'm afraid we couldn't pay you much at first.
Well, I'm sure I could make out on whatever you could afford.
Well, what do you say, boys? It's all right with me. What do you say, Cole?
I'm just a junior partner.
Whatever the seniors decide.
Then you can start in the morning.
We'll be busy with the Half-High haul.
So, Celia, you can sort of acquaint her with things until we get back.
Fine. I was about to make some coffee.
Won't you join us? Thank you. I'd love to.
Lock up the Huggins's contract, will you, Cole? It's on the safe.
I had him opening the safe when the gal walked in.
Your idea worked out just like you said, Mr. Armin.
Well, I got the job.
Did you find out anything?
Yes. They're nice people.
I wasn't asking about their social qualities. What are they up to?
They've got a contract. The first haul comes off in the morning- the Half-High mine.
I want to congratulate the both of you on a job well done.
Sit down, Miss Tyler.
I can see now that our association is going to be quite profitable to both of us.
Looks all right,Juke.
There's no flag showing on top.
Well, that gives us the right-of-way.
What are we waitin' for?
Let's get goin'.
What are you doin' on this road, Murkil?
Hi, Wallace.
Funny place to meet up, ain't it?
You didn't raise no flag on the top. That gives us the right-of-way. Flag or no flag,
the right-of-way belongs to anybody that can take it. Put down that gun.
And the other one too.
I guess you had things figured about right, Cole.
Figured?
You didn't think your boss was the only
Armin in town that could figure, did you?
Both of you get down and unhitch those horses.
The bookkeeper's job doesn't include janitor work, Letty.
Oh, I'm just sort of clearing the decks for action.
Ted won't know the place all cleaned up.
You think they'll get that ore down safely today?
Ted and Juke are the best drivers in the territory. They'll bring it down.
Oh, I'm sure they will. I haven't seen Cole Armin today. He go along?
Oh, no. He doesn't drive.
He had some other business.
Probably lining up some new contracts, huh? Probably.
He's awfully nice, isn't he?
Seems to be.
Handsome too.
They made it, Letty!
They made it!
Hey, Murkil, helpin' Wallace bring the ore in?
That's the funniest thing I ever did see.
Did you have a nice trip, Murkil?
They oughta build a monument to you!
This town is sure proud of you,
I'll say that!
What's that for? They call this a wishing well, don't they?
Well, I'm buying a wish for a dollar.
And if I ask your wish and you tell it, then it won't come true.
That's part of the legend, too, isn't it? Reckon.
Mind if I ask you something else?
Not if you keep looking at that dollar.
Think you're gonna like Albuquerque?
Reckon.
I'm glad.
I'm glad for a lot of things that have happened to me lately. Before Albuquerque?
Keep looking at that dollar.
You know, Celia, sometimes a single face or person will change the whole way of a man's living and- and he starts wishing for things that never occurred to him before.
If your wishes and wants are real enough, they'll come in search of you.
I wish I could believe that.
Sometimes a man has to ask for what he wants.
Tell me about Texas.
Well, there's an awful lot of it and lonely sometimes.
Funny part is,
I never knew how lonely.
Keep watching that dollar.
When did you find out it was lonely?
In El Paso, when you stepped into that stagecoach.
And I found out something else too- that I needed someone to share this business of living.
Oh, why don't you ask me, Cole?
You're pretty good with that whip.
A real expert could wrap it around a man's throat at 20 feet, strangle him to death.
That could be a dangerous weapon. That's right.
I can certainly think of more pleasant things to talk about. Thank you.
Like what?
Tell me, Ted, how did Cole know... that Armin's men were going to stop you yesterday on the Half-High ride?
Oh, he didn't know. You see, Cole used to ride with the Texas Rangers.
They had a rule: whenever they expected trouble, they'd send a scout ahead before they'd expose their whole troop.
He borrowed that idea from them.
Pretty smart thinking.
Oh, he's a smart fella.
We're sure lucky we got him.
We got big plans for spreading out.
Uh, spreading out?
Well, you're practically one of the firm-
I guess there's no harm in telling you.
But if I have my way, we're going after the Angel's Roost contract.
Your way?
Well, Cole's afraid- that is, he's afraid for the animals, men and equipment.
But I'll be driving that lead wagon, and I know I can bring 'em through.
I'll be pulling for you, Ted.
Then how can I lose?
Buenos dias, amigo.
Buenos dias.
Juke, what in the world are you dressed like that for?
Aw, it's an idea of Pearl's.
She said she wouldn't go to the shindig at the mission... unless I got all rigged up like this.
I'm supposed to be a " trooby-door. "
Troubadour.
Yeah, trooby-door.
Somebody blew it up- the Half-High mine!
The Half-High mine- somebody blew it up!
Tell Pearl I couldn't wait.
Hyah! Get outta the way!
Get outta the way, folks!
Hyah! Get outta the way!
Giddyap!
Move it! Hyah!
Cole! Ted!
Welcome to the family.
That's the best news I've heard in years. Thanks.
I hope you'll be awfully happy.
Thanks. I'm sure we will be.
Cole!
Cole! Ted!
The Half-High's been blowed up!
What?
Half-High?
Mm.
What's next, Cole?
Angel's Roost.
Young fella, what you propose is impossible.
But, Mr. Huggins, your loss of the Half-High mine might put us out of business too.
That's why we're forced to tackle Angel's Roost.
Twenty ton of ore slipping and sliding in that shale on a narrow road... with only a prayer between you and a drop of 5,000 feet?
No, you'd never make it.
It's a road, isn't it?
Not one that'll hold a 20-ton load in that shale with 12 mules.
Walton tried it and lost wagons, mules and men. We still wanna try it.
Have you got that kind of equipment and drivers?
Give us a week. We'll have
'em. You can count on it.
Just a minute. It'll have to be
10 wagons. Nothing less will pay.
Ten wagons?
Yup. If you come through, there'll be a contract waiting for you at the mill.
But I still think you're crazy to try it.
Mr. Huggins, your people have extensive holdings all over this territory.
Now, if we make good on this haul, we'll expect you to give us a chance at the rest of your business.
Just have that mill ready a week from today.
It'll be ready.
Here's a warning.
Just between us, we're not satisfied that Half-High explosion was an accident.
Neither are we.
Come on, Ted.
Good luck, boys. Thank you. See you at the mine.
Yeah.
Hope we didn't bite off more than we can chew. Aw, we got plenty of time.
Is it bad, Ted?
It's my leg.
Let me through here.
What's going on? Who shot him?
The man who shot him is dead.
And you can tellJohn Armin that anyone else he sends after us can expect the same treatment.
What's John Armin gotta do with it?
You oughta know that better than any man in Albuquerque. You're working for him.
That's pretty wild talk.
That's not talk. It's a warning.
The next move
Armin makes against us, we'll wipe him out if it means killing every one of this thugs and burning his place to the ground.
Warren, help me to get him home.
I don't want any more protests from you, Miss Tyler.
Any consequences that follow your job,
I'll back you up.
But, in case you get any righteous ideas,
you're a criminal accessory to anything that happens.
Don't forget that.
Any scruples I might have had went on the bargain counter when I took this job, but you can count me out of any more murder plans.
I give the orders here.
I make the conditions.
You've got your instructions.
Carry them out.
I'm still working for you.
So, my nephew threatens to burn me out of business.
Hmm. Yes.
Is he gonna be all right,
Doctor?
You needn't expect him to be on his feet for a couple of months yet.
That bullet split the femur right through.
Mm. Split the what?
The femur- the thigh bone.
Right now, he's sufferin' from shock.
Needs rest, plenty of it.
That means no talking.
I'll look in again in the morning.
I guess that finishes us for the Angel's Roost contract.
Now, why does it? Huh. To listen to him talk, you'd think he's the only driver in New Mexico.
Yeah.
Look, Ted.
You can run the business right from here.
Juke can get all the drivers and we'll still make that run on schedule.
Make it ahead of schedule.
Juke,you stay here and help Celia.
Where you going?
I've got some private business to attend to.
Won't you come in?
Well, what can I do for you?
I just picked these up atJohn Armin's place.
Was I supposed to find them or are you getting careless?
That's one you'll have to figure out for yourself.
What's that for?
I was just figuring.
You must've needed the job bad to fire blank cartridges at a hired bandit in a fake holdup.
I needed a job bad. I didn't say a job. I said that particular job.
You have it all worked out, haven't you?
It wasn't hard to work out, Letty. Finding your gloves tied the whole thing together.
Very clever.
Wait a minute.
Was that bullet in Ted's leg part of your deal with Armin?
I had nothing to do with that. You mean you didn't actually fire the shot.
IfTed knew you were behind the shooting,
I reckon it would hurt him more than the bullet did.
What- What do you mean by that?
He's in love with you, Letty.
Cole Armin,
I arrest you for arson.
Arrest me?
Wait a minute. What is this?
Who made that complaint?
John Armin.
You had it all ready, didn't you?
The whole town heard you threatening to burn him out.
Come on.
Morning, Fred.
Sit down, Dave.
Hello, Mr. Cole!
Stand up, Cole Armin.
Now, Cole, you've testified that you were not in the vicinity of the fire, yet you refuse to tell us where you were.
Now,you realize, of course, if you have an alibi...
supported by a reputable citizen...
it'll have a distinct bearing on your case.
I have have nothing to add to my testimony, Your Honor.
Tell him where you was, Cole!
Go ahead! Tell him!
You keep quiet,Juke!
One more remark outta you, and I'll hold you in contempt of court.
But he's being stubborner than a jug-headed mule.
Sit down,Juke.
Tell him, Daddy.
Go ahead and tell him!
Uh, wait a minute, Fred.
Myrtle here told me something
I think you oughta know.
Well, if it concerns this case, why, bring her on up here, Dave.
Come on, honey.
Order. Order.
Go ahead, Myrtle.
Tell him just what you told me.
Now, go ahead and talk, honey.
Well, Mr. Your Honor, when my daddy ran to the fire last night,
I was scared to be alone, so I went to the window to look at the fire... and saw Mr. Cole running out of the house across the street.
And, uh
- Now, Myrtle, do you know who lives across the street?
Her-
I mean, Miss Letty.
Are you sure that that was the man you saw?
I'm pretty sure.
It was dark, but he was tall like him.
Yes, I'm pretty sure.
Well, that's, uh, a little irregular.
Now, honey, you have to be positive.
Your Honor, the defendant is my nephew.
And think we all feel he should be given every chance to clear himself.
Very possible
I have been mistaken.
If such is the case, now is the time to correct it.
Why not call Miss Tyler to the stand?
If she substantiates this testimony,
I'll gladly withdraw my complaint.
Miss Tyler, will you take the stand?
I can say if from here,Judge.
Cole Armin... was in my house with me last night.
Case dismissed.
John Armin, you've used my courtroom to air a private family squabble- for what reason,
I don't know and I don't care.
But I'm going to see that it doesn't happen again.
Cole Armin, from today's testimony of your wild threats,
I'm compelled to curb your evident appetite for trouble.
Now, to protect you gentlemen from each other,
I hereby order a peace bond executed over each of you... in the amount of $5,000.
Sheriff, carry out that order.
Court adjourned!
Celia. I- I reckon
I owe you an explanation.
I'm not interested in details, Cole.
You owe me nothing.
All right, Armin. You're in my custody until the bail bond's furnished.
It was right neighborly of you to come see me, honey, but, uh, you better run along home now.
Ajail's no place for a lady.
It is too, if that lady's best friend is locked up inside.
But I gotta stay here until they let me out.
Oh, no, you don't.
Here you are.
I got Clara all saddled and waiting.
She's watered and fed and can travel four days without sleep.
Now, get to work. I'll keep watch while you saw.
But that would be against the law and we've gotta respect the law.
All right. I'm gonna stand here until they let you out... if I have to stand till I'm a little old lady in a shawl.
I'll be a-sittin' here a- knittin' and a-waitin'.
Hello, Mr. Juke.
Hello.
Oh, there you are.
You come down here, young lady.
I want to have a talk with you. Don't you know your pappy's lookin' for you?
You better skedaddle home.
No, sir.
Not until Mr. Cole gets out.
Well, he's getting out.
I got the papers from the judge.
The sheriff's going in to turn him loose.
You'd better go in and keep an eye on him,
Mr. Juke. I don't trust that old sheriff.
Aw, don't you worry none about him, honey. I'll take care of him.
Run along now,
Heh heh heh.
Good-bye, Mr. Cole!
Come on, Clara. Reckon Mr. Cole won't be needin' us now.
Come on.
Juke just bailed you out.
I'm warning you, better keep a checkrein on that temper of yours.
Never mind the blabber. Give him his gun and we'll get out of here.
Where'd that bond money come from?
It was sort of a community affair.
Huh? Ted, Celia, Dave, Pearl
- we all had a hand in it.
We? Yeah. Borrowed some money on my mules.
Not Damon and Pythias? Well, we had to get you out of jail, didn't we?
Well, I sure wanna thank all of you.
Good way to prove that is to get outta town.
Otherwise your friends will lose $5,000.
'Course, it isn't your money.
Never mind.
Come on.
Well, I guess we won the first round, Cole.
You know,Juke, it don't take a smart man... to figure that my uncle's getting a bear trap ready for me.
All you gotta do is stay awake, son.
A man's only got so many fights to win, so many dreams to dream, so much loving and hating to do, and usually old age catches up with him... before he can correct any mistakes he's made.
What are you gettin' that? My biggest mistake, old-timer, was ever leaving Texas.
Aw, you can't say that, Cole, now.
Eating time for the patient.
Is that all I get? Food and medicine are measured out in doses for invalids.
Yes, but I wasn't shot in the stomach.
If you'd taken one step farther down, you would have been. You were lucky.
You know, bullets aren't the only thing that can tear you apart.
Disappointment in people can smash you too.
You're in love with Letty, aren't you?
I was. I guess we both picked the wrong person.
We have realities to face, Ted.
Good news, folks.
Well, I finally got all the drivers.
I had to pay 'em double when they heared it was Angel's Roost, but I got 'em.
We start the big climb at sunrise.
What about Cole?
Did you get him out of jail?
He's out, all right.
Out of town, probably.
Out of town?
Yeah.
He said it'd be better for all hands if he lit out.
Made a lot of mistakes here, he said.
Goin' back to Texas,
I reckon.
Somethin's gotta be done about this.
Oh, Myrtle.
Myrtle.
So the big Texas hero is crawlin' outta town.
I don't aim to fall into any ofJohn Armin's traps.
I reckon Celia Wallace would like to see you turnin' tail.
But don't you worry. I'll be callin' on her after you're gone.
Get up and fight.
Oh, man. If that's the way they fight in Texas, I'm staying in Albuquerque.
As I was saying, Miss Tyler,
you were brought here for a special purpose...
and you failed completely.
I don't think there's anything more to say to you... except that here's your ticket on the next stage.
The sheriff will see you to the depot.
I can find the way. I want to make sure that you get there safely.
I don't need any protection.
You'll need a lot of it if you're in this town after that stage leaves.
Come on, sister. I'll bet this isn't the first time you were escorted out of town.
Take you hands off me!
He busted his peace bond. From the looks of you, that isn't all he busted.
Hold the jokes, Linton.
Go on, Murkil.
Well, you-you told me to pick a fight with him. I did.
All right, Sheriff.
It's your move.
I'll seeJudge Martin and get a warrant for him for attempted murder.
That'll hold him in jail without bail just as long as I wanna keep him there.
Until you get tired of feeding him, then leave the jail door open and shoot him off his horse getting away.
I changed my mind, gentlemen.
I'm not leaving Albuquerque.
I'd advise you to change your mind back again.
No, you're going to change yours.
If you arrest Cole Armin and declare his peace bond forfeited,
I'll let out a yell that'll be heard in Washington.
And I have plenty to yell about, including my own part in it.
You're fixin' for a spell in jail, aren't you, lady?
I'll have company.
Murkil!
You ain't gonna let her get away with that, are you?
Yeah. You're the boss.
What are you gonna do?
Life in jail... if we can't stop her.
You got more than her to stop.
That Wallace outfit's gonna try the Angel's Roost run tomorrow... and they got the toughest hombres in New Mexico driving.
They ain't gonna stop at nothin'.
So they're gonna try for the high one, huh?
It's suicide. He might make it. He's an Armin.
Yes. He might.
Get word to Matt Wayne.
But there ain't no sense in you leaving, Cole.
The Wallaces need you, and they're mighty fine folks.
That's why I'm leaving.
Yes, but you don't have to.
I'll have more witnesses than you can get into Fred Martin's courtroom... that you was nettled into that fight.
Now, wait a minute, Dave.
It isn't that fight.
I'd still be under bond, and next time...
I'd kill Murkil and maybe Armin.
Hey, mister! We're shoving off for El Paso. You coming with us?
Good-bye, old-timer.
Good-bye, Mr. Cole. I feel awful.
Cole! Cole Armin!
So long, Dave.
Cole! Wait up there! Wait!
Hold that coach, driver! Cole!
Cole, I mean, you ain't going no place. What's all this?
Ask Letty.
Don't ask me how or why, but there'll be no further actions by the sheriff on that peace bond.
What's that?
You heared her.
Look, fella. I'm pulling out.
You leaving?
No, he ain't! Git a gettin'.
Come on, son.
Hyah! Hep! Hep!
Hey! Giddyap!
Good luck, Cole.
I'm bettin' on you.
I hope you win, Dave.
I gotta. I'm gonna send Myrtle to college with those winnings.
All right, folks, here's some easy money!
Murkil's laying 10-to-1 that
Wallace's outfit don't make the run!
I'll bet $ 10 they do make it! It's a bet.
Here you are.
I'll take 100 of that.
All right. I'll bet you 2-to-1 they don't even get up there.
I'll take that too.
All right. Alice.
Put me in for 20.
I'll bet you 20 they don't get down. 10-to-1 they don't.
I'd give a $ 1,000 to be on that lead wagon.
Juke will bring 'em through.
Why didn't you go down to the gate and wish 'em luck?
Somehow it didn't mean as much as I thought it would.
Well, after all, you know, Cole wouldn't have been much help.
He can't drive. It was his being here that made the difference.
I'd feel better if he was with them.
Yes. I know, Sis.
Strange, isn't it, how one person can become so important in your life... that without them nothing seems to matter.
It is strange.
We oughta be ashamed.
Thinking of ourselves when men and animals are risking their lives for us.
It's gonna take a lot of courage and luck to bring those wagons down.
All we can do is wait and hope for the best.
Maybe a little prayer from this end will help them... and us.
Stop running! Hup!
When is the next stage for Santa Fe?
If it's on time, it's due here in two hours and 15 minutes.
Well, that means more trouble.
Trouble?
It's Matt Wayne and his men. It's no secret here in town that they'reJohn Armin's gunmen.
Hold 'em here, Andy.
I'll see what the old man wants.
What do you want here?
I wanna see Ted.
Matt Wayne and his men just rode up to Armin's place.
Right now they're probably getting instructions to smash your outfit and Cole Armin too.
Cole Armin's on his way to Texas. He started for Texas, butJuke and I stopped him.
He's up there now helping to bring your wagons down from the Angel's Roost.
- Do you expect us to believe that?
- You will when you hear the rest.
You were wrong about Cole, Celia. He guessed that
I was working for his uncle, and he was right.
John Armin brought you to Albuquerque to get information about our plans?
Yes. Cole suspected me and that's why he came to my house the night of the fire.
Oh, you don't know what it means to hear that, Letty.
Where are you going, Sis?
It's time somebody in this family starting thinking about Cole.
You must've had a pretty good reason for changing over to our side, Letty.
I did.
I'll tell you when I have more time.
Now, boys, we're in for a tough job.
Y'all know what's ahead of you.
Remember what I told you.
If the shale starts slippin' or you get in any trouble, cut the animals loose and jump- let the wagons go over.
You understand?
Sure,Juke. We understand.
All right. Get up on your wagons.
I'll give the order to start.
All right, boys.
Come on. Let's get going.
I wanna wish both you boys a lot of luck. We'll need it.
Here we go, Cole.
Albuquerque or bust.
Good luck,Juke. I hope you make it. Make it?
Shucks, I can make that ride standing on my head.
Juke, one of your riders has run out.
Huh? Which one?
Jim Rough. Tearin' out for town on a horse. Must've had one here waitin' for him.
Doggone it. I was scared of that feller, but he's all there was left.
Armin hired every driver in town.
Armin probably hired him too.
Too bad.
I guess that hangs you up.
The agreement with Huggins was 10 wagons or no deal.
Tell Huggins it'll be 10 wagons.
H- Hey! Wait a minute, Cole.
Wait a minute!
Who's gonna drive Rough's wagon? I'm gonna try it.
Listen, this ain't no Wells Fargo four-up stagecoach on a flat Texas prairie. This is-
This is a 12-mule hitch on a bad mountain road. I know, I know.
I'm scared to let you try it. Listen, to tell you the truth, I'm twice as scared as you are.
But standing here arguing isn't getting that ore down to the mill.
Get on your wagon,Juke.
Now, mark this, Wayne.
If they every get down from that run, it means-
Is there any chance they won't make it?
There's a good chance they won't make it.
What do you want with him and his men?
To play safe on the off chance that they might make it.
I want this Wallace outfit destroyed, wiped out permanently... to show Albuquerque that I'm still running it.
You know what to do!
Now, get out, both of you!
¶¶
Hup, Damon.
Hey thar, Pythias.
Whoa. Hey.
Hey!
Ho!
Hey! Hold 'em back there, Cole!
Hold 'em back, Cole!
Hey,Juke!
Hyah! Damon, come on!
Hup! Damon, Pythias!
Come on, boys!
Stop 'em, Cole! Stop 'em!
I can't! Keep going,Juke!
Hyah, boys! Hyah!
Ho!
Hold 'em! Hold 'em, Cole!
Hyah, boys!
Stop 'em, Cole!
Ho!
Ho!
Ho!
Doggone it, Cole!
I told you ya couldn't drive.
What's the matter?
The brake snapped on me.
You mean you come down through all that shale with no brake? Yeah.
Why, the man ain't living that can do it.
I'm not sure I am living.
Mm. I thought we was both goners, us and the mules, when you come barreling down on us there.
Take a look at that.
Why, that weren't broke. It was sawed! That's what I'm talking about.
Come on. We got some business in Albuquerque. No, you don't.
You get up on that lead wagon.
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.
Now you makin' me feel a lot better. Thanks, pappy.
Yeah. Pappy? Hmm.
What's going on, Harvey?
Everybody's leaving town.
Well, can you blame 'em?
Matt Wayne and his men are back.
Better get your kids and head for home.
Maybe you're right.
Remember, no shootin' till the sheriff fires.
What is it, Celia? You look scared. I am, Cole. Terribly.
Is it Ted? Anything happen to him. No.
What's a matter now?
Why'd we stop?
The town's alive with Matt Wayne and his men. They're waiting for you.
It's wholesale murder, Cole, if you take a step farther.
We're obliged to you for the warning, Celia, but I reckon we can handle any trouble that comes along, eh,Juke?
"The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart. "
That's from the good book.
Now, if you folks will excuse me, I'll have the men gird their loins for battle.
I didn't figure you aimed to put yourself out for me anymore.
Well, thanks to Letty
I'm seeing things clearly again.
Uh-huh.
Listen, Cole, bringing the ore in isn't important now.
Your life is... to me.
Thanks, Celia.
You run along home now by the side roads.
And if by chance you should see Preacher Murray, tell him he's gonna have a couple of customers.
I will. Giddyap.
Take care of yourself, Cole! Giddyap!
I got a good reason to now!
Looks like the Armin Empire is going to war.
You're right, Miss Tyler.
Now you'll see what happens to people who oppose me.
The first sound of fire out there, you'll get a bullet in your back.
A gun with blank cartridges doesn't frighten me.
Blank cartridges?
Are you gonna get your men off that street?
I'm not changing my orders.
They get you, old-timer?
Aw,just nicked me.
Hey. Walton got here with the cavalry just in time, didn't he?
Mr. Armin! Mr. Armin!
Wait a minute, Pearl.
What now?
If I'm gonna make the supreme sacrifice,
I'll be dagblasted if I want the whole town watchin'.
Pull down that curtain.
<I>This is Wall Street,
And today was important because tomorrow, July 4th,
I intended to make my first million dollars-
An exciting day in any man's life.
Temporarily, the enterprise was slightly illegal.
You see, I was the lawyer for the numbers racket.
Buck on 823.
Good morning,
Mr. Morse.
Put a dime on 776 for me tomorrow.
How do you like that for luck, Bob?
Today's winner's 114.
I had a dime on 113.
Didn't I?
Yeah, you did.
I nearly made 60 bucks
Except for that one little digit.
600 to 1.
You going to play
776 tomorrow?
Nah, 823.
This morning, I nearly got hit by a car,
And you know what the last number
Of the license was?
I figure if I live through today, it's my lucky number.
Am I right,
Mr. Morse?
If you don't get killed,
It's a lucky day for anybody.
Nickel on 776.
That's a nickel.
The suckers bet on any combination of three numbers
Selected from the totals
Bet at some race track that day-
20 million bettors a day in the united states.
Tell Mr. Wheelock
I want to see him.
Annual income to cheap crooks and racketeers?
Over $100 million.
It seemed a shame
For so much good money to go to waste
In other people's pockets.
Yeah.
Oh, Mary, hold all my calls and cancel everything.
Well, make it for Friday.
Thank you.
Hello?
Mr. Tucker?
Well, sure. Put him on.
One minute, Hobe.
Hello, Ben?
Fine. Right. Right.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Bye.
Come in, Hobe.
Morning, Joe.
Morning. I wonder if you can help me out with this.
No shine today, Louie.
Thanks.
You know that new Galahad
The governor appointed-
Our new special prosecutor?
Link hall?
Yeah, hall.
His father was in the class
Ahead of me at Harvard.
You know the son?
I gave the boy a pony for his 4th birthday,
But I haven't seen a great deal of him since.
Since when?
Since the market fell in on me in '29.
Do you think you can manage
To invite the son up for dinner soon?
Why?
Well, I...
Louie, would you mind
Stepping out a moment, please?
Thank you.
If we knew which side of the street
Hall was working,
Our client, Mr. Ben Tucker, might appreciate it.
We don't want any collisions we don't have to have.
We've got a big retainer
To change the numbers racket
Into a legal lottery.
Uh, Joe... you usually know what you're doing,
But it's one thing to represent Tucker legally-
As his lawyer,
I mean.
I mean, it's the business of lawyers
To protect a lot of people.
They, uh... even teach that at Harvard.
Yes?
But the minute you start doing business for Tucker,
Doing Tucker's business, it's a different thing, Joe.
Lawyers are not protected from the law.
Tucker is making me rich, Hobe,
And I’m your partner who's making you rich.
I wear his old school tie,
And you wear mine.
You can buy one for yourself during lunch hour
Off any pushcart.
Louie.
Finish his shine.
How much have you got here, Joe?
There's another 60 in my office safe.
Well, there's
50 more here.
It will be more than plenty.
We only want to finance
12 of the banks, Joe,
The big ones-
And your brother's little bank, of course,
So it makes 13.
The rest can go to the wall,
And the combination will take over their trade.
You going up to see your brother now?
Can I be frank with you, Ben?
Edna always says that to me.
She says, "I’m going to be frank, Ben."
Then out it comes-
Something mean and terrible about me... or something foolish about herself.
I'll be foolish,
Ben.
I'm a lawyer-
Your clever little lawyer-
And I’ve taken over the formation
Of this numbers monopoly
To make it legal, respectable, and... very profitable for you,
And I’ve done it for two reasons.
What's the second reason?
Frankly, the first is money.
But the second reason is my brother.
He's 50 years old,
A man with heart trouble,
And when 776 hits tomorrow
And wipes out his capital,
It will wipe out his life.
He'll turn white and die... ashamed to be old and broke.
That's my problem.
He won't come into the combination
Unless I force him,
And I can't force him
Unless I tell him about 776.
You'll tell him nothing of the kind.
It's the only way,
Ben!
It's the only way to ruin us! No!
I tell you, it's safe!
No!
You'd better not go up
And see your brother at all.
Now, look, Joe.
Let's get the picture clear.
Tomorrow's the 4th of July,
The one day in the year
When there's a superstition
To bet one number-776.
Tomorrow, the nickels and dimes
And pennies of every sucker
Goes on 776, right?
That's right.
Now, we're fixing that number to hit,
And the bankers are going to go broke
Because they got no distribution
On the betting.
You know, I didn't have to invest all this money, Joe.
I could have called in my ex-Beer partner Ficco
With his handful of Chicago shooters
And just taken all those banks
Like I did beer in '27,
But you, you said no.
You're my smart lawyer.
Right?
That's right.
You said you were trying to work up public sentiment
To get a law passed making numbers a legal lottery,
Like lotteries are in Ireland or Cuba
Or like race track betting is here,
And that rough stuff would kill the chance dead.
And I said "all right,
Joe." Right?
Right.
I can't help it if you have a problem
With an older brother, Joe.
I can't risk $200,000 for sentimental reasons.
Don't worry about your brother, Joe.
He won't die of heart failure
As long as he remembers he has a rich brother.
Rich relatives are better
Than doctors or medicine men.
O.K., Ben, O.K.
And just remember, Joe,
You and I are the only ones who know about 776.
I have no reason to tell anybody.
Don't you trust me?
Of course
I trust you, Joe.
I just want you to know
How worried I am.
Got a match, mister?
Keep them.
I hadn't seen my brother Leo for years,
And here he was, back in the slums
Where we were born.
He ran a small numbers bank
The way another man runs a restaurant or bar.
These collection offices were called banks,
And they were like banks
Because money was deposited there.
They were unlike banks
Because the chances of getting money out
Were 1,000-To-1.
These were the odds against winning.
What do you want, mister?
I would like to see my brother Leo Morse.
I'm Joe Morse.
The banks were located behind poolrooms,
In lofts, cellars, or hidden in slum apartments like Leo’s.
Wait here a minute.
Big play on 776 today.
People got a superstition
To play it every 4th of July.
The old liberty number-
Never hits.
Mr. Morse, there's a man outside to see you
Who says he's your brother.
My brother?
What does he look like?
Like a firecracker, you dope-
Like your brother.
How are you, Leo?
What do you want,
Joe?
I came to see you, Leo.
Do I need a particular reason?
You wouldn't come around here
If you didn't have a particular reason.
What's the difference?
We're brothers.
Is it a social visit or a business visit?
I haven't seen you in an age.
What is it?
I'm busy.
Leo, I’ve come to take you out of this air shaft
And put you in a real office in a real business
To pay you back for everything
Because you're my older brother.
That's why I’m here.
Come around after I’m dead.
I had to fight to get this proposition for you, Leo.
I had to stick my neck way out.
Now, you listen to me!
Something very serious
Is about to happen to your business.
You're one of 20 or 30 numbers banks in the city-
One of the smaller ones.
Suppose a combine moves in.
Suppose it organizes and merges these banks,
Eliminating the little ones, like yours.
You're listening now, aren't you?
Suppose it reduces the overhead-
Legal fees, bail bonds.
Supposing it reduces the cost and guarantees the profits.
A man like you would be out of business, wouldn't you?
You couldn't compete, could you?
But suppose you had a brother
And this brother made your bank the number-One bank
In the combination, in the merger,
In the corporation.
What corporation?
Tucker?
Come in.
I've got the tickets for the winners, Mr. Morse.
And what does this corporation
Expect from me, brother Joe?
In return for the organization-
I have no secrets from Doris.
If you want to talk, talk. If not, go.
In return for the organization and service,
In return for taking you into the combination,
The corporation gets 2/3 of the profits and you get 1/3-
2/3 for Tucker, brother Joe, and 1/3 for me,
For my own business?
Do you know what that is, Joe?
Blackmail! That's what it is! Blackmail!
My own brother blackmailing me!
You're crazy!
You're absolutely crazy mad!
You're not listening to me!
I don't want it!
You know why you don't want it?
I'll tell you why, because you're a small man.
Because if it's a small thing, you're a tiger.
But if it's a big thing,
You shout and yell and call me names.
"Oh, no, a million dollars for Leo?
"Oh, no, must be the wrong address.
It must be somebody next door."
The answer is no!
You understand your "no" won't stop
The merging of these banks, yours included!
Leo, Leo, this is your chance,
The one
I got for you.
You take your chance, Joe, and get out of here.
I'm an honest man here,
Not a gangster with that gangster Tucker!
Are you telling me, a corporation lawyer,
That you're running a legitimate business here?
What do you call this?
Payoffs for gambling.
An illegal lottery. Policy.
Violation 974 of the penal code.
Policy-The numbers racket.
I do my business honest and respectable!
Honest? Respectable?
Don't you take the nickels, and dimes and pennies
From people who bet,
Just like every other crook,
Big or little, in this racket?
They call this racket "policy"
Because people bet their nickels on numbers
Instead of paying their weekly insurance premium.
That's why-Policy.
That's what it is, and that's what it's called.
And Tucker wants to make millions,
You want to make thousands,
And you, you do it for $35 a week,
But it's all the same, all policy!
This is my secretary,
My stenographer,
My friend
Doris Lowry.
She's been with me a long time.
She's like a daughter to me.
And you...
I wanted to be the lawyer,
And I could have been the lawyer
If I threw you out of the house
When our parents died,
But, no, I worked for you like a fool.
For you!
And I gave you everything!
Why do you talk this way to me in front of strangers?
She's no stranger to me!
You're the stranger!
And I’ll tell the whole world
Because you're my brother.
And I owe it to the whole world,
Because you're my brother, what you are-
A crook and a cheat and a gangster.
Leo, be calm.
Tucker will make you honest
Tucker will make you respectable.
He's giving me a quarter of a million dollars
To create public sentiment to make policy legal,
Like bingo, bango, and the Irish sweepstakes.
I'm paying you back, Leo.
I'll make you rich,
With an office on wall street up in the clouds!
Be calm, Leo.
Be sensible.
All right. I am sensible.
I am calm.
I'll give you my answer calmly and sensibly.
My final answer.
My final answer is finally no.
The answer is no-
Absolutely and finally no,
Finally and positively no!
No! No! No!
N- O!
Bunte, this is Morse.
Are you clean? Can I talk?
I want you to get a tip in to the police
So they throw a raid into my brother's bank.
I'll take the responsibility.
I want this done right away, this afternoon.
I want my brother to know that Tucker is running policy.
I want to force him in.
I'm on the street.
Let's not make a big spiel out of this.
I want my brother kept in jail till I get him out.
Going home, Doris?
Yes, Mr. Morse,
But I wanted to talk to you first if I could.
About what?
Well, that's not very easy to say, Mr. Morse.
It's not very easy to say.
I've been thinking about it all afternoon.
If there's something you want to say,
Say it, Doris.
Well, I just wanted to say that-
You know I’m grateful
For everything you've done for me.
You know that, don't you?
You sound so sad.
Is there something wrong?
Has something happened?
I haven't forgotten
That you gave me my first job, Mr. Morse.
Believe me,
I haven't forgotten it.
And I haven't forgotten how, when times were bad
And you had no money to take home,
I always had my salary.
I haven't forgotten that.
You sound as though you were leaving me, Doris.
No, Mr. Morse,
I’m not leaving you.
There's nothing
I wouldn't do
For you or Mrs. Morse.
You've both been so kind.
But I’m leaving this job.
Something my brother said upset you.
Black sheep like to make everybody else look black.
That's right, and it's very easy when they are black.
But I’m only here to say that all afternoon
I've been thinking that's the way I feel now,
And I simply can't work here anymore, Mr. Morse.
I simply can't.
I have to leave.
Then leave.
Then quit.
You're young, Doris.
You'll discover as you grow older
That sometimes a man does things
He'd prefer not to do.
I'm not trying to say anything about you, Mr. Morse.
I'm only talking about myself
And why I feel
I can't stay here.
Then leave.
I'm sorry, Mr. Morse.
Thanks for the tears.
That Mr. Morse's brother is Tucker's lawyer,
Isn't he, Mr. Bauer?
He's worse.
He's Tucker's brain.
That's
Tucker's brain.
What are you talking about?
Who is it?
Open up. The police.
Go on! Open up!
Hey!
Stay where you are!
Don't anybody move.
The other door!
Open up!
Open up!
Open up!
What's going on here?
Sorry, Mr. Morse.
You did that too late.
Everybody gone crazy all of a sudden?
Who sent you?
We got a warrant-
Violation 974.
Milletti's office.
What's going on,
Mr. Morse?
That's all right.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
It'll be all right.
Policeman: now listen, everybody.
We're going downstairs quietly, you understand?
In single file.
There's a patrol wagon at the curb.
Who are you calling, Mr. Morse?
Hello! Hello!
Ruddy, please.
Leo Morse.
Who do you think you're pushing around here?
Ruddy? Guess what.
The whole place is full of police.
No, they dropped in for tea!
Never mind.
I'm taking it easy!
Milletti, yes!
Where are your handcuffs?
My lawyer will meet us with a key.
This lady was just visiting here to see a friend.
She doesn't work for me.
That's got nothing to do with me.
Please,
Mr. Lieutenant,
I can't ride in the patrol wagon.
It's too narrow, and it's too dark!
Don't put him in the patrol wagon.
Put him in a taxi.
I'll pay the fare.
Taxi? We're not going to a dance, Mr. Morse.
The wagon's no good for him.
He's a sick man.
He's got a complex.
Claustrophobia.
I can't help it.
I got it!
When he was a taxi driver,
His cab fell in the river with him.
He got a disease under the water, a fear.
He can't stand being cramped in a small, dark space.
He should have thought of that
Before he began committing violations.
We'll let him ride up front in the open.
Come on.
Don't give your right name
So your mother won't read it in the paper.
Oh, please, Mr. Morse.
Mary, what took you so long to answer?
Has my brother called yet?
Well, he will, the dumb mule.
No, I’m still at Tucker's apartment.
I'll be here.
Yes.
Nothing yet,
Joe?
No, Ben, nothing yet.
But he'll call.
The spot I put him in,
Where else can he go for help?
Let's get on with this.
Sit down.
I've got $25,000 for you to play with, two & two.
Will that be enough?
You'll get change.
Does he know exactly what he has to do?
I been telling him all day.
He knows it like a poem.
What number do we want hit?
776. Don't worry,
Mr. Morse.
It will come out 776.
One-I throw in the last layoff bet
On the third race.
Johnson's lined up the tote clerks to help me there.
Two-I throw in enough of a bet
To make the last three digits on the odds pay-Off
Come out 7, 7, and 6.
Three-All the change that's left over from the 25
You give me, I give back to Johnson,
Or I’m in trouble with Johnson.
Four-The minute it's 776 on the tote board,
I check in at Mr. Morse's telephone number-
Bowling green 7-5432.
Five-I meet Johnson at his office
9:00 tomorrow night
And get paid.
And the telling.
The telling.
I swear on my grave, the bible,
I tell nobody nothing and forget how I did it,
Or I’m in trouble with Johnson.
Fine.
Give me the totals on this.
Say that again, will you?
I was wondering, Ben.
Everybody downtown
Is walking around on tiptoe,
And I was wondering if we couldn't
Ease up a little on this thing
For the time being.
Look, Bunte, you look after the politics.
I'll take care of the business.
It's a normal operation.
776 will hit tomorrow because Taylor makes it hit.
Tomorrow night, every bank in the city is broken,
And we step in and lend money to those we want
While we let the rest go to the wall.
We're normal financiers.
Nothing's normal downtown
Since the governor set hall up in business.
Tucker: does he get the cigar?
Hmm. He gets the cigar.
Ben, I’ll call night court again.
How do you do a thing like this?
I was born that way, like a man with two heads
Or a dope with a million bucks.
It's my gift.
Oakhurst station house.
Sergeant Denute speaking.
This is Joe Morse.
Is my brother there?
Yes, Mr. Morse.
We have the pleasure of his company.
Put him on the phone.
It's irregular to without-
Well, see if you can, please.
One minute,
Mr. Morse.
Hello?
He says he don't want to talk to you.
Tell him I want to help get him out of there.
Tell him I want to talk to him.
One minute, please.
Sometimes, you act like a human being,
Like a person who worries.
You're wide-Open, Joe.
I can see into you without looking.
Don't bother.
Besides, it's not nice to do.
More interesting than when you have
A rock for a husband, like mine.
He's a stone, that man.
Whole world are rocks and stones to him.
Why tell me?
Tell him.
Never tell him anything.
Makes me feel unnecessary.
If I make you feel necessary,
Then I’m making a mistake.
Hello,
Mr. Morse?
Well?
Mr. Morse, your brother says
Write him a letter.
I ought to let him rot in there.
At least a woman could tell
Whether you were happy or sad.
She could be happy or sad with you.
Just because
I’m killing myself
Over that dumb brother of mine
Doesn't mean I’m ready to die for anyone else.
Where can I call home?
Right around the corner, lady.
All that Cain did to Abel was murder him.
I had nothing to do with it.
All right, you didn't,
But thanks for paying my fine
And unlocking me with the same key
You used to lock me up with.
After tonight, Leo, it will be too late.
Too late, I tell you.
I'll tell you something more, Joe.
You opened my eyes tonight,
And the police opened them further.
I'm closing up after tomorrow.
I'm taking my capital and getting out.
I'm through.
I'm finished.
Then get out tonight.
Close up tonight.
Don't wait for tomorrow.
I'm not that big a crook.
People have bets in my bank.
That's a debt.
I'll pay off what I owe tomorrow, whatever it is,
And then I’m finished.
I'll be able to look in the mirror
And see my face, not yours.
Leo, I’m trying to help you.
Cup of coffee and a glass of milk.
Coffee's cold, sir.
It's a hot night anyway.
I'll have $10,000,
$15,000 for my capital.
That's all the help
I’ll need,
But there is one thing you can do.
Anything, Leo, if you'll only listen to me.
You listen to me.
That girl Doris, she needs help.
She quit just before the raid
You tipped off the police to on my bank,
And now, like the rest of us, she's got a misdemeanor
And a fine against her.
She's lost her references, and it's all your fault.
You've got fancy friends down on Wall Street.
She's a good secretary.
Get her a job.
I'll thank you for that, for her, not for me.
I'll do that, but if anything happens, Leo-
What could happen that
I would need your help?
Oh, I better see Bauer home.
Would you like a lift, miss Lowry?
No.
What am I around here, a leper?
Just like the rest of us, Mr. Morse,
Only they haven't caught up with you yet.
I got you all out.
I paid your fines.
What do you want from me, Mr. Morse?
I've got my whole life to think about now,
And you won't be of any help.
How do you know?
You know, everything
I touch turns to gold.
It's raining out,
And I promised my brother to take you home.
Well, that's a lie.
Well, it's not true, but I would have had he asked.
You know, you can't tell about your life
Till you're all through living it.
Come on,
I’ll give you a lift.
You're tired, I’m tired.
What can happen to either one of us?
You tell me the story of your life,
And maybe I can suggest a happy ending.
I went to a business college for 10 weeks
Because my mother wanted to give me advantages.
You have many advantages, Doris.
So did you.
I've known Leo since I was 13.
I've heard about you since then.
What did you hear?
Oh, story of the prodigal brother
Who never came home,
How much Leo did for you,
How little you did for yourself... the wild boy in the streets,
The wild man who said
He was a wildcat in the jungle.
That's what I heard.
Your brother kept me on
Even when business was bad.
I guess that's why I pretended to believe
What he pretended to believe-
That running a lottery was not so bad.
Now my name's in a book,
My fingerprints are in a file,
And no matter how long I live,
People will remember and know it,
And I’ll remember and know it.
Oh, I’ll know it.
Forget it. You were just a telephone caller
Came into the police station,
And it was a wrong number.
How does it feel to be a wrong number, miss Lowry?
Not very nice,
Mr. Morse.
Not very nice.
Blame me. Blame me.
Everybody does.
They do.
Keep the change.
You're a strange man,
And a very evil one.
And you're a sweet child,
And you want me to be wicked to you.
Now what are you talking about?
Because you're wicked, really wicked.
What are you talking so crazy for, Mr. Morse?
Because you're squirming for me to do
Something wicked to you-
Make a pass for you, bowl you over, sweep you up,
Take the childishness out of you,
And give you money and sin.
That's real wickedness.
What are you trying
To make me think,
Mr. Morse?
What are you trying
To make me think about myself... and you?
Do you know what wickedness is?
If I put my hand in my pocket
And gave you a ruby, a million-Dollar ruby
For nothing, because you're beautiful
And a child with advantages
And because I wanted to give it to you
Without taking anything for myself-
Would that be wicked?
Have you got one?
No.
You know, when I was a little girl,
Magicians used to fool me, Mr. Morse,
With their high hats and their black capes
And their ruby rings
Because I listened to what they said-
They talked so fast-
Instead of watching what they did.
I'm a big girl now
With a police record, thanks to you,
And I know it's not wicked
To give and want nothing back.
It's perversion.
Don't you see what it is?
It's not natural.
To go to great expense for something you want,
That's natural.
To reach out to take it,
That's human, that's natural.
But to get your pleasure from not taking,
From cheating yourself deliberately
Like my brother did today,
From not getting, from not taking... don't you see what a black thing that is
For a man to do?
How it is to hate yourself and your brother,
Make him feel that he's guilty,
That... that I’m guilty?
Just to live and be guilty.
July 4th, independence day,
Was a normal day at the race track.
Some horses won.
Some horses lost.
The sun shone equally on the rich and the poor,
But for Tucker and me,
A million-Dollar business was at stake.
The numbers banks exploded into bankruptcy
As the lucky players won.
But I had a last proposition for my brother
To save his money, to save his life,
To clear my conscience.
And I went up to see him and his wife.
Hello, Sylvia. I was in the neighborhood,
So I thought
I’d drop in.
Hello, Leo.
I heard what happened today,
So I came up to tell you
It can be the happiest day of your life.
You lost a crooked little peanut stand.
Now you can open up on fifth avenue.
I don't know what he's got in mind, Leo,
But it's not for you.
I'm sorry we've got no money,
But I’m not sorry you're through
With the gambling business.
You never listen to me, Leo.
Listen to me now.
What's your advice,
Sylvia?
You're a thief.
A thief's advice is no good.
Listen, Leo, you go down to your business tomorrow,
And I’ll be there, and I’ll see to it
That you get out of the business
In a couple months a rich man.
Don't have anything to do with him, Leo.
You're a businessman.
Yes.
I've been a businessman all my life.
And, honest, I don't know what a business is.
Well, you had a garage, you had a real-Estate business.
A lot you know.
Real-Estate business?
Living from mortgage to mortgage,
Stealing credit like a thief.
And the garage-
That was a business.
3 cents overcharge on every gallon of gas-
2 cents for the chauffeur and a penny for me.
Penny for one thief,
2 cents for the other.
Well, Joe’s here now.
I won't have to steal pennies anymore.
I'll have big crooks to steal dollars for me.
I've got it fixed for you the way I said
Because you're my brother.
That's why I’m here.
To tell you it's not so bad.
Well, I’ll have to go down
To the office anyway.
Why?
Even a bankrupt has to put his books in order.
I'll be there, Leo,
With a new set of books for you.
All right.
Let's eat.
If you're here,
You might as well sit down
And have some supper.
Thanks, I... I have a few things to attend to.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
Good night, Sylvia.
Well, if it isn't miss Lowry.
How are you,
Doris?
You look fine in my roses.
Where are you going?
Upstairs.
I'm having dinner
With your brother and his wife.
I wouldn't go up there, Doris.
Why? I go up there all the time.
Don't you have anything better to do?
I'm free the rest of the night.
Well, enjoy your freedom.
I wouldn't interrupt them up there.
They're in the wrong mood.
You see, I dropped
A million dollars in their laps,
And they're learning how to count.
They're waiting for me, Mr. Morse.
I'm in a wonderful mood, Doris-
Happy, relaxed... wouldn't you like to find out
How charming I am?
Why not?
Now I’ve lost the elevator.
I'll get you a better one.
Wouldn't you like to celebrate
On a really large scale, miss Lowry?
What are you celebrating, Mr. Morse?
A clear conscience.
Oh? Whose?
Now, don't be self-Righteous, Doris.
I don't approve of you instinctively.
I don't approve of myself.
See? We agree.
Come out with me,
And I’ll wine you and dine you and dance you.
And in the early hours of the morning,
When you're relaxed and tired, I’ll...
I’ll kiss you good night.
I don't think you'd enjoy my company, Mr. Morse.
Of course not, but you'd enjoy mine.
Don't say no when you want to say yes,
And don't say yes when you want to say no.
You're like Leo.
He wanted to come into the combination all the time
But he wanted to be forced, the way you do,
In order to maintain a moral superiority over me
Which doesn't exist.
Did you make him come into this Tucker thing with you?
Did you make him do that?
I pretended to make him,
And he pretended to be forced.
Is that what you want?
There must be something in you
That's evil and corrupt.
If you're going to preach, you need a soapbox.
You're not very receptive tonight.
That's because you don't know what you want from me,
But when you come down
To the office tomorrow for that job,
I'll try again.
You'll never see me there.
I still have that ruby, Doris.
You got $35 a week working for Leo.
I'll get you 100,
And I’ll bet you a barrelful of roses you'll be there.
Joe.
Who are you?
It's our bookkeeper,
Mr. Johnson.
It's Mr. Bauer.
This is a fine time to be getting in.
From now on, get here on time.
Leo: the rest of you,
If you don't want to cooperate, leave now.
All right.
Combination supplies the financing
On the following terms-
The capital we advance to pay off 776
Is to be a prior lien on the business itself
With regular 6% interest and a $5,000 bonus
For making the loan.
It's to be paid off by the week, so much a week,
As much as the business can handle.
And each banker gets a drawing account
Of 75 a week till the debt's paid off,
Then 1/3 of the profits.
Is that clear?
You're a bookkeeper now
For a big organization,
Mr. Bauer.
Mr. Richards,
I won't waste time.
I've got bad news for you.
I'm getting used to it.
Mr. Morse, I got to speak to you right away.
Excuse me.
Now, Bauer, what's the trouble?
Just like Doris,
Mr. Morse-I'm quitting.
I just wanted to tell you
So you could get somebody else for tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
This place makes me sick.
You've got eyes, Freddy.
You can see for yourself I’m not alone in business anymore.
Mr. Morse, what did you put me into?
I didn't put you into anything.
They put me!
Did you put me into this
Without my knowing or saying?
Did you do a thing like this to me?
You came to work in a racket
Because you wanted the extra money.
Now you'll get a raise.
You're working for a big corporation
Instead of a little man.
You're bookkeeper for 13 banks instead of one.
You're getting ahead in the world.
I don't want it!
I'm not your slave!
Wait a minute.
Leo, what's the trouble?
He wants to quit.
If he quits, how will
I handle the merger?
All right, you go in and write off
The rest of those gravestones.
I'll talk to Bauer.
I'll tell you the truth, Joe,
I don't have the stomach
For this kind of business.
What do you mean,
"this kind of business"?
Every organization has to rely
On its people when it needs them. Go ahead.
Mr. Bauer, will you come in here a moment?
Mr. Bauer...
I’d like to straighten out
Whatever trouble there seems to be here if I can.
There's no trouble.
I just want to quit.
Is that fair?
Maybe it isn't, but that's what I want to do.
Why go out of your way to make trouble for yourself?
What do you mean?
Well, we're reorganizing the whole business now.
We need every man's loyalty at this time.
You can't make me stay.
You can't.
How can you make me?
What are you going to do?
I want to be friends with all you people.
I'm looking ahead to where we can work
On a nice, friendly basis.
I don't believe in an employer
Who has to say to his people, "you've got to."
I like an employer whose people do things
By themselves because they like to,
Because they're loyal to the business.
If I go now and walk out of here,
How are you gonna stop me?
How, if I say I won't stay and walk out of here,
How are you gonna stop me?
The combination will stop you, Bauer-
Stop you dead... in your tracks.
You see, Mr. Bauer,
I’m just trying to help.
What do you say?
Now, if you have any more trouble,
Just let me know, and I’ll try
To straighten it out for you.
That's my job.
Good night, everybody.
Good night.
I think I’m going to quit this job.
I don't like working in a place
Run by gangsters
And where they have police raids.
See this nickel?
It belongs to Tucker,
And so do we.
Well, I’m going to quit, just the same.
It frightens me to work here.
What are you talking about?
We can't quit.
They won't let us.
You heard them.
They said they'd kill me if I quit.
They said they'd kill you,
Mr. Bauer.
You're the head bookkeeper here.
They need you.
They don't need us.
Maybe we'll all be without a job soon.
I read in the papers where hall said
He's going to raid these banks out of business.
And he could, too,
If he knew where all the banks were
And where they moved each time.
Are you coming,
Mr. Bauer?
No. I have a few things to do yet.
Good night.
Hello? I want
Mr. Hall's office.
Hello?
I want to report
A policy bank-
A numbers bank.
I want you to raid them right away,
Tomorrow when they open for business.
And when they open again,
I want you to raid them again.
Wherever they open,
I’ll tell you where.
I want them raided out of business.
Never mind who I am.
If you raid this bank,
I'll tell you where the others are, too.
And if they move,
I'll tell you where they move to.
The address is 1721 Edgecombe.
I can't talk anymore now.
Just a minute there.
I want to talk to you.
You're Bauer.
Who are you?
I'm Wally.
I got a proposition for you, Bauer-
A chance to make a little money for yourself
On the Q.T., under the rose.
I'm not interested in any propositions.
Just a minute.
I'm doing a job for bill Ficco.
He used to be
Tucker's partner
In the beer days.
What's that got to do with me?
Ficco's going into the numbers business.
He needs a little information,
And I’m trying to help.
He wants a list of Tucker's banks,
The bankers, the collectors,
The controllers.
He wants to arrange a meeting with Leo Morse
To discuss the matter.
Why don't you ask Mr. Morse?
He'd be afraid to get together with Ficco
On account of Tucker.
We're the competition.
But if you could get
Leo Morse
To some quiet place, we'd be there.
That's all you have to do.
Just get him there, and we'll do the rest.
I don't want to have anything to do with gangsters.
What do you mean, gangsters?
It's business.
Good night,
Mr. Wheelock.
Good night.
Good night, Mary.
Good night.
Hey! What is this, a parade?
I guess so.
Good night.
Take the rest of the day off.
Mr. Morse, there's someone waiting to see you
In the office.
Want that ruby, don't you?
Wheelock: Joe, may I see you a moment?
Excuse me.
Mrs. Tucker's been waiting to see you
For over a half-Hour.
Good night,
Mr. Morse.
Mrs. Tucker?
What does she want?
You, apparently.
She wouldn't take a substitute.
Handsome woman.
Have you, uh, seen hall?
Yes. We're talking.
Well, what's it look like, Hobe?
I don't know, Joe.
Just talking.
Fine. Good night.
Good night.
Wait for me, Doris.
I won't be long.
What's on your mind, Edna?
I couldn't telephone, so I came down in person.
Telephone about what?
Telephone you about the telephone.
What about the telephone?
Your prosecutor friend hall
Has tapped
Ben’s telephone.
Ben has to expect those things.
Hall is in the business,
And Ben Tucker is his stock in trade.
That's why
Ben sent me.
So are you.
I'm an attorney.
Legally, I’m in a fiduciary relationship
With your husband.
Is your telephone with hall?
Well, you tell Ben he has nothing to worry about.
Wiretapping evidence isn't always admissible.
I'll look it up for him.
Look it up for yourself, too,
While you're at it.
Ben tells me if you listen carefully,
If you try it several times,
You can catch them at it.
You can hear a little click.
Little click.
That's someone lifting a receiver off the hook-
The man who listens.
Have you ever used
That telephone of yours
For anything he shouldn't hear?
I use it for everything.
I'm at the disposal of my clients.
You might spend the rest of your life
Trying to remember what you shouldn't have said.
What are you riding me for?
If the phone is tapped, it's tapped.
Don't get sore just because you're scared.
Why don't you test it and see?
That's what Ben did.
That's what he would do.
Did Ben tell you to come here,
Or did you offer to deliver the message?
I offered.
Why are you always offering
To deliver bad news to me?
What do you want?!
What are you waiting to see?!
What kind of a man you are-You really are.
Try it on your own man.
I'm trying you.
What are you afraid of, to show you're afraid?
If you need a broken man to love,
Break your husband.
I'm not a nickel.
I don't spend my life on a telephone.
If that's what you want for love,
You can't use me.
You're not strong or weak enough.
Come in.
Is there anything else
Before I go,
Mr. Morse?
Yes.
You can show
Mrs. Tucker out.
I had expected a certain amount of trouble from hall-
I'd figured on it-
But it was a little shocking to find out
That he'd moved in so fast.
It was something to worry about
And something to take care of
And something to remember.
Conversations over the phone aren't much use
As legal evidence,
But they tell a smart lawyer
Where the evidence can be found,
What it might be.
It was the first step in making a case
Against the combination,
And the combination was
Ben Tucker and myself.
When you make a living, you accept the risks,
But I had taken an extra risk because of Leo
To give him confidence.
I had shown my face to the bankers that morning.
I had been tough with Bauer
To make it easy for Leo.
People can be made to talk.
Was my phone talking, too?
A man could spend the rest of his life
Trying to remember what he shouldn't have said.
Woman's voice: at the tone,
The time will be
7:23 and 1/4.
I had forgotten Doris for a moment,
And then I was glad she was there, waiting.
She was someone to talk to.
We walked down Wall Street to trinity church,
And she kept watching me,
Wondering what had happened there in that office of mine.
I think she had made up her mind
To fall in love with me.
And I wouldn't have minded at another time.
It would have been a change from the kind of women I knew.
She wanted me to talk, to tell her, to convince her
That I didn't realize what I was doing,
That I didn't understand the business I was in,
But I enjoyed the idea of convincing her that I did.
When was it, Mr. Morse, that Tucker walked in?
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you, Doris, how the boom was on,
And I could feel money
Spread all over the city like air,
Like perfume from those flowers I gave you.
I could breathe the smell of money.
And was that when Tucker walked in?
Yes. And I’m a man.
What have I got to do with Tucker?
But he opened his pocket, and I jumped in headfirst.
I sat there and measured my strength.
I had so much, Doris-
That's the way I figured-
So much strength,
And it all worked out this way.
I didn't have enough strength to resist corruption,
But I was strong enough to fight for a piece of it.
And now you want to get out.
Is that what your trouble is?
My trouble is, miss Lowry, that I feel like midnight,
And I don't know what the morning will be,
Except, for a little while,
I felt pretty easy here,
Talking to you, liking you.
You're the only one
I ever talk to, Doris.
You're the only one
I ever talk to,
And I don't know why,
Except that you caught me tonight
When I would have talked to the devil.
But I... thank you.
It's the truth, Doris.
A man doesn't tell lies at midnight,
But now I talk to you because you're Doris.
You see how lovely that makes you?
What are you now?
Someone to say,
To fool himself or me, that... that you love me?
Not so soon.
I won't tell you that,
But it would be such a comfort to me
To kiss you.
Is that strange?
No.
No, that isn't strange.
Are you from the bus company?
Why? Would you like to buy a bus?
You look like somebody I used to know
In the downtown detective office.
I do?
What's his name?
I didn't know him that good.
I just used to see him around.
I'm a bus inspector.
If you have a complaint to make about the service,
I'll take it.
Hello, Mr. Bauer.
Hello, Doris.
You leave early today?
No. I wasn't feeling so good today,
So I didn't come in,
And then I decided to come in,
But now I don't feel so good again.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm just going up to say good-Bye and get my things.
I'll tell Mr. Morse for you.
No. It'll look better since I got so far
To tell him myself.
All right.
Step lively.
Let's go.
Say, miss, you forgot your hat.
No! I can't ride in a patrol wagon!
All right, come on.
I'm not going in-
Come on!
Let me go! Let me go!
I don't work here!
I don't work here!
Our case is up next, Ben.
I just told the district attorney's office
We'll plead guilty.
It'll be top fines all around.
Anybody can pay fines.
If someone can buy a raid on one of my banks
For a nickel phone call,
I want my $50,000-A-Year politician
To tell me why.
Why and how is what
I want to know-
Why and how and who.
It's one of those things.
It's one of those things
I don't like.
This is goodspeed, Ben.
One of our bankers.
Well, let's hear.
I was taking my dog out for a walk
When they picked me up in this car.
It was Ficco.
You remember Ficco from the beer days?
What is this with Ficco, Ben?
Well, go on.
Don't make a book of it.
Ficco wanted to know
The whole who's who on the banks-
Where they were, who the bankers were,
The facts and figures on the combination.
I told them I didn't know because I don't.
Then they kicked me around a little,
Took a century out of my pocket,
And dumped me.
Is that all?
We never had anything like this
Before you came into the picture, Ben.
What'll I do?
Sell your dog.
What is it, Ben?
What's happening?
I know what Ficco wants,
And he's not going to get it.
He was up last night asking for it.
He knows about hall, too,
And he thinks a little rough stuff
Will scare us into bringing him in.
I told him to his face, hall or no hall,
If he wants to make a deal with us,
He'll make it with a gun.
Now's the time to be sensible, Ben.
I am sensible.
But I’ll see you all in the gutter,
And I’ll see myself in the gutter,
Before I lose one nickel of the money
I've invested in this combination.
I didn't bring Leo into the combination
To take a beating,
But that's what it's going to be from now on in.
I can smell it in the air, and I want him out.
I want him paid off and out.
I want him out tonight.
That's a fine way to talk to me, Joe,
After we establish him in the trade
As the number-One bank.
I'll take over instead then.
I'll pay off Leo and take over myself personally.
That's O.K.
With me, Joe.
The minute you start working
Out of the banks,
Meeting a hundred people, a day, handling details,
You won't be able to say
You're just
Tucker's attorney.
You'll be
Tucker's partner.
But suit yourself about your brother.
The people versus Leo Morse...
I think we're on now.
Doris Lowry,
Frederick Bauer, Edgar Ryan...
She's in there,
Mr. Morse.
Can't you see I’m busy talking to someone?
I want to talk to you, Doris.
Just send me a bill.
I'll pay your fee.
So I’ll be right home, mother. Don't worry.
I don't have time to argue with you.
I wanted to say how sorry
I was for all this,
But it doesn't seem necessary.
I'm perfectly all right.
You'd better worry about Leo,
And you'd better worry about yourself.
When you make a living, you accept the risks,
But that has nothing to do with you.
I kept watching you in the courtroom, and I... and what, Joe?
If I ever thought of loving you,
It was to love something rotten
And corrupt in myself.
I don't wish to love you or see you or know you,
And I’ll try not to remember you.
I didn't ask you to go down there.
You forced Leo to stay in the business.
He wanted it.
You tempted him,
The way you try to tempt me now
To forget what's so plain here in front of me.
Well, you'll see.
Leo's not like you.
He'll die of this.
Oh, you'll make him rich-
In his death.
Well, I don't wish to die of loving you.
Leo, I arranged with Tucker for you to quit tonight.
I'll pay off your investments.
I don't want it, Joe.
The money I made in this rotten business
Is no good for me, Joe.
I don't want it back.
And Tucker's money is no good, either.
The money has no moral opinions.
I find I have, Joe.
I find I have.
And now I’m speaking to you.
I'm speaking to you as your older brother
Who slaved for you.
You stop now.
Stop now, Joe,
Because I’m getting old, and old people die.
There will be nobody to cry for you.
I'll get you the money, and you're out.
Freddy.
You come along with me, Freddy.
I want to get a glass of water.
I'm going down to my office.
Mr. Morse, I just want you to know something.
I want you to know
That every time a tip comes over the phone,
You're going to get a raid-
Whoever you are and whoever you know.
Go ahead and raid,
Mr. Detective.
You're talking to a retired man.
And next time, Mr. Bauer-
Next time you call,
Just ask for Egan, the bus inspector.
You'll get personal service.
You, you, you... do you want to kill yourself?
To get yourself killed?
Hello?
This is Wheelock.
Got everything else,
But I can't get into the safe.
He must have changed the combination.
All right.
I'm leaving now.
I knew I would never come back to this fancy office again.
I could see the cobwebs on the walls
And a sign-
"Office for rent for a smart young lawyer
Trying to get ahead in the world."
Go in and get your rolls.
I'll wait for you.
Freddy!
Dumb, rotten dog.
Freddy!
Freddy!
Freddy.
Freddy!
You stupid fool!
Do you know what you're doing?
Let me alone.
What do you think you're doing?
Do you want to make a butcher of my brother?
A murderer?
You want to live, don't you?
You want to live to eat these, don't you?
Let me alone, please.
Don't say that to me.
I'll kill you with my own hands
Rather than let you
Put the mark of Cain on my brother.
Remember me, Bauer?
I'm Wally.
Now's the time to set up that meeting
Between Ficco and Leo Morse-
Tonight.
I can't do a thing like that.
Come on, Bauer.
I'll show you how you can get out of this jam-
Alive.
Your friend didn't show yet.
What's the matter?
You in a hurry for the table?
Did I say that?
There's no one here.
You're not losing any tips letting me sit.
It makes no difference to me.
I'm here till 3:00 anyway.
I thought maybe you might want to order.
It's getting late,
Mr. Bauer.
He said he'd come.
I thought you'd never come.
My car was put away.
I had to find a taxi.
I'm glad you called me, Freddy.
I'm glad you thought it over,
And to listen to me.
To calm down and listen to me
So I can help you.
Coffee.
I know how bad you feel, Freddy.
It was a wicked, foolish thing to do
To put a gun in my brother's hand
For him to kill you.
That's what you wanted to do.
That's what it was.
I know how it feels to try to find someone
To kill you, to finish you off,
To take the crimes of your life
On his head, in his hands.
Please, Mr. Morse, all I want is to quit.
That's all.
Nothing else.
They won't let me quit, and I want to quit.
I'll die if I don't quit.
I'm a man with heart trouble.
I die almost every day myself.
That's the way I live.
It's a silly habit.
You know, sometimes you feel
As though you're dying
Here... and here.
Here... you're dying while you're breathing.
Freddy, what have you done?
Freddy, what have you done to me?
Take it easy, pop.
You won't get hurt.
You're coming with us, pop. Come on!
You can't take all night.
Stand up and walk!
Stop him! Stop him!
He knows me!
Kill him! Kill him!
He knows me!
Joe, I’m not going to eat
If you don't eat.
Come on, now.
Eat something.
You'll feel better.
I'm eating, and I feel better.
Why don't you do something
That's good for yourself?
Why don't you stop drinking and eat,
Or why don't you go home?
Just why don't you do something-
Hey!
Tell them to play louder.
I have something private to tell the lady.
Yes, Mr. Morse.
It's true.
It's something private,
And I don't want the whole world to hear.
I don't want the whole world to know what you know-
That hall, link hall, my partner's friend,
Is going to take my life away in the morning.
Why are we sitting here, then?
If it's so serious,
If it's so bad, what are you doing here
Getting drunk and talking so crazy?
I'm celebrating.
I'm celebrating.
It's a holiday.
A holiday is when you celebrate something
That's all finished up,
That happened a long time ago,
And now there's nothing left to celebrate but the dead.
You talk as if you were dead.
That's what I am-
Dead, disbarred, done for, finished, kaput.
When did this happen, Joe?
The day I was born.
And I’m sorry for you, that I got you into this-
A girl with advantages trying to make a living.
But I was a man,
A boy with advantages trying to make a living.
Let's dance.
Oh, Joe!
Oh, Joe, I want to help you,
If you'll be serious.
I'm serious.
Joe, please-
Don't be afraid.
You don't know what it is to have real fear in you.
You don't know what it is
To wake up in the morning and go to sleep at night
And eat your lunch and read the papers
And hear the horns blowing in the streets
And the horns blowing in the clubs,
And all the time, wherever you are,
Whatever you're doing, whatever you're seeing,
Wherever you are, you're afraid in your heart.
Is that what life is?
Joe!
Play louder.
Go on, play.
Is that what life is?
Joe, you didn't know what was right for you.
A person has to know what's right for them
And do it, no matter what.
I took a risk to make a million.
Wasn't that right for me?
I lost, but hall is wrong
If he thinks I’m gonna spend the rest of my life in jail.
I'm leaving, Doris.
I'm running away with a pocketful of money.
You want to come?
The money is for you, too, if you want it.
Oh, Joe,
I don't want this money.
Nobody wants it.
I want somehow to get you, Joe,
To save you for yourself and myself.
Somehow you're wild and crazy
And stuck in a trap,
And somehow you won't fight to get out... and somehow I love you.
Thanks.
Sam.
Joe!
You make up your mind yet, Ficco?
I'm thinking it over, Ben.
It's only going to be one way, Ficco,
And no other.
You took that gun of yours and jazzed up the town.
You killed one man,
And you kidnapped another.
I was on the outside, Ben, with a gun and broke.
You was on the inside,
With the money and the organization.
I wanted in.
All right,
I’m taking you in
On my terms, Ficco, not yours.
Any way you say, Ben, as long as I’m in.
All right.
Here's the situation.
All the legal Charlies
From the corner cop up to hall and the governor
Are going to be screaming for action
After what you did tonight.
They'll raid my banks up and down the line,
Night and day,
And everybody working for me
Is going to want to quit.
I want you to take your boys
And hold those people in line.
Do what you have to do, go as far as you have to go.
No matter how tough hall gets,
Those banks are going to operate.
I want that money coming in, no matter what,
And nobody quits.
Understand?
Not even the janitor.
It's a deal, Ben.
Phone's no good to us.
Hall's got it tapped.
It's a direct wire
Right to the special prosecutor's office.
And another thing, Ficco-
No phones.
Nobody talks over the phone about anything.
Everything is tapped right down to hall.
You'll get in touch with me through Joe Morse.
You'll report to him personally
Every day, everything.
He'll know where I am.
I don't think I can do business with Joe Morse.
What do you need him in this for anyway, Ben?
Blow him off.
Get rid of him.
He won't be worth a dime when the going gets tough.
These shysters scare easy.
Besides, he won't want to do business with me
On account of his brother.
I'll handle him.
You just turn his brother loose.
I'll take care of Joe.
We got a problem there, Ben.
Joe! Are you crazy?
Are you crazy, coming here like this
In the middle of the night?
Tucker: I’ve been waiting for you all night, Joe.
Where have you been?
Where's my brother, Ben?
Where's my brother?
Where's my brother?
Where's Ficco?
Where did Ficco take my brother?
This is Ficco. I made all my arrangements, Joe.
He's coming in with us
To help us hide this mess from hall's glory boys.
Joe!
Tucker: settle down.
I've had enough of you, Joe.
I've had a bellyful of you and your brother.
Right from the beginning.
Where's my brother?
I'm running this combination,
And you're working for me,
Just like Ficco.
Is that straight?
I'll have Ficco turn your brother loose
In the morning.
And you see to it
That he keeps his mouth shut
When hall works him over.
Leo Morse won't talk.
He's dead.
Why didn't you tell me?
You weren't interested.
Where is he?
I had him dumped on the rocks
Near the river by the lighthouse
Under the bridge.
Tucker: we'll let him stay there.
I tell you what, Ficco.
I'll take Joe out of town for a while.
I don't want him here
When the police find his brother's body.
Ficco: why don't you leave town alone, Ben?
Morse ain't no good for the combination.
Sure. Ficco is better for the combination.
He's a killer.
He wants to kill me.
Don't you, Ficco?
Ficco:
I will!
Like you had Bauer killed.
Like Bauer!
Like my brother.
Yeah, like your brother!
Tucker: shut up, Joe.
I'll give it to you straight, Ben.
I'm not going to my own funeral.
You're no better than Ficco.
You were a gunman and a killer before we became partners,
And I showed you
How to hide your business from the police.
Now you're going back to your old trade.
You made a deal with Ficco to run the racket with a gun,
And I’m in the way.
Is that it?
You killed before, and now you want to kill again.
But I’m not going to end up
On the rocks in the river like my brother.
I'll walk out of here alive to hang the both of you.
This is Joe Morse.
Tell Mr. Hall and the police
I'll be down to see them in an hour.
Doris was waiting for me downstairs,
And we left before the police came.
I wanted to find Leo, to see him once more.
It was morning by then, dawn,
And naturally
I was feeling very bad there
As I went down there.
I just kept going down and down there.
It was like going down to the bottom of the world
To find my brother.
I found my brother's body at the bottom there,
Where they had thrown it away on the rocks by the river,
Like an old, dirty rag nobody wants.
He was dead,
And I felt
I had killed him.
I turned back to give myself up to hall,
Because if a man's life can be lived so long
And come out this way-
Like rubbish-
Then something was horrible
And had to be ended one way or another,
And I decided to help.
What is it?
Cheetah must be seeing things.
What is it, Tarzan?
What is it?
Strange sound in sky.
Big. Far off.
- I don't hear anything.
- Tarzan hear.
- Cheetah hear. Elephants hear.
- I hear it.
- It's like a great wind coming.
- There!
Sounds like it's going to land.
White men no longer make safari.
Come through sky like vultures.
- Tarzan send men away.
- We'll see it.
Boy stay.
Tarzan's right, darling.
You better come with me.
Why doesn't Tarzan want strangers on the escarpment, Mother?
Because he loves us and wants to protect us.
When strangers come from outside, they always cause trouble.
They're always seeking something.
- Something? But what, Mother?
- Well, for instance, gold.
There's lots of yellow stones in the river.
Tarzan says he doesn't want them.
But when they find them, they lose their reason.
They do terrible things.
They even destroy each other.
Cheetah! Now, stop that at once!
Well, it serves you right.
What's the matter?
Escarpment, juju, bwana.
Escarpment taboo.
Escarpment taboo, your grandmother.
Tell your pals we're here to trap lions.
We'll get them.
Place kind of gives me the willies too, Buck.
Queer, wasn't it? The way it suddenly shot up above the clouds?
Another couple of feet, we'd smack right into it.
- Still looks like Africa to me.
- I know, but try and find it on the map.
Gentlemen! We're in luck.
The place is alive with lions!
- Tracks everywhere!
- Good.
I figured those were lions
I saw from the air.
Bwana, juju-man come.
Tarzan!
The ape-man they talked about back at the settlement.
Then it's true, he's not a myth.
- Hey! What's the idea?
- Gun no good!
- Men go!
- Wait a minute!
- You think you run Africa?
- Take it easy, Buck.
This is his neck of the woods.
Now, gentlemen, gentlemen, we're forgetting.
I think introductions are in order.
My name is Manchester Mountford, the world-famous animal trainer.
This is Mr. Jimmie Shields, our pilot.
This gentleman is Mr. Buck Rand, well-known hunter and animal man.
See, we've come from America to fetch lions.
- Men go!
- Oh, we can't very well right now.
It'll be dark. I don't fly through strange country at night.
We'll have to wait until morning.
Tomorrow sun make new safari.
When shadow come between sticks, men go!
I suppose he means when the tall stick's shadow pulls back to the short stick.
All right, get back to work.
Be finished in just a minute, Cheetah.
There, finished.
I think Tarzan would like some plums for breakfast.
- That's pretty.
- For Boy. Spear fish.
It's a good idea. He'll love it.
It'll take his mind off the aeroplane.
Thank you, Cheetah.
Oh, those are nice plums.
Tarzan, what were those men like?
One man bad. Other man funny.
- And the third man, what was he like?
- Third man make iron bird fly.
Maybe good. Understand Tarzan.
Oh, I won't be happy until I see that plane flying away in the morning.
Look!
Did you see my airplane?
Did you? Did you see it fly?
Looks like the airplane we saw.
Boy, look what Tarzan has made you.
For Boy. Spear fish.
- Where're we going? The jungle?
- No. Down mountain. Big waterfall.
If we went in the jungle, we might see the airplane.
- Just pass by, I mean.
- Airplane leave with sun.
- It won't leave during the night?
- No, darling.
This is strange country.
They wouldn't fly at night.
Sure?
- Boy sleep now. Spear fish tomorrow.
- All right, Tarzan. Good night.
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, darling.
I wish I could get just one look at the airplane.
Maybe I could make one like it myself.
Boy see plane when new sun climb mountain.
- Did you change your mind?
- Boy see plane. In sky.
That's right. He'll see it when it takes off. I hadn't thought of that.
- I hope he won't be too disappointed.
- Boy forget plane soon.
Maybe.
Tarzan know. Tarzan catch giant bird.
Train bird. Boy fly.
Good heavens, no! I don't want him hurtling through the sky on a bird's neck.
- He's daring enough as it is.
- Boy little Tarzan.
And I want him to grow up to be a big Tarzan.
- Tarzan watch Boy.
- I know you will. I shouldn't worry.
I know there's never a need to worry as long as you're with me.
At first I used to have so many little fears for myself, for Boy.
But one by one, you chased them away.
Wouldn't it be strange if someday
I became as brave as you are?
Jane no need to be brave.
Jane beautiful. Jane good.
You're my goodness, darling.
My strength.
Jane, Tarzan. Tarzan, Jane.
Come on. Cut out the monkeyshines.
Get those crates aboard.
Load them on the other side.
- What're you doing? Starting trouble?
- No, just trying to avoid it.
I'd say we've got a half an hour.
We've got until the last trap's loaded, and we don't go before.
Now, gentlemen, perhaps we could sit down with Mr. Tarzan and talk it over.
- A white boy?
- Here? A phenomenon.
He rides that bull like an old-timer.
It's big, isn't it?
How's it fly? Like a bird?
No, sonny. The wings don't move. That blade there going around does the trick.
You mean that big fan?
It makes it fly?
Say, young fella, where'd you come from?
I live here with Tarzan and Jane.
- Did Tarzan send you here?
- No, sir, he didn't. I came by myself.
- Could this carry an elephant like Simba?
- It might if you could get him aboard.
- You got those elephants trained?
- They do what I tell them.
- Truly a phenomenon!
- A natural.
- What makes the fan go?
- What else can the elephants do?
You're the man who drives the plane.
- I'm the pilot. How'd you figure it out?
- You look like you like the sky.
Well, thanks, sonny.
- Say, that's okay.
- Reminds me of one of my old acts.
- Can I go inside?
- Sure you can.
Wait, they know any more tricks?
Yes, sir. They can do almost anything
I ask them to.
Steady now, Buli. Buli, I won't hurt you.
Stay still.
There.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
That kid would be a sensation in a circus.
I can see the 24-sheets now.
The boy-king of the jungle!
He'd be a gold mine if we had him back in America.
I get it. Now that you've got the lions for Sargent's mangy circus...
...you figure on snatching the boy too.
- You're wonderful, sonny.
- Now may I go inside?
You sure can. Listen, sonny boy, as soon as we get these crates aboard...
...we'll take you for a ride.
- I can ride?
Lay off, Buck! Go on home.
Take your animals and go home.
- I promised the kid a ride, didn't I?
- Not with me at the stick, you didn't.
Now, do what I say, sonny, get going!
- He'd be a headliner under the big top.
- The chance of a lifetime.
- You got religion suddenly, didn't you?
- I like to stay on the beam when I can.
It works out better all around.
- That shadow's getting pretty close.
- I'll worry about that shadow.
I would, if I were you.
Better check that last trap, Mountie.
We'll get out of here.
Two. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on. Get these crates aboard and get that tent down.
Lion tracks.
Come back here, boy.
Boy, let this net down. Come here.
Watch yourself!
Get on. Watch it, sonny.
- Bwana, bwana, lions! Lions!
- Mountford man, caught in trap!
- Thanks. You came just in time.
- All right, sonny.
Buck, it was wonderful. You should've seen that little laddie charge that lion...
...just as he was to rip me to ribbons.
- He did?
- So you're a lion man too?
- Sonny, I owe you my life.
The Jaconi.
- Boy! Tarzan go!
- I'm going too.
Tarzan! Tarzan's coming!
Tarzan!
Let me go! Let me go!
The fire will burn them to a crisp.
The wind's blowing in that direction
No use, sonny.
You've got to come with us.
- I wanna go to Tarzan.
- You can't get through.
Come on, Mountie, head for the plane.
What's he doing here?
Jaconi got his father and mother, killed them, set fire to them.
Jane. Jane. Jane!
Tarzan...
...what is it?
What's Cheetah saying?
- Cheetah say Boy gone in iron bird.
- The hunters took him?
Cheetah say yes.
Oh, Tarzan, they'll take him away.
They'll take him across the sea.
- Jane, be brave.
- Oh, darling, whatever will we do?
Our whole world's gone.
Tarzan find Boy.
Big place. Find Boy.
Tarzan, wait.
You trust me, darling, don't you?
Tarzan always trust Jane.
If it were for any reason less than our Boy, I'd make you turn back.
We're going into places where men's minds are more tangled...
...than the worst underbrush in the jungle, and I'm afraid.
More afraid than I've ever been in my life.
Everywhere we'll be met with lies and deceit.
Your honesty and directness will only be handicaps.
It'd break my heart to see your strength caught in the quicksands of civilization.
And I'll be the only guide you'll have.
Will you follow me?
Will you do as I say?
I'll try not to fail you.
Jane lead way.
Tarzan follow always.
- Tarzan.
- Gun!
Tarzan sorry.
This must be the plane. Cargo of wild animals, three men and a boy.
- Boy!
- Tarzan.
The plane was cleared by pilot
Jimmie Shields for New York.
- Jimmie Shields?
- That's correct, sir.
- I'm sorry I haven't more information.
- Oh, you've been very kind.
- But now we must find our Boy.
- Come. We go to New York quick.
- Is it possible to charter a plane?
- No, I'm afraid not.
But our regular mail plane connects with a clipper for America.
That's due in tomorrow morning.
I can arrange for you to have a passage on that.
- But it'll cost an awful lot of money.
- We'll pay anything.
Shouldn't this be enough?
Oh, that's more than plenty.
But I doubt our local bank will be able...
...to convert these gold nuggets into currency.
- Still, I'll arrange letters of credit for you.
- Oh, I wish you would.
Thank you for all your kindness.
Oh, there's just one more detail, madam.
Our local Chinese tailor carries ladies' and gentlemen's apparel.
Not exactly Paris models or Bond Street suits.
We do need some clothes.
We better go, darling.
We'll be very busy between now and tomorrow morning.
Good man. Tarzan thank.
Oh, not at all, sir.
I hope you find your boy all right.
Bigger suit, you try on.
This is last one. Careful, please.
Three pounds, please. No can do.
No more jackets.
But we're leaving tomorrow, and we must have clothes.
- Can't you make some?
- Take time, missy.
Well, I'll triple the price.
I try.
- Suit ready, missy. This way please.
- Very well. Tarzan, you must stay.
The tailor has to measure you. Sorry, but we must get clothes to go to New York.
- Jane get clothes. Tarzan better without.
- Now, darling, you promised.
Cheetah, you behave yourself.
You look wonderful, darling.
Scratch. No good.
Take off. Put on in New York.
No, no, no, you've got to get used to it.
There.
- Thank you so much.
- Missy pleased, Sun Lee pleased.
Cheetah, come.
Well, where is she?
Stone jungle.
Yes, a man-made jungle.
- Natives live there?
- Yes, they live and they work there.
- Why?
- To help them concentrate their efforts.
- Get things done in a hurry. Save time.
- Save time? Why?
Darling, you're asking me a question all the sages haven't been able to answer.
We're going down.
We're going to land.
Now, these are 30-day permits.
- You understand, lady, don't you?
- Yes.
Mike, call up the pilot's room. See if they know where Jimmie Shields is.
He's in Alaska by now or the South Pole, that is if he has the price of the gas.
Right over there, please.
There are some routine things to attend to, like fingerprinting, just routine.
- Come, Tarzan.
- Hurry. Find Boy.
You must be patient, darling.
We're almost finished.
Cheetah. Now, Cheetah, stop it.
- Sorry, she gets playful sometimes.
- Cheetah thirsty.
Here's where Shields stays, the Gloucester Hotel.
- I'm very grateful.
- Sure.
- Find Boy!
- We will...
...since we know where the pilot lives.
Go! Go. Cheetah!
- Taxi?
- Yes, please.
- House on wheels?
- It's called a taxicab, dear.
Taxicab?
Don't worry! It'll hold together!
Open the door, darling. Thank you.
Gloucester Hotel, please.
Cheetah, you'd better sit over here, dear.
I hope that monkey's tame.
You don't need to worry.
She's quite friendly.
Just so long as she knows it.
Man know trail?
Of course, darling.
Taxi drivers know the city.
- Like Tarzan know jungle.
- Yes, like Tarzan know jungle.
- War dance. Where natives?
- There're no natives. That's music.
It comes out of that little box.
It's called a radio.
Radio?
Woman sick. Cry for witch doctor.
You should be a critic, darling.
There. How's that?
Good. Now radio good.
I don't like it. I don't like it.
Jasper, grab these bags.
Jaconi tribe. Put clothes on him too.
Oh, darling.
- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you, ma'am.
Thank you. Come, Tarzan.
Why, good afternoon.
Good afternoon. We'd like to see
Mr. Jimmie Shields, please.
I'm sorry, but Mr. Shields isn't in now.
As a matter of fact, he hasn't been here for several days.
Did he have a little boy staying with him?
A cute little boy, sun-brown curly hair?
- Why, no madam.
- Where Boy?
I don't know. All I know is he didn't bring any boy here.
- Where Shields now?
- That's anybody's guess.
He'll probably turn up in a day or two.
He usually does.
You'll have him contact us when he gets back?
- Yes, madam.
- I think we'd better take a suite.
Yes, madam, but what about the gorilla?
Cheetah? She's part of the family.
- She'll be all right, I promise you.
- Very well, madam.
Cheetah, thank the kind gentleman for letting you stay.
- Hey, what is this?
- Cheetah say thank you.
Take him away!
- Better sit down, dear.
- Follow me, please.
Thank you.
It's all right, boys.
She's just like one of the family.
- Anything else?
- No, thank you.
Thanks, lady.
- Are you looking for Jimmie Shields?
- Yes, we are.
The minute he gets back from a trip...
...he heads straight for the Club
Moonbeam. His girlfriend sings there.
I don't know her name, but she may put you wise to when he'll be back.
The Club Moonbeam. Thank you.
Find Shields, then we get Boy.
- Cheetah say we go now.
- Cheetah must be patient too.
- Patient?
- Yes, darling.
- All right. Jane be boss here.
- Thank you.
Hello. Would you get me the Club Moonbeam, please?
- Why Jane talk to that?
- It's a telephone.
To talk a long way, you talk into this.
Telephone good.
Telephone say where Boy is?
Oh, I hope so.
Hello, Club Moonbeam?
Yes, ma'am, this am the Club Moonbeam.
No, ma'am.
Ain't nobody around here.
- That's excepting me.
- Well, when will someone be there?
Well, maybe 9:00 tonight.
And that's early.
Well, then I suppose there's nothing we can do except wait.
- Thank you.
- What telephone say?
Not yet, darling.
We have to wait until it's dark.
Oh, Tarzan, I'm just as impatient as you are, but there's nothing we can do now.
Come on, let's go and unpack.
- When dark come, find Boy?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, I thought you got your number. Just a moment, please.
Hello. Hello.
What's that?
This is Sam. Who is this?
What's that?
I said, this is Sam. That's what I said.
What'd you say?
You ain't getting fresh with me, is you, colored boy?
Don't give me none of that double talk!
Hear me?
Why, you... You... You mush-mouth!
Now what?
Cheetah, what are you doing?
Now, you give me that telephone right away.
Yes. Don't you dare touch that anymore. The idea!
Good heavens, what's that?
- Tarzan!
- Big rain good!
Look at your clothes! Come on out and take those wet things off.
Oh, feel good.
You can't look for Boy with wet clothes on.
- Why?
- Just isn't done, that's all.
Come on out. I'll call the valet.
You get these wet things off.
Oh, Cheetah, my things.
How could you?
There. Now we're all ready to go.
Cheetah wants help find Boy.
I think it will be better if Cheetah stays right here.
And, Cheetah, you remember no more beauty treatments.
Cheetah.
Smells like Swahili swamp.
Why people stay?
It's called "a good time."
Good evening.
Have you reservations?
We're not staying. We're looking for a friend, Jimmie Shields.
Oh, yes, Mr. Shields isn't here.
Hasn't come in yet.
- Mr. Shields' friend?
- Yes.
- Wanna talk to you.
- Beat it, halfback.
- Break it up.
- Tarzan, don't. She's singing.
- Come on.
- Talk now. You Jimmie's friend?
- Just a minute.
- Hold it, Eddie.
As marvelous as I am,
I can't do two things at once...
...and do them good, so excuse me a split second.
- What's wrong with Jimmie, a crackup?
- No, we're looking for him.
- We want to talk to him.
- I'm Tarzan.
Tarzan?
Fill in with the "Dance of the Hours" for 10 minutes, will you, boys?
When Jimmie gets back from Boston tonight, he'll tell the whole story.
I see. According to the law, someone had to post a bond for $5000...
...with immigration authorities before Boy entered the country.
They tried to raise the money, but they couldn't.
- Tarzan understand.
- This circus man, Sargent...
...posted the bond, and has Boy.
He's at Boundbrook,
Long Island at a circus.
- The show will be out in a half-hour.
- You've been too kind.
Forget it, honey.
Never a cover charge.
Jimmie'll call me, and I'll tell him you're here.
Meanwhile, watch out for Sargent.
He works fast.
- Tarzan get Boy.
- I'll gamble on that.
Cheetah!
Cheetah! Cheetah, how could you?
Cheetah!
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- Thank you.
- We go now.
Good idea, before someone begins hollering for the gendarmes.
- I'm awfully sorry.
- Thanks. Come again.
Get out there as soon as you can.
Good luck.
- That's my hat!
- It ought to fit you now.
What is that?
Elephant language?
Yes. Tarzan taught me.
I was telling Allie...
...about the baby elephants in the jungle.
The fun we used to have together. She'd like to go back and play with them.
I told Allie I wish we could go back together.
It's a pity we ever took you away...
...to troupe under a piece of canvas with thugs like Sargent and Buck.
Mr. Mountford, a lot of times
I've been gonna run away.
Go back to the jungle.
It doesn't make much difference where I go anymore.
Were you telling her about Tarzan?
I told her there wouldn't be fun in the jungle without Tarzan.
She's heard about him.
All the elephants have.
They'd know Tarzan if he came here and spoke to them.
Your father was a great man, wasn't he?
Yes, Mr. Mountford.
He wasn't like men here in civilization.
He was big and alive, like the jungle.
Mr. Mountford, at noon, sometimes when I go for a walk...
...I look up at a skyscraper. Sometimes
I think Tarzan's up there too...
...in the clouds, just like he was in the escarpment.
Gee, the fun we used to have.
- Why's Pinkus out of his cage?
- I was playing with him.
Did I tell you to stop taking the animals out?
- Yes.
- Well, put him back.
- Please, Mr. Buck.
- Pinkus wasn't hurting anybody.
Cut out the slobbering and put him back.
- Kid, where you going?
- I've got cablegram for Mr. Sargent.
I'll take it.
We're due to fold in a couple of days if this keeps up.
Less than $400 in the house tonight.
Here, maybe this will solve our problems.
- Sawdust and spangles!
- It's from the Matson Show.
From Tim Matson. Listen to this.
"Will give you $ 100,000 for Boy and all rights to his act."
A hundred grand. Say, that's the softest take we've had in quite a while.
"Meet show in Rio de Janeiro on the 10th. You can make it...
...by South American clipper if you leave on the sixth. Regards, Tim Matson."
This is the fourth. That gives us two days to get money for the tickets.
We should clear that much if we stall payroll tomorrow night.
Then the kid's their worry, not ours.
- How's the kid tonight?
- All right.
- He's pretty good around Mountie.
- Keep him happy.
- He means a lot to us.
- Leave it to me, colonel.
Cheetah, stay!
- Tarzan.
- What's that?
Over there.
Quick. Get the kid off the lot while I stall him.
- Say, mister.
- Yeah?
- Where is Mr. Sargent?
- In that red wagon.
- In here?
- Yeah.
- Where Boy?
- Boy? What boy?
Our son.
He's here. We've come for him.
If you've lost your son, I'm sorry, but why pick on me?
- Tell truth.
- Don't come closer.
Darling, please.
Remember, Tarzan...
...you promised to do as I asked.
- Your wife is a sensible woman.
- You don't mind going now...
- Mr. Sargent, it's no use evading things.
We know you have Boy because you posted an immigration bond for him.
Boy here.
- Tarzan!
- Hey, Jack.
Gather the boys at the red wagon.
- Right.
- Go ahead.
- Satisfied?
- No.
- Tarzan not go till we find Boy!
- You're going right now.
There's no Boy around here, and I'm tired trying to convince you.
What does that mean?
Now find Boy.
All right, break it up.
Spread out, men.
Come on. Spread out, boys.
Tarzan!
Don't worry. I brought the cops along in case, knowing Mr. Sargent as I do.
It looks like you guessed right.
Come on now, boys, clear out.
- Now we get Boy.
- Why, yes. What about that boy?
- This man's taken him.
- What about it?
Here, this will explain.
This is a receipt for a bond from U.S. Immigration.
It gives Sargent temporary custody of a nameless boy, parents dead.
- Tarzan's Boy!
- Now, Tarzan, it can't be settled here.
You could level the show, and you'd never find him.
There's only one way to get him back, the law.
He's right.
You'd only find trouble here.
We'd better trust the law.
- Ask law, get Boy back.
- Yes.
We'll go to court.
It won't take long.
- And I'll get you a lawyer.
- Lawyer? What's lawyer?
To help to get Boy back.
Tarzan wait. Tarzan see!
Get Boy back. Cheetah.
- Thanks, Chuck.
- Okay.
The affidavits show that Boy was taken from the jungle...
...a spot in the Congo known as "the escarpment"...
...where he lived with my clients.
He was taken by Mr. Sargent's agent, brought here...
...where Mr. Sargent posted an immigration bond for him...
...and instituted adoption proceedings.
Your client opposes the return of the boy to his parents?
- Yes.
- On what grounds?
The jungle isn't a home for him.
He's filed adoption papers.
Naturally, we will oppose any move to adopt this boy.
I have more expert witnesses on jungle life...
...if Your Honor will permit.
- All right.
- Take the stand, Tarzan.
Tarzan, sit in that chair.
Hand on the book.
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- Tarzan always tell truth.
- What's your name?
- Tarzan.
- Full name?
That's the only name he has.
You have educated your son, haven't you?
I mean, well, what did you teach the boy?
Teach Boy where to find water when thirsty, where to find food when hungry.
Tarzan teach Boy to be strong like lion and happy like bird.
You find everything you need in the jungle, do you?
Wise men need little.
Have you thought what would become of Boy if he grows up in the jungle?
Boy grow up to be brother of sun and friend of rain.
Hurt nobody.
Want nothing people have.
Grow old like cedar tree.
Boy will be good man, happy man.
No one can want more than that.
That's all, thank you.
- Can you read, Tarzan?
- Read?
Yes, read. Read a book.
Ever hear of Shakespeare's Hamlet?
Tarzan read trails in jungle.
Read clouds in sky.
- Lawyer ever hear of kinsin-nupa?
- Kinsin- what?
Kinsin-nupa. Cure snakebites.
All babies in the jungle know that.
- This is a court of law.
- White man's law lots of words.
Jungle law more easy.
Man live own life.
So you prefer the jungle code to civilized law?
In jungle, men only kill bad animals.
In civilization, men kill good men.
Will Mr. Norton concede human life is in constant peril...
...in this wild region from which this child was rescued?
No, I will not concede any such thing.
In the last year, 35,000 men, women and children were killed...
...in auto accidents alone in this country.
I object. Counsel's remarks are immaterial.
Objection denied.
Proceed, Mr. Beaton.
- If the court please...
- Yes.
I submit, Your Honor...
...the jungle is not an issue in this case.
The only issue is guardianship.
Are these two people morally fit to bring up an adolescent to proper manhood?
It is my contention that they are.
By his conduct in this court,
Tarzan has proved himself no savage...
...but rather uniquely civilized.
You may resume cross-examining the witness.
No more questions.
Your Honor, I'd like to place my last witness on the stand.
Very well.
By the way, Tarzan, how's fishing on this escarpment of yours?
- Big fish.
- How big?
Lipamani, so big.
Malagani fish, so big.
Is that so?
As a civilized fisherman...
...I would have stretched the truth at least a foot.
Jane is right. Law good.
Give Boy back.
Soon, dear.
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Before going to the jungle, you lived a long while in civilization?
- Yes, in London.
- Did you like it?
I had everything money could buy.
In comparison, how do you like the jungle?
There is no comparison.
I wouldn't live anywhere else.
Is it a good place to raise a son?
It teaches him most things he needs to know...
...how to live simply, naturally, happily.
You say that as a mother, with a mother's instinct and wisdom?
A mother would never wrong her own son.
Thank you, madam. Your witness.
Tell me what you do in the jungle...
...when you need a doctor?
- We seldom do.
But if we do, we have our own drug store too.
Many modern drugs were known and used in the jungle centuries before here.
Digitalis, for example, and quinine, tannic acid, alum.
- Dozens more.
- Has your boy ever been ill?
- No. He grew up healthy and strong.
- Like the other savage animals?
- He's not a savage animal.
- Like animals...
...he was born and raised in the jungle.
- He was not born in the jungle!
Your boy was not born in the jungle?
Where was he born?
- I don't know.
- Well, you're his mother, aren't you?
I prefer not to answer that question.
You'll have to answer, madam.
Remember, you're under oath.
Tell this court, are you the mother of this child? Yes or no?
We found him, Tarzan and I, after an airplane crash in the jungle.
Yes or no?
His parents were killed.
Tarzan and I are the only parents he's ever known.
You came into this court with unclean hands.
You led this court to believe you were the parents...
...when you had no legal claim to him whatever! You lied!
- I did not!
- And he lied!
You steal Boy from me!
Tarzan, stop it! Let go!
Let go! Darling, Tarzan!
Take a look, Your Honor!
He's a man who claims to be a fit guardian for a child. He's a savage!
This hearing is adjourned until tomorrow.
Detain him in the waiting room.
I'll take up the matter of this disturbance later.
Come on.
- What a break.
- You said it.
Let's grab the kid and make that plane.
You were right, Tarzan, as you always are...
...and I was wrong.
I asked you to trust the law...
...and you did. And now...
Listen to me, darling.
I know that man's laws are not for you.
You who are as free as an eagle.
I should've told you to follow your own law.
To find Boy in your own way.
I said this was my jungle.
I was wrong.
Your jungle is my jungle.
I know that now.
- I only hope it's not too late.
- Too late?
I hope not. I hope not.
- Jane say go?
- Yes, darling.
Tarzan go. Tarzan get Boy.
Come back! You'll break your neck!
The roof! Quick!
Hey!
Tarzan just escaped from court.
He's in a Globe taxicab believed headed for the circus on Long Island.
Stop all Globe cabs crossing the bridge.
They're after Tarzan, who's in the papers.
Follow that cab that just went by and see who's inside.
- What's that noise?
- That's the law, mister.
Law? Quick! Circus, hurry!
- Didn't you hear that siren?
- Yes.
Come down before you break your fool neck.
Look, fella, it's no use trying!
Give it up!
Tarzan.
- Make them come and get you!
- Keep climbing!
Good luck, old boy!
Maybe we'd better go.
- I'm not afraid.
- That's a 200-foot dive.
He can't make it and live.
- Boy, what nerve!
- We'd better take you home.
- No, we're going to the circus.
- Circus?
- Yes.
- Tarzan will be there. Come on.
Open up, boys.
I'll take him.
Let the lad go!
- Put that gun away!
- It's full of blanks.
Four are, but the fifth one's the getaway, and you know it.
Come on, sonny. Get out of here.
Tarzan'll be here soon.
Stick him in the wagon.
You saw nothing.
- Okay.
- Is he all right?
Come on down out of there, kid, before you get hurt.
Hey! Go up there and get him down.
Come on, hurry up!
Get up there! Get up!
Look out! He's gonna swing!
- Get him.
- Get up there. Climb that ladder.
Go on! Hurry up, Pete!
Come on down, son.
You can't get away.
Tarzan! Tarzan! Here I am!
Tarzan! Here I am!
Let him come down. I'll stop him.
Put that gun away!
We're in enough of a jam as it is.
Get some men over to that other pole!
Get around that net!
Now's your chance, Buck.
Yank out those net poles!
Stay! Boy, stay!
- Coming through!
- Look out!
Take him over to the animal tent.
Put him in a cage.
Right in here. Come on.
Quickly. Go on.
Come on! Get him in there!
All right, you men!
Come on. Hurry up!
Come on. Hurry up!
You better come down now.
- We'll get you sooner or later.
- I won't!
Strike the whole rig.
Get him out of that side there!
Simba!
Simba!
Let him down easy. Easy now.
Easy.
Let me go!
Let me go, I tell you!
I wanna go back to Tarzan!
Let me go!
Let's get going.
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Don't!
Let me go, I tell you.
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Get back!
Look out!
Watch out!
Go through that tent!
Go around the other way!
Tarzan! Boy!
Oh, Boy, darling.
This place isn't any too healthy.
Come on, get in.
Simba!
And I hereby sentence you to 30 days in jail for contempt of court.
I also sentence you to 30 days for resisting an officer.
Both sentences run concurrently.
But taking into consideration the motive which actuated both misdemeanors...
...I hereby suspend sentence.
- Thanks, Your Honor.
Tarzan, you're free.
Law good. Judge good.
Thank you.
Tell me, when is fishing best down your way?
- Fishing always good.
- Then you'll probably be seeing me.
Well, you can fly down with Connie and me on our honeymoon.
- Well, goodbye and good luck.
- Friend.
Court's adjourned.
Swim.
Madagascar.
For centuries the bloodiest cock pit of all the seas.
Where the infamous brotherhood of the damned awaited to plunder the... treasure laden galleons from India and Cathay.
Then returned drunk with slaughter to their pirate stronghold of Last Hope.
Most ruthless of all was Captain William Kidd.
He encountered the great
London galleon the Twelve Apostles...
Commanded by Admiral Lord Blayne... and approaching unsuspected in the guise of a peaceful merchantman... by a sudden treacherous salvo he reduced her to a burning hulk.
When night fell, the Twelve Apostles was only a blazing funeral pyre on the... placid surface of a Madagascar lagoon.
Stab me, there's a pretty sight.
Will be prettier still when the fire reaches the magazine Captain.
Pity though.
Lot of stout seamen among them.
And with us a long time.
We can none of us live forever Mr Boyle, dead men don't talk.
Man your oars, we got this job to do before high tide.
There, and dig faster, the tide catches here it'll save the King's hangman some rope.
There you are, deep enough to bury a man in.
Give us a hand mate.
- All ready Captain.
- Down she goes.
What are you waiting for?
Well Captain, that chest is been in your cabin a longish time.
And we all thought as it would do no harm to open up that chest... and make sure that what was in it then is in it now.
I suppose you remember what was in it.
Aye, I remember an emerald necklace that came off that Portuguese ship, El Vengar.
And all those pearls that we took from the big ship, the Virgin Queen.
I remember a diamond medallion we got from that Moorish galleon off Madagascar.
And could we ever forget that silver casket with the arms of Lord Blayne... that you claimed for yourself after the taking of the Twelve Apostles sir?
Your neck will be stretched as long as your memory one of this days.
Satisfied, gallows meat? Put them back.
Lower away.
Matter?
Wait a minute Captain, there's something else you forgot.
What do you want to now? We got an half an hour before the tide traps us.
May be sir, we all equal in this I take it.
Equal shares, yes.
Well that key then, what you put back in your belt, that goes down with the chest.
Thus we start all clear and no favors.
If some of us don't get back, it'll be that much easier open for them as does.
Question me honor again, would you? And I'll rip you from belly to chime.
Are we such callous rascals that we'd leave a dead comrade... without commending his soul to his new master?
Here lies one who through treachery and avarice... would've placed in jeopardy the lives of honest men.
And here may he lie forever, in the sands of Madagascar.
Rest in peace.
It's time to be out my lads, time to be away.
If a gentleman is a gentleman, he's gentleman, that's all there's to it, sir
I'm one of nature's gentlemen, but I need polish my good man..
If I'm to improve myself...
A gentleman employs the terminology my good man only when addressing lower servants...
- or his inferior sir.
- You see? That's why I need you.
- In my upbringing...
- A gentleman never sucks his teeth sir.
Many a man's social career has been ruined by less sir.
You seem to know your business.
I want the best mind and I can pay for it.
Hundred quid a year.
An infallible mark of the person of quality... is his reluctance to pay his domestics high wages.
- You don't say so.
- Merely a idiosyncrasy of good breeding sir.
Sixty quid a year then?
You realize I've never been on board a ship before sir.
- Oh don't let that frighten you.
- To the contrary.
In fact, since I was a nipper...
I've a rather adventurous inclination towards life on the bounding main.
- It should be quite educational sir.
- You'll learn a lot, no doubt.
- Is it a bargain then?
- Very well, sir.
My hand on it?
Then, it is your proposal, my Lord Bellomont that Captain Kidd... sail to meet our ambassador Lord
Fallsworth and give him safe convoy through the perilous waters of Madagascar.
- May it please Your Majesty.
- Yes.
That need a bold and adventurous man.
Bring in this Captain Kidd while we take the measure of him.
Captain William Kidd.
Your Royal Majesty and other Lords..
Bellomont, is this your roaring killer of Spanish buccaneers?
Nay me Lord, I'm only a peaceful ship-master who must do trade with other ships... without inquiring too closely about their business.
And it was so I fell into the hands of the Twelve Apostles.
- A King's ship turned pirate.
- In Madagascar waters?
I have never been in
Madagascar waters your Grace.
It was off the southern tip of Africa, where
I had gone to trade in elephant's teeth.
- Who commanded her?
- One of your admirals Your Majesty.
- Name of Lord Blayne.
- He did turn pirating.
Sufficiently me Lords, to put fear in honest traders like myself.
And if you are successful in this voyage
Captain, what reward do you expect?
May it please Your Majesty, having forfeited me honor in that I was... forced to strike me colors to a pirate...
I want no reward but to regain it
In the service of Your Majesty.
Unless it be, is it true that Lord Blayne's lands are estreated and his title forfeit.
Yes.
All, well, all I ask is if I lay this renegade nobleman by the heels... is that you honor the humble self with his castle and his lands.
- Is that all you want Captain Kidd?
- Not a farthing more Your Majesty.
The fellow treats of a title so lightly he must be bursting with noble blood.
Though I confess he keeps it well hid.
Aye sir, you can no more judge of a man by his appearance... than you can judge the extent of a nobleman's brains by the expensiveness of his wig.
Am I to suppose that the Captain of the
King's Guard would deign to fence with me.
Come Captain, is your courage less than your wit?
Nay sir, I know nothing of the fence.
You must come at me, quickly as though you'd kill me.
Very well then.
I ask pardon Sire, I've a hot head when roused, I only meant to demonstrate.
And to good purpose Captain.
Your Majesty is satisfied with the Captain of our choosing?
- I can think of none better.
- I thank you sir.
And now Captain... the main mission of your crew will be to meet a great ship.
The Queda merchant, which is sailing from India with vast treasures.
And to give her safe conduct in my name... past the perilous waters of Madagascar.
But Your Majesty, will her commander accept me letter of mark as sufficient authority to.
You shall have a letter to our ambassador
Lord Fallsworth who's returning in her.
That he is to accept your protection.
And to submit to all matters pertaining to the safety of the ship.
- And her treasures Sire.
- Oh yes.
- And now Sire, me crew...
- Your crew?
Captain Kidd who wishes to recruit a crew from the pirates... now under capital sentence in Newgate and the Marshal sea.
- A crew of condemned pirates?
- Aye Sire.
There's none would be so loyal nor fight so desperately... as cutthroats under sentence of death...
If they knew that at the end of the voyage... a Royal pardon would be in their pockets.
But I shall hold you accountable for their good conduct.
Between their conduct and mine Your
Majesty, there will be little to choose.
And now goodbye.
- And God speed you.
- I am but his unworthy sparrow.
I'd rather eat the bilge slime from an African slaver.
Oh Adam, don't let your temper get you the lash again.
If I must hang I'll hang, but I'll go to the gallows with clean guts at least.
Hey you, what kind of stinking maggots meat is this?
Wardens, wardens.
There's that dainty scum Mercy complaining about the taste of the King's bounty again.
- Watch it.
- Bounty?
Bounty me eye.
The King's allowance is thru-pence a day for food not muck from the sewers of Whitechapel.
Making trouble again, hey Mercy?
I'm asking only what a man is legally entitled to.
Here, smell this.
Delicious.
Hear you Guvnor.
What sort of a kingdom is this?
Where a man is condemned before he's heard and starved before they hang him.
Who is that quarrelsome feller?
Adam Mercy, he is taken in a pirate ship by his Majesty's frigate Wasp.
He's always escaping so that's why we keep him in chains.
He's got a lacing of tiger's blood in him.
This ain't exactly a flower garden, is it?
Oh, forgive me, these are two of me officers Mr Boyle, Guvnor Landers...
Mr Lorenzo, Guvnor Landers.
Spanish blood.
- A pretty lot of sinners.
- Capitán...
Do you think there is anyone down there knows us?
I hope not.
Guvnor, would you be good enough to tell them what we are here for?
Give heed you, you vermin.
Here news to your advantage.
- Is the hangman dead then?
- Out with it then, Jack nasty face.
Is it that your mother's turned into an honest woman?
Silence, you mutinous dogs.
If another man speaks I'll trice him up by the thumbs and flay him raw.
Guvnor, is that the way to win the love of these unfortunate gentlemen?
Now then me bullies, would you rather do the gallows dance... and hang in chains till the crows pick your eyes from your rotting skull... or would you feel the roll of a stout ship beneath your feet again?
I've a vessel, the Adventure galley and the King's commission to sail her.
And for those who show a loyal and a stout heart there's a Royal pardon in the offing.
Which of you knows the waters of Madagascar?
- I do.
- Would you have him unlocked Guvnor?
Warden, unlock him.
Look you then, I want men with iron in their blood and steel in their sinews.
And the first up here is the first enlisted.
Guvnor, if your wardens are ready, would you be good enough to have them lower the ropes.
Lower away.
Here they come, make ready lads.
Put your hands on that,
I'll make you a free man.
The other now.
Next.
Next one, come on.
- Name.
- Philip Shaftstow.
Philip Shaftstow, regardless of the fact that I'm your Captain... you will always address a gentleman as sir scum.
- Aye sir.
- Make your mark.
On board.
- Name.
- Adam Mercy sir.
Oh, so it's you.
Mercy, that's a comical handle for a blade of fortune, Mercy.
It's also something the world needs more of.
A quite and gentle philosopher, you speak cultured.
Were you by any chance a stable boy to a noble house?
Perhaps.
I was also Master Gunner to a buccaneer you may have heard of, Captain Avery.
Avery's Master Gunner?
We needed a Master Gunner
Mr Boyle and from what I've heard...
Avery was a shrewd hand at picking them.
The berth is yours for as long as you can handle it.
I can handle it.
Swivel gun or long arm,
I'll forfeit a guinea for every miss.
You'll forfeit your neck if you miss while you're on my ship. Make your mark.
And you can write.
We'll give you a nice bath, you'll draw a uniform befitting a Master Gunner.
- On board.
- Next man.
- Name.
- Bartholomew Blivens sir.
Bartholomew Blivens, make your mark.
Down below.
- Captain aboard?
- He's over there sir.
Next man.
That's all sir, our complement is full.
- Povey? I thought you...
- Yes, you thought I was dead.
- I can hardly believe my eyes.
- You mean you don't want to believe them.
Now come, come Mr Povey, is that kind or is that fair?
As fair as what you did the day you abandoned me on a Bahama reef.
Oh please Mr Povey, this not the time to talk about that.
Oh, it's the time alright, unless you want me to know.
In which case your present voyage is over before it's begun.
Now, now, now, now, Povey.
Mr Boyle, would you take over, please?
Mr Lorenzo, take the deck watch.
Come to my cabin.
My heart bleeds when I think of one of your... delicate constitution having to fend for yourself on a coral reef Mr Povey.
Come off it Captain.
I know why you marooned me.
You thought there'd be only three of you to share, instead of four.
It's true, a hostile wind did blow us away from your reef.
Between friends, we might've sailed back, it's exactly what you would've done Mr Povey.
So no more of your sentimental nonsense please.
- Now that we are four again, what then?
- We are not four.
We are two, Boyle and Lorenzo, dull clods.
Twenty thousand pounds a piece in their hands would only be spent in sinful ways.
Are you propose to remove them from the path of temptation.
How? A knife in the dark?
I am not a violent man Mr Povey, I detest violence.
People have such an awkward habit of getting in my way.
I'm an ambitious man Mr Povey.
An ambitious man, if he be bold enough, can carve himself a kingdom.
I'm going to be a Lord my friend.
And that for a commoner like myself takes a deal of money.
And that's why there could be two less to share.
- Before we raise old England again?
- You cold-gutted shark.
A flatterer.
Oh, I'm glad you're back in Mr Povey.
You've no idea how gratifying it is to have a congenial soul to confide in.
Thank you.
There's something I want to tell you.
I've left with a trusted friend in London a sealed letter containing an exact... and complete account of certain previous events.
Only to be open in case, just in case of course... you should happen to return to England without me.
Of course my dear fellow, very sensible of you.
Now I know you'll have a happy voyage. I shall too.
I'll look up me quarters.
We are two of the luckiest man alive, just think...
We are sailing for Madagascar waters, we'll pick up the search where we left off.
Every officer on board has a servant.
I'll request the Captain to assign you to me, then we'd be together.
Yes, I've spent a good many years of my life at sea Milady...
But I doubt if any woman minds a dash of salt even in a Peer of the Realm like myself.
Now, if Me Lady would join me in a minuet?
- My Lady sir, not me Lady.
- Blast me Shadwell.
Does one gentleman creep up on another without a cough or a spit or something to warn him?
I'm not a gentleman sir,
I'm a gentleman's gentleman.
Pity about the hair.
I have you've tried everything?
Bear's grease?
Prenatal influence perhaps?
Dinner is served, sir.
- Thank you Shadwell.
- Pardon sir.
I'll show you to your place.
Captain, what's all this mummery?
You can forget your bilge-water manners for the time, Mr Boyle.
You are now officer on a King's ship.
So a man must starve while his manners fatten.
I know, I know.
And in a King's ship it is customary for the officers to rise when the Captain enters.
That's better. Gentlemen be seated.
Well, well, well, what have we here?
- You must not do that sir.
- Of course, but don't press me.
Come Mr Mercy, tell us something about yourself.
You already know whatever's of consequence sir.
While under Avery I was taken by a
King's ship and brought to London.
There I was tried for a pirate and condemned.
You were innocent, of course.
- No sir, I was guilty.
- You speak above your station.
- How came you to go on the account?
- Call it love of adventure... cost in love, scandal, perhaps a mix of all three.
And you've seen something of the world?
Enough sir, to dislike what I've seen and know there's small hope for a better.
Perhaps you prefer the next world Mr Mercy.
You were close enough to it when you were in the condemned hold at Newgate.
But I'm keeping you from your dinner.
And now gentlemen.
A toast to the King and since proposing it is a privilege of the youngest present... the honor falls to Mr Mercy.
- Mr Mercy, we are waiting.
- No sir.
Since I've little love for the King, I'll neither propose his health nor drink it.
Never the less you are on a King's ship.
King's ship or the devil's it's all the same to me sir, I owe him nothing.
You owe him your neck
Mr Mercy, if it were not for his bounty... you'd be dancing daintily on air at Wapping.
I owe my reprieve to you Captain, so to you I'll drink gladly but not to William.
You stand up and drink to his Majesty's health as a King's officer should... or by fire and flame I'll have you shipped back to Newgate on the first vessel we speak.
Gentlemen, the King.
- The King.
- God bless him.
It's curious.
Do you suppose His Majesty put him on board to spy us out?
We've found him chained to a pillar in Newgate.
Wouldn't be to hard for the King to plant him there.
Yes, but why would he speak so openly against the King?
Your wits are even duller than usual Mr Lorenzo.
Have you never heard of the serpent... that takes the color of it's background the better to strike?
- Shadwell...
- Yes sir.
You have a knowledge of high born people and those of the courtship.
- Have you ever seen Mr Mercy before?
- Not before this voyage, sir.
He has as high a spirit as a gentleman of quality, I like him.
Would you find out who he is and where he comes from?
- As you wish sir.
- Thank you Shadwell.
- Foggy night.
- Good evening, Shadwell.
Excuse me sir but you seafaring men always seem to be looking at something... that I never can see...
We are looking for something just over the horizon.
You know sir, I recognized you for a gentleman the moment I saw you sir.
What are you a valet doing at sea?
The Captain employed me to make him socially acceptable sir.
I'm afraid we're too far out for me to swim back.
- If I can be of service to you sir.
- Did the Captain send you here?
- Yes sir.
- Why?
He wants to know who or what you are sir.
Who do they think I am?
Possibly a spy placed on board by His Majesty.
This seemed uneasy sir.
This, this Captain Kidd, how long have you known him? Have you sailed with him before?
Oh, no sir. All I know is, he's a, well, among other things... a merchant captain.
A spy, that's strange.
Why should they be afraid to be spied on?
- Goodnight Shadwell.
- Good night sir.
- Who is he? Where is he from?
- He's a nobody, sir.
He was employed by persons of quality in where he learned his speech and his manners.
It's a matter of judgment.
If you fire on the up-roll, the shot will go over his yardarms.
But if you wait for the down roll, the enemy is coming up. Now watch.
Get ready.
Fire.
Pretty shot Mr Mercy.
Can you do as well with a 74 throwing grape and canister at you?
I've done it sir.
Reload and secure and pick up your practice on the lower quarter swivel gun..
Mr Mercy?
If you sailed with Avery, you must know these waters.
Fairly sir.
If we needed to careen and take on stores, where would you recommend?
Ponticos Bay, it lies...
We draw to much water, you remember Captain...
Remember what?
I only know the Spanish main, these are Madagascar waters.
- Ponticos Bay?
- Aye sir.
Thank you Mr Mercy, come along Mr Boyle.
You blundering ass.
Your presence is becoming increasingly irksome to me, get you below.
Now let's get down to the business of this voyage.
Hand me that chart Mr Boyle.
Capitan, I have been thinking every day and every night.
What about that dinero that was buried in the cave?
What good is it there? Let's get it and get back where we can spend it.
- It stays where it is for a while.
- Why?
We've got a fatter prize sailing right into our pockets.
Now.
Here is our present position, here is Madagascar, here is Calicut.
In June, the great galleon, the Queda Merchant... sails from Calicut to England.
We should meet her about here.
She's stuffed from keel to gunnels with treasure to the value of half million pounds.
Half...?
And we are to give her safe passage through the pirate seas.
By safe passage you mean we are to take her Captain?
No no, don't be greedy Mr Povey,
I grant that most of what's in her may... find it's way into our pockets but let's be fair, the King... poor gentleman, will expect something. But however we do it... must be done legal like and honest.
Stick to ways you are familiar with.
Why, you pox riddled villain I can be as honest as any man if I have the incentive.
Oh yes, me Lord Blayne.
Lord Blayne's name is not be mentioned among us Mr Povey, he's dead, so his crew and so's ours and there's none outside this... cabin that knows what became of them.
And if you all enjoy living, you will remember that.
Well.
Here's to our meeting with the Queda merchant.
- Queda merchant.
- Queda merchant.
- God bless her.
- Dios la bendiga.
Wind fresh from West North-West, sir.
Course Northeast by East, night dark but clear.
Very well, Mr. Mercy.
- North-East by East.
- North-East by East sir.
Missing down, it's Mr Boyle.
Lend a hand men.
Man down.
- What happened?
- He is dead.
If I find the man that's responsible for this, I'll hang him.
Fetch the yard and re-set it.
- What do you suppose happened?
- Someone's been tampering with this lines.
We are gathered together to pit farewell to a gallant seaman and a stout comrade.
Here was a man, shipmates...
Whose heart, the flinty mountains could not match.
Who always took better than he gave.
Whose benevolence was such...
The orphan's might and the rich man's gold alike found refuge in his pocket.
A jealous Providence has removed him from oust.
And I esteem it a privilege to commit his body to the deep.
We shall all mourn him.
Aye, we shall mourn him but take comfort me friends, we shall never see his like again.
Rest in peace. Pop him over.
Pity Mr Mercy, a great pity, but the ship's work must go on.
Move your gear into poor Mr Boyle's cabin, you will take his place as Master.
As Master.
Aye sir.
Why, Shadwell.
Don't tell me after all this time at sea...
My inward revolt is not for the movement of the vessel sir... is occasioned by the company I endure.
The manners I say nothing of sir.
But I am a Dorcestershire man... and when I find a common ship's master is the presumption... to copy himself the coat of arms of one of our best Dorcestershe families... can you wonder if I'm physically upset?
- Whose crest was he copying?
- Credit it or not sir, the Blayne crest.
Are you certain?
Perfectly sir, the crest in on Orange desk's.
Pardon me sir, I must join the captain.
He's inspecting a cask of pickled eels with Mr Lorenzo.
Well, Mr. Mercy.
Do your new duties include robbing my desk?
Shoot me Captain and your head goes with it, I'm here by the King's order.
So he did plant you on board.
You think he let a man sail with a crew of
Newgate cut-throats and not keep tabs on him?
And with good reason,.
If anything ever reaches the Palace this does and murder Captain.
Boyle's death was no accident.
By the way, what ship was sunk here, the Twelve Apostles?
Why the Twelve Apostles Mr Mercy?
Here's Blayne's ring, his name is on it, he commanded the Twelve Apostles.
That will make interesting telling in London when we get back Captain.
- If you get back.
- When I get back, for if I don't...
- On the other hand...
- On the other hand, what?
Since a man doesn't exactly grow rich in the King's pay...
A crooked rogue, so you have your price, how much?
- An equal share in what's buried here.
- Share that with you I'll be hanged if I do.
- You'll be hanged if you don't.
- Of all the slumocky blaggards.
And if you do share, Mr King's informer, what guarantee is there that you won't... still turn evidence to the Crown?
If I go in with you, I am equally guilty.
And if we are caught, we hang together but...
I can keep you from being caught.
What more could you ask?
You know Mr Mercy...
I wondered sometimes if ever I'd meet a more unscrupulous blaggard than myself.
And I have, but let's be sensible about this.
Who knows, we might be useful to each other one day.
In one way or another?
You've forgotten something, the ring.
So I have.
Listen in carefully because I want you to tell it in London if anything happens to me.
Kidd caught me in his cabin robbing his desk.
I lied to him, told him
I was a King's informant.
Good.
Yes but he didn't believe me, not one word, he just pretended to.
Oh, why didn't you shoot him?
Then he would give us no more trouble.
That's a pleasure I'm reserving for later.
He proves the liar I think him.
King's man or no, he betrayed an uncommon interest in the Twelve Apostles.
I didn't like it Mr Lorenzo,
I mean to find out why.
Why, you could've charged him of robbery and turned off to the yardarm and all legal and shipshape.
You would've been rid of him once and for all.
Let's not be impetuous Mr Povey.
He can't leave us, unless he swims.
It'll be rather amusing to find out what he does.
You rest easy, leave Mr Mercy to me.
Sail ho-ho.
Sail ho-ho.
- Have the bosun pipe the chorus.
- Pipe the chorus.
The Queda merchant, sure enough.
Can you make her out Captain Rawson?
She hasn't the cut of a buccaneer Your Excellency.
Much too tidy for that more like a King's ship.
Yet she has the lines of a merchantman.
- Have the longboat ready and manned.
- Longboat off board.
Stand by to putty a shot across her bows Mr Mercy.
Aye sir.
Number four gun crew stand by for action.
She's flying the English colors.
Perhaps she is our escort ship.
It was about here we were to meet, wasn't it?
Though we make it certain just the same.
Mr Gillian, see that all hands are at their stations.
Very good, sir.
Ready? Fire.
Well placed Mr Mercy.
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard.
Starboard she is sir.
You will come across with us in the longboat Mr Mercy.
And pay my compliments to all officers, who will dress as befitting a King's ship.
Aye sir.
Captain William Kidd of his Majesty's privateer Adventure at your service sir.
Mr Povey me surgeon,
Mr Mercy me master, Mr Lorenzo me navigator.
Welcome aboard gentlemen, I'm Captain Rawson.
I'm Lord Fallsworth, his Majesty's ambassador at the court of the Grand Mogul.
Your obedient servant sir.
I've been sent to give you convoy and we better make haste with our business.
These are unhealthy waters, the ship could be hove to, as I discovered a day or so ago.
You mean you sighted some of the pirate brotherhood?
More than that sir, we beat off two of them.
Avery and Culliford, out of Last Hope, some thirty leagues South of here.
Oh stop there, I nearly forgot, could you spare us some powder.
For we used more then expected in the action?
Why, all that you need sir, and welcome.
Mr Lorenzo here could attend to that then?
Oh Mr Gillian, take Mr Lorenzo below and see to that he gets what he wants.
- Aye aye sir.
- Captain.
I'll send for the master gunner, he'll take care of all your needs.
Mr Lorenzo.
Take this powder and put it in the longboat.
Aye aye sir.
Gentlemen, my daughter.
The Lady Anne Dunstan.
Captain Kidd, Mr Povey, Mr Mercy.
- Haven't we met before?
- I think not, My Lady.
You remind me of someone I've seen.
I think it impossible that we could have ever met.
Perhaps.
How do we proceed now, Captain?
Well, I'm instructed to give you protection past Madagascar.
And you'll be safe as long as we sail in company.
But Avery will be a wolf at your heels and if we are separated in darkness or storm...
And what would you advise then, sir?
Well...
I suppose we could take
Lord Fallsworth and Lady Anne... aboard the Adventure of Madagascar and then if we are separated and this...
- vessel should be taken...
- What about the treasure on board?
One silver chest alone.
A present to
His Majesty from the Grand Mogul.
Contains precious gems valued at more than a million pounds.
May I suggest, your Excellency...
Now, why not transfer the treasure chest with yourself and Lady Anne... on board the Adventure until we are out of danger?
- She is a King's ship.
- That is a great responsibility.
And although my instructions are that you are to trust me in all matters...
- I don't know if I could go so far as...
- What else can we do?
Three of them against us?
Or even two sir, we'd be helpless.
- It's the wisest course.
- I defer to your Excellency.
Now could we inspect the chests?
We could have them slung into our boats along with the...
- gear of Lord Fallsworth and Lady Anne.
- Why, certainly. This way Captain.
No trouble at all.
Hoist away.
Mr Povey.
I've sent for the manifest Captain.
You may check it against the content of this chest and give me your receipt, if you will.
Gladly, gladly.
Oh, there you are Mr Lorenzo.
Have you completed your business?
Almost sir.
Your people have been most kind Capitan Rawson.
There is only one detail left, it will not take a minute.
Finish it up then, we must be gone within the hour.
Yes Capitan.
- The manifest sir.
- Would you attend to that Mr Povey?
Thank you very much Captain.
Come Mr Lorenzo.
You've seen a lovely lady before this.
A tribute to your beauty Ma'am.
Did you finish your business below?
Yes Capitan Kidd.
Then we better be under way.
Mr Mercy, you will see Lord Fallsworth and the Lady Anne into the boat.
Aye sir.
Make way for the longboat.
You will have the luggage Mr Lorenzo.
I apologize My Lady for our poor accommodation.
But me valet Shadwell will see that you are made comfortable.
A pleasure to have your Ladyship aboard, if you will follow me please.
Why hasn't it happened?
- She's blown up.
- Someone must touch over her magazine.
Send down some boats at once sir.
You ask me to risk men near that?
- Let it go.
- Captain.
Papa.
Excuse me My Lady.
Your father, may I say how sorry I am.
The captain is requested that you take your meals in the main cabin.
Oh no Shadwell, I can't bear to face those men. I can't.
I quite understand My Lady.
But the Captain's orders are orders.
Shadwell, you must help me, there's no one else I can trust.
What can I do My Lady? I'm only a servant.
Where can I turn?
I'm so confused and frightened.
I keep thinking of my father and the others lost back there.
But on this ship wherever
I go, those horrible staring men.
Like Lorenzo, who's always standing behind me, beside me.
Last night there was a tapping on the door.
When I opened it there he was, the evil smiling face of his.
We might've been better along with those pirates you fought a few days ago.
Pirates Milady? We fought no pirates.
Well, my father said Captain Kidd told...
Shadwell, what manner of ship this is?
My father was killed deliberately, I'm sure of it.
That's why I can't bear to face your Captain, I'd accuse him.
There's a man on board My Lady, a gentleman.
Whom I know you can trust.
- Mr Mercy?
- Yes my Lady.
Shadwell, I know I've met or seen him before no matter how he denies it.
His name isn't Mercy, who is he?
All I really know is My Lady, he is no friend of the Captain's.
Perhaps if I ask him, he'll, shall I?
- Oh yes, will you please?
- Yes, My Lady.
I'm asking you again very nice...
My dear Capitan.
Your fancy manners do not impress me Mr Lorenzo.
- When do we divide the gold?
- In London, not before.
Then look Capitan,
I will make a bargain with you.
A bargain? Everybody wants to bargain with me, you and Mercy.
Farther and farther, who do you think I am, a stinking sausage merchant?
What kind of a bargain?
The girl.
All my life I have dreamed of a beautiful woman like that.
Give me half of my dinero now and you can split the rest between you.
If you will let me have her.
Five on him, he's smitten with love again.
I want her and I'm going to take her.
Whether I like it or not?
With all this treasure on board the crew is like a barrel of hot gunpowder...
All that is needed is a word in the right ears.
Do you mean mutiny? You're a witness.
- He is inciting the crew to mutiny.
- No, no, no, no, Capitan.
I was only joking.
You have a very nasty way of joking Mr Lorenzo.
As for the girl, I've my own plans for her and they do not include you.
Get out.
- Who is it?
- Adam Mercy.
Mister I...
- Thank you for coming, Mr Mercy, I...
- My name is Adam Blayne.
Son of Lord Blayne?
I knew it, I knew.
What are you doing on this ship?
My father was killed and accused of piracy.
- Few people believe that Lord Blayne...
- The King did it.
That's why I went to sea and turned pirate three years ago, that's why I'm on this ship.
I knew that someday I'd come upon the truth.
And you have?
It was Captain Kidd who killed your father, wasn't it?
Adam I am no fool, he did the same thing to my father.
The fat butcher.
It's taken me three years to track him down, three years of degradation.
Now I got him where
I want him and he knows it.
- You mean he knows who you are?
- He knows something.
That's why you didn't get me to know you, why you avoided me.
If Kidd knew we shared this he'd kill you with... as little compunction as he means to kill me, if I let him.
What can I do to help?
There must be something.
Forget everything you've seen on this ship.
Play up to him, be friendly.
That way you'll be safe.
Now, when you get back to London, no matter what has happened to me...
Go to the Lord of the Admiralty and the King.
You'll be doing me a great service as well as yourself.
I will Adam, I promise.
We're going to have trouble with Lorenzo.
Speaking as a lion who's exciting the tiger.
His blood is getting too rich for him.
He'd be the better for a bleeding.
Things are getting a bit complicated me Lord.
The King may accept the elimination of the Queda merchant as an accident.
Maybe even the sudden demise of Lord Fallsworth.
But what about the Lady?
You said you had plans for her, do they include...
Mr Povey, the little dear is as safe with me as if she was me daughter.
My passion is power and gold, since she suspects nothing...
I'll deliver her to His Majesty along with his share of the Queda Merchant's goods...
I'll weep appropriately over the untimely demise of her Pa.
Receive the grateful thanks of me Sovereign and a peerage is mine.
Mi lord.
That is your will but that's what I'll have.
And neither man nor devils shall stop me.
- Shadwell.
- Señorita, Milady. Do not be alarmed.
Now that she knows who I am and what kind of a ship she's on.
I think we can count on her to keep ahead.
You stay here till I come off watch.
Help.
Shadwell.
Use your head Mr Povey.
Luck with us tonight, which of either them would you like to see survive?
Mr Mercy, you did well to protect her.
- Are you alright sir?
- Yes, I'm alright, look after Lady Anne.
Adam, what's the matter?
My medallion is gone, has the Blayne crest on it.
Blayne?
Perhaps I can find it for you sir.
No, it must've come off just before
Lorenzo went through the port.
- Shadwell, take Lady Anne to her cabin.
- Please Adam, I can't go in there.
You must Anne, this is serious, it involves you.
Remember, no matter what tricks he tries, you've never seen me before and you don't know who I am.
- Shadwell I think...
- Don't worry about me sir.
He never could get anything out of me and he never will.
It's the only way you'll be safe.
Shadwell will watch out of you.
What about you Adam? What will he do?
The same thing he's done with the others, if he gets a chance.
Oh Adam.
Don't worry Anne, at least I know what to expect.
Go now.
Shadwell, if anything does happen, remember you're to stand by Lady Anne and...
- see that she gets safely to London.
- I'll stake my life on it sir.
- I know you will.
- Be careful Adam.
Please be careful.
Come My Lady.
- He's no King's man.
- Who is he then?
Tomorrow we put into the lagoon for water, while the crew is getting it on board... you and me and Mr Mercy is going to the cave.
You aren't taking him there?
I've a peculiar humor to watch my clever young friend's face when we dig up that chest.
Sweet dreams.
Dig fast Mr Mercy, we haven't got forever.
Who might this be?
Perhaps a man that asked too many questions.
Gently now Mr Mercy, you've came on something.
- So it was the Twelve Apostles, hey Captain?
- Yes it was Mr Mercy.
Open it up.
- Blayne's.
- Blayne's.
He was a brave seaman but foolish.
Did you happen to know him Mr Mercy?
- I've heard of him.
- I thought perhaps you had.
This... is yours, isn't it?
I traded a ring for it.
- One of Avery's men.
- Yes.
When I encountered Lord Blayne at sea
I did my simple duty as a loyal subject.
A pity he turned pirate and traitor to his King.
Liar.
He's meat for the sharks now Mr Povey.
The tide closes this place in half an hour, we've nothing more to fear.
Yes you have Captain, Lady Anne.
It's a long voyage home Mr
Povey and anything might happen.
Naturally her Ladyship is still very distressed sir.
In the midst of life we are in death Shadwell.
- Although me heart...
- My heart sir.
My heart bleeds...
Confound you Shadwell, you've drove the thought right out of me... and it was an uncommon pretty one.
- I'm sure of that sir.
- Go to her at once.
Tell her she can't mourn forever and I shall expect... her to take her meals in the main cabin with the rest of us.
Very well sir.
Poor lad.
We turned just in time to see him go over the edge.
Searched for an hour, never came out.
Well, here's to him.
Wherever he is. You filling ill?
Yes sir.
I'll go to my cabin with your permission.
If you wish, it's been quite a trying voyage.
What with one little thing or another but bear up, you'll soon be home again.
I warned Adam not to go.
- No one could've stopped him.
- Was cold bloody, planned, deliberate.
The same will happen to her Ladyship, unless we can...
Adam.
Adam, how did you?
If he finds you on board sir?
- I've come back for Lady Anne.
- Oh, thank you sir.
I've been hanging on the rudder chain since dark waiting for the turn of the watch.
The jolly-boat is moored astern.
I've waited along side, it's secured right down this port.
Bart, get in it then, flip at under the main cabin.
Well now, get me some dry clothes.
Shadwell, where is the captain?
In his own cabin with Mr Povey, sir.
Examining the silver chest they brought back on board sir.
My father's chest.
Shadwell, Kidd doesn't suspect you.
Tell Lady Anne to get some things together and when the coast is clear you come back for me.
Yes, sir.
- Master.
- Aye sir.
Rouse out both watches at daybreak, we'll weigh on the morning tide.
Aye sir.
Adam.
Kidd doesn't suspect Shadwell, he's staying on board and he'll be evidence for us in London.
Bart has a small boat moored astern, we'll row ashore.
Then where Adam?
Two days journey overland is the pirate town of Last Hope.
It's the most lawless place on earth but I've friends there.
- Somehow they'll find us a ship for England.
- England?
- Now.
- Come on.
Sit down in the bow.
Goodbye My Lady, goodbye My Lord. Godspeed.
I'll see you in England.
- Ahoy there, who's in that boat now?
- Come on.
Come on.
Fire.
Thank you... melord.
Fire.
Down the longboat.
Bart.
Bart.
Hold on to me.
Take her away.
- They're as dead as a mackerel.
- He's gone through.
Now, I guess that's the end of them Captain.
And good riddance. Back to the ship boys.
If you are thinking what I think you're thinking my friend, forget it.
There's the little matter of a letter I've left in London.
Spoilsport.
Captain William Kidd.
Greetings Captain, what news have you brought me from the Indian seas?
By your leave Your Majesty, both good and ill, but mostly very good indeed.
I returned by way of the American colonies Sire.
So I understood. With the main points of your voyage, I am familiar.
I wonder if you could enlighten me... about the affair of the Queens godchild Lady
Anne Dunstan and your ship-master Mr Mercy?
Oh that poor impetuous fellow Sire... inveigled that bud of innocence he did, into running away with him.
And catching him red handed in defense of me very life I was force to dispatch them both.
Rest in peace.
Tell me Captain about the treasure and the Queda merchant.
Unfortunate Sire, most unfortunate.
We shipped that chest when that ship blew and all souls went heavenward.
Rest in peace to them, ditto.
I see.
And after Twelve Apostles and Lord
Blayne, did you encounter any trace?
Nay Sire, I can only hope that the weight of his sins sank both him and his ship.
I see, then how do you explain this?
Whose might that be Your Majesty?
My officers found it on your ship at
Plymouth after you left for London.
It bears the Blayne crest with which I believe you are not unfamiliar.
I've always thought that
Mr Povey, me surgeon, a very wily... fellow indeed was hiding something from me.
Hiding it in a secret locker in your cabin Captain?
I hope Mr Povey has a proper explanation Sire.
Mr Povey was killed three days ago defending it... with his dying oath he swore it was not his.
Perhaps Shadwell, me valet slipped it aboard.
Might it not have come from a Madagascar cave Captain?
Time will get me clear about all this Your Majesty.
Enough of your lies.
Look.
A nightmare.
Pity you overlooked Last Hope Captain.
We stood on the headland with my friend Avery and watched you sail by.
May it please Your Majesty I accuse this man of piracy and murder.
Was ever a gentleman so misfortunate?
Lock him up in Newgate.
He's to be held for the next session of the court, there to be tried for his life.
Hands off me, you scum.
All I've done was to the credit and for the honor and glory of England.
So here's me bequest, to them what hunts what I have hid... and to their sons' sons, down trough the endless corridors of time...
Greed, that spawns murder.
Hatred, that corrodes the soul.
Ambition, the foulest strumpet of all.
Hey Jack, Jack hey, sell me that hang-rope for sixpence, will you?
Save your money me lad.
You can have it all for nothing if you'd only step up here and wear it.
Hurry up Jack, can't wait forever.
Captain Kidd is dead
My Lord Blayne, his account is closed.
Now, in what manner can I atone for the injustice I worked upon your father?
Offer you a First Sea Lord? What you suggest?
We have a fine frigate of fifty guns.
Commissioned for American waters Sire.
That we sought of naming, the Lady Anne.
It shall be a wedding gift to you from the Crown... for your loyalty and service to King and Country.
Put that away.  
We've gotta get Lang alive. 
Hello, Barnett? 
This is Pete at Lang's place.   
Dr. Lang just drove out with Billy Batson.  
They took the Mill Valley Road. 
Mill Valley Road? All right.
I'll head 'em off.  
Mill Valley Road.   
Can't you go any faster?
I'll run him off the road.   
Billy! Billy!   
[ Coughs ]  
There's-- There's been an accident.
So I see.   
Are you hurt?   
No, but my companion, he's unconscious.   
We'll be glad to take him along too.  
Our orders were to get Lang, but the Scorpion will be glad to get Batson too. 
Now if you'll-- if you'll take me to--  
We know where to take you.  
Get in. 
Wh-What do you mean?
I said get in!  
The Scorpion!   
Yes, Dr. Lang, the Scorpion.   
It's a pleasure to see you here.
Please, be seated.  
Billy Batson was with him, so I brought him along. 
Splendid.   
Where's Batson? 
Downstairs under guard. 
He's unconscious.   
I'll attend to him when 
I finish with Dr. Lang. 
What do you want of me? 
Your lens to help complete the golden scorpion atom smasher.   
That's something I--
I'll never give you.
I think I can change your mind.   
Barnett, prepare to loosen  
Dr. Lang's tongue.  
Are you going to talk now, Dr. Lang?  
 Yes! Yes!  
 Anything you wish! 
Release him, Barnett.   
Where's your lens?  
In my library.  
There's a painting. 
 Behind the painting,   
 there's-- there's a safe.  
Write down the combination. 
Get the lens from Lang's safe at once.   
Yes, sir.   
Wait.   
Something should be done with Batson.
Do you want me to take care of him?
No. That's a pleasure   
I'm reserving for myself.   
I'll have him brought up. 
Wha-- What are you going to do with me?
Nothing, until I know your lens is where you say it is. 
[ Footsteps Approaching ]   
He hasn't come to yet.  
Well, get some water and bring him out of it.
Shazam! 
[ Screams ] 
Captain Marvel! 
Yes. Now I'll learn who you really are. 
And that gun of yours isn't going to stop me. 
But I think it will.
Dr. Lang will die if you come one step closer.
[ Rings ]   
Mr. Malcolm's secretary speaking.   
Who? Oh, Dr. Lang.  
- Let me talk to Malcolm.   
- Mr. Malcolm's out of town.
The Scorpion's men are after my lens.  
Can I be of any assistance? 
The safe in your library?   
Yes, that's right.  
It's in the alcove behind a painting.  
The combination is R-24--   
Now, Betty, repeat that combination to me. 
And then back to R-11.  
I'll start at once. 
Now, Betty, there's something   
I must warn you about.  
There's a death trap in the--
 [ Door Opens ] 
You're the Scorpion?
Dr. Lang! Dr. Lang! 
Betty-- Save her.   
Go to my house. 
Why?
Lens in my safe.
There's a death trap.   
Save her.   
Pete, we're gonna be busy inside. Understand?
Sure.   
Lock up the gates and keep out of sight.  
This must be it.
This is it! 
Open up those panels.   
Here's the combination. 
Right, 24.  
Shazam! 
Betty! Betty!   
Fix everything just the way you found it.   
And here's the combination. 
But he talked about some danger.
A matter of life or death, he said.
I think I know what he meant.  
There was a man with a gun as you drove up.
Really? Where is he?
He's been well taken care of. 
Let's go get that lens. 
He said it was in the alcove, didn't he?  
Yes, behind the painting.   
This is it. 
Read the combination to me. 
Right, 24.  
Left, 18.   
Right, nine.
Left, 16.   
Right, seven.   
Left, 10.   
And here's the last number: right, 11.
{2393}{2457}After months of secret preparations...
{2461}{2580}... a far-reaching, combined operation|is about to begin.
{2735}{2782}Continued secrecy is imperative...
{2822}{2879}... for the plan 's success.
{5303}{5368}We've cornered the chili sauce market|for you, sir.
{5372}{5429}Good work, Cookie.|Got steaks to go with it?
{5433}{5480}Yes, sir.
{5486}{5532}Captain, last torpedo's on board.

{5916}{5964}Any luck on that Oklahoma City call?
{5974}{6054}Sorry, Captain Cassidy, I haven't|gotten through to your wife.
{6058}{6108}You know how it is. Christmas Eve.
{6112}{6199}Yes, I know how it is.
{6206}{6282}Thank you. Cancel the call.
{6672}{6728}Hi, Rocky. That kid of yours|been born yet?
{6732}{6827}- Yes, sir. It's a boy.|- What, no cigar?
{6831}{6924}- Congratulations, Rocky.|- Thank you, sir.
{7052}{7087}- Captain.|- What, Sparks?
{7091}{7181}- I got the record changer all hooked up.|- So I hear.
{7186}{7252}The crew certainly does appreciate|your gift, sir.
{7256}{7362}Well, after five patrols,|I appreciate my crew, Sparks.
{7816}{7879}Full fuel, lube, oil, battery|and fresh water.
{7883}{7937}Engineering department|ready for sea, sir.
{7941}{8012}Request permission to warm up|the main engine.
{8021}{8087}- Okay, Larry.|- Thank you, sir.
{8091}{8205}Sweetheart, we're shoving off|ahead of schedule.
{8209}{8264}Something urgent.
{8268}{8336}I tried to telephone you|and the children...
{8340}{8394}... to wish you a merry Christmas...
{8398}{8518}... and to tell you I'm now wearing|three stripes on my sleeve...
{8552}{8660}... and some embarrassingly shiny|scrambled eggs on my cap.
{8664}{8740}I hope you like|the nylon stockings, darling.
{8744}{8812}Don 't ask me how I got them.
{8835}{8934}Tell Michael I couldn 't find|a toy submarine.
{8949}{9026}Tell him it's the war.|He'll understand.
{9030}{9123}There's even a shortage of teddy bears,|but I found one for Debby.

{10573}{10625}Gather around, men.
{10739}{10788}I'm sorry your liberty was cut short.
{10792}{10916}The Navy would've let us have Christmas|ashore if this wasn't important.

{11278}{11338}You may be infants in|the submarine service...
{11342}{11417}...but you'll be veterans|by the time we make port again.
{11421}{11465}We've had pretty fair luck so far.
{11469}{11540}Let's hope we really smear them|this time.
{11556}{11622}- Dismiss the crew.|- Aye, aye, sir.
{11628}{11667}Leave your quarters.
{11792}{11910}Shore connection is clear. Topside|secured, all except mooring lines.
{11924}{11970}Okay, chief.
{11988}{12065}All tested out. Ship ready|for getting under way, sir.
{12069}{12129}Number one and two|main engines on propulsion.
{12133}{12194}Okay, let's go.
{12198}{12242}Single up!
{12308}{12356}Answer bells.
{12360}{12408}Take in one!
{12426}{12483}Pull five! Port, back one-third.
{12560}{12616}Port, stop.
{12620}{12679}Take in five!
{12710}{12767}All ahead one-third.
{13264}{13372}- Hatch secured.|- Report, forward room rigged for diving.
{13409}{13477}What do you think you are?|The pipes of Pan?
{13481}{13532}This, Dakota, is a genuine Nazi flute.
{13536}{13608}- I paid an Atlantic sailor 5 bucks for it.|- Nazi flute?
{13612}{13666}You can get them in Frisco for four bits.
{13675}{13740}- You know of Tarpon Springs, Florida?|- Sure.
{13744}{13776}- You do?|- Yeah.
{13780}{13856}The best fishermen in the world|are the Greeks, my people.
{13860}{13892}You're Greek?
{13896}{13941}- Greek-American.|- What's your name?
{13945}{14027}Leos Deopoulis Gurfelis Junior.|That "junior" is pure American.
{14031}{14127}But seeing you're off a destroyer|we'll settle for "Tin Can." Okay?
{14131}{14225}Okay, just so long as nobody|around here calls me "Hey, Greek."
{14229}{14283}- I'm sensitive.|- Oh, Mike.
{14307}{14355}Surprise.
{14411}{14453}Here's that 5-spot I borrowed.
{14457}{14563}- Fine time to pay me back.|- But I did pay you.
{14584}{14685}There goes one of the nicest guys|that ever borrowed 5 bucks from me.
{14700}{14760}Why doesn't the captain|wear his decorations?
{14764}{14840}- Doesn't need to.|- We heard a lot about him at sub school.
{14844}{14896}You can believe anything that was good.
{14900}{15002}Those torpedoes cost 12,000 bucks|apiece. Our skipper doesn't waste them.
{15006}{15096}He's got more plain intestinal fortitude|than any guy I ever met.
{15100}{15160}I'd follow him right into|the mikado's bathtub.
{15164}{15206}Do you think we'll see action?
{15210}{15268}Good. That's why I got off|that four-stacker.
{15272}{15341}Up and down, nothing but escorting.|Made me sick.
{15345}{15409}- Sitting on a beehive?|- I know. He wants a medal.
{15413}{15476}Who cares about medals?|I got a better reason.
{15480}{15540}Pipe down. Look.
{15544}{15670}In all my 12 years in the Navy,|I never seen a doll on a submarine.
{15722}{15796}I won her, Mike. Cute, huh?
{15814}{15874}- She gonna bunk with you?|- Yep.
{15878}{15934}She's a liberty gimmick.|Makes gals jealous.
{15938}{15975}- Jealous of that doll?|- Sure.
{15979}{16037}I take her into a joint, sit her on a table.
{16041}{16103}Then we have a long talk.|It never fails.
{16107}{16176}Dame comes up and says,|"That's the best you can do?"
{16180}{16227}I says, "That's up to you, honey."
{16250}{16300}What happens then?
{16304}{16365}- How old are you, Tommy?|- Nineteen.
{16369}{16419}Come back next year.
{16444}{16522}Say, that's a cute military objective|you got there.
{16535}{16632}- That's my sister.|- Oh, intelligent too.
{16642}{16756}Well, if you boys don't mind, Nita and I,|we want to be alone, don't we?
{16760}{16872}See? It's cute. I told you.|You know, it works all the time.
{17125}{17198}Passed the submarine net, captain.
{17242}{17346}Well, Andy, it'll be a long time|between beers.
{17950}{18012}Merry Christmas, Mike.
{18114}{18179}Merry Christmas, Tommy.
{18288}{18362}This is the first Christmas|I ever spent underwater.
{18366}{18450}You should have been aboard with us|Christmas Day 1941.
{18454}{18516}The Japs sure gave us|a Christmas present.
{18520}{18609}Blasted the living daylights out of us|off Lingayen Gulf.
{18613}{18696}Between depth charges,|we ate Christmas dinner in the dark...
{18700}{18785}...200 feet down.|Ice water and sandwiches.
{18789}{18944}Well-sprinkled with rust and chips of|paint that kept flying off the bulkheads.
{18948}{19101}- Bet you said your prayers.|- I sure did. Some extra Hail Marys too.
{19105}{19184}- You think prayers do any good, Mike?|- Sure, they do.
{19188}{19259}Some guys say, "Go ahead, prove to me|there's a God."
{19263}{19381}I don't argue. I just know,|like I know there's salt in the sea.
{19385}{19432}That's the way it is with me too.
{19436}{19551}Look, Mike, if we get depth-charged,|and I show any signs of being yellow...
{19555}{19614}...you sock me.|- Right on the button.
{19618}{19707}- That's a promise?|- It's a promise.
{19711}{19776}If I were in Connecticut now...
{19780}{19868}...Mother and Dad would come in|to wake me singing Christmas carols.
{19872}{19943}It's sort of a custom they started|when I was a kid.
{20110}{20182}Pretty, ain't it?|Those guys practice all year for this.
{20186}{20245}- Merry Christmas.|- Merry Christmas, you guys!
{20249}{20299}- Merry Christmas, Tin Can!|- Happy Noel.
{20303}{20339}Same to you and many more.
{20556}{20604}Merry Christmas, skipper.
{20612}{20663}Merry Christmas, fellas.
{20667}{20714}Merry Christmas, skipper.
{21536}{21596}And a very merry Christmas|to you gents.
{21600}{21669}We'll have to top the diesels.
{22544}{22614}Hey, get a load of him, will you?
{22712}{22754}Presents.
{22841}{22911}"For Pills, the pharmacist's mate,|a mournful knell.
{22915}{23002}He dropped his vitamins|down the periscope well."
{23009}{23052}So, what do you got?
{23080}{23137}"The new kid forward|is wiser but sadder.
{23141}{23220}Since he stepped on the skipper|coming down the ladder!"
{23224}{23280}I apologized.
{23300}{23355}"On Wolf's grave, a wreath is laid.
{23359}{23455}Since he tangled his line|with that chambermaid."
{23459}{23495}- Come on, open it.|- Open it!
{23737}{23788}You should have had it filled.
{23816}{23872}"All hands get ready|to upchuck this dinner.
{23876}{23960}With Cookie in the galley,|we're going to get thinner."
{24020}{24056}Fine, listen.
{24060}{24160}If that ain't a new high|for gratitude.
{24164}{24243}Who practically mothers|all the guys on this ship?
{24247}{24284}I do.
{24288}{24370}Who bends over a hot stove|all day long for you guys?
{24374}{24406}I do.
{24416}{24492}Who's going to get all the glory|when you sink a Jap ship?
{24496}{24539}You! That's who.
{24543}{24609}Who's gonna get the medals|from this war? You guys!
{24613}{24748}And what am I going to get? Nothing but|varicose veins and dishwater hands!
{24755}{24804}Open it! Open it!
{24822}{24871}What have you got? Open it.
{25245}{25293}Gee, guys.
{25309}{25378}You shouldn't have done it.
{25450}{25504}Lookouts to the bridge.
{25508}{25544}Keep your eyes peeled, kid.
{25548}{25619}All submarines look alike.|We're nobody's friend.
{25623}{25720}Even our ships will shoot first|and ask questions afterward.
{25744}{25800}He listens to you like you were|a tin god.
{26107}{26224}- Look pretty snappy today, captain.|- You know, Christmas.
{26410}{26489}- Coffee, sir.|- Thank you.
{26519}{26598}- All clear starboard.|- All clear port.
{26618}{26676}You fellas know me.|I'm no highbrow.
{26680}{26752}When I come home, if there's|any grand opera playing...
{26756}{26845}...the whole Connors family goes|down there twice a week.
{26849}{26932}Don't ask me why, but to me, it's like|going down in a sub.
{26936}{27012}You shove off,|go deep under the sea.
{27016}{27048}When you come back up...
{27052}{27129}...you got something inside|that's never been there before.
{27133}{27181}Irish and Greeks, born philosophers.
{27186}{27219}I got a philosophy too.
{27223}{27305}Every day a box of Cracker Jacks|with a prize in every package.
{27309}{27380}I feel sorry for you.|You don't know what family means.
{27384}{27464}Family means a house has a mortgage,|the kids have measles...
{27468}{27568}...and the old man pays for the insurance|when he's dead. No, not for Wolfie.
{27572}{27640}The only babies I want|are those born 21 years ago.
{27644}{27732}Captain has given permission to pick up|the San Francisco newscast.
{27743}{27824}This broadcast comes to you|from the Friendly Credit Company.
{27828}{27956}The Friendly Credit Company trusts you.|Any amount from $ 25 to $ 1000.
{27963}{28058}And so Christmas Day|is bright on all fronts.
{28062}{28148}San Francisco police are continuing|the manhunt for a sailor...
{28152}{28199}... wanted on several counts.
{28205}{28277}The woman making the complaints|insists on prosecution.
{28281}{28384}The sailor was last seen boarding a|United States submarine at Mare Island.
{28388}{28496}The sailor is known to the girls|only as "Wolf."
{28513}{28589}- Well, Wolfie!|- Shut up.
{28594}{28675}However, his shipmates volunteered|information to the police.
{28679}{28760}Enough to send him up for 1042 years.
{28768}{28878}The Wolf has been described as a body|of man entirely surrounded by women.
{28882}{28914}- He's...|- Terrific!
{28919}{28954}Terrific.
{29034}{29085}It's just a gag, Wolfie. Just a gag.
{29089}{29161}Captain give you permission|to pull that stunt?
{29165}{29248}- Yes, sir.|- I was in on the gag too.
{29252}{29343}- Were you?|- Well, just around the edges.
{29504}{29609}- Plane coming in at the sun!|- Clear the bridge! Take her down!
{30053}{30105}- Hatch secured!|- Battle stations manned.
{30109}{30154}Main induction closed.
{30515}{30555}What was it?
{30559}{30616}Looked like a four-motor|bomber to me.
{30622}{30656}Pressure in the boat, sir.
{30920}{30982}Level off at 150 feet.
{30992}{31050}- Rig for depth charge.|- Rig for depth charge.
{31056}{31116}Close main vents.
{31132}{31166}Main vents closed, sir.
{31170}{31241}- Blow negative.|- Blow negative.
{31255}{31327}- Close negative flood.|- Close negative flood.
{31331}{31368}Negative flood closed, sir.
{31374}{31435}- Level off at 150.|- Level off at 150.
{31608}{31666}- Zero bubble.|- Zero bubble.
{31795}{31847}Open all vents.
{31952}{32036}- All ahead one-third.|- All ahead one-third.
{32060}{32110}All answering ahead one-third, sir.
{32114}{32174}- Pump from auxiliary to sea.|- Auxiliary to sea!
{32219}{32319}- Can we hear it when it comes?|- Yep, son.
{32323}{32370}We'll hear it, all right.
{32414}{32520}- Isn't there anything we can do?|- Yep. We're doing it.
{32596}{32648}Maybe it's one of our own planes.
{32656}{32720}If we sink, it doesn't matter|who drops the bombs.
{33227}{33283}Think they can see|our shadow from the air?
{33287}{33342}That's what we're finding out.
{33619}{33671}All clear, sir.
{33681}{33743}Let's go up for a look-see.|Periscope depth.
{33750}{33811}Periscope depth. Five degrees up angle.
{33815}{33895}- Twenty-degree rise on the bow planes.|- Five degrees up angle.
{33899}{33975}- Twenty-degree rise, sir.|- Take charge of your planes.
{34268}{34308}Up a foot.
{34524}{34601}Maybe that plane had feathers.
{34605}{34694}Looks as if we dunked|for a four-motored albatross.
{34698}{34777}Service, down scope.|Have a merry Christmas, men.
{34781}{34927}- Gee, fellas. I could have sworn...|- Albatross have retractable landing gear?
{34936}{34998}Lookouts to the bridge!
{35002}{35096}- You can hear that motor so plain!|- Key down. He feels bad enough.
{35612}{35680}Watch out, or they'll give you|an E for imagination.
{35684}{35731}Lay off him, Rocky.
{35735}{35767}That's all right, son.
{35771}{35863}I'd rather submerge for 100 birds|than not submerge for one plane.
{35867}{35921}Thank you, sir.
{36234}{36327}- All clear starboard.|- All clear port.
{36948}{36996}Hello, Andy.
{37000}{37078}Almost 24 hours out now, skipper.|About time to open orders?
{37083}{37140}Three minutes to go, Andy.
{37144}{37212}I got a hunch it's something big.
{37223}{37288}Last night, I dreamed|we upped periscope.
{37292}{37369}Right in the middle of|the entire Jap imperial fleet.
{37373}{37419}Passing in review.
{37423}{37506}- Did we sink them all?|- With one torpedo.
{37510}{37542}Billiard shot.
{37546}{37608}By the way, there's a man|from the forward room.
{37612}{37694}Wants to see you on a matter|of vital importance.
{37707}{37804}- Torpedoman Adams.|- Send him in.
{37955}{38069}I was told I'd have to ask you, sir.
{38130}{38172}Go ahead. Ask me.
{38176}{38270}Sir, at sub school, we saw a lot|of pictures of submariners...
{38274}{38362}...coming back from patrols with beards.
{38366}{38454}- So you want to grow one?|- Yes, sir.
{38484}{38577}- Think you can?|- Sir, I'd like to find out.
{38592}{38650}Well, I'll tell you, Adams.
{38654}{38737}First patrol, we all grew beards.|I had a pip.
{38741}{38788}The second patrol was|half and half.
{38792}{38884}Then we decided beards are itchy.|They get greasy. We keep a trim ship.
{38888}{38944}Makes sense we have a trim crew|to man her.
{38948}{38980}Yes, sir.
{38984}{39064}But I don't want to cheat you|of a beard on your first patrol.
{39068}{39150}Oh, that's all right, sir.|I only shave twice a week anyway.
{39154}{39212}If I could grow one,|it'd look a little limp.
{39223}{39303}I'll stick to shaving twice a week, sir.
{39307}{39387}Maybe when we get back,|you'll be shaving three times a week.
{39406}{39509}Thank you, sir. I guess I'd better|get back and do what I was doing.
{39513}{39560}Thank you.
{40580}{40640}Send the quartermaster|with the chart catalog.
{40649}{40729}Captain wants the chart catalog, Rocky.
{40834}{40898}- Chart catalog, sir.|- Thank you. Stand by.
{40930}{40986}- Has he come yet?|- No. He's still in there.
{41008}{41076}- Bring in chart 1291.|- Aye, aye, sir.
{41134}{41252}Just get out that old chart of Tahiti.|I got a tomato in Papeete.
{41269}{41315}Poetry.
{41665}{41725}Gonna write a letter|to your wife every night?
{41729}{41823}- Yep. Sort of keeps us in touch.|- Doesn't make sense if there's no mail.
{41827}{41871}Who knows? We might hit Australia.
{41877}{41934}Then again, we might not.
{42069}{42123}Funny thing about submarines.
{42127}{42211}The crew always knows where|we're going before the captain does.
{42581}{42623}Holy smoke! Tokyo?
{42627}{42691}I always wanted to see those geisha gals|up-close.
{42695}{42747}Too bad you didn't study|"Japany" lingo.
{42751}{42832}Listen, my kind of language|is international.
{42864}{42938}How are we going to get|into Tokyo Bay?
{42942}{43002}The Copperfin just naturally|sprouts wings.
{43006}{43060}We fly over the nets|and the minefields...
{43064}{43152}...plumb in the middle of the harbor.|- Tokyo Bay. Perfect.
{43156}{43216}Bet we sink 70,000 tons.|20 bucks, even money.
{43220}{43318}- Seventy thousand tons. You're nuts.|- Look, I got a reason to have luck.
{43322}{43372}Where I go, there's gonna be|dead Japs.
{43376}{43459}- What is this reason of yours?|- Never mind. Anybody wanna bet?
{43463}{43540}It's a secret between him and Roosevelt.|I'll take the bet.
{43544}{43592}I'll pay off double if we make it.
{43596}{43678}Only two guys whistle in the Navy.|Boatswain's mates and boots.
{43682}{43717}You a boatswain's mate?
{43721}{43781}I'm sorry, Mike. I forgot.
{43785}{43818}You hear that music?
{43822}{43903}- Reminds me of a dame I knew in Frisco.|- Here we go again.
{43907}{43978}She was built for speed,|like a destroyer.
{43983}{44065}- Oh, now I listen.|- Kind of compact too, like a submarine.
{44069}{44147}She was coming down Sutter Street.|Off my starboard beam.
{44151}{44200}I sees her and says, "Up periscope."
{44204}{44312}I gives my motor a third back and|maneuvers for an opening shot.
{44343}{44392}She picks me up on her detector.
{44396}{44486}Gives her rudder a hard left.|Makes like she's looking in the window.
{44494}{44597}Naturally, I gives my rudder|a hard right and moves...
{44601}{44703}... right up alongside her. She's beautiful.|But beautiful!
{44707}{44764}Comes up to about my chin.|Fits just right.
{44768}{44840}Well, neither of us breaks silence.
{44844}{44944}Naturally, there's a long pause.|We're both running on batteries now.
{44948}{45012}Something electric is going on between|her and me.
{45023}{45072}I'd been on patrol three months.
{45076}{45120}And this was|my first night ashore.
{45124}{45172}Now, you guys know how it is.
{45177}{45292}There she was in a nice, clean, crisp,|lacy blouse.
{45307}{45379}And she looked|just like she had a bath.
{45383}{45428}So she looked like she had a bath.
{45452}{45496}She even smelled like geranium.
{45500}{45572}So she even smelled like geraniums.|Then what?
{45576}{45676}Here we are, hove to,|with her smelling like geraniums...
{45680}{45740}...and me with three months' pay|in my whites.
{45748}{45810}- I'll never forget it!|- Never forget what, Wolf?
{45814}{45874}Some dames have lips that|are curved all right.
{45878}{45978}But when you kiss them, you find they|have lips as hard as a warhead?
{45982}{46108}Well, you could tell hers|was as soft as silk.
{46112}{46216}Just enough lipstick. Just right.
{46220}{46293}Well, what did you do about it?
{46297}{46373}I was so busy drinking her in|out of my starboard lamps...
{46377}{46486}... that I don 't see this Market Street|commando hove to alongside her.
{46490}{46558}I'm trying to get a recognition signal|out of her...
{46562}{46618}... when this sailor busts right in|and says:
{46622}{46676}"Would you like one|of those lacy things?"
{46680}{46741}She says, "Sure."|And they go in and buy one.
{46745}{46811}- Well, what did you do?|- Me? I'm murdered!
{46827}{46926}There I am, anchored,|dead in the water...
{46930}{46996}... looking in the window.|She's picking out one.
{47000}{47088}And this Market Street commando|is giving me the gloat!
{47092}{47143}Am I burnt. I'm dying!
{47147}{47221}My first night in. There she'd been,|standing next to me.
{47225}{47296}- Smelling like geraniums.|- Okay, we been through that.
{47300}{47379}This Market Street commando peels|off some lettuce and pays.
{47383}{47451}And she's smiling|as sweet as a dream.
{47455}{47562}And there I am, outside the window,|bulkheads busted in.
{47566}{47624}Next thing I know,|she gives this guy a kiss.
{47628}{47704}And the next thing I know,|she's making for my anchorage...
{47708}{47783}... with his stuff under her arm,|and she's saying to me:
{47787}{47830}"Going my way, submariner?"
{47834}{47899}Then what happened, Wolf?
{47903}{47974}She was built for speed,|but like I said, kid...
{47978}{48082}...kind of compact too, like a submarine.
{48383}{48485}According to the orders, we're to pick|up the lieutenant here at point x-ray.
{48489}{48565}A PBY boat will meet us at 1430.
{48569}{48607}Why are they flying him down?
{48611}{48691}Save us going out of our way|to pick him up. Time's important.
{48706}{48764}- Who is he?|- Aerology specialist.
{48768}{48821}North Pacific area.
{48825}{48884}All we have to do|is put him ashore in Japan.
{49015}{49074}You are showing signs|of needing a sun lamp.
{49078}{49142}From now on, sign up.|Everybody, once a day.
{49158}{49230}- You ever want to be a real doctor, Pills?|- Yeah.
{49234}{49318}I was one of those wise guys|who didn't know where he was going.
{49322}{49374}Funny place to find out, on submarines.
{49391}{49449}- What college did you go to?|- California.
{49453}{49503}Only a year. Then I signed up.
{49507}{49587}I had an A in chemistry,|so they made me a pharmacist's mate.
{49591}{49649}Ain't it wonderful what|an education will do?
{49653}{49735}When I got out of third grade,|I took a job at Coney Island.
{49739}{49810}- Frying hot dogs.|- You should have stuck to hot dogs.
{49828}{49868}Where's that half-baked barber?
{49896}{49950}You finishing college|when the war's over?
{49954}{50015}Yep. Putting my pay|and a half in war bonds.
{50019}{50073}Working my way|through college underwater.
{50113}{50198}Pills, if anything happened|to us while we're out on patrol...
{50202}{50296}...if we got conked off, you figure|we'd see our folks in the hereafter?
{50300}{50348}I wouldn't bank on it.
{50352}{50454}My old man wouldn't be overjoyed to see|me. He never thought I was much good.
{50458}{50518}- I like to think we got souls...|- I don't know.
{50522}{50606}All those guys I cut up at school,|never found a soul inside.
{50610}{50655}Well, what does that prove, Pills?
{50659}{50704}Say you trust a guy.
{50708}{50770}You can't see the trust,|but it's there.
{50774}{50859}- I'm from Missouri, Mike.|- I'm not exactly religious.
{50863}{50915}- But don't you think God...|- No, I don't.
{50919}{50976}My angle is, I only believe|what I can see.
{50980}{51039}- Are you an atheist?|- Call it what you like.
{51050}{51114}The Japs turn the heat on us,|I'll watch you pray.
{51118}{51172}I've seen it happen before.
{51208}{51264}- Say, you guys know what?|- No, what?
{51268}{51372}There's something screwy|about this detour or whatever it is.
{51390}{51422}We'll know before long.
{51426}{51512}Hey, Yo Yo, mind if I use your office?|Something private.
{51516}{51573}- Sure.|- Thanks.
{51630}{51696}That's the third time|he's asked me.
{51700}{51742}Well, maybe he's writing poems.
{51746}{51806}There you are, my little scissorbill.
{51810}{51842}Get thee behind me.
{51846}{51923}Mind you, no politics, no ball games,|no hair down my neck.
{51927}{51964}Nothing but barbering.
{52011}{52101}Well, Cookie, looks like we're getting|pretty close to enemy waters.
{52112}{52176}Now, Tommy, don't go|getting yourself all worried.
{52200}{52253}Think we ought to take the hat off?
{52266}{52321}Well, don't you think we'd better?
{52401}{52460}- Clippers?|- Yes, thanks.
{52486}{52597}You see, Tommy, there's always|one of two things about a submarine.
{52604}{52706}In the first place, either the enemy|finds you, or he doesn't.
{52710}{52782}If he doesn't find you,|there's nothing to worry about.
{52786}{52881}But if he does, there is still|one of two things.
{52885}{52944}Either he drops a depth charge,|or he don't.
{52948}{53026}If he doesn't, there's nothing|to worry about. If he does...
{53030}{53082}...then there's still|one of two things.
{53086}{53142}Either he drops it|close to you or far away.
{53167}{53231}If he drops them far away,|it's foolish to worry.
{53235}{53271}If he drops them near you...
{53275}{53353}...then there is still one|of two things to worry about.
{53357}{53399}And that is...
{53418}{53469}Don't cut too much off.
{53473}{53512}If your pressure hull holds.
{53516}{53588}Of course, if it holds,|wouldn't it be foolish to worry?
{53592}{53664}If it doesn't, you won't be able|to worry, so why worry?
{53681}{53724}Are you through?
{53737}{53775}Yes.
{53864}{53944}He was worth waiting for.|He's a good barber. That looks fine.
{53948}{53980}You next?
{54373}{54432}One thousand fathoms, sir.
{54723}{54791}Rudder amidships. Steady on course.
{54795}{54866}- Two-nine-zero.|- Eight hundred fathoms.
{54997}{55096}Right, five degrees rudder.|New course, 295. All motors stop.
{55100}{55213}Right, five degrees rudder.|New course, 295. All motors stop.
{55217}{55250}Three hundred fathoms.
{55546}{55584}Stations for battle surface.
{55588}{55628}Stations for battle surface.
{55723}{55773}Ready on all main engines.
{56075}{56119}Down scope.
{56755}{56806}All engines, ahead one-third.
{57706}{57776}Has the radio man picked|up anything on the frequency?
{57780}{57833}Contact established, sir.
{57940}{57988}Plane to starboard, sir.
{58092}{58135}Hold your fire.
{58170}{58218}Stand by to challenge.
{58227}{58259}Okay, Rocky.
{58437}{58483}Challenge.
{58817}{58879}Plane answered challenge|correctly, captain.
{58889}{58940}All stop. Rudder amidships.
{59244}{59304}Always nice to see|those stars on the wing.
{60200}{60278}You know, I'd sure like|to hook an Aleutian salmon.
{60282}{60352}Cute if I opened him up,|and there was a Jap in there.
{60356}{60410}Fried Jap in tartar sauce.
{60427}{60469}I'll take mine boiled in oil.
{60591}{60640}I'll go down and get him.
{61008}{61074}Lieutenant Raymond. McCary.|Welcome aboard.
{61078}{61128}- Thank you.|- Come up, meet the captain.
{61132}{61164}Thanks.
{61815}{61854}Lieutenant Raymond reporting.
{61858}{61916}- Glad to have you aboard.|- Glad to be aboard.
{61920}{61986}- Ready on one and two.|- You already know McCary.
{61990}{62042}- Yes, sir. We've met.|- How was your trip?
{62046}{62119}It was pretty rough.|Is my aerology gear aboard?
{62123}{62155}Under lock and key.
{62159}{62235}If you'll go below, we'll arrange|for your berthing later.
{62239}{62304}- I'd like to get this ship out of here.|- Yes, sir.
{62342}{62422}How do I get below? I've never|been aboard a submarine before.
{62476}{62524}There's the hatch. It goes down.
{62567}{62599}Yes, sir.
{62689}{62730}Hey! Bear a hand. I got a bite.
{62791}{62856}Planes approaching, dead astern!
{62924}{62967}Jap float Zeros.
{62971}{63027}All ahead full!|Ten degrees right rudder!
{63080}{63115}Commence firing!
{63327}{63364}Get him smack in the teeth!
{63701}{63734}Unexploded bomb forward!
{63797}{63829}We ought to be diving.
{63833}{63883}Got six fathoms under us.|Gotta get on.
{64234}{64284}Coming in low! Get down!
{64360}{64404}Good work, Wolf!
{64431}{64484}- Is he hurt badly?|- I think so, sir.
{64488}{64527}There he goes.
{64592}{64682}If that Nip doesn't get out of there,|he'll end up with a hot seat.
{64889}{64948}I could pop him off|with a clear conscience.
{64978}{65022}He looks awful Ionesome up there.
{65026}{65061}Okay.
{65065}{65133}The unexploded bomb is wedged|in the superstructure.
{65137}{65206}Let's have a look at it.|Larry, take the watch.
{65530}{65616}Pick up that Jap aviator.|I want to question him.
{65732}{65792}We'll have to bring out|the cutting torches.
{65796}{65836}No time.
{65884}{65923}I'll get your pigeon for you.
{65927}{65980}Okay, Mike.|We'll put him to roost.
{66255}{66321}Looks like the war|is over for you, son.
{66468}{66516}Mike!
{66824}{66877}That's enough, kid.
{66892}{66928}Where's Mike?
{66932}{66979}Dakota is taking him below.
{67166}{67252}Mike looked up like he|wanted me to do something.
{67275}{67318}I just stood there.
{67325}{67388}Me too. It happened so fast.
{67392}{67462}We need a man to pull the teeth|of an unexploded bomb.
{67466}{67524}Volunteers to the control room.
{67697}{67765}Mike would be alive now|if I hadn't just stood there.
{67769}{67830}Stow it. These things happen every day.
{67834}{67936}If you want to take it out on somebody,|take it out on the Japs, not yourself.
{67940}{67983}Come on. Let's get out of here.
{68105}{68204}It boils down to a matter of thickness.|The bomb is wedged in a tight spot.
{68208}{68266}And neither the captain|or I can get to it.
{68320}{68389}Back home, they used to call me "Slim."
{68393}{68431}You'll do, "Slim."
{68460}{68508}Take this and that off.
{68731}{68763}Your volunteer, captain.
{68792}{68836}Know what you're volunteering for?
{68840}{68882}Yes, sir. The bomb.
{68897}{68979}It's wedged under the superstructure.|That's not all.
{68983}{69087}That Jap may have radioed our position.|If planes come while we're down there...
{69091}{69146}...we'll have to drink a lot of water.
{69183}{69226}I'll go with you, captain.
{69256}{69324}Okay, Tommy. Get down below.
{69511}{69574}In case of another attack,|take her down.
{69615}{69652}Aye, aye, sir.
{69699}{69772}Clear the decks. Diving stations!
{70038}{70070}Son...
{70074}{70154}...that bomb may be a dud|because the firing pin's fractured.
{70158}{70229}If it is, the slightest jar|will set it off.
{70236}{70274}So take it very easy.
{70278}{70339}Here. You'll need this web wrench.
{70357}{70434}Tell me when you reach the bomb,|but don't touch it.
{71194}{71247}- Reached the bomb.|- Don't touch it yet.
{71251}{71318}Look carefully around|the base of the fuse.
{71330}{71424}The bomb may be a booby trap,|so it will blow up at the slightest touch.
{71438}{71547}Do you see any hammer marks|or slight indentations?
{71630}{71684}- No, captain.|- All right.
{71707}{71756}Now, very carefully...
{71760}{71792}...feel the nose.
{72132}{72168}Can you feel any marks?
{72195}{72227}No marks, sir.
{72231}{72276}Very gently now...
{72291}{72374}...place the web wrench|around the fuse.
{72443}{72504}It unscrews counterclockwise.
{72508}{72540}Right to left.
{72568}{72600}You got that?
{72604}{72641}Yes, sir. It's in place.
{72645}{72735}- It unscrews left to right, sir.|- Right to left! Right to left!
{72739}{72772}I'm sorry, sir.
{72776}{72832}I heard you all right.|I repeated it wrong.
{72836}{72888}Right to left, sir.|I'm a little nervous.
{72892}{72924}Stop and take a breath.
{72942}{72986}You're doing fine.
{73066}{73141}Well, I guess Mike|got it quicker, that's all.
{73145}{73184}Shut up.
{73188}{73260}- Talking don't bother a bomb.|- It bothers me.
{73345}{73441}Dakota, I once knew a dame who had|a temperament just like a bomb.
{73445}{73494}Laugh? No laugh.
{73506}{73584}Start unscrewing it gently.|Just use gradual pressure.
{73588}{73628}Right to left.
{73632}{73668}- Right.|- Easy.
{73672}{73722}Easy. Just loosen it.
{74033}{74096}- I've loosened it, sir.|- Now, carefully...
{74100}{74142}...remove the wrench.
{74161}{74207}Turn the fuse by hand.
{74342}{74380}Easy.
{74384}{74430}Very, very gently, son.
{74481}{74526}Easy does it.
{75237}{75305}Got "made in U.S.A." stamped on it.
{75349}{75414}The appeasers' contribution|to the war effort.
{75418}{75480}Take it and stew it, Cookie.
{75486}{75529}Adams, you did a fine job.
{75533}{75588}You earned yourself a higher rating.
{75592}{75628}Thank you, sir.
{75708}{75773}You got a great pair|of shoes to fill, Tommy.
{75963}{76016}One kid's shoe.
{76070}{76123}And one pipe...
{76127}{76160}...stem broken.
{76228}{76284}That completes the inventory.
{76491}{76551}Mike was a first-class|torpedoman...
{76555}{76599}...in more ways than one.
{76795}{76838}Where's the kid?
{76850}{76894}He went aft. He feels kind of low.
{76898}{76976}Wonder if we should have told|the exec about that package...
{76980}{77061}...Mike used to keep under his sack.|- What package?
{77072}{77105}Well...
{77109}{77169}...every time he borrowed|Yo Yo's office...
{77173}{77229}...he took it along with him.
{77412}{77471}Hey, maybe it's one|of them censored records.
{77475}{77524}Say, we could do with a laugh.
{77895}{77983}I thought Mike was acting|secret when he used to come in here.
{78158}{78193}Hello, honey.
{78197}{78277}I hope you play this record|once in a while while you're away.
{78281}{78342}It'll mean you're missing|me like I miss you...
{78346}{78417}... from the moment you shove off,|every single time.
{78421}{78540}Have I ever told you how much those|homecoming bear hugs mean to me?
{78544}{78652}Gosh, darling, you could break|all my ribs, having you back is so good.
{78676}{78764}The kids miss you and make believe|you're at the table each night.
{78795}{78865}I don 't think they know|what being married 10 years...
{78869}{78930}... to a sweet guy like you is like.
{78934}{78982}I do, thank God.
{78986}{79063}Means you've made me|the happiest woman alive.
{79086}{79147}I hope I've made you happy, Mike.
{79151}{79197}I always tried my darnedest...
{79201}{79235}... because I love you...
{79239}{79280}... with every bit of my heart.
{79826}{79880}"And whilst we consign...
{79884}{79946}...his remains to the deep...
{79950}{80046}...we the living|pray thee heavenly Father...
{80050}{80128}...to grant him eternal peace|and rest...
{80136}{80186}...through Christ Jesus, our Lord."
{80197}{80232}Amen.
{81062}{81110}Why weren't you up there?
{81181}{81220}I got no use for burials.
{81360}{81426}Oh, coffee's more important, huh?
{81540}{81616}- You don't think I care he's dead?|- Why didn't you come up?
{81620}{81703}- Sorry for that Jap?|- Shut up! I don't take that from nobody!
{81891}{81965}I'm surprised at you guys, all of you.
{81986}{82092}You ought to have sense enough|not to get such dumb ideas!
{82151}{82208}- I told you, I had my reasons.|- Bilge!
{82514}{82559}Look.
{82563}{82632}I had an uncle lived|in the old country, see.
{82636}{82703}A real high-class guy, not like me.
{82707}{82745}You know what he was?
{82749}{82803}He was a teacher of philosophy.
{82807}{82867}To be that in Greece,|the home of philosophy...
{82871}{82956}...you got to be A-number-one smart,|and that was my uncle.
{82960}{83000}So they killed him, them Nazis.
{83004}{83068}They stood him up against the wall.|You know why?
{83072}{83111}Because he had brains.
{83115}{83227}And everybody's got to be their slave.|Them that won't, like my uncle, they kill.
{83321}{83370}My old man was no good.
{83374}{83438}He was a boozer.|He died in bed having the D.T.'s.
{83472}{83549}But my uncle,|a man with education and charity...
{83553}{83609}...who used to send my ma|what to eat with.
{83613}{83703}Him, they stood up against the wall.|And that sticks in here with me.
{83707}{83755}The difference between|them and us...
{83759}{83871}...is, with us even the no-good|gets a chance to die in his own bed.
{83889}{83940}So I don't forget my uncle.
{83955}{84024}An American flier gets killed,|I think of my uncle.
{84028}{84114}I see pictures of Chinese kids|getting bombed, I think of my uncle.
{84118}{84184}A Russian guerrilla gets hanged,|I think of my uncle.
{84188}{84255}I see Mike lying in there dead,|I think of my uncle.
{84259}{84332}I ain't got room in here|to see one of our guys get buried.
{84336}{84407}Not yet. Not until I've done|something to even the score.
{84411}{84468}So I eat with it, and I sleep with it.
{84479}{84527}So be sore at me, you dopes.
{84620}{84680}- I'm sorry, Tin Can.|- Attention.
{84753}{84792}At ease, men.
{84916}{84972}- Trying to figure out about Mike?|- Yes, sir.
{85023}{85064}Well...
{85068}{85138}...officers and men on submarines|are closer together...
{85142}{85189}...than in most branches of our Navy.
{85193}{85239}Mike was with me on my first patrol.
{85252}{85316}He was my friend. I know his family.
{85328}{85400}His wife's a fine, great-hearted woman.
{85418}{85462}I know his kids.
{85496}{85623}I remember Mike's pride when he bought|the first pair of roller skates for his boy.
{85630}{85700}They were the finest roller skates|that money could buy.
{85711}{85752}Roller skates for a 5-year-old.
{85779}{85860}Well, that Jap got a present too,|when he was 5.
{85864}{85904}Only it was a dagger.
{85914}{86008}His old man gave him a dagger, so he'd|know what he was supposed to be.
{86012}{86072}The Japs have a ceremony|that goes with it.
{86076}{86184}At 7, a Jap kid is taking marches|under an army instructor.
{86188}{86272}At 13, he can put a machine|gun together blindfolded.
{86304}{86422}That Jap started on the road 20 years|ago to putting a knife in Mike's back.
{86478}{86537}There are lots of Mikes dying right now.
{86541}{86589}And a lot more Mikes will die...
{86593}{86720}...until we wipe out a system that puts|daggers in the hands of 5-year-olds.
{86739}{86779}You know...
{86783}{86843}...if Mike were here to put|it into words now...
{86847}{86905}...that's just about what he died for.
{86909}{86966}More roller skates in this world.
{86983}{87070}Including some for the next|generation of Japanese kids...
{87084}{87155}...because that's the kind|of a man Mike was.
{88176}{88257}- What's that you're reading?|- San Francisco telephone directory.
{88261}{88316}- I collect names.|- What do you do with them?
{88326}{88408}Just meditate. Wonder what kind|of people go with the names.
{88412}{88496}- Wonder what the names mean.|- Names don't mean nothing.
{88500}{88543}- Oh, no?|- No.
{88547}{88611}- Well, my name's Wainwright.|- Wainwright. So what?
{88615}{88721}My grandpa used to build wagons. A|wainwright's a guy who builds wagons.
{88725}{88776}- Like covered wagons?|- Sure.
{88780}{88846}Maybe he built some|wagons crossed the plains.
{88850}{88931}Some grandpas built houses.|Name's Carpenter.
{88935}{89009}Some grandpas made clothes.|Name's Tailor.
{89035}{89105}Some guy's grandpa built wheels|for my grandpa's wagons.
{89109}{89164}Name's Wheelwright,|a guy who builds wheels.
{89168}{89250}Sun lamp ready in the forward room.|Come on, GI sunshine.
{89254}{89332}Don't tell me the captain|finally gave up that sun lamp.
{89353}{89416}Phone books are fascinating.|I'm nuts about them.
{89420}{89478}Personally, I use phone books|for long shots.
{89482}{89555}In San Diego, I had nothing to do|and nothing on my mind...
{89559}{89592}Except skirts.
{89596}{89673}So I sees this phone book.|I flip it open. I come to a name.
{89677}{89710}Rosalie Riley.
{89714}{89797}"Pretty name," I says to myself.|"I wonder what she's like."
{89801}{89845}- So...|- So you call her up.
{89849}{89889}No. Why waste time?
{89893}{89964}I go right out to her house,|21 Valley Road.
{89968}{90029}Never forget it.|Had roses all over the place.
{90033}{90077}Very pretty. Very pretty indeed.
{90081}{90148}- Red and pink roses...|- Now we're going to pick roses.
{90152}{90247}I pick a rose. So I got something to talk|about when she comes to the door.
{90284}{90318}Up I go to the door.
{90322}{90422}I ring the bell. And I hear|a very nice voice from the inside.
{90426}{90496}"Wait a minute," she says.|"I'm in the bathtub."
{90500}{90556}Every girl you meet is in the bathtub!
{90560}{90631}I haven't met her yet. I'm on her porch!
{90645}{90696}Naturally, I sit down.
{90700}{90771}I'm rocking back and forth,|back and forth.
{90775}{90835}Skip the details.|Who cares if you're rocking?
{90839}{90900}I'm just trying to give you the picture!
{90931}{90964}We got the picture!
{90968}{91027}You're in the bathtub!|She's on the porch!
{91048}{91140}She's in the bathtub.|I'm on the porch!
{91172}{91242}She comes to the door.|My stomach flutters.
{91246}{91312}- She's beautiful!|- Now his stomach flutters.
{91338}{91436}"Oh," she says, "I thought you were|someone else. " "Disappointed?" I says.
{91440}{91484}You're there|with a snappy comeback.
{91488}{91538}She says,|"I can't ask you to come in."
{91542}{91646}"Of course not," I says, giving her pearly|teeth. "But I can ask you to come out."
{91650}{91685}What did she say to that?
{91689}{91756}Well, she didn't say anything,|that is, right away.
{91760}{91815}Then I proceeded to pour|on the personality.
{91819}{91858}Then what did you do?
{91866}{91917}Now, wouldn't you like to know?
{91921}{92000}You give me a pain in the pancreas.|You're always shooting off.
{92004}{92092}Stow it for the rest of this patrol.|Some of us have sweethearts.
{92096}{92172}Yeah?|Well, maybe some of us haven't.
{92240}{92283}Hasn't he been telling the truth?
{92287}{92402}No. You haven't been swallowing|all that stuff, have you?
{93519}{93562}Captain.
{93576}{93622}Oh, this it?
{93626}{93676}I'm afraid to take a look.
{93721}{93781}Just hope it won't be Coney Island.
{93796}{93852}Well, I got on my lucky sweater.
{94248}{94298}What's the bearing?
{94302}{94356}Zero-five-zero, captain.
{94743}{94819}Smack on the button. Take a look.
{94967}{95055}Right down Fujiyama's throat.
{95059}{95122}Nice work, Andy.|Check your tangents.
{95228}{95287}Lieutenant Raymond|to the conning tower.
{95328}{95375}Attention, all hands.
{95379}{95479}We're lying off the Japanese mainland.|Thought you'd like to know.
{95497}{95552}Just like the postcards, huh?
{95556}{95620}You get a better look inside the bay,|captain.
{95627}{95711}By the way, you think you can|get inside the net?
{95718}{95778}- That's what orders say.|- What about minefields?
{95782}{95852}- Can you see them underwater?|- Nope. I wish I could.
{95856}{95932}But if you do get in, how are you|going to get the ship out?
{95948}{96003}This is a sort of blind date, Raymond.
{96007}{96088}- We have to wait and see what happens.|- Got my tangents, captain.
{96092}{96163}Okay, Andy. Down scope.
{96196}{96274}We'll break out a chart|of the probable minefields.
{96279}{96387}Well, boys, looks as if|we have to wait for a ticket in.
{96499}{96580}This is going to be like waiting|to have your first tooth yanked.
{96613}{96669}Checking the gravity, captain.
{96723}{96804}How'd you happen to volunteer|for the submarine service, captain?
{96812}{96844}Well, when I was a kid...
{96848}{96924}...I used to get a kick|out of swimming underwater.
{96977}{97060}How's your wife feel about|your shoving off on these patrols?
{97067}{97136}The way the wives of all the men|in the services feel.
{97140}{97199}Did she know what she|was getting into?
{97203}{97240}Not when she met me.
{97244}{97302}She was a blind date.
{97310}{97370}Not quite the same as the date|we've got ahead.
{97374}{97435}It was dark. I couldn't see|what she looked like.
{97439}{97494}- You find out what she looked like?|- Yes.
{97498}{97568}You see, we have two kids by now.
{97594}{97647}I meant that night, sir.
{97651}{97689}No.
{97698}{97801}But I found you didn't need to know|what a girl looked like to like her.
{97808}{97901}I liked her voice, the things she said,|the way she laughed.
{97905}{97948}Still do.
{97956}{98024}I like the way she is with our kids.
{98046}{98094}I like everything about her.
{98118}{98178}What made you pick the Navy,|Raymond?
{98182}{98231}Well, I was born and raised in Tokyo.
{98235}{98280}Tokyo, Japan?
{98284}{98347}- You speak Japanese?|- Yes, he does.
{98351}{98422}- We expect to make good use of it soon.|- Let's hear some.
I hope you enjoy the hat, Mr. Stovall.
- And a pleasant voyage home to you.
- Well, thank you.
I'd like to thank you for something else too.
Back home, I'd buy a hat in five minutes.
- Thank you for a most enjoyable hour and 40 minutes.
- Come back soon, Mr. Stovall.
- Good-bye, sir.
- Where did you get this?
- An auction at Archbury, sir.
- I'll take it.
- That one's been
- I have a fine Staffordshire here...
- No, no, no. I'll take this one.
- How much?
- Only ten shillings, sir.
- I'm afraid it's not much value...
- Value? I want you
Very carefully.
As you say, sir.

[Coughing]
We can't go back.
We mustn't go back.
- Easy with his right leg. It's broken.
- I got it. I got it.
Easy now, easy now.
You have to hold him.
I've been sitting on him.
We can't. We just can't.
I wouldn't believe it if I wasn't looking at it. You can see his brain.
It was a 20 millimeter that hit him.
Step on it, Doc.
- What do I do with an arm, sir?
- An arm? Whose arm?
- Campbell's, the turret gunner's.
- What happened to the rest of him?
He's in a French hospital... I hope.
He couldn't have made it home.
It was blown off too close to put on a tourniquet so I bailed him out.
I put the ring in his good hand.
The chute opened.
That's all right.
I'll take care of it.
- Sergeant, get me a blanket out of that ambulance.
Come on.
I'll give you boys a lift.
- Hospital, Mac.
- Yes, sir.
Mac's had it.
Did you get the coordinates on a Fort and a Spitfire down in the Channel?
I've already passed them to Air Sea Rescue, sir.
That's it, gentlemen.
Thanks a lot.
Next crew.
- Take this one.
- Next crew.
Come on, Jesse.
- McKesson's crew.
- Right.
- McKesson coming?
- McKesson's dead.
Oh, I didn't know. I'm sorry.
Well, we might as well
Sit down.
Where did you first encounter enemy action?
- Bishop.
- Leave him alone.
Leave him alone, can't you?
What is it, Willie?
I don't know, sir.
Not all of it.
We got hit pretty bad the first pass the F.W. S made.
That was when Mac got it.
It took the back of his head right off.
Only he didn't pass out.
It just made a crazy man out of him.
He was still shouting orders... and trying to get the controls away from Jesse when I got
The kid had been flying with one hand... and trying to get the controls away from Mac with the other.
Wiping frozen blood off the windshield so he could see.
For two hours, sir.
He made a good bombing run too.
We unloaded on the target.
Didn't you know he was in trouble?
Why didn't somebody
The intercom was shot out and I thought it was
For two hours?
Mac's foot was jammed in the controls and... that's how we broke his leg trying to get it out of there.
That seemed to hurtJesse worst of all.
He started shaking and I...
I sat on Mac and held him... whileJesse brought us in.
Give me a copy of that, Fred, just the way he told it.
I'm sending it in with a recommendation for a Medal of Honor.
- Jesse will be okay.
I'll drop by later and see him.
- That's enough for this crew.
- That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
Next crew. Next crew.
[Men's Chorus On Radio]
Is he in there, Harvey?
No, he hasn't been in since right after interrogation.
Well, who wouldn't with today?
That's for you, Ben.
They're flying down three replacement aircraft.
Hmm. That's very, very nice of them.
Lose five, get three.
That's a nice gain, not
[Man On Radio]
This is Germany calling.
Lord Haw-Haw, talking from Berlin.
Today I want to bring a special greeting from the fiighter to the first American pilots in England, the Eighth Air Force.
That's all we need. Our submarines checked you very carefully... when you flew across from America... four groups in place so far.
Too bad about the ones who you lost on the way.
But we wanted to let you know... that a U-boat picked up the crew and they're quite safe here.
We found them quite agreeably talkative too.
But what we want to know...
Whoever persuaded you to try this incredible idea of daylight bombing?
It must have been your friends, the English.
They know better than to try it themselves.
Losses are a little heavy, aren't they?
- Let's take the 918th group at Archbury, for instance.
The hard-luck group. You lost fiive bombers today, didn't you?
Five out of the one group.
Let's see, 21 in a group?
At that rate, it won't take very long, will it?
Something pleasant to think about before your mission tomorrow.
Yes, Colonel Keith Davenport.
You'll have another one tomorrow.
Pleasant dreams, my misguided friends.
I don't know why we listen to him.
It's always the same pitch... we've already lost the war.
On a day like this, I could find myself believing him.
What was today's count on crews?
Five crews didn't make it back.
Three killed, 11 wounded out of those who did.
A lot of letters to write.
I'm glad I don't have that one.
- Did you hear about Lord Haw-Haw?
- Twice on the way over here.
That kind of news moves fast.
Don't let a Kraut newshound
He was right about one thing.
We're alerted for tomorrow.
- Again tomorrow? You're kidding, Ben.
- I wish I were, sir.
Fine, fine.
Four days in a row.
Well, we'd better start getting things together.
- Alert the crews and I'll see you in the ops room.
- This will make you happy.
Flak City again.
It's either a feast or a famine.
Chew your nails off for three and then cram a month's bombing into four days.
Must be an easier way to run a war.
Field order's snafued too.
It says here 9,000 feet.
That's a mistake. I'm sure they mean
19,000. I'll check with Savage.
Another maximum effort.
What have you got in the way of weather?
I wish I could, but the target area ought to be C.A.V.U.
About three tenths cloud cover over the Channel. Ideal almost.
- You're no good to me. Let me know if there's any change.
How many airplanes have we got left?
With the three new ones and working the crews all night,
- How many are the other groups putting up?
We'd better camp on Nero's tail.
No, if he says 18, he's giving us everything with wings on it.
What did the other groups lose today?
Two in the 916th, zero in the others.
Our stinking luck. Those flak gunners had the range good
- What about crews, Doc?
- I could give you a couple
I'd better get started on routes and timings.
- No coffee, Ben?
- Oh, not now, thanks.
That's getting to be your diet, isn't it? That and cigarettes?
How long since you've had your clothes off?
Never mind my pants, what about crews?
You're crew, when it comes to my certifying you for a mission.
There's the crew availability.
Colonel, about the route and timing of tomorrow's mission?
Start on the routes. But I wouldn't figure on that 9,000-foot altitude...
- until Colonel Davenport checks with Pinetree.
Thanks for worrying about me, Doc, only don't.
What about the rest of them?
That brings us to the two answers.
On that list are 28 men asking to be excused three times more than normal.
They give a lot of reasons, colds mostly, and most of them
And that doesn't mean that they've suddenly gone yellow.
It just means that they're getting their bellies full.
Now, do I okay them physically and mark them "duty"?
How much can a man take?
What's physical and what isn't?
The rules say a man ought to go right up to the point
I wish I knew what that meant.
If I did, I'd tell you.
Well, can you tell me this... do I okay Bishop for tomorrow?
He had a tough deal.
Jesse's a tough boy.
How tough? What happened today must have done something to him inside.
It had to have cost him something.
Somebody's got to give me a policy, some kind of yardstick.
I wish you'd tell me what a "maximum effort" means.
Doc, I wish I knew.
I wish I could answer that one.
[Phone Rings]
Hello. Yes.
Hello, Pinetree. All right.
Frank, Keith Davenport.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard it.
Look, Frank, I didn't call up to talk about Lord Haw-Haw.
What about that cockeyed field order that came down that said 9,000?
What? Oh, you're kidding.
Yeah, but the strike photos don't show what the flak is like in there.
Listen, are you gonna be there a little while?
All right. I'll be right up.
They meant 9,000. Maybe when I get back
I can give you an answer, Doc.
No, no mistake.
It's 9,000.
Well, we've got to try it.
We're not getting hits
Yeah, I know. Then twist it.
Had the same request all day.
The Wailing Wall is just around the corner, Keith.
Oh, I don't know.
I guess this is it. Sit down.
If you're on the level about this 9,000 foot stuff, the boys will drop their bombs here tomorrow instead of St. Nazaire.
- Look, Frank...
- It won't work. It was tough at
The guy who dreamed this one up ought to have his brain
- Anything else?
- You're kidding?
You've been a group commander.
You didn't lead the first
- Why couldn't you tell them what it'll be like? You...
I signed the field order.
Why? That's what
I want to know.
All right, I'll spell it for you.
We haven't been penetrating the concrete in those sub-pens, Keith.
We can't get concentration and accuracy from 19,000.
We've got to go in once down low to see if we can instead of fighting our way to the target five times
Nine thousand feet.
Let's allow from here in that when the old man cuts a field
There isn't time to take every one of them apart to see what makes it tick.
If I were you, when I got one,
I'd just go ahead and fly it.
I was gonna bring these down to you tomorrow.
I had to steal them from the RAF.
Hope they're the kind you wanted.
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks, Frank.
I won't need them at 9,000 though. It'll be plenty hot.
Well, I better get on back and get the chores done.
Stay put a minute now you're here.
Thought I might run down tomorrow to see you.
Eighteen.
- Pretty bad luck today?
- Not good.
We had one break through the runway at takeoff.
That threw us late.
We never made it up.
It cost us plenty.
I don't know how anybody outguesses that one.
No.
I'd like to help you locate where the trouble does lie, if I could.
What about your formation?
I can tell you where the real trouble is, Frank. And it isn't formation.
- Shoot.
- It isn't down in the groups either.
It's up here, where a bunch of boys get to be nothing but a set of numbers.
That's what's the trouble.
Do they know up here what my boys have been taking for three days in a row?
That they'll be up all night to get 18 in the air for tomorrow?
How much do you think they can take?
You know they're falling
- Are you gonna drive them till they crack?
Take it easy?
Bomber Command can take it easy.
They'll die for you, but they've got to have a chance and they
Frank, they can add. They know a man's chances run out in 15 missions.
Somebody's gotta give them a limit, a goal, some hope of living.
What do you think they're made of?
- Look, Keith.
- [Buzzes]
- Yes, sir?
- I just got the reports from
I'll be there in a minute, sir.
Those things are coming, Keith.
Replacements, combat limits.
But right now the deal is to hang on.
And look, Keith, you've got to find a way to save yourself a little.
You can't carry all the load. It's too big.
Don't worry about me.
If you want something to worry
You and the old man.
You better go on up and see him.
- Give him my love.
- If I do, he'll send you his.
He rates you pretty high.
Not according to Lord Haw-Haw.
Good night, Frank.
Never mind the reasons.
There it is and you can't
Five missing today and they'll only put up 18 tomorrow.
- It's getting worse instead of better.
- Yes, sir.
I've just been talking to Keith.
He's low enough about it.
What really happened today?
Did he tell you?
No, I didn't dig into it.
He had tomorrow ahead of him.
What do you make of it?
Hard luck, I guess. There's always some outfit that picks up a jinx.
You don't believe that.
Fill yourself a drink.
Thanks.
It might scare off that bug of yours.
I don't believe in hard luck.
There's always a reason.
What have you got on your mind,
Frank? Spill it.
I'd rather not.
Let's have it with the bark on.
You won't like it. I don't.
It's the group commander.
Keith?
It's always the group commander.
It's his job, isn't it?
A little funny, coming from you.
He's your friend.
I didn't ask you to ask me.
- I didn't mean it to sound like that, Frank.
I don't believe it though.
I don't think I do.
On paper, Keith looked to me like the best group commander we've had.
He's flown every mission. He gets more loyalty out of his men than anybody.
Courage, he works hard.
I don't know where to fault him.
If a man like that can't cut it, we're in trouble.
- What happened downstairs to change the picture for you?
Added this to it though.
He's gonna bust wide open.
And he's gonna do it to himself too.
Why? Because he's a first-rate guy.
Because those are his boys and he's thinking about them instead of missions.
Over-identification with his men.
I think that's what they call it.
And you aren't going to change it either.
I can't buy it, Frank.
Not yet anyway.
Is Keith still here?
No, he had tomorrow to get ready for.
I'll give you that much, we'd better find out.
If it's true, we're in trouble.
Why should the other groups hold together if the 918th can't?
Call my car, will you, Frank, while I get my pants on.
You mean you want me to go down there with you?
You bet I do.
It's your idea.
We were three minutes late on the target and got most of it
That was a deadly three minutes, Keith.
The idea was to get all the groups over the target simultaneously... so that enemy flak couldn't concentrate on any one group.
We sure were sitting ducks out there alone. Maybe I
But we were there and
I figured the boys wouldn't want
No man makes a perfect plan.
You couldn't foresee a plane
Maybe the mistake lay in not going on to the secondary
But I figured we could make up the time, catch up with the other groups.
- We could have too if it hadn't been for our stinking luck.
- It wasn't luck, sir. It was my fault.
- It wasn't anybody's fault.
- I'd like to hear the lieutenant's version.
We had to alter the navigation in flight, sir,
We picked up an error... wind change.
And I missed a checkpoint here at St. Lo.
By the time I had caught it, here at Rennes, it had cost us three minutes and we never made it up.
If there's any fault, it's mine.
I was in command. I ordered
- The weather was thick enough.
Could have happened to anyone.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you, gentlemen.
- Zimmy.
- Yes, sir.
It's okay.
Don't worry about a thing.
Keith, I know you're tired, but let's talk a little.
Sit down.
Let's talk about luck.
A pretty critical three minutes, Keith.
- Five crews, 50 men.
- Do you think I don't know?
- I know you do.
Whose fault was it, Keith?
- Were you flying?
- Yes, sir.
- Do you fly and navigate or do you rely on your navigator?
- It was the lieutenant's fault.
- He missed the check point, but
I know and I'll allow he feels as rotten about it
But what happens now, Keith?
I don't understand you, sir.
We're talking about luck.
I don't believe in it.
I believe that to some degree a man makes his own luck.
Yours has been pretty bad down here and it's getting worse, not better.
Maybe the navigator's in point.
He blew it. What are you going
General, I don't believe in chopping off heads because of one mistake.
Well, I just don't think that's any way to run a group.
I feel sorry for the boy, Keith.
But what are the men in your group going to be thinking about
That he messed up the St. Nazaire mission.
It's just that much more load on them. And one day, if they
There isn't a man in the outfit who wouldn't stake his life on Zimmy.
General, if it was anyone but him. He's got two strikes
You don't realize. That boy's got a persecution complex.
He wants to fly every mission trying to live down the fact... that his parents were mixed up in the German-American Bund.
They screened Zimmy plenty before he ever got overseas.
Keith, good navigators is the one thing we're not short of.
If you decide that you ought to relieve this boy, I'll
You might as well ask me to stand him up against the wall
No, I won't do it, sir. I just can't do it to him. I won't.
Keith, I want you to get to bed.
Have the flight surgeon give you a shot that will make you sleep 24 hours.
I guess a man only has so much to give and I guess you've given it.
Effective now, you are relieved of this command... and you will report to me for duty at Bomber Command.
I'll send someone down to take over here.
- Good night, Keith.
- Good night, sir.
Major, the 918th will stand down until a new commanding officer arrives.
Yes, sir.
[Door Shuts]
- Want me to take it, sir?
- No.
I want to talk, Frank.
There's a hole in the dike, Frank.
I'm scared stiff.
Maybe you know how deep all this goes, and maybe you don't.
I've got to spill it anyhow.
We're fighting all over the world.
Every theater commander is screaming for crews and equipment.
Fifty thousand airplanes, that's what they say they're building.
I wish we had 500.
Our problem right now narrows down to one group.
If the 918th folds, it can spread to the other three groups.
It can fold the whole deal.
There's only one hope of shortening this war... daylight precision bombing.
If we fold, daylight bombing is done with.
I don't know. Maybe it means the whole show.
We could lose the war if we don't knock out German industry.
You can smell what's coming, Frank.
I'm promising you nothing except a job no man should have to do
I've gotta ask you to take nice kids and fly them
And then put them back in and fly them some more.
We've got to find out what a maximum effort is.
How much a man can take and get it all.
[Sighs] I don't even know if any man can do it.
That's what cracked Keith.
What time do you think you can get down there tomorrow?
Early, I guess.
No squawks?
Pretty hard to have one, the way you put it.
Thanks, Frank.
- Smoke, Ernie?
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- Do you know me, soldier?
- No, sir.
- Then why are you admitting me to this station?
Goering could have been in it.
- Here's my A.G.O. Card.
- The general may proceed, sir.
Soldier, this is a military post, not a zoo.
From now on, you'll check everyone who enters and without exception.
Take a good look at me.
If you or any man on this post passes me up without saluting you'll wonder what fell on you.
- You might pass that word around.
- Yes, sir.
- Locate my quarters and drop my bags off.
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks, Ernie.
[Man Humming, Typing]
- [Whistling]
- How do I address you?
I don't think
I quite understand the general, sir.
What's your rank?
How am I supposed to know?
Sergeant McIllhenny, sir,
U.S. Army Air Forces.
It's Private McIllhenny now.
Where's the air exec?
I... I don't think he's on the station, sir.
He left right after
Lieutenant Zimmerman's funeral.
- Zimmerman?
- Yes, sir. Navigator, sir.
- And what happened to him?
- Suicide, sir.
- Where's the ground exec?
- In the hospital, sir, mumps.
- And the adjutant?
- I think maybe Major Stovall's
When you get your clothes on, find him and ask him to report to me here.
Yes, sir.
[Knock On Door]
[Knock On Door]
Major Stovall, sir,
Group Adjutant.
- Yes, I remember you, Major.
You the only one around?
- I presume you've come down to take over the group.
- Have you been drinking, Major?
- I have.
It's the first time
I've been drunk in 20 years, but it may not be the last.
- Where's the air exec?
- I don't know, sir.
It's only an opinion, but I think it's possible he may be drunk too, sir.
- I'll take straight answers,
Major. Is he off the station?
- Where?
- I don't know that, sir.
Send the M.P. S out and find him and bring him to me under arrest.
- Does the general mean under actual arrest?
Two... cancel all leaves and passes... and make sure that all squadron commanders are back here by tonight.
Three... bring me the personnel files, the 66-1 's on Gately and the key staff...
- including yours.
- Yes, sir.
Four... set up a meeting for all combat crews... in the briefing room tomorrow morning at 0800.
- Is that all, sir? Yes, sir.
- That's all.
- Colonel Gately is here, sir.
- Send him in.
Yes, sir.
That's all, men.
- May I ask the general why
I've been placed under arrest?
Stand at attention.
You're the son of Lieutenant
General Tom Gately, aren't you?
I believe that's my standard identification, sir.
- What do you think of him as an officer?
That's right.
You're the son of one fine officer and the grandson of another.
You're a graduate of West Point with nine years service.
You're form five shows that you have more four engine time
For those reasons, you could've done more than anybody to take
The record shows that you've flown only three missions
- Is that right?
- If you don't count twice
I take it that you don't even care about the part you had... in breaking one of the best men you'll ever know.
Add to it as air exec you were automatically in command here... the moment
Colonel Davenport left.
And you met that responsibility exactly as you met his need.
You ran out on it.
You left the station to get drunk.
And Gately, as far as I'm concerned, you're yellow.
A traitor to yourself, to this group, to the uniform you wear.
It would be the easiest course for me to transfer you out, to saddle some unsuspecting guy with a deadbeat.
Maybe you think that's what you're gonna get out of this,
But I'm not gonna pass the buck.
I'm gonna keep you right here.
I hate a man like you so much that I'm gonna get your head
I'm gonna make you wish you'd never been born.
- If that's all, sir...
- I'm just getting started.
You're gonna stay right here and get a bellyful of flying.
You're going to make every mission.
You're not air exec anymore.
You're just an airplane commander.
And I want you to paint this name on the nose of your ship...
Leper Colony.
Because in it you're gonna get every deadbeat in the outfit.
Every man with a penchant for head colds.
If there's a bombardier who can't hit his plate with his fork, you get him.
If there's a navigator who can't find the men's room, you get him.
Because you rate him.
- Is that clear?
- General Savage, I have a right for personal abuse and exceeding your lawful authority...
Hello, get me Pinetree.
I want General Pritchard.
- The line's busy, sir. Will you wait?
- Yeah, I'll wait.
Rights, Gately?
You've got a right to explain to General Pritchard cowardice, desertion of your post, a yellow streak a mile wide.
And maybe he can explain it to your father so they'll both be proud of you.
- Hello. Hello?
- You can tell him right now.
Hello, I have your line, sir.
- General Savage,
I withdraw my statement.
- Hello, I have your line, sir.
- Never mind.
That's all then.
- Cut an order relieving
Colonel Gately as air exec.
Anybody else, sir?
I'll let you know, Major.
There's one file there,
Cobb, Squadron Commander,
What are his personal qualifications?
I'm sure the general will be pleased with any selection
Thanks for the help, Major.
- I'll be around the station.
- Yes, sir.
Sir.
- I've been assigned as the general's driver.
- Aren't you the clerk that I saw...
- Yes, sir. Private McIllhenny.
Well, general officers rate sergeants as drivers.
- Better put those stripes back on.
- Yes, sir.
With anyone else but me
Anyone else but me
Anyone else but me
- No, no, no don't sit under the apple tree
- Yes, sir.
- With anyone else but me
Till I come marching home
Don't go walking down lovers' lane with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me
Anyone else but me
No, no, no don't go walking down lovers'lane
Remove your cap in the club, Major.
- That's regulations, huh?
- It is.
Have another,
Major Cobb.
Scotch.
- I've got it.
- No regulation against
That's right.
- Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
- This bar is closed for tonight and until further notice.
[Men Chattering, Indistinct]
I'll probably see you tomorrow morning.
- Good night, Ben.
- Good night. I'll keep a light
Come in.
Major Stovall, cut an order assigning Major Cobb as air exec.
Yes, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
[Chattering]
- [Footsteps Approaching]
- Attention.
Rest.
There will be a briefing for a practice mission at 1100 this morning.
That's right, practice.
I've been sent here to take over what has come to be known
Well, I don't believe in hard luck.
So we're going to find out
Maybe part of it's your flying, so we're going back to fundamentals.
But I can tell you now one reason
I think you've been having hard luck.
I saw it in your faces last night.
I can see it there now.
You've been looking at a lot of air lately... and you think you ought to have a rest.
In short, you're sorry for yourselves.
I don't have a lot of patience with this what are we fighting for stuff.
We're in a war, a shooting war.
We've got to fight.
And some of us have got to die.
I'm not trying to tell you not to be afraid. Fear is normal.
But stop worrying about it and about yourselves.
Stop making plans.
Forget about going home.
Consider yourselves already dead.
Once you accept that idea, it won't be so tough.
Now if any man here can't buy that, if he rates himself as something special, with a special kind he'd better make up his mind about it right now.
Because I don't want him in this group.
I'll be in my office in five minutes.
You can see me there.
Attention!
- [Man #1] I'll take
Colonel Davenport any day.
I'd better get over to the office 'cause the traffic is gonna be pretty heavy.
[Door Closes]
The air exec and the group flight surgeon are here, sir.
- Tell them to come in.
- Yes, sir.
They beat you to it, Major.
I thought you'd be the first one
- No, sir.
- Well, it wouldn't
- Doesn't go for staff.
You're stuck with me.
- You might tell them.
- They thought you'd want to see
- Good.
- Yes, sir.
For the general's information, I think you'll find Major Kaiser a top man.
Thorough, knows his job, honest.
I think Cobb's an excellent man too.
It's just he's a little too frank.
- Thanks, Major.
- Yes, sir.
- General, this is Major Kaiser.
- I'm glad to see you, Doc.
- And I think you met Major Cobb.
- Indeed I have.
General, I don't know if you still want me here after last night.
No need to tell you,
I was stiff.
Well, stiff or not, you laid it on the line.
You got the job after I saw you at the club, not before.
You were in the briefing room.
You still want it?
I think I can cut it for you, sir.
See you at takeoff.
Now, what about the crew availability, Major?
We have a very critical morale problem, General.
You gave them the shock treatment this morning, a bucket of cold water.
I take it that's the key in which you want me to approach the problem... as to how much stress they can take.
If a man is physically capable of handling his airplane, he goes.
Well, that's definite enough.
But some things can't be accomplished just by issuing an order.
- Have you seen the sick reports?
- Yeah, I've seen them.
Our sick reports indicate something else to me.
Besides the normal stress of a lot of flying, these men have had the breaking up of a strong personal attachment.
They were devoted to Colonel Davenport.
- He was the main thing they had to hold on to.
Yes.
Ease up.
Give them a chance to get used to you.
Give them a chance to get used to you.
No, Major.
For two reasons.
First, there isn't time.
Second, I can't enter a popularity contest with Keith Davenport.
I'd lose that one.
And one more thing, I think they're better than that.
All right, sir.
That's it.
Lieutenant Bishop to see you, sir.
- Bishop? Who's he?
- A pilot, sir.
Yesterday a recommendation for the Medal of Honor was
- Oh, yes. I'll see him in just a minute.
I think I know how deep the problem is here, Major.
And I'm convinced that the one thing that will solve it is pride, pride in this group.
The kind of pride that will make it the last thing a man
And that's my job, not yours.
- Paint it with iodine and mark them "duty," Doc.
- Yes, sir.
- Send Bishop in.
Yes, sir.
I better practice saluting you,
Lieutenant. That goes with the medal.
- It was a privilege to add my name to that recommendation.
- Sit down, Bishop.
- Thank you, sir, but...
- Well, first, I better tell you why I'm here.
The pilots asked me to be their spokesman, sir.
They want to transfer out.
- How many of them?
- All of them, sir.
Well, I can see why they sent you, Bishop.
You make quite a spokesman.
Have you thought this out?
You're sure that's the way you feel?
I... I think so, sir.
All right, that's it. Tell them to put their requests through channels.
Meanwhile, they fly.
- That's all then?
- Yes, sir.
[Intercom Buzzes]
- Yes?
- I just made some coffee.
- Shall I bring it in?
- Thanks, Major.
I'll come out there and get it.
What are you doing?
Personal effects of boys who got it to be sent to next of kin.
I'm a little behind.
I always write a letter.
It always takes time to screen the stuff pretty well.
It might save somebody back home getting hurt unnecessarily.
That's a tough chore.
I don't envy you.
How did you happen to get into paperwork?
They didn't give me any choice.
See, I'm... I'm a retread.
I had my shot at combat in the first war.
Of course I kind of wanted to get into this one, but I guess they figured
I was too old for anything but a desk.
Maybe they were right.
You, uh...
You liked Keith Davenport, didn't you? A lot, I mean.
Yes, sir.
I thought he was one of the finest men I ever knew.
The same way the boys felt, I'm sure.
Loyalty is a fine thing.
Well.
- Thanks for the coffee, Major.
- General Savage.
I'd like to tell you something else, I think.
[Clears Throat]
I'm a lawyer by trade.
I think I'm a good one.
And when a good lawyer takes on a client, he does it because... he believes in the client's case, and that's all that matters.
When I came over to England
I took on my biggest client.
That client is the 918th Bomb Group.
I want to see my client win its case.
Does that answer what you had in mind?
- On the button.
- What did you have in mind exactly?
I need time before those transfers go through.
- Mm-hmm. How much time?
- As much as we can get.
Ten days, anyway.
Well, it'll take those squadron adjutants... at least two days to draw up all those requests.
And, let's see...
I believe in thorough, methodical work, everything in order.
I've got a good deal of stuff on my desk here.
So, it might be three days before I could get around to them.
- That's five.
- Take a couple of days to check them.
That's seven.
And those squadron adjutants are pretty sloppy sometimes, and I certainly don't want this group criticized for sloppy paperwork.
- Do you, General?
- Couldn't permit it.
So my guess is every one of those requests... may have to go back to the squadron adjutants to be done over.
By the time I recheck them, it'll be ten days anyway before they can be ready for signature.
What a way to run an outfit.
- You red-tape adjutants are all alike.
- That's right, sir.
But Harvey, there can be trouble in this.
I don't think so, sir. I never heard of a jury convicting the lawyer.
Let me have your attention.
Now, in case any of you aren't clear as to what this is all about,
I'm supposed to be a deadbeat.
And so are you.
That's why you were assigned to me...
"The Leper Colony."
How do you like it?
Well, you'll like it a lot less the first mistake you make.
We've got a blowtorch turned our way, and nobody's gonna shove me into it.
- Is that clear?
- [Vehicle Approaching]
- Everything set?
- Yes, sir.
You fly. I'll ride in the top turret where I can see.
- Radio, rig an extension to the top turret...
- So the general can talk on the command set.
All right.
Let's go.
"Close it up.
Close it up. Closer.
Shove that there wingtip right in his lap."
Sweet Savannah!
That wingtip of Baxter's been tickling me... right in the ribs for three days now, man.
- I'm gettin' mighty tired of it.
- That's a-tellin' 'em, Birdy.
Yeah, and another thing
I noticed.
For folks that talks about other people's ability as a pilot, that there general seems mighty willin' not to do any of it hisself.
Hmph. Looks like we just got ourselves a talking general.
"Stack it in there, now."
[Continues, Indistinct]
- [Water Splashing]
- We're alerted, sir!
Field orders coming in now.
Tell Cobb to wheel and deal.
I'll be right over.
Operator. Operator.
Keep this line clear.
I've got 24 fast calls for you.
Get me the bomb dump and hurry.
[Men] Bless them all
Bless them all
Oh, the long and the short and the tall
Let's bless all the blondies and all the brunettes
For each lad is happy to take what he gets
'Cause we're...
Two missions.
Only one aircraft lost.
Very little battle damage.
That's because most of the time we flew good, tight formation.
Those enemy fighters took one look... and didn't want any part of the 918th.
The bad side... the bombing.
Fair. Particularly, the Low Squadron.
That means we start dropping practice bombs every day that
- Cobb?
- Yes, sir.
- That's your baby.
- Roger.
Anybody got any comment?
Well, I've got some more.
Hanley!
- Here, sir.
- Those strike photos show... that you've been toggling late with your bombs the last two missions.
- What's your reason?
- No excuse, sir.
Well, I'll say this for you, Hanley, you're honest.
But nine men risked their lives to ride with you... in order to put bombs on a target!
Gately, here's a new bombardier for you.
- Pettinghill!
- Yes, sir.
We're plenty lucky to have only one loss on this strike.
Well, sir,
Ackerman was in trouble...
Two engines on fire, and we were getting enemy fighters. I...
I figured I'd better stay back and try to cover him... going into the target, but he couldn't make it.
Ackerman a pretty good friend of yours?
My roommate, sir.
So for the sake of your roommate you violated group integrity.
Every gun on a B-17 is designed... to give the group maximum defensive firepower.
That's what I mean by group integrity.
When you pull a B-17 out of a formation, you reduce the defensive power of the group by ten guns.
A crippled airplane has to be expendable.
The one thing which is never expendable is your obligation to this group!
This group.
This group.
That has to be your loyalty, your only reason for being.
- Stovall.
- Yes, sir.
Have the billeting officer work out a reassignment of quarters...
- so that every man has a new roommate.
- Gately!
- Yes, sir.
Baxter is promoted out of the Leper Colony.
Pettinghill's your new copilot.
Well, that's all I've got.
Anybody got anything else they want to bring up?
What about our transfers, sir?
- Okay, if that's all, dismissed.
- Attention!
- [Knocking]
- [Savage] Come in.
Keith! Come on in.
Glad to see you.
How are you, Frank?
How's the adjutant business, Harvey?
Just went out of that line of work, sir.
Ground exec now.
- Well, glad to hear it.
You had it coming.
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you, Harvey.
- Piece of cake?
- Thanks.
Uh, birthday.
It's a little old.
Oh, many happy returns.
Well, seems to me
I've seen this joint before.
It looks better with you in it, Keith.
Have a drink.
Say, you're in time for chow.
- The boys'll be glad to see you.
- I'm not so sure of that.
I saw Sergeant Keller at the gate.
- Had to show my A.G.O. Card to get in.
And I'll pass up the supper, I guess.
I just dropped down for a minute.
I had something I wanted to talk to you about, Frank.
Well, I'll get on about my ground exec-ing.
- I'll see you before you go, Keith.
- All right.
- Nice guy, Harvey.
- First-rate.
Sit down.
Aah, tastes good.
Gets the chill out of your bones.
- What a stinkin' climate.
- It's pretty bad.
Only I guess you didn't come down to talk about the weather.
No...
Or maybe I did at that.
- There's a storm coming, Frank.
- The old man?
No. I don't know if he even knows about it.
There's been a lot of talk about requests for transfer,
- Have you been sittin' on 'em?
- I have.
You've got what amounts to a mutiny on your hands.
There's a rumor that the inspector general's got hold of it.
If he investigates you, you're cooked.
Can you slow him down?
You know the Old Man can't interfere with the I.G.
I know what you're after... a little time, get a few maybe the boys'll change their minds.
- But it won't work that way.
- You got any ideas?
Well, to be perfectly frank about it, when you took command,
I was hoping you'd fail, fall flat on your face.
I'm that human.
So now, me, the guy who blew it...
- wants to tell you how to run this group.
All right.
You're blowing it too.
You can't drive those boys.
I told you once before... they can't just be a set of numbers, and it still goes.
The fact that I blew it doesn't mean that idea was wrong.
I figured it was me.
I wasn't good enough.
You've got to help them, Frank.
You've got to take the time to win something from them,
And that'll be a worse failure than mine ever was.
Give them something to lean on, you mean.
Call it anything you like.
Well, Keith,
I don't believe it.
Here's where you and I part company.
I don't think they're boys, they're men.
Too bad they have to find out so young.
How old is Bishop?
Twenty-one, maybe.
It's pretty tough to have to grow all the way up at 21.
But that's the only way we're gonna get the job done.
And I think they can do it too.
Lean on somebody?
I think they're better than that.
And if that's not true then we're a dead duck, and we'd better find out about it right now, once and for all.
Well, that's that.
You called the turn for me once, and I couldn't see it.
Now we're even.
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, Keith.
[Men] The stars at night are big and bright
- [Hand Claps]
- Deep in the heart of Texas
- The prairie skies...
- [Man] Not again.
[Teletypes Clattering]
No good, sir. Acknowledgement from the other groups,
- But nothing from the 918th.
- Forget code.
- Try to reach him in the clear.
- Yes, sir.
Pinetree to Flashlight leader.
Pinetree to Flashlight leader.
This is a recall.
Do you read me?
Pinetree to Flashlight leader.
Pinetree to Flashlight leader.
This is a recall.
Do you read me? Over.
- Nothing, sir.
- I don't get it.
Weren't all commanders told to guard channel "B" because
- It was in the field order, sir.
- Well... something's happened.
They've gone on to the target alone.
I'm going down there, Keith.
I can't just stand here and take it.
That's 21, sir.
They're all back.
Well, that's something.
I'm glad we still have miracles.
Well, we had a little weather, sir, but the target area had cleared off just long enough...
- for the 918th to clobber it good.
- What about the recall?
- Recall, sir? What recall?
Never heard it.
- Must have had radio malfunction.
- I see.
- Let's get up to your office, Frank.
- Yes, sir.
- The bar's open, Harvey.
The boy's really earned it.
[Pritchard] And you think I'm going to buy a quick Persian rug... about a radio malfunction?
And I suppose you'll tell me next the weather was just bad enough...
- You didn't see the other groups turn back.
You've got no right to gamble like that. Not with my money.
It isn't enough that
I have to hold still while you graft... an inspector general on my rump.
I've managed to live without inspector generals for 20-some years.
And don't think you can justify this by the fact that
No, sir.
I didn't hear a thing.
It must have been radio malfunction.
- Do you mean you're going to stick to that fairy tale?
There's one more thing you might as well know, sir.
The 918th got through today, and bombed the target when nobody else did.
And if Providence ever drops into my lap, another chance like that to give this group the pride
I may have radio malfunction again, sir.
And there's one more thing.
I'm asking you for a commendation for this group, for their aggressiveness, skill and courage... in reaching and bombing a target under extremely adverse conditions.
And you don't need to mention their leadership, sir.
All right, Frank, you'll get it.
And maybe someday I'll send you one for leadership, I don't know.
- Got somebody around here that can take dictation?
- McIllhenny, bring a book and pencil in here.
Come on. Hurry up.
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Relax, Harvey.
Mission accomplished.
[Men]
Poor little lambs
Who have lost our way
Baa, baa, baa
- What do you make of it, Harvey?
- I don't know.
They're pleased about the commendation, I think, but... they're not celebrating the way kids ought to.
It's not normal.
- Baa, baa, baa
- No cries for Savage
I don't know.
Get ahold ofJesse Bishop.
- Tell him I'd like to see him in my quarters.
- Smoke, Bishop?
- No, thank you, sir.
I wanted to talk with you, Bishop,
- because I know you'll level with me.
- Yes, sir.
I wish you'd try to tell me what you're feeling.
- Right now. Right this minute.
- About what, sir?
The transfers. The fact this group showed the rest
Whether you're proud of that.
Sir, I don't think I have any right to speak for the rest...
Then, don't speak for the rest of them, just you.
Well, sir, that's hard. I...
I don't know how I feel.
That's...
That's kind of the trouble.
What is?
Well, the... the whole thing, sir.
Everything.
I can't see what good we're doing with our bombing, and all the boys getting killed.
Just a handful of us.
It's like we...
We're some kind of guinea pigs, only we're not proving anything.
You've got to have confiidence in something.
And then, when you find something you've got confidence in... then everything changes.
It just doesn't make any sense, I don't know.
I just want out.
Well, do you think it'll be any better in another group?
It isn't a question of that, sir.
I don't want to fly anymore.
I want to transfer to another branch.
Doesn't it mean anything to you that we hit the target today with no losses?
Yes, sir.
I suppose so... in a way.
But I just want out.
Well... that's a... pretty tough request... from a Medal of Honor man.
Sure, we're guinea pigs,
Jesse.
But there's a reason.
If we can hang on here now... one day soon... somebody's gonna look up... and see a solid overcast of American bombers... on the way to Germany to hit the Third Reich where it lives.
Maybe we won't be the ones to see it. I can't promise you that.
But I can promise you that they'll be there... if only we can manage to make the grade now!
I'd like to believe you, sir.
I just don't have confidence in anything anymore.
Well... looks like I'm choppin' and no chips are flyin'.
It's easy to transfer out of a group, Jesse.
It's pretty hard for a man to transfer out of his obligation.
But then every man has to play it the way he sees it.
- Well, good night, Jesse.
- Good night, sir.
- How is it going?
- Beats me.
The inspector's got every pilot on the base in there. Gimme a cigarette.
- You want a light too?
- I have only the habit, Lieutenant.
[Door Opening]
Well, they're still at it, sir.
You know, Harvey, you're gonna make a silly-looking second lieutenant.
Want some advice from your lawyer, sir?
Don't ever give up the case before the jury comes in.
Don't kid yourself.
We've already had it.
Well, so what? What's so bad about the Pentagon building?
- Good food, cocktails every night.
- [Door Opening]
Well, sir, that was short and sweet.
Yeah,
I'll bet it was.
Well, you might as well unpack, General.
The I.G. Didn't even get to make a good opening speech.
Bishop started it, withdrawing his transfer.
Wilson followed, and the rest of them just climbed aboard.
Left the I.G. With nothing to do but pack up his hatchet and go home.
[Chuckles]
Well, what do you know?
Where's that briefcase of mine?
I had it a minute ago.
I knew those jokers couldn't buck you forever.
They finally realized they had a chance to hit the target... and get home when you were up front leading.
Well, they better not count on any one man.
Don't want to make that mistake again.
You know, General, it wouldn't be any mistake... to cut loose with a few three-day passes to London.
Sort of, uh... a pat on the back.
I see what you mean.
Kiss and make up, huh?
You kiss them, Joe, for shedding their diapers.
And while you're at it, tell 'em we're going to work now... and try to build some leadership around here.
And when it comes to counting on me, tell 'em that you're gonna lead the next one.
And it better be good.
And tell Bishop he's gonna lead... and find out what it feels like to carry the load.
I want this group combed for every man who shows signs... of being able to lead a mule to water.
And I want every one of'em to have a crack at it.
You're out from under those second lieutenant bars, Harvey, so don't just stand around with your thumb in your mouth.
Let's get back to work.
What did he have to burn three feet off my tail surface for?
- Tough man, isn't he?
- There's such a thing... as carrying this business of being iron-tailed too far.
Yeah, he's-he's pretty iron-tailed.
He'll never feel things about the group the way Keith Davenport did.
And nothing's going to start eating holes through him.
- He's too tough for that.
- There's also such
You know something, Joe? The only difference between Frank Savage... and Keith Davenport is that...
Savage is about, uh, that much taller.
I don't get it.
- [Chattering]
- Hey, Joe, how come
You been a bad boy?
You know Joe, he only leads the milk runs. This one must be a doozy.
Come on, Joe, where we goin'?
Pull back that curtain. Give us a peek.
You'll wish I was leadin' it.
You're gonna love this one.
Attention!
Rest!
Gentlemen, this you'll be interested to know.
Intelligence informs us... that the German aircraft industry has been converted... almost entirely to the production of fighter planes for defense, and that these fiighters are being withdrawn from the Russian front... to beef up the defense on this front.
Looks like they must have heard about the 918th.
And this morning we have a mission of some importance.
- For the first time...
- Germany!
You said it.
- Wilhelmshaven.
- [Men Repeating] Wilhelmshaven.
For the first time we're going to be hitting a target on German soil.
I'll lead the group on this one.
Bishop, the High Squadron.
Holloman, the Low Squadron.
- All right, Joe.
- Stations: 0700.
Start engines: 0710.
Taxi: 0720.
[Teletype Clattering]
Got a cigarette?
They're heading in, Major.
We just got a reading.
- How many?
- I don't know, sir.
Here they come.
They're approaching the field.
[Engines Droning
Overhead]
Nine.
- Fourteen.
- Fifteen. Sixteen.
- How was it, sir?
- It was rough.
- They were waiting for us.
What's the count?
It looked like four, but O'Neill made it to the RAF field at Lincolnshire.
Gately ditched in the Channel.
Air-Sea Rescue picked 'em up.
- Two wounded but not bad.
- Well, that helps some.
- Let's get up to interrogation.
- Yes, sir.
McIllhenny!
Yes, sir!
- Were you in my ship?
- No, sir.
That is...
Yes, sir.
- Who authorized it?
- No one, sir, but I been and I just had to make the big ones.
I won't have ground personnel jeopardizing the safety of the aircraft.
Maybe it'll help you keep your feet on the ground... if you take those stripes off again.
And this time you'll stay a private.
- Get up to interrogation.
- Yes, sir.
I want a critique of the mission first thing in the morning, Joe.
Looks like we might stand down a few days with the weather.
Maybe we're ready to give 'em a breather.
- Peel out some passes for London.
- Yes, sir.
General, I got to talk to you about Sergeant McIllhenny.
- What about him?
- You're busting him. That kind
- What's complicated about that?
- It's the precedent, sir.
I mean, we'd have to bust
Captain Twombley too.
The Padre?
What's he got to do with it?
He stowed away, too, with Bishop.
They were over Wilhelmshaven before Bishop found out.
He heard the parson praying on the interphone... while he was firing the left waist gun.
[Sighs]
Well, now I've heard everything.
I'm afraid you haven't, sir.
I, uh, might as well give it to you in one slug.
No thank you, sir.
Harvey Stovall and Doc Kaiser flew as waist gunners with Klein.
I guess the whole ground echelon was someplace on this one.
- Any of'em hurt?
- Don't think so, sir.
There's one more thing about McIllhenny... kind of awkward.
He's just been credited with two F.W. S destroyed and one probable.
A born gunner,
I guess.
- Did you know about this, Joe?
- No, sir, I didn't.
- I hope you don't think I...
- All right. All right.
[Savage]
Twombley! Stovall!
Come over here.
Well, you're pretty proud of yourselves, I suppose.
- Well, let me tell you...
- I was hoping the general
I think I'm suffering from combat fatigue.
Harvey, I'm gonna weaken just this once, and I'll probably live to regret it.
But you got the bulge on me.
I can't bust everybody.
But it's with the clear understanding that your combat days are over.
An old fud like you ought to know better.
I won't be put in the spot of having to write that letter to your wife.
You, Padre.
Your business is sin.
Hereafter, you'll confine your activities to that
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Did you hit anything up there, Harvey?
Well, sir, my glasses were frosted over some, but I think
I got a piece of one.
Ours or theirs?
McIllhenny, I heard about those two F.W.s.
- Put the chevrons back on, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
And if we're gonna keep having these ups and downs,
- I suggest you get 'em with zippers.
- Yes, sir!
- [Man] When are they due back?
- [Man #2] Any time now.
[Engines Droning
Overhead]
Call the tower.
Get a count.
- Tower.
- Tower.
- What's the count?
- Twenty back. One missing... 3-9-7.
We lost one...
Lieutenant Bishop, sir.
All right.
Thanks, Sergeant.
Junker 88s, and FW-190.
- Uh, what direction were they comin'in?
See any chutes open?
No. Jesse caught a direct burst right over the target.
They...
They didn't have a chance.
He was a swell kid, and one of the best pilots in the group.
- He would have to get it.
- One crew...
It could've been much worse, Joe.
- What about battle damage?
- Everybody caught plenty.
- More coffee, General?
- General...
No, thank you. I tired to reach you on the phone to tell you about Gately.
Well, what about him?
Did he get hit today?
No, sir. But right after he landed, he folded up... passed out cold.
I guess I should have made an examination before, but he didn't report any injury when he ditched
I've seen his X-rays. He has a crack in the lip of the vertebrate body.
- Painful?
- Incredibly.
And he's flown three missions with it.
- A fractured spine?
- That's about what it amounts to.
I've put him in traction.
Gately...
Okay, Doc.
Thanks for letting me know.
- Now, I'll have that coffee.
- Fine.
Anybody in particular you'd like to see, sir?
Oh, no thanks, Lieutenant, just looking around.
You go right on with what you were doing.
Yes, sir.
Well, looks like that's gonna cut in on your crap shooting, Dwight.
Yes, sir.
It's costing me money.
- How long they gonna keep you in here?
- Doc said ten days.
- Well, you let me know if I can do anything.
What do you say, Birdwell?
- They got all that flak out of you yet?
Doc didn't need no mine detector to find it, neither.
You getting enough chow?
Oh, just livin' in the tall cotton, sir.
- Well, how you feeling, Ben?
- I'm okay, General.
I was sorry to hear about your bad luck.
Thank you, sir.
Well, I see Doc didn't waste much time...
Oh, excuse me, Ben.
That's pretty sensitive, huh?
That's okay, General.
Go ahead and sit down.
Oh, I'd rather stand.
[Chuckles]
I've been piling up more sitting time than flying time, anyway.
Hey, what kind of a gadget is this... part of the Wright Brothers' first airplane?
Looks uncomfortable enough.
Uh, help the back any?
Relieves the pressure quite a bit, sir.
How long, uh, Doc say you're gonna be laid up?
A few weeks, sir.
- Is it pretty painful?
- Not much, sir.
All right. I guess you don't feel much like talking...
That's okay, General.
Go right ahead.
Um...
Ben...
Yes, sir?
I-I was just gonna say, uh...
Anything you want?
Something I can send you?
Not a thing, General.
I've got everything I need.
You just let us know if you do need anything.
Thank you, sir.
I, uh... I'm gonna drop in across the hall.
I'll be seeing you, Ben.
Looks like I'll have to rate you a "class-A" customer, Colonel.
I just learned you're something extra special.
Gentlemen, this mission has been handed us by the Combined Chiefs of Staff.
It is a target of critical importance, which will require a deeper penetration than any we have made... far beyond possible fighter support.
If we can attack and destroy it, we will have proved daylight precision bombing.
This is the one we have been waiting for.
With the limited equipment we have, it will probably take three trips to carry enough bombs... to the target to destroy it.
I needn't tell you you'll have to help plan these strikes... down to the last pint of gas, the last pound of load, the last second of time.
All right,
Colonel Davenport.
There it is, what we're after... ball bearings.
We've found that almost the entire
German production of ball bearings... is concentrated here.
Without ball bearings, the entire German armament industry... will slow to a halt.
Wish I had something stronger for you, Frank, but I haven't.
If we bring this one off, things are likely to pick up fast.
I think we may get three or four whole new groups thrown at us.
Growing up, huh?
How soon can you turn loose down there and come back up here and help me?
- Well, that's, uh, kind of hard to say, sir.
On paper, the group looks fine now.
The leadership's the problem, always has been.
Haven't you got the personnel?
Want me to transfer you somebody?
There's nothing wrong with our personnel.
I-I lost
Bishop and Holloman.
Cobb's okay, so is Gately, but he's just out of the hospital.
Takes time to know.
- How long before you figure you will know?
How can you be sure? How do you know what you're pushing Gately into?
How do you know we didn't send Bishop just that once too often?
- I'm the one that's down there and...
- Frank!
You're swinging after the bell.
Tell me something, will you?
What was the name of the man you relieved?
Who, Keith?
What was his trouble?
Do you remember?
You're not propping them up too, are you?
Take a good look,
Frank.
Do you think that?
It would be natural enough, the things you go through with a bunch of those boys, working your way out of the hole with them.
It's hard not to let them get under your hide.
And the one thing
I've noticed on the record lately... you've been flying more missions rather than less.
Look, General, I'm the one that's got to shove them up there.
And until I know they're ready,
I'm not about to turn 'em loose.
All right, Frank. Make it as soon as you can, will you?
- You bet I will, sir.
- You tell me when?
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, Frank.
Bring me back a ball bearing.
And as a personal favor, try to keep yourself in one piece, will you?
Well, that seems like a reasonable request.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- Keith.
- Yes, sir.
I want the files on the air execs and the operations officers... in all the groups with recommendations on those... who might be qualified to take over a group in an emergency.
- Anything special?
- No. Nothing special...
- just checking, but keep it to yourself.
Thanks.
- Tail wheel.
- Locked. Light off, sir.
Brakes.
Over Splasher
Beacon nine, navigator.
- Set course for combat wing assembly line.
Tail-gunner, let me know...
- when the other groups tack on to me.
- Roger.
Uh, Savage to crew.
10,000 feet.
Go on oxygen.
From now on, we're registering on the enemy radar screen.
The Luftwaffe's already warming up for us so watch your chatter.
Let's not tell 'em any more than we have to.
Navigator to Commander.
Departing English coast on course, on time, sir.
Savage to gunners.
Okay to test your guns.
- Uh-huh.
- [Teletype Clattering]
Yeah. Again.
- Pick them up yet?
- He's got the Air Ministry
Yeah, say it again.
All right. Thanks very much.
I'll ring you again.
"Your aircraft are approaching the enemy coast at 24,000 feet.
"D-D-I-4-B, our intercept station, reports...
"the largest enemy fighter reaction we've recorded.
"The enemy control is ordering down units from as far north as Denmark... and as far south as Jafue Five."
Mm, here's the new wrinkle.
"The Hun ground controllers are instructing their pilots... to ram your aircraft if necessary."
Navigator, do you estimate we've crossed the enemy coast?
- Yes, sir. We sure have.
- [Flak Bursting]
Change course...
15 degrees left.
Heads up, everybody.
The flak's quit.
Look out for fighters.
Four F. W. S,
10 o'clock level, climbing.
Clock 'em.
Coming up on the other side.
Don't yell on the interphone.
Be specific.
- How many? Where?
- Eleven F. W. S, three o'clock.
[Savage] On your toes,
High Squadron. Low Squadron,
Watch it, Cobb.
They're heading for the High Squadron.
[Machine Guns Firing]
Birdwell got a direct hit, sir.
He's going down.
Two squadrons of M.E. S climbing at 12 o'clock, General.
I see 'em. There's six more, nine o'clock level, about a mile.
Gately, move that Low Squadron forward still more.
Able to Baker and Charlie Force Leaders.
They may fake a side attack to cover the real attack out of the sun.
Watch out for mass attacks, eight to ten abreast.
More comin'around from one.
Watch 'em, Eddie. Watch 'em!
I got one!
He's bailing out.
Confiirm that, right-waist.
B-17 droppin'out of Low Squadron in trouble.
Keep an eye on him, left-waist.
Two men bailing out.
Three more.
They're on fiire.
Save your ammunition.
We got a long way to go.
Shorten bursts.
Don't waste rounds.
B-17 out of control, three o'clock.
There goes another Charlie.
He's spinning in, sir.
Navigator, did we make up that two and half minutes yet?
Yes, sir, we...
Watch that F.W., Vince!
...doesn't shift any more, we'll be okay at control point seven.
Here come three more.
Close it up tight.
[Explosion Rumbles]
- Savage to crew.
How bad are we hit?
We're hit bad, sir, in radio compartment. On fire.
Well, get in there and see what you can do about it.
Rest of crew, hold your stations.
Let's settle down.
Bombardier to Commander.
Flak at 12 o'clock level.
Well, we can forget about fighters for a while.
Able to Baker and Charlie Force.
Change of plans. Start your bomb run from Halstuben. Acknowledge.
Charlie Leader. Wilco.
Baker Leader to Able Leader.
We'll be bombing in a bad crosswind.
Secondary target looks clear.
Able to Baker. No dice.
We'll hit the primary.
Repeat. Your new I.P.
Is Halstuben.
Roger.
- Halstuben dead ahead, sir.
- Pilot to bombardier. Center the P.D.I.
- P.D.I. Centered, sir.
- Pilot to bombardier.
You're flying the airplane now.
It's all yours.
- [Whirring]
- Bomb bay doors open.
[Bombs Whistling]
We clobbered 'em good.
Right on the button!
Tail-gunner, how's that formation back there?
Baker Force reassembling okay.
Charlie Force is strung out bad.
F.W. S attacking the stragglers.
Able and Charlie, we'll give you a slow turn to the left.
Cut across and get back in formation.
Cobb to Commander. We'll be turning over a heavy flak belt, sir.
Can't help it, Joe. Better than leaving those stragglers to the fighters.
- That is roger.
- [Explosion]
Direct burst, sir!
Bail out, Joe!
Bail out!
Jump, you guys!
Jump!
[Sighs]
Well, Keith, welcome to Operation Stovall.
Glad to see you, Frank.
How does it look for tomorrow?
Can't tell yet.
Lots of damage.
- I'm sorry aboutJoe.
- Well, that's the way it goes.
- Any more on the weather, Ben?
- Looks okay, sir.
Good. Looks like all we got left to do is go get it done.
The old man was mighty pleased with the results, Frank.
Well, he ought to be.
From the strike photos, it looks as though tomorrow might wash it up if we're any good.
Did you know he went on the mission today?
- No!
- He slipped into Curt May's plane.
I don't think Curt knew till he crossed the enemy coast.
[Laughs]
So the old man's stowing away these days, huh?
I wish I'd have known it.
I'd a crowded 'em...
- a little closer to that flak at Frankfurt.
- How'd the other boys make out?
- A little rough.
But they'll put up the maximum for tomorrow or close to it.
- Good.
- "The maximum."
Maximum effort.
Are you drunk,
Colonel Stovall?
I am a little. I... believe I warned the general that it might happen again sometime.
Well, what do you know.
Keep it going till tomorrow night, and I'll join you.
I believe
I shall, sir.
Sometime I think Harvey drew the worst end of the racket.
Just sit here.
Watch 'em come and go.
Fill out all those stinkin' papers.
[Stovall] That is not why
I am drunk tonight.
I got drunk because I am confused.
I was thinking, which is a thing a man should not do, and all at once
I couldn't remember... what any of them looked like.
I... I couldn't see their faces.
Bishop, Cobb.
Wilson, Zimmy... all of them.
All of you.
They all looked alike. Just... one face and...
It was very young, and it confused me.
I think
I shall stay drunk... until I'm not confused anymore.
Stay with it,
Harvey.
But if you guys want to carouse some more, you're going to have
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Ben.
Good night, Keith.
Boy, am I gonna sleep tonight.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Colonel.
Guess it's about that time.
Good luck, Frank.
[Gately]
Good luck, Frank.
Good luck, sir.
What's the matter, sir?
I don't know.
- Are you sick, sir?
- Arm... something's wrong.
- It won't work.
- You want me to take it?
No. Tell, uh...
Tell...
Tell Gately to take it.
Yes, sir.
He'll take it.
Get hold of Doc Kaiser.
I'll take the lead ship.
- Where's my oxygen mask?
- Fra... Frank!
Frank.
Come on, Frank!
Come on.
Get in theJeep.
Frank!
Frank, are you sick?
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Where's Keith?
- I'm right here, Frank!
[Savage]
Call the tower! Where's...
Where's Keith?
[Savage]
Can't make it!
We can't go!
We can't send 'em out there again!
Stop them!
Stop them!
Stop them.
We can't make it! Stop them!
Cigarette, Frank?
How about a smoke?
- What do you make of it?
- State of shock.
Complete collapse.
Everything let go at once.
Can't you give him a hypo, Doc?
Something to knock him out,
No. In his present condition it wouldn't be any good.
He's somewhere up there with the mission.
When they get back maybe he'll let go.
I hope.
It's screwy. I wouldn't ever have figured it could happen to him.
I did. I watched him sweep his feelings under the carpet long enough.
It had to spill out someday.
But I never saw him more full of fight than he was at briefing.
Did you ever see a light bulb burn out, how bright the filament is just before it lets go?
I think they call it
"maximum effort."
[Ticking]
[Phone Rings]
Colonel Davenport.
That's fine.
Thanks very much.
The strike report,
Frank.
They hit the primary okay.
Gately reports results good.
They clobbered it,
Frank!
Frank, try and listen to me.
I know what you're feeling.
I know just what you're feeling.
You think you blew it.
What do you expect of yourself, Frank?
Look.
Look, I saw something in those kid's faces at briefing this morning.
Something
I never put there.
You were gonna make 'em grow up, remember?
Well, they were this morning.
You think you aren't up there with them?
Look, you're riding at every crew station and in every cockpit.
That's right, don't listen to me.
Just sit there and do it the hard way.
Tell yourself a hundred times a day that you blew it.
Make yourself believe it.
Take it to bed with you!
Eat your guts out till you're all hollow inside!
[Bomber Engines

They're back,
Frank.
Six. Seven.
[Engines Roaring

Eight. Nine.

Twelve. Thirteen.
- Fourteen.
- [Bombers Zooming Overheard]

- Tower.
- You got a count, Captain?
Twenty-one dispatched.
Nineteen returned, sir.
The boys really did it today.
Nineteen.
They made it.
Nineteen of them.
- Who led?
- Ben Gately.
Is-Is he back all right?
Yes, Frank, he's back.
I'm kind of tired.
I think I'll... go to sleep for a little while.
- [Men] Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me
Anyone else but me
No, no, no don't sit under the apple tree
With anyone else but me
Till I come marching home
With anyone else but me
Till I come marching home
We're poor little lambs who have lost our way
Baa, baa, baa
- We're little black sheep who have gone astray
Running Water?
Tell Mr. Davis I am here.
Davis gone.
Gone where? I was supposed to fly him down to Fort Churchill.
Davis go with good pilot.
- What do you mean, "Go with good pilot"?
- MacLean good pilot.
What am I supposed to be?
MacLean good pilot.
Yeah, well, MacLean has sure enough sold you a bill of goods.
Well, that's the best job I never got.
Mr. Turner. Here I am. I wait for you for a half-hour.
Where you were?
Blimp is always on time, eh?
I thought maybe that robber, Brian
MacLean, was here first and took you off.
Come on, we go. I take you to Moon Lake.
- We're not going until tomorrow night.
- No, tomorrow I'm busy.
I have to fly a Mountie to Lac La Loche.
I'll just have time to take you to Moon Lake.
- Plane's ready.
- Never mind.
We're going tomorrow with MacLean.
He's gonna haul us for $25 less.
- MacLean?
- MacLean.
MacLean should pay you to fly him.
Meanwhile, his price is $25 under yours. We just closed the deal.
I do not wish to meet the price of a burglar. I have honor.
You can have it. We got the $25. Come on, Charlie.
Wait a minute.
Maybe we can talk of some better terms.
- We'll sleep on it.
- I hope you don't wake up.
MacLean. MacLean here, MacLean there.
Every place is MacLean.
Take it easy. We're practically there.
Got it?
Well, Bert, I got those dogs for you. Real bargain.
- What's the matter?
- I don't see how I can use...
...two dog teams, or pay for them, as far as that goes.
- What do you mean two dog teams?
- I bought a dog team.
There they are over there. See them?
- Where'd they come from?
- Fellow flew them from Bear Island.
There he goes.
Is his name MacLean? Brian MacLean?
Yeah, that's right.
You wanted a team. I flew to
North Island to get them for you.
Well, I told him too,
Johnny, and he got here first.
And besides, he hauls the dogs cheaper than you. A whole lot cheaper.
He won't be hauling cheaper after I catch up with him.
All right, Joey. Cast off.
No one man can be in as many places as he is.
This MacLean must be quintuplets.
I wish that was so. It'd be more fun to kill him five times.
I'd settle for once.
Mr. MacLean sounds like a very nice man. I like to meet him too.
You do, I give him 10 minutes to fly away with your restaurant.
My very best passenger and he steals him.
That double-crossing, double-dealing bush pilot...
...stole my best passenger from under my nose.
- Hello.
- Hello, Scrounger.
- Hello, Popcorn.
- Hi.
- Sounds like MacLean.
- It is and isn't cricket. Coffee, if I may.
I heard about him from
Mamie Watson at Trout Lake.
- She's nuts about him.
- What's that?
Snatching business is bad enough, but dames is serious.
He's all over the place, yet we can't catch up with him.
If I knew what plane to look for, I would.
It's a single engine job with black fuselage and orange wings.
Son of a moose. Black fuselage and orange wings.
- I saw that this morning.
- Where?
Heading north to Lac vert. I waved to him.
- oh, I could cut my throat.
- Well, I'll cut his instead.
He's heading north, who's heading north with me?
- I am.
- No, wait a minute. I do it myself.
No, you won't. I got a piece of him all marked out.
If it's the same piece I have marked, he's gonna look very funny.
Darn it. I would have a job waiting.
Well, if one of you fellows will finance me with petrol, I'll lead you.
Kick the chappy in the teeth.
- Don't worry. We will.
- He has three kicks coming.
Is my credit good for a hamburger?
- No.
- Thanks.
Sam. Look, Johnny's got a new plane.
Get your gear ready. oh, it's a beauty. I bet it could go anywhere.
Doggone it. He would come just when I'd holed in for the day.
Hello, Johnny. Johnny!
The name is not Johnny. Never was Johnny.
Tie her off on the bow, sweet.
- I thought you were somebody else.
- I always seem like somebody else.
Here. Snub it off against that cleat, will you?
The name is Brian.
I said, the name is Brian. Say it.
Brian.
- Again?
- Brian.
You give it something it never had before. Give me a hand, will you?
- one.
- Hey.
Two.
Three.
I can see where I gotta make this stop more often.
Now, let's see if you're as practical as you are beautiful. one.
- Hey.
- oh, well, all right.
Come on.
There you are.
Got some money for me, Ed?
Yes.
- Foster?
- Yes?
- Stuff from Hanson's.
- Hanson's?
Johnny Dutton used to bring the stuff.
- Johnny Dutton used to.
- Here, sign right there.
Say, don't you think I ought to know my assistant?
Well, this is my daughter, Emily.
- Emily, this is, Mr...
- Brian MacLean.
I'm very pleased to meet you, I think.
The pleasure's all yours.
After meeting you, I know she got that from her mother.
I think I like it.
Take it easy, Sam. Johnny will be here in a few minutes.
I'll wait. I'm way behind in my loafing anyway.
Do so many men pass through here that you can afford to ice me? or maybe you're saving yourself up for old fuzzy-face down on the pier. Is that it?
That's better.
He looks as though he'd been waiting a long time for something.
He's waiting for my fiancé.
Fiancé?
Well, competition. I like that. It makes me look better.
Who's the unlucky guy?
Johnny Dutton.
Johnny Dutton, the flier?
And he's a very jealous man.
And you say that old fuzzy-face is waiting for him?
Well, darling, I'll see you a little later. I just found a job.
Where could you find a job standing there?
In the depths of your pretty brown eyes, sweet.
My name is MacLean, Brian MacLean.
I'm Sam Morrison. They call me Store-Teeth.
I've heard of you. You certainly have a lot of patience.
I'd be sore if somebody hung me up.
It's a darn long paddle up to the Rupert.
I don't mind waiting a couple days.
I guess it isn't Johnny's fault at that.
That engine of his has been acting very badly lately.
- It has?
- Yeah, yeah.
About ready to drop out of the crate.
Don't you get scared going with Johnny?
No. Always feel mighty safe flying with Johnny.
In fact, I don't feel safe with anyone else.
I guess it's all right as long as you're wearing a chute.
- Chute?
- Yeah. Parachute.
Doesn't Johnny supply them?
- Well, he's...
- oh, look. A man's silly not to wear one.
It's unfair to a passenger not to give him one.
In case anything happens, jump out, pull this cord, a big umbrella thing opens up...
...and you float to earth like you were lying on a cloud.
What will they think of next?
In Johnny's plane, all you can do is sit there and wait and then:
- I never thought of that.
- Come on.
I'll take you to the Rupert for $45.
Nope. Johnny only charges me 42.
You're not as safe with
Johnny as you are with me.
I don't know. He always seemed safe when I was flying with him.
Well, I guess he has been pretty lucky at that.
Except last year when he sideslipped into
Hudson Bay and killed four passengers.
- He did?
- Yeah, Johnny felt very badly about that. very badly. But you gotta give him credit.
Keeping on flying that old hatbox after all that's happened.
If you're that kind of daredevil, good luck. I'll be on my way.
Hey, wait a minute.
Help me with this duffle.
Let's get going before Johnny gets here.
I'll throw your stuff in the freight department.
We'll pick up our business in a couple of days.
Move on. Get in there. Get in the front.
Your engine sounds noisier than Johnny's.
That's because it's faster.
When do you plan on leaving your diggings?
- Around about the first of next June.
- First of June? I'll be up to get you.
Hey. Hang on to that steering stick, will you?
I'll bring you back to Lac vert for $50.
Grab that stick, will you?
Come to think of it, I'd be losing money. Fifty-five dollars.
All right, all right, $55.
Just hold on to that stick.
All right, MacLean, you are finished now.
Set her down.
- Friends of yours?
- I don't think so.
What happens next?
Not what they think.
Here we go, Dad.
Hold on to your plates. okay, Johnny. I get him.
- You gonna stay there, Dad?
- Yep.
Well, take a good hold.
He's coming right at us.
Don't try to fly through the woods. Fly over them.
Stop the ship.
Stop the ship. I wanna get off.
I've had enough.
Come on down, you coward, where I can get my hands on you.
- Fellas like him have got no right to fly.
-  He seems all right.
I wanna get out of here.
I gotta get out of here.
Gee, I wish I was an eagle.
Get this door open. I could just get this door open.
Hey, what are you...?
Come on, come back here.
- Let go of me.
- Come in here and sit down.
Fun's all over.
Hey. What brought you back?
A whim.
Well, you can keep on going. oh, you don't know me. I have a whim of iron. Here, catch.
Hitch it up yourself.
If Blimp had only cut across instead of circling.
- He's probably still going around.
- He'll catch on in a couple days.
But doggone it, I hate to lose that propeller. I paid off on it.
Yeah. We have more than enough time to get to Winnipeg...
...and buy another one before dark.
We'll stop by Lac vert for lunch.
I knew that was coming.
I wish I had a girl in Lac vert.
Hey, look.
His nibs' plane.
He won't get away this time.
Johnny, if you catch up with that chiseler, and I think you will...
...remember to save me a piece of his gall.
You know, you could do this yourself. You didn't hurt your hands.
But I did. Look.
- Hey, you're a sick man.
- I feel awful.
Let go of me. I've got other things to do.
Hello.
From your expression, you're Johnny Dutton.
That's right. You're MacLean?
Pull up a chair and have a double mickey.
- Who caught up with you?
- Nobody.
I fell on my head and hurt myself so
I could get your fiancée to nurse me.
- Slight fracture?
- Not my head.
- Anything else on your mind?
- Yeah.
- You been stealing jobs and cutting rates.
-  So?
Soon as that head heals, I'm gonna kick it.
Well, you can start trying right now.
Brian. Now, you promised to stay quiet.
What are you trying to do, kill yourself?
- What'd he do to you?
- What'd he do?
- Walked in and pulled a knife on me.
- He's a liar.
- Knife was that long.
- The guy's nuts.
Don't mind him. He talks crazy half the time.
- Aren't you going to say hello to me?
- Hi, Johnny.
Here, let me help you.
Easy with your head.
You're all wet, pal, or do you know it?
Up with your head. Easy.
You wouldn't be having a good time if you could stand.
I can still make things warm enough to dry you off.
Brian!
Hey.
I thought you was gonna save me a piece of that.
I didn't touch him. So ornery, he brained himself.
Come on, help me get him on the couch.
If he's at death's door,
I'd pull him through.
- How'd he hurt himself?
- Prop nicked him.
- Prop?
- Prop?
This guy needs a doctor.
A doctor? The nearest one's at Churchtown.
It looks like you and me are gonna do some digging.
Why couldn't we just take him on the lake? oh, shut up.
- What's that doctor's name in Churchtown?
- Dr. Neville.
For my dough, that's a long way to go for that son of a bozo.
All he did is nick his gourd.
Goodbye, darling.
Come on, Tiny, help me gas my plane.
- Hurry, Johnny.
- You're always gassing the plane.
- He'll be dead and you won't be back...
- I'll be back by midnight.
- Can you land in the dark?
- It'll be bright tonight. There's a full moon.
- Moon or no moon, 3-to-1 you crack up. - It's a bet.
- How much?
- A buck.
- Make it 2 bucks.
- Right.
Two bucks. Let's go.
- Well, how is he?
- I can't tell. He seems the same.
He's better off than Johnny if he tries to land under this.
- He'll turn back.
- You don't know Johnny.
Besides, if he runs out of gas, he will be in a mess.
We're gonna need all hands. You, your father, myself and Indians.
- Dad can get the Indians.
- Let's get started.
I've gotta build a raft, we need some gas, so roust your old man out.
We may as well do it now.
A murky, filthy mess. It looks like it'll choke you.
We got enough gas to get back to Churchtown.
Another five minutes, we won't have any choice. We'll have to go on.
My boy, I'm 64 years old.
If I survive this...
...it'll be to fall prey to angina, sclerosis or one of the other ills of age.
- Wanna go on?
- By all means.
A quick operation's the only way to save your friend. okay. Get this straight.
He's no friend of mine.
Brace yourself. Here we go.
No.
No! No! No!
I sure lost that bet.
He take it out now.
- Take what out?
- Piece of bone, right out of his head.
Let me see.
No take them.
Four good ships in the air...
...two in reserve, then you got a real airline.
- I told those bankers in Winnipeg...
- Don't you think the doctor better stay?
If something happened, I wouldn't know what to do.
You'll be all right. Doctor's gotta get back. He's got a couple of pneumonia cases.
I'd feel better if he was.
Don't worry. A few days of your cooking and he'll be as good as new.
I kind of wish I had a hole in my head.
Those bankers told me if I had a good winter, we could start that airline in spring.
- That'll be fine.
- I'll say it will.
Scheduled flights, mechanics to take care of the work, an agent to line up business.
- Johnny, do you love me?
- of course I do.
Why do you say, "of course"?
Why don't you just say, "I love you, Emily"?
Now, what got into you? You know I love you. Didn't we plan this airline just for us?
- Will you take me to Winnipeg?
- I will someday.
- Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, Winnipeg...
- And New York?
New York. once this airline gets going, we're gonna have vacations every year. vacations in style.
You know where I think the home port will be? Waterways on the Christina.
- That's the end of the rail...
- Let's not wait for the airline.
Take me with you now. We can be married in Churchtown.
I'd like to, Emily, but I won't.
Mrs. Dutton isn't gonna start housekeeping in the cabin of a bush pilot's plane.
She's gonna have a real home, electric lights, plumbing, soft furniture...
...and right near the home port.
At waterways on the Christina?
At waterways on the Christina.
- Say, young lady, you're cold.
- Am I?
Well, maybe just a little bit.
- Well, the patient's fine.
- Good.
- Have some coffee, doc?
- I think I will. It's been a long night.
Emily, keep the young man off his feet, he'll be all right in a couple weeks.
- Tiny can stay here and help you.
- oh, he'll just get in the way.
That's right. The doctor's got a good idea.
You slab-sided hunk of hawk meat.
Putting Johnny to trouble and dishing me out of a bet.
And me getting sick because you had a bone taken out of your head. I...
"Port Wilson Mining Co., see about September 1 st. "
Port Wilson Mining Company.
Well, well, well, well.
Johnny, take good care of the doc.
You can never tell when we might need him. okay, I'll be back in no time.
Yeah, but not without no prop.
The plane's no good without it.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Johnny.
Help Emily take care of his nibs.
Johnny, stop at Port Wilson and see the mine superintendent.
- What for?
- Well, I kind of got a hunch...
...he might have work for a couple of guys like us.
- okay. So long, Tiny.
- So long, Johnny.
Goodbye, darling.
- Don't forget to stop at Port Wilson.
- Right.
Take her away.
Sure glad you're staying.
A lot of things to do.
- oh, you mean work, huh?
- With a sick man, there'll be more dishes.
Yes, and pumps to be primed, butter to be churned, stock to be fed.
Anything else I do, I suppose I could do Sundays, couldn't I? Couldn't I?
- You're awake.
- Yeah, I think so.
Tell me something, Emily.
How does a fella keep from going absolutely and incurably nuts around here?
I thought you liked it here.
Two more weeks and I'll be shaking hands with myself.
It's not a nice thing to say.
You're not gonna tell me you wouldn't leave if you had a chance.
I'll be leaving soon.
I'm going to the cities.
I'm gonna do everything everybody else does.
Mr. Dutton will not like that.
Mr. Dutton will be my husband and he'll take me. oh, it's a shame. A very great shame.
You'd be a riot in Montreal and
Chicago and New York. You know that?
Do you think so?
I know it. You'd knock those dudes' eyes out.
They'd be lined up outside your door.
I'd be there with a baseball bat, beating them off.
If you weren't busy with one of your ladies.
Yeah, that could be.
When I go to the cities
I'll be on my honeymoon.
Didn't I tell you "honeymoon under the bright lights" was a come-on?
When did he hand you that?
- When he kissed me good night.
- oh, that proves it. That proves it.
Nobody but a chump would talk to a girl when kissing her.
Nobody but a bush leaguer would have to.
- I suppose you wouldn't?
- There's no fun in just supposing.
You wanna talk?
You see, either a fellow has it or he hasn't.
- There you are.
- Thanks.
- Here are your cigarettes.
- Here you are.
There's the bill for the prop.
There's the bill for the strut.
There's the bill for the stabilizer you owe us. oh, put them away, chump. Put them away.
You'd have done exactly the same to me if you'd known how.
Hold it, Tiny. What do you got lined up for the winter, MacLean? oh, I've been doing some promoting.
Something always turns up.
I'll let you find the job, I'll keep taking them away from you.
I got one you don't have to take away from us. I'll cut you in.
- Big-hearted divvy. What is this,
Christmas? - Nope. Plain business.
I've got a job lined up for all winter. Take three planes to swing it.
Line up of six mines, we fly the dynamite and supplies in and the concentrates out.
Dynamite and concentrate. You'll do anything to get that airline.
- That's right.
- That is right.
All winter? And you say there's a string of six mines?
Yeah. How about it?
Where did you say this job was?
- Port Wilson.
- Port Wilson?
Yeah, I stopped by there and talked to the superintendent.
Is the superintendent's name Nolan?
Yes. You know him?
Know him? I know the whole setup.
- You do?
- Well, you gonna go in with us?
Go in with you? Not on your life. I'll swipe my jobs honestly.
- What do you mean by that crack?
- If you don't know, he does.
Yeah... Who? Me?
Now, let's get this straight.
I offered you this job because you're a good flier and you owe us money.
I'd rather have any other flier than a price-cutting, job-stealing...
- Job-stealing? Job-stealing? -
Wait. Wait a minute. Spread out.
Break it up.
Come on, Brian. I wanna talk to you for a minute.
I wanna talk to you for more than a minute.
I didn't say anything about swiping your notebook.
With the exception of Port Wilson, half the other jobs were his.
- He lined them up himself.
- We're all agreed. Johnny's a tin saint.
- Anything else bothering you?
- Yeah.
You're muscling in on Emily.
- Well, wouldn't you if you had a chance?
- No.
- You know Johnny's gonna marry Emily.
- Marry him, huh?
- I wonder what for.
- Well, usual reason, I suppose.
Makes him more of a dope than I thought.
Some friend ought to tell him she's the kind to run him ragged.
That I don't know, but you're chiseling on a guy who saved your life.
Saved my life. He brought me a doctor.
- Would any flier do that for another?
- Sure.
Plenty of fog, no moon, looks like no dice...
...and suddenly he winds up in the lake here with a doctor for you.
That is the story of how the intrepid flier brought the doctor to the dying patient.
How do you think the doctor got here, on a streetcar?
No.
You fellas make enough money to save some of it.
I'm with you on that Port Wilson job.
Well, that... That's fine.
I wanna be there for the bang when you land. I'll pick my stuff.
Sure you're strong enough?
- Get the supplies out of the store.
- I'll straighten up the room.
That new partner of yours can certainly make a mess of things.
- Help me check MacLean's plane.
- What?
You shouldn't take off your bandage.
- I don't need it anymore. Head's all cured.
- Look, you don't have to go.
Brian, you haven't got any reason to go.
You could stay here.
There are jobs to be found. or we could go to ottawa or New York.
You ought to take your friends into confidence.
What do you mean?
You didn't tell me what Johnny went through to get that doctor.
I'll marry Johnny. What's that got to do with you and me?
Just about everything.
So long, sweet.
Brian.
Brian.
- Can you see him?
- What?
No sight of him yet?
What?
The wind is coming from all directions.
What were you yelling at me?
- Can you see him?
- You can't see 10 feet in that rain. operator, put me through to Number 4.
Don't take those off. Get out on the roof.
- But you can't see anything.
- You can listen.
If I couldn't hear you, I couldn't hear him.
Will you...? Hello, Larson?
MacLean. Any sign of Johnny yet?
Keep watching. Now go on, get out there on the roof.
- But if I can't see and hear...
- The wind will die down.
- Maybe the rain will stop. Go on.
- okay. oh, hello, Mr. Nolan. Hello, Murphy.
- Hello, give me the fire warden's tower.
- Hello, MacLean. Where's Dutton?
Under the bed. Where do you think?
- Hasn't he returned from Mercer?
- Shut up. Hank? MacLean.
Have you seen any sign of Johnny's plane? Keep watching, will you?
Yeah? When?
Well, why didn't you call me?
All right, all right.
- He just passed Number 3.
- That's good.
- Get those smoke fires going.
- What, in this rain?
He's gotta know the direction of the wind.
Wave your hat or point your finger. Go on.
Hello? Hello? oh, come on, come on.
- Is Dutton in any real danger?
- oh, no.
A half a ton of nitro behind him, a storm around him, no radio...
...and almost out of gas, so you know he's doing fine. oh, operator, operator...
Where have you been? oh, well, get me Number 2.
And call me back.
Yeah?
No, no, not yet.
I brought the money for the season's work.
There. That make you feel better?
When a man is missing in a storm, it looks like his number's up...
...the sight of money always makes me feel good.
Yeah? Well, keep trying, stupid.
- If you just sign this receipt...
- You sign it, I can't write.
- Mr. MacLean...
- Pipe down.
Really, Mr. MacLean, as superintendent, I demand a little...
Shut up!
There's a plane circling overhead. It must be Johnny. I'm going to the lake. oh, never mind that call, baby.
He made it. He made it, safe and sound. of course he made it. What were you worried about?
You worked up enough lather to shave all of Montreal.
Mr. MacLean, if you'll be kind enough to sign this receipt.
Why, certainly. This is the kiss-off, isn't it?
Except to take me to Number 5 and the engineer to Number 6.
- We'll get you there as soon as it clears.
- Thanks.
It's been a very pleasant association.
Simply divine.
Well, what like a trip had you?
What kind of a trip did you have?
- It's damp out or haven't you noticed?
- I wasn't paying attention.
You weren't paying attention?
You mean, you made me stay on that while you were here burning up that phone?
- I thought I saw Nolan leaving.
- He brought up the winter's graft, there. oh, real money. Look at that.
Four thousand a piece.
There's yours, Tiny. Brian.
Better count it.
Just right. I suppose you're gonna start that airline?
- Nothing can stop me now.
- Except one thing.
Somebody's gotta take
Nolan down to Number 5...
...somebody else has to ferry that engineer down to Number 6.
- That's simple. Let's cut for it.
- Right.
- Two low men, huh?
- All right.
I'll get the cards here.
- Go ahead.
- Ready?
- That does it.
- You're it.
I'm off in the morning.
If you want me, I'll be the drunkest man in the biggest hotel in ottawa.
Me too, if I ever get a chance to get out of here.
Come on, boys, I'm about to pour.
I'll have some of Mother Murphy's coffee.
Sure it'll take the chill out of your bones as well as the skin off your teeth.
You wouldn't like to stick around for a wedding?
- Whose?
- Mine.
Great for me, but I doubt if his nibs will.
If he had his choice between whiskeys and weddings, he'd take the whiskeys.
I'm gonna fly up to Lac vert Sunday to marry Emily.
- You're gonna marry Emily, huh?
- Yep.
What happens to the airline?
I'll pick up my brand-new secondhand planes in ottawa on the honeymoon.
- You marry Emily and...
- Will you pass the cow, please?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
"Marry Emily and" what?
Marry Emily, and you'll have no more airline than a jackrabbit.
Now, how much airline can a jackrabbit have?
What is this, a rib?
No, no, this is no rib. I wish it was.
I know what this airline means to you.
I've seen you think and plan it out all winter long.
I've watched you risk your neck a hundred times to get the $4000 to start it with.
- So what?
- So what?
Give Emily a whack at 4 grand and it'll go for gimcracks and fancy dresses.
- Everything but the airline. She'll see to it.
- You've said enough.
- Haven't said...
- Shut up.
- He was trying to warn you, maybe, Johnny.
-  You stay out of this.
Everybody knows about it but you.
I thought you'd get on to yourself, sucker.
- You know, she's nothing but a...
- Get up.
- You mean that?
- Get up!
That was no pleasure, but he's too big to fool with.
Give him a jolt of whiskey.
That was a business-like shellacking.
That won't stop him from marrying her.
No? Well, there is one other way.
Brian!
Take your time, sweet.
Johnny's coming down here Sunday to marry you.
Does that make you happy?
Well, here it is.
I'm going into town to buy myself $4000 worth of lights...
...and fun and horrible hangovers.
Wanna come along?
Hello, Dad.
- Where's Emily?
- She's gone.
- Gone?
- She left this morning.
Went with your friend MacLean.
- MacLean?
- Yes.
- Have a drink.
- Where did they go?
- The spit of her mother, she is.
- Where did they go?
- She's not worth the following.
- Tell me where?
To ottawa.
You're lucky to get a room in this town.
Everything's jammed to the doors. Army officers and so on.
Nix. Nix. You got a gallery.
That's all right. There isn't much I haven't seen.
The show is over as far as you're concerned. okay, mister. I'm not that interested.
Every time you open your mouth, you lose a dime off your tip.
- one more crack and I'd owe you money.
- That's right. oh, Brian, all these beautiful things.
I need some nutrition and you need something to slow you down.
Room service. Say, will you send us some ice, please?
I'm gonna unpack and change my clothes.
And setups for eight.
Yes. Thank you.
- You have Brian MacLean registered here?
- I'll see, sir.
- M-A-C-L-E-A-N.
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. MacLean is in 278, sir.
- Thanks.
Come in.
Hi, Johnny.
Where is she?
Room service, please.
Make that setups for 12, will you?
Yeah. oh, sweet, there's a drink coming up.
Brian.
Brian.
- Change. You're going back with me.
- You leave me alone.
I'm not going back. We're married.
- Are you hurt?
- No.
I'm all right.
- I'll get the doctor.
- oh, don't bother. He didn't hurt me.
Punching is something else he can't do.
Where's the party?
Why, we wouldn't think of starting without you. Step right in.
Thanks.
Have you contributed, young man?
Anything you care to give.
Twenty-five ought to be enough to get drunk on.
Bet this is the first time anyone gave you an airline.
Well, I...
Well, hasn't anybody seen Mr. MacLean yet?
Well, it seems mighty funny to me.
Where have you been? out.
I've been calling the police station, hospitals, everywhere.
I've got a right to know where you've been.
I've been looking for Johnny.
What did you want? Another beating?
I was gonna explain to him why I married you.
Why did you if you're gonna treat me like this?
So Johnny couldn't.
You'd have put Johnny behind the eight ball, kept him there.
You couldn't do that to me.
I've been around the block.
Well, anyway, here it is:
It's a bank roll.
Never let it be said that MacLean walked out on his wife and left her destitute.
- "Walked out"?
- Walked out.
Because of what you are and because of what I am, we wouldn't last 20 minutes.
- But you married me.
- That's what it said on the certificate.
You dirty, low-down, good-for-nothing... oh, now, don't say those mean, harsh things to your brand-new husband.
People might think we're not getting along.
Goodbye.
Don't get absent-minded and marry somebody else.
They have laws about that, you know. So long, sweet.
Sweet fraud.
"Dunkirk evacuation miracle.
Hundreds of thousands successfully retreat. "
Let's have a look at that, old boy.
"Every type of vessel used to evacuate our boys. "
- Must be a mess.
- A mess?
- It's a great show.
- What an army they must have, huh?
They've spent all their time and money on it for years.
I bet you they will lose.
He's just getting ready.
Then he will push them back and push them back...
...and push them back right into the ocean.
- Into the what?
- Into the ocean. The Pacific ocean.
Well, that's gonna be a long push, isn't it?
General Chiang Kai-shek can do it. oh, no, we are talking about another war. oh, oh, yes. That one.
Yes, but don't you bother about it.
- Excuse me.
- That's quite all right.
I'm depressed.
Anybody got a cigarette?
- Yes. Everybody but you.
- Thanks. on your feet, men.
- Brian.
- He is that pirate.
- How and where've you been?
- Up around Mistassini.
- You know MacLean.
- I've met him but I don't like him.
You should know how I don't like him.
Why do you say that? I've always been very happy to see you.
Tiny never used to like me, now he hates me.
- Willie.
- Hello. Happy landing. oh, come on and sit down.
Come on. Come on here.
Willie, we want four black coffees and some cake.
- Make mine tea and charge it.
- It sure is good to see you.
- Now, where's Johnny?
- I don't know. I haven't seen him.
Thought you'd be helping run that airline.
No, I haven't seen him since Port Wilson.
I waited for him to come back with
Emily and marry her, but he didn't.
- I don't know where he is.
- He changed his mind.
- You interested in a proposition?
- Whose back teeth did you steal?
Now, now. Be big.
I've got a little contract pegged out, flying a stand mill a piece at a time.
My plane isn't big enough to handle the job...
...so if you wanna chip in a couple of hundred bucks apiece...
...I'll swap my plane in for a secondhand twin-motor job and...
A couple of hundred bucks. Is there that much?
How should I know?
Well, last time I saw you, you had 4000.
The last time I saw you, we both had 4000.
What happened to yours?
- How about you?
- I have no money, he's trying to borrow it.
You can't say I didn't try, can you?
- Sir?
- Coffee.
- Quiet, please.
- Even though...
...many large tracks of Europe...
...and many old and famous states have fallen...
...or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo...
...and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule...
...we shall not flag or fail.
We shall go on to the end.
We shall fight in France.
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
We shall fight on the beaches.
We shall fight on the landing grounds.
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
We shall fight in the hills.
We shall never surrender.
And even if... Which I do not for a moment believe.
- this island or any part of it...
...were subjugated and starving...
...then our empire beyond the seas...
...armed and guarded by the British fleet...
...would carry on the struggle...
...until, in God's good time...
...the New World, with all its power and might...
...steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the Old.
You have just heard the prime minister, the Right Honorable Winston Churchill.
There's a man who knows how to word an invitation.
I don't know how you feel...
...but I've taken a sudden dislike to these clothes.
And as a matter of fact, looking about me...
...I think we'd all benefit by a change.
Correct me if I'm wrong...
...but I seem to have heard something about a government station at Uplands.
That's the rumor.
Well, what are we gonna do? Waste the evening here? oh, Willie, got change for a watch?
I hold it for you. Happy landing.
- So long, Willie.
- So long.
- That's funny.
- What is it?
Four civilian aircrafts, sir, as though they're coming in for a landing.
Tell those men they're on the wrong part of field.
Yes, sir.
Give me the chief flying instructor, please.
What? No band? or didn't you boys expect us? oh, hey, Blimp. Blimp. Get a load of them machines.
They're thicker than mosquitoes down at Three Mile Lake.
Give me one of them and a bottle of wine and I finish the war.
And tell your mothers you saw some fliers.
All right, men, don't crowd here. Get to work.
Come on, Scrounger, get in formation.
Carry on.
What's the trouble? What are these aircrafts doing here?
Dropped in to see if you could use fliers.
Place to apply is the nearest recruiting center.
You'd better take your aircraft off this tarmac.
They're not in the way. Why...?
- Sergeant major.
- Sir?
If these aircrafts are not removed, put these men under arrest for trespassing.
- Yes, sir.
- Trespassing?
- Now, look here, general, if you just ask...
- I'm not asking. I'm ordering.
You're interfering with our training.
- Hurry them up, sergeant major.
- Yes, sir.
- Hurry up.
- I thought that they wanted fliers.
They don't even seem interested.
Step into it. We got work to do.
Now, take it easy. I don't believe you happen to know who we are.
You'll find out who we are if you don't get going.
- Fyffe, get those planes off the field.
- Yes, sir.
Now, hurry up. Get going. Get out of here.
That... That changes it.
That changes everything.
- Hurry it up. Hurry it up.
- Scrounger!
Get to work.
Don't send out your laundry. We're not staying.
I see from your medical history sheets that you're pretty fit.
I want a record of your flying hours, if any.
I've had... I've had about four...
Just a moment, please. one at a time. Mr. Prentiss?
Well, I've ridden in planes as a passenger.
- Mr. Burton?
- Sixteen hours solo, sir.
- Mr. Harris?
- Four thousand three hundred and five.
Mr. Lebec?
About the same. Four thousand four hundred.
- Mr. Murphy? -
Fifty-eight hundred.
- Mr. MacLean?
- oh, 6000 or 6500.
You four are bush fliers, I take it.
That is what we have been told.
You'll have to start over again just the same as the other recruits.
If you'll wait in the outer office, please. outside, rookie.
Mr. Bradley, Mr. Harris, Mr. Hunter,
Mr. Lebec, Mr. MacLean and Mr. Murphy.
- Will you step in here, please?
- Schicklgruber, here we come.
Give him your regards.
These are the civilian pilots up from AMP for interview.
Thank you, Corporal Harley. That's all.
Well, I'm very glad to see you fellows. Have a cigarette.
Sit down.
You've been sent up to training division because of your lengthy experience.
There's Mr. Bradley and Mr. Hunter, airlines. The rest of you, bush flying.
We fully realize how anxious all you chaps are to get overseas for active combat flying.
In fact, if you weren't, we wouldn't want you in the RCAF.
But you are wanted, I can assure you.
But pilots of your experience will be invaluable in training younger men.
Men who are physically capable of taking a 7 G dive without blacking out.
- Men who can retain consciousness...
- Just a minute, please.
- What kind of a runaround are you giving us?
- This is no runaround.
You're being offered to take the service training course...
...and be a part of the British
Commonwealth Air Training Plan.
- I signed up because I wanted to fight.
- Yeah, me too.
None of this kindergarten-teacher stuff.
It seems to me that we're being led up the garden path.
Thanks very much. Tell us where we can go to become fighter pilots.
I'm afraid that's out of the question. You see, you're too old.
We have no pilots doing combat flying over 26.
I'm too old?
You're telling me I'm too old?
Listen, I've been flying the bush all winter. That's no job for an old man.
Sorry, fellas. I know exactly how you feel, but there it is.
You know how we feel.
What does a chair warmer know about piloting a plane?
- our exhaustive medical research has...
- Exhaustive medical bourgeois.
Why don't you turn the air force over to the fliers, go back where you belong?
I can't, Mr. MacLean. You see, my home was in Coventry.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
But unfortunately, our medical research is correct. I happen to know.
I may be what you regard as a chair warmer now...
...but a few months ago, I was flying with my squadron on fighter patrol...
...over the English Channel at 30,000 feet.
I'm 28 years old.
Yet I'm too old for combat flying.
I found that out at Dunkirk.
I got on the tail of a Messerschmitt 110.
He dived and I went after him at about 500 mph.
I got quite close to him. Just a mere kid, about 20 years old.
When he pulled out of the dive, we must, both of us, have blacked out.
He was younger than I.
He came out of the blackout about a second before I did.
Had his sights on me. Next thing I knew, I was hurtling down, half my tail shot away.
I pulled the old umbrella...
...and I'm lucky enough to be alive to tell the tale.
No, gentlemen, modern air fighting is a young man's game.
All right, out of that truck.
Right up, men. Step lively.
Right up, come on.
I'll never get my arms up that high.
I have a feeling this is gonna be my permanent address.
- You're gonna be buried here?
- Come along. Join the rest.
- That's it.
- Needles and hypos and books on the opera.
Left. Left. Left, right, left.
Heads up. Swing those arms high.
- Left.
- I don't like his attitude.
- It's your fault.
- What do you mean it's my fault?
You're too big for the planes...
...so they gotta keep marching us till they wear your legs off.
Stop that gabbing!
- Left, right, left.
- I wonder if they stop for tea.
Left. Right. Come on, men, bring it in there.
Close it up. Left, left.
All student instructors, report to me.
Now, listen, men.
I understand some of you have thousands of hours' flying time.
Your instructor will have to treat you as if you were beginners.
You're training to be instructors.
Therefore, you'll have to adapt yourself to the RCAF manner of flying.
I know you'll all have the good sense to accept this situation without resentment.
- Bohat?
- Sir.
Plane 77.
- MacLean?
- Sir.
Plane 42.
- Witchell?
- Yes, sir?
Plane 86.
- Lebec? Plane 14.
- Yes, sir.
- Murphy? Plane 15.
- Yes.
- Goloshoroy?
- Yes, sir.
Plane 45.
MacLean reporting, sir.
Well, Johnny. What happened to the airline?
What are you doing here?
They're gonna make an instructor out of me. But I have other plans.
What about Emily?
Well, what about her?
You gave up an unborn airline for king and country, didn't you?
You walked out on her, is that it?
I guess you could call it that. or is it any of your business?
You're right. It's not any of my business now.
Get in the front cockpit.
- Switches off, sir.
- Switches off.
- Gas on.
- Gas on.
- Suck in.
- Suck in.
Throttle set.
Throttle set.
This flight is to find out how well you can fly.
Level off at 4000 feet and
I'll tell you what to do.
That will be nice.
- Contact, sir.
- Contact.
Make a 360-degree slow turn to the right.
I thought we came up here to fly.
A slow turn to the right, MacLean.
Yes, sir.
- What lake a trip had you?
- What?
- Anything else you want me to show you?
- Yeah, a slow turn to the right.
You may be great circus flier, but you have to learn to fly in formation.
Yes, sir. Now, what was it you wanted me to do?
A slow turn to the right.
A slow turn to the right. very good, sir.
Well, how do you like it? oh, exciting.
Isn't it?
Harris, B.E. He's your man, isn't he?
Yes, and he's all right. I'll pass him.
- Murphy. Francis Patrick Murphy.
- Better known as "Tiny. " one of my men.
- I'm afraid it's a no vote.
- Anything definite?
Hits the bottle. out?
Johnny, what about MacLean?
He's good, but he can't explain how he does it.
His paperwork is adequate.
He's not the instructor type. All he wants is to get across and fight.
Don't we all?
I'd hate to see him out of the service.
He can fly circles around anyone here.
Perhaps he'd make a good staff pilot for Jarvis.
Yes, I think he would. Let's try him.
- How was that, sir?
- oh, that was all right.
You did everything according to the rules, which is fine in peacetime.
But in a war, it doesn't work out that way. You've gotta get on top of your enemy.
Pick your time, close in, let him have it.
You'll develop an instinct.
When you get it, use it.
Let's make another run, sir.
I've half a beltful left.
All right, we'll do one starting at 800 feet. Right?
- Well, nice shooting, son.
- Do you really think so, sir?
Been chauffeuring target-splashers for months and haven't seen better.
- Well, that's very encouraging to hear.
- Chief pilot's compliments.
May you report to the new flight commander's office?
- Another one?
- Yes, sir.
- Write your name on the target tomorrow.
- oh, thank you, sir.
Been paying respects to the new boss?
- What's he like? Spit-and-polish fanatic? - No, seems regular.
That's strange coming from you.
- Flying officer MacLean, sir.
- Hello.
Well, so you're the new boss.
- Following me around?
- I don't think I have to tell you.
If I could help it, I wouldn't be in the same province.
I suppose you had a juicy account of all my shortcomings from Richards?
How I undermine dial readers, telling them to fly by the seats of their pants.
- He mentioned it.
- Won't have any trouble on that score.
The only way to teach kids to fly...
Teach them to obey orders and fly according to the plan.
It's your job to keep it working. I don't like red tape.
But this instinct-flying patter will only tear down our whole training system.
You've gotta stop it.
Might've known you'd make noise like a brass hat.
What do I do? Hand in my resignation?
Wait for you to have me kicked out?
You do your job according to RCAF rules. I'll do mine. That's all.
Yes, sir.
Computed height, 6200 feet.
Computed air speed, 185 mph.
Right.
Left. Left.
Steady.
- Second course, ready.
- Second course, steady.
Ninety-degree method finished.
Wind speed, 22 mph.
Direction, 165 degrees.
- Ready to bomb.
- Target.
That factory east of the river, directly ahead.
- Attack.
- Attack.
Right. Left. Left, steady.
Number 1 bomb gone. on target.
Number 2 bomb gone.
Number 3 bomb gone.
Number 4 bomb gone.
Alabama, you're way off your target.
You'll have to do better. Find the wind to make another run.
Yes, sir.
- About to drop a few eggs, Alabama?
- May be the last bombing flight I have, sir.
If I don't report better, I may be trading these goggles for a service rifle.
- It isn't as bad as all that, is it?
- oh, just about.
The chief instructor told me that the prescribed course of training demands... oh, you had the makings of the best pilot in the outfit before you ever knew a rule.
Well, thank you, sir.
There is such a thing as instinct, you know.
- Come on.
- oh, but where...?
- Get in the rear cockpit.
- But this is a solo flight.
Get in the rear cockpit, buckle up and keep your head down.
Here, you take this.
I'll swim.
You are going to report a bombing score that will make history around here.
- Ready, Alabama?
- Yes, sir.
Here we go.
Hadn't we better pull out sooner?
We're coming close to those bomb bursts. oh, pay no attention. I've dodged worse than that in my day.
I'll make it this time, or
I go back to the bush. Yeah.
Mr. MacLean, you're going too low.
If those bomb splinters ever hit us...
Leave that to me.
I'll smack one dead center if I have to land on that target. Take a deep breath.
Prentiss. open your cockpit and unstrap your chute. We're headed for the ditch.
Are you ready? Prentiss!
Prentiss!
"The court finds that the accused,
Flying officer Brian MacLean...
...number C-1969 of No. 1 Bombing and Gunnery school, Jarvis, ontario...
...did neglect to obey
Station Standing orders.
For when on active service on the 12th day of April, 1941...
...he, when a flying officer in the vicinity of Number 4 bombing target...
...did engage in unauthorized low flying.
This act was contrary to Part 8,
Page 5 of Station Standing orders.
And as a result of it, leading aircraftsman
Louis Prentiss, suffered severe injuries...
...and damage was done to aircraft Harvard number 622-78J, property of the Crown.
Therefore, the finding of this court
- martial...
...is that the accused is guilty as charged. "
Do you wish to address the court?
No, sir.
"The court sentenced the accused to be dismissed from His Majesty's service. "
Court is now closed.
Papers here. Read all about it.
Read all the latest news, sir.
Want a paper, sir? Paper, sir?
Read all about it. All the latest new...
- Say, is there any gents in the backroom?
- Can't you hear them?
- You think they would wanna buy papers?
- They might. They've been there all day.
- oh, popcorn.
- Hey, that's for customers.
Bless them all, bless them all
The short and the wide and the tall
Bless the instructors Who teach us to dive
They say that we're lucky
'Cause we're still alive
And if ever the engine should stall
We're in for a heck of a fall
No sweet peas or violets
For flat-footed pilots
So cheer up my lads and bless them all
Bless them all, bless them all
The short and the wide and the tall
- I beg your pardon, gents.
- What's...?
- Paper, sir?
- What's in it?
All the latest war news.
Bombing of London. Bombing of the ports.
RAF strikes back.
- Don't want it. Ain't my war.
- It ain't my war too.
And you know why it ain't my war?
Because I fly by the set of my pants, because I'm too old.
They say you gotta watch those little things and keep your eyes on the instrument.
So I'm out, you hear? I'm out. Now, you look like a nice, young fella.
So take my advice and keep away from the air force. You hear me?
Keep away from the air force.
Sure, want a paper?
Same one?
Do you want a paper, sir?
- No. It ain't my war too.
- I'll take it.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir. Thanks. oh, don't read that. Ain't our war.
I'm not reading the war news.
I'm looking at the pictures.
There's a picture of a man who knows all about flying.
- He's the man we should have seen.
- Who?
- Billy. Billy Bishop. There's his picture.
- oh, Billy Bishop. of course.
Certainly. He was an ace in the last war.
Yes, sir. He flew by the seat of his pants and he was an ace. Shot down 72 planes.
An air marshal in this war.
A very important man. Yeah.
"Air Marshal Bishop. victoria Cross,
Distinguished Service order, Military Cross.
Distinguished Flying Cross,
Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.
Croix de Guerre with palm.
Will present wings to pilots at Uplands. "
Present wings. Nice little white wings. And what have we got?
We got a bottle.
Yeah, but you can't fly a bottle. As a matter of fact, we can't fly anything.
You know why?
Because they said so. We're too old.
That's exactly what the men said.
Brother Tiny, one of these days, I'm going to show Billy Bishop how I can fly.
I'm going to power-dive right over his head and I'm going to yell to him:
"Billy Bishop. Billy Bishop. Watch me fly. Watch Brian MacLean fly. "
You and me both.
- But you can't.
- Why?
Because you haven't got a plane.
You told me so yourself. You sold it.
Yes, I got a plane. Popcorn
Kearns has gone to the States.
He says I can use his plane till he gets back. Good old Popcorn.
I like Popcorn.
Nice little white wings.
I thought they were very becoming.
It's a grand thing to see old soldiers like you back in the conflict.
- How old are you?
- Thirty-eight, sir.
You must have been about
11 or 12 in the last war.
Yes, sir.
Men...
...the wings which I am about to present you...
...are a flying insignia with great traditions behind it.
You have earned them after a long and arduous period of training...
...and they proclaim to the world...
...that you have accomplished your first job.
That you're entitled to undertake tremendous responsibilities.
These wings are the symbol of gallantry.
You go forth from here highly accomplished pilots.
Your training has been equal to and better...
...than anything that the enemy can provide.
In a short time, and possibly in a very short time...
...you will be, and we all envy you...
...in active contact with the enemy.
When you are in contact with that enemy...
...I want you to remember that we here at home...
...are determined that you will have the fullest help and support...
...that it is in our own power to give you.
We will never let you down.
I am so glad to see here today...
...you men from the British Isles...
...along with our Canadians...
...you men from loyal Quebec...
...from the great plains of
Manitoba and Saskatchewan...
...from British Columbia in the far west and from all other provinces.
But also you who are from our great sister dominions...
...Australia and New Zealand.
And those of you who have come from as far as the Argentine.
Also, you gallant lads from the United States...
...who have come up here to help and serve with us.
It now gives me great pleasure to award you your wings.
I know that you will always be proud to wear them...
...and I know that the force will always be proud...
...that you have them on your chest.
Thank you, sir.
Wings parade, stand at ease.
Carry on, flight lieutenant.
LAC Walnut.
Special distinction.
- Where are you from, Walnut?
- Yukon Territory, sir.
- You've come a long way.
- Yes, sir.
I suppose you're very anxious to get a much longer way.
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck to you, boy.
Thank you, sir.
LAC Knight Brown. Special distinction.
Knight Brown.
Proud to see you here in the uniform of Australia.
- What part do you come from?
- Sydney, sir.
- Well, good luck to you, my boy.
- Thank you very much, sir. oh, Billy! Billy!
Don't pay any attention to us. Just ignore us.
Bless them all, bless them all
- Carry on, flight lieutenant.
- LAC Grew.
Distinguished pass.
- Where are you from, Grew?
- Texas, sir.
- one of our most loyal provinces.
- We think so, sir.
- Well, I think so too.
- Thank you.
And we thank you for coming up here and helping us.
Get the registration markings on those. very good, sir.
Billy, take off your hat, we'll give you a haircut.
Now you're showing them, Tiny.
Tiny, pull out, that's enough!
Pull out, Tiny! Tiny!
I wonder who he was.
It's Kearns. Popcorn Kearns.
I know his plane.
On with your helmets On with your motors
Tune them up and let them sing
Take them off and let them swing high
Painting a V across the sky
A V for a victory by and by
Hey, look.
You're off for the big show tonight
So fly them wing to wing
You're angels of hell and you fight
For country and for king
Hello, Scrounger. Hello, Blimp.
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hello.
I saw you when you came in.
Nice to see all of you again.
- You look very beautiful.
- Won't you sit down, Emily? oh, no, thank you.
Johnny, would you like to buy me a drink? over there? of course. Excuse me.
I don't know. I'm depressed somehow.
Give me a cigarette, will you?
You're smoking one now. oh, am I? Well, so I am. Thanks.
No, thank you.
I thought you wanted a drink.
Johnny, where's Brian?
I don't know.
He was cashiered from the service.
He pulled a silly trick and lost all his civilian license.
Well, flying's the only thing he knows.
With his license gone, what he's gonna do?
He'll take care of himself. He always has. You ought to know that.
- Excuse me. Squadron leader Dutton?
- Yes.
All officers are to report back to the station.
- What's up?
- I don't know, but it's urgent.
They want all available staff pilots and instructors right away.
You officers from Upland?
- Wait, Johnny.
- You heard what the provost marshal said.
Don't go.
Please sit down.
Please.
Brian never told you why he married me, did he?
- Pretty obvious, isn't it?
- To everyone but you.
What do you mean?
Listen, Johnny.
Brian married me for only one reason: to keep me from marrying you.
What?
To keep me from making a mess of your life.
And I would have. Believe me, I would have.
He was in love with you.
So much so that he left me after we were married.
As soon as he knew you were safe from me, I never saw him again.
Took a lot upon himself to protect me.
Yes, that was pretty drastic for Brian, marriage.
I guess it was the only thing he could think of to break us up.
Do you still care for him?
He was my kind of person.
We understood each other.
Don't you see, Johnny? You owe Brian a lot.
I think I understand.
Well, won't you try to find him? Won't you try to help him?
I'll do whatever I can.
Thanks.
- Those are your orders.
- very good, sir.
Well, come on. Things seem to be popping.
My first real dinner in a month and I never got past the shrimp.
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.
The check. For this gentleman.
You're off for the big show tonight
So fly them wing to wing
You're angels of hell and you fight
For country and for king
You're captains of the clouds
Let 'er roll, you're on your way
Hit the sky again, fly again, try gain
Till the flag's on high again
Captains of the clouds
All officers present, sir.
At ease, please.
Well, gentlemen, we've just received some pretty bad news.
Two transport planes, carrying 44 transatlantic pilots to Canada...
...have crashed.
This loss could hardly have occurred at a worse time...
...for we've just received a call...
...for every available Lockheed
Hudson bomber to be sent over at once.
Headquarters have ordered me to send all the pilots we can spare.
So you men are leaving tonight for
Newfoundland, your taking-off place.
I cannot stress too strongly...
...the vital and immediate necessity of getting those planes over.
No obstacle, breakdown, weather, enemy action must stop you.
You've got to get them through.
Thank you, gentlemen.
- Squadron Leader Dutton?
- Here, sir.
- Flight Lieutenant Ainsley?
- Sir.
- Flight Lieutenant Anderson?
- Sir.
- Flight Lieutenant Lebec.
- Yes, sir.
- Flying officer Benson?
- Sir.
- Flying officer Durant?
- Sir.
- Flying officer Fitzgerald.
- Here, sir.
- Flying officer Nolan.
- Here, sir.
- And Flying officer olsen.
- Here, sir.
I beg you pardon, sir. I don't think I heard my name called, sir.
- You didn't.
- But, sir?
Flight Lieutenant Harris...
...it's obvious we can't completely unman this station of officers.
But England is my home, sir. And I thought I might...
I don't ask to pilot a plane but I'd do anything to go.
I thought I might, perhaps, navigate for one of the civilian pilots.
I think I know how you feel.
- Flight Lieutenant Wood?
- oh, yes, sir?
Put Flight Lieutenant Harris on the list as a navigator.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you. oh, I'm sorry, boys.
Digby 428 to tower. Circling field. Permission to land?
Plane's coming in from Uplands now, sir.
Tell them to come on in.
Use east-to-west runway.
Tower to Digby 428. Come along in. Use east- to-west runway.
You have each been given a copy of chart number 2059...
...and map number 51...
...on which the course you're to take has been laid out.
Study your charts carefully, gentlemen.
You'll see that your course carries you through Area D.
You'll receive a position report:
Longitude 30, 41 West.
Latitude 49, 28 North.
This is considered the area of greatest danger. once you pass this, all should be plain sailing.
Each squadron, in command of a squadron leader...
...will consists of five flights of five bombers each.
Number 1 of each will be in charge of a lieutenant.
Numbers 2 and 3 will be flown by RCAF personnel...
...and Numbers 4 and 5, by civilian pilots.
- Is that all quite clear?
- Yes, sir.
Carry on, then. And good luck.
Thank you, sir.
See you in the air.
- Walter Billings?
- Sir.
- Dumont?
- Here. Here, sir.
- You're with Flight Lieutenant James.
- Let's go.
- Norman Holdsworth.
- Here, sir.
- Robert Monroe.
- Right here.
Go with Flight Lieutenant Holt.
- Richard Henderson?
- Yes, sir.
- Martin Crowley?
- Yes, sir.
- You're with Flight Lieutenant Tucker.
- Come with me.
- Philip Cranbrook.
- That's me, sir.
Go with the Squadron Leader Dutton.
You and Francis Patrick Murphy.
- Tiny.
- Here.
Francis Patrick Murphy.
- Irish?
- Close, thank you, sir.
Squadron Leader Dutton, here are your pilots.
- All right, let's go.
- Pierson. Ronald Pierson?
- Yes, sir.
- Ferguson. Albert Ferguson.
- Cranbrook?
- Yes, sir.
You'll fly Aircraft 39.
It's warming up for you. very good, sir.
McCord? William McCord? Go with...
I wanna talk to you alone.
- Gibbons? Harold Gibbons?
- Here, sir.
Close the door.
Well, go ahead. Sound off. This ought to make you feel pretty good.
It sure does. We have a few things to straighten out.
Now, let's try to stick to one of them, huh?
Do I fly that bomber?
There's something else.
Not for me there, isn't it.
Now, look, fella. There's nothing left for me this side of the ocean.
I know that. I'm all washed out.
But with the RAF, I may get a crack at another start. Who knows?
There's one slim chance
I can get even for Tiny.
- For Tiny?
- Yes.
He was the one that was killed at the wings ceremony at Uplands.
He was flying Popcorn's plane. You saw him crash.
- That was Tiny?
- Yeah.
I was responsible. It was all my fault.
I went through his things.
He didn't have relatives.
So I took all his papers and here I am.
And there's only one thing that's important: that I fly that bomber.
Are you gonna stop me?
Nobody's gonna stop you.
But that other thing, I...
I saw Emily in ottawa.
She told me why you married her.
You fly number 21.
Scrounger's your navigator.
- old home week, huh?
- Practically.
Listen, Mr. Murphy. If you don't keep your eyes on those dials...
...I'm gonna punch a real hole in your head.
Been taking lessons?
Number 53 to tower. Ready to take off.
Tower to 53. Wait a minute.
We'll give you the signal.
Give him the Aldis light.
Here we are.
We're making better time than I thought. Must have a strong tailwind.
Yeah, must have.
Keep a good radio watch, but don't use the transmitter.
We have to keep WT silence.
Why don't you pull that cot and get some sleep.
No, I'm not tired. Besides, I don't wanna miss the first sight of England.
I'll call you when we pass Ireland.
Ireland. All out for Ireland.
Next stop England. Change for the Berlin shuttle.
What I want to know is what they'll do with us after they get us there.
Probably send us back by boat. oh, no, not me.
I don't risk my life on no boat.
You needn't worry. They'll have to keep you to fly this bomber.
- You think so?
- Positive.
After the trouble you had getting in that seat...
...you're part of the fixtures.
Seems to be getting light early.
We're going east so fast I've lost all track of time change.
Sunrise was 0612 GMT.
Six-twelve.
We're only a couple of hours out.
Fish and chips for tea, my lads.
Cigarette?
- Yours?
- No, yours. oh, thank you.
Say, take a good look at me, will you?
- Scrounger, that's asking too much.
- No, seriously.
Imagine what I looked like 12 years ago without a mustache.
- Got it?
- I think so.
If you'd known me then, do you think you'd recognize me now?
- Probably, why?
- oh, dear, very upsetting.
When I left London, I owed so much money to so many chaps.
Coffee.
Maybe you'd like to get out and take a little walk?
Seven hours in a plane is enough to tire anyone.
Not me. I would like to keep right on flying.
Right over Berlin. You bet.
I would like to give Mr. Schicklboob...
...some of that... with the bombs and little bit of that... with the guns.
That's why they don't put any fighting equipment in these ships.
They wanna get them to England, not have fellas like you looking for trouble.
Can I help it if I have fighting blood in my veins?
What's it like, Scrounger?
What's what like?
Your home? Your part of England?
The same as any other part of England.
It's... Well, it's England.
Narrow lanes, high hedges, thatched cottages and all that?
That's right. That's Devon.
I lived there till I was nearly 20.
If ever I get enough money together,
I'm going to buy that house.
I never tagged you for a home-loving person.
It isn't that, but when you've been away for a long time, you...
You remember things.
- Like what?
- oh, I don't know.
Playing darts in the village pub.
Looking forward to that.
A mug of mild and bitter.
Looking forward to that too.
Weekends on the river.
And larks singing high over the moors.
Beastly little nuisances, but nice.
You know, all the things you remember when you think about England.
Funny. I had a hunch I was never gonna see it again until this chance popped along.
Just shows you how much a fellow can depend on hunches.
You'll be hearing those larks in an hour or so.
- Hope so. Little more coffee?
- Yeah, just a spot.
We should be sighting land very soon.
Where there's a country lane
- What's the matter? Spot something?
- I'm not sure.
I thought I saw a reflection. Something shining.
It's a Messerschmitt, a 109.
Hudson 53 to A Flight. Full throttle, climb for cloud formation.
He's got Blimp.
It's all right. He just got my cigarette.
Scrounger. Scrounger.
Scrounger.
Johnny, he got Scrounger.
Cease communication. Maintain radio silence.
- Plane 21, hold your position.
- Sorry, I've got an appointment.
I've got a date to meet Fritzie.
We're not gonna hold still for that, are we?
Brian, rejoin the formation.
No. He'd pick us off one at a time.
Us and all the squadrons following.
Brian, obey orders.
I'm not disobeying orders,
I just can't hear you.
Brian.
I think he's onto us, Scrounger.
Hold still, heinie.
Bearing 020 degrees.
The landfall bearing 020 degrees, straight ahead of you, gentlemen...
...is England.
We shall go on to the end.
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
We shall fight with growing confidence...
...and growing strength in the air.
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
We shall never surrender.
[ENGLISH]
STORMY WATERS
Get on. You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I'm ill because of the food.
Besides, it's their fault.
I'd told Poubennec:
"We should've done your wedding aboard the Cyclone."
Then I'd have done the cooking.
You're not fit to talk to me!
You're not a man.
How do you mean?
You cook for the Dutch.
You're no longer a man or a cook.
A potato is what you are.
A spud.
That's right, you're a spud.
Shut up, cook.
Let the doctor speak.
Okay, I'll let him speak.
A sailor's marriage isn't like any other marriage.
As the poet said, every sailor has two wives:
His own and the sea.
Still you mustn't be jealous, ladies.
The sea isn't a mean mistress, even when she's rough.
And if your husband's with her, he's faithful to you.
The things Maulette comes up with...
Now, I propose a toast to the health of the newlyweds.
And here's to the crew of the Cyclone, the bravest crew in Brest.
Valiant rescuers, whose certificates and medals prove...
Please, Doctor.
I heard that at the Sorbonne.
Whatever you say, Captain.
Here's a toast to Captain Laurent and his charming wife.
Hurray for the Captain, for one finds captains both in Brest and all over the world.
And good captains they are.
Excellent captains even.
But a captain like yours, gentlemen, has no equals.
The mold he was cast in got broken.
Captain, your speech.
Nothing to say.
Forgive me.
Say something, they'll like it.
The doctor spoke like a book.
I've nothing to tell,
I'm no storyteller.
Poubennec's married.
He's happy, so is his wife.
So we're all happy.
What else is there to say?
I propose a toast to those who are on duty on the Cyclone.
And in the memory of those who were here once and have left us.
No more speeches. This is a wedding.
We're here to be merry!
Let's dance.
May I dance with the bride?
Of course, your Cyclone is a good tug. I don't deny that.
But the Dutch is good as well.
She's new and she's fast.
And I mean "fast".
So what? We get there first.
You must admit she's quite a competitor.
They play a trick on us, we pay them back double.
Goes with this blasted business.
Don't complain.
Saving lives is a beautiful job.
- Talk about a beautiful job...
- Lives don't pay, but you also have the boat...
A boat, when you've hooked it, you're in for a lot of money.
It's harder than simply hooking it.
Must moor it to the quay.
Plus, we handle the charcoal, the damage... all the hassle.
All that means risks.
And then the good weather, it spells unemployment for us.
A storm a day, that'd be too good.
Poubennec, give me my wife back.
Yours has nice eyes and is a good dancer.
That's easy with a partner like you.
You are a good dancer, we haven't danced together for so long.
I was there watching you, thinking it still feels the way it did ten years ago.
I felt so good.
I love you so much, Andre.
Why are you so sad all of a sudden?
I'm not at all sad.
But I love you and I know you love me.
You men don't understand these things.
What things?
For instance, that we can feel so entirely happy, and still feel like crying.
It's a fine time for crying...
We have fun at a wedding!
Go on, tell me what's wrong.
Don't be mad because I'm nervous.
Sometimes I get so worried.
Worried? What do you worry about?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean?
Well, your job, the boat, the sea...
The sea?
That's new!
It isn't.
I've always felt this way.
And you know it.
I stop living when you're at sea.
At sea! You're making me laugh.
There was a time when I'd be away for months, but nowadays
I practically go nowhere.
Our house is here, the boat's round the corner.
Only short cruises alongside the quay.
We only go out when we're needed.
Which means danger.
Look in the corners, you'll find lovers.
They look like newlyweds themselves.
Hey, take a look at Tanguy's wife with Le Gall.
Quite an edifying show!
What's he doing?
Talking and talking.
Honestly, I wouldn't want
Tanguy to butt me.
Because if he did, he'd gore me alright with his horns.
There's a pump by the kitchen.
Go rinse your head and get back when you're sober.
Go on, do it.
What's the matter?
It's nothing.
Fancy a dance?
- No more tears?
- No. It was a passing cloud.
Captain Laurent, please.
Go on, Mr. Holland!
Nothing like this to put your wits back together.
Leave it, I'm tired.
Here I am, Mr. Tanguy.
I'll handle the expenses.
Stop being silly, it's an SOS.
We'll cast off.
What are you doing? You're crazy!
That's my truck!
Never doubted that.
I know, Mrs Laurent.
That's his job...
Still, on a day like today...
Don't complain, Marie.
We're married.
If it'd been yesterday, there'd have been no wedding.
Hurry up, old man.
Don't fret,
I won't leave her alone tonight.
If you see my wife, tell her I said good-bye. I love her.
Let's go. Everyone's here?
Where's Le Gall?
Yes, where's he gone?
We can't wait, old man. Let's go.
What boat is it?
Mirvakin, 6,000 tons, broken rudder.
- 44-46 north. 6'50" west.
- That's all?
Good. Send a signal.
From Cyclone, ocean tug.
1,800 H.P. Coming out for you.
Ready to go about?
Keep the bike till tomorrow.
60 revs ahead.
Where were you?
- My business.
- Also concerns me.
People look for me, they can find me.
You won't say where you were?
Everyone knows, but Tanguy.
He's my second.
His wife can do whatever she likes, but not with members of my crew, understand?
I was away 15 minutes.
You know what those 15 minutes mean?
We risk everything for 5 minutes.
Next time, you go.
Get along now!
Port ten. You're going off course!
Mirvakin accepts on Loyd terms.
No share no pay.
Confirm it. I'll take the risk.
Gouedic, just one thing, hot drinks for everyone all night.
I left it open!
What a mess!
Andre's certificate!
His latest one!
He's saved many people.
But the bad weather takes its revenge.
You know,
I used to look at that photo and think I'd also marry some day.
You both still look the same.
When you're in love,
10 years go by so fast!
- You were also happy that day.
- That day.
But a week later,
Andre went to Chile for 6 months.
Our honeymoon trip.
Your dress looks like mine, despite fashion.
A white dress is a white dress.
What's most like a bride?
Another bride.
Are you ill?
No, it's nothing.
Heart flutter. I've always had it, since I was a child.
Have you seen the doctor?
Doctor Maulette likes me.
Someone who likes you can't imagine you're ill.
Tonight I told Andre I was worried.
He laughed.
He can laugh, he's strong.
And he has things:
His boat, the sea...
I only have him.
I wish we could go away.
It's sad here!
We're surrounded by memories, portraits, letters, certificates...
Couples shouldn't keep things.
We should live, love, be together...
When something nice happens, we say:
"I'll never forget this moment," as we know it won't last.
Besides, I'm fed up.
I'm ill, I'm afraid...
Yes, I'm talking nonsense, Marie.
I'm afraid of dying alone.
One day, when Andre's away at sea, he won't be here to kiss me and tell me that he's always loved me.
Feed that fire!
I'm telling you.
When the eyes start popping out in the broth, you're going too fast.
The eyes?
But your casserole has no eyes. It's blind.
Still on cloud nine with the bride.
You must admit it was quite a wedding, everything was going well.
Then something went wrong, it had to be at my wedding.
I'll only admit this:
I'm not married.
I wasn't trying to discourage you.
Faithful women must exist.
After all, one can even find two-headed sheep and three-legged snakes.
Captain,
I'm tired of this cuckold talk.
I feel like drowning them in the broth.
They're only having a laugh.
I don't care,
I'm tired of these jokes.
That grumpiness means Tanguy's afraid of losing his mast.
Royer, you always come up with the stupidest jokes.
And they never change!
With all my respect,
I don't disturb your reading.
Why do you listen to me?
I may listen, read or eat, the contents are always demoralizing.
Good job it's such foul weather, but for it, best thing to do would be to jump overboard.
Very intelligent. Let's see...
All that reading, you'll end up doing something silly.
I prefer you plastered, a lesser evil.
Where are you off to?
Get all hands.
I'll be in the wheelhouse.
What are they saying?
Say something.
Answer me, dammit!
Keeps saying the same thing:
"Near you. Prepare towrope."
The towrope?
Look at them!
They're like old sacks.
Like insects.
They're worse than beasts.
What? Won't you listen?
They'll miss the tow!
For God's sake, Charles, wake them up!
What am I supposed to do.
They won't budge!
Bunch of dirty bastards!
Let him fix the cable himself.
And go in the water with it.
He got us here. He must save us!
You shouldn't talk so!
Why not? We'll die anyway!
I'd hate to die like this.
- We can lower a raft.
- Are you mad?
Let them be, Georges.
Let them drown, if it's what they want.
What does he say?
Some customers!
Listen to this:
"Hurry up. Deck destroyed.
Need urgent help."
How he talks!
Some sink without saying a word.
Remember that three-master?
They can't all sink like heroes.
That's not all. Three other ships request assistance.
Typical! It never rains, but pours.
Can't help it.
Rockets! Must be them.
To top it off, she's adrift!
Send them a signal.
They may not see us.
Say:
"Heading for you.
Passing rope.
Get ready to catch it."
Nice prize to hook.
Isn't it, Captain?
Worth the hassle. A fine ship.
The Cyclone is on us.
They'll try to send us the towrope.
Take this to the captain.
No, don't.
I'll do it myself.
That'll be better.
The Cyclone is here.
We must send them the towrope.
Calm down. No need to hurry.
6 hours, we've been waiting.
They bid their time. We'll do the same. That'll teach them.
If we don't maneuver at once, we will suffer the consequences.
No need to hurry.
And to hell with their towrope.
Why didn't they hurry up?
6 hours, after all the messages we sent!
Now they're here, we must bow to them.
We've waited this long, we'll wait longer.
- Is that clear?
- I see, but...
The way we're drifting, we'll float away and crash on the rocks.
I want to save my skin.
All you care about is your skin!
Forget the cargo, let it buy your lives.
The cargo's mine, get it?
I paid for it!
Anybody wants to share the costs?
You? The man in a hurry?
It's my first and last voyage with you.
Blast your scams.
The towrope's here to hitch us up.
Stay there.
I'll handle the maneuver.
- Marc!
- You're not happy?
Think about your men!
I do!
A man's only 50 francs a day.
The insurance covers men and goods.
The boat sinks, I'll get the money, the widows will get a pension.
That's not enough.
You're too coward to be a real sailor!
What do you care what I am?
That never bothered you.
You're a bastard.
You've always been one.
For two years, I've had to put up with your face, your talk...
But I never thought you could be as low on your boat.
- Your men should drown you.
- Catherine,
I won't leave you.
I hate you.
One knows well the person one hates.
I heard your lies just now!
You will sacrifice your men for your money!
The truth is, you're really trying to get to me!
2 years of the same.
I was with you, you were glad to see me suffer.
Now you know as soon as we land,
I'll be gone.
Never mind the boat and the men, you hate to lose me.
Enough, Catherine!
I may die, but not by your side.
I'll take my chances.
Will they take the towrope or what?
Weird!
All that whining, now what?
What a wimp! Dear God!
A raft... Good lord!
Look at that raft!
They must be nuts!
A raft in this weather!
The searchlight!
We must make for them.
Go port, 15.
Look, Captain. They'll go under.
If they don't, they'll crash into us anyway.
A raft in the sea with the 2nd helmsmen and 2 sailors.
I wish them luck.
- Your wife's with them.
- What?
She jumped on the descending raft.
No stopping her!
The bitch!
- They're being fished up.
- The Cyclone!
Happily, I managed to keep contact.
All right. That bitch will pay me!
- What's wrong, Tanguy?
- A woman.
Half dead, half drowned...
All I know is it's a woman.
- And Poubennec: 2 crushed fingers.
- Shit!
I'll see him later, the sun's on us, we must act fast.
- Send the towrope.
- Yes, Captain.
- And the woman?
- What?
Put her in my cabin, she'll be warm.
To windward. Hard aport.
Take the towrope.
Stand by!
We've hitched up!
Ahead, as slowly as possible.
I'll see how the boys are at the galley.
Hello, lads. How is it going?
Let's see you.
A Breton's head, that's solid stuff.
Still, got a chip in my piggy bank.
You'll get that fixed in Brest.
You'll get a new nickel-plate zipper. Girls never resist that!
You, Poubennec?
Not too bad, Captain.
A bit worried, though. Two fingers!
Two fingers!
That can't affect a newlywed.
Could've been worse!
That idiot! Understands nothing and won't stop laughing.
This isn't a galley!
It's a children's hospital,
The Tower of Babel...
They've tied it too badly.
Shit! 50 grand down the drain.
Haul in the bits.
We'll send a new one.
Good end for the season!
That'll cost them about 8 grand.
Maybe. It's a good deal.
See, George, everything works out.
We simply get dragged now.
No need to hurry in life.
Poor Catherine, panicking over nothing.
She wanted to go and leave me.
Where is she now, I wonder?
At the other end of the line.
Matrimonial ties are hard to break.
This little adventure will come out expensive.
It's good for their company:
Shipwreckers United.
- Say, Georges?
- Captain?
The towrope tore this morning, very naturally.
Suppose it tore again once it's pulled in, would that surprise anyone?
- Not too injured?
- Grazed my arm.
- You cleaned the wound?
- We dressed it.
- Has she said anything?
- A little.
- Is she French?
- From Le Havre.
How did she end up here?
Listen, Bosco.
Hellegouarch and Poubennec need an ambulance.
- How are they?
- Poubennec's lost blood.
- Nice honeymoon.
- Tough luck!
Are there any injured?
- Others like you on your ship?
- I'm the only woman.
You often go rafting in this weather?
Couldn't care less.
I just take back all I catch.
Don't...
Rescuing is a wonderful job!
You call this rescuing?
I'm only catastrophe's pen-pusher.
Handle the papers.
I'll see Poubennec's wife.
I wanted to ask you...
Have you towed Mirva?
The Cyclone goes out, she never comes back alone.
- She's behind us.
- Too bad!
What? You're a funny one!
- You wouldn't understand.
- Maybe.
But do you realize what this cruise means to us?
It took my men 12 hours to hitch up your boat and fish up people like you.
If this were our daily routine, we'd change jobs.
I thought I'd escaped that boat, but she's here.
Listen, sweet pie,
I don't want to know your stories.
Everybody's got troubles.
We should leave them on land.
Like women!
They should stay on land.
That's what we call a frank man.
Yes, that's a man.
Good to get home. Right, Tanguy?
Especially when you're not empty-handed.
Starboard, fifteen...
Truth is, I'll be happy to see my lovely wife. I like her.
She's lovely indeed.
Tanguy, the towrope!
It'll break!
A brand new rope, in this weather... Unbelievable!
It is unbelievable.
Read this, Captain.
What a dirty trick!
"Can still steer ship. Will get in unaided.
Appreciate your trouble."
"Unaided"! The rats!
They cut the towrope to get in alone and not pay.
Gang of crooks!
- How is she?
- Fine.
Tell him she'll go back on the raft.
- What?
- I'm sending you back.
- I won't go.
- You will and so will your pals!
Send them, if you want to.
I'm not a crew member.
I'm in charge here, understand?
Kerlo, keep the blankets.
Hurry up!
Maritime life is swell!
You come in a raft, you go back in a raft.
I've never been so delighted to approach a ship in my life!
I was really afraid
I'd become a widower.
Now I understand the meaning of understanding.
You and I are united for life.
All life long, you and I...
- Captain.
- What?
Someone for you.
Capt. Laurent, the Cyclone.
I am very happy.
- I wanted to see you.
- You did!
That was so kind of you.
- Are you kidding?
- Not at all. I owe you a lot!
So you've found a way not to pay!
Come on, I don't understand...
Can you explain why and how the towrope broke?
Hard, isn't it?
Good weather, quiet sea...
And to top it off, a brand new rope!
Quite a mystery! A miracle!
Here's my version:
You backed up and broke it.
And you got in unaided.
There you go.
You must be joking! How can you imagine I'd do that to a sailor?
Please, spare me your bullshit!
Crooks are crooks even on a boat.
I understand your frustration.
But you shouldn't accuse me of that!
You have no evidence at all!
It's fine to defend the interests of your company.
But it makes plenty of money,
Capt. Laurent!
Losing some won't bust it.
Oh, yeah...
I'm sure we can come to an agreement.
I'm not an ungrateful chap.
I like to reward good will.
You've worked all night and saved my wife. That counts!
So you and I could maybe agree on something to reward your efforts.
How much?
Andre...
I haven't shaved.
I'm very prickly.
Doesn't matter.
I'm so happy you're back.
Look at you!
I wasn't in Greenland!
I swear I wasn't that far.
They made us move.
You wouldn't believe it.
Poubennec told me about your troubles.
Poor fellow lost 2 fingers.
How did his wife react?
First, Marie cried.
Then she was almost happy.
Happy? Why?
She thinks he'll give up sailing now.
What would he do instead? Knitting?
You women, you all want us sitting by the fire like pensioners.
- Don't get angry.
- Always the same old story.
You're hungry. I have cutlets.
Cutlets!
I could eat an entire lamb!
I'm so tired!
It gives me the creeps, I swear, when I think about Hellegouarch's busted head.
And the charcoal, the towropes...
The whole thing's a disaster!
Stop thinking about it. Let's eat.
Yes, I'll eat the cutlets.
I'm hungry as a wolf.
I'm so hungry, I'm yawning.
At least this is real coffee, it's not Royer's water.
You're a kind little wife.
You make me feel good.
- I wish you'd love me.
- Are you raving?
- Love me as before...
- What do you mean?
I understand, you've grown too used to me.
I'm always there, so are you.
The days go by...
Why aren't we as happy as we were in the first days?
Only women can come up with such questions!
I'm very happy with you.
Are you unhappy?
- Almost.
- Why?
If it goes on like this, I will be.
What's the matter?
My sad little life, that's the matter!
We could be so happy if you wanted to be.
Please, be reasonable.
I've enough worries as it is.
Oh forgive me...
Come on. Don't be silly.
Help me. I must write a report and send it to Paris.
What infuriates me is that the Company will be pleased.
I had a good reputation.
Now I've bungled a job, they'll make the most of it.
Sometimes I swear I feel like packing it all in and resigning.
We have enough to live on.
Do you really mean it?
I do. Why?
Not immediately, of course.
But later, and I mean it.
Later is always too late.
We could have a peaceful life.
If you felt bored, you could go back to sea.
But we'd have had a long holiday.
We'd go to Paris a while.
And you wanted a house here.
A fixed boat.
It'd be nice to have a house of our own, with a big bedroom, all white, overlooking the sea, as you like the sea.
That may be Marie.
Hello, Mr. Tanguy.
- Mrs. Laurent. Is it a bad time?
- No, come in.
Tanguy, just in time for coffee.
Actually, I'm a bit nervy today.
So no coffee...
What's the matter?
Captain, I'd rather not discuss it in the presence of your wife.
Besides, I have itchy feet, so maybe we could go for a walk.
I understand, let's go.
- Excuse me.
- Don't worry.
I swear it's a serious situation.
Don't make such a drama out of it.
These things happen.
- They only happen to me.
- No.
I won't make a drama but frankly, you're happy to get home...
That was me. Then silence.
No one. Not even a soul!
Except for the cat and the children.
A nightmare! She went out yesterday morning, slept out...
And nothing. Not even a message.
I don't understand.
Don't worry.
And to be honest with you,
I'm not really angry,
I'm worried.
- What do you mean?
- Worried.
Come on, do you think your wife could be lost?
You seem to like playing the fool.
- The fool?
- Exactly, pal.
She's been openly cheating on you.
You're the laughingstock for everyone.
I know that.
- So why don't you ditch her?
- Ditch her.
Ah, I've wanted to for a long time, but never dared.
But this is it. Given enough rope, you'll hang yourself.
Some people won't be happy.
Mr. Lemeur for one.
What? What is it?
I'm about to make you unhappy,
Mr. Lemeur.
The source of your good jokes will dry up.
And I say this in front of everyone:
The fool's dead.
Think of me as a widower or a bachelor from now on.
Hello.
Gabriel, I'm so happy.
I knew you'd be here.
I've been worried stiff, darling.
Renee, I've told you:
Given rope enough...
I'll hang myself. I know it.
Don't I get a kiss?
You're shy because they're here.
What do you care?
I was so worried in Conquet last night.
What did you go there for?
I was with Etiennette.
She was going to catch a boat to Ouessant, to meet Gaudin, the radioman.
He's been moved there.
Didn't you know it?
I didn't. So what?
The boat didn't leave because of the bad weather.
Such awful weather!
You know what I'm talking about.
So everyone stayed there.
Pierrot, Lou and Mrs. Frapier.
- You stayed with them all day?
- Yes.
- And all night?
- Yes.
- Why?
- What do you mean?
I was looking after Etiennette.
- Was she sick?
- Seasick.
- But the boat never left.
- Anxiety.
She's so nervous.
She didn't sleep a wink, neither did I.
A howling wind.
I said to Etiennette: "Gabriel must be in the eye of the storm."
Despite the appearances,
I think about you when you're at sea.
- Why aren't you listening?
- It's nothing.
Let's go away.
- Where to?
- What? Home, of course!
Oh yes, home...
You feel like laughing, but you dare not.
You should, there's reason to.
Right, Le Gall? He should laugh!
Capt. Laurent's here?
That's me, lad.
It's all right.
I'll be at the Hotel de la Mer.
I'm sorry to bother you, you must be busy.
I thought you were gone.
No, I was a bit ill.
Come sit down.
I hesitated to call you, but I'm alone here.
And I wanted to see you and thank you.
You shouldn't bother.
I wanted you to know...
I'll be honest with you.
I didn't save you, my second did.
So that's not why you sent for me,
I suppose.
Don't beat around the bush, tell me what you want.
Are you always so rude to women?
In my line, we're not used to dealing with women.
Wish I hadn't rescued your husband's ship.
Please, don't mention my husband.
- You're his wife.
- Not anymore. I've left him.
I last saw him the day you sent me back to him.
- You won't see him anymore?
- If I have my way.
Maybe it's better like this.
Anyway, the Company lost 3 grand.
Some men live on that.
They'll pay for the towrope.
Any idea who cut it?
I know who did it, but can't prove it.
Easy, the entire Mirva crew know it.
I'm not the only one who knows him.
Where on earth did you find that man?
In Le Havre. He bought goods there every 2 months, and took them to his region.
He offered to take me with him.
I said "yes."
How long ago?
Two years.
That's long when you hate someone.
What's the matter?
You're different from the woman
I saw in my cabin, soaking wet.
Shipwreck costumes don't suit me.
You're better now.
You do notice women.
Excuse me, I must go.
- Not a drink?
- No time.
- The boss is waiting for me.
- He can wait.
- He's like a clock.
- Just wind it back.
- I really must go.
- Do you regret coming?
I have no regrets.
Good-bye.
Where were you, Captain, when the second towrope broke?
Where was I?
In the food cupboard, cooling up.
Please, Captain.
I mean, what did you see exactly?
What you would have seen.
A towrope breaking.
And you can still assert that someone did that.
- I'm sure someone did.
- You are!
It's proof we need.
Investigate, you'll find proof.
We could investigate, we could file a lawsuit.
We could also lose it.
Our clients wouldn't like it, nor would the directors.
Those directors want to blame me?
Fine me?
- Give me a dunce hat?
- We know your worth.
So do I. Tell them they're annoying me.
And I'm being polite.
Actually, I have a present for them.
I quit.
You quit? You can't! Are you mad?
Mad enough to do this job.
I've been considering quitting.
I'd like to relax and take walks like everyone else.
With my wife.
And I guarantee she'll be happy.
Nothing we can do.
Without you, we'll sell the Cyclone.
- What?
- That's right, and we've had some very good bids.
- Who from?
- The Franco-Dutch company.
Great idea...
What about the crew?
I'm afraid we may be forced to lay them off.
Nice...
Business and feelings...
Business and feelings don't go hand in hand.
Yvonne, how can a sensible woman like you imagine such things?
Whatever you say, what I have is serious.
I've known it some time.
Like all patients, you don't know what you have and you imagine the worst.
As in a book.
What you really need now is rest, peace and quiet.
No excitement.
- I'll talk to Andre about it.
- Please, don't.
I trust you. Don't tell him.
I'll do it myself.
Okay, I won't tell him. Good-bye.
Don't worry. I'll come see you.
Maybe not here.
Andre saw a seaside house.
I'd love to have a house by the sea.
Doctor Ripault? This is Maulette.
I need to see you about a patient of mine.
I should say a friend.
Yes, I suspect it's serious.
Very serious.
Good, all right.
Thank you. Good-bye.
Don't you mind taking a walk with a silent man?
No.
When two people are quiet, they have a lot to say.
They try to guess each other's thoughts. It's very nice.
Are you doing that now?
I'm not thinking about anything.
I feel too good.
I'm very happy you've taken me out.
That's all.
You're not difficult.
Just a walk on the beach, and you're happy, like a child.
I wish I were still "like a child."
When I was little, things were so simple.
If I was happy, I'd laugh.
If I was sad, I'd cry.
- But now...
- Now what?
Now, it's not the same.
I'm happy and unhappy.
It's all become very blurry.
Look.
A starfish.
Must have fallen last night.
What's your name?
What's yours?
Mine? It's Andre.
My name's Catherine.
That's my given name.
Everyone called me that.
Father, mother, the whole family.
"Catherine, elbows off the table.
Catherine, say hello. Catherine..."
It tingled my ears.
It was funny. I kept thinking:
"That's not your name, they call you that."
So I found myself a name.
- A new one.
- For yourself?
Yes. I used to think:
"You'll say your name to the boy who loves you."
Did you find that boy?
No, I've met some men.
One who died and my husband.
So?
They did like everybody else.
They called me Catherine.
I'll get the keys to visit it.
Where's the house?
Up there, by itself.
Fancy visiting houses!
- Come with me?
- Yes.
- It's dark here.
- I'll open the shutters.
- It's so secluded.
- Yes.
Nice spacious room.
Reminds me of a film
I saw long ago.
A horror film, with ghosts.
Everybody laughed, but I was very scared.
Big armchairs like these ones.
They remind me of the film.
The girl sat in an armchair, screamed
- and disappeared.
- Nobody saw her?
- Who?
- The girl.
I don't know.
Maybe I'd disappear as well.
Now, no silly thoughts.
Women like me were made to disappear.
Why?
That's the way it is.
We come in a raft, we go in a raft.
Been married long?
I hate that sort of question.
Well done!
That's a good answer.
You're getting better.
- What are you looking at?
- The door.
There are only bad doors here.
The wind whistles in. Imagine!
- You think about everything.
- Have to.
Of course...
Where are you going?
I'm curious, you know.
Catherine...
- Why did you call me?
- I scared you?
No, it felt funny.
You sounded like my husband.
He called me, I ran to him.
It wasn't love. And he lied.
Still, I'd come and he'd caress me.
You miss that.
What a brute you are!
After all...
- Maybe all men are brutes.
- You're angry?
No.
Nice, a white bedroom overlooking the sea.
Shut up!
- Why?
- Because.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Can't you tell me what's on your mind?
It's easy though.
I say everything I think.
Everything!
I'm not asking anything.
Plus, I'm fed up. I really am.
What am I doing here with you?
It's mad!
Look at me.
Do I look like a womanizer?
No.
Bet it amuses you, a babbling man.
I realize I'm babbling.
Listen, you're wasting your time.
I'm not into games.
I'm a simple man.
Simple men don't hide their thoughts.
They're not ashamed of their desires.
You're just like the other men.
You have lots of scruples and you never stop thinking.
Your present thoughts will never be known.
Even if you wanted to speak, you couldn't.
You'd babble away, to hide everything.
Why are you saying this?
What do you want from me?
- Nothing.
- Say it!
You say everything you think, right?
So what do you want from me?
And you? What do you want?
You.
Stop talking. Kiss me.
Kiss me.
- Where's Captain?
- No clue. Why?
Not an SOS, but a sailboat in trouble. We need him.
Mr. Kerlo, what's wrong?
An SOS. Is Captain here?
- No.
- Where's he?
Driving by the sea.
- Around Creuzon.
- Thank you.
Been looking for you.
What's the matter?
- A sailboat in distress.
- Sent an SOS long ago?
The time it took me to find you.
I'll go.
Stop the winch! It's no use.
What are you doing?
It's pointless to go now, Captain.
The Dutch has already hitched up.
- How long ago?
- Long enough.
Is it you, Andre?
- Is it you, Andre?
- It's me.
Kerlo didn't find you?
Yes, he did.
Wasn't it anything serious?
A sailboat in distress.
The Dutch rescued it.
- The Dutch?
- Yes.
So, if you let them...
You've quit? You've done it?
No...
The administrator...
Have you spoken to him?
Yes, I have.
You didn't even ask for a holiday?
Can't leave the ship and the crew.
It's stronger than me.
Yes, stronger than you.
Actually stronger than me!
I can't endure this life anymore.
I'll get ill.
Who gets ill like that?
You promised me.
- I just can't.
- You don't understand?
What if I were really ill?
If I said "I need fresh air,
I'm suffocating, open the window"?
Would you stand there, stiff-lipped, and say "Impossible, must keep the window shut"?
What do you mean?
It can't be. You were smiling.
- You're mad!
- Daydreaming.
I was watching you.
You had a sparkle in your eyes.
What's going on?
- Don't be silly.
- Don't leave me alone.
You're here, but I'm alone.
You try to be caring, but you can't.
You're so cold.
- I have worries.
- Lucky you. Keeps you busy.
I have no worries. I'm bored.
I'm bored to death.
Andre, do you still love me?
You're complicated!
It's easy. Just say "yes" or "no."
You think I don't love you, as I love my job.
What's all that to me?
Your job, your ship, everything?
The world might as well be flooded over, for all I care.
Our life is in shambles.
- Don't say that. Shut up.
- I won't.
I've been quiet for years.
This is my SOS.
You're right. Stroke my hair.
I'm your wife, your property.
You like owning things, don't you?
Your crew, your ship, your wife...
These things are in your hands.
Any blemish, you open your hands.
You like what's strong like you, what's new.
The Albatross, your ship... when she was scrapped, you nearly broke down.
But when you saw the brand-new Cyclone, you were in bliss.
All over her, caressing her.
- Shut up!
- No, I won't.
I've been unhappy too long.
And I'm ill!
If you were, you wouldn't be talking like that.
Why didn't you say you were unhappy earlier?
I was happy before, Andre.
And I want that back.
But I know you, you only think of yourself.
I've only been waiting.
It suited you.
I can't take it anymore, I'm ill.
Stop it! I've had enough of that illness bullshit.
You're such a brute!
- I hate you. Go away.
- Say it once more...
Once, 10 times, 20 times...
Go away!
Andre, where are you going?
To my ship.
That's not normal.
He spends hours watching the floor or the ceiling.
Lights a cigar, doesn't smoke.
I ask him if he's hungry.
No answer.
Lemeur's right, he's weird.
He's not weird. He's bored!
Why?
Any of our business?
No, but we can't leave him like that.
Why are you laughing?
There's no answer to boredom.
You hear me? None whatsoever.
I've tried everything.
- What is it?
- Come on, Captain...
I'm not hungry, pal.
I want to be left alone!
You're worried, so I worry too.
Leave me alone, for God's sake!
Say, Tanguy.
You came to see me about your wife.
You were wrong. And so was I, to give you advice.
What goes on between two people, no one else can understand.
You were waiting for me?
Yes, I was.
- What took you so long?
- Lots of troubles.
You don't see it coming, then it hits you.
So I stayed in my cabin like a fool.
I've thought about you.
I've been thinking about you all the time.
Have you?
I like the storm. I could feel it coming, I felt stifled.
Now I can breathe.
I feel much better.
Hold me in your arms.
It's out. That's fine.
They say lightning can strip you naked without harming you.
You can do that as well.
I need you, Catherine.
Don't call me Catherine.
Tell me the name you wanted for yourself alone.
- Will you?
- Yes...
Aimee!
You find it silly.
I was little,
I wanted to be loved.
That's the best I could find: Aimee.
What is it?
It's a power cut.
Apparently, it may last a while.
There. Better than nothing, right?
I've changed so much since
I met you. I'm a new man.
All I used to like and live for is now meaningless.
Hard as I try,
I can't be reasonable.
In this weather,
I'd be at sea with my crew.
But I'm here, looking at you.
And I'm happy. I'm very happy.
All I care about now is not losing you.
The storm brought me, remember?
Now he's coming to get me.
I know what he's crying out:
"It's over. You've been happy too long. Now it's time to go."
Why are you saying this?
Because I can't live here without you.
You have a life I can't be part of.
I love you.
Because I'm here today.
I've spent two days thinking about you.
What can I say about my wife?
That was different. It was...
It's over now. She knows it.
She's told me so herself.
You believed her? You pretended to because it suited you.
No, for me it's much simpler.
I've never been into having affairs.
If it was an affair,
I wouldn't be here.
I'm here because I love you.
You see, we'll be together.
I don't want to let you go anymore.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
I beg your pardon?
Someone wants to speak to you.
To me?
- What's wrong?
- Mrs. Laurent.
I've come to tell you she's very ill.
She's ill?
She doesn't know I'm here.
The doctor's with her.
It's bad. She wants you.
Doctor? Is she in danger?
Here, Andre. Hurry up.
What?
Hurry up.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I don't know why...
I thought he'd be here.
Yes, he was here.
I'll have to pack in the dark.
Luckily I didn't unpack much.
Are you leaving?
There's a train at nine tonight.
Will you still sail a lot with Capt. Laurent?
I will.
What else am I supposed to do?
Plus, I like it with him.
I'll ask you a favor.
I'd be very happy to do something for you.
Will you be seeing him every day?
Yes.
So you'll see if he's sad... if he's sad or unhappy.
Unhappy people easily recognize one another.
It'd be sad if we didn't.
Give this to him. It's a starfish.
I got it from him.
He'll understand.
But if you see he's happy, throw it in the sea.
The starfish...
Marie, you must be tired.
I'm not, really.
What's wrong?
What's wrong with her?
She's been ill for a while, but wouldn't tell you.
- She got worse all of a sudden.
- Is she in danger?
She's weak.
We gave her two injections.
My darling...
You can't imagine how happy I am.
With you here, I'm better.
Forgive me. You were right.
I didn't realize how ill you were.
But now I'll give it all up and we'll go south.
It's warm and sunny down there, you'll get well quickly.
Forgive me for having left you.
It's normal to want to be alone.
And I'd been so silly.
Luckily, what we say when we're suffering doesn't count.
I wanted to tell you...
Get your head next to mine.
And don't say anything.
I'm ill, I have the right to speak.
And I have so much to tell you, which I hid for fear you'd laugh.
I love you so much, you can't imagine.
You know, I was jealous.
That made me suffer.
Stop talking.
When I saw other people and the way they love and live, I thought:
"You're lucky.
Andre is different.
He's never cheated on you."
I felt so happy, you can't imagine.
Yvonne, you know...
Don't be sad. I'm not sad now that you're here.
I'm looking at you.
I can see you.
- Tell me?
- Kiss me.
Tell me you love me, Andre.
Say you've always loved me.
- What's happening?
- We've just got a strange SOS.
Yvonne!
It can't be!
Yvonne!
It can't be! This isn't happening!
I can't believe this!
It can't be!
Captain, an SOS.
What do I care? An SOS...
It's the Dutch.
In distress, going onto the rocks.
They're calling us.
We can't let them down.
What do you want me to do?
The Dutch...
Faithful Servant. I render you to Him who formed you from clay.
Faithful Servant.
May the army of Martyrs lead you into triumph.
May the splendor of Saints be upon you.
May the Virgins greet you.
May the assembly of Patriarchs lift you into hope.
Faithful Soul.
Faithful Servant.
- Soul of Your Servant.
- Perils, grief and tribulation.
As Elijah perished and as all men shall.
Deliver her, Lord.
Deliver Your Servant.
As Noah from the deluge.
Deliver her, Lord.
Deliver, Lord...
The soul of Your Servant.
As Isaac from his father's hand.
As you delivered Moses from the pharaoh, king of Egypt.
As you delivered Daniel from the lions' den.
So that you may escape the Darkness and the moanings of flames and the pain of torment.
- Faithful Servant.
- Faithful Soul.

- This is a stickup. Hands on the table, everybody!
- [ People Scream ]
Come on, come on.
Snap it up!
Okay, Stokowski, dry up.
[Man ]
Come on. Get up against the wall there.
- All right, keep moving now.
- Over to the wall. Come on. You too, Grandpa.
- Don't move.
- [ Screams ]
- I tell you, don't move!
- [ People Scream ]
- Helen!

[ Narrator]
Victim: Helen Jannings.
Occupation: housewife.
Survivors: husband and two children.
The bullet that killed Helen Jannings... was sent to the F.B.I. headquarters in Washington... examined and catalogued in the National Ammunition File... where bullets from unsolved cases are kept for reference.
It was soon to have a companion.
Victim: Frank Malloy.
Occupation: bank guard.
Survivors: wife and three children.
Cause of death: shot while trying to prevent a bank robbery.
Two murders within five days in the same city.
Investigation was already underway when Ralph Demory... chairman of the Police Advisory Board, arrived.
He conferred with Chief of Police Bernard Harmatz...
Lieutenant Paul Staller of the Homicide Squad... and Richard Atkins of the F.B.I.
The bullet that killed Frank Malloy, the bank guard... was forwarded to the F.B.I. laboratory in Washington.
A routine check of the barrel markings under a comparison microscope... revealed it came from a Luger-- the same Luger that had killed Helen Jannings.
This bank robbery, a violation of a federal statute... gave the F.B.I. jurisdiction to come in on the case.
Mr. Hoover assigned it to Inspector George A. Briggs... one of the Bureau's top investigators.
Together with a squad of special agents trained in handling bank robberies...
Inspector Briggs proceeded to Center City, where he was met by Richard Atkins... special agent in charge of the F.B.I. field office there.
In a police lineup in Center City... a suspect named Robert Danker, picked up by the F.B.I.... was identified by several bank clerks as the killer of Frank Malloy... and by David Jannings as the murderer of his wife.
- What time did you leave the Meadowbrook?
- I was never in that clip joint.
- You're certain of that?
- Sure I'm certain.
That's your driver's license, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- That was found in the Meadowbrook... right after Helen Jannings was murdered.
- You were there, weren't you?
- No.
- Your license was.
- Ask the guy who swiped it how it got there.
- It's a frame.
- Who's framing you?
Stooling ain't in my line.
I'll take care of him myself.
- Oh, come on, Bob. We're just trying to help you.
- Yeah, trying to help.
You're trying to pin a double murder rap on me.
All right then, your license was stolen, somebody framed you.
But why shield him? Your best chance to clear yourself is to prove that you were framed.
- I'll prove it my own way, when I get out.
- That may not be so easy.
I'll take my chances.
They don't look too good right now, Bob.
You came into this town a month ago, a vagrant with a police record.
- You admit being here the day the bank was robbed.
- But I didn't heist no bank.
You claim you were never in the Meadowbrook, and yet your license was found there.
I told you--
Oh, you already got me strapped in the chair, so what's there to talk about?
Well, let's talk about the license.
If you didn't drop it, who did?
- I told you. I was in Chicago that night.
- Have you any proof of that?
Sure. I cut off my arm and buried it there for an alibi. All you gotta do is dig it up.
Talk like that isn't gonna help you, Danker.
- Wasn't there anybody who saw you?
- Look, it's a city.
Nobody sees you in a city, do they, mister?
- Your room clerk, landlady.
- I didn't have no room. I was busted all the time.
- Where'd you sleep that night?
- Under a new building going up.
- One near the freight yard.
- Where'd you get this, Bob?
That ain't blood.
That's red paint off a girder.
Red paint, in the cellar of that building where I holed up.
- All right, Bob.
- It's paint, I tell you.
We'll send you some other clothes.
In the meantime, get those off.
Have his clothes and his shoes sent in right away.
[Harmatz]
We'll book him on suspicion of robbery.
[Harmatz]
We'll book him on suspicion of robbery.
[ Narrator]
At the F.B.I. laboratory in Washington... a microscopic examination and chemical analysis... was made of the smudge on Danker's coat.
Exposed to the spectrograph, the smudge was broken down... into its component parts and photographed.
The densitometer concluded the examination... and the results were immediately forwarded to Inspector Briggs.
- Is the chief in?
- Yes, sir. He's expecting you.
Inspector Briggs is on his way in, sir.
Lieutenant Staller,
Inspector Briggs is here.
- Hello, Inspector.
- Hello, Paul.
- What's the score?
- Danker's innocent.
- No!
- Our laboratory definitely places him in Chicago... at the time the Jannings girl was murdered at the Meadowbrook.
- Well!
- That girder was painted at 5:30... on the afternoon of the murder.
It was quick-drying stuff, from six to eight hours.
The paint penetrated his coat just enough to show... that it was almost dry at the time that Danker rubbed against it.
- What do you know?
- Which puts him in Chicago between 1 :00 and 2:00 a.m.... around the time the Jannings girl was killed.
"His presence in Chicago conclusively established... by further laboratory examinations."
- Looks like the kid was framed.
- Seems to be very little doubt about it.
Now if we can get him to talk about that chauffeur's license.
Wish I could be in your session with Danker, but I've got to run along.
Thanks, Charlie.
Okay, I'll attend to that.
- Have Robert Danker sent in.
- Yes, sir.
- Looks like he's been released, sir.
- Released?
Before I came on duty.
Oh, here it is. Bail furnished by the Personal Bonding Company.
Just across the street.
- Hello.
- [Man ] Good morning.
- Hello, Dave.
- Good morning, Lieutenant. What can I do for you?
- This is Inspector Briggs of the F.B.I.
- Yes, sir. Sit down.
- You arranged bail for one Robert Danker?
- That's right.
- Do you mind telling us who put up the money?
- No, not at all.
Let's see.
Danker. Here we are.
Robert Danker, suspicion of robbery.
Bond $5,000.
Cash by John Smith.
Yeah. Mr. Smith again.
Do you know this Mr. Smith?
Never met him before in my life.
Wouldn't know him if I saw him again.
- Any address?
- I think you'll find it's a phony, like the name.
They all do it.
Hotel Conlin.
- Never heard of it.
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks anyway.
- Anytime.
Danker was framed.
We investigate and prove his alibi... but before anybody knows that except us, he's bailed out.
That can only mean one thing. Somebody wants to see him as badly as we do.
[ Sirens Wailing ]
[Narrator]
That night at 20 minutes past 11:00... a body with numerous knife wounds... was found on the main highway leading to Center City.
It was identified as Robert Danker.
- Hello, Inspector.
- Hello, Hank.
Nice to see you again.
Did you get my man?
Have a good man for you to look over.
Just the qualifications you need.
[Man ] Defending against the knife attack is a very dangerous proposition... and should be avoided if possible.
That's Cordell with the instructor.
Been in the field two years.
He's back for in-service training.
You're closing in on a hijacker when he suddenly--
- [ All Laughing ]
- I'm sorry, Mr. Haynes.
Not at all.
Cordell, this is a test of your reactions.
Here are photographs of four armed killers. Study them carefully.
Look upon them as living people, armed and dangerous.
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, Woody. Are there any questions?
- No, sir.
Go to the starting point and load without further command.
Are you ready, shooter?
- Yes, sir.
- Start walking.
That's good. Always take cover when you're outnumbered.
Reload and holster.
Start walking.
- Well, why didn't you shoot?
- Because he wants to surrender.
- We wouldn't shoot a man in cold blood.
- Re-holster. Still walking.
- Why did you shoot the man on the left first?
- Already had his gun drawn.
Re-holster and start walking.
- Why didn't you shoot?
- He's using an innocent person as a shield.
Re-holster. Resume walking.
Cordell's fine.
He's a good choice, Hank.
- Send him over to my office first thing in the morning.
- Certainly, Mr. Briggs.
- Send him over to my office first thing in the morning.
- Certainly, Mr. Briggs.
- Now then, the bank robbery and both the murders--
- [Door Opens ]
Mr. Gordon.
- Hello, Cy.
- Mr. Briggs.
- I don't think you know Gene Cordell.
- No, I don't believe I do.
- How are you, Gene?
- It's good to see you again.
Do I know him?
I brought him into the Bureau.
Taught him to shoot at the right target.
Kept him from being a wealthy lawyer.
I was just telling Gene.
Cy already knows the case.
The same gang that pulled the bank robbery... also pulled the Meadowbrook job.
That's when they framed Danker.
Now, we know that Danker's hangout was right in this section, skid row.
Here, we have it over here.
Here's Dock Street.
Here's where he lived, at the Royal.
These are the various poolrooms and dives that he was known to hang out in.
There's the Dock Street Gym.
We know gangsterism is returning.
Since the war, at least a half a dozen gangs... have sprung up in that area alone.
The juvenile delinquents of yesterday-- all of them more clever, more ruthless than the old-time mobs.
And as I say, we're convinced that one of those new gangs... is responsible for the murders of Malloy... the Jannings girl and Danker.
Solve any one of those three murders, we'll have the gang we're after.
Gene, you're going to follow in Danker's steps.
Cy, as I explained, you're to surveil him every minute.
Gene's only communication, unless otherwise directed, is going to be through you.
- I understand.
- Cy will be living right across the street... at the Gilbert.
This Danker was a tough kid that knew his way around. You're to be his carbon copy.
- Right, sir.
- Now, this is our plan.
Suppose you were to drift into Center City.

- Only trying to help your boy.
- He could use a little sharpening up.

- Now, wait a minute!

Maybe you could show the kid a couple of things.

- I wouldn't worry about that.
- You any good?
- Good enough.
- Who'd you ever fight?
- I been hit by the best.
[ Chuckles ] You think you could maybe, uh, last a round?
I'll take a little bet on it.

- Wait a minute.
Hey, Punchy, come here.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
Here. Spread this.
Take 20-to-1 Giveno.

Don't lose your head.
You're swinging too wild.
Come on, Dynamite!
[Bell Rings ]
Come on.
Settle down, will you?
What's the matter with you?
Why don't you get that left hand working?
- You're letting that guy make you look like an amateur.
- Hey.
Ten bucks.
Yeah, you're dynamite, okay.
Now, look.
Get him in the nose. In the nose!
It breaks easy. Scatter it all over his kisser.
You're the favorite now.
How about me putting some dough on Giveno and you take a dive, huh?

I'll send you a wire.

Easier ways to pick up a quick buck.

- I think I got a lead.
- Yeah.
At the gym.
Somebody went through my wallet.
Stole my Social Security card.
- What's your name, fellow?
- What's it to you?
- Come on. Let's have it.
- Manly.
- George Manly?
- Yeah.
- You're under arrest.
- What for?
- Suspicion of robbery.
- What? Are you kidding? I ain't robbed nothing.
Next time you break into a jewelry store, don't leave your Social Security card.
[Narrator] Cordell's Social Security card, planted in a robbed jewelry store... coupled with his arrest, was the first indication... that the Bureau's plan was meeting with success.
For if the plan were working, as apparently it was... then Cordell indeed was walking in Danker's shoes.
Here. Relax.
- Relax!
- Okay.
[ Narrator]
On January 4, a routine request... one of approximately 26,000 received daily by the F.B.I.... came into the identification division from the police department of Center City.
It asked for the complete record of George Manly.
A search of the name index failed to reveal any record on George Manly.
His classification was then obtained... and checked through 1 07 million fingerprints on file.
Of those cards having the same general classification... the sorting machine rejected all but one possibility.
This was then traced to the criminal fingerprint files... which identified George Manly as being Eugene Cordell... a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It was brought to the immediate attention of the assistant director... in charge of the identification division.
He and Inspector Briggs had anticipated this request... for the criminal record of George Manly as a result of Agent Cordell's arrest.
To prevent Cordell's exposure, a false record had been prepared.
This was now forwarded through routine channels... to the police department of Center City.
The following day in Center City... a bail bond was put up for the release of George Manly by a Mr. John Smith.
Once more the pattern was repeating itself.
What had happened to Danker was happening to Agent Cordell step-by-step.
Your boy just checked out. Yeah.
Hello, Dynamite.
I haven't seen you around here lately.
Back now.

- Is that right?
- Weekend in the country.
- Courtesy of the city, huh?
- Something like that.
Georgie.
We, uh--
- We oughta get to know each other better.
- Anything in mind?
- Got anything on for tonight?
- Not yet.
You're invited.

- I'll call that 10 and bump you 10.
- Who's winning?
- Well, I'm not.
- Here.
- Thanks.
- Three ladies, huh?
- Aw, shut up!
- And I was gonna shoot the works with three jacks.
- You see?
Drop dead.
Here you are, honey.
- How about giving me a little kiss, huh?
- Do you mind?
- You're breathing down my neck.
- My affectionate husband.
- Who opened that window?
- Well, not me.
- Think I'd open a window with you in the room?
- You fresh-air nut.
You open that window again,
I'll throw you out of it.
Come here.
- [Doorbell Buzzes ]
- Well, answer it!
Well, what do you think
I was gonna do?
- [Door Opens ]
- Oh, hiya, Matty.
-Judy, I want you to get acquainted with Miss LeVal.
- Oh.
- Hiya, fellas.
- [ Chattering, Wolf Whistles ]
I want you all to be introduced to Miss Valentine LeVal, the actress.
[LeVal] Hi, fellas.
Looks like you're having a good game.
Come over here and meet Alec.
Alec, this is Valentine LeVal, in person.
- Delighted, I'm sure.
- How you like, boss? Some class.
- Where'd she get that coat?
- A present from her Uncle Matty.
Come out here,
Uncle Matty.
[Men Chattering At Table ]
Does that dame know where the coat came from?
Of course not, boss.
You know I don't tell dames nothing.
Just like you say, never trust a dame.
And dopes.
You know that coat's hot.
Do you wanna lead the cops right to us?
- I told you never to buy anything from a fence.
- But she--
Now, take off!
And ditch that coat... before she tells the cops where she got it, Uncle Matty.
[Doorbell Buzzing]
- I'll take it.
- Make up your mind.
- Hello, Georgie.
- Hi.
Boss.
Come on in here where it's private.
- Hiya, champ, Shivvy. I want you to meet--
- Did you say something?
- No, boss, I didn't say nothing.
- Blow.
What's griping him?
Sit down.
[ Sighs ]
Well, Georgie... what's your racket?
What's yours?
Sweet job you pulled in Pittsburgh.
Smart. No conviction.
- Never been in Pittsburgh.
- No?
How about San Diego, April '46?
Suspicion of armed robbery.
- No conviction.
- You got me crossed.
How about Philly, last December?
Grand larceny.
No conviction.
Miami, Richmond, Trenton.
No convictions.
- What you selling?
- Here.
Take a look at this.
Direct from the F.B.I.
Or, uh, should I say indirect?
Through my pipeline... in the police department.
Sorry about the weekend
I gave you, Georgie.
But you see...
I'm building an organization along scientific lines.
I need men who know their way around... who can get by.
That's why I screened you.
- Screened?
- Sure, like in the army.
Only I pick my own recruits.
You see, it works like this.
I spot a guy who looks good.
So what do I do?
I get him framed.
The cops check his record through the F.B.I. Then I get it.
It's my idea.
It takes connections... but I've got them.
Should be back in the police files, huh?
It'll get back... same way it got out.
- Convinced?
- Not bad.
Coming in, Georgie?
What about my hearing?
Supposed to show up in court Friday.
It'll be fixed. Forget it.
And there's one thing you'd better get straight.
There's just one idea man in this outfit-- me.
I do the thinking.
I give the orders.
That's okay by me, boss.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, I'm gonna like you, Georgie.
You catch on fast. Here.
Buy yourself a closet full of clothes.
I like my boys to look sharp.
Come on in the other room.
It's chilly in here.
[Plates Clattering]
- What'll it be?
- Coffee and--
- Out of doughnuts.
- Okay, give me some pie.
- Out of pie. Toast.
- You won't get an argument out of me, honey. Toast.
- Hamburger.
- With?
- Everything.
- [Boat Whistle Blowing]
Say, miss, when's the next ferry?
Every hour on the half hour.
Say, ain't that Georgie?
Yeah.
Wait here.
[Alarm Buzzing]
[Boat Whistle Blows ]
Hey, do you want to break your neck?
Sorry.
[Whistle Blowing]
[ Whistle Blowing]
- Hello, Gene.
- It's good to see you again, Mr. Briggs.
I flew in from Washington tonight.
[Narrator]
Cordell's report convinced Inspector Briggs... that the Stiles gang was the one they were after.
Now it was imperative to secure concrete evidence to obtain a conviction... and to ferret out who in the police department... was making the Bureau's records available to the gang.
Upon concluding his report,
Special Agent Cordell returned to Center City.
[ Tires Screeching ]
Out kind of late, ain't you?
- What's the idea?
- Where you been, Georgie?
I took a ferry across the river.
- What for?
- What's it to ya?
- What business you got across the river?
- I said, what's it to ya?
You don't take no ferryboat rides in the middle of the night for your health.
- What did you pull?
- You got a long nose. Why don't you keep it to yourself?
From now on you ain't got no business that ain't Alec's.
What do you think this is, a penny stick-up outfit?
You mean I gotta share my special numbers with you mugs?
What's the matter with the dames on this side of the river?
You got a red queen on a red king.
- Everybody got it?
- [ All Murmur Agreement ]
That's okay. Now play it back just like it's going to be.
At 25 after 10:00,
I drive up with you to the gate.
You're in the back seat all dressed up in a monkey suit.
Get on with it.
The guard takes us for one of the invited characters, so he lets us in.
And once through the gate, I get out of the car and-- boing-- rock him to sleep.
- Okay, come on, come on!
- I pull in car two and keep the motor running.
Same here, in car number three.
As you pull in, I'm cuttin' the wires to the switch box. Then I start whistlin'.
- [ Whistles ]
- When Whitey whistles... me and Mutt get out of the car, go in the kitchen.
- I stand by and keep the motor running.
- 10:30, Monk...
Georgie, me and you, we're goin' in through the front.
We head for the banquet room.
I make 'em line up, face the right and left walls.
- I cover 'em.
- Are you with us, or some dame?
- Shut up.
- I'm right with you, boss.
Keep that head of yours where it belongs, or some cop'll blow it off, pretty boy.
- [Matty] You ain't kiddin'.
- [Stiles ] Nobody asked you.
All right.
We head for the banquet room.
- I make 'em line up, face the right and left walls.
- I cover 'em.
I take 'em on the left wall, work 'em over for whatever they got.
-Ditto for them on the right wall.
-All right. Now for the getaway.
- Shivvy and me, we carry the junk out.
- [Stiles ] I cover you.
- [ Cordell] Right.
- I head north on Highway 7.
- And we meet back here. Any questions?
- [ Group ] Nah.
Okay. Whitey, Nick, Mutt, swipe three cars and bring 'em around back of the gym.
- Uh-huh.
- We take off at 10:00 sharp.
- Right, boss.
- Pick me out a limousine, will ya?
- Where we gonna eat?
- I don't know. Try that new place.
- Yeah. That's close by.
- [ Indistinct Chattering ]
- Nice going, General.
- What's the use of having a war if you don't learn from it?
- Hiya, fellows.
- [ Men ] Hello,Judy.
- You're not leaving already?
- Okay. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on.
- Thanks, boss.
- I'll be right down.
Why didn't you let 'em stick around here and clean up this mess?
Looks like they've been raised in a trough.
Well, if the maid were here, she'd really blow her top.
Oh, the Willard mansion, huh? You know,
I read they got gold faucets in every bathroom.
Gee, they must creep with money.
I heard Mrs. Willard had a--
- Didn't I tell you never to poke your nose in my--
- Cut it out!
Who do you think you're shovin' around?
One of your dumb lugs? I don't take it!
- Don't you touch me!
- You open your trap, and I'll--
- I will! You ever touch me again, I swear I will!
- Shut up!
I hope they get ya tonight.
Yeah, I hope they do for me!

I got away as soon as I could, Chief.
- I'm glad you let me in on it.
- You wanted me to keep you posted.
We're all set.
Pick yourself a boom-boom.
- A honey of a Luger.
- [Shivvy] Layoff. That's the boss's.
You got another one?
Thanks.
Looks like we'll make it okay,
Inspector, with time to spare.
Take the bridge route. We'll go byway of Agnes Avenue. We'll go in Demory's car.

Okay.

This is Briggs calling W.F.B.I.
Come in, W.F.B.I.
This is W.F.B.I. Mr. Briggs, stand by for a direct message from Blanket.
- Go ahead, Blanket.
- This is Blanket.
Received urgent message from Gene.
"Family will not appear.
"Plans canceled.
Family warned you were waiting for them."
Thanks. Stand by.
- They're not gonna show.
- How come?
I'm sorry, Chief.
It looks like they decided not to show up.
- Why, it's only quarter after now.
- No. I got a message.
- They won't be here.
- What do you suppose happened?
I wish I knew.

- You tipped them!
Oh, my God!

You tipped 'em!
You tipped 'em! You tipped 'em!
I didn't!

- Straight bourbon.
- Same.
- Bourbon. Got that?
- Did you ditch the cars?
What do you think?
- Any idea why the boss blew the deal?
- No. What's your guess?
- I pass.
- I think that--
- You pass too.
- How 'bout a little game of poker?
- Good idea.
- Count me in.
- See you, guys.
- What's the rush, Georgie?
- I got a date.
- Same here.

Now, what is it that couldn't wait until tomorrow morning?
- That tip-off. Where'd it come from?
- The F.B.I.
Luckily for you,
I was around.
Take my advice, Stiles:
Lay low for a while.
They've got nothing on me.
But maybe
I've got something on them.
- What do you mean?
- This gun.
Somebody just broke into my arsenal and shot it off.
- What for?
- What do you think?
Bright boys... trying to match it up with a couple of souvenirs...
I left in the Meadowbrook and the bank job.
Bright boys... thinking only they can play at being cops.
You get the fingerprints off this gun.
The way I figure it, maybe the same rat who tipped them shot it off.
Mm. Any ideas?
Yeah. Eight.
It's got to be somebody in my outfit.
- Nobody else knew where that arsenal was hidden.
- You'd better get it out quick.
I'm way ahead of ya.
- When do I get the dope on this?
- It may take a little time.
- I'll call you.
- All right.
Call me at my house.
And hurry it up.
- And don't let that gun out of your sight.
-Just a minute, Stiles.
[ Door Unlatching ]
All right.
- Yes.
- The bullet Cordell sent in.
Hello, Fred.
Get me Gordon, will you?
Yeah. It looks all right.
- Get it off to Washington on the first plane.
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead, Mr. Briggs.
- What's the latest on Gene?
He went to usual place at 1 0:00.
Still there.
Everything quiet.
Okay.
You punch-drunk pug, how many times have I told ya to keep that door shut?
It's freezing in here!
I was gonna do it, Mr. Stiles.
I was gonna do it.

Hi, Bill.
Hello, boss.
Say, boss, what happened last night?
Little change of plans.
I sure could've used that basket of lettuce.
That blonde of mine--
- I'm sick of you and your dames.
- Hey, boss. Phone for ya.
What do you open with?
- Yeah?
- Do you know a fighter by the name of George Manly?
- Yeah.
- You shouldn't.
- I'll see that he gets your message.
- [Man ] You in or out?
- What about that package?
- I'm with you.
- Okay. Meet me at 4:00, same place.
- Too rich for me.
- Ah, you win the deal.
- I win somethin'.
Manly. Tonight.
Keep him on tap.
Check.
[Knocking]
Hello, Mr. Demory.
Stiles.
There you are.
You'll get a bonus for this, Mr. Demory.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna vote you a great big bonus.
Where's it coming from? With a stoolie in your outfit, they've got you stopped dead.
All we've got to do is chop this stoolie, and we're in business again.
You don't know when to stop, do you, Stiles?
Slot machines. Gambling rackets.
That wasn't enough.
No. You have to take on a bank.
I didn't see you turn down your cut of the bonds and stuff.
Killing a guard, then following it up with a couple more murders... making things tougher all around.
Go ahead. Kill Manly.
Give the F.B.I. an engraved invitation... to put you in the chair.
- Dead men make bad witnesses.
- Hmm.
And who said I was gonna kill him?
[ Chuckles ]
That's where you come in,
Mr. Demory.
- You're out of your mind.
- You know what?
You're gonna be a big hero tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
Your name'll be all over the front page.
"Demory gets armed robber."
"Mayor's little man wins big police medal."
- If you think you can mix me up in it--
- Relax, Mr. Demory.
Your hands'll be clean.
The cops'll do the killing.
Let me know when you start talking sense.
I'm talking it now.
- Now, listen, Stiles.
- I kicked in plenty when I didn't need you.
Always around for the payoff, weren't you?
Well,you're sticking around for this payoff. Sit down.
Well,you're sticking around for this payoff. Sit down.
Go on. Sit.
We got a big job to do tonight.
Now, here's where you come in.
- Hello, Chief.
- You just caught me, Inspector. Hello, Dick.
- Chief.
- What's on your mind?
- A little package of dynamite.
- Well, explode it.
I'd like to read you a report from one of our agents.
"At 12:19, Alec Stiles left the rear entrance of the Dock Street Gym.
"He entered car and proceeded to Milford and Oak Streets.
"He parked car and walked to 1680 Oak Street.
"He was admitted by person unknown at 12:30 a.m.
He left at 12:50 a.m."
- Do you happen to know who lives at 1680 Oak Street?
- No.
- Ralph Demory.
- What?
Were you with Demory all the time last night after he arrived here?
-Just before he went on the raid?
- Yes. Yes, I'm sure I was.
No. Wait. Now I remember.
He went to his office for a few minutes.
"At 9:55 last night, Stiles received a phone call."
- Subsequently, the Willard job was called off.
- Well?
All the facts seem to add up.
Demory's financial status. His bank deposits.
His bond purchases.
Roughly 20 times in excess of his salary.
- I just can't believe that
Demory is mixed up in this mess.
- All right.
Perhaps this will convince you.
Our Washington identification division shows requests... from your police department for the records of all these men.
All of them members of the Stiles gang.
Now, these records, supplied by us, were then made available to Stiles.
And he used them to check on prospective gang members.
Is Bryant still there?
Have him come in.
Try and run a police department with stuff like this going on.
- Yes, sir?
- Hello, Sam.
This is Inspector Briggs of the F.B.I.
Sergeant Bryant.
- How do you do, sir?
- Sergeant.
- You know Atkins.
- I sure do. Hello, Dick.
- Sam.
Ever had a request from anyone here for the records of these men?
I get so many requests, sir.
Let me see.
- Yes. Here's one I checked on today.
- George Manly.
- Today?
- Yes, sir.
- I lifted one of his latent fingerprints off a gun.
- Was that gun a Luger?
- That's right.
- Who asked you to check it?
- Mr. Demory.
- Mr. Demory?
- Yes, sir.
- Were Manly's the only fingerprints you lifted?
No. There were also a couple of fragmentary prints.
- I identified them as Alec Stiles's.
- Thanks, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- [Briggs ] Oh, Sergeant?
- Have you got the serial number of that Luger?
- Yes, sir.
Thanks.
[ Dialing ]
Line, please.
[ Dialing ]
This is Mr. Briggs.
Get me the radio room.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Radio room.
- [ Briggs ] Get me Gordon.
- Yes, sir.
W.F.B.I. calling number six.
W.F.B.I. calling number six.
- Number six.
- Stand by, number six.
- Go ahead, Mr. Briggs.
- Briggs speaking.
Tell Cordell to get out immediately.
The gang has made him.
He's in great danger.
Cordell's one of our agents.
He's been doing undercover work... in the Stiles gang under the name of George Manly.
I see. That certainly ties Demory in, all right.
- What do you want me to do?
- For the moment, nothing.
We'd better get back to the office.
We're expecting word from Washington.
They may give us the green light to move in on the Stiles gang.
- Why don't you come with us?
- I want to.
- Good.
- And if you don't mind, I'd like to take Lieutenant Staller too.
- We'll pick him up on the way out.
- Right.
[Telephone Ringing]
[ Ringing Continues ]
Yeah, yeah?
- Let me talk to George Manly, please.
- Who?
- Oh. Hiya, boys. Come on in.
- Hiya, champ.
- What's the pitch?
- Boss wants to see ya.
Got a little job on for tonight.
- Great.
- [Knocking]
- Yeah?
- [ Clerk] You're wanted on the phone.
Tell 'em I'm all tied up.
- Dames.
- Somethin' classy?
He says he's tied up.
- What's the deal?
- You know the boss.
[ Car Honks ]
[ Cars Honking ]
- Follow that gray car. Quick. F.B.I.
- Yes, sir.
[ Horn Honking ]
Are we gonna get a briefing, pick up the guns?
Nope. This is a fast one. Boss'll give us the lowdown when we get there.
It came up sudden-like.
Take it easy, champ. Relax.
Boss knows what he's doin'.
Mr. Demory.
- Is Chief Harmatz in?
- No, sir.
- Get the night detail together.
I just got a tip about a robbery.
- Yes, sir.
"Re: Test bullet from Luger 7.65 millimeter.
"Barrel markings identical with murder bullets removed...
"from victims Frank Malloy and Helen Jannings.
Arrest Stiles gang and Demory immediately. Hoover."
- Dick, get three squads ready.
- Right.

Take her around the side.
Straight ahead, Georgie.
- Where's the nearest telephone?
- I don't know, but there's a gas station up the road.
- Maybe they got one.
- Okay. Get there as quick as you can... and call the F.B.I. and ask for Inspector Briggs.
- Inspector Briggs.
- Yeah. Tell 'im that Gordon followed Cordell...
- and two of the gang to the
Anderson Manufacturing Company.
- Cordell?
Gordon followed Cordell and two of the gang to the Anderson Manufacturing Company.
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. What's your number?
- A-371.
- All right. I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir.
Now, step on it.
The watchman.
I wasn't tryin' to steal nothin', honest.
I was just tryin' to find a place to park the bones for the night.
Well, park 'em someplace else.
Go on. Beat it.
- [Whistle Blowing]
- Thanks.
- Wait a minute.
Get 'em up.
Get 'em up!
- Hello, Georgie.
- Hello, boss.
- What's up?
- Sweet job.
F.B.I., I wanna speak to Inspector Briggs.
- I have a message from Gordon.
- Yes?
Yes? What's the message? Just a minute.
[ Mouths Words ]
"Anderson Manufacturing Company.
Fraser Road at Caron."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Message from Gordon.
He's tailed Cordell... and two of the gang to the Anderson Manufacturing Company.
- That's out on Fraser Road.
- At Caron.
Dick, our group will take the Anderson plant.
- Morry, your squad'll handle the gym.
- Okay.
- Parker, you pick up Demory.
- Yes, sir.
If you don't mind, Staller and I would like to go along with Parker.
- Try and keep us away.
- All right. Let's go.
- Good enough.
- [ All Chattering ]
- Pulled this one out of the air, Georgie.
- Yeah?
Yeah. Left, 1 8.
Easiest way to crack a safe:
Use the combination.
No noise.
[Crash ]
[Running Footsteps ]
- What was it?
- Watchman. Guard.
- [Knife Snaps Back]
- [Stiles ] Okay.
Go ahead. Take it. It's all yours.
No cuts for anybody.
Go ahead.
And this is one job that'll never get tipped off, will it, Georgie?
I don't get you, boss.
You don't, huh?
Why, haven't you heard?
Somebody did a little singing... to the F.B.I.... told 'em things like where I kept my gun... when we were gonna pull the Willard job.
Now, who would know all that but somebody in our outfit, huh?
Yeah, Georgie, we picked up a pigeon.
Now,you're a smart guy. Suppose you were me. Suppose you were running this outfit.
How would you get rid of him?
You don't know, huh?
Oh, there are lots of ways, sure.
You could knock him off with a gun.
Shivvy could knife him. One of the boys could drop him in the river.
But that wouldn't be clever, would it? No.
The F.B.I.'d be crawling all over you. They'd keep getting in your way until they got you.
Right, Georgie?
No. There's only one scientific way to get rid of this stoolie.
Let the cops bump him off.
Smart, huh?
You see, Georgie, any minute now... a squad of cops'll be coming up the front way.
And guess whose shadow they're gonna see on that window.
And guess who they're gonna pump full of slugs... thinking they're knocking off a safe cracker.
And who do you suppose is bringing the cops?
My number-one connection in the police department. And, Georgie... he's leaving that way clear for us.
- [ Stiles Grunts ]
- [ Yelps ]
- Not in the face. Don't mark him up.
- [Blows Landing]
- [Vehicles Approaching]
- Here they are.
[ Officer]
Looks like your tip was okay, Mr. Demory.
- Put him back.
- But the cops--
Put him back, I said.
Ooh!
[ Gunfire Continues ]
- F.B.I. What's up, Sergeant?
- Robbery. Cashier's office on the second floor.
[ Gunshot]
[ Briggs ]
Take care of Gordon.
- Is he the only one who was in here?
- Yes, sir.
[ Gunshot]
[Approaching Footsteps ]
- Gene!
- This way!
[ Panting ]
Let him have it.
You all right, Gene?
- Okay. How is Gordon?
- Bad wound, but he'll be okay.
Well, Inspector,
I didn't expect to find the F.B.I. here.
- We got a tip on a robbery.
- We got a tip too.
- Oh, is that so?
- Yes. From one of our agents here.
Mr. Demory, I'd like to have you meet George Manly.
How's it, Cy?
Are you all right, Cy?
Me? Old rhinoceros hide.
Fill up the canteens, Kid.
And don't forget that big water bag.
All right, Bob.
-Is that the place?
-That's it.
-Where's the bank? At this end of town?
-Me? I don't know.
The last time I was there, there was nothing... no bank, no railroad.
There was a little cantina... and the most beautiful girl named Josefina, that played the guitar.
We're robbing a bank, not looking up old friends.
Yes, I know.
But I sure wish we were rustling cows.
-You want to change your mind, too, Kid?
-Not me.
Well, you better think it over.
I hate to take you along.
This is no cinch, like rustling a few cows.
I thought it over, Bob, and I ain't backing down.
No, sir, I ain't backing down.
Look, Kid, the border's over yonder, just 60 miles.
Why don't you light out?
We'll join you. Promise you.
I ain't backing down.
Then remember... all you do is hold the horses. No shooting.
Well, at least the cows, they don't shoot back.
Mount up.
That's right friendly of them.
I know why I didn't recognize him.
She has changed his name.
She used to call him ''Tarantula.''
You know, a big bug with legs.
''Welcome'' is more neighborly, right, Kid?
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, I'm Sweet. Looking for me?
No, neighbor. Just admiring your shingle.
That's a mighty pretty name, B. Sweet.
You fellas come in with that cattle outfit?
No, just riding through. Little business.
Cattle?
Talked about it some.
What happened, man?
Nothing, sir.
Perley, come get your breakfast.
Perley Sweet?
Now, that is a right pretty name!
She just calls me that.
Most everybody calls me Buck.
Buck Sweet.
I didn't know you had company.
Just passing the time of day with these here cowpokes.
Ma, why don't you fetch us some coffee out here?
I'd be mighty proud to.
You not only got a pretty name,
Mr. Sweet.
-You got a mighty pretty wife.
-Thank you.
She's a little sprung now, but I'll tell you... that little woman used to be the best dancer in this whole territory.
I’ll bet you were mighty spry yourself, Perley.
I could kick a little.
Why don't you fellas light?
No, we better be moving on.
If you're looking for work... you'll find most of the cattlemen down by the bank.
-Where is that?
-Right down the street a piece.
Now, you boys have some hot coffee.
I know you've been riding a long ways.
And I can tell you're from Texas by your hats.
Yes, ma'am. We're from Texas, all right.
Besides, you're carrying slickers.
Don't rain much in these parts.
Did you come in by the Old Mormon Trail?
-Yes, ma'am, we did.
-Didn't use much water. Got a full bag.
Did you happen to meet up with my niece and her husband?
They're coming out by the way of New Jerusalem.
No, ma'am, we didn't.
I don't see how they could have missed them.
They're coming out by wagon, and expecting them for Christmas.
Perley went up in the mountains and cut a big piney tree this morning.
Do you think that he could have missed the turnoff at Terrapin Tanks?
Be just like him to.
Never knew such a shiftless fella.
Tried everything but preaching.
It don't take much brains to drive a wagon from New Jerusalem to Welcome.
-If he did, he'd never get here.
-Another cup?
No, thanks.
Say, I bet you put eggshells in to settle the grounds, like Ma used to do.
-'Course I do. Where you from, son?
-From Abilene.
And what's your name?
My name's William, but everybody calls me ''The Abilene Kid.''
I bet they called you ''carrot-tops'' when you went to school.
-''Brick-top,'' ma'am.
-They did? Me, too.
Thanks for stopping by, boys.
-Coffee was real nice.
-Mighty nice, ma'am.
Thank you very much, ma 'am.
I’m sure proud to have made your acquaintance, ma'am.
Thank you, son.
Well, Perley, thanks.
Hope you have a nice crop of apples this fall....
I’ll be seeing you boys, probably.
I do declare, but you're a sight for sore eyes!
You kind of got the advantage of me, ma'am.
I mean all of you. I’m so sick of the East.
For the past two years,
I've been back east in Denver, Colorado... hobbled up in a boarding school... till I just love the sight of anything sitting a horse.
-And that Charro saddle!
-See, Bob?
And what is your lovely name, seòorita?
My name? Lordy, my father's president of the bank. Tolliver Latham.
-I expect you do business with him.
-We aim to, ma'am.
Ruby, my girl!
Welcome. Welcome to Welcome!
Welcome home, Miss Ruby.
Remember, Kid, you don't do no shooting.
I thought so.
Real desperado type.
Pete, quick, get on your horse!
-Sorry, Miss Crumly.
-Tell me what's the matter.
Little bank robbery. Come on, get going!
Come on, Kid! Step up!
Haul it, Pete!
Get those bandits!
Don't let them get away!
Blast one at 'em, Pete. Hang on, Kid.
Again, Pete.
Pull up, men.
-Gosh, Marshal, you missed them.
-They ain't paying me to kill folks.
Them Texas boys gonna be mighty thirsty before they get to water.
-Back to the depot, Curly.
-The depot?
Yeah, the depot. The railroad depot.
Giddup.
You hurt bad, Kid?
-No, but I bled like a stuck pig.
-Don't try to talk, Kid.
That Perley character....
You know, he busted that on purpose.
Take a mouthful, Kid.
That's enough.
All right, men, raise your right hand.
As duly appointed Marshal of the territory of Arizona...
I hereby deputize you for the sum of $3 a day to find--
-Hey, watch them pack mules, will you?
-I’m doing the best I can.
Come on along, girl.
You unload them pack horses.
Get them on there.
Come on, Curly, I’m late!
-Come on, Curly, get them mules.
-Now, where was l?
Say, Buck, I thought we were gonna get $5 a day.
I don't spend tax money that easy.
$3 a day and found.
Now, you solemnly swear to uphold and enforce the law. Say, ''I do.''
-I do.
-Good.
Can I drag it now, Buck?
I’m eight hours late now.
Don't bust your bellyband, Luke.
We'll be aboard.
-Marshal.
-Yes, Mr. Latham?
Shouldn't you deputize more men?
The bank can't risk letting these desperadoes escape.
Sets a bad example.
I don't want you to fret none, Mr. Latham, but if it's gonna worry you....
Boys, Mr. Latham here just put up a reward.
$100, dead or alive, for every one of them poor fellas.
-Thank you, Mr. Latham !
-You got them for $100.
Thank you, Luke.
Good luck, Marshal!
Give the Kid a swig of water, Pete.
Drink it up, Kid.
Plenty more when we get to
Mojave Tanks. Drink it up!
There she is, fellas.
There she is, Mojave Tanks!
Water, Kid.
Water.
A thousand gallons of it.
You're gonna feel a whole lot better, a whole lot cooler... once we wash up that shoulder.
Go ahead, Kid.
Boy! I’m gonna skin me down to the hide... climb up that ladder, and dive in that tank, right to the bottom.
Never come up!
Gosh! That a man should have such a great big thirst like I have... and only water to quench it with.
Anyway, cheers, friends.
Get down.
Ain't no sign of anything.
But that's no guarantee they ain't around.
You boys keep your eyes open.
-Sure, Buck.
-You mind what I told you, now.
At night, two men stay awake while one sleeps. They won't rush two of you.
-I’d like to see them try it.
-Just don't get careless.
Ben, I’ll take that deck of cards in your pocket.
I ain't paying you pitch players to sit in the shade all day and claim low.
-Shall I drag her, Buck?
-Drag it, Luke.
Drag her, Jake!
Sons of bitches! Let's rush them.
Six-shooters against Winchesters?
I’ve seen enough.
That Perley character.... Tin star.
A lot smarter than I thought.
Well, let's take a look at it.
Up here's where we come from. Welcome.
Railroad winds around and makes a bend here at Mojave Tanks, where we are now.
Then it moseys off again to the southeast.
Down here's the Mexican border.
-50 miles, I figure.
How's 60, then?
So that Perley character starts playing checkers with us.
He figures we'll head this way, and right.
It's the first water.
So he jumps us and stakes out his deputies. No water.
So he figures our next move will be up to Apache Wells.
Right.
So he jumps on his freight car and heads that way.
And he'll be there, setting waiting.
He can keep squatting on his hunkers from now till Christmas...
'cause we ain't gonna be there.
We're doubling back on our tracks to Terrapin Tanks.
-But that's up to the north.
-We'll get our water.
We'll hole up in the piney woods until the Kid feels better.
Then while that marshal's sitting, getting calluses on his rump... we'll set out to the east... jump the tracks there, and be over the border.
Yes, that's good.
But where are we gonna get some water?
It looks like you and me are gonna chew a lot of barrelhead cactus... if we can find any.
Kid gets the canteen.
All right, Kid. Come on.
Get in the saddle.
-What are you doing?
-I’m tired of riding.
Besides, it cost me nothing.
It come with the horse.
Wind's getting hot.
Sí, what they call in my country a ''Santa Ana''... from the clouds of dust... that follow the cavalry of the illustrious General Santa Ana.
Let's make for that draw!
Kid, are you all right?
My shoulder. It kind of throbs.
-Could I have a little water, Bob? Please?
-Sure, Kid.
Take it slow.
That's enough.
Where did you picket the horses?
I tied the horses right there to the bushes.
But devils must have come in the middle of the night and let them loose.
My God!
But what have I done to deserve this?
I was always a good person.
That's what happens to me
after my decision to come here...
to this land, with these two fools.
-Shut up!
-What did I do to end up with these idiots?
Looks like we've got to walk a piece.
Well, what are we waiting for?
-Perley Sweet, what are you doing here?
-Hello, Miss Florie.
You seen three men come through here begging for water?
If I’d seen anything like pants around here... they wouldn't have had to beg for anything.
Come on, Curly, get that stock off of there, will you?
-We ain't got all day.
-I’m doing the best I can, Marshal!
-Come on, Curly, move!
-Hurry it up, will you?
Wait a minute!
What are you getting excited about?
I’m not excited. Come on, boys.
Fixing to stay here for a while?
Lordy! If this ain't a Christmas present for me.
A whole passel of men!
-Come on.
-That's right.
-How's Cousin Carrie Lou doing?
-Right pert, Florie. Come on, Curly!
Well, her loss is my gain.
There ain't been a soul around here to listen to me...
-since my old cat got tired and left.
-I’ll bet it was a tomcat.
Can I drag it now, Buck?
-I’m 16 hours and 29 minutes late.
-Drag it, Luke.
-Get that on there, boys.
-Drag it, Jake.
There she is, men. Water!
Lots of water.
What is it?
You hear anything?
Cover me, Pete.
There's a fine old state of affairs at the tanks.
-They ain't dry, are they?
-Worse than that.
It’s a tenderfoot wagon.
A man and his woman.
They come from New Jerusalem.
They made the tanks, all right, but the water was a little low.
Mr. Tenderfoot ain't got sense enough to dig out the sand... sit back and wait for that sump hole to fill up.
No, sir. Besides, he don't take kindly to using a shovel.
He puts in a stick of dynamite to start the water running.
-The fool!
-So he stuck in his dynamite.
Only fool's luck he didn't blow himself up doing it.
-I wish he did.
-But he didn't.
He just put Terrapin Tanks out of business forever.
He cracked the granite floor of that sump hole... and busted down her sides.
The tanks are dry.
And they'll stay dry.
They can have cloudbursts in this country from now till I get religion... them tanks will never hold another drop of water.
Fool tenderfoot's dead, I guess.
But he's gonna keep right on killing people, just the same.
Men will come here, banking on water.
Five or six years, there'll be a dozen skeletons... around them busted tanks.
But that ain't biting me half as hard as what he went and done next.
He let his stock nose around and lick up that alkali slop below the tanks.
It drove 'em plain loco.
They took off up the canyon, hunting water, with him right after them.
That's four days ago. He ain't back yet.
So we don't need to waste no time speculating on his case... or feeling sorry for him.
That wouldn't have been so bad... but he left his woman alone in that wagon.
Yeah, she's there right now.
She had a little water, so it wasn't so bad till yesterday.
Then it gives out.
Been pretty hard on her, in there all alone.
She's a nice little woman, too.
28 or 30, I’d guess.
Too blasted good for the cuss she married.
But still, that ain't the worst of it.
No, sir.
Not by a long shot.
She's gonna have a baby, and she's gonna have it now.
I’m a tough bird, an awful tough old bird... but I’m not going back in there!
Pete, you gotta go.
You gotta do something for her.
You ought to know something about these cases. You do, don't you?
Wasn't you married to a woman down on the Río Bravo?
Didn't she have kids for you?
Sure, Bob. Sure, she did.
But, you know....
An Indian woman is different.
God, our lord... tells them what to do with babies, how to born them.
But, a gringa....
Poor girl.
Yeah, my sister, she had all the neighbors, the doctor, nice white sheets, and--
Pete, I’m not passing the buck.
I’m just ruminating for information.
Pete, please....
Who are you?
Seòora... please do not be afraid of me.
I have come to help you.
Ain't no use there, Kid.
Only water we're gonna get is right over here.
Barrelhead.
It ain't the best water, and it will take time.
But I guess we got plenty of time now.
-Yeah, Pete?
-Bob, I’m going to need the water now.
-Give it to him, Kid.
-How is she?
I don't know. It is her first baby.
Come on, let's get back to squeezing barrelhead.
She wants to see you... all of us, together.
Did she have....
A boy.
I can't see you.
-You're the one that found me.
-Yes, ma'am.
-What's your name?
-Robert, ma'am.
Robert Hightower.
William Kearney, ma'am.
I’m proud to make your acquaintance, ma'am.
And you're Pete. Bless you.
Sí, seòora.
Pedro Encarnación Arango
y Roca Fuerte...
at your service, ma 'am.
Will you save my baby?
Yes, ma'am. I’ll save him.
And I will help.
Me, too, ma'am.
Poor little son.
You'll be all alone in the world when Mother leaves you... won't you, sweetheart?
And you'll miss me so.
Nobody to tuck you into bed at night.
Nobody to teach you your prayers.
Nobody to kiss the little sore spots... when you fall and hurt yourself.
Nobody to tell your little secrets to.
I want you, all of you... to be my baby's godfathers.
You will be, won't you, Bob Hightower?
You will, Bill Kearney? Pedro? Promise me.
I will, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
It will be a big honor, seòora.
And his name.
I call him Robert...
William Pedro...
Hightower.
And when he's a fine, big, brave man... like his godfathers... you tell him about his mother... who so wanted to live... for him.
Lift him up, please.
Let me kiss my baby.
It’s getting dark.
We must be moving on...
Robert William....
All right, Kid, go ahead.
Is that all, Kid?
Them's all the words I know, Bob.
Then, amen.
Yes, sir.
The more I think of that big fella in the Texas hat... the more I admire him.
Hurry up there, Curly!
We're hurrying, Buck.
I get him behind bars eating some of Ma's cooking...
I’m gonna play him a game of chess.
He'd be right good at it, too, I’ll bet.
Pay attention here, you fellas.
Come on, pay attention.
Stock's ready.
Now, it stands to reason that he'd head south for Mojave Tanks.
We should have reached there before he did, two horses packing three men.
And I don't take him for any tomfool to go rushing three men that's got Winchesters.
So I figured that his next move... would be to push right on through here to Apache Wells, where we are now.
I hate to admit it, but he's outguessed me.
They might have give out in that sandstorm--
Not that breed of cat.
They could have made for Dobie, down this way.
No, that's too far.
So's Dos Hermanas, down here.
They must have gone somewhere, Buck.
Yeah, and mighty cute, too.
He's doubled back on his tracks... and holed up right here at Terrapin Tanks.
That's where we're going.
We ain't gonna waste no time.
Let's go collect him.
All right, Buck.
You fellas keep your eyes open for strangers. Remember that reward.
-Okay, Buck.
-All right, Buck.
Tell Cousin Carrie Lou
I’ll be dropping in around New Year's... maybe with a new husband.
Gosh, Buck, we want to go with you!
You'd be a whole lot safer.
First thing, seems to me, we ought to give
Robert William Pedro a bath.
A bath?
I wasn't figuring on that at all.
I was thinking about feeding him.
I’m for tubbing him, all right.
Of course, sooner or later, we've gotta swab him down.
But he's such a little fellow, Bob.
-He won't use much water.
-He'll fit nice into this dishpan.
I was just wishing he could stagger along for a few days without bathing.
I don't know much about infants... but little Robert boy here looks clean enough for me.
Didn't you ask his mother nothing?
Do you think I was gonna drive the lady crazy... with a bunch of silly questions?
In my opinion, gentlemen, taking a bath is the least of little Robert's troubles.
He's just naturally gotta eat and wear something better than this towel.
It'll plumb scratch the hide off of him.
When a mother's gonna have a baby, she fixes up things for him.
Sews clothes real nice... and knits pretty little kickshaws and what all.
Maybe there's something for our godson in that tail box.
She had a heart, this mother.
She made really nice things for her baby.
Don't leave me out here all alone!
How long you gonna be?
They don't expect him to walk in them things.
And he ain't gonna wear that.
Now, this is something.
This is really something.
Canned milk.
That thick stuff ain't fit to squirt in coffee.
She wasn't figuring to feed him coffee, was she?
This is for Pedrito when he fixes himself up... and he touches his guitar under the balcony of a seòorita.
Bob, this is it.
Dr. Meechum on Caring for the Baby.
See what the doctor allows about bathing a newborn.
Here is a Biblia.
A Bible book.
''Bathing the baby.
''Too much care cannot be exercised...
''in performing this most important part of the baby's....''
There's a word here
I don't like to say in front of a little baby.
Spell it.
T-O-I-L-E-T-T-E.
Toi-letty?
What in the blazes is a toi-letty?
It’s a.... Don't you know?
I guess Robert boy ain't got no toi-letty in his war bag.
No, seòores.
Toi-letta, she is not an evil word.
A toi-letta is a little green tin bathtub... about the size of my arm.
Costs dos pesos.
When we get to town... we round up the best dad-blamed green toi-letty money can buy.
Remember that, Pete. Crack along, Kid.
What's the doc got to say next?
''The first bath should not be administered...
''until the baby is at least a week old.''
If I had a sick polecat,
I wouldn't send for that Doc Meechum.
A week without a bath.
That's all right for a grown boy... that ain't supposed to bathe between water holes... or in town on Saturday night, sparking his gal.
But a baby!
I’ll lay my silver spurs the doc's wrong.
Come again, Kid.
''Immediately after birth, the nurse...
''should rub the baby's body with olive oil.
''Or if olive oil is not available...
''with some clean, pure lard or grease.''
Grease!
-That?
-Sure, grease. Wait a minute.
Grease.
-Who's gonna grease him?
-You. You are boss wrangler.
It don't sound regular, Bob, I’ll admit, but it's right here in the book.
I ain't convinced nohow.
This godson of ours is starting life slippery enough without greasing him.
-But you got to follow the book, Bob.
-Sure!
Maybe it will prevent Pedrito from chafing and from getting saddle blisters.
Me and you have always been....
Wouldn't you like--
No, it's all right.
Cut out the Mex lingo around the kid, will you, Pete?
First thing you know, he'll be talking it.
We got to raise him with good old American habla, like his ma.
Hand over the pot.
We'll slick him up a mite.
Easy, easy.
-Pull his legs over a little bit.
-Get your finger out!
All right.
Bob, you ain't throwing a half hitch on a pack mule.
There. That will do it.
That kid's dideed, all right, and dideed to stay.
Cut out that Mexican.
Ain't you feeling good, Kid?
My shoulder kind of throbs.
We'll spare you a couple of swigs of water in a little bit.
You'll feel a lot better.
You better see what the doc is dealing next.
Food. Eat.
No, I got it, Pete. I got it right here.
''Feeding the baby.
''The best and surest method...
''is the one which nature has provided.''
Say that again.
''The one which nature has provided.''
-Well, that's out.
-Here, this is comforting.
This is downright comforting.
The doc allows that there's times when a newborn infant... won't thrive on nothing but condensed milk.
-We got some right here.
-Six cans.
Looks like you're going to get some chow, Robert boy.
All right, Robert William Pedro, but you're going to get fed.
You better get a can of that condensed milk and some matches--
-Bob!
-Yeah, Kid.
Let me hold him.
Gosh, Kid, you think you ought to, with that arm and all?
Let me hold my godson.
Just for a little while.
Thanks, Bob, for taking me along and all.
That is pretty, what the Kid is singing.
It’s what the folks back home would call a lullaby.
-Pete, what--
-It’s all right!
Okay, Pedrito. It's time to eat.
Go ahead. Come on, man.
Take it. It's good for you. Come on.
Boy, he hops to it like a drunkard at a Fourth of July barbecue.
A couple hours, and we'll have to set them up again for little Robert boy.
I’m for moving on now, Bob. Honest, I’m--
Just lie back and take it easy while you can.
That's the last of the gringo-head cactus.
She is finished.
I’ve been figuring. There ain't more than three shots apiece in these six cans.
That's 18 shots. We've used two already.
Leaves 16.
That little Pedro has enough for four days.
That's right. The Doc says little William is to get a slug every six hours.
Which doesn't leave much water for us godfathers.
There's always enough for you, Kid.
Here, have one on the house.
I’ve done a heap of ornery things... but I ain't stealing the water that belongs to my godson.
Too bad the doc didn't tell us where to get water in the Arizona desert.
Wrong book for that. Just a minute.
Maybe Nuestro Seòor has put here what to do in the Bible book.
Don't! It’s bad luck!
I can see it all mapped out: where to find our next water, where to head.
Maybe it says we should head back for Mojave and that reception committee.
Or over to Apache Wells, where old Perley is sitting.
Don't be too sure
Buck Sweet is twiddling his thumbs.
I think we ought to get out of here quick, now!
Where? Where, you jughead?
North to Cairo? Northeast to Damascus?
Or east to New Jerusalem?
60 miles or more with the Kid in the shape he's in?
And this punk?
Don't give me any more of your Bible talk.
I’d have outfoxed that marshal if they hadn't saddled this kid on us.
Why didn't somebody stop me before I promised that woman?
I don't want to grow no long white beard in the Yuma penitentiary.
May my beard grow clear till it gets down to my foots... may it get a nest of prison rats... before I break my promise to a dying woman!
-Who said I was breaking my promise?
-Why don't you kill the little fellow?
-Feed him to the coyotes!
-Why, you chili-dipping horse thief!
-Horse thief?
-Yes, horse thief!
Stop talking Spanish in front of the kid!
Now you see what you did?
You make cries the baby!
You waked the baby! Don't blame me!
Sure, nothing!
It says right here where we're to go, just like it's told everything about all this.
You fellas don't understand.
You think this is all just chance?
Just accidental, like us coming here this way?
Finding the mother, helping her....
The infant in the manger.
The star so bright last night.
I ain't talking out of no fever sweat,
Bob, honest I ain't.
You think we had anything to do with what's happened?
No, sir, we didn't.
No more than you had anything to do with throwing the book... so it would open in the place where I’ve been reading.
Where it tells where we're going to next.
-Listen, I’ll read it.
-No, Kid.
Go ahead, Kid, if it makes you feel any better.
''And when the days...
''of her purification were accomplished...
''according to the law of Moses...
''they lifted up the child and brought him to Jerusalem...
''to present him to the Lord.''
It says Jerusalem right here in the book.
New Jerusalem.
Look, Bob, maybe Nuestro Seòor... he no care very much what happens to a simple cattle thief.
But if I was in a gambling house,
I would play the Kid's number.
You would?
All right, let's get cracking along.
Kid, me and Pete will spell each other carrying the infant.
I’m toting my godson my share of the way.
That's part of it.
That's in the book, too.
There was three wise men come from the East, wasn't there?
Three wise men. I’m one of them.
I’m betting on you, Kid.
All right, Pete, which way's Jerusalem?
Why, that way, Bob.
Can't you see the star?
Look, water.
-That ain't water, Kid.
-Salt.
It’s a salt lake. We got to cross it.
-No.
-Just a little bit, Kid.
Don't be a fool, Kid. Drink it.
-You got to.
-No!
He shouldn't have made me swallow that, Bob.
-That's all right.
-You shouldn't have done it, Pete.
Once we're across the flats, we're through the worst of it.
Here.
-What are you doing?
-It will be easier crossing the sand.
There's plenty of rough country over there, Kid.
I ain't figuring on going that far.
No, sir.
I ain't figuring on that at all.
Take your horses down to the tanks, boys.
Fill up your kegs first.
-Sure need it, Marshal.
-They'll drink her dry, Buck.
Curly, take a look in that wagon.
Gosh, Buck, there's been a woman here.
Left her dresses all this and that way.
What are they like?
One's real nice, sort of faded, but soft, like silk.
-Is it red?
-Yeah, it's red with a....
Has the top got all little white ribbons all around the rim?
It sure has, Buck.
That was her wedding dress.
Fourth of July.
Red and white, carrying a little blue fan.
Come on, Curly.
Those fellas have done watered up... and then dynamited our tanks, left us dry.
Lot of boys stick up stagecoaches, and banks, and one thing or another.
But a man that would dynamite a water hole in this kind of country... is downright criminal.
-How about giving the stock--
-Can't.
-Can't we just wet our whistle?
-Can't.
You heard Mr. Latham when he said $100, dead or alive.
I’ll add $50 to it. I’d like 'em dead.
It’s time. Water.
If I whimper for water, Pete... don't give it to me. Promise.
-Promise.
-It’s a promise, Kid.
137th psalm.
One-three-seven. Read, please.
''By the rivers of Babylon...
''there we sat down...
''yea, and we wept...
''when we remembered Zion.''
''We hanged our harps upon the willows.''
''If I forget thee, O Jerusalem...
''let my right hand forget her cunning.
''How shall we sing the Lord's song...
''in a strange land?''
''Our Father, who art in heaven....''
''Our Father....''
''Now I lay me down to sleep.
''I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
''If I should die...
''before I wake...
''pray the Lord...
''my soul to take.''
God bless Mom and Pop... and sister.
Make me a good boy.
Amen.
When do we set up the drinks again... for Robert William?
I think about 50 minutes.
They're slipping it easy to the Kid up there.
Poor boy.
Made him a little boy again.
It’s broke.
Your leg?
-She's busted. I’m ashamed.
-Maybe I can fix it.
-Waste time.
-I can make a travois Comanche-style...
-and drag you.
-Waste time.
On the other side of the mountain,
New Jerusalem.
You will make it.
When does little Pedro eat next?
Not for more than two hours.
Adiós.
Guess I better get moving along.
Maybe you better leave me your pistol.
The coyotes, you know?
Yeah, sure, Pete.
Coyotes.
I’m sorry I called you a chili-dipping horse thief back there.
It’s all right.
I just remembered what tomorrow is.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Pete.
Our Father...
who art in heaven...
make some space...
in your Holy Land...
for this poor Pedro.
Mount up. Let's get going.
''...unto Jerusalem....''
''...a donkey tied, and a colt with her:
''loose them, and bring them unto me.''
A donkey and his colt.
You just try stealing a man's burro in this country!
They'd string you.
That's it, Kid.
Sing it.
Sing a lullaby.
This is where she ends, godson.
This is the end of the trail, little Robert.
So, you break your promise
to a dying woman?
I can't go any further.
Of course you can, Bob.
What does the book say?
-Follow the book.
-Get up on your knees, you sack of dung!
You can't....
You got no right to call me that.
I’m going.
But you quit talking Mex in front of the infant.
You quit it, you hear?
-You're doing fine, Bob. Just fine.
-Sure I am.
Just think of the cantina
in New Jerusalem.
Yeah, I’m thinking of it.
A glass of beer.
-A big cool, cool glass of beer.
-Yeah.
Five glasses of cool beer.
You'll make it.
Sure I will.
Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas to all.
Set 'em up, bartender.
Milk for the infant... and a cool, cool beer for me.
A baby!
Turn around, Texas.
Turn around and draw.
Perley, you old hay shaker.
You got me.
Looks like the baby's pappy... is a mighty sick man.
Texas, you're about half-smart.
Jury still out, Curly?
Yep, still out.
The boss says, ''Come and get it.''
I’ll thank you to remember there's only one boss around here.
Yes, sir, and she says, ''Chow's down.''
-Morning, Carrie Lou.
-Morning, Bob. Sit right here.
Thank you.
Folks at the courthouse said you looked mighty handsome in those new jeans.
Thanks, Carrie Lou.
And especially in those boots with the Lone Star stitched on them.
Yeah, they're real comfortable.
Hope the batter on this chicken is to your liking.
-Looks good.
-A little syrup for them corn oysters?
Corn oysters? I didn't get no corn oysters.
I only had but two ears of sweet corn.
All right, seeing what he did for little Buck.
Little Robert.
I told you he wouldn't stand for a name like that for a little Perley.
His name is Robert William Pedro Hightower.
Yes, of course it is, until the court changes it.
Ma !
Bob, have some coffee, will you?
You ain't eaten much lately.
-You off your feed or something?
-I’m worrying.
Don't worry about it.
Maybe the judge won't give you the full 20 years.
It ain't that.
I could do 20 years standing on my head.
I’m worrying since I hefted little Robert this morning. He's losing weight.
It’s only natural for new babies to lose a little weight, Bob.
He didn't lose any when I was nursing him.
No. We're giving that little dear just every care we can.
If he were our very own we couldn't love him more.
Ma, don't carry on, now.
One thing you can count on,
Bob Hightower... you couldn't find better hands to leave the little mite in... than Perley's and mine.
-That's right, Bob.
-Sure.
Maybe. You two being his uncle and aunt... sort of distant relations, you might say.
See, Ma, I knew he would.
I knew I had you pegged right.
Look, you just sign this paper right there on the ''X,'' see?
Wait up, now. Wait up. What is all this?
The adoption papers, of course.
I ain't anxious to turn my godson to pasture.
You just said right there that we were distant relations.
I never.
-The jury's coming in, Buck.
-How they look?
They look like a passel of pallbearers.
Your Honor, we find the prisoner guilty according to law... but under exterminating circumstances.
Before passing sentence upon you,
Robert Marmaduke Hightower--
Now, have you anything you wish to say?
No, sir. I guess I ain't.
You ain't?
It seems, in this case... we have a mighty fine set of extenuating circumstances... notably dealing with an infant child you claim to be your godson.
He is my godson.
And now we come to the question of the infant's custodianship.
Who gets him, etc.
-Your Honor, if the court pleases--
-Yes, I know.
I got your application right here.
Prisoner, have you any objection to the Marshal and Mrs. Sweet... taking this here child?
If you mean permanent,
I got plenty of objections... but if it's temporary, that's different... providing, of course, they guarantee to give him a good education and such.
And just what specific do you mean as ''and such,'' etc.?
Teach him good horse sense, respect... say, ''Yes, sir'' when he's spoke to, and....
That seems reasonable.
Do you agree, Buck?
Sure, Wiley.
But what Ma and me wanted was to have little Buck permanent.
Sure you would, but you ain't going to get... little Robert William Pedro permanent, Perley.
Now, that's as it may be, etc. and so forth....
Robert Marmaduke Hightower... it is within the power of this here court... to sentence you to a term of 20 years in the penitentiary.
However, this here court... may be willing to suspend that sentence indefinite... providing you sign this here paper... yielding your godson to the Marshal and Mrs. Sweet... and furthermore providing that you never again set foot... in the township of Welcome, territory of Arizona.
You can throw the book at me, Judge.
I ain't gonna do her.
I ain't breaking my promise to a dying woman.
That's just what I been waiting for to hear you say, son.
I hereby give you the minimum sentence under the law: one year and one day.
Court's closed, bar's open.
Double bourbon, bartender, if you please.
Bye, friend.
I’ll be awfully good to little....
Robert William Pedro.
-Goodbye, Bob.
-I know you will, Carrie Lou.
Goodbye and good luck, boy.
A year in jail will do you real good.
Thank you, ma'am.
Bye, Bob. Good luck.
-Goodbye, Perley, you old hay shaker.
-Goodbye, Bob.
Say, kind of look after my deputy, will you?
See he gets started home from Yuma all right.
You know, he's never been away from Welcome before.
Sure, I’ll take care of him.
Put him on the train myself.
-Mr. Hightower.
-Miss Latham.
I want to thank you for that Lady Baltimore cake.
-I’m mighty glad you liked it.
-It would have been a lot lighter... without that hacksaw you baked in it.
Proud to haul you, son.
Can I write to you, Mr. Hightower?
Can I call you Bob?
I’d be proud for you to take your pen in hand, Miss Latham.

'September 9th, 1904,
'on board the Discovery, homeward bound from the Antarctic.
'I've added a little, I hope, to the knowledge gleaned
'by Captain Cook, Sir James Ross and other explorers before me.
'But I have only touched the fringe of things.
'I leave behind a whole continent,
'vast, mysterious, inhospitable,
'and still, to all intents and purposes, unknown.'
- Well, good night, Scott.
- Good night, sir.
I'm sorry, but that's how the land lies.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good luck to you.
- Sit up a little, Con.
- Hm?
- Sit up.
- Hm, sorry.
Something's gone wrong, hasn't it?
You can't go ahead.
Oh, we can go ahead, all right.
The Treasury won't let us have the money, that's all.
- Is that very bad?
- Yes.
It means I get the men but not the backing.
- I should have to make a public appeal.
- Well, why don't you?
You see, if I do go ahead with this show,
I might lose my chance in the Navy.
That would mean looking for some other job, and that would mean discomfort and unpleasantness for you.
As far as I'm concerned,
I'd take it on any day.
As far as we're concerned, Con, any day.
You knew the Antarctic long before you knew me.
I always knew you'd go back.
And I'm not the least jealous.
As a matter of fact, I don't think
I'd love you so much if you didn't.
Don't move, Con.
Do you remember walking along the sands just after the tide had gone out?
I asked you what exploration really meant to you.
The sands were still wet, and you said, "The fascination of making the first footmarks."
I'm a very, very lucky man.
Now, what shall it be?
"I appeal with confidence" or "I confidently appeal"?
"It is with confidence that we appeal..."
Lunch!
Lunch is ready, dear.
Just in time, Oriana.
- What is it?
- A flea, a rare one.
Just hold him while I get some spirit to preserve him.
No ordinary flea, Oriana.
I'll send him to Rothschild for his collection.
You might as well send him my soufflé too.
- Is that done now?
- Yes, quite done.
Never mind.
Oh, how's the drawing going?
Natterer's Bat. Lovely name.
Oh, isn't it heavenly here?
All on our own.
- Except for dead bats.
- And very dead grouse.
I wish they wouldn't keep sending them to you on your holiday.
I'll go and see.
Natterer's Bat.
Did you hear me, Mrs Wilson?
I suppose you couldn't help it.
I came here by motor car.
I've left it exhausted alongside the gate.
- How far have you come?
- The last lap was nearly a mile.
- Bill about?
- Yes. Do you want him?
Er, yes, I do rather.
- Well, he's working, you know.
- Yes, I know.
- He's...
- Working.
Come along.
- That noise was Captain Scott.
- Hello, Con.
- Hello, Bill.
- Haven't seen you lately.
You forget, Captain Scott's been on his honeymoon.
Well, as a matter of fact,
I've been rather busy, but we hope to have a honeymoon someday, somewhere.
Well, Con?
What's up?
Shackleton hasn't done it, Bill.
He nearly did but not quite.
I'm going back.
Shall we go in?
- Mind if I kick it up a bit?
- No, carry on. They're your boots.
How far did Shackleton get?
He got to within 90 miles of the Pole.
- Isn't 90 miles near enough?
- No.
Because it isn't it.
It's not the South Pole.
That's still there, waiting.
And, er, I think an Englishman should get there first.
Well, Bill? What do you say?
There's my work for the Grouse Commission.
That's no obstacle.
We shan't be leaving for at least a year.
I think my exploring days are over.
I don't want to get somewhere first just for the sake of doing it.
Now, if it had been a rather different proposition, if the idea was to go back and carry on all the jobs we started on the Discovery expedition...
But that is the idea, Bill. That's it.
We'll do better.
We'll work on the Barrier, on the mountains, right up to the Pole.
Ours will be the best equipped expedition.
Dozens of scientists under that most eminent of all scientists: Dr Wilson.
Yes, that is different!
Come with me, Bill.
I couldn't let him go without me, could I, Oriana?
No.
Thank you.
Well, I wonder if the motor will start.
Yes, I wonder. You can't possibly go without having something to eat.
No, of course not.
That's the fly you caught the two-pounder on, in the burn at Clachen.
- Remember?
- Yes.
It's a long time ago now.
Look, the gut's all perished.
So it is.
Oh, darling!
Darling!
- Morning, Teddy.
- Oh, good morning, sir.
What have you got there?
Well, it's a... It's a sort of cash chart.
That's the target, there's the date, sir, and the contributions coming in.
Hm. Long way to go yet.
Anything in the post?
Not much money but plenty of people.
"Dear and honoured sir,
"if I could be allowed to join your expedition
"I would even become a British subject."
Here's one from a Bluecoat boy. He says,
"It's frightfully cold in my dormitory so I'm sure I should be all right."
Let him down lightly. Anything else?
No big cheque, I'm afraid.
Oh, some details about your lecture tour, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
There's a young lady here about a dog.
A dog?
Oh, show her in, Caroline.
Name, please, Miss?
Helen Field.
- Chair, Teddy.
- Yes, sir.
Please sit down, Miss Field.
Thank you.
I've brought you the money for a sledge dog.
You said we might.
Anyone, I mean. In your appeal.
How very kind of you, Miss Field.
- My name is Scott.
- Yes, I know that.
And this is Lieutenant Evans, my second in command.
I didn't know that.
How are you? I hope you're well.
- How are you, Teddy?
- Oh, very well, thank you, indeed.
Look, here's the envelope with the money from the school.
And...
You know, Miss Field, when business firms send us cheques, we're pleased enough, but somehow this means more.
Please thank them tremendously.
- Tell me, how many are there?
- 300, nearly.
Well, please thank them all.
We intend to call the dogs by the names of any schools that give them.
Rugby, Fettes, that sort of thing.
What's the name of your school?
South Hampstead High School for Girls.
Yes. I think we'd better just call him Hampstead.
Thank you for having turned out on such a dirty night to hear this talk.
During the past few days
I have had the pleasure, or rather, I should say, the great pleasure of addressing meetings like this all over the country.
And knowing, as I do, the rivalry that exists among our towns and cities
I am hoping that, as the result of this rivalry,
I shall be able to report to my committee in London that your city has gone one, if not a great deal, better than your fellow cities.
Um, thank you.
Well, I'm sure we're all very grateful to Captain Scott for coming and giving us this illuminating account of the Antarctic and I'm sure that if anyone wants to ask any questions
Captain Scott will be only too pleased to answer them.
Mr Chairman, I'm not averse to subscribing to anything that might be in the national interest, but it does occur to me to ask, why must this country send another expedition?
What about the Norwegians?
What about Nansen?
Nansen has given up polar exploration.
He's getting on, you know.
What about that other fellow?
Amundsen? He's making for the North Pole, not the South.
What's the difference?
What's the prospect of trade between this city and the South Pole?
Is there any coal down there, anything I can buy or sell?
I'm sorry we didn't raise more for you, but I suppose every penny counts.
Better luck somewhere else.
Are you sure I can't give you a lift?
It's not far out of my way.
No, please don't bother.
Well, then, I'll just wish you a good night and good luck.
Thank you. Good night.
Captain Scott?
Yes?
Glad I've caught you.
I've come from India.
Want to join your show, if you'll have me.
Good with horses.
Do you mean to tell me you've come 6,000 miles
- to join my expedition?
- Yes. Landed this morning.
- Who are you?
- My name's Oates.
- I'm with the Inniskillings.
- Hm.
No sense in getting soaked, is there?
That's better.
- Cavalryman, eh?
- Yes, sir, dragoons.
- Know anything about the Antarctic?
- Only what I've read.
When I saw you were taking ponies,
I thought perhaps I'd come in handy.
- Fit?
- As a fiddle.
- Age?
- Married?
- No.
- It will be tough.
- I know.
- As Hades.
- But not so warm, eh?
But I think we can manage it.
- We?
- That's what I said.
- Do you mean you'll take me?
- Glad to.
- You're on the strength.
- I say.
- Here's a tram. Come on.
- I say, just a moment.
This any good?
- This is for £1,000.
- Yes. Any good?
'Instead of sitting waiting for the money to come in,
'I'm taking the opportunity of trying out my motor sledges.'
You see the idea, Dr Nansen?
The wheels make their own road as it goes along.
- What do you think of it?
- Yes, what do you think?
I'm afraid Dr Nansen doesn't like motors, dear.
That is so.
I like dogs.
I can't help feeling that we should use every modern invention that comes along.
Somebody's got to try these things out.
I even thought of taking a wireless telegraph apparatus, but it's too heavy.
You are right, Captain, but I like dogs.
Yes, yes, that's what Amundsen says too.
I've been hearing about his plans for the North Pole.
Amundsen's a pupil of mine, as you might say, so of course he believes in dogs.
Well, perhaps I'm prejudiced, but I should hate to repeat the experience I had on the Discovery expedition.
You see, we look on dogs rather differently, more as... well, more as friends.
Captain, a friend in need is a friend indeed.
This Antarctic of yours is a cold and cruel place.
Even worse than the North.
A dog is an animal.
When a dog is finished, he is still some use to other dogs, and even to man if need be.
That machine of yours, when it is finished, it's just a heap of metal in the snow.
You cannot eat it.
That's true, and I am not forgetting the lessons of the past, but I want to take the new things as well.
I shall take dogs, ponies and motors.
Well, I would take dogs, dogs and dogs.
Hello, Bill. Morning, Cherry.
- Morning.
- Good to see you.
- How's Kathleen?
- Splendid. Come along in.
- Morning, Atch.
- And the baby?
Peter? Wonderful, bald as a coot.
Morning, sir.
I'd know that mug anywhere.
Come out of it, Taff Evans.
I was rather surprised you didn't apply to come with me again this time, Evans.
Didn't have to, sir.
I knew you'd send for me sooner or later.
My release is through at last.
I'm afraid there's no hurry, Bill.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Teddy.
Have a look at that.
At the rate the money's coming in, you could go on carving up grouse till Christmas.
Rather depressing. Time's getting on.
And none of us are getting any younger. not to make any more appointments.
He turned up from the Persian Gulf this morning, sir.
I couldn't say you wouldn't see him.
Indian Marine Lieutenant.
Doesn't say how old he is.
26, sir.
Today as a matter of fact.
- May I come in, sir?
- Well, you are in, aren't you?
There's more to come, sir, with permission.
- The door was open, sir.
- True.
I heard my name and I think I did mention my age, sir.
There, sir, 26.
Is that real or something you stuffed inside your coat?
Quite real, sir.
Hm. Bill, how's this?
Well, I'd rather he hit Teddy than me.
- May he hit Teddy?
- Mm, I don't see why not.
Excuse me, sir, but I'm a good deal senior to Bowers.
Pity.
- Sit down, Bowers.
- Thank you, sir.
Why do you want to join this show?
I suppose you want to be among the first to reach the Pole. Is that it?
- Out for a bit of white ribbon, eh?
- No, sir.
I know it sounds stupid to say I want adventure, but, er...
What do you mean by adventure?
Well, sir, to get some extra knowledge of the stars and land and weather and...
And?
Other men's jobs.
Well, Bowers, to date we've had 6,042 applications.
I'm afraid I've made up my mind we can't take anybody else.
Hello? Oh, good morning, Sir Clements.
What?
The grant is through.
How much?
I see. Yes, yes, of course.
Well, thank you very much for letting us know at once.
Yes. Goodbye, sir.
- How much?
- A lot short of what we wanted.
- Yes, but it makes it just possible.
We shall have to cut down a bit, that's all.
- How about my side of things?
- Don't worry.
I won't cut a penny on your side.
I promised you the greatest scientific expedition that ever left England.
- How on earth will we do it?
- One ship instead of two. There she is.
We can go, Bill. We're going.
What do you want?
Oh, yes, I was just going to kick you out, wasn't I?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll take you. How's that?
- Thank you, sir.
- Right.
- Oh, Bowers.
- Yes, sir?
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you very much, sir.
'The first leg of our journey, halfway round the world.'
Cherry.
Just a minute, son. Just a minute.
Excuse me, sir.
Oi, Jehu, stop it!
Could you tell me where Captain Scott is, please?
That's right, sonny. You come to Uncle.
He's a Russian, he don't understand.
Ah, this is for the owner. Up there.
Not on the bridge, on the poop deck.
Telegram, Captain Scott.
Oh? Oh, thank you.
Thanks.
- Any message for Peter?
- Tell him I'll bring him a penguin.
Excuse me.
Good bye.
God bless and keep you, my dearest, until...
All visitors ashore! Come along, please!
Think of me when you make those footmarks.
Every step of the way.
Up gangway!
Hold on!
All right, carry on.
This is a bit thick, thousands of miles from the nearest bookie.
- What's up?
- Red-hot tip for the National.
- Is that a race?
- A race? Why...
Hook, line and sinker!
- Hard luck, Titus.
- Thank you.
The Grouse Commission are thinking of us.
- Splendid.
- They don't say what, of course.
Here's a good one, sir.
"Love to Hampstead and kind regards to the rest of you,
"Helen Fields."
Oh, wait a minute.
I've got another one here somewhere.
"I'm going south, Amundsen."
- South?
- But I thought it was understood.
- Everyone thought it was understood.
- I can't believe it.
It's perfectly true. Read it yourself.
From Madeira. That means he's started.
- Why didn't he tell anyone?
- Not very sporting.
He's changed his mind.
Anyone's allowed to change his mind.
He was going north, now he's going south.
That's all.
It means a lot to you, doesn't it, getting there first?
Of course it does.
You know damn well it does.
The Antarctic's a big enough thing to be up against without this fellow butting in.
Why has he suddenly changed his mind?
He's trying to make a race of it and we're not rigged for racing.
Quite, Con, quite.
What on earth would you do with all us scientists?
We'd be falling over each other.
You're right, Bill. You're right.
This is a scientific expedition.
I am not going to be stampeded and I am not going to take any risks.
In fact, I'm not going to race.
I wonder what route the blighter's taking.
'Wonderful to be free at last from problems so difficult to handle.
'Whatever lies ahead,
I am now on my own ground.'
There you are, sir. The Great Ice Barrier.
400 miles long and 100 foot high.
'This is obviously the best place,
'a sloping shore and a good stretch of bay ice.'
Steady, keep her straight on the lines.
Mush! Mush!
'With ponies, motor sledges, dogs and men parties,
'we've done an excellent job of transporting.
'Bowers proves a perfect treasure.
'There's not a single case he doesn't know
'or a single article which he cannot find at once.
'So, we are landed and the hut is up eight days after our arrival.
'A very good record.'
Sir.
- What is it, McKenzie?
- Beg pardon, sir.
We were wondering if you'd take old puss with you to the Pole, sir.
- Sure to show up well against the snow.
- Yes, sir.
Hear, hear, sir.
He'd show up well anywhere.
No, no, it's very good of you fellows to suggest it, but I mustn't take the luck from the ship.
- Great minds think alike, eh?
- Yes, sir.
- Goodbye, Pennell.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Best of luck to you all.
- And to you.
Thanks. See you in about... well, a year's time.
Yes, sir.
'The ship will drop Campbell's party up the coast
'on her way back to New Zealand.
'What news shall we have for her when she returns next summer, I wonder.
'There is much for us all to do while the daylight lasts.
'When the sun does go, we shan't see him for half a year.'
Oi, oi, oi!
Hello.
Oi, don't go away.
Come back. There's nothing to worry about.
Well, the winter's almost on us now, and that means sitting tight here for the next six months.
Seems a good moment to run over what's ahead when the sun comes back.
This chart makes things pretty easy to understand, I think.
- Can you see all right at the back?
- Yes, thank you, sir.
We're here, just above the sea ice.
The first stage is the Great Ice Barrier.
About 400 miles to cross.
Then come mountains 9,000 feet high.
We get up them by the Beardmore Glacier.
There's over 100 miles of that.
Lastly, the plateau.
Another 350 miles along that to the Pole.
Now, about ways and means.
The secret of travel in the Antarctic is food and fuel.
Hot food will take a man further than cold food.
And remember, there's no such thing as living off the country.
Every ounce will have to be carried and depot'd all the way along the route to supply us on the way home.
Give me a hand with the other one, Bill, will you?
Now, you see these depots marked here?
Up to the last, One Ton.
These are the ones we put down this summer in order to save weight next summer.
Beyond, on the outward journey, the southern party will put down more depots every so often.
The whole resources of the entire party will be devoted to getting four men into a position from which they can make their final bid for the Pole.
Outward to the foot of the glacier, tractors, ponies and dogs will haul as much as they can as far as they can.
From then on, we'll ask no more of machines and animals.
It'll be up to us.
From the glacier to the Pole and all the way back, man-hauling.
Now, the time margin is very small.
We've found already that our ponies can't stand the lowest temperatures.
So it will mean starting later than I'd hoped.
And we shall have to move faster than Shackleton did to have any chance of reaching the Pole and getting back.
Getting back, mark you, before the darkness and winter blizzards set in again.
Now, is that all clear? Any questions?
- I know one I'd like to ask him.
- Which four, eh?
It's the ship. She's back.
- What's the trouble, Pennell?
- Came across Amundsen.
- Where?
- Bay of Whales.
The Bay of Whales, eh?
400 miles away.
That's practically next door out here.
- How many men has he got with him?
- Only 19 all told, sir.
He has more than 100 dogs.
Never seen so many dogs.
He's got some cheek.
We found this place first.
Fellow has a million miles of ice to choose from and he has to pick ours.
Ah, well, the Antarctic's big enough.
Right, Pennell. Thanks for the news.
Now, you'd better get out again before the sea freezes over.
I shall be glad when we've finished with the Pole and we can get down to some real work, won't you, Bill?
- Hot char anywhere?
- Oh, shut that door, Birdie!
- Giving tongue all right, aren't they?
- Mm.
Well, good night, all.
Good night, Ponko.
Brrrr!
Good night, Uncle Bill.
Good night, Atch.

Hurray!
On the outside grows the fur side
On the inside grows the skin side
So the fur side is the outside and the skin side is the inside
One side likes the skin side inside and the fur side on the outside
Others like the skin side outside and the fur side on the inside
If you turn the skin side outside, thinking you will side with that side
Then the soft side, fur side's inside, which, some argue, is the wrong side
If you turn the fur side outside as you say it grows on that side
Then your outside's next to the skin side which for comfort's not the right side
For the skin side is the cold side and your outside's not your warm side
And two cold sides side by side are not right sides, one side decides
If you decide to side with that side, turn the top side fur side inside
Then the cold side, hard side, skin side is beyond all question inside out
Well done that man! Well done that man!
Well done, Bowers!

Christopher, you're a toad.
Well, you're in good form, Soldier.
How about these fellows?
Not too dusty, considering.
Will they get us across the Barrier in the spring?
Can't say yet.
There's one or two
I'm a bit worried about.
Nobby's all right.
And so is James Pigg.
Old Jehu, I'm not so sure.
This fellow Amundsen, can he do it, do you think, just with dogs?
Can't say, Soldier, can't say.
These Norwegians are better with dogs than we are and... our using these chaps means making a later start.
His base is 80 miles nearer the Pole, but he'll be crossing unknown country.
Seems to me it all depends on whether he finds another way up to the plateau.
It's just a matter of luck.
But they're tough people, Soldier.
No doubt about that.
'It's glorious to stand bathed in brilliant sunshine once more.
'The future is in the lap of the gods.
'I can think of nothing left undone to deserve success.'
- Come along, Crean.
- Just a minute, sir.
Hurry up, Ponko.
- Hurry up, Teddy.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Right, Lashly. Let's have another go.
Right-oh, Teddy.
Good luck. Right-oh, Day.
Come on, the Baltic Fleet.
'The slowest ponies first
'with Atkinson, Wright, Keohane.'
Birdie!
'Bowers, Crean, Cherry-Garrard.
'Evans with Snatcher.
'Evans is a tower of strength, as sound and as hard as ever.
'Wilson with Nobby.
'Oates with Christopher,
'the biggest handful of the lot.
'And myself with Snippetts.'
Good luck!
'16 men all told.
'Four days out, all ponies going well.'
Mush! Mush!
Mush! Mush!
'There's nothing like Antarctic air for sharpening the appetite.
'We're always ready for our mug of pemmican hoosh,

Here you are, Stareek.
Hampstead!
"Just a heap of metal in the snow."
There's still the other one.
I hope so, Bill. I certainly hope so.
I'm afraid that's it, sir.
Well, we'll just have to man-haul our load till the others catch us up.
'Both motors have fallen out.
'Now all depends on the ponies.'
Whoa, back!
Whoa, Christopher! Whoa, back!
'We've taken to marching by the midnight sun,
'so that the ponies get rested at the warmest time of the day.'
Sir, I've been totting up on the hay we have aboard.
Is none of them ponies coming back?
Afraid not, Crean.
Soon meat, Stareek.
Much meat.
Fresh meat.
'We are now more than halfway to the glacier,
'but it's still rather touch and go with the ponies.'
There it is.
Hey, Teddy!
Teddy!
Sir.
Congratulations.
150 miles since the motors let you down.
- Well done, the lot of you.
- Thank you.
Will they manage it, Soldier?
Shall we get them as far as the glacier?
Old Jehu's about done, I'm afraid.
Still, he's paid his way.
It's strange, but when I write to Oriana,
I can see so clearly the place the letter's going to.
I mean, where she is.
But her face itself is always misty.
Yes.
Yes, I know what you mean.
When I try to see Kathleen there's always some feature
I can't quite get.
Very odd that. I feel just the same about an old horse of mine.
I can see the paddock all right, but can't get the old chap's muzzle.
Well, this is as far as we go together.
- Thank you, Day. Thank you, Hooper.
- Thank you, sir.
- Goodbye.
- Good luck, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't forget the letters, Day.
- No, sir.
- Ready?
- Right.
- Goodbye, you fellows.
- Goodbye.
Jehu.
Atch.
'The blizzard has lost us five days already
'and we are now well behind Shackleton's time.
'We must get the ponies on a little further.'
We can't be far from the glacier now, but wherever we are, this is the finish.
Crean.
Birdie!
Now, Christopher, old man.
Look!
Well, they did it.
I congratulate you, Titus.
And I thank you, Titus.
The glacier tomorrow, Bill.
- Dimitri?
- Sir?
Here's the mail.
Goodbye and good luck.
Goodbye, sir.
Good luck.
- Goodbye, Dimitri.
- Goodbye, Ruski.
- Good luck, boy.
- Dos vedanya!
Mush! Mush!
Well, goodbye, Meares.
Have a good run home.
Thank you, sir, and the best of luck to you.
Thanks.
Mush!
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Mother Meares.
'12 men with three sledges, man-hauling.'
Brandy, Uncle Bill? What's this for?
The use of that, my dear Titus, is purely medicinal.
Kindly hand it to me.
'We've climbed 4,000 feet.
'We've been toiling for five days but are barely halfway up.
'Surely we were right not to bring the dogs on.'
Halt.
That way.
Aye, aye, sir.
Ready? Heave.
Ready?
Heave.
Birdie?
Better leave a flag here.
Seems to be a good way up.
Aye, aye, sir.
See that nunatak?
That's what Shackleton called
Buckley Island.
Top of the glacier, sir?
Yes, that's right. Our last big climb.
At this rate, sir, we should be at the top in time for our Christmas dinner.
That's right, Lashly.
Merry Christmas is the word.
Take the strain, Crean.
Toss him a line, Birdie.
- You all right, Lashly?
- Yes, sir.
Sure to be. It's my birthday too.
Many happy returns, Lashly.
Right, Birdie.
Right, Crean. Bowline.
Heave.
Bowline.
Taff, caramel?
Thank you, sir.
- Con?
- Thank you, Bill.
- Atch?
- Thank you, Uncle Bill.
Soldier, you're a marvel.
Well, Christmas comes but once a year.
Christmas comes and Atch goes, eh?
Yes, worst luck.
Thank you.
Pemmican and pony?
How do you do it, Titus?
Perfectly simple.
Been giving you short rations all week.
Oh!
- Well, it was worth it.
- Thank you, sir.
Atch.
Yes?
What do you have to have to be given brandy?
Leprosy.
Plague.
Or just an ordinary fit.
- Fit, eh?
- Hm.
- Er, more, sir?
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, sorry, sir.
- That's all right, Atch.
We are a bit crowded in here tonight.
We ought to eat by numbers.
- Don't put too much faith in numbers.
- Carry on, Evans.
- Story coming.
- Well, hardly a story exactly, sir.
But I remember when we was at Whale Island, we had a PO gunnery instructor.
He was on one of them guns with the new-fangled breech action.
Good, but tricky.
You had to press the button near the breech with your left thumb and then whang in the block with your right hand.
Trouble was, some on the course gets so excited, they gets the movements too close together.
In goes the block and off comes the top of their thumb.
This PO gets tired of seeing a lot of people wandering about with no tops to their thumbs and he calls the class together and he says, "Now, listen, you flat-footed soldiers.
"Let's have no more of this.
"I'll demonstrate the drill to you slowly, by numbers.
"One, I opens the breech.
"Two, I presses the button with my left thumb.
"And three, I sends home the block with my right hand.
"And that's how you lose the top of your bloody thumb."
Keep back! Keep back!
Oh! Brandy!
Brandy! Brandy!
- That's out of date, Titus.
- Brandy.
This is the modern treatment.
No, Uncle Bill! Uncle Bill, stop it!
No, stop it!
No!
'9,000 feet up,
'the Barrier and the glacier behind us.
'It should be level-going now, all the way to our goal.'
- Goodbye, Atch.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Look out for us in March.
- Right.
With any luck, we'll be back before the ship has to go.
- I hope I haven't disappointed you.
- No, no, Cherry.
It was a sheer toss-up whether you or Titus went on from here.
- Was it really?
- Mm.
- Who's going to go on the last lap?
- I don't suppose it's settled yet.
Four out of the eight of us.
We're all hoping.
Ready?
Heave.
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Ted.
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, you fellows.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Atch.
'Eight men with two sledges, man-hauling.'
- This wind!
- Help us on the way back, though.
Hardest decision of the lot, Bill.
And the one where you can't help me.
Can we depot our skis here, sir?
Help lighten our sledge.
Yes, all right.
Leave your lot here.
The return party can pick them up.
Whoever they are.
We'll make our lunch camp here, let you get ahead a bit.
'Is my team the best?
'Is it?
'Are we all at our best?
'Bill and I? Yes, all right, that's two.
'And Taff Evans, of course.
'Soldier? Soldier too, then. All right.
'Our four.
'Our four.
'What about Teddy's?'
Halt.
Carry on, Bill.
Ready?
Heave.
'The best four men.
'The best... Who are the best four?
Teddy?
'Birdie?
'Lashly?
'Crean?'
Last letters home go tomorrow.
You're too big, both of you.
What the Captain wants is a middler, about 5' 8".
- And what might you be?
Oh!
Here comes the Captain.
Well done, lads. First-class job.
Lashly, Crean.
It's only fair to tell you now that you'll not be coming on with us.
I'm very sorry indeed.
You've done splendidly and I shall never forget it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
And me, sir?
- You'll be coming on.
- Thank you, sir.
Good for you, Taff.
You're a lucky devil, Taff.
You always were.
Teddy?
Yes, sir?
About tomorrow.
I've given a lot of thought to the matter, and I've decided that my four should go on.
I see, sir.
There's one other thing.
I want to take Bowers.
If you can spare him.
- Five, sir?
- Yes.
Right.
And, Teddy?
Sorry.
Thank you, sir.
I'm taking five, Bill.
- Five?
- Yes, you, me, Bowers, Oates and Taff Evans as the strongest and biggest.
A scientist, two sailors and a soldier.
What better companions could a man have, eh?
'Dear Kathleen,
'a last note from a hopeful position.
'I think it's going to be all right.'
- Goodbye, Crean.
- Goodbye, Lashly. Best of luck.
- Goodbye, Lashly.
- Goodbye, sir.
Well, Teddy, we couldn't have got this far without you.
Thank you, sir, and good luck.
Thanks. See you sometime in March, eh?
Ready?
Heave.
Let's give them a cheer, lads.
- Hurray!
- Hurray!
'Five men with one sledge,
'man-hauling.
'This surface is horrible.
'Crystals like sand.
'Bowers on foot has the hardest time of it,
'but he's an undefeated little sportsman.'
- Not ready yet, Titus?
- No, not yet.
Latitude 88:25, sir.
- Farthest south, eh?
- Good-oh.
- Beyond Shackleton at last.
- That's great, sir.
Something the matter with your hand?
Only a cut, sir. It's nothing.
I heals easy.
At least, I do at home.
'Cooking for five takes a seriously longer time than cooking for four.
'It's an item I had not considered when reorganising.'
'Can we keep up these marches?
'It's a critical time.
'But we ought to do the trick.'
How far now, sir?
About 27 miles, two good marches.
I'm sorry but my sleeping bag is not on the sledge.
Halt.
It can't have fallen further back than our last halt.
May I go, sir?
I'm coming with you.
Can't trust myself to speak, sir.
Well, don't, then, Taff.
'We only had to go back a couple of miles,
'but it cost us two whole hours.'
Can't be more than five miles now, sir.
Sir.
There.
Amundsen.
Look.
Well, I suppose it was meant to be.
They've left their names.
There were five of them, apparently.
And there's a letter for the King of Norway with a note asking Captain Scott to be so kind as to deliver it.
He's forgotten to stamp it.
Birdie, you'd better check the position.
'The Pole.
'Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected.
'It's a bitter disappointment,
'and I am very sorry for my loyal companions.'
Smile, please.
'The wind is blowing hard,
'and there is that curious damp feeling in the air which chills one to the bone.
'Great God, this is an awful place.'
'January 18th. All the daydreams must go.
'Now for the run home and a desperate struggle.
'I wonder if we can do it.'
Cherry asked me to give you this at the Pole.
Well done that man.
Sorry you chaps don't like chocolate.
- Soldier.
- Thank you, sir.
- Bill.
- Thank you.
- Birdie.
- Thank you, sir.
- Evans.
- Thank you, sir.
That hand still bothering you?
Hardly at all now, sir.
Well, lads, only 900 miles to go.
Ready?
Heave.
Ready?
Heave.
This is better, eh?
Birdie?
Your skis must be round here somewhere.
- Keep an eye open for them.
- Aye, aye, sir.
'The wind is playing strange tricks.
'Instead of blowing steadily northward, as it did when we came,
'it keeps dropping and leaving us the full weight of the sledge.'
Land-ho!
'I don't like the easy way
Oates and Evans get frostbitten.'
- Sir?
- Mm?
- You know where Teddy turned back.
- Yes. What about it?
According to that note of his, we've done the same distance half a day better.
Half a day. Do you hear that, Soldier?
We're half a day better than Teddy.
Good-oh!
A day's march nearer home, Birdie.
A day's march nearer steaks.
Large, thick, juicy, sizzly ones.
Oh, don't.
With mushrooms.
And beer.
And beer?
Beer of course, gallons of it.
Had an awful nightmare the other night, Birdie.
Dreamt that Simpson's had been burnt down.
Hello, Bill. What have you got this time?
Quite an interesting day.
This hoosh smells good. Yours, Con?
Birdie reckons we've done half a day's better time than Teddy did.
Good, good.
What are these, Bill?
Sea plants mostly, and some tree fossils.
Good heavens. This must have been quite a warm spot once upon a time.
And look at this.
Coal, by Jove.
"What's the prospect of trade between this city and the Antarctic?"
Coal, Evans. Catch.
Ooh!
- What's the matter, man?
- It's nothing, sir.
Quite all right.
Only a bit awkward, that's all.
'I am indeed glad to think that we've done with the plateau.
'Another week of those conditions might have had a very bad effect on Evans.'
See your flag anywhere, Birdie?
No sign of it, sir.
We'll try a bit back and to the right.
Evans, off with your harness.
Take the aft end of the sledge.
Understand?
Aye, aye, sir.
'There is no doubt
Evans is a good deal run down.
'I think Wilson, Bowers and I are as fit as possible,
'but Oates feels the cold and fatigue more than we do.'
Look out, steady!
There it is, sir. There's the flag.
A shadow.
'Evans keeps saying, as he would, that he's quite well.
'How can a man be quite well with hands like that?'
Halt.
Can't be far now.
Birdie, try up that hill.
See if you can see the cairn.
Right, sir.
What's wrong, Evans?
It's loose, sir. It's come loose, sir.
Have it right in a moment.
Hold on. I'll do it.
You get your harness off.
It's only my old hand, sir.
Makes me a bit slow.
I can't see the cairn, but I can see the Barrier.
How's that?
Try and move your foot.
- Sure you can manage?
- I'll be fine, sir.
That's the man, Taff. Take your time.
We'll be camping soon.
Ready? Heave.
Halt.
What is it, Taff?
I'm all right, sir, quite well.
Taff?
'It is a terrible thing to lose a companion in this way,
'to leave him here after all the miles we've sledged together.'
Plateau done, glacier done.
400 miles of Barrier and we're home.
We've got to do more miles a day, Bill.
We ought to find it warmer down here, anyhow.
Sir.
60 degrees of frost.
Can't last.
'Only five miles again yesterday.
'This will never do.'
Ready?
No, no, no.
Tortoise beat the hare in the end.
Right, Soldier?
Ready, sir.
Heave.
'There is no getting away from the fact that we are not going strong.
'And I'm afraid Soldier's foot is bad.'
When I get home,
I'm never going to walk another step.
- Ride wherever I go.
- Even in London?
London.
- Know the Empire promenade, Birdie?
- Funny thing, I've never been.
First night home, I'll be there.
You must take me with you, Titus.
But you'll have to leave your horse outside.
I ought to tell you that we haven't too much fuel in hand.
If we're still short at Mount Hooper, we'll try going on cold meals.
We may have no choice.
Funny, used to have what they call a good leg for a boot.
Wouldn't think it now, would you, Bill?
Bill, what chance have I got?
A good one, Titus.
How far is it to Mount Hooper depot now?
Eight and a half miles.
We'll do it in no time, Soldier.
Purely medicinal.
'What shall we find at Mount Hooper depot?
'If oil is short again...'
There she is.
See, old chap?
Managed it all right.
- Wasn't so bad.
- Get the spades, Birdie.
Here it is.
It's not full.
The seal's not broken.
Odd things happen out here.
It must be evaporation.
Yes, but...
Come on, chaps.
No good arguing the whys and wherefores.
Up tent.
'Among ourselves we are unendingly cheerful.
'But what each man feels in his heart,
I can only guess.'
Letting up a little, I think.
I hope I don't wake tomorrow, Bill.
I'm just going outside.
I may be away some time.
'A brave man and a gallant gentleman.
'This intense cold convinces me
'that the season has broken far earlier than I expected.'
We'll be all right at One Ton.
It's full of stuff.
I thought for a moment it might be old Titus.
Stupid of me.
Sorry.
Only 11 miles now, Bill. Two good marches.
One if the snow holds off.
'Captain Scott is now lying in this tent with a frozen foot.
'I am afraid he will never walk again.
'If the wind drops,
'Birdie and I are going to try to reach the next depot and return.
'We have come together
'1,800 miles,
'and are now only 11 miles from stores in plenty.
'Only 11 miles.'
11 miles.
11 miles.
'Think of me when you make those footmarks.'
'Every step of the way.'
'My own dearest mother,
'I should so like to have come through for your dear sake.
'It is splendid to pass, however,
'with such companions as I have.
'And as all five of us have mothers and wives,
'you will not be alone.
'There will be no shame
'and you will know
I have struggled to the end,
'your ever loving son,
'to the end of this life and the next,
'when God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes.'
'God knows I am sorry to be the cause of sorrow
'to anyone in the world.
'But everyone must die.
'All the things I had hoped to do with you after the expedition
'are as nothing now.
'My only regret is leaving you to struggle through your life alone.
'All is for the best to those who love God.
'And, oh, my Ori, we have both loved him with all our lives.
'All is well.'
'For my own sake,
I do not regret this journey.
'We took risks. We knew we took them.
'Things have come out against us.
'And therefore we have no cause for complaint.
'Had we lived,
'I should have had a tale to tell
'of the hardihood, endurance and courage of my companions,
'which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman.
'It seems a pity,
'but I don't think I can write more.
'These rough notes and our dead bodies
'must tell the tale.
'For God's sake,
'look after our people.'
Halt.

Doc Holiday just got off the stagecoach.
- Want me and the boys to come along?
- Why do you ask that?
Well, I certainly wouldn't want to fool around with him alone.
I don't blame ya, but I'm not gonna make any trouble for Doc Holiday.
He's my best friend.
As long as I'm sheriff around here the place is his.
Hi. Where's Doc Holiday?
In here, Pat.
Hi, Pat.
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.
Doc, how are you?
You're looking plenty sassy.
You wintered kind of fat, didn't you?
- What are you doing over this way?
- I wanted to have a talk with you.
The other is, have you seen anything of a little strawberry roan?
- Somebody steal your horse?
- Yeah.
Cutest little fellow you ever saw.
Mean as mean, but I'd dote on him like he was pure rock candy.
- What are you laughing at?
- Joke's on whoever done it.
First time I ever felt sorry for a horse thief.
- Did you hear he was headed this way?
- Yeah.
Put that on the table in there.
What are you gonna have?
I started with rye.
I don't see no cause to change.
- Where you been keeping yourself?
- Mostly across the border.
That's what I want to see you about.
I need a little money and I thought you might want to come in with me.
- What's the matter?
- I'll let you have the money... but if the deal is like that last one of yours, better not tell me about it.
Why not?
- Where'd you get that thing?
- They stuck it on me little while ago.
You're the last man I ever thought would be so easily satisfied.
Man's gotta settle down sometime.
Mike, did you see anything of a strange strawberry roan?
About 13 hands high and as cute as bug's ear.
Seems to me I did see one about that size.
- When I came on duty.
- Where?
- Up in front of the dentist place.
- Where's that?
I'll show you.
I'm only gonna tell you once more.
You put that glass... on top of your head.
But what are you gonna do then?
Just put it up on your head.
I'll show you.
Best thing in the world for that dandruff of yours.
Wait a minute, Doc.
Hello, Fred.
Hello, Pat.
You're still using that one, huh?
My old standby.
Never has failed yet.
How many fingers do you see, Fred?
I guess I better take Fred to the jail and let him sober up there.
You go ahead. The dentist's place is up the street near the corner.
I'll be along in a minute.
Well, Red, how ya feelin'?
Hello.
- Nice little horse you got here.
- I think so.
- Where'd you get him?
- Bought him in Santa Fe Springs. Why?
Somebody stole him from me in Sacora.
If it wasn't for those two guns,
I'd say you was hiding in pretty young.
- You think it was me?
- You haven't told me any different.
I ain't going to.
My name's Holiday.
Doc Holiday?
- I've heard of you.
- Thanks.
I don't want to take advantage of you.
Thanks. I thought it'd be the other way around.
What's your name, son?
Bonny. William Bonny.
- Billy the Kid, huh?
- Still think I stole your horse?
- How much did you pay for him?
- Wouldn't do any good if I told you.
- Why not?
- I like the horse and got used to him.
- So have I.
- I don't blame you.
- Just like sitting in a rocking chair.
- Now look...
- Hear you're pretty good.
- That's what I hear about you.
All right. You mind standing away from the front of that horse?
Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?
No sense in going to all this trouble for nothing.
That's right.
Hello, Doc.
Had any luck?
- Yes and no.
- It's your horse, ain't it?
It was.
You're a cool one.
Better get you over to the hoosegow before this gets around.
Come along. Thanks, Doc, for being so forbearing.
All right.
See why I left off?
He's just a kid.
I told you to come along.
Didn't you hear what I said?
I heard you.
You're not doing any better than I did.
Wait a minute. I'd like to make you acquainted with this young man.
Billy, this is an old friend of mine, Pat Garrett.
Pat, this is Mr. William Bonny.
I've been wanting to meet you for a long time.
How are you, Billy?
How many fingers do you see?
You ought to use that only on friends.
While you two are talking I better put my horse away. Back up, boy.
- Why you...
- Hold it. Don't fly off the handle.
Nice little horse, ain't he, Doc?
- Remember me?
- Where's Mr. Garrett?
I sent him home. How 'bout you and me having a little talk?
I don't believe in talk, unless the other fella holds all the cards.
Sonny, that head of yours sure is screwed on tight.
If it wasn't, somebody would have knocked it off long ago.
I guess that's right. How did you know
Pat was gonna hit you out there?
Well, it's the first time a sheriff ever wanted to shake hands with me.
- He heard you say "shake hands."
- Huh?
How do you do, Mr. Horse?
I'm pleased to meet you.
I'll swear, I didn't know he could do tricks.
What else can he do?
You back up there and I'll make him take those gloves right out of your belt.
Over that way a little.
Now back a little farther.
That's far enough, kid.
Put your hands up.
All right, Doc.
- This is new for you, ain't it?
- What?
Bein' arrested for horse stealin'.
Doc, you know I didn't steal that horse any more than you did.
Billy, many a true word is spoken in jest.
This is something new for you too, isn't it, Doc?
Yeah, what's that?
The Great Doc Holiday getting someone else to help him.
And a policeman at that.
I can hardly believe it.
And after the way I've heard people talk about you... ever since I was in short pants.
That's enough of that.
Turn around.
- Now walk out that door.
- Wait a minute.
Why?
Well, this thing don't seem to sit right on my stomach, no how.
What?
Doc, you're not gonna back out on me?
I'm afraid I am.
I'd never hear the end of this.
Hold on!
I'm not through with you yet.
Step aside, Doc.
He may shoot me in the back.
They tell me that's the way you've given it to some of the boys.
Now, Pat, that's a pretty strong thing to say.
I never heard that.
Well, Mr. Garrett, if you believe that... here's your chance to do the same to me.
Coming, Doc?
I think I will.
I want the two of you out of this town by sundown.
What did I do?
That's all right, Doc.
You've got the right to choose your friends.
Shucks. I don't take kindly to that at all.
He knows there's no stage until tomorrow... and he knows that I'm afoot.
Or am I?
- Not by a darn sight.
- You mean that, son?
Sure. We'll dig you up another horse somewhere.
- I guess that's enough for me.
- Cleaned out?
Not quite.
- Where you stoppin', son?
- I got a room at the hotel.
Doc, could I see you a minute?
Sure. You might as well cash me in.
All right.
What's on your mind, son?
No offense, Doc, but that last ace you just drew...
What about it?
I got a feeling I saw it on the bottom of the deck.
- Are you sure?
- Wouldn't have asked if I was.
That's where you showed good sense.
Here you are, Doc... 640.
Thanks.
You could have paid four times for the horse and still saved money.
That's right.
Hope you're satisfied now.
- You gonna turn in?
- I think I will.
I'll walk down to the hotel with you.
Good night, gents, and thanks.
Good night.
If you're not already fixed up, you can bunk with me tonight.
No thanks, Billy.
I've got a girl. She and her aunt just moved into town.
You got a girl?
I ain't got nothin', except that horse.
You can't fool me. A good-looking boy like you must have a girl somewhere.
No. I don't trust 'em.
You're pretty young to talk like that.
Well, I've known quite a few.
And they all did you dirty, eh, every one of them?
Yeah, every one of 'em.
That's too bad, Billy.
I guess things haven't been so easy for you, have they?
Tell you what I'm going to do.
Since that horse means so much to you,
I'm going to make you a present of him.
That's awful nice of you.
Thanks a lot.
All right. Good night.
See you in the morning.
Good night.
Just thought I'd say good night to the horse.
If you're all through, you might as well put him back in his stall.
All right.
Good night, Red.
See you tomorrow.
What, no kiss?
He don't like mush.
Back in your stall, Red.
- That's my tobacco, isn't it?
- I think it is.
You don't mind if I take that, do you?
Red, I think I'll bunk right here tonight, if you don't object.
Say, what is this anyway?
What are you shooting at me for?
Are you crazy?
Stop it.
Cut it out, do you hear?
Can you understand English?
What's your name?
- Rio.
- What's the rest of it?
McDonald.
Where'd you come from?
What do you care?
- Where'd you live before you came here?
- Sacora.
Oh, yeah. Who was he?
My brother.
He shouldn't have taken so much tequila.
- What became of the girl?
- She married a guy two weeks later.
Well, that's the way it is.
How'd I know he was your brother?
It was him or me.
And I didn't lay for him in no barn neither.
- I'm sorry I was so rough with you.
- You didn't hurt me.
You sure?
- It's too bad I didn't know.
- What?
- He was your brother.
- What's that got to do with it?
Well, maybe I wouldn't have tried so hard to get the other girl.
Oh, you wouldn't.
What's the matter?
- There's a rock under here.
- Let me fix it.
Let me go!
Hold still, lady, or you won't have much dress left.
Let me go!
- He did not.
- I say he did.
- Did you really hear him holler?
- Sure I did.
- So did I.
- Then that ain't Billy the Kid.
Shucks, a dentist can make anybody holler.
Look out.
Here he comes.
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Doc.
- I'm in no hurry.
- You're the Billy the Kid?
- That's what they tell me.
- See, what did I tell you?
- Wait. One at a time.
Have you really got
20 notches in your gun?
Is it true you got 13 Indian scalps in your war bag?
Had to throw 'em away.
The moths got to them.
Tanning 'em the best way to keep them.
- Is that a fact?
- That's what my pa told me.
- What are you doing with that?
- Trying get bark off to make a whistle.
- Have you sucked it?
- I sucked it till it near dry.
Can't you shoot the insides out?
- Put it up on that post.
- Can't I hold it?
- Can you hold it steady?
- Sure!
Billy, you don't have to prove anything to me.
It's all right.
Turn the end up a little.
Little more.
You hit it!
- Don't you take aim?
- I took aim.
- When?
- Before I drew.
Look, Billy, it's all right.
You fixed it fine. Thanks.
- Glad to help.
- Anything I can do, let me know.
- That's a new one on me.
- What?
Aiming before you draw.
- I've got to.
- Why?
My hand seems to be a little quicker than my eye.
Well, ain't that too bad.
- Where'd you get the horse?
- I bought this one.
- Looks all right.
- He'll do for the time being.
Ham and eggs.
Fry the eggs on both sides.
I'll take the same.
Mine straight up.
How 'bout a cold hand while we're waiting?
How much?
- How's that?
- Suits me.
Before you get started
I'd like to speak to you for a minute.
- Who is he?
- I don't know.
- What do you want?
- Let's go in the backroom.
Why?
You don't know me, but we have a mutual friend.
Who?
And I don't like him any better than you do.
Oh, Garrett, eh?
The name sounds familiar.
- Figure on staying in town tonight?
- Why?
Everybody knows that Garrett told you to get out of town.
Sooner or later you're gonna have a little trouble with him.
I thought I might give you a hand.
That's very kind of you, mister.
Listen. I ain't doing you no favor.
It'll be a pleasure.
Now what I figure is when he's arguing with you, he won't watch anyone else.
So, it'll be a cinch for me.
Be careful you don't knock me over with the same bullet.
Don't worry.
I'll stand at an angle.
I'll do it like this.
Suppose this chair is Garrett there.
And if you're standing about where you are... why, I'll be over here.
Do you mind if I draw my gun so you can see the line of fire?
No, go right ahead.
- It's me, Billy.
- Come on in, Doc.
- What happened?
- He's a pretty smart hombre.
You know him?
He's been hanging around trying to talk
Garrett into making him a deputy.
I guess he figured if he got Billy he'd be a hero... he could have the deputy job, or run for governor if he wanted it.
- Better get out of here, son.
- Why? He pulled on me first.
- Be hard to make Garrett believe that.
- We'll see.
Where's my dough?
Well, I guess I must've picked it up.
You're foolish to stick around, son.
I think I'd be more foolish to pull out.
Then Garrett would be sure that was my fault.
Come on. Cut for deal.
- You meant you want to play poker.
- That's right.
You're not worried about me if I tangle with Garrett, are you?
Fights pretty good.
I know him better than you do.
All right, if he's so good... then you'll get your horse back, won't you?
Say, I never thought of that.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- Lend me a hundred.
- I never lend money in a poker game.
Spoils my luck.
But I'd be glad to have you put up the horse for a hundred.
I guess you would.
Hello, Pat.
Care for a bite to eat, boys?
A little hand of poker?
No thanks, Doc.
Were you in there when it happened?
No. But listen, Pat, he pulled on Billy first.
- How do you know?
- His gun was on the floor.
That don't prove nothing.
Pat, you've got an ugly temper and you're letting it get the best of you.
You have no right to hold Billy for this killing, and you know it.
You're just sore at him, that's all.
Doc, I'm gonna give you a chance to stay out of this.
- Thanks.
- Your horse is outside. Get on him.
- Good luck to you.
- Same to you.
What are you waitin' for?
He's waiting for those chickens of yours to hatch.
Are you gonna put up a fight?
I'll tell you one thing.
I ain't going to jail for no killing I was pushed into.
- Thanks, Doc.
- What are you trying to do?
I still think that fella pulled first on Billy.
Are you throwing off on me again?
Then what do you call it?
Since I figure that this is a personal matter between you and Billy...
I don't think you ought to bring in all this hired help.
I only did that to keep Billy from putting up a fight... so I wouldn't have to kill him.
Do you stuff birds too?
You're making a big mistake... turning on an old friend, all because of a little snip... who's never given anybody nothing except the back of his hand.
Speaking of hands...
Come on. Let's get out of here before this hothead makes us plug him.
He ain't gonna run me out of town.
If you wanna hold the fort while
I ride off on your little horse... it's all right with me.
Well, since you put it that way.
Go ahead, son.
Take it easy, Pat.
Doc, this finishes you and me for good and all.
I'm sorry.
- Can you get up, son?
- I don't know.
- Can you make it to the horse?
- I think so.
Did you see what that little horse did, pulling me out like that?
He's a regular bird dog.
I gotta get you under cover some place.
I'm all right.
Charlie, you better stay here and have a look around town.
That kid's got a bullet in him.
He ain't going far. Let's go.
Who's that?
Quit that yelling.
Get these horses out of sight.
This is Billy the Kid.
He got a bad one on the left side... but the bullet didn't hit anything vital and it came out in the back.
Don't move him at all or the bleeding will start again.
I guess you better cut his clothes off.
Put a bandage on the wound and see that it's always moist.
Keep him warm and dry.
If he gets a chill, he's a goner.
If he goes out of his head, tie him down.
The neighbors hear him yelling, tell them your aunt has smallpox.
That'll keep them away.
I guess that's all.
Now do your best for this boy.
If I can't come back,
I'll send word where I am.
And Billy can bring you along.
Shoo, shoo!
Face like a baby.
He's so hot.
He's no hotter than your brother Julio was.
He's soaking wet again.
Get me some sheets,
Aunt Guadalupe.
Get them yourself.
- What's the matter with you?
- I wouldn't lift a finger for him.
What's the matter?
- Been lookin' for him around here.
- Well, ain't that too bad.
Chico, what's the matter with you?
He smells the blood.
He was just getting ready to peck his eyes out.
You stay out of here.
- Your name McDonald?
- What do you wanna know for?
Why don't you wanna tell me?
- Yes, that's my name. Why?
- Your father's name is...
Woodruff. Charlie Woodruff.
I used to work for him when he was Tom Motsacoro.
Oh, yes. I guess I was a little girl then.
- Charlie!
- Aunt Guadalupe!
- How you been?
- Very well. Thank you.
You're getting fat as a pig.
- What are you doing up here?
- I've been working with the sheriff.
We're looking for Billy the Kid.
You get out of here!
- Come in and sit down.
- Some other time.
I'll drop in the first chance I get.
- What's wrong with that bird?
- Nothing.
I have a hen sitting under the bed and he likes to peck at her.
- Want me to get him out of there?
- No. Everything's all upset in there.
We just got up.
Good-bye. I'm glad to have seen you.
Same here.
So long, Aunt Guadalupe.
- I'll walk down a ways with you.
- No, you won't. Lunch is all ready.
Good-bye.
I'll fix you.
How's Billy?
Looks like he's having a chill.
A chill?
Where are you?
Right here.
- Don't go away.
- I won't.
- I'm so cold.
- I'll get you warm.
- Don't go away.
- I'll only be a minute.
How can you stop a thing like this?
- You're mad at me.
- No.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- Why do you hide from me?
- I'll be right back.
- Where's that bottle of whiskey?
- I finished it.
The time I had that bad cough.
I fired those hot stones for Julio, but it was just the same.
He shook like a leaf till he died.
You get out of here and shut the door.
What?
Just get out of here.
Have you gone crazy?
You can bring the minister tomorrow if it'll make you feel better about it.
Now get out.
You're not gonna die.
I'll get you warm.
Well, Red, you can't stand this pace much longer.
I guess I'll just have to slow those boys down a little.
None of my affair, but we crossed the county line ten minutes ago.
That's right, Swanson.
It's none of your affair.
Break up!
Scatter for those rocks!
You look different today.
You look better.
Say, is that you?
What are you doing here?
I live here.
Well, I've been trying to figure this out.
- How'd I get here?
- Doc brought you.
Oh. Are you Doc's girl?
What do you know about that.
Be careful your wound.
You'll hurt yourself.
That's right. I remember now.
- I caught one yesterday, didn't I?
- Yesterday?
It was a month ago.
You've been terribly sick.
A month? That's a long time.
- How's Red?
- Red?
- Have you been takin' good care of him?
- Who's Red?
Didn't Doc leave my horse here?
Well, I'll swear. I didn't think he'd do a thing like that.
Behind my back too.
Is he all right again?
Say, who's this old lollipop?
It's my Aunt Guadalupe.
¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo está?
You haven't got a ham sandwich on you?
You hungry? I don't think we have anything cooked beside some beans.
That'll do for a starter, eh, lollipop?
Say, you don't talk like a sick man.
Who said I was?
What does that "lollipop" mean?
Oh, something sweet.
Sweet?
Sweet, like candy.
You know, dulce.
Is that a fact?
Where are you going?
Oh, to see if I can find a fresh egg or two.
- How do you feel?
- Fine. When do we eat?
- You just had lunch about an hour ago.
- Honest?
Will you bring me my clothes?
I want to have a look around.
What for?
I can't spend the rest of my life in bed.
Anyway, I want to see if I can find my ring.
Your ring?
Yeah. I had a ring on this finger and it's gone.
I've been worried about it.
You mustn't be upset about a thing like that.
You can get another one, can't you?
This one's been kind of lucky for me.
It belonged to a fellow who was supposed to have had a charmed life... as long as he kept it on his finger.
Then how did you get it?
Did you kill him?
No. Somebody else did that.
Then the ring wasn't so lucky for him after all, was it?
Well, nothing happened to him until he took it off to wash his hands.
No, you better not get up till tomorrow.
- You said that yesterday.
- You're not strong enough yet.
Who says I'm not?
Billy, you mustn't.
You'll hurt yourself.
Then why don't you quit wrestling with me?
But you've been so sick.
You're not well enough. You're not...
Rio!
Come on. I want you to go down to the store with me.
I have some washing to do.
You've got all afternoon to do it.
Come on.
- I have to fix my hair first.
- All right, hurry up then.
- Why do you have to go with her?
- I better.
What if somebody should come by... like that deputy sheriff friend of yours the other day?
Yes, that's right.
I'll go tell Aunt Guadalupe.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Doc.
Hurry up!
Open this door here.
Coming.
Hello, Doc.
Glad to see you, Doc!
You'd never know it. I thought
I'd have to break the door down.
It's the rain, Doc.
I couldn't hear a thing, Doc.
You don't need to yell so loud.
I'm not deaf.
Did you ever see such a storm, and it's been going on for four days?
It was lucky for me. The only way
I could shake those bloodhounds.
Washed out all your tracks, huh?
Hungry?
First sit down I've had since I left here.
How's Billy?
Oh, he's fine, sure.
He's been up almost a week now.
Good.
Where's Rio?
So that's what all the yellings about, eh?
- I'll go and call her for you.
- Wait a minute.
You made enough noise now to raise the dead.
So that's it?
All right, where is he?
He's getting dressed.
Maybe I better give him a hand.
No, Doc! Please let me talk to you first!
What got into you? Were you drunk?
What happened to you?
I don't know.
He's a devil.
He did the same to me.
He can charm a bird right out of a bush.
- I never saw it to fail.
- Don't talk that way.
What do you want me to say... bless you, my children?
You might as well.
Huh?
I'm married to him.
You're what?
That's the truth, Doc.
Only please don't tell him.
Tell who?
Billy.
- You mean he doesn't know it?
- No.
Then how could you be married to him?
He was out of his mind.
I never would have done it, only I thought he was gonna die.
And so he would have, if it hadn't been for you.
I don't want his gratitude.
Guess I should've stayed out in the rain with the sheriff.
- Make me a cup of coffee.
- Sure.
It's a good thing you don't want his gratitude.
Why do you say that?
You know, when I come to think of it... after what you done to me,
I couldn't wish you anything better... than you hooking up with Billy.
What do you mean?
I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.
Hello, Doc.
Is that all you got to say to me?
Now look here, Doc, I'm sorry, but it's your own fault.
Oh, my fault, huh?
Who brought me here?
Now you want to switch the blame on me.
First you take my horse, then my girl... and both times it's all my fault.
That reminds me of something else.
You ran away with Red, didn't you?
You think that's any excuse?
It was good enough for me.
- There's only one trouble with it.
- What's that?
The horse was mine too.
I wasn't in much shape to argue that with you, was I?
No, I guess you weren't.
But you didn't have use for that horse lying flat on your back, or did you?
All right, Doc, if that's your way of looking at it.
You just took the loan of him, so to speak.
What are you getting at?
Yes, that's what
I'd like to know.
You borrow from me...
I borrow from you.
What does that mean?
Let's have a cup of java.
We better be getting out of here.
Not at those prices.
All right, Doc,
I'll tell you what I'll do.
What's that?
Well, just to show you my heart's in the right place...
I'll let you take your pick.
Huh?
You mean you'd trade me for a horse?
It's up to Doc. After all, I've got to think of the other fellow, you know.
I appreciate that.
I sure do.
Billy, you don't mean that.
And after all she did for you.
Say, you should have seen what that little horse did for me, huh, Doc?
That's right.
I hope you won't think too hard of me... but under the circumstances...
I'm going to take the horse.
- You are?
- You're not satisfied?
Listen, Doc,
I like that little horse.
What'd I tell you, huh?
- I still can't believe it.
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- What's eating you?
Nothing!
Here. Fill these with fresh water.
The creeks are muddy as all get out.
How about grub?
Can you spare enough flour and bacon to get us to Fort Sumner?
Sure.
Hey, it's clearing up.
We better be getting out of here.
Lend me some dough, will you?
How much do you want?
About 50 bucks.
Here's 40.
Here.
Buy yourself a horse and buggy.
Don't you think it's too much?
You can give Aunt Guadalupe 20 if you want.
If we get located in Fort Sumner,
I'll send for you.
What for?
I can't stand ranch cooking.
Here you are.
- Thanks. Good-bye.
- Bye, Doc.
Bye, lollipop.
Bye, Billy.
Take care of yourself.
You do the same.
Fill these up for Doc.
Hello, you old hay bag.
Have ya missed me?
He's thin as a rail.
He's been getting a little exercise.
Where'd you get that plug?
Wore out the black horse I had, so I traded him to sheep herder for this one.
He's all right.
Little wild yet.
Come on.
Ain't Red a sweetheart?
I'm going to let you have a loan of him for a little while.
- Until you get your strength back.
- You're not gonna do me any favors.
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't wanna be obligated about Red.
- Why not?
- I'm not giving up on getting him back... anymore than I've given up getting on this ornery goat.
Bye, Rio.
- What's the matter?
- Boy, am I tuckered.
- What are you lookin' for?
- A sink of tobacco.
Say, is there anything of mine you don't cotton to?
- I guess I forgot.
- Yeah, it's a bad habit you got.
- What?
- Forgettin' what belongs to others.
- You think I did it on purpose?
- Yes.
- Listen, I don't feel good as it is.
- Neither do I.
You wanna make something out of it?
- That's a big advantage you're taking.
- I can't help it.
I'm so plumb beat out,
I'll be lucky if I can draw 'em clear.
I don't want to crowd a sick man.
I'm all right. Just give me 40 winks and I'll take ya with both hands free.
I guess this is as good a place as any to make camp.
There's no water.
And you won't find any between here and Fort Sumner.
That's a long ways off.
When we get there our friend, the sheriff, won't be far behind.
Huh?
Garrett?
How do you know it's him?
I can tell him farther off than that.
He wouldn't be coming after the two of us alone.
Maybe he's lost too many of his friends.
How come you didn't knock him over?
Or did you try?
- Did I?
- That's what I said. Did ya?
Didn't do nothin' else.
Who do you suppose put him on our trail?
Well, maybe somebody saw us pulling out or...
Or what?
Nothing.
- Sure, she was the one.
- Yeah, Rio.
Why do you suppose she had to up and do a thing like that?
Well, women are funny.
Go easy on that water. We've only got two canteens to get us to Fort Sumner.
What's the matter?
Look!
Sweet spirited miter.
The little darling put sand in it instead of water.
That sure is one for the book.
Well, no use hanging 'round here till morning. Let's get going.
You know, Doc, I think
I'll have another drink.
What are you talking about?
You didn't have one in the first place.
No, but I had the same notion about an hour ago.
I know what you're thinking, but it won't do you any good.
- Take my advice.
- What?
Killing a woman.
- Why not?
- They're all alike.
There isn't anything they wouldn't do for you... or to you.
Hey, why didn't you wake me up?
We should've gotten started long ago.
Keep 'em up!
Hello, Pat.
- Where's Billy?
- Looks like he left ya.
And on my horse, eh?
Try those on.
You know me.
Do I have to put these on?
I know ya.
Put 'em on!
That was pretty smart, putting sand in those canteens.
I had to give you something for your money, didn't I?
Oh, I see.
So you sent the sheriff after us for good measure, huh?
No wonder he came alone.
All he had to do was take his time and wait for the sun to finish us off.
Then how did you get back?
It was pretty tough... but the more I thought about seeing you, darling... the easier it got.
Then what are you waiting for?
Go ahead.
Say, that sounds real nice.
I like to hear you ask for it.
Keep it up.
Beg some more.
What would you like me to say?
Well, you might say "please" very sweetly.
Please.
Will you keep your eyes open?
Yes.
Will you look right at me while I do it?
What is it?
Everybody drinks but me.
I'm supposed to be a camel, huh?
You want a drink, you can climb down and get it.
Say, did you hear something?
- What kind of a track is that?
- I don't know.
Too small for a man.
Here's another one.
Couple over there.
Well, take a look at that.
Yeah, it's an old Indian trick soaking rawhide in water to make it shrink.
Another hour, she'd have been hanging by her wrists.
Well, I'll say one thing for Billy.
He sure does pay off poetic.
He put her right where she could see the water.
He just left here less than half an hour ago.
He went that way, toward those mountains.
- Are you all right? Sit.
- Don't worry about me. Go after him.
- We can't catch him now.
- Why not?
He's got too much of a head start on us. Sit down.
You know, I think he's in love with you.
What are you talking about?
The crazier a man is about a woman, the crazier he thinks and does.
He's only crazy about one thing: Himself.
Say, that gives me a thought.
Maybe we'll get Mr. Billy after all.
- How?
- Just like he says.
If he's crazy enough to do you like this... maybe he's just crazy enough to come back to turn you loose.
You're the one that's crazy.
He doesn't care anything about me.
He'd never come back.
Maybe so, but it's worth trying.
Ain't it, Doc?
If he's fool enough to come back, he oughta get himself caught.
I told you not to breathe so loud.
All right, all right.
Well, how do you like it?
I thought I tied it tighter than that.
- You came back.
- Not on your account, I didn't.
- You didn't?
- You see Doc and the sheriff?
Here we are, Billy, right behind ya.
Now put those hands where they belong.
Say, why didn't you tip me off?
Hurry up with that grub.
I wanna get to town before dark.
- Well, I've only got two hands.
- Why don't you use both of 'em?
- I'll use one on you in a minute.
- I wouldn't put it past ya.
Now's your chance with me all trussed up like a chicken.
Here we are together again.
Same old happy family.
Yeah, and I'd have been halfway to
Fort Sumner if it hadn't been for you.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
Give me a cigarette.
- You mean her.
- Rio! Are you out of your mind?
- Come out and admit it like a man.
- Admit what?
You didn't know Pat caught me until you got back to our camp, did ya?
- Then why come after us?
- Why not?
We'd have been clear to Lincoln before you even got back here.
Say, mister, what are you trying to make out?
I heard you say once you didn't like ranch cooking... so I guess you figured you'd better come back and get Rio.
You're daffy. I wouldn't come back two inches to get her.
- You did.
- I tell you I didn't.
- Actions speak louder than words.
- Do they?
I'll show you how much
I care about her.
If you want her back, you can have her.
Now what do you think about that?
I don't want her.
- Cattle don't graze after sheep.
- Sheep?
Sheep did you say?
I didn't say goats or monkeys.
Why you.
Ah, sit down.
- What's the matter with you?
- None of your business!
Careful, young fella.
You want it now?
I've just been waitin' for an excuse like this.
I'll fix you up.
Never mind fixin' any more food.
We're leavin' now. Come on.
Let me get a drink first.
All right, hurry up.
Hey, Rio, come here and hold my hands so I won't fall in.
Come out of there!
You're all right now.
Come on.
You figure on taking us back to Lincoln, ain't ya?
Where did ya think
I was takin' ya?
- It's over that way, ain't it?
- Sure. What are you gettin' at?
Take a look.
Hey, Doc.
Well, the Mescaleros are out early this year.
They're talkin' about us, ain't they?
Yeah. They're tippin' off another hunting party that must be out.
Right over there.
On both sides of us.
I guess our best chance is to hightail it to Fort Sumner.
Don't figure on me doing much hightailing.
- Why not?
- I ain't no acrobat.
I hope you fellas have sense enough to behave yourselves.
Sure, Pat, certainly.
Sure, Pat.
No, ya don't!
- That's your horse over there.
- Who says so?
I say so.
Get on him and hurry up.
Rio, you ride the paint.
Thanks.
Hey, Red's my horse.
I know he is, but I'm gonna ride him.
I don't like this.
Looks like some of those Mescaleros are ahead of us too.
No, you better not come over here, Rio.
- Why not?
- They put the fire on them.
Those Mescaleros sure do play for keeps.
Say, what's that?
It's a good size party. We'll be knee-deep in them in a minute.
Look over there too.
- Hey, what are ya doin'?
- What do ya think? I want my gun.
Now wait a minute.
You're not gonna argue at a time like this. Aren't you gonna give us a chance?
He'd like to see them put the fire on me.
- I sure would.
- What about her?
We can't talk about it now.
I want to know one thing.
Do I have your solemn promise that you'll give them back when I ask?
- Sure. What do you think we are?
- Will you see to it that he does?
Who's gonna see to it that I do?
I'll take your word for it.
- Where are my cartridges?
- Here you are.
Now what do we do?
Make a stand or run for it?
- Can't make a stand here.
- I know something that might work.
- What is it?
- Come on. Do exactly what I do.
Cut him loose!
I know this place. We're about
40 miles from Fort Sumner.
Senor Garrett, what are you doing out this late?
Hello, Pablo.
Can you put us up for the night?
Sure, glad to have you. Come right in.
My house is yours.
I'll take care of the horses.
Well, boys, I guess we're out of the woods now, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
I wouldn't be too sure of that, Pat.
Oh, yes, he's right, Pat.
Those Mescaleros don't give up so easy.
This is very important.
I want you to ride to Fort Sumner... and give this note to the town marshal.
Did he say "town marshal"?
That's what it sounded like to me.
Thanks, Rio.
It certainly is a beautiful night out.
I think I'll take a little stroll.
And, gentlemen, just in case
I shouldn't return before you retire...
I'll say good night now.
I think I'll go with ya.
Well, Billy, you've been pretty good to my little horse.
I guess the least I can do is let you say good-bye to him.
That's awfully nice of you, Doc.
Oh, I always like to think of the other fella.
So if you just stand right here in this doorway... and don't make no warlike moves... then you can wave farewell to 'im as we ride off.
In other words, you think you're gonna leave.
I'm sorry, Pat, I hate to eat and run, but you know how it is.
- Listen, Doc.
- You're wasting your time, Pat.
Haven't you forgotten something?
No, I don't think so.
Good night all.
Say, Doc.
Yes, what is it?
I'm afraid you'll have to listen to me for a minute.
Why?
What if I don't feel like waving good-bye to Red?
You still think you got something to say about that horse, eh?
Yes, I do.
All right, go ahead and say it.
That's a pretty big advantage to give a man like you.
Didn't you tell me that once?
How's this?
You don't have to go that far.
Thanks.
What about him?
Will he leave us alone?
Or do you think we ought to pull his teeth before we start?
Don't worry about me.
I wouldn't lift a finger, Doc, to keep you from killing him.
You and me never had any trouble till he came along.
He'll keep out of it.
All right, son, I'm waiting.
Put those plates down.
You're makin' me nervous.
- Billy, he'll kill ya.
- What do you care?
- But you can get another horse.
- I want this one.
Why?
I wanna see if I can teach him to make smoke come out of his ears.
Say, I haven't got all night.
Get back against that wall.
- But Billy...
- Go on!
And count up to three.
I won't. You're outta your mind, both of ya.
How about you, Pat?
Sure, I'll be glad to.
You're too willing.
I don't trust you.
I think I'd rather have that cuckoo clock do the counting for me.
Yeah, that's good enough.
It's gonna strike in a minute.
Should we pull on the last cuckoo?
All right.
Well, Billy, I guess this is it.
Men are pretty much like children after all.
Have you ever seen two kids wrestling in the yard?
They push and tussle and maybe they look like they're fighting... but they're not.
They're really friends... and everything's in fun.
Then pretty soon, they play a little too rough... one of 'em gets mad... and in the end, somebody always gets hurt.
So for you and me, this is where somebody gets hurt.
But when it's over... and however it turns out, son... no hard feelings.
Why didn't you draw?
Why did you change your mind?
This some trick of yours?
No, I just don't feel like it.
Maybe I ate too much.
Perhaps some other night you will feel like it, eh?
Who knows?
I never wanted it, but I've waited and let you pick... your own time and place.
You've done that tonight.
You gonna draw, or do I have to make you?
Are you gonna fight... or do you want me to nick your ears?
Doc, have you gone loco?
What's the matter with you, Billy?
I didn't think you'd take this off anybody.
Maybe I wouldn't, off anybody else.
What do you mean by that?
Doc, don't listen to that kind of talk.
Haven't you ever seen cold feet before?
He never had cold feet in his life.
What is it, Billy?
I guess the idea about the cuckoo clock wasn't so good.
Why?
Well, it gave me time to think and remember a few things.
You're the only partner
I ever had.
Gosh, do you really feel that way, son?
- I treated you worse than anyone.
- Nah, it was all my fault.
- Wouldn't want Red carrying both of us.
- Oh, don't worry.
We can find a better way than that to divide 'im up.
Say, you can ride 'im outta here.
No, I had him last.
That's right, come to think of it.
I ain't worried about you and me ever fighting now, Billy... because one thing is certain.
If we didn't do it tonight, we never will.
Come on. Let's go.
So long, Pat.
Don't take any wooden nickels.
You're not going with him.
Look here, you ain't gonna start something with the two of us, are ya?
I might've known you'd do this to me.
Ever since you met him, you've treated me like a dog.
The very first day, you sided with him against me... and made me the laughingstock of the town!
Take it easy.
I gave you your guns so you'd have a chance for your life.
And now you tell me I gotta fight the two of you to get them back.
You stand there, side by side... with that little snip of a kid against me... me, the oldest and best friend you ever had!
And I still would be if it wasn't for him!
Say, mister, that's about enough outta you for one night.
Wait a minute.
You let me handle this.
Pat is a friend of mine.
I don't want to kill him, and
I don't want you to kill him. Clear?
Pat, you're just getting yourself all steamed up.
I'll be seeing you one of these days, and we'll have a good laugh about this.
Now, so long.
Be careful. You know you haven't got a chance against me.
Good-bye.
- Say.
- No, son, please, don't do that.
Oh, Doc, lie down.
Why not?
That's one thing
I've always been afraid of.
- What?
- Dying in bed.
Why didn't you shoot?
You had me beat by a mile.
You had me cold.
Maybe I don't like cold meat.
Well, go ahead.
Go ahead, what?
Aren't you going to say something over Doc?
I don't know what to say.
I never said anything over anybody
I killed before.
I think we oughta say something over Doc.
You better do it.
So long, Doc.
I want you to know I'm sorry.
I honestly am.
Last night I was ready to kill you... but in the daylight,
I can see things much better.
You and Doc have been friends for years.
If I hadn't come between ya, none of this would've happened.
It sure is funny... how two or three trails can cross... and get all tangled up.
Well, go ahead.
After you.
Say, you don't think I'd shoot you in the back, do you?
I don't know, but I ain't gonna tempt ya.
I don't think you'd be fool enough to try to do it from the front.
You never trust anybody, do you?
I apologize, Pat.
Go ahead.
Who's that?
- Where's Pat?
- He's still in the house.
- What's he doin'?
- He's not gonna try to stop you.
- How do you know?
- He told me so.
Say, Billy, can I see you for a minute?
What do you want?
If that's the way ya feel about it, never mind.
At least I'm not afraid to turn my back on you.
Here. Hold these a minute.
I thought you might like to have Doc's guns as a keepsake.
Say, I sure would.
Thanks, Pat.
Thanks a whole lot.
I never had an extra pair.
Black holsters too.
They'd go nice with Sunday clothes, if I ever get any.
Do you think they'll suit ya?
If the barrels ain't too long.
No, they're just the same.
Be careful. They're loaded.
That's right.
I think they're better balanced than mine.
Then how about letting me have yours?
My guns? What for?
If I had your guns...
I could say it was you out there in that grave, instead of Doc.
You'd pass Doc off as me?
Sure.
Everybody would believe me once they saw your six-shooters.
You could leave an end to your trail right here.
Nobody'd follow you up north.
All your troubles would be buried... past and present.
You and Rio could go off with nothing to worry about.
How come you'd do a favor like that for me?
There you go again, Billy.
Distrustin' a person who's tryin' to be decent to you.
Don't you realize that's your whole trouble?
Don't you see that's what's gotten you into all your fights?
You got more enemies than anybody in this part of the country.
How do you expect to get along with people... when you think every man who holds his hand out to you... has a knife behind his back?
Son, l...
I just don't know what's going to become of you.
Honest, I don't.
I didn't mean anything.
I'm sorry.
That's the spirit.
That's my boy.
Now give me those guns and clear out of here, before it's too late.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
But I've had these guns a long time.
I sure hate to let go of 'em.
I've been pretty patient with you.
Billy, my son... it's your duty to give them up.
You owe it to yourself.
You ought to start a new life today.
Those guns are the badge of your shame.
They represent everything you must leave behind you.
Don't you realize that?
Don't you understand... that if you're going to start all over again... your hands must be clean?
I guess you're right, Pat.
I never thought of it like that.
Thanks, Pat.
Billy, you don't know what this means to me.
You'll never forget this day.
Good-bye, Pat.
Why do you say that?
Why shouldn't I?
Why should you?
You ain't goin' anywhere.
I took the firing pins out of those guns.
Why you...
Nothing would make me happier than for you to keep coming.
Is that one of your own guns?
It sure looks like it.
How did you get it?
You dirty little cheat.
You switched those guns on me.
Of all the dirty, rotten tricks...
I didn't mean to, Pat.
Honest, I didn't.
They must've gotten mixed up while I was playin' with 'em.
Thanks.
I left my guns right there.
What for?
Don't you have to show them to everybody to make them believe your story?
You see, I have an idea... that you'd rather give Doc the credit for doing you up like this.
Because I think you'd rather be dead than have people know... that Billy the Kid did this to ya.
Good-bye, Pat.
You don't wanna go off without your canteens, do you?
- Did you fill 'em up for me?
- Yes.
Well, you're not just some pumpkin.
Some son of a country boar.
You're a gentleman.
Remember that when you get to Paris.
A D'Artagnan from Gastonny is as much a gentleman as anybody else.
Maybe more so.
Yes, father.
Now I give you this letter for monsieur De Treville, he is a Gaston.
He's captain of the King's musketeers.
I can't give you anything else.
A little advice.
A few crowns.
A horse.
A horse?
A great black horse?
A horse, yes.
It's not the horse.
It's not the money.
It's that letter to monsieur De Treville.
And remember above all that you are a D'Artagnan.
Your honor is your treasure.
And you are nothing from any man.
I've taught you the sword.
Now alright.
The slightest insult.
The smallest spoke.
My son.
Father.
I shall endure nothing sir from any man!
Bye...
Boy!
My horse.
Boy!
My horse.
You find me amusing?
Perhaps you will find three feet of steel even more amusing.
If you are trying to be as funny as your horse.
You haven't a chance.
I endure no such remarks from any man.
Watch him fender.
Monsieur?
Forgive me My Lady, there will be a short delay, while I dispose of this local fire pot.
Which is more important?
Richelieu's mission or your petty quarrels?
How do you know he's one of the King's spies?
But my Lady, I...
Sir, I await your pleasure.
Must I arrange everything?
Soldier, if he has any papers; destroy them.
Yes, my Lady.
"MUSKETEERS HEADOUARTERS"
Where do I find monsieur De Treville, captain of the King's musketeers?
Inside, up the stairs.
What am I going to do with you?
As a King's musketeer Aramis, you'd make a fine priest.
And you Porthas.
A fine structure to hang pretty clothes on.
With Athos.
Ill captain. Very ill. Mortally ill.
Then recapture me.
What do you want?
A monsieur D'Artagnan.
He has no letter.
Then why are you bothering me?
He's a Gaston sir.
Show him in.
The three of you brawling.
Getting yourself arrested.
By three of Richelieu's guards.
When you weren't even outnumbered.
The King is humiliated.
Forgive me captain, I am late.
You are wounded.
Who told the King we weren't outnumbered?
He was lying.
Tell me who said it and I will cut him...
I will address you, or report the affair to the King.
My apologies, gentlemen.
Dismissed.
Monsieur De Treville.
I ask one favor, my captain.
Let mine be the hand that avenges these men.
I have a bad cough.
These three men happen to be the three best swordsman in Paris.
I think Gaston; they can take care of themselves.
What is it you want?
To be a musketeer.
I admire your spirit, but you have come to me without even a letter.
I had a letter.
It was stolen.
Oh, that swine, if I get my...
Quietly, quietly.
What happened?
Well Sir, it was at Desacres.
A great tall, ugly man with a scar.
Was he alone?
There was a Lady in a carriage.
A very beautiful lady.
Did he speak her name?
No sir, he called her a Lady, but...
Do you know them sir?
She's back.
I beg you. Tell me their name.
I am going to the King.
D'Artagnan, a man is sometimes known by the enemies he makes.
You will receive an appointment to the cadets.
In due time you may perhaps be admitted to the musketeers.
Monsieur!
Captain, my gratitude.
I...
...then tarnish.
Clumsy, big-footed idiot!
You are addressing a future musketeer.
A future musketeer?
If you get the cackle birds out of your hair perhaps.
And the barn yard out of your manners.
I resent that.
Well, I shall give you every opportunity to put your resentment behind the Luxembourg at noon.
Willingly sir.
The duchess gentlemen.
The duchess is swooned by feet.
I'll rapture my cape and...
My cape
A thousand crowns!
How do I get out of here?
By the end of my foot.
I endure no such insult from any man.
Rapture and endure my sword in your belly at the Louvre.
Name the hour.
One.
One.
Well.
What?
You embarrass me.
Aramis, don't tell me there is no Lady in your life?
My life is dedicated to things of the spirit, not of the flesh.
My habit may be that of a musketeer, my habits are not.
You sir!
Who, me?
Yes, you!
Wait!
I was addressing you sir.
What is your hurry?
No, hurry at all sir. Oh, that's better.
Come on, that's enough.
Now tell me.
Do I look like a man who spends his time with the ladies.
Well, if you don't sir, then Paris must sigh with the Ladies sighs.
That's not what I asked.
These gentlemen insist that
I waste my time with the Ladies.
I cannot conceive, sir.
That in the company of a Lady, you would waste a single moment.
Man...
Take your heel, before I take your throat.
Monsieur Aramis, your language.
Would you care to object to my language behind the Louvre at one o'clock?
Yes sir.
Couldn't we make it at two?
Well, you are in good time.
Where are your seconds?
Oh, I have no seconds monsieur Athos.
I only arrived in Paris last night.
What a pity.
To arrive in Paris on one day and to be killed on the next.
Oh, there is no hurry, my second hasn't arrived yet.
With all respect sir.
Would it be proper if we didn't wait?
You see, I have a similar appointment in an hour.
That is, if I survive this one.
No, just as you say.
But don't worry about it, you won't survive.
You know, you're quite a fellow.
Your first day in Paris and two duels.
Three.
I have another one an hour later.
Oh no.
Are these your seconds?
Athos, this is not the man you fight?
Why not?
But I fight him in one hour.
And I am too.
You are too?
What a complete madman!
You know I'm affording a positive affection for you.
You can afford his affection.
You will get him before he is a corps.
Who are you to complain?
Complain!
Now just a minute!
Who found him first?
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, your quarrels are with me, not with each other.
To talk so well and to die so young.
I really do regret this.
Sorry, you're wounded.
You'll find the left hand most confusing.
Come on.
Ready?
Athos! Hussacs
Richelieu's guards.
Five of them.
Leave your swords.
You are under arrest.
Three against five uh?
Four against five.
This gives me great pleasure gentlemen.
Duels are forbidden.
In the name of
Prime Minister Richelieu,
I arrest you.
Do your best in the King's name.
Why don't you use your right hand, Athos?
I save my right hand for my drinking.
Touche!
Be careful. That's Husac
Behind you.
Let him go.
Gentlemen!
No, come watch.
Is this the peasant you were going to fight with your left hand?
Hey!
Hey!
Bravo! Bravo!
Who are you?
Tell Richelieu, the name is D'Artagnan.
You are moderate men.
Which one of you was so vulgar to use a dueler's trousers as a target?
I did sir.
You did that act!
By tomorrow you'll be the talk of Paris.
But you have a great deal to learn.
Richelieu is the King's first minister.
He is an unpopular, but an extremely powerful man.
Richelieu has many ambitions.
Such as war against England.
And most important, the complete destruction of the King's powers.
The King's position is delicate.
We don't want to make it impossible.
Send him back a corps alright.
But don't send him back with his trousers dripping.
Now do you understand?
No, sir.
Captain De Treville.
His majesty the King orders the immediate presence of
Captain De Treville, musketeers
Athos, Aramis and Porthas.
And somebody called D'Artagnan.
Find that brainless cut throat.
Yes, your Majesty.
Obvious imbeciles!
Which is this one?
D'Artagnan, your Majesty.
Well find him some decent clothes.
How can I face Richelieu when my men don't wear decent clothes?
Which of these is the one that so embarrassed me?
D'Artagnan, your Majesty.
Imbecile!
Don't they realize that
Richelieu is my dearest friend and stance defender?
They are too young, Majesty.
Don't they realize that the dignity of my first minister is the dignity of...
They're impetuous men your Majesty
Don't interrupt me when I am talking well.
What did you say?
They're impetuous men your Majesty.
Impetuous imbeciles!
Five hundred francs.
Go on. Go on! Go on away.
And get him some decent clothes.
Wardrobe, a valet, a horse.
All he needs now is a rich widow.
Planchet, my horse.
Gentlemen, my quarters.
Welcome to your quarters
D'Artagnan.
Get that man out of here!
He claims to be your landlord.
He is, monsieur Bonnasieux.
Just as I suspected.
He was telling the truth.
Well, get him out of here.
I can not abide landlords.
Please, just a moment of your time.
I need you sir.
I live below you.
I am going away on a long journey and won't be back for weeks.
I have a goddaughter named Constance.
She is in danger sir.
In danger of what?
Well, she is one of the queen's maids.
I suspect she is been followed by Richelieu's men.
Richelieu's men are notorious for their complete lack of taste.
I believe that.
I beg your pardon sir, but the purposes are, as I suspect, political.
But she is trusted, by the queen.
Well, I beg of you sir.
It won't be a matter of any great inconvenience.
She comes home from the palace only once or twice a week.
You can keep an eye on the street from your windows.
And here.
You can keep an eye on our rooms.
Athos.
That all sounds a little too convenient.
The floorboards, the Goddaughter, the danger
And my young friend has recently distinguished himself as an outstanding defender of the throne.
It smells my dear landlord, of Richelieu.
Now get out of here.
Oh, gentlemen.
Planchet! Remove this man.
I swear to you.
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
He rolls well.
Planchet!
Get me some nails and a hammer.
Maybe I can borrow some from the landlord.
Hey!
Get out!
Oh monsieur, monsieur.
You come from heaven.
No, mademoiselle.
Just from upstairs.
Who ever you are, in the queens name I thank you.
And now please, please, just for an instant.
Alright? Please.
Master, you're wounded.
Mortally, fatally, in the heart.
I shall get a physician.
I shall never recover.
Keep watch man.
I am on the queen's business.
Sorry monsieur, to be in such a hurry.
No greater hurry then I.
I love you.
What?
I love you. I love you.
Oh mademoiselle, inside me is a raging storm.
From the first instant
I behold you.
By the way, what's your name?
Constance.
Constance.
Oh, Constance.
My all.
My all.
My blood rages like a torrent.
My heart beats like a drum.
I come from the end of the earth to employ you.
I thought you said you came from upstairs.
R from you as that is what it takes to be at the end of
You're mad.
No, don't stop.
Lace me off my back while you are talking.
I'm your servant, your subject, your slave.
Your pleasure is my life.
Your will, my law.
My life is yours.
My heart, my sword.
Anything you demand.
My last drop of blood.
Why do I have to style out oasis?
I didn't do very well, did I?
I was only trying to say
I love you.
Maybe you should tell me your name first.
D'Artagnan.
D'Artagnan?
The famous swordsman.
The famous will be.
Oh, no.
I only came from the country a few days ago, I...
I just got these clothes today.
The famous D'Artagnan.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go.
No.
Oh, D'Artagnan.
I am just as simple as you are.
I'm just a girl who works at the palace and...
I am not used to being in love.
I'm late.
Oh, I am late.
Swear on your honor you won't follow me.
But you're not going out of here alone.
Oh trust me.
I beg of you, trust me.
Where are you going?
If you love me, please, please don't follow me.
But I...
You asked me to trust you.
D'Artagnan!
Eave me to keep some cheap rendez-vous on a stree
Stop. Stop.
It's George, the minister of Buckingham,
Prime Minister of England.
Buckingham!
I'm sorry my dear, but the man can not be left in the possession of such knowledge.
It becomes my necessity to kill him.
Oh, your grace.
He is loyal to the queen and besides I...
I love him.
I face Richelieu and all his spies and than I am risking being impaled on a lovers sword?
What a fate for England.
Come.
In here a moment please.
Your Majesty, a messenger from Spain has come with intelligence about your presence.
Her majesty the queen.
Anne, my little Anne.
George. A thousand times you must not come.
A thousand times I shall come.
Why don't you help me?
Why can't you understand?
I understand nothing except that I love you.
But the earth is small and there is no room on it for you and me apart.
Oh, my darling.
Confess to me that you still love me.
Bear your tears in my evidence.
I weep for myself.
For my husband, for my country.
Your country is wise.
But your husband is an idiot.
But Richelieu's spies are everywhere.
In my court, in my bedchamber.
I have no one to trust.
You have me.
I have?
Chelieu's spies discovered you were coming to France even before you left England.
And Countess De Winter?
What intimate circumstances did she discover the se
Anne!
Can't I even trust you?
And I love you.
And I can't help myself.
You accuse me of faithlessness?
No.
I accept it.
George, I love you.
But you must not come here again.
I forbid you ever to come to Paris.
Alone, in disguise, at the mercy of Richelieu's villains.
Richelieu forbids me to come as ambassador.
Then I shall never see you again.
No, if I can not see you as beggar.
If I can not see you as ambassador, then I shall see you as conqueror.
You understand?
Buckingham.
England is mine.
France shall be mine and you shall be mine Anne.
But you must go.
Here.
I give this to you in parting.
We must never meet again.
I shall treasure these like I treasure the dearest recollections of you Anne.
As I treasure the anticipation of our next meeting.
The countess De Winter.
Your Excellency.
Welcome my Lady.
And you were never so welcome as at this moment.
Nor so unwilling to come.
You promised me a holiday.
I am having my holiday.
Oh.
And what is the name of your holiday?
The count De Wardes?
Do you know everything that transpasses in France?
I only know that I am in the midst of a great project.
And that you my Lady, are part of that great project.
I need you my Lady.
Buckingham is in possession of a set of diamond studs.
Twelve studs.
I would be grateful, immensely grateful, if you were to go to England and steal two of them.
Steal two.
What am I, a common thief?
I could hardly trust a common thief with such a mission.
The jewels were presented to Buckingham only last night.
By the queen.
Oh, so he reached the queen.
How comical, despite all your precaution.
I leave the making of excuses to Rosewood.
And his excuses can be quite imaginative.
It is claimed that some lone monster named D'Artagnan annihilated all my men.
Oh no, what a catastrophy!
It takes a good man to prevent a catastrophy my Lady.
And a great man to make use of one.
You and I, my dear are rare creatures in this ancient world of impulsive men.
We have intellect.
We think.
When we think our impulsive enemies are helpless.
The King opposes my plans for war with England.
It is my belief that if Buckingham's relations with the queen can be demonstrated, his Majesty's objection to my plans may be lessened.
But your grace, how can you trust me with such a confidence?
What if I refuse to go to England?
Can there be any one be more trustworthy than an ambitious woman of fashion... with a history?
You said yourself my Lady,
I know everything that transpires or has transpired... in France.
The spies. They're everywhere.
Can you go to England?
To England?
Nobody knows I come to you.
Only the queen.
Oh the poor queen.
Oh Constance.
Richelieu arranged a banquet for the first of the month for the express purpose of displaying the queen's new jewels.
It's a set of twelve diamond studs and he gave them to her for her birthday and she has to wear them.
But I...
But they're in England.
She gave them to Buckingham.
Richelieu has found out and now he wants the King to find out.
And she just has to wear them at the banquet or...
Well, it's only nine days and I don't...
I love you.
Oh...
Oh, you need this letter.
You tell the queen I'll be back with the jewels in nine days time.
What would I do without you?
When I come back...
When you come back...
So this letter must be delivered in England and the jewels returned to Paris by the first of the month?
We have just one advantage.
Richelieu doesn't know we're going.
My friend, my friend.
My young country friend.
When will you learn about Paris?
By now, Richelieu, without the slightest question, knows even the color of your underpants.
Well, it is my obligation, not yours.
If we all went, there'd be a better chance that one of us would survive to return to Paris.
To die among friends.
Can a man ask more?
Can a world offer less?
Who wants to live till the last bottle is empty?
It's all for one D'Artagnan.
And one for all.
On your way
Four against one...
In the queen's name wouldn't you, on your way!
Stay with your master, Porthos. Go!
The town of Becourt lies just beyond there.
I once knew a Lady that lived there.
Some of my most beautiful memories are associated with this road.
D'Artagnan, are you alright?
D'Artagnan, are you alright?
This way, lieutenant.
That was long ago, I tell you.
I hope your Lady still lives in the town.
That was long ago, D'Artagnan!
Long ago!
Separate, men.
We will cut them off.
Here, master!
Husanne.
We meet again, D'Artagnan.
Ride, D'Artagnan, the queen.
Planchet.
A boat for England.
The port was closed last night.
By whose orders?
Richelieu, monsieur.
Our beloved Reginald.
A boat for England.
No boats.
The port is closed.
I am the count De Wardes.
I have special permission for revenue.
You will have to get it signed by the governor of the port.
Where could I find this individual?
The last house on the point.
And such a handsome man he was.
Don't talk like that.
He is not dead.
Well, I'd rather be dead than resemble a seal.
Or maybe I...
Maybe I'd just rather be dead.
What a man.
Hmm.
I said what a man.
Letters from the famous
Countess De Winter.
By the way, Planchet, don't forget.
My name is...
I am the count De Wardes.
The count Du B...
I can not think of no one
I can put my trust in.
The only good thing is that you are not an Englishman.
An Englishman in his grace would probably take this box back to Paris without looking to see what is inside it.
With all respect Sir,
I am a Frenchman.
You skeptic.
Malice.
Malice!
You disgusting thief.
Which one of you stole these jewels?
I will have you hanged from the highest bridge in London.
Oh, your...
Don't lie to me!
No one has been in my room, except...
Summons my jeweler.
This instant!
How many days do you have left?
Five?
Without the one or two stops, sir...
Never mind about that.
If your feet have wings and you roll the wind.
How long does it take to get to Paris?
Three days.
You are alone?
I came to Paris with friends, Sir.
I hope at least one of them is alive and can help me get back.
Rosewood. Draw 100,000 Francs for the Countess De Winter.
Yes, monsieur.
Oh and Rosewood, what about that body of young D'Artagnan?
He is dead.
Excellent.
Then why do you look so unhappy?
Well, five of my men have each assured me he has killed him.
And each of them in five different places.
Place extra guards on every road.
Close the gates of Paris until D'Artagnan's corps is delivered to me here in my palace.
Or his person is lodged in the Bastille.
Yes, monsieur.
Nobody has seen him.
I have every confidence that you, you a man of equal capacities to the King, will someday be equal to a man that is not yet a musketeer.
Hello, D'Artagnan.
Portos!
I thought you were wounded.
I am, I am, but the jewels...
Here, safe.
Ah, that man, that Buckingham.
Two have been stolen and he wants two made in 48 hours.
Well, come on, man.
Take your horse. I need you.
Porthos, when did a wound come between you and a fight?
Well, unfortunately the position of this wound comes between me and my horse.
I give you my word
I was not running away.
I was fighting magnificently when... who should appear?
But no, what a beautiful woman.
I let my eyes stray for just one moment when... zip
I am disgraced.
When was I ever wounded in a locality?
So it was impossible to explain.
Well.
I can see you're in doubt.
No, my dear friend, merely in a hurry.
Where can I find Athos?
In a monastery.
Where?
My friend Athos has renounced the world of the flesh.
But it has only been a few days.
Yes. He says a great deal can happen in a just few days that can change a man's life.
I suspect...
His Lady has great courage in remembering him.
Oh heaven, heaven.
Let Athos still be alive.
I said wine!
I have none.
What kind of idiot...
Why don't you go down in your cellar?
I can't go down there.
Why not?
Merci, gentlemen.
Believe me, there is a madman in my cellar.
A madman.
He took refuge in my cellar a week ago.
He's been down there for a week.
All my food. All my wine.
Three more days like this and I am ruined.
Athos, Athos!
Open up, it's D'Artagnan.
Open up, it's D'Artagnan!
We'll fight dragons with wine...
D'Artagnan.
My friend, welcome!
Welcome.
My beautiful magnificent friend.
Hinault, wine for monsieur D'Artagnan.
The best in the house for my dearest... for monsieur D'Artagnan.
I thought we had to be in Paris tonight.
Here man, I'm drinking.
Please sober up, for heaven's sake.
Ah purity.
His Lady doesn't approve of drink.
Let me tell you about women.
Athos.
I knew a woman once...
Athos!
No. Let's say that
I had a friend.
An aristocratic young friend.
He knew a woman.
Athos, for heaven's sake.
Have you forgotten we are riding to the queen?
I was telling you about women.
Women! Women are the things of your own making!
Have you forgotten our pledge?
All for one and one for all?
You pumpkin, village fool.
You hero.
What do you know of anything besides swordplay?
I was speaking of women?
This friend is aristocratic, a friend.
Fell in love with a country witch.
He married her.
Took her to his ancestral bed.
She was beautiful.
He worshipped her.
He saw her as nature was.
The pure, the good.
His angel of light.
But within a week's time his angel of light had led a neighbor, a young and truthful life of chastity and together they eluded the local church.
My friend run the confession for the woman and turned her over to the executioner.
They branded and shouldered her.
Then they cast her out of his house, renounced his ancestral claims and he fled.
He changed his name and joined the legions of the king.
He never saw the woman again.
But he still loves her.
I am speaking of...
We will ride to Paris.
Move on.
Move on.
Planchet, take the horses inside that barn.
Hold those men.
In richelieu's name,
Stop or I'll fire!
Guards!
Surround that barn!
Get to the loft!
D'Artagnan!
Will you surrender?
I drink too much.
Come on!
Oh my headache!
Come on! Attack the barn.
Seize firing.
D'Artagnan.
If we should meet again.
I believe I was drinking this morning.
I will.
I can tell fairy tales when I drink.
You remember that.
Are we to surrender?
No, we will be here two minutes and you will be free.
The gates of Paris will be open.
Come along, Planchet.
There must be two of us.
They will take you for D'Artagnan.
We will spend the night in the Bastille.
Is Her Majesty never going to appear?
I told you all I know.
She sent word she is not feeling well.
Cystic food?
The supper is almost finished.
Well.
Maybe when the dancing begins.
Dancing.
I have a little gift for her.
When she does appear, Your Majesty,
Without sign of 12 studs that were your gift to her.
Can I ask her who stole these from her?
I am ready now.
But Your Majesty, without the jewels you can't...
D'Artagnan!
The jewels, Madame.
I suspected you might have some need for jewels, Your Majesty.
And so I...
I am heartbroken, Louis.
I had no time to display the jewels properly.
My dressmaker arrived too late.
Your dressmaker,
Madame D'Artagnan no doubt.
But I am all confused.
Where did you get those two studs?
He said they were stolen.
Our great Prime Minister reduced to stealing?
Perhaps we better increase his allowance.
Yes.
You may give them to me just the same.
My profound compliments.
Dispose of them as you will.
Where can we go?
I can't leave the palace tonight.
Tomorrow, somewhere.
My gratitude.
I kissed the queen's hand.
Have you no higher ambitions?
Tomorrow night.
Eight o'clock as the hand sounds.
The end of the flowers.
All the things
I go through for you, master.
No sooner they let me out of the Bastille.
And here I am, wearing your clothes.
I almost prefer the Bastille.
Ah Planchet, we must be careful.
Maybe Richelieu plans revenge.
If we run into an ambush, surely his men must mistake you for me.
Oh yes, that's true.
What are you saying, master!
Hahaah!
You may hang me if you desire.
But call upon you to witness that I surrender freely, voluntarily of my own choice.
Because I cannot stomach the kind of justice that takes the woman and lets the man go free.
The man surpasses even your description of him.
It's unbelievable.
You will release mademoiselle Borassieu.
I bargain with you sir, my life for hers.
Why should I want your life?
You don't want me?
Of course I want you.
I want you as a lieutenant in my guard.
Young man, I can't afford to have you as my enemy.
It's true.
You bring the affairs of state to a complete halt.
But hang you?
What a waste.
Now a man like you D'Artagnan brings out but one thing in me, my inquisitive instinct.
Monsieur, I...
You are an ambitious man or you would not have come to Paris.
May I suggest that in your legions to the throne you have joined your ambitions with a falling style.
Monsieur, I did not come here to pair you.
I came here about a certain young Lady.
Yes.
Why don't we speak of her another time.
Some time perhaps after you have accepted my commission.
The countess De Winter.
Over here, you two haven't met.
The Countess De Winter.
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Or have you met?
I am extremely interested in this young man, my Lady.
I wonder if you would be so good as to entertain him.
Give him a glimpse perhaps of the kind society that will be his.
If he accepts a lieutenancy in my guard.
Athos!
Aramis.
Porthas!
Careful, my friend Albert has a very tender butt.
Aramis, they told me you went to a monastery.
I thought I would not see you again.
It has only been a few days.
A great deal could happen in a few days that can change a man's life.
It seems, my friends, I am prepared to increase the life of the stage.
I expected you at any time to be joining me in the Bastille.
Richelieu took Constance in stead.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Richelieu knows.
Rochefort.
Countess De Winter, I think.
Oh, the famous countess De Winter...
Has anybody actually met her?
Yes, I have been seeing quite a bit of her lately.
Gentlemen. Don't misunderstand me.
I love Constance.
How I love her.
My time with my Lady is spent in polite conversation.
Don't you believe me?
He makes love to one woman in order to make love to another one.
Gentlemen, all I want form my Lady is her confidence.
You don't believe me.
We spoke of horses and gaskets.
The woman most notorious woman in France.
The woman that not even Buckingham could resist.
The most dangerous, fascinating, appetizing, tantalizing.
And all he wants is her confidence.
I only see my Lady to find out where Constance is.
Poor Constance.
Fifty francs he is in love with his Lady by the end of the week.
You swine. He doesn't know what it is to be in love.
When a man is in love he is safe from anything.
You country boy.
You know I almost believe him.
Fifty francs by the end of the week?
I almost believe him, but not fifty francs worth.
You're all poor, corrupt creatures.
Well, you'll see.
She hasn't the slightest appeal for me.
Although if I had some slight appeal for her
I might find out where Constance is.
But my Lady despises me.
She considers me a bore.
Oh, and worse, she is in love with another man.
Desperately.
All she can think of is...
Where is he?
Why doesn't he come to see you?
I have made so little progress.
I have been introduced to her maid.
Don't tell me you are making out with her maid.
Delicious, delicious.
No, no, my relation with Kitty, it's only to intercept her correspondence with this other man.
My God D'Artagnan. How can you be mixed up with so many different women and still be in love with somebody else?
My poor freckled friends.
You'll never understand.
Wait, if all you do care about is Constance, why don't you deliver this other man.
Surely the Countess confides in him.
Excellent, excellent.
Except that the other man unfortunately, is a count De Wardes.
Whom I left in Port Calais in very poor condition with four swords through his body.
How can fate be so cruel!
Cruel faith.
Why don't you kiss me?
Kitty, my precious, my beloved, my all...
Oh, you do not care about me.
All you care about is my mistress.
Well, she doesn't care about you.
This is the man she's in love with.
The count De Wardes.
Oh, I have to take that to him.
I have been taking letters to his house for days now.
He never answers.
Well, of course he doesn't, he is not at his house.
How do you know?
He is a good friend of mine.
Here, let's see what it said.
Oh, give it to me, give it to me.
Oh, I'm not...
My undying love, my...
Oh, you're right, Kitty.
She does love him.
My, my, why don't you answer my letters?
Come to me. I beg...
I wonder...
Could I do it?
I want it! Please!
Give me the letter.
Kitty, this man De Wardes, if she wants to find him, I must.
Oh Kitty, stop squealing,
I'm only trying to help you.
Look, you tell your mistress you delivered the letter.
But I didn't.
Never mind that.
Tell her the count begs forgiveness, but he is in hiding.
He is in trouble with Richelieu.
It was through him that monsieur D'Artagnan got to England and that Richelieu has given out an order for his arrest.
Is this true?
Well, more or less.
More or less.
And then tell your mistress that the Count De Wardes will call on her tonight at midnight.
Well, but on one condition.
That there is no light burning anywhere in the house.
No lights?
Oh, but if he is recognized by one person he is lost.
Tell her that he's afraid of running into the terrible,
D'Artagnan.
Oh I don't understand, I...
I mean... suppose he doesn't come and then she'll be angry with me.
Kitty, don't worry.
Didn't I say he will come; he is a friend of mine.
Yes
But you said he was afraid.
Kitty, my darling, my precious, my darling.
There, there, now run along.
And don't forget
Tonight at midnight.
And no lights!
Every light, Kitty. Hurry.
Yes, my Lady.
Oh, this is insane.
I could just as well pull the drapes, no one could see.
Kitty, did he act insane?
No, my Lady.
Well, never mind. Every light.
If he doesn't come...
If you have made a mistake...
Kitty, the wine is warm from the fire.
Take it. Chill it.
And the chocolate.
It's cold, warm it.
But there is no light in the house.
Do as I say!
Put out the light!
Monsieur D'Artagnan!
Where is my Lady?
In there.
Where is the count De Wardes?
Is the room dark?
There is a fire.
They're eatring by fire light.
A fire? But I said no light.
But it's only a little fire.
You can't see a thing.
You better be right about that.
Why i don't understand.
I don't understand one thing.
Uh. Kitty.
Now go in and announce me as the count De Wardes.
The count...!
Come, come, Kitty.
This is no time for weak nerves.
Go, go, go.
The count De...
The count De Wardes.
Oh Constance, Constance.
Understand me.
This is just for conversational purposes.
De Wardes.
De Wardes, at last.
At last. How sweet to see you.
Supper, how nice.
Never mind about supper.
A man grows hungry, my Lady.
Oh, kiss me. Kiss me.
As part of me is going to be cremated, sitting so close to the fire.
Are you going to kiss me or aren't you?
Well...
Perhaps one little kiss.
I think I'll be wait... better eat supper.
Wake up, Athos.
Athos, wake up.
Oh no.
Come on, Athos, wake up.
And help me to compose a letter.
You wake me up?
It is not even noon yet.
This is no hour for composing letters and looking happy.
Will you stop looking happy?
Oh Athos, we judged her unfairly.
How can I describe her?
Who? Her lips, her throat.
Who? Open your eyes, so you can see who you're talking about.
My Lady.
I can't describe her very well.
It was dark.
She even gave me a ring.
You carnival fellow
I resent your tone, Athos.
You have fallen in love.
I tell you we judged her unfairly.
You know. There is a certain difficulty about this ring.
She gave it to me under the impression that I was De Wardes.
A man wants to be loved for himself and...
And that is why you got to help me to compose some kind of letter.
Give me that ring.
What is it?
What's the matter, Athos?
I don't understand you.
That's a very beautiful ring.
Yes.
It once was mine.
Athos, this is a cruel sort of joke.
There are things that a man doesn't joke about.
I know that ring if I found it in my grave.
It belonged to my family.
It was a wedding gift to my wife.
Your wife?
The countess De Winter.
Poor heaven, how could you play such a hideous trick on me?
How could you play such a trick on me?
On her shoulder, there is a brand.
A floury.
But of course, she wouldn't do that.
Oh, this is monstrous.
What kind of drunken fantasy is this?
My friend, believe me.
This woman is my wife.
I told you the story.
Of your friend.
No, no, of myself, of myself.
I lied.
I despise this woman.
She is evil, selfish.
She is death, she is poison.
You liar.
Why are you trying to turn me against her?
What's your purpose?
The words proclaim your lie.
When you told me the story, you told me you still loved her.
Are these the sentiments of a man who still loves a woman?
Oh you drunken fool.
Because you hate, all women must die?
Are you sure this is the count's real handwriting?
Oh yes, I intercepted that letter only today.
Aramis, you write with a fine hand.
My Lady, I find myself unable to come to you again this evening as promised.
Since my return from England
I have so many invitations of this kind on my hands that I am forced to regulate them a little.
When your turn comes again,
I shall have the honor to inform you of it.
I kiss your hands.
Now sign it De Wardes.
Well, she certainly can't be too fond of De Wardes now.
But Aramis?
What's going to make her fond of me?
You! Get out of my room!
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
He is waiting in the sitting room.
Get him out of the house.
Tell him I can't see...
No. No, wait.
Monsieur D'Artagnan, a famous swordsman.
Kitty, prepare me.
Monsieur D'Artagnan?
How handsome you are.
My Lady, beside you,
I am a sparrow.
Charming.
Oh my Lady.
I am overwhelmed.
I have no words.
It is needless for a man of action to have words.
My, what a strong hand.
It's yours.
Don't you think it is a little bright in here?
The light is still in my eyes.
Oh, if I had you in my arms.
My own arms.
I meant...
Tell me you love me.
If only my heart were free.
Free of anger.
Free of fear.
Fear?
Oh my Lady.
Whom are you afraid of?
What do I live for except your command?
What would you do to a man, who holds my life in bondage?
Who persecutes me?
Who viles me?
Soils my honor in both soul.
Lady.
Speak his name and you sentence him to death.
Count De Wardes.
Who?
Oh.
Oh yes, the count De Wardes.
You're afraid of him.
Well, my Lady.
Well, if you love me.
Well, that is not the question.
Do you love me?
Oh my Lady, to kill a man.
No matter my reputation,
I don't take killing lightly.
Why only yesterday you were cool to me.
Cool to you?
You never know the agony it caused me to sitting here cool.
While you talked about horses.
And I yearning to throw myself into your arms.
Oh, I can't believe this.
And after you had left.
I had to receive this filthy De Wardes.
To pretend that I feel.
My Lady.
Do I love you?
Like the stars at night.
The sun, the day, now, tomorrow, forever.
My heart is yours constantly.
Irrevocably yours.
And yours alone.
Whatever my reputation, monsieur D'Artagnan.
I don't take love lightly.
If I had only known.
Oh my Lady.
I am unworthy of you.
The things I have done and had to do.
It's unworthy of you.
Oh no, my Lady.
Let me put your heart at rest.
It was not the Count De Wardes you hate that came to you last night.
Oh, forgive me.
Forgive me.
I know you will.
Don't you think it's a little bright in here?
My Lady?
Oh, you foul, sickening...
Why will I take so little pleasure in wrestling with women?
I will kill you, kill you.
Why am I a woman?
Why haven't I the strenght?
D'Artagnan, you are destroyed!
Guards! Guards! Please!
Kill him! Kill him!
He does rather well for a farm boy.
So this is how he spends his time in polite conversation.
Shall we intrude?
She has promised to kill you.
She'll keep that promise if she can.
Beware D'Artagnan.
Beware of strange men in dark places.
And lonely roads.
That woman will destroy you because she must.
You know her secret; brand of a common criminal.
Flouris.
All I know is what I have done.
I'm unspeakable.
No.
Merely young.
You could be so much worse off.
She could be your wife.
Constance.
No. Isn't that a miracle?
The queen found me.
Oh my love.
Speak to me.
Darling, we have so little time.
Oh my angel of goodness.
Will you marry me?
Now, this instant.
I can't. There is no time.
Oh, you must.
The queen's carriage, it's coming for me.
She's sending me where
Richelieu can't find me.
I will follow you.
I do not even know where she is sending me.
Oh Constance, Constance.
Why don't we spend the time there is together?
For my sake.
I have to leave soon.
Where I'll be I don't know.
What may happen to you?
We don't know.
You are afraid, aren't you?
You know, you could be killed.
Now you know everything about me.
No, it's just that sometimes I know how young I am and know how much
I have to live for and...
I tremble, I...
I keep making mistakes that follow me through all my days.
The Lady?
If I can figure you, certainly she can.
Oh, you don't know her.
Oh, my darling.
Well, that's only the sun.
Yes?
Your carriage is here.
Where ever you are.
Where ever I am.
Your grace.
Welcome to Grandstone castle, mademoiselle.
You'll be safe here.
Thank you, your grace.
Within a few hours you will be separated from Richelieu by the most impenetrable of all barriers; the wall.
Fire!
Fire!
Attack!
Fire!
D'Artagnan, go back!
Tell His Majesty another road.
We'll hold this one as long as we can.
Come out!
That's no English voice.
We're Frenchman!
Come out, Frenchmen.
Identify yourselves.
Men of the King's musketeers, sir.
What are men of the King's musketeers doing in this vicinity?
Richelieu?
So I am going to have his Majesty on my hands soon.
If I let these men go, the news of this little expedition will reach His Majesty within the hour.
Musketeers.
I find my self abroad this dark night with insufficient escort.
Well, his Majesty has...
We're at your command, sir.
Good.
There is a village yonder with an inn called "Dragon Rouge".
One of you up front, two behind!
My own men will stand guard outside.
Give my trusted friends here a room downstairs with a decent fire.
Gentlemen, you may have my room.
I put in a new stove only this day.
Good.
And landlord, watch their door.
Let them out only in case of trouble.
Monsieur, would you be kind enough to inform me of the reason for the secrecy of this meeting.
It's imperative that no one suspects either that I had anything to do with your leaving.
I have arranged it therefor, that not long after
I go out of this building men will appear and kidnap you by force.
They will know that you are going willingly of course, so I advice you not to resist them.
They will put you on a boat.
By morning you will be in England.
You will then proceed to
Buckingham's headquarters at Grandstone castle, and appear before him.
Well, after the affair with the diamonds.
That's impossible.
It will help that Buckingham knows that at least you're in my complete confidence.
You will present yourself to Buckingham, my Lady, openly.
My negotiater.
My Lady.
Do I understand the great Richelieu is preparing to negotiate a peace?
You do, my Lady.
Buckingham is arranging an alliance with Spain.
With Austria and their reign.
If he is successful, then the days of my power and your affluence are numbered.
But what if he refuses to negotiate?
You disappoint me, my Lady.
We can't play for Gods if that is what he wants.
Of course Buckingham will refuse to negotiate.
Well, but then...
Well, you use your famous imagination.
Are you suggesting that
I have him assassinated?
I suggest nothing.
I merely rely on your imagination.
What are your terms?
I shall need something from you.
Of course.
In writing.
A carte blanche.
A carte blanche?
But you have my word.
In writing.
It is by my orders, for the good of the state.
That there has been some...
Richelieu.
This will be quite satisfactory.
Sst. Listen.
The rest is bargaining.
My terms are simple.
First, there is a certain estate in the vicinity of Lyon.
A barony.
It was renounced by its owner quite some years ago.
It now belongs to the throne.
I want that estate, and the title.
That's easily done, my Lady.
What else?
Second, and last...
I want the head of monsieur D'Artagnan.
Delivered to me preserved in a small box.
Oh no, my Lady.
As of yet I have not yet given up hope for him.
You may give up hope for him now.
His instructions were to let us out in case of trouble.
Nobody said we couldn't start it ourselves.
Quickly, there seems to be trouble!
Athos!
The bargain?
If he succeeds in England, she gets D'Artagnan's head.
No, wait.
You and Portas go back to camp with Richelieu.
Find D'Artagnan, bring him here by morning.
Leave the woman to me.
Tell Richelieu I'm scouting ahead.
What happened?
Where is the other musketeer?
I don't know what happened, monsieur.
Athos went on ahead.
He said he'd scout around.
This man...
I have a message from Richelieu.
All is quiet; you have nothing to fear.
Good.
Don't be afraid, Charlotte,
I can neither kill you nor take you away.
Your kidnappers in a few minutes would report to Richelieu either your corps or your disappearance.
You, my dear wife, thinking it's neither becoming nor believable.
Richelieu gave you a certain paper, a carte blanche.
Since I can not kill you,
I must at least have that paper.
You will give it to me, Charlotte, or I shall have to take it.
No!
Help! Don't hit me!
I'm the landlord.
Help. Help. Help.
What the hell? Stop it!
The Lady you're looking for is upstairs!
Your orders have changed however; she is not to be taken to the boat.
Athos?
Athos?
Water.
You could have at least used wine.
With the compliments and the apologies of the house.
A woman sending apologies to a man who has never appreciated landlords before.
D'Artagnan.
They have told you that?
Yes.
None of us can go to England.
We're soldiers.
If we're caught on English soil, we would be hanged.
I suggest Planchet go to Buckingham.
Planchet?
Hmm?
You're going to England.
Yes, master.
I'll get shot!
Unlikely.
I... get seasick.
Undoubtedly.
D'Artagnan.
Do you think that Planchet is a...
My faith in Planchet is my faith in a friend.
I will go, master.
Well, just so you'll have no difficulty in travelling.
Richelieu himself gives you his blessing.
Be back a week from today.
My friends will be in the French camp, but I may be in hiding.
If you fail, Richelieu may be wanting my head.
Now. Tell Buckingham...
That this same woman, who has been promised my master's head, has come to England, not to assassinate, uh, not to negotiate a peace, but to assassinate you.
Then imprison her, my master said.
This is one of Richelieu's tricks.
Bind her, chain her.
Surround her with guards.
Pick from your most trusted men.
She is evil herself.
Now can I go back to France?
How do I know you're not one of Richelieu's tricks?
Is there anyone in England who can identify you?
No, sir.
I uh...
Well?
Oh. My master says that you will know this.
This man has in his possession the diamond stud that you once stole from me.
But of course, your grace.
That he stole of me.
He was one of my servants.
Where have you been, Duvalle?
I have been trying to find you to have you hanged.
Hanged? Duvalle?
My name is Planchet.
My master is monsieur D'Artagnan.
Would you do me the favor of having this creature hanged?
Planchet.
Oh my sweet Planchet.
How is he?
How is he?
My Lady.
You are under arrest.
Countess De Winter, may I present to you your jailer, mademoiselle Bonnasieux?
You will have a company of guards at your disposal, my dear.
But you will be responsible for this woman.
You see you are a woman yourself and save them all from obvious temptation.
If she escapes you,
You must know that I will be her first victim.
And D'Artagnan, the man you love, the second.
I think you make a better jailer then any man in England.
Remove the prisoner.
I haven't come to the best news.
I haven't come to it yet.
Mademoiselle.
The Lady who lived downstairs.
The Lady you married.
Constance?
She's in England!
You saw her?
Right in the castle!
Oh, and the wit of that monsieur Buckingham.
You know, I had always thought
Englishmen weren't very bright.
Well you see, there was some question about who was to be the woman's jailer.
Never mind about that.
Tell me about my wife.
But that is what I am telling you.
He made the mademoiselle a jailer.
But that is a funny story.
Did I leave something out?
Planchet.
Did he trust the Madame to the mademoiselle herself?
Oh, there was to be soldiers.
He trusted Satan to an angel.
Planchet, saddle my horse.
D'Artagnan, you can't go to
England. You will be hanged.
Stop being overprotective.
You'll be a deserter. In France.
Right! I too then!
They didn't tell me you were sick.
Let me address you.
No.
I will call the surgeon.
No!
I forbid it.
Believe me.
Pray for me. You're young.
You're good.
He will listen to you.
He won't listen to me.
Pray that I die.
Is that what you have been praying for?
To die?
Yes.
I'll call the surgeon.
No! Pray for me, that's all.
Of all you I pray.
Leave me.
Leave me.
Madame, call the surgeon?
She won't let me.
There is nothing wrong with her.
She's just pretending.
She knows that if I call the surgeon, he will find out.
Yes.
It's Alvin of the guard
I brought you your lunch.
Mercy.
Mercy, let me die.
Let the surgeon see you.
Let the surgeon see me?
Let Buckingham know?
He'll hang me.
Tomorrow, today.
But I trust you.
To be hanged.
A common criminal.
An Englishman knew...
Have I ever lied to you?
Have I ever pretended to be anything but what I am?
No.
Your D'Artagnan.
I kill him in an instant.
And Buckingham, that swine, I...
I am who I am.
And I have no concerns with your silly right's and wrong's.
But heaven, heaven may I not have pride?
Must I die at the hand of an Englishman?
I won't tell, I swear.
A knife.
Don't you?
Are you merciful or are you not?
It will save me.
Bring me a knife.
Let me end this.
I don't understand why he is torturing me.
Oh, I can't endure.
Oh, I can't.
Here is home, there is England.
I am mademoiselle Bonnasieux.
I am in charge of a certain person.
I am sick.
I can't take further responsibility.
His grace cannot be disturbed.
Oh, but I must see him.
Tomorrow perhaps.
I will give him the message.
She is laying on the floor.
She's all doubled up like...
Madame,
I take my orders from you.
But you are no officer and I can tell you this:
We don't treat no dog in England like you are treating her.
I am getting the surgeon.
No.
Are there any other guards on duty?
Yes, madame.
Send them away.
But...
You stay by her door.
Close the peephole.
I will be with my Lady in a few minutes.
But I forbid you to watch or have anybody else around.
Yes, Madame.
Will you send for the surgeon?
I don't think that will be necessary.
My Lady.
I... I brought you a book.
Lieutenant St. Clair, returning from France.
I have urgent dispatches for his grace, directly for your lord, the Duke of Buckingham.
I have to report to the captain of the guard.
Follow me sir.
Go! Go!
Guards! Guards!
Follow me!
Frenchmen in the castle!
Fire! Fire! Officers!
You are mademoiselle Bonnasieux.
You came earlier I believe.
His Grace was disturbed by your message and asked that if you returned, you'd been admitted.
Let her go.
Frenchmen in the castle.
Report to your corporal.
Yes sir!
Which way is the prisoner's quarter?
Up the stairs.
His grace has been murdered.
Lord Buckingham has been murdered!
Frenchmen in the castle!
Frenchmen in the castle, follow me, men!
Guards, guards!
Guards!
Guards!
Athos!
Constance. My wife.
My wife.
My Constance.
We will never have time.
Oh yes, my love.
Yes, we have time.
Of course we will have time.
Now look at me.
Look at me.
Keep looking at me.
You and I.
We will have everything you ask for.
Time to be in love.
Hold me.
Oh heaven, let me be strong enough for two of us.
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
We will only have a few seconds and they will come in this room.
We have no Buckingham to protect us now.
D'Artagnan,
You must come there is nothing more you can do.
Listen to me!
De Winter is still alive!
Catch them! Catch them!
I advise you D'Artagnan,
Try to lose yourself on the road to Spain.
Richelieu has given orders for your arrest.
As for the woman, forget her.
You ask the impossible.
This woman has assassinated the Prime Minister of England, murdered D'Artagnan's wife.
What do you propose to do?
Find her.
We lost her somewhere on the road to Lille.
We merely asking you, has she been in Paris?
Athos, this woman is protected by Richelieu.
If you touch her.
Gentlemen, are you aware of what will happen to you?
To all of you?
We are.
Leave her.
I beg of you.
Leave her to the justice of the state.
When there is no justice in the state.
If you come to terms in Paris
The road to Lyon.
Athos, remember the night you said when she was bargaining?
Lyon, an estate near Lyon?
A Barony?
She demanded the estate, and the title.
Is this more or less beautiful than Gastonny,
I wouldn't know.
Here I grew up.
These woods, these hills.
All this was mine.
And more D'Artagnan, more.
Here I fell in love.
Is it she?
Yes.
Well Athos, in a matter of hours, we will be on the road to Spain with a price on our heads.
Will we live to see France again?
Will we live to see Spain?
No!
No!
No!
No!
This was my family's chapel,
Charlotte.
You remember we took our vows here?
I loved you, Charlotte.
I still love you.
I loved you as
I loved war.
I love you as men love all there is, wishful.
Don't kill me, Robert.
Before God and this Holy place
I swear, I swear.
The executioner of Lyon.
Mercy.
You can not... gentlemen.
Mercy.
How many times have you asked for mercy and you received it?
And then repaid it in blood?
How many times have you taken a man's love, their pity, their aspirations?
And their lives?
What has been the essence of your evil?
If you would understood goodness.
We don't forgive you, Charlotte.
We can't.
We do not dare.
My wife.
They should remember you here,
Athos.
I advertise anyway.
Food landlord.
And wine landlord.
In the King's name!
The King's musketeers?
Yes, Monsieur Athos.
The best food and wine for Monsieur Athos.
This is a trap!
Athos! Chandelier!
D'Artagnan!
D'Artagnan!
Athos, hurry!
We have come to a time of peace,
Your Majesty.
The queen has returned from
La Rochelle. The war has ended.
Let the dead be dead and forgiven.
Forgive these men Sire.
I hear their resignations from the musketeers.
Aramis will embrace the life of the spirit.
Portas, I believe he states his intention, or at least his ambition, to marry a rich widow.
D'Artagnan returns to Gastonny.
Athos to the province of his birth.
Grand them peace Sire.
And forgiveness.
It was I who should be forgiven.
I have forgiven treason and arsony and because I admire an honest cutthroat as much as any man.
But with the murder of the Countess De Winter these men have set themselves above the state.
And she assassinated Buckingham.
You know that, and I know it too.
It was a hideous crime, no matter who was responsible.
But I...
I am the state, Your Majesty.
And I say it now privately.
So that we have no need to discuss it in public.
In France I am the state.
These men have set themselves above me.
And it is I, not you who render judgement.
I render their judgement now.
What have you there?
It is by my order and for the good of the state.
That the bearer of this has done what he has done.
Signed Richelieu.
That's a forgery.
This isn't theirs!
I gave this paper to...
To whom, Richelieu?
Did I understand that you were about to render a royal judgement?
In my humble capacity as the throne's
Prime Minister, your Majesty.
I was about to offer my suggestions.
That we allow monsieur Aramis to enter a monastery.
That we discover it possible to find a rich widow formonsieur Portas.
That we restore to the Baron de la Flair, if he wishes them, his land, his title.
And as for monsieur D'Artagnan.
Don't let him go back to Gastonny.
Send him perhaps on a mission of peace to England.
The English lead to dull a life.
Dismissed!
Cheeta!
Cheeta!
I knew where I'd find you.
Couldn't you hear me calling you?
Come on, Tarzan's waiting.
We don't have much time left.
All right, if you don't come right away, we'll leave you behind.
- Are we ready to leave, Tarzan?
- Leave soon.
- That's what you said before.
- Tarzan still say "ready soon."
Maybe Jane will be in Randini before we get there.
Boy glad Jane come home?
I can hardly wait to see her again.
Tarzan feel just like Boy.
But Tarzan work, not talk.
I worked too.
I cleaned up the house as you told me to.
And I watered the garden.
I even put flowers in all the rooms...
...the way Jane likes.
- Boy sweep floor?
Oh, I forgot that.
Well, do it right away.
Hurry, leave soon.
We're leaving now, Cheeta.
All right then, when Jane asks for you...
...I'll tell her you'd rather stay and fish than go and meet her.
So long, Buli.
Cheeta!
Cheeta!
All right then, how big was he this time?
I don't know why, Cheeta, but since you've taken up fishing...
...you've become an awful liar.
Hey, cut it out, Cheeta.
Boy look mad.
Can't a fellow think when he wants to without being interrupted?
Boy think too much.
Forget to laugh.
What Boy think so much about?
Oh, everything.
Everything Jane wrote about in her letters.
Tall buildings.
Trees taller.
Buses and streetcars that take you anywhere you want to go.
Buses never come.
Streetcars always late.
People get mad.
I guess it will take Jane months to tell us...
...all about the wonderful things she's seen.
There they go, Tarzan.
Geese are flying to lake where river starts.
You've never taken me hunting there.
Boy big enough now.
After Jane come back,
Tarzan and Boy go hunting.
Did you hear that, Cheeta?
I got the leader.
Beginners always lucky.
Supposing they've flown away by the time we get back from Randini?
Geese not in hurry like Boy.
- Is she dead?
- Girl be all right.
Where does she come from?
From behind mountains.
Tarzan, you never told me anybody lived there.
Girl not frightened, Tarzan friend.
Panther dead. Others gone.
Cheeta, give bracelet back to Girl.
Why Girl leave Palmyria?
Girl go back to people now.
Ankle hurt?
Tarzan take Girl back.
Oh, no, you mustn't.
Boy and Cheeta wait at raft.
- Can't we come with you, Tarzan?
- No.
- But Tarzan...
- Boy and Cheeta wait at raft.
Tarzan back soon.
I wonder why Tarzan never told us about Palmyria.
Come on, Cheeta.
Look, Cheeta, there's Tarzan.
And I thought I'd seen everything.
No, Cheeta, we'd better get back to the raft.
Throughout the history of our land, our Sun God...
...strangers centering their domain...
...have ever sought to despoil
Palmyrial treasures...
...we dedicate to thy glory.
For the protection of us, thy servants...
...thou hast ordained...
...that all such intruders shall forfeit their lives.
Grant me the strength...
...to carry out...
...this, thy sacred decree.
So Athena has taken it upon herself...
...to defy the wishes of the Sun God.
Forgive me, my queen, I meant no harm.
I grew restless to find out what lay beyond the mountains.
So restless that you forgot...
...that no one is allowed to leave or enter our sacred domain?
Please spare this man's life.
He saved mine.
- I pleaded with him not to come but...
- You need not plead for Tarzan.
He is our friend.
Nor should you seek pardon from me...
...but rather beg forgiveness from the sacred Sun...
...the Snake and the ever-living tree...
...for placing the safety of Palmyria in jeopardy.
Queen make wise laws.
Girl will obey.
May the great Sun God protect you on your way, Tarzan.
It was fortunate indeed...
...that it was Tarzan who found you...
...for he has known the secret of our hidden land...
...and kept it well.
You know, Tarzan, if I had a boy...
...I'd want him to know everything I know.
Tarzan doesn't want to hear any more about Palmyria.
- But, Tarzan, I...
- Boy talk too much.
Boy forget about Palmyria.
What's it say, Splivens?
That there steamer from England docked at Saxford 11 a.m.
Looks like a bit of alright,
Mr. Ballister, don't it?
You know, there might be some whiskey on board.
And there's a party of five coming on the dinghy.
- Who are they?
- Archaeologists, I think.
Archaeologists?
- I'll settle for the whiskey.
- Yes, sir.
What do they think they'll find in this hellhole?
If there's anything to be exploited here,
I'd have done it years ago.
That's right, if there was anything to be exploited around here...
...you would have done it years ago.
Come back here with that mirror.
Cheeta.
Give it to me.
Shame on you, always stealing things.
Hello, Tarzan.
- Thanks.
- Ship come in yet?
Dinghy's bringing the passengers up the river now.
Good. Cheeta stay here.
Boy and Tarzan go meet Jane.
Come, Boy.
One more bend and you'll see Randini.
Glad to be home, Jane, aren't you?
Is this all the speed you can get out of this ocean greyhound?
She's old, ma'am.
She wants to take it easy.
I only hope they got word to Tarzan in time.
Tarzan.
Boy.
My, how you've grown.
Excuse me.
Tarzan, this is Sir Guy Henderson.
- Mr. Anders.
- Glad to know you.
Mr. Brenner.
Mr. Lateur.
And Mr. Basov.
I'm very glad to meet you, Tarzan.
Jane has told us so much about you that I almost feel I know you.
Sir Guy was one of my father's very best friends, Tarzan.
- Jane's friends, Tarzan's friends.
- Thank you.
Oh, I can't get over how big you are.
- And I can swim as well as Tarzan now.
- Really?
Well, almost.
I'll prove it to you.
He swims like a fish.
Nothing is more inaccurate than to compare...
...the aquatic locomotion of a human being with that of a fish.
Hurry up, don't you ever want to get to shore?
Boy, right. Boat slow.
Tarzan and Jane swim to Randini.
But, Tarzan, don't be silly.
I can't swim like this.
No, you don't, no, Tarzan.
Make her get in, Tarzan.
What a family.
No, Tarzan, don't.
Tarzan!
When you told us about Tarzan and Boy,
I thought you were exaggerating.
I'm afraid I'll have to get used to this all over again.
Boy good swimmer. Crocodile better.
Tarzan best swimmer.
There.
Cheeta.
Gentlemen, this is Cheeta.
A magnificent specimen of chimpanzee syndactylous.
The magnificent specimen seems to be allergic...
...to zoologists and taxidermists.
- Hello, Mr. Ballister.
- Welcome home, Jane.
Thank you.
I see you all arrived safely.
What is it, Cheeta? What is it?
Gentlemen, I'm in charge of this post.
Welcome to Randini.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
What have you got there, Cheeta?
Why, thank you, Cheeta.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Gentlemen...
...look at my coming-home present.
Looks like coming home was worthwhile.
Might I?
It's beautiful.
I've seen this design before, somewhere.
The sun, a tree, a snake.
Have you run across anything like this in your travels, Anders?
Wonderful craftsmanship.
No, I haven't.
What does our eminent mineralogist make of it?
Unalloyed gold, unquestionably.
Oh, isn't it lovely?
I wonder where Tarzan got it.
How Jane get this?
Why, Cheeta gave it to me.
- I thought it was from you.
- Cheeta.
Where does the bracelet come from,
Tarzan?
Can it possibly be the work of a native tribe?
- Jane, Tarzan go home now.
- But, Tarzan...
Sun getting low in sky.
Jane come with Tarzan.
I don't understand.
There must be something wrong.
- Don't worry, Jane.
- Jane.
Well, goodbye, gentlemen and good luck.
Goodbye.
Basov, be a good chap and get me the case...
...with the reference books, will you?
- Gladly, sir.
This is it.
"Vase.
Exact origin unknown...
...believed to have originated with an obscure tribe...
...in the interior of Africa.
Composition: Cloisonné and unalloyed gold.
Date unknown.
Owner, British Museum."
The sun, a tree, a snake...
...I knew I'd seen that design before.
The design is identical.
Can you throw any light on this,
Mr. Ballister?
Ever since I took over this post,
I've heard rumors among the natives...
...about a fabulously wealthy tribe led by women.
Yes, but we don't hold with fairytales like that.
You keep your ugly face out of this.
That's right.
I investigated thoroughly...
...strictly in the interest of science of course...
...but these natives are a surly and superstitious lot.
Yes, and that ain't the half of it.
You say these rumors indicate the tribe is led by women?
Amazons.
- Amazons?
- This is too good to miss.
Think of it. Think what it would mean if we were the first to discover this tribe.
Searching for glory, eh?
You wouldn't welcome an opportunity like this?
Naturally, I would.
From a scientist's point of view, the discovery might be of great importance.
Well, then, gentlemen, since we're all agreed.
Not so fast, Mr. Ballister.
This expedition was organized with the specific intention...
...of further investigating certain tribes north of the Kaisoot.
So you're willing to play second fiddle to Young and Goodheart and the others...
...when the chance to make a real discovery falls into our laps.
Well, maybe Sir Guy doesn't like the idea of facing hardships.
Have you any natives around here...
...who could serve as guides if we should make the attempt?
I wouldn't put any trust in the natives.
They're so blinking superstitious.
There's only one man for this job:
Tarzan.
That's right. But will Tarzan tell you?
He'll tell us all right.
How soon can you get this safari in shape?
First thing in the morning.
Then, gentlemen, we better be turning in. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
You won't regret it, Sir Guy, however much you scorn fame.
Pure gold.
Our home.
Trees, bridge.
Every time I wanted to be with you,
I just closed my eyes and there it was.
It's just the way you left it. I cleaned and scrubbed it, didn't I, Tarzan?
Wait until I get my hands on you.
You'll be sorry, every one of you.
Come on, Cheeta.
Look what they've done to my clean house.
Never mind, Boy.
I'll have it fixed up in no time.
Very clever, these monkeys.
Cheeta not nice to little cousin.
- Come, Boy, lots of work.
- Oh, now, never mind, never mind.
You men go out and get the rest of the luggage. This is my job. Go on.
I'm sure glad Jane's back. Now we're gonna have some real cooking again.
Boy always say Tarzan's cooking good.
Well, it wasn't so good sometimes.
Tarzan bad mother, good father.
Tarzan.
I'm all out of breath.
Jane take deep breath and close eyes.
Tarzan thought Jane never come back.
Being away is a lot harder than staying behind.
Very lonely without you.
Or without you.
Jane not angry with Tarzan?
No, Tarzan. Why should I be angry?
Jane seemed unhappy because Tarzan took bracelet away.
No, Tarzan.
You must have a good reason.
It was beautiful and I thought it was my coming-home present.
I was just a little disappointed.
- Was she pretty?
- Who?
The girl you rescued from the panther.
Oh, beautiful.
No, he wasn't quite as tall...
...and his shoulders were a little narrower...
...but he had the nicest smile.
- Who?
- Oh, didn't I tell you?
An officer I met on the boat.
Cheeta been fishing two years, no fish yet.
You can keep your blasted jungle.
Give me Hampstead Heath.
If only 10 percent of what we heard is true, you'll have nothing to kick about.
Well, I hope as how you got your information from headquarters.
I only had room for a few books, so I chose them very carefully.
Jane right, book only as good as what it say.
I like this one best of all.
Strong of arm was Hiawatha
He could shoot ten arrows upward
Shoot them with such strength
And swiftness
That the tenth had left the bowstring
Ere the first to earth had fallen!
Good, good. How Boy learn so quick?
I just read it over a few times.
Anybody could learn it.
You try it, Tarzan.
Swift of foot was Hiawatha
Swift of foot was...
- Swift of foot was...
- Hiawatha
Swift was...
Tarzan mind not so swift.
Even if you can't say it like Hiawatha, you can sure shoot like him.
Forth into the forest straightway
All alone walked Hiawatha
Proudly, with his bow and arrows
And the birds sang round him, o 'er him
"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"
Up the oak tree, close beside him
Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo
In and out among the branches
Coughed and chattered from the oak tree
"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"
But the part I like best of all is where he wants to kill a deer.
The buck comes along...
...and Hiawatha aimed an arrow.
Scarce a twig moved with his motion
Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled
How's about taking a snapshot of me with this here lioness, Mr. Anders?
Why not?
- Could I borrow that gun just a moment?
- Watch it, it's loaded.
This ought to make my old lady sit up and take notice.
This is not my idea of sport,
Mr. Ballister.
Why don't we all sit down and have a good cry?
I didn't do it, Tarzan.
Honestly, I didn't.
It was Ballister what shot it.
She was about to attack.
I think anyone would have done the same thing.
Mother lion never attack unless somebody after cubs.
The only excuse we can offer is it was done in the excitement of the moment.
Oh, Jane.
Every time men bring guns, men bring trouble.
We're sorry, believe me.
I thought you'd planned to go north,
Sir Guy.
Yes, so we had, but something rather exciting cropped up...
...and we changed our plans.
Suppose we talk this over in the morning when things have calmed down.
- Why men not tell why men here?
- What do you mean?
Men come to get Tarzan's help.
It's refreshing to find someone who comes right to the point.
Tarzan answer, like men say, right to the point: No.
Tarzan better take cubs before cubs attack people.
Well, looks like we better set up camp.
All right, boys, start pitching camp.
This change in your plans, Sir Guy...
...in what way could it require
Tarzan's help?
You remember the bracelet you received at Randini?
- Yes.
- A simple gold bracelet.
And it's opened up a world of infinite possibilities.
- What are you doing?
- I'm shooting the sun.
Shooting the sun?
Just an expression, we are trying to find out where we are.
Why? Don't you know where you are?
Hey, what are you doing?
Give me that.
Get out of here! Go on out of here!
Beat it!
Now we'll see how pure it is.
But you can see there's nothing in it.
Boy, look.
Look in here.
It's all full of:
Now you can see why one must be careful.
What you just saw is nothing but harmless, one-cell life.
Jane!
Jane.
You must never drink another drop of water again.
- What?
- You should see what I just saw.
Why, it's full of terrible-looking animals.
He must have looked through
Basov's microscope.
Darling, there are so many things you don't know.
And according to Tarzan's philosophy, what you don't know won't hurt you.
Believe me, Jane, if it were only for self-glory...
...it would be a different matter.
But the discovery of this tribe will be a real contribution to science.
Tarzan is the only man who can lead us there.
You must do everything you can to make him see it our way.
As a rule, it isn't a simple matter to change Tarzan's mind.
He usually has a reason for his actions.
I'm sure I can persuade him to see it your way, Sir Guy.
- Good.
- I'll try too.
Oh, thank you, young man.
- What's wrong?
- Monkey's got a stick of dynamite.
- She'll blow us all sky-high!
- Cheeta!
Here, Cheeta, give it to me, Cheeta.
You nearly had the magnificent specimen ready for your collection this time.
Yes, in small pieces.
- That was a close one.
- You dropped this, Mr. Anders.
- Oh, thank you, Boy.
- How do you work it?
You come around anytime,
I'll be glad to show you.
- I think we better be leaving now, Boy.
- Goodbye.
Jane...
...we're depending on you.
I developed it all by myself.
Then Mr. Anders enlarged it for me.
They've opened up a whole new world for you, haven't they, Boy?
Mr. Anders said I could keep this until they go away.
They're really powerful. Did you see what Mr. Splivens gave Cheeta?
- No.
- A magnifying glass.
Now, what would Cheeta want with a magnifying glass?
Just like he said,
"I hopes as how it'll come in handy."
Look how close it brings the mountains to us.
But that's nothing, you ought to see Mr. Basov's telescope.
It brings the sky right down to the treetops.
Boy know every star in sky like friend.
Yes, Tarzan, but this telescope brings them so close.
- You can almost shake hands with them.
- Almost.
You mustn't try to discourage Boy.
It may be years before anyone comes...
...who can teach him the things these friends of mine can.
Friends help Boy change Tarzan's mind and lead safari.
- Oh, now, that's silly.
- Why men stay here then?
They hope when you understand the object, you'll see reason and help them.
Yesterday Tarzan say no.
Today Tarzan say no.
- Tomorrow Tarzan say no.
- Why won't you help them, Tarzan?
- Not good for men to look into sun.
- What's the sun got to do with it?
Sun like gold.
Too much sun make people blind.
Well, now you're talking in riddles.
If you could just give us one good reason for your refusal.
Jane tell men Tarzan say no.
All right, I'll have to tell Sir Guy that you refuse to change your stubborn mind.
- I'll come with you, Jane.
- I don't think Tarzan would approve.
You might be in danger of learning something.
Boy, soon as men leave,
Tarzan and Boy go hunting.
All right, boys, lay off.
We've gotta break camp.
It's a blooming shame, I told youse what Tarzan wouldn't tell us.
I've had about enough out of you.
I must admit, it is a considerable letdown.
Let me remind you, gentlemen...
...that I have no less interest in this discovery than yourselves.
If anyone can offer a practical solution,
I shall be glad to fall in with it.
There's only one way to deal with a guy like Tarzan.
Well, Sir Guy, I take it you want us to step back into obscurity.
There was nothing obscure about the mission on which we came.
We'll follow our original plan and go north.
Boy, look, jungle water pure.
No bugs.
Boy look like thundercloud. Sick maybe.
Leave him alone, Tarzan. He feels badly because his friends are leaving today.
After safari leave, Boy will forget.
Hope they forget how you treated them.
Maybe Jane gone so long, forget not all men good.
What right have you to judge men who are trying to do something for the world?
You'd hold back the progress of civilization...
...simply because you've decided my friends aren't to be trusted.
Well, I trust them.
If I could think of any way to help them,
I certainly would.
Jane pretty when mad.
Cheeta like Jane, wanna set the world on fire.
Hello.
Hello, Boy.
We've come to say goodbye.
We'll miss you, Boy. I've never had a more promising apprentice.
Men wise to leave.
I like you, Tarzan, but you're as immovable as the Rock of Gibraltar.
It's insufferable to be on the brink of a discovery and to be turned back.
Not all discoveries bring happiness.
Personally, I refuse to be pacified by jungle platitudes.
You must admit, the world will hardly cease to revolve on its axis...
...because of our disappointment.
Get away!
- Well, goodbye, Jane.
- Good luck, Sir Guy.
- Goodbye, Tarzan.
- Goodbye.
Stick to your books, my boy.
He has a fine mind.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Tarangi, Tarangi, on your feet.
Boy, Tarzan keep promise, go hunting now.
I'm not going.
Tarzan wanna see Boy shoot leader of geese.
I don't wanna go.
Boy wanna go before strangers came.
They're not strangers.
They're Jane's friends and mine.
And they're leaving because of you.
I don't ever wanna go hunting with you.
- Tarzan, Boy, what's wrong?
- Tarzan go hunting alone.
Boy, what happened?
Oh, nothing.
Go on home, Cheeta. Leave me alone.
You know, Cheeta, sometimes I can't understand Tarzan.
"Boy forget about Palmyria.
Not good for men to look straight into sun."
Jane's right. Tarzan won't help them.
I will.
Come on, Cheeta.
- Are you sure you know the way, Boy?
- Of course I do.
What puzzles me, Boy, if you knew this all the time, why didn't you speak up?
I didn't realize I was holding back the progress of civilization.
Boy?
Boy.
There. Behind those mountains is Palmyria.
But how does one ever get across?
I know how.
I wonder what's keeping the others so long.
- You wait here. I'll see.
- Thank you, Boy.
Lateur, look.
I stake my reputation...
...that's the orchid Ponsonby claimed to have discovered last year in Brazil.
No, Mr. Lateur, don't step out there!
Don't, those flowers only grow over mud pits.
It's a lucky thing we have Boy to look after us.
Tarangi, Tarangi, what's holding things up?
That's the most cockeyed superstition
I ever heard of.
Who said you won't come back if you go across those mountains?
You'll do as I say.
- That's enough, telling them, governor.
- Pick up that stuff and get out of here.
Pick up that stuff.
Splivens, stop those guys. Stop!
Put that gun away, Ballister.
I'm in charge of this expedition.
Who's going to carry all this stuff?
We'll take only essential equipment.
All I'll need will be my camera and notebooks.
Yeah, only essential equipment.
Boy!
Boy!
Boy!
Paradise in the land of forgotten time.
Get a load of that. Makes your
Hampstead Heath look pretty cheap.
Makes you kind of goosepimply-like all over, don't it?
What was lovely from afar is still lovelier nearby.
- What's eating you?
- Nobody home. A bit eerie, ain't it?
Imagine architecture like this, here in Africa.
Yeah, look at that dome. That's gold.
We are friends.
Our mission is a peaceful one.
Odd form of welcome, huh?
May we greet the ruler of this beautiful land?
You and your companions were ill-advised to come here.
The law of Palmyria demands the penalty of death for all intruders.
We come not as intruders.
But as men of science, anxious to study the ways and the culture of Palmyria.
Are weapons of war implements of study?
We needed these to protect us in the jungle.
But we gladly place our weapons in your keeping until we leave.
Ballister.
You're a fool.
We could have shot our way out of here.
Even if you came with peaceful intent...
...how can we know that you would not spread the word...
...of our treasures to the outside world?
You have only my promise, but I give it sincerely...
...that if we are allowed to leave peacefully...
...no word of what we have seen shall be passed on to a living soul.
Wily old humbug, Sir Guy.
Humbug me eye. He means it.
The path to Palmyria is our most closely guarded secret.
How did you find it?
It's my fault. I led them here.
Who are you?
Boy, son of Tarzan.
Tarzan would never betray us.
Oh, Tarzan doesn't even know that I know the way.
My queen...
...this boy was with Tarzan when he rescued me.
Yes, and I followed them to the top of the mountain.
I have grown old in the service of my people and of the great Sun God.
Never before have I doubted the wisdom of his decrees...
...yet I know that he is not a god of vengeance.
He would not unjustly demand the death of peace-loving men...
...of good faith and an impetuous child.
Your lives will be spared.
It will be difficult not to tell the world of your generosity.
You will not need to suppress your impulse of gratitude.
You will never leave Palmyria.
A place will be found for you among the men who toil in our quarries.
The remainder of your days on Earth...
...will be dedicated to the service of the God...
...who mercifully spared your lives.
See that these men are sheltered in the city for the night.
Jane. Boy.
Jane. Boy.
Tarzan!
Tarzan!
Jane!
Riches enough to buy and sell a continent, and look at us.
Held prisoners by a bunch of women.
Whose habits bear a remarkable resemblance...
...to those of the black widow spider.
- That's right.
And we gave our guns up to them just like that.
Even if we could have shot our way out...
...I have a curious aversion to shooting women.
You may be content to spend your life...
...working for the glory of their almighty
Sun God and his pet snake.
But I love the idea of being handcuffed in a gold mine until we rot to death.
Cheeta, remember the girl
Tarzan rescued?
Go find her, bring her here.
Now it is confirmed that the matriarchal society...
...can and does exist in its purest form.
For heaven's sakes, what's the point of writing when no one's going to read it?
Hampstead Heath was never like this.
- Why did you send for me, Boy?
- You have to help us.
No, no, I mustn't.
I've caused enough trouble already.
- You've got to.
- But I can't.
Tarzan saved your life. The least you can do is to help us get out of here.
Cheeta, come on.
I shall lead you safely past the city.
You must be silent.
Discovery would mean instant death.
- But our weapons...
- They're in the palace.
You'll find them in the room behind the altar.
Get them as quickly as possible.
There's no time to lose.
Oh, wouldn't my old lady love this?
Incredible. The world won't believe me.
They'll believe me all right.
I'm gonna make this trip worthwhile.
Here, give me a hand.
I'm going to see what's keeping them.
Come on, Cheeta.
You greedy fools. Aren't you content to escape with your lives?
Shut up that preaching. Wrap that up.
I didn't bring you here to pillage like barbarians.
Take it easy, Sir Guy.
You'll wake up the whole neighborhood.
I order you to leave everything here.
We're through taking orders from you.
Don't touch that, Ballister.
Have you gone mad?
Sir Guy!
Sir Guy.
Mr. Anders, come quickly.
I should never have brought you here.
You killed him.
Now I know why Tarzan said it was not good for man to look straight at sun.
Stop sniveling. Get in there and help carry some of that stuff.
Get going.
- Pick that up.
- I won't.
Better do as he says.
And be quick about it.
You can go on your feet.
Duck, Mr. Splivens.
We'll never hold them back with one rifle. Looks like our number's up.
Oh, no, it ain't.
Come on. On your feet, chappy.
- I'm all right, go ahead.
- Hurry up, Splivens!
Look out, Mr. Splivens!
Mr. Splivens. Mr. Splivens. Mr. Splivens!
At noon the sun rising over the eastern mountains...
...will fully cover his own image with celestial light.
It is then that you will repay him with your life.
Boy.
- Boy.
- Boy all right. Jane not worry.
Why, it's Cheeta.
Cheeta, where Boy?
Cheeta, stay with Jane.
Now has everlasting evil fallen upon us.
The grass will wither...
...and the shadow of death will cover our fair land.
Never to be lifted until thy sacred symbols are returned to thee.
Anders, this is only the beginning.
I've never seen such wealth.
Now that we know the way, we'll be back.
All of it can be ours.
Pure gold. Look at it.
That means power.
Power to get anything you want.
Where's Boy?
Where's Boy?
Boy!
Tarzan.
Jane! Jane!
Boy!
Oh, darling.
Thank heaven you're both safe.
Throw it, Tarzan. Quick!
Okay, you guys, the Yanks are here.
Don't go! It's a Jap trick!
Come on! You've been here three years!
Get out of here! Head for the main gate.
- Yanks!
- Take him.
Come on, guys!
Come on, fellows, get to the main gate.
Get to the main gate, boys.
Hurry up. Come on, fellows.
Go the main gate, will you?
Come on, the main gate.
Right this way. Come on, boys.
Get over to the main gate.
- Hurry up!
- Get to the main gate, fellows.
Keep the men under cover. Come on.
- Here they come, Captain.
- Hurry.
Come on, men. Hurry it up.
Keep moving, men. Hurry it up.
Come on. Hurry it up.
We'll send a man back as soon as we're in the clear.
- Okay, Captain. We'll take care of them.
- Right.
Come on, give that man a hand, will you?
- That's the first round.
- They'll be back.
- Captain.
- Yeah?
- It's all clear, you can withdraw now.
- Good.
- Jack.
- Yes, sir?
We're pulling out.
Come on.
The men you are about to see...
are actual survivors
of three terrible years...
in the Jap prison camp at Cabanatuan.
For two weeks, Filipino troops have held
their front on Bataan without relief.
And for 10 days and 10 nights, they have
been withstanding the unceasing attacks...
of Gen. Homma 's 200,000 men.
Don't we know it?
Why do you fight? This is not your war.
America brought you into it.
For every American who dies on Bataan,
seven Filipinos shed their blood.
America has abandoned you.
General, what do you think our chances are that...
That help is on its way?
Nothing we can bet on.
What good is liberty to the dead?
Filipinos, why do you fight?
Look toward the sea.
Your liberators come to restore your homes and your loved ones.
Filipinos, look toward the sea.
Scotty, any word on the concentration on our left?
Nothing to indicate one. But there's time for aerial reconnaissance before dark.
Yes, we got time, all right.
But no air corps. It burned out a bearing.
- Get Col. Madden.
- Yes, sir.
Filipinos, why are you rotting in foxholes?
You have no arms.
You're dying by the thousands of malaria.
- Your homes are being destroyed.
- Col. Madden.
- Headquarters on the phone.
- Lay down your guns.
Spare your homeland.
Col. Madden speaking.
They're attacking about every hour, sir, as usual.
Joe, something may be pulled against your end of the line.
Put that company of Philippine Scouts on alert... but don't commit them to action unless the situation becomes desperate.
- What's up, sir?
- I wish I knew, Joe.
- Where's Capt. Bonifacio?
- He went to the cliffs, sir.
- Colonel, sir.
- Yes?
That woman on the radio, she was his sweetheart, sir.
I know.
- Roberts.
- Yes, sir.
I'm going to the cliffs.
I'll be gone 10 minutes.
- Take over.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, Andrés.
- Just passing by, I suppose.
- No, I want to talk to you.
Won't you make yourself at home?
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.
I'm sorry I can't offer anything better than these crude native cigarettes.
That's all right.
I've been smoking them for years.
- Find them to my taste.
- Good.
You'll forgive me if I don't pour you a martini...
- Stop acting like a schoolboy.
- What do you mean schoolboy?
Only a schoolboy would expose himself and his men like you did today.
I know it's tough when the woman you love goes over to the enemy...
- but you can't let...
- It's none of your business.
That's right. But risking the lives of these men is my business.
Keep it up and you'll have the whole company wiped out.
This is a dirty war we're fighting.
We've got to fight it the right way.
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to act like a soldier.
Remember you're in command of a company of men.
You've got the responsibility of their lives in your hands.
What is it, Bernessa?
Maj. McKinley, sir, battalion reports.
Japs are making mass attack, sir.
Get back to your company.
Hold them on the alert.
And don't do anything until you get orders, understand?
Yes, sir.
By the way, for this morning's action,
I'm recommending you for the DSC.
- Colonel, sir.
- Yes, Bernessa?
Capt. Bonifacio, how is it with him?
- Okay. We'll have to keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir.
Get McKinley on the wire.
How much ammunition do they think we've got?
Maj. McKinley speaking.
Madden speaking. What are you guys celebrating down there, New Year's?
- That's real ammunition you're shooting.
- That's real Japs we're shooting at.
At the rate you're going, you'll use up our nine-day supply in two hours.
They're not coming over at the usual rate.
They're coming in waves.
McKinley, there aren't that many Japs.
Sir, I suggest you come down
and see for yourself.
- Take over, Roberts.
- Yes, sir.
I am going to see for myself.
See what I mean, sir?
They're actually bridging that barbed wire with their bodies.
A bridge of dead.
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm all right.
Didn't know there were that many Japs.
- Where's McKinley?
- Second one got him, sir.
Let's get out of here!
- How goes it, Felipe?
- Okay, Colonel.
Filipinos.
This is your countrywoman
Dolici Dalgado speaking to you.
I speak to you from my heart.
Must America have the last drop
of your blood? Lay down your guns.
The empire of Japan is waiting
to welcome you in...
Take it easy! We don't have ammunition to waste on loudspeakers. Get down.
Peace, prosperity, and freedom await you
as soon as this war ends.
You must not fight.
The odds are against you.
... send more men than...
- Hello, Carlito.
- Hello, Colonel.
... preparing for this war for years.
They have not yet been...
- How's the arm?
- Okay, Colonel, sir.
Take care of it.
I'm keeping an eye on your guitar.
Thank you, sir.
The army of Gen. Homma
will join the battle in Bataan.
Filipinos, there is no honor in this fight...
What do they call that DSC you're getting for today's action?
I'll trade you that medal for one shot at the loudspeaker.
No deal. Can't always do what we like.
I've got orders to report to Corregidor.
- What for?
- I don't know.
I'm to turn over my command to Col. Roberts.
- Can I go with you?
- We lost Maj. McKinley today.
You'll take over his battalion.
We must work with them.
We must show
that we are worthy of their help.
We must stop this senseless war at once.
- Hi, Colonel.
- Did the chow get here?
- Yes, sir, Colonel.
- Good.
Andrés...
I know every man in this outfit by his first name.
- I've known them since they were kids.
- Don't worry about them, Colonel.
You have your lives and your honor.
Filipinos, lay down your arms.
- Col. Madden reporting, sir.
- Colonel.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Skinny. It's good to see you.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- We're gonna make fast talk.
- Where's Gen. MacArthur?
How are things going down at your end of the line, Joe?
We could use a little more food.
We're running out of horses and mules, but we'll get by.
Sure you will.
- American.
- The last.
You're building me up for something, Skinny.
- Let's have it.
- You're going out, Joe.
- Where?
- To organize general guerrilla resistance.
And leave my Scouts?
You can't do that to me, Skinny.
I've spent most of my life...
The President just ordered
Gen. MacArthur to Australia.
Well, then, I guess I can leave the Scouts.
I don't have to tell you what the boys of Bataan have gone through.
They've been bothered especially with planes.
They've pinned us down until we're helpless.
We've been combing them out of our hair.
Anything you can do to relieve the pressure.
We'll do the best we can.
- Haven't got much time.
- What about men?
You'll have to take pot luck.
There're a few men in the hills already.
A scattering of scouts and Philippine troops who were cut off.
ROTC boys we couldn't equip, and a few civilians.
Here's a map reference to a small group near the town of Balintawak.
You'll leave by PT boat at midnight.
That doesn't give me time to get back to my men, does it?
No, it doesn't.
- I have my sergeant with me...
- Sure, take him along.
And one thing more.
You have a source of information you'll have to guard at all costs.
- It comes over Radio Manila.
- Radio Manila?
Yes, it's the girl, Dolici Dalgado.
I know the stuff she's broadcast is poison, but it would've gone on the air anyhow.
- She's doing more harm than Jap guns.
- Harm?
It was a tip from her that kept your reserve company of scouts... out of action and saved the whole front.
Last night, she warned us about Yamashita's arrival.
- That'll be good news to a friend of hers.
- Joe... nobody knows about this except you and me... now that Gen. MacArthur's gone.
- It'll have to stop there.
- Yes, sir.
And the way to make contact with her is set out in your orders.
It's vital that the guerrilla movement be organized in case...
You won't have any trouble.
- They're a great people.
- They are, sir.
- So long.
- So long, Skinny.
Be seeing you.
To His Excellency, Gen. Homma, soon to be conqueror of Bataan.
Thank you.
If the Chief of Intelligence can spare his beautiful companion for a moment...
I will talk with her.
I have heard you on the radio,
Miss Dalgado.
I am deeply impressed by your good sense.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
You may be the instrument... of sparing your people much unpleasantness.
- I have worked hard for that end.
- You must continue.
The liberation of the entire Philippines is now merely a matter of days.
- Let us hope so.
- In all confidence, Miss Dalgado... we Japanese look upon you Filipinos... as nephews and nieces.
You have been out of our East Asia family for too long.
We are waiting to embrace you, to welcome you back into the fold... providing you behave yourselves.
- We shall be very good, Your Excellency.
- I'm certain you will.
But remember, we are kindly... but not indulgent.
We shall not hesitate to spank the unruly ones.
Thank you, Miss Dalgado.
The third, or American period of occupation... began with the Battle of Manila Bay... and will be terminated by a grant of independence...
July 4, 1946.
These are the main phases of our history.
What, then, was Spain's contribution to the Philippines?
Maria?
The Spanish brought us the holy faith, the Blessed Virgin, and the saints.
Quite right, Maria.
The Spaniards brought us Christianity.
And, now, what would you say
America gave the Philippines?
- Soda pop.
- Hot dogs!
- Movies.
- Radio.
Baseball!
Perhaps the first of my pupils has a better answer.
Senor Bello.
America taught us that men are free, or they are nothing.
Since then, we have walked with high heads among all men.
Thank you, Senor Bello.
At first, Filipinos did not feel that way.
They resisted the American occupation.
And then what happened? Theresa?
- We were beaten.
- We were not.
Americans cannot beat Filipinos.
My brother, Ramon licked every American in the USA... at 118 pounds.
Facts, Maximo. We must stick to facts.
I seem to recall that Ramon lost his fight for the championship.
We was robbed.
Perhaps, Maximo, I should ask you about a Filipino who was not beaten.
What were the last words of Gen. Del Pilar... to those who left him behind?
"I am..."
"I am surrounded by fearful odds...
"that will overcome me and my gallant men.
"But I am well pleased with the thought...
"that I die fighting for my beloved country.
"Go you into the hills and defend it to the death."
- Is this everybody?
- Yes, sir.
I was told I'd find some Philippine Scouts among you.
Cpl. Cruz, 26th Cavalry,
Philippine Scouts, reporting, sir.
Good, Corporal. Anyone else?
- Where are you men from?
- Mostly from Balintawak, sir.
Ever handle guns?
- Just bolos?
- Our fathers used them well.
How well I know.
I guess you understand we're taking on a job that would be tough for trained men.
We're gonna blow up a gasoline dump on a Japanese airfield...
50 miles the other side of Balintawak.
There will be from 400 to 500 Japs on the field.
- How many?
- 400 or 500.
A mere trifle, like we say.
We'll start tonight after dark.
That ought to put us at the airfield by dark tomorrow night.
Between now and sundown,
Sgt. Bernessa will give you instructions.
Listen to him carefully and do exactly as he says.
- Take over, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Things look rough?
A little rough.
In that case, smell this stew.
Go ahead, smell it.
Ever smell anything better than that in your life?
Never.
In that case, taste it.
Why, it's a masterpiece, Bindle.
You taste there the fruits of two days' panhandling.
All of which goes to prove that nothing is wasted.
People could look at me and say,
"Bindle Jackson, hobo."
But without 20 years' experience on the road, could I make up a mulligan like that?
- Never.
- Now, if I could only shoot.
Colonel, strictly from a point of view of scientific curiosity... what would you say our chances are?
- Of blowing up the dump or getting back?
- Both, especially the latter.
- Fair.
- Fair?
You wouldn't say good?
Not if you want me to tell you what I think.
Very interesting, isn't it?
Not, come to think about it, that I have any seriously pressing engagements.
- Colonel, did you have a good life?
- Fine life, Bindle.
Especially here on the islands.
- And you?
- I can't complain.
You know, that's the worst part about war.
You meet somebody, you get to know them... wham, you never see them again.
You see something, but you never know how it ends.
Be nice to know right now how all this is going to end, wouldn't it?
It certainly would.
You will bow to the Japanese officer as representative of His lmperial Majesty!
Lower!
Fellow Orientals, the hand of His lmperial Majesty, the Emperor... has put an end to your domination... by an exploiting and arrogant
American race.
It will next put an end to a system of education... designed to impress upon you a sense of inferiority.
Senor Bello... step forward, please.
As principal of this school, you will haul down the flag.
Unless you haul down the flag, you will hang in its place.
You contempt...
- For the last time, Senor Bello.
- Senor Bello, haul down the flag.
I speak to you in the name of every man, woman, and child in the United States.
- All right, Bernessa.
- Yes, sir?
- Let's get under way.
- Yes, sir.
Break it up.
He was so little. Not a healthy child.
He hated Americans because his father had fought with Aguinaldo.
It is Miss Barnes.
I gave him an apple.
It was the first he'd ever seen.
And then we became friends.
- Here, lady, you'd better sit down.
- No.
- What happened?
- The Japs came into Balintawak.
He was not a brave man.
He was too terrified even to speak.
But when they ordered him to haul down our flag... he could only shake his head.
And then they hanged him... in the schoolyard, in the presence of his pupils.
It was a bad thing to look at.
I am Miss Barnes, schoolteacher.
- Who are you and what is your rank?
- Col. Madden, ma'am.
Colonel, is it? Then I'm sure you'll know what must be done.
When you attack the village, I want you to attend especially to the Japanese Captain.
- It was he who gave the order.
- We're not attacking the village.
You're an American, are you not?
It was your flag he refused to lower, not his.
The village isn't much out of our way.
Our only chance of getting to the gasoline dump is by surprise.
- Yes, but...
- The moment we'd attack that village... the whole countryside would be on the alert.
I'm thinking of 70,000 men on Bataan.
How do you fellows feel about it?
We think you're right.
Are you proposing to leave this crime unavenged?
We fight for the Philippines, not for revenge.
- Bernessa?
- Yes, sir?
- We're moving out immediately.
- Yes, sir.
You stay here with Miss Barnes.
You'll find food and blankets in the lean-to.
- Take good care of her till we get back.
- Take care of her, indeed.
- Do you think I'd stay here for a moment?
- You can't go back to the village.
Furthermore, young man,
I am not accustomed... to being ordered about by every young popinjay in uniform.
- The men are ready, sir.
- Goodbye, Miss Barnes.
Colonel... you really are not returning to the village?
Really not.
Then I shall give you
Buenaventura Bello's epitaph.
Someday you may come back into the village of Balintawak again... and put it over his grave.
"The place matters not- cypress or laurel or lily white
"Scaffold or open plain
"combat or martyrdom's plight"
Those words were written by José Rizal, the Philippines' greatest hero... on the night before he was executed by the Spaniards.
Remember those words.
Carry them in your heart... so that wherever men fight for freedom, there it may be said:
"Here lies Buenaventura Bello...
"schoolteacher of Balintawak."
- Colonel?
- Yes?
What would you think our chances are now?
- Good.
- Funny thing. So would I.
Hold it up. There's Mt. Mariveles ahead.
We ought to be about two hours from the airfield.
We better split up. Check your watch.
- That is Mt. Mariveles, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
We should be hearing gunfire from Bataan.
Yes, sir.
- Cruz?
- Yes, sir.
Hold this group here, and keep them under cover.
Bring along four men.
We'll take a look-see.
Scouts.
Give me a hand.
- Bernessa.
- Yes, sir?
- Post some guards.
- Yes, sir.
- What happened?
- Bataan has fallen.
Seventy thousand men.
How could it happen?
- We're beaten.
- The Japs have beaten us.
Hunger and sickness beat us, not the Japs.
Then why didn't America send food and medicine? Why didn't America help?
Maybe you can still get away, sir.
There is no more army here.
Now the fighting will be done in Australia.
Maybe there will be fighting here.
- Maybe the people will wanna fight.
- Sure. The people will fight.
Against thousands of Japs, after they've beaten our armies?
We have fought that way before.
We've never been conquered.
With bolos against machine guns?
If a schoolteacher can die for the American flag... we can fight for the Philippines.
We must have a hope.
We cannot die for nothing.
You remember the name
Andrés Bonifacio?
Every Filipino does.
If he were alive and sent out a call, would the people answer?
- Bonifacio's dead.
- But his grandson is alive... among those prisoners.
Maybe we'll be able to find him, sir.
For you, Captain.
- All right, set him down.
- Don't. Take him into the lean-to.
Put him down carefully.
He's a very sick man.
Which one of you men calls himself the cook?
- Me.
- I shall want some hot water first.
Then some clear broth.
Do you know how to make it?
Don't pretend you do if you don't.
Good. Hurry off.
Maximo, get these men some water.
- Can't you see they're thirsty?
- Yes, ma'am.
Cook, that's a petticoat you're gaping at.
You've seen a petticoat before.
- Yes, but not lately.
- Hurry with the broth.
- Who is he?
- He's the grandson of Andrés Bonifacio.
No wonder you carried him so carefully.
Those men are waiting for you.
- Where are you from?
- From the north. Lingayen.
- I've come to fight.
- We come from Batangas.
- We've come to fight, too.
- Good. Plenty of fighting to be done.
- Do you bring any news?
- They say the Japs have taken Bataan.
- I know. How about Corregidor?
- They don't say about Corregidor.
You men can do the most good if you go back to your barrios... and tell them that the war hasn't ended yet.
And now the people must fight.
We need men.
We have no arms.
- Where did you get this?
- Killed a Jap.
Kill more Japs and get more guns.
When you have men and arms, send your leaders to me.
You'll know where we are.
Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Be careful.
We'll drive all the Japs out.
We'll chase them out of Balintawak.
Sure you will, Maximo.
Hurry to the village and try to find eggs.
Don't forget those papers. Hurry now.
You know what this will mean for the people? Reprisals and terror.
It's always been an all-out war.
Now there's no pretense about it.
You can't inflict this on them.
They've suffered too much.
I'm gonna make arrangements for you to leave the island.
Leave? You can't ask me to leave.
My children are here, my work.
Do you know what they do to guerrillas?
If Filipino women can endure it, I can.
- No, I'm afraid...
- Besides... you need someone to nurse him.
At least until he's better.
We'll see.
- You spoke of an epitaph for Senor Bello.
- Yes, I did.
Get it ready.
We're going into Balintawak tonight.
Col. Roberts?
Last time I saw him he was still alive.
How about Delfonso?
He was in pretty bad shape.
He's still going.
There was a rumor about taking our entire outfit to the same prison camp.
- You haven't eaten a thing.
- Sorry, ma'am, I'm not hungry.
You can't get your strength back if you don't eat something.
Here's some real chicken broth.
If you knew the trouble we went...
Sorry, ma'am.
I don't know what I'm going to do with him.
- Have you seen Maximo?
- He hasn't come back yet.
I can't imagine what's happened to him.
And José Lopez and Tomas Rinaldo, they left for Balintawak yesterday.
And they haven't come back yet.
He just won't eat. I don't understand it.
He's been through a pretty rough experience.
Yes, but his pulse is normal, his eyes are clear. What is his trouble?
- Among other things, a woman.
- A woman?
This certainly is not the time for that sort of thing.
- He's got to get her out of his mind.
- Sometimes it isn't that easy.
So we spend the winter in Palm Beach.
- Doing what?
- Taking it easy.
- Have either of you seen Maximo?
- No, ma'am.
- Or José Lopez, or Tomas Rinaldo?
- No, ma'am.
Let's see. Now where were we?
Taking it easy in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S.A.
Yes. So we spend the winter in Florida.
Then we hop a train, a streamliner, mind you. Nothing but the best for us.
- We still don't buy any ticket for this train?
- Who buys tickets?
We hop off at New York in time for the opening ball game...
- we crash a few shows.
- Say, Joe...
- Yes?
...when do we work?
- Never.
- I sure am going to like the USA.
Say, where you been?
Picklepuss has been looking for you.
Okay.
I know a place in New York where they make hot dogs a foot long.
- A whole foot long?
- Yeah.
- With relish and mustard?
- The works.
Maybe you're wondering at this point how we get money to pay for these.
There's ways and means of getting money without working. Strictly legal, mind you.
Where have you been?
The idea of a grown man talking like that before these boys.
- What have you there?
- A radio.
Radio?
Colonel, look, a radio.
- Where'd you pick it up, in Balintawak?
- No, I stole it from the Japs.
... then every man, woman, and child
in the district will be wiped out.
Filipinos, do not resist.
For every Japanese life,
we pay with 10 Filipino lives.
Sixty Filipinos were executed today.
I now read a list of the names...
of those who paid with their lives
for the recent disorders.
In Balintawak, for the murder
of four Japanese officers...
40 Filipinos were executed.
Forty men.
Tomas Rinaldo, age 28.
Felipe Luiz, age 16.
Juan Dios, age 30.
Pablo Quincaro, age 19.
- Ramon Cuenca, age 35...
- That's my father.
They killed my father!
The war hurts everybody.
Rest a while, and then we'll send you back to Balintawak.
Your mother'll need you.
But I'm coming back. You said I could.
Sure, Maximo.
... submarines have been reported
in the Gulf of Mexico...
where they sank two American vessels.
In Burma, British-Chinese forces
continue to withdraw...
up the Irrawaddy river towards Bhamo.
Last night, after six days of
ceaseless cannonading by the Japanese...
the fortress of Corregidor in Manila Bay...
and satellite forts,
Hughes, Drum, and Frank...
were surrendered at 11 p.m.
by Lt. Gen. Jonathan Wainwright.
- The news is a little tough.
- Tough?
We're licked, Joe.
Licked? When is a nation licked?
Military textbooks say a war is over when the objectives are taken.
The United States fought your grandfather.
- We found the textbooks were wrong.
- Were they?
You fought off the Spaniards for over 300 years...
Then the American came.
And a handful of revolutionaries, calling themselves the Katipunan... took everything we could throw at them.
Fought us to a standstill with bolos and clubs.
Now the Jap is here.
What would've happened if we hadn't fought the Spaniard... if my grandfather hadn't called out the Katipunan?
- You'd be slaves.
- What are we now?
I've been doing a lot of thinking these last few days.
I wondered why you saved me out of all those thousands of prisoners.
- You picked the wrong guy.
- I picked Andrés Bonifacio.
I know you did. Now you expect him to spread the word that Bonifacio's back.
To arms, Filipinos.
Remember the Katipunan.
Kill the Japs, even if it means you'll be killed 10-to-1, 20-for-1.
When there are no more men, then women and children, uselessly.
- Uselessly?
- You know that alone we're helpless.
Where are all those American warships we were promised?
Where are those American guns and planes?
Why didn't they come to Bataan and Corregidor?
I don't know.
- Can you promise they'll come back?
- I can't.
Now you want me to urge them on to more slaughter!
It's easy for you. They're not your people.
I don't mean that, Joe.
I know you're a better Filipino than I am.
Maybe you should've left me prisoner.
It's just that we've taken too much these last few months.
Sure.
A guy can only take so much, then he loses something.
I know.
I've seen too much.
We really don't know whether the Americans are coming back or not.
A guy's got to have something he wants to live for before he can ask others to die.
Sure.
After a while you lose something.
Do you feel strong enough to go to Manila?
- Trying to get rid of me?
- Yes. You don't belong here.
I'm willing to fight.
In this kind of war, you got to believe in what you're fighting for.
Maybe if you go to Manila, you'll find something...
- that'll change your mind. Will you go?
- Sure.
I want to get a message through.
I've got a contact there.
We'll get you a monk's robe.
You'll go to the chapter house of the Dominicans. Ask for the prior.
Tell him you want to hear a confession.
...to intercede for the soul of Andrés Bonifacio... who has passed from this world.
May he be set in a region of peace and light... through our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ. Amen.
You have come from the prior?
- Andrés.
- Dolici?
Is it Dolici?
I thought you were dead.
Andrés, they are watching us.
- Be careful.
- I must look at you.
Don't.
There must be some place we can talk and see each other.
- Dolici, you haven't gone?
- No. I'm trying to think.
There's a little park behind the church.
Wait a few moments after I'm gone.
I'll meet you there.
- Dolici.
- Darling.
We have only a few moments together, and I'm crying.
You haven't changed a bit.
You're just as I remembered you a thousand times.
I can't tell you how much
I wanted this moment.
How I wanted to hold you...
Is there someplace we can be alone?
Where? They cast a long shadow.
I don't care.
I can't leave you now that I've found you.
What good can we do now?
Maybe the Americans will come back someday.
I'll come back with them then.
No. We're not waiting for anyone to come back.
We don't want freedom as a gift.
We want it as a right to something we've fought and died for.
- I'll kill him if he comes back.
- I've got to go now.
You're throwing away our happiness.
Come away with me.
- Are you with Madden?
- Yes, we're on Balintawak.
When can I see you again?
When can I come back?
Don't come back here ever.
Maybe I'll be able to come to you.
We must fight, Andrés.
- So you came back?
- Yeah. I saw Dolici.
- Good.
- You've known about her for some time?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Didn't you think I'd like to know the woman I love was not a traitor?
- I was under orders.
- Orders?
Yes, orders that might affect every American and Filipino on the island.
Don't talk to me about the Filipinos.
Mention freedom around them and they don't stop to think.
They walk empty-handed into blazing machine-gun fire.
But you and I should know better.
We should stop to think if we've got a million-to-one chance.
But no. You and Dolici have gone out of your heads.
Okay, we're crazy.
We and 17 million Filipinos.
- What'd you come back here for?
- Because I'm crazy, too.
I wanna keep on fighting Japs, even though I know it's completely mad.
Don't get me wrong.
No one's gonna use my name... to encourage people to kill themselves faster than the Japs are doing it.
I'll stick around and fight, only until Dolici decides to joins me.
After that, we're getting out of here as fast as we can.
All right, if that's the way you feel about it.
We'll do the best we can without you.
But just between us lunatics,
I think we'll win.
But what is being done?
Your Excellency, we cannot find the enemy.
We send 100 men out, and they see nothing.
We send 10 men, and they don't come back.
We have set up severe reprisals,
Your Excellency.
Reprisals.
Your Excellency, you must let me resign.
A dead man cannot serve the Japanese, no matter how hard he tried.
Look, they came into my bedroom while I was asleep.
They painted this on my pillow.
Right next to my throat.
This is a sign of war.
This is my death warrant.
You're in no danger.
We'll provide sentries.
I'm the Chief of Police.
I had four sentries there all night.
- You're under our protection.
- Protection?
Did you protect the Mayor of Legaspi, or the Commissioner of Malolos, or...
Six whole divisions at your disposal... and you couldn't even protect our friends.
All you could think about was reprisals.
Send in Miss Dalgado.
You have my personal guarantee of safety.
You may go.
Yes, thank you, Your Excellency.
They might have just as easily slit my throat.
Miss Dalgado, tell Col. Coroki... why we have failed to win the Filipino people over.
I was not aware that...
The guerrillas obviously have the complete aid and sympathy of the people.
We are interested only in a frank answer.
There's no advantage in cooperating with the Japanese.
A man obeys all the Japanese laws.
When he's taken at random and shot... his next-door neighbor will think,
"It does a man no good to obey."
He might as well die fighting.
You're a conquered people.
What do you expect, independence?
That's not a bad idea, Coroki.
Miss Dalgado,
Tokyo has graciously consented... to grant full independence to its little nephews and nieces.
Now your people will see the advantage of cooperating with us.
Why, we will be able to hold these islands with only two divisions.
The granting of independence must be an impressive occasion.
- You will help us, Miss Dalgado?
- It will be a great honor, Your Excellency.
Perhaps it would be a good idea to hold the ceremonies at Balintawak.
It's the birthplace of Philippine independence.
An intelligent suggestion.
The arrangements will be left in Col. Coroki's hands.
To avoid any possible interference with the ceremony...
I suggest you keep the place secret.
We wish to make that a memorable occasion, Colonel.
It will be a most memorable occasion,
Your Excellency.
Yes. Make it memorable, Colonel.
Most memorable.
You can find room for this.
- Captain, everything's okay in Balintawak.
- What did you tell them?
- What you told me to say.
- Tell me exactly what you said.
I told them nobody was to do anything that might tip the Japs off.
Everybody's supposed to do their business, do what the Japs said... and when the shooting started, everybody should scram.
You told them the Japs have promised us full independence?
- What did they say?
- Nothing.
Bernessa, get the drums going.
Get all the men together.
- Pvt. Cuenca?
- Yes, sir?
You accomplished your mission. I think he deserves a red star, Miss Barnes.
Red star, indeed.
In his last composition, he spelled
"liberty" with a "U" instead of an "E."
Say, Colonel, it will only take one informer to tip this whole deal off to the Japs.
That's right.
- What of it?
- Nothing. Just thinking out loud, I guess.
I don't know what I'm standing around for with so much to be done.
Maximo, I've outlined a course of study for the children.
You tell them they must keep up on their studies now.
They must brush their teeth twice a day.
Tell them to eat lots of greens if they can get them.
I'm leaving with Col. Madden.
- But I'm going along.
- That's out of the question.
Besides, you must take charge of the children.
But he promised me.
He said I could be a scout.
Yes, I did, and I have been meaning to speak...
You've done altogether too much playing at war for your age. I think...
- I'm going to be a scout.
- Maximo, you mustn't...
If you don't mind, Colonel,
Maximo is still my pupil.
Now, you get that nonsense out of your head.
- I'll get the outline.
- I'm not going back.
Maximo, if you insist on this stubbornness...
I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave without saying goodbye.
I'm going with you.
Maximo, come here.
Sit down.
Miss Barnes loves you very much.
I know. I'm sorry, but I want to go.
You can't. After tomorrow, the Japs will be chasing us night and day.
We're going to have to move fast.
We'll be sleeping in swamps.
There'll be days without food.
Sounds okay to me.
But you're much too important for us to risk.
You're the guy we're fighting this war for.
I'd rather be a Scout.
This thing isn't going to last forever.
And after it's over... you're going to have to be the one to build and plan.
You'll help make the Philippines a great nation.
You did promise me.
You even called me "Pvt. Cuenca."
All right.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll make you a full colonel.
The first thing an officer has to learn is to take orders and obey them to the letter.
Remember what Miss Barnes said.
Take charge of those kids and make sure they keep up on their studies.
Stay out of trouble. Got it?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, Colonel.
- I'll be seeing you.
- Yes, sir.
In a few moments, we will be on the air.
In the meantime, here are the instructions
for those gathered in this park.
You are enjoined to obey strictly
the following regulations.
One: Do not show any flag
but the Japanese flag.
Two: At the appropriate times
you will shout "banzai"...
Ioudly, and with enthusiasm, three times.
Three: Do not make
any suspicious movement.
We are about to broadcast.
There will be a complete silence
unless otherwise indicated.
People of the Philippines...
we are broadcasting from Balintawak,
the birthplace of Filipino freedom.
Seventeen million Filipinos are gathered
around their radios all over the islands...
at the invitation of
the Japanese government.
Today the seeds of Filipino
and Japanese friendship flower and bloom.
This day will live forever
in the memory of every true Filipino.
People of the Philippines,
we now bring to you...
His lmperial Highness, Prince lto.
Banzai!
The Filipino nation will be included...
in the Greater East Asia,
Co-Prosperity Sphere.
Therefore, by virtue of the authority...
of His lmperial Majesty,
the Emperor of Japan...
I hereby proclaim to the world...
the full and complete independence
of the Republic of the Philippines.
Banzai!
There is lavish cheering
from the people of Balintawak.
His lmperial Highness,
Prince lto, has retired.
Miss Dolici Dalgado's
crossing the platform...
and will now raise the first flag
of the new Philippine Republic.
The guard of honor will fire a volley
to commemorate this historic event.
Take cover!
Follow me!
This is Dolici Dalgado speaking to you.
For the first time
I'm able to speak the truth.
The Japanese have offered us
what they call independence.
Let this be our answer.
Take cover!
Fire at the radio. Destroy it!
Cover Bonifacio.
Resist the Jap invader. Head for the hills.
Let's get out of here.
Cease firing!
Lieutenant, assemble the men, round up the civilians.
This is what we get for granting them independence.
I told Homma this gesture was foolish.
This is no way to handle Filipinos.
I knew the girl wasn't to be trusted.
From now on, we'll smash them before they resist. Get out after them.
Where do you suggest I look?
Anywhere. But find them, especially the girl.
I want them hounded until every one of them is brought back to me.
Let me go.
Your Excellency, I saw this boy direct a crowd off the field.
I caught him as he was trying to run away.
Where did you get this?
Where are their headquarters? Talk!
Where did they go?
Don't.
I'll show you.
- I'll show you where they went.
- All right.
- You know what I've been thinking?
- What?
Wouldn't it be nice if we were on that road above... and had a bunch of Japs caught down here?
It sure would.
We could pick them off like ducks in a shooting gallery.
We'd murder them.
Hold it up.
Here. Catch your breath.
We could come down that road and catch the Japs like rats in a trap.
They wouldn't have a chance.
I'm all right.
Come on, honey.
There they are.
Stop at the head of the canyon.
- I know what you're thinking.
- You do? How come?
I'm psychic.
What's that?
Take cover!
Boy, could we murder them.
Stop it!
Maximo.
I won't tell.
- I won't tell.
- It's Miss Barnes, Maximo.
- They didn't get you, did they?
- No, dear, they didn't.
They took my eagle away.
- Miss Barnes.
- Yes, dear?
I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye.
I'm sorry I didn't learn to spell "liberty."
Dear God.
Who ever learned it so well.
Col. Madden,
Australia has been trying to get you, sir.
- Where have you got your radio set up?
- This way, sir.
About two weeks, sir.
I think a razor, sir.
Thank you.
Bernessa, we're going on ahead.
We're going to have to leave you.
I got word from headquarters.
- We're going with you, aren't we?
- No. We have to move fast.
You'd better break up into small groups and head for this spot in northern Leyte.
American submarines have been putting in there.
- What's up, Joe?
- I don't know yet. Maybe something big.
- Well, good luck.
- Goodbye, Colonel.
So long, Colonel.
- Joe.
- Yes?
Good luck.
Thanks, Andrés.
I'll be seeing you.
- Bernessa.
- Santo.
- Pepe. Captain.
- Bernessa, how are you?
- We had word you were coming.
- Where is Col. Madden?
Headquarters sent for him.
They took him to Australia.
But I think he'll be back soon.
There's a camp up ahead.
It's not very far. Come on, let's go.
Thank you, Bernessa.
Glad to see you. I'm Capt. Bonifacio.
Welcome, Captain. We're glad to see you.
- What are these people doing here?
- They're waiting for the submarine.
There are thousands more with their families all over this area.
These people look like they're starving.
Why don't you break up and spread over the countryside?
We must stay together. Rumor is, this is where the action will take place.
You'd risk all these lives on a rumor?
The rumors we hear are true.
How long have you been waiting for this submarine?
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks?
How much food do you think a submarine can bring, if it comes?
Not much food maybe, but many guns.
- Have you had any word?
- Not yet.
We've been sending two men out in a boat.
They fly an American flag and wait.
Maybe a submarine will see them.
What if a Jap plane sees them?
Then we send two other men.
Why are you puzzled?
Aren't you a Filipino?
Whose idea was it to volunteer for this job?
Yours.
I must have been delirious for lack of food.
Maybe I'll dream me up a nice steak.
Dream me one, too.
- How would you like it?
- Medium rare.
Coming up.
Submarine!
Andrés.
Capt. Bonifacio.
- Hello, Andrés.
- Hiya, Joe. You look naked.
You're all set.
You're going out.
I'm not leaving, Joe.
I belong here.
This is Comdr. Waite of the United States Navy.
He has good news for you.
I heard so much about what you're doing here...
I finally persuaded headquarters to let me take on this mission... so I could see for myself.
I really don't deserve to be the one to bring you this news... but I'm proud that I am.
Two and a half years ago, we promised the Filipino people we'd come back.
We're coming.
On October 20, at 10:00 in the morning... the soldiers of the American Army will land in force, right here on Leyte.
The Navy will prepare the way.
Two hours before the actual landings... there'll be heavy navy bombardment on all the landing areas.
Part of my job is to get word to all Filipino civilians in those areas... to evacuate nine days before D-day.
That'll give the Japs a good idea where to expect the landings.
There's nothing else we can do.
We can't risk civilian lives.
There haven't been any civilians here since the fall of Bataan.
If it'll save American lives and help make the landing safe...
- our people will not evacuate.
- That's right.
I'm sure glad you guys are on our side.
That won't be necessary.
Headquarters has sent me here... to help you do a job that's more important, if we can do it.
The moment naval bombardment begins... the Japs will know the exact locations of our landings.
They'll immediately try to rush reinforcements to those spots.
The only road capable of handling heavy transport... runs through the village of Bolog.
If we can block that road and hold it...
- the Japs can't get through in time.
- How long do we hold them?
From 8:00 in the morning, when the bombardment begins until 11:00.
By that time,
MacArthur's beachhead should be secure.
Okay.
But the army doesn't expect to have forces at Bolog until 2:30... which means six hours and a half before we can figure on any help.
Okay.
- Is that all, sir?
- I think so.
You don't seem to have much equipment.
We'll get more at Bolog.
There's a Jap supply depot there.
That's open country, nothing but rice paddies all around.
We know.
What this amounts to is a surprise attack in broad daylight... in open country where the Japs would probably expect something.
That's right, sir. It won't be easy.
I think you can report to headquarters that the mission will be accomplished.
Yes, sir.
- Do you have any idea how it'll be done?
- Sure.
Just so I can tell my grandchildren, how do you plan to do it?
Trickery, Commander, sheer trickery.
As a matter of fact, an old Filipino trick that I learned the hard way... from Capt. Bonifacio's grandfather.
- Any sign of anything?
- No, Your Excellency.
Have you checked the undergrowth over there?
Yes, Your Excellency. Nothing suspicious.
It's very strange.
Civilians are evacuating this area.
- Double the sentries.
- Yes, Your Excellency.
Get down, you idiot!
One more to go. I'll take the first one.
- You got a grenade, Bernessa?
- I'm all out, sir.
Hey, Bindle!
- Yeah?
- How's your pitching arm?
Come on. Let's get to work.
Japanese land mines, sir.
- Andrés, some land mines.
- Good.
Plant them far enough forward so they won't mess up our tank traps.
Put Santos in charge of TNT for the bridge.
Santos, come on.
- Bernessa.
- Yes, sir?
Get about 20 men.
We'll pick out some defense positions.
Yes, sir.
What do you got here?
Nothing big enough to stop a tank, Colonel.
Miss Barnes... they're bringing back the books they hid while the Japs were here.
And our boys are landing now.
This is it.
Fire at the parapet.
Capt. Jackson reporting, sir.
Ready to take over.
- They're all yours.
- Yes, sir.
You're three minutes late!
I brought you something.
Free Filipino soil.
You better get this arm bandaged.
There's still lots to do.
And there's plenty more where that came from.
The blood, sweat, and tears
have not been in vain.
Freedom is on the march again.
What was that?
It was yourself,
O Guardian of the Harem.
You... burped.
Silence... daughters of foolishness.
I was but paying tribute to the generosity of our lord and master.
Let us to the improvement of your minds, what there is of them.
For today's reading, we will take the story of the dancing girl and the two brothers.
Now, all together. When the noble and beloved Haroun-Al-Raschid...
"When the noble and beloved
Haroun-Al-Raschid... ascended to the throne of the Caliphs, he had many secret enemies, not least among them, being his elder brother, the passionate and cruel
Kamar-Al-Zaman, born of a slave of the harem... and barred, therefore, from the succession to the throne."
Very good, very good.
Continue alone, O my little Dunya.
"Now, it happened that in Bagdad at this time, there was a dancing girl named Sherazade... whose skill and beauty... had made her the idol of the people."
The story, the story!
Now you, Ayesha.
"Yet Sherazade, because of the poverty of her childhood, was as avid of power and riches as a shipwrecked mariner of water.
Kamar had seen the beauteous maid... and like many others, had fallen madly in love with her."
Enough, enough.
Be silent and listen.
But Sherazade had spurned his love, saying half in jest and half in earnest,
"Return to me, O Kamar, when you are
Caliph of Bagdad and I will listen to you."
But Kamar, besotted by love, had taken the jest in earnest.
And rebelling against his brother, had been defeated and captured, thereafter being condemned to suffer the punishment of the slow death... even as the law provides.
Haroun-Al-Raschid!
Salaam, O Mighty Caliph.
- Is he dead?
- Not yet.
They will tell us when.
Seven days and seven nights and still he lives.
Nadan, this is no end for one of Allah's creatures.
You must not relent, my lord.
- It is the law.
- It is man's law, not Allah's.
- He was a great warrior, Nadan.
- And a great rebel, my lord.
Were he in your place and you in his, he would be merciless.
He always hated me, even when we were children.
- Yet, now you pity him.
- Why not?
He's cursed with an ambition he could never fulfill.
Is that not to be pitied?
You mistake, my lord.
It was not ambition alone that prompted your brother to rebel.
There is a dancing girl,
Sherazade.
Sherazade?
It was to win her love that he dared to seek your throne.
A slow death for love of a woman.
Sherazade! Let us see Sherazade!
We want Sherazade!
Let us see Sherazade, the dancing girl.
All right, hurry!
Change into your acrobat costumes.
Ali? Where is Ali?
That boy is always late.
He will be the death of me. Hurry!
- Love of Allah, Sinbad!
- You're in a hurry, are you?
Yes, I...
- A great hurry.
- A terrible hurry.
The day of reckoning will come!
- We want Sherazade.
- We want Sherazade!
Listen to them.
The crowd is hungry for you tonight, mistress. You'd better hurry.
Let them wait, the fools.
I detest them!
I'm their servant, their slave.
But one day, one day when I'm above them all...
But the day never seems to come.
And there may never be another Kamar to risk his life to make you a queen.
Silence! How dare you, you...
Sherazade, my sweet!
What is this?
They are calling for you.
Let them call.
I'll come when I'm ready!
- Get out! Get out! Do you hear?
- Allah, defend me.
First it is that son of Satan, Ali, and now...
I'm going. Look, I'm going.
Good-bye. I'm going.
The madness of his desire for Sherazade has brought him to this torture.
It is the law.
Law or no law.
He's suffered enough.
Wait!
Kamar's men!
Stop him! Stop Haroun.
Free him.
By the mighty Valda, who will perform an unheard of feat... of supporting six men at the same time, unaided.
You are about to witness a most phenomenal performance of all times, including that world-famous Ali Ben Ali.
Pull in your neck, O brother, to the wine barrel.
O you grateful son of infamy!
And this is Ali, Ali the wonderful,
Ali the magnificent,
Ali, the world's greatest acrobat... who is the son of an acrobat, who himself was the son of a son of a son of a son of an acrobat.
Go!
Watch him as he climbs high above the blessed earth.
Watch Ali defying death in that death-defying feat... of standing his head upon the head of Sinbad.
Now, my noble friends, watch closely... and see how this miracle of miracles is performed.
Watch each man flex his powerful muscles... as the seventh wonder of the world...
Watch how steady this tower of men rises to the heavens!
Note how steady and straight they stand, never swaying, like the giant pine tree of the forest.
Now, watch Ali very closely as he places his head...
Pick it up a little.
Get up a little higher!
Watch Ali very closely as he places his head... upon the head of Sinbad and points his toes to the sky.
Watch them regain their balance.
Watch them sway as they bend and... bend!
Isn't it wonderful?
Watch!
The ring of the Caliph.
Haroun-Al-Raschid.
Sherazade! Give us Sherazade.
Sherazade. Give us Sherazade.
Mistress, you cannot, you must not.
You have to...
Let go of me.
- What happened?
- This stranger, he is hurt, his shoulder.
I saw it all upside down.
I would swear I have seen this man before, but where?
Maybe in your dreams.
It is written that dreams of a woman are engraved upon her heart.
I dream of no man.
Look, his eyes are opening.
Who... who are you?
I am Sherazade.
Sherazade.
I know now why... why he risked so much.
What does he mean?
Who is he?
Who were those who tried to kill him?
- The followers of Kamar.
- Of Kamar?
- How do you know?
- Look. He is dead.
That one's own mother would never recognize his face.
Now, you fortunate holders of ducats, you are about to witness the most phenomenal...
Kamar is free.
Kamar has escaped!
Kamar is free.
Kamar has escaped.
Aladdin, can't you look where you're going?
I'm looking for Sherazade.
If I don't find her, I'm lost.
You wouldn't be lost if I hadn't lost my magic lamp.
You lost that when you were a little boy.
You've lost all sense of time.
And I've lost my... I've lost...
I'm losing my mind.
Sherazade? Sherazade?
Oh, where is she?
Where is she?
I die, I expire.
Sherazade, where is she?
Oh, praise be Allah, there you are.
- Kamar, he's escaped!
- I know that.
And suppose he has?
You must hide until they've recaptured him.
Valda, quickly, prepare the litter.
Sherazade runs in fear of no man.
He will be here seeking you.
He might carry you off with him out of the country.
Against my will?
Let him dare to lay a hand on me.
Let him dare!
Sherazade, be reasonable.
Without you, I have no show.
Lovely Sherazade, maiden sweeter than honey.
I tell you, I will stay.
I am neither afraid of Kamar nor any man that lives.
But there is one thing you forget.
If you remain here, Kamar is sure to come seeking you.
It is the one place the soldiers will be looking for him.
- He is sure to be taken again.
- What is that to me?
You have said it is written in your stars that you will be a queen.
If Kamar leaves Bagdad now alone, he will have a chance outside the city to organize his followers, to try again to seize his brother's throne.
- Then you could be a queen indeed.
- I wonder.
It is the way, Sherazade, the way of destiny.
Believe me.
You are right, Ali.
Well, what are you waiting for, you fool?
Hurry, you fools! Come a running!
Sinbad, come! Hurry! Run!
Do something! Get the baskets!
What about the wounded one?
- He has nothing to do with us.
- Kamar's men tried to kill him.
If they return seeking you and find him...
Very well.
He shall come with us.
Come! Move! Go!
- Here.
- If I only had my magic lamp.
One rub and out popped a genie ten leagues high, my slave.
You've told that lamp story so often, you believe it yourself!
Look, look. My lamp!
Oh, the genie at last!
This is no time for sleeping.
I told you to get the litter.
Come! Move!
Aladdin. Sinbad.
Forward, all of you. Bear that litter. Move, you fools!
You, with the cart, forward!
Name of Allah, hurry!
Don't tire yourself working so hard, Sinbad.
This calls to mind an experience
I had when I was a sailor.
We don't want to hear it.
I'd like less Sinbad the sailor, more Sinbad the worker.
Stop your lies and lend a hand.
This particular voyage had lasted for six long years.
Here's the body.
How do you know it's Haroun?
He wears a robe and a ring of the Caliph.
Hail, O Kamar-Al-Zaman.
This day you shall mount the throne of the Caliphs in your brother's stead.
My throne... and Sherazade's.
I have already sent the captain of the guard to escort her here, my lord.
Nadan, you've helped me to achieve my greatest happiness.
You'll not find me ungrateful.
To serve you loyally is reward enough, my lord.
The captain has returned, my lord.
Let him enter.
Where's Sherazade?
I... I do not know, my lord.
- She has disappeared.
- You lie.
It is the truth, O mighty one.
The circus has gone and all the players with it.
I can find no trace of them.
I tried, but...
Stop babbling like a fool.
The girl must be found. Take your men and search every house in the city.
Find Sherazade and bring her here!
Captain, a word, a word of interest to you.
I have great influence with the Caliph.
I do not wish it to be destroyed by a dancing girl.
Such a beautiful beard.
- He'll probably want to kill you!
- He'll thank me.
Oh, I still say we should have found a doctor for that wound of his.
No, Aladdin, that's not it either.
Well? What are you doing?
Just what you told us, keeping quiet and hiding.
Do you have to keep quiet so quietly?
There's work to be done.
Did you find out?
What of Kamar?
Allah protect us.
No one knows.
Bagdad is in such a turmoil and just when we're doing so much business!
Is he still here?
Name of the prophet, what have you done to him?
Anyway, who asked you to pick up dying strangers in the street
- to share my quarters and eat my food?
- He's eaten none of your food.
Hear that? He's awakening.
Hungry, I'll wager my life.
Quiet, fat one.
Kamar.
- Kamar.
- Kamar is not here.
Who are you?
Who...
We are your friends.
But this place, how have I come here?
I...
- Who dared?
- I was your barber, good sir.
It was necessary.
The followers of Kamar are everywhere.
Everywhere, are they?
Well, I'll...
You're weak from loss of blood.
I'm afraid I need food and something to drink.
I knew it!
See? I told you. He's a beggar.
Now see here, you. If you would share in our food, you must work.
What can you do?
Can you juggle, stand on your head?
That's it!
You... standing on your head.
- It wasn't a dream.
- No, it certainly was not.
- And afterwards, a girl.
- There was a girl?
Yes. Sherazade.
Sherazade.
Of course.
But where is she?
- In there, asleep.
- She nursed you most of the night.
Your shoulder.
All this is very nice, but my question is still unanswered.
You, sir, are you in a position to pay for all these ministrations?
Ahmad, be silent.
You shall be repaid, all of you, many fold.
- But how soon?
- At once, today.
As soon as I return to my... to my home.
- But what guarantee have I of all this?
- Please, Ahmad!
This man to me is but an unsampled well on a strange oasis.
Why should I trust him?
My face is not enough?
A face is but a face.
Skin and bones with eyes.
Yours could be the face of a rogue, a robber, a cutthroat!
How should I know?
Then suppose I swear to repay you?
Swear by the beard of the Caliph?
Would that suffice?
Of course it would!
I know I shall regret this.
But you...
Here.
Valda, bring him food and wine, the new wine.
And the rest of you, because we all must be idle, must you all be idle?
There's work to be done.
Go, go!
This calls to mind an experience
I had when I was a sailor.
- In farthermost...
- No tales, Sinbad.
Work, work. Here, take this.
Ingrate! Brother to the only brother of an only brother of an idiot!
You must forgive Ahmad.
He is really kindhearted.
I know. And I'm grateful to him and all of you.
- Hail, O Mighty Caliph.
- You know?
- Yes.
- But the others?
I was afraid to tell them.
They might have made too much fuss.
And I had problems enough.
You're a very old one for one so young.
What is your name?
Ali Ben Ali.
Your slave 'til death,
O Mighty Caliph.
Not my slave, Ali, my friend.
Who, from this hour forth, can ask anything in my power to grant.
It is his.
Thank you, noble one.
It was Sherazade who really saved you.
It was she who got Ahmad to let us bring you here.
- The girl does not know?
- No.
Yet she... she cared for me through half the night.
- Why?
- She is a woman.
And all women, like all mules, are unpredictable.
Only Sherazade is worse than any mule!
Sherazade!
We were just speaking about you.
Ahmad will be looking for me.
I better go help the others.
The tongue of Ali is swift, too swift for his own good.
Will you sit with me while I eat?
I understand I have much to thank you for.
It was the whim of Ali that you should come with us.
I did not mind.
And last night... nursing me?
I could not sleep anyway.
You would really trouble yourself for no man, except perhaps Kamar.
Everyone knows you promised to marry him if he became Caliph.
And why not?
It is my destiny to marry a king and rule a kingdom.
- Written in your stars.
- You don't believe it?
You think I am not worthy to be a queen?
I think you're sublimely worthy.
There's one trouble.
What if your friend Kamar never gains the throne?
Then he will do without me.
And if he loves you?
I do not desire love.
I desire power.
- You are sure of that, Sherazade?
- I am sure.
You say that with your lips.
There's a different answer in your eyes.
You are dreaming.
You are a woman to make men dream.
You could love a man for himself alone, regardless of power, of everything.
No, it is not true.
I will not let it be true!
Sherazade! Sherazade!
Word has just come.
Kamar, they've made him Caliph.
Haroun is dead.
They found his body last night.
And Kamar has been proclaimed
Caliph by the Great Council.
- His soldiers control the city!
- So the Caliph Haroun is dead!
- Believe me, I did not know...
- Never mind, Ali.
In fact there are times when it is most desirable to be dead.
Kamar, Caliph of Bagdad.
Kamar upon the throne!
Did I not tell you?
You are not yet on the throne beside him.
Of course she is.
Already she is as good as queen.
Sherazade, whom I have loved as my own daughter, for whom I have done countless favors.
The good, the sweet, the grateful Sherazade.
Listen.
- Are you the dancing girl, Sherazade?
- I am.
You are to come with me and your friends with you.
You hear? All of us!
- By whose command?
- The new Caliph, Kamar-Al-Zaman.
But a moment to prepare and I am ready.
Did you hear? His first act as
Caliph was to send for Sherazade.
I shall be practicing how to salaam when you pass by.
- You must not go. Stay here.
- I will go.
But remember from now forward my name is Ahmeen.
I better find you some other clothes!
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
What is this?
Why have you brought us here?
This does not look to me like the way to the palace.
- I do not like it.
- Be silent.
No one has asked for your opinion.
You must get away.
This may be your last chance.
Look!
Slave traders!
Be ready.
- Now what?
- Slave traders.
So this is the girl.
Good.
In fact, excellent, excellent!
Is this man mad?
When the new Caliph hears of this...
The new Caliph Kamar will never hear.
Where we are sending you, not even Allah himself could find you.
Chain them, quickly!
Hurry, go! Hurry, hurry!
Pick him up.
Hold him fast!
Put the chains on him.
Inside.
No! You, back there.
The amount agreed upon.
You, you, bear the litter.
Follow me.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Allah, Allah!
Allah. Praise Allah.
Praise be to the prophet.
"Be it known to all loyal subjects... that any person bringing news of the whereabouts... of the dancing girl Sherazade and her companions... to the summer palace of the Caliph will be richly rewarded."
Tighter!
Tighter!
No!
Son of infamy, every bone in your body shall be broken if you continue to defy me.
The blind beggar said you sold Sherazade into slavery.
Is that true?
Tighter!
Tighter.
More!
Enough!
- I know nothing, my lord.
- You lie.
There must've been others with you in this plot. Who were they?
Tell me their names and I promise you a quick death.
- See that he lives 'til he speaks.
- Yes, my lord.
I am going now to find her.
No power on earth can keep me from that.
If when I return you're still alive,
I promise you an eternity of suffering.
Slacken the rope.
I can release you from this torture if you will be honest with me.
The blind one spoke the truth, did he not?
Yes, my lord.
You told me to make certain that the girl would never return so I thought...
You could obey my commands and fill your purse at the same time.
I meant no harm, my lord.
What is the slave trader's name?
Hakim.
Where can I find him?
At the marketplace of El Bessera.
It is the truth, my lord.
You have served me well... and I shall release you.
Now, my noble sirs,
I have 90 dinars bid.
Surely a trifling figure for so sublime a slave.
Do I hear 100?
Oh, come now, noble sirs.
Behold this young, beauteous damsel.
See, my noble gentlemen.
I remove her veil.
And now, my noble sirs, do I have your final bid... for this ravishing vision of loveliness?
I have 90 dinars.
Who'll say 100?
- One hundred dinars!
- She is sold.
Sold to the merchant Abdullah.
Quickly. Fetch another.
Next one.
You!
Hurry.
- Come on. Hurry.
- I am ready!
Come on!
- Does it move?
- Not yet.
Sherazade, there's still a chance.
You must not give up hope.
What have I to hope for?
That out there?
And now, my noble sirs, we have another tempting and tantalizing morsel,
Marzena, the exquisite flower of the Nile.
What am I bid?
150 dinars!
I have 150 dinars.
Will someone say 200?
Oh, come, noble sirs!
200 dinars!
Stand back.
Let me.
Come along, my masters, bid.
- Have you no eyes for beauty?
- 200 dinars!
That is a man who speaks.
Who'll make it 250?
250 dinars.
They are in a good mood.
It's time to offer them the dancing girl. Bring her.
Who says 300?
Come, my good sirs, who'll say 300? 300!
Speak one of you. Are you all women?
Or will one of you say 300?
- 300 dinars.
- She is sold!
Sold to the noble and most venerable Kassim Baba.
May Allah strengthen him.
They are coming for Sherazade.
- So this is the end.
- No, Sherazade, listen to me.
- You, on the top tier, forward.
- There are things I cannot explain, but in my rightful place
I have power, great power.
Somehow I will regain that power.
Then I swear to you, I'll seek you out and set you free, free to fulfill your destiny.
And if I am dead when that day comes?
No, Sherazade.
All right, you, outside.
- Not you, step back.
- Where I go, she goes.
Sherazade, you must believe me.
Here, I'll help.
Pull!
Wait! Wait! And now, noble sirs, prepare yourselves... for a sight such as is seldom seen by mortal eyes.
A vision of beauty beyond your dreams.
A foretaste of paradise itself.
She is as a young moon, mounting the stairway of the stars.
See how she approaches.
What poise, what grace.
See, my noble lords, what an exquisite creature.
Think that she can be yours or yours or yours to possess for all time.
Do not dare. I warn you, if you show me to those men, this will be yours.
I swear it.
Do you hear that, you old men?
If this man as much as touches me,
I swear I will kill him.
What am I to do?
You she-cat!
Noble sirs, you see my plight.
This impossible creature...
No, no, no, I mean, this superb woman of character... cannot bear to deprive one of you of the privilege... of being alone in his joy.
Which one of you is to be that lucky man?
Oh, come, sirs, what am I bid?
Unveil her. Come, come, unveil her.
Unveil her.
We want to see her first!
Does it mean nothing to you to have the sole, the exclusive, the breathtaking privilege of seeing the beauteous damsel alone?
1,000 dinars.
Ah, that's better, noble sir.
I am bid...
What was that you said, noble sir?
1,000 dinars.
A thou...
Come this way, noble sir.
Come this way.
Sherazade has been sold.
- May we know the name of the noble lord?
- Do you wish names or gold?
Together now! Together!
Let me go too, master.
This must not fail.
The rest of you, be ready.
Help! Help!
Help! Let us out!
- Hey, let us out!
- What is this?
The plague!
- We shall all die.
- And you'll lose your money!
Let them out.
Hurry up, you fool, let them out.
The rope!
I'll wait for you at the dunes of El Sohmra.
- Shall I help you hold him?
- No, help me let go of him.
- But if the slavers should follow.
- They will not.
- You are safe, Sherazade.
- Ali, Ahmad and the others?
They, too, will have escaped.
I told Ali we would meet here.
Then we will return to Bagdad, to the palace of Kamar.
No, not to Kamar.
Sherazade, you shall not return to Bagdad now.
You will ride with me beyond the river.
You speak as though
I were your slave.
There are different kinds of slavery... a woman taught me.
A woman?
A woman whose beauty shames the glory of the desert sunset.
Hello?
Hello!
Ahmeen! Sherazade!
You see?
As I told you, they are free!
Ahmad, you are safe!
All of you!
Never fear, my little one.
We were more than a match for those cutthroats.
We must hurry to the river.
There is still danger.
In the village is a smithy where we can be rid of our chains.
Hurry, we must go quickly!
- Can he not work faster?
- Silence!
Don't sound like a frightened woman.
Even on that slave block, you were unafraid.
Fear and anger walk different roads.
By the beard of the prophet, you would have killed that slaver.
I would.
Only those who wear chains, know the joys of freedom.
Enough of this philosophy. What we need is speed! Should those slavers come...
- If you have the strength, O feeble one.
- O stomach of jelly!
If my wife were here, she could break you from your chains.
The boat is here, but the ferryman is afraid to take us across.
I will persuade him. Come to the boat as soon as you are ready.
I'm sure your wife would be more gentle.
You know this calls to mind an experience I once had.
Sinbad, this is no time for tales.
- Come. Sinbad will follow.
- What if the ferryman should refuse him?
He won't.
Ahmeen will not fail his friends.
Listen.
The slavers!
Quickly, hurry!
We must go quickly!
Hurry, hurry! Come on!
Lay down your arms.
In whose name?
In the name of Kamar Zaman, the Caliph of Bagdad.
- These are the men?
- Yes, lord, yes. I swear I did not know...
Silence!
Where is she?
Sherazade, where is she?
Sherazade... at last!
At last.
You see, my beloved, a city built on the sands of the desert to receive you.
This and all Bagdad shall be yours.
My lord, you should not enter that city.
If you'd be recognized...
Sherazade may need me.
Onward!
Salaam.
Salaam,
O commander of the faithful.
You see, Nadan, my search has been rewarded.
You are the chosen of Allah.
Sherazade, this is Nadan, my Grand Vizier and friend, as loyal as my right hand.
Peace and happiness be with you and your beloved, O my lady.
Nadan, prepare a feast that shall be remembered through the ages.
Let us have wine and music.
This is the day when only joy is in the tents of the Caliph.
Saleem will escort you to your quarters.
- What clothes!
- What luxury!
- What food!
- And you have me to thank for it all.
Sherazade had something to do with it.
May I get you something to eat?
There was no triumph in her eyes when she looked at me, only sadness.
- Only that, my lord?
- What else?
- Perhaps love.
- I dare to hope so.
While you had eyes only for
Sherazade, Nadan was watching.
I think he recognized you.
If he did, I must go to him and caution him to keep my secret from Sherazade.
She must not know who I am yet.
You cannot trust him!
He's loyal to Kamar.
- This is madness.
- Well, what would you have me do then?
Reveal yourself to your people, not to Nadan.
When they know you're alive, they will rise and restore you to the throne.
You there, you are wanted.
You must find Sherazade.
Tell her to have courage and I will keep my promise.
Come.
What do they want with him?
What has happened?
I'll try to find out.
This is the man, my lord.
You may leave us.
Wait outside.
Come closer.
I am told it was you who planned the escape from the slave market.
I played my part, my lord.
And that it was you who rescued
Sherazade from the man who bought her.
It was my fortune to be the first to reach her.
Perhaps that was because you had a stronger motive.
- What motive, my lord?
- The strongest of all, love.
Who am I to aspire to Sherazade, the chosen of Kamar?
Who or what you are is no matter.
Love can come to the lowliest and to the highest.
That is true, my lord.
But the lowliest can hardly dare to hope to be loved for himself alone...
- by one as far above him as the stars.
- Then you do love Sherazade.
- My lord, I did not say...
- I say it!
I watched you closely when she was with Kamar.
Your lips may lie now, but then your eyes told me the truth.
Arrest this man.
Not so fast, little one.
- Is it forbidden to enter there?
- Forbidden?
No man but the Caliph and the
Lord Vizier can enter the harem.
But I'm not a man.
I'm only a boy.
Boys grow fast.
Now be off with you!
You cannot loiter here.
Well? What are you staring at, son-of-a-frog?
At your magnificence,
O mightier than the moon.
I was thinking, when I grow up, I, too, might stand guard over the harem of the Caliph.
Make a prayer that you won't have to do it in such a heat as this.
Your kerchief is red and angry like the sun.
Perhaps if it were blue, it would be more cooling.
But I, I have no blue one.
- Now you have, O mighty one.
- Beelzebub! Magic!
- Doubtless, too, your honor is thirsty.
- As a goat in the desert!
Drink, my lord.
Now I'll make it vanish. Watch.
By Allah!
He, too, has vanished.
A boy! Catch him!
Catch him! Catch him!
- Bring him here. Show him to us.
- Let's see him!
No! Please let me go.
It is serious.
Don't be serious.
What brought you here?
- I came to find Sherazade.
- The new favorite.
- I bring her a message from...
- A lover?
Already a tryst!
We must help him.
If Kamar should find out, he'd be furious.
There's the tent of Sherazade.
We must move cautiously.
Let's hide him.
What are you doing there?
- What do we do now?
- What can we do?
Start a fight!
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
Get in the water.
Stop it, I say.
Stop it.
Come here! Come here!
Come here!
Here he comes!
Look at this one.
Just think of it. From now on, you can have everything you want.
Sherazade? Sherazade?
Sherazade?
Ali! I have come with a message from my master.
He said he will keep his promise.
But he's in great danger.
And he's heedless of that danger because of his love for you.
Make way, make way for the Grand Vizier.
Look!
You mustn't be found here.
Quick!
What is this man to you?
Is he your lover?
- I have loved no man.
- But he has admitted that he loves you.
- He said that?
- And you love him.
That isn't true!
Can't you understand?
She is Sherazade, whose dream it was to marry a king.
Why should she choose a humble player?
- Do you still deny he is your lover?
- Yes.
He came to us by chance before we were sold into slavery.
He will regret that escape from the tender mercies of those slavers.
Guard!
What are you going to do?
What will happen to him?
There are many ways that death can come to a man.
His will not be easy.
But he's our friend!
What has he done that he should die?
You really love him, do you not?
Yes, yes, I love him!
Help me. Save him.
I'll be your slave. Only save him!
If I save him,
I shall need your help.
What do you want me to do?
This ring.
You see?
Wear it.
At the feast, when the marriage cup is brought, the slave will already have tasted the wine. Kamar will suspect nothing.
As you pass your hands over the cup during the betrothal dance...
It should be easy.
- And he?
- I will sign an order for his release... and provide an escort as far as the border.
Once across the river, he should be quite safe.
Why are you doing this?
What will you gain?
My rightful place that belongs to the strongest.
The throne.
I have been a servant long enough.
Now I will be king.
Come, make up your mind!
How do I know you will keep your word?
You will see him leave the encampment yourself. Will that satisfy you?
Very well.
I will make the arrangements.
When the time comes,
I will let you know.
I have kept my bargain.
See that you keep yours.
He is to reach the other bank of the river safely, but then...
I understand, my lord.
- You expect us to believe all of that?
- You must believe it!
- Haroun-Al-Raschid!
- Haroun-Al-Raschid...
And I thought he was a beggar.
I asked him if he could juggle.
We must do something!
What can we do?
Haroun's safe conduct goes only as far as the river.
We must get there before the soldiers and hide the ferryboat.
I have a plan.
We'll go to the smithy and...
All we want is to borrow your smithy for an hour.
Borrow it?
- That's right.
- Don't worry. You'll be paid.
- You paid me nothing before.
- You paid him nothing?
- In that case, we'll double it.
- What?
Clear off, offspring of a beggar!
- Did you get the boat?
- Yes, we have it hidden downstream.
Good, good. Watch for the soldiers.
What's going on out there?
Ahmad! They are here.
The soldiers are coming.
Smith?
Oh, there you are.
We want the ferryboat.
- The ferryboat?
- Yes.
- Oh, oh, the, uh... the, uh, ferryboat.
- Yes.
- It's out of service.
- Out of service?
It's on account of the ferryman.
He's sick with confusionitis.
You see, for 25 years he's been going to and fro, and fro and to.
And most of the time he didn't know whether he was fro or to.
Have you ever been to when you were supposed to be fro?
- It makes you wish you'd never started.
- This isn't getting us anyplace.
That's exactly what the ferryman said to his wife after his 4,000th round-trip.
Oh, excuse me, but there's a woman in there... who used to know on which side of the river the ferryman lived.
I'll go in and ask her.
Oh, if you have to leave, don't go until you come back.
I can't hold off the corporal much longer.
The man's crazy!
That, that... that gives me an idea.
- One of you will have to be a woman.
- No!
I'll do it. When I was with the Strolling Players,
- I was known as the Bag of Bagdad.
- You can't do it with that beard.
Ridiculous! The woman that I loved most dearly had a beard like that.
The corporal isn't that crazy.
No, you'll have to shave it off.
My beard? Rather my life than my beard.
But it's Haroun's life that matters now. Valda.
No, no, no.
Off with the beard.
No, Valda, I forbid it.
I forbid it. Valda, don't!
The woman said, the last time she saw...
There's a horse with a split hoof.
See to it.
Who, me?
You! What's the matter with you?
- You're the smith, aren't you?
- Oh, uh... Yes, yes, yes.
Come on. I'll show you.
- He'll have to get down.
- Can't you manage without?
Without? Don't be ridiculous.
Don't you think I know my own trade?
Come on.
- Right this way, sir.
- Help bind him.
You'll be comfortable here.
You need not be gentle with that accursed one.
By the stars, this better be the one.
Allah, preserve us.
What was that?
- That was Sultana.
- A camel?
Oh, no. A woman, a very beautiful woman.
Oh? I'm going to look for the ferryman.
I'll come back later.
- Why don't you come back now?
- Well, I...
Don't begin that again.
Get on with your work.
Where did I put my anvil? Sultana, what have you done with my anvil?
Did you call, father?
Oh, I... I didn't know you had company.
What a beautiful distribution of flesh.
The most magnificent.
Not only the most magnificent, but the most.
Um... may I?
Coochi-coochi-coochi.
- I've stood enough.
- Not now. Wait 'til we get him in here.
Coochi-coochi-coochi.
- What's going on here?
- I only chucked her under the chin.
Which chin?
How dare you pay court to my beloved.
- Silly boy, takes so much for granted.
- Away with you!
I dare you to cross this threshold.
I defy you to enter here.
Aren't you going to accept his challenge?
- Oh, you do, do you?
- I double...
Peasant dreams.
Eedee, jedee, midee, moe.
Jedee, moe. The corporal, come.
Come quickly!
Come, the corporal!
Quick, go!
Come.
Wine! Wine! Come.
Wine. Wine.
Ali, what are you doing here?
Nadan ordered his soldiers to kill you at the river.
- Why did he pretend to free me?
- He made a bargain with Sherazade.
- What bargain?
- She agreed to poison Kamar's wine...
- in return for your safety.
- What does my safety mean to her?
She loves you, my lord, and she's in great danger.
Hurry, we must go quickly!
The soldiers are sleeping peacefully.
We await your commands,
O Mighty Caliph.
Ali, cross the river and rouse my people.
The rest of you, mount your horses and follow me.
Proceed.
Bring the wedding gifts.
We will drink to our betrothal.
- Sherazade.
- Ahmeen!
- Seize that man!
- Sinbad! Sinbad!
Sinbad!
Guards, stop them!
Do you not recognize me, my brother?
- Haroun.
- Haroun-Al-Raschid!
- The rightful Caliph!
- Haroun-Al-Raschid!
Haroun-Al-Raschid!
Why did you not tell me, my lord?
I could not until
I was sure of your love.
Her love?
Now, my brother, you condemned me to the slow death.
Yours shall be swift and sure.
By Allah!
This has got to be the one.
Beautiful lamp. Magic...
It worked! It worked!
The palace guard. Look!
Oh, no, you won't!
Oh, Sherazade.
Hail, Haroun-Al-Raschid!
The rightful monarch thus regained his throne.
There was great rejoicing throughout the land.
Sherazade and Haroun lived in peace and happiness all their days.
Did that really happen,
O Guardian of the Harem?
Of course it did.
Thus, as Allah had willed, so did it come to pass.
Everything happens, roof falls down, walls fall down... bottom falls down there...
Chico falls down.
Don't call me Chico.
I am Johnny Munroe, best engineer in South America.
I'll build a railroad through that mountain.
Hurry up. Come on, dig.
- How about it, Johnny?
- Anytime now.
I work all day,
I work all night to build a railroad.
Get out of the way, scram.
Me, Johnny Munroe, will now make the blast.
- Everything comes down.
- Fire in the hole!
My head! My head!
I'm hurt.
My head. I'm hurt.
- I'm hurt.
- Is he hurt?
Oh, a little scratch.
I thought I told you kids not to play around here when we're blasting.
There, it is fix, I think.
Better take him to medico and make sure.
Come on.
Chico, I ought to take down your breeches and paddle your rump.
- What were you doing?
- I am the engineer.
Engineer, eh?
Well, a good engineer doesn't get his men hurt.
If he does, he has to be punished.
Step up here.
Now, get out of here.
All of you.
He hit you on your face.
Yes, he hit me with his fist because I am an engineer.
But you, he will take down your breeches and paddle your rump.
You too.
What's the delay?
Where's the second shot?
Waiting on Joe.
Slowest blaster in the Andes.
Nobody ain't waiting on me.
Just say when and duck your head.
All right, when.
Fire in the hole!
Hey, Joe, eureka!
When the last rock falls, the drinks will be on Johnny Munroe.
- Leave us go, brothers.
- Hold everything. Where are you going?
Baby Blue Eyes promised us a weekend in Tenango... if we took out the full face.
- There it is, right in your lap.
- Tenango?
Oh, not this weekend. No, no, Fog.
That's out.
Out? Why?
Why? You know why.
I've gotta see Alexander first thing in the morning at the hotel.
And with you guys in town...
Look, Johnny, if we don't get a lining for that tunnel... you'll find that mountain on your weary shoulders one afternoon.
Well, why tell me about it?
I'm the fellow that wanted to build a bridge across the river.
You bid in the tunnel.
I bid in on the tunnel because Alexander wanted a tunnel.
And it's his money.
We just follow specifications.
Those are little things that come in your department, Pop.
Specifications, money...
Money, did I say money?
We'll need about... one, two, three, four, 500 pesos.
No Tenango this weekend.
No Tenango, no tunnel.
No tunnel, no railroad.
No railroad, no get paid.
No get paid, no Tenango.
And that brings us back right where we started.
That's right and we need about 500 pesos.
Oh, Johnny.
One, two, 250, three...
Look, no more midnight serenades under the mayor's balcony.
Oh, no, of course not. Those are the kinds of things that only happen once.
Three-fifty, four...
And look, stay out of sight while I'm talking to Alexander Sunday morning.
- Sure. Sure.
- Four-fifty.
He don't like that stuff. He's plenty tough without your making it worse.
- Yeah, I know.
- Five.
Thanks, Pop.
And stay out of sight!
I'll be in Tenango too, you know.
You agree, then.
The specifications do not call for a concrete lining.
Sure, and I can understand your engineer's reasons... for not including one.
This stuff doesn't start to flake off until the air hits it, and then...
Of course, you couldn't know this.
Nobody could.
Ks out & section of the root.
Well, that may be just a temporary condition.
Why not drive another few hundred yards and see if it changes?
Yes.
Yes, that sounds reasonable.
Reasonable but not practical.
Have to build 5 bigger concrete plant,
- And that'll take time.
- And money.
My money.
And I might add the... stockholders' money too.
What is the meaning of this?
- This is Sunday morning.
- Probably a late party.
Some people up from the coast.
Those things happen.
- Mr. Mathews, if this...
- Those things don't happen in Tenango.
They never have and
I don't intend that they shall.
- Yes, Uncle Frederick.
- Go find the manager.
Mr. What's-his-name?
Hernandez. Tell him I don't like it.
You'd like it less if the hotel didn't make money.
It may interest you to know, my dear Ricky... the hotel does not make money.
I support it because it's become a habit.
And the same is true of some of my relatives.
Go and find Hernandez.
Can't that wait until we reach a decision on this?
I'll reach my own decisions.
Do as you're told.
Before we go any further,
Mr. Mathews... have you spoken to your partner about his weekends in Tenango?
I have, and I can assure you there will be no more of that nonsense.
Johnny and the boys hit town last night, probably had drinks, went right to bed.
I don't know what you're saying but you must be mad.
So it was not enough.
Go ahead and shoot it.
- What's the matter? Are you loco?
- Ricky.
Tell this fellow I promised the boys a party and this is it.
Hey, what happened to the dames?
- Where's the music gone?
- Listen, my uncle's on the warpath...
Better get out of sight.
Come to my office, Hernandez.
I've something to say to you.
- I've got something to say to you.
- Pop, save it.
I've had eight hot towels and a double massage... and you still look like a shimmering landscape.
Tell it to them, I need air.
Waiter.
Good morning.
We're gonna take a walk.
I wanna talk to you guys.
Hey, look.
It's a habit he picked up when he was a kid.
Come on.
- See you later, Ricky.
- Bye, Pop.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
No.
Oh, hello, Ricky.
She's my favorite cousin, Johnny.
- She is?
- I thought you ought to know... just in case one day
I might have to shoot you.
Johnny, this is completely wrong.
It's the custom of the country, isn't it?
Yes, I know it is, but not this way.
I'll introduce you at the proper time.
- Swell. What's her name?
- Maura.
- But this is not the time.
- Why not?
Well, down here, we...
All right. You"ll see.
- This the window?
- Yeah.
I like this, Ricky. It's a cute idea.
Back home, I'd just walk up and punch that bell.
Not that bell.
What's the matter, Johnny?
- Frederick Alexander?
- The Frederick Alexander.
In all of Tenango, less than five families are privileged... to walk through that doorway.
Unfortunately, Mr. Munroe, you don't happen to be one of them.
Could have saved me a lot of time and walking by telling that earlier.
I tried to tell you but you wouldn't listen.
Let's get away before my uncle...
Oh, hello, Maura.
Why, Ricky...
Maura, dear, may I present Mr. Munroe.
He's one of the contractors building the railroad for your father.
How do you do?
Well, I...
- Are you staying?
- Sure, I've come this far.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.
For your body.
- Hey, Ricky.
- What?
Can you use a band?
No.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'm not very good on my feet.
And when you sit down, you can hardly stay awake.
Oh, you remembered.
Maybe I should have kept the guitars.
These balcony scenes kind of confuse me.
Well, next time, why not bring your copy of Shakespeare?
Next time? What happens this time?
I've already used two of those 10 minutes Ricky gave me.
If I let you sit down... do you think you can stay awake for the remaining eight?
I think so.
That door.
That door?
Thank you.
- Well, what do you want?
- You sent for me.
- Did I?
- Yes.
Oh, yes.
I've been considering your suggestion about Maura's studies.
Yes?
I've noticed what she's been reading lately.
I should watch that very carefully if I were you.
Maura is at an age when...
Well, girls are apt to get a little out of hand.
Maura is a woman.
She is also an Alexander.
You don't like this, do you?
- No.
- Why not?
Well, it's foolish to paint by artificial light, and...
And what?
You don't do it well.
I've always considered... that a man should be allowed to do one thing badly.
Provided, of course, he doesn't inflict his mistakes on others.
I store my paintings in the vault... for posterity.
- Along with a lot of other things.
- What do you mean?
Your daughter.
My daughter doesn't happen to be one of my mistakes.
Let us say instead that she is my greatest accomplishment.
If her mother were alive,
I'm sure she would agree with me.
She was also a sound art critic.
She happened to like my paintings.
- She was in love with you.
- Naturally.
But of course, you wouldn't understand that.
I'm sure I wouldn't.
Never having created a daughter... many of the things I do must seem strange to you.
I look at the beginnings.
The embryo.
But here...
I see the finished canvas.
A glorious woman.
Cultured, poised.
Ready to take an important position in the world as the wife of a...
- Well, what shall I say?
- You've already picked her husband?
I'm sorry.
What were we discussing?
- Maura's husband.
- No, no, I don't mean that. Her studies.
The things that I've laid out for her to do this year.
Oh, I think they can wait.
While, as you say, I have never created a daughter of my own... for some strange reason,
God made me a woman.
That's why I know that this morning...
Or perhaps it was yesterday morning... when Maura woke up and looked in the mirror... she saw not a girl, but a woman.
A woman whose life for all her
20-odd years has been run... as though it were a mine or a railroad.
She resented it.
She still resents it.
If you don't stop trying to live your daughter's life for her... you may regret it.
Of course I realize that you believe what you're saying to be true.
In the future, you will please confine your suggestions to Maura's studies.
And you will get my permission before you take up anything new with her.
Good night.
- Mr. Alexander.
- Well, what is it?
You do love your daughter, don't you?
Of course. Why do you ask?
Well, it might be nice if she knew it too.
This is a mountain and this is a tin mine and there's a river, runs right along...
Right around here.
That's the river.
I still think it would be smarter to throw a bridge across it.
But if the stockholders want a...
A tunnel, they'll get a tunnel.
We'll drive right through Mt. Tormento and across the plains... and from there on, it's easy going.
Three, four months, we reach the tin mines and that's it, end of track.
And then where?
Oh, wherever they want a railroad.
Alaska, perhaps.
China, Tibet or Brooklyn.
Say, what time is it?
It must be the altitude.
This thing says my visit's over and I feel it's hardly begun.
Why hurry away?
Ricky gave me only 10 minutes.
And you've used them all to talk about you.
I'm sorry.
Don't you think Ricky might give us 10 minutes more... so I could tell you about me?
Sounds interesting.
Tell me about me.
Well, I was born...
Under a lucky star some 20-odd years ago... with the most beautiful eyes
I've seen in South America.
You got a cute little nose too... though you carry it rather high at times.
Go on, tell me more about me.
Oh, I could go on like this for hours.
Your raven black hair...
Oh, that's right, you're the lady who doesn't believe in love at first sight.
- Go up to your room, Maura.
- Please, Father, don't take that attitude.
This is Mr. Munroe, we were simply talking...
Go to your room.
Mr. Alexander,
I know this doesn't exactly look...
Good night, Mr. Munroe.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I thought that I had bred a gentlewoman, Maura.
I find that I've made a mistake.
I'm surprised to hear you admit you can make a mistake.
Maura.
After tonight, I doubt if I shall ever be surprised again.
I find my daughter...
Talking to a man.
In the arms of a drunken, brawling lout... who a few hours ago was associating with...
I've heard of such things.
I understand that it was a custom in pagan Rome... that woman of breeding amused themselves with gladiators.
Amused themselves?
Where do you find this boldness?
Finish what you were saying.
Tell me about the man you found in your daughter's arms.
Don't say that again, Maura.
- Why not?
- Don't say that again.
Go on, finish what you were saying.
Of course you wouldn't know of such men.
How could I expect you to know of such men?
But you do know better than to ask any man into this house... into my home.
I thought perhaps it was my home too.
It is your home, Maura.
It was also the home of your mother.
And as such, ll expect you to treat it with respect... even though you have so little for yourself.
- Hey, Curly.
- Yeah?
- Take a look at the plans?
- For the concrete plant?
Yeah.
So Fog's making very cozy with the big blond.
You following me?
Yeah, I'm listening.
Joe's telling me about Fog and the blond.
Women, trouble, trouble, women.
They're all the same thing.
And right there under the hammock,
I've got an exploder planted.
I've got it rigged up to the light, see?
So when Fog reaches up to turn off the light...
So when Fog reaches up to turn off the light...
And the big blond said,
"Fog, you're dynamite.”
Yeah.
Hi, Brains.
Hi, Brawn.
All drilled and ready to load.
Or do you want me to do that too?
No, I let you fire one shot the other night... and look what happened to that hammock.
How many sticks are you using?
Only a hundred.
Shooting light on account of the roof.
Let's take a look there.
Kill the lights!
Douse the circuit.
Kill the lights.
This kind of trouble will be over... if Pop comes back with that okay from Alexander.
Hold that thing, will you?
Okay, take it away.
How's it look?
Straining plenty, but Fog did a good job of timbering.
She'll hold, I think.
- Wanna do your thinking outside?
- What?
How about thinking outside?
You gonna shoot that from in here?
Well, we've gotta start trusting this roof some time.
I wish I had worn my little tin hat.
Pull in your ears.
Fire in the hole!
Hit the lights!
Boy, oh, boy, it's great to be alive.
How did it go? You still here?
All right, bring them in.
Hit the whistle!
Johnny, Joe, are you all right in there?
Are you all right back there?
- No, we're both dead.
- Wonderful.
Brother, that's a little too close for comfort.
You can't trust that guy with a pistol, let alone dynamite.
All right, get those dump cars in here, get this muck cleared out.
- Pop's gonna love this.
- He sure is.
I built you a nice clean tunnel and look what you did.
Why don't you buy a little book on blasting and learn how it's done?
Why don't you put timber under this stuff?
You ain't building a wigwam, you know.
Sometimes I wonder.
Sometimes I wish we don't have to build this tunnel.
He is a stinker.
That just about covers it.
Did you feed the pigeons?
Yes. And a little bit extra.
Good.
The roof falls down, the walls fall down... the bottom falls down.
Everything...
Any luck?
Yeah, plenty.
And all bad.
Johnny, I don't know what could have happened.
I'd have sworn last night that that lining was in the bag.
This morning, he turned me down cold.
Guess you'll have to charge this one up to me, Pop.
What've you got to do with it?
You mean that stuff in the hotel.
No, it's something more than that.
Something else has happened.
Yeah, I'm afraid something else has happened.
- What?
- Alexander's daughter.
Oh, no, no.
Pop, I was just sitting there talking.
In her house?
Where would you think we were?
In a bar?
Oh, Johnny, not in South America.
- Not in South America.
- North America, South America.
I was just sitting there talking.
My arm happened to be...
- Don't tell me any more.
- There wasn't any more!
- Johnny, we're dead.
- We are not.
Alexander has no right to mix personalities with business.
If he doesn't know it,
I'll tell him so and right now.
His daughter's one thing.
Business is another.
You'll only make it worse.
That'd be a good trick.
Take a look at that tunnel.
However, if the downward load is equaled by the active upward pressure...
One moment, Ricky.
Let me make myself perfectly clear... to you and to your consulting engineers.
I do not risk men's lives to make money for my stockholders.
Not only is it bad business but I call it murder.
Now, do we or do we not need a concrete lining for that tunnel?
I've been trying to explain for the past...
I am not interested in explanations.
Do we or do we not need a concrete lining for that tunnel?
- Yes or no?
- No.
Do you agree, gentlemen?
Yes, Mr. Alexander, we do.
Mr. Munroe is still waiting, sir.
Yes, I know. Let him wait.
Are there any other matters that need discussion while we're all together?
Mr. Alexander is still in conference.
You will have to wait.
Lady, how wrong you can be.
I don't know whether you gentlemen realize it or not... but I got a railroad to build.
When I come in here to talk, it's because I've got something to say.
Last Sunday, my partner asked you for a concrete lining.
Today, he tells me it's still under consideration.
Well, for your information... while you've been considering,
20 ton of rock decided not to wait.
Fortunately, it missed the gang.
If it were to happen again... there'd be a lot of us in a very embarrassing situation.
That shouldn't worry you particularly,
Mr. Munroe.
That is my naive way of telling you that while you're talking... a few hundred people are risking their lives unnecessarily.
I know the lining isn't in the contract.
But it isn't a matter of contract, it's a matter of common decency.
That again, Mr. Munroe, should give you little cause for concern.
As one engineer to another, may I ask you a question?
Why not? As an engineer,
I respect you.
Then why not take it for granted that only necessity would bring me in here?
I've always been opposed to that tunnel.
A bridge is a better way but you say it can't be done.
And the stockholders agree with you.
Okay, but I won't kill a man for every hundred foot of tunnel.
And I won't drive through
El Tormento without concrete.
Won't or can't?
- What do you mean by that?
- Just what I said.
If you're afraid of the mountain, say so.
Terminate your contract right now.
We'll get somebody else to do the job.
If you'd get out on the job once in a while, you might find out... that slide rules don't hold up rock.
Mr. Munroe, for your information, let me tell...
I've heard enough discussion.
The matter will remain under consideration.
I'd suggest you confirm your opinion, Ricky... by a further examination of the tunnel.
That will be all, gentlemen.
Please wait a minute, Mr. Munroe.
I'm going to.
Why don't you leave Tenango?
I got a railroad to build.
Do you expect to finish it?
Right on schedule.
You're either a fool or an optimist.
Are we talking about a railroad or Miss Alexander?
That's impertinent.
- It makes a difference, you know.
- Does it?
I happen to have a partner named
Pop Mathews. Why take it out on him?
You trying to give me a reason why I shouldn't break you?
- Break me?
- Yes.
Break you.
Wait, Mr. Munroe.
I'm gonna build your railroad, mister.
When I'm finished with it... you can take it and wrap it around your neck for a lavaliere.
Get out of the way, pigeons.
Flowers, mister?
- Hello.
- Hello.
That's what we said last time and look what happened.
- I'm sorry.
- That I said hello?
This time, no tunnels.
No railroads.
No rivers.
- Just you.
- Just me and you.
And Miss Braithwaite.
Does she know about the other night?
Does she approve?
I wouldn't be here if she hadn't helped.
Would she help you again?
I know, in South America, sometimes we wait six months before the first visit.
- But in six months, I might be in...
- China, Tibet or Brooklyn.
If I were, wouldn't be any further away from you than I am right now.
- Why?
- Because your father doesn't like me.
And if he doesn't want me to see you, well, that's that.
Don't I have anything to say about it?
Everything.
I can't say it now.
Well, then save it.
Save it till next week.
- I'll be here. Same time, same place...
- And if I'm not?
Well, then I'll understand that you'd rather not see me.
But I hope you do.
Thank you.
Hey.
- What's this?
- From the man in the jeep.
- See what I mean?
- Yes.
But I'm afraid your father wouldn't.
Hey, Johnny, I'm still waiting on those
12-by-12s. Do I get them or not?
- Did you call the lumber company?
- I did, gave me a quick brush.
Something about a prior order for the Durango mines.
Durango? That Alexander's outfit.
I don't know who owns it but they're getting our timber.
- About that...
- I know, you want more roof.
- I can't build something I haven't got.
- Why tell me? I'm in no hurry.
- Since when?
- Well, I can't blast without dynamite... which I ain't got on account of it's all going to Durango.
- The man on the phone says.
- They're tying us up in knots.
Timber, powder, three carloads of pipe on a siding at Santa Rosa.
The railroad says we can't have it for three weeks.
And Alexander owns the railroad.
Well, you'll just have to make do with what you've got until...
We ain't got until you get.
All right then, I'll get.
Railroad, pipe, lumber.
Timber. Alexander.
Hello, you big mug.
- I don't get it.
- Oh, come on.
Shake anyway, I'm trying to apologize.
For calling yourself an engineer?
No, for not talking things over with Maura... before I jumped you at the office last week.
- Come on. They wanna be alone.
- Yeah, this is strictly love stuff.
Me, I like love stuff.
Don't forget the timber.
And don't forget to keep squawking for it.
- Does this go on all the time?
- Yeah.
Only today it's worse.
Alexander's holding up everything.
- Pipe, timber...
- Well, you asked for a fight, Johnny.
- You're getting it.
- From you too?
No, not since Maura told me she invited you into the house.
Wait a minute. Don't think I ran away.
What's more,
I'm gonna see her again today.
- Go ahead. It's your neck.
- Where do you stand?
Right in the middle, at present.
I've told you what I think about the lining.
I'll take another look at the tunnel.
If I'm wrong, I'll say so.
And to Alexander.
You're wrong.
- Come on, Chico.
- Hey, don't forget, I need gumdrops.
Plenty of them, soft.
Okay. Get in.
And that jeep's just about fresh out of gas.
Come on. Get in.
- Can I see a movie?
- You're a cinch.
I hope there is no love stuff.
What's the matter with love stuff?
He kisses her. She kisses him.
They get married. Kids, trouble.
Hi, Pop.
Ricky, you're a nice guy.
I just feel sorry for that big mug.
No, Frederick, I wouldn't think of Europe for another year or two.
Why don't you stay here in Las Palmas?
Look what you have here, Frederick.
The mountains, the climate, agreeable companions... and yet you are only 30 miles from Tenango.
That's not what I want, Señora.
For five long years, Maura and I have been unable to travel... cut off by the war from any way of living other than our own.
It's very confining.
Oh, Maura, dear, we were talking about the trip to Europe.
- You're going to Europe?
- We"re both going.
- Hadn't I talked to you?
- No.
I must be getting old.
I think of something, then imagine that I've discussed it.
- You're interested, aren't you?
- Not particularly.
I don't blame you, Maura.
Unless it is the Riviera.
There is always Paris.
- I've been to Paris.
- These blasé young people.
May as well say that you have read a book.
When Maura was this age, she was easier to amuse.
Travel was an adventure to her then.
Maura, we're waiting.
We're going down to the lake.
Don't wait for me. I'll meet you later.
Aren't you going to ride?
No, we're taking our exercise at the bridge table today.
And don't quote rules to me.
I have my own system.
- I'm not going to Europe.
- Aren't you?
And I'm not going to stay here in Las Palmas.
I wish I could understand your attitude this past week.
- It puzzles me.
- Does it?
I've gone out of my way to try and please you.
Invited a houseful of guests when I'd much rather be alone.
- Entertained a dozen of your friends.
- Your friends, not mine.
There you are, Maura.
Twenty-odd years, they've been our friends.
Now, suddenly they become my friends.
What is it, Maura? What's wrong?
It's simply that I prefer Tenango to Las Palmas.
You used to like Las Palmas.
The trails we rode together.
Do you remember the day when we made time stand still... looked out from the top of that mountain and said:
"This is good.
This is now. Let's enjoy it together.
Because tomorrow or the next minute, who knows what may happen?”
Has it happened, Maura?
Are we so far apart that we can no longer understand each other?
I want you to understand.
- I want you to understand that...
- Yes?
I just want to see him.
That is something
I do not propose to discuss.
And I'm to stay in Las Palmas?
Until we leave for Europe, yes.
Is that understood?
You handled that very badly, Maura.
I wasn't trying to handle anything.
I told him the truth.
But so have I, often.
And found it's a mistake.
Truth to him is... something he wants to believe.
Then he'd better start to believe... that I'm going to see Johnny Munroe.
When?
I'm supposed to be at the cathedral this afternoon.
I'm afraid you're not going to be.
Ellen, you're dressed for town.
You call the garage while I change.
Ask Pablo to have the car ready for us in 20 minutes.
Wait, Maura.
Give me the garage, please.
Pablo, have Miss Alexander's car ready in 20 minutes, please.
We're driving to Tenango.
I see. Thank you.
Well?
Your father has just left orders that you're not to have the use of the car... without his permission.
Without his permission.
Lock the doors. Close the gates.
Post armed men on the walls.
It's ridiculous!
But very effective.
Then suggest something.
I can, but it will sound even more ridiculous.
Well, say it.
First, don't argue with your father now.
You can't win, Maura.
How am I going to get to Tenango?
It's 30 miles away.
It's less than 20 if you ride.
You can spend the night at the town house.
Have your argument with your father when he arrives in the morning.
At least, you"ll have had your meeting at the cathedral.
And I'll stay in Tenango tonight, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, until.
Oh, Ellen, darling, I love you.
Oh, get out of here.
Be careful, darling.
See messages?
- Did you get the gumdrops for Pop?
- Yes.
How many of them did you eat?
That's all I got.
What took you so long?
I met a woman.
Well, you're luckier than I am.
Sometimes, they don't show up.
That's right. Sometimes they don't.
Excuse me, Señor.
Will you stand up, please?
- Six-foot-three, four, five?
- Four.
You must be the one.
Señorita Maura had to go to Las Palmas.
If she was my woman,
I would go to Las Palmas.
But I would rather go to a movie.
You're going to a movie, Chico.
And I'm going to Las Palmas.
But I will have more fun.
- Where's Maura?
- I don't know.
- Didn't she come back with you?
- We didn't see her.
- She didn't go out to the lake.
- That's odd.
I wonder what's keeping her.
- You're sure she's riding?
- Yes.
Don't be so mysterious about it.
Where did she go?
Tenango.
Rode to Tenango? And you let her?
Give me the town house, please.
Maura is in an adventurous mood today.
She decided to ride to Tenango.
Why? I don't know.
Thomas, has Miss Alexander arrived?
No, that's all. Thank you.
She's not at the town house.
Call my house, Frederick.
If she takes the short way, she must ride through my grounds.
Velarde will have to unlock the gate for her.
I've made that ride. And about there, you start getting tired.
Velarde will drive her home for dinner.
Thank you.
Velarde says she has not been through the grounds.
She should be in Tenango by now.
Tell Velarde to mount a dozen men, all that are there.
Have them ride toward Las Palmas.
This can be serious.
I would not like to spend the night in those hills, I can tell you.
Emilio, don't stand there looking at me.
Tell the grooms to saddle the horses.
Yes, sir.
- With your permission.
- Of course.
I'm coming with you.
And Chico says, "If she was my woman,
I would go to Las Palmas.”
So you went to Las Palmas and found me going to Tenango.
Is that bad?
No, I think it's good.
For everybody except the mare.
- What happens to her?
- She'll be all right.
She"ll eat and visit with some other horses. and then when night comes, she'll go back to the barn.
She'd better get back before night or she'll get herself a bad name.
Particularly here in South America.
Why, what's wrong with South America?
What's wrong with it?
Nothing's wrong with it.
Some of the nicest people I know come from South America.
You're lucky.
Some of the nicest people I know come from North America.
That is the way little girls with blue eyes get themselves kissed.
And that's how big boys with gray eyes get their faces slapped.
Difficult, huh?
Well, I guess I'll have to buy myself a guitar... and give you romance
South American fashion.
I give up. Say anything you want to.
Why?
You won't believe me anyway.
I've run out of gasoline.
Johnny.
Well, Pop told me about it too and I just forgot.
I had a date with a girl and I guess I got excited.
You got excited?
What do you think will happen when I don't arrive in Tenango?
Well, you'll arrive in Tenango all right.
But you're gonna be awful tired when we get there.
Come on, sad eyes, we're gonna walk.
Romance, North American fashion.
- Where are you going?
- Tenango, this way, there's a short cut.
- But we'll get pretty wet.
- No, around the lake.
Then we run into a trail.
- How much shorter is it?
- About seven miles.
Julio, you and your men take the trail here.
We'll meet you at Rocas.
- At the crest?
- At the ruins, the old temple.
Jose, take your men south.
We'll circle and meet you.
- At the old temple?
- Yes.
This is the longest short cut I ever took.
- Are you sure this is the right way?
- Very sure.
You don't have to be very sure.
I'm not arguing.
I came this way with my grandfather Manuel.
He made the trail himself.
All due respect to the grandpa Manuel, this isn't exactly a four-lane highway.
Well, you're supposed to be on a horse.
I was, anyway.
- When was that?
- Ten years.
Ten years? Hold it.
You know, things can happen in ten years.
Hunks of mountain fall down, people get...
Things happen to people.
Is that my fault?
Yes.
No.
What's the matter?
We're on the wrong trail.
Well, when did you decide that?
This is the Inca temple. We should've taken the other way back at the falls.
Back at the falls? That's miles.
And I was so positive.
- Any suggestions?
- No.
Well, then I guess I take over from here. Agreed?
Well, what are we going to do?
Park here for a while, rest our bones and catch a breath.
But we mustn't wait too long.
Oh, no. We'll have a nice quiet dinner.
Then we'll dance a while...
Don't get excited.
Don't get excited. We're paying guests.
Squawk louder next time.
Johnny, I'm worried.
You don't realize what will happen if I don't get to Tenango.
Oh, you'll get there.
There she goes.
Nice.
Nice.
I've gotta get home. I've just got to.
Everything is gonna be all right.
Quit worrying.
I can't help it.
- If we could only get back to the road.
- Which we can't.
Wouldn't be so good groping around in that jungle in the dark.
Well, what can we do?
Well... first, we'll build a fire.
- Yes?
- And... then we'll sit around and watch it burn.
- Till daylight.
- Till daylight?
I couldn't possibly stay here all night.
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to.
Then at the first crack of dawn, when we can see
I'll rush you home just as fast as I can.
- This is serious.
- You bet it's serious.
If you hadn't been raised the lady that you are...
I'd have you out gathering wood... instead of standing there getting panicky.
There's nothing like work to take your mind off your troubles.
I'll help.
Well, don't wear yourself out.
You're not geared for this sort of thing.
Might surprise you.
Well, that would be awfully nice.
But just the same,
I'd hate to see you really roughing it.
No offense, understand.
Dinner.
Sit down. Let's eat.
- Eat?
- Sure, or aren't you hungry?
- Famished, but...
- Have a gumdrop on Pop.
Sorry, there's only one flavor.
Johnny, I'm so...
Close your eyes.
Close them.
Now, what do you see?
Father. And he's perfectly furious.
Well... we really won't have to worry about that... because if we see Papa, I'll just say:
"Mr. Alexander,
I know this doesn't exactly look... "
And he"ll say, "Good night, Mr. Munroe."”
And that'll be that.
Close your eyes.
There's a fire at the old temple.
Señor Tobar must have ridden fast.
Or perhaps it's Señor Avila.
We'll find out.
Hey.
I just made a wish.
- For a fact, now?
- I wished that.
Yes?
If I tell you, it won't come true.
Was I in it?
Well, yes. I think so.
Well, if I made a wish, you'd be in it for sure.
You see those two stars up there?
The ones ever so close together?
- See them?
- Yes.
Well, they're called...
You're not looking in the right direction.
Oh, yes, I am.
Oh, Johnny.
Didn't I tell you it'd be all right?
How I dread tomorrow.
You dreaded tonight.
Yes, I did, terribly.
And now I wish it would never end.
I feel kind of like that too.
Making another wish?
Sleepy.
Good night.
What is it?
Pedro, Miguel, give them your horses.
I don't suppose there's any use trying to explain this time either.
Give them your horses.
No rice.
Johnny, I'm sorry it couldn't have happened differently.
I'm glad it happened the way it did.
I thought it would take a month.
Dispensations, bands.
I didn't know it was possible to get married so quickly down here.
Oh, Maura.
Hasn't it ever occurred to you that I'm in love with you?
You've only seen me a few times.
Once is enough.
I mean it.
That's the way it happened last time.
You've been in love before?
Sure. I can remember it like it was only yesterday.
I opened my eyes and there I was in her arms.
She put me over her shoulder and burped me.
Bakes wonderful pies.
You'll meet her in a month.
Oh, honey, don't worry.
I won't let anything happen to you.
From now on, you're mine. Forever.
What is that?
It comes from my camp.
And it's not good.
They only blow it when there's trouble.
Step on it.
Come on, kick it along.
Where were you?
I called the hotel, the yard...
- What happened?
- The roof went, the whole mountain fell.
- How many inside?
- The night gang, all of them.
Señor Munroe, Señor Munroe, my man is in there!
We're gonna do the best we can, Maria.
Just be patient, all of you.
Please.
Señor Johnny, my father, he's...
I know, I forgot you. I'll see your dad and square it with him.
But he's in there.
We'll get him out. Don't worry, kid.
Maura... Take her up to my shack, will you, Chico?
- Stay with him.
- But I wanna stay here.
Don't argue, stay with him.
I will take you to his house.
No, Chico. If your father is in there, we'll wait.
He will be in there for a long time.
Fire in the hole!
So when the day gang come out, ll shot the bench.
An hour, later she went.
- Ricky's in there with Pop?
- At the heading.
But that stuff looked good. It'll hold.
- Fog?
- He worries me.
If he was on his way out, that fall got him right in the chest.
- Where are you gonna shoot next?
- We"re going in over the top.
Mac, get me a tin hat.
You got that air line ready?
It's all set. A 2-inch lead off the main.
Are you gonna shoot that thing... or are you gonna let those rocks wear away?
Am I gonna shoot it?
In the cool of the evening, he arrives and starts giving orders.
- And glad you are that he does.
- All clear.
Bring the air line in.
Did you see what he brought with him?
A case of bourbon, I hope.
- Alexander's daughter.
- Alexander's...
I told you to keep out of this powder smoke.
You just bought yourself a cheap jag.
Take a look.
- Hey, out of the way.
- Out of the way.
Dames, dames, always it's dames.
Which brings us back to Fog.
Pick it up, pick it up. It won't bite you.
They must be through by now.
If they were through, you would hear the women.
It sometimes takes two days, maybe three.
Three days? They'll all be dead.
Johnny Munroe said he would get them out.
You want another blanket for your bed?
No, no.
I can't stay here.
I've got to go to the tunnel.
He'll beat you, and you"ll deserve it.
Give me that sledge.
Cut off that air for a minute!
Cut the air!
Tell the women.
Come on, let's dig.
They answered our signals.
Your men are alive.
- How long will it be, how long?
- An hour, maybe sooner.
I tell you, your men are alive.
Chico, get home and heat up those beans.
Your old man's gonna be hungry.
He will not want beans.
You're Mrs. Munroe, aren't you?
I'm Curly Messinger, master mechanic.
You sure got a good guy.
- What's he doing in there?
- We hit a pocket, sort of a room.
Some men are there.
We don't know how many.
Johnny and Joe are holing through now.
Why don't you go up to his place and wait there?
- I'll send him as soon as he comes up.
- Can he get hurt?
Hurt? He's too ugly to get hurt.
He is like that. He laughs.
Always laughs. He is nice.
I think I can get through there.
I know I can get through for sure.
Fog! Fog!
Yeah.
Well, what kept you?
- Touchy little guy.
- How about these others?
They conked out right away.
Give me your hand.
- Johnny.
- They'll be all right.
They're still alive.
His legs.
Doc.
They're both asleep.
How about Pop and Ricky?
You got me, Johnny.
In there someplace.
Tell Curly to get on the ball and get the rest of that crew in here.
Come on, Joe.
Don't drink all the brandy in the hospital.
They'll be all right.
What is it? What do you want?
Why did you let me sleep?
Excuse me, Señora, but your were tired.
They've found them.
They are safe, everyone.
And you let me sleep.
There is time.
They just come from the tunnel now.
It is better that you wait here.
See your man alone.
Always they talk.
After such things, men talk and drink.
If no one is dead, they are happy.
- Your father?
- He's all right, not hurt.
There's coffee and beans on the stove.
I'll go out the back way.
Never mind about the tunnel.
I wanna know about Alexander's daughter and right now.
Be a good guy and go get that skull of yours patched up.
- I'll tell you later.
- Never mind that skull of mine.
I can still think with it, more than you can do.
I haven't slept for two days.
Give me a break, will you?
Give you a break?
Ll ought to break your nose for you.
Can you imagine anything so stupid?
Marries Alexander's daughter.
The guy is nuts.
At least he's original.
My face feels as if somebody stepped on it. Which you did, Pop.
See you all later.
Not if I see you first, you won't.
Hello, baby.
That's what I need.
Tough night.
Are you hurt?
Just tired.
You're sweet, baby.
Just sweet.
- All ready, Señora.
- Thank you.
All that food for just two people?
He is much of a man, this man of yours, Señora.
Yes, he is.
Hey, Maria. What are we gonna have for breakfast?
Eggs, fried.
When are we gonna have something different?
Tomorrow, boiled.
Eggs fried, eggs boiled, eggs scrambled.
Seems like a man could have something else besides eggs.
What, for instance?
You.
Pretty baby.
I... I guess I'm gonna have to learn some new manners.
I'm so used to having the bedroom in the dining room.
- Dining room in the bedroom.
- I don't mind.
You don't?
I'll take four of them.
- Four?
- And some bacon.
My lord and master.
Four of them and plenty of bacon.
Hey, Johnny.
Johnny, the blower's gone haywire, ll can't use the gas shovel in the tunnel.
- Oh, good morning, Miss...
- Good morning.
- Mrs. Munroe.
- You had to reach for that one, Pop.
- All right?
- Yes, yes, she's very lovely.
We're hung up there. Come take a look.
- I haven't eaten yet.
- Eat later.
- Let me have a cup of coffee.
- Bring your coffee.
It's important. You don't mind, do you?
- Take your coffee while you walk.
- Well, I.
Put a cover on the eggs, will you, honey?
I'll be back in two minutes.
Every morning, it is the same.
I cook eggs.
Something happens. He goes away.
I have to eat them. I hate eggs.
All right, Joe. I'll get them.
Don't worry.
Fog, where's the timbers?
I'll get timbers.
Don't worry.
I'll get them, Joe.
Maura...?
I'm here.
- What time is it?
- After 7.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I've asked you not to do this.
You came in late. I let you sleep.
Has Pop been here yet?
I told him he could see you at 8.
Not before.
But I told him to be here at 6, honey.
We're stuck for rails.
The track foreman will blow his top.
All right. Let him blow his top.
Maria, get me some coffee.
- Where's Maria?
- She isn't here today.
- I'm making your breakfast.
- Oh, well...
Oh, but you needn't take time to eat it.
I wouldn't know what to do with you around.
I never see you.
- Never?
- Almost never.
You're gone before I'm awake in the mornings.
Ten minutes at lunch then 10 minutes again at dinner.
Back into that crazy mountain.
But I do see you a few moments at night.
But at night, you frighten me.
You talk, talk, talk in your sleep.
Last night, you sat up in bed and called:
"Curly, look out, look out.
The roof is falling.”
You talk to Joe, you talk to Fog.
You talk to everybody but me.
Oh, honey. I...
Johnny, it's an insane way to live.
You mean you're sorry we tried it?
Don't be.
Just three more months.
- Promise?
- Just three more months.
Hello, Ricky.
Hello, Johnny. Hello, Maura.
You're just in time for breakfast.
My breakfast.
I gotta hurry.
- See you later.
- Bye, Johnny.
What happens in three more months?
This job will be finished and we're going to his country.
In three months?
I'm going to meet his mother.
And there's a barn with... a thing that you slide down.
I don't know where you land, but he says it's wonderful.
Come on, sit down.
I'll fix you some breakfast.
In three months, huh?
- Want your coffee first?
- Yes, please.
I don't know where you two get your figures.
If Johnny gets through with this in a year, he'll be lucky.
You don't know my Johnny.
You should come around more.
He's working night and day to finish.
You're father's working to see that he doesn't.
You mean about the deliveries of the timber and pipe and things?
Johnny's fixed that.
We got a whole carload of pipe yesterday.
Want some beans? I made them.
He got one carload. He needed three.
Don't you understand what your father's doing?
If he wanted to, he could close this down tomorrow.
He owns the railroad.
Then why did we get all that pipe yesterday?
Did you ever see a cat play with a mouse?
Stops him, let's him go.
Stops him, let's him go.
Little by...
Does he hate me that much?
I don't know, Maura.
I do know this much.
That Johnny will be lucky if he ever gets this job done.
Let alone in three months.
Johnny said three months, Ricky.
And I believe him.
Bring the sandwiches, Chico.
I don't like the sandwiches.
Only the middle of them.
What good's a picnic without sandwiches? Bring them.
All right, Señora. But you will have to eat the bread... while I eat what goes between.
Oh, not today.
Nothing must happen today.
We've waited and planned so long.
Maybe it is nothing important.
And there is always tomorrow.
Yes, always tomorrow, never today.
This time, it is Pop Mathews.
- Is Johnny hurt?
- No, just Mathews.
Lots of rock fell on him. Oh, it's bad.
Give me the hospital. Yes, the hospital.
This is Chavez at the tunnel.
We have a man for the operating room.
- Is he bad?
- Bad enough.
He's got a couple of ribs stove in.
When you see Alexander... tell him to open a bottle of wine, he's out in front today.
He got a good guy.
Why tell me? I'm on your side.
Who said I wanted you on my side?
You or any of the rest of your tribe.
For my dough, you're all a bunch of...
I'm sorry, Maura. l... Sometimes l...
I'm sorry.
We gotta get Pop to the hospital.
Doesn't he know that l love Pop too?
He didn't think, Maura.
Sometimes I wonder how he can think at all.
Three months.
Just three more months.
Prayers, prayers.
You women pray too much.
What else is there for us to do?
I don't know. But sometimes, I think you must weary the saints.
Perhaps, but they've kept him alive,
Chico.
And it won't be long until we'll be leaving this place.
Always you talk of going away.
What is wrong with this?
I hate it.
That is because you're a woman.
Women don't understand such things.
Tell Curly both foot valves are plugged solid at the river.
Hello, Maura. And tell him I'm waiting.
Hop up to the shack and get me some dry clothes, will you?
That river is cold.
Bring me some cigarettes.
Thanks.
- What's for supper?
- Boiled beef, I suppose.
Good. I'm hungry.
When did you start this?
A month ago. Hadn't you noticed?
You better cut in on that emergency line.
We'll need some water after this shot.
What did Chavez say about that carload of rails?
I've been smoking for a month.
You have?
Pete, they're waiting on that switch and runaround. Catch him up.
With what? I'm stuck for track.
Didn't you tell Chavez to send a truck for those rails?
- I haven't seen Chavez.
- But, Maura, this morning at breakfast.
I didn't see you at breakfast.
Well, then yesterday or last night or sometime. Why...
Go on, make do with what you've got.
- I'll get your rails tonight.
- Okay.
- Why don't you do what I tell you?
- But, Johnny.
It wouldn't have taken five minutes to talk to Chavez.
If you don't wanna do it, why don't you say so?
Hey, that's beautiful.
I like it. New?
No.
I like it.
Right there.
Now, look at you.
I don't mind, Johnny.
I just wanna find out when we're going away from here.
It won't be long, baby.
You don't need these.
They'll stunt your growth.
- How long?
- Oh, 30, 60 days.
Jose, get down to the river.
Give them a hand with those filters until Curly comes.
- You said that last month.
- And I meant it.
Take a couple of men from the power house to help you.
We"re over the hump, Maura.
Almost through the bad rock.
Tonight, tomorrow, maybe two more blasts.
- And we'll be out in the clear.
- What then?
Going all the way through the mountain.
Thirty, 60 days tops.
Thirty days. Sixty days.
You've said all that before.
Three months ago, you promised... we'd be on our way to the States this week.
I've waited. I've believed you.
I've tried to make myself live in this crazy world of yours.
- I can't do it, Johnny., ll can't, I can't!
- Stop it, Maura.
Dirt, noise, men getting killed.
If I stay here any longer, I'll go insane!
- Do you hear me?
- Stop that.
- Won't, I won't!
- Stop that nonsense!
Don't I have enough headaches around here... without you blowing your top?
You said three months.
Yes, I said three months, and I meant three months.
That was before your old man started throwing the book at me.
No track, no timber, no pipe.
What do you expect me to build this thing with, spit and chewing gum?
If you told me you could,
I'd believe you.
All right, then believe this, Maura.
I'm doing everything I can.
I can't do any more.
And if you love me, stop nagging at me.
Leave me alone when I'm working.
Get four cases of powder and a box of exploder. Fast.
- Come on, you guys.
- The roof went at the heading.
- What about that shoulder?
- It's all right.
- How much came down?
- Just enough, we're through.
What? This isn't the first time we've lost a roof.
This isn't the first, this is the last.
We got rock from the heading to Harlem.
- It'll take a year to dig it out.
- Then we'll dig for a year.
Don't give me that "through” stuff.
- I'm not kidding.
- I'm not either.
I'll drive that tunnel if it takes
50 years.
If the going is getting too tough for you... draw your pay and scram?
Don't give me that "through” stuff.
- Johnny.
- Oh, go away.
- What do you want?
- Curly.
What about Curly?
- Nothing.
- Let's go.
Get over to the hospital and fix up that shoulder.
Chavez.
What about Curly?
I couldn't tell him.
There's a guy ready to crack, but I mean now.
What happens when he finds Curly under that pile of rock?
- Is Curly dead?
- What else could he be... with a mountain on his chest?
And that guy is going in to clear it out.
- Joe, he can't.
- No, he can't.
But he will.
"Draw your pay and scram.”
If I had any sense, that's what I'd do.
If you had any sense, that's what you'd do.
Why don't you take his advice and get out of here?
How is he?
He's through.
That'll give you a little rest, son.
Yeah. Put you to sleep.
When you wake up, you'll be in a nice clean hospital bed.
We'll get you a nice blond nurse like Fog's got, if you want.
Since when did we start telling each other lies?
Leave it where it is, Johnny.
Leave the whole thing where it is.
You can't drive through this crazy mountain.
Nobody can.
Stop trying, as a favor.
What can I say to that?
You don't say anything, Johnny.
You just take those swell plans and build yourself that bridge.
Would it make you happy if I said yes?
Be happy.
You"re a great guy, Johnny.
One more favor, while I've still got you on the hook.
Let me stay here, Johnny.
What?
I'm scared of graveyards.
Have been ever since I was a kid.
Curly? Curly?
Mr. Munroe.
- I think we'd...
- Leave him alone.
How many cases of dynamite have you got?
Thirty.
That's funny. That's how old
Curly was on his last birthday.
Yeah.
Plant them all.
All clear?
All clear.
If a guy could write poetry... he'd say that mountain was Curly's monument.
Maura?
- Maura?
- She went home to her father.
She told me to tell you.
- Joe told me about the tunnel.
- He did?
He also told me about the bridge.
- I think I can swing it for you, Johnny.
- Can you?
No need to go into the details now.
I'm sure I can talk Alexander into agreeing it's a good...
I listened to you and compromised with Alexander once before.
Because I did, Curly's dead.
From now on, I listen to no one.
I'll build his railroad for him, but I'll do it my own way.
Get out.
All right, Johnny.
I'm sorry, Chico.
You'd better go on home.
What time was it when Maura came home last night?
- Well after midnight.
- Why didn't you wake me?
She asked me not to.
So she's left him.
- Come home to stay?
- Yes.
Well, that settles that.
- Be sure and say, "I told you so.”
- I probably shall.
Will you excuse us please, Ellen?
That's all, Clara.
It's good to see you, Maura.
Well... you've done just what you set out to do.
Sit down Maura.
You're upset, I can understand that.
But, I think, if we discuss this quietly and sensibly for a few moments...
How does it feel to be responsible for the death of a man?
What man?
The man who died in the tunnel yesterday.
You did that.
Just as you've done everything.
You marry your daughter off to a man... and then put the whole world between them.
And it's so easy for you.
Just pick up a phone, call this one, call that one.
No timber, no rails.
You, yes, you killed Curly Messinger.
That is a very serious accusation,
Maura.
And untrue.
They asked you for a concrete lining, and you refused to give it to them.
I'm not in the habit of defending my decisions, Maura.
But since you appear to entertain some ridiculous notions... you should know that not only Ricky... but six other responsible engineers decided that it was unnecessary.
I agreed with them.
And when he signed the contract, so did the man you married.
But he came to you later and told you that...
Now look here, Maura.
No one forced Munroe and Mathews to build that railroad.
Many other firms wanted the contract but your husband's bid was the lowest.
The work was started.
Then, out of a clear sky, he insisted on a concrete lining.
- But he proved he was right.
- After the damage was done.
He could have closed down the work at any time, you know.
You knew he wouldn't do that.
Then what made him think that I would quit?
Does he judge all the Alexanders by the one he married?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.
I quit. I ran away.
Let us say instead that you've come home.
That Munroe and everything connected with him is a part of yesterday.
Mr. Munroe is in the library.
- What does he want?
- He's closed down the tunnel.
Having failed with the tunnel...
I suppose he's come to ask to try his hand at building a bridge, is that it?
Something like that.
Sorry to be so abrupt.
But I'm in a hurry.
Excuse me, please.
Have you been drinking?
Quite steadily. There are the specifications for the bridge.
Look them over tonight and okay them.
I wanna get started in the morning.
And you expect me to put my signature on these papers?
- What makes you think that I will?
- You have no alternative.
Mountain's come down on your tunnel and every cent you've invested in it.
If there's a railroad to the mines, it will go over a bridge.
Which some other contractor will build.
I doubt it.
I'll build the bridge for the remainder of the funds set aside for the tunnel.
- And in the same time.
- You're insane.
Your stockholders won't think so.
As long as I bring in the railroad at the original cost.
Particularly now that your tunnel has proven itself a failure.
Why don't you admit that you're beaten, Munroe?
When do I start the bridge?
Sleep on it.
You look charming, Miss Braithwaite.
I like the way you've done your hair.
- How's it going, Holden?
- There's a big beef on down there.
The guys are squawking about rock dust.
Silicosis, miner's consumption.
They want water in the holes to wet it down.
Dry holes drill faster.
Tell them no water.
I did. One of those guys went to school.
- He knows the law.
- Fire him.
The others won't like it.
- That's your headache, Holden.
- Okay.
But how about this traveler?
We're overloading, sooner or later, she's gonna let go.
So we'll lose a little sand and cement.
In the meantime, we'll save a hundred working hours.
Yeah, but who takes the rap for the men we lose?
Does that worry you?
The men, no. But the rap, yes.
I hired you because they told me you were tough.
- And could get the work done.
- They didn't tell you wrong.
Well then, get the work out.
I'll take care of the raps.
Hey, Joe. What's holding up the shot?
Waiting for your new boss to pull his gang out.
He's not gonna pull them out.
Kick it off.
- They're too close.
- Not the way I look at it.
Fire in the hole.
Crawl under your tin hats.
That's what they're for.
Don't ever do that again, Johnny.
Not while I'm blaster.
- Don't you like it?
- No.
Why don't you quit?
I'm sticking around to see how rotten a guy can get.
Okay, stick around.
But that's the way it's gonna be, Joe.
Maybe a little tougher.
Well, maybe you ought to get closer to the men.
You might see things better.
Come on.
That's popping them kind of close, isn't it?
You too?
I didn't know you were interested in construction.
- Shall I explain a few of the details?
- That won't be necessary.
I built the railroad that brought you into Tenango.
- Engineered it too.
- I didn't know you were an engineer.
There are many things that you don't know about me.
You'll have to admit that I'm learning fast.
How does it strike you?
The bridge is coming along all right.
But you're cheating on each and every factor of safety.
You're cutting some dangerous corners, Munroe.
I'm building you a bridge.
When it's finished, you can decide whether it's good... before you pay off.
But the methods I use to build it are my business.
There happen to be one or two other people interested in this venture.
I'm not referring to the board of directors.
- You're worried about them?
- Frankly, yes and about you too.
You readily understand, Munroe, it's not easy for me to say this.
I've never been an admirer of yours.
But somehow recently
I've come to see you differently.
Strange, you look just the same to me as always.
Don't be a fool, Munroe.
I know this country, know it well.
When the rains come, the river rises eight, 10, sometimes 15 feet.
I've seen it roaring down this canyon like a mad thing in flight.
- Don't cheat on your foundations, man.
- They'll be good.
Make them better.
Use steel in your span if necessary.
I'll give you a 90-day extension, if you like.
But do a good job.
You'll give me a 90-day extension?
You gave me a wedding once.
Since then I've been very careful what I accept from the Alexanders.
Thanks, I'm not interested.
Señor Fog, you have come back to us.
- It is good to see you again.
- It's good to be back, Chavez.
Take my advice and stay out of hospitals.
Senor Johnny will be happy to see you.
You walk good with three legs.
What did they bring that guy back for?
- Who are those guys?
- Strangers, Holden has brought them.
- This is not a happy camp.
- What are you...?
- Hey, sure been building bridge.
- Yeah.
I'd better have a closer look at this.
I hope he will say something to Johnny Nunroe.
Maybe things will be better.
- Hi, Pop, remember me?
- Well, welcome home, roughneck.
Hey, you look swell. Positively lady bait.
Yeah, that's what the nurses said.
That all you got to do?
Putter with that paper work?
Yeah, I guess that's what you'd call it.
Puttering.
Hey, what do you think of it?
Come on, take a look.
Hey, you didn't tell me you were this far along.
Yesterday we weren't.
Hey, Joe.
Look what I've got.
Fog Harris.
Say, isn't there anything I can do to get rid of you?
- What's the idea of the cane?
- Trying to get sympathy.
Hey, you think this thing will stay put when the rains come?
That's something we don't talk about in front of the children.
Let's go.
I'm gonna introduce him to Holden.
Hey, keep on that wire. I'll be right rack.
I've been taking a gander at the way this camp's being run.
When I see Johnny,
I'm gonna ask him some questions.
- Oh, Holden, I want you to meet...
- Fog Harris?
Johnny told me about you.
Get a number from the timekeeper.
Settle for night watchman, you've got yourself a job.
Night watchman? He was boss before he went to the hospital.
I got a job for him. He's gonna be construction boss across the river.
You got a job for him?
Look, Mathews. I didn't wanna give it to you the hard way.
But you're a nuisance. A pest.
I'd have run you off of the job, only Johnny asked me to keep you.
Johnny asked you too keep me around?
If you want it direct, ask him.
Here he is.
Did you ask him to keep me around?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut.
- He's always popping off.
- I told you to keep your mouth shut!
Well, I opened it, so what?
He didn't rate that.
No?
You did. That's from me to you.
For Pop and a lot of swell guys you've stepped on.
I'm building a bridge, Fog.
Do you want a job?
With you?
No, Johnny. I'm writing you off.
I can see just what he means.
And on you, it doesn't look good.
Hey, Buzz!
We're getting a new job.
You too, I suppose.
No, I'm still your partner till I tell you different.
Pancho.
Get up, you're not hurt.
Kind of reminds me of Johnny Munroe.
Yeah, the faster they climb, the sooner they fall.
It isn't all his fault.
Pressing hard to meet a deadline.
Hey.
Chico.
Down the hatch.
I am saying olé for everybody.
Chico, why don't you go out there and be a bullfighter?
Not me, I am an engineer.
- Hello, Serf or Johnny.
- Hello, Chico.
Hello.
- Sorry, sir, you have to have a necktie.
- I have one here.
- What's the matter?
- Hello, Mr. Munroe.
It's independence day, a very important day.
And the dining room is full.
- We"re going to the bar.
- We'll drink our dinner.
Well, the bar is very crowded too.
We'll get along all right.
Good evening, ladies.
- How do you do, Mr. Alexander?
- How do you do, Mr. Moya?
How do you like this guy Munroe?
He's still mooning over that Jane.
- Mister...
- Hello, Ricky.
Hello, Johnny.
You haven't been out at the bridge lately, mad at me?
Are these your friends?
- They're part of my crew.
- Why inflict them on us?
Are you coaxing around for a clout on the ear?
- Why, are you?
- Now, wait a minute.
If anybody's gonna get insulted around here, it'll be me.
Let's just pretend we didn't hear it.
- Seen Johnny?
- Yeah, he's in there somewhere.
- Did he say anything?
- Yeah, he said, "Hello."
- I was talking to Alexander.
- Yes.
Offered you plenty of time.
Wanted to give you a 90-day extension, you kick it.
I'm accepting nothing from Alexander.
No, you'd rather turn the job into a rat race.
You'd rather break with Joe and Fog and bring in slime like this Holden.
Johnny, what are you doing to yourself?
What are you doing?
I've got a fight on my hands, Pop.
Not a nice clean fight where you step up and punch each other on the jaw.
In this one, no holds are barred.
You fight with contracts and telephones and time clauses.
And tomorrow when that last span goes in, I win the first round.
Yeah, you've won a round all right.
And you've lost everything that made you Johnny Munroe.
You used to be a builder. A creator.
Why I've watched those hands dream up roadways... dams and tunnels and bridges.
I've watched them take nothing and make it into something.
I've watched you build things.
And now? Now you've lost all that.
Now you're tearing things down, you're tearing people down.
You aren't building, you're destroying.
So you don't want any more of it.
Is that it?
Yeah, I guess that's it.
When you get back to the job, take my name off the sign.
From now on, it's just Johnny Munroe.
May I talk to you?
- Talk to me?
- Yes.
Well?
It's taken a long time to find the courage to say it, Johnny.
I've wanted to tell you
I was wrong.
- I should never have left you.
- You weren't wrong, Maura.
I don't know how you stuck it out as long as you did.
All that mud, and noise, and dirt, and people getting killed.
It's your life, Johnny.
- I'll get used to it.
- Oh, no, you won't and neither will I.
I found out there's a little thing called money.
And I'm going out after it. Plenty of it.
I'll finish the bridge and I'll keep on working all right.
But it will be for money.
And when I get enough of it,
I'll buy you back.
Let me take you home, Maura.
I'll get the car.
- More fireworks.
- Yeah, nothing like the real thing.
Well, I'm not gonna get my feet wet.
Let's grab a nightcap and hit the hay.
Come on, Chico, we'll buy you a lemonade.
Are you going to see Señor Johnny?
No.
We should be quite proud of ourselves, shouldn't we?
- Proud?
- Yes, proud of what we've done to him.
My dear, let us not take credit for an elemental fact.
Put a man in the jungle and you"ll discover what his real nature is.
The veneer wears pretty thin.
Munroe had very little to begin with.
He was real.
- And for that I loved him.
- Maura.
He was himself then, Johnny.
Not this crazy stranger without friends.
Yes, he stands alone now, doesn't he?
Yes.
All alone.
Yes?
It's Gonzalez at the mine.
He says there's been a cloudburst in the mountains.
A 3-foot wall of water is starting down the river.
Get me the hotel, please.
Thank you, Gonzalez.
- The hotel, please.
- The showdown, Maura.
A little sooner than Mr. Munroe expected.
- That pleases you?
- Frankly, yes.
It was never a question of could he build a bridge.
Any one of a thousand men could have done that.
The question is, will it still be there after the water hits it.
Hello. I wish to speak with Mr. Vegas.
Yes? Yes, sir. Thank you.
I'll tell Munroe at once.
Yes, in your office. Ten minutes.
- Come on, snap out of it, you big ape.
- Snap out of it, snap out of it.
Some more black coffee, Mr. Munroe?
No, it's no use. He's out for the night.
- See if you can find him a...
- Johnny.
There's been a cloudburst.
Three feet of water starting down the river.
My uncle thought you ought to know.
Is he worried about his bridge?
Why shouldn't he be?
He's got an investment.
It'd be worth more than that to him to see it go out.
But it won't, it'll stand 3 feet.
Wave won't be 3 feet when it gets there.
It'll be 6, 8, 10. I've seen it before.
Without that center span in place you're in trouble.
How long before the water'll hit it?
Six hours. The turns in the river slow it till it hits the straightaway, then...
- Hernandez!
- Yes, sir.
- What happened to the others?
- I don't know.
- They're in worse condition than he is.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, where you going?
My crew.
- Chavez!
- Yes, sir.
Break it up, you're gonna get water down this river.
- This is what we've heard.
- What are you waiting for?
Get men on this span and run it out.
Get it in place in a hurry!
The men refuse to go onto the bridge.
They will not risk being here when the flood hits it.
Tell them I'll give them double pay.
Double.
All right, get on those controls and haul in that tram block.
All right.
All right, take me out slow now.
Watch my signals.
What happened?
Chavez, I'm really stuck.
You men have to give me a hand!
Get some crowbars and some heavy chains.
No use. They know the flood is coming.
They know it will knock down the bridge.
That flood won't hit for hours, you know that.
Ten of us can get that thing in place in no time.
Come on, five of you.
A hundred pesos apiece for five.
All right, three of you.
A thousand apiece for three.
Pepe!
Chago.
It is as I warned.
The men have turned away from you.
I am unhappy to tell you this, but perhaps you heard them say it.
If it had been Señor Mathews, or Fog or Joe, the men...
Well...
I guess this is it.
The men are stinkers.
They will not work.
The bridge will all fall down.
That's right, Chico.
All our work and blood and sweat will be blasted into...
That doesn't matter.
I'm tired, Chico. Awful tired.
Good night, Señor Johnny.
I love you, Johnny Munroe.
Don't say it, Maura.
I'm no good.
I've come back to you, Johnny.
You want me, don't you?
That's not it, Maura.
I'm not looking for sympathy.
It's just I...
I'm gonna get out of here.
Are you?
Are you still "gonna get out of here"?
Don't you think you should get back to work on the bridge?
Oh, the bridge.
Oh, it's not that I mind, but Pop and the boys won't like it.
Pop and the...
Well, you can't expect them to do all the work.
Pop and the boys?
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I knew something like this would happen.
- Keep her in line, watch those bars.
- Hey, Fog.
Pop.
Yeah.
- How you...? What can I...?
- Why don't you suit up?
You're all wet, get up and help with that derrick.
Yeah.
And stop slowing down the work.
- Is there room for one more?
- Yeah, pull up a chair.
Hey, Pop, keep the tourists off here.
Wipe that jam off your face.
Steady now, Joe. Down easy.
More right, more right.
Hello, I. Sierra?
Has the crest passed you there yet?
It's coming now, Señor!
Five feet, 6, maybe more.
Six feet at I. Sierra.
How long would it take before it reaches the bridge?
Four hours, perhaps less.
Now we'll see whether this man is all he pretends to be.
Bring on the rail!
Call Lopez, tell him to report.
Lopez, has the flood reached you yet?
The flood.
Yes, Señor Vegas, it is here.
Eight feet at the bend. Still rising.
Ricky's on the phone.
The crest is on its way, coming fast.
- How high?
- Ten, maybe 15 feet.
It's giving everything a haircut from here to the mine.
It won't take a 15-foot wave.
Well, it might take it... if we could get something heavy to weight this down.
Flood will hold off while we go in town and haul out the iron foundry.
- That train is no sack of feathers.
- Wait a minute, Johnny.
You wouldn't use a good work train for ballast?
Tell that crew to get some steam up.
Okay, here goes another slice of Alexander's bankroll.
You'll never get a crew to run her out here.
Well, I can't say as I blame them.
- Hey, get me a good head of steam.
- She has plenty now.
Okay, Johnny!
Okay!
Johnny!
- Señor Johnny.
- Hello, kid.
She's standing the gaff, Johnny.
She's staying put.
At the risk of repeating myself, gentlemen, I have to tell you...
Johnny, I've been trying to tell him you built a good bridge.
But he just won't listen.
All he talks about is you.
A reprehensible, headstrong rascal, gentlemen. A blight on the community.
A hard-rock scoundrel...
So we bid fond farewell to beautiful Tenango.
- Well?
- Maura wanted to say goodbye to you.
We're leaving Tenango, Father.
Goodbye, Maura.
Your happiness means everything to me.
I know now where you will find it.
Goodbye, Munroe.
- You dislike me a lot, don't you?
- More than that.
I dislike you too. Quite sincerely.
That's the beauty of our mutual dislike, sincerity.
By the way, what you've made of that bridge is good.
I trust you will finish it.
The board of directors is waiting to discuss it with you.
Is the luggage ready?
- Is my car here?
- Yes, Frederico.
- Where are you going?
- Where are we going.
Back to a little town in Vermont.
I was there once, I like it very much.
Besides a few months among the simple values... is good for the soul of man, so I'm told.
Back to the green hills of Vermont.
Utopia, really.
Untouched by the ugly works of greedy men.
He's changed.
I don't believe it.
Well, let's face the music.
He has changed.
That bridge can wait.
What bridge? That's our bridge.
This is my honeymoon.
- That can wait.
- The bridge can wait.
Now, wait a minute, Johnny...
IRBY:
Close that door.
Vance.
Lock it.
Why did you risk coming here?
Bradford's downstairs now looking for you.
Yes, I saw him. He found the hideout. Every street leading out of town is blocked...
...with soldiers but we're going tomorrow night and the gold is going with us.
But how can we?
Remember Murrell, the outlaw?
I made a deal with him.
His gang is camped a few miles from here.
Between 2 and 3 tomorrow night, they'll attack the garrison.
That'll draw every soldier out of Virginia City.
When they arrive, we slip out of town with the four wagons.
The others will be up in Box Canyon waiting for us.
Waiting for us?
But you can't stay here now, Julia.
Or would you rather stay?
Why, I have nothing to stay for, Vance.
Of course I'm going with you.
There's just one other thing left to be done, Julia...
...but it's the most important, and you are the only one who can do it.
What is it, Vance?
Get in touch with Bradford, tell him you know where I'm hiding and send him to me.
Send him to you? What for?
He's the one man in Virginia City who could stop us.
The moment he saw us start, he'd arouse a posse to grab us and the gold.
The only way to stop that is to grab him first.
What are you going to do with him,
Vance?
I don't know yet.
You're going to kill him, aren't you?
Of course you are.
You couldn't afford to leave him here alive, he knows too much about us.
So I must lead him quietly and unsuspecting to his death because I'm a woman.
That's something only a woman could do.
Why, all of this was your idea, Julia.
Taking the gold from here.
Remember the look on Jefferson Davis' face when he said:
"We are very proud of you and deeply grateful"?
I remember.
"And the hopes of 10 million of us will be riding with you."
I remember.
That's why your decision right now is so important.
Oh, but why must I be the one, Vance?
Can't you see this is murder?
It's even worse than murder,
Kerry trusts me.
And what about those who are trusting us?
When these people leave with their children...
...they're turning their backs on their homes.
Some of them are facing death and they know it, but not one hesitates.
Yes.
I know what this means to you, Julia...
...but there's no alternative, you are the only one who can do it.
What shall I tell him?
Now, listen...
All right, we'll spread out from here.
Moose, you take the north section.
You men check everything up that way.
Come on, Marble, we'll look around here.
By golly. Ain't a man got time to get a little grog around here?
You're groggy enough, partner. Wait here.
How do you do? I understand this is a boarding house, is that correct?
- We're filled up.
- Well, thanks. I wasn't looking for a room...
...I was looking for a boarder.
Mind telling me who your guests are?
That's their business. I never ask them.
- Well, would you mind if I looked around?
- You can take a look at this.
I'll have no yellow-livered Yankee in my house unless it's a dead one.
And I got a twitchy finger, so get.
Well, do you still want to argue?
No, ma'am. I never argue with women.
And certainly not a woman with a gun.
I'd do something for that twitchy finger if I were you...
...it even makes me nervous. Good day.
So the Union forces retreat, huh?
Yes, sir. The third battle of Bull Run.
MAN: Hey, come back here, you little ragamuffin.
Here he is, sergeant.
COBBY:
Let me go.
- Answer my questions and I'll let you go.
- I can't tell you anything.
You know every rebel in town, you run errands for them. Where's Irby?
- I don't know and I wouldn't tell if I did.
SERGEANT: You're lying.
- I'll wail that tar out if you don't talk.
COBBY: Go ahead, you're big enough.
Hold on, sergeant. Let the kid alone.
- Yes, but...
- I said, let him alone.
Come on, partner.
We're not fishing for Southerners your size.
Yeah, well, I was fishing for you.
- Miss Julia sent me to find you.
- She did?
- What are you fellas butting in for?
- What?
If I had my way, I'd whip that little copperhead until he couldn't stand up.
If you don't find her on the stage, you'll find her in her dressing room.
I see.
- Thanks. Here's something for your trouble.
- No, thanks, I don't want it.
Hey, you don't like Yankees much, do you?
No, I don't.
Well, I think I know how you feel.
When I was a boy in Ireland,
I felt the same way about Englishmen.
But you can change.
Well, thanks all the same.
So long.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Come in.
- Darling, did you send for me?
- Yes.
- The boy said it was urgent.
- It is.
Come over here, Kerry, and sit down by me.
What is it?
Oh, I'm worried about you.
Half of Virginia City knows who you are and why you're here.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, it's part of my job not to talk too much.
- I would have told you at the right time.
- Oh, there'll never be a right time.
I know these Southern people,
I've lived among them.
They'll kill you before they'd give up their gold.
You can hardly blame them for trying.
But they're gonna have to improve their aim first.
You mustn't go on with the search.
Please. For my sake.
But I must go on with it.
This job's gotta be finished.
But what can you, one man, hope to accomplish against hundreds?
You can't stop them, Kerry, the whole Union Army can't stop them.
I love you, darling.
I'm so afraid for you.
I love you too, Julia.
But I won't run out and leave them a clear field here.
I couldn't do it. Don't you see?
This means too much to too many people.
Does it mean more than...?
Than you and me?
It's the only thing that does.
All right, if that's your decision.
I'm sorry, darling.
I want to help you.
I can tell you where to find their leader.
- Who? Irby?
- Yes.
He's in love with one of the girls here.
She saw him less than an hour ago.
- Where is she? Where can I talk to her?
- She'd be afraid to talk to you.
She said that Irby's ready to make a deal, give himself up tonight if you come alone.
- Then he must know he's beaten.
- Yes.
Where is he?
There will be someone here tonight to take you to him.
I see.
How do you know you can trust that girl?
She wouldn't lie to me.
She knows I love you and what your life means to me.
Darling, that's enough for me.
Goodbye.
Tell Carson City to watch the south road, stop all travelers, hold for identification...
[GUNSHOTS]
- What happened?
- It's a raid. About 50 of them.
- We don't know who they are.
- Looks like Murrell and his men.
Close the gates, mount the parapets, a hundred rounds to each man.
We only have a skeleton force, the rest are on patrol.
Burke, go and get them, bring them back as fast as you can.
Lieutenant, assemble what men we have.
We'll hold them off until the reinforcements come.
Wayne...
- There it is.
- Oh, wait a minute.
Well, what are you two bloodhounds trailing me around for?
We wasn't trailing you.
We was kind of moseying around sort of accidental like and here we are.
- I don't need you, get out of here.
- We thought it would...
- Sure. You know, just in case...
- Oh.
All right, wait here.
I'll be back in 15 minutes.
Here it is, sir.
The door's unlocked, he's in there waiting for you.
Oh, thanks.
Irby?
- You alone, Bradford?
- Yes.
I got your message.
What is it you want?
There isn't much I can expect, is there?
Not much more than you gave me in Libby Prison.
So now you're gonna collect for that tunnel?
I'm gonna have to collect much more than that, Irby.
There can be no deal before you, your friends and their gold...
...have been put safely away until this war's over.
Even then I can't guarantee that they won't hang you as a spy.
You Yanks always did drive a hard bargain.
But this time I have an idea we're going to trade on my terms.
Really? What might they be?
I prefer your company to your life, captain.
I had quite an argument about that with my friends, but I finally won out.
Don't move your hands and turn slowly.
I hated to do it this way, but you had to know sometime...
...and tonight you moved a little too fast for us.
You're going back home with us, an escaped prisoner of the Confederacy...
...back to Libby to lower-west and the sentence you ran away from.
I see.
Well, this was a very clever little trap.
Some consolation to think
I'm not the first man...
...who was ever fooled by a woman.
But you haven't got a chance of getting out of this town, Irby.
There's a squad of cavalry on every corner and they'd shoot you down on sight.
I only came here to give you a chance.
[HORN BLOWS FANFARE]
I took my chance and we won't have to wait much longer.
Fall in. Column of twos.
Back to the garrison.
Tie him up, we gotta move fast.
Bring him along.
Where do you suppose they're off to?
Hey, ain't them 15 minutes about up?
- They sure are.
- Well...
- Kerry!
- Hey, Kerry!
- Kerry!
- Hey!
[DOORKNOB RATTLES]
It's locked.
Kerry.
- Kerry. Hey, Kerry.
- Kerry.
- Kerr...
- Well, he ain't here.
You don't reckon that sawbones operated on Kerry, do you?
What are you talking about?
MAN 1:
Boys, we're ready.
MAN 2:
Wagons, forward!
Watch your wheels, boys, sandy territory ahead.
Bradford, I'll make a bargain with you.
From now on, it's gonna be a rough trail and hard riding.
If you give me your word you won't escape, I'll untie you.
Well, thanks, Irby.
I think we'd better leave things the way they are.
I don't wanna make a promise that I might not be able to keep.
Suit yourself.
Kerry.
I'm sorry this had to happen.
Sorry? What for?
Everything turned out the way you planned it, didn't it?
It was the last thing in the world
I wanted to do.
Well, you're the only one in the world who could have done it.
Boy, if your smeller can pick out a wagon track on them rocks...
...you ought to have been born a bloodhound.
Shucks, I can trace a fly across that dirty neck of yours.
Look.
Come here.
Well, them sure ain't rabbit tracks.
Be dadgummed if them ain't wheel tracks.
Yes, sir, and that's the way we're heading.
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, I do know.
This way of passing, they must be ahead of us.
What makes you so confounded certain he's with that outfit?
If he ain't with them, he's after them.
Did you know Kerry to turn aside from something he started after?
No, but you...
Marblehead,
I only made one mistake in my life...
...and that was when I started letting you follow after me.
- Come on.
- Well, let's get to riding.
Wagons, ho.
Nice work, Murrell.
- Did you lose any men?
- Oh, maybe five or six.
Big party you got here.
Yeah.
Here it is, Murrell. All ready for you.
Pretty big price you pay to get this wagon train out of Virginia City.
Not when you're anxious to get home.
MURRELL: Which way you heading?
IRBY: Due south.
MURRELL: Yeah, that's the best way.
Better you cut west this side of Las Vegas.
Then you miss the Union outpost at Mormon Station.
You cross the Colorado River at...
Yeah.
Just like I said...
...you cross the river at Sloan's Ferry.
The water, she's low this time of year.
Maybe you like
I ride a little ways with you, huh?
- No, thanks.
- Well, good luck.
Maybe I see you sometime.
That was a good tip about circling Mormon Station.
A little too good.
But we're taking no chances with Mr. Murrell.
Wagons, forward.
Sergeant, wagon train coming.
If only our luck holds out.
Marshall, you and Armistead ride back...
...and tell the boys to act natural and keep Bradford out of sight.
SERGEANT:
Pull up.
Pull up, everybody.
Hello, sergeant.
- Hi.
MAN 1: Pull up, everybody.
MAN 2:
Hold back, boys. Hold back.
Where'd you folks come from?
All the way from Kansas, heading for California.
Is this the right road?
It might be.
What do you got in that wagon?
Oh, some grub, a few pieces of furniture and a lot of tired people.
SERGEANT: Well, you got a long pull ahead of you.
You'll find some mighty dry country.
Excuse me, folks.
- And that one?
- Same as the rest, we're settlers.
You're welcome to look, but I assure you there's nothing there to interest the Army.
All right, go ahead.
Thanks, sergeant.
Wagons, forward!
Hold on a minute.
- Pull up, you men.
- Hold those wagons.
IRBY:
Any trouble, sergeant?
What makes these wagons sink so deep?
You ain't declared that hefty a load.
Why, it's the wagon itself.
Besides, your country's pretty sandy.
Maybe, but I'm gonna have a look just the same.
All right, everybody, get out of those wagons.
Come on, you too.
We're unloading everything.
MAN: Come on, get moving.
Get those wagons out.
He can't get far. Come on.
Cobby.
That's the last of him.
Go back to the wagons and keep rolling.
[TELEGRAPH TAPPING]
[TELEGRAPH TAPPING]
- Mormon Station, sir.
- Yeah?
"Gold train...
...passed through here...
...after killing guard.
Send force immediately...
...equipped for long..."
Well?
Something's happened, sir.
Push them hands up and reach for the roof.
Doggone it.
Say, you're sure getting so you play rough.
You knowed that was me.
- What do you mean trying to scare us?
- Well, I'm sorry, fellas.
I had no idea it was you until you fell on your faces.
Well, that's a fine welcome.
It would have served you right if I'd plugged you.
Where have you been?
- What took you so long?
- We been following...
What do you mean wandering around like a couple of strays?
Do I have to put bells on you to find out where you are?
- Well, l...
- Be quiet.
I can't depend on you any longer,
I can see that.
Serve you right if I knocked your bone-heads together.
- Oh, Kerry, it sure is good to see you.
- You bet.
My, how you two have grown.
- How'd you find me?
- We got a couple of good smellers.
- I'll say you have.
- We followed your trail. What's this?
MARBLEHEAD:
Somebody's been cutting up around here.
BRADFORD:
That's the gold train.
- Boy, I'm sure glad you're all together.
- I'm only just.
[TELEGRAPH TAPPING]
It's coming through now, sir.
"Will wait...
...here for you.
Captain Bradford."
- Order the assembly.
- Yes, sir.
Intelligence Department. Bradford.
- You drivers all set?
- We're all ready.
After you cross the river, turn toward Mojave City.
Should make fast time with these wagons, but be sure and leave a clear trail.
Good luck, boys. Now, get going.
Hurry, we gotta catch those wagons before they leave the river.
Right, Vance.
All right, folks, we're moving.
If we move the boy another mile, it might kill him.
If we don't move on, it may be all of us.
Won't you let us rest here today, Vance, for a few hours?
We can't chance it, Julia.
Sorry, Cobby, we can't stand by and let you rest.
I'll be all right.
Just keep on moving, Vance.
All right, we'll put him in the wagon.
Murrell said there was nothing to worry about after Sloan's Crossing.
I said I don't trust Murrell.
I'm dividing the train.
We don't know who's behind us or how close, so let's hurry.
All right, Vance.
All right, keep your wagons close together till we get to the middle of the river.
Whoa.
- This is evidently where they camped.
- Dad-burned if it ain't.
There are the tracks where they crossed the river.
We'll pick them up on the other side.
There's where they went out.
And they headed due south.
It couldn't be plainer if they'd left a map.
That's just it, sir.
How far can you trust that map?
They knew they were being followed.
Be the easiest thing in the world to cover those tracks up.
- Lf you want my opinion...
- I'd ask for it.
You saw the trail where they went in.
And this is where they went out.
I should think even an Intelligence officer would see that.
MAN:
Forward, ho.
COBBY: Julia, how much farther do we have to go?
Not far, Cobby.
We're almost there.
Shh. Don't try to talk.
You go back to sleep.
My stomach.
Wagons ahead, sir.
Whoa.
There are only four wagons, you told me there were 10.
There are still 10.
[MARBLEHEAD CLEARS THRO AT]
Ho!
There ain't nothing in this one.
It's emptier than his head.
Doggone, thunderation.
Major, the confounding stuff sure ain't in there.
Bradford, if this idea of yours turns out to be a wild-goose chase...
These wagons are just decoys, sir.
They purposely led us off the trail.
Loaded the gold into the other six...
...they must be ahead of us, either south or southeast.
Well, how about the north and the west?
We haven't tried them yet.
Since we don't seem to agree...
...I wonder if you'd mind if I took men and followed my hunch?
You could divide the rest up into patrols and spread out.
- We could rendezvous at Sloan's Crossing.
- Well, all right.
But I hope your hunch turns out to be a good one, for your sake.
Thank you, sir. I do too.
Walton and five men, join Captain Bradford.
Lieutenant, call the troops.
Circle in.
We're camping here.
Circle in.
His pulse is very weak.
Let me.
He needs fresh water, Vance.
So do the rest of us.
We'll make the water hole tomorrow if we're lucky.
There's the river. Water.
MAN:
This is the river we hoped for.
Mud.
How far to the next stream, Vance?
If this one's dry, they all are.
We mustn't let the others know.
Means too much to them.
We'll tell them it's a mistake, that this isn't the place.
We haven't reached it yet.
You go back to the wagons, John, and tell them.
Come on.
Go back to your wagons, men.
There's been a mistake.
I'm afraid we'll have to go further on.
I want to talk.
I know what you've been going through.
It's worse for you than the rest. You've got the responsibility of all these people.
I've got a job to do.
I know.
They've been through so much already, all of them.
Julia, you don't regret anything, do you?
Regret?
- What do you mean?
- You've changed.
You've been different ever since...
Tell me, what's on your mind?
Oh, it's just these people, they can't go on.
- We can't make them, Vance, it's inhuman.
- War is inhuman, Julia.
We're going on, just as long as we have the strength to go on.
How many days will that be without food and water? Two, maybe three?
There's nothing but desert between here and Texas.
That doesn't matter.
We're just a few. Thousands will suffer if we fail. We gotta get through.
Come on, Julia, we're moving. Come on.
MOOSE:
"Cobby Gill, age 11."
It must have been pretty tough for him.
For one of them, especially.
You sure was right about that gold train, Kerry.
That's the way they're headed, all right.
Walton, Brown.
- Yes, sir.
- Ride back to Major Drewery's camp.
- Tell him to follow us as quickly as he can.
- Yes, sir.
They started out with 10 wagons, now they only have four.
Whatever money they got is in those four, that's a cinch.
I figured we'd run onto them about here.
You figured? Didn't I tell you?
Yes, I've often wondered what I'd do without you two.
You see?
Who's that?
Dismount.
MARBLEHEAD:
I'll be doggoned.
Take these horses and keep them out of sight.
Tarnation.
That bunch is all tired. Wore out.
Maybe we give them little surprise, huh?
The rest of you stay here and keep them covered.
MAN: Bed down your horses and start your fires.
WOMAN:
Watch the children.
Hold on, Murrell.
- Hello.
- What do you want here?
I have some business to talk with Irby.
He's finished his business with you.
Maybe he thinks so, but not me.
For the fine service I have given him, two little bags of gold is not enough.
You named your price and we paid it.
Now, get out of here.
I think maybe you tell Irby
I want to talk with him, huh?
It's Murrell.
[GUNFIRE]
Doggone, tarnation.
It's the Yank, Bradford.
Hold your fire, men. Let them come in.
Don't shoot at them. Hold your fire.
- Thanks, Irby.
- Forget it.
This turned into a pretty good fracas.
Yeah.
How'd you learn to wing-shoot?
In Afghanistan, the kids do it.
- How much ammunition have you got?
- Plenty.
Vance!
- Oh, Vance.
- Let's get his shirt open.
Yes.
That's a bad one. Dr. Cameron?
IRBY: Bradford?
- Yes.
You take command, will you?
- Right. Don't worry.
- Yes.
Get him comfortable, doctor.
CAMERON: We'll get him on a cot.
- Vance.
- That's right.
- Julia.
Come over here. Follow me, quick.
Come on.
Now, line up shoulder to shoulder.
Now, hold your fire.
And when they get close, let them have a little volley.
All right.
If I ever get my hands on that cow-hided Murrell again...
...l'll make him squall like a mashed cat.
BRADFORD:
Once more.
Now, we hold off until daylight.
And when the sun comes up, we finish off this wagon train pretty quick.
Better build that barricade higher.
Get a little sleep if you can, Vance.
Thanks, doc.
Too bad, Irby.
I'm sorry.
I was hoping you'd come.
What's our chance of holding out?
Not much, frankly.
As soon as daylight comes they'll be down on us again.
Our only hope's Drewery.
When?
Tomorrow, maybe. Maybe not for days.
About the gold...
It's cost us so much.
If any of us gets through...
...l'd like it to do some good.
So would l, but that's not up to me.
What happens to the gold, that's out of my hands.
No, it isn't.
It was your job to get us and you did it.
Anyway, the South can't win now, but the gold still belongs to our people.
After the war, they'll need it to help thousands like them throughout the South.
I thought because of Julia, you might...
I told you, whatever happens to the gold is not up to me.
I promise you one thing, though.
Murrell won't get it.
But if Drewery...
That's all I can promise.
Where is it?
Under the floorboards of the wagons.
Right.
Too bad you and I had to be on opposite sides of the fence in this.
I think we might have been friends.
Thanks.
Marble.
Moose.
How is he?
How's Irby?
Oh, he's pretty bad, poor fella.
I don't think he'll make it.
- He told me where the gold is.
- Where?
- Under the floorboards of the wagons.
- Well, I'll be.
Look, get every able-bodied men in camp.
Get all of that gold into the first wagon there.
And speed it up, we've only got two hours till dawn.
Boys, come on.
You two men go with them.
- Dr. Cameron?
- Yes, what is it?
- How much gunpowder have we got?
- Kegs of it.
Get out two kegs and a length of fuse.
- What are you trying to do?
- We're moving the gold.
What for? What are you gonna do with it?
I haven't time for explanations now.
CAMERON: So you're taking the gold and running out on us?
- I'm afraid I misjudged you, Bradford.
- Did you?
Well, look, doctor, you take care of the wounded...
...and I'll worry about the rest, huh?
Come on. Here, hitch this horse up.
- Who told you where the gold was?
- Irby.
- You'd better go to him, Julia.
- Vance wouldn't trust you.
You've tricked him and now you plan to use us to take what's still ours.
Oh, I'd rather Murrell got it than the North.
I don't use those people who trust me.
In any case, this time tomorrow none of us will care who has the gold or where it is...
...because we probably won't be alive.
There'll be a certain rough justice about that.
What do you know about justice?
What do you know...?
I'm sorry we don't understand each other,
Julia.
- Come on.
MOOSE: We're all loaded, Kerry.
BRADFORD:
All right, Marble, you take the lines.
Now, the rest of you men, get on those wheels and start the load rolling.
Don't let her sink in the sand. Come on.
Bring the wagon nearer, close under that ledge as possible.
Now, unhitch the horses and get them out of there.
Right, one more keg.
Now, the fuse.
There it is. Come on.
Doggone scissor-bills, here they come again.
Thicker than hair on a dog's back.
I got him for you, Yank.
Father.
Father.
Why, you...
You dirty rat.
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
They killed him. They killed him.
Think it's gonna rain?
It always does.
Here. Hold this.
Follow me...
They ain't shooting. Watch them fall.
Vance.
[MUMBLING]
DREWERY:
How many men did you lose?
What you see here is all that's left, sir.
DREWERY:
Is the gold safe?
Well, where is it? Let's have a look at it.
There isn't any gold.
DREWERY: Is this your idea of a joke,
Bradford? Answer my question.
Have you searched the wagons?
I told you, sir, there isn't any gold.
Why, that's absurd.
Do you think I followed you hundreds of miles to believe this lie?
What have you done with it?
Who are you holding it for?
Just a minute, Bradford.
Yes, sir.
You're under arrest.
Get your belongings together, we're taking you back to Virginia City.
It is the verdict of this court martial...
...that you seized and withheld contraband of war for private reasons...
...and are therefore guilty of high treason.
Before final sentence is passed...
...is there anything else you wish to say in your defense?
Yes, sir, there is something I'd like to add.
It's true I took the gold...
...and I'm the only one responsible for taking it...
...but not for the reasons the court infers.
The court is willing to consider any reason...
...consistent with your obligations as a soldier.
There are some things that aren't covered by the military code, sir.
This was one of them.
You came here, not as a private citizen...
...but as an officer with an official duty to perform.
And I performed it, to the best of my ability.
My job was to see that the gold didn't reach the South.
I knew that if it did, it'd prolong the war.
The gold did not reach the South.
That was not enough.
It was also your duty to hand it over as contraband to your government.
That's true, sir.
I had a choice to make...
...a choice between doing my duty as a soldier or as a man.
Well, I made that choice. I couldn't very well have done anything else...
...after I saw what those people went through...
...for a cause they believed to be right.
And what has this to do with you?
Their leader hoped that someday that gold would still return to the South...
...where it belonged, to help them rebuild their homes and restore some of their pride.
Continue.
I don't think I can explain it any better than that, sir.
Except that I believe
I'm doing the right thing.
That's why I refused to deliver the gold.
That's why I still refuse.
Captain Bradford, that's your final decision?
Yes, it is, sir.
It is the sentence of this court martial...
...that you shall be executed on the morning of April the 9th, 1865...
...in the usual manner at the usual time prescribed by regulations.
JULIA: l... I can't tell you...
I've no words to...
Oh, I'm so deeply grateful for this audience.
I know how busy you are, Mr. President.
I was afraid you wouldn't see me, because I'm a Virginian.
Why, I've got a lot of friends down south,
Miss Hayne...
...and more relatives in Virginia than a Blue Ridge rabbit.
I've sort of missed them these last four years.
Mr. President, the execution is set for tomorrow.
That's less than six hours in Nevada.
I've been studying the minutes of the court martial, Miss Hayne.
According to military code, there's no question of Bradford's guilt.
I know that, I heard them say so.
I was there.
Oh, but I beg you, Mr. President...
...judge him as a man and not by military code.
He mustn't... He can't be killed.
I'm not a military man, my child.
He won't be killed.
Thank God that the killing is over.
Your General Lee is meeting our General Grant tomorrow...
...at a place called Appomattox
Court House to discuss the terms of peace.
Then we've lost?
Not lost, found.
They're coming back, back in the Union.
Miss Hayne, you came over 2000 miles...
...to save the life of a man who was once your enemy.
I think, very likely, you're in love with him.
Well, to me, you two are symbols of what I hope we can do for our country.
Mr. Lincoln,
I didn't know you were like this.
I want to tell them in Virginia, everywhere.
Yes, tell them we're not enemies, but friends.
That in my heart and in thousands like mine throughout America...
...there is no spirit of revenge in our victory.
There must be no harbor of hatred in their defeat.
Tell them we are now one people, united by blood and fire.
And that from this day forward, 
our destiny is indivisible. 
With malice toward none, 
with charity for all. 
With firmness in the right
as God gives us to see the right. 
Let us now strive
to bind up the nation's wounds. 
To do all which may achieve
and cherish a just and lasting peace... 
... among ourselves and with all nations. 
[ENGLISH SDH]
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Capt. Morgan.
- What can I do for you today?
- Same thing as yesterday.
You and your client wish to make a temporary exit from the port?
That is right.
- Name?
- Harry Morgan.
- Nationality?
- Eskimo.
- What?
- American.
- Name of ship?
- Queen Conch, Key West, Florida.
We're going fishing, like we've done every day for over two weeks.
We'll be back tonight, and I don't think we'll go more than 30 miles offshore.
Five francs, please.
One more thing.
You will go nowhere near the vicinity of territorial waters...
Sainte-Lucie, or Dominique.
- Is that a new order?
- Yes.
The decree was issued last night by his Excellency, Admiral Robert...
Governor General of the French West Indies.
Good for him.
- Why, any complaints?
- No.
Hello, Harry. How's everything?
That feels good.
- Did you bring me a drink?
- Horatio's bringing it.
You're my pal, Harry.
We sure got them this morning.
- We got them every morning.
- Not last Thursday.
That's right, I forgot.
You're right, Eddie.
Here's Horatio. Give him a hand, will you?
- Good morning, mon Capitaine.
- Good morning.
- Did you get the bait?
- Yes, sir. Plenty of it.
- That guard took a bottle of our beer.
- Mr. Johnson can afford it.
- Harry, can I have....
- Just one.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
- Are we going out?
- That's up to you.
What sort of a day will it be?
I don't know.
Just about like yesterday. Only better.
- Let's go out, then.
- Okay. Hop aboard.
- Stand by to cast off.
- All right, mon Capitaine.
- Mr. Johnson.
- Yeah?
- I got to get some gas.
- All right.
I'll need money for that.
How much?
28 cents a gallon. 40 gallons.
That'll be $11 .20.
There's $15.
- I'll get you some change at the gas dock.
- Put it against what I owe you.
Let her go.
Watch it, Johnson.
There's your strike.
Put on a little more drag. Not too much.
You'll have to sock him.
He's gonna jump, anyway.
Hit him again. Hit him three or four times.
Stick it into him.
Better get the other teaser in.
I got him!
Ease up on that drag.
He's gone.
He's not. Ease up on that drag. Quick.
If he wants to go, let him go.
- He's gone.
- No, he's hooked good.
- He sure is.
- Reel him in.
No. I'm sure he's gone.
I'll tell you when he's gone.
Reel in fast.
- He's gone now.
- Yes, sir, he's gone now.
- He isn't. Turn around and chase him.
- Reel in that line.
- I can still feel him pull.
- That's the weight of the line.
- You're crazy. I can hardly reel it in.
- Maybe he's dead.
Maybe. But he's still jumping out there.
- Come on. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying, Mr. Johnson.
- Can't you put bait on like that, Captain?
- Sure I can.
- Why carry this fellow to do it?
- When the big fish run, you'll see.
What's the idea?
He can do it faster than I can.
A dollar a day seems like an unnecessary expense to me.
He's necessary. Aren't you, Horatio?
I hope so.
Can't Eddie do it?
No, he can't.
What's the matter?
He just lost a fish.
Mr. Johnson, you're unlucky.
Would it be all right if I...
- In the icebox. Just take one.
- Thanks.
I don't see why you want that rummy around.
Eddie was a good man on a boat before he got to be a rummy.
He's no good now.
Start her going ahead.
- Is he related to you or something?
- No.
- What do you look after him for?
- He thinks he's looking after me.
All right, let her run.
- Mr. Johnson.
- Yeah?
Do you mind if I ask you a question?
Look, it might interest you to know
I not only bought the beer...
- but I put a deposit on the bottles.
- Was you ever bit by a dead bee?
- A dead what?
- A dead honeybee.
I was never bit by any kind of a bee.
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.
In that case, I'll just finish my nap.
Thanks for the beer.
Watch that line.
That's enough for one day.
- What happened?
- Nothing. You just lost a rod and reel.
You had the drag screwed tight.
When the fish struck, you couldn't hold it.
If you had the harness buckled down to the reel... that fish would have taken you along with him.
You're just unlucky, Mr. Johnson.
Now, maybe you're lucky with women.
- What do you say if we go out tonight?
- I'll lucky you, you dirty rummy.
- Are you a good swimmer?
- I've taken all I'm gonna take.
Me, too. Be careful you don't slip out of my hands.
Take it easy.
This guy owes you for 16 days.
Fifteen.
You talk too much, Eddie.
I know it, Harry.
Okay, forget it.
What about tomorrow?
I don't think so.
I'm fed up with this kind of fishing.
I can see how you would be.
Slack that off a little.
You fish for 16 days, hook a couple of fish any good fisherman... would give his life to tie into, and lose both.
- You're just unlucky. I never seen no one...
- Shut up, Eddie.
You said 16 days. I only owe you for 15.
No. With today it's 16.
Then there's the rod and reel.
- The tackle's your risk.
- Not when you lose it like you did.
I paid to rent it every day.
It's your risk.
If you ran a hired car over a cliff, you'd have to pay for it.
- Not if he was in it. That's a good one.
- That's good, Eddie.
You lost the outfit through carelessness.
It cost me $275.
I won't charge you for the line, 'cause a fish so big could've taken it all anyway.
And there's 16 days at $35 a day, that's $560.
No, it's $560, Eddie.
You got a little credit, so that'll be $825 altogether.
That's what you owe me, and that's what I want.
I haven't got that much with me.
I'll go to the bank in the morning.
- That'll be all right?
- I guess it'll have to be.
- Let's go have a drink.
- Good idea...
- Stay here and lock up.
- Sure you don't...
No, Eddie.
Look there. I thought everybody took their flag in after 6:00.
- Most of them do.
- That's Vichy for you.
It's their flag.
See you later.
Gentlemen, may I have your names?
What for?
I heard this gentleman make a disparaging reference to Vichy.
I never said anything about Vichy, did I?
I don't know,
I wasn't paying much attention.
- Your names, please.
- Look, we're Americans....
His name's Johnson. My name's Morgan.
We're living at the Marquis Hotel.
That do you?
Yes, sir?
- What's yours?
- Bourbon.
Bourbon. And a rum for me.
- Gentlemen, what luck today?
- Not so good, Frenchy.
- We lost the biggest fish I ever saw.
- Maybe tomorrow you hook him again.
Not me. I'm through. This is my last day.
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.
Here's to you.
I'm gonna clean up.
- That was $800 and....
- Johnson.
- Yeah?
What time tomorrow morning?
After I get to the bank.
Say around 10:30 or 11:00?
I'll be waiting for you.
- Any trouble, Harry?
- No, Frenchy.
- Then you are free after today?
- Yeah. Why?
There were some people in here today.
They wanted to hire your boat.
- Fishermen?
- No. Some friends of friends of mine.
Not a chance.
- The key, monsieur.
- Thank you.
Please listen to me, Harry.
They only want to use your boat for one night.
- They'll pay you well.
- For what?
I'd like to oblige, but I can't afford to get mixed up in local politics.
I would not speak if it weren't important.
Please, can I go with you to your room?
Sure. Come ahead.
Anybody got a match?
Thanks.
Who's that?
She came in this afternoon.
The plane from the south.
Now look, Frenchy, about that other thing.
I know where you stand and what your sympathies are.
It's all right for you, but I don't want any part of it.
If I'm caught fooling with you fellas, my goose'll be cooked.
Probably lose my boat, too.
I ain't that interested.
But they are coming to see you tonight.
You better get word to them.
They'll just be wasting their time.
Sorry. I'll see you later.
Take over.
Bravo!
I tried to reach those fellows, but I can't get in contact with them.
Who? The ones who wanted to hire my boat?
It's dangerous enough for them to come at all, but to come for nothing...
I didn't ask to see them.
You better head them off.
- Hello.
- Let's have it.
- What do you want?
- Johnson's wallet.
- What?
- Come on.
What are you talking about?
Mister, what's got into you?
What do you think you're gonna do?
I'm gonna get that wallet, Slim.
I'd rather you wouldn't call me Slim.
I'm a little too skinny to take it kindly.
Quit the baby talk.
Which is it?
You know, Steve,
I wouldn't put it past you.
I didn't know you were a hotel detective.
Johnson's my client.
He doesn't speak so well of you.
He's still my client.
Pick on somebody to steal from that doesn't owe me money.
He dropped it and I picked it up.
You were gonna give it back to him, of course?
No, I wasn't.
- I don't like him.
- That's a pretty good reason.
Besides, I need boat fare to get out of Martinique.
Another good reason... but you'll have to get it from somebody else.
- How do you like that?
- Find anything?
About $60 in cash and about $1,400 in travelers checks.
Do you expect more?
That bird owed me $825.
"I haven't got that much on me," he says.
"I'll have to go to the bank and pay you off tomorrow," he says.
And all the time he's got a reservation on a plane leaving tomorrow at daylight.
So he was gonna skip out on you.
Your client.
- Good thing you didn't give it back to him.
- Then I did you a favor.
That's right.
But if I hadn't stopped you... you'd have gotten away with the whole works.
After all, I am entitled to something.
Don't you think so, Slim?
What do you think is fair?
I'll leave that to you.
What would you say to....
Please, Harry.
I told them, but they insisted...
It is not Gerard's fault, Mr. Morgan.
Come in and close the door.
You know,
I told Frenchy I wasn't interested.
I know. But close the door, please.
I'm very sorry to intrude this way...
- but this is of great importance and we...
- One moment.
I'd better go.
- See you later.
- Stick around. We're not through yet.
It's all right to talk in front of her, isn't it?
- Go ahead.
- But it's no good.
- If you'd listen...
- No use.
- You're taking a chance coming here.
- We're not afraid.
I am. I'm sorry, I can't and won't do it.
We'll give you 2,500 francs.
- That's only $50 in American money.
- It is more to us.
It is only a little voyage to a place about 40 kilometers from here.
- We'd give you more money, but we can't.
- It's all we have.
Don't make me feel bad.
I tell you true, I can't do it.
Afterwards, when things are changed, it would mean a good deal to you.
Yes, I know.
Mr. Morgan, I thought all Americans were friendly to our side.
They are. But there's a rumor that they put fellas on Devil's Island... for doing what you're doing.
I'm not that friendly to anybody.
But they wouldn't do that to an American.
Do you really think that?
- Who's that?
- It's me, Harry.
It's all right.
- Hi, Harry? How you been keeping?
- Hello, Eddie.
- I wanted to talk to you about...
- Could we continue...
Who are you? Who are these guys, Harry?
Eddie's a friend of mine.
He was hanging around the dock after you left.
You have a good memory for one who drinks.
Drinking don't bother my memory.
If it did I wouldn't drink.
I couldn't. You see...
I'd forget how good it was.
Then where would I be?
- I'd start drinking water again.
- Maybe you'd forget about water, too.
No, I wouldn't. I see too much of it.
Was you ever bit by a dead bee?
I've no memory of ever being bit by any kind of bee.
Were you?
You're all right.
You and Harry's the only ones that...
- Don't forget Frenchy.
- Right. You, Harry and Frenchy.
You got to be careful of dead bees if you go around barefooted.
If you step on them, they can sting just as bad as if they was alive.
Especially if they was kind of mad when they got killed.
- I bet I've been bit 100 times that way.
- You have? Why don't you bite them back?
That's what Harry always says.
But I ain't got no stinger.
- Does he always talk so much?
- Always.
- What do you want to see me about?
- Oh, yeah, Harry....
I guess I forgot.
That's all right. I'll see you down at the dock later tonight.
Say, Harry, could you....
Thanks. You're all right. So long.
Sorry. We could stay at this all night and the answer would still be the same.
I don't care who runs France or Martinique, or who wants to run it.
You'll have to get somebody else.
Come on, Slim.
We still got some unfinished business.
Good night.
Make yourselves at home, boys.
Cigarettes are on the table over there.
I want to see Johnson's face when you give it back to him.
All right.
Where've you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
You're a fine one, running off with my girl.
She's got something she wants to give you. Go ahead, Slim.
Here's your wallet.
- How did you get it?
- I stole it.
That's a fine thing.
What are you gonna do about it?
The question is, what are you going to do about it?
You'd better look it over and see if it's all there.
It's all right, I'm sure.
No, you check it over.
She might want a receipt for it.
- It's all right. There's nothing missing.
- You sure?
Yeah. Now, young lady, I...
You better count those travelers checks.
- I know. There's $1,400.
- But you had to go to the bank tomorrow.
What's the time on that plane ticket you got there?
In the morning.
And the bank opens at 10:00.
- I don't like him any better than you do.
- I was going to...
You were going to sign some of those traveler's checks, weren't you?
- Yeah. Sure.
- Emil, you got a pen handy?
- Yeah.
Stay where you are!
- Stay where you are.
- I think I'm sitting on someone's cigarette.
- This is awful.
- Did they get them all?
One got away, at least.
I think it was Beauclere.
Look, Harry, this is bad.
But no one but me knows that you two saw them.
And Eddie, but he won't remember.
When the police come, you know nothing.
Do you realize, mademoiselle?
Don't be a fool. Stay inside.
Monsieur Gerard!
Cut it out, Cricket.
He couldn't write any faster than he could duck.
Another minute and these checks would have been good.
Stay right where you are and keep quiet!
Stay right where you are.
- Who's that?
- Sûreté Nationale.
Gestapo?
Lot of them, isn't there?
- What happened to this man?
- A stray bullet.
His name is Johnson, an American.
- Unfortunate. Take him away.
- Yes, sir.
Call attention.
Your attention, everyone.
All this is regrettable, but there is no cause for alarm.
We are only interested in those persons... who have broken the rules laid down for their behavior.
We shall pick out certain individuals.
Those we do not designate will leave immediately.
This place will then remain closed for tonight.
This man.
You.
And mademoiselle.
Was you ever bit by a dead bee?
Come with me, please.
I tell you, I didn't know those men.
They came in for a drink. That's all I know.
- You say you never saw these men before?
- No.
What are your sympathies, Monsieur Gerard?
I am for France.
That is well. Try to remain so.
Let us suggest to Monsieur Gerard... that the next time suspicious characters enter his place... that he notify us.
In that way he may prevent bloodshed at his doorstep.
I run a public place.
How am I to know who is suspicious and who is not?
- I think you will know. Good night.
- That is all. You may go.
- Got all of them?
- Beauclere and Emil got away.
- How?
- Jumped off the wagon, ran up an alley.
- Search all the places on your list.
- Yes, sir.
- Continue.
- Did you know these men?
I didn't.
- You did not see them at all in the café?
- Right.
What was your connection with the dead man?
- He rented my boat to fish from.
- You mean he had rented it.
The tickets in his wallet show he was to leave Martinique at daylight.
There was no money on him or in his wallet.
Only some American travelers checks.
Was that customary with him?
There was $60 in it.
- What happened to it?
- I took it.
- Why?
- Because he owed me $825.
So at least you had no reason to kill him, did you?
- So it would seem.
- But unfortunately for you, someone did.
As a result of which, you took it on yourself... to collect a part of the debt.
- That's right.
- You have this money now?
If you please.
If you please, Capitaine.
This is mine.
How do we know that?
Thank you. Do not be concerned.
This money is impounded by a government which, like your own... is at peace with the world.
If your claim is just, it will be discharged.
Mademoiselle. That is all for you.
"Browning, Marie. American, age 22."
How long have you been in Fort de France?
I arrived by plane this afternoon.
- Residence?
- Hotel Marquis.
Where do you come from?
Trinidad. Port of Spain.
And before that, from where, mademoiselle?
- From home, perhaps?
- No. From Brazil, Rio.
- Alone?
- Yes.
- Why did you get off here?
- To buy a new hat.
Why?
To buy a new... hat.
Read the label.
Maybe you'll believe me then.
I never doubted you, mademoiselle.
It is only your tone that was objectionable.
I'll ask you again.
Why did you get off here?
I didn't have money enough to go any further.
That's better. Where were you when the shooting occurred?
- I was...
- You don't have to answer.
- Shut up, you.
- Don't answer it.
- I told you to shut up.
- Go ahead. Slap me.
Come, Capitaine. This is not a brawl.
We wish to get to the bottom of this affair.
You'll never do it by slapping people around.
That's bad luck.
We shall see.
If we need to question you further, you will be available at the hotel?
I don't know how I'm gonna go any place when you got my passport and money.
Your passport will be returned to you.
As for the money... if it is yours, that will arrange itself in good time.
Do you suggest I see the American Consul and have him help you arrange it?
That is your privilege.
By the way, what are your sympathies?
- Minding my own business.
- May I...
I don't need any advice about continuing to do it, either.
- Good night, Capitaine.
- Let's get out of this.
Say, I don't understand all this.
After all, I just got here.
You landed right in the middle of a small war.
What's it all about?
The boys we just left joined with Vichy.
You know what that is?
- Vaguely.
- They've got the Navy behind them.
- You saw that carrier in the harbor?
- Yeah.
The other fellas they were shooting at, they're the Free French.
- You know what they are?
- It's not getting any clearer.
Most of the people on the island, the natives, are patriots.
They're for de Gaulle, but so far they haven't been able to do much about it.
- Are we in trouble?
- No, Eddie.
- I seen them pick you up and was scared...
- Everything's okay.
Go back and get some sleep.
I'd have got you out. You know me.
I know you, Eddie.
You go on back to the boat.
- Harry, could you...
- No.
- But...
- No more tonight, Eddie. Beat it.
- I could use a drink myself.
- We can get one in here.
What do you wish to drink, sir?
What'll it....
We're just looking around.
Change your mind?
No money. Those guys cleaned me out.
I forgot, too.
Maybe I can do something.
This has been a long day, and I'm thirsty.
Picked him out yet?
You don't mind, do you?
If you're thirsty, go ahead.
If I get tired of waiting I'll be at the hotel.
All right.
May I?
Thanks.
Hello.
Come on in.
- You're sore, aren't you?
- Why should I be?
- I didn't behave very well, did I?
- You did all right.
You got the bottle, didn't you?
- You're sore, aren't you?
- Get this straight. I don't give...
I know. You don't give a whoop what I do.
But when I do it you get sore.
After all, you told me to, you know.
- I told you?
- You said go ahead, didn't you?
That's right. I guess I did.
You were pretty good at it, too.
Thanks.
- Would you rather I wouldn't?
- Wouldn't what?
Do things like that.
- Why ask me?
- I'd like to know.
- Of all the screwy...
- All right. I won't do it anymore.
- I didn't ask...
- I know you didn't.
Don't worry.
I'm not giving up anything I care about.
It's like shooting fish in a barrel, anyway.
Men like that. They're all a bunch of....
I'm a fine one to talk.
The pot calling the kettle.
How long have you been away from home?
- This is about the time for it, isn't it?
- Time for what?
The story of my life.
Where do you want me to begin?
I got a pretty fair idea already.
- Who told you?
- You did.
- That slap in the face you took.
- What about it?
You hardly blinked an eye.
It takes a lot of practice to do that.
Yeah, I know a lot about you, Slim.
The next time I get slapped
I better do something about it.
- You forgot your drink.
- I don't want it.
- Who's sore now?
- I am.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
The door's unlocked.
- You forgot your bottle.
- I said I didn't want it.
You are sore, aren't you?
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer me.
I said you're sore, aren't you?
Look, I'm tired and I want to get some sleep.
That's not a bad idea.
What made you so mad?
- I've been mad ever since I met you.
- Most people are.
One look and you decided just what you wanted to think about me.
You were.... What's the use?
Go ahead. Keep on going.
You don't know me, Steve.
It doesn't work.
I brought that bottle up here to make you feel cheap.
That didn't work either.
Instead, I'm the one who feels cheap.
I've never felt that way before.
I wanted....
I thought that maybe....
Go on. Get out of here before I make a complete fool of myself.
How long have you been away from home?
It's none of....
About six months.
Going back?
- How?
- What are you gonna do here?
I don't know. Get a job, maybe.
Jobs are hard to get.
I don't think you'd like it here anyway.
Remind you of somebody, Steve?
This is brand new to me. I like it.
Would you go back if you could?
I'd walk... if it wasn't for all that water.
Quit worrying, kid.
You'll get back all right.
- What the....
- Here's that bottle again.
It's getting to be quite a problem, isn't it?
- You want a drink?
- No.
I thought you were tired and going to bed.
I know. I thought so, too.
You gave me something to think about.
- You said you might be able to help me.
- That's right.
But how can you do that if....
Are you gonna take that job with those men that were up here with Frenchy?
Yeah, if I can find what's left of them.
I flew over Devil's Island.
It doesn't look like a high-class resort.
- That's what I heard.
- I don't want to be the cause...
Don't get the idea I'm doing this just to help you. I need money, too.
Won't Frenchy help you out without you having to do that?
I don't want his help.
Don't do it, will you, Steve?
- Look, didn't you ask me...
- Don't do it.
Why don't you take this bottle and go to bed?
Here. Can you can use this?
I thought you said you were broke.
You're good. You're awful good.
"I'd walk home if it wasn't for all that water."
- Who was the girl, Steve?
- Who was what girl?
The one who left you with such a high opinion of women.
She must have been quite a gal.
You think I lied to you about this, don't you?
It just happens there's about $30 here.
Not enough for boat fare or any other kind of fare.
Just enough to be able to say "no" if I feel like it.
And you can have it if you want it.
I'm sorry, Slim.
But I still say you're awful good and I wouldn't...
I forgot. You wouldn't take anything from anybody, would you?
That's right.
You know, Steve... you're not very hard to figure.
Only at times.
Sometimes I know exactly what you're going to say.
Most of the time. The other times....
The other times you're just a stinker.
- What did you do that for?
- I've been wondering whether I'd like it.
What's the decision?
I don't know yet.
It's even better when you help.
Sure you won't change your mind about this?
This belongs to me, and so do my lips.
I don't see any difference.
I do.
Okay.
You know you don't have to act with me.
You don't have to say anything and you don't have to do anything.
Not a thing.
Maybe just whistle.
You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve?
You just put your lips together and blow.
Here, chick.
You keep watching.
It's all right. They have gone.
Go on.
You come along the lee shore of Anguilla from the south.
About three kilometers from the point.
- There's a little cove and a jetty?
- You know it, then.
- The signal's been arranged?
- Emil can show you.
- Emil's not gonna be there.
- Why?
I'm doing this my way. I'm going alone.
What are the signals?
You flash a light to the shore.
They will answer it with two lights.
One held above the other.
There'll be two people to bring back.
- How'll I know them?
- We've never seen them.
We know the name of one only.
Paul de Bursac.
That's good enough.
How about landing them back here?
Do you know Cape Sainte-Pierre?
- A boat can meet you offshore there.
- You be on that boat, Frenchy.
I'll get out of here around noon.
Supposedly fishing.
With luck and no patrol boats,
I'll be back in Sainte-Pierre at midnight.
I won't be burning any lights, so keep a sharp lookout.
One thing, Mr. Morgan.
Last night you very definitely refused to have anything to do with us.
Why have you changed your mind?
I need the money now. Last night I didn't.
- If you knew what this means to us....
- I don't want to know.
I'm glad you're on our side.
I'm not. I'm getting paid.
And by the way, I'd like that money now.
If I were you, I do not think
I would trust Mr. Morgan.
Did a doctor look at his leg?
No. They are watching all doctors who are friendly to us.
- Miss the bone?
- As far as I can tell.
He's lucky.
Why did you put a pillow under it?
- Why not?
- It doesn't hurt so much that way.
It'll have to hurt, you'll have to take it... unless you want to take a chance of gangrene setting in.
All right, I'll take that.
Are you a doctor?
No. But I've handled quite a lot of gunshot wounds.
You can trust me now.
Good luck, Harry.
It's all right.
- More café, mademoiselle?
- Please.
- What is that you're playing?
- Did you say something?
What's the name of that tune?
It hasn't got any name yet.
I've just been fooling with the lyrics.
They're not so hot, either.
Would you like to hear them?
Sure.
So it goes.
- That's about as far as it goes.
- I like it.
Yes. If I could get the right lyrics.
- Good morning, Cricket.
- Morning, Harry.
- Good morning, Slim.
- Hello.
- How did you sleep?
- The best in a long time.
- Have some coffee?
- No, thanks. I've had mine.
You were up early. What were you doing?
I was getting you a ticket on the plane this afternoon. It leaves at 4:00.
- Can you make it?
- Sure.
You took that job, didn't you?
See, I figured this way you wouldn't get your feet wet.
Yeah. That's right.
- That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
- Sure.
I just....
- You want me to go, don't you?
- Yes, I want you to go.
Okay, Steve.
Help her get on that plane, will you, Cricket?
I sure will, Harry.
I'm gonna be pretty busy from now on, so I probably won't see you again.
- If I ever get up your way...
- Yeah. Do that.
I'll leave my address with Frenchy so you can find me.
Maybe I'll know how to whistle by then.
- So long, Slim.
- So long, Steve.
Well, it was nice while it lasted.
Maybe it's better this way, Slim.
I don't know.
You haven't known him very long.
He's a funny guy.
- How are you, Harry? How's everything?
- Fine. I told you to stay at the hotel.
- I knew you was going out.
- Who told you that?
You can't fool me, Harry.
I knew it just as plain.
- Say, could I have a little...
- You're not going.
Could I have a little one, just enough to fill a hen's ear?
- Come on, Eddie. Get off.
- What's the matter?
There's no sense in getting plugged at me.
Take it easy. You got...
I wouldn't do that to you.
You're right, you wouldn't.
I'm not gonna carry you, that's all.
- What did you have to hit me for?
- So you'd believe me.
- You ain't treating me square.
- Who do you treat square?
You'd double-cross your own mother.
You told me so yourself.
I was only kidding.
Thanks, Harry. I knew you was my pal.
- But why won't you carry me?
- Because I don't want you.
You know, you're just plugged.
Never mind, old pal, you'll be glad to see me yet.
All right. Come out of there.
It's only me, Harry.
How did you get back on board?
I went up the street for some bottles.
Then I sneaked in while you was working on the engine.
- I knew you'd carry me.
- Carry you, nothing.
If I thought you could swim back
I'd dump you overboard.
You're a joker. We've got to stick together when we're in trouble.
- How do you know I'm in trouble?
- You can't fool me. I always know.
Where we going, Harry?
What would you do if somebody shot at you?
Shot at me? With a gun?
- Who's gonna shoot at me?
- If you're lucky, nobody.
Where we going? What're we gonna do?
I'll tell you when the time comes.
Get out some tackle.
Aren't you glad you came?
No.
- Here. Put this on. It's getting cold.
- I'm all right, Harry.
Say, what's going on?
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Yes, there is, too.
What's all the darn guns for?
In case we run into a shark or something.
A shark? At night?
Or something?
What do you mean, "or something"?
- Watch your course.
- What's the matter?
We're going on a job.
I'll tell you what to do when it's time.
A job?
What kind of a job?
What do you expect me to do?
Do you know how to handle this?
Of course I know how.
Everybody knows how to handle a gun.
All you do is work the lever and pull the trigger. You know I know that.
Such foolish questions.
Do I know how to handle a gun.
- What do I got to work a gun for?
- I just wondered if you could.
You know I can.
Harry, sometimes you act stupid.
Just plain stupid.
Sometimes I think you don't pay no attention to nothing I say.
Is it gonna be that bad, Harry?
I don't know yet.
It all depends on how lucky we are.
That's why you didn't want to carry me.
I knew there was some other reason.
You wasn't mad at me at all.
You was afraid I'd get hurt.
You was thinking of me.
Watch your course, Eddie.
I feel better now, Harry.
I'll be all right. You'll see.
What's the matter?
What are you looking at me like that for?
What are you laughing at?
Just a joke that neither one of us knows the answer to.
What joke?
Whether you're gonna hold together or not.
Don't say that, Harry.
I'm a good man. You know I am.
You are, but you're going all over the ocean. Stay on your course.
Why do you always....
Could I have just one?
I don't want to get the shakes.
Make it a short one.
I want you rum-brave, not useless.
Thanks, Harry.
What's the matter, Harry?
- Who's that? What are we going to do?
- Pick up a couple of guys.
Here's what I want you to do.
Take this gun and get back in the stern.
If there's any trouble, start shooting.
But don't shoot me.
Supposing something happens to you?
What do I do then?
How do I know?
You invited yourself on this trip, not me.
All right, get back there.
My name's Harry Morgan. Beauclere sent me.
Get that light out of my face.
- What happened to Beauclere?
- He ran into a little trouble.
- What's your name?
- De Bursac.
That's the name. It's all right, Eddie.
Come on aboard.
Wait a minute.
He didn't say anything about a woman.
Permit me.
This is my wife, Madame de Bursac.
How do you do?
What do you want to bring a....
It's your funeral. Let's get out of here.
All right, Eddie. You can relax now.
Don't unload. We're not home yet.
If she gets cold, you can put her down in the cabin.
Mr. Morgan, just who are you?
I own this boat. Beauclere's paying me to get you people back to Martinique.
You're not one of us.
You're not on our side.
I don't understand.
I don't understand what kind of a war you're fighting... lugging your wives with you.
Don't you get enough of them at home?
- You say you're being paid for this.
- That's right.
Then I suggest you stop talking and take us to Martinique.
That's where we're heading right now.
- What's the matter, Harry?
- Keep quiet.
I thought I saw something out there.
Listen.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Shut up. You hear that?
Is it the patrol boat?
Don't you know those engines?
Sounds like she's off there.
Stand by that wheel.
Wait a minute. Give me that gun.
You can't fight them guys, Harry.
What's the matter with you?
You ought to be telling me how good you are.
I can do it. What do you want me to do?
If we're lucky, nothing. If we're not, hook her up and get away from here fast.
- What does this mean, Mr. Morgan?
- Trouble, if they see us.
- What can we do?
- You can't do anything.
Just get down on the deck, flat, and stay there.
But I don't know what good it'll do.
- If you try to resist, we will be killed.
- Shut up, both of you.
Get down on the deck, flat.
You save France. I want to save my boat.
Hook her up, Eddie. Let's go.
Don't shoot!
We got lucky again.
Ease her off and put her on 160 and then get that first-aid kit.
That's not so bad.
You wouldn't have that if you weren't so anxious to give up.
Please help me get him on the seat.
Leave him. I don't want him bleeding over my cushion.
- Here you are, Harry.
- You can have a drink now.
Thanks, Harry.
Help me off with his coat.
Easy now, boy.
All right. Get ready.
The man in that boat will take you on from here.
But I don't understand.
Some people spent a lot of time figuring this thing out.
They know more about it than we do.
This is de Bursac.
He's the other guy
I was supposed to pick up. His wife.
- My name is Gerard.
- How do you do?
- Easy with him. He's been shot up a little.
- What happened?
We ran into a patrol boat.
They'll tell you about it.
I'll cruise around and give you a chance to get ashore.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Good evening, Mama.
- I thought you said she pulled out.
- I thought she did.
Hello, Steve.
You were going to put her on a plane.
- What's the matter? Didn't it go?
- It went. But I decided not to.
You did? I went to a lot of trouble to get you out of here.
- That's why I didn't go.
- Yeah.
You dames.
A guy goes out and breaks his neck to....
I might have expected it.
You're not sore, are you?
- It'd be all right...
- I got a refund on that ticket. Here.
That's gonna help a lot.
You better hang onto it.
- We can use...
- She'll buy it for you.
- Nothing but beer for him.
- I'll remember.
We'll be all right. I've got a job.
- Doing what?
- Frenchy seems to think I can sing.
It's his place.
Sometimes you make me so mad I could...
You could do what?
Harry, I need your help.
What is it now?
That's all right. Go ahead.
That man is very badly wounded, Harry.
I looked at him. The bullet hit the gunnel, it was almost spent.
- All you got to do is take it out.
- Could you do it?
Me? I'm hotter than any doctor.
They would have recognized my boat.
They'll be on my tail soon.
- All I got to do is walk out of here.
- You don't have to go out.
- You didn't bring them here?
- In the cellar.
Why didn't you put them in a goldfish bowl and be done with it?
We had to do something.
They're watching every road out of town.
See what you got yourself into by sticking around?
I'm ready to go any time you are.
- Please, Harry, will you do it?
- Not a chance, Frenchy.
Your bill here at the hotel, being overdue... amounts to 6,356 francs.
She's right, Eddie.
You really keep the books, don't you?
We'll be glad to dismiss the whole matter if you will do this for us.
- Throw her bill in, too?
- Sure thing.
- All I got to do is take the bullet out...
- That's all.
You almost had me figured right, Mama, except for one thing.
I'll still owe you that bill.
Up in my room you'll find a medical kit.
It's gray, this big, has the boat's name on it.
- Bring it to the cellar.
- Sure.
Here's the key. Bring some hot water, too.
This way, Harry.
Can I help?
Just stay out of sight.
If you run across the police...
- don't forget what I told you to tell them.
- What was that, Harry?
Just stay out of sight, Eddie.
I remember.
What do you want here?
I'll tell you. I was sort of invited.
He asked me.
- You're not a doctor.
- No.
- Where's the doctor?
- Please, be patient.
I have been patient.
How do I know you know anything?
- You don't.
- Wait a minute.
How long has he been unconscious?
Just a few minutes.
He's got some fever and his pulse is a little low.
He'll be all right when we get the bullet out.
- Don't touch him. Do you hear?
- That's okay. I'm not getting paid.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
She's not herself.
- Who is she?
- Harry, you promised.
You want to help your husband, don't you?
Then use your head.
We can't get a doctor without giving the show away.
Besides, he's got as good a chance with me as anybody.
I'm not going to let you do it.
Why not?
He's no different from anybody else.
Just a little sicker, that's all.
It means he's not worth so much.
You can have another crack at me later on.
- Hello, Slim.
- Hello.
Miss Browning, Madame de Bursac.
Don't get tough with Slim.
She's apt to slap you back.
That's what you said you'd do, wasn't it?
Bring the water in here.
- Wait a minute....
- He's trying to help you.
- Who are you?
- Nobody. Just another volunteer.
- Where do you want this water?
- In that basin.
- Is it hot?
- Boiling.
All right, then. Pour some of this in it.
And drop these in.
- Get out of here. You may not like this.
- I'll be all right.
Then take this.
- What is it?
- Chloroform.
Get over by his head.
If he comes to while I'm probing... pour some of it on a hunk of cotton and give him a whiff of it.
Don't open it till I tell you to.
Take out about four of those.
George, bring that lamp a little closer so I can see what I'm doing.
That's good.
All right, Slim.
Hold that a minute.
Easy, boy.
All right, open that can and give him some.
George, see if you can hold his head down.
Come on, hurry up.
That's fine. Don't worry about her.
Pick up that can.
- Any of it left?
- I think there's enough.
Wait a minute, I don't think we'll need it.
He's out, too.
Bring that lamp down a little lower.
Frenchy, bring that basin over here.
And fan some of those fumes away, will you, or we'll all be out.
There you are, Frenchy, there's your bullet.
I told you it was spent.
It would have smashed the bone.
All right, I don't need that.
All right, you finish bandaging it up.
Adhesive tape in the box.
I got to get nursie out of here, or she never will come to.
What are you trying to do, guess her weight?
She's heftier than you think.
- You'd better loosen her clothes.
- You've been doing all right.
Maybe you'd better look after her husband.
- He's not gonna run out on me.
- Neither is she.
Is it all right if I give her a little whiff of this?
You're with us again.
You were lucky. You passed out.
What happened? We must....
We'll talk about that in the morning.
See if you can get some sleep.
Thanks.
Why did you ever come along with him on a trip like this?
I love him. I want to be with him.
- That's a reason.
- There's another reason.
They told me to come, our people did.
They said no man was much good if he left someone behind in France... for the Germans to find and hold.
- That makes sense.
- I told them I'd only be in the way... that I could do no good, that I was afraid.
But the worst of it is that it's been so hard for him to have me along... because I've made him that way, too.
Now he's afraid.
He didn't invent it.
- Invent what?
- Being afraid.
Thanks, Mr. Morgan.
The fever's gone.
Do you....
I'm no doctor, but he looks pretty good to me.
If he wakes up, give him another one of these pills.
- Mr. Morgan, I....
- You're not gonna faint again?
No, I'm just having a hard time trying to say something.
Go ahead, say it. I'm not gonna bite you.
If it hadn't been for you,
Paul might have....
I'm sorry for the way I've acted.
You're not sorry at all, you're just sorry you made a fool of yourself.
I have, haven't I?
You don't make me angry when you say that.
I don't think I'll ever be angry again with anything you say.
Another screwy dame. Now, how can you....
Good morning. I hate to break this up, but I've brought some breakfast.
- Good morning.
- How's your patient?
- He'll be all right...
- Or haven't you looked lately?
He'll be all right.
I'll be back this evening.
- If you need me before then, call me.
- I will.
Yes, and I hope you have everything you need here.
The eggs may be a little hardboiled...
- That's all right, I like them that way.
- You're lucky. Isn't she?
I'm gonna get some sleep,
I'll see you later.
Thanks.
- What do you want?
- I could use a match.
Thanks. Now I need a cigarette.
Here, I can do that. Come on, let me help.
When I get ready to take my shoes off,
I'll take them off myself.
All right.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
- Just a little breakfast?
- All I want to do is get some sleep.
It's a good idea. I can help you there.
- Now where are you going?
- I'm going to fix you a nice hot bath.
It'll make you sleep better.
I don't want you to take my shoes off,
I don't want you to get me breakfast...
I don't want you to draw me a hot bath...
- I don't want you to...
- Isn't there anything I can do, Steve?
- Yes, get the...
- You know, Mr. Morgan... you don't make me angry when you say that.
I don't think I'll ever be angry again at anything you say.
How am I doing, Steve, does it work the second time?
You've been wanting to do something for me, haven't you?
Walk around me.
Go ahead, walk around me, clear around.
- Did you find anything?
- No.
No, Steve. There are no strings tied to you, not yet.
I like that... except for the beard.
Why don't you shave... and we'll try it again.
- Later, Frenchy.
- Harry, wait.
Renard, the Inspector, is downstairs.
You better come down.
- I can't do that, I got to shave.
- He's got Eddie.
He's giving him drinks and asking him questions.
I was afraid of that.
Good thing you didn't get me in that tub.
Look out for those strings, Steve.
You're liable to trip and break your neck.
- Strings? I didn't see any strings.
- They just don't show, Frenchy.
You ought to have seen that fish.
It must have weighed 900 if it weighed a pound.
It was the biggest marlin you ever seen in all your born days.
You know, a marlin is a swordfish.
- Good morning, Capitaine.
- Hello, Harry. How's everything?
- Fine.
- Won't you join us?
It's a little early for this kind of a party.
Continue, Mr. Eddie.
Did you hear that? He called me mister.
Say, you're all right.
- Was you ever bit by a...
- No, he never was, Eddie.
Go on with what you were saying.
I was just telling him about the big one we hooked onto last night.
Sir, that fish was so big that me and Harry could hardly budge him.
We pumped on him until we was all wore out, didn't we?
That's right, Eddie.
It was after dark and we was still playing him.
He must have weighed at least 1,000 easy.
Every time Mr. Eddie takes a drink, this fabulous fish grows larger.
He must have started with a pretty small one.
How did you finally manage to land such a leviathan?
We didn't, didn't he tell you?
- We ran into a German submarine.
- A German submarine?
Whatever it was, it turned its light on and fired.
- I didn't wait to find out.
- I do not think...
You know, you can't be too careful these days.
I do not think anybody could give a more logical explanation... for refusing to obey the challenge of our patrol boat.
Not to speak of shooting out their searchlight.
- Patrol boat?
- Yes.
That's what it was. You were right, Eddie.
I'm a good man in the dark, always was.
Funny, he kept saying it was a patrol boat, but I wouldn't believe him.
There is one thing that is not clear to me, Capt. Morgan.
What's that?
Why does a professional fisherman go fishing for his own amusement?
Don't you ever ask any questions?
Don't you ever talk?
No, I guess you don't.
What were you saying?
Does a professional fisherman go fishing for his own amusement?
He does if he likes it, and we do, don't we?
Yeah, remember in Key West when we went...
- We don't seem to be getting anywhere.
- It was the Fourth of July...
I was just saying,
Key West, the Fourth of July... three years ago at 8:00. I got that in.
- What about your passengers?
- It was 7:00.
You oughtn't to burn up at him, you fed him the rum.
- What about your two passengers?
- What passengers?
The ones you brought from Anguilla.
He was waiting on the dock when we came in.
You think I got them ashore in my sleeve?
You could have landed them anywhere on our coastline.
Right, I could've at that.
- Would $500 refresh your memory?
- My memory's pretty good.
I remember that you're the guy who lifted my passport and my money.
Would your memory become any better if your passport and money were returned?
Does that include the $825
Johnson owed me?
- Why not?
- And the $500 you just mentioned?
You drive a hard bargain,
Capitaine Morgan.
That's no bargain.
If these people are so important...
- they're gonna be pretty hard to find.
- Not for a man of your resourcefulness.
Think it over and let me hear from you.
- Did you hear all of that?
- Most of it.
Bee lips went away pretty mad.
When he cools off, though, he's gonna start thinking.
He thinks now that you will turn them in.
- Isn't that what you want him to think?
- What will happen then?
- He hasn't searched this hotel yet, has he?
- Not yet.
There's your answer.
He doesn't want them, but the whole setup.
- What shall we do?
- It's not we, it's you.
You can't do anything until that fella gets strong enough to move.
Until then, you're probably safe.
Better get rid of this.
- Bring us some breakfast.
- Sure.
- I thought you didn't want any breakfast.
- I didn't then.
- What were you saying, Eddie?
- I've been figuring.
Them guys don't think that I'm wise, but they was trying to get me drunk.
They don't know me, do they, Harry?
I think they're trying to find out something.
What do you suppose it is?
- Don't you know?
- I ain't got no idea.
That's a good way to leave it.
You got the hiccups.
Have I, Harry? Yeah, I never noticed.
- You better take a drink of water.
- What, water?
- That's a good idea, Slim.
- No, not that.
- It'll do you good.
- I'll be all right.
- Eddie.
- Yeah, Harry?
Keep out of sight and stay away from the police.
They won't believe that story you told a second time.
What story was that, Harry?
Keep out of sight.
Seen Eddie around?
No, sir, Mr. Morgan,
I've not seen him all evening.
Where's Frenchy?
I'm going to work. Do you like it?
You won't have to sing much in that outfit.
- You know, sometimes you make me...
- That's why I do it.
- Haven't seen Eddie, have you?
- No, not since noon, why?
He left the boat and hasn't come back.
- Is there anything wrong?
- I don't know.
Don't look now, but over there at the second table... there's a guy with a mustache.
I think he's following me.
Keep an eye on him, will you?
I'm going downstairs.
Stick around awhile, she's going to sing.
- I'll be right back.
- Give her my love.
I'd give her my own if she had that on.
Here's the rest of the lyrics, Slim.
How do you feel?
- I could use a drink, Cricket.
- Sure, come on.
- What will you have, Slim?
- Scotch and soda.
Same.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Capt. Morgan.
- How are you feeling?
- Much better. I'm very grateful to you.
Forget it. Let me have a look at this.
- There's no bleeding.
- No.
- Does that hurt?
- Very little.
My only trouble is when I'm eating.
I'm awkward with my left hand.
We'll see if we can have you shot in the other arm next time.
You won't need me anymore.
Frenchy, I'm pulling out.
- When?
- Soon as I find Eddie.
- Is your friend missing?
- Yeah.
What happened?
I don't know, he left the dock and hasn't been back.
- Usually does what I tell him.
- I'm sorry if anything happened.
- I won't know until I find him.
- Couldn't you leave him here?
I don't think Eddie would like that.
Frenchy, as soon as I'm gone...
Renard will move in and turn this place upside down... so you better start figuring how and where you're gonna move him.
- Wouldn't it be best if we went with you?
- Why do you want to go?
I'm still trying to get out of the jam
I got into bringing you here.
Why'd you come here in the first place?
I know why she came, she told me, but why did you?
Have you heard of Pierre Villemars?
Pierre Villemars? Yeah, I read a headline.
He was quite a guy.
- Vichy got him. He's dead, isn't he?
- No.
He's on Devil's Island.
They sent me here to get him... to bring him back here to Martinique.
He's a man whom people who are persecuted and oppressed... will believe in and follow.
Just how are you gonna get him away?
You don't think much of me, Capt. Morgan.
You're wondering why they've chosen me for this mission.
I wonder, too.
As you know, I'm not a brave man.
On the contrary, I'm always frightened.
I wish I could borrow your nature for a while, Captain.
When you meet danger, you never think of anything... except how you will circumvent it.
The word failure does not even exist for you, while I....
I think always, "Suppose I fail"... and then I am frightened.
Yeah, I can easily see how it wouldn't take much courage... to get a notorious patriot off Devil's Island.
But just for professional reasons,
I'd like to know how you're gonna do it.
We will find a way.
It might fail, and if it does... and I am still alive...
I will try to pass on my information, my mission, to someone else.
Perhaps to a better man, who does not fail.
Because there is always someone else.
That is the mistake the Germans always make... with people they try to destroy.
There will be always someone else.
Originally, we planned to do everything from here.
But then, because of my own clumsiness, it was impossible.
And that's the reason we have to go with you.
I couldn't get you on the dock, there's a man there watching... there's one upstairs, they're everywhere.
- How would I get you through the streets?
- How will you go?
They're watching me to find you.
As long as I haven't got you along,
I can at least get on the boat.
There'll be a fog, and the tide will turn after midnight.
I can cut loose, drift out beyond the breakwater... before I start my engines.
I'll still have trouble enough, even without you.
- But, Harry...
- Capt. Morgan is right.
This is not his fight yet.
Some day I hope it may be, because we could use him.
You have done enough for us already.
Gerard told me of your refusing
Renard's offer to give us up.
How do you know I won't do it yet?
There are many things a man will do... but betrayal for a price is not one of yours.
Good luck.
- I hope you find your friend.
- Thanks.
Goodbye, and thanks.
Frenchy, I got a few things to talk to you about before I blow.
Then I'll be up in a little while, Harry.
Any sign of Eddie?
- Your friend's still sitting at his table.
- I know.
- What's the matter, Steve?
- I don't know.
I think the whole thing's gonna blow up, it's too quiet.
- What will you do?
- We'll leave tonight... as soon as I find Eddie.
We're leaving here for good, the three of us.
Wait, I want you to know what you're getting into.
It'll be rough, I'm broke.
If we get out... it'll be with a few hundred gallons of gas and a few francs.
Just enough to get us to Port-au-Prince maybe.
I've never been there.
I don't know when you'll get back home.
It could be a long time.
It could be forever, or are you afraid of that?
I'm hard to get, Steve.
All you have to do is ask me.
How long will it take you to pack?
There's a lot of people around here, save it.
We won't shove off till midnight.
Go ahead and go to work.
- All set, Slim?
- Sure, but don't make it sad, Cricket.
- I don't feel that way.
- You don't look that way, either. Let's go.
Top note, boys.
Madame de Bursac wants to see you.
- Look, Frenchy, that's all over.
- She's up in your room.
Why did you....
Please, Harry, that's all I will ask.
Thanks, Harry.
You shouldn't have come, it's too risky.
I told you I can't take you.
I didn't come up for that.
You've already done too much for us... but there's just one other favor
I'd like to ask.
I want you to take these.
They were my grandmother's, and her mother's before that.
She gave them to me when I got married.
They're all I've got left.
I want you to take them out of here and save them till we can...
Suppose they get me before I get out?
Then throw them overboard, at least they won't have them.
Suppose you never come for them?
Then let it be a part payment for all you've done for us.
Please, won't you?
Steve, Renard just came in, he's on his way up.
- Did he see you?
- I don't think so.
All right, you take these, both of you get in there and keep quiet.
As soon as I get rid of him, take her back to the cellar.
All right.
Good evening, may we come in?
Good evening.
No, I never carry them.
What's on your mind?
The whereabouts of the two people we are searching for.
- You haven't found them yet?
- No.
But since morning, through our sources, we've learned their names...
Monsieurand Madame de Bursac.
That is correct, is it not?
- How would I know that?
- I thought perhaps....
Very nice perfume.
- You like that?
- Yes.
So do I. All right, Slim, come out.
- You've met the boys.
- Good evening.
Mademoiselle. Now we are all here.
Except your friend, Mr. Eddie, as he likes to be called.
- So you got him.
- Yes.
Now we lack only the two missing persons.
What're you gonna do with him?
If you will not give us the information we want, perhaps he will.
Before we made the mistake of giving him liquor... this time we will withhold it.
- You know what that'll do to him?
- I think so.
- He couldn't stand it, he'd crack up.
- You could easily prevent that.
Yeah, I can.
You got a cigarette?
- Can't you make him talk?
- When necessary.
You'll find some in that drawer, Slim.
You could save Mr. Eddie a great deal of, shall we say, discomfort?
And me a lot of time, if you will tell us where these people are.
How much were you going to give me?
More than what's mine already?
I do not think now
I will have to pay anybody anything.
You're probably right.
- I haven't got a match.
- Don't go any....
All right, go on, get them up. Go on.
Pull your guns, go ahead.
Get them out. Go ahead and try it!
- You're gonna get it, anyway.
- Don't.
You've been pushing me around long enough.
You were gonna drive Eddie nuts.
Picking on a poor old rummy that never....
Slapping girls around.
That's right, go for it!
Your boy needs company.
Look at that, ain't that silly?
That's how close you came.
All right, Frenchy, get their guns.
Here you are.
Now get over on that couch.
Go ahead, step over him.
Sit down.
All right, come on out.
That's one of them, the other one's in the cellar.
Take her down, get some help.
Have them ready to leave on the boat, then come back here.
Slim, you pack.
We'll leave as soon as we get Eddie.
Okay, Steve.
- Just how do you think you...
- Shut up.
You want to know how I'm gonna get him out?
That broke as easy as you will.
There's a phone in the hall.
You're gonna tell someone to let him go, send him here.
Yes, you are, one of you.
I haven't forgotten you.
You'll both take a beating till someone uses that phone.
So one of you is gonna take a beating for nothing.
I don't care which one it is.
I'll start with you.
You will release him immediately.
- Tell him you'll explain later.
- I will explain it later.
Tell him to send him back to the hotel and do nothing else till you get there.
Send him back here to the hotel and do nothing until you hear from us.
All right, inside.
You've got some harbor passes to fill out.
And now Paul and Madame de Bursac.
I'll be right with you, Frenchy.
- They're all yours now.
- Thanks, Mr. Morgan.
They are all ready.
These will get them past the guard and on the boat.
Where will you take them?
- Maybe Devil's Island.
- What?
Might even get Villemars off, wasn't that what you wanted?
Very much. Why are you doing this, Harry?
I don't know.
Maybe because I like you, maybe because I don't like them.
I'm glad you are on our side, Harry.
No kissing, Frenchy.
- You'll have to take care of those guys.
- We will give you plenty of time.
If you let them go, they'll come back and burn this place.
Let them, it will be a very small fire.
When Villemars comes back, it'll be our turn. We'll start a bigger one.
Meet you on the boat.
One minute, please.
That's all right, let him through.
- How are you, Harry? How's everything?
- It's all right now.
You look glad to see me.
You know a funny thing...
Don't know what they wanted, but they wouldn't give me...
I'll get you one down on the boat.
We're leaving, Eddie.
- Ready, Slim?
- In a minute, Steve.
Close that, will you?
- Say, what is this, is she going with us?
- Yeah, it looks like it.
Harry, you mean.... What's she got....
- Who are you?
- Was you ever bit by a dead bee?
- Was you?
- Yeah.
You got to be careful of dead bees.
They can sting you just as bad as live ones.
Especially if they was kind of mad when they got killed.
I feel like I was talking to myself.
I bet I've been bit 100 times that way.
- Why don't you bite them back?
- I would. Only I haven't got a stinger.
I remember you. You're all right.
She can come, it's okay with me.
I'll have both of you to take care of.
That's right, Eddie.
You can begin by grabbing these bags.
Come on, Slim.
Do I have time to say goodbye to Cricket?
Sure, go ahead.
- I came to say goodbye.
- What?
We're leaving now. Thanks for everything.
- Hey, Slim. Are you still happy?
- What do you think?
ENGLISH - US
This is the story of a squad of marines, a rifle squad.
I'm Corporal Robert Dunne, a member of that squad.
We were at Guadalcanal, and when it was secure we were pulled out for rest, refitting, replacements and retraining.
The Marine Corps is long on training and retraining...
Let that go.
After the canal, we were sent to
Camp Paekakariki in New Zealand.
Here we received our replacements, marines from Stateside, a long way from Stateside, 8,000 miles.
I can see you're a man who knows how to live.
- Solid comfort.
- Solid malaria.
- Malaria, huh? Contagious?
- No, not this week. You can stay.
Nice place you got here.
Regazzi's my name, Benny Regazzi.
Bob Dunne. I'm duty NCO today.
Great. Meet my friends. This big guy is "Handsome" Dan Shipley.
- Hi.
- What a physique!
The girls see him and faint. He comes through this, I'll make him a movie star!
Those two guys, Flynns.
That's Eddie and that's Frank.
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hello, Bob.
They don't drink. I got their beer ration.
- And Georgie Hellenopolis, an Irishman.
- Hello, sport.
- Where did you get those cards?
- Off your sack on the ship. Why?
- They're mine, that's why.
- I've seen lots in those bags that aren't.
- Come on, give me.
- "Semper fi", Mac.
- Hey!
- Leave them. It happens 20 times a day.
You know where those guys come from?
Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.
- By the way, who's the squad leader?
- Sergeant Stryker.
- What's he like?
- You'll find out.
I've been in New Zealand two hours and already they're clamming up on me.
- I hope he knows his stuff.
- Maybe we'll get liberty.
- We ain't replacements any more.
- Where is he? Where's the sergeant?
He's here.
- Well, what do you know? Stryker.
- Hello, Thomas.
- Thought you were in the First.
- I was. Sit down.
Just sit down, Thomas, anywhere.
My name is Stryker,
Sergeant John M Stryker.
You're gonna be my squad, a rifle squad.
Three of us have seen action: Corporal
Dunne, Charlie Bass and myself.
You'll learn from us. In boot camp you learned out of a book.
Here you gotta remember the book and learn things that haven't been printed.
You gotta learn right and fast.
Any man that doesn't want to cooperate,
I'll make him wish he hadn't been born.
Before I'm through with you, you're gonna move and think like one man.
If you don't, you'll be dead.
You guys have had a nice easy day.
I hope you enjoyed it because it's the last one you'll get for a long time.
You joined the Marines to fight and you'll get your chance. I'll show you how.
If I can't teach you one way, I'll teach you another. But I'll get the job done.
The skipper of this outfit is Captain Joyce.
Platoon leader is Lieutenant Baker.
Platoon sergeant is Sergeant Wright.
Any questions?
That's all.
10,000 sergeants in this corps and I draw Stryker!
You knew this guy before?
Yeah. We were stationed together in China.
Twice he kept me from promotion.
Turned me in once.
30 days I got.
He was a sergeant major then.
Must have done something to get busted to three stripes.
What did he turn you in for?
For... That's not important!
What's important is that he turned me in!
Maybe he didn't write the manual, but you can bet he can recite it backwards!
- It's probably tattooed on his chest.
- Front and back, Mac.
- Say, isn't your name Al Thomas?
- Yeah.
- Weren't you a fighter?
- Just in the Marines.
- Runner-up in the heavyweight division.
- Tell him who you were runner-up to.
Stryker. Lucky punch.
Meet your new manager.
Tell him why you lost your stripes.
My natural dislike for you is gradually developing into a great hate.
Don't let this guy do your thinking.
You'll get a square deal from Stryker.
You bet. Square deal.
I'm looking forward to the first time he and I come head to head off duty.
Hey, take it easy with that hand, champ!
Saddle up!
- All right, take a break.
- Take a break.
- How does your squad look?
- See me in about six months. Conway!
I was checking the records.
Your father was Colonel Sam Conway.
- What if he was?
- I was with him ten months ago.
He was my CO before he got killed.
One of the best officers and finest men
I ever served under.
- I thought if you...
- Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.
- For that, you sleep with your rifle.
- It was an accident.
- Nobody in this outfit drops their rifle.
- Fall in!
All right, saddle up. Pick it up.
Sometimes I don't know which I hate worse, him or the Nips.
- Your father was a good marine.
- Until ten months ago.
- You shipped in when he was killed.
- I shipped in because I was expected to.
In war the men of my family join the Marines.
I'm the last Conway, so here I am.
He'd be proud that you're carrying on the tradition.
Not my father. He'd have expected me to find some soft duty somewhere.
- In fact, he told me so.
- I don't get it.
I embarrassed my father. I wasn't tough enough for him. Too soft.
"No guts" was the phrase he used.
He wanted me to be like Stryker.
"The finest man I ever served under."
I bet they got along just fine.
Both with ramrods strapped on their backs. I'm a civilian, not a marine.
They're not going to strap one on mine.
I'm in here strictly for tradition.
- That the only reason?
- Yeah. Why?
Nothing... Stryker knows his business.
So did Jack the Ripper.
Knock off the skylarking.
You're in the wrong column.
Left foot close in there.
Look alive!
Choynski, you're all left feet!
Choynski! What do you think you're doing?
- Running the bayonet course, sir.
- Not in this league.
Yes, sir.
Your men are pretty ragged, Stryker.
Yes, sir.
That ought to take some starch out of Stryker. His boys didn't do so well.
Hanging him up between those poles, we'd do a lot better.
Choynski!
OK, so I'm left-handed.
- On guard. Give me your rifle.
- What is this?
You can't learn the easy way, you'll learn the hard way. Make a thrust.
- Without a scabbard?
- You heard me.
- You mean this way?
- Yeah, like this!
You get the idea? Corpsman!
All right, saddle up.
We'll do it again. Pick it up.
You're the only unkissable guy in camp.
This thing hurts. It ain't funny. No dame's going to come near a mouth like this.
Don't worry, I got the scoop.
No liberty for three months. You got time.
- Three months? How did you get that?
- I got spies everywhere.
They ought to throw the book at Stryker for doing this.
They won't. They'll give him a citation for teaching us to be good marines.
Choynski!
They tell me you're going to live.
You were lucky today.
Someone had been instructing you that didn't like you, you might not have been.
You better put in a little homework on that bayonet course.
Somebody who didn't like me? I wonder what he does to the guys he hates.
365 days in a year and
I gotta pick this one to nick myself!
You need a blow torch on your stubble.
Look who's putting out the scuttlebutt.
No liberty, he says!
Somebody made a mistake.
You got no kick coming.
You have, so don't go turning your back.
Will we take Hollywood with them physiques!
- First Platoon!
- That's for me!
- Here, Wright, any mail for Stryker?
- No.
It's going to be rugged again tonight.
He won't solve his problems with whiskey.
What would you do if your wife left with your kid?
- After five years I'd forget it.
- Stryker's not much on forgetting.
- Sorry, no letter for you.
- I know it.
You know ten-year-olds. There could be a thousand reasons why he didn't write.
- A million.
- Cut it out.
- Cut what out?
- Brushing me. The kid's all right.
- Maybe Mary influenced him not to.
- That she wouldn't do.
Of course not.
Stryker, you're a very unusual character.
- Can this be love?
- You know what I mean.
A lot of guys wouldn't see that a woman needs a husband who's not always away.
A woman wants a home and a guy to come in and out on time every day.
- You can tell me to shut up.
- If you can't talk to me, who can?
- Don't do it, just for once, don't do it.
- Do what?
Don't start out to get blind, staggering, stinking, falling down drunk.
Nobody starts out to get blind, staggering, stinking, falling down drunk.
Some do. Why not leave half your dough with me?
You got an old maid's failings. You worry.
Don't try to follow me tonight or I'll put a dent in that ugly head of yours.
- Ready?
- Just a minute.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Benny didn't strip his M1 fast enough for Stryker, so he turned him in.
They cancelled his liberty.
Perhaps our sergeant hasn't got a heart of gold after all, but he certainly is...
You talk too much. You think I restricted
Flynn for my own amusement?
The punishment's unreasonable, to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake.
I'm gonna tell you something, Conway.
I'm gonna tell all of you.
I'm gonna make it simple so you'll all understand it.
They handed me you guys as a present, a regular Easter basket.
They told me to get you into shape so you can handle a piece of this war.
That's what I'm gonna do and that means
I'm gonna tell you what to do every day, how to button your buttons and when to blow your noses.
If you do something I don't like I'm gonna jump and when I land it'll hurt.
I'll ride you until you can't stand up.
When you do, you'll be marines.
Flynn stays here.
Extra-hard product of a hard school.
Tough luck, Flynn.
- If my brother doesn't go, I'm not going.
- Shut up!
- Who are you telling to shut up?
- You!
Let's go before we all lose our liberty.
I wanna see those Wellington babes.
- How do you feel, boy?
- Like a little bird with feathers on it.
- Don't fly away, little bird.
- I can't. I'm still in the egg.
Beautiful, beautiful! I wanna dance.
You're gonna sit down.
Yes, ma'am, Tennessee, that's where I come from.
The greatest state in the Union.
They call it the volunteer state.
Right there is where I'm from.
Smithville, Tennessee, what a town!
These are all my cousins on my mama's side and these are on my papa's side.
We got the best tobacco there is, too.
More fertiliser comes from Tennessee than any other place in the world.
Listen to that band! Zombies!
They're all dead.
- Maybe they like music that way here.
- Or don't know any other kind.
- I'm talking these boys into a session.
- Maybe they don't have it in them.
After I'm through, they will.
They're breaking my heart.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
- There is a happy man.
- Wait until tomorrow.
- Don't be a killjoy, dance. I'll watch him.
- I'm not much on dancing.
- You might try just this once.
- No, thanks.
- Pete's my name, Pete Conway.
- Allison.
- Hello, Allison.
- Hello, Pete.
- You're warm. Want to sit down?
- No. I don't want to lose you.
- Cutting in.
- Shove off, Mac.
What would you say if I suggested we get some air?
I'd say I'm not supposed to leave the club with servicemen, but to you I'd say yes.
Now what?
We know all about each other.
- You'll be missing your train.
- I'll float back on thin air.
Don't do that. You might catch cold.
Funny, I've just met you and I feel
I've known you all my life.
I feel that way, too.
- Ten thousand miles away.
- Not now.
I wanna see you again, every time I get liberty.
I'll be here.
- Allison...
- Yes?
...l'm glad I met you tonight.
- The train...
- I know.
I'll walk you to the station.
I can get a taxi from there.
- No, I'll walk you home.
- No.
You might miss your train.
I might not see you again for a long time.
Any time I get liberty, she says, just call her up. Man, what a barmaid!
- I'll finish the war right here.
- Drink any more and you probably will!
New Zealand ain't got rats because they killed them all with that whiskey!
We'll drink worse before we get through.
They may bury me at sea tomorrow, but tonight I got that nice, warm feeling.
I got a great future for the next two hours.
You're bleeding!
Lipstick!
- Hey, fellas, look what I found!
- Hey, sports...
...look.
- Boy, he's really carrying a load!
- Gyrene!
Hey, Mac, you're a little off your course.
- Well, what do you know! Stryker.
- He's sure a mess.
Now I know what happened to those stripes. Come on.
Shore Patrol.
- That's what it is. Give me a hand.
- You're going to help him?
If he cut my mother's throat five minutes ago, I wouldn't let them get him.
What a break! He's all set to drop two stripes and Shore Patrol shows up.
- But look what he done to me!
- Don't tell me he kissed you.
That's a great one!
Did I tell you about the guy on a train and the funniest thing happened...
- I don't know why you're helping him.
- I'll take care of it.
- Where did you come from?
- Never mind. He don't need you guys.
- How do you like that?
- He must follow Stryker like a little dog.
What do you care?
At least he took him off our hands.
A day after our leave, we drew a 22-mile hike over terrain carefully selected.
All uphill, and it was a weary bunch of marines who pitched tents that night and gratefully folded themselves inside.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
All kinds.
I never did before but I sure do now.
- Why do you have to tell me now?
- Because I'm thinking about it now.
- I'm gonna marry that girl.
- What girl?
- The girl I met last night.
- You'll feel better in the morning.
I couldn't feel any better than I do right now.
I've been thinking, why do men get married during a war?
- Don't know.
- It's the worst time.
I fooled around but I never thought about marriage.
I know a lot of girls back in the States but...
...I think it's because when you get out here you're close to things.
You realise way down inside, no matter how much you try not to think about it, that maybe something's got your number on...
...and you want to leave a bit of yourself behind.
Doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl, just so long as you won't be forgotten.
There'll be someone who'd never have lived if it hadn't been for you.
Am I right?
I think I'm right.
- Hey, Conway, got a pass?
- I have.
All right, hop in. I'll give you a lift.
- I hear you got a girl in town.
- What if I have?
- They say she's a very nice girl.
- They talk too much.
Are you serious about her?
With things the way they are, this is no time to start getting serious with a girl.
Don't know how long you're gonna be here or when you'll be back again.
Don't even know how long you'll live.
If it's in the line of duty, you can tell me to do something and I'll do it.
As for my personal life, keep your hands off.
- Your father would've said it.
- I wouldn't have listened.
- You never did.
- How do you know?
- He told me.
- What did he say?
I'll tell you. He said
I was a disappointment, right?
He said I wouldn't be able to stand up for myself, right?
- You're doing the talking.
- No, my father is.
Every time you open your mouth, he's talking. Every thought you think is his.
It's as though he's at my shoulder.
But he didn't always say or think the right thing.
You're gonna find that out when the time comes. Until then leave me alone.
- You want a lift or not?
- Yeah, sure.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Why?
- You've hardly said a word.
- You're right. I've been thinking.
- About us?
- Myself.
That's selfish.
Honey, do you think I'm a brave man?
- What a funny question to ask.
- Well, do you?
I don't know. Why?
- I've got to prove something to someone.
- Who?
You don't know him. He's dead now.
Yes, Pete, I think you're brave.
That helps. You don't know how much that helps.
Let's not talk about it any more.
We should have been talking about ourselves all this time, what's going to happen to us.
- What do you want to happen?
- I want to marry you.
I want that, too.
Funny, we barely know each other.
We see each other for what seems only moments. And yet...
I know what you mean.
- Choynski, not going to the wedding?
- No.
I'd better get a transfer. I can't learn this bayonet business. I'm all thumbs.
- On guard.
- No, Sarge, not again!
- I'm not well from the last time.
- On guard!
- Play that thing again. You lead.
- What?
You lead!
Shift your weight.
Left, left!
There. Keep it up.
You'll get the knack of it.
Practise that about a half an hour every day.
Hey, Sarge! I got it!
I haven't been in church since I was 14.
- Kissing the bride's a great invention.
- Sure makes me homesick.
- What's the matter?
- He looks the same.
- How do you expect him to look?
- Married, wrinkled, worried, like me.
- 44 hours and 34 minutes left. Go!
- Excuse me, sports.
Here's your wedding present from the gang.
You've all been wonderful.
- Are you sure you've got the right guy?
- I'm sure.
Come on, get going!
- "Sempre felice", Mac!
- Keep the situation well in hand, Pete!
We got 44 hours and 33 minutes.
What are we gonna do?
Al, if I was a girl, I'd marry you.
Knock it off! I've had a hard day.
What am I doing?
44 hours and 32 minutes.
That isn't very long, is it?
No, not long at all.
I wonder how many other people have had 44 hours and 32 minutes.
Lots I guess.
- We'll make it seem a long time.
- Years.
- Shall I open it?
- Sure, go ahead.
They're in a hurry!
Others were in a hurry.
The order said move out and the Marines moved out.
11 days at sea. Destination?
Only the top brass knew.
Though, of course, scuttlebutt knew the answer, a hundred answers, all wrong.
Boat Squad... halt, one, two!
Dismissed!
Too bad you couldn't see her again.
You didn't get long.
We knew it might happen.
I'll be back. I've got to believe that.
- Sure. We'll all be back.
- Gangway!
That's no way to carry a flag, Regazzi.
I've got to teach you everything.
Now watch this...
What are you gonna do with this, Benny?
I'm gonna put that up in Tokyo, right in the middle of Times Square.
- There isn't any Times Square in Tokyo.
- There will be when I get there.
Now that's the way to fold a flag, with the blue field showing.
What do you know!
- You got my shirt!
- It's my shirt!
- I'm telling you, it's my shirt!
- It's my shirt!
Here, fellas. You'd better quit fighting so much.
If you don't, one of you's apt to get hurt.
Corpsman! Corpsman!
- What's that?
- Relax. It's the Navy clearing its throat.
Sure don't sound like no squirrel gun.
I hope they practise real good. What island do you think we're aiming at?
We'll get word.
- Here it is.
- It looks like a pork chop.
- What's its name?
- Tarawa.
Never heard of it. It's the wrong place.
It's part of an atoll called Tarawa Atoll.
This particular island is called Betio.
Don't ask me how you spell it.
You'll have to stick your faces into it but you don't have to spell it.
- This is Red Beach Three. That's us.
- What have they got there?
Everything. This island's held by a special naval landing force.
That means Japanese marines.
They're dug in and they're mean.
They'd just as soon die as stick a nickel in a jukebox, but that's all right.
Let the other guy die for his country.
You'll live for yours.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- Get over there.
- I can hear him.
Get over there. I don't want anybody hurt because you didn't listen.
- Schoolteacher, do me some homework.
- What's your problem, son?
Put down 5,000. Scuttlebutt says that's how many Nips are on that rock.
- The Navy fired 1,000 tons of shells.
- Don't forget the fly-fly boys.
Those B-24s have really been working them over.
Now add the tons of explosives, divide it by the Nips and get the answer.
- Maybe we'll be back for noon chow.
- Don't figure that way.
The Navy and the fly-fly boys unloaded plenty on the canal before we went in.
When we got ashore there were still a lot of those lemon-coloured guys waiting.
Only way that island was taken was by putting marines on the beach.
You've heard the naval foray's a waste of time and metal. Stryker knows better.
- Who cut you in on this conversation?
- You say when I can and can't talk?
- Just when you can't talk to me.
- Knock it off, Conway.
I've had enough of your "hardbitten sergeant" attitude.
You're so big everybody's been afraid to take a punch at you. I'm not!
Cool off!
Forget that pencil and paper routine and worry about staying alive on that beach.
- Don't expect any soft touch!
- "Now hear this"!
All troops report to your debarking stations!
All right, men, sound off when your name's called.
Now hear this, there'll be no movies tonight!
The place is opened up for business.
- Missed!
- Maybe they're firing blanks.
- Maybe a two-headed kid's aiming.
- Maybe this is just manoeuvres.
Get out now. We're crossing the line of departure. Lock and load!
- Good luck, Sarge!
- Charlie, give me a hand here!
Lieutenant, hit the deck! How is it?
I got hit!
Corpsman! You'll be all right.
They got us pinned down!
We can't get over these logs!
- I'm going while I can!
- Stay here, kid!
We're gonna be killed here.
I'd like to get at them!
Why rush? This is a nice place.
- They got the lieutenant!
- They'll get all of us if we don't move.
We are like fish in a barrel lying here.
- Did we train to take it lying down?
- Sarge, do something about it!
Stay where you are until I tell you.
You gotta get us out of here!
If you're nervous count your toes.
I'll do the masterminding around here.
- Where's Lieutenant Baker?
- Machine-gunned.
- Is your squad all right?
- All but one. What's holding us down?
That bunker, an old power plant. All these bombs and they're still killing us.
- Smoke, sir?
- Thanks.
I've sent for flame-throwers to assist.
Your squad will support. Follow me!
You heard! Move out and stay down!
We've gotta silence that bunker!
Request naval gunfire be lifted on target areas, coordinates...
...two-four-six-zero-sugar-tare. Over.
Roger and out.
Flame-throwers out! Demolition in!
Demolition out!
Shipley!
Give me a hand with this pack.
Throw it!
Move out!
Get him out of there!
- There goes one of your nine.
- Now we got tanks.
Better late than never.
Come on!
Corpsman! Corpsman! This way!
Don't wait. They'll find me.
Keep going. Hit 'em for me.
Find Stryker. Stick with him.
He's good people.
Tell him I...
I'd like to know where the rest of the squad went.
- What's this place?
- Whatever it is it ain't healthy!
Let's go!
That was close.
Next time don't be in such a hurry.
- You're across, ain't you?
- Across what? To where?
- I'm running low on ammo.
- I am too.
Forgot about that.
We gotta get some more.
- I'll go.
- Wait! Pick a number from one to six.
- Two.
- Five.
You're both wrong.
That guy kills me.
Thomas better hurry!
- How about some bandoliers, Mac?
- Help yourself.
- How are things going up front?
- Pretty rough.
- Keep it coming.
- Good luck.
- Is that coffee?
- It sure is. Do you want some?
Do I want some, he says!
I haven't had any joe since we left the ship.
You mortarmen sure live the life of Riley here.
Here you are.
Beautiful!
- Where's Thomas?
- Probably dead.
No, not that guy. Let's get out of here!
- Can I have some for my buddies?
- Sure. Break out your canteen.
Tell me, how's everything been going?
Couldn't be better, Mac.
Oh, this is the life!
Come and get it, you guys!
Ammo and fresh hot joe!
Hellenopolis!
Bass!
Hey, Greek!
Hey, Greek!
- What kepts you, Thomas?
- Where's Bass?
Gutted.
No ammo.
What kept you, sports?
Major Crowe, sir.
- Jim? How you doing?
- "It's tough going, Dave".
I've committed every man.
We're dug in and staying.
Good. I've been getting reports all day that the Nips are slipping in to your front.
If it's "banzai" tonight, target area 2-41 is a hot spot.
What outfit have you got there?
Joyce and Stryker.
Pass the word they gotta dig in and stay put.
No noise or movement.
Don't risk anybody unless you have to.
Hold on until we get more men there.
Yes, sir.
Major Crowe says the Nips have been filtering into these tank traps.
Disperse your squad along this section.
Tell your men there's to be no smoking, no moving or unnecessary talking.
If they find out how thin we are, they can get to the beach.
That's a platoon area. All I got's a beat-up squad, short three men.
- Couldn't you...?
- Can I give you three men?
The battalion can't give the whole company three replacements.
Your squad is covering the hottest spot in the line.
If it's an attack tonight they'll strike you first. They want to know our disposition.
I repeat, your men are not to move.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Stryker, we're going to hold this line.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Good luck.
All right, saddle up. Follow me.
Everybody go!
Drop off at intervals, two-man foxholes.
We're gonna be spread out thin tonight.
Don't give away your position or strength.
You Flynns stay here, and no quarrels.
Dunne and Smith, drop out here.
No gab tonight!
You and Harris here! Come on, Conway.
Corpsman!
Listen.
- Corpsman!
- That's a marine.
Corpsman!
- Stryker!
- Get down and stay down!
- You had your orders!
- Somebody's wounded!
- Quiet.
- Let's get him!
Stay down! It may be an old Jap trick.
They pulled it on the canal.
- It doesn't sound like a Jap to me.
- I don't care. You'll tip our position.
Stryker!
It's Bass!
How many Japs know your name?
- You know his voice.
- Shut up.
Aren't you human at all?
A friend of yours may be dying!
Knock it off!
This is what my father taught you.
Be a great marine, be tough.
Sit here if you want. I'm getting him.
The only way you'll stop me is to kill me.
That's just what I'll do!
Stryker!
Stryker!
Sarge!
Stryker!
Please, Sarge!
Tarawa was officially declared secure at 13.30 on the fourth day of battle.
The replacements came ashore, our wounded were cared for and the assault troops were relieved.
- How am I doing, Chaplain?
- God has been good to you.
You're going home.
Per istam Sanctam Unctionem, et suam piisimam, indulgeat tibi Dominus
"quidquid deliquisti. Amen".
Somebody beat me to it.
Skipper gave out some news.
Part of it's good, part of it's bad.
- They found Hellenopolis. He's dead.
- He was a good Greek.
Choynski, Soames and Bass are on a hospital ship Stateside-bound.
- I wish I was with them.
- Let's get cleaned up.
Wash out those dungarees and let's look like marines.
You too, Thomas.
- Dunne.
- Yeah?
I got a couple of bottles of sake in my gear. Give it to the squad.
- Right.
- Tell them you got it off a dead Nip.
Why don't you break down a little?
You got it off a dead Nip.
Aye, aye.
- What's eating you?
- Know what Stryker plans tomorrow?
Another squad problem and I'm so tired of problems!
I'm tired of Stryker!
I'm also tired of beautiful Hawaii.
Me, too.
Hey, champ, what do you think of beautiful Hawaii?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Clamming up again, ever since Tarawa.
- Why the silence?
- Knock it off!
- Hi! You got room for me?
- What do you know!
- You got time off for good behaviour?
- Yeah.
- Where were you? Pearl Harbor?
- Yeah, nice place. Pretty nurses.
I'll give somebody $5 to shoot me in the foot.
- I'll do it for $2.50.
- You're too willing!
Some replacements out here assigned to our squad.
We build up the joint and they come and live in it.
This is Stein and Fowler and McHugh.
He's Fowler. Mike McHugh, from Cedar
Rapids to see this war's over in a hurry.
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.
- How old?
- Well, eighteen... going on eighteen.
We heard that the squad leader's tough.
- There are rumours to that effect.
- Tough sergeants roll off my knife!
You're gonna find your first few days with Sergeant Stryker very interesting.
You new men come with me.
- Attention!
- Charlie! How are you?
- Certified fit for duty, so the medics say.
- Good.
The replacements came up with me.
They get younger all the time.
- Or we're getting older.
- Or both.
- I can stand having you back.
- I can stand being back.
What happened to the squad, besides the Greek, Shipley and Thomas?
Choynski...
Thomas? He never got a scratch.
- I was sure he got it.
- Why?
When we got stuck in a trench he went back to get ammo. Never came back.
How long between the time he went back and you got overrun?
About 40 minutes.
40 minutes?
Stay here.
Thomas!
- Yeah?
- Outside.
- What's that about?
- Don't ask me. I haven't any spies.
- That's far enough.
- What's this about?
Just that I hate your guts!
Get up.
You doped off and got one of my men killed and one of them bayoneted!
- You haven't had enough. Get up!
- Stryker...
Attention! All right, break it up.
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Stryker. Able Company, sir.
And you?
Pfc Thomas. Able Company, sir.
This may take some explaining before a court martial. Help that man up.
- You'll need medical attention.
- I'll be OK, sir.
That's debatable. You know it's not permissible for an NCO to strike a man?
- Yes, sir.
- Who struck the first blow?
Colonel, there wasn't any first blow struck exactly.
A simultaneous explosion perhaps?
Judo, sir. The sergeant was showing me how to break a judo hold.
No more judo exhibitions.
Understand, Sergeant?
Aye, aye, sir.
At least you're no stool pigeon.
Wait a minute, Stryker.
I'm wrong, dead wrong. I know it.
I doped off for some coffee, but I didn't think a few minutes mattered.
- It did!
- I know that now, but I didn't then.
It's killing me. I can't sleep.
A hundred times I wanted to tell you, tell somebody. I...
I liked that Greek...
I'd do anything for him.
If I could I'd change him for me right now.
I think you would.
Guys make mistakes but every one we make, a stack of chips goes with it.
We make a mistake and some guy don't walk away!
For evermore he don't walk away.
I guess all we can do is just take it...
...and hope we don't make the same mistake again.
I won't.
Let's get back.
Mail call! First Platoon.
A letter from my wife after 18 months.
Know where she is?
In England, entertaining troops.
Entertaining troops? Why isn't she here entertaining me? I'm a troop.
"They're all such nice boys. There's a lieutenant here..." A lieutenant!
When I get back she'll need standing up for a month! I put on muscle lately!
Darling, this is a funny way for a man to find out he's a father, but you are.
It happened the day before yesterday, just in time for breakfast.
He's a boy and looks beautiful like me and intelligent like you.
I should have told you it was going to happen, but I didn't want to worry you.
I don't know what to call him.
We never discussed that.
- I'm a father! Hey, I'm a father!
- Let's see!
- I'm a father!
- All right, let's fall in!
Come on!
Finally we got our leave.
Ten days in Honolulu.
All of us were out on the town.
All except Stryker.
He was still the same.
- Lonesome?
- Drift.
- Whiskey.
- Two?
- Please.
- OK.
Thanks. A drink'll be good. I'm tired.
It's been a rough day...
Knock it off!
I'm sorry, Sergeant.
- Right.
- Thanks.
65 cents for a drink. It's too much.
They cheat servicemen.
We could drink cheaper at my house.
Don't throw your arm out of joint.
Thanks for the drink. I didn't mean to make too much buzzing in your ear.
It's all right, finish your drink.
- I didn't mean to sound so tough.
- I know. You're just unhappy.
Me, too.
My name's Mary.
The long arm of coincidence, or something.
Her name, too.
That invitation still hold?
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll fix us a drink.
Oh, dear!
Well, I can get us some more in a jiffy.
I see.
Will a sawbuck do it?
Go on, take it. It's only paper.
Well, I'll be right back.
- I hope this is your brand.
- Any brand is mine.
- She says she's hungry.
- He.
Advise him against joining the Marines.
Mummy's fixing you something. Her boy'll be quiet while she has company.
Knock it off...
Where's his father?
Gone.
Well, I guess into each life a little rain must fall.
There are a lot tougher ways of making a living than going to war.
You know about babies.
Yeah, I know about babies.
So long, Mac.
- Wait!
- I can't spend it on a coral reef.
- You're a very good man.
- You'll get odds on that in the Marines.
So long.
So long, Sergeant. I'll pray for you.
Let's not get religion.
- I'll pray for you, Sergeant!
- Good luck.
You got a lot of bloodhound in you,
Charlie, but you can call off the dogs.
I'm smarter than I was 30 minutes ago.
Catch me feeling sorry for myself again and you got my permission to belt me in the nose!
- Buy you a drink?
- Lock and load, boy!
- Thanks!
- Two bourbon and ice.
- A baby's a big event.
- Conway!
- Treating the boys?
- Crack open the hatch!
That's great. A fellow always gets more kick out of a boy, I guess.
I got a kid. Sam, I named him...
...after your old man.
Wait till he gets to be ten and doesn't write. You'll be mad enough to hit him.
No, I won't, Stryker, because he won't have to write. I'll be where he is.
And I won't insist that he be tough.
I'll try to make him intelligent.
And I won't insist that he read the Marine
Corps manual. I'll get him Shakespeare.
I don't want him to be a Colonel Conway or Sergeant Stryker.
I want him to be intelligent, considerate, cultured and a gentleman.
- You're out of line, kid.
- Let him be. He has a right to dislike me.
Thanks, and I intend to exercise that right.
- I don't like you, Stryker.
- Let's talk sense for a minute, Conway.
I can't have friction in the squad.
I've tried every approach to you that I know. Got nowhere. You're intelligent...
Don't patronise me. Your opinion of my IQ doesn't interest me in the least.
Let's get this straight.
On duty I jump when you holler.
Off duty I exercise my God-given rights under a democracy and dislike whom I please.
Do we understand each other?
- Beat it.
- Come on, you guys, let's go.
I don't understand why you don't belt him.
- Mellow in my old age, I guess.
- Too bad.
"Screaming Sam" couldn't be proud of him.
He could. There's something inside a guy, always proud of a kid.
- Two more?
- Not for me.
- I'll sail again. One.
- OK.
- Maybe you can steer me home?
- Charge!
Pull pins!
Prepare to throw!
Throw!
- All right, fifth relay!
- What an arm!
Pick it up!
Right in the groove!
- Look, boy, this is a live grenade.
- Gee!
- You know what they can do?
- Yes, sir.
Right hand. Wait for the order to pull pin and pitch grenade.
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.
Ready?
Pull pin!
Prepare to throw!
Throw!
Grenade! Hit the deck!
When will you wake up? You wanna see her again, keep your mind on your work!
- What happened here?
- Little accident, sir.
You're wounded. Corpsman!
- Yes, sir.
- Take care of the sergeant.
Come right over here, Sergeant.
You may not know it, but you just got your life saved.
You'll get a medal.
Again the word came and the Marines moved out.
Again scuttlebutt knew a hundred destinations, all wrong.
This time we were a sound fighting unit, blooded and trained.
Tarawa had blooded us.
Stryker had trained us.
- Now, I'll show you something.
- What you got there?
- What does it look like?
- A flag.
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Occupy this island in the USA's name.
- You think we'll have an easy time?
- You got me with you.
- Maybe we need two of you.
- One was enough in Tarawa.
Stick with me.
I'm a battle-hardened veteran.
Know how many Japs I knocked off in Tarawa? 32. Did I get anything for it?
I got enemies in Washington.
If the Marines didn't have me, they'd never have made it.
Now, this is how you fold a flag!
Do you believe in intuition?
Yeah... in women. Why?
It's hard to explain. I've a feeling
I'm not coming out of this operation.
Don't talk that way.
- I can't help it. It's the way I feel.
- Why?
I don't know. It's like a voice in my ear.
I can't shake the feeling off.
Take my advice, shake it off.
No dice. When things like that get in you, it's no use trying to fight them.
If a marine waits long enough he gets the word.
Our sealed orders came aboard after five days at sea.
This island is volcanic and sandy.
It's five and a half miles long and two and a half miles wide.
This mountain here is a dead volcano. It's called Suribachi.
There's nothing on the island except three airfields and about 20,000 Japs.
The Army Air Corps B-24s have been bombing this place for 62 days.
- Maybe it'll be an easy operation then.
- We can't be sure.
Every yard is covered by some kind of fire.
There are two possible landing beaches, one on the east side, one on the west.
The rest of the coastline is cliffs.
They'll try and keep us off the beaches.
If they don't, they'll try and catch us at this first airfield, between the heights of Suribachi and these high rocky ridges in the north.
They'll shell us from both sides. Nobody knows what they've got on this island.
But they've had 40 years to put it there.
Saipan was our last stop.
The men who were going to hit the beach first transferred to LS Ts.
A few more days at sea and the time for landing came.
Saddle up!
Skip along and into the amtracs.
Anyway, it's a good day for it.
- It's cold.
- Stick around, it'll get warm.
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
Hey, look!
- Driver, you the joker that wrote that?
- "Semper fi", Mac!
We should take you in along with us.
Hey, McHugh's going in with his pocket full of books! Five books he's got!
So? The kid's a reader.
That shouldn't worry a dope like you.
When we're through with this operation,
I'm gonna break both your legs!
- I feel sick.
- I know. I felt the same way at Tarawa.
Hey, Stein, "Shalom aleychem".
Aleychem shalom.
- Sarge, I'm scared.
- So am I.
- Not you!
- Fowler, I'm always scared.
Line of departure! Get down!
Lock and load! Drop those lifebelts when we hit the beach!
All right, hit the beach!
It ain't Brooklyn!
If this place was a blanket
I'd pull it over my head!
This is the poorest soil I ever saw. What does anyone want an island like this for?
- That's war.
- What's war?
Trading real estate for men.
When God made the world, he must have put all the rubbish left over here.
Corpsman! Corpsman! Take it easy.
Doggone it, almost the same place they got me before!
Getting shot for this!
They're sure pouring it into Suribachi.
Not enough. Those Nips are shooting right down our throats.
- Stryker!
- Yo!
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.
- Lieutenant Shrier?
Stand fast.
- Stryker reporting, sir.
- I know.
Your platoon's been hit hard.
What's left has been assigned to me.
- Yes, sir.
- Naval gunfire lifts at 1100. Stand by.
Aye, aye.
Move out!
Keep your distance!
- Go on, go on!
- Corpsman! Corpsman! Corpsman!
Spread out! Dig in!
- Dunne, where's my brother?
- Back there. He's hit.
Flynn!
That's enough!
I told you you'd need this bad some day. Thanks, Marine.
Flynn! Get down!
- You ain't got the sense of a rabbit!
- You can still be a hero crawling!
- Corpsman!
- Ma'll dust me off if I don't get him back!
Harris!
Well, I'll get a good night's sleep tonight.
Corpsman!
He won't need him.
- Pillbox too big to handle with these.
- A bazooka?
- If we had one.
- I got nothing to do. I'll go pick one up.
Regazzi didn't make it.
You never know what's happening.
Listen.
- It's a tank.
- Yeah, but whose?
Ours!
It's Regazzi.
Pillbox at 2 o'clock.
OK, give 'em a hot foot!
Thanks, Mac.
- I couldn't find a bazooka.
- You did all right. Saddle up!
No one had ever seen anything like it.
No one would have believed it possible.
That smoking, miserable, bloody island.
After three days and three nights, and at the end of that time, we'd barely reached the foot of
Suribachi, where we were the first day.
- We'll sack here for the night.
- Best news today.
Pair off and one man awake at all times.
Keep alert. Let's go.
It'll start getting rough tomorrow against Suribachi.
It started getting rough when you put on that uniform.
You wanna see a good-looking kid?
Husky little boot. What's his name?
We're gonna name him Sam,
Sam Conway.
A name that's been awarded the Navy
Cross is good enough for any kid.
There's something I've been trying to say but... I can't find the words.
Two universities and you can't find the words to say you were out of line?
- OK, I'm out of line.
- No, you were. There's a difference.
We'd better get some sack time.
Wanna sleep first or watch?
- I'll watch.
- OK.
Everybody gets out of line once in a while.
Thanks, gyrene.
Where's Sergeant Stryker?
- Stryker?
- Right there.
- What do you want?
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.
- Stryker, sir.
- Yes, sir.
I'm taking a patrol up Suribachi.
Get your men squared away and be ready at 0700.
- The rendezvous is that Nip tank there.
- Aye, aye, sir, 0700.
That little voice whispering in your ear again?
Don't worry. I've known a million guys that have heard it.
Most of them make it. A few don't.
The percentage is on your side.
- Did you ever hear it?
- No.
- Don't you ever worry about it?
- What good would it do?
- You're indestructible.
- Stick close. It might rub off!
I'll do that.
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Patrol is ready to move. Request supporting fire.
Ow!
Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai elohenu...
Adonai echad.
Amen.
Radio!
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Over.
This is Easy Five. Cease fire, we're preparing to move over the top.
- Roger and out. Stryker!
- Yes, sir.
Colonel's ordered that we put up this flag when the top's secure. Get it there.
Aye, aye, sir.
What is this?
Put yours away.
This is the one we're gonna use.
First squad. Find something we can use as a standard and we'll put this up.
- Conway, you made it.
- I guess that little voice was wrong.
- I feel better.
- I feel better, too.
I never felt so good in my life.
How about a cigarette?
- Is he...?
- Yeah.
If he had to get it it's the way he'd have wanted.
It's a letter to his kid.
"Dear son, I guess none of my letters have reached you.
"I thought I'd try again as I'm feeling
"that this may be the last time I can write you.
"For a long time
I've wanted to tell you many things.
"Now that you're a big boy, I will.
"If we'd been together even for a while,
"I could've explained many things much better than writing them.
"You've gotta take care of your mother, and love her and make her happy.
"Never hurt her or anyone as I did.
"Always do what your heart tells you is right.
"Maybe someone will write you some day and tell you about me.
"I want you to be like me in some things, but not like me in others.
"When you grow older and get to know more about me, you'll see I've failed...
"...in many ways.
"This isn't what I wanted but things just turned out that way.
"If there was only more time I..."
Guess he never finished it.
I'll finish it for him.
There she goes.
All right, saddle up!
Let's get back in the war!
I hear them, Cheeta. I hear them.
Hiya, fellas!
Buli, look out.
Buli, Cheeta, it's a plane!
With a letter from Jane, maybe!
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Buli, go home.
Keep your eye on it, Cheeta!
Watch it, Cheeta! Watch it!
- Boy!
- Tarzan, over here!
Hurry, Cheeta! Hurry!
Cheeta.
Boy, hurry. Read letter from Jane.
All right, Tarzan. Don't get excited.
Boy excited, too.
"My darlings,
"I can't begin to tell you how much I miss you both
"and how happy I will be when this horrible war is over
"and I can come home to you again."
Tarzan happy, too.
"Many of the soldiers in the hospital where I am nursing
"have just been brought home from Burma
"and, in addition to their wounds, are suffering from jungle fever.
"It would be wonderful if you could send me some of the fever medicine
"which cured Boy when he was so ill,
"for I am certain that it would help our soldiers, too.
"You'll do this for me, won't you, Tarzan?"
Tarzan get. Read more.
Read more.
Boy, read more.
Now, let's see, where was I? Just a...
Oh, here I am.
Because the trip will take several days, you must not think of leaving
Boy and Cheeta this time.
The Great Desert will be very educational for them.
- Jane say Tarzan take Boy?
- That's right, Tarzan.
Read more what Jane say.
"And now I must say goodbye.
"Take good care of yourselves, my darlings,
"and remember that I love you
"and you are always in my thoughts and prayers.
"With all my love, Jane."
That's all, Tarzan.
- How soon will we be starting?
- What Boy say?
- Oh. Tarzan go tonight.
- Did you hear that, Cheeta?
We're gonna start right away!
Come on! Let's hurry!
My map's gone.
It was in this box.
Did you take it, Cheeta?
You didn't, huh?
Don't you know it's wrong to take things that belong to other people?
It's a bad habit.
You should be sorry.
Just think, Cheeta, we're gonna travel.
We're gonna see the Great Desert.
See this blank space here?
This is sand, nothing but sand.
This is where we are now, the escarpment.
Way across the desert is the fever medicine jungle.
Tarzan says it's full of wild animals and all sorts of mysterious things.
We might even see a city.
Here's El Ece Bra.
But it's miles and miles away from the fever medicine jungle.
Birherari here, it isn't so far away.
We might go there.
Tarzan's been to Birherari and so has Jane.
She's told me all sorts of things about the desert people there.
They wear clothes all the time.
Can you imagine that?
Heavy robes called a burnoose.
And things they wind around their heads they call turbans.
I bet you'd look funny in a turban.
We're gonna have lots of fun traveling across the desert.
Boy stay home.
Stay home?
- Fever medicine jungle dangerous.
- But I want to see Birherari!
Boy stay home.
But, Tarzan, Jane always said travel is very broadening.
Look, Tarzan, Cheeta wants to go, too.
All right. Boy and Cheeta come with Tarzan to edge of desert.
Then go home.
Desert no good place.
Jungle much safer than desert.
The Sheik has returned.
The devotion of your people is heartwarming, Sire.
I try to earn their love and respect.
In my own humble way, I, too, try to merit the approval of your people.
And failing that, you don't mind settling for their money, do you?
Selim, don't be rude.
Our friend here has brought much trade and prosperity to Birherari.
A philanthropist, I suppose.
A new role for you, eh, Hendrix?
I overlook your sarcasm.
Again I remind you that my offer to you still holds good.
You have only to speak to become my full partner.
Thanks. I'm not that easily bribed.
Selim, must you always argue thus?
I stand rebuked, my father.
Welcome home, Sire.
Did you have good hunting?
- We fared well. Look, look.
- The Sheik is a mighty hunter.
- It was he who bagged the biggest lion.
- And the fiercest.
Pardon.
Now, if you would excuse me, Sire.
Business, you know?
Business, always business.
No wonder the Hendrix enterprise is prospering.
- Hello, Karl.
- Herr Heinrich.
Idiot!
How many times must I tell you?
Here in Birherari call me Mr. Hendrix.
Sorry, it won't happen again.
- Did you also have good hunting?
- Excellent, as usual.
Sheik agreed I should also control the tobacco trade.
- Good. My congratulations.
- What's the news with you, Karl?
Oh, I manage to keep busy.
There was another visitor from El Ece Bra.
- Sightseer, no doubt?
- Yes.
He wanted to see Prince Selim.
I hope you were able to arrange a meeting.
- I was.
- Any complications?
None.
- Please. Please, Mr. Hendrix.
- What is it?
Is this what we get for one month's work at the looms?
- You get exactly what you earn, woman.
- Be on your way!
But for this we cannot buy enough to eat.
Then you should work a little harder.
Paul, the complaints are increasing, the people are growing restless.
- They talk of petitioning Prince Selim.
- He's a fool.
Suppose you let me worry about that?
Now, I have a more pleasant job for you.
On our way out of the jungle, we encountered a magnificent wild stallion.
The Sheik is very anxious to possess him.
Of course, and he would show his appreciation in a very practical way?
- Exactly.
- You may depend on me.
I'll bring in that stallion.
Tell men set horse free.
Now tell men set horse free.
All right, cut the stallion loose.
Men go.
Well, Tarzan, what are we waiting for?
Boy and Cheeta go back to escarpment now.
Tarzan, be a sport!
We want to help you get the fever medicine.
Jane ask Tarzan to get fever medicine.
Boy stay home.
Why, Tarzan, I don't remember reading anything like that in Jane's letter.
Then Boy read letter again!
Well, let's see.
Of course, you must not think of leaving
Boy and Cheeta this time.
The Great Desert will be very educational for them.
- Boy read letter like Jane say?
- Certainly, Tarzan, just like Jane say.
Why Boy lie?
Well, I had my fingers crossed.
It's lonesome on the escarpment without you, Tarzan.
All right.
Come, Cheeta.
Goodbye, Tarzan. Hurry home.
Boy wait.
Tarzan take.
Oh, Tarzan.
Look, Tarzan, it's the wild horse again.
He's thanking you, Tarzan.
Isn't he beautiful?
- Yes, beautiful.
- Let's take him with us.
No, horse want freedom just like everyone.
Go.
- Come, Boy.
- All right.
See, Tarzan? He wants to stay with us.
He's our friend.
- Please, let him come with us, Tarzan.
- All right.
Come on.
- I bet he wouldn't mind a bit if I rode him.
- No, horse wild.
Please let me try, Tarzan.
- All right, Boy try.
- Give me a boost.
- See? He's perfectly willing.
- Yes, horse willing.
We go to oasis, fill water bags.
That old yawner about this being a small world certainly ain't no lie.
A few weeks ago
I'm playing five-a-day stands in flea-bitten vaudeville houses.
Then, voom, I'm in Africa, entertaining the soldiers who chased Rommel out.
And then out of a clear blue sky
I'm hired by a handsome sheik to ride across yon burning desert sands on a secret mission.
What, change here for Schenectady?
From here you must proceed alone.
Don't tell me Paul Hendrix is out there, hiding behind one of those overgrown anthills.
Don't treat this matter too lightly,
Miss Bryce.
Two of my emissaries to Birherari have failed to return.
You don't have to worry about me.
Criminy, I mean, who in the world would suspect a gal magician with a vaudeville show that's strictly from hunger.
No one, I trust.
Oh, by the way, your friend, this Prince Selim,
- he speak the English, no?
- I think he'll be able to understand you.
Selim and I were educated in your country, at Yale.
Oh!
Boola boola, boola boola
Well, now, about this message.
Am I supposed to memorize it, or is it to be written on my back in invisible ink?
It is written within this.
Say, that's not a bad gag.
- Good luck, Miss Bryce.
- Thanks, Amir... Sheik Amir.
I'll be seeing you.
All right, boys, on your feet. Siesta's over.
Shake a leg with that java, boys.
We can't stay here all day.
If any more of my stuff falls off those camels,
I could start a magician's junkyard.
What do you want?
Because the English I so well speak,
I, Achmed Nogash Segali, by my friends to address you
- have been select.
- Shoot.
Is it true, O mystic lady, that one within this box placed may in half be sawn?
And afterward, in one piece put together be?
Well, if it isn't true, then I've died a thousand horrible deaths.
- What's on your mind, Rudy?
- This magic we wish to learn.
Oh, I get it. A free show, eh?
My friend Kushmet.
Three wives with the tempers of she-camels he possesses.
Upon two of which, the most homely, he would this strange magic perform with failure.
Thereby bending to his will the mind of the third.
Oh, brother, do you give the King's English the Saint Vitus' dance.
My friend Kushmet.
Look, Tony, rather than go through another one of your sentences,
I'll show you how it's done.
Free, gratis, for nothing.
Take the box and put it over here, fellas.
That's right.
Okay, Makushla... Kushmet, you and Charlie squatty-boo right there on the aisle.
No, Achmed, I need you for a stooge.
Now, all you have to do is when I get in here, you just saw away.
Kushmet. Couche.
- Okay, professor, saw away.
- May Allah be with you.
Oh, it's okay, Marty, it's okay.
Give her a couple of good ones.
Hey!
Hey, what goes on?
Hey, cut it out, you're clearing my pitch.
What do you think you're trying to do?
You idiot. You goggle-eyed moron!
Put me down.
Put me down!
- Girl all right?
- Of course I'm all right,
- you fugitive from a sideshow.
- Tarzan think girl hurt.
I ought to saw you in half, you meddling fool.
You've gone and chased those men off and with my horse, too.
Here I am in the middle of a desert, million miles from nowhere.
How do you expect me to get to Birherari now?
- Tarzan take.
- Oh, yes.
Well, just unroll your magic carpet and away we'll go.
Please, lady, don't be mad at Tarzan.
He was only trying to help you.
Say, what is this, a carnival act?
Ye Gods! And a monkey, too.
And unless I've got the blind staggers,
I'm looking at a horse.
Okay, Muscles, there's my Greyhound for Birherari.
Wait! Jaynar wild horse.
So what? I used to ride for a circus.
Well? How am I doing?
- Are you all right?
- Fine, fine.
I'll only spend the rest of my life eating off a mantelpiece.
You and your trick horse.
- Next time girl ask horse.
- Ask horse.
My bracelet. I've lost my bracelet.
Cheeta.
How many times must I tell you to leave other people's things alone?
Thanks.
All right. Rub your magic lamp and let's get on to Birherari.
- Tarzan stay here, rest.
- I'm not tired.
Tarzan rest.
Girl still mad.
I've never seen Jane act like that.
Jane smart. Jane know Tarzan too long.
Don't get mad.
Go away! Scat! You Mussolini, scat!
Flies, sand, mosquitoes, monkeys.
Human monkeys!
And a horse!
"Girl ask horse first."
A talking horse.
Maybe I'm crazy.
- Girl eat?
- For the 799th time, no!
- Good.
- I'm not hungry!
Besides, I wouldn't eat any of that desert duckling if I was starving to death.
Tarzan eat.
Hey! Lay off!
What's he trying to do, eat me?
The cannibal!
Hey, call him off! Don't just sit there.
Girl eat now?
Girl smart now. Smart like horse.
Okay, monkey.
Karl.
How many raiders did you say were in the party that stole the Sheik's stallion from you?
Oh, 15 at least, maybe 20.
Those?
- Well, you see, I...
- Don't strain yourself, Karl.
Nice of them to deliver the Sheik's present.
Don't tell me this is the end of the line.
Birherari.
I was afraid of that.
Well,
I've played worse places in one-night stands.
Well, goodbye, Tarzan.
Thanks for the ride, anyway.
Jaynar bring. Connie better thank him.
Yeah, that's right.
Thanks, Jaynar, old pal.
- Goodbye, Boy.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, now, Tarzan.
- Goodbye.
All right! Take a hold of that horse!
What's the trouble, Mr. Hendrix?
He stole this stallion intended as a present for the Sheik.
Man lie.
Tarzan rescued the horse.
They were whipping Jaynar.
All right, come along. You're under arrest.
But Tarzan hasn't done anything.
Has he, Connie?
What do you know about this?
Who, me? I'm just an innocent hitchhiker.
- Come!
- Tarzan!
Boy stay. Connie take good care of you.
- Me?
- Yes.
All right, if you feel that way about it.
By the way, I hope Mr. Tarzan is no particular friend of yours.
I should say not.
No, I pick my friends on the right side of the law!
Good. We'll get along, Miss...
My name's Connie Bryce.
I'm Paul Hendrix.
The big shot himself?
Well, I'm glad to meet you.
Say, where does a girl with a new family hang her hat around here?
Karl.
You'll see to it that my friend Connie and family have suitable quarters.
- I'll attend to it.
- Thanks.
- Come on, Boy. Come on, Cheeta.
- This way.
Magnificent!
- This is a gift worthy of a sultan!
- Your pleasure is my reward, Sire.
Selim, did you ever see a more superb animal?
It is a fine horse, Sire.
I'm afraid Prince Selim admires the gift a great deal more than the giver.
- There is something in what you say.
- That's enough.
You displease me very much!
Then I must humbly beg your forgiveness, Sire.
My friend, I must apologize for the manners of my son.
It is nothing. He's young, high-spirited.
- High-spirited like any thoroughbred.
- Thank you, my friend.
- Gee, Connie, I'm sure worried.
- You're worried?
Horse stealing is a mighty serious thing in this country.
- I hope they hang him!
- Connie!
I'm sorry, Boy. I didn't mean that.
But if it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be in this fix.
- Isn't there something we can do?
- Why, sure there is.
If I could just attract Selim's attention without Hendrix suspecting anything, well, we'd have Tarzan out of that clink before you could say Jack Robinson.
- Honest?
- I just said so, didn't I?
Why, it'd be a cinch.
If I had my props, I'd be out in that square doing a pitch right now.
- A pitch? What's a pitch?
- Oh, a show. An act, you know.
Fat chance I've got with all my stuff rotting out there in the middle of the desert.
Connie! I've got it!
I know how we can do a pitch.
And now, my friends, this little lady will perform a feat which has amazed the entire civilized world.
Unaided and alone, she will attempt to cross the tightwire blindfolded!
I'm sorry, Father. Really sorry.
But that man never fails to make my blood boil.
Why must you go out of your way to insult him?
I can't help it, Father. I don't like him.
- You're just prejudiced.
- No, it's more than that. He's an alien.
Haven't you noticed how he surrounds himself not with our people, but with men from the border tribes?
Why, he's employed hundreds of our people.
Yes, for the menial jobs.
But the men in his confidence, the bazaar managers, the foremen, the caravan leaders, are all outsiders.
I don't trust him, Father.
You mean, you don't trust your father's judgment, don't you?
Please, Father, I didn't mean that.
It's just that you're too good a man.
Too forthright and trusting to realize how ruthless and domineering he is.
Why, in America he'd be called a racketeer.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, this fearless little lady will attempt the daring, death-defying feat of turning a somersault on the high wire.
Watch her, ladies and gentlemen!
Watch Cheeta, the chimpanzee with the human mind, who will risk her life and limb for your edification and entertainment!
Okay, boys. Make with the music.
Boola boola, boola boola
Boola boola, boola boo<li>
Do you hear, Father?
It's a song from my university.
Well, I hear a strange conglomeration.
Excuse me, Sire.
Put faith in Eli Yale to win
We cannot fail
Boola boola boo, boola boola boo
Boola boo, boola boola boola boo
Boola boola, boola boola
Boola boola, boola boola
When we move in, oh, poor fellow
They will holler, "Boola boo"
- Nice going, chum.
- Say, where did you learn that song?
Oh, I've had a very liberal education.
I've been intercepting Yale passes for years.
You're a long way from home.
What brings you to Birherari?
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about a little later.
Fine. May I send for you this evening?
All right.
This is just so I'll know that it's your messenger.
Why all the mystery?
I'll tell you about that later.
All right, small stuff, you gotta get some shuteye.
- Shuteye?
- You know, sleep.
Oh, of course.
You sure
Tarzan's gonna be all right, Connie?
- Oh, sure, Boy.
- Then I'm sure, too.
- Good night.
- Aren't you forgetting something?
Am I? What?
Aren't you gonna say my prayers with me?
- What?
- Jane always did.
Well,
I'm a little out of practice.
You just repeat what I say.
- But I...
- Please?
- Dear Father who art in Heaven...
- Dear Father who art in Heaven...
...watch over me this night...
...watch over me this night...
...and protect me from evil.
...and protect me from evil.
Bless Tarzan and deliver him from those who would harm him.
Bless Tarzan and deliver him from those who would harm him.
Bless Jane so far away and the soldiers she nurses.
Bless Jane so far away and the soldiers she nurses.
P.S., God bless Connie, too.
P.S.,
God bless Boy, too.
Amen.
Amen.
Now you're supposed to kiss me good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, Cheeta.
Come in.
You wish an audience with Prince Selim?
Wait a minute.
Cheeta. Cheeta, give me the bracelet.
Give it to me, Cheeta.
Here, give it to me.
That's right. Thank you.
All right. Come on, Ali Baba, let's get going.
Come in.
- Well, hello.
- Hello yourself.
Still wondering how come
I sang your alma mater song?
Still wondering.
Well, a friend of mine suggested that it might be of interest to you.
An old college chum of yours.
Amir!
Well, his royal... What's his...
Sheik Amir of El Ece Bra.
How is the old so-and-so?
You know,
I haven't heard from him in months.
And yet Amir has twice sent couriers to you with confidential messages.
But I never received any such messages.
Well, wake up, chum.
There's dirty work at the crossroads.
- Somebody bumped those two guys off.
- But why?
Well, I don't know the real lowdown, but it's all here, including, I suppose, what Amir proposes to do about it.
Look.
You see, you have to press that back.
There.
I think this will finish Hendrix in Birherari.
I'll take this to my father right away.
Then my trip here has been a success.
You've taken a very great risk, and I'm very grateful.
I only wish there was something
I could do for you.
Oh, skip that.
Oh, say, you know, there is something you could do for me.
- Strictly as a friend.
- Just name it.
Well, it's about Tarzan, the jungle man, that was arrested today.
You mean the one who created such a disturbance in the square?
- But he's accused of stealing the stallion.
- Yeah, by Hendrix.
Tarzan's no thief.
- All right. I'll intercede for him.
- Thanks a million.
I'll ring for Hassan to show you out.
Oh, no. Don't bother.
I can find my way out.
- All right, Connie. Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Hendrix.
We must get that message.
- He's dead.
- He burnt the message.
Good. Saves me the trouble.
- Better call the guard.
- Call the guard?
Certainly.
There's been a murder, hasn't there?
And he practically promised to set Tarzan free.
Oh, Connie, aren't you glad now
I made you say your prayers?
I certainly am.
I think you got something there.
Why, Cheeta.
Where on earth have you been?
You're under arrest.
Under arrest? Are you kidding? What for?
For the murder of Prince Selim.
- But I just left him.
- I know that.
You were the only one who entered his quarters tonight.
You let me...
You leave Connie alone.
She hasn't killed anybody. Let me go.
We gotta help her, Cheeta.
Here. Give it to me. You'll lose it.
Come on.
...then we heard a muffled cry.
After a moment this woman ran out of the door and down the corridor.
We hurried into the room.
Prince Selim was slumped across his desk.
He had been stabbed in the back.
I didn't run out.
There wasn't a muffled cry.
They're telling a pack of lies.
The prisoner will kindly remain silent unless addressed.
- Can you confirm Mr. Hendrix's statement?
- Certainly.
As soon as we realized Selim was dead,
I called Hassan, summoned the guard.
Prince Selim did not say why he wished to speak to this woman?
No, Your Eminence.
Have you anything to say?
Only that I'm being framed!
They're trying to give me a fast shuffle!
I mean, I'm being accused of something that I didn't do!
Why did you
seek this audience with the Prince?
Well, I'd rather tell that to the Sheik. Personally.
The Sheik is in mourning for his son.
You can certainly speak freely to me.
Well, I had a note for Selim from Amir.
Indeed? And where is this note?
Well, I left it with Selim.
Did you discover any note when you examined the premises?
No, Your Eminence.
Did either of you see any sign of a note?
- I certainly didn't.
- Nor I.
Can't you see they're lying?
I suggest that this note is a figment of the murderess's imagination.
I'm afraid I'm inclined to agree.
In the name of my sheik,
I sentence you to be hanged by the neck until you're dead.
- What are you doing here?
- Please, sir, I want to see Tarzan.
- And the monkey, too?
- Please, mister.
- I can't. I've got no orders.
- But only for a few minutes.
Yeah. Well, all right, but only for a few minutes.
Thank you, sir.
Stand back.
- Why Boy and Cheeta here?
- Tarzan, they're gonna kill Connie.
- Kill? Why?
- Because she murdered somebody.
Connie? Kill someone?
No, she didn't. But they say she murdered the Sheik's son.
- Who say Connie do that?
- The same man that took Jaynar.
- And Connie says he's framing her.
- Framing?
Yes, that's American for blaming her for something she didn't do.
Why?
I don't know, but they're gonna hang her in the morning.
Open door! Open! Open door!
Stop that! Stop that or I'll shoot.
- Don't, Tarzan, he will shoot.
- Be quiet!
Quiet!
My turban!
We had more turban, we could make rope.
Slide down.
Cheeta.
Cheeta, Tarzan wants you to climb down and get lots of turbans.
Cheeta understand?
Give me my turban.
Your turban? I haven't got your turban.
- Where's my turban?
- Your turban?
- My turban!
- I haven't got your turban.
Cheeta! We thought you'd never get here.
We've got to hurry.
- Hang the murderer!
- Hang her!
Boy jump now.
Look, Tarzan, Jaynar.
Let the sentence be carried out.
Quick! Get our riders!
She mustn't escape and reach the Sheik Amir.
Boy, Cheeta, jump!
- What is it, Tarzan?
- Men near. Come!
Look! There's a hut.
Look like camel drivers' camp.
Looks like the Ritz to me.
Anybody home?
Say, this is cozy.
Look. Somebody even laid a fire.
One good thing about a whopping big storm like that, it certainly feels swell when it's over!
This is gonna make up for all that sand I swallowed.
Boy, am I relaxed!
Good to rest after struggle.
Good? It's heavenly!
You ought to see our house in the jungle.
It's really peaceful.
Boy wish he were home, eh?
Well...
Why don't you come and live with us, Connie?
Listen, you better not tempt me.
Cheeta says yes. What do you say, Tarzan?
Connie used to big cities.
Connie get lonesome here soon.
I've been lonesome all my life.
What's the matter, Boy?
Did I say something to upset him?
It's all right, Connie.
But, you see, Tarzan is lonesome, too.
For Jane.
Is that the girl you mentioned in your prayers?
Is she your mother?
- You both must love her very much.
- Of course, we do.
- Gee, she's a lucky girl.
- It's Tarzan and I who are the lucky ones.
Yeah, I suppose you are.
Everybody sleep now.
Start for medicine jungle in morning.
Connie sleep here.
That suits me just fine.
Boy sleep here.
Good night, Connie.
Good night, Boy.
Good night, Tarzan.
Good night.
- There's no one in here, Paul.
- Well, they were here.
Those hoofprints are fresh.
They've headed west.
Well, here we are.
A kid, a monkey, a horse thief and an accused murderess, all hunting for fever medicine.
Why can't you
take me to Sheik Amir now?
El Ece Bra far away. Go later.
But I want to get out from under that murder rap, and Amir is the only one who can help me.
Tarzan come for fever medicine.
Tarzan get.
Okay. Come on, kid, let's go.
Jungle dangerous.
Connie and Boy stay here.
Gee, Tarzan, I want to go with you.
I can help carry the vines.
Cheeta bring vines.
Boy help Connie fill waterskin.
- But can't I just...
- No! Tarzan hurry.
Cheeta, come!
Doesn't anybody ever win an argument with that guy?
Well, hardly ever!
Cheeta, come.
Cheeta! Come!
Cheeta, no touch flowers. Dangerous.
Come.
Stay here.
What's keeping him so long?
Every time I think of that rope necklace waiting for me at Birherari, I get the yips.
Cheeta, Connie and Boy...
Cheeta.
Connie, Cheeta's here.
You woke me up right in the middle of a nice, fat contract.
Forty weeks solid on Broadway.
Gee, Connie! I'm sorry.
That's okay, kid.
I've been having that dream for years.
Well, what do we do, now?
Squeeze the juice into the waterskin.
All right, Cheeta. Tarzan...
Goodbye, now. Hurry!
Cheeta, that's Connie's bracelet!
- Cheeta, give it to me.
- My bracelet?
Where did you get that?
Cheeta gave it to me the night they arrested you. I'd forgotten...
- Oh, wait, it's still here.
- What is it, Connie?
The note from Sheik Amir to Prince Selim.
How do you like that!
Amir is tipping the Sheik off that Hendrix is a crook and a foreign agent.
Amir says he can prove that Hendrix has been arming the border tribesmen so that he can take over the whole country.
And get this.
Unless the Sheik throws Hendrix out and disarms those border tribes,
Amir will ride on Birherari, and that will mean war.
If the Sheik reads this, he won't hang you.
He'll hang Hendrix.
You said it, kid.
This is gonna prove my innocence.
Come on.
We mustn't waste another minute.
We've gotta get this note to the Sheik right away.
What is it, Jaynar? What's the matter?
Connie! Look!
Jaynar, get out of sight.
Paul!
We gotta find Tarzan.
There they are. Come.
She's not to get away.
- You take those two men.
- Yeah.
You, come with me.
Quick, Connie. The tree.
Come on, Connie.
Connie, there.
There's another way out.
Boy!
Don't touch the web, Connie!
Don't touch it!
Connie! Boy!
Tarzan!
Connie, go!
In risking your life to bring the Sheik Amir's message, you averted bloodshed between his tribe and mine.
And I and my people will be forever grateful to you, Miss Bryce.
It was just my good deed for the day, that's all.
Well, Tarzan, old scout, what else can I do for you in London besides bringing Jane the fever medicine?
Tell Jane Tarzan very lonesome.
Send much love.
Okay, palsy-walsy!
- Goodbye, Boy.
- Goodbye, Connie.
Next to Tarzan and Jane, you're the swellest person I know.
You're 100% yourself.
Well, fellows,
I guess this is it.
So long, Tarzan! Bye, Boy!
Thanks for everything, Your Sheikness!
Tarzan and Boy go back to escarpment now.
And will I be glad to get there!
Come on, Cheeta! We're going home!
Cheeta! Where are you?
Oh, no. Not with me, you don't.

(# singing in French)
- Good evening, Vercheres.
- Sh!
Oh, good evening, Inspector. You have missed half of the opera, as usual.
- I didn't come to see the opera.
- As usual.
(applause)
- Raoul!
- Christine.
I just got back from Rouen.
No, I must talk to you for a moment.
But I...
Raoul, I shouldn't have left.
Christine, dear,
I hurried over to tell you something.
- What?
- That I love you.
- Again?
- Still.
- What a wonderful audience tonight.
- And you were marvellous, Biancarolli.
We're having supper tonight at the Café de L'Opéra.
- I'm sorry, Raoul, but I can't tonight.
- Why not?
Chris? Christine!
- I'm coming, Jenny.
- If you've another engagement, break it.
You've had your fling at this for two years.
But I don't want to give up the opera, not until I've had a chance to really sing.
Anatole says he has great faith in my voice, and he's going to help me.
Naturally. That's what baritones are for(!)
- You were in wonderful voice tonight.
- Thank you, Marcel.
Christine! Why weren't you on the stage for the end of the act?
- You're all right?
- Oh, yes.
Mademoiselle DuBois, come here please.
Don't worry.
Why weren't you onstage for the curtain calls?
- Well, erm, I was ill...
- No, you were not.
You were entertaining a friend.
A friend, mind you!
For a singer to absent herself from the stage during a performance is a gross breach of...
- Oh. You wish to talk to me, monsieur?
- With your permission,
I'd like a few words with MIle DuBois in my office after the performance.
- Yes, she will be there.
- Thank you.
- Now, you bear in mind what I told you.
- Yes, monsieur.
Terrifying fellow, that Vercheres, when he wants to be.
I'm very grateful, monsieur. I promise you
I'll never miss a curtain call again.
It's a promise. Now, uh, this young man who is more important to you than your career... Who is he?
But he isn't, monsieur. That is,
I am very fond of him. I mean...
Oh.
Well, he's Inspector
Raoul Daubert of the Sûreté.
Inspector? You mean a policeman?
Oh, but he's not an ordinary policeman.
Even an extraordinary policeman seems a strange sweetheart for a soprano.
Does he sing?
I'm afraid you don't understand, monsieur.
He's a graduate of the military academy at Saint-Cyr, and he's very intelligent and very clever.
For a man who means nothing to you, he seems to have made quite an impression.
Oh, but I didn't say he meant nothing to me. What I said was...
I know. I know what you mean.
You have promise, Mademoiselle DuBois, but you must choose between an operatic career and what is usually called "a normal life".
Though why it is so-called is beyond me.
You can't do justice to both.
The artist has a special temperament, and he must live his life exclusively with those who understand it.
I understand, monsieur.
You'll find that music has its compensations, my dear. Good night.
Good night, and thank you.
Oh, mademoiselle, please tell Mr Claudin to come in. He's in the anteroom.
Certainly. Good night.
Good evening. Monsieur Villeneuve asks that you come in now.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle, may I speak to you for a minute?
Certainly.
You weren't on the stage tonight for the third-act curtain calls.
Everyone in the theatre seems to have noticed it. It's really quite flattering.
Why weren't you there?
Oh, forgive me, but I've been here so long that you...
Everybody, everything connected with the Opera is so much a part of my life.
Of course... But Mr Villeneuve is waiting.
Yes.
You weren't ill, were you?
You're not in any trouble?
It's impertinent of me, I know, but, uh...
You're very kind.
Good night.
Uh, Christine!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Good night.
Good night.
- (knocking)
- (Villeneuve) Come in, please.
You know why I sent for you, Claudin?
I think so, Maestro.
For some time now I have sensed discord in the violin section.
It was not until tonight that I definitely located the source of the trouble.
Let me hear you play, if you please, Claudin.
Yes, Maestro.
(# mournful tune)
- What was that, Claudin?
- A little song.
A lullaby, from Provence, where I was born.
You played it very well.
Perhaps I was wrong.
No, it was you.
What's the matter?
You're an accomplished musician.
Come, come, now.
Let me hear you play the opening movement in the third act of Martha. 
It's no use, Maestro. Something has happened to the fingers of my left hand.
- But you played that lullaby perfectly.
- It's a simple melody, Maestro.
That's why I played it.
You were trying to fool me, eh, Claudin?
Well, perhaps it's only temporary.
Perhaps it'll get better.
I hope so, but in the meantime...
You know, Claudin, the aim of the Paris Opera is perfection.
I'm sorry, old fellow, very sorry. You've been with us a long time, haven't you?
20 years.
What am I to do, Maestro?
I know it's hard, Claudin.
No doubt you've saved a tidy little fortune to retire on.
- Yes, of course.
- In appreciation of your long service,
I shall arrange with the directors to have a season ticket issued to you.
Thank you, Maestro.
(knock at door)
(door opens)
Why don't you eat before the opera, instead of keeping me up all hours?
You're rich enough. Same soup, night after night, week after week.
- Please don't disturb yourself, Marie.
- You're a fine one to say that!
Why wouldn't I be disturbed?
I'll come right to the point.
What you do with your money is not my business.
If you want to hoard it and starve, it's your affair.
But you haven't paid me for six weeks, and that's as long as I'm going to wait.
I haven't any money.
If you'll be patient, just a little longer...
You haven't any money? After working for the Paris Opera all these years?
What will you do with your money?
Bury it with you?
If you do, they'll dig you up and steal it.
If you think you can add a few francs to your fortune at my expense, you're very much mistaken.
Marie, you've been very kind, you've been very patient. You'll be paid, I promise you.
Now please leave me alone.
It makes me sick to think of all that money doing nobody any good.
Either I get my money or out you go.
That's my last word, Claudin.
(# sings ascending scale)
(bell tinkles)
You're late, Mr Claudin.
The lesson is almost over.
I didn't come about that today, mademoiselle.
- She's not in voice.
- I'll tell Signor Ferretti.
- Please don't interrupt the lesson.
- Of course not. I understand.
But I must announce the time to Signor
Ferretti, or he'll keep students for hours.
- It's 11 o'clock, Signor Ferretti.
- Thank you.
Mademoiselle, you disappoint me.
I'm sorry. I'm a little upset.
If a man is upsetting you, pitch him out of your life. Music is first.
- Music is everything.
- I understand.
You don't understand. Women never understand. But they are docile.
Perhaps you're not getting enough sleep.
Come later tomorrow, say midday.
Thank you, monsieur.
Remember you have responsibilities to others as well as yourself.
I know.
I can never repay you for what you've done for me.
- Good day, monsieur.
- Good day.
Would you come this way, monsieur?
Monsieur Claudin is here, Signor Ferretti.
Come in, Claudin, come in.
- Won't you sit down a moment?
- Thank you.
I suppose you noticed your protégée was disappointing today?
Well, an off day now and then.
You've done a lot for her, Signor.
Nevertheless, she is making definite progress, eh?
I was dismissed from the orchestra last night.
Oh. Then you will have to withdraw your support for Mademoiselle DuBois?
Only for a little while, just until
I can secure another position.
I had hoped that you would continue to instruct her.
Claudin, if you don't mind me saying so, you are a fool.
A man of your age might win a girl like Christine DuBois if he happened to be the director of an opera company, but a poor violinist...
We agreed never to discuss my motives.
Please, won't you continue to work with her?
Why should I assume your burden, after you spent all your money on her?
She means nothing to me.
But her career means more to me than anything else.
I would never let you lose anything on her account.
I'm sorry, Claudin, really sorry.
If I had time... But my expenses are great.
And you must remember there are many who can pay waiting to study with me.
I'll let her come a few times, and then
I will tell her she no longer needs me.
But that isn't true.
As a matter of fact, if you had the money, she might be launched on a career soon.
I assume that MIle DuBois has not the means to pay for her own instructions?
A month's salary wouldn't be enough to pay for one of your lessons.
But... I have written a concerto.
Will you trust me if I can arrange to have it published?
Every violinist has written a concerto!
Come, come, my dear Claudin.
But I have faith in this one, as much faith as I had in MIle DuBois when I came three years ago.
Now, I was right about her,
Signor, and I'm right about this.
Pleyel and Desjardins will publish it, and they'll give me a substantial advance. You'll see!
(man) It's a shame.
Pleyel's in there with his etchings.
Why don't they tell the poor devil he won't see anyone, instead of torturing him?
Claudin?
He'll see me?
No. He is too busy today.
- Has he seen my manuscript?
- Manuscript? What manuscript?
- My concerto.
- I know nothing about it.
- But you took the portfolio into him.
- If I did, you will receive it in due time.
Now, my dear, the acid. Be careful, or you'll burn yourself horribly.
- Monsieur Pleyel?
- What are you doing here?
- I've been waiting since this morning.
- Weren't you told I couldn't see anyone?
Yes, but my manuscript.
I must find out about my manuscript.
Give this fellow his manuscript, Georgette.
You'll find it on the desk, if it's anywhere.
- What is your name?
- Uh, Claudin. Erique Claudin.
Claudin...
No, it wouldn't be there. It's a large manuscript in a portfolio. It's a concerto.
- I'm sorry, but I don't know where it is.
- But it must be here.
Well, if it is, it will turn up.
You might call again in a few days.
You don't understand. It's my only copy.
It represents two years' work.
- You heard what the lady said.
- But it was brought in.
It must be here. It must be found.
Did we ask you to bring your music to us, Claudin?
I've seen samples of your compositions before.
Perhaps some employee has thrown it into the wastebasket, where it belongs.
Good night!
(# piano playing)
- Do you think I was right, Monsieur Liszt?
- It's magnificent. Tell me his name again.
- Erique Claudin.
- Claudin?
I've tried for years to persuade
Pleyel to publish his work, but you know
Pleyel and unknown composers.
Pleyel will publish this, I promise.
(continues playing piano)
That's my music.
I thought I told you to get out.
Thief!
You've stolen my music.
- Thief!
- (Georgette) Maurice!
- You're choking him!
- You've stolen my music!
Thief! Thief!
- (Pleyel chokes)
- You've stolen my music!
What happened?
- Stop him!
- What's happened?
Monsieur Pleyel's been murdered by that madman, Claudin! Get a doctor, quickly!
You, get a doctor. Call the police!
Get a doctor! Call the police!
Police! Police!
- What happened?
- Monsieur Pleyel has been murdered!
- He ran down that way.
- Come on, let's go!
Not here.
Sorry, monsieur.
Move on, and don't come back into this district tonight.
(howls)
Lecours, how were we ever induced to accept the management of this place?
It's not an opera house. It's a madhouse.
And now this:
"Wanted for murder: Erique Claudin, former violinist at Paris Opera House."
"Age 48 years, height 5ft 8in."
"The face has recently been disfigured by acid."
It's an outrage.
After 20 years with the Paris Opera, this miserable Claudin has the insolence to commit a murder.
After 20 years with the Paris Opera,
- A man is capable of anything, Amiot.
- (knock on door)
Come in, come in, come in!
Monsieur, there is a thief in the opera house.
A costume has been stolen, and two masks.
Impossible. The wardrobe woman must have lost them.
- She should have been dismissed.
- She's too fat.
That's not all. The thief has broken into the restaurant.
- The restaurant?
- Yes, monsieur. There is missing a...
There is missing a bucket of pickled pigs' feet in vinegar, a ham and a pâté.
Call the police. This must be stopped.
Monsieur, I am afraid the police can't stop that. It's he.
Who?
Oh, please don't start that nonsense again, Vercheres.
You ought to know there aren't any ghosts.
Monsieur, you are sceptical, but
I don't like ghosts. I am a busy man.
What's that?
Our brilliant stage manager insists there's a malicious ghost prowling about.
If anything goes wrong, he thinks this ghost did it.
Oh, monsieur...
- It has a long nose and a big, red beard.
- You make me nervous.
It's gone!
Did you hear that, Lecours?
My master key is gone.
Do you realise what that means, Lecours?
With that key in his possession, the thief can open 2500 doors, to say nothing of thousands of closets and cabinets.
Perhaps the pickled pigs' feet will kill him.
Oh, you don't seem to understand.
Why, he can hide everywhere.
The entire police force couldn't find him.
You don't realise the extent of this place.
You've never troubled to find out.
Why should I? I have troubles enough.
- What are you waiting for? Get the police!
- Yes, monsieur.
A pâté, a ham, pickled pigs' feet and 2500 rooms!
What is the Opera coming to?
(# angry chords)
(# "Provence Lullaby")
(# hums the tune)
That's lovely. What is it?
It's a lullaby of Provence.
I've known it all my life.
# Hear those bells ringing soft and low
# Bringing peace through the twilight glow
# According to everyone
# Night has begun
# Turn from your weary toil
# Day's work is done
# Hear them ring while my love and I
# Drift and dream to the lullaby
# Hear those bells ringing soft and low
- (bell)
- # Bringing peace
# Through the twilight glow
# According to everyone
# Night has...
- Monsieur Daubert.
- Madame.
They call this rehearsing, monsieur.
Well, I'm sorry to intrude, but I must see you, Christine.
- Well, you see I'm busy right now...
- Christine!
Please remember that you are speaking to a gentleman.
Well, uh...
- Come in, Raoul.
- Rehearsals!
Anatole... Well, he's been helping me.
- Monsieur's very kind.
- Not at all, monsieur. I find it a pleasure.
- I'm Anatole Garron of the Opera.
- I'm so sorry.
This is Inspector Daubert, of the Sûreté.
I've heard of you, Inspector.
Your work must be very exciting.
Oh, not so exciting as yours, monsieur.
It doesn't lend itself to self-expression.
I didn't recognise that delightful song you were singing.
But as you know,
I am no connoisseur of the opera.
It's not from an opera, Raoul. It's a lullaby.
A lullaby?
It didn't seem very effective, as a lullaby.
Well, you see, Monsieur Inspector, a song is capable of many interpretations,
- By a musician.
- By a detective, too.
Though no doubt the detective is usually mistaken.
I must see you alone, Christine.
I'm here on business from the Sûreté.
With me?
What business could mademoiselle have with the Sûreté?
What is it, Raoul?
If you don't mind,
I'd rather Anatole stayed.
Very well, Christine.
- You know Erique Claudin?
- Why, yes.
How well?
I knew him only as a violinist in the orchestra.
I encountered him a few times in the foyer or on the stage or outside the Opera, but that's all.
He acted a little strangely, but I assumed he was that way with everybody.
- Strangely?
How do you mean, "strangely"?
Well... I don't know.
He just seemed... eccentric, but harmless.
I thought he was a rather kind old fellow, until I read of the murder.
- What is it, Raoul?
- He was a kind and inoffensive man.
Until he thought Pleyel was stealing his life's work.
Then something snapped, and he became a homicidal maniac.
In his state, he may commit other murders.
It's urgent that we capture him as soon as possible.
But what has all this to do with me?
We found something in his room that connects you with him.
No doubt you can explain.
So that's what became of it!
- Be good enough to explain yourself.
- Certainly. That statuette is mine.
- Yours?
- Definitely. I made it.
- I intended to make you a present of it.
- How nice of you, Anatole.
It disappeared from my dressing room.
It's an extraordinary likeness.
My compliments on your versatility, monsieur.
You must have posed for this many times. Every detail is you.
I never posed for it, not once.
- You did this from drawings?
- And from memory, Monsieur Inspector.
To see Christine is to carry her image in your heart and mind for ever.
- Claudin must have stolen it.
- Why?
Isn't it obvious?
Well, speaking purely as an inspector of the Sûreté, even the obvious often needs confirmation.
But as a man, Mr Daubert, you can understand that sitting there in the orchestra pit night after night and looking at Christine,
Claudin probably fell in love with her.
You admit that is possible, no?
Christine, did Claudin ever seek more than a casual acquaintance with you?
No, never.
Can you imagine so diffident a lover, monsieur? Claudin was barely 50.
Well, no doubt he lacked... assurance.
No doubt.
- This is yours, Christine.
- You're giving it to me?
- Yes.
- Well!
Then I'll accept it as a gift from both of you.
Well, I seem to have got the worst of this bargain.
In the future, Monsieur Inspector,
I detect, you model.
- In any case, that was a bad clue.
- Oh, not so bad as it seems.
It enabled me to recover mademoiselle's statuette.
Thank you, Raoul.
Is that your carriage at the door, monsieur?
Why, yes.
Would you be good enough to give me a lift?
- Where are you going?
- It doesn't matter.
As inspector of police,
I have business all over Paris.
Yes, well, in that case...
- Au revoir,  Christine.
- Au revoir. 
You've been most helpful, Christine.
- I hope you catch him soon.
- Thank you.
- Ready, monsieur?
- At your service.
- After you, monsieur.
- After you,  monsieur.
(laughs)
(orchestra tuning up)
- Madame looks beautiful tonight.
- Don't I always, Yvette?
But especially tonight. Monsieur Garron, if he has eyes in his head...
- (knocking)
- (man) Madame Biancarolli!
Thank you! Madame...
(practises vocal exercises)
Good evening.
Marcel, do you think
I lead an enviable life?
- Yes, monsieur.
- I do, but not for the reasons you think.
I'm a very happy man because I'm having supper tonight with Mademoiselle DuBois.
(Claudin) Christine?
You're going to be a great and famous singer. I'll help you.
(# singing in French)
Marie, Comtesse de Bretonne. 
(# singing in French)
(Garron) Christine, you're going to be a great and famous singer. I'll help you.
- What's the matter?
- Someone just said the same thing to me
- A moment ago, in my room.
- Someone? Who?
I don't know. It was... just a voice.
- I knew you'd hear me sooner or later.
- It was you?
Of course. I don't mean actually, but I've been saying it ever since I saw you and heard you sing. At last you heard me.
- Your cue, monsieur.
- I'll tell you again at supper.
Armand, Duc de Montaigne. 
(applause)
What is it, madame?
I don't know. I...
Help me!
Monsieur Vercheres!
Oh, madame!
You, get a doctor, quickly.
Take her to her dressing room.
- What could have happened?
- What?
Ohh!
MIle DuBois, you must go on at once.
Madame Biancarolli has been taken ill.
Please get changed quickly. Claire!
Where is that clumsy wardrobe woman?
Claire, get MIle DuBois changed at once.
There isn't a moment to lose.
She was drugged, there's no doubt.
- Who the devil would want to drug her?
- I'm sure she overate.
- You're certain she'll recover, Dr Lefours?
- Definitely.
What am I doing here?  I...
I should be onstage. I...
- Doctor!
- Madame...
She'll be all right now.
Camarades, I'empereur nous appelle. 
(# Christine sings)
Why is she singing?
What is she doing out there?
- What's happened?
- Madame, control yourself.
- I assure you...
- Come to the point, Amiot.
You were seized with a touch of indigestion.
As your understudy,
MIle DuBois took your place.
A touch of indigestion! Why, I was perfectly well when I went on the stage.
Why, I was drugged!
And you all know by whom.
Anatole Garron did it to make room for that baggage!
- Madame, consider what you're saying,
- Madame, please compose yourself.
I demand Garron's arrest.
And hers too. She had a hand in it.
I demand an investigation!
- Let me go!
- Madame, consider our position.
You were wonderful!
(cheering)
I assure you, monsieur. The property man swears that there was no opportunity for any human being to tamper with the drink.
Monsieur Inspector, what are you waiting for?
I demand the arrest of Anatole Garron.
You know he did it.
I know nothing of the sort, madame.
I am a police officer, not a psychic.
It is my duty to collect evidence, without prejudice.
Haven't you evidence enough?
Everyone knows...
Madame!
Will you be seated, please?
Mr Garron, you had the opportunity to put the drug in Madame Biancarolli's glass.
Certainly, Monsieur Inspector.
We all did.
- It becomes, then, a question of motive.
- The motive is very simple, monsieur.
He wanted to get me out of the way so he could make room for that...
- Are you referring to MIle DuBois?
- I am.
You heard, Monsieur Garron.
Madame is in good voice... and most explicit.
Have you anything to say, monsieur?
I deny madame's accusation.
Do you deny, monsieur, that you had any motive in drugging madame?
I deny that I drugged her.
I don't understand your reluctance to make the arrest, Inspector.
- You're not an examining magistrate.
- Can you substantiate that Mr Garron had a motive, and that the motive was MIle DuBois?
- Anyone with half an eye could tell you...
- Hearsay is not evidence, madame.
I'll go over your head, Monsieur Daubert.
I have influence at the Sûreté.
I was drugged tonight to the point of death.
I insist upon the arrest of the criminal and his accomplice.
- And if you don't, I...
- One moment, madame, please.
You have heard Mr Garron deny that he drugged you.
As the inspector says, there is no evidence.
- And remember, madame...
- Are you suggesting that I...
If you insist upon his arrest and fail to obtain a conviction, you will find yourself in a very difficult predicament.
- Quite right.
- And no matter what the outcome, don't forget that your career is bound to the Paris Opera.
Whatever scandal injures us, or any member of the company,
- Will injure you as well.
- (Lecours) Precisely.
Are you suggesting that
I forget the whole affair?
Yes. For your own sake, as well as ours, and purely as a matter of business expediency.
That is exactly what we propose, madame.
(Lecours) Exactly.
Very well.
That is, under certain conditions.
I want a new understudy.
Christine DuBois goes back to the chorus and stays there for the two years my contract has to run.
I won't permit such an outrage!
If any such arrangement is made, I'II...
- Now, madame...
- My dear Anatole, I have not finished.
You suggest I forget
I was drugged tonight?
- Madame.
- Very well. I'll go a step further.
I suggest that you forget anything happened afterwards.
- For once, madame, I do not understand.
- Oh, monsieur, it's so simple.
Nothing happened tonight. I wasn't drugged and Christine DuBois didn't sing.
- But...
- There are always critics in the house.
You'll send word to the papers that no mention of her is to be made.
You'll do nothing of the sort.
It's ridiculous.
Besides, what about the public, madame?
Shall we send word to the public to forget that MIle DuBois was a sensation?
If you're willing to ruin the Opera for the sake of Christine DuBois, it's your affair.
But you'll either do as I say, or I'll charge both of them with trying to murder me.
Do you understand that? Murder me!
- Madame was magnificent tonight.
- I was good, wasn't I?
Monsieur Garron must be biting his nails.
Ah, let him. He'll come crawling back to me on his hands and knees, confessing the whole thing and begging my forgiveness.
Madame!
Who are you?
Christine DuBois will sing tomorrow night.
Leave Paris. This is your last warning.
Take off that prop-room mask.
(screaming)
- What was that?
- I don't know.
- (man) Something must have happened.
- Silence, please.
- (woman) What happened?
- Sh! Monsieur?
Madame Biancarolli and her maid have been murdered.
Murdered?!
- Are you hurt, monsieur?
- What happened? What were you doing?
- I was chasing him.
- Chasing whom?
The murderer, of course.
There was someone else up there?
Certainly. Everyone must have seen...
You saw him yourself, didn't you?
No, monsieur. I was chasing you. 
How long will the Opera remain closed, Inspector?
- Yes, how long?
- I do not know.
- Any suspects?
- Yes, whom do you suspect?
- No one.
- What is your theory on the motive?
I am not a theorist. All I can say is that as long as the opera house remains closed, everyone in Paris, in all France, will think only of the murder, hounding us to make an arrest.
Inspector Daubert.
I came directly I got your message.
What has happened now?
Listen to this, monsieur.
"Christine DuBois must replace
Biancarolli, who ignored my warning."
I found this mysteriously placed on my desk after we got back from supper.
There is an excellent suggestion in this, monsieur. You must reopen the Opera.
- But your orders...
- Are countermanded. Reopen.
- With MIle DuBois, monsieur?
- Of course! It should pacify this madman.
If he doesn't harm anybody, his being in the building doesn't matter.
- Christine DuBois must not sing.
- What?
And the murderer must not remain in the building.
- It is my duty to apprehend him.
- I don't understand.
If Christine DuBois sings, that will satisfy the murderer, and he may never appear.
To lure him from his hiding place, someone else must sing.
Are you suggesting we reopen the Opera with a murder as an added attraction?
- Please, Lecours...
- I'll post police throughout the building.
Even with the chorus onstage, with a bodyguard for the singer.
- But, monsieur, our reputation...
- I am reluctant to do this, monsieur.
Particularly on MIle DuBois' account, but I can see no other way.
And whom do you suggest as "bait",
Monsieur Inspector?
Whomever you decide.
Madame Lorenzi.
She has nerve, that woman.
- Too much.
- Very well, then.
- The Opera will reopen.
- Yes, monsieur.
(bell)
- Oh.
- (both) Good morning, Christine.
- Good morning.
- (both) May I come in, Christine?
Yes, do.
- Well?
- (both) Christine, I...
- Yes?
- (both) If I might have a word...?
- Well, what is it?
- After you, monsieur.
- (both) Christine, I...
- Well, now, one at a time, please!
You first, Anatole, as your name begins with an A.
They're going to reopen the Opera.
At last we will sing...
You are wrong, monsieur.
I'm sorry, Christine.
They are going to reopen the Opera, but without you.
Circumstances connected with the murder demand that someone else sing the leading role.
- But Anatole...
- You may like to know, monsieur, that circumstances connected with the murder demand that she does sing.
Really? I am aware that your profession requires a certain self-assurance,
- But aren't you going too far?
- Not at all.
I have a plan for apprehending the murderer.
- So you have turned detective, monsieur?
- I have.
Very well, if it amuses you, but I advise you to confine your hobby to the entertainment of your friends.
Well, let's not waste words, monsieur.
I've been assured by
Messrs Amiot and Lecours that as soon as the Opera reopens,
MIle DuBois will sing.
And I might add that my plan is strictly confidential.
I'm sorry, but in my official capacity
I ordered Messrs Amiot and Lecours not to permit you to sing.
- But Raoul...
- At least, not for the present.
And I am not in the least interested in your plan.
May I have a word with you alone?
That's what I came for.
May I speak to you alone?
- But... I'm going out.
- (both) My carriage is outside.
Well, I'm not going right now.
I mean... I'm going later.
(both) I'll wait.
Mr Villeneuve suggested you'd perform this service in the cause of justice.
Do you think Claudin would be tempted to leave his hiding place and risk his life merely to hear his own concerto?
Played by Franz Liszt himself?
Do you doubt it, Maestro?
So many crimes have been committed in the name of music.
It seems only fair to use it now to avert one.
- I am at your service, monsieur.
- Thank you, Maestro. Thank you.
Most exciting, this detective work, most exciting.
It's more than exciting to me. I had the honour of being suspected of the crime.
Monsieur Daubert, please.
- Listen, monsieur.
- Another note.
How this phantom knows everything is beyond me.
"If Madame Lorenzi sings, you are responsible for what happens."
Our plan is working.
I don't like it, monsieur. What will become of the Paris Opera? Police everywhere!
- How is Madame Lorenzi?
- Oh, she's enjoying it.
- Nothing would keep her from singing.
- Well, you know how opera singers are.
With your matron in her dressing room and that fellow of yours waiting to escort her to the stage, she feels quite important.
Madame Lorenzi,
I trust you are entirely composed?
Composed?
What are you talking about? Why not?
- Maestro!
- The piano has been tuned, Maestro.
- When do we introduce the concerto?
- Probably after the opera.
Inspector Daubert has a plan of his own, and we must give it every chance.
You may enjoy seeing the opera from the orchestra pit.
I'll be quite comfortable here.
I can look through the score.
- Excuse me. The overture.
- Thank you again, Maestro.
Remain onstage throughout the performance.
Make yourselves inconspicuous, and be on the alert for anything suspicious.
The only persons backstage are the members of the opera company, all of whom you know. Now, that is all.
(# overture begins)
Christine, I'd rather you'd stayed at home.
You understand why
I asked them not to let you sing?
But I couldn't stay away.
We're introducing a new opera
- And Madame Lorenzi's a great artist...
- And Anatole Garron is the baritone!
I'm sorry, Christine, but I'm concerned about what may happen tonight.
I know. I am too.
Wait for me, please, in your dressing room.
(# singing in Russian)
Sorry.
He's here, Gerard. He murdered one of our men and stole his cape.
He's probably wearing a mask.
Watch everyone closely.
Of course, monsieur.
Sorry.
(# singing in Russian)
(# sings in Russian)
(# Madame Lorenzi sings)
(screams)
(screaming and shouting)
What is it?
Come with me, mademoiselle.
Are you one of the police?
- Where is Inspector Daubert?
- Investigating the accident.
I will look after you.
- You're not one of the police.
- I'll watch over you.
- I've always watched over you. Come.
- (screams)
- (screams)
- Sh!
Shh.
You'll stay here with me, my child, won't you?
It's been so Ionely without you, but you've come to me at last, haven't you?
Now you'll sing for me, and I'll play, and we'll be together for ever.
It's beautiful down there.
Beautiful.
Come now, my little one.
Christine!
- Where's Christine?
- I don't know. Isn't it horrible?
- Hasn't she been here?
- I haven't seen her.
There. You're not frightened now, are you?
You know I'll not harm you, don't you?
How could I harm you?
I've always helped you, haven't I?
- Yes.
- Yes what?
Yes, you've always helped me.
Of course I have. Biancarolli knows.
She wouldn't let you sing.
She didn't know how much I love you.
Now she knows.
But it doesn't matter now. Nothing matters except you and me, Christine.
Now you'll sing all you want... but only for me.
You will, won't you, my darling?
Of course.
There's a piano in the Opera foyer.
Let's go there.
You play and I'll sing for you.
But you don't understand.
We can't go back there... ever.
It was I who made the chandelier fall. l, for you, Christine.
But I warned them. I said there'd be death and destruction if they didn't let you sing.
Come.
See? Didn't I tell you it was beautiful?
You didn't know we had a lake all to ourselves, did you?
They've poisoned your mind against me.
That's why you're afraid.
Look at your lake, Christine. You'll love it here, when you get used to the dark.
And you'll love the dark too.
It's friendly and peaceful.
It brings rest, and relief from pain.
It's right under the Opera. The music comes down and the darkness distils it, cleanses it of the suffering that made it, then it's all beauty.
And life here is like a resurrection.
This is more than just a performance of a new concerto.
The future of the Paris Opera may depend upon it.
- Garron, have you seen Christine?
- No, she's at home.
She came to the opera house earlier this evening. Now she's disappeared.
Play, Maestro. Play.
Christine? Christine!
Christine! Christine!
Christine!
George, you two search that passageway.
Gerard, go that way.
Be careful.
This madman may do anything now.
Christine!
Christine!
(# Claudin's concerto begins)
My concerto!
(# plays along with concerto)
Liszt is playing.
That was a brilliant idea of yours, Garron.
Claudin may be up there now, listening.
That sounds in front of us.
It is in front of us.
The whole place is ready to crumble.
Sing, Christine.
Sing!
Don't move.
- The whole place is caving in.
- The shots must have started it.
He called that his concerto, and yet it's written around the melody of my song.
- Who was he?
- He came from your district, in Provence.
Everybody there must have known that old folk song.
He was almost a stranger to me, and yet... somehow I always felt drawn to him with a kind of pity, understanding.
His suffering and madness will be forgotten.
His music, his concerto, will remain.
I'm glad he heard it, before he...
Poor Claudin.
Oh, mademoiselle, you were magnificent tonight!
Thank you, Celeste. I was good, wasn't I?
Oh, wonderful!
- (knock on door)
- Celeste!
Monsieur.
You were magnificent, Christine!
- Incomparable, beautiful-a sensation!
- Is that all?
I've just begun. It would take days and years to tell you how superb you were.
We're having supper tonight at the Café de L'Opéra.
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
Anatole, but I can't tonight.
Why not? Have you another engagement?
- Yes.
- With whom?
With Raoul.
- That policeman?
- (knock at door)
- Come in.
- Christine!
- Oh.
- Oh.
(both) Christine...
- You two know each other, of course.
- (both) Of course.
How soon will you be ready?
The carriage is waiting.
- I know Monsieur Garron will excuse us.
- Anatole has just asked me to supper too.
No doubt. You won't be long, will you, Christine?
I have an idea. Why can't we three have supper together? It's all ordered, isn't it?
I am not in the habit of taking baritones to supper.
And I do not care to be seen in public with the police.
Christine, you'll have to make up your mind finally between us.
Precisely.
(Vercheres)
Don't push, monsieur! Oh, no, no.
- Excuse... Mademoiselle...
- Excuse me.
Don't push, monsieur, please!
Will you join me for a bit of supper at the Café de L'Opéra?
With pleasure, monsieur.
Think we can get through this crowd?
Certainly. After all, who'd pay any attention to a baritone and a detective?
Quite right.
- After you, monsieur.
- After you,  monsieur.
Our illustrious leader, the presidente, has brought law and order to Cuba.
This law and order, under which Cuba has become a land of progress... must be preserved boldly.
There are factions in Cuba which are dangerous to our people.
They must not be allowed to flourish.
We must protect the people of Cuba from their disturbing influences.
Strong measures are needed, and we are strong.
I move, therefore, that the Senate of Cuba... vote immediately on the bill before it.
The bill that makes the assembling of more than four people... in any open public place... not only illegal, but an act of treason against the government.
Only by the enactment and vigorous defense of such a law... can Cuba achieve its destiny.
Second the motion!
The motion has been put that the Senate vote on the bill... making all public gatherings of more than four citizens of Cuba... a violation of the public welfare.
All those in favor will please rise.
The bill making public assemblage an act of treason against the government... has been passed unanimously.
What is all about it? What's it say here?
I am reading now:
"Long live freedom in Cuba.
"Cubans, our rights have been stolen.
We live in fear.
"The tyrants are strong, but the cry of liberty is stronger.
"Cubans, raise your..."
You're under arrest. Come on.
- I have done nothing.
- Let him alone!
Come on!
It's no good. Go on. Save yourselves.
Manolo.
What is it, Manolo? What has happened?
You were out with them again.
Why, Manolo, why tonight?
- Can't it wait?
- No. It can't wait.
It can never wait, China.
That is something I learned.
- There is so much at stake for you.
- I didn't forget the examination's tomorrow.
I didn't forget the way you, Mama, and Lolita have worked for tomorrow.
Still I could not do otherwise.
I couldn't go to them and tell them:
"No, I'm sorry. Cuba will have to wait until I have finished my education."
But it was only a matter of one day.
It's always a matter of one day or one week or one year.
There are always excuses.
I've heard them all from others:
"Yes, I would join you, but I'm married.
"I believe in what you're doing, but I have a family."
That's why there are so few of us.
What happened, Manolo?
What happened tonight?
There were three of us.
We were distributing leaflets.
The police spotted us. They chased us.
- The one who was driving got shot.
- They killed him?
He was still alive when we left him.
I hope he's dead now.
Don't look at me as if I'd gone crazy.
He's in the hands of the porra.
I hope he died quickly, for his sake and for mine.
If he's alive they will make him tell who was with him.
You must get away, Manolo. You must hide.
- The examinations are tomorrow.
- What does that matter?
- Your life is at stake.
- But suppose my friend is dead by now?
Suppose he was lucky enough to die?
Then I will be running away from shadows.
We must keep our heads, China.
If my friend is alive, he won't talk at once.
We have a rule in the organization that a man who is caught must hold out... for at least six hours, to give his comrades a chance to escape.
After that, he is free to die easy.
Then if they come after you... it would be around 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning.
That's right.
Now listen, China. I know a place I can go.
If the porra are not here by 8:00, at the latest... you will know that everything is all right.
In that case... walk up the east side of the street opposite the university at 9:00 tomorrow morning.
I'll be waiting. If you don't come,
I'll know they're after me.
What will you do then?
Havana will hide me.
She takes care of her own.
See you soon.
Nobody came to the house.
I waited up all night.
It was just like every other night.
The policia passed every three hours.
Our neighbor, Señor Gandara, came home at 2:30 in the morning.
He was drunk.
His wife was very angry with him.
She almost woke up the whole neighborhood, telling him so.
At 5:00 the vegetable trucks passed on their way to the market.
Do you remember everything that happened?
Everything.
It was the longest night of my life.
- But it ended well.
- Yes. It ended well.
Let us thank God for that.
Thank you, Chinita.
- Good luck.
- I don't need it anymore.
- You are China, his sister, aren't you?
- Yes.
I was with your brother in the car.
Forgive me for not standing with you at the grave.
I was afraid to show myself.
They are after me, too.
Who are these murderers?
They have a hundred faces and one name: the porra.
They're everywhere, listening, finding out who is against the President.
And big or little, it makes no difference, they are silenced.
I saw the man who killed Manolo.
I saw his face.
I will never forget it.
I am going to get a gun and I will wait for him outside their headquarters.
- They will kill you.
- I expect that.
- I will gladly give my life in exchange.
- It won't only be your life.
They'll arrest your whole family.
They'll punish your friends.
I know that your heart is filled with hate.
But you must try to understand that vengeance is no good.
What else can I do?
There's a great deal you can do.
If you're willing to risk your life.
If you want to serve a real purpose, join us.
- How do I go about this?
- I will tell my superior... and he will communicate with those higher up in the movement.
They will notify you where and when they want to see you.
- Very well.
- You will hear from us.
- Señorita Valdez?
- Yes, señor.
I was expecting you.
This is Mr. Fenner.
- How do you do?
- Won't you sit down?
Hello.
Lovely night. Deceptively so.
Even the Morro is beautiful in this moonlight.
Scores of our friends have been imprisoned there.
They caught a shark yesterday, here in the harbor... and in his belly they found the arm of one of our best men.
His family identified it by a seal ring on the hand.
Always the best ones are lost, or so it seems.
Manolo was one of the best.
- You are his sister, aren't you?
- Yes.
May I express my sympathy.
- I want to take his place.
- That's what I've been told.
Joining the organization is a very serious step.
Getting out alive is much more difficult than getting in.
I know that.
Very well. We do not repeat an oath because there is none binding enough.
We only swear in our hearts to make Cuba free.
You work for the Metropolitan Bank, is that correct?
I have been there for two years.
Fine. Then you can be of immediate service to us.
Mr. Fenner is in Cuba to arrange for the booking of Cuban entertainers... into American theaters.
He represents a group of Americans who are convinced... that our music and dancing can gain great popularity in their country.
They are prepared to spend a considerable amount of money... in the purchase of song rights and hiring of artists.
Mr. Fenner has an account at your bank.
Through some oversight, documents which furnish proof... of his business relationships and financial standing... are not in the reference files.
I'm looking to you to remedy that.
That will not be difficult.
They should be stamped with the date of arrival at the bank.
The fifth, seventh and eighth of June.
The fifth, seventh and eighth of June?
How much time do I have?
The sooner it is done, the better.
In case anything unusual comes up... you will get in touch with Mr. Fenner at the Hotel Vista Allegro.
Don't discuss this matter over the phone.
Good night.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Señorita Valdez.
Señor Ricardo Icentia's credit limit... is being raised from 2,500 to 4,500 pesos.
What's the matter with you? You look ill.
Nothing. I'm all right.
Miss Valdez.
Miss Valdez, this is Señor Ariete, from the government.
Would you ask the chief clerk... to bring the folders of all American accounts opened in the last three months?
And would you check with the tellers if anything has come in this morning?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
No new American accounts have been opened this morning, Mr. Seymour.
This one is perfectly all right.
He's a cigar importer with whom I've done business in the past.
This one, Thompson... a joint account of an elderly couple.
I remember this one, too.
Name is Fenner.
He's a chap that's hiring theatrical talent.
The disbursements seem to be mainly for... steamship fares and advance salaries on American contracts.
This is a business account.
Fellow's financing a small fishing fleet.
No, Señor Ariete, it doesn't appear that any of these are what you're after.
Do you keep yourself informed about changes in all the accounts?
- Withdrawals, deposits, and so on?
- Yeah. More or less.
Any happening of an unusual nature... within the accounts will come immediately to your notice?
Of course.
Then you will notify me in case anything of this kind occurs.
Immediately. Is that clear?
I am holding you personally responsible.
Very well, señor.
That's all, Miss Valdez.
And I don't have to remind you,
Mr. Seymour... you're in a foreign country.
Have we not met before, señorita?
I don't believe so.
There is something familiar about your face.
- Indeed?
- I don't think I'm mistaken.
It's not likely I'd forget such a pretty face.
I assure you, we have never met.
Perhaps.
Mr. Tony Fenner, please.
I'm not worried about his coming to the bank.
I'm not worried about his coming to the bank.
I expected them to start checking.
They'd have to be pretty dumb not to guess... that funds are being supplied from the outside.
What's his name again, the porrista?
Armando Ariete.
- And you say you know him?
- He is the man who killed my brother.
He killed him on the steps of the university.
Manolo had been distributing pamphlets.
That is why he killed him.
- Did you see it?
- I saw it.
Does Ariete know who you are?
For him it was just one of many murders.
I am going to ask for permission to kill Ariete.
Will you speak for me to one who is in authority?
He needs killing, the hyena.
Then you will speak for me?
Perhaps.
- Where do you live?
- Opposite the Colon Cemetery.
- How far is that?
- About a mile.
- Do you feel like walking?
- I often walk.
Do you always go home through this place?
Yes. It saves several blocks.
- Where's your house?
- By the west gate.
- Across the street from the cemetery?
- Yes.
How many are there in your family?
There were five of us until Manolo was killed.
There wasn't much room, but we got along all right.
We were all very good friends and we were never hungry.
Manolo must have been your favorite.
We used to sell flowers to the tourists in the streets at night.
You would never guess where we got the flowers.
I might.
It was bad to do, very bad.
But we always said a prayer whenever we took a flower.
Manolo believed that was more than a fair exchange.
The owners never put up an argument, anyway.
Not during the day.
But sometimes at night they would.
I would wake up with a nightmare... and swear by the Virgin that I would never do it again.
But then the next day we would need rice and coffee and beans.
So you'd go across the street and steal a few more flowers?
The politicians always have the biggest funerals... with the most flowers.
Soldiers fire volleys over their graves... and sometimes the President himself makes a speech.
Hundreds of people come, but only a few weep.
That the poor part of the cemetery?
Yes, over there, where the wooden crosses are.
And the little headstones. It is very different.
There are no marble vaults for our dead.
Their coffins are simply put into the ground.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- Has your house got a cellar?
- Yes, it has. It's one of the old houses.
Is it possible to get your family to go away for a few weeks...
- to Matanzas, for instance?
- Go away? Why?
Never mind why. Would they go without asking questions?
- Well, they have not the money.
- The money would be furnished.
- Yes. They would do it if I asked them to.
- I'll let you know in a few days.
In the meantime, forget about killing the porrista.
What's that got to do with my family leaving the house?
Plenty, honey, plenty.
I know how to kill him, all of his friends, including the bloody President.
If only the leaders will give me the go-ahead sign.
I know how every one of those hyenas will die.
The tomb is not the end.
It is merely the way.
Our Cuban tobacco makes the best cigars.
You are all strangers to me and to each other.
But the organization knows each one of you.
On former occasions you have displayed determination and courage.
And that's why you're here.
For we have a special job to do.
One that requires both of these characteristics... and even more than that.
As a rule, we would simply give an order which you would be expected to obey.
But because of the special nature of this plan... you are going to be given the choice.
If you are willing, fine.
If you refuse, if you decide that you do not want to take part in this thing... you have only to say so and no one will hold it against you.
- Is that clear?
- Si.
This is the man who originated the plan... and under whose leadership it will be carried out.
I'll let him tell you about it.
Suppose it were possible to get the President and his Cabinet... all the heads of the government departments... all the army big shots, the chiefs of police, the porristas... all in one place.
And suppose once you had them there, you could wipe them out.
Kill every one of them with one blow.
Would any of you object to that?
That is what we have been waiting for.
Suppose this would involve the killing of innocent people as well.
- How many innocent people, amigo?
- 20, 30, maybe 100.
The porra kills innocent people everyday.
What are these people doing close to the President... if they are so innocent?
Wives, children, servants.
I have seen children lying dead in the streets of Havana.
It is a crime committed daily by the porristas.
But two wrongs do not make a right, and they never have.
Should we, who are trying to free Cuba, become murderers, too?
You would be willing to give your own life for your country, right?
- Gladly.
- Then I don't agree with your reasoning.
If you're willing to give an innocent life, why not take one?
- My neck is not very important.
- Well?
I am the sister of Manolo Valdez.
Shot by the porra in his 19th year for distributing leaflets.
- I am with you.
- That's one.
And my name is Guillermo Mantilla.
I had two brothers, both younger than myself.
They were in the same federation with me.
And because of this they were killed and their bodies thrown into Havana Bay.
Two.
My name is Ramon Sanchez.
I have not suffered under the evils of the regime any more than the next man... but I know its abuses as well as he.
I agree to take part.
Who would think twice? Of course, I agree.
- What's your name?
- Toto Berenguer.
What about you?
Remember what I said.
You may decide either way.
The willful killing of innocent people revolts me.
But you say it would make Cuba free.
I look at all of you and I know you are good men, friends.
I believe you.
- I will join you.
- Good.
This is the plan.
We're going to make a bomb.
A bomb big and powerful enough to destroy everything within a radius of 100 feet.
We'll put it together at Miss Valdez's house.
And where will this bomb be used?
In the cemetery.
At the funeral of some important hyena... which the President will attend.
And he won't be there alone.
His Cabinet and the rest of his murderous gang will be there.
They'll all be blown to hell, which is where they belong.
We may have to wait for years for a funeral that the President would attend, amigo.
Such important hyenas die very slow.
The funeral will be provided when we need it.
But how?
- That will be taken care of by another unit.
- That's right.
We will only furnish the name of the candidate.
How do you expect to transport a bomb of this size? It will be seen at once.
We're going to dig a tunnel from her house to the family tomb of the candidate.
Whoever he is to be.
Now listen carefully and remember what I tell you.
Do you know where the quarry is, out on the central highway... where they do all the blasting?
- I know it well.
- Good.
We will make several trips between there and the house of Miss Valdez.
Each time we will come back with a package.
If we are caught, the package will mean death for both of us.
Guillermo, tomorrow, at 2:00 in the morning... a truck with a load of iron sewer pipe...
What's that?
Percussion caps.
They were in the basket of fruit.
- How do they work?
- The wires connect here.
The electricity is sent through them.
It explodes the caps... and that causes the dynamite to go off.
- Have they brought the dynamite?
- It's in those earthen jars.
There's enough there to blow this house a mile high.
And there's more coming.
What time is it?
- It's 4:30.
- They should be back by now.
It will be daylight soon.
Don't worry. They made two trips safely.
The third time is the lucky time.
You see, señorita, we say "third time lucky"... because the third time that you drop the bait in... that is the time that you catch the fish.
But who is the fish, Fenner or the police?
It isn't right for the leader to take the greatest risks.
It is by taking the greatest risks that a leader becomes a leader.
Then he cannot get out of the habit.
His planning has been excellent so far.
Everything has gone like clockwork.
Americans are all very efficient.
You have known many Americans?
I spent a week in Miami and I observed them closely.
One and all, they are cool and efficient.
It is easy to be cool and efficient in Miami.
One thing I wonder about, why is he in this?
We have many American sympathizers.
True, but they do not expose themselves as he is doing.
Some men fight injustice wherever it appears.
The country does not matter.
I think he is that kind of a man.
The bridge at Cerro.
That's where they're most likely to have trouble.
There's no telling when the guards will take it into their heads to search a car.
He will make it all right, señorita.
Neither of the other trips took this long.
I usually start getting up at this hour.
What is your job?
I work on the docks. And you?
I'm a mechanic.
- Automobile?
- No. Bicycles.
That's what I thought. You're not like us.
You work with your head.
I'm doing postgraduate work at the university.
You must be rich.
You could sit at home, too, like the American.
When a rich man joins the fight, there you have a man of conscience.
You got everything? How about the wire?
- The wire is in the cellar.
- Good.
Put those things away.
They shouldn't be lying around.
Do you have a flour bin?
And this box, put it in the wash basket.
Cover it with dirty clothes.
We have the makings of a fine cake.
Now where are we going to put it?
This is China's house and this is the road.
For our purposes, the funeral can take place in only one of two parts of the cemetery.
Here or here.
China, you and I will meet to choose the bait.
You'll have to help me.
We must be sure to pick a really important hyena... whose funeral they'll really turn out for.
I'll meet you at the big gate of the cemetery at 9:00.
If we are going to tunnel from the house to this point... we will have to go more than 100 yards.
- It'll take hard work to save Cuba.
- Very hard work, amigo.
Have you ever gotten anything free in life, Guillermo?
A guava.
That's as much as you'll ever get.
- When does the digging start?
- Tonight.
You have today to say your goodbyes to your families, girls and jobs.
- Make the most of it.
- Gracias.
I'm going to walk down to the Malecon and take a last look at the pretty girls.
It's getting light now.
We'd better leave one by one.
- Good hunting.
- See you tonight. 11:00.
Permit me to tell you that as a Cuban...
I am grateful.
He's educated, high class. Real aristocrat.
Now, Toto, he does not say much.
- One hundred percent politico, isn't he?
- He's a politico, all right.
And me off the docks, and Miguel, a mechanic of bicycles.
We're a mixed lot, amigo.
Five mechanics couldn't do the job or five aristocrats... or five dock workers, either.
That is the truth.
Good night, señorita.
- Good night, Tony.
- Good night, chico.
Don't forget, China, meet me at the big gate of the cemetery.
That's Mama, of course.
And Lolita and Consuelo.
And that's Manolo.
And this is you.
Is it because your eyes slant that they call you China?
Everything was for Manolo.
Clothes, so he would be dressed right... his tuition, books.
He was going to be a lawyer, the best in Cuba.
We were all very happy in this house.
It's different now. I'm a stranger here.
Good night, China.
I don't want to stay here.
I'm afraid, Tony. I don't know why.
I don't want to stay in this house.
There's a place on the waterfront that stays open all night.
- Let's have breakfast.
- I will change my dress.
The boat for Miami and points north.
- She looks beautiful.
- She is beautiful.
Clean and white.
And she's leaving Havana... leaving the heat and the crooked streets and the fear and the murder.
That's it.
Turn your back on them, the President and all his fat friends.
Tomorrow you'll be where a man can breathe.
Do you wish you were on board, Tony?
No, I'm glad to be here.
What's the matter, China?
Good morning, Señorita Valdez.
Out early, aren't you?
- Morro crab and coffee.
- Si, señor.
My name is Ariete.
- Mine is Fenner.
- Fenner?
Oh, yes. You are in the theatrical business?
That's right.
- You're here in Cuba looking for talent.
- That's right.
Musicians, singers, dancers.
That's it, isn't it?
I am somewhat of an authority on the nightlife of this city.
Don't hesitate to call on me.
Armando Ariete.
Hospitality to foreigners is part of my job.
They tell me that the Morro crab this year are remarkably big and fat.
- Breakfast?
- No.
Dinner. I put the town to bed every night,
Mr. Fenner.
Then like a good parent, every now and then
I look to see that it is sleeping soundly.
- Waiter! Check.
- Si, señor?
12 pesos. Gracias, señor.
Señorita Valdez.
Don't forget, Mr. Fenner,
I am at your service.
- Call on me any time.
- By all means.
So that's Ariete.
He's still watching us.
Steady, China. Steady.
The Lopez Sirven family.
Rodrigo Lopez Sirven is a big power in the government.
His wife died when their baby was a little more than a year old.
And the child followed his mother in less than seven months.
Lopez nearly went crazy with grief.
Although it was many years ago... the women of his family still come on the saint's day of the mother and the child.
I have seen them often.
They always kiss the statue of the baby before they leave.
Not this one. He's had trouble enough.
The Contreras family.
Vicente Contreras.
He is the head of the Senate.
It's less than 100 yards from here to your house.
Contreras is very popular.
It might be a mistake to choose him.
He is even popular with some in the revolutionary party.
The more popular he is, the better.
Yeah.
This is the one.
Are there any transformers or big dynamos in this neighborhood?
No.
All right. We'll work in four-hour shifts.
Two men will dig while two sleep.
One will always be on lookout.
Sometime after 2:00... a truck will come by to take the earth away.
The men will be in the uniforms of the City Sanitation Department.
When you let them in... don't speak to them, they won't speak to you.
All right, Guillermo, what are we waiting for?
This one is for the President.
For the Vice President!
For the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
It's good to change jobs, that's all.
Was I going too slowly?
Too fast.
Work slow, Ramon. It is wrong to fight it.
A shovel like this can win over the strongest of men.
You say to yourself:
"I'm getting you. I'm wearing you out."
You are wrong.
The shovel is only bright with strength.
You're something of a poet, aren't you?
A poet who cannot write becomes a workman.
A man with a shovel leads two lives.
His mind is seldom on his work.
Most of the time he's dreaming.
No sailor goes on such long voyages.
- You make it sound good to work.
- It is not so bad.
In a week or so, you'll get the hang of it.
Yeah?
Why are you in this? You, an American.
Guillermo says you have dedicated yourself to fighting injustice.
Is that why you came to Cuba?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
I'll tell you.
I heard that rum was cheap, and the girls were pretty... and it was summer all year around.
Go to bed. Get some sleep.
I can't sleep.
Well, try.
In nineteen hundred and thirty-three,
Tony Fenner said to me
Get your shovel and your pick
We'll strike a blow for liberty
What is wrong and what is right
Will be decided with dynamite
That is what he said to me
We'll dig all day, we'll dig all night
Chinita is so beautiful
Chinita is so very good
Five men adore our sweet Chinita
As 75 men would and should
Seventy-five men would or should
- 28 bags.
- Only 28?
No, 30. You don't know how to count.
All right, 30. I made a mistake.
I bet you that we will fill more than 40.
- Ramon?
- At least 40.
What about it? 10 pesos.
It's a bet.
You want to take part of it, Miguel?
- No. I do not.
- You see, he knows we'll win.
No, it is not that.
It's just that I do not believe in betting on things that have to do with killing.
Forget the bet, Guillermo. Come on.
A nice evening for the beach, don't you agree?
A nice evening for the beach, don't you agree?
Yes. I suppose so.
A few of us are going out to Las Fritas.
If you come there will be an even number of fellows and girls.
Who is the odd one?
Señor Munoz, the first teller.
Will you tell Señor Munoz that I'm in despair at having another engagement?
You cannot cancel it?
No. I am sorry. Perhaps some other time.
- It's a pity.
- Good night.
Good afternoon, señorita.
What is the matter? I do not see you about the cafés lately? It is disappointing.
I have not been well.
And your friend, is he ill, too?
- My friend?
- Yes. Your friend Mr. Fenner, the American.
I saw Mr. Fenner a few days ago.
He said that he was going into the country to listen to the Guajiro music.
He is sending many Cuban entertainers back to America, you know.
I suppose if he has disappeared...
I shall have to take you around the cabarets myself some night.
Mr. Fenner has by no means disappeared.
I might stop by for you anyway.
I'm sure there are things in Havana you have not seen.
I have seen enough in my time.
- Good rum.
- Compana.
- Made in Havana.
The year the President came to power.
Then this is just the right bottle.
Yes. For that we should drink a toast to him.
To the President, a man who has lived seven years too long.
Eight years.
The first year, amigo, he was not so bad.
I won't argue with you about a year.
Drink to the day of his death.
I would rather drink to the bomb.
- To the bomb.
- And our bait: Vicente Contreras.
A long happy life, till we need you, Vicente.
Yes. Be careful, Vicente.
Nothing must happen to you until we finish our tunnel.
Don't go out at night without a coat, Señor Contreras.
- Be careful crossing the Prado.
- Please don't go swimming.
Take very good care of yourself.
Shut your mouths, all of you! Shut up!
What's the matter with him?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Contreras, I know him, that's all.
He is a friend of my family.
Then it was a bad joke.
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
A friend of his family's.
I don't know why I said all that.
It is wrong to joke about the death of another man.
Even your enemy.
There is a taxi stopping in front of the house.
It's China.
What's the matter?
A man followed me in the street. I had to take a bus and a taxi to get rid of him.
Maybe he liked your legs.
No. He was not that kind. When I came out of the bank, I ran into Ariete.
He was in his car. This other man was leaning against the building.
When I left he started to follow me.
- What did Ariete want?
- He asked why he had not seen you.
What did you tell him?
I said that you were out in the country, listening to the Guajiro music.
Did he believe you?
- I don't know.
- Probably not.
He had you followed because he thought you were going to meet me.
He suspects something, I guess.
Suppose the porrista comes and we have to kill him? What then, Tony?
The jig will be up.
We'd have to make a run for it.
We will have trouble getting out of the country.
That is why I think we should make plans for an escape.
People who come under suspicion of the porrista leave the country.
But it takes planning.
We should make contact with the rum-running boats... that are smuggling people to Miami.
- We are not making any plans for an escape.
- Why not?
Because every new person we get into this is an added risk.
We must count on the plan being a success to save our lives.
But there is a chance that even if we succeed with the bomb... public opinion will turn against us.
It is possible we will be called murderers.
The people may be shocked beyond their powers of judgment.
A few days ago, Miguel, you refused to bet about the digging because you said... that it was immoral to gamble on something that had to do with killing.
I say not to gamble on the judgment of the people.
That is even more immoral.
Running away, that would be shameful.
We have no right to do what we are doing... unless we're prepared to answer with our lives.
What's the matter with you?
You look as though you were covered with blood.
It's only the red clay.
- China, what's wrong?
- Nothing.
Why, you're trembling.
- I had a bad dream.
- That's not surprising.
Ariete and I were alone on the steps of the Contreras tomb.
It was night.
He was holding me in his arms... and I was telling him everything, the plan from beginning to end.
He kept caressing me with his hands.
I tried to make him stop, but he wouldn't.
He didn't seem to understand the importance of what I was saying.
He was holding me so tightly
I couldn't breathe.
And then suddenly the cemetery was crowded with people.
Their mouths were open.
They were screaming, only it sounded like singing.
They grabbed Ariete.
Someone brought a rope.
Then they hung him from the lamppost and set fire to his body.
- It was awful.
- Why was it awful?
You want that hyena to die, don't you?
But Ariete's being alive meant that we had failed.
That the bomb hadn't gone off and all this was for nothing.
We will not fail! Don't think it.
- Even in your dreams, don't think it.
- Tony.
We've struck rock.
A ledge of rock.
It's hard, like the wall of the Morro.
Where is Tony?
In the cellar with Guillermo.
They are setting the charges.
So he is going to dynamite?
As soon as it gets dark.
The traffic is heaviest then.
He thinks there's a fair chance that the explosion won't be heard.
If it is heard, people will only say,
"What was that?" and think no more of it.
Is it not better to work a few more days, try to dig around the rock... than risk everything by blasting?
A few more days, yes. But it might take longer than that. It might take months.
We have wasted 20 hours already.
The trucks have come back empty for the third time.
The police will be swarming over this neighborhood like ants.
Perhaps.
He's willing to risk it, after all the work we have done?
There is nothing sure about a plan of this kind, amigo. It is all risk.
Well, amigos, everything's ready.
The charges are set.
In a half hour, when it's dark, you'll all leave the house.
- I'm asking you to...
- I'll set the charges off and follow you.
If the police come, we'll just keep walking.
There's a man in front of the house.
He's passed twice.
China, come here.
You ever seen him before?
That's the man who followed me on the Prado.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
There's no telling what this means.
We'd better get down in the cellar.
Get the food out of sight.
Straighten the beds.
There's a car stopping.
It's Ariete!
Remember, if you need any help, we could kill that swine.
It'll be better than nothing.
Good evening, señorita. May I come in?
I warned you...
I might pay you a little visit.
Enrique.
See, I do not come empty-handed.
A small tribute.
Flowers that smell are better than these.
- Where are your people?
- At the movies.
Do not lie to me, please.
If they are at the movies, it is at the theater at Matanzas.
Rum, Morro crab, fruit.
Perhaps you would prefer going out somewhere?
No. It's cooler here.
I don't drink.
I approve of that.
It is bad to see young girls drinking.
They are in every café now, wherever one goes.
It is bad for the country.
I am happy to see you're not like the others.
- What do you see in this man Fenner?
- What do I see in him?
Yes. I don't understand it.
A girl like you should not go around so much with an American.
I don't approve of it.
We know what they're like, what they're here for.
When I see them in the cafés, looking at our girls... joking with each other in their loud voices...
I feel the dollars they bring into our country aren't worth the insults.
They are not all like that.
You are mistaken. They are all the same.
This man Fenner is no better than the others.
I have only spent one evening with Mr. Fenner.
But a very long evening. All night.
It was morning when I saw you.
Is it not peculiar to have dinner, breakfast with a man you have just met?
- We went to the jai alai...
- It was Monday night.
There is no jai alai on Monday night.
Then it must have been another evening.
- But you say you have only seen him once?
- Once or twice.
Three times, perhaps.
- Eat.
- I am not hungry.
Have you ever heard of an American who has taken his life... because of unhappiness in love?
It has never been.
For money they jump off their skyscrapers every day, but not for feelings.
They are incapable of a large sentiment.
Rum runs right through me.
I know you think it's strange for me to talk this way to you.
Me, a policeman.
I frighten you.
I can see it in your eyes right now.
I am not frightened, señor.
You are lying to me again.
It's the same everywhere I go.
My closest friends are frightened when I call on them.
People who have nothing to hide, if such people exist.
We all have something we wish to keep hidden, even the best of us.
Perhaps that is good.
Otherwise, there would be less need for men of my profession.
I will tell you something.
Last month I went to Pinar del Rio... to the village where I was born.
I went to visit my mother.
When I drove through the village, the streets became empty.
People I had known as a child hid in their houses.
My mother, in the hut where I was born, looked at me with fear... until I told her why I had come.
Then she cried.
I asked her why and she had no reason.
It pained me.
It is not good to meet that look in your own mother's eyes.
And then I thought, why should it not be so.
If she were an enemy of el presidente, I would make no exception of the old woman.
Still, the truth is...
I am a man of sentiment.
You do not believe it? It is so.
I am easily moved.
A beautiful sunset will bring tears to my eyes.
I like to feed the pigeons in the old Cathedral square.
Must I drink alone, señorita?
I have told you, I do not drink.
You can make an exception tonight.
But you yourself said you do not approve.
That is right.
I do not approve of girls drinking with strangers.
But in my case, it is different.
A man like Fenner might take advantage of your drinking. But I am different.
I am a man of honor.
I am sure of it. Still, I would rather not.
But it would please me.
It would show me that you trust me.
Here, have a little sip.
I knew I had seen you before.
When I was a child, there was a card with a picture on it.
It was your picture on that holy card.
Please do not go away from me.
I am only a little drunk.
Rum does not hurt a man like me.
Do you know what that is, a real man?
It is someone who's afraid of nothing.
I am afraid of nothing. I will show you.
A game of the brave.
The wheel turns.
If the double zero comes up, tell my friends it was for love.
I have killed. I have taken men's lives.
Life means nothing to me.
Please, if you must take a man, take me.
I'll protect you.
Come, señor. Come on.
Tony, the thunder!
Now we can blast. It's safe.
Go ahead.
It's over. Forget him, China, dearest.
Everything's going to be all right.
Will it, Tony?
Will anything ever be right again?
- Yes, it will.
- When, Tony? How soon?
Tomorrow, when it comes.
The big tomorrow.
Tell me, Tony, about tomorrow.
There isn't much to tell.
We won't ask for more than anybody else.
We'll get married. We'll have kids. We'll live in a free country and we'll be happy.
Will we, Tony?
Yes.
Shut up!
Maybe you'd better leave the house.
Stay away tonight.
Why?
We've come to the poor part of the cemetery.
Now it's going to be a nightmare.
The stench of death is like nothing else.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to dig, too.
- Are you crazy?
- Perhaps.
I don't know what sanity is anymore.
- You can't go down there.
- I'm going to dig, too. You can't stop me.
- Is it my turn to dig?
- No, Ramon.
- Tell me when it's my turn.
- You won't dig tonight.
- Vicente Contreras.
- What about him?
I know him. At least I used to know him.
His son Tomas and I were boyhood friends.
I went often to his house.
Is there a doctor in the organization?
Bringing a doctor in is too big a risk.
It's a beautiful old house, with fine paintings on the walls.
His two sisters, maiden ladies, live there with him.
They wore long black dresses with high collars.
Tomas and I used to play in the garden below his father's study.
When Señor Contreras was at work in his study... his sisters used to caution us about making too much noise.
One time, he overheard them telling us to be quiet.
He leaned out the window and he said:
"It's all right. They don't bother me.
Let them make all the noise they want to.
"Children are supposed to be noisy."
Those are not the words of a wicked man.
Señor Contreras is weak, perhaps, but he is not wicked.
I don't say his life should be spared.
As head of the Senate he stands responsible for its actions.
He should have disavowed the Senate and resigned. He deserves to die.
Easy, Ramon.
But not as much as the others.
I am happy that we have nothing to do with that part of the plan.
What of Tomas? What of him, my friend?
He will never understand why his father had to die.
"For what reason?" he will ask.
"Why did you kill him?
"He loved you like a son, Ramon."
- What will my answer be?
- Quiet, Ramon.
They will hear him in the street, Tony.
We'd better take him downstairs where he won't be heard.
I don't say that he shouldn't die.
Only that it must be done quietly.
You are not to make any noise when you kill him. Do you understand?
He is here, Toto. The fat one.
- Do you see him?
- I can see him now.
People who have not seen him think he stands upright and is made of clean bones.
You want to kill me. Go ahead. Try it.
I know that you can't because I am dead.
He is fat and foul. His flesh runs.
You've got to do something about Ramon.
Get him out of here. Kill him. Anything!
I can't stand it any longer.
Something's got to be done about Ramon.
He's right, Toto.
Something's got to be done.
I'm going to tell Fenner. It's up to him.
We'll all go crazy.
What can be done?
He can't be moved from here.
He'd give the plan away in his ravings.
- I know a way.
- What is it?
Others who are innocent are going to die.
- Could you do it?
- Do what?
Kill Ramon?
We've got to do something.
We're all going crazy.
If you want to kill Ramon, go ahead.
Nobody's stopping you. Go on, kill him!
Señorita. Please, señor, you must listen to me.
Señor, please. I have something to tell you.
It's very important.
I must tell you.
Señor, I have something to...
Please, you must listen to me.
Señor, please, listen to me.
Señor, you must listen to me.
They're going to kill Tomas' father in the cemetery.
There's no other way. He must die.
- You're drunk.
- No. I truly am not. Believe me.
I've been often in his house.
He's not a wicked man. Only weak.
- Get away from me!
- Please, listen. It's very important.
Go on, leave me alone!
- I can't go back there. I can't take part in it.
- Let go of me!
Ramon!
Well, why did you come back without him?
You've got to keep looking for him till you find him.
- What's the matter?
- He's dead.
If it was anyone's fault, it was mine.
How did it happen?
We were bringing him back, Guillermo and I.
He was walking between us.
He seemed to be calmer.
He spoke quite sensibly.
Then suddenly he broke away from us and ran across the street.
There was a truck.
We did not even stay to identify him, Tony.
We left him there like a mongrel dog, dead in the road.
He knew he was risking his life when he joined us.
Yes, of course he knew.
And he was willing to die. But for a reason.
Not like that, for nothing.
- Chinita, get a hold of yourself.
- I can't.
I've had enough. I want to run away, Tony.
I want to leave this house, Cuba.
I want to live.
I don't care about anything else.
Take me away from here, Tony.
I can't do that, Chinita, as much as I want to.
Why can't you?
Why are you so strict with yourself?
Because I started this. It was my idea.
Sure, the people may rise up... and do the job themselves tomorrow or in a year.
We can't depend on that.
We can't pull out now.
But the others are willing.
They're sick of it, too.
I can see it in their faces.
Maybe they are, right now.
But they'd feel different in a few days.
They'd see all the things that made them join us unchanged.
The President in his palace.
The fear in the streets.
Every one of them would know they had a chance to get rid of all that.
You'd feel it, too.
More than any of the others, you'd feel it.
I know you're right, Tony.
Even as I was talking,
I knew that it was hopeless.
Miss Valdez.
Sit down.
When was the last time
Mr. Anthony L. Fenner was in this bank?
To my knowledge, he has not been here in over two weeks.
Do you know about his connection with the revolutionary party?
Certainly not.
Is this man Fenner your lover?
I'm sorry, Miss Valdez.
There's nothing I can do.
This is a government matter.
- Answer the question.
- He is not my lover.
- What is he to you then?
- He is an acquaintance. A friend, perhaps.
What do you know about him, about his personal life?
Nothing. He has told me very little about himself.
And his business?
I know only that he is here looking for talent.
I have not been interested enough to pry into his affairs.
You're lying.
You know as well as I that Fenner is the agent of a group of terrorists... operating against our government from Miami and New York.
He has been paid to come down here to murder and cause unrest.
I cannot believe that.
It is not important what you believe.
What I am telling you are facts.
Fenner is not an American.
His name is Antonio Luis Ferrer and he was born right here in Havana.
He may own an American passport, but he's a Cuban.
He will be tried by our courts and our laws.
And he will be shot as a traitor by a Cuban firing squad.
Perhaps the rifles will be American, but that is all.
Where is he? Where is this criminal?
- I tell you I have not seen him.
- That's a lie!
You're shielding him because he is your lover.
- Señor...
- I will ask for your help when I need it.
Until then, I advise you not to interfere.
I am tired playing games with you,
Señorita Valdez.
I have wasted too much time already.
You will either talk or we will make you.
I had forgotten.
You are a man of sentiment, of honor.
You do not know what fear is.
You are brave enough to attack any woman.
Get up!
What you need is a touch of the whip, a heavy touch! Get up!
Now listen to me.
I will say this once and not again.
I know if Fenner is in Havana... he will communicate with you or he will come to see you.
When he does, you will say nothing to him.
You will simply call this number.
If you choose to disobey these orders you will answer with your life.
Get back to work, all of you, or you will find yourselves in the Morro!
I'm sorry, Miss Valdez. I couldn't help.
I'm a foreigner here.
It does not matter. He didn't hurt me.
China?
- Yes?
- Chinita, get up.
- What is the matter?
- Nothing.
Come with me.
- My turn to dig?
- No.
I think we're all finished with the digging.
- What's that, Tony?
- It looks like we hit the Contreras tomb.
- This is not a joke, is it, Tony?
- No, I'm not joking.
I think we're there.
You go across the street, Guillermo.
Take your hammer and strike it against the south wall of the Contreras tomb.
I just want to make certain. Come on.
The killers of Vicente Contreras
are still at large in Havana.
It is the duty of every citizen
to help the police in their search.
The president will not rest...
until the murderers have paid for this crime
with their lives.
A warning to the citizens of Havana.
Martial law has been declared in this city.
Any unauthorized persons
found in the streets at night...
will be immediately arrested.
A warning to the citizens of Havana.
Withholding information from the police...
as to the whereabouts of the assassins
of Vicente Contreras...
will be punished by death.

It is the duty of every citizen

Good afternoon.
- You're the bomb maker?
- That is right.
You are very lucky I am here.
The last three days I have spent with the porra.
Days and nights without sleep.
Ten questions every minute.
I have not lied so much since my wife went to live with her mother.
You can all help. Stand that up, please.
A few shovelfuls of earth and the dynamite.
- I hope you have kept these dry.
- I think they're all right.
Well, we'll soon see.
Have you heard of the raid at the factory at Luyano yesterday?
The workers put up quite a fight.
Two porristas were killed... and for this, the factory was burned to the ground.
When the workers ran out, they were shot.
- Where are the caps?
- Here.
In Vedado, they shot a 17-year-old girl... only because she opened her window while they were passing.
But their time is coming, you will see.
The day is not far off.
There are those even in the organization who feel... the killing of Contreras was a big mistake.
But I say it brought the porra out into the open.
Everyone knows them now, their names and their faces.
What of the funeral tomorrow?
Do they expect a large crowd?
There will be no funeral in Colon Cemetery.
- Contreras is to be buried at Camguey.
- What?
He is to be buried in Camguey.
- It's a lie.
- What is the matter with you?
- It's a lie.
- What is a lie?
- He's going to be buried here in Havana!
- No, my friend.
Here, I will show you, in the paper, on the front page.
Forget the bomb.
- What?
- Get out.
- All right. If you like. I don't understand.
- Get out.
Good afternoon.
"It has just been learned that the bereaved sisters...
"Luisa and Manuela, have decided to lay their martyred brother to rest...
"in a quiet place in Camguey.
"The Señoritas Contreras, prostrate with grief...
"declare it is their intention never again to return to Havana.
"All over Cuba, flags will be flown at half-mast...
"for the remainder of this week."
All this has been for nothing.
We are not finished yet. Listen to me.
We have the bomb.
We can take it to the palace in a car.
Tony, let me do it.
Please, Tony. I'll take the bomb.
Let me do it.
Shut up.
We've failed. There isn't anything we can do.
Two old ladies change their minds and it's all over, like that.
I'm sorry I ever came back to Cuba.
That is not right, Tony.
A soldier who loses a battle does not curse himself for having gone to war.
Most of them do.
There is no reason why you should blame yourself, Tony.
What happened is something we could not prevent.
Now you must get out of Cuba, if only to protect us.
You're the only one the porristas know about so far. Should they take you...
Don't worry.
I won't be the one to give you away.
But why should we run any risk?
I have a cousin who has a charter boat at Cojimar.
He has saved many of our friends from the porra.
He is less of a patriot than a businessman.
He would want 1,000 pesos, even for me.
These are hard times, amigos.
We could raise the money among us.
- It will take a little while, but...
- He must leave at once.
I will go to the bank and get the money.
You can write a check on your account, Tony.
There will be no one to claim that you did not make a withdrawal yourself.
When can you make the arrangements with your cousin at Cojimar?
- I will go there right away.
- Good.
I will have the money by tomorrow night.
- What about the rest of you?
- We have no choice. We're in this thing.
We couldn't get out if we wanted to.
We'll go on with the fight as best we can.
- Goodbye, Tony.
- Goodbye, Toto.
Why is it when you go to say what you have in your heart... you always feel like a fool?
Tony, there is a small inn next to the pier at Cojimar.
Go there tomorrow morning before it is light.
Ask for Gregorio. He will take you to a room.
- My cousin will meet you there.
- All right.
I came here a month ago.
I did not know anyone.
Five names, that is all.
China, Tony...
Toto, Miguel, and Ramon.
We started working together.
We became friends.
Pretty soon there was nothing outside this place.
It was my whole world, and it seemed as if... we six were the only people alive.
Now it is finished, that world.
We will not see each other again.
Adios, Tony.
The pier at Cojimar, the back door, at night.
That's the way my father left this country
10 years ago. I was just a kid.
I couldn't understand why he took it so hard. He was getting out alive.
I stood next to him on deck.
The old man cried.
I was ashamed to be his son.
It shows you how dumb a kid can be.
But now I know how he felt that night.
That's why I don't want to get on that boat.
- You must, Tony.
- Yeah, sure.
It's the least I can do for you and the others.
Listen to me, Tony.
We have failed, yes, and it is hard to fail.
But it is not a disgrace.
It is only disgraceful not to try.
Before I left the States, I raised $12,000, not for me, but for Cuba.
And it wasn't donated by a bunch of exiled millionaires.
I got it from the people up in Spanish Harlem.
Small-time musicians, rumba dancers, old men who work in cigar factories... waiters, busboys, the people I grew up with.
I took more than they could afford to give.
They were glad, for they thought
I could help get their country back.
I've got to go back and tell them it didn't work.
That I spent their money saving the hide of Tony Fenner.
And that the politicos still own Cuba.
They'll look at me and say to themselves:
"He doesn't look any the worse for wear."
They'll be right.
A man who really fights doesn't return in a clean suit... like a traveling salesman with a briefcase full of orders.
Do you think it would help anyone if you died?
Maybe it would help me.
When you say that you would rather die than face those people, it is pride talking.
The wrong kind of pride.
How you feel does not matter.
Nothing about you matters to Cuba, only the failure itself.
I'm not thinking about Cuba.
I'm thinking about me.
Think about us, Tony.
We have lost much, but not everything.
We are not important, like the country, but we have some importance.
And we are going to prove it, together.
I will meet you at Cojimar tomorrow night and we will begin there.
I shall love you forever, Tony.
Mr. Seymour, something has come up.
- I wonder if I may go home now?
- Yes. That's quite all right, Miss Valdez.
Thank you.
China, Mr. Seymour wants to see you.
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything you ask.
Take this envelope to Cojimar.
It is most urgent.
- Cojimar?
- Yes. The café next to the pier.
- Ask for Gregorio.
- Gregorio.
Give him this. A man's life depends on it.
police Department?
You must realize that being a foreign bank... we cannot become involved in political matters.
Especially one as serious as the search for Mr. Fenner.
This check, written by him and endorsed by you... implicates you directly.
Much as I regret it, your position here must terminate as of today.
I'm sorry, Miss Valdez, but I have no choice.
I understand, Mr. Seymour.
- Goodbye, Miss Valdez. Good luck.
- Goodbye.
I waited for you at Cojimar. What happened?
- Didn't Roberto get there with the money?
- I was waiting for you.
- You didn't think I'd leave without you?
- You should have.
The boat is still there.
It is too late, Tony. They're here.
The teller called Ariete when I cashed your check.
They thought I had the money on me and that I would lead them to you.
And that is what I have done.
Come on.
- Should we give ourselves up?
- Either way we will die.
It is better to die here than in the Morro.
Señorita Valdez, open the door!
Get in the kitchen.
Señorita Valdez, open in the name of the law!
Stay back.
We're running out, Tony.
When I give the word, go down to the cellar.
Get dynamite out of the bomb... and get the fuses.
All the dynamite you can carry.
Yes, Tony.
Now!
Cover the rear.
Short bursts.
Stay close to me, China.
I want to make up for all the years
I didn't know you.
What's that? The bells.
Listen. Why are the bells ringing?
What can it mean?
Live the revolution!
Down with Ariete!
Down with tyrants.
Down with Ariete!
China, we win!
The people win! The revolution wins!
The presidente has run away with the soldiers!
The presidente has run away with the police!
Everyone has run away except the people!
My people!
Viva, my people! Viva Cuba!
Guillermo.
Dear God!
It's bad to die five minutes too soon.
No, Guillermo.
They only think they killed him.
He's out there in the streets.
The people are singing on his breast.
Whenever I hear people singing,
I'll hear your voice.
Whenever I see joy in their faces,
I'll see you.
You'll be in their legs when they dance.
You'll be in their eyes when they give thanks to God.
In nineteen hundred and thirty-three
Tony Fenner died for me
Now I have one brother less
But I have got my liberty
But I have got my liberty
Look, Genevieve. Two men coming.
Let me see.
Oh, will you sell it?
Don't you understand?
Wait.
I'll get my father to buy it.
You sit down.
That's it. You wait.
Just a minute.
Oh, I forgot.
He's gone down to the fields.
Well, then, I'll have to buy it myself.
It doesn't belong to me.
Oh, well, maybe Father won't mind.
Oh, well, I can make you understand.
I have fine things.
You trade with me for that.
One, two, three.
Here, look. Very nice.
Look.
Open it.
Open it.
Very funny. Make you laugh.
Oh, my goodness.
Don't be cross. Don't go. Look.
You trade all this for that?
Oh, good!
I'm being very bad. It isn't mine.
Okay, all right.
Oh, goody! It's all mine!
Jill! Oh, Jill!
Go away! Father's coming.
Hurry! Go away!
Oh, my goodness.
Isn't he sweet?
He's better than a doll.
I can play with him.
He has to have a name.
Joe. I'll call him Joe.
Oh, Jill!
I'll surprise Father.
Be quiet.
Won't Father be surprised?
Jill.
Jill.
Where are you?
What's all this stuff?
What on earth?
Jill. Jill.
Surprise, Father. Aren't you surprised?
Jill, where did that come from?
Oh, that's Joe, Father. Isn't he sweet?
Joe? That's a baby gorilla.
Two men had him.
They didn't speak Swahili.
Really, Jill, you should have more sense.
Are you cross?
Well, for a tired man who just found a gorilla in his bed...
...I think I'm behaving very well.
You cannot have a pet gorilla.
Please let me keep him.
Please. I bought him.
How?
What did you have to buy him with?
Money and beads and toys, and other things.
Other things.
Where's my big flashlight?
Well, that makes him partly yours too, doesn't it?
I don't know what to say to you,
I'm sure.
I have worries enough trying to run this farm.
I'm sorry, but you can't keep him.
I will not raise a gorilla.
How the little fella loves his milk.
Does he always take his nap to music?
Oh, yes. This is his favorite song.
- What's the name of it?
- Don't you remember?
It's "Beautiful Dreamer."
Very appropriate.
I think he's grown already, don't you?
Oh, he'll grow, all right.
That's just the trouble.
But, Father, now I have someone to play with.
I know, dear. You're lonely sometimes.
If your mother had lived...
Baby, please try to realize that the time will come...
...when we can't keep Joe any longer.
This will always be his home, and we'll always be friends.
Listen, Jill, when he grows up, he'll be dangerous.
I know that seems impossible to you now...
...but that helpless little baby will be 10 times stronger...
...than any man in the world.
He'll weigh 7, 800 pounds.
He'll be a huge, fierce, dangerous gorilla.
Get me somebody that knows what I want.
Find me an electrician with ideas.
No, no. No, no.
I tell you, it isn't big enough.
Look, I'm branching out into new territory.
I'm building a nightclub in Hollywood.
It's got to be something original.
It's gotta knock them dead.
Take them back to the architect.
Bring me new sketches.
- What about my steamship tickets?
- Mr. Fletcher's here.
Tell Fletcher to wait.
Tell them all to wait.
I gotta shake up my press agent.
I got a letter of introduction,
Mr. O'Hara.
- What do you want?
- I thought maybe...
Well, I'd sure like to go to Africa.
So what? There you are.
Where you been, asleep?
- This is a letter of introduction.
- Half a column on page 20.
- That's good for the Times.
- This is from Tex Wood.
- Two paragraphs on the theatrical page.
- Best I could do.
I want front page!
You gotta get in there and pitch, Windy.
- These guys don't even believe I'm going.
- Can you blame them? I don't believe it.
Max O'Hara going to Africa to bring them back alive.
For what?
Why, there are 50 good animal acts...
...just begging for work right here in town.
Can't I get any cooperation?
Hey, you. What do you think?
Don't you think I ought to go to Africa?
- Why, sure.
- There. There you are. There's a smart guy.
- He agrees with you. He must be.
- This is from Tex Wood.
I don't see why you can't get front-page space, Windy.
We need a new angle.
That's what we need, a new angle.
Hello? What do you wanna talk to him about?
Oh, you wanna go to Africa.
No. No. No...
Say, who are you anyway?
That's a letter from Tex Wood.
Sure. He puts on the shows over at the Garden.
Yes, sir. Madison Square Garden.
Our show closed there last week.
- The rodeo?
- Yes, sir.
- You a cowboy?
- Yes, sir.
- Texas?
- No, sir. Oklahoma.
We rope and ride there too, you know.
I'm Gregg Johnson, champion roper.
All right. Well, what do you want here?
I saw in the paper how
Mr. O'Hara's going to Africa.
Now, there's a place
I've always wanted to see.
You reckon there's any chance he'd take me with him?
Oh, for the love of Mike. Why would he?
We're opening a nightclub, not a Wild West show.
But ain't there something I could do?
If I could just go, I might...
I got it! Hey, what's the matter with you?
What do I pay you for?
- I get all the ideas around here.
- Now what?
Got a new angle. Just thought of it.
It's great. I'll take cowboys.
- Cowboys? What for?
- To lasso lions, of course.
Maxie, you can buy all the lions you want in California.
But I'm gonna send you stories from Africa.
They'll fight to get them.
All you gotta do is pass them out.
Don't you understand? I'm gonna be in terrible danger in darkest Africa.
You're late for the dentist.
Who's the greatest press agent, you or me?
Don't answer.
Hey, you, come on.
You're gonna lasso lions.
- I am?
- Sure. Come on.
Round up some of your friends to help you.
We'll talk it over while I'm at the dentist's.
Who do you think is gonna get the worst of this, Maxie or Africa?
Hey, Ali, bring water for this lion, will you?
- He's a big one, isn't he?
- He sure is.
Just as full of fight as he was two weeks ago.
After you'd roped him, I thought for a few minutes I'd have to shoot him.
Sure glad you didn't.
That's right, Ali, give all simbas plenty maji. See?
Take the machina away.
Away.
Crawford.
Oh, Crawford!
Crawford, where are..?
Oh, there you are.
Look, I got another story to send.
Where's that telegraph office?
At Mdani, about 50 miles.
Have Gregg ride down, will you?
They don't know the way. I'll send one of the boys after they've eaten.
Let's have a spot of tea. Ahmed.
Tea. I hope this never gets back to Broadway.
I hope I never see another horse.
Well, O'Hara, we'll soon be saying goodbye.
You satisfied with the results of the safari?
Oh, sure. Just like I said, I got a million dollars' worth of publicity.
I hope your nightclub will be a great success.
As you've described it, it'll certainly be unusual.
Unusual? Look, nobody's ever seen anything like what I'm gonna give them.
I gotta get back. The date for the opening of my club is all set.
Just wondering if I've overlooked anything out here to make it bigger.
Well, I've read all the stories you've sent back...
...and I really think you've made the most of everything.
Yes, sir.
I sure made the front pages.
Oh, this is a great story I wrote today:
"How I Escaped From Pygmy Cannibals."
Pygmy cannibals? Did you really?
Was that today?
Yeah. They had me cornered.
I'd lost my gun.
They dropped a net over me from a tree.
I was fighting, struggling, but there was too many of them.
They were all over me like ants.
- How do you think I escaped?
- I have no idea.
Did I ever tell you about the mad elephant...
...that seized me in his trunk and flung me one half mile?
I went back afterwards and measured it.
You're catching on.
Hi, Gregg. How about a spot of tea, old boy, as we say in Africa.
Much obliged. I'm getting where I kind of like the stuff.
It took you six months, but you're kind of getting used to me too.
Well, I'm rapidly reaching a point...
...where nothing can surprise me, if that's what you mean.
What's the matter?
Listen.
Sorry, I must have imagined it.
I guess you thought I was a screwball at first, but my idea worked out.
Most successfully.
It's impossible. We're a hundred miles from that country.
- It is! But how can it..?
- What is it?
Ali, my gun! Big gun!
What's the matter?
- What are they saying?
- Darned if I know.
Ali, stop! Come back!
Gregg, get your men.
Slim! Boys, get your horses!
Lay off. No shooting.
Catch it. Rope it.
Are you crazy?
You can't rope a gorilla!
- Hurry up! He's getting away!
- Give me that gun!
You're crazy.
- Give me that gun!
- Don't shoot him.
Wait! You can't rope a gorilla!
Hey, where's my horse?
Stand still.
Whoa, horsey.
Cut it out, will you?
Don't do that! Don't do that!
Can't you cooperate?
There he is!
Where did he go?
He must be around here somewhere.
Hurry up, boys! Get behind him!
Get your rope ready!
Get another rope on it!
Get behind him!
Get another rope!
Look out!
Get behind him.
Get another rope!
Hey, Gregg, watch out!
Hey, Charlie, help!
No!
Hey, come here and help me!
Go on, get out there!
Get a rope on him!
Come here! Help me! Come on!
Where is he?
Don't let him get away!
Where did he go?
Help!
Help! Help!
Joe! Joe!
Help! Help!
Don't shoot! Joe, drop.
Drop it! Don't hurt him.
Don't do that.
Put him down!
Joe, drop it. Drop it, I said.
Help! Help!
- Drop it, I said!
- Help!
Joe, drop it.
What are you doing?
Why, my friend, he was getting killed.
Well, Joe is my friend, and you leave him alone.
Joe wouldn't hurt anybody.
He wouldn't if you treat him right.
Who are you, anyway?
What do you mean by this?
Well, your friend, he came into our camp.
Your camp? If it's within five miles of here, it's on my land.
This is all my property, and you keep off of it, you big bullies.
Come on, Joe.
Come on, I said.
All right, Joe.
Come on, Joe, leave them alone.
Mind me. Come along.
Joe! Come on, Joe, leave them alone.
We're going home.
Am I dreaming or did I see a gorilla and a beautiful dame?
Where did she go? Find out where she lives. I gotta talk to her.
Howdy.
Well, I reckon you're right, but I just wanna see the young lady.
I just wanna talk to the young lady.
I just wanna talk to the lady.
Afternoon, ma'am.
Seems like you always come just in time.
- What do you want?
- I'm Gregg Johnson.
I come to apologize.
With a gun?
Well, I kind of feel safer.
You were gonna shoot Joe.
But, ma'am, he had Mr. O'Hara.
If you hadn't come along, he...
- Oh, I was so frightened. Joe would've...
- He sure would.
If you'd let him alone, there wouldn't have been any trouble.
- We didn't know he belonged to anybody.
- He doesn't belong to anybody.
He lives here. Goodbye.
Wait, ma'am. Mr. O'Hara, the boss, he wants to talk to you.
- He sent me to ask you if it's all right.
- He's afraid?
Well, you can't blame him much.
Please don't be mad at us.
Well, I'm sorry, but you see,
Joe's the only friend I have.
Excuse me for asking, but where's your folks?
I haven't any.
You live here and run this place alone?
It's not so hard.
The servants and field hands all worked for my father for years.
He died six months ago.
I'm sorry.
It's a right pretty place.
I reckon this is my kind of country.
- But don't you ever get lonesome?
- Sometimes.
No, it's my home.
I've lived here all my life.
- It's beautiful. I love it. I...
- Hey, Gregg.
Tell your friends they can come out.
They don't need to be afraid.
How do you do, miss.
That gorilla around here?
Oh, don't worry.
I won't let him hurt you.
- I'm Max O'Hara. This is Mr. Crawford.
- My name's Jill Young.
Pleased to meet you, and I do mean pleased. Gregg told you we apologize?
And I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Don't mention it. Just a little misunderstanding all around.
Everything's jake now, huh?
Have I got plans for you, young lady.
Just wait till you hear.
I'll tell you all about it.
Let's sit down.
Well, come in, but no guns.
- No guns?
- No guns.
Don't you see what a great chance this is for you, honey?
Hollywood.
You must have heard of Hollywood.
- Yes, I've heard of it.
- That's where I'll open my nightclub.
I wanna make you a star.
You'll be the talk of the town.
Everybody'll be crazy about you.
You'll get beautiful clothes, have your hair fixed up. You'll be a knockout.
But I can't sing or dance or...
Who cares about that? All I want you to do is walk out on the stage.
You and Joe. Don't worry about a thing.
I got a contract here, all expenses paid.
With options, of course.
Oh, think of it, honey:
Music, glamour, bright lights, Hollywood.
You'll love it. Come on, honey, sign.
Excuse me for butting in, Mr. O'Hara.
I guess you'll be sore at me.
But, ma'am, you've got an awful pretty place right here.
Maybe you won't like it back there.
Hey, you keep out of this.
Of course she'll like it. Why not?
It sounds wonderful. I've never been anywhere. I'd love to travel.
And go to parties, have beautiful clothes.
You'll meet famous people.
You'll be famous.
Oh, quit rushing her.
Yes, you don't even give her time to think.
Say, what are you guys trying to do, stab me in the back?
That's gratitude, queering my deal.
I'm a square shooter.
I never went back on a contract in my life.
She don't even need a contract.
You take me for a cheap crook?
Think I rob widows and orphans?
I never did anybody dirt in my life.
Never in my life.
- Everybody knows that.
- O'Hara!
Why, my word's as good as my bond.
- Look out!
- Joe, stop!
Put it down, Joe.
Put that rock down.
Be quiet.
It's all right. Friends.
Joe, put that down, I tell you.
Mind me, this minute. Stop it.
Aren't you afraid of Joe?
I sure am, but I don't want him to know it.
I think perhaps you could make friends with him.
It's all right, Joe. Now, calm down.
Behave yourself. Now, listen.
That's a good boy.
Look, Joe, banana.
Will you be a good boy if I give it to you?
A banana, Joe.
Want another one? Here.
Go on, now. Go away.
Oh, boy, what an act.
I gotta sign her up.
Oh, honey, you're wonderful. Sign it.
Go on, honey, please sign it.
It's the chance of your lifetime.
What are you waiting for?
You don't wanna waste your life up in the woods like this.
Let me show you what the real world is like.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Daniels.
- Upstairs.
- And I thought you knew...
...every headwaiter in town.
- Some joint, huh?
- I'll say.
Gee, it looks just like Africa.
That's a good one.
What do you know about it?
Never even been out of the state.
Hey, I sure hope that's a thick piece of glass.
Sure it is, lady.
O'Hara had that made special.
That'll hold anything.
- Let's have a drink.
- You like to try our new cocktail?
- It's called the King of Beasts.
- He doesn't need it.
Shut up, sugar, or I'll throw you to the lions.
Lions are just darling.
I simply love them.
- You know what lions love, don't you?
- No.
Sweet little girls like you.
Oh, Micky, stop.
What do you suppose lions think about?
A drink. Maybe they're thirsty.
Poor kitty. Have a drink.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Who's Mr. Joseph Young?
How would I know?
That's Mr. O'Hara's big secret.
- Maxie's sure got a new angle.
- Yeah, but he never ran a zoo before.
He says these are the biggest lions in the world.
Sure, they would be. Leave it to Max.
- What do you suppose this set him back?
- Boy, suppose it's a flop.
Come on, drink up and go look at the show.
- Maxie, give. Who is Mr. Joseph Young?
- Give us the dope so we can turn in stories.
Yeah, we got deadlines.
Who is Mr. Joseph Young?
- You'll find out. Go on out front.
- Right this way, gentlemen.
The big show is just commencing.
- What's all the mystery?
- Tell us what it's all about.
Yeah, then we won't have to look at it.
- I'm warning you, this better be good.
- It will be. I'll join you in just a minute.
Holy smoke.
Max, I'm sick of keeping my lip buttoned.
This isn't the way we used to put over a show.
Windy, you are looking at the new Max O'Hara.
Dignified, restrained, artistic.
Classy. Go on out front.
You might learn something.
Dignified. Restrained. Artistic.
The shy type.
Hiya, Windy.
All right, Mr. O'Hara, it's about time.
All set back there? Jill ready?
How's Joe acting?
- Just fine.
- Good thing Joe likes you.
He sure does. I can handle him darn near as well as she can.
Your attention, please.
The one and only Max O'Hara.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...welcome to the Golden Safari.
I know you have all read of my exciting adventures in darkest Africa.
But I have never given out the story of the most wonderful experience of all.
That was the moment when I first met, face to face...
...the gentleman I am about to introduce to you.
But first you must meet his lifelong friend.
It is my privilege to introduce this charming young lady.
It is she alone who can completely control the amazing power...
...of the personage whose name appears in lights outside.
If you please.
This tune is an especial favorite of Mr. Joseph Young.
For the love of Mike, what's this supposed to be?
- Has Max gone nuts?
- Give it a chance, fellas. Give it a chance.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Joseph Young of Africa.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I thank you for your applause.
Here you see 10 men.
I have combed the country to find these men.
Let me introduce them.
First, Sammy Stein.
"Killer" Karl Davis.
Rasputin, the Mad Russian.
"Bomber" Kulky.
- "Slamming" Sammy Menacker.
- That's my boy!
- Max, the Iron Man.
- Wow, what a man!
- "Wee" Willie Davis.
- Look, he's got fur!
"Man Mountain" Dean.
The Swedish Angel.
The former heavyweight champion of the world...
...Primo Carnera.
Just look at them.
Every one a champion.
Look at those brawny arms, those massive chests.
I ask you, is there one creature in all the world...
...powerful enough to overcome that combination?
That is the question to which we seek an answer.
That is the test we are about to make.
When I give the signal, the fearless little lady...
...will bring my friend,
Mr. Joseph Young...
- My friend...
- Joe, stop it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.
Here, Joe, take it.
Now, boys, pull it.
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull.
Pull, Joe, pull. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull!
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe.
Pull harder, Joe. Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull!
Pull, Joe.
Joe, what are you doing?
Pick it up.
Pull, Joe.
Pull.
Help! Help! Let me go!
Help!
Let me down!
Let me down!
Go on, fella, get in.
Poor old boy.
Sorry I have to lock you up.
Well, Joe, I don't like it any more than you do.
But I reckon that's the way it's gonna be.
- Hello, where are you going?
- Jill's tired. I'm taking her to the hotel.
Jill, honey, everything turned out like I promised, huh?
- You're on top of the world.
- How..?
How long do you think you'll want us?
Don't you worry about that.
Your contract's good.
You and Joe will be working for me from now on.
Take good care of my little star, huh?
Well...
...that sounds like a long time, doesn't it?
Yeah, it sure does.
How big is he? How big is he?
How big is he?
Give me your autograph.
- That girl from Africa.
- The one with the gorilla?
Hey, how about a pass to the show?
Miss Young, my name is...
I'd like to get a pass to the show.
Go on, eat your dinner.
Lost your appetite, haven't you?
Guess I have too.
Poor old Joe. I don't blame you.
- Hello. Been mobbed again?
- Yes.
Mr. O'Hara said he'd make you famous.
- How's Joe today?
- He won't eat.
I was so stupid. I never realized he'd have to live in a cage.
Too bad.
Guess he's just too big for them.
My poor Joe, he's so unhappy.
That sign outside...
...I know just how he feels.
Ten weeks. It seems like 10 years.
Please don't cry, Jill.
Come on upstairs to O'Hara's office.
We've had enough of this.
Hello, children, come on in.
Well, we sure struck gold in California.
Business is great.
What can I do for you?
Jill's quitting.
Mr. O'Hara, Joe and I are going home to Africa.
- Are you crazy?
- Max, you talk too much.
- Now she wants more dough.
- No, it's got nothing to do with money.
- I want to take Joe back home.
- But you can't. You signed a contract.
You know that contract's no good.
She's underage.
- Hey, maybe you put her up to this.
- You keep out of this, Windy.
Look, honey, you can't do this to me.
You're throwing away good money.
You're breaking my heart.
I'm a square guy.
I told you I'd make you a star, that you'd have beautiful clothes.
You're famous.
You're all dressed up.
- I kept my promise, didn't I?
- Mr. O'Hara, I'm sorry.
I don't wanna seem ungrateful.
You've been very kind.
You think all this is wonderful.
I thought it was going to be too.
But Joe can't live in a cage, and...
...neither can I.
- Oh, honey, talk sense.
It is sense. We're not going to kill Joe.
Well, all right, if that's the way you feel, but...
But you'll give me a little time.
I mean, I've got to get another act to take your place.
I've got to protect my investment.
You wouldn't just walk out on me.
Why, of course, I...
I want to do whatever is right.
Sure you do. Now, I'm gonna take you out and buy you a swell lunch.
Just to show you there's no hard feelings.
I knew you wouldn't let old Maxie down.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Just don't rush me...
...and everything's gonna turn out all right.
You want to go,
I wouldn't try to talk you out of it.
I'd be the last person in the world that would ever...
- What's that?
- Big money for the big monkey.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...when the music starts again, start throwing your money.
One table has a lucky number.
If Mr. Joseph Young picks it up...
...it means free champagne. Ready?
Pick it up.
Pick it up, Joe.
Your cap, Joe. Take off your cap, Joe.
Stop! Stop!
Curtain.
- Who got the lucky number?
- The monkey never even picked it up.
It's a gyp. O'Hara stopped the act so he wouldn't have to give away a drink.
Cigars? Cigarettes?
Hi, babe. Sit down, join the party.
No, thank you, sir. Cigars? Cigarettes?
- Come on, sit down.
- I can't do that, sir. Cigarettes?
But, look, you've ruined my...
- Say, I'll have to pay for these.
- Shut up. Get out.
- Go on, scram. Get out.
- Run along, kid. It's okay.
Listen, you guys...
...cut out the rough stuff or I'll throw you to the lions.
Kid's cigarettes will be on your check.
Enjoy yourselves, gentlemen.
- Who does he think he is?
- Insulting us.
- This joint's dead. Let's get out of here.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I got a great idea. Wait a minute.
- I wanna have some fun.
Let's buy a drink for the big monkey, huh?
- Where's O'Hara?
- Don't worry about him, he's gone.
Come on, everybody bring a bottle.
That's a great idea.
That grouch O'Hara, let's show him we can have some fun.
Poor old monkey.
Bet O'Hara never bought him a drink.
Come on, follow me.
- You better eat something.
- I can't.
How could I let Mr. O'Hara talk me into doing that new act tonight?
He's a fast talker.
Think of me letting Joe stand up there...
...and be a target, a clown...
...for all those awful people.
I'll never do it again.
You bet you won't.
That's too dangerous.
There, you see?
I told you I could find him.
Look at him, very sad.
- He isn't having any fun.
- He needs a drink.
Make him feel good, like us.
Come on, fella. Won't you..?
Won't you join us, Mr. Young?
It's good for you. Forget your troubles.
Come on, that's a sport.
This is good stuff.
Watch me.
Good. See?
Now you take it.
Come on. Don't you wanna feel good?
Try it. It'll grow hair on your chest.
That's a boy. Come on, that's it.
- You think he'll like it?
- Of course he'll like it. Just what he needs.
Come on, try it.
He doesn't know what to do with it.
Hey, chum, watch me.
He caught on. Look at that, he drinks like a gentleman.
- Look at him pour it down.
- He likes it, all right.
Here's looking at you, Mr. Joseph Young.
- Wants more.
- Why don't you give it to him.
- I gave him mine.
- Okay, big boy.
- We're showing him a good time.
- Sure. We're good sports.
And Mr. Young's a good sport.
That's right, Mr. Young.
- Look at that, two bottles.
- Can you imagine the size of his hangover?
Oh, brother.
What a headache he's gonna have.
I'd like to see O'Hara throw him out.
Please stop worrying.
I won't let O'Hara talk you out of it.
Just to make sure that he doesn't, I'll stand on the pier until your ship is out of sight.
That's wonderful.
I wish I could make Joe understand we're really going home.
But aren't you coming too?
But if you don't, that would spoil everything.
You're always saying what a wonderful place my farm is.
You mean you don't want to go back.
Listen, Jill, you can't go around asking guys to go to Africa with you.
I don't. I'm asking you.
Well, of course I wanna go any place you go...
...but I didn't figure you felt like that. Do you?
Of course I do.
Great day in the morning.
Excuse, please.
Jumping catfish, what a thirst.
- Don't you wish you could do that?
- He's just a hog.
He doesn't leave any for us.
That's gratitude.
I'll bet you he could drink up all the liquor in this joint.
Well, I'm not gonna buy him any more.
He's drunk. Disgusting.
Listen, Mr. Young, if you can't handle your liquor, you shouldn't drink.
You drank all our good liquor, you big moocher.
- You ought to be ashamed.
- What, again?
- No, lay off, will you?
- You drank it all.
I'll teach you.
Drink all our liquor, will you?
He'll get out!
- Look out!
- Help! Help!
He's out! He's out!
Look out! Look out!
Help!
Get out of the way!
Please, don't rush! Please don't panic.
Take it easy, will you? Don't run.
Take it easy, folks.
Help!
Help! Help!
- What's happened?
- Joe's loose. He's gone crazy.
- Help me get in.
- Come on.
That ape tried to kill me.
Hear that? Police.
- They'll shoot Joe.
- Keep them out. Give me just a minute.
Joe! Joe!
Stop it!
Stop it, Joe!
Stop that, Joe. Come on.
Come on, Joe.
Please get up, Joe.
All right, break it up! Break it up!
Wait a minute, boys.
Take it easy, will you, fellas?
- Out of the way!
- Wait a minute.
Hurry, Joe.
Shooting the lions!
Joe.
Oh, no.
Your Honor...
...I’m not unsympathetic to Miss Young.
But in view of the destruction and panic already caused by this dangerous animal...
...I cannot allow sentiment to influence me.
Again, I submit that the court order should be carried out.
I'm very sorry, Miss Young, but he must be shot.
He'll never break out again, lady.
Them new bars will hold anything.
Joe...
There isn't anything I can do, Joe.
I tried.
They wouldn't listen.
Gregg and I were gonna take you back home.
It was nice back there at home, wasn't it?
Nobody hated us.
Nobody wanted to kill...
Now, lady, you don't wanna act like that.
You don't wanna be down here when they come to shoot him.
Look, you go and find O'Hara and the young fella.
They're likely upstairs in the office.
Go on, now.
That's a good girl.
Well, it's after 8:00.
Where's Schultz and his court order?
- I don't like this job much.
- It's just like shooting a mad dog.
Well, let's get it done.
I got a date tonight.
Chin up, kid.
Max has a scheme.
I don't know what, but we're not licked yet.
- But where did they go?
- I don't know.
But you can count on Max.
Those men are coming.
They'll shoot Joe.
- We've got a plan, Jill.
- We'll get Joe out.
- Get him out of the state?
- Out of the country.
- Joe's going back to Africa.
- You mean it?
Listen, honey.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
If Joe gets shot, it's my fault.
You and Joe don't belong here.
I talked you into this.
It's up to me to get you out.
I'll get you back home if I have to go to jail for it.
We paid the captain of a freighter down at the harbor.
He promised us not to sail till 6:00 in the morning.
How will we get Joe out?
There's police there.
I've got a plan.
It will take split-second timing.
We've all gotta work together.
Now, listen...
Hello, Moran.
Just came down to take my last look at poor old Joe.
Okay by me.
Just keep that girl out of here.
They'll be here to shoot him in a minute.
Too bad.
I got a lot of money tied up in you.
Goodbye, Joe.
I should have left you in Africa, where you belong.
The old heart. Help me.
Help.
Upstairs. My office.
Easy, now. Easy, now.
You'll be all right.
My office.
- My medicine.
- Take it easy, I've got you.
Good evening, O'Hara.
What's the matter, Moran?
- Why aren't you guarding the ape?
- He took sick. I had to help him.
- My heart. Sit down.
- No thanks.
- Here's the court order. We'll do the job.
- No, don't go. Wait.
- I got a date.
- I haven't read the court order.
Nothing wrong with it.
- You coming?
- No, my heart. The strain.
- Come on.
- Let's go this way. It's shorter.
This won't take long.
Getting kind of careless, aren't you, Moran?
Hey, he's gone!
Hurry, Joe, get in.
Hey, you, stop!
They got into a white van.
Get to a phone! O'Hara's office.
Schultz wants you up in my office.
Right in here.
O'Hara!
Police headquarters.
Operator. Police headquarters.
Operator, wake up! Wake up!
Schultz, here's a tip-off.
A map of Las Vegas.
- They're getting out of state.
- Here I am.
- O'Hara said you wanted me.
- O'Hara?
Operator. Oper...
- I'll get that guy! Get to a phone.
- Get to a phone.
O'Hara ought to catch up along here somewhere. Watch out for him.
Hey, take a look at this.
Get to a phone.
Turn in a general alarm.
Hold it. I hope the kids made it.
I'll take a look.
Here they come.
So long, Windy. Be seeing you.
- Step on it, Gregg.
- I gotta get some air in that front tire.
Give us some air in the left front.
Got a slow leak.
- You want I should change your wheel?
- No, I'm in a hurry.
Yeah, in a big white van, probably heading for Las Vegas.
Calling all cars. Escaped gorilla in large white van headed north.
Animal very dangerous. Shoot on sight.
Fine, it worked.
They think we're headed north.
- What happened? What was that?
- I don't know, but Joe's all right.
- Okay, Schultz, we go north, huh?
- Those roads are well covered.
That map may be one of O'Hara's tricks.
We go south.
- What you got?
- One for the tank, sarge...
...and has he got the horrors.
Running up and down the road, yelling like a banshee.
Take him back.
I'll book him when he's sober.
Now, hold on. That's my old man's lingo.
Get me headquarters.
Captain O'Toole?
This is Obrinski.
Yeah, we just got a report on the gorilla.
This is the real thing.
Calling all cars. Escaped gorilla reported at service station...
... Duane and Tilford.
Hey, that's not far from here.
Repeat. Escaped gorilla reported at service station, Duane and Tilford.
They got us spotted.
They know we're headed south.
What will we do?
Look out!
What do you think you're doing?
Wanna get us all killed?
- Who you yelling at?
- Get off of the road.
You asked for it.
- I'll move the truck.
- Jill, get Joe out.
- What's the idea?
- How much gas has he got?
Oh, I get it. Half a tank.
- Help Jill.
- Right.
- Hey, you seen a big white van?
- Sure did.
- There's something funny about it.
- Going south?
- Yeah.
- That's it.
Hurry, Joe. Hurry!
Get in, Joe. Get in.
Take that road.
It's the back way to the harbor.
I'll see you at the ship.
I hope so.
There it is.
- O'Hara. What are you doing here?
- Was I going too fast?
Come out of there. You thought you'd put one over on me, didn't you?
This is a great indignity.
I demand an explanation.
- Shut up. Open those doors.
- Wait! What are you going to do?
- Shoot that gorilla.
- It's empty.
- Don't open it.
- Get out!
Don't open it. You'll be sorry.
You'll be sorry. You'll get hurt.
Ready, boys? Open the door.
Hey, where's my truck?
Somebody stole my truck.
You smart aleck.
You got the gorilla in a truck.
- What you talking about?
- Where are they?
- Not your business.
- Come!
- Want him too?
- For what?
O'Hara, you're obstructing justice.
Where's that gorilla?
You better start talking, O'Hara.
- I think I'm gonna have a heart attack.
- Fine, have it in there.
Turn around. Back to that crossroad.
That's where they went.
I wonder how long Mr. O'Hara can hold them.
I don't know, but we better get off this road.
I wonder where that fool thinks he's going.
Hang on!
Get out, Joe.
Come on, Joe, push!
Like this, Joe. Push!
- A truck just went down there.
- That must be it.
Push, Joe! Push!
Here they come.
There's the gorilla. Shoot!
Get in, Joe!
- No, you'll hit the girl!
- Get the tires!
- Come on, you, push!
- I will not.
Go in.
Two more. Two more children upstairs.
Jill!
Jill!
Children, where are you?
Jill!
Gregg!
Gregg!
Get to the roof.
Joe!
Joe!
Joe! Joe!
Joe, in here.
Joe!
Gregg!
Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
Look!
Go back, Joe. Go up.
There's a baby up there, Joe.
Go up, Joe. Joe, go up.
My poor Joe.
It's all right, kid. There's nobody in the world gonna shoot Joe now.
No, no, no. It isn't big enough.
Max O'Hara, I didn't know you were back in New York.
Read the paper.
I've been back for months.
Hi, Max. I got 200 girls for you to look at.
They'll be at the pool tomorrow, 10:00.
- They all gotta swim like fish.
- Sure.
It'll be the greatest water show.
Singers, dancers, jugglers, acrobats...
...all in the water.
- I can get you a great act.
- It could work on a raft.
- What?
- Monkeys.
- Nix. Cut it out, will you? See you later.
- Hey, what is this?
- I got a big surprise for you, Maxie.
What is it? Hurry it up.
I got a million things to do.
You've got time for this.
Wait till you see it.
Hey.
Look at that.
The kids told me to spring it on you.
Crawford took it.
He went up there to visit them.
Hi, Jill.
Hello, Max.
Hey, they said, "Hello, Max."
And they lived happily ever after.
I sure hope so.
They will. They're back home where they belong.
NARRATOR:
Vigilant, tireless, implacable.
The most silent service
of the United States in peace or war...
...is the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.
The Bureau went to war with Germany
long before hostilities began.
No word or picture
could then make public...
... the crucial war service of the FBI.
But now it can be told.
In 1939, with thousands
of known and suspected enemy agents...
...invading the Americas...
... the FBI started building up its force
of special agents and employees...
...from 2000 to a war peak of 1 5,000.
Before being sent into the field,
each new agent had to learn...
...all the modern techniques
of crime detection...
...such as the use of a specially treated
x-ray mirror...
... through which an FBI man
can see without being seen.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation
had to be the world's...
...most efficient intelligence
and counterespionage service.
For war is thought,
and thought is information.
And he who knows most
strikes hardest.
By examining the intercepted mail
of unsuspecting Nazi agents...
... the FBI uncovered many
secret channels of communication.
Between the lines
of an innocent-appearing letter...
...invisibly coded
in an obsolete German shorthand...
... were important instructions
for one group of spies.
The Bureau's infinitely
painstaking system...
...of sifting and recording every scrap
of potential information...
...paid handsome dividends.
The FBI was adding new names
to its long list of Germans...
...known to be dangerous.
And each day, as fresh investigated
reports came in from the field...
...FBI officials saw more clearly...
... the pattern of German espionage
in the United States.
Nucleus of the Nazi network
in America...
... was the German Embassy
in Washington...
...protected, until a declaration of war,
by diplomatic immunity.
Long before December 7th, 194 1,
from a vantage point nearby...
... G-men photographed the actions
of hundreds of suspects.
These are the actual films
taken by the FBI.
They gave Director Hoover
and his men a daily record...
...and description
of all embassy visitors.
This continuous
photographic surveillance...
...provided a permanent record
to be studied intensively...
... whenever new developments
took place.
The Bureau soon discovered
that the embassy was being used...
... to disperse money for subversive
activity in the United States.
The Bureau also knew that the embassy
had a short-wave radio...
...and was in direct communication
with Germany.
No one was watched more closely
by the FBI...
... than the arrogant
Baron Ulrich von Gienanth.
Although accredited
as an embassy official...
...he was actually chief
of the German Gestapo in America.
Equally important were pompous
Vice Admiral Witthoeft-Emden...
...and his suave assistant,
Helmut Raeuber...
...experts in obtaining information
about ships and cargoes.
Dr. Hans Thomsen,
the German chargé d'affaires...
... tried to win American collaborators.
So did his associate,
General Karl Boetischer.
Parading before hidden FBI cameras
were the embassy secretaries.
These girls spent evenings
in the company of American servicemen.
They were having fun...
...but they were also diligently
accumulating information for Germany.
The FBI watched them discreetly,
knew all about them.
By relentless surveillance
of embassy officials...
...and all those
with whom they associated...
... the FBI learned that Germany
was recruiting American Nazis...
...for its espionage service.
In 1939, Nazi fronts, like Fritz Kuhn...
...and his German-American Bund,
were flourishing.
The Germans said
they were only social gatherings.
But the FBI knew that these societies
were part of a well-laid German plan...
... to build up a fifth column
in the United States.
In 1939, on the campus
of a Midwestern university...
...not far from Columbus, Ohio,
there was a brilliant young student.
Born of German-American parents
who were proud of his college record...
...he was preparing
to become a diesel engineer.
His name was William Dietrich.
Just before graduation...
...Dietrich was approached
by German representatives...
... who offered him a free trip to Germany
and a well-paying job on arrival.
Dietrich reported the incident
to the FBI.
When the meaning of the German
invitation was explained to him...
...Dietrich offered his services
to the Bureau.
With money generously supplied
by the Germans...
...Dietrich bought passage at the German
Tourist Bureau in New York City.
The Germans felt that Dietrich
was an extremely valuable man.
So did the FBI.
Ten days later Dietrich was 3500 miles
from New York...
...in Germany's great port city
of Hamburg.
On the Klopstockstrasse
was a second-rate hotel...
... the Pension Klopstock, which housed
the German High Command's...
...notorious school for spies.
Here were trained hundreds
of recruits for the Abwehr...
... Germany's super-secret espionage
and sabotage service.
Like Dietrich,
many of his classmates...
...had been recruited
in the United States.
And back to the United States
they would go...
... when they were properly equipped.
NARRATOR: Synthesis of the FBI's
counterespionage offensive...
...in World War II
is the Christopher case...
... which opened, as great cases
often do, by accident.
A little accident
at Bowling Green in New York City.
MAN:
Hey, look out!
[TlRES SCREECHlNG ]
[PEOPLE SHOUTlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY]
[MOANlNG ]
Christopher, Christopher.
[SlREN WAlLlNG ]
Might as well take it easy, Joe.
He's through.
NARRATOR: Somewhere in the
dark web of war was Christopher...
... the dead man 's companion...
... the man who had retrieved
his friend's briefcase and vanished. lNTERNE: Who was he?
ATTENDANT: He's got a Spanish passport. Francisco Ruiez.
Hey, doc, look at this. lt's all in German.
Stuff about ships, l think.
Yes.
[READlNG lN GERMAN]
That means, uh. . . .
That means incendiary bullet.
''Weight 1 48 grains. Load 46 grains.
Dupont 1 1 -27 powder. ''
Can you read Spanish too? lNTERNE:
Something funny about this.
We better get his fingerprints and turn them over to the FBl.
Fingerprint him.
NARRATOR: To the desk of
FBI Inspector George A. Briggs...
...came the report
on the death of Francisco Ruiez.
In the FBI Identification Division...
...are nearly 1 00 million sets
of fingerprints...
...so organized that it takes
less than five minutes...
... to identify a set of fingerprints
with those on file.
No fingerprints were listed
under the name of Francisco Ruiez.
But regardless of name,
once his print was classified...
...a search for the individual's identity
was a simple matter.
TECHNlClAN:
There's something coming now.
Yeah, it's in cipher.
This stuff is fugitive.
We better get a shot of it before it dissolves.
BRlGGS: Set.
TECHNlClAN: Okay.
-Send a copy to Cryptanalysis.
-Yes, sir.
-ls this what you're looking for?
-l'll see. lt certainly is. Thanks a lot, Quinn.
Here it is, Mr. Briggs.
Oh, thank you.
[READlNG lN GERMAN]
[READlNG lN GERMAN]
That translates, ''Mr. Christopher will concentrate on Process 97. ''
-What's that?
-Well, Herr Christof. . .
. . .Mr. Christopher will concentrate on Process 97.
-That's all?
-That's all.
Thanks. Thank you.
NARRATOR:
Inspector Briggs knew...
... that the most important American
military secret in history was Process 97.
Set up a conference with Military and Naval intelligence immediately.
That's all.
NARRATOR: In several remote places
under strict military protection...
...American scientists
were developing Process 97...
... the secret ingredient
of the atomic bomb.
An explosive derived from the metal
uranium so powerful and devastating...
... that one relatively small bomb
gave promise...
...of having the destructive power
of 20,000 tons of TNT.
[BLASTS]
A presidential directive gave the FBI
the responsibility of coordinating...
...all counterespionage investigations.
At a series of conference with Army
and Naval Intelligence officers...
... the FBI reviewed the case
of Francisco Ruiez...
...from whose effects had come
the startling information...
... that foreign agents
had learned about Process 97...
...and were actually attempting
to steal the secret.
Plans were formulated to erect
an impenetrable and absolute barrier.
Have you any other information,
Mr. Briggs?
No, not at this time.
-Mr. Briggs.
-Yes, admiral?
Who is this Mr. Christopher? l wish we knew.
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, after
six months of intensive training...
...Dietrich had completed his course
at the Pension Klopstock...
...and was ready for assignment.
For your first needs, $50,000.
You will make three contacts only:
Elsa Gebhardt, Colonel Hammersohn, and Adolph Kline.
-You will keep them in funds.
-Yes, sir.
When you reach New York, go directly to Elsa Gebhardt on East 92nd Street.
You will establish contact with Hammersohn and Kline through her.
-Yes, sir.
-These are your credentials.
They are on microfilm.
You will need these: draft card, registration, classification card. . .
. . .birth certificate, driver's license,
New York State. . .
. . .Navy and Army discharge papers,
Social Security card.
No one could tell them from the originals.
One thing more:
There is one person in the United States. . .
. . .who can countermand the orders l have given you. lf you receive instructions from Mr. Christopher. . .
. . .abandon whatever you may be doing. . .
. . .and place yourself entirely at his disposal.
-Mr. Christopher?
-ls all of this clear?
Yes, sir.
-Goodbye, colonel.
-Goodbye.
NARRATOR: Within a few days,
Dietrich was in Lisbon, Portugal...
...communication center
for international espionage.
He went immediately to an address
given to him by the FBI.
There's something wrong with this watch. l wonder if you'd look at it.
-l'll have to examine it.
-Would you, please? l'm sorry, sir, l won't be able to repair this watch. l understand. Thanks.
NARRATOR:
Thirty-two hours later...
...a special courier coming by
transatlantic clipper...
...brought Dietrich 's credentials
to FBI headquarters in Washington.
Inspector Briggs was given
the responsibility...
...of solving the Christopher case.
Behind him
were all the resources of the FBI.
That translates: ''William Dietrich is specifically authorized. . .
. . .to receive all reports for transmission direct. Two. . . . ''
[READlNG lN GERMAN]
That means, ''You're instructed to look to him for all payments. Three. . . . ''
[READlNG lN GERMAN]
That'd mean, ''He is forbidden to have any contact with agents known to you. ''
Change that last line.
Change it to read:
''He is authorized to contact all agents known to you. ''
Right.
[STEAM WHlSTLE BLOWlNG ]
-ls that a new watch?
-Yeah.
Did it cost more than $ 1 00? l don't remember exactly.
Do you mind if l take a look at it?
Certainly.
There you are.
What's the value of this watch?
-Oh, it's about $90.
-Thank you.
-Here's your watch.
-Oh, thanks.
You can get out that way.
NARRATOR: Just off Madison
Avenue in uptown New York...
... there was a five-story dwelling.
This was soon to become known
among all FBI men...
...as the house on 92nd Street.
May l help you?
-Miss Elsa Gebhardt?
-Yes. l'm Bill Dietrich. l have a message for you from Felix.
How is Felix?
You mean Felix Braun of Miami, of course. l mean Felix Strassen of Hamburg.
He asked me to pay his respects. . .
. . .to give you these.
-Would you care to sit down?
-Thank you.
The new one has arrived. Bill Dietrich. l have his credentials here.
Max, turn off the light.
He's authorized to contact all agents known to you?
-Everything all right?
-You'll want your credentials back.
Yeah. l have brought you some money.
You know what l'm going to do over here? l've been expecting you. l understand you can help me make certain contacts.
Yes, we can start right away.
Would you come with me?
This is Bill Dietrich.
-Where'd you come from?
-Germany.
-Where in Germany?
-Hamburg.
Pension Klopstock, Klopstockstrasse.
Who gave instructions to come to America?
BlLL:
Colonel Strassen.
-How did you get here?
-l came by freighter.
JOHANNA: From Hamburg?
-No, from Lisbon, Portugal.
-When did you leave Lisbon?
-Three weeks ago.
-How long did you stay there?
-Two days. l waited for the freighter.
-You stayed under cover?
-Yeah, at the Grand Hotel.
-Whom did you contact in Lisbon?
-No one.
You're sure of that? l had strict orders not to contact anybody.
When did you get here? l don't see why l have to answer all these questions.
-Didn't you show them my credentials?
-Yeah, we seen them.
Maybe he doesn't want to tell us when he got here.
JOHANNA: ls that right, Mr. Dietrich?
-l have no authority--
You got off of the boat at 1 0: 1 7 this morning.
You left the pier at 1 0:50.
You took a cab to the Martinique Hotel at 32nd and Broad.
You checked in and stayed there until 1 2:30.
Then you took a bus to 42nd Street and Times Square. . .
. . .and walked to the Silver Dollar at 46th Street and had a cup of java. . .
-. . .then here.
-Why didn't you come right here?
-Why did you go to a hotel?
-Well, l wanted to take a bath and l-- lt looks like you know all about me.
Yeah, we're gonna keep on knowing.
Before you arrived, we worked in small groups, unknown to one another.
BlLL: l see.
-What's so special about you. . .
. . .that you are allowed to know all our agents?
Those are the orders. lt looks like we're all taking a chance on you, mister.
Everybody takes a chance.
Hamburg wants their agents to be in a position to send information direct. . .
. . .through me, in the event of emergencies.
Who are these people?
Max Coburg, Conrad Arnulf.
They used to be with the Eiserne Wacht Bund.
Johanna Schmidt, she has special duties.
Gestapo. l know about you from Hamburg.
What do you know?
Usual things.
What's your job?
They've got to get stuff through faster.
Radio's best, so l'm going to set up a short-wave station.
-l'll need some help.
-What kind of help?
Radio parts, mostly. lt'd look suspicious if l bought them all myself.
What do you want?
Well, l have a list here. l'll let you know where you can send them.
This stuff is hard to get. l know, but Hamburg needs a station here.
Conrad will get them for you.
As soon as l find the right location, l'm going to open up an office.
People with information can contact me there.
Send me word as soon as you are ready to operate. l'll get it to the others. l wanna contact a Colonel Hammersohn.
-l can arrange that.
-l have some money for him.
Well, l wanna get started as quickly as possible.
Certainly.
So that's the guy from Hamburg.
JOHANNA:
What do you think, Elsa?
He has good credentials, but--
How do we know?
They look good, so what?
No. No, l don't trust that guy.
He knows too much.
We won't take any chances. l'll check with Hamburg for confirmation.
-How?
-Hammersohn.
He can get a message through by mail to Brazil.
A courier will take it by ltalian Airlines to Dakar. lt's simple from there.
Max, contact Hammersohn.
-Tell him l want to see him today.
MAX: Yeah.
NARRATOR: Following a prearranged plan
for maintaining contact with Dietrich...
...Inspector Briggs set up a special office
in New York City.
Here's some air-raid literature for you to pass out.
-All right.
-Now l wanna know. . .
. . .who actually lives in that house and what floors they live on.
-Shall we get a layout?
-No, we'll get that later.
Okay, we'll get right up there.
[DOOR BUZZlNG ]
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-ls the superintendent in?
-No, he isn't.
-Can l help you? l'm his wife.
-This is in regard to air-raid precautions.
-Air raid? We are at war?
-No, not yet, ma'am.
We hope we won't be, but if a war should come, we want to be ready.
Yes, of course.
We're making a survey of everyone living on this block.
-What is your name please?
-Kassel, Freda Kassel.
Would you let us know who's in the apartments?
Just Miss Gebhardt.
She rents the whole house.
She has a dress store.
-Gebhardt, your husband and yourself.
-That's right.
-Are you here most of the time?
-Yes.
My husband is a pianist.
He goes all over places. l see. Well, l guess that's all.
Here's some air-raid literature, if you'd like.
-Be particularly careful about lights.
-Yes, sir.
NARRATOR: Just off Columbus
Circle in New York City...
...Bill Dietrich, posing as
a consultant engineer...
...rented an office and established
his place of business.
The office looked legitimate.
He was almost ready
to receive callers.
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
-Morning.
-Good morning. Are you Mr. Dietrich?
That's right. l believe we have a mutual acquaintance, Felix Strassen.
Come in.
Felix Strassen.
Yes, l knew him in Hamburg.
HAMMERSOHN [OVER RADlO] :
I feel sure it must be the same man.
I'm Colonel Hammersohn.
Glad to know you.
Won't you sit down?
Looking for something, colonel? l'm just naturally cautious. l have just moved in.
Things are a little bit upset.
Yes, l see. l have something for you. lt's microfilm from Felix. lt confirms you have funds for me.
And you have something for Hamburg.
We'll see.
BlLL: You must have good sources of information. l've had considerable experience.
-You've heard of me, of course?
-Oh, yes.
During the last war, l worked with Captain Boy-Ed. . .
. . .Fritz von Papen,
Count von Bernstorff.
This time the stakes are higher. . .
. . .the personal danger proportionately greater.
With my record, l'm very careful.
Have you been here long?
Not very long, no.
They supplied you with adequate funds? l can pay for information.
That's in the credentials. lt takes a great deal of money, you know.
We're willing to pay. l think, perhaps Hamburg might be interested. . .
. . .in an entirely new type of gun the United States Army is testing.
-lt's a wonderful gun. l've seen it.
-Hmm? lt projects an anti-tank rocket.
Guiding fins are folded inside the barrel.
Here are complete details of recent shipments of Bell Airacobras. . .
. . .and Curtiss P-40s to England and Russia.
This is special information on the new Lockheed P-38s.
The speed and armament of this plane is strictly secret. . .
. . .or was until l got hold of this. l'll send these to Hamburg.
Terribly difficult information to get, but there it is. l was instructed to give you this. l was told you could put me in touch with a Mr. Adolph Kline.
Adolph Kline?
For shipping information. l have orders to contact him.
-l'll arrange it.
-Good.
-Cigarette?
-Thanks.
How can l get in touch with Christopher?
Why?
Well, he's my boss. l've never even met him.
-He is my boss too.
-Yeah? l haven't met him either.
-You'll take care of me on Kline?
-Oh, yes.
Where will l find him? l'll contact him and arrange a meeting.
When will this be? l'll let you know.
NARRATOR: In a secluded cottage less
than an hour's drive from Manhattan...
...Agent Dietrich set up
a short-wave radio transmitter.
Hamburg complimented Dietrich
on the speed and efficiency...
... with which he got his reports
through to Germany...
...and their instructions
back to the United States.
They did not know...
... that Dietrich 's little short-wave radio
had a limited range...
...and that all his messages
were beamed...
... to a secret FBI long-range radio station
not far away.
From this point, the FBI relayed
Dietrich 's messages to Germany...
...on the wavelength and schedule...
...and in the code
that the Germans had given him.
He received all replies and instructions
from Germany the same way...
... through the counterespionage station
of the FBI.
But all messages in both directions
were first teletyped to Washington...
...for immediate examination.
All messages to Germany were held
before relaying...
...until the Army and Navy
had rendered them harmless...
...or perhaps had skillfully doctored them
to mislead and confuse...
... the German High Command.
NARRATOR:
Besides operating his radio station...
...Dietrich extended his contacts
with the German spy ring.
As their pay-off man,
the enemy's agents had to come to him.
Some tried to sell information
of no importance.
Others brought highly secret data.
The FBI's hidden movie cameras
and microphones...
...recorded all Dietrich 's visitors.
[BUZZlNG ]
[PHONE RlNGlNG ]
-Hello.
NARRATOR: Suddenly and disastrously...
...Japan struck at Pearl Harbor.
On this momentous,
infamous Sunday...
... the FBI sprang into action
just as swiftly and effectively...
...as the rest of the nation 's
armed forces.
Within 24 hours,
all known enemy agents...
...and saboteurs
were taken into custody...
... with a few purposeful exceptions.
Important agents,
like Colonel Hammersohn...
...Elsa Gebhardt, Conrad Arnulf...
...and Johanna Schmidt,
were left at liberty.
This was to justify
the continued liberty of Bill Dietrich.
And because, watched closely...
... they could still help more than harm
the American people.
They still knew or might know things
and people not yet known to the FBI.
Such as Adolph Kline...
...and Mr. Christopher.
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
BlLL: Oh, Colonel Hammersohn.
-Hello, Dietrich. lsn't it sort of dangerous for you to be coming here now?
Yes, the war makes everything difficult.
Every day, they're picking up more of our agents.
But l've made contact with Adolph Kline.
-When could l see him?
-lmmediately. Come with me now.
Good.
-Where are we going?
-l'm not at liberty to say. Come on.
Calling Car 70. Calling Car 70.
AGENT 1 [OVER RADlO] :
Come in, Car 7 0. Over.
Car 70 standing by. Over.
AGENT 1 [ON RADlO] :
Mr. H going down in elevator with D.
Mr. H going down
in elevator with D.
-Follow and advise. Over.
AGENT 2: Okay, will do. Off and clear.
[STEAM WHlSTLE BLOWlNG ]
Here it is.
How will l know Kline?
There'll be someone there to introduce you.
-Aren't you going in with me?
-No, l shan't see you for a long time.
We've got to be very careful from now on.
-Good night.
-Good night.
-Good evening.
-Hello.
Meet Adolph Kline.
How are you?
Glad to know you, Adolph Kline.
From Felix.
-ls that all?
BlLL: Mm-hmm.
Well, it takes money to operate.
You talk, l'll pay.
''The Britannia sails for England tonight.
A Dutch boat, the Delftdyke, goes with her.
She'll join convoy 30 miles due east of Sandy Hook.
Delftdyke carries a cargo of munitions and planes. ''
May l have that?
[HlCCUPS]
-Who is that?
-That's Gus Hausman. He works for me.
He's drunk.
He is a good man for information when he isn't drinking.
-Hello, Gus.
-Shove over, you.
[MUSlC PLAYlNG
ON JUKE BOX]
-Who are these people?
-They're friends of mine.
You're the pay-off man, is that right?
That's right.
He's going to take care of us.
Take care of you.
You know where he gets his dope on ships, don't you? l give it to him, that's where he gets it.
Who's going to take care of me?
-Now, come on, Gus. l'll buy you a drink.
-l had a drink.
How would you like to know the Queen Mary's back again?
She's loading 40,000 drums of oil.
Now would you like to know where she's going?
Australia, that's where she's going.
And she's full of troops.
How much dough is that worth?
-l pay Kline. He'll take care of you.
-Oh, you pay Kline.
-Who pays me?
-l'm going to take care of you, Gus.
You take care of nobody.
You gonna pay off?
You'll have to operate through Kline.
Okay. Okay.
Let's just forget the whole thing. l know where l can get some real dough.
Maybe l'll just spill the inside story on what's going on around here.
Shut up. l don't know who you are, sister. . .
. . .but tell me again when l come to see you. l'll bring you a nail file to cut through the bars.
Look, she knows what she's doing.
-Hey, bud, got a match?
-What?
You got a match?
-You want a light?
-Yeah, bud. How you feeling?
[TRAlN WHlSTLE BLOWlNG ]
[TRAlN WHlSTLE BLOWlNG ]
Four hundred. . .
. . .four-fifty, five-- Five-fifty.
Well, that isn't much money to operate. l gotta pay a lot of people.
You'll be paid well enough.
Have you seen Mr. Christopher lately?
Hey, who are you?
You were told about me.
Don't you trust me?
You're fooling around with stuff that's none of your business.
-l thought it was--
-l gotta be sure. . .
. . .that my information is getting through.
-That's my job.
-Maybe.
But l gotta be sure. l'm gonna send my information through Mr. Christopher.
-l'm working for Christopher.
-What are you asking about him for?
-The war's changed things.
-Only Mr. Christopher can change things.
-Well, if that's the way you want it.
-That's the way it's gonna be.
While you're sticking your nose in things, you might take a little trip with Gus.
-Good night, Kline.
-l don't even know you.
-Where have you been?
-l just came from the office.
Where were you last night?
At the radio station.
Weren't you supposed to meet Kline last night?
Yeah, l met him.
You're to get this to Hamburg as fast as you can make the transmission.
What is it? lf we hadn't done anything else in all the years we have been here. . .
. . .this information would be more than worth it. lt's up to you now.
This is your chance. l'll get it through.
-Cigarette?
-Thank you, l don't smoke.
Could l see them?
You're to have these papers back here tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night?
That's a tough order. l've got to put this in code. lt'll take time.
Orders are not to be questioned. lt'd save time if l can burn them when l was finished.
This information will also be sent by mail tomorrow night.
These orders come from Mr. Christopher.
-Christopher?
-Yes.
They were delivered to me less than an hour ago. l just saw Dietrich leaving.
Did he tell you about Adolph Kline?
No, what about him?
He was picked up last night.
Violation of selective service. FBl.
-Dietrich was with him.
-When he was picked up?
That l don't know.
He didn't tell me. l wonder if he knew.
We've got to be careful about Dietrich.
Have you been able to get through the confirmation copy?
Well, it takes time. With the war on, there are a lot of restrictions. l won't be satisfied until l have it in my hands.
-Have you any reason to suspect him?
-No.
There may be nothing at all to worry about.
But until that confirmation copy comes from Hamburg, he must be watched.
We are doing our most important work right now.
Dietrich is a vital part of that work. lf he fails, we all fail.
-Max.
-Yeah?
Get down to the radio station.
Cover Dietrich and keep him covered.
NARRATOR: Less than an hour
after Dietrich received his instructions...
...from Elsa Gebhardt, an important
envelope reached Inspector Briggs.
The envelope contained the data
Elsa Gebhardt had given him...
... together with an important clue...
... the cigarette butt,
stained with lipstick...
... which Dietrich had found
on Elsa 's desk.
The contents of the envelope
were so unusual...
... that Inspector Briggs rushed
to FBI headquarters in Washington.
And presently,
a distinguished physicist...
...sent for by Briggs,
was flown to Washington.
He was Dr. Arthur C. Appleton...
... 7 2-year-old chief
for the central laboratory...
... where the final secret experiments
on Process 97 were being conducted.
Gentlemen, these papers contain data on Process 97. lt is appallingly accurate.
These are details of experiments which we made barely two days ago.
Dr. Appleton. . .
. . .we must send this information on through to Germany.
Now, would it be possible to change a few details. . .
. . .in order to set their scientists off the track. . .
. . .without arousing the slightest suspicion?
-Of course it is.
-lt would?
We've been thrown hundreds of times ourselves by the slightest error.
Now, we're going to need your help to change that data.
-Do you think you can do it tonight?
-l can start immediately.
NARRATOR: Inspector Briggs
ordered the central laboratory...
...placed under strict
and continuous surveillance.
Through an x-ray mirror in the rear
of an ordinary delivery truck...
...movies were taken...
...of even the most trusted individuals
working on Process 97.
This method of surveillance...
...enabled the 400 FBI agents
now assigned to the case...
... to become familiar with the faces
of every worker...
...permitted to leave the plant.
This facilitated the FBI's difficult job...
...of tracing all of their activities
and all of their contacts.
Let's go over to my office.
NARRATOR: The cigarette which
Dietrich was shrewd enough...
... to take from Elsa Gebhardt's desk
was examined by FBI technicians.
Without a doubt...
... the woman who had delivered
the data from Mr. Christopher...
... was the woman
who had left the cigarette.
It was still the only lead
to her identity.
First, a portion of the stained cigarette
was examined by spectrograph...
... to determine what properties
it contained.
The lipstick could then be identified
by comparison...
... with all known brands
in the Bureau's files.
BRlGGS: That's fine.
Send it along as soon as you can.
Here's the lab report on the lipstick.
NARRATOR: The analysis revealed
a particular brand of lipstick...
...used by 98 different beauty parlors
in New York City.
By checking clients and operators
of these establishments...
...against the records of every known
suspect, the FBI narrowed their search...
... to one particular beauty parlor...
...and one particular suspect:
Luise Vadja.
Well, what was in the envelope to cause so much trouble?
-Don't you know?
-l understood.
Family messages from people in Germany to be smuggled underground. l saw no harm in it.
-Perfectly innocent messages.
-That's all.
Now let's stop this little game and get down to real honest facts. l've told you the facts.
We know a great deal about you,
Miss Vadja.
You once worked on a North German Lloyd liner.
You were a hairdresser.
You used to bring across letters from Germany. . .
. . .and mail them when you got ashore. l never knew what was in them.
They were instructions to German agents in this country.
And you were working as a courier for the German secret service.
Right now, you're what we call a sleeper agent.
You were planted here a long time ago by the Nazis.
You lived a normal, inconspicuous life for years. . .
. . .making friends, earning a living. . .
. . .just waiting until you got a call for the one particular job.
And they saved you for a big one.
But you made one mistake.
You took the trouble of becoming an American citizen.
And that, Miss Vadja, makes you a traitor. l've done nothing since the war began.
Nothing. l swear it.
All right. Now let's get back to this envelope. Where did you take it? l was told to take it to a house on 92nd Street.
-And who told you to take it there?
-l don't know.
Could it have been a name like Mr. Christopher?
-l don't know that name.
-Are you sure?
Yes, l know the name, but l don't know who he is. l've never seen him.
Have you ever delivered messages any other place?
-Just the house and to a bookstore.
-Bookstore. lf something goes wrong, l deliver the messages there.
What bookstore? lt's on 59th Street. l think the name is Lange.
-Aren't you sure?
-Yes, it's Lange's Bookstore.
You have a friend who's a scientist.
He's engaged in very important war work.
-What is his name?
-l have no friend.
Yes, you have, because he visits you at your home.
There is your friend. . .
. . .and there is your home.
And the name of your friend is Charles Ogden Roper.
[CRYlNG ]
[BUZZlNG ]
You can keep this young lady in custody. l want a surveillance made of Lange's Bookshop on 59th Street.
Right. We've been through the Vadja apartment.
-Find anything?
-We found the typewriter and checks.
That's the one that was used to copy the data.
Then Roper is the man who's been getting it out.
-Shall we pick him up?
-No.
We can't pick him up until we find out how he does it.
Here we've got a man under 24-hour surveillance.
He never leaves the laboratory without being thoroughly searched. . .
. . .and still he's getting the stuff out.
That's our problem.
That's what we have to solve.
How does he do it?
How does he do it?
NARRATOR: The following day,
an unusual message from Germany...
... was picked up
by the FBI monitoring station...
...and relayed on to Dietrich.
It was also teletyped to Briggs.
[TELEGRAPH BEEPlNG ]
Hey, you're in the wrong lane!
[WHlSTLE BLOWlNG ]
Stop a black coupe, 51 6 New York, last three numbers. One man driving.
[SlRENS WAlLlNG ]
-Let me see your driver's license.
-l haven't got it with me.
-Well, let's see your registration card.
-l haven't got that either.
Okay, you come down to the station house with me.
We wanna check up on you.
JUDGE:
Have you anything to say? l prefer not to say anything till l talk to my lawyer.
All right. What's your lawyer's name and telephone number?
Rector 2351 5.
Ask for Mr. Briggs.
You received that message from Hamburg today?
-That's right.
-Have you done anything about it?
Well, not yet, Mr. Briggs. l was about to contact you for advice when the message came to meet you.
Oh.
We think that this may be the lead that we've been looking for.
-lt might be.
-What does it mean to you?
[READS lN GERMAN]
That's a familiar word in Hamburg for a very special type of agent.
-Oh?
-lt's the name of a performer. . .
. . .who accomplishes spectacular feats of memory.
-Memory artist.
-Memory artist.
Hamburg's always looking for people with unusual memories.
They take a special course just to improve their memories further.
Yes, but do you think that a man even with a very unusual memory. . .
. . .could get those formulas out?
All that complicated stuff?
Sounds incredible, but that's what they're trained to do.
Sure, it is incredible.
Memory artist.
Photographic mind.
A little bit at a time.
Well, it may be a lead.
Maybe it's a solution.
What will l do about the message?
You just send it through your regular channels.
-Oh, anything new on Christopher?
-No, not yet.
Mm-hmm. Well, l'll arrange for your bail and fine.
Oh, uh, when you give the message to Elsa. . .
. . .why, be very sore at the police, huh?
-Yes, sir.
-Don't overplay it, you know.
NARRATOR: The FBI had to know every
detail of Charles Ogden Roper's life.
JACKSON: Yeah, l remember that crazy act, but l can't remember the name.
Never could remember names.
Does this sound like it:
''Has performed in clubs,
Sunday school entertainments. . .
. . .banquets, special parties.
Demonstrates amazing feats of memory. ''
Oh, don't pay any attention to that.
They always write their own.
''Performs amazing feats of memory. ''
What kind of feats? What's the angle?
Well, you see, people call for things from the audience.
They want to hear stuff out of highbrow books.
You know, this guy can keep 1 4 games of chess going at the same time?
-Chess?
-Boy, there is a lousy game.
But 1 4 games going at the same time would take a remarkable memory.
-Sure, but it ain't box office.
-l'll take this along. You'll get it back.
Don't worry, brother, that act is out of date.
APPLETON: Mr. Roper.
-Yes?
-l'd like to see you in my office.
-Yes, Dr. Appleton.
This is Mr. Briggs of the FBl.
Mr. Roper, my credentials.
Sit down, won't you?
You recognize those?
Those are Photostats of Process 97.
They were stolen from here. l understand you're one of the workers allowed to leave the institute.
ROPER:
A few evenings each week, yes.
And you always spend those evenings with a friend in town.
-We play chess.
BRlGGS: Chess. l never go anywhere else.
She's an old friend of mine. l've known her a long time.
-How long?
-About three years.
Shortly after we intercepted this data,
$5000 was paid into your bank account.
That money was from securities l'd sold.
Doctor, what do you want to know?
This gentleman thinks. . .
. . .that you memorized parts of that formula before you left here.
And when you got to your friend's house, you set them down.
We know all about you, Roper.
We've traced you back to the day you were born.
We even know the approximate date that you're scheduled to die.
You might be interested in this.
That's an intercepted message direct from Germany. lt'll save a lot of trouble all around if you'll cooperate with us.
-What do you want?
-You typed the formula. . .
. . .on a typewriter owned by your friend and gave them to her, didn't you?
-Yes.
-What other contacts have you made? l received several messages at my friend's house.
From a man by the name of Hammersohn?
-l don't remember.
-You don't remember?
A man who can keep 1 4 games of chess going at the same time. . .
. . .and you don't remember?
You've been playing with a very dangerous group of German agents.
We know. We've seen them work.
They don't mind murder.
You were the next one on their list as soon as you finished your job.
Did you ever get a message from a man by the name of Christopher?
-Yes.
-lsn't it possible that Christopher. . .
. . .and Hammersohn are one and the same? l don't know. l've never seen either of them.
Did you deliver Process 97 data to any other place. . .
. . .besides Luise Vadja's apartment?
Yes, after she was arrested. . .
. . .l received instructions to take the data to another address. l made my last delivery this morning.
And where was that?
Lange's Bookshop on 59th Street.
-l put the material in a book.
-What book?
Spencer's First Principles.
What was it you delivered?
What was it, Roper? l gave them the latest data on our final. . . .
On our final experiments.
Thank you, doctor.
Put that man under arrest. l'll call Walker.
Yes, sir.
NARRATOR: For some time, Lange's
Bookshop on busy 59th Street...
... was under constant surveillance.
Every person who entered
or left the store...
... was being photographed
by FBI agents...
...from an office directly
across the street.
LANGE: Can l help you?
-Yes, l believe you can.
LANGE:
Are you looking for a particular book?
Yes, but l can't find it.
LANGE:
Well, what is it?
Have you got a copy of Spencer's First Principles?
Spencer's First Principles?
No, l haven't had a copy of that for some time.
-l might be able to get it for you.
-That's funny.
A friend of mine said he picked up a copy here.
That's very possible, although it must have been some time ago.
No, this morning. l'm afraid your friend made a mistake.
Oh, excuse me, l have a customer. l don't think you're going to have any customers for some time. l'm from the FBl.
We'd like to talk to you at our office.
-Now?
-Right now.
Johanna, we've got to get this through today.
-Where's Bill?
-At his radio station.
Now, you and Conrad take this out there.
Stay there while he puts it into code.
Make sure that he sends it. . .
. . .because everything depends on you getting that through.
-He'll send it.
-Then bring it back here.
Has the confirmation on Bill come?
No, we expect it any time now.
The clipper's been delayed.
-You think we ought to take this chance?
-There's nothing else we can do.
He's still our fastest channel to Hamburg.
-We've got to take a chance.
-Okay, let's go.
[DOORBELL RlNGS]
ELSA:
Where have you been? l've just seen the courier from the clipper.
-He brought the message.
-Well, give it to me.
Come on.
[READlNG lN GERMAN]
''He is forbidden to contact any agents known to you. ''
Max!
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHlNG ]
We have a message for you.
-You've got no business to come here.
-We were ordered to come.
BlLL:
This kind of thing's dangerous.
We weren't followed.
This is from Elsa. You are to send it immediately. This is important. l have to put this in code.
That takes time.
-Do it right away.
CONRAD: Wait a minute.
Did you say you can reach Hamburg with this?
That's what he said.
You are crazy. Look at the coils.
They're only 2 and a half meters.
This wouldn't carry more than 20 or 30 miles.
This isn't the stuff we got you.
That's right, l've made a few improvements.
This setup wouldn't carry across the Atlantic.
BlLL:
How do you know?
Because l'm going to try it.
Go ahead.
The call signal's AOR.
[HlGH-PlTCHED HUMMlNG ]
-That's not Bill sending. l know his fist.
-Better answer it.
[BEEPlNG ]
What's that?
That's not Hamburg.
There is no mush. lt's coming from somewhere nearby.
-Where's it coming from?
-How would l know? lt's not up to me to ask questions. l follow instructions the same as you.
Maybe it's a relay station picking up messages. . .
. . .from this and boosting them across when conditions are right.
That's a new one.
BlLL: Transmissions across the Atlantic are uncertain. l can't sit here all day waiting to send messages. l don't believe you, mister.
-Elsa wants to see you.
-What for?
She don't want you to send no messages.
What's up, Max?
Got a message from Hamburg.
-Him?
-Yeah.
Elsa wants to see him.
CONRAD:
Get going.
[CLATTERlNG ]
[GRUNTlNG ]
HAMMERSOHN:
What'll that do? lt'll make him talk. lt takes time. Three injections. ln about an hour, he'll be answering questions.
But what'll it do to him?
He'll tell the truth.
Scopolamine, drugs part of the brain. l want to know about that envelope and his radio and a lot of other things.
We've got the picture of the pickup at the shop.
Lange's identified the man.
Good. Match that with all the film we've got on the Christopher case. . .
. . .the Vadja house, Dietrich's office, the gown shop, everything.
Right. Call you from the projection room.
That's the man who picked up the book.
Lange's confirmed that.
And that's the match.
No question about it. Freda Kassel's husband is Mr. Christopher.
-The third member of that household.
-The man posing as her husband.
BRlGGS: Yeah, come on. We're going out and pick up Mr. Christopher.
-Wake up. Wake up and talk.
-We can wait.
You're not going any place. Come on.
[DOOR BUZZlNG ]
We're special agents of the FBl.
You're under arrest.
Where did you send that information?
-Give him another shot.
-That won't do any good.
Well, he's no good to us as he is.
What's the range of your radio?
Thirty miles.
And someone relays your messages to Hamburg?
-Yes.
JOHANNA: Who?
Who operates the relay?
You sold the others out, didn't you?
You had them arrested.
Uh. . . .
[WHlSPERS] Everything looks all right.
See if you can find a phone downstairs. lf he doesn't tell us what we want to know, shoot him.
Look, let's not lose our heads.
[lNTERCOM BUZZlNG ]
-Yes?
-l'm a special agent of the FBl.
The apartment is surrounded.
-What is it?
-We'll give you exactly two minutes.
Women will come out first.
The men will follow, hands above their heads. lt's the FBl.
We've got two minutes.
Burn everything. Put it in the fireplace.
Johanna, bring me the papers on Process 97.
We've already failed once today, we cannot fail again.
Nothing matters except getting this information through. Nothing.
There's one chance left.
To contact the courier from Hamburg. l've got to get out of here.
You cover for me.
Delay them all you can. lt may mean the lives of every single one of us. . .
. . .but this must be on its way to Hamburg tonight.

Thus ended the Christopher case.
Elsa Gebhardt, alias Mr. Christopher...
... was no more successful
than other foreign espionage agents.
Process 97...
... the atomic bomb...
...America 's top war secret,
remains a secret.
After the United States went to war,
December 7th, 194 1...
... 1 6,440 enemy agents, saboteurs...
...and dangerous enemy aliens
were arrested.
Six have already been executed.
Thousands were interned.
Others were in prison
for a sum total of 1 880 years.
All of the thoroughly laid enemy plans
for a fifth column...
... were smashed before
they could be put into operation.
Not one single
act of enemy-directed sabotage...
... was perpetrated
within the United States...
...nor was one major
war secret stolen.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation

Hey, wire.
Wire. They've drawn a fence across there.
Them plow-pushers must have put it up there last night.
Give me them wire cutters.
I'll fix this.
Cow herders!
Hey, cornhuskers!
Shad Wilkins, you've been tried and found guilty of the most serious crime west of the Pecos, to wit, shooting a steer.
Got anything to say for yourself before the sentence of the court is executed?
I told you they shot at me first!
I didn't mean to kill that steer on purpose!
I was aiming at the man.
It's your bad luck you missed him.
That's the trouble with you sodbusters, you can't shoot straight.
Shad, may the Lord have mercy on your soul. Hey!
Buck, I want to see you.
Well, how's the hanging, there?
Well, his neck didn't hardly stretch a foot.
Here's to the greatest woman in the world, the fairest flower that ever bloomed,
- Lily Langtry.
- Miss Langtry.
Hold it, boys.
Did you hear the toast, stranger?
To Lily Langtry? I thought you meant your friends.
I didn't know that included me.
That includes every man that drinks at my bar.
Glad to join you. Have you ever met Miss Langtry?
No, I never met her. I never met the sun, I never shook hands with the moon, and I've never been introduced to no clouds.
That's all right. Too bad Lily
Langtry couldn't have heard that.
Did you ever see her?
No, I was in England once, but didn't get around to it.
Oh, you was in England once, and you could have seen her,
- but you never got around to it, eh?
- Yeah.
- Get out of my bar.
- Huh?
Get out of my bar!
- To the Jersey Lily.
Miss Langtry.
Here's how.
All right, Mort, if Shad's good and cold, you can have him.
$4, that's all he had. I'll make it up to you on the next one.
Get off.
- What you got there?
- A horse thief, Judge.
Prisoner of the bar.
- Get in there.
Chickenfoot, the law.
Hear ye, hear ye, court of Vinegarroon is now in session.
What's the charge?
We caught him on Chickenfoot's horse that was stole last week.
- My horse Pete? Where's he at?
- Right outside.
Well, so it is. Pete.
No, Your Honor. I was just trying to get the lay of the land.
- You will, too, at the end of a rope.
Southeast, no anticipating.
Hey, Judge! Judge, that is my old sabino pony. He's tied right out there.
People of Vinegarroon again...
You can use any name you like.
Cole Harden.
What are you doing in Vinegarroon?
- Oh, just passing through.
- Homesteader?
- No.
Where do you hail from?
- No place in particular.
Where are you heading for?
- No place special.
- Oh, saddle bum, huh?
Well, it's all right to live on a horse if it's your own horse.
Bart, turn loose the prisoner's hands. Chickenfoot, swear him in.
Do you swear to tell the truth... So help you?
Take off your hat!
Well, now, I'll tell you, son...
Are you Bean?
- Judge Roy W. Bean.
- My name's Jane Ellen Mathews.
Yes, Miss Mathews, what can I do for you?
- What have you done with Shad Wilkins?
- Shad Wilkins?
He was working in the fields when some of your wranglers came up and took him away.
Shad Wilkins. Shad Wilkins.
Oh, yeah, he was hanging around out there a while back, but he ain't around now.
Your men not only took him away, but they tore down the fence.
Not a stick of it was left standing.
That so?
Yes, that's so, and you needn't pretend you don't know about it.
Well, it don't surprise me none.
It's against the law to build fences hereabouts.
- What law? Whose law?
- Mine.
- Now, you listen to me, Mr. Bean.
- Judge Bean.
You're no more a judge than I am. Just call yourself a judge.
I wouldn't say that if I was you. I might consider it contempt of court.
It's contempt, all right.
You call this a court?
I do, and it happens to be in session right now.
Southeast, get the young lady a chair.
Now, you sit down, Miss Mathews, and
I'll tend to your case in a minute.
You're charged with stealing a horse. Guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Where's exhibit A?
- Huh?
Where's the horse? Bring in the horse, Chickenfoot.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, horse.
Miss Mathews, when cattle can't get to water, they die.
There's miles of river on each side of our homestead.
This country's unfenced rangeland.
It always was, and always will be.
Get in there. All right, give me room there, you guys.
Come on, get in there.
Whoa, Pete. Come on in here.
Come on, get over there.
Give us a little room.
All right, Judge, there he is.
Mr. Harden, it's my duty to inform you that the larceny of an equine is a capital offense, punishable by death, but you can rest assured that, in this court, a horse thief always gets a fair trial before he's hung.
- Chickenfoot, that's your horse?
- Oh, why, Judge...
Can you prove it's your horse?
Why, Judge, anybody here... I can prove it by Pete himself that he's my horse.
Pete, you're my horse, ain't you?
Ownership of horse clearly established. It belongs to Chickenfoot.
That's my ruling.
Well, I don't contest it, Your
Honor. Maybe the horse does belong to Chickenfoot here, but I didn't steal it.
- How'd you get it then?
- I bought it.
Order in the court!
- That all you got to say?
- That's all.
No, it's not. I'm not going to stay here and see anybody railroaded like this.
Miss Mathews, I don't recollect you was summoned as a witness in this trial.
What kind of a trial is it when a prisoner isn't even allowed to have anybody speak for him?
You an attorney, Miss?
I'm as much an attorney as you are a judge.
- You know this man?
- No, I don't.
- You ever see him before?
- No, but...
- Can you prove he didn't steal the horse?
- No.
Then he don't need no lawyer then.
This man was caught on a stolen horse, and in this jurisdiction, that's prima facie evidence.
- The case is closed and that's my ruling.
- Yes, and it's just like all your rulings!
The courtroom will now be cleared of everybody, excepting the judge, the jury, the prisoner, the witnesses and...
I guess that means you.
All right, I'll go. I don't want to see anymore.
It's murder, that's what it is. Murder.
This man hasn't got a chance, and you know it, but you never give anybody a chance.
You didn't give us one when you stampeded the cattle over our crops.
You thought you'd starve the homesteaders out, but you didn't.
You can pester us and rob us and kill us, but you can't stop us.
'Cause there'll always be more coming. More and more.
And we'll stay on our farms in spite of you, and your courtroom and your killers!
By gobs, she's all right.
She'd make a good cattleman.
If it wasn't for Lily, I'd marry her.
Giddap.
You heard the case against the accused, pro and con.
Now I guess maybe you'd better retire to consider a verdict.
Chickenfoot, you'd better take
Pete out for a little fresh air.
Take him out, Bart. I got work to do.
And while you retire, there'll be a recess for them that's thirsty.
Well, I guess you can't take it with you.
It's got to be strictly understood you ain't making no effort to influence the sober judgment of the jury.
- Certainly not.
- There you are.
- Compliments of the prisoner.
- Jury to the rear!
Bull's-eye.
- Join me, Your Honor?
- Don't mind if I do.
Don't spill none of that liquor, son. It eats right into the bar.
To the unfortunate lady with the bullet in her face.
The man that fired that bullet was hauled out of here feet first.
And he ought to be.
Any man that'd shoot at a picture of Lily Langtry ought to be killed.
It's just retribution.
It's justifiable homicide, that was my ruling.
Right.
You an admirer of Miss Lily's, too?
Well, that's putting it mildly.
She's the most beautiful woman I ever met.
Met?
You mean to tell me you met Lily
Langtry, the real her, in the flesh?
Oh, many times.
What an actress.
How'd you get to know her?
Well, that's a long story, Judge.
Bart, you and Blackjack get yourself a drink, huh?
Mighty fine liquor. What do you call it?
- Rub of the brush. Go on.
- Rub of the brush?
- Did you get to know her real well?
- It's got character.
I said, did you get to know her real well?
Now, Judge, you forget a gentleman never discusses a lady in a barroom.
Who said it's a barroom? This is a courtroom.
Say, tell me, is she as pretty as them pictures?
Why, the picture's never been made that can do justice to Lily Langtry.
Is she good-natured?
An angel.
- I'll never forget the night we met.
- Yeah?
I'll never forget it as long as I live.
Who was that?
Oh, that's Mort Borrow.
He cleans up around here.
Go on about Lily.
Oh, yeah, Lily.
How about a verdict?
Can't you see we're still considering the evidence?
Two aces. COWBOY
Bet a dollar and a half.
Stay once.
Get away from here. You smell of formaldehyde!
I'll call that.
You been down around Lanno Bay, ain't you?
Sure.
Well, you know how it is at sunset.
You can look out and that water ain't exactly blue, and it ain't exactly purple.
It's a kind of color a man can feel, but he can't put a name to.
Yeah.
Well, that's Lily's eyes.
By gobs!
I'm out. COWBOY
I'll stay out. Here we go.
Got 10. Got a nine.
You know how bright and coppery and gold-like a young chestnut horse is running in the bright sun?
- Yeah.
- Well, her hair is something like that.
In the daytime.
You mean it's different at night?
Well, not different, but just sort of more so.
- How so?
- Well...
Well, you know how it is at dusk when you see a prairie fire reflected in the sky.
A sort of a deep... A beautiful kind of blushing...
- Red?
- Red.
- Well, that'll give you a rough idea.
- By gobs.
I got a lock of her hair.
You mean to tell me you actually got the real... From her head?
I don't suppose you'd ever part with that lock of hair, no matter what a man was willing to give?
A man don't trade things like that.
You see that sword up there?
I wore it in the civil war.
Always meant to be buried with it.
Now, if you was willing to swap, why...
Would you really like to have it?
I'd rather own it than the state of Texas. Let's have a look at it.
I haven't got it with me.
Where's it at?
It's with my stuff in El Paso.
So, you was in the civil war, huh, Judge?
- El Paso, huh?
- Yeah.
- Cavalry, huh?
- I suppose you could write for it.
Yeah.
Wouldn't take long to get here by mail coach.
Oh, two, three weeks.
- Two or three weeks, huh?
- Yeah, about.
But I wouldn't part with that lock of hair for anything in the world.
The jury's ready, Judge.
That bottle of whiskey gone already?
Yeah, and if he ain't paid for it, you better start collecting now.
- What's the verdict?
- You know what the verdict is. Guilty.
There's only one thing I can do.
You're sentenced to hang, that's my ruling.
Turn loose the prisoner's hands.
- But, Judge, you just ruled...
- I didn't finish my ruling.
The court sentenced the prisoner to hang, but the court didn't say when. So long as there's reasonable doubt...
What reasonable doubt, Judge?
We just caught him with Chickenfoot's horse.
- Ain't any room for doubt.
- Order!
I been talking to the prisoner.
He's a friend of Lily Langtry's.
Stands to reason no friend of Lily
Langtry goes around stealing horses.
Leastways, there's a reasonable doubt.
You mean, you're setting aside your own ruling?
That ain't what I said. When
I make a ruling, it stands.
But, Judge, you just sentenced the man.
His sentence is suspended for a couple weeks until I can look into the matter further.
That's my ruling.
- Hi, Mort. How's business?
- Just lost a customer.
Well, I'll be down for a shave in a minute.
All right, you're next.
- Howdy, Judge.
- Hello, Evans.
Jersey Lily special.
Pardon me, you don't happen to have a twin brother, do you?
No, not me.
Well, you'd better pay me that money you owe me.
You're loco, brother.
I don't owe you nothing.
You owe me $60.
If you're interested, that's the man that sold me the roan horse.
Then, he's the man that stole...
$84 and 6 bits.
Fined $80 for disorderly conduct, and $4 and 6 bits for carrying concealed weapons.
Now, you men get some rope and string him up.
String him up? Why, he's dead already.
We hang horse thieves, don't we? String him up!
Come inside, son.
You can have his horse and outfit.
- Rub of the brush?
- Rub of the brush.
- El Paso.
- El Paso.
Good morning, Judge.
Who are you?
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Stranger. Stranger, come here.
Straighten out my neck, would you? Grab a hold of my head.
Now, jerk it quick.
Thank you. It's my neck.
You see I was hung once, but my friends cut me down in time.
Now when I don't live right, why, the crick comes back on me.
Now, who are you, anyhow?
And what are you doing here?
Why, don't you remember?
Why, I'm the fellow that filled the inside straight, and won Chickenfoot's horse.
So long, Judge.
Hey, Pete, are you glad I won you from Chickenfoot?
Well, that makes it nice.
Here.
Wait!
Wait!
That lock of hair, Lily's hair, you promised to write to El Paso for it. Don't you remember? We drank on it.
When are you going to do it?
Huh?
- You ain't going to crawfish?
- No, the first post office I come to.
Straighten her out, would you, son?
Thank you.
You mangy old scorpion, you might have got us both killed.
- What you want to go to California for?
- See the Pacific Ocean.
It's just like the gulf down at Lanno Bay.
It's bigger.
Why don't you stay around Vinegarroon awhile?
We could have a lot of fun together.
We could talk about Lily and...
No, I'm on my way.
Listen, it's a great country here, west of the Pecos.
A fellow could really make something of himself.
Why, when I first come here, I didn't have nothing.
Now, I'm boss of the whole section.
Well, that's mighty fine, Judge.
You know, I cottoned to you the first time I seen you.
Why don't you put in with me?
Well, I tell you, Judge, it's nice of you to ask me, but I'm heading for California, and nothing short of hanging can stop me.
Wait a minute. You can't go.
You're under suspended sentence.
- Why, you hung Mr. Evans for that.
- Huh?
You're under suspendence, anyhow.
Who are you? What do I know about you?
How do I know they ain't looking for you?
You're under arrest for disorderly conduct, for disturbing the peace, vagrancy, and you're on the way back to town with me, and that's my ruling!
So long, Judge.
By gobs, he stole my gun.
We hired out for farm work, Miss, not a civil war.
This ain't no fit place to homestead in.
Land's no good when there's always lead flying over it.
If you'd shoot back, maybe they'd stop bothering you.
We did shoot back.
And so did Shad Wilkins, and he ain't trying it no more.
What about your own quarter section?
- If you leave, you'll lose it.
- We don't want no part of it.
All right, Hod. If you feel that way, we'll try to get along with just Eph and Henry.
Not me.
Henry, if we only had one man, it'd be a big help.
Sorry, Mr. Mathews.
Call themselves men.
Wade, what do we do?
- I know what to do.
- No, no, wait. That's not the way.
Don't even think of it.
Wade, aren't you going to stay for supper?
I'll be back.
Well, they left.
Of course they have. What did you expect?
My hands quit, too. You can't blame them for leaving.
There won't be a hired man left in this part of the country if we don't do something about it.
We hire new hands, same thing will happen.
What's old Mathews going to say about it?
He keeps passing the buck to the Lord Jehovah.
I say, let's do something about it ourselves.
- That's right.
- That's what I like to hear.
Let's give the judge the same thing he gave Shad Wilkins.
Maybe if some of us went down and appealed to Roy Bean for justice...
Justice. If you'd seen him yesterday, pretending to try that prisoner...
The man didn't have a chance.
- I wonder if they hanged him.
- Don't they always?
He was the same as dead even while he stood there.
I've kept on seeing his face all day.
What is it, Daughter?
The man I told you about, the one that was hanged.
I saw him plain as day, looking in the window.
You're seeing things, Jane
Ellen. There's nobody out there.
I saw his face, I tell you.
Come in.
Good evening.
Pardon me for intruding like this.
Oh, no, you're not. It's just... Well, I thought you were a ghost.
Well, I guess you're partly to blame I'm not.
- I just stopped in to thank you.
- Father, this is Mister...
- Harden.
- Welcome, Mr. Harden, welcome.
Glad to meet you.
Oh, Mr. Harden, this is our neighbor Wade Harper.
This is the man I told you about.
You mean to tell me Bean tried you, and let you go?
Well, she was my lawyer. I guess she's the one that got me off.
- I knew you weren't a horse thief.
- Thanks.
How did you know that?
I just knew.
Are you working anywhere?
No, I'm heading for California.
Mr. Harden, I suppose a body that's just been hanged is apt to be a bit hungry.
You must stay for supper.
- Well, I don't want to put you out any.
- Oh, no, not at all.
Matter of fact, we had some company that just disappointed us.
Uh-huh. We were hoping somebody'd show up to take their place.
Make yourself at home, now. Make yourself at home.
Wait till you sink your teeth into some of Jane Ellen's stew.
Oh, Lord, for that which thou hast sent us in our hour of need, make us truly grateful.
Bless this food to our use and ourselves to thy service. Amen.
Let me help you.
How about some hominy?
- Here, Wade. Give him some milk.
- All right, all right.
Give him some milk.
I think he likes it here. I think we got him.
- What's he doing now?
- Feeding his horse.
Wade, he could probably take the place of two men. He's so big and strong.
- Well, I don't know how strong he is.
- Strong enough, Wade.
Now, Jane Ellen, we'll leave you alone with him, and you kind of add on a little more welcome.
- What'll I say?
- Oh, just keep smiling at him.
And, Daughter, if it should come up natural
- like, you might hint what a handsome man he is.
Handsome?
We need him terribly bad, Daughter.
We got to get that corn husked.
We need him terribly bad.
- Listen, your father don't mean for you to...
- Shh.
Look out.
Everything all right, Mr. Harden?
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. Now, I'll go see about your bunk.
- Oh, don't trouble.
- No trouble at all. Come on, Wade.
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Well, I won't argue with you.
If I had to wash dishes,
I guess I'd give up eating.
Well, what do you do about the dishes when you're home?
Home? What? You mean in a house?
Well, you live in a house, don't you?
No. No, my house is all out there, all one room with a sky for a roof.
- Well, it's a big place.
- Got some space to rent.
Well, I guess California's your next stop, huh?
California, but I don't stop. Oregon next, I guess.
Well, all places aren't just the same.
Wouldn't you rather stay a little longer in some places?
No, they're all the same, beautiful when you leave them.
Well, it's like the turtles.
Carry their houses with them.
If I had to build me a house, I'd have it on wheels.
Not me. I'd want my house so that nothing could ever move it.
So down deep that an earthquake couldn't shake it, and a cyclone would be just another wind going by.
Well, you say, "Who wants to be a turtle?"
And I say, "I hope you'll be very happy in your house. "
- Well...
- Oh, say, wait a minute.
What?
I'll bet I know something we could agree on.
What's that?
Well, in about a week now, we're going to husk the corn, and I'll bet you'll agree that that's fun.
Well, you know, I think husking corn's the greatest fun in the world.
- Husking corn, fun?
- Oh, yes!
- Well, I'd rather wash dishes.
- Oh, no.
It was a fine supper, and good cooking.
Oh, Mr. Harden.
What a handsome man you are.
I doubt that, but I'm a tired one.
Well, I hope I see you in the morning before I leave.
Get out of here! Hey!
If anybody'd told me yesterday
I'd be playing tag in a cornfield with a lot of cows...
If we had some men that would ride fence, there wouldn't be any cows in the cornfield.
You were sure cute last night.
Now you're making fun of me.
Well, that's... That's more fun than picking corn.
Hey, look at your father. I wonder what's up.
I tried to stop them.
They wouldn't listen to me.
Wade!
Yes, yes. It's the wrong and lawless thing to do.
- I begged them not to. I told them.
- Who? What happened?
Wade Harper has rounded up some of the men.
They going to town to lynch Judge Bean.
- When did they leave?
- About an hour ago.
They took our wagon.
Thunder and lightning! You back from California already?
You got to get out of here, and don't stop for nothing.
Did you write to El Paso?
Listen, just get on your horse and get, because they're after you.
Did you write? Who's after me?
The homesteaders. They're going to string you up.
Why, that bunch of plow-pushing sod!
They're outside right now, a whole wagonload of them.
A wagonload? Why, I can handle a train load of them.
I'll tear their livers out.
What'll it be, gentlemen?
It'll be Roy Bean. Where is he?
He's out for a while.
That's because you came down here and warned him.
Make a move and I'll kill you.
Cole, start collecting them shotguns, uncork them rifles now and set them down this end of the bar, easy-like.
Go on.
Get back. Get back.
Now, I'll take yours, Judge.
The drinks are on me, gentlemen.
We're not drinking with you, Harden, nor him, either.
I ain't serving none of my liquor to no bunch of tomato-kissing,
- plow-pushing...
- Now, Judge, we don't want any harsh words to spoil this friendly little get-together.
Get-together?
Why, this pack of weasels invade the dignity of my courtroom, come in here armed with malice aforethought to kick up a rumpus...
Now, look, you being a judge, you know there's always two sides to any question.
These men have come here with a legitimate grievance.
We're not asking you to speak for us, Harden.
No, nor me, either.
Well, that makes it unanimous. I'm going to talk for the both of you.
There's a law here against fencing land that seems nothing short of murder to people raising crops, but it's common sense to men running cattle.
I've seen this kind of war before.
It's happening now, back in Kansas and Nebraska.
The cattlemen came in first, then the homesteaders moved in and fenced them out.
They had crops for one year, and then a dry spell, drought, so the homesteaders moved out, and the rush and thistle and jimson moved in.
And the big spaces were all broken up by little quarter sections, and the homesteads left empty, and the houses caved in, and the land, no good for man or cattle.
You spoiled the land, then you came here to spoil this land.
This here's a big country.
Yea, but it ain't big enough for cattlemen and homesteaders, and it never will be.
Now, clear out here. That's my ruling.
All right, Bean, we're going.
We're going back to build our fences.
If you do, you better build coffins along with them. Now, get.
You sure told them off, son.
Yep, and now I'm going to tell you off.
I'm sorry I stopped them from lynching you.
They got a right to defend their homesteads.
You know this ain't homestead land. You just said so yourself.
- The government didn't say so.
- I'm the government here.
Judas Priest, I don't see how you can talk up for scum like that.
They proved up on their land, and they got deeds to it.
When you make war on them, you're making war on their women and kids, too.
Those people were starved out last year.
I heard about those cattle being stampeded over their crops, and there's too many strays running loose in that valley right now, only they're not strays.
What do you want me to do? Arrest them cattle, and fine them a couple dollars apiece for trespass?
Now, look, those people don't take up much room with their little shirt-sized pieces of land.
Why don't you be a real judge for all of the people?
Why don't you try to see their side of it, and help them instead of fight them?
Make peace around here instead of war.
There's plenty of room for everybody, then everybody'd look up to you.
And then someday, maybe they'd put up a statue out there in the street, a statue with a carving on it.
"To Roy Bean, the real judge. "
What are you doing? Catching a fish?
I guess I'm wasting my time.
Hold on, wait a minute. You write that letter to El Paso yet?
- No!
- You promised. We drank on it.
I didn't have to write it.
I had it on me all the time.
You did? Well, why didn't you give it to me then?
You old bullhead, if I'd have given it to you, you'd have hung me.
Wouldn't you?
- I might've at that. Let's have a look at it.
- I haven't got it with me.
Suffering, bleeding
Chickamauga! Where's it at?
I left it over at the Mathews' place.
- How is she?
- Huh?
- I'll ride right over with you.
- No, no.
You mean you're gonna crawfish?
You ain't going to give it to me?
- Sure, I'll give it to you.
- When?
When the last steer's out of the valley.
All right, I'll pass the word around to the boys.
No, you don't. You're going to help run those cattle out, and I'm going along with you to see that it's done.
Don't you trust me, Cole?
When I was a kid, I had a pet rattlesnake.
I was fond of it, but I wouldn't turn my back on it.
You're all right.
I'm going back now, and gathering my stuff for the roundup.
- And that lock of hair.
- Yeah, yeah, the lock of hair.
He defended Bean. He said he was right.
Said the homesteaders spoiled this land for the cattlemen. We all heard it.
I don't care what you heard.
He couldn't be two-faced.
He's not that kind.
If he took Bean's part, he only did it to stop trouble.
Miss Mathews, looks like every time I get into trouble, you always speak up for me.
They're trying to tell me you spoke up for Bean.
Well, I did try to tell them Bean's point of view.
There you are.
It's always been my experience that when you know the other fellow's point of view, you usually get together.
Well, why didn't you tell him our point of view?
I did, and we got together.
You won't have to patrol your fields any longer.
Judge gave me his word they'd round up all cattle in this valley and take them out of here.
You think he'd keep his word?
Well, I'm going along with him to see that he does.
Well, what makes you think we'd take your word?
Take it or leave it.
Harden, you're a sneak and a liar.
Miss Mathews!
I'll be back.
California's that way.
I got something to tell you before I go.
- Well?
- How's Wade?
He's fine, just fine.
You know, you're not the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Well, that's great news. Who asked you?
But you've got the prettiest hair I ever saw.
Why do you like to make fun of me?
'Cause I like you, I guess.
- And you think my hair's pretty, huh?
- I never saw anything like it.
- Oh, could I clip a lock?
- No, you can't.
- Will you clip one?
- No, I won't.
Come around here, take sides with Bean, and knock out my best friend, and...
Tell you how much I like you, and how much I might miss you?
- All right?
- No.
Here, these are yours.
Well, thanks a lot.
Jane Ellen!
Go on, Cole. Go on.
Well, so I says to her...
I said, "Miss Langtry,
"do you plan to go back to England when you finish your American tour?"
And she said to me... She said,
"No. " Said she loved the
United States too much.
- Yeah?
- She planned to stay here for the rest of her life.
She told me that when she got all through her work in the theater, that she wanted to settle down someplace out here in the West.
By gobs.
Some quiet little place way out on the range, away from all the lights and the crowds.
She kept asking about Texas especially.
She says that ever since she was a little girl, she'd heard about Texas, and it'd always been the dream of her life to have a home here someday.
- She did?
- She did.
Last herd just come in, Judge.
Well?
Huh?
Oh.
By gobs!
A lock of her own hair!
It's kind of dark, ain't it?
Yeah, she uses lots of shampoo on her hair.
She does?
It's beautiful. Beautiful.
I'll never forget this, Cole. Never.
- Let me see it, will you?
- What for?
I ain't going to keep it.
I'd like to see you try.
- All right?
- All right.
I know how you feel, son.
Almighty God, we offer thee thanksgiving for thy help and thy divine bounty.
Thou has poured thy blessings on our land.
Thou hast visited the
Earth and made it plenteous.
Thou hast made it soft with drops of rain,
and the land that was desolate has become like a garden,
and the waste places are become fenced and are inhabited.
Thou hast made the tree of the field yield her fruit,
and the Earth, her increase.
Thou hast broken the bonds of our yoke and delivered us out of the hands of our enemies, so that we shall dwell here safely, and none shall make us afraid, and for this, thy divine bounty,
Oh, Lord, we thank thee. Amen.
Amen.
- Amen.
One foot up and the other foot down
Swing them pretty girls 'round and 'round
Here it is.
- What?
Tell me something first.
Where do you keep my lock of hair?
Oh, uh...
Show me.
Nobody can see that, not even you.
Look, Cole, the best piece of homestead land in the whole country.
It used to belong to one of the hired men that left us, and now it's anybody's. You just claim it.
Yeah, that's a fine piece of land all right.
Yeah, look at the feed on those slopes over there, and that strip along the bottom is just fine for wheat or corn.
And, Cole, look, that little knoll right there, it's just begging for a house.
- Do you know how to build a house?
- No, how?
Well, you... You...
Well, you have the kitchen there, and the bedroom over there, and the living room right in the middle.
It would have to have the right things in it, too.
What sort of things?
Oh, fires and lamplights, warm beds, the smell of coffee in the morning, the sound of rain on the roof.
Gee, that's a nice house, Jane Ellen.
Jane!
Look!
Go to your homes!
Protect your houses!
Hey, Wade, grab another team, we'll take a section of rail fence and knock down a strip of corn.
Maybe we can start a backfire.
Take the two end sections, Wade!
Cole! Cole! Cole!
Hey, get out of here! Move!
Look, the house!
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Father!
Help! Help!
Come on, hurry up!
- Watch out for his leg and shoulder.
All right.
Take it easy.
- Have you seen Jane Mathews?
No.
So I hereby christen this town Langtry!
No man ever gave a woman a whole town afore, but I'm doing it, and from now on, this whole section's going to bloom like the Jersey Lily herself!
Quiet! I ain't through yet.
Miss Langtry's coming soon to play a night in Fort Davis, and I want every legal resident of Langtry, Texas, to go over and see the godmother of this here town, a town of cattlemen, for cattlemen, and by gobs, run by cattlemen!
Now, in honor of this great occasion,
I'm dishing out free beer to one and all, and anybody found sober after sundown is liable to arrest for disorderly conduct, and that's my ruling!
Start the music!
"And man that is born of woman has but a short time to live.
"He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.
"He fleeth as if it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.
"In the midst of life, we are in death. "
The wagon train's left. The people have all gone, Jane Ellen.
I'm staying. Nobody's going to drive me away from my land, not with cattle, or fire, or killing my father, or anything else.
I'll be here long after Bean and his gang of murderers are gone.
Sure you will, and me, too.
I don't want you.
I don't want any of Roy
Bean's friends around.
Wade Harper was right. I didn't believe it then, but I do now.
You knew we were going to be burned out.
That's why you herded all the cattle out, so they wouldn't be burned with our crops.
No, I don't need your help. Not now.
I can do what I have to do alone.
I'll be back.
Why, Cole!
By gobs, man, I'm glad to see you.
Why, I never wanted to see a man so much before in my life.
- What for?
- What for?
Don't you know what for?
She's coming to Fort Davis.
- Lily Langtry's coming to Fort Davis.
- Langtry?
Langtry, yeah, and you and me are going over there together.
You're going to introduce me to her. By gobs, I'm going to meet her.
- I just can't believe it.
- I want to talk to you, Judge.
Yeah, all right. And look what
I got to tell her when I see her.
Langtry, that's the name of this town, a great town after a great woman.
- I said I wanted to talk to you, Judge.
- Sure.
Cole, it's a great day.
I tell you, it's the greatest day in the history of Texas.
- Some fire, huh?
- Yeah, wasn't it, though?
- Yeah, too bad.
- Yeah.
Yep.
- I wonder who was behind it?
- Oh, a fire don't need nothing behind it.
Fire has a way of moving on its own. Here's how.
Before I drink with you, Judge, I want to know you had nothing to do with it.
Me? Why, how can you say a thing like that?
Didn't I round up all them cattle for you?
Wasn't I right here in the saloon when the fire broke out?
Didn't...
Well, I was, and what's more,
I ain't got no idea who done it.
Now, drink up.
- Don't you believe me?
- No.
Now, listen, son, I told you how it was, and I don't want you calling me no liar.
Now, drink hearty.
Will you swear by that?
There ain't no reason I should, but I'm willing.
All right, I swear by my sword there I had nothing to do with it.
I swear by the revised statutes.
By gobs, if there was a Bible in town I'd...
Where's that lock of hair?
- Right here with me.
- Let me see it.
Swear on that?
All right, it was me. I burned their houses and crops.
- I run them varmints out.
- Nice going.
And if you think...
If you think I'm sorry, you're crazy.
I'm proud and glad I rid the country of them.
It was either them or us, and now the range grass will grow back, and some day, the cattlemen will put up a statue of me out there on the street, and they'll write on it,
"Judge Roy Bean, he give us back the land. "
You get warrants in Fort Davis, don't you?
Yeah, that's where they get them, but they don't know how to spell my name.
- It's been tried before.
- I'll get one.
This time, you're going to get what's coming to you, Judge.
Cole!
You and me's friends. I done what I had to, and you think it was wrong.
But if it was my own son come over here with a warrant, he'd have to be first on the draw.
I aim to be, unless I get it in the back before I get out of here.
So long, Cole.
Make out a warrant against Roy Bean.
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to carry out the duties of deputy sheriff in Jeff Davis County in the state of Texas?
Yep.
Thanks, Sheriff.
How much are tickets?
$2 apiece, all over the house.
First come, first served.
- How many seats in the house?
- Four hundred.
- I'll take them.
- How many?
All of them.
Much obliged.
Let me have two tickets.
If I was you, Judge, I wouldn't set foot in Fort Davis to see Adam and Eve.
Me, either.
A deputy's star makes the finest kind of a target.
How you know you're not heading into a trap?
Sure looking for trouble, going over to Fort Davis.
Taking an awful chance, Judge.
Them hombres just waiting down there for you.
Why, you pack of yellow bellies, give me them tickets.
You mean, you're going to Fort Davis alone?
Not by a jugful, I ain't.
You're all going with me as a guard of honor, right up to the opera house, but I'm going in alone.
I don't want nobody in there with me no how.
I ain't sharing the Jersey Lily with no one.
Now, come on, we got a day's ride ahead of us.
I'm going to dress, and you fellows proud yourselves up a bit.
Chickenfoot, my sword.
I ain't wore this uniform since Chickamauga, but it still fits right smart.
Bean and his men are coming! Get off the street!
Bean and his men are coming!
Bean's coming! Bean's coming!
Hey, look!
They must have heard I was coming.
All right, boys, take your places.
Hey, this is the stage entrance.
Now, remember, I want strict privacy all during the show.
You'll get it.
Third seat in.
- Pardon, sir, your seat is back here.
- No, it ain't. It's right here.
Say, when does Miss Langtry go on the play?
Right after the curtain.
She's about to go up now, sir.
- Go up?
- The curtain, sir.
Now?
Yes, now.
Now.
Don't make a move, Judge.
I'm coming down to get you.
Come shooting.
- The war's on.
- Yeah.
Wish I was in there to see that show.
- I bet the judge is having a good time.
- Yeah.
Hey!
Let's you and me stand up and shoot it out.
That suits me, Judge.
Put up your gun. We'll draw.
All right.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Now, you see what you done?
You stopped the show.
I was going to see Lily.
Now it's too late.
No, it isn't, Judge.
She's back there now, waiting to see you.
What?
She knows all about you,
Judge. She wants to meet you.
She told me so herself.
Come on, let's go back and see her.
My hat.
Where's Miss Langtry?
Put me down. I can walk.
Put me down, I tell you. That's my ruling.
Miss Langtry, I'd like to present an old admirer. Judge Roy Bean.
I'm pleased to meet you.
Cole, come here quick!
Look!
See, what did I tell you? They're coming back.
Wagons by the score.
It's the promised land.
Jane Ellen, someday, Texas is going to be the biggest and the finest...
Out of unsuspected skies,
a day of infamy dawned.
A nation at peace,
staggered by a treacherous blow.
Rallied and grimly gathered in strength to fight for existence.
But in those early months,
the war was still far off to most Americans.
Even amid the busy clatter of a West Coast Navy yard,
many still found time to play.
- Fine. - A little off your game, Commander.
Forty-love, match point coming up.
I can count!
Go ahead and serve.
Isn't that Lieutenant Masterman?
Yes. Lieutenant Masterman of the Harvard and Boston, Back Bay Mastermans.
Where the Cabbots only speak to the Lodges, and the Lodges speak only to the Mastermans.
Shot!
Thank you.
- He's quite athletic?
- Hm?
I mean, very good, isn't he?
Well, I suppose it has to come sooner or later.
You'd like to meet him, of course?
- Oh... - I recognize the symptoms, they all do.
- Hey Gregg!
- Hank!
Thought I left you moored in Washington.
When'd you drop anchor out here?
- Last night.
- Great. What's your duty?
- Destroyer.
- Serves you right.
Oh, pardon me, may I present
Lieutenant Gregg Masterman.
- Presently gracing the United
States Navy. - For the duration.
- Miss Susan Garrison, Miss Audrey Carr.
- How do you do?
Gregg and I put in three of the loveliest afternoons pushing each others faces in the mud.
They called it Navy versus
Harvard on the program.
Aren't you in charge of the reception for the
Senate Naval Affairs Committee, Lieutenant?
- Why yes, I am. - Oh, Mr. Masterman, anything we can do to help.
Well, the details are practically all taken care of, but the Admiral's Junior Aide doesn't have any partner for the dance.
- Would you...
- I'd love to!
Lucky dog, Admiral's
Junior Aide. Who is he?
I am.
Say, why don't you sit down and have a drink with us?
No, no thanks. I'm late for office hours...
Old Iron Pants is running the Navy by a clock.
- See you around, Hank.
- Right, Gregg.
Anything you want, just let me know.
- Goodbye, ladies.
- Goodbye.
Any word from the
Commandant's office yet?
- Not yet, sir.
- Holy smoke.
I wonder if they realize how long we've been tied up here.
Having a little trouble, sir?
A little? Plenty.
You don't happen to know Lieutenant
Masterman, the Admiral's Aide, do you?
- Why, yes. Very well.
- Is he still up at the club?
- No, he just left.
- About time.
- Something urgent?
- Urgent?
Only my ship here, the Crenshaw, you can see what happened.
Just made it in here yesterday morning, nothing's being done to make her ready for sea again.
What makes you think Masterman's keeping your ship tied up?
The repair plans and estimates have been on his desk since early yesterday.
There's a war on, you know?
Well, why don't you go straight to the admiral?
He just loves to have people come to him with their troubles.
I'm sure he'll straighten you out in no time.
Go south! Go south!
Yes, yes...
Old Iron Pants sure has a full head of steam up.
He sure has...
Yes, yes, I can hear you.
Yes, yes. Of course.
What's that?
The Warren? That hulk?
It didn't take an overhaul and refitting job to put her in shipshape, it took a miracle.
Why didn't you fellas build some ships while you had time?
What? Hm?
You know, I'm trying to get on with this job here.
Fine, fine.
Always glad to have one of these friendly chats with you.
Goodbye.
Resurrecting ships from the graveyard...
Masterman!
Masterman, the Warren is to be made ready for sea at once.
Sir?
Where's Masterman?
You're not Masterman.
No sir,
Lieutenant Commander Roberts.
The Executive Officer of the Crenshaw.
Lieutenant Masterman was not in his office, sir.
- So, I took the liberty.
- Oh... You took the liberty.
Do you realize, sir, that I am an island entirely surrounded by bright young men known as aides just to prevent people from taking the liberty?
There is an old custom in the Navy, sir, which demands that an officer should be announced to his commanding officer.
Begging the Admiral's pardon, sir, I'd hoped he'd dispense with formality for the moment.
- This is urgent. - Everything about this office is urgent.
Even "good morning" is a crisis.
But don't let that discourage you.
Thank you, sir. It's about my ship the Crenshaw.
In the absence of my commanding officer,
I'm responsible for her repairs.
What do you want me to do?
Roll out with a sailmakers palm and needle to hem stitch
- some plates onto your precious ship?
- No sir.
I'm just anxious to get back to sea, sir.
So am I.
I'm more anxious to get back to sea than you are.
But am I badgering the
Secretary of the Navy about it?
Yes, sir.
I think you are, sir.
Hm? Oh, you do, do you?
Well, you're quite right.
I am.
It's the only place for a sailor. At sea.
Yes sir, I think so too, sir.
Your face is familiar to me.
- Weren't we ever shipmates?
- No sir. I think not, sir.
Weren't you Charlie Harridge's communications officer on the old Norris destroyer, division seven, patrol 1918.
- Yes, sir.
- I knew it.
I never forget a face.
I was your division commander.
I was commissioned ensign from chief boatswain's mate the day we went into that action, sir.
Great show, Roberts.
- Great show.
- Yes, sir.
But this is a bigger one, sir.
Hm... Haven't got across?
Foreign service?
No, sir. I was retired as a lieutenant in '37.
The emergency put me back on the active list.
That's interesting.
So you want to get back to sea, do you, Roberts?
Yes, sir.
Have you ever heard of the destroyer, Warren?
You mean that old hulk that's been growing barnacles in the back bay at San Diego?
A ship of the United States Navy is not to be called a hulk.
Yes sir.
Particularly by her commanding officer.
Ye...
I beg your pardon, sir?
I said her commanding officer.
That's what you've been for the last 60 seconds.
You'll get your orders as soon as they can be written.
But she's older than the old Norris, sir.
She's been lying in a grave for the past 20 years.
For your information,
Mr. Roberts, this yard has resurrected her.
And she's a pretty healthy looking ghost.
She's got a lot of fight left in her.
But my own ship, the Crenshaw, sir.
With your permission,
I'd rather stay aboard.
Are you disputing my judgment, Mr. Roberts?
- No sir. - I am not interested in personalities, nor the preferences of individuals!
What's with the Admiral?
Lieutenant Commander Roberts of the Crenshaw, sir.
Roberts?
Oh yes, I remember.
The Warren is your ship now, Mr. Roberts.
I'll expect you to have her ready for sea at the earliest possible moment.
- Aye-aye, sir. - We have got to use everything we can float if we're going to survive.
You'll do a good job,
I'm sure. Good luck, Roberts.
- Pleasant cruise.
- Thank you, sir.
- Is that all?
- Isn't that enough?
Yes sir.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I see you took my advice.
- Are you...
- Masterman!
Why yes, I am.
Hope you got straightened out all right?
Mr. Masterman, you have a peculiar sense of humor.
Just the kind to get you in a lot of trouble.
- Masterman!
- Coming sir.
So sorry, the Admiral.
If I can be of any further assistance to you, don't hesitate to call on me.
Mr. Masterman, I expect my aides to be somewhere within hailing distance.
I thought perhaps your buzzer was out of commission, sir.
I was given a voice long before I rated a buzzer, and it's never out of commission!
- And much more effective, sir.
- What?
I'm sorry, sir. I had to step out of the office a moment to arrange the menu for the dinner to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee.
Here it is, sir. I thought we'd begin with oysters.
Oysters? I want the report on the damage to the Crenshaw.
Oh, that.
Yes sir, here it is.
A hole in her starboard side, sir.
This report reached your office hours ago.
Why haven't I seen it?
Well, I have had the details for the committees visit on my hands, sir.
I knew you'd want that run off shipshape.
I've arranged to meet them at the airport, take them to the hotel, and interview with the press...
We're not celebrating
Old Home Week, Masterman.
Those men are coming here to try to get fighting ships back to sea again in the least possible time.
Maybe you believe, like a lot of other people, that we can fight this year's war with next year's ships.
- No sir. - See that the yard manager's office gets this at once.
It gives the repairs to the
Crenshaw a high priority.
- Yes sir. - No wonder I have wild eyed officers barging in on me,
- unannounced.
- I'm sorry about that, sir.
- Won't happen again.
- Right.
It was rather a raw trick to play on Roberts, at that.
Taking him off a brand new spic and span destroyer leader and transferring him to a ship like the Warren.
Not that old Noah's Ark, sir.
Yes.
Having him march in like that just when
I needed a new skipper for the Warren was a great a stroke of luck.
Roberts knows those old force trackers from stem to stern and truck to keel.
Couldn't have found a better man.
- Congratulations, sir. - Seeing as he'll have has hands full,
I want to find him a crack executive officer.
Yes, sir. Whom do you suggest we condemn to the galleys?
Hm?
Sit down, Masterman.
Thank you, sir.
You youngsters of the new Navy don't think much of officers like Roberts.
- Do you? - Well, to be truthful sir,
I haven't thought of him at all.
I can understand why.
Take you, for example.
You were given the privilege of a top drawer Harvard education, with everything that family and position could offer.
Like any good solid American, you took full advantage of it.
That shows in your examination for the Naval service, and in your service record since you've been in the Navy.
That's why you've moved ahead so fast.
- I've tried to do my best, sir.
- Of course you have.
Wouldn't expect anything else of you.
But Roberts did it the hard way.
He enlisted during the last war.
Must've been as young as we take 'em.
Maybe a little younger.
His father was a farmer, he had no family to help him, and no traditions.
He fought his way up.
Masterman, you've never had to fight very hard for anything.
You've missed a lot of fun...
And a lot of Navy, the real Navy that doesn't float on salt water, but in a man's blood stream.
A man that goes to sea as the
Warren's executive officer, will be lucky.
He can learn a lot from a skipper like Roberts.
Well, I'm sure of that, sir.
As for me, I've already learned a lot serving under you, sir.
Yes, yes... I've noticed.
Your lumbago, sir?
Mr. Masterman, an occasional stitch in the back is not lumbago.
- No sir. - And I'll thank you not to mention that where it might be misinterpreted by some long nosed sawbones.
I still have dreams of sea duty.
Yes sir, I'll be very careful, sir.
Well, what are you standing there for?
Do you realize you've wasted
10 minutes of my time?
Get those repair orders to the yard manager's office.
And don't forget that we're going to give Roberts a crack executive officer.
Oh yes, sir. I'll draw up a list of officers available for the duty, sir.
And don't start with oysters!
- Here you are.
- Oh, how nice.
- May I get you anything else?
- Oh no, Lieutenant.
- Thank you so much.
- Senator?
No thank you.
Excuse me.
Sorry to let all this music go to waste.
You seem to have the senatorial party well in hand...
Along with everything else.
Oh, senators are really quite easy to handle.
You just remember they're human, like everybody else, and then remember not to treat them that way.
Um, now that we're alone, can you give me one good reason why I should forsake my duties as a naval officer, and accept your weekend invitation?
Well, you meet a lot of lovely people and the food's not bad.
Well, I'm on a diet.
Besides, I want to be alone.
Hm... there's a lovely golf course.
A gorgeous swimming pool?
Oh, and a super tennis court.
Oh, please, don't mention exercise. I cultivate my muscles all week long.
Come Saturday and Sunday, I just want to cuddle down some place with a good book.
I beg your pardon, sir.
A message from Lieutenant Commander
Roberts. It's marked urgent.
Roberts? Oh... oh yes, Roberts.
Excuse me.
- Is there an answer, sir?
- No, no answer.
Serious?
No, nothing serious.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Admiral Thomas, may
I present Miss Carr.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- And my uncle, Senator Masterman.
- How do you do?
Well, what are you grinning about?
It's very funny, sir.
It seems that Mr. Roberts new command has gone to his head.
"Dear Masterman, I should like to see you aboard the Warren immediately. Relative to the ship's business. Signed, Roberts. "
What's funny about a captain wanting to discuss matters with his executive officer?
I, I beg your pardon, sir?
We agreed that the Warren needed a crack exec.
Yes sir, I submitted a list of the names of the officers...
I appreciate your modesty, my boy, leaving your own name off the list.
But I added it to the top and notified Roberts.
I meant to congratulate you on your new duty, but the Senate Naval Affairs
Committee, you understand.
- Oh, happy cruise, Masterman.
- Thank you, sir.
My dear lady, please allow me to present you with these lazy loops, in lieu of our literary weekend.
Attention on deck!
Captain's coming aboard.
Good evening.
Welcome aboard, sir.
I'm sorry I couldn't pipe the
Captain aboard the sideboy, sir.
Thank you.
Doesn't seem to be anybody aboard.
Oh, no sir. Nobody but me.
I called attention through force of habit, sir.
Who are you?
Chief Yeoman Henry Johnson, sir.
How long have you been aboard?
Twenty-six years, sir.
- Twenty-six years?
- Yes, sir.
I came aboard when she was first fitted out and commissioned.
That was 1916, sir.
We've been together ever since.
But she's been out of commission.
Yes, sir. I went out of commission with her.
The Navy department laid us both up together, sir.
You stayed aboard all this time?
It wasn't long, sir.
And I felt more at home here than
I would've on the beach, sir.
Oh, I should've said, ex-Chief Yeoman, sir.
I've been a civilian caretaker.
Oh.
But, we, well...
She and I sort of pretended... things hadn't changed any, sir.
Lieutenant Masterman been aboard?
No sir. Your the first of the new officers, sir.
Ask him to step down to wardroom, if you will.
- Yes, sir.
- Good night, Johnson.
Good night, sir.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.
So, this is the USS Warren, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- She's a mess, isn't she?
Well, sir, right now, she's a little like the lady that was waked out of her sound sleep in the middle of the night with a face full of cold cream and her hair done up in curlers.
But you give her a chance to get prettied up, sir, and she'll give those new destroyers cards and spades in any beauty contest.
Oh, I can see that she's a Follies Beauty all right.
Follies of 1902.
Has the skipper come on board yet?
Yes, sir.
His compliments, sir.
And would you step down to the wardroom.
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Masterman.
Come in.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.
Glad to have you aboard.
Sit down.
Cheery, isn't it?
When's the funeral?
Don't worry, you won't find anything scary under the seat covers.
I've looked.
Oh, I met the ancient mariner at the head of the gangway.
Oh, you mean, ex-Chief Yeoman Johnson?
He's quite a character.
Mr. Masterman, I want you to see that the storage light comes alongside first thing in the morning.
Have the remainder of our storage put aboard and stowed.
- Yes sir.
- When that's shipshape, see that the fuel barge comes alongside.
- You'll have to pick us a crew.
- Aye, sir.
They may be scarce, but pick as many experienced destroyer men as you can find.
- Aye, sir. - Oh yes, the torpedo compliment.
Have them put aboard.
Shall I also check the bows and arrows, sir?
Mr. Masterman?
Aboard a destroyer, the executive officer has got to be a jack of all trades.
I'm a jack, all right.
Begging the Captain's pardon, I brewed up a little java for the wardroom, sir.
- It smells good.
- Yes, sir.
Nothing like the smell of fresh coffee to put life in ship.
Thank you, Johnson. Good of you to go through the trouble.
- Thank you.
- No trouble, sir.
I have a little galley rigged up topside.
There's something just outside the door I'd like to show you.
- Cream or sugar, Masterman?
- No, black thanks.
Here it is, sir.
I guess you're the proper person to be having to carry this now, sir.
That's a plaque.
It was put aboard after the last war.
Orders of the Secretary of the Navy.
Like a medal of honor.
"USS Warren served in the World War... "
"April 6, 1917 to November 11, 1918.
Sea patrol, 1917 to 1918.
Captured the U, 109.
March 11, 1918.
Sunk the U, 141.
August 3, 1918.
Participated in destroyer action,
September 9, 1918."
That's where I got this... shell fragment.
"Carried the Assistant Secretary of the
Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt to Europe.
July, 1918.
Was present at the surrender of the enemy fleet at...
Scapa Flow. "
That's all, sir.
You'll find the screw holds for it, sir, on the after stack.
I took it down for safe keeping.
Kept it from getting tarnished.
- All these years?
- Yes sir.
Thank you, Johnson.
We'll see that it goes back where it belongs.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Begging the
Captain's pardon, sir.
I'd like to ship over for another cruise.
- Ship over?
- Yes sir.
Johnson, that's a fine spirit.
I'm sure there's a job you can do somewhere around the Navy.
- Yes, sir. - You know, destroyer service is a young man's game.
It's too tough for grey hairs.
I guess, maybe you're right, sir.
Well, good luck, sir.
I know the Warren will take you where you're going, and bring you back.
- Good night, sir.
- Johnson?
- Yes, sir. - Mr. Masterman and
I'll take good care of your ship.
Won't we, Masterman?
Oh yes, we'll bring her back with ribbons in her hair.
I know you will, sir.
She's a proud thing.
Slipping along with the green seas rolling under her foot.
She's pretty as a picture.
Well...
Good night, sir.
- Well? - That kind of man built the Navy.
Why don't you stretch your point and take him on?
To board a destroyer, a man needs more arms and legs than a centipede.
But you can't leave him on the beach in these times.
You can't run a navy on sentiment, Mr. Masterson.
I'll remember that, sir.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Yes, Johnson?
You'll be taking the Warren to sea soon now, I suppose.
- I imagine so. - She's a wonderful ship on the helm, sir.
Takes it like a thoroughbred.
I know her well.
I went to sea on her first as a quartermaster.
But you'll find, sir, that when you're turning her on the heel into the wind, you've got to give her a little headway to keep her from falling off.
- She likes to be coaxed. - Thanks
Johnson, I'll remember that.
And the throttle valve on the starboard engine, sir...
Creeps now and then, towards open.
It never was exactly right.
It's too bad you're not making this cruise, Johnson.
The captain knows best, sir.
Well, I suppose things have changed a lot since you went
- on the inactive list.
- Oh, that they have, sir.
But all the time the Warren and
I were tied up in San Diego,
I went to the school at the base three nights a week.
It kept me up on things.
Just how old are you, Johnson?
Oh, I'm coming on 40, you might say, sir.
Let's see, that'd make you just past 14 when you were on the North Sea patrol.
Yes sir, but I was a very big lad for my age.
Uh-huh.
You'd be a great help to the executive officer of the Warren, knowing her as you do.
I'd give anything to be going with you, sir.
Grey hair makes a man look a lot older than he really is, you know?
Without that, you'd look 20 years younger.
It'd make a different man of you.
Well, good night, Johnson.
Good night, sir.
Attention on deck, captain coming aboard!
Officer's hands salute!
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Morning, sir.
- Hello Tim, glad to see you aboard.
- Thank you, sir.
- How's everything in the engine room?
- Everything's shipshape.
Lieutenant Royce, gunnery... Royce?
- How do you do, sir?
- Lieutenant Martin, torpedo.
- Martin?
- How do you do, sir?
- Ensign Lindsay, sir.
- Lindsay?
- First cruise, huh?
- Yes, sir.
I just came aboard last night, sir.
Think you'll like destroyer duty?
Yes sir, it's wonderful, sir.
Crew are ready for inspection, sir.
Very well.
- Chief Signalman Jones.
- Morning sir.
Morning.
Chief Boatswain's
Mate Jenks, sir.
Jenks, glad to see you aboard.
Thank you, sir.
Right glad to be aboard, sir.
Chief Quartermaster Rankin.
- Rankin, glad to see you aboard.
- Thank you, sir.
Chief Yeoman Johnson, sir.
Johnson... You?
Yes sir, me.
How did you get aboard.
I applied for re-enlistment on the
Warren, sir, in my old ranking and...
...and was accepted, sir.
With the help of
Mr. Masterman, sir.
Mr. Masterman?
You didn't, by any chance, suggest that Johnson dye his hair, did you?
Your orders were to get experienced men, sir.
And you can't run a navy on sentiment.
Hm.
Congratulations.
Very becoming.
Thank you, sir.
"By authority of the
Secretary of the Navy, contained in order of May the 21st, 1942,
I hereby re-commission the USS Warren in the naval service of the United States and deliver her to her commanding officer. "
USS Warren is placed in commission and is delivered to you, sir.
I accept command, sir.
Divisions right and left, face!
Sound off.
Divisions right and left, face!
Mr. Masterman, set the watch.
Aye aye, sir. Set the watch, first section!
Aye aye, sir.
Set the watch!
First section!
Set the watch, first section.
Set the watch, first section.
Officers and men, your ship, the Warren, is now commissioned by the United
States to fight our enemies.
You make up it's crew.
Regulars, reservists, recruits... as you pull together, as you become a smoothly functioning machine, as through your spirit, you make this ship live... so will our country live.
For the time, we must fight this generation's war partly with last generation ships.
The Warren is old, called back out of its honorable retirement to fight again, but it is a glorious ship with a great history.
There was another old ship in the United States Navy, practically falling apart.
She fought in action with a brand new, blue ribbon frigate.
When she was shot to pieces, on fire, dismasted, the captain of the enemy frigate hailed her, to ask if she had struck her colors.
Her answer to that question has been the number one watchword of the American Navy for a 150 years.
You may remember her name... the Bonhomme Richard.
Captain John Paul Jones, a farmer's son, commanding.
Her answer was,
"I have not yet begun to fight. "
Request permission to leave the ship, sir.
Permission granted, sir.
- Happy cruise, Roberts.
- Thank you, sir.
- Happy cruise, Masterman.
- Thank you, sir.
Salute.
Clear the side.
Leave to quarters.
The old man thinks so much of the Bonhomme Richard, it's a wonder he didn't send us out to sea on her.
You don't think so much of the Warren, do you?
Frankly, no sir. And I have the feeling that you don't either.
Mr. Masterman, to me,
John Paul Jones is the greatest hero in naval history.
Yes, sir.
Perhaps he didn't think so much of the Bonhomme Richard.
But she was his ship.
The Warren is your ship.
You're her executive officer and navigator.
Yes sir.
When this shakedown cruise is over, perhaps you can get yourself duty that will be more to your liking.
For now, prepare to get underway at 1100.
Aye aye, sir.
Tell the engineering officer to light off his other two boilers as soon as
- we're through the gates.
- Yes, sir.
Now we're bearing two-four-six.
Mr. Masterman, if you must smoke the pipe, would you mind standing the lower, hereafter?
Oh, sorry, sir.
Noon, sir. Mark.
Seventy-nine degrees.
Thirty-two minutes.
Ten seconds.
You know, Masterman, you're a pretty good navigator.
Thank you, sir.
This is a lot different then that chromium-plated luxury-laden racing barge of yours, isn't it?
Well, the accommodations were much better.
One always had that comforting feeling that she'd hold together in a blow.
- Masterman.
- Yes, sir?
As soon as the sky's clear, we'll have anti-aircraft drill.
We've had one every day since we've been out.
We'll still have anti-aircraft drill, Mr. Masterman.
Aye aye, sir.
Ammunition ready?
Release number one!
- Release number one!
- Aye aye, sir.
Use 2.0, range 7-5-0, scale 1-0-1.
- Use, set!
- Set!
Load!
- Ready!
- On target.
Commence firing!
Release number two!
Release number three!
Use 2.2, range 8-5-0, scale 1-0-4.
- Use, set!
- Set
- Ready!
- On target!
Resume fire!
Use 2.5, range 1-0-0, scale 1-0-5.
- Use, set!
- Set!
- Ready!
- On target!
Resume fire!
- Nice shooting, sir.
- Fine.
Cease fire and secure.
- Cease firing and secure.
- Aye aye.
- Use 2.8... - Captain says cease firing and secure the batteries, sir.
- Cease firing and secure.
- Aye...
Nice work, men.
Come in, Masterman.
Battery's secured, sir. Three rounds expended, no casualties.
Very well. Sit down.
Thanks, sir.
Smoke?
No thanks, sir.
But...
Oh...
You know, the drill went much smoother today, Masterman.
- Nice shooting.
- Not very exciting, sir.
Like shooting clay pigeons.
It doesn't get exciting until the clay pigeons start shooting back at you.
The sooner the better, sir.
If it happens,
I think we'll be ready.
You know, we've accomplished a lot the past two weeks.
The Warren's beginning to shake down now.
She's becoming a war ship.
You couldn't want a better crew.
You're being a little optimistic, sir.
Mr. Masterman, there've been a couple of times when I thought I detected a slight flaw in your schooling.
If you mean I'm not a graduate of the
"Pollyanna" school, you're right.
I don't know what they taught you at Harvard, but the Navy teaches a man to do the best possible job with whatever tools are at hand.
I suppose that's from
John Paul Jones too, sir.
No, that's from
Martin J. Roberts.
Yes sir.
- Come in.
- I beg your pardon, sir, but the radio operator just picked up this message.
"SOS from SS Lancaster to all ships.
Being shelled by enemy submarines, position latitude 27'45 North.
Longitude 140'36 West. "
Mr. Masterman, this is no longer a shakedown cruise.
Plot this position. Give me the course and distance to the Lancaster.
Johnson? Tell the engineering officer to light off his other two boilers.
- Prepare for full power.
- Aye aye, sir.
There's a glow in the horizon.
Two points in the starboard bow.
Looks like a fire, sir.
Nothing but burning oil on the water.
Guess that's all that's left of the Lancaster.
- Shall we stop the engine, sir?
- Stop the engine?
Mr. Masterman, the sub that sank the Lancaster is out there somewhere right now, waiting. For us.
The Warren at a standstill silhouetted against that glare
- would be a perfect target.
- Yes, sir.
Come left 10 degrees of course, we'll search the area for survivors.
Aye aye, sir.
Yes, Mr. Secretary.
No, Mr. Secretary.
Yes, Mr. Secretary.
No, Mr. Secretary.
Goodbye, Mr. Secretary.
That's what I like about the telephone.
It gives a man a chance to express himself.
- Yes, sir.
- See that those orders are carried out immediately.
Yes sir.
Well Dudley, what is it?
Message from the
Chief of Operations, sir.
- Read it.
- Yes sir.
"You are relieved of your duties as
Commandant of the Navy Yard of this state. "
- What? - "And are directed to proceed to Pearl Harbor immediately to assume command of
East Bound Convoy.
Now assembled in Honolulu. "
- Read that again.
- Yes, sir.
- You are...
- No, no, no. I'll read it.
"You are relieved of your duties as Commandant... "
Cruise to
Chattanooga as flagship.
- Active service.
- Yes sir.
Dudley, how long would it take us to get on our way?
There's a PBY plane leaving at 4:00, sir.
Good, gives us just about time to get ready.
Ha! Not much like my first command!
Took me three months to get to my ship.
Things move much faster in this day and age.
Get a hold of the sea at noon one day, sitting on a PBY at four the same afternoon.
Arrive at Honolulu the next morning at seven...
Before you can say "Jack Robbin" I'm pacing the bridge of my flagship.
- And headed right back for the mainland, sir. - What?
Well, at any rate,
I'll be at sea.
Yes, sir.
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.
Morning Ludlow,
Morning Dr. Stone.
Fine day, great sailing weather.
Yes, sir.
How are you feeling, sir?
Never felt better in my life.
Salt air and sea, that's all a man needs.
- Yes sir.
- Smart ship, the Chattanooga.
Proud to have her as my flagship.
Thank you, sir. It's a great pleasure to serve with you.
- What is it Dudley? - Just received this visual message from our right flank destroyer, sir, the Murray.
Breakdown in steering gear, makes maneuvering impossible.
Cannot effect repairs at sea.
Request instructions.
That's a fine thing.
The sun is shining, everyone is happy.
And the Murray has a steering casualty.
Serious, sir. Leaves the right flank unprotected.
Signal the Murray to return to Pearl Harbor, and request the base to send the nearest destroyer available.
Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Martin's instructions were to show you this at once. It's very important.
Thank you.
Well, looks like this is it.
Priority from the base.
We're ordered to join an East
Bound convoy at noon tomorrow.
Latitude, 23'30 North.
Longitude, 143'20 West.
Gentlemen, it looks like we're in it.
How far do you make it,
Masterman?
- About 600 miles, sir.
- Six hundred miles?
That means we'll have to do 25 knots for 24 hours.
- And what about fuel? - Let's think about getting there.
- Come on, Tim. Back to the mines.
- Yes sir.
I don't know how to break the news to those poor old sputtering engines.
Check that position, put her on the course to the rendezvous, Mr. Masterman.
It's a pretty long haul, sir, at 25 knots...
- In this sea. - We'll make it.
- We've got to make it.
That's an order you've got in your hand.
Well, I wish the guy that sent it were here.
This is more like it, sir.
Action.
If the bailing wire that holds our engines together don't give way under the strain.
Oh, don't you worry, sir.
She can take it.
These are no better than that.
Signal the Glengow to stop making smoke.
Aye aye, sir.
It's like standing watch over a flock of chickens knowing that a weasel is loose in the barnyard.
The Warren will join us at noon tomorrow, sir.
- That flank will be covered.
- The Warren.
With all the modern destroyers in the United States Navy,
- I get the Warren. - I thought you put her in commission yourself, sir.
Hm? For coast patrol, yes.
She could've done that well enough.
To protect a convoys flank?
The Warren.
Aircraft sighted on the port water, sir.
Bearing 225 degrees relative.
He's crossing to starboard.
Can't make out her marking, sir.
She's none of ours.
Wrong silhouette.
- Mr. Lindsay?
- Yes, sir.
Sound general quarters, come right 30 degrees to course,
- one mast the battery.
- Aye aye, sir.
Masterman, here's a different kind of clay pigeon for ya.
- Good hunting.
- Stand by for action!
Load, hurry up, load!
Range, 1-9-0-0.
Scale, 9-7.
Commence firing!
What's the matter?
Those shells aren't bursting!
What's the matter with
Masterman, anyway?
Range, 1-0-0-0.
Scale, 9-4.
Barrage fire.
Commence firing!
Aft to deck!
Aft to deck!
Can't read them, sir.
I'm going in.
Mr. Lindsay, take over.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Look out! Here it comes!
Rapid fire! Commence firing!
Coming around for another try at us!
- Right at target!
- Masterman! Masterman...
For the love of Mike, you're forgetting to cut your fuses.
Duck!
Stop firing!
We won't get another shot at that bird.
He's on his way back to his perch.
Have the gun crew stand by just in case.
Aye aye, sir.
Johnson, have the communications officer encode and dispatch this message to the base.
Yes, sir.
Attacked and bombed by enemy catapult-type reconnaissance airplane.
Ask the navigator to add our position.
Yes, sir.
Wish I could add aircraft destroyed by gun fire.
So do I, sir.
Why don't you tell him it was my fault it got away.
- That's all, Johnson.
- Yes, sir.
Come in, Masterman.
It was nice of you, sir, sparing my feelings.
What?
You've downed that Jap and covered ourselves with glory if I hadn't developed a case of the galloping jitters.
That's what you've been waiting to tell me, isn't it?
Not at all. Sit down.
For anti-aircraft defense we also have some machine guns aboard.
- They miss, too.
- I know who's fault it was.
- Mine. I bungled the job.
- Masterman.
A man's first action is a lot like going into his first football game.
He can be letter perfect in practice, but when he gets out on the field, face to face with the real thing, he'll be liable to get a little over anxious.
Might even develop a case of the galloping jitters, as you call them.
But after he's been bounced around a couple of times, good and hard, he usually steadies down.
Thanks for the pep talk, sir.
But we aren't playing games.
Maybe John Paul Jones or the Navy teaches differently.
Harvard teaches a man to stand on his two feet, and accept the responsibility for his own mistakes.
Aboard ship, the only man that can accept responsibility for a mistake is her captain.
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Rough log and reports to check, sir.
Thanks.
Did I ever tell you, sir, why I don't like fish?
What?
It's quite a story, sir.
See, when I was a lad about 10, my father took me fishing.
And along about noon,
I began to get hungry.
And my father was taking a nap, so I stuck both fish poles in the riverbank, and got me a sandwich out of the basket.
Well, sir, I no sooner picked up that sandwich, then the cork on one line began to bob up and down like mad.
So I belayed everything and hauled away.
And I hooked me a beauty.
I was standing there admiring the fish.
When, so help me, the cork on the other line began to jump up and down.
Well, there I was, sir.
A sandwich in this hand, and a live fish in this hand.
Well, I got kind of mixed up in my hands.
And instead of putting a sandwich in my mouth, I put the fish in.
And I've never liked fish since.
It's funny what a man will do in a moment of excitement, sir.
Thanks, Johnson.
I see what you mean.
Thank you, sir.
No offense.
It's a lovely night, isn't it, sir?
You look a little green around the gills, Lindsay. Why don't you go below?
I was below, sir, but...
I just came topside for a breath of air.
You'll be all right, sir.
I'm glad you think so.
Our eight o'clock position, sir.
Dead reckoning.
Too overcast for star sights.
- Bridge.
- Starboard life raft,
- adrift on deck.
- Aye aye, Jenks.
Chief Paulson's made a report, starboard life raft adrift on deck, sir.
Take care of it, will ya, Masterman?
Aye aye, sir.
- I'll go with ya, sir.
- All right, Johnson.
Be careful, sir!
She's pretty rough!
Better use the safety line, sir.
Be careful, sir!
That was a close one, Johnson!
- You all right, sir?
- I'm all right.
Johnson! Johnson!
- Is he bad, Miller?
- Pretty bad, sir.
I know he has a concussion, maybe a skull fracture.
But, he has a chance.
At his age, a man doesn't rally like a 20 year old, sir.
I'm afraid he can't stand this pounding, sir.
If we were in still water, or if we could reduce speed...
- Do everything possible.
- Yes, sir.
- Got plugged.
- Yeah.
He kept me from going overboard.
I feel like it was my fault.
Forget it.
Any man aboard would've done the same thing.
I'm woozy on my feet.
Think I'll turn in and catch 40 winks.
Keep driving her, Masterman.
But Doc said that Johnson couldn't take this pounding.
I'm afraid he'll have to take it.
Don't call me unless it's necessary.
Good...
...ship...
Hundred line...
- What's he saying? - He's been talking about his ship.
This ship, sir.
Johnson...
Johnson?
I hear ya, sir.
Coming right up.
If you're going on watch, sir, better wear your shammy and leather coat.
Shammy and leather?
I haven't got one.
The one you took from the skipper of the U109 when we captured it.
You'll be needing it, sir.
There's a smell of ice in the air.
Thanks Johnson for reminding me about the coat.
If we could only slow down, sir.
It might make him rest easier.
Force, 3-1-5!
Checking 3-0-2 magnetic.
Standard speed 25, 277 turn.
Steaming the boilers, one and two.
Maintain present course and speed throughout the night.
Check with the next fray, second section.
I relieve you, sir. Good night.
Reduce speed to 1/3rd,
Mr. Martin.
But the orders are to maintain standard speed, sir.
I accept the responsibility for changing those orders.
Aye aye, sir.
- Quartermaster?
- Aye.
Notify the captain that I've reduced the speed to 1/3rd on the advice of the navigator.
- Aye, sir.
- Belay that, Quartermaster.
Captain's orders were not to disturb him unless I considered it necessary.
Ship's office,
Pharmacist Mate Miller.
That better, Miller?
Well, yes sir, Mr. Masterman.
Much better.
- He's resting a lot easier.
- Good.
Mr. Martin, my orders were to maintain a speed of 25 knots through the night.
Yes, sir.
I changed those orders, sir.
I hope you have a satisfactory explanation, Mr. Masterman.
I have a very satisfactory explanation, sir.
Chief Yeoman Johnson's lying below badly hurt.
I was aware of that fact when I gave the orders.
Your counter-manning them has cost us precious time.
Life of a man like Johnson should be worth some of the Navy's time, no matter how precious.
If that's sentiment, sir, I'm willing to have the most made of it.
You seem to be forgetting that the convoy we're joining is carrying hundreds of women and children and wounded men, who may be at the mercy of the enemy.
Risking the life of any one man must be subordinated to risking the lives of many.
Resume standard speed, Mr. Martin.
Aye aye, sir.
When you achieve command,
Mr. Masterman, you'll find that it'll be necessary to make many decisions that will be personally unpleasant for you.
You'll also find it necessary to carry out an order, come hell or high water.
All right, Johnson.
It's all right, old man.
Easy now.
Steady, Johnson.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Masterman.
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.
- Oh, morning, Chief.
The next guy that calls this ship a romantic old tub with tea kettle engines, will have me and the black gang to lay.
Boy can she take it.
Listen to her.
Tickin' like a watch and purring like a kitten.
- Keep her tickin', Chief.
- Aye aye, sir.
Good old, girl.
Too bad the man on board who knew she could take it can't hear us congratulating ourselves.
What? Oh, Johnson.
Well, he took it all right. In fact, he's much better this morning.
There's a floating object, one point off the port bow, sir.
Looks like a life boat, sir.
It is a life boat.
There might be survivors, sir.
It might be a Jap hiding his periscope behind that.
- Mr. Lindsay.
- Yes, sir.
- Circle it at full speed.
- Aye aye, sir.
Survivors, all right.
Mr. Masterman, stop all engines.
Stop all engines, sir?
Yes, Mr. Masterman.
This is the exception that always proves the rule.
There's a man in that boat that looks pretty well used up.
Yes sir.
- Stop all engines, Mr. Lindsay.
- Stop all engines, sir.
There's another man in the bow.
Mr. Lindsay, all engines back one!
All engines back one, sir.
Stand by on deck to receive life boat on port side.
All right, men!
Barrel hand!
- See your bow line!
- Heads up!
Over the sides, men.
Come on, Davis.
Make it fast!
Give the stern line!
Make fast the stern line!
Step lively down there.
Get 'em aboard and cast that boat adrift.
All right, lads.
Bring them up.
All right, give 'em a hand.
- Steady, lad.
- There ya go, fella.
Heave!
Under the tarpaulin...
He says there's something under the tarpaulin!
Hey look! Hey Chief, look!
Holy mackerel!
Come on, Jenks!
Show some life!
What's going on down there?
I don't know, sir.
Looks like we made a haul!
Women... and a whole school of babies!
- Babies?!
- Yes sir.
Kids, sir. Minnow sized.
This is impossible!
What are we going to do with babies?
Well, if they're that small, you can throw them back in.
Save time.
- All right, bring 'em aboard.
- Aye aye, sir!
Come on, lift the women folks up here.
Barrel hands, boys.
You're all right, lady.
Hand those children up here!
Easy going, you big old nursemaid, you!
- Congratulations, sir.
- What?
Old lady Warren seems to have become a mother very late in life.
- It's amazing. - Women and children aboard a destroyer.
Looks like we've got quite a job ahead of us.
Oh, I'm sure you'll do the best possible job with whatever tools are at hand.
- What?
- Sir?
Oh yes, you're quite right.
And I know just the man for the job of looking after them.
- You.
- Me?
I seem to recall how beautifully you took care of social affairs for the Admiral.
- Wait a minute...
- Mr. Masterman, that's an order.
Come hell or high water, remember?
And you'll probably run into both on this assignment.
Resume standard speed,
Mr. Martin.
Aye aye, sir.
All present and accounted for, sir.
Call the men to attention.
Attention!
Mr. Masterman, I figure we could stow the babies here in the crews compartments.
And I mustered all hands who are off watch to kind of look after 'em.
Them women folk look mighty pinched to me, sir.
Especially that one.
Looks like we'll have to organize things to take care of the situation.
Attention men.
All married men with children, one pace forward.
The remainder, at ease.
All in line down here.
Well, here's your nursery detail, Jenks.
All right, sir.
Well, these youngster can stand this, they'll live through anything.
You're sure an angelic looking bunch of papas.
Looks like some of you men will have to take care of more than one baby.
Put all the little ladies on the port side, and all the little gentlemen on the starboard.
Fall out. All you men who don't have babies, take one of these.
Careful now.
Restore on of the bunks and rig nettings around 'em, so they don't tumble out.
- Yes sir. - Tell the cook to make up some warm milk.
They'll quiet down once they have some chow.
Oh, thank you very much, Lieutenant.
You'd make a wonderful foster father.
Aren't you a little young to be the mother of such a large family?
You're much too exhausted to be playing nurse.
She's... pretty bad.
You'll both be quite all right.
I'll have some of the officers double up, so you ladies can use their rooms.
I've heard of three men in a boat, but two women and
20 babies, beats me.
Poor children.
They're evacuees from the maternity hospital in Honolulu on their way to the mainland.
Ah...
Our ship was separated from the convoy.
- They got us at night.
- Don't think about it.
You're perfectly safe now.
Is there a doctor on board?
No, I'm sorry. Only a pharmacist's mate.
- Yes, but...
- Don't worry.
- We'll take good care of you.
- Don't go.
Don't leave me.
I can't leave.
She needs help desperately.
Afraid I must insist. You're practically out on your feet yourself.
I'll see that your friend's moved at once.
Oh, Rankin, take the other lady to Mr. Martin's room.
Aye aye, sir.
You've been through a pretty nasty experience, Miss...
- Miss...
- Missus.
- Oh.
- Mrs. Steve Collins.
My husband is a flyer on an aircraft carrier somewhere in the Pacific.
Well, in that case, you'll feel right at home aboard ship.
- How is he?
- Better, sir.
He's sleeping now, but his mind was still wandering.
Still fighting the other war, huh?
Yes, sir.
Well, you'd better come take a look at the ladies we just picked up.
They're both in pretty bad shape.
Yes, sir.
They're in Mr. Martin's and Mr. Royce's rooms.
Yes, sir.
Masterman, I've been hearing glowing reports on your proficiency in the care and feeding of infants.
- Very gratifying.
- Thank you, sir.
It's too bad that you and these other gentlemen are strangers to the soft caress of a babies hand, the magic of a dimpled smile, the charm of triangular trousers.
You have no idea what you're missing.
Excuse me, sir.
She's having a baby!
What?! Who?
The woman we took aboard, sir.
- There were two women.
- One of them's having a baby.
The one in Mr. Martin's room.
Miller, you can't permit such a thing to happen aboard this ship!
It's strictly against regulations.
Well, perhaps if you read Navy
Regulations to the lady, Miller...
I don't think there's time, sir.
And besides, I'm only a Pharmacist's Mate!
Query, sir. John Paul Jones must've had something to say concerning a moment like this.
You don't remember what it was...
- Mr. Masterman?
- Yes, sir.
Now, wait a minute, sir. I'm a ship's officer, not a stork!
That's right, you're the executive officer.
I don't know what John
Paul Jones might've said, but Navy Regulations say that all matters pertaining to the ship's company properly fall under the jurisdiction of the executive officer.
The lady, through force of circumstance, is technically a member of the ship's company.
Execute, Mr. Masterman. Execute.
Men...
Uh... Your attention.
Naturally, this somewhat unusual duty... situation... is a great shock to all of us.
But as good sailors, we must see it through for the honor of the old ship.
Now, all of you men have had babies of your own.
Did you ever lend a hand when the happy event was taking place?
Mr. Masterman, Mr. Masterman!
The Lieutenant, pardon sir, the Pharmacist's Mate... he wants to see you right away!
It's that lady, she's...
All right, all right...
Dismissed, back to your kindergarten.
Men...
I got an idea, sir.
- Mr. Masterman!
- Yes, yes...
Mr. Masterman, please.
She needs help right away!
I'm sorry, I can't do anymore.
All right, I'll go back!
Jenks! Jenks!
Here sir, we're going to do this shipshape and sharp.
Just like a hospital, sir.
It's the Carpenter's Mate, sir.
He'd like a word with you.
Don't tell me he's gonna have a baby, too.
- Come on in, Chips.
- Thank you, sir.
It's something I wouldn't care to admit in front of the others, sir.
Well, my wife is a visiting nurse, and I have stood by on a occasions like this, and I don't claim to be no expert sir,
I had a chance to sort of memorize the specifications as it were.
Chip, you're just what we're looking for.
But this is very informal Mr. Masterman.
Don't forget I'm a total stranger to the lady.
Don't worry, Chips.
I'll introduce you later.
Take it easy, Lindsay. After all, you're not the father.
I know, sir.
But I'm still nervous.
You know, Mr. Masterman, this is an awful lesson for me.
Once or twice I've thought about getting myself obliged.
No more.
Uh-uh. Not after this.
Shh!
- Well? - I wish the report the presence of a stowaway, sir.
I should say about six and a half pounds.
Chips, for bravery you deserve a medal.
I'll settle for a cup of coffee, sir.
That you'll have.
Well, the launching's complete, sir.
Mother and baby are in perfect shape.
It's a boy.
Well, I'm glad that's over.
- Well done, Masterman. - Strictly according to regulation, sir.
- Jenks, what is it?
- Pardon, Captain, sir.
We're a delegation from the crew.
- About what? - Well, it's about a name for the new craft, sir.
Warren is a fine name for a boy, sir.
Bridge?
Convoy sighted on starboard bow!
Looks like about a
30 ship convoy, sir.
The cruiser leading is the Chattanooga.
I forgot to tell you the
Admiral aboard that cruiser
- is Steven Thomas, USN.
- Old Iron Pants?
Finally got his wish.
- I wonder how his lumbago is.
- We'll find out.
We're an hour late arriving at rendezvous.
The Warren's just been sighted two points on the starboard bow, sir.
- I've got eyes, Dudley.
- Yes, sir.
Signal her to take position on convoy's starboard flank
- and patrol station.
- Aye aye, sir.
Then ask her to explain why she's an hour late in keeping rendezvous.
Aye aye, sir.
Orders from the flagship, sir.
"Take position at the starboard flank with convoy and patrol station. "
- Carry out those orders, will ya, Masterman? - Aye aye, sir.
Second message from flagship, sir.
"Explain one hour delay in keeping rendezvous. "
Signal answer, regret delay due to misinterpretation of orders.
Aye aye, sir.
Warren reports delay due to misinterpretation of orders.
Misinterpretation?
What kind of an answer is that?
Tell the Warren I want the signal number of the officer responsible for misinterpretation of orders.
Aye aye, sir.
From the flagship, sir. "Report immediately signal number of the officer responsible for misinterpretation or orders. "
Place my number, Martin.
Aye aye, sir.
After all, sir, I was to blame for the delay...
Why didn't you hoist my number?
Isn't a question of blame,
Masterman.
The Admiral requested the signal number of the officer responsible.
- That's right. - Aboard ship, the captain's responsible for everything.
- Oh yes. - Good. For a moment I thought it'd slipped your mind.
Warren answered your query with a signal number of commanding officer,
- Lieutenant Commander Roberts.
- Uh huh.
Just what I expected from Roberts. No alibis.
I could always tell a crack officer by the cut of his jib.
And the grace to go, Mr. Lindsay.
- Change standard speed to 15 knots.
- Aye aye, sir.
Attention. Baby Division.
You will lay aft to the afterdeck house.
Sunbathing time for the babies.
Don't you forget, you nursemaids, we're in a convoy so keep those kids out of sight as much as possible.

Hey Jenks, are you sure baking powder's all right to use?
Of course it is.
You use it on bread, don't ya?
Yeah, but these are little babies.
So if it's OK for bread, it's
OK for babies! Spread it on.
Hey Jason, you'd better take in that pair of pants pull up some of that slack.
Hey, give 'em a shot out of that bottom might stimulate 'em a little.
Do you feel better now, sir, now that the Warren's in position?
Yes, yes, oh yes, sir. But do you see what I see on the afterdeck house?
It appears to be a false structure, sir.
Structure? Looks to me like a pigpen.
They must be crazy on the Warren.
First a pigpen, and now a pig.
Right before my eyes.
I can't quite make it out, sir, but it doesn't look...
I know a pig when I see one.
Take a message to the Warren.
Explain presence of unauthorized pigpen and pig running loose on deck.
- Aye aye, sir.
- I'd never have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
Baby Detail! Count your babies!
I got nine!
Hey, wait a minute!
Baby number nine in division three is AWOL.
He was just there a minute ago.
Where'd that scamp go to anyway?
Signal from the flagship, sir.
"Explain presence of unauthorized pigpen and pig running loose on deck. "
Pig?
Jughead? Jughead...
Oh, there you are...
What do you mean running away like that?
I must be crazy.
Not only do they have a pig, but they've made a pet out of it.
Why, they're babies, sir.
Yes, yes, yes...
Well, it looked like a pig.
Dudley, Dudley! Correct previous message to the Warren.
Substitute babies for pig and baby-pen for pigpen.
Aye aye, sir.
Message from the Warren, sir.
From the Warren, sir.
"Have onboard 25 civilian survivors of torpedoed vessel proceeding from Honolulu to San Francisco.
Rescued persons, number two women, twenty babies, and two seamen.
Report one of them... "
Two women,
20 children and two seamen.
- That's 24 survivors.
- The message continues, sir.
"Report, one of the rescued ladies gave birth to a child after being taken aboard. "
Oh...
"In absence of doctor, Carpenter's Mate officiated. Request your concurrence. "
That's the end of the message, sir.
I'm surprised at Roberts.
Permitting such irregularity.
I should've been informed of the entire affair.
It's completely without precedence.
- Boy or girl?
- It doesn't say, sir.
It doesn't say?
What kind of a report is that?
Leaving out the most important detail.
- I'll find out, sir.
- Yes.
- Another message from the Warren, sir.
- Yes, yes, yes.
It's a boy, sir.
Oh. It's a boy.
It's a boy. Well, well, well.
Signal the Warren.
- Well done, Warren.
- Aye aye, sir.
Now take it easy, Johnny.
- Better?
- Oh much better, sir.
- But still... - Hello
Johnson, how're you feeling?
Oh, I'm fit as a fiddle, sir.
Except for a little buzzing in my head.
But nothing to keep a man in his bunk for, sir.
I guess we're entitled to a day off after what we did to that Heinie U-Boat yesterday.
Shot her right through her belly.
I saw her number when she blew up.
Take it easy, Johnson.
Hello Papa. How are all the little children?
- Very funny.
- You look in on Johnson?
Yeah. He's cruising around in the North Sea 25 years ago.
Still thinks
I'm his old skipper.
Mr. Masterman, sir!
I beg your pardon, sir, but the other lady this time, she's about to... she's about to...
- About to what?
- About to have a baby, sir.
Well... Mr. Masterman?
United States Navy.
I'd give a month's pay to see Masterman surrounded by all those babies.
- Masterman? - He's my ex-Junior
Aide, he's quite a fella.
Always made me feel a little uncomfortable.
As if my neck tie weren't on straight or something.
What's the matter with him, sir?
Nothing that a cruise, and the Warren, and a bunch of babies won't cure.
Mr. Dudley to see you sir.
All right.
- Message from the Warren, sir.
- Yes, yes, yes.
"Second lady passenger about to have child.
Request concurrence and medical advice. "
Now look here, Dudley, this sort of thing must stop.
I am fighting a war, not running a lying in hospital.
Aye, sir. Should I transmit that to the Warren, sir?
Certainly not.
Well, Doctor, go on.
Say something.
- Say what?
- You heard the message.
The Warren wants medical advice.
Well, sir, off hand I... I don't know exactly what to say.
Stone, are you or are you not a doctor?
I am a Naval surgeon, sir.
Not a baby specialist.
Now if the woman had only broken her neck, or something more in my line...
Stone, she's having a baby.
The Warren is waiting.
Well, a question like that takes time to answer...
I'll have to refresh my mind.
Look it up!
What shall I tell the Warren, sir?
Tell the Warren to delay everything, my senior surgeon is reading a book.
Aye aye, sir.
- How is she?
- Not very good.
I'm pretty scared.
The other lady had a pretty easy time but...
But Mrs. Collins, this is her first child...
And she's been through a lot.
The torpedo, and the bumping around, the life boat and it's all against her.
But she's got grit, sir.
You think it'd help any if I spoke to her?
Might ease her mind, sir.
Oh...
I'm sorry to be so much trouble, Mr. Masterman.
I'm sorry there isn't more we can do for you, Mrs. Collins.
Why, you're doing everything.
I think you've been wonderful.
If we could only get you aboard the Chattanooga.
She carries a doctor.
Are you scared?
Yes. I'm scared to death.
But I keep thinking of Steve.
My husband.
He's been scared lots of times, but he keeps on fighting.
That's the least I can do.
Well, if it's any help, you've got all hands aboard the Warren fighting with you.
How can I lose?
Yes, sir?
Tell Lieutenant Dudley
I wish to see him.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Yes, sir?
Is there any word from the Warren?
- No sir. - What's the matter with Roberts?
Didn't you signal him to keep us informed?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, signal him again.
Tell him I want to know what progress is being made.
Aye aye, sir.
Well, Doctor? Well?
I have everything organized, sir.
- Well in hand.
- Sit down.
After I ask the Warren a few questions,
- I'll be able to advise.
- What kind of questions?
Well, I'll have to know the lady's age, height, weight, and physical condition.
And I must know if this is her first child
- and whether or... - The Warren makes a simple request for some medical advice and you answer with a demand for a detailed history of the lady's life.
Well, how can I give intelligent instructions if I don't know the case history?
Doctor, a short while ago another baby was born on the Warren with the assistance of a Carpenter's Mate who didn't even know the patient's name.
I remember now when the ship's cat had kittens you lost your head.
That should've warned me.
As I reminded you, sir. I am a naval surgeon aboard a war ship.
War ship or not, a woman is having a baby over on the Warren, and I am having a nervous breakdown!
All right, Joe.
How is she?
Worse.
It's too bad.
After all, sir, Chip's is only the ship's carpenter, and this is a destroyer, not a maternity hospital.
I'm sorry there isn't something more we can do to help her.
There is something you can do, sir.
Transfer her to the Chattanooga, get her in the hands of a real doctor.
That's the one thing we can't do.
We'd have to bring the Warren and the Chattanooga to a stop.
That would be inviting disaster.
I keep thinking of that girl's husband, inviting disaster every time he flies his ship off the deck of that carrier.
I'd hate to tell him that the Navy considers saving the life of his wife and baby
- to great a risk. - Masterman, he's doing a job. So are we.
Yeah, I know. Can't make decisions based on sentiment...
Or humanity.
Yes?
From the Warren, sir.
"Report Mrs. Collin's condition critical. Request instructions. "
- Ah. - If she could only be transferred here...
No, no, no, that's impossible. I cannot jeopardize a 30 ship convoy and it's escort.
Well, in that case, we may as well turn in.
- Must be almost dawn.
- Turn in?
Stone, have you ever been a father?
- Why, no sir.
- Well, you should've been.
And perhaps you could've helped her with this launching.
You talk about this baby as though it were a ship.
Well, it's practically the same procedure.
If a ship hangs on the ways, you give her a start with a good sound thump from an oak timber.
That's it. A thump!
- But I can't see that... - Did you know that in the days of the sailing ships in the British Navy, the sailor's wives often went along on the old frigates and when a woman couldn't bring off a launching by herself, the gunner always started with a salvo to Lord.
Oh, that old superstition.
Yes, I've heard those yarns from old timers.
You mean some old fogeys like me.
- Oh, no sir. - Do you presume to call one of the oldest naval traditions superstition?
Well sir, if you really think it'd do any good.
Why don't you give the Warren the order to fire a gun to Lord.
No, no. That'll reveal our position to the enemy.
And the safety of the convoy must come before one life.
Even a woman's.
- Yes.
- Enemy aircraft sighted...
Enemy aircraft sighted, sir!
Listen...
We've been hit!
Standby for action!
Did you hear that?
We're in action!
I gotta get to my station!
Steady, Johnson, steady.
Look sir, the flagship's been hit.
Enemy aircraft headed for convoy, sir.
Set fuses to three.
Range, 2-5-0-0.
Scale, 8-2.
- Fuse set!
- Set!
- On target!
- Rapid fire, commence firing!
Masterman's right on his target.
On target!
On target!
One for us!
Lindsay, right full rudder!
On target!
On target!
- They got him, sir!
- Nice shooting.
That's one clay pigeon that won't shoot back at anybody!
The flagship's out of control, sir!
Ludlow, what's the matter with our aircraft lookout?
Well, the plane glided in above the fog, and when first sighted, he was already diving.
- What's our damage? - We should have a full report in a moment, sir.
Ship's Damage Control Officer reports our plane catapult disabled and steering near out of control, sir.
Do something, confounded!
Can't stay here all day with my stern shut off.
That plane was launched from an enemy capital ship that's somewhere out here in this blasted fog!
We're doing all we can, sir.
- Your coat, sir.
- Nice kettle of fish.
Hit in the tail with a sneak punch by a slant-eyed Beelzebub.
Enemy battleship sighted, sir.
On the starboard bow.
Jap. Ishamoto Class.
- Ludlow, commence firing.
- Aye aye, sir.
A Jap battleship.
All my life I've been praying for a crack at one of those pagoda masted buzzards.
And here I am winged in the tail, sailing in circles like a blasted merry-go-round.
- Signal the convoy to scanner.
- Aye aye, sir.
Signal the Warren,
I'm out of control.
- Yes sir.
- Shot in the rear.
- Yes sir. - Don't put that last in the message.
Oh no, sir.
Shot at us with their first salvo!
Let them have it, Ludlow!
Radio from the Chattanooga.
She's out of control.
That puts it up to us.
Mr. Lindsay, I'm going ahead, full speed.
Tell the engine room to make smoke, we lay a smoke screen between the Jap and the convoy.
- Aye aye, sir. - We reverse course to the left standard rudder.
Left standard rudder, sir.
Look, sir! Through that break in the fog!
The Warren's reversing her course!
They've opened on the Warren with a secondary battery!
Roberts is covering with a smoke screen!
- Guns 1, 2, 4 commence firing!
- Guns 1, 2, 4 commence firing!
Duck!
Load!
Ready, one!
Four, ready!
- Send for me, sir?
- Yes, Masterman.
Here's my plan of attack.
The enemy's forced it's carrier directly into the convoy.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to cease firing.
In two minutes, reverse our course again, parallel to our smoke screen.
Then cut through and give her a surprise, and give her every torpedo we've got!
She's a battleship, she'll blast us out of the water!
- Almost certainly. - What about the women and children?
This isn't only a destroyer, it's a floating nursery.
I know... but in a situation like this, decisions cannot be influenced by personal feelings.
When you have a command, you'll realize that.
- Back to your battle station.
- Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Masterman!
The Captain's been hit!
You bad, sir?
Looks as if you... achieved command sooner neither of us expected.
Any orders, sir?
You'll do all right, Harvard.
Rock 'em and sock 'em.
OK, John Paul Jones.
Get the Captain below!
We'll take care of you.
I need you again, with Mrs. Collins.
All right, help me strap Johnson down.
I'm needed on deck, I tell ya.
Now, come on, lad.
Tell control to cease firing.
- Control, cease firing.
- Yes, sir?
Be ready to fire torpedoes on both sides.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Reverse course to the right.
Keep her parallel and behind the smoke screen.
- Right standard rudder.
- Right standard rudder.
The Warren's swinging behind her own smoke screen, sir.
They're firing blind behind the smoke screen, sir.
Yeah.
Still just popping away at things up there, Chips?
Don't be uneasy, Miss. Just because of a bit of a fuss up topside.
Mr. Lindsay, I'm going to come right 90 degrees off course.
Well, that'll just turn us back through our smoke screen, sir.
Right into the face of the enemy.
Exactly. I'm going to intercept the Jap at the nearest point.
I'm counting on surprise.
But she'll blow us right out of the water.
Right standard rudder,
Quartermaster.
Your new course is 1-7-5.
Right standard rudder, course 1-7-5, sir.
But Mrs. Collins and the other lady, sir.
And all those children...
There's only one way of giving the convoy a chance to scatter.
Let's come charging out of our smoke screen, and smack that Jap with a couple of torpedoes before he smacks us with a broadside.
But you can't throw away the lives of all those women and children.
Mr. Lindsay, the captain of a ship can't always do what he wants.
If you ever get command, you'll realize that.
Aye aye, sir.
What's the matter Rankin?
Bring her around!
The rudder's right standard, sir, but she hangs!
Well, give her right full then!
Give her right full, sir!
- Take the Chief below!
- Aye aye, sir!
- Johnson!
- Don't worry sir, we'll steer you a straight course.
We're about to enter the smoke screen.
- Steady up, 1-1-7-5.
- Steady up on 1-1-7-5.
- There she is, sir.
- Action port, commence firing!
Ready, one!
Ready, one!
Four, ready!
Fire torpedoes when ready!
Targeting 2-9-0!
Targeting angle 2-9-0!
Stand by tubes 2 and 4!
- Two and four standing by.
- Stand by.
- Fire one!
- Fire one!
- Fire two!
- Fire two!
- Fire three!
- Fire three!
- Good work, Martin!
- Thank you, sir.
She's headed for the smoke screen, sir!
Yeah and the convoy!
How many torps left?
Six on the starboard side, sir.
- Standby starboard battery.
- Aye aye, sir!
What are you gonna do, sir?
I'm going back through the smoke screen again and finish our job.
Right standard rudder, come to course 3-5-5 and steady!
Right standard rudder come to course 3-5-5 and steady, sir!
You all right, Johnson?
Aye aye, sir.
Hey Doc! The lady, hurry!
All right.
Increase to right,
20 degrees rudder.
Increase to right,
20 degrees rudder, sir.
Two points from the starboard bow, sir!
We're heading back towards the smoke screen, sir!
She's lefting heavily towards port!
Action starboard, commence firing.
- Speed 10! Target angle 1-2-0!
- Speed 10! Target angle 1-2-0!
Right, let's give her the works!
Aye aye, sir.
Stand by 223!
- Two-one ready.
- Torp three ready.
- Fire one!
- Fire one.
- Fire two!
- Fire two.
- Fire three!
- Fire three.
Mr. Lindsay, slow to standard speed.
Aye aye, sir!
There, sir.
Can you make it out?
Can't see a thing in this smoke and fog.
Guess that's the end of the old Warren, sir.
Yes, those poor women and babies.
That brave little ship.
Nice going, sir!
- Scratched one rice burner!
- We did it, sir! We did it!
A destroyer, like the battleship.
Mr. Lindsay, behaving like a Brooklyn baseball fan.
Sorry, sir.
Johnson!
- Quartermaster! Take the wheel!
- Aye aye, sir!
Mr. Masterman.
Are you all right, Johnson?
Yes, I'm as right as rain...
- I must've bumped my head.
- We just sunk a Jap battleship.
Sunk a Jap? Oy.
I must've slept all through it.
I feel as though I just woke up.
Do you understand, Johnson? Your old lady the Warren, that everybody laughed at, just knocked over a Jap battle wagon.
Well, I'm not surprised sir. The
Warren can lick anything afloat!
Look sir! Over the starboard quarter!
It's the Warren, sir!
Incredible! It was the Jap that blew up!
Yes, the Warren knocked her out!
Here, here, here... you're acting like a bunch of school kids.
- Oh, come in, Masterman.
- How're you feeling, sir?
Much better, thank you.
- How's everything with you?
- Everything's under control, sir.
Total casualties, 12 men wounded.
All taken care of.
Forward gun disabled, otherwise no serious damage.
No casualties to the women and children.
I think that's all, sir.
Mr. Masterman, sir, can you come at once?
- It's very urgent.
- Yes...
Well, sir.
Ludlow, to the best of my knowledge, that was the single greatest destroyer action in naval history.
Magnificent, sir. If it hadn't been for the Warren, our whole convoy
- might've been lost.
- Yes.
- Ludlow, I re-commissioned her.
- Yes, sir.
From the Warren, sir.
- Message from the Warren, sir.
- Just one moment, Dudley.
Gentlemen, we are living one of those moments which may go down in history.
This message from the Warren might become as famous in the American Navy, as Paris, "We have met the enemy and they're ours. "
Well? Read it.
It's a boy.
- Hm? - Yes, sir. It's a boy.
- Seven pounds, four ounces.
It's a boy.
It's a boy.
Seven pounds, four ounces.
Sun of a gun.
There's something grand about a homeward bound convoy, sir.
- Ha!
- Quite a homecoming, sir.
Hm? Quite.
We're making a fine tail to the Warren's kite.
They're probably laughing from
Cacosol to the Dutch Harbor, and from Iceland to Australia.
Never dare show my face in the Army-Navy Club again.
And I felt sorry sending
Roberts to sea in that old coffee pot.
Lieutenant Commander Roberts.
Lieutenant Masterman.
Chief Yeoman Johnson.
Front and center.
For extraordinary gallantry, and action against the enemy, the Navy Cross of the United States, is confirmed upon the following by order of the President of the United States.
Lieutenant Commander Martin J.
Roberts, USN Commanding.
- Congratulations, Roberts.
- Thank you, sir.
Lieutenant Gregg Masterman.
USNR.
- Congratulations Masterman.
- Thank you, sir.
Chief Yeoman Henry Johnson.
USN.
- Congratulations Johnson.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, Masterman, now that you're a blasted hero,
I suppose you think you've earned your lazy loops again.
Somehow, sir, oysters and Senate Committees don't seem so important to me now.
You're a couple of lucky dogs.
I give my flag just to stand in either of your shoes.
Destroyer in wartime.
That's a job for a real sailor.
Mind you, I'm going to camp outside the Commandant's office until I get priority on repairs and get back to sea again!
What do they expect me to do?
Spend eternity in a dry dock?
- I know just how you feel, sir.
- What?
- Leave to quarters.
- Aye sir.
Leave to quarters!
- Congratulations, sir.
- Congratulations yourself, Johnson.
Yes, indeed.
Seems funny. Me with a medal.
When only a little while ago I was afraid
I was never going to get to sea again.
But I have you to thank for that, sir.
And you, sir. It's been great being shipmates.
How soon before we shove off again, sir?
- Mr. Masterman.
- Yes, sir.
Do what you can to expedite our repairs and refueling.
- We want to get back to sea.
- Aye aye, sir.
That's the only place for a sailor. At sea.
Masterman.
Bows and arrows all checked?
Bows and arrows all shipshape, sir.
That's fine.
{3676}{3741}What?
{3748}{3833}Stop, stop the car.
{3848}{3943}You yeIIow skin, stop the car.

{6563}{6638}Where are you going?
{6643}{6788}Don't run away, you chick.
{6809}{6906}Come on, fight Iike a man.
{6912}{7072}Come on, don't run away.
{7084}{7171}You want to escape, don't go.
{7326}{7366}Don't go.
{7403}{7505}You are a chick, Iet's fight.
{7532}{7672}Fight Iike a man, come on.
{7704}{7831}You Japanese.
{8426}{8458}PupiI.
{9046}{9096}You may be invoIved.
{9118}{9185}I stay at the Bun MoteI.

{9706}{9753}Mr. Chee of the Station?
{9796}{9836}I know.
{9843}{9880}I have seen it in the newspaper.
{9897}{10022}Who beat Chuen at the|PoIice Competition.
{10186}{10266}Sorry, I am busy.
{11254}{11296}Miss Siu.
{11352}{11469}Any Ietters from Saam?
{11494}{11666}We've Iost contact since my dad died.
{11827}{11919}He must think...
{11923}{12008}It's him who kiIIed you dad.
{12036}{12093}To be sorry.
{12219}{12266}Anyway Miss Siu.
{12311}{12491}His advantage is honest.
{12556}{12608}He's not cIever.
{12627}{12782}But he's serious to himseIf.
{12787}{12849}Otherwise he can't Iive any Ionger.
{12862}{12962}That's pity.
{13000}{13112}Nowadays not many modern|students are that.
{13204}{13241}So...
{13276}{13413}I Iike him this way.
{13674}{13769}Forget it, it's painfuI.
{13806}{13853}Karate?
{13982}{14037}As strong as you are aIso feeIs pain.
{14105}{14160}Being a winner Iike you aIso feeIs pain.
{14247}{14284}It's sad aIthough I won.
{14321}{14366}Sometimes I don't want to win.
{14492}{14534}So you can...
{14606}{14641}Lose.
{14698}{14730}Can put it this way.
{14904}{14994}But I can't Iose.
{15069}{15136}Anyway I must win.
{15363}{15400}Sorry.
{15406}{15473}ShouIdn't taIk this to you.
{15518}{15574}I just want to say.
{15575}{15717}Learning Karate isn't that easy.
{15754}{15814}And I am not quaIified to be the master.
{15868}{15905}I am aIso a student.
{15971}{16016}Sorry.
{16084}{16139}Guests are coming.
{16253}{16388}Mr. Po, the transIator of|the American Embassy.
{16462}{16552}It's weII done for you to beat|the American.
{16564}{16654}Being a Japanese I aIso feeI excited.
{16661}{16798}A American boxer.
{16801}{16868}To Japanese he's a artist.
{16893}{16983}He's the strongest boxer in USA.
{16986}{17053}CaIIed WiIIiam Star, he's in Japan now.
{17070}{17135}He heard the news.
{17153}{17215}Say the boxing skiIIs of that saiIor.
{17221}{17348}It's a shame to say that is|the standard of a boxer.
{17378}{17425}What does he want?
{17430}{17495}That means...
{17499}{17559}For the Japanese and Americans,|you are the representative.
{17574}{17726}To have a fight with|the American representative WiIIiam .
{17742}{17794}That is.
{17803}{17850}What is boxing?
{17855}{17890}Boxing.
{17916}{17996}Means using fists to fight.
{18007}{18062}Two participants.
{18082}{18134}Wear the boxing gIoves.
{18136}{18316}To hit the opponent's upper body.
{18356}{18493}Then the face and the nose|wiII be bIeeding.
{18540}{18645}That's a bIoody tragedy.
{18653}{18703}The foreigners Iike that.
{18772}{18819}A competition of amusement.
{18870}{18907}I don't Iike to be a joker.
{18936}{18971}So...
{18984}{19029}I Iike quick and simpIe.
{19044}{19111}But there is a katate man wants|to take part.
{19122}{19169}None of my business.
{19207}{19274}No matter how.
{19315}{19347}No way.
{19448}{19558}At Ieast pIease have a Iook at it.
{19575}{19695}Coming at the American Embassy.
{19732}{19769}I wiII send you the invitation.
{19887}{19934}Storming.
{20515}{20612}I may get you invoIved.
{20709}{20764}Do they want to revenge?
{20799}{20836}Don't go to the Embassy.|I wiII go.
{20904}{20994}I want to see the fight.
{21759}{21849}It's not exciting to empIoy a referee.
{21854}{21909}It shouId be fighting tiII coIIapsed.
{22561}{22613}Get up, fight.
{24304}{24346}Where are you going?
{24359}{24389}Going home.
{24398}{24430}Why?
{24458}{24503}I don't Iike to see this pIay.
{24515}{24605}The fight between Star and the karate|man is about to start.
{24611}{24671}Ask them to stop.
{24716}{24761}Stop the fight.
{24777}{24814}How come?
{24826}{24896}They are too stupid.
{24925}{24997}Ask the to fight Iike chicken and dogs.
{25045}{25142}Japanese shouIdn't do this.
{26542}{26634}Everybody.
{26649}{26844}Very gIad to see that you Iike this fight.
{26860}{26892}Wait.
{27478}{27513}What?
{27544}{27594}Stop the fight.
{27640}{27672}Why?
{27675}{27715}For the Japanese Karate.
{27802}{27842}I don't think we'II Iose.
{27846}{27906}It's not the probIem of winning or Iosing.
{28015}{28050}For what?
{28356}{28396}Since boxing is not kung fu.
{28541}{28598}What do you fight for?
{28776}{28918}I am Kwan from Sam Stream, you are...
{28962}{29037}Saam Chee of the Station.
{29369}{29409}I teII you.
{29437}{29484}What do you fight for?
{29528}{29618}We are broke if we don't do this.
{29672}{29737}We have no other choice.
{29886}{29983}It may be because of you.
{33245}{33292}Master.
{33413}{33495}I think fighting is a pain.
{33568}{33663}I fight for karate with him.
{33692}{33817}I think onIy use the skiIIs to win.
{33854}{33961}Of course, the famiIy of the Ioser.
{33990}{34120}And the foIIowers wiII hate me.
{34122}{34199}For kung fu, I don't mind.
{34214}{34334}But for winning.
{34343}{34420}See many are beaten.
{34467}{34507}I reaIIy want to forget karate.
{34624}{34674}Finish.
{34770}{34917}Two years experience on traveI.
{34996}{35043}That's aII.
{35204}{35256}Nothing has changed.
{35283}{35323}You are stiII the same.
{35554}{35664}I see your pain.
{35727}{35759}No.
{35782}{35894}Your pain is my pain.
{36015}{36112}But I beIieve.
{36182}{36307}That's necessary for the future.
{36533}{36715}Fighting is the way to unite the others.
{36809}{36909}Agreements can't bring true peace.
{36989}{37049}Don't be afraid of the constraints.
{37156}{37203}I...
{37239}{37376}BeIieve karate to be invoIved in the fight.
{37534}{37691}It's not the fight for the name.
{37803}{37913}That's not my priye.
{37962}{38037}Not your winning either.
{38079}{38126}No.
{38152}{38224}Can be said that's aIso not the winning|for karate.
{38308}{38483}That's the winning for the Japanese Arts.
{38862}{38914}Mr. Chee.
{38953}{39000}Mr. Chee.
{39006}{39046}Haven't you had your dinner?
{39076}{39118}Coming to have it in the Station?
{39163}{39218}To eat with you in the Kitchen.
{39224}{39296}100o/o Iike a student.
{39334}{39429}I thought the famous Saam Chee.
{39434}{39516}Must be scary with Iong beard.
{39550}{39585}ReaIIy.
{39594}{39669}My grand chiIdren are scared.
{39689}{39744}The songs say.
{39763}{39825}Saam is coming.
{39841}{39876}Don't sing.
{39923}{40025}It's not good not to be true.
{40053}{40093}It's because it's too strong.
{40117}{40172}Better to be simpIer.
{40440}{40535}It's Iong time not to see you|scratch your head.
{40557}{40614}Haven't seen your beard face for|a Iong time.
{40806}{40893}The four men of the Station are here.
{41012}{41129}Good.
{41288}{41355}Haven't seen you for a Iong time.
{42668}{42728}I am back.
{42823}{42905}I am sorry for your dad.
{43062}{43137}I am coming to see him.
{44886}{44951}You are the same.
{45148}{45195}Master aIso says that.
{45285}{45332}I am useIess.
{45400}{45457}I aIways feeI worried.
{45519}{45554}No way.
{45777}{45849}I can't even Iove woman.
{45883}{46005}Can't do anything to be a chick.
{47013}{47103}Regards from Siu.
{47202}{47304}The cIothes on your body.
{47305}{47502}It's time to change, take it.
{47564}{47604}However...
{47686}{47756}Take it.
{48175}{48217}A strange man has come.
{48431}{48483}What's your name?
{48487}{48532}Tin Kuo.
{48682}{48714}The other one.
{48727}{48772}Yuen Kuo.
{49094}{49139}PIease have a Iook at the Station.
{49143}{49208}Tin and Yuen Kuo.
{49499}{49559}SaIute before going in.
{49591}{49658}We don't have this kind of saIute.
{49682}{49782}It may be the ruIes of foreigners.
{49796}{49838}But here is Japan.
{49856}{49888}Forget it.
{50067}{50154}Woo, Chun.
{50172}{50254}Ten, Saam Chee.
{50341}{50413}Is Samm Chee here?
{50618}{50670}He's here.
{51880}{52382}Yuen.
{52813}{52870}I am Chin.
{52925}{52982}It's karate.
{53039}{53114}Tin Kuo of Kuo Karate.
{53139}{53184}He's Yuen.
{53225}{53325}PIease forgive my brother|who broke the waII.
{53343}{53378}Since he's sick.
{53424}{53519}Is Chee Kuo...
{53527}{53592}Your reIative?
{53635}{53757}My eIder brother is too weak.
{53786}{53846}His karate...
{53857}{53914}I think it's too strong.
{53926}{53968}Why?
{53998}{54073}But he Iost to Chee.
{54113}{54183}But my karate is very different.
{54208}{54265}Have you seen karate?
{54309}{54389}Your brother just showed.
{54398}{54435}That's a joke.
{54464}{54511}To warm up.
{54562}{54614}I want to fight with Chee.
{54630}{54687}That's why I come here.
{54757}{54792}Sorry we can't accept.
{54802}{54824}Why?
{54846}{54883}We are different.
{54985}{55162}I think your karate is not an art.
{55253}{55365}No saIute before coming in the Station.
{55411}{55478}No saIute when seeing a man.
{55535}{55680}This kind of man isn't an artist at|any time.
{55779}{55864}You reaIIy can taIk.
{56124}{56249}WiII you accept if he agrees?
{56282}{56314}Too stupid.
{56319}{56349}No.
{56374}{56434}Chee is my student.
{56475}{56517}We have the same spirit.
{56586}{56663}The Station is so weak.
{56727}{56787}Let's go Yuen.
{57114}{57194}Chin, we won't forget it.
{57246}{57331}Chee is brave.
{57358}{57403}He Ioves pIaying Iives.
{57665}{57755}Angry?
{57816}{57956}Those who are impoIite are|the most frightening.
{58155}{58225}Who have a fight with him|wiII be kicked out.
{58260}{58317}Who have a show in the pubIic|wiII be kicked out.
{58333}{58440}Who have a drink or sing in the Station|wiII be kicked out.
{58690}{58757}How about you?
{58871}{58908}I can't stand it.
{59302}{59329}Are you OK?
{59385}{59417}I can't sIeep if I don't do this.
{59452}{59479}Why?
{59725}{59870}Why do I have so many enemies?
{59890}{59925}Because I am too good.
{59961}{60043}Hate makes peopIe weak.
{60051}{60141}I used to hate but I don't now.
{60178}{60205}Just...
{60210}{60235}Just.
{60258}{60383}Don't want to hate, just have a fight.
{60433}{60520}Are you thinking of karate?
{60568}{60613}Not just that.
{60712}{60814}Not faII asIeep yet.
{60963}{61018}The moon is good.
{61348}{61433}I have thought so many things|in teaching.

{62470}{62550}The side skiIIs.
{62610}{62642}The knee skiIIs.
{62691}{62723}The kicking skiIIs.
{62776}{62813}Kicking more the outside.

{69483}{69540}Aren't you Tin?
{69614}{69696}Their target is us.
{69748}{69873}If we say we are from the Station,|then...
{69895}{69942}Bastard.
{69960}{70017}They use karate.
{70055}{70090}No.
{70342}{70409}How are you brother?
{70634}{70761}Where are you going? FuII of anger.

{77690}{77792}Your techniques are usefuI now.
{78133}{78238}Be caIm, he just faIIs asIeep.
{78432}{78479}Kuo has come.
{78531}{78553}Two together.
{78560}{78620}It's Yuen.
{79140}{79385}I Iost to karate, and I am being sick.
{79421}{79531}But I feeI proud of the spirit.
{79536}{79588}You can stiII work.
{79596}{79703}You must fight for the Japanese art.
{79724}{79866}The God won't aIIow me to do this.
{79899}{79951}Neither peopIe.
{79981}{80126}But I Iike the spirit of karate.
{80136}{80221}Remain in the history of Japanese karate.
{80223}{80285}Must remain in the history.
{80498}{80560}How is Mr. Chin?
{80592}{80694}He's weII, thank you.
{80717}{80779}It's so good of you.
{80955}{81047}About your brother.
{81144}{81309}They have gone to do exercise in the hiII.
{81354}{81441}To prepare for the fight.
{81497}{81592}Both are my brothers.
{81619}{81689}I don't hate them.
{81708}{81820}But they don't know how to be a man.
{81856}{81923}Tin is a snake.
{81987}{82194}He has got my worst former|disadvantage.
{82330}{82492}Yuen is sick.
{82528}{82600}He's reaIIy sick.
{82650}{82730}Happening since he's a chiId.
{82768}{82913}Being crueI before happening.
{82962}{83094}PIease get rid of him.
{83127}{83179}Don't fight with them.
{83231}{83293}I am not saying for them.
{83325}{83412}I am for your sake.
{83426}{83511}No, it's for the Japanese Arts.
{84168}{84263}Thanks.
{84380}{84505}Saam is coming.
{84519}{84646}Don't touch him.
{84659}{84796}Don't get cIoser, hurry to run.
{84804}{84944}You'II have a pain if you come|across him.
{85197}{85277}It's the secret of Kuo Stream.
{85313}{85405}You were born to fight.
{85494}{85584}Let me say again.
{85619}{85784}For the Japanese Arts you are|more important.
{85821}{85861}Thanks.
{86070}{86112}Are you going?
{86161}{86213}I see you off.
{86230}{86272}LuckiIy there is a car.
{86341}{86438}I used to be a driver.
{86574}{86611}Sorry.
{86681}{86731}Are you coId?
{86747}{86782}No worries.
{86789}{86866}Put down the cover.
{86911}{87021}No, I want to see the scene.
{87090}{87182}I may have no chance to see again.
{87253}{87373}Saam is coming.
{87380}{87512}Don't touch him.
{87526}{87651}Don't get cIoser, hurry to run.
{87668}{87790}You'II have a pain if you come|across him.
{88093}{88135}Brother Chee.
{88149}{88184}PIease.
{88188}{88230}PIease put down the cover.
{88255}{88322}I feeI coId.

{93269}{93381}To fight at the HiII on 15th December.
{93387}{93509}Two of us are waiting,|pIease don't forget.
{93537}{93599}Tin and Yuen Kuo.
{93773}{93808}Are you going?
{93835}{93882}I'd rather be kicked out of the Station.
{93925}{94030}I must break three ruIes.
{94274}{94321}I have drunk wines here.
{94409}{94441}And.
{94481}{94521}I don't want to escape.
{94554}{94599}I broke two ruIes.
{94604}{94641}What is the other one?
{94946}{94976}Break it by the way.
{94996}{95061}Who have a show in the pubIic|wiII be kicked out.
{95708}{95798}This is the main event today.
{95829}{95934}Japan-America friendIy fight:|boxing to karate.
{95962}{96112}American champion WiIIiam Star.
{96376}{96521}He's the giant of 80 kg.
{96530}{96602}The power of his fist.
{96618}{96740}Can break bricks and bend iron board.
{96811}{96886}Is a iron man.
{96918}{97103}His nake name is kiIIer.
{97134}{97286}The chaIIenger is a genius|in Japanese karate.
{97300}{97412}But his name can't be reIeased.
{97422}{97784}Saam Chee.
{97883}{98018}The reward is 1000 doIIars.
{98055}{98122}It's incredibIe fight.
{98130}{98262}Wind comes before the rain.
{98266}{98321}About to start.
{98334}{98454}Stop introducing here.
{98462}{98529}The fight starts.
{104994}{105104}Brother Chee, thank you.
{105265}{105387}Do you forget me?
{105429}{105531}I am Kwan who was defeated by Star.
{106482}{106579}I come to apoIogiye.
{106661}{106696}Brother Chee.
{106736}{106881}PIease forgive my words.
{107831}{107936}Master, I Ieave the Station tonight.
{108038}{108080}I put down the board myseIf.
{108116}{108298}You mean to get rid of the Station.
{108314}{108349}This say is not good.
{108406}{108583}I don't want to be kicked out so|I put down the name board myseIf.
{108599}{108644}What do I do wrong?
{108749}{108799}I have braken the ruIes.
{108828}{108865}To have a fight with foreigners.
{108915}{108982}They don't know Japanese Arts.
{109039}{109149}I can ignore or teach them.
{109198}{109348}I think I shouId teach them.
{109422}{109479}Just for this.
{109620}{109757}You are stupid.
{109821}{109991}You are stupid to the ruIes.
{110026}{110058}RuIes are ruIes.
{110113}{110168}You are for the Arts.
{110220}{110355}Your heart hasn't broken the ruIes.
{110400}{110582}The truth doesn't bothered by the ruIes.
{110665}{110715}Saam.
{110784}{110934}You go to put back the name board.
{111015}{111047}No way.
{111061}{111271}Put back if you feeI understanding.
{111318}{111505}It's OK to put back after 10 to 20 years.
{111855}{111917}I am tired.
{111970}{112012}You go back.
{112090}{112170}Let me stay here tonight.
{112178}{112218}I want to think.
{112240}{112375}You just can faII asIeep.
{112388}{112428}It's good if I can sIeep.
{112450}{112490}I can't sIeep recentIy.
{112496}{112521}Why?
{112523}{112560}The enemies aIways appear.
{112572}{112614}Isn't that fight finished?
{112619}{112681}No, it's the next opponents.
{112703}{112740}Want to fight again.
{112814}{112851}It's karate.
{113021}{113098}AIthough I Iearn kung fu,|sweep the fIoor.
{113131}{113211}CIean the corridor, take the water.
{113237}{113309}Chop the wood, make meaIs.
{113361}{113446}Do it aII the time.
{113469}{113529}I stiII can't sIeep.
{113649}{113744}Good.
{113810}{113910}I think with you.
{114202}{114237}Sorry.
{114267}{114332}I cook for you tomorrow morning.
{114368}{114408}There is a secret in cooking.
{114414}{114459}Don't make noise.
{114494}{114649}You must Iook at those who tackIe you.
{114747}{114852}UntiI he disappears.
{114862}{114899}Understand?
{116875}{116957}I stiII can't do that.
{117959}{118029}Left for a Iong time.
{118045}{118080}About a year.
{118126}{118161}Two years.
{118195}{118242}Three years.
{118480}{118602}In fact I went to fight.
{118610}{118702}No worries, you wiII win.
{118730}{118755}No...
{118766}{118838}You must win.
{121300}{121335}You are back.
{121797}{121827}AIone.
{121943}{121978}Yuen is not coming.
{121999}{122026}Why?
{122030}{122097}The sickness happens again.
{122752}{122787}You are having good Iuck.
{122877}{122922}However.
{122965}{123060}Going to heII after trying the karate.
{134006}{134058}Finished cooking.
{134472}{134539}FeeI the energy after eating.
{134624}{134661}Don't eat.
{134687}{134722}Are you having a fever?
{134785}{134862}I give you some coId water.
{135339}{135399}You aIso don't eat.
{135654}{135699}I put it here.
{142922}{143032}You must win.
{145700}{145796}It's coId, I heat it up now.
{145979}{146034}You aIso can eat.
{146088}{146168}I go to bring some water.
{146535}{146670}Lost...
Halt! Halt!
Two-eight-two squadron.
Two- eight-two squadron.
Crew of D for Danny.
Report to operations room.
That's us, Canada.
Two- eight-two squadron.
Crew of D for Danny.
Report to operations room.
Yeah, yeah. Be right with you.
Seven, so I win again.
Is it a rule of the game that you Yankees always win?
We win at this, you pick up marbles at cricket.
But we don't use marbles for cricket.
- Terry. Terry.
Yeah?
CO wants us in ops.
- Okay.
Did my transfer to Interceptor Command come through yet?
You're going to be sent back to Australia to that new intelligence outfit.
- Huh?
- He is?
Yeah, going to search kangaroo's pouches for fifth columnists.
Very funny. Very funny.
They're keeping you Australians in the bombers.
Keeping in the Australians in the bombers?
Well, if that isn't typical brass hat idiocy.
The Australians are fighting men.
We're not truck drivers.
Oh. Very well, Mr. Bones. Why are they keeping the Australians in the bombers?
They have sensible men to keep them from running amuck.
I see.
And he sang as he sat
And waited while his billy boiled
- Are you still eating breakfast?
- No, sir. Lunch.
Learned during the last war, never miss the meal in front of you.
Crew of D, reporting.
Flight Sergeant Connors is on leave.
- All others, present.
- Yes, I know that, Lane-Ferris.
We detailed Hollis to take his place.
Squadron Leader Lane-Ferris is captain of your aircraft.
- You will report to him for orders.
- Sir.
Glad to have you.
Take the wireless operator's position.
- Very good.
- Get your crew seated, please.
Sir. Carry on, men.
Are you the son of Lloyd Hollis who got 43 Jerries during the last war?
- Yes.
- Didn't take you long to get in this.
Wouldn't that be expected of an ace's son?
I saw your dad get two of them.
In a trench near Bar-le-duc.
He was above...
Stop talking and pay attention, please.
All right. Sit down.
Squadron Leader Clark from Group
Headquarters has something to tell you.
- Will you carry on, please?
- Very good, sir.
A few hours ago, we received a report...
...that the rail intersection east of Schneidemuhl...
...was dynamited last night by Polish saboteurs.
This is the switch point.
All these lines carry abnormally heavy traffic.
And a sizable blockade of munition trains has undoubtedly occurred.
The Nazis are sure to reopen the right of way within the next 12 hours.
But if we can put one stick of bombs there before dawn...
...we will have done more to advance the cause than ten raids on as many factories.
That's your job, gentlemen.
The enemy is sure to have a heavy concentration of anti-aircraft batteries...
...to protect the point.
But if the weather permits...
...you should be able to carry out your attack from high altitude.
- That's all I have to say, sir.
- Thank you.
May I have the large-scale map, please?
Thank you.
Now, here is Schneidemuhl.
Quite a bit beyond our normal bombing territory.
Actually on the edge of the old Polish border.
Now, you make your approach along this line...
...crossing Denmark, coming over the Baltic...
...swinging inland over Pommersche Bay.
From there, you shouldn't have difficulty in reaching your objective.
- Terry?
- Yup.
I want you to help me with a star sight this trip.
Sure. I'll get you a nice, new shiny one every ten minutes.
Every half hour will be enough.
That's if you can keep serious that long.
This is important.
Johnny, old Canada is going serious on us again.
Throw him a leadful of decimal points.
He'll be happy.
Here's the result of long Canadian winters.
Nothing to do but sit by the fire, figure out income tax.
Now, no kidding. Star sights will be most important this trip.
Most of the way, we'll be going over the water...
...with no chance for contact checks.
And if we can't keep a...
I was saying that most of the way, we'll...
Say, look at these new fighters.
Yes.
Gee, that's where I'd like to be, flying one of these babies.
Things like that in the air and we fly an ice wagon.
Yeah, sure. Now, look, Terry.
If you take one sight just after we set the course...
...and another about...
- Oh, sure.
Sure, I'll get you all the figures you want.
Air speed, wind speed, drift, oil pressure, engine temperature, altitude, the works.
And if you play your cards right...
...I may throw in a couple of old telephone numbers for good measure.
- I'll fly the first leg, Terry.
- Okay.
Take these with you.
- I want to check the first wireless bearings.
- How could I refuse?
Mother Hubbard goes down into her cupboard.
Yeah, to lay a few eggs.
- Are your starters plugged in?
- Yes, sir.
- Starboard rear gunner in position, sir.
- Okay.
- Wireless operator in position, sir.
- Okay.
- Port roar gunner in position, sir.
- Okay.
- Navigator in position, sir.
- Okay.
- Midship gunner in position, sir.
- Okay.
- Bomb aimer in position, sir.
- Okay, Mother.
Crew in position.
Ready for takeoff, sir.
Cockpit check complete.
Ready to start up.
- Start up your port outboard engine.
- Yes, sir.
Cut it out, will you?
This is very important.
Here's your figures, sweetheart.
Thanks.
Say, can't you get some hot conga music on that?
German stations are off the air.
Boys must be giving a pasting tonight.
- How are we doing, navigator?
Oh, seem to be right on course.
What's our indicated air speed, please?
Three forty.
- Thanks. You guessed right.
- Guessed it?
I felt it. Tell him how your old man flew the last war...
...with a float compass and the seat of his pants. Go on.
If you get a kick out of doing figures, go ahead.
But I'll tell you when we're over the target.
That's you again. You promised you'd tell me how to do that. You never did.
- Will you have a sandwich, sir?
- Yeah, thanks.
- Will you save me the bag?
- Yeah, here you are.
Hello, skipper?
Position due north of Swinemunde.
Turn to one-six-two.
Turn to one-six-two.
Right.
Put one-six-two on the gyro.
- Take over now, Terry.
- Right.
Look at those clouds.
- I bet they stretch clear into Poland.
They may open.
I'll bet you five to a stick of bombs they don't.
You can hold the stakes in your lap.
- Any contact checks?
- Nope. Not a thing.
We're nearly over the objective.
Hello, Johnny?
Keep an eye open for landmarks.
Landmarks? I'm more likely to see a noodle in that soup.
Halt.
Attention, attention, airport.
Four-motored bomber,
9500 meter, position M-5.
Well, looks like we go down under, eh?
We've got an hour's extra petrol.
We'll stay high.
- Maybe the clouds will open.
- Those clouds? Ha.
Why not go down, get it over with?
Too chancy.
You heard what that fellow said...
...about a concentration of anti-aircraft to protect the point.
- Yeah, but...
- We'd be sitter shots.
Under that low ceiling.
Bet you if we did go down, we'd take them by surprise.
Could blast them out before they knew what hit them.
If we had the flight here, we might try it with one plane.
But since we're the only plane and the objective must be knocked out...
...we'll cruise around.
Keep your eye open...
...for a break in the clouds.
- All right.
What's that?
- What's what?
I don't know. Looks like a shadow.
Jed. Get him out of here, quick.
We got him. We got him.
You got him. Get 42 more, you'll tie your old man's record.
Nice shooting. Hang on to something.
- I'm going down through this muck.
- But skipper said...
Brace yourself, boy. Ready up front?
- Ready here.
- All right.
First one to spot anything, give me a call. Hang on.
Hello, Johnny. Drop a flare. Drop a flare.
There's the rail line.
Hello, Johnny. Hello, Johnny.
We're gonna circle and come back in.
Bomb doors open.
Going in now. Going in now.
One thousand feet at 300 per.
One thousand feet at 300 per.
Ten degrees right. Ten degrees right.
You're on.
Steady as you go.
Both port engines are gone.
Hello, Edwards. Hello, Edwards.
Communicator's knocked out.
Tell the men to stand by for a crash landing.
- Are we hit bad?
- Yeah.
Take the skipper back.
I think we're gonna land hard.
Motorcyclists, attention!
To the scene of the crash, approximately three kilometers cast of the main road.
Terry.
Terry.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so.
Johnny, Johnny, how are you?
I'm all right.
Had the wind knocked out of me.
Who's got that light?
- It's me, Edwards.
- Somebody give me a hand with Hollis.
- Go ahead, Johnny.
Jed, give me a hand with the skipper.
I can make it. Don't bother with me.
I'll go back and help the others.
- Is he badly hurt, sir?
- Pretty bad. Give me that flash.
Yes, sir.
I'm all right. Just a bit dizzy.
Get them away.
Everything's soaked with petrol.
- Are the others?
- Yeah, all of them.
Hey, what's that?
Into the bushes, quick.
- But Kenton, Warrick, Evans.
- All dead, kid.
- But their bodies.
- He had to do it. The bomb sight's in there.
Come on, quick. Get moving.
Don't go so close. It may explode.
- Prussians.
- Did he say so?
No, but I know the accent.
You understand that stuff?
- Come again?
- I said sure.
Come on. We can go.
They are all burned, anyhow.
I think so too.
The sergeant guessed they'd all been killed in the crash...
...and the trooper agreed with him.
Come on. We gotta get out of here.
The skipper's bleeding pretty badly.
Look, blood.
Did we...?
Did we did we flatten the target?
Sure, you bet, skipper. Knocked it cold.
Three direct hits.
I knew we could.
If we stayed high.
Told you.
Going in low...
...suicide.
Hands up. You are prisoners.
The major orders to bring in the English prisoners right now.
The major orders to bring in the English prisoners right now.
Come on. Come on.
Line up the prisoners in front of the desk.
Says line up.
Step back.
Major, the prisoners have been brought in.
The questions I will ask you are purely routine.
Your names will be given to the International Red Cross...
...so that your country may be notified that you are prisoners of war.
Your name and rank.
Go ahead, kid. You can tell him that.
- Your name and rank.
- Lloyd Hollis II, flight sergeant.
By any chance the son of the English ace of the last war?
He's my father.
I see. Too bad you will not have the opportunity...
...to follow in your father's footsteps.
- You?
- Flying Officer Johnny Hammond.
You?
Flying Officer Jed Forrest.
You?
- Well?
- Kirk Edwards, sir. Flight sergeant.
T. Forbes, flight lieutenant.
Lieutenant, your squadron and station numbers.
- Don't tell him that.
- Why not?
Group 929, station 428.
I am quite aware there're not so many units...
...in the British Air Force.
You will give me the correct numbers.
Okay. Group one, station one.
As senior officer, you will have the good sense...
...to tell your men that full cooperation will be to their advantage.
We have decent instincts, but we have also an iron fist.
No?
You are prisoners, gentlemen, and you are going to a prison camp.
That is a circumstance over which you have no control.
Your stay at the camp can be either tolerable or otherwise.
That depends upon you.
If I make a little check mark here...
...it will indicate that you are eligible for exchange at a later date.
If I make it here, it will tell an entirely different story.
I can assure that a prison camp can be most annoying.
It's all right for a visit.
Wouldn't care to live there.
Oh, we could stand it for a month or so.
Already counting upon the possibility of escape?
We won't have to bother about escaping.
Your blitzkriegs have stopped blitzing.
War will be over before we gnaw our way through your barbed wire, even if ersatz.
A most deluded viewpoint.
Nothing can stop our armies.
And your bombing attacks have been little more than an irritation.
As for the assistance of a few decadent democracies...
I see you find the view most interesting.
Let it go. Already too late.
Too bad you saw that.
Now you cannot even be considered for exchange.
You will be placed in separate confinement for the duration of the war.
How unlucky to be so observant.
Just at a moment when we seem to be reaching a realistic view of your problem.
I regret that it must be the iron fist.
And so, gentlemen, our interview is concluded.
You are dismissed.
Lead the prisoners out.
You, the last man.
- Me?
- Yes. Come back here.
I have some questions to ask you.
- Your name is?
- Johnny Hammond. What's yours?
Major Otto Bau...
You will find that, in your position, impertinence does not pay.
I didn't join up with this war to make money.
- You are an American?
- Half American, half Jersey City.
You may sit down, Hammond.
- You may go.
- Yes, major.
Americans are good businessmen.
They are noted for their ability to make smart deals.
Means they had the good sense to take advantage of the situation.
That plane you were flying,
American-built, wasn't it?
One of the new ones.
We have heard a good deal about them.
We know that they are capable of operating at amazing altitudes.
How do you manage to supercharge the engines...
...at the extreme cold of those high altitudes?
If I told you, the others wouldn't find out?
Certainly not.
Sure they can't hear us out there?
Quite sure.
Now, about the supercharger.
- It's done with a thermotrockle.
- A what?
Thermotrockle amfilated through a daligonitor.
Of course, this is made possible because the dernadyne has a franicoupling.
- I do not understand you.
- I knew you wouldn't.
The amsometer on the side prenulates the kinutaspel hepulace.
That's the entire secret.
There you have it.
I do not follow you.
Well, maybe I could make it more clear if I drew a diagram.
Certainly.
There's three things you gotta understand.
As I said before, the daligonitor is amfilated by the thermotrockle.
It's made by its connection with the franicoupling of dernadyne.
Even at cruising speed...
...the kinutaspel hepulace is prenulated by the amsometer.
Makes no difference.
Could be taking off.
Snowing or raining, any pilot will tell you that the altitude, 10, 20, 30, 40,000 feet...
Who is spitting at me?
That must stop.
- Oh, Terry. He wants to talk to you.
- Oh.
- Stay there.
- The major wants to see me.
Go.
The iron fist has a glass jaw.
At your command, major.
Schuman, the major wants you. Hurry up.
Attention.
About face.
Now, bring in my comrades. Come on.
The major orders to bring in the prisoners once more.
Come on. In here.
Here we go again, boys.
Major!
- Out the window, quick!
The Fuehrer speaks in five minutes over the radio...
...from Russia.
Probably news about a victory, major.
Major.
Major. Major.
Memo. Request for transfer.
Kirk's in trouble.
He's run into them or he'd be back by now.
Don't worry. He can handle himself.
I don't know.
Hey, here's a dilly. Listen to this.
"To the commandant, the Ninth District.
If our gallant allies on the Russian front, the three picked Italian Infantry Divisions...
...continue to advance at present rate, they should reach their objective by spring."
- What's their objective?
- Rome.
Oh.
- Looks as though...
- Something important?
"Prenzlau, Görlitz..."
- We've hit the jackbox.
- Jackpot.
- Yeah.
- What is it? What is it?
Baumeister's recommendation for protection of the underground Messerschmitt factories.
Those trucks at Arnswalde weren't coming out of a gopher hole.
That's not all. There's five more of them.
"Prenzlau, Görlitz, Luckenwalde,
Freiberg, Eger."
Enough information on the camouflage plan to lead our bombers right to them.
We take that back to England, they'll give us Buckingham Palace.
Johnny, here's something that'll interest you.
"These factories must attain top production within two months."
Very interesting. What does it mean?
Oh. "These factories must attain maximum output within 90 days.
They are our Führer's answer to America's exaggerated promises...
...of assembly line production.
With the new Messerschmitt 114s gaining air supremacy...
...over the English and Irish ports...
...our bombers will make certain that not one soldier or bullet will reach England...
...from the degenerate democracy across the water."
Degenerate democracy.
That's a great crack, coming from Adolf.
People in Jersey City aren't gonna like that.
If we can get this information home, we'll flatten Adolph's prize factories...
...faster than his generals get apoplexy.
- But how...?
The one at Arnswalde, we'll keep for ourselves.
We'll tell the CO we ought to get the first crack at it, because...
- Wake the kid. Go ahead.
- Hollis, wake up. Shh. Quiet.
Any luck?
- There is no food left in Germany.
I went through three farm houses. Nobody lived there. They hadn't left a crumb.
- Met a rat in a closet, eating its heart out.
- Who was it, Goebles?
It couldn't been if it had a heart.
What now?
We'll do better further west.
Where are we now?
As near as I can figure, we're here.
That's roughly 400 miles to the Channel coast.
Well, let's get started. We'll head west.
Maybe we'll get to swipe a car or something.
- Still got this.
Wait a minute.
We can't take risks like that.
You like slogging around in this muck?
I'm as cold and hungry as the rest of you.
But there's more at stake than our own necks.
We've got information to take back.
Valuable information about those
Messerschmitt factories.
Or maybe you'd forgotten about that.
No, I haven't forgotten about it.
You got the makings of a first-class brass hat.
Oh, come on. Let's break it up.
Let's get started.
I don't understand it. Every time
I went foraging during the last war...
...I always came back with something.
A ham or a chicken or a cheese.
I remember once we were billeted back at Wipers and I got a cow.
A whole cow.
I got the head of it mounted in my living room now.
- What did you do with the rest of it?
- I ate it.
Hang on, kid.
Soon as the sun comes up, you can sleep until it sets again.
Hang on to me.
Quickly. We cannot lose any time.
I brought the map along, and can give you an exact report.
- Speak English?
- Like I was in London born.
- Heard anything?
- They have not been found yet.
Where are your posts?
At each red circle, a sentry.
At each square, a guard post.
- What of these bridges?
- Since there are sentries here and here.
Put a guard on every bridge, on every boat landing.
- Yes, sir.
- They'll make their way through the swamp.
The bridge guard will take them.
- You told him of those flyers?
- Not yet.
Silly ox, what are you waiting for?
Get me the sentry on the Mannenheim Bridge.
Hey, sun's gone down.
Time to get started.
Why do you have to wake me up every time I got a date with Ann Sheridan?
Come on, sonny. Daddy's gonna take us for another nice long walk.
Hey, wait a minute.
"Fellows, rather than bring the whole party to a standstill...
...l'm going to give myself up.
The best of luck, Lloyd."
- That crazy kid.
- We could have taken turns carrying him.
Or course we could, if he'd let us.
- His trail, through the rushes.
- Hasn't much of a start.
- It's a cinch he can't go fast.
- Sure. Come on.
I think the kid is right.
He knew we could never make it with him.
I suppose you want us to give him up.
- You're still in command.
- Thanks.
- Anything?
- Not a trace.
- Must've stayed on the pavement.
- lf he did, he's likely under arrest by now.
Hey! Hey!
- So tried to powder out on us, huh?
- We ought to give you a spanking.
- I thought that...
We couldn't get you through?
No, but that information, it's important.
And without me to slow things up...
Listen, kid.
You're just as important as that information.
You'll reach Piccadilly if I have to carry you piggy-back.
If that's where we're going, get started. I'm hungry.
- This is the right direction.
- Let's stay close to the rail.
Wait a minute. What's that?
Over the side, quick.
Say, sir, I've been thinking.
Suppose we get separated somehow.
Could you teach us enough German to make answers, in case...?
I know enough already.
Say, "Ja, hail Hitler," and, "Nein, hail Hitler."
Suppose someone asks you what time it is.
Show him on your fingers.
Yeah? Suppose it's 12:00.
You can always say, "No saber, senor."
Look, you better just listen to him in English.
Halt! Hands up!
Come on, higher!
Okay, okay. Don't get itchy.
Englishmen! Three steps closer.
He says, "Come closer."
Halt! Detachment, about face! March!
Turn around.
Hey, what time is it?
Shut up or you'll be shot!
Getting late.
Come on, you big pickle-puss.
Give me one chance to kick you in your goose step.
Your whining won't help you any.
You have to be quiet, understand?
Said pleading will get us nowhere.
Obviously doesn't understand English.
What is that?
- I'm telling them.
Uh-huh.
Now, when I say go, you hit him high.
Jed and Edwards, tackle him low.
I'll grab his pistol.
- Do you understand?
- I understand, Daddy.
Get on your mark, get set, go.
Now what?
Relief guard, halt!
At ease.
Koenig!
Koenig!
Where is that guy again?
What's that?
I think it come from under there.
Shut up, you idiot!
Follow me.
He's been drinking again.
Get that swine away from here.
Thunder and glory.
I'm gonna look conspicuous wearing these clothes and you all wearing...
Here comes my outfit now.
Looks like my size.
Pardon me.
Do you mind a slight dent in the helmet?
Fifty-two. Just right.
Green's just your color too.
- lf I looked good in blue, I'd be in the Navy.
Hey, look what I found.
- Here, Terry.
- Why me?
You speak the language.
You do the shopping.
- Heading west, isn't it?
- Sounds like it.
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Pull, Johnny.
I never saw a man so attached to a uniform.
Hey, this is Goring's private car.
It's on its way for an overhaul.
Good enough for Goring is almost good enough for me.
Come on.
The major, the...
Guard at the Mannenheim Bridge is missing.
Also the men sent to relieve him.
Signs of blood were nearby found.
The Englishmen. My car. My overcoat.
Come on. Hurry.
To the Mannenheim Bridge.
Give it all the gas possible.
No further news, major.
The uniforms and the bicycle we found underneath the bridge.
Yes. Somebody has been asleep on his post. At ease.
You are conversant with English?
I'm sorry. Cannot understand the major.
That's right. You wait here.
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.
Speak English.
I don't want anyone to understand.
The men must be found and mustn't be taken alive.
They'll be shot when they resist arrest.
Don't worry.
- What do you mean?
- You can trust me.
I'll make sure Herr Colonel won't discover they learned about the factories from you.
Like to be transferred to front-line service in Russia?
No. No.
- Keep your tongue to yourself.
- Yes.
The men took uniforms of a sergeant and three privates.
Get more men, Kruse.
Circle this area thoroughly.
Ask him how many trains stopped at the water tower...
...the past two hours.
- Yes.
How many trains have stopped within the last hour at the water tower?
Only one. About 12:00 midnight.
Goes right through to Berlin then.
Only one. Westbound.
No stops until Berlin.
I heard him. Berlin. Stay here and take charge of the search in case...
What?
- The men aren't on the train...
...when I meet it in Berlin.
- Yes.
Hurry. Let's go. To the airport.
I'd trade places with that guy, whoever he is.
- What guy?
- Some bandit in a plane headed west.
Making ten miles to our one.
We're not doing so badly.
Goring's private car, luxurious furnishings.
Funny pictures to look at.
Say, Terry and Edwards have been gone a long time, haven't they?
About 15 minutes.
Hey, I'm getting pretty good.
Hit him right between the medals.
Writing a book about your trip through Germany?
No. Facts and figures.
You just can't get over having been a bookkeeper, can you?
No, I liked it.
These are copies of the plans of the factories.
Five copies. So if only one of us gets back, any one of us...
- Cheerful little cuss, aren't you?
- No, just practical.
Maybe they got in trouble.
I ought to go help them.
- lf they did, you'd better stay here.
- And let them have all the fun?
Look, the boy scouts are awake.
Thought you were from the finance company. Pull up a swastika, sit.
Did you find out anything?
- Yeah.
This is the only deadhead car.
The rest's a hospital train.
We climbed on top, peeped through ventilators.
- Cars are jammed with wounded.
This train's from the east.
- They're from the Russian front.
- That's right.
All of those stories we hear about them hiding their wounded are true.
- Windows are blacked out, doors are locked.
- Terry heard doctors talking.
Said most cases go to hospitals in occupied France.
Only the most serious cases were put off at Berlin.
- Didn't they, Terry?
Mm-hm.
- Berlin?
Let's see.
We got on about 2:30 and the train's averaging 40.
We should be there in about three hours.
Better jump off in the yards when the train slows.
Well, suppose it doesn't slow down?
Heh. Oh, don't worry about me.
- I'll make it.
- He'll be all right.
If we get off soon, we can detour around the city.
Detour, nothing. We're going right in.
No better place to hide than a big city.
Sure, then the kid can rest up for a few days.
- Yeah.
- And we could get some food.
And get in a little constructive destruction.
- Well, if the right chance shows up.
- We'll make the right chance.
- Now, if I can forage some explosives...
- Berlin's full of factories.
- Look at us. We're a five-man invasion.
- That's the way to talk.
We'll be the first invasion to hit Germany since Napoleon.
Except he missed a few things that we won't overlook.
- Look who thinks he's Napoleon.
- Oh. Don't be silly.
I didn't say I was Napoleon.
I said...
- He says he's Napoleon, he's Napoleon.
I didn't say I was Napoleon. l...
Come on, you just take a seat.
Just be seated here.
The rest will do you good.
We'll tell Josephine you're tired.
Quiet, the emperor sleeps.
Hey, Napoleon?
Where'd you put the brandy?
Say, has it occurred to you guys...
...what's gonna happen if we're caught in these uniforms?
Yeah, you're not kidding. Good night.
Hey, drop that curtain.
- Hey, Terry. Rise and shine.
- Hm? What?
Does Goring go for smelly soap.
Eau de violet, so help me.
Hey, what happened to you?
- I'm clean, if that's what you mean.
- I'll say you are. Hey, fellows, look.
He's turned white over night.
You've been holding out on us.
- That thatch of yours is a dye job.
- Why, Grandpa.
I didn't intend for you to discover it, but I had to touch it up.
Sure. Got a face lift, too, didn't you?
This is serious. They don't take men in the service over 39.
If we get back, don't tell the CO.
- I told him I was 38.
Thirty-eight?
You're old enough to be my old man.
Terry kept my secret.
Why won't you fellows?
Sure. Lay off him, fellas.
We ought to have him retired for his own good.
Heh, heh. He's had four years of fighting in the last war.
Ought to have left this one to the young men.
That's what he thought, until he lost his son at Dunkirk.
What are we stopping in the suburbs for?
I don't know.
Better got your things together, quick.
Listen. Shh. Listen.
With this grease, nobody can do anything.
This is nothing but soap water.
Conductor, you are right.
Well, for 25 years, I have been with the railroad company now.
But they've never delivered anything like this to us before.
I wouldn't give this to my dog.
Well, what are you doing in this car?
Will you see that you see that you get out of there?
Looks like we're gonna get the royal roust.
- Should we jump him before he jumps us?
- Keep quiet and leave him to me.
- Tell him you're Napoleon.
- What?
Cut out that Napoleon stuff.
I'll tell him we're on leave...
...in a hurry to see our girls.
- Ask him if he knows any girls.
Aha.
The general staff.
Attention.
Well, you've really made it very cozy here for yourself.
Is there anything I can do for the gentlemen?
- Excuse me, but we thought...
- You're not supposed to think.
Do you cattle happen to know where you are?
In the salon car of the
General Field Marshal Von Goring.
And you cattle have the nerve to act as though were at home.
Now, just look at this mess here.
Well, are you really sure that this is the cigarette that tastes best to you?
- Yes, yes.
- Well, that really makes me very happy.
Pull your bones together, you stuffed pig.
Out with you. All of you.
Or I'll chase you around with a gun...
...so that you won't know whether you're fish or flesh.
Something like this, in my whole life.
Hail, Hitler!
Attention! Search the train.
- Hey, you. Did anybody get off the train?
- Yes, major.
In the salon car of Field Marshal Von
Goring. I found five soldiers.
- I sure kicked them out.
- So, you fool, I chase after these guys...
...for hours and you, ox, let them go.
I'm going to report that. Come on.
Search the station yards.
Not you, you nincompoop.
You've made enough trouble.
I cannot understand that they leave a house like that empty...
...now when thousands of wounded arrive every day from the east.
It could be fixed up for a hospital.
Look, where does that smoke come from?
Not at all bad.
Needs a little something, though.
Kirk, is that really gonna turn out to be something we can eat?
I was famous for the way I cooked my stew at Wipers in November, 1918.
- What happened to the men who ate it?
- Nobody ate.
They used it for explosives.
Germans signed the armistice the next day.
Think they could hold out against my cooking?
How much longer before it'll be done?
It should be ready by the time
Terry gets here with the drinking water.
Well, you better start dishing it out.
Here he comes now.
Search that guy.
Let's see if he's got a revolver on him.
Back up.
Let's see what else you've got on you.
To the wall. Back up.
We're going to show you how to behave.
Obedience, respect. We are going to show you what you have to do.
Ridiculous gang.
Hey, Krauts.
How about giving us a break...?
Back up to the wall.
Well, how was the stew?
It was good.
- I feel up to anything now.
- You do?
Gents, I have a little suggestion to make.
What about a spot of sabotage at the chemische Versuchsanstalt?
What's that, sir?
- Chemical plant. Makes incendiary bombs.
I remember that.
Second objective, night we dumped our load on Stettiner freight yards.
I passed the place on my way to get the beer.
- It's about a half a mile from here.
- So that's what held you up, huh?
Uh-huh. Oh, baby.
What a beautiful fire that's gonna make.
And oh, baby, do I love a beautiful fire.
Imagine the CO's face when we get back and tell him we got it from the ground.
We get the Victoria Cross, each of us with 37 palms.
- At least.
- With a spot of luck.
Suppose we don't have that spot of luck.
It's worth taking a risk to knock off a chemische Versugar...
Whatever you call it.
Why? That's always been a secondary objective.
Information on Messerschmitt factories is important.
We'll get that back, but let's knock off this chemical plant first.
Two jobs at once.
We haven't the right to risk getting back on side issues. Weigh the values.
That's what comes of being a bookkeeper.
Add everything, plus and minus, stick in a decimal point...
...and let it take all the fun out of life.
- Fun?
I didn't get into this war for fun or adventure or because it was expected of me.
I got in because it was a hard, dirty job that has to be done...
...before I can go back to doing what I liked.
Before a hundred million other people can go back to doing what they liked.
It's no bright game to me.
It's just a job.
A job that has to be done as rapidly and as efficiently as possible.
Look, Jed, if you think
I'm playing games...
...well, that's your opinion.
I'm leading you into something desperate.
I know that.
But I figure we've got about one chance in 10,000 of ever getting out of here.
And if we are gonna get knocked off...
...I just want to leave a couple of bouquets behind to be remembered by.
That's all.
Do you wanna put it to the vote?
Never mind.
What's your plan?
I made a sketch of the factory.
There's an iron door leading in the back, right here.
- When does our relief come?
- Oh, in about ten minutes.
That's about time.
The time goes awfully slow tonight.
Detachment. Halt!
Order arms! Forward, march!
Here, try this.
Right.
Lloyd, you stay here and keep watch.
Now, if we don't make it, set fire to these oil drums.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
- Here, take this. You got a match?
- Yes, sir.
Okay. Come on, Johnny.
See, here is the Chemical Experimental Plant.
Put your guards all around, here, here, here and here.
At once, major. Come, Come, don't stand around. Do something.
Come, come. Such a mess.
For two days, these men have been running around free in Berlin.
Light, quick.
I copped a good one, didn't I?
Don't talk now, kid.
Here, put it under his head.
- We've got to get him to a doctor.
- No. No, mustn't.
- You'll all be arrested.
- Don't worry about that.
Don't risk a doctor.
- You'll all be caugh...
- Shh.
- I don't think she heard us.
- No.
Look, I'll scout the neighborhood, try and find a doctor.
Is that all for today, miss?
Do you need anything else?
No, thanks.
- Pardon, miss.
- Where is the nearest doctor?
- Dr. Franz Schneider.
Where is that?
Maasson Street, twenty-nine.
Thank you.
Send him to my uncle.
- One moment, please.
This doctor is out of town.
Go to Dr. Ludwig Mather,
Crown Street 24.
- Yes?
- Excuse me, is Doc...?
- Oh.
- Come in, please.
- You are Englishmen?
- Yes, and desperate.
You're quite safe. In here.
I had the druggist direct you here so that my uncle and I could help you.
How did you know?
He spoke as I passed by your hiding place.
Water. Give me water.
Keep him quiet.
There's a patient in my uncle's office now.
Doctor, here is an emergency case.
Oh. Excuse me, Mrs. Raeder.
- Englishmen, fugitives.
- Shh.
How long ago was he shot?
About half an hour.
Can you help him?
I can try.
I'll get rid of my patient.
So, Mrs. Raeder, that looks already pretty good.
- Shall I come back, doctor?
- This way, please.
Take the bandage off tomorrow and if it's not quite all right...
...come back again.
Good night, Mrs. Raeder, and a speedy recovery.
Thank you, doctor. Good night.
Please, sir, just a glass of water.
Sure, kid. Right here.
Please, sir, some water.
- Good night, miss.
- Good night.
Here you are, kid.
Ooh. Better take it slowly.
How's that? Better?
- Can I help you, doctor?
- No, my niece can assist me.
You'd best wait in the other room.
Mr. Forbes.
- Yes, kid?
- I'm sorry I forgot to dodge those bullets.
- What are you talking about?
Soon as the doctor takes them out, you can wear them on your watch chains for charms.
Would you...?
You'd better not talk any more now, kid.
You're a lucky guy.
I envy you, lying there...
...with a pretty nurse to take care of you and everything.
If this doesn't work out, tell the others good luck.
But you'll be telling them yourself in half an hour.
- You think so?
- Why, sure.
Tell Dad I only had 42 Jerries to go.
You can bring your friends into the outer office if you wish.
You can trust me. You're not the first
I've helped to escape.
Hey, there.
The wound seems to be pretty deep.
Look.
Why don't you tell them, huh?
- Why don't you say what's in your mind?
- Terry, sit down.
We'd all be safe in England if I'd obeyed the skipper's orders.
He'd still be alive if it weren't for me.
Hollis wouldn't be fighting for his life if I hadn't led you on a crazy stunt.
Go on. Go ahead.
- Say it.
- You're in command, Terry.
You did what you thought best.
- We'd have all done the same thing.
- Sure, we would.
You wouldn't have, because you were right and I was wrong.
All right, from now on, you're in command.
When we want a change, we'll ask for it.
We've stuck this far.
We'll stick all the way.
Can I see Dr. Mather?
I'm sorry, but the doctor is busy.
Secret State Police, miss.
In the other room, quick.
Police.
There's a room across the hall.
Where is the soldier who spoke English?
Not in here. The doctor is operating.
Where is the man who brought the soldier in here?
I don't have any idea.
Please, do not disturb me in my work.
Looking for who brought Hollis.
- Answer me, where is the man?
- I don't know.
Stop it! Stop it!
Here, I'll handle this.
Try to get out the back way.
Hey, wait a minute. Let's toss for this.
Leave me alone.
This is a matter of life and death.
If you don't tell me right away where he is, I will break your neck.
Hands up.
- What's he say?
- Hold up your hands.
Hands up.
Ask him, please, to let the doctor finish his work.
I'm the one they're looking for.
That is the man you're looking for.
Tell him to bring his comrade to my car.
He orders you to carry your comrade out to his car.
But I can't do that. The boy will die.
I'll go with him.
But you can't touch the boy now.
- Oh, be quiet! Nobody asked you!
I told you fellows to be on your way.
We know when to disobey orders too.
Gentlemen, your comrade is dead.
I can't thank you enough, both of you.
I am sorry I couldn't save the boy.
I know you did all you could.
Don't worry about the Gestapo men.
We'll dispose of them so that you won't be suspected.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye and good fortune.
Thank you.
I'll be leaving soon for my home in Münster.
If you come that way, my father and I will help you as we've helped others.
- We'll make it a point to come that way.
- The address, 37 Bismarckstrasse.
- My father's name is Herr Brahms.
- Brahms.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
There's some corner of a foreign field
That is forever England.
We make Stendal by dawn.
Let's get moving.
Keep riding.
Halt.
Where to?
Army supplies to Warnsdorf.
Okay. Can pass.
Hey. Where you coming from?
- Good evening, captain. On the way to...
- Help my driver to get my car going.
- Yes, captain. Give a hand.
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come.
Here. You are strong enough for this job.
Oh.
The back wheel here, that's the hardest job...
...you understand?
We must get that out first.
Captain, would you please come out here?
- What do you want from me?
- To look over the damage, captain.
- Something is wrong with the car there.
- Where?
All right. You fellows give her a shove forward and I'll put her in gear.
That a captain of the German air force...
...is fooled that much by fugitive English prisoners, that is too much.
But major, I told you.
They all wore German uniforms.
Yes, yes. One moment, please.
Telephone, captain.
Eggerstedt, air force.
Yes? What? Muenster?
- Imagine. They found my car in Muenster.
- In Muenster?
Call Staaken right away.
Have a plane ready.
Give me Staaken, quick.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.
Excuse me.
Is Miss Kaethe Brahms at home?
I'm very sorry, but my daughter is out of town.
Tell her what she said about helping like she helped others.
Oh, I think I understand.
Come in. Come in.
- Hermann?
Yeah?
These are the gentlemen sent by Kaethe.
Oh, that's fine. I'm Kaethe's father.
Very happy to know you. Forbes.
Glad to know you, sir.
- Forrest.
- You are welcome.
- Hammond.
- Glad to have you.
- Edwards.
- Oh, sure.
- Do I smell food?
- Oh, heh, heh.
That's the first time I ever ate a turkey stuffed with a rabbit.
And I thought Goring was the only man in Germany who had enough to eat.
What do you do, print your own food coupons?
Ration cards don't bother me.
I've been careful...
...to maintain friendship with the highest-placed Nazi in Munster.
That must be a dangerous sort of friendship.
Perhaps. But necessary to continue to work...
...under the very noses of Germany's oppressors.
And I shall continue, for I know that Germany's only hope lies...
...in the defeat of the Nazi armies.
Not so loud.
You'll manage to get us in the concentration camp.
My wife is always afraid of the police.
She thinks even the walls have ears.
Sure.
- No, thank you.
Well, sometimes the waiting is very hard.
I listen on my secret radio.
I hear of the men and planes
America is sending.
Sixty thousand planes a year, I heard.
And it's only the beginning.
Only the beginning.
Oh, wonderful. Wonderful.
But when they make planes so quickly,
I hope they are good.
We've only had squawks from the Messerschmitt.
Oh, fine.
But just to have planes and to drop bombs.
We think it's necessary to invade.
To smash these men right on their own soil.
- Oh, well, we're gonna get around to that.
- Yes, sure, but when?
Well, so far, Winston and Franklin haven't taken us into their confidence.
And the funny thing is they seem to be doing all right without our help.
I don't like to eat and run, but we should be moving.
Most of my guests have been glad of the chance to sleep in good beds.
So would we.
But we got hold of some information...
...we're anxious to get back to England before it cools off.
Oh, I see. I see. Something urgent?
Well, we think it is.
I'll phone to one of my friends who will give you his automobile.
Will you excuse me, please? Thank you.
You're a gay brother.
You look like an old uncle of mine in Potsdam.
- He could eat two schnitzels at once.
- Yes? You?
She's cute, huh? What'd she say?
She said you remind her of an uncle she's got in Potsdam.
He was nuts.
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, yeah?
You'd better eat your strudel.
He'll bust. lt'll be easier for three to get out of the country than four, so here goes.
Oh, ho.
- Kaethe. How nice to see you.
Hello, Kaethe.
- So you did get here safely?
- Yes. How's the doctor?
- Is he all right?
- Fine.
- Your plan worked perfectly.
- Good.
Should have come with us.
- Where's my father?
Outside making telephone arrangements for us.
- He's great.
- He's always glad to do anything.
So here I have nice, hot coffee for you.
Who is this woman? This man?
You mean, you...
They're not your parents?
I've never seen them before in my life.
Who are you? What's your name?
- My name is...
Where's my father and my mother?
What has become of them?
The same that will...
Speak English. Where are they?
Where you all very soon will be.
In a concentration camp.
I was phoning my superior at the local police office.
You'll never see England again.
See who that is, quick.
It's the police.
- Police?
They're all around.
- Any side doors or windows?
None that they can't cover.
- The roof. We can escape over the roof.
- That's it. Come on.
Quick, untie her. Hurry up.
- Where are the Englishmen?
- Ran up to the roof.
Forwards!
- To the roof.
Quick. After them.
- Can you make it?
- I'll try.
All right.
All right. Come on, Kirk.
Kirk. Come on, jump.
Come on, jump.
Kirk.
Come on, jump.
Halt!
Secret State Police, group Muenster!
- Major Baumeister.
- At your command, major.
Where are the Englishmen?
- In number 37. Our men are there.
- Good. You stay here.
At your command.
- Hey. That looks like...
- Yeah. The iron fist.
Don't let them get away. After them.
We must get these guys.
- Kaethe. Where are you going?
- I must leave you here.
Back up the car. First turn to the left.
- What'll happen to you?
- People I know will hide me.
No, you come with us.
- With any luck, we'll reach England.
- No, I must stay here.
And warn those who worked with my father what happened to him.
- Help carry on the work.
- But you've done your share and more.
No one's share will be done till the war is over.
There will be other men, from prison camps...
...the concentration camps, the conquered countries.
It's our job, the job of the underground to return them to the fight.
We must all do our work before we can go back to doing what we like.
- Strange, that's what Jed said.
- Go now. That way.
Take the first road to the left.
It leads to the highway to the Dutch border.
Get to Berghofen. Find Herr Van Paalt.
He will help you.
And when you are across the Channel, tell the people in England...
...that there are people like us left in Germany...
...still living, still hoping, still fighting.
It would be nice to know that they know.
We'll tell them.
Till we meet again.
Goodbye.
Till we meet again.
Goodbye, Kaethe. Thanks.
Car in sight. Barriers down.
- Password.
- Staff our for General von Schlegel.
Are in a hurry.
Can pass. Barriers up.
- We got away with that.
- What did you tell him?
Told him we're a staff car for
General von Schlegel, whoever he is.
Barriers down.
Did a staff car with soldiers pass here?
Yes, major.
About four or five minutes ago.
The occupants were Englishmen.
Have you got motorcycle riders here?
Yes, major. Motorcycle riders.
Quick. Follow that car.
- Hey, Johnny?
Yeah.
Do you see what I see?
First time in my life I wished
I was being tailed by speed cops.
Getting close. Can you get more speed out of this crate?
She's doing all she can now.
Hang on, fellows.
We're going cross-country.
Looks like we lost them.
They're heading us off.
So now.
- What are you doing?
- An old Yankee bootlegger trick.
Let the fellows lie there.
Come on, let's go.
Clear the road.
Drive quicker. It will be your fault if these guys escape us.
There is a telephone.
- Jump off and phone ahead.
- At your command.
Slower.
Telephone connection.
Connect the telephone. Official business.
Yes, sir. Right away.
Hurry up.
Your connection.
Give me post number 14, urgent.
Yes. At your command.
I understand.
It will be done immediately.
Attention. Out. Build up barricades.
Block the street. Let nobody pass.
Attention. Here.
What are you doing there?
Get in the truck.
Block the road.
The rest follow me to the wagon, here.
Lend a hand! Quickly!
Clear the wheels! Fill the gap!
Put the wagon here in this gap!
Take the boxes down.
- Have we lost them?
I think so.
No, look.
Slow down.
Keep at a distance.
- They just seem to be tailing us.
- Don't like the look of it.
Give it full gas.
Hang it all.
You oaf. Couldn't you get through?
Let me out of here.
Hey, if this is what I think it is...
It is.
Well, this is the first time I ever ran out of gas with a couple of guys.
- Did you see that? Gas.
- He's turned off.
Well, what are we waiting for?
What's that?
Hey, that's one of our aircraft.
To the right. To the right.
Stop over there and give a hand here. Help them, will you?
This is the biggest bomb I've ever seen.
It's like the giant Goliath. lt'll blow out the
Battersea Waterworks into a thousand bits.
There is no doubt about it.
Watch out.
Be careful. Watch out. Be careful.
Stop! That's fine.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Hey.
Did I hear him say Battersea Waterworks?
You did. We've gotta stop them before they got started.
Sure. We'll walk out and say,
"We need your gasoline for a car we stole."
When that plane leaves...
...it'll be followed by a mass flight of bombers loaded with incendiaries.
They've been trying to knock off the Battersea Waterworks for two years.
We're steamed up because one plane with one egg will lead the parade.
An English plane, able to come over so low, it can't miss.
Suppose Japs had an American bomber...
...and dropped a 2-ton bomb on the Boulder Dam power plant?
That'd cut off juice from half the
West Coast. But the waterworks...
Supplies half the water for the fires of London.
- Why, the...
- Shh.
- lf I only had a pistol.
- Huh. How about a tank?
A pistol would do.
I could put a slug in that bomb...
...before those Krauts knew what was going on.
We'll get a chance to do something if they break for lunch.
- Why wait? There's only twelve of them.
- Listen.
Wait here.
Schneider. Here is the flight order.
- Have the motors been checked?
- Yes, captain.
Back up the car.
- How is the weather forecast?
- Pretty good.
Put the dogs on the trail.
There were three soldiers here.
Detachment, follow me.
Attention. About face. Forward.
- The field must be smoothed out yet?
- Yes, sir.
- We can start with that in half an hour.
- Yes.
Let the motors warm up.
- Any luck?
- Yeah. Quite a bit. Come over here.
Crew arrived, checked the ship over.
They're getting ready to leave at sunset.
- Where's the luck in that?
- Pilot wants the field smoothed off.
Unteroffizier said he'd get the mechanics, have it cleared in half an hour.
- Leaving the plane unguarded?
- Unguarded enough.
- Supper in England.
- Supper in London.
The finest, most expensive meal in the history of the world.
- Champagne. Buckets of it.
- Yeah. White bread with butter on it.
Lots of butter.
I know a little girl in London.
She's got a sister.
I know a little steak in London with French-fried onions.
I'll swap you the sister for the onions.
You've got a deal, partner.
Hey, look. Is that the gasoline truck?
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
That's it, boys. Can't wait for them to fix that field. Come on.
The work here cannot last very long.
No, captain.
In one hour everything will be done.
Well, here goes. Good luck.
Fill up these two holes here first.
No, there. A little further there. Yes.
The weather is pretty favorable today.
Yes, I have not yet flown an American plane...
...but that won't make any difficulty for us.
- Hey. What do you want there?
Hey, stop!
- Halt.
Halt.
What's that?
There they are. Shoot them down.
Spread out.
- Take over the guns, Johnny.
Okay.
Messy, but lucky.
Bad enough to put him in a hospital...
...and light enough to make him dangerous for the nurses.
- Hey, how's for swinging south, Terry?
- Huh? South?
Give them back their demo bomb in the harbor at Vlissingen.
Terry, no detours now.
He's right, Johnny. No detours.
You can dump that bomb when we get over the Channel.
Okay.
See if you can get England on the wireless, will you?
Lockheed Hudson GK calling 83 Control.
- Mr. O'Connor, sir.
- Yes?
Aircraft calling on our waveband.
- Not one of ours?
- No.
Have him identify himself.
Control calling Hudson GK.
Lockheed Hudson GK calling 83 Control.
- Are you receiving me?
- You are coming in very weak.
Please, identify yourself.
Please, identify yourself. Over.
Flight Lieutenant Forbes, Flying Officer
Forrest, Flying Officer John Hammond.
Returning in recaptured Lockheed Hudson with markings GK. Over. Over.
- Hold him. Group Captain Coswick, sir?
Yes? What is it?
We're getting a report from someone who claims to be Terry Forbes.
- Forbes?
- Hammond's with him...
...in a recaptured Hudson.
- I'd given him up.
Where are they?
Giving his position now.
Put it on the amplifier.
Can now see Channel ahead of us.
- That's Forbes.
Give me the microphone.
Estimate we'll be over
North Bank Lightship at 1625 hours...
...height 5,000 feet.
Better have an ambulance standing by, sir.
Forrest caught a nicko.
And will you have two steaks ready, please, medium rare?
Oh, yes. Flying Officer Hammond would like the waitress well done.
Operator, switch me over.
Forbes, this is the CO speaking.
Yes, sir?
Hey, Johnny? Just a moment, sir.
Johnny?
- Did you let that bomb go?
- Yeah, I must be out of practice.
- I missed the Channel.
- What?
I dropped it right on that battery of big guns...
...that's been placed at Dover. Sorry.
Excuse the interruption, sir.
That's right, sir. Flight Lieutenant Forbes,
Flying Officer Forrest...
...Flying Officer Hammond of Fortress
D for Danny, mission completed.
Terry. Jed.
- England.
Yeah.
Now for Australia and a crack at those Japs.
To the rear, march! To the rear, freeze!
Forward! To the right flank, freeze!
Forward! Platoon, halt.
At ease.
What was that number in Paris?
All heads up. Right face.
Forward march.
Extend. Hut!
Swing right. Hut!
"Merry Christmas." That's a crock.
Beats those replacement camps.
You said the war would be over by Christmas.
What do you want, egg in your beer?
Here we are, two hours from Paris.
The spitting image of Camp Wolters, Texas.
You know, they got a man in the army.
A two-star general.
But all he does is fly around in a private plane looking for ugly places.
Flat, sandy places. No trees, no water.
Then he checks up on the climate.
If it's too hot in summer for human life and too cold in winter... and if it has more rain, fog, wind, and snow... than any other spot he can find, then he plants the American flag... and proclaims it a US Army camp.
Did they drill that way at Camp Wolters?
Bombshell.
Box steps.
To the rear, freeze! Forward!
To the right flank, freeze!
Forward! Platoon, halt!
At ease!
Forty-two sixty what?
- Forty-two sixty-ten.
- Seventy!
Platoon, attention. Right face.
Forward march!
The Screaming Eagle.
They know who you are when you wear that on your sleeve.
It wasn't bad enough being in Infantry Replacement.
We have to volunteer for the 101st Airborne.
You go in gliders instead of trucks.
That's the only difference.
There must be a difference or they wouldn't give you extra pay.
Hooper, I don't think
I'll take in that movie tonight.
I'll be kind of busy getting acquainted and sewing on shoulder patches.
Why did they have to put us in different companies?
- Lf we ask them, they might do something.
- No. There's another major general.
His job is to find out who your buddy is and then to split you up.
- Don't forget, I'm in K Company.
- I won't.
And don't you forget, I'm in I Company.
Third platoon, second squad.
So long, Hooper.
Thanks.
Remember that lieutenant in Normandy... who said he'd court-martial the first man who tossed his gas mask away?
We ripped out the masks... and used the carriers for toting that cognac we liberated.
"Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday."
- Hiya. How did you make out?
- The lights were pretty bad... but I was really flipping them in there.
Six completed passes.
- I'll be hot in that game tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? You ain't going to Paris?
Him? He'd rather play football than eat.
With the chow we've been getting,
I don't blame him. But Paris...
It's gonna be lonesome here.
The whole platoon's going.
All except the replacements.
- Sgt. Wolowicz?
- Yeah?
My name is Layton.
I've been assigned to your squad.
Make yourself at home, but on some other sack.
- That one's mine.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Li'I Abner in Paris.
Boy, that's gonna be something.
Daisy Mae won't know you when you get back to Dogpatch.
That's for dang sure.
Abner, will you please stop saying that?
Fellows, look what I found.
- Holley.
- The Purple Heart kid.
At ease, men.
I heard the war was on its last legs, so I thought I'd come back.
Rough in the ETO.
A little scratch on his leg... and a month later he comes back in time for a three-day pass to Paris.
It was misery in that hospital, Kipp.
Passes every night, champagne, I'amour.
And me brooding all the time about my dear buddies back there... defending the Republic.
Will you look at that girl bait.
I'm getting me a mess of that fruit salad just as soon as we hit Paris.
You can have the sack next to me.
Nobody's got it, have they?
No, I was just sitting here.
- That's a nice-looking little girl.
- It's a boy.
What's it like, Holley?
- Paris?
- Yeah.
I spent my spare time in the art galleries.
But I happened to hear about a place that might interest you. Place Pigalle.
Pig Alley.
Be sure to bring your dog tags, because one night in Pig Alley...
Excuse me.
Because you're going to think you're the Caliph of Baghdad.
You guys talk about Piccadilly Circus.
Compared to Pig Alley, it's like the quiet room in a limey YMCA.
How about you and me boarding up in Paris?
What's the matter, did Pop Stazak disown you?
Pop can't go on account of his arthritis.
I love you, Roderigues. I love all of you.
But I'm getting me a private room and private bath in Paris... if I have to get it at the point of a gun.
The big brain wants to get away from us common people.
He hasn't got anybody around here to chat with about the Einstein Theory.
What do you mean? He's got me.
There ain't nothing we like to talk about better.
What happened to Lt. Belwick?
He was just your speed, Joe College.
He got hit in Holland.
It's all right, kid. Go right ahead.
Just brush me off when you're through.
- Holley, my boy, bonjour.
- Hiya. What are you busting out about?
It's nothing at all, son.
It's hardly worth mentioning.
They're just making me a civilian, that's all.
- They what?
- I wish I had arthritis.
It ain't the arthritis.
They got a report from the Red Cross... that my wife is too sick to take care of the kids.
So I let them talk me into accepting a dependency discharge.
Glad you made it, Pop.
Who's gonna adopt Roderigues?
He'd be lost without his Popsy Wopsy.
One of these days you're going to get a GI bootsie wootsie... right square in those GI teeth.
Such language. You should have learned him better manners, Pop.
- Knock it off, will you?
- When do you leave?
Any day now. I have to sweat out a letter of confirmation... from our higher headquarters.
You'll be in Paris.
No, I decided to catch that football game.
That's swell. It'll be rugged waiting around here all alone.
See you in the morning, Johnny.
You gonna miss me, Abner?
That's for dang sure.
I'm glad to see you guys finally got the junk off my cot.
How about dousing that light?
Paris trucks are leaving early.
Okay, douse it.
All right, roll out of them sacks.
Hit it.
Leave your cots and grab your socks.
Let's go, men. You're slow.
Get them up, Wolowicz.
- I ain't going to Paris.
- Nobody's going to Paris.
- We're moving up. On trucks.
- Moving up? Where to?
Beats me. The Krauts made a breakthrough someplace.
They tell me it's gonna be cold... so wear your long johns and two pairs of pants. Three, if you can get them on.
But they told us yesterday we'd be off the line for good.
They didn't get the order till after midnight.
There's trucks this time instead of gliders.
That's a good sign, anyway.
This is strictly for the birds, brother.
Beats anything ever I stuck my finger in before.
"General, I need a crack division to plug up that gap."
"A crack division, General?
I'd be honored if you'd use the 101st."
"Awfully nice of you, old boy.
Thanks a lot."
"Not at all, General."
Maybe the adjutant can put in a phone call.
Yeah. It's only a technicality.
- I forgot to tell you, men...
- Shut up!
It's a secret move, so rip off your shoulder patches.
Sarge, you got any of them rubber overshoes, them galoshes?
Can't fit you, Abner. Your feet's too small.
Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday.
Yeah, if you can find some cognac.
- No dice?
- I gotta wait for the letter. Regulations.
It's gonna be a cold trip.
Maybe you can ride in the driver's cab.
Wind it up.
Let's get this show on the road.
- That the new platoon leader?
- Yeah, fresh off the boat.
I understand your problems, men.
- I used to be an enlisted man myself.
- For six months, maybe.
And 17 weeks at OCS, and he's an officer and gentleman...
- by special act of Congress.
- Sound off!
Shut up!
- What did he say? Where are we?
- Are you kidding?
Do you speak French, sir?
Yes. Immediately.
- Cigarette?
- Thank you very much.
I don't smoke, but thanks anyway.
Thanks a lot.
What time is it, Hansan?
- What?
It can't be that late. We left at 2:00.
- Near lunchtime in Springfield.
- You never changed your watch?
What's the use of changing your watch?
What's the use? You're here, you're not in Springfield, Illinois.
I hear you.
This is what I like about the infantry.
You always know just what's going on.
How do you like this guy?
He don't like the infantry.
- Must be off his nut.
- He never had it so good.
He found a home in the Army.
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?
Chocolate, please.
Isn't she cute?
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?
Here.
Get a load of mama!
I'd like to keep her in chocolate for about a week.
What's she saying, Jarvess?
She wants to know if we'd like to come inside and warm up.
- Yes. Warm up, please.
- Oh, brother!
- I like these secret moves.
- We sure slipped one over on the Krauts.
How do they find out these things?
Who tells them?
- I keep them posted. Short wave.
- Somebody does.
They only occupied France for four years.
Naturally they left a few spies when they pulled out.
That's an idea.
Why don't us Gls hire some spies... so we'll know what's going on once in a while?
Get them inside! Come on!
On the double!
Kinnie, how about getting these men in out of the hot sun?
Wolowicz, Garby, in there with the second platoon.
This corner house.
I forgot to tell you.
Put those shoulder patches back on.
- Pop, I hear we're bedding down here.
- Overnight?
Yeah. Looks like a good house, too.
Smoke coming out of the chimney.
For once, we get a break.
Bastogne. I won't be forgetting this place in a hurry.
I wouldn't mind holing up here till Christmas.
I hear tell we might.
All the rumors is good ones.
This is the United States Armed Forces
Radio Service broadcasting from London.
Let's see if we can get some news.
- What's he selling?
- Wait till he slows down.
Ask her. I'll guarantee you she can sprechen sie Deutsch.
Let's live a little, Jarvess.
- Come on, mama, get yourself in gear.
- No, not mama.
These two little children, they live with me, but...
Slowly, please.
She said she's not the mother of the two little girls.
They're from a town near here.
Bombed out, both parents killed.
They all got a sob story.
- Let's cut a rug, Denise. Danser?
- No, we've cut enough.
You gotta keep paying these taxi dancers.
Fork over another chocolate bar.
What you say, please?
I said do you think the rain'll hurt the rhubarb?
What he say?
Is there any coffee left?
- Yes, plenty of coffee. Immediately.
- Thank you.
Anything you want.
Sure, as long as you pay for it.
They're all alike here.
Yes, they're all alike, Kipp.
Scared, hungry, lonely.
Come on, stop beating your gums.
Let a guy get some sleep.
Yeah, it's about that time.
We sure come a far piece today.
- You okay, Kipp?
- Okay.
Poor tired soldiers.
- You want?
- Thank you.
I go now?
I guess so. I'm all beat-up.
It never fails.
Every time you meet a pretty babe... you're either out on your feet or you get the order to move.
- What you say, please?
- Nothing.
- Thank you very much.
- All right.
Good night.
- Where are you going?
- Guard.
What did she say?
She said she's gonna hide the chocolate from the kids till Christmas.
I wish I knew for sure we'd be here tomorrow.
- You'll be here.
- Are you sure?
All we do is lie around till the fog lifts... so the air corps can come out and win the war for us.
In that case, I guess I'll take a chance.
This may go down in history as the greatest gamble of the war.
- Good night, Denise.
- Good night, soldier.
Wolowicz, are you absolutely sure?
Yeah, the C.O. Told us himself.
Wake me up early, will you?
Maybe.
I ought to report this to the Inspector General.
There's supposed to be 18 inches between bunks.
This is dangerous, spreads germs.
There's some hot coffee on the stove.
I can use it.
Don't worry about that plane.
It's one of ours, I think.
Halt. Password.
- Hamburgers.
- Onions.
I thought the 101st was the only division here.
They will be as soon as the rest of us can get out.
- What's up?
- We were a little over to the east.
Been there for weeks without firing a shot.
Then they started coming.
Tanks, planes. Everything you ever heard of and then some.
A Jerry plane turned on a loudspeaker in English.
It said Hitler will give Paris to the Germans for a Christmas present.
But they told us it was just a weak little counterattack.
They'll probably tell you that this is a strategic withdrawal.
- Good morning, soldier.
- Bonjour.
I'll be back in a minute.
Keep an eye on... What's going on?
Me and Gen. McAuliffe decided to move
I Company up on the line.
- That is, if you agree.
- I should have known better.
Maybe she'll give you a refund on those chocolate bars.
How much time have I got?
Ten minutes? Five minutes?
Anything you gotta do, you better do in 30 seconds.
Saddle up. Let's go, Holley.
Drop your packs and rolls.
Third platoon, on your feet.
We've got that patch of woods to clear.
Third platoon, any time there's a dirty detail.
Let's not be having any talk like that, soldier.
Let's go.
Keep sight of the man on each side of you.
Watch out for snipers.
Snipers, the man says.
Second squad, over here. Dig in.
You're in charge till I get back.
I'm going to see the Lieutenant.
- Don't go volunteer for any patrols.
- Who do I dig with, Sergeant?
That's right, we've got an odd man.
You can triple up with me and Hansan.
- Thanks. You want me to go with you?
- No, you stay and get the hole started.
Come on, Hansan, let's go.
Take ten, Jarvess.
Time for me to spare you.
Get out of here.
I'm sorry.
Let's not try to reach China this time.
There's no sense digging if you don't go deep.
Last time we dug one together... you went so deep that when I climbed out
I got the bends.
- How does it look?
- Great.
Only one thing wrong. We're moving.
- What?
- You heard me. It ain't my idea.
Saddle up, everybody, let's go.
Oh, no!
Just once I'd like to dig a foxhole... and find out that's the one I'm sleeping in.
Will you stop yapping?
First and third squads gotta run patrols all night.
- All we gotta do is...
- Standiferd, take over.
- I'm pulling the first shift on the roadblock.
- Okay.
You better take a blanket with you.
This fog... really gets to you.
I feel kind of woozy myself.
Let's go, Hansan.
Just get it started. We'll finish it up.
When you were in that camp in New York...
- did you ever phone your wife?
- Sure.
- What did it cost?
- A nickel. What did you think?
That's right. She came there to see you.
Did you phone your kids long distance?
Yeah, just before we shipped out.
- Why?
- What did that cost?
$2 for three minutes.
- Why, Johnny?
- I was thinking... it's probably about as far from New York to Wichita, where your kids were... as it is from Wichita to Los Angeles, where my folks are.
And when you get back home... what would that be, about 200 francs?
I'll send you a bill, Johnny.
Tell them that I...
Well, you'll think of something.
And if it runs over three minutes, it's okay.
Put out that fire. It's getting dark, Holley.
Put on that steel pot and get over to the roadblock.
Three on a shift at night:
You, Kipp, and the new man.
They said to look out for Krauts wearing GI uniforms.
What about the password?
That might be nice to know, in case somebody thinks we're Krauts.
- Bug-jitter.
- Thanks.
Here, don't get any dirt in these eggs.
Okay, you get half of them.
- How do you feel, Standiferd?
- Terrible.
It's settling down in my chest.
I'm almost sure I have a fever.
I had a fever in Holland, but the medics wouldn't let me off the line.
You have to have 102. That's a regulation.
Listen to that voice. I can hardly talk.
Yeah, it sounds good.
Halt! Password!
- Bug.
- Jitter.
- What is this, Charlie Company?
- No, sir, ltem.
I Company?
This must be the road to Neufchateau.
- I think it is.
- You want to be sure of things, soldier.
- Is there a bridge up ahead?
- Yes, about half a mile out.
Good. Let's go.
Smart cookie. Wearing his bars on patrol.
Must be a new replacement.
Don't let that happen again.
Speak English.
Yes, sir.
Oh, no!
Look, Pop, it's snowing!
I never saw snow up close before.
It's beautiful.
You didn't, by any chance hear... that it's kind of cold and a little on the wet side, did you?
Man, it's really coming down.
Well, close the window, Johnny, and fix that hole in the roof.
You should know better than to take off your boots in a foxhole.
You might want to start running fast.
- I can't sleep with wet boots on.
- Then wear your galoshes until they dry.
I ain't got no galoshes.
- Where did you get those branches?
- Where do you generally get branches?
- I didn't know if the woods were cleared.
- Yeah, sure. K Company's in there.
- K Company?
- Yeah.
I got a buddy in K Company.
- Is this K Company?
- Yeah.
- Where will I find Hooper?
- Hooper? Never heard of him.
Bill Hooper. I know he's in K Company.
He's not in my platoon.
That first hole is the company C.P.
- They'll know where he is.
- Thanks.
What platoon is Hooper in,
William J. Hooper?
Nobody by that name in K Company.
Yes, there is. He came in with the new replacements just the other day.
That was his name? Hey, Sergeant.
What's up?
That kid they got at last night, name is Hooper. William J. Hooper.
Now I can finish making out my morning report. Thanks.
Direct hit on his foxhole. A mortar.
You don't hear them coming.
You don't know what hit you.
You didn't even know his name.
We didn't even find his dog tags.
Chatsburg News.
Li'I Abner gets one: The Dogpatch Gazette.
I'll take it.
- Sorry, Pop.
- It'll probably come up in the next batch.
You act as if I want a discharge.
Man, I like it here.
Stick around, Kinnie. We're going to choose up sides for a snowball fight.
Hand these letters out with the rations, Hansan.
They're all dinner, for once without coffee.
Dinner rations, with that vitamin-packed lemonade powder:
"Simply add water and serve ice-cold. Delicious."
- About that patrol, Kinnie...
- I can't let you go on it, Wolowicz.
I want to be sure you'll be around to take over the platoon if I have to go back.
My feet froze up pretty bad last night.
I want three volunteers to go out on a patrol.
You, you, and you.
You're in charge, Holley.
Why am I always volunteering for patrol?
- I'm just a cowboy.
- All right, this is the deal, Holley.
G-2 says the Krauts dropped some paratroops last night.
And they might be hiding in that patch of woods on the other side of that farm.
G-2. Wonderful how they always know what's cooking.
Well, I can tell you something they do know.
Last night, some Krauts in GI uniforms infiltrated right through this area.
They blew up a bridge on the road to Neufchateau.
Was one of them wearing lieutenant bars?
- How did you know?
- We get all the latest rumors.
Rumor, my eye.
They captured one of them.
Spoke English perfect. Knew our password, plan of deployment, everything.
Kinnie, how about showing me the way to the aid station?
I'm freezing.
- Feeling any better?
- Worse. Much worse.
Never felt so sick in my life.
Maybe I've even got pneumonia.
He's really bad.
Yeah, he's a cinch to go back to the field hospital. Maybe even to Paris.
I don't know. That penicillin...
He's liable to be back in a day.
Yeah, a good, clean flesh wound is better.
Then they got to send you back.
No, thanks. I don't smoke.
Guys get sick, guys get wounded, and nothing ever happens to me.
Nothing except that time you broke your faux choppers.
It was when you were back. Kipp found out you can't keep a man on the line... unless he's got at least six teeth of his own.
I didn't know about that.
So he broke his GI teeth with the butt of his rifle.
I ran into a tree trunk in the dark.
He was off the line for two weeks getting a new set made.
Let's get this patrol on the road.
That's incoming mail.
Holley, I think your eggs are about done.
We've had good deals before, but this is the best one yet.
This is great. I don't ever wanna go back.
I found a home in the Army.
Of course, you can see snow from LA.
Way off in the mountains.
They got us zeroed in.
I'm getting out of here.
I hope he makes it. They should never have sent him back on the line.
Some guys just can't take it.
Wolowicz, there's something
I want you to know.
My name is Layton.
- I know it is.
- I just wanted to be sure.
Thanks.
This is what G-2 calls a patch of woods.
A whole division could be hiding in that forest.
Nice job for a three-man patrol.
Yeah, if we don't get back, that's how they'll know we ran into some Krauts.
- What's the password?
- Texas.
Keep them covered. They may be German.
- Any line on these woods, Major?
- I didn't hear the countersign.
Leaguer. Texas Leaguer.
Will this road take us to Third Bat headquarters?
- Straight ahead.
- Get going.
- Just a minute. What is a Texas leaguer?
- How's that?
- I said what's a Texas leaguer?
- It's some kind of baseball term.
- What kind?
- A safe hit just over the infielder's head...
Nobody asked you.
How'd the Dodgers make out?
- Who's your commanding officer?
- He knows how the Dodgers made out.
- Let's see your dog tags.
- What?
We're not taking any chances.
What is this?
What kind of nonsense...
Drop those rifles.
- Who's Betty Grable going with?
- Cesar Romero.
- Quiet. Who's the Dragon Lady?
- She's in Terry and the Pirates.
- What's a hotrod?
- A hopped-up jalopy.
- Joe, what do you know?
- Just got back from a vaudeville show.
- I guess they're okay.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
PFC, Major. Praying For Civilian.
That's why I believe in being careful.
May I suggest, sir, that you study up on baseball?
I guess I'd better.
By the way, you might tell your buddy that Cesar Romero is out.
She's married to Harry James.
Let's go.
They really should have sent out a bigger patrol.
- Lf you want to goof off...
- Who said anything about goofing off?
Nobody.
I'm just saying the best way is to tell them... you heard voices talking in German.
Let's say we heard voices talking in Japanese and let G-2 figure that out.
That paper any good?
Best in the world. Sedalia News.
Keep your gloves off for two minutes and you'd have Popsicles instead of fingers.
Get a load of this.
"Our Changing Times, by Mrs. Donald Jarvess...
"pinch-hitting for your favorite columnist and her favorite husband...
"now on active duty, US Army."
You knew I worked on a newspaper.
Yeah, but a column?
You must be pretty good.
I was too good. I wrote a piece about the real meaning of the war... the fight against Fascism, why every
American had to get in there and pitch in.
The logic was magnificent.
You couldn't resist it.
The next thing I knew,
I was in a troop train... waving bye-bye to my wife.
- Came the dawn?
- Yeah.
Only one thing gets me.
When you work on a newspaper...
I'd get those wire releases... and know that I was the first person in town who had the news. All the news.
I'll guarantee you, my wife knows what's going on in Bastogne.
All I know is what's happening to the second squad... in the third platoon of I Company.
Watch this one.
Strike!
Can't hit them if you can't see them.
Now the count's three and two.
Man on first and third.
Two out. This is the one that counts.
Foul ball. Come on, let's have a fast one.
Burn it in, boy. Come on.
A hit right over second base.
There, the center fielder made a shoestring catch. You're out.
- How about it, ump?
- Sound off, pal. Password?
Don't you get it? Right over second base.
- Texas.
- Leaguer.
- You in charge?
- No, the lieutenant.
Hiya, fellows.
What's the situation, Lieutenant?
Nothing but pine trees in these woods.
We've been through them.
- I guess our mission's accomplished.
- Courtesy of K Company.
You can tell them to stop worrying about this area.
Them and us both, Lieutenant. Thanks.
- I guess we might as well partie.
- So long.
- So long.
- So long, fellows.
Come on, on the double. They're Krauts.
Come on!
Kraut tanks!
No. Take off, will you?
If they think we're all getting away, maybe I've got a chance.
- Go on.
- We'll send a patrol back.
- Don't forget the sulfa powder.
- Go on, get in there.
Let's go.
- You're sure they were enemy tanks?
- We saw them, Lieutenant.
Think we've got enough antitank grenades to do any good?
We ain't got any.
Mind if I make a suggestion, Lieutenant?
What?
Sir, our usual defense against tanks is to call for artillery... and then run like a jackrabbit.
We've got orders to hold these positions.
All right, sir, but let's call for artillery and keep our heads down.
We could send out some bazooka men, if we had any bazookas.
- Put in a call for artillery.
- Yes, sir.
What a break.
Artillery's got that farmhouse zeroed in.
Concentration 17.
Item three to ltem:
Kraut tanks by burning farmhouse.
Concentration 17.
Roger. Start the fireworks.
That's great. Artillery can't miss.
They've got Roderigues to use for an aiming stick.
Tell Wolowicz to send out for Roderigues as soon as this barrage lifts.
With what, a sponge?
I've got to get me a rifle.
Any extra ones, Garby?
No, we haven't had any casualties yet.
There's a rifle waiting for you, Holley.
Your squad sent for the meat wagon after the last shelling.
- Who was hit, Doc?
- Wolowicz.
Is he bad?
A shell landed right on the edge of his foxhole.
His shoulder's like a sieve.
- Where's your steel pot, soldier?
- I lost it, Sergeant.
You can try mine on for size... Sergeant.
You're in charge now.
Leadership. That's what I got.
Where's Roderigues?
He'll be along, Pop.
Should have worn my shoulder pads.
In a couple of months you'll be flipping those forward passes as good as ever.
Yeah, left-handed.
He's a good man, Holley... but still a little jumpy.
He can move in with me.
You could do worse.
He sleeps warm and quiet.
His name's Layton. Jim Layton.
- So long, Wolowicz.
- Take it easy.
Say hello to Standiferd.
- Hansan, you can move in with Pop.
- What about Roderigues?
Is that incoming mail?
No, it's outgoing.
There'll be plenty more of it.
- What time is it, Hansan?
- 10:30. No, it must be 11:30 here.
Where's Roderigues?
Let's take a walk, Pop.
How much longer are they going to leave him out there?
Let's partie.
We can carry him back in this blanket.
I want three volunteers.
It's a long walk, Pop.
- I need a fourth for bridge.
- I'll be the dummy.
You don't have to, Layton.
Maybe you'll find some more eggs.
What are you looking for, Kipp, your discharge?
- I lost my teeth.
- You lost them?
They were searching me on a roadblock, so I put them in my pocket.
- And they jumped out?
- Dropped out.
I hope it's nice and warm back where you're going.
I can't chew on K rations with my gums.
No! Keep your eye open.
He used to see snow way off in the mountains.
They say it's just like going to sleep.
He was a religious kid.
When anyone got hit... he used to say it was God's will.
- What's the Bulge?
- Search me.
"Hitler's mighty counteroffensive swept on yesterday under a news eclipse...
"from which filtered the fact that German armor had plunged 20 miles into Belgium."
We're in Belgium, aren't we?
Thought it was Luxembourg.
Let's see that.
"War Department authorities report that morale is high all along the front.
"Battle-hardened doughboys fresh from epic-making triumphs..."
Skip the commercial, Jarvess.
"Air activity was halted by thick, swirling fog.
"At Bastogne, the 101st Airborne..."
Hey, that's us.
Then you'll be proud to know that you are making a heroic stand...
"hurling back the best that Von Rundstedt can throw at you."
- Who's Von Rundstedt?
- A Kraut general. The best they've got.
Is the 101st the only division up here?
It doesn't say.
We'll have to wait for the next edition.
- Where's Pop Stazak?
- Him and Hansan are on a roadblock.
Well, this might be it. It looks official.
Chatsburg News.
And The Dogpatch Gazette.
Get back to the aid station, Kinnie, before those feet of yours get any worse.
They won't take frozen feet unless they start to change color.
No combat fatigue, no fever cases.
You have to be bleeding from a wound.
All they got at the aid station is aspirin and iodine.
- What about the field hospital?
- Captured.
Medics, casualties, equipment, the works.
It must have been after the meat wagon got there with Wolowicz.
I guess Standiferd was there, too.
Some of the walking wounded were killed.
They say the fight they put up was one for the book.
Layton, you're learning too fast.
How about spelling me for a bit?
The dreams are getting better all the time.
I was back home in Baltimore...
Ioading up on hard-shell crabs and beer.
That dream's against regulation, soldier.
You know what our boys overseas always dream about.
- Mom's blueberry pie.
- Why, certainly!
That's what we're fighting for.
Boy, when I get home... just give me a hot dog and a slice of that pie.
Am I gonna kick if I don't get my job back?
No sirree. All I want is a...
So long, Holley.
So long, Pop.
- Au revoir.
- I found them!
I found them in another pocket!
You're just in time to work Pop's shift.
Go up and get Hansan.
- Where you going?
- Special Orders, Number 1437:
"Private Ernest J. Stazak will proceed to Paris...
"where transportation to the US will be arranged."
- Relax, chum. You ain't going no place.
- I ain't?
Here, read it yourself.
I don't care what it says.
Nobody's leaving Bastogne, and nobody's coming in... except maybe some Krauts riding tanks.
We're surrounded.
Surrounded?
If this is one of your crummy jokes...
I'll knock those GI teeth right down your throat.
Take it easy, Pop.
He wouldn't have those teeth back in his mouth if there was any way out.
Tough break, Pop.
You know,
I can get them in a lot of trouble for this.
It's against the rules of war to shoot at civilians.
I'm sorry, Kipp.
Them poor devils in the footslogging infantry... nothing but walk, walk, walk.
The airborne, that's the life.
It's great up here in these gliders, drifting along over the clouds.
They're liable to have you up in juvenile court for smoking.
This your first time away from home, Layton?
Basic training was.
That wasn't quite the same.
My folks stayed for a while at a town near camp.
Did Mama rub your little footsies after those nasty 20-mile hikes?
She made me brush my teeth twice a day... so I wouldn't have to have them all pulled out.
- Hey, look at that.
- What?
I thought it was a shadow.
It's just some burnt-out powder.
You'll die of old age before you see a shadow around here.
This fog ain't never gonna lift.
Did the planes have to wait?
Haven't they ever heard of flying blind?
Nobody cares. They just don't care.
I don't believe that, Kipp.
Reverend Layton will now lead us in prayer.
Might not be a bad idea.
The C.O. Says you're to dig in at that railroad embankment.
The rest of the company's moving back 500 yards.
Right.
Third platoon, whenever there's a dirty detail.
Let's go, men. On your feet.
Check your rifles. See if they're froze up.
Listen to Holley, making a noise like a sergeant.
He's really GI now since he took over the squad. Right on the ball.
Yeah. Strictly chicken, that's me.
Let's be chicken those bolts.
Check your rifles.
Why can't they pass down some information?
If a man gets hit, he must at least know what country he's dying in.
Now, that's for sure. That's for dang sure.
I've asked you 800 times...
I won't say that no more, Jarvess.
That's for sure.
Can't see them.
I'm with you, Holley.
Come on.
Second squad! You, too, Mac! Follow me!
Let's go, Abner!
Mama.
Wait till it clears.
Hold your fire.
Tell them to come out with their hands up.
Layton, you and Joe check them for maps and papers.
See if any of them are still kicking.
Get the prisoners and wounded back to Bastogne, Sergeant.
See if we've got enough men left, Holley.
I'm going to put this man in for a Silver Star.
You know, a guy ought to be able to get
$100 for this back in Paris.
I thought Holley was running away.
That's why I ran after him.
How do you know what Holley was thinking?
How do you know if he was thinking at all?
Things just happen.
Afterwards you try to figure out why you acted the way you did.
I know why I ran. I was scared to death.
You just joined the biggest club in the Army. Everybody belongs.
Just drop me off at the psycho ward.
Why did I have to get up and start firing?
A good thing somebody did.
Yeah. It didn't have to be me. A volunteer.
It happened so fast, you had no time to look at your watch.
Yeah, sure forgot what time it was in Springfield.
- Hansan, I hate to ask you, but...
- You can have it.
Let's get out of here, chum.
Thanks, Pop.
I'll drop back later.
Just don't get carried back.
Say, miss, how about giving him a shot?
Morphine. Him.
No more morphine?
That's great.
She pours him one more,
I'm gonna get myself shot.
They're way too big.
I wished we'd found them yesterday.
Let's go, men. Chow!
- What?
- You heard me. Hot chow!
I've been pulling KP ever since.
We was bombed out twice.
I'm telling you,
I never saw so much incoming mail.
Yeah, things are getting rough all over.
I wanted to go back on the line.
But they're short-handed in the kitchen, see.
A couple more KPs got hit this morning.
I wouldn't mind a little action for a change.
How about you and me switching?
Oh, no. They'd never let me go.
I've been learning how to cook.
- Bettis, anything left?
- No.
But it's clean. It's only leftovers.
I don't even see those things.
I wanna see them.
I wanna remember them.
We'll start back in about an hour.
Better stick around this area.
Where's the kid?
Who, Layton? He's in the barn, I guess, putting on those dry clothes.
Bettis, how about breaking loose with a bottle of cognac?
We ain't got any.
I'll settle for some hot water to wash my feet in.
Coming right up.
Bettis, you got any trading material?
The belly robber keeps everything locked.
But there's half a loaf of bread.
A half a loaf is...
Where is it?
I could have sworn it was on that table.
Hello, soldier.
Pull up a chair, Holley.
Today you are a man.
This is Antwerp, up here.
To the north and the east are the British and the Canadians.
Down at Belfort, over 300 miles away, is the French First Army.
The Americans are stretched out all the way in between.
If the supply line to Antwerp is cut... at least 20 Allied divisions will be strictly out on a limb.
- Where's Bastogne?
- There.
This is where the Krauts found a soft spot in our line.
You see why Bastogne is so important.
It's at the main intersection of seven main highways... one of them leading straight to Antwerp.
Don't know if we can hold out.
That sounds like ours.
It is ours!
Can't see a thing.
The supplies they've got to drop, we wouldn't want.
A crate of eggs for Berlin.
If bombers can get through, why can't C-47s?
In this pea soup?
- They're flying way over, you know that.
- The air corps.
London this morning,
Berlin this afternoon. Headlines tomorrow.
Fellows, come on back.
It's getting lonesome here!
Nobody cares. They just don't care.
You can say that again.
I thought they had us surrounded.
Halt.
I speak English. Who is here in command?
I am here in command.
We have a message for the commanding general.
I'll get a jeep and take the officers back.
Blindfold them.
Try it again, Jarvess.
All I can get out of them is their name and rank.
Loosen up, chum. Give us the lowdown.
You can talk now. Hitler kaput.
How would you like some nice K rations?
Now we're getting somewhere.
He says he'll talk for a pack of cigarettes.
What did he say?
They want us to surrender.
"Surrender or be killed," he says.
Us?
Tell him to go take a flying leap at a rolling doughnut.
The Major thinks General McAuliffe must have misunderstood.
We've appealed to the well-known American humanity... to save the people of Bastogne from further suffering.
We have given you two hours to consider before raining destruction upon you.
We do not understand
General McAuliffe's answer.
I'll be glad to repeat it.
The answer is, "Nuts!"
Is that a negative or an affirmative reply?
"Nuts" is strictly negative.
We will kill many Americans.
On your way, bud.
I feel better. For once we know what's going on around here.
For once we get the story... before my wife writes it up and it's the daily news.
Here goes my last butt.
Don't tell me your problems.
Tell the chaplain.
Chaplain. I forgot.
We've got nothing to worry about.
Holy Joe is going to pray for us at the Christmas services.
"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.
"They shall mount up with wings as eagles."
If the fog lifts.
"They shall run, and not be weary."
Unless they have frozen feet.
"And they shall walk, and not faint."
If they don't lose too much blood before the medics come up.
Another airmail message from the Krauts.
"Merry Christmas, soldier, and our deepest sympathy.
"It's tough being away from home at this time of year...
"especially when you're surrounded and outnumbered 10-to-1.
"Don't you feel your loved ones worrying about you, praying for you?
"Yes, old boy, praying and hoping you'll come home again.
"Man, have you thought about it?
What if you don't come back?
"Just remember this:
Where there's a will, there's a way.
"Hot chow and safety are waiting for you only 300 yards away."
Anybody here from Ohio?
- Buckeye Lake, sir.
- Cincinnati.
- Maple Heights, sir.
- Tippecanoe City, sir.
I'm from Chillicothe.
Any of you men Lutherans?
Here, sir.
- I am, sir.
- My wife is, sir.
So am I.
These services aren't just for Lutherans, any more than just for men from Ohio.
I merely happen to be in your area.
In other areas, there are other chaplains of various denominations and religions.
All of us Holy Joes are switch-hitters.
Earlier this month in Holland,
I held Hanukkah services... for some of the men of the Jewish faith.
How did I do, Levenstein?
Not bad for a beginner, sir.
Now it's nearly Christmas... and here we are in beautiful Bastogne enjoying the winter sports.
And the $64 question is:
"Was this trip necessary?"
I'll try to answer that.
But my sermons, like everything else in the army... depend on the situation and the terrain.
So I assure you this is going to be a quickie.
Was this trip necessary?
Let's look at the facts.
Nobody wanted this war but the Nazis.
A great many people tried to deal with them, and a lot of them are dead.
Millions have died... for no other reason except that the Nazis wanted them dead.
So, in the final showdown, there was nothing left to do except fight.
There's a great lesson in this.
Those of us who've learned it the hard way aren't going to forget it.
We must never again let any force dedicated to a super-race... or a super-idea, or super-anything... become strong enough to impose itself upon a free world.
We must be smart enough and tough enough in the beginning... to put out the fire before it starts spreading.
So my answer to the $64 question is:
Yes, this trip was necessary.
As the years go by, a lot of people are going to forget.
But you won't.
And don't ever let anybody tell you... you were a sucker to fight in the war against Fascism.
And now, Jerry permitting, let us pray.
Let us pray for this fog to lift.
Almighty God...
The organist is hitting those bass notes a little too loud for me to be heard.
So let us each pray in his own way, to his own God.
When you hear planes, men, don't bother to look up.
They'll be ours.
Yeah, they'll all be going to Berlin.
Layton, you haven't got a beat-up, old chocolate bar, have you?
I'm on that new lemonade diet.
Drop another nickel in the jukebox, will you, chum?
We interrupt this program with an important announcement.
A careful study of the most scientific instruments and maps... lead to the following weather forecast.
Continued cold, more snow, and no sign of the fog lifting.
And now an old favorite, which is growing more and more popular... with the men of the 101st:
I Surrender, Dear.
Krauts walking around down there.
Tanks, too.
What am I supposed to use for ammunition? Spitballs?
We've got 10 rounds left for Old Betsy.
- What about the tank at the roadblock?
- Can't move up. They're out of gas.
Try and get some news on that radio.
Krauts have got it jammed up, everything except their own wavelength.
I'll try again.
They ain't even dug in.
- Holley.
- What?
Is there anything to those stories about Krauts shooting prisoners?
- Where'd you get that?
- It's going around.
I heard that if you've got a Kraut pistol on you when you're captured... they blow your brains out with it.
Don't fall for them rumors, Layton.
Anybody want a Luger?
It's worth $100 in Paris.
Thanks a lot.
It's a violation of the Sullivan Act for a civilian to carry firearms.
If I was you, Lieutenant,
I'd hightail it out of here.
Other side of the hill! Dig in!
A careful study of the most scientific instruments and maps... leads me to believe that German bombers are over Bastogne... fog or no fog.
Kind of rough on rear echelon tonight.
Yeah, I've been thinking... the Mess Sergeant, the Supply Sergeant... the pill roller who gives us those shots with a square needle...
I'm bleeding for them.
...let me avoid death... let me have forgiveness... the eternal farewell.
Fall out in and draw a rifle!
- A rifle?
- They just made you a rifleman. Me, too.
The medics told me I wasn't supposed to go up anymore. You can check.
Get your blanket.
Fall out. Draw rifles and ammo right now!
- Chow?
- You ain't even warm.
Follow me, all of you, on the double!
That's all, brother.
Hey, you! Front and center!
Good thing they didn't send me up.
I never even fired an M-1 rifle.
Last time I was out on the range, they were still using the.03.
All litter cases will prepare to be evacuated immediately... to air raid shelters.
All walking wounded will fall out and draw rifles.
This is a.30-caliber, gas-operated, clip-fed, semiautomatic rifle.
Look, you ain't selling it to me.
You're only showing me how it works.
To load it, you just pull the bolt back like this, and stick the clip in.
- What's up, Smitty?
- Battalion says to pull back.
- Go ahead.
- You, too, sir. They said to tell you.
It's a cinch we ain't pulling back that way.
I guess maybe we ain't pulling back at all.
Lieutenant, take the second squad.
First squad! Third squad! Over here.
Save it, Layton.
They'll be getting a lot closer, and we'll still be here.
It's shining!
How have you been?
Jarvess, look at them! They got here!
Drive them out of there! Blast them!
C-47s!
What was that about eagles?
"They shall mount up with wings as eagles.
"They shall run and not be weary."
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Let's go!
- Save me a couple of drops for my lighter.
- Lighter?
I got a little old lamp I got to fill back in Bastogne.
K rations.
All dinners.
Hey, fellows, here it is.
Hey, fellows, come and get it.
Here, take your watch.
Daddy, what are them things?
It's a new kind of warfare, son.
Mechanized, I think they call it.
Read about it in the Stars and Stripes.
What will they think of next?
Tank job, cigarette for papa?
Got a Stars and Stripes?
It's two days old.
Heard it's been pretty rugged up here.
That's for sure. That's for dang sure.
Hey, handsome.
Good luck!
The folks back home knew we'd get out of this.
They heard relief was breaking through two days ago.
Fine. I'd hate to think they'd been worrying.
You'll be happy to know we're in Belgium, not Luxembourg.
Just so we're going back.
That's all that counts.
You mean you're not happy in the service?
I didn't say that. I love it.
You found a home in the Army, chum.
Me, too. Never had it so good in my life.
Third platoon, on your feet.
Fall in.
Oh, no!
About face.
Forward march.
Whatever happened to Jody?
All right. Come on.
What do you want these guys to think, you're a bunch of WACs?
All right. Pick it up. Hut, two, three.
This is Burma...
the toughest battleground in the world...
where the Japs had sealed off
the Burma road...
and closed the back door to China.
A door that had to be reopened.
After months of secret preparations...
at Mountbatten's base headquarters
in India...
a far-reaching,
combined operations was about to begin.
British General Wingate
conferred with his staff.
Gen. Stilwell speeded up the training
of his Chinese troops.
A special group of American Army
Air Force commandos...
was set up under Col. Bill Cochran.
And deep in the jungle,
the forward command posts...
of a force called Merrill's Marauders
got ready to push off.
Only their top officers
knew where to, or what for.
One hot afternoon, a reconnaissance
plane from an advance air base...
near the border of India
scouted the Jap-infested jungle.
The operation was about to begin.
Its objective:
Burma.
Major, photographs for the general.
Wait here.
General, the photographs of the Red Robin operation have come in.
Good!
Good work. Fine.
Lad, it's been a long time.
But here's where we start paying back the Japs.
Your parachuters will get the first crack.
That's okay with us.
- Rush these to Col. Carter.
- Yes, sir.
- Get Carter on the phone.
- Yes, sir.
Take these to Col. Carter,
503rd Parachute Infantry Headquarters.
- Col. Carter.
- Carter?
Feed your men some raw meat.
We're going in.
The Red Robin operation goes into effect immediately.
- Photographs?
- Yes, sir.
For Col. Carter.
- Okay, Ned. Now you can go back to sleep.
- Thank you, sir.
Nelson, here's your jump area.
- Jacobs, get me a weather report.
- Yes, sir.
Leopard, 5-1.
Looks pretty good to me, Colonel.
Edge of the trees there ought to make good cover.
With the wind blowing west, this'll make a good go point.
Weather prediction remains same.
No changes expected.
Good. Report all changes as they occur.
- Nelson, you're ready to go, I think.
- Yes, sir.
You take off at 3:45 a.m., and jump at dawn.
Your landing will be covered by a diversionary bombing.
The CG has assigned six bombers to drop a load here at Yawe.
Once you and your boys get in, it's up to you to find the target and blow it.
I don't have to pound on your skull and make big speeches... as to what this mission means.
I think you know.
If you do good... it means the lives of several thousand men.
So do good.
Roger.
Jacobs, I'll take the first platoon.
Briefing in an hour.
Nelson, here we go.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Treacy? Briefing, one hour.
First platoon, briefing in an hour. Yes, sir.
Save that for the Japs. Briefing in an hour.
Okay, you guys. Briefing in an hour.
All right, you bathing beauties.
Briefing in an hour.
- Briefing in an hour, Gabby.
- Just a minute.
I'm washing my last pair of nylons.
It's about time.
Never mind filling it, Doc.
We've got briefing in an hour. Pull it.
No!
Briefing in an hour, you guys.
- Thanks for the buck.
- I hate sergeants.
Give me a shampoo, a light trim, and a manicure.
Finish it after the war.
Briefing in an hour.
You monkeys!
First platoon, briefing in an hour.
Come on. Throw the ball, you dummy.
I want to write a letter.
- But what a babe.
- Yeah?
A real straw job, see?
- Stacked up like a pair of bricks.
- I know the type.
- They take a taxi to cross the street.
- But could she spend the dough.
It's about time we saw some action.
Speaking for myself...
I'd just as soon take it easy for another 100 years.
All right! Stop hounding me, will you?
When?
- Suppose you get killed?
- So I get killed.
- So you're out $2.
- Quit waving your teeth.
All right, but I still don't think this is a way to fight a war.
We've been sitting around so much, we've bunions on our landing gear.
You batted your gums so much, you have bunions on your lip.
I don't like your attitude.
If I only had one more...
Who's that?
Who's what?
The guy with Lieutenant Jacobs.
I've never seen him before.
He's that newspaper Joe that just came in yesterday.
No kidding? You mean we're gonna be in the newspapers?
Just in case he's gonna take pictures.
Why should anybody in his right mind want a picture of you?
What do you mean?
- I'm a curiosity.
- You're not kidding.
No. I mean on account of I'm on a mission.
My old lady expects me personally to capture Adolf Hitler... and here I am in India.
Doesn't that make me a curiosity?
You're just khaki-wacky.
Attention!
I'll make it short, men.
Capt. Nelson will brief you on the operation in a moment.
I just want to say this:
Two years ago, when Gen. Stilwell was run out of Burma... he said among other things, that we took an awful pasting... and somebody ought to go back in there and do something about it.
We're going.
You men will be the first to go back into Burma.
The action you're about to see is the first step... of an extremely important operation.
On the success of your mission, depends to a large extent... the entire course of the war in this theater.
It's a big job.
And I know you'll do it right.
Good luck to you.
And good hunting.
Capt. Nelson.
Let's get started.
You can smoke if you want to... and speak up if you can't hear me in the back.
Our mission is to demolish a Jap radar station... and communications center somewhere near point W... on operations map B.
All we have to do is to go in, find the radar station, blow it to pieces.
Then get out of there before the Japs know we're in.
I guess you're wondering why the Air Force doesn't go and bomb it.
We know approximately where the radar station is.
Approximately isn't good enough.
The Air Force needs to know exactly where it is. They don't.
The target's got to be destroyed.
Someone's got to do it.
We're elected.
All right. We're going in.
All right. Gather around the sand table and I'll show you where you're going.
Don't shove, Hogan. Take it easy.
Guy must think it's a free lunch counter.
All right. We come in due east.
As soon as we reach the junction of these two rivers... we cross this small range of hills here.
The other side of that is the jump field.
We'll jump just as soon as we reach the edge of the field. Is that understood?
And Miggleori, if we happen to run across any Burmese dancing girls... we can't stop and talk to them.
At last reports, the jump field was undefended.
Jap patrols are from 30 to 60 men that have been spotted at various... places this past month, usually in this area here.
Now, somewhere in this area is the radar station we're after.
It's not going to be a cinch finding it.
There's a supply depot located at point X.
And it's garrisoned by about 2,000 men.
Now, are there any questions so far?
- Nebraska.
- There aren't any names on the table.
Where is this place?
For security reasons, we won't know until we board the planes.
Then you'll be given maps with names, places, locations. Any other questions?
Higgins?
If you don't mind, sir, how do we get back?
We'll fly back. Two transports are going to pick us up at an abandoned airstrip... and fly us back to the base.
I'll ask Maj. Fitzpatrick of the Burma Rifles to tell you more.
- Go ahead, Major.
- Thanks.
Two years ago, shortly before evacuating Burma... we had an occasion to construct an emergency airstrip here.
It's still there, and the latest aerial reconnaissance tells us it's still usable.
Following the action against the radar station, your route of departure... will be track "E"... along here to the abandoned airstrip at "R2" here.
To make sure that you hit the airstrip on the nose we've assigned... two Gurkha guides from the Burma Frontier Force to go with you.
Col. Holgerkin?
They don't speak English to any worthwhile degree.
But they're extraordinarily familiar with the terrain and the Burmese language.
I believe that you will find them excellent guides.
- That's all from me.
- Thank you, Major.
The march from the radar station to the airstrip will be a forced march... that shouldn't last over 11 hours at most.
Here's the administration information:
No musette bags, shelter halves or toilet articles are to be taken.
Each man will be issued four D rations, two K rations.
You'll carry SOP ammunition loads.
You'll take two.30 caliber machine guns,
1,000 rounds of ammo per gun.
Each man will take six hand grenades.
You'll carry SCR - 536 radios, one set of panels, four mirrors... for signal communications.
That's about it.
Stations and HR will be announced later.
You'd better hit the sack early, get some sleep. You'll need it.
Write your letters now. There's no mailing service where we're going.
The chaplains of each faith will hold services in half an hour.
That's all, fellows. Dismissed.
- You're Williams? American news service?
- That's right.
- Nice to know you. I'm Nelson.
- Glad to know you.
- The colonel said you'll be at the briefing.
- He didn't say why.
I don't think you'll fall on my neck and kiss me when you find out.
But the fact of the matter is,
I'm going along with you.
Yes. GHQ said it was okay for one correspondent to accompany the mission.
We drew lots for it and I won, and here I am.
If you got the authority, I can't stop you.
But I ought to warn you... it's going to be very tough.
Really? It sounded to me just like a routine job.
It won't be routine, not even for the kids who are trained.
I guess I can take it for a day or so.
All right. Let's go get your equipment.
Mr. Williams, it's your life, so I'll give it to you straight.
This isn't a job for you, it's a young man's job.
I'm not exactly decrepit.
Maybe not. Do you know how old the colonel is in there?
Thirty-four.
Do you know how old our commanding general is?
Thirty-seven.
Young men, all of us. We've got to be.
Do you know why?
I'll give you two good reasons:
We jump out of planes, and guys shoot at us.
This isn't exactly healthy, unless you're young enough to take it.
Pardon my asking, but how old are you, Mr. Williams?
That's a military secret. Wait a minute.
Let me tell you something.
You know what I did before the war? I sat on a soft cushion in a pine-paneled office...
I gave orders, people jumped and I made a bucket of dough per week.
Now I'm out here.
I came here as I wanted to be here.
Because I wanted to do what I could... so the people back home would know a little better what war is about.
I'm making no dough, Capt. Nelson, and I may wind up with... a bullet through my... typewriter.
I know it isn't easy.
I didn't come here expecting it to be easy.
And you're not fighting this war from behind a desk, are you? No.
I'm not writing it from behind one, either.
Okay, Pop. Maybe you're a little old, but you'll do. Glad to have you with us.
I ought to be 20 years younger, maybe in better condition.
When you get back, you'll be in a worse state... you won't be any younger,
I guarantee you.
- Sergeant, I got a customer for you.
- Yes, sir.
Everything from soup to nuts.
Complete jump outfit.
Ever jump before, Williams?
Yes. Several times.
Did you like it?
Doesn't bother me.
- Bothers me.
- Here it is, sir.
Thank you. There's something missing.
What's that, sir?
The jeep to carry it in.
Everything's set, Nelson.
Stations, 3:45 a.m.
Right. Thanks.
Thanks. Thank you.
Hi, Barker.
- Hello, sir.
- You'll haul us?
- Yes, sir.
- Swell. What time you got?
I got 3:25 a.m. On the nose.
That check with you?
- What time do we meet with our bombers?
- 50 minutes out.
Right.
- Hi, Sid.
- Hi.
This is Mark Williams, the American news syndicate.
- I think you two know each other.
- Yeah. How do you do?
Meet Capt. Li, Chinese Republican Army.
How do you do, sir?
Better get your chute on.
The chute. Yeah.
Sid, I think you better take Capt. Li and one of the Gurkhas with you... and I'll take Mr. Williams and the other Gurkha with me.
3:26 a.m.
On the nose. Okay.
Good jump, partner. Take care of yourself.
You say you've jumped before?
- Several times.
- Didn't it bother you?
- What?
- Landing on your head.
- You're sticking it on upside down.
- That's funny. I didn't notice.
You would have eventually.
Get the lead out, you guys!
You're holding up the war.
- Keep your pants on.
- Soapy, give me a hand with my bustle.
Sure. If it doesn't work, you can bring it back.
Times like these, I wish I were in the Navy.
If you was in the Navy,
I'd sell my war bonds.
As I was telling you about her. I says,
"Honey, this is love at first sight...
"as I only have a 10-hour pass."
Soapy, Hogan, give him a hand with his chute.
- You going to jump with us?
- Got any objections?
It's your funeral, Pop.
Did you hear that? Grandpa's gonna jump.
He's off his rocker.
Like I always said, civilians got no brains.
I'll stick you behind the newspaper guy.
If he freezes, you know what to do.
- Give him the works.
- It's a pleasure.
All right, boys. Fall in, in this order.
Gordon, 18.
Miggleori, 17. Jarod, 16. Brophy, 15.
Chedrees, 14. Schwartz, 13.
Helvicki, 12. Negulesco, 11. Hollis, 10.
O'Brien, 9. Hogan, 8. Rafferty, 7. Hooper, 6.
Rankin, 5. Higgins, 4.
Treacy, 3. Williams, 2.
You'd look silly if you fell out of that thing in the air.
Okay, load up!
- Brother, I'm getting sick already.
- Take it easy, fellows.
Ready, boys? Here we go again.
Pass these maps out, Treace.
Pass them out.
So my sweetheart back home writes to me... and wants to know what this gal in Bombay has, that she doesn't.
So I just wrote back to her and says,
"Nothing, honey, only she's got it here."
I know what you mean.
Boys, after this war is over,
I might even make a jump.
If this trip gets a little rough for you, there's a bucket back there. Use it.
Certainly is hot in here.
You'll cool off.
Just wait until we get up to 11,000 feet.
- Brother, you'll freeze your tonsils.
- 11,000 feet? That's over two miles.
We don't jump from there, do we?
No. Once we get over the Hookon Pass, we come down to 300 feet to jump.
300 feet. That still seems a long way from the ground to me.
No, that's close. The closer the better.
Less chance of getting shot at, and more chance of hitting the right spot.
It still sounds very risky. Very risky.
...and as soon as we bury the chutes we're shoving off.
Now remember, boys, we can't tip them off we're in there.
So no shooting till we hit the radar station.
- Do you get it?
- Yes, sir.
Okay.
- How you doing?
- Great. Absolutely great.
Well, maybe not absolutely.
Don't worry about it.
Everybody sweats the jump out a bit, no matter how often you do it.
Some pretty tough hombres freeze right at the door.
- Really?
- You'll be all right.
Yeah, that's what the cat said to the canary when he swallowed him:
"You'll be all right."
All right, fellows. Smoke up.
- It's on the house.
- Thanks, Captain.
Don't thank me.
I swiped them from the colonel.
Free butts.
Now I know I'm getting bumped.
- What's your name, son?
- Soapy Higgins from Flatbush.
- One of them bozos?
- That's right.
Got a match?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.
Take it easy, Pop. There's nothing to it.
- Really? That's fine.
- Only one thing, though.
What's that?
After we jump, if we have to pick you up with a blotter... where do you want the blotter sent?
To my mother. She collects blotters.
"George pulled out his gun and aimed..."
There's our bomber escort.
Right on time, too.
Those babies are always welcome.
Am I glad to see you.
Take it easy, pal.
You've been through this before.
Lay off, or I'll kick your teeth in.
Got the shakes?
I won't stick in the door.
- Don't worry about me.
- Who's worrying?
- Listen, Gabby.
- Yeah?
You're right behind me.
Just in case I should stick, give me a little shove, will you?
If you go, you go by yourself.
I ain't shoving nobody through no door.
But you're my friend, ain't you?
Don't let me freeze.
If I stick, they'll kick me out, you hear?
Miggleori...
I ever tell you about the time
I froze in the door in Fort Benning?
- You, sir?
- Sure. Oh, boy.
I think it was about my fourth or fifth jump.
Anyway, about five minutes before it was time to go...
I felt myself starting to get the shakes.
I got up to the door,
I wanted to go and I couldn't.
I froze just like a cigar-store Indian.
There I was, like that, looking down.
My brain kept saying to me,
"Go on. Jump, will you? Jump!"
Couldn't do it.
Finally, I got so sore at myself,
I said to myself:
"If you don't jump, when I get you back on the ground...
"I'll drill a hole right through you.
Understand?"
I guess I got so scared at the idea of shooting myself...
I jumped in self-defense.
Take it easy. Everybody gets a little nervous in the service.
Have a cigarette. Would you like a nice, stiff shot of bourbon?
- Yes, sir!
- So would I.
Ten minutes!
Ten minutes more, sir.
Stand up.
Hook up.
- Williams.
- Yeah? Excuse me, please.
I know you're an old hand at this... but just to refresh your memory here's what you do.
You hook this on up here, like that.
- You hang on to it till you leave the plane.
- Yeah.
When I say, "Stand in the door," you get in line behind me.
- When I go, you go. You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.
That's about all there is to it.
Step out with your right foot first... like you're reaching for a bar rail.
Your static line will do the rest.
It'll open your chute for you.
When you get near the ground, keep your knees and feet close together.
- When you hit the dirt, relax. Okay?
- Okay. Wait a minute!
- What happens if my chute doesn't open?
- You'll be the first one on the ground.
Check equipment.
- Come on. Snap out of it, Mig.
- Yeah.
If anything goes wrong, give this a yank.
It's your emergency chute.
Good luck. Keep your chin up and your strap down.
Sound off for equipment check.
- Eighteen okay!
- Seventeen okay.
- Sixteen okay.
- Fifteen okay.
- Fourteen okay.
- Thirteen okay.
- Twelve okay!
- Eleven okay.
- Ten okay.
- Nine okay.
- Eight okay.
- Seven okay.
- Six okay.
- Five okay.
- Four okay.
- Three okay.
Two okay, I hope.
Stand in the door.
Jump or we'll miss the clearing!
- Get some security out, Sid.
- Right.
- What's that?
- That's our diversionary cover.
If the Jap radar picked us up coming in... a bunch of slopeheads would've met us before we hit the ground.
This way they'll think our planes are bombing their airport right now.
- Darn clever, these Americans.
- So far.
He's found a track.
Good.
- Mig, get the point out.
- Yes, sir.
Sid, you bring up the rear guard.
- I'll be just ahead of the first squad.
- Right.
Might be deep.
Mind getting your feet wet?
I jumped out of the plane, didn't I?
Jump in here.
Baker One to Baker Two. Come in.
Baker Two to Baker One. Go ahead.
Jap patrol coming this way.
Okay, Baker One.
Jap patrol coming this way, sir.
Baker One to Baker Two.
Jap patrol passed.
Roger.
Jacobs.
Map.
This is it. The other end of this line is what we're looking for.
We got the sentries, and Higgins spotted the station.
Good.
Here's the layout.
The radar's right in the center.
Over here is the radio shack, and this building looks like the mess hall.
I think we got a break. They're all at chow.
Here's the plan, Sid.
Take your men and cover the mess hall.
Don't fire till they come out.
Then feed it to 'em.
Treace, take five men and cover the radio shack.
I'll be on your left. You got it?
It's now 6:47 p.m.
We'll give them the works at 6:54 p.m.
That'll give everyone seven minutes to get into position. All set?
- Check.
- Right. Let's move out.
- Good job.
- You said it.
Take your demolition team.
We'll blow everything as soon as possible.
Enough said.
- Treace.
- Yes, sir.
- Any of our boys hurt?
- No, sir, but we sure were lucky.
You're not kidding. Get local security out.
Demolition teams, front and center!
Gabby, take two men and set some charges in the radio shack.
Sweeney, Hallit, do the radar.
You two take this building. Snap it up.
Come on, snap it up, you guys.
I got a date in camp with some Zulus.
Bet you got a room in your house for this.
I think so.
All set now, Chuck.
Right. As soon as we get clear, give her the works.
...paratrooper...
- Paratrooper?
Not too close together. Keep spread out.
I'd like to be up to my neck in ocean about now.
Me, too.
What's the matter?
I was thinking of the time the Japs caught us swimming in New Guinea.
You were laughing like an idiot and all the time I was looking for my pants.
You were yelling,
"Take cover! Take cover!"
- You could have used a little yourself.
- I never did find those pants.
We've had a few laughs.
It would be swell if we could take our next leave together.
Yeah. How about 'Frisco?
Shrimp, clam, lobster.
Yeah, and a steak smothered in chops.
Oh, boy.
It's the old strip all right.
Habeda, scout.
- Hicks, you and Smithy look up that way.
- Yes, sir.
All right, dish out the Atabrine tablets.
Everybody okay?
Okay? Easiest war I ever been in.
What is it today, Hogan?
Chicken dinner with dumplings.
These are the dumplings.
What time are those planes due to pick us up?
Ten minutes.
- Get a story, Mr. Williams?
- I got more than that.
I don't mind telling you gentlemen, there were some moments there... when I wished I was somewhere else.
Almost anywhere else would have done.
If you could be someplace else right now,
Charlie, where would it be?
I don't know. A football game.
How about you?
If I had my choice
I'd be sitting on a nice, soft stool... in the National Press Club in Washington, D. C... surrounding a tall, cold bourbon and soda.
What? I didn't know newspapermen drank.
How about you?
A place you probably never heard of.
Cannonball Island in Central Park.
- Really? New York?
- Yeah, Schenectady, New York.
They have a central park, too, with this island in the middle.
Sort of take your girl there if you're real friendly.
Sounds all right.
- I have a lot of friends in Schenectady.
- No kidding.
Yeah. My column is syndicated there,
The Gazette. Your folks live there?
My father has a grocery store on Crane Street, by the locomotive works.
- Really? Where'd you go to school?
- Union College.
I'm supposed to be a school teacher.
After the war I have an appointment.
History teacher in Pleasant Valley High School.
That's fine. Your folks will get quite a kick out of reading about you.
You mean all that stuff will be in the Schenectady paper?
- Sure. You don't mind, do you?
- Heck, no.
What do you know?
It's a small world, isn't it?
Yes, and it's getting smaller.
If only more folks back home would realize...
Crane Street, Schenectady runs all the way to Burma...
- this would be the last war.
- Amen.
All right, boys, here's the pill that kills the chill.
That's a nice bunch of tombstones you got in your mouth.
Sarge, come on.
- Sergeant!
- Hey, look. Atabrine.
A pill a day keeps the old doc away.
Wake up.
Throw some water on him.
What's the matter?
I thought I heard something.
Maybe they're not ours. Cover.
Army 27805. Army 27805 from Red Leader.
Calling Army 27805 from Red Leader.
Acknowledge.
Calling Army 27805 from Red Leader.
Acknowledge.
Hello, Red Leader.
This is Army 27805 saying go ahead.
Over to you.
Everything clear and ready to land.
Wind direction east to west.
East to west. Over.
Okay, Red Leader, we're coming in.
What kind of a job did you do? Over.
Perfect score. No casualties.
Got the radar station
and about 60 of the garrison. Over.
It was a picnic, eh?
All we do is fly around in this broken-down birdcage.
Those guys have all the fun.
Any bad spots in the field? Over.
No, it's like a billiard table.
Even you could make a landing here.
Come on in.
Over.
Japanese. About 100 men coming this way.
Ready to move, on the double.
Let me see your map.
Calling Army 27805.
Grab your stuff!
We're moving out on the double.
Don't come in. They're waiting for you.
We're getting out of here.
Gain altitude and leave.
There's about 200 Japs waiting for you.
We're moving out.
Look for us in two days at map reference G-285906.
You get it? Map reference G-285906.
We'll be there in two days. Over.
G-285906 in two days.
Okay, Red Leader, got it. Over.
Some picnic.
Tell the other plane we're hightailing it out of here.
Put out a three-man recon.
Come on, snap it.
- Take me to Col. Carter.
- Yes, sir.
- And I came back as soon as I could, sir.
- All right, thank you, Barker.
- Make your report to Intelligence.
- Yes, sir.
Let's see. The action took place here, and he was going this way to...
G-285906.
I hope he can make it.
- I'm sure he will.
- Yeah. I wish I were sure.
I just mean knowing Nelson,
I'm certain, that's all.
I'm sure he can make it to G-285906 all right.
It's the rest of it I'm worried about.
The closer he gets to home the thicker the Japs will be.
The Chindwin river is lined with them like fleas.
- You sound as if he's going to walk out.
- How else do I get him out?
Why do you think I'm sweating it out?
There isn't another airfield between us and Nelson that isn't swarming with Japs.
I can't get him out by plane.
He's got to walk out.
That's 150 miles.
Yeah, 150 miles with Japs lining the whole way, waiting for him.
Oh, brother. This is a wonderful war.
Couldn't they cut an airstrip in the jungle?
With 36 men? It could take weeks.
The Japs wouldn't leave them alone that long.
- They can't walk out. It can't be done.
- Maybe not.
That remains to be seen.
Let's get a cup of coffee.
Ten-minute break, guys. No smoking.
Salt tablets, everyone.
- Take it easy on the water.
- Yes, sir.
Ten-minute break. No smoking.
Easy on the water.
Me, I crave action.
You can't expect to find a Jap behind every tree.
- Personally, I like them in front of trees.
- Better take your salt tablets, men.
Come on, Pop. Snap out of it.
Open up your mouth.
This salt's like a shot in the arm.
Worst is yet to come.
I find that hard to believe.
Hard to believe, he says.
You should have been with us at New Guinea.
That was a war.
- This isn't exactly a clambake.
- I don't go for this. No, sir.
Who does? You guys ain't alone in this muck and mire.
- Hello, muck.
- Hiya, mire.
The way I figure it is this:
Military science is a different kind of science... consisting of tactics.
Maybe you can figure out how we'll get back to the base.
There is the question that interests me.
- We'll get back, all right. Don't worry.
- Don't make sense to me.
Swamps, jungle, rivers, flies, fleas, beetles, bugs, snakes. It's monotonous.
What'd you expect to find in a jungle, booze and babes?
- That ain't a bad idea.
- Look at Williams.
You don't hear him beefing, and he's an old man.
Where'd you get that "old" stuff?
Can't judge terrain from a map, anyway.
It'll be tough both ways.
What do you think?
- Sounds good to me.
- I think it's best.
Okay.
That's it.
Close in, fellas. Close in.
Here's the situation.
Somebody switch that motor off.
That guy can go to sleep on a clothesline.
I don't have to tell you that we're behind that well-known eight ball.
The Japs are cagey.
Plenty cagey, and they're looking for us.
Unless we can outsmart them, they're gonna find us.
The last contact I made with the planes...
I told them to meet us day after tomorrow at map reference G-285906.
That's about 30 miles from here.
But I don't know how many miles that we can travel in a day.
There's no way of telling through this kind of stuff.
There's two practical ways we can go.
But again, I don't know which is the best and which is the fastest.
We're going to split up into two groups.
Lt. Jacobs will take one group.
I'll take the other.
That way, if one group hits trouble, the other has a chance to make contact.
Is that clear?
Okay, fellas.
Good luck to all of us.
Capt. Li, you better come with me.
- You too, Williams, you come with me.
- Thanks.
You're gonna have a longer story than you thought.
I'll make a novel out of it.
Jacobs... you better take Gurkha Habeda with you, and the other radio.
Try to keep in touch as often as you can.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
Right.
Take care of yourself, pal.
Hollis, I'll bet you a K ration dinner we get there first.
Okay, Gabby, it's a deal.
Sweeney, mazel tov.
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, sir.
All right, sir.
Broph.
Yes, sir.
- Try to contact Lt. Jacobs again.
- All right, sir.
Baker One to Baker Two.
We've reached the rendezvous.
Where are you?
Baker One to Baker Two.
We're reached the rendezvous.
Come in, Baker Two.
Hello, George. Baker One calling.
Sorry, sir... this thing only carries two and a half miles.
- Guess they aren't in range yet.
- Sure.
Sure, I guess he...
He must have run into some tough jungle.
Maybe so.
- Try him again.
- All right, sir.
Hello, George. Baker One calling.
Baker One to Baker Two.
Come in, Baker Two. Baker One calling.
Army 27805 from Red Leader.
Acknowledge.
Calling Red Leader.
No contact.
Keep trying.
They're down there somewhere.
Army 27805 from Red Leader.
Acknowledge.
- There it is.
- Where?
Hi, men!
Calling Army 27805.
Calling Army 27805 from Red Leader.
Acknowledge.
Hello, Red Leader.
Hang on, here's Barker.
This is Army 27805, saying go ahead.
Over to you.
Army 27805 from Red Leader.
You're coming in on us.
Keep over to your left a little.
All right, hold that course.
You're about a quarter-mile away, that's all.
Right in my lap!
Who said the air corps is not on the job?
You're coming right over us.
Did you spot us? Come in.
Yes, Red Leader, we've got you spotted.
We'll start dropping your supplies on the next run.
Get set back there.
All right then, let's have it!
- All right, Treace, get it in.
- Yes, sir.
Paul, Benny, grab a shovel.
Caesar, come on.
Tell my girl I won't be home for dinner!
Back to Army 27805 from Red Leader.
What's the score, Barker?
Any orders for me from headquarters?
Over.
Looks bad. There's no way of getting you out by plane.
Over.
Okay.
Okay, we'll walk out.
You going to keep us supplied? Over.
We'll drop supplies every four days.
You say where. Over.
Don't get out of range.
I'll give you the map reference.
Red Leader to Army 27805.
The next rendezvous will be in four days... at map reference G-289506.
Did you get it? Over.
G-289506. I got it.
Good luck, Red Leader. Over.
Okay, Barker.
Thanks a lot. Thanks for everything.
Off and over. Roger.
- Break open the cigarettes first.
- One strawberry pie coming up.
- No Thousand Island dressing?
- Here's the skipper.
As you were.
Well, boys, we got another tough break.
I just got word from headquarters that there's no landing field... between here and our base where they can get a plane to pick us up.
That means only one thing.
We got a long hike ahead of us.
Unless we stick together and work together... we're going to be in trouble, plenty.
The most important thing is to take your Atabrine tablets.
Because if you don't and you get sick, particularly with fever... it'll be that much tougher on the rest of us.
So be careful.
As soon as Lt. Jacobs and his men get here, we'll shove off.
That's all.
Okay, carve the turkey.
If we gotta walk, we gotta eat.
Well, Willie...
Iooks like we're up a Burmese creek without any paddle.
Capt. Li, ask the Gurkha how far it is to Sittaung.
He doesn't know exactly, but about 200 miles.
You ain't just whistling Dixie, brother.
Two hundred...
Let's go get some vitamins.
- You want a hand?
- I can get up by myself.
You hope.
How did you happen to get mixed up with this outfit of leaping fleas, anyway?
What was it, for fun, money, or marbles?
A bit of each, I guess.
This wouldn't have been so tough... if the Japs hadn't thrown a monkey wrench into us at the start.
When you deal with monkeys you've got to expect some wrenches.
My boys are trained for it.
I thought they were trained to jump, not walk.
Why didn't you join the Navy?
I can walk further than I can swim, brother.
Broph, cut me a slice of rare roast beef, will you?
With the gravy dripping onto it.
Thanks. Delicious.
All this meat and no potatoes.
Soapy, see if I know tonight's menu.
Two packages of biscuits, a can of cheese.
One envelope lemonade or orange powder.
Four lumps of sugar.
One package of four cigarettes.
A book of ten matches.
A package of candy.
A piece of chewing gum.
What, no floor show?
Why, sure!
The girls are getting their fans right now.
What's the matter, skipper? You worried?
I wish Jacobs would get here.
Jacobs. He's a nice kid.
You know what he told me?
He used to be a schoolteacher.
That's right.
Funny place for a schoolteacher, isn't it?
Or an architect.
Is that what you were?
- Where?
- Maine.
- Maine. Did you make any money at it?
- No.
Not much, but that was all right.
You see... most people have to work 50 weeks a year and they get two weeks' vacation.
I worked two weeks and had a 50-week vacation.
Gave me plenty of time to go fishing.
Somebody's coming, sir, over there.
Cover.
Hollis, what happened?
Give me some salt tablets.
What happened? Where's Lt. Jacobs?
We crossed the railroad okay.
Me and...
Sweeney were way up in front.
First thing you know, the Japs open up with machine guns.
All around, they were all around us.
They let us get by.
Then they opened up on the main body.
Never saw anything like it.
It was a slaughterhouse.
- The Japs follow you here?
- I don't know.
Paul, Chuck, bring a stretcher for Hollis.
We're moving out.
Pass out the grenades and bury those boxes.
You going to try to take him with us?
I should leave him. He'll slow us up.
But I can't do it.
We'll have to do something for Hollis or else he'll go into shock.
Can't we stop and give him some plasma?
We can't stop. You'll have to try to give it to him on the way.
Native village up ahead, sir.
- Take it easy, Hollis.
- I'm all right. Let me up.
- How do you feel, kid?
- Much better, sir.
- Think you can walk?
- I think so, sir.
- Thanks.
- Attaboy.
That plasma even made your hair grow.
- What do you think?
- I don't like it.
It's too quiet.
I think you're right. We'll skip it.
Burmese.
Tell them to come up.
Stick their hands up.
What do they want?
Fifty Japanese were in the village.
They left this morning.
Looking for us?
They wish to help us. They hate the Japan.
The men were made slave, and even the women.
He says do we wish to see the other men like us?
The other men like us?
What's he talking about? Where? Ask him.
In the village.
Any Japs there?
They have all gone but two men.
Nebraska, take three men.
Get rid of those sentries... if they're there. We'll wait for the signal.
Come on, Soapy. Let's go.
You better tell these fellas to wait in the jungle.
You two go ahead. Cover us.
There's a couple of monkeys in there we got to get.
O'Neil... you and Rafferty set a couple of grenade traps.
Stick one in here and one over there.
Yes, sir.
Corporal.
Put about five men that end of the village.
- Take a machine gun with you.
- Yes, sir.
Looks like my mother-in-law's house in the Bronx.
She's crazy about dogs, too.
Set it in there, Pete.
Brophy over there. Hank, up top.
Nebraska, what did you find?
- I found our boys, Captain.
- Where?
But I wish I hadn't, sir.
They're all cut to pieces.
Too awful to look at.
That's Harris.
Isn't it?
- But who are the others?
- I don't know.
How do I know who they are?
If they were my brothers
I still wouldn't know.
Take it easy.
They can't feel anything now.
But Jacobs. Where's Jacobs?
Where's Jacobs?
Take their tags.
- Bury them.
- Yes, sir.
We found Lt. Jacobs, sir.
Please.
No more.
Sid.
No more, please.
Leave me alone. Please.
It's me, Nelson.
Nelson.
Kill me, Nelson.
Please shoot me.
We're gonna get you out of here.
We're not gonna let you stay here.
Don't touch me.
The others got it, too... when they wouldn't talk.
"How many men in your party?"
Over and over...
And then they died.
Listen, Nelson, do me a favor.
- Will you, please?
- Anything.
Kill me, Nelson.
Please kill me.
I ask you.
Please.
I've been a newspaperman for 30 years.
I thought I'd seen or... read about everything... that one man can do to another.
From the torture chambers of the Middle Ages... to the gang wars and the lynchings of the day.
But this...
This is different.
This was done in cold blood.
By a people who... claim to be civilized!
Civilized!
They're degenerate, immoral idiots.
Stinking little savages.
Wipe them out, I say.
Wipe them off the face of the Earth!
Wipe them off the face of the Earth, the bastards.
Sid.
I never thought...
I'd be glad to see you dead.
- Here are the tags, sir.
- Right.
We got about 16 of them, but they still outnumber us 2 to 1.
Go back to the corporal.
Tell him to pull the machine gun out.
He's got to cover us until we cross the swamp.
- Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.
Treace... you better hang on to these.
I'm going with him.
- But, sir...
- Go on, get going.
When you get your men across, set the machine gun up to cover us. Go on.
Come on, Mig.
Let's give them a couple of pineapples.
Mazel tov!
Get in the water. Stay close to the bank.
Come on, on the double with that gun!
Now, Miggy, Smith!
Come on.
All right, pull that gun out.
Get going, Treace.
- Lift him up and carry him. Snap it up.
- We won't have to, Captain.
Get his tag.
So long, Soapy.
- Colonel in yet?
- Not yet, sir.
- What's up?
- Plenty.
Wingate and Cochran flew in yesterday.
Big conference, GHQ.
Must be big. Nearly 6:00 a.m.
They've been at it all night.
They're still at it.
I'm loaded with supplies for Nelson.
Wonder if I ought to wait.
- They've left instructions for you.
- Barker, come over here.
When you contact Nelson...
You better write this down.
Nelson was to proceed along this line due west.
That's out.
Tell him to disregard all previous instructions.
He's to go north... to map reference D-2...
He's to get there as quickly as possible then stay there.
Disregard all previous instructions.
Proceed north to map reference D-247850...
- and stay there.
- That's it.
I think I'll get some sleep.
- What's up?
- Can't tell you. But it's okay, believe me.
Hey, Pop, writing a letter to your mother?
No, son, to yours, to all your mothers.
What you thinking about, Gabby?
I wonder what happened to those two Zulus I had a date with last week.
- Looks like one of our ships, sir.
- Try and contact him, Broph.
Army 27805 from Red Leader.
Acknowledge.
This is Army 27805 to Red Leader.
This is official from Black Leopard.
Disregard all previous instructions. Over.
Just a minute, Barker, while I get my map.
Open to "D" reference.
Okay, ready. Over.
Proceed north to map reference D-247850
as quickly as possible.
And stay there. End of message. Over.
North?
North to map reference D-247850.
- Okay, got it. Over.
- Stand by. We're coming in for a run.
Take it away.
He said north.
I don't get it.
Why, that's directly away from the base.
- We aren't going home?
- Guess not.
I don't get it.
Don't like it either.
Neither do I.
It's orders. So that's where we're going.
You hear that? We ain't going home.
I hope they know what they're doing.
If they order us north, they've a good reason for ordering us north.
Maybe.
Maybe we're going to contact the Chinese troops.
Maybe there's another landing strip.
I'll bet that's what it is, another landing strip.
It could be there's a British outpost up there.
- Maybe that's why...
- Yeah, maybe.
Maybe if your aunt had a beard, she'd be your uncle.
I got it. I got the whole solution.
Maybe there's a nice saloon up north with scoopers of beer a foot high.
And Burmese dancing girls crying their eyes out just to hold your hand.
Maybe there's a cute little vine-covered cottage by a waterfall.
Your old gray-haired mother standing on the front porch waiting... with a pitcher of milk in each mitt. Maybe.
He's gonna drop it in our laps this time.
Come on, let's bring it in.
Ambush!
Come on.
No, Pete! Come back!
The radio. Smashed to bits.
Come on.
All right, you tell me. Where is he?
How many men has Nelson got left?
Are they alive, or are they dead?
Give me some answers.
At least a portion of the force was left when they contacted our supply plane.
That was days ago. Take a look at this.
It was taken this morning.
Supply bundles lying where they were dropped.
Three dead men to keep company, and play host to every fly in Burma.
Maybe one of them is Nelson.
- How do we know?
- We don't.
They must have run into a superior Jap force in the clearing.
Couldn't pick up supplies.
Nelson lit out, the Japs lit out after him.
Even if he got away from the Japs, by now he's certainly out of food and supplies.
He's certainly behind the well-known eight ball.
Here come the reconnaissance pilots.
How'd you make out?
- Any trace of Nelson?
- No, sir.
I went up and down that route like a kid on a bicycle. From... here to here.
I covered this leg on a 90-degree sweep.
Didn't see a thing.
This was my route.
I flew high and low for three hours.
If there was anything underneath those trees, I didn't see it.
Not a sign of them.
All right, the search is over.
We've got two days of briefing ahead of us... and an important operation at the end of it.
Thanks very much.
Where's Barker?
Why wasn't he here?
Why hasn't he checked in?
He's at the advance base. He's making a big sweep today and tomorrow.
- Did you tell him it was his last trip?
- No, sir.
I didn't have the guts to tell him, sir.
I know what you mean.
Tell him when he comes in tomorrow.
Search is over. It's finished.
Captain!
What's the matter, Pop, you got it bad?
Bad enough, I guess.
I'm sorry, Chuck.
You told me not to come.
Sure, my mother told me to stay home, too.
Helvicki, Negulesco, pick him up.
Come on, close up.
There it is!
It's one of ours!
Here we are, right here!
Wait! Come back!
Here we are! Down here!
Don't leave us here. Wait! Come back!
Over here!
Come on, will ya!
Over here!
Come back! Don't leave us here!
Come back! Look, here we are!
Don't! Come back!
Come back. Don't leave us here.
Hollis, snap out of it!
Leave him alone. He doesn't want anyone.
Better let him get it out of his system.
Let's take 10 minutes.
Do you want to get sick?
Where's your purifying tablet?
I lost them when we made that last river crossing.
They'll remember me in history.
Gabby Gordon, the guy who purified all the stinking rivers in Burma.
Here, take these.
- No, Captain, they're yours. You need 'em.
- Take 'em... or they'll remember you as the guy who got shot for disobeying orders.
Third time we've missed a plane in the last two days.
Three strikes is out.
You going soft on me, Treace?
I'm not exactly jumping with joy at the way things are turning out.
If that's going soft, okay, I'm going soft.
I still don't get this business of heading north... toward a place we don't know anything about.
When we get there, where are we?
Where we're told to go. How's that?
Yes, sir. Sorry.
What do you think is up on that hill?
Nelson said we got to get there.
That means something.
The way home. That's what's up there.
Sure. Remember back in briefing... when they were telling us this was gonna be a big operation?
Maybe we're gonna meet our troops there.
Been talking about an airborne invasion.
Yeah, all we do is walk up that hill... and there's Vinegar Joe Stilwell, waiting for us with a fistful of medals.
Medals. I'll take a hamburger.
I know you're all in. So am I.
I know you're all wondering why we're heading north, instead of toward our base.
I don't know the reason, but there must be one.
The sooner we get to the top of that hill they've ordered us to... the sooner we'll reach safety.
Come on. On your feet. Let's go.
Come on. I'd follow him down the barrel of a cannon.
Hey, Pop.
That's the wrong way.
This way.
Helvicki... give him a hand.
My hat, sir.
But there's nothing here.
Nothing.
Is this the place?
Yeah.
Treace, set the machine gun up over there at the head of the track.
Gabby, take two men and dig in over there.
Negulesco, over there.
Nebraska, there.
What's the matter with you?
What did you expect to find up here, anyway?
I don't like this any better than you do.
But we had orders to come here, and we'll stay here if we rot waiting.
So get on your feet and start digging in.
Give me that shovel.
Could I have my shovel, sir?
We're going to stay here?
Yep... for a long time.
This looks like a one-way street.
How is it?
How's what?
How's the dirt?
How does it stack up against Maine?
In Maine, it's better.
It's sure peaceful so far.
That's the way I like it. Peaceful.
I always said when I starved to death,
I wanted it to be peaceful.
I better get out of here, before you guys break my heart.
Capt. Nelson. Mr. Williams, he's gone.
Gone?
He couldn't have got far.
Set out and take a look for him.
Go out and look for Pop.
Here he is, sir! Down here!
Poor old guy.
I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Williams.
Awfully sorry.
Better get a grave dug, Treace.
Yes, sir.
We won't forget you, Pop.
From now on, if I ever get to buy another newspaper...
I'll remember what a few cents can buy.
So long.
It's funny, how he was always trying to find out what we were fighting for.
Maybe now he knows.
Say, Gabby... do you really think we're going to get out of this?
I mean, honest.
Grow up, you ain't gonna...
- What is it?
- Shut up. Listen.
There it is.
A C-47. One of ours.
Over this way!
Here we are!
- Looks like he's coming right over us.
- Over here!
A signal at two o'clock.
L-S-O-N.
N-E-L-S-O-N. It's Nelson!
- Shoot a signal. Say we'll drop supplies.
- Right.
He's gonna drop supplies.
Gabby, Nebraska!
Get ready back there.
- Let's get at it, now.
- Christmas on a hilltop.
What's the first thing you'll do when you get back home?
- Two guesses.
- Come on, tell me.
First I'm gonna kiss my girl like she's never been kissed before.
Yeah? Then what?
Then I'm gonna take off my parachute.
All right, you guys. Break it up.
You could see the chutes come down
10 miles away.
Come on, let's get back under cover.
Hicks, take the booby traps.
Set them down around that draw.
Smitty, you set yours about 70 yards down the side of the hill.
All right, fellas, get your hand grenades.
Let's get dug in.
- Gets dark fast, doesn't it?
- Yeah.
You think the Japs spotted us?
We'll probably find out as soon as it gets dark.
What happens now?
What if they come up?
They'll come up.
It isn't dark enough for them yet, but they'll come up all right.
They'll be playing tricks pretty soon, so watch yourself.
Just have to sweat it out, that's all.
Did you hear something?
No, you're just jittery.
Who's that?
Take it easy, pal. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Guess I'm getting a little jumpy.
Hollis, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Where are you, Joe?
Over here.
Here I am, sweetheart.
By the way, my name ain't Joe.
Nelson, you okay?
- Nelson?
- Shut up.
They're trying to draw our fire.
The monkeys have pulled out, sir.
Pulled out?
That's funny.
Who said those guys never quit?
Everybody's okay but Hollis. They got him.
So much for Mrs. Hollis' nine months of pain... and 20 years of hope.
Planes!
Down! Take cover!
Now you know why we were sent here.
That's why they made us wait:
The invasion of Burma.
If Nelson's still alive, he'll join us.
Too bad we had to drop him those supplies.
I hope it draws every Jap within 50 miles away from where we're going, that's good.
Even if my mother-in-law is in one of them, it's still a great sight.
Boy, look at that! It's raining parachutes!
It looks like Broadway and 42nd street!
2nd Battalion reports enemy patrol activity on his right flank.
Company A reports Capt. Nelson and
11 men are coming through their lines.
- Nelson?
- Yes, sir.
- Guide them into the first-aid station.
- Yes, sir.
- Notify glider S-4.
- Yes, sir.
- You take over.
- Yes, sir.
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
- You're glad?
We gave you up for lost. You're all right.
- You did fine.
- Thanks.
Got a light?
You have no idea how important blowing up that radar station was to us.
Here's what it cost.
Not much to send home, is it?
A handful of Americans.
We'll have you out of here right away.
Jeeps will take you down to the planes.
I'll see you back at the base.
English
Hi.
Hello.
Hmm. Better luck with your shoes off?
Ha.
You waiting to see me?
- Okay. Who are you?
- I'm Pete. Pete Morgan, the manager.
Good. Can you manage me a room in a hotel? I'm tired.
Well, uh, it's kind of tough.
But, uh, I have a little place upstairs while you're waiting, if you're tired.
What did you say your name was?
- Pete. It's a tricky name.
- Pete what?
- Morgan.
- Well, Mr. Morgan, I'd be very happy... if you'd just getJefty for me.
Oh, well, Jefty is a little busy right now.
I usually, uh, handle the details.
Is that so? Well, I'm Lil Stevens, new entertainer from Chicago.
Right now I'd like to sleep.
Oh. The new equipment.
- What do you do to entertain?
- Oh, didn'tJefty tell you?
No, but I can guess. I know Jefty.
Isn't this small stuff for a good performer?
Not at the money I'm getting.
- Small town, small pickings.
- Well, I got a small voice.
- Besides, who said I was good?
- What'd he promise to pay you?
Too much. About twice what I usually get.
And how much is that?
You son of a gun.
I wanted to surprise you.
- You did. You surprised me.
- I did?
Well, what do you think of Lily?
- Was I smart to get her?
- Very smart.
- Come on, Jefty. How about that hotel?
- In a minute, honey.
- She'll be a knockout in the bar, won't she?
- Oh, sure.
I'll get you a place.
But first, uh, have a drink.
Meet the help.
I kept the bar open for you.
Okay. I could do with a little cooking sherry.
Come on, Pete.
Let's celebrate.
Here it is, honey-And it's all Jefty's.
Oh, Susie, come here.
I want you to meet Lily Stevens, our new entertainer.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Take her over to Sam and introduce her to the bar.
- I'll get you a room.
- Fine.
You know, you two are gonna like each other.
Yeah, we already have something in common. Same barber.
What do you do?
Sing? Play the piano?
Mm-hmm. Something like that.
Sam? This is Miss Lily Stevens... our new attraction from Chicago.
Jefty says give her anything she wants.
Always.
- Always is a long time. Glad to know you, Lil.
- Same here, Sam.
- What'll it be?
- Scotch.
- Soda?
- Straight. Got a cigarette?
- Yeah, sure.
- It's quite a deal you've got here, huh?
Yeah, nice bunch.
Bottoms up.
- How's Chicago?
- Okay.
- Got a nickel?
- Yeah, sure.
The name is Miss Lily Stevens.
That's right.
She'll be over in a little while.
Okay, kid. Thanks.
- I got Lily a room.
- Antlers Hotel, room 12, large double.
- Same old room?
- Aw, now, Pete.
- Don't you ever learn?
- But this gal is different.
What's the matter with the hometown talent?
They're easy to handle.
Last year those entertainers from Kansas City,
St. Louis- Remember the trouble?
- Now, wait-
- Okay, you're the boss.
But don't ask me to dump 'em when you're tired.
Tired?
Pete, you don't understand.
I can't get anywhere near Lily.
- How much do we pay her?
- Two-fifty.
Two-fifty? And I'm supposed to make this place show a profit?
- There goes my percentage.
- But if she don't deliver, she goes.
Yeah, boy she must have been hard to get.
- How many weeks?
- Six.
But as I said, if she don't deliver, she has to go.
Six weeks.
Oh, come on, now.
Stop spoiling my fun.
I know I shouldn't mix business with pleasure. That's why I've got you around.
Hey, come on.
- Hey, Jefty.
- Yeah?
- Miller wants to see you in the poolroom.
- Okay.
Go on inside and get friendly.
You made a bad impression.
Hey, Art. GetJefty's station wagon around the front.
- Ah, ah.
- Got to cheat a little, Sam.
Your troubles are over, Miss Stevens.
Gonna be all taken care of.
- The Antlers?
- Yeah, Antlers Hotel. Nice, big room.
Antlers? Guess this is a moose trap all around.
"Moose trap".
- That's good.
- That's terrific.
- Thanks, Sam. See you later.
- Good luck.
Oh, Miss Stevens,
I'll see you out front.
- I'll get your bags.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, Susie, what do you think of this one?
She's something, isn't she?
If you like the sound of gravel.
Uh, tell me. Think I'm gonna like this rattrap we're going to?
The Antlers? You betcha.
It's a swell place.
It's got a dining room, plenty of class- Everything.
And besides that, it's the only hotel in town.
That does it.
- Where's Lily?
- Pete took her to the hotel.
- Took her to the hotel? What for?
- I don't know.
I really don't know.
I just work here.
Gimme a brandy, will ya, Sam?
Say!
She's pretty nice, isn't she?
I'll say she is.
What, are you talking to yourself?
I don't get it.
I don't get it at all.
- What happened?
- Search me, boss.
This is something new-
Pete being nice to an entertainer.
Yeah.
- What's this?
- The depot.
- Yeah. That's where I came in.
- Yeah, that's where you're going out.
Now look, Miss Stevens, let's not kid each other.
As I said, it's small pickings in this town.
Now, here's a couple of hundred bucks and some extra.
I think that'll square us for your trouble.
Yeah, that's better.
You see, every time
Jefty leaves town... he gets drunk and brings somebody back.
Oh, he does? Does he know you're going to all this trouble?
No, but he'll find out it's for the better, and so will you.
- Supposing I don't want to go?
- Yeah, but you will.
You see, Jefty gets tired easily... then it's up to me to do the dumping.
I don't like it, but if I have to
I can get rough.
Oh, you can? Huh.
Well, this should really buy me off, shouldn't it?
I thought you'd be as smart as you look.
Listen. When I want to leave,
I'll let you know.
I came out here with a contract.
I needed the dough.
And I'm gonna collect every nasty little cent of it. Maybe more.
Who knows? Before I'm through, you might be running for the depot.
Don't try to borrow two bits from me when you shove off.
Now look, baby,
I'm not trying to rush you.
Silly boy.
- So that's Jefty's new attraction.
- Not so bad.
- When's she supposed to give out?
- Pete says tonight.
She reminds me of the first woman that ever slapped my face.
- If she sings like she looks-
- You wouldn't let me wear a dress like that.
How's the take tonight, honey?
- We can use Lily if she's good.
- She'll be good.
Oh, Pete, look, uh-
I wanna do this right.
Give Lily a break, you know what I mean?
- Lights out, spotlight. Okay?
- Give her the works.
Okay, good.
Folks, uh, I'd like you to meet... our new entertainer, from Chicago-
Miss Lily Stevens.
Lily?
Arpeggios]
It's quarter to 3:00
There's no one in the place
Except you and me
So set 'em up, Joe
I've got a little story you ought to know
We're drinking, my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more
For the road
I've got the routine
So drop another nickel
In the machine
I'm feelin'so bad
Wish you'd make the music
Dreamy and sad
Could tell you a lot
But you've gotta be true to your code
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it
But, buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy
You've simply gotta listen to me
Until it's talked away
Well, that's how it goes
And, Joe, I know you're getting anxious to close
So thanks for the cheer
Hope you didn't mind my
Bending your ear
This torch that I've found
Must be drowned
Or it soon might explode
Make it one for my baby
And one more
For the road
That long
Oh, that long
Long road
Is she good?
She does more without a voice than anybody I've ever heard.
Honey, you were wonderful.
- Terrific.
- Oh, you're crazy, you know that?
Come on, give 'em another one, huh, baby?
Blues]
- Well, wise guy, is she good?
- She's good.
And littleJefty did it.
Don't forget that.
She'll be the biggest hit we ever had.
She'll double our business in the bar.
Well, come on. Admit it.
- I admit it.
- You know what I think I'll do?
I'll knock out that wall in the back, and I'll double the bar.
- Now, wait a minute.
- We'll have the swellest joint west of Chicago.
- Don't lose your head, Jefty.
- Two-fifty? Ho, ho.
She's a steal.
You know, I'm beginning to get interested in this business.
Lily, how about a double, on the house?
- No thanks, Sam. Bad for my voice.
- You were great.
- Surprised?
- To tell the truth, I was.
Oh? So was I.
You're a terrific tonic for lonely people, Sam.
- Good to talk to.
- Yeah.
Everybody's lonely.
Now, there's a guy comes in here every night... takes that stool at the end of the bar-
Miss Stevens, you're good.
You're a hit.
- I don't have to tell you they like you.
- Fine. And you?
- Best we ever had.
- Think I'm worth the money?
I've got to admit, Jefty's got the top end of the bargain.
Still want to rush me out of town? Hmm?
Now look, I said I made a mistake.
- I'm sorry.
- Okay. Think nothing of it.
Come on, kids. Let's laugh it off.
Sam, bring us a special, huh?
No, thanks. I gotta count up the profits.
Hmm.
I love that guy. He's a great kid.
- Don't get him wrong.
- Oh, I don't.
Well, who do I get my weekly check from, you or bashfulJoe?
BashfulJoe.
- You know, he's not gonna like that.
- So what?
Tell me, Jefty, what do you do around here between songs, hmm?
Anything you like to do, honey.
Just name it.
Oh, I don't know. For laughs, how about me learning how to bowl?
- Sure.
- Who's the coach?
- Coach? Susie.
- Oh.
Honey, I've got the greatest coach in the world for you.
You know, I'm going to love this.
You just leave it toJefty.
You're a million laughs, you know that?
Again
This couldn't happen
Again
This is that once
In a lifetime
This is the thrill
Divine
And what's more
This never happened
Before
Though I have prayed
For a lifetime
That such as you
Would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold
As I'm holding you now
And yet
Never so near
Mine to have
And the now and the here
Disappear
But then
If this doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment
Forever
But never
Ever again
You sore about something, Pete?
You hit 'em like you mean it.
Well, Jefty's bound to find a singer once in a while.
- Not bad. Not bad at all.
- Donna, what do I have to do to beat Fred?
Fair, anyway. I don't like her.
That's the first time I ever interrupted a game for anything.
- I like it.
- There's still no excuse for that dress.
What did you say her name is?
You see that mob, kid?
I told you she'd double our business at the bar.
Don't tell me I didn't make a good deal.
Did you?
How you doing?
I can wait.
May be a long wait.
Got nothing else to do.
Serious?
Maybe. Oh, honey.
Pete, got a grand job for you.
Lily wants to learn how to bowl.
And here's the boy who can teach you.
Best bowler in the state.
And the best instructor.
- Oh, I'm afraid not.
- Why not?
I've got too much work to do.
What are you doing now?
Keeping the alleys warm.
- Don't bother. So I take up knitting.
- Wait a minute.
Pete, I asked you to teach Lily.
For me.
I don't ask you much.
This is something I want you to do.
- Now, look-
- Am I that hard to take?
I didn't say you were.
Okay then, it's all settled.
I knew you would.
Anytime when you're not busy.
Around noon?
Okay. Around noon.
Fix her up with a pair of shoes, will ya, Pete?
And, uh, you need slacks.
Something like that.
I know how to dress.
You kill me.
Again
Form is important in bowling, like in everything else.
There are three kinds of rolls.
The straight roll-
Keep the thumb straight.
- Fascinated?
- Oh!
I was just watching.
Don't break your glasses.
You aim down the right side of the alley toward the center.
Watch.
- You try it.
- Okay.
Well- Nothing to it.
See what I mean?
No, you've got the idea.
Now there's the backup ball.
The backup ball is thrown to the Brooklyn side of the pin, and backs up into the pocket.
- You get it?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
Try it.
Okay.
Well, here we go.
Backup ball.
That was great, wasn't it?
- If you say I've got the idea again-
- But you have got the idea.
Now we'll try to throw a curve.
That ought to be easy for you.
The curve is thrown like a hook.
- May I ask you a simple question?
- Yeah, if it's simple.
Why don't you stop fighting me?
I won't bite.
Who's fighting?
You're fighting the ball.
- You're overdoing it, that's all.
- Give me the ball.
- Kid lives dangerously, doesn't he?
- You know any other sports?
Never mind.
Come on. Try it again.
All right.
Only this time, would you mind grabbing me when I throw the ball?
I have a knack of going halfway down the alley with it.
You should have worn the shoes I got you.
How was that?
You need a rest.
I'll get a drink. Some water.
- Hi, Susie.
- Hi.
- Sleep well?
- Beautifully. And you?
After those hamburgers?
Straight water so early in the day?
Was this what you had to do that was so important?
I didn't say it was important.
Oh, thanks.
Uh, she comes to work early, doesn't she?
- She's a hard worker.
- Mm-hmm.
She looks tired.
This one's going to be a straight ball.
Okay, coach.
- Straight.
- Straight.
I think I get the idea.
- Good morning, Miss McGuinness.
- Hello, Jimmy.
The only trouble with your cabin, Jefty-
It's too close to Canada.
You shoot 'em and they beat it for the border.
And besides, when that fog rolls in from the lake...
- Where you going?
- I'm having breakfast upstairs.
Wait for me.
Maybe she won't think it's so romantic-
7:00 on a Sunday morning.
Mmm.
Who is it?
What are you doing here? Get out.
Wait a minute, Lily. Don't get sore.
- I brought you breakfast.
- You heard me. I said get out.
What, do you think you own this town or something?
I don't like people busting in my room.
I wasn't sure what you like, so I got the works.
Here. Smell this coffee.
Mmm! What a way to start the day.
Breakfast in bed.
Listen, Jefty, you better read our contract again.
There's nothing about breakfast in Lily's room.
- You know, you smoke too much.
- I know. So what?
Nothing.
This is the first time
I ever did this for a girl.
Thought you might like it.
What you all dressed up for?
- I'm going hunting.
- Oh.
That's, uh-That's what I came to tell you, Lily.
I'll be gone most of the week.
Come on. How about eating something?
- It's good for you.
- Yeah.
I'm still asleep.
What time is it?
I think you got a screw loose somewhere.
7:00, and I didn't sleep well.
Oh, that feels good.
Lily, we'll have a real party when I get back.
I don't like parties.
I, uh- I wanted to tell you something before I went away, but-
Now I don't know how.
It's just that-
Well, you're not like any girl
I've ever met before.
I don't know how to handle it.
I don't know how to say it either.
It's just that-
Well, you're different, that's all.
Uh-huh. How different?
Maybe I can prove it to you someday.
- Prove what?
- The difference.
Why didn't you tell me bowling could make you this sore, huh?
Don't you like bowling either?
No. Not yet, anyway.
- Maybe you'll learn.
- Uh-uh.
Well, so long.
Sorry I busted in on you.
Aw, that's all right.
Thanks for the breakfast.
Hey.
And the flowers.
I could have said something about the flowers, couldn't I?
Forget it. Bye.
Hi.
I've just been spoiling all your alleys for you.
How'd you get in?
Simple. I used to pick locks when I was a kid.
- Did I wake you up?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry. Go on back to bed.
Thanks.
Come in.
Are you decent?
Uh-uh. Nobody's ever accused me of it.
I thought I'd dig us up some breakfast.
Hey, that's a nice outfit.
- But you'd better add to it before you go to church.
- What have I done to deserve all this?
- Nothing.
Just goes to prove what a nice kid I am.
Yeah, it smells good.
Mmm. Tastes good.
Tell me, uh, what do you do around here on a Sunday?
Go for boat rides. Swimming.
- Oh, you got a boat?
- Jefty's.
Fine. That solves all our problems.
- No, it doesn't.
- Why not?
- Look, do we have to spoil this nice breakfast?
- What do you mean?
You ever lived in a small town before?
What's that got to do with it? What's wrong with going out on the lake in broad daylight?
Nothing. It's wonderful, and I'm going.
But you'reJefty's girl, so you're not going.
Oh. What did the two of you do, flip a coin and decide that?
He set you up at the Antlers. He's paying for it.
Got it all figured out, haven't you?
You know something? You're stupid.
Now, look.
Doesn't it ever enter a man's head that a woman can do without him?
Listen, all I wanted to do was just hang around with somebody on a dull Sunday.
I get that low sometimes.
So you just skip it.
Hop in your little boat. Paddle off.
Me- I'll go back to the alley.
Hey, legs.
I'll pick you up about 11:00, okay?
Okay. I'll make some sandwiches.
I'm good at that too.
- Surprised?
- I'm surprised at nothing.
- Better make plenty. I get awfully hungry.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm. Ready?
- Sure.
- There's a basket.
- Let's go.
What'd you say?
Uh-oh.
That's why I said to make plenty.
Susie's always hungry.
Yeah. You could figure her for a big appetite.
- Well, hello. This is a surprise.
- Hello yourself.
Hey, that's a nice outfit.
Going somewhere?
Sharp, isn't she?
- Come on. It's all yours.
- Oh, thanks.
- Got your suit?
- What kind of suit?
Swimming. You know, splash, splash.
We got ours under the rags.
Oh. We going swimming?
I thought you said the boat.
- Want me to run upstairs and get yours?
- No. Haven't got one.
Would you care to borrow one of mine?
No thanks. Don't think it would fit.
Anyway, I don't like swimming.
Come on, girls.
Too nice a day to argue.
Hey, Pete, I'll race you.
I did it!
Hey, Lily. Build us a castle in the sand.
You go build your own castle, kid.
Hey! Hey!
How is it down there, eh?
Two can play at that game.
Oh, no, you don't.
- Fresh.!
- Here. I'll get you for that.
Here you go then- No, sir.
Oh, Pete.!
Not again. Oh, Pete.
You're much stronger than I am.
It's not fair.
Oh, Pete.
- Don't take it out on me.
- Will you behave yourself? Will you be good?
No.
- Hey, Pete.
- Huh?
The girlfriend's gone.
Hey, look what she did with a couple of half hitches.
Can I have some fun too?
I thought you said you couldn't swim.
Oh, I didn't say that. Did I, Pete?
Just said I didn't like swimming, that's all.
Why don't I drown myself, now that the water's handy?
Huh?
Don't trouble to get out.
I don't know when I've had more fun.
We must do it again soon.
- Next time, don't bother to dress.
Just come as you are. - Aw.
- You know something, Pete?
- What?
Imagine bringing a girl all the way from Chicago to wear me out.
Blues]
There's only one kind of lovin'
One kind of kissin'
The right kind
Oh, the right kind
There's only one kind of lovin'
That I've been missin'
The right kind
I'm tired of too many guys
With casual eyes
I know their line from "A" to "Z"
Oh, I want a man who is my kind of man
Daddy-o, where can you be
There's only one kind of heaven
Breakfast at 7:00
The right kind
Oh, the right kind
There's only one kind of livin'
Worth all the givin'
The right kind
I got the word from my heart
I heard from my heart
And I find that we agree
There's only one kind of lovin'
The right kind of lovin'
Your kind
My kind
That's the kind of lovin' for me
Aw, get out of here.
- Hi, baby.
- Hi. Hi.
You ain't goin' anywhere.
Don't you think we're being just a little intimate?
- Hey, what's the idea? Take it easy.
- Sam.!
- Aw, let her alone.
- Listen, we hardly know each other.
Give me the police.
- Get out of here!
- Do something.
Get out! Get out of here.
Get over there.!
Go on.! Get out.
Get out!
Pete. Pete!
Trouble in the bar. Quick!
Everybody out! Get out.
Pal, you need a drink.
Look out, Pete.
Pete.! Look out, Pete.
Dutch- Playin' bad boy again, huh?
- He's just a little plastered.
- Who'd he murder?
- Nobody. Wasn't because he didn't try.
- You're lucky.
Come on, get out.
Don't forget I got a big blackjack here...
- that just loves that thick skull of yours.
- Thanks for coming.
- Hereafter, whenever he shows up, call first. Don't wait. - Okay.
- Pete, you all right?
- Yeah.
- Here. Let me take care of you.
- No, that's okay.
- You're okay, Pete.
- Nice work, bud.
Goodjob, Pete.
Pete?
- Thanks.
- How do you feel?
- Oh, like I got a seagull with a broken wing in my head.
- Mind if I go up and rest?
- No, go ahead. It's open.
Okay.
Hey. You know, you were terrific.
Gee, Pete, you almost took that bottle neat.
Let that be a lesson to you.
Stay on the wagon.
- Oh, boy. You better get that fixed.
- Yeah.
Come in.
- Oh, hi.
- How's everything?
Okay. Here, let me look after that for you.
No, that's okay.
Fix us something, will you?
- Straight?
- Straight.
All right.
- Is everybody all right?
- Fine.
Not me.
I feel as though I'd fought the good fight myself.
- Can I join you?
- Sure. Here we are.
- Thank you.
- Susie, Cash.
I think you're being paged, honey.
My hero.
Susie? Susie, Cash.
"Susie, Cash".
It's the story of my life.
Well.
- Hey, how did it start?
- Oh, simple.
Just came over, lifted me and the piano.
Nothing to it.
Opera]
Competition.
I guess my old man wanted me to sound like that.
He used to say to me,
"Lil, someday you're gonna sing at the Met-
Heavy opera".
He called it heavy instead of grand.
He played the foot organ.
Won it in a poker game.
But he'd say to me,
"Lil, you gotta practice.
Study hard, day and night".
So in the daytime
I worked in a factory.
At night I'd study-
Practice while he played the foot organ.
Well, by the time I got good enough to sing Madame Butterfly-
What do you know?
I lost my voice.
We're not kidding ourselves anymore, are we?
What brought this on?
It was worth it.
- Hiya, Skipper.
- Hi.
How do you feel?
I feel good.
- What are you thinkin' about?
- Oh, nothing much.
I was just thinking that all my life
I've been on the go-
Living with the smell of stale smoke... lot of drunks breathing down my back.
Always on my own.
- What about your old man?
- Oh, him? He was great.
Only trouble was, when he was sober he hardly recognized me.
But I loved him.
Yeah, one day he blew.
My mother died. I was alone.
And a friend took care of me.
I love you, Lil.
How long have you known Jefty?
Oh, way back before the war.
Jefty and I were pinboys together.
OnlyJefty's father owned the place.
Well, why did you come back here after the war?
No ties.
Jefty, the roadhouse-
It was home, that's all.
Are you gonna let him run your life always?
Oh, you don't understand.
Jefty needs to have somebody around. He-
He needs a friend.
Nobody's all good.
Nobody's all bad.
I'll never forget the look on his face... when you said you wouldn't teach me to bowl.
It was just as if he could have killed you.
Nah.
He's just a spoiled guy.
Is he?
So am I, Pete.
Oh-
I want you to need me.
Have you ever really wanted anything?
- I mean- I mean besides Jefty and the roadhouse?
- Yeah.
I've always wanted to own a fishing boat... somewhere off the Portland coast.
You know, it's cold up there.
The wind bites your face.
Fishing boat.
Bowling alley sounds a long way off.
Aw, I'll bet you think I'm crazy.
No. No, I don't.
I'd like to be in on that fishing deal with you.
Ten to one I'll make a rotten sailor though.
I'll take that bet.
Sorry, Mr. Robbins.
She doesn't answer.
She doesn't?
Well, when she comes in, have her call me at my house right away, will you?
Yes, sir.
When did she go out?
I don't think she came in at all this evening, not while I was here.
Okay, thanks.
Hi, Jefty.
- Hi, honey.
- Just get back?
- Mm-hmm. Where's Lily?
- I don't know.
- The place is closed tonight. Monday, remember?
- Aw, yeah, that's right.
- And you haven't seen her, huh?
- No.
- Pete and I were at the movies.
- Oh, yeah?
- Did you get a moose?
- Mm-hmm.
Three. One for each of us.
Another year, another moose head in the bar, another Lily.
- When are you gonna grow up, Jefty?
- Oh, I'm a big boy now.
- You driving back to the place?
- Mm-hmm.
- I wanna talk to Pete.
- Can I go with you?
- Sure. Come on.
- I wanna check up on something.
Okay. Slide in.
Hey, baby, Jefty's here.
You took me to the movies tonight.
We saw a Western.
Thanks, kid.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Hi, Jefty.
- Hi, kid. Good to see you.
Hey, who told Sam to lock up?
I've been drinking sherry.
Aaah! Take me upstairs and give me a drink, will ya?
- Why didn't you go up? My place is always open.
- I don't know.
- I must be too wacky to remember.
- Wacky about what?
I'll tell you. How's Lily?
- Fine.
- You two still fighting?
- How's her bowling?
- No, we're not fighting.
- Any luck at the cabin?
- Yeah.
But my mind wasn't on it.
I, uh-
I've got something to show you, Pete.
You're gonna think I'm crazy, but I did it.
Did what?
The last thing I ever thought I'd do.
Well, it happens to everybody once, they say.
I went away to make up my mind... and I did.
What made you do it, Jefty?
I don't know.
Do you love her?
All I know is she makes me think about things...
I used to laugh at.
You didn't know
I could feel that way, did you?
Well, neither did I.
But I'm tired of fooling around, Pete.
Tired of living alone.
I want-
I want Lily.
Anything wrong in that?
- That depends.
- Yeah, I know.
It depends on the way I want her.
Okay. I want to-
I wanna make things good for her.
I want to take her out of dives.
I want her for my wife.
You seem awful sure she'll accept, Jefty.
Don't forget, she's a funny girl.
- Independent.
- Yeah, she's independent.
But all gals want the same thing, Pete- a guy to take care of them.
I can take care of Lily.
I want to.
Where is she?
- Did she go out?
- With whom?
That's right, with whom.
Well, I gotta hurry. I told her to call me when she came in.
You better find yourself a gal, kid.
You're next.
Susie.
Lily? Why didn't you call me?
I've got news for you.
I told you I'd prove how I felt about you.
We're getting married.
I've got the license right here in my pocket.
Jefty, you're kidding.
You must be out of your mind. I...
- I never told you that-
- I knew you wouldn't believe it.
Just a second, Jefty.
Hello, honey.
Pete, it's Jefty.
He's got a marriage license.
- Yeah, I know.
- What right has he to-
Hello? Hello?
Yeah. Yeah, go on.
So, uh, I thought we'd take the boat and go up to the lake tomorrow.
You know, a little celebration.
We could have lunch at the Swede's.
Sure. Sure, okay.
Hello?
Hello? Lily?
Operator? Operator?
Miss Stevens hung up.
Do you want me to call her back?
No. One thrill at a time.
Yes, but how can we tell him?
It isn't that simple. I know Jefty.
He won't just smile and slap us on the back.
But I've got to tell him, honey.
It's a rotten job to tell your best friend you've cut him out.
But you haven't, Pete.
He has no right, no right at all.
All I ever did was put him off from the beginning.
Oh, baby.
All my life, I've been fighting for this.
I don't want it to be spoiled.
Let's pack and leave right now, huh?
Oh, I can't do that, Lil. Don't worry.
I'll go and tell him, and I'll be right back.
- Let me go with you.
- No, it's better alone.
Pete.
Be careful.
I'll be back.
- Hi, Pete. Come on in.
- Thanks.
What's the matter?
Uh, I've got to talk to you.
Sure. I'm glad you woke me up.
Every time I sleep on that thing,
I get a bad back for a week.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
What's the trouble, kid?
Well, this isn't easy, Jefty. I...
Something happened while you were away that I never figured would happen.
I never wanted to happen.
What? Somebody offer you another job?
I-I wish it were as simple as that.
I'm in love with Lily, and she's in love with me. We're gonna get married.
I would have told you before, but-
- Married?
- I'm sorry, Jefty, believe me.
But Lily isn't just another girl for me.
It's my life and hers.
- Jefty, we know each other too well. I...
- Do we?
I don't know you.
Get out.
Get out of here.
I don't want to see you.
I don't want you around.
- It's her choice.
- Get out!
Okay.
Get out. Get out. Get out.
I got tickets to Chicago.
We'll decide from there.
Remember the last time we were here?
I wouldn't even give you two bits to get out of town.
- Smart, wasn't I?
- And I was a couple of hundred bucks smarter.
Yeah.
Pete, are you sorry aboutJefty?
Well, just that a guy likes to wind up a friendship with a handshake.
Yeah.
- Are you Pete Morgan?
- Yeah.
- Will you come with us, please? You too, miss.
- Well, why?
- What's it about?
- Routine investigation.
Pete Morgan, Captain.
- What's all this about, Captain?
- Sit down.
You too, Miss- Stevens, is it?
Mr. Robbins.
Morgan...
Mr. Robbins here claims that the week's receipts...
ofhis roadhouse were taken from his safe tonight.
You were at that safe.
Here's your note.
I took $600 coming to me, that's all.
I don't say that you took anything, Pete.
All I know is that the week's receipts... should have been there, and they're not.
- We bank tomorrow.
- How much money is there usually in the safe?
I don't know.
Pete and Susie handle the money.
Pete. Lily. What happened?
- Miss Smith?
- Yes.
Sit down.
- You're the cashier at Mr. Robbins'roadhouse?
- That's right.
How much money would you say was in the safe tonight?
Well, the week's receipts.
$2,600. We keep the overage in small bills in the bar.
How do you know there was 2,600 in the safe?
Because I checked the weekly receipts on Sunday... and gave them to Pete- Mr. Morgan.
You gave Mr. Morgan 2,600 in cash?
Yes, in an envelope sealed with my name on it.
What's wrong?
Who else knows the combination to the safe?
Only Pete and myself.
- You know I didn't take that money.
- Just a second, Morgan.
You'll get a chance to speak.
Miss Stevens, were you with Morgan at the roadhouse... when he opened the safe?
- No.
- Pete's always been careful with the-
Just a moment, please.
Did you take the rest of that 2,000?
- I told you, no.
- Mr. Robbins knows he hasn't.
- Where were you going when you were stopped?
- I don't know.
Chicago first.
- Mr. Robbins had discharged you tonight?
- That's right.
You plead innocent and can't produce the money?
I don't plead anything.
I'm telling you, I didn't take that money!
I took $600 coming to me, and no more.
I'll have to hold you, Morgan.
Pete didn't take that money.
Why, he wouldn't-
This complaint doesn't name you, Miss Smith.
Nor you, Miss Stevens.
You're both free to go.
- All right, Morgan.
- Wait a minute.
Jefty, what good do you think this is gonna do you?
Pete!
Don't just walk out and let him frame you. Don't, Pete.
Tell them why he's doing it.
You no-good swine.
You dirty little swine!
You framed him.
- But you're not gonna get away with it.
- That will do, Miss Stevens.
What do you mean, that will do?
Why don't you search him?
You'd do anything, wouldn't you?
Anything to get even with Pete.
Take it easy, kid. You're upset.
You don't know what you're saying.
Don't give me that!
You know what I'm saying.
But you haven't worked out the finish yet, have you, Jefty?
You haven't worked out the end of it, and that's what's going to hurt- hurt hard!
Lily, honey, come on.
The cops don't know.
You're a bad loser!
But I'll get a lawyer to fight you, Jefty.
- I still can't believe it myself.
- You never know.
You sure don't.
Pete was my best friend.
Oh, we had fights, sure, but it never came to anything like- like stealing.
Maybe he was drunk, Captain.
Did you check that?
Mr. Robbins, I deal with situations exactly like this... day in and day out five times every day... thirty-five times a week.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess you do.
"Verdict Awaited in Roadhouse Theft Today".
Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, Your Honor.
The jury finds the defendant guilty of grand larceny.
The clerk will record the verdict.
The court will pronounce sentence at 2:00 this afternoon.
And when the war was over, we came back home together.
Home was the roadhouse... the only home Pete's ever known.
I'm all the family he ever had.
And what did I do for Pete?
I had the money. He had nothing.
I couldn't have run the place without Pete.
Yet, all I gave him was a salary and a small percentage... after 10 years.
Don't you see, Judge? I should have had enough sense to know that there was- there was something burning inside of him.
Well, he got to feeling worse and worse.
Started drinking, taking my girls.
You can't blame him.
Then one night he gets drunk... decides to clean the safe.
What about this girl- Miss Stevens?
She's nothing to me.
I haven't anything against Lily.
What do you want, Mr. Robbins?
I want you to give Pete a chance.
Give me a chance to show him that I'm a decent guy.
Parole him to me.
- It was your charge that put this man in jail.
- Yes, I know.
I-I lost my head. I was hurt.
But I was all wrong, Judge.
I ask you to parole him to me.
Come to order, please.
Everybody rise.
Be seated, please.
Is the defendant ready for sentence?
We're ready, Your Honor.
Peter Morgan... for the crime of which you stand convicted... you are hereby sentenced to serve in the penitentiary of this state...
for a term of not less than two years, nor more than 10 years.
Order.
Sentence suspended... under the following conditions.
It is the duty of the law to temperjustice with mercy... when the situation warrants.
The complainant, Mr. Robbins... has come forward with an unusual and most generous offer.
It is Mr. Robbins'opinion- and the court...
after listening to the evidence, concurs-
that the crime at worst was the impulse of a moment.
The defendant has a clean record.
He's a friend and employee oflong standing of Mr. Robbins... who appealed to the court for mercy.
The defendant is therefore put on probation... in the care of Mr. Robbins... for the period of his suspended sentence- two years.
The normal conditions of probation will prevail.
If Morgan violates his probation...
ifhe tries to leave the state or commits another crime...
this court will sentence him to the limit of its power...
and remand him to the penitentiary...
for the full term ofhis sentence as provided by law.
Mr. Robbins has agreed to restore Morgan to his old position...
and deduct the amount of the theft in question...
over the period of probation.
Court adjourned.
A nice thing to do would be to go over and shake hands with Robbins.
Oh, you don't have to.
He's coming over here.
Come on, kid. We're going home.
- Nice going.
- Clear the court.!
- ThatJefty's a good egg down deep.
- Pete!
Pete deserves it.
Anybody can lose his head over a gal like Lily.
Well, this guy- Let me see.
What was his name?
Oh, yeah, Chubby. Chubby Shell.
Well, Chubby gets sore, and he decides to put a 50-buck bet on the strike.
He shoots and he leaves a pin.
Of course, everybody yells, when all of a sudden... when the ball's dead and the frame is over... for no reason at all the pin drops.
- What happened?
- No kidding. What did Chubby do?
Let me tell you. I found out about it afterwards.
The pin boy had a piece of the fifty-buck bet, and he nudged it over.
- Did they let it ride?
- Why, sure.
For 50 bucks, it was a sympathy strike.
- Honey, I'll take this. You relax.
- Oh, by golly.
I'll never forget
Mike Travis up at the cabin.
Hey, Pete, remember the time we put that stuffed moose head...
up in the cabin in the bush, and Mike kept shooting at it?
- Tell them about it.
- No, you tell them, Jefty. I need a refill.
- Okay.
- Pete, how do you feel?
- I don't know yet.
- Mike kept blazing away at it.
But the moose head only nodded to him because we had it tied in with wire.
And the sorer Mike got-
Oh, baby.
I don't get it, Lil.
Why did he do it?
I don't know.
There's something wrong about it, but I just don't know what.
Maybe we're crazy, honey.
Maybe the guy's had a change of heart.
Maybe a million things.
But we're together. That's the main thing.
- I'd like to believe that.
- Well, that's what we're gonna believe.
And we'll get married.
Will you marry a guy on probation?
What do you think?
Hi, kids.
Having fun?
Thought you were gonna refill?
- So I was.
- Swell party, huh?
- What a day. Perfect.
- Almost.
- Almost? Anything wrong?
- You got Pete free.
Why don't you go the rest of the way and find the money?
That's all it takes, Jefty.
I don't want a prison record.
Kids, I wish I could.
Jefty, we've all done something one time or another we were ashamed of.
You're no exception.
But to make it good-That's what counts.
- Forget it, Lily.
- You know you can.
- Cut it out, I say.
- Anyway, what difference does it make now?
We're just one big happy family.
Lily singing in the bar,
Pete living upstairs.
Just the way it was.
We're twins from now on, kid.
Where I go, you go.
And just suppose I was mean.
Suppose you tried to marry Pete and leave town.
Or suppose you got mad and tried to slug me.
One word to the judge, and that's all, brother.
Ten years in the pen.
Oh, what a setup.
What's the big joke? Let me in on it.
They'll tell you.
They'll tell you all about it.
What's eating him?
So that's what it was.
That's what he planned all the time.
Someday, I'll choke that laugh.
Again
This couldn't happen
Again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine
That new stuff for the alley's poolroom's coming in tomorrow.
Think I'll get the place painted, do it up.
In the meantime, we'll take a little vacation.
My cabin. Lily and you and me.
Something's wrong with Lily.
Her voice doesn't sound the same.
Susie, how would you like to spend a few days at my cabin... with Lily and Pete and me?
- I can't go, Jefty.
- Why not?
I don't see any sense to it.
You don't see any sense to it, huh?
I told you, where I go, you've got to go.
You're tied to me.
- How about you?
- Sure.
Okay. We'll use my boat, climb to the cabin on the other side.
You be at the dock at 8:00 tomorrow.
Pete-
Lily, Jefty just arranged for the four of us to go away tomorrow.
His cabin. You better go talk to Pete. He's upstairs.
- Don't let him-
- What's wrong?
I don't know.
But don't let him make a break.
You're the only one that can stop him.
- Pete.
- Get your things packed. We're leaving.
No, baby. We packed once before, and where did it get us?
Look, I've had my stomach full. I'm going.
- Now, you're coming with me, or I'm going alone.
- Sure. Go on alone.
Now, look. The Canadian border's only 15 miles from here.
Whatever happens, it's better than this.
I tell you, Lil, if I stay here another day, I'll-
Kill him, huh? That's great.
So that's what you've been thinking about.
He can even make you do that to get back at you.
- Don't be a fool. He won't stop at anything.
- You're not making any sense.
You're drunk. Either you're coming with me, or shut up and get out.
Pete, I know what I'm talking about.
You're letting a crazy man likeJefty ruin our lives.
Leave me alone and get out!
Sure. I'm sorry I left a good drink to come up here.
You're not worth it.
I hate you, Pete.
Hate you for making me need your help.
I was crazy for ever banking my life on you.
Oh, baby.
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, baby.
You're right, Lil. This is what he wanted- to make us hate each other.
For me to make a break.
Well, how cozy.
What's the help doing now?
It was like a morgue downstairs.
I was bored.
Really? So are the customers.
Why don't you go down and make some noise. Try a little song.
Pick up the grub from the kitchen and put it on the boat, will you?
- You like the way I'm stringing along, Jefty?
- Very nice. Very nice.
That's the way it's supposed to be, isn't it, kid?
I don't know. I don't know.
I'll tell you one thing for sure, Jefty.
If I am stringing along, it's because I want to.
And don't go too far, Jefty.
Don't go one inch too far... because I may wanna do something else.
Man, what a life. What a life. Hey, Susie, get me another bottle on the shelf, huh?
Yes, sir, this is livin'.
Real livin'. Didn't I tell you?
Huh?
Now you're talkin'.
Set it right down here. That's it, Susie.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
What's the matter?
Nobody drinking but me?
Come on. Join the fun.
Suckers.
Mmm. Ahh.
Lily- Pete- Pete, I want you to see something.
I want you to see something.
I want you to take a look at this map. There.
Now, you go through about a couple of miles... of the prettiest woods you ever saw.
Then two miles of peaceful river.
And what have you got? Canada.
It's even prettier over there.
The smell of open fields and flow-
By golly, I just remembered. I still got that little outboard motor on the river for fishing.
Remember, kid?
Where you going?
- Outside, get some air.
- Air.
Okay, let's all go out.
How's the moon?
Beautiful. Let's do a little shooting.
You ever see me shoot?
I'm good. Very good.
You don't want to shoot now, Jefty.
You're better at talking.
- Why don't you tell us the story of your life?
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh.
That moon's too good.
Can't miss a shot.
Remember, baby, I promised to teach you- Never mind that.
Okay, beautiful.
On second thought, you wouldn't like Canada anyway...
not enough to spend the rest of your life there.
Not even if they let you.
Not even with Pete.
Lay off, will you, Jefty?
Have a heart, or give us a rest.
Now, Susie, you shouldn't talk that way to me.
Everybody out! Jefty's gonna shoot.
Come on. Outside.
You stand over there.
Hey, Pete, how much did we pay for this tomato juice?
Well, it's gone now.
Too bad. Too bad.
Too bad. Too bad. Too... bad!
Hey! Fifty feet. Fifty feet.
I won't miss it.
I'm the best shot in the world.
And when I get drunk, I'm a better shot.
I'm a better shot.
The drunker I am, the better I get.
Now, you just get a load of this.
Watch it.
Now, just-just imagine that's a little duck up there.
A tiny little duck... waitin' for its mama.
Thought I was kidding, didn't you?
Well, now you know.
That was a good shot.
Pretty good shot.
Oh, that looks like blood.
Blood, huh? Blood. Yeah.
We better try somethin' else.
Let's see. What'll we try?
What'll we try-Ah, my hat.
Here, hold this.
I'll buy myself a new one.
We'll put the hat up on the branch like this.
There.
This is bigger, but it's tougher.
Pretty hard to see.
Go on, try it. See if you can hit it.
Go ahead, baby, try it.
That's it. Go on.
Take a crack at it.
Over. Over more.
Over more. No, over.
Over.!
What's the matter?
Couldn't you see it? Huh?
What'd you grab it for?
There wasn't anything in it.
Do you think I'd be silly enough to give her a loaded gun?
Let us go back, Jefty, or I swear I'll kill you.
Kill me? You'd kill me, baby?
If I get the chance.
Please, let us go back. Let us go back!
You know, it just comes to me.
I think you would like to kill me.
Oh, what a great couple you make.
A thief and a murderer.
A thief? What did you do with the money?
Buy the jury? It costs a lot to frame your best friend, doesn't it?
- You no-good, dirty little-
- Shut up!
I won't! You stole the money, and you know it.
You know it.
And you know something else, Jefty?
Your mind's gone.
You're crazy, Jefty.
Crazy!
You'll go to the pen where you belong.
- Pete!
- What's the answer now?
Make a break.
Ground fog's rolling in now.
- Get over the border, okay?
- Yeah, I'll go with you.
- Oh, don't do it. Use your heads.
- That's what I'm doing.
- It's all over now.
- Look, I can swear he hit you first.
What good'll that do? Come on.
Don't let him do it. Don't let him do it!
I don't care anymore. Even if we're caught, brought back, it's better this way.
It's a chance.
What chance will you have if they bring you back?
Now, wait a minute.
- Watch it, Lil.
- Okay.
There.
I'll get rid of the other gun in the brush.
Come on. Let's go.
Not me. You don't want any excess baggage where you're going.
- Susie, you can't stay here with him.
- Oh, don't worry.
- I'm not gonna stay.
- Kid, you get going now.
Thanks for everything.
You've been swell.
- Good luck to you, Lil. You got a wonderful guy.
- Susie, you've been-
- Go on if you're going.
- So long, Susie.
Good-bye.
Thanks, I will.
- Better let me go first. Stay right behind me.
- Yeah.
There's a kind of path here if we can hold it.
Don't worry about me.
Keep going fast as you can.
- Where are they?
- Gone.
- Where?
- Don't bother.
He broke your other little toy.
You're stuck without a gun, mister.
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
Don't lie to me!
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?
The border. That's where they'd go.
I'll get them.
- I'll get there before they do.
- That gun won't do you any good.
- They've got a long head start.
- I know these woods like a book.
Even if you catch them, it won't do any good.
You'll be the one who goes to jail, not Pete.
There's the proof.
Give me that envelope, or I'll kill ya.!
Susie, come back here!
Come back!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Can you keep on?
- Sure.
Wait a minute.
- What is it?
- Could beJefty.
Do you think he could possibly-
Yeah. He'd figure we'd make for the boat.
Let him come.
Maybe he found the gun in the brush, huh?
Maybe.
Listen. He's trying to cut us off.
We'd better hurry. If he gets to the river before we do, we're finished.
Okay, let's go.
There it is. The boat.
Quiet.
Pete! Pete!
Jefty's coming.
Here's the envelope.
The proof.
Jefty's not coming. He's here.!
- Susie, are you hit?
- Just my arm.
- Get going!
- Keep talkin', Susie.
It helps.
Unhitch it.
Hurry, Pete. Hurry.
You won't get very far without that engine. Paddle in!
I'll help put your fire out.
I'll put all your fires out!
All right, I'll take that envelope.
Give me that envelope!
The party's over.
- The party's over. The party's over.
- Stop it, Jefty.!
Get away from him.
Get away from him!
Let go ofhim, Jefty.
Let go, or I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.
You wouldn't kill me.
You- You can't kill Jefty.
You can't, Lily.
Oh, don't, Jefty.
Don't come any nearer. Don't!
- Give me that gun.
- No.
- Give it to me.
- No.
Jefty, stay away.
Stay away, or I swear I'll shoot you.
- Don't you understand? Please, I don't want to.
- Give it to me.
Keep away from me, Jefty!
Please keep away! Keep away!
Keep away.!
Lily.
I told you she was different.
It's all right, honey.
We'll send back for him.
Thanks, Pete.
I'm pretty heavy.
I guess it couldn't be helped.
It was always Jefty or us.
Yeah.
Come on, Lily.

(Narrator) The Wizard's men intercept a shipment of synthetic diamonds needed to operate their remote control machine.
Batman and Robin pursue the thieves.
Their car is disabled.
They commandeer another and...
Car 4 calling headquarters.
Headquarters. Come in, car 4.
There's another car trailing us.
Can you look it over through your televiewer?
Yes. Stand by.
[Electronic buzzing]
Batman and Robin are in that car.
Batman's too clever for his own good.
This time I'll do more than stop him.
This ought to be good.
[Machine whirring]
The Wizard has taken control.
Bail out.
[Crackling]
Keep down, the Wizard may be able to see us.
Headquarters to car 4, headquarters to car 4.
This is car 4.
Come in, headquarters.
Batman has been taken care of for good.
I've seen to it personally.
Good work.
Things ought to be different now, with Batman out of our hair.
They will be.
Yeah, it's a long walk back to where we left the car.
I hope it runs.
The wiring's probably burned out.
And we'll have to square things with that man whose car we took.
Any more worries?
I've persuaded commissioner
Gordon to let Jimmy Vale go, so we can watch him.
We haven't had much time to do that.
Maybe Vicki's keeping track of her brother.
I hope so.
I think we can take a chance now.
Hello. This is Jimmy Vale.
OK, Neil, rendezvous "D".
I'll be right over.
[Footsteps approaching]
Markham building.
[Engine starting]
Keep the change.
[Telephone ringing]
Mr. Wayne's residence.
Oh, this is Vicki Vale. I must speak to mr. Wayne at once.
I'm sorry, miss Vale, he's not at home.
Do you know where you can find him?
No, I don't. Do you wish to leave a message?
Yes, tell him that...
Oh, never mind.
[Machine humming]
Somebody's coming along the corridor towards the door.
See who it is.
It's Jimmy Vale.
He sure took his time.
What took you so long?
My sister Vicki dropped in.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
E. Certainly. Otherwise I wouldn't have come her sit down and relax.
We've got a big job coming up.
Any messages, Alfred?
(Alfred) Miss Vale called a little over an hour ago.
She seemed quite angry when she learned you were not at home.
Thanks.
I wonder What Vicki wanted. might be something about her brother.
I hope he doesn't get her in trouble.
[Machine humming]
Someone's snooping around this floor.
See who it is.
He doesn't stand still long enough.
Go out and look around.
Who are you looking for?
My brother.
We're just the boys who can take you to him.
[Knocking on door]
Vicki!
You sure fixed things.
Let her go. so she can bring the police?
Maybe she already has.
Lock her up in there.
Get outside and see if she did bring any cops.
[Telephone ringing]
Mr. Wayne's residence.
This is Vicki Vale.
Look, I'm a prisoner in a downtown office building.
Now, I want you to write down this address and give it to Bruce.
The number is...
[Footsteps approaching]
[Door opening]
How much longer am I to be held a prisoner here?
Nice try, sister, but don't try it again.
Somebody for me, Alfred?
Yes, it was miss Vale, sir, but she's no long er on the wire.
Why not?
Somebody forced her to hang up.
Where is she?
Well, she started to explain she was being held prisoner in some office building.
Then the connection was broken.
That building must be one of the Wizard's hideouts.
But how can we find it?
That last prisoner we caught should know where it is.
Getting him to reveal anything would be a man-sized job.
Yes, a Batman-sized job.
But it's our only hope.
Don't ask questions. Get in that delivery truck and take off.
[Engine starting]
Jason sure fell for that phony escape routine.
We can thank commissioner Gordon for helping us put it over.
I hope it helps us find Vicki.
This is Jason calling rendezvous C.
Jason calling rendezvous C.
Come in, rendezvous C.
He found the radio all right.
(Gabe) This is Gabe at rendezvous C.
I thought you were in the hoosegow, Jason.
I was, but I got out.
Where do I report?
Report to rendezvous "D".
Check.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
It's Jason.
Couldn't be, he's in jail.
Not now, he isn't.
He's right outside that door.
Let him in.
How'd you get here?
Well, don't you know? if I did, I wouldn't ask.
You mean you didn't have anything to do with my escape, or that getaway car?
Certainly not.
Someone's been playing games.
Well, it's not me.
[Machine humming]
Another visitor.
There's the answer.
Someone's tailed you here.
This'll take care of anybody who touches any metal in the hallway.
(Neil) He'll be knocked cold.
Come on, let's go.
[Door closes]
Vicki, this is Jimmy.
I'll get you out as soon as I can.
[Banging on door]
[Buzzing]
Bruce Wayne.
No one came this way.
Let's split up and head 'em off.
Let me out of here!
Open the door!
[Banging on door]
Batman, they're searching for you.

Excuse me.
Pardon me.
This is what this soldier said to the lady.
- [ Whispering ]
- [ laughing ]
I beg your pardon, miss.
I think you dropped this.
Well! thanks, mister.
- Where do you hail from, stranger?
- Boston.
- That some foreign country?
- I'm beginning to think so.
I want a glass of milk.
Plain.
No rum.
And no comments.
I like milk.
- He bent that dollar just like it was butter!
- I'll be a ring-tailed baboon!
What do they feed the cows in that there Boston? Pig iron?
- Scrap.
- [ laughing ]
Everybody jump!
Kegs McKeever is on a tear.
He's got the toothache again!
Whiskey, you cross-eyed bar slop!
Whiskey for this blazing tooth of mine!
Don't gulp it. Just roll it around in your mouth.
Why you interfering blabbermouth!
I got a notion-- got him, boys?
This is the last time you break the peace. Comanche bill's got a busted jaw.
- You broke up the red stallion too!
- Mike's place is a wreck.
You know I'm not responsible when this tooth is aching.
Go ahead and hang me if you want to.
Leastwise I won't have no more pain.
Who said anything about hanging?
I'm gonna pull that durn tooth of yours.
Ohh!
[ Laughing ]
- I don't see the point of no joke.
- I guess there isn't any.
I can fix that tooth if you let me have a look at it.
- A dentist, huh?
- No! I'm no dentist!
I'm a druggist.
If you'll let me put a little painkiller on it--
- painkiller?
- yes.
Quit sashaying around and fix me up!
Well, sit down.
- Open up.
- [ Groans ]
I said open up.
[ Boat whistle ]
- What was that?
- Partly me and partly the Sacramento boat whistle.
Come on, man, because i gotta catch that boat.
I can't. I'm afraid.
Even looking at it might hurt.
Then I'll have to give you something.
Something that'll really settle your nerves.
Just take a whiff of this, and think of something pleasant.
You mean like bees a-singin' and birds a-buzzin'?
That's right.
Ohh, I hear cowbells!
That'll fix him up.
He'll sleep for a while.
- Did he say he'd sleep for a while?
- Sounded something similar.
[ Snorts ]
- We better make a run for it, youngster.
- Nope, we got time.
The marianne always whistles her head off to get folks out of the saloon.
Make way, folks! Make way.
Thank you, thank you.
Make way for miss Lacy Miller, the sweetest singer in Sacramento.
Make way.
People are staring because they've never seen a bathtub before.
- Silly. ain't worth the look.
- Don't be so common!
[ Man ] make way, folks.
Thank you.
All they need is a brass band.
Take it easy with that tub.
It's real porcelain.
My, oh my!
Ain't the lady gonna look pretty sitting in that.
[ Gunshot ] any more remarks?
- You dang fool, that's brit Dawson.
- Get outta here!
Bring the tub through, boys.
Take it all the way across.
Don't drop it in that mud.
- Lacy, you can't set foot in that.
- Not with my new slippers.
Wait till I tear up a sidewalk.
He knows i hate waiting.
Take this on board, youngster.
All ladies hate waiting, so they shouldn't be made to wait.
- Put me down!
- Nonsense! It's ankle deep!
I'm Lacy Miller.
Nobody ever dared pick me up like this before.
Happy to know you.
My name's Craig, Tom Craig.
Lately of Boston.
The sooner you get back there, the safer, stranger.
I don't know.
I'm beginning to like the west.
That'll teach you to lay hands on the lady i aim to marry!
Oh! in that case, i offer my sincerest apologies.
- Apologies for walloping ya?
- No! For treating your bride-to-be like a package.
What kind of lingo is this?
He's from Boston.
Which means I'm ignorant of the customs here.
In Boston, it's considered good manners to carry a lady...
- Across a muddy street.
- And you had to tear up a sidewalk!
- This ain't Boston!
- Don't let that worry you.
Where's my hat?
- Here you are, mister.
- And here you are, Sonny.
Wait a minute.
I'll bend it for luck.
- [ Boy ] hey, look at what he's doin'!
- That's downright pretty!
- If that don't beat all!
- I've seen everything.
I'll take you to your cabin.
Thank you, sir, for your elegant assistance.
- The pleasure was all mine.
- Cut the palaver.
[ Man ] stand by.
Raise up your gangplank.
[ Chattering ]
You lazy swobs!
Well, here I am.
You sure are. How's your tooth?
Whatever you did to my tooth stopped it achin'.
Whatever I can do for you in return, I'll do.
Wherever you go in this whole world, I'm goin' with ya.
- Sounds like a nice, quiet life.
- But you don't understand.
When I haven't got a toothache,
I'm as gentle as a dove.
But when I got one,
I'm a raging, ferocious, longhaired sea lion a-roarin' for my prey!
A-roarin'?
- A-roarin'!
- in that case, I'll keep my painkiller handy.
Whoa.
Where do we sleep?
Come on.
- I wish brit was more polite.
- Like they are in Boston?
His voice is so loud, and when he talks he sounds like a cowhand.
Who, Boston?
No, brit.
And I never saw him bend a silver dollar like that.
I wouldn't think too much about that stranger.
Brit might not like it.
And if brit don't like a thing, life gets kinda untidy.
- What is it I won't like?
- It's manners to knock on a lady's door.
- I was asking a question.
- Oh, yes, Lacy was pondering about the house you're building.
I said you mightn't like red carpet.
And I said you'd give me anything I wanted.
Of course I would.
Gold carpets if you wanted 'em.
[ Dawson ]
what do you say we don't wait
for the house to be finished?
- Let's get married right away.
- No. You promised to wait until the house was finished, and everything the way I wanted before we tied the knot.
I got you the bathtub, didn't I?
That's nothing!
I want cut-glass chandeliers and gold doorknobs.
- [ Man ] hey, brit!
- Oh.
- I just heard Collin's on board.
- Collin!
Here's where I get you the gold carpets.
Ah! it's a good thing i have quick wits!
Don't worry about brit.
I can twist him right around my little finger.
Uh-huh. but someday he might bite the hand that twists him.
- [ Chuckles ]
- [ chuckles mockingly ]
In here.
You two wait out here.
- Hello, Collin.
- I told you I don't want nothin' to do with ya.
You're a mighty hard man to do business with.
Up in Sacramento, you keep so many men around, there's no privacy.
And you light out for frisco without leaving a word!
We got no business to talk about, and that's final.
Here's $1,000.
And here's a receipt for half interest in your ranch.
I'm buyin' in like I said.
That wouldn't pay for one quarter of the stock and you know it.
I'm a-warnin' ya.
You ain't holding me up...
Like you did Hernandez,
markson and treadwell.
I'm waitin' for you to sign that receipt.
- Get out of my cabin!
- [ Laughs ]
[ Gunshot ]
What was the shot?
- Brit's a little busy in there.
- Oh, brit.
Someone hurt?
Wait. I wouldn't go in there unless you wanna be knocked down again by brit Dawson.
Really?
Where do you think you're going?
- Could I be of any assistance?
- Why?
- I heard the shot and--
- oh, you a sawbones?
No, I'm a pharmacist. Druggist to you.
Oh, a pill peddler! That's rich.
Come on in, have yourself a good time.
Sit down.
- How did this happen?
- The clumsy galoot...
Grabbed his gun by the barrel, struck it against something, and it went off in his hand.
- That's how it happened,
eh, Collin?
- Yeah.
A fellow as careless as that oughtn't to own a gun.
So be more careful in the future, friend.
Is it very bad, doc?
It's only a flesh wound.
Now tell me, how did it really happen?
- You heard Dawson.
- But somehow, i don't quite believe him.
You better.
And not only that, we're gonna have lace curtains on every single window.
And red carpets on every floor.
And two bathrooms!
Including the one
with the tub in it.
Eh, Lacy?
Why, brit, you don't have to tell folks about our plumbing.
You'll have Boston thinking we got no class in Sacramento.
It'll be more dressy when he's joined us.
That is, if you aim to stay.
I aim to.
I'm gonna open a drugstore.
That's just what we need up there to make us amount to something, ain't it?
They'll need it all right, if you continue to be so quick on the draw.
How do you mean?
I don't see how even a clumsy galoot...
Could shoot himself in his own right hand.
- Is that a polite way of calling me a liar?
- He didn't call you anything.
Don't you mix in this.
I asked you a question.
Let's say your version of how it happened...
Shows a great deal of imagination.
- A fancy way of saying you don't believe me, huh?
- Frankly, it is.
Now, brit!
[ Water splashing ]
[ Laughing ]
You can't do this to my friend!
- Oh, no?
- No, you can't-- wait, Boston,
I'm coming with ya!
[ Water splashing ]
Take your choice.
Anyone can have a bath or a drink on me.
Here's my notion.
We don't want that pill peddler in Sacramento.
And if he turns up, anyone who calls himself my friend will run him out of town.
Come, Lacy.
Come on, folks, let's wet our windpipes.
Aah.
Well, where do we go from here, pal?
- Sacramento.
- Sacramento?
- Well, what about it?
- No good, kegs. He won't rent.
Let's sashay along to a friendlier town.
I'm gonna rent a shop in Sacramento if I have to pay somebody into bein' my landlord.
Hey, there's the fellow
Dawson knocked overboard off the marianne.
Yeah? huh! He dried out kinda nice, didn't he?
♪♪ [ Whistling ]
- Good morning.
- Morning, stranger.
Who owns the place next door?
When it comes down to it, me!
I want to rent it.
Opening a chemist shop.
Certainly won't interfere
with a trade like yours.
Your name wouldn't be Craig, would it?
Yes. why?
Nothin'. just good day to you.
Good day!
And shut the door behind ya.
What's the matter with this town?
Why won't anybody rent me a shop?
Word's goin' around.
You won't find nobody in town who'll have any truck with ya.
- So, good day.
- Well, why not?
Dawson. brit Dawson.
- What is he, king around here?
- Just about.
- Now get along quick before somebody sees you!
- All right, grandpa.
Keep your beard on.
Another scared rabbit.
There's just one more place.
Over by the saloon.
This store hunting is sure dry work.
- And me feets are just a-killin' me.
- Go rest 'em at the bar.
Gimme a beer.
Make it long and make it wet.
That's Lacy Miller over there, isn't it? What's she doin' here?
She works here, mister.
This is Dawson's place.
You're gonna take a short journey over water, but you just did that.
- That's not news.
- It's in your fortune.
Here you are next to the king of spades, but that's brit, of course.
- Couldn't you tell me something different?
- All right, here.
Shuffle them over, and cut again.
- And keep your mind on your wish.
- Can't keep my mind off it.
What luck, if any?
- The last empty shack in town belongs to Mr. Dawson's girl.
- Over there.
This saloon belongs to Dawson too.
I think that would be an unhealthy joint.
No! no, not that!
Ohh! gimme a whiskey.
Make it double. Never mind!
There's a new man coming into your life.
- What's he look like?
- Trouble.
How do you do, miss Miller?
I've never seen anything happen so fast.
Well, if it ain't
Mr. Boston.
- Surprised?
- no, I heard you were in town.
- Have you rented your store yet?
- Kinda fancied the one next door.
- Know who it belongs to?
- Mm-hmm.
- You've still got the nerve to ask me to rent to you?
- Doesn't take nerve.
- Doesn't take nerve?
- [ Lacy ] go away, Helga.
I understand. You'd be the last person to want to do anything against Mr. Dawson's wishes.
Oh, no.
I ain't afraid of him.
I don't have to be afraid.
I do as I like around here, Boston.
Would you like me for a tenant?
- Lacy--
- I know what I'm doing.
- What would you sell?
- Everything in the way of medicines.
With no doctor here, it's a real necessity.
Oughta be a gold mine!
You could charge a dollar a pill!
That's not exactly the idea.
- I'd charge a fair price and expect a fair profit.
- Oh.
Does that spoil the plan?
I'll give you half the profits for rent.
- Half?
- mm-hmm.
Oh. say, that would make us partners, wouldn't it?
- Yes!
- [ Helga ] partners?
She'll be sole owner ten minutes after brit finds out about it.
Scared, Boston?
I'll take a chance. Is it a deal?
Sealed.

- Nobody store keeps without brit Dawson's say-so.
- Except me.
- Gonna look real nice, isn't it?
- You think so?
- Yank that sign down.
- [ Kegs ] I wouldn't do that.
- Maybe you'll get the idea if I decorate it with lead!
- That's the way we do it.
[ Gunshot ]
Go play Indian someplace else.
What's going on around here?
Oh, little brother Dawson wants to wreck the shop.
Little brother Dawson had better watch out. I'm partners in this shop.
- You're partners?
- Yes, so you better run along...
- And mind your own business.
- Does brit know about this?
- Why don't you ask him?
- I will!
- What do you think?
- Yes!
It's wonderful. Is this the way it's supposed to look?
The stock isn't here yet, but wait till I get that window fixed with the colored bottles.
It'll be very pretty.
Let's celebrate at the palace with a drink.
Just the thing to wash down those nails I swallowed.
A keg of beer, a keg of nails!

That fella aimin' to read in here?
There's no tellin'.
He sure is a queer fish.
- Who is he, anyway?
- Craig's pharmacy.
The new druggist.
Druggist? remind me to ask him about my rheumatism.
No monkeying with that hand.
Oh, say, Mr. brit, would you buy me a little snort?
Get outta my way, whitey, you drunken buzzard.
- Brit.
- there he is.
Yeah, there's Craig.
But have you seen the sign on his store?
Yes, and I want to know how he and it got there after my orders.
- Ask Lacy. She told me personal.
- Lacy?
- They're partners in the store.
- You know better than to lie to me, Joe.
Cut my throat if it ain't the truth. Just ask her.
- I don't understand.

- I ain't contradicting no one.
What makes you so good tempered?
What is this I hear about you being partners in that drugstore?
- Oh, that!
- Well? Are you or aren't you?
You don't have to shout.
Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I go in business if I feel like it?
Business!
Now, brit, you don't have to be like that.
I had the shack doing nothing,
and I had the chance to make
a little money out of it.
Wish I could believe this was on the level.
Maybe you will when I tell you that I get half the profits.
- Huh?
- being the only drugstore, there'll be plenty.
We can charge them a dollar a pill!
Then you're not just doing this for his benefit.
[ Laughing ]
Since when did I do anything for anybody's benefit but my own?
[ Both laughing ]
That's right.
For a minute, I was forgettin'.
No, brit, I've gotta change for the next song.
You better run along.
All right. But remember, if I catch Boston so much as givin' you the eye,
I'll put a slug in him.
- More beer?
- No, thanks.
- Good evening, Boston.
- Oh, hello. How are you?
You don't act like you recollect I had you thrown overboard.
Yes, I remember all right.
How have you been since?
- How have I been?
- Yes. You oughtn't to give way to the outbursts of temper.
It's bad for you.
Accelerates the pulse,
overworks the heart.
Gives you indigestion.
You're not sore at what happened?
Why should I be? You didn't
 really interfere with my plans.
I'm in Sacramento, and opening my drugstore.
Here you are.
Mr. Craig, could you recommend some rubbing oil for tomkins's shoulder?
I think so.
Put a teaspoon of this in a pint of boiling water and apply it.
Don't rub it in or you'll take the skin off him.
- Sometimes I've wanted to do just that.
- Not with anything from my shop.
Your tonics may be tonics, but i can't get Archie to take this, so I'll take my money back.
- What's the matter with it, Archie?
- Don't like it.
That's too bad.
I was raised on that fine old remedy.
It's a great muscle builder too.
- Gee, lookit!
- For land sakes!
- We'll take it back, ma.
- Get me one, ma. Get two!
- Two?
- yeah, I got a date to fight Archie.
[ Laughing ]
- Well, what are you doing out here that's so useful?
- Just admiring your washing.
You get shirts nice and clean.
I don't know how i ever got along without you.
- That's the last washing I'm doing for you.
- How's that?
A single girl can't do for a fellow regular without people talkin'.
- I got my good name to consider.
- Talking? Saying what?
Nothin', just askin' if you and I are aimin' to get hitched.
You better get outta here quick and permanent.
I see.
Well, I think I'll get in the laundry first.
- What are you doing with my gun?
- I used to be a pretty shot. Excuse me.
[ Gunshots ]
Thank you.
Any questions?
Helga, be mine!
Why, kegsie, this is such a surprise!
- Now that you've seen the whole town, Ellen--
- what do you think?
Haven't seen a man
I'd sit at the same dinner table with.
- Naturally the settlers are rather crude, but--
- good heavens, who's that?
A singer from the dance hall.
Looks like she just escaped from a birdcage.
And over there is the new drugstore.
And is that, by any chance, the new druggist?
- I'm sure I hope you'll make a success of it.
- Thank you, Mrs.--
- Coggins, is the name.
- Coggins.
That's a downright shame to saddle a pretty girl with a name like that.
- Somebody oughta change it for her.
- Coggins is my name, young man.
Yes. huh? Oh! Sorry.
Is this the new drugstore everybody in town's talkin' about?
Hey, look out!
Look out!
What are you tryin' to do?
Run me down?
- Think she owns the street!
- Quiet, you're scaring the horse.
I feel faint.
Ellen!
She's fainted!
Ellen handles horses like a man.
She's never afraid!
Yes, it's very odd.
What can we do?
Go in the back room and get some water. Hold her.
I'm all right. It must've been a touch of the sun.
There's not enough sun out to warm a rattlesnake.
And that's how i bid good-bye to San Francisco.
So you didn't like my home town.
I didn't see the best part of it until you came to Sacramento.
- Ooh, fried chicken!
- Men always like fried chicken, don't they?
It's all I need to make life perfect and complete.
That is, practically all.
- Certainly is a beautiful view, isn't it?
- It certainly is.
Hey, Boston, you're wanted at the store.
The man's here from San Francisco with the medical supplies.
- Why does Tom have to go?
- He won't leave them unless he checks the list.
He would pick my one day off.
It's a good thing you didn't bring anything hot.
It might get cold.

Senor Hernandez, get me a glass of punch, por favor.
For me too, Jose.
I'm sure he'll propose to her tonight.
But Ellen won't accept.
She doesn't love him.
Now what are you two saying about me?
We were talking about you and Mr. Craig.
- Has he proposed yet?
- No, but he will before the evening's over.
He's very much in love with you.
He will be terribly sad when you say no.
- Who's saying no?
- But you don't love him.
What if I don't?
You girls are so old-fashioned.
He's good-looking, and a gentleman.
With my father's backing, i can make him a big man in San Francisco.
Is the young lady present
who promised me this dance?
Why I'd forgotten all about you.
Pardon.
Ellen?
I, uh-- this is the first time--
- are you in the mood for a very important question?
- I guess I'm in the mood.
Then I'm gonna ask you right here and now if--
Tom, will you please go in the house and get my fan?
- Before I ask you the question?
- Yes, please.
It's on the chest in the hall.
Well, all right.
- Oh, hello.
- What is it this time?
- I'm looking for Tom Craig.
- With some other trumped-up call to the drugstore?
- You don't fool me one bit.
- Funny. I see through you too.
Throwing yourself at his head.
Trailing him like a bloodhound.
Now even trying to poke your nose in here. Haven't you any pride?
No. but at least I never pulled a fake faint on him.
Why you cheap painted hussy!
Well, thank goodness I am not lady enough to hit anybody.
Here's your fan.
Oh, hello, Lacy.
Who wants to see me now?
Old man Higgins is very sick.
His boy's at the drugstore and won't leave until you get there.
I guess I'd better go.
Of course you must go!
I hope it isn't serious.
Don't forget.
I'll be at the dock to see you off, and ask that question.
Good-bye till then.
Good night, miss Miller.
Night.
She has a remarkably sweet disposition.
Yes, I've never met anything quite like it.
Lacy, wait a minute. I wanna--
I told you about Higgins, and that's all I came for.
Here you are, Sonny.
The directions are on the label.
If he doesn't feel better in the morning, let me know.
Boston! Boston!
Hey, what's wrong now?
It's the Dawsons. They're on a land-grabbing tear.
The Peterson's house is burning, and the libberts were driv' out.
And with only with what they stood up in.
Doesn't anybody fight back around here?
What's one man agin that whole gang?
Can't we get 'em together?
Shake a leg, kid. They were on their way to your house.
My pa's not able to lift a hand.
We'll get you some help.
Let's round up some neighbors and give the Dawsons a reception.
- Come on, kegs. Are you with us?
- You're darn tootin'!
Tomkins! tomkins!
- Here, here, here!
What in tarnation--
- the Dawsons are ridin'.
We're gonna try to stop 'em at the Higgins place.
Will you come along?
- Soon as I get my pants on.
- Good.
- Hey, bates! Carlin.
- Who's there?
What's the matter?
Ride over to the Higgins's.
We're gettin' up a hot reception for the Dawsons.
It's about time! I'll be right along.
Shake a leg, and don't lose any time doin' it!
I'll be there!
- Meet ya at the Higgins place.
- Right.
- Hide the horses around back of the house.
- All right.
- Hello, Archie. Hello, Mrs. Higgins.
- Hello, Mr. bates.
- How are you, boy?
- Not so good.
Sure glad you got here. You can help us get pa into the wagon.
He hadn't oughta leave the house.
Let's take him up in the loft.
- Up the ladder?
- Sure! Take the younguns, and go up ahead.
- Step smart, children.
We'll get him up.
- Mister, give me a hand.
Hurry up, ma.
Fine time for me to be laid up.
That's all right.
Go on, Archie.
- Hey, they're here.
- I can hear 'em.
Where in tarnation is Craig and the rest of them?
We're no match for the gang!
[ Pounding on door ]
- Higgins, open up!
- What are we gonna do?
Stall 'em someway.
[ Meows ]
[ Pounding on door continues ]
- Get in there.
- What?
- You're gonna have a baby.
- Baby?
Ooh, get out!
I'll have it.
- And I ain't even married.
- Shh!
Higgins!
[ pounding on door ]
What are you doin' here?
- I might ask you the same question.
- I'm looking for Higgins.
- He ain't here.
- Where'd he go this time of night?
Look who just rode up.
Packin' a gun too.
- Isn't that the custom in this country?
- Quite a gathering here tonight.
- I heard Mr. Higgins was ill.
- Not mister!
- The missus.
- The missus?
- Yes. mister went up the river to get a doctor.
- Oh!
Don't get too close.
It might be catching.
Don't be afraid
of catching that, Dawson.
She's having a baby.
Lie still, Mrs. Higgins.
I'll heat some rocks to put at your feet.
- She been suffering much?
- Not yet.
But you can never tell about a woman like Mrs. Higgins.
- She'd die before she'd even let out a whimper.
- Yes, yes.
How insignificant is man when confronted with the divine mystery of birth, and the courage of a woman like that.
I don't suppose that means anything to you!
Nobody can say brit Dawson don't respect motherhood.
Don't worry, ma'am, we'll wait for your ol' man outside.
Aa-choo!
I'll show you how I respect a mother!
Why you fast-talkin', son of a coyote!
We're in trouble. There's a crowd comin' over the hill.
Come on!
Hightail it outta here!
[ Laughing ] tell 'em again how you stalled 'em, kegs.
Bates told Dawson i was gonna have a baby.
Hello, mama!
I bet brit and Joe are boilin' mad by now.
Boilin' at Craig, anyhow.
He gets all the credit
for them being driv' off.
About time they got a dose of their medicine.
The prescription's simple.
You take a bunch of angry men defending their homes, mix well and serve hot.
- To the Dawsons.
- Let's drink to the cure of the Dawson disease.
And let's always make it
Craig's prescription!
Something's wrong.
Brit and Joe are stalking behind the drugstore, and they ain't looking for pills.
I'll run over. Keep Boston here even if you gotta hogtie him.
- They're still inside whoopin' it up.
- He's gotta come out sometime.
Hello, Lacy. Takin' the air kinda late, ain't ya?
- Who are you and Joe waiting for?
- Me and Joe?
Taking the air ourselves.
With your gun drawn so you don't feel chilly?
We're waiting for your friend Craig.
He interfered with business we had at the Higgins place, but his interfering days are over.
- He was there because the old man was sick.
- It's no go.
He was there, and he made fools out of us.
So you better mooch out of the way of any shooting.
All right. But I may as well warn you.
If you harm him in any way, you're out of my life for good.
Seems to me you're mighty upset about your business partner.
She's stuck on him, that's why.
You keep out of this. Well, Lacy?
Sure, I'm upset. I kinda feel responsible for him.
If I hadn't wanted to make money out of the drugstore, he wouldn't be here.
And if you lay a hand on him, we're through.
All right, Lacy. You win.
You know I wouldn't do anything to lose you.
Sweet singin' coyotes!
Why, brit, you're a real gentleman.
That being the case, allow me the honor to escort you back to the palace...
Stylish, like they do in Boston.
Good night, madam. Sweet dreams.
- How's that for manners?
- Fine, brit, and thanks.
What's your hurry?
Never thought you'd be henpecked into being a softy.
- Can't you see she's lyin', trying to save Craig's hide?
- Of course she's lying.
She means that about not marrying me if anything happens to him.
So this has to be done some way she doesn't know i have a hand in it.
Let me do it. It'd be a pleasure.
No, she'd lay it to me just the same. This is gonna be a smart one.
Like the time we got the Johnsons for stealing their own cattle.
Say, there's a tonic he's been pouring down everybody.
Sure. that whole shebang that gave us the shootin' party take it.
That's right. You wait here.
I got a notion to take a swig of this, I'm so weak-like.
You're strong enough for me, kegsie-wegsie.
Plenty strong.
When I get a toothache,
I'm too strong for any sheriff's posse too.
Which reminds me, Helga.
I ain't fit to marry no woman, no matter how good a shot she is.
If you have a reason, it better be good.
- Well... it's this tooth.
- Hmm.
When I get a toothache,
I'm a raging bull.
I shoot up joints. I throw bartenders out of windows.
I slap widows. I kick babies.
- I'm a terror.
- I'll bet.
I'm liable to throw you off a roof.
I'm liable to cut
your head off with an ax.
So you see, I just can't let you marry me, Helga.
Oh, you can't?
Well, it's on account of my tooth.
- You're too fine a woman for such a fate.
- Mmm.
Just the mention of it starts it aching... a mite.
If that's the case, you better go in the back room and have a nap.
- I'll finish everything out here.
- That's fine of you to take it that way.
Oh, think nothing of it.
[ Boat whistle blowing ]
Ellen!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Wait a minute!
Don't go on board.
Hello, everybody. Have an apple?
If you'll excuse me,
I'd like to speak to Ellen.
Senor, it is not proper without a chaperone.
Then we'll make it a family session.
By now, you know that I love you, and I want to marry you.
- Why, Tom!
- Don't say this is so sudden.
You've seen this coming for a long time.
It is correct only to make the proposal to the parent.
When she produces a parent,
I'll gladly propose to him.
But right now, what do you say?
I'll ask father as soon
as I get to San Francisco.
While we're waiting for his consent, why don't you say yes, anyway?
Yes, anyway.
[ Boat whistle blows ] senor.
This is highly irregular!
[ Man ] all aboard
for San Francisco.
- Ellen, hurry. You're going to miss your boat.
- Los americanos.
Pretty, isn't it?
Oh, hello.
- I saw you from the road.
- That's fine.
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.
- What about?
- A man in Boston.
- Oh.
- he was my roommate in school.
Skinny galoot.
Always talkin' about fate.
You know, the thing that makes you suddenly decide...
Not to take a certain train but to take another one, and the one you missed is wrecked.
Or maybe the one you took is wrecked, and you'd have been safe on the other one.
- Scary, isn't it, when you get to thinking about it?
- Yep.
Particularly when you think of how little things can change your whole life.
I know what you mean.
You go along following a sort of--
- pattern?
- yes. Then suddenly something happens...
That doesn't seem to amount to anything at the time.
No. but when you look back, you can trace it and say...
- The change began right then.
- That's it.
Boston, are you trying to make up your mind about something?
Oh, no. I'm just thanking my lucky stars I did what I did six months ago.
The day before I left Boston,
a man offered to set me up
in business on a big scale.
Common sense told me i should take it.
But something else told me to go on to California like I'd planned.
I didn't even take a day to think it over. I just left, and traveled 3,000 miles, and arrived just in time to catch a boat you were on.
If I'd have started a day
sooner or a day later,
I might've missed you and the girl I'm gonna marry.
And the strangest part
of it is...
That I didn't settle
in San Francisco
where she lives,
but I picked Sacramento
where she came on a visit.
[ Laughs ] that's one for Charlie's books.
Who's Charlie?
The man in Boston.
So it was serious with you and her.
Plenty serious.
Good luck, Boston.
- What do you want, whitey?
- I want a drink.
We don't sell liquor here.
Roll into the palace.
They just rolled me out of there.
There's no more credit.
What's in them bottles?
Ain't that liquor?
That's tonic waitin' to be delivered to respectable folk.
Get yourself out of here.
- Go on. Scat. Git!
- I'm a-goin'.
[ Door shuts ] the idea!
[ Snoring ]
[ Kegs yelling ]
Ooh, my tooth!
That's a dirty trick, creeping up on an innocent man in his sleep.
March. mustn't keep the preacher waiting.
Preacher? he won't be in now.
- Come back here!
- Yes, dear.
The preacher is in and your tooth is out.
- So pick up those feet or my handbag might go off.
- Yes, honey.
That's better. Howdy.
Well, here's to ya, Ezra.
Wanna stop in at the store?
No, thanks. You can set me down at the palace.
- [ Crowd shouting ]
- Tom, look!
What's happened? What's the crowd for?
[ Excited chattering ]
- Here he comes now!
- There he is!
- What's wrong here?
- Plenty.
- You've got a mite of explaining to do.
- What sort of explaining?
How come whitey's layin' dead in his store?
- With a bottle of Craig's mixture by him empty.
- That's right!
Don't be too long explainin' or--
[ chattering ]
- What's goin' on here?
- Whitey's been murdered.
- By poison.
- Poison?
- He's dead.
- Let's find out.
- He's dead, all right.
- By what means, druggist?
- Poison.
- [ crowd gasps ]
Must've been enough laudanum in that bottle to kill a mule.
- How'd it get there?
- I don't know.
- Let me through. Let me pass.
- Quit shoving.
This is a free show for all of us, miss Lacy.
Well, Craig?
- They've been tampered with, every one of them.
- Can you explain how?
Someone poured laudanum in this bottle I mix the prescription in.
- You keep laudanum in this shop?
- Of course. This is a drugstore.
- Just a minute. Mr. Craig has been a friend to everyone.
- Mind your own business, Eli.
[ Men shouting ]
[ Knocks on table ] wait.
- Proceed, bates.
- You use it to mix medicine for folks?
Yes, but only a few drops at a time.
Your hand slipped this time, druggist.
I don't say this man's done it intentional, but he made a mistake that could've killed half of this town.
- It's happened. Look at that crowd.
- Sizeable and sore.
[ Excited chattering ]
- What's going on?
- They're trying the druggist for poisoning whitey.
- Come on, let's get inside.
- No. Better not mix in.
[ Man ] it might've been my kid.
Sounds like they'll be bringin' him out in a minute.
[ Shouting ]
- Get a rope!
- Get that buggy down by the big tree.
- You're not gonna use my rig for any lynching.
- Use Jim's buckboard.
[ Excited chattering ]
Let me through!
Tom!
- Tom! Tom!
- Put him up there.
Put him on the wagon.
There she is, fightin' like a wildcat to save that pill peddler.
- No fightin' will save him now.
- Get that rope around him.
Gold! gold!
- Gold!
- where'd you find it?
- Let me see it.
[ Excited chattering ]
Gold! look at it.
They're picking it up in chunks.
- What are you waitin' for?
- Huh? I'm your friend.
So you're gonna stand around here and watch me hang...
When you could be out grabbing yourself a rich claim?
- [ Shouting ]
- forget friendship.
That fella's talkin' about gold.
Gold that you can buy
anything in the world with.
Kegsie, gold!
Gold lying on the ground,
waitin' for you to pick it up.
Now, get out of here...
- Before everybody in California beats you to it.
- Gold! Everybody, gold!
I'm gonna be the first one to stake a claim!
I'm gonna stake a claim right away. Follow me.
Come on.
Let's get gold! Come on.
- Gold!
- [ excited chattering ]
Gold at sutter's mill!
- That fellow has the devil's own luck.
- Yeah, sure.
What are we hangin' around for?
Let's get in on that gold rap.
Come on. He'll keep.
You're right.
I can come back and get him.
With the gold mine for Lacy to dry her eyes on, she won't feel so bad.
At sutter's mill there's gold!
Gold at sutter's mill!
Boy, that's as near to a funeral as I ever wanna get!
If you hadn't pulled my tooth, I could've gotten mad enough to handle that crowd.
- What are you doin'?
- Oh, we're married.
Yeah, we are.
- Huh! ain't he wonderful?
- [ Laughing ]
That's my man.
Here you are! Get your utensils for pannin' gold!
Pots and pans, all prices, all sizes.
- That one'll cost you two bags of gold dust.
- That's outrageous.
Cheapest in Sacramento.
There's a run on pans same as there is on gold.
Come on, folks, get your pans.
What luck did you have with the bighorn that calls himself our town marshal?
He refused to open the case.
So that's what he calls brinin' in law and order?
- Did you come right out and accuse Dawson?
- Certainly.
But all bighorn would say is,
"i ain't interested in your personal feuds."
Well, I guess that closes up our business permanent, huh?
Brit isn't coming back and holler to this town that Craig's innocent.
No, but he's comin' back, all right,
'cause I'm still walking around.
But as far as this store goes, we might as well admit it.
We're whipped.
Write "closed" on the window.
- Cologne soap?
- We might as well finish in style.
Clem, you and pike take the bags of dust to the palace safe.
Chick and I are gonna pay a call on the pill peddler.
Too bad Joe ain't here to see the fun.
He's having fun seein' folks don't cut in on our claim.
Closed, huh? Had to skip town.
Ain't that a pity?
Too bad you can't say good-bye personal.
Let's make the closing official.
[ Gunshots, glass shattering ]
It's our friend Dawson.
- Hello, Lacy.
- Brit!
Bust my britches, but you're prettier than ever.
Glad to see me?
- Sure, but you don't have to squeeze the life out of me.
- [ Chuckles ]
- You'll be a sight gladder when you've seen what I brought ya.
- [ Gasps ]
Jumpin' coyotes! Where did you get such large nuggets?
From the claim up at bogus thunder.
Come on, drinks on the house.
- Yes, sir.
- For everybody.
For you and me, too, honey, to celebrate the pill peddler's departure.
I think you're a bit previous, brit.
[ Brit ] well, well. Craig.
I figured you were halfway to
Boston by now with your tail between your legs.
You figured a lot of things wrong, Dawson.
[ Shouting ]
[ Gunshot ]
Brit, stop it! Stop it, someone!
Are you ready to talk, Dawson?
You're gonna tell these people who doctored the medicine that killed poor whitey.
What's going on? Break it up.
Get him off of there.
- Don't pay any attention to him. He's crazy.
- This man committed murder.
I'm not concerned with any arguments that happened before I took over the law here.
I rule this fight broke up permanent, and I'll slam both of you in the calaboose...
- If you don't keep away from each other.
- Not till I make him talk.
Grab him, deputies, grab him!
For assault, battery, ignoring, disregardin' the law...
And pushin' a United States marshal around, 60 days!
- Now, march!
- [ Deputy ] Come on.
What did you have to call the marshal for?
- Tom had brit ready to sing his song.
- Yeah.
Come on, set up those drinks I was orderin' before this squall blew up.
Step up, folks, and wet your windpipes.
Ahh! what's the matter, Lacy?
Ain't you thirsty?
- [ Laughing ]
- you wanna tell me your joke?
What's the idea of throwing this back at me?
I don't want it or anything else from you from now on.
Because I had a fight with your pill peddler?
No. something a little more important than that.
Where do you think you're going?
Anywhere from here.
I'm not particular.
Lacy, I gotta know the reason for this.
The reason is the way whitey died.
He died because your high-snootin' friend from Boston doesn't know his business.
No, but up to now i must admit you had me fooled.
I might've known you were behind this lynching.
You were the only person in town who had anything against him.
- Did he teach you to say this?
- No, he didn't say a word.
He's much too decent.
So let go of my arm.
I want to finish packing.
Listen, Lacy, I don't admit monkeying with anything.
What I can't get is why you're takin' on like this.
I've killed men before!
Yeah, but shootin' out in the open has something square and fair about it.
Killing with poison is sneaky and lowdown.
Look here, Lacy.
What's come over you?
I tell you, I had nothing to do with it.
Let's forget it and start over again.
I struck it awful rich. I can give you those gold doorknobs you were talking about.
Let me go. If you kept me here till doomsday, it wouldn't make any difference.
Go to your quack pill peddler.
He can have you, and welcome!
This scheme of going to the camps is wrong, and I won't have no part of it!
Rest your tonsils.
We're a-goin', and you're comin'.
- Take this.
- Why don't you use some tact?
- Let her go in there and say good-bye.
- What-- maybe you're right, but it ain't gonna do any good as far as she's concerned.
He's always acted more like a hitchin' post than a two-legged man.
- [ Squawking ]
- ah, shut up.
Hello, there, Boston.
Why, Lacy, don't you look grand.
It's just a little traveling outfit Helga and I ran up.
- You're going someplace?
- To the gold mines with the rest of the world.
Thought I'd say good-bye.
- You're gonna dig gold?
- Sure am.
The easy way.
Out of miners' pockets.
Figured they needed entertainment now.
Can't sit in the back
of an empty drugstore
for the rest of my life.
I'm sorry our partnership was such a failure.
Oh, that. I don't regret any of it.
That a letter from San Francisco?
Oh, yes. I'll be leaving soon too.
Ellen's coming up, and
we're going back together.
Oh.
- Good luck, Boston.
- You too, Lacy.
If you ever get to San Francisco-- oh, yes.
Drop in and have dinner with you and the wife.
No, thanks. I'm just hoping that I never see you again.
- Why?
- don't you know?
You're makin' me shove off, leaving Boston with no one to look after him.
He'll do fine once he's hitched to miss snippety-puss up to frisco.
Listen, you two.
I don't want to hear any more talk about him.
I want to forget I ever set eyes on him. I don't want to hear his name mentioned again.
- Boston. [ squawks ]
- Shut up!
Quiet. shh.
- Hey, partner.
- What do you want, lady?
- How big a camp is this?
- Was 30 shacks or so till folks started to sicken.
You all look puny, as if you could do with a good meal and some sleep.
Giddyap! they need entertainment like a dead horse needs flies.
- What's the name of this camp?
- Brandy gulch.
Did you pass a doctor on the trail up?
- A short, stubby fellow with gray hair?
- No. Is anybody sick?
Anybody sick?
[ Laughs ]
Half the camp's down with the fever.
Hello, there!
- Are you from Sacramento?
- Why, yes.
I'm Dr. clagham. Did you bring those medical supplies?
- What supplies?
- What supplies?
Howlin' coyotes!
Don't they know we've got an epidemic on our hands?
- Epidemic?
- yes. Typhoid fever.
And we got no drugs to treat it.
We got no food or comforts.
In every camp for miles around men are dying like flies.
Doctor, you gotta save Carson.
You can't leave him like this, burning and raving with fever.
You gotta do something!
Mrs. Carson, what can I do?
- I'm helpless.
- Why, doc?
Isn't there something
we can do to help?
What do you think you could do here?
We got enough trouble without women of your kind.
Look, miss Carson.
- Don't take on like that.
Maybe Helga and I can help.
- Sure we'll help.
- Will you show us where we could shake down, please?
- All right.
- I take it real kind of you, Lacy.
- Thanks, Mrs. Carson.
I don't suppose...
Any of those fellows in Sacramento give a hang...
About these poor devils dyin' up here.
I know someone.
Tom Craig, a druggist.
Get a fast horse, ride like blazes and bring him back here.
- Where'll I get a horse?
- Use my horse. He's a whizzer.
Come on, let's go!
Tell him we need enough for an army!
Hurry up, Tom.
If I'd known all this was going on, I wouldn't have come to make the trip back with you.
You wouldn't want me to show my appreciation by leaving my stock in trade behind.
Boston, I'm so glad i caught you. They sent me.
Corral all the medicine you got, everything, and hurry up!
- What are you talking about?
- They want him up at the camps.
- There's fever, nothing to fight it with.
- Nothing to fight it with?
- There's only one doc, and he's working like mad.
- That's terrible.
- Are there many cases?
- All the camps have got it.
It's so bad at bear claw...
- That Lacy and Helga pitched in as nurses.
- Oh, that woman.
Come on, Ellen.
I don't think Lacy started an epidemic...
Just to see me.
She did send you, didn't she?
I suppose you could say she had a hand in it.
- It looks like I'll have to go.
- Why?
Why should you risk your life for a lot of riffraff?
They're people.
They need help.
Oh, you and your high ideals.
Where did they ever get you?
They're the very same people that turned against you.
They even tried to hang you.
- That doesn't enter into it.
- If it doesn't, it should.
Let's just forget the whole idea, Boston.
Don't go, kegs. Ellen--
I'm going back to San Francisco.
Are you coming with me?
I'm going to the gold camps first.
Then don't bother to come after me, if and when you come back.
[ Whistles ]
I saw the same look in a rattlesnake's eye once...
When I accidentally stomped on it.
Let's see how we're fixed for medicine.
What you got is a drop in the bucket. Doc says he wants enough for an army.
Then we'll get enough, and an army to take it.
Thanks for your cooperation, marshal.
It's easy to get the medicine, but I don't see how you're gonna get the people to walk into it.
You have the supplies ready,
I'll round up the people.
They wouldn't even stop to listen to Gabriel's horn, let alone you.
They'll have to... sometime.
[ Bell clanging ]
- Here, kegs. Keep that up.
- Huh? Oh.
[ Clanging continues ]
[ Clanging continues ]
Hold it, everybody!
- Quiet down! Don't panic.
- [ Excited chattering ]
I got a message for you.
I don't know whether to appeal to your good sense or your courage...
Because I don't know how much of either you have.
- What's that?
- What's he getting at?
I do know you're facing something that's gonna call for both:
Good sense and courage.
You think you're running away from the fever. Well, you aren't.
Some of you already have it, and
you're carrying it to others...
- Same as it was carried to you.
- Ain't that too bad!
What's he trying to say?
We ought to stay here and die like flies?
- [ Crowd mumbling ]
- no!
Word came from San Francisco that they're sending all the medical help we'll need.
They're also sending enough supplies and medicines for the gold camps.
And it's up to us
to get them there.
It's gonna take every wagon,
horse and able-bodied man
we have to get 'em through.
- Are you out of your head?
- You think we're crazy?
You askin' us to go into that death trap?
I'm not asking anything.
I'm telling you how things stand, then it's up to you.
You can stampede out of here like cattle and spread this fever...
Into every town in
California if you want to.
Or you can stay here
and get help if you're sick...
And give help
if you're not.
It's in your hands, so make up your minds.
Pioneers!
I've got two wagons
I'll donate. Somebody can drive the other one.
I'll drive the other one.
- I'll go with him. I ain't got no womenfolk to worry about.
- Me, neither.
I ain't seen a man yet can tell me I'm afraid and prove it.
- Me, neither.
- I reckon I'll go along.
[ Chattering ]
Dang if I don't think
I'm goin' with 'em.
I should've shot him off the wagon while I had the chance.
- I'm glad you didn't.
- When did you get religion?
- We're gonna need Craig around for a while.
- What for?
Get the wagon train started for the camp.
- Since when did you mind people dying?
- Use your head.
Those folks in the camps are rolling in gold.
If we corner all the medicine, we can swap it for every nugget they've dug in six months.
How do you figure to grab the wagons?
They have to go through digger pass. Don't they?
We'll be there waitin' for them.
I gotta hand it to you for being the meanest coyote this side of the rockies.
Thanks.
But remember, I claim the pleasure of pickin' off Craig personal.
Let's round up the rest of the gang.
Digger pass is half a day's ride.
Good. we ought to be at bear claw by nightfall.
Whip it up, boys.
We're on our last lap!
Come on, boys!
Once we're through the pass, the going's easy.
Them wagons are sure takin' a long time.
Clem, any sign of those wagons yet?
Not a sign of nothing expect pike.
Well, pike, my boy?
How are things at bear claw?
Are the folks ready to swap all their dust for medicine?
- It's awful bad.
- Fever's got most everybody down.
- Lacy's up there.
- Lacy?
Yeah. she and Helga's
got their hands full
taking care of sick folks.
- Lacy's up at bear claw.
- What of it?
She might get the fever.
Maybe she's got it already.
I've got to get to her.
- We've got a date with the wagon train.
- I've got to get Lacy out.
- We get the wagons first.
- You can take care of the wagons by yourself.
I ain't takin' those wagons alone while you go chasing around after Lacy.
Have you forgotten she threw you over for the first soft- talkin' dude that came along?
Why don't you get smart? She never had any use for you anyway.
Now maybe you'll stop yapping.
I'm gonna get Lacy and you're gonna take care of those wagons.
[ Gunshot ]
The wagons are coming!
From now on I'm giving the orders here.
When this job is finished, each man gets his equal share of the dust.
Any arguments? Then get on your horses and follow me.
[ Gunshots ]
We haven't got a chance here!
Make a run for it!
Let's go, men!
These teams can't keep up this pace. Pull over into that draw.
[ Gunshots continue ]
[ Gunshots continue ]
Craig, I want those wagons!
- Come and get 'em!
- It sounds like the Dawsons.
[ Gunshot ] it is the Dawsons.
Got 'im.
You have enough yet, Craig?
[ Gunshots continue ]
Our only chance is to get 'em out of those rocks.
Yes, if you want any drivers left.
- I guess I better go up there and have a chat with him.
- They'll fill you full of lead.
Hold your fire, Dawson!
- Boston, you're crazy!
- Let go of me.
That moss head.
What a target for a bull's-eye-- hold it. We need him to order the train to surrender.
I'm comin' to talk to you.
Chuck your gun away and come on up!
[ Chuckling ] keep him covered.
You walked right into it, eh, Craig?
- I have a proposition.
- We make the proposition.
You order that wagon train to surrender, or we shut your mouth up permanent.
- You've got five minutes to make up your mind.
- I can't understand you at all.
Most of you need what's in that wagon train as much as the people in the gold camps.
- Sure we do, to swap for the gold they got.
- Oh, so that's your plan.
From the looks of you, most of you won't get that far.
- Funny, you giving me five minutes.
- What kind of talk is this?
I know the signs of the fever.
Look at that man's hand shake.
Look at his eyes.
You fellas have been drinking that river water at the claim, haven't you?
That's where the fever comes from.
Out of all the people in the camps, what makes you think you'd escape it?
It isn't exactly a pleasant way
to die, burning with fever, all twisted up in agony and fighting for breath.
Frankly, I don't like the look of any of you.
Especially you, Dawson.
So if you're smart,
you'll call this gunfight off...
And let me try and save you with the stuff in the wagon train, if it's not too late.
We'll get all the medicine we want. Rush the wagons!
Talk yourself out of this one, Craig.
[ Gunshots ]
Joe had it comin' to him.
Get the wagons to bear claw.
[ Gunshots ]
Up the river to red dog.
You go on up to gospel creek.
Up the river to red dog.
Drive on up the river.
Am I glad to see you.
Besides drugs, did you bring food, blankets?
We brought everything.
Unload the wagons, men!
First two wagons go on
to shinbone creek!
Doc, there's a badly wounded man
in the first wagon.
Will you take a look at him?
- [ Doc ] sure.
- Tom!
Tom! thank heaven you're here.
Why, Lacy, you look so different.
Why, yes. These are my working clothes from now on.
I hope sending for you didn't get you into any trouble.
One the contrary.
It got me out of it.
Oh, brit Dawson was badly wounded.
- Brit?
- he wants to see you.
[ Groans ]
No, it's no good, doc.
I got it bad... and final.
Where's Lacy?
I lied to you.
I could've had you for a nurse.
Hold your hand.
Now I haven't got the strength.
Nobody go.
I got somethin' to say before witnesses.
The medicine that killed whitey?
I doctored it.
Boston is no way to blame.
Thanks, brit.
The house...
With the gold doorknobs?
If you want 'em--
♪ there's gold in the valley there's gold in the hills ♪
♪ there's gold in the river and gold in the rill ♪
♪ go empty your cabins and empty your mills ♪

[ Gunshots ]
What's the shootin' for, partner?
That's my wife taking down the washing.
[ Gunshots ] oh! Oh-- okay, coming, dear. Coming, dear.
I'm not gonna do all that washing over again!
McKeever, pick it up!
- Oh.

But gentlemen...I know nothing about this article being printed...
I was out of town.
The let me read what is printed here in your paper.
If Japan wants to control China...
...we must first crush the United States...
...just as in the past we had to fight in the Russo-Japanese War.
Gentlemen, you know the Chronicle has supported the government for 25 years.
Every government.
This insult to Baron Tanaka and the Japanese people...
...has caused great disturbance.
You must know the penalty for disregarding censorship.
If my managing editor has violated any of the regulations...
...I'll fire him!
Nick!
Nick Condon!
Somebody dig up Nick Condon!
He's out...something important.
Said he wasn't to be disturbed.
I don't care if he's interviewing the emperor...
Get him here right away!
- Get him on the phone, Kinshan.
- OK, Mr Sprague.
But he's not going to like it.
Get him anyway.
Hello, Oshima!
What's on your mind?
There is a matter to discuss...
If you please.
Shoot!
It is an official matter of great importance.
Great!...Come on in...
We'll talk it over.
- Nick...will you please get...
- Oh...alright...alright!
Hand me that towel, will you.
Lies! Lies!
It is all one big lie!
Every word is untrue.
Now, just a minute...
You must disclose source of your information.
Police must know name of this traitor.
Alright...that's fair enough...
You have a right to know.
The name of the traitor is the American press.
That article appeared in 3 New York newspapers.
But I cannot believe it!
Alright...check with your consul in New York.
Very unfortunate...when an
American newspaper prints slander...
Oh, I agree...I agree!
If there's anything I hate...
...it's to give anyone a poor impression of Japanese friendship.
Ah...thank you!
Thank you.
You can't do this to me, Nick.
My blood pressure won't stand it.
Supposing they shut me down?
When I came here 2 years ago and took over this rag...
It was on one condition...
And I run it!
I know Nick...but you can't...
Your circulation has doubled.
Advertising has gone up 500%...
And you're making more money than you ever made in your life.
You're not doing so badly yourself.
You're making 5 times the money you made in Shanghai.
Tired of the deal?
Don't think I don't appreciate what you did for The Chronicle.
But printing things like that...
That's what newspapers are for...
That's what people buy.
Not just Japanese propaganda handouts.
This was just a rumor!
And thousands of American businessmen have a right to know about rumors like that.
I know...I know...but, Nick...
Lots of Japs read English, too.
There was more to that than just a rumor.
When those 2 birds hear about it...
I'll have Ollie Miller look into it.
"Look into it"?...
We've got to get out of it!
You're going to write the retraction.
I'll write a retraction when they prove the story is false.
Nick...are you sure that piece was in the New York papers?
The Japs would have caught it on the wires, and censored it.
New Yorkers read it yesterday.
Yesterday?  Then how could you have read it?
Read it?  I wrote it.
Nick!...
Nick...for the love of Mike...
Hiya Nick...thought you'd be in jail by this time.
Somebody's going to have to slit your throat to save his face.
Aren't you a little early with that stuff?
Oh no...it just seems early.
I hear the police have collected all The Chronicles from the newsstands.
Well I hope you boys got YOUR copies.
You're welcome to cable any part of it you want.
No thanks, I want to stay in Tokyo...
I just signed a new lease.
Anybody here seen Ollie...Ollie Miller?
No...not yet.
When Ollie Miller's not at this bar... he must be sick.
- See you later.
- Sure.
Oh, there you are, Nick...
Meet Joe Cassell...
He just pulled in from Shanghai.
- Hello...
- Glad to know you.
You gonna sit down?
- Have a drink?
- Scotch and soda
3 Scotch and sodas.
Joe Cassell...Joe Cassell...?
Covered the criminal courts for the old "Tele" of New York...
Then went to Russia, then Peking...
Then I lost track.
There's fame for you, Cas!
No...that's a good memory.
Want a job?
Going home.
I was at the Foreign Office this morning...
That story of yours had them buzzing like hornets.
It was very rizzy.
Yeah...Breaks the monotony.
Where'd you did it up?
A little here...a little there.
Of course, there's not a grain of truth in it...
You know that.
I don't know anything, do YOU?
Quite a bit.
Our Chinese cousins are trying desperately to shape public opinion...
Against Japan.
What for?
To take intention off their own internal disorder.
Believe me...
"disorder" is a clean name for it.
I've just spent 4 years there...
I know.
I lived there 6 years, myself.
4 was enough for me...
Not that I haven't a tremendous admiration for the Chinese people.
I see...
"Some of my best friends are Chinese"...eh?!
Well!...At last!
Hiya fellas...Hiya Begana!
Hey Jack...did you get a load of that front page of Nick's, this morning...
Dynamite!...eh?
Hey...how about a little drink...
Set 'em up...on me!
YOU buying?!
As many as you can handle.
-I'll have a double Scotch.
- Bourbon, double.
How about you, Begana?
I'll have a little soda.
You know what I want.
But Mr Condon...
China, throughout the centuries...
Excuse please...Mr Miller is here.
Yessir!...I'm quittin'!
What? Again?
Ever see these things before?
Keep the change!
2 tickets for home on the first boat I could get...
Leaving tonight.
Where did you get the dough?
New invention.
Secret machines...press buttons...
Out comes fives...tens...hundreds!
Well in that case, how about the 2 you owe me?
A pleasure...a pleasure!
And here's the 10 that you wouldn't loan me, stinker!
Buy a round of drinks.
Excuse me, we'll continue this...
Ollie just came in...
I'll see you later.
So long, Nick.
Yessir, I'm quittin' this godforsaken land...
What has it got?
Cherry blossoms...but no cherries.
What kinda cherry trees are those?
I'll probably settle down in Connecticut... and write a book.
Yes, we'll all write a book, though.
Hiya Nick boy...!
A fine little welcome for you all over...
...and 20...a debt of long standing.
Great honor to pay!
You must have been trading in Shanghai silver!
Johnson's just gonna buy us a drink!
Where'd you get the money?
I came into it.
Come on....make sense...
What's up?
I may well take offense at the scepticism of your tone.
But I prefer to be generous and remember you as my friend...
...and former employer.
That I attribute to your bitter jealousy of my good fortune.
FORMER employer?
I'm leaving...tonight.
Me and Edith...on the "Nagata Maru".
Where did you get that money?
Nick...take a tip from me...
Come back to the States.
This place is getting hotter than the inside of Fujiyama...
Get out!...There was blood on the street this morning.
It'll be flowing like a river, before the summer's over.
You are mixed up with something shady.
Me?...Ollie Miller?!
And don't forget...Edith...Cabin 23...
Come down tonight and I'll fill you full of champagne...
..and tell you how much I love you!
"Man's best friend"...you dog!
Friends...nice people...so long!
Nick...isn't it marvellous...?
Going home!
I won't believe it 'til I'm seasick!
Great stuff!
You go on with your packing, Edy.
Yeah...I have to.
Never been early in my life.
What's it all about?
Oh Nick, you've got me...
All of a sudden everything's wonderful.
Really terrific!
And did Ollie explain it?
Oh, like he does everything else...
He dismisses it.
Didn't he say anything?
Oh, vague...very vague.
Something about a contract for a book he's going to write.
Big literary deal...advance royalties... scads of money!
Fine...fine!
Nick...I don't care where he got it.
Maybe he stole the emperor's treasures...
All I know is, we're going home.
This place is slowly killing him.
Me too.
Alright...after all Ollie's private business is still his own.
But I didn't want to see either of you getting into a jam...
...because of anything...irregular.
If there was anybody he'd tell what it was all about, it'd be you, Nick!
That's what has me worried...
He hasn't!
You'll be at the boat, tonight?
Sure...with a couple of magnums of champagne.
That should open his big mouth!
He's opened it on less.
Nick...in case I don't get a chance to tell you tonight...
You're all we going to miss in this place.
I wish you were coming back with us.
See you at the boat, beautiful!
Good evening Condon San...
You going to America?
Oh no...you're too anxious to get rid of me...
Just going to see a couple of friends of mine up on the boat.
Your name, please.
Ask Hijakata here...
He's been tailing me all day.
I am thought-control officer.
Please answer questions.
Alright...I'll give you an answer...
I'm thinking this is a new low in stupidity... even for the Imperial Police.
Now I want to see Mr and Mrs Miller in stateroom 23...
Any objections?
Not yet...Mr and Mrs Miller not yet arrived.
Well, I'll wait for them on deck.
Sorry! Not permitted tonight.
"Armstrong"...Come on, dear.
Edy!
Too bad...you refused to believe police.
Now you know...truth has been told...
You thought for yourself...
"Friends have not yet arrived."
Hello...Tokyo Chronicle, please!
Charlie Sprague.
Chronicle office.
Charlie...there's trouble...big trouble.
I can't tell you about it now..
I'm coming right down.
Find out where the ambassador is...
...and get a call through to him right away.
Right, Nick.
Did Ollie Miller reach you?
He's been trying to get in touch with you...
Said it was urgent.
Where is he?
He said he'd try to get over to your home.
Fine. Well I'll go there, then...
Switch the call there.
Ollie!
Take a sip of this.
There you are.
Ollie...can you tell me what happened?
I didn't know it was going to be so tough...
I'd have asked for more money...
You made a good guess in the paper this morning.
You won't have to guess any more, Nick.
Tanaka planned it.
I'm glad Edith got away OK.
Sorry I missed the boat.
Ollie!
What is it?
Very sorry to disturb.
So am I...Beat it!
A desperate criminal escaped police...
Maybe he is hiding here.
Sorry...we must search.
It is to protect you.
There's nobody here and I don't need anybody to protect me...
Now get out!
Have accident?
Here is criminal!
Don't you mean "victim"?
We must search house, please.
Of course, there was nothing to find... now get out of here.
Yes...but you come with us... make report.
Alright...
That's exactly what I ought to do.
If you just give me a chance to phone my office...
Not permitting telephone.
Now look here, Oshima...
I'm getting awfully tired of this.
You're chief, Yamada, is a very good friend of mine...
I don't want to have to turn you in.
Come, please.
Alright.
Condon San...
Good morning, Condon San!
Did not expect you here... except as friend.
May I use your phone?
Tokyo Chronicle, please.
You've got some explaining to do,
Yamada!
Get me Charlie Sprague!
Among other things, my government doesn't like its nationals...
...to be thrown into the jug, without any charge.
Japanese government would not do that to American, Condon San.
Here is charge.
Nicholas Condon, Managing Editor
Tokyo Chronicle...
...held private celebration in his own home...
...gaiety intense, and far-reaching...
...causing complaints from neighbors...
Complaints ignored...
...forcing police to make polite request that gaiety subdue.
Request ignored.
Police enter home at 10.30pm.
Find Nicholas Condon with 2 girls.
Two...Condon San?!
Condon very much under influence of saké.
Demand police leave.
Police demand 2 girls leave.
Condon attempt to throw police out.
Condon overcome by drink.
Friendly police put him to bed in city jail...to protect him.
You've cut me off...
Get me the Tokyo Chronicle again, please.
Because holding you in much esteem...
Man of great prestige...
No longer angry with protective police...
You are free to go.
Thanks.
Charlie!
Nick, please...go home and get a little sleep.
You had us up all last night...
We even woke the ambassador.
I don't know how we're gonna alibi it to him.
Japanese papers are full of what you did.
Never mind that...
I'm glad you got the ambassador...
Get him again and tell him I got to see him as soon as possible.
And get in your car and pick me up here.
Bring a camera!
Sgt Oshima...you know our good friend
Conon San of Tokyo Chronicle?
We have met many times.
- It's a great honor.
- It's not mutual.
You killed 2 Americans last night, Oshima...
One on the "Nagata Maru" and the other at my house.
Serious charge, Condon San.
Your have proof?
Condon San and saké have big fight last night.
Saké win!
I suppose you weren't at the harbor...
...and you weren't at my house?
Last night we take families to view cherry blossoms in moonlight.
Most pleasurable evening.
Better you forget bad dreams and go home to good sleep.
Sayonara, Condon San.
Anytime I make big joke I say...
Hope I am not too serious...too soon.
Understand...you very strong judo.
Perhaps you honor me with contest some time.
Certainly...only I hope next time it'll be face to face!
You can put your camera away...
There's the window
Ollie plowed through last night...
They've replaced it.
Replaced number one... even to the lipstick.
Replaced...number two...
They don't miss a bit.
They'd even take out the bloodstains.
They are very thorough.
What is it, Nick?
There's someone at the door...
Shall I see who it is?
Yeah...see who it is.
- Mr Condon please...
- Come in.
This is Mr Condon.
Haynoshi.
Thank you...am from Foreign Office.
Please permit me to escort you to audience...
...with his Excellency
Premier General Baron Tanaka.
Well...I'm going to be busy for a couple of hours...
Tell him I'll drop into his office sometime this afternoon.
Please...not to office...
His Excellency awaits you at his home.
Home?!
An honor!
A few minutes, please.
Won't you join us?
Not now, thank you, Prince Tatsugi... if you don't mind.
I'm afraid Iris is unhappy these days...
Unfortunately it was necessary to involve her in this distasteful affair.
Colonel Tojo advised it.
Since when, Baron Tanaka, do you concede to Colonel Tojo's sordid wishes?
I did not concede, Prince Tatsugi...
I agreed.
In the future, I would be less unhappy if I were not called upon...
...to search the effects of a woman so horribly murdered.
It will not happen again, my dear.
I promise that.
An interesting woman!
Yes.
Mixed parentage?
Yes...
- Her mother was...
- Chinese.
Baron...you know that I have communicated my fears to the emperor...
...regarding the road on which you are determined to lead the nation.
Your Highness...the decisions already have been submitted to the emperor.
Your great influence, Baron, could still check the militarists.
I am but an old man whose voice no longer carries its authority.
But you are among the most highly-esteemed in my cabinet...Your Highness.
Esteemed...esteemed as a liberal screen.
I'm the scroll of the poet, behind which samurai swords are being sharpened.
Without armed strength, we will perish.
That is my view.
Those views will lead, in time, to disaster.
We see the problem differently.
That is true.
To uphold my beliefs,
I would die with honor.
You, Baron Tanaka, will die only to erase your dishonor.
Mr Hyashi and Mr Condon.
It is a pleasure to see you again, Mr Condon.
Colonel Tojo, of the Imperial Army...
And you know Major Kudyoka,
Imperial Secret Police.
And Mr Nicholas Condon.
But please sit down.
Thank you for coming to my home.
It is more agreeable than meeting at the office.
Here we are not bothered with...newspapermen!
Your front-page story yesterday, Mr Condon, was somewhat...embarrassing.
Can't please everybody.
Of course.
We realise you had no way of knowing it was an inopportune moment for such a story.
Frankly Mr Condon, certain liberal subversive factions within our own country...
...are seeking to create an incident to weaken the present government.
They are responsible for the malicious rumor which you have regrettably printed.
As I said, Mr Condon, the story itself is unimportant...
There rumors of a document which plans world conquest...
...are ridiculous.
But...should this rumor be taken seriously by the wrong people...
A blazing fire might be kindled... which Japan would find costly to extinguish.
Oh, I see...what you are saying is...
You'd like the Chronicle to put on a "Fire Prevention Week" campaign.
Is that it?
No, Mr Condon.
Within the past 24 hours, we've discovered a plot to smuggle this forged document out of Japan.
A man by the name of Oliver Miller... one of your former employees...
..is involved.
We could recover the document from him by force...
...if we chose.
We would prefer that you persuade him to return it to us.
It seems you haven't heard,
Your Excellency...
...nor your secret police, Major... that Mr and Mrs Miller were murdered.
Last night.
We read in the papers this morning about your escapade last night, Mr Condon.
In your incoherent condition, you spoke of this unpleasant fantasy.
As we were concerned with the fate of Mr Miller, even more than you...
...we immediately made inquiries.
From the captain of the "Nagata Maru"...
A most trustworthy gentleman.
Isn't it clear to you now?
Perfectly clear.
In every detail, Mr Condon, murder is an ugly and dishonerable act...
And to prove it, some one must be accused...
Bodies must be produced.
Now, Mr Condon...to approach this problem that way...
...would only lead to many difficulties.
If you send Mr Miller a radiogram...
...I am sure he will return the document to us...
...through you.
Everyone would be enormously relieved.
And you would greatly profit.
We will all get to laugh at the strange hallucination which you experienced last night.
I see...
You want this "forgery" returned.
Yes.
And you're willing to pay plenty for it.
Alright...here's my price...
When the United States embassy is informed... that the murderers of Ollie Miller and his wife
I mean the real murderers...
Oshima and Izikata...
...Not a couple of sacrificial monkeys...
...are brought to trial and convicted.
Then, and only then...
...the thing that you're looking for may turn up.
Alright...sit down...drink?
Whisky.
For the love of Mike...
What's this about you quitting the paper?
Trying to give you a break...
You want my job, don't you?
Come on...don't toy with me...
What's up? What happened with Tanaka?
Charlie...I can't tell you much...
You'll have to be satisfied with the crumbs.
After I left Tanaka,
I went to the embassy...
We had a long talk.
Now don't ask any questions.
This much I can tell you...
They're sending me back to Washington.
OK...crumbs...but from cake!
I suppose you saw "Bright Eyes" over there?
He's been tailing me all day.
They know you're leaving... they might have other plans for you...
...Ollie-Miller-style.
Polite...but official.
Oh yeah...and one more for me.
After you finish that drink, you're going back to the office.
I want a story in tomorrow's paper that says
I'm sailing in 10 days on the "President Wilson".
Why the publicity?
If my  hunch is right, Charlie... the police did not get that document.
So it must've been the people that want to get it out of Japan.
Now, if they know I'm sailing... they may try to get in touch with me.
Don't do it Nick...keep on ice until the boat sails.
There's a one-column cut of me in the files... three-quarter face...very flattering...
Run that with the story... front page.
Hey kiddy...do me a favor, will you...
Keep an eye on my friend over there.
I say, Condon... may we join you?
It looks as if every table's taken.
I arranged it that way.
This is Nick Condon, "Tokyo Chronicle"...
Miss Iris Hilliard, just arrived from Shanghai.
I hope you'll enjoy Tokyo.
I think I'm going to.
Never mind...I do it better...
And besides...I'm not crazy.
What do you mean..."crazy"?
No man in his right mind would willingly share your company, Miss Hilliard.
How's Shanghai these days?
Oh, Shanghai's always gay.
For everyone but the Chinese.
May the waiter interrupt long enough to take your orders?
- Daiquiri.
- The same.
How was the trip over?
A little on the rough side.
I always say it's not the ocean, but the Japanese boats.
You arrived last night?
Yes.
I went down to see a couple of friends off on the "Nagata Maru" last night...
You didn't by any chance come in on that boat, did you?
Look here, Condon...
...you have a reputation for bad manners...
...but this is going too far!
It's alright, Mr Cassell.... perhaps Mr Condon can explain.
Telephone, Mr Cassell.
Excuse me.
Well?
I'm sorry.
I had kind of a rough night, last night...
I'm not quite myself today.
I read about it in this morning's paper.
Oh, that story?...
Not true.
I didn't think so.
Too much fun to be true.
May I have a cigarette?
I'd like to make a confession.
Well, we're alone.
You were right about Cassell.
He is crazy.
I insisted on coming over here.
Why?
I wanted to meet you.
You certainly know your judo, don't you?
You've had me off-balance ever since you came in.
Good!
What you're saying is that...
...you're making a play for me.
Why?
Perhaps I like your looks.
No...not with this!
There are maybe things, about that, I like.
What?
I've always liked red hair.
I grew it for you.
And the ears.
Two of those.
Isn't that good?
More would be vulgar.
Keep on! Keep on!
Pretty soon we'll level.
Alright Mr Condon...
Let's...to use your phrase...level.
I was told to meet you, by a friend.
Yes...but whose friend?
Yours...in Shanghai.
A very wonderful, almost saintly old man.
Chang Po Ling!
Yes.
Yes...wonderful!
And he asked you to look me up?
Yes.
He certainly hasn't forgotten me.
No...he remembers you very well...
As you were then.
He hoped you hadn't changed.
Just what does that mean?
First...we'll become better acquainted.
It was his desire.
His desire became mine...
5 minutes ago.
Come on, let's figure a way to go about that.
About what?
How to get better acquainted in the shortest possible time.
You see, I'm leaving in 10 days.
Oh, that's not bad...
Come on let's drink to them.
- To "them"?
- Yeah...10 days.
"The 10 days that shook the world."
Iris...my dear!
Do you know Colonel Tojo?
Of course.
And Major Kazyoka?
- Tea?
- No thank you.
Have you anything to report?
I have made SOME progress.
What progress, please?
Mr Condon find me attractive.
The introduction I arranged worked smoothly?
Excellently, thank you.
This adventure, Colonel Tojo, has many ramifications which I find displeasing.
Perhaps we can eliminate the sordid details, and learn exactly what has occurred, thus far.
Does this man possess the document?
I cannot say for certain.
I'm sure he does, Your Excellency...
It would appear so.
It is Mr Condon's ambition to leave Tokyo, in good health, within one week.
He is relying upon his embassy to protect him.
That means you must work swiftly.
Colonel Tojo...I do not need YOU, to remind me of my duty.
As far as Mr Condon is concerned, 
I have every hope for success.
Hope alone will not suffice.
Hey, Charlie...that fellow with the top-hat just going out...
Isn't he the one from the Foreign Office, who was over at my house the other day?
Hayoshi?
Yeah...why?
Oh...nothing...
Just checking...thanks.
Do you know a guy named Cassell?
A Joe Cassell?
Yeah...heard of him.
Well I just got a wire from the States about him...
They say he's a good man.
I thought I'd try him out in YOUR job after you go.
From what "States"?
You mean you just got an order from the japanese Foreign Office to put him on!
2 minutes ago.
That's an insult!
Nobody dictates to ME!
No...not even your own conscience.
You promised Charlie Sprague my job, didn't you?
Well, I reconsidered...
They say Joe Cassell has got a fine record in journalism.
Yeah...great...he ran a paper in China that posed as "the friend of the people"...
And on the side, he set up a patriotic organization... 
...that collected nickels and dimes from the poor Chinese in the States...
...to print anti-Japanese propaganda.
What of it?
Nothing much...but instead of printing the leaflets...
...he lost the money in the stock market.
60,000 bucks!
His partner committed suicide... and Cassell decided on a change of climate.
I don't suppose you can prove that?
Alright...if that isn't enough...
I'll dig up something that'll make even YOUR stomach crawl.
But if you've got any sense...
You'll stick to Charlie Sprague.
Will you stop trying to run my paper!
Yes...right now!
OK...OK...I'll give it some more thought.
Hey, Nick...where are you going?
What do the Japanese say?...
"If the flower is to be beautiful... it must be cultivated."
Come on...
Do you know what this chase has done for me?...
...Developed a ravenous appetite!
I've developed a few, myself.
- Must we really avoid him?
- No... Come on.
Thanks kiddy!
We are about to dine at Sato's.
Excellent restaurant.
We thought you'd like it.
Nothing too good for the Imperial Secret Police!
Thank you.
You like it, eh?
Japan is lovely.
What I've seen of it in 3 days.
The scenery is alright... but some of the inhabitants I object to.
The higher up you go, the lower-grade people you meet.
But I'm lucky...
...that I don't have to meet any highly-placed Japanese in my work.
- Work?
- Of course.
Namely?
I'm studying the problems of Japanese women.
Why?
For a friend in Shanghai.
Now don't tell me that's why he told you to get in touch with me.
Nick...you know so much... and still you're so ignorant about women.
Ignorant...but awfully willing.
Do you know anything at all about Japanese women?
Now, what kind of a question is that?
Academic or personal?
You won't be serious!
Oh, I'll be serious.
They're not considered human beings.
They're not even allowed to think.
It's against the law.
I imagine they "bootleg" a thought now and then.
Yes..."bootleg" thinking... that's not good enough.
And so...you've elected to help them.
Why not?
I'm a woman.
I've been aware of that for some time.
The Chinese women are just beginning to learn...
...what it could mean to be free.
If the Japanese women felt the same way...
You mean that might stop...Tanaka...
...Tojo...Yamoto, and all the rest?
It might help.
This Tanaka plan...
What do you know about it?
Why don't you tell ME?
I haven't published any articles on the subject.
Why don't I just kill him off?
I think I know a less violent solution.
Wait a minute...
Watch!
Don't wait up for me, kiddy!
- Do you mind?
- No...
Very nice!
Somebody been expecting us?
Help yourself.
- You?  - Please.
How about one for Hijakata out there?
Let him suffer.
You've got a pretty good notion there.
Do you understand Chinese?
I'm afraid she's hopelessly romantic.
She's not exactly my type, but...
On the other hand...with a few alterations... you'd be...
What sort of alterations?
This is just kind of a game...
Rule 1...
Learn never to interrupt a conversation when it begins to get interesting.
Rule 2...
Whenever you sit, always sit with your chin tilted up like this...
Like this?
Perfect.
When did you leave China, Nick?
There goes Rule 1!
I left China 2 years ago...
Left Brooklyn 15 years ago...
Cleveland 10 years ago...
Kansas City in the summer of 1921.
Now would you like me to go all through the towns very quickly...
...Just sort of get them out of the way?
I don't think that'll be necessary.
Well I just wanted to make sure 
I'd cover everything... 
...that you might interrupt with.
I'm afraid I'll have to interrupt you, Nick.
Why?
I was just thinking...
You were thinking of changing the subject again!
Now...let me tell  you what I'M thinking...
I think I know.
And I like it very much.
But I don't believe you really know what you think of me.
Maybe I do.
Desirable woman?
Much more than that.
Be sensible, Nick...
What I'm trying to tell you...
That I'm half Chinese...
I'm half Irish and half Norwegian!
It isn't the same thing.
What are you trying to do... run down the Irish?
Thank you, Nick.
Stop it...how but I hate gratitude! it's a very debasing emotion.
You just keep your mind on the game.
That's Rule 1.
Rule 2...
Have you played this game before?
Maybe when you learn a little more about THESE people...
...you might revise your opinions about the Chinese.
Maybe, but the farther west I've gone, the more I'm convinced...
...that wisdom and civilisation come from the East.
That's what I say!
China!
Japan is east of China.
You should do well here, Mr Cassell.
How about this?
Excuse me, gentlemen...
I'll see you later.
What is it....what's it all about?
Colonel...this is an outrage!
I won't tolerate it!
You seem to forget my position and influence.
Perhaps you do not have them any longer, Mr Cassell.
Have you seen His Excellency Baron Tanaka?
If he'd seen me, 
I wouldn't be here.
Be reasonable, Colonel...
All you want was to hold till China be killed.
It didn't happen the way we planned it, but what's the difference?
We are just as much concerned in the manner in which these matters are accomplished.
Now, His Imperial Majesty's government will have to make it very clear...
...we were never acquainted with you.
But where's that leave me?
I've lost my friends in China, and now...
Precisely!
Surely you must realise, Mr Cassell...
When he, who is not a good friend of China... cannot be a good friend of Japan.
Most regrettable.
Good day.
OK...OK!
Don't get me wrong, Condon...
I don't blame you...
It was my mistake...
I don't know what got into me.
The Chinese are great people...
I love them...
If you'd only come to me before printing the story, and stopped me...
Knocked some good sense into my head.
It isn't brains you're short of, Cassell...
I know but...
It was like doubling up...
Letting the money ride on a good bet...
I couldn't pass it up.
Get out of here!
Wait a minute...
You're a decent icon...
And I've got an idea that'll work for both of us.
You're in a worse spot than I am.
They're not going to let you out of the country alive.
But they don't suspect me.
You set the price...half a million... anything you say...
Let me take it to China, and set myself up again with the right people...
You'll collect the money in America.
Take what to China?
The Tanaka plan.
You've got it, Condon.
Tanaka's already made you an offer... but you're holding out for more.
I know.
Oh yeah?
Well, what else do you know?
Plenty...didn't I frame the introduction... for Tanaka...
...between you and the Hilliard dame?
Don't I know she hasn't had any luck yet because you're playing cagey.
What else?
That's funny...you smear me for selling out China...
...while you're selling out your own country.
Nick...what is this?
Now that we know each other... start talking!
Start talking...
You were at Yadakamado that night.
What if I was?
- You work for Tanaka!
- No!
That's a lie!
Thought you were going great, didn't you?
Had me shooting off my mouth about the wonderful Chinese people...
Tied me up with Chang Po Ling...
You were going to have a case of espionage built up against me, and have me boxed.
I'd give up the Tanaka memorial...
...or else spend the next 10 years of my life in a dirty Jap prison.
Very cute.
But you made one slip!
You thought you'd build yourself up with me by spilling that story on Cassell.
It didn't work!...He talked!
Can I say something?
Yes...plenty!...
To the United States embassy.
You're going to tell them how YOU killed Edith Miller!
- I didn't!
-Well you know who did!
And who killed her husband.
You go down into the sewer with dirty rats like Tanaka...
Then come to me with your
"Freedom for women"...
"Equal rights for all people"...
"Love of humanity"!
Well, who killed them?...the names...
Oshima and who else?
What would you give for the names?
The Tanaka memorial?
It's too late for that kind of deal now.
What is your price then for the document?
That hardly answers my question.
Alright...I'll give it to you in your own language...
It may come as a surprise to you... but these things can't buy everything.
There isn't money enough in all Japan, to buy that document.
What are you risking your life for?
To protect people in China and America that you don't even know?
To save humanity?
Come on...let's get over to the embassy.
Are you sure?
Are you sure you'd risk your life to protect the Tanaka plan?...
If you had it.
Oh, don't worry...I have it!
No, you haven't.
I have.
Is this more of your lies?
No, Nick.
You wait on the terrace...
I'll bring it to you.
Where'd you get this?
Where did you put it?
The portrait of the emperor held no fears for me.
- When the police left...
- Where were you?
In your garden. it was an awfully good fight you put up, Nick.
But when Oshima hit you from behind...
He hits awfully hard.
So this is it, eh?
This is it.
"Memorial to His Imperial Majesty" by Premier Tanaka.
Outlining the positive policy of Japan.
Tell me...
How close did I come?...
In my article the other day.
You missed, Nick... by millions of square miles.
This is a plan for world conquest.
Manchuria is only the beginning.
All of China...then America...
Oh no...wait a minute...
What do you think WE'll be doing when all of this is going on?
Sleeping.
Until the bombs start falling on you...
They're counting on that, Nick.
That's why it's so important to get this to the outside world.
To China...to YOUR country.
Now, before the plan goes into full operation.
Well, the Japanese are going to claim it's a forgery.
And they'll scream "Fraud!" all over the place.
What we've got to do is to find some means...
....to keep them from squirming out of it.
That can be done, too.
This document CAN be authenticated...
...with the signature of someone who was present when the plan was drawn up.
Are you sure of that?
I'm sure of that.
Darling...
How did you get mixed up in this?
It's my work.
Well, I can think of easier ways of making a living.
Not for me.
Big payoff, eh?
Yes.
A free China.
That's why I had to be so careful, Nick, about telling you.
I had to be sure how you felt about it.
And about you.
Nick...
The other evening I said I wished we'd met 2 years ago...
I couldn't tell you why then.
I suddenly became afraid...
...that the thing I wanted most for you to say yes...you'd take the chance...
...would come too swiftly.
It would end for us before it could begin.
I suddenly wanted the moment of your decision pushed back months...
Years.
Wait a minute, darling...
I'm still alive.
Yes, Nick...very much.
So much so that...I can't bear to think of it otherwise.
Thank you.
Sit down.
You are not displeased that I suddenly begged this cocktail?
I intended to see you later this evening...
But some rather important matters demand my attention.
I am concerned about your work.
I had hoped you might have completed your mission by now.
And that the document we seek might already be in your hands.
I should be very happy when all this is over and forgotten.
I'm afraid that politics and intrigue are not my special talents.
Sometimes I get a little frightened.
I understand, Iris.
I promise...for you there will be no more politics.
No more intrigue...
No more spying.
I should be very grateful.
It is I who am grateful.
In fact, I have brought you a little gift, in reward.
It is something I picked up at the silversmith on my way over.
I guess you were expecting more rubies?
I haven't forgotten how you love them.
Oh no...these are quite lovely.
"A virtuous woman, who can buy?
For her price is far above...rubies."
A quotation?
From the Christian Bible.
It should remind you of something else.
From the same source.
The coins...count them...
30 coins...
30 pieces of silver!
No...I'm not going to kill you.
I'm going to give you a chance to save your life...
..and MY honor.
The fact that you betrayed me was discovered by Colonel Tojo.
I've managed to save face thus far...
...by informing him that your actions were part of a plan of mine...
...through which I could obtain the name of the traitor within our government...
...with whom you have been working.
Now...
What is his name?
Very well...
...you have 2 hours in which to make your decision.
If, at the end of that time, I do not receive a call from you, naming the traitor...
...your fate will be in the hands of Colonel Tojo.
Weigh carefully the possibilities of such a future!
Don't attempt to leave the hotel or use the telephone, as it will be useless.
I will await your call.
Get me the "Tokyo Chronicle" office please.
Sorry...only calls to Baron Tanaka will be accepted from your suite.
You will see that the woman is punished.
Death, that comes quickly, is not punishment.
There are other forms which are slow, which must be painfully absorbed.
Yes, Excellency!
I have plans for our divine emperor...
For his rule, and power.
In the execution of these plans,
I have failed.
From my own stupidity 
I have been deceived...
...and thus dishonored 
His Imperial Majesty.
To you, Captain Yamamoto...
To you, Colonel Tojo...
...I pass the sacred obligation which I have betrayed.
I charge you a pledge...
I pledge you, never to sheathe the sword of the samurai...
...until our victorious armies march as conquerors...
...through the streets of every capital of the world.
I swear the same.
America will be crushed... never to rise again.
The gods are kind...
I will be in the White House when Japan dictates her terms of peace.
Meet me before the shrine, where we will do what must be done.
Is everything in readiness?
Yes, Your Excellency.
I have been considering your past services to us.
They have not been without value.
Thank you, Colonel Tojo...
You know, I've always been a friend of Japan's.
Japan does not forget her friends.
There is a way in which you can re-establish yourself.
An exclusive news story of the first magnitude.
I'll be right over!
In a half an hour.
There must be something wrong, Charlie...
I've been trying to get her all morning.
Did Miss Hilliard have any visitors yesterday?
Yes...Baron Tanaka.
Baron Tanaka!?
You know where he is now, don't you?
With his ancestors.
Come on...open up!
There's something fishy about that press release.
Where did Cassell come off... to grab an exclusive?
If you ask me, Charlie the stroke that killed Tanaka had a very sharp edge to it.
Oh, Miss Hilliard!
Well?
They didn't get her...
She took a run-out powder.
Could be after the baggage.
Come right in.
4-piece luggage... now check please.
Alright...I'll take your word for it.
Sorry...must count.
Alright...let's get going.
Have another drink.
- It's a frame, Nick.
- Easy...easy!
Hijakata 'll be outside somewhere.
She's had almost a week to contact you.
Why does she wait till three hours before your boat sails.
I told you that dame was no good...
She's trying to hang a spar up on you.
Can't you see it?
Don't go, Nick, for the love of...
Let me see who it is.
No, you wait here.
It's Johnny Clarke from the embassy.
I'm certainly relieved to find you here, Nick.
Why...where did you expect to find me?
Frankly, in a Japanese dungeon.
I told you.
What's the story?
You've got a friend somewhere on this island, Nick...
We received a phone call from him at the embassy, 20 minutes ago.
Who was it?
Anonymous.
A warrant is to be sworn out for your arrest.
You're to be held for questioning, suspected of being a Chinese agent.
The ambassador sent me over in HIS car.
Official American property can't be violated.
So...I'm to put you on the "Wilson" at once... in the charge of the captain.
Great...you'll be immune...
You'll be a diplomatic pouch.
It's the only way Nick...
If they once catch you, it's a long legal tangle.
Before we can do anything... weeks...maybe months.
Come on Nick...bon voyage...
Now get going!
Thanks, Johnny...
I'll see you at the embassy
 in about an hour.
Well...we won't be responsible, you know.
Mr Condon!
Light up in there.
A whole week... and not a word from you.
I couldn't get a word to you before this.
You could have gotten word to me some way!
You still don't trust me.
I do trust you.
I worked that out myself, an hour ago.
I think I can prove to you that it was worth it.
Come with me.
Mr Condon...
I'm quite certain you will agree...
...there is very little time to waste on explanation.
Miss Hilliard and I feel it would serve our purpose most effectively...
...if I signed the document in your presence.
Naturally, when this is made public...
...its authenticity will not go unchallenged.
My signature will be branded a forgery, by our government...
...including the emperor.
In that event, Your Highness, your voice will give them the lie.
The length of elapsed time... 
...between the publication of this document and my ability to speak...
...will be very brief.
In Japan...a traitor's voice is quickly silenced.
Mr Condon. I take my part in this... not for YOUR country...
...but for mine.
I would rather see Japan defeated...
...than triumphant under the heels of our militarists.
Lady...would you mind very much if I were to kiss you?
I don't believe I'd have the strength to move from this spot, until you did.
And now...we've got to get out of here.
It's all been arranged.
In a few minutes, a fishing boat will take us to a freighter on the lower bay.
Us?
You're going with me, Nick.
They're planning to hold you for questioning.
Once they get you...
I had an idea it was you who warned the embassy there was a warrant out for me.
They want to send me out with diplomatic immunity.
Diplomatic immunity won't stop a bullet, or a bomb under a car.
Rough, are they?
Leave with us, Nick...
For me.
For you?!
Are you worth that?
Alright!
Why didn't you tell me?
Nick...this way...
Wait...
Police everywhere...hurry!
You'll have to take it out, darling...
I'll hold them here, till you get a start.
No...they'll kill you!
Get going!
Nick!...if they'll kill you...
The plan is all they want!
We can't do that!
We've got jobs to do...nobody gave them to us but they've got to be done...
You're my girl, aren't you?
You're going to do what I want you to do...
I know it's tough...
It's tougher to go than it is to stay...
...but you can't hold them, and I think I can.
Alright, Nick.
I'm your girl.
Given up strangling...eh, Oshima?
Oh, that's right... you HAD given it up...
You shot Ollie Miller...
It was his wife who was strangled, wasn't it?
Yes!
I see your point...
When it comes to taking a man with your bare hands...
...it's rather risky, isn't it?
You're very clever Mr Condon...
...but there's one flaw in your cleverness...
It's as easy to kill you with these... as with that!
In fact, I prefer it that way!
Japanese-fashion!
Kabé...check the men!
Condon has escaped from the docks.
Now he comes here.
Driver!...
Drive past Haka Street.
Look at this!
So sorry, Mr Condon...
...to take plan from you...
But you see...
Japanese very smart!
Only half-smart, flunky!
Only half-smart.
Get out of my way!
Hello, fella!
I said I'd be back in an hour...
Sorry I'm a few minutes late.
Yamada, this is not going to be treated... 
...as another of your very regrettable mistakes!
Condon is an enemy of Imperial Japan...
Insist he must be...
Extremely sorry this has been the result, Mr Clarke...
It is true, Condon has been enemy of Japan...
But Japanese people very good... very generous.
We will forget bad actions of Condon and say no more.
You, in turn will forget this incident?
What's the matter, Yamada?
Afraid of the penalty for failure?
What is much simpler this way...
Both sides have made mistake.
Will be very embarrassing for all.
The United States government doesn't settle for a deal, Yamada.
Condon San...
Condon San...you have saying...
"Forgive your enemies"
I am willing.
Sure...forgive your enemies!
But, first, get even!

BATTLE OF THE RAILS
In June 1940 the Germans cut France in two, separating friends and family and blocking equipment and supplies behind the demarcation line, dividing the country into an occupied zone and a so-called "free" zone.
Linking the two zones, but under strict enemy control, were the railways.
France had to maintain its inner unity and relations with the outside world.
The barrier erected by the enemy had to be crossed by both the past and men.
The railways took on this task, its first form of resistance.
Growing bolder under the regime of terror, over four years they developed a fearsome weapon.
The day of the landings, they contributed considerably to disorganising transportation and to defeating the Germans in the battle for liberation.
Jews! It is strictly forbidden to cross the demarcation line into the occupied zone.
The train has arrived at Chalon-sur-Saône.
It will stop for 20 minutes.
Would passengers please produce their identity papers and passes, ready to be checked by the occupation authorities.
Please do not block the corridors.
Papers, please.
Thank you, madam.
- Checking!
- Stay there!
Dog for Lyon
Fill with water, now!
It's done!
Faster!
It's done.
I told you, it's done!
You're already late, you can do that further along!
All right, go.
You will now witness a very precise mechanism...
Command Post
From this command past, trains are directed and followed.
During the occupation these were often military transports: TCOs.
This is how it would work.
This gentleman requests a TCO of 50 wagons...
Hello? We need a 50-wagon train.
It's for a TCO.
The railwaymen take the greatest care over the TCO, cutting no corners and creating considerable delays.
Always with the greatest discretion.
- A bad wagon.
- No, no!
- Yes.
- No!
It should be scrapped,
I'm telling you.
- How long?
- An hour.
- Too much long!
- Too bad.
For a TCO?
I've only got one available.
You'll have to wait an hour for it.
Everything is in order on the traffic board too.
The command past is in direct contact with all the region's stations.
This chart shows a projection of all railway traffic.
That's the theory.
The reality is this other chart, on which the operator marks down the trains' progress according to their real positions.
The S1288 has just left.
When will it get to Sarrey?
On time... Plus forty minutes.
Corbin Station here. The S1288 is arriving, 58 minutes late.
To number their trains the Germans use indecipherable codes, which the railwaymen soon decipher.
Into the cogs of this precise mechanism the railwaymen insert pebbles, making it malfunction.
It doesn't run smoothly, it resists.
And who's behind this resistance?
Let's find out.
I've nothing more to explain.
- Cards tonight.
- Right.
- A new player.
- Good.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello.
- How's the old man?
- Fine.
Here's the new one
I told you about.
Well, I never!
Missus!
Careful now...
No messing about.
His name's Athos, what's yours?
Camargue.
Your tasks are to find sympathisers, gather intelligence and transmit it.
- I've got the lists.
- And the pamphlets?
You'll find them you know where.
- I'm in.
- OK?
Thanks.
I can get a few blokes together to distribute the pamphlets.
- Up to you.
- Trump!
Are there many of you?
A few more just coming.
Come on, get a move on!
There are a thousand ways to cause trouble for them.
I'm counting on you.
You can stop the wagons from leaving France...
You can cut the brakes...
You, Louis, can see to the fuel...
It's a magnetic bomb, it sticks all by itself.
Look.
There are two magnets, here and here.
Put it on something made of iron.
Watch out, Krauts!
Hide in the bays!
They're coming.
Air raid.
Everyone into the air-raid shelter.
That was close.
Sabotage of machines
Sabotage of supplies
After the friendly advice, the threats...
Plastered everywhere.
Death penalty for saboteurs
No passing!
- Move!
- What is it now?
Come on, Louis, they need an interpreter.
- Do you speak German?
- Yes.
You can interpret.
Comrades.
I must announce that acts of sabotage are being committed all the time.
This must stop.
We are fighting together on behalf of the same cause.
We are working together for the civilisation of the world.
We are reaching out to you.
But if you do not obey us, we shall have no choice but to crush you.
Translate!
He says..."Comrades, there's too much sabotage."
And he says...
"We're all working for the same cause."
Louder!
He says, "We're holding out our hand to you,
"but if you reply with your fist, we'll crush you."
Conclusion: ten German trains should have left that evening.
And six men, two groups of three, were arrested as hostages.
But words have no power here...
Get out, quick!
Come with me!
Get over here!
Wait.
- What do we do it with it?
- Hide it till later!
Hide it.
Here, deal with this.
Finish up here,
I've got other things to do.
Aim.
Fire!
3 wagons of concentrated milk
15 of flour
2 of tinned fish
8 tons of sugar leaving for Stuttgart
All this stuff for a month now.
Yeah, and ore too.
Here, get this to the radio.
Quantities sent to Germany from the 15th to the 30th.
This is London calling.
The French speaking to the French.
First, a few personal messages.
The hawthorn is in flower.
The presbytery has lost none of its charm.
Twice.
Veronese is a great painter.
The cat is out of the bag.
That's it!
They've landed!
Get the map out.
They've landed.
Where do you reckon?
This stretch is seriously at risk.
It's vulnerable to attack.
It needs reinforcing immediately.
So we use...?
- The roads.
- No, the railway.
Transport Command
Twelve trains for the western front.
What about the Apfelkern convoy?
This way?
No, not the main line. Terrorists.
They won't expect us there.
They're preparing troop transports.
They'll take the single track, not the main line.
All we'd have to do is blow up the bridge at Corbin.
It'd be great if they never got there.
Order to prepare a 12-train convoy.
The first train: S1504-322-425.
The convoy's name is Apfelkern.
- Apfelkern? What does that mean?
- Appleseed.
- What?
- Appleseed.
For Corbin.
They daren't tell us the whole route.
Excuse me.
Corbin here.
The bridge has been blown up.
The Apfelkern convoy will have to go on the main line.
Always the same!
Command post?
Convoy S1504 at 3.45 pm.
The convoy is on time.
Langres Station here.
The line has just been blown up.
Post 3. Halt convoy S1504.
No! Divert it.
Yes. Divert it via St-André.
Divert it via St-André.
- Do you understand?
- Shall I go?
- Right away.
- Now?
22nd July 1944
S1504 for 23/7
Hello, pal.
All right? Bon appétit!
Know why I'm here?
Yes, go ahead.
You got an engine here?
Yes, but not ready.
The boiler's empty.
- I can't fill it using buckets!
- Why not?
What a job!
It'll be hard work.
And I'll get shot after.
We'll tie you up.
Blame it on the Maquis.
We have to make sure the convoy doesn't get past.
But I've no one to get it going.
Unless...
There's Jules, the retired engine driver.
- Why not?
- Come on.
Don't go, Jules! They're all mad!
Can't you see he's too old?
I'm coming.
But I'll need someone to help me.
There's old Victor.
What a job!
Who did that?
We don't know.
It's Louis.
He came to blow the line.
Get a move on.
If the Germans show up, we're defenceless.
Come on.
Take out these two.
- What a job!
- Have a swig.
The wagons on line one, the engine on line two.
Now for the engine. Down you get.
- How far away is the break?
- 800 metres.
Yes, I understand.
See you, pal.
St-André Station here.
They've blown the line, and derailed an engine and 8 wagons.
- When?
- Last night.
And you tell us now?
I was tied up and they cut the phone lines.
Only three out of seven trains arrived.
Why hasn't the convoy arrived yet?
It's your responsibility.
Yes, sir!
- Repair now.
- We can't get a crane.
- There's a 30-ton crane.
- Ask for it, you'll see!
It's for you.
Weissmüller!
Where is the Apfelkern convoy?
It must arrive without fail, whatever it takes.
I'm making you responsible.
Yes, sir.
Get a 30-ton crane to St-André Station immediately, to lift a locomotive and 8 wagons.
Impossible.
We haven't got a locomotive for the crane.
I repeat!
I need a crane immediately.
We only have one stand-by engine.
That's for the convoy.
I don't care how, just get the crane there!
OK, we'll give you the stand-by engine.
It's coming.
Lower it.
How long to clear the line?
- Three hours.
- Fine.
We'll do our best.
We'll start with the first wagon.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, we'll count them.
I'm all right.
- Sabotage, sabotage!
- What can I do about it?
Clear up all this!
I'd need a 50-ton crane to lift this one.
I need another crane.
A 50-ton crane!
50 tons. Hurry!
- How long?
- I need to have a look first.
Come on.
- One, two...
- Three hours for the wagons.
This changes everything.
Well?
Even if we work all night, not before tomorrow evening.
It's impossible, we can't do otherwise.
This train has to...
Impossible!
Clear all this up!
Take that.
The bastards!
They're going to get past.
It was a good plan too.
We'll see about that.
Watch the road, by the woods there.
Watch that spot.
Everything's ready.
Hide on either side.
Hey, you lot, hurry up!
Halt!
Get this fixed right away.
Hands up!
Bastard!
Go on!
Go on, walk.
You watch over there.
And you, this side.
Get the pressure up to maximum and then get down.
What are you doing? Get down!
All right?
Yeah, fine.
We won't be getting home for a while.
You're not going to blow her up?
Never mind.
More bloody trouble!
St-André here.
A runaway train just went through!
There's a work party on the line.
I can't warn them by phone!
We've only got a few minutes.
Phone post 7, tell them to half-open the points.
It won't go any further.
Post 7.
Post 7? Half-open the points.
What? Derail the train?
Which train?
The crane?
- What are you doing?
- Never mind. Get out of here!
Just the heel broken!
That's just great!
Command post.
Post 7 here.
The train's gone through.
No derailment. Just the heel of the switch point broken.
There's a slope, but after the works.
St-André here.
The 404 just went by, at 9.13 pm.
They're still at it.
We've had the Krauts going in circles for two weeks now.
From diversion to diversion, they can't make it out of the region.
Hence the armoured train.
The only way they're safe.
But more than that...
- They're all tight together now.
- What do you mean?
I'll explain.
This is the armoured train.
Then the other trains in the convoy, as close together as possible.
The armoured train in the lead, the others following.
In front, a wagon with spare rails.
If there's a break, they stop, and they do the repair immediately.
And all the other trains follow close behind, so there's no sabotage between them.
We have to blow the armoured train, see?
Here, for you.
- What's new?
- Nothing.
What's an armoured train like?
Like a goods train.
You know what I mean.
With cattle trucks.
They put rail sleepers inside, and...
Forced labour workers behind sandbags.
Anti-tank guns?
Of course. They're well defended.
Why, are you scared?
It's not that.
Wish you were home, eh?
No, I wish the fight had started.
You want to see the Krauts?
I want to see myself.
You can never be sure of yourself.
You can be sure of this.
It'll pierce metal 10-cm thick.
A pity we only have one.
- What?
- A pity we only have one.
Hardly any reinforcements by rail, and by road they're short of petrol.
For which they can blame us.
In any case, I never delivered any!
It's taking ages.
Who's that with Masson?
Louis. The one sent from the centre with our instructions.
- Well, well!
- What?
A glow-worm. So what?
- I've never seen one before.
- No?
We don't use them for street lighting in Paris!
I've learnt some stuff over this last year.
Rye, barley, colza... Glow-worms!
Colorado beetles, green beans...
No, not like that!
What are you doing? There!
- Do you think they'll come?
- Louis wouldn't be here otherwise.
An armoured train... followed... by a convoy... S1504.
This is it! It's passed Buisson.
Watch out!
Halt!
Can we?
Get down, lads!
Damn it!
There!
Prepare to fire!
Load!
- Ready to fire.
- Good.
Ready to fire.
Good. Ready to fire.
Fire battery volley!
They're hit!
Come with me!
We can't do anything against that!
What are the others doing with their bazooka?
Pull!
A bit further!
Stop!
- Drop it!
- Watch your feet!
To the outside!
Roll it to the outside!
Roll it!
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.
I heard you wanted to see me.
Yes, but first I'd like to borrow your office, so Mr Roussel and I can finish our work.
Be my guest, sir.
So, can you tell me anything about this convoy, Apfelkern?
It's a very sorry story, sir.
Bad luck coupled with terrorist attacks.
Yes, I know.
We have the Transport
Kommandantur on our backs.
It's been going on for two weeks.
Quite a tour de force!
So it seems, from my work in the command post.
Quite a tour de force, in the opinion of my friend Castenet, who asked me to congratulate you on such good work.
Ah, Castenet...
We work together.
So it was to you he transmitted...
We can save some time.
We're going to have to work fast, and on a much larger scale.
Another 11 trains are to be diverted onto the electric network.
We need to take extreme measures.
We have to intervene between two trains.
- There's no time between them.
- There is!
It's dangerous for the crew.
Don't worry. Lampin has already done two derailings.
But he'd like the chance of killing some more Krauts.
- OK.
- Goodbye.
- Finished?
- But the left axles need checking.
- Seen Lampin?
- He's over there.
Thanks.
Did you request the 1504?
How do you know I did?
I know these sorts of things.
Careful!
That little pig has big ears!
We want to derail the first train after the armoured one.
The Krauts will never think we'll dare do it.
The only thing is, the trains are so close together that the explosives will go off as your train's passing.
You know the curve after Lissac?
That's where we'll have to do it.
I'll try.
It's all happening in Normandy.
Reinforcements mustn't arrive.
It's a question of days.
If you don't feel up to this, old pal, no one'll hold it against you.
Ten tanks less in a battle can change the outcome.
What about your mate?
He's always with me.
Remember.
At the 212-km mark.
Are you getting changed?
As you can see.
I didn't think of that.
Well, you're young.
You're smart enough already.
I left a bike tyre in my locker.
It's for my wife.
Remind me tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Hey!
If you see Rossignac, tell him I've gone.
All right.
Ready?
We're ready.
Jump to the left, not down the ravine.
Reckon we'll survive?
We'll see it through to the end, anyway.
We've had it!
- Jump!
- I can't leave you.
Jump, I said!
Who's in charge here?
Join the Maquis.
Why lose two when one can do the job?
It's over to you now.
Eleven trains in a row.
Bellay substation? Cut the current.
What? We can't do that!
Cut the current!
- Go!
- There's no current.
- Prove it!
- Phone if you don't believe me.
It's back there.
- Speak.
- There's no current.
They're going to shoot us!
Put it back on.
We'll get them later.
Restore the current.
Broken down on every line.
Take all locomotive engines to pull trains on electric lines.
Now, old pal... the locomotives!
What?
Resistance order: dump the fires!
Here! "Apfelkern troop convoy.
"Ten trains immobilised.
Waiting between V and B."
Air raid!
Lights out!
Lange Station here.
The bridge has just blown!
Post 7 here.
The tunnel's blocked, the line is cut!
The Free French are here.
Roadblocks everywhere!
The Krauts are trapped!
50 prisoners already!
They've got weapons, then!
There's a Kraut convoy in retreat!
Not many trains still running.
They're stealing all the bikes!
The convoy was bombed by the English the other night.
They're running away!
Things are looking up.
Locomotive!
Station staff only
What the hell are they doing now?
Stop!
What's going on?
Reserved for occupation troops
Post 9 here.
A train of Germans is heading to Sarrey to blow it up.
Stop them!
I can't!
We have to save the material now.
I'll make the Germans think the Americans are there.
Let German HQ know the Americans are at Sarrey.
Switch the points.
- The Americans are at Sarrey.
- Not true!
I want to see for myself.
- Telephone.
- There.
Transport command.
Where are the Americans? In Sarrey?
So it's true!
We're going back.
Come on, move!
We've been liberated!
Nice one, lads! We beat them, eh?
St-André here.
We've hoisted the flag.
With machine-guns still firing.
Hang on...
They've fixed the rail. Listen...
The first train's about to leave.
It's been decorated.
Flags and banners all over it.
People are throwing flowers, everyone's on the platform.
Just listen...
Post 8 here.
The first train, the 122, at 2.45...
You do the first one.
Vive la France and all the railwaymen!
Got him. Right on the nose.
It's all right. He had it coming to him.
He's always making trouble.
One of these days, Tarzan'll get mad... and that'll be the end of Mr. Leopard.
Cheetah, don't get too rough.
He's only a baby.
You better stop, Cheetah.
If his mother shows up, she'll eat your head off.
Tarzan's going for a swim.
Swim.
Cheetah, stop teasing Buli.
Cheetah, I warn you now.
Stop teasing Buli.
I suppose they just wouldn't be happy if they weren't wrangling all the time.
Buli happy, Cheetah happy, Jane happy...
Tarzan happy.
Tarzan, stop it.
Hey, look what I found.
Shiny stones. Real heavy ones, too.
Just right for my sling.
Boy, let me see those stones a moment.
- Where'd you find them?
- At the bottom of the pool.
They're gold.
- Gold nuggets.
- Gold?
Nuggets?
Yes. Lumps of a very precious metal.
More nuggets up mountain. Big nuggets.
If people in the outside world heard there was gold here...
they'd come swarming up here like an army of ants.
Why, Mother?
Back in civilization, darling, one can buy anything one wants with gold.
Almost.
Buy? What's "buy"?
Well, supposing I have some fruit and Tarzan's hungry...
Tarzan gives me the gold, and I give him the fruit.
Tarzan hungry. Want dinner.
Cheetah's choking on the gold.
Gold no good. Tarzan get dinner.
And so you see, here when we want food...
Tarzan just goes out and catches it.
Mother, why do people in...
Civilization?
Yes, but why do they have to buy clothes, food, and houses? Why?
Darling, I honestly don't know.
It's a problem they've been trying to settle for hundreds of years... and they haven't settled it yet.
At least they hadn't when I left.
What else do they have in the civilization, Mother?
Lots of things.
There's the radio, for instance.
It's like a box, and you can hear music and voices coming right out of it.
You mean the box can talk?
Not really. But the voices come out of it... and it sounds as though people were right there in the box talking.
Are the eggs done yet, Cheetah?
Not yet?
Tarzan, what lovely grapes.
Tell me some more about civilization, Mother.
Then they have airplanes... houses with wings that fly, and they carry people through the air.
They go faster than anything you've ever seen.
- Faster than Tarzan?
- Much faster. Faster than the wind.
Is civilization very far from here, Mother?
Now, darling, just you forget about civilization.
Our world here is far more lovely and exciting than the outside world...
I promise you.
Now, you run and get the caviar from the refrigerator.
Good, the eggs are ready.
Here, Cheetah, take these and cool them in the brook.
Doesn't this look cool and appetizing?
In the outside world, you'd have to pay quite a lot of gold for this.
For fish eggs?
When the fish eggs happen to be caviar.
Now, Cheetah, you bring the eggs over here, and no monkey business.
Cheetah, stop that.
No monkey business now, Cheetah.
Come on, Cheetah. Now, hurry up.
Cheetah, you've had enough grapes.
Come on, help with the dishes.
Gold's been used for lots of things.
But it's the first time I've seen it used for chasing hyenas.
Jane like Tarzan?
What woman wouldn't like a husband who brings her orchids?
There's a whole valley of orchids just across the river.
I know, but out in civilization they don't grow that way.
You have to be very rich to have them.
You don't realize what a very wealthy man your father is.
Who? Tarzan?
Yes, he has everything any man could want. Everything.
Tarzan have Jane.
You have Jane, all right.
You'll have me in a thousand pieces if you're not careful.
That's for the orchid.
Let's walk over to civilization tonight, Mother...
- before we go to bed.
- You've had a long and busy day.
You'll go home, say your prayers, and go to bed.
Cheetah!
Take these plates to the river and wash them. And don't break them.
Remember, no juggling.
Buli, stop that.
Leave those dishes alone.
Bad Buli. You'll wake Tarzan. Come on.
Cheetah, go home.
Cheetah, you have to go home.
You'll have to go back, Buli.
You can't cross here.
You think you're smart, pretty cute, don't you, the way you followed me?
Well, you can just go back with Buli.
Come on!
Hurry up, Cheetah! Hurry up!
Come on, Cheetah.
Stay there. I'll get you out.
That rhino was mad, all right, wasn't he?
You know where I'm going?
I'm going to civilization.
I'm going to buy an airplane.
I've got gold, see.
What did you say?
You mean friends.
Friends?
Yes, friends. You, me, friends.
Like Cheetah and me.
Friends.
What's your name?
Yes, what do they call you?
What does your mother call you?
My name's Boy.
Boy?
That's right. Boy.
Tumbo. Boy.
Juju!
That come from your village?
Juju!
Why are so many people sick, Tumbo?
She's your mother, Tumbo, isn't she?
Juju.
No, Tumbo, not juju. It's sickness.
Friend.
Tell them I didn't bring the sickness.
I didn't do it.
Well, you're safe now, lad... but what are you doing here in the middle of the African jungle?
I live here, up on the escarpment.
Come on, Tumbo. Friends.
- Friends?
- This is Tumbo, he's my friend.
Nice work, O'Doul.
- What's the matter?
- He's fainted. Get some brandy.
Make it Irish whiskey, please.
Better make a run for it.
It's Tarzan!
Tarzan!
Tarzan? Then there really is a Tarzan.
For years I've been hearing about him from the natives.
The White Ape Man they call him, the King of the Jungle.
- Boy all right?
- I'm fine.
You came just in time, Tarzan.
Where's Mother?
Jane wait.
Is she gonna punish me, Tarzan?
Boy wait. Boy find out.
He's the spitting image of the ancient Irish giant...
Finn McCool.
This is Tarzan. He's my father.
How do you do, Tarzan? My name's Elliott.
Tarzan thank.
We thank you.
You certainly saved our lives just now.
It looked for a while as though we were finished.
You've a fine boy there.
Fine boy, little Tarzan.
My name is O'Doul, Mr. Tarzan,
Dennis O'Doul.
You're a fine figure of a man, Mr. Tarzan.
I'll wager you have some Irish in you.
Now I'm certain of it.
This is Mr. Medford, Tarzan.
- He's my associate on this expedition.
- How do you do?
- This is Mr. Vandermeer, our guide.
- Glad to know you.
This gentleman you just shook hands with is our cameraman.
Men not need guns now.
He doesn't like guns. They kill his animals.
You needn't worry, Tarzan.
We're not hunters, we're scientists.
We're trying to find an almost forgotten tribe called the Van-usi.
They're a people that wandered down from Asia into Africa ages ago.
Ever hear of them?
Van-usi? Live up Fyn Mano River.
That's just where we figured to find them.
We were trying to find a pass across the mountains... when we came across this village.
Safari can't cross mountain.
All ice and snow.
Did you hear that?
I know it will be a hard job...
but I figure we could make it in eight or ten weeks.
Men die.
Tarzan take safari up escarpment.
Reach river six days.
- Six days?
- That'd be a tremendous help.
Men help Boy, Tarzan help men. Come.
I don't know how to thank you.
This is Tumbo. He's my friend.
His mother just died from the sickness.
Mother die?
Look at this house on wheels.
It runs and makes noises like an elephant.
Is there an elephant inside?
Well, not exactly an elephant, but it's 125 horses.
It's an automobile, a truck.
- Truck?
- Horses? Where?
What are horses?
Well, they're like zebras.
They carry all our camp, and pull the truck a mile a minute.
Truck no good.
One Ubardi spear kill all horses.
No kill elephant. Elephant better.
That's not a gun, Tarzan.
O'Doul was just taking your picture.
Something like these, Mr. Tarzan, if you'd like to have a look.
Cheetah like pictures.
Come, let's get loaded up.
Yes, just as soon as I get that tank fixed.
M'Hona!
Get the petrol.
Come on, boys. Get in here.
That's good stuff.
Try a nip of whiskey, Mr. Tarzan.
Whiskey bad.
Mr. Tarzan, you're the last man
I'd have taken for a temperance worker.
I'm afraid there isn't much Irish in you.
Your lad's having the time of his life with that horn, Mr. Tarzan.
Make noise like rhino.
Not so good a noise, I'll wager.
No mechanical contrivance can compete with the voice of a living creature.
O'Doul smart man.
Thank you, Mr. Tarzan.
Another compliment like that... and you'll have a smart corpse on your hands.
There's nothing like nature.
It's the natural creatures, the little birds and the beasties.
It's them that touches the cockles of your heart.
That's the drink.
That's what drink does to you.
I'll never touch another drop of drink as long as I live.
Stop pushing that horn, will you?
When do we come to the escarpment?
Have you any idea?
Pretty soon now. We'll be able to see it as soon as we get through the woods.
It reaches almost to the sky.
I suppose we'll have to leave the trucks behind us.
If we had an airplane, we could fly up there.
Too bad we didn't bring one with us.
I was gonna buy an airplane when we got to civilization.
I was gonna buy an automobile, too.
A big one, bigger than this one.
I was gonna buy everything.
Look, Tumbo, this is gold.
It buys everything in civilization.
- What's that?
- Gold.
Gold?
- Yes, sir, gold. It buys everything.
- Let me have a look at that.
Look at this.
Where did you get this?
In the river where we swim.
I see. Is there any more of it?
There's lots of it on the bottom.
Lots of it.
What do you do with it?
I use it in my sling.
They're heavier than stones.
Mother says in civilization you can buy everything with it.
I could buy an airplane with this, couldn't I?
Yes, I guess you could, son.
Have you told Mr. Elliott and Mr. O'Doul about this?
No, sir, I haven't.
You know, you shouldn't tell anyone.
In civilization, gold loses its value if you talk about it too much.
Let's keep this a secret, just between ourselves.
- Shouldn't I even tell the Professor?
- No.
Then it wouldn't be a secret.
Secrets aren't very healthy on an expedition, Medford.
Why don't we wait and discuss this point at the proper time?
Tell you what, son, you keep this a secret... we'll buy you an airplane for yourself.
- You will?
- We'll buy you two of them.
Then Tumbo can have one, too, can't he?
It's a secret. I won't tell anyone ever.
Go ahead, blow the horn if you feel like it.
Look, Tumbo, there's the escarpment.
That's where I live.
Juju.
There's no juju if Tarzan wants you there.
That's where you're gonna live, Tumbo, up there with Tarzan, Jane, and me.
Come on.
Thank you, Tarzan.
My head was spinning there for a moment.
- Escarpment high up.
- Yes, it must be the altitude.
Boy.
Darling, where have you been?
Where did you go?
I've been so worried about you.
You gonna punish me, Mother?
No, darling, not now.
But you must never go away again.
- What happened to you?
- Nothing much.
Here's Tumbo. He's my best friend.
Can't talk very well yet, though.
Happy to know you, Tumbo.
- Friends.
- Friend?
I met him just when the rhino was going to kill him.
What rhino?
Just before we came in the plague.
The plague?
Tarzan, what happened?
Who are these people?
People?
How do you do?
I'm doing better, ma'am, thanks to your charming presence.
O'Doul good little man, like Cheetah.
Now don't be comparing me with him.
If this hairy heathen resembles anybody... it's me wife's second brother
Marcus V. O'Connell.
That's the last bottle of Irish whiskey between here and Dublin.
What are these horrible things that Boy's been telling me?
Boy have good time. Little Tarzan.
- My name is Medford. Glad to know you.
- How do you do?
Tarzan's just been telling me how kind and brave you've been.
We'll never be able to repay you, so welcome to our home.
We should have been at a loss without Tarzan.
Now I am up here, I can understand why
I never could find it indicated on any map.
We like to think of it as being above and beyond maps.
Sort of a world of our own.
I'm so curious,
I must risk being impertinent.
How does such a lovely person with your obvious background and position... come to be here?
A compliment is never impertinent,
Mr. Medford.
I came here. Tarzan and I met.
I fell in love with my future husband.
So naturally I stayed.
You must be very happy here.
We are.
Why, this is Utopia.
Look at the wealth of this country, Professor.
Just standing here you can see rubber, palm oil, gum, copra.
- We have caviar, too.
- Caviar?
Yes. Mother says that's what you call fish eggs in your country.
I suppose this area's very rich in mineral deposits?
I don't really know, Mr. Medford.
It's possible, I suppose.
My husband's a mind reader.
What did he say?
He says he's sure you're very hungry because he is.
- We are hungry, too.
- Shall we go to the house?
Now then, all of you, look this way, please.
This is going to be a masterpiece.
It'll be out of the fixing bath in no time at all now.
Boy is having the time of his life.
Just think, he's never seen a photograph before.
There isn't any need for that sort of thing in this beautiful, private world you have.
I feel almost like an intruder.
But you're not.
You're a most welcome guest.
We hope you'll stay with us a long time.
There's nothing I'd like better than to spend the rest of my days here... but I'm afraid we have to push on.
We've a job ahead of us.
After you've been here a little while... you'll find those jobs aren't as important as you thought they were.
Look, everybody's lost their heads.
They're lost all right.
And you can thank this long-haired scamp here.
What's the matter, Cheetah?
You look awfully funny.
Hey, Boy.
- You want to look through the telescope?
- Yes, sir.
Here.
Here, go ahead.
Do you see the moon?
But I can't see the man in the moon now.
Where's he gone to?
There's no man in the moon.
That's an illusion.
The face you see is made up of shadows... caused by mountains and craters on the moon.
I used to like him. He looked so friendly.
Well, you have got new friends now.
Say, by the way... when are you going to show us the place where you found the gold?
You mean our secret?
Tomorrow morning. Before anybody's up.
Good. Fine.
I'm so happy Boy's getting a chance to see something of the wonders of science.
I can never thank you enough.
That's nothing. We're glad to do it.
Professor Elliott has another surprise for you.
Movies.
Movies? What's that?
Wait till you see.
O'Doul has the projection machine set up now.
Come on, Boy. You too, Tumbo.
Looks like we'll be getting up early in the morning.
All ready to start now in a minute, folks.
Sit down there and make yourselves comfortable.
Isn't it exciting?
There is speed for you, Tarzan.
That train goes at least 100 miles an hour.
Why?
- It gets you there faster.
- Why?
Well, to save time, of course.
What do with time?
I'm afraid he has you there, Vandermeer.
Look, Boy. Airplane.
Look, Tumbo, airplane.
That's what Mr. Medford's going to get us when we get the gold.
Is that all?
Now, it's way past your bedtime, Boy.
You better go to bed.
- But I'm not a bit sleepy.
- Boy, go.
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, darling.
Good night, Tarzan. Come on, Tumbo.
- Good night, Boy.
- Good night, everybody.
Boy said something about you and gold and an airplane.
Yes, Medford. What was all that about?
Nothing much.
Just that the other day Boy told me he'd discovered gold on the escarpment.
Gold up here?
Naturally, I told him what a great piece of luck it would be... and I told him about the things he could buy with gold.
Like the airplanes.
But that's such nonsense.
Little boys tell the most fantastic tales.
That's that.
I'm afraid Boy's going to be disappointed about the plane.
But, Medford, why didn't you mention this gold business before?
It was a bit hard to believe, Professor.
I wanted to wait around and dig and see if I could find the gold.
- No.
- This is any man's country up here.
- Nobody owns this part of the world.
- Tarzan's country.
This is not any man's country.
This is our home.
And we'd be very poor guests indeed... if we repaid your hospitality by doing anything to displease Tarzan or yourself.
- I know you'll agree with me on that point.
- Of course.
Jane, come.
Coming.
Good night. Sleep easily.
We leave tomorrow morning... and you and your family will have your home to yourselves again.
- Jane, come.
- Coming, darling. Thank you, Professor.
Good night.
I'm afraid the O'Douls are born to be poor to the end of their days.
This is a scientific expedition, and
I'll not permit it to turn into a gold hunt.
- Are you afraid of that savage?
- It isn't that... but I don't believe we'd have much chance against him in the jungle.
It's simply that we've been given to understand... that there is no gold to be had here and I believe it.
I want to believe it. I like Tarzan.
He's created a beautiful home in this paradise here... and I wouldn't want to see it overrun and destroyed.
I hope you gentlemen will feel the same way. Good night.
Good night, Professor.
- Thanks.
- Come on.
A little touch of vertigo that hit me.
I thought for a moment there
I'd been drinking.
- You better go to bed now.
- Yes.
You better go to bed and stay there.
- Boy.
- Tarzan, don't wake him now.
Get two airplanes, give one to Tumbo.
I hope all the excitement hasn't upset him.
We better let him sleep. You can talk to him in the morning. Come on.
You mustn't be angry with him, dear.
He realizes so little yet.
Boy good. People bad.
And we mustn't blame them for wanting gold.
In the outside world, gold means as much to them... as the strength in your arms means to you.
People... fools.
Not all of them.
But none of them have what we have.
Tarzan have Jane.
They'll be gone tomorrow, and we'll be alone again.
Wonderfully alone as we've always been.
Has it seemed a long time, Tarzan?
Sun make one safari for Jane and Tarzan.
A poet couldn't have said that more beautifully.
Come.
My, the water's beautiful tonight.
Not water. Jane.
As nice little Mr. O'Doul would say,
"'Tis blarney you're giving me."
Blarney?
Well, we call it love, darling.
Do you remember when we first used to swim here?
Tarzan remember.
To think that I was ever frightened of you.
You know, Tarzan, when a man meets a young lady in the outside world...
he doesn't dare behave not one bit like you did.
What man do?
Well, they shake hands.
That is, if she offers him her hand.
Then he bows from the hips, and asks permission to call.
And then if she's of age... he takes her to some parties or theater or somewhere to dine.
And then if he decides he wants her for his wife... he goes to see her father.
Why? What do with father?
To ask his permission to marry his daughter.
Why?
That's the way it's done. Politely.
With etiquette.
Too much talk. Tarzan way better.
Yes. It is better.
Remember? Tarzan, big hand...
Jane, little hand?
- The last one, Mr. Medford.
- You sure?
Yes, sir. I hunted all over the bottom.
There's no more.
- It's not much, is it?
- Is it enough to buy an airplane?
There must be more.
Tarzan knows where there's a whole mountain of it.
He knows where it is?
- That's what he said.
- I knew there must be more of it.
This isn't river gold.
It came from a vein of almost solid metal.
We've been waiting breakfast for you.
What have you been doing?
We were sure you were wrong about there not being any gold here.
Look at these. Boy brought them up from the bed of the river.
Men say they go last night.
Now, let's be friends and talk this over.
Boy told us you know where there's a mountain full of gold.
- Go!
- Please, madam, let's be sensible.
We'll handle the entire operations... and there will be great wealth for all of us.
You can be the richest woman in the world.
I've no wish to be.
I told you last night, this is our home.
We don't want it disturbed.
I was hoping you'd understand.
Suppose we don't choose to recognize that you and he have any right...
Tarzan say go.
Now, wait a minute...
Jane, Boy, home.
Men go.
That man is a madman, Professor.
- There is gold here. Just as the boy said.
- I see.
There's every indication it's a very rich vein.
Safari go.
I'm sorry, Tarzan, I didn't know this or it wouldn't have happened.
We'd be ready to start now if O'Doul hadn't suddenly been taken ill.
He's very sick at the moment.
We'll leave immediately he's well.
- Little man sick?
- Touch of fever.
- Where?
- There.
Ubardi plague. Tarzan cure.
Is Mr. Tarzan gone?
Yes, but he'll be back soon,
I'm pretty sure.
Then I want to tell you something about him.
- I was back in old Dublin just now.
- Take it easy.
I was departing here, Professor.
I'm certain I was.
And then Mr. Tarzan walked in...
I stopped, I couldn't go on.
He put his hand on me head...
and it yanked me back to life as sudden as a rope around me body.
It's hard to die... when Mr. Tarzan is around.
Would you kindly give me a sip of cool water?
That's where I was, back in old Dublin.
Medicine cure.
- Better soon.
- Thank you.
It's a fine Christian you are, Mr. Tarzan.
He's terribly sick, Tarzan.
He collapsed on his way back from the river.
Ubardi plague.
Tarzan get medicine. Tarzan cure.
I'm afraid, I'm terribly afraid.
Tarzan cure.
We should never have allowed him out in the jungle by himself.
It's all my fault.
He's dying.
Tarzan get medicine.
Boy better soon.
Your fever's broken, Dennis.
Now you won't need any more medicine for a while.
I'm glad you've come, gentlemen.
O'Doul is getting better.
Tarzan's medicine did the trick.
What's the matter with you, Professor?
You don't look so good to me.
I'm all right.
Just a little rocky at the moment.
We'll break camp first thing tomorrow morning.
O'Doul will be able to travel then.
We've no intention of leaving the escarpment, Professor.
Not for a while, anyway.
You're still members of this expedition... and I'm still in charge.
We are not interested in your expedition anymore.
I see.
So that's what the guns are all about.
And you're the gentlemen who look upon
Tarzan as some sort of barbarian.
I'm sure of one thing.
I'm sure he'll know how to deal with you.
Allow me.
I'm sorry.
Perhaps this is a piece of luck.
Anyway, it's worth trying. Come on.
Mr. Elliott is down with fever himself.
I've had a little medical experience.
I thought I might be able to help.
Boy is so sick, I don't know what to do.
Yes, he's a very sick boy.
- What have you done for him?
- Tarzan gave him his medicine.
It's hard to tell about these so-called natural remedies.
- O'Doul is worse.
- You mean the medicine didn't help him?
No, madam, he's much worse now.
Tarzan say go.
But, Tarzan, they came here to help us.
Medicine cure. Boy better soon.
If I could be just sure.
We have some medicine that might help.
Sulfamyradol.
It's a new drug that works wonders in cases such as this.
- Elliott's already sent a runner for some.
- Where?
We foolishly enough left it in the truck at the foot of the escarpment.
- The runner will be back in a day or two.
- A day or two... may be too late.
Tarzan will go.
He travels swiftly.
He'd be back by morning.
- That's a good idea.
- Yes, it is a good idea.
- No.
- But, Tarzan, you have to go.
Tarzan's medicine cure.
Tarzan, we can't leave anything undone.
Oh, darling,
I have great faith in you always.
But if anything happened to Boy, we'd never forgive ourselves.
Darling, if you love me... if you love Boy, you've got to go.
Tarzan go.
The native guards at the truck will give it to you.
It's in a special medical kit in a white tin box.
Hurry, Tarzan.
Tarzan get kit.
All right, O'Doul.
If you're finished there, you better get moving. We're leaving tonight.
Tonight? But we can't leave the sick lad here.
He's all right. His fever's broken.
We're going over to see him now.
Be sure M'Hona has the boys ready to leave when Vandermeer gets back.
- Are you not coming with us?
- No, I'm staying... to wait for Tarzan.
Never mind any more questions, O'Doul.
I'm in charge now. Get going.
They're all right. They're fine.
You were right about that medicine.
It cured the little fellow, just like that. Marvelous medicine.
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about, Tarzan.
It won't do any good to kill me.
You'd better quiet down or you'll never see your family again.
Where Elliott?
He's gone. The fever got him.
Tarzan understand.
But your family is all right.
They're over with Vandermeer.
Now, listen, Tarzan... here's the idea, if only you'll let me explain it.
If you show me where that gold comes from...
you can have your family back safe and sound.
The sooner you show me the gold, the sooner you'll have them back.
How Tarzan know?
Gold's all we want.
That shouldn't be difficult to understand.
Go!
Where Jane? Where Boy?
You know the little lake near the cut at the end of the chasm?
- Tarzan know.
- They're over there with Vandermeer.
There's no sign of him.
I think I've finished him.
Tarzan juju man, bwana.
He'll need plenty of juju if he's broken his neck... or if one of those slugs caught up with him.
Hey, Vandermeer.
You are a wealthy man, my friend.
- Did he show it to you?
- It's enormous.
A second Johannesburg.
Mr. Medford, where is Tarzan?
Your husband's behaving rationally for a change.
He's meeting us by the trucks at the base of the escarpment.
- I don't believe you.
- Why not?
Tarzan understands quite clearly... that the only way I can be sure of his allowing us to leave safely... is by keeping you with us until we do.
You see, I respect your husband.
And I'm making certain that he respects me.
Tarzan would never agree to that.
You're keeping something back.
I'm going to him.
Perhaps I better guard these heathens.
There's no need for that, O'Doul.
I never thought that you, too, would...
Tarzan will twist your head off for this and feed it to hyenas.
What savage sentiment.
This is the only way we can deal with a man... who swings through the trees without trousers...
and tries to block the progress of civilization.
Now, as your partner...
We're not interested in your opinions.
Tell the boys to get packed.
We leave at once.
Certainly, gentlemen.
What really happened to Tarzan?
- I had to dispose of him.
- I didn't count on murder, Medford.
It was he or I. The beast attacked me.
But if he is dead, what do you want her and the boy for?
There's just a chance I didn't finish him.
Fell in a ravine, out of sight.
We better hold them, just in case.
In any event, we've got to get out of here, fast.
Get organized, come back with machinery and equipment.
What's a short route out of here?
This is new country to me.
We'll have to go back the way we came.
It'll take us eight weeks to get back to Nairobi.
Ask him if he knows a quicker way.
There is a shortcut along the river.
But then we have to cross the country of the Jaconi.
- We'll take it.
- Now, wait a moment.
Jaconi are the most dangerous tribe in Africa.
We would be much better off...
He says the porters won't go that way.
They are afraid of the Jaconi.
- He says they are water devils.
- Never mind what he says.
Tell them to get going.
We'll pay €5 bonuses.
Hop to it. Let's be off.
I'm going, Mother. I'm going to get Tarzan.
- No, Boy. You mustn't.
- I must. Don't worry, please.
I want no help from you, Mr. O'Doul.
Well spoken, ma'am.
If your spirits are up, you'll never be down.
This isn't the way back to your trucks.
It's our way.
Where are you taking us?
Where's Tarzan?
What did you do to Tarzan?
If you don't keep quiet,
I'll have you bound and carried.
Boy, no.
Jaconis. War drums.
M'Hona, tell those boys to keep up.
They refuse to go any farther.
This way, we can keep an eye on them.
This is no good. We better get back.
You're a little too late.
We are surrounded by now.
Why don't we make a stab for it and fight them off?
Our only chance is to make the river.
He's right.
The Jaconis want to capture us alive.
They kill white people very slowly.
Look. Mr. O'Doul.
He's probably better off. Come. M'Hona!
Yeah, come on.
Make a run for it, sonny. I can't move.
The angels and the saints preserve me...
and the pickaninny here, keep an eye on him, too.
All right, you big bully.
I'll take no more of your insults and intimidations.
All right, now, enough is enough.
Come out here, you coward.
Come out here, and I'll give you the thrashing of your miserable life.
That arrow couldn't have come from more than 10 feet away.
- Stop wasting your bullets.
- I thought I saw something moving.
Get a hold of yourself.
Stop.
Tell them anybody who tries it again gets the same.
I can't stand any more.
Why don't they take me and get it over with?
No such luck. They're saving us.
They'll take us down the river tomorrow to the village.
What do those drums say?
I don't know, but I can assure you it is not to our benefit.
That's a bad spot for Mr. Tarzan to be in.
What did you say, Mr. Tarzan?
Get vine. Tarzan catch.
Grab a hold of that and pull it back.
That's something like it, me bucko.
Pull! Pull it, Timba.
Come on, Samson, we'll give this thing another try.
Suffering snakes! He made it.
Better hurry up, Mr. Tarzan.
Them scoundrels have got hold of Mrs. Tarzan and the youngster.
They're heading for the Jaconi country.
I'm coming, Mr. Tarzan.
I'm on the way.
You may be a monster to the local inhabitants... but you're just another lizard to O'Doul.
Timba will take you over the mountains.
From there on, the way is easy.
What on earth might this be?
It is a large and ponderous fruit, so it is.
It's a bon voyage basket.
- Jungle-style.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Here's something to keep the sun off your head.
Thank you, son.
We're going to miss you.
Tarzan find friend.
It's me that's found a friend, and the best.
If there were more folks like you in the world... it would be a sweet and a smiling place.
I'll never forget you.
Goodbye, heaven bless you.
- Goodbye, Mr. O'Doul.
- Goodbye, good luck always.
Wouldn't you like to see Mr. O'Doul 's face when he finds the melon's full of gold?
O'Doul laugh, then cry.
He'll be rich, won't he?
And he'll never tell where his riches came from.
You can be sure of that.
Tarzan sure.
Friend.
Where is our navy?
Three months have passed
since the tragedy
at Pearl Harbor...
1 2 die as Jap submarines
strike near San Francisco.
Committee demands probe
of navy failure to fight.
Where is our navy?
Why doesn't it fight?
We cannot answer that question.
We must force ourselves not to listen to it.
We do not intend to tell theJapanese how badly our navy was damaged at Pearl Harbor.
Since December the 7 th, our prewar strategy is useless.
The defense of the Aleutians and our Pacific Coast with the Hawaiis at the apex of the Triangle is almost impossible with what remains of our navy.
But we are not considering a defensive campaign.
You all realize
I'm indulging in no false heroics when I say our only hope of evading destruction is to destroy the enemy.
TheJapanese have won a quick and staggering succession of victories.
They're aiming now at the final knockout-- the capture of Pearl Harbor.
To accomplish this, they must first take Midway.
If they are permitted to choose the time and conditions of attack, we haven't much of a chance, but if we can trick them into meeting us when they think we are weak, we then have a chance of cutting their navy down to our size and proceeding with the rest of the Pacific strategy.
We have learned there are heavy concentrations of enemy carriers and other fleet units in the Marshall Islands and a numerous transport force making up at Truk.
So our strategy is this.
We shall concentrate our strength near Midway in our effort to spring a trap.
One of our carriers is already at sea waiting to carry out the initial phases of this strategy.
On April the 28th, this carrier and its escort will be off the Marshall Islands, close enough to be detected.
On May the 3rd, it is to be seen near the Gilbert Islands by theJapanese.
On May the 8th, it will be detected near Ocean Island, as if heading for theJap fleet at Truk, but it will not attack.
It will turn south, be seen on May the 1 5th at Guadalcanal.
Every time one of our pilots encounters a Jap plane, he will return to the carrier, as if he did not stomach a fight.
By sending this one carrier on such a mission, we hope to convince the enemy that our fleet is scattered, our fighting morale... shattered.
Actually, we shall be waiting for them in force near Midway.
If they fall for this bait and attempt an invasion, we shall then be able to answer the question--
''Where is our navy?
Why doesn't it fight?''
Pilot to crew.
There's mama.
I see her, Commander.
Pilot to crew.
If you need a toothpick,
I know where you can find one.
We'd only need half that space, Mr. Scott.
Just lower your wheels and drop your hook, like putting a baby to bed.
Set condition one
in the air department.
Stand by
to land planes.
Stand by
to land planes.
Torpedo planes sighted broad on the port quarter.
Altitude 2-5-0-0.
Range 8,000 yards.
Stand by for practice run.
If those were only meatballs instead ofTBFs.
O.K. Hook.
Stand clear.
I'm O'Donnell, commanding Bomber Six.
Welcome aboard.
Molton, commanding
Torpedo Five.
What's the scuttlebutt?
What gives?
I thought we'd find out when we got aboard.
Not from us.
I thought with you guys aboard, we'd have some action.
Name's Shubert.
I'm Manning.
We're on a cook's tour.
Your guess is as good as mine.
See you around.
Sir.
Lieutenant Commander
Edward Molton reporting for
Torpedo Squadron Five.
Glad to have you aboard.
Molton, Commander Harper, our air officer.
How do you do?
Good to see you.
I've a message for you.
Hey, what's eating Oscar?
Sure making a long approach.
He's building up an entrance.
Just feel your way in, sir. Lightly.
And politely.
Do we have to shoot him down?
What does he want, a spotlight?
He's coming in too fast.
Can't he see that wave-off?
[Siren Sounds]
Assemble your squadron in the ready room.
Aye, aye, sir.
Boy, I thought for a while there... until 1 900...
I thought I'd have to turn back.
Maybe you should have.
Didn't you see the wave-off?
Yes, sir.
Did you think the flagman was waving bye-bye?
To tell you the truth,
I couldn't think.
I had my hands too full of airplane at the time.
Oh.
But--
Oh, men, this is our air officer
Commander Harper.
Commander Harper, this is Mr. Brainard,
Mr. Chisholm.
Mr. Markham.
How do you do?
Mr.Jacobson.
How do you do?
Mr. White.
Sir.
Mr. Holloway.
Mr. Scott.
How do you do?
I'm glad to know you and welcome you aboard.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
You've been assigned to quarters which I hope you find to your liking.
We have some pretty good men on board.
I've been very proud of all of our squadrons-- torpedoes, bombers, and fighters.
I hope you equal their record.
Read that, please,
Mr. Molton.
Aloud.
'' Memorandum for commander,
Air Group Five.
Subject--
Report of casualty which occurred during maneuvers,
September 1 9, 1 941 .
Roy K. Spangler, number 43 281 1 2, aviation machinist's mate, first class,
United States Navy, died at 1 600 while under anesthesia for surgery following accident on flight deck.
Spangler's next of kin, his mother
Mrs. Edward R. Spangler,
361 7 Lee Avenue,
Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Signed J.B. Golden, commander, senior medical officer.''
A hot pilot ignored a wave-off.
Spangler couldn't get out of the way.
The prop cut him nearly in half.
I'm sorry, sir.
So was the other pilot.
So was
Spangler's mother.
I'd like to explain, sir--
I don't like explanations.
Secure.
Sorry, sir.
The way you and the others had to take it on account of me.
Just don't ignore any more wave-offs.
Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Scott.
Here's some mail for you.
Oh, thanks.
I see the movie fans haven't forgotten you, sir.
Cunningham?
Yes, sir.
I've received this letter from the admiral.
I thought you'd like to read it.
Congratulations.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!
I give you
Cookie Cunningham!
The man who studied
Japanese mathematics and found you always get the right answer by subtracting zero.
Who says we don't know where we're going?
I tell you what
I'm going to do.
I'll fly my TBF clear to Tokyo.
I'll drag that little monkey to 1 5,000 and drop him like a bomb, right smack on Fujiyama.
I can't stand the canned vegetables you get on shipboard.
But our squadron's different.
We'll have fresh vegetables.
How come?
How?
You going to plow up the flight deck?
No, I'm not kidding.
We'll have some fresh celery, real juicy tomatoes, green onions--
What are you going to use for dirt?
Water and chemicals.
That's the agriculture of the future.
Ya-hoo!
Hey, fellows!
Look!
Get a load of this!
Wait a minute!
Hey, wait!
Now don't do that.
You did it!
It shows it right there.
You kissed Betty Grable.
If I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.
Did you ever kiss Garbo?
I've never seen her.
When you're in a picture and you have to kiss Betty Grable--
Listen to me--
have to--
When you kiss her, what's it feel like?
Ah, let it lay.
I'm serious about this, Oscar.
I really mean it.
I mean, do you feel anything at all, or is it all just part of the day's work?
Does she breathe deep?
Does she kiss you or you her?
Does she kiss back?
What I want to know is, how does it make you feel?
The rest of us can only dream about those girls, but you've actually kissed them.
What's it like?
Well, it's, uh... it's like nothing else in this world.
- Ahh.
- Ahh.
I'll never forget that first girl
I kissed in a picture.
Who was it?
Yeah. Who?
You think
I'd kiss and tell?
In a wardroom?
Come on, Oscar.
Well, it's, um...
The night before the scene was to be shot,
I didn't sleep.
I lay awake all night, just daydreaming about that kiss.
How do you daydream at night?
Quiet.
Well, how do you?
The next morning
I got to the studio an hour earlier, got into my wardrobe, dashed over to the set.
I waited all day for that one moment when I'd get to kiss her.
Finally, it was time for the scene to be shot.
We took our places.
She was wearing the most beautiful black negligee.
Lovely... revealing.
Her hair was swept back from her forehead.
Her eyes were partly closed.
I took her into my arms...
Go on.
Kiss her, you dope!
The hairdresser yelled,
''You're mussing up her hairdo.''
The director screamed, '' Move your arm.
You're tilting her collar.''
The cameraman said,
''I can't see her nose.''
So I kissed her off-center and smacked the air.
If you want to kiss a girl right, you got to join the navy.
Hey! You can't get away with that!
Hey! Hey! Gather 'round.
I want to tell you something.
Your worries are over.
Listen to the voice of Superman.
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.
I'll fly my TBF
clear to Tokyo.
Throw a rope
around Tojo's neck,
like I roped coyotes
back in Texas.
I'll drag that
monkey to 1 5,000 feet
and drop him
like a bomb...
Very funny.
I wouldn't want to bore you guys with what I'm really going to do.
It sure takes a load off our minds.
That guy there might possibly give you a few pointers.
He's only shot down three Zeros.
I'm just a bag of wind from Texas.
I must sound funny to a guy who's done the things you've done.
How do you feel when those meatballs come at you?
I didn't see them until they were pretty close.
Did they attack from above?
From below.
They missed with their first pass.
They say they can attack, pull out, and dive again before you see them.
Slow but with maneuverability?
I don't know, really--
They machine-gun you on the way down?
I'm writing my memoirs for the Saturday Evening Post.
You can read them after the war.
All right.
Break it up.
Let's cut a record.
Hey, you want me to make another one?
I could knock that moon out of the sky.
Leave it alone.
I'll need that moon when I get home.
Right on the beam, kid.
What's your name?
Benjamin K. O'Neal, sir.
Aviation radioman, first class.
Did you come in with Torpedo Five?
That's right, sir.
Haven't you served under me before?
I was in and out of Pensacola, sir.
I thought I'd seen you before.
As you were.
Bring back
Bring back my Bonny to me
To me...
What's wrong, Benny?
I've been ducking him since I came on board.
If he figures how long ago he saw me, he'll ground me sure.
How come?
Too old for air combat duty.
Are you kidding?
There's no law--
That man's the whole navy in one pair of pants.
Do you know what kind of guy he is?
He's the only officer whose men wouldn't give him a nickname.
What's the matter?
What if he finds out about me?
What about you?
Benny, how old would you take me to be?
Oh, I'd say about 20, 21 .
Thanks.
But if he ever sees my birth certificate,
I'm cooked.
When I joined the navy,
I made a mistake about my age.
You mean you weren't 1 7?
I won't be 1 7 for 3 months.
So that's the way it is.
We're either too old or young.
Well, kid, we're in this together.
Every tear
Will be a memory
So wait and pray
Each night for me
Till we meet again
[Ding Ding]
[Ding Ding]
Well, gentlemen... we have our orders.
[Plays Reveille]
Do it again.
I love it.
Come on, Scott.
30 minutes to flight quarters.
O.K., O.K.
Come on.
Come on.
No wonder they gave you the Navy Cross.
Waking people up at night, you have to be a hero.
Your squadron ahead of ours?
I'm not flying right now.
Just shower call and such.
I was on the sick list after Pearl Harbor.
Still wobbly on the pins.
Wake Chisholm, will you?
Yeah.
Good morning.
I'll need five empty fuel containers, some potassium nitrate, some calcium nitrate, manganese sulfate--
Mananganese what, sir?
Manganese sulfate, and about 30 feet of wire mesh.
And get lots of excelsior from the engine packings, and, um... a big ball of heavy string.
Yeah.
Very good, sir.
May I ask what all these things are for, sir?
Tomatoes.
Oh, tomatoes.
When you return from your search, you will notice the carrier will be towing a sled.
It's more like a spar about the size of a telephone pole.
As each plane comes in, it will make one pass, dropping its bomb well astern of the sled.
Don't hit it. We don't want the flight deck showered with bomb fragments.
Every hour we continue on our present course brings nearer the possibility of contact with enemy aircraft.
Your orders are these.
When enemy planes are encountered...
do not engage them.
Return to the carrier at once.
By '' Do not engage,'' you mean--
I mean avoid all contact with them.
But, sir, that's running away.
Any other questions?
But suppose the enemy attacks us, sir?
May we interpret the orders--
You will not interpret the orders.
You will obey them.
Pilots,
man your planes.
Pilots,
man your planes.
That's all.
Let's go.
Pilot to Radioman.
You got the dope on the radio frequencies?
Radioman to Pilot.
Yes, sir.
Frequency 69-7 0.
Secondary 61 -50.
All set, sir.
Pilot to Gunner.
Gunner to Pilot.
All set, sir.
Maybe I'll get my first meatball today.
If you see anyJaps, blow them a kiss.
But don't shoot-- that's an order.
Pilots... stand by to start engines.
Stand clear propellers.
Start engines.
[Engine Starts]
Oh, boy!
I ought to pop you on the chin.
That's how Billy Tom knocked me out.
I was born with a glass jaw, but otherwise, in the torso,
I'm unvulnerable.
Come on.
Hit me.
Infinitestimal fortitude.
That's what I calls it.
Rock of Gibraltar.
Hold everything.
What you got there?
Oh, isn't she lovely?
[Wolf Whistles]
Look at that!
Wow!
A love note.
Come on, read it.
Get out.
Come on.
'' Dearest Hallam,
I couldn't sleep thinking how lucky the girl was in your picture
I saw last night and thinking how wonderful it would be if I could have been her and feel your strong arms around me... and your lips pressed close to mine.''
- Wait a minute!
- Hey!
Hey, get a load of this, fellas.
'' Dear hunk of man,
I'm a hep chick who thinks you're a solid piece of what it takes.''
Potassium phosphate, potassium nitrate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium nitrate.
O.K.
What are you going to use these for?
Shh.
Tomatoes.
Tomatoes.
Tomatoes?
Yeah.
I'm glad you dropped in,
Mr. Cunningham.
I wanted to congratulate you on your citation.
Thank you very much,
Commander.
[Whistling My Bonny
Lies Over The Ocean]
Sir, the medical officer says
I'm completely O.K. again, in every respect.
That's great.
You agree with the M.O.?
Yes, sir. I'd like reassignment to flight duty as soon as possible.
All right, Cunningham.
As soon as possible.
Thank you, sir.
O.K.
Torpedo Squadron Five returning from search, sir.
Mmm.
Nice kid, that Cunningham.
Yes, sir.
The stars at night
Are big and bright
[Fires Four Times]
Deep in the heart ofTexas
The prairie sky
Is wide and high
[Fires Four Times]
Deep in the heart ofTexas
What are you shooting at,
Mr. Scott?
Well, nothing.
I'm just testing my guns.
Oh.
All personnel, clear the afterdeck during bombing practice.
All personnel, clear the afterdeck during bombing practice.
200 yards astern of the sled.
1 0 yards to starboard.
Foley, watch that sled.
Hear this!
All flight deck personnel form line aport ship.
Clear deck of bomb fragments.
[Whistle]
Lieutenant Commander Molton,
report to Air Plot.
Lieutenant Commander Molton,
report to Air Plot.
Landing against wave-offs, blowing up the sled.
Are you trying to kill half the men here?
I'll talk with him, sir.
I want that man grounded.
Take that whole squadron in hand, or I will.
Is that clear?
Quite clear, sir.
That's all.
[Laughing]
Got a match, Paducah?
Oh, yeah.
You've gotten off to a bad start on this carrier.
There was very little excuse for you, Scott, and none at all for you today, Brainard.
Hitting that sled wasn't just carelessness.
No, sir. I wanted to see if I could hit something.
You will.
You're going to hit the deck.
You're grounded.
Grounded, sir?
Report to the squadron duty officer as his assistant until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Secure.
[Whistle]
Attention, all hands.
Movies for tonight...
Alice Faye and Betty Grable
in Tin Pan Alley.
The way this navy operates, we'll be expected to take one look at their gams and run.
Oh, uh, Cunningham,
I talked to your commanding officer.
You go up tomorrow.
Thank you, sir.
That's all.
Be sure the plants get plenty of sun, and keep this excelsior moist.
The chemicals in the water will do the rest.
In a few weeks we'll have some nice, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, celery, onions.
Yes, sir.
Arnie Devlin was flying my wing.
Arnie Devlin was flying my wing.
He got the first Zero.
The others dove past, came up under my tail.
I got one. Then two more came head on.
I couldn't escape them, so I fired on them.
One exploded-- the other fell in flames.
Do they bust up when they're hit?
They fall apart.
There's so much magnesium, they just can't take it.
Here's where you made the mistake.
This type of cruiser has three stacks.
There's a slight wrinkle, very little superstructure amidship.
It didn't show on the quarterdecks.
I see it now.
Look how widely-spaced they are.
Very little superstructure.
Have you noticed?
How about a little acey-deucy?
Sure.
It goes through this little gadget.
That's the sound exciter.
Please.
We won't get anywhere this way.
Will we?
Go away.
Go away. Go.
Come on, you boot camp fanatics.
We want to see
Betty Grable.
Uh-uh.
Is there something wrong?
You're diving at 1 5,000 feet-- angle, 45-degree, air speed 380, and you release a 1 ,000-pound bomb at 2,000 feet.
I've got to figure the effect of gravity and air resistance.
Gravity's got nothing to do with the forward motion of a projectile.
Say, you're right.
I've been right for 3 5 years.
'' Dearest lover boy, how I wish we could meet in person.
We could have some swell times together.''
What are you doing?
Come on, give me.
A welterweight.
I can train down, can't I?
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
A doll.
There!
Let's see the picture now.
Shall we?
Yeah, let's see it.
Come on.
All right, all right.
Pipe down.
Whoopsie-daisy.
He's the sheik of Araby
His faithful wives
are we
But life
is such a ball--
[Whistling And Jeering]
The film broke.
We can't help that, can we?
[Whistling And Jeering]
Go back to boot camp!
Stand by for emergency signal.
Stand by for emergency signal.
Come on now, men.
Patience, patience!
I'm ready.
Aw, look at that.
It's upside down!
Notify the escort we're changing course.
0-3-4 true.
Speed 22 knots.
Signal Bridge.
Send the following message--
Course 0-3-4 true.
Speed 22 knots.
[Chanting And Jeering]
You want to see this, or don't you?
Yeah, go on!
All right.
[Bell Rings
And Reveille Plays]
All hands.
Man your battle stations.
[Bell Rings]
[Whistle]
All hands.
Man your battle stations.
All hands.
Man your battle stations.
I guess this is it, sir.
This is it.
Torpedo Five ready room.
Is that you, Brainard?
Yeah, Red.
All pilots present.
[Explosions]
Hey, do you hear that?
[Explosions]
I heard it, and I felt it, too.
[Explosions]
Our escort must be dropping depth charges.
Hey, Red.
Give us the lowdown, will you?
Looks like
we've hit the jackpot.
We've picked up a submarine
and some night snoopers.
Submarines and planes.
Must be a wholeJap task force out there.
Why don't they brief us?
Ready.
We're getting the dope now.
Sir, message from Signal Bridge.
Escort reports submarine no longer detected on sound screen.
C.V. to Escort.
Resume formation.
C.V. to Escort.
Resume formation.
They're turning around.
Aren't we going to flight?
Are you kidding?
What kind of war is this?
We can't shootJaps.
Now we're running away.
That's enough.
Good night.
Commander Harper.
Operations for tomorrow.
Six TBFs on intermediate patrol, four hours.
Takeoff 0600.
Six SB2Cs.
1 50-mile search.
Takeoff 0600.
Speed up, flight 31 .
[Siren]
Right full rudder.
Stop all engines.
Left full rudder!
Notify escort to pick up survivors.
Continue launching planes.
Start that second fugle line.
Tough break.
Too bad, Cook.
Ensign Cunningham
wanted in Air Plot.
Ensign Cunningham
wanted in Air Plot.
Probably Harper.
They get tougher.
What was the matter?
Engine?
No, sir. Me.
I'm sorry about the plane, sir.
That can't be helped, but we won't take any more chances.
For now, you'll serve better at a shore base.
Sir, this may sound funny, but I'm sure I'm O.K.
The shock of the crash was just what I needed.
If you'll give me one more--
We can't take any more chances.
That's all.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Scott.
Zeros at 5 o'clock.
Hold your fire.
Remember orders.
[Machine Gun Fire]
[Machine Gun Fire]
The last thing I saw was theJaps diving to strafe Gus after his plane hit the water.
He didn't have a ghost of a chance.
When they dived at him, each of the three planes opened up with everything they had.
Gus' plane was still burning.
I could see the flames.
Never mind that.
Let's get back to theJap planes.
Did you see anything which might have indicated the presence of an enemy task force?
I'm afraid
I wasn't watching.
What was your approximate position?
In my area of search, it was possibly
1 50 miles southeast.
Possibly?
I'm pretty sure.
I got out of there as fast as I could, according to orders.
Are you sure there were only three enemy planes?
Could there have been more?
How can I tell you what I didn't see?
I saw the three of them make a pass at Gus' plane, coming down out of the sun.
You're not certain they were Zeros?
Did you notice the shape of their wings or whether they had single or multiple engines?
I can't remember exactly, sir.
Oh, come on now, Scott.
Pull yourself together.
Yes, sir.
I'm trying to tell you, sir, that this oneJap, the first, came in and made his pass under Gus' tail, then rolled over on his back and began to shoot.
Gus' engine began to smoke, and the plane went into a dive.
Scott, from what direction did the enemy planes approach?
I told you, from out of the sun.
That can mean anything.
Sorry. That's the best
I can tell you.
What was your altitude?
I think it was about 2,500.
What was theJaps' altitude?
I don't know, sir.
They were diving when I saw them.
If only I could have gone back to help Gus.
Look, Scott... let's forget about Chisholm.
You understand that?
Very well, sir.
I'll try.
[Knock On Door]
Come in.
Sir, a destroyer is coming alongside.
All right.
We'll go on with this later.
Yes, sir.
Is that all, sir?
That's all.
[Brakes Squeal]
[Alarm Sounds]
Now hear this.
The smoking lamp is out
throughout the ship.
The smoking lamp is out
throughout the ship.
Hey, Paducah, the smoking lamp.
I heard it. I heard it.
Do you think I'm deaf?
[Chattanooga Choo-Choo Plays]
Is that the best you can do?
Yeah. That's the best I can do.
I'm no hero.
I haven't got any citation from the admiral.
I haven't shot down any Zero.
Look here, Scott.
I'm sorry.
Well, then, shut up.
Wait a minute, you two.
Take it easy.
What is this?
Sorry. I guess we're all a little jumpy.
Relax. As for you, Scott, there are no stars here.
This isn't Hollywood.
When it's time for you to take your bows, we'll turn on the spotlights.
Now you're just a part of a team, and you'll play as the team plays. Understood?
Yes, sir.
[Chattanooga Choo-Choo
Plays Loudly]
[Blows Whistle]
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
The captain will address the personnel of the ship.
Men, ever since
Pearl Harbor, our country has been asking,
''Where is our navy?
Why don't they fight?''
Because of our
unorthodox maneuvers,
I know you've been
asking the same question.
I must confess,
so have I.
We've suffered many
casualties, dead and wounded.
We've been humiliated.
We've had to avoid combat
and run away from the enemy
when we've been aching
to knock them
clean out of the sky.
We asked ourselves why
we're not permitted to fight,
why we could not
avenge our dead,
strike back in our defense.
Five minutes ago,
I received a message which
answers all our questions.
After Pearl Harbor,
our country was faced
with its greatest disaster.
The situation
was desperate,
and only a desperate and
brilliant strategy could save us.
Our navy pinned its hope
on one thing--
theJapanese inability
to deviate from a plan
once it had been made.
We knew their next move was
to capture Pearl Harbor,
but first they'd
have to take Midway.
We deceived theJaps
by making them think we'd
scattered over the ocean,
that Midway
would be a pushover.
In the meanwhile,
we secretly concentrated
our entire naval strength
at Midway.
That was our trap.
You men, this carrier,
and her escort
were the bait
to that trap.
It was a nasty job.
It has cost us heavily
in men and equipment.
TheJaps thought they saw four of our carriers at widely separated places.
They only saw one.
That was us.
Three times Tokyo reported us sunk.
Twice, we nearly were, but we're still afloat.
I'm happy to tell you
the strategy has worked.
The trap has been sprung.
Believing us scattered
over the ocean,
the mainJap fleet
is headed for Midway.
They're going in
for the kill. So are we.
We're through
running away.
We're through
pulling punches.
Our mission
is accomplished,
and from here on in,
we fight.
- Yay!
- Yay!
TheJap fleet is headed for Midway in three columns.
One is here with the carrier Soyu.
One is here with the carrier Kaga.
One is with the carrier Hiru.
Now, their rear is protected by a formation headed by the cruisers
Mikuma and Mogami.
Our heavy ships are hopelessly outnumbered.
TheJap fleet mustn't be allowed to get within range of them.
The battle of Midway must be won in the air by this carrier's planes, two that will join us, and the fortresses on Midway.
When theJaps find out what they've run into, they're going to come after you with everything they've got, but this is the battle we've been praying for.
We've got it-- on our own grounds, on our own terms.
Good luck.
Pilots...
stand by
to start engines.
Stand clear propellers.
Start engines.
B.G., all set?
Ready, sir.
O'Neal, got your recognition code straight?
Yes, sir.
One for this morning and one for this afternoon.
We'll celebrate tonight with a nice, fresh vegetable salad.
The first from my seagoing farm.
Sir, last enemy position, bearing 2-1 -5 true,
1 50 miles.
Molton to Squadron, there's our target.
Molton to Squadron, remember, when you think you're in close, go in closer before you drop that fish.
Molton to Squadron, join up.
Come on,join up.
Jacobson, rendezvous,
join up.
I can't.
There's a Zero on your tail.
There's one on yours, too.
Join up.
You all right, Hale?
Yeah, Mr. Molton.
Relay this throughout the ship.
Radio Room?
Relay these messages throughout the ship.
Wassum's out
like a flower.
Stand by for anything.
There ought to be fighters.
Watch that Zero
up there.
He won't budge.
He's an old-timer.
What's that Zero
doing, Hank?
He ain't saying.
Just hanging there.
They'll
make a pass soon.
They tagging
our outfit?
Are you kidding?
Shut up. Never mind
the crystal ball gazing.
Come on,you--
Shut up!
1 2 o'clock! Something coming
through the formation.
Wait till they come in.
Where's our fighters?
Watch the ponies
up there.
All right,
all right.
[Gunfire]
Criminy! There's
another batch coming!
All right,
I've got him!
You take him,Joe!
Two more at 2 o'clock
over your right wing.
Get him!
[Gunfire]
Got him.
Shut up.
Everybody all right?
Pilot to--
1 1 o'clock!
Cri-ola.
Ya-hoo!
Shut up, will you--
1 1 o'clock!
They're
rolling under.
I got it.
Key-ristmas!
How many are there?
Smack 'em down!
Let 'em
come around!
All right, all right.
Swing us around.
Got him! Got him!
1 1 o'clock!
Ed! Ed!
[Gunfire]
They got Ed.
No, I'm all right.
Ed, is that you?
Yeah.
They got Hank.
Gosh, there they go.
There's one chute.
Two to go.
He's rolling over.
Come on, guys.
Get out of there.
Bail out of there.
Why don't they
get out?
Jeepers,
he's really spinning.
Come on,you guys.
Get out. Get out!
There's one more out--
2 o'clock!
They're coming in!
They're coming
under you, Ben.
Hold your hats.
I'm coming.
Take 'em, Bill,
take 'em!
Look out!
5 o'clock!
I'm coming up from 5!
[Gunfire]
How's our sweetheart,
Mr. Holloway?
Spurting oil
like her heart's busted.
Close the intercom.
Watch out.
Zero on your tail.
Blue plate special
coming up.
Get him! Get him!
[Gunfire]
Sink,you--
[Explosion]
Goodbye, him.
Nice work.
Square in the belly.
[Gunfire]
Pilot to Radioman,
are you all right?
Mike, are you
all right?
I think that burst got him,
Mr.Jacobson.
Better bail out,
Tommy.
We haven't much time.
Were you hit, Mike?
Shut off your intercom,
Jacobson.
I can't.
My equipment's shot up.
Mike, are you O.K.?
It's my leg, sir.
Can you move them?
Mike, can you
move your legs?
Uh-uh.
We're burning
back here.
You'd better
bail out, sir.
I haven't got
the altitude, Mike.
We'll take this ride
together.
Jacobson,join up.
Do you hear me, Hans?
Join up, I tell you.
Enemy planes approaching.
All hands stand by.
Enemy planes approaching.
Hard left!
Hard left!
Hard right rudder!
[Bomb Whistling]
The bomb that hit aft damaged the hydraulic lines that control the landing gear.
How long to repair?
Hard to say, sir.
The returning planes will be low on gas.
I want that gear operating by the time they're in sight.
I want a report on damage and our maximum possible speed.
The engine room reports we can only make 20 knots.
We'll need 25 knots to land our planes.
Report that below.
Aye, aye, sir.
Call out the after-damage control party.
20 men from the V-3 division.
Clear that damage.
Hurry it up!
The flight deck officer reports it's impossible to repair the after-flight deck in less than 45 minutes.
You got just 20 minutes to repair that flight deck.
When the planes return, they'll have a deck to land on.
Sir, escort has picked up enemy submarine on the sound detector.
We got a plane left to launch?
One, sir.
Just repaired.
Launch her.
Launch catapult bomber.
Launch catapult bomber.
Launch catapult bomber.
Launch catapult bomber.
Rapid gunners, hold your fire.
Catapult plane being launched.
We're going to be hit.
Who was flying that plane?
Ensign Cunningham, sir.
That the one they call Cookie?
Yes, sir.
Sir, Torpedo Five and fighter escort returning.
Prepare to land planes.
Prepare to land planes.
Code this to the other carriers--
As soon as planes have landed, changing course
60 degrees southeast for cover of rain squall till repairs are completed.
Aye, aye, sir.
[Playing Reveille]
Red, this is Molton.
What now?
Radar picked up disturbances at 85 miles, altitude 5,000 feet, but they've settled down to a single object.
We can hear it now.
Sounds like a TBF.
You hear that, Molton?
Could be a TBF.
Any of yours straggling?
Wait a minute.
Oscar was just passing over the cargo when she blew up.
Maybe...
Scott is the only one not accounted for.
Thanks, Red.
Mr. Scott?
You figure the carrier ducked under that soup?
Maybe.
They weren't at the rendezvous.
Keep your chin up.
I'm not afraid of anything anymore,
Mr. Scott.
Today's my birthday.
How old are you today, B.G.?
1 7, sir.
You hear that Benny?
Hey, Benny.
I'll get him down.
Mr. Scott, couldn't we break radio silence long enough to get a fix?
Nobody would like that better than I would, B.G.
No dice.
Brother, how I could use a spotlight now.
That's Ensign Scott, sir.
He doesn't know our new course.
Couldn't we break radio silence?
You don't have to give him a position theJaps can check.
Just say,
''We're right under you.
Ceiling, 50 feet.
Come on down.''
If you think theJaps have a radar fix on him, let me go up.
I can lead him down.
That's as useful to the enemy as breaking radio silence.
We can't risk this carrier.
What about that kid--
That's enough, Molton.
Check your casualty list and reform your squadron.
Yes, sir.
[Engine Faltering]
[Plane Diving]
[Crash]
First it was Gus, then Brainard, then Chuck, and then Hans.
But at least he had a fighting chance.
But not Oscar.
He didn't have a chance.
Up there, going back and forth, and nobody made an effort to help him down.
Do you know what these are?
They're casualty lists.
They're obituaries of a long list of friends of mine.
Yes, friends.
If I seemed too tough on the boys, it was because I was responsible for them.
I didn't want to lose them any more than I wanted to lose those boys up there.
You think I wanted to let Scott fly until he dove into the sea?
You think I want to dream about them on a raft until their bodies rot?
I'm an air officer.
There are things I can do and things I can't do.
I can check casualty lists, and I can order more men into the air to become new casualties.
I can refuse to endanger the lives of 3,000 men in order to save the lives of three men.
I do those things because they're my job, and I've got to do them.
But to be accused of refusing to save those men because I didn't want to save them--
[Ringing]
Torpedo Ready Room.
Molton speaking.
It's for you, sir.
Yes.
Very good.
A destroyer picked up
Scott and his crew.
His radioman was lost, but he and his gunner are O.K.
They got him!
He's back in!
How about that?
He's back in the ballgame.
Thanks, Ed.
Period.
Secure.
How about that?
Commander Harper.
Orders for tomorrow--
1 4 TBFs,
1 9 SB2Cs...
Oh, Dr. Lazar.
Good morning, good morning.
- Good afternoon, commissioner.
- What?
Yes, it is. Good afternoon, good afternoon.
I've just been glancing through your health and sanitation reports for July.
- Oh, and are they as dull as that?
- Not at all, not at all.
Facts are never dull, except this wretched gout of mine.
Didn't the medicine I gave you ease the pain?
Certainly. And it also counteracts the effect of good whiskey.
- And it is good whiskey.
- Yes.
Well, how was your trip through the jungle this time, Lazar?
Oh, routine. I gave the natives plenty of quinine and a hint or two on sanitation.
You've certainly solved the problem of dealing with the natives.
That's one advantage of being partially native myself. Please.
Of course. A spot of soda.
You know, the territory of Bugandi is coming under our jurisdiction.
- I've been sending up men and supplies.
- Yes, so I've noticed.
Well, Bugandi will be in need of good doctors.
Would you be willing to accept an appointment there?
It would mean a promotion.
Well, I am deeply indebted to the government, of course.
If it were not for them, I might still be an ignorant, superstitious savage...
...running around in a loincloth.
But I have my hands full in this territory.
I don't like to leave a job half-finished.
- I'll convince you yet, Lazar.
- We shall see.
I'm being transferred up there myself.
I don't mind in the least.
Between you and me, this place is becoming infernally dull. Cheerio.
Tarzan must be in town.
- Oh, he's in town, all right.
- Yes.
Your strength is that of 10, my friend.
Again you have defeated
Tongolo the Terrible.
- Better luck next time.
- Always you say that, my friend.
And always when you come each year to Zambesi, it is the same.
With Tarzan, Tongolo is not so terrible.
Tarzan, we came to Zambesi to buy some gifts...
...not to wrestle, remember?
- Tarzan not forget.
Last time we shop, I carry everything.
- Do I have to go along?
- No, Boy.
I have lots of relatives in England and they all want gifts from Africa.
Cheeta and I'll look around, then.
- Yes, lady?
- Oh, the last time I was here...
...you had some little, white, carved ivory elephants.
- Oh, yes, the ones inlaid with gold.
- That's right. Would you show me some?
It is unfortunate madam wasn't here two days ago.
Then, I had no less than 50 of the carved elephants, but...
Surely you haven't sold them all in two days.
Oh, no. I sent them all by caravan to Bugandi.
They shall fetch high prices in the bazaars there now.
Oh, dear, and Aunt Agnes asked me especially for something in ivory.
Tarzan send Aunt Agnes big lion tooth.
Oh, that would frighten her to death.
We'd better look for something else.
At your service, lady.
Haven't you more of that flower design
I got here the last time?
Alas, lady, if only you were here two days ago.
Then, I had no less than 30 rolls of the silk you describe, but...
But you loaded it all in a caravan and shipped it off to Bugandi.
A miracle. The lady reads my mind.
- Next week we have plenty more.
- Jane better shop in the jungle next time.
Guess I'll have to.
Always they screech like that when
I perform. They are ruining my business.
They are taking the bread from the mouth of my snake.
If you don't mind, let's stop at the school for a moment.
- Why, Jane.
- Hello, Miss Wetherby.
Oh, how nice to see you.
Tarzan and Boy.
Good gracious, how you've grown.
Yes, he's almost keeping pace with your young ladies.
Do you know, Jane, that they've been chosen to go as teachers to Bugandi?
- To Bugandi?
- Yes.
The government is setting up a school system there.
So under the new arrangement...
...Bugandi will have the opportunities we've given the natives here.
That's wonderful, isn't it, Tarzan?
Children in Bugandi learn quick with pretty teachers.
They'll get lots of apples.
- And when does this all take place?
- They leave on the next caravan.
Oh, well, congratulations, girls.
Tarzan and I both wish you luck.
- Thank you.
- Pretty girls always have luck.
Cheeta.
Put that flute away.
For your school.
There must be things you need.
Oh, no, Jane, you've been so good to us already.
Oh, very well.
- Easy. Easy, now.
- Try to tell us what happened.
Our caravan attacked.
Elephants stampeded.
All killed. Only I...
The caravan to Bugandi attacked.
How? Where?
Leopards. Leopards...
- He's dead.
- Poor fellow.
How appalling. A whole caravan wiped out by leopards.
I wonder if the other caravans got through safely.
But what about these girls, commissioner?
They can't go to Bugandi if it isn't safe.
Of course not.
We'll organize a hunt at once.
- Leopards not kill man.
- What's that?
- Man not killed by leopards.
- The man said so himself.
- He was killed by them.
- Leopards never kill with claws alone.
Use teeth.
Well, if... If not leopards, what then?
Don't know. Maybe man think leopards.
Well, whatever it is,
I intend to hunt them down.
- Sergeant, assemble your men.
- Tarzan go too.
Oh, Tarzan, haven't you had enough hunting during your life?
- I think we better go home.
- No, let's go with them.
We go with safari. Maybe we find out what did attack caravan.
That's right, Tarzan.
You come along with us.
Cheeta! Cheeta! Cheeta, where are you?
- Are you coming along with us, doctor?
- I should enjoy going with you.
But my work holds me here.
No, it's your turn for adventure, commissioner.
- Good hunting.
- Thank you.
- See anything yet?
- No, not yet.
If it wasn't leopards, then what could it be?
Maybe something like leopard that isn't leopard.
Something like leopard that isn't leopard?
That's something I've never heard of.
You sure you haven't got a touch of the sun, Tarzan?
Tarzan is clever.
His experience in the jungle has taught him to suspect.
- It is the hunter who will be hunted.
- No, Ameer.
We must be cautious because of Tarzan.
So the commissioner has come to hunt leopards.
Tarzan, too, will find leopards.
No enemy is more harmless than he who has been killed by ridicule.
Well, Tarzan, what do you say now?
- Something wrong.
- Really?
Sorry, Jane. Little...
Come along, men.
By the way, if you should see any of those leopards that aren't leopards...
...be sure to let me know.
- Maybe Tarzan will.
Cheeta!
Cheeta! Come on.
Ameer?
- All went well?
- All went well.
The commissioner returns to Zambesi...
...satisfied that he has cleared the trail of killer leopards.
And Tarzan returns home, ridicule still ringing in his ears.
Then you should be happy, but you seem weary.
I am weary, weary of the greed and pretense of civilization.
This servile government official, who calls himself a commissioner...
...has reduced the people of Zambesi to a race of sniveling shopkeepers...
...fit only to carve toy images of elephants and other such baubles.
The Zambesis are clever with their hands, not their heads.
- But our people...
- Will suffer the same fate.
Bugandi, our rightful territory, will soon be overrun.
Already, this commissioner, bursting with self-importance...
...has had the audacity to offer me a position there.
Naturally, it would mean a promotion.
You torture yourself for my people, Ameer.
They are my people too.
There is so much to be done.
I've studied the ways of civilization in their universities.
I know the decadence of their puerile teachings.
Yet always I've been restless...
...until the love for my own people drew me back to them.
My people are fortunate to be given the fruits of your wisdom and experience.
Yet they grow careless.
They permitted one man to escape and bring news to Zambesi.
True, Ameer. But those that were guilty of this carelessness have been punished.
Yet one more such error...
- What are you doing here, Kimba?
- Nothing, only I listened.
Your ears grow too big for your head.
Careful they are not cut off.
Not even you, Ameer, would harm the brother of Lea, the high priestess.
- Do not be too sure of that.
- Please, Ameer. Kimba, leave us.
I leave, all right.
Let Tarzan make trouble. I do not care.
What is this about Tarzan?
Because I have big ears, because I always listen...
...I know Tarzan was not fooled by leopards.
You say this to annoy me.
Even after Tarzan see leopards, he still not fooled.
I hear him say he find out.
Maybe I go watch Tarzan.
No, Kimba. I do not wish it so.
We will have no further trouble with Tarzan.
I return now to Zambesi to congratulate the commissioner on his successful hunt.
- He hates me.
- No, Kimba, that isn't true.
Why didn't he send me to watch?
We've avoided Tarzan ever since we've been here.
But if I go, my eyes can see all the jungle man does.
- My ears can hear all he say.
- You're not old enough.
But it's time for me to prove to be warrior.
- You say he was not fooled?
- No, I'm sure.
- You go only to watch?
- Yes, Lea. I'll only go watch.
- You will be careful.
- I'll only go watch Tarzan...
...and lady with golden hair.
Little boys should not spy on warrior.
You, a warrior?
If you are, show us the heart of one you have killed.
When I come back,
I will show you a heart.
Why don't you stop this racket, Cheeta.
You'll never be a musician.
All right, then. Go on and try and be a snake charmer.
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Tarzan!
- What is it, Boy?
- It's busted again.
Not the shower bath.
If I've asked Tarzan once,
I've asked him a hundred times.
Bet you Tarzan's gonna catch it now.
Oh, Tarzan, I've practically begged you to fix that shower...
...and here you just sit.
- Tarzan thinking.
I thought so. Really, Tarzan...
...you've let the whole place go to rack and ruin, just because...
Now what is it?
You're not so clever, Cheeta.
Look at that bird.
He's 20 times smaller than you are, and he has 10 times your brain.
Here, give me the flute.
Bird do everything just like Boy.
Why, yes, dear, but what's so strange about that?
If animal can act like man, maybe man can act like animal.
What on earth are you talking about?
Maybe caravan people killed by men.
Men who kill like leopards.
This is too fantastic.
I'm beginning to believe the commissioner was right...
...in saying you had a touch of the sun.
You saw the leopards with your own eyes.
Jane.
Tarzan!
Well, there's your man like leopard:
My parlor rug.
Now what do you say?
Tarzan say, better fix shower.
- Will it take long to fix it, Tarzan?
- Not long.
- Tarzan get bamboo right now.
- I'll go with you.
Help!
Help!
Oh, save me, save me!
Kimba run from lion.
- Where boy come from?
- Jungle.
- What part of jungle?
- Far away.
- Well, are you alone?
- Alone.
Oh, don't be afraid. It's only Cheeta.
What tribe you belong to?
Don't question any further, Tarzan.
Can't you see he's frightened?
And he's probably hungry.
Very hungry.
How long since you've eaten?
Two, three day, maybe.
Kimba forget.
Well, here, let's take him to the house.
You don't look weak.
I mean, after all that time in the jungle.
Kimba weak like other boys, he die in jungle.
But we can't just turn him out like a wild animal.
All right.
Kimba stay for a little while.
Kimba, we'd like for you to stay with us until you feel strong enough to go home.
Kimba thanks kind lady with golden hair.
These men have proven their worthiness.
By no word or sign will they betray our secrets.
Deep in the jungle, they have lived as the leopard lives.
They have endured hardships and hunger.
They have fought as wild beasts.
They have proven themselves warriors by bringing back a heart...
...which they offered to the leopard god as a symbol of their worthiness.
I welcome you who have come to join our crusade.
Behold the leopard god.
Swear before him to obey all those to whom he confides his sacred will.
We swear.
These skins are your disguise.
These claws are your weapons.
That's right, Kimba.
You're getting along beautifully.
Jane!
Oh, Jane! We're going to get bamboo to fix the shower now.
- I can hardly believe it.
- This time Tarzan fix sure.
Why don't you go with them?
Tarzan and Boy do not like Kimba.
Oh, you mustn't think that, of course they like you.
See, they're used to doing everything together.
Why, they often leave me alone for days.
Then Kimba must stay.
Nonsense. You run along.
Kimba promised to help Jane.
Kimba keep promise.
You certainly are a boy after my own heart.
I don't know how I ever got along without you.
What?
Even Cheeta's beginning to see things in the jungle that aren't there.
Wonder who could've taken my knife.
It couldn't have been
Boy playing leopard again.
I wonder if one of those terrible leopards is around here again.
Jane!
We brought enough bamboo to build a whole new shower.
- What wrong, Jane?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
I wonder if...
Kimba! Kimba, are you there?
What's happened, Jane? You look so...
Somebody call Kimba?
- Kimba, I thought you were in the house.
- Kimba was looking for you.
Wanted to give you something.
I thought maybe...
Did you see anything of a...?
- Well, it looked like...
- Jane.
What is it?
Nothing really.
Thank you, Kimba.
You'd better get busy, Tarzan.
All right.
What happened?
For a minute, I thought Tarzan might be right about...
About...
Oh, no, it couldn't be.
It just couldn't be.
Need more vine.
I noticed some lying behind the well.
- Kimba...
- Kimba fetch for Jane.
- Tarzan, I must talk to you.
- What?
It has to do with the idea you had about...
...people who imitate animals.
Jane make bad joke.
Tarzan forget all about that.
Tarzan, I'm not joking.
Here.
That seems very little.
I'm sure Kimba can find some more.
This enough.
Your orders are to accompany the caravan to Bugandi, then await my arrival.
- Is that clear?
- Quite clear, sir.
Remember, girls, when you get to Bugandi...
...you'll each have your own responsibilities.
- We're sorry to be leaving you.
- You've been wonderful.
- Here we are, off on the big trip, eh?
- We thank you, sir, for this opportunity.
We'll try to make you and Miss Wetherby proud of us.
Splendid, splendid.
It's the government who thanks you.
And now, as the French say, bon voyage.
- Goodbye, Miss Wetherby.
- Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, girls.
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Good luck.
- Are you absolutely sure...?
- That the caravan is safe?
Perfectly. As safe as Zambesi itself.
I wouldn't think of sending the girls out if I had the slightest doubt.
God bless you, girls.
You should be proud that your young ladies...
...have the privilege of pioneering a new frontier.
I am proud, but I'll never be really happy until I know my girls have arrived safely.
They will.
Has Kimba returned yet?
Not yet, my priestess.
Send warriors and have him brought back at once.
For many days, we have been draining the manpower of our enemies...
...by our raids on their caravans.
Yet such is their greed...
...that still they send out caravans loaded with goods and treasures.
Be not deceived. Every diabolical element on earth is at work in Zambesi.
And now they hope to bring Bugandi under the control of their civilization...
...that detests our way of life.
They will stop at nothing to destroy us.
They are ready to kill us for our beliefs.
No! No! No!
We must finally put a stop to these people from Zambesi.
We must never rest.
Or soon, all our territory will be invaded.
Why have they come to our land?
So that they can exploit the rich resources of our jungle...
...and steal from us the treasure that is rightfully ours.
Away with them!
Down with them!
Away with them! Down with them!
If our leopard god grant that
I live to fulfill his purpose...
...I shall lead you to the utter destruction of their false protestations...
...of liberty, of freedom, of sniveling piety.
Yeah!
Already on the trail, four maidens have set out from Zambesi...
...sent by our enemies to corrupt the minds of the people of Bugandi.
To arouse our own blood brothers to take up arms against us.
- Shall we permit this to happen?
- No!
Go now to attack the caravan.
Though not as men, but as leopards.
Go silently, stealthily.
Destroy every human being.
Yet see that the four maidens are brought here to the temple alive.
Then I shall disclose to you what our leopard god decrees for the future.
Mongo, lead the warriors and may the leopard god's will be fulfilled.
It's all right, Cheeta, you can come out now.
Cheeta?
What have you got there?
Give it to me.
Wait till Tarzan sees this.
Kimba.
Kimba. Wait.
What is it, Cheeta?
Where?
- No, Tarzan. Wait, I...
- No time for talk. Boy in danger.
Kimba?
Tarzan.
There's hundreds of them.
They've captured the girls.
- What girls?
- From Zambesi.
The leopard men have got them at the river. Hurry, Tarzan.
Wait, Tarzan!
Tarzan! Kimba! Kimba and Jane!
Take two men. Follow him.
We will head him off downriver.
Run, girls. Tarzan follow.
Where have you been, Kimba?
I was looking for something.
Kimba, must you play with that knife?
Can't you find something else?
Kimba was looking for something else, but not there anymore.
Put that knife away.
Did you hear me?
I said, put that knife away.
Boy.
Tarzan was right all the time.
Now I take back two hearts.
Boy.
Thanks, Cheeta.
- Boy, are you all right?
- I'm all right.
- Oh, you're hurt.
- It's nothing.
What do we do with him?
- Tie him up, lock him in the storehouse.
- All right.
Keep your eyes on him, Cheeta.
Where is my brother?
Speak! Where is Kimba?
- It is useless. He will not answer.
- I will make him talk.
Lea.
Dr. Lazar.
You were quite right, Tarzan.
Man not killed by leopards.
Now that you have discovered us, you, too, will die.
Not till he tells where Kimba is.
What is this about Kimba?
Forgive me, Ameer. Against your will,
I sent Kimba to watch Tarzan.
Wherever Kimba is, there is trouble.
Even though we destroy Tarzan, his people might...
Mongo, send warriors to the jungle man's house.
Find Kimba. Bring him and Tarzan's people here.
Yes, Ameer.
And we could stop over in India on the way.
I'm sure Tarzan would agree to it.
I want you to meet people and know the way they live.
There's so much to see and learn that's new and exciting.
You would enjoy that, wouldn't you, Boy?
What? Oh, yes.
Jane...
...do you think Tarzan...?
- We could leave as soon...
What's the use, Jane?
Tarzan should be back.
He should've been back long ago.
- Boy, Tarzan wouldn't want us to worry.
- I know, but...
And he certainly wouldn't want us to be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Quick, Jane, into the house.
Tarzan!
First thing I do when we reach
Bugandi is to get hold of Dr. Lazar.
Capable fellow, Lazar, but careless at times.
No business to go off into the jungle before he saw I had plenty of medicine.
- No, sir.
- My God, this foot hurts.
Yes, sir.
Must get Lazar to accept that appointment.
Yes, sir.
Nothing like a good pipe, is there, corporal?
- No, sir.
- Especially after a job well done, huh?
Yes, sir.
I think I can safely say that the caravan trail to Bugandi...
...will not be troubled with killer leopards for some time to come.
Yes, sir.
Oh, do not be afraid.
I will not let others harm you.
- Leave.
- No.
You are not my leader. My sister is.
You've done nothing but cause trouble.
Go. Do not try my patience.
Did not I, your leader, promise you a greater glory if you brought...
...the Zambesi maidens to the temple?
- Yeah!
That greater glory is now at hand.
No longer shall we be content raiding the caravans of our enemies.
Now our leopard god has decreed that I lead you to Zambesi itself.
To Zambesi!
We shall fall upon our enemies and then slay them.
Our crusade will be fulfilled.
Yet, remember.
Though our enemies are stupid, they are many and we are few.
Let us humbly beseech our leopard god to endow us with his own courage...
...his own strength, his own cunning.
Let us seek his favor with a sacrifice.
But not a sacrifice of the hearts of dead men.
This time let us offer him living hearts.
The hearts of the Zambesi maidens!
And the man that interfered.
His fate, too, shall be death.
But before he dies, he shall see his woman and his boy slain.
Cheeta.
Get others free.
You did this, you...
What was that?
Oh, no rest for the weary.
I suppose I'd better investigate.
Kimba want heart. Kimba get heart.
Lazar's heart. Kimba dead too.
What's all the excitement?
- Big fight with the leopard men.
- Lazar tried to kill us.
- They kidnapped us.
- It was awful.
- You have no idea.
- There are leopard people. Tarzan's right.
Lazar and the dead leopard boy are in the cave.
Leopard boy? Leopard people?
Lazar a killer?
Is everybody mad?
Am I the only sane person around here?
Look. Look out!
What's all this monkey business?

You are about to take the oath of allegiance to your country and to a regiment that in hard battle on many fields has earned the nickname,
"The Fighting 69th."
No man has ever let the regiment down.
Don't forget that.

Can you read that?
I say, can you read that?
Only the letters.
I don't know what it means.
Go on, read the letters.
"B" is for Brooklyn, "Y" is for Yonkers,
"Q" for Queens, "H" for Harlem and "X" marks the Bronx.
Come on. Get moving.
- Open that shirt. Over there.
- Thanks.
That's a funny crack, ain't it?
Breathe deeply.
Hey, you, I been all through this before over in the Armory. What's the big idea?
- Oh, really? What's your name?
- Plunkett. What's yours?
Put Private Plunkett on report.
"Addressing medical officer as
"Hey, you." Insubordination.
"What's the big idea?"
- Yes, Major.
- Major?
You're in the army now.
Stand up. Breathe.
I'm sorry.
Roll your sleeves up, way up!
Ouch!
Fine bunch of soldiers, can't even take a little pin prick.
It ain't that.
It's the serum that makes you keel over.
What are you trying to hand me?
All right, keep moving, fellows.
Keep still, will you?
Just a little bayonet practice, buddy.
What? No backbone?
Get off that table!
- Does it hurt much, Doc?
- Not much.
Oh, Mr. Doctor, please don't hurt me. Please.
Sir, I've already had these here shots.
Fine. You'll be twice as healthy.
Oh, I never saw such a mob in all my life.
Go ahead, Admiral. Shoot the works.
Thanks.
Four union suits, wool, long.
Union suits, wool, long.
Two shirts, OD, 16.

Britches, OD, 42.
- What do you mean, 42?
- One hat.
What's the matter with you?
I can't wear these pants.
- They're four sizes too big.
- Next.
Hey, wait a minute, you.
Come on, here. Keep moving.
Don't hold up the war.
But these pants are too big.
They'll fall down.
That's your problem. Get going.
You big, thick donkey.
- What'd you say?
- I said it was nice and cool out.
Come on, you fellows! Get out of it!
Come on!
Rise and shine!
Come on! Get it together!
Roust out of there, dope heads!
Rise and shine.
Come on, Cleopatra, vacate that couch!
So the lady says,
"Can I help it if my son worries?"
Come on, shake a leg. Snap out of it.
Well, well, well, who's this darling little sleepyhead?
Beg pardon, but as a personal favor to Pershing,
- would you mind dragging out of here?
- Go on, beat it.
Listen, are you gonna come quiet like or do I gotta...
Oh, it must be a nightmare.
Go away, will you?
- Tell me. Do you know what that tune is?
- Yeah, I know.
It's 15 minutes to reveille and I don't like it.
I don't like you, either.
Now, go on, tell the Colonel he wants you.
Why, you big, Irish, no-good heel, you...
Smart guy.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
What's the matter, Plunkett?
You got two left feet?
One, two, three, four.
One, two...
Come on up there, Wynn.
Squads, left about! Hey!
Close up there.
Squads right, hut.
Oh, that's beautiful.
A lot of baboons on roller skates couldn't do better.
One, two, three, four.
Bayonet exercise. Guard!
That elbow down, Wynn.
Ready. Thrust!
Ready. Thrust!
Ready. Lunge!
No, no, no, no.
What do you guys think you're doing?
Tickling your grandmas?
Them's bayonets, not bodkin needles.
Give me that rifle.
When you lunge, lunge.
Get him or he'll get you.
Stick him in the throat or in his chest, or in the belly.
Don't waste your steel, see?
And when you lunge, six inches is enough.
And if your bayonet gets stuck, don't put your foot on his chest.
Pull the trigger and shoot it out.
Now, you got that, lame brain?
Come, on, snap into it.
Make believe that dummy's the guy you hate the most.
Ready. Lunge!
That's for you, Mike. How do you like it?
Inspection. Arms!
Order. Arms!
Wake up, Wynn.
As you were.
What's your name, lug?
Sure, me name's Mike Murphy,
Sergeant Your Honor.
Well, stand fast till you get the orders to move.
Right.
- Did you say your name was Murphy?
- I did, Your Worship, saving your presence.
- What were you born?
- Sure, I was born a boy.
Pipe down.
- What name were you born with?
- Mischa Moskowitz.
- Where'd you get the Murphy?
- I took it.
You see, sir, I wanted to go over with the Fighting 69th.
Okay?
Okay, Mike. Oh, look at young Wynn.
With a chest like a sparrow.
- Suck it in! Stick it out!
- Hey, cut it out, will you, Mike?
It's Sergeant Wynn to you, and like it.
I'll make a soldier out of you yet.
Now, one more thing.
Don't you fellows go wandering too far away after chow.
I've got good news for you.
Major Donovan's taking the battalion out on night tactics, with full packs.
Pipe down. Or you'll never get dismissed.
I'm sick and...
Fasten that collar! Suck in that gut!
Try and look like a soldier! And you, too.
You're no privileged character.
Heave those shoulders back!
Dismissed!
- What are you so tired about?
- I don't know. Maybe you make me tired.
What's that?
I joined this outfit to go over there and fight, not to stay around here doing "squads, east" for six months.
- Is that so?
- Yeah. And another thing.
I ain't used to getting up at 5:30 in the morning to take 25-mile hike and get pushed around by you.
And you don't like it, huh?
There's a lot of things in this man's army I don't like.
Well, now, that's really tough.
But I think I know what you need.
A little diversionment.
Now, there's a great big pile of potatoes that needs peeling.
And you're gonna peel them and keep on peeling them until we leave Camp Mills.
Button up that collar!
Night tactics in this weather.
Well, that fixes us.
Give me a cigarette, will you, soldier?
Look, Crepe Hanger, don't you ever buy any of your own?
For what? I'll take that match.
Do you know how many guys have died of pneumonia on night tactics in the last 10 years?
What's the use of going out at night, anyway?
You can't see the enemy in the dark.
Quit your crabbing.
It's all part of the game.
Yeah, some game.
Get shoved around by that Wild Bill Donovan and that big, thick mick of a tough Sergeant.
Hey, listen, you.
Lay off of that "thick mick" stuff.
Listen, flannel-mouth,
I'll say what I please.
- And if you don't like it, I'II...
- Hey, Wynn.
Keep away from that loud-mouth Plunkett.
He's a wrong soldier and he'll get you into trouble. Savvy?
All right. What are you sore about?
I might as well be in the cavalry.
Yes, and a horse at that.
All I get is riding from you.
"Snap into it, Wynn. Snap out of it, Wynn."
Keep your shirt on.
I can't let the rest of this mob say I'm playing favorites with me own kid brother.
- Sergeant.
- Attention!
As you were.
What's the big idea keeping the company in formation after the others were dismissed?
Listen, John, just because we're...
Lieutenant to you, and don't you forget it.
Nobody's gonna accuse me of playing favorites.
And that goes for you, too.
Button up that collar.
What do you think this is, Coxey's Army?
What would Ma say if she could see you streeling around like this?
Say, you could use a hair cut, too.
Did you hear from Ma, sir?
Or would the lieutenant be so condescending as to tell us how she's feeling?
Or do I get a court-martial for asking?
She's feeling fine and she wants us to see that he brushes his teeth.
- I'll tell Corporal Healey.
- Say, now listen...
- Pipe down!
- Quiet!
Go back into your quarters and put that blunder-buss away.
The hunting season hasn't opened yet.
Hang this up in my tent while you're about it, too, will you?
You...
You know, it's a shame to keep riding him.
How's he doing?
Well, I hate to say it, but I think he's all 69th.
Left, hut.
Left, hut.
- Hello, Jack.
- Father.
- How's Mrs. O'Keefe?
- Expecting again, sir.
Now, I didn't ask her condition.
I asked about her health.
- Oh, she's fine, thank you, Father.
- Good.
The division's filling up, Father.
The 4th Alabama's coming in.
Well, you'll all be making history in a few months.
Maybe sooner than you think.
We'll need your prayers, Father.
When did an Irishman ever need a prayer in a fight?
What are you reading there?
Oh, by the way, did you ever get up the courage to talk to Kilmer?
I've been intending to.
Do you think he'd mind?
- Oh, Joyce.
- Yes, Father?
Lieutenant Ames has a favor to ask of you.
Yes. Would you autograph this for me?
I'd be very pleased to, Lieutenant.
- Do you have a pen?
- I have.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're quite welcome, sir.
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.
- Going my way, Corporal?
- Yes, sir.
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye, son.
Got a match, buddy?
Thanks.
- I don't think I met you yet.
- I been around.
Plunkett's my name. Jerry Plunkett.
Smiling Jerry they call me on account of my disposition. What's yours?
Fiery Frank. Duffy for short.
Irish, huh? I am, too, but I don't work at it.
I don't like these flannel-mouth micks who go around singing
Molly Malone all the time.
I think maybe you're in the wrong outfit.
This regiment has certain traditions.
Oh, don't give me that malarkey.
We both joined up for the same thing.
To come back dripping with medals.
Big shots, the world our oyster.
- Our what?
- Oysters.
You know, you eat them. Oysters.
- How did you leave things in Brooklyn?
- Swell.
- How did you know I was from Brooklyn?
- That was my third guess.
Hey, you ain't so dumb for a soldier.
You steer me right around here, Duffy, and we'll get places.
Now, just to bind our friendship, a friend of mine gave me one in the Fifth at Saratoga.
You can have it. Look.
Rest!
Hi, buddy.
Tell you what.
Let's and me go AWOL tonight, huh?
I got some swell numbers here.
Good-Iooking dames, right here.
Am I glad I transferred out of them Engineers.
This outfit eats right, don't it, boy?
- Hey, soldier. What's your outfit?
- 4th Alabama.
- That's down South, ain't it?
- You know it's the truth.
One thing you gotta have if you're gonna soldier proper, and that's chow.
Well, there's nothing to kick about here, is there?
Hi, dixie.
Did you bring any corn pone with you?
- Done better than that, friend.
- Yeah?
You all better come over tonight for a mess of possum pie.
Say, what kind of a trip did you have coming up here?
Well, when we got up as far as Pennsylvania the temperature dropped right down to 99.
- Like to froze to death.
- You don't say so.
- Hey, when are we going overseas?
- Don't be in a hurry.
They're holding the war back for you Alabama fellows.
- What outfit do you all belong to?
- Why we're the Fighting 69th.
The Fighting 69th? Quite a handle.
Where'd you get it?
- Oh, Civil War. What's your outfit?
- 4th Alabama.
Wait a minute. You say your Civil War fighting got you that name?
Sure thing. Ain't you never heard of us?
You wouldn't be the 69th New York Irishers, would you?
Sure are. So you heard about us, huh?
I'll say we have.
Hey, folks, these is the 69th New York.
Want to know if we remember them.
Hey, what's so funny?
Do we remember you?
Do you remember us?
You ought to.
We shot the pants off of your outfit once.
Say that again.
Who shot the pants off of who?
We did. The 4th Alabama.
We shot the pants off you, the 69th New York at Mary's Heights in 1862.
Hey. Look, a fight.
- Who's fighting who?
- What do you care? Come on.
- Well, it's a good fight all right.
- Yeah. But somebody's gonna get hurt.
- The saps.
- Help me break it up, Jerry.
Not me, pal. You don't get medals for that kind of fighting.
Hey, break it up.
Break it up.
Break it up here!
Break it up. Break it up.
Terence. Casey. Clanahan.
Come on.
Beat it, gang. Donovan!
Come on, break it up.
Break it up, you men.
The Major!
Get back in your rank.
Here comes the Major. The Major.
Get back in your ranks.
Attention. Back, I said.
Just a minute.
Who started this ballet russe?
Them razorbacks said they shot the pants off of us in the Civil War.
We did.
- He's right. They did.
- What?
At the battle of Fredericksburg.
This outfit, the 4th Alabamans, broke up the charge of the 69th and stopped us right in our tracks.
And you cheered your heads off because you respected a game enemy.
Now, those men on both sides were Americans.
They fought and then rose above their hatreds to become one people again.
And that's the way it should be, or do you think the whole nation is out of step but you?
Our two regiments are now brigaded together.
Their very names are even changed.
The 69th New York, to the
165th United States Infantry.
The 4th Alabamas to the 167th.
Every day, more and more are joining us.
Outfits from all over the country.
Well, they're not coming here as Easterners, or Southerners or Alaskans, or New Englanders.
Those men are coming here as Americans to form an organization that represents every part and section of our country, the Rainbow Division.
But there's no room in this Rainbow for sectional feuds because we're all one nation now, one team, an all-American team, pulling together and known as the United States Army.
So if you must fight, wait until you get overseas.
Believe me, you'll get a belly full of it over there.
Now, go on. Get back to your ranks and behave yourselves.
- Are you hurt, Father?
- Hurt? Now, who'd hurt me?
Oh, it's Father Duffy, is it?
And who am I?
Patsy Dumb-Cluck, I suppose.
Me pal, stringing me along.
You know they can't get away from these Dominus Vobiscum salesmen even in the army.
Well, maybe it's because the saints have their eyes on you, son.
Don't give me that.
I can take care of myself.
Well, maybe you can, but I thought if you ever did need me...
Now look, hard collar, once and for all...
Go on. What do you mean snapping at Father like that?
Take your hand off of me, you big, thick mick.
Why, I got a good notion to chew you up and spit you out.
Go on. Beat it.
My, but it's a violent man you are.
Come on, Jerry, let's get the mud off your smiling face.
Come on, break it up.
Button your collar!
Come on. What's holding you men back?
By the time you get into position the enemy would have a dozen machine guns on you.
Come on! Double up.
I'd like to see you double up and I don't mean from running either.
Why, when we get to France that guy's going out on patrols some nights.
I'm gonna hang bells all over him.
All right, all right. Spread out and fall.
Fall, I said!
Burke, get that stern down!
Come on, come on, simulate firing as soon as you hit the line.
Now, cease firing and follow me.
Wouldn't you know it, as soon as we get comfortable, we gotta get up and at 'em?
Come on, put some swing in it.
You're not dead yet.
No, we're not dead yet.
We're just muscle-bound, flat-footed, fed up and far from home.
Outside of that, we're all right.
A lot that slave-driver cares whether we are or not.
- Pipe down.
- You want to get in trouble?
You ain't no bargain yourself.
Hey, you guys, what are you trying to do, win the war over here?
How much overtime you get?
You guys are sure gluttons for punishment.
What are you training for, the Olympics?
No. We're just
Wild Bill Donovan's chain gang.
So this is the insignia of the Rainbow Division, huh?
- Every color in the spectrum.
- Squads left!
- What's the matter? Don't you like it?
- Oh, indeed I do.
I was just thinking the boys in the 69th might like it better if there was a little green in it.
Squads left. March.
Bill, don't you think maybe you're a little hard on the boys?
Night hikes and forced marches.
After all, they're not used to that grind.
I'll handle the military end of it.
You look after their souls, Father.
- I'm sorry, Bill.
- No. I'm sorry.
But war's a brutal business. I know.
I've seen what's been going on over there.
That's why I've been so hard on the men.
I've got to be, so they'll be able to face what's coming later.
These kids of mine are going up against veterans, schooled in three years of war.
They've got to be able to out-endure and outfight them, not just to be led in half-trained like sheep led to the slaughter.
Don't you suppose
I've wanted to let up on them?
I didn't dare. I've got to think of the future.
- All ready, sir.
- Thank you.
And now, the future has come.
I couldn't tell you this before, but this isn't just another night hike.
This is it.
Give me your blessing, Father.
Amen.
Thank you.
Column of squads.
First Company, squads right.
- Squads right.
- Squads right.
- Squads right.
- Hut.
Almighty God, in thine infinite mercy, grant unto me, thy servant, the wisdom to guide my young flock through the trials of war.
Oh, Father, they're so young.
So young and they know so little of life.
And nothing at all of that terrible and bloody altar towards which they move, carrying so eagerly the bright sacrifice of their youth.
Their need will be great, O Lord, and I am weak.
Therefore, I beseech thee through thy Son, Christ, our Lord, grant me the strength to keep them steadfast in the faith, in decency and courage to the glory of God, their country and their regiment, in the bad times to come.
And if in battle you see fit to gather them to your protecting arms, thy will be done.
But let them die like men, valiant and unafraid.
Come on. Company A fall in.
Come on here.
Come on, fall in here.
Come on, get back in line there.
Come on, fall in, men. Snap it up.
Make it lively. Come on here.
- Get in line there.
- Come on, you fellows.
Throw those cigarettes away. Get in here.
Form this line. Come on.
Snap it up, you mugs.
You move like a lot of sailors.
Come on, put those pipes down.
Right, dress.
- One.
- Two.
- Three.
- Four.
Count off.
- One.
- Two.
- Three.
- Four.
- One.
- Two.
- Three.
- Four.
- One.
- Two.
As you were.
What's the matter with you?
You're three, ain't you?
All by myself.
Why, you swivel-necked far-down...
Three. Now, let's get on with the war.
I came over here to stuff those Dutchmen back in their sausage skins.
And all we do is stand around...
The first thing you know, you'll stuff yourself right in the clink.
And, now, Mr. Funny Man, before it slips my mind, suppose after retreat you report to the mess Sergeant and tell him that you'd like to do a little extra duty as kitchen police.
And stuff that in your pipe and puff on it.
Count off!
- One.
- Two.
- Three.
- Four.
- One.
- Two.
Now, remember, men, we're the first American soldiers to march through the streets of Grand.
I know we're all pretty tired, but let's show the natives the old 69th has what it takes.
Column squads, first company.
- Squads, left.
- Squads, left!
- Squads, left!
- Squads, left!
Squads, left!
March!
Eyes, right.
Front.
Eyes right.
Wonder what we're gonna get to eat when we get billeted?
I heard the Sergeant just say something about slum.
I figure it's about time.
We ain't had any slum since last night.
I got an awful mean feeling, boys, awful mean.
If they don't let us at those Boches pretty soon,
I'll have to carve me up a top Sergeant.
Don't mind him, Sarge.
He's his own worst enemy.
Not while I'm alive, he ain't.
Our present orders are to march to Luneville, starting the day after Christmas.
It's going to be tough going through the Vosges foothills and forests over these icy roads and in this weather.
Think your supply train can keep up with us, Mangan?
It will, sir, if my men have to carry the horses and pull the wagons.
Father Duffy, how about your midnight mass tonight?
Everything's all set, sir, barring the conversion of a few heathen, present company no exception.
- And facilities for the non-Catholics?
- It's all taken care of, sir.
Lieutenant Holmes, the Methodist chaplain, is going to arrange services for the protestant boys.
Oh, and of all people, Mike Murphy is going to build a pulpit for him.
I've wired to GHQ for chaplains for both the Alabamas and the Illinois.
You know, Colonel, if a lot of the people back home knew how well the various faiths got along together over here, it'd cause a lot of scandal to some pious minds.
Well, gentlemen, I guess that's all.
Oh, boy.
Give me a cigarette, will you, McManus?
- Don't you get tired bumming cigarettes?
- No.
- Hello, Father. How are you?
- Hello, boys.
- Glad to see you.
- How are you?
Hey, Father, you're looking pale.
You know, you gotta look after your health in this funny climate.
Yes. It's beginning to get a lot of the boys.
- First, your arms go to sleep.
- They do?
And there's a slight buzzing in your ears.
And the most fatal symptom of all, there's a light feeling in your head.
Father, I got it.
And that means you need exercise.
And the finest thing in the world is pumping an organ at midnight mass.
It'll make a new man of you.
You're gonna pump an organ.
That's one on me, Father.
Paddy, would you like to sweep out the church?
Oh, I wouldn't like to, but I will.
I'll say you will.
I think I'll go to your mass tonight.
That is, if it's okay.
Oh, sure.
That is, if you're sure you want to.
Well, why not?
You know, you're such a swell guy, Father.
- I think I'd go to the devil with you.
- Oh, you would now?
- Well, that is, if you asked me to.
- If I asked you...
Well, I mean, if there's anything I can do to help,
I'd be glad to do it.
Attention!
Hiya, Saint Francis? How's all the monks?
On your feet when an officer comes in the room.
And take that cigarette out of your mouth.
All right, boys. As you were.
- Merry Christmas, Father.
- Merry Christmas, Father.
- See you later.
- Yeah. Right, sir.
Okay.
Oh, don't forget midnight mass.
And confession's this afternoon.
- Okay.
- Okay. We'll be there.
If you need any help, Father, we'll be right outside.
Give us a break and need some help, will you, Father?
It would be a pleasure.
You know, Jerry, you're getting yourself so well liked in this army they'd rather machine gun you than the Germans.
It was bad enough at Camp Mills.
But instead of improving you're getting worse.
- That's what you think.
- No, that's what everyone thinks.
They're beginning to call you a misfit and a troublemaker.
Well, now that's tough.
I'm gonna bust right out crying.
Sit down a minute. I want to talk to you.
You know, Jerry,
I don't think you're as tough as you think.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You're only kidding yourself.
You're your own biggest sucker.
- Oh, yeah?
- Sure.
I've seen too much of life and men.
You know, son, there's only one thing wrong with you.
You're Ionesome, that's all.
Me Ionesome? That's rich.
Oh, sure, I know.
Smart boys don't need anyone.
They can take care of themselves.
But there are some pretty dark days ahead, Jerry, when a man will have need of a friend he can depend on.
You haven't made any friends.
And that's where I thought
I might come in.
To help you find him.
We're going into the trenches right after Christmas.
You're not kidding me, are you?
Well, that's great.
That's what we came over here for.
The sooner the better.
And when was the last time you were to confession?
Oh, I knew you'd worm around to that sooner or later.
- There's midnight mass tonight, Jerry.
- Yeah, so I hear.
And I don't think Christmas is a bad time for any of us to take stock and check up.
Come on, now. What do you say?
Why don't you join the boys tonight?
Now, look, Chaplain.
Get this once and for all.
I came over here to soldier, not to pray.
I don't go for that Holy Joe stuff.
So there's no use trying to convert me.
I'm not trying to convert you, son.
I'm asking you to come back to your religion and recognize the fact of Almighty God.
Well. Merry Christmas, Jerry.
"If a man have a hundred sheep and one should go astray,
"doth he not leave the ninety and nine in the mountains
"and go seeketh that which is gone astray?
"And if it so be that he find it,
"verily I say unto you,
"he rejoiceth more of that,
"than of the ninety and nine which went not astray."
Hey, where do we sleep tonight?
The same place as last night, on the side of the road.
We ain't been on a road since Tuesday.
Ain't you heard, we ain't stopping tonight.
We're going right on.
Anyway, we ain't got nothing to stop for.
The rolling kitchens is back there halfway to Brooklyn.
Yeah, and am I hungry.
You're hungry?
Never mind that.
Pull over at the side of the road and get that kitchen through.
Come on, men. Hey!
Come on, snap into it.
Get them over the side of the road.
Boy, what I could do now to a big grilled steak with lashings of mashed potatoes and gravy.
- Oh, shut up.
- I'm hungry.
I ain't had nothing for three days except hard tack and a can of dog meat.
An army ain't an army unless it eats.
It's just a walking famine.
And you were the guy who said you could find chow in the middle of the Sahara.
Well, I wouldn't call this the Sahara.
Come on, Mahonies, you're doing all right.
- How are you doing, Ryan?
- Okay, sir.
- Not a big out of order, huh?
- No, sir.
- Getting tired, Scully?
- No, sir.
Let me have your pack, will you, O'Mahoney?
No, sir. No man's carrying my pack.
My name's O'Mahony, not O'Mahoney.
What's so funny?
I was just thinking, the Navy rejected me because I had flat feet.
This walking's awful tough, Father.
You should have joined the cavalry, Terrance.
Not me.
When the shooting begins and I gotta get out of there,
I don't want to be hindered by no horse.
Well, look at you.
All dressed up like a tinker's donkey.
- I'm doing all right, ain't I?
- Ah, you're just showing off.
Yeah, sure. And how I can show them.
Wait till we get up in the lines.
Foot slipped.
Yeah. I know.
I can't keep up, Sarge.
These blasted pack-straps are cutting my shoulders off.
Here. Lean on me.
My shoulders. Pack-straps.
My shoulders ache beneath my pack.
- Boy, listen to that gunnery.
- We're getting close to the war.
Sounds like the Fourth at Coney Island.
"My shoulders ache beneath my pack
"Lie easier, cross, upon his back"
I wish I hadn't thrown my extra shoes away.
The squadron has a corn of canned willy left.
- They can have it.
- It always makes me thirsty.
Gosh-darned rifle butt, my fingers is froze.
"My rifle hand is stiff and numb"
Boy, I hope it doesn't rain again tonight.
"From Thy pierced palms red rivers run"
Come on, you sons.
What's the matter with you?
Come on, come on, for the love of Mike!
Keep hiking, will you?
Don't die on your feet.
"Men shout at me who may not speak"
Pick 'em up. This ain't no excursion.
"They scourged thy back and smote thy cheek"
What's that you're muttering?
It may turn out to be a prayer or perhaps only a poem.
You know something?
A guy with your savvy should never be no Sergeant.
You should join the candidate's school and be an officer.
No. I'd have to leave the 69th.
This is it, gentlemen.
The old 69th again faces an enemy.
Major Donovan, you'll take over the front line from the chasseurs.
- Yes, sir.
- McKenna, you'll be in support.
Major Moynihan with the third battalion in reserve.
Any questions?
Don't worry, boys.
We'll all get a crack at 'em.
Kind of wish I wasn't a CO.
I'd like one good inning myself.
Well, I guess that's all.
Good luck, men.
Fall in. First company, right by twos.
March!
Put them on. Pull.
Here we go, boys.
All aboard for the roller coaster.
Do you feel like you're going down in a fast elevator?
- I do.
- Say your prayers, Fritzy.
Your body may belong to the Kaiser, but your soul belongs to Plunkett.
- Shut up!
- Dry up!
You got the loudest mouth in the allied army.
- Plunkett this. What a you think...
- Plunkett.
- Listen to McManus show off.
- Shut up.
- Well, Padre, pray for us.
- I will, indeed.
- The reserve area's back there, Father.
- Yes, I saw it on the map.
But you've gotta go back there, Father.
It's regulations.
It's funny. With all the firing going on,
I seem to have lost my hearing.
- But you can't come up here.
- Yes, I know. I know all about it.
Now, suppose one of the boys met with an accident.
It has been known to happen up here, you know.
You wouldn't deny them the consolation of my master's presence now, will you?
As the priest said to the bishop,
I only go to the races in case one of the jockeys fall off.
That's near enough.
Hey.
You were told to keep your mitts off that Very pistol.
What do you want the heinies to do?
Blow us all over France?
What's the matter, Sarge, you're getting the wind up?
There's always an MP job waiting for you back in Paris, you know.
Or maybe just those stripes taking again, huh?
Maybe you ain't heard tell, soldier.
There's a war going on up here.
Yeah, I read about it in papers but I ain't seen none of it yet.
If this is all there is to it,
I don't see what those limeys and frogs are...
If I were you, I'd keep my big yap shut up about the limeys and the frogs until I earned a fighting man's right to talk.
- And maybe you think I won't.
- Oh, hero stuff, huh?
Would you be satisfied with the Distinguished Service Cross?
Well, if I don't get it, it's because I got a wooden one.
And if you don't believe me, you got a bet.
Gee, that guy hates himself.
Yes, and that makes it unanimous.
Come on, you guys, let's match to see who watches the baby
- and who goes to sleep, huh?
- Nothing doing. We all watch.
- Look at that dent, will you?
- Better there than in your skull.
I'll pay that son off.
Oh, still wanna play, huh? All right.
Better to see you with, Grandma.
- Hey, what're you doing?
- Hey, lay off!
Hey, what're you doing? Cut that out.
Phone headquarters at once.
No one was authorized to send up a flare.
- Yes, sir.
- Here's a kiss for you.
Those heinies seem to be sore at someone.
Where's your duty roster?
- Corporal Sullivan.
- Yes, sir?
Have some coffee, gentlemen.
Duty roster.
Following men report to Sergeant Kilmer for action detail at 4:00 a.m.
Pipe down, will you? Answer your names.
Take it easy now. Quiet.
Here you are, Corporal.
Laffy.
What a spot! What a spot!
Now, what's wrong?
I'm worried. You know what?
Those shells is talking to me.
Yeah? What are they saying?
You ain't never gonna get back to the New York.
- Hey, stretcher-bearers.
- They're wrecking the whole line.
We'll be next!
The Sergeant warned you not to mess with those flares.
All these guys are dead and you done it!
Jack!
O'Keefe!
A bull's-eye.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Get back up to your post!
Let me by! I don't want to stay up there and get blown to pieces.
What do you think I am, crazy?
And you're the one that's always popping off about all the medals you're gonna win, huh?
What kind of 69th man are you?
You yellow skunk!
- Now go on, get back up to that fire-step.
- I won't! I won't!
Steady, men! We'll get out!
Come on, step on it!
- Jerry! Jerry, are you hurt?
- No, Father. No.
What is it, then?
What were you doing in a dugout?
You're supposed to be in the front line on duty!
- Who sent you back?
- Nobody. You see, Father...
Yes, I do see. Indeed I do.
I met Lieutenant Wynn down there, and then the shell hit.
- Where are the rest of them?
- Down there, buried alive.
Let's go.
All right, you guys, now, all together, now.
One, two, heave!
Now, don't let this thing cave in on my head.
All right, now give me your hand.
- I'm dying. My leg's off...
- Give me your hand.
- Here, take his head.
- It's Moran!
- He's out of his head.
- Shut up.
- Got a stretcher, somebody. Hurry up.
- Keep on working, there, you guys.
Have mercy on us. Have mercy.
They're buried alive, all of 'em. Buried.
Now, now, snap out of it, son.
- We'll get the others.
- No, you'll not.
You'll never get them out of there.
Lieutenant Norman's dead with a beam that crushed his head like an egg.
They're all dead, except Eddie Kearney and Lieutenant Wynn.
They can't get out.
They'll be dead in a minute.
Let me make a try at it, will you?
My brother is down there.
I'm sorry, soldier. But there ain't a chance.
- But...
- Steady, kid.
Dolan, I'm going down there.
Hold my ankles.
- Yes, Father.
- Sergeant, get your men to lift this beam.
You can't get down there, Father.
The whole place is gonna cave in in a minute.
- Go on, do as he tells you.
- Yes, sir.
Go ahead, Father.
Ed. Ed Kearney!
John Wynn! It's Father Duffy, boys.
It's Father Duffy.
Can you hear me?
It's just like a tourist kissing the Blarney Stone.
"...perhaps their brave young spirits hear
The bugle sing
"Go to sleep! Go to sleep!
"Slumber well where the shell screamed and fell
"Let your rifles rest on the muddy floor
You will not need them any more
"Danger's past
Now at last
"Go to sleep!
"And up to Heaven's doorway floats
"From the wood called Rouge Bouquet,
"A delicate cloud of bugle notes that softly say
"Farewell!
"Farewell!
"Comrades true, born anew, peace to you!
"Your souls shall be where the heroes are
"And your memory shine like the morning star
"Brave and dear
Shield us here
"Farewell!"
Sit down! Come on, get going.
Them French donkeys don't even understand their own language.
Give me one of them vegetables!
I'll show you how to do it. Angelique!
Hey, look. Why don't we carry the donkey?
Does not one of you understand the sensitive nature of the poor darling?
A donkey's not a gunnery mule.
A donkey's sensitive and high-strung, like a thoroughbred.
Now watch me.
Beer. One. Compris?
There you are.
- American money?
- Keep the change.
Hey, you with the face, ain't you supposed to be on guard duty?
Oh, yeah. Halt! Who's there?
Well, if it ain't old rattlesnake puss.
On your dogs!
Now, wait a minute, Sarge.
This beer is very important.
Take your hands off me, you son of a banshee, or I'll knock your teeth down your throat.
- You'll do what?
- You heard me.
Or are you gonna hide behind those five and ten-cent stripes again?
Plunkett, you've been begging for this for a long time, and now you're gonna get it.
Give it to him.
Move over so he can fall down.
Not yet! Come here! Come on! Come on.
Come on.
You're bouncing around like a rubber ball.
Come on, get up.
Get him, Sarge!
Can't hit me, can you?
Never touched me.
Attention!
Sergeant, what's the meaning of this?
- Well, sir... That is, sir...
- All right, take the air. The party's over.
You know the penalty for hitting a subordinate.
Yes, sir.
Report to your company commander.
You're under arrest.
- Yes, sir.
- You can prefer charges in the morning.
Charges? What charges?
There was no fight, sir.
- What do you mean, no fight?
- No, no. There, there was no fight.
I was just showing Mike...
I mean, the First Sergeant how to roll away from a left hook.
Just a little exhibition for the boys, that was all.
No, there was no fighting.
A real fight,
I'd mop up the joint with the big...
I mean, my friend, the First Sergeant.
No, it was just a gag, we were only fooling.
He never laid a finger on me.
Yeah, so I see.
All right, Sergeant.
Forget that arrest order.
Yes, sir.
And the next time you two want to frolic, don't play so rough.
Well, I guess I'm after owing you something, soldier.
You don't owe me nothing.
I don't need
Donovan to do my fighting for me.
I can do my own, and I love it.
Yeah.
- Well, that settles it.
- Settles what?
Plunkett. Gonna get rid of him.
Transfer him out of the regiment.
- Why? Because of that little brush-up?
- Oh, that and everything else.
He's a bad egg, a troublemaker.
Unreliable in the line.
He's getting himself talked about in a way that the 69th doesn't relish.
Bill, why don't you give the boy a chance?
I happen to know he had a pretty bad shock up there.
Well, it's ruined his value as a soldier.
I've heard nothing but complaints from his company commander on down.
Picking fights back of the lines and dodging patrols when he's up there.
Reporting sick when he's detailed to wiring parties.
Just one excuse after another, whenever there's a man's job to be done.
I won't have a man like that in the battalion.
Bill, I don't want to interfere with discipline.
Don't you think it's possible he has a good side?
I think he showed that.
Well, he can develop it someplace else.
My mind's made up.
Bill.
I think you'll agree that war has ruined many a young fellow. Too many in fact.
Well, now here's an exceptional case, one in a thousand, where maybe the war will do a little good.
Why, Bill, I've heard you say yourself a hundred times, the 69th makes men.
Well, it makes men out of cowards not cowards out of men.
Here's my chance to prove that you're right.
You trust me and keep Plunkett on and I'll assume full responsibility.
Oh, that blarneying tongue of yours.
I should have let them send you home to collect funds for the Knights of Columbus.
Maybe you wanted to save me the trouble of swimming back.
Come on, Bill. What do you say?
Shall we let Plunkett stay?
All right. All right, but from now on, he's your guinea pig.
- All right. Oh, Bill, there's something else.
- What?
What if you give Captain Mangan an okay to provide buses to take the Jewish boys to Napier.
Sure. I'll take care of that.
You know, it's a good thing there's no Mohammedans in the regiment.
I'd have no time for the war.
Well, it's a fortunate thing you're not a crook.
You could sell the Brooklyn Bridge to the police department.
- Yes?
- Private Plunkett reporting.
The Major sent for me, sir.
Will you see Captain Mangan about those buses now?
Yes, sir.
Plunkett, you're a rotten soldier.
You have no loyalty, no fighting spirit, nothing.
Stand up!
I've been getting more and more fed up with you ever since Camp Mills.
But you jawed so much about getting at the Germans,
I thought getting up to the front might discover something in you.
Well, it didn't!
Beginning with our first night in the trenches you...
- Oh, so Father Duffy talked, huh?
- He didn't have to.
I've got eyes and so has every man in the regiment.
It was the same at Baccarat, Champagne.
In fact, every fight we've been in.
You're quite a scrapper, Plunkett, behind the lines.
Pretty handy with your fists.
Trying to prove how tough you are to a bunch of men who no longer believe you.
Consequently, I've decided to boot you out of the regiment,
- transfer you someplace else.
- Well, if the Major thinks that's best, sir.
I did, and so do you, but Father Duffy didn't.
He believes in you.
That's why you're getting another chance.
But remember this, the first sign of malingering or sloppy soldiering,
Father Duffy nor the Archbishop of Meath won't be able to save you, and it won't be a transfer this time.
Yes, sir.
That's all, Plunkett.
Plunkett!
We're moving up to the attack across the Ourcq River tonight.
It's your chance to redeem yourself and prove that Father Duffy was right.
Now, get going.
Yes, sir.
Hold it! Hold it!
This is as far as we go tonight.
Man the fire-steps end detail outposts and fix up these parapets.
- Yes, sir.
- We'll consolidate here.
- Wynn.
- Yes, sir.
Turn around. I want you to take a message back to Regimental PC.
- Who's there?
- Relax now, Jerry.
It's only Father Duffy making his parish rounds.
Is there anything I can do for you?
No. Just go away and let me alone, will you, Father, please?
No, wait. Don't go. Stay a minute, huh?
You're like the old Irishman who'd rather be quarreling than Ionesome.
A little jumpy, are you? Well, we all are.
The old 69th's been taking it on the chin today, but it's come back to stage a knockout.
- Yes, and you're part of it.
- Part of it?
Ducking into shell holes, going ahead only when I had to, seeing guys I knew torn to pieces and figuring any minute some heinie I can't get my hands on is gonna crack a bullet into me.
Oh, it isn't the fight I mind, Father,
I love a fight and I've never been afraid of anything in my whole life before, but this stuff.
See what a bursting shell can do to human flesh and blood.
It's made me yellow. Me, of all the guys in this whole outfit. Yellow!
Scared is the word, Jerry. Not yellow.
- And you'll get over it.
- Get over it.
When everywhere I go, and everything I do,
I see the faces of Casey and O'Keefe and Lieutenant Wynn and all those guys I killed up in the dugout in Rouge Bouquet staring at me and saying nothing, just hoping I'll get mine.
I can't fight it anymore. I've tried.
Goes along for a while, everything's okay and then suddenly it hits until I feel as though if I don't get up and run away I'll go nuts.
And I'd be out of this by now if you hadn't stopped my transfer.
It's not for me to say, Jerry, that's nonsense.
It isn't.
But Jerry, there's only one way you can lick it.
- That's through faith and prayer.
- Faith.
Listen to those bullets.
Can faith stop them?
If a guy gets his pins blown off, will prayer put them back on again, or bring the dead back to life?
No, but faith and prayer can help you defeat the fear that's possessing you.
Oh, Jerry, it's peace and courage
I'm offering you.
If you'd only open up your heart and take it.
- Father Duffy, come quickly!
- All right.
Think it over now, Jerry.
Ask the Lord to help you.
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- No, there's nothing you can do.
Major Donovan.
It's from headquarters.
Air reconnaissance reports an enemy patrol moving out to occupy the far edge of the Colas woods.
We'll send out a patrol, intercept them and bring in prisoners.
- Very good, sir.
- No, not you yet.
Lieutenant Ames and I will go forward and size them up.
- You'll follow up with the patrol.
- Yes, sir.
I need 10 men to follow up with Sergeant Kilmer.
It's a dangerous mission.
Who wants to volunteer?
- I'll go, sir.
- Good.
- Take me, sir.
- Okay, sir.
- Sure thing, sir.
- Count me in.
- Okay, with me, sir.
- Not without me, you won't.
Okay.
Thanks, Plunkett!
Give me five minutes' start.
Then arrange for a combat patrol to go forward in charge of Sergeant Wynn.
Yes, sir. Watch yourself
- Listen, Sarge...
- Quiet.
Why don't we wait here with Big Mike and the rest of them?
Pull yourself together.
The Major's up there.
We can't let him down.
Sarge, let me go back and see if Big Mike and...
Shut up, you fool. If you start yelping now, you'll get us all killed.
Well, then why don't we wait for the rest of them?
Let go of me.
I want to get out of here!
I don't want to stay here and be killed!
Let go of me!
Wynn! McManus! Come here!
- Hey, come back here!
- Wait a minute! Come back here!
- What's the matter with you?
- They're all killed up there!
- Donovan, Ames, all of them!
- And you're the only survivor?
- Yeah.
- Where's your rifle?
- I... I...
- Why, you...
Look out!
Take care of these prisoners and retire to cover!
Come on, sauerkraut, get up.
Get down!
Get them down! Get down! Get down!
Get them down.
Hold on, Major! We're on our way!
- Go ahead, step on it.
- Go ahead, sauerkraut. Hurry up.
- Mission accomplished, sir.
- Nice work.
We'll dig in here. Now that we've got the wood, we'll hold them.
Run back and get B company up here.
My PC will be right here.
Yes, sir.
Who yelled back there and upset the apple cart?
I wouldn't know, sir.
- It was Plunkett, sir.
- Plunkett?
- Is he killed?
- No, sir. I fumbled my chance, sir.
Never mind. I'll take care of him later.
Battalion attention!
Eyes right! Eyes right!
I don't know what these guys are so cheerful about.
Believe me, in the next war, there's gonna be three guys missing.
Me and the two guys that's chasing me.
This is the toughest spot we've ever been in.
Is it true you're going to attack in the Argonne without artillery preparation?
- It is.
- What's headquarters thinking of?
The element of surprise.
Regardless of the fact that it'll probably cost us 60% casualties.
Well, orders are orders.
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye, Major.
Well, I'll be seeing you up there after you get underway.
Oh, by the way, Bill,
- were you able to do anything for...
- Plunkett?
No, nothing. Not even if I could.
But Bill, that's so unfair.
As I told the court-martial, it was all my fault.
If I hadn't changed his transfer, it never would have happened.
He shouldn't be executed for something he couldn't help.
Now, look, Father, let's don't go into this thing again.
I know what you're going to say.
There's a weakling in every outfit, but never in history has a 69th man disgraced his regiment like Plunkett.
Tomorrow morning at 7:00, he's going to get exactly what's coming to him and may God have mercy on his soul.
Is there anything I can do for you, Jerry?
What can you do for me?
This is curtains, ain't it?
Well, there's still time to make your peace.
Don't stand there talking like a sap.
Don't you understand, they're gonna shoot me.
Tomorrow morning I get it.
If you're so hot to help me, do something about that.
I've tried, Jerry. Believe me, I have.
I've gone to the Colonel, to general headquarters.
Told them it was all my fault and not yours.
Looks like there's no use.
There's nothing left for me to do.
Do you really believe it's because of you
I'm in this jam?
- I do indeed.
- It's not my fault I couldn't take it, is it?
Jerry, you're not the only one in the regiment who ever knew fear.
It just happened you couldn't face it, that's all.
Well, you can still do something.
Let me out of here. Help me to escape.
Look, you just said they had no right to keep me here.
Let me out. I'll get home some way and after the war they'll forget all about me.
Why not? You're a priest.
They can't do anything to you.
Jerry, you're forgetting
I'm a soldier as well as a priest.
Yeah. I see.
Jerry, ask me anything else.
I will. I'll ask you to beat it.
- But you don't...
- Oh, let me alone!
Please.
- Hello, Alec. How is it?
- For a mass suicide, the set-up's great.
A thick belt of uncut wire with strong enemy machine gun positions behind it.
If they'd given us artillery preparation, we could have blasted lanes through that wire.
- What about tanks? Do we get them?
- Sure.
After we take the two villages beyond.
A sweet job that will be.
We'll be cut to pieces from that hill before we get well started.
- Why the devil are they ordering...
- Ever read Tennyson, Alec?
"Ours not to reason why
Ours is but to do and..."
- You said it. Zero hour the same?
- Just before dawn, 4:45.
Reception committee is tuning up.
I'd better get back to my battalion.
Good luck.
- Well, Mike.
- Hello, Father.
How do you feel now?
Now, don't be like that.
It takes more than a.77 shell to keep an Irishman down.
I'm on me way out, Father.
Could you maybe just say a bit of a prayer?
Wouldn't you be wanting one of your own faith?
No time.
- You mean you want me to help you pray?
- Yes, Father.
'Tis the only thing that's kept me going for many a long day.
"O Lord God, I know that my life and my death are in thy hands.
"May it be thy will to heal me.
"But if thou willest my death, may it be atonement for all my sins.
"Into thy hands I entrust my spirit.
"Thou art my redeemer, Lord God of Truth.
"The Lord shall reign forever and ever.
Hear, O Israel.
"The Lord our God, the Lord is one."
Thank you, Father.
Don't tell me they're starting to shell this place?
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!
Jerry!
- We're getting out of here!
- Where'll we go?
What are you gonna do with me?
Jerry, you've looked in the face of death these past few hours.
Death by execution and death from shellfire.
Now, you're still alive.
I can't let you stay here with this.
You're free, Jerry.
Free of everything but yourself.
Now, I can't tell you what to do.
I can only point out two roads to you.
One to safety for awhile. Perhaps to home.
The other... Do you hear that?
It's falling on your regiment, Jerry.
They're in a trap.
It's possible not one of them will come out alive.
There are your two ways. Whichever you choose, you'll have to walk alone.
What do you mean, whichever I choose?
Do you think I'm crazy enough to try and go through that?
Goodbye, Father.
Jerry! Jerry!
Give me a hand here.
Don't go in there, Father!
That whole roof might cave in any minute!
Father Duffy!
Boys! Boys! Boys!
Everything's going to be all right.
This is Father Duffy.
Oh, aren't you ashamed?
Kicking up a row like this over a few shells?
Timmy, lad, I'm surprised.
Do you want Almighty God to think you've forgotten him?
Come on, now, Sean, buck up.
Buck up, all of you.
Believe me, I tell you, everything is gonna be all right.
Get hold of yourself now, Timmy.
Come on, now.
We'll all say the Lord's Prayer.
Repeat after me.
- Our Father who art in heaven.
- Our Father who art in heaven.
- Hallowed be thy name.
- Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses.
Forgive us our trespasses.
As we forgive those who trespass against us.
As we forgive those who trespass against us.
- Lead us not into temptation.
- Lead us not into temptation.
- But deliver us from evil.
- But deliver us from evil.
Amen.
Thank you, Father.
And if it so be that he find it, yea men, I say to you, he rejoiceth more for that than for the ninety-nine which went not astray.
Them things is getting on my nerves.
Give me a cigarette, will you, mac?
- What for? You can't smoke up here.
- I don't want to smoke it.
I want to chew it to keep my teeth from chattering.
Hang on, men.
The tanks will be here soon.
Hey, Paddy, watch those big ears of yours.
They'll think you're a battleship.
How'd you boys like a nice cold bottle of beer?
I'd settle for a hot one.
Hey, Brian, wait till the wife hears you've been out all night.
Sorry, old-timer.
- It looks kind of mean, Alec.
- Kind of?
With all that around us, and that wire out there, we're cooked, Bill,
- unless we get through.
- Well, we've got to get through.
Once we get into their trenches, we can finish the thing off.
Well, here's a scrap that should satisfy even the fighting Irish, eh, Sergeant?
Yes, sir, 'tis a fine bit of a scrimmage, sir.
We've got to knock out those machine guns somehow, cut a hole through that wire.
Are all those Stokes mortars out of commission?
Yes, sir. And the crew's all killed, sir.
Maybe there's one we could fix up somehow. That would do it.
Well, there's Scanlon's outfit about 50 yards off the flank there,
- so maybe I could have a look, sir.
- Go ahead.
Come on, you men!
What're you doing up here with fighting men?
Did you run the wrong way again?
I didn't come here to look at your big, ugly puss. Now shut up!
- Show me how to use this stovepipe.
- What for?
So you can turn it on the 69th and kill off a few more good men like Tim and Kilmer?
Listen, I know what you think of me and I know what I think of you, but never mind our own private scrap.
I'll give you a belly full of that later.
Now, shut your big Irish trap and show me how to use this Stokes!
If you don't,
I'll shove this bayonet right through you!
You show me how to use it, so I can't miss.
There's nothing to it. Here.
Put your hand on the fuse.
Pull the pin. Drop it in!
They don't look like much.
Enough TNT in them shells to blow a lane in that wire as wide as Central Park.
Here's a kiss for you, heinie!
- Are you all right?
- All right?
- I'll show them krauts. Can you walk?
- I guess so. Why?
Grab some men and get this ammunition forward.
Hey! You 69th men!
Grab these shells and move up!
Put a sausage skin on this one, you krauts!
Here's one for the 69th!
- Who's firing that Stokes?
- Big Mike.
Here's one from Brooklyn!
If he can keep that up, he'll blow a hole in that wire big enough to sail the Leviathan through.
Here's one for Yonkers and the Bronx!
Divide it among you!
Here's one for you, pal!
And another one!
Look out, Mike!
Now, Alec.
Mike! Mike!
God bless you!
You've saved the day for us!
They're swarming up and over and through.
- Man, what a fight you made.
- What a fight I made, Major?
- There's the man who made it. Not me.
- It's not Plunkett?
It is, sir.
I'm sorry, soldier.
Father Duffy.
Father Duffy.
Jerry, this is Father Duffy.
I just been talking to your boss.
- You're not afraid, are you, Jerry?
- No, Father.
Not anymore.
I been an awful lot of trouble to you, haven't I, Father?
Father, who's that with you?
Major Donovan, Big Mike.
Mike?
I'm awful sorry about Tim.
I'm ready, Father.
I once thought this man was a coward.
A coward, sir?
From now on, every time I hear the name of Plunkett,
I'll snap to attention and salute.
Pretty soft for you colonels.
- My feet are killing me.
- You see? You should be wounded.
Then they'd be cheering you, too.
Where was you wounded, buddy?
- Hoboken.
- Hoboken?
Yeah. I sprained me ankle getting off the boat.
Say, this is fine.
O heavenly Father, here I beseech you the prayer of this, America's lost generation.
They loved life, too, O Lord.
It was as sweet to them as to the living of today.
They accepted privation, wounds and death, that an ideal might live.
Don't let it be forgotten, Father.
Amid turmoil and angry passions, when all worthwhile things seem swept away, let the tired eyes of a troubled world rise up and see the shining citadel of which these young lives formed the imperishable stones.
America, the citadel of peace, peace forevermore.
This I beg of you through Christ, our Lord.
Amen.

MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
WELL, I ONLY WANT
YOUR HAPPINESS, LUTIE.
AND I JUST KEEP THINKING
ONE THING:
JIM BREWTON IS ALL RIGHT.
HE'S GREAT IN SALT FORK
TERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO
AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.
STOP IT, DARLING.
AND THEN I THINK OF
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER,
AND NEITHER PLACE-
I KNOW IT'S GOING
TO BE RIGHT.
AND, LUTIE, SUCH A
A SHORT COURTSHIP.
A COWMAN!
BUT SUCH A COWMAN.
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN YOU INTRODUCED US.
THAT'S RIGHT,
I DID INTRODUCE YOU.
HERE'S A TELEGRAM
FOR YOU.
OH, THANKS.
IT'S PROBABLY FROM HIM.
HE MUST HAVE LEFT.
HE SAID HE'D WIRE

WELL!
FATHER, THIS IS NOT FUNNY.
WELL, YOU ASKED ME
TO SMILE, DIDN'T YOU?
YOU DONE IT-
TRAIN'S EARLY, 3/4 OF AN HOUR!
AND 33 SECONDS.
I GOT A STOPWATCH.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
IF SAM DOESN'T MEET YOU?
DON'T WORRY.
YOU HEARD THE CONDUCTOR-
TRAIN'S EARLY.
YOUR MAN AIN'T
SHOWED UP, NEITHER.
SAMMY!
SAMMY!
- SELINA!
HELLO, SPROUT.
YOU'VE GROWED!
REGULAR BUSTER,
AIN'T SHE?
SAM, THIS IS
LUTIE CAMERON.
WE KEPT EACH OTHER COMPANY
ON THE ROAD OUT.
SHE SPELLED ME WITH MOLLY.
HAPPY TO KNOW YOU, SAM.
I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU.
NO MORE THAN I HEARD
OF HER MAN.
MAYBE I KNOW HIM.
HOMESTEADER?
CATTLEMAN.
- OH.
NAME OF JIM BREWTON.
COLONEL BREWTON?
- MM-HMM.
YES, I KNOW HIM.
I SURE THANK YOU FOR HELPING
THE WIFE OUT, MA'AM.
COME ON, HONEY.

GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER.

BUTTON-NOSE.

THANK YOU.
COLONE BREWTON WILL

YES, MA'AM.
I'M SORRY
TO DISTURB YOU
BUT WILL YOU
HELP ME, PLEASE?
OH, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
I'LL BE A SON OF A GUN.
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
I SAID,
I'M A SON OF A GUN.
IT ISN'T POSSIBLE. OF COURSE NOW,
IS IT? - WHAT?
THAT YOU ARE MISS LUTIE CAMERON
OF ST. LOUIS AND POINTS EAST.
SHE ARRIVES ON THE 3:00.
THEY'RE SENDING UP
ROCKETS THEN.
THE TRAIN WAS EARLY.
TRUST JIM BREWTON
TO PICK A WOMAN
WITH HAIR THE COLOR
OF CHILI PEPPER.
WELL, DON'T WORRY,
I LIKE IT.
WELL, IF YOU KNOW COLONEL
BREWTON, YOU CAN HELP ME.
EVERYBODY KNOWS JIM BREWTON,
SOME TO THEIR SORROW.
YOUR IMPENDING ARRIVAL
HAS CREATED QUITE A STIR
IN SALT FORK,
MISS CAMERON.
BREATHS HAVE BEEN
WELL-BATED.
I SHALL NOW BATE MINE AGAIN.
YOU'RE MAKING THE MISTAKE
OF YOUR LIFE, YOU KNOW.
THERE'S A TRAIN OUT
OF HERE TOMORROW.
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D BE ON IT.
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?
THE NAME'S BRICE CHAMBERLAIN.
HOWEVER, "WHAT," NOT "WHO,"
IS THE IMPORTANT THING.
I, MISS CAMERON,
AM AN IDEALIST-
A PRACTICING IDEALIST.
LOOK AROUND YOU,
MISS CAMERON.
YOU'RE OUT OF PLACE.
THE WINE OF THE COW COUNTRY
IS REDEYE, NOT CHAMPAGNE.
REDEYE...
- REDEYE.
A VERY INFERIOR
BRAND OF WHISKEY.
NEVER TOUCH
THE STUFF MYSELF.
UNDERSTAND BREWTON
DOES, THOUGH.
I SHOULD BE VERY ANGRY.
I GUESS I AM.
ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE I'M NOT.
I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS SUCH
A PLACE.
COME ON, MR. CHAMBERLAIN,
JURY'S COMING IN.
WE BETTER GET OVER THERE.
BREWTON AIN'T SHOWED UP YET.
SURE, ANDY. MEET YOU
AT THE COURTHOUSE.
IS THAT WHERE COLONEL BREWTON IS,
AT THE COURTHOUSE?
THAT'S WHERE I LEFT HIM.
WHY, YOU'RE HIS ENEMY,
AREN'T YOU?
HIS NATURAL ENEMY.
WE'RE MAKING HISTORY IN SALT FORK
TODAY, MISS CAMERON.
I HOPE IT WILL BE
THE RIGHT KIND.
IF BREWTON HAS HIS WAY
IT WON'T BE.
QUIET DOWN, FOLKS,
QUIET DOWN!
QUIET IN THE COURTHOUSE, BOYS.
THE COURT'S IN SESSION NOW.
GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY
HAV E YOU REACHED A DECISION?
YES, SIR, WE HAVE-
UNANIMOUS.
HOW FIND YOU?
ARE THE DEFENDANTS GUILTY
OR NOT GUILTY?
WE FIND THAT
ANDY BOGGS HERE
WAS SHOT AND RUN OFF
THE LAND HE FILED ON
BY PARTIES UNKNOWN.
WELL, THAT VERDICT
DON'T SETTLE ANYTHING.
HOW ABOUT
THE DEFENDANTS HERE-
IKE RANDALL
AND BILL ROACH?
YOU MEAN, THE BOYS
WHAT DONE THE SHOOTIN'?
THEY AIN'T GUILTY.
DEFENDANTS RELEASED.
COURT'S ADJOURNED!
JUST ONE MOMENT,
GENTLEMEN!
THIS TRIAL'S OVER, BUT AS
ATTORNEY FOR THE PLAINTIFFS,
THERE ARE STILL A FEW
THINGS STICKING IN MY CRAW.
SWALLOW QUICK,
AND MAYBE THEY'LL GO AWAY.
COLONEL BREWTON, I WONDER,
NOW THAT WE'VE LOST
IF YOU'D OBLIGE ME
BY ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS.
LET'S SAY, AS A SPORTING
PROPOSITION.
TROUBLE WITH YOU IS,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LICKED.
NO, HE DOESN'T, MAC.
WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE HIM THAT.
ALL RIGHT, SIR
GO AHEAD.
JUST REMEMBER, I'VE GOT A
3 O'CLOCK TRAIN TO MEET.
THANK YOU,
I'LL BE BRIEF.
COLONEL BREWTON,
HOW MUCH CATTLE RANGE DO YOU CONTROL?
I'VE HEARD IT RUNS
INTO A MILLION OR MORE ACRES.
I'VE NEVER COUNTED THEM.
THEN AGAIN, I'VE HEARD
THAT IT'S 100 SQUARE MILES.
IN ANY CASE YOU WILL ADMIT
THAT'S A LOT OF LAND FOR ONE MAN.
WELL, I RUN A LOT OF COWS.
IS IT TRUE THAT OF THIS
VAST AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
YOU ACTUALLY OWN ONLY
A FEW SCATTERED WATER HOLES
THAT ARE FILED ON
EITHER IN YOUR NAME
OR THOSE OF YOUR MEN?
AND THAT BY FAR
THE GREATER PART OF IT
STILL BELONGS
TO THE GOVERNMENT.
LEGALLY, YES.
IS IT TRUE, THEN THAT
MILLION OR MORE ACRES
STILL BELONGING
TO THE GOVERNMENT,
IS THE SAME LAND FROM
WHICH ANDREW BOGGS
WHO MERELY WANTED 160 ACRES
FOR A HOMESTEAD.
WAS RUN OFF AND
SEVERELY WOUNDED
BY PARTIES UNKNOWN.
BOGGS WAS NOT
RUN OFF BECAUSE
HE WANTED TO SETTLE
THE 160 ACRES
BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT
HE WANTED TO DO WITH THE LAND.
LET'S FORGET
ABOUT THIS CASE.
ANDREW BOGGS IS ONLY
A SINGLE MAN,
AND THE COURT HAS
ALREADY DISPOSED OF HIM.
BUT WAITING AT
THE EDGE OF SALT FORK
TO HEAR THE OUTCOME OF THIS TRIAL
ARE OTHER SETTLERS.
MEN WITH FAMILIES,
WHO'VE DRIVEN THEIR WAGONS
MORE THAN 1,000 MILES
ACROSS THE PLAINS
AND LEFT THEIR DEAD
FROM THE MISSISSIPPI
TO THE RIO GRANDE
ALL WITH ONE PURPOSE-
TO FIND HOMES
FOR THEMSELVES IN THIS GREAT TERRITORY.
I WANT TO ASK IN THE NAMES
OF THESE FAMILIES
IF YOU WON'T LET THEM SETTLE
UNDISTURBED ON A FEW ACRES
OUT OF THE MILLIONS OR MORE
OF GOVERNMENT LAND ON YOUR RANGE.
CHAMBERLAIN, I HAVE SYMPATHY
FOR THE EARLY PIONEER
WHO CAME OUT HERE
AND RISKED HIS LIFE
AND HIS FAMILY'S
AMONG THE INDIANS,
AND I HOPE I HAVE A LITTLE CHARITY
FOR THE NESTOR
WHO WAITED UNTIL THE COUNTRY
WAS SAFE AND PEACEABLE
BEFORE HE FILED HIS HOMESTEAD
ON THE RANGE
OF SOMEONE ELSE WHO
HAD FOUGHT FOR IT.
BUT WHEN THAT NESTOR PICKS
LAND LIKE MY BIG VEGA,
WHICH IS 7000 FEET ABOVE THE SEA
WHICH WAS NATURALLY
INTENDED FOR
GRAZING LAND, AND ALWAYS WILL
BE GRAZING LAND,
WHEN HE WANT TO PLOW IT UP
TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY
WHERE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH RAIN
FOR THE CROPS TO GROW,
WHEN HE ONLY KILLS
THE GRASS THAT WILL GROW,
AND THEN, WHEN HIS CROPS
STARVE FOR WATER,
SUPPORTS HIS FAMILY
BY KILLING MY BEEF,
AND BECOMES A MAN WITHOUT
RESPECT TO HIMSELF
AND A MENACE
TO THE TERRITORY,
THEN I HAVE NEITHER SYMPATHY
NOR CHARITY.
AND IF I KNOW THE TEMPER
OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE
WHAT ANDY BOGGS GOT
IS JUST A SAMPLE OF
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF OTHERS
TRY IT.
THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS
NO JUSTICE HERE
AND THAT YOU DOMINATED
THE COUNTRY.
THEY WERE RIGHT.
WELL, WE WON, JIM.
BOYS, I'VE GOT A TRAIN TO MEET.
JIM! JIM!
JIM!
PARDON, PARDON.
JIM, THE TRAIN
BROKE A RECORD.
I'LL MAKE UP FOR THAT LATER.
OH, I WANT YOU TO MEET A FRIEND
OF MINE, DOC REID.
HOW DO YOU DO?
- THIS IS JUDGE WHITE.
HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO?
FLOYD McCURTIN.
HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO?
WELL, WE WON, DIDN'T WE?
WHATEVER IT WAS.
WE HAD TO.
DID WE, JIM?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
WE WON TODAY,
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE
THAT BEAT LOOK
IN ANDY BOGGS' EYES.
YOU GET ENOUGH MEN LOOKING
LIKE THAT..
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
WHAT I SEE COMING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
OH, THE DOC-
HE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
YOU'LL GET TO KNOW THE DOC.
I HOPE I GET TO KNOW ALL
OF YOU.
AND THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO LIKE ME
AS WELL AS I'M GOING
TO LIKE YOU.
THERE YOU ARE, BOYS,
DO YOU SEE NOW WHY I DID IT?
SURE DO. BUT NOW WE'RE WONDERING
WHY YOU WAITED SO LONG.
COME ON.
SUCH A HURRY, JIM.
6:00 IN THE MORNING.
COME ON. YOU'LL BE THE FIRST WOMAN
IN THE TERRITORY
EVER MARRIED IN HER SLEEP.
WE MADE IT.
WHAT DID WE MAKE, JIM?
WHERE ARE WE?
THE GREATEST PLACE I KNOW.
COME ON.
THERE IT IS.
IT'S ALL GRASS.
YEAH.
WELL, IT'S JUST...
IT'S SO EMPTY,
SO QUIET.
QUIET?
MORE NOISE OUT THERE
THAN THERE IS IN ST. LOUIS.
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
WELL, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN FOR IT
BEFORE YOU CAN.
I'M LISTENING, JIM.
ALL I HEAR IS THAT LITTLE
WHISTLE OF A SOUND.
THE WIND?
THERE'S A LOT MORE
THAN THAT OUT THERE.
TELL ME, JIM-WHAT?
WELL...
NO, PLEASE TELL ME.
I'LL TRY TO UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DO YOU HEAR
OUT THERE?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I GUESS I HEAR THE BUFFALO.
BUFFALO? BUT THEY AREN'T
THERE ANYMORE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
OH. WHAT ELSE, JIM?i
INDIANS.
GONE, TOO?
HERDED INTO
A RESERVATION.
I CAN REMEMBER THE FIRST
TIME I SAW HER.
WE'D COME A LONG WAY
AND NOBODY WAS TELLING US
ABOUT ANY SURPRISES, EITHER.
WE JUST CAME OVER THE HILL
AND THERE SHE WAS
SORT OF LYING THERE ALL ALONE.
NOBODY WANTED HER THEN...
EXCEPT THE ANTELOPE AND THE BUFFALO
AND THE INDIANS.
SO WE TOOK HER, AND WE SET HER UP
RIGHT FOR COW COUNTRY.
WE FOUGHT FOR HER.
OUR BLOOD'S SUNK
IN EVERY MILE.
INDIAN BLOOD, TOO.
I'M NOT SO PROUD
OF SOME OF THAT.
MY BROTHER'S OUT THERE.
I SUPPOSE I SOUNDED HARD
TO YOU BACK AT THE TRIAL
AND TO EVERYBODY ELSE.
AND I SUPPOSE IT'S HARD
TO UNDERSTAND
THAT ALL THAT OUT THERE
IS ANYTHING BUT JUST A LOT OF GRASS
MADE TO ORDER
FOR FARMING.
YES, I SUPPOSE IT IS
JUST GRASS TO MOST.
BUT NOT TO YOU, JIM?
TO ME, IT'S LAND THE WAY GOD
MADE IT
AND WANTS IT TO STAY.
AND I MAY BE WRONG
BUT I'VE GOT A HUNCH
THAT HE WANTS ME TO HELP
HIM KEEP IT THAT WAY.
I KNOW IT'S TOO SOON TO EXPECT
YOU TO SEE IT THAT WAY, LUTIE
BUT YOU WILL
SEE IT SOME DAY.
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT.
I WANT TO, JIM.
WELL, THERE SHE IS.
THE RANCH.
AND A HOUSE.
HURRY, JIM.
IT'S BETTER INSIDE.
YOU BRING MY SHORTENING?
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING
BETTER THAN SHORTENING.
HERE IT IS.
JEFF, OUR COOK.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF
RIGHT NOW, JEFF?
I'M THINKING OF
MY SHORTENING.
BANTY, COME HERE.
THIS IS BANTY OUR HORSE WRANGLER.
HOW ARE YOU, BANTY?
I'M FINE, MA'AM.
YOU'RE WELCOME, MA'AM.
THANK YOU. THAT'S A WONDERFUL
WORD, "WELCOME."
GET THOSE BAGS
WILL YOU, JEFF?
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU
THE LAYOUT.
FINE. CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THE KITCHEN.
SHE'S SURE NICE
TO LOOK AT.
SHE BETTER KEEP OUT
OF MY KITCHEN.
AND YOU CAN TAKE THEM BAGS IN.
MY...
THIS WILL FIX UP NICELY.
THE STOREROOM?
NO, NO, THIS IS THE PARLOR.
THE LIVING ROOM.
WHO LIVES IN IT,
DEAR?
WELL, NOBODY, REALLY,
VERY MUCH.
YOU SEE, WE'RE NOT
HERE VERY MUCH.
I, UH... I SUPPOSE IF THIS STUFF
WAS MOVED OUT OF HERE,
IT EVENTUALLY WOULD GET
TO LOOK
LIKE A LIVING ROOM,
WOULDN'T IT?
YES, I SUPPOSE IT WOULD.
I WONDER WHY I DIDN'T
HAVE THIS STUFF
MOVED OUT BEFORE YOU CAME?
DO YOU KNOW?
NO, I REALLY DON'T.
WELL, I'LL BE DOGGONE,
NEITHER DO I.
I WANT TO SEE
THE KITCHEN.
IT'S AT THE END
OF THE HALL.
UH, TAKE IT EASY
WITH JEFF.
JUDAS.
MAY I COME IN?
JUST LOOKING AROUND,
I'LL GET RIGHT OUT.
I'D BE MUCH OBLIGED.
LORENZO, I'M WAITING ON THAT CABBAGE.
OH, BISCUITS!
WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE?
LOOK LIKE BISCUITS,
GOOD BISCUITS.
TASTE LIKE THAT, TOO.
NOTHING LIKE SOUR MILK AND A BIG OVEN,
IS THERE, JEFF?
BAKING SODA WENT IN FIRST-
YOU CAN TELL THAT.
SHORTENING IN JUST RIGHT TOO...
AND DOUGH ROLLED
JUST ENOUGH.
JEFF, HOW WOULD
YOU LIKE TO HAVE A DOLLAR
FOR EVERY BISCUIT
YOU'VE MADE?
I'D TAKE A NICKELOF GRASS
AND I'D OWN THE PLACE.
NOT THAT I'D WANT TO.
NOT ANYMORE. NOT NOW.
IT'S TOO CROWDED.
A MAN NEEDS ELBOW ROOM.
I WON'T EVEN COME INSIDE YOUR
KITCHEN UNTIL YOU ASK ME TO,
HONESTLY, I WON'T.
SHE ATE ONE. SHE KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS EATING.
TOUGHER THAN WHANG LEATHER.
SHE CAN LIE FASTER
THAN A DOG CAN TROT.
WAIT! WAS YOU
BRUNG UP IN A BARN?
NOW, LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
NO REACHING,
NOR EATING WITH KNIFES
NOR DRINKING OUT OF SAUCERS.
THIS HERE WOMAN'S
A LADY.
I'M SCARED.
YOU'RE SCARED?
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE BOYS ARE? COME ON.
UP!
LUTIE, THESE ARE THE BOYS.
BOYS, THIS IS
MRS. BREWTON.
HOWDY, MA'AM.
I'M VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU.
THERE.
SIT!
THAT'S YOUR PIECE
RIGHT THERE.
MA'AM...
YES, BANTY?
MRS. BREWTON,
THE BOYS...
WE'VE BEEN
THINKING,
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT
THAT WE CAN DO,
WELL, WE'D ALL-FIRED GLAD TO.
WELL, UM.. THANK YOU, BANTY.
THAT'S NICE.
ANYTHING, MA'AM.
WELL, I, UH... LET'S SEE...
OH. YOU KNOW THOSE TREES
DOWN BY THE BROOK?
BROOK?
CREEK.
- CREEK? CREEK.
I WONDER IF YOU COULD
PULL THEM OUT FOR ME.
WHY, SURE, MA'AM,
IF THEY'RE
BOTHERING YOU ANY
WE CAN THROW A ROPE
AROUND 'EM
AND YANK 'EM OUT
BY THE ROOTS.
OH, NO. NO, I MEANT
COULD YOU DIG THEM UP
AND PLANT THEM AROUND THE HOUSE
SO THAT WE COULD
HAVE SOME SHADE?
IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO FENCE IN
THE WHOLE YARD.
FENCE?
WE'LL DO IT,
MRS. BREWTON-
ALL THE ORNERY
TREES YOU WANT.
WE'LL DO IT.
WON'T WE, BOYS?
UH, SURE WILL.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. BREWTON.
GOOD NIGHT.
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
NO, NO, NO.
YOU SAID "FENCE. THAT'S A CUSSWORD
ON THE OPEN RANGE.
OH, MY!
COLONEL, I JUST BEEN DOWN
AT THE BARN.
PETE SAYS THAT NEW BULL'S BEEN
FIGHTING AGAIN.
- OH?
CUT UP PRETTY BAD.
OH, I'LL GO
RIGHT DOWN.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
WON'T YOU?
I CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE ON
THAT NEW BULL.
JEFF, JUST HOW
IMPORTANT IS A BULL?
WELL, THIS ONE
IS SURE A BEAUTY.
THERE'S A NEIGHBOR.
HUH? WHERE?
THERE.
OH, THAT'S JUST
HEADQUARTERS CAMP.
OH.
WE GOT A NEIGHBOR,
THOUGH.
MCGEE RANCH, LAYS RIGHT OVER
ABOUT 15 MILES.
15 MILES?
IS THERE A MRS. MCGEE?
NO. MCGEE'S
AN OLD BACH.
OH.
WELL...
GOOD NIGHT, JEFF.
LUTIE.
YES, JIM?
HAVE YOU BEEN CRYING?
NO.
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING LIKE CRYING?
NO, JIM.
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN FEELING?
OH, I'VE BEEN...
JUST THINKING.
WHAT ABOUT?
OH, ABOUT... ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
I'M GOING TO DO
HOW I'M GOING TO
FIX UP THE HOUSE.
I'LL GET YOU EVERYTHING
YOU NEED, LUTIE.
YOU'RE SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?
VERY SURE.
LUTIE...
ONLY...
- ONLY WHAT?
ONE THING:
I WISH YOU LOOKED AT ME
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT THAT OUT THERE.
CUT ALL THEM COPPERWOODS
OUT OF THE HERD FIRST
MRS. BREWTON DON'T WANT NO
MIXED BREEDS AT THIS END OF THE RANGE.
JUST YEW AND TAMARIND.
HEY, THIS HERE'S A MAVERICK,
AIN'T IT?
SURE 'TIS. BRAND HER
AND LET HER GO.
COMMENCE PLANTING THEM NOW,
CLEAR AROUND THE HOUSE.
YEAH, LIKE A FENCE!
PAT THE DIRT UP NICE
AROUND THEM ROOTS.
THEY'RE KIND OF SPINDLY.
I'M AFRAID THE FIRST
GOOD WIND
WILL KNOCK 'EM FLATTER
THAN A FLITTER.
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
THEM LITTLE TREES.
THEY'RE SKINNY,
BUT THEY'RE AWFUL STUBBORN.
THANK YOU, BANTY.
I SAW SELINA HALL
IN TOWN YESTERDAY.
SHE'S STILL LIVING IN THAT LEAN-TO
BEHIND THE SALOON.
SHOULD'VE LEFT WHEN
THE OTHER SQUATTERS DID.
SHE'S TAKING IN WASHING NOW.
THE WATER'S LIKE LYE
HER HANDS WERE BLEEDING.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HER MAN?
THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOBS IN SALT FORK
IF A MAN WANTS TO WORK.
OH, HE'S WORKING
IN THE SALOON.
HE SMELLS EXACTLY
LIKE BEER.
JIM, SAM HALL'S A FARMER.
HE'S NOT A MAN TO BE
SMELLING OF BEER.
AND SELINA HAS TO CARRY ALL
THE WATER SHE USES FOR BLOCKS.
WELL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO FIND
MUCH WATER AROUND A SALOON.
OH, JIM.
SHE'S HAVING ANOTHER ONE,
YOU KNOW.
HUSBAND?
BABY.
OH.
SHE CAN'T HAVE IT IN THAT LEAN-TO
BEHIND THE SALOON.
SELINA SAYS THEY'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT FILING
ON A SPOT NEAR
MULE CREEK FLAT.
RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY HEADQUARTERS RANGE.
YES. NICE AND CLOSE
TO US, ISN'T?
WHAT IS NICE ABOUT
BEING CLOSE?
JIM, SELINA'S MY FRIEND.
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
I'VE GOT OUT HERE.
SHE'D BE A NEIGHBOR.
YOUR WORK TAKES YOU AWAY
SO MUCH.
I'M NOT COMPLAINING, DARLING.
BUT SHE'D BE SOMEONE
TO TALK TO.
WOMEN LIKE
TO TALK A LOT.
YES, I KNOW.
NO, THANKS.
THEY COULD BE SETTLED
BEFORE THE BABY COMES.
THAT'LL BE IN APRIL.
I'LL HAVE MINE IN MAY.
YOU'LL WHAT?
HAVE YOU SEEN DOC REID?
MM-HMM.
LUTIE!
GOOD GIRL, LUTIE
GOOD BOY, JIM.
SELINA SAYS SHE WANTS A BOY.
I'LL BUY YOU A WHOLE FLOOR OF THE BEST
HOSPITAL IN DENVER.
WHAT FOR? HOME'S THE PLACE
TO HAVE A BABY.
WONDER WHERE SELINA
WILL HAVE HERS.
OUT UNDER A BUSH SOMEWHERE,
I SUPPOSE.
I HAVE A HUNCH IT'S GOING
TO BE SOMEWHERE ON MULE CREEK FLAT.
OH, JIM! YOU'LL LIKE THE HALLS
WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW THEM.
I DON'T EXPECT TO GET TO
KNOW THEM.
WHY?
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL
BE HERE LONG ENOUGH.
DON'T BE CRUEL, JIM.
I WON'T HAVE TO. THE COUNTRY HERE
TAKES CARE OF ITSELF, LUTIE.
I DON'T KNOW JUST HOW
IT WILL HAPPEN,
BUT I'LL GIVE THEM
ABOUT 6 MONTHS.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
FIND OUT ALL THAT
FOR YOURSELF,
AREN'T YOU?
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
TELL THEM TO FILE,
AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE HERE,
I'LL BE NICE TO THEM.
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH,
COLONEL BREWTON.
KIND OF TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF ME
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU,
MRS. BREWTON?
THAT'S WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IS FOR.
THIS KiD BETTER LOOK LIKE YOU,
OR I'LL DROWN IT.
HI!
HELLO, SELINA! WHOA.
WE'RE GETTING A SOD HOUSE UP.
WHAT A COUNTRY-
MAN NEEDS A HOUSE,
HE JUST DIGS IT
OUT OF THE GROUND.
YES, QUITE A COUNTRY
AND GETTING BETTER.
WHY, MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
MRS. BREWTON.
SAY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU FOLKS
WAS ACQUAINTED.
OH, YES. MR. CHAMBERLAIN
IS AN OLD, OLD FRIEND AND ADVISOR.
DID HE ADVISE YOU TOO, SELINA?
SHOWED US HOW TO
FILE ON THIS LAND,
IF YOU CALL THAT ADVISING.
I BROUGHT A PRESENT FOR LITTLE MOLLY.
HIS NAME IS
REDEYE SON-OF-A-GUN.
HERE, MOLLY. HERE'S
A PRESENT FOR YOU.
I HOPE YOU CAN USE ALL THAT
STUFF, SELINA.
WHY, HONEY, I CAN USE ANYTHING
FROM A BUTTONHOOK TO
A KITCHEN RANGE.
COLONEL BREWTON SENT US OVER
A SIDE OF BEEF.
THIS BUFFALO GRASS SURE
GOES DOWN DEEP.
HELLO, SAM!s
I'D FEEL A LOT EASIER IF YOU'D TAKE
THAT BEEF BACK, MRS. BREWTON.
WE DON'T NEED IT.
SHUT UP SAM,
SURE WE NEED IT.
WELL, MAYBE WE DO-
FOR EATING PURPOSES.
BUT I'D SURE CHOKE ON IT
IF I FIGURED TAKING IT
GAVE ANYBODY
ANY WRONG IDEAS.
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE
GOT A RIGHT TO BE HERE.
NOBODY'S LETTING US
DO ANYTHING.
WE'RE JUST DOING IT AND
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES.
I KNOW THAT, SAM.
YOU WANT LUTIE TO FEEL
SHE AIN'T WELCOME?
THAT AIN'T WHAT I MEAN,
AND YOU KNOW IT.
YOU WANT TO COME TO SEE MY WIFE
HERE ON OUR PLACE,
YOU COME, AND MOST WELCOME,
MRS. BREWTON.
THANK YOU, SAM.
DON'T TAKE SAM
SERIOUS.
HE'S JUST BEING A MAN.
I KNOW. THEY'RE RATHER PECULIAR PEOPLE
SOMETIMES, AREN'T THEY?
SOMETIMES?!
YOU KNOW, I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.
WHEN YOU FIRST DROVE UP TODAY,
I THOUGHT
"HERE COMES
LADY BOUNTIFUL."
I TAKE IT BACK. YOU'RE REALLY
FOND OF SAM AND SELINA HALL.
SELINA WAS MY FIRST FRIEND OUT HERE.
I'M AWFULLY GLAD SHE DOESN'T
SEEM LONELY.
DID YOU EXPECT HER TO BE?
WELL, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR IT.
HARDLY A WOMAN'COUNTRY.
IT COULD BE.
IT SHOULD BE,
AND SOMEDAY IT WILL.
WHEN? HOW?
WHY NOT? IT'S HAPPENED
IN OTHER PLACES.
FIRST THE COVERED WAGONS,
THEN THE HOUSES,
THEN THE FARMS-FAMILIES,
CHILDREN GROWING UP.
SURE, IT WILL BE A WOMAN'S COUNTRY THEN.
WOMEN WILL HELP
MAKE IT THEIRS.
DO YOU HEAR THAT,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN?
THE HEAR IT?
THE PEOPLE, I MEAN,
OUT THERE.
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
SELINAS AND SAMS
REALLY, ISN'T IT?
COLONEL BREWTON HEARS SOMETHING
SO DIFFERENT.
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE GOT ME WRONG.
I DON'T HEAR ANY VOICES.
I ONLY KNOW THIS IS GOOD LAND
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
UNLESS PEOPLE GET
THEIR LIVING OUT IT.
USE IT, LIVE ON IT.
THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.
ANYWAY, I'LL MAKE
A STAB AT IT.
I TURN BACK HERE.
MAYBE THEN, THIS WOULD BE
MY COUNTRY TOO.
AND YOU-
WHAT DO YOU HEAR?
I'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT A GOOD WIFE
HEARS ONLY WHAT HER HUSBAND
WANTS HER TO HEAR.
WELL, WHAT AN OLD-FASHIONED IDEA.
DON'T BE UNFAIR,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
YOU MUST ADMIT THAT
COLONEL BREWTON'S
MADE IT EASY
FOR SELINA AND SAM.
ONE SIDE OF BEEF?
CONSCIENCE MONEY.
YOU ARE UNFAIR.
I'M REALISTIC. DON'T FORGET
IT'S ONLY ONE SAM, ONE SELINA
AND ONE SIDE OF BEEF.
YOU SPEAK OF THOUSANDS.
I'M WONDERING WHY
BREWTON EVEN HELPED ONE.
HE'S A PIRATE, YOU KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM,
THAT'S ALL. I DO.
WHY DO WOMEN INSIST ON LOVING MEN
FOR WHAT THEY WANT THEM TO BE
INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY ARE?
GOOD DAY, MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
YOU KNOW, I ENVY BREWTON
VERY MUCH.
YOU MEAN, YOU ENVY
THE PIRATE HIS LOOT?
NOT ALL OF IT.
JUST ONE THING.
I'LL GET AROUND TO TELLING YOU
WHAT IT IS SOME DAY.
COME NOW, MR. CHAMBERLAIN,
I'M NOT A CHILD.
I DISLIKE THIS
SCURRYING ABOUT.
IF YOU THINK I'M ATTRACTIVE, WHY DON'T
YOU SAY SO AND GET IT OVER WITH.
THAT ISN'T WHAT I MEANT,
BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT
YOU ARE ATTRACTIVE.
YOU'RE VERYATTRACTIVE.
I KNOW IT, AND YOU KNOW
I KNOW IT.
YOU'VE KNOWN IT
SINCE THE FIRST TIME I LOOKED AT YOU.
YES, I-I HAVE MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
AND NOW YOU'VE SAID IT
AND WE'RE DONE WITH IT.
ARE WE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
THE COMPANY'S ALL HERE.
AIN'T THAT BABY ASLEEP YET?
NOW, YOU GO ON AND GET OUT OF HERE
YOU'RE KEEPING HER ALL RILED UP.
AND KEEP HER
OUT OF MY WAY TOO
IF YOU WANT ME TO GET
THIS CHILD TO SLEEP.
EVERYTHING READY
DOWNSTAIRS, JEFF?
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS,
ELSE WHY I'VE BEEN OVER THAT STOVE
SINCE DAYLIGHT?
NOW, GO ON, GIT!
GOOD NIGHT, SARAH BETH.
YOU TOO. NOW GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE. VAMOOSE!
SURE IS LIGHT-FOOTED, AIN'T HE?
LIGHT-FINGERED, TOO,
IT BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE.
GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU
THE LADY FROM ST. LOUIS.
A GOOD TOAST TO REMEMBER
IN THIS HOUSE.
DRINK HEARTY, GENTLEMEN.
I KNOW YOU OF OLD
YOU ROBBED MY POOR FATHER
OF SILVER AND GOLD.
OH, WHISKEY, RYE WHISKEY...
WHAT ARE YOU SINGING?
IT'S A LULLABY, AND IT WON'T DO
MUCH LULLING
IF YOU PEOPLE KEEP COMING IN HERE
AND STOMPING AROUND.
HOW DO I LOOK, JEFF?
REAL PRETTY.
GO TO SLEEP, BABY...
JEFF, DO YOU EVER GET TIRED
OF COOKING FOR ALL
THESE PARTIES?
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT IF
I WAS YOU, COLONEL.
WOMEN GOT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF
PARTIES IN THEIR SYSTEM,
AND THEY JUST GOT
TO GET 'EM OUT.
GO TO SLEEP BABY...
GO TO SLEEP NOW.
JEFF, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL MOTHER.
YOU KNOW, BEING STIRRED UP
MUST BE GOOD FOR YOU, LUTIE.
BEEN MARRIED A WHOLE YEAR
AND STILL DON'T LOOK LIKE A WIFE.
STOP IT, BRICE.
WHAT KEEPS YOU
SO STIRRED UP, LUTIE?
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING
YOU WANT, HAVEN'T YOU?
STOP IT.
STOP IT, BRICE.
YOU CAN STOP ME EASY.
JUST TELL ME YOU'VE GOT
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.
TELL ME YOU'VE GOT EVEN PART
OF WHAT YOU WANT.
OH, COME ON, LUTIE,
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER ME?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY- BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LIE VERY WELL.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
THAT YOU'RE NOT AFRAID TO SAY.
JUST WHITE SAND,
JUST AS SOFT AS-
HELLO, NICK.
DANCE WITH ME, JIM.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, LUTIE?
NOTHING. THIS IS YOUR DANCE,
THAT'S ALL.
PLEASE.
MADE YOU SOME TEA.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
MAYBE IT WILL WARM ME
UP A LITTLE.
A REAL HEAVY SNOWFALL.
SNOWFALL? IT'S A BLIZZARD.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THE COLONEL, JEFF.
HE HASN'T BEEN HOME FOR 48 HOURS.
OH, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S ALWAYS ALL RIGHT.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE CATTLE.
HEY, KEEP THEM AWAY FROM
THAT BARBED WIRE!
HEAD 'EM OFF!
FENCE! KEEP 'EM OUT
OF THE HALLS'
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, SAM?
I TOLD BREWTON'S MEN THE NEXT STEER
THAT BUSTED DOWN MY FENCE
WAS GONNA GET BLOWN
TO PIECES.
BUT, SAM, THEM CATTLE
DON'T KNOW WHERE
THEY'RE DRIFTING IN THIS STORM.
MAYBE THEY'LL HEAD
THE OTHER WAY.
DON'T GO OUT THERE, SAM.
IT'S ONLY LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.
TROUBLE? IT WAS
TROUBLE LAST SUMMER
WHEN THEM CATTLE
TROMPLED OUR RYE CROP
BEFORE WE COULD HARVEST IT,
WASN'T IT?
I GOT FALL WHEAT PLANTED
OUT THERE
AND I AIN'T GONNA STAND BY
AND SEE IT GET RUINED!
SELINA, WITH THE NEW BABY COMING
IF WE DON'T MAKE THIS CROP
WE GOT TO GIVE UP.
NO, SAM! DON'T!
SAM, STAY HERE!
SAM! COME BACK! SAM!
KEEP THEM CATTLE
OUT OF MY WHEAT!
GET 'EM OUT OF THERE!
SAM, LOOK OUT!
COME ON, LET'S GET HIM!
KILL THAT YELLOWBELLY!
SAM!
SAM. SAM...
SAM.
SAM. SAM!
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
SELINA.
JEFF, JEFF!
IS JIM BACK?
NO, MRS. BREWTON,
THE COLONEL AIN'T HOME YET.
WELL, THEN WHAT'S HAPPENED, JEFF?
SOME OF THE BOYS
JUST GOT IN.
I HEATED UP SOME COFFEE.
NOW, YOU GET BACK TO BED. IT'S COLD.
NO, I'M NOT GOING BACK TO BED
UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENED.
IT WAS NOTHING MUCH.
A LITTLE BLOWUP OVER AT HALLS.
HALL SHOT ONE OF OUR STEERS,
AND THE BOYS KIND OF WORKED HIM
OVER. NOW GIT.
WORKED HIM OVER BAD?
WELL, THE BOYS SAID "GOOD."
I'M GOING OVER TO THE HALLS.
YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.
THERE'S DRIFTS.
YOU GET ME A HORSE.
SELINA'S EXPECTING ANOTHER BABY
I'M GOING TO SEE
IF SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
WELL, WRAP UP WARM.
SAM! I'VE COME
TO SEE SELINA.
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
LET ME IN, SAM.
NO.
WHAT'S HAPPENED?
SHE TRIED TO HELP ME.
THE BABY'S DEAD.
NO, SAM...
MAKE HER GO AWAY, SAM.
I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN.
SEND HER AWAY!
SELINA-
YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID.
NOW, GO ON BACK TO BREWTON.
TELL HIM HE'S WON.
TELL HIM HES WON A BIG VICTORY.
WE LEAVE NOW.
NOW GO ON. GET OUT.
WHOA.
GOOD. LOOK AFTER HIM
SURE, COLONEL.
LUTIE, I HEARD
ABOUT THE HALLS.
YES.
IT WAS A BAD NIGHT
ALL AROUND.
I LOST A COUPLE
OF HUNDRED HEAD.
SORRY, JIM.
WELL, IT'S NICE TO HOME
AGAIN WITH YOU.
JIM, SELINA'S BABY
IS DEAD.
I KNOW. TOO BAD.
JIM...
JIM, SHE'S SO BITTER
AND SO LOST.
WE'VE GOT TO LET HER
KNOW HOW SORRY WE ARE.
WE'VE GOT TO HELP THEM.
THE BEST WAY TO HELP THEM
IS TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM.
JIM, THEY SAY THEY'RE LEAVING.
LET THEM GO.
I MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE, LUTIE.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO YOU.
I WON'T AGAIN.
THE TIME I DID THOSE PEOPLE HARM
WAS WHEN LET THEM FILE.
MY FAULT, LUTIE
NOT YOURS.
JIM, IF YOU WON'T
HELP THE HALLS
FOR THEMSELVES,
THEN DO IT FOR ME.
I LOVE SELINA, AND RIGHT
NOW, SHE HATES ME.
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO, LUTIE.
THIS WOULD ONLY HAPPEN AGAIN,
OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.
IT FIGURED TO HAPPEN.
THIS TOUGH COUNTRY, LUTIE.
THIS COUNTRY, I'M SICK TO DEATH
OF TALKING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY.
YOU REALLY
THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE PEOPLE IN IT.
WELL, THAT DEPENDS,
IT DEPENDS ON
WHO THE PEOPLE ARE
AND WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.
YOU LET SELINA AND SAM HALL STAY HERE
BECAUSE YOU WANTED SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN-
TO SHOW ME,
TO SHOW EVERYONE
YOU DON'T CARE
HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE.
JUST SO LONG AS YOU KEEP THE GRASS
FOR YOURSELF.
LUTIE...
LUTIE... I'LL TRY TO TELL YOU, LUTIE.
IT'S HARD TO SAY
BUT...
THE HALLS DON'T COUNT
FOR MUCH, LUTIE.
NEITHER DO WE.
BUT THAT OUT THERE
DOES...
AND MEN LIKE CHAMBERLAIN,
THEY WANT TO FARM IT.
THEY WANT TO DIG IT UP
AND DRAW THE WATER OUT OF ITS VEINS,
LET THE SUN GET AT IT,
WAY DOWN DEEP.
IT WOULD CURL UP
AND DIE THEN, LUTIE,
IT WOULD BE DEAD,
AND SO WOULD THE WHOLE COUNTRY,
IT WOULD NEVER LIVE AGAIN.
I TRIED TO TELL YOU, LUTIE,
BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT, DID YOU?
WE WON'T ABOUT IT ANYMORE.
THAT'S RIGHT NO TALK, JUST YOU
AND THE GRASS THE OUT THERE.
THAT'S REALLY THE WAY
YOU WANT IT, ISN'T IT?
NO, LUTIE. I WANT
YOU WITH IT, TOO.
YOU DON'T NEED ME,
YOU NEVER DID.
LUTIE...
YOU'VE NEVER LIVED WITH ME.
I'VE BEEN HERE.
YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE.
JIM, I'D LIKE TO GO AWAY.
I'VE GOT TO.
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA.
YOU COULD DO A LITTLE
SHOPPING IN DENVER.
SOME THINKING TOO.
DENVER PAPER!
ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS!
NEWS?
DENVER PAPER?
CALL FOR MR. O'CONNOR!
CALL FOR
MR. O'CONNOR!
WELL, SIR, I FIGURE IF WE'RE EVER GOING
TO BREAK THE HOLD
OF THE CATTLEMEN,
WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE SALT FORK
A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.
AND SEE TO IT THAT AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE
IS APPOINTED. - RIGHT.
HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR STAY
AT THE BROWN PALACE, MRS. BREWTON.
THE MARSHALL ALWAYS WINDS UP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN, ONE MOMENT.
LUTIE! IN DENVEROF ALL PLACES!
BUT NOT FOR LONG.
LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE
PITY ON ME AT DINNER TONIGHT.
I'M AFRAID NOT BRICE,
MY TRAIN GOES IN THE MORNING, VERY EARLY.
THERE'S NO TRAIN LEAVING
FOR SALT FORK IN THE MORNING.
THIS TRAIN GOES TO ST. LOUIS.
OH, I'M SORRY, LUTIE.
I UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE
YOU DON'T WANT TO
SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
LUTIE...
I HAVE A SLEIGH
WITH A DRIVER.
CONSIDER IT YOURS
IF YOU'D LIKE SOME AIR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BRICE.
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU.
WITHOUT ME, OF COURSE.
CALL FOR ME AT 8:00.
BREWTON'S A BIG MAN,
I'VE NEVER DENIED IT.
BUT, WELL, IT JUST DOESN'T LEAVE
ROOM FOR ANYONE ELSE-
FOR YOU, IN THIS CASE.
I USED TO WONDER HOW LONG
IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO
ADMIT THAT TO YOURSELF.
YOU NEVER REALLY EXPECTED
HIM TO CHANGE, DID YOU?
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
IT WAS REALLY YOUR FAULT.
YOU KNEW IT WAS HOPELESS.
YOU KNEW IT THE FIRST
TIME I SAW YOU.
YOU KNEW IT
IN THE COURTROOM.
IT'S BEEN WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE
EVERY TIME SINCE THEN.
THE HALLS WERE YOUR FAULT, TOO.
YOU INSISTED ON PLUNKING THEM DOWN
RIGHT IN THE LION'S DEN.
AND SAT AROUND HOPING
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN.
WELL, IT HAPPENED.
IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN
BREWTON BEING BREWTON.
OH, LUTIE, I'M SORRY,
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
I JUST WANT TO CRY,
THAT'S ALL.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S FINE,
ONLY, ONLY...
I FEEL THAT IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT ANYONE
HAS SPOKEN TO ME
IN MONTHS IN MONTHS
IN MONTHS
I MEAN, ABOUT ME.
ANYWAY, WHAT YOU SAY
IS TRUE.
AND I DON'T MIND
LOOKING AT IT AT LAST.
IT DOESN'T LEAVE ME MUCH,
BUT I DON'T MIND
LOOKING AT IT.
IT LEAVES YOU ME,
LUTIE.
COME IN.
COME IN, BRICE.
THE ST. LOUIS TRAIN
LEAVES IN HALF AN HOUR.
I KNOW.
I HAVE A LITTLE MORE
PACKING TO DO.
WHEN PEOPLE PACK,
THEY'RE GOING SOMEWHERE.
WHEN THEY'RE GOING SOMEWHERE,
IT'S BETTER TO KNOW WHERE.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BRICE?
I MEAN, WHAT'S IT
GOING TO BE, LUTIE?
I'LL GIVE YOU TIME.
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.
I'LL STAND BACK UNTIL YOU SEND
FOR ME
OR I'LL TAKE THAT TRAIN
TO ST. LOUIS WITH YOU.
IT WILL BE WHAT YOU WANT,
LUTIE, WHATEVER IT IS.
IT WILL BE YOUR WAY,
ALL THE WAY.
BRICE...
I'M SO ASHAMED...
AND SO SORRY.
ASHAMED FOR ME,
SORRY FOR YOU.
AND JIM.
BREWTON'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S GOT YOU NOW
AS HE NEVER HAD YOU BEFORE.
NO, BRICE.
YOU'RE HANGING ON TO YOURSELF
RIGHT NOW
TO KEEP FROM RUNNING BACK TO HIM.
NO, BRICE.
AND YOU'RE GOING.
- NO.
YES, YOU ARE. NOTHING ON EARTH
CAN STOP YOU.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I KNOW HE WON'T CHANGE.
I KNOW I'LL GO HATING
WHAT HE DOES.
AND IT WILL
ALWAYS HURT ME.
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES
OR WHAT I THINK...
NO MATTER WHERE I GO...
I'LL KEEP FEELING THAT MOST OF ME
IS THERE WITH HIM.
IT MEANS THAT YOU LOVE HIM.
YES.
AND IF I DO,
THEN I'VE GOT
TO BELIEVE IN HIM...
AND GO ALONG WITH HIM.
I'LL GO BACK. TELL HIM
WHAT I'VE DONE...
IF I HAVE THE COURAGE.
I'M SORRY FOR YOU, LUTIE.
I GOT A BIG FIRE IN THE LIVING ROOM,
MRS. BREWTON.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
HAS SARAH BETH BEEN ALL RIGHT?
SHE'S FINER THAN THAN FUZZ.
I GOT A REAL NICE FIRE
DOWNSTAIRS.
ALL RIGHT, JEFF.
COLONEL TRADED JOE NETHERWOOD
OUT OF IT.
IT'S THE ONLY PIANO IN
THE TERRITORY.
GAVE HIM HIS BEST WHITEFACE BULL.
GOOD FIRE, AIN'T IT?
YES, JEFF.
THANK YOU, JIM.
JUST A FOOL IDEA I HAD.
KIND OF LIKE
HAVING YOU AROUND.
PLAY ME A TUNE, LUTIE.
SAD MUSIC
OR HAPPY MUSIC?
UP TO YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF TUNE
YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR HEAD.
LIKE IT?
PRETTY. KIND OF
A SURPRISE, THOUGH.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SAD.
IT WAS SAD WHEN
YOU WENT AWAY.
COME HERE, JIM.
STAND BEHIND ME.
JIM, WHEN I WENT AWAY,
I DIDN'T INTEND TO COME BACK
EXCEPT TO GET SARAH BETH.
I WAS GOING TO ST. LOUIS.
I FELT IT WAS STILL MY TOWN,
THAT I WOULD BE RIGHT THERE.
YEAH. TREES
IN ST. LOUIS.
YES, TREES YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLANT
AND CHERISH AND PROTECT.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU EVER NOTICED.
WHY DID YOU PLANT
THEM, LUTIE?
WERE THEY TO SHUT SOMETHING OUT
OR TO SHUT YOURSELF IN?
JIM, I WAS JEALOUS-
PLAIN MEAN JEALOUS
OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE GRASS,
AND I TRIED TO FIGHT IT.
YES, WITH THE TREES AND
WITH SELINA AND SAM
AND WITH A LOT
THINGS.
I WON'T FIGHT IT
ANYMORE, JIM.
I'LL KNOW THAT IT'S THERE,
AND I WON'T CRY ABOUT IT.
AND I WON'T
SAY BITTER THINGS,
AND I WON'T RUN AWAY.
I... I'M BACK, JIM,
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.
I'LL HAVE YOU, LUTIE.
JIM, DON'T YOU WANT TO ASK ME
HOW DENVER WAS?
AH. DENVER'S ALWAYS
DENVER.
BUT, JIM...
I'LL MAKE IT
UP TO YOU, JIM.
WHAT IS THERE TO MAKE UP?
YOU'RE HERE.
THERE'S REALLY NO REASON
TO WORRY, LUTIE.
JUST DO THE WAY YOU DID
WITH SARAH BETH.
I'LL GO TELL
JIM YOU'RE FINE.
YES, DOC, I'M FINE.
WHEN DO YOU KNOW
WHEN IT'S TUNED?
I JUST KNOW.
DOC, WHAT'S HOLDING UP
SCIENCE?
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE
ABLE TO TELL A MAN
WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL?
WHAT DO YOU WANT, JIM?
WELL, WE GOT A GIRL.
COME ON! CHEER UP, DOC.
JIM, YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE
LUTIE'S OUT OF HER HEAD,
BOUND TO SAY THINGS
WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND.
JUST-JUST DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT.
GO ON DOWNSTAIRS AND LET
JEFF GET YOU A CUP OF COFFEE.
OH, JEFF POUR HIM A CUP
OF COFFEE.
I GOT A POT
ON THE STOVE.
AND ME, TOO.
YOU'D BETTER
COME IN, DOCTOR.
SHE'S QUIT THAT WILD
TALK AND
I THINK THE BABY
IS GETTING CLOSE.
I NEVER HEARD
SUCH CARRYINGS-ON.
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE SAID-
MRS. RYAN, NONE OF US HEARD ANYTHING
IN THAT ROOM WORTH REPEATING.
OF COURSE NOT.
CERTAINLY NOT.
I HOPE YOU REMEMEBER
THAT, MRS. RYAN.
WELL, LUTIE,
WE'VE GOT A SON.
MACK, WANT TO HAVE A SMOKE?
THANKS, JIM. ONLY GET THESE
WHEN I COME HERE.
DOC?
NO THANKS, JIM.
MRS. McCURTIN WAS SAYING
ONLY YESTERDAY, LUTIE,
BEFORE BROCK WAS BORN
WE USED TO SEE A LOT OF YOU IN TOWN.
THE PAST YEAR OR SO,
YOU'VE BEEN HOLING UP ON US.
SHE SPENDS TOO MUCH TIME
WITH THEM CHILDREN,
SHE'S BOUND TO SPOIL THEM.
SURE BOTH BABIES GOT OVER
THE CROUP RIGHT?
THEY GOT OVER IT ALL RIGHT,
NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THAT
MEDICINE YOU GAVE THEM.
YOU GOING TO TAKE THIS OR
AREN'T YOU?
THAT SO, JEFF?
WHAT CURED THEM?
BAKING SODA,
AND LOTS OF IT.
CURE ANY KIND OF A COLD.
DOCTORS!
WE GAVE THEM YOUR MEDICINE
BEHIND JEFF'S BACK.
DON'T EVER LET HIM
KNOW ABOUT IT, THOUGH.
WELL, COME ON, MACK,
LET'S HAVE IT.
WHAT?
THE BAD NEWS.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?
ALL OVER YOU
EVER SINCE YOU GOT HERE.
I'VE GOT A HUNCH CHAMBERLAIN'S
UP TO SOMETHING.
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?
ALL OVER HIM THE LAST TIME
I SAW HIM.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, JIM.
HE'S UP TO PLENTY.
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR BUSINESS
AND YOUR BRANDY.
NO, NO, SIT DOWN. MACK'S A LAWYER.
HE LIKES AN AUDIENCE.
CHAMBERLAIN'S GOT SALT FORK
MADE A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.
GOT HIMSELF ELECTED JUDGE.
WHAT ABOUT JUDGE WHITE?
ONLY LOCAL MATTERS NOW.
OH, IS THAT SO?
AND HERES CHAMBERLAIN'S
MESSAGE TO YOU, JIM.
TOMORROW HE'S SENDING NOTICE TO
EVERY SQUATTER IN TOWN
AND THERE'S A WHOLE
THE WAGON TRAIN OF 'EM-
THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
REPRESENTED HERE NOW
AND WILL THEM
FULL PROTECTION.
YOU'LL HAVE A HUNDRED CLAIMS ON
YOUR RANGE BEFORE THE WEEK IS OUT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE OUGHT TO DO, MACK?
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR A CHANCE-
ANY CHANCE OF ANY
KIND- TO HEAD IT OFF
BUT THERE ISN'T ANY.
IT'S THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT NOW,
THE LAW OF THE LAND,
AND IT'S OBEYED.
IT'S GOT TO BE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, LUTIE?
I? WELL, I THINK
MACK HAS SAID IT, JIM.
IT HAD TO HAPPEN, JIM.
EVERYONE KNEW IT.
I THINK YOU DID
IN YOUR HEART.
NO.
NO, I DIDN'T, LUTIE.
WELL!
GOOD.
GOOD NIGHT DEAR.
HOW IS YOUR FINGER
WHERE YOU CUT IT?
YOU TOLD ME
IT WOULDN'T HURT.
WELL, IT WON'T HURT, EITHER.
ANYTHING YOU SAY
GOES, HUH, JIM?
SURE. SHE'S JIM'S GIRL.
HER FIRST CRUSH.
COME, SARAH BETH.
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, LUTIE.
VERY NICE DINNER.
THANK YOU.
GOOD NIGHT, LUTIE.
GOOD NIGHT, JIM.
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.
DON'T GET LUTIE
WRONG, JIM.
SHE'S A WOMAN,
AND, WELL..
I DON'T GET HER
WRONG, DOC.
IT'S JUST THAT I KEEP
WISHING SHE WAS REALLY ON MY SIDE.
WELL, HELP YOURSELVES,
GENTLEMEN.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, JIM?
RIGHT NOW? GOING FOR
A LITTLE WALK.
IS THAT COLD?
BANTY,
BRING JOE.
HOLD HER A MINUTE.
CAN I GO UNDER THERE?
ANDY, YOU TAKE THE DAVIS PLACE
AND MCGEE'S RANCH.
TELL THEM I WANTS TO SEE THEM.
TELL THEM IT WON'T HURT
TO BRING THEIR WINCHESTERS.
WAKE, YOU TAKE VALEZ'S RANCH AND
THE OUTFIT SOUTH.
YOU BET, COLONEL.
GET GOING.
YOU WERE GOING
TO PUT ME TO BED.
YES, DARLING. I'LL COME RIGHT
BACK AND PUT YOU TO BED.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I COULD CRY FOR YOU, JIM
DON'T WASTE IT
ON ME, LUTIE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO UP AND TRY TO
GET SOME SLEEP?
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I NEED.
WHY DO YOU KEEP
LOOKING AT ME?
WHAT DO YOU KEEP
WANTING OF ME?
NOTHING, LUTIE. NOTHING ANYMORE.
I DON'T EXPECT IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, JIM?
IF CHAMBERLAIN WANTS TO DECLARE WAR,
HE'S GOING TO GET IT.
YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO GO OUT
AND SHOOT
THE FIRST HOMESTEADERS THAT
COME OVER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
IN COLD BLOOD?
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO CALL IT.
DON'T DO IT, JIM.
GIVE UP ON IT.
WHO ARE YOU
PROTECTING?
YOU, JIM. YOU.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO LOSE?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
BUT YOU DO, DON'T YOU?
WELL, I-I GUESS SO.
MAYBE I DO.
WHY? WHY?
I... I... MAYBE THEN
I'D HAVE A CHANCE.
MAYBE YOU'D TURN
TO ME-TO ME ALONE.
IS THAT THE ONLY REASON?
JIM, IT'S MURDER,
KILLING PEOPLE.
I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD BEAR IT.
I... I'VE TRIED TO FIT IN, I'VE TRIED TO
BE WHAT YOU WANT, BUT...
YOU HAVE DONE THAT.
I'VE SEEN YOU TRYING.
BUT TO GO OUT
IN COLD BLOOD...
BUT I'VE SEEN OTHER THINGS I'VE SAID
NOTHING ABOUT.
THEY'RE INNOCENT PEOPLE, JIM.
I'M GOING TO DO
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
ALL RIGHT, JIM.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT?
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
I'VE NOTHING MORE TO SAY.
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO?
NOTHING. I'LL WAIT.
NOTHING MORE TO SAY?
NO.
YOU'D GO ON LIVING WITH A MURDERER,
LUTIE? WHY?
WHY DO YOU OWE ME THAT?
THAT'S A LOT.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ONCE.
YOU'VE CHANGED/
WHAT CHANGED YOU?
WHY DO YOU OWE ME SO MUCH?
THE TRIP TO DENVER, MAYBE?
YOU NEVER REALLY TOLD ME
WHY YOU CAME BACK HERE.
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
NOW, LUTIE?
NOTHING MORE TO DAY.
WELL, I GUESS THAT
SAYS IT ALL.
IT TOOK A LONG TIME
BUT IT'S ALL SET NOW.
I TRIED, JIM. I TRIED.
MORE THAN ONCE.
BUT YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME.
YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME
AND STOPPED ME.
I COULDN'T. I COULDN'T.
BUT NOW I'M GLAD
IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN.
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS.
I'M GLAD IT'S OUT
AFTER 2 YEARS. I'M GLAD IT'S OUT.
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE, LUTIE?
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.
THEN WHEN ARE YOU
GOINGTO LEAVE?
YOU CAN CATCH THE NEXT TRAIN.
YOU'D BETTER GO UP AND PACK.
WE'LL START IN THE MORNING.
I DON'T SEE HOW,
WITH ALL THE CHILDREN'S THINGS.
THE CHILDREN'S THINGS?
YOU WON'T HAVE TO PACK THOSE.
YOU THINK I'D LEAVE THEM HERE?
I'M SURE OF IT.
I COULDN'T LEAVE THEM.
YOU CAN TAKE
ONE OF THEM, LUTIE.
ONE?
YOU CAN TAKE BROCK.
BUT IF YOU TAKE HIM
YOU TAKE EVERYTHING THAT GOES WITH IT,
AND SO DOES HE.
IF YOU LEAVE HIM
I'LL BRING HIM UP, AND I'LL DO FOR HIM.
A MAN WANTS A SON.
ALL RIGHT, JIM.
I THOUGHT YOU'D
SEE IT MY WAY.
BUT I... I WON'T LET YOU KEEP
THEM FOREVER. I'LL FIGHT.
THAT'S ONE FIGHT
I WOULDN'T LOSE, LUTIE.
YOU STILL CARRY HIM
IN YOUR HEART. DON'T YOU?
I CARRY YOU
IN MY HEART, JIM
I LOVE YOU. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?
I LOVE YOU.
YOU COULDN'T LOVE ME
AND BE AGAINST ME.
YOU'LL BOTH HAVE TO BE
VERY GOOD FOR JEFF.
AND SARAH BETH, DARLING.
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF BRCK, WON'T YOU?
OH, DARLING, YOU'RE SO LITTLE.
YOU WON'T REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T.
I'LL REMEMBER.
THE COLONEL'S READY NOW, MRS. BREWTON.
CAN I GO FOR A RIDE TOO,
TOO, MAMA?
NOT TODAY, DARLING.
REMEMBER, I'LL BE BACK
SOONER THAN SOON,
WITH A DOUBLE
PRESENT FOR BOTH.
GOOD-BYE, JEFF.
YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND.
DON'T YOU WORRY,
MRS. BREWTON.
SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT ME
TO MY CHILDREN, JEFF.
GOODBYE.
GOODBYE, DOC.
YOU BE GOOD.
READY?
DOC GAVE ME THIS
CHECK FROM YOU.
ALL ABOARD!
IS THIS THE WAY
WE SAY GOODBYE?
YOU SAID GOOD-BYE, LUTIE.
TWO YEARS AGO.
HE'S JUST TURNING
IN THE DOOR.
COME IN, JIM. GLAD YOU COULD
MAKE IT.
WHAT DID YOU GET ME
HERE FOR, DOC?
WELL, JIM, I GOT A FUNNY FEELING
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING
TO BE KILLED.
BUT YOU TWO
CAN STOP IT.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, DOC.
THE LAW'S GOING TO BE
ENFORCED. THAT'S ALL.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER DOC.
DON'T BE A FOOL, BREWTON.
GO AFTER HER.
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
I TRIED.
I TRIED IN DENVER
AND AGAIN YESTERDAY BEFORE SHE LEFT.
YOU WERE IN THE WAY.
YOU STILL ARE.
HI, COLONEL!
WE'RE ALL SET.
EVERYBODY'S ALL HERE, COLONEL-EVERY
COWMAN WHO COULD SET A HORSE.
THERE'S MORE AMMUNITION.
TELL THEM TO HELP THEMSELVES.
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.
RIGHT. HERE'S MORE AMMUNITION,
BOYS. COME AND GET IT!
COME AND GET IT, BOYS!
THERE'S MORE AMMUNITION HERE.
MORE AMMUNITION HERE...
PHELPS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE, PRACTICE MARCH?
NO, I WISH IT WERE.
I'M HERE TO SEE THAT THE
HOMESTEADERS ARE LET ALONE.
OH?
NOW, DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT, JIM.
I'M A COWMAN MYSELF.
I SETTLED OUT HERE
THE SAME TIME YOU DID.
I DON'T LIKE THIS.
BUT MY ORDERS COME FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND THEY SAY TO KEEP
THE PEACE OUT HERE.
SO I GUESS I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO TRY.
THAT SO?
THE MEN I'VE GOT ARE GOOD MEN.
THEY'LL DO AS THEIR ORDERS READ.
A LOT OF THEM MAY DIE.
YOU'VE GOT GOOD MEN, TOO.
LOOKS AS THOUGH
YOU OUTNUMBER US.
SO YOU'D PROBABLY
WIN TODAY.
BUT NOTHING WOULD STAY WON.
THEY'D SEND A REGIMENT OUT HERE
IF IT WAS NECESSARY AND
ALL YOUR MEN WOULD BE DEAD.
NOT ONLY YOU-YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT
TO DECIDE THAT YOURSELF-BUT THEM TOO.
AS I SAID BEFORE, JIM.
THEY'RE GOOD MEN.
THEY'RE REAL GOOD MEN.
WELL, BOYS, I'M AFRAID
WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT,
UNLESS SOMEBODY FEELS
DIFFERENT ABOUT IT.
SO, I GUESS WE'LL JUST GO ON HOME.
MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS
WE'LL BE SORRY WE DID.
THEY CAN KEEP THE NESTOR FROM
BEING BLOWN AWAY
BUT ONLY
GOD CAN HELP THE PRAIRIE.
NOW, UM, UH, LET ME UNDERSTAND
THIS CLEARLY, MR. CRANE.
UH, YOU BELIEVE THAT I MAY BE
ABLE TO GAIN CUSTODY OF MY SON
BUT TO DO THIS, I MUST
ESTABLISH IN THE COURT
UNDER OATH THE IDENTITY OF HIS FATHER?
IN ORDER TO HAVE HIM
LEGALLY, IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
AND-AND IT IS ALSO YOUR OPINION
THAT IF I DO PROVE MY RIGHT TO HIM
I MAY FORFEIT MY RIGHT
TO MY DAUGHTER?
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
THE SIZE OF IT, LUTIE.
YOU WOULD, IN THE EYES
OF THE COURT, FOREVER PROVE
YOUR UNFITNESS TO HAVE HER.
BUT WITH LUCK,
YOU COULD HAVE BROCK.
YES, WITH LUCK, I'D
SUCCEED IN BRANDING ONE,
SEPARATING THEM
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
I'M SORRY, LUTIE.
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?
ARE YOU GOING TO STAY
IN ST. LOUIS, MY DEAR?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
MR. CRANE.
SINCE MY FATHER DIED
I DON'T SEEM TO BELONG
HERE ANYMORE, EITHER.
GOOD-BYE. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
WRITE TO ME, DOC.
LET ME KNOW ABOUT MY BABIES.
HOW THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO.
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME PLEASE.
LOVE, LUTIE.
YOU ARE MISSED, LUTIE.
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY BLEW OUT
A LIGHT, AND IT'S A LITTLE
DARKER FOR ALL OF US.
JIM HAD THE CHILDREN IN
THE OTHER DAY FOR ME TO LOOK OVER.
AND THEY'RE HEALTHY
AS GOATS.
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
SALT FORK, LUTIE.
THE TOWN'S JAM-PACKED EVERY DAY.
STOREKEEPERS ARE TRUCKING
TO THE HOMESTEADERS, NOW.
HARDLY EVER SEE A CATTLEMAN
ANYMORE, UNLESS IT'S
WHEN THEY COME IN TO FIGHT
AND LOSE ONE OF THE
LAWSUITS THAT'S ALWAYS BEING
SLAPPED ON THEM BY FARMERS.
THE COURT THEREFORE
FIXES DAMAGES.
FOR THE FULL MARKET VALUE
OF THE MATURED CROP.
CHAMBERLAIN WAS HEARD
TO SAY THAT GOD WAS
ON THE SIDE OF THE HOMESTEADERS.
I DON'T KNOW AS I COULD SPEAK
FOR HIM BUT I'VE GOT TO
ADMIT THAT THE CROPS ARE GOOD.
THE HEADS ON THE WHEAT ARE
SO HEAVY, THEY'LL
KNOCK A MAN'S HEAD OFF.
AND THE CORN CAN SWALLOW UP
A HORSE AND RIDER.
THIS IS RICH LAND, ALL RIGHT.
AND THE SODBUSTERS ARE
REAPING ITS FIRST FLOWER.
MAYBE THAT WHAT GOD
ORDERED, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU ASK ABOUT JIM.
WELL, HE NEVER SAYS MUCH
BUT HIS BACK'S A LITTLE STRAIGHTER
AND HIS HEAD'S A
LITTLE HIGHER THAN EVER.
SARAH BETH FOLLOWS HER FATHER AROUND
LIKE SHE WAS A LONESOME PUP.
I GOT TO ADMIT THAT JIM TREATS
HER ABOUT LIKE SHE WAS A PUP.
NOT THAT HE ISN'T GOOD TO HER.
I GUESS IT'S THIS WAY.
SARAH BETH GIVES ALL TO JIM.
AND HE GIVES IT ALL
TO BROCK.
AND BROCK... WELL, BROCK'S LIKE
HE ALWAYS WAS-
TEMPER LIKE A BUZZ SAW
AND A SMILE LIKE A FEATHERED ANGEL.
OH DOC, I AM LONELY,
BUT I KNOW I SHOULD STAY AWAY, AND
I WILL JUST AS LONG AS I CAN.
JUST AS LONG AS I CAN.
DOC!
LUTIE! OH!
OH!
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.
RIG IS RIGHT OVER HERE.
IT'S ALL CHANGED.
YES...
TELL ME, LUTIE, WHY DID YOU REALLY COME?
JUST TO SEE THE CHILDREN?
THAT MOSTLY. IT'S BEEN
PRETTY BAD, DOC.
WHERE'S JIM?
WAITING AT THE HOTEL.
WAITING?
TO TAKE THE CHILDREN HOME
AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THEM.
OH. DID HE MIND
ABOUT MY SEEING THEM?
HE DIDN'T SAY ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.
DOC... WHAT ABOUT JIM?
WHERE I'M CONCERNED, I MEAN? TELL ME.
HONEY, IT'S PRETTY HARD TO SAY.
HE'S JUST NEVER MENTIONED
YOUR NAME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT, MRS. SMITH.
DOC... THEY DON'T KNOW ME.
THEY'RE VERY YOUNG.
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS,
LUTIE. YOU CAN'T EXPECT IT.
NO, I DON'T EXPECT IT.
I ONLY HOPED.
DO YOU REMEMBER? I SAID I'D BRING
A DOUBLE PRESENT FOR BOTH OF YOU?
DO YOU REMEMBER, SARAH BETH?
NO.
BUT YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE A PRESENT,
WOULDN'T YOU?
YES.
THEN YOU WAIT. AND LOOK AT
WHAT I HAVE IN MY BAG.
NOW, YOU LOOK IN THE BAG.
SAW HER OFF GETTING OFF THE TRAIN
AS BIG AS LIFE.
WENT RIGHT OVER TO DOC REID'S.
YOU MUST LEAVE
AT ONCE, BRICE.
DO YOU REALIZE I'VE NEVER EVEN
TOUCHED HIM BEFORE.
NEVER BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH TO LOOK
INTO HIS EYES. HE'S A FINE BOY.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE.
BROCK.
JIM.
COME ON, KIDS.
TIME TO GO NOW.
I'M SORRY, LUTIE.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME BACK.
I'VE BROUGHT EVERYTHING
TO LIFE AGAIN.
AND THE CHILDREN, BRICE,
THEY DON'T KNOW ME.
I'M NOT SURE THEY EVEN
LIKE ME.
THEY WERE JUST WAITING
FOR THE TIME TO GO HOME.
THEY DON'T NEED ME. THEY DON'T
NEED ANYTHING FROM ME.
LISTEN TO ME, LUTIE.
YOU AND I, WE COULD
GET BROCK. HE'S OURS.
LET BREWTON HAVE
SARAH BETH.
WE COULD TAKE BROCK AWAY
HE BELONGS WITH YOU AND ME.
WE CAN GET AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE
AS TRAINS COULD CARRY US.
THIS IS OUR LAST
CHANCE, LUTIE.
THE LAST CHANCE
FOR THE 3 OF US.
I CAN'T GO AWAY WITH YOU, BRICE.
I CAN'T HAVE BROCK.
AND I CAN'T HAVE SARAH BETH.
SO I'M GOING TO GO,
BUT I'LL GO ALONE.
AND YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING FOR ME.
NOT ENOUGH, BRICE.
NOT ENOUGH FOR THAT.
COME ON IN.
DOC?
GLAD MACK GOT
YOU HERE, JIM.
HAVEN'T BEEN SEEING
VERY MUCH OF YOU LATELY.
I HAVEN'T BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.
SO I NOTICED.
I USED TO LOVE YOU
LIKE THE SON I NEVER HAD.
NOT ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW WHY?
MAYBE YOU BETTER
NOT TALK ABOUT IT NOW, DOC.
I GOT TO. I'LL TELL
YOU WHY-LUTIE.
I CAN SAY IT NOW-LUTIE.
YOU WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY
SPEAK HER NAME, WOULD YOU, JIM?
BUT YOU GOT TO HUMOR ME.
LAST WISH, YOU KNOW.
ALL LUTIE NEEDED WAS...
WAS A LITTLE HELP... FROM YOU.
SHE HAD BETTER COMING
THAN SHE GOT.
SHE NEVER FORGOT HER CHILDREN.
SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.
AND YOU SENT HER
AWAY TWICE. YOUR FAULT.
THAT'S RIGHT. YOURS.
PEOPLE DON'T TELL YOU THAT
MUCH, DO THEY, JIM?
JIM.
JIM!
DO YOU HEAR ME?
YES, DOC, I HEAR YOU.
YOU'LL-YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.
YOU'VE STILL GOT THAT SAME
LOOK IN YOUR EYES.
YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.
THE DOC... OUT OF HIS HEAD,
I GUESS, JIM.
NO. HE WAS RIGHT.
JUST RIGHT.
HE'S GONE GENTLEMEN.
COLONEL BREWTON,
I HAVE NO IDEA.
ARE YOU SURE?
VERY SURE.
I WONDER HOW SHE'S
FIXED FOR MONEY.
MR. CAMERON LEFT
VERY LITTLE.
I SEE.
I MIGHT ADD ONE THING.
IF I DID KNOW WHERE YOUR WIFE WAS
YOU ARE THE LAST ONE I WOULD TELL.
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE HER ALONE NOW?
BROCK! BROCK!
WAIT A MINUTE, SISTER
LET THEM-LET THEM FINISH!
JEFF! JEFF! BROCK'S FIGHTING AGAIN!
JEFF!
BROCK! STOP THAT FIGHTING!
HEY, ED, I'M BETTING ON THE
CHAMBERLAIN KID!
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID?
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.
I'M BETTING ON THE CHAMBERLAIN KID.
YOU WANT TO COVER MY BET?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
JEFF?
WHAT WAS SAID
HERE, BILL?
IF ANYBODY'S GOT
ANYTHING TO SAY
NOW'S THE TIME
TO SAY IT.
COME ON, BROCK.
DON'T WORRY, LUTIE.
I'LL KEEP ON
WRITING TO YOU.
I KNOW YOU'VE TURNED TO ME
ONLY BECAUSE DOC REID IS GONE.
AND THAT YOU WANT
NOTHING FROM ME
BUT NEWS OF YOUR CHILDREN.
IN THIS LETTER, I'M SENDING
YOU A LIKENESS OF SARA BETH AND BROCK.
I OBTAINED IT BY DEVIOUS METHODS
FROM THE LOCAL
PHOTOGRAPHER.
YOU ASK
ABOUT BREWTON, LUTIE.
I KNOW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT HIM.
HE SELDOM COMES TO TOWN,
EXCEPT TO DO SOME BUYING
FOR THE RANCH NOW AND THEN.
IT WOULD BREAK YOUR HEART
TO RIDE THROUGH THIS COUNTRY NOW, LUTIE.
IT'S ALL DRYING UP
AND BLOWING AWAY.
BREWTON WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.
THIS LAND WAS NOT READY FOR THE PLOW.
IT NEEDED HELP FROM US.
DURING THOSE FIRST YEARS
WHEN THE RAINS CAME,
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT WORK
PLANNING AGAINST THE TIME
WHEN NATURE WOULD FAIL US.
WE SHOULD HAVE BUILT DAMS
AND BROUGHT OUR OWN RAIN
AND IRRIGATION DITCHES
AND CULVERTS AND DIVERTED STREAMS.
SOMEDAY WE WILL DO THESE THINGS
AND THE LAND WILL COME BACK.
THE HOPE OF SEEING THAT
KEEPS ME HERE.
AND SOMETHING ELSE
HOLDS ME, TOO.
BROCK IS GROWING UP, LUTIE,
AND THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING WORRIES ME.
WHEN SARAH WAS HOME,
SHE USED TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.
BUT NOW THAT SHE'S AWAY
AT SCHOOL,
BREWTON MAKES NO MOVE
TO CURB BROCK IN ANYTHING.
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH HE WERE TRYING
TO MAKE UP TO HIM FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
YOU, LUTIE.
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S BAD FOR BROCK AND I DON'T LIKE IT.
BUT I'M FORCED TO STAND BY
HELPLESS TO DO ANYTHING,
AND WATCH THE WILDNESS
IN THE BOY GROW STRONGER.
EVERYONE LIKES HIM.
MAYBE THAT'S THE TROUBLE.
HE'S RIGHT AT HOME EVERYPLACE.
WHETHER HE'S JOSHING THE
GIRLS AT CLANCY'S DANCE HALL,
OR PLAYING THE BLUE DANUBE
ON MYRA NETHERWOODS' NEW GRAND PIANO.
HE'S A PRIME FAVORITE.
BUT HE'S A WALKING
CONTRADICTION, TOO.
ONE DAY HE'LL BE DEALING
WESTERN EUCHRE FROM THE BEST
HORSEHAIR FURNITURE IN TOWN,
AND THE NEXT HE'LL BE PRANCING
UP AND DOWN THE STREETS IN
HIS NEW RED-WHEEL BUGGY
WITH A HOMESTEADER GIRL
BESIDE HIM.
YOU MAY SEE HIM BUYING OUT
A SHOWCASE OF JAWBREAKERS
AT THE KINGMAN MERCANTILE CO.
FOR A BUNCH OF RUNNY-NOSED KIDS,
GENTLE AS A WOMAN,
OR KEEPING A TOMATO CAN ROLLING
AT 50 FEET WITH A SIX-SHOOTER.
IT GIVES ME PAUSE, LUTIE,
TO SEE HIM.
THERE'S SUCH A LOT OF RECKLESSNESS
UNDER THAT CRAZY CHARM.
THERE'S A DANGER IN HIM
AND A KIND OF VIOLENCE.
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO KEEP MY HANDS OFF.
SOMETIMES WHEN HE LOOKS AT ME AS WE PASS
THERE'S NEVER MORE THAN
A FLICK OF HIS EYE-
I FEEL THAT HE MUST KNOW SOMETHING,
AND THAT HE MUST HATE ME FOR IT.
I UNDERSTAND SARA BETH GRADUATED
LAST WEEK WITH HIGH HONORS.
SARAH BETH BREWTON.
HAZEL SAWYER.
THEY TELL ME
SHE'LL BE HOME SOON.
I WONDER HOW SALT FORK
WILL SEEM TO HER NOW
AFTER HER YEARS OF SCHOOLING?
PARDON ME, MA'AM.
I'M LOOKING FOR A LITTLE, SAWED-OFF,
FRECKLED, UGLY RUNT OF A GIRL.
I'M LOOKING FOR
A HANDSOME YOUNG GENTLEMAN.
WELL, YOU FOUND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR, BUT HOW ABOUT ME?
YOU WENT AND
CHANGED ON US.
OH, BROCK!
HELLO, SARAH BETH.
WHERE'S PAPA?
PAPA!
PAPA!
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
SARAH BETH.
OH, I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN
YOU'D BE LIKE THIS, BOTH OF YOU.
LIKE WHAT?
OH, GOOD-LOOKING.
A COUPLE OF YEARS DO A LOT FOR
A YOUNG LADY, DON'T THEY?
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT-
OF ME, I MEAN?
NOT AS MUCH
AS WE GOT, EH, BROCK?
NOT HALF. I DON'T KNOW THOUGH.
LOOKS STUCK UP TO ME
PROBABLY WON'T EVEN
LIKE OUR TOWN ANYMORE.
YOUR TOWN? MY TOWN.
OH HO. MAYBE YOU'LL DO,
HUH, COLONEL?
WELL, IT'S THE SAME OLD
PLACE. SAME...
YEAH. WELL, I'M GONNA LEAVE
YOU HERE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
RIGHT HERE. CHARLEY'S.
CARDS ARE PRETTY HOT FOR ME TODAY.
YOU BETTER NOT GET FRESH WITH
CHARLEY. HE CAN TEACH YOU.
YEAH? CHARLEY SAID YOU WERE PRETTY
GOOD AT CARDS, BUT I WAS BETTER.
I CAN TAKE CHARLEY THE BEST
DAY HE EVER LIVED
WITH YOU STANDING
ON HIS SHOULDERS.
TRY IT ANYTIME YOU SAY, COLONEL,
ANYTIME AT ALL.
I'LL BET THE WOMEN
SPOIL HIM SILLY.
YEAH.
NOT ONLY THE WOMEN
EITHER.
JEFF SAYS HE CAN CHARM THE GOLD
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR TEETH.
HOW IS JEFF, PAPA?
WELL, HE'S LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
AROUND HERE,
LOST HIS BITE.
NOT MUCH LIKE THE NIGHTGOWN YOU WORE
WHEN I PUT YOU TO BED.
OH, JEFF.
WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THE WAY
I FIXED UP YOUR ROOM, HONEY?
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
AIN'T IT, THOUGH?
I GOT MY IDEA FROM ONE OF THEM
MAGAZINES.
WELL, IF YOU WANT
ANYTHING, YELL.
OH, DON'T GO.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT BROCK.
WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW?
OH, JUST HOW HE'S BEEN.
WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING.
SAME AS ALWAYS. BROCK'S BEEN HAVING
A GOOD TIME FOR BROCK.
WHAT YOU DOING?
WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?
I'VE BEEN SAVING IT.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME SOME MORE
QUESTIONS, SARAH BETH?
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT HER. AIN'T YOU CURIOUS ABOUT
YOUR MOTHER? YOU NEVER THINK OF HER?
WHAT FOR?
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.
I DON'T KNOW
WHO SHE IS.
DON'T YOU EVER WONDER WHY
SHE'S NEVER COME TO SEE YOU?
YOU'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO SAY GOOD
THINGS ABOUT HER.
YOU'VE ALWAYS STUFFED YOUR EARS
WHEN I DID.
SHE GAVE UP A LOT WHEN SHE WENT AWAY.
AND SHE HASN'T GOT MUCH LEFT NOW.
HOW ABOUT PAPA?
HAS HE GOT ANYTHING LEFT?
HE'S GOT YOU.
HE'S GOT BROCK.
YEAH-BROCK.
PLEASE STOP WHISTLING.
10. I'LL RAISE YOU 20.
3 TREYS.
3 DEUCES
YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT, BOY.
NOBODY CAN BEAT THAT, KID.
THAT'S RIGHT, CHARLEY.
NOBODY EVER HAS. YOU OUGHT
TO KNOW THAT, BILL.
YEAH, I KNOW.
6. MISDEAL, ISN'T IT?
OH, HAVE YOU GOT 6, TOO?
5. I COULD HAVE USED ANOTHER.
LOOK, KID, GAMBLING IS MY BUSINESS.
YEAH.
AND I KNOW MY BUSINESS.
AFTER THIS, IF I'VE GOT 6 CARDS,
I'LL MAKE IT KNOWN.
SURE. YOU BET.
YOU DEAL.
ANY OF YOU BOYS SEEN CHAMBERLAIN
AROUND? JUDGE CHAMBERLAIN?
NO. WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HIM?
HIS OFFICE WANTS HIM.
TRY THE BANK.
FORGET IT, JOE.
HE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, CHARLEY.
ALL RIGHT, KID.
YOU'RE THE JUDGE.
JUDGE OF WHAT?
GO AHEAD. DEAL.
3, JUDGE.
THANK YOU, JUDGE.
3 FOR THE JUDGE.
I'LL LET YOU OFF WITH A LIGHT SENTENCE.
PAIR OF 9s.
PAIR OF DOGS.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A TWIN
BROTHER, JUDGE.
ALL RIGHT, BROCK, THE DOOR'S OPEN.
TEMPORARY ANYHOW.
WHO OPENED IT
FOR ME, BILL?
SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO SAY THANKS.
I DON'T KNOW THE PARTY.
BROCK, YOU'RE HOME!
PAPA, BROCK'S HOME.
WELL, WERE YOU STILL AS LUCKY?
OH, SURE.
I'M ALWAYS LUCKY.
STOP THAT.
PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.
LIKE?
OH, ANYTHING BUT
THAT FUNERAL MARCH.
PLAY SOMETHING WITH PEOPLE IN IT.
CAN'T HAVE A FUNERAL
WITHOUT PEOPLE.
HAD DINNER?
YEAH, ATE AT BEATTY'S PLACE
ON THE WAY OUT.
BROCK SAID HE WAS LUCKY AGAIN, PAPA.
REALLY? THAT'S FUNNY.
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE BOYS TOOK HIM.
THEY TRIED. I WAS PLAYING WITH
JOE HORTON.
HORTON? HE'S A BAD BOY. YOU
WANT TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.
I DID, IN ONE HAND,
ESPECIALLY.
WE BOTH DREW ONE,
ONLY I DREW FIRST.
GOT HIM RIGHT
IN THE BELLY.
YOU MEAN
YOU SHOT HIM.
NOT CONCLUSIVELY.
HE'S GOING TO LIVE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HOW'D THE FIGHT START?
AH, I HAD A FEW TOO MANY, I GUESS.
I DON'T REMEMBER.
I NEVER SAW YOU
THAT DRUNK.
THEN I'M A-LYIN'.
HOW LONG WERE YOU IN JAIL?
NOT LONG.
WHO GOT YOU OUT?
MCCURTIN?
HASN'T HE ALWAYS
BEFORE?
YEAH. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL
ME HOW THE FIGHT STARTED?
I TOLD YOU. I WAS DRUNK.
NOW, IF YOU'D RATHER I HADN'T
COME HOME, I'LL GET OUT.
I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T LIE, BROCK.
NOW, COME ON, LET'S GO
INTO TOWN.
AND FACE WHATEVER'S
GOT TO BE FACED.
NOT ME. I'M GOING
TO DENVER.
YOU'RE GOING TO SALT FORK,
BROCK,
AND GET THIS THING OVER WITH
AND THEN YOU'RE COMING BACK HERE.
AND IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
IF YOU SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME
HERE IN THE FUTURE.
YOU CAN'T RUN ME
ANYMORE!
I WASN'T CUT OUT FOR LIVING YOUR WAY
AND I'M SICK OF TRYING.
I'D RATHER BE STUFFED
IN A COFFIN!
I DON'T MIND THE SHOOTING SO MUCH-
I WOULDN'T GIVE MUCH FOR YOU IF
YOU COULDN'T DEFEND YOURSELF-
BUT JUMPING BAIL IS ANOTHER THING.
IT ISN'T SQUARE.
I WANT YOU TO GO INTO TOWN
AND STAND TRIAL ON YOUR OWN FEET.
CLEAR YOURSELF OR TAKE
THE CONSEQUENCES.
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO WORK IT OUT, BROCK.
WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING MORE
TO SAY TO ME, I'LL BE AROUND.
THAT WAS NICE.
THAT WAS FINE.
TAKE IT EASY.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
HURT HIM MORE THAN ANYONE.
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU?
TAKE IT EASY, SARAH BETH.
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING.
I GOT TO THINK.
HOW CAN A MAN THINK
WITHOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?
JIM HERE?
AROUND SOME PLACE.
OUT BACK, I GUESS.
WHERE'S BROCK?
HELLO, MR. MCCURTIN.
YOU TELL HIM ABOUT
THE SHOOTING, BROCK?
OH, HELLO, MACK.
SURE I TOLD HIM. WHAT'S THE MATTER?
HORTON DIED.
FIGURED HE WAS
TOO MEAN TO DIE.
I CAN GET YOU OFF
ONCE MORE, MAYBE.
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A GOOD REASON
TO SHOOT A MAN.
YOU HAD ONE,
DIDN'T YOU?
GOOD REASON?
WHY, SURE-THE BEST.
BETTER COME BACK IN WITH ME.
HAVE YOU TOLD
THE COLONEL?
I CAN'T FACE HIM.
I'VE GONE THAT ONE TIME OVER
BRINGING HIM BAD NEWS.
ARE YOU COMING?
NO.
THEN I'M FINISHED, BROCK,
AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED.
TOO MUCH FOR ME.
ONE LAST WORD-
I ADVISE YOU TO GET IN TOWN FAST.
SARAH BETH, TELL YOUR FATHER
I COULDN'T WAIT.
YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS YOURSELF OR
THE WAY YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL.
WHAT DID MR. MCCURTAIN MEAN,
"THE WAY YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL"?
HE GOT YOU OUT, DIDN'T HE?
NO.
WHO DID?
CHAMBERLAIN.
I GUESS HE FIGURES
THE YOUNG AND FOOLISH
SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE,
OR SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT, BROCK, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COVER UP WITH ME.
I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME.
WHEN?
FOR SURE WHEN I WAS 15.
HOW?
A LOT OF THINGS
PUT TOGETHER.
AND BEFORE I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL
THE LAST TIME, I KNEW YOU KNEW IT
AND I KNEW PAPA DID.
I COULD KILL CHAMBERLAIN.
THAT'S WHAT THE
TROUBLE WAS ABOUT.
THIS FELLOW I WAS GAMBLING WITH,
HE SAID A FEW THING.
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T
TELL THE COLONEL.
I COULDN'T LET HIM
KNOW THAT I KNOW.
OH, BROCK.
WE'VE BEEN AROUND A LOT
TOGETHER, THE COLONEL AND ME.
AND HE NEVER LET ANYBODY
EVEN THINK ANYTHING ONCE,
AT LEAST NOT OUT LOUD.
DON'T I KNOW.
I'M GLAD I KNOW THAT, TOO-
I MEAN, THAT YOU LOVE HIM.
IF I HATED HIM,
I'D BE ALL RIGHT.
THEN WE COULD WALK DOWN
THE STREET TOGETHER
AND I WOULDN'T MIND FEELING
HIM CRINGE-NEVER LET ON.
OH, I SHOULD HAVE GONE Movie AWAY
FROM HERE A LONG TIME AGO.
BUT HE'S HARD TO LEAVE.
NOW I GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE FAST.
DON'T RUN AWAY, BROCK.
MR. MCCURTIN COULD GET
YOU OFF, COULDN'T HE?
OH, SURE, EASY. THE JURY WOULDN'T
EVEN LEAVE ITS BOX.
THEN FACE IT LIKE
PAPA WANTS YOU TO.
EVER BEEN TO A TRIAL,
SARAH BETH?
LOTS OF THINGS COME OUT OF TRIALS.
WHOLE MESS COMES OUT.
SALT FORK WOULD EAT
THIS UP WITH A SPOON,
AND HE'S HAD ENOUGH.
GO ON, SARAH BETH, SIT DOWN AND
PLAY A TUNE BY YOURSELF.
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.
AND TELL THE COLONEL NOTHING.
JEFF SAID MCCURTIN WAS HERE.
WHAT DID HE WANT?
NOTHING.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
FIRST LAP OF
MY TRIP TO DENVER.
GET DOWN OFF THAT HORSE, BROCK.
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
WELL, SARAH BETH, I'LL TRY TO
UNDERSTAND WHY HE HAD TO GO.
I DIDN'T TRY WITH SOMEONE
ELSE A LONG TIME AGO.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SORRY.
WELL, COLONEL, THEN
IF BROCK AIN'T HERE
WE JUST GOTTA FIND HIM
AND TAKE HIM IN.
WHY?
I THOUGHT MCCURTIN
TOLD YOU.
HORTON DIED.
SORRY, COLONEL.
THINGS FALL THAT WAY
SOMETIMES, BILL.
YEAH.
YOU SURE HE AIN'T HERE?
YOU CAN LOOK.
I... I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED THAT,
COLONEL. GOOD NIGHT.
WHY IS BROCK FRIGHTENED, SARAH BETH?
DOESN'T HE KNOW MACK CAN GET HIM OFF?
BUT HE KNOWS HE CAN'T GET
YOU OFF.
THE MAN BROCK SHOT,
HE CALLED BROCK NAMES.
NOT PRETTY NAMES,
EITHER.
THEY'D SOUND AWFUL AT A TRIAL,
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE TRUE.
BROCK THOUGHT-HE WANTED TO
SPARE YOU SOMETHING.
HE CAN'T SPARE ME
ANYTHING.
IT SEEMS NONE OF US CAN
SPARE THE OTHERS ANYTHING.
YOU GO TO BED.
I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM.
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE HE DOES SOMETHING.
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE SOME SHERIFF GETS HIM.
HE'S A GOOD BOY,
SARAH BETH.
YES. I'M GLAD WE KNOW HOW GOOD.
YOU FIND HIM, PAPA.
I'LL FIND HIM.
GET YOUR AFTERNOON STAR-
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE, LADY.
LATEAFTERNOON STAR.
THANK YOU, SIR.
RIGHT OVER HERE-
GET YOUR LATE AFTERNOON STAR!
AFTERNOON STAR! LATEST NEWS AND
THE LATEST PAPER!
RIGHT HERE. THAT THE IDEA.
THANK YOU, SIR.
LATE AFTERNOON STAR!
RIGHT OVER HERE! GET
YOUR LATE AFTERNOON STAR!
HERE COMES THE COLONEL.
HE'S IN THAT
CABIN, COLONEL.
YOU CAN'T GO DOWN THERE, COLONEL!
THE BOY'S GONE CRAZY!
GO ON BACK!
NO ONE'S TAKING ME, AND
THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO!
STAY THERE, OR I'LL DROP
YOU! I MEAN IT!
YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO TURN AROUND!
I'LL COUNT 3!
HURRY IT UP!
OH, DAD. WHY AM I
CALLING YOU DAD?
YOU USED TO CALL
ME THAT, BROCK.
NOT SINCE I GOT OLD
ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER.
GROWING UP-THAT'S
GREAT, ISN'T IT?
DON'T TALK.
DON'T TALK.
YOU DON'T SCARE
WORTH A NICKEL, DAD.
DOCS ALWAYS TRY SOMETHING.
LIE STILL, KID.
LIE STILL. NOT WHILE I'M STILL
BREATHING IN AND OUT.
LYING STILL COMES LATER.
NOT MUCH LATER, THOUGH,
HUH, DOC?
HELLO, SHERIFF!
SOMEBODY LEFT
A NOTE FOR YOU.
RIGHT SIDE OF YOU.
BROCK.
YOUR SISTER SENDS
HER LOVE, SON.
THE GOOD GIRL.
GOOD, BRIGHT GIRL.
SHE TOLD ME, BROCK.
SHE TOLD ME WHY YOU
DUCKED OUT.
AND, BROCK...
YOUR MOTHER...
THERE'S SOMETHING...
DAD, LET'S GO DOWN
TO CHARLEY'S, HMM?
LET'S DRINK ALL THE PLACE
UNDER THE TABLE.
AND THEN WHEN THERE'S
JUST ME AND YOU LEFT
I'LL DRINK YOU UNDER.
ASK CHARLEY.
HOW ABOUT IT?
DA-DAD...
DAD.
I GOT IT FOR YOU,
LAST STOP, MA'AM.
GOT ANYTHING
FOR ME TO PICK UP?
NO. NOTHING TODAY.
I BEG YOUR PARDON, IS THERE
A TRAIN LEAVING
FOR SAN FRANCISCO TOMORROW?
ONE AT 11:00 O'CLOCK TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.
AND SO WE'LL COME TO
PAY OUR LAST RESPECTS
AND TO SAY GOODBYE
TO BROCK BREWTON
BELOVED SON OF JAMES BREWTON
AND LUTIE C. BREWTON.
THIS YOUNG MAN HAS
DEPARTED FROM OUR MIDST.
THE LORD GAVE.
THE LORD HATH TAKEN AWAY.
LET US PRAY.
COME IN.
JUST PUT THE COFFEE
ON THE TABLE, PLEASE.
YOU'RE SARAH BETH.
YES.
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THAT.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, AND THEN
I'M GOING TO GO.
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS HERE?
I HAVE A ROOM AT THE HOTEL.
THE CLERK TOLD ME.
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU HURT
POP ANYMORE!
HE CAN'T STAND ANYMORE.
MAYBE YOU COULDN'T HURT HIM,
EVEN IF YOU TRIED.
MAYBE THERE'S NOT ANYTHING THAT
CAN HURT HIM,
NOT AFTER BROCK.
I HOPE SO.
BECAUSE NOBODY CAN STAND
ANYMORE, EVEN HIM.
SO MAYBE THE PAIN'S
OVER NOW.
UNLESS YOU BROUGHT HIM MORE.
HAVE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU
WANT OF HIM?
NOTHING.
I CAME TO HELP BROCK.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE-
I... I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THE TRAIN
WAS ALMOST HERE.
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO SEE
YOUR FATHER, SARAH BETH.
I MIGHT TRY IF I THOUGH
I COULD MAKE UP
A LITTLE TO HIM. AND TO YOU FOR
ALL THE YEARS,
BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T.
HE TRIED TO TELL ME
HOW HE FELT,
HOW THE GRASS WAS SOMEHOW
GODLY TO HIM.
HE TRIED TO TELL ME
AND I DIDN'T HEAR.
AND HE WAS RIGHT.
THOSE YEARS ARE GONE,
AND MY CHANCE WITH HIM.
I'LL LEAVE TONIGHT, SARAH BETH,
BUT I'M NOT SORRY
I CAME NOW,
BECAUSE I'LL TAKE SOMETHING
BACK WITH ME
WHICH MEANS
A GREAT DEAL TO ME:
THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT HE HAS YOU-
YOU TO FIGHT FOR HIM,
BE THERE WHEN HE NEEDS YOU,
TO BE WHAT I WASN'T
STRONG ENOUGH TO BE.
HE DIDN'T COME TO ST. LOUIS
FOR NOTHING.
AND NOW, WHEN HE'S LOST
IT ALL, EVERYTHING,
WHEN HE NEEDS SOMETHING
HUMAN AT LAST,
YOU COME INTO THE FIELD.
NO, HE DIDN'T COME
TO ST. LOUIS FOR NOTHING.
AND ALL AT ONCE
THAT GIVES ME... PEACE.
A KIND OF HAPPINESS EVEN.
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
JUST ONE THING.
SOME NIGHT WHEN HE'S SITTING
ON THE PORCH, SARAH BETH,
GIVE HIM A KISS FROM ME.
OH, DON'T...
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME, COLONEL.
THE BUCKBOARD WITH
SARAH BETH GET IN?
I MISSED SEEING HER START.
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
GO ON IN THE HOUSE, COLONEL.
SARAH BETH?
PAPA, COME HERE.
PAPA, COME HERE.
MOTHER WANTED TO BE
WAITING FOR YOU HERE, PAPA.
THE WAY SHE USED TO BE.
LUTIE?
YOU'RE WELL?
YES, JIM.
AND YOU?
YOU LOOK AS YOU ALWAYS DID.
DO I, JIM?
PAPA.
IT WAS A HARD THING
FOR HER TO GO THROUGH,
BUT SHE'S ONE
IN A THOUSAND.
NO ONE ELSE WILL EVER BE LIKE HER.

BLOOD ON THE MOON
Who's that?
Put a light on yourself.
With what?
Man, man. I didn't know anyone was here.
- Well, I had a fire.
- I couldn't have stopped 'em if I'd seen it.
I don't think I've seen you around here before, have I?
Nope.
- You c ome over the peaks?
- Yeah. With an outfit.
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for you to clear out of my camp.
Then I'll gonna turn in, if I can find my blankets.
My camp just below.
Maybe you better come along.
We can make it double that far.
I guess I can do with a cup of coffee.
Hey it's me, Bart.
Who is he?
I don't know.
I was bringin' my gather down the creek when they cleaned out his camp.
So I brought him along.
You come over the peaks?
That's right.
Why didn't you come to the pass?
There's no law says a man has to stick to a wagon road, is there?
My men caught your horse.
It's branded "Lazy J".
I don't know it.
Don't you?
Wait a minute, Cap.
Make a fellow feel right at home don't you?
All right my name is Lufton,
John Lufton.
This is Cap Willis, my foreman.
A month ago, nobody would've asked you any questions.
It's different now.
Who are you?
Jim Garry. "Lazy J" is Texas brand.
Headed for Sun Dust?
That's right.
You know anybody there?
Nope.
Alright. I apologize for my steers.
We'll replace your outfit.
Make yourself comfortable.
Give him something to eat, Joe.
- Rotten night.
- Yeah.
Sorry we have to be so rough on you Garry, but you're a loose rider.
We gotta watch them these days.
- Little argument over grazing land.
- Oh.
Yeah. For five years now, I've been supplying the beef to feed the Indians here on the Reservation.
This year they've got new agent.
Fellow named Pindalest.
He's rejected my beef and he's kicking me off the Reservation grass.
That doesn't explain about the loose riders.
No, but I haven't got any graze to move to except what I used to claim in the Basin across the river.
And there seems to be a little difference of opinion now as to who owns that.
Me or the homesteaders that have been drifting in.
I'm moving back.
They'll fight.
Yeah, I reckon they will.
A newcomer moved in this summer.
He's got 'em organized.
Name's Riling.
Still doesn't explain about the loose riders.
He's bringing in gun men.
Nobody can blame you for being careful.
I'm afraid you don't get it.
- Get what?
- This.
It's work for me or - keep on riding.
And if I don't?
I'll give you a day in Sun Dust and then you'd better drift.
Sleep on it, Garry.
Much obliged for the outfit.
Working for me Garry?
No, I guess I'll be drifting.
Well, it's your choice.
D'you mind dropping a note at Block house with my women folk?
That's my place over in the Basin.
It's on your way.
Glad to.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Hold it! I'm riding through.
Come on out and talk.
Don't care who you kill, do you?
Maybe that'll cool you off.
- Got a note from John Lufton.
- I'm Carol Lufton.
- You're working for us now?
- No.
Bringing herd across river at Rock Ford tonight. - Dad</ I>
Did Dad say when he was coming down from the Reservation?
- No, ma'am.
- Thank you.
Stop right there.
You're the man that shot at me by the river.
Yeah, I guess I am.
Well I'm gonna show you how it feels.
Put that gun down, Amy.
Amy stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! You hear?
Have you gone crazy?
- What's going on here?
- Ask him.
I was only giving him back a little of what he gave me.
- What about it?
- She's right.
Why has Dad had to guard at the river for a week if it isn't to keep the riders from crossing?
- What are you doing here?
- He brought a note from Dad.
Well, I tried to tell her but she wouldn't give me a chance.
Alright you delivered the note.
Now, get out.
Well, for once you bit off more than you can chew.
- That him?
- Yeah, what do you think?
- Hmm, maybe.
- Maybe my foot, Manker! You gotta get hit on the head with it?
- Lufton threatened to get one, didn't he?
- Well you ain't sure it's him.
I cut his sign going into Lufton's ranch this morning and I cut it going out.
John Lufton's got a right to hire a range detective if he wants to, Milo.
Not to watch us, he ain't.
Well, let Riling handle it.
And no shooting.
Take the third stall.
The boy'll bring you some hay.
Any idea who that fellow is?
"Lazy J" is the brand but I don't know it.
He say anything?
- He asked where he could find Tate Riling.
- Riling?
- I'll take it at the table Barney.
- Sure.
Lufton's watcher just drifted in.
- Cattle detective?
- What else?
- He asked for Riling.
- Riling?
If he's Lufton's watcher, what d'you figure he wants with Riling?
Let's find out.
Yeah. Why not?
But how? Riling ain't here.
Sure he is.
Where?
Right here. Eh, Nels?
Well, let's wait 'til Riling gets here.
We wouldn't want to make no mistake.
Alright, Nels.
Maybe you want the law to come in here and find out what we're planning to do.
So he can go back and tell Lufton.
Alright, Milo, alright.
I'll tell Barney.
Know where I can find Tate Riling?
Back table.
Ace, Queen, Mitch.
Tate Riling?
That's me.
I'd like to talk to you.
Go ahead.
These are my friends.
I'm looking for a riding job.
Who said I was hiring riders?
I heard it.
You hear what I'm hirin' them for?
I heard that too.
Why yes.
Dumb play boys.
Stay set Army.
He's headin' for the street.
Mr. Riling, Lufton's watcher's in town.
Asking for you.
And he wanted a ridin' job with us, Tate.
- Then go get him.
- There he is.
Jim Garry!
Hello, Tate.
This is Jim Garry. The man I sent for.
He's no range detective.
What went wrong, Jim? What Happened?
Who started this?
Ask these jokers here, Tate.
If that's Garry, what's he doing at Lufton's?
Were you at the Lufton's place?
Yeah he was. I seen him.
That's right. I delivered a not from him to his women folk.
What about it?
Well it's Lufton's outfit that's tryin' to run us out of the country, Jim.
Am I supposed to know that?
Why no. I forgot.
I never wrote Jim about our fight with Lufton.
I told him I needed him and asked him to come on up.
Now stop chewin' leather and go and get yourself a drink.
Sam old Jim, when lightning strikes you're there.
It wasn't a fair test.
Come on, let's get you a room.
It's good to see you again Jim.
I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm here.
Yeah. I heard things haven't been breaking too good lately.
Well, that's a bootless job - trail driving.
I told you that we split up two years ago.
Understand you fin'lly got your own herd.
And two weeks later I saw 'em strung out along the bottomlands. Dead of the Fever.
We'll forget it. There's money in this deal.
Big money.
- Barney, how about a room for my friend here?
- Sure.
I wouldn't wish one on him if was a friend of mine though.
Oh. This has got your name on it.
Somebody fired it through the back window during the ruckus.
We're goin' out tonight fellows.
I know where Lufton's crossing.
- How do you know?
- Never mind, I know.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.
Drink up, Jim.
Wait here, I'll be right back.
I suppose you'd like to know what this is all about?
I have been kinda wondering, yeah.
Well I'm not gonna tell you, Jim.
I'm gonna show you.
Come in.
Jim, this is Mr. Pindalest. United States agent for the Ute Indians over at the Reservation
This is Jim Garry, my partner.
How do you do?
You didn't tell me before about a partner.
Well I'm telling you now.
Before we go on any further,
I want to understood how he'll figure in this.
You mean money?
Don't worry Pindalest.
I'll share with Jim.
Hmm.
Well, here's the, uh, item we were talking about the other day.
Think you'll find it satisfactory.
United States dollars are usually satisfactory, aren't they?
Now look. I told you Garry is my partner, Pindalest.
What I know, he knows..
So relax and sit down.
No, I won't stay.
Scared?
Scared?
Just cautious, Riling.
Well that's our partner, Jim.
Cautious...
And this is our working capital, courtesy of the United States Government.
There's enough there to buy me 2,500 head of Lufton's beef, four dollars a head.
That's cheap enough, isn't it?
It's too cheap. Where is the catch?
There isn't any.
You, um, met Lufton, you say?
Yeah, I camped with him last night.
Did he tell you that Pindalest has ordered his cattle off the Reservation?
Yeah. He said he'd refused his beef.
And did he tell you that the army from Fort Liggett, has orders to seize the cattle if they're not off the Reservation by the first of November?
No he didn't tell me that.
Well that's the layout Jim.
I've organized these two bit ranchers to fight any move Lufton makes to push his herd across the river and into the Basin here.
The ranchers'll fight because they figure they're fighting for their own range.
But the truth is, they'd be fighting for me.
Now withut any graze to move to,
Lufton'll be caught on the Reservation and his herd seized.
So what does he do?
Sell?
To me. Cheap.
Because he'd rather get a little money than lose everything.
Sounds like you've got him over a barrel.
I have!
I buy 'em cheap and sell 'em back to the Government through Pindalest for full contract price.
Your cut will be ten thousand dollars.
What do I have to do to earn it?
Lufton's tough. My ranchers aren't.
You'll make up the difference.
I see.
I've mixed up a lot of things, Tate.
But up to now, I've never been hired for my gun.
Can you afford to be particular?
No I guess I can't.
Now you're talking, Jim.
I'll meet you down in the lobby in 10 minutes.
Come on, slow poke.
Don't you want to know if Dad got across?
Of course.
What's the matter?
Did I get you out the bed too early?
I'm worried about dad.
I hope he didn't have trouble crossing last night.
Could only be trouble if Riling found out about it.
Nobody's crossed here.
Looking for someone, Miss Lufton?
So you're one of 'em?
- I guess dad wasn't so wrong about you after all.
- Wrong?
He must've spotted you for one of Riling's gun men the minute he saw you.
Funny isn't it Riling?
But not to you. By now Dad's probably got his herd across the river some place else while you wait here at Rocky Ford to throw him back.
- Is that why we're here?
- Isn't it?
Simply because Dad was smart enough to give this saddle tramp a not that he was sure to read.
He knew he'd tell you and decoy you over here.
How do you like it now, Kris?
You and your son?
Why you aren't even being led by a smart crook.
We're only fighting for what belongs to us, Miss Amy.
You didn't fight for it before Riling gave you the idea.
Why didn't you talk to dad, Kris?
Talk to him.
You use to work for him.
You know he's not unreasonable.
Call it unreasonable to kick us off our land?
I don't believe I've seen you around here before.
- You fighting for your own graze too?
- No ma'am.
And you?
I thought you were all old timers, fighting for land you settled on, Kris?
At least that's in the open now.
Paid gunmen against working riders.
You did read that note, didn't you?
No.
You're a poor liar.
Yes.
Well. Lufton's across the Massacre.
John Lufton's no fool, mister.
Garry did not read that note.
- Then where did you get the tip?
- None of your business, Milo.
I got a wrong tip and I won't get another.
Well if you don't like it, Milo.
Just ride it on out.
Lufton's across the river with that herd.
Yeah, sure. But steers have got legs.
They can be driven back.
The thing to do is find 'em before Lufton can get 'em scattered.
After that we can move.
Didn't you notice how them four always stick together?
Why not?. Reardan and Shotten work for Riling.
Garry's a friend just came in to help.
I can buy me that kind of a friend for $75 a month and no questions asked.
You know, Lufton's smart.
Yeah he's smart enough to spot me.
He had spotted Shotten and Reardan before I even knew they were there.
They are a couple of beauties.
Who are they?
Doesn't matter who they are, Jim.
The thing that matters is, they don't scare easy.
Well, it's pretty crude.
Not so crude.
I've made everybody swallow it but Lufton, and I'll make him swallow it too.
Shotten, Reardan and me.
Hired gunmen.
Shotten and Reardan will get paid in gold eagles.
You get paid in thousands.
Yeah. Only difference between us is the price.
All right boys, cut for town.
I'll be in touch with you.
Tate, I didn't know it was a trick of Dad.
I swear I didn't. Until I heard Amy say it.
Of course you didn't, darling.
Forget it.
It's done and now we've got to fix it.
But I'm glad in a way.
I couldn't bear it this morning when I though you and Dad were fighting.
It isn't for you, Carol.
But I have to do what I'm doing.
You see that, don't you?
- Yes, Tate.
- You see, I'm a poor man, darling.
Money has to come hard to me.
Nothing for me to do but join up with men just like myself and fight for what little I've got.
I tried to make Dad see both sides.
But he's just as sure he's right as you homesteaders are.
We've got to fight.
But he's across now.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna ask you to risk your dad's life, darling.
But I am going to ask you to help.
Find out where he's holding the herd that he crossed. and get word back to me as soon as you can.
You won't let any harm come to Dad, won't you?
You know you can trust me, darling.
Still a lot easier when we go through the gap.
- We ought to make it by noon.
- Yes.
I scatter 'em in the scrub pinion west of Avery's patch.
Amy!
What the devil are you doing here?
You didn't think I'd stay home when you're this close.
This is no place for you.
I told Bart to tell you girls I'd be home by noon.
I told 'em and it didn't do no good.
She was bent on coming along.
I couldn't wait.
All right, Cap, get 'em started.
Bart says you crossed without any trouble?
Yeah. We're primed for it but didn't come.
I think I know why.
Did a rider name of Garry drift into the ranch yesterday with a note?
You mean that hired gunman of Riling's?
So I had him pegged right.
Too bad, he was a nice seeming fellow.
Too nice to read that note.
But he did.
Do you think this Garry's a killer?
Joined up with Riling, didn't he?
Get out of here, Amy!
I'll make Riling remember this.
They'll run 'till they're worn out.
Four days to the deadline.
It'll take us a week to round 'em up and get 'em off the Reservation again.
It's young Barden.
I hope it wouldn't come to this.
Just a month ago me and him went to a shindig together.
Yeah, he was a nice boy.
Well, what do you want?
It's about your Barden.
He was killed on the raid.
I figured maybe that's what happened when he didn't come home.
I was with him when he got hit.
Nothing I can do.
It's a big price to pay for a little bit of graze.
Too bad you had to get mixed up in this fight, Barden.
I joined up with the other small ranchers
'cause I figured their fight was my fight.
We ain't being paid to fight, mister.
I'm sorry about your son, Mr. Barden.
You can believe that if you want to.
Sure. Sure.
I've lived here more than of half my life with my wife and my son.
She died about four years ago.
And now...
Now he's gone.
Go on in the Hotel, Amy.
I told you to ride on through.
- So you did?
- You're time's up, get started.
- Get out of here, Amy.
- No.
- Go on into the hotel.
- No.
Don't move, Lufton.
Your drift, Shotten.
Get that girl out of there.
I said, drift.
What are we waitin' for?
But this is what Riling wants.
He said so.
That's your horse, Reardan.
Get moving.
I ain't taking orders from you.
All right, Reardan. Any time you want.
Make up your mind.
I won't wait.
You won't be this lucky next time, Lufton.
I don't get it, Garry.
I just don't get it.
You're riding on, aren't you?
I'm glad. Not for us, but for you.
I want to thank you for this.
I want to apologize too, for what I said to you.
Don't let a man's whim fool you.
I haven't.
COMMISSARY
12 MILES
What do you want, amigo?
Whiskey.
Would you be looking for me?
I ain't looking for anybody, mister.
Is that you, Kris?
I heard about Fred.
I'm sorry, Kris.
I'll make Lufton pay for that.
What good'll that do? Fred's...
Fred's dead.
It'll make me feel better.
Did you come all the way over here to tell me that?
No. I missed you this morning.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Why are you?
I'm leavin' the country.
But Kris, the fight's almost won.
Lufton's herd is stampeded half way up the Three Braves.
Who cares?
Hey Jim, where have you been?.
I've searched the country for you.
How'd you find me?
Settlemeir said you took the Commissary road.
I took a chance.
What's up?
Let's have a drink. I've got news.
Give me a glass and a handful of cigars and then get out.
On the level, Jim.
What are you doing here?
Running out.
Any reason?
Two. Shotten and Reardan.
I never heard of you running away from a pair like that.
- Well, I. I never did.
- Then why?
They were gonna kill Lufton in cold blood when I stepped in.
I'm glad you did.
Are you?
Jim, what's eatin' you?
Why we've got more at stake here than a bag of marbles.
You mean, you have.
Jim, Lufton isn't dead.
He isn't even hurt.
And after that stamped he hasn't got a chance.
- Then why bother about me?
- Because, I need you.
You don't think Lufton'll do business with me, do you?
No.
No he'd rather lose his herd.
Exactly.
But today you stepped in and saved his life.
He won't forget that.
So when you ride up with an offer, he'll take it.
Because he has to.
Why not?
It's, something you wouldn't understand.
Try me.
It starts with your double cross of a bunch of poor jugheaded homesteaders and the hiring of gun hands.
It goes on to you making love to man's daughter to get her to turn against her own father.
And your try for Lufton yesterday...
It goes past that to the death of Kris Barden's son.
And it winds up right here. with Reardan waitin' outside to see if I go with you or he shoots me in the back.
I've seen dogs that wouldn't claim you for a son, Tate.
All right, get off.
I said, get off.
Hold it.
Give him time.
Can you make it to your horse?
Get out.
Why'd you do it?
I always wanted to shoot one of you and he was the handiest.
Get out.
What are you doing here?
I want to see Lufton.
Why you dirty saddle stiff!
Get out of here, quick.
Lufton'll have to run me off.
I don't need orders from him to cut down on you, Now get out!
What is it?
I'm looking for your father.
- Oh he's...
- Careful Miss Amy.
It don't matter to him where your father is.
It's all right, Ted.
That's a bad cut.
Come inside. I'll fix it.
Sit down.
Tate Riling?
Is he - dead?
No.
I keep remembering what you said yesterday in Sun Dust.
Was this a whim, too?
This business with Riling?
It was a pleasure.
What brings you back?
Gall, for one thing, John.
I got in a little jangle with Riling down at Commissary last night.
I'm through with him.
- Well?
- You may not believe me, Lufton
I want to tell you what you're up against.
Then it's up to you.
I already know what I'm up against.
You don't know that Pindalest aims to buy your herd, do you?
He rejected it.
He won't reject it when Riling offers it to him.
Sure. Riling and Pindalest planned it together.
Pindalest's part of the deal was to order you off the Reservation.
Riling was to prime the homesteaders to keep you out of the Basin.
Do you figure you can round up your stuff and cross it before the deadline?
- No
- And rather than let the Army take 'em you'd sell and take the loss wouldn't you?
Not to Riling.
But to a stranger like me with cash in his pockets.
That's the deal. I was supposed to make the offer with Riling's money.
I don't believe it.
No, he's right, Cap.
I'd be a fool not to sell.
Well, I'll drift.
I just thought I'd let you to know.
Jim, wait a minute.
You don't tell a dead man he's dead.
You came here for something else, didn't you?
Well, I did had kind of an idea.
- Might not be what you'll like.
- Let's hear it.
Suppose the deadline was put off for a week.
That would give you time to round up your herd.
- Deadline hasn't been put off.
- It can be.
How?
Pindalest would laugh at me if I asked him to.
He wouldn't laugh at me.
No I'm not hiring a gunman to save my herd or anything else.
Jim!
Jim, please wait a minute. He didn't understand what you were saying.
Please don't leave until he does.
He understood all right. Now step back.
I'm gonna follow you 'till you turn back.
You'll have a long ride.
I'm header for Texas.
All right.
We better quit this.
- You'll come back with me and give Dad a chance to apologize?
- No.
But you better go. They'll be looking for you.
I won't go unless you got with me.
Well, I'm gonna turn in.
I'm not leaving.
Well you're not staying here.
- Will you go back with me?
- No.
Then I won't go.
- I'll give you one more chance.
- No
You'll go now, unless you want more of that.
I don't want more of it, Jim.
But I won't go.
You really meant it, didn't you?
That much?
Jim, I know you better than you think.
You've been in hard luck and you've made mistakes.
You hated those mistakes.
But you never admitted them except to yourself.
Like this mess with Riling.
You never liked it.
That's why you walked out on him.
Today you, tried to do something to make up for it.
And Dad threw it back in your face.
He thought you meant to kill Pindalest.
I didn't think so.
I know why you did it.
You thought it would help wipe out the past.
You're a proud man, Jim.
But this is the wrong kind of pride.
If you ride on to Texas you're lost.
Cap's gone on ahead to get the drive started.
Only hope Riling doesn't get wind of what Garry's up to or there'll be the devil to pay.
He knows what kind of man he's dealing with, Dad.
Yeah, I reckon he does.
At any rate, it's our only chance.
So you're going to let Dad risk everything just because Garry sold you a wild lying scheme.
Lie?
You don't believe what Jim told me?
No, Why should I?
He's nothing but a cheap gun man. A killer!
- That's not so. Jim wouldn't...
- Jim?
Yes. Jim!
What's the matter with calling him Jim?
He's no more a gun man than I am.
Amy, what is this?
He's trying to help us and I'll stick up for him to you or anyone else.
Sounds a little stronger than sticking up for him.
Maybe it is.
But a gun man, Amy.
A man that'll go up against hired killers.
How did get get so expert?
You've thought of that?
More than you know.
Nothing made him come back and help us.
Except wanting to get even with Riling.
Not it's not that. He's really decent.
He...
Does he love you?
I don't know.
You're a fool, Amy.
He'll break your heart.
Come in. Come in.
Who is it?
Jim Garry.
Oh oh fine, Sit down.
I'll be out in a minute.
Been riding all day and was just taking a little nap.
- Drink?
- Don't mind if I do.
Well...
How are things?
Fine, Mr. Pindalest.
Just fine.
I brought that news you've been waiting to hear.
Everything went off without a hitch, huh?
Well, maybe one little hitch.
You might say.
What's that?
Lufton wants more money.
How much more?
Three thousand dollars.
Riling said his selling price to you still held.
This was just a loan.
Well, if that's all that holding us up there's nothing to worry about, huh?
Success.
You know. This might cause a little trouble after all.
I don't keep that much cash here at the agency.
Lufton wants cash.
Means I'll have to ride over to Sun Dust with you and draw it out to the bank.
Riling figured you'd likely would.
How's the pass? Clear?
A little snow.
It will probably hold off.
Well, I'll throw some stuff together.
I'll get out of here
Oh I came close to forgettin'.
Riling says call off the Army.
Lufton'll likely run over the deadline roundin' up some beef we stampeded for him.
Riling says he doesn't want to explain to the Army about that.
Good idea.
I'll get a man out to Fort Liggett with a message right away.
Tate, what happened to you?
A fight. Where have you been?
I couldn't get out.
I know who you fought with,
It was Jim Garry.
How do you know?
He's been at the ranch.
Tate, I want to talk to you 'bout something.
That's why I came here tonight.
Well?
What is it?
Garry told us something very interesting.
He said that you and Pindalest had cooked up this fight with Dad to crowd him off the range so he'd sell his cattle to you cheap.
Is that true?
So, Garry told you that, did he?
Is that true?
What else did he tell you?
This sounds good.
That you wanted him to make the offer to Dad.
Did he tell your father that?
Yes.
Tate, you haven't answeredr me. Is this true?
Of course.
You mean you've been making those poor homesteaders that it's their rights you're fighting for?
I wanted money for us.
This is a way to get it, a lot of it.
Money your Dad could spare.
Tate, look at me.
Do you love me? Have you ever loved me?
What do you want me to say? Sure.
Don't lie to me.
You used me to beat Dad.
I betrayed him for you.
Now that's all you ever wanted,
It's all you ever counted on, isn't it?
I wouldn't say that.
Would you go in town with me this minute.
And marry me like you promised?
Not until I get money to support you.
What's funny?
I was thinking of something
I told Amy this morning.
Wasn't that the Lufton's girl?
- What's she doing here?
- None of your business.
What are you doing here?
I thought you said Garry quit
Well?
What's he doing at the Reservation?
- The Reservation?
- Yeah, yeah.
Nels saw him there this morning.
Heading for the agency.
Feel kind of stiff, don't you?
When we get to Sun Dust,
I'll sleep for a week.
We won't be getting to Sun Dust for quite a while.
We'll just stay right here.
What do you mean?
You've been taken in, Pindalest.
Riling never sent me to see you.
I came to take you and hide you out until the deadline.
- And Lufton did not agree to sell?
- No.
Also he's rounding up his cattle right now with no Army to bother him.
But you're a Riling man.
What? I'm with Lufton now.
You can't get away with it, Garry.
Riling's no fool.
He'll be on our trail in twenty four hours.
Let him.
When he does find out what's happened, he'll pull his men off to hunt you
That'll make it all easier for Lufton.
I'd take it easy with that If I were you Pindalest. it will not last out the week.
Don't move.
Maybe I won't nurse this quite as long as you figured.
If you're plannin' on movin out, you're going alone.
I'm giving you a chance to change your mind.
I'm staying here.
Now look, I can lick you and you know it.
Keep this up, you'll end up with a sore head, and that's all.
Suit yourself.
All right.
You win. Untie me.
Come on.
Come on cheer up, Pindalest.
Now we can start looking for a place to make camp.
- Toma! Where are you?
- Over here, Riling.
- Toma, Sing out!
- Riling, Over here!
Send the Indian to Fort Liggett. with the message to bring the Army on.
- Hey, Milo.
- Yeah?
- Get back to the Basin.
See the boys hold Lufton on the Reservation
'till the troops get there.
What about Garry?
We'll take care of him.
Carol.
You've got to stop this.
I know.
I'll make some coffee.
I could have seen Dad and told him.
You must stop thinking about it.
Only, if we knew what was happening to him.
You just got to believe in what
Jim's doing would work.
He has a good chance.
Do you really think so?
Of course I do.
Why don't you lie down for a while.
I'll bring you some coffee.
Why Kris, I thought you'd left the Basin.
I did Miss Amy but...
I guess I've lived around here a little too long.
It got lonesome.
I knew you couldn't leave us for good.
Well I'm back to stay and I come over to ask for your help.
I maybe ain't got no right asking considering who it's for but..
Do you remember that young fella you combed out over at Rocky Ford the other day?
He's been hurt.
Jim Garry?
Came home this morning found him lying on the floor in my shack.
He got a knife stuck in him.
I'll go get dressed.
It's me, Jim.
Lie still.
You gotta get out of here.
No, Jim.
Kris.
Kris, tell here to get out of here.
I'm going to fix this up.
He's asleep.
Good.
So him and your dad are in this together?
Yes.
Young lady, you're going on a ride.
Riling's on his trail. He'll probably end up here sometime today.
That's why Garry wanted, to get you out of here.
We gotta get help.
Do you know where your dad is?
No I don't.
Oh Kris, I don't. We haven't heard from Dad for days.
Well you better find him.
What about Jim?
If they show up I can stand 'em off till your Dad gets here. Don't let that worry you.
Where you gonna look for him?
I don't know. Somewhere south.
- I'll try and pick up the trail of the herd and follow it.
- Good.
What are you doing here?
I might ask you that?
Barden home?
Yes.
Who else is in there?
Nobody.
You're a lovely little liar.
All right fellas, let's take a look.
Hold that the door.
Here take this.
- Riling?
- Yes. And Pindalest and Shotten.
Look here, Kris.
Before this goes any further tell Riling, I'll go with him.
These walls are good and thick. They can't burn us out.
And we got plenty of cartridges.
He won't quit till he's got me and he'll kill you both to do it.
So wel let him shoot you, just to save our necks.
Then tell here she's coming out.
They'll let her through
No. I won't go.
Make her go.
Why do you think she risked her neck to get back in here if it wasn't on account of you?
Why do you think I want to get her out?
Same reason, I reckon.
He's right, Amy.
But it wouldn't work. Not even if you'd have me.
Now will you go?
No.
Look, I've been fiddlefooted and no good all my life.
I'm not askin' any woman to take that.
I knew that when I came here.
That's what I am, Amy. That's me.
Don't you see how useless talk is?
I'm here and I'm staying.
- Jim?
- Yes?
Jim, what are you doing up?
I'm going out there and try and get a crack at them.
No let me talk...
We can probably hold out a few more hours, but...
You ain't going out there just to save our necks.
I'll try and save my own too.
We might as well face it.
They're not gonna give up.
It's not likely anybody'll be along to help us.
Then I'll go.
I got a score to settle with Riling myself.
No, Kris.
It's me Riling's after.
I'd like to finish this my own way.
- You will let him go Miss Amy?
- Yes she is.
Where are they exactly?
They're all scattered out.
Riling's over on the left of 'em trees.
The other two are closer to the corral.
If I just make it to the corner of the corral
I can circle around and get behind them
But they'll see you.
Soon as I get out you open up on 'em.
That'll draw a return fire. Their powder flash will blind 'em for a couple of seconds, thats all I need.
- Ready?
Hold it, Miss Amy. Hold it!
I think he made it.
That last shot came from another direction.
- Do you want to get hit?
- But I got to know.
Hey, Shotten?
Pindalest?
All right Riling, It's just you and me now.
It's a pleasure, Jim.
For me, Tate.
Same old Jim.
When lightning strikes, you're there.
You and me together, Jim.
We coulda licked 'em
But you, you always had a conscience breathing down your neck.
Jim!
Riling's dead.
Shotten too.
And Pindalest?
No I do not think so. He's over there.
- Dad. - Carol told me you were here.
She was afraid there might be trouble.
- Where's riling?
- He's dead.
Well Lufton, don't look like you're gonna get Riling to do much talking now.
I'm going to have you arrested for murder.
Put up a fair fight, John. And
I'll tell that to the sheriff.
Or anybody else that wants to know.
Lufton was telling us about a little deal that you and Riling cooked up to swindle him out of his cattle.
- What about it?
- I had no deal with Riling.
Don't forget I was in on it too.
Well boys, that's the man you've been fighting for.
Get your horse. Me and you are going to have a little talk with the marshal.
I guess we been a pack of fools, Lufton.
Say fellas. I've got a jug I been saving for a special occasion. This looks like it.
What do you say if we...?
Garry I guess I was wrong about quite a few things.
Yeah I was wrong about a few things myself.
We've been plenty stubborn.
That's going to make two stubborn men in the family.
Well I guess Kris was right.
This is a special occasion.
Come on.
Say, buddy, will you stake a fellow...
Hey, mister, will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
- State lottery, señor?
- Beat it. I ain't buying no lottery tickets.
4,000 pesos is the big prize.
Get away from me, you little beggar.
The whole ticket is only 4 pesos.
It's a sure winner.
I ain't got 4 pesos.
Buy a quarter of a ticket for 1 peso silver.
If you don't get away from me,
I'll throw this water right in your face.
Then one tenth of a ticket, señor, for 40...
Señor, buy one twentieth.
One twentieth costs you only 20 centavos.
Look, señor, add the figures up.
You get 13.
What better number could you buy?
It's a sure winner.
- Yeah, how soon's the drawing?
- Only three weeks off.
Give me a twentieth so I don't have to look at your ugly face.
Come again next time.
I always have the winners, all the lucky numbers. Good luck.
Thirteen.
Excuse me.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
- It's hot.
- Yeah.
What a town, Tampico.
You said it, brother.
If I could get a job that'd bring enough to buy passage...
I'd shake its dust off my feet soon enough, you bet.
If I was a native,
I'd get a can of shoe polish... and I'd be in business.
They'd never let a gringo.
You can sit on a bench till you're three-quarters starved.
You can beg from another gringo, or even commit burglary.
You try shining shoes in the street... or peddling lemonade out of a bucket and your hash is settled.
You'll never get another job from an American.
Yeah, and the natives would hound and pester you to death.
- Some town to be broke in.
- What town isn't?
Can you stake a fellow American to a meal?
Hey, mister.
Will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
Such impudence never came my way.
Early this afternoon, I gave you money.
When my shoes were being polished,
I gave you more.
Now you put the bite on me again.
Do me a favor.
Go occasionally to somebody else.
- It's beginning to get tiresome.
- Excuse me. I didn't know it was you.
I never looked at your face, just your hands and the money you gave me.
Beg pardon. I promise
I'll never put the bite on you again.
This is the very last you get from me.
Just to make sure you don't forget your promise, here's another peso.
- Thanks, mister.
- But from now on... you have to make your way through life without my assistance.
Hey, buddy, will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
I won't give you a red cent.
If you want to make some money
I'll give you a job.
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.
I got a job if you want.
It's hard work, but good pay.
- Did you ever rig a camp?
- Sure.
The ferry's making off, one of my men hasn't shown up.
I don't know what's happened to him.
He's probably drunk in some dive.
- What's the pay?
- $8 a day.
Don't just stand there.
Make up your mind, the ferry doesn't wait.
- I'm your man.
- Come on.
- Hello, there.
- Hello, yourself.
Okay, you guys, get aboard.
Take it your way.
What's the matter with you two?
Can't you take it?
It's 130 in the shade, and there ain't any shade up there on that derrick.
Just figure you're a couple of millionaires in your own private steam bath.
And the sooner we're through... the sooner we'll be back in town drinking cold beer.
We finish within two weeks,
I'm giving you fellas a bonus.
Yeah, it's coming to us working 16, 18 hours a day like we do.
Don't go crying to your mamas.
What do you want?
I'm paying top salaries and a bonus.
What about our pay anyway, and when do we get it?
- I ain't seen a buck out of you yet.
- You'll get your dough, all right... don't worry about that, when we get back to Tampico.
What could you do with money out here anyway, except gamble and lose it?
You'll be paid as we step off the ferry.
The agent was supposed to be here with the dough.
Don't know what could've happened.
But don't worry.
I'll go to the office and pick up the money.
You men stay here.
Any objection to a couple of us coming with you?
Don't you trust me?
You think I'd run out on you?
I don't think you'd do that.
But I ain't got a cent, not even enough to buy me a glass of beer.
Say, you two guys meet me over at the Cantina Madrid.
It's 2:15 now and I'll be over there no later than 3:00.
Pat McCormick.
He comes here from time to time.
I haven't seen him lately.
Pat McCormick?
What about Pat McCormick?
- He's supposed to meet us here.
- Does he owe you any money?
Say, how long you guys been around Tampico, anyway?
What's that got to do with it?
Only foreigners and half-baked Americans fall for McCormick's tricks.
How do you mean?
I mean, he hires dumb guys like you to work for him.
When it comes time to pay off, he takes a powder.
How much we got left of that $10 he gave us, Dobbsie?
- That's not even enough for one bed.
I know a joint that's full of rats, scorpions and cockroaches.
The cots are only 50 centavos a night.
Have another...
...jobs that were a dime a dozen ain't to be had at all.
Streets are full of guys... pushing each other over a meal.
Gold in Mexico? Sure there is.
Not 10 days from here by rail.
The mountain's waiting for the right guy to discover and take her treasure.
The question is: Are you the right guy?
Real bonanzas are few and far between.
They take a lot of finding.
Answer me this, will you?
Why is gold worth some $20 an ounce?
- I don't know. Because it's scarce.
- A thousand men go searching for gold.
After six months one of them's lucky.
One out of the thousand.
His find represents not only his own labor but that of 999 others to boot.
That's 6,000 months, 500 years... scrambling over mountain, going hungry and thirsty.
The gold is worth what it is 'cause of the human labor that went into finding it.
- Never thought of it like that.
- There's no other explanation.
Gold ain't good for nothing except for making jewelry and gold teeth.
Gold's a devilish sort of thing.
You start out to tell yourself you'll be satisfied with $25,000 worth.
So help me Lord and cross my heart.
Fine resolution.
After months of sweating yourself dizzy, few provisions, finding nothing... you finally come down to $15,000, then $10,000.
Finally you say,
"Lord, let me just find $5,000 worth...
"and I'll never ask for anything more the rest of my life."
$5,000 is a lot of money.
In this joint it seems like a lot.
But if you made a real strike, you couldn't be dragged away.
Even the threat of death wouldn't keep you from adding $10,000 more.
$10,000, you'd want $25,000.
$25,000, you'd want $50,000.
$50,000, $100,000. Like roulette.
One more turn, you know.
Always one more.
It wouldn't be that way with me.
I swear, it wouldn't.
I'd take only what I set out to get.
Even if there was still $500,000 worth... lying around, waiting to be picked up.
I've dug in Alaska and Canada and Colorado.
I was in the British Honduras,
I made my fare back home... and almost enough over to cure me of the fever I'd caught.
Dug in California and Australia.
All over the world practically.
Yeah. I know what gold does to men's souls.
You talk as though you struck it rich sometime or other, pop.
How about it?
Then what are you doing in here, a down-and-outer?
That's gold. That's what it makes us.
Never knew a prospector yet that died rich.
Make one fortune, he's sure to blow it trying to find another.
I'm no exception to the rule.
Sure I'm a gnawed old bone now but don't you guys think the spirit's gone.
I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe if anybody's willing to share expenses.
I'd rather go by myself.
It's best to go alone.
But you got to have a stomach for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.
But going with a partner is dangerous.
Murder is always lurking about.
Partners accusing each other of all sorts of crimes.
As long as there's no find, the noble brotherhood will last.
But when the piles of gold begin to grow, that's when the trouble starts.
I wouldn't mind a little of that kind of trouble.
I think I'll go to sleep... and dream about piles of gold... getting bigger and bigger.
Do you believe what the old man... who was doing all the talking at the Oso Negro... said the other night... about gold changing a man's soul so that he ain't the same kind of a guy... that he was before finding it?
Guess that all depends on the man.
That's exactly what I say.
Gold don't carry any curse with it.
It all depends on whether or not the guy who finds it is the right guy.
The way I see it... gold can be as much of a blessing as a curse.
Look who's coming out of the Hotel Bristol.
Is that Pat McCormick or am I seeing things?
It's him.
- Let's get him.
- Let's get him hard.
Why don't you and me go and buy me something?
I could use a new pair of shoes.
Hello, fellows, how are you?
Glad to see you.
- Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Curtin, Señorita...
- López.
López. I want you guys to come and have a drink with me.
I've got business to attend to with these men.
You go back up the hotel and wait.
I won't be long.
Okay.
Fellas, let's have that drink.
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
Three shots of rye.
Make mine brandy, Three Star.
- Two brandies.
- Rye is good enough for me.
I suppose you're wondering about that money that's coming to you.
The fact is I haven't been paid off on that contract myself.
If I had the money, you'd get it first thing.
I'll put you both on my next contract.
It will come through by Monday and we can set out Friday.
Here's mud in your eye.
We want what's coming to us.
We want it right here and now.
- But didn't I just tell you...
- You better come across.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 25º% .
I guess I can make it 30º% .
And the balance, say, the middle of next week?
Nothing doing. Right here and now.
Every cent or you won't walk out of here.
You'll be carried out.
Let's don't stop being friends.
How about another drink?
Two more brandies.
Put the bottle on the bar.
If you want to get us liquored up...
No, I'm just inviting you to have a friendly drink with me.
- I'm licked, boys.
- Give us our money.
Yeah, give us our money.
I can't see.
- That's it, ain't it, Curt?
- Yeah, that's it.
Let's beat it before the law arrives.
Here's for the drinks and the use of the cantina.
- You know something, Curt?
- What?
We ain't very smart, hanging around Tampico waiting for a job.
Money's getting shorter every day... and soon we'll be right back where we were, on the bum again... pushing guys for dimes, sleeping around in freight cars.
That's right. Got any ideas?
That old man in the Oso Negro started me to thinking.
What about?
Why not try gold-digging for a change?
It ain't any riskier than waiting around here for a break... and this is the country where the nuggets of gold are crying for you... to take them out of the ground, make them shinin' coins... on the fingers and necks of swell dames.
One thing, living in the open is cheaper than it is here in Tampico.
Our money'd last longer.
The longer it lasts, the greater our chance of digging something up would be.
We'd have to have equipment, all right.
Picks and spades, pans, burros.
Wonder how much it would all cost.
- That old man would know.
- Yeah, he could give us some pointers.
He's too old to take along.
We'd have to pack him on our backs.
You can't tell about some of those old guys.
It's surprising sometimes how tough they are.
I don't know what gold looks like in the ground.
I've only seen it in jewelry store windows and people's mouths.
You know anything about prospecting?
Not much when you come right down to it.
We might have real use for an experienced guy like that old-timer.
Let's go hunt him up right away.
Will I go? What a question.
Of course I'll go.
Any time, any day,
I was waiting for somebody to ask me.
Out for gold? I'm always at your service.
I got $300 ready cash in the bank.
$200 of it all set to invest.
Last money I got.
When it's gone, I'm finished.
If you don't take a risk, you can't make a gain.
How much dough you guys got to put in?
I've got $150 and Curtin's got the same.
$500 ain't hardly enough to buy tools, weapons and essential provisions.
What do we need weapons for?
Meat's one thing and bandits another.
Bandit country's where we'd be going.
We need $600 between us.
- That much?
- Can't you dig up any more?
Not a red cent.
Give me my money, señor!
10º% I get for selling the winning ticket.
Get away from me, will you?
Please, señor.
Whoever draws the lucky number... gives a present to the seller...
I don't want any lottery ticket!
If you don't, you have bad luck the rest of your life.
What? Wait a minute.
What did you first say?
Why, he's trying to tell you he sold you the winning ticket.
Hey, wait a minute.
This what you mean?
- You say it's the winner?
- 200 peso prize.
Where?
- That's my number.
- Sure enough.
Just look at that fat, rich, printed number.
That's the kind of sugar poppa likes.
200 pesos.
Welcome, sweet little smackeroos.
Here, son, here's a present for you with my blessing.
Would you like to shake the hand that bought that ticket?
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, yourself.
You stand to profit out of this the same as I do.
How do you make that out?
Didn't he just say we needed $600?
That's what we've got now, ain't it?
- Yeah, but...
- But what?
- Why are you putting up for me?
- This is an all-or-nothing proposition.
If we make a find, we'll be lighting our cigars with $100 bills.
If not, the difference between what you and I put up... ain't enough to keep me from being where I was this afternoon:
Polishing a bench with the seat of my pants.
Put her there, part.
We'll buy our burros at Perla and head northwest away from the railroad.
It's no use looking near a railroad... or any kind of a road at all... because construction engineers examine every bit of ground around the road... while they're building them.
We got to go where there's no trails... where no surveyor or anyone who knows anything of prospecting has been before.
The best place to go to is... where any salaried person wouldn't go, because he wouldn't want to risk his hide.
I got three of them!
How many did you get?
- A couple.
- I'm one up. I bet I got more than you did.
I got three. Nice shooting?
That bullet hole's two inches from my head. That was close.
The bullets were sure flying thick and fast in here.
It sounded like a swarm of bees here.
That bandit with the gold hat,
I had my sights on him, nice as you please.
The train gave a jolt and I missed.
Wish I'd got him.
Big boulder on the track so train stop.
Bandits got big surprise because soldiers on the train waiting for them.
Not many passengers get killed.
Here's where we're bound for.
Don't show whether there's mountain, swamp or desert.
That shows the makers of the map don't know.
Once on the ground, we open our eyes and look around.
Blow our noses, too.
Believe it or not, I knew a fellow... who could smell gold like a jackass can smell water.
What's all that about?
We're going into country very wild and dangerous.
Have to cut through jungles... and climb mountains so high they rise above the clouds.
Tigers so strong they can climb trees with burros in their mouths. Good.
Glad to hear such tall tales 'cause it means few outsiders have set foot there.
Well, let's get going.
If there was gold in them mountains, how long would it have been there?
Millions and millions of years, wouldn't it?
What's our hurry?
A couple of days more or less ain't going to make any difference.
Remember what you said back in Tampico... about having to pack that old man on our backs?
That was when I took him for an ordinary human being... not part goat.
Look at him climb, will you?
What gets me is how he can go all day in the sun without any water.
Maybe he's part camel, too.
If I'd known what prospecting meant...
I'd have stayed in Tampico and waited for another job to turn up.
- What's the matter?
- Look.
Look at it glitter. It's yellow, too, like...
Gold.
Come back, we've found something!
Look, Curt, there's a vein of it, here, in this rock.
Look here. Look, it's all around.
What else could it be?
Only gold shines and glitters like that.
We've struck it, Curt.
Look, from the looks of things... we've struck it rich.
Look, it's all over here.
- We found a what do you call it...
- Mother lode.
- That's right.
- Howard!
Come on. Look.
Here, look at this rock.
It's full of gold. Veins of it.
This stuff wouldn't pay your dinner for a carload.
It ain't gold?
Pyrite. Fool's gold.
Not that there ain't plenty of the real stuff here.
We've walked over it four or five times.
A place yesterday looked like rich diggings, but the water... for washing the sand was 11 miles away.
The other places, there wasn't much gold to pay us a good day's wages.
Next time you strike it rich, holler for me... before you start splashing water around.
Water's precious.
Sometimes it can be more precious than gold.
Burro.
- What's up?
- Norther, looks like.
A "norther"? What's a "norther"?
Big winds from the north this time of year... when they blow hard, this desert country stands right up on its hind legs!
There's only a few more miles of this heavy stuff.
Pretty soon we'll be out of this valley.
You fellows, how about some beans?
You want some beans?
Going through some mighty rough country tomorrow. You better have some beans.
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking we ought to give up... leave the whole outfit... everything behind.
Go back to civilization.
What's that you say? Go back?
Tell my old grandmother!
I got two elegant bedfellows who kick at the first drop of rain... and hide in the closet when thunder rumbles.
What great prospectors.
Two shoe clerks reading about prospecting for gold... in the Land of the Midnight Sun, south of the border or west of the Rockies.
Shut your trap or I'll smash your head flat!
Go ahead, throw it. If you did, you'd never leave this place alive.
Without me, you two would die here more miserable than rats.
Leave him alone.
Can't you see the old man's nuts?
Nuts, am I? Let me tell you something, my fine bedfellows.
There's nothing to compare you with.
You're dumber than the dumbest jackass.
Look at each other.
Did you ever see anything like yourself for being dumb specimens?
You're so dumb... you don't even see the riches you're treading on with your own feet.
Don't expect to find nuggets of molten gold.
It's not that rich.
Here ain't the place to dig.
It comes from someplace further up.
Up there.
Up there's where we've got to go.
- Is that it?
- That's it, all right.
Gold, I mean.
Sure don't look like I thought it would.
- Not much different from sand.
- Yeah. It's just like plain sand.
It don't glitter. I thought it would.
It will when it's refined by some other guy.
All we got to do is mine it and get it back there.
Gold ain't like stones in a riverbed.
It don't cry out to be picked up.
You got to know how to recognize it.
The finding ain't all. Not by a long shot.
Got to know how to tickle her so she'll come out laughing.
Yeah, it's mighty rich. It'll pay good.
- How good?
- About 20 ounces to the ton.
- That's $20 an ounce.
- How many tons can we handle a week?
Depends on how hard we work.
We better pitch our camp down the mountainside.
Why, when the digging's here?
Anyone comes by, we say we're hunters, and get away with it maybe.
- Wouldn't it be easier to file a claim?
- Easier but not so profitable.
An emissary from a big mining company would be here soon... with a paper in his hand showing we had no right to be here.
How does it feel to be men of property?
The tanks'll leak some at first... until the boards begin to swell and close the seams.
I sure had some cockeyed ideas about prospecting for gold.
It was all in the finding, I thought.
I thought you just had to find it, pick it up, put it in sacks... and carry them off to the nearest bank.
You're learning. Pretty soon
I won't be able to tell you a thing.
- Tank full yet?
- Right to the top.
Open the sluice gate.
How much do you figure it to be now?
About $5,000 worth, I reckon.
When are we going to start dividing it up?
Anytime you say.
Why divide it at all? I don't see any point.
We're all going back together when the time comes.
Why not wait till we get paid and then divide the money?
Either way suits me. You fellows decide.
I'm for dividing it up as we go along.
Make each guy responsible for his own goods.
I'd just as soon have it that way.
I don't like the responsibility of guarding your treasure.
Who asked you to?
That's right. You never asked me.
Only, I thought I was the most trustworthy of the three.
You?
How come?
I said the most trustworthy. As far as being the most honest, no one can say.
I don't get you.
Suppose you're charged of taking care of the goods.
One day I'm deep in the brush and Curtin's on his way to get provisions.
That'd be your chance to pack up and leave us in the cold.
Only a guy that's a thief at heart would think me likely to do a thing like that.
Right now, it wouldn't be worth your while... but when the pile's grown to 300 ounces, think of such things you will.
How's about yourself?
I'm not quick on my feet any longer.
You're a lot tougher than when we started out.
By the time the pile's grown to be really tempting...
I won't be able to run half as fast as you.
You'd catch me and string me up in no time.
That's why I think
I'm the most trustworthy.
Looking at it that way,
I guess you're right.
Maybe it'd be a good idea... to cut the proceeds up three ways every night.
It'll relieve you of a responsibility you don't like.
Swell by me.
After we got a couple of hundred ounces... it'll be a nuisance carrying bags around our necks.
Each of us will have to hide his share from the others.
And after that, he'll have to be forever on watch that his hiding place's not found.
What a dirty, filthy mind you've got.
Not dirty, baby.
Only I know what kind of ideas... even supposedly decent people get when gold's at stake.
All right.
Here she goes three ways.
Dobbs!
Howard, come quick!
He's coming around.
Lay still a minute till you get your senses back.
What happened?
Part of the mine caved in on you.
Got a knock on the head.
No bones broken?
I don't think so.
- Who pulled me out?
- Curtin did.
I owe my life to you, partner.
Forget it.
What'll you do with your hard-earned money... when we get back and cash in?
I'm getting along in years.
I can still hold up my end... when it comes to a hard day's work, but I'm not the man I was once.
Next year, next month, next week, by thunder, won't be the man I'm today.
I think I'll settle down in a quiet place... get a little business, hardware, grocery store... spend the better part of my time reading comics and adventure stories.
One thing's for sure.
I won't go prospecting again... wasting time and money trying to find another gold mine.
How about yourself?
What plans have you, if any?
I figure on buying some land and growing fruit. Peaches, maybe.
How did you come to settle on peaches?
One summer, when I was a kid...
I worked as a picker in a peach harvest in the San Joaquin Valley.
Boy, it sure was something.
Hundreds of people, old and young.
Whole families working together.
At night, after a day's work... we used to build big bonfires and sit around and sing to guitar music.
Till morning sometimes.
We'd go to sleep, wake up and sing, and go to sleep again.
Everybody had a wonderful time.
Ever since then I've had a hankering to be a fruit grower.
It must be grand watching your own trees put on leaves... come into blossom and bear.
Watching the fruit get big and ripe on the boughs, ready for picking.
What's all that about?
We're telling each other what we aim to do when we get back.
Now me, I got it all figured out what I'm gonna do.
Tell us about it, Dobbsie.
First off, I'm going to a Turkish bath to sweat and soak... till I get all the grime and dirt out of my system.
Then I'm going to a haberdasher and gonna get myself a brand-new set of duds.
Dozen of everything.
Then I'm going to a swell cafe... order everything on the bill o' fare and if it ain't just right... or maybe even if it is,
I'm gonna bawl the waiter out... and make him take the whole thing back.
What's next on the program?
Well, what would be?
If I were you, I wouldn't talk or think about women.
It ain't good for your health.
Yeah, maybe you're right, seeing how the prospects are far off.
You know what?
We ought to put a limit on our take, agree between us... when we get so much we pull up stakes and beat it.
- What do you think the limit ought to be?
- Say $25,000 worth apiece.
$25,000, small potatoes.
How much do you say?
$50,000 anyway,
$75,000 would be more like it.
That'd take a year if the vein held out, which wouldn't be likely.
What's a year more or less when that kind of money is to be had?
$25,000 is plenty as far as I'm concerned.
Enough to last me the rest of my lifetime.
Well, sure, you're old, I'm young.
I need dough and plenty of it.
$25,000 in one piece... is more than I ever expected to get my hands on.
Small potatoes.
There's no use making hogs of ourselves.
Hog, am I?
Maybe you don't know, but I'd be within my rights... if I demanded half again as much as you get.
How come?
There's no denying I put up the lion's share of the cash.
So you did, Dobbsie, and I always meant to pay you back.
In any civilized place the biggest investor gets the biggest return, don't he?
That's one thing in favor of the wilds.
Not that I intended to demand it, but I'd be within my rights if I did.
Next time you call me a hog just remember... what I could've done if I'd wanted to.
I think it'd be wise not to put things strictly on a money basis.
Here you are, Dobbs.
What I owe you with interest.
I just don't like being called a hog, that's all.
Don't scare me like that.
I might have let you have it.
Out for a midnight stroll?
Tiger around,
I went to check on the burros.
- So?
- What's the matter?
- I think I'll see if the burros are all right.
- Go ahead. Help yourself.
- What's up?
- Nothing's up.
Where is Dobbs?
Poking around in the dark out there.
He's sure taking a long time out there.
I think I'll go have a look-see.
Where's Curtin?
He's out there somewhere.
Said he was gonna have a look-see.
It's my turn again but I won't take it... if you stop worrying about your goods and go to bed.
We got work to do tomorrow.
Can't catch me sleeping.
Don't you ever believe that.
I'm not that dumb.
The day you try to put anything over on me... it'll be a costly one for both of you.
Any more lip out of you and I'll up and let you have it.
If you know what's good for you, you won't monkey around with Fred C. Dobbs.
You ought to see Dobbs.
He's talking to himself a mile a minute.
Something's eating him all right,
I don't know what.
He's just spoiling for trouble.
"We're running short of provisions,
Dobbsie.
"How about you going to the village?"
Who does Howard think he is, ordering me around?
What's that, Dobbs?
- Nothing.
- Better look out.
It's a bad sign when a guy talks to himself.
Yeah? Who else am I gonna talk to?
Certainly not you or Curtin.
- Fine partners you two are.
- Got something up your nose?
Blow it out, it'll do you good.
Don't think you two are putting anything over on me.
- Take it easy.
- I know what your game is.
You know more than I do.
Why am I elected to go to the village instead of you or Curtin?
Don't think I don't see through that.
You two are together against me.
The two days I'd be gone... would give you lots of time to discover where my goods are.
If you fear along those lines... why don't you take your goods with you?
And run the risk of having them taken from me by bandits?
If you run into them, you'd be out of luck anyway.
They'd kill you for the shoes on your feet.
So that's it. Everything's clear now.
You're hoping bandits will get me.
That would save you a lot of trouble, wouldn't it?
And your consciences wouldn't bother you none neither.
All right, Dobbs, forget about it.
Just like I thought.
- What's the idea?
- Put your hands up.
I've a good mind to haul off and pump you up, chest and belly alike.
Would you mind telling me what this is about?
It won't get you anywhere playing dumb.
Well, I'll be.
- So that's where your goods are hidden?
- Hey, what's the trouble here?
Seems like I accidentally stumbled on Dobbsie's treasure.
Accidentally? Why were you trying to pry up that rock?
I saw a gila monster crawl under it.
Brother, I got to hand it to you.
You can certainly pick up a good story when you need one.
Okay, I'm a liar.
There isn't a gila monster under there.
Let's see you stick your hand in and get your goods out.
- Go ahead.
- Sure I will.
But you try any bad moves...
Don't worry. I'll stay right where I am.
I want to see this.
Reach in and get your goods.
If you don't, we'll think you're yellow, won't we, Howard?
They never let go, do they, Howard, once they grab onto you?
You can cut them in two and the head will still hang on till sundown, I hear.
By that time the victim doesn't usually care 'cause he's dead.
- Isn't that right, Howard?
- I reckon.
Why don't you stick your hand in and get your treasure?
Couldn't be because you're scared... after the way you've been shooting your mouth off?
Show us you ain't yellow.
I'd hate to think my partner had a yellow streak up his back.
I'll kill you, you dirty, thieving...
Okay, Howard, I got him covered.
Another bad move out of you and I'll blow you to kingdom come.
Howard, turn that rock over, will you?
The federales are very efficient.
Yeah. Bandidos, eh?
Yeah, seems between them they had a diamond ring... pearl earrings, a lot of money and a railway ticket... with the date of the Aguascalientes train robbery on it.
They've been here several days, drinking, shooting...
The villagers are afraid to go out of their huts.
Where are they taking them now?
To the cemetery.
The federales don't operate in our American way.
They're not fingerprint experts, but they can follow any trail.
Against them, no hideout is any use.
They know all the tricks of the bandits.
You can bet your sweet soul they'll trace down... every last one of that group that attacked the train.
It'll take time, months maybe, but they'll do it.
Not many Americans get around this way.
You're the first
I've bumped into in a long time.
That so?
- Mighty rugged country hereabouts.
- Yeah.
My name's Cody.
I'm from Texas.
- What's your game?
- I'm a hunter.
- Professional?
- Yeah.
What all do you hunt?
Tiger cats, anything of commercial value.
How long did you say you'd been in these mountains?
A few months.
Ever seen anything that looked like pay dirt?
I've a hunch there's loads of the real goods up in those mountains.
No, I know the whole landscape around here.
If there'd been gold, you can bet I'd have seen it.
There's nothing doing here for gold.
I can look at a hill five miles away... and tell you if it carries an ounce or a shipload.
If you haven't found anything...
I'll come with you, put your nose in it.
There's indications in the valley, lots of indications.
By tracing the rocks,
I find they come from a ridge... washed down by the tropical rains.
- You don't say so.
- Yes, I say so.
So much for those bandits.
You gotta hand it to the Mexicans when it comes to swift justice.
Once the federales get their mitts on a criminal... they know what to do.
They hand him a shovel, tell him to dig.
When he's dug deep enough... they tell him to put the shovel down, smoke a cigarette and say his prayers.
In another five minutes he's being covered over with the earth he dug out.
Yeah, you gotta hand it to them all right.
I meant what I said about going along with you. Those are my burros.
I'm ready to start if you'll let me go with you to your camp.
Thanks anyway, but I prefer going it by myself.
Good luck.
I went way around, stayed on hard ground which wouldn't show the tracks.
Every time I hit a high point and looked
I'd see he was still following me.
I guess it's only a matter of time till he shows up here.
- I move we tell him straight off to beat it.
- Now, no, that'd be foolish.
He'd sit for an hour playing the innocent and then report us to the officials.
Once they come, we can't stay or take our goods with us if we left.
There's nothing else to do but kill him the minute he appears.
No crime to visit these mountains.
He may be a guy that likes to wander.
You can't shoot him for that.
If you were to shoot him it might come out.
We don't have to shoot him necessarily.
We can push him off a rock and claim it was an accident.
Just who's gonna do the pushing, you?
We'll toss for it.
You're sure he was trailing you, are you?
- Absolutely.
- How come?
Because there he is.
Come over by the fire.
I know quite well, you fellas, I'm not wanted here.
Even after what you told me...
I couldn't resist the desire to sit and jaw with an American.
Why don't you go where Americans want to talk to you?
Durango isn't too far off.
They got one of them American clubs there.
I'm not after that.
I've got other things on my mind, more important.
So do we. Don't make any mistakes.
Our biggest worry is your presence here.
We got no use for you.
We don't even want you for a cook or a dishwasher.
No vacancies, understand?
In case I don't make myself clear, you'll be doing yourself a favor... packing up and getting out tomorrow morning.
Go back where you came from.
Take our blessings with you.
Thanks.
Go ahead. Help yourself. We're no misers.
We don't let guys starve to death.
Tonight, you're our guest.
But tomorrow morning...
Iook out, no trespassing around here, you know?
"Beware of the dogs." Get it?
I got myself five foxes and a lion while you were away at the village.
- How are the hides?
- Pretty good.
- Where'd you hit them?
- Right through their eyes.
Excuse me for butting in, but there's no game here worth going after.
It wouldn't take a week for a hunter... to clean up all around for five miles in each direction.
Yes, there's no good hunting here.
That's why we made up our mind to leave... so that we could look for something better.
Yes, stranger, you're dead right.
Awful poor ground.
It took us some time to find it out.
Poor ground, you say?
Depends on what you're looking for.
For game, yes.
Mighty good ground for something else.
What might that be?
Gold.
That's a good one.
I told you in the village, there's no gold around here.
If there was one single ounce of it,
I'd have seen it, believe me.
If you haven't found any gold here, you're not as smart as you appear to be.
Well, maybe, you're right.
Who knows?
We never thought about gold.
Gives me an idea.
Guess I'll sleep on it.
I'll hit the hay.
Yeah. Me, too.
See you in the morning, mister.
I can't figure this bird out.
Is he wise to us or not?
Whether he is or not, he looks fairly harmless to me.
- Looks can be mighty deceiving.
- No denying that.
I'm keeping my boots on this night.
Might take it in his head to murder us in our sleep.
- Anything can happen. I'll tell you what.
- Well, then?
You guys go to sleep and I'll be watchdog for a few hours.
Then you both can take your turns.
- Okay. Got your gun handy?
- Yeah. Right here.
Good morning, friend.
Where'd you get the water to make coffee?
- I took it out of the olla.
- You did, did you?
We didn't carry that water here for you to make coffee.
- I didn't know water was so hard to get.
- You know it now.
I'll fill it up for you.
What's up?
I caught this guy stealing our water.
The next time I'll let it out of you through little round holes.
I thought I was among civilized men who wouldn't begrudge me fresh water.
Who's not civilized?
I could easily do the same for you.
It's not settled yet who'd come out on top.
This time I took it.
Thanks for your kind attention.
If I was you, stranger,
I'd pack up and go while the going's good.
I mean to stay right here.
The brush and the mountains are free, aren't they?
Sure. That's right, whoever's first on the spot.
That holds for hunters, but not for gold miners.
Unless they have happened to have registered their claim.
Who says we have a claim to register?
Whatever you say or don't say, tomorrow I start to dig for gold here.
I know you guys can bump me off any minute... but that's a risk worth running considering the stakes.
Let's lay all our cards on the table.
As I see it, you guys have to do one of three things:
Kill me, run me off or take me in with you as a partner.
Let's consider the first.
Another guy may come along tomorrow.
Maybe a dozen other guys.
If you start killing them... how far are you prepared to go?
Ask yourselves that.
Also, don't forget, the one actually to do the bumping off... would forever be in the power of the other two.
The only safe way would be for all of you to drag out your cannons... and bang away at the same instant like a firing squad.
We wouldn't stop at anything to protect our interests.
I claim killing me isn't it.
But, of course, that's for you to decide.
As for choice number two... you run me off,
I might very well inform on you.
We'd get you if you did that.
We'd get you if we had to go all the way to China.
25º% of the value of your find is the reward I'd get.
And that would be mighty tempting.
It's a strong argument in favor of number one.
I don't deny it.
But let's see what number three has to offer.
If you take me in as a partner, you don't stand to lose anything.
I'll not ask a share in what you've made so far, only in the profits to come.
What do you say?
Mind, stranger, letting us talk this over among ourselves?
Not at all. Go ahead.
I have to look after my burros anyway.
- What do you think?
- Sending him away is out of the question.
Either we bump him off or make him a partner.
F.C. Dobbs ain't a guy that likes being taken advantage of.
Do the mug in, I say.
He told us how, didn't he?
All of us hold out our cannons and let him have it.
What do we gain by bumping him off?
If he was asking to share in what we made it'd be different.
I don't mind being taken advantage of... if it isn't money out of my pocket.
And whoever else comes along... they're to be invited in, too.
Come one, come all?
You got a point there.
No question about that.
But killing...
- What's the matter, ain't you up to it?
- Sure, I'm up to it.
Let the majority decide.
What's your vote, partner?
For or against?
For.
Let's make it short and sweet for him.
So it's number one, is it?
Better take a look down that hill first.
I can't make out what they are.
They must be soldiers.
So that's your stinking game, is it?
Informing. I knew you were an informer.
I knew it all the time.
You're wrong, brother.
This means all our funerals.
What's that?
If it's what I think it is, may the Lord be with us.
They're not soldiers, they're bandits.
After guns and ammunition, not gold.
Some villager must have told them about the American hunter.
They don't look like soldiers to me, either.
They are bandits.
We better start thinking of a way to defend ourselves.
We can hide in the rocks but we'll lose the burros and the whole outfit.
The best thing is to fight.
You have good eyes.
Stay here on this lookout... for the time being and watch their movements.
You herd all the burros in that thicket there.
Dobbs, we'll wrap up all our belongings and dump them in the trench.
They're turning onto the trail.
- How many of them are there?
- About a dozen.
They'll be an hour getting here so we better eat something.
Come on down, friend.
Look, Howard.
The one in the gold hat, remember?
Yeah, the man in the train robbery.
They think whoever was here is gone.
Some want to go back down the mountains, others want to stay... and use this site as headquarters to raid the villages.
How about pouring it into them?
- Bumping off as many as we can, real fast?
- No, let's hold our horses.
We are federales.
You know, the mounted police.
If you are the police, where are your badges?
Badges? We ain't got no badges.
We don't need no badges.
I don't have to show you any stinking badges.
Better not come any closer.
We didn't try to do you any harm.
Why don't you try to be a little more polite?
Give us your gun and we'll leave you in peace.
I need my gun myself.
Throw that old iron over here.
We'll pick it up and go on our way.
You go anyway without my gun, and go quick.
All right.
Look here, amigo, you got the wrong idea.
We don't want to get your gun for nothing. We want to buy it.
Look, I have a gold watch with a gold chain... made in your own country.
The watch and the chain, they're worth at least 200 pesos.
I'll change it for your gun.
You better take it.
That's a good business for you.
You keep your watch, I'll keep my gun.
Oh, you'll keep it? You will keep it?
We won't get it?
I'll show you.
Anybody get hurt?
Looks like we won that round.
- That guy with the gold hat, ain't he...
- We spotted him, too. The train robber.
- Maybe they got enough?
- I doubt it.
Since they know there's four guns, they'll be more determined than ever.
- What do you suppose they'll pull next?
- No telling. All we can do is sit tight.
Cody, are you all right?
He's dead.
Got it right through the neck.
One less gun.
Chopping wood for camp, that's funny.
If they're up to what I think they are, it ain't funny.
- What's that?
- They're building moving barricades.
An old Indian trick.
They crawl and push the barricades.
You can't see where to shoot.
I'd be willing to trade my share of the mine right now for a few hand grenades.
You'd better get to your posts.
They're beating it.
- What do you make of that?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
Wait a minute, this may be some trick to lure us out.
I don't think so. They ain't good enough actors for this kind of a trick.
Hey, partner. Up here.
Here's a sight if there ever was one.
Federales. Look at them.
I could kiss every one of them.
They must've gotten it from the villagers there were bandits headed here.
Why don't they wait here, make a fight of it?
They know all the tricks, that's why.
With us behind and the federales facing them, they wouldn't have a chance.
Go get them, sic 'em time.
Chew them up and don't spit them out.
Swallow them.
Am I happy.
Tell you the truth,
I was already eating dirt.
I wonder who he is.
And if he's got any folks.
Supposing he has?
Let's take a look at his belongings.
A few hundred pesos.
Name's James Cody. Dallas, Texas.
A letter from Dallas, too.
It must be his home.
Reckon she's his girl.
Not bad.
"Dear Jim: Your letter just arrived.
"It was such a relief to get word after so many months of...
"silence.
"I realize, of course, that...
"there aren't any mailboxes that you can drop a letter in...
"out there in the wild."
You better read it.
"But that doesn't keep me from worrying about you.
"Little Jimmy is fine, but he misses his daddy almost as much as I do.
"He keeps asking,
'When's Daddy coming home? '
"You say if you do not make a real find this time...
"you'll never go again.
"I cannot begin to tell you how my heart rejoices...
"at those words, if you really mean them.
"Now I feel free to tell you...
"I've never thought any material treasure...
"no matter how great, is worth the pain of these long separations.
"The country is especially lovely this year.
"It's been a perfect spring.
Warm rains and hardly any frost.
"The fruit trees are all in bloom.
"The upper orchard looks aflame...
"and the lower, like after a snowstorm.
"Everybody looks forward to big crops.
"I do hope you are back for the harvest.
"Of course, I'm hoping that you will at last strike it rich.
"It is high time for luck...
"to start smiling upon you.
"But just in case she doesn't...
"remember we've already found life's real treasure.
"Forever yours, Helen."
I guess we better dig a hole for him.
Yeah, not so good.
Not so good as yesterday.
Want my opinion?
It'll be a lot less from now on.
We've taken all the gold this mountain has.
How much do you figure we got to date?
Not as much as we were aiming to collect.
Not $40,000.
I'm willing to lower my hindsight.
We've got upwards of $35,000 apiece.
I tell you, we ought to be plenty thankful.
Let's call it quits and pack up and leave.
The sooner the better as far as I'm concerned.
I don't want to keep that dame waiting.
It'll take a week to break the mine, put the mountain back in shape.
Do what to the mountain?
Make her look like she was before we came.
I don't get it.
We wounded this place.
It's our duty to close her wounds.
The least we can do to show our gratitude for all the wealth she's given us.
If you guys don't want to help me,
I'll do it alone.
You talk about that mountain like it was a real woman.
She's been a lot better to me than any woman I ever knew.
Keep your shirt on, old-timer.
Sure, I'll help you.
I reckon that's about everything.
Each man's burros with his goods will be his own responsibility.
Come on.
Goodbye, mountain, and thanks.
Yeah, thanks, mountain.
I've been thinking about her.
Cody's widow, I mean, and the kid.
You know what?
We ought to give them a fourth just as if he'd been our partner from the start.
What? A fourth of all our goods?
- That's right.
- Are you crazy?
If not for him, we wouldn't have walked away from that mountain.
Ask Howard.
The buzzard would have gotten fat on us all right.
Yeah, it might just as well have been one of us.
But it wasn't.
It's our good luck and his bad.
Whatever you guys do,
I'm going to give a fourth.
I got more than I need, anyhow.
Half what I got is enough to last me out.
Fourth? Sure.
You two guys must have been born in a revival meeting.
We got company.
Steady, boys.
Coffee.
Give him some tobacco.
We give them our tobacco, they give us theirs, I don't get it.
Why not everybody smoke his own?
Take some and thank them.
They're after something.
Takes them a while to come to the point.
To say what you want right off the bat isn't considered polite among Indians.
They got nothing but time?
His boy fell in the water, they fished him out.
- He ain't dead, but he just won't come to.
- Tough.
I'll go have a look at the boy.
I'll be back in a little while.
Before morning, probably.
Look after my goods while I am gone.
Tequila.
Artificial respiration did it and a few Boy Scout tricks.
I think it was more shock than drowning.
He hadn't swallowed much water.
Maybe he was stunned while diving.
How did these Indians know we were in this neck of the woods anyhow?
When you're near their villages, don't ask me how, they just know.
What's up?
He's insisting we return to his village and be his guests.
Tell him to forget it.
Tell him he don't owe us a thing.
If he doesn't pay off his debt all the saints will be angry.
This is no laughing matter.
I'm afraid he's determined to take us with him, even if it means force.
I'll handle this.
Wait a minute. You can't fight your way out of this. Put your guns away.
Have every Indian in the mountain on our trail. We'd be scalped in half an hour.
What'd he say then?
It didn't make any difference about you guys but I have to come.
- It's like that, he just wants you.
- Looks like it.
Why don't you go with them?
Stay a few days and we'll meet you in Durango. We'll wait there.
- What about my goods?
- Why don't you take them with you.
If they found out they might forget he was their honored guest and bump him off.
What'll I do? Dump them on the ground?
We'll take them with us if you want us to and wait for you in Durango.
I reckon that's about the only solution.
I bet you'll remember this the next time you try to do a good deed.
Maybe after I've stayed with them they'll give me a horse.
Then I'll be a day or two behind you.
That'll be swell. Good luck, Howard.
Yeah, all the luck in the world.
We'll be lonesome without you. But my Sunday school teacher used to say:
"You got to learn to swallow disappointments in this sad life."
Hurry up and join us.
Look out for those Indian dames.
They tell me they're smart.
One of them squaws might marry you.
Maybe I'll do just that. Pick out a good-looking squaw and marry her.
They're easy to dress, feed and entertain.
They don't nag at you, either.
So long, partners.
See you in Durango.
Ain't it always his burros that won't march in line... stray off the trail and smash their packs against the trees and rocks?
I wish they'd stray off far enough to fall down about 2,000 feet of gorge.
Why'd you offer to carry his goods for him?
As if he couldn't manage by himself.
He knew what he was doing when he turned them over to us.
Mighty cute of him, wasn't it?
What's the use of railing against the old man? It won't do any good.
Save your breath for the next piece of trail.
I'm stopping here for the night.
If you want to go on it's okay with me, but take his burros with you.
They ain't my responsibility.
It's early. We can make four, five miles more before dark.
Nobody ordered you to stay here.
You can go 20 miles more for all I care.
Ordered me?
You?
Who's ordering who to do anything?
You talk like you're boss of this outfit.
Maybe you are, let's hear you say it.
All right, if you can't go any further.
Who says I can't? Don't make me laugh.
I can go four times as far as a mug like you.
But I don't want to. I could if I want to, but I don't want to, see, mug?
What's the use of hollering?
We're started on something and we've got to finish it, like it or not.
We'll camp here.
Wonder what the old man's doing now.
Eating a meal of roast turkey and drinking a bottle of tequila probably.
This is the first day we've had to manage without his help.
Once we get the hang of it, it'll be easier.
How far away do you suppose the railroad is?
- Not so far as the crow flies.
- We ain't crows.
I figure we can reach the high-pass in two days more... then it'll be three or four days to the railroad.
That's figuring no hard luck on the trail, of course.
What's the joke, Dobbsie?
Aren't you going to let me in on it?
In on it? Sure I will.
Sure.
Go ahead, spill it. What's so funny?
I was thinking what a bonehead play that old jackass made...
- when he put all his goods in our keeping.
- What do you mean?
Figured he'd let us do his sweating for him, did he?
- We'll show him.
- What are you getting at?
Can't you see? It's all ours.
We don't go back to Durango at all.
Not at all.
I don't follow you.
Don't be such a sap.
Where did you ever grow up?
All right, to make it clear to a dumbhead like you... we take all his goods and go straight up north and leave the jackass flat.
You aren't serious, are you? You don't really mean what you are saying.
Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing he don't mean.
As long as I'm here and can do anything, you won't touch the old man's goods.
I know exactly what you mean.
You want to take it all for yourself and cut me out.
No, I'm on the level with the old man, like I'd be with you if you weren't here.
Get off your soapbox. You only sound foolish out here in this wilderness.
I know you for what you are.
For a long time I've had my suspicions about you and now I know I've been right.
- What suspicions?
- You're not putting anything over on me.
I see right through you.
For a long time you've wanted to bump me off at the first opportunity... and bury me out here in the bush like a dog... so you could take not only the old man's goods but mine in the bargain.
When you get to Durango safely you'll have a big laugh... thinking how dumb the old man and I were.
You make another move towards me and I'll pull the trigger.
Now, get your hands up.
Come on, get them up.
Was I right, or was I?
You and your Sunday school talk about protecting people's goods.
You. Go on, stand up, and take it like a man.
Come on, get up.
Let go of it.
- The cards are dealt the other way now.
- Yeah.
Now listen to me...
Look, you're all wrong.
Not for a moment did I ever intend to rob you or do you any harm.
Just like I said...
I'd fight for you and yours like I'd fight for the old man's.
If you really mean that give me back my gun.
My pal.
Wouldn't it be better the way things are to separate tomorrow or even tonight?
- That would suit you fine, wouldn't it?
- Why me more than you?
So you could fall on me from behind, sneak up and shoot me in the back.
All right, I'll go first.
And wait for me on the trail to ambush me?
Why wouldn't I do it now if I meant to kill you?
I'll tell you why, because you're yellow.
You don't have the nerve to pull the trigger while I'm looking you in the eye.
If you think like that, there's nothing to do but to tie you up every night.
I'll tell you what. I'll make you a little bet.
Three times 35 is 105.
I'll bet $105,000 you go to sleep before I do.
Get up there at the head of the train.
Get up!
The cards are dealt the other way now, and for the last time. No more shuffling.
- What cards are...
- I'm going to finish this right now.
I won't take orders from you like I had to do today.
- You mean you're going to murder me?
- No, brother, not murder. Your mistake.
I'm doing it to save my life that you'd take from me when I wasn't looking at you.
- The old man'll catch up with you.
- He will, will he?
I got an answer for that one, too.
Know what I'll tell him?
I'll tell him you tied me to a tree and made your getaway taking all our goods.
He'll be looking for you and not me.
Up. March. Today I had to march to your music, now you march to mine.
- Where?
- To your funeral.
Come on, keep going.
Get up. Sleepy?
You'll be asleep soon enough.
Sound asleep.
Maybe I didn't kill him.
Maybe he just staggered and fell down without being hit.
You keep it, it's yours anyhow.
No, they won't find him.
I'll dig a hole for him first thing in the morning.
This fire... don't give much heat.
Conscience.
What a thing.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it'll pester you to death.
But if you don't believe you've got one... what can it do to you?
Makes me sick all this talking and fussing about nonsense.
Maybe I'd better leave him like he is.
Ain't very likely anybody will find him.
In a week, the buzzards and the ants will have done away with him anyway.
I don't know what's getting into me.
Was that really a tiger?
No.
What if his eyes are open, looking at me?
Best thing to do is to get to the railroad in a hurry.
Burro.
It's better not to have buried him.
I did right, yeah.
What I should have done, maybe, was bury his clothes... and leave him to the ants and the buzzards.
Buzzards!
If somebody saw them circling, they'd know something was dead.
Buzzards ain't spotted him yet.
Lucky for me.
Curtin!
Where are you?
I better get a hold of myself.
I mustn't lose my head.
There's one thing certain, he ain't here.
I got it. The tiger.
Yeah, that's it. The tiger must have dragged him off to his lair, that's what.
Yeah, pretty soon, not even the bones will be left to tell the story.
Done as if by order.
I came to in the middle of the night.
My gun was on the ground beside me.
He must have left it there to make it look like suicide.
I figured he'd come back in the morning to see if I still had a flicker of life.
I thought about waiting for him and letting him have it... but there was a good chance in my condition I might miss... so I decided to crawl away like a poisoned dog.
- Take it easy, you're talking too much.
- Don't you worry about me.
I'll pull out of this if only to get that guy.
It appears our fine Mr. Dobbs has made off with our goods and is on his way north.
- Yeah.
- I reckon we can't blame him too much.
What do you mean?
I mean, he's not a real killer, as killers go.
I think he's as honest as the next fella, or almost.
The mistake was leaving you two in the depths of the wilderness... with more than $100,000 between you.
That's a big temptation, partner, believe me.
He shot me down in cold blood.
After I was down he shot me a second time just to make sure.
If I was young and out there with one of you, I'd have been tempted, too.
Maybe I wouldn't have fallen, but I reckon I would've been tempted.
There now. You're almost as good as new.
Now, to find that thief and get our goods back.
They're not only giving me a horse but coming to protect me.
- You ain't going.
- Who says so?
You wouldn't be up to the hard riding.
- You aren't leaving me behind.
- Look at you.
You're weak as a kitten.
Don't worry, I'll look after our interests.
I'm going.
Well, I reckon you're going.
Burro!
Have you got any cigarettes?
No, I haven't. I've got a little tobacco... if that'll do.
No paper to roll it in?
Papers?
Here you are.
- Going to Durango?
- Yeah.
That's where I'm headed.
I've got to sell my burros.
I got to get some money.
I haven't got a red cent.
Matches?
Money? We need money, too.
Yeah? I could use a good mule driver... maybe two or three.
How much is the pay?
Two pesos.
Of course, I can't pay you in advance...
I got to wait till I get to town so I can get the money.
Do I know you from someplace?
Maybe I know you.
No, I don't think so.
- Are you alone?
- No.
I'm not alone.
I got a couple of friends coming along on horseback.
Yeah, they ought to be here any minute.
That's funny.
A man all by himself in bandit country with a string of burros... and his friends behind him on horseback.
Your friends must be very far behind you.
Pablo cannot see any dust even from their horses.
They'll be along any minute, I tell you.
I know who you are.
You're the guy in the hole.
The one who wouldn't give us the rifle.
I never laid eyes on you until now.
What you got in the bags?
- Seems to me like hides.
- Yeah.
That's what they are, hides.
Ought to bring in quite a lot of money.
Yeah.
Sure you don't want to come along with me and help me with the burros?
Burro.
Get away from my burro.
We can sell those burros for just as good a price as you'd get.
Get away from my burro.
You can't frighten even a sick louse with that. You can only shoot one of us... and he wouldn't mind too much.
The federales are after him anyway.
So what with your gun?
- We'll take that chance.
- Get back there.
- Shooting.
- Volley. Execution, probably.
- Dobbs is dead.
- What?
- Bandits got him.
- Our goods. What about our goods?
- What?
- He says our goods are safe in his office.
- It's not here, Howard.
- Keep your shirt on.
What?
He heard the bandits talking while they were waiting to be shot.
They thought it was bags of sand hidden among the hide... to make it weigh more when Dobbs went to sell them.
Where are they?
They're in the ruins outside town.
Come on!
Looks like a norther.
Laugh, Curtin, old boy, it's a great joke played on us... by the Lord, or fate, or nature, whatever you prefer... but whoever or whatever played it certainly had a sense of humor!
The gold has gone back to where we found it!
This is worth ten months of suffering and labor, this joke is!
Well, Howard, what next I wonder?
I'm all fixed as far as I'm concerned as a medicine man.
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want... roof over my head, and a drink now and then to warm me up.
I will be worshipped, fed, and treated like a high priest... for telling people what they want to hear.
Good medicine men are born, not made.
Come and see me sometime, my boy.
Even you'll take off your hat when you see how respected I am.
The day before yesterday, they wanted to make me their legislature.
Their whole legislature!
I don't know what that means. I think it's the highest honor they can bestow.
Yeah, I'm all fixed for the rest of my natural life.
How about yourself?
What do you aim to do?
I haven't got any idea.
You're young. You've got plenty of time to make three or four fortunes.
You know, the worst ain't so bad when it finally happens.
Not half as bad as you figure it'll be before it happens.
I'm no worse off than I was in Tampico.
All I'm out is $200 when you come right down to it.
Not very much compared to what Dobbsie lost.
Any special place you're bent on going?
No, all places are the same to me.
You can keep my share of what the burros and the hides'll bring... if you use it to buy a ticket to Dallas.
See Cody's widow. Better than writing.
And besides, it's July and the fruit harvest.
How about it?
It's a deal.
Well, let's get going.
- Goodbye, Curtin.
- Goodbye, Howard.
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
Today, Sunday July 26th 1942, is a peaceful, lazy day of rest here on our transport somewhere in the South Pacific.
And very pleasant it is too, here in the beautiful white sunshine of the port deck with the blue panel of the sea to watch and a good song rising clear.
Where Father Donnelly, Notre Dame 1917, all-American fullback for two years, now simply Chaplain Donnelly, is working the second shift.
Say, Sammy, your voice is OK.
Why not? My father was a cantor in the synagogue.
We"re on the signal bridge, where
Colonel Grayson and his staff are relaxing, as contented as if seated on their front porches of a Sunday morning back home.
What a way to travel to war. l wish we had the funnies.
So we could see if Mammy Yokum got the termites out of the turnip patch.
However the favourite occupation, as usual, is shooting the breeze.

Boy, l"d sure like to be back home, sailing me a boat on Chesapeake Bay. lf l was back home l wouldn"t be on no boat. lf l was back in Laredo l"d go and see my Conchita.
- Maybe Lolita.
- Well, make up your mind.
All right, Conchita.
And Lolita.
Ebbets Field, that"s for me.
Watching them beautiful Bums.
Bums is right.
- Just leading the league.
- Oh, sure. That league.
Got any dough which says the Yanks will take us in the Series?
The Dodgers ain"t even in it yet.
What good"ll dough do where you"re going?
- How do you know where we"re going?
- Oh, pipe down.
Besides, l don"t care if l never see any more dough again.
Of course, you monkeys understand l"m talking about Confederate dough.
Say, ain"t you a war correspondent?
- That"s right.
- Put my name in the paper.
The funny paper.
- Sure. What is it?
- Johnny Anderson.
You can call him Chicken.
He"s just sprouting his pinfeathers.
A certain party l know will get a kick out of that.
You know your mother don"t let you go out with no dames.
Pipe down, will you? l got him.
(PA) Sweepers, man your brooms.
Clean sweep-down fore and aft.
Pleasant too to stretch out in the calm tropical night with the lapping of the waves beating a soft, faint obbligato to our song.
They"re a great bunch of kids, Father.
- They"ll do all right.
- Mm-hm.
Any news yet as to where we"re headed?
Even the colonel doesn"t know that.
So then l says ""Listen, do you think what l"m thinking?""
She gives me one of them looks and says ""Yeah.""
That"s a tomato every time.
- Writing to that babe of yours?
- Why not?
- Some doll, huh?
- Yeah, she"s a real hunk of woman.
- And she don"t give me no arguments either.
- She don"t, huh?
You know, l had me a dame like that once.
But so did a lot of other guys.
- Good night, Chicken.
- Good night, Taxi.
OK, boys.
Come on, come on.
Cut out the skylarking. Hit the sack.
Lights out, one minute.
Hey, Sergeant.
Do you know yet what we"re up to?
Oh, the same old thing - manoeuvres.
Don"t say l told you.
Up and down landing nets, in and out of boats - l"m geting tired of this.
The way you looked at Onslow Beach you could stand plenty of practice.
One of these days we"re gonna run up against the real thing.
- Hey, Tex.
- Yeah.
- Hot, ain"t it?
- Yeah.
Hoter than a Texas catle car in August.
- So you think it"s hot, do you?
- Yeah.
How would you like a nice tall glass of ice-cold beer?
Beer. Strictly a middle-class beverage.
The last time l was in Brooklyn it was just such a night as this.
We was having cocktails.
The old lady brought them in, l took one taste, and boy, what a kick.
- You know what she did?
- What?
She took "em out and put in another slug of gin.
- What a sweet old lady.
- Yeah.
- Well, good night, Taxi.
- Good night.
Yes, this has been a peaceful, lazy day of rest almost everywhere on the ship.
Despite the fact that tomorrow or the next day we"ll know where we"re headed.
Where possibly we may be wounded or die on some Japanese beachhead.
- What"s going on?
- l don"t know.
- Where"d they come from?
- Look at "em. ls that a task force for ya!
How many are there?
Must be about a thousand.
- So we"re out on manoeuvres, eh?
- My eye. Looks like the real McCoy.
- Where"s Jordan? He"ll know the answer.
- Jordan, come here.
Give us the lowdown. What are they?
The Pepsi-Cola. The llluscious.
- Boy, that"s a heap of "em.
- Now if we only knew where we were going.
Looks like we mean business, Colonel. lt"s a cheerful thought to be going into this with all this power and force behind us.
- What"s this coming?
- That"s the FCPL.
They got a civilian with them.
How do you do, Mr Weatherby? l"m Colonel Grayson.
- Dispatches, sir.
- Well, now maybe we"ll find out something.
- Tokyo?
- Could be.
Gentlemen, we"re going to atack the Japanese strongholds on Guadalcanal and Tulagi in the Solomon lslands.
Guadalcanal?
The Navy and Coast Guard will put us ashore.
Once established, our objective is an airfield which the enemy has almost completed.
Mr Weatherby, who has supervised a copra plantation there, will tell you some of the difficulties you may expect to encounter.
Well, fellas, this is a detailed map of Guadalcanal.
After crossing the beach you"ll have to penetrate a field of grass from four to six feet high - and it"s good stuff for the Japs to hide in too.
""Headquarters, fifth regiment, first marine division, fleet marine force, 26th July 1942.""
""From Colonel Wallace E Grayson, USMC, to all members of this command.""
""Subject: mission of this force.""
""The coming action marks the first offensive involving ground forces of the US.""
- ""The marines are to initiate this action...""
- Ain"t it always the way?
""..which will prove the forerunner of successive offensive actions that will end in ultimate victory for our cause.""
And all we have to do to prove it is to get shot at.
- ""We have worked hard for this action...""
- He"s telling us.
""..and l have every confidence in our ability and desire to force our will upon the enemy.""
- He took the words right out of my mouth.
- ""We meet a tough and wily opponent.""
""But he is not sufficiently tough or wily to overcome us, because we are marines.""
- Now you"re talking.
- ""Each of us has a task.""
""Let each vow to perform it to the utmost of his ability, with added effort for good measure.""
""Good luck and God bless you.
God favours the bold and strong of heart.""
Wallace E Grayson.
- Very well done, Hook.
- Thank you, Brother Pots. lf l"d only gone to high school...
Hey, what is this?
""Annexe E to general order number 3, paragraph D.""
""Burial.""
""Graves will be suitably marked.
All bodies will wear identification tags.""
Most of you have never had any experience in the jungle before and the Japs have. Plenty.
So let me give you a word of advice: keep your mouths shut.
Stop yelling your head off.
We can beat "em at their own game of silence if we try, but... you know how marines are.
Some dope"ll yell ""Hey, mac. ls that C company over there?"" lt isn"t funny. Don"t laugh. lf any of you run over to see if C company is over there, what kind of chow C company"s having, you"re liable to end up chow yourself.
Honourable bullet, take honourable death of honourable Japanese.
Keep an eye out for snipers all the time.
See a bunch of bananas in a coconut tree, shoot "em down. That makes sense, don"t it?
Hey, wait a minute.
This ain"t government issue.
No, that"s Flatbush issue. lf it"ll make the Japs happy to die for their emperor, l"ll try to make "em happy.
Going to take the island all by yourself?
That would cause no surprise in certain circles in Brooklyn.
And one more thing.
Watch out for booby traps.
Don"t go round picking up anything the Japs leave laying around.
What if you promised a certain party a souvenir?
Just forget about it. You"re liable to find it"ll blow right up in your kisser. lf you see any .45 with a beautiful pearl handle, leave it lay.
- The most beautiful pearl in the world?
- Hiya, Father.
- How many Japs they got on that island?
- Hard to say. Several thousand.
- Any natives?
- About 16,000.
- Uh... cannibals?
- No, l believe they"re strict vegetarians.
But then of course they"ve never tasted marine meat.
Don"t worry. Perhaps we"ll land on Friday.
- Well, Chick, looks like it won"t be long now.
- Looks that way.
- Tomorrow morning maybe, eh?
- Maybe.
Hey, Taxi, what time is it back home now anyway?
- How many hours" difference is there?
- 19 between here and San Francisco.
And three more to home.
But l never can tell which way it is.
That"s the trouble with me too. l can never tell whether it"s yesterday or tomorrow.
- Would you like to hold him a while?
- Sure.
- Take it easy, boy. l"ll see you later, kid.
- Yeah, so long.
- Geting bald?
- lt"s beginning to look that way.
- How will Edith like that?
- She won"t.
By the way, if you need any hair restorer l have an ample supply. A going-away gift.
What do you suppose they"re doing about now?
Sleeping, l hope.
Quite a difference to the days when l sat in your class and listened to you propound the great philosophies of the world. l don"t know. Philosophy might come in pretty handy these days.
Jim. How do you feel?
Scared? l suppose so. l try to look at it as just ajob, like selling a big order when there"s sales resistance.
Funny that we two should end up like this.
The first two companies in.
- Three to one says my outfit lands first.
- Three coconuts to two says you don"t.
Good. lt"s odd we haven"t been atacked by a submarine. Surely they spoted us.
Yes, it is rather odd.
Couldn"t be a trap, could it?
By the way, we ought to be there by morning. l hear the zero hour should be about 6.20.
Approximately. l"d say the landing would be nearer 8.30.
- Beter not go ashore with the first wave.
- And why not?
That"s when l"ll be needed the most, isn"t it? l guess l"d beter look down below and see if anybody"s got the jiters.
And now at last the great day itself:
Friday August 7th, 1942.
The day for which we"ve trained so long.
The day of landing.
There"s none of the gaiety and song which filled the few preceding days.
Every nerve taut.
Perhaps this is because the thing that"s happening seems like a dream.
Here and there a man wets his lips.
Breathing is a little harder.
Waiting, eyes strained.
Field glasses pointing toward that high, irregular mass lying beyond the water.
Toward Guadalcanal.
Well, there she is.
We must have almost passed their bateries.
- Either it"s a trick or they"re awful dumb.
- lf it works out, it"ll make a swell story.
Let"s not think of it any other way. lt"s got to work.
- Well, Sarge, looks like this is it.
- Yeah.
Unbuckle your chin straps and your cartridge belts.
This ain"t no turkey shoot. Make "em all count.
Don"t worry, Sarge. l will.
- Well, Sarge, looks like this is it.
- Yeah.
- What they handing you?
- Something till they put up the galleys.
Biscuit, sugar, soluble coffee and meat and vegetable stew.
Sounds just like Thanksgiving, huh?
Thanksgiving!
Sorry we"re not going in the same boat.
No use puting all of our eggs in one basket.
Funny how we can stand here preparing to force a landing on the enemy shore and act as if it were the most normal thing in the world.
Yes, it is rather.
You know, Sarge, times like these make me wish l was back in Brooklyn.
Driving my cab and keeping an eye on them Bums.
When the Yanks get another crack at them they"ll take "em apart. l should live so long!
Hey, what am l saying?
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
Hey, look. Our planes.
Heads down below the gunwales.
That ought to knock out any machine-gun nests or any artillery emplacements.
Hit the deck.
Watch every tree.
- What"s up?
- l thought l saw a Jap in that tree.
You"re learning fast. Beter to waste ammunition than take any chances. l"m all wore out landing against such heavy fire.
- Don"t worry. We"ll hear from them yet.
- So far so good. l hope it isn"t a trap.
The second wave"s coming in.
Captain Davis.
- Captain Davis!
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Any sign of the enemy?
- l think they"re hiding in the hills.
Push right on, but be careful.
- How about those coconuts you owe me?
- l thought it was a photo finish.
- You moving up?
- No.
Colonel Grayson wants me to hold this village until the MPs move in.
- They sure must have left here in a hurry.
- Yeah.
Wasteful, l calls it.
- Hook, there"s somebody in there.
- Where?
Watch out, kid.
Ah, for the love of...
Give me a cigarete.
- Since when did you start smoking?
- l"m starting right now.
Come on.
Easy through the door, fellas. That"s it.
- Hey, what are you going to do with that?
- Sleep in it, l hope.
Just what l needed for Saturday night.
- l wonder what the Japs use it for?
- l wouldn"t know. l got me a case of Jap beer.
Hey, Bowman.
Caviar. l thought these monkeys lived on fish heads and rice.
Yes. lt"s hardly the primitive diet on which they"re supposed to subsist.
- Tastes good too.
- Provided, of course, it isn"t poisoned. lf nothing happens to you, let me know.
Gangway!
- Gangway!
- Padre, where"d you get the bike?
- Hey, where did you get it?
- Plenty more where this came from.
Must be a couple of hundred Jap trucks there.
No telling how many radios, guns. l guess we really caught them with their pants down.
That"s one way of puting it.
But from the reports from Tulagi, l"m not so sure they did over there.
Where"s me helmet?
Hey, Hook. This is it.
- lt"s only three monkeys on a rope.
- Pretty small, eh?
Ugly, ain"t they?
Hey, Snow White, where"s the rest of the Seven Dwarves?
- Hart, Schaffner and Marx.
- (laughter)
We found them under a bush.
We thought it was a trap and let them have it.
A couple of them got away.
- Are these the monkeys we"re fighting?
- No, these are labourers.
We can"t get much out of them, sir.
This lingo they talk.
They keep pointing to the hills. l guess that"s where the rest of them went.
- Are they praying?
- They think we"re going to shoot them.
Corpsman.
Fix "em up.
Arigato.
We ain"t got no avocados.
Let"s get going.
Turn these prisoners over to the MP.
There"s the airfield.
They appear to have moved out, so we"ll move in.
Pots, Anderson.
This flag belonged to Lieutenant Snall.
He carried it all the way through China.
He"s had a heart atack. lt"s his ambition to see his flag flying over captured territory.
- Run it up.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Maybe we should have waited.
Let the Japs finish it up.
Ahh, l bet there ain"t a Jap within ten miles of here.
Hit the deck.
Where"s me helmet?
Corpsman.
Corpsman.
- ls he dead?
- Yeah, he"s dead.
Amen.
May God have mercy on his soul.
Yes, he is dead. And now we know that not all the enemy have fled.
That in the jungle surrounding us men are lurking.
Silent, dangerous, with weapons.
How many? Where are they hiding?
How grave is the danger?
No man can say.
We"ll have to wait and watch in the rain.
Each man with his own thoughts, caught and held in the grip of unseen danger.
And into the night too, with only the drip of the rain through the palms and distant thunder of naval guns in our ears.
Knowing that if our people lose the battle, the enemy will be ashore before morning and we"ll have to fight for our lives.
Suddenly most of us know the awful feeling of being pitifully small.
Know for a moment that we"re only tiny particles caught up in the whirlpool of war, the terror and power and magnificence of man-made thunder making that point real.
And so, wet, miserable and sleepless, at the mercy of great forces more powerful than anything human, we face the first night of occupation.
- The Navy isn"t doing much sleeping either.
- Not from the sound of that firing.
- Suppose they"ll come in here and shell us?
- Could be.
Help! lt"s a Jap. He"s got me. Help!
Help!
- What is it?
- A Jap. l"m asleep there.
A Jap jumped out of a tree with a knife.
- Tojo himself.
- (babble of voices)
All right, pipe down. Shove off.
Honest, Sarge. l could have sworn l felt his buck teeth.
Here"s your first Jap prisoner.
Who"s there?
Who"s there?
Jap snipers?
What"s the mater out here? l heard something. l thought it was a Jap.
Knock off that shooting at every shadow.
These men are trying to get some sleep.
- Next time, go after him with your bayonet.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Right through the back.
Hiding up in the trees like apes...
Why don"t they come out in the open and fight?
There you are, Father. ln his pell-mell retreat, the enemy has not even destroyed his equipment.
Already we are converting it to our own use.
Constructing runways, erecting hangars, setting up defences against the day when we"ll have our own air support.
Knowing that until that day comes we"ve but one course to follow- to dig in and wait.
Come on, Taxi, step it up. Dig in, will you?
Maybe if we dig deep we"ll come up at Ebbets Field.
Sure. l"m practically standing on second base right now.
We lost four cruisers last night off Savo.
We beat them off, though, but good.
- And our casualties in Tulagi and Gavutu?
- Heavy. The Japs fought to the last man.
- How many did we get, sir?
- About 400 on Tulagi. 800 on Gavutu.
We took them by surprise.
Knocked them off like ducks.
Any way of geting our stories out?
There"s a navy plane scheduled in. l"ll see if l can get them aboard.
Thank you, sir.
The first hectic days are over, but we have not been idle.
Day and night our patrols have been out, pushing deeper and deeper into the jungle.
Catching occasional glimpses of the enemy.
Waiting, eager and expectant, for our first contact with the Jap.
The Japs have been parachuting them inside our lines.
They need supplies.
Bring these men into my camp.
Lieutenant, you can read this. What"s it say?
Listen to this.
""The enemy before your eyes is collapsing.""
Look, l"m collapsing.
Wait, listen. ""A relief landing party is near.""
- What did l tell you?
- Go ahead. l"m frightened.
""We are convinced of help from the imperial heaven.""
Only God"s children go to heaven.
Listen. ""Respect yourself. By no means run away from the encampment.""
(Japanese accent) lt make Tojo very unhappy.
""The enemy has suffered enormous losses.""
""All transports have been sunk and his choicest troops have been annihilated.""
- l guess we"re dead and we don"t know it.
- We must be. How about that, Padre? lf we are, at least we"re not in imperial heaven. lf we ain"t, it ain"t the cook"s fault.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir?
- Ask Captain Davis to come here.
- He"s in the sickbay. A touch of cat fever.
Anything l can do?
These natives tell me there"s a big bunch of Japs at a village five miles from here.
The prisoner thinks they"ll surrender.
Seems they haven"t any food and most are without weapons.
Take a patrol and see what it"s all about.
- But don"t take any chances.
- Yes, sir. lt"ll be a pleasure. l suggest you go by boat and stay far enough off so they can"t snipe at you from shore.
- Malone.
- Yes, sir.
Take this fella down to sickbay and get him fixed up. He"s a friend of ours.
The hair on them guys!
What a spot for a matress factory.
Captain Cross, can l go with you? l know the woods pretty good.
- Sure. l"m glad to have you, Alvarez.
- Thank you, sir.
Aren"t you the lucky stiff?
Lying here with a pretty nurse waiting on you while l"m off hunting Japs. lf there"s any hunting of Japs to be done, l"m going to be in on it.
No, you go right ahead and goldbrick. l"ll do your dirty work for you.
Our first crack at the enemy.
Not just hiding in foxholes as he flies over, taking cover every five minutes, shaking our fists at something we can"t even see.
At Matanikau there are Japs.
Men of flesh and blood like ourselves.
We will see them face to face.
And as Captain Cross has put it, it"ll be a pleasure.
Hey, Captain, look.
He"s moving away from us.
He"s spoted us. He"s turning this way.
- Let"s turn back.
- No, he"ll head us off.
- We can"t make it.
- Coxswain, make a run for it.
Get your heads down.
- We may have to swim for it.
- Well, boys, it"s been a great life. lf you want my opinion, it"s ending a litle too soon.
Go alongside.
Those are our shore bateries.
They"re on the target.
Certain that the sounds of firing have revealed our presence,
Captain Cross has decided to wait for cover of darkness before landing near Matanikau despite the insistence of the Jap prisoner that all will be well, that his friends, starving and without weapons, are waiting in the village eager to surrender.
Turn back. We"ll make our way back by land.
All right, men, dig in. Right on the beach.
- What are we digging in here for, Captain?
- l"m not taking any chances.
Let"s have a look around.
We got to get back to the beach.
- Can you make it?
- Sure.
Hey, Corporal. There comes Captain Cross.
Cease firing.
Captain, what happened to Lieutenant Thurmond? l don"t know.
Soose, go in and see if you can find him.
Aye-aye, sir. l found Lieutenant Thurmond dead, sir.
We got to get word back to Colonel Grayson we"re in trouble.
- l want a volunteer.
- l"ll take a crack at it, sir.
- All right, son. Go ahead.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Slowly the night is dragged through.
Somehow our men, even the wounded, have managed to fight on against an unseen enemy whose perfidy and deceit are now all too clear, hoping against hope that help would come.
But with the rising sun the last hope fades.
Three men out of the entire patrol remain alive.
The others, to many of whom Guadalcanal was not even a name a few short months ago, now lie dead in their shallow foxholes, over which an indifferent sea is already beginning to roll.
We"d beter make a try for the palms.
OK, Captain.
We"d beter go back to Matanikau.
This time we"ll go in force. And for blood.
Yes, we"re going back to Matanikau.
And this time for blood.
Men, boys, going into battle for the first time in their lives.
Untried, new to the jungle.
High-school athletes, grocers, clerks, taxi drivers.
Men with memories of friends ambushed, tricked, slaughtered.
Those bayonets. l saw them. l saw them.
Soose, they never knew it.
Beter get that bar off your collar.
Don"t want to go round inviting trouble.
Thanks, Captain.
- How you doing? Still trigger-happy?
- You"d beter wait and ask the Japs.
Here.
- There you are.
- Thanks.
- Hey, Butch, you got a cigarete?
- Sure. Help yourself.
- Jap cigaretes.
- Half tobacco, half stinkweed.
Now l"ll enjoy them more than ever. l thought they were all stinkweed. Ew!
That"s one for Captain Cross.
Dig in light for a mortar barrage in this area.
Colonel Grayson says to watch your fire.
Only fire toward the beach.
Some of our men are moving in below.
Pass the word along. They"re not to fire into the palm grove. Only toward the beach.
OK.
Pass the word.
Keep your heads down.
- Hey, Hook.
- Yeah.
How do you feel about killing... people? lt"s kill or be killed, ain"t it?
Besides, those ain"t people.
- Yeah, l know, but the first time?
- Well, it was kind of rugged l guess.
Then it"s just repetition.
Quit thinking about it. You"ll go crazy.
Hey, look.
- That"s for me.
- Wait. You nuts?
All we ever shoot at is privates.
That"s a major.
You got enough to think about without going for souvenirs. And keep your head down.
Stay here.
- Yeah, Tex?
- You see what l see?
Oh, yeah.
- Are you Sergeant York or Gary Cooper?
- They were good too.
Scratch one squint-eye.
Hook.
- Hook.
- What the...?
- Hook.
- Yeah, take it easy.
Corpsman.
Corpsman! l thought he was dead.
Yeah, l know.
- Hook, am l going to...?
- Nah. You"ll be all right.
Beautiful sword. l promised a certain party...
Yeah, l know. lt ain"t possible.
We gota get outa here.
Think you can walk? l guess so.
Hold it. l"ll lift you up.
OK.
- Hook. The sword.
- Yeah, l know. You promised it.
Look, l"ll go back and get the sword for you.
You will? Thanks. l"ll get you a couple of Japs to put on it too.
- There"s an ambulance. Can you make it?
- Yeah.
- Hook, what time is it?
- Told you to save your breath. l mean, back home. l never thought this would happen to me.
What time is it, Hook?
Where"s the doctor? Doctor!
Yes.
Corpsman, plasma.
- You"d beter get back. l"ll watch out for him.
- Thanks, Father.
The Battle of Matanikau is over.
And this war of mighty armies, of masses of men, of tank and plane and armour, has been just an episode, a skirmish.
A few score men killed or wounded.
But the enemy has been defeated, almost wiped out, and one thing we"ve learned.
Colonel Grayson was right- it"s not going to be a picnic.
The first emotion, elation, is gone.
Veterans now, blooded bush-fighting specialists, their bravado gone, or at least subdued, with a new respect for the Japs.
Weary, silent, stunned.
Men with glazed eyes holding their sides.
Limping along, shock-blast victims, staggering, sometimes falling, the only sound an occasional groan.
Moving like drunken men or men in a dream.
Heads, legs bandaged, clothes torn.
Unlit cigarettes dangling from their lips.
Old before their times.
Boys with the memory of death in their eyes.
Staring, remembering friends they"ve left back there.
- You know what them monkeys say?
- Nah.
They didn"t even know they was on Guadalcanal.
As for them killing themselves rather than get caught, l saw a couple of these skivvies making a motion to commit hari-kari.
Did they break out in grins when nobody tossed them a knife.
- l ain"t got no use for this one.
- Mail.
- Mail.
- Mail.
Yahoo! Mail.
Come and get it.
- Dubosky.
- Here.
- Jensen.
- Coming up.
- Malone.
- That"s me.
Gimme that, will you?
Captain Cross.
- l"ll take it.
- Here"s two more, sir.
- Father Donnelly.
- Here.
- Bibles.
- lt"s heavier than that. More like a cake.
- Harold Grayson.
- How about Aloysius T Pots?
Take it easy. We"ll get around to you.
Mcllvoy.
Mcllvoy.
Oh, that"s me.
""Querido Jesus.""
""Aquí tengo tu retrato cerca...""
Conchita or Lolita?
Margarita.
From the Flatbush Athletic Club.
""Are you keeping fit in these difficult days?
You owe it to yourself to exercise regularly.""
""Course in body-building, $25.""
- lt"ll be a bargain.
- Yeah.
Yeah, l know. She"s some hunk of woman.
And she don"t give you no arguments either.
Hey, fellas, l"m a mother. Her name is Geraldine. She"s three months old.
He got up too soon.
Now, boys, l want you to study these. Diligently.
Thank you, Father.
Now maybe we can find out how we"re doing.
From dear Mom - and no bills. l wonder if Edith knows yet.
- What"s that?
- My future publisher. Book Of The Month.
- What have you got?
- Long Remember.
- What"s it about?
- The Batle of Gettysburg.
- You know. Gettysburg Address.
- Gettysburg Address?
Where Lincoln lived. Civil War, remember?
You mean the war they had in Gone With The Wind. Boy, that was a war.
That"s all.
Oop, one more.
- Dubosky.
- Hey, that"s another one for me.
Are you sure there"s nothing for me?
Sammy Klein?
Sorry, Sammy, that"s all there is.
They wrote to you. ltjust missed the boat.
You know how mail is.
Let"s go, mac.
Hey, Sammy.
Come here. l want you to read this.
""From the future Mrs Malone.""
She must be some dame if you want to marry her.
The trouble with you guys is you never met a lady. Go on, read it.
What makes you think l can read?
- Taxi, how"s about lending me that razor?
- What for? l must have lost mine coming ashore.
Let me see.
Right there.
Oh, yeah.
- Hey, Tex, Soose, fellas.
- Cut it out, Taxi.
We got to investigate this. Come over here.
- Look, a whisker.
- Where?
Right there.
You can see it with the naked eye.
- Think we ought to shave it off?
- Let"s leave it and see what it turns into.
- Kind of cute, ain"t it?
- Ow!
- Say, Hook.
- Yeah.
- Look what l found. Limes.
- Oh, boy. lf l only had some ice, soda water, cherries and a botle of gin, would l make you a Tom Collins.
- You know l"m just fooling, Father.
- That"s all right, son.
But if you find those ingredients, drop around.
Condition red.
Here we go again.
Condition red.
- Condition red.
- Sui.
Douse the fire.
- Where"s me helmet?
- Sui.
Here, boy. Here, Sui. Come on, boy.
- There they are.
- (anti-aircraft fire)
Here they come.
- Hit the deck.
- (bombs dropping)
Father Donnelly.
- He"s been hit.
- You"ll be all right. lt"s concussion.
Don"t burrow in so deep.
Next time, cushion yourself on your elbows.
Wait till our planes get here.
They won"t look so pretty.
Yeah, but where are our planes?
Today is a red-letter day on the island.
Reinforcements are coming in.
The army. And coming not a day too soon either, for we are tired after days of heat and rain, dust and disease, mud and malnutrition.
Weeks of constant fighting, watching the enemy slipping more and more men ashore from Bougainville and Rabaul.
The target of his bombers and Zeros, against whom we"re lucky to put up a mere six or seven Grummans. ls it any wonder the welcome sign is out? l never thought l"d be so glad to see an army man. My name"s Anderson.
Boy, am l glad to see you guys.
You"re a sight for sore eyes.
Say, buddy, how many Japs you killed?
Quiet. Confidentially, that"s a military secret.
Thought you"d be in foxholes on the beach.
This place looks great. lt does, huh? Well, give it time, brother.
The beauty will wear off.
- Where you from?
- Minnesota.
- l"m from Flatbush.
- Never heard of it.
What am l laughing at?
Every enemy thrust on our airfield so far has been beaten off.
His ships have been sunk, his dead are numbered in hundreds.
But the Jap is a persistent foe.
Now he is holed up in the caves on the island, from which vantage spots he is a constant menace to our patrols.
He must be driven out, and to Colonel
Grayson and his men has fallen the task.
Nor is it going to be an easy one.
These rocky ledges and great natural caves afford excellent positions, from which his machine guns can sweep the countryside.
The men behind those machine guns are fanatics.
They"ll die at their posts, some chained to their weapons, rather than surrender.
One by one they must be blasted from the earth that hides them.
- What do you think, Hook?
- l think it"s a trick.
There are probably 30 or 40 in each cave.
We"ve got to get them out of there.
- Malone, you and Pots know the ropes.
- l knew it.
Get above those caves and use grenades.
We"ll cover you, OK?
- Yeah, sure.
- OK, mac.
Take some of those pineapples.
- All set, Sarge?
- Yeah.
Davis"s idea.
He says it"ll blow the place to pieces.
Let me have it.
This gasoline and TNT ought to do the trick.
And now for the world of sports.
All right, pipe down.
The Yanks"ll murder them guys.
- Aloysius T Pots talking for the Yanks?
- New York"s my hometown, ain"t it?
Since when did Flatbush become part of New York?
Who said anything about Flatbush being part of New York? lt"s just vicey-versey.
Sportsman"s Park at St Louis was packed with 34,255 wild-eyed fans as the Cards and the Yanks tangled in the second game of the World Series.
On the mound for the New York Yanks was Ernie Bonham.
Well, that setles it.
The Cards sent their 23-year-old rookie out in a surprise move to even the Series.
- Come on, you Redbirds.
- Give us the score, will you?
Dazzling fielding marked every inning, but it was not until the eighth, with the score tied one to one, that the fans got the real thrills.
Will you give us the score?
Jim Brown and Terry Moore proved to be easy outs, but Enos Slaughter caught one of Bonham"s fast ones and slammed a scorching liner to right field and slid into second base for a double.
- l knew he could do it.
- Think nothing of it.
Take it easy, Ernie boy.
Make every one count.
Roy Cullenbine, confused by the Redbirds earlier on, made a perfect throw to the bag.
Ataboy.
- But Phil Rizzuto let the ball slip through.
- Tag the bum out.
While he was trying to locate it,
Slaughter dashed safely for third.
- l was expecting that.
- He isn"t home yet.
Stan Musial worked Bonham for a 2-3 pitch.
And then, with the home crowd yelling for a hit, he...
- And the final score...
- You can"t do that. Give us the score.
Wait. Shh.
And that"s the way the game ended.
Condition red. Condition red.
Condition red. Condition red.
Condition red.
Don, condition red.
First time l"ve ever had a tree in bed with me. l don"t mind the one with my name on it. lt"s the ""To whom it may concern"" l don"t like.
They"re throwing everything at us but the kitchen stove.
That"s the stove now.
- Here, take a puff.
- No, thanks.
Sure makes you feel kind of naked.
Nothing between you and kingdom come except coconut logs. lt isn"t so much dying. lt"s having to sit here and take it.
Anybody who says he ain"t scared is a fool or a liar.
- ls there any room in here?
- Come on in.
Sit over here, Father.
- Those sound like eight-inch shells to me.
- Bigger than that, l imagine.
There"s a report of a couple of batleships and about eight cruisers off Savo lsland.
- How"s it going up there?
- OK.
You know, they"ve got some great navy doctors here.
When this started they were in the midst of an operation.
Had to go on or the kid would have died.
Think they ran off and left him?
Not those boys.
- How do you know, Padre? Were you there?
- Who, me? Well, naturally l had to stay.
- Hey, that was a bomb.
- Yes, their planes are busy too.
They"re pasting Henderson Field.
Father, you got any objections if l say what l"m thinking?
Go right ahead, son. Don"t mind me.
Well, l don"t know about these other guys, but me, well... l"m telling you, this thing is over my head. lt"s going to take somebody bigger than me to handle it. l ain"t much at this praying business.
My old lady always took care of that.
Yeah, my old lady was like that too. l don"t know as l mean that kind of praying.
The Lord"s Prayer and things like that. l know what you"re talking about, Taxi. l used to pray like that when l was a kid.
""Lord, give me this, give me that.
Please let the Yanks win."" l never been in a spot like this before in my life. l"m no hero. l"m just a guy. l come out here because somebody had to come. l don"t want no medals. l just want to get this thing over with. l"m just like everybody else, and l"m telling you l don"t like it.
Except l guess there"s nothing l can do about it. l can"t tell them bombs to hit somewhere else.
Like l said before, it"s up to somebody bigger than me, bigger than anybody.
What l mean is l... l guess it"s up to God.
And l"m not kidding when l say l sure hope he knows how l feel. l"m not going to say l"m sorry for everything l"ve done.
When you"re scared like this, the first thing you do is start trying to square things. lf l get out of this alive, l"ll probably go out and do the same things all over again.
The only thing l know is l didn"t ask to get in this spot.
And if we get it - and it sure looks that way now - then l only hope he figures we"ve done the best we could and lets it go at that.
Maybe this is a funny kind of praying to you guys, but it"s what l"m thinking and praying.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Seeing your friends hurt and killed is not a thing you can easily forget.
True, we have killed four, five, six or even ten for every man we"ve lost.
That"s statistics. But l find it very difficult to think of these boys as statistics.
They were just Joe and Jim,
Bill and Whiz and Alabam to us.
God rest their souls.
Here they come again.
Hey, wait a minute.
Those ain"t Japs. Those are ours.
That"s our air support.
Thank God. At last.
- Our planes, Taxi.
- Yeah, our planes.
But what"s this? More reinforcements?
More marines coming ashore?
Kids full of big talk, itching for a fight.
Just like us a few months ago.
Hey, they got one of them here too.
""USO headquarters. Big dance tonight.
All marine and navy personnel invited."" l get it, Spike. FHA project 782.
Hey, good-looking, how"s the female situation?
- The which?
- The love life, stupid.
What is this love life the gentleman"s talking about?
Never heard of it. Must be some strange custom they have back in the States.
You"re killing you, ain"t you?
Don"t look now, but a truck of gas just came on the field.
Maybe they can stop dishing it out with an eyedropper.
Perhaps we"ll get out of here by Christmas.
But which Christmas?
- What, no sheeps" tongues?
- No sheeps" tongues.
Hey, Taxi, now maybe we"ll get three meals a day.
Must be some mistake. This tastes OK. l don"t like it, boy. When these luxuries start coming it means us marines has got to go.
- Hot.
- Oh.
- What"s up?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
You can bet one thing.
We"re not geting all that stuff for nothing.
We"ve learned not to underestimate them.
We know now they won"t surrender.
We also know they aren"t supermen either.
We outshoot them, we outfight them and we usually outguess them. lt"s taken us a while to get rid of our cockiness, but l think we"re ready now.
Here"s the enemy, with strong points stretching all the way through here.
About 10,000, as near as we can determine.
They"ve been building up their forces.
The terrain"s in their favour.
There"s jungles and rivers and up here, caves, like those on Tulagi, in which they holed in in the first days of our invasion.
Don"t make the mistake of underrating them.
They"re good. But we"re beter.
So far we"ve been on the defensive.
We"ve done very well at
Matanikau, Tenaru and Bloody Ridge.
But our ultimate success requires that we extend the area we occupy.
To do this we have three jobs.
One: to eliminate the Japs already on the island.
Two: to wipe out their heavy artillery, which is a constant menace to our airfields.
Three: to establish new bases from which to carry the fight to other enemy strongholds.
This will require an all-out effort, and l can think of no beter date to begin it than tomorrow.
November 10th, the 167th anniversary of the Marine Corps.
Tomorrow, the battle.
But tonight, the last night for many of us perhaps, there are other things to think of, to do.
A song. One we used to sing of an evening back home -
Bill and Joe and the rest of the gang.
Home. Most of all, home.
Things that are never very far from our thoughts.
That a letter managed somehow to bring closer to us, even here.
Little things that may give us the courage to face that tomorrow.
These boys are perfectly wonderful.
Makes me proud to serve with them. lf the other millions they"re training at home are anything like these, then we have nothing to worry about.
Dear Mom. l"m fine and l hope you and Dad are not worrying, because everything"s OK - no kidding.
Well, girly, l bet you never expected to hear from me again.
But ha-ha! l fooled you.
Because when a gentleman like l tells a lady like you something, that"s something.
They say that if we clean them out this time they"ll take us out of here for a rest.
That means l might see you for Christmas after all.
And l mean see.
- All set, Malone?
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Tell the men to fall in.
- Aye-aye, sir.
All right, you guys. Fall in!
Come on. On the double.
Left face.
Forward march.
At last the great offensive is under way, an offensive this time in force.
This will not be the last fight for Guadalcanal, but it is the beginning of the end.
Of that there can be no doubt.
And how the picture has changed.
The difficult early days, the critical days, from August 7th when we landed through October 26th when reinforcements and supplies began to pile ashore, those grave days are past.
No longer are we to be content merely to hold what we have.
With the army at our side we are out to get the
Jap, to give him a dose of his own medicine.
To make Henderson Field, our first objective on the island, a real offensive base from which to strike closer and closer to the heart of the Japanese octopus.
The plan is very simple.
Three detachments - one by the shore road, one by boat and a third through the jungle.
Those who go by shore will fight a holding action.
Those who go by boat will land far to the west and attack the enemy in the rear.
The main action on the Jap positions will come from the jungle.
And what of the men who are now advancing?
Those sorely tried marines who fought so gallantly in the first days, and who are now proceeding to the grim business of taking the fight to the enemy.
The long-awaited day of all-out action is at hand.
Gone now is the loud surface toughness of last summer. ln its place is the cool, quiet fortitude that comes only with battle experience.
There is to be but one command.
Attack, attack and attack.
Ain"t that General Vandegrift with Colonel Grayson?
Yeah.
- Don"t he know it"s dangerous up here?
- Why don"t you go tell him?
Hey, Jap. You forgot something.
You forgot something. Funny.
That"s one you taught me, Tojo.
Today, December 10th 1942, will be our last day on the island.
The job is done. We are going out. lt"s from Admiral WF Halsey, commander of the South Pacific force. lt says: ""Never throughout the history of the Marine Corps have your deeds been surpassed.""
""Your courage and tenacity make for a fighting spirit that has surmounted every hardship and conquered a treacherous enemy.""
""No commander could ask more than you have given each hour of the day and night.""
""By your accomplishments you have added a new verse to the Marine Hymn, set the patern for our victory and tower as an inspiration for every American.""
""Today as never before we the Navy are justly proud of you.""
""ln deep appreciation for ajob superbly done, and knowing you will win until victory, we say "God bless you all."""
Yes, going out for a well-earned rest, the job superbly done.
The army is coming in to take over. lnto their hands we commit the job with full confidence in their ability to perform it.
Oh, boy. A whisker, finally.
- Hey, buddy, what"s it like out here?
- lt"s pretty rugged, son.
- See you guys in Tokyo.
- OK. We"ll be there waiting for you.

{y:i}Until 1941, it was known

{y:i}In June of that year,

{y:i}By the end of October, 1941,
{y:i}they had made progress.
{y:i}Six five-inch naval guns like these

{y:i}In addition, they had 12 mobile

{y:i}A squadron of 12 Grumann F4F3's,

{y:i}And the 385 officers and men

It cost me an awful lot of money.
I'll bet it did.
Practically all my savings.

Better catch up on your ice cream sodas.
Thanks, Daddy.
I'll be gone a long time.
Thanks a lot!
Well, what goes with thanks?
Where is this old
Wake Island, anyhow?
Oh, it's just a little strip of sand with a lot of water around it.
Good-byes are awful, aren't they?
Well, you let yourself in for a lot of them when you married a marine.
I know.
What, again?
I'd feel like this if you were going away overnight.

Oh. Morning.
I don't suppose you got a bar on this boat.
Can't even offer you a cold shower.
Have we got there yet?
No. We won't be in for some time.
Would you like to slick up a little?
Look, General, you're a soldier and I'm a civilian.
I got a government contract with a mighty important job to do, but there's not one word in it about takin' orders from brass hats.
That goes for suggestions about shavin' too.
Call me when we get there.
That's all I want from you.
Let me take another look at our future home.

I don't rate no fancy parade.
Well, if I'd thought of it,
I'd have had some of our boys lined up for you... with shovels.
How you been making out?
Oh, fair to middlin',
Mr. McCloskey.
Built quarters for the men and spotted some of the ground work.
Maybe not as much as you'd expect, but we've sorta been waitin' around for you.
I'll take a look at what you've done, then
I'd like to meet the crew and get acquainted.
All right.
And you've gotta get that excavating finished.
You better work three shifts.
I wanna start pouring concrete by Thursday.
Oh, that'll be tough.
Maybe so. Do it anyway.
I've never been late with a contract yet, not even a government one, and I'm not gonna start in on this bird sanctuary.

'Cause when he sounds off,
I'm gonna get up, beat his brains out, then go back to sleep.

I'm glad I don't have to take that guff from you much longer.
Seven more days, and all you'll see is my tail feathers.
I still got that 10 bucks, and it still says you don't leave.
Do you really wanna lose 10 bucks?
Put up or shut up.
Okay.
There.
It's a bet.
Wait a minute.
Where's your dough?
I got it, all right.
Don't worry.
Let me see it.
It's very dangerous to leave money lyin' around here.

Oh, so you don't trust me, huh?
Well, look what we have here.
Well, bless their sleepy little heads.
Maybe we been talking too loud.
Yeah. Shh.

I hope they can swim.

What's this, Sergeant?
That's no way to camouflage a gun.
Whose is it?

How long have you been in the marines, son?
Six months, sir.
That's long enough to know better.
That's Artillery Caton, all right.
Snoopin' around this early, huh?

{y:i}As a matter of fact,
{y:i}not much to defend it with.

Trouble with that guy, he ain't got no finer instincts.

I suppose you've already discovered,
Randall, that we have no brig here.
Yes, sir.
{y:i}You know, I haven't got
{y:i}much faith in brigs, anyway.
No, sir.
Putting a marine in the brig is a waste of good manpower.
That's right, sir.
I'll see these men in the morning, Sergeant.
In the meantime,
I'll try and think of some way... of diverting your surplus energy into more useful and constructive channels.
Yes, sir.
I don't like the sound of that
"constructive channels" stuff.
No, sir. Aw, what am I sayin'?
Hey, if this is a sample of Caton's constructive channels, give me the brig.
What are we diggin' here, anyway?
A slit trench.
Huh?
Bomb shelter for air raids.
What bombs and which air raids?
- What's on your mind, pal?
- Oh, nothing.
I was just wondering what would happen if marines had to do a good day's work.
What do you suppose they give you for bustin' a civilian?
In self-defense?
Naw,just bustin' him.
With or without provocation?
Both.
For bustin' a guy like that, I guess they'd give you the Medal of Honor.
Come on. Back to nature.
Hey, what's happened here?
Pete just passed out.
Too much sun.
Get him over to the hospital.
I'll take charge while you get another man for the tractor.
Okay, Mac.

What goes on?
Orders, Mr. McCloskey.
Whose orders? For what?
Civilian air raid drill.
Here. Here it is.
"Approach of enemy aircraft will be signaled by long blast on claxon horn.
All civilian workers will thereupon take cover."
Where'd you get that?
Major Caton's office.
Major Caton! Well,
I might as well shake that guy out of my hair right now.
It's my job to keep those men out there working and the machinery rolling.
If they're gonna run in the bushes every time a brass hat toots a horn,
I'm gonna wind up behind the eight ball.
The responsibility for the life of every man on this island is invested in us.
In times like these, air raid drill is necessary.
In times like these, it's necessary for you guys to let me get my job finished.
We're just as anxious as you are for you to finish your job.
Right. Then quit stampedin' my men with that peewee auto horn and let me get to it!
Everybody must participate in the air raid drill.
{y:i}There will be no exceptions.
So it's a must, is it?
Exactly.
Well, General, the first man of mine that ducks in the bushes when the horn blows... is gonna get a two-by-four over his head.
Mr. McCloskey!
Sir, I'm going to give you a bit of advice.
Orders from the United States
Navy Department will be obeyed!

Oh, Mr. McCloskey.

Yes, I had an accident, all right.
I tripped. Why?
Well, can I be of any assistance?
No.
Carry on.
From Commander Roberts, sir.
"Special Japanese envoy will arrive on the Clipper."
Gentlemen, it is my great privilege... to propose a toast to that great executive... of your great democracy... whose lasting peace it is my country's... greatest wish to preserve.
Gentlemen, I give you... the president of the United States,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Hear, hear!
Thank you.
Gentlemen, I give you
His Imperial Majesty,
Emperor Hirohito of Japan.
As you all know,
I am on my way to Washington.
With me I carry a message from my emperor... to the president of your country.
Gentlemen, it is a message of peace.
I regret very much to say... that between my people and your people... there have been some small misunderstandings.
But it is, therefore, my emperor's desire...
{y:i}that I show to your president
{y:i}the heart of the Japanese people.
{y:i}And I do solemnly swear... that in that heart he will find no thought of war... but, rather, a yearning for lasting peace.
Therefore, gentlemen,
I ask that you wish me Godspeed.
On this clear and peaceful
Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, as countless thousands of you are enjoying the security of your homes, a great drama of U.S. Japanese relations is moving swiftly to a climax.
In the State Department, at this precise moment,
Mr. Cordell Hull is receiving for a final interview...
Ambassador Nomura and
Special Envoy Saburo Kurusu of Japan.
It is understood that
Special Envoy Kurusu... has brought with him
Emperor Hirohito's reply... to President Roosevelt's note protesting Japan's aggression in the Far East.
This morning Envoy Kurusu stated that his emperor's message would, he was confident, solve the Pacific problem.
So today, for the first time in many anxious months, a new note of optimism and hope marks the tempo of the Washington scene.
Why don't you quit listenin' to that guff?
Get somethin' romantic.
Myrtle, honey, I'm on my way.
So you're really gonna go, huh?
Yep.
Oh, and by the way, you owe me 10 bucks.
You haven't left yet.
I ain't dressed up for no
Sunday morning inspection.
One look at you in that outfit, and the old man'll throw the book at you.
Well, I got his permission, see, Mr. Smart Guy.
Mr. Randall Caton says,
"You are now a gentleman of leisure.
And if you wish to travel in formal attire," he says, "it's okay by me."
Mr. Aloysius K. Randall, Esquire, back in circulation.
How do you like that?
Hey, what's your hurry?
The Clipper doesn't leave just this minute.
Well, I'm gonna have Sparks radio Myrtle to lay in a supply of orange blossoms.
World, here I come!

Well, I'll take a chance on this one.
You're the best mechanic I've ever met.
Thank you.
You're Russian, aren't you?
No, Lieutenant. Polish.
A Pole, huh? What on earth got you into the Marine Corps?
Well, I had my wife and two children.
They were in Warsaw.
{y:i}[ Man ]
{y:i}Ready on number five.
Number five all set.
You must be glad, Lieutenant, you are not married.
Probenzki, my wife's at Pearl Harbor.
Everything in order, gentlemen?
I was just hearing the doctor's plans, sir.
Emergency stations have been set up at all key positions, sir.
Very good. How about you, Patrick?
Four planes in the air, sir.
The other eight in reserve.
There'll always be four aloft?
That's right, sir.
What have you been able to do about the civilians?
I've ordered them to take cover in the slit trenches wherever possible.
Good.
I'd like to see those stations, Doctor.
Aye, aye, sir.
That blasted air raid alarm again!
It's got my men running around like gophers!
The major will take care of you, McCloskey.
That's the man I want to see!
You got a piece of paper?
You can have my resignation.
You wanna run my job?
Well, run it.
I'm afraid that won't be quite practical at the moment for either one of us, McCloskey.
Why not?
The Japs have just bombed
Pearl Harbor.
Say that again.
The Japs have just bombed
Pearl Harbor.
The Pan American Clipper will take off as soon as Commander Roberts deems it advisable, and there'll be a place on it for you.
In the meantime, find yourself some shelter and stay out of the way.
All right, Patrick.
I'll take a look at your situation.
Yes, sir.
Hiya, guys.
Hey, Johnny, don't look now, but I think we got a fifth columnist.
Naw, he ain't no fifth columnist.
Not with that hat, he ain't.
Run along, sonny. No tramps, agents or peddlers allowed.
Aw, lay off me, will ya, fellas?
I was just passin' time till the Clipper leaves.
I was wonderin' how your new partner was makin' out, Joey.
Don't worry about me.
I'm doin' all right.
Yeah? Well, pick up that ammunition chest, then.
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[ Laughs ]
All right, Randall.

Are you speakin' to me?
Yeah, I'm speakin' to you.

Yes, sir?
Advise Dr. Parkman it'll be necessary to evacuate his emergency hospital as soon as possible.
Aye, aye, sir.
Hello, Lewis, Patrick.
We've got to get Dr. Parkman and his people underground.
This has been a checkerboard bombing, and that sort of stuff is no respecter of hospitals.
Lewis, suppose you pick a good spot and detail a work party.
Aye, sir.
Patrick, how'd you make out with your outfit?
Twenty-three wounded, seven killed, sir.
Seven planes out of commission.
All the oil and gasoline on the field destroyed.
Even the big tanks?
That's right, sir.
That's not so good.
How did the defense battalion make out, sir?
Not bad, considering the strafing we got.
You'll have to admit they did a pretty thorough job of it.
With mathematical precision, square yard by square yard.
When they attack again,
I have the feeling they won't bomb the same square twice.
So it's up to us to move our guns, equipment and supplies to the areas already bombed.
I suggest you follow the same procedure with your planes.
Aye, aye, sir.
Patrick! You and your lads have done a fine job.
We're proud of you.
Thank you, sir.
Keep pitching.
Aye, sir.
Captain Gordon of the Clipper, sir.
Oh, come in, Captain.
My name's Caton.
{y:i}How do you do, sir?
Sorry we had to meet under such unpleasant circumstances.
You about ready to take off?
With your permission, sir.
I don't see anything to hold you, unless our Japanese friends pay us another visit before you get away.

They should be by now, sir.
They were boarding when I left.
Well, good luck and happy landings.
Thank you, sir.

You ain't seen that dog around anyplace, have you?
Never mind the dog. Get going.
That's funny. I ain't seen her since the attack.
Listen, you big dope!
The Clipper's waiting.
You're holding up the parade.
Don't crowd me, will ya!
Get on that Clipper and get on it fast. That's an order.
I'll get on when I'm good and ready.
And don't you give me no orders.
I'm a civilian, see!
Bill, Joe, come here.
Take this civilian and toss him aboard the Clipper.
Go on, get going.
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Come on, boys.
Come and get it.
Come on.
According to facts given me by Corporal Goebbels, sir, the accused refused to get aboard the Clipper, spoke disrespectful to Corporal Goebbels... and assaulted First Class
Privates Bennett and Richmond, causing them grievous bodily harm.
To say nothing of what he did to me, sir.
Silence, Corporal.
Well, Randall, what have you got to say for yourself?
Well, sir--
It's these clothes, sir.
{y:i}What?
Well, since I've been wearing them,
I don't seem to have no control.
{y:i}Control?
Over my emotions.
Randall, if my memory serves me correctly, weren't you before me on a similar charge back in Shanghai?
{y:i}- No, sir.
- No?
No, sir. That time it was the captain of that Italian gunboat.
Remember, the-- the one with the long whiskers?
Oh, yes, I remember now.
- You did a pretty good job on him.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Uh, sir, if it's all the same to you,
I'd like to make the same request
I made then.
To ship over?
Yes, sir.
Randall, as man to man,
I congratulate you on your decision.
But as your commanding officer,
I can tell you now--
Since the beginning of hostilities, you've never been out.
You're a marine for the duration.
If you'd gotten aboard the Clipper, they would have told you.
Now I have a request to make.
Yes, sir?
Burn that dogcatcher's outfit and get back into your uniform!
Sergeant, post him for duty.
That's all.
Left face. Left face!
Forward march!
That's all, Corporal.
Mr. Hogan, sir.
Oh, hello, Hogan.
Hello, Major.
I've brought my report.
Not so good.
Any further instructions?
No.
Just tell the rest of your men to stay under cover, what's left of it.
We'll get it again.
How soon? I don't know.
Yes, sir.
Oh, by the way, did your
Mr. McCloskey get off on the Clipper?
As far as I know.
Oh, so you didn't leave after all?
Thought I was gonna run out on you?
Well--
Well, I was, but I changed my mind.
McCloskey,
I'm glad you're staying.
Why?
We need a man like you.
Good.
Give me a gun.
No.
You can be more valuable than that.
What do I do?
Dig. Dig holes, lots of them, revetments for our planes, shelter trenches.
You'd better start by digging a big one-- one big enough to hold all the casualties in our emergency hospital.
Consider it done.
[ Bugle Call ]
Hard at it?
Running out of spare parts, sir, so we're rolling our own.
Just thought I'd drop in, see how you were doing.
Oh, Major Caton.
Orderly brought a signal over for you.
Thank you.
How's the rest of the world doing?
Not so good.
Cameron.
Yes, sir?
Sit down.
Cameron, I've got some bad news.
Yeah, I heard about it, sir.
What?
You mean about Commander Roberts.
I've heard he's in pretty bad shape.
It's not the commander. It's your wife.
She was killed in the bombing at Pearl Harbor.
I know there's nothing I can say that will comfort you.
You know, Cameron, memories are funny things.
They mold a man.
From the time a man can remember, his main memories are those given to him by women-- his mother, his sisters, his first sweetheart, his wife.
Even those women he might like to forget, even they give him memories that might help sometime.
No, there's nothing I can say that will comfort you.
You're like me now-- a man with a memory,
But we're not alone.
In this war, in any part of the world wherever they've dropped a stick of bombs, they've made thousands like us-- men without wives, without children, without a single thing they've ever loved or held dear.
And for those men, there's a job to do-- to fight, fight with guns and bayonets and tanks... and ships and planes.
Fight to destroy... destruction.
We've got to destroy destruction.
That's our job, Bruce.

What do you mean?
I work hard--
No hard feelings, cookie.
I only meant that if I was back in the States, out with a dame, sitting in some little café, you know what I'd order?
A great big juicy steak about that wide and about that thick.
With onions?
Oh, yeah, with lots of onions.
I'd settle just to be back in the States.
I'd settle just to be with a dame.
With a dame.
Aw, what are we talking about it for?
That's all we can do.
Hey, Smacksie.
What's the matter?
I got a surprise for you.
Yeah, but my chow's gettin' cold.
Look, this is better than chow.
Come on.
What could be better than chow?
Lots of things.
On this island?
All right, so maybe it came from heaven.
What are you talkin' about?
Never mind.
Come around here.
All right.
Now, close your eyes.
Aw!
Come here. Come here.
This is serious.
Now, close your eyes.
Well--
Now, if you had three wishes, what would you wish for?
Myrtle.
Aw, no, something better than Myrtle.
What could be better than Myrtle?
Lots of things.
Yeah, how do you know?
All right, I was stationed at Mare Island too.
Come on. Close your eyes.
Now, wish.
No, it's still Myrtle.

Look, half right, close your eyes and kneel down. Come on.
Now, open 'em.

No, no, they're all ours.
Yeah, it's our dog, ain't it?
Yeah, but I found 'em, didn't I?
Well, we got 'em.
Oh, not this one, you ain't.
Who do they look like?
Well, this one--
Skipper's the only dog that's ever been on the island.
Hey, that's right.

What a beautiful old man.
What a lovely head.
India is filled with old men, memsahib.
But not like the one in the yellow turban.
He's like a head of John the Baptist.
The memsahib refers to the storyteller?
Are these silent monsters at peace with us?
It is but a truce they keep with man.
But I, who have seen their tusks stained red with blood...
I could tell you a tale of the silent ones.
For a few coppers? Eh?
Yea, for a bowl of rice?
What would you do with my image, memsahib?
I would keep it... for a memory of India.
Verily, you would have all India in your picture.
Nay, you would have the book
Of the jungle to read in my eyes.
In the beginning, you must think
Of nothing but silence... a silence so vast that the ear can hear it.
Great trees like the pillars of the temple... with ferns like green carpets underneath.
While above, under the dome of heaven
Where lived the winged ones... the wind moves restlessly,
Whistling across the roof of the world.
These are the eaters of grass
In a world of torn flesh.
Early the little fawns
Must learn their lesson__... feet that make no noise, eyes that see in the dark... ears that hear the leopard leaving his lair.
For the leopard lives by the law
Of claw and horn and fang...
He will kill for hunger and eat thereof... but he will never kill fork killing's sake ... a law all men break. but the jungle folk obey.
These are the lords of the jungle.
The tribe of Hathi, the silent ones.
They go their way, eaters of grass
In a world of carnage.
For the wolves are the true hunters of the jungle.
And like huntsmen,
They stick to their Clan... with a strict regard
For hunting Calls and tribal law.
Free Companions of the woods, they may
Fight and quarrel amongst themselves... until the strongest of them wins
The leadership of the pack.
Yet jungle folk say... the wisest amongst them is the tribe of Baloo, the bear.
He is a teacher of the jungle law.
Yet there is one who knows law__... the barrel-bodied mugger, the Crocodile... with his chin in the shallows
And lust in his cold heart... hoping to drag down to the depths
All who wander along his river bank.
And in the legends of the jungle
There is a black prince... shrewdest of the lords of claw,
Horn and fang...
As bold as a buffalo, as reckless as a wounded elephant... with a voice as soft as wild honey
Dripping from a tree.
Unbridled, unmastered, unafraid.
Bagrheera the black panther.
And now__
Behold, the villain of my tale.
The killer, the man-eater... the assassin who first brought murder to the jungle Clans.
Shere Khan, the tiger.
It is said that in his first kill__... when he was Cain to some
Poor Abel of the glades __... when he ran from the scene of his crime... the trees and creepers
Whipped him with their branches... and striped his yellow hide with the mark of Cain.
This evil lord must have his dish-lickers... his bullies for attendants.
Tabaqui the jackal.
And the hyena__... hungry for the scraps
Of their murderous master's feast.
But my tale is not alone
Of outcasts and heroes.
I will tell you also of the snake, Kaa, the wise one... the oracle who taught Mother Eve
The speech men use... for trickery and sin.
What is the book of life itself but man's war with nature... the struggle between village and jungle,
Under the mantle of wild creepers
And great trees... many a ruined City lies forgotten in the pages of time.
Yea, where a thousand war Chariots
Proclaimed the might of a great king... before whom all men bowed their heads.
Nothing remains but a trellis
For wild figs to sun upon.
But what of the great maharaja,
The loser in this battle?
He has left many such a palace
To his Cousins, the monkey folk.
The bandar-logs __
The outcasts of the jungle.
First you must picture me as I was, milords...
Buldeo, the mighty hunter.
It was a long time ago... and very far away... on a summer's evening in the Seeonee hills.
Ajao. Ajao.
Again some palaver.
Its Buldeo, master.
That fool would make speeches the whole day.
Come, Durga. Let, s listen to him.
Ajao.
You cannot build your houses just anywhere.
We have to plan out our village.
Someday there will be a mighty city here.
A mighty city with marble houses.
The temple shall be there, facing the marketplace.
That's where I wanted the bean patch.
No that's for the marketplace, as Buldeo says.
And the barbershop will face the temple.
I shall find someplace for the bean patches anyway-... outside your mighty city.
Go Durga. Take the child and the old man to the cart.
Nathoo.
Come Grandfather.
Did you hear that?
We're going to have a marketplace and a temple and a mighty city.
Aye we'll have all that
If we can beat the jungle.
But have you and your hundred years seen man win a war with nature?
Sit here Grandfather.
There Nathoo.
Now.
Go back to your work.
Nathoo?
Where are you my baby?
Rao. Look. Our little Nathoo, he has wandered away.
Now don't worry Messua.
The child couldn't go far.
I'll look for him right away.
Durga you search in there.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
- Nathoo.
- Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nat...
Buldeo.
Tiger. My husband.
Rao.
Abdullah. Singh.
Abdullah. Ali. Mohammed. Singh.
Tiger.
No.
No.
Poor master.
Poor Messua.
Let us all go and look for the child.
All men bring your spears.
Ali Singh Abdullah. Torches.
Follow me.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Poor little baby. Poor little Nathoo.
- And that poor mother.
- Poor mother
Is it every woman who can have a wolf nurse her baby for her?
Do you believe that Subahdar?
Oh yes memsahib.
And His Excellency your father, has many records... of wolf children from the Indian hills.
- It is true.
- True?
In the beginning was it not written... that the she-wolves loved the children of man?
Were not the wolves the foster parents
Of many a child in India?
Little naked and bold... the man's Cub entered the wolves' Cave.
Ahai.
He felt just as much at home with the cubs as at his mother's side.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Lost and tired, he fell asleep among his brothers of the jungle.
Akkela the father wolf,
And Rakksha the mother wolf... knew that Shere Khan is prowling outside
Looking for the man Cub.
So they took him into their family.
Nathoo.
He grew up with the cubs.
They called him Mowgli-- the Little Frog.
Father wolf taught him his business until every rustle in the grass... meant just as much to him as to his brothers the wolf cubs.
All the lords of the jungle became his friends.
He had only one enemy-
Shere Khan the tiger.
Did Mowgli live to hunt Shere Khan?
Did he live? Oh.
But had I known then what I know now.
Twelve years had passed... and Shere Khan was on the trail

Wait. Wait.
Let me handle him.
Buldeo. Buldeo.
Ow. He bit me.
He is a wild boy.
Cover him up. Cover him up.
Who are you boy?
Can't you hear?
Give me a torch. A torch.
Give me that torch.
This boy has never seen fire before.
He's from the jungle.
Yes he is a wild boy.
We must be kind to him. Release him.
Release him?
Are you mad?
This is a thing of the jungle.
Let me look. Let me look.
Look at the scars on his arms and legs.
Those points on his bones--
He has run on all fours... with wolf cubs.
Poor child.
This boy has been reared in the jungle.
He has the evil eye.
I begin to think he has.
Moonshine.
I think this boy is Messua's little baby which was stolen that day we built the wall.
Could this boy be your's Messua?
No. He's not mine.
But he's a handsome boy.
Eyes like red fire.
Any woman would like to have a son like him.
But my Nathoo was soft and plump.
But, mistress, how could he be plump running naked in the woods?
I warn you all. He has the evil eye.
No, Buldeo.
He is some poor, lost lad-- though not my own.
But I am a lonely woman, and if you would let me...
I will shelter him for some other woman who has lost her son.
He is a wolf.
Let one in, and all will follow.
He will bring down the jungle upon us.
What the jungle has taken,
The jungle has restored, Buldeo.
Aye. Aye.
Take this boy into thy house my sister.
And out of your little hoard of money, forget not to honor me... for I have saved his life on this day.
- Release him.
- Wait.
Are you going to turn this devil loose before I can protect you?
A gun.
- Buldeo--
- Don't...
A gun.
Buldeo.
Now release him.
No.
No.
Boy.
Boy.
Will you come with me?
Come.
Oh. It's, it's all right.
Come on.
Come along. Come.
Come.
It's all right. Come along. Come.
It's all right.
Down upon our heads even before the temple... we have called the curse of the beast.
No more shall we prosper.
The wild pig will trample down our vines.
The tiger will stalk our streets.
We have opened our doors to the devil.
Don't look upon evil.
Mahala. Get home to bed.
At least I can keep my own daughter from harm.
Get back, Kpota.
Is that anyway to treat one who has come to live with us?
I remember the day I gave the first little shoes to my Nathoo.
Wolf-- Uh, wolf boy.
Uh...
Oh, those feet have never worn shoes.
No, you are not my son.
But you look very much like my son Nathoo.
Nathoo called me 'Mother'.
'Mother'.,
'Mother'.,
M-- Mother.
Uhh.
And what did the wolves... call you?
Wolves.
M...
Mowgli.
Mowgli?
A little frog?
Yes, you were like a little frog to them, the beasts of the jungle.
And so you are Mowgli to me.
Come.
Come on.
For months and months after that night...
Mowgli was busy learning the ways,
Language and customs of men.
What are you doing?
You are like a little panther.
I thought someone had found the hiding place.
- Hiding place?
- Mm-hmm.
- What is this?
- Money.
What is it for?
What is money for?
To protect us from hunger and cold.
It lives in a hole like a cobra?
No.
If we need a bag of rice, I give these to the merchant in the square.
He gives us the rice.
- What a fool that merchant must be.
- No.
Will the Man-Pack give us anything for this?
Yes.
Will Buldeo give me a tooth?
Tooth? You have all your teeth.
No. A -A sharp tooth.
Oh, a knife?
Yes. A knife tooth, like a tiger's knife.
What need have you for a knife?
To sink it in the throat of my enemy.
Your enemy? Ha. You talk about
Akela, the father wolf... and Raksha, the
Mother wolf, and how much... better it is in the jungle with all your friends.
Now who could be your enemy?
Shere Khan, the tiger.
Tell Buldeo to sell you a knife.
Give him the money.
I shall have a tooth.
I shall have a tooth.
My father says I mustn't speak to you.
What happened to him?
My father shot him.
We missed you six moons ago.
He was Baloo's cousin.
He had no man for an enemy.
But my father kills every bear he sees.
Why?
Because he is a great hunter.
He kills them even when he's not hungry?
Hungry? We don't eat bears.
Then why did he bring him here?
To show how brave he is.
And my father was very brave to kill that tiger.
That old tiger?
He lived on lizards and rats.
He was too old to hunt rabbits.
He must have died in his sleep.
I see. You could kill the bear and the tiger with one shot.
I kill Baloo's cousin?
I've gone fishing with him.
Fishing with a bear?
How can a bear bait a fishhook?
He looks in the river, he sees the fish he wants, then who.
He knocks it out.
Didn't I tell you not to speak with this thing?
I told Messua to keep you away from this house.
Messua sent me here to talk to you.
She sent me to get a tooth.
A tooth?
Yes. This is the tooth I want.
Put that knife down before I send a shot through you.
And then you would put my head on the wall... like the old Khan there.
But I would spring as I die and give this tooth back to you.
Now, now.
You're not in the jungle, boy.
No.
No, I am not in the jungle, Buldeo.
I am with the Man-Pack, but I am not a man.
What are you, boy?
I was until now a cub.
But now I have my tooth.
I can run with the jungle as I please.
I am a wolf.
If you had a knife... would you go back to the jungle?
The knife is yours for two annas.
Messua gave me three.
One, two, three.
There. Three is more than two.
Yes. More than two.
Now get out of my house.
See, Shere Khan?
- 'Tis for you-- deep in your throat.
- Mowgli.
Won't you be afraid to go back to the jungle?
Afraid of the jungle? Why?
I'm of the wolf pack.
They are my friends.
Then why did you buy the knife?
For Shere Khan, the tiger.
This is for him.
He drove me out of the jungle.
He went away far off... but he swore he would lay my bones in the river when he returned.
I also made a little promise.
I have told the wolves I would kill him.
You can speak their tongue?
You can speak to animals?
Can you talk to Rama, the great herd bull?
Rama is a dumb slave.
He has been with the Man-Pack so long... he cannot talk to anyone.
Can you speak to him?
What did he say?
Don't you know what the monkey people always say?
'We, the monkey people, are the greatest folk in all the jungle.
We know this is true because we always say it is true.
Mowgli, will you let me
Hear you talk to the wolves?
Yes.
Tonight when the moon rises.
- Are you afraid?
- No.
Let's go.
It's a wolf. What did he say?
Wood and water.
Wind and tree.
Jungle favor go with thee.
You have been given the favor of the jungle.
We be of one blood... you and I.
We be of one blood, you and I.
Come, Mowgli. Come.
Come. Come.
Ahai, Hathi.
I am with the Man-Pack now.
See, I have my tooth-- as sharp as a tiger's tooth.
He said Shere Khan is far away... but I had better take care and hide when he comes back here.
Hathi, will you warn me when he comes back to our jungle?
Thank you, brothers.
Then we shall see whose bones will be laid in the river.
Hold on. Tight.
Bagheera.
Mowgli.
Your claws are sharp and strong.
But not as good as mine.
Look.
Who is man that I should care for his ways?
Brown digger, eater of earth.
I am Mowgli of the jungle, back in the night.
Now that I have my tooth, who shall stay me when I strike?
Mowgli, come back.
I'm afraid.
There.
Mighty hunters, greater than your father... who killed everything until the jungle killed them.
Why did they go away?
Why did I go away?
Because I was a man cub, afraid of a tiger.
The jungle knew I was afraid and cast me out.
This was the king's palace.
King?
What is a king?
Oh, Mowgli. You know so much, and yet you know so little.
This was a great walled city... a city with hundreds of elephants and thousands of horses... and thousands and thousands of men.
And it all belonged to a great king.
And where is this great king now?
And where is this great king now?
Where is he now?
Where is he now?
Mahala?
Mahala?
- Mahala?
- Mowgli. Mowgli.
Here I am.
Mahala, are you hurt?
No, I'm all right.
The king's treasure chamber.
Look.
The emeralds.
Pearls.
This is like the stuff I gave Buldeo for my tooth.
The stuff that passes from hand to hand and never grows warmer.
Only this is yellow, and that was brown.
Let's get back to the light.
These pebbles are no good to eat.
There is nothing here. Nothing.
Am I nothing?
Father of cobras, we be of one blood, you and I.
She's only a little cub from the Man-Pack.
She means thee no harm.
Who art thou with the knife and the snake's tongue?
Mowgli, they call me.
I am of the jungle.
The wolves are my people.
Father of cobras, who art thou?
I am the warden of the king's treasure.
The great king built the stone above me that I might teach death... to those who come to steal.
Three times the stone has been lifted by thieves.
Look at thy feet.
The thieves are still here.
But I am no thief.
Indeed.
Be still, Mahala. Be still.
Oh, no, boy.
Let her run to and fro a while.
Let her make some sport.
The others did so until I touched them.
Then they whimpered a while... sighed and were still.
Kill him, Mowgli. Kill him.
Kill him?
Don't be afraid.
Look. Our father of cobras is so old, he has outlived his poison.
Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.
I am ashamed.
There has been too much talk of killing.
Come, Mahala. We'll go now.
Keep that silly treasure.
But I'll take this.
I can use it to prod Rama with.
Look at the ruby, Mowgli.
You could buy hundreds of villages with it.
Aye, boy. Thousands of villages.
Take it with thee.
But see that it does not kill thee at last.
Kill me? This stone?
Yes. I have outlived my poison... but that ruby holds more death than all my tribe.
It will kill and kill and kill... for killing's sake.
My strength is dried up, but this stone will do my work.
It is death, it is death, it is death.
But take the ruby if thou wilt.
Nay, father of cobras. I believe thee.
We shall go as we came.
Aye.
Ye be wise to take no death with thee.
May I take just this one piece, Mowgli?
Keep it if you like.
Get up, lazy bones.
I dreamed I was a princess in the city of the great maharaja.
Get up.
There's no fire in the grate, and there is no rice here.
But it was not a dream.
I saw the great king's city.
Get on with you.
Enough of this talk.
Dream?
This is no dream.
Maybe I am dreaming.
This is pure gold.
Who gave this to you, my darling child?
The white cobra.
Cobra?
Yes.
I did not want the diamonds.
Diamonds?
Nor the big ruby.
Big ruby?
This big.
This big.
Where? What nonsense is this?
Where is this room-- this ruby?
When did you go there?
Whose gold is this, Mahala?
The great king's gold.
In the treasure chamber
Of the king's palace.
I tell you, Father, Mowgli said
I might keep just this one.
Mowgli?
You have been in the jungle?
Last night Mowgli took me there.
But, Father, you will not hurt him?
I would not harm a hair on his head.
But you must never let anyone know about this.
Not a living soul, do you hear?
Yes, Father.
Good morning, Buldeo.
Good morning.
I-I can't take you now, Buldeo.
It'll be at least another hour.
Now wait a minute, Barber.
There-There is no river between us.
Oh. Oh, my-- my poor leg.
Uh, uh -This lumbago is killing me.
I can't go around with half my beard cut.
Ooh. Th--This lumbago is terrible.
I-- I-I can hardly bend my knee.
What makes you tremble like wash upon a line?
Now you keep out of this, Buldeo.
If I cut him, he-he doesn't have to pay.
- Y-You want to cut me?
- No, no.
Now listen here, barber.
I'm not a man to be shorn like a sheep in the midst of a brawl.
- Barber-
- I want...
- Barber?
- Hmm?
Move your left foot.
Well, uh...
I said the left foot.
Oh, oh, the-the l-l-l-l... l-l-- left.
Left.
This foot.
Excuse me, Buldeo.
You are standing on my money.
- Your money?
- I saw it first.
Jackals....
- It's mine.
- There's no need to quarrel.
- There's enough for all.
- Where? Where?
There's a lost city... in the jungle.
- You have found a treasure.
- Where?
Shh. Do you want to tell the whole village?
Not a word now.
My daughter found it with the jungle boy.
Tiger's coming.
Up, you dumb ones. Up.
Up. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho.
Tiger. Tiger.
- Th-Th-The--
- Tiger.
To the temple. To the temple.
To the temple.
To the temple, all of you.
Shut the gates. Shut the gates.
Tiger. Tiger.
- Quickly, Little Frog, to the temple.
- No. Not I.
- I have my tooth.
- No, no. Don't go. Don't go.
Mowgli.
Wait.
Don't go. He will kill you.
No. I shall bring back his yellow hide.
Mowgli.
Mowgli.
Where is your son, Messua?
Where did he go?
Stop him. He has gone after the tiger.
Oh, that bragging of a child.
Don't be impatient, Buldeo.
He'll be back.
Suppose the tiger should kill him.
Ooh, what a tragic calamity.
No, no, we must save him.
We must bring him back.
How kind you all are to comfort me this way.
He really is a sweet boy.
I knew you would come to love him.
Love him? I wish I had a boy like him.
Now, don't worry.
If he's not back in a short time,
I'll track him to the ends of the earth.
Kaa.
Kaa.
I want to sleep.
Go away.
I have to talk to you.
Who are you?
Can't you see, Kaa?
What does the Law of the Jungle say?
We be of one blood... ye and I.
Ye come.
Ah.
It is a manling.
It's I, Mowgli, Kaa.
The Little Frog... the one that used to throw stones at me?
I was a cub then, Kaa.
You called me a flat-headed earthworm.
Forgive me... for you are a wise, old, strong... and most beautiful Kaa.
True.
I am beautiful.
Yes.
I am beautiful.
Now that I am a man,
I have a tooth.
I wish to pull the whiskers of death.
The striped one?
You know all things?
I know that Shere Khan has killed... and eaten... and now sleeps by the bamboo.
Tabaqui the jackal told me so... uh, before he passed on.
Tabaqui?
Yes, indeed.
Here he is.
How may I slay his master, Kaa?
He'd kill you with one blow.
Let us go upstream.
Hold on, little brother.
Shere Khan is nothing but a big cat... and all cats fear the water.
But Shere Khan will not follow me into the river.
Since you're a man... use your cunning.
And if I made him angry, Kaa... will he follow me into the river?
If he will not catch you first.
Thank you, wisest of all.
Go on.
I'll wait for you here.
Wish me good hunting...
O wise, strong and most beautiful Kaa.
Good hunting.
Good morning, Shere Khan.
Did I wake you up?
You hunter of worms... you striped cattle thief.
Don't sneak away.
Coward.
You mangy yellow dog.
Come back.
Can't you jump?
Are you too old, you frog eater?
Fish killer.
I'll get your hide today.
No, no. I won't come down.
You come up to me.
Get this.
And this.
Bah.
Come on, Shere Khan. Catch me.
- This is getting dangerous.
- Yes.
Maybe there are tigers waiting for us in this tall grass.
All right.
Stay here.
Shere Khan is dead.
I have killed Shere Khan.
What if he finds the boy and tears the secret from him... and-and then says he didn't find him?
You're right.
We cannot trust him.
Uh, you go first, and I'll protect your rear.
You go first, and I'll protect your rear.
Go on.
By the Bull that bought me,
I made a promise... a little promise.
Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.
Come, Shere Khan.
Lend me your coat.
You won't need it anymore.
You don't need to shoot, Buldeo.
I have killed him.
Look at him.
This is the end of a very old war.
Hmm. You have killed him.
You found him there.
I killed him with my tooth.
He is mine.
Who are you to tell me what is yours?
Get up, boy.
You took my daughter to the jungle last night.
You took her to a lost city.
Come on.
Take me to the treasure chamber.
I will not take you, Buldeo.
The Lost City is a city of death.
The treasure is death.
- I will never take you there.
- Come on, jungle brat.
Come on, or I'll shoot you.
- Go ahead and shoot.
- You scum of the wolf cave.
I-I hope he didn't shoot the boy.
No. No.
That's a sign for us.
Change back to a man... and spare my life.
Spare my life, Mowgli.
I did not know you were anything more than a herd boy.
May I rise up and go away... my lord?
Get up.
Go. Tell Messua that Mowgli has avenged her man.
He has killed Shere Khan and will bring home his yellow hide.
Maharaja.
Look.
Great king.
Go on.
Maharaja.
- Maharaja.
- Great king.
- Tell me the secret too.
- Tell me too.
They say there's enough for three.
- Great king.
- Great king.
Three old vultures.
- Go back to your village.
- Yes, milord.
- Ma-- Maharaja.
- My king.
- Where -Where is the treasure?
- Go back to your village.
Maharaja. Great lord.
Here. Here, you.
- Did he tell you the secret?
- Come on. Where's the treasure?
Do ¡V Don't try to cheat us.
The boy told you where to go.
Boy indeed.
Didn't I tell you the first time I saw him he was a witch?
I saw him with my own eyes change himself into a black panther.
Come on, Buldeo. No tricks now.
If you try to cheat us, we'll change you into something worse, I swear to you.
Get down, Bagheera.
Stop their quarrel.
The boy turned himself into a black panther before my eyes.
He is a witch, I tell you.
I must warn the village.
- Buldeo--
- Here.
I still think you're lying, and I'll soon find out.
Ho.
Ho.
Come, Shere Khan.
Look at Buldeo, the mighty hunter.
Ho.
Ho.
Now go get him. Get him.
What have I done?
Why do you stand there gaping so?
Gather branches. Build a fire.
Remember, he must have a chance to confess.
Yes, the three of us will deal with him alone.
We'll deal with him all right.
Clear the way.
Buldeo, we are ready.
Bring the witch-boy.
Well, boy?
Witch or devil, whatever you are... you heard them.
They are ready.
One last choice... the secret or the fire.
Buldeo.
Buldeo.
Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.
Good.
You talk to him.
I will leave you alone.
He won't tell.
I think we'll have to burn him.
Then we would never find the treasure.
We'll burn him... but not now.
The boy will lead us to the Lost City first.
Nathoo, my little son... why won't you tell them the secret?
Never will I take them into the jungle.
But they will set you free... free to live with me.
- Live with you?
- Aye.
I have a jungle mother too... and these two things fight together in me... like the snakes fight together in the spring.
I was a wolf.
The jungle cast me out.
I am a man.
The Man-Pack cast me out.
But you have killed Shere Khan.
You can go back to the jungle.
Aye, you can be lord of the jungle.
No.
I have nowhere to go... but into the Red Flower-- the fire.
No.
But it does not matter.
The jungle will know from Bagheera that I have killed Shere Khan.
No. The jungle will know from you, Mowgli.
See? Here is your tooth.
Mother.
Watch, watch, watch, watch.
- See them'
- He'll escape.
Are you also too dumb to see it?
Of course. He'll escape, and then we'll follow him to the treasure.
That's right.
You two go to the edge of the jungle.
Wait there and mark his trail.
Go.
Your time is up.
It's the mother witch who freed him.
Get her.
Wait. Wait.
Messua is no witch.
But Buldeo is a bad...
Tie both of them until I return.
Buldeo. He entered by this tree.
He never suspected we let him escape.
Don't say that.
See?
There is his trail.
I'm ¡V I'm frightened.
Hmm.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We have our guns.
Let's go.
We can't be very far away.
Listen, brothers.
I have planted tracks for them as deep as an elephant's.
They will be here soon.
Quiet, you grinning black shadow.
Quiet, gray brother.
This is not our kill.
- Look, look.
- Look.
- Wait for me.
- Not so fast....
I will be the maharaja.
I will be the maharaja.
I will be the maharaja
Of this mighty city.
I will be the chief of all the temple.
I will be the chief of all the temple.
I will have all the barber shops.
I will have all the barber shops.
Let's look for the treasure.
Let's look for the treasure.
You look over there.
Uh--
Look.
I found it. I found it.
He found it.
Come on. He found it.
Wait for me.
Wait for me.
He found it. Come on.
Wait for me, Buldeo.
- Let us go in there.
- Let us go in.
I-I-- I found it.
I-I claim the right of first choice.
That's right. You deserve it.
He goes first.
I'll help you.
Help yourself. I'll help you.
Shoot. Shoot.
Sh-Sh-- Shoot.
Don't ¡V Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Shoot. Shoot.
No, no. Don't ¡V Don't shoot. Don't.
Pull me out. Pull me out.
Pull me, Shoot, will you?
Pull me up.
You missed him.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
A million.
I'll never have to count again.
Maybe we've been cheated.
It's gold. It's gold.
It's the mother and father
Of all the rubies in the world.
Where's my royal turban?
They're all pure gold... and they're all mine.
I shall walk upon gold.
I shall eat upon gold.
I shall use gold for a coverlet.
- Give it to me.
- Give it to me.
- It's mine.
- Give it to me.
No. Are you mad?
Shall I bash your heads in?
- Give it to me. I had first choice.
- No, it's mine.
The old cobra was right.
First, they go mad.
Don't forget, Buldeo, we are two to one.
I want that ruby.
- Let go.
- It's mine.
- Let go.
- You miserable barber.
It belongs to my robe.
It belongs to me, you understand?
- It's mine.
- Have we lost our reason?
Are we children?
Isn't there enough for three, 300, 3,000?
We'll be the most powerful men in all India.
Here.
I can buy thousand of rubies like this with my share.
Buldeo, you are wise and good.
You saved my life.
You killed the cobra.
You are my friend.
Then stop quarrelling.
Load yourselves up.
We have to get out before nightfall.
Hurry. We've got to get out of here now.
Thieves. Vultures.
Get out of the jungle.
Get out.
D-Did I hear what I heard?
The panther spoke with the tongue of the boy.
Yes.
The boy spoke with the tongue of the panther.
This place is bewitched.
Oh, the gold.
This is the way.
Where's the log? It was here.
How do we cross now?
We can wade through.
Wait.
There are crocodiles in this river.
What are you waiting for?
- It's this way.
- No, no. We came past this tree.
- I tell you, it's this way. Come on.
- No.
Quiet. Don't argue, Barber.
You're going the wrong way.
You're going the wrong way.
Give it to me.
- Wait here. Come on. Come on.
- Look.
They are heading back to the Lost City.
- Here it is. There it is. Come on.
- Over there is right. Let's go.
Come on.
Now I shall see if Father Cobra spoke the truth.
If the thing is death... these men will die.
You saw it.
I only wanted to look at the gold.
And he-- he tried to kill me.
I had to do it, Buldeo.
I had to do it.
Naturally.
You -You must bear witness.
Please, you must bear witness, Buldeo.
Quiet, gray brother.
He tried to kill me, Buldeo.
You must bear witness.
I had to kill him.
I had to kill him, Buldeo.
He...
Help. H-H-Help.
Help.
Did I hear someone call?
Now, gray brother... there is only one.
Bagheera, gray brother... chase him out of the jungle.
Sing him home.
You grinning monster.
Change into any beast you will.
Wolf, panther... any beast you will.
I'm not afraid of you.
Change.
Change.
Scream.
Scream, you witches of the forest.
Scream.
I'll burn that mother witch Messua... and I'll come back with a hundred strong... and set fire to your jungle... when the east wind blows.
I'll burn you all.
Burn you all.
Burn you all.
Hathi. Thou knowest the village
Of the Man-Pack that cast me out.
They're idle, senseless and cruel.
They do not kill the weaker for food... but for sport.
When they are full-fed, they would throw their own breed into the Red Flower.
This I have seen.
It is not well that the Man-Pack should live here anymore.
Kill them? Why?
What good are their white bones to me?
We shall let the jungle in upon them... and give the village back to the wild gourd vine.
They will burn us both.
Why did you fight them, Durga?
Why did you defend me?
It was I who brought him into the world.
He's my son.
Aye, mistress.
You could have saved yourself, Durga.
No, mistress.
If you must leave the world tonight, it is written that I shall go with you.
Buldeo is here. Look.
Buldeo.
What happened?
- Where is the pundit?
- Where is the barber?
Dead. Both dead.
Killed by the wolfboy.
But I know how to deal with him.
I'll burn him.
Burn him up.
I'll burn him.
We're all lost if the wind turns.
The jungle is burning.
Hurry up, Hathi.
Mowgli.
Where's my mother?
What have you done with her?
They left Messua bound in her house.
They would not let me take her.
They said she was a witch and that the fire would take her.
Now the same fire will take them.
But they were frightened, Mowgli.
Lead them, Mahala, to the little island in the middle of the stream.
- Where we saw the elephants, Mowgli?
- Yes. The fire can't touch you there.
Hurry. The wind is shifting.
Break the door, Hathi.
Break the door.
Push. Push.
Harder. Push.
I knew you would come.
See, Durga?
You'll be safe among them now.
- But you, my son-- Come with us.
Not while one little cub is in danger.
Now, go too.
Go on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Swim, gray brother. Follow me.
This way. Follow me.
Come on, Bagheera.
Come on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Go on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Mowgli.
Come back with us at last.
I am of the jungle.
Their lair is my lair.
Their trail is my trail.
Their fight is my fight.
Ahai.
He's no longer my son.
He's a godling of the woods.
So I didn't have my revenge after all.
I became no Mharaja... of a mighty city.
Even the little village burned to the ground.
In my struggle with the jungle... as you see, milords...
I was beaten.
And then? What happened then?
What became of Mowgli and your daughter?
And how did you escape from the fire?
That, memsahib... is another story.
It's hard to grow old in the dust of the prairie
And a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
The story is told in the dust of the prairie
That a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
There's a stranger in town where a stranger ain't welcome.
He should take some advice and turn right around.
The stranger should flee.
Go back where he came from.
And live a long life away from this town.
And live a long life away from this town.
Evening, stranger.
You must know everybody in town.
Everybody but one. Don't know you.
You do now.
Got a vacant room?
- By day, week or month?
- I do not know.
Because the way you look at it, a man can't be too sure in this town.
I've been here six years and I ain't dead yet.
I'll settle for a week.
Eight dollars cash in advance.
- From Kansas, eh?
- No.
Always put on where I'm going next so I won't forget.
Room 10 at the end of the hall.
Make your own bed.
Furnish your own towel.
Your grip's where you dropped it.
Thanks for the key.
Seven loses.
All right. Get your bets down, boys.
Get your bets down!
Number seven, the winner.
Get your money down, boys.
The man's getting lucky.
Eleven. The man wins.
Get your bets down.
All right, boys. Cover your bets now.
Eight's your point.
Number eight's your point.
He's my man.
We can take a come bet on that.
Eight the hard way.
No thanks. Here you go, dealer.
Next shoot.
Sometime remind me to tell you how much you mean to me.
Sometime remind me to tell you how happy we could be.
Sometime remind me to whisper each dream, each plan, each promise.
But why wait around for sometime?
Why don't you tell me now?
A whiskey, like you pour it for yourself.
Don't you know it's no fun to drink alone?
Not till after the first one.
You a stranger here?
What kind of whiskey was that?
On the bottle, it says rye.
The way you take it, I don't see what difference it makes.
I'll have another rye.
You haven't answered my question.
I am a stranger everywhere.
Got a job?
Listen, fella. I know that one too.
"Got a job, stranger?"
Not? Why don't you join the army.
Three meals a day and a place to sleep.
"A nice warm uniform..."
It's a little more than that.
Yeah, there's one thing more that I could never take.
It's got second lieutenants.
You want to make this a personal matter, all right?
I don't make it anything, soldier.
You tried to sell me something.
I didn't buy it.
Why don't you beat it?
If I weren't wearing uniform,
I might teach you a few manners.
If you could teach me anything, you wouldn't be in a uniform.
You couldn't be looking for trouble, could you?
- I could, but I'm not.
- That's fine.
Because this is one of the best places west of the Atlantic Ocean to find them.
That was my first impression.
That lieutenant is a nice young boy.
I don't doubt it.
But his mouth is too big.
Like your ears.
The view is much better at this table.
And you must like to pick fights.
Only with second lieutenants.
We like second lieutenants here.
You see here everybody fights except the army.
I wouldn't know.
So anyone who doesn't like the army...
I know what you mean.
But I'm afraid I'll have to come back.
You see I...
I like the way you sing.
Captain Iles, commander of the post.
Mr. Haven, sir.
Lieutenant, I see you finally got here.
I seem to finally get everywhere.
Mrs. Caslon, Mr. Haven.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
You met Mr. Stellman.
It came off beautifully, sir.
He picks a good fight.
Matter of fact.
I think I am still a little sore at him.
- Sit down, Mr. Haven.
- Thank you, Captain.
So you're operating under sealed orders.
All this mumbo-jumbo is characteristic of the Military Information Department.
We try to use it as sparingly as possible.
I've been in this territory for a number of years.
I think you'll find it a little rougher here than the suburbs of Washington DC.
Very sensibly.
Then why is M.I.D. sending you here?
Because two soldiers have been murdered.
Those two soldiers were killed while escorting one of the gold stakes.
Is escorting gold one of the functions of your command?
Young man, the functions of my command look very pretty on paper.
But they are not very practical in a territory like this.
What's happening to the gold?
I permitted it to be stored on a warehouse on the post.
Captain, you're in a bad way.
Wells Fargo won't convoy gold.
You tried and failed. Two men are dead.
Gold's piling up at your post.
You can't move it.
The post is undermanned.
You want the quartermaster's plague to replace 7 uniforms.
Sent to the freight office in West Rim City.
The freight building burned down with the uniforms.
I'm not operating a fire department.
And if I were,
West Rim City is 60 miles away.
- That doesn't concern me either.
- Well what does?
The killing of two soldiers.
They were my men, Haven.
I'm trying every way I know to find out who murdered them.
- So will I.
- It may be harder than you think.
I don't know how you operate.
But this is a dangerous job that can get you killed.
You make it sound very difficult, Captain.
Why don't you just wrap up your flag and take it back east with you?
- Look here, Lieutenant.
- Yes?
How will I know what you're doing?
I'll let you know from time to time.
That's very obliging of you.
One thing. I don't want to visit the army post.
Then report to me through
Mrs. Caslon here.
You can be a friend of her husband.
He owned the Argus mine and died last year.
If that meets with your approval.
Only if it meets with hers.
I'd be delighted to help.
- Is that all?
- Yes, I think so.
He really isn't that abrupt.
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night, George.
- Do you see?
- I see.
I think he secretly likes you.
The commander can certainly keep a secret.
- Would you like a little sherry?
- Only if you'll have some too.
Excuse me.
What mine were the two soldiers trying to convoy gold from?
The Argus. It belongs to me.
That brings me to a question
I'd decided not to ask.
Then I'll answer it first.
Captain Isles has asked me to marry him.
I can understand that.
But you can't understand why Capt. Isles should be involved in the gold business.
I do now.
You must realize there's a lot of gold from all over the territory stored at the post warehouse.
- How much would you say?
- Perhaps as much as half a million.
In fact, I have about
$50,000 in my safe now.
Really? Tell me, who is taking all this the gold?
I don't know. That's the worst part of it, not knowing.
That I might find out.
- Don't get into trouble.
- That's why I'm here.
- I know, but does not get...
- Do not worry it.
Trouble and I are old enemies.
We understand each other.
- Good night, Mrs. Caslon.
- Good luck.
How happy we could be...
Every time I come in here you stop singing. Why is it?
You don't have to come in.
Look, I didn't come back to start a fight. Or break the bank.
Why did you come back?
If you invited me to sit down,
I might find out.
It might be better if you found another table.
And another girl.
Oh no, it wouldn't. I looked.
- Could that be Charlie?
- No.
His eyes follow you around like a couple of flies.
They follow me around to see that strangers don't annoy me.
- Only strangers?
- No one else would be so foolish.
Waiter, bring me a bottle of wine, will you?
First you are beautiful.
Then I like the way you sing.
And now you're a woman of mystery.
I don't want to be a stranger.
So I'll have to be foolish.
- You like to take chances, don't you?
- If I feel lucky.
I advise you to try the dice table.
I'd rather get lucky here.
Every man has a right to his own funeral.
I could be your cousin from Waxaharchie.
His cousin John.
A missionary on his way to China.
So Charlie probably runs the town?
What do you care?
I'm going to spend some time here.
I just like to know who winds the clock.
It's been a nice conversation.
I hate to have it end.
Who is this?
- Mick, this is my cousin John.
- From Waxahatchie.
Cousin John is a missionary on his way to China.
What's keeping him?
I think he's wondering if he couldn't do more good here.
You ain't too friendly, are you?
I like to pick my friends.
You ought to learn not to pick them so easy like you do your cousins.
Ask her.
I never saw him before in my life.
You're too little to make that big a mistake.
You gonna correct me or just bleed at the mouth?
Bring him outside.
- What happened?
- I wanted to be my cousin.
And she hasn't any aunts or uncles.
Good boy, Mick.
Look out!
Kill him, Mick.
- Mick will kill him.
- That's ten to one.
Always bet on the champion.
Then you can only lose once.
Ten to one? I'll take it.
You're down. A thousand to a hundred.
Come on, Mick!
Way to go!
Come on, Mick!
That is, Mick!
It's the first time Mick ever got it.
You done a fine job, stranger.
I can't believe this.
Mick Marian losing a fight and me winning a thousand.
Give it to him, Prince.
In chips.
Care for some coffee?
Yeah. Thanks.
They told me who was fighting.
I was getting ready to rent you a room.
- Sugar or cream?
- Cream.
Myself I'd rather buy a forest fire.
So would I.
When a fights a man because of a woman it means that the woman has made the man bold.
But fighting is no good.
Because it just lead to trouble.
And a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
No, a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
Come in.
How do you feel?
Like a million dollars.
You just cost me a thousand.
I brought your hat and coat.
Are you always this sweet to the men who fight over you?
Only the winners.
- Tell me something.
- What?
That fella could have killed me.
Where do you bury the losers?
You talk too much.
What do you want? The next dance?
I think you better sit this one out.
- Have some coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
The way you run this place, I knew you must be good at something else.
Some folks call me the town poet.
Others, village idiot.
Who am I to question either?
How do you feel today?
Like I crawled from Kansas City.
Figures to make you pretty famous.
A lot of folks have been asking for you already.
- Who?
- That gold mine lady, Mrs. Caslon.
- That's nice.
- Couldn't do better.
And Charlie.
- Charlie?
- No less.
You seem impressed.
Why not?
Charlie owns a piece of everything.
Including the undertaker and the sheriff.
Stage line too?
Everything but the windy Bible class.
Even owns a piece of me.
Gets your money while you're here and makes you pay for leave.
Well, when you get next verse of that song, I'd like to hear it.
I can't find a word to rhyme with "Mick Marion."
- Try "carrion".
- Sure, yeah. Carrion.
Doesn't he ever stopping playing?
Sam? It don't bother him. He's deaf.
Where do I find the boss?
First door. Top of the stairs.
Mick been around?
He's indisposed.
Come in.
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.
- They said Charlie?
- Yes.
You're Charlie?
Right.
This is Prince.
Don't ever gamble with him.
You mean with his equipment?
She means either.
See you later, Charlie.
You surround yourself with very affable character.
It makes me feel at home.
No. You're not that sinister.
Last night you were
Florence Nightingale in silk stockings.
Ouch!
Tell me something.
Why did you start that fight?
- I thought you did.
- Oh, really?
You could have insisted
I was your cousin.
Maybe that's not the way I felt about you.
Why did you get the name of Charlie?
It was my father's.
My name is Charlene.
Charlene? I like that better.
This will be the first time
I ever worked for a woman.
What makes you think you're going to work for me?
You sent for me.
All right. I sent for you.
I was doing a nice quiet little business.
Because everybody was afraid of Mick.
Now every time a man has enough drinks in him to feel rugged, he'll try to do what you did.
- Oh, I wouldn't.
- They will.
It's not the kind of job I want anyway.
I don't intend to start at the bottom.
Been there. It's too crowded.
Where do you want to start?
Where the money is.
What would you do for it?
Anything. Except hang.
- How's this?
- Beautiful.
Where'd you get all this?
From my father.
He taught me one thing.
A lot of men think they can beat the tables.
All you have to do is get a table.
Sometimes they run out of cash and I find myself with new responsibilities.
- Such as?
- A couple of stores.
Naw.
I can't see myself behind a counter.
A sawmill and the logging camp.
The logging camp is a long way from town.
Oh. No.
I own the stage line from here to West Rim City but that's a dud.
- Why?
- Outlaws.
Money went in gold shipments.
Now the mines won't ship it.
I'll take that job.
You mean ride shotgun?
Let me run the line.
What do you expect to get out of that?
A commission on all the gold I get through.
We should buy you a small beer.
Glad to get it.
It's pretty dangerous.
Even Wells Fargo locked up that station and quit trying.
Give me a letter of authorization.
I can't bet against you twice, can I?
- Who steals the gold?
- Who doesn't?
All they have to do is put on a mask and they all look like Black Bart.
I forgot to ask you one thing.
I'm working for you now.
You can ask me anything.
How do I know I can trust you?
You don't.
I can?
Only with money.
Okay, boss?
What's your business with me?
I'm the new manager.
Hey, wait a minute. You're not fired.
I gotta be. There ain't work enough here for one man, let alone two..
Two can loaf as easy as one.
Whitey!
This is the new boss, just took over.
Whitey here runs the freight up to the sawmill.
This is Jim Goddard, the regular stage driver.
- Hello, fellas. I don't need the keys.
- Oh.
I saw that fight last night.
It was sure a beauty.
Let's not talk about that.
Right now, it hurts my hand to listen.
I'm supposed to leave here for the sawmill before daybreak.
Is that all right, Mr. Haven?
- Yeah, I guess that's all right.
- Thank you, sir.
What happened to you?
On my last run, I stopped a bullet.
- Get a good look at them?
- I wish I had.
The only thing here that work.
Son, I wasted my time here.
I might as well waste some advice.
You're full of blood and vinegar.
But this whole thing has got something wrong with it.
Goddard only got a nick in the knee.
You may not be so lucky.
I might depend on something besides luck.
Like what?
On the fact, they don't pay to shoot so straight.
They don't need to when they shoot so often.
Worry it over.
I think I'm gonna need you.
But not on one leg.
Take it easy.
Yes, sir.
- What's all this?
- Something, ain't it?
Yeah. Who's is it?
Miss Charlie's, Mr. Haven.
Where do you drive her?
Same places.
Around the hills, down the river.
- Every afternoon.
- Yes?
I think I'll give you the afternoon off.
I shouldn't let you do this, sir.
But I am.
Miss Charlie may not like this.
I will.
Does this Haven move me out?
Is that the play?
Prince, you know I wouldn't part with you.
I always come up empty.
Not quite.
No.
What's the matter, Prince?
I do not like Haven or anything about him.
You said that before.
What do you know about him?
What do you want me to do?
Have him looked up in the Social Registry?
The man walked in out of nowhere.
And went against your table.
- Did he play like a gambler?
- He knew something.
Yes and he took Mick down.
So he knows how to fight.
You like that part, don't you?
I'll tell you one thing, Prince.
I don't like this part.
You know, Prince,
I always find you in good company.
Stand there a second.
Every time I see you, you look different.
But you always look beautiful.
Why is that?
I always have someone to lie to me.
You can take my hand if you won't squeeze it.
Now tell me what are you doing with my buggy?
It's my work.
I'm the new transportation boss.
You hired me.
Where to?
I'm going to call on a gentleman.
At this hour?
His name is Mark Bristow.
At any hour, it'll be strictly business.
The way you say it, you may need a lawyer.
He's a lawyer himself but it won't help him.
No?
What good is a lawyer if he never gets into court?
Oh? Like a doctor in a graveyard.
Where is this unlucky man?
Across the street.
Whoa, boys!
Think I should take the horses back and give them a rubdown?
Think they've gone far enough?
I haven't.
Maybe you better wait and come in with me.
- Hello, Mrs. Caslon.
- How do you do?
I wonder if you could do me a favor?
Why surely.
It's a big favor.
I wouldn't blame you if you refused.
What is it?
I want to run some gold from your mine.
That is a big favor.
I know it seems impossible to you.
But that's one reason I'm here.
To find out what makes that impossible.
Isn't that very risky?
That's why I couldn't go to anyone but you.
I'm just wondering if we shouldn't speak to Captain Iles first?
You know what he would say.
I'd advise against it.
I suppose so.
But if it works my way, it might clear everything up.
For everybody. And for Iles too.
The War Dept does not like all that gold around an army post.
- Well, I...
- We're working too much in the dark.
This may be the only way to see something.
Who else will know this?
Just us. That's all.
And that's the idea.
I'll arrange it.
Good.
Don't look so grim.
It's only your gold and my skin.
And smile when you walk away.
As though we'd been talking about what a dry summer it's been.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Charlie, you know how I've always cooperated as much as possible.
But I haven't the money.
These are all your notes for gambling.
You're out $6,000.
You want to count them?
No.
Your credit is over, Mark.
My luck can change, can't it?
Not in my tables.
I have seen others fall into the trap.
But I didn't think it would get me.
Nobody does.
I'll have Prince come in and look over your books.
Maybe we can work something out.
- But...
- That's the way it is, Mark.
I pay off on the line.
And I expect to get paid.
Oh. What brings you here?
Oh I had a dream you'd be back here tonight.
Why?
Maybe because took the keys.
Don't they go with the job?
You know how it is with a dream.
I got the crazy idea you were gonna try something.
- Like what?
- Well like maybe running a shipment.
And then what happened?
I wanted to be some help with it.
All right. You've been some help.
Now go on back to sleep.
And I'll finish the dream for you.
I'm riding with you, Haven.
I'm riding shotgun.
You got more more than your leg hurt, didn't you?
Maybe I just like to ride in the moonlight if nothing happens.
And if it does?
Then I figure I've got a better right to be there than you have.
All right. Get up there.
We'll go out the back way.
Hold it there.
Hold those horses!
Ho.
Keep your hands away from your guns.
Get down from there and stand aside.
All right, you. Get down.
Bring up the pace horse. Hurry it up.
Get over there.
Bring it up here.
Keep em up.
Take it easy.
They hang you just the same.
All right, Goddard. Get moving.
Go on!
Keep em up.
That's far enough.
Turn around.
This certifies that the bearer, James Goddard, is operating as a legally deputized... detective... for Wells Fargo stage and express company.
Get out!
Where's Joe?
Something's gone wrong, Pete.
Yeah.
I know one thing.
He was born on a horse.
And he didn't just fall off this one.
Go look for him.
- Hello, Whitey.
- Hello, Mr. Haven.
What are you hauling?
This is a load of grub for the sawmill.
How'd you like to ride my horse back to town?
What about the wagon here?
I'll finish the haul.
You're the boss.
Anything exciting happen in town?
I don't know, Mr. Haven.
I left town before daybreak.
Take it easy with Amber. He's tired.
I'll give him good rub then.
Hey you!
Did you see if a rider coming up?
No.
You sure?
I haven't even seen a lizard.
Where can I put this stuff?
Where did you put it before?
I didn't. I'm a new driver.
I think it's grub.
Take them over to the cook shack.
Ho! Hey, you the cook?
No, I just wear this hat to keep the flies off my hair.
It don't matter to me, brother.
I only haul this grub.
I'd just as soon haul it back to town.
Well, take it around the corner.
Well. Any luck?
No sign of Joe. But there's tracks of another horse circling the mill.
That's bad.
Let's go take a look at that new driver again.
Hey, driver!
You, come here.
You sure you didn't see no rider?
Look. You want me to say
I saw a rider, I'll say it.
I'll say I saw a ghost.
It doesn't make any difference to me.
When did you get this job?
Yesterday.
What for?
It's the system.
If I don't work, I don't eat.
I never found any way to beat it.
Who hired you?
Look. I'm working. I high haul this stuff out here.
Nobody tells me where to dump it.
Everybody wants to know where I've been and what I haven't seen. I don't know!
I get 30 cents an hour. How smart does that have to make me?
Forget it.
I got a load for you to take in when you're finished here.
- Sure.
- How soon?
I haven't eaten anything but dust since daylight.
All right. Grab it quick.
What do you think?
We risk him. That's all.
Here. Work on this stuff.
How about a handout?
Help yourself.
Looks pretty good.
It oughta be.
Used to cook for 600 men a day.
Where was that?
Leavenworth.
Who's the boss around here?
I am.
I mean the whole works.
You talked to the man when you came in.
That real tough-looking fella?
They're all tough when they get to Mick Marion.
Mick come around here very often?
Last night.
It looked like somebody got to him.
How's that?
His face all beat up.
Like your knuckles.
No. I had bad luck with a crate of cauliflower.
That's what he brought up here.
A cauliflower face.
Do you fight him?
Mick?
Do I look like I would?
Just the knuckles.
Say you, driver, hurry up.
I'll be right out.
Not many hands here, are they?
All up at the logging camp.
Well, hi-dee-ho.
Much obliged.
This was real fine Mulligan.
I make it better with cauliflower.
It is good, isn't it?
Maybe this ain't such a good idea.
You, come over here.
- Do you see this box?
- Yeah.
It goes to Prince.
You know who Prince is?
- No.
- He runs things for Charlie.
- Do you know who Charlie is?
- Sure.
All right. Get up there.
Oh, one thing.
The gearbox you're hauling in has got to be repaired.
You tell Charlie if it ain't repaired, we might have to shut down quick.
- You got that?
- I got it.
All right. Then get out of here.
Draw the blinds, Bristow.
Light it up.
Can't you put that gun away?
I can but it helps to quiet my nerves.
- A drink?
- No.
We had given you up for dead.
- Who?
- Who?
Why... everybody.
They found Goddard's body.
Didn't you know?
What happened?
Sit down.
If you're trying to imply that you frightened me coming here, you're quite right.
I am neither a hero nor a fool.
They killed Goddard.
Why didn't they kill you?
Someone wanted me alive.
What for?
I don't know.
What do you want from me?
I'm gonna make a statement that you will write and notarize.
Is that all?
Yeah.
You'll put it away where it can't be stolen or tampered with.
- I have a safe.
- I can see that.
Meaning you don't trust me?
I do.
I just don't think you trust yourself.
Where do you want it put?
Mrs. Caslon has a safe. A nice fat one.
I think I can arrange it.
All right.
Here's the statement.
I solemnly swear, that on Thursday last, about 11 pm, the stagecoach I was driving was held up by five armed bandits.
The gold I was hauling was stolen, and Jim Goddard, the guard, was murdered in cold blood.
Are you sure it was Haven you met?
I know my own boss.
Go in and get a beer.
Haven's wagon's across the street.
He must be back in town.
Now I'm wondering what
I get out of this?
Charlie is holding $6,000 of your IOU's.
You're busted.
This will get you even.
And now you wonder why we just don't take all that gold and go around the world.
Monte Carlo, the Taj Mahal...
I've a better idea for you.
Find the gold yourself.
Plant the deposition.
And let me hang for it.
Then you'd be rich. And you won't even need to travel.
That might take some doing.
And some nerve.
- Where do I sign?
- Here.
Don't get so excited.
I'm perfectly calm.
And I'm asking you calmly
How could you allow that scoundrel to transport gold from your mine when you
The man you call a scoundrel may be dead at this moment.
He may be in town at this moment, where in fact he is.
How could you do such a thing without telling me?
I only did it for your sake.
- My sake?
- He represents the US government.
- And who do I represent?
- I was only...
And while we're on the subject, what was Mark Bristow doing here?
Mark Bristow is my lawyer and you know it.
I'm sorry.
I wish you could see that some times you're a little too sure about too many things.
One nice thing about us is we are always wrong together.
Mark gave me this.
That's why I was here.
You're not going to open it?
"To whom it may concern."
It may concern me.
It does.
Your friend, Mr. Haven, still has your gold.
Those nitwits in Washington.
Sending a demoted lieutenant out here to poke around in my business.
You're getting to be a hard man to deal with.
I'm getting to deal with some hard men.
I'll take care of that.
It looks like a board meeting.
What's he doing with you?
I might I might need a lawyer.
I doubt it.
I realize how seldom legal technicalities annoy you.
- But I think I have one that might.
- What's that?
Just a story.
About a man who are murdered.
A thief who got shot.
And a gearbox I failed to deliver.
Probably no one would believe it unless I had killed for it.
- Who else have you told?
- Only Mark.
He is a lawyer and a notary.
He makes it stick.
He finally gets to court.
I don't know anything. I merely wrote the deposition.
You shut up.
Since you brought your lawyer, ask him if this doesn't sound like blackmail.
He can't think very clearly in the presence of a gun.
But it doesn't bother you?
No. It doesn't.
Pete, go downstairs and watch the stairway.
What you want is a cut.
That's right.
It boils down to this.
We can make a deal and all be very happy together.
How could that be?
When I deliver the gold to you.
You mean the gearbox?
I can even forget I looked inside.
So I stole a gearbox.
I'm still a thief.
- What if he gets them?
- He gets even.
Have you lost your mind?
It was all right when he lost his money.
All right.
Prince will give him the IOU's when the gearbox is delivered.
I think that's all.
Haven, you can stay.
You excuse me, Prince?
You know you roll nice dice.
You bet em jam up too.
But one day you're gonna slip.
When you do, I'll be around to catch you.
You know I think he will.
You should be more careful.
I suppose so.
I won't have to have you killed.
I'd have had you hated it.
So would I.
I'd have missed you too much.
And too long.
Did you ever tell a woman you loved her?
All of them.
How'd you get away?
I was always in the doorway when I said it.
You never said it to me.
Let's get over to the doorway.
Don't move. Turn around.
Put ​​the gold in the wagon.
Is this a holdup?
You want to put it in the wagon?
Now was there something you wanted to say?
Yeah.
I followed one of the bandits here when he cached it.
I couldn't haul it on a horse so I came back with a wagon.
I know that's a lie.
Some of it's true.
But not nearly enough.
All right. I'll try it again.
I cached it there myself.
I was going to give it to them.
I wanted to buy membership in their club.
That was the initiation fee.
You see I thought it was worth it.
Well, you see I don't.
What you're doing may get me in trouble.
If you're still in town in 24 hours,
I promise you will be in trouble.
Now start walking.
Go on.
I thought you were in jail?
I talked my way out.
You are a very glib man.
Can you talk your way out of everything?
- Up to a certain point.
- What's that?
The gun. Some champagne, waiter.
Are we celebrating something?
The first time I talked to you, we had champagne.
Didn't you bring me something?
- No.
- But you will?
- No.
- "No." Just like that?
I went to get it. It was there but... so was somebody else.
Who?
Mrs. Caslon.
Alone?
No, she had a gun with her.
Didn't you have one too?
The one she had was in her hand.
You know this could be that slip you mentioned.
So this nice lady held you up and took the gold. Is that it?
It's like saying I was robbed at Sunday School.
No good, is it?
No.
Mick might've killed you.
But you fought him anyway.
Pete last night had a gun but that didn't scare you.
And now this gentile petticoat waves a gun and you run for your life.
You make it sound very silly.
Or make it sound like what it is.
A lie.
My word doesn't seem to be very good around here.
You've only got one thing that's very good around here.
Some gold.
- Is that all I've got?
- Not quite.
You got some time.
You got two hours to get it here.
And you want me to fatten you up before you have me killed.
- Is that what you mean?
- I said what I meant. Two hours.
You're sweet.
- Well?
- Everything's all set.
- Got enough men at the sawmill?
- Yeah, plenty.
Get back out there.
Get them into uniforms.
We hit the post just before dawn.
I don't know what we've waiting for?
I gave him some time.
He's in the hotel.
He's not doing anything.
I got him some time!
I don't care what he does with it.
- You want your IOU's?
- You mean...
- Why? Did Haven...?
- No, he didn't.
I don't understand.
We don't think they're going to be any good.
I haven't anything to do with it.
- I can still make the good or...
- What?
I can still do business.
Here. Take a look at this.
The deposition. The only copy.
- What do you want?
- Nothing.
All I want to do is get out of it.
I never had any part of it.
- This oughta prove it.
- This?
It's a trick.
I'll see about this.
Haven can't do this to me.
- I'll go and see this.
- Sure. You see about it.
Here, take this along.
Something left to wait for?
No.
- Who is it?
- It's me. Bristow. Let me in.
- Are you going to kill me, Mark?
- You double-crossed me, Haven.
- I did?
- I got the deposition back.
I took it to him.
It wasn't there.
It was just a piece of blank paper.
Don't you laugh at me or I'll kill you.
Well, they want you to, Mark.
And it may be your only out if you do.
But I doubt it.
You know why?
Because even if you took them my scalp, it wouldn't buy your life.
You're in debt. You're broke.
And you're scared.
And you know far too much.
There isn't any way they can use you alive.
Can you think of one?
They're going to do it. I know it.
They're gonna kill me.
Why do they have to kill me?
Us, Mark.
- This must be hers.
- Yes.
She's sweet.
One thing, Mark.
You might get out of town.
Not a chance in a thousand.
You'll do one in a million if it's the only one you have.
Yeah, I might get away with it.
I could try it.
If you do, go straight for your horse.
Don't stop for anything.
I have some important papers in the office.
You haven't anything important left except your life.
And very little time to keep it.
Get on the horse and ride him until he dies.
Then run until you have to crawl and you might be lucky.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, I'm naturally sentimental, being sort of a poet.
Naturally.
I keep a bunch of Jim Cracks.
An old-time sheriff's gun.
A bullet from a dead bandit.
And a rosary from some fellow they hung.
That's nice. A hobby?
Yeah, in a kind of way.
I just wondered if there was something that you wanted to leave me.
The only thing I have.
An army button. Where's the uniform that goes with it?
I might even know.
I think I'll go find out.
Where's your gun?
I dropped it back there.
All right, you, march.
Is that thing loaded?
You try your tricks and you'll find out.
No tricks, sheriff. No tricks.
Hey, go on back. Mick wants you.
What happened to you?
Haven slugged me.
Haven?
Keep him in here.
- Captain Iles.
- Don't apologize. Just barge right in.
- I'll tell you something.
- No, you're not. You're gonna listen.
You lost some uniforms.
You thought they were burned.
- They were burned.
- No, they weren't. But now I do.
But they are now because
I set fire to them.
What?
They are smoldering right now at the warehouse down at the sawmill
There are 70 men down there ready to wear them.
Wear them. What for?
What other reason except to get in this army post and take the gold from you?
Now you're about to send a detachment of men up north on an Indian scare?
- Yeah.
- That Indian scare is a fake.
It's a ruse.
You know where to send them now.
Guess I owe you an apology.
You better go down to the sawmill.
They might try it anyway.
I...
I guess also owe something too.
Only $50,000.
I wish there were something
I could say or do.
There is. You can give me back my gun.
I could give this one to the sheriff.
Tell him to be careful with it.
It's got bullets in it now.
I'll always remember what a fool I made of myself.
I'll always try to forget.
Are you going too?
Not with them.
You caused me an awful amount of trouble.
Yeah, but I finally brought you something.
You didn't think Mark would use that, did you?
Maybe I just wanted to send you a gun.
Maybe.
I have to arrest you.
- Why?
- Murder.
I could have shot just now and I didn't.
I didn't kill the two men or Goddard.
Who did?
Maybe Mick.
- Maybe Prince. Who knows?
- You know.
If you still have the gold, and I think you do, we might make a gift.
I believe every man has a price.
Some men don't believe that.
But woman knows it.
There wouldn't be any women on my jury.
And why you're not as bad off as you might think.
I could find a dozen men who might find you capable of almost anything, but I wouldn't bet they'd vote that way after staring at you through a trial.
Mick is dead for the murders.
Prince can hang for the rest of it.
Isn't it a little late to make any difference?
Maybe not.
Where is Prince?
It's no good.
I'll get someone.
Stay here.
Tell me on the square.
Did you ever love me?
From the first night, from the first time of song.
I tried to get away from it.
But every time, it came back.
Every time I tried it out of my brain,
I just pushed it deeper into my heart.
Say it.
I love you.
I love you.
See you... in China.
The sun shines warm on the dust of the prairie
The sun shining warm but it's heartless and cold it's heartless and cold in the dust of the prairie
And a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
A man can't grow old where there's women and gold.
Twice within one year,
the Dillinger mob struck at South Bend.
This time, the Fifth National Bank.
After brutally slugging the guards,
the armored truck was stolen.
Months later, it was dragged
from a nearby swamp...
...where the Dillinger mob
had dumped it.
Needless to add, it was empty.
Both bandits and money had vanished.
Then began the relentless chase
to apprehend these notorious criminals.
Dillinger's bloody trail
had led from Indiana...
...to the northwest woods
and back again to Indiana.
Ladies and gentlemen, you have just seen some of the highlights...
...during the span of John Dillinger's life of crime.
You will now hear from the man you have been waiting to see.
I'm John Dillinger's father.
John was born in 1903 on a farm...
...about 20 miles south of Indianapolis, Indiana.
He finished country school and went to high school for a while.
He played and worked and went swimming just like the other boys.
Looked like he'd marry one of the local girls and settle down...
...like all the folks who live in our parts.
But John couldn't seem to get used to doing the same thing...
...day in and day out.
One morning, he came down to breakfast all packed.
John wasn't the sort you could argue with...
...so I figured it'd be best to give him his head.
He didn't tell me much.
All he said, he was going to Indianapolis to become a big broker.
So I told him that little town wasn't big enough to hold me.
And nothing's going to stop me here either.
Look, the market is down.
Everybody's selling short.
But me, I'm buying.
- Honey, you're wonderful.
- You see, it's this way.
No matter how low public utilities go, they'll still be solid...
...because people always need electricity, gas and water.
- Honey, you're wonderful.
- Now you take the oil situation.
Do you know what it costs to drill a new well?
First, let's have another drink.
Mac, two more.
That'll be 2 bucks in advance.
Well, you heard the lady. Two more.
That'll be 2 bucks in advance.
Oh, pay him, honey.
We don't take checks.
- Say, what kind of a dump is this?
- Why, you two-bit chiseler.
- Let's get out of here.
- I want another drink.
- I wouldn't buy another drink in this dump.
- Oh, don't be that way, honey.
I want another drink. Please.
Okay, okay.
I'll be waiting for you.
I'll be right back.
- Yeah?
- I'd like to buy a pack of cigarettes.
- What kind do you want?
- What kind do you got?
Every kind.
This is a stickup. Open the register.
Give it here.
Only 7 dollars?
And 20 cents.
If you know what's good for you, you won't call the cops.
- Where's the fire?
- I didn't do nothing.
- What have you got there?
- Nothing.
Just a minute, let me see that.
- I didn't do nothing.
- Police, police, police!
He just robbed me.
Took my last 7 dollars and 20 cents.
You're cutting off the light.
- So what?
- So step aside.
Who's going to make me?
You, blinky?
Thank you.
I'll take that.
You heard me.
That wasn't very polite.
So what?
You crazy? You know who you took that potato from?
The smartest bank man in the country, Specs Green.
Have a smoke?
That's not my brand.
I'm sorry about the potato.
Forget it.
My name's John Dillinger.
- John who?
- Dillinger.
I'm in for a stickup.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I knocked off a joint.
Shot it out with the cops, but, you know, they had me 20 to one.
Fancy that.
- What are you in for?
- A stickup.
- How much did you get?
- Seventy thousand dollars.
Seventy thousand dollars?
- How much did you get?
- Oh, I got...
Lights out.
Seventy thousand dollars.
First society gets careless with the criminal...
...and then the criminal gets careless.
First guy to gum things up is the trigger-happy punk.
Personally, I have no use for a punk.
Some fellas, if you pat them on the back, they'll kill a man for you.
If you treat a punk right, you can get the biggest man in the world killed.
However, it's my opinion if a man kills a man, he should have a reason for it.
Hey, that's just what I think, Mr. Green.
Good boy, John.
Come here.
Gentlemen, I want you to meet my cellmate, Mr. Dillinger.
John, this is Mr. Minelli,
Doc Madison, Mr. Kirk.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hiya. I've been looking forward to meeting you guys.
- What's on your mind?
- Well, this is the way I look at it, fellas.
If the five of us put our heads together, we can go places. Big places.
Unfortunately, the four of us are not going anyplace for a long time.
As soon as I get out, I'll spring you.
All of you.
Mr. Dillinger has very enthusiastic ideas.
You can count on me, fellas.
Run along, John. I'll see you later.
You heard me.
- Fresh punk.
- He'll learn.
The hard way.
I think the kid has possibilities.
I tell you, my ideas will work.
Together we can make the rest of the mobs look sick.
I'll be out in six months.
The first thing I'll do is spring you.
Just two more months, fellas, and I'll show you the way.
Sleeping, John?
Just thinking.
This time next week you'll be as free as a bird.
Yeah.
- How are you feeling?
- Swell.
You're not talkative anymore, are you?
You always said I talked too much.
Good boy.
Hey, what have you got there?
A present from Mom and Pop.
- Oh, I didn't know you had any folks.
- They aren't really my folks.
Whenever I got in a jam, I used to go up to their mountain lodge till things cooled off.
- Can you trust them?
- Sure.
They know they'd better treat me like their own son...
...or something awful might happen to them.
Oh, grapes.
I love grapes.
You're wanted downstairs, Dillinger.
Well, John, I guess this is it. Good luck.
Thanks a lot for everything.
Have a good time at Amel's golden wedding anniversary.
Come on.
All the best, kid.
- What time does the feature go on?
- In 10 minutes.
- Is it a good picture?
- We always show good pictures.
Can I get a seat right away?
It's not crowded till the next show.
Good.
- Enjoy the show?
- Fine.
Pretty crowded inside now.
I'll take that.
Give me the rest. I'm not fooling.
No.
- Recognize him?
- Yes, that's him.
- You sure?
- Positive.
But yesterday you were positive.
Well, I made a mistake.
But you seemed so sure.
I was just excited.
Is that the only reason?
I'm positive that isn't the man.
- You haven't said a word all night.
- I know.
You haven't even told me your name.
- Helen Rogers.
- John Dillinger.
Well, that didn't hurt so much, did it?
I still don't know why I came with you.
Same reason why you didn't turn me in.
You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?
In my business, you have to be.
Just what is your business?
"Associations made on this day will be highly profitable and lasting."
"Dear Specs, just a line to let you know
I haven't forgotten.
I ran into an old friend tonight who owed me some money, and he paid off pronto.
We're having a surprise party on September the 26th...
...to celebrate Amel's golden wedding anniversary.
Sure wish you and the gang were here.
Well, that's all for now.
As ever, John."
Just think,
Amel's golden wedding anniversary.
September 26th, huh?
- That's a good day.
- Yeah.
Maybe we'll make it.
- What can I do for you?
- Like to buy a barrel of cement.
I'm sorry, but we only sell wholesale.
I'm doing a little home gardening.
I'd like to buy one barrel for my lily pond.
I'm sorry, it's company policy.
I don't make the rules.
I'd like to help you, but...
But...
But...
Well, we occasionally accommodate somebody...
...who might make a good customer.
Where do you want it sent?
- I'll take it with me. Give me a hand.
- Sure.
The white cross.
White cross.
The white cross.
- Where'd this truck come from?
- I never saw it before.
Hey, come here and get a load of this.
- Holy smoke.
- Looks we got here just in time.
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's take it back.
Oh, boy, what'll they think of stealing next?
- Come on, give me a hand with this thing.
- Okay.
What a guy will go through to steal a barrel of cement.
You two guys get those tools over there.
Today's the 26th. Nothing's happened.
- I told you he was a phony. I told you.
- Shut up.
The white cross.
We gotta watch for a white cross.
There ain't no white cross.
All we got is a double-cross.
Your pal, huh?
- What are we going to do?
- Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.
Hey, heads up down there!
Why don't you eat?
- Who can eat?
- It ain't bad.
Why you keep looking at the sun all the time for?
- There isn't much more time.
- I told you, I told you.
- It's all yours, Max.
- Okay.
Unload it, boys.
Hey!
Pick that shovel up and put it down right.
Yes, sir.
Kirk, Doc, get up there.
This is it.
We'll take it up again.
What did you put that barrel back for?
All right, boys.
Calling all cars, calling all cars, be on the lookout for a black sedan.
Bandits heavily armed.
They got us pegged. They got us.
- It was bound to happen.
- We're pulling too many jobs.
That's it, we're pulling too many jobs.
It was that assistant cashier.
He spotted us.
I could have taken care of him, if you hadn't stopped me.
You're a little too free with the gun, John.
That's a matter of opinion.
Around here my opinion is the only one that counts.
Any objections?
Satisfied?
Now, our next job is the Farmers National.
Farmers National? You nuts?
- That's pretty tough.
- It's full of guards. You can't get near it.
It's around the corner from the joint we cracked yesterday.
That's just why I picked it.
They'll never expect lightning to strike twice.
That's great thinking, Specs.
Yeah. Yeah.
Now, one of us has got to case the bank, you understand?
Since the four of us have been identified...
...it's expedient for us to keep out of sight as much as possible.
So that more or less throws it in your lap, John.
Smile, John.
That's better.
Well, there's nothing further we can do until John returns with his report.
So let's relax.
- How about a little game?
- Table stakes?
- Okay by me.
- Deal up.
- Deal you in, John?
- Not tonight.
- Where you going?
- Out.
Be careful.
Why? Nobody's looking for me.
I told you he was a fresh punk.
Well, he'll learn.
Where you going, honey?
If you'd have been another minute,
I'd have been gone.
Where are we going?
Oh, there's a little place on the other side of town I'd like to visit again.
- Why did you pick this place?
- Oh, I was here once before.
- What happened?
- Oh, I left some unfinished business.
Yeah, what'll it be?
Remember me?
No.
Three beers.
That'll be 6 bits.
I don't think I can change this, sir.
That's all right. Keep it.
Thank you, sir.
- Why three beers?
- We're gonna have company.
I don't see anyone.
You will.
- Who gets this one?
- You.
- Me?
- Sure, come on, sit down, join us.
Many happy returns.
Wait in the car.
I said, wait in the car.
Well, here's looking at you.
You don't remember me, do you?
- No, sir.
- I was in here a long time ago.
Couldn't pay for a couple of drinks.
You wouldn't cash my check.
You called me a two-bit chiseler.
Mr. Graham, a gentleman wants to see you.
Have a chair.
Well, young man, what can I do for you?
- Well, I'd like to get a little information.
- Oh, I see.
This pamphlet will give you a statement...
...of our financial condition as of the last fiscal year.
Well, I was thinking of opening an account.
Oh. Oh, I see.
Well, you can rest assured that your money will be perfectly safe here.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
You see, I've got a big deposit to make...
...and with all these bank robberies...
- We've never been robbed.
- Now, believe me, Mr...?
- Peters. Walter Peters.
Oh, yes, Mr. Peters.
Believe me, your money will be absolutely safe in this bank.
Come, let me show you around.
You see, Mr. Peters, these windows are all constructed of bulletproof glass.
They extend to the bottom of the cage.
All monies must be slid in and out through the groove.
This makes it impossible for a thief on the outside...
...to point a gun at a teller on the inside.
- That's a good idea.
- And as an added precaution...
...there's a button at the foot of each teller.
These buttons close the front door...
...sealing off the only avenue of escape.
They're also connected with the police department.
Within two minutes, the bank will be entirely surrounded.
Hey, that's a good idea too.
Now I'd like to show you the vault.
No threat of any kind from the outside could force that door open...
...because we installed the latest tear-gas unit.
In addition to the automatic burglar alarm, we have a large number of armed guards...
...all of whom, incidentally, are pretty good marksmen.
So you see, Mr. Peters, the bank is absolutely impregnable.
Yep, you got quite a little place here.
Now, do you want to open a checking or a savings account?
I don't know yet. I'd like to bring the missus around tomorrow.
Very well, then. Until tomorrow.
- Quit eating them grapes.
- There's no use arguing about it.
I've thought this over a long time.
That's the way I see it.
- It's suicide, that's what it is.
- Shut up!
A shipment of $80,000 in cash arriving at the Farmers National Bank tomorrow.
- We can't afford to pass it up.
- You heard what John said.
Will you shut up?
- Was there a back door?
- No.
The alarm system operates on electricity, doesn't it?
Of course.
I thought of cutting the main cable, but it would operate on the battery system.
- Maybe we better pass it up.
- No, there must be some way.
I guess we'll have to get some outside help.
See if anybody's using the telephone.
- It's okay.
- Fine, thanks.
Hello. Hello, Louie? This is Specs, Louie.
Now, listen, I'm doing a big construction job tomorrow...
...and I can use three of your men.
Yeah, the usual rate.
No, no, no, I'll call you back.
- That's the way I see it.
- That's swell.
- It's a beauty.
- Gotta hand it to you, John.
What have you there?
Just my plan of how to crack the Farmers National.
May I see it, John?
You talk too much.
You use a gun too much.
And now you're thinking too much.
You shouldn't be so hasty, Specs.
John's idea wasn't so bad.
You better take a look at it.
Stand back.
Hold it a second.
It's Marco.
We better get out of here.
- Where did you ditch the car?
- In the parking lot, like John told me.
All right, Marco.
Doc.
All right, Kirk.
This is for you, John.
I'll take that.
But I always take a double cut.
Not anymore.
Well, we did use John's plan.
All right, John, if that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.
Why are we waiting?
Let's get out of here.
Split up. We'll meet in 30 days at Fox Creek.
- Otto's place.
- All right.
Marco, you go first.
Kirk, you take the back stairs.
You take the basement.
And you go out the fire escape.
- How are you leaving?
- I'm going out the front door.
Only 8000.
Does monsieur wish to charge?
No, I'll pay cash for it.
Thank you, thank you very much.
- Who lives here?
- What do you care?
- Well, I just like to know where I am.
- You're with me.
We are closed for the winter.
It's okay, Pop. How are you, John?
Glad to see you.
Come on in.
Oh, how do you do?
And the girl said to the sailor...
- This is Helen.
- Hello.
- Hiya.
- Hello there.
Well, stand up when you meet a lady.
This is Specs, that's Doc,
Marco, and that's Kirk.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Well, how about a couple of chairs?
- Won't you take your coat off?
- Thanks.
- She's nice, isn't she?
- Call her Mom.
I call that guy Pop.
Hey, Pop, fill them up, will you?
Just one big happy family.
I tell you, I'm going nuts around here,
I tell you.
Relax, will you? Relax.
Who can relax? How can a man sleep nights? Them crickets.
Why don't you complain to John?
He'll knock them off for you.
How long are we gonna stay here?
It seems I'm not giving orders around here anymore.
John's got something up his sleeve.
You can bet on that.
Whatever John says, it's okay with me.
But it's them crickets that got me down.
Them crickets. All night long, them crickets.
- Where's John?
- What's up?
Where's John?
Cops in the village. John.
Two cars full of them. They are asking questions all over the village.
I told you guys never to come here.
Marco, get the cars.
Get packed. Watch the highway.
- Where are we going?
- West.
John, I don't think we ought to do this.
I don't care what you think.
Looks like the Dillinger mob has come West.
Oh, this toothache's murder.
- Probably abscessed.
- You don't eat the right kind of food.
Here, take a swig of this.
You ought to see a dentist.
- That'll hurt more.
- Oh, it's killing me.
- It won't go away by itself.
- Specs is right.
- You should see a dentist.
- All right, all right.
Yeah, but you gotta find one you can trust.
You can't trust any of them. Once you open your mouth, you're through.
- How do you do?
- My name is Robbins...
...and I called for an appointment.
- Yes, Mr. Robbins.
Dr. Stanley will see you now.
Mr. Robbins, sit down.
Ready, doctor.
Now, what seems to be the trouble?
I got a bad tooth.
Open wide, please.
It certainly is a bad tooth.
It'll have to come out.
- Will it hurt much?
- I'm afraid so.
You have an impacted wisdom tooth.
- Maybe I better come back.
- I'll give you an anesthetic.
You won't feel a thing.
Okay, you're the doctor.
- Hey, wait a second, doc.
- Yes.
- Is that stuff dangerous?
- Oh, I give it to children.
All right, now. Now breathe deeply.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Extra! Paper! Dillinger captured.
Read all about it.
Extra! Dillinger captured.
Extra! Paper! Dillinger captured.
Read all about it here.
Dillinger captured. Extra! Paper!
Dillinger captured. Read all about it.
Extra! Paper! Dillinger captured.
Read about it.
Extra! Paper! Extra here!
Extra! Dillinger captured.
What do you got to say now, Dillinger?
No tag town jail can hold me.
I'll be out before a month.
How are you doing?
Good evening, Mr. Dillinger.
- Don't you ever get tired of whittling, Jack?
- You gotta do something.
Time sure passes slow in here.
- What are you making now?
- A boat.
One of the guards wanted one for his little boy.
He promised me 50 cents.
Is it hard to learn?
Well, Mr. Dillinger, you don't need no 50 cents.
- Hey, Jack.
- Yes, sir.
I'll give you a dollar for that knife and piece of wood.
Sold.
Thank you, sir.
Going someplace?
Yeah.
- Well, have a good time.
- Thanks.
Hey, guard, guard.
Oh, guard, guard.
- What are you hollering about?
- Stick them up.
Stick them up.
Open up.
Open up, or I'll blow your brains out.
Get in there.
Get in there.
Mr. Dillinger.
My boat done turned it into a gun.
So long, Jack.
This is Tony.
Glad to meet you, Mr. Dillinger.
Keep both hands on the wheel.
Who is he?
Well, when you were picked up,
Specs felt he needed an extra man.
So I felt we needed an extra man.
Tony's a good boy.
I've got nothing against Tony.
Well, I'm glad you feel that way,
John, old boy. I'm glad you feel that way.
We were just wondering, all of us here, and talking about how you'd get out.
- Yeah, how'd you do it, John?
- Who sprung you?
What's the idea?
What's the matter with you, John?
Now, wait a minute, John.
Wait a minute.
You gotta listen to me before you do anything.
I didn't turn you in.
I didn't send those cops to that dentist.
I never knew anything about it.
You gotta believe me, John.
You gotta believe me.
Sure, I believe you, Specs.
Sure.
Why, it's wood.
It's wood.
Look, fellas.
It's wood.
John broke jail with a wooden gun.
John, you're always kidding.
We're pals again, John, huh?
Sure, Specs, just pals.
Say, what's the matter with your friend?
I don't see him anymore.
Who's that?
You know, the one with the glass. Specs.
He had an accident.
Oh, that's too bad.
He was hurt much?
Eddie, Vito, Dutch, Specs.
Pretty soon I have no more customers.
Did you see Helen?
Look, John, we gotta get some dough but quick.
What happens to the money we get?
When you're hiding out, everything costs triple.
You spent it pretty easy while I was away.
- We had to do something to kill the time.
- What's the difference? We're broke.
- What's next, John?
- We're too hot. We gotta pull one big job.
- Where?
- The First National.
- First National, are you crazy?
- Count me out.
I wouldn't go within a mile of the place.
- We're not gonna.
- Oh, I see.
We'll get it outside the bank, like we did before?
Oh, they'll never fall for that again.
I wouldn't go within 10 miles of the place.
- We won't go within 100 miles of it.
- That sounds good.
A shipment of $300,000 is coming to First National from the Treasury.
Treasury? Are we going to rob the Treasury?
- Let John talk.
- We can't crack the bank.
We can't tackle the armored car again.
The Treasury's an arsenal.
But between the Treasury and the armored car, where's the money?
- On the train.
- That's it.
The mail train? Look, John, that's...
That's fooling with the government.
- What are we gonna do? Rot here?
- Yeah, but the government.
I haven't led you wrong yet, have I?
It's not gonna be easy, but it's worth it.
Three hundred grand.
We split it even this time.
That's $60,000 apiece.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Hi.
Forget it for tonight. Let's eat.
Beat it.
- What took you so long?
- We took in a show.
- Why?
- I was just wondering.
What's the matter?
You're not jealous of Tony, are you?
No. Tony's a good boy.
Don't talk to anybody on the train.
What do you take me for, a dummy?
- That sure was a heavy suitcase.
- Yeah, books.
Thank you, sir.
- Drop me at the next station.
- Yeah.
- When the train pulls out, keep up with it.
- Yeah.
Conductor.
- What's the matter?
- I feel sick.
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I wish you would.
- There, feel better now?
- Yes, thanks very much.
Sit down, everybody.
Sit down.
Let's get going. Hurry up, jump for it.
Go on, go on.
- There were too many of them.
- Take it easy, John.
We gotta get him to a doctor.
I'm all right. Drive straight to Otto's.
We can't go there.
Kirk took his chances like the rest of us.
Drive straight to Otto's.
- today onboard the crack express,
Silver Lark.
As a result, John Dillinger, public enemy number one...
...or rather public disgrace number one...
...has become the center
of the biggest manhunt of the decade.
The FBI has ordered an all-out search
to track down the Dillinger mob...
...who are responsible
for this brutal crime.
Dillinger is believed
to have been wounded.
One of the bandits who was slain has
been identified by the police as Kirk Otto.
Two mail clerks, though caught in the blast
of machine guns, stood by their posts.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Otto.
Maybe it's better that way.
- What are you looking for, Papa?
- My pipe.
I'll get it for you.
Take it easy, John. Don't worry.
- Don't worry about it.
- You'll be all right.
Hide the car, Tony.
I'll boil some water.
I'll go see what Tony did with the car.
I better help Helen.
What are you looking at me for?
The police, they're all around.
They're searching everyplace.
Get your things. I'll get the car.
You meet me by the sign.
Where's Tony?
First Specs, then Kirk. We're next.
Dillinger and these big plans.
I know a lot of places in the city.
Now, we can't leave until John gives the word.
- Who says we can't?
- There's only one car.
Well, two can travel safer than five.
John Dillinger and your men. We have this house completely surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
You've got one minute.
Just one minute.
John Dillinger, you've 30 seconds left.
Thirty seconds.
Five seconds.
Time's up.
- Who is it?
- Helen.
Did you get it?
- It's cold in here.
- Yeah.
There's something wrong with the radiator.
Have you been out today?
No.
- Why don't you take that down?
- I like it there.
Let's go out, John.
I can't.
It's Christmas Eve.
No one will be looking for you.
I can't.
Well, I'm not staying in.
I want to go out.
I want to have some fun.
Go on, go out.
Have yourself a good time.
Go ahead.
Merry Christmas, John.
What are you doing out?
- Where have you been all week?
- Looking for a job.
- You mean you're...?
- Broke, flat, busted.
Of course, I can always sling hash.
You're not slinging hash for no one.
That's the way I like to hear you talk, John.
As soon as the heat cools off,
I'll be back in the chips.
I'll get a new mob together, bigger than before.
I'll get guys with nerve, plenty of guts like myself.
Yeah, that's what.
Of course, I'll have to be careful.
I can't do nothing now.
Maybe next year.
Yeah, next year ought to be fine.
Well, what are we waiting for?
- Catch.
- There it is.
I was hoping we'd go someplace today.
- I've only got a few dollars left.
- Well, who cares?
Guess I had you figured wrong.
- What do you mean?
- Well...
- Where are we going?
- I don't care.
- Let's go somewhere. Anywhere.
- Let's go to a movie.
- Any particular one?
- I'd like to go to the Biograph.
Fine.
Hey, you got a new dress, huh?
You look good in red.
- How many, please?
- Two, please.
Thank you.
You can reach me now at Fox Lake 287.
Put it through as soon as it comes.
- Is that your girl?
- Yeah.
I've got a sweetheart too.
He's 6 foot tall, dark wavy hair,
and very handsome.
Everybody says
he ought to be in the movies.
All the girls are crazy about him,
but he loves only me.
And I can twist him
around my little finger.
You're a liar, Julie.
If he heard you talk to me like that,
he'd give you a terrible beating.
You're an awful liar, Julie.
Watch for the woman in red.
My hero.
They've been in there two hours.
Show must be about over.
What's his name?
That's the funny part.
We don't even know what he looks like.
This is where we came in.
- I'll take another bourbon.
- Sure.
- You ever been in San Francisco?
- No.
Smart fella. Stick in your own hometown
and stay out of trouble.
You fellas sure you got the right place?
This is Route 21, isn't it?
Be on the alert, fellas.
I think I'll get some candy.
Articles.
One nickel-plated watch...
...a wallet...
...7 dollars and 20 cents.
Here come somebody.
That must be Bill Doolin.
That ain't Doolin, he couldn't ride like that if you tied him on.
Morning boys.
Well, what's the matter? Didn't you've yet see a girl before?
- Who are you?
- Name Cheyenne.
Bill Doolin sent me, he's my uncle.
Been riding since 2 this morning... so I'll answer any other questions over a cup of coffee.
- I've heard Bill speak of you.
- Thanks.
- But I thought you were just a little kid.
- Well, I was once.
I'm John younger, this my brother Jim, that's Cole back there.
You're Billy the kid, you must be Yeager... and the Sundance Kid, uncle Bill told me about you.
What's Bill got on his mind?
He didn't explain nothing in his letter.
Oh, he will when you see him. Right now, he's got his eye on a little bank in Braxton.
That's why he sent me instead of coming himself.
You mean we rode all the way out here just to knock over a small town bank?
Is only the beginning, the whole new territory he's after.
Right now, we want to get this bank for a stake before it moves.
We've been watching, everybody is closing out their accounts, chucked full of cash.
- Wait a minute, you've said we.
- That's right, any objections?
Yeah, busting banks is men's work.
- Belle Starr did all right.
- You ain't Belle Starr.
Suppose you make your complaints to uncle Bill.
- Did he figure you in on this?
- Of course, we got it all worked out.
Is all right with
Doolin is all right with us.
- This is his show Sundance.
- Let's go then, all that's going.
Would be a pleasure.
What's all the commotion down there Cheyenne?
All the ranchers have to move out too, that place belongs to a man named Vance Cordell.
Read in the paper where he's having an auction.
Vance Cordell, I know that name.
Uncle Bill said he used to be a Texas ranger.
- That's it, now I remember.
- A friend of yours?
Not exactly.
This is your only legal chance to steal this herd of cattle here from Mr. Vance Cordell.
And is burglary my friends, highway robbery and you can do it without using a gun.
All right now, what am I offered for this herd of cattle here?
The finest cattle, the finest herd north of the panhandle.
All right, what am I offered? What am I offered?
Oh, don't stand out there with blank faces, say something.
What am I offered here?
How much will you give me a head?
16 dollars.
16 dollars, that's kind of a weak start brother but at least is a start anyway.
All right, 16 I've got, do I hear 20?
We better get away from here before he talks me into bidding on my own cattle.
Well, if he gets them up to 25 dollars a head I'll be satisfied.
- Will you?
- Sure, that's a fair enough price.
I don't mean that Vance. I mean will you be satisfied living away from here?
You know what you are Madge? You're a worrier.
Well, it's worth worrying about to be sure we're right.
Yeah.
I don't want to get off to California and then feel you only did it to please me.
Look... we're not just kids at our first picnic, we're old enough to know our own minds.
You just stick to that promise to marry me and I'll be happy to live anywhere.
Dad says I act more like a scared old maid than a widow with a growing son.
- Maybe he's right.
- Well?
All I know is that I want my boy Johnny to grow up in a peaceful, orderly country.
You've got that coming.
Only I'm afraid no country will stay peaceful long after Johnny gets there.
- Oh, Vance.
- Now, that's more like it.
I think you better go on back to town before your Dad gives his bank away.
- I'll meet you later when this is all over.
- All right.
Grey Eagle, round up Johnny and tell him his mother is ready to leave.
Yes.
What you going to do when
Mr. Cordell leaves Grey Eagle?
I don't know, maybe I come to California.
All right, 19 I've got. Who shall up?
Lady don't stand too close to that wheel, the team is liable to back up there on you.
- 19 I've got, who'll give me 20?
- I'll make it 20.
Oh, you better hurry Johnny or your mother will leave you.
No, she won't.
But I got to say this to you...
That while I've been standing here talking to you my friends...
Vance, if you're in town tonight drop in for supper.
Fine, I will if I can make it.
Ain't you going to kiss her like you do when I'm not around?
Johnny.
You know Johnny, that's a very good idea.
- Giddy up, boy.
- Goodbye.
But Madge, a bank is a place to put money in and take it out, ain't it?
- Well, I want to take some out.
- But Muley, you're not a depositor.
Fumbeydiddles, your Pa is
President of the bank, ain't he?
He runs it, don't he?
Well, that's got nothing to do it.
There are certain rules...
- The president makes the rules, don't he?
- Yes, but...
- Well, I want to see the president then.
- Very well.
You stay right there, I'll see if he's busy.
I can wait till he ain't.
Well, make it quick daughter,
I got to go meet the train.
Wait a minute Dad, Muley Wilson is outside, he wants to borrow money.
I told him he couldn't possibly make a loan without proper collateral but he won't listen.
No collateral, you done absolutely right, this here institution is a bank.
It's going to be run like one.
Bring him in here, I'll tell him.
Will you come in please?
What's the matter with you Muley? Run around trying to borrow money without collateral?
Well, Mr...
You better go back to your cashier's cage daughter.
Muley... don't you know that a bank is an institution that'll lend money to a man... only upon his furnishing absolute proof that he don't need to borrow it in the first place?
- How much you want?
- I kind of need about 300 John.
What do you want it for?
Well, I got to buy me a new wagon and some farming implements so I can make the run.
- How long have I known you Muley?
- About 3 years.
Well, here's 100 dollars for every year I've known you.
- You can have it on one condition.
- Anything you say Mr. President.
See to it that you settle in Guthrie.
If I catch you making eyes towards Oklahoma city...
I'll shoot you down like I would a local coyote.
Guthrie is my first love John, you're my second.
Your daughter kind of had me worried for a minute there.
Oh, Madge got a lot of newfangled notions about... bookkeeping, chattel mortgages and promissory notes, she'll get over it in time.
You know Muley... there ain't much point in writing things down in books... when most of the people you do business with can't write themselves.
All right, come on, get out of here now.
Hurry up, hurry up, get out, go on, go on.
The nerve of that Muley Wilson.
I guess I told him a thing or two.
Well, where's Johnny? If he's going to ride shotgun with me, he'd better hustle.
- He's waiting for you in the buckboard.
- Oh, yeah.
- Did you give him bills or coins?
- Bills.
- Sorry to keep you waiting Johnny.
- That's all right Grandpa.
- Is your gun loaded?
- Sure is.
- Yes sirree, you keep your eyes open now.
- You bet I will.
Giddy up boy.
Speaking of ice cream Johnny, did I ever tell you about the time that I...
We weren't speaking about ice cream Grandpa.
Well, you just said ice cream, didn't you?
- No, you did.
- All right, somebody did.
So speaking of ice cream, did I ever tell you about the time I drove 26 miles... to Lawrence, Kansas, in the blistering heat just to get a freezer full of ice cream... for your grandma when we was courting, eh?
The ice cream would've melted if it was blistering hot Grandpa.
Melted?
Why Johnny, the weather was so changeable in Kansas... before I got halfway back to the house... it blowed up a blizzard and
I darn near froze to death, yes sir.
I'd have froze stiffer than an injun's upper lip, except for one thing that saved my life.
Well...
Ain't you going to ask me what the one thing was that saved my life?
It was probably so much colder than ice cream Grandpa... you just snuggled up close to freezer, kept warm.
You don't lay out young feller, you're going to grow up to be just like your ma.
Giddy up, Mary.
Here she comes fellas, let's go down and watch her come in.
- Now you keep your eyes open Johnny.
- Sure will Grandpa.
Leslie, I have come for a certain express package, about so long, about so wide.
It's from a certain bank in Kansas to a certain bank right here in town.
I know just where it is.
Hey Joe, give me the package for the Bank of Braxton..
All ready for you.
- Sign here John.
- Yeah.
Much obliged boys.
- A lot of money in there Johnny.
- That's all right Grandpa.
- I'll protect it.
- Yeah, giddy up boy.
- What do you want?
- I'll take that first.
Now put your hands down and walk into that closet.
I'd like a ticket to St. Joe please.
St. Joe?
Got to work fast uncle Bill, they're on our trail..
- Posse?
- Army.
That'll be 12.60 dollars, please.
You know, you gents are in one of the most conservative banks in the territory.
Yes, sirree Bob.
And if you're going to settle near Guthrie... you won't make no mistake banking with John J. Pettit.
We take it in fast, pay it out just as fast when you want it.
Ask any of our depositors.
Why, we paid out 10,000 today.
We'll pay out twice that much tomorrow before we close up for good.
Yes, sirree Bob.
- 290, 295, $300, there you are Mrs. Moore.
- Thank you Madge.
Remember now, as soon as your father comes out of the... meeting with those cattlemen tell him I was here.
Be happy to.
And tell him I'll see him in Guthrie just as soon as he gets his bank started there.
I will Mrs. Moore.
Got a telegram here for the Bank of Braxton.
Oh, I'll take it.
You're new here, aren't you?
Well, this is my first job in the territory, if that's what you mean.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt Dad but I think you ought to see this.
What is it daughter?
Very interesting.
Listen to this gents.
Says we can expect a visit from some of the country's leading outlaws.
Billy the kid, the
Younger brothers, George Mason... and the Sundance kid.
Well, let them come, we're ready for them.
They won't get nothing around here but the worst of it.
That kind of talk sure impresses us Mr. Pettit.
- So you're ready for the outlaws?
- You're darn tooting.
See that rope?
Runs right on up through the ceiling to a bell, you can hear it all over town.
Means grab your guns and come a-running because a bank is being robbed.
Thanks Mr. Pettit, that's all we wanted to know.
You ain't the fellers
I was talking about, are you?
You catch on fast.
You two be quiet and nobody will get hurt.
Mason, keep your eye on them, let's go.
You're the most unethical, ornery bandits I ever done business with.
Everything is working out just like you said Bill.
Good, you all know what to do, get at it.
Get them up and be quiet.
- Hey, do we put our hands down?
- Sure, if you want to get shot.
Hey folks, that's the bell of the bank that's ringing.
Somebody is robbing the bank, come on.
- Here they come.
- Let's go.
Mason, come on.
- Come on Cheyenne.
- I'll be right with you.
- Where do you think you're going?
- To the...
Back to my office.
- Place looks pretty deserted, doesn't it?
- Yes, pretty lonesome.
Grey Eagle.
Take my horse, go into town and get
Doc green, we need him here quick.
All right, hold it cowboy.
- You'd better get back to bed.
- I mean what I said, stay where you are.
Now, take off your gun belt.
- Hurry up cowboy.
- Don't rush me.
Stop calling me cowboy,
I'm a retired rancher.
You'll be retired for keeps if you try anything funny.
Why should I?
You know, it's kind of unusual finding a girl riding around with a bullet hole in her arm.
Never mind about that, now kick the gun over here.
You'd better wait until the doctor gets here if you know what's good for you.
Turn around.
- You got a funny way of saying thanks.
- I said turn...
Come on Dad, you might as well lock up and go home.
Ain't nothing left to lock up.
Dad-blame bandits took everything but the cuckoo clock.
If that Vance Cordell would've been here they wouldn't have done it.
Vance said he might stop in for supper if nothing important detained him.
Supper? Well come on, let's go.
Doc, Doc...
- Yeah.
- How is she?
Oh, nothing dangerous, unless complications set in which isn't likely.
Grey eagle will give you some breakfast and take you into town.
- You need some sleep.
- All right, if you need me send for me.
Thanks for coming over Doc.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye Doc.
Good morning Cheyenne, how do you feel?
- You know my name?
- Doc green told me.
The whole territory is buzzing about that holdup.
So you're Bill Doolin's niece.
Did they, did they get uncle Bill?
Not that slippery old codger.
- Kind of fond of him, aren't you?
- Yes, and I'm proud of it.
Don't supposed you'd understand about things like that.
Why not? I know Bill.
- You do?
- Every peace officer in the Southwest does.
As a matter fact, I could've liked him if we hadn't been on opposite sides of the fence.
I can't say I like the way he brought up his relatives, though.
I do.
- How old are you?
- None of your business.
You know, I think the best medicine for you would be an old fashion spanking.
It might jar some of those crazy smart-aleck ideas out of your head.
You wouldn't dare.
Look kid, there's nothing smart about being outside the law. It just means you haven't... got the brains and the courage to keep in step with the rest of the people.
- Well, we did all right yesterday.
- Sure, you did great.
You got a little quick money and a bullet hole in your arm.
Next time, you'll pick up a little more gold and a little more lead.
And pretty soon, if you play your cards right... you can be one of the richest outlaws buried on boot hill.
- Well, that's a chance you take.
- That's right, maybe you won't get killed.
Maybe you'll live as long as your uncle and the way he does... half the time in jail and the other half in some dismal hideout.
That's a fine way for a young girl to spend her life.
- I suppose you know a better way.
- Women have been known to work.
I can just see myself waiting tables 6 days a week.
Some women even get married and raise families.
If they're not too busy robbing banks, of course.
Look mister, break up the prayer meeting.
It's already broken up. Here comes the posse.
What you going to do?
Go see them of course. You might as well relax, there are no more guns around.
- What's the trouble Ed?
- We're looking for a girl outlaw.
Part of a gang that robbed the Bank at Braxton.
She was headed this way but we lost her trail.
- She's carrying a lot of valuable bonds.
- I'll keep my eyes open.
If you see her don't take no chances just because she's a girl.
- She's tough as nails.
- I'll be careful.
Good.
- Boys let's water up before we move on.
- Help yourselves.
Thanks, Vance.
- Well, why didn't you turn me in?
- I got a better idea.
I'm going to let you turn yourself in.
You'll get off a lot easier.
Thanks.
- How is your arm?
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
It'll have plenty of time to heal in jail.
Looks deserted all right, maybe she is hid out down there.
- Maybe it's a trap.
- You know, there's only one way to find out.
Hey Sundance, look who found outside, all saddled up and getting ready to leave.
- But he said Cheyenne hasn't been here.
- He's a liar, take a look at that.
Come on, let's hear about it.
You heard him, talk.
- Where is that girl?
- Take it easy Sundance.
- She has been here, hasn't she?
- Yes, but she go away.
She go away with Cordell?
They must've gone back to Braxton.
We got to catch him before he turns those bonds in.
- And Cheyenne along with them.
- Where is she?
Let's get out of here.
We're going to get nothing out of him.
I'll get something out of him.
- You go along, I'll catch up with you.
- Come on Billy.
No, no.
I'm leaving at the top of the next hill.
Braxton is just on the other side.
You mean you trust me to go up the rest of the way alone and with these?
I've got your word, haven't I?
Suppose after you leave me
I decide to make a break for it?
- I don't think you will.
- But suppose I do.
- I'll go after you and bring you back.
- That's what I thought.
Used to be a pretty good cowhand.
Take it easy fella and you won't get hurt.
- Hello Vance.
- Hello Cole.
Like old home week, isn't it?
Sort of so... except that things have changed a little this time, take his gun kid.
- Cheyenne, you got the bonds?
- Right here.
Too bad mister, all that good preaching gone to waste.
Still makes sense.
Better think it over before you make another mistake.
You almost convinced me a couple of times.
- But I guess I'll never know how...
- What is all this?
Just a little discussion we were having.
Any more gab out of you and you'll be deader than that Indian of yours.
- Why, you...
- Easy Cordell.
Sundance, your mouth is too big.
What's he going to do about it?
Get rid of your gun or give me one and I'll show you.
Sure, I'll give you a gun.
Let's get out of here.
- Hurry up Billy, let's go.
- No, I think I'll check out about here.
What's eating you?
You, I don't like the way you operate.
You're getting kind of particular, ain't you?
I always was, that's why I'm pulling out now.
Well, if you want to be a lone wolf nobody is going to stop you.
That's right, nobody is going to stop me.
- Like to come along Cheyenne?
- Thanks Kid, I'll stick with uncle Bill.
I wouldn't try that if I were you.
He got eyes in the back of his head.
You know, with Mason getting killed in the Braxton holdup... and Billy the kid running out on us our cut's getting bigger and bigger.
Yeah, well don't worry about it.
Billy is still going to get his share.
- Mason won't.
- Wonder if Mason had a wife.
It ain't likely.
Some women even get married and raise families.
If they're not too busy robbing banks, of course.
You know, Doolin sure picked himself a hideout.
You can spend the rest of your life here and nobody would find you.
I wouldn't mind that.
Plenty of liquor and...
The right kind of entertainment.
I hope we get there before dark.
Half the time in jail and the other half in some dismal hideout.
That's a fine way for a young girl to spend her life.
Hold it boys, get down off those horses..
What's the matter with you? You gone loco?
- I've just come to my senses, that's all.
- Take it easy.
Try that again, I'll put one right between your eyes.
Now turn around and give me your guns.
- I don't get it Cheyenne.
- I do, she's double-crossing us.
That money won't do you any good.
We'll find you wherever you go.
That will be easy, just look in the nearest jail.
- You're going to give yourself up?
- That's right.
Tell uncle Bill I'm sorry, but, well, maybe he'll understand.
- I'll remember this too.
- All right, you remember and I'll forget.
That's a great bunch those friends of yours.
Grey eagle wasn't even carrying a gun.
I'm awfully sorry... but they're not my friends anymore.
- What made you change your mind?
- That's a woman's privilege, isn't it?
Maybe I got to thinking about what you said, you know... getting a job and... maybe someday getting married and...
Well, it's all right here and... there's a souvenir for you too.
- Where you leave them?
- That's not part of the deal.
Someday I'll be giving this back to the Sundance kid.
- Nervous?
- I'm scared to death.
Easy does it.
If anything happens to iron Betsy there there won't be no bank in Guthrie.
Oh Dave, do me a favor.
Take Grey Eagle up to the burial ground, I'll meet you there later.
All right Vance, I'll take care of him.
- Oh, judge.
- Yes, Vance?
Here's a young lady that has something to say to you.
- Yeah? What is it?
- I guess you're looking for me.
- The name is Cheyenne.
- The girl outlaw, eh?
Oh, where did you catch her?
I didn't. She came in voluntarily.
- You mean, she's giving herself up?
- Of her own free will, remember that judge.
Oh, I see.
Let me through here.
What's the matter? Need any help?
Oh, there's nothing the matter... but I got a big surprise for you John, eh?
Here all your bonds, safe and sound.
Well, where you get them?
- This young lady brought them back.
- Well, I'm sure obliged to her.
- Why, why, she's one of the...
- Yeah, yeah, they know all about it.
Oh, oh, they do, eh?
Well, we're sure back in business Vance.
Come on Cheyenne, I'll have to take her back to Fort Smith for trial Vance but...,
I'll remember what you've said.
Well, I guess this is goodbye, thanks for everything.
Good luck Cheyenne.
Vance, what happened?
Well, the outlaws came to my ranch while I was away.
The Sundance Kid got gun crazy and killed Grey Eagle.
What did she mean, thanks for everything?
- Oh, I got Doc Green to patch up her arm.
- What made her give herself up?
I suppose she decided was the best thing to do.
You mean you decided.
Well, call it half and half.
Vance, what you going to do about Grey Eagle?
- Let the law handle it.
- You sure?
Now, don't you worry Madge.
We've still got that date for California.
I'll see you at the train.
All right. Step up, folks.
Step back in the car folks.
- Goodbye Mary.
- Goodbye Henry, I'm sure going to miss you.
Now, don't worry I'll send for you as soon as I get us a good place staked out.
I'll be waiting.
- Hey Frank?
- Yeah?
I'll hold all the supplies in
Kansas City till I hear from you.
You'll be hearing from me as soon as I can get our store up.
- Good luck Frank.
- Same to you.
Goodbye.
This is the last train out of Braxton folks.
All aboard.
- Well, looks like you're on your way.
- Dad, have you seen Vance?
Now, maybe he got delayed, you and Johnny just take it easy in Kansas City.
We'll let you know when everything's in shape.
I don't want to take it easy.
I want to go in the run with you Grandpa.
Somebody is got to guard that safe.
Say, that reminds me. All of our assets are in that safe and it's all on the wagon.
Take good care of your Ma now Johnny.
All aboard.
Ma, look Ma, there he is.
Vance, Vance, here we are.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late but I'll be seeing you soon, get yourself a nice wedding dress.
- What color?
- Blue like your eyes.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Johnny take care of your mother.
- Sure will.
- And look out Madge, take care of yourself.
- I will, write to me Vance.
Don't worry I will, now get inside.
- John, this is the end of Braxton.
- Yeap, and the beginning of Guthrie.
- Let's go.
- All right.
- All set John?
- Yeap.
Don't forget now Vance, get me something right smack-dab in the center of the town..
You know, a bank's got be where folks can see it.
I'll do the best I can.
- One minute, pass the word. Get ready to go.
- Yes sir.
- See you there.
- Good luck.
- Vance, how long take you to shave?
- Oh, about 15-20 minutes, why?
Let me see now, 7 times 20,
Why, is over 2 hours a week.
Times 52...
You realize you lose 4 full days out of your life every year just hacking your whiskers off?
- Is that why you got a beard?
- Sure.
Why, in 10 years you've wasted over a month.
Think of it, a whole month wasted just shaving.
Why, if nobody ever shaved then everybody would look like you.
- Well, what's wrong with that?
- What's wrong with that? Here.
- Tack that up for me, will you?
- Sure.
- Hello Vance.
- Hiya Muley.
Let's have a little service around here, what kind of a bank is this anyhow?
There's where we do business, right over at the window.
Well Muley, you're my first customer, you come in to pay me back that 300 you owe me?
Well, not exactly John.
You kind of got the pig by the tail instead of the snout.
Fact is I had in mind to borrow $200.
Sorry, Lending department ain't open yet, just the receiving.
Now, wait a minute John.
I spent that money you gave me before for a wagon and tools.
Now I got to build me a barn to keep the wagon and tools in.
Seems to me I've done everything but plow your ground for you.
- You could help Sundays.
- Yeah...
Sign there.
- Hello Vance.
- Oh, hello colonel.
Well, from the looks of that
I guess civilization is really here now.
It's a beginning anyway.
It makes you wonder though.
Where do they all come from?
Sometimes that's an unhealthy question to ask.
Well, I don't know, it's been a lot quieter so far than we'd expected.
Well, with a mob like this there'll be a lot of weeding out to do... before Guthrie settles down to being a real town.
- Maybe, but we won't be around for that.
- No?
No, my orders are to clear out as soon as the main rush is over.
Is that so?
- See you later Vance.
- So long colonel.
Put your hands up.
All right, get out and keep your hands up.
Hurry up.
Stick them up.
Doggone it Johnny, you might've got yourself shot.
Madge, what you doing here? We didn't send for you yet.
I didn't wait to be sent for.
Absence may make the heart grow fonder but there's no sense in overdoing it.
Where is he?
- Who? Vance?
- How you guess?
He's over at the army headquarters, they're pulling out today.
- Where is it?
- Across the street.
Well, what do you think of the new bank?
I didn't come all these miles to see a bank, come on.
Excuse, please.
Well, there he is. Ain't you going to let him know you're here?
Dad.
Well Vance, I guess that just about lines us up here.
Well, we hate to see you go colonel, you've done a very fine job.
Thanks.
Jim, take care of yourself.
Who takes over? Have you decided yet?
Well, that's why I asked you all to come here.
Folks, you're the ones who will be living in the territory... so I wanted to be sure the man I appointed marshal met with your approval.
By virtue of his experience as a Texas ranger and a peace officer... the man best qualified for the job is Mr. Cordell here.
Well I... appreciate the confidence, ladies and gentlemen... however, I'm afraid however,
I'm afraid I can't accept.
I'm not going to be staying here, in fact
I'm pulling out myself in a few days.
Why, it isn't a permanent job Vance, it's just a temporary appointment... until such time as regular peace officers can be trained and made available.
I understand sir but, you see...
Perhaps I haven't made myself entirely clear.
I'm operating under direct authority from the President of the United States.
My orders are to select the best...
You'd better hurry if you're going to stop this.
- Wait a minute.
- You heard what that feller said.
They're going to make him marshal.
It isn't just a question of personal convenience colonel.
It's, well it, it involves more than my own plans.
So do we, there's 30,000 of us in this territory and we want protection.
I realize that, it's just that I...
Get him to doc.
Look out, let me through here.
- What's wrong, Steve?
- A holdup right this side of three forks.
They shot Tom Allen before he get his hands up.
- How many were there?
- Three of them.
But only got a good look at the one that shot Tom.
- Recognize him?
- He looked like the Sundance kid to me.
- Sundance kid, eh?
- Yeah.
- All right Steve, I'll take care of it.
- Thank you colonel.
Colonel, I've changed my mind, I'll take the job.
Good Vance, good.
See, I'm going to swear you in right now.
As a former Texas ranger you're probably... familiar with the oath of office of the United States marshal.
Yes, sir.
Ma, did you hear that?
Uncle Vance is going to be the marshal.
By virtue of the authority vested in me
I appoint you United States Marshal.
Congratulations.
Vance, look who's here.
Well, hello Johnny, where in the world did you come from? Is your mother here?
- She heard everything.
- Excuse me.
Madge, Madge.
- Hello Vance.
- What a happy surprise.
I guess we both got one.
It won't be for long. I'll train some new men to take over, men who are staying here.
And we'll be on our way in no time..
- Just as soon as...
- Just as soon as you get Sundance.
- That's what you really want, isn't it?
- Well, it's part of the job.
I understand, Vance.
Twos right, twos right.
I swear daughter, if you was a little mite younger I'd take you across my knee and...
- What's the matter?
- Matter?
What you think is the matter? Vance tells me you're postponing the wedding.
That's right.
Fine time to walk out on him, just when he's taking on a big job.
Oh, I'm not walking out on him.
- Vance understands.
- Well, I don't.
You ought to marry him right here and now.
Just because your first husband was a peace officer, don't mean...
We both agree it's best to wait.
Dad, every night if Vance were late
I'd think of the last time I waited... and how they brought Johnny's father home.
Maybe men can get over things like that but I could never go through it again.
I wouldn't be any good for him.
Oh, leave me alone, can't you?
You think I don't want to marry him?
Sure, sure, I understand honey.
I guess I'd better stick to that dad-blame banking business.
Sometimes I don't think you're very smart
Sundance and this is one of the times.
This stuff ain't going to walk in by itself.
Somebody has to go out and get it.
We didn't have to come to this territory for chicken feed like that.
- Can't you get that through your head?
- I don't notice you're doing any better.
We will when I give the word and not before.
You start fooling around with penny ante stuff like that... first thing you know, you got a country full of posses before the big pickings are ripe.
- All right Bill, but Sundance thought...
- Never mind what Sundance thought.
Let me do the thinking.
I planned this and I'll run it.
Anybody wants to operate different he checks out right now.
You've been riding me ever since we started.
You heard the deal, make up your mind.
Hey Doolin, here comes the Dalton boys.
- All right Danny?
- Hi Bob. Hi Emmett. Hi Grat.
- Hiya Bob.
- What you say?
- Hello Bob.
- Hi Emmett, glad to see you again.
- Hiya Doolin.
- Hello Bob.
Well, how's that chunk of sheriff's lead in your leg?
Reliable as ever Bob, gives off sparks like a flint when things ain't right..
Sure is a miserable country you picked out.
Where's all them big, fat banks you wrote us about?
He's saving it up for our old age.
Me and Sundance were just about to settle something.
- You might as well get in on it too.
- Shoot.
This a new country, the army is been running it up to now but they're leaving.
I don't want to start anything till... they're back where they belong and these new towns got enough in them to go after.
Then we'll split up and go so fast their new deputies won't know what hit them or when.
- Sounds Ok to me.
- Another thing.
We're going to keep the homesteaders neutral.
If we need beef or a new horse, we pay for it.
Let them know they won't get hurt as long as they play square with us.
Well, that's just common sense.
What is to settle about that?
- Somebody has to be boss.
- We've ridden with you before.
- We'll string along.
- It's your party, you call it.
Well, we going to stand here gabbing all day?
- Why don't you get rid of him?
- He's a good man.
So long as you keep him in front of you.
Arkansas, take care of the horses.
Judge Harper, glad to see you.
When did you get in?
- Just now.
- What brings you here, business or pleasure?
Well, a little of both.
How's the new job coming?
- Oh, all right I guess, sit down.
- Any news of the Doolin gang?
Not since that holdup.
- Maybe he pulled out.
- You know Doolin.
In an un-organized territory like this he'd never pull out after one job.
No, no, it doesn't sound like him.
What do you make of it?
I don't know.
All I'm sure of is... he's got something up his sleeve and the longer he waits the bigger it's going to be.
- Now, who's in there?
- Why don't you go see?
Cheyenne, what you doing here?
Oh, just practicing and I'm not Cheyenne anymore, I'm back to Jeanie McBride again.
Say, let me look at you.
Oh, you've changed more than just your name. I'd hardly know you.
Well, I can't tell whether that's a compliment or not.
Oh, stop fishing and tell him why you're here.
Well, the judge thought...
That is, if it's all right with you.
Well, he's willing to parole me if we can...
I've always figured that the function of the law was to rehabilitate as well as punish.
She'll be a lot better off working in an honest job than... sitting out her term in a woman's reformatory.
That's swell judge, but...
You see, I've got to be paroled to someone and I've got to have a job and... well, we thought maybe if you were looking for a good telegrapher...
Well, I didn't know you could handle one of those.
Uncle Bill taught me it... it sometimes came in handy for his business.
How about it, Vance?
You're hired.
I promise you won't be sorry and you too judge.
- Well, that's that.
- Thanks.
I got the papers right here.
I also brought along the marriage license.
Thought you might as well sign them both at once.
- Sign the parole right there.
- All right.
I've got to go back in a couple of days.
Are you and Madge all set for the wedding?
I'm afraid we'll have to catch you next time, judge.
You see, we decided to put it off until after the marshal job is over.
You better not wait too long or I'll marry her myself.
- Oh Cheyenne, have you got a place to stay?
- Oh not yet, I wasn't sure I was staying.
Well, Madge is at the hotel. I'll take... you over and she'll look after you until you can find a place.
That'll be nice.
Coming.
- Vance.
- Hello Madge.
- You remember Che, I mean Jeanie McBride.
- Yes, I remember her.
Our last meeting wasn't too fortunate, I hope I can live it down.
Well, won't you come in?
Thanks.
Jeanie is just been paroled to me by judge Harper.
She's going to work in the office.
I just got her a room here so you could sort of look after her if she needed a hand.
Why yes, of course.
I told Vance, oh I mean, Mr. Cordell...
You were right the first time, nobody calls me mister around here.
Well, I said it wasn't fair for him to ask you to do this for me.
Oh, I'm glad to do it.
Good, good. Then you two can keep each other company.
Well, thanks you both, I got to go and unpack, I'll see you later Mrs. Allen.
Madge, that's mighty fine of you, she's really going to need a friend around here.
Seemed to me that day at the bank she could take care of herself quite well.
Well...
- Come on honey, give her a chance.
- All right, on one condition.
Name it.
That you never again sweep in here like that when I'm doing laundry.
Why, you look beautiful.
Go on downstairs now and wait for me while I get dressed.
- See you later.
- Yes.
- How it go?
- Fine judge.
- They'll get along like a couple of sisters.
- Good, I knew we could depend on Madge.
That's quite a fire.
- Looks like everybody in town is down there.
- Yeap, everybody but us.
That was the idea.
All right boys.
You see that nut hole on the hitching post across the street there?
- Yes sir.
- Well, you line up on that.
Now, you don't jerk the trigger, you know.
You just squeeze it a little mite.
- Understand?
- You bet Mr. Pettit.
Just squeeze it a little mite.
- Yeah, you're going to be all right son.
- Thank you sir.
You know, I'm going to make a good shot out of that young feller.
- That's what we need.
- Well, what's your next move?
I've blocked out the whole territory in the district.
Say, that's a lot of ground to cover, ain't it?
Yes, but...
Here's a message that just came from Ardmore.
Round up the boys Dave.
- Looks like they've started.
- Yes sir.
Looks like we better get started too.
- Howdy mister.
- Howdy.
We've lost the trail of some outlaws up by Shawnee.
I wondered if you'd seen any signs of them out this way.
I wouldn't know who was outlaws and who wasn't.
Well, have you seen any strangers around here?
I never notice strangers mister.
Lately, it seems all you farmers find it convenient to keep your eyes and ears shut.
Well, I always try to mind my own business and keep out of other people's.
Outlaws are your business too.
This is your country, we can't fight robbery and murder if the people in it don't help us.
Well, I'm getting all the fighting I want with the soil and the weather.
- It's all I can handle.
- We're not asking you to fight.
All we want is information.
Look, Mr. Marshal, I got a wife and 2 kids.
Them bandits ain't bothering me and I don't aim to give them no reason to.
Understand your feelings friend... but withholding information from the law isn't going to make this territory... safe for your wife and family.
As soon as you realize that get in touch with my office in Guthrie.
- So long friend.
- So long.
Hello.
- Oh, I saw the light on, and I thought...
- No, he isn't back yet.
- You must be expecting him tonight.
- I never expect him until I see him.
- I just work here, you know.
- All night?
- I like my job.
- Yes, I know.
- You haven't said yet when he'll be back.
- Well, I really couldn't tell you.
- If you care to leave the tray...
- Oh, I'll wait.
Suit yourself.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thanks.
I'm sorry you resent my coming down here.
After all you know, I'm engaged to him.
Yes, I know.
You're engaged but you don't want to get married until you can have things your way.
You don't care anything about his work.
You never try to do anything to help him that'll make things easier for him.
- You're in love with him too, aren't you?
- Suppose I am.
What you going to do about it?
What would you do if you were in my place?
If I were in your place,
I'd marry him right away.
Fortunately however, you're not in my place.
It would be better for him if I were.
- I really don't care to discuss it.
- Well, I do.
It may not ladylike to talk like this but, well, thank goodness I'm not a lady.
If I loved a man and he wanted me
I wouldn't wait for orange blossoms... and a honeymoon in California.
Why, I'd marry him in a blizzard in the middle of a desert.
- Are you all through?
- Why?
- Did I shock you?
- No.
Before you try any harder to let me tell you something.
I was raised in a frontier country.
When I was a girl
I used to load the guns for my... father and mother when the Indians raided our farm.
I was alone in the house for 12 hours when my child was born.
So don't confuse good manners with softness.
Well, doesn't anyone ever go to sleep around here?
- We were just waiting for you.
- Any luck?
No, same old story, hit and run.
It's just like trying to catch ghosts.
- Where the coffee come from?
- Oh, I thought you'd be needing it.
You bet, Jeanie must've told you I'd be late.
- Oh, some messages came while you were gone.
- Anything important?
- No.
- Well, I'll look at them in the morning.
You look a little tired Jeanie.
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?
That's a good idea.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night Vance,
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night Jeanie.
Oh, that's fine.
That sure hits the spot.
- Tired?
- A little.
You know Madge, they really ran us ragged.
First, they were here, then
2 days later they were over here.
Then back this way, then up to Osage.
Not even the Doolin gang can move that fast.
They must be operating in teams on a regular schedule.
What can you do about it?
I want to see if there's some sort of pattern to it.
If I can figure out how they're operating... maybe next time I can be there first, waiting for them.
- Let me see now.
- Vance...
No, trouble is there's still too many places for them to hit.
Would you like to get married right away?
I just proposed to you.
You're a little late.
I beat you to that 3 months ago.
- Oh, I mean right away, tomorrow.
- Now what brought this on?
Oh?
That's not a very romantic answer.
No, but you're not looking at a very romantic guy right now.
Well, it was just an idea.
Look Madge...
You know better than that.
We decided it would be best to wait until after this was over and we were right.
We wouldn't be having much home life these days.
I think I'd better finish up my work tonight and...
Oh, then I'll go Vance,
I don't want to disturb you.
Thanks for the coffee.
And the proposal.
Vance...
I hope you catch them very soon.
- Don't work too late.
- I won't.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Excuse me.
Scared you, didn't it?
Kind of fooled you for a minute.
Why, it's nothing but the wind.
Go boy, get along now.
Giddy up now, giddy up now.
700, 800, this rate Emily, you'll soon be owning the bank.
- What would I do with a bank?
- I swear I don't know.
I sometimes wonder what I'm doing with it.
- That was 800, wasn't it?
- You counted it.
Yeah, yeah, 800 dollars.
There you are Emily, just for that, you can dance with me tonight.
There won't be no dancing in Guthrie tonight.
John, John...
- Here's that $500 I owe you John.
- What you doing in here Muley?
Go on around to the window there where I do business.
- Now then, what can I do for you?
- Here John, take it quick.
Oh, what's the rush?
Say, you look like you've seen a ghost.
I did John, weirdest ghost you ever seen.
Oh?
I've seen it, I tell you. Seen it with my own eyes sweeping out the saloon at Braxton.
A ghost sweeping out a saloon?
You got to quit drinking Muley.
I did, when I seen that ghost.
I guess I better put that ghost on my payroll. That's 10, 20, 30...
Howdy John.
- Hi, I'll walk home with you.
- All right.
Closing up a little early today, aren't you?
It's all right, best part of being president.
Open up when you want, close up when you get tired.
Besides, I've done enough business this morning to last me all week.
- Yeah?
- Yes sir, I got them coming and going.
Emily dropped in on her way out of town to deposit $800.
Yeah?
Yes, just as she was leaving Muley
Wilson comes busting in all heated up.
- He paid back 500.
- Good, good.
Said he'd seen a ghost weeping out the saloon at Braxton.
- A ghost?
- That's what he said.
Anything that makes
Muley pay up I ain't arguing with.
I reckon he figured maybe the spirits was getting ready to give him a private party.
Now, if some of my other customers just get the same id...
- Say John, did Emily say where she's going?
- No, but she sure was all dressed up.
- She was?
- Fit to kill.
Say John, you don't know it but you closed too early, you're going to open up again..
Hey, wait a minute here, I don't...
Here they are Vance.
- You sure these are the bills she gave you?
- I put them right on top, all together.
Brand new, right out of a bank vault.
I may be crazy, but tell Jeanie to get in touch with Ardmore in Tulsa.
Have him send all their deputies to meet me right out of Braxton...
- as fast as they can get there.
- You think the bandits are there?
- You're too nosy, I'll get my men together.
- You got one together right now.
- How's it going Jeanie?
- Well, I've sent all the messages.
Good.
Take care of things while I'm gone.
You're in full charge, remember that.
- You remember and take care of yourself.
- I will.
Gangway, let me through there boys.
Vance, Vance. Well, come on.
What are we waiting for?
I know how you feel, John, but you're not a deputy.
The heck I ain't.
I found out where you keep your badges.
Deputy John Pettit, let's go.
- So long Jeanie, keep your fingers crossed.
- Good luck.
Vance...
Oh, I thought I'd miss you.
- Hurry back, I'll have the coffee waiting.
- Good and keep it hot.
All right boys.

Why don't you wipe that sour look off your face Doolin, you're spoiling the party.
We're supposed to be enjoying ourselves.
You'll enjoy yourself a lot more by staying away from me.
Easy Sundance, let's go.
- Bill, just like old times, ain't it?
- Yeah,
- You don't seem to be having no fun.
- No, I ain't.
Looks like the rest of our boys not going to show up.
What you going to do now Vance?
Can't afford to wait any longer.
Kind of scary, ain't it? Being the only people in the whole town.
Be a whole lot more scary if we wasn't the only people in the whole town.
People in Guthrie sure be surprised to see me now.
Who would ever think this old saloon would ever see a party again?
Why, it's like something coming back from the dead.
- Hey, what's the matter?
- I don't know.
I just got a feeling something is wrong, come on inside.
- Come along, come along.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold that music, turn off the lights.
- What's the matter Doolin?
- I don't know, yet.
- Oh, what you stopping the music for?
- Hold on Doolin.
I suppose that leg of yours is acting up again.
- What if it is? Let's look around Cole.
- Wait a minute Doolin.
I ain't letting you bust up this party on account of your rheumatism.
I thought we settled this once, I'm giving the orders.
Not tonight you're not.
Somebody is got to cut you down to size
Sundance, I guess now is the time..
Turn off those lights.
We've got you surrounded Doolin, you and your men come out with your hands up.
Emily get your girls out of the way.
Cole, Jim, Bob, Emmett, Grat, follow me.
Haul it out.
Emmett, get ready to open those doors as soon as I light this.
The rest of you push it out into the street as soon as it hits make a break for it.
What about you Bill?
You'll make it all right?
Never mind about me, I'll take care of myself.
All right, hurry it up.
We want to be out of this county by sundown.
Why don't you boys stick around, this is a big territory.
- Not big enough.
- Bill had the right idea, shoot and run.
- Only he didn't run fast enough.
- I'll get the horse.
- Right with you.
- So long.
- Where you heading for Bob?
- Back to Kansas I guess, see you.
- So long.
- So long.
Anybody got any extra shells?
What's the matter with you guys, you deaf?
We heard you.
- You got plenty of them.
- I need them myself.
I suppose you think it's all my fault, don't you?
What do you think?
If you'd listen to Bill when you should've we wouldn't be packing now.
All right, so I talked out of turn.
But if you're such pals of Doolin's why don't you stay here and help me... bust him loose instead of running out.
You talk big Sundance, they got every deputy in town guarding him.
They got to get him out of town for the trial, don't they?
Sure, they're going to put up a great big sign... says, Bill Doolin leaving on train number 9.
- Suppose I can get that information for you.
- How?
Ride into town with me and find out.
When you get the information we'll ride with you.
I'll get it.
- Anybody with me?
- Arkansas and me are with you.
Hello Cheyenne,
I didn't know you all dressed up.
- What do you want?
- We've come to help you.
- I don't need your help.
- Your uncle Bill does.
You wouldn't want to see him go to prison for life, would you?
All you got to do is tell us what day they're taking him away, we'll do the rest.
Nobody would know you had anything to do with it.
You want me to double cross the people that trust me, is that it?
Now listen kid...
I'm going to get what I came after one way or the other is up to you how easy it goes.
- I'm not going to tell you a thing.
- I'm asking you for the last time nice.
- When are they taking him away?
- I won't tell you.
- Help.
- Come here.
Shut off them lights.
Now we'll have the whole territory on our trail.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go.
Hey Sundance.
- What's the matter?
- My horse has gone lame.
What do you expect me to do about it?
Looks like you'll have to let me ride double till I get another horse.
I guess you're right, this ain't no country for a man to be on foot.
Take off your saddle and give it to Bill.
Hey Sundance.
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired of running.
Let's wait for him and finish it right here.
Not me.
If you're going to stay here, you stay alone.
All right, I'll wait alone.
At least I won't finish like Arkansas.
Give me a chance Cordell.
Give you a chance like you gave Grey Eagle and Cheyenne?
- That was an accident, I didn't mean...
- I said someday I'd give you your gun back.
And this is it.
But first, you and
I've got a lot of things to settle.
Hey Muley, we got to answer this letter.
It's been laying around here for a long time.
Now you put down what I tell you.
Dear Jim, enclosed find $1,000 you asked for in your last letter.
That's the way I'd like to start this letter only your security ain't no good... and you don't get the money.
Sign it John J. Pettit.
I wish I'd never seen this dad-blasted banking business.
- What about some service over here?
- Well, what can I do for you?
We want to borrow $5,000 in a hurry.
Well, if your collateral's all right
I guess we can make you a deal.
Will this due?
You ain't aiming to borrow 5,000 dollars on your wedding ring?
Well, it's worth lots more than that to me.
A lot of money you're asking for and it's a long ways to California for me to collect.
- You might as well tell him Madge.
- We're staying right here dad.
I've decided Oklahoma needs
Vance more than California does.
You mean you're going to settle right here in Guthrie permanent?
That's right.
Well, you kids have got yourself a bank, is yours lock, stock and barrel.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Come on back here Vance and go to work.
Madge will show you how it's done.
Come on Muley, change your coat, hook up a team, we're going to California.
- I'm with you John.
- Come on man, don't fool around here.
- Yeah.
- No time to waist.
- [Woman]Juanillo?
- Yes, Mother?
- Go to sleep.
- Yes, Mother.

[Speaking Spanish]
- Thank you. Thank you, amigos.
- The miracles you performed this afternoon—
I, Curro, tell you you didn't need your sword.
You killed that bull with your cape.
[Laughing] Curro, these women kill more often than the bulls.
[Laughing]
- Garabato, where did you get this scar?
- Oh, this one?
- I got that in, uh— in Bilbao.
- [Spanish]
Tell me something. Is it true your body is covered all over like a map?
Well, gachi, during the 19 years
I've exercised my profession...
I've killed 2,912 bulls...
[Chattering]
And I've been gored 67 times.
With my hand on my heart, I, Curro... declare all nations of the Earth should come and admire toreros like Garabato.
They may have ships,
they may have gold... but they have no man like this.
I, Curro, tell you this man... is greater than Frascuelo or Mazzantini or Lagartijo!
Oh, come now, Curro.
Not greater than Lagartijo.
Yes! By the life of the blue dove,
even greater than Lagartijo.
- But not greater than Gallardo!
- [Man] The boy's right.
- Gallardo was a great killer of bulls.
- You mean a butcher.
He belonged to the slaughterhouse, not to the bull ring.
- I spit in your milk!
- With his cape and muleta,
Gallardo was phenomenal.
Ah, no. Garabato is the best bullfighter in the world.
- Gallardo was the greatest torero of all time!
- Torero?
Who called that perro a torero?
I knew that mamarracho.
I was there the day he was killed.
He trembled like a leaf.
- He had cats in his belly.

Olé! Olé! Superb!
Juanillo! Come here, you rascal!
[Spanish]
- Are you hurt?
- No!
- It was only a caress, nothing more.
- [Spanish]
And this time I mean it.
Trespassing.
Spoiling our best bulls.
Criminal entry.
Tonight you can sleep in the barn,
but tomorrow morning...
I'm going to turn you over
to the police.
Tell me, muchacho, how did you feel when you were fighting that bull?
Sort of gay. Very gay.
That's the way I always feel when I fight a bull.
Where did you learn that cape work?
He's been coming here like this ever since he was that high.
- More of a pest than the fly that plagued the cattle.
- You weren't afraid?
Afraid? Excelencia, I was born under a good shadow with a cape in my hands.
- That bicho couldn't hurt me.
- ¿Bicho?
Do you know that animal's a Miura?
They're only like any others.
My father killed scores of Miura bulls.
The boy's name is Gallardo.
Gallardo.
So, that's where you got it.
- You knew my father?
- Quite well.
- Was he a good torero?
- One of the best.
- Ah.
- I was there at Cordoba... the day your father was killed by a Miura bull... probably the great-grandfather of the bull that almost killed you a while ago.
There's always been a great feud between
the Gallardo men and the Miura bulls.
They've been killing each other for generations.
My father said that's what they're made for.
When I get to be a matador, my first formal bull will be a Miura.
Excelencia, someday,
I'll make the church bells ring.
There, now. When they hang you, at least you'll be dressed properly.
- Gracias, señor.
- I came here to see bulls.
And instead, I saw a bullfighter... and I must say he is an original.
Maestro,
I'm your unconditional admirer.
Oh, thank you, excelencia.
Everybody in Spain is the unconditional admirer of Don Jose Alvarez.
Ah. When you become a matador... perhaps you'll let me be your impresario.
- My hand on it.
- Be sure I'm fully conscious of the honor.
Good evening.
I'm off, Pedro.
God give you a good night, excelencia.
[Whistling]
¡: Hola! ¡: Hola!
- Carmencita, I'm sorry to wake you like this.
- You didn't wake me.
- I've been up for hours.
- You have?
You should've seen me fight a big, enormous bull. The biggest.
I did see you. I was afraid the bull might kill you.
How many times have I told you?
I can dominate any bull.
- Don't you believe me?
- Yes, but—
Listen. I've gotta tell you before your father gets back.
I didn't come here tonight just to fight a bull.
I wanted to see you and say good-bye.
I'm going to Madrid.
- M-Madrid? When?
- First thing in the morning.
- Alone?
- No. The others are going with me.
The whole cuadrilla—
Manolo, Sebastian, Luis and Pablo.
- What are you going for?
- You can't be a bullfighter unless you go to Madrid.
I'm running away.
It's a good thing too. I'm in trouble.
Every policía in town
is looking for me right now.
I killed a man.
Juanillo!
At La Veronica tonight. A great big fat goat insulted my father's name.
Said he had cats in his belly.
- So I killed him.
- When will you come back from Madrid?
When I'm the greatest torero in the world.
Then and only then.
- Will you wait for me?
- How long?
How long will you wait?
Forever.
You won't have to wait that long,
I promise you.
When I come back, I'll be rich and famous with my name in the papers.
And whatever I have, I'll—
[Gasps]
And whatever I have,
I'll lay at your feet... and we'll be married in the church of San Gil if you're willing.
I'm willing.
- [Door Opens]
- Here comes your father.
- Good-bye, Carmencita.
- Good-bye, Juanillo.
[Chattering]
[Dog Barking]
- Olé, Encarnacion.
- Granuja. Scum!
Mother's looking for you.
You're going to get it.
- Get what, Sister?
- Another broomstick broken over your head.
I don't mind that.
I've even brought my own broomstick.
A fine brother you are. Your mother and your sister work their hands to the bone... while you go off to play with bulls.
Not play with them, Encarnacion— fight them.
I wish one of them would kill you.
Then we wouldn't have to feed you anymore.
- The bull that can kill me hasn't been born yet.
- [Scoffs]
- Where did you go last night?
- To practice, Mother.
One doesn't have to practice for death.
You promised you wouldn't go to the ranch anymore!
You knew I couldn't keep my promise.
Oh.
Aren't you going to beat me?
I'm tired of beating you.
Where did you steal those clothes?
I didn't steal them.
I got them from Pedro Espinosa.
And who do you suppose I met there?
Don Jose Alvarez.
He saw me fight a bull, an enormous bull.
He said he was my unconditional admirer.
He wants to be my manager when I get to be a matador.
I hope I never see the day.
I've made up my mind.
I'm not gonna starve... for the rest of my life on gazpacho and rotten codfish.
And Encarnacion— how about her?
How could she get a husband unless
I make money for her dowry? And you—
I don't wanna see you for the rest of your life on your knees scrubbing floors.
That's what your father said too.
And here I am... on my knees.
[Chuckles]
Oh, you.
You're your father come back to plague me again.
He died once, and I died a thousand times.
Every time he went into the ring.
And now you— you want me to die a thousand times more.
Madre, I've hurt you a lot... and maybe I'll hurt you some more.
If I do, please forgive me.
And maybe someday you'll be proud of me.
Oh!
Good-bye, Madrecita.
- Come on. You turn too quick.
- He's no good today.
Come on. Just a little more speed there in your run.
- He has no grace.
- Hola, amigos.
- We got something.
- Yeah, a surprise.
- I got it.
- Come over here.
- You'd never guess what it is.
- What is it?
- A surprise.
- A horse!
Yes. I got to thinking.
Madrid's 600 kilometers from here.
- I found the horse standing near the road, and I thought—
- Good idea, Manolo.
- Wait. That's my horse.
- Who's the leader of this cuadrilla?
You may call yourself the leader, but I'm going to ride the horse.
How's it going to look for a matador to walk while one of his men rides a horse?
I'm going to be a matador too.
We might as well agree on one thing before we start.
There's only one matador in this cuadrilla, and his name is Juan Gallardo.
- Sebastian, are you with me?
- Always.
- Potaje?
- I follow.
- Pablo?
- Me too.
- Manolo?
- I'm coming along, all right, but I ride.
There's only one way to settle a matter like this.

You men stay here.
What are you gonna do?
- Stop the train.
- How are you gonna stop it?
Have you ever seen a bull stop a train?
- Yes, but you're not a bull.
- I can stop a bull, so I can stop a train.
[Whistle Blowing]
[Whistle Blowing]
- God give you a good evening, Senor Engineer.
- What?
We're on our way to the corrida in Madrid.
Mi capitán, we've come all the way from Sevilla.
We've walked 500 kilometers
already, excelencia.
All right, you whelps of hell.
Get aboard.
Come on, muchachos!
Compañeros, you may do as you please.
But as for me, I'm through.
We're doomed, all of us, because we haven't got an education.
For 10 years now, we've been risking our necks in a hundred arenas.
And where are we?
Just where we started from.
How much better it would've been if we'd joined up with the Workman's Federation... and served our class.
Or at least joined the national militia and served our country.
As it is, whom have we served?
Nobody, not even ourselves.
One of us hasn't done so badly for himself.
Eh, Juanillo?
- I can't complain, Manolo.
- I can.
- My pockets are empty.
- You don't make as much as I do.
Your pockets are bulging
with pesetas right now.
Four thousand. Not a bad season.
And someday I'll make twice that much in one afternoon.
[Whistle Blowing]
Look! Look— my picture!
- [Voices Overlapping]
- Now, that's recognition.
There's something under it.
What does it say?
Huh? Oh.
- Hey, you! I mean you! Come here!
- [Spanish]
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on!
- Good morning, señores.
- Can you read?
- Yes, thank you.
- Good. Read this.
Right there.
- Well, come on. Come on. Read it.
- Let's hear it.
Señores, this is an article by the great critic Curro.
In it, he— he praises the merits of various novilleros... including Juan Gallardo.
- That's me!
- That's him!
[Juan]
What does it say?
[Man]
Let's hear it. Come on.
Easily the most promising of the season's newcomers is Juan Gallardo.
His work in the ring is... classic, pure and perfect.
I declare that nothing like it
has been seen...
from Fuentes, Garabato
or from anybody else.
It will not be long before all Spain
rings with his praise... and Sevilla should be proud of its son... whose name will one day cover it with, uh— with undying glory.
- Thank you, amigo.
- The sun comes alas from behind the clouds.
- I tell ya, praise from Curro spells contracts.
- The beginning of history!
- It's only one man's opinion.
- One man's, yes.
But when that one man happens to be Curro—
Sevilla. Sevilla.
Sevilla.

Huh?

- Oh!
For you, Madrecita.
Oh. Oh, Juanillo.
##[Flamenco]
Look at Juan over there.
We do all the work, he takes all the bows.
One of these days,
I'm going out on my own.
- When?
- As soon as I get together a good cuadrilla.
Men like yourselves.
I could use you all.
I'll pay you twice what he does.
What do you say, huh?
I am not interested.
I am through with bullfighting.
It's the most reactionary of professions.
I renounce it here and now.
Someday, the people will renounce it too.
- What about you two?
- First time I ever met Juan Gallardo, we fought.
I was much bigger than Juan, but he bit off part of my ear... and part of my heart went with it.
I love the man.
I'll work for no other.
- How about you?
- Me too.

Well, now, here are the two longest faces in Andalucía.
What's the matter?
Aren't you enjoying yourselves?
Encarnacion, what's wrong?
Antonio Lopez, you tell me.
Your sister and I have been engaged now for four years.
Each year, we've been planning to get married.
- And now—
- Yes?
Now we should be married.
Well—Well, that's all right.
Why don't you get married?
Antonio's been let out of the saddlery shop.
What'll it take to open a shop of your own?
I should think about 2,000 pesetas.
You're in business.
You mean—
Oh, thank you very much. Thank you.
- It's a wedding present.
- Thank you.
- And I hope it's a boy.
- Yes.
Amigos! Amigos! Step up, everybody.
Come up close.
Amigos, I have an important announcement to make.
The marriage of my sister Encarnacion to Antonio Lopez... which will take place as soon as possible.
In honor of this great occasion...
I wish to present you with a few gifts that I brought you from Madrid.
- Lorenzo Rodriguez. Angelina Marcos.
- [Woman Shouts In Spanish]
Carlos.
Mateo.
Elena. Fernando.
Enrique.
No, no. Not that one.
Who's this one for, Juanillo?
It's a secret. It's for someone who isn't here just now.
[All Clamoring]
Hermano.
Excuse me, but things have been going rather badly with me lately.
- I thought maybe you could help a little.
- Garabato.
Yes, I regret to say I am still alive.
But I thought you'd retired and gone to the country and bought a ranch.
[Chuckles]
Oh, no, no.
No, I left the ring just as I came into it— without a peseta.
Oh, thank you so much.
Oh, thank you. This will—
Oh! Juan Gallardo!
Things have been going great for you lately, haven't they?
Yes, I had a good season.
I look forward to a better one.
Oh, that is good.
- I suppose your cuadrilla—
- It's full up just now.
Oh. Oh, well,
I've had a lot of experience.
I've spent most of my life in the bull ring.
I know all the critics.
Maybe you could use a sword handler... or a-a servant in the house, anything.
Why not?
Come and, uh—
Come and see me tomorrow.
Thanks.

And all the way on the train from Madrid,
I kept worrying and thinking...
"Perhaps she's tired of waiting.
Perhaps she's gone away.
Perhaps she's even forgotten me."
Oh, you couldn't possibly think that.
You know, I even thought—You know the first thing I asked my mother when I got home?
"Pedro Espinosa's little girl— the one with the skinny legs and the funny face— has she, by any chance, gotten married yet?"
Oh!
I can't get over it.
I never thought that you'd grow up to be so— so very nice to look at.
Juan, why did you never write to me?
Write? Well, you see—
This may sound silly to you, but I didn't wanna write... until I could sign my first letter to you...
"Juan Gallardo, Matador de Toros."
- You haven't had your alternativa yet?
- No, but I haven't done badly.
Do you know what I cleared last season... over and above traveling expenses, renting costumes and all that?
4,000 pesetas.
- Yeah.
And that's nothing to what I'll make later on once I've been recognized.
Of course, I'm not entirely overlooked now, mind you. Not at all.
They're beginning to find out who I am.
Take a look at that.
My first press notice, and by Curro himself.
Pretty nice, don't you think?
Have you read it?
- Of course.
- And you like it?
I think it's wonderful.
- No, read it.
- I have read it.
- Read it aloud.
- Juan, I know why you never wrote to me.
It's because you haven't learned how to write or read.
- Is that it?
- Read what it says.
- What for? I've just—
- Read it!
"And here is a newcomer, a flat-footed novillero from Sevilla...
"taking money under false pretenses.
"He has nothing to recommend him but a certain stupid animal courage... which makes his work in the ring look more like suicide than battle."
[Sighs]
When will we be married?
There's more. Read it.
"He is definitely fifth-rate."
Oh, Juan, when will we be married?
Read the rest.
"It's useless to predict a future for him.
"He will probably be killed in the ring... long before he advances from novillero to matador."
Well, I— I guess I came back a little too early.
But you saw me fight bulls a long time ago.
It's not like that—what it says.
- It doesn't matter.
- But it matters to me!
Juanillo, why don't you throw it away and forget all about it?
No, no. I'm gonna save this.
And someday I'll make that Curro eat his words.
Someday I'll come back to you with a whole trunkful of clippings.
And when you marry me, you'll marry the first torero in Spain.
Not the second or the third, but the first!
The greatest!
I'll go now, Carmen.
- What's in the package?
- Nothing.
- Is it for me?
- Well, it's-it's just something that I—
- But, uh—
- What is it?
It's nothing, Carmen. I—
Oh!
[Audience Cheering]
- [Chattering]
- [Baby Crying]
No, you cannot see him now.
The room is crowded as it is.
But if the matador could only see his godson just for a minute—
Don't you know any better than to bring your brats here today of all days... when Senor Gallardo is about to make his first formal appearance... in his hometown?
- Just for one minute?
- Wednesday. That's the day
Don Juan sees his godchildren.
Do you think you're the only one?
Already, he's godfather
to half the infants in Sevilla.
Presently, we'll have to hire an armory!
Oh. How do you do, gentlemen?
Please come right in.
- Come right in. Yes.
- [Spanish]
[Chattering]
[Chattering Stops]
- [Chattering Resumes]
- Why can't we go in there?
Not today!
[Curro]
I, Curro—
I was present the afternoon
of our Juan's formal presentation...
as a matador in Madrid.
He fought a Miura bull
as big as a cathedral.
Never in my life have I seen
such sincerity...
such purity, such lightheartedness...
and, above all, such serene valor.
Let me read you what I wrote
that night in the Heraldo.
I have the clipping right here with me.
"Rejoice, ye faithful.
"There's an end to the decay of our great art.
"We are on the eve of a great renaissance.
"Cid Campeador has returned...
"to bring back the glory of Spain.
The arena has come back once more to passion and dignity."
- Olé. Olé.
- At last, Sevilla has a matador.
The greatest matador of all history.
A saint.
The first man of the world.
The day he was born, there was salt in the air... a great quantity of salt.
Olé. Olé.
You should have seen him at the corrida of the Feast of the Anunciación.
He was so near the bull, next day...
Garabato spent hours picking the bull's hairs out of Juan's clothes.
Olé. Olé.
[Gasping, Murmuring]
[Man]
Gorgeous! It must cost a fortune!
I don't know whether Juan mentioned it to you or not... but it was I who financed his early career.
- For years, I had to support his whole family.
- Really?
What a corrida.
Ah, his cape work was magnificent.
You would have given a thousand pesetas to see Juanillo with that bull.
I tell you, he had it on a string.
Don Jose, you never saw such arrogance and grace.
- Yes, I did, once.
- What corrida was that?
That was a dozen years ago when I saw a very little boy fight a very big bull.
Curro, that was the night you and I met and split that bottle of wine together.
- Remember?
- Yes, I've carried the scar ever since.
My most prized possession, gentlemen, since it was given me by Juan Gallardo.
[Laughing, Chattering]
I didn't see you again until you fought as a novillero in Madrid.
Oh, yes. You wrote a piece in the paper about me.
You said I was definitely fifth-rate.
I know. But the next time I saw you in the ring, you were a different man.
- Something must've happened to you.
- I got married.
[Chattering]
Yes, those were the lean days... when I fought both bulls and hunger at the same time.
Curro, have you ever been hungry?
Never. I've frequently been thirsty.
Well, I can tell you this.
The gore of hunger is worse than the horns of a bull.
My friends have said to me, "Juanillo, life's been very magnificent to you.
How does it feel to be way up there on top of the ladder?"
Then I think of all the good things that have happened to me... and one thing stands out above everything else.
I can buy all the food my belly can hold... and my friends' bellies, and I don't have to ask the price of anything anymore.
[Chattering]
[Chattering Stops]
Now I'm ready for the grave.
I've just come from the drawing of the bulls.
We've got something on our hands this afternoon.
We've drawn a couple of the meanest-looking beasts I've ever seen.
- Sluggish, treacherous—
- What difference? A bull's a bull.
They're all alike to Juanillo.
All safe.
Senor Lopez, have you ever faced a bull in the ring?
- Well, not exactly.
- There is no such thing as a safe bull.
And these two are monsters with lightning in their horns.
I'm a humble man with no education, and my life isn't worth very much.
But you, maestro—
The cow hasn't been born yet that can give birth to the bull that can hurt me.
Olé! Olé!
That's what I say. You either dominate the bull, or the bull dominates you.
- Now, then—
- [Spanish]
I will not listen to your ignorance and folly... which incapacitates you for any further views in relation to bulls.
And I think it would be well if you were all to go now... and give Juan a few minutes' rest before his ordeal.
Caballeros, Nacional's right.
We'd better be going.
- [Chattering]
- Good luck, senor.
Gracias.
[Spanish]
- [Door Closes]
- Parasites.
Most of them come here to get a free ticket to the corrida or to borrow money.
They'll be the first to turn against you the moment you have any bad luck.
[Spanish]
Wait for me in the carriage.
It's all ignorance and superstition... from not knowing how to read or write.
[Door Opens, Closes]
Hot, isn't it?
One always sweats the big drop on the morning of an afternoon.
They used to crowd into my dressing room, too, when I was dressing... like a wake before one's dead.
Garabato.
I wouldn't admit this to anyone else in the world... but always when I'm dressing like this... there's a feel of rust in my throat.
The taste of death.
Fear.
But it's gone when I step into the arena.
The minute I hear the music, the yell of the crowd, it's all right again.
Chiquillo.
- How do you feel?
- Good as bread.
- And you?
- Oh, I wish it were this time tomorrow.
You've gotta learn not to worry.
Please let me worry just a little bit.
Makes me feel better.
You wouldn't worry if you'd heard what Curro just said about me.
"At last, Sevilla has a matador," he said.
My jacket.
"The greatest matador in history," he said.
I've kept my promise, haven't I?
My montera.
He said I was the first man of the world.
That makes you the first lady.
Well, how do I look?
Like a king.
Or a little boy all dressed up for a party.
Somehow, I feel this is gonna be a great afternoon.
I wish you were gonna be there with me.
I'm always with you, Juan.
Carmen, what do you do with yourself when I'm in the ring?
I pray to La Macarena every second... and every second is an hour.
When the sun begins to go down, l-I look up the street, and there's no Juan.
My heart stops beating.
But then I hear cheers and I see people running and I know it's Juan—
Juan coming home— and my heart starts beating again like a drum.
You're the only true one in the world.
Now, go.
[Door Closes]
[Praying, Indistinct]
- [Door Opens]

And here, mon ami, is where the espadas come... to offer their devotions and seek protection of the saints.
Does it save them from being gored by the bulls?
Sometimes.
There's no guarantee, not even from the saints.
Who is that?
I don't know. A new one.

I, Curro, say it.
I see she's back from Paris.
- Who is she?
- Dona Sol de Miura.
What I could tell you about that one would fill a whole book— several books.
If this is death in the afternoon... she is death in the evening.

- Oh, some gachi.
- Who?
I don't know what her name was.
I never saw her before.
- Then why did you dedicate it?
- She was with a party of swells... and it pays to keep in with people of that kind.
- She threw me some flowers.
- I hate her.
Was she pretty?
Mmm, not bad.
Prettier than me?
That's impossible.
Then I don't hate her anymore.
Still, she, uh— she wasn't so bad.
- Blue eyes and, uh—
- I don't like her.
- But too skinny.
- I guess she's all right.
Come on, now. Eat your breakfast.
Do you know you came home last night without your montera?
- Did I?
- Mm-hmm. What became of it?
I don't know.
I must've left it somewhere.
Come in.
- A messenger just brought this note for el matador.
- Thank you.
- Will you read it for me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Who's it from?
- Well, there's no signature, but... it's from a woman.
Oh, well, then tear it up.
Oh. It's from the woman you dedicated the bull to.
What's it say?
"Senor Juan Gallardo, thank you for
dedicating the first bull to me yesterday.
"If you want back the montera you threw me...
"you may have it by calling for it tonight at 8:00.
The address is Number Four,
Plaza de Alfaro."
- Your montera.
- Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, it all comes back to me now.
I threw the gachi my hat, and she refused to part with it.
She seems willing now.
Well, if she thinks I'm gonna call for it, she'll grow old waiting.
Oh. Why shouldn't you call for it?
She must be somebody of great importance if she lives at the Plaza de Alfaro.
Number Four.
That's where the Marques de Miura lives.
She must be his niece.
What does she look like?
I don't remember. Just a woman.
Well, if she's just a woman, why don't you wanna go?
Let's not argue about it.
I'm not going.
- You're not?
- No.
- Oh, I'm glad.
- Glad? A moment ago, you were just saying—
As long as you don't want to go, you can go.
Give me that note.
Now, run and get the papers and read me the notices.
All right.
- Mmm. What are these?
- Potatoes.
They're so small.
They're good though.
Not as good as gazpacho.
- You ever eat that?
- [Laughter]
- I don't think so.
- I was raised on it.
Really? How is it made?
Well, you take biscuits and oil and vinegar... and some, um, onions and garlic... and you, uh— and bread crumbs— and you fry 'em all together in a pan.
Then you throw them all in a pot— gazpacho.
- Sounds lovely.
- You oughta try it sometime.
- I will.
- Dona Sol likes to try everything.
Yeah, me too.
If I were a man, I'd try bullfighting.
There's nothing more exciting.
Oh, this is fine meat. What is it?
- Pheasant.
- I could eat a dozen of'em.
You know, when I retire,
I'm gonna raise pheasants and bulls.
[Laughter]
Senor, may I ask what brand of perfume you use?
[Sniffing]
I-I forget the name of it, but it's the most expensive there is.
It's certainly the strongest. But since you
spend most of your time with horses and bulls—
I like the smell of horses and bulls.
Well, if, uh, we want to hear Galli, we'll have to hurry.
Senor Gallardo, I hope you'll join us.
- Where are you going?
- Tito Galli, the Italian tenor, is a friend of Dona Sol's.
He's giving a concert, and if you'd care to go—
No, thank you. Not me.
I'm afraid I'll have to beg out too.
One of my nasty headaches.
Oh. That's too bad.
- I hope you feel better soon.
- Thank you.
Please explain to Tito.
He'll understand.
I'm sure he will. We all do.
I am so sorry about your headache.
- I'm sure you'll take something for it, won't you?
- Yes, of course.
Well, good night.
- Or is it good-bye?
- Pierre, why do you say that?
In the army, we learn many signal calls... including retreat.
- Thank you, Pierre.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye.
If I want you, I'll call.
- How's your headache?
- Better, thank you.
Hmm. Well, I—
Please sit down.
I must say, senora, that's the best meal I've ever eaten.
It's the least I can give you for an afternoon of great emotion.
You followed your star yesterday.
You were inspired.
Mmm. Who wouldn't be inspired?
I'd seen you.
I wasn't bad, was I?
Would you like to play chess?
No, thanks.
I'm much too comfortable.
Matter of fact,
I don't know how to play chess.
Matter of fact, I'm the most ignorant man in the world except with bulls.
I'm glad you decided not to go to the concert.
So am I.
Perhaps we can have a concert of our own.
- You play something?
- The guitar, a little.
Do you like music?
[Exhales]
Some music, yes.
The first music I remember was the clanging of the bells... that hung from the necks of the cabestros when they led the herd.
And l— I loved the singing of the vaqueros
on the ranch of your uncle, the marquis.
I love the music of the gypsies in the Café la Veronica.
##[Playing Chords]

[Bell Chiming]
- Juanillo.
- Put it on. Let's see how it looks on you.
- Here.
- Oh, that's beautiful!
Oh, that's too gorgeous for words.
I looked all over Sevilla for it.
I wanted to give you something especially fine.
But why, dear? What's happened?
Why did you get this for me?
Because, querida, you're the only true one in the world.
¡Ajá, toro!
If you want to know why he spends all his time at the Plaza Alfaro... it's because he has nothing to keep him at home.
He goes to another woman because his own woman is nothing. Nothing!
Perhaps if you'd give him a son or two—
- Encarnacion!
- You can say anything you like about me... but I won't hear one word against Juan— not a word.
If he'd only take my advice.
Where is his gratitude after all I've done for him?
Just what have you done for him?
- What has he done for me?
- Why, everything.
He set you up in business.
He lets you live in his house.
Who says it's his house?
He and his fine gestures!
Buys a house and doesn't pay for it.
Well, mark my words, one fine day we'll all be thrown out.
He's no good in the ring anymore.
He's afraid of a scratch!
It might interfere with his evenings.
He neglects you, his family, his friends.
He makes a fool ofhimself.
[Encarnacion]
He's a lazy, drunken, worthless—
You rotten little worms.
You aren't fit to mention his name.
You ingrates! Hypocrites! Maggots!
He gave you everything you have!
He supports you and your children!
He shares everything he has, and you— behind his back, you sneer at him and criticize!
You pick at him like vultures!
I can't stand it in this house any longer.
I'm going away.
No, Carmen, no. You'll stay.
You'll stay with Juan until the end.
The end?
Tell me, on those days when Juan goes to the ring... to whom do you pray?
To Our Lady of Hope, La Macarena.
What do you ask La Macarena?
I ask that she watch over our Juan and keep him safe from any hurt.
So I used to pray for his father.
It was no good.
In the end, it was no good.
The Virgin— She's only a woman.
And women can do so little.
Now I pray to a man God—
Jesus of great power.
What I ask is something different.
Madre, what do you ask for?
I pray to him to let my son be gored in the ring.
Not to die, but to be hurt... so he may cheat the end which every torero meets.
Yes, that's what I pray for.
And I pray to him not to send you a son... for he'll only grow up to torment you... and let you die every Sunday afternoon... just as you are dying now.
[Thinking]
Dear Lady of Good Hope... please watch over my husband, Juan.
[Woman's Voice]
He'll be safe and sound, my child.
And if you see fit, please put in his heart a wish to retire from the bull ring.
That, too, when the time comes.
And one thing more, Macarena... and this is what I really came to see you about.
I know what it is.
I can read it in your heart.
It's been there a long time, and you've held it back... even from me.
Why, I didn't mean to.
Really, I didn't.
It's just that I didn't want to hurt Juan.
But I've got to do something.
I can't go on living like this.
Dear Macarena, help me.
Please help me.
Tell me what to do about that woman.
That woman—
- [Clicks Heels]
- ¡Ajá, toro!
- [Clicks Heels]
- ¡Ajá, toro!
- [Clicks Heels]
- ¡Ajá, ajá, toro!
That's good. Very good.
¡Ajá, toro!
[Bells Ringing]
Excuse me, Juanillo.
Senora Gallardo to see you.
Have her come in.
I came to see you on the advice of a friend.
Yes? Please be seated.
Thank you.
Senora Gallardo, is there anything I can offer you?
Yes. My husband.
Oh?
Please believe me.
I came here in no spirit of rancor.
I'm not here to judge.
I can understand your being interested in my husband.
He's the first man in Spain, the greatest in his profession.
- Naturally, all women run after him.
- Naturally.
I can understand his interest in you too... especially now that I see how beautiful you are.
Thank you.
Perhaps it's my fault.
Perhaps if I were more beautiful... better educated and of a better family.
I know of your family. Your father works for my uncle on the ranch, I believe.
Yes, he's the overseer there.
All my life I've heard about you.
What have you heard?
- Shall I be frank?
- Please do.
I've heard that you've been all over the world... that you speak many languages... and that you've known a great many men.
Go on.
I've never been out of Andalucía...
I speak only one language... and I've had only one man.
Maybe that's why
I want so much to keep him.
Tell me, have you discussed this with Juan?
- No.
- Why not?
It would hurt him.
Just a minute, please.
- [Clicks Heels]
- ¡Ajá, toro!
##[Dona Sol Singing In Spanish]

[Door Closes]
[Coughing]
Garabato!
Garabato!
Oh, good morning, Madrecita.
Good afternoon, my son.
- Where's Garabato?
- He's gone.
- Gone?
- You let him go last night.
Don't you remember?
Oh, yes. Yes, we had a row about something he did.
- What was it?
- He asked for his wages.
You haven't paid him in months.
He had an offer from Manolo de Palma.
Well, that's fine.
I picked him up when he was a beggar.
I took him when nobody else would have him, and now he leaves me.
Why wasn't he paid?
Why didn't Don Jose attend to it?
I don't know.
The only people who come to the house these days... are tradesmen with unpaid bills— shoemakers, tailors, dozens of others.
I don't understand it. The more money
I make, the less I seem to have.
- It melts away before I ever see it.
- Yes.
One can't build on sand.
[Phone Rings]
I'll answer it.
[Door Opens]
- Good afternoon, Juanillo.
- Don Jose.
I've been in the country, over at the ranch.
There's something
I want to talk over with you.
Well, uh, make yourself comfortable.
How is everything at the ranch?
- I saw Carmen.
- How is she?
It's a great pity that one so young should be already finished with life.
But that's what happens when you have only one thing in life and you lose it.
Let's not talk about that.
But we've got to talk about it.
That's what I came here for.
What's the use? She had a right to leave, and she left. That's all there is to it.
Is it? Did you want her to leave?
No.
Do you still love her?
- Yes.
- And the other one?
That's an entirely different thing.
Juan, listen to me. I've known both of these women ever since they were children.
I'm sorry for Carmen, and I pity Dona Sol.
Why should you pity her?
Because there's nothing in the world that she can hold on to for long. Nothing.
When she was a little girl,
she used to tire of all her toys... and throw them away while they were still new.
- Now, my advice to you—
- Don Jose, you're my manager... and I'm willing to take your advice on matters of business.
But in personal matters,
I don't have to listen to you!
Why don't you leave me alone and stop interfering with me!
Maybe I don't know how to read or write, but this I do know—
I've made tons of money, and what's become of it?
I've never had an accounting from you or that thieving Lopez either.
- From me?
- Senor Lopez.
You've always wanted to be your brother-in-law's manager.
As far as I'm concerned, you may have that honor from this moment on.
And I can tell you this:
If you sign any contracts for him, he'll be taking money under false pretenses.
And here's some bills you'd better pay, if you can find the money.
Well, now as my manager, it'll be much easier for you to rob me.
Do you think I'd let my husband have anything to do with you?
To be a manager, one must have something to manage! And what are you? Nothing!
- Encarnacion.
- Your money—You've spent it, thrown it away!
You haven't even paid
for the house you live in!
And we're not going to live
in it anymore either!
We're not going to get soiled
in the scandal that drove your wife away!
I understand.
They say that when a ship is sinking, all the rats leave.
Good-bye, rats!
But you're mistaken if you think I'm sinking.
Well, what are you waiting for?
[Curro's Voice]
Rejoice, ye faithful.
At last, Sevilla has a matador.
The greatest matador of all history.
A saint.
The first man of the world.
The day he was born,
there was salt in the air.
A great quantity of salt.
[Laughing]
Well, what can you expect from a herd... that, for the most part, can't read or write?
They enjoy the pleasure of a tragic emotion... without the slightest danger to themselves.
They scream with a lust for blood.
As for the people who sit in the shade... at least they can afford it.
But the citizens of the sun, they pay five pesetas— a whole day's pay, enough to feed a family— to fry on the sunny side of the ring... while they watch a few bulls being butchered— a criminal business.
If it's a criminal business, Nacional, why are you still in it?
The truth of the matter is that Juan Gallardo owes me practically a year's pay.
As soon as I can collect my back wages...
I'm going to quit this repulsive trade forever.
I swear this is my last season.
You fool! Stop dousing me with that stinking stuff!
I only did it to kill the smell of rum on your breath.
Well, I'll thank you to mind your own business.
I know what you're up to.
- If you're looking for an excuse to quit me, say so.
- Why, I wouldn't quit you.
But it isn't right for you to fill yourself with rum on the day of a corrida.
You don't have to worry about the bulls this afternoon. We drew a couple of bravos.
It's not the bulls. It's the crowd.
They're waiting for me with claws.
The crowd is forgetful, Juanillo, like a woman.
And fickle like a woman, and cruel like a woman.
- Shut your mouth.
- But this time you can't blame the crowd.
You aren't giving them anything.
Well, I've— I've had bad luck.
The bulls have been much bigger.
They only seem bigger because when you face them, you're afraid.
You were born to very little like the rest of us... but one thing you had that was real and pure— you were a born killer of bulls, a matador!
She took it away from you.
Now when you face the bull with a sword, you're drained, empty.
There's nothing left of you but fear.
You have a gun, haven't you?
Why don't you bring it to the ring with you... and kill the beast with a bullet?
[Crowd Shouting]
[Gasping, Shouting]
[Crowd Booing]
I've dragged myself... through the blood and sand... of a thousand arenas.
In the end... there's only one thing I regret—
I never learned... to read or write.
I was obliged... to renounce education... but I make the whole world responsible... for my ignorance.
Your cornada was meant for me.
What?
We've always shared everything, haven't we?
Life is very curious.
There's no remedy.
If it were all to do over—
Amigo... there are some things you can't stop... not even with a cape.
Well, I'm quitting.
This is my last season.
- Olé!
- [Cheering]
- [Chattering]
- "And I end by heralding the news...
"of a new comet flashing across the horizon— a bright and flashing comet— and his name is Manolo de Palma."
Olé.
"Aficionados, mark well that name.
It is destined for great glory."
- Curro wrote it himself, huh?
- He signed it.
You'll be famous! Wonderful!
- [All Chattering]
- Don't leave. Oh, Manolo.
- [Chattering]
- Aw, quiet!
- Senor Curro.
- Manolo.
I've just been reading the piece you wrote about me. It's very flattering.
Not at all, Manolo. It is my honest opinion.
Sit down, my friend.
Sit down. Will you do me the honor of having some wine with me?
No, you must do me the honor.
[Speaking Spanish]
Curro, what is a comet?
A comet, my friend, is a star... that flashes across the sky... lighting up the heavens with its fiery brilliance and then—
Yes?
Good evening, Don Juan.
Good evening, senora.
This way, if you please.
[Chattering]
- What will you have?
- What will you have?
- Champagne.
- Champagne.
- Champagne?
- Sí, champagne.
Champagne.
It's a nice place.
I'm glad we came here.
What is it, Juan?
I was just trying to figure out what kind of a woman you are.
Yes?
The trouble is you're—you're not one woman... but many... and never the same.
Well, one changes, you know.
Why didn't you come to see me at the corrida last Sunday?
I had a headache.
A headache?
Samson and Delilah.
- What?
- Nothing.
Excuse me.
Greetings, compañero.
Pardon me for intruding, Juanillo... but this is as good a time as any to keep your promise.
- What promise?
- Why, to present me to Dona Sol.
Don't you remember? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Manolo de Palma.
I shall have the pleasure soon
of appearing in the ring here in Sevilla.
How nice. I shall look forward to it.
I understand Juan will be in the same corrida.
Yes, it'll be the first time we appear together.
You'll have a chance to compare our styles.
We work altogether differently.
- How have you been, amigo?
- Well, thank you.
- How's your mother?
- Nicely.
How's your sister and Antonio Lopez and the children?
- They're all fine. Thank you.
- And how's your little wife?
Oh, yes, I hear she's gone off to the ranch with her father.
[Chuckles] You know, Dona Sol,
Juan and I are old friends.
His mother used to work here.
We used to live right around the corner.
We ran away together
with some other boys.
Hey, Juan, remember that horse we stole?
Remember what happened to it?
- What happened?
- We ate the horse.
You did? How did it taste?
Excellent.
Ah, those were good days.
We'd spend all our time fighting the bulls and each other.
We were great rivals, even then.

Camarero, a new glass!
What are you doing?
It's well to keep in practice.
What are you talking about?
When we left Triana, I asked Francisco to keep my old job open for me.
I knew someday I'd come back to La Veronica to scrub the floors.
Get up. Get up!
Suppose someone should see you.
There is no one left in the house to see me but you.
I don't like to see you on your knees like this.
What's wrong with my being on my knees?
That's how I pray and that's how I work.
This house was clean when we moved in.
Let it be clean when we move out.
Why must you always talk about moving out?
Because we've got to leave this house tomorrow.
Oh! Oh, Juan.
Juan, when you were little, you wouldn't listen to me.
Will you listen to me now?
What do you want?
I want you to quit the bull ring.
Quit? When I'm at the top?
I've been through all this before.
I know what to expect.
When you reach the top, you begin to slip.
There is only one way you can possibly go, and that's down.
Oh, Madrecita, you talk just like all the rest.
Just because
I've had a few poor afternoons... some bad luck, you think I'm finished.
But you're wrong. They all are.
I'm just as good as I ever was— even better— because now I know more.
Supposing we do have to move out of this house.
I'll buy you another one— much better... the best that money can buy and in the finest part of town.
Right on the Plaza Alfaro, that's where we'll live.
And I'll buy a ranch, and we'll breed bulls and pheasants.
Juanillo, niño mio... what's wrong with your hand?
My hand?
##[Band Playing]
[Speaking Spanish]
I understand Gallardo has one more contract to fulfill— the corrida next Sunday afternoon.
I predict he will make his exit... in a cloud of rotten oranges and dead cats.
I hold him directly responsible for the death of Nacional... and I shall say so in my article tomorrow.
The trouble with Gallardo is he has cats in his belly.
His father was the same way.
Like father, like son.
That's the second time you've said things about my father.
As for you, you've probably never been baptized.
I'll baptize you now.
I christen you "liar," and your second name is "swine."
[Gasping, Panting]
Father, his face—
Reminds me of Nacional's
just before he died from the cornada.
Yes, my son.
You were here?
I'm always here whenever you fight.
You mean all these weeks since you left me?
I never left you, Juan.
I've just been waiting for you— waiting for this sickness to pass.
Just a minute ago
I was praying to see you.
I was thinking if you could love me again—
Oh, Juanillo, I do love you.
I always have and I always will.
Nothing has changed that.
Nothing can. Nothing ever.
Oh.
Oh, Carmencita... when I hold you in my arms like this,
I'm born again.
You give me strength.
I can do anything.
Oh, I— I'm so glad you're wearing your white suit.
It's the one I like best.
No, you don't. You hate it.
Like my mother does.
You hate them all.
But this is the last time
I'm ever going to wear one.
I'm through with the ring forever.
Oh, Juan. Juanillo.
[Sobbing]
This is my last afternoon out there... but it'll be one they'll never forget.
You'll see. They'll see, everyone.
##[Fanfare]

And now there'll be money to take care of my mother... and enough left over for— for us to buy a little ranch.

I wouldn't want a big place.

[Crowd Cheering]
Just a little patch.
Somewhere in the country, hmm?
And you—you'll teach me how to read and write.
[Crowd Cheering]
And then on Sundays, we'll get dressed up in our best.
Go to breakfast at— at some little inn.

Oh, Juanillo, dear, does it hurt much?
Not a bit.

He'll always be just as I first saw him— just a little boy... with fire and valor.

God be thanked in his heaven.

A poor haul, but an easy one.
We'll do ourselves better in Maracaibo.
What are you moping about?
Here. Drink this.
No?
It was an easy scuffle, Jamie-Boy.
Aye, it was.
Hey, what are you rubbing your nose for?
- I'm thinking on something.
- Out with it!
They're hanging Captain
Morgan this week... hanging him on the docks in London.
- That's what I'm thinking on.
- Anybody lets himself get... caught and hung is nobody to drink to.
To Captain Morgan, I say!
Hanging or walking, he's a better man than the pack of us.
Give me that comb.
Let go of that, you! Blast it!
I must drink to this occasion,
Captain Waring.
We are not often honored by such a distinguished visitor.
What a magnificent record.
Second in command to Henry Morgan... in the raid on Panama... the sack of Maracaibo,
Portobelo, Trujillo!
Quite a busy little cutthroat we have here.
But there is no mention of you at the attack on Granada.
I was there... killing Spaniards.
The English dog still barks! Is your memory improving?
Have you remembered where...
- Captain Morgan is?
- Perfectly.
- Where is he?
- In England.
You lie.
I grant you England is where he should be... hanging from a gibbet with the rest of you scum of the sea!
But I have word from our ambassador... that he escaped.
Your news delights me, Don Miguel.
Oh. And perhaps this will delight you too.
A quarter of a turn!
Where were you planning to meet Morgan?
On the far side of the moon.
Where is his ship?
Hull down and sailing through your whiskers, Don Miguel.
A full turn!
Speak, you devil spawn, before I quarter you!
- What is that?
- The devil looking after his own.
Easy, my brave bag of wind!
Tommy Blue! Welcome to Corrientes!
Be with you in a minute,
Captain Jamie.
Hand over that sticker while I'm... in this loving mood. March!
Ho-ho! You're outnumbered.
Me and Jamie... could outnumber your whole empire!
Take those stickers away before they hurt themselves!
Came into the harbor to get a barrel of water... and says to a fellow, says I...
"How's me old friend Don Miguel?"
"Well," says he, "the noble Spaniard is entertaining people."
"Who?" says I."Well, among his guests," says he, "is Jamie Waring."
"Well," says I, "that's a party
I've got to attend."
- So up we came.
- Ah. I'll thank you later.
But tell me, Tommy, who's with you?
- How many ships have you got?
- Oh, two pretties, Jamie.
The second one's tacking in, but let me tell you the good news first!
Never mind the news. Get me that bottle of wine.
- Huh? Oh.
- Quick.
There's nothing like a stretch on the rack to raise a thirst.
Would you want to be laying down a minute, Jamie?
No.
Keep a clear head, Tommy.
We've got work to do...
Nice, pleasant work.
I'm a better man drunk than sober for any kind of work!
You were admiring my bark,
Don Miguel.
- We'll see how you like my bite.
- But I'm unarmed.
It's lucky you are. If you had a sword in your hand... you'd be dead by now and stiffer than the devil's tail.
Give me a hand! Put him on the rack!
- Here.
- Move! Get a move on!
Go on!
Have mercy, senor! What are you going to do now?
I'm eager to return your hospitality, Don Miguel.
- On the rack!
- Oh, no, no. Please, no.
You'll hang for this! You'll hang for this, all of you.
Your English governor...
In the name of God, let me go!
Let me go!
- Lord Denby! Lord Denby!
- A musical fellow, ain't he?
Your bark, Don Miguel, is a little louder than mine.
Turn the wheel, my lads.
What say the poets? "One good turn deserves another."
Stop that, you bloody thieves!
Unchain this man! I command you in the name of King Charles.
And who may you be, you bellowing rabbit?
I'm Lord Denby, governor of Jamaica.
Oh, Lord Denby.
You're the gentleman who brought
Captain Morgan to trial.
I'm delighted to meet you.
And I'll see you hanging on Wapping
Executional Dock beside him.
- I'm laughing me sides out!
- March out, you renegade louts!
Renegade! You yellow turncoat!
Befriending the Spanish and hanging your own countrymen!
Lay down your arms!
England and Spain... are at peace. A treaty has been signed.
Where was it signed, Lord Denby, on that rack?
Men, here's a rope-maker for your necks... the little English hangman from Jamaica.
Up the rope he goes!
Up he goes.
Oh, I'm glad to see Jamie is here.
- Give me a rope, somebody!
- No, no, Tommy.
- No rope for him.
- Oh, let me hang him, Jamie.
No. The rope's for gentlemen with brave hearts.
The vault's the place for this English traitor.
Lock him away with all his
Spanish friends.
You'll hang, all of you!
March him off! Chain him to the wall!
Let him rot in the Spanish damp.
You sea rats! I command you in His Majesty's name!
Your commanding days are over, my lord.
I'm laughing me sides out!
Put away that bottle, Tommy.
There's treasure to load.
This is a ripe and juicy castle.
Here, you guzzler! Take this!
Make yourself a pretty pair of drawers!
Two ships, you said, huh? We can load 'em both from this castle... and sail for Maracaibo!
Gut the whole Spanish Main strip it and leave it like a... horse's skull on the desert.
Look at him.
Look at him.
He's fainted.
Or is he just bored with our presence?
- Close your eyes, Don Miguel.
- Father!
- The devil's asking for you.
- Father?
Where's my father?
The captain's share, gentlemen.
I bespeak it.
Where is he?
Stay away or I'll shoot! I'm
Lord Denby's daughter.
Ohhh. This is a windfall.
Lady Margaret, eh?
- Who are you?
- A sea rat... a bit of ocean scum doing
His Majesty's dirty work... killing the Spaniards to make room for... fat Englishmen and their nasty daughters.
Waring is my name, but those who... love me call me Jamie-Boy.
I'm not afraid of you gallows dancers.
"Gallows dancers"? A pretty phrase, milady.
Yes. I've seen your kind dancing in the wind... with their necks stretched like a lot of geese flying.
And I'll see you that way too!
Where's my father? Tell me or I'll shoot.
Your father is ornamenting a dungeon wall, milady.
But you'll forget about him as soon as you learn to... call me Jamie-Boy.
Let go of me, you brute!
I always sample a bottle of wine before I buy it.
Let's have a sip, see if you're worth taking along.
Oh! You wench! Bite me, will you?
Strike me blind! It's a ghost.
- Hello, Jamie-Boy.
- Captain Morgan!
Don't stand there gaping like a halibut on a pier.
Henry! What in the name of thunder?
- So you weren't hanged!
- Not successfully.
You escaped!
No. A king's pardon and more.
I'm swooning like a bride.
I was telling you,
Jamie, I had news for you.
Aye, a packet of news it is, me boy.
Now put your shirt on. You look much too naked for a decent Englishman.
And now find me my great admirer... the so-called governor of Jamaica.
And if this sad little wench be his daughter, fetch her... some smelling salts.
And you, Tom Blue, tell all me old captains... to meet me tonight at the Porker's Sterne.
Aye.
- But I...
- Jamie-Boy, I got a lot to tell you.
Silence!
Now listen to me.
If there's anybody wants to tell me different... let him stand up and get his head broke in.
I say Captain Morgan's a king's spy.
He bought his life by offering to put all... his old cronies on the end of a rope.
I say Morgan's a yellow dog!
Now, wait there, Captain Leech.
We ought to hear what...
Morgan's got to say.
Are you calling me a liar?
No, but I'm saying we oughta hear Morgan out.
And nobody's calling me a liar.
Now, then, anybody else want their head broke in?
I say Captain Morgan's a two-faced cur with the king's brand on him.
And I say Captain Leech is a gibbering ape... fit only for the company of baboons.
Ah, gentlemen, Captain Leech is in a temper.
Aha! Morgan's fetch-and-carry.
Don't cross with him, Jamie. You're too drunk to do yourself justice.
- A little room, please.
- I always wanted to cut that... oily tongue out of you.
Leech! Jamie! Stop it!
Stop it, you lubbers! Stop or
I'll blast the both of you!
I told you he was coming!
Sit down, you two.
Over there, Captain Leech.
Your seat, Captain Waring.
Ale for all hands, Barney... and keep it pouring till we're all drowned.
Gentlemen, I am delighted to see you all still alive and kicking.
You were all my captains once... and I have called you together to know if you will still follow me.
Where to? The gallows at
100 guineas a head?
Your head, Captain Leech... were it filled with gold instead of slops, wouldn't fetch that.
Gentlemen...
I have come from England with an offer from...
His Majesty King Charles.
A king's pardon and a hundred acres of land... to each of you who will settle down ashore... or take your ships into peaceful trade.
Oh, they'll clap us in jail the minute we dump... our cannon.
It's a trick.
And who's going to give us the hundred acres of land?
- The new governor of Jamaica.
- The new governor?
- And who is the new governor?
- Henry Morgan...
Sir Henry Morgan... knighted by His Majesty and assigned the island of Jamaica for his ruling.
I said it before and I say it again.
A king's spy.
No, Captain Leech. A king's right arm in the Caribbean... and a strong one.
Gentlemen, England has signed a peace with Spain...
The long fight is over.
It's a trick.
Spain wants a breathing spell from our attacks... so she can strengthen her forces here.
- Quiet, Jamie.
- It's a scurvy trick, I say!
Sit down!
They'll bring over armies and ships to murder us if we... give them peace.
- Aye, they will.
- Quiet, you bubbleheads!
The privateers are done for.
They're in the past.
They must give way now to progress and the making of... law-abiding colonies.
England wants peace and time to build her empire.
Will you join me for that,
Brother Leech?
I sailed the Main with you, Morgan... and if you're crawling under the king's flag...
I'll keep sailing it without you!
- Who's coming along to Maracaibo?
- There's a lot of gold in Maracaibo.
As governor of Jamaica, I make my first pronouncement.
I'll run every pirate and privateer into the bottom of the Caribbean.
I give those of you who don't join me... a month to clear out of
English waters.
My ship, the Black Swan, don't drop... her sails for any king's spy.
That's my answer to you,
Captain Morgan.
And if any of you yellow-livers get the blood... back in you, I'll lead you against Maracaibo!
Who's coming with me?
- I, sir!
- And I, sir!
Jamie Waring. Come on, Jamie-Boy.
He's got the king, but we've got the wind on our side.
And a captain's share of Maracaibo.
Get down, you drunken fool. You're my second in command.
Hey, Barney. More ale for
Captain Waring.
- Aye, sir.
- Gentlemen, to Captain Waring... my loyal right hand at
Government House.
Come on, Jamie. You were never meant to suck your thumb in a king's collar.
- We'll get you a new ship.
- To Jamie Waring!
May his neck never grow longer!
The occasion seems a little lacking in enthusiasm, Henry.
I imagined we'd meet with some slight disapproval.
At least we don't have to shoot our way in.
Whom do you wish to see?
We are waiting upon Lord Denby.
His lordship is busy, sir.
He'll be busier in a few minutes.
Mr. Ingram, these gentlemen are waiting upon his lordship.
- Gentlemen?
- I am Sir Henry Morgan.
From the looks of you, it could be nothing else.
Your Excellency, there are some gentlemen here... with muddy boots.
I have removed all my effects.
The premises are at your disposal for looting or burning.
I can appreciate your discomfort, milord.
It's not pleasant having a man you tried... to hang return as your superior.
But for the sake of the empire we both serve...
I am willing to forget your distaste of me.
The ceremony making you official governor will take place tomorrow.
I shall perform all duties required... of me as an officer of the Crown.
But my personal life is my own, sir.
It does not include associating with blackguards.
Well, Sir Henry, do we run him through hang him... from the yardarm... or start dancing the minuet?
Being governor is going to require some restraint.
There's always Maracaibo.
Get to your quarters, you blockheads! Both of you!
- What quarters, sir?
- How do I know? Find them!
Take any rooms you want.
- No, you don't! That's mine!
- I saw it first!
Oh, no, sir! No, sir!
Don't kill me! Don't kill me.
Is going. Is going.
- Pick that up.
- Yes, massa. Yes, sir.
- Pick it up!
- Yes, sir. Oh, you...
You is one of them pirates, is you?
Or... Or ain't you?
- What do I look like?
- Yes. I mean, no, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, nothing, sir. Just going... going fast.
- Stealing, eh?
- Oh, no, sir.
I was just looking for a locket that belonged to Miss Margaret.
- But it ain't here, sir. It ain't here.
- This is Lady Margaret's room?
Yes, sir.
How's her bed? Soft enough for me?
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
"And 10th, we do hereby give and grant unto Sir Henry Morgan...
"full power and authority to...
"levy, arm, muster...
"command and employ all persons whatsoever...
"residing within our said colony of Jamaica,
"to march from one place to another or to embark them...
"for the resisting and withstanding of all enemies...
"pirates and rebels, both at sea and land.
"Given at our court at Whitehall...
"the sixth day of November, 1674...
"in the 16th year of our reign.
- "God save the king."
- God save the king.
"We, duly elected to the Assembly...
"by all the peoples of Jamaica...
"renew our pledge of fealty to his most gracious...
"Majesty King Charles II...
"through the person of his appointed representative...
"His Excellency, the governor of
Jamaica, Sir Henry Morgan."
"Almighty and everlasting God...
"creator and governor of all the world...
"by whom kings do bear rule...
"and under whose providence they are wonderfully...
"and mightily...
"often times protected from many fearful dangers...
"by which the malice of Satan and his...
"imps do seek to entrap them.
"We give unto thy heavenly majesty most...
"humble and hearty thanks.
"For that it hath pleased thee of thine infinite...
"mercy and goodness in Jesus
Christ...
"so wonderfully to uphold" '...
Whew. That was the longest, dullest ceremony I ever heard.
I don't blame you for walking out.
You can lower your pistols,
Lady Margaret.
Unfortunately, I have no pistols.
Your eyes I've looked into pistol barrels that are kinder.
- Get out of my way.
- Please, do me a favor and... don't make me angry.
I'm trying my hardest to behave like a gentleman.
- A gentleman?
- Well, perhaps not entirely.
I only meant that my new character keeps me from seizing women... and hugging and squeezing them into submission.
Instead, I... I woo them with politeness... and with gifts.
Here.
Where did you get this?
I found it in your bed.
- You have my room?
- Yes.
And you haunt it sweetly each night.
Not an evening passes but I find some... new and fascinating souvenir of you... a stocking, a garter, a bit of lace.
In Tortuga, when a woman slaps a man's face... it means she wants him to grab her... overpower her and smother her with kisses.
I understand in Jamaica a gentleman must refuse such overtures.
- Out of my way.
- You're much too angry for... public appearance.
Give me your arm. A turn around the garden will cool you off.
I promise not to kiss you unless you ask for it like a lady.
Roger. Roger.
Oh. The idiot whose face I took the liberty of removing... from your locket.
Darling, I've been hunting everywhere for you.
Take me home, please.
- Has this fellow been insulting you?
- Yes.
Oh, the hero to the rescue.
It's time one of you lackeys was taught a lesson.
No, I'm under oath as a gentleman not to kill any tame rabbits.
- I'll have you for that.
- Leave the coward alone, Roger.
No, I'm going to make an example of him.
I'll run him through as a common thief.
Oath or no oath, you'll have to learn... not to offend your betters, Ingram.
Now, tell me, what the devil do you see in this weasel?
Oh, darling are you hurt?
I'm sorry. It was all my fault.
If you're in love with him, you're too big a fool for a... man like me.
You black-hearted bully.
What do you know about men or women or anything human?
All you can do is shoot and kill and prey on women... with your beastly senses slobbering at the sight of anything fine.
I repeat, my lass, you'll have to choose... between us and very soon too.
There you are, my beauty.
Seeing is believing.
Made for a queen, it was.
And easy to accommodate five... if you'll sleep them crosswise.
Come on. Get that albatross out of here.
Now, hold your fire, Jamie-Boy.
I promised her she could spend the night... in the governor's daughter's bed.
Get back to your trough, both of you.
I never thought I'd live to see
Jamie Waring play the snob.
- Get out.
- Why, Jamie...
It's a heart of stone you got!
Jamie, open the door!
She's crying her head off.
Jamie, she's crying like a baby.
Massa, does you want to put your head on this?
- What's that?
- It's a pillow, massa.
Lady Margaret's own little pillow.
She always sleeps on it.
Then take it out and burn it up.
- Yes, massa.
- Wait a minute.
Never mind.
- That's all.
- Yes, massa.
Sweet dreams, massa.
- Good morning, milady.
- You're trespassing here.
This is my land.
I set my mind on having a friendly little talk with you this morning.
Are you all right?
Why didn't you fall on the horse instead of letting the... horse fall on you?
You'd think anybody's have sense enough for that.
- Let me down.
- Well, good morning.
You've put on a little weight, as I remember.
Put me down!
- Think you can stand?
- Yes. I'm quite all right.
Easy now. You'll only start a convulsion.
There's a cozy little spot.
There you are.
Oh! Oh, you see?
You're scuttled fore and aft.
I think I'll have to put you to bed.
What?
I suggest that you lie down for a spell.
Ah. There.
- You may go now.
- Oh, nonsense.
If the eyes fill with blood, it's a sign... the head's broken.
No, they're clear.
Although they seem a little brighter than usual.
Don't touch me.
Now, my gal, I'm an expert on broken heads.
I've seen thousands of them.
Couldn't have picked a better doctor in all Jamaica.
Oh, a fine, hard skull.
Couldn't crack it with a bung-starter.
Let's have a look at your ankle.
Go find my horse!
No gentleman would think of leaving a lady at a... moment like this.
Just lie still, please, and behave yourself.
This oughta teach you to be more sociable in the future.
No bones broken.
A muscle twisted.
- Does that hurt there?
- No.
Fetch me some water, please.
I feel faint.
You may have thrown your knee out.
I ought to investigate.
No! Go fetch me some water, please!
Well, that proves what
I've always said... a woman's place is not on a horse.
There. Now, my gal, I suggest that you stay like that... until your color comes back.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to enjoy your society.
You seem much nicer than I thought.
Really, it occurs to me you probably have... a mother somewhere... a nice, gentle, old lady.
- No, she died when I was a baby.
- Possibly a sister?
No, no, no. No kith or kin.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Is that why you... I mean, why you went to sea?
- Would you like to hear about me?
- Oh, of course I would.
Well, it's quite a story.
I haven't thought about it for a long time... but I'd like to tell it to you.
I was 14, living alone in London, when... the smell of the sea got a hold of me.
I was apprenticed to an old law firm.
You're sure I'm not boring you?
- Oh, no. Not at all.
- Well...
Roger. Roger!
I give you my word on this,
Captain Leech.
I'll get you news of every English treasure ship that sails... when it's leaving and the port it's making for.
It's a pretty offer, Mr. Ingram.
The nicest, prettiest offer
I ever had... if you ain't lying or setting a trap for me.
Judge for yourself. The
Prince Consort is... due at Port Royal in three days... carrying English gold.
It'll layover first at Port Lobos to disembark passengers.
Prince Consort, eh? How many guns?
Forty.
- No escort?
- None.
We've got two ships and a hundred guns.
We could chop her into kindling.
What are you asking for this tidy piece of news?
A captain's share.
You'll hand it over to
Mr. Fenner here.
When I receive it, he'll return to you with further information... government information.
I'll send you back in a week,
Fenner, smothered... in gold. Here you are, Mr. Ingram.
You're a dead man if you're fooling... me and a rich man if you ain't.
It's the Prince Consort, all right.
Give her a blast and we'll board her.
They were waiting for us on the award side of Point Lobos... three of them.
The Black Swan engaged us first.
We fought till we were ripped to ribbons.
We lost a 130 dead, 15 of them women.
And the gold gone, every box of it!
Gentlemen, this crime is fouler than you know.
There's not only murder here, but treachery.
Go on with your tale, Captain Blaine.
There are others who could tell it better, Your Excellency.
And who are they, milord?
The friends of Pirate Leech who supplied him with the news... of where to fall upon the
Prince Consort.
Mr. Speaker, honorable members...
Leech has many old friends in Jamaica... friends in high position.
There they are. Morgan, Waring,
Graham, Blue... the whole lot of them.
Who else makes the charge that I and... my captains are traitors to the Crown?
I do. Milords and gentlemen...
I say that so long as Morgan sits as governor... so long will English ships be fed to his pirate friends.
- I call for a vote of impeachment!
- I vote for that!
Quiet! You do not vote pirates off the seas.
You engage them, rake and scuttle them.
Milords and gentlemen, we have ships, brave captains and fine crews.
How do you stand on that, lads?
Are you ready to do a little law-abiding killing for... king and country?
- It's better than none!
- You sail tomorrow night... with three ships.
- Captain Waring, take the Revenge.
- Aye, sir.
You're in command of the expedition.
Captain Graham.
- Aye, sir.
- You take the Reckless.
- Captain Higgs.
- Aye, sir.
Sail the Lady Bess. There's no ship for you,
Tom Blue.
Aye, sir. I'll first-mate Jamie.
Good.
And now, my lads, will one of you take a look in your crystal globe... and tell these lords and gentlemen where... our old friend Leech is hiding?
Ha! I can see him as plain as the nose on your face, Sir Henry.
- Tortuga!
- Right!
- And what do you think, Graham?
- I say Tortuga.
We are of a mind. That's where he always went... when he was shining with gold.
I can see him plain, standing head down in a barrel of ale... and hollering for more women.
Bottle him up in Tortuga Harbor.
Sink him, my lads!
And wipe Leech and the black flag off the seas.
You can tell these lords and gentlemen... they can rest easy in their plush chairs, Sir Henry.
I'll bring you back a necklace made of his teeth.
I told you when I took office... that I would clean the Caribbean.
And clean it I will. And if I fail, you can start your voting then.
Get to your ships, my lads, and hoist your sails!
- Aye, sir!
- Aye, sir!
Milords and gentlemen, this sitting is adjourned.
- I sent for you two hours ago.
- I come as soon as I heard, sir.
They're sailing for Tortuga tonight... three ships.
- Can you get there ahead of them?
- Easy.
I can take the tide out in an hour.
Tell Leech to get out of Tortuga... and to wait for the Royal Treasurer off St. Thomas.
She's sailing for England in a few days.
And tell Leech I know just how much she's... carrying and not try skimping my share.
- Aye, sir.
- No, thank you.
- Get on! Stretch all your canvas.
- Aye, sir.
Sorry I was so long, Roger.
Who's that? He's been bothering you a great deal lately.
Nothing troublesome, I hope?
No. The fellow wants some government work.
I told him to try Morgan.
He looks like his kind.
Finished your shopping?
Oh, there's nothing to buy in all Jamaica.
Oh, Roger, that man can it be that he's following you?
I'm certain I've seen him before.
He has the most amusing notion.
He wants to be my valet.
A valet with one ear?
- Oh, he must be a lunatic.
- He is.
Oh, it's nothing against him.
The most famous valet in
London was a lunatic.
- Oh, Roger, you jest.
- No jest. Lord Londonry's valet.
It's a good thing you're not going to London.
Oh, it's a good thing I am.
Lady Margaret, I have melancholy news for you.
The proverbial aunt whom
I've never seen... has proverbially gone to her rest... and left me a rich man, a very rich man.
Can that be the reason why you've been so gay lately?
Yes. I'm afraid it hasn't grieved me properly... to know that I can have the finest estates...
I want anywhere I choose in the Empire... and all the fancy vests in London and...
And all the crackpot servants with one ear.
I was going to speak of someone with two tiny little ears... that aren't listening.
Tortuga.
Point and a half off the starboard bow, sir.
Larboard a little.
Aye, sir.
Can you make out the harbor yet?
Not yet, sir.
Steady. Steady her up.
Steady it is, sir.
Leech will anchor his ships well inshore.
Shorten sail until the other ships come abreast.
Aye, sir.
- In gun sails!
- In gun sails! In gun sails!
Tortuga dead ahead!
- Powder on deck?
- Aye, sir.
We'll sail in until we sight them, make a larboard tack... and rake them with broadsides as we cross the harbor.
- Them's happy words, Jamie.
- Deep six and rocky!
Deep six and rocky!
Stand by with your matches ready to fire.
Stand by with your matches ready to fire.
Stand by with your matches ready to fire!
And a half seven!
And a half seven!
A quarter less eight and rocky!
A quarter less eight and rocky.
Harbor clear! Not a ship in sight!
Not a ship in sight?
Where are they?
- Slid out on us. Thomas!
- Aye, sir.
Signal the captains to drop anchor and join me aboard.
- And Thomas!
- Aye, sir.
Get ashore and do some prowling through Tortuga.
Find out what frightened
Brother Leech off.
Aye, sir.
Milords and gentlemen of the assembly... three weeks ago, our governor told us... that actions speak louder than votes.
He vowed to clear the Caribbean of its sea butchers.
And what are his actions? How has he kept his vow? I'll tell you!
Another British ship has been ravaged... and sent to the bottom by the brotherhood of the black flag.
The Royal Treasury, with 100 passengers to England... and a cargo of gold and silver valued at $1,000,000... has been destroyed, murdered and gutted!
I call again for a vote of impeachment!
And gentlemen, Morgan has proved himself... unable to meet the menace of his old friends, the pirates.
As I have suggested from the beginning... perhaps he loves them too well to bring them harm.
- Who seconds Lord Denby's motion?
- I do.
I second the motion for an impeachment vote.
Your fulminations, milords and gentlemen... are full of bilge and blather.
You can vote yourselves purple in the face, look you... but you'll not impeach me.
Before you can take me off this seat,
I hold you need a letter from the king... and before you can get a letter from the king,
I'll have Leech's head for you.
I'll serve it up to you on a platter with an apple in its mouth.
My captains will bring Leech and his buccaneers back... to Port Royal.
And I promise you this.
I'll hang a pirate in each of your bedrooms... to dangle over your heads and give you the lie.
Ah! There's your answer, you popinjays!
Captain Waring, You come in the nick of time.
Come up here, Jamie-Boy.
Now, give us the full news of your victory.
My report is of a private nature,
Sir Henry.
- I landed only a half hour ago.
- This is no time for modesty!
Out with it! Your full report.
How many of the rats did you send to the bottom... and how many did you save up to hang here at Port Royal?
We don't see any rat, neither catch them, neither killer, Sir Henry.
And that's how you keep your vow, Morgan?
Three weeks and not a pirate touched... and our fleet sailing around, quacking at the... wind like a line of ducks in a mill pond.
My lords and gentlemen,
I charge treachery.
- Right you are, Lord Denby.
- Treachery's the word.
Leech was warned of our coming.
Someone from Port Royal sent a sloop racing to Tortuga.
The same ship that brought them news of the...
Prince Consort and the
Royal Treasurer.
This is the final insult.
The brave captain hides his bungling... behind accusation against us.
I demand proof of this foul accusation.
I'll bring you proof before I'm done.
I've come back for supplies.
I'm rejoining my ships, and then we're going to search the Caribbean until we find Leech.
Where are your ships hiding now,
Captain Waring?
That I'll not answer in this place.
My lords and gentlemen... if you'll appoint me messenger,
I'll take this matter to the king.
Hear, hear.
I'm embarking for England in two days with... my bride the Lady Margaret.
They commissioned me to present the case... of Pirate Morgan, Pirate Waring and
Pirate Leech to His Majesty.
And I'll bring back the royal signature upholding the impeachment.
I move we approve the impeachment of Morgan.
I second the move.
The move for impeachment has been made and been seconded.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you to call the members.
- Lord Jarnegan.
- I vote impeachment of...
Henry Morgan.
Mr. Geoffrey Clive.
Get back to your roosts, you popinjays.
- Sir William Courtenay.
- I pronounce this sitting adjourned!
I vote impeachment of Sir Henry
Morgan, governor of Jamaica.
- Mr. Stuart Marshall.
- I vote impeachment of Sir...
Henry Morgan.
I wish my nature hadn't changed.
I'd have made that whole assembly walk the plank.
You can't go wrong drowning politicians, Henry.
No, no. We're just daydreaming,
Jamie.
How soon will you have your ship loaded, Thomas?
Another 3 hours, sir.
- You can take the tide out tonight?
- Aye, sir.
Good. It's four days to Maracaibo.
Five.
And how do you make that out, Jamie?
Because I'm not sailing tonight.
I'm sailing tomorrow night.
- And why?
- I have a call to make.
- Where?
- It's a personal matter.
You're on that tack, are you?
That idiot child of Denby's.
- Well, my lad, you leave her alone.
- I'm having a talk with her.
And getting your face slapped again!
No, Jamie-Boy, the girl's a bride tomorrow.
- Good riddance for you.
- I'm staying in Port Royal tonight!
You'll get on your ship tonight and sail... her out, or you're no captain of mine!
If I see the Revenge in port when the tide's running.
I'll board her myself.
And you can stay behind and get your... face slapped pink and blue... by as many hussies as you like!
Now, go on, Jamie-Boy.
You've got your orders.
I'll be watching your topsails.
And don't forget, it's not
Margaret with... an apple in her mouth
I want, but Leech.
I never see you like this before, Jamie.
Hanging your head like a pelican over a wench.
And if you ask me, a flouncy wench... with no more feeling than a load of clams.
If you kick her in the heart, she'll break your leg.
Aw, Jamie-Boy... there's hundreds of wenches prettier than her... all ready to leap into your arms if you give them a whistle.
- Church bells.
- Aye.
Some people likes to hear them.
I like trumpets better.
- I can see her now.
- Who?
The Lady Margaret standing up in church... tomorrow beside that goose-faced Ingram.
Hey, you're going down the wrong road, Jamie.
Will you lend a hand, Tommy?
Jamie, by land or sea, you can always rely on...
Tom Blue for wrongdoing of any nature.
What do you want?
I didn't know you were a thief and a housebreaker too, Mr. Waring.
Oh. Still barking at me, eh?
I expected to find the bride cooing, and with a soft light in her eye.
But I suppose you're saving that up for the ceremony tomorrow.
You suppose correctly.
It would be much better for both of us, me gal if I hated you as I should.
I am not interested in your emotions, Mr. Waring.
Unfortunately, I have a tender feeling for you.
Oh, I'm as annoyed with the fact as you are.
I doubt that.
Why I'm spending time on you,
I don't know.
You're as arrogant and silly a wench as ever I've run afoul of.
I don't know which I'd rather see hanging from a yardarm, you or Leech.
If you'll go now, I promise to think... over your tender declaration.
I didn't know a woman could do this to a man... make him itch to strangle her one minute... and marry her the next.
- Oh, so you want to marry me?
- We'll discuss that later.
I dislike having to call the servants to throw you out.
Look at you... hating me... and your eyes saying, "Don't go away.
"I belong to you. Make me belong to you.
"Keep me from marrying this oily little jackanapes, Ingram."
- You're mad.
- No, I've read your eyes right.
I've known too many hellcats not to know... what's behind all that blaze and bluster.
Confound it, you idiot, I'm telling you that I love you.
And you'll call me "Jamie-Boy" before... you call that stick of a man "husband."
Well, are you coming with me or not?
Your conceit, Mr. Waring, has unhinged your mind.
I warn you. Don't make me angry.
I always knew you were a nasty, vulgar rogue.
Don't touch me!
Be quiet! Lie still, I tell you!
Be quiet, or I'll crack that iron skull of yours.
You make courtship a little more strenuous than I like it.
Holy Moses! Jamie!
Grab her feet and help me get her inside.
Stand by to cast off.
You're flirting with trouble, Jamie.
Cast off, I tell you!
- Lie still.
- Giddap.
Lie still, you...
- Where's that horse blanket, Thomas?
- I'm-a sittin' on it.
I can't understand why you give her a second look.
- She's nothing to me, you fool.
- But she's mean, Jamie, and she's ungrateful.
Morgan will bellow his brains out when he hears of this.
It's for Morgan I'm doing it.
This'll keep Ingram anchored in
Jamaica and away from the king.
It'd be a lot prettier if you could put Ingram... in a sack and drown him.
I can see no good in drowning her.
I'm not drowning her, Thomas.
Not yet.
Stop your clacking and drive on.
- Potatoes?
- No, thank you.
- Meat?
- No.
- How about a little bread and cheese?
- I'm not eating with you.
- Oh, you'd rather starve, huh?
- Yes.
A little fasting wouldn't hurt you any.
Also, it might improve your manners.
My manners?
Look at it calmly. I kept you from marrying a fellow you hated.
That's a lie.
Don't argue with me while I'm eating.
I put you on a fine ship, give you the best cabin and stick... a bolt on your door.
Thanks for the bolt.
If you were really grateful, you'd tell me something.
Someone in Port Royal has been coming into a lot of money lately.
- What do you mean?
- Someone who hates Morgan... and has been playing partners with Leech... giving him information and collecting a captain's... share of the booty, or
I miss my guess.
I can tell by your change of color... that you know someone who's had a windfall lately.
- Who is it? That fine father of yours?
- No, my f...
Ingram then. Well, why don't you answer?
You're not after Leech. You would like to make me believe... something foul against a decent man!
You didn't answer me. Come in.
What is it, Thomas?
We just found a split in the main brace, Captain.
Will you have a look at it?
- A split in what main brace?
- We also located...
- a barnacle on the cathead.
- What?
- Oh, uh, I'll be right up.
- Aye, sir.
And, uh, if you want to eat behind... my back, I promise not to notice it.
There's two of them, Jamie.
It's Leech.
I knew it the minute I sighted
the topmast.
- The Black Swan.
- And the Hawk, I make it.
They've sighted us, all right.
We're no match for the pair of them.
We may as well run for it.
We can't outrun the Black Swan.
We'd be pounded to splinters in a fight.
We can't fight with 100 guns against us.
We can't fight, and we can't run.
Nothing left to do but to disappear, which ain't practical.
Run up the black flag and head her around.
We're gonna join Leech.
But you can't fool Leech with a baby trick like that, Jamie.
Hoist the Jolly Roger.
It's a beggar's chance, but our only one.
By this time, our ships are at
Maracaibo waiting for us.
We'll join Leech and lead him to Maracaibo.
He's not an easy man to lead, Jamie.
Main braces.
Back your main yards.
Come on. Get back to your cabin and stay there.
Why? So I won't see that flag and know what you are?
I'm captain of this ship, and you're taking my orders.
That's Leech and his cutthroats.
We can't fight and we can't run.
There's only one way to get out of this alive, and that's to tell Leech
I've left Morgan.
That's exactly what I thought.
Mr. Ingram is right.
You are working with Leech.
You've got a head made of iron.
Get in there and think what you want.
Come aboard, Captain. Come aboard.
And welcome.
We had a hard time finding you,
Captain.
Don't try any fancy tricks on me,
Waring.
You're under my cannon, and
I can blast you out of the... water with a wink.
You chucklehead. Do you see anything on this ship... that looks like we was planning to go into battle?
If you're smart, you'll stop jabbering and talk sense.
All right. Let's hear you make sense.
Why did you turn back?
To join you, if you're still interested in Maracaibo.
Oh. And I suppose the other ships are hunting me to join me too, eh?
I never seen a man so suspicious.
- What's your answer?
- My answer is they're after... your neck, Leech.
But I'm not with them.
I'm after gold.
Did you desert Morgan?
The way I look at it, Morgan deserted me... taking up with that pack of jackanapes.
I'm not of a mind to end up playing government... with a quill stuck behind my ear.
I stood it as long as I could.
But Morgan or no Morgan, I'm here.
You're lying, Waring, you were with him yesterday.
You told the assembly you were sailing off to capture us.
You get your tidings quickly, don't you?
Yes. And they've always been right.
You've a skull for thinking, Captain.
What else could I tell the assembly?
I've no hankering to grow on a gallows tree.
Enough of jawing. Do we sign articles or not?
There's a hole in it, Waring.
If you deserted Morgan and left... the other ships to join me... why did you go back to
Port Royal at all?
Well, come on. Out with it. Why?
To get my wife.
Oh, here you are, my dove.
These good gentlemen seem to doubt that...
I have a pretty wife aboard.
Will you come out, my sweet, and give them a look at you?
My love, may I present Captain Leech.
Madame Waring, daughter of the former...
Governor of Jamaica, Lord Denby.
Now you know why I'm not too welcome back in Port Royal.
- Captain Waring...
- Yes, my dear. What is it?
I'm pleased to meet you, ma'am.
My apologies, Captain.
I'd go back to Port Royal myself to pick up a lady of such caliber.
Then we'll forget the misunderstanding.
Do you want to join forces for profit, or shall we be on our way?
Aye, we'll sign articles.
And just to guarantee that your ship will come along to help us... you and the lady sail with me on the Swan, eh?
It'll make the trip jollier.
That's a fair bid.
But I don't fancy subjecting my wife, who is a delicate creature, as you can see... to that riffraff crew you have aboard.
Madame, you'll be treated like the queen ya are.
I promise you I'll slit the throat of the... first dog that brings a blush to you.
You can't ask for more than that, Captain.
Are you agreed or not?
Agreed.
- Mr. Blue!
- Aye, sir.
Take over. And to assure
Captain Leech... that you're an honest man... sail abreast of the Swan at all times.
Aye, Captain.
"All other officers to get one share.
"Article eight. Each captain has a right...
"to value all spoils before they are divvied up."
That's what we all agreed to at Tortuga.
Stick your name on it if you're favorable.
I'm considering...
There's no denying that you know the...
Gold Coast better than anybody on the Main.
It'd be a shame for you to waste your talents up at Port Royal.
- My share's always been 10.
- There's no arguing.
Five you'll get.
You'll nip enough out of the first 2 prizes to set you up for a year.
What's the sense of waiting around for some lumbering merchantman?
Why not hit straight for Maracaibo?
It's still the richest spot on the Spanish Main.
Maracaibo is the plum we're after picking, my lad.
Oh. I'll sign.
Stick you name right there.
Have a drink.
I'll do my drinking in Maracaibo.
Good night, gentlemen.
He's got some articles in his cabin what need signing.
Get out!
Get out!
You can't come in here!
With so beautiful a wife, they'd think it strange if I didn't.
I want to congratulate you for showing a spark of reason.
You saved both our hides, for the time being anyway.
All you got to do is keep on looking... at me with adoring eyes... and maybe we'll get out of this in one piece.
- You monster!
- Shh!
No love spats, my gal. Our friends may be listening.
Did you find out who the traitor is who warned these men?
Oh, you're not so certain anymore it's me, hmm?
I'm certain of nothing except that I'll be murdered... before I get out of this, thanks to you.
We're not dead yet, my gal.
- You can't sleep here.
- I'm afraid I'll have to.
Are you very lonesome for Jamaica?
Don't shout when you answer me.
Yes.
And you still regard me as a beast unfit for human society?
Yes.
And you're still in love with Mr. Ingram?
I said, are you still in love with that darling man?
Don't you dare come near me.
Don't worry, my gal. I won't.
Not until you call me Jamie-Boy... and ask me three times.
Be careful how you wake me up.
I'm ready to repel all boarders.
Sweet dreams.
Shh! Keep still. You'll get your throat cut.
Lie down.
What do you want?
I have come to offer me apologies.
Me oldest friend gets married, and I forget... to give him a wedding present.
It's off the Royal Treasurer.
She was on her honeymoon.
Thanks for the gift, Leech.
As pretty a sight as I ever seen.
Lawful wedlock.
There's nothing like it.
Now, that's a strange place to stick a sword right over... the bride's head.
Are you trying to make her uneasy?
Your presence is more disturbing... to Madame Waring, I assure you.
Now, Jamie, you're talking different than you used to.
I recall your trading me a gal in Portobelo... for two barrels of rum.
Of course, this one's better and worth more.
She's all in one piece. She's got two ears, no fingers missing.
Worth three barrels of rum.
Why don't you offer him five?
Don't tempt him, darling.
I might take it.
That's teaching her, Jamie.
You seem to enjoy subjecting me to... every kind of embarrassment possible.
No, my sweet. Now, don't be a snob.
We're pulling close to
Maracaibo, Leech.
You're gonna be little good to us if you keep laying your head in a... bottle every night.
I'm beginning to think you're right, Jamie-Boy.
I'm gonna need my head more than I figured.
- Get out of this bed.
- Do you think it's safe?
You didn't have to get in here.
You're very ungrateful, madame.
I'm sleeping with a pistol after this... and if you come near me,
I'll shoot you.
Here you are.
I give you permission to blast my head off... if I'm ever idiot enough to come within a foot of you.
Hey, Captain, where'd you go hiding?
- We opened another keg.
- Aw, get away!
I'm thinking.
Thinking? Thinking what, Captain?
I don't know.
I won't know until the wind's blown my head clear.
- Where is he?
- Oh, Sir Henry!
Jamie Waring! Where is that toad of a man?
- How did you come here?
- Don't mince around!
Fetch the deserter out of his hiding.
Captain Jamie dropped off to
Port Royal for supplies.
- We've had no word of him.
- Well, I will give you word of him.
He left Port Royal with Denby's puling child in a sack.
Stole her out from her home, look you, like a red Indian.
What, Captain Henry?
I am sitting in me new wig as lord of Jamaica... when 100 foaming parents come clattering... and howling for me life's blood.
- They scuttled you?
- No, I cracked a dozen skulls... and fought me way to the waterfront with the whole... of Jamaica heaving stones at me... and hid myself in a stinking load of trout.
Hoisted sail that night, and for three days...
I've been chewing raw fish.
Well, don't gape at me. Fetch me some ale before I blow away to dust!
Get out of the way there, make room for Sir Henry.
Uh, sit down, Sir Henry.
Do you think Captain Jamie has deserted, or do you... count on him coming to Maracaibo?
I am only praying that Lady Margaret does not stab him in his sleep.
For I have my own plans for him.
Aye, I've dreamed them... all the way from Port Royal.
The minute that drooling traitor sets his nose into Maracaibo...
I am taking his innards out and stringing... them to the tops of his masts.
What about Leech, Sir Henry?
Do not call me Sir Henry.
Jamaica is lost, and
'my title with it.
Our only chance of getting them back and keeping off... the king's gibbet... is to bring in the heads of Jamie
Waring and Billy Leech... with Lady Margaret in good enough repair to bespeak us... as her saviors.
Post your lookouts around the waterfront.
And wake me up at the first sign of that wench-fancier.
- Are you awake?
- Yes.
- Can you swim?
- No.
That's too bad.
- Have you ever seen a sea battle?
- No.
Well, you're gonna see one pretty soon.
A battle?
Then I'd better get dressed.
Don't look.
Me gal, I have other things on my mind for the moment.
- Who will be in the battle?
- We will.
My ships, the Reckless and the Lady Bess... are waiting for me in Maracaibo now.
Why didn't you tell me?
You've been a little critical of me ever since we started.
English ships.
Yes. Leech and his crew are sailing into Maracaibo... expecting to find a few cannon and an old stone wall.
- Instead, they're finding 100 cannon...
- Stay as you are.
Don't move or I'll blast you!
Tie them up.
Have you gone mad, you scurvy idiots?
Quiet!
- We're an hour from battle.
- I'll crack your head for you.
Put 'em down...
You lied to me about having a bride.
What else did you lie to me about?
Are your friends... waiting for me in Maracaibo?
Friends? What friends?
I've signed with you.
Aye, signed and bound, foxy Jamie.
I'm sailing the Revenge into
Maracaibo myself... under English colors, with my own crew aboard... and I'm blowing whoever's waiting out of the water... while they're still whistling and waving handkerchiefs at you.
And what's more, I'm taking the gal with me.
- I'll not go with you.
- You'll fare better with me... than with Jamie.
I promise you. I'll marry you fair and... stick no sword over your head.
He's safer out of the way now.
No, not yet. We may be doing him an injustice... and if we are, I shall want to beg his pardon.
But if we aren't, I'll wanna do more things... to him than stick him clean with a sword.
Come along, my gal.
No! Let me go! Let me go!
Now, be quiet.
You'll have to wait till after the battle for your wooing.
I promise you. If you start screaming... you'll get the flat of a sword across ya.
It's the Revenge, sir.
What are your orders?
Let her come in and moor.
But if there's a gentleman called
Jamie Waring aboard...
- bring him to me, alive if possible.
- Aye, sir.
Look at him, bringing her in like a fumbling lubber.
Forgot all he ever knew about sailing a ship.
I can't make it out.
He's sailing queer.
He is love-crazy.
That's very obliging of them... coming down... to the shore to bid us welcome.
Steady. Steady her up.
Well, you may lock me up in a hole, you varmints, but you can't sit on me.
Here's to you. Bottoms up.
You bloody jackanapes!
- They ought to be taking in sail.
- Blue must be drunk.
Roast me alive! He's coming in like he was going to blast us!
Ready! Fire!
Jamie Waring, that black-livered turncoat!
He's handed his soul back to the devil!
Get to the ships and blow the traitor to dust!
Get to the fort guns!
A broadside!
Fire!
- Hard over!
- She don't answer.
The tiller's gone.
She's gone.
Lose your sheets!
Lose your sheets!
Turn loose your braces!
Lively there!
Graham!
- Aye, sir.
- Keep pouring your fire... into the Revenge.
And get me 20 men, I'm going to board her, and with... me own hands... pull the gullet out of the mouth of that traitor,
- Jamie Waring.
- Aye, sir.
Tommy Blue!
- Tommy!
- Jamie.
All hands stand by... and when I tell you, heave the hatch cover, come out fighting.
Get ready, boys.
Here, what are you d...
Captain Leech, look!
Heave!
You blasted king's spy!
- Where is she?
- Down in my cabin.
Jamie, we finished that bunch of sea li...
I warned you myself about crossing swords with Leech.
Here. Let me see, Jamie.
Missed your gizzard by an inch.
Rather a neat hole and squirting blood like a bilge pump.
Is he done for?
Leaking a little, but on even keel, Captain.
Good. I was afraid he would be thwarting me... by giving up the ghost prematurely.
Lady Margaret, my humble apologies to you... for the foul antics of this gentleman who was once my friend.
I assure you that every indignity you have suffered... at his hands will be avenged.
I'm taking him back to Port Royal and hanging him on the... dock in chains... and there he'll dangle to brood on his crimes till he's stoned to death.
- Permit me to unfasten you.
- I don't understand you, Henry... or what you've got against poor Jamie.
I've been with him constant, glued to his side... and I've never seen him commit anything in the way of a crime... except maybe a little weak-mindedness.
He stole this innocent child from her parents' home, look you... and forced his will on her like a mad savage.
That, sir, is striking at the roots of civilization.
And he'll speak his apologies from the gibbet... to this unfortunate girl and all her kin.
- He did not steal me, Sir Henry.
- What did you say?
I came with him of my own will.
- You'll swear to that?
- Yes, on a bible.
He said he would like my company on a sea trip... and I told him I would be delighted to go with him.
I feel exceedingly grateful to
Captain Waring for... his hospitality.
The girl is mad.
Captain, we've just finished the count.
The pirates have suffered 200 killed,
70 wounded... and we've taken 130 prisoners.
- What are your orders?
- Hoist sail.
I'm going to take this mad woman back to Jamaica.
Aye, sir.
Well, we've had a nice taste of fun,
Tom Blue.
Aye. That we have, Henry.
Nothing like it to keep your ears pink.
Look you, it wouldn't take much arguing... to talk me out of Jamaica.
Who wants to be sitting around stuffed with lace... and a wig shutting the wind from your head?
Look at that sea.
And the world stretched around you like... a barrel of gold ready to drop in your lap.
It's the only life, Henry.
Say the word and the
Caribbean is yours.
Captain Waring! Captain Waring!
Clear the deck for action, Henry.
Here comes the last broadside.
Jamie-Boy, you shouldn't be out of bed.
Haven't you caused me enough trouble already?
Get back to your bunk.
Oh, Jamie-Boy.
That's only twice. Once more.
I said, three times.
Jamie-Boy.
You're not going to leave me in Jamaica?
Oh, that I don't know.
I always sample a bottle of wine before I buy it.
Come on. Let's have a sip to see if you're worth taking along.
What, no bites?
There he goes. It's the end of the Spanish Main.
