The doctor says the coffee is no good.
I made it the same as I always do.
It should be alright, then.
Things are a bit strained in there this evening.
What's it about this time?
─ Only the holiday.
He wants to go to Cornwall and she doesn't.
But darling, you're very fond of fish.
I may be. But I'm not fond of catching them.
Well there is no need for you to fish. You can just sit in the boat.
Exactly.
I can just sit in the boat.
I've been doing that for the past 5 years.
I'm sick and tired of sitting in a boat.
If you feel like that about it,
I'll go on my own.
Very well.
What?
I think perhaps a holiday apart might be a very good thing for both of us.
In other words you're off in search of a little adventure, all on your own.
If I were in search of that sort of adventure, I shouldn't go to Cornwall.
Well, you never know what you might find down there if you try.
Darling, because I want to go fishing and you don't?
I'm perfectly content to stay at home.
Very well.
Then I will have a bachelor holiday.
I think I might rather enjoy a bit of fishing.
Alone.
I suppose you think you're seeing things.
Yes, nurse.
Nurse?
You are a nurse, aren't you?
Do I look like a nurse?
No.
I must have hit my head as I went down.
I wish you wouldn't stare.
You're certainly not a nurse.
Who are you?
Miranda.
Miranda.
Where am I?
─ You're in my cave.
I brought you here.
You fell out of your boat.
Fell? I was pulled.
─ You're a rotten swimmer.
I may be a bit light headed, but to me you seem to have a ..
Tail?
─ Yes.
I have .. I'm a mermaid.
That doctor Martin is late.
─ Hmm.
He's had The Adventure out all day, ain't he George?
Hmm.
Are you going out to look for him?
─ No.
He knows what he's doing of.
I love tall men.
The last two I caught were so short
I had to throw them back again.
How do I get out of here?
That's the only way.
Oh that?
I could never do it.
You could if I helped you.
But I'm not going to.
Why not?
─ Because I'm lonely.
But you wouldn't dream of keeping me here.
Why, I'm a respectable married man.
Oh. So you've got a wife?
─ Yes.
Well there are plenty of men on land. She'll soon find another one.
How do you mean?
I'm thinking of keeping you here for myself.
You couldn't do that.
─ Oh, couldn't I?
There is a dreadful shortage of men below sea.
But I couldn't live here.
That's what they all think at first.
Do you mean to tell me that other men have lived here?
Several.
But not with me.
You are my first adventure.
Where did you get all these?
I picked them up mostly from ships.
So, you can read?
Of course.
I suppose you don't know what happened to Amber in chapter 18?
The same as happened in chapter 17, only twice.
Oh, I'm beginning to feel hungry.
You haven't got any food here, I suppose?
There you are.
That?
Oh, thank you.
Well.
Don't you eat fish?
Yes, but not raw.
And certainly not alive.
How funny you are.
Hey! Hey, where are you going?
Oh ..
I'm so happy.
Are you, Miranda?
I love the way you say Miranda.
Say it again.
Miranda.
Miranda.
Miranda.
You have the most beautiful knees.
What does it feel like to have two legs?
Oh, I find them quite useful.
What would my sisters say if they could see me now.
Yes. And what would my wife say if she could see me.
Is she as pretty as I am, Paul?
Hmm. She's quite attractive.
Then why did you leave her?
I haven't.
I'm having a week's holiday. That's all.
Oh .. are you?
But I'm going to keep you here.
Unless.
Unless what?
You take me on land with you.
On land?
You?
─ Yes, why not?
I've always wanted to go and this is my chance.
You're a doctor. You can take me as your invalid patient.
But ..?
Oh, my tail. You can wrap it up.
But you will have to buy me some clothes.
Some wonderful ones.
Where does your wife get hers?
Manell.
Oh yes.
I've seen some of his in Vogue.
They'll have to be specially long.
But what's wrong with that?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all.
I want to see all the sights.
I want to go to Buckingham
Palace and Billingsgate Market.
But most of all, I want to go to the opera.
It's out of the question.
What would people say?
I mean ..
How would I get you out of here?
Miranda, what would you eat?
Where would you sleep?
Miranda, please! Miranda!
Miranda.
Oh.
Alright.
[ Telephone ]
Yes?
You wish to speak to
Monsieur Manell personally?
Shall I tell him?
Oh yes, Dr Martin.
Long distance for you, Monsieur.
Dr Paul Martin from Cornwall.
Oh, how tiresome.
Manell here.
Dr Martin?
How charming of you.
Yes. Well, I'm ringing from the Anchor Hotel, Pendar.
Pendar.
Yes, I want three evening dresses.
Two day dresses.
And a what-you-call-it, a travelling coat.
I want you to make them a foot longer than usual.
And send them to me here.
Cornwall?
But Doctor Martin, without a fitting it is most irregular.
Dresses, they're very long for madame.
They will drag on the floor.
Very well, Dr Martin as a very special favour to you.
They will have to be from stock of course.
Oh yes, with any little alterations that madame should require.
Yes. Yes, they shall be sent out today or tomorrow at the latest.
The colours you leave to me?
Well.
I have one very chic dress of sea-green taffeta.
Clare, where are you?
Isobel, what's all this about?
─ A surprise. Look.
Isn't it wonderful?
─ Oh darling, it's lovely.
I'm so glad both for you and Nigel.
You're sweet. I simply had to tell you on my way out.
Oh, any news of Paul?
─ Yes, there is.
Considerable news.
─ What do you mean?
My dear, he's bringing a patient back with him from Cornwall.
To live here for three weeks.
What here, in this flat?
But Clare, who is it?
Oh, I don't know. Some old dear he met in Pendar.
She can't walk.
Oh darling, she'll never stop ringing for bottles.
I know. They are coming tonight.
Well, I suppose husbands on holiday could get into worst mischief.
Well, that's one thing I never have to worry about.
There.
Now we should be quite safe.
What would they do if they find out about me?
Oh I don't know. Probably put you in a peep-show I suppose.
Oh, how disgusting.
─ Hmm.
I remember I did see a mermaid once, in a glass case in ..
In Port Said. A pickled one.
Oh that must have been pour aunt Augusta.
Yes, she wasn't in the least like you.
She was very old.
─ And very pickled.
This all looks very nice, Betty.
─ Thank you.
Will the old lady be dining with you or here in her room tonight, madam?
Oh, in here I expect.
She is sure to be feeling tired after her journey.
I'm sorry about all this extra work.
─ Oh, I shall manage.
When is Charles going to meet the train?
─ I think he's just leaving.
[ Doorbell ]
Martin?
─ Yep.
Couple of cases. Sign here. Number 11.
Where are they?
Here, son.
Here. Martin. Two cases.
Number 11. Sign here.
Whatever is all this?
A barrel of oysters .. from Cornwall.
What's in this one?
Fish.
"Miss Trewella. Care of Martin."
Trewella? That must be the old lady's name.
Yes, I don't mind saying I'm against the whole thing. Turn the place upside down.
Billingsgate.
[ Door knocks ]
Yes?
May I have a word with you, madam?
─ Yes, Charles.
This old lady that's coming to stay, madam.
I hope I shan't be expected to wheel her about in a bath-chair.
Oh.
No, madam.
Very well, Charles. I will speak to the doctor about it.
Very good, madam.
Is this really London?
─ Yes.
But it looks so dirty.
It is a bit, isn't it. Look, Miranda.
I think I'd better go on first and have a talk with Clare.
What will I do?
─ My car will be here.
Charles will drive you round for a bit while I go on by taxi.
Charles?
─ Yes. He's my chauffeur.
Oh.
Evening, Betty.
─ Evening, sir.
Have a nice holiday?
─ What?
Oh yes. Yes I did, thank you.
Darling.
─ Paul.        ─ My sweet.
Oh you look wonderfully well.
Have you had a good time?
Magnificent.
─ Did you catch any big ones?
Rather. One whopper.
─ How big?
Big.
Well. Now that's over, suppose you start explaining?
Did you get my letter?
─ I did?
Where is Miss ..?
─ Trewella, dear.
I came by taxi and left her with Charles.
He's bringing her by a roundabout route.
She wanted to see Buckingham Palace.
─ Good heavens.
You don't really mind me bringing her here, do you Clare?
I suppose not.
She is by no means a straightforward case.
What actually is the matter with her?
Well I told you, dear.
She couldn't walk.
Her main trouble is a mental one.
Don't tell me she's a little dotty?
─ Far from it.
But you'll have to help me, Clare.
How?
Well, to begin with, the poor child ..
Child?
How old is she, Paul?
Quite young. Could be any age really.
Yes.
I had been picturing someone .. rather old.
Oh had you, dear? Why?
Oh, I don't know.
A bath-chair. Association of ideas, I suppose.
You were saying: the poor child?
Oh yes. Yes. She's met very few people.
In fact, she's had hardly any social life at all.
I see.
That explains Buckingham Palace.
She believes in starting at the top.
Buckingham Palace, Miss.
Oh stop, Charles. Please stop.
Look at that beautiful man.
Over there by the box.
Does he live here?
Him?
No, Miss .. he just works here.
You've got a nicer uniform, though.
Charles.
Are you married?
No, Miss. Just walking out.
Walking out of what?
Isn't she very pretty?
Well, you'll see for yourself, Miss.
She's Betty. She ..
She works at that flat.
Do you live at the flat, too?
Yes, Miss.
I shall like that.
I had to get her away from Cornwall.
She needs to be taken out of herself.
That, combined with a very special diet ..
Should put her on her feet again.
I'm afraid we can't quite hope for that.
Darling, her diet isn't going to be too difficult for Betty to cope with is it?
No, no. Quite simple.
Light, you know.
No meat, but .. fish.
Plenty of fish.
Paul, why couldn't she have gone to a nursing home?
Oh, that wouldn't suit
Miranda's case at all.
Miranda?
Yes.
A pretty name, isn't it.
Do you call her Miranda?
─ Yes.
She doesn't call you Paul by any chance?
As a matter of fact she does.
Really?
Well darling, it's business, You know.
There is one thing I absolutely insist on. You've got to get a nurse for her.
A nurse?
Yes.
I'll ring nurse Carey.
That's a very good idea.
For Carey?
I thought that was the one you were never going to use again.
No?
Nurse Carey is a bit eccentric, that's all. Might be a good thing in this case.
I give up.
Nurse Carey?
Doctor Martin.
Very well. And you?
Good.
Nurse .. are you on a case just now?
No, I'm not on a case just now, doctor.
I see.
I beg your pardon?
The birds are twittering so loudly.
Birds.
Yes. I can call round and see you tonight.
Yes, nurse.
You will .. you will live here, of course?
Oh, it will be for four weeks.
Four weeks?
I thought you said three?
─ Darling, please.
Darling.
No, nurse, that was Mrs ..
I beg your pardon?
Tonight. Yes.
Oh no, I can be round in two toots.
I was just having a quiet ..
I said, I was just having a quiet evening at home.
Am I heavy?
─ No, Miss.
Quite the opposite.
You are so strong, Charles.
I keep fit, Miss.
You have got such muscles.
I do a bit of rowing.
I suppose that's it.
Doesn't that give you a funny feeling?
Yes, Miss.
Good evening.
Good evening, Miss.
Tell the doctor I have taken Miss
Miranda to the bedroom, will you.
Are we going to your bedroom now, Charles?
Well ..?
Have you got to put me down?
No, Miss.
I've told you not to call me
"Miss" when we're alone.
Force of habit.
You've got such nice ears.
Have I?
─ Yes.
Nice and big.
My father always told me
I looked like a spaniel.
That's because you look so sad.
Well, it is sad.
That you can't walk.
I don't feel in the least sad.
I believe you like being carried.
─ I do.
I do.
Very much.
Charles.
You can put Miss Trewella down now.
Well.
A nice way to behave.
An "old lady" indeed. Not that you weren't enjoying yourself.
You know, it's a funny thing, but she's got such a cold ..
When you carry her.
Clare.
This is Miss Trewella.
Miranda.
How do you do.
─ How do you do.
You are very beautiful, aren't you.
Paul said you were just nice-looking.
Did he now?
─ Well ..
You must be feeling tired after your journey.
Oh no. I'm far too excited to be tired.
You're going to bed as soon as Nurse Carey gets here.
No I'm not. I feel wonderful.
You're going to be bed. I'm your doctor.
─ No.
Thank you. Dr Martin?
Is he expecting you, madam?
─ Yes. I'm nurse Carey.
Would you mind waiting in the study, please?
Certainly.
Well I think it is most unfair. I've always wanted to come to London.
Does that taste of anything?
Would you like to try?
No. I don't like fire so near my face.
Will it worry you if I do?
─ Not at all.
Do you always have to cook it or can you eat it raw?
Excuse me, sir. There is a nurse Carey to see you. She's in the study, sir.
Oh yes. I'd better see her right away.
Excuse me, will you.
I love Charles, don't you?
Now you've embarrassed him.
Did a box of fish arrive?
─ Yes, sir. Addressed to Miss Trewella.
Ah, then take into Miss Trewella's bathroom , will you.
The box of fish, sir?
─ Open it first, of course.
Of course, sir.
Of course?
Have you any family in Cornwall, Miranda?
Oh yes, there are dozens of us.
─ Dozens?
Yes. Some of them are rather nice.
But I've got one sister that I can't bear.
Fortunately she lives in the South Pacific.
So I don't have to see her very often.
No, I suppose not.
We used to sing good duets, though.
I have rather a nice voice, you know.
You know a lot about music?
─ No, practically nothing.
But I'd give anything to go to the opera.
Well, if Paul says you can we might make up a party and go. Tomorrow, perhaps.
How wonderful.
Then I can see all the people and they can see me and no-one will suspect.
Suspect what?
That I can't walk.
You see, nurse Carey.
This is a rather peculiar case.
But I thought it may be.
Seeing that it's so long since I had the pleasure of a case from you.
I am supposed to be "eccentric".
Is that the word?
How peculiar is this case, doctor?
Well, to start with, it must be treated with the utmost secrecy.
A woman?
Yes, nurse. A young woman.
─ Oh.
And how ill is this patient?
Well, in a manner of speaking, she isn't actually ill at all.
Oh, isn't she?
I see.
Goodnight.
No, no, nurse. It isn't that at all.
Please nurse, please.
You must believe me.
I am trusting you absolutely, nurse.
Very well.
I don't want to know anything you don't want to tell me, I'm sure.
You want a bath-chair, the patient is very peculiar.
No talking.
And I'm to be here at 10 o'clock.
Good day, Dr Martin.
Oh, let me see you to the door, nurse.
[ Telephone ]
Hello? Oh, Isobel.
No.
No, I don't think you'd better tonight.
What?
She's very different from what I expected.
I'll tell you tomorrow.
Yes, darling.
Is Nigel with you?
Give him my love.
Oh, he's wonderfully well.
Fishing always agrees with him.
Yes, he's caught quite a lot.
In fact the whole flat is full of fish.
Darling, I've got to go now. Goodbye.
Are you alright?
Well, I'm alright now.
But I think smoking is horrible.
How extraordinarily cold you are.
Am I?
Yes.
Terribly cold.
Who is Isobel?
She lives in the flat above.
She runs a hat shop.
Oh, I've never worn a hat.
And Nigel?
─ Her fiancée.
He's a painter.
─ Is he handsome?
Isobel thinks so.
─ Do you?
I just think Paul is.
So do I.
One moment.
Excuse me, darling. Do you mind?
Now Miranda, you can say goodnight. Bed.
Won't Clare mind?
Have I said the wrong thing?
"You are so strong, Charles."
"You have such muscles."
"I love your ears."
"Nice and big."
Do you think Clare likes me?
I'll find out.
What about the nurse, Paul?
─ I've picked one who won't say a thing.
No, no. You can't undress here.
Why not?
─ Well, never mind.
It's very odd.
Aren't you going to stay?
─ No, Miranda.
Say "Miranda" again.
─ Miranda.
Miranda. Miranda.
Lovely.
Goodnight.
[ Miranda singing ]
[ Miranda singing. Loud. ]
[ Miranda singing ]
Better hurry, darling. That nurse of yours will be here any minute.
I know.
Thank you, darling.
Did Miranda sleep well?
Well, apparently. She's very lively this morning, anyway.
And do we all go to the opera tonight?
─ Opera?
Yes, she's simply dying to.
I don't think it's a very good idea.
─ Oh, I do.                ─ You do?
Yes. After all, you've always said she needs taking out of herself.
We can borrow Mark's box at Covent Garden. He's away.
Yes. Yes, we could do that.
Have a look and see what we're doing tonight.
I can go up to Isobel's and ask her to come too, and she can bring Nigel.
Tonight .. "Rheingold".
Oh dear, I hate all those dreary mermaids.
Do you? Oh, do you, dear?
That must be nurse Carey.
Yes. Yes, I'd better see Miranda.
Tell Charles to bring the nurse to Miranda's room will you.
Oh .. Miranda.
Well, where are they, then?
─ I don't know.
Shan't be long, nurse.
Miranda, you mustn't do that.
What room is that?
That's the bathroom.
Oh, and it's .. it's full of fish.
Fish?
Miss Miranda.
Now let it go, girl.
Oh. Oh, good morning, nurse.
I was just preparing the patient.
That's what it sounded like.
Yes, well perhaps you'd like to see for yourself.
Yes.
Oh, nurse. I must tell you.
Miss Trewella sleeps .. in her bath.
Oh?
─ Yes.
Yes. In a bath full of cold water.
Well, everyone to their taste, I suppose.
Miranda.
This is nurse Carey.
Hello, nurse .. have an oyster.
Oh the pretty thing.
It's a mermaid.
I've always believed in them.
Oh doctor, this is delightful.
Now dear, hurry up and finish your breakfast.
Hello, darling.
─ Clare.
Well come on, tell me all about it.
There's plenty to tell you,
I can assure you.
The "old lady" has turned out to be very young and very pretty.
Darling, there is more to Paul than I thought.
Yes. Her name is Miranda Trewella.
And if you ask me, she's got Paul by the ears.
Darling, I can't wait to see her.
Well, you can see her tonight.
We're taking her to the opera.
Paul and I thought perhaps you and Nigel would like to come too?
I think we'd love to. What's on?
─ Rheingold.
Well, I'm not mad about opera myself, but Nigel is.
I'm going to watch Miranda working on your Paul.
Well, you won't be the only one watching, believe me.
What?
Raw fish sandwiches. Doctor's orders.
For you know who.
Yes.
The one you're so taken up with.
Miss Trewella.
That looks very nice, Betty.
These are the special ones for
Miss Trewella.     ─ Thank you.
Madam .. about that matter of the bath-chair?
Oh yes, Charles. I've spoken to the doctor about it.
It's alright, you needn't wheel it out.
Well, I've changed my mind, madam.
Have you?
I shall be very pleased to wheel the young lady out, madam.
And now that I've seen her.
Well .. I feel ..
You feel what, Charles?
Sorry for her, madam.
I'll tell her, Charles.
I wish you would, madam.
My great grandmother visited land when she was a girl.
She sang at St Anna church.
─ Mind that thermometer.
She was rather naughty, though.
There was a choirboy called Matthew Trewella.
I see.
What does it say?
─ Nicely below normal.
Are you married, nurse Carey?
My husband died ten years ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
─ I was very glad.
Oh?
Men are fickle creatures.
─ Oh, I love them.
Excuse me, Miss Miranda.
Don't you find your tail rather a ..
Handicap with the gentlemen?
Oh no.
It provides what you might call an "element of surprise".
I shouldn't wonder.
There are the others.
Miss Lambert and Mr Hood please, madam.
Clare.
─ Hello, darling.
Nigel, this is the first chance
I've had to congratulate you.
Thank you.
─ Hello, Nigel.
Come and get a drink.
─ Fine.
Where is she?
Darling, she won't be a moment.
She's got to be dressed.
Nigel ought to be dressed, too.
Oh, it suits him to be untidy.
But it doesn't suit me.
Just look at that tie.
Alright?
Yes, very nice.
─ Cheers.
Good luck.
Tell me, Paul.
What's this about your new patient?
It sounds very interesting.
─ What does?
This .. psychological cure you're doing.
Isobel told me about it.
Of course, she was rather flippant.
She very often is, you know.
Oh. What did she say?
She said the treatment was all fish and faith.
Excuse me.
Oh dear, you must have got hold of one of Miranda's specials.
Ha ha. That's the fish part of the cure, Nigel.
Charles, I'll take her.
I can manage, sir.
─ I'll take her, Charles.
Well, I could manage, sir.
Miranda .. this is Isobel.
You were the one that sells hats?
Yes. How do you do?
And is this Nigel, your boyfriend?
Yes, he sells paintings.
─ How do you do.
He's beautiful.
Are you allowed to drink, Miranda?
A glass of salt water, please.
A what?
A glass of salt water.
I say, that's a funny thing to drink.
But .. doctor's orders.
Well, I'd better ring for Charles.
[ Buzzer ]
She wears the most beautiful dress I've ever seen.
That's nice.
You must be somebody like her to get away with it though.
If you're like her you can get away with anything, it seems to me.
What?
[ Buzzer ]
Aren't you ever going to answer that bell?
Or do you want me to carry you in, Charles, darling?
How about a sandwich?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
You really liked that?
It's lovely. Why?
Well .. oh nothing, no.
You rang, sir?
─ Ah, Charles.
Bring Miss Trewella a glass of salt water.
Yes, sir.
Salt water, sir?
─ About a heaped dessert spoonful.
Very good, sir.
If I get a mouthful of salt water when I'm bathing ..
I'm practically sick on the spot.
Do you like the sea?
─ I love it.
So do I.
Well, I must say she has the most repellent manners.
Well they don't seem to repel everyone, apparently.
She's got some nice clothes, too.
Yes, I've been noticing them.
Salt water, sir.
─ Thank you, Charles.
You can go and get the car now.
Yes, sir.
Try some of this cocktail.
Oh, horrid.
Your salt water, Miranda.
Lovely.
I'll get you a drink, Nigel.
Is the drink alright, darling?
Do have another sandwich.
Oh Isobel, could I be a customer of yours?
Why yes, I suppose so.
I'd love to have a hat like that.
I don't wear one as a rule.
You look as though you always shopped in Paris.
Well it is surprising what you can find in Cornwall if you try.
You are not going to tell me that dress came off the peg in Pendar's stores?
This dress?
Why, no.
I ran it up myself.
I say, that's very clever of you, Miranda.
I wish Isobel could do a thing like that.
Yes, well I think we should be getting along.
Are we all set?
─ Why yes, Paul.
I think that would be a good idea.
Come along, darling.
Well, I'll carry you down, Miranda.
─ No, no. That's alright.
You would probably drop her.
─ Now don't be absurd.
I won't drop her.
I know exactly how to lift her.
─ Now look here.
Excuse me, sir.
Why, Charles. How nice of you.
Well, she's certainly a man's woman.
You know, there's something about that dress ..
It came from Manell, of course.
Yes.
I must pay Manell a visit tomorrow.
She's incredibly pretty.
She is pretty incredible.
Nurse.
Yes?
Have a sandwich, nurse.
They've got to be eaten up.
Oh, thank you.
I do feel rather peckish.
Miss Trewella is very different from what we were expecting.
I'm sure she is.
What's her trouble?
Paraplegia, perhaps.
Or maybe poliomyelitis.
Sounds awful.
It is an extraordinary case.
Do you think the doctor can cure her?
I wouldn't dare venture an opinion.
She is very pretty.
Enchanting.
Have another sandwich, nurse.
─ Oh, thanks.
I enjoy my food.
Are you .. are you really enjoying it, Miranda?
Oh yes.
I'm frightfully hot.
I can't wait for the drinks.
Me too.
─ What about you, Miranda?
Nigel, would you mind going ..
No, you go and have drink.
I'll wait here with Miranda.
But ..
─ Come along, darling.
Alright.
I'll bring you something back, Miranda.
Nigel.
─ Hmm?
I think you're very nice.
Do you?
You don't know me very well.
Oh yes I do.
Well how could you, after such a short time?
Knowing some people is a matter of instinct.
How long have you and
Isobel been engaged?
Exactly three days.
But it's taken me three years to talk her into it.
How could she resist you?
There is something about your face.
That makes me want to cry.
Oh yes. Yes, I often feel that way about it myself.
Such nice hands.
I'd .. I'd have known you were an artist.
Would you paint me?
Oh yes, I'd like to.
I'd like to very much.
─ Oh, would you?
Yes .. only ..
Would you mind not mentioning it to Isobel.
Oh, of course.
It will be a secret between you and me.
─ Yes.
Ooh!
What is it, dear?
─ Cockles.
Oh no, we can't.
─ Oh yes we can.
Come on, Miss. Make way for the lady.
─ Excuse me.
Yes, sweetie?
─ Two pints, please.
Two pints? You going to have a party?
─ No, just a snack.
You're a girl after my own heart.
Darling, you can't do this.
I've never touched a cockle in my life.
─ Why not?
I couldn't.
If you ask me, I don't think they're respectable.
I know winkles aren't.
Here.
Stop .. stop! You must stop.
Oh Miss. Let her have her fling.
She likes her cockles, same as me.
Quite right. More please.
Yes. Give her some more.
─ Yes.
I'd like to stand you cockles all round.
Come on, there. Here you are.
Here's some for you.
─ Have some vinegar.
I don't think the doctor would approve of this at all.
There's no harm in me having my portrait painted.
I don't know.
When I was sixteen I sat for a sculptor.
Only I wasn't exactly sitting.
He thinks we've gone to the museum.
Precisely. And I don't like deceiving him.
Mister Nigel Hood?
Oh yes. I'll call him.
Mister Hood!
There is no need for you to deceive the doctor.
You're quite right. I will keep my word.
I'll go to the museum.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh yes, yes.
Anything you want to know?
─ Oh, yes.
I was interested in the bandaging, young man.
Bandaging?
Look at the way that's put on. It's all wrong.
It's bound to slip in time.
Well, it's been there two thousand years.
Well it wouldn't satisfy the matron where I was trained.
Nigel.
─ Uhuh?
Who is that?
Oh, just a model.
I'm sure it is very like her.
You know, as a matter of fact it is.
Doesn't Isobel mind you doing things like that?
Oh, she doesn't see eye-to-eye with my painting at all.
She'd rather I designed posters and made a lot of money.
How are you going to paint me?
─ Ah, like ..
Like Venus rising out of the sea.
No.
Why did you say that?
I don't know.
I just see it that way.
Well, I don't want to be painted like Venus.
I don't want the sea in the picture at all.
Oh .. oh, alright.
Very well, Miranda.
I love the way you say Miranda.
Say it again.
Miranda.
Miranda.
Miranda.
Good gracious.
I've got pins and needles in my ..
What's that?
I've got pins and needles.
Oh. Well then, we'll stop.
Isobel is very lucky.
She doesn't seem think so.
I'm inclined to agree with her.
Nigel.
Did you ring, madam?
Yes. I want Charles.
Wouldn't I do, madam?
─ Not for what I want.
Charles.
Good morning, Miss.
Come in.
Close the door.
Are you busy today?
Well, Miss ..
I thought you might drive me to the zoo.
Where is Miss Trewella?
─ Out.             ─ Out?
But how?
─ Where have you been?
Well, I just nipped round the corner to my little cubbyhole. To feed my birds.
Well, the bird here has flown for the day.
Betty, where on earth is
Charles? And the car?
I must have it.
What are you thinking about?
Things I ..
Shouldn't be thinking, mainly.
About me?
Yes.
I'm afraid I'm getting very fond of you, Charles.
Well, I like you very much, too.
I think you are ..
Very pretty and ..
Cool and ..
Awfully cool.
I think we'd better be getting back.
─ Getting back?
It's 4 o'clock and they'll want ..
─ But I'm just getting to know you.
They'll be wanting the car and ..
Mr Manell, Mrs Martin is here.
─ I don't want to see anyone.
Good afternoon.
─ Oh my dear Mrs Martin.
This is wonderful. Do come in. I am absolutely distracted but distracted.
Did you like the dresses
I sent to Cornwall?
Not altogether.
─ Oh ..
Well it was such a rush and your husband gave such peculiar instructions.
My husband?
Oh but yes, of course.
He telephoned me from Cornwall.
Did he enjoy his holiday?
Oh yes, I should think never a dull moment.
If I thought that you were in league with Paul, I would ..
Mrs Martin, I forbid you to upset me.
You must go away.
Miss Brown, don't just stand there.
Bam .. bam .. bam ..
Bam .. bam .. bam ..
Bam .. bam .. bam ..
If that car ..
Alright, you start.
Darling, you've simply got to do something about Miranda.
I can't have Betty upset and Charles kidnapped.
But I've had to walk and run about all day for taxis. Do you think I want it?
Well then, you've got to put a stop to it.
Then there is another thing.
I've been having a little talk to Manell.
Manell? Oh ..
How is he?
Why did you buy the clothes for Miranda?
What are you up to?
I'm not up to anything.
Well, Miranda didn't have any clothes.
I take it she was running around naked down there?
You know Miranda can't run.
Well, if you ask me there is something very fishy about this case.
Clare.
Clare, I wish you'd trust me about this.
I do.
But I'm watching you as well.
Darling.
Shall I leave it here?
─ Yes.
Nurse.
─ Yes, dear?
You've been married.
Oh yes, love.
And when you were married, did you want to kill him?
Oh yes, dear. That's only normal.
You look a bit off colour.
I think I'll give you a hand with these things.
I was going to marry Charles.
But I don't know now.
Well.
He's been acting funny lately.
Funny, love? How?
Well, whenever I go near him or hold his hand or anything he ..
Says I'm hot.
Hot dear?
Yes, says I'm not cold enough.
That's the first time I've ever heard that as a complaint.
He used to be quite the reverse.
Well, I expect it comes from driving a motorcar.
I always think that makes men unnatural.
Any tea left?
Are your ears burning, young man?
My ears?
Evening, Charles.
─ Evening, sir.
Is Mrs Martin home?
No sir, she has gone to the cocktail party.
Charles, you can have the evening off.
Well, I was driving you and
Miss Trewella to the party, sir.
I'll drive her.
No, sir. That's quite alright, sir.
I said, have the evening off.
I'll drive her.
Won't Clare mind our not going to the party?
Oh, I called up.
I said I couldn't go because I had promised to take you to the theatre.
And when you tell her that we didn't go to the theatre ..
I won't tell her.
Oh Paul, look. A pool.
Can we stop?
Can we sit on the bank?
─ Hmm.
I've missed you, Paul.
─ Have you, Miranda?
Isn't it lovely to be alone again?
Well?
Unzip me, Paul.
Oh.
Certainly not.
But I will die if I .. if I don't get in the water.
Somebody might .. see you.
Does that matter?
It's heaven.
Come in and get me.
─ Just coming.
You're terribly late.
Oh, Clare. There you are.
I was hoping not to wake you.
I gathered that.
It was all my fault, Clare.
We .. went for a spin.
Is it raining?
─ Raining? No.
I only wondered.
Well, I'll just take Miranda along to her room.
Goodnight, Clare.
Darling.
It's very flattering, Nigel.
It's far from doing you justice.
You make me forget Isobel.
Nigel.
Hmm?
I'm going away soon.
Oh .. Miranda.
But I've got a present for you.
There.
Oh .. oh, thank you.
Thank you, Miranda.
What is it?
It's a lock of my hair.
A lock of your hair?
Yes. You wear it round your neck.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Miranda.
But .. couldn't I just keep it in my pocket?
My .. my breast pocket.
No.
It's a token.
A token of ..?
Of what?
Of a love.
That might have been.
Darling, are you still angry with me?
Of course not. I told you,
I've got a headache.
If ..
If Miranda wants to come out tonight, I'd ..
I'd like you to come too.
No, Paul. Not tonight.
Oh, Clare. Please.
No. I'm going to lie down.
There is no reason why you shouldn't take Miranda out.
Is there?
No.
If you .. if you say so.
The doctor has been asking what attracts you so much to the museum.
What did you say?
I passed it off.
You are a dear.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Well, it's a case of what you do in spite of me.
Still, I was young once.
At hospital dances I used to do the gallop with the house surgeon.
And one year I danced a Mazurka.
A solo.
I can't very well do that.
It's a foreign sort of dance, the Mazurka. But very graceful.
[ Singing: ]
"Ta da da da .."
Doctor! You made me jump.
Was that it, nurse?
Well really, I think ..
Oh dear, oh dear.
Paul.
─ Hmm?
Does Clare know about me yet?
No, of course not.
Well, it won't be long before she does.
Oh, we'll keep the secret.
I can't help thinking about aunt
Augusta and what they did to her.
Paul.
─ Uhuh.
It's the opera again tonight.
Will you take me there?
Oh, it means I'll have to change again.
Paul, please take me for a special reason. Will you?
Alright.
Whatever is this?
They're for you because you are such a dear to me.
I want you to have them now.
But my dear ..
─ I dived for them myself.
Then they are real pearls?
But I can't.
Oh, Miss Miranda.
I've never had a present like this in all my life.
I'm so happy.
Thank you.
Why .. why, Isobel.
What's up?
─ What's up?
Are you surprised to see me?
Oh no .. no, no. Of course not. No.
Well, aren't you going to ask me up?
Yes, yes. Of course.
Isn't this a little bit late for you to be coming here?
I just thought I'd come out and see you.
Oh.
What on earth are you cooking?
Oh .. my supper.
It smells terrible.
What have you got there, Nigel?
Oh, it's nothing, nothing. Just something I've been working on.
May I see?
─ No. I'd rather you didn't.
Oh Nigel. And you're always saying
I don't take any interest in your work.
Yes. Well ..
Oh, alright then.
Miranda.
So this is where she goes on her sightseeing tour.
I know that you don't like her.
I don't dislike her, but I think she is rather peculiar.
If you don't see eye-to-eye with people.
You always think they are peculiar.
Why, you even think I'm eccentric.
You've told me so for years.
"Get your hair cut, Nigel.
Straighten your tie, Nigel."
"You can't wear sandals, Nigel."
Talking like that, I think you are odd in the head.
There you are! I've bats in my head now, have I?
Well, I'm glad I have.
If you don't like me as I am, you can ..
You can do the other thing.
Are you trying to quarrel with me?
Now, what have I done? What have I said?
It's the accumulation of what you've been doing and saying for the past 3 years.
It's taken you long enough to find out about it.        ─ Far too long.
I know now. We're utterly unsuited to each other.
Oh .. so that's it.
It's this wretched Mona Lisa you've been painting.
Now you leave her out of it.
─ Well it is, isn't it.
Oh, I wasn't born yesterday.
It's a pity you can't throw it at me.
You never thought it was good enough.
─ Oh!
You and Miranda!
Now look what you've done.
It's like I said.
Better to find out our mistakes now.
Instead of later.
You don't know what you're saying.
You're not even the same person anymore.
Well, I'm not deceiving you anyway.
Not now, you're not.
Because I found out about you.
I know.
And I'm sorry about it.
But it's just that.
Well.
This is something stronger than me.
Why Betty, whatever is the matter?
It's Charles, madam.
Our engagement is off.
Oh, Betty.
All on account of Miss Trewella.
─ What?
Things have been going on between them.
─ What sort of things?
I don't know, but he's wearing her love-token.
A love-token?
Yes. A lock of her hair made into a sort of pendant.
Do you mean to tell me that Charles is actually wearing a pendant?
Yes, madam.
─ Around his neck?
Where else could he wear it?
He says she wants looking after.
I reckon she does, too.
What do you mean?
─ Well.
If you'll forgive my saying so,
I think she a bit funny in the head.
For one thing, I think she sleeps the whole night through in a cold bath.
She what?
Yes, I can see the water being run in at night and let out again in the morning.
And the other morning when I cleaned out the bath I found a bit of seaweed in it.
Very peculiar.
And then there is another thing about her that isn't quite nice.
She never wears any panties.
Never wears panties?
─ No.
Plenty of other underclothes she has, but not a single pair of those.
I think there is something fishy about Miss Trewella.
"M."
"M-e."
"M-e-r."
"Mermaid!"
"A mythical creature, half woman, half fish."
All these lovely dresses.
All the lights.
I wish I could stay here forever.
I'm afraid it's impossible, Miranda.
Yes.
Could you get me a glass of water before it starts again?
I'll try.
[ Miranda singing: ]
[ Miranda singing: ]
[ Miranda singing: ]
[ Miranda singing: ]
[ Miranda singing: ]
Now I can say I've sung in Covent Garden.
Yes.
Good evening. I want to see Miss Trewella, please.
Nigel.
Is anything the matter?
─ Is Miranda here?
No, I'm afraid she's out.
Oh, I .. I see.
Clare .. Isobel and I. We've packed up.
Because of Miranda?
You know?
It's an epidemic.
─ What do you mean?
Oh, nothing.
I guessed you'd been seeing her. That's all.
I think you're making a frightful mistake.
The fact that she's an invalid makes absolutely no difference to me.
Well, I admit she's very fascinating.
Have you asked her to marry you?
No .. I haven't been in a position to ask her yet, but ..
I've hinted at it, though.
She hasn't said "yes" by any slip of the tongue?
No, but I think she might.
About Miranda's legs.
I've already told you, it makes absolutely no difference.
No, no, no. You misunderstand me.
Her legs, Nigel.
What are they like?
Well really, I haven't the slightest idea.
I'm surprised that you could ever ask me such a question.
[ Doorbell ]
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to call so late, madam.
─ Come in, Charles.
Well, I used the front door because ..
You didn't want to run into Betty.
Yes, madam.
I want to see Miss Trewella, madam.
─ Oh, I'm afraid she's out, Charles.
Well.
Would you mind if I waited in the hall?
I want to see her rather urgently.
Nonsense, Charles. Come in and wait in the sitting-room.
Well, I gather that your call is a social one. Come on in.
Did I hear you say that you are wanting to see Miss Trewella?
That's right, sir.
─ Oh.
Is she expecting you?
Well, no sir. It's in the nature of a surprise.
Oh, I see. Oh.
I am .. I'm waiting to see her myself.
Is she expecting you, sir?
No, no.
Two surprises.
Is it asking too much for you to put off seeing Miss Trewella until the morning?
I'm afraid it would, sir.
But you can't wait here to see her now.
Yes, sir. Under the circumstances, I can.
I'm going to ask Miss
Trewella to be my wife.
What?
Your wife?
─ Yes, sir.
Unless I've mistaken the signs, I rather think her answer is going to be "Yes".
Oh .. oh, do you?
Oh, how extraordinary.
It may interest you, but that's exactly what I'll ask Miss Trewella myself.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid you don't stand a chance.
Well, you see sir, she likes the practical type of man.
Like myself, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
It's a fact she hates the practical type of man and efficiency and all that rot.
She told me.
─ Perhaps, sir.
I'm afraid you've got it all wrong. She told me.
Oh, Charles. Charles, I'm sorry. I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment.
You see, actions count for more than words.
That's alright, sir.
Charles.
Did she tell you it was a token of love which ..
Which might have been, sir?
As a matter of fact, she did.
Well, what will you two men be up to next?
Sugar, Charles?
─ No thank you, madam.
Nigel?
I must be getting along, madam.
─ Yes, I won't wait either.
But .. well, she'll be back any moment.
Could I .. could I have an envelope?
Yes, of course.
There is one in the study.
Would you mind returning this to Miss Trewella, madam?
Delighted to, Charles.
Thank you, madam.
Charles.
─ Yes, madam?
There is another thing, if you'll excuse my asking.
Miss Trewella's legs.
What are they like?
Madam?.
Oh surely you know.
Certainly not, madam. I ..
I hope I always behaved like a gentleman.
You'd be surprised at some gentlemen, Charles.
Yes, madam.
Ah, I think I'll go and have a word with Betty, madam.
Good luck.
Oh, thank you, madam.
[ Doorbell ]
It's alright, Charles. I'll go.
Oh come in, my dear.
Clare, Nigel and I have had the most awful row and broken off our engagement.
Yes, I know.
─ You know?
Then you know it's because of Miranda?
Yes my dear, I do. I know everything.
Oh, what a fool I've been.
It was a good portrait, too.
The best he's done.
Oh, I must have been crazy to destroy it.
Now, he'll just start all over again.
Oh, I don't think he will somehow.
I do love him.
I love him terribly.
Isn't that silly of me.
Yes, it is.
It's all my fault. If it wasn't for the shop we'd have been married years ago.
Oh Nigel, that was mean of you.
I'm sorry about the portrait.
That's alright.
I'm going to turn it into a sunset.
Are you sure she's really seen it?
─ Quite.
In future, I'd better stick to still life.
Here are my keys. Take them and do what you like to every hat in the place.
Isobel ..
─ Please take them.
It still won't come off.
It doesn't have to, does it?
Look, do you mind going upstairs?
I'm terribly sorry but I'll explain it all to you tomorrow.
Oh well.
Alright.
Hello.
Hello, Clare.
─ Hello, Clare.
How is the head?
─ Oh, gone entirely.
Have you had a good time?
It's been a wonderful evening.
What are you doing?
Oh, only the crossword.
─ But you hate them.
Oh, just killing time, you know.
Unfortunately, I got stuck.
What do you want to know?
A seven letter word beginning with "M".
A creature of the species "Manatee".
Manatee.
All it says here is "an aquatic mammal".
"A mythical creature half-woman, half fish."
"A sea cow."
A sea-cow?
─ Miranda.
She knows .. she's been spying on me.
You're not going to call me a sea-cow and get away with it.
Then you ..
Really are a ..
─ Yes.
Miranda is .. a mermaid.
But if you think you're going to take a peek at my tail, you're much mistaken.
Am I awake?
Now she thinks I'm a nightmare.
I'm hot.
I want a glass of water.
Very well.
You've hated me ever since
I set tail in this house.
No, I ..
Phew.
Is there anything I can do, doctor?
─ No, she's a little over-tired, is all.
Nurse Carey will be back any moment.
─ When she is, tell her to go to .. bed.
You can all go to bed.
I don't want her to be disturbed.
I ..
I wonder what's upset her.
─ I should have thought you would know.
Oh Betty.
No, you can't drop me one moment then pick me up the next.
But all I want is a little warmth and comfort.
Warmth?
The trouble with you is you don't know what you do want.
Well, I've failed.
I'm just a fish out of water.
You haven't failed, Miranda. You've already had two visitors tonight.
Nigel and Charles.
What did they want?
Well, I think they both wanted to marry you.
Both of them?
Isn't it absurd?
Were they here together?
Yes.
I shall never be able to face them again.
They asked me to return these to you.
My tokens.
How funny human-beings are about presents.
Paul!
Oh .. Paul.
My dear, it's a wonder you've any hair left.
They are only made from combings.
Well, aren't there any men under the sea who you could give them to?
Oh yes, a few.
But they have little eyes and flat noses. Most unattractive.
That's why we're practically extinct.
Clare.
You can see my tail if you want to.
Oh.
Sometime, perhaps.
It's quite pretty when it's wet, isn't it, Paul.
Oh charming. Perfectly charming.
Have you met any of Miranda's sisters?
─ No. No.
They're at Majorca until the spring.
I'm going there too.
I want to be somewhere lovely in May.
I'll lie in my bath now.
Give me a few minutes, Clare. And then you can come through and see my tail.
By then, it will be a little less dehydrated looking.
Put me in my chair, Paul.
Now I can manage.
─ You're quite sure?
Kiss me, Paul.
Now you'd better go back to Clare.
Yes.
Sorry she found out about me.
It doesn't matter.
Well darling, that's settled then.
I feel much happier now you know it.
But we can't keep this to ourselves.
Darling, we must.
Paul, it is our duty to make it public.
No, Clare
It wouldn't be fair to Miranda.
But Paul ..
No, I promised Miranda it would be a secret, and I'll not go back on my word.
Paul.            ─ Huh?
─ Her tail.
Is it very odd?
Not really, just like ..
Oh .. they've gone have they?
Just a snack, dear.
Would you like me to come in with you?
─ Certainly not.
Miranda.
Miranda?
Paul!
She's gone.
─ What?
Gone. And her chair has gone, too.
There she is.
Miranda, come back! Wait!
Miranda!
Quickly, Paul.
Miranda!
Stop, Miranda!
Come back!
Oh Paul.
─ She's gone.
Will she be alright?
─ Hmm.
I've seen her swim. She'll be alright once she makes the open sea.
Maybe it's just as well.
Next year I'm going to come fishing with you.
I don't think I shall want to go fishing ñext year.
No more bachelor holidays?
Never again.
Poor Miranda.
She'll be happy basking in the sunshine in Majorça.
Oh yes, Majorça.
I wonder why she säid she wanted to be somewhere lovely in May.
I wonder.
T-G
T-G
Now will you give me my chalk?
Try that again and I'll put you on solitary confinement, you would-be Frankenstein.
Don't profane his name with your dirty lips.
He was a genius in whose footsteps
I will follow when I get out of here.
"When you get out."
If I have anything to say about it, you'll never get out.
But I will.
Now, friend Daniel, shall we go on with our work?
Now, this brain is taken from the man and transplanted into the skull of the dog, but given the mind of a human being...
Now, Frankenstein would have severed the spinal cord here, but I'm not certain that he was right.
Could Frankenstein have made me like other men?
He gave life to a body that he made from parts of other bodies that had died.
Yes, Daniel, he could have made you like other men.
Dr. Niemann, did you know Frankenstein?
No. But my brother, who assisted him, learned his secrets.
And before he died, he passed them on to me.
Then you could give me a new body.
If I had Frankenstein's records to guide me,
I could give you a perfect body.
Hyah! Hyah!
Try it again, Herman!
Now, all together!
We could help you.
My arms are strong.
Well, thank you, whoever you are.
Take the front wheel. We'll take this.
Try it again! We have help!
Push!
Hyah! Hyah!
May I offer you the warmth of my living wagon?
Thank you.
So you're a merchant that's been held for ransom by mountain bandits.
For the better part of three months.
And that's your servant?
Do you doubt me?
It's a doubting world, kind sir.
As I, Professor Bruno Lampini, have reason to know.
I have a collection of the world's most astounding horrors.
When I exhibit them, what do I get?
Doubts, jeers, cries of "Fake! Fake!"
You expect your patrons to believe that the skeleton you show them is really that of Count Dracula?
I, Lampini, took it.
Pardon me. Borrowed it from the cellar of Dracula's castle in the Carpathian Mountains.
With my own two hands I spread upon the floor of its coffin a layer of soil taken from its birthplace.
So that by proxy, shall we say, the skeleton of his earthbound spirit might lie at peace within his grave.
Until the withdrawal of the wooden stake from its heart set Dracula free again to satisfy his unholy appetite for blood.
At night, the giant bat would seek its victims.
But before sunrise, return to the safety of his coffin.
Aye, a single ray of sunlight falling upon a vampire would make him helpless.
Do you ever exhibit your show in Visaria?
Visaria...
No. That's a town that doesn't care for horrors.
They had one of their own some 15 years ago when a Dr. Niemann tried to give a dog the mind of a human being.
They threw him in prison because he, like Frankenstein, used bodies of the newly-dead to carry on his work.
Is old Hussman still alive?
He's now the mayor of Reigelberg.
Are you going there, by any chance?
Oh, later on in the season.
It's a small place. Too far away to make a special trip profitable.
Nevertheless, that is where you are going.
I am not going to Reigelberg.
Then Daniel and I will go alone.
No. No!
Now the driver.
Well, you seem worried, friend Daniel.
If they search the ruins of the prison, our bodies will not be found.
We should hide.
And so we shall, but in the open.
All the protection of a traveling show.
I as Lampini, you as my assistant.
Free to move on towards those for whom I have unloving memories.
The ones who sent you to prison?
Strauss, Ullman, and old Hussman, the burgomaster.
Yes, friend Daniel, we will travel to the village of Reigelberg and pay our respects to the Burgomaster.
Your move, Inspector.
That's a neat trap you've got me into.
Checkmate. Put it in the book, Inspector.
- Grandfather?
- Yes.
He's here, Carl.
As a man, I admire you.
As burgomaster, I respect you.
But as a chess player,
Herr Hussman, I hate you.
Did you lose again, Inspector?
It serves you right.
I told you not to play with him.
He always wins, don't you, you old darling?
I hope we're not breaking up your game, but Carl and I have decided...
She means she has decided.
To take in the midnight show of the horror exhibit down at the crossroads.
Spooks, ghouls, vampires.
Get his hat and coat, Carl.
You're going with us.
To stare at a lot of idiotic humbugs?
Not I, my dear. I put my weary bones where they belong, in bed.
Your hat and coat.
I'm not going!
You'd better give in, Grandad.
These American girls can talk you into anything.
That's all they do, talk.
- What? What did you say?
- Aaah!
Now, now, darling.
Remember your blood pressure.
That's the man I married.
Talk, talk, talk, talk!
I can never get a word in edgewise.
Here, put this on.
No.
And no arguments.
- Come along, Inspector.
- No. No.
- You're coming with us, too.
- Oh, but I...
And I don't want any arguments from you either.
Come along. Come on.
Persuasive little minx, isn't she?
Brr! I'm all over goose pimples.
And properly so, you little goose.
Now, don't be grouchy. This is fun.
Master, police inspector.
It's all right, Daniel.
We have our permit.
Oh.
Now, there is something
I could really use.
I wonder where I could get one.
What for?
Just the thing to keep the wife under control.
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Step this way to gaze upon an exhibit absolutely unparalleled in the realms of showmanship.
No doubt there are some among you who will doubt the truth of what I am about to say or doubt the reality of what you are about to see.
But believe me, my friends, this is no fake.
Before your very eyes is all that remains of a vampire.
One of the world's undead.
Dare I but remove this stake from where his heart once beat, and he would rise from the grave within which he lies and turn into a bat, a vampire bat, who'd feed hideously upon the living, whose veins pulsate with warm and vibrant blood.
Ladies and gentlemen, the actual skeleton of Count Dracula, the vampire!
Rubbish. Sheer rubbish.
I don't know, Herr Hussman.
There are many people hereabouts who still believe in the old legend.
Aye, sir. It is true.
I'm surprised at you people.
You seem to doubt what I say,
Herr Burgomaster.
Bats. Vampires.
A stake driven through a skeleton's heart.
Gibberish. Every word of it.
Furthermore, my friends, one single ray of sunlight falling upon a vampire will destroy him.
Say, who are you?
My name is Lampini.
You're not the Lampini I ran out of this area three years ago?
That was my brother, recently deceased.
You remind me of someone.
Someone I can't quite recall.
Perhaps you will remember later,
Herr Burgomaster.
Yes, perhaps.
Drop the stick from your hand.
Drop it.
But if you move,
I'll send your soul back to the limbo of eternal waiting.
Do as I ask, and I will serve you.
I will protect the earth upon which you lie so that before sunrise, your coffin will always be ready for you.
For that,
I will do whatever you wish.
I hope I haven't spoiled your evening for you, Inspector.
As a matter of fact,
I found it most interesting.
But I say good night here.
- Good night, Carl.
- Good night, Inspector.
- Mrs. Hussman.
- Good night.
- See you in the morning, sir.
- Good night, Hans.
Don't get lost in the fog.
Well, you certainly picked a night for it, my pet.
It's like being wrapped in the arms of a gigantic ghost.
Ghosts, vampires!
Can't you talk about anything else?
Listen.
If you're going toward the inn, may I offer you the accommodation of my coach?
You don't have to say that twice.
Pardon me. I'm Carl Hussman and this is Mrs. Hussman.
We are here on our honeymoon.
My congratulations.
And this is my grandfather.
How do you do?
Herr Hussman.
Permit me to introduce myself.
I am Baron Latos from Transylvania.
Well, glad to know you, Baron.
May I suggest that you join me for a bottle of wine at the inn?
In the nature of, shall we say, a celebration, Mrs. Hussman?
Well, that's a wonderful idea if Grandad doesn't mind.
Yes. A glass of wine will warm my blood.
But you will accept our hospitality, Baron.
The wine of the country from my cellar.
Thank you, Herr Hussman.
Driver, stop at the Hussman home.
Oh, driver, go around to the kitchen.
Ask the cook to make you some coffee.
Thank you, Herr Burgomeister.
I drink to love.
A union to last throughout eternity.
A love free from all material needs.
I'll drink to that lack of material needs myself, Baron, but not till I raid the wine cellar, I won't.
Excuse me, darling. Be right back, Baron.
You admire my ring?
When I look at it,
I see glimpses of a strange world.
A world of people who are dead and yet alive.
It is the place from which I've just returned.
It frightens me.
Wear it.
It will drive away your fears.
It's too large.
It will become smaller.
No.
I'm afraid.
Take it back.
It is the bond that links us together.
I see your world more clearly now.
I'm no longer afraid.
I will come for you before the dawn.
Now, as I was saying...
I haven't the remotest idea what I was saying.
I've been asleep.
I must apologize, Baron.
It must have been the wine.
It's quite all right, Herr Hussman.
Oh, here we are.
It's very late. I hadn't realized we talked so long. I must be leaving.
Well, it's been a swell party, Baron.
We'll save this for next time.
Good night, Baron.
Thank you for your hospitality,
Herr Hussman.
- Not at all. Good night.
- Good night.
Why, Rita, aren't you going to bid me good night?
Good night, Grandfather.
Good night, my dear.
Lampini. Lampini.
- Good night, Baron.
- Good night, sir.
Lampini.
Niemann.
Of course.
Dr. Niemann.
Well, it turned out to be fun after all, didn't it, darling?
It's a wonderful night.
The darkness beckons to me.
Another world.
The world I see is far away, yet very near.
A strange and beautiful world in which one may be dead and yet alive.
Rita, what is it?
What's happened to you?
I'm going away.
Dracula crest.
Like the one on the coffin.
Where did you get it?
From Baron Latos.
Baron Latos?
We've got to get it off.
I want to go there, Carl.
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Connect me with Inspector Arnz. Hurry!
- Hello?
- Hello, Inspector. This is Carl Hussman.
- My grandfather has been killed.
- Herr Hussman?
Wounds on the neck? Want kind of wounds?
Two small punctures like teeth marks.
I'll be right over.
Rita!
Rita! Rita!
Arnz!
Arnz!
Arnz!
My wife, in that carriage.
Master! The police. They're after us.
Look, Master.
I think they're after Dracula.
There's one way to stop them.
Yes.
Aah!
Fejos, the police!
Ah, Herr Inspector, you missed Ilonka's dance.
She's pretty, too.
I will have her dance again especially for you.
Not in the village of
Frankenstein, you won't.
We've had nothing but stealing since you came here.
The Burgomeister says you're to move on.
But, Herr Inspector...
No arguments. Break camp and get out.
All right, the show's over.
Go back to your homes.
Oh, Daniel.
Now drive on.
We'll camp beyond those trees.
What've you got here?
A chamber of horrors.
The Burgomaster won't grant you a permit, so pack up and be on your way.
But why?
There's nothing in my exhibit to offend anyone.
We've had enough horrors around here.
Do you see those ruins?
Our village has been quiet and peaceful since the dam broke and swept the Wolf Man and the Frankenstein monster to their destruction several years ago.
No one ever mentions that place, nor does anyone ever go near it.
That's why you can't exhibit here.
We want nothing to remind us of something that we've been trying to forget.
But we've come a long way and the horses are tired.
It's very late.
Could we at least rest here until tomorrow?
No, you've got to move on.
All right, Daniel, we'll move on.
Hand over the money the villagers gave you.
Only your share.
All of it.
When I joined you, it was agreed that I keep half.
Give me the money.
If you try to rob me,
I'll tell the police that it's you who's been doing the stealing around here!
I'll thrash you within an inch of your life.
Let me go, you smelly pig!
No, Fejos! No! No! No!
No, I say! Fejos!
Daniel! Daniel!
Do you want to bring the police on us?
Go and get him out of here before he kills him.
Master, she's hurt.
May I take her with us?
No, we only have tonight to search for the Frankenstein records.
Please, Master, she's hurt.
All right, if it will keep you in your right senses.
Are you awake?
You've nothing to be afraid of.
Now I remember.
Who are you?
I'm Daniel.
I'm with Professor Lampini's show.
Here, I brought you some tea.
It will make you feel better.
That was nice of you.
Are you the one that helped me?
It made me mad when he whipped you.
But he can't hurt you anymore.
They've gone.
Leaving me a hundred miles from nowhere.
No, but we're going to Visaria.
You can travel with us.
You can sleep here and talk to me when I drive.
I get so lonesome when I have no one to talk to.
You don't know me very well.
I might talk you to death.
Your name's Ilonka, isn't it?
You know all about me, don't you, Daniel?
I watched you dance.
Did you?
Did you like me?
You're pretty.
You're afraid of me, aren't you?
Afraid of you?
If you weren't, you'd come up here where I could see you better.
But you will talk to me sometimes?
Won't you?
Of course I will.
You've been kind to me and I like you.
Daniel. Daniel!
Yes, Master.
You come with me.
I've found a way into the ruins.
Master, if we find the Frankenstein records, will you make me like other men?
To please your little gypsy girl, friend Daniel, I'll make you an Adonis.
Here's a book, Master!
Does it...
Help me, Master!
Daniel, are you hurt?
No, Master.
Evidently the force of the flood burst through that wall and washed everything into the cave beyond.
We'd better look for the records in there.
A glacial ice cavern.
The Wolf Man.
Master, over there!
The undying monster.
The triumphant climax of Frankenstein's genius and the Wolf Man.
They may know where the records are, friend Daniel.
We'll set them free and they will help us.
Master! Master!
Who are you?
Why have you freed me from the ice that imprisoned the beast that lived within me?
Why?
Perhaps to help you, Mr. Talbot.
No earthly power can help those that are marked by the sign of the pentagram.
You came here to ask Frankenstein for help, didn't you?
Yes, but I was too late.
He was dead.
I wanted to die, too.
Nevertheless, when Dr. Mannering trailed you here from England, you asked him for help.
I did, but he became more interested in the monster than he was in me.
When the villagers learned that he had brought the monster back to life, they blew up the darn.
These frozen waters have held you here all these years.
And now you've brought me back to a life of misery.
With each full moon,
I turn into a werewolf.
I kill.
I want to die.
Only death can bring me release.
You don't have to die, my boy. You're wrong.
I can help you.
How? How can you help me?
I, too, am a doctor.
A scientist like Frankenstein.
Do you know where he kept his records?
I think so.
Show me those records and I'll build a new brain for you.
I'll lift this curse from you forever.
He wanted life and strength.
I wanted only death.
Here we are.
The answer to both your problems lies here.
But in my laboratory in Visaria,
I have the equipment to restore his strength.
Then I must wait until we reach Visaria.
You must be patient.
The horses are harnessed, Master.
Can you drive?
Why, yes.
Then take the road to Visaria.
Master, is he going to drive all the time?
Yes, I need you here.
We must apply hot compresses.
The ice has seriously damaged his tissues.
What's the matter, Daniel, you got bugs?
You're not Daniel.
No, Daniel's back with the doctor.
Who are you?
Just the driver.
Are you going to Visaria with us?
Yes.
I promised Daniel I'd keep him company while he drove.
But I'll talk to you if you want me to.
My name's Ilonka. What's yours?
Lawrence.
Lawrence?
Do they call you Larry?
They used to.
Larry! Larry!
I have something for you.
Look.
Pretty.
What's the matter with you?
We've been together three days, and you haven't smiled once.
I think I'd like you better if you smiled.
Now don't start barking at me.
There's a nice big smile for you.
Now give me one.
You see how easy it is?
Then why are you always so sad?
I wish you'd tell me.
Why?
Because I like you.
Tell me. Maybe I can help.
No one could help me.
Daniel?
Hurry up with that water.
You going to stand there all day?
Get started.
We've lost too much time already.
Master, why can't I drive part of the time?
But Talbot bothers me with his everlasting impatience.
We must get the monster to Visaria before further changes make restoration more difficult.
The desiccation of the tissues has gone further than I thought
It's not as bad as I feared.
Our equipment is still usable.
We must go to work and get it in shape as quickly as possible.
Turn on the steam.
Steam will soften the tissues so that the high-frequency current will go through them.
How long will it take?
A day. Perhaps longer.
Why must you do that now?
You have everything you need here.
Operate on me.
I've yet to find a way of combining
Frankenstein's technique with my own.
The moon will be full tonight.
You know what that means.
I can't stand to go through that torture again. I tell you, I can't!
An operation now would be a failure.
It would leave you exactly as you are.
You must wait.
Wait!
All right, Daniel.
Master, Talbot is big and strong.
Will you give me...
Forget Talbot. We have work to do.
But, Master, you promised...
All in due time, Daniel.
Tonight we call on my old friends,
Ullman and Strauss.
Herr Strauss.
Yes. What do you want?
Remember me? I'm Dr. Niemann.
Dr. Niemann?
Yes, Frederick.
Come with me.
Pardon me, Herr Ullman.
Do you know Herr Strauss?
The garrulous gentleman who testified that he saw me take a body from its grave.
We don't forget, Herr Strauss, do we?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is that more comfortable?
Niemann, I've saved 15,000 marks...
Since you testified for the state to save your miserable hide?
Let me go, Niemann.
Let me go and the money is yours.
Every bit of it.
15,000 marks.
A thousand for every year that I spent in the stinking, slimy dungeon.
You bargain poorly, Herr Ullman.
Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't...
Kill my trusted old assistant?
Why, no.
I'm going to repay you for betraying me.
I'm going to give that brain of yours a new home in the skull of the Frankenstein monster.
As for you, Strauss,
I'm going to give you the brain of the Wolf Man so that all your waking hours will be spent in untold agony, awaiting the full of the moon, which will change you into a werewolf.
The plasma must flow at exactly that rate.
No more, no less.
If there's any change, call me.
- Master.
- Yes?
Now that I've helped you with Strauss and Ullman, will you give Talbot's body to me?
What?
He's big. He's strong.
Talbot's body is the perfect home for the monster's brain, which I will add to and subtract from in my experiments.
Master, you made me a promise.
No!
You think I'd wreck the work of a lifetime because you're in love with a gypsy girl?
I've killed four men for you.
Do as I say or I'll never help you.
Larry!
Larry!
Daniel, you frightened me.
Have you seen Larry?
What's the matter? Don't you like Larry?
You used to smile at me sometimes, before he joined us.
Why, Daniel, I believe you're jealous.
You love him, don't you?
He's in some kind of trouble, I think.
I want to help him.
You do love him.
But he doesn't know it.
It wouldn't make any difference to him if he did.
Why not? Why wouldn't it make any difference to him?
Do you see that?
It's a star.
A five-pointed star.
- The pentagram.
- The pentagram!
The sign of the beast.
"Even a man who's pure in heart
"and says his prayers by night..."
"Will become a werewolf when the wolf bane blooms
"and the moon is full and bright."
He's a werewolf.
Oh, no!
No, not him. Not Larry!
You're lying! You're lying to me!
No.
No, I'm trying to protect you.
Stay away from him.
When the moon is full again, he'll turn.
And he'll kill.
He'll kill.
I don't believe you.
You're making it all up because you're jealous.
I hate you.
You're mean and you're ugly!
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!
She hates me because
I'm an ugly hunchback.
If it wasn't for you,
I'd have Talbot's body.
Yes, Mrs. Strauss.
Yes, yes, yes, Mrs. Strauss.
What about our beers, Hoffman?
At once, Herr Burgomeister.
I must go now, Mrs. Strauss. Good day.
I don't know. I don't know.
The housewives, they ask me where their husbands are all the time.
What are you muttering about, Hoffman?
Strauss hasn't been home since yesterday.
His wife's very worried about him.
Sleeping off a drunk probably.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
Ullman hasn't been home since last night either.
Neither has Braun, the storekeeper.
That's odd.
When one man doesn't come home, you think nothing of it.
When three men disappear overnight, particularly in a small town like Visaria, you begin to wonder.
Inspector! I found Herr Braun.
Out in the woods.
- He's dead.
- Dead?
What do you make of it, Doctor?
The jugular vein is severed.
Not cut, but torn apart as though by powerful teeth.
A werewolf!
We'll all be murdered.
Heaven help us.
I must warn my wife and children.
Schwartz, Meier, come back here.
I forbid that you spread such talk.
What do you want to do?
Drive folks from Visaria and ruin our village forever?
I'm ashamed of you, all of you, believing in such idiotic superstitions.
Then how do you explain that?
And how about Strauss?
And Ullman. What happened to them?
If there's a werewolf, our people should know about it.
I think so too, Herr Burgomeister.
Our children aren't safe.
If there's a werewolf, let's find him.
Aye, search for the werewolf!
All right! All right!
Organize your searching parties.
The inspector will head one group,
Schwartz another, and Meier a third.
Find your werewolf.
"Even a man who is pure at heart and says his prayers by night..."
Then you know?
Daniel told me.
Oh, Larry.
Last night, I killed a man.
You didn't know what you were doing.
But I did.
I wanted to kill and I knew that I wanted to.
Tonight the moon will rise again and I'll become that beast.
I'll kill again.
Can't Dr. Niemann do anything for you?
Ask him, Larry. Ask him.
Oh, he says that he can, but he keeps putting me off.
I don't trust him.
I can't go on waiting and killing and waiting.
I...
I want forgetfulness, peace.
I want to help you.
I'll do anything.
When that spell comes over me,
I'd kill anyone.
I won't let you.
I won't let you out of my sight.
I might even kill you.
I couldn't help myself.
I'm not afraid.
It's no use, Ilonka.
Only death can bring us peace of mind.
And a werewolf doesn't just die.
He must be killed.
Killed by a silver bullet.
Fired by the hand of one who loves him enough to understand.
He must be killed.
Killed by a silver bullet.
Fired by the hand of someone who loves him enough to understand.
Turbines.
Now the generator.
Check the megavoltage.
Twenty-five thousand.
Increase to 50.
The electronic bombardment will penetrate...
Listen to me, Niemann.
You promised that if I found the Frankenstein records, you'd cure me of this curse.
I found them, gave them to you.
Now it's time for you to keep your part of the bargain.
My boy, you must have patience.
I've waited long enough.
Last night I suffered the tortures of the damned.
I killed a man.
Tonight the moon will be full again.
Now you stop whatever you're doing and operate on me or I swear, I'll...
Would you destroy your only hope of release?
Well, any sign of your werewolf yet?
We're early for him, I guess.
Oh, so he appears on schedule like a train, is that it?
Increase your megavoltage to 100,000.
Danger, Master! Danger, Master!
Danger!
Decrease!
Hello, Schwartz! Ja, come here quick!
What's the matter? What is it?
Lights at Dr. Niemann's.
Weird lights. Flashing all over the old place.
- At Dr. Niemann's?
- Yeah, we saw them from the road.
His place has been closed for 15 years.
We better investigate.
Larry?
Go away.
No, Larry, let me in!
Go away, I tell you.
Tell Talbot I'm ready for him.
Master.
Master.
The Wolf Man.
The only thing I ever loved.
It wouldn't have happened if you kept faith with me.
I served you well, Master.
Remember Lampini? Strauss?
Ullman?
Now you're going to join them.
Aaah!
Search the castle and grounds.
The Frankenstein monster!
The Frankenstein monster!
Can't stand fire.
Aah!
Set fire to the marsh grass.
Drive him back into the bog.
Don't go this way. Quicksands! Quicksands!
Not this way. Quicksands!
Not that way. Quicksands! Quicksands!
Dear great Grandma...
...and dear great Grandpa...
...this is for both of you.
Dear great Grandma...
...and dear great Grandpa...
...we all love you.
This is from the family on your olden annie.
Golden, darling.
Golden?
Golden anniversary.
Yes. That means they've been married 50 years. on your Golden anniversary.
Very good, Sylvia. Don't be upset.
Are you ready, Amelia?
- Yes, Andrew.
Believe me if all those
Endearing young charms
Which I gaze on so fondly today
Were to change by tomorrow
And fleet in my arms,
Like fairy gifts fading away
Thou would'st still be adored
As this moment thou art...
What's wrong, Andrew?
They're arguing.
Dear great Grandma...
...and dear great Grandpa...
No, No, Larry, you mustn't.
I simply won't let you do it.
For 50 years you've kept me from publishing this.
Because I love you.
I don't want you to be laughed at.
But, at least, I want to read it to my family.
They'll never believe it unless they hear it from me.
I've heard it for 50 long years and I still don't believe it.
Now, come on dear, the children are waiting.
They might think we're arguing!
But I'm not arguing, my love.
This story is true.
It tells what happened to me.
Now Larry.
You just don't believe in miracles.
Don't try to tell it, darling.
Nobody believes in miracles nowadays.
...gloomy winter
Then reigns o'er us no more.
I would not die in Springtime...
...When all is bright around...
...And fair young flowers are peeping...
...From out the silent ground.
When life is on the water...
...And joy upon the shore
For winter, gloomy winter...
Then reigns o'er us no more.
I would not die in Springtime...
What is this?
A newspaper office or a saloon?
A newspaper office Mr Gordon.
- Have a drink Mr Gordon?
- I never drink.
I mean in this office.
But, Mr Gordon.
This is my party.
I'm saying farewell to the dead.
Dead?
- Who died, Stevens?
- 500 people.
500 obituaries that I've written.
Well, no more obit's for me.
Remember the front page is written in the morning.
If you are going to be a reporter, from now on better get to sleep early
I can go to sleep right now Mr Gordon.
Hey look!
I'm going to sleep right now!
Careful, my boy. You're laying right in the middle of 1843.
Well, not a bad place to sleep Pops!
A bed of ancient news!
Well, you just be careful with my files.
Ah, there's nothing as dead as yesterday's news!
Yesterday's news?
You've no imagination, young man.
News is what happens.
What's the difference whether it happens 50 years ago...
...or tomorrow?
You mean, Will happen tomorrow.
No. Time is only an illusion.
Look. March 18, 1875.
To the people then, this was the future; wasn't it?
Well, supposing we were all living on that date in 1875...
...and I arrived with this book.
I can tell you everything that will happen.
Well, give me the one for the year we're living in now Pop... and you can name your own price!
But it's here, my boy.
They're all here.
Look.
19th century
20th century.
I can't quite see the 20th, Pop.
Unfortunately we can't.
But if we could...
Look...
We know what will happen in say...1906.
That's too far away, Pop. I'd like to know what'll happen next year.
No. Just 24 hours from now!
I did the front page with my first story.
That's what I want Pop, tomorrow's newspaper. How much?
No, Larry. No.
Don't ask a thing like that
Oh, come on.
Come on, lets have it Pop, Huh?
I wish I could
Then you'd learn it's no good to know the future
We've all got to die someday..
...but, if we knew the day.
Even if it was 20 years off...
I'd have a corking good time for 20 years.
My boy. Every day of your life would be poisoned.
If I knew where I could get tomorrows newspaper...
...I'd give 10 years of my life for it.
How do you know you've got 10 years?
He's got you there, Larry.
Forget about tomorrow.
Do you want me to tell you what's gonna happen in the next 5 minutes?
Sure.
- We'll all be thirsty.
There's no more beer.
I'm gonna hope that somebody else buys it.
- Wanna come along, Pop?
- No, I haven't time.
- See you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Wait a minute, fellas.
Wait a minute.
If you're interested in the future, look there.
Cigolini.
With a name like that he'll tell your future in Italian.
Yeah, and you won't know what he's talking about.
He won't either.
He's just a faker.
- Yeah, but look at the girl!
- Yeah, she's pretty; that's no fake.
That's a fake too.
They all look good on posters.
What we need is a drink.
Come on.
Inside, you'll find she's fair, fat and forty!
And now, my friend. Tell me, what is the number in the case of your watch.
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- You have a watch, haven't you?
- Oh, for sure.
- May I see it please?
- Well, I had it...
Well, look...
There is your watch now.
It's funny how these trifles get misplaced.
Sylvia. Do you hear me?
I hear you.
Now, listen carefully.
Do you see inside the case of this watch?
I will try.
Tell me, what is the number inside the case of this watch?
Two, Seven, Nine...
Oh, I can't.
You've got to Sylvia.
I compel you.
Three, Three, Five...
...Ninety-four.
Aha!
Is that correct my friend?
Thank you very much.
Thank you Sir. Step right down
- Can we have another chair please?
- Yes, Sir.
Thank you.
I beg your pardon.
My friend, she cannot hear you she only hears the voice of The Cigolini.
She is in a trance.
Then tell her I beg her pardon.
Young man, she is unaware of your presence...
...she can only see the invisible.
Could you make me invisible?
That you can do for yourself.
By sitting down!
Thank you.
And now, my friend, what is your question?
I gave it to you.
Sure, Sure.
Tell me, my friend, is this your handwriting?
That's it alright.
We get this question here every night.
Miss Sylvia has unveiled this part of the future.
I'm very sorry my friend but you lose your bet.
William McKinley is a very worthy man.
Sorry, Sorry...
...but the republican party don't have no chance
The next President of United States will be William Jennings Bryan.
Thank you, my friend.
That is all.
And now ladies and gentlemen, at this time...
Just a minute, there's a señor here who don't seem to agree with me.
Tell me, what are you a republican?
Professor, I have a question.
It concerns a certain young lady.
And you want to know if she's going to have the misfortune to marry you?
Is that it?
All I want to know is whether she'll have lunch with me tomorrow.
Young señor wants to know... if the girl he loves is going to have lunch with him tomorrow.
- Yes, she will.
- Thank you.
But I'd like to know where we'll meet.
My friend, that you have to arrange with the lady yourself.
That I'd like to do, but she can't hear me. She's in a trance.
Just a minute, my good friend...
...Cigolini has put the young lady's mind to sleep...
...and Cigolini is not sure just when she is going to awaken.
And that is why Miss Sylvia will be unable to accept...
...any social engagements.
Hello. Remember me?
No, I'm afraid I don't.
But you answered my question.
I was asleep.
Besides, you were very rude
How do you know I was if you were asleep?
May I take you home?
No, Thank you.
You mean, I can't come inside?
I always go home alone.
105 North Elm Street. Driver.
And take it easy.
Go slow.
No, go fast
I'm in a hurry.
I'm in no hurry.
Take your time.
Now, listen to me
Who hired this cab?
The gentleman did, Miss. He's kept me here waiting for half an hour.
It's a pleasure. You don't mind my riding with you in my own cab,do you?
I certainly do.
- Cabbie.
- I'm sorry, I've hired this cab.
You've hired it, huh?
Well, why don't you get into it?
Alright cabbie, take 'em away.
Twenty-three skidoo!
Thank you, Professor.
And don't try to see her again.
You'd better drive on.
My uncle might see you.
Goodnight.
I can look into the future myself.
You're going to see me again.
Very soon.
You see? My prediction was right.
I told you I'd see you again very soon.
Oh, be careful.
Go away.
Oh no. Not 'til I know whether you're prediction is right or not.
- Prediction?
- Don't you remember?
Señor would like to know...
...if the girl he loves will have lunch with him tomorrow.
You said she will.
I never remember anything
I say when I'm in a trance.
Well, in case you do I'll be waiting for you at the Evening News office tomorrow 'til 1 o'clock.
Goodnight.
Wait...
...the name is Stevens.
Lawrence Stevens.
Just ask for Larry.
Larry!
Larry!
Larry!
Oh, it's you Pop.
You gave me a scare.
Don't tell me you've been drinking alone?
What are you doing here so late?
Didn't I tell you time doesn't exist?
I was waiting for you, Larry.
For me?
I didn't say I was coming back.
I was just on my way home.
So am I
But I wanted to give you this first.
Well, it's the "Evening News"
I've read it.
Maybe not.
You better go home and sleep it off Pop.
I never felt better in my life.
Goodnight, Larry.
Wait and I'll take you home
No thanks, my boy.
We go different ways.
Don't lose it.
Better hurry up, Mr Stevens.
Mrs Keever, today I start a new life.
Starting a little late in the morning.
Well I overslept
I had wonderful dreams
Better take a coat; it's a little chilly today.
Don't you think
Love might keep me warm.
You call this the month of May?
Last night fog, cold this morning.
How goes it, Joe?
Not so good.
Still looking for a job.
Mind if I take a look at your paper?
I haven't got one.
Sure you have one here in your coat.
"Evening News"
That's last night's paper.
I don't mind.
It's the want ads I'm after.
This aint last nights paper.
It's todays.
No, Joe. Todays "Evening News" hasn't gone to press yet...
It must be last nights.
What day is today?
Wednesday
But this says Wednesday
Wednesday?
They must have made a mistake.
What day is today?
Wednesday, all day!
Snow?
It didn't snow yesterday did it?
No.
"Unseasonable snow fall
8 o'clock in the morning"
I didn't see any snow, did you?
How could I? There wasn't any.
Yes, it's Wednesday the whole day.
And what a day!
Snow in May.
"8 o'clock in the morning..."
What time is it?
Can't you see for yourself?
Here's something!
They need a waiter at Beacon & Fifth.
I guess I'll get right over there
Joe!
I tell you we don't need any waiters.
But this paper says...
We don't need any waiters.
Understand?
Then why waste peoples time putting ads in the paper?
You've probably got the wrong address
Here it is. You say you didn't put an ad in the paper for a waiter?
No we did not.
I tell you we don't need any waiters.
Get out of here you butterfingers!
This is the last dishes you break here!
You are fired!
Get your head on Maisie...
...take a dollar from the till and put an ad in the paper right away.
What are you staring at me for?
In the morning paper?
No, I want another man right away.
Put it in the "Evening News".
What do you want?
Nothing.
Nothing.
- Where's Pop Benson?
- I haven't seen him, Larry.
Where's Pop?
Search me, Larry.
- Have you seen Pop?
- No, I haven't Larry.
- Hey, what's your hurry?
- I've got to find Pop.
The old man hasn't shown up yet Larry.
Stevens.
Mr Gordon.
Do you know where Pop Benson is?
Never mind about Pop Benson.
You come into my office.
But I've got to find Pop.
Something's happened
I don't understand.
Something's happened that
I understand very well. You're late.
I know but when I tell you what happened.
Let me tell you what's going to happen...
If you're ever late in this office again...
Mr Gordon. Who's covering the Melba concert at the opera house?
Now don't tell me you want to be a music critic
But suppose something happens there.
A front page story... the biggest news of the day.
In that case, I'll send an experienced reporter. Not you.
But I ought to be there before it happens
You're either crazy or drunk.
Still drunk, I mean.
I'm going to show you something that will change your mind
Your fired!
You can't fire me. I quit.
You quit? You...?
I mean, I will quit tonight if you haven't given me a raise
A raise?
Yes, for the biggest news story of the day
Set up a 4 column headline right now
Bandits steal cash at opera house while Melba sings
At ten minutes past two.
Hey, Did you get fired?
Yes, but I'm gonna get a raise.
Can I help you?
Can we all help you?
I'm looking for Mr Stevens.
Oh, I'll get him for you.
- Larry, she's here
- Who?
Don't kid me. You know who.
How did you do it?
- I forgot.
- Yeah, you forgot.
Miss Smith, this is a day of miracles
I was just passing by Mr Stevens.
I was waiting for you.
Yes, I knew you intended to wait so I ...
...I felt it was my duty to tell you that...
...I can't have lunch with you.
Oh, I see.
You think we haven't known each other long enough.
You're very understanding Mr Stevens.
Well, that's too bad, I...
I could have told you of something wonderful that's happened.
You know why I came...
...tell me your secret.
How would you like to hear the Melba concert?
You're changing the subject.
Oh no I'm not.
That's part of the secret.
Something is going to happen at the opera house.
We haven't much time to get there.
Oh, I couldn't go with you Mr Stevens.
But what's going to happen?
I'll tell you
Two Sir?
What time is it please?
Five past two.
The concert has just started Sir.
We're late.
No, No, we're a few minutes early.
I bet you a pair of tickets I can tell you how much you've taken in
3675 dollars
You lose my friend. 3670 even.
Must be a mistake somewhere.
I guess I'll have to buy that pair.
How much?
- 2.50 each.
Five dollars.
Five dollars.
Well, that makes it right.
3675 dollars
But that isn't all the secret is it?
Oh no, that's just the money that's going to be stolen.
Come inside, you'll be safer.
- Tickets, please.
- We'll stand right here.
- That's not permitted, Sir.
- We're leaving in a few minutes.
Mr Stevens. I don't want to leave in a few minutes.
The show will be over.
You mean Madame Melba?
The big show isn't there, it's here in the lobby.
Listen, Sylvia...
What is going to happen?
There's going to be a hold up.
What kind of a story is that?
3 bandits will come into the lobby
Listen to the music.
I can hear that later.
No, It's going to happen right now.
They'll pretend to ask for tickets...
...then one man will draw a pistol...
It happened.
It happened!
Hurry up driver.
Faster, Faster!
Why did you run away?
To get my story in the first edition
I think you'd better let me out here.
- No, No, No. I need you.
- What for?
The editor will think I'm faking.
I have to have a witness.
But Mr Stevens.
How did you know...?
Do you think you're the only one who can read the future?
Mr Stevens.
What kind of a cock-and-bull story is this?
Mr Gordon. Don't waste time. The papers are going to press any minute
- What time did you say this happened?
- 10 minutes ago, I was there
Are you trying to tell me you wrote all this in 10 minutes?
Don't ask questions. Please, if you have any sense, print my story
You'll pick those up again.
Miss Smith, tell him what you saw.
Well, I didn't see anything.
No, what I mean is,
I was listening to Melba and...
...when Mr Stevens pulled me out it was all over.
What was all over, young lady?
Well, the things he wrote.
I fired you once.
Now, do I have to throw you out?
It will be printed.
You will see it on the front page.
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be alright.
Hello Inspector.
Anything wrong?
Plenty. There's been a hold up at the opera house
Hold the press! Copyist!
- Copyist!
- Yes Sir.
Set this up in paragraphs.
Page one; two columns square
- Shoot it through.
- What's the headline, Chief?
How about "Bandits steal cash at opera house while Melba sings"?
That's it.
By Lawrence Stevens.
- By Lawrence Stevens.
- Yes Sir.
I guess maybe I was a little hasty.
Tell me now, how did you do it?
I'll come back later and talk to you about that raise, chief.
Thank you, Inspector.
You came just in the nick of time.
Stevens. We'd like to know a little more about this.
Sure, sure. But I can't identify the men. I didn't see their faces.
I see. You know everything about the job except who they were.
- That's just about the size of it, yes
- I see.
- Is this the man?
- Yes sir, that's him.
- Now wait a minute, you can't talk to me like that.
- Shut up
Take it easy, Inspector. Stevens is the best reporter I've got..
I wanna find out what he was doing at the opera house during the holdup.
I took this young lady to the Melba concert.
You don't need to be modest, Larry.
Tell him the truth.
You told me this morning what would happen.
Just what I figured.
Oh but please, he didn't do anything wrong
I was there with him.
I'll question you later young woman.
Please wait outside.
Keep your hands off of that young lady...
- She had nothing to do with this...
- Just a minute.
Just how long have you been tied up with this gang?
What gang?
- The four men who pulled this hold-up.
- There were only three.
There were four.
You were the fourth
I said there were only...
Don't pull me like that.
Now look, Stevens, you're not as smart as you think you are
By Lawrence Stevens.
His first day as a reporter and he gets his name on the front page.
He's got a great future when he gets out of jail
- You think they can put him in jail?
- Of course they can.
- But what for?
- For being an accomplice
Don't worry. He won't get more than five or ten years.
With a good lawyer.
Why don't you have dinner with me and we'll talk about it.
Yeah, we'll all talk about it.
Stevens, you're the most stubborn man
I've ever known.
Now, what were names of these three fellas.
I'll put you in jail Stevens for the rest of your natural life.
If you don't tell me the truth
Larry, for heavens sake tell him the truth
- Mr Gordon, where's Pop Benson?
- Stop asking that!
Look, how did you know that this hold-up was going to happen?
Alright, I'll tell you but you won't believe me.
I read it in a newspaper last night
What newspaper?
Todays "Evening News" .
Stop this tomfoolery!
Wait, I'll prove it to you.
Look, here it is.
Isn't that todays newspaper?
Well I'm asking you
Isn't that todays newspaper?
And what is this?
But they were all just printed today.
I got mine last night.
Larry, a joke is a joke but don't carry it too far.
Let's go to headquarters.
Oh please, please!
Please, he's done nothing wrong.
I know he hasn't
You keep out of this, young woman.
Now one last chance.
How did you know the hold-up was going to happen?
- I read it in that..
- Shut up!
- Get him out of here.
- Come on.
Wait, I told him...
...what was going to happen at the opera house.
Take him away!
Take him away!
Sylvia, you can't help me.
Inspector, don't believe a word she says to you
How did you know about this hold-up young woman?
Sometimes I see things that are going to happen.
Can you see what's going to happen now?
Well, you're coming along with us.
Did she show up yet?
No and I can't understand it.
She has never been late.
Too bad. Mr Beckstein here is scouting for Barnum & Bailey
Mr Beckstein.
Gee, what a thrill.
It's been the dream of my life to go on tour with you people.
I'm afraid we aren't interested in mind reading acts.
They come a dime a dozen
- But mine is sensational.
- I can't wait.
Wait Mr Beckstein.
Here she comes now.
- Where have you been?
-Sorry Uncle Oscar, It's not my fault
Listen, Mr Beckstein is here from
Barnum & Bailey's, now come on get on your clothes in there we're on right away
Hurry up!
Don't stall, you hear!
Oh Gee, Mr Beckstein. You know, when I was a young kid this high...
One moment, Cigolini.
- What do you want?
- Just a little information
I'm also interested in your act
You hear that Mr Beckstein?
You've got some competition.
The young lady tells me you can read the future. Is that right?
Future? Past, present and future!
Then you could have predicted what happened today?
Why, sure, sure, anything.
Then your niece was telling the truth when she said you predicted this.
Sure, sure.
Oh, sure, we predicted this
It happens all the time.
Now are you going to stay and see our act Mr Beckstein?
I think I will.
That's great, I know you're going to like it.
You're very busy.
I'll see you after the performance
Thanks. Say, by the way, what were you doing with my niece?
I'm police Inspector Mulrooney.
Police? and if I were you, the next time you make a prediction like this...
...I would inform the police.
You'll find it safer.
Professor Cigolini...
...How about predicting something that will happen now...
...tonight or tomorrow?
Señor, my medium is far sighted...
...things that are too close sometimes are out of focus
Then how did she predict the hold-up that took place today?
You're right my friend, I forgot.
Sometimes she can see things like that
Sometimes?
What about now?
I'm sorry but our time is up
You'll have to ask that question some other time
Will something happen tonight?
A crime?...
...fire, theft, murder or something like that?
Sylvia, I know you are very tired but... do you see anything going to happen tonight?
I can't hear you
I told you she was very tired
She can't even hear me
Speak louder!
Sylvia try, try hard
What do you see?
I see nothing.
That shows it's a moonless night.
How can anybody see anything in the dark
Thank you, Professor
I am not in the dark...
...I see an open and shut case.
Wait a minute, Señor.
Wait...
Now... now I see in the darkness.
It is night.
Yes, tonight.
I see a river...a bridge...
I see a woman walking
Then what happens?
She jumps.
She's in the water.
She goes under.
I don't see her anymore.
All you've got to do is talk, son, and you'll be out of here
Just tell us where we can collar them desperados.
Try and remember.
I tell you I don't know.
I'll be outside if you want to talk to me.
Think it over
It wasn't worth 10 years of your life, was it?
Pop!
Pop, where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you
Oh just around, my boy.
Did I meet you last night or did I dream it?
Tell me, did you give me a newspaper?
It didn't do you any good did it Larry?
Oh Pop, I'm in a jam. Nobody believes me. I can't get out of here
Why don't you say something? What are you looking at me like that for?
I'm kinda surprised to see you here, that's all
I figured you'd be on your way to the river by this time
You ought to be there a little after midnight. You've got to be.
Who says so?
Why, I just read it.
Don't tell me that's the next tomorrow's paper.
Isn't that what you want?
No!
- You want to tell me something?
- No!
Yes!
Maybe... wait.
Pop, does it say anything in the paper about those bandits?
Here it is.
- They've been arrested.
- When were they? Where?
Tomorrow morning in the Union Bank.
The police were waiting for them.
You wrote that!
What about me?
Oh, you'll be a hero
- For telling the police?
- No.
I better read it to you
"Unknown woman makes suicide leap.
Jumps to death from 9th street bridge.
Larry Stevens.
"Evening News" Reporter...
...makes heroic attempt at rescue in river.
Body not yet recovered
- Shortly after midnight..."
- Now I don't believe a word of it.
Why, it says so here
But I'm being held here.
I can't get away.
Even if I could
I wouldn't go to the river
Even if I did I wouldn't jump in
What kind of monkey do you think I am... to risk my life for a woman I don't know... when I do know she can't be saved.
Don't ask me my boy.
I'm no prophet.
- I'm just reading this.
- Enough...
...I never want to hear of that paper again.
You hollering for me?
No, get outta here and leave me alone.
Look, if you let me out I'll tell you where you can get those bandits.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Tomorrow morning at the Union Bank.
All you have to do is wait for them.
Come along, Mister.
Alright, Stevens, Alright
We'll be waiting at the bank.
But if you're fooling us, remember we know where to pick you up
You can go now.
Thanks, Inspector.
Where's Miss Smith?
I owe her an apology.
Miss Smith disappeared after the show Mr Stevens
Her uncle says he don't know where she's gone.
That's right, I don't know.
But he knows.
Listen, this guy's trying to steal my niece. She's infatuated with him.
Say that again please.
Listen you, you whippersnapper
I'll hit you over the head...
Alright, shut up the both of you.
Before you go Stevens I'd like to get to the bottom of this.
At what time did the girl tell you about the hold-up?
- She didn't tell me at all.
- Of course she didn't.
- Now you're lying.
- Listen, I aint lying.
A couple of hours ago you admitted it
I didn't know you was a police Inspector
Oh, I see
You don't understand. I was just putting on an act for Beckstein
That's Barnum & Baileys big man.
Don't you understand?
How could you...
You're an intelligent man?
How could you believe that we could predict anything that we don't know nothing about?
And by the way, who heard the prediction?
Did you hear it?
I didn't
No, but I did hear the prediction tonight?
Ah, that's bunk Inspector.
Bunk!
How could she know anything about a bridge and a river and a woman commiting suicide?
Now, how could she?
Did Sylvia say that?
Shut up. She was just trying to get us out of a tight hole. You too.
Bridge...river?
Did she say the body would never be found?
She didn't say that.
- Now...
- She didn't know.
What is this nonsense?
Don't let that guy get away.
You'd keep him in here if you know your business
If I know my business, you're coming with me.
- Wait.
- Come on.
What happened?
What's the matter?
A woman just jumped in the river!
I saw her!
Save her, Save her!
- Somebody better dive in.
- That's the idea.
- Go ahead, jump.
- I can't swim.
- I can't either.
- Niether can I.
Officer, Officer.
Can you see her?
No, no we can't see anything.
Then there is no use for me diving in.
I better get a boat.
Hurry, Officer. Hurry!
Did she do it?
Now, don't get excited.
We'll save her.
- Oh, I know you won't.
- You know, eh? Are you her husband?
- No, let me go
- Wait.
Just who are you anyway?
Larry Stevens. "Evening News".
What a man!
If I could swim, I'd do it too.
- What was his name?
- Stevens.  "Evening News".
What they won't do to get a story!
Sylvia, Sylvia!
Larry.
What are you doing here?
Now you've spoiled everything.
Sylvia darling,
I knew you were in danger.
I wasn't.
I was just trying to save you.
It looks like we were both trying to save each other.
I had to make a prediction...
...and I had to make it look like it really happened.
Oh you wonderful, foolish little darling.
- Yes, but I didn't know...
- You didn't know what?
That the water would be so cold.
Now I know the newspaper was wrong.
Newspaper?
Oh, never mind. You're here alive.
I found you.
There's the boat.
Look! Her hat floating.
Her hat maybe, but the girl must have gone down like a stone.
Let's go on further.
Yeah, no hurry. It'll be just another case of body not recovered
Did you hear that?
That's what I want them to think.
"Body not recovered"
Gee Whizz! and if I get it that'll be the headline
What if they find me here
Don't worry, they won't
I know they won't
Now you can put me down.
No, No you're dripping wet.
How can I explain a girl's tax in the hallway?
Open the door.
Sylvia?
Alright, you can come in now.
Hey, you're just a little thing aren't you.
I feel perfectly silly
How can I go home like this?
There's nobody on the street this time of night...
...and besides, you look very respectable.
You need a shave.
What's the matter with your tie?
I nearly choked myself trying to tie it the way you do.
Let me do it
Sorry
Look, you take both ends like this, you see? and you put right over left
No, you cross left over right
I'm all mixed up
Oh, it's backwards for me, come over here.
Now, that's better.
Watch closely. You might have to do this for your husband some day
You know, on you this suit looks good
It's the first time I've liked it
I'm sorry, I looked in the closet and couldn't find a girls dress anyplace.
I should hope not.
As a matter of fact, I don't care.
Well I'm glad you're not the jealous type
What would I be jealous of?
Well if you cared at all
I'd have to tell you that...
...I'm a very busy character...
...I haven't got time to be interested in girls.
Last night in the cab you didn't act like a man... who's not interested in girls.
Last night? Great Scott!
What?
Was it only last night we met.
You mean to tell me, all this happened since last night?
Sure, I met the old man on the way home after I left you.
Give me your newspaper
I want to read it.
Oh, he didn't give it to me tonight, he only read it to me.
Well, the old man was outside the window and I...
Oh, what's the use?
Nobody believes us
Larry, you have a wonderful imagination...
You ought to join our act. Maybe you could read a number inside a watch
By the way, how do you do that trick?.
We magicians never reveal our secrets.
Right, Larry?
But I have no secrets,
I'm telling you the truth.
Last night, when the old man gave me the paper I didn't even read it...
...but this morning...
Larry!
Oh Larry, this is awful.
I fell asleep.
Did you?
Why didn't you wake me?
I guess I was dreaming too.
Besides, your shoes aren't dry yet.
I can't wait any longer
I'll have to put them on
Oh, it's shrunk.
What do I do now?
No, No don't get out.
Please go. Don't stay here.
What's the matter?
- My key
- Have you lost it?
I left it in my purse in the dressing room.
What about your window?
Thank goodness I left that unlocked.
- I'll help you.
- No, No please.
Please go, the cab man is watching.
Are you sure you can make it?
Yes, yes goodnight.
You can go now.
Yes, sir.
Goodnight.
What's the trouble Mrs O'Connor?
It's a burglar. I just seen him climb into Miss Sylvia's window
- Did you call Cigolini?
- He's not in his room
Be careful with that thing it might go off
I don't like to handle it.
- Oh, give it to me
- Sure.
A burglar! What are we going to do?
Don't make a sound.
Maybe he'll go away
He'd go a whole lot faster if we all scream for the Police.
You stay right here
I'll go find a policeman.
I'm not afraid.
Poor girl, she must still be asleep.
Maybe he's threatening her.
But there's a light in the window.
Look.
That's one girl I wouldn't have believed it about.
Oh, these theatrical people, they're all...
You folks are up a bit late!
We was waitin' for ya.
Thank you, that's mighty kind of you dear ladies, but...
I was being entertained tonight by an old friend of mine.
Inspector Mulrooney
He wanted my advice.
Tell me, have you seen my niece?
Indeed we have.
I was a bit worried, she was kind of nervous tonight.
Indeed
Yes, she went off by herself.
I guess she went to bed early
Well if she did, she got up again because we saw her at the window
The poor girl is probably worried about me. I'll tell her I'm home.
Sylvia, are you awake dear?
She'll not be answering you Professor and you're cooing like a pigeon
She must be awake if you saw her at the window.
That's not all I seen.
I seen a man.
And he's in there now.
What is it?
What is it uncle Oscar?
What's wrong?
Just some nosey people trying to scandalize your name, that's all
What do you mean saying there is a man in my nieces room?
Just a bunch of scandalmongers, that's what you are!
Making me bust in on an innocent young girl at this time of the night
I saw a man.
I'll prove you're all liars.
Come in here and see for yourself.
Look everywhere. Look in that closet.
Look under that bed.
Get out! Get out all of you!
Now get out yourself!
Come on I see you! Get out from under that bed or I'll pull you out!
He can't run very fast without his shoes.
Hey, which way did he go?
- Who?
The fella' that jumped out that window.
The guy that jumped out that window!?
Smart guy, huh?
Come on
Wait a minute, officer let me explain
You can explain it at the station.
- Have they found Stevens body yet?
- They're still dragging the river
Sweeney, have you finished his obituary?
Yes sir
Refer to him as Lawrence Stevens, not Larry. Give it a little dignity.
- Cut it down it's too long.
- Yes sir.
- Any further details?
- Only that he jumped into the river.
And he just couldn't swim.
That's all.
- He would have made a fine reporter.
- You bet he would.
Oh, a swell guy he was.
Mr Gordon. Mr Gordon.
- Stevens!
- Larry!
- I've a great story, have I got a job?
- Yes.
- Do I get a raise?
- Yes, but what's the story?
The police just trapped those opera house bandits.
- Where?
- The Union Bank. I was there.
Sit down, write it, take all the space you want. Give him this desk
- Kill his obit'.
- Obit'?
- Yes you're supposed to be drowned.
- Yeah a dead hero.
Didn't you try to save a woman in the river last night.
Start writing.
Change these headlines.
Larry Stevens. "Evening News" reporter. makes heroic attempt...
...at rescue in river
- Lawrence Stevens.
- I said Larry.
Now, let him alone, he's got to make the first edition
Now be a pal, Larry.
How come you were at the Union Bank when this happened?
Just passing by
Listen, hero...
How did you happen to cross the 9th
St bridge just as the woman jumped?
Just passing by
Don't tell me you were just passing by the opera house yesterday.
- Yeah, I got a nose for news.
- Come on, how'd you do it?
-You really wanna know? I'll tell you
- Yes.
- Do you believe in miracles?
- No.
Tell the truth Larry.
Who tipped you off?
Anything I want to know
I can find out.
Mr Gordon. Could I have an advance of a hundred dollars?
Yes, Larry. What for?
Well, I've got some plans.
- Not thinking of getting married are you?  - Why not?
Anything he wants to know he can find out...
...but he has to borrow because he found a girl.
If what you say is true... why don't you find her a million for a wedding present.
- A million?
- Sure
By picking all 5 winners at the racetrack tomorrow.
He's got you there.
- Think fast, Larry.
- You got him there, Bob.
Chick, have you seen Pop Benson?
No sir, he hasn't been around for 2 days.
Don't tell me you're still going to hang around for Pop Benson.
It's funny he doesn't show up.
Well, you know the old man...
He's been here a long time.
He's a priviliged character.
He's got a right to get drunk once in a while.
It's not often.
Well, drunk or sober, he's got to be somewhere.
If I were you I'd turn out that light and go home. Goodnight.
Pop!
Pop, wait!
Pop! I've been hunting high and low for you Pop
I said I never wanted to see that newspaper again. I was wrong.
Oh, I'm all mixed up in something
I don't understand... and I'm not going to ask any questions. All I want is...
...one more paper.
Pop, please for the last time.
I won't ask you again
I won't tell anybody how I got it...
...I've just got to know what's going to happen tomorrow.
It won't do you any good, Larry.
Oh but it will. It will make me rich, then I'll have everything I want.
Is it only money you want in this world?
I've got everything else.
I'm in love...
Give it to me Pop and I'll be happy for the rest of my life
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Yes
Thanks for giving it to me Pop.
Remember, I didn't give it to you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...I wish to inform you... that this is the last performance we give at this theatre.
So, we want to thank you very very much...
...for giving us such kind attention.
Thank you so much.
Larry, go away. Keep out of his sight
- I've got to talk to you
- No, my uncle will see you
- I want to talk to him too
No, he found your clothes in my room.
Darling, will you marry me?
- Don't stay here. He'll shoot you.
- Alright, let him but first...
Please, for my sake stay hidden. Stay back there.
Oh, it's you huh?
I've been wanting to talk to you
I'd like to talk to you too Professor.
That's an idea. Won't you step in to my dressing room?
Thank you.
Thank you!
Sylvia, by the way, won't you introduce me to your friend here
Uncle, this is Mr Larry Stevens. of the "Evening News".
Oh, "Evening News"?
A journalist, eh?
Yes, that's right.
Step right in.
Journalism must be a very interesting profession.
You get around quite a bit I suppose.
- That's right, yes.
Professor, I want to ask about your niece
So do I Mr Stevens.
The strange thing that you find in your pockets.
- About your niece...
- Don't be frightened Mr Stevens.
A blank cartridge
You see, everything is illusion in my profession
Unfortunately, life is not an illusion.
In the end we always face reality.
For instance, this is reality.
Oh uncle, please don't play with that gun.
Oh, I'm not playing with it, my dear.
In the mean time, go over there and open those curtains please?
That's a good girl.
Now take down those clothes.
- See hear, Professor...
- Don't interrupt Mr Stevens.
Which clothes, uncle?
My dear I'm sure you know!
I'm awfully sorry
I didn't return these sooner...
...but I was in a place where I couldn't get out.
- I can explain everything.
- So can I
- Do these clothes fit you?
- Certainly they fit me, they're mine
No, uncle, no.
I love her and I'm gonna to marry her.
- ...disgraced before your married.
What did you say?
- I said I'm going to marry her.
- Listen to him change his tune.
I'm not changing my tune at all.
I said I'm going to marry her.
No you didn't.
I said you're going to marry her.
No-one's asked me what I want?
- Nobody's going to ask you
- He's right, nobody is going to ...
No. No. I'm asking you darling
I love you
Say you'll marry me without any waiting. Tomorrow. Say it.
Larry, do I have to say it?
You don't have nothing to say.
I'm doing all the saying around here.
Go on get outta here
Not you Stevens. You stay right here.
There's something I want to ask you.
Do you have any money?
You think you can support a wife?
I think so, yes
What's your prospects?
Wonderful
Tonight I have a hundred dollars
Tomorrow I'll have a hundred thousand
You expect me to believe that?
Your business is to predict the future, isn't it?
Yeah, what of it?
Have you ever predicted five winners at a race track?
Stop asking me those silly questions
So what are you, a gambler?
No, no. A gambler can lose, I can't.
Rubbish
I'll prove it to you
Can you stand the shock?
I've seen about everything
Well you haven't seen this
I can hardly believe it myself
Cut out this hocus-pocus.
What is it?
Oh, you're busy Cigolini
Come in, come in Mr Beckstein.
- I want to see you alone
- By all means
Stay here.
Race results.
Lightning, Ramona...
...Black Flash.
Wonderful!
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, tomorrow.
- I didn't even know you were engaged
- Neither did I til a few minutes ago
It's so wonderful.
Everythings happening at once...
Larry, darling.
Is everything alright?
Yes, everything.
What's the matter Larry?
Aren't you happy?
Oh sure
Has anything happened?
Not yet
Can't we get married?
Oh darling, let's not wait
If we are going to be married we've got to be married tonight
- I've got to get away
- Get away?
- Out of town. Will you come with me?
- But where?
I don't care. Anywhere!
Sylvia look, I just signed a contract for a world tour
If you weren't getting married, what a chance we'd have to travel
We're going to London,
Paris and Europe
She can go. I'll go with you
Professor. Let's all go.
Can we leave right now, tonight??
- Listen, I'm leaving next week
- That's too late
- And without you, Stevens.
- I know, I know
So, your niece is being married?
Didn't you know. to Mr Larry
Stevensof the  "Evening News".
Congratulations my dear Stevens.
I read your articles. The hold-up, the Union Bank. You're a hero.
- Come along Mr Stevens.
- I gotta stay...
I know you're modest. But I want these good people out front...
... to give you a hand.
You've got to take a bow.
Ladies and Gentlemen. I am proud to present to you, a local hero.
The man with the nose for news.
The man who's there when things happen.
The man who'll brave death if it makes news.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr Larry Stevens of the "Evening News".
Well, he's got no broken bones
He can get married, can't he?
He can get married as soon as he wakes up.
Wakes up? It's noon!
Don't tell me he's still asleep?
When you brought him in last night, he was so restless, that they gave him a hypodermic.
Hypodermic or no hypodermic. Go in there and tell him he's got to wake up
He woke up, Doctor.
And he won't speak.
He looks as if I scared him.
How are you feeling this morning,
Mr Stevens?
Am I in the St. George hotel?
Do I look like a hotel clerk?
This is a hospital.
Where am I shot?
In the arm. I gave you a shot to make you sleep.
Did I sleep two days? I hope.
No, just one night. That's all you needed, a good night's sleep.
And all you need now is fresh air.
Oh, I must have had a nightmare
Fresh air will take away that headache.
Get on your feet. Get outdoors
Anything else you wish, Mr Stevens?
Yes, where are my clothes?
I'll get them for you.
- Nurse...
- Yes?
...do you see anything in my coat pockets?
No, Mr Stevens, nothing at all
Only a newspaper
If there is anything else you wish, you can call me.
Ha! Look at the sick man, quietly reading the newspaper
Tell me how do you feel?
Are you alright?
Well, I'm still alive.
You're a lucky boy.
You know, with a fall like that you might have killed yourself
I guess my time hadn't come...
- What time is it?
- A little past noon.
By the way, you know you're getting married today
I'm afraid I can't.
You what?
I can't leave this room.
Not before tomorrow...
...it would be fatal.
Listen, you scallywag, I've just been talking to your Doctor out there... he says you're as strong as a horse.
He says you'll last a hundred years.
He doesn't know anything about it.
Oh, you're faking huh?
Think you didn't fool the Doctor...
...You had no intentions of marrying her, huh?
- You're trying to get out of it?
- No, I want to marry Sylvia.
Tell her I'm on my way
Listen, I should have shot you last night.
Doctor, Nurse?!
I'm going to get married.
But I'll be back...
Keep this room and don't let me out of here again tonight.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
And may God bless your union.
Congratulations, Mr Stevens.
I'm glad to see you so serious.
Marriage is a serious business.
- It's meant to last a lifetime.
- Thank you, Judge.
I wish you all the happiness and health in the world
And may all your troubles be little ones.
That'll be five dollars, please.
Anything else I can do for you?
Yes, you can draw up my Will.
Sorry, you'll have to go to the races. I can't.
Races? On your honeymoon?
People don't go to the races on their honeymoon
- What about your Will?
- My Will?
I want to leave everything to my widow. I mean, my wife.
Eden Gardens, cabby.
No, take him to the racetrack.
Here are the names of the winners.
I aint going to no racetrack
Don't you want Sylvia to be rich?
It's her last chance.
Larry darling, we can go some other day
Some other day won't do.
Eden Gardens.
Alright, we'll go ourselves.
No we aint gonna go.
We're going to the Eden...
Get in darling this is for you. Right driver, hurry up to the racetrack
I want to get there in time to make a bet in the first race
Not if I can help it. Driver dont pay no attention, take us to Eden Gardens
Sorry Miss, there are no ladies permitted inside the betting ring.
- Good, can you keep him out too?
- Wait here, dear.
Oh, I better go and watch him.
A hundered dollars on Lamplighter.
You wouldn't try to kid me would you, Mister?
Lamplighter to win.
Here's the hundred.
Go on, peddle your papers.
Lamplighter just won by two lengths.
Well, did I know the winner or didn't I?
That's just fool luck. I never knew a gambler yet that didn't go broke
But I'm not a gambler.
I tell you, I cant lose
That's the spirit Mister. How about picking a winner for the second race.
- You want me to tell you?
- Sure.
Mud-Lark.
The odds are 20-1
Do you want to lay that hundred?
Sure, take the wad.
Teach him a lesson.
The sooner he goes broke, the sooner he finds out this is a suckers game.
Look at him.
They ought to send you back to the Bull yard...
What a dog.
He wouldn't even make good cat meat.
Mud-Lark.
Mud-Lark. Mud-Lark.
Mud-Lark! Mud-Lark!
He's there... Mud-Lark!
We won, we won!
It don't mean a thing. The other horses were slower that's all
Two thousand dollars and my congratulations, Sir.
If I had you're luck friend,
I'd ride it.
Thats just what I'm going to do. What will you pay on Lightning in the 3rd?
- Straight place or show?
- To win.
It's not for me it's for Sylvia.
Then I'll take the money and go on home
She's my niece aint she.
I've got a right and a duty to protect her future.
I'll take the winnings, please.
The other gentleman made the bet, my friend.
The odds are 5-1 on Lightning.
What do you say?
You're on. Two thousand.
Spoken like a sport.
Give the gentleman a ticket, Chevy.
I can't stand it, I can't stand it!
I won't see it.
Lightning, Lightning!
- Come on Lightning.
- It can't be. Are you sure?
Look for yourself
Come on Lightning!
You mean, you want to bet all this money on Ramona?
Right, to win.
I'll take Ramona too.
I'm afraid that will have to be an even money bet Misterr.
Give me that money. I'll get 4/1 at any place in this tent
You're a good customer.
How about 3/1
3/1, OK
Wait a minute, he's playing us for suckers
This way we can only win 30,000
- If Ramona wins
- Of course, if Ramona wins...
Don't worry, Ramona will win.
What is to be, will be
Look, Larry. Ramona is out ahead.
I know.
Isn't it wonderful darling?
Everything's turning out just the way you expect.
Everything
Ramona, Ramona, Ramona!
Ramona, Ramona, Ramona!
That's a lot of money to bet on one horse Mister.
I can't give you 2/1 on Black Flash.
I could get you 5/1 on Diablo.
Black Flash.
Don't be so pig-headed.
What do you know about horses?
Black Flash.
There you are.
30,000 to win on Black Flash.
For the love of Mike.
Would you put half of it on Diablo?
Black Flash.
I've been in this business a long time but I've never heard of anyone
...picking four sure things in a row.
Not unless he's got things fixed.
I think I'll do a little fixing myself
Diablo is going to win this time if he never runs another race
Black Flash. Black Flash!
Come on, Black Flash!
Black Flash, Black Flash!
Diablo, Diablo!
Diablo, Diablo!
Diablo, Diablo!
Diablo, Diablo!
Get away from me. Get away from me.
You and your tips.
They were wrong. They were wrong!
Black Flash lost.
If I had my gun I'd shoot you.
But I'm not going to get shot.
If the back page was wrong, the front page can be wrong
Sylvia, what a mess you've made out of your life. Look what you married!
Oh, we're happy uncle.
We're always going to be happy.
Does anything else matter?
The judges have the following official announcement to make:
...in the race which has just been run...
...number 7...
...Diablo, has been disqualified.
The winner in the fifth race...
...is Black Flash.
There you are.
Pay me Mister, 60,000 samolians.
And dont give me them in small bills.
I hope you know this is going to clean me out.
Haha, but are you in a suckers game!
Three, four, five...
...Forty-nine, Fifty...
...Fifty-one...
- Driver, stop.
- What's the matter?
- I'm not going back to town.
- But where else can we go?
Anywhere, I...
Well, we could have a nice dinner here in the country someplace?
Larry, will you do something for me?
Something nice?
Lets be gay.
I'd like to have dinner someplace where there's music and people.
I know. The St. George hotel.
No, No. Not tonight darling
Alright Larry. We'll go tomorrow night.
Some other time.
Here you are my dear.
This makes you a rich woman.
Oh no. I'd be afraid to carry that much money
You better keep it; it'll be safer.
No, I might lose it.
- What about me? Please take it
- Somebody's got to take it
Stop, thief!
After him!
After him!
Stop, thief!
After him!
Stop, thief!
Faster driver, he's got $60,000 of my money.
- He's got a gun too.
- A gun?
- Who cares?
- Sure, who cares.
- I care and I'm the driver.
- Faster, Faster!
Get him out of here.
You're wasting my time with your shenanigans
Shenanigans my foot! I tell you we chased the guys all the way into town
Then he arrests us for speeding.
Why didn't you chase the guy who was stealing our money It was over $60000
Go on, who do you think I am?
Ah, it's a fine poilce force!
You let the thief escape and you arrest the victim
Go on, beat it, beat it. Skidoo!
Wait a minute. You can't throw me out of jail. I'm arrested.
Lock me up and don't let me out of here before tomorrow.
Get out of here, both of you.
I'm sick of you.
Inspector, lock me up for just half an hour?
What for?
Well I'm arrested. Put me in jail.
Jail?
Where you belong is the bughouse!
Get 'em outta here!
Inspector, do me a favour will you?
Just lock me up here for 35 minutes ...
- you don't know what it means to me.
- Get out of here!
And stay out!
I wonder why he didn't want us to go in there with him?
Maybe he had some personal business to attend to, uncle.
Yes, the fella must be in there that gives him all the winners.
I hope he finds him.
- Larry, hello Larry.
- Where have you been all day?
Yeah, the boss is tearing his hair
Looking all over town for his number 1 reporter.
Listen, have any of you fellows seen Pop Benson?
Whats the matter?
Where is he?
You mean you haven't heard?
Heard what?
- Why, the old man is dead.
- Dead?
I'm writing his obit.
What caused it?
Just old age, I guess.
- When did you last see him?
- We all saw him Larry. You were here
- When?
- Three nights ago
He died just after we left him.
You remember?
We were all kidding in the library...
Remember when we all laughed when he said...
..."How do you know you've got ten years to live?"
Poor old fella.
Good thing he didn't know he only had time to get home himself.
Oh, don't take it so hard Larry.
When they found the old man they said he had a smile on his face.
Sure, he was always happy.
Remember how he always tried to play jokes on people?
Yes.
Stevens. Come in here.
Look at that clock.
Ten past six.
How long do you expect to hold down your job?
Noty very long, Mr Gordon.

I got a tip something big is going to break. I'll give you the address
No nevermind. I know where it is.
Where?

That's not it.
It's the other side of town.
You mean, you're not sending me to the St. George hotel?
Can't you read?
Mr Gordon, aren't you making a mistake?
Am I in the habit of making mistakes, young man?
Now, you get in a cab and get over there right away
Alright.
But I'm afraid I'm going to wind up at the
St. George hotel at 6:25... no matter where I go
St. George hotel.
I dunno, maybe there is something wrong somewhere.
It's in a different direction
It's in the opposite direction.
Stevens...

- Go to the St. George hotel.
- What for?
You know what for, my boy.

Larry. You're supposed to be dead.
Yes, I know. They say I am.
- What do you think?
- You're alive!
This is terrible.
That's not a public telephone.
Get me the "Evening News", quick!
Inspector.
Inspector, for Pete's sake tell me, what happened?
What am I doing here?
I've already told you.
I'm getting awfully sick of you, Stevens.
Is this yours?
Yes.
The how did it get in the pocket of the man who was killed?
- I get it!
- Answer me!
Inspector, you're a wonderful man.
I love you.
Crazy as a bat!
I'm alive! I'm alive!
It's wonderful.
It's awful.
Our extra with your death story...
...is on the streets.
Extra! "Evening News" reporter shot to death.
Extra! Get your paper!
Extra, Sir?
No thanks, I've got it.
This just came out.
It's alright, I can live without it.
What I'd like to know is, what happened to that money?.
Oh, who cares?
It didn't seem real anyway.
That's right. Came in like a dream and went out like a dream.
That racetrack aint no dream, though?
Listen man, it's a cinch to clean up millions. All you gotta do is pick em
That's all.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight kids.
Are you interested in horse racing?
- I only play sure things..
- You must have a good system.
You said it friend.
Just come around tomorrow and I'll show you how it's done.
It's very simple.
All you do is take the money that you win on the first race...
...and you bet it on the winner of the second race...
...then you take the money that you win on the second race....
...and you bet it on the winner of the third race...
And then -- you dont lose your nerve, see -- you take the whole bundle...
...and you put on the winner in the fourth race...
Cab!
Cab!
- Larry darling, we can't take a cab.
- Why not?
We haven't any money.
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait here until the rain stops.
Poor darling. What a wedding night!
No money, no cab, no umbrella, no shelter, no nothing!
Nothing but a wonderful future.
Don't tell me you can read the future
Let's always take life as it comes.
Larry darling, I only pretended to read the future.
We had to in our act.
But when I'm close to you I ...
...I really feel I can look way ahead.
Years and years.
What do you see? Are we happy?
We'll always be happy as long as we're together.
- Just the two of us
- Just the two of us?
Oh no, I want at least four sons.
Fine, fine.
And I want five daughters.
- It will have to be a big house.
- Bigger than that!
I wonder how we can afford it?
You'll be the owner of the "Evening News".
Well then we can have a whole house full of children.
Big enough for grandchildren too.
And great grandchildren someday.
I can almost see them.
Fifty years from tonight...
...that will be our
Golden anniversary.
- Look darling.
- What?
We can go.
Thanks Pop.
It's good for something anyway.
My name is Anne Blair.
My father was Dr. Julian Blair.
This was my father's house.
In Barsham Harbor,
on nights like this...
...when lightning rips the night apart...
...why do people close the shutters
that face towards my father's house?
And lock their doors and whisper?
Why are they afraid?
No one goes near my father's house.
No one dares.
I don't know where my father is.
I only know that for one
brief terrible moment...
...he tore open the door
to whatever lives beyond the grave.
...he tore open the door
to whatever lives beyond the grave.
Seven years ago, my father was
head of the science department...
...at Midland University...
...a few hundred miles
from Barsham Harbor.
My father was famous.
They were proud of him
at the university.
That night, five great scientists
came to my father's laboratory...
...to see something no one
on earth had ever seen before.
Finally ready to startle us, Dr. Blair? l don't blame you for being skeptical,
Professor Kent...
...but l assure you that all this is vitally necessary...
...for the demonstration l've invited you here to witness.
You will be the first people...
...with the exception of my wife and my assistant, Dr. Sayles...
...to see the proof that the human brain...
...gives off an impulse that can be recorded. l think we'd better close those blinds, Saunders.
Please watch the chart, gentlemen.
Dr. Sayles' brain is sending out the waves you see recorded on that chart.
And whether he speaks or is silent...
...or even if he tried to hide what he was thinking with meaningless words...
...his true thoughts would still be recorded on that chart.
-How did you reach that conclusion?
-Well...
...you will notice a repeated pattern in the variant waves, an exact rhythm...
...as though it were a carrier wave...
...on which the true thoughts were being transmitted. l think we better stop now.
-You feel any ill effects?
-Not at all, Dr. Saunders.
So that's a portrait of the mind of Dr. Sayles.
-Yes, Dr. Hart.
-A poor thing, but mine own.
-Seems incredible.
-Can you make a graph like that...
-...for any living brain?
-Oh, yes.
And each brain has its own wavelength...
...and they're as unlike as fingerprints.
Excuse me. l couldn't help it.
She said it was important.
-Helen!
-Don't blame Karl.
-You're not angry, are you?
-Of course not.
Come on in.
You know everybody here.
-Hello, Richard.
-Hello, Mrs. Blair.
-Good evening.
-How are you? l hope you'll forgive me for interrupting, but l know my husband so well.
When he gets started in the lab...
...he forgets about time and people and everything.
You have forgotten, dear, haven't you?
Anne is coming home this evening.
Anne is our daughter, and she's been visiting friends in New York.
Today's her 20th birthday. l remembered that.
-lf we don't hurry, we'll be late.
-Helen, wait a minute.
We've still got time. l was showing them the recording with Richard.
Now l'd like to show them your graph for comparison.
-But it's so late, darling.
-Oh, please, dear, it won't take a minute. l'm not really Julian's wife. l'm guinea pig number one for his experiments.
And l guess l still like it after all these years. l envy you, doctor.
-A wonderful wife for a scientist.
-For any man.
Thanks.
-Are you sure your hair isn't wet?
-No, no.
-Sure?
-Sure.
You reset the graph, please, Richard.
See how different the wavelengths are?
Why should this record be so much stronger? l don't know, but every demonstration that l've made so far...
...clearly shows the wave impulse of woman, the so-called weaker sex...
...is much stronger and is much more regular than man's.
Evidently, there's a greater natural power in the brain of woman.
-Any woman.
-Haven't l always told you that, Julian?
-Has Mrs. Blair's graph ever varied?
-The individual wavelength never varies.
Well, l believe what l can see.
Now tell me where you go from there.
Well, eventually, conceivably, we may be able to record and read...
...the thoughts of every human brain without a word being spoken.
You actually believe that someday you can push a button here...
...and read what l'm thinking in Chicago?
-You'll be able to read my thoughts too.
-lmpossible.
They called radio impossible, but all this that you see...
...is only the first step towards what we can achieve. lt may take years, perhaps a lifetime.
But if science can unlock the human mind...
...can uncover the secrets of every human brain...
...well, that's a job worth doing,
Professor Kent.
That's the first understatement l've heard you make. l'd like to show them the laboratory notes, Richard.
-l'll get them.
-Richard, get his coat.
-We've got to go.
-That's right. l'll have to leave you with Dr. Sayles.
-You see, l'm helpless.
-Sorry, gentlemen.
Good night.
-Do hurry, Julian.
-l'm sure we've got plenty of time, dear.
Richard, l forgot to turn off those switches. l'll take care of that.
-We'll see you at the house later.
-All right.
Come along, Julian.
Hurry up.
You know...
...l think l even convinced Professor
Kent, and that's a major triumph.
Darling, don't be a scientist anymore tonight.
You're asking an awful lot, but l'll try.
Say, aren't we going the wrong way for the station?
You've forgotten again, haven't you? l told you l was ordering a birthday cake for Anne's party...
-...with her name on it, remember?
-Oh, yes.
-l don't see how you put up with me.
-lt's because you're you. l don't see anywhere to park, do you?
Run out and get the cake, and l'll drive around and pick you up.
And hurry, dear. lt's almost train time.
-Come for the birthday cake?
-Yes, Mr. Booth.
Well, it's all ready for you.
-Okay, doc?
-You're an artist.
Well, l try to be, especially for nice folks.
Bet you and Mrs. Blair are happy to have the young lady back.
-lndeed we are.
-l'll carry it out for you.
-l wanna say hello to Mrs. Blair anyhow.
-Thank you very much.
Helen.
Helen.
I lost my mother that night.
And when she went away...
...I seemed to lose my father too.
He loved her so much.
I did all I could
to take my mother's place.
He didn't seem to know I was there.
He was lost.
Alone.
There wasn't anything
I could say to him.
There wasn't anything I could do. l'll get the car.
No, Richard.
You take Anne home. l want to walk for a while and think.
He went back to his laboratory
that night.
He went back to his laboratory
that night.
Alone.
He couldn't bear being in our house...
...where everything reminded him
of my mother.
Helen.
Helen.
Anne...
...for a moment, l thought that....
Father, what's the matter?
Anne, dear...
...your mother is not dead, not really.
She's come back to me.
No, dear...
...l haven't lost my mind.
She's here, here in this room.
She still lives.
Look. l can only tell you again... l can only tell you again...
...that when l turned on those motors...
...it was simply because l had to be doing something. l wasn't trying to reach my wife. l had no reason on earth to believe that l could reach her.
But she tried to reach me.
There is the proof of something the world has always wanted to believe.
The proof of life after death.
Richard. You of all people, you've worked with me.
You know how we believe that mind could talk to mind.
Well, now l know that there is a way for the dead to talk to the living.
My wife has passed through a change that we call death.
But the impulse that spoke from her living brain...
...that you saw me record on that chart, did not die. lf Helen could send me that message, and she did send it...
...then there must be a way to establish controlled and scientific...
...communication between the living and the so-called dead.
Do you really believe what you say?
Do you think l would invent a story like that about my wife?
How do you propose to go about establishing this communication?
Radio began with a first, faint, transmitted impulse...
...which no one knew how to control or harness.
Yet science found a way to send sound and speech...
...and living images clear around the world.
Well, l believe that the human brain, the brain that invented radio...
...is itself the most perfect sending and receiving mechanism on earth.
And l know that power does not end with the grave.
Don't you see?
We hold in our hand a key that may unlock the door...
...between us and those whom we call dead. lf we can set humanity free from fear...
...if we can show people that those we love are not lost to us...
...if we can wipe out the horror...
...that superstition conjures up out of fear of darkness--
Julian. l have too much respect for you to scoff at your hopes...
...to doubt your utter sincerity.
But what if you do find a way to pierce the veil between us and them?
And let the world of the dead back in upon the living?
We don't know what evil may be lurking behind that veil...
...waiting to get through.
What if you let loose on humanity...
...something much more terrible than any fear that haunts us now?
-But why should that happen?
-l know one thing, Julian.
There are things human being have no right to know.
There speaks fear, even from you.
Call it fear if you want to. l tell you, you must not go on with this.
Must not? ls there a wall beyond which science may not go?
-This is not science.
-Please don't argue.
Anne.
Don't argue with him, because he's not himself.
That's what's in your mind, isn't it?
You won't believe me.
You won't help me.
Poor, frightened little people.
Well, l don't need you. l don't need any of you.
Dad, won't you come home now and rest?
Then tomorrow, maybe you'll feel better.
Tomorrow.
No, Anne. l'm not some helpless child to be taken home for his own good.
Get out. Get out.
All of you.
Do you hear me, Anne?
Go home.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you for your great faith in me.
What do you want? l just wanna tell you you're right, doc. l know.
-What are you talking about?
-l know we can talk to the dead. l talk to my mama all the time.
She died two years ago, but l can still talk to her.
-How?
-Ever hear of Mrs. Blanche Walters?
She's a spirit medium.
Her control brings the voice to you from the beyond. l'm afraid mediums are no good to me, Karl.
You better go now, l've got work to do.
But, doc...
...it wouldn't hurt to see what
Mrs. Walters can do, would it?
No.
No.
That night, my father took another step
toward tragedy.
That night, my father took another step
toward tragedy.
Poor Karl wasn't to blame.
Perhaps no one was to blame.
I don't know.
But that night, my father
met Mrs. Walters...
...and then for him...
...there was no turning back.
There is one here who seeks his mother...
...who asks his mother to speak to him.
His name is C....
K....
Karl.
Karl seeks his mother. ls Karl here?
Here.
Here l am.
Karl.
Your mother is calling you.
Your mother is...
...with us.
Talk to me.
-l see you.
-Karl.
Karl, my son.
-l hear you.
-Karl.
Don't be unhappy. lt's very beautiful here. l am at peace.
There is no pain, no sickness, no sorrow. l am watching over you, Karl.
We will meet again...
...soon.
-Come back!
-No.
No, l can't.
They've gone. l can't find them.
Turn on the lights.
-Mrs. Walters, are you all right?
-l'll get some water. l'm afraid l can go no further tonight.
You will forgive me, now, won't you? l'm so tired.
-lt was wonderful, Mrs. Walters.
-An inspiration.
We'll see you next Tuesday.
Your hats and coats are in the hallway.
-You coming, doc?
-l'm going to talk to Mrs. Walters.
-You coming, doc?
-l'm going to talk to Mrs. Walters. l congratulate you. l've seen a lot of mediums at work...
...but l think yours is one of the smoothest performances l've ever seen.
You're not the first unbeliever l've met.
But other men of science have turned to the occult for surcease from sorrow.
Sir Oliver Lodge was a believer.
-So was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
-l know, Mrs. Walters.
But l am quite sure that l can duplicate every trick you've done here tonight. l hate to disillusion you, Karl...
...but there's your mother's ghost.
And the voice...
...came from...
...here.
There's just one thing more--
Get out of here, both of you.
Get out.
After you've explained one trick that's new to me.
How do you handle the wiring for that table?
What wiring? l experienced a severe shock during the séance, a dangerously high voltage. lt might prove fatal to some of your more elderly clients.
Are you crazy? l've never used electricity in a séance in my life. ls that the truth?
Why should l lie to you now?
What if that's true? lf that impulse...
...is really generated by your own brain...
...and your nervous system without your knowledge, then.... lf that's possible.
Mrs. Walters, l'd like you to come to my laboratory now. l'd like to make a test.
-Why?
-lt may be that you're closer...
...to a real communication with the dead than you ever realized. l'm not in this business for my health, Dr. Blair. lf you can help me in my work, you'll be well-paid. l'll get my coat.
I waited for my father at home
that night.
I waited for my father at home
that night.
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't know where he was.
And all the time, he was locked
up there in his laboratory...
...with Karl and Mrs. Walters.
All he could think of was
how to reach my mother...
...how to talk to her.
He thought Mrs. Walters
might be able to help him.
He wasn't sure,
but he had to find out.
And that...
...that was the beginning. l think you'd better take off that ring.
Stand back, Karl.
Are you afraid?
Now watch those lights.
Your brain and nervous system are producing an electrical current.
An incredibly high voltage.
Dr. Blair, l think it's time you told me what this is all about.
This is science, Mrs. Walters.
There's nothing of the occult about it. lf you can produce an electrical voltage as powerful as that...
...the next step is to see if you can absorb as much or more.
And if l can?
Then you may serve the same purpose...
...as the ground and aerials serve in radio sending and receiving.
But l can't be sure until l make a further test.
Karl, you can help me, if you will.
You can take that off now.
Let's move this out here, Karl.
Far enough. Over here, if you please, Mrs. Walters.
Stand back, Karl.
All ready?
Karl! l'm all right.
Do you realize that 2000 volts would electrocute the ordinary human being...
...but 1 0,000 passed through your body a moment ago without harming you? l believe l'm on the right track.
Let me show you something.
That wave, that impulse was recorded by my wife's brain before she died.
That was recorded after she was dead and buried.
That proves that that brain impulse still lives somewhere.
What has that got to do with me? l believe that if l could change the hookup on that recording machine...
...so that instead of recording your brain waves...
...l could utilize the energy output and receiving field...
...of an abnormally sensitized human being, like you, for instance. l could bring in that impulse so strongly that l could record it constantly...
...and perhaps learn to read its message.
Eventually, l may bring back my wife's actual voice...
...and show the world how to talk to those who have...
...passed beyond the grave. lf you can do what you're trying to do, you'll own the world.
You know that, don't you?
You sit down and rest for a while.
Then we'll see.
My father didn't come home.
I didn't know what to do.
Finally, I couldn't stand waiting,
wondering.
I had to find him.
I called Richard Sayles.
-Karl, do you want to help?
-Sure, doc.
Then get a chair and put it next to Mrs. Walters. Hurry. l'm going to add Karl to the circuit. lt may add to the receiving strength of the machines...
...just like adding radio tubes to a set. ln a little bit, Karl.
That's right.
Now sit down. lt's all right, Karl. lt's not going to hurt you.
Helen.
Helen!
Helen.
Helen.
Karl.
Help me.
-Who is that?
-l don't know.
We'd better not let anybody see him the way he is now.
No. l'll take care of him.
Go see who it is.
Dad, we've come to get you.
Do you know what time it is?
Of course.
Dad, come home. l thought l asked you not to bother me.
Doctor, l don't like to say this to you, but...
...well, people are talking about you.
And there's to be a report given at the university board...
...that...
-...well, that you....
-That l'm losing my mind.
Thank you for telling me.
Now will you leave me alone?
-Dad, please.
-Good night.
Look at Karl.
Karl. Karl. l'm afraid electric shock has injured his nerve centers, perhaps permanently.
The impulse had begun to come through. lt was Helen...
...and now Karl, like this.
The world can get along without him, and nobody has to know about this.
We can't hide him.
He has to have care. lf anyone sees him the way he is, the law will step in and stop you for good. l know.
Have you got enough money to leave this town and take Karl?
-What?
-We've got to get away from here.
Where you can go on working and no one will know.
Yes.
Yes.
The next morning,
my father sent me away to New York.
He resigned at the university.
He arranged to sell our house.
He said he was going away
that same day.
He wouldn't tell me where.
He said he'd write to me later
if he could.
He was like a stranger.
Someone I'd--
I'd never known.
And yet, he hadn't stopped loving me.
I know he hadn't.
Goodbye, Anne.
Goodbye.
I didn't see my father again
for two years.
Every three months,
he sent me a check.
He never wrote me a letter.
I wrote to him,
but he never answered.
He bought a strange house at Barsham
Harbor on the New England coast.
There, he went on with his work.
On and on and on.
People in Barsham Harbor
didn't understand my father.
They began to talk about him.
Slowly, they began to fear him
and then to hate him...
...without really knowing why.
Poison of hate
spread through the village.
No one would even speak to him...
...although he had never
hurt any of them.
You must remember that.
My father never hurt a living person
in Barsham Harbor.
Never.
-Why, Sheriff Ed.
-Evening, Mrs. Marcy.
What on earth you doing way out here?
Come on inside. l asked you what you're doing way out here.
-Oh, business, Mrs. Marcy.
-Sheriff business? ln a way.
Your husband around anywhere?
Seth Marcy ain't set foot on these premises...
...the two years l been working here, and swears he never will.
Seth don't like Dr. Blair.
From what l hear, he's not the only one that don't.
-You better call Dr. Blair.
-l wouldn't dare go near him.
-Why not?
-He's working in his laboratory. l got strict orders never to go near that place.
This is important.
Wouldn't matter if the world was ending tomorrow.
She wouldn't let you bother him.
-She?
-Mrs. Walters.
You seen her? l've heard of her.
Have you noticed anything peculiar going on around here? l make it my business not to notice what ain't my business.
How do you get along with that ape that follows the doc around?
Karl?
He's harmless.
He's like a big, ugly dog.
All you have to do is raise your voice to him, and he minds.
Hey...
...why haven't you got electric lights?
Mrs. Walters says they'd interfere with the reception.
-Reception of what?
-l don't know.
He's inventing some kind of radio, l guess.
You. Stand still.
Ed Willis, you put that gun away.
Karl, you stop.
Karl, you hear me?
Just like l told you.
Karl minds when he's spoken to.
What was that noise?
Some kind of static, l suppose, from the laboratory. l got used to it long ago.
-What do you want?
-l'd like to talk to Dr. Blair.
That's impossible. l don't think so.
Doc, do you want to come down here, or shall l come up?
Maybe l should explain that l'm sheriff of this county.
The name's Willis.
Ed Willis.
-l don't care who you are.
-How about it, doc?
You don't have to talk to him.
Might make things a lot better all around if he did.
Why?
An old settler named Sam Jennings...
...was buried in the family vault day before yesterday.
Well?
His body disappeared last night.
Why tell us about that?
Mostly because it's happened before.
Four times before.
Five bodies missing in the two years since you people came to this town.
And it never happened before you came to town.
Now, it's my job to find out who stole those bodies.
We don't know anything about it.
Ordinarily, l don't pay attention to what people say. l figure they've gotta talk about something.
But when a whole town begins to talk about...
...a connection between the missing bodies...
...and whatever it is that goes on in this house...
...well, l figure it's time l found out what is going on.
This is not the first time l've been the victim of people who talk...
...about things they're too ignorant to understand. l'm engaged in experimental work.
All right.
What kind of experiments?
That's none of your business. l think it is, under the circumstances.
Dr. Blair...
...l want you to take me to your laboratory.
Show me just what it is you are doing...
...tell me what it's all about.
Then l can go back to town and tell the folks.
Tell them you're okay.
And l'll make them quit talking before the talk goes too far.
Now, that's fair enough, isn't it? lt'd be impossible to explain to you what l'm doing, even if l wanted to. l believe l have the right to go on with my work without being put on trial by fools.
This is my house. l've committed no crime. Karl.
You will take this gentleman to the gate and see that he leaves. That's all.
Good night.
That's all for tonight.
-Good night, Dr. Blair.
-Good night, Mrs. Marcy.
That man will be back. l'll take care of him when he comes.
You'd better get some rest.
No, l think l'm going to work a little later tonight.
Good night.
Oh, it's you, Sheriff Ed.
-You scared me out of me year's growth.
-Sorry. l didn't turn on the headlights, in case anybody was watching. Come on.
Come on, get in. l'll drive you home.
You certainly caused plenty of excitement tonight.
How on earth could you practically accuse poor Dr. Blair...
...of stealing bodies?
Well, somebody stole them.
What's in that laboratory of his? l never been in it.
The door's always kept locked.
-Could you get in?
-And get caught and lose my job? l never was inquisitive, and l see no reason to be now...
...just to satisfy your curiosity.
Look, Mrs. Marcy. l'm not saying there's anything really wrong in that house.
But a lot of folks are thinking there is unless l can tell them differently.
You know, folks can talk just so long, and then there's an explosion.
And a lot of people get hurt. l don't want any mob trouble in our town.
Maybe you could help to keep that from happening.
Will you try? l never made a promise yet and didn't keep it.
So l ain't gonna promise you a thing...
...but l'll see.
Karl...
...l forgot to lock the laboratory.
Take care of it for me, will you?
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out!
Dr. Blair. Dr. Blair!
Dr. Blair! Dr. Blair! Dr. Blair!
Who's in there?
Where are the keys?
Stand back. ls she dead?
Yes.
-How'd she get in here?
-l forgot to lock the door.
Now l am a criminal, a murderer.
When she doesn't come home tonight, her husband will start looking for her.
-Then how? What?
-There's only one thing we can do.
They're here.
-Who?
-Seth Marcy and the sheriff.
You'll have to talk to them.
They won't leave unless you do. l've taken care of the footprints.
You'd better not keep the sheriff waiting too long, or he might come up here.
-Where's my wife?
-Easy, Seth.
-l can't tell you anything about her.
-She left here hours ago.
You're lying.
She's here in this house somewhere. l'd like to help you, but l can't.
How do l know she's not here?
What would she be doing here at this time of night?
You have time to help them look for her, haven't you, Dr. Blair?
Yes, l'll get my hat and coat.
Look where?
She always went home the same way, didn't she?
The path leads right along the edge of the cliff at one place. l know it does.
Come on, Seth. lt was dark when Mrs. Marcy left the house.
We asked her if she wanted a lantern, but she said she didn't need one.
She walked that path day or night, rain or shine, for two years.
She wouldn't have walked over here.
What did you do to her? l didn't do anything to her. l'm....
-l'm terribly sorry.
-Seth.
May l go home, please?
Yes, you might as well. l'd be glad to help to pay for the funeral expenses...
...in case you find--
Good night.
They've killed her.
Seth!
Now, l know how you feel...
...but l can't stand for you starting any trouble.
You've got absolutely nothing to go on...
...nothing but loose talk and superstition...
...and the fact that you never did like Dr. Blair.
Now, you go around talking too much and....
Well, l might just have to put a stop to it.
Go on home now, Seth.
Well, are they satisfied?
Why did you follow us?
We could honestly have said her death was accidental.
Now we've lied.
-We're as guilty as if we'd planned this.
-Stop talking like that.
Come on.
We can't stay here now.
Richard and I reached Barsham Harbor
very late that night.
The sheriff told us what he thought
had happened to Mrs. Marcy...
...and hinted much more than he said.
He told us Seth Marcy was telling
everyone my father had killed his wife.
The sheriff told us so much
we could hardly believe him.
My father had become
a very strange man.
While we were on our way
to his house...
...he was working
in that ghastly place.
Karl, go over to the other wall and fix your safety belt.
Stand back, please.
The sooner you take charge in there, the better.
Helen.
Look out, let me.
-You better stay down here, Anne.
-No.
Let me out. No. l can't stand it.
Julian.
Helen.
Stop. l can't stand it.
Julian.
Helen.
No, let me out.
Mrs. Walters.
Mrs. Walters.
Karl, don't open that door.
Anne.
Oh, Dad. l sent for her.
Told her she'd better come here and take care of you.
Dad, why didn't you answer my letters?
-Well, you never wrote me.
-But l did. l saw a letter at the post office myself.
That's how l knew where to get in touch with her.
But Mrs. Walters always-- l should have realized long ago.
You've done me a favor, a great favor.
There'll be no more trouble in this house...
-...now that my daughter is here.
-l'll be in touch later, sheriff.
All right.
Good night.
You'll find a lamp downstairs in the kitchen.
You'll be wanting something to eat, won't you? l'll come talk to you later.
-But, doctor, why--?
-l'll be down in a few minutes, Richard. l've got something to do. lt won't take me very long.
All right, Dad.
You'll have to help me, Karl.
Yes, she's dead. l thought you'd never get here.
Seth's got them worked up to where they're talking about lynching him.
Not tonight, Seth.
Now go back home where you belong.
-You ain't stopping us, Ed.
-l will. lf l have to use this.
-Now, l'm warning you.
-Attaboy, Joe.
Hold him. Come on, men.
-You can't stop them now.
-Come on.
No, Karl.
Come in, Richard.
Come in, Richard.
Doctor, are these...?
Now you know why l couldn't bring the sheriff in here. l never meant to kill anybody, Richard.
And as soon as the work is finished, l'm going to give myself up.
Richard, we must go on with the work. We are both scientists.
You and Anne can help me.
Do you think l'd let Anne have anything to do with this?
Helen spoke to me tonight. l actually heard her voice. l found out something l should've known...
...something l should've realized a long time ago.
Every time Helen's tried to speak to me since she died...
...Anne has been somewhere near.
-What are you trying to tell me?
-Anne is the key.
Don't you understand, Richard?
The impulse that belongs to Anne is almost identical with her mother's.
Their minds are in tune.
Tonight...
...for the first time, l heard Helen's voice.
And now with Anne to help me, perhaps l can talk to her.
Do you think l'd let you put Anne in that?
Richard, she'll be perfectly safe.
-l won't let you touch her.
-Oh, Richard.
Don't try to stop me now.
Trust me. Help me.
Richard. l'm going to take Anne out of this place.
Maybe l can keep her from knowing about this.
Richard, Anne cannot leave.
Anne cannot leave.
Karl! Don't touch him.
He isn't badly hurt.
You better take him to my room.
And that's all!
Anne, dear, l'm not going to hurt you. ln a few moments, we may hear your mother's voice.
We're very close to your mother now, dear. l feel sure of it. l've got to use more amplification than l've ever used before, but don't be afraid.
You'll feel something pulling at you, dragging you towards the table...
...but l won't let that force hurt you. lf there's any danger, you can trust me to turn it off.
Julian.
Julian.
Helen!
Julian.
Julian.
Julian.
Helen.
Helen!
He's upstairs in his laboratory.
Get out of the way, you.
-Come on, boys!
-Get him!
Helen.
Anne!
Anne. Anne!
Anne, are you hurt?
Anne!
They say my father's spirit
must still live in that house.
I don't know.
When he seemed to be so close
to what he sought...
...something reached out for him.
A warning that human beings
must not try to reach beyond death.
I don't know.
No one will ever know.
And yet, perhaps the time will come
when the door to infinity will open.
Perhaps.
Perhaps.
Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.
For thy kingdom come, thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever.
Amen.
I'd like you to have my notes and records.
Of all the newspapers, yours was the only one which was fair to me.
Thanks, Doctor.
Friday the 13th.
This morning my old friend,
George Kingsley,
was conducting his class
at the University of Newcastle...
And in 1547
Sir Joshua Peachtree wrote:
"Thou who breakest glass will find
"Fate can be, oh, most unkind
"Under ladder walkest thee, most unlucky thou wilt be
"Each dread Friday do take care
Else thou fallest down the stair. "
And with that little epic,
Sir Joshua proved that he was a poet of the first rank.
In fact, I should say, he possibly was the rankest poet that England ever turned out.
Just a moment, please.
Just a moment.
This being the end of the semester,
I have an announcement to make that I'm sure will give you a great deal of pleasure, although I myself am sorry to tell you that I may not be with you next term.
Today I must leave to appear before the inquisitional board of regents of a very large university in the east.
Very large university indeed.
How many the dunces that has been sent to Rome, excels the dunce that must stay at home.
I sincerely hope the board does not like me.
I'll try and be back next term.
Oh, my umbrella.
Dr. Kingsley.
Yes, dear.
I wish you the best of luck, but...
Thank you.
We hope to see you next semester, Doctor.
Hurry, Professor. Dad will be waiting to take us to the station.
Have a good trip, Professor.
Hurry back.
Thank you very much.
Professor.
Yes, John.
English won't seem the same without you.
Well, that's very nice of you.
Come on, Professor.
You know, Jean,
I'm going to miss all this.
But most of all,
I'm going to miss your father.
A brilliant man, Jean.
It distresses me to think that such a great brain surgeon should be so utterly wasted in Newcastle.
Newcastle is a very welcome port in a very bad storm.
Why, if it hadn't been for you, Professor,
I don't know what we'd have done.
Well, Margaret, you don't know how sorry I am to see you and George leave.
You've befriended Jean and me in so many ways since we came to live here.
We're going to miss you too, Ern.
Thank you.
Here they are.
Hello, darling.
Hello, Margaret.
If I could only drive, I'd never impose on you like this.
It's a pleasure, George.
Rather a mixed one, you know.
We hate to see you go.
Hello, Dad.
Oh, I knew
I'd forgotten something.
As usual. What now?
Ernest, would you mind stopping at the student's cleaning shop?
My one and only hat is there.
And a professor must have dignity when he goes to the city.
Here we are, George.
Dr. George, we're here.
George, hurry or we'll miss the train.
Professor, don't let them sell you one of those fancy feathers.
I won't, Jean, I won't.
And George.
George. George?
Yes, dear.
Now watch the traffic.
Be careful.
Yes, darling. Don't worry.
Careful now, please.
Mr. Red Cannon now belongs to the history of crime.
Past tense.
What about our dough?
We ain't got it yet.
Yeah. How about it?
Mr. Devore, it would have been poor business to kill Red, unless I knew how to locate the money.
Turn back to the city.
Ernest.
He's going to be all right, my dear.
Now, you go home with Jean and I'll call you later.
We'll be waiting, Dad.
Come, Margaret.
Ambulance, huh?
Uh-huh.
Some men were shooting at you. Who were they?
Just a few of my pals.
How bad am I hurt?
Few minor cuts on the scalp.
That's all.
Any pain?
No, not much.
Who's the other customer?
The man you ran down.
He's dying.
Softy, huh?
Did those guys get away?
Yes.
Then pull the bell cord of this bus. This is where I get off.
I'm goin' rat-killin'.
Hey, I'm tied down.
What is this? A pinch?
Turn that thing off.
I can't stand it.
It's driving me crazy!
It's no use, Sovac.
Kingsley has compound frontal and parietal fracture and severe concussion of the cerebrum.
Just a matter of hours, or minutes.
Pulse 65. He's in a coma.
All right, Nurse.
You can go. I'll stay.
What's the matter with me,
Doc?
Thanks.
What's the matter with me,
Doc?
I can't feel anything.
My legs are there, but I can't feel 'em.
Your spine is broken.
You're paralyzed.
Well, pull me through,
Doc, will you?
Pull me through and I'll pay you anything.
The only possible way
to save George Kingsley's life
is by a brain transplantation,
an operation I performed successfully on animals.
This is a dangerous and illegal operation,
but a chance to make a great scientific discovery,
and perhaps save my friend's life.
Ern, how long will his head be bandaged?
Oh, not long now.
Dr. Sovac.
Yes?
Two gentlemen want to see you.
Who are they?
They are detectives,
I believe.
I'll see them.
Excuse me, please.
I'll be right back, George.
A miraculous recovery,
Mrs. Kingsley.
Amazing.
It's Cannon, all right.
Well, Doctor, the head injuries cause death?
And many complications.
His spine was broken.
We did all we could for him.
Don't feel badly about it,
Doctor. He wasn't worth it.
He had nothing but the electric chair to live for.
Did he say anything before he died?
About money, for instance?
Not that I know of.
Thanks, Doctor.
$500,000.
With that money I could build my own laboratory
and continue with my experiments.
Kingsley is convalescing
and seems to show some of Red Cannon's traits.
Does the Cannon brain in Kingsley's head
retain the knowledge of the hidden money?
I've been waiting to see you, Ernest.
I'm worried about George.
He just doesn't seem himself.
Why, he's getting stronger every day, isn't he?
Physically, yes.
But his mental condition doesn't seem right.
He's irritable.
Flies into a rage for no reason at all.
That isn't like George.
No, it isn't.
He has been acting strangely, lately.
I don't think I'd be too alarmed about it though, if I were you.
Well, I hope you're right.
I think so.
You're late today, Ernest.
Come and sit down and talk to me.
I'm feeling very low.
Will you have some tea?
No, thanks.
The trouble with you is, you're feeling too well.
Too well?
I used to think that a long period of convalescence would be like an ocean voyage.
That I'd have a chance to read all the books I want to, that I haven't time to, ordinarily.
But nothing seems to interest me.
A boring period, convalescence.
Yes, indeed it is.
I'm afraid I've got to go to
New York for a few days, George.
You've got to...
Yes, a little business for the hospital.
Well, that's nice, I must say.
What am I going to do for companionship?
Well, why not come with me?
Come with you?
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
New York's too big, too noisy.
I never have wanted to go there. And yet...
The very thing you need, George.
You've had your fill of peace and quiet.
You'll find New York exciting, stimulating.
Just the thing to lift you out of the doldrums.
As my doctor, do you prescribe it?
As your doctor,
I insist on it.
Very well.
I'll tell Margaret to pack.
Oh, no, George.
Let's go alone.
Alone?
In New York, without Margaret?
What you need is a radical change.
Well, perhaps you're right,
Ernest.
I've been like a bear, lately.
I'm quite sure she'd be glad to be rid of me for a time.
New York.
New York. I wonder...
I am taking Kingsley to Red's old environment.
In fact, to the Midtown Hotel
which Cannon used as his hideout.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Uh, we'd like adjoining rooms.
Uh, yes, yes.
Uh, 505 and 506, if they're available. Are they?
Well, yes, they're available.
Thank you.
Uh, you've been with us before, sir?
Why?
No, of course not.
But I... I like a corner room with three windows and a fire escapes.
This way, gentlemen.
Well? Well?
Uh, I'm... I'm in the next room, Ernest.
Uh, will you bring the black bag in here, please?
You sure picked a room with a history, Mr. Kingsley.
Oh, really?
But you see, history is not my subject.
I don't mean that.
I'm talkin' about Red Cannon.
He hid out in these rooms for nearly six months, from cops, G-men and his own gang.
Nobody in the hotel suspected him.
But his gang got wise and Red tried to run out.
They caught up to him in some small town in the sticks.
Imagine when we found out who he was.
And him with nearly a million bucks hidden away.
Say, the manager locked himself in here and took these rooms apart.
Yes, yes.
But he's still the manager, so I guess he didn't find it.
Anyway, I made plenty out of Cannon.
I was the only one he allowed up here.
I had a special way of knockin'.
Yes, sir. That's it.
Thanks.
A talkative youngster.
Babbles on like Tennyson's brook.
Ernest, I'm going to freshen up a bit.
And then let's go out.
Let's, uh, do the town.
You know what I mean.
A good dinner, and perhaps a bottle of wine.
Splendid, George.
I'll get changed and then we'll go.
"I chatter, chatter as I flow
"To join the brimming river
"For men may come and men may go
But I go on forever. "
The Cannon brain remembers this hotel.
Will it also remember
Red's friends?
Miller, Kane,
Devore and Marnay.
I'm taking Kingsley to the Club Royale
where he'll see Sunny Rogers,
Cannon's former sweetheart.
An old fashioned.
George?
I'm ready for anything.
Two.
Yes, sir.
I find the singer rather interesting, don't you, George?
Yeah. Who is she, Ernest?
I seem to know her.
Could she be one of my former students?
I really am surprised,
George, at your pretending to know the singer.
Well, come, come, come now, Ernest.
I'm a college professor, not a college boy.
All these people here on pleasure bent.
"And pleasure brings as surely in her train
Remorse and sorrow and vindictive pain" as William Kelper says.
Oh, pardon me.
Sure.
Why, what's wrong, George?
My head hurts.
That pain again.
I can't stand it.
We'll leave instantly.
Yes. Yes, the next train leaves at noon.
You wish me to make a reservation?
Yes, please.
And send up a boy to help me pack, will you?
Well, good morning, George.
You slept late.
But my sleep doesn't seem to refresh me.
Ernst, we're old enough friends that we don't have to deceive each other.
Why do you say that?
Then tell me, what is the matter with me?
My sleep only seems to tire me.
And I am haunted by the most horrible dreams.
A perfectly normal reaction to the shock of your accident, George.
Come in.
What do you mean by that ridiculous tap, tap, tap-tap-tapping?
Why don't you knock the door like anybody else?
Anything you say, sir.
You wanted me to pack?
Yes.
I don't know what I'm doing here, anyway.
Ernest, I'm going home.
I need Margaret.
I don't think I'd try to leave today, George.
Now, you can stop the packing.
Yes, sir.
I don't think you're well enough to travel.
Now, let's wait and see how you feel tomorrow.
Red. Red Cannon.
You were the leader of a gang.
They tried to kill you.
You came back to get revenge.
Red.
Do you remember the name,
Marnay?
Marnay.
He's the one who took your place.
Marnay, Miller, Kane, Devore.
Why did they try to kill you, Red?
Uh, to get your money?
But they didn't find it, did they?
It's safe just where you hid it.
Where is it, Red?
Marnay.
Miller.
Kane.
Devore.
You've been ill, Red.
I remember that... that hick town.
You're the doc, ain't you?
Yes.
Say, my back's better.
You cured me?
Yes.
You're perfectly well now.
Thanks, Doc.
I won't forget it either.
Midtown Hotel, huh?
How did I get here?
You asked me to bring you.
I must have been out of my head.
Every copper in town will be lookin' for me.
I've got something to tell you, Red.
Oh, yeah? What?
You were smashed up in an accident, you remember?
I had to operate to give you another body.
You had to do what?
What are you talking about?
Why did you do this to me?
It was the only way to keep you alive.
Oh.
Why, Doc, you're a genius, but you could have given me a better chassis.
I never saw plastic surgery like that before.
I used the body of the other man, who was dead.
It was the only way to save you.
Hey, wait a minute.
Nobody will know me like this.
Why, I can do anything.
Who was the other guy?
He was a professor of English Literature.
English Literature?
Well, how are you, Prof?
You're now
Prof. George Kingsley, and you teach in the university at Newcastle.
What a disguise.
What a break for Red Cannon.
Come in.
Telegram, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, what is...
Next time, you do as you're told.
When you come to my room, knock like this.
Now scram.
Yes, sir.
Next time.
Red, I think...
Good morning, sir.
I'll take them.
And, uh, here's the morning paper, sir.
Compliments of the house.
Thank you.
You sure get around, mister.
From the looks of those clothes, seems like you fell into a cement mixer.
That will be all.
Yes, sir.
Morning?
Yes.
How do you feel?
Not very well.
I'm afraid coming to New York was too exciting. I...
I feel as if... as if the life were drained out of me.
You will be all right as soon as you've had a little rest.
Well, perhaps so.
Here's a curious thing,
George.
It seems that Louis Devore, one of the Red Cannon gang, was found early this morning in a deserted building dying from the effects of a brutal beating.
His back had been broken.
Good heavens, Ernest.
Why on earth bother me with that gruesome stuff?
Sorry, George.
Things have taken a dangerous turn.
Kingsley has killed Devore.
While in this environment
I never know
when the murderous brain of Red Cannon
may take possession of Kingsley.
But I will not stop my experiments.
I must find out where the
Cannon money is hidden.
All ready, George?
Oh, miss.
Yes, sir?
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to open my friend's door for me.
I'm a little worried about him.
He hasn't been very well.
Yes, sir.
I ain't been feeling so well myself, lately.
Evidently, my friend has gone out.
Well, you can wait for me.
Your hat, sir?
No, thank you.
I was here the other night with a friend.
The rather middle-aged gentleman?
That's right.
Has he been here tonight?
I don't think so.
Well, wait a minute, there was a gentleman that looked like him at the bar.
At the bar?
Oh, no, no.
Uh, on second thought, it couldn't have been your friend.
And besides, that man left a little while ago, sir.
I don't think Sunny was pleased to see us.
Why are we wastin' time foolin' around here?
Didn't you see that newspaper picture of Devore's battered body?
So maybe that killer's after us too.
A good deduction.
But who would want us dead except some friend of Red's?
And who would know about Red Cannon's friends better than Sunny?
That's right.
Tell your nerves to stop doin' nip-ups.
Marnay will handle this.
You will handle this, Kane.
I've seen you trying to take Red's place here.
Go on.
I didn't have any part in Devore's killing.
Nobody said you did.
Then everything is just lovely.
I'd like to see you at your apartment after you're through.
Maybe if we put together what you know about Red and what I know, it will add up to some money.
Say, if I knew anything about a half a million bucks, do you think
I'd be working in this joint?
We'll go over all that later.
Like it?
Sure.
It's yours tonight.
Hey, what is this?
Get out of my car.
What do you want?
You ought not to have to think very hard after what happened to Devore.
Who are you?
Hello, Bill.
Who is it?
"Who is it" sent you that money
to get out of that trouble in Chicago.
Red?
You're alive?
Well... Yes.
I'll be right up.
Red.
Well, of all the...
Don't speak.
Don't even move.
Just let me look at you.
It's great to be back, Sunny.
Why did you move the piano?
You know I always liked it in that corner.
How do you know about that?
Surely you didn't think I'd forget in two short months?
Are there any cigarettes in the drawer?
Yes.
You look good, darling.
Come on, let's have a drink.
Nothing touched, eh?
Good girl.
Well, here we are.
How do you like the trimmings?
Let me put it on.
How did you get it?
Just picked it up.
Well, you don't seem very glad to see me.
You're afraid.
What are you afraid of?
Well, I'm not afraid.
Red Cannon must be jumping with joy in his grave the way his boys are getting knocked off.
All right, boys.
Now about the Devore and Kane murders, you know, they were both Cannon's men.
We've always believed his own gang was responsible for Red's death.
Can some friend of his be systematically killing off his murderers?
A dead gangster has no friends.
I want you to go out and find Marnay and Miller.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Take a couple of men with you and check the Ritz Manor apartments.
You're sure this is
Marnay's apartment?
Well, good afternoon.
I'm sorry, but Mr. Marnay is not at home.
Do you mind if we wait for him?
Not at all.
Are you a friend of Mr. Marnay?
In a way. I'm just waiting till he comes back.
Who are you?
What?
We're from police headquarters.
Oh, I see.
My name is Kingsley.
I'm a professor of English at the University of Newcastle.
From Newcastle?
Yes.
You're the professor who was hit the time Red Cannon was killed?
That's right.
What business could you have with Marnay?
You better come along with us and explain that to the DA.
Good morning, Sunny.
Marnay.
What's the matter?
Aren't we welcome?
So Kane was here last night.
Well, I, uh, had a date with him, but he didn't show up.
The police found his body this morning, strangled.
Yeah, and his back was broken, just like Devore's.
I don't know anything about it.
No? If Kane wasn't here where did you get that watch?
Well, I expected him, but somebody else came and gave me the watch.
Who?
He said he was Red Cannon.
What did he drive up in, a hearse?
Try again, and be a little more believable.
Red was here. Look.
Red always killed his cigarettes this way.
Now you've got to be alive to do that.
Red's been dead since two months.
That's what I thought.
But last night this man came here.
He didn't look like Red, but...
This is the first thing he did when he came in.
He knew everything that only Red knew.
He even acted and talked like Red.
Probably somebody
Red coached carefully.
Somebody from that hick town who got close to him before he died.
If he knows so much, he may know where Red hid the money.
That would be his payoff.
He gets Red's money for killing all of us.
Where does he live?
I suppose you are going to say
"Room 505 at the Midtown"...
Who left these matches here?
Ask Devore and Kane.
Thank you.
Um, any word of Prof. Kingsley?
Nothing, Doctor.
Hmm.
Dad.
Margaret was so worried, we talked it over and decided to come on to New York.
Ernest, I just have to see George. Where is he?
Well, he's out.
I... I don't quite know where.
But I... I thought you were always with him.
I'm afraid, you're not going to like this, Margaret, but I'm going to be quite blunt with you.
When George was convalescing at home, you were a marvellous nurse.
I did what I could.
Exactly.
When he turned his head, you adjusted the pillow.
If he reached for a glass of water, you were pouring it for him.
I'm sorry
I couldn't do more.
But that's just the trouble.
If you had kept it up, he would have been a permanent invalid.
Well, why didn't you tell me?
Naturally, I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
And fortunately, George himself rebelled in time.
That's why you brought him to New York alone with you.
Of course, my dear.
He had to have a change.
Has it helped? Is he better?
Yes, he is but we must still be careful.
Now, I suggest that you allow him to remain here till he's perfectly ready to go home of his own accord.
And don't try to see him.
Oh, but I...
You and Jean go up to your rooms and get some rest, and take the first train out to
Newcastle in the morning, huh?
Well, if it's best for him, all right.
Believe me, it is.
Well, there's George.
Margaret, you said you wouldn't try to see him.
Will you take her to her room, Jean?
But, Dad...
Jean, I assure you what I'm doing is for his own good.
Now please believe me.
Who were the women?
Never mind that.
What's happened to your shoulder?
I got nicked.
Who were those women?
My daughter and your wife.
My... My what?
Oh, Kingsley's, huh?
Well, get them out of here.
I don't want any dames around here.
Let me see.
You've been shot.
Yeah. Fix it up, will you.
How'd you get it?
The coppers shot me.
It's a scratch.
How'd you get it?
Don't ride me.
It's your fault, anyway.
Mine?
Yeah. You told me to use this
Kingsley gag. I did, and didn't work.
Where were you?
In Marnay's apartment.
They tried to question Prof.
Kingsley and I wouldn't stand for it.
You killed them?
What do you think?
Get to work.
You fool.
They'll catch you before we get the money and...
What money?
What do you know about the money?
You know too much, Doc.
Just a minute, Red.
If you kill me, what becomes of you?
You think you're
Red Cannon, don't you?
But whose body are you wearing?
Well, you told me...
Exactly. George Kingsley's.
Professor of English literature at Newcastle.
How'd you like to be Kingsley for good?
What do you mean?
You're walking around in Kingsley's body, all right.
But part of your brain is his and you can't control it.
That's not true.
You killed Devore.
Last night you murdered Kane in his car outside the club.
I saw it, remember?
But do you remember how you woke up?
In this very room, you woke as Kingsley.
Complaining of nightmares, not knowing why you were here.
I can't think.
What's happened to my brain?
I can't remember.
Of course you can't.
If I hadn't forced you back into Red Cannon, you'd have gone to Newcastle as Kingsley for life.
Stop it.
I can make you forget you ever were Red Cannon.
Stop it, I tell you!
I'll cut you in on the dough.
You'll get your share.
From now on, you do exactly as I say.
Okay, Doc.
Now, I'll fix that shoulder.
It's no use, Jean. I'm not going home in the morning, not unless
George goes with me.
But you told Dad...
I don't care what I said.
When George came in, your father practically ran me out.
He's trying to conceal something.
No, Margaret.
I'm going to see George now, and if Ernest tries to stop me, I'll call a New York doctor.
Margaret, I'm sure you're worrying over nothing.
But I'll go talk to Dad.
There you are.
Okay, nice job, Doc.
It's not safe to stay here too long.
You get that money tonight.
Maybe you're right.
I'll get going right away.
You...
Prof. King.
Dad.
Jean.
Dad, he didn't even know who I was.
Oh, nonsense, Jean.
And the way he looked.
He was like Prof. Kingsley and yet...
Dad, what is back of all this?
Haven't you guessed?
The operation I performed was a brain transplantation.
Then his brain...
Is partly the brain of Red Cannon.
Dad.
Your best friend.
Oh, you couldn't.
I saved his life, didn't I?
Well, what's the good if you've turned him into a criminal?
My only thought was to keep him alive, I swear it.
But when I saw signs of the gradual awakening of the Cannon brain,
I knew I'd made a great discovery for science.
Cannon's a gangster, a murderer.
All right.
But in the meantime,
I've proved what I always knew to be true.
Transplanted human brain cells will live and function.
What a triumph! Think of it.
I'm not a scientist, Father.
I can only see you destroying your best friend.
It's too late to think of that.
But you must.
Think what you're doing to him and Margaret.
Oh, he'll be all right.
As soon as I get him back to
Newcastle, he'll forget all about this.
But I can't do that until...
Until what?
Until the experiment is completed.
You've got to take him home tomorrow.
Why?
Because it's the only human thing to do.
Margaret is suspicious.
She threatens to call in a New York doctor.
Then the truth is bound to come out.
Don't forget, Dad, you had no legal right to operate.
It means prison, and every chance you might have had for a career in this country is lost.
Very well.
Tell Margaret we'll go back to Newcastle in the morning.
I'll tell her.
"Gang killer slays two detectives. "
You'd think the police would catch the killer by now.
A guy like that must be a lunatic.
If I got one look at him,
I could tell his type.
The same, sir?
Oh, hello, darling.
I sent you a message I was coming back to your dressing room.
Run home and pack.
Pack? Where are we goin'?
South America, for a starter.
Have we, um, money enough?
All the money in the world.
Understand?
All the money in the world.
Let me have the keys to your car.
I don't want taxi drivers hangin' around.
Yeah, sure.
You'll hear from me in an hour, and I'll have everything we need.
You ready?
What do you think?
He wants me to run away with him.
He's going to pick up the money now.
Good.
I knew he would, sooner or later.
We'll get it and split it three ways.
Well, that's all right with me. I'll point him out.
There he is, at the bar.
Just getting up.
He's taking my car.
It should be easy to follow.
How do you figure this guy?
When Red got hit, he couldn't have told everything he knew before he died.
I only know that Red is planted in a graveyard, and I'm not afraid of anyone else.
And me neither.
But knowing this guy knows everything Red knew kind of gives me the creeps.
He's leading us to half a million dollars.
We'll take that box.
Go ahead and shoot, if you want to dive 200 feet for it.
The money is what we want.
Hand it over and we'll give you a break.
Okay.
Come and get it.
Keep him covered.
You never saw the day I couldn't break you apart, Miller.
What's happened?
Where's Miller?
Get me something to open this.
Hurry.
Go get me a drink.
Then we're on our way.
Sunny, the split on this now is two ways.
Sunny.
Get in there.
You're late.
Where's Marnay?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.
Why is the bar open?
I was getting a drink.
I'm almost packed, and just waiting for you.
W- Why are you staring at me?
What's happened to you?
Marnay and Miller followed me from the nightclub.
Now I know why you didn't want me to come back to your dressing room.
They were there.
Red, what are you looking for?
Don't you believe me?
I haven't seen Marnay for six months.
Red, look at me.
There's never been anybody but you.
Believe me.
What were you saying?
Let me out!
I'll tell you where the money is. I hid it.
I hid it.
It's in the oven, Red.
It's in the oven.
Let me out. I'll tell you where the money is.
It's in the oven!
Let me out.
Let me out!
I swear.
No.
Let me out.
Out.
Please, don't hurt me.
Taxi.
Yes, sir.
Where to?
Westley Airport.
Yes, sir.
Pardon the yawn.
A hack driver that works all night shouldn't have kids.
All night you work your heart out for the woman and the little darlings.
All day long, while you're trying to snatch 40 winks, the old lady slams the doors.
The kids chase each other in and out of the room.
One kid jumps up on the bed, hops on your stomach,
"Daddy, tell me a story.
Tell me a funny story. "
I knock him out of the bed.
He screams.
The old lady calls me a tramp.
Home, sweet home.
I'll kill them.
Shut up. I don't like gabby taxi drivers.
Westley Airport.
Westley Airport.
What?
Westley Airport.
Drive me to the Midtown Hotel.
Midtown Hotel.
It's a crazy business, but it's a livin'.
Midtown Hotel.
Thank you. Keep the change.
Hey, you forgot your box.
George.
Ernest, something's happened to my mind.
I found myself in a taxi.
And I don't know how I got there.
Ernest.
Just a minute, George.
You know Margaret and Jean are here?
Margaret? Here?
Yes.
Now drink this.
I want you to get some rest before you see them.
Now, don't worry about a thing.
Tomorrow everything will be all right.
I hope you enjoyed your visit, Mr. Kingsley.
Very much, indeed.
Thank you.
May I have the bill?
Oh, no, George, allow me.
It was understood you were to be my guest, you know.
Mr. Kingsley?
Yes. That's my name.
The Chief of Police would like to see you.
Oh, really?
I don't even know him.
We'll introduce you.
What can the Chief of
Police possibly want?
Well, there can't be any charge against Prof. Kingsley, surely.
The Chief will explain all that.
Who are you?
I'm his doctor.
He's just recovering from an extremely serious illness.
Come along.
I'd like to go, too, if you don't mind.
All right. Come on.
Well, uh, you go ahead to the station, dear.
Yes, but George...
No, no, no.
It's all right.
We'll meet you there.
Goodbye.
This is Mr. Kingsley,
Chief.
And his doctor.
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
A cab driver tried to change this at the bank.
Circumstances were so unusual, we are holding him for investigation.
A thousand dol...
Look, Ernest, a $1,000 bill.
They really exist.
The cab driver said you gave him that for a tip.
The cab driver...
That's a kingly gesture.
I'm sure you honour me, but $1,000, why, that's almost six months' salary.
Bring the driver in.
What's your occupation,
Mr. Kingsley?
I'm... I'm a professor of English literature.
And I might add, a very underpaid professor.
Go on.
I tell you,
I've gotta get out of here.
My wife, she won't like havin' me stayin' in jail.
Is this the man that gave you that $1,000 bill?
How do you do?
Him?
Does he look like a $1,000 note to you?
The guy I was talkin' about was a gangster, who pushed me in the face.
Can you imagine him pushin' me in the face?
Oh, no.
That's all, Mr. Kingsley.
Sorry to have inconvenienced you.
Thanks for coming in.
Thank you.
We barely have time to catch the train, George.
Yes.
Back in Newcastle,
the Red Cannon brain has become completely dormant.
Kingsley has returned to his classroom,
and now I can actually bring to a realization
my plans for a great laboratory,
and give the world the benefit of my scientific knowledge.
Thus, you see, the Elizabethan novel was a minor passing form.
And fed the drama of the period which,
I might add, devoured it avidly.
I'm going to let you go a little early this afternoon.
Early, but not immediately.
And I'm quite sure you all will be glad to hear that tomorrow we're going to have a quiz on the past two weeks' work.
I must apologize for not giving you your full hour this afternoon, but my closest friend, Dr.
Sovac, is leaving Newcastle.
What was that?
What is it?
What's that noise?
What is it?
Why don't you answer me?
It's a siren.
Probably an ambulance or a police car.
Get a doctor.
Professor, maybe we can help you. What can we do?
Here you are.
Thank you, dear.
Gosh, Dad,
I hate to leave this place.
Seems so much like home to me.
I know, Jean, but at least
I'm going to a better position.
Of course, Dad.
Now I'll pack the rest of the books.
Oh, Dad, I've packed all your instruments.
Good girl, Jean.
Why, Pro...
Where is he?
Where is the doc?
I want my dough. Where is it?
You know where it is. You were sneakin' away with it.
What do you mean?
Tell me where it is!
Dad!
Stop it.
Red!
Ernst.
Why?
Why did you do it?
Why, Ernest?
I think you know the answer now, George.
I pronounce this man dead.
DVD Rip
Put that away.  
We've gotta get Lang alive. 
Hello, Barnett? 
This is Pete at Lang's place.   
Dr. Lang just drove out with Billy Batson.  
They took the Mill Valley Road. 
Mill Valley Road? All right.
I'll head 'em off.  
Mill Valley Road.   
Can't you go any faster?
I'll run him off the road.   
Billy! Billy!   
[ Coughs ]  
There's-- There's been an accident.
So I see.   
Are you hurt?   
No, but my companion, he's unconscious.   
We'll be glad to take him along too.  
Our orders were to get Lang, but the Scorpion will be glad to get Batson too. 
Now if you'll-- if you'll take me to--  
We know where to take you.  
Get in. 
Wh-What do you mean?
I said get in!  
The Scorpion!   
Yes, Dr. Lang, the Scorpion.   
It's a pleasure to see you here.
Please, be seated.  
Billy Batson was with him, so I brought him along. 
Splendid.   
Where's Batson? 
Downstairs under guard. 
He's unconscious.   
I'll attend to him when 
I finish with Dr. Lang. 
What do you want of me? 
Your lens to help complete the golden scorpion atom smasher.   
That's something I--
I'll never give you.
I think I can change your mind.   
Barnett, prepare to loosen  
Dr. Lang's tongue.  
Are you going to talk now, Dr. Lang?  
 Yes! Yes!  
 Anything you wish! 
Release him, Barnett.   
Where's your lens?  
In my library.  
There's a painting. 
 Behind the painting,   
 there's-- there's a safe.  
Write down the combination. 
Get the lens from Lang's safe at once.   
Yes, sir.   
Wait.   
Something should be done with Batson.
Do you want me to take care of him?
No. That's a pleasure   
I'm reserving for myself.   
I'll have him brought up. 
Wha-- What are you going to do with me?
Nothing, until I know your lens is where you say it is. 
[ Footsteps Approaching ]   
He hasn't come to yet.  
Well, get some water and bring him out of it.
Shazam! 
[ Screams ] 
Captain Marvel! 
Yes. Now I'll learn who you really are. 
And that gun of yours isn't going to stop me. 
But I think it will.
Dr. Lang will die if you come one step closer.
[ Rings ]   
Mr. Malcolm's secretary speaking.   
Who? Oh, Dr. Lang.  
- Let me talk to Malcolm.   
- Mr. Malcolm's out of town.
The Scorpion's men are after my lens.  
Can I be of any assistance? 
The safe in your library?   
Yes, that's right.  
It's in the alcove behind a painting.  
The combination is R-24--   
Now, Betty, repeat that combination to me. 
And then back to R-11.  
I'll start at once. 
Now, Betty, there's something   
I must warn you about.  
There's a death trap in the--
 [ Door Opens ] 
You're the Scorpion?
Dr. Lang! Dr. Lang! 
Betty-- Save her.   
Go to my house. 
Why?
Lens in my safe.
There's a death trap.   
Save her.   
Pete, we're gonna be busy inside. Understand?
Sure.   
Lock up the gates and keep out of sight.  
This must be it.
This is it! 
Open up those panels.   
Here's the combination. 
Right, 24.  
Shazam! 
Betty! Betty!   
Fix everything just the way you found it.   
And here's the combination. 
But he talked about some danger.
A matter of life or death, he said.
I think I know what he meant.  
There was a man with a gun as you drove up.
Really? Where is he?
He's been well taken care of. 
Let's go get that lens. 
He said it was in the alcove, didn't he?  
Yes, behind the painting.   
This is it. 
Read the combination to me. 
Right, 24.  
Left, 18.   
Right, nine.
Left, 16.   
Right, seven.   
Left, 10.   
And here's the last number: right, 11.
Hello, boys.
Any old tires you don't want?
The only old tires
I got I'm riding on.
Look, I didn't have money to go to the circus,
But not enough for the sideshow.
Save your money.
Plenty of freaks around here.
Hey, you think they got all the things they say they have?
Sure, the man told us.
Bet they ain't got no lions.
They have too!
The man let us see them.
He did?
Good thing they ain't got no teeth.
Sure they have!
Long as anything.
Let's you and me go see them.
You can go ahead.
We're going swimming.
Say, we're going past doc
Adrian's house, ain't we?
Sure.
We going right by the front of the house?
Sure.
What's the matter?
You scared?
I ain't scared of no crazy doctor.
Well, if you're coming, come on!
Wait, wait, you see, it's this way.
I got to get home for dinner
Or mom won't let me go to the circus.
All right, so you're afraid.
Well, you'd better stay here.
Get out of there, you little rotten...
Oh, no you don't!
Come on now.
Gee, look, he's got Willy.
Hello.
I can't understand why they don't do something
About doc Adrian.
Destroying all the values in this town,
Giving red creek a bad name.
Well, I think so, you're right, Mason.
He ought to have been run out of this town a long time ago.
Who ought to be run out of the town, Mason?
Dr. Adrian.
You should have been with us this afternoon.
He scared the women so bad they haven't got over it yet.
Yeah.
This town's too healthy.
Maybe he'll scare himself a couple of patients.
Understand them big doctors make a lot of money on
Nervous women.
It wasn't funny
When that epidemic broke out, Quinn.
You know as well as I do, he used a lot of those patients
As Guinea pigs.
I know nothing of the sort.
I know he did everything he could.
Two or three in this town wouldn't agree to that.
However, I can understand his reason for wanting
Patients now.
Well, he got himself another this afternoon.
Little Willy over there.
He ran after me, hurt me, and I wasn't doing nothing.
Poor child.
I think you're all yellow.
She's right.
And none of you got the courage to do anything about it.
Patients die on him, and now he's hanging around
Ms. Clifford's house experimenting with frances,
I guess.
You make a poor critic, Mason.
Your greed hasn't done this town any good.
What are you doing, preaching?
A little preaching wouldn't do you no harm.
What, with the people you squeeze dry and the usury
You charge on your loans.
Oh, I don't ask them to borrow!
I guess there's an answer for that also,
But I think it'd be wasted on you.
Business is business,
Quinn, and you know it!
Besides, we weren't talking about me.
Why don't we kick the doctor out and be done with it?
I'm ready any time you want to get started.
Oh, yes, that prescription.
I'll fill it in a second.
Been quite busy this morning.
I'm sorry to delay you, doctor.
Perfectly all right.
I can fix it myself.
It's none of my business, and maybe we men of science
Think different from other people, but if they
Ever find out in the village what you've been doing...
You mean about the animals?
Yes, some of the dogs have been missed.
Well, that phase of the experiment is all over.
I found out all
I need to know.
Can I help you?
Don't you think they need you in the store?
Just as you say, doctor.
Just as you say.
Well, that's good.
Enjoying the last of the summer?
Oh, doctor.
Doctor, sit down.
Thank you.
Oh, how's my girl today?
Oh, you're all dressed up.
Well, Danny phoned.
He's coming over.
So early?
He can't come tonight.
He's going to the circus.
Oh, yes.
The circus.
I almost forgot.
I've got a present for you, frances.
Oh, for me, doctor?
Well, now, don't get too excited.
Oh!
Just you wait
'til you open it.
It isn't anything at all now.
A jewelry case.
Oh, doctor!
Oh, it's beautiful!
But why so much, doctor?
You gave me a birthday present last month.
So I did.
Well, this is a make-believe birthday,
Just as you're my make-believe daughter.
Was she very like me?
She'd have been just 18 today.
She was to have worn that.
I couldn't save her, and I couldn't save her mother.
I hadn't the weapons to fight the disease that
Killed them, but I have now, or at least I've got
A knowledge of them.
10 years it's taken me.
Frances, you are going to walk again.
You're so intense, you frighten me sometimes.
So Danny's going to the circus, huh?
Yes.
Then he's coming back here afterwards and tell me all
About it.
Oh, he is, is he?
Well, why don't you go with him?
Oh, me?
Do you think she could?
- Oh, you're fooling.
- Why, of course she could.
I don't know why she shouldn't.
Hello, everybody.
Oh, Danny!
- Hi, doctor.
- Hello, Danny.
Hello, Ms. Clifford.
Well, Danny, how would you like
To take frances to the circus?
Well, gee, that'd be great, only...
Why, of course she can go.
We can take care of her.
I'll be back for you later.
Oh, thanks, doctor.
Now, don't you worry, Ms. Clifford.
Two strong men to look after her.
She'll be all right.
I'll be back later.
Goodbye, doctor.
Danny, I think you'd better run home and get
Yourself cleaned up.
You look as if you've brought all of the grease
From the garage with you.
You know, frances,
I think the doc's crazy.
I suppose I'll have to like him as long as he's nice to you.
He wants to be nice to everybody,
But people won't let him.
Well, I'm not saying
I believe all the things that...
Don't you believe any of the things they say
About him, Danny foster.
Well, all right, don't get excited.
Look, Danny, the stories they tell about the doctor
Are just as dirty as the grease on your hands and face.
Well, that about takes care of me.
So long, honey.
Goodbye, Danny.
Stay with it, doc.
Don't let it throw you.
Careful.
- There you are.
- There.
- Oh, that was easy, wasn't it?
- All right, frances?
- Oh, yes.
- All right. Right.
Okay.
Well, this time next year,
It'll take three men to lift you.
Oh, not three men, doctor.
If it did, they'd want to keep me in the circus.
Hop in, doc.
Oh, no, you can get somebody else at the circus
To help you lift her down.
What's the matter?
Aren't you coming?
- No, you two go on by yourself.
- Oh!
Now, you don't mind if
I change my mind, do you?
Oh, please, doctor.
You'll have much more fun together.
Off you go.
And don't forget to tell me all about it in the morning.
- We won't.
- So long, doc.
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye, doctor.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, mother.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, darling.
Have a good time.
Bye.
- Goodbye, doctor.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, mother.
- Goodbye.
Oh, come, come, come now.
This is no time for tears.
I know it.
I can't help it.
Ah, nonsense.
The change will do her a world of good.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Well, we made it.
Hey, did you see him, Mickey?
- Who?
- The gorilla.
Did you really see him?
Yeah, in the sideshow.
He's a big fella.
Is he bigger than three men?
That ape?
That ape is bigger than six men.
Six big men.
It's the biggest ape gorilla
In the whole world.
Look!
Here come the clowns!
Having a good time?
Yes.
You don't act like it.
Gee, everybody's looking at us.
I'm nervous.
What for?
Well, out with a married man and, you know.
Gee, this is the best circus I ever saw.
It's the only circus I've ever seen.
Get them while they're hot!
All right, officer.
Popcorn!
Right hot out of the oven!
Excuse me, Sonny.
Peanuts, five cents a bag!
Isn't she lovely?
She's so graceful.
Ah, she's not so hot.
I saw her passing the garage this morning.
Them costumes make a big difference.
That's what the doctor calls muscular grace,
Muscular coordination.
Honey, look over in that ring there.
See?
There you are.
You're all right now.
You'll be chasing bones in the morning.
What I've done to you I could do for man if they'd let me.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
That's all, honey.
I'm sorry it's over.
We'll never miss another circus.
What are you trying to do, drive that animal crazy?
Well, he's getting mean.
It's the only way
I can handle him.
You ever try a little kindness?
Nothing wrong with him.
Nabu.
Come here, nabu, old boy.
Come on now.
That's it.
Oh, two years ago,
He killed my old man, and I ain't gonna let him forget it.
Understand?
I know he did.
I was right here when he did it.
'Cause he was abusing him same as you're doing.
If you don't watch your step, he'll get you too!
Why don't you mind your own business?
You boys wouldn't be gambling, would you?
- Oh, no.
- Never.
Take me in.
That was a fine show you fellas put on.
You was the funniest clown I'd ever seen.
Oh, I rode a horse.
He was the clown.
- He was?
- Yeah.
Boy, he looks like a judge.
Hey, Jim, Pete, let's give them a hand.
Come on!
We can't handle it!
Sound an alarm!
Get the animals out!
Where's the nearest doctor?
Dr. Adrian.
Get something to put him on.
We'll take him.
Get him on there!
Somebody better get after that ape,
Or he'll tear this town wide open.
Pete, get a posse together.
Come on, boys.
Let's see what we can do about that fire.
A man badly hurt.
Sorry to bother you, doctor.
Bring him in here.
Come on, right here with him.
Oh, what happened?
An ape got him.
An ape?
Hope we scared him off in time.
This man's badly mauled.
You better get him into my laboratory.
Jane, you show them.
Well, now how did it happen?
Was he in the cage with the ape?
No, the circus burnt down, and the ape escaped.
The circus burned down?
And the audience?
They'd all gone home.
Oh, thank heaven for that.
Well, will you want us any further, doctor?
No, I'll take care of him.
Well, then come on, boys.
Let's get out and see if we can find that ape.
Don't let him get at me, mister.
Don't let him get at me.
You're perfectly safe here.
I'm a doctor.
Am I hurt bad, doc?
I'm afraid so.
I don't feel nothing.
Am I gonna die?
We all have to die sometime.
Oh, just don't let me die, doc.
Man.
The highest kind of animal.
Hey, doc, what are you gonna do with me?
I'm going to write you into medical history.
I'm going to keep a promise.
Wait here.
Keep your eyes open.
That sheriff ain't got no heart.
I'm so hungry,
I could eat hay.
Well, there's a barn full.
Help yourself.
George, you take your fellas,
And search the country up around cartier's farm.
Jim, you take your boys, and cover the West Side of town.
Pete, you stay with me.
All right.
How about joining them, Mason?
Let the circus people do their own work.
Why should we do it for them?
Well, the circus has burned down.
They've had trouble enough.
Well, that's their tough luck.
Well, if we don't find that ape,
Our own people might get hurt.
That's your job.
You're law and order.
And why should I worry about other people?
They don't worry about me.
You wouldn't be a little bit scared, would you, Mason?
Huh!
Well, don't be all day about it.
We're ready.
It gives a body the creeps to think of that critter
Roaming around.
Better keep the doors and windows all barred.
No telling who he'll go for next.
Are you all right, dear?
Mm-hmm.
Want some more?
What you thinking about?
I was thinking about that wonderful woman aerialist
I saw last night.
Oh, here comes Dr. Adrian.
Morning, Ms. Clifford.
Good morning.
Frances.
Oh, good morning,
Dr. Adrian.
I want to thank you again for the wonderful time I had
Last night.
Uh-huh.
It was too bad about that trainer, wasn't it?
Now, don't you think about him.
This is the most important day in your life.
Today we are really going to start her cure.
I found the serum that I need.
I'm going to walk, Dr. Adrian?
I hope so.
I'm not just thinking about you, frances,
But of all the sufferers in the world,
All the little boys and girls who can't go out into
The sunshine and play and have fun,
Who have to spend their lives in a wheelchair like you.
I'll do anything
I can, Dr. Adrian.
I know you will, my dear.
It's not going to be easy.
It's going to hurt, but when it hurts, don't be afraid.
Just remember that when the pain is gone,
It'll leave new life behind.
Huh?
I think we better get her ready.
All right, doctor.
Now, we've got him here and there and here.
Now, we don't get any results tonight,
We'll start in here and work west.
Oh, change your mind, Mr. Mason?
I never change my mind.
You got to have one first.
That's enough out of you!
Here's that dispossess orders on wilcox.
I want it served tonight.
We're busy tonight.
It'll wait 'til tomorrow.
Your duty is to take care of the citizens of this town!
Not fooling around chasing apes!
It seems you're in a mighty big hurry to make
People uncomfortable, Mason.
It's my business what I do.
Fine!
And it's mine what I do!
We'll get to this when we have time.
Goodnight.
Oh, doctor.
- Well, frances...
- Oh, my legs.
What?
They feel like lead.
I can't lift them.
But you never could lift them before.
Oh, I know, but I never felt them before.
You feel them, frances?
You feel them?
They're so heavy.
Well, that's good news, my dear.
That's what we were hoping for.
And it's only just the beginning.
If there's any change, you send for me immediately.
Yes, doctor.
Oh, mother.
Jane!
Jane!
Jane!
Look.
I succeeded.
It's there.
Life.
Life in that tiny bottle.
It's working.
The child will walk again!
Just go.
It's wilcox!
He's all torn up!
Ooh, we better get a doctor.
It ain't no good.
He's been dead for hours.
Let's notify the sheriff.
Right.
Doc!
Doc!
Hey, doc!
Yeah, what's wrong?
The ape's got wilcox!
Is there anything I can do?
No, no.
He's deader than a doornail.
Better be careful, doc.
Thanks.
I will.
Yes, Jane, you're safe.
But only you and I must know that he's dead.
Goodnight.
My legs hurt quite a little, Danny.
I know now Dr. Adrian is really going to cure me.
Well, if they hurts you, how can you be getting better?
Oh, you don't understand, Danny.
They never hurt before.
There was no feeling at all.
Now they feel alive.
Just the same,
I don't like it.
I don't like things
I can't understand.
Well, I don't understand either, Danny,
But I believe in him.
Oh, I have so much faith in him, Danny.
He says I'm like a daughter to him,
And I know he wouldn't hurt me, unless he had to.
It's part of the cure.
It's just got to be.
All right, I'll try to believe too for you,
But I'd rather carry you around all my life than have
Anything happen to you.
Hello, sheriff.
Any luck?
Not yet, but we'll get him.
Well, I hope so.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
There.
It looks like they picked up a scent!
Whoa!
Well, what got into him?
Hold on to him a minute, will you?
Yeah, you bet ya.
Hello, doc.
Haven't seen anything of that ape, have you?
Well, no,
I haven't sheriff.
Well, my dogs just acted
As if they've picked up a scent.
Well, I'd better be careful then.
Yeah, you better be.
Having trouble with insects, doc?
Yes, this is just a little mixture of my own I'm trying
To get rid of them with.
Well, if it works, let me know.
My yard's full of them.
Certainly will.
Thanks.
Henry, supper's ready.
Oh, you're going out?
Yeah.
Oh, but I made lamb stew with dumplings.
I don't care for lamb stew and dumplings, thank you.
Besides, the sheriff wants us out early to capture that ape.
You needn't lie.
I know where you're going.
Oh, you do?
Yes, everybody does.
So you've been listening to gossip, huh?
I can't keep people from talking to me and telling me
You found a new interest.
Suppose I have.
There's nothing I can do about it, I guess.
Keep that in mind.
But if you just wouldn't carry on here where we live
So people would stop pitying me.
Even if you go somewhere else!
Why don't you try going somewhere else?
But I have no one but you.
I have no folks.
I've got no place to go.
You've got the river!
Poor Mason,
I feel sorry or his widow.
Ah, she's better off.
Ah, that ain't funny when a man's been clawed to death.
I didn't like him when he was alive,
And I don't see any reason to like him when he's dead.
Just the same, it ain't right,
Even if he was no good.
We got to give that ape credit.
He only picks out the ornery cusses.
What makes you think you're safe?
Well, boys, you got yourselves some rest today?
About 40 winks.
We're plum tuckered out.
Well, maybe we can get some more people in to help us out.
Why don't we go out in the daylight?
Because he don't come out in the daytime.
The circus people told us we'd never get him then.
We got to catch him prowling after dark.
Think he's still hanging around the village?
He got Mason, didn't he?
And we found new tracks up around Dr. Adrian's house.
Oh, give me a sarsaparilla.
Quiet you.
Well, what do you think of that, sheriff?
Even the dogs don't like him.
Well, what got into them anyway?
Acting the same way around his house.
Don't make sense.
Maybe it's 'cause the doc
Looks so much like an ape himself.
This is no time for joking.
All of you be on the job tonight.
I'm scared, Ms. Clifford.
She looks almost... I'm really scared.
We must trust Dr. Adrian.
But we don't know.
He ain't got a patient in this town.
People don't hate a fella for nothing.
Do you hate him, Danny?
No, it's not hating him.
It's loving frances the way I do.
If anything happens to her...
I'm going down to see him.
I got to ask him.
I got to know.
Danny.
Danny's worried, isn't he, mother?
Now, you just rest, dear.
Danny will be all right.
Oh, if my legs didn't hurt so.
But I'm not afraid.
You aren't, are you, mother?
No, darling.
I want my little girl to walk again.
You ain't going in there, doc.
Now, what is this, Danny?
I'm scared about her.
I got to know what you're doing!
Well, surely, you want her to live a normal life like
Other people.
Well, sure, as long as nothing happens to her.
I love her just the way she is, doc.
I can take care of her.
I want to take care of her!
I don't want no experimenting on her!
But Danny, if through her
I could rid the world of...
I'm not in love with the world!
I'm in love with her!
I get it.
She's just a
Guinea pig to you.
Well, you got to stop it!
You got to stop hurting her!
Have you been to your garage today?
No, I ain't.
I've been too worried.
Well, you take care of your cars,
And I'll take care of my patients.
Now, just you run along.
I ain't running no place.
I ain't no doctor, and I don't know enough about what
You're doing, but if anything happens to frances...
Nothing's going to happen to frances.
Now, don't interfere.
Here comes Danny with the doctor.
How do you do, Dr. Adrian?
Ms. Clifford.
And how is my patient feeling this morning?
I'm all right.
She's been in great pain, doctor.
In pain?
Well, that's good.
- Good?
- Of course it is.
That's what we're looking for.
Now, you prepare her.
It's working.
- You say the name is Mason?
- Yeah.
Yes, doctor, initial h.
Anything in your examination to go into my report?
No, I believe not.
Well, I just said the death was caused by
A fractured vertebrae.
I guess that about covers it, doesn't it?
Yes, I should say that it would.
The reason I have sent for you, doctor,
Is because you examined the circus trainer when he was
Sent north.
And this case being a similar one to that,
I thought probably in your examination that you had
Discovered something that I had overlooked to put in my
Coroner's report.
I see.
This Dr. Adrian who's name is on the death certificate,
Is he the local physician?
Yes, if you can call him one.
Folks around here don't like him much, though.
And he was also called in on the case of the trainer?
Yes, yes, that's the same fellow.
He came here during the paralysis epidemic,
But the folks around here say that he experiments too much.
Thank you very much, coroner.
I believe you've given me all the information necessary.
That's fine, doctor.
Oh.
Oh.
Frances, what do you feel?
Oh, my legs.
They're hurting?
Oh, they hurt terribly.
Do you have more sensation than you had yesterday?
Oh, yes, much more.
Do you think perhaps you could walk?
Oh, no.
Then try to move your foot.
- Oh, I can't!
- You can!
Try!
No!
You can!
No!
You can!
No!
You can!
Oh, mother!
Oh!
It's working.
Oh!
Now you rest.
You rest, and I'll be back later.
Mother,
I know I'll be able to walk again.
I know, baby.
I know.
Dr. Adrian.
That's right.
I'm Dr. mcnulty from the Robinson foundation.
Oh, yes.
I had occasion to examine the body of a circus trainer
Who was killed by an ape here in this town.
Yes, sir.
I understand that you administered to the wounded man
Before he died.
I did my best for him, but it was quite hopeless.
In spite of the spinal injection you gave him?
I gave him no injection.
I just came from viewing the body of this man, Mason.
And I noticed a similar spinal puncture.
Did you examine him also?
Well, they called me in, of course,
But it was too late.
He was dead.
And you noticed no such puncture?
Well, the body was so badly mangled that...
Well, no, I didn't.
I see.
I understand they've had an epidemic of paralysis here.
That's true.
Many years ago, the
Robinson foundation found it
Necessary to expel from the institution a most promising
Young research worker because of his daring,
Unorthodox experiments with spinal fluid.
It was 25 years ago to be exact.
Then you are that
Dr. Bernard Adrian who's
Definite theories...
And in spite of what you did to me,
For 25 years, I've been engaged in proving those theories.
By what method have you been doing this?
I'm not in a position to disclose that at the moment.
I see.
Well, I'm afraid you leave me no alternative
But to report...
Wait.
If I could give you some small measure of proof,
Will you change your mind?
I doubt it.
Let me show you.
I'll show you.
You see, now, these two creatures were completely
Paralyzed, but after my treatment, well,
You can see for yourself, they're as lively and
Healthy as ever they were.
All this has nothing to do with the case.
But it has.
The serum that I used...
What became of the serum you took from those two men?
Now, you come with me.
Oh, doctor.
Hello, Ms. Clifford.
Now, this is Dr. mcnulty.
How do you do, doctor?
I would like to talk to frances.
She's asleep.
No, I'm not asleep, mother.
Hello, frances.
Hello.
Now, this child has had a complete paralysis of her
Lower limbs for 10 years.
Is that right, Ms. Clifford?
Yes, it is, doctor.
Have you had any feeling at all in your limbs since
Dr. Adrian has been treating you?
Yes, they've been terribly heavy,
And I've had a great deal of pain.
Pain?
Yes, and just a little while ago, I moved my foot.
Is that right?
That's right.
Will you do it again for me?
I can't.
Make an effort.
I can't.
Thank you.
That's all.
I think you'd better take her out into the sunshine.
Is anything wrong, doctor?
Why, no, frances, dear.
Of course not.
Well, her foot did not move,
But I did feel a definite muscular reflex.
Congratulations.
May I notify the foundation that you'll come back to us?
It's too late.
I have to stay here.
At least give me your promise to keep us informed
Of your progress.
Every step of the way.
Thank you.
It's not finished.
It's not finished.
Gee, look fellas.
Do you see something?
Yeah.
Do you have to wait until you see the white of his eyes?
Maybe they ain't white.
I'm gonna take a chance and shoot now.
Oh!
Oh!
Come here, Willy!
I don't care how busy you are, Jeff halliday.
I want my Willy found!
The idea of him wandering around in the dark with that
Gorilla loose!
Which none of you men seem able to capture.
Oh, it's all your nephew's fault!
He's always leading my little Willy astray!
But he's always under Mickey's heels!
Oh, ladies!
We've got work to do.
Your kids are just someplace where they shouldn't be.
Well, it ain't nothing new.
Have you looked down in Jones' barn?
I caught them smoking there last week.
We've searched the whole town.
Go take a look for them, Pete.
They ain't far away.
Sheriff!
Sheriff!
Where have you been?
We got him!
We got him!
Whoa, whoa.
What is it?
Mickey killed him and shot him dead.
Bang! Bang!
Between the eyes!
Hold it, kids.
What'd you shoot him with, Mickey?
My .22.
I got a good bead on him.
Where's your .22, Mickey?
He dropped it, sheriff.
I did not!
The ape grabbed it!
I'll ape you when
I get you home!
Ah, gee, ma, don't you believe us?
Where'd you see him?
On the pike about a quarter mile from doc Adrian's house.
All right, get them home.
Come on, Mickey.
Come on, Willy.
We're going home right now.
Come on.
Get out.
They probably shot a cow.
Yeah.
I'll look into it.
Where are the dogs?
Red's got them over on the other side of town.
All right, let's go.
Wait a minute, boys.
I want a word with the doctor.
I'll be right out.
Okay.
All right.
Is the doctor in?
Yes?
Sheriff.
Good evening, sheriff.
Just wanted to see if you were all right.
You ain't been out, have you?
No.
I'm trying to think out, doctor, a lot of things.
That ape seems to take a fancy to your place.
Now, don't take offense, doctor.
I'm just trying to clear up my mind.
Them dogs of mine have been sniffing the ape for days.
It's made them foolish, I guess,
Else why'd they snarl at you?
There may be some chemical odors on my clothes
That offended them.
Uh-huh.
But I ain't never seen my dogs offended at anything.
Can't understand it, doctor.
No.
Wait a minute.
Jane, just get me that torn coat of the trainer's,
Will you?
Now, this is an idea that's just occurred to me.
I don't know whether it makes sense or not,
But perhaps it will explain your problem.
You see, this coat was worn by the trainer when he was
Mauled by the ape, and it's been in the house ever since.
Now, that perhaps explains the interest of the ape in
This house and your dogs in me.
Now, then,
I'll bet you're right.
Well, I'll get along.
I think I'll put a few men around your house the rest
Of the night, doctor, just so you'll be protected.
Don't bother.
I'm perfectly safe.
They might interfere with some work that I have to do.
Well, maybe I'll just keep an eye out myself.
I'm just a bit scared, doc,
But don't tell anybody about it.
What's that?
This here is the coat that trainer was wearing when
The ape killed him.
Boy, did he rip that up.
One swipe.
Well, come on now, boys.
This isn't getting us anywhere.
We lay down on this job, our own coats will be in the
Same shape.
Come on.
Let's get busy.
All right, sheriff.
Now, you fellas get back to your positions.
- All right.
- You boys go up this way.
All right, sheriff.
I'll stay here.
I can't fail.
I can't fail.
Now, frances, dear, I want you to forget all the hours
You've spent in this chair.
Put them out of your mind.
You're not paralyzed.
You never were.
Fasten that firmly in your mind.
You're not paralyzed!
You'll do that for me?
I'll try.
Don't forget, you are not paralyzed!
Now, move your right leg.
Move it!
You can!
- No, I can't.
- Try! Try!
Stop it!
You're hurting her!
- I can't, Dr. Adrian.
- Quiet!
Try it, frances!
You can!
You know you can!
Move!
There!
You moved it, didn't you!
You moved it!
Now the left one!
Now the left one!
Now move it!
Try!
Try again!
There!
You moved them!
You moved them both, didn't you, dear?
All right, then, stand up and take a step towards me.
Do it!
Do it!
It's only your mind holding you in that chair,
Not your body.
Do it, I say!
Do it!
You see?
I told you.
Go get her some water.
Oh, she's all right, Danny.
She's better than she was, isn't she?
She needs more.
She needs more.
Take care of her, Danny.
I'll be back.
Oh, frances, darling.
Frances.
Name is halliday, sheriff over at red creek.
I had a job finding you.
Well, circus jobs are pretty hard to get, sheriff.
Well, all jobs are kind of scarce.
Your boys get that ape yet?
That's what I come about.
Didn't get him, huh?
That's bad.
He's a killer.
You boys got some responsibility tracking him
Down, haven't you?
Well, we did the best we could, sheriff.
The fire broke up the circus.
Some of the boys stayed there, didn't they?
Yeah, but that's not what I come about.
I just figured when you're looking for something,
It might help to know its habits.
Too many things about this animal I don't understand.
Well, animals is all alike.
Lions, elephants, dogs.
They all got one-track minds.
What do these gorillas live on?
He ain't killed any animals.
Shucks, no, they won't touch an animal,
Except out of meanness.
They live on fruits, vegetables.
Well, that's what's bothering me.
What's feeding this fella?
Maybe digging up a garden, a patch or two,
Or just eat a little bit of fruits.
No signs of it.
Checked with all the farmers.
Do they prowl around much, or do they stick in one place?
Well, a gorilla generally sticks to one place if he's
Got anything there to keep him.
We see evidence that this fella's
Hanging around one place.
That ape had it in for the trainer.
Where'd he die?
In the house of a doctor near the outskirts of town,
And that's the place we think
The ape's been hanging around.
Say, how would he trace the trainer to that house?
Well, sense of smell.
They're pretty good at that.
Did you bury him in town?
No.
We sent his body to his people up north.
That don't give us much, does it?
Any of his clothes around?
When that trainer was taken away,
His coat was left in the doctor's house.
Would that draw the ape there?
It certainly would.
You better get rid of them.
I was afraid my time might be wasted coming over here,
But I guess it ain't.
Thanks very much, Mr. howley.
I better be getting on the road.
I like to make home around nightfall.
Anything I can do for you, let me know.
Two injections should have been enough.
Take this record book, and keep it for me safely.
One more.
One more.
Pete, you two boys go over there by that shrub.
Danny, take your men down there
100 yards by that rail fence.
Okay.
Ah, sheriff, we've been watching there every night,
And so far nothing's happened.
Now, I'm getting... will you take orders?
All right.
All right.
You two boys go over by wilcox's barn.
Hey, you mean wilcox's barn?
Yes, wilcox's barn.
All right.
You two boys go down the road 100 yards.
You two wait for me over at that stone fence.
All right, sheriff.
Is the doctor here?
You sure of that?
He's not in there?
Say, sheriff, what's the idea of sticking around so
Close to the doc's house?
Because that attendant told me that ape would haunt
Any place where that trainer had been.
Oh.
Hey, what's getting into that sheriff?
He's getting touchy.
Lost his sense of humor.
You know, when a man can't laugh, it's just...
Hey, George, isn't this where we found the body?
Mm-hmm.
Do apes ever return to the scene of the crime?
They're noted for it.
Well, we got something to look forward to.
Ugh!
George!
George!
George!
What's the matter?
It got me.
Fire shots.
Come on!
Did you hear that shot?
Yes, but you told us not to leave here.
Where was it?
That way.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Did you fire that shot?
Yes.
It's tom.
The ape twisted his neck, but I didn't see nothing.
Can you walk?
Pick him up and carry him to the doctor.
No, I'm all right.
Go on. Get him!
He can't be far way.
Come on! Get out!
Get out with you fellas!
You boys come with me.
Doctor!
Look out, doctor!
It's the ape!
The ape!
Doctor, the ape!
Doctor!
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
Doctor!
Dr. Adrian!
Doctor!
Oh, let me go!
Don't stop me!
No, no, frances.
I'll see what's happened.
Frances!
Let me give him one, sheriff.
Hold on, that's enough!
He's done.
What are they doing?
What are they saying?
Oh, darling, I don't know!
It's the doc.
All right, boys, take that off of him.
Let me through!
Did the ape hurt him?
Let me through!
Let me through!
Dr. Adrian!
Frances.
Come to me, child.
Walk.
Walk.
There.
You see?
He's dead, boys.
Oh!
Hello, Danny.
No, wait, Danny.
Honey, you mustn't overdo it.
I'm doing better every day, Danny.
Oh, sure.
You're doing swell, but you got to take it easy.
I'll get your chair.
No, Danny!
Mother and I burned the chair yesterday.
I'm never going to use it again.
You bet you won't.
- How do you do, Mr. Van Cleve?
- Good afternoon, Your Excellency.
- Very kind of you to receive me.
- Not at all.
- Oh, please. Sit down.
- Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, but we're so busy down here.
Really, sometimes it looks as if the whole world is coming to hell.
Frankly, I haven't had an opportunity to familiarize myself with your case.
When did it happen, Mr. Van Cleve?
Tuesday. To be exact,
I died at 9:36 in the evening.
I trust you didn't suffer much.
Oh, no, no.
Not in the least.
I had finished my dinner... -
- A good one, I hope.
- Oh, excellent, excellent.
I ate everything the doctor forbade, and then... well, to make a long story short... shall we say,
I fell asleep without realizing it.
And when I awakened, there were all my relatives speaking in low tones... and saying nothing but the kindest things about me.
Then I knew I was dead.
I presume your funeral was satisfactory.
Well, there was a lot of crying, so...
I believe everybody had a good time.
It would have been an ideal funeral if
Mrs. Cooper-Cooper, a friend of the family... hadn't volunteered to sing
"The End of a Perfect Day."
You see, all my life I had succeeded in
avoiding Mrs. Cooper-Cooper's coloratura... and this undoubtedly was her revenge.
Mr. Van Cleve, I can see that you have a sensitive, cultivated ear.
Oh, thank you.
Then let me warn you.
The music down here is anything but pleasant.
Beethoven, Bach, Mozart... - you hear them only... above.
Yes. I know.
It won't be easy not to hear the old masters again.
And there are several people up there I would love to see.
Particularly one.
A very dear one.
- But I haven't a chance.
- Have you tried?
No, Your Excellency.
I have no illusions.
I know the life I lived.
I know where I belong.
I would like to get it over as quickly as possible.
Very well. If you meet our requirements, we'll be only too glad to accommodate you.
Would you be good enough to mention, for instance... some outstanding crime you've committed?
Crime? Crime?
I'm afraid I can't think of any.
But I can safely say my whole life was one continuous misdemeanor.
My dear Mr. Van Cleve, a passport to hell is not issued on generalities.
No. I'm afraid you'll have to wait until I have time to study your record.
Now look here.
I have to see His Excellency...
and no office boy's
going to stop me.
I beg your pardon, Your Excellency... -
- Just a moment.
- I'm Edna Craig.
Oh, yes. I have your record here.
You'll be taken care of in just a moment.
I don't want to seem rude, but I don't think I belong here.
- In just a moment... -
- Please don't misunderstand me.
I think it is a charming place.
Isn't it?
Henry Van Cleve.
You know Edna Craig?
I'm sorry, madam.
I seem to be at a loss.
Oh, Henry.
Think back... - many, many years.
The little brownstone house around the corner from the old Waldorf?
Oh.
Marmaduke Harrison's party.
We were all dressed as children.
And you came as, uh,
Little Lord Fauntleroy.
And they wheeled you in in a baby carriage.
Little Constantinople.
Oh, Henry.
No girl in New York walked on two more beautiful legs than you.
Little Constantinople.
Well, Henry, I still walk... - and on the same two legs.
And I'm sure they're still as beautiful.
Well, Henry, I'll let you be the judge of that.
Those things are better left to memory.
But I must admit you're beginning to interest me, Mr. Van Cleve.
I think I can spare the time to listen to your story.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Please sit down.
Perhaps the best way to tell you the story of my life... is to tell you about the women in my life.
Well, let's start with the first woman.
My mother.
A lovely lady, but prejudiced.
She thought I was wonderful.
She was the first woman I ever fooled.
Then there was my grandmother.
She was just as prejudiced
as my mother.
How is the little darling?
Let me hold him.
No. Please, Mother Van Cleve.
Let the baby rest.
- You're just jealous, Bertha.
- I can't stand this any longer.
- I'm going to speak to Randolph about this.
- Yes, Randolph.
First you take my son away, and now you want to alienate my grandchild.
My diapers needed changing,
and already women were fighting for me.
What a way to start a man
on the road oflife.
I was not even two,
and I already got involved in a triangle.
At home, in the presence of my family,
I was the only man in my nurse's life.
I was her honeybunch,
her "oogi-woogi-woo."
But the minute we got to the park... -
Hello, Bedelia.
Well, if it isn't Patrick himself.
Ah, shut up, you nasty little brat.
No wonder I became a cynic.
My next lesson
came from little Mary.
- Hello, Mary.
- Don't speak to me, Henry Van Cleve.
You're a bad boy, and my mother says
I shouldn't talk to bad boys.
I bet you don't know what I've got in this box.
And I'm not interested,
Henry Van Cleve.
Then I won't tell you it's a beetle.
A beetle?
- Do you like it?
- Oh, who doesn't like beetles?
- It's yours.
- Thank you.
Oh, thank you, Henry.
- I wonder if I should take it.
- If you don't want it... -
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.
I was just wondering.
Don't worry.
I've got another one.
- Another beetle?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, it's beautiful.
It looks rather lonely though.
You know what I think?
I think it wants to be together with mine.
You mean you want this one too?
Henry Van Cleve! Do you think I'm the kind of girl that would take a boy's last beetle?
Aw, that's all right.
You can have it.
Thank you, Henry. Now, if you want to, you can walk with me to the corner.
From that moment on,
one thing was clear to me.
If you want to win a girl,
you have to have lots ofbeetles.
I was growing rapidly,
and so was New York.
Yes. New York was becoming
cosmopolitan...
and no household was considered fashionable
without a French maid.
So, one day a Fifth Avenue coach
stopped in front of our house...
and out of the coach
and into my life came Mademoiselle.
Mrs. Van Cleve will be here shortly.
Merci.
That's Mr. Van Cleve.
Oh, Monsieur.
Charmant, charmant.
This is Mr. Van Cleve's father.
He lives here too.
Grandpapa.
Sweet. Very sweet.
And who is this darling little boy?
That's the young master.
He's not so darling.
- Bad boy?
- Not good.
- Good morning.
- Bonjour, madame.
How do you do, mademoiselle?
- Your name is, uh... -
- Yvette Blanchard.
- Yvette Blanchard.
- Oui.
The agency tells me that you've just arrived from France.
- Oui.
- And are seeking employment in this country.
- Oui, madame.
- Uh, you have references?
- Oui, madame.
- May I see them, please?
Naturellement.
- Voilà.
- Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, they're in French.
Oui, madame. But believe me... -
toutes les références... - excellentes.
Here, my last employer... -
Baroness Lalotte... wishes me to be such grand success in America... that I shall never have desire to return to France.
Ah. The French have such a... continental way of expressing their gratitude.
Um, and here a référence from the duc de Polignac.
He considers the two years
I spent in his house... the two most happy years of his life.
Oh, it sounds just like a duke.
Um, what about your wages?
Uh, maybe in beginning $20 a month would give satisfaction?
Twenty dollars a month!
You see, I've never gone higher than $14 a month for a personal maid.
If I could only justify the difference.
Let me see.
- Oh, Mother?
- Come here, dear.
- Mademoiselle, this is my little boy.
- Bonjour, mon petit.
- Hello.
- He studies French.
Oh, mademoiselle, you must ask him something in French. But not too difficult.
Oui. Avez-vous bien travaillé
aujourd'hui, mon chéri?
Huh?
That's what I was afraid of.
Now be a nice boy and go. I have an idea that I want to discuss with Mademoiselle.
A brilliant child, but a little backward in his French.
- And it just occurred to me that... -
- Oh, madame.
It will be pleasure talk only French to little fellow.
My whole vocabulaire
I make present to your baby.
With me in house, in one month I assure
Madame will not recognize own son.
And only for $20.
Of course, that's six dollars more than I ever paid before.
- But let's try it.
- Merci, madame.
- Au revoir, madame.
- Good-bye, mademoiselle.
Psst! Hey.
Oui?
You're not gonna work here.
I'll see to that.
What is the matter?
Did I make little boy angry?
Now see here. That's the last time anybody's gonna call me "little boy."
Oh, so sorry if I hurt feelings, but maman... -
Yes. Mama.
That's the trouble.
Mama and Papa.
And Grandpapa and Grandmama.
It's a conspiracy to keep me in short pants.
They think they own me, body and soul.
Ah, je comprends. My understanding for young man is perfect.
Your soul is bigger than your pants.
Oh, you need very warm friend with sympathy.
Moi. I will be. Oui?
I bet you couldn't guess in a million years what I have in my pocket.
No, I do not know, but I am sure it is something very bad, oui?
- Here.
- Oh, you smoke big black cigar?
Sure, I'm gonna smoke it... - any day now.
Now we have very bad secret together, oui?
That's nothing.
I can tell you things that would rock
Fifth Avenue to its foundations.
Oh?
- I'm going to get married.
- You, married?
Mmm.
I have to, darn it.
Oh, this is much worse than cigar.
When did disaster take place?
Oh, it all happened pretty suddenly.
There's a girl around the corner.
Well, you know.
But I do not know.
Tell me.
Well, we were walking in the park, and it started to rain.
- Oui?
- We climbed into a policeman's shed.
- And the policeman?
- He wasn't there.
Well, anyhow, before I knew it, I lost my head.
I don't know what got into me.
- I took her into my arms and then... -
- And then?
I kissed her.
I may just as well face the consequences.
Excuse my asking question.
This might sound very childish to grown-up young man... but did you ever consider idea not marrying girl?
It's out of the question.
It would destroy me socially.
I could never go to Harvard.
Why, when my father kissed my mother... she knew what he meant, and he knew she knew it.
écoute, mon chéri.
In your papa's time, papa kiss mama and then marry.
But this is 1887.
Time of bicycle. The typewriter has arrivé.
Soon everybody speak over the telephone.
And people have new idea of value of kiss.
What was bad yesterday is lot of fun today.
There is a wonderful saying in France.
"Les baisers sont comme des bonbons...
qu'on mange parce qu'ils sont bons."
This mean kiss is like candy.
You eat candy only for the beautiful taste... and this is enough reason to eat candy.
Y-You mean I can kiss a girl once... -
Ten times, 20 times.
And no obligation.
Listen, are you telling me the truth or just trying to keep your job?
I'll swear by the extra six dollar
I get from Madame.
Gosh. This is a wonderful age
I'm living in.
Oui. So you do not have to worry about little girl.
Oh, I've forgotten about her already.
I guess I'm pretty blasé.
- Listen, Frenchy.
- What is it, my friend?
If that's the way things are in 1887... what do you think's gonna happen in 1888?
Aha. We make that the subject of our first French lesson.
Au revoir, monsieur.
- Mother.
- Yes, my baby.
That girl is worth the extra six dollars.
The pride
of all the Van Cleves was my cousin Albert.
He was the fulfillment of a parent's dream.
Always the highest in his class.
Never had he thrown a stone into a window.
Nor did he ever put a mouse
in his teacher's bustle.
His ears were always clean.
This, I think, will give you
a rough idea of Albert.
And I'll never forget
the morning of my 15th birthday.
The presents were waiting for me
in the living room.
But suddenly Father came running
down the stairs, excited and breathless.
Flogdell! Flogdell!
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.
Tell Robinson to go immediately and get Dr. Macintosh.
- Tell him our little Henry is ill.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, my poor baby.
The boy's acting so strangely, Randolph.
Randolph.
Now, Bertha, Bertha.
We must keep a stiff upper lip.
Randolph, he's talking all the time as if he were in a delirium.
- What does the boy seem to be saying?
- Well, if I only knew, Randolph.
- He's talking French. Nothing but French.
- French?
Oh, Randolph.
Our boy, delirious in a foreign language.
Now, Bertha, Bertha. This is an emergency.
We must do everything step-by-step.
The next move is to find out what the boy is saying.
Uh... - Uh, Flogdell.
- Yes, sir.
- Tell Mademoiselle to come to
Master Henry's room immediately.
Very good, sir.
If only Grandpa would let me rub just a bit of garlic on his little chest.
Stay away from that boy with your garlic.
The boy's sick enough.
Randolph, did you hear that?
Did you hear that, Grandpa?
I'm not deaf.
The child's poisoned.
That's what it is.
Oh, Randolph. What shall we do?
Oh, what shall we do?
Now, now. There's only one thing to do, Bertha... - keep a stiff upper lip.
But that won't help that poor poisoned boy.
If I had my way,
I know what I'd do.
A big glass of cold water right in that boy's face, and I think he'd start talking English.
- Hugo, you barbarian.
- Oh, no! Please, please!
- You'll give him pneumonia.
- You mustn't do that.
- Please, you mustn't... -
- He might... -
- Oh, Mademoiselle.
- Did Madame send for me?
Yes, Mademoiselle.
Our little Henry.
- He's sick?
- Yes, Mademoiselle.
Oh. Excuse, Madame.
I'll be right back.
- Oui, Madame?
- Mademoiselle, he's asking for something in French.
- You must help us find out what he wants.
- Oui, Madame.
- Look. He's smiling.
- He's far, far away.
- Why, he seems to be in another world.
- He's looking at Mademoiselle.
- I wonder what he sees.
- Yes. I wonder.
Oh, je suis si malade.
Mon estomac me fait si mal.
- Is he clear?
- Does it make any sense?
Oh, his French is absolutely perfect.
Such beautiful grammar.
Mademoiselle, at the moment we're not concerned with the young man's linguistic accomplishments.
- Don't be harsh.
- I'm sorry if I seem to have lost my temper, but the occasion is a trying one.
If you could tell us what the child is saying, it might help us to meet the situation.
Must be contagious disease.
Son, step out with me a moment.
- Good morning!
- Morning, Albert.
- Shh! Hush.
- What's going on?
Now, Son, you still don't know what's the matter with that boy?
Father, I wouldn't presume to make a diagnosis.
- After all, I'm not a man of medicine.
- Randolph, how old are you?
What an odd question, Father.
I'm 43.
Well, I think you are definitely old enough to be told the facts of life.
- What are you driving at, Father?
- Now, Son, don't look at me with those big wandering eyes.
It breaks my heart, but I'll have to shatter your childhood illusions.
Randolph, my son, there is no Santy Claus.
And that child of your... -
Listen, don't you really know what's the matter with him?
- You get out of here!
- Bertha, what is it?
- Randolph, call the police at once.
- Yes. Call the police.
Quiet! Quiet!
We don't need the police.
Bertha, Mother. I wish someone would take the time to explain to me what this is all about.
Believe me, Monsieur, the excitement is greatly exagéré.
- How dare you speak.
- Have you no shame?
- Oh, please, Grandpapa.
- Don't you call him Grandpapa!
- Don't you dare call him Grandpapa!
- Girls, girls... - Shut up!
Go ahead.
Call me Grandpapa.
Merci, Monsieur. Merci beaucoup, Monsieur.
You are very kind.
Yes, I'm very kind, but you'd better go and pack your things now.
And if you're not out of the house in a very little while, I'll come down to your room and help you pack.
I wish you would, Grandpapa.
- Oh, shameless, shameless!
- Leave this house! Go!
There is old French saying: If you are thrown out of house, you better resign.
Au revoir.
I still would appreciate it if someone would tell me what all this has to do with our little Henry.
Fortunately, Uncle Randolph,
French always being one of my favorite subjects...
I was able to understand the incredible conversation between Henry and Mademoiselle.
- I, uh, don't know how to begin.
- All right, all right.
Henry had a glass of wine.
We all know that.
Henry? Intoxicated?
From what I overheard, at or about 10:00 last night...
Henry and this... - this foreign young woman slipped out of the house.
Before doing this, however, Henry wrongfully took possession of his father's dress clothes... including $20 which Uncle Randolph was negligent enough to leave in his pocket.
Imagine. They went to Delmonico's.
- Did they have a good time?
- They drank champagne.
Our little baby drank champagne.
- Well, thank you, Albert.
- But that's not all, Grandfather.
It seems, from what I could gather, that Mrs. Asterbrook, of the Asterbrooks... who was sitting at an adjoining table... resented bitterly the idea of Henry dropping a nickel into her décolletage... and complaining to the management because no chocolate bar dropped out of Mrs. Asterbrook.
Mrs. Asterbrook?
How can I ever face her?
What a disgrace!
I'm going to teach that boy a lesson.
Yes, that's what he deserves... - throwing nickels around like that.
Knowing the Asterbrooks, I can tell you right now we'll never see that nickel again.
I have reached my decision.
That boy is going to be spanked... - and severely.
Oh, Randolph, don't hurt him.
Please don't hurt him.
- No, no, Randolph.
- Please, please. He's such a baby.
- Well, I assume there will be no further birthday celebration.
- I'm afraid not.
I believe I can utilize this time very beneficially, so I'll say good-bye.
Good-bye, Albert.
You're a real credit to the family.
Thank you, Grandfather.
It was a Sunday morning,
the day of my 26th birthday.
Oh, that boy.
Well, at least poor Grandmother... - may her soul rest in peace... - was spared seeing a day like this.
Oh, Randolph. Randolph, where can he be?
Where can he be?
Now, now, Bertha.
I'd like to give you some consolation... but all I can say is chins up.
Oh, Randolph, where does he get it from?
I give up, Bertha.
I never gambled in all my life.
I never got entangled with any girl until I met you.
- Randolph, you call it entangled?
- I mean you entangled my heart.
Oh, of course, Randolph.
We entangled each other's heart.
Believe me, Bertha, I never knew what a musical comedy girl looked like.
What can he possibly derive from their company?
To me, they were creatures from another planet.
Where does he get it from?
Nobody in our family was musical.
To this day I wouldn't know how to find the stage entrance to a theater.
It's always around in the back up an alleyway.
There's a sign over the door:
"Stage Entrance." You can't miss it.
But I'm not interested, Father.
I never was.
Where does the boy get it from?
Where does he get it from?
Father built up the Van Cleve
Importing Company from nothing.
When he stopped, I carried on.
Dad, you must admit, from the day I left Harvard,
I earned every dollar I ever spent.
Then why do you give him money without making him work for it?
I have to save the family name. What about you handing him hundreds of dollars?
- If I'd come to you for money, would you have given it to me?
- No.
But you give it to him.
Why? Why? Why?
Because I like him.
Does that mean, by any chance, Father, that you don't like me?
Son, I love you.
Now shut up and leave me alone.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Aunt Bertha.
- Good morning, Albert.
- Good morning, Grandfather.
- Morning, Albert.
- Good morning, Uncle Randolph.
- Good morning, Albert.
I just came in to bring a little birthday remembrance for Henry.
Anything wrong?
Isn't he home?
If I know my cousin Henry, he's probably still in church.
I mean that humorously.
Albert, I'm struggling successfully against the gout...
I'm waging a terrific battle with my liver, and I'm holding my own against asthma... but I doubt if I have strength enough to survive your jokes.
You're a successful lawyer.
Let it go at that.
I love you, Albert.
Uh, it was sweet of you to drop in, Albert.
I hope he'll be here tonight to thank you.
I hope so too, otherwise I'd be in the most embarrassing position... as far as my future in-laws are concerned.
We're so eager to meet your fiancée.
How does she like New York?
Yes. Is she enjoying herself?
Well, she's only been here two days, so naturally the impression is overwhelming.
I took her to the aquarium. We rode up and down the elevator in the Flatiron Building... and naturally, we ended up in Grant's Tomb.
Naturally.
Uh, and her parents?
Oh, yes. How does the big
Kansas City butcher like New York?
- Now, Father, please.
- I assume that you're referring to... my future father-in-law, who happens to be one of the great meat-packers of our time.
Yes, Father Van Cleve. Don't you realize that every piece of beef we eat... comes from one of
Mr. Strable's many, many plants?
Does that include the steak
I fought 10 rounds with last night?
Grandfather, you don't seem to have any idea of the importance of Mr. Strable.
He created the most famous character in American advertising... - Mabel, the cow.
You've seen her, Father, on billboards.
That big, happy cow smiling at you over the fence... and saying in big letters, um, uh... -
How does it go?
"To the world my name is Mabel, which you'll find on every label.
I am packed by E.F. Strable, for the pleasure of your table."
No cow in its right mind could have said anything like that.
- Sounds more like Mr. Strable.
- Grandfather, please, I beg of you.
The family understands your humor, but it's a typical kind of New York humor.
In other words, it's not for yokels, huh?
I beg your pardon, sir. Mr. Henryjust came home.
He went directly upstairs.
Aunt Bertha, when you see Henry, will you tell him that as a Van Cleve...
I have the right to demand that he keep the shadow of scandal off our name?
You see, my future in-laws are, so to speak, pioneer people, and... -
"Packed by E.F. Strable...
for the pleasure of our table."
Holy smoke!
- Good-bye, Aunt Bertha.
- Uh, good-bye, Albert.
- Well, this time I was firm.
- Good, Randolph. What happened?
He asked for a hundred dollars, but I told him.
I told him I'd let him have only 50.
- Randolph... -
- And not right away.
For the first time in 27 years of marriage,
I feel like criticizing you.
What do you want me to do?
Spank a 26-year-old boy?
No, but at least I expected a verbal lashing.
- Are you all right, my boy?
- Yes, Mother.
Many happy returns of the day. Ohh.
Mother, I'm sorry if I made you unhappy.
Oh, Grandfather and Father and I are worried to death about you.
You don't give your family a single thought.
All you think about is having what you call a good time.
Mother, I went out last night to raise Cain.
- Son, you mustn't talk like that.
- Don't worry. I didn't.
I couldn't.
I couldn't get her out of my mind.
Son, you worry me.
Are you well?
Mother... when you saw Father for the first time, did you feel that unmistakable something?
Did you feel an electric spark from your head right down to your toes... that swept over you like a hurricane and threw you to the ground... but you bounced up again and floated over the treetops?
Spark? A hurricane?
Heaven forbid.
I never had such a feeling.
Henry, where do you get it from?
Not from me. And certainly your father never had any spark.
Mother, all I'm trying to say is...
I met a girl yesterday.
Oh. I hope she comes from a good family.
I don't know.
And frankly, I don't care.
Mother, when one sees a lovely rose... -
One can be certain she comes from a fine rosebush.
Mother, even if this girl's father turned out to be something of a buttercup, I wouldn't care.
What's her name?
Where does she live?
I wish I knew.
She isn't one of those musical comedy girls?
Oh, no, Mother.
It's an entirely different kind of music.
It's not the hootchy-kootchy.
It's not the cancan.
It's like a waltz by Strauss.
Like a minuet by Mozart.
Henry, where do you get it from?
From you, Mother.
Now, you must be just.
When I was a little boy, you wanted me to believe in fairy tales... and now that one has really happened... -
You remember that story about the young man... -
I think he was a shepherd who was walking in the woods... -
Oh, you've been in the country.
No, no, Mother.
It happened right on Broadway.
Suddenly the young man saw a big castle... and leaning out of the window was the most beautiful princess.
Nothing could stop him.
He climbed up the parapet of the castle... -
Henry. You haven't broken into the Waldorf again?
Mother, darling, let's forget the fairy tale.
Well, it's about time you grew up.
I came here to scold you, and I'm going to do it.
Now, look at your cousin Albert.
Not much older than you are and already a corporation lawyer... engaged to a lovely girl of a well-known family.
Henry, now, this may sound severe, but you've got to pull yourself together and settle down.
Mother, I don't think I'll ever find this girl, but if I did, then all your troubles would be over.
If she didn't want me to gamble,
I wouldn't look at another card.
I'd stay home every night.
Mother, I might even go to work.
Henry, that's wonderful.
I don't know about the girl... but the fact that you have the desire to settle down makes me so happy.
For the first time you're beginning to sound like your father.
Uh, Mother, I don't know where this girl is, so don't expect too much.
Oh, now listen to your mother.
Don't worry about that girl.
Another girl will come along.
- I'll look for one myself. How's that?
- Fine. Fine, Mother.
And when I find a girl for you, she'll be Miss Right.
And do you know where we'll find her?
In the home of Mr. and Mrs. Right.
Oh, Henry, you're making me so happy.
Mother, I was riding around for hours and hours trying to forget this girl.
Oh, child, don't worry.
Well, it was very expensive.
The cab is still waiting out in front... and the driver was so nice to me that I promised him, if... -
I know. Your heart's always bigger than your father's pocketbook.
Look under your pillow.
I put something there last night.
Oh, Mother.
Sometimes I wonder if you're not spoiling me.
- Here, dear.
- Oh, thank you.
Well, this is a great occasion.
You must be proud of your Albert.
- Yes, I think we have a pretty good son.
- Oh.
- I hear the Strable family... -
- We couldn't ask anything better for our Albert.
- Oh, wonderful.
- Mr. and Mrs. Strable and Miss Strable.
Good evening, Grandfather, Aunt Bertha,
Uncle Randolph, dear, dear family.
It is my privilege and honor to present Mr. and Mrs. E.F. Strable.
And last but not least, well... here she is.
- How do you do, madam?
- How do you do?
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to the pleasure of meeting you.
All my life I've wanted to see the wide-open spaces.
Well, if Muhammad can't go to the mountain, the mountain must come to Muhammad.
You're welcome, Mrs. Strable.
- Yes, we're pretty proud of Kansas.
- Naturally.
And you, Mr. Strable, welcome to our family.
Mr. Van Cleve, we people from the West don't talk much... but when we say something, we mean it.
- Thank you.
- Thank you for giving me the chance... to meet the man who feeds the nation.
I hope this will be the beginning of a lifelong friendship.
May you lie as solidly anchored in our hearts as you do in our stomachs.
And, uh, Grandfather, this is Martha.
So, this is Martha, huh?
Well, Martha.
- Yes, Mr. Van Cleve?
- Grandpa.
- Yes, Grandpa.
- If I were about 50 years younger...
I'd take you right away from that s... - splendid young man you're going to marry... and who is going to make you a wonderful husband.
Kiss your grandpa.
- Well, I see the mob has assembled.
- Yes, sir.
- Flogdell, is that... -
- That's Mr. Strable.
And that spreading chestnut tree under which Grandfather is standing?
That's Mrs. Strable.
And, uh, where's the lucky girl?
Standing beside your Aunt Minetta with her back to us.
She's just turning round.
Charming young lady, if I may say so.
Flogdell, I don't think
I can stand this party.
- Get my hat and coat.
- But, sir.
My hat and coat.
- Henry! There you are. Many happy returns.
- Thank you.
And now it's about time for you to come and meet the Strables.
- Where are you going?
- Out.
I beg you to stay and behave like a Van Cleve just once.
The Strables know it's your birthday, and they want to congratulate you. Oh, Martha. Martha.
- Yes, Albert?
- Dearest, I want you to meet Henry Van Cleve.
This is the cousin whose birthday we're celebrating today.
Many happy returns, Mr. Van Cleve.
- Cousin Henry.
- Cousin Henry.
- Thank you, Cousin Martha.
- Well, here she is, Henry.
Now I've done my duty bringing some new blood into the family. It'll be your turn next.
- That's most unlikely.
- Oh, nonsense.
All you need to do is to meet the right girl.
That's difficult, Albert.
I'm afraid I'll never have your luck.
Yes. No question about it. I'm lucky.
Well, shall we go in?
Father Strable. Father Strable.
Don't be afraid.
I should have told him.
It would have been the thing to do.
It shall remain our secret.
I promise.
Thank you.
Yes, we had a secret.
The most innocent secret I ever had.
It happened Saturday morning
in Wannamaker's Department Store.
Hello, Mother? I'm at the hairdresser's.
They're still doing my hair.
Yes. Oh, yes. just a moment, and I'll ask them how long it'll be.
Here was a girl lying to her mother.
Naturally, that girl interested me at once.
They say it'll take about 15 more minutes.
I'll be home at the most in half an hour.
Don't worry, Mother.
Good-bye.
Why was this angel lying to her mother?
I had to find out,
so I followed her.
But even if she hadn't lied to her mother,
I would have followed her anyway.
- May I help you, miss?
- Thank you.
I would like to see a... -
Are there no women clerks?
Unfortunately not.
But it might make you feel a little easier... if I tell you that I'm the one usually chosen by the management to handle... the more delicate situations.
As a matter of fact, they call me
"the bookworms' little mother."
Well, it's, uh... -
- Maybe I better come back some other time.
- Please, miss.
My employer is watching, and if he sees me losing a customer, it might cost me my job.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Naturally, I wouldn't like to deprive you of your livelihood.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you again and again.
- Well, the title of the book is, uh... -
- Yes?
I saw it in the corner of the second window... between To Have and to Hold and When Knighthood Was in Flower.
Hmm.
There you are.
I probably should apologize.
I imagine I should have called you madam.
No, it's still miss.
- But not for long, I presume.
- That's quite right.
- How much is the book?
- Oh.
We'll be only too glad to charge it if you would be kind enough to give me your name and address.
Thank you, but I'd rather pay.
How much?
- Uh, it's very expensive.
- Oh, that's all right.
Now, this is against the interests of Mr. Brentano... but since I am, so to speak, your literary confessor...
I must be honest with you.
Don't buy this book.
You don't need it.
I'll tell you something much more appropriate for you.
Leave your nest and fly away with me.
Well, I might buy that book too... -
Well, we don't have it in stock right now... but I'd love to discuss the idea with you, and if you like it... -
I'm afraid I haven't much time.
So, please, will you tell me?
How much is
How to Make Your Husband Happy?
Look at her. Dr. Blossom Franklin.
Now where could a woman like that
have found out how to make a husband happy?
You certainly don't want to learn anything from her.
You're so charming, so young and so beautiful.
I beg your pardon.
You shouldn't say such things.
You see, miss, when selling literature, one gets poetic.
And you must forgive me if I take poetic license once in a while.
I'd rather not discuss it any further, and if you don't mind, I'd like to buy this book.
I do mind. Now, imagine
I'm the man you're going to marry.
I couldn't imagine any such thing.
Well, what's the matter with me?
You think I'm that terrible?
Please. I just came in here to buy a book.
That's all.
I understand. But for the sake of discussion, let's say we are getting married.
Believe me. I don't want anybody to tell you how to make me happy.
The greatest gift you could bring me is to be just as you are... - adorable.
- All I want is a book.
- Stubborn, eh?
- What?
- Pardon my poetic license.
If you don't change your attitude,
I shall have to complain to your employer.
I'm not employed here.
I'm not a book salesman.
I took one look at you and followed you into the store.
If you'd walked into a restaurant,
I would have become a waiter.
If you'd walked into a burning building,
I would have become a fireman.
If you'd walked into an elevator,
I would have stopped it between two floors, and we'd have spent the rest of our lives there.
Please forgive me, but you can't walk out of my life like that.
I think your behavior's outrageous.
It's mad.
- I must insist that you leave me at once.
- Never. Never.
Is this man annoying you, miss?
If he is, just say so. I'll take care of him.
Am I annoying you?
Tell the officer.
No. The gentlemen was just saying good-bye.
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.
This was our terrible secret.
I'm terribly sorry, Albert.
Dearest, you don't seem to realize who's singing.
I know. Young Mrs. Cooper-Cooper.
If it were just a relative, it wouldn't be half so embarrassing.
But Mr. Cooper-Cooper is one of your most important clients. I haven't forgotten.
But what could I do?
I had to sneeze.
But you did it right in the middle of her aria... - and five times.
Because I had to sneeze five times.
Albert, suppose someday in the future
I had to sneeze... -
Then you sneeze.
Naturally.
Don't you worry. After all,
I'm taking you for better or for worse.
Do you think you may have to sneeze again?
- I don't know. I can't guarantee it.
- Well, then let's not take any chances.
Why don't you go in the library and rest a while and see how things develop?
Make yourself comfortable.
Read a book.
I think I'd better go back for the encore.
Yes, dear.
- Cousin Henry.
- Yes, Cousin Martha?
You must never do anything like that again.
Is that what you came back here to tell me?
I think it's outrageous.
I hardly know you.
Why, even Albert, my own fiancé, never dared to... -
- Kiss you?
- Of course he kissed me. Why not?
After all, we're engaged.
- But he never kissed me like that.
- Like what?
Oh, I hate you.
I hate you.
I don't even know why
I stay in the same room with you.
Please forgive me, but can't we be friends?
- Just friends?
- Never.
Now, look, we're gonna be related, aren't we?
And we're gonna see each other.
- How can we help it?
- I suppose we can't.
And if we meet in the future we don't have to talk about personal things... - about you and me.
Let's talk about something neutral.
- For instance, Albert.
- Why not?
By the way, do you love Albert?
I'm marrying him, am I not?
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.
No, you're not. You can't.
You haven't got the book.
- What book?
- How to Make Your Husband Happy.
Well, it might interest you to know that I went back and bought it.
Does it tell you how to make a man happy whom you don't love?
Now, look here, Cousin Henry.
Albert's a fine man.
Yes, he is.
He's good, and... - and he has integrity.
- And he's full of high ideals.
- Do you love him?
Well, I'm gonna make him a very fine wife.
At least I'm gonna try my best.
There'll never be a moment in his whole life when he'll ever regret having married me.
And if you ask me one more question, I'm gonna leave this room, and I'll never come back again.
Never!
I still can't understand it.
An angel like you and Albert.
It... - It doesn't make sense.
Why do you want to marry him?
Well, you see,
I always wanted to live in New York.
I don't want to say anything against Kansas... but life on my father's estate... -
Don't misunderstand me. We have all the modern conveniences and luxuries, but... -
Oh, and you don't know
Father and Mother.
Well, I've... - I've only just met them.
- Don't you think they're sweet?
- Well, yes. Very sweet.
Yes, they are. But it's not very easy to live with them.
You see, most of the time they don't talk to one another.
And whenever a young man... - and there were some very nice ones... -
Oh, I'm sure of it.
If one of them asked for my hand and my mother said yes, my father said no.
And when my father said yes, my mother said no.
But Albert came at one of those rare moments when they were both on speaking terms.
And if I hadn't said yes... who knows when my parents might have been talking to each other again?
I might have spent the rest of my life in Kansas.
Don't misunderstand me.
I love Kansas.
It's just that
I don't feel like living there.
Besides that...
I didn't want to be an old maid.
Not in Kansas.
Well, you're going to live right here in New York, and you don't have to marry Albert.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do. You're gonna get married, but not to Albert.
And yet you won't even have to change the initials on your linen.
- You're going to marry me.
- Oh, we can't do that.
How can I marry you?
I'm not even engaged to you.
- Martha, do you love me?
- I hardly know you.
You don't need to know anything when you love.
Love needs no introduction.
You love or you don't.
- You don't know what you're saying.
You must be out of your mind.
- Do you love me or don't you?
Trying to take away the fiancée of your own cousin, causing a family scandal.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
Oh.
Oh, why did you ever come into my life?
To make you happy.
To hold you in my arms forever.
I'll never be able to look my father in the face.
- I'll never be able to go back to Kansas again.
- Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, I wish I were dead.
Look, let's get away. Let's get married immediately.
Right away. Tonight.
- You mean elope?
- That's what I mean.
But where would we go? Oh, I never did such a thing before. I feel so helpless.
I haven't got a thing with me.
Oh, I wish I were dead.
When Romeo and Juliet ran away, they didn't stop to say good-bye.
When Leander swam the Hellespont to his beloved, he didn't bother to take a suitcase.
When Tristan falls in love with Isolde, they have to sing for three and a half hours.
All I'm asking you to do is hop into a cab and drive to the first justice of the peace.
What are we waiting for?
Was that Henry and Martha?
- What happened?
- They left in a cab. They're going to get married.
- Married?
- Married? Married?
Oh, Randolph, where does he get it from?
Now, now, Bertha.
Keep a stiff upper lip.
Sir, I am still too dazed to express myself clearly... but I assure you that the sentiments of our family are with you.
If this happened at home, my husband would jump on a horse and lasso them back.
Don't you tell me what I would do.
But there's one thing I am going to do... - disinherit her.
She'll never see another nickel of mine.
- We came here from Kansas a happy family.
- Well, anyway, a family.
- We loved our Martha.
- Don't mention her name again.
And if she comes crawling back to me on her knees... she'll find the door closed... - and don't you open it.
Please, dear family... thank you, thank you for your efforts to comfort me in my bereavement... but I feel there are others who need even more consolation than I do.
Uncle Randolph and Aunt Bertha... you will have to forget as the years pass by that you are the parents of the guilty party.
And you, Mr. and Mrs. Strable... - well, there's very little
I can say to sustain you.
And to you, Mrs. Cooper-Cooper...
I offer our deepest apology for the unfortunate interruption of your beautiful aria.
I would like to go on, but the strain is too much.
Flogdell.
- Do you know where they were going?
- No, sir.
Flogdell, we've been together for 30 years.
You've never lied to me.
Now tell me.
Do you know where they were going?
- Yes, sir.
- Get your hat and coat.
- Very well, sir.
- Get a cab and tell the driver to go like lightning.
- Very well, sir.
- I think they should have a honeymoon, don't you?
- I think so, sir.
- Then hurry, hurry, hurry!
"She was packed by E.F. Strable...
"to be served at Albert's table... but that Henry changed the label."
That's poetry.
In the next 10 years old houses were torn down.
New houses rose taller and taller.
New York was changing all over.
But our marriage had lasted
just like our two-story gray-stone house.
- Good morning, Flogdell.
- Good morning, sir.
- Oh, you're a new man, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.
- How long have you been here?
- I should say about a year, sir.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Shh! Jackie.
- Good morning, Daddy.
You know very well you're not supposed to bounce that ball until your mother is up.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- I've told you this many times.
And I'm always sorry, Daddy.
Daddy, I'll bet you'd like to know what I'm gonna give you for your birthday.
- I'm dying to know.
- It's something to wear.
- Let's see now. Uh, is it a tie?
- I'm not telling.
I'll give you a hint.
It has 22 colors in it.
No tie can have that many colors, so it can't be a tie.
It can't be, huh?
Now, I'm not saying it is a tie... but if it were a tie, there wouldn't be another one like it in the world.
- I can believe that, Jackie.
- Daddy, how old are you going to be?
- Thirty-six.
- That's pretty old, isn't it?
Uh... - Well, I never thought about it, but I guess it is.
Daddy, when you were as old as me, what kind of a kid were you?
Well, I was very obedient.
When my parents told me to go to bed,
I went without arguing.
I did my schoolwork, brushed my teeth every morning.
Gee, Daddy.
I guess you were a wonderful boy.
Well, I suppose I was.
Then old Grandpa must be a terrible liar.
Well, good-bye, Daddy.
Where does he get it from?
Good morning, Grandfather.
How are you feeling?
- That's fine. Morning, Mother.
- Good morning, Henry.
Mother, I want you to look at this.
- Do you think Martha will like it?
- Oh, it's beautiful.
After 10 years of me, she's entitled to it.
Yes. Ten years next Tuesday.
- And you'll be 36.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, if your dear father could be here and share this happiness with us.
I always thank heaven he lived long enough to see you settle down, become a fine husband... a good father and a wonderful son.
Well, it's all Martha.
And only Martha.
You know, Mother,
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Yes. She's a fine wife, and she has a good influence on you.
And she's pretty lucky herself.
Yes. Don't be a mother-in-law.
By the way, isn't she coming down to breakfast?
I didn't go into her room. The opera lasted till after midnight, so she's probably tired.
Thank you.
- Anything serious?
- No. No. Nothing.
Uh, excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Where is she?
Let me see that telegram.
It's just something personal.
It has nothing to do... -
So, you don't trust me anymore, hmm?
I'm getting too old.
Henry... you mean we've lost Martha?
It's impossible.
It's incredible.
It just doesn't make sense,
Martha leaving me.
What did you do?
What happened?
I don't know how I can go on living without her.
Grandpa, I love Martha.
I love her more than anything in the world.
I didn't ask you that.
I asked you what happened.
I don't know.
I always thought she was very happy with me.
I don't know what she's heard.
You know how people talk about anybody.
No man is perfect.
But running away like this... -
Believe me.
I... - I can't see any reason for it.
If a woman like Martha runs away from her husband, there must be a reason.
Now look here, Henry.
You were the only Van Cleve
I ever really cared about. I loved you.
You were like me... - at least I thought so.
You were all the things
I wanted to be.
You did all the things
I wanted to do and didn't.
- And now you've let me down.
- Grandpa, I can't live without her.
- What... - What am I gonna do?
- That's up to you.
But let me tell you one thing.
I'm an old man.
I might have to go any day now.
And if you can't make Martha forgive you...
I'll be waiting up there right in the entrance.
And if you ever dare to climb up that ladder...
I'll hit you on the head with a baseball bat. jasper!
- Jasper.
- Jasper! jasper. jasper.
- Yes, sir?
- Where are the funny papers?
Uh, boss, well, now, you see... -
- Get 'em, and get 'em right now!
- Yes, sir.
- Good morning, Mrs. Strable.
- Good morning, Jasper.
Uh, it's terrible bad weather we're having today.
You know, when I see it pouring like this...
I often wonder, where does it all come from?
You tell Mr. Strable he'll get the funny papers when I'm through... and not one second sooner.
Yes, ma'am.
I certainly will.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Boss...
I just had a very fine conversation with the missus... and she says if you'd just be good enough to give the matter a little patience... as soon as she finishes
The Katzenjammer Kids I think... -
I came down especially early this morning... to find out if the captain got out of the barrel!
This goes on every Sunday, and I'm not gonna stand it anymore!
- Jasper!
- Excuse me, Mr. Strable.
Yes'm?
You can tell Mr. Strable the captain got out of the barrel.
Boss! Boss!
Got good news for ya!
The captain is out!
Ain't that fine?
- Now you can have a few more cakes.
- Ah, just a couple.
I can't see how he could get out of that barrel.
Why, that barrel had wooden slats... nailed down on the top and the bottom... and there were steel bands all around it... and they left it in the middle of the desert.
Now, how could he ever get out of it?
You eat your cakes while they're nice and hot.
In the meantime,
I'll see what I can find out.
- Uh, another lamb chop, Mrs. Strable?
- I don't mind.
About that barrel, the way he got out of it was, a friendly snake came crawling... -
Don't tell me!
You know it's no fun unless I read it myself!
What are you trying to do, ruin my Sunday?
Will you tell Mr. Strable
I was talking to you? jasper... the snake came crawling along in the desert... wound itself around the barrel, and then, crunch!
I can't live in this house any longer!
- Mr. Strable.
- What do you want, Daisy?
There's a gentleman here to see you say he's from New York.
- His name is Van Cleve.
- Van Cleve?
That's the gentleman's name, yes, sir.
The nerve of him, trying to walk into this house.
- Tell him to go back where he came from.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wait a minute, Daisy.
- Yes, sir?
Maybe I ought to see Mr. Van Cleve.
And if I wanna see him, he'll come in.
And if I want him to stay here, he'll stay right here!
- Now, Daisy...
- Yes, sir? go tell that man if he's not off these premises in 10 seconds, I'll wring his neck!
Yes, sir.
I'll most certainly tell him.
- Jasper, get me some fresh hotcakes.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir, but maybe somethin' done happened to Miss Martha.
- You talk too much.
- Yes, sir.
- Jasper.
- Yes, ma'am?
Tell that man to come in.
Yes, ma'am.
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir!
Mr. Van Cleve, if you please.
How do you do?
Oh! It's the other one!
It's Albert.
Hello, Albert.
- How do you do, Mrs. Strable?
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Strable?
- Well, we haven't seen each other since... -
Not since that ill-fated occasion
10 years ago tomorrow.
- Mmm. Had breakfast?
- Yes, thank you.
- Well, sit down anyway.
- Thank you.
- Got some business in Kansas?
- No, I was on my way to California.
But I said to myself, why shouldn't I stop and pay my respects to those charming Strables?
- Well, what do you want?
- Nothing. Nothing in particular.
- Good.
- Oh, yes!
There is one bit of news.
I'll bet you can't guess whom I met accidentally on the train.
Probably not.
- How's business in New York?
- Very good.
Well, I don't want to keep you in suspense any longer.
I met your own daughter, Martha.
Don't mention her name in this house!
We don't want to hear anything more about her.
My dear friends... speaking as a jurist, may I say that even in our penal code... we have wisely provided a system of parole... and I have excellent reason to believe that the party... - whose name I, naturally, will not mention in this house... - has amply paid for her mistake.
Good.
And I am sure there is nothing she'd like better than to come back to the paternal nest.
So she wants to leave him, and now she remembers us.
Not a chance, Albert.
That's final.
Well, she's waiting in a carriage... in front of this very house.
Who?
Martha?
- Martha? Here?
- Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Strable.
Shall I bring her in?
- Well, I don't know what Mrs. Strable thinks.
- Well, I... -
- And I don't care.
- I don't care what you think.
- She might just as well come in and stay till after the rain's over.
- All right.
Oh, Martha! Martha!
Hello.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello.
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Martha.
- Welcome home, Miss Martha.
- Thank you, Jasper.
- We all missed you.
- Get outta here.
- You talk too much.
- Yes, sir.
Well, I assume there are things between daughter and parents... that are better left to the daughter and to the parents.
If you'll excuse me.
Well, I suppose it was a pretty muddy ride from the station in all that rain.
Yes, I suppose it was.
Uh, do you want some breakfast?
It's Sunday morning.
We got wheat cakes.
Thank you, Father, but I'm not hungry.
Well, the place hasn't changed much, has it?
No, it looks exactly the same.
Maybe now you'll appreciate your home.
It took you 10 years to find out that we were right.
- If you'd listened to your mother... -
- And your father, things might have been different.
- I think I'd better be going.
- Oh, you're getting touchy, huh?
Well, if anyone has a right to be angry, it's us.
But we're willing to let bygones be bygones.
After all, we're not made of stone.
If a daughter comes home and is sorry... -
I'm not sorry, and I don't want your forgiveness.
Then what did you come home for?
I came here because I felt
I wanted to see you.
- If you expect me to get down on my knees... -
- Now, now, now, now, forget it.
After all, you were young, and it probably was all the fault of that... -
Please, Father.
I don't want to hear a single unpleasant word about the last 10 years, or I'll have to go.
Martha.
You look so tired, dear.
- Well, no wonder. After all... -
- Can't you keep still?
It's all dead and buried, and let's forget it.
Come on. Let's go upstairs.
You're going to have a nice, hot bath, and then you're going to lie down and rest.
Now, how's that? Huh?
So he really got out of that barrel.
Well, what do you think of that?
Jasper! jasper!
What's all that noise about? just had a talk with Mr. Chuck.
He say somebody said they saw a couple of prowlers on the grounds.
- Maybe some of them horse thieves.
- Well, tell Chuck to keep after 'em.
- Yes, sir.
- If necessary, shoot 'em.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Father, but if you don't mind,
I think I'll go upstairs.
I'm getting pretty tired.
Good night.
- Good night, Martha.
- Good night, Mother.
Good night, dear.
Remember, breakfast at 7:30.
Yes, Mother.
Good night, Albert.
Good night, Martha.
Martha?
Well, Martha, I want you to have a restful night.
And why not?
Your troubles are actually over.
- I suppose you're right.
- I know I am.
You paid for your mistakes, and paid dearly.
Now, I don't want anybody to get the impression that I've been the victim of 10 years of misery.
Nothing of the kind.
On the contrary, I can say there were moments in my marriage... which few women have been lucky enough to have experienced.
- There were times when you were lifted way up to the sky...
- Yes, way up. only to be dropped way down afterward.
That's not the purpose of marriage.
Marriage isn't a series of thrills.
Marriage is a peaceful, well-balanced adjustment of two right-thinking people.
I'm afraid that's only too true.
Well, good night, Albert.
Uh, Martha, there's... one other thought
I want you to sleep with.
My feelings for you have remained unchanged.
That's very kind of you, Albert, and I'm touched.
Naturally, I'm not the flashy type, like some people.
I'd say I was rather on the conservative side.
If I were, for instance, a suit of clothes, you wouldn't call me a stylish cut.
And I prefer it that way.
But I can safely say
I'm made of solid material.
I'm sewed together carefully and my lining is good, Martha.
Frankly, I believe I wear well.
I'm... not too hot in the summer... and I give protection in the winter.
- Need I say more?
- No, Albert.
You've given a complete and accurate description of yourself.
- Good night.
- Thank you, Martha.
- Miss Martha?
- Yes?
Excuse me.
That horse thief we were looking for... -
- Did you catch him?
- Yes, ma'am.
- He's in your room waiting for you.
- In my r... -
- You mean... -
- Yes, miss. That's him.
Martha, darling, sweetheart... -
How could you do a thing like this to me?
Don't you realize what I went through?
- Oh, Henry... -
- Running away like that without a word!
Can't you imagine how I suffered?
How could you do this to me?
Oh, Martha, Martha.
Henry, it won't work anymore.
- What's Albert doing here?
- I met him by accident on the train.
- He was very nice to me, and... -
- Accident? You expect me to believe that?
Here I am, looking all over the world for my wife, going insane with despair.
And where do I find her? 2,000 miles away in a lonely country place with another man.
- I don't see how I can stand any more.
- Henry, it won't work.
Very well.
If it comes to the point where a woman doubts her husband's sincerity... there's nothing more to do.
Everything is over.
Good-bye, Martha.
Good-bye, Henry.
Martha, I really mean this.
I'm going.
I know you mean it, Henry.
All right. just give me five minutes to pull myself together, and you'll never see me again. Never, never.
Oh, Henry, I know your every move.
I know your outraged indignation.
I know the poor, weeping little boy.
I know the misunderstood, strong, silent man... the wounded lion who's too proud to explain what happened in the jungle last night.
So, I'm a fake.
- I'm false, I'm cheap.
- Oh, Henry, please... -
- I know I've brought you nothing but unhappiness.
- You know that's not true.
- Oh! So we had some good times together.
- Some wonderful times.
Then what do you want? What did I do?
Even a murderer has a right to defend himself.
You can't hang a man without evidence.
- I know.
If I only knew what particular thing is in your mi... -
- Have you seen Aunt Minetta recently?
- Yes, of course.
Oh, well, now everything is clear.
This is something I didn't even want to mention to you, it's so unimportant.
When she saw me, yes,
I was at the Plaza having tea... and at the table with me was a very handsome young woman, but there was nothing to it.
- I would have explained to you myself... -
- But you didn't want to make me uncomfortable.
- Even for one second.
- That's right, darling. That's exactly right.
Henry, it won't work. And besides,
Aunt Minetta didn't say one word about you.
- And as for the young lady at the Plaza... -
- Darling, I can easily explain that.
Oh, I know you can.
You're a master at that.
All right, all right.
I'm fighting a losing battle.
I don't love you. I never loved you.
I love everybody in New York more than you.
There you go again.
It's the 25th of October.
Many happy returns.
Thank you, Martha... but it's something much more important than my birthday.
It's our anniversary.
Ten years ago today, I was almost as much in love with you as I am right now.
It's very difficult for a woman to send her husband away on their 10th anniversary... especially when he speaks as beautifully as you do.
But I must do it.
All right, darling.
I know it's all over.
I'm sure you'll find someone else who will be... really worthy of you.
But let's pretend... just for a minute.
Happy anniversary.
Do you like it?
I'd say it cost at least $10,000.
For that money, it's a very good purchase.
Why, Martha, how can you talk like that?
If you'd only forgotten to give me this bracelet...
I probably would have been foolish enough to be in your arms right now.
You've no idea what a mistake you made.
The magician played one trick too many.
The other day I was having a new photograph made ofJackie and me.
I wanted to have it the right size to fit into your wallet.
So I slipped into your room.
This fell out of your wallet.
And I don't ever remember having received any bracelet from you on or about May 2.
Oh, so that's what it's all about.
And to think that you went through all this just because the jeweler made a mistake.
And that what the whole thing is... - a mistake.
Naturally, I didn't buy a bracelet for $500.
Has Cartier ever made a mistake in any of our bills before?
Darling, I love you. I think you're the most beautiful, adorable thing in all the world.
Do you really believe there's any woman good enough to take me away from you?
And if there were such a woman, do you think she'd be worth only a $500 bracelet?
- Henry, I... -
- Darling, I'll make you a bet.
If Cartier doesn't admit that this whole thing is a terrible mistake... -
- Then you won't buy there anymore.
- Henry, it won't work.
- Grandpa!
- Martha, my darling.
Come on, come on.
Let's get started. Let's pack.
- Grandpa, what do you mean?
- Naturally, you're going back with us to New York.
What are you standing there for?
You're making a pretty bad job of it.
Come on, sweep her off her feet, or we'll miss the next train.
- If I can't make her happy, then I don't want her to come back.
- Yeah, that's better.
- No, I mean this seriously.
- That's why it's good.
Look, Martha, let's face it.
- You want a divorce.
- I see no other way.
- What aboutJackie?
- Naturally, I want him.
I think you're right.
I think he should get away from me.
- I didn't mean it that way.
- But I did.
I adore the boy, and therefore
I think he shouldn't be with me.
Well, I don't think a child should be deprived of his father.
Do you want him to grow up to be another Henry Van Cleve... and on his 36th birthday make his wife as unhappy as I've made you?
- Are the rest of your things in the closet?
- Yes.
For instance, do you know what our littleJackie did the other day?
- What?
- He bought some ice cream for a little girl.
What's wrong about that?
I think it's charming.
But the girl he bought the ice cream for was not the girl he should have bought it for.
- It wasn't?
- No.
Little devil.
And when the one little girl found out that the other girl... -
Well, that boy got himself into such a mess.
Oh, if I only could have been there.
You should have seen our littleJackie trying to get himself out of that situation.
- Did he?
- Yes.
Little girl likes him better than before.
Good. What a child.
- Believe me, he is a problem.
- I suppose so.
But when he makes up his little stories... -
And you know they're just little stories, but he wants you to believe them so badly... that you wish you could... and finally what can you do but... -
Happy anniversary.
I'm still too confused.
I've got to collect myself.
- Give her time to make up her mind.
- She can do that on the train.
- But what am I going to say to my parents?
- Send 'em a telegram.
- Sneak out of the house in the middle of the night?
- Exactly.
- Like burglars?
- Like thieves.
- We did it once before.
- Why shouldn't we do it again?
- How many people are lucky enough to have the thrill of eloping twice in one marriage?
- That's it! That's it!
- How many women love their husbands enough to forgive them and start all over again?
- Good! Good!
And how many men love their wives enough to lie and say they're guilty when they've done nothing?
- Careful, Henry, careful.
- At least nothing that amounts to very much.
I wouldn't go any further into that.
We'd better get started.
I'll see if the coast is clear.
- Jasper. Jasper?
- Yes?
- Everything ready?
- Yes, sir. Right out in front.
All my life I've wanted to run away with a woman.
- Jasper, it's happening!
- Thank you, sir.
All right, come on.
- Bye, Jasper.
- Good-bye, Miss Martha. Good-bye.
Albert!
Come!
And so, farewell, dear E.F. Strable!
We'll take Martha!
You keep Mabel!
Yippee!
Then one birthday began following another...
faster and faster.
Each year there were
more and more candles...
and less and less... -
Yes, I became 45.
Then came 46...
47...
and I stopped counting.
On one of these birthdays...
Martha and I, just the two of us,
went to the Follies.
§ I'm the sheikh §
§ Of Araby §
§ Yes, indeed, he's the sheikh of Araby §
§ Your love belongs to me §
§ We're in love
We're in love, as you can see §
§ At night, when you're asleep §
§ Late at night when the moon is shining bright §
§ Into your tent I'll creep §
§ I'll be creepin' when we are asleep §
§ The stars that shine above §
§ Way up high in the sky up above §
§ Will light our way to love §
§ Will light our way to love §
§ You'll rule this land with me §
§ Oh, how happy we will always be §
§ The sheikh of Araby §§
Suddenly I noticed...
a very attractive girl
coming down the staircase.
To me she was
just another attractive girl...
but, I must admit, attractive.
Anyway, a few weeks later...
I happened to find out
that her name was Peggy Nash...
and I happened to hear things about her
which made me very eager to meet Miss Nash.
- Yes?
- A Mr. Jones to see you.
I'll be out in a minute.
- Will you come in, please, Mr. Jones?
- Thank you.
- Miss Nash will be with you in just a minute.
- Thank you.
- How do you do, Mr. Jones?
- How do you do, Miss Nash?
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Thank you so much for those beautiful, beautiful roses.
When I saw you the other evening at the Follies coming down that stairway, I said to myself... -
"That's the girl of my dreams"?
Uh, that's right.
- You see, Miss Nash... -
- Call me Peggy.
Well, this is delightful.
- Hello, Peggy.
- Hello, Jonesy.
Well, Jonesy, let me tell you, that note that came with your flowers... -
- You liked it?
- Who wouldn't?
It was so full of charm.
It was so sweet.
It had all the quaintness of bygone days.
Really?
Yes. You know, men don't write that way anymore.
Why are there so few of you left?
Miss Nash, to tell you the truth...
I didn't exactly come up here to be admired as a museum piece.
Now, Jonesy, don't be touchy.
- Yeah. Anyway, Miss Nash... -
- Peggy.
Anyway, Peggy...
I'm sure it's a waste of time to talk of the past... when the present can be so lovely that one anticipates a most delightful future.
Oh, thank you, Jonesy.
What a difference.
You know, the moment you meet somebody of today he says...
"How about it, babe?
Where do we have supper?"
The next moment, he pulls out a diamond bracelet.
And before you know it there it is on your wrist.
How crude. How crude.
Yes, very crude.
And let me tell you... a bracelet hastily presented... is usually selected hastily... whereas a bracelet chosen with care... -
- Has better stones?
- The very best.
Oh, Jonesy, Jonesy, you make it all sound so wonderful.
- But how could I explain such a gift to... -
- To whom?
Oh. Friend of yours?
Very much so.
- Serious?
- I'm afraid it is.
Is there anything I could do to make you forget this young man? jonesy, you're asking a lot. just look at him.
- He seems very young.
- Not too young.
Would it be indiscreet of me to ask who this young man is?
Come on, Mr. Van Cleve.
Don't you know your own son?
No, I didn't fall into your trap.
You know, Mr. Van Cleve, girls are awfully smart these days.
It must be rather sad for the great cavalier of the gay '90s... to find his technique is getting rusty.
Yes, I've heard all about the daring Henry.
I understand in my mother's day you were.
And I'm sure you had a very dashing figure.
And now you're a kind of, um... retired Casanova.
You know, it's always the same with men when they retire.
Some grow flowers, and, uh... some grow a tummy.
Miss Nash, my son means very much to me.
- He means very much to me too.
- How much?
Oh, yes, that's right.
Of course.
In your day girls used to wait... for the old-fashioned father to come with the big checkbook to pay off.
I'm sure that happened.
Well, that's one thing that hasn't changed.
Shall we say... 5,000?
Five thousand?
Oh, Jonesy, you underestimate me.
I'm much worse than that.
To get rid of somebody as terrible as me is worth... -
Well, I'll make you a bargain... -
All right.
I'll send you the money.
- Before lunch?
- Before lunch.
Good-bye, Miss Nash.
- You've been perfectly charming.
- And so have you.
- And you hope never to see me again.
- I wouldn't say that.
Miss Nash, now that our problem has been solved...
I would like to ask one slight question.
Not that it matters, but I'm just curious and I would appreciate an honest answer.
I give you my word.
Suppose you didn't know I was Jack's father and you happened to see me on the street... or in a restaurant.
This is just an academic question.
How old would you say I am?
Well, I'd say about 50.
- That old?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Oh, no, no. That's perfectly all right.
- Thanks very much.
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
Fifty.
No wonder you get those headaches.
Thank you, darling.
Martha, this is going to be a bit unpleasant.
I've tried to keep it from you for some time, but now I think I'd better tell you.
I know.
You don't love me anymore.
Now, darling, don't try to be funny.
It's aboutJack.
Will you please stop worrying aboutJack?
If he wants to stay out late, what of it?
If he's ever going to have any fun, now's the time. Don't spoil it.
Martha, this is serious.
Very, very serious.
I just happened to learn the boy got into the clutches of a certain girl.
I went to a great deal of trouble... -
Believe me, it wasn't easy... - but I managed to find out who the girl was.
- You mean Peggy Nash?
- Ye... -
Where did you... -
How did you know?
Oh, I forget.
Someone told me.
You go to lunch, and you hear things.
Why didn't you tell me? How can you be so placid about a thing like this?
Darling, why should I excite you?
I know you so well. Certain little things get you all worked up, and then you don't sleep.
Then you have to take a pill, and then you don't want to take a pill.
Believe me, Henry, the less attention you pay to them... -
Really, these things work themselves out.
Oh, Martha, Martha.
That is one of your greatest charms.
After almost 25 years in New York, you're still the innocent little girl from Kansas.
But, fortunately,
I have had experience with showgirls.
And it's a father's function to save his son from the mistakes he made.
If we ignore matters like this, how do you think our boy will end up? just like you... - with a girl like me.
No, darling, never.
Where would he find anybody like you?
He couldn't.
He won't be that lucky.
- Aren't you sweet.
- I have no illusions about myself.
Martha, if I hadn't met you
I hate to think where I'd be right now.
Well, probably outside some stage door... or even inside the dressing room... and having a wonderful time.
- Oh, now, darling... -
- Come on. Give me a kiss.
Don't let's worry about it anymore.
Martha, I just want to get your viewpoint.
Do you think it would be a bad idea, just to be safe, if I looked up this girl and, uh... -
And what?
Well, maybe, just to avoid complications... ask her to leave the boy alone and, if necessary, buy her off.
Now, Henry, don't even consider anything as foolish as that.
All right, all right, all right.
It was just a thought.
- If you want me to, I'll drop it.
- Good.
How much did you pay the girl?
Why, what do you mean?
Don't I know my Henry and his innocent eyes?
I beg your pardon, sir, but you've told me to let you know when Mr. Jack arrived, sir.
- He's just come in, sir.
- Thank you.
Mmm.
You see? He's home early for the first time in weeks, and I'll tell you why.
He went to the theater as usual, and she gave him his walking papers.
- And the poor boy is probably all upset.
- I hope he is.
And, Martha, don't you baby him.
Don't you spoil what I've done.
- Hello.
- Hello, Jack.
Hello, Mother.
Hello, Father.
- How are you, Jack?
- Fine.
- You look a little depressed.
- Who, me? I never felt better in all my life.
Besides that, I could use $100.
A hundred dollars?
What for?
Well, I wanna throw a little party tonight, take someone out.
Oh. I see.
Tell me, whom are you going around with these days, Jack?
Now, Martha, that's Jack's personal life and we shouldn't pry into it.
Here you are, Jack.
There's your hundred dollars.
- Thanks, Father.
- Have a good time.
- Thanks.
- I'm not interested in whom you're taking out.
I'm sure she's all right.
Anyway, it's none of our business whether you're taking out MaryJones...
Helen Smith, Mitzi Glutz... or Peggy Nash.
Peggy Nash?
Father, what is this? Are you trailing me?
Where'd you hear that name?
I don't know.
Martha, where did we hear that name?
I don't know.
And don't ask me.
Well, uh, uh, one has friends... and, yes, one goes to lunch an... -
Tell me, isn't she a Follies girl famous for coming down a staircase?
- Look, we're all grown up, aren't we?
- Why, certainly.
- Well, I had a crush on her.
- Ah, and why not?
- Why shouldn't he?
- I don't know. And don't ask me.
I, uh... - I understand she's a very attractive girl.
Oh, she is, and I took her pretty seriously.
- Oh, you did, huh?
- Yes, very.
- And then after a little time...
- Yes?
- I got tired of her.
- Oh.
Oh, you did, huh?
So then I faced the problem of how to get rid of her.
- Things like that aren't easy.
- I should say not.
- Don't ask me.
- I didn't ask you. I merely made a statement.
- Go on, Jack.
- After all, what could she do to me?
I hadn't promised her anything.
- You hadn't?
- I should say not.
I wasn't the first romance in her life.
You know, I'm no baby.
But nevertheless, you went there expecting a lot of trouble, didn't you?
Yes, but to my surprise, she was so big about the whole thing... and let me off so easily.
Oh, she did, eh?
Well, isn't that fortunate.
Yes.
She was so wonderful about the whole thing,
I almost fell in love with her again.
Y... - Oh.
Oh, but it's all over now, and I'm glad of it.
- And so am I.
- And so am I.
As a matter of fact,
I never was happier in my life.
And while we're on the subject, Jack,
I think you're getting to the age... where you should start to look around for a really nice girl.
Oh, I don't have to look around.
I've met her already.
- You have?
- A wonderful girl.
- The most wonderful girl I ever met in my life.
- Really! Well, isn't that nice.
Tell me, who is the young lady?
Is she someone I might know?
A New York girl, perhaps?
Oh, no.
She comes from Philadelphia.
Oh! From Philadelphia.
Somehow Philadelphia always sounds right, doesn't it, Martha?
- Yes, it does. Tell us who she is.
- Yes, tell us.
Well, have you been to
Earl Carroll's Vanities?
You mean this girl comes down a staircase too?
I should say not.
Not this girl.
This one slides down the bannister, falls in the orchestra... and lands... - bang... - right on the big drum.
Oh, you'll be crazy about her.
See you tomorrow.
I have to run along.
What's the matter with that boy?
He's young, Henry.
That's all.
Come on, dear.
It's time to go to bed.
Martha, I want to ask you something.
And don't spare my feelings.
Be absolutely frank.
I always am.
If you didn't know me and you saw me for the first time... on the street or in a restaurant... -
Martha, do you think
I'm getting a little heavy?
Don't let that worry you.
As a matter of fact, I like it.
Let me tell you something.
Nearly 15 years ago, when you and Grandfather brought me back from Kansas...
I still didn't feel that you really belonged to me, and only to me.
I can't put my finger on anything definite... but still, whenever I wasn't with you
I was always a little uncertain... and nervous about my little Casanova.
And then... one day I noticed that you began to have a little... -
Well, just a little tummy.
Then I knew I was safe.
From that moment on I knew that you were really mine, that you'd settle down.
Now go to bed, darling.
You've had a hard day.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
Yes, we were married 25 years.
We were celebrating
our silver wedding anniversary.
- Have you seen Mrs. Van Cleve?
- No, sir. I've been in the kitchen.
- Jack, is your mother upstairs?
- No. I haven't seen her.
Darling.
What are you doing in here all alone?
Nothing.
I just want to take a little rest.
- After all, it's been such an exciting evening.
- Nothing wrong, is there?
- No, nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, dear.
- You're feeling all right, aren't you?
- Of course, darling. I'm just... -
- Just what?
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was being a little sentimental... so I came in here for a few minutes.
Ah.
Yes.
This is where it all started.
Twenty-five years ago.
I was... -
Yes, I was standing over there by that desk.
No, you were sitting in a chair.
Yes. You're right.
And then you came in and you stood by the desk.
Then suddenly you started walking toward me... very slowly, very slowly.
I could count every step.
Oh, you were such a frightened little girl.
The closer I came, the more frightened you were.
Darling, I want to make a confession.
- After all, we've been married 25 years.
- What is it?
I wasn't frightened at all.
- You weren't?
- Not at all.
And when you were walking toward me so very slowly, do you know what was in my mind?
- No.
- I thought, What's the matter with him?
Can't he walk faster?
- And then I ran out into the hall.
- But you came back.
- Only because I had to sneeze.
- Mm-hmm.
I beg your pardon, madam.
You are wanted on the telephone.
Oh.
Hello?
Yes, I called you.
Well, it's really not important.
Yes, everything is all right now.
I'll call you soon.
All right, tomorrow.
- Who was that?
- Oh, nothing special.
- Let's go back to our guests, shall we?
- Darling, who was that on the phone?
- I'll tell you all about it some other time.
- Why not now?
- Our guests will be wondering where we are.
- Now, Martha, who was that?
All right, I'll tell you.
It's another confession.
- My lover.
- I don't think that's funny at all.
- Are you jealous?
- Oh, don't be silly, Martha.
But why can't you tell your husband whom you talk to over the telephone?
Besides, I wouldn't have brought it up right now, but just the same... for the past several weeks you've been going out in the afternoons... and you've always managed to avoid telling me where you were.
You are jealous!
Henry, at last, after 25 years!
- Thank you, darling.
- Martha, whom did you talk to?
Darling, don't be a baby. What dashing young cavalier would be pursuing me?
Plenty. You're still very attractive, and... - and you know it.
Henry...
I don't think you realize how sweet you're being at this moment.
No husband could have said anything lovelier to his wife on their 25th anniversary.
Imagine if, 25 years ago,
I hadn't sneezed.
I wouldn't be the happiest woman in the world right now.
- Are you?
- Yes, Henry.
- Now, who was it?
- I'll tell you tomorrow.
I am not going to leave this room until you tell me.
Well, knowing my obstinate little boy... -
You promise to be sensible and not make a mountain out of a molehill?
- I promise. Now... -
- Well, you know how women are.
We have too much time on our hands, and we begin to imagine there are things wrong with us.
And I'm no exception, so I've been going to a doctor, that's all.
Darling, I feel like a fool.
Now I have a confession I must make to you... -
I really was jealous.
Martha. What did you go to the doctor for?
What's wrong?
- Nothing, really.
- So that's why you came in this room.
- You weren't feeling well. Darling, is it serious?
- I tell you, it's nothing at all.
- Just a little dizzy spell.
- Darling... -
Now, you promised to be sensible.
Come on, let's dance.
Martha, what did the doctor say?
Listen, dear, if I take five drops three times a day... and if you don't worry about me too much... we'll both live to celebrate our golden anniversary.
Now, come on. Let's dance.
I didn't know it then...
but this was our last anniversary.
It was the last time we danced together.
There were only a few more months
left for Martha...
and she made them the happiest
of our lives together.
Sixty. Yes, I was 60.
Jack insisted on celebrating.
And here are my relatives
who came to make this birthday...
an occasion of riotous gaiety.
Cousin William... - 73.
Aunt Minnie,
who admitted to 81.
The total age
of this scintillating assemblage...
was over 1,400 years.
I believeJack gave this party
on purpose...
to remind me that I was contributing
60 years to that 1,400.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ralston.
- Is Mr. Van Cleve down yet?
- He's having his breakfast.
Oh. Thank you.
- Good morning, Mr. Van Cleve.
- Good morning, Miss Ralston.
Sorry to get you up so early, but I want these two letters to leave on the 9:30 plane.
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.
When you get back to the office, please see that I get a complete domestic report... from every department before noon because I may go to Chicago.
Very well.
Now, uh, there's just one little thing.
It's, uh... - Well, a letter came in from your father addressed to the board of directors, and... -
Is he trying to go over my head again?
- Oh, I'm sure he didn't mean it that way.
- What does he want?
We live together in the same house, and then he writes letters to the board of directors.
What's the old gentleman trying to put over this time?
He wants the board of directors to vote him a bonus.
- A bonus?
- He talked to me yesterday, confidentially.
In case that bonus doesn't go through... he wanted me to persuade you to give him at least an advance on his monthly check.
He shouldn't go to you, Miss Ralston.
Well, I'm gonna give him a lesson.
And, Miss Ralston, if my father
ever talks to you again...
tell him he ought to be ashamed and that
you are in no position to deliver any messages.
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.
- Why, Mr. Van Cleve... -
- Shh!
- Is he in a bad mood?
- Terrible.
Now, look here, Miss Ralston, would you do me a very great favor?
- Father!
- Ohh.
- Good morning, Jack.
- Good morning.
I'd like to talk to you.
Father.
I heard a very funny story. You'll love it.
It'll start your day off with a laugh.
You ought to be ashamed, coming home at all hours, making a wreck of yourself.
How much longer do you think you can keep this up?
- Please, Jack, don't scold me.
- Someday you're gonna collapse.
- Do I look that bad?
- You look like a ghost.
I know you're right, Jack.
I know I should change my way of living.
But, my boy, put yourself in my position.
I'm lonesome.
You're always away somewhere on business.
Being alone in this big house night after night, you don't know what it's like.
Neither do you because you're never at home.
But I can imagine what it's like, and, Jack, it's horrible.
Now, my boy, I want to talk to you.
I'm not fooling myself.
I'm not getting any younger.
I think the time has come for me to change my way of living.
You know, Jack, when a man gets to be... - gets to be 60... the blood doesn't flow as fast anymore.
Instead of a wild mountain stream, it becomes a quiet little brook.
The other day, when I was sitting here all alone, you know what I felt like doing?
- What?
- I felt like I wanted to sit... in a nice, comfortable chair... and read and read and read.
Well, why didn't you? The library is full of books, and I'm sure you haven't read one of them. jack, the eyes can't take it anymore.
Why don't you go to an oculist?
Uh, yes... that might do.
Yes, that might do.
But, uh... on the other hand... what do you think of the idea of having, well, some kind of reader?
You know, someone with a pleasant voice, nice diction.
I know just what you want. You mean one of those nice, quiet fellows from Yale or Harvard.
Oh, they're easy to get.
- Now, who is she?
- Jack, you have the most suspicious mind.
Come on.
How old is she?
Well, uh, she's an unusually adult young woman.
I met her at old Wilson Weatherby's.
She was his reader.
Hmm. The whole thing sounds a little fishy to me.
Now, Jack, why do you want to deprive your old father of a little cultural pleasure?
I can think of nothing more dignified and homelike... than sitting in front of a fireplace and having someone read a fine book to me.
Something worthwhile.
Something... -
Father, her last thought was that you should be happy.
I promised her I'd see to it.
So, if you want this young lady to read to you, go ahead with my blessing.
No, I couldn't do it.
When a man gets to be 60, his life... -
Isn't over, Father.
Doesn't have to be over.
If a man is lonely and he feels that he needs, well... -
You mean, the feminine touch?
That's natural.
But I think he should find someone closer to his own age.
Maybe.
Not a girl of, uh... -
Twenty-four.
Well, that is a little out of proportion.
I'm afraid so.
But if, on the other hand, he should meet a cultured woman of... -
Right.
Someone with real dignity?
A woman of about 50 or 51.
Or 52 or 53, or even 55.
That's more like it. jack, my future looks pretty depressing.
Mr. Van Cleve, you're wanted on the telephone, sir.
Hello.
What?
Oh, uh, just a moment.
It's for you, "poochie."
As a man grows older,
his medicine cabinet grows bigger.
This is me at 70.
Now, really, there's nothing to worry about.
But, Mrs. Van Cleve, please... -
I know, but it was his 70th birthday yesterday... and I didn't have the heart to keep him from celebrating a little.
I hate to go to that banquet and leave the old man alone.
- I'd just as soon stay home.
- No, it's perfectly all right for you to go.
In fact, the fewer people around him, the better off he'll be.
Now, Mr. Van Cleve, I'm sorry to wake you up, but it has to be done.
Oh, if I could just... -
- Now, open your mouth, please.
- Oh, go away. Go away and leave me alone.
What was that dream all about?
Oh, I was having such a good time.
- Just open your mouth.
- What was that all about?
Oh, yes.
The door opened and a man stepped out of a rowboat.
He said, "Henry...
I've come to take you on a trip from which you'll never come back."
Now, please, don't get excited.
And I said, "My good fellow...
"if I ever take a trip like that, it'll be in a deluxe cabin... and not in a dinky little rowboat that doesn't even have a bar."
So I threw him out, rowboat and all.
Good. Good.
And what do you think he did?
He came back with a big luxury liner... floating on an ocean of whiskey and soda.
And instead of funnels... there were big, black cigars.
And on top of the bar, sitting in a lifeboat... was the most beautiful blonde... wearing a Merry Widow costume.
She dived into the whiskey and swam right over to my bedside.
"Henry," she said...
"how about a little dance?"
And the man from the boat took an accordion out of his pocket... and he played...
"The Merry Widow Waltz."
The girl held her arms out to me... and she started to dance.
Well... with him playing and her dancing... and me up to my neck in whiskey anyhow... well, I put my arms around that beautiful girl... and was just about to dance with her... when, of all people, you cut in.
You. Yes, you.
- Just open your mouth.
- Go away, and take that thermometer with you.
- The night nurse has just arrived.
- All right.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
- First door to the right.
- Thank you.
I'd fallen asleep... and suddenly I was awakened by a caressing touch on my forehead.
I opened my eyes and there she was, sitting right on the edge of the bed.
Nellie Brown, Registered Nurse.
Your Excellency... one look at her and it didn't matter whether she was registered or not.
Then she took out a thermometer... and she said, "Open your mouth."
Who wouldn't for Nellie?
And then she put the thermometer in... and my temperature went up to 110.
Who could ask for a more beautiful death?
Your Excellency, that's the story of my life... and I'd be grateful if you'd push the button and have it over with.
No.
Definitely no.
I hope you will not consider me inhospitable if I say... sorry, Mr. Van Cleve, but we don't cater to your class of people here.
Please make your reservation somewhere else.
Somewhere else?
But, Your Excellency, if I walk into the lobby of the other place... -
You mean, above?
Yes.
I know what will happen.
They might not even let me register.
The doorman might not even let me in.
Well, you never can tell.
It's worth trying.
Sometimes they have a small room vacant in the annex.
Not exactly on the sunny side... and not so very comfortable.
The bed may be hard... and you might have to wait a few hundred years until they move you into the main building.
Well, it doesn't hurt to try.
After all, they may inquire about you among the residents in the main building.
I think you'll find a lot of people who will give you a good reference, and that always helps.
For instance, there were... several young ladies.
- What about them?
- Well, some of them might be there.
And so far as I can see, you've made them all very happy.
Oh.
I'm sure they'd like to see you happy too.
And your grandfather.
Oh, yes. Grandfather.
Don't you think he'll be waiting for you?
- He might.
- He will.
- And not with a baseball bat.
- Hmm.
And if they all should fail, there's still someone else.
Yes.
She's up there.
And she will plead for you.
Do you think so?
You know she will.
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve...
I would say you have a chance... - a very good chance.
Anyway, it's worth trying.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Your Excellency.
- And thank you.
- Good luck.
I'll need it.
Down?
No.
Up.
Lawrence Stewart Talbot, who died at the youthful age of 31.
R.I.P.
That's it.
Give me the chisel.
Suppose they didn't bury him with the money on him.
Everybody in the village knows about it... his gold watch and ring and money in his pockets.
It's a sin to bury good money when it could help people.
This gives me the creeps.
What do you think it will look like after so many years?
Just bones and an empty skull.
Watch the lamp.
Get me the light.
Wolfbane.
Wolfbane?
Yes.
Even a man who is pure at heart... and says his prayers by night... may become a wolf... when the wolfbane blooms... and the moon is full and bright.
It looks like he's asleep.
Let's get on with it.
First the ring.
We won't have to worry for a long time. I thought the dead was stiff.
Shut up.
Gold.
It's holding me.
Help me.
Help me.
Alive.
Help, help!
Don't leave me!
Here, now.
Come up.
Come on. Wake up and get along with you.
You've got a home, haven't you?
Or do you want me to take you to the station?
Good heavens!
How is the patient, Nurse?
He's conscious, Dr. Mannering.
And talked. He insists upon sitting up.
Conscious? Talked?
But that's impossible so soon after a critical operation.
The nurse tells me you're well enough to talk.
Why, yes.
Pulse, 72, no fever.
There's no pain?
No.
Where am I?
Queen's Hospital.
Queens? Yes, Queen's
Hospital in Cardiff.
Wh...
How did I get here?
You were found in the street more dead than alive with a head injury.
How did you get that skull fracture?
I... don't remember.
This is Inspector Owen.
I'm Dr. Mannering.
What's your name?
Lawrence Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot.
Where did you come from?
Llanwelly Village.
But... how did I get to Cardiff?
That's enough for now.
You must rest.
You'll be fit again very soon.
If there's any change, call me immediately.
Yes, Doctor.
Hello? Put me through to the police station at Llanwelly.
Just a routine checkup, Doctor.
Then we can close the case.
Llanwelly Police Station.
This is Inspector Owen speaking, from Cardiff.
Have you got anything in your file on a man named...
Lawrence Talbot?
Why, of course.
He lived here.
Good. That's all right, then. We've got him up here in our hospital.
Huh. I wouldn't want him in our hospital.
He died four years ago.
Why, of course I'm sure,
Inspector.
I was present at his funeral.
That'll be all,
Inspector. Good-bye.
Lawrence Talbot died four years ago. Your man's an impostor.
That's a harsh word, Inspector.
Poor devil of unsound mind.
I'll wager he's sound enough to remember his own name.
I'm gonna have another talk with him.
Inspector.
Yeah?
That man is my patient, not your prisoner.
I'll decide when he can be questioned again.
Very well.
It's in your hands.
I found this bandage here when I came in this morning.
I didn't open the window.
The patient must've done it himself.
You'd better cover him up.
You're all right.
Nothing has happened.
Better get some more bandages.
We'll renew the compress.
Now, don't excite yourself.
Please be calm.
Doctor... something terrible has happened.
You must've had a nightmare. It's evident you were walking in your sleep.
Call the police.
The police? Yes, you'd better call them.
I'm a...
I'm a murderer.
Yes, of course.
Anything you say.
Ask Inspector Owen to come here at once. Yes, Doctor.
What is all this about wanting the police?
Last night, I...
I killed someone.
But you were in this room all night.
I tell you, I did it.
I killed someone.
But you couldn't have.
You must've heard the nurses discussing it.
Mr. Talbot, you're suffering from a delusion.
It's true someone was killed last night, but it happened many streets from here.
Moreover, he was attacked by some sort of wild animal.
That's just it.
I turn into an animal.
Well, Mr. Talbot.
Decided to remember your real name?
Mr. Talbot seems to have heard about the unfortunate constable last night.
It's disturbing him. But he doesn't understand.
There's a curse upon me.
I change into a wolf.
It's a bit difficult to believe, my good man.
See that scar?
That's where I was bitten by a wolf.
Only it wasn't a real wolf.
It was a man.
A werewolf.
I killed him.
Now I change into a wolf at night when the moon is full.
Hmph.
It's the truth.
Ask Maleva, the old
Gypsy woman. She knows.
Maleva? Gypsy?
Hmph.
Mr. Talbot, you must get back into bed.
Oh, are you blind? Won't you believe me? Help me.
Just tell us your real name.
Let us do the worrying.
I told you.
Lawrence Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot!
Why can't you understand?
Lawrence Talbot died four years ago.
Died?
Four years?
Well, I did...
Ohh.
I can't die.
Mr. Talbot, if you want us to help you, you must do as we say.
Now, please lie down.
You think I'm insane.
You think I don't know what I'm talking about.
Well, you just look inside that grave where
Lawrence Talbot is supposed to be buried, and see if you find a body in it.
Please get back into bed. Get on with it.
You're treating me like a lunatic.
Well, you're as stupid as all the rest.
Come along, Inspector.
You mean to say that Talbot actually experienced that murder last night?
I'm afraid so.
People with brain injuries sometimes develop supernormal mental powers... that are quite extraordinary.
Certainly he got up and opened the window.
The borderline between delusion and reality is very narrow.
Sometimes a patient may unknowingly overstep that line.
Then that man's dangerous.
He ought to be behind bars.
He's a lycanthrope.
A what?
Lycanthrope.
Oh.
What's that?
A man who imagines himself to be a wolf.
Oh.
Poor devil.
We should try to do something to help him.
Well, Doctor, I think I'll run up to Llanwelly and find out...
You know, Inspector,
I had the very same idea.
To be able to cure this man,
I have to know who he is.
Right.
We'll go up together.
Somebody's broken into this vault.
How long since you were here last, Sergeant?
Not for months. Nobody's died in Llanwelly lately, and nobody comes here if he doesn't have to.
Hmm.
The door...
What about it?
It's broken from inside.
Here, give me that.
Someone must've taken the body out of the tomb.
That's not Lawrence Talbot. Not Talbot?
Do you know who this is here? Yes. That's FreddyJolly.
Who's he?
Been up for vagrancy.
Hmm.
What would you say he died of, Doctor?
Severed jugular.
This man bled to death.
Same as the constable in Cardiff.
Looks rather like the bite of an animal. Aye, that animal.
We remember it well hereabouts.
And it must've carried away the corpse of poor Sir Lawrence.
What animal? Why, didn't you know, sir?
There was a wild animal around here a few years ago.
It killed people. Bit through their throats, drained their blood.
Did they kill it? SirJohn
Talbot thought he did, sir.
He attacked it in the dark one night, or so he thought.
But it was his son he killed. Poor Mr. Larry.
Where is
SirJohn Talbot now?
Over there, sir. Died of grief shortly after.
Let's get out of here.
But the body, sir.
Mustn't touch that.
That's evidence. Yes, sir.
Sergeant, if it's convenient, I'd like to see a photograph of Lawrence Talbot.
There's one up in my office, sir. Good.
Here's Mr. Larry's photograph, sir.
Take a look at this face, Doctor.
Isn't that our man in Cardiff?
Yes. There is a similarity. But I wouldn't swear it's the same man.
Of course it's not the same man.
If it were,
I'd be off me top.
I think the sergeant here better come back to Cardiff with us... and see if he can positively identify this man.
That's the thing to do. Do you mind if I use your telephone?
I'd like to check up on my patient's condition. Of course, Doctor. Over there.
Hello? Put me through to the
Queen's Hospital in Cardiff, please.
I want to talk to
Dr. Gordon.
Have you ever heard of a Gypsy woman named Maleva?
A Gypsy woman?
A vagrant, eh?
Mm-hmm. We always register them.
Hello, Dr. Gordon?
This is Dr. Mannering speaking.
How's Lawrence Talbot doing?
You know, the head-injury case that went violent yesterday.
Did you notify the police?
Well, I suppose that's all we can do at present.
I'll be back tonight, Doctor.
Good-bye.
What happened to Talbot?
Did he die?
No, he tore off his straightjacket during the night and escaped.
Tore off his straightjacket?
How?
Bit right through it.
Tore it to shreds with his teeth.
With his teeth?
Bruno!
Stop it!
What do you want here?
I'm looking for an old Gypsy woman.
Maleva is her name.
Is she here with you?
Maleva? Yeah, she is with us.
You'll find her over there.
Maleva!
They told me you'd left England.
I've looked all over Europe for you, from town to town.
Now that I've found you, you must help me.
Come in.
What do you want from me?
Maleva, here I still carry the sign of the pentagram.
The mark of the werewolf.
I kill people.
When the moon is full,
I turn into a wolf.
It's not in my power to help you.
You're the only one that understands.
Nobody else in the world will believe me.
But you... you know.
Your own son Bela was a werewolf.
He attacked me. He changed me into a werewolf.
He's the one that put this curse on me.
You watched over him until he was permitted to die.
Well, now I want to die too.
Won't you show me the way? I can't.
But I will guard you and take care of you... as I took care of my own son.
You're not leaving us.
You're not going with him.
He has the sign of the beast on him.
He is dangerous only when the moon is full.
I shall watch over him.
He will murder you.
No. I shall take him to a place I know.
Where?
I know a man... who has the power to help you.
Help me?
Who?
Is that the town?
Yes, that is Vasaria.
At last.
Stop.
Ooh.
Let's ask in here.
Are you the proprietor? I am.
What do you beggars want?
Wejust want to ask you, sir,
about the Doctor Frankenstein.
Frankenstein? Don't mention that name around this town.
Oh, please, won't you tell us where he lives?
There.
That's his burial place.
The fire destroyed him and all his misdeeds.
He's dead?
Oh, but he can't be.
He didn't die any too soon for us.
We all wish that he'd never been born.
What did you want with him?
I heard he was a great doctor... who could help people that other doctors couldn't cure.
Him? Murder and crimes was all he ever brought us.
He harbored a monster in his house,
a thing created by black magic.
Dr. Frankenstein, dead.
Come.
Thank you, sir, for the information.
Come on.
Get out and stay out.
We don't want your kind around here.
Oh, keep your hands off of me!
Now I must go on living.
There's no hope for me to die.
Wait! Stop!
Don't go!
Wait!
Don't go!
Don't!
Who could've done this terrible thing?
Could it be the monster again?
Frankenstein's monster?
No. The monster was burned to death by Dr. Frankenstein.
Yes, we found his bones and buried them.
How do you know they were the monster's bones?
She wasn't killed by a monster.
An animal bit her to death.
I saw the wound on her throat.
What animals are around here that can kill people?
A wolf.
Yes, a wolf.
That's his cry. Come on. Let's get him.
Come on!
Come on!
There he is!
Where is he?
He was here a moment ago.
The Gypsy woman! What are you doing here?
Come on.
Speak up, old witch.
Where's that strange man that was with you?
Let's take her back to town.
We'll make her speak.
Dr. Frankenstein must've kept records.
A diary.
You know where it is.
Show me.
It isn't here.
"To my dear father".
Then... she's the one... that can tell me.
And this man, he wishes to buy the ruins of my father's estate?
Yes. That's why I asked you to come here, Baroness.
He wanted me to give him your address.
Naturally,
I refused.
But since I knew you were anxious to get rid of the property, and all the memories connected with it,
I thought that in my position as mayor...
I would take the liberty of sending for you.
- Did he say his name is Taylor?
- Yes.
And that's all
I know about him.
Baroness Frankenstein,
Mr. Taylor.
- Baroness.
- Mr. Taylor.
Come in, Mr. Taylor.
Come in, come in.
Do you mind if I speak to the baroness alone, please?
Why, uh... Why, uh, certainly, certainly.
Now, uh, if, uh...
If you need a witness for the contract, Baroness, I'm at your service.
Thank you.
Won't you please sit down, Mr. Taylor?
Thank you.
I understand that you want to buy our land.
No, I...
I wanted to meet you.
I don't understand. I didn't know how to find you, and the mayor wouldn't give me your address, so I felt that if I offered to buy your land... that you'd be sure to come.
It's certainly a most unusual way to make an acquaintance.
But now that you have gone to all this trouble to meet me, what can I really do for you?
I want your father's records.
His experiments with life and death.
The records of the creation of the monster.
My father's diary.
Yes. You must give it to me.
I don't have any records.
If I had, I...
I would have destroyed them long ago.
My father was a great scientist, but all he created brought unhappiness, terror.
Oh, but you don't understand.
I must have them.
Won't you help me?
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor.
There is nothing I can do.
The house burned down, and I have never set a foot on that ground again... and never shall.
And that's all the information I can give you.
Well, is everything settled, Baroness?
No.
We decided not to go through with the sale after all.
Why, that sounds like...
Yes, Baroness.
It's the Festival of New Wine.
It begins tonight.
It's beautiful.
Takes me back to my childhood.
Why don't you join us tonight,
Baroness, as our guest of honor?
You would take the first train in the morning.
Thank you, Mayor.
Of course I'll stay.
You, too, Mr. Taylor. I hope you will accept the invitation... to be our guest tonight, on behalf of our community.
Thank you.
I'll be there.
Eternally! I don't want to live eternally!
Stay away!
Go away, all of you!
Let me alone.!
Stay away!
Good evening,
Mr. Talbot.
I beg your pardon.
You must be mistaken. My name is Taylor. I know you by Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot. You carry your identification on your forehead.
Baroness Frankenstein,
Dr. Mannering.
How do you do,
Dr. Mannering?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
How does it happen that you're here, Doctor?
I've been looking for you, Mr. Talbot.
And you were very easy to find.
The newspapers told me where to look for you.
Fontainbleu, Aachen,
Elrad, and finally Vasaria.
I simply followed the trail and found you.
Very clever of you, wasn't it, Doctor?
Mr. Talbot is returning to England with me.
I don't think that I care to do that, Doctor.
Baroness, will you give me the honor of the next dance?
Of course.
At our Festival of New Wine, gentlemen, it's a man's privilege to ask any lady for a dance.
And vice-versa.
Excuse us.
Why have you followed me?
Talbot, you're a murderer.
Prove it. You're insane at times, and you know it.
You're sane enough now, though, to know what you're doing.
Why don't you let me take care of you?
Do you think it would do any good to put me in a lunatic asylum?
You know that's where you belong. It's the only thing to do.
That wouldn't do any good. I'd only escape again, sooner or later.
We might be able to cure you. Might prevent you...
I only want to die.
That's why I'm here.
If I ever find peace,
I'll find it here.
You understand.
Why don't you help me?
Sit down.
How can I help you?
Dr. Frankenstein left a diary.
In it are his records of the secrets of life and death.
If I can find
Dr. Frankenstein's diary,
I can break this curse and find peace in death.
That's morbid.
Besides,
Dr. Frankenstein's experiments were considered rather extraordinary.
Medical science never, never recognized them.
That's just it. Why don't you ask that girl, his daughter?
She can tell you about things Dr. Frankenstein did... that your medical science has never heard of.
Talbot, I'm appealing to your better nature... while you can still think normally.
The moon will be full again soon. You must come back with me while there's still time.
Isn't there somebody that could understand?
Gentlemen, why those serious faces?
The monster.! The monster.!
The monster.!
No. No, it's me.
Come on with me.
Well?
Not a sign of them. We shall have to wait until morning.
It's clear to me they're hiding in those ruins.
Much as I'd like to kill the monster, I'd hate to crawl around... through the dark catacombs of Frankenstein's castle in the black of the night.
What about that Frankenstein girl? She has lived up there.
Let's bring her in here.
Stop, stop.
There's no need for us all to storm after her.
She'll come in if I ask her.
Why should we treat her so fancy? She's a Frankenstein.
Wait, wait, wait.
She's a young woman who's done us no harm.
Now, stay here.
Uh, the men would like to talk to you, Baroness.
The Gypsy woman is still locked up in the prison.
Let's find out what she knows about all of this.
There's the daughter of the accursed Frankenstein.
That name has brought nothing but misery and misfortune to our village.
We want an end of it, do you hear? Tonight.
Now listen to me.
The baroness and I want nothing but to help you.
I tell you, he's lying.
I heard him this evening...
talking to that stranger about insanity and murder.
I heard it with my own ears. Don't get excited. You won't get anywhere by raving.
Dr. Mannering is right. To find and destroy the monster, we must have a plan.
We know that it's hiding in the Frankenstein ruins.
I can lead you there, if you want me to.
I know those cellars well.
Don't trust her! Don't let them fool you! They're all in this together!
Here she is.
And the Gypsy too.
She's one of your gang of murderers. You know these people?
Speak up, old witch.
I never saw them before.
What's your name?
Maleva.
Maleva?
See? He knows her. Why don't you arrest them, all of them?
Lock up these murderers. As long as
I'm mayor, justice shall be preserved.
I shall decide what is to be done in this village.
Haven't we tried before to get rid of the monster by force?
We burned down the sanitarium, and yet we didn't destroy
Frankenstein's fiendish creation.
We must be more clever this time.
Let's use our brains for once.
Whose brains? Yours? I'd rather depend on my fists.
There's no use in storming the ruins.
We must pretend to be friends with the monster.
Yes. Why not elect it mayor of Vasaria?
This monster was created artificially.
It must be destroyed by the same means.
I'll take you to the ruins now.
I'll go with you, of course.
I promise you, if you'll help me, I'll rid Vasaria of this curse once and for all.
Talbot!
Talbot!
Talbot, where are you?
Talbot, we're your friends.
They must be there.
I saw the smoke.
- What do you want?
- We have come to help you.
What do you mean?
You wanted to find my father's diary.
Yes, of course. I'll show you where it is hidden.
She speaks the truth, my son.
L... I guess
I'll have to trust you.
Steady.
They're friends.
This is Dr. Mannering.
He's come to help you, to make you well.
Yes, that's why I'm here.
Dr. Mannering.
But the diary... You said you knew where your father hid it.
Yes.
It isn't in there.
I know.
Please.
The Secret of Life and Death.
"Matter ages because it loses energy.
"This artificial body
I have created...
"has been charged with superhuman power...
"so that its span of life will be extended.
"Its lifetime will equal the lives of more than a hundred human beings.
"This, my creation, can never perish, unless...
"unless its energies are drained off artificially... by changing the poles from plus to minus".
But that's the secret of life.
What good does it do me?
I'm not interested in life.
I wasn't created artificially.
I'm a human being. I've got real blood in my veins.
What can we do to end my life?
"Energy which cannot be destroyed can be transmitted".
Well, if that's the case, then the energies from my body can be drained off also.
Dr. Frankenstein must've... performed his experiments in this room.
With these machines.
The don't seem to have been destroyed by the fire.
You must fix them...
and help me be rid of this thing that keeps me alive eternally.
When you were talking to the monster,
I was afraid you meant what you said.
What did I say?
You said you'd help him.
Of course I can't.
I mustn't.
It shouldn't be difficult to connect these wires again.
Yes, I'll need these machines.
I believe they can be repaired again.
Machines, day after day.!
What does Mannering need machines for?
Remember Dr. Frankenstein?
He ordered machines too.
I tell you, that English doctor's no better than Frankenstein himself.
Ho, hum. Always grumbling,
Vazek. Always complaining.
We've got to trust the doctor. What else can we do?
But doesn't it strike you as strange that
Mannering and that Frankenstein girl... never tell us what they're doing up there?
If it wasn't for that old Gypsy witch... driving her wagon down to buy their provisions, we'd never see any of them.
I think we ought to go up there and see for ourselves. Right.
Oh, they're not hurting us. It's none of our affair what goes on there.
Do you want to wait for disaster to strike at us again?
I'll tell you what we ought to do.
Here are the ruins.
In here are all of them.
Here runs the underground stream that drives the turbines that Frankenstein installed.
But the water comes from up here... to the dam below.
Blow up that dam and they'll all drown like rats.
All of them.
You're drunk, Vazek.
That's why I don't take your word seriously.
Otherwise, I'd have you arrested for conspiring to endanger... the lives of this community.
That's the water.
The water rushing down to turn the turbines.
That'll make the machines work.
Doctor.!
Aren't you almost ready?
I'm setting the machines now. Everything will be ready for you in a little while.
Yes, but there's so little time.
I don't want to live through another spell.
Yes, I know. But please don't bother me now. I have work to do.
Remember, Doctor.
It must be tonight.
Why don't you lock him up... so you can give your full attention to do what you promised... to destroy the danger of the monster?
Please, Elsa, I know what I have to do.
But he's insane!
Insane?
He's not insane.
He simply wants to die.
Frank! Frank!
Listen to me, Frank.
I saw my father become obsessed by his power.
He died a horrible death, just as my grandfather did.
Yes, I know.
You promised the people to rid
Vasaria of this monstrous creation.
I want to be sure that nothing, nothing whatsoever, can sway you.
It is in your hands to undo the crimes my father and grandfather committed.
We must clear the name of Frankenstein.
All right. Tonight, I will draw off the monster's energy.
And I hope I'll bring peace to both of them.
"Connecting the plus poles to the minus...
"will charge the energy output of the nervous system... as by connecting the minus to the minus".
Connect the minus to the minus.
I can't do it.
I can't destroy
Frankenstein's creation.
I've got to see it at its full power.
Frank! You're making him strong again!
Frank, stop it!
Stop the machine, Frank!
Don't pull that switch!
Where's Vazek? He said he'd blow up the dam.
Look, Genevieve. Two men coming.
Let me see.
Oh, will you sell it?
Don't you understand?
Wait.
I'll get my father to buy it.
You sit down.
That's it. You wait.
Just a minute.
Oh, I forgot.
He's gone down to the fields.
Well, then, I'll have to buy it myself.
It doesn't belong to me.
Oh, well, maybe Father won't mind.
Oh, well, I can make you understand.
I have fine things.
You trade with me for that.
One, two, three.
Here, look. Very nice.
Look.
Open it.
Open it.
Very funny. Make you laugh.
Oh, my goodness.
Don't be cross. Don't go. Look.
You trade all this for that?
Oh, good!
I'm being very bad. It isn't mine.
Okay, all right.
Oh, goody! It's all mine!
Jill! Oh, Jill!
Go away! Father's coming.
Hurry! Go away!
Oh, my goodness.
Isn't he sweet?
He's better than a doll.
I can play with him.
He has to have a name.
Joe. I'll call him Joe.
Oh, Jill!
I'll surprise Father.
Be quiet.
Won't Father be surprised?
Jill.
Jill.
Where are you?
What's all this stuff?
What on earth?
Jill. Jill.
Surprise, Father. Aren't you surprised?
Jill, where did that come from?
Oh, that's Joe, Father. Isn't he sweet?
Joe? That's a baby gorilla.
Two men had him.
They didn't speak Swahili.
Really, Jill, you should have more sense.
Are you cross?
Well, for a tired man who just found a gorilla in his bed...
...I think I'm behaving very well.
You cannot have a pet gorilla.
Please let me keep him.
Please. I bought him.
How?
What did you have to buy him with?
Money and beads and toys, and other things.
Other things.
Where's my big flashlight?
Well, that makes him partly yours too, doesn't it?
I don't know what to say to you,
I'm sure.
I have worries enough trying to run this farm.
I'm sorry, but you can't keep him.
I will not raise a gorilla.
How the little fella loves his milk.
Does he always take his nap to music?
Oh, yes. This is his favorite song.
- What's the name of it?
- Don't you remember?
It's "Beautiful Dreamer."
Very appropriate.
I think he's grown already, don't you?
Oh, he'll grow, all right.
That's just the trouble.
But, Father, now I have someone to play with.
I know, dear. You're lonely sometimes.
If your mother had lived...
Baby, please try to realize that the time will come...
...when we can't keep Joe any longer.
This will always be his home, and we'll always be friends.
Listen, Jill, when he grows up, he'll be dangerous.
I know that seems impossible to you now...
...but that helpless little baby will be 10 times stronger...
...than any man in the world.
He'll weigh 7, 800 pounds.
He'll be a huge, fierce, dangerous gorilla.
Get me somebody that knows what I want.
Find me an electrician with ideas.
No, no. No, no.
I tell you, it isn't big enough.
Look, I'm branching out into new territory.
I'm building a nightclub in Hollywood.
It's got to be something original.
It's gotta knock them dead.
Take them back to the architect.
Bring me new sketches.
- What about my steamship tickets?
- Mr. Fletcher's here.
Tell Fletcher to wait.
Tell them all to wait.
I gotta shake up my press agent.
I got a letter of introduction,
Mr. O'Hara.
- What do you want?
- I thought maybe...
Well, I'd sure like to go to Africa.
So what? There you are.
Where you been, asleep?
- This is a letter of introduction.
- Half a column on page 20.
- That's good for the Times.
- This is from Tex Wood.
- Two paragraphs on the theatrical page.
- Best I could do.
I want front page!
You gotta get in there and pitch, Windy.
- These guys don't even believe I'm going.
- Can you blame them? I don't believe it.
Max O'Hara going to Africa to bring them back alive.
For what?
Why, there are 50 good animal acts...
...just begging for work right here in town.
Can't I get any cooperation?
Hey, you. What do you think?
Don't you think I ought to go to Africa?
- Why, sure.
- There. There you are. There's a smart guy.
- He agrees with you. He must be.
- This is from Tex Wood.
I don't see why you can't get front-page space, Windy.
We need a new angle.
That's what we need, a new angle.
Hello? What do you wanna talk to him about?
Oh, you wanna go to Africa.
No. No. No...
Say, who are you anyway?
That's a letter from Tex Wood.
Sure. He puts on the shows over at the Garden.
Yes, sir. Madison Square Garden.
Our show closed there last week.
- The rodeo?
- Yes, sir.
- You a cowboy?
- Yes, sir.
- Texas?
- No, sir. Oklahoma.
We rope and ride there too, you know.
I'm Gregg Johnson, champion roper.
All right. Well, what do you want here?
I saw in the paper how
Mr. O'Hara's going to Africa.
Now, there's a place
I've always wanted to see.
You reckon there's any chance he'd take me with him?
Oh, for the love of Mike. Why would he?
We're opening a nightclub, not a Wild West show.
But ain't there something I could do?
If I could just go, I might...
I got it! Hey, what's the matter with you?
What do I pay you for?
- I get all the ideas around here.
- Now what?
Got a new angle. Just thought of it.
It's great. I'll take cowboys.
- Cowboys? What for?
- To lasso lions, of course.
Maxie, you can buy all the lions you want in California.
But I'm gonna send you stories from Africa.
They'll fight to get them.
All you gotta do is pass them out.
Don't you understand? I'm gonna be in terrible danger in darkest Africa.
You're late for the dentist.
Who's the greatest press agent, you or me?
Don't answer.
Hey, you, come on.
You're gonna lasso lions.
- I am?
- Sure. Come on.
Round up some of your friends to help you.
We'll talk it over while I'm at the dentist's.
Who do you think is gonna get the worst of this, Maxie or Africa?
Hey, Ali, bring water for this lion, will you?
- He's a big one, isn't he?
- He sure is.
Just as full of fight as he was two weeks ago.
After you'd roped him, I thought for a few minutes I'd have to shoot him.
Sure glad you didn't.
That's right, Ali, give all simbas plenty maji. See?
Take the machina away.
Away.
Crawford.
Oh, Crawford!
Crawford, where are..?
Oh, there you are.
Look, I got another story to send.
Where's that telegraph office?
At Mdani, about 50 miles.
Have Gregg ride down, will you?
They don't know the way. I'll send one of the boys after they've eaten.
Let's have a spot of tea. Ahmed.
Tea. I hope this never gets back to Broadway.
I hope I never see another horse.
Well, O'Hara, we'll soon be saying goodbye.
You satisfied with the results of the safari?
Oh, sure. Just like I said, I got a million dollars' worth of publicity.
I hope your nightclub will be a great success.
As you've described it, it'll certainly be unusual.
Unusual? Look, nobody's ever seen anything like what I'm gonna give them.
I gotta get back. The date for the opening of my club is all set.
Just wondering if I've overlooked anything out here to make it bigger.
Well, I've read all the stories you've sent back...
...and I really think you've made the most of everything.
Yes, sir.
I sure made the front pages.
Oh, this is a great story I wrote today:
"How I Escaped From Pygmy Cannibals."
Pygmy cannibals? Did you really?
Was that today?
Yeah. They had me cornered.
I'd lost my gun.
They dropped a net over me from a tree.
I was fighting, struggling, but there was too many of them.
They were all over me like ants.
- How do you think I escaped?
- I have no idea.
Did I ever tell you about the mad elephant...
...that seized me in his trunk and flung me one half mile?
I went back afterwards and measured it.
You're catching on.
Hi, Gregg. How about a spot of tea, old boy, as we say in Africa.
Much obliged. I'm getting where I kind of like the stuff.
It took you six months, but you're kind of getting used to me too.
Well, I'm rapidly reaching a point...
...where nothing can surprise me, if that's what you mean.
What's the matter?
Listen.
Sorry, I must have imagined it.
I guess you thought I was a screwball at first, but my idea worked out.
Most successfully.
It's impossible. We're a hundred miles from that country.
- It is! But how can it..?
- What is it?
Ali, my gun! Big gun!
What's the matter?
- What are they saying?
- Darned if I know.
Ali, stop! Come back!
Gregg, get your men.
Slim! Boys, get your horses!
Lay off. No shooting.
Catch it. Rope it.
Are you crazy?
You can't rope a gorilla!
- Hurry up! He's getting away!
- Give me that gun!
You're crazy.
- Give me that gun!
- Don't shoot him.
Wait! You can't rope a gorilla!
Hey, where's my horse?
Stand still.
Whoa, horsey.
Cut it out, will you?
Don't do that! Don't do that!
Can't you cooperate?
There he is!
Where did he go?
He must be around here somewhere.
Hurry up, boys! Get behind him!
Get your rope ready!
Get another rope on it!
Get behind him!
Get another rope!
Look out!
Get behind him.
Get another rope!
Hey, Gregg, watch out!
Hey, Charlie, help!
No!
Hey, come here and help me!
Go on, get out there!
Get a rope on him!
Come here! Help me! Come on!
Where is he?
Don't let him get away!
Where did he go?
Help!
Help! Help!
Joe! Joe!
Help! Help!
Don't shoot! Joe, drop.
Drop it! Don't hurt him.
Don't do that.
Put him down!
Joe, drop it. Drop it, I said.
Help! Help!
- Drop it, I said!
- Help!
Joe, drop it.
What are you doing?
Why, my friend, he was getting killed.
Well, Joe is my friend, and you leave him alone.
Joe wouldn't hurt anybody.
He wouldn't if you treat him right.
Who are you, anyway?
What do you mean by this?
Well, your friend, he came into our camp.
Your camp? If it's within five miles of here, it's on my land.
This is all my property, and you keep off of it, you big bullies.
Come on, Joe.
Come on, I said.
All right, Joe.
Come on, Joe, leave them alone.
Mind me. Come along.
Joe! Come on, Joe, leave them alone.
We're going home.
Am I dreaming or did I see a gorilla and a beautiful dame?
Where did she go? Find out where she lives. I gotta talk to her.
Howdy.
Well, I reckon you're right, but I just wanna see the young lady.
I just wanna talk to the young lady.
I just wanna talk to the lady.
Afternoon, ma'am.
Seems like you always come just in time.
- What do you want?
- I'm Gregg Johnson.
I come to apologize.
With a gun?
Well, I kind of feel safer.
You were gonna shoot Joe.
But, ma'am, he had Mr. O'Hara.
If you hadn't come along, he...
- Oh, I was so frightened. Joe would've...
- He sure would.
If you'd let him alone, there wouldn't have been any trouble.
- We didn't know he belonged to anybody.
- He doesn't belong to anybody.
He lives here. Goodbye.
Wait, ma'am. Mr. O'Hara, the boss, he wants to talk to you.
- He sent me to ask you if it's all right.
- He's afraid?
Well, you can't blame him much.
Please don't be mad at us.
Well, I'm sorry, but you see,
Joe's the only friend I have.
Excuse me for asking, but where's your folks?
I haven't any.
You live here and run this place alone?
It's not so hard.
The servants and field hands all worked for my father for years.
He died six months ago.
I'm sorry.
It's a right pretty place.
I reckon this is my kind of country.
- But don't you ever get lonesome?
- Sometimes.
No, it's my home.
I've lived here all my life.
- It's beautiful. I love it. I...
- Hey, Gregg.
Tell your friends they can come out.
They don't need to be afraid.
How do you do, miss.
That gorilla around here?
Oh, don't worry.
I won't let him hurt you.
- I'm Max O'Hara. This is Mr. Crawford.
- My name's Jill Young.
Pleased to meet you, and I do mean pleased. Gregg told you we apologize?
And I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Don't mention it. Just a little misunderstanding all around.
Everything's jake now, huh?
Have I got plans for you, young lady.
Just wait till you hear.
I'll tell you all about it.
Let's sit down.
Well, come in, but no guns.
- No guns?
- No guns.
Don't you see what a great chance this is for you, honey?
Hollywood.
You must have heard of Hollywood.
- Yes, I've heard of it.
- That's where I'll open my nightclub.
I wanna make you a star.
You'll be the talk of the town.
Everybody'll be crazy about you.
You'll get beautiful clothes, have your hair fixed up. You'll be a knockout.
But I can't sing or dance or...
Who cares about that? All I want you to do is walk out on the stage.
You and Joe. Don't worry about a thing.
I got a contract here, all expenses paid.
With options, of course.
Oh, think of it, honey:
Music, glamour, bright lights, Hollywood.
You'll love it. Come on, honey, sign.
Excuse me for butting in, Mr. O'Hara.
I guess you'll be sore at me.
But, ma'am, you've got an awful pretty place right here.
Maybe you won't like it back there.
Hey, you keep out of this.
Of course she'll like it. Why not?
It sounds wonderful. I've never been anywhere. I'd love to travel.
And go to parties, have beautiful clothes.
You'll meet famous people.
You'll be famous.
Oh, quit rushing her.
Yes, you don't even give her time to think.
Say, what are you guys trying to do, stab me in the back?
That's gratitude, queering my deal.
I'm a square shooter.
I never went back on a contract in my life.
She don't even need a contract.
You take me for a cheap crook?
Think I rob widows and orphans?
I never did anybody dirt in my life.
Never in my life.
- Everybody knows that.
- O'Hara!
Why, my word's as good as my bond.
- Look out!
- Joe, stop!
Put it down, Joe.
Put that rock down.
Be quiet.
It's all right. Friends.
Joe, put that down, I tell you.
Mind me, this minute. Stop it.
Aren't you afraid of Joe?
I sure am, but I don't want him to know it.
I think perhaps you could make friends with him.
It's all right, Joe. Now, calm down.
Behave yourself. Now, listen.
That's a good boy.
Look, Joe, banana.
Will you be a good boy if I give it to you?
A banana, Joe.
Want another one? Here.
Go on, now. Go away.
Oh, boy, what an act.
I gotta sign her up.
Oh, honey, you're wonderful. Sign it.
Go on, honey, please sign it.
It's the chance of your lifetime.
What are you waiting for?
You don't wanna waste your life up in the woods like this.
Let me show you what the real world is like.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Daniels.
- Upstairs.
- And I thought you knew...
...every headwaiter in town.
- Some joint, huh?
- I'll say.
Gee, it looks just like Africa.
That's a good one.
What do you know about it?
Never even been out of the state.
Hey, I sure hope that's a thick piece of glass.
Sure it is, lady.
O'Hara had that made special.
That'll hold anything.
- Let's have a drink.
- You like to try our new cocktail?
- It's called the King of Beasts.
- He doesn't need it.
Shut up, sugar, or I'll throw you to the lions.
Lions are just darling.
I simply love them.
- You know what lions love, don't you?
- No.
Sweet little girls like you.
Oh, Micky, stop.
What do you suppose lions think about?
A drink. Maybe they're thirsty.
Poor kitty. Have a drink.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Who's Mr. Joseph Young?
How would I know?
That's Mr. O'Hara's big secret.
- Maxie's sure got a new angle.
- Yeah, but he never ran a zoo before.
He says these are the biggest lions in the world.
Sure, they would be. Leave it to Max.
- What do you suppose this set him back?
- Boy, suppose it's a flop.
Come on, drink up and go look at the show.
- Maxie, give. Who is Mr. Joseph Young?
- Give us the dope so we can turn in stories.
Yeah, we got deadlines.
Who is Mr. Joseph Young?
- You'll find out. Go on out front.
- Right this way, gentlemen.
The big show is just commencing.
- What's all the mystery?
- Tell us what it's all about.
Yeah, then we won't have to look at it.
- I'm warning you, this better be good.
- It will be. I'll join you in just a minute.
Holy smoke.
Max, I'm sick of keeping my lip buttoned.
This isn't the way we used to put over a show.
Windy, you are looking at the new Max O'Hara.
Dignified, restrained, artistic.
Classy. Go on out front.
You might learn something.
Dignified. Restrained. Artistic.
The shy type.
Hiya, Windy.
All right, Mr. O'Hara, it's about time.
All set back there? Jill ready?
How's Joe acting?
- Just fine.
- Good thing Joe likes you.
He sure does. I can handle him darn near as well as she can.
Your attention, please.
The one and only Max O'Hara.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...welcome to the Golden Safari.
I know you have all read of my exciting adventures in darkest Africa.
But I have never given out the story of the most wonderful experience of all.
That was the moment when I first met, face to face...
...the gentleman I am about to introduce to you.
But first you must meet his lifelong friend.
It is my privilege to introduce this charming young lady.
It is she alone who can completely control the amazing power...
...of the personage whose name appears in lights outside.
If you please.
This tune is an especial favorite of Mr. Joseph Young.
For the love of Mike, what's this supposed to be?
- Has Max gone nuts?
- Give it a chance, fellas. Give it a chance.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Joseph Young of Africa.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I thank you for your applause.
Here you see 10 men.
I have combed the country to find these men.
Let me introduce them.
First, Sammy Stein.
"Killer" Karl Davis.
Rasputin, the Mad Russian.
"Bomber" Kulky.
- "Slamming" Sammy Menacker.
- That's my boy!
- Max, the Iron Man.
- Wow, what a man!
- "Wee" Willie Davis.
- Look, he's got fur!
"Man Mountain" Dean.
The Swedish Angel.
The former heavyweight champion of the world...
...Primo Carnera.
Just look at them.
Every one a champion.
Look at those brawny arms, those massive chests.
I ask you, is there one creature in all the world...
...powerful enough to overcome that combination?
That is the question to which we seek an answer.
That is the test we are about to make.
When I give the signal, the fearless little lady...
...will bring my friend,
Mr. Joseph Young...
- My friend...
- Joe, stop it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.
Here, Joe, take it.
Now, boys, pull it.
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull.
Pull, Joe, pull. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull!
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe.
Pull harder, Joe. Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull!
Pull, Joe.
Joe, what are you doing?
Pick it up.
Pull, Joe.
Pull.
Help! Help! Let me go!
Help!
Let me down!
Let me down!
Go on, fella, get in.
Poor old boy.
Sorry I have to lock you up.
Well, Joe, I don't like it any more than you do.
But I reckon that's the way it's gonna be.
- Hello, where are you going?
- Jill's tired. I'm taking her to the hotel.
Jill, honey, everything turned out like I promised, huh?
- You're on top of the world.
- How..?
How long do you think you'll want us?
Don't you worry about that.
Your contract's good.
You and Joe will be working for me from now on.
Take good care of my little star, huh?
Well...
...that sounds like a long time, doesn't it?
Yeah, it sure does.
How big is he? How big is he?
How big is he?
Give me your autograph.
- That girl from Africa.
- The one with the gorilla?
Hey, how about a pass to the show?
Miss Young, my name is...
I'd like to get a pass to the show.
Go on, eat your dinner.
Lost your appetite, haven't you?
Guess I have too.
Poor old Joe. I don't blame you.
- Hello. Been mobbed again?
- Yes.
Mr. O'Hara said he'd make you famous.
- How's Joe today?
- He won't eat.
I was so stupid. I never realized he'd have to live in a cage.
Too bad.
Guess he's just too big for them.
My poor Joe, he's so unhappy.
That sign outside...
...I know just how he feels.
Ten weeks. It seems like 10 years.
Please don't cry, Jill.
Come on upstairs to O'Hara's office.
We've had enough of this.
Hello, children, come on in.
Well, we sure struck gold in California.
Business is great.
What can I do for you?
Jill's quitting.
Mr. O'Hara, Joe and I are going home to Africa.
- Are you crazy?
- Max, you talk too much.
- Now she wants more dough.
- No, it's got nothing to do with money.
- I want to take Joe back home.
- But you can't. You signed a contract.
You know that contract's no good.
She's underage.
- Hey, maybe you put her up to this.
- You keep out of this, Windy.
Look, honey, you can't do this to me.
You're throwing away good money.
You're breaking my heart.
I'm a square guy.
I told you I'd make you a star, that you'd have beautiful clothes.
You're famous.
You're all dressed up.
- I kept my promise, didn't I?
- Mr. O'Hara, I'm sorry.
I don't wanna seem ungrateful.
You've been very kind.
You think all this is wonderful.
I thought it was going to be too.
But Joe can't live in a cage, and...
...neither can I.
- Oh, honey, talk sense.
It is sense. We're not going to kill Joe.
Well, all right, if that's the way you feel, but...
But you'll give me a little time.
I mean, I've got to get another act to take your place.
I've got to protect my investment.
You wouldn't just walk out on me.
Why, of course, I...
I want to do whatever is right.
Sure you do. Now, I'm gonna take you out and buy you a swell lunch.
Just to show you there's no hard feelings.
I knew you wouldn't let old Maxie down.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Just don't rush me...
...and everything's gonna turn out all right.
You want to go,
I wouldn't try to talk you out of it.
I'd be the last person in the world that would ever...
- What's that?
- Big money for the big monkey.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...when the music starts again, start throwing your money.
One table has a lucky number.
If Mr. Joseph Young picks it up...
...it means free champagne. Ready?
Pick it up.
Pick it up, Joe.
Your cap, Joe. Take off your cap, Joe.
Stop! Stop!
Curtain.
- Who got the lucky number?
- The monkey never even picked it up.
It's a gyp. O'Hara stopped the act so he wouldn't have to give away a drink.
Cigars? Cigarettes?
Hi, babe. Sit down, join the party.
No, thank you, sir. Cigars? Cigarettes?
- Come on, sit down.
- I can't do that, sir. Cigarettes?
But, look, you've ruined my...
- Say, I'll have to pay for these.
- Shut up. Get out.
- Go on, scram. Get out.
- Run along, kid. It's okay.
Listen, you guys...
...cut out the rough stuff or I'll throw you to the lions.
Kid's cigarettes will be on your check.
Enjoy yourselves, gentlemen.
- Who does he think he is?
- Insulting us.
- This joint's dead. Let's get out of here.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I got a great idea. Wait a minute.
- I wanna have some fun.
Let's buy a drink for the big monkey, huh?
- Where's O'Hara?
- Don't worry about him, he's gone.
Come on, everybody bring a bottle.
That's a great idea.
That grouch O'Hara, let's show him we can have some fun.
Poor old monkey.
Bet O'Hara never bought him a drink.
Come on, follow me.
- You better eat something.
- I can't.
How could I let Mr. O'Hara talk me into doing that new act tonight?
He's a fast talker.
Think of me letting Joe stand up there...
...and be a target, a clown...
...for all those awful people.
I'll never do it again.
You bet you won't.
That's too dangerous.
There, you see?
I told you I could find him.
Look at him, very sad.
- He isn't having any fun.
- He needs a drink.
Make him feel good, like us.
Come on, fella. Won't you..?
Won't you join us, Mr. Young?
It's good for you. Forget your troubles.
Come on, that's a sport.
This is good stuff.
Watch me.
Good. See?
Now you take it.
Come on. Don't you wanna feel good?
Try it. It'll grow hair on your chest.
That's a boy. Come on, that's it.
- You think he'll like it?
- Of course he'll like it. Just what he needs.
Come on, try it.
He doesn't know what to do with it.
Hey, chum, watch me.
He caught on. Look at that, he drinks like a gentleman.
- Look at him pour it down.
- He likes it, all right.
Here's looking at you, Mr. Joseph Young.
- Wants more.
- Why don't you give it to him.
- I gave him mine.
- Okay, big boy.
- We're showing him a good time.
- Sure. We're good sports.
And Mr. Young's a good sport.
That's right, Mr. Young.
- Look at that, two bottles.
- Can you imagine the size of his hangover?
Oh, brother.
What a headache he's gonna have.
I'd like to see O'Hara throw him out.
Please stop worrying.
I won't let O'Hara talk you out of it.
Just to make sure that he doesn't, I'll stand on the pier until your ship is out of sight.
That's wonderful.
I wish I could make Joe understand we're really going home.
But aren't you coming too?
But if you don't, that would spoil everything.
You're always saying what a wonderful place my farm is.
You mean you don't want to go back.
Listen, Jill, you can't go around asking guys to go to Africa with you.
I don't. I'm asking you.
Well, of course I wanna go any place you go...
...but I didn't figure you felt like that. Do you?
Of course I do.
Great day in the morning.
Excuse, please.
Jumping catfish, what a thirst.
- Don't you wish you could do that?
- He's just a hog.
He doesn't leave any for us.
That's gratitude.
I'll bet you he could drink up all the liquor in this joint.
Well, I'm not gonna buy him any more.
He's drunk. Disgusting.
Listen, Mr. Young, if you can't handle your liquor, you shouldn't drink.
You drank all our good liquor, you big moocher.
- You ought to be ashamed.
- What, again?
- No, lay off, will you?
- You drank it all.
I'll teach you.
Drink all our liquor, will you?
He'll get out!
- Look out!
- Help! Help!
He's out! He's out!
Look out! Look out!
Help!
Get out of the way!
Please, don't rush! Please don't panic.
Take it easy, will you? Don't run.
Take it easy, folks.
Help!
Help! Help!
- What's happened?
- Joe's loose. He's gone crazy.
- Help me get in.
- Come on.
That ape tried to kill me.
Hear that? Police.
- They'll shoot Joe.
- Keep them out. Give me just a minute.
Joe! Joe!
Stop it!
Stop it, Joe!
Stop that, Joe. Come on.
Come on, Joe.
Please get up, Joe.
All right, break it up! Break it up!
Wait a minute, boys.
Take it easy, will you, fellas?
- Out of the way!
- Wait a minute.
Hurry, Joe.
Shooting the lions!
Joe.
Oh, no.
Your Honor...
...I’m not unsympathetic to Miss Young.
But in view of the destruction and panic already caused by this dangerous animal...
...I cannot allow sentiment to influence me.
Again, I submit that the court order should be carried out.
I'm very sorry, Miss Young, but he must be shot.
He'll never break out again, lady.
Them new bars will hold anything.
Joe...
There isn't anything I can do, Joe.
I tried.
They wouldn't listen.
Gregg and I were gonna take you back home.
It was nice back there at home, wasn't it?
Nobody hated us.
Nobody wanted to kill...
Now, lady, you don't wanna act like that.
You don't wanna be down here when they come to shoot him.
Look, you go and find O'Hara and the young fella.
They're likely upstairs in the office.
Go on, now.
That's a good girl.
Well, it's after 8:00.
Where's Schultz and his court order?
- I don't like this job much.
- It's just like shooting a mad dog.
Well, let's get it done.
I got a date tonight.
Chin up, kid.
Max has a scheme.
I don't know what, but we're not licked yet.
- But where did they go?
- I don't know.
But you can count on Max.
Those men are coming.
They'll shoot Joe.
- We've got a plan, Jill.
- We'll get Joe out.
- Get him out of the state?
- Out of the country.
- Joe's going back to Africa.
- You mean it?
Listen, honey.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
If Joe gets shot, it's my fault.
You and Joe don't belong here.
I talked you into this.
It's up to me to get you out.
I'll get you back home if I have to go to jail for it.
We paid the captain of a freighter down at the harbor.
He promised us not to sail till 6:00 in the morning.
How will we get Joe out?
There's police there.
I've got a plan.
It will take split-second timing.
We've all gotta work together.
Now, listen...
Hello, Moran.
Just came down to take my last look at poor old Joe.
Okay by me.
Just keep that girl out of here.
They'll be here to shoot him in a minute.
Too bad.
I got a lot of money tied up in you.
Goodbye, Joe.
I should have left you in Africa, where you belong.
The old heart. Help me.
Help.
Upstairs. My office.
Easy, now. Easy, now.
You'll be all right.
My office.
- My medicine.
- Take it easy, I've got you.
Good evening, O'Hara.
What's the matter, Moran?
- Why aren't you guarding the ape?
- He took sick. I had to help him.
- My heart. Sit down.
- No thanks.
- Here's the court order. We'll do the job.
- No, don't go. Wait.
- I got a date.
- I haven't read the court order.
Nothing wrong with it.
- You coming?
- No, my heart. The strain.
- Come on.
- Let's go this way. It's shorter.
This won't take long.
Getting kind of careless, aren't you, Moran?
Hey, he's gone!
Hurry, Joe, get in.
Hey, you, stop!
They got into a white van.
Get to a phone! O'Hara's office.
Schultz wants you up in my office.
Right in here.
O'Hara!
Police headquarters.
Operator. Police headquarters.
Operator, wake up! Wake up!
Schultz, here's a tip-off.
A map of Las Vegas.
- They're getting out of state.
- Here I am.
- O'Hara said you wanted me.
- O'Hara?
Operator. Oper...
- I'll get that guy! Get to a phone.
- Get to a phone.
O'Hara ought to catch up along here somewhere. Watch out for him.
Hey, take a look at this.
Get to a phone.
Turn in a general alarm.
Hold it. I hope the kids made it.
I'll take a look.
Here they come.
So long, Windy. Be seeing you.
- Step on it, Gregg.
- I gotta get some air in that front tire.
Give us some air in the left front.
Got a slow leak.
- You want I should change your wheel?
- No, I'm in a hurry.
Yeah, in a big white van, probably heading for Las Vegas.
Calling all cars. Escaped gorilla in large white van headed north.
Animal very dangerous. Shoot on sight.
Fine, it worked.
They think we're headed north.
- What happened? What was that?
- I don't know, but Joe's all right.
- Okay, Schultz, we go north, huh?
- Those roads are well covered.
That map may be one of O'Hara's tricks.
We go south.
- What you got?
- One for the tank, sarge...
...and has he got the horrors.
Running up and down the road, yelling like a banshee.
Take him back.
I'll book him when he's sober.
Now, hold on. That's my old man's lingo.
Get me headquarters.
Captain O'Toole?
This is Obrinski.
Yeah, we just got a report on the gorilla.
This is the real thing.
Calling all cars. Escaped gorilla reported at service station...
... Duane and Tilford.
Hey, that's not far from here.
Repeat. Escaped gorilla reported at service station, Duane and Tilford.
They got us spotted.
They know we're headed south.
What will we do?
Look out!
What do you think you're doing?
Wanna get us all killed?
- Who you yelling at?
- Get off of the road.
You asked for it.
- I'll move the truck.
- Jill, get Joe out.
- What's the idea?
- How much gas has he got?
Oh, I get it. Half a tank.
- Help Jill.
- Right.
- Hey, you seen a big white van?
- Sure did.
- There's something funny about it.
- Going south?
- Yeah.
- That's it.
Hurry, Joe. Hurry!
Get in, Joe. Get in.
Take that road.
It's the back way to the harbor.
I'll see you at the ship.
I hope so.
There it is.
- O'Hara. What are you doing here?
- Was I going too fast?
Come out of there. You thought you'd put one over on me, didn't you?
This is a great indignity.
I demand an explanation.
- Shut up. Open those doors.
- Wait! What are you going to do?
- Shoot that gorilla.
- It's empty.
- Don't open it.
- Get out!
Don't open it. You'll be sorry.
You'll be sorry. You'll get hurt.
Ready, boys? Open the door.
Hey, where's my truck?
Somebody stole my truck.
You smart aleck.
You got the gorilla in a truck.
- What you talking about?
- Where are they?
- Not your business.
- Come!
- Want him too?
- For what?
O'Hara, you're obstructing justice.
Where's that gorilla?
You better start talking, O'Hara.
- I think I'm gonna have a heart attack.
- Fine, have it in there.
Turn around. Back to that crossroad.
That's where they went.
I wonder how long Mr. O'Hara can hold them.
I don't know, but we better get off this road.
I wonder where that fool thinks he's going.
Hang on!
Get out, Joe.
Come on, Joe, push!
Like this, Joe. Push!
- A truck just went down there.
- That must be it.
Push, Joe! Push!
Here they come.
There's the gorilla. Shoot!
Get in, Joe!
- No, you'll hit the girl!
- Get the tires!
- Come on, you, push!
- I will not.
Go in.
Two more. Two more children upstairs.
Jill!
Jill!
Children, where are you?
Jill!
Gregg!
Gregg!
Get to the roof.
Joe!
Joe!
Joe! Joe!
Joe, in here.
Joe!
Gregg!
Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
Look!
Go back, Joe. Go up.
There's a baby up there, Joe.
Go up, Joe. Joe, go up.
My poor Joe.
It's all right, kid. There's nobody in the world gonna shoot Joe now.
No, no, no. It isn't big enough.
Max O'Hara, I didn't know you were back in New York.
Read the paper.
I've been back for months.
Hi, Max. I got 200 girls for you to look at.
They'll be at the pool tomorrow, 10:00.
- They all gotta swim like fish.
- Sure.
It'll be the greatest water show.
Singers, dancers, jugglers, acrobats...
...all in the water.
- I can get you a great act.
- It could work on a raft.
- What?
- Monkeys.
- Nix. Cut it out, will you? See you later.
- Hey, what is this?
- I got a big surprise for you, Maxie.
What is it? Hurry it up.
I got a million things to do.
You've got time for this.
Wait till you see it.
Hey.
Look at that.
The kids told me to spring it on you.
Crawford took it.
He went up there to visit them.
Hi, Jill.
Hello, Max.
Hey, they said, "Hello, Max."
And they lived happily ever after.
I sure hope so.
They will. They're back home where they belong.
Two pounds, seven for the Burberry and the hat.
There you are. Thank you, sir.
Did you come off the Ella Campbell, sir?
Who told you?
Who said I came off the Ella
Campbell? Who's been spying on me?
Why, nobody, sir. L
- I just thought she's unloading...
I don't wanna be spied on.
Understand? I've had enough of that.
Yes, sir. No offense, I assure you.
Here's your change, and thank you, sir.
I say, uh, I'm sorry I jumped on you. Quite all right, sir.
You see, I've been away. Have you now?
And where have you been, might I ask?
I don't know. I've been lost.
And you won't be wanting these, sir?
Oh, it's just an old rag. Keep it. I'm on my way to plenty.
Thank you, sir. And good luck to you.
Will you join us in a cocktail?
We can't, Mother. We're late.
It's his fault. It's not my fault. It's my editor's.
You're a journalist, aren't you? Well, that's nicely put.
I'm a reporter. Oh, but you do write features.
Now, Julie, don't interrupt. You're stopping at the inn, I believe?
Yes, it's quite attractive. He says the maids are very pretty too.
I say, Julie, I wouldn't take that bright line with Lady Anstey if I were you.
Mark, do you think your grandmother will find me an evil influence?
You don't know my grandmother. Shall we go?
All right. Are you sure you can't stay to dinner?
I'm afraid not, Mother. We're late already.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, darling.
They weren't so grim, were they? No.
Did I look as silly as I felt? I wondered if you felt as silly as you looked.
Well? Well, she might pick worse.
Heavens, yes. Best blood in the county.
Family, yes. But no money, of course.
Well, after all, our grandchildren would hardly starve.
Julie.
Yes? A person, SirJasper, by appointment.
Appointment? Yes, sir. He said it's oflong-standing.
- Irene, did you...
- Who is it, Cleghorn?
He said his name is Robert Griffin.
- What did you say?
- His name, Robert Griffin, sir.
Well, you didn't hear right. You couldn't.
Show him in at once! Yes, sir.
Why, Jasper, it isn't possible.
It can't be Rob! I wonder.
But they told us... Salim swore that...
Hello, Jasper. Irene.
Now don't tell me you don't recognize me.
Rob! Rob, you old rascal, you.
Oh, Rob, my dear! Oh, thank heaven...
I knew you'd be glad to see me. My old friends.
But how on earth did you... Where have you been?
Come on. Give me your coat.
Sit down. Tell us what happened.
Maybe you'd better tell me. I was a little confused that last day.
Well, no wonder. You were burning up with fever.
Yes. Fighting our way through that foul jungle.
You and Jasper were right behind me.
I remember that part of it. And all of a sudden...
I saw it, Rob. The branch,
I mean. I saw it fall.
I called, "Look out!"
Dear Irene. You did your best, I know.
But something hit me on the head!
We thought you were done for. Yes.
And you went on without me. Look here, Rob.
The supplies were running out, and the bearers were getting out of hand.
Do you think I should have stayed with you and sent Irene on alone?
Why, no, Jasper, not for the world.
It wasn't easy going on without you, Rob, but we left Salim with you.
The only one we could trust. When he caught up with us, he swore that you had died.
You see, we... we had no reason to doubt him.
What happened, Rob, after you came to?
Uh, I don't know.
I don't remember a single thing after I got that blow on the head.
Not until the next blow.
That was two months ago. No!
Why, it's more than five years. I know.
And they're gone, clean gone!
What I did or where I went, it's all a blank.
Until two months ago. And then?
Well, I-I was working on the docks in Durban.
That's where I got hit by a loading crane.
And that brought your memory back? Perfectly.
I came to in a hospital in Natal.
I knew if I could ever get back to you, my old friends, that you'd be waiting for me. Oh, but naturally.
Waiting to hand over my share, my full share.
I've kept the agreement, you know.
Remember how we drew it up in Kalo's Hotel in Mozambique?
Here.
"One-half of any and all properties discovered in the Tanganyika country. "
That's quite right, old boy.
We found it, didn't we?
A whole diamond field.
That is, I found it.
I made you rich, didn't I?
Yes, it turned out pretty well for all of us, Rob.
What do you mean pretty well?
There was a million in it.
There was, but there isn't now. Why not? Why isn't there?
Oh, I lost it, Rob, a great part of it anyway. Bad investments.
- Of my money?
- Rob, please try to understand.
We thought that you were dead.
You were our closest friend.
You told us yourself you had no relatives.
Oh, who cares what you thought? The paper says...
But I haven't got it, I tell you!
I'll give you half of our own money, more than half.
That's not enough. Oh, please...
I want it all! You'll ruin us.
Who cares? You'll take everything, even Shortlands?
To the last penny, if there's any law in England.
I've got my proofs. I'll have you in court.
I'll make your name a byword. I'll tell them how you tried to murder me.
Now, hold on, Rob! That's not true.
But, Jasper, he's right.
A mere half would be an insult. Don't worry, Rob.
I'm not the one that has to worry.
You'll get all that's coming to you.
Now, how about a drink? I think we all need it. Yes. L-I'll get it.
Uh, Jasper. Would you mind poking up the fire a bit?
What will you have, Rob? Whiskey.
Done yourself well, haven't you?
Is this one of your bad investments?
I didn't buy Shortlands. It came down to me.
Like your title? Old and honorable, eh?
Stop being sinister, Rob.
It isn't becoming.
Here you are. Thanks.
A bit smoky, that scotch. I hope you don't mind. Jasper.
I'm sorry I jumped on you like that.
Well, here's how.
Julie? Yes, that's Julie.
I'd know her anywhere.
I bet you never dreamed what became of that picture you had of her on safari.
It was lost. No, it wasn't.
I've got it. I've kept it always.
I'm a deep one, you know.
I've always been a deep one. Lay my plans ahead.
Why not? It's the thing to do, isn't it?
Marry into some honorable family, good blood.
I'm as good as the next one, aren't I? Why, of course, Rob.
Well, then why isn't she here? She'll be home tomorrow.
Hmm. I... must spruce up a bit.
Never do to see me like this. L...
- Jasper, help him.
- Here, hold on now.
What's the matter? L
- I don't know. L...
Everything is swimming. Sit down a minute.
It'll pass. So much excitement.
L
- I'll be all right.
Don't try anything.
L
- I want my half.
L
- I wantJulie.
He's unconscious. What's happened to him, Irene?
The man is definitely psychopathic.
You see how one drink has affected his warped mind?
This is not the man we knew and loved, Jasper.
This is a madman. He's dangerous.
He honestly believes we tried to kill him in Africa.
There's no telling what he may do when he regains consciousness.
We've got to get him off the property.
Yes, I suppose so. It seems brutal, but...
Well, I suppose it's the best way, for his sake as well as ours.
The authorities will pick him up and care for him.
I won't let him ruin our lives and Julie's.
No, no, you can't do that, Irene.
You heard what he threatened.
Do you want a scandal?
Do you want him blackmailing us and persecuting Julie?
No, of course not.
Then we must keep this and take care of it... until he's rational again, and then give it back to him... and make whatever settlement he feels is fair.
Naturally, neither of us want to cheat him out of his rights, but certainly we can't have a madman roaming about... with a club like this over our heads.
As soon as he's able to walk...
Well, it won't do you any good,
'cause I'll come back, Jasper.
I'll come back. And when
I do, I'll get you and...
- Oh, Cleghorn.
- Yes, sir?
If that fellow ever shows his face in here again, send for the police.
- You understand?
- Yes, SirJasper.
I gotta go home to my... wife
Home to my sweet storm and strife
Help!
Help!
Hello!
Help! Somethin's happened around 'ere.
'Ere! Come over 'ere! Hey, come over 'ere!
Move your hands! Over 'ere!
Keep it comin'. 'Ere we are.
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
'Ere you are. Come right up 'ere. There you are.
Come on, old lad. That's the stuff. Get right up there.
My word! What happened to ya?
And if you think of makin' me an handsome reward for savin' your life, why, Let's not talk about it.
That is, not now.
You know, if half of what you told me is true, we've got a case against
SirJasper and his lady... that'll rock this bloomin' kingdom to its foundations.
Hey, we can make a pretty penny besides too, you know.
It's all true, every word of it.
I've got the proof right here.
The agreement, signed with his own handwriting.
Half of everything we find, we... Why...
Why, it's gone!
Gone?
Yes, they've stolen it. Are you sure?
Have a look yourself. Did you look in all the pockets?
Most 'struth!
Blimey! Nipped your papers and tried to drown you besides.
A bit nasty, I calls it. Crooks! Murderers!
If there was only some way I could make them pay.
Oh, they'll pay, all right. Have no fear of that.
You don't think I'm going to sit still and see me old friend put upon, do you?
Not on your life! I fight for you and I'll bleed for you!
Now stop worrying, will you?
'Cause from now on, I'm takin' charge. What I need is a lawyer.
A legal mind, that's what we need, all right. But who?
Hey, I know the very bloke!
Who? Jim Feeny. He's fearless, and you can trust him.
A little.
I'll watch him too.
Sure! Look. Me and him, we'll go marching up to Shortlands tomorrow.
And I'll see SirJasper and I'll tell him off right to his bare face!
I must remind you, Herbert, of the Law of Criminal Libel.
All right. All right. But you ain't going to look very nice in court... with charges of murder and robbery against ya.
Eh, very grave charges, SirJasper, but, uh, we're not unreasonable.
We're here to discuss a settlement out of court.
Yes. Empowered by my friend and partner, Rob Griffin.
And what does your old friend and partner expect to get?
Half. No less than half of what you took out of his diamond mine.
And damages to the tune of a million pounds.
That's what we're gonna ask for, and that's what we're gonna get, if I've got to fight through every court in England,
up to the very steps of the throne itself. Excuse me, sir.
What is it, Cleghorn? Her ladyship wishes to remind you it's teatime.
And Sir Frederick Travers has dropped in.
Would you please ask Sir Frederick to be so good as to join us here?
Yes, sir.
Did you say Sir Frederick Travers?
Yes.
The chief constable.
Well, what are you starin' at me like that for, Jim Feeny?
Looks like you swallowed your own Adam's apple.
I'm not afraid. I don't care who comes in the room.
I have a conscience as pure as a baby's breath.
Now look, SirJasper, how 'bout making a settlement for 50 pounds?
This is me last word. Hello, Herrick.
Hello, Travers. Sit down, won't you? Well, what's the latest?
Oh, nothing much, except our friend here is just trying a spot of blackmail.
Blackmail, indeed.
Blackmail? When I bring a story here as true as gospel?
Well, if you don't believe me, ask Griffin.
Who's Griffin? Some tramp who turned up here yesterday.
- I threw him out.
- Threw him out?
You threw him in... the river.
And I jumped in after him at the risk of me own life.
I don't know what he may have got into afterwards, but he left here on his own legs.
If you wish, you may ask my butler. He saw him go.
Oh, you've got a witness. Well, that alters the case entirely. I was misled.
Grossly misled. Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I wash my hands of the whole affair.
You and Pontius Pilate.
Well, do you wish to prosecute? Yes, I think...
No, SirJasper. Please. Now look.
There's something wrong here.
I'm an honest man. I was inveigled in this by this bloke Feeny.
And Griffin, I never saw him before in me life till last night.
Herbert, you better stick to your shoe-mending.
And tell your pal Griffin to get out of my jurisdiction.
Yes, sir. He gets right out of my house tonight.
Fine. I'll send a constable just to make sure he goes.
Thank you. Good night, sir.
Yes, what is it? I've missed my way.
Can you tell me where I'll hit the
London road? It's a bad night to be out.
I haven't any choice. You look ill.
I'm quite fit, thanks. Are you, indeed?
It happens I'm a doctor. Come in.
Maybe I'd better warn you.
There's a constable after me.
Constable?
You are a fugitive?
- Next thing to it.
- Come in just the same.
I may be able to help you.
A criminal needs a doctor's care... I'm no criminal!
Two of your local bigwigs robbed me. Now they're running me out of the district.
Oh, that's too bad.
Picking on a stranger, huh?
A man without a friend.
That's what I am. It's good of you to help me.
Maybe we can help each other. Come this way.
Oh, don't be afraid. We're quite alone.
My neighbors give me a wide berth.
That's what I want, to be left in peace.
Only to be left in peace until... Quiet, Snapper.
Pioneers have always had to contend with fools.
Look at Galileo. Look at Pasteur.
Huh? Who believed Curie, except his wife? What about Ehrlich?
Mind the stairs here. The steps are uneven.
Peel off your coat. Make yourself at home.
I could do with a spot of whiskey. Right.
I don't entertain often.
But the day will come when the greatest scientists of Europe will knock at my door.
Then you'll be proud to say you once had supper with the great Dr. Drury.
There you are. Sit down, help yourself.
Thanks.
Well, happy days! Well, happy days!
- What was that?
- Methuselah, my old parrot.
Beautiful plumage, hasn't he?
Hello! Hello!
Yes, beautiful.
I, uh, I suppose you think I'm mad, don't you?
No, no.
Quiet, Brutus.
I'm not a crank, you know, nor a quack.
Look at my degrees there on the wall.
Aberdeen, Berlin, Vienna.
Coming, Brutus, coming.
Come on, boy.
Steady. I'll just chain you up to be sure. Come on, boy.
I might have been a fashionable physician, yes, with my brougham and my titled patients, but there was something bigger.
Do you want it? Speak for it.
That's the boy. Nicely now. Don't snatch.
In the name of... What's the matter?
Can't I feed my dog? Or don't you think there is a dog?
Why, why, yes, of course.
Only... Only you doubt it, huh?
Very well. Put out your hand, feel it.
Quiet, Brutus.
But there is a dog.
A huge one. L
- I could feel it. Of course, of course.
And specially trained as my bodyguard.
He'd probably kill anyone that raised a hand to me.
But the dog's invisible. That's impossible.
In this house, you've got to believe what you can't see.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
Lie down.
What a breeze! What a breeze!
Sails down. Sails down.
What a breeze! What a breeze!
It's... It's incredible.
Not at all, if you grasp the theory.
Tell me. Have you ever studied optical density? Molecular physics?
No. No? That's too bad.
See here, in simple terms...
You're an intelligent man.
A body either absorbs light or it reflects it or it refracts it.
If it does none of these things, if its refractive index is sufficiently lowered, it cannot of itself be visible.
Can you grasp that? Well, I...
Well, let's look at it this way. The air you breathe...
It has body, hasn't it?
And yet, you can't see it.
Or clear water in a glass bottle.
Haven't you ever been fooled and thought it empty?
Well, why, yes.
Well, then it's not so strange, is it?
The problem was to find a formula, a geometric expression involving four dimensions... for use on tissue.
Bone, blood. I found it.
But how, how did you first...
I began working with small animals... mice, rabbits, guinea pigs.
Brutus here is the biggest subject I've worked on... so far.
And it... it doesn't hurt?
It hasn't hurt him. He's well and happy.
Whereas, before, it was a tough life, wasn't it, old boy?
A big mongrel. Nobody's cur.
The well-bred dogs of the gentry picked on him. They would.
He hadn't a chance when they came in couples.
They all hunt in couples, the gentry.
But when I made him invisible, then it was his turn. Wasn't it, old boy?
Had them at his mercy, didn't he? Oh, quite.
Made them wish they'd never been born.
Now, if a man were invisible, he'd be hard to find.
You couldn't make a man invisible.
You're just talking. You're boasting! You couldn't.
Oh, couldn't I?
If he had the courage, if he weren't a weakling.
A neurotic with a persecution complex.
Who hasn't got the courage?
I warned you fairly.
I've never tried this on a human being.
Get on with it. I've got nothing to lose.
Oh, if you could just make me like that dog.
I think I can.
And if I can't...
They'll have you up for malpractice, is that it?
No.
Murder. Are you ready?
Go ahead.
Will it take long? I can't be sure.
Will I lose consciousness? For a while.
Stopped raining, hasn't it?
Yes.
Look here. I don't feel any different.
Wait.
What is it? Oh,
I was just thinkin', what a cat-and-mouse game.
Enemy they can't see.
C
- Can't get a... get ahold of.
A man!
An invisible man!
The pulse is still strong.
Why, I've outstripped the immortals of science.
Archimedes, Copernicus,
Faraday, Darwin.
Now I am immortal.
Look, here. How long is this going to take? I can't lie here all night.
Wait a minute. I think perhaps a swallow of brandy.
Here. Drink this.
Now lie still.
I want to make some notes while this experiment is still fresh in my mind.
Why, my hand, i-it's gone.
It worked. Dr. Drury!
Why didn't you tell me? Is there any danger of my turning visible again?
Ha! Not till you're dead.
And I've got a good long while before that, and a lot to do.
Yes, there is a lot to do. Now you'd better lie down and get some sleep.
And don't worry? Me, worry?
Others will do the worrying.
Tomorrow I'll plan my campaign.
I must inform the papers. There'll be interviews and pictures.
I'll be invited to address the Royal
Societies. Run along and get some rest.
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.
I'm no human guinea pig to make you famous.
I've got my own plans.
Why, you can't do that! You can't go now!
You thought you got rid of me, Jasper,
but I've come back.
Who's that? It's me, Jasper.
Your old friend Bob
Griffin. Don't you remember?
What is this?
Where are you?
You can't see me, Jasper.
I know. I know, you're outside.
But you're hiding somewhere.
Cold, Jasper. Still cold.
But you're in this room, Griffin!
And I'll find you! Yes, Jasper.
I am in the room. I'm over here.
But you can't find me, Jasper.
I can see you, but you can't see me.
Oh, I could brain you if I wanted to.
Now you're at my mercy.
I could strangle you.
No!
See how easy it is. He-Help! Help!
What is it you want, Griffin?
I'll tell you what I want.
I want everything you've got. I want your money.
I want your house. And
I'm going to takeJulie.
Sit down, Jasper.
Sit down and write what I tell you!
I've already killed three men with a knife like this, and I wouldn't mind making it four.
Now sit down and write!
I, Jasper Herrick, of my own free will, do hereby confess...
that I twice tried to murder my good friend, Robert Griffin...
You're mad, Griffin! That's a lie, and you know it.
Shut up and write!
In order to rob him of that certain property... known as Herrick Mines Limited, situated in the Tanganyika
Territory near Mongaburra.
In, uh, in partial expiation of my crime,
I hereby assign all of my property... to said Robert Griffin, including the estates known as Shortlands.
No, no, I... I won't do that! Oh, yes, Jasper.
Or would you rather have your throat cut?
That's it.
Now sign it.
Now give it to me. I don't trust you, Jasper.
But I've got you right where I want you.
From now on, you'll do exactly as I say.
"... Griffin... ... certain property... known as Herrick Mines Limited, situated... "
Hey, no, you don't! Up to your old tricks, eh, Jasper?
I'll take that chair.
For heaven's sake, Jasper, what is it?
He's here, Irene!
Who? Griffin! He's here in this room!
Yes, yes, dear, but if you'll just lie down. I know, you think I'm...
No, no, of course not. You're just upset.
Jasper, what...
Why, you mustn't write things like this ever!
No, no, no, don't tear it!
Jasper, let go. Let me go.
He's mad, I tell you, Irene. He'll kill you!
Who? Griffin. He's here in this room!
He's invisible. Oh, Jasper, stop it! I'm ashamed of you.
Get hold of yourself. There's no such thing as an invisible man.
That's where you're wrong.
Now I'll take this.
Oh, dear.
Oh, love should be
Hello, who's there? Let me in!
This is a nice time of the morning to come knocking on me door.
Must be barmy. Say, what do you think... Get outta my way!
Say, who do you think you are, shovin' me around my own house?
I'm Bob Griffin. Shut the door.
Griffin? Oh, I say, what's happened? What's happened?
Have you been scalded, or have you got the mange?
Neither. I'm invisible.
You...
Oh, don't make me laugh!
Next thing you'll be telling me you curl up and sleep in a buttercup.
Ah! You're as solid as I am. You don't believe me, eh?
No! Come here.
What? Have a look.
Oh, blimey!
Oh, it's the truth!
I had to put these wrappings on.
I was causing too much excitement, wandering around without any head.
I'll have to stay with you.
You're the only man I can trust.
Where do you think you're going? Oh, I'm not going out.
I'm just, uh, locking the door so nobody can come in.
Hurry up and get me some breakfast. I'm hungry.
Yes.
Right away.
I'm very sorry, but I have nothing but a very old moldy pancake to offer you.
Look, eh, why don't you go down to the inn?
They have a very nice breakfast down there. Two kinds of jam and a bit of fish.
Hurry up with the pancakes.
Pancake, eh? Right-o, pancake.
Well, this flour here is a bit wormy. Do you mind? No.
Oh.
All right, here we go. Pancake, huh? Uh...
Oh, I say, look 'ere.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk!
There's been a mouse in it.
Sounds as if you don't want to serve me.
Oh, not at all! I'm very happy to do it. Very happy!
Here. Could you...
W
- Would you mind puttin' this bag over your head?
I'm afraid you're gonna catch cold.
Here. See here!
Maybe this'll convince you I have a head.
When I put something on it, you can see it. Now watch.
- How's that?
- Blimey!
Y- Y-You're the dead spit of yourself!
All right, now stop your chattering and get my breakfast.
Yes, sir, right away.
And, eh... Er, oh, uh...
You know, I'm very happy to have you here, but, I'm sorry to tell you, you can't stay.
- Why not?
- Well, I'll tell ya.
This time tomorrow, I'll have no roof over me head.
I'm losin' this place for the want of me rent.
- I'll get you the rent.
- Oh, I don't want you to bother about it.
I'll get you more than the rent.
I'll get you money, power, the chance to hurt people the way they've hurt you.
Just you wait till tonight.
You'd be laughing through to the other side of your whiskers, Tom Meadow, if you'd seen what I seen.
And what might that be, Jem Yarrow?
I seen him myself last night on the road.
A suit of clothes walking, and a hat.
And he hadn't got no head nor hands.
I'm sorry. I thought you came in ahead of me.
Well, I didn't. There you are.
I wish you wouldn't move around so much. I can't tell where you are.
Lead the way, will you? Then I can't trip.
Thank you.
Hello, Herbert. Hello, Will.
Hey, Herbert. Here. Huh?
Yes? Ain't you afeared to be out at night, walking streets alone? Alone?
What makes you thinks I'm alone? Ow!
Oh, dear. Oh, 'struth. Oh, my arm.
Must have a touch of gout. Gout?
Yes. Oh, drinkin' too much port, no doubt.
Hello, Herbie. Hello, hello.
A half a pint of bitters, will you? Half a pint of bitters.
Yeah. Oh, Herbert.
Yes? On your way over to the thickets, did you see anything of a headless corpse?
A headless corpse?
Yes! L... Oh.
Oh, no, no, no. That's just imagination. Oh, imagination.
There be no such thing as a headless corpse.
Oh, don't believe it, eh?
Well, chap from London believes... and asked me all about it.
And me too. He wrote about it, he did.
Making game here, that's what he was doing.
Oh. Well, tell him to his face. Yonder he's coming.
How are you, Bill? Hi,
Meadows. Hello, Mr. Foster.
Hello. How are you? Spot of brandy, please, Maud.
Did you find the postmistress, Mr. Foster?
Yes, thanks. She opened up the post office, and I got my story to London.
Sending off a story, Mr. Foster? I thought you was up here for a holiday.
Well, I couldn't pass up a story about an invisible man.
Why, it's better than the monster of Loch Ness.
Well... Say, that's funny.
Accidents will happen.
I didn't even touch it.
Oh, you must have. There.
Think nothing of it.
I wish I was home.
Mr. Foster. Yes, Gray?
Excuse me, sir. Miss Julie says there won't be an answer.
All right. Thank you, sir.
She's not for you, Foster.
Who said that?
Not me, not me. I said nothing.
That's funny. I must be hearing things.
It's getting so I'm believing my own stories.
Well, cheerio.
Good night, all. Good night.
That does it.
Two half-and-halfs and a pint of bitters.
There you are, Neddy. Yours, if you want it.
Where's a chap can play a game with me and make it worth my while?
I'll play you, Ned Towle.
You will, will you?
Whatever gave you notion you can throw a dart?
Oh, I didn't...
Oh, it's one of me hidden talents.
There you are, then. Eh? Oh, now, thank you.
Well, I-I... I don't think these points are sharp enough.
You know? You don't, eh?
No. Get on with it.
You couldn't hit a barn door with a dead cat.
Oh, I can't?
I could... No.
I'll bet you five quid. Five quid?
And where would he get five quid? Yeah, where would he?
I got it right here somewhere. I got a draft.
Here. Here's a draft right there for five pounds.
Right? Right-o.
Five pounds? Yes. Where's yours?
I never made five pounds so easy. All right, put up, put up.
Here's mine. Here, you hold it.
Who's gonna hold him?
I don't need no holding.
All right. But hang around.
Rob, Rob? What do you want?
What'll I do? Just go through the motions. I'll take care of it.
Come on, throw it, throw it!
All right, all right.
Give me a chance, will ya?
You ain't afraid, are you? Afraid, nothing.
Well, go on and throw it! All right.
The first is a bit of a fancy one, you know?
Bloomin' bull's-eye.
'Tis naught but bull luck.
Look. Any position.
Well, why didn't you throw it?
Rob, what's the matter?
Give me time to get back, will you?
I've got to run with it and stick it in the board. Oh.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. This is Herbert Higgins's delayed dart.
Watch the bull's-eye.
I didn't think he could do it. Strike me pink.
Another blinking bull's-eye!
I know, I know. I don't even have to look.
Here, watch this one.
All the way around me napper.
It's bleedin' hypnotism, that's what it is.
Oh, hypnotism, eh?
Ah, get him. Here.
I resent that remark. I'm a honest man, I am.
Oh, yes? Let's see them darts.
What's the matter? A dart's a dart, ain't it?
They're all the same, Neddy. There you are.
Now are you satisfied? Why, yes, I...
Well, all right. You wanna bet another five pounds? Well, n...
Come on, talk fast. Well, no, I...
I'll be satisfied with the five quid I'm gonna win.
You hopes.
Horace, loan me your "to-and-fro. "
Thank you. Hey, Jem, here, here.
Come on, give me an hand.
Come on, Jem, come on.
What now? Put one of those harrows on there.
Right on. Come on, right on top of there.
There you are. Now stand back, stand back.
Look out for your head.
Here you are, Horace. Thank you.
He never had a dart in his hand before. Blooming magic.
You're going to have an hard job beating that one. Don't worry about me.
It's your throw, Neddy.
Yes, here's your darts.
Six of them!
- I won't throw against that.
- Then it's his money.
Right. Thank you. That's right. Pay him off.
Good night. Good night.
It's a blasted trick!
No, you don't.
Give me back me money. Oh, why, are you threatening me?
You heard me. I won it fair.
Give it back! You thievin' blackguard.
Thievin' blackguard, eh? I didn't say nothing.
You'll say less with a bashed head.
Now get your money.
Get your money!
Anyone else? No!
I thought not.
Miss Julie. Now, Julie, no nonsense.
There, that's a good girl. How tiresome of me.
I'm all right now. I must get back to Mother.
Now, Miss Julie, you've had no rest, and you haven't had a mouthful to eat since breakfast.
Oh, don't be such an old fusspot, Cleghorn.
Julie, why can't the nurses... No, they can't.
She doesn't feel safe unless I'm there.
Safe from what, dear? I don't know.
She lies there babbling about invisible men... and... and griffins.
Griffins? Yes.
It's all part of her delirium.
Griffins.
Tell me, Julie. Did you ever know a man by the name of Griffin?
Not me, but... Mother and Dad did.
But he's dead. Miss Herrick, please!
- Yes, nurse? Does she want me?
- We can't quieten her.
You should have called me. Wait, Julie, I...
I'll talk to you later, Mark. But, Julie.
Mr. Foster?
Mr. Foster, it's on my mind.
SirJasper told me not to talk.
But seeing how you and Miss
Julie... What is it, Cleghorn?
A man named Griffin was here two days ago.
Are you all right? Quite. But it was closer than I like 'em.
What was that?
Keep quiet.
Get back in the library.
What is it now? What do you want?
Get rid of Mark Foster. Pack him off.
I won't have him nearJulie. But it's no use, Rob. She's in love with him.
Doesn't she love you? I can ruin you, remember? Disgrace you.
Go ahead, then. Do what you want to me.
How could Julie marry you? Why, you're inhuman!
She's for me, I tell you. For me.
I'll kill Foster before
I'll let him have her.
But you're... you're horrible. No woman...
You mean because I'm invisible? Yes, yes, that's it.
If I weren't invisible, you'd do your best for me, wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you?
Yes. Yes, of course I would.
Then I'll be visible again.
I'll be back, Jasper, to hold you to your promise.
Lie still, Brutus.
I wouldn't hurt you, you old fool. You know I wouldn't hurt you.
Steady, boy.
That's a good dog. A very good dog.
That's a boy. Just as good as new, aren't you? Hmm?
Feel pretty good, do you?
There we go. One more and that's all.
Didn't hurt a bit, did it? Huh?
Didn't hurt at all. I told you it wouldn't.
Up you go.
Well, you're just as good as you ever were, aren't you?
Down you go. Out you go.
Come on, boy. Come here.
Been a pretty good dog, haven't you? Helped your old master a lot.
We did a goodjob together. No one will know anything ever happened to you.
So you've come back. Yes, I've come back.
I knew you would. I knew you'd have to.
You're going to make me visible again.
No, that's not possible.
Don't lie to me. I saw you make that dog visible.
That was a transfusion from another dog.
Every drop of his blood. Well?
The dog I took it from died. What of it?
Don't you see? To make you visible,
I'd have to drain the blood of a man.
What of it? That would be murder.
Who cares? Look here, Griffin.
You might not stay visible.
It wouldn't last. A day, an hour. You'd probably fade again.
You're lying! It's the truth.
Down, Brutus.
Leave that dog alone! Don't try any tricks.
We're going to make that blood transfusion tonight.
I know the very man, nosy young fool of a reporter.
Mark Foster's his name, at the Birchester Inn.
Call him and tell him you've got the invisible man here.
He'll come like a shot. Go on. Call him up!
Go on. Do it!
I won't do it. I'm a scientist, not a murderer.
Would you rather I took your blood?
I'll call him.
Operator... get me 117.
Make it sound convincing.
Are you there? I would like to speak with Mr. Mark Foster.
Here, hold on, hold on.
What's all this about?
Oh, hello, Foster. This is Dr. Drury speaking... from the old stone house in Thrustlewood.
Listen carefully. I've got the invisible man. It's a matter of life and death.
Invisible man, me eye.
Whose life is he threatening now, may I ask?
Mine, if he should break loose.
I've got him right here, caught.
Yes, Dr. Drury. Come at once.
All right, sir. We'll be over presently.
He's coming. Good.
I'll have a spot of whiskey.
I'll take it.
- Yes?
- Is this Dr. Drury?
- Yes, this is Dr. Drury.
- Birchester Police calling.
Just checking on a call that just came in from you.
Never mind it. No. No, I didn't call.
Oh, you didn't, eh?
You asked for it, Drury.
I'll have to take your blood.
Good evening, Sergeant.
How are you, Constable?
Good evening, sir. What can we do for you?
There's no hurry. Take your time.
We won't be but a moment, sir. Do you mind if I watch?
Not at all. Make yourself right at home, sir.
Six. Fifteen for two.
Ahh.
That does it. Well, sir, what can we do for you?
I just dropped in to see if you picked up any more yarns about the invisible man.
Chap just called in, said he'd caught the invisible man, he did.
Caught the inv... That's what he said.
He was making game of us, he was. But he asked for you. Did you check the call?
Yes. An old quack doctor out
Thrustlewood way. Drury was his name.
A quack in the head, he is. Makes all manner of unholy experiments.
Experiments, did you say? Huh?
Come on, Constable. We're going out there.
Look. Can't you make this thing go any faster?
I'm exceeding the speed limit now.
You lied to me, Drury.
I'm as good as ever. See?
I'm going to stay this way as long as there's blood to be had.
Right around the next turn.
Rob. Rob Griffin.
My name is Field, understand?
You've been expecting me.
I've come to make you a nice, long visit.
But you've become... Yes, as you advised. I'm visible again.
I'm sorry, SirJasper, but
I'd retired as you suggested.
That's all right, Cleghorn.
You look as if you think you know me. Well, I-I...
Set him right, Jasper!
This is Mr. Field, Cleghorn.
Mr. Field? Martin Field.
And I expect to be here for quite some time.
I know what you're thinking. You're thinking how easy it would be to turn me in.
Don't try it, Jasper. I can make myself invisible whenever I please.
Look here, I never meant... I didn't dream...
I came here to take possession.
Now give me your keys.
Keys? Yes.
That's it. I'll go and come at will.
I'm visible again, and
I've come back forJulie.
Rob.
Rob, for pity's sake, you...
And nothing can stop me.
Come in.
- Hello, Rob.
- Shut the door.
Ah, yes.
Well, it is a pleasure to see you.
And to be able to see you, that's the nice thing about it.
How did you know I was here?
I heard Alf Prouty talking about the bloke he sent down here last night.
It was right after the Drury fire, you know.
So I said to myself, "Oh, that must be me friend Rob Griffin come back to life. "
The name is Field. Martin
Field. Well, whatever it is.
Well, I am pleased to see you're living in a nice home like this, eh?
What, oh! Ooh! How do you do?
Say, you know, we ought to be as cozy as a couple of bugs in a rug...
now that our troubles are over. Our trouble?
Mmm. Where do you come in?
Oh, Rob. I stuck by you when you were poor.
You don't think I'm going to desert you, now you're rich.
I'll give you 50 pounds and get out, understand?
Fifty pounds? Oh, what a shock.
And coming right on top of poor Dr. Drury... being killed by an unknown hand.
Well, unknown by most.
Put two and two together, have you?
Yes.
Would you like to know why Drury had to die? Yes.
I needed his blood to make me visible again. Oh, no!
But it won't last, Herbert.
I'm going to need more.
Oh, yes? Who can we get? I know!
Look... Hey! Here, don't look at me like that now.
I'm too small. I ain't got enough red "corpuskles"... in my blood to bait a mousetrap.
Well, what's the matter? What are you doing?
It's Drury's dog. Well, all right. So what?
Hey, you're trembling like a leaf, you know.
He's the only living thing I'm afraid of.
Afraid? You afraid? Oh, what an horrid thought.
Look at me, I ain't afraid. That dog?
Why, I'd take him by the tail, pull it out and hit him over the head with it.
You would? Yes. Why, I'd strangle him with me bare hands.
Then do it, strangle him, poison him, anything. I'll give you 500 pounds.
Oh, 500 pounds for a big job like that? Oh, Rob!
I'll give you a thousand if you kill him. A thousand.
Come here. Come here. Oh. Yes? Huh?
Take my coat. Let him smell it. He'll follow you anywhere.
Don't worry. I'll follow him.
The job is done.
Uh, you mean you want it done now?
Certainly I want it done now.
Mark, how dreadful!
And you say the house was completely burned to the ground?
Completely. There wasn't even a piece of glass to get fingerprints from.
You mean, there weren't any clues?
Not one, SirJasper. The murderer just sort of melted away.
Mark, stop being so literary. What do you mean just "melted away"?
Just that. I think the murderer was invisible.
Invisible? Who's invisible? Hello.
Hello, Julie. Hello, Field.
Will you have some lunch?
Yes, do. You hardly touched your breakfast.
Mark, this is my old friend Martin
Field. Mark Foster of the Courier.
Oh, yes. You're the chap who writes those, uh... spook stories, aren't you?
If you want to call them that, yes.
It's a good line. People love that sort of fantasy.
- It's not fantasy. It's true.
- Oh, come now, Mark.
I mean it. I've seen the invisible man.
Oh, Mark, how could you possibly see the invisible man?
I saw him, I heard him...
Stick to your guns. That's the spirit.
Will you take wine or beer, sir? Beer, Cleghorn.
Still, the idea offers some practical difficulties, doesn't it?
I mean, well, what would the invisible man eat?
Surely not filet of sole.
Spider webs, more likely.
Charming notion. Yes, isn't it?
Oh, and what would he drink?
Dew drops? Surely not beer.
I think he drinks blood. Mark.
- What makes you say that?
- Because Dr. Drury's body... was drained of every last drop of blood.
- How awful!
- If you'll excuse me.
Sounds a bit like Dracula, doesn't it?
I mean, that sort of thing is out of date.
A transfusion would be more to the point.
What for? Perhaps to become visible again.
Say, that's an idea. But why should he want to be visible?
Read your mythology, Miss Julie.
Even the gods want love.
And... And your invisible man,
let's say he has a need to enjoy what other men enjoy.
You know, you're better at this sort of thing than I am.
And then, the day of days, he finds out how to do it.
Blood. Human blood. That's deliberate murder.
Why not?
What man who is truly great would stop at that?
And there he is... visible again.
He has only to reach out and take what he wants.
But will he stay visible?
It's a joke on him if he found himself fading out, I mean, at some crucial moment.
There's always plenty of blood.
He can be visible or invisible.
Think of the power, the authority, the finality of his slightest wish.
Why... Why, a man like that could rock the world.
A knife slipped. L-I cut my hand.
Let me get you something.
No, thanks. L
- I'll dress it.
He's quite pale.
Oh! You gave me quite a start.
Indeed, you did.
- Oh, Norma.
- Yes, sir?
Ask Mr. Foster to come up at once, please. Yes, Mr. Field.
It's a purely personal matter. Speak to him when you're alone, will you?
Yes, indeed, sir.
Oh, Mr. Foster. Mr. Field would like to see you in his room.
Thank you, Norma.
Hello, Field. Are you here?
Hello, Field?
Hey, Field, are you down here?
I told you you'd find the invisible man down here.
You can't get away, Foster. You're locked in,
and we're all alone where nobody can hear us.
You want the lights out, eh?
So I can't see you. Well, it won't work.
Hey, that wasn't even close.
You haven't a chance, Foster.
It would be easy to kill you,
But I've got to have your blood.
The joke's on you, Foster.
Your blood will make me visible, and I'll marryJulie while... while you rot in your grave.
It's no use, Foster.
I'm still here. Give me that.
I'm closing in on you, Foster.
You haven't got a chance.
You don't know where I am.
You can't fight what you can't see.
I might be in back of you.
I might be at your side.
Or I might be in front of you!
Up you come now.
That's it. Just the way I want you.
There you are. It won't take long, and you'll never feel a thing.
Come on, give it here. Come on here with me.
Come 'ere! Come 'ere!
Hello, Travers. What brings you here? Listen, Herrick.
Alf Prouty here tells me he picked up a man last night near the scene of the murder.
Aye, and I set him right down slap here at this door.
Is that the truth, Herrick? Why, yes.
You... You see, an old friend of mine...
Herrick, we shall have to see him.
Of course. Certainly.
Oh, Cleghorn, will you ask
Mr. Field to come in here...
What were you doing with Dr.
Drury's dog? Nothing. Nothing.
What do you mean nothing? Mr.
Griffin, he was afraid of him.
Griffin? I mean, Mr. Field.
Yes, but Mr. Field is not in his room.
What? He's not? Come on, let's open this door.
He must be inside. Well, come on, then. Let's break it down.
We have nothing more to fear from the invisible man.
He's dead.
And judgment was passed on him... by a higher court than ours.
He's taken Foster's blood the same as he did Drury's.
But he's still alive. Come on, get him out of here. Come on, Foster.
And then? Well, sir, he says to me,
"I'll make you as rich as Gresis. "
But, oh, did that tempt me? Yes, it did.
Oh, no, sir, no, Sir Frederick.
I was then and I am now unsullied.
May I go now, sir? No, wait a moment.
I wonder how he learned to become invisible.
From that old crank Dr. Drury, of course.
Their secret died with them luckily. A couple oflunatics.
That's right, sir. Griffin was always talking about getting back at people.
Never entered his head the dog would have the same idea towards him.
I mean, on account of what happened to old man Drury.
From what Father said, his mind was, well, warped.
It must have been. Warped by imaginary wrongs.
A man fighting shadows.
He's to be pitied, really.
He probed too deeply in forbidden places.
What a man earns, he gets.
Nature has a strange way of paying him back...
in his own coin.
Extra! Oregon State invites Duke to Rose Bowl!
Extra!
Late edition!
Oregon State invites Duke to Rose Bowl.
What is he saying?
Oh, Oregon State face
Duke University football in a Rose Bowl.
An incident of great national importance.
Late edition!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
We should like to see some leather paper.
Certainly.
For business use or personal?
Personal.
Here's a handmade paper.
I have it in several different colors.
Now, let's see.
Hey, here we are.
- Got white, buff...
- White will do.
Very good, sir.
- Do you want your name on it?
- Yes, of course.
- Name?
- Frank Griffin.
- Griffin?
- Yes, Frank Griffin.
It should be familiar to you.
Should it?
It's your name.
Your real name.
Well, this ought to be cozy.
I'd just like to talk to you,
Mr. Griffin. Please be seated.
Surely.
Now, I tried to find you for many years.
Would you mind informing Mr. Griffin that it was I who found him?
Well, I'm flattered, gentlemen.
But what can I do for you?
We want to pay you.
Pay me?
Yes, Mr. Griffin, we want to pay you.
Yes, a fortune.
I'm sure you don't owe me anything, and nothing I have to offer is worth a fortune.
Oh, now, come, Mr. Griffin, there's no need for you to be modest, especially with us.
All we want to buy is your father's formula, or was it your uncle who discovered it?
No, no, no.
It was his grandfather, Frank Griffin.
Yes, yes, of course.
Frank Griffin Sr., shot by the police.
How fantastically romantic.
You know you could make a million with your grandfather's formula.
Now, look, gentlemen,
I'm not good at riddles and...
Your grandfather discovered a drug.
Injected into a man's bloodstream, it rendered him transparent.
Invisible.
People treated with this drug are sometimes dangerous.
They have to be liquidated.
But, if they are controlled, they can become very useful to any country at war.
You do have the drug in your possession,
Mr. Griffin, don't you?
I'm prepared to offer you any sum that you like to name.
But why come to me?
Oh, why make things difficult,
Mr. Griffin?
We came with the best of intentions.
But you're going to put us through great deal of unnecessary trouble.
Search the place.
Now, wait a minute.
What right have you to...
This right.
Very obstinate young man, huh?
What makes you think
I have this drug?
This shop, your false name.
Granted such a drug exists, do you think the world is ripe for such a discovery?
That is the common chatter of a man poisoned by the ideology of a decadent democracy.
Weapons are created to be used.
There's no place for the weak on this Earth.
- Typical German philosophy.
- Precisely.
German thinking is the clearest in the world.
As a graduate of Oxford,
I can testify to that.
It was German logic that led us to you.
Now, will you be kind enough to tell us where it is?
Or why don't we make him tell us?
Well, are we going to have to resort to force?
Oh, I see.
German logic.
If I did have such a drug, surely you don't think I'd keep it here.
You're not a very convincing liar,
Mr. Griffin.
Perhaps we can loosen your tongue.
Why, you...
This is really a very useful machine.
You know, if a person weren't careful, it could cut off his fingers or his whole hand.
Very handy machine, huh?
Handy, isn't it?
Take him over there!
Put his fingers in here.
Why, you...
Come, come, Mr. Griffin, while there's still time.
This won't help you much.
No?
The choice is yours.
Stop. I'll tell.
You were right.
Let me have it now.
Come.
Let him go.
I told you it was a very useful little machine.
Men who attacked you were foreign agents,
Mr. Raymond.
Or should I call you,
Mr. Griffin?
- I'd like to forget that name.
- I understand.
Since you're unwilling to let the Axis powers use your formula, will you consider submitting it to the American government?
Naturally, we've known about you for some time but respected your incognito.
However, since that's been exposed, we deem it a highly patriotic service if you would permit us to use the drug.
There's no use asking me.
I should have destroyed it years ago.
But if your country had great need for it, a critical emergency?
There will never be an emergency critical enough to justify its use.
Never.
May I present Mr. Raymond.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Raymond.
- Glad to know you. Glad to know you.
- Thanks.
Gentlemen, Mr. Raymond has decided to turn it over to us.
However, there is one condition.
The drug is to be used by no one but myself.
But, Mr. Raymond, we have men of experience who have been chosen for just such a task.
Does Mr. Raymond realize the danger of this mission?
And are you, gentlemen, fully aware of the danger in using this drug?
I'm the only one who knows its potency.
It may cost the life of the man who uses it.
It's true I may not have the experience, but I won't come back without the information you want.
Sometime ago,
I refused you the use this drug.
Well, now I offer not only the drug but myself.
Together, we will bring back what you want.
- But Mr. Raymond, you...
- A man of conviction is often more to be desired than a man of experience.
I should like to think it over.
There's no time for that.
We must make a decision immediately.
I'm inclined to think
Mr. Raymond is equal to the task.
You have my confidence, sir.
Gentlemen, I move to assign the job to Mr. Raymond.
Well, gentlemen?
- I agree.
- Go ahead.
Thank you.
Now, tell me what I have to do.
We know the enemy is planning a nationwide sabotage effort, an all-out attempt to wreck this country's war productions.
It is imperative to all of us to know the exact date when Germany will strike.
- By what means.
- And through what agents.
And who would have this necessary information?
Hitler and the Gestapo, the Secret Police.
Well, we've no time to lose.
Speed is essential.
- I'm ready to go now.
- Excellent.
Well, we shall carry you to London and then to Berlin.
We'll be over Berlin in a minute, old boy.
Now, all I have to do is get in touch with our agents there.
Arnold Schmidt, carpenter.
Gärtner Strasse 22, right?
Tell him you want to buy a coffin, empire style.
Altitude 4,005.
- Where is he?
- In the barn, you fool.
Come out, or I'll shoot!
No use hiding!
Come out of there!
Come out!
You can't get away!
Surround the barn.
- He lost his shoe, sir.
- I find this shoe, sir.
- He can't go far without his shoes.
- I find this, sir.
He can't get far without his...
He can't get far!
We couldn't find him, sir.
- He's gone, sir.
- He disappeared.
Are you crazy?
- We saw him...
- And then we didn't.
He dissolved in the air.
You are crazy!
Go back and report there is a British parachutist at large.
Ask them to send a company of men.
We must search the countryside.
I want to order a coffin, empire style.
Where are you?
Over here, but I'm practically frozen.
This is...
This is amazing.
Well, they told me to expect an invisible man, but this is like a...
Like a miracle.
How about some hot coffee, huh?
Oh, if I can be...
May I have another?
Sure, sure, sure.
It's... It's amazing.
Oh, you will be of great help to us.
Maybe. We'll see.
Now, where do we start?
There is a young lady at Wannsee, Park Strasse 9.
She knows the right people.
Make all your reports to me,
- and I'll see that they get to England.
- Mmm-hmm.
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.
Just the girl's name.
Maria.
Remember to give her the password.
You have the address?
Wannsee,
Park Strasse 9.
How far is it?
Uh, about 70 kilometers.
Hmm. That calls for transportation.
Have you got any around here?
Usually there is a cab in front of the restaurant across the street.
Good.
Will you please send a taxi to Wannsee, Park Strasse 9?
Park Strasse 9 in Wannsee.
Yeah, yeah.
For you, Emil.
Park Strasse 9 in Wannsee.
Uh, here. Take over.
Play like you were losing your own money.
The taxi you ordered.
Taxi? We didn't order a taxi.
I got a call to come out here.
I'll ask Ms. Sorenson.
Just a minute.
Come in, Gretl.
There's a taxi cab driver out here, ma'am.
He said somebody telephoned him to come here.
I certainly didn't.
It must have been a mistake.
That's what I told him.
Who is that?
Don't be alarmed.
You can't see me, so I thought it only fair to switch off the light.
It puts us on equal terms.
Where are you?
Right here in the room with you.
- Oh.
- Don't go.
Then show yourself.
If I could, you'd be surprised.
Mind if I smoke?
My first cigarette in days.
Oh, forgive me. I didn't realize the winters in Germany were so severe.
They told me
I'd find help here.
This is ridiculous.
Now, if this is a practical joke,
I don't consider it at all funny.
Well, now, wait a minute.
I was sent here in empire style.
Empire style?
Oh, really?
This is fantastic.
Probably, but the explanation is simple.
You see, I have a certain chemical in my veins.
Well, it takes the color out of my whole body.
Are you insane?
No, just transparent.
You wouldn't call a window insane, would you?
Just believe me.
I'm simply invisible.
Otherwise, I'm like any other normal human being.
How can I help you?
Well, by putting me in contact with a source of certain information.
Who are you?
My name is Raymond,
Frank Raymond.
Oh, yes.
I've been 36 hours getting here, and I'm tired and dirty.
Do you mind if I use your tub?
Really I wish you'd choose another time.
- Why?
- It's dangerous.
I'm expecting a guest for dinner.
Someone interesting?
Oberst Heiser of the Secret Police.
Excellent.
You work fast, don't you?
I'm sure you'll find the gentleman extremely interesting.
A bath and a tenderloin steak.
Those are the high points of a man's life.
Quite charming.
Three people having dinner for two.
Yes, three on a steak.
Here he comes.
Be there in a minute.
Good evening, Karl.
You are looking magnificent.
Thank you.
I...
I couldn't wait to be with you...
Alone.
No, Karl.
I feel much safer with him to chaperone us.
You ought to forget about him, Maria.
Oh, Karl.
Missions like his take time.
Sometimes, a lifetime.
He never told me why he left.
Oh, he never told anyone.
He has his own ideas.
And that's dangerous.
The Führer doesn't like people who think their own thoughts.
I hope you will be satisfied with what my cook has to offer.
Think nothing of it.
I brought a little snack from my meager rations.
- Cheese.
- From Holland.
- Champagne.
- From Occupied France.
Moët & Chandon, 1929.
Fowl from Denmark...
Oh. and lobster from Norway.
Delicious.
Oh.
Every country we conquer feeds us.
And these are just a few of the good things we'll have when this war is over.
- Caviar.
- From Russia.
Very difficult to get.
Slaves working for us everywhere while we sit back with a fork in our hands and a whip on our knees.
Oh.
That's strange.
Very strange.
Um...
Sorry, Karl,
I couldn't wait.
- More champagne, please.
- Of course.
Now, let's drink to the golden age of the German Reich.
To the people who are bound to win the war.
Not chilled enough.
Excuse me.
Guard.
- Bring a wine bucket.
- Heil Hitler.
Frank. Shh.
- How do you like him?
- Who?
Your new bodyguard.
I'd feel better if you'd accept his protection.
Why, Karl, I...
I never realized
I was in danger.
Beautiful women are always in danger.
- Oh.
- Always.
Yes, always.
Shall we...
- Yes?
- ...eat?
Of course.
Oh. I forgot the jam.
Now, let's see.
Where did I put that?
Plum, apple,
- strawberry.
- Ah, here it is.
Specially prepared for me.
Gooseberry.
Oh. Place it over there.
And I don't want to be disturbed under any circumstances.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil.
I was...
That's strange.
I was sure you had put some chicken on my plate.
Maybe you'd eaten it already.
Oh, have I?
I really mustn't eat so fast.
I'll give you some more.
That wing.
It really looks delicious.
Yes, and some potatoes.
Mmm-hmm.
That's fine.
That will be enough for a while.
You know, I'm overworked.
A three-hour conference with the Führer nearly killed me.
Now, Karl, don't tell me the Führer conferred with you personally.
Of course, he did.
If you had said he had conference with Göring or Ribbentrop,
I might believe you, but not...
But I tell you the Führer called me in himself just before he left for the eastern front.
He gave me secret orders.
Nobody there.
Just him and me.
Oh, let's forget about politics.
But I tell you it's true.
He's ordered an attack upon the United States.
How can we attack the United States 4,000 miles away?
To the Führer, no place is too far away, not even the United States.
He's even fixed the date.
- The date?
- Mmm-hmm.
Really? When?
Let's forget politics.
Some day, you'll be the most important man in the party.
You have the strengths of Göring, the vitality of Goebbels, and the shrewdness of Hess.
I wouldn't be surprised if you became the Führer's successor.
Well, if you're so sure of my future, why don't you...
Why don't you have some lobster?
You've hardly eaten anything.
I cannot understand why Stauffer ever let the Gestapo train you for such risky work as spying, flying planes, shooting guns, intelligence work.
No, that's not work for a beautiful girl.
I'd never send you on such dangerous missions.
I'd keep you with me always.
Maria, you set my blood afire...
I must have pushed it with my foot.
Too bad.
- It will dry.
- Huh?
Come on. Sit down, and eat your lobster.
Oh, well.
Maria, why...
Why don't you forget about Stauffer?
After all, there's such a thing as carrying loyalty too far.
Oh.
You hurt yourself.
Something pushed my hand.
Poor Karl, trying to eat with his nose.
Poor darling.
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Oh.
Maria, I...
You don't have to laugh.
I really don't understand.
If you had a brain in your head, you'd stop that silly giggling!
Did you hurt yourself?
This is an insult to the entire Nazi party.
But, Karl, I was only laughing at your tricks.
Laughing, eh?
I've had people shot for less.
- Guard!
- Oh, but...
Ms. Sorenson, consider yourself under house arrest.
This woman is not to leave the house.
So be on the watch.
For what, sir?
I don't know, but watch her.
But, Karl...
You messed up everything.
I'm sorry.
Too much champagne on an empty stomach.
He was just going to give us the information we wanted when you started...
Well, he was getting far too familiar with you.
But we can't let our personal feelings interfere.
A whole year's work destroyed in a few minutes.
What are we going to do now?
You'll just have to turn on the charm again, darling.
And if I'm any judge of men, he'll be calling on you soon.
What makes you think that?
Well, you're an irresistible woman.
- Who is it?
- Open up!
Open the door, or we bring it down!
Don't you dare come into my bedroom.
You better let them in.
What do you want?
- Who were you talking to?
- Myself.
Now, get out of here, or I'll report you to Oberst Heiser.
That was a man's voice we heard.
- How dare you?
- Oh.
- Why, you...
- Fritz!
Let her alone.
- She kicked me in the stomach.
- Come on.
Remember, she's Stauffer's friend and Heiser's.
Oh, don't let them get you down.
They treat women like dogs.
I hate them.
Forgive me.
Oh, I wish I could see you.
Very well, then you shall see me.
I'll have to use some of the things on your dressing table.
- Do you mind?
- Please do.
Ah, this ought to help.
Oh, you are rather tall, aren't you?
Six, one-and-a-half, when I get my head on.
I could sure use a towel.
In the right-hand drawer.
I could use these, too.
Is it all right?
- Surely. Go ahead.
- Thanks.
I've seen women do this somewhere.
Remember now,
I look better invisible.
Oh, you're in for a shock.
Oh.
I warned you.
Well, how do you like your invisible man with a cold cream face?
Have you always been invisible, or will the drug wear off?
It might in time.
Oh, but it's such a powerful drug.
Isn't there danger in using it?
Under the present circumstances, there's danger in not using it.
I'm tired.
This drug puts you to sleep at the most unpredictable times.
Oh, if I could only close my eyes for a few minutes.
Frank. Frank, you mustn't fall asleep here.
It's dangerous.
Yes, I know, but it feels so nice, just like drifting.
- Frank, please don't.
- Shh.
I won't make a sound.
Just a little nap.
Frank. Frank!
Come in, Heiser.
Come in, and close the door.
I... I'm delighted to see you back, sir.
I can imagine.
"Countryside search for parachutist is not yet found.
"Clothes discovered, but his description not available.
"Questioning of searchers revealed nothing.
"Eyewitnesses claim they saw the parachutist dissolve in mid-air."
What do you make of that?
I've had the officers in charge arrested.
They'll be tried in military court, of course.
It's clearly nothing, but incompetence.
Baron Ikito, may I present to you Lieutenant Heiser.
- Heil Hitler!
- Huh? Oh. Heil Hitler.
Baron, we have a long trip behind us.
Yes, it was a long trip.
I'm sure you must want to rest.
As the rising sun never sets, so we servants never sleep.
Forgive me, but I have a call to pay, uh, a private call.
I quite understand, sir.
Having looked at nothing but the skies, the waters, and me, your appetite for privacy no doubt is on edge.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
What have you done to your uniform?
Oh, I...
I was with Ms. Sorenson, having dinner.
Dinner?
Did you eat it, or bathe in it?
I really don't know what happened, sir.
The food seemed to creep up on me.
Really? The first time you interest me.
What interfered with your gastronomic pleasure?
I... I couldn't say, sir.
There I was, behind the table, and suddenly it began to...
Frank. Frank, please wake up.
Frank.
Conrad, you're back.
The warmth of your welcome overwhelms me.
What's been going on between you and Heiser?
I resent you storming into my bedroom, and I resent your question.
Will you both leave at once?
This modest indignation does not suit you, Maria.
You dined with him, didn't you?
You told me to take care of her, and I have.
Like a father.
You appear to take liberal views as to the duties of a father.
I'm a loyal party member, and I won't be treated in this fashion.
The Führer himself gave me his orders.
So you already wormed your way up there?
Fast work.
A little too fast.
I only did my duty.
I read the reports on you.
I know every move that you made while I was away.
You tried to get my job.
You even tried to squeeze me out here.
- You misunderstand, sir.
- I understand you only too well.
At least you didn't get my job.
- But really, sir, I...
- Your hopes were premature.
You are an enemy of the party, Heiser!
Guard.
This man is under arrest.
Take him to the Stasi prison.
Why did you have to arrest him here?
Did you need me as a witness?
It's good for you to see your friends arrested.
Hardens you.
There's no place in our new order for sentimentalists.
Do you really think
I could be sentimental about Heiser?
He hasn't been loyal to anyone.
He's ripe for an accident.
Perhaps a sudden attack of appendicitis, and he might not recover from the operation.
Conrad, people aren't going to be taken in forever by these operations where the patient always dies.
Darling, you don't know how ill my patients really are.
As a matter of fact, you're looking rather pale yourself.
Don't expose yourself.
You might catch something fatal.
Is that all?
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you.
I must get back to my office.
Ribbentrop is sending me a file of secret orders in connection with our work in the United States, in which you play an important part.
Thank you.
I'll do my best.
I'm sure you will.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Frank.
Frank.
Where are you, Frank?
No jokes, please, Frank.
Good morning.
Don't hide, Mr. Griffin.
Won't you do any good.
I saw you holding that book.
You don't waste your time.
Shall I call the guards in now, or can we talk this over like gentlemen?
Why, Mr. Stauffer.
Four stories high, no fire escape.
I wouldn't jump if I were you.
You might break every invisible bone in that poor invisible body.
You are a very clever man, Mr. Stauffer.
Uh-huh.
Now, I think we can come to an understanding, or shall I turn on the heat as you say in your country?
That's a very good idea.
It is rather cool.
Will you do me a favor?
Sit down and rock.
I shall feel safer if I know you're not standing behind me.
Oh, by the way, that book that you were reading just now is a list of the German-Japanese agents in the United States.
You walked right into our trap.
"Our trap"?
When I told Maria about the secret papers in my office,
I knew that you were there.
I felt sure that you'd snap at the bait.
Keep rocking.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
- Or a drink perhaps?
- No, thank you.
Now, Mr. Griffin, since you are in no position to bargain,
I suggest that you hand over that formula.
We'll make it well worth your while.
Money doesn't interest me.
My living expenses have dropped to nothing lately.
No, I wasn't thinking about money.
I'll let you keep what you already have.
Your life.
Keep rocking.
Unfortunately,
I can't oblige you about the drug.
I don't know the formula myself.
Very well then.
You force me to use methods that I had hoped to avoid.
Is this where we stop being gentlemen?
Guard!
Hurry.
Oh! You...
Hurry. Hurry!
Guards! Guards!
Guards, stop him!
Don't let him get away.
Help! Help!
Send the fire department.
Guard that door.
Guards!
Now, steady, men.
Watch him.
Careful.
Steady, now.
Don't let him get away.
Look out!
Get up, you stupid fools.
Now, don't let him get away.
Mind that corner.
Steady.
Look out!
Is this the coffin
I ordered empire style?
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
You've got to radio this to England at once.
What's that?
The German-Japanese agents in America?
Right, and now I know where to get the information we're really after.
Every second counts.
I had better send this at once.
Mmm-mmm! Boy, this is spooky. Wow.
Hello.
Hello.
This is the man with the cold cream.
I just wanted to know if you were still interested.
Of course,
I'm still interested.
More than ever, but you needn't bring it.
I'll come take it myself.
We deliver free of charge, you know.
Who is it?
The Führer.
- Heil, Hitler.
- Heil.
No, no, that's not it.
The brown leather binding. You must find it.
I happened to hear about your friend
I came to express my regrets.
Thank you, Baron.
Allow me to congratulate you on the speed of your news service, Baron.
One minute sooner, and you'd beaten the fire engines.
And perhaps caught Griffin.
Tell me, sir, that book listing our agents in the United States
- is still in your possession, of course?
- Of course.
You see, when you asked me to let you have that book, you promised to guard it with your life.
And you know, of course, that should the names of so many of our loyal agents fall into the wrong hands, it would cost me my life.
Really? How interesting.
Your life?
Certainly. In my country, when a man makes a mistake...
Uh, would you mind showing me that book?
As only one copy exists, its safekeeping would comfort me.
Unfortunately, other people's comfort is not my strong suit, Baron.
Oh.
May I remind you that though we are Axis partners, you are still on German soil.
Our code demands that we do only what we consider best for our own welfare.
I see. And at the moment, my welfare is not related to yours.
You are very discerning, Baron.
I cannot allow my judgment to be influenced by consideration of your welfare.
That is your decision?
I'm sure that you won't mind my informing the Japanese government about your unique handling of our affairs.
Do what you like, Ikito.
But you are still in Germany.
I've never been more aware of it.
Yes?
A number on Gärtner Strasse just called Ms. Sorenson's house.
Gärtner Strasse?
- A man selling cold cream.
- Cold cream?
Give me Gestapo headquarters.
Pig's fat.
Just the dish for this pig.
He's been stuffing himself with caviar long enough.
Get up!
Get up when you're spoken to, swine!
Attention!
Here's your food.
I'm not hungry.
Because it isn't lobster?
Eat it!
Eat it!
How do you like it?
That's what we get on our ration cards.
You're only getting what you deserve, Heiser.
Who's that?
What? Where are you?
You've sent thousands of innocent people into these rat holes.
Now you're in one yourself.
In a few hours, you'll be shot.
You know how it'll happen.
Exactly how.
You've given the order yourself too often.
Guard!
Guard!
What do you want?
There...
There's somebody in my cell.
You...
But... But I heard a voice.
They all do in this place.
You won't be hearing it long.
Did you think those murders would help you?
You're as good as dead, Heiser.
I'm losing my mind.
Most of your victims were driven insane before they died.
- The way you'll die tonight.
- Stop. Stop it!
You're going to die, Heiser.
You're going to pay for just one of the crimes you've committed in the name of your party to cover up your own greed and brutality.
Your kind just doesn't kill men.
You murder their spirit.
You strangle their last breath of hope and freedom so that you, the chosen few, can rule your slaves in ease and luxury.
You're a sadist just like others, Heiser, with no resource but violence and no feeling but fear, the kind you're feeling now.
You're drowning, Heiser, drowning in the ocean of blood around this barren little island you call a new order.
One of your own gang pushed you off.
Someone else will push him off.
And that's how you'll all go, killing your own.
Dog eating dog until only the biggest and the hungriest are left.
You were a little dog, Heiser, and they're pretending you're mad so they can shoot you tonight.
Who are you?
I can't see you.
I'm right beside you.
Where? Where?
Right here, in your cell.
In my cell?
That's impossible.
I can't see you.
But I can see you quite clearly.
You're touching your forehead.
Now, you're loosening your collar.
Yes, I can see and hear everything you do.
I can go wherever I please without restriction.
And if I want to,
I can even free you.
Free me?
Please, please.
I don't want to die.
Get me out of here.
Get me out of here, and I'll do anything.
Anything.
All you have to do is answer one question.
Just ask me. Please, ask me anything.
What are the plans for attack on America?
Well, I'll tell you.
We're sending bombing planes over New York, all suicide squad, while our agents will sabotage
American industry.
At the same time, they will destroy public utilities.
Well, that's a pretty big job.
Oh, we've been preparing for years.
Yes. They only await the word.
Now, now I've told you, now get me out of here.
You promised, you know, to take me out of here.
What is the date of the attack on New York?
Uh,
I'll tell you that as soon as I'm free.
You'd better speak up now.
I'll tell you, I'll swear, but not before...
You'd leave me here,
I know.
You, Nazis.
I pity the devil when you boys start arriving in bunches.
Guard, the key to open Heiser's cell.
Stay here.
- They're coming.
- The date, Heiser.
- They're coming to kill me.
- The date, Heiser.
Tonight.
It starts tonight.
A hundred bombers leave from Tempelhof for New York.
Save me.
Save me. I'll tell you everything about our whole spy network.
Do you hear me?
Save my life.
You can't let me die.
You need me.
What's he yelling about?
What are you doing, Heiser?
- Broadcasting to England?
- No. No, don't shoot. I...
I have something to tell you.
Save your breath, Heiser.
We know enough already.
Hurry up.
Put on his overcoat.
Come on.
We've got to move.
I thought you wanted to get out of here.
Turn up your collar.
Come on.
I'll take the gun.
We'll be at the airport in 20 minutes.
I've got to make a stop first.
22 Gärtner Strasse.
We can't. I've got to get out of this country before Stauffer catches up with me.
And be shot down by the British? Oh, no.
We'll radio them first that we're coming over in a German plane.
Oh.
Escaping from the Gestapo so that I can get killed by the RAF.
What a joke.
Well, I've got to get out of these clothes.
And you still don't remember who talked in your telephone?
Answer me!
I didn't see anyone come into my shop.
That's precisely what I've been waiting for.
Precisely.
I believe you.
And the short-wave radio set in your chimney, of course, you'd know nothing about that.
Dozens of people live in that place.
I'm... I am a carpenter.
I don't know anything about the radios.
Of course.
The car back there.
Secret police.
They're watching that Schmidt place.
Wait right here.
Schmidt. Schmidt.
- Frank.
- Maria.
- Where is Schmidt?
- I don't know.
What are you doing here?
The Gestapo was listening when you telephoned.
The wires were tapped.
Oh, I get it.
You double-crossed him, and now you'd like to get me.
You're playing both sides.
Spying for the Nazis and pretending to be our friend.
No. I came to warn you.
To lay another trap, as you did with the help of Stauffer.
Your role is quite obvious.
Oh, Frank, how can you talk like this?
Well, they won't get me.
- But, Frank...
- Stay where you are.
I've got to get out of here.
Don't leave me.
Take me with you to England.
How did you know
I was going to England?
- I didn't, but...
- So the trap was all set, eh?
Oh, Frank, how can you talk like that?
If I weren't on your side, would I be here?
I'm not so sure.
Frank, please try to understand.
Oh! What's this?
It's full of hooks.
Oh, they're tearing into me.
- Why?
- Frank.
Oh, can't move.
No, don't touch me.
- You'll make the hooks go deeper.
- Oh.
- Oh, I knew you told them.
- No! I didn't!
Here.
Did you see those Japs go into the shop?
No, why do you suppose?
Let's find out.
You follow the hearse.
She's gone. She must have been in one of those coffins.
What about the second coffin?
Who would they have in that?
There's no telling.
Psst.
Where are you?
Come out.
There's nobody here.
I... I can't leave without you.
You've got to notify the British we're coming, or they'll shoot our plane down.
Where are you?
Sign this.
What is it?
Our common form of release.
It merely states that you've been well treated, and no one has harmed you.
- I can't sign it.
- You won't?
I can't.
You've broken my fingers.
You...
Hello.
- For you, sir.
- Take him away.
Yes.
Listen, Stauffer, this is Heiser.
I've got to talk to you.
It's a matter of life or death.
It's Heiser. Trace this call.
I'll keep him talking.
Wait. Track him down and shoot him on sight.
My dear fellow, it's good to know that you're safe.
There's been a frightful mistake.
Stop fencing, Stauffer.
I'm leaving right now, so there's no use sending your killers here.
Heiser, pull yourself together.
I'm not sending anybody after you. I give you my word.
Oh, stop lying.
There's more at stake than our personal grudge the Fatherland is in danger.
Now listen.
There's an enemy spy at large, an invisible man.
An invisible man?
Where is he?
Will you give me your word as a national socialist that you'll reinstate me if I tell you?
Of course. You proved your value.
The Fatherland needs you.
Where is this invisible man?
Meet me at the corner of Wilhelm Strasse and Koch Strasse.
It's important, Doctor, that our prized fish here doesn't die.
Not yet.
He will not die, Baron.
Not from fishhooks.
Cut the rest away.
- Naturally, he has lost some blood.
- Oh, naturally.
But we can remedy that.
Fascinating.
What on earth could it be that makes him invisible?
Our chemist will know the answer soon.
- What have you done to that girl?
- Look, look, look.
So happy to hear you speak again, Mr. Griffin.
I can't tell you Japs apart, but that voice of yours haunts me.
Where is that girl?
Well, she's quite well,
I assure you.
I don't want assurances.
I want proof.
Now, let me see her.
It so happens, Mr. Griffin, that I'm in a mood to bargain.
Now, you let me have the drug and...
Listen, I'm not giving up anything.
- Unless...
- There's nothing you and your chemist can do anything about it.
Where's the girl?
Occidental decay is nowhere more apparent than in that childish sentimentality.
White men for their women.
I assume you demand the safety of this woman in return for your collaboration.
Well, I anticipated your wish.
The lady will be set free the very moment
I learn the secret of your transparency.
I believe you implicitly.
As a member of the German Secret Police,
I protest you holding me by force.
Maria.
You do understand, madam, that extraordinary circumstances justify unusual measures.
I have orders from the Gestapo to detain this man.
- Oh.
- You'll turn him over to me at once.
Very sorry, madam, that's impossible.
Duty compels me to take this rare specimen to my own country.
Oh.
You double-cross your own ally.
Our alliance is desirable only as long as it serves Japan.
Tell them to guard the doors.
Hurry up.
Oh, he's fainted.
Take him out of this room.
Take that woman out, too!
Get them both out of here.
Let me go. Help!
- Frank!
- Here, right here.
Now, keep out of sight.
May I remind you, sir, that this embassy is Japanese's territory.
Only so long as it suits our purpose, Baron.
They're getting away!
After them!
Move! Hurry!
Get up!
Don't waste any time.
Wait a minute, sir.
Griffin escaped.
You won't.
You failed, Stauffer.
We both failed.
No.
I'm going to make an honorable man even out of you.
Now, I am his successor.
I am the power.
The airport quickly.
- There he is.
- Heiser.
Back up. Back up.
We're going to England.
- England?
- Yes.
I've got some vital information that must get there before midnight.
What?
And thanks to your
Nazi friends for training you so well.
You're going to fly us.
Faster! Faster!
Look out!
Come on.
Get going.
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.
Call in the aircraft!
They should shoot that plane down!
Well, what are you waiting for?
Get after it!
There's a British spy in that plane!
Circle around a minute.
These planes are going to bomb New York.
I can't stop them, but I bet
I can slow them down.
That ought to hold them for a few hours.
Thank goodness for the clouds.
- You better put on a parachute.
- Good idea.
I'm going to set the automatic pilot and put these on.
Heiser!
Head straight for England.
Boy, I feel kind of high.
We're going higher so that their pursuit planes can't get us.
Wish I knew how to work this radio so I could let the British know we're coming.
I'll send them a message.
Oh, no, you won't.
What do you think I am? Stupid?
- But, Frank, if...
- We're still over the continent, and I don't trust you.
Probably, let the Nazis know our position.
Enemy plane bearing west, northwest.
Let me use the radio now.
- Enemy aircraft! On the go!
- Commence firing!
Do you want the British to shoot us down?
Take the control.
Frank.
Frank.
Wake up, Frank!
Frank, please wake up.
Look at the blightly.
He has no head.
So he has.
Good morning, Raymond.
How are you feeling?
Oh, hello, Sir Alfred.
Hmm, not bad.
I brought a young lady who is eager to meet you properly.
Ms. Maria Goodrich, one of our most trusted agents.
- Hello, Frank.
- One of your most what?
Hmm, she told me you'd never believe her, but it's true.
I'll see you later.
Poor darling.
You might have told me before.
I tried, but you wouldn't believe me.
Yes, I know.
Maybe I still don't.
People who live in transparent bodies shouldn't be so suspicious.
Darling, will you ever be able to get rid of your plate-glass effect?
I can't spend the rest of my life greased up like this.
Besides, it itches.
Hmm. Right here.
Will you please get some tissue out of that drawer and wipe it off? Huh?
Yes.
Right here.
Hmm.
Frank, you're all there.
How did it happen?
Can't tell you.
It's a military secret.
You mean, you still don't trust me?
- Won't I ever find out?
- No.
I'll find out.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
I am Baron Latos.
I have come to you for help.
It's 5:00 in the morning!
I must apologize for the intrusion, but travel for me is very difficult and I've come a long way.
I don't understand.
Perhaps you will after you've led me to the basement room of this castle.
Very strange request.
This is my home.
Have no fear, Doctor.
Had conditions permitted, I would have presented myself in the usual manner.
Well, it is most unusual.
I'll explain everything before sunrise.
Dr. Edelmann, do you believe in the immortality of the soul?
Naturally, being a religious man.
Of the body?
Medical science refutes such a thing.
Just as it denies the existence of vampirism.
It doesn't deny certain physical aspects of it.
Cases have been recorded in which the victims, driven by some abnormal urge, actually believed the blood of other people was necessary to keep them alive, became psychopathic killers in order to obtain it.
These beliefs probably upset their metabolisms, induced fixations, lustful appetites.
Of course, the whole thing is of a highly speculative nature, particularly the supernatural aspect.
Do you doubt the supernatural?
I find it difficult to believe that a human being can change himself into a bat, or that by feeding upon the blood of the living he can obtain eternal life.
But what has this discussion to do with us, Baron Latos?
Perhaps a great deal, Doctor.
Shall we proceed?
The Dracula crest.
Yes, Doctor.
I am Count Dracula.
But I'm known to the outside world as Baron Latos.
You see before you a man who lived for centuries, kept alive by the blood of innocent people.
You ask me to believe that?
That's why I've come to you.
To seek release from a curse of misery and horror against which I am powerless to fight alone.
According to the legend, a vampire must return to his grave before sunup.
If you remain here, how would that be possible?
Within this coffin is a layer of soil taken from my native country.
That earth makes this my grave, in which I must lie helpless during the daylight hour.
Because a single ray of sunlight falling on the vampire would destroy him.
Yes, Doctor.
The door was locked.
How did you get that in here?
Since you doubt the supernatural, let us say that you were mistaken.
The outer door was not locked.
You're taking a great deal for granted, Baron.
Proceeding on the assumption that I would take your case.
Your reputation for helping others made me certain that you would.
You could affect a cure?
There might be a way, despite the dangers involved.
It would be a challenge to medical science.
Accept that challenge, Doctor.
But decide quickly.
The dawn.
- Good morning, Nina.
- Good morning, Doctor.
Make a blood smear of this for me, will you, please?
A Baron Latos will be in this evening.
I'll see him immediately.
Well, how are things coming?
Splendid, Doctor.
Increasing the humidity was a good idea.
The spores are multiplying faster than ever.
Yes, we're making progress, all right.
Oh, the operation on
Johannes' leg proves that.
If we can produce the mold in quantity, think what it will mean to thousands of people all over the world.
We'll succeed, Nina.
And when we do, your devotion to this experiment will be rewarded.
You'll be the first to benefit by it.
Nina?
Make a culture of this and prepare an antitoxin as soon as possible.
All right, Doctor.
I am Baron Latos.
Dr. Edelmann is expecting me.
Baron Latos.
Miss Morelle?
What a pleasant surprise.
It's good to see you again, Baron.
You left Schvonheim just as we were becoming acquainted.
I could hardly refuse the opportunity to become Dr. Edelmann's assistant.
Now that chance has brought us together again, I hope to see you quite often.
I've taken a chateau close by.
You're not here as a patient.
Unfortunately, the Doctor thought it advisable that I come here for treatment.
Good evening, Baron. Come in.
Miss Morelle, it will be necessary for Baron Latos to have his appointments during the evenings.
Yes, Doctor.
Sit down, Baron.
Thank you.
It appears that I may have to alter my theories.
An examination of your blood reveals the presence of a peculiar parasite.
A form with which
I'm completely unfamiliar.
It's possible that it may have something to do with your problem.
Proceeding on the assumption that it has,
I'm having an antitoxin prepared so that we can see.
Your new theory being...
That a pure culture of a parasite, introduced into the parent bloodstream, will destroy not only its own kind, but themselves as well.
Sounds very promising.
Perhaps.
But we must proceed slowly.
These treatments will take some time?
Without doubt.
Meanwhile, your visits here should be only at intervals.
On the nights and at the hours which I shall designate.
Is that understood?
Quite clearly.
Then we shall start treatments tonight.
The transfusion.
How long will the Doctor be busy?
Some little time, I'm afraid.
I'm must see him at once.
I've come a long way.
If you'll just give him my name.
Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot.
Maybe he'll understand.
I can't interrupt the Doctor now.
He's giving a transfusion.
How long will that take?
Hour. Maybe longer.
I'm sorry, you'll just have to wait.
I can't wait!
There isn't time.
There isn't time!
Your next appointment will be Thursday evening, Baron.
At about the same time?
Yes.
Good night, Doctor.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh!
Baron.
Mr. Talbot was here to see you, Doctor.
- He was terribly upset.
- "Talbot"?
Lawrence Talbot.
He seemed to think you'd recognize the name.
"Lawrence Talbot." No.
There was something tragic about him.
He had the look of a man tormented by fear.
When I told him you were busy, he rushed out of the house saying he couldn't wait, there wasn't time.
Well, perhaps he'll come back.
Hello.
Just a moment, please.
It's Inspector Holtz.
Yes, Inspector?
Oh!
Very well, I'll be right down.
You'd better come along with me, Miliza.
Go to your homes, all of you.
This is no concern of yours.
We don't have to go home.
We know our rights.
That goes for you too, Steinmuhl.
Whenever there's trouble, you're always on the front line.
Oh, good evening, Doctor.
Come right in, will you?
Go home!
If I find the person who started the rumor we have a crazy man here,
I'll lock him up.
As a matter of fact, Doctor, we have.
He came in here a little while ago and demanded that I put him in a cell.
To keep him from committing murder, he said.
I did it to humor him.
But when he started raving,
I realized we had something serious on our hands and sent for you.
Decent sort of chap, otherwise.
- Name of Talbot.
- Talbot?
You remember, Doctor.
The young man I told you about.
Come in, Doctor. He's in here.
Who are these people?
Get them out of here!
I didn't come here to be put on exhibition.
Come, come now. Take it easy.
This is Dr. Edelmann.
He's come to help you.
Dr. Edelmann!
Yes. You wanted to see me?
That's why I came to Visaria.
In the hope that you could help me.
It's too late now.
What seems to be your trouble, my boy?
Do you believe that a man can be transformed into an animal?
I believe anything can happen in a person's mind.
This is not in my mind.
Doctor.
Have you ever heard of the pentagram?
The five-pointed star.
The mark of the beast.
When the full moon rises,
I turn into a werewolf, with only one desire in my mind.
To kill!
Listen to me, Talbot.
There's no such thing as a werewolf.
It's a belief that exists only in your mind.
Doctor, isn't there something you can do?
Not until morning, when this passes.
Bring him to me then.
Put him in my care, and I'll do all I can for him.
Oh, I didn't hear you.
The Doctor will see you now.
Do you think he can help me?
He's done some wonderful things.
Then why has he kept me waiting here all day?
Doesn't he realize that tonight...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I know he'll do whatever he can for me.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Sit down, Mr. Talbot.
What have you got to tell me?
In your case, my boy, diagnosis is extremely difficult.
But the examination you made this morning, the X-rays.
Examination discloses one condition, pressure upon certain parts of the brain.
This condition coupled with your belief that the moon can bring about a change accomplishes exactly that.
During the period in which your reasoning processes give way to self-hypnosis, the glands which govern your metabolism get out of control, like a steam engine without a balance wheel.
When this happens, the glands generate an abnormal supply of certain hormones.
In your case, those which bring about the physical transformation which you experience.
But explaining it doesn't help.
What can you do about it?
Operate?
A surgical operation to enlarge the cranial cavity is a long and dangerous one.
Then there's nothing you can do to help me.
There might be.
Come here, my boy.
Under tropical conditions, which we have tried to duplicate here, this hybrid plant, clavaria formosa, produces a mold from which we've been able to distill...
Well, a substance which possesses the property of softening any hard structure composed of calcium salts.
Bone, for instance.
With this medium, it might be possible without surgery to reshape the cranial cavity and thus eliminate the pressure.
You can do that now?
Can you?
Unfortunately, it will take some time to produce mold in sufficient quantity.
Tonight, the moon will be full again.
What can you do to help me now?
Only what you did for yourself last night.
Confine you.
No, Doctor.
No.
I can't go through that again.
Talbot, listen.
Talbot. Talbot!
Talbot, come back!
Siegfried!
Siegfried!
There are many caves along the coastline here made by the tides.
There's still a chance that he can be saved.
We must think of the danger to Dr. Edelmann.
If Mr. Talbot has been swept into the cave down there, he's still under the spell of the moon.
We must wait till it sets.
When it does, if he's still alive, he'll try to destroy himself again.
That's why the Doctor must time his actions to the very moment.
If he can find him just as the seizure passes, and his reason returns...
Perhaps he can persuade him to want to live.
Here we work half a night to get this thing rigged up, and then he says, "We'll wait a while."
What's going on around here anyway?
That's Dr. Edelmann's business.
Strange business, if you ask me.
All right, swing me out.
Lower away.
Easy!
All right!
I might've killed you.
Why did you follow me down here?
To bring you back, my boy.
Back to a life of misery and despair?
I only wanted to die.
You want to die, but instead you will live, because God, in his divine workings, has lead you to the very thing which makes help possible.
Look about you.
The temperature and humidity down here are ideal for growing the spore-producing plants.
Before the next full moon, we should have more than enough to help you.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
You can, my boy.
But you must do your part.
You must want to live.
The Frankenstein monster.
That must be the skeleton of Dr. Niemann, who revitalized him years ago.
As the story goes, the villagers drove them into the swamp, and they went down in quicksand.
After all these years, the mud has brought them here.
Still alive.
He's indestructible.
Frankenstein's creation is man's challenge to the laws of life and death.
Doctor!
Dr. Edelmann!
Doctor, look here.
There must be a way out of here into the castle.
History mentions an old torture chamber.
But its entrance was sealed up years ago.
He was made bit by bit, piece by piece.
The undying monster.
Triumphant climax of
Frankenstein's genius.
The heart that Frankenstein gave him never died.
The spark of life is still there, waiting to be revived.
Dr. Edelmann, this thing destroyed Frankenstein.
It's brought death to all who have tried to follow in his footsteps.
Is that poor creature responsible for what he is?
It's a thing of violence to whom death would be a merciful release.
Can man sit in judgment over life and death?
The evil he creates, he can also destroy.
That would be murder.
Think what you're doing, Doctor.
To bring him back again, Doctor, would unleash worse than murder upon humanity.
That helpless body is man's responsibility.
Man's responsibility is to his fellow man.
Perhaps you're right, Nina.
Frankenstein's monster must never wreak havoc again.
Baron.
I didn't hear you come in.
Please, go on.
You like it?
It breathes the spirit of the night.
They played it the evening we met at the concert.
I'd forgotten.
Until I saw you again.
Perhaps I wanted you to remember.
I've never heard this music before, yet I'm playing it.
You're creating it...
For me.
It frightens me.
It's beautiful.
It's the music of the world from which I come.
It makes me see strange things.
People who are dead, yet they're alive.
Mine is a world without material needs.
It calls to me, but I'm afraid.
The fear will pass as the music becomes fixed in your mind.
It will make you long to be there.
Why do you stop?
Play the music again.
There's something Dr. Edelmann told me to do.
Roll up your sleeve, please, Baron.
The music will come to you again.
My world is waiting for you.
Forsake the cross so that you can join me there.
Your world is coming closer to me.
But I'm afraid.
It is a world without fear.
It is like the music.
Beautiful. Beautiful.
Oh, good evening, Baron.
Thank you, Miliza. That'll be all.
I feel that we're making progress, Baron.
This photomiorograph of your blood reveals an odd condition.
One which I can't account for as yet.
What is it, Doctor?
A different species of antibodies has appeared.
Why worry so long as the treatments are proving successful?
If a doctor affects a cure, he wants to know how he did it.
Which is of little concern to the patient so long as he's being cured.
Day after tomorrow?
At the same time.
Then good night, Doctor.
Please go to bed, Miliza.
I'll finish down here.
I think I will.
Miliza!
Miliza! Are you all right?
The music is bringing my world closer.
Closer.
Doctor, Baron Latos...
He left here early this evening, didn't he?
About half past 8:00. Why?
I...
I...
Miliza and I were working.
What are you trying to tell me?
Come, speak up.
She seemed awfully tired.
Like a person in a trance.
In a trance?
She left me without saying a word.
I followed her.
She met Baron Latos in the hall.
They went into the garden.
And when he walked in front of the mirror,
I couldn't see his reflection.
I imagined that, didn't I?
Didn't I?
No, Nina.
Baron Latos shows no reflection.
Then he...
He's Count Dracula.
In trying to save him,
I've endangered the lives of all of you.
Then cast away the cross so that you may join me there.
I must try to stop him before it's too late.
But how?
Prepare for a transfusion at once.
You can't give another one so soon.
Do as I tell you.
If anything should happen to me tonight, go into the old armor room in the basement and burn what you find there.
What is it, Doctor?
You'll understand.
You must destroy it by fire.
Go to your room.
When you hear the music,
I will come to you.
I've been looking for you, Baron.
You remember that I was puzzled tonight by the new antibodies?
Yes.
I know now where they came from.
They're from my blood.
We may be on the verge of an important discovery.
So, to check my theory,
I'm going to give you another transfusion.
Now?
Immediately.
If this is the answer, we must see.
Doctor.
Dr. Edelmann!
Doctor!
Dr. Edelmann!
He's gone.
Mr. Talbot!
Mr. Talbot!
- Miliza.
- She's all right now.
But what about him?
The evil I brought here will never live again.
They tried to kill you, but they couldn't.
Frankenstein gave you eternal life.
Power which time cannot destroy.
The secret of immortality, it will soon be mine.
Dr. Edelmann?
Go away. Leave me alone.
Dr. Edelmann, I have some coffee for you.
Go away, I tell you.
Dr. Edelmann, let me in!
Doctor.
Doctor, you're ill.
No.
I'm all right.
That'll make you feel better.
How much of the spore concentrate have we ready?
Don't worry about that now.
We're making fine progress.
Answer me.
Is there enough for two operations?
No, there won't be for some time.
But we do have enough for one?
I think so.
Then I must operate as soon as possible, on you.
- But Doctor...
- You were right, Nina.
I am ill.
It's impossible to know what the future holds.
There, there, Doctor.
You mustn't talk like that.
I'll operate tomorrow, Nina.
Then you must operate on Mr. Talbot.
The moon will be full in a few days.
We can't let him suffer again.
But you... You've waited such a long time.
Then I can wait a little longer.
It won't make any difference.
You're worn out.
Why don't you get some rest?
I'm all right.
I know who you're thinking of.
I'm hoping we'll be ready in time.
I can't stand the thought of him having to go through that again.
Don't worry, we'll have enough.
Why, it's wonderful, Dr. Edelmann.
What you've done would ordinarily mean an operation of the most delicate nature.
This way, the dangers of surgery didn't even exist.
We can expect some nervous shock.
He must be kept quiet.
Any exertion might undo everything
I hope we've accomplished.
We'll know in a few days, Miliza.
All we can do now is hope.
And pray.
We must think now only of Nina.
Every minute must be devoted to producing more of the concentrate.
For her.
You're a fine nurse, Miliza.
You know perfectly well Mr. Talbot should be asleep by now.
Sleep?
I'll have a lifetime in which to sleep, when I know what lies ahead.
After what Dr. Edelmann has done for you, only happiness lies ahead.
I wonder.
Please don't think that I'm ungrateful.
Time after time, people have tried to help me.
Time after time, they've failed.
- If this fails, I...
- It won't fail, Larry.
You must believe that it won't.
I've tried to.
But when I face the night...
Try to see the night as something beautiful.
Until the full moon turns it into a thing of ugliness and horror.
Soon, you'll see it as everyone else does.
Restful, tranquil and serene.
Until that time comes,
I'll live 1,000 hopes, die 1,000 times.
It will never be ugly to you again, Larry.
Believe me, I know it.
How do you know that?
My heart tells me.
Hello, Siegfried.
Dr. Edelmann!
Did you hear me call to you, Siegfried?
Why, no, sir.
I would have stopped for you if I had.
I'm certain you would have.
Don't worry about it, Siegfried.
What's the matter, Siegfried?
You act as though you were afraid.
Oh, no, sir.
Why should I be afraid?
Of the night, perhaps?
I'm not afraid of the night.
Your hands are trembling, Siegfried.
Are they?
Siegfried.
Yes, sir?
I believe I know what you're afraid of.
Do you?
You're afraid of me.
Of you, sir?
'Cause if you weren't, you'd look at me, Siegfried.
Hyah!
Hyah!
See, you are afraid of me.
You're driving faster and faster, so that you can get into the village and tell the police.
Why? Why should I want to tell the police anything?
Because you're afraid
I'm going to kill you!
Kill me? Doctor!
Yes. You've seen what's happened to your old friend.
He doesn't want anybody but himself to know about that.
No, Doctor!
I will never tell!
That's right, Siegfried. You never will!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help! Help!
There he is! There he is!
This way!
This way!
It's your brother, Siegfried.
Is he dead?
There he goes!
Good evening, Inspector.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Doctor, but I'd like to see Mr. Talbot and everybody else in the house at once.
Certainly.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll know in good time, Doctor.
Now, please hurry.
Now, Inspector, what is it?
Your man Siegfried's been murdered.
Siegfried?
Murdered?
By the person who rode into the village with him tonight.
His throat was torn open as though by some enraged animal.
So naturally you suspect me.
I have good reason to.
But he hasn't been out of the house for days.
Not to your knowledge, perhaps.
Have you been with him all evening?
Until an hour ago.
Well, the murder was only committed 20 minutes ago.
And within the last five minutes, we pursued the murderer to these very grounds.
But it's impossible, Inspector.
Only the full moon affects Mr. Talbot.
The moon won't be full again until tomorrow night.
Not only that, Inspector, but Mr. Talbot has undergone an operation which makes physical exertion out of the question.
Running even a short distance, much less from the village, would cause serious complications.
A cerebral hemorrhage, perhaps even his death.
I respect your word, Doctor, but a murder has been committed.
It's imperative that I search your premises immediately.
He's the man you want.
Are you gonna let Dr. Edelmann talk you out of it?
That's enough, Steinmuhl. That's enough.
I apologize, Doctor, but the man who killed his brother is somewhere around here.
It's my duty to find him.
I shall hold you responsible for these people until further notice.
Yes?
What are you doing here, my boy?
You shouldn't be up.
Never mind me, Doctor.
It's you I'm worried about.
You were with Siegfried tonight when he went to the village.
I saw you.
I saw you when you came back.
Why didn't you tell Inspector Holtz?
After what you've done for me?
Why, you tried to help me.
And you want to help me now?
If I possibly can.
Because you suffered the tortures
I'm going through now, you of all people will understand what I'm going to say.
In trying to perform the miracle of medical science,
I failed.
My blood has been contaminated by the blood of Dracula.
My soul and mind have been seized by some nameless horror, a lust which changes me into the thing that killed Siegfried tonight.
You wish to help me?
There's one way in which you can.
Say nothing to Inspector
Holtz of what you know.
Not to protect me, but to give me time.
Time to do for Nina what I've done for you.
After that, this evil thing must be destroyed.
You have my word that it will be, my boy.
But if I am unable, you must do it for me.
Dr. Franz Edelmann.
Bonn University, cum laude.
What's going on here?
I was just on my way over to your office, Inspector.
I want you to take a look at this.
I found it clenched in
Siegfried's left hand.
Dr. Edelmann killed him.
Be quiet, Steinmuhl.
You don't know what this means.
Neither do I.
It's obviously a matter for the police to handle.
Is that clear?
It's clear Dr. Edelmann killed my brother.
Last night, you thought it was Talbot.
Tonight, you say it's a man who we all have known and respected for years.
Good heavens, you're worse than a gossiping old woman.
Go home. Go home.
Go home, all of you!
I'm sick and tired of this. Come on, break it up. Break it up, come on.
Something's going on at Dr. Edelmann's, I tell you.
What does Holtz have to say about it?
"This is a matter for the police to handle."
It's a matter for us to handle, unless we all want to be murdered.
He's right.
I'm for doing something about it.
Well, I don't know, now.
I'm with you.
The next few moments will give us our answer.
It's the time we've all been looking forward to.
You must put fear out of your mind.
Confront it with a belief that the past is over with, that a new life lies ahead.
A new life.
Stay here, please. All of you.
- But, Larry...
- No!
Not until we can be sure.
Doctor, it's wonderful.
Dr. Edelmann? Doctor!
That's it. That's it.
Now! Now!
That's it. That's it.
I'll make you strong, stronger than you've ever been.
I'll give you the strength of 100 men.
No, Dr. Edelmann.
No! You promised.
What are you doing here?
Why, I...
You were spying on me, weren't you?
No, I just wanted to find you.
I wanted to tell you that I...
You shouldn't have done that, Nina.
I want to see Dr. Edelmann at once.
You shouldn't have come here.
I don't like people who see what they're not supposed to see.
- Doctor!
- He's gone mad.
Hello, Mr. Talbot.
You broke your promise to me, didn't you?
You told the police.
I don't like people who break their promises, Mr. Talbot.
Get out! The Frankenstein monster!
[Inaudible]
(Narrator) The Wizard's men intercept a shipment of synthetic diamonds needed to operate their remote control machine.
Batman and Robin pursue the thieves.
Their car is disabled.
They commandeer another and...
Car 4 calling headquarters.
Headquarters. Come in, car 4.
There's another car trailing us.
Can you look it over through your televiewer?
Yes. Stand by.
[Electronic buzzing]
Batman and Robin are in that car.
Batman's too clever for his own good.
This time I'll do more than stop him.
This ought to be good.
[Machine whirring]
The Wizard has taken control.
Bail out.
[Crackling]
Keep down, the Wizard may be able to see us.
Headquarters to car 4, headquarters to car 4.
This is car 4.
Come in, headquarters.
Batman has been taken care of for good.
I've seen to it personally.
Good work.
Things ought to be different now, with Batman out of our hair.
They will be.
Yeah, it's a long walk back to where we left the car.
I hope it runs.
The wiring's probably burned out.
And we'll have to square things with that man whose car we took.
Any more worries?
I've persuaded commissioner
Gordon to let Jimmy Vale go, so we can watch him.
We haven't had much time to do that.
Maybe Vicki's keeping track of her brother.
I hope so.
I think we can take a chance now.
Hello. This is Jimmy Vale.
OK, Neil, rendezvous "D".
I'll be right over.
[Footsteps approaching]
Markham building.
[Engine starting]
Keep the change.
[Telephone ringing]
Mr. Wayne's residence.
Oh, this is Vicki Vale. I must speak to mr. Wayne at once.
I'm sorry, miss Vale, he's not at home.
Do you know where you can find him?
No, I don't. Do you wish to leave a message?
Yes, tell him that...
Oh, never mind.
[Machine humming]
Somebody's coming along the corridor towards the door.
See who it is.
It's Jimmy Vale.
He sure took his time.
What took you so long?
My sister Vicki dropped in.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
E. Certainly. Otherwise I wouldn't have come her sit down and relax.
We've got a big job coming up.
Any messages, Alfred?
(Alfred) Miss Vale called a little over an hour ago.
She seemed quite angry when she learned you were not at home.
Thanks.
I wonder What Vicki wanted. might be something about her brother.
I hope he doesn't get her in trouble.
[Machine humming]
Someone's snooping around this floor.
See who it is.
He doesn't stand still long enough.
Go out and look around.
Who are you looking for?
My brother.
We're just the boys who can take you to him.
[Knocking on door]
Vicki!
You sure fixed things.
Let her go. so she can bring the police?
Maybe she already has.
Lock her up in there.
Get outside and see if she did bring any cops.
[Telephone ringing]
Mr. Wayne's residence.
This is Vicki Vale.
Look, I'm a prisoner in a downtown office building.
Now, I want you to write down this address and give it to Bruce.
The number is...
[Footsteps approaching]
[Door opening]
How much longer am I to be held a prisoner here?
Nice try, sister, but don't try it again.
Somebody for me, Alfred?
Yes, it was miss Vale, sir, but she's no long er on the wire.
Why not?
Somebody forced her to hang up.
Where is she?
Well, she started to explain she was being held prisoner in some office building.
Then the connection was broken.
That building must be one of the Wizard's hideouts.
But how can we find it?
That last prisoner we caught should know where it is.
Getting him to reveal anything would be a man-sized job.
Yes, a Batman-sized job.
But it's our only hope.
Don't ask questions. Get in that delivery truck and take off.
[Engine starting]
Jason sure fell for that phony escape routine.
We can thank commissioner Gordon for helping us put it over.
I hope it helps us find Vicki.
This is Jason calling rendezvous C.
Jason calling rendezvous C.
Come in, rendezvous C.
He found the radio all right.
(Gabe) This is Gabe at rendezvous C.
I thought you were in the hoosegow, Jason.
I was, but I got out.
Where do I report?
Report to rendezvous "D".
Check.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
It's Jason.
Couldn't be, he's in jail.
Not now, he isn't.
He's right outside that door.
Let him in.
How'd you get here?
Well, don't you know? if I did, I wouldn't ask.
You mean you didn't have anything to do with my escape, or that getaway car?
Certainly not.
Someone's been playing games.
Well, it's not me.
[Machine humming]
Another visitor.
There's the answer.
Someone's tailed you here.
This'll take care of anybody who touches any metal in the hallway.
(Neil) He'll be knocked cold.
Come on, let's go.
[Door closes]
Vicki, this is Jimmy.
I'll get you out as soon as I can.
[Banging on door]
[Buzzing]
Bruce Wayne.
No one came this way.
Let's split up and head 'em off.
Let me out of here!
Open the door!
[Banging on door]
Batman, they're searching for you.
[Scuffling]
[Grunts]
[Thudding]
(Narrator) Must Robin now carry on alone?
Who is making a getaway in this speeding car?
See the startling answers in "Robin's ruse", chapter 11 of Batman and Robin, at this theatre next week.
I can't believe it's going to happen.
Just two more hours, and they're going to kill him.
You know, the way you take on, one would think it was you they're going to hang.
I'd rather, do you hear?
I'd much rather.
He could still get the reprieve, couldn't he, Mr. Cotton?
He will get it.
I'm praying he will.
Oh, he's so young.
They don't ask a murderer his age,
Cookie.
Mr. Geoffrey didn't murder his brother, and you know it as well as I do.
It ain't my business to know.
That's what we've got judges for. They're experts.
What would he do a thing like that for?
Why, he and his brother was pals like you never saw.
The Radcliffes are no murderers.
Blimey, you may be a good butler, but it's a dead cert you ain't no psychologist.
What do you know what goes on inside a man's mind?
Outside he may look like a gentleman, but inside, he may have the hankering for murder.
No. It's no good talking to a man with an apology for a brain.
I wish it was over.
I've been worrying so long whether that reprieve would go through or not, that...
You're all worried out, eh, Cotton?
Oh, shut your lip.
It's hard on all of us, Mr. Cotton, but what about poor Miss Manson?
Instead of him leading her to the altar, they're leading him to the gallows.
And Mr. Cobb, he ain't too happy neither.
Morning tea,
Miss Manson.
Morning? So soon?
Helen, you can't go on like this, you know, without sleep or anything.
You're not being fair to yourself or to Geoffrey.
Now, please have something.
At least a cup of tea.
Oh, Richard, they must have news by now.
Surely the reprieve has come through.
Well, they'd be sure to phone as soon as there's word.
Dr. Griffin is asking for you,
Miss Manson.
- Have you any news?
- None.
Mr. Cobb, isn't there some ray of hope left for him?
There must be hope.
There has to be.
I don't see what more we can do.
I've talked to dozens of influential people in London, old friends of whom I've never asked a favor before.
The Home Secretary, it seems impossible that he shouldn't at least grant a postponement.
Richard, please try.
Helen, if it's "no," be brave.
You know what has to be done.
Yes, very well.
I'll hold on.
You know, Helen,
I'd give my right arm if it would help you.
I feel my position very keenly, not only as Geoffrey's cousin, but as your friend...
Hello? Oh, yes, may I speak to
Philip, please?
Mr. Richard Cobb.
Yes, it's most urgent.
A matter of life and death.
Oh, I see.
Thank you.
It's no use.
He's away in Scotland.
It's impossible to reach him.
Thank you for permitting this last visit, Governor.
I wish I could do more.
It was his last request.
Take Dr. Griffin to the cell.
Sorry, but I can allow you just 10 minutes, Doctor.
Gin.
Governor's permit.
Huh?
Come in, sir.
He's gone!
Who's gone?
What do you mean?
The prisoner!
Radcliffe!
What are you talking about?
I never took me eyes off him, sir, not for half a second.
Then will you kindly explain how he can have gone?
- I wish I knew, sir.
- He just took wing and flew, did he?
You're under arrest, both of you.
Sound the alarm.
Come along.
Sampson speaking.
An escape, eh?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
I see.
Dr. Frank Griffin?
See if we have any file on a Dr. Frank Griffin.
Uh-huh.
All right, I'll be along as soon as possible.
Griffin?
Well, here's how it was, sir.
There wasn't no way he could have gone.
When Griffin was talking to him on the bed here,
I was over here playing cards with Bob.
Wasn't I, Bob?
And when this
Dr. Griffin went, the prisoner started talking to me after a bit about what a rotten day it was.
You know, the way they do to keep their spirits up a bit.
That's right.
And then he went back over here, stepped in here, turned on the water like that.
He washed his hands.
He took a towel like that, and he walked over here, still chatting about the weather, just as offhand as you please.
Then he stopped talking, and after a jiffy we go in.
And here's the water still running.
And there's nothing left but his clothes laying there on the floor, sir.
That's just the way it was.
So help me, Bob.
- Wasn't it, Bob?
- Just as sure as I stand here, sir.
It's witchcraft.
That's what it is, sir.
Don't talk rot, man.
The funny thing is
I believe it, word for word.
But he couldn't have vanished into thin air.
Couldn't he though?
Where have you been?
I've been trying to get you on the phone all morning.
I'm sorry, Mr. Cobb. I gave orders not to be disturbed.
You might have made an exception in my case.
I didn't expect you.
I'm doing some extremely delicate work.
What work can be as important as all that?
Haven't you heard the news?
Geoffrey's escaped, noose practically around his neck.
Yes, it's incredible, isn't it?
Well, that's an extraordinary attitude to take, I must say.
But what can I do?
Do? You must find him and help him.
And Helen.
Helen, with Geoffrey?
Isn't that natural for a fiancee?
She went out this morning and hasn't come back yet.
He's escaped, she's disappeared.
Man alive, doesn't it mean anything to you?
They're in danger.
They're hunting him, and she's with him.
They'll shoot him on sight.
On sight?
Knowing your friendship for Helen and Geoffrey, it's safe to assume that you wouldn't be working here as calmly as you are unless you knew where they were.
I don't think that you have any reason for that assumption.
You're evading my question.
It's obvious you know where they are.
Put that stuff down!
Mr. Cobb, please don't think me rude, but I have an enormous amount of work to do.
Now look here,
Dr. Griffin.
I've supported this laboratory in the tradition of my cousins and their humanitarian ideas.
I must ask you to give me the same consideration as you would give to them.
Gladly.
Very well then.
If they're together, if Helen is with him, they have no money, you must tell me how I can help them.
It's criminal not to.
I'm sorry.
Very well.
Sir Geoffrey's a right smart lad.
He'll get through.
And if he needs any help, he knows where to come for it.
- Aye.
- Come on, you men.
Look alive, dear.
Look alive.
Can't have work interrupted.
Haven't you heard?
Sir Geoffrey has escaped.
They do say it's a mystery.
Seemingly when a chap puts one over on the law, it's always a mystery.
The mystery would be if they catched him.
That's no business of yours!
Perhaps it hasn't occurred to you, the company doesn't pay you to stand here swapping mystery stories.
Keep thee wig on, Willie.
Mr. Spears to you.
I'll thank you to show proper respect.
Go on now. Get down that shaft if you want to keep off the dole.
All right, Mr. Willie Spears.
Get back to work,
I tell thee! Get out of my way!
What can I do for you?
Where can I find Dr. Griffin?
- Who might you be?
- Scotland Yard.
Oh, yes, sir.
I reckon you'll find him in the hospital building, sir, in his laboratory right over there.
Thank you.
A couple of cops.
A lot they'll find out.
Aye, they're up to something.
The gentleman wishes to see you, sir.
- Dr. Griffin?
- Yes.
I'm Sampson, Scotland Yard.
May I come in?
What can I do for you, Inspector?
What can you do for me, Doctor?
Very little,
I'm afraid.
You and Radcliffe were great friends, weren't you, Doctor?
We still are,
I'm happy to say.
Yes, Doctor. Quite so.
The research on which you and he were collaborating was interrupted by the unfortunate accident to Sir Michael, shall we say?
And to carry on such important work, a man like you wouldn't hesitate to break the law, would you?
Suppose you come to the point, Inspector.
I've been looking up the file on your late brother.
That was nine years ago, wasn't it?
Charming fellow and very ingenious.
He concocted a formula which included a poisonous drug called duocaine, an extraction of an East Indian herb that took the color out of things.
Combined with other ingredients known only to himself, it made the body transparent when injected into the bloodstream.
Very ingenious.
He succeeded, didn't he, in making himself invisible?
Really, Inspector, you don't have to go through all that.
I can remember it very well.
Yes, it isn't a thing a mere nine years can make you forget, is it?
You recall, of course, how he went insane and never regained visibility till after he was dead, and how he was finally killed by the police.
Shot down like a mad dog after hundreds had lost their lives.
A most hideous crime.
But, of course, Doctor, you would never make a man invisible with the danger of him going mad, unless you had a means of bringing him back in time.
Surely, in all those nine years, you've found a method of avoiding insanity, or perhaps even restoring visibility.
I was never interested in my brother's activities.
Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor.
I had hoped that you might cooperate.
You must realize that if the monster murders, the scientist hangs.
Have a cigar?
No, thanks.
I don't smoke.
Try it.
In smoke or rain, he becomes visible.
Cover this place.
I'll send some men out.
I tell you, miss, you're the first visitor to this cottage in nigh on a year.
Excepting Dr. Griffin, coming to look at my gouty old foot.
When do you expect the patient?
He'll be here very soon, Ben.
There's naught I won't be glad to do for a patient of Dr. Griffin.
Aye, and I'll be glad to have a body to talk to.
He's had a very serious accident,
Ben.
He needs rest and no unnecessary conversation.
Depend on me, miss.
Old Ben never talks except when it's wanted.
And I think he'd rather that no one knew he was here.
That's old Towser.
I wonder what's come over him.
Getting old and talkative, seems like.
What's the matter, you old fool?
Be quiet now.
Helen. Darling.
Come inside quickly, darling.
Will you stop?
It's not Buckingham
Palace, darling.
You're wrong. It is.
But at least it's comfortable and safe.
How does it feel to have a phantom fiance?
You're the best phantom I happen to know.
I can touch you.
Oh, you poor boy.
I don't know what to say.
I'm lucky.
I can see you.
After all, I'm not much to look at anyway.
Even when I...
Even when this...
It doesn't make any difference, dear.
We're together.
Soon it'll be as it always was.
All this is just a dream.
Now come.
Sit down and rest.
I'll get some tea.
You must be famished.
Oh, no. Thanks just the same, darling, but I don't want anything to eat.
Just sit down and talk to me.
It's all right.
You must have thought
I'd never get here.
It was kind of awful waiting, wondering if something had happened to you.
I couldn't find the spot where Frank had hidden the bag with the clothes.
You can't imagine how cold
I was until I found them.
You know, I'm beginning to understand why ghosts moan so in this sort of weather.
You haven't changed a bit.
That's a slight exaggeration.
But if the worst comes to the worst,
I can always get a job haunting a house.
There's not going to be any "worst."
Frank won't let us down.
He's working day and night on the antidote.
Stop that infernal row!
No, no.
I'm sorry, darling.
It's just that...
All these months,
I've thought about this day, mentally adjusting myself, certain that I'd be able to accept the change quite casually.
Now that it's happened, now that it's become a reality,
I don't know.
I can't stand it any longer, Helen!
He'll rouse the whole neighborhood. Stop him!
Darling, you know there's no one around here for miles.
Ben. I say, Ben, can't you take that dog away?
Tie him somewhere where we can't hear him.
Oh, don't pay no heed on him, miss.
Hey, you gert blunderhead.
I can't say
I blame you.
- I'd better be on my way again.
- Where?
Darling, I can't just sit around here with Michael's murderer at large.
Geoff, I understand, but you've got to take it easy for a few days.
You've been under such an awful strain.
I've almost forgotten how to relax.
I suppose I'll get used to this.
You won't have to, Geoff.
Frank's sure he'll have the antidote within a few days.
Yes. Yes, of course.
Helen...
- Promise me something.
- Yes?
Frank gave me his word that if my mind should begin to go before he found a way back for me, he'd prevent me doing any harm.
Chain me if necessary.
Help him keep his promise.
I don't know, darling. I feel...
You know, I feel...
I feel...
Hello there!
Jumpin' Jehoshaphat!
What do you want?
I was wondering whether a bite to eat wouldn't be welcome, sir?
Thank you.
Helen, don't look at me like that!
It was just waking up...
- And hearing Ben's voice.
- And then seeing me.
- Oh, Geoff, nothing's changed.
- Oh, I should have let them hang me!
Darling, darling, you mustn't say that!
Who was ever faced with a choice like that?
To be hanged by the neck until I was dead, or to take life on the terms of this fantastic drug.
Invisibility at the price of almost certain madness!
- Today, tomorrow...
- Darling, you must be patient.
It was fear!
Nothing but fear that decided me.
Oh, Helen, my life isn't so valuable that I should endanger yours and Frank's.
Oh, I am sorry, darling.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm a worm to treat you like this after all you've been through.
Here.
Now, we'll...
We'll wipe away those tears.
I'll try and act like a normal person.
Ben?
Hello there!
Ben!
Hey, Ben, isn't this your dog?
Aye! Daft old fool,
I had to put him out!
Put him out?
What for?
Listen. Shut up!
Keeping the whole place awake.
You have visitors, eh?
Visitors?
What would I be doing with visitors?
Nobody visits poor old Ben.
Then who were the dog keeping awake?
The neighbors.
Are you soft, man?
Why, there isn't a neighbor closer than Higginbottoms.
More than a couple of miles from here.
Look at him barking and barking like a mucky old fool!
Who's inside?
Isn't nobody here and nobody hasn't been here.
Who's in the upstairs room then?
Neither nobody nor nothing!
Here, be off, you.
I don't want any nosy coppers around my house.
All right, Ben.
Hey, I pay my rates regular.
Here, here, you can't go in there!
- What are we gonna do?
- Don't be afraid, darling.
I can leave any moment I like.
- It's my house!
- What's the matter with you?
Come along now.
I doesn't need you to search the whole house.
I wants to search that room upstairs.
I want a warrant before you can search my house.
And I don't need no warrant for that.
Get out of my way!
I want a warrant from you!
I couldn't stop him.
It isn't my fault.
"Neither nothing nor nobody," eh?
What's going on in here?
You know that you're intruding in a private house?
- Yes, sir, but...
- Then leave quickly, or you'll find yourself in trouble!
Come on, you silly old fool!
I'd better go now, darling.
You'll have to be brave.
- I'm trying to.
- Better turn around.
This may not be very pleasant.
Sorry.
You mucky old fool!
You doesn't know what you're doing!
Oh, I doesn't, eh?
Geoff, where shall I see you?
Where will you go?
I'll meet you at the manor after I've seen Frank.
- Take care of yourself, darling.
- I will.
It's bright and warm outside, thank goodness.
I'll be all right.
Helen!
Helen, darling!
His face is all wrapped up like, and he won't give me his name.
Will I arrest him?
We found him. He's at the gamekeeper's house.
A chap named Jenkins.
Don't do anything foolish.
And understand he must not get away.
And listen carefully now, under no circumstances allow him to take off his clothes.
Take off his clothes?
He won't do that, sir.
There's a lady with him.
Do as I tell you!
I'll be over right away.
"Don't let him take off his clothes." Is he daft?
- Take off his clothes.
- Hey, you can't go upstairs!
- It's no good, Ben. I have me duty to do.
- Get out of my house!
- Assaulting the law, are you?
- What do you know about assaulting...
- You have no business...
- Here, come here.
What are you doing?
- It's none of your problems. Come here.
- You have no business...
Let me alone!
It's the law!
And I have to uphold it!
That's what
I call bodily assault!
He took off his clothes!
No wonder she fainted.
So you just let the lady walk out and ride away, eh?
I had nothing to hold
Miss Manson on, sir.
I had no instructions about her.
And her looking so ill, sir.
Tewksbury, you're a credit to the force.
You used brains.
Watch her, but don't scare her too much.
That's our game.
We can't expect to catch the quarry if we shut up the bait.
Aye, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Here we are, sir.
Here. You can check with the prison records.
- They match.
- Yes?
Well, that clears up any doubt as to his identity, anyway.
Helen.
Helen!
Thank goodness that you're safe and sound.
I've lain awake all night worrying about you.
I'm sorry, Richard.
I should have thought.
You're so pale and exhausted.
You must consider yourself, Helen.
Where have you been?
- I'm quite all right.
- Helen...
You don't know what it means to me just to see you.
When you're away, I...
You look tired.
Go upstairs and rest.
I'll see you later in the study.
Who is it?
Who is it?
- Well?
- I don't know.
I was sure
I heard a knock too.
Hello, Radcliffe
Accident Home.
No, I'm sorry.
Mr. Champion was removed to the county hospital this morning.
I must have been mistaken.
Geoff.
- Headline news, eh?
- Of course.
- They don't know that I...
- Ah, but they do.
The police got out the file on my brother and twigged the whole thing in two minutes.
An inspector was here to tell me all about it.
Charming fellow.
- Why didn't they arrest you?
- How could they?
First they have to prove there is an invisible man, then that you're it, and finally, that
I'm one of the, uh, gang.
Well, that sounds enough to keep them busy for a while.
- How are you getting on?
- Splendidly.
But I need a little bit of your blood, old boy.
Gladly, if you can find it.
- Here, sit down here.
- Thanks.
Now, we get some alcohol.
See if we can find your vein without putting a tourniquet on your arm.
This feels like it.
It's gonna hurt.
- Frank.
- What is it?
How long do you think I have before I go mad?
Mmm.
Two days, two weeks...
Who knows?
Do you think you'll find the antidote before I...
Oh, I'll find it, all right. Don't you worry.
Good.
Here it is, I hope.
Now we'll put some color in this.
By Jove! That's what I call neat.
Comes of practicing on guinea pigs.
- Dr. Griffin!
- Come back later.
But it's important.
About the men working where Champion was injured.
Let him in.
One moment.
Oh, so he wouldn't see me.
I was thinking it would be nice if we could have a little talk.
That's a matter of opinion.
You've been interfering again in the pit, I hears, telling the men not to work in Number Three tunnel.
Glorified as usual, eh?
I'm doing my duty,
Dr. Griffin.
And if you'd do yours and not meddle where you're not wanted, happen Radcliffe pit would get along better.
Listen, Mr. Spears.
My duty is the men's health.
Any child would know that tunnel was unsafe.
Why, it's a sheer miracle that Champion got off with a pair of crushed legs in the fall yesterday.
Happen so, Dr. Griffin.
But Mr. Cobb gives the orders in Radcliffe pit and I get them carried out.
Happen also, Mr. Cobb says we don't need no laboratory.
Nor no doctor neither.
We're going to give you a nice little holiday.
"We"? You can tell
Mr. Cobb I'm not leaving.
I take orders from Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe.
"Sir Geoffrey."
Eh!
They'll shoot him down like a mad tyke.
I'll thank you to get out.
Mr. Cobb's the heir and the owner.
He'll have you out of here pretty quick.
As long as
Sir Geoffrey's alive,
Mr. Cobb knows he has nothing whatever to say.
Now get out of here before I bash your ugly head in!
You'll pay for this,
Dr. High-and-mighty.
Mr. Cobb will chuck you out.
See if he don't.
What's come over this place?
An imbecile like Spears talking to you in that manner.
A night watchman.
He never even did that job well.
Cobb made him superintendent.
His idea of superintending is to ignore every one of the safety rules that you laid down.
I don't understand it.
A man of that type.
Why on earth should Cobb...
You know, Frank, it's surprising how invisibility heightens one's sense of smell.
Goodbye.
Where are you going?
I think I smell something dead up a creek.
Whole place going to the dogs, that's what.
Hey!
Old crock. Eh.
You can't repair it,
Mr. Spears.
I had but one glass of whiskey.
Only one?
Well, two.
Satan!
You can't escape either, Mr. Spears.
- Where are you?
- Here I am, Mr. Spears.
Not over there. Here.
Show yourself, you coward, and I'll fight you!
Help! Help!
Faster,
Mr. Spears, faster!
Help!
Why don't you fly, Mr. Spears?
I told you there was no escape, didn't I, Mr. Spears?
Where are you?
- Where are you?
- Here beside you.
- But... But I can't see you!
- Of course you can't.
I'm a ghost.
Ghost!
Can a ghost sneeze?
It's cold in the other world, so cold!
Lend me that handkerchief of yours, Mr. Spears.
Who are you, ghost?
What do you want of me?
They were going to hang me, Mr. Spears.
Remember me? Geoffrey Radcliffe.
But I escaped the noose.
I ran blindly out into the mist.
I didn't know the marshes were there.
I stumbled and fell.
It pulled me down.
Inch by inch, down.
It was a horrible death, Mr. Spears.
I can't find peace in the other world.
No!
Here, I must have had a nightmare.
I've been imagining things.
It isn't a very comfortable feeling, is it, Mr. Spears?
Have pity,
Sir Geoffrey! Have pity!
Did you have any pity on me?
Had you one thought for me, lying day after day in that prison of despair?
- No...
- Feeling the rope around my throat, choking the very breath of life out of me?
What was it to you? Nothing!
You were promoted.
You were made superintendent.
There's an account to be settled, Mr. Spears.
I'll tell everything!
I'll tell everything!
Mr. Cobb made me lie!
He were in the shaft when Sir Michael were killed.
I saw you come out, sir, and I heard
Sir Michael call after you.
Then, after you'd come out,
Mr. Cobb come out.
I couldn't help meself, sir.
Mr. Cobb told me he'd kill me if I told on him.
Sir Geoffrey, you've always been such a kind man and all.
Have mercy on a poor, ignorant man.
Sir Geoffrey!
Sir Geoffrey!
Where are you?
Where are you?
There!
That's exactly what I've been looking for.
No, no, no, no!
Sorry your little trip will have to be postponed, Mr. Spears.
But don't worry,
I'm going to make you quite comfortable.
And after I've got you all tucked up for the night,
I've got an appointment to keep with a certain gentleman named Richard Cobb.
I must say, I wouldn't have given
Richard credit for so much ingenuity.
Helen.
I'm so glad you've come.
You know, you really are amazing.
It's hard to believe you've had so little rest.
Thank you, Richard.
Now come and sit down and tell me all about it.
- How's Geoffrey?
- Geoffrey?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, I...
I assumed you'd be with him.
Lucky I got back before the rain started.
Helen, I want you to trust me.
Without our help, he hasn't the chance.
The police are sure to find him.
We'll get him to the continent or to America.
You must tell me where he is for his sake.
All right, Richard.
I'll start from the beginning.
I'll start from the beginning if you don't mind, Helen.
- Geoffrey!
- Yes, Richard,
I've come for a little chat.
Geoffrey, where are you?
You're amongst friends, there's no danger.
Friends like you are a great comfort.
Where are you,
Geoffrey? Show yourself.
I'd have a little difficulty doing that just now.
Where are you hiding?
Perhaps that will show you where your friend is hiding.
Sit down.
Now, Richard, start to write.
- Write what?
- A confession, of course.
I... I don't know what you're talking about.
No? Well, then,
I'll help revive your memory.
You recall my brother,
Michael, no doubt?
Yes.
And surely you remember killing him?
- It isn't true!
- Geoffrey, he didn't kill Michael.
Didn't he?
That shows how little you know dear old Richard.
It was his charming way of getting rid of both of us.
Killing Michael, implicating me.
No, don't shoot! No!
No! Don't!
No, don't!
Oh, Mr. Cobb!
I'm Inspector Sampson.
Can I be of any help?
- I don't understand.
- Well, he's here, is he?
Geoffrey, he's invisible.
Why can't I see him?
Smoke a cigar, Mr. Cobb, and perhaps you will.
Is everyone mad?
You must catch him, Inspector.
He wants to kill me.
Mmm? What makes you think he'd want to do that,
Mr. Cobb?
Because he's mad, completely out of his mind!
I must get away.
Your safety means as much to us as it does to you, Mr. Cobb.
I think you'd be wise to stay.
In fact, I'm sure you'd better stay!
Out! Out!
You take five men with nets and smoke cylinders to the upper floor.
You take five men to the servants' quarters.
Very good, sir.
You watch the front door.
You see that all doors and windows are covered from the outside.
The rest, follow me.
Now, Mr. Cobb,
I'd be very happy to provide you with a cordon of police to ensure your safety.
Just a moment.
Now, Mr. Cobb, if you'll just sit down.
Thank you.
You, the door.
Close it, stay there.
You, the window.
You, the back door.
The rest of you, around him, close.
Guard this man carefully.
He's extremely valuable.
I appreciate your good intentions,
Inspector.
But I'd rather have an escort to take me to London.
You're perfectly safe here, Mr. Cobb,
I can assure you.
What assurance can you give me while
I'm in the same house with him?
Mr. Cobb, please.
Calm down, calm down.
Inspector, you must help me.
I can't stay here.
Take me into protective custody.
- Take me to prison.
- Plenty of time, Mr. Cobb.
Plenty of time.
Orders to shoot on sight.
I thought he said the bloke was invisible.
You missed him!
How did you know I did?
You watch the door.
I know.
We nearly got him, sir.
As soon as he steps out in the rain, you can spot him.
- Where is he now?
- We've chased him back in the house, sir.
Good, keep at it.
We've got him bottled up now.
Beg your pardon, miss.
Get to work, men.
You have no right here.
Sorry, we have our orders.
You've got to get out of here, miss.
Will you please leave me alone?
- I'll never leave you alone, darling.
- Geoffrey.
I can get out of here, if you'll lend me a hand.
Just faint, will you please, darling?
Faint?
Nothing in the servants' rooms, sir.
You fellows stay here till they finish upstairs.
When they come down, we'll do the ground floor and the cellar.
I know he's down here somewhere.
- What's the matter with the blasted thing?
- It's the safety valve!
The safety valve!
Make way, you men, we need air.
Come! Get her out. Quick!
She needs air.
Stop that!
Get out of the way.
Bill! Harry!
Come quick!
We've got him.
Upstairs, quick!
That's it.
Stay on. Come on, put your shoulders in it.
It isn't him, sir.
A profound observation.
- Evening, Briggs.
- Evening, sir.
- Everything quiet?
- Quiet as the grave.
- Rain stopped.
- About time, too.
Not so lovely for you if our friend drops in.
I'm ready for him.
Fat lot of good that'll be against something that isn't there.
I don't hold with no spiritualism.
This isn't spiritualism.
This spook's alive.
How can he be alive if he isn't there?
You'll know soon enough when he suddenly leaps on your back and starts sucking your blood.
Get off.
See you later, I hope.
Briggs! Briggs!
- What's the matter?
- Something moved!
Did it?
Who's up there?
Come down now or you'll cop it.
See you later, I hope.
Answer it, Helen.
Hello? Geoff.
Sorry, Helen, I couldn't come to the lab.
I'm at Frank's house.
Of course the place is guarded, but little things like that don't stop me any longer.
Tell Frank this house of his is chilly.
I'm going to get into his best suit of clothes.
Just a minute.
He's at your house.
He wants some of your clothes.
- Tell him to go ahead.
- Help yourself, dear.
I will.
You and Frank come over here.
We're going to celebrate!
Celebrate? Well, yes, we'll be over soon.
"Celebrate"!
What on earth does he want to celebrate?
That he must go mad?
That his friend, the great scientist
Frank Griffin, has utterly failed him?
- Frank!
- Oh, Helen, I never should have done it.
Imagine me thinking
I could solve this riddle in a few days.
- I'd need a lifetime.
- Frank...
What an utter fool I've been!
Frank, you're exhausted.
You mustn't lose hope.
The harder I work, the more endless the job looks.
How can I possibly succeed?
My brother was the foremost chemical engineer in the country, and all he ever succeeded in finding was madness.
- But, Frank...
- How can I face Geoff with nothing?
Whatever happens, you mustn't let him know that.
I've let you both down.
You should have seen them searching for me, Frank.
Smoke bombs and gas masks and the fishnets.
They must have thought
I was a herring.
And I marched straight through them with Helen, took her politely out to the car.
Softly, old boy.
Don't forget the wolves are prowling outside.
Yes. You know, Frank, I'm beginning to get a new perspective on this crawling little animal known as man.
Why, a dog or a cat or a bird is cleverer than any human.
They sense me immediately.
But these shrewd detectives of yours...
Take away one of man's senses and you render him helpless.
Geoff, you don't really think Richard could have killed...
"Could have"?
He did.
I have proof of it.
Dear old
Inspector Sampson.
He's turned out to be my best assistant.
He's keeping Richard prisoner for me...
Until I'm ready for him.
And Richard's boyfriend, Spears, is anxiously awaiting me at his home.
Does Sampson know that Cobb and Spears are mixed up together in this?
- No, not yet.
- Then why not produce the evidence?
Give Sampson the information, and you'll be free.
Free?
I am free!
I've never been more free in my life.
You know, being invisible has distinct advantages.
It gives one a sense of power that's exciting.
Power for good, if you are so inclined.
Or, should you feel perverse, for evil.
You hold the balance and decide which way life shall go.
No one can stop you.
No one can touch you.
You don't need any infantile little
Sampsons to carry out your will.
You're much greater than any of them.
Rather a magnificent idea to play with, isn't it?
More wine, Frank.
I'll get it.
- Sorry.
- Just what we needed.
Seven days' good luck.
Geoff, you can't mean that about having power for good or evil.
Of course I can.
Just think what I could do for my country.
Or, let's say, with my country.
Control it!
Other nations would tremble before us as this nation will tremble before me.
Don't you see what my power does for me?
I could sit in on the councils of kings and dictators.
It makes me king!
It makes me nemesis.
Geoffrey, do you remember a promise I made you?
What promise?
To restrain you if the effects of the duocaine disturbed your mind?
Are you, by any chance, trying to be amusing?
No.
It just occurred to me that...
You're not mistaking my good spirits for madness, I hope.
I just wondered if you remembered.
You needn't worry about my memory.
Geoff's right.
No worrying this evening.
A toast! To the quick conviction of the ambitious Mr. Cobb.
What's the matter with you?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Please,
Geoff, take it easy.
You know they're watching the house.
If they hear you, they'll break up our little party.
You aren't afraid for me, are you?
Well, I...
No, you aren't.
You know they can't get me.
You're afraid for yourself.
Afraid of what they might do to you!
Geoff, don't talk like that.
Oh, my dear friend, Dr. Griffin.
Has it ever occurred to you that friendship, at best, is a rather doubtful asset?
I don't want friends.
I shall have worshippers and followers, people who will obey me because they recognize my greatness.
Those who are loyal will be rewarded, and the others destroyed.
Hail, invincible leader.
We follow you.
Let's drink to the coming golden age which you will provide.
I don't think I care to drink with you.
Somehow I don't feel very comfortable with you any longer.
Geoffrey.
Don't worry.
I'll be back.
Frank, is...
Helen, you mustn't lose your head now.
You mean he...
I never thought the duocaine would work so fast.
- He's mad.
- No, Frank, no!
I was hoping he'd take that drink.
It's drugged.
- Why?
- I can't control him by force.
What are we going to do?
When he comes back, we'll have to play up to him.
Get him to take the drink.
Don't stand there cowering.
Sit down and finish your supper.
I feel better this way.
In a second,
I'm safe.
And not only from the police.
I can roar my head off if I want to!
Let's drink to the golden age.
Well, drink.
Drink to me!
Drink to my invincible power, to a new era, to a changed world with me as its guiding genius.
Well, why don't you smile?
That's better.
Now, I'm sorry to leave your two smiling, happy faces, but I have business to attend to.
Richard expects me.
I hate disappointing friends.
Oh, Frank!
Don't worry. The effect of the drink won't take long to wear off.
No, he'll be violent when he comes to.
I was prepared for it.
I'll take him into the study.
Open the door.
Please don't come in, Helen.
Stay where you are.
Four cylinders, and only missing on three, eh, Inspector?
Is he all right, Frank?
There's only one thing to do, Helen.
Get Sampson.
Give him up?
We can't.
But if Geoff has proof that Cobb is the murderer,
- and he has Spears as a witness...
- But how do we know he has?
It may just be his imagination.
Oh, I don't know.
- Frank?
- Better let me.
I'm sorry, Geoff, but it was necessary.
I was just keeping my promise.
That's all right.
I suppose
I drank too much.
With all the excitement, well, I passed out, didn't I?
Yes.
Sorry I can't remove those.
I feel much better with them on.
Safer.
- I'm glad you did it.
- Listen to me, Geoff.
You've got to tell me what proof you have against Cobb.
Then we can put
Sampson to work on it, and that'll leave us free to give all our time to the antidote.
Yes, of course.
That's the right idea.
I say, Frank, the wine left me awfully dry.
Do you suppose I could have some water?
Of course.
I'll get it.
Is he better, Frank?
Much. It was only a temporary attack.
He's quite normal again now.
Here you are.
Geoff! Don't!
Geoff! Geoff!
Don't!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Hello?
Open up!
Open this door!
We're police officers!
Get in that window!
What happened?
In there.
Dr. Griffin!
Good morning, Richard.
- Geoffrey!
- Don't raise your voice, Richard.
And don't touch that bell rope, or I might have to wind it around your neck.
No one can help you now except yourself.
I'm not afraid of you, Geoffrey.
Aren't you?
It's only that
I can't see you.
I'm not a coward.
You would be afraid of me if you couldn't see me.
On the contrary, it would be a pleasure, and one that I hope soon to enjoy.
Get up.
Get up!
We're going out, you and I, for a breath of fresh air.
Turn around.
Put up your arms.
Now, put them down.
So. Now walk quite naturally as if no one was with you.
Be charming and clever when you speak to the guards, and be careful, Richard.
I may press the trigger in my excitement.
Open the door.
I'm sorry, sir, but you can't leave.
But please, I... I...
I told you to act cleverly.
Surely, you can still lie.
I recall your being an expert.
Good morning, Mr. Cobb.
Good morning.
Have you been took ill?
I'm not feeling very well.
I'm just going out for some fresh air.
I'm sorry, sir.
Bill up there had no right letting you through.
Inspector's orders.
I'm not a prisoner.
I'm under protective custody.
Suppose this invisible chap is hiding about.
Aren't you afraid of that?
Why, of course not.
No more am I, sir.
Between you and me, sir,
I'll have to see him before I'll believe he's invisible.
Just to keep the record straight, sir,
I'll have Bill phone the inspector.
Bill!
Bill!
He's in the kitchen again with his head in the icebox.
You wait here a minute, sir.
I'll phone the inspector myself.
Here we are.
Recognize the place?
- Geoffrey...
- Quiet!
Good morning,
Mr. Cobb.
Good morning.
Good morning to you.
Get out.
- Geoffrey, give me a chance to explain...
- I intend to immediately. Out!
Move along now.
You'll find the key under the mat.
Unlock the door.
Light that candle.
Yes, Richard, it's your friend, Spears.
Move over to him.
I want you to take a good look at him.
Go on! Move!
Now, take the gag out of your friend's mouth.
I'm sure he wants to talk to you.
Do as I tell you!
Go on! Go on!
Please, Sir Geoffrey, let me down.
My dear, Mr. Spears, surely you can't be so exhausted already, with the rope around your neck only a few hours.
The pair of you had it around mine for months!
All right, Spears, out with it!
I said it once, and I'll say it again.
I saw Cobb do it.
Hit Sir Michael over the head with a wrench and shove him down the shaft.
He promised me money and a good position if I kept my mouth shut.
- Don't kid!
- I'm innocent!
Where is your power now?
Now I'm as invisible as you are!
I'll show you where my power is!
Take that!
I'll get you!
- What's happening?
- He's breaking the place up again.
- Who's he fighting?
- Pink elephants, as usual.
He's a proper menace, that Willie is!
May the best elephant win, eh?
Come on, Tommy, let's see what's up.
Now
I've got you, you swine!
I'll choke the life out of you!
There!
Mr. Cobb! Mr. Cobb!
Mr. Cobb!
What's he running from?
What's he running for?
Stop him!
Now I've got you!
There he is!
There he is!
Now I have you, Richard!
I'm going to force the truth out of you, too!
No one can help you now.
Halt that escalator!
- Stop it!
- Tell them you killed my brother.
Tell them you murdered Michael.
Tell them or I'll...
Don't shoot!
Michael.
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff, where are you?
Look lower in the pile.
Search with your hands, not your eyes!
- Mr. Sampson!
- What is it?
We can't find him up here, sir!
Keep on searching!
He must be about here somewhere.
Miss Manson.
Mr. Cobb is asking to see you.
I don't want to see him.
Geoffrey!
But Dr. Griffin says he's hurt very bad, miss.
Helen...
I killed...
Michael.
Do you mind if I borrow your clothes, old man?
It's cold.
I'm a bit shaky.
You don't mind, do you?
Thanks.
Nice suit of clothes you've got there.
You know, I really shouldn't do this.
I really shouldn't.
They'll be able to catch me now.
Slender waist you've got.
Not a bad fit, my friend.
You wouldn't refuse me now, old man?
Thanks.
You know, they've hunted me all over the country.
They shot me, too.
I'm a murderer.
Don't be scared, old crow, I...
I only want your clothes.
Yes, that's right.
I'll have to have your hat, too.
I'm really freezing.
Thanks for your help.
Why don't you find him?
When you thought he was a murderer, you tried every way you knew to trap him and to kill him.
But now that you know he's innocent, probably dying somewhere, alone and deserted, you've lost all interest, haven't you?
Why don't you use your cleverness now to save him?
I've got all my men out, Miss Manson.
You know what we're up against.
What is that?
What is that?
You can't see his head!
It's Geoffrey.
His pulse is almost gone.
There must have been a tremendous loss of blood.
I believe he'd stand a chance if he could have an immediate transfusion.
I'm ready.
Shall I prepare
Miss Manson for a test?
Yes, but we need more than she can supply.
- How is he? How is he?
- How is he, Doctor?
Please, please!
Sir Geoffrey has to have a blood transfusion to save his life.
- Who'll volunteer?
- I will!
Just come in quietly.
I'll have to make some tests.
Transfusion successful, Doctor?
Well, complicated.
How is he?
He'll die.
No.
Internal bleeding.
If only I could operate!
But how can I when I can't see him?
Sampson,
I'd like to try this antidote.
There's a very small chance that it'll work and a far greater one that it'll kill him.
But if I don't try it, he has no chance whatever.
Prepare a hypodermic please, nurse.
Frank! Frank!
The new blood itself was the antidote.
Helen.
Geoffrey.
Helen, darling.
Where is he? Where is he?
- Get up. Get up.
- I am up.
I was up and I've been up all night.
I would have stayed up if you hadn't knocked me down.
Well, I didn't know you were there.
If you'd come in a moment later, sir,
I wouldn't have been there.
I have handed in my notice.
Have you seen the morning paper?
After 25 years in this household,
I can't see anything, sir.
Well, just glance at that and you'll see plenty.
Must be spring again.
- I haven't had time to find out.
- Good morning.
Listen to me, you extravagant, girl-crazy young idiot.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Wow, George, new shoes?
No, sir. It's a bombproof shelter for my tootsies, sir.
- New shoes.
- Now, look here.
For 40 years I've been working myself into a nervous breakdown handling your family's affairs.
But this is the last straw.
We got off easy.
She sued for a million.
And she got
100,000 cash.
Good heavens, man.
Doesn't anything ever bother you?
No, nothing.
Besides, what's the use of worrying about something that's already happened?
Well, it won't happen again,
I'll guarantee you that.
You're broke.
- Definitely?
- Definitely.
And you've got to get away from all this.
No more girls and no more parties.
And no more
Prof. Gibbs.
Gibbs. Hmm.
You'll pardon me, sir, but that should have occurred long ago.
Gibbs. Say, that reminds me.
He called me up this morning and asked for $3,000.
Write him out a check, will you?
Three thousand dollars for that...
That...
- Crackpot.
- Thank you.
You've already wasted a fortune on his silly ideas.
And none of them are any good, excepting the rat trap and then he was right at home.
You can't expect me to brush off the professor just like that.
He's practically an heirloom.
I inherited him from Dad.
What has he invented in the last 10 years?
Not a darn thing.
Now he's got to stop draining your bank account.
Thousands for chemicals, bulbs, bulbs, chemicals.
- What for?
- Well, he must be inventing something.
But what?
I don't know. I never ask him.
Now you sit down there and write that scatterbrain professor that he's had the last penny he's ever going to get from you.
May I help you, sir?
Oh, this makes me very happy.
I'm sure you won't regret this move, sir, at all.
Oh! You make it strong, sir, and I'll withdraw my resignation.
Stop breathing down my neck.
It's the breath of pleasure, sir.
And perhaps a touch of garlic.
George, are you sick?
Me, sir?
No, sir.
Stick out your tongue.
Give that to the professor.
Thank you, sir.
What is this, Halloween?
Prof. Gibbs?
Go away.
Now, now, Professor.
It's only me, Mrs. Jackson.
Hmm. You will find Mrs.
Jackson in the kitchen where she belongs.
Professor, you drank it.
Have a touch of indigestion this morning.
Well, here's a note from Mr. Russell.
Huh? Hold this.
Yes. This... This will be the check for 3,000.
There's no check.
Nothing at all.
Dear, dear, dear.
You stay here, Mrs. Jackson.
I've got to run into town.
Into town?
What'll I do with this?
Hold it carefully.
It might explode.
Morning paper.
My... My ad. My... My ad.
I want to change it, please.
That's fine.
We only run a couple of thousand ads a day.
Have you got a receipt?
A receipt? A...
Would that be a little piece of paper?
Oh, yeah.
I seem to remember putting it in my wallet.
You know, I can never find my...
Oh, here it is.
Here. It's... Look.
Would...
Would that be it?
It's it. P-19.
I was just going to send it through.
That's what I call a coincidence.
Eh? A remarkable one, really.
You really want this in?
Yes, of course.
Unless you would like to try the experiment.
No, no. No, thank you.
Ah...
No sense of adventure.
Put yourself in the garage, lazy bones.
Hey, Professor. What's the big idea?
That car went in by itself.
A little invention of mine.
Dear me. You look enough like Dick Russell to be his brother.
Oh, come out of it, Prof.
I am Dick Russell.
No, no. He wouldn't be going fishing and he wouldn't be up this early.
I'm sorry I couldn't send you that money
I promised.
It's not that I've lost faith in you or anything, but it's simply that I'm flat busted.
Busted? Good. Wonderful.
Come into the lab, quick.
Well, they're all open.
Now will you tell me what they are?
Answers to my ad
I put in the paper.
My boy, all your troubles are over.
You'll make millions out of this. Millions.
Millions out of what?
Come on, come on.
Help me, uh...
Help me pick the victim.
You know, a peculiar fellow took my ad.
Thought I was cuckoo.
Anything in yours?
"I'm willing to undergo experiment
"if you will deposit
$100,000 to my account."
They all think I'm crazy.
I can't understand it.
- You believe I can do it, don't you?
- Do what?
Make people invisible.
- What?
- Invisible.
With my new machine over there.
It absolutely works.
You know,
I tried it on the cat.
There's the cat.
Of course there's the cat.
I only gave her a slight treatment.
Wears off after a while.
If only I could get a person to try it on.
Hey, wait a minute.
Listen to this.
"I am willing to submit to your experiment on Friday afternoon.
"Please let me know your address.
"K. Carroll,
1132 North Vista."
Eureka.
In return for all you've done for me, your fortune is made.
You're a millionaire, starting tomorrow.
You mean, I'll see the positive proof tomorrow?
Hmm. I mean, you won't see it.
I won't see it?
Ah!
Kitty, K. Carroll is going to join your club.
Hey, John. John.
- About this inventory...
- Hang the inventory.
Congratulate me, man.
I'm practically a millionaire.
- Have you gone mad?
- No.
- Got everything packed, George?
- Yes, sir. Everything.
Furniture is in order, silverware stored, trunks packed, pictures all covered.
Well, that's fine.
You can put everything back now.
Very good, sir.
Did you say,
"Put everything back"?
I certainly did.
We're not leaving.
We're not leaving.
We're...
Mrs. House...
Housekeeper.
Housekeeper.
Housekeeper.
Jackson is the name.
I've been with you for 12 years and the name's still Jackson.
Hmm. Mrs. Jackson, tomorrow I am expecting a gentleman,
Mr. K. Carroll.
Bring him right in here to me.
Don't mention a word of this to anybody.
Keep it a dead secret.
And see that this is mailed to him at once.
And take a very good look at him because you won't see him again.
It's the mail, Mrs. Patten.
I'll get it. I'm expecting a letter.
All right, honey.
Hello, Mr. Postman.
Have you got a letter for me?
- K. Carroll?
- That's it. Thank you very, very much.
Oh!
Oh! Have you got a feller?
Hooray! He's made an appointment.
Oh, then you have got a feller.
This isn't from a fella, Mrs. Patten.
This is the call to adventure.
What would you do if you could completely disappear?
Don't tell me you're thinking about running out on me when your room rent's way past due?
Oh, I...
I hate to bring it up, but after all,
I've got to live, you know.
Live.
Get up in the morning, run for the subway, punch the clock, get kicked around all day by that nasty little Mr. Growley, punch the clock, run for the subway and go to bed.
Dream about the subway.
You're gonna dream yourself out of your job if you don't get going.
Oh, dear, the time clock. Bye.
Come on now, girls. Hurry up.
- Kitty, you're late.
- You're telling me.
Someday, ducky, I'm gonna give you a real punch, right in the nose.
- Kitty, what kept you?
- My mail.
I never get any mail.
All I get is a cold in my head.
Here, dear.
You're wearing number 37.
Oh, Kitty, hurry.
What are you thinking of?
What would you do if you could become invisible?
Kitty, do you feel all right?
I feel as though I'm just ready to take the plunge.
Hurry, Kitty.
I will.
All right, all right.
Pay attention. Quit daydreaming.
Now remember.
We're not in business for your amusement.
Every minute wasted means money lost.
Every second delay keeps a buyer waiting.
Eyes front, chin up, shoulders back.
- Where's number 37?
- Oh, coming right out, Mr. Growley.
All right, Carroll.
Don't try to sneak by.
You were two minutes late this morning.
You're docked an hour's pay.
That's unfair.
I've never been late before.
And besides, two minutes is exactly one 30th of an hour.
Well, really, Carroll?
Maybe you'd like to take up bookkeeping, somewhere else.
Well, would you?
- Well, I didn't mean...
- That's better.
- And you?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Growley.
I have a cold in my head.
You sniffle in front of customers, you're fired.
Oh, Mr. Growley.
Suppose you mind your own business,
Mrs. Bates.
There are plenty of younger women for your job.
Yes, sir.
Now I know what I'd do.
I'd kick him right in the pants.
All right.
Get going, everybody.
Good morning.
Good morning. Good morning.
I'm sure you'll like our new showing.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
How are you?
How do you do?
- This is our new dinner dress.
- Smile.
Turn around, show the back, little lady.
Let me see that.
How much?
Hey, take it easy, will you?
- What's that?
- They tore it.
- Mr. Growley, I came here to do business.
- Not be insulted.
Please, ladies.
Please.
Of course the girl is wrong and she'll apologize to you, or I shall have to dismiss her.
- They tore it.
- Apologize. The customer's always right.
This time the customers happen to be wrong, aren't they, girls?
Since you three stick together so well, you can be fired together.
Or do you apologize?
- I apologize.
- All right. You can go.
And now, ladies, while the little models are making their change,
I'd like to show you some new material.
- Kitty, what are you doing?
- I'm leaving.
We can't go on being stepped on like this for 16.50 a week.
Docked when we're sick, docked when we're late.
Treated like dogs, yelled at, humiliated.
It's time one of us showed
Growley where he gets off.
He works for a living like all the rest of us.
It's time he behave like a human being.
But what are you gonna do?
Where you gonna go?
I'll be back.
And if I have any luck, nobody will see me.
- Prof. Gibbs, please.
- Who shall I say is calling?
Miss Growley...
I mean, Miss Carroll.
I came to...
I mean, I came in answer to an ad.
Would you tell
Prof. Growley...
I mean, Prof. Gibbs that I'm here?
Step in.
There's a person outside, Professor, to see you about your ad.
- Good. Send him in.
- It's a her.
A her?
- You mean, skirts and things?
- Mmm. Skirts and things.
Mrs. Jackson, you're letting me down.
I can't possibly perform my experiment unless the subject doesn't wear a...
Hasn't any... Is...
Is, you know, in the...
In the "altogether," as it were.
- What am I going to do?
- Well, how should I know?
Dear, dear.
I can't afford to lose her.
I mean, I might never find another.
- I have it. You tell her.
- Tell her what?
About the, uh, disrobing.
Tell her it's purely in the interest of science.
You know, we can put her behind the screen.
And nothing could be more proper.
And, of course, during the experiment, you'll stay right here.
Well, I don't know as I want to see folks get invisible.
Might give me a turn.
It's her or you, Mrs. Jackson.
Take your choice.
You're either victim or chaperone.
All right, all right.
I'll tell her.
Be careful of this.
It belongs to my roommate.
And this, too.
Also these.
The shoes are mine, though.
She gave them to me.
- May I come in?
- Yes, we're ready for you now.
How's the visibility today, Prof?
You know, you didn't tell me that, uh...
In your letter that you were a girl.
Well, I wanted to be sure it wasn't one of those "for girls only" propositions.
I expected a man, but you'll do.
Give me your arm.
Ouch!
- Is that all there is to it?
- Oh, no.
We have to treat the body externally as well.
Will it hurt?
Oh. Will it hurt?
Not at all.
Perhaps a slight tickling sensation for a minute or two.
Oh, good.
I don't tickle easily.
All ready to begin.
Ah...
Uh, now wait a minute.
This won't make me invisible forever, will it?
Oh, no. Just for a few hours.
Just what I want.
Go ahead. Shoot.
Are you quite sure you're willing to go through with this?
- I said, shoot.
- Because, you know, it'll work.
It really doesn't hurt.
No, but it tickles.
I'll say it does.
Ooh, you look like a custard pie.
Am I dissolving yet?
- That's that.
- She's gone.
Don't you dare come back here.
Why? Is something still showing?
Well, I can't see anything, but... but how do I know you can't?
Here, here.
Take this.
Try and take a good look at yourself.
I really am invisible.
There, Mrs. Jackson.
Do you see?
No. No, I don't.
Not a darn thing.
Wait till I call Dick over.
It's a staggering success.
- Sit down, Miss...
- Kitty. Kitty Carroll.
Make yourself at home.
I'll be right back.
- You watch her, Mrs. Jackson.
- Watch what?
Seven years bad luck.
Now, don't you come near me, miss.
Don't worry, cutie.
I'm going away from you.
- But Professor said you were to stay here.
- Not me.
Growley, Growley.
Here I come.
Oh!
Excuse me, sir.
The professor just phoned.
He said, would you come over right away?
He said to tell you that he has done it.
- That's great.
- Now wait, just a minute.
No, I can't.
I've got to go over and not see somebody.
Pardon, sir.
Would you care to not have a cup of tea?
Eh...
Now then, Richard, I will show you she has completely disappeared.
- Professor...
- Go away.
Don't interrupt.
You bore me.
- Now, can you see anyone?
- Neither hide nor hair.
- Uh, did you say, "she"?
- Yeah.
Permit me to introduce you.
Ah... Miss Carroll, allow me to present Dick Russell, my young friend and patron.
Dick, this is Miss Kitty Carroll.
Don't be afraid.
- Shake hands.
- Shake hands with what?
Come, come, Miss Kitty.
Shake hands. Say hello.
- Really, she was here.
- Sure, sure. Of course she was.
- Maybe you better lie down for a while.
- Lie down? What nonsense!
Good heavens.
Maybe some reaction I didn't foresee.
Maybe she's fainted.
Where... Where are you, Miss... Miss Carroll?
Miss...
Where are you, Kitty?
Kitty, Kitty.
Kitty? Kitty.
Not you.
Miss Carroll.
Avast. Avant.
Out of me way.
"Thou troublest me.
Thy bones are marrowless."
Kitty.
Oh. Oh, there you are, sir.
You'll be pleased to know that the silverware is back from the bank, the trunks are all unpacked and the slipcovers are off throughout the entire house.
Yeah.
That's fine, George.
- We're closing up after all.
- Very good, sir.
We're what?
Mrs. Jackson.
Mrs. Jackson!
- What do you want?
- What have you done with her?
- What have I done?
- She's gone!
Of course, she's gone.
That's what I tried to tell you.
- Where? Where? Where? Where?
- How do I know?
- Didn't she say anything?
- Yes.
She said, "Growley, Growley.
Here I come."
But that...
That doesn't make sense.
"Growley, Growley. Here I... "
"Growley, Growley." Growley?
Come, come, Mrs. Bates.
I'll finish that for you.
Snuffling and sniffling in the buyers' faces.
Go on, get your things and get out. You're fired.
Please, Mr. Growley.
Don't fire me.
Let me come back when I get rid of this cold in my head.
You'll never come back.
You're fired.
Eyes front, chin up, shoulders back.
Come on. Get going.
Growley.
Growley. You miserable, wicked man.
Bullying poor little working girls, firing them, docking them and enjoying it.
You're docking a girl to pay for this too, aren't you?
The day of reckoning has come.
Now you'll see how it feels when the shoe's on the other foot.
Oh, Mr. Growley.
If a girl's late, you fine her.
If a girl's got a cold, you fire her.
You certainly do things the hard way.
There it goes.
And maybe you should be sent after it.
- Please, whoever you are...
- I am the voice of your conscience.
Lean over the windowsill, Growley.
- Oh, I...
- I said, lean over.
Eyes front, Mr. Growley.
Chin up.
Shoulder's back, you worm.
You've always had a kick coming.
And here's one for interest, and one to grow on.
There. You've had that coming to you for a long time.
I'm sick of you,
Mr. Growley, and I'm sick of getting in and out of these crummy dresses!
I'm sick of leering men buyers and snooty women buyers.
I'm sick of the whole thing!
Well, well. If it isn't my old pal, the time clock.
Here's something to remember me by.
Paper! Paper!
Evening paper!
How do you do?
I should like some information regarding a personal advertisement.
Sorry, sir, but personal means personal.
Stick 'em up!
Oh, go on home to your mother.
- I ain't got a mother.
- But I got a gun.
All right, boys. What do you want?
There's only 37.50 in the cash box.
We don't want cash.
We want the address of an ad.
The ad about being made invisible.
That one was put in by a loony called Gibbs.
Gibbs? Where do we find him?
In the bughouse by rights, but I've got his address.
Gimme that!
Pick 'em up, butterfingers!
That's the kinda help you get nowadays.
This is the joint.
Say, where did you get this car?
I didn't get it.
Hammerhead got it.
Why'd you do that?
- Where did you get this car?
- Oh, I just picked it up.
Nice pickings.
Shh.
Say, what are we gonna talk to this professor about anyway?
It don't make no difference, as long as you get the layout of the invisible machine.
You're a scientist, Foghorn.
You're a smooth talker.
- Here, you better take this with ya.
- Put that away.
Scientists don't carry tommy-guns.
Say, maybe we should've brought a butterfly net.
Don't trouble,
Mrs. Jackson.
I have nothing more important to do than answer the door.
Suit yourself.
Let me in quickly, Professor.
Go away! I am not speaking to you!
Oh, don't be an old stuffed shirt.
I had to go and smack down the boss.
A fine reason for becoming invisible.
The only reason.
Jobs are scarce, and I can't afford to be fired.
Listen, Professor,
I've got to warn you that...
I am not interested.
I am highly displeased with you.
Have I the honor of addressing
Professor Gibbs?
My name is Hardwick Spencer.
I'm a fellow scientist.
I represent a group in Mexico.
- Good, sir. Come right in.
- Thank you.
Go away!
- Now, wait...
- Not you, sir. Her!
- Her? Who's her?
- My first subject.
And I am annoyed with her and I wash me hands of her.
You mean, you've already tried the experiment and it works?
- And how?
- Don't pay any attention to her.
I'll gladly show you the machine.
Sir, I suppose you will be convinced by a demonstration.
That's exactly the idea.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
- Mexico? Why, no.
- Oh, you'll like it.
A fine trip.
And the boys...
My associates will give you a royal welcome.
Thank you for the invitation.
Invitation, my eye.
I saw them drive up.
They have guns.
- Mr. Spencer...
- That's a lie!
Is it? Professor, ask him how he knew where to find you.
Why, he saw the advertisement in the paper.
- Of course, I did.
- Naughty, naughty!
The ad didn't give the professor's name or address.
She's right. How did you find me, if I'm not too personal?
- Why, I...
- You're a crook.
I'm a crook.
No, I'm a scientist!
Back to Mexico, you wolf in scientist's clothing!
Take it away! Don't do that!
Take it away!
And don't you come back, or I'll cut you dead.
Well, I suppose I should be grateful to you for disposing of him like that.
Thank you and good-bye.
Oh, come on, Professor.
Be a sport and forgive me.
Haven't I proved your experiment a success?
I knew that beforehand.
I merely wished to utilize you to convince somebody.
Gosh, I am sorry.
Well, is there time to show me to this somebody before I get visible again?
Just about.
I'll tell him we're coming over.
Dick Russell, please.
Tell him it's Professor Gibbs.
- Now what are you doing?
- I'm dodging the draft.
The man from Mars,
Professor Gibbs, sir.
Pardon sir. He seems to have passed out...
Seems to be out, sir.
What? Tell...
You're materializing.
- Go get your clothes on.
- Oh!
- My clothes are on!
- Nonsense.
- They're behind the screen.
- What screen?
He seems to be on one of those things again, sir.
- He's nuts.
- He says you're nuts.
What?
Tell him a slight complication has arisen.
The girl came back, but now she's materialized.
If I can persuade her to get undressed again,
I'll bring her right over.
The girl?
Bring her over undressed?
Why, Professor,
I'm ashamed of you!
Now what's up?
It's too delicate to repeat, sir.
But part of it was that he would bring the girl over.
Oh, no, he isn't!
We're leaving right now for the lodge.
We'll leave right now for the lodge?
You mean to say, I have to cover up everything else again, sir?
- Certainly, you have to cover it up.
- Oh, don't say that, sir.
Why don't you give the moths a holiday, sir?
I've been in service for 25 years, and I never...
I resign again, sir, and again.
And again, and again.
Sometimes I suspect that man of his isn't all there.
On the other hand, you are.
What could have gone wrong, I wonder?
You're not supposed to be visible for another hour.
Well, I'm sorry,
Professor, but at least I'll get back to work so I can check out.
Yes, I suppose you must, though it's very awkward for me. Very!
Years of work, taking all that money from him.
Never be able to pay him now.
He'll think I'm balmy!
This would have solved everything.
Dear, dear, dear, dear.
Stop. You're breaking my heart.
What you want me to do, be invisible again?
Yes! But you wouldn't.
I don't suppose
I should expect...
But if you could get the rest of the day off...
Okay,
I'll try Growley.
You are the nicest visible
I have ever met.
And we'll abolish the time clock, too.
And, Mrs. Bates, don't forget to call the little lady with the cold, and tell her to stay in bed until it's better.
- She can have her job back anytime.
- Yes, sir.
That's all, my dears, except that in the future we'll serve tea every afternoon at 4:00.
You'll all like that, won't you?
Yes, Mr. Growley.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to answer my phone.
What's happened to Mr. Growley?
Hello, Miss Carroll.
How are you, my dear child?
Yes, of course this is Mr. Growley.
Why, you needn't have bothered to ask at all.
Certainly. Of course.
Take the whole weekend if you like.
And have a lovely time.
Bye-bye, my dear, and have fun.
How am I doin'?
It's you, Professor.
You reformed Growley.
In the name of all the working girls, I thank you.
Now, now, I haven't time for this sort of thing.
You promised to be invisible again.
Okay, Professor.
You won't be seeing me in a few minutes.
He can't do this to me!
Hold my hat, Professor.
Dick! Richard! Wait!
Wait, stop! Stop!
Richard, you can't do this.
- Where are you going?
- To the lodge, fishing.
- Fishing? What for?
- Fish.
Fi-esh, fish.
Fish!
And me with an invisible woman for him not to see.
Hello? Yeah, this is Foghorn.
What?
It's the boss.
The boss?
Not in town?
Great to hear your voice, boss.
Where you talkin' from?
Oh, you're still down there, huh? Well.
He's still in Mexico.
Well, we tried to get it, but we met with kind of a complication.
Well, I'll complicate the three of you into such small pieces, your own mother couldn't put you together again.
I want to be invisible, so I can go home.
I got to see the old home town again.
I got to smell the lake.
I got to hear traffic.
I'm homesick.
- Now he's crying.
- Gosh, that's bad.
Last time he cried, we had to have that triple funeral.
Now, we'll get that machine or bust.
But how we gonna get it over the border?
That's your worry, fathead!
Nobody understands me.
I'm sensitive.
That's what I am.
- Ever been to the big town?
- No, señor.
I can almost hear the Elevated right now, the taxi drivers bawling each other out, the cash register in the Gay Paree, and the way the newsies used to holler headlines the morning after we pulled a big job.
Señor, I do not know anything about that, but I have never heard of a chemical formula that would make the human body unseen.
Watch your step, O'Klotz.
You're talking to a lonesome guy, and a homesick guy, too.
My gang's on the trail of an invisible machine, see?
Si, si.
- And they're rushing it down here, see?
- Si, si.
You are going to set it up and make it work, see?
Si, si.
Or you'll have to find the formula how to put yourself together again, see?
Si, si.
What is all this, "Si, si"?
Are you Spanish?
I'm a Pomeranian!
Fishy, fishy in the brook, master caught him with a hook.
Cooky fries him in a pan.
Phooey! What a smell!
What a pull, but here we are.
What very superior mountains!
Yeah. There's a very superior bush for you to undress behind.
What for?
I don't want anyone but Richard to know that you're here.
Oh, come on, let me go in this way and scare him to death!
Do as I say, or when I bring you to,
I will give you the wrong face.
Hurry up.
Why couldn't you have done this in the desert?
It certainly would have been warmer.
Ouch!
Darn those roses!
Watch where you're going, will you, Philo?
Who could that be at this hour of the night, disturbing my culinary art?
- Hurry up. There's somebody coming.
- Kind of chilly.
I wonder how the nudists stand it.
Shh!
Oh. Oh, it's you.
Yes, it's me, sunshine.
I thought we'd drop in on young Richard for a bit.
"We"?
Uh, "we" in the sense of visiting royalty.
Hmm.
That door, you know, the hinges need a little oiling, my boy.
Nonsense. The hinges were oiled this morning.
Oh. I suppose the cat needs oiling too.
Cats and I are mutually allergic.
Queer, isn't it?
Very, considering you have one at home.
Hmm.
Not that I care, but are you feeling all right?
I've never felt better in me life.
A little cold coming on.
Beastly weather.
Isn't it?
Mr. Russell likes it.
He says it makes the fish bite better.
You'll pardon an old-fashioned hint, but we weren't expecting company up here.
As soon as I have elucidated matters with Richard, we will pop off.
Why do you keep saying "we"?
I am referring to the editorial "we."
Did something come down the chimney?
Perhaps it was Santa Claus.
Oh, yes, perhaps it was.
There is no Santa Claus!
That's right, there isn't, is there?
Months too early for him.
- Now, what was that?
- Mice.
Mice! We never had mice here before!
Hang up my coat for me, will you, my dear fellow?
- Stop that, will you?
- I can't help it. I'm freezing.
Behave yourself!
Nothing like a spot of brandy on a damp night.
Nothing like making yourself at home, either.
Hmm.
What...
Did you shoot that elk?
No, I think it was born there.
- What goes on...
- Have one with me.
Well, thank you.
Perhaps I'd better.
Maybe I...
Thank you. Thank you.
My. Went down the wrong way, huh?
That's good.
I hope you don't choke.
Thank you.
That's enough, old man.
What are you, a ventriloquist?
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes.
That's right, of course.
Ventriloquism. I...
I remember I picked it up at college, from the fellow next door.
Well, for a minute you had me worried there.
- Do you see what I see?
- He also dabbled in magic.
Help! Help!
Mr. Russell!
Spooks! Spooks,
Mr. Russell!
Really, Miss Kitty?
You have no control
I'm too cold to have any control.
Ah, well, if you're cold,
I suppose you'll have to put something on.
Now...
I wouldn't drink too much if I were you.
Why not?
It warms me up.
There is no telling what reaction alcohol may have upon your invisibility.
Now...
It's raining.
I'll have to bring your things in before they get soaked.
Here, take this, will you?
Mr. Russell. Mr. Russell.
Mr. Russell.
- What's the matter with you?
- The professor is up here, sir.
- The professor. Here?
- Yes, and he's acting very peculiarly, sir.
I... I... Frankly,
I'm frightened.
Well now, George, we both know he's cracked.
What's he doing?
I don't know what he's doing now, but just a minute ago, sir, while I was in there, he was trying to...
He had a...
It was a long...
It came out of a...
I don't know, sir.
Now, it can't be as bad as that.
Yes, please, come on and let me show you.
Will you please,
Mr. Russell?
All I ask is a little cooperation.
Do you see what I mean, sir?
- Where'd those clothes come from?
- They're his.
- You're sure you're all right?
- Oh, sir!
- Well, we'll just have to humor him.
- Yes, yes, sir.
- And you too.
- Ye... Oh, Mr. Russell.
Oh, Professor.
Well, a new tailor,
Professor?
Aye? What...
Oh, well, my boy, I, uh...
The rain, you know. I...
I was afraid of catching cold.
It's good you brought something to change into.
Huh? Uh...
Oh! Oh, they're not mine.
No, no, no, of course, my dear boy, I...
I can quickly explain if, uh, if I can see you alone for a moment.
- Alone, eh? What for?
- I've done it, my lad!
I've brought her!
She's here.
Now just take it easy,
Professor, and everything'll be all right.
Mr. Russell! Look!
There it goes again!
Stop staring, stupid.
Give him this.
Go on, give it to him.
Here, George. Up!
Here.
I hope you're ashamed of yourself, young woman.
- Young?
- Of course I'm young.
Now, now, you don't need another drink.
You haven't fainted!
Okay. Here, handsome.
You don't look so hot yourself.
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.
Oh. Drinks, decanters, ventriloquists, magicians...
Come on, George.
Pull yourself together.
Tell him it's nothing supernatural.
Just a simple little invention.
Oh, oh, oh. I beg your pardon, sir.
I shouldn't have given way this way. I should...
Look now, sir!
Flying cats!
Sure I can fly.
Here, catch him!
Talking cats!
Oh, here I go again, folks.
Whoever heard of such a thing?
It's only an invisible girl talking.
Come on, George, get hold of yourself.
Go on up and lie down.
Oh, thank you, sir.
It would be a pleasure.
I've been in service all my life.
My father's been in service before me.
And I've never been implicated in such a mess...
Professor, I owe you an apology.
I thought you were crazy.
I never dreamed...
Oh, I still don't believe it.
Say, Professor, is this the guy who's going to promote your cute little machine?
Ah, uh, yes, yes, of course.
Pardon me.
Uh, uh, Miss Carroll, Mr. Richard Russell.
- How do you do?
- I don't think much of him.
He's no businessman.
He's a playboy.
I've seen his pictures in the papers.
Ah, they call him
"The Patsy of the Pacific."
Yeah? Well, listen,
Miss Nothing.
I'll have you know
I'm perfectly capable of handling any business deals of any kind or size.
Oh, I see.
It's only women you can't handle.
Yeah, beautiful women.
But then you wouldn't know anything about that.
Oh, is that so?
Sure, any girl who'd become invisible can't be very easy on the eyes.
Professor, I insist on being visible again right now!
Impossible, my dear. You will have to wait until morning.
Hey, look out!
You'll stay good and invisible till then.
I wasn't taking any chances.
Besides, you'd hardly want to take shape before your clothes dry.
You... You don't mean she's really...
Yeah, I mean she's really.
Hey, hey, no, you don't!
I better make you some strong coffee.
I don't know what's the matter.
I never liked to drink before.
Fight the impulse, young woman.
That desire must be caused by something in the treatment.
Well, well! Now I know the meaning of the expression, "Alone at last."
Hey, you almost stepped on me.
Why don't you carry a red lantern or something, or at least put some clothes on so I can see where you're not?
But then you're hiding your stylish, stout figure.
I'll spike that ugly rumor in three hooks and a zipper.
Darn it, they're still soaked.
- How very convenient.
- At least the stockings are dry.
Now to find my feet.
This is worse than dressing in the dark.
There.
Now, we'll see who's stalling.
It so happens that by profession I'm a model.
What for, piano legs?
Any time you hear of a piano with legs like mine, sonny, run, do not walk, to your nearest music store.
There.
Apologies are now in order.
Does the rest of you follow that same interesting pattern?
None of your business.
- Well, now where are you?
- At the end of the cigarette.
You know, when it rains like this, all the roads around here get washed out.
So, you and the professor better plan to spend the night.
Just because I have good-looking legs?
No, because the roads are washed out.
Besides, the professor and I have all this business to discuss.
And because I have good-looking legs.
If I knew where your neck was,
I'd wring it.
I think I'll have just another little one.
Oh, I feel dizzy.
It must be the altitude.
Sure, altitude.
Spelled B-R-A-N-D-Y.
Call the professor.
Everything's spinning.
- Hey, Professor!
- What? What?
- What's the matter?
- She says it's the altitude.
She says? Quick. We'll have to get her to bed.
Okay, let me.
I... Uh-oh.
- I forgot she's...
- Yeah, she certainly is.
Come on, hold out your arm.
I can't stand up on my good-looking legs.
Whoopee!
That's all right.
Just a little too much altitude.
- Better take her to the showers.
- Mmm.
Upsy-daisy.
Not very heavy.
You think you're a great big strong man.
We better get her to bed.
- Hey, what's going on here?
- I'm leaving, sir, without notice.
Ah, don't be ridiculous.
You're getting to be a problem child.
Either the professor goes or I go.
He has a personality like a temporary filling.
Now, the professor's just an old...
I don't mind pole vaulting decanters and flying cats, but when it comes to invisible women...
George, this invention means a lot of money to me.
When I start paying you again,
I'll give you a raise.
- What?
- A raise.
Oh, well, thank you.
That's well worth looking forward to.
I'll reconsider.
You know something,
I can hardly wait to see her face.
Most fortunately for you, sir, this one is invisible, and I sincerely hope she remains that way.
Why?
Because looking at a woman is only the first step to trouble.
You look, she smiles.
You soften, she sues.
Invisible women!
These days you can't believe your own eyes, even if you don't see anything.
- Oh...
- Shh!
Just stop that!
Do you want them down here?
Be quiet.
Oh, my bunion.
Hey! That's it.
- Why didn't you...
- I didn't do it on purpose.
Pardon me.
Come on!
Look, a safe.
Ooh, boy, look how it goes around and in and out and down and up.
Gosh, just like the world of tomorrow.
Come on, come on, get busy.
Take it apart, but slow, so I can diagram how to put it back together again.
But keep it quiet. Shh.
Help! Police!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, let me out! Oh!
George.
Here I am.
Oh!
Your breakfast, sir.
George, the professor said she'd be visible this morning.
If she is,
I'll be invisible by tonight.
- Let's take a look.
- Oh, please,
- let well enough be well enough.
- Shh.
Oh, my goodness.
Doggone it. Where is she?
Look, sir.
Aw, Kitty.
Why don't you both come in and then knock?
Oh, my head.
My head.
Pardon me, madame, you haven't any head.
That's what you think.
It's as big as all outdoors.
Oh, dear, I...
I need an aspirin.
Get me a nurse. Get me a doctor.
Get me something.
Oh, where's the professor?
George, we better get the professor.
What for? To cheer up a lot of bedclothes?
- Professor!
- Professor!
Oh, Professor!
Oh, Professor!
- Professor!
- Hey, Professor!
- Oh, Professor!
- Professor!
Oh, darn it.
I'm still invisible.
- Professor!
- Hey, Professor!
- Professor!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Professor!
- Professor!
- Hey, Professor!
- Oh, Professor, where are you?
Professor!
- Professor!
- Professor!
Did someone say, "Professor"?
- No.
- It's me, Kitty.
I thought I heard somebody.
Professor, look at me.
I can't see me at all.
Ah.
That's too bad. By George, I was right!
I warned you to go easy on the spirits.
How right you were!
When there is an affinity between two molecular forces and the natural reagent is chemically counter...
Aw, have a heart, Professor.
Well, there is the result.
Chemically invisible.
Stop broadcasting.
I simply refuse to stay this way.
- Now what's the matter?
- I stubbed my toe.
Professor.
Dear Professor, you've got to get me out of this, please!
- I've got to be visible!
- Yes, think of my suspense.
Yeah, we'll rush back to my laboratory, and I'll fix you up.
George, pack everything up.
We're leaving.
Yeah, we'll all rush, eh, Richard?
Let's get a move on.
I'm tired of being a piece of laundry.
Your car is ready, Miss.
- It says here we're in Mexico.
- I know that.
You don't think that guy at the customs gate was speaking Gaelic.
Hey, boys!
It's all right.
It's Foghorn.
All right, boys, get those crates off, but treat them gently.
- Got it, huh?
- You bet, boss.
There it is, right down to the last gadget.
Yeah, and I've got it diagrammed on paper and everything.
- The... The machine!
- It's gone!
Maybe it's made itself invisible.
That's hardly possible.
And I wonder what that was.
If you had any sense, you'd look and see.
Mrs. Jackson!
Really, Mrs. Jackson!
What an odd place to spend the night.
The formula for the injection!
Richard, help me.
Quick, quick!
They can't use the machine without these.
- What luck!
- What do you mean, "luck"?
What about me?
Do I have to go through the rest of my life like this?
Really, Professor,
I think she looks much better like this.
You have a nerve, you fishless fisherman!
Now children, children.
What are you gonna do about me?
Experiment till I find out what's keeping you invisible so long.
Yes, but how long's that gonna take you?
I haven't a notion.
It took me 10 years to perfect the machine...
Ah...
Now what are you laughing at?
The chap who took it without the injection, you know.
Oh, my dear, that machine is apt to do the strangest things to people.
Ah. Señor, this machine,
I love her!
She's so beautiful.
If only I could to meet the man who make her,
I would kiss him,
I think.
Just stick to business.
If it works, I'll kiss him for you.
Thank you, señor.
Ah.
She is ready,
I think.
You think.
You boys sure about the dame it made invisible?
- Sure, boss, positive.
- Oh, Foghorn seen her!
Okay. Foghorn, you're elected.
You see, I told you.
Boss...
I don't want to be invisible.
You heard me.
First we will start with the head.
Never mind the head.
That's useless.
Well, then we will start with the neck.
Good.
Boss...
What about...
Oh, no, boss.
Foghorn understands those things.
- He's scientific!
- I'm underweight.
- Foghorn!
- I am.
There's not many people
I'd let try this machine first.
Now get going!
Uh, thanks, boss.
That's great.
Señor Foghorn, in back of the screen, please.
In back of the screen?
- Si, si.
- Okay.
Now get going.
How does it feel?
- He likes it.
- He always likes it when he's lit up.
- But I can still see him.
- So can I!
- So can I!
- So can O'Klotz.
Something that should be here is missing, I think.
I thought you guys got everything!
Oh, we did, boss.
Didn't we, Foghorn?
Why, sure, we did.
What's that?
I said, "Sure, we did."
Or did I?
Something has gone wrong,
I think.
Hey, you!
Give me back my pipes!
You let go of me and I'll fight the pack of you!
Let go of him.
Ooh!
Take him down to the cellar and let him cool off, and then you do what you should have done in the first place.
You guys go back and get me the professor, or I'll have all of you singing soprano.
Yeah, boss.
- Get his head.
- I got it.
Fires in July. You are fussy.
You're a nuisance, that's what you are.
An invisible female nuisance.
I, uh... I didn't know you two were talking.
- We're not.
- We're not.
Uh, why the fire?
Well, there were so many cracks about how awful my dress looked without a head.
I took it off.
But Tarzan over there is still as disagreeable as ever.
Oh, well, you can both cheer up because I think I found the formula to make you visible again.
- Oh, Professor!
- That's swell.
So Dick will be on his way to Washington with the patents, and you'll never have to see each other again.
Isn't that nice?
So, uh, try and put up with each other for just a little while longer. Hmm?
Hmm.
So you're going to Washington, huh?
Yes.
What's it to you?
You should have been there years ago.
You've got the personality of a politician.
For a person with no personality at all, you've got no right to talk.
And stop crying.
I'm not crying.
I sniffled.
Even invisible ladies can have manners.
Use your handkerchief.
I'm no kangaroo.
I haven't got pockets in my skin.
Well, here, use mine.
Ouch!
I'm sorry.
Did I hurt you?
Well, did I?
I shook my head.
I can't see that.
- Wait a minute.
- Where are you going?
I got an idea that will change the whole complexion of this thing.
Professor's not the only inventor around here.
Put this on.
- Why?
- Well, at least I can see you nod.
- No, that looks silly.
- It's the way they're wearing them.
Stand up so I can see what you look like.
Is that all the taller you are?
Oh, silly, I'm only trying to find out which is the front of this thing.
- Is this better?
- Much.
What color did you say your eyes were?
Well, if you're so interested, why don't you stick around and find out?
That's just what
I'm going to do.
Hey!
Uh, that's my hand, you know.
Yeah, I know. Do you mind if I borrow it for a minute?
Mmm-mmm.
It's a very nice hand.
It's very soft.
Mmm-hmm.
Very pleasant to the taste.
Um, why do you close your eyes?
I can't see you.
I can at least imagine.
I know, I'm just a ghost where you're concerned.
I'm nothing but a nothing.
If this hand is any criterion, you must have lovely lips, beautiful hair, nice...
Thank you, Richard.
That's a very charming compliment.
- Oh, it's you.
- Look, reagent to counteract alcohol.
Kitty, my girl, I'll have you visible before you can say Jack...
Robinson.
I'm almost afraid to be myself.
It's... It's like making a blind date.
What have you got to lose?
You've already seen me.
You know, in a way, Richard,
I'm sorry to do this.
You know, if more women were invisible, life would be much less complicated.
Mmm.
And much less interesting.
- That belongs on the lamp, sir.
- I know it.
It looks much better with a bulb in it.
- What's the gun for?
- It's a damp night, sir.
Do you always wear a shotgun to keep you dry?
Being damp out, it's foggy.
And being foggy, it's a good cover for the return attack of the thugs who took the machine.
I intend to patrol the grounds, sir, which at least makes sense.
We needed that hole for ventilation, sir.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
I'm so excited!
Sit still.
It will only take a minute. Here.
You forgot to say "ouch."
I'm so worried about what he'll think of me.
I think he'll think he likes you.
Yeah, but he's always liked glamour girls with expensive clothes and furs and things, and all I've got is this wrinkled old dress.
What you really need is a new outfit to make an entrance in.
Well, you needn't rub it in.
Wonderful thing, these shopping services, really.
Guaranteed glamorous or your money back.
Oh!
Open it!
Oh, Professor!
Oh!
Oh!
- Oh, Professor.
- Wait, wait. Save those for Richard.
- I charged it to his account.
- Well, I don't care. You're a darling.
Wait, control yourself!
Get dressed and knock him cold!
Oh, boy, will I?
Oh, isn't that lovely?
Just remember one thing, young woman.
No alcohol or liquor of any sort.
When you dissipate, you disappear.
- Hey, buddy.
- Huh?
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Have you got a match?
Uh, why yes, indeed, sir.
- Hold it, will you, bud?
- Why, certainly, sir.
Cert...
Hey, you frightened him.
Do something.
Oh! Look at my hair.
It's a mess.
Gosh, she's taking her time.
Professor, what does she look like?
Ooh, a girl, you know.
I never have paid much attention to women myself.
She ever say anything about me?
Well, not a word.
Oh, she didn't, huh?
Of course, it's a matter of complete indifference to me.
I'm through with women, anyway.
Well, here she comes.
No, stay right where you are.
I want to get a good look at you.
Kitty, this is wonderful.
This is even better than I expected.
- Dick!
- Stick 'em up.
- How dare you, huh?
- Frankie, get her off me!
Here, hold this.
Come on, lady.
Be a gentleman about this.
- Oh, stop!
- Come on.
Leave me alone, you hear?
Give me that. Come on.
Where are we going?
Well, you wouldn't trust a beautiful dame like that with a couple of lugs like us, would you?
- Perhaps you're right.
- Well, come on!
Before I resign, sir, permit me to state there are prowlers about and they've got my gun.
Oh, my!
Pleasant evening for a drive.
Mmm-hmm. We're not going for a drive.
We're being taken for a ride.
Oh.
Why don't you look where you're going?
Hey, what...
- George, did you have to throw the fish?
- It's Friday, sir.
Now before you say,
"Where am I?" you're right here in your own front hall, sir.
You're quite all right.
Good grief!
Kitty and the professor!
They got them!
If they did, well, good riddance,
I'll say, sir.
Uh, pardon me, please.
Whatever it is, we don't want any.
I want Mr. Russell.
- Mr. Richard Russell.
- He's out tuna hunting.
- Huh?
- Who is it?
I don't know, sir, but it sounds like Jenny Lind.
- Well, let him in.
- Come in.
I'm Mr. Russell.
I can tell you where they took the girl and the professor.
For the love of Pete, where?
Down at Blackie Cole's hideout in Mexico.
He's got the invention, too.
George, get the airport.
Call the airport, we're leaving.
Oh, airport!
- No, on the phone!
- Oh, excuse me.
You don't know what this means to me, Mr...
- What's your name?
- It used to be Foghorn.
- How much farther is it?
- About five miles.
I hope the professor hasn't shown them how to use the machine.
Well, as soon as he does,
Blackie will bump both of them off.
That is, unless the professor talks Blackie to death first.
So you see, the entire principle is a combination of chemical, biological, and dynamic influencing.
Cut out the stalling!
For an hour, you've been using big words.
Yes, Professor, for the love of Mike, cut out the stalling.
I wanna go home.
You'll both go home on a slab if this guy don't come through.
I want to be invisible.
I don't blame you.
It would be a decided improvement.
Now, Professor, you either play ball with us or we get rough with the lady.
Play ball?
I was never any good at games.
Oh, you know what I mean.
Come clean about how that machine works.
Make me invisible, or else...
I would very much rather "else."
I did not invent that machine to make killers like you invisible.
How do you know
I'm a killer?
You have all the earmarks, my friend.
The constricted cerebellum, the receding frontal bone, the Lombrosian earlobe.
- I got all that, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.
And you are also given to sudden and unexpected outbursts of weeping.
Well, what do you know?
You'd cry, too, if you was exiled like me.
Sometimes I think
I can hardly stand it any longer.
Hey, lady!
- That stuff will melt your bridgework.
- Uh...
Impossible.
I haven't any bridgework.
Isn't he silly, Professor?
I don't feel a thing.
The reagent must be still functioning.
There's a molecular antagonism, you know.
I don't get the scientific lingo,
- but alcohol used to be my business.
- Uh...
But that stuff is practically T.N.T.
Oh, in that case...
Lady, have a heart.
I've seen them drink hair tonic,
I've seen them drink vanilla, but never this!
Boss, look!
Look!
Attagirl!
Take this and that!
Here I am. If you move fast, you can still catch me in the dress.
Oh, faster than that.
Here I am.
No, no, no. Over here.
I don't know my own strength.
Strike one!
Look out, shorty, you're next.
Better put that down or you'll break it.
There. Now you look like a fish.
Blackie! Blackie! Blackie!
You big fish.
A little bit of this will put you right to sleep.
You're even dizzier than you look.
Strike two!
And now to black out Blackie.
What do you say, Blackie?
How about you and I going over this room with your fine-tooth comb?
That's the only way you'll ever find me.
How to have fun at parties.
Why be a wallflower?
You, too, can be invisible in six easy lessons.
Amaze your friends.
Amaze yourself.
Now, just follow me.
Come on, Blackie.
You may not be able to catch me, but you might catch on to the trick.
Over here.
Well, I've always wondered how this thing works.
My, but it's pretty, isn't it?
Come on, Blackie.
Come on, let's look at this closer.
This way. Here I am.
Now the whole secret is to touch the wire cylinder.
That must be quite a shock to you.
Strike three! You're out!
- How am I doing?
- Fine. Untie me.
Not yet, Professor.
There are more of them outside.
You're safer here.
Whee! Set them up in the other alley!
Miss Kitty!
Yes, Professor.
- Are you all right?
- Never felt better.
Look, I'm mistress of all I survey!
Good.
Something seems to be the matter with my feet.
- They're all tied up.
- Huh?
Oh. I never thought of that.
Hey, somebody's coming.
I think it's...
Yes, it's Dick!
He can't rescue me this easy, he can't.
If he wants me, let him fight for me.
Well, you take the back door and I'll take the front door.
- Yeah, and I'll be in Brooklyn before you.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Open up in there!
- We'll scare them out.
- Yeah, we'll scare them.
Those are the noisiest grasshoppers I ever heard.
Christopher Columbus!
We're being shot at!
Help! Help!
- It's Kitty. We've got to go to her.
- No, no, no.
Let's try and make her come to us.
Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.
Here, Kitty.
Here, Kitty.
Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.
Here, Kitty.
It serves you right.
That's what you get for putting me in that Turkish bath and turning me into a tenor.
You double-crossed me.
Sure, I double-crossed you.
You had it coming to you.
Uh...
Gee!
I got my pipes back.
Thanks, boss.
That's all right.
Let bygones be bygones.
Now my pipes are gone.
Help!
I don't know why I should be afraid.
Professor, where's Kitty?
No, no, not that!
Anything, but that!
- What was that?
- That was Kitty.
Help, help!
I'm drowning!
Where are you?
Right beside you.
We fell for each other in a big way after all, didn't we?
You're all wet, but I love you.
Well, he may have
Mrs. Russell's coloring, but he definitely resembles our side of the family, sir.
He has your eyes.
- Oh, yes, my eyes exactly.
- I'm not so sure about that.
Who do you think he looks like,
Professor?
A bit like me, don't you think?
Hereditary.
There's a curse upon this village... the curse of Frankenstein.
Aye.
Aye, it is true.
The whole countryside shuns the village.
Our fields are barren, the inn is empty.
My little ones cry in their sleep.
They are hungry. There is no bread.
It's the curse, the curse of Frankenstein.
This is nonsense, folks.
You talk as though these were the Dark Ages.
You know as well as I do... that the monster died in the sulphur pit under Frankenstein's tower... and that Ygor, his familiar... was riddled with bullets from the gun of Baron Frankenstein himself.
But Ygor does not die that easily.
They hanged him and broke his neck, but he lives.
Haven't I seen him, sitting beside the hardened sulphur pit... playing his weird horn, as if to lure the monster... back from death to do his evil bidding.
You talk like frightened children.
Well, if something isn't done... there'll be a new mayor after the fall election.
Aye!
- What do you want me to do?
- Destroy the castle.
Wipe the last traces of these accursed Frankensteins from our land.
- The people are right, Your Honour.
- I agree, Your Honour.
I don't believe that these dead wretches can affect the prosperity of this village.
But do as you will with the castle.
It's yours.
We'll blow it up!
Look! Old Ygor!
I told you he was alive.
All the more reason to blow up the castle.
Die, you fiend! You swine!
My friend!
They didn't kill you!
You lived through the pit, the sulphur pit!
Sulphur was good for you, wasn't it?
It preserved you.
We have to hurry. Hurry.
Come. I help you, my friend.
Come, my friend.
Now you live forever. They can't destroy you.
Come. We go away.
We have to hurry.
They dynamite the castle.
They're too late. We fooled them.
Come. We go to the country.
A better country than this.
No!
Come back!
No!
The lightning.
It is good for you.
Your father was Frankenstein.
But your mother was the lightning.
She has come down to you again.
We will go to Ludwig, the second son of Frankenstein.
He has all the secrets of his father, who created you.
We will force him to harness the lightning for you.
It will give you strength, strength of a hundred men.
Come.
We are going to find Dr. Frankenstein.
There you are, gentlemen.
The usual post-surgical treatment.
Think of it.
The first time the human brain has been removed from the skull... subjected to surgery, and then replaced.
With success, we hope.
After all, Dr. Frankenstein, we have to remember... the patient was violently dementia praecox.
Medical science has advanced a great deal... since you made your experiment, Dr. Bohmer.
It's unfortunate that it had such tragic consequences.
But you blazed the trail.
It was you who pointed the way.
If you should want me, gentlemen,
I shall be in my library completing my notes.
- How's the patient, Dr. Kettering?
- All indications excellent.
Respiration, pulse, everything.
- Wonderful, wasn't it?
- Yes.
Wonderful.
A bit belated, perhaps, but wonderful nevertheless.
Why live always in the past, Dr. Bohmer?
You've allowed that one mistake of yours to embitter your whole life.
Mistake? No.
Just a slight miscalculation, that's all.
But my experiment was a success.
In those days...
I was the master.
Frankenstein was just the pupil.
But I made a slight miscalculation.
Please, what is the name of this village?
- Vasaria.
- Pretty place.
Is there a doctor named Frankenstein...
Ludwig Frankenstein in the village?
You mean the one who heals those who are sick in mind?
Yes. That's the one I mean.
- Do you know the doctor?
- Very well.
I know his father and his brother, too.
He lives in a chateau at the end of the village.
- A large house with a high wall.
- Yes. Thank you.
I'll show her how to boot it.
Look at your ball up there.
- How do you like that?
- All the way up on the roof.
Hello.
Are you a giant?
Can you get my ball?
Way up there.
- Isn't that your child, Hussman?
- Yes!
No!
Don't do that. Do you want to kill my child?
Cloestine, ask your friend to bring you down, dear.
Ask your friend to bring you down.
Please take me down to Daddy.
Tell him no one will hurt him.
Take me down.
My daddy says no one will hurt you.
- Get him!
- No! You promised not to hurt him.
- Where are you going, Erik?
- Hello, Elsa. I didn't see you.
What are you doing driving around the countryside... in the middle of the day?
Town prosecutor should be in his office, working.
Sometimes my work takes me out of my office.
- I came to see your father.
- That's pretty.
I flattered myself that you came way out here to take me for a drive.
I wish that were the case, darling.
Nothing could make me happier.
But this is a very serious matter.
I must see your father.
Since you put it that way,
I'll have to find him.
Come in.
- Father, you have a visitor.
- And a very welcome one, too.
Delighted to see you, Erik. How are you?
You look worried.
Elsa been treating you badly?
No, not at all, sir.
Be patient. Wait till you're married.
Doctor, we have a madman in jail.
I'd like you to examine him and advise us.
Well, I have some work to do, but I'll come later.
But this is urgent.
He's already killed two villagers.
We have him chained but if he breaks loose, he can tear down the building.
- That's rather an exaggeration, isn't it?
- No, indeed, sir.
He's huge, a monster.
I've never seen anything like him.
Very well, Erik.
As soon as I finish my work, I'll come down.
Thank you, sir. I'll be expecting you.
Come.
There's a man in the waiting room to see you, Doctor. He says it's very urgent.
He comes from the village of Frankenstein.
Very well, I'll see him.
Martha...
I'd rather my daughter didn't know about this visitor.
Certainly, sir.
How does it feel to face a man you thought your brother killed, Doctor?
- What do you want?
- The monster is with me.
He's the one in the police station.
But he won't be there long.
You will bring him here.
- The law must take its course.
- Law! What can the law do to him?
Do you think they can keep him in jail?
He is more dangerous today than he ever was before.
Besides his sick brain, he has a sick body.
You can make him well, Frankenstein.
How? What can I do?
You can harness the lightning, as your father did.
Pour life into his hungry veins.
Give him back the strength he once had.
Will you do it, Frankenstein?
Ever since the day my father put life into that creature, it has been a curse.
The terrible consequences of his creation killed my father... and drove my brother into exile.
The monster shall not ruin my life.
I'm happy here.
I have a lovely daughter, friends.
They know nothing of all this.
You wouldn't like to spoil that, Doctor, would you?
You wouldn't want me to tell them... that you are the son of the Frankenstein that created him... that your brother made the thing live... after it had been dead for years.
Do you want me to tell them, Frankenstein?
No.
All right.
Then you'll make the police to hand him over to you.
Yes.
I could do that.
And you will do it, Frankenstein.
Very well.
Now get out!
Father, who was that strange man I saw leaving the house?
Nobody of any consequence, darling.
A patient.
He smiled at me.
A cruel smile.
It was dreadful.
Well, you know what my patients are.
Don't let it worry you.
Now come along, my dear.
I must be getting down to the village.
Order! Order, please!
I've read the report on the nameless prisoner.
I don't understand the urgency that requires an immediate hearing.
This is an unusual case, sir.
The prisoner's dangerous.
It'd be wise to remand him to the higher court... and transfer him to the city soon.
I understand the man is insane.
There's no doubt of it.
But that's for the higher court to determine.
We should make a report on the prisoner's mental condition.
Dr. Frankenstein will be here shortly to examine him.
Very well.
The prosecutor may proceed.
What is your name?
Where are you from?
Who brought you to Vasaria?
You see, Your Honour?
This mad beast cannot even talk.
I recommend that you order him remanded to the higher court without further delay.
I understand the little Hussman girl has a certain influence over the prisoner.
Perhaps if she talked to him, we might learn his identity.
Your Honour, I protest.
We've had one harrowing experience with this...
He did her no harm.
And some attempt must be made to establish his identity.
I can't allow my child to take this chance.
We don't know what he might do.
He was promised he'd not be harmed, and he's been beaten half to death.
What's your name?
Where do you live?
Won't you tell us?
All this can serve no purpose, Your Honour.
Dr. Frankenstein is here.
Let him examine the prisoner now.
He seems to recognise you, Dr. Frankenstein.
I never saw this man before in my life.
I know nothing about him.
Come.
Quickly.
Get in here.
Father!
- The monster, it's here. I've seen it.
- Nonsense.
He was standing outside the window, staring at...
Your nerves are on edge. It's the storm.
No, it's here, I tell you.
That other creature was with him. That Ygor.
Frankenstein!
No!
No. Come away.
Come away with me.
Nobody will know who did it.
Come. Come with me.
- Father, who is it?
- Dr. Kettering.
Elsa, go back!
Come away.
Come with me. Come.
Bohmer? Dr. Bohmer!
- What is it, Doctor?
- Give me a hand.
Father.
The monster?
Don't be afraid, darling.
You're quite safe now.
He's powerless for the time being.
Forgive me, Elsa, but I had to expose you to the soporific gas... in order to subdue the others.
You do understand, don't you, dear?
Yes, but I'm afraid.
Send for Erik and the police.
The police can do nothing.
They put him in jail yesterday, but he escaped.
And Dr. Kettering?
I tried to save him, but it was impossible.
He's dead.
- Murdered?
- Yes.
Ever since I can remember,
I have dreaded this moment.
For years I felt secure, certain that the monster had been destroyed.
I tried to keep all knowledge of it from you.
And until last night, I succeeded.
I had to know.
Yesterday, when I saw Ygor...
I felt that something had come out of the past to threaten our happiness.
Please don't let it spoil our lives.
- Father, promise me.
- I promise you, Elsa.
I'll find a way.
I must find a way.
Dr. Bohmer, I need your aid.
This monster must be destroyed.
Destroyed? But how?
He's not subject to the ordinary laws of life.
There is a way.
He was made limb by limb, organ by organ.
He must be unmade in the same way.
Dissection?
Bit by bit, piece by piece... just as my father created it.
But this thing lives. It would be murder.
How can you call the removal of a thing that is not human murder?
I regret, Doctor...
I cannot be part of your plan.
Then I must do it alone.
While it lives, no one is safe.
My son.
What are you about to do?
Would you destroy... that which I, your father, dedicated his life to creating?
I must.
The monster you created is in itself destruction.
Nevertheless, I was near to solving a problem... that has baffled man since the beginning of time... the secret of life, artificially created.
But it has brought death to everything that it's touched.
That is because, unknowingly...
I gave it a criminal brain.
With your knowledge of science, you can cure that.
It's beyond my cure.
It's a malignant brain.
What if it had another brain?
Another brain!
Bohmer! Dr. Bohmer!
What is it, Doctor? You've changed your mind?
Yes. Attach the high-frequency leads to the terminal electrodes.
- Yes, sir.
- Frankenstein!
Come in, Ygor. I may need your assistance.
You have agreed.
You are going to help him, Doctor?
You are giving him life.
Yes, but not for the purpose that you think, Ygor.
I'm giving him strength so that an operation may be successful.
An operation?
Yes, I'm giving him another brain.
You must explain to him when he becomes conscious.
You must make him understand.
Whose brain?
- Kettering?
- Yes, Kettering.
A man of character and learning.
The monster will cease to be an evil influence... and become everything that is good.
No!
You cannot take my friend away from me.
He's all that I have, nothing else.
You're going to make him your friend, and I will be alone.
It will be as I say, or he must be destroyed.
He cannot be destroyed.
There is one way.
- By dissection.
- No.
Not that. Doctor.
Ygor's body's no good.
His neck is broken, crippled and distorted... lame and sick from the bullets your brother fired into me.
You can put my brain in his body.
Your brain?
You can make us one.
We'll be together always... my brain and his body... together.
You're a cunning fellow, Ygor.
Do you think that I'd put your sly and sinister brain into the body of a giant?
That would be a monster indeed.
You'll do as I tell you, or I'll not be responsible for the consequences.
Ironic, isn't it, Doctor?
Yes, the monster's victim shall inherit his body.
And everlasting life.
Build up the voltage potential to its maximum.
It all seems so weird and ghastly.
- I can't stand it any longer, I tell you...
- Elsa.
And you, Father, something's happened to you.
It seems as if a great cloud has come over you.
You don't seem like my father at all.
You must trust me, my dear.
You must realise my problem.
One thing I can assure you.
The monster will never trouble anyone again.
Good morning.
I was wondering, Doctor, when you plan to operate.
At once.
Tonight, if possible.
- I should like to see the patient immediately.
- Yes, Doctor.
A new brain. You understand?
A new brain. New brain!
- Does he understand?
- Yes.
- Is he willing?
- Can't you see?
He is the first time happy in his life.
Good. Take good care of him today.
I shall operate tonight.
All right.
No. Not now. Tonight.
So you're going to let Frankenstein do this operation... to put the brain of his friend into our friend.
- Our friend?
- Yeah.
You, the great Dr. Bohmer... who taught Frankenstein everything he knows.
How would you like to be the leader of your profession in this state?
The head of the medical commission?
The regent of the university?
You weave a pretty fairy tale, crooked neck.
How could that be accomplished?
You will see to it... that the brain of Kettering does not go into the head of the monster.
But why?
My brain will go into it.
- You fool, you'd die.
- Die! I will live again.
Only this crooked body will die.
I will live forever.
My brain in that body would make me a leader of men.
We would rule the state... and even the whole country.
You'll do as I say... and you will have everything you want.
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Erik.
- Good evening.
We're awfully sorry to disturb you.
We've called regarding the escaped maniac.
- Well?
- The countryside's been combed.
Every barn and haystack's been searched... and the neighbouring villages have been notified.
But he and his companion have disappeared completely.
It seems that you've done all that is possible.
A creature like that couldn't pass long unnoticed.
Obviously someone's offering him refuge.
What are you trying to insinuate, Erik?
Perhaps you would care to search the estate.
I warn you, if you contemplate such presumption... you will not be welcome here in the future as my guest.
That won't be necessary.
If you'll permit me to have a few words with Dr. Kettering...
Unfortunately, Dr. Kettering has had to leave suddenly... owing to illness in his family.
He was here yesterday evening. I saw him.
Quite so. He left early this morning.
You were at the station to watch the morning train?
Dr. Kettering was not on the morning train.
I'll have to risk your displeasure, Doctor.
We will search the premises.
Very well.
This is my laboratory, gentlemen.
Inspect the walls and flooring for secret passageways.
Very good.
Mr. Ernst.
Will you guide us, Doctor?
I believe that leads to an old dungeon.
Why, certainly.
What's that room, Doctor?
An auxiliary operating room, maintained at a very low temperature.
It's not in use now.
Will you lead us, Doctor?
It would seem that this room has been recently occupied, Doctor.
You're familiar with my work.
I keep this room ready at all times for the more violently insane.
- You can see that it is not occupied now.
- Yes.
My apologies, Doctor.
I warned you that you might regret this action.
Are you mad? Why did you let him get away?
Let him? You think I had any idea what he was going to do?
Or that I could stop him?
The police have searched the place for him.
Then it's good that we were gone.
Frankenstein's been half insane.
He wants to operate tonight.
- The child complicates matters.
- Leave that to me.
He will have to be told.
Ygor will explain to him.
No, you do not understand.
It will kill her. You wouldn't want to kill your little friend.
But Ygor has a better idea. You will see.
You will have the brain of your friend Ygor.
Tonight, my brain... will be your brain.
Tonight, Ygor will die for you.
Help!
Elsa.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out to find Erik.
- In this storm?
- Yes, Father. I can't...
Father, what does he want?
I'm going to operate to give him a new brain.
He wants the brain of that child.
Take me home. Please, take me home.
Father. Surely you're not going to...
Take the child in there, quickly.
How did the patient react to the anaesthetic?
Surprisingly well, particularly the spinal.
I think I can safely say everything is ready.
Dr. Bohmer, our respective operations must be timed with the utmost precision.
Any delay in the transfer will mean failure.
Exactly, sir.
- Shall I proceed?
- Yes.
I must warn you... this operation may not be successful.
This may be the end of everything.
Better death... than a life like this... now that I have seen... the promise of a life forever.
Kettering's brain.
What will he think when he resumes life in that body?
Will he thank us for giving him a new lease on life?
Or will he object to finding his ego living in that human junk heap?
There's no sign of returning consciousness yet, Doctor.
I anticipated this.
Let me know immediately if there's a change in his condition.
Certainly, sir.
Dr. Bohmer, I can never thank you sufficiently... for your assistance and skill.
This may bring you the recognition which has long been due to you.
That's very nice of you, sir.
None of us will be safe.
Who's he going to get next?
Fellow townsmen, it's two weeks since my little daughter disappeared.
It's the common belief that she perished when my house was burned down.
But a search was made of the ashes... and no bones were found.
She was stolen, stolen by the fiend who murdered Carl and Josef.
We've searched the hills, the mountains and the forests, and he can't be found.
Why can't he be found?
Why can't the police find him?
There's a very good reason. He's being harboured, protected by someone.
There's only one person that would protect a maniac like that.
- Who?
- Dr. Frankenstein.
Let's go to Frankenstein and choke the truth out of him.
Mr. Ernst!
They're on their way to Dr. Frankenstein!
Stop! Stop right where you are!
When did you decide to take the law into your own hands?
When we found out we couldn't get any help from you.
Two men have been murdered, and we want that maniac.
My little child has been stolen.
The law in Vasaria has done everything in its power to apprehend this monster.
Maybe Dr. Frankenstein can tell us where he is.
Nothing's to be gained by hasty action.
Nothing's to be gained by waiting either... when the prosecutor's in love with Frankenstein's daughter.
That has nothing to do with my duty.
Let me have a few moments alone with Dr. Frankenstein.
If he's concealing this monster, he must be made to give him up.
If he refuses, you can take any action you want to.
Does that sound fair to you, men?
I'd like to see Dr. Frankenstein.
He isn't seeing anyone.
- He'll have to see me.
- Erik.
What are those people doing at the gates?
They're demanding to see your father.
Why? What do they want with him?
They think he knows something about the monster's disappearance.
What can we do?
I've got to see him before they do, or
I can't be responsible for the consequences.
- What is it you want?
- The villagers are getting out of hand.
If you expect the protection of my office, you'll have to be frank.
There are certain matters which must be clarified.
- What do you mean?
- The case of Dr. Kettering.
He did not return home.
He wasn't even expected there.
He did not leave Vasaria by train, as you intimated.
Your servants say his clothes are still in his room... which is locked by your orders.
I think the time's come for a showdown, Doctor.
Perhaps you're right, Erik. Come with me.
- May I have a word with you?
- Yes, sir.
It is imperative that we see the patient.
What is his condition?
His recuperative powers have proved tremendous.
He appears to have complete control of all his faculties.
Why did you deny that you were concealing the monster, Doctor?
It was necessary for a while.
You see, Erik, the monster, as you know, was a homicidal maniac.
He killed Dr. Kettering, but Dr. Kettering lives again.
His brain is now inside the skull of the monster.
I have replaced an evil brain with a good one.
I have made amends for the great tragedy... that my father and brother unintentionally brought to this community.
I've restored the good name of Frankenstein.
Let me show you.
He's been in there long enough.
We may be losing valuable time.
All right, men, he's had his chance.
Now it's our turn.
Come on!
Do you recognise me?
Tell me... who am I?
You are Dr. Frankenstein.
And you are?
You are Dr. Kettering.
I am not Dr. Kettering.
I am Ygor.
What have I done?
I am Ygor.
I have the strength of a hundred men.
I cannot die. I cannot be destroyed!
I, Ygor, will live forever!
I've created a hundred times the monster that my father made.
Bohmer! This is your work!
Don't touch him, Frankenstein.
He's my friend.
I should kill you, Frankenstein.
But after all... your father gave me life... and you gave me a brain.
It's the townspeople.
I can't offer you protection now.
Bohmer, turn on the gas.
Fill the house with it.
We'll kill all of them.
Get back! You may all be killed!
They're turning on the gas!
Bohmer! You must be mad!
Leave him alone.
My dear!
I told you it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Find him!
- Get out of the house! Hurry!
- But what about Father?
I'll go back for him.
Bohmer.
I can't see.
- Bohmer! Where are you?
- Here I am.
I can't see you.
Your dream of power is over, Bohmer.
You didn't realise... his blood is the same type as Kettering's... but not the same as Ygor's.
It will not feed the sensory nerves.
Bohmer. You played me a trick.
What good is a brain without eyes to see?
What good is a brain without eyes?

Landing on the dock!
- Back! Back!
- Come on!
Fred! Fred!
I am here.
Two whole years.
I seems more like 200.
Look, honey, this crap is wide style.
I meet you at the end.
OK.
- That's better.
- Oh Jee is good having you back.
- Was the trip a success?
- A successful? Look.
20 tigers, 20 lions, 6 zebras
11 leopards and Cheela.
Cheela?
The most gorgeous lady that ever came out of the jungle.
A gorgeous lady?
Wait till meet her.
Come on, let me introduce you.
Hi, Cheela.
Cheela, listen, I want you to meet Beth, my sweetheart.
How do you do, Cheela.
You See? That's what I like about Cheela.
No jealousy.
Careful down there!
Hold it!
Stay here.
Young man, you are marvelous.
Where did you learn to do that?
Don't scare me like this again.
I could not bear.
- Nice work boss.
- Who tied that cage?
I do not know.
One of the loaders.
Pretty crap job. Go get an empty.
I have to cage this cat.
Wait for me in the baggage handling, honey.
The rest of you people better go for covering.
Everything was running fine.
Was all excited about your coming home...
And then this thing happened to Dorothy.
How serious is it?
Some sort of a glandular trouble.
Why didn't you write me about it?
Why worry you.
I left her at the Crestview
Sanatorium about two weeks ago.
 We've been with several doctors 
<I> and all recommended take it to this Dr. Walters 
<I> It really was an ordeal 
<I> Poor little Dorathy was as nervous as could be. 
 My mind was seted easy about having brought her to the right place 
 when, I picked up one of the medical books and I read some of his achivements. 
Medicine and Surgery.
 "Glands and their secretions 
" by Dr. Sigmund Walters.
"Dr. Sigmund Walters, of Crestview Sanatorium,
" He made not one but three attempts of racial improvment."
"He discovered vitamin E-2, which he belive, determines the physical characteristics of all forms of animal life..."
"The 48 chromosomes which shape heredity and the numerous hormones."
 I realized she wasn't
 listening to thing 
<I> I set down and tried to comfort her, but it was no use 
<I> The storm outside wasn't helping us either. 
 Coming through the book 
  I ran across to some of the 
 most fantastic achievements of this Dr. Walters 
 Such as a hand, three times as hard as should be 
 reduced to normal.
 A complete deformed child corrected by his glandular treatments 
 Described in words
I didn't understand
 how he changed a man's distorted feature. 
ACROMEGALIC FORM.
"The Acromegalic Form"
" Due to a hypersecretion
 in the anterior portion front..."
" of the pituitary glande".
- Dr. Walters will receive you now.
- Thank you.
I'm Dr. Walters.
Want to sit down?
- You Smoke?
- No, thanks.
I smoke that is, but I don't care for now.
I see.
- Which one is Dorothy?
- I am.
- You're her sister.
- Yes
You are both connected to the Whipple circus?
That's right.
Well what seems to be the trouble?
Well, I...
Dorothy has been losing weight all season.
We thought maybe it was overwork and...
Please Continue.
The reason much us to tell.
At the close of the season, a few days ago, she suddenly collapsed.
The doctor thought it was a glandular disorder, and recommended to we bring her to you.
Most ills are traceable to the glandular problems.
Could you prepare Miss. Colman to examination, please?
Sit down, please.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thank you.
You both perform in the circus?
No, my sister is.
I'm Mr. Whipple's secretary.
I see. In a way we have something in common.
In your business you use animals for entertainment purposes.
I in the other hand, use them for scientific experiments.
So, I read medical journals.
You've accomplished great things.
Oh, I've hardly scratched the surface.
There's so much more to be done.
One fears a single lifetime is far too short.
The patient is ready, doctor.
- You excuse me?
It won't be long...
 After our true talking, I realized we were lucky to get him, 
 because he really  was a very famous scientist  besides being one of the most charming man I've ever met.
Oh, so that's how it is.
Is he young?
So so.
Good looking? Of course, oh sure!
Tell me more about it.
Well, he is... taking me out to dinner a few times.
Well, maybe I better have a look on this guy, pretty quick.
Oh, you will.
Maybe at the winter quarters when we get there.
I invited him.
WINTER QUARTERS.
JOHN WHIPPLE'S CIRCUS
Nothing has changed a bit.
I'll be with in a minute, honey.
I'm gonna surprising you.
OK.
- It can't be that tough, John.
- Well is pretty dif...
Fred! Well, you old tiger bait.
How are you?
- Well, I'm not in a wheelchair yet.
- How was the trip?
Fine. Got everything I wanted.
- Everything.
- Oh, that's great!
I've heard you had a little troble on the dock.
Oh, Yes. One of the cats got loose.
No body was hurt.
Say look! When we gonna know for about the Beatty?
Well, haven't signed yet, but...
Do you think it was wise, to take all this new bunch of cats... without having Beatty signing the stage there for you?
Now, is gonna be all right, Fred.
Is gonna Be Alright.
Oh, Dr. Walters.
I'm so glad to see you.
- I took at your word, you see?
- How is Dorothy?
She is showing exciting improvement...
But I still have to keep her on observation  for a quite some time.
I don't know how to thank you for your interest in the case.
Mean you tell me that you got the both of them?
- Yes
- It's wonderful.
Mr. Whipple, this is Dr. Walters.
- Hello, doctor.
Beth just told me good deal about you.
And Mr. Mason, Fred Mason.
Miss. Colman told me a good deal about you.
- Is talking a little so, isn't she?
- Yes, but efficient.
You know, I always wanted to get behind the scenes in circus.
So I accepted Miss
Colman's invitation.
Good! Just in time we're going out look over the stable.
- Would you like to join us?
- I'll be delighted!
Oh fine. Come on with us.
He brought back some wonderful things.
I think we can...
If that wire comes on Beatty, let me know.
You better go.
Come on.
Let's get a closer look.
What do you think?
Pretty vicious looking.
Yeah, we will have them toned down before long.
That should be a interesting process.
I like to watch it some time.
- You are welcome at any time, doctor.
- Thank you.
Here come the lions.
Say, look at that baby.
Is Nero.
It's a killer.
He got four natives in the jungle and mangle a handler aboard the ship.
Maybe we ought get rid of him.
One of the zoos would buy him.
Oh, no, you don't. It's for me.
I'll get him in a tame.
- Any problem, Tony?
- No, they handle like babies.
- What do you think?
- Well, it's a fine health lot.
- Fred!
- Oh, Curley.
- Wow, it's good to see you, Fred.
- Finally, is good to be back.
- Did all right, ah?
- Yes
- How many?
- Forty.
- Forty. Forty?
- Yes
I will feed them, but...
You gonna explain meat last Tuesday, though.
Must have a lot of money invested  in this cats.
Well, is not the cost is the appeal.
Oh, you'll enjoy this.
Well, I can imagine what's gonna happen when they put Tigers in with them.
Is the intention to mix lions with tigers together?
Yes, sir, that's the idea a mixed act.
Get back.
Help!
Cheela! Cheela!
Let go! Let go!
Get back there.
No, John.
No no. Here.
You should no about mistreat animals.
I was just just bringing our fellow water.
Are you been warned about not to drinking on the job.
You're fired! Get out of here!
Come on! Get out!
Well, this is a surprise.
Why did not you tell me about this?
Oh, she is terrific.
She is almost human.
She is the center respect to the act, John.
Look, I want to show you something.
Come, come Cheela, here.
Turn around, turn around.
She seems to have far above the average intelligence.
She has a natural talent.
I want to show you something else.
Turn around, Cheela.
Cheela, I want you meet my boss, Mr. Whipple.
And, Dr. Walters, a friend.
When did you get time for all this?
On the boat coming over.
Jonh, she isa natural.
I think I can do wonders with her.
I want take charge of her personally.
Training, feeding, and everything.
Before you got the job.
Do you have many inquiries about selling this animals?
Yes, sometimes.
If you take an animal like this, suppose someone will buy it.
Oh, well if this animal works for the circus, and looks like she will... all the money in town couldn't buy her.
He's dead.
I've come to this conclusion,
Ms. Strand,
The type of species which we made experiments are not satisfactory.
Size, strength, the will to live, the essentials that we are trying to accomplish... like in these animals.
We have the elements which could make possible the we try to do.
I don't understand.
It's been proven with no doubt...
The glands can transform phisical mater to any size, shape or appearance.
Yes, that's true.
We have here in this sanatorium a rare case of follicular cyst... which induce the secretion of an inusual amount of sexual hormones.
- Miss. Colman?
- Yes
If we been able to create, through the median glandular extraction of specimens that have.
What's to prevent us transfusing these glandular extractions... from a human being into a higher type of animal?
The Authorities.
They won't permit it.
I see you're not trully a scientist,
Miss. Harper Strand.
The thing we are trying to do we must be getting.
- I'll be out this afternoon.
- Yes, doctor.
Photograph that.
20 years in the show business and now I get the ball on rush.
And all because of a stinky over grown monkey.
How do I like that...
This is why I'm here.
How would you like to get back that ape,
 and Whipple?
Hey, get out!
Can't you see we're talking business?
Yeah...
What it's all about, Mister?
I would like to get that ape.
You think you could steal it from there?
Steal it?
Just like that!
So easy?
Sure!
How much?
I will not give out the price if is reasonable.
When do I get paid?
Just as soon as the animal is on my truck.
It's a deal, Mister.
You got yourself a monkey.
How about us having a little drink, hein?
A little drink to a monkey business.
Waiter.
Hey! Doc! Doc!
Well, the ape is in the truck.
Well, how about my money?
What did you do? No!
Help me, doc! Doc! Wait!
I won't say... doc!
CIRCUS HANDLER MURDERED BY APE!
MAN KILLED BY STRANGULATION
NAILS OF BEAST PRESS THROUGH
BACK OF NECK SERVERING SPINAL CORD
Yes, I understand.
You can depend on me chief, absolutely.
I give you my word of honor.
All right, all right chief.
We got to find that animal.
They are holding me responsible.
She's bound to turn up.
She can't stay out of site forever.
If she attacks anybody else, we are out of business, you know that.
Well, we will find out.
Do not worry about it.
Oh, you don't worry about it?
Cheela, we are in the road to great things.
You're the answer of years of planning.
Fred.
Oh, hello Beth.
Where you been?
At the sanatorium.
Dorothy was operated on.
Operated on?
Why Dr. Walters said treatment would do the trick.
Apparently it didn't.
- Fred, I'm so worried about her.
- She'll be all right.
You can't expect them to do miracles.
Those things just take time.
- We are ready for you, boss!
- All right!
I don't will get you down.
Come on, give me a smile.
That's better.
Well, I take it out.
Keep your chin up, beautiful.
My God!
Don't go get in panic.
That's the first thing you got to learn on animal training.
But you're not in love with him.
Another gun! Quick!
See? Just like I said.
Nothing happened.
We've did it!
We've did it!
- Dr. Walters, we can't go on with that.
- Why not?
In the past i've been willing to helping you in experiments with animals...
But this is different.
I can't have my hands staining with human blood.
Look at that girl.
Slowly but surely, you're taking the life out of her.
It's Murder, Doctor.
You can't do it!
Why shoud a single life be considering too important?
Look Dr. Walters,
For 13 years I worked with you,
Shared your experiments,
Watch you gain the highest honors in the field of endocrinology.
I see you gain control of the physical characteristics of men... and change the breed and sex of animals.
I've listen your dreams of create a race of supermen.
Isn't that a lot of intent?
But while been doing you lost sight for something else.
- And that is?
- Yourself.
I saw you at  start watched you grow,
Watched your brain that once was fine and brilliant begin to get weak... and playing with things that no man or woman should ever touch.
Now maybe you listen to me.
Haven't I proved beyond any doubt the glands can transform phisical matter to any size, shape or appearance?
Yes, you have.
But ain't doing this...
When you took the glands from the guinea pig and graft into the rabbit, the guinea pig died.
When you grafted the frog's glands into a white mouse, the frog died.
And now you propose to experiment with an ape and a woman.
That woman will eventually die.
Then she will die in the advance of science.
And suppose your experiment is successful, what will you have?
A human form with animal instincts.
I won't let you do!
I'm going to the police!
You must stop!
You're right, Miss Strand.
My new creation needs the element of mental stability that can not come from a human brain.
Miss. Colman is essential to me for continue glandular injections.
Transplanting of cerebrum is certain death to her.
I can't afford that.
But you are a woman with a very receptive mind.
- No
- You're right.
The cerebrum is essential for the success of this experiment.
No! Don't do it!
Stop!
The sacrifice of Miss. Strand for the cerebrum operation proved worthwhile - Dorothy
Colman's condition improving -
She will continue to be useful to me -
 I saw it began and watched grew, 
 Watched your brain that once was fine and brilliant begin to get weak... 
 and playing with things that no man or woman should ever touch.
You are Paula Dupree.
Do you remember what happened?
Do you remember anything from your past life?
Your mind is my mind.
Your every thought is my thought.
What I tell you to do, you will do.
What I tell you not to do, you will not do.
Do you understand that, Paula Dupree?
 What do you have?
A human form with animal instincts. 
The mentality of Cheela, now Paula Dupree, is improving - it will be interesting to see how she reacts to her old environment, particularly Fred Mason -
I have 20 tigers, 20 lions and no
Beatty.
My idea is close the show.
- I would't say that.
- What you talking about?
He is the only man in the world can handle a show that with that many animals in it.
I'd like to take a crack at.
Oh, no, wait, Fred.
Captive and training one at the time that's one thing.
But to go into a cage with mixed animals and put in a show... that's quite another.
Only you can't just give up now.
You're in this too deep.
Now Fred, I know you're one of the best animal man in the business.
All right,  why don't you let me try?
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll start with one lion and one tiger and if I can not handle them,
I'll say no more about it.
No, I can't do it, Fred, it's too...
Hein?
So we are on?
If you got nerve enough to try it, go ahead.
That's a deal.
That's a deal.
What did he say?
Honey, I sold him my idea.
I'm putting on the animal act.
You'll what?
- Yes
Fred, you can't.
I won't let you.
Oh, honey, don't start to talking that way.
This is one big break of my life.
This is because I love you so damn much.
Oh Fred, I'm so afraid for you.
As long as you are out there waiting for me we  got nothing
 to be afraid of.
Could you retype...?
When you have time, do not hurry.
Slowly.
Ok, let him in.
You know what is the matter with them?
I do not know.
They seem to be afraid of something.
- Hello, doctor. Good to see you again.
- Mr. Whipple. Miss. Colman.
- Doctor.
- This is Miss Dupree a patient of mine.
- How do you do?
I hope you don't mind
I dropping in like this.
Oh, not at all. As a matter of fact you're just in time.
Fred is trying on a lion and a tiger together.
It's the first time?
As a matter of fact it is, we are all a little on edge.
OK, Bill, let in the tiger.
Caution, the lion!
Hal! Curley!
Do something, quick, someone!
Joe, Hal, bring your posts!
What you gonna do?
Oh you were marvelous Miss.
I do not know how to thank you.
- Fred, anybody hurt?
- No, I'm all right.
Stewart!
Go and get that hose!
Get the hose!
After all these years in the show business
I ain't seen anything like that girl.
She had that lion terrored to death.
Miss, never saw anybody do that before in my life.
No gun, no weapon, nothing.
I saw that cat back away from her.
You know we can use a girl like her around here.
What do you say, Miss?
First we better to do is take care of that head of yours, Mason.
Won't be a better idea.
Come on.
I do thank...
He talked to me and I let him...
This whole thing is unatural.
You should...
You'll never have an opportunity like this again.
I tell you, that girl's power with animals is uncanny.
You saw for yourself what she can do yesterday.
Yes, I saw.
Also I heard you lying in that cage.
It was only by the hand of fate that girl have no long.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
With her as extra assistent handler.
Oh, a cage full of animals with a girl mix up.
Doesn't make sense, Fred.
I don't intend to have a mix up act.
All I need is a handler stending outside in case of trouble.
No, I can't see it.
I don't think you can do it, Fred.
If you stop now, don't solve anything and certainly won't get you anyplace.
I'd rather not owner the circus if the success depend on the lives of the performers.
Oh well, now you are talking if those animals ran a hand and that was whats happen at all.
Was simple bad lock, that I was there, when the pedestal came down.
I tell you aren't a circus man, unless you let me have talk with that girl.
What I tell you is I won't do it!
All right.
Look John,
You know yourself there is nobody in this business I'd rather work for then you, but my mind is maid up!
I'm going after that girl, she and I are going to work lions and tigers together.
Now, If you are not giving us a chance,
I gonna find somebody who will.
Now, wait. Wait  a moment, please.
I am only thinking...
You... you make me feel as if signing your death warranty.
But if you insist on, go ahead and do it.
Thanks, John.
You don't want to get a hunch that with helping that girl, you and I will make
Circus history.
I hope it's not over your dead body, you stubborn...
Good luck.
A newcomer, Paula Dupree, has bounced out of nowhere and right into the Mason animal act in the Jonh Whipple Circus.
At press time, it was not understood just her part in it would be, but is safe to say she will be a decided asset to the act.
So, It's the big day, huh?
Well, it's the last rehearsal before we setup the attendents for the show.
- Music and everything.
- Where you'll open?
Right here in this town.
I'd like to give the local audience news as a break.
- Fred, how do you fill, hein?
- Oh, fine!
Do you think this all will be a success?
What do you thing?
With Paula here I can miss.
You ready, honey?
All right, Jim, start it!
Do not take your eyes of these cats.
OK, send them away.
I hope nothing happens.
I forgot to feed them.
Doesn't Paula go into the arena with him at all?
Oh no. No because when Paula and Fred are together in the cage together.
The cats seem so afraid of her... that they get confused.
They do not know whom to take orders.
Then she has power of control outside the cage?
That's the uncanny part of she does.
When she's there...
Fred can control those lions and tigers, without any trouble.
- Amazing, isn't?
- Amazing.
That girl can become one of the greatests animal trainers in the world.
Look at that.
- Let Nero in!
- Nero!
- He didn't tell me was gonna using him.
- Well, it's too late to stop him now.
Holy jump man!
Oh, he did it.
Fred, you did it!
Well you certainly did it, sun.
I'm convinced!
- How did you do it?
- Oh, that was super hot.
Honey, I want you live that easy to trade after we get married.
- Congratulations! You were excellent!
- Thank you, sir.
Overcame obstacles.
It's only a question of how long you want to keep the show going.
Thanks.
Well, it's a call for a celebration.
Will you joining us, Dr. Walters?
I'm sorry.
I've been away from the sanatory to long as it is.
It's a shame. Come on.
It's just... 20 years old if you rebuild...
Just a minute...
- What on those marks on her neck?
- That's what battles me.
Is a very powerful pair of hands who did this job.
Those deep claw like incisions in the back of the throat don't seen were made by human hands.
They've cut the spinal cord.
Tell me, young lady, what else you know about this thing?
I told you what I know.
So dark. I couldn't see very much.
Some sort of weird looking creature that came at me.
All right, Miss, you better find another room and get some sleep.
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- That's all folks. Go to your rooms.
Everything I planned complete destroyed.
All because your madness.
Your insane attempt to kill
Beth Colman.
You know what the police will do if they get you?
No, of course you don't.
They wouldn't know who's the jungle instinct that urged to kill
a female that stood between you and a mate?
They'll put you on trial... to you question up, to question at you... to don't know anybody is saying.
Then put you in a electric chair... and they kill you.
All because they won't understand.
They can't understand.
The one thing I hadn't counted on...
A terrific emotion will destroy the new tissues near gland growth.
I have myself part to blame.
I should've kepted you in a constant observation.
That's why I've looked at them.
I operated on you.
Grafted glands from a living woman in your body, watched you to transform...
Now I have to do it, all over again.
Graft new glands in your body.
Maybe another brain operation.
Taking another life to keep you on human form.
Well, Are you sure that is all the information you can give me?
It is important that the find her.
We open tonight.
Thank you, Dr. Walters.
I'm sorry to troubled you.
He can't tell us then anything.
He only knows her as patient.
Last time he saw her was at the rehearsal.
May I have one?
Fred.
You know?
There was something familiar about the face of that woman...
Whatever it was,
I saw that in my room that night.
What do you think it was?
It may sound fantastic, but
I think was Paula.
- Paula? It's ridiculous!
- I'm not so sure.
All seems to tie, and...
They said that woman was killed by claw like grip.
Gruen was killed the same way.
And all applies to Cheela, and...
I'm certain I saw
Paula's face that night.
- It was a... face of a...
- Wait a minut.
You're not trying to connect with Paula
Cheela, are you?
You said time and again Paula had a way with animals and it was unnatural...
Oh, look honey, you're letting your imagination run away with you.
Take it easy.
Well, I get to roll over.
I've get ready for the show tonight.
You mean you're going through without Paula?
Off course. I can't stop now, even if I want to.
But you said you couldn't control those cats without her standing by.
Stop worrying, will you?
I see you tonight.
CIRCUS JOHN WHIPPLE
Hey! Fred!
Fred, Listen, I...
What is the matter with you?
You look worried.
Well I am.
Is the weather report.
It's a good chance of storm going in here.
- Oh, we had storms before.
- Not this, indeed.
But that mixed animals act of yours is dangerous enough as it is.
If there is a flash or lightning, crash of thunder... that's no telling what might happen.
You worry too much.
You live this act with me.
Well, now you be careful!
Hello?
Oh, hello, Dorothy.
I was just on my way of the show.
It opens tonight.
You what?
You got to take me away from here.
I'm scared.
He is preparing me for another those operations.
Treatments, he calls them.
Darling, I'm surprised to hear you talk that.
You are getting the best care in the world.
I'm afraid, I tell you.
I won't stay here another minute.
Something terrible is going on.
I know it.
I can fill it!
Beth!
Dorothy!
Dorothy answer me.
Ladies and gentlemen!
You are now about to witness one of the most spectacular acts ever performed in any circus.
The most deadly enemies of the jungle, lions and tigers, mixed together in the same arena!
These feroses beasts... which until a few months ago, were roaming through the jungles...
Are now brought together, for the first time, by a man... who will make them do his every bit!
And now...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fred Mason!
Dr. Walters?
Dr Walt...
Well, Miss Colman.
Where is my sister?
I just come from her room and is not up there.
Calm down,
Calm yourself, Miss. Colman.
Never mind. Where is she?
I see her right the way.
By all means.
It is your privilege.
Please Follow me.
So you see Miss. Colman, you are about to witness something what no more eyes but mine has ever seen.
The transformation of an animal into a human being.
You can't do this.
I won't let you!
We're alone down here.
No one can stop me, not even you.
You're mad.
I won't let you do that.
I'll call the police.
Miss. Colman,
I'm a inherent believer in the association of thoughts.
Someone else once said the same thing to me.
Someone with a very clever mind.
Like yours.
And now you'll gonna watch this operation, and gonna be helpful to me.
Oh, Mr. Whipple, the storm is beginning to rain.
Get men along to the exits.
Keep thing rolling as usual.
Yes, sir.
We underestimated the animal intelligence.
 She scents what is comming.
She would love to get her hands on me.
Let Nero in!
Why?
I told him to keep Nero out.
I did too, Mr. Whipple, but he said the publicity was out with Nero on it.
Public knew it was a killer and that's why they came here to see him.
Damn...
Don't  stand, go and...
Ladies and gentlemen, please...
Fred, you can't go back in there.
Go get the ambulance. Quickly.
Cheela!
Don't shoot!
Get the vet!
Hurry up! Get the veterinary!
Fred, are you all right, son?
Yes, I'm all right.
There are deep slashes.
We get some help comming on the way now.
What happened?
Cheela, she came back.
She got me out of tha cage, just when one of the cats had me.
All right, all right you men, go and get the work.
Check those cages and see if they're locked.
The rest of you, start pulling out the big top.
She's dead.
Here now, Fred. Fred.
I gonna get you to the doctor.
Do not worry buddy.
Let's go.
 And so, behind these gates is buried the legend of a death 
 that was beyond human powers 
 and he played with things that no man should play. 
Here's another flash on that highway bus accident.
Dan McCormick, the lone survivor is been... taken to the receiving hospital for observation.
Attending physicians are astounded at his condition... because he shows no effects of the electrocution... that killed the driver of the bus and all of his fellow passengers.
You say the man is conscious?
Yes, it's the most amazing thing I've ever heard of doctor.
After a good night's rest he'll be ready to leave the hospital.
Come on, come on, give me those pants. I want to get out of here.
- Here, here, what's going on?
- I can't make him stay in bed doctor.
But I guess I ain't as tough as I thought I was.
Tough? You're lucky to be alive after a shock like that.
- Now get back into bed and take it easy.
- Ok, ok, you're the doctor.
This is Dr. Lawrence. Doctor, Don McCormick.
How do you do?
Dr. Lawrence wants to ask you a few questions.
Sure, glad to have somebody to talk to.
You know, for a minute I thought you was one of those reporters.
No, no, there are several of them downstairs.
- You won't like for publicity.
- Oh say, that's great.
I can use a couple good write ups in my business.
- What is your business Dan?
- Oh, didn't you know?
I run a high pitch down on the Midway, it's an act.
I'm dynamo Dan, the electrical man.
Fool around with storage batteries and stick my fingers into light sockets and... make sparks jump between my hands.
- You know, yokel shockers.
- Yokel shockers?
Sure, stuff to fool the peasants.
- It's all for effect, most of it's phony.
- Yes, I see.
Hey doc, get a load of this.
Supper in bed and I ain't even sick.
Yes, we going to make sure they take good care of you.
Well, I must run along now. Here's my card.
When you get out of here, just drop in and see me sometime.
- Sure, sure doc.
- Good bye.
So long doc.
Nice guy the doc.
Dr. Lawrence is one of
America's foremost scientists.
No kidding.
Dr. John Lawrence, 515
Forrest Drive, The Moors.
- Thank you Henry, that's all tonight.
- Thank you sir.
- Good evening Dr. Lawrence.
- Wong.
- Hello uncle John.
- Hello dear.
Oh, look at you.
- What's the matter? No date tonight?
- Yes and a very nice one,
And I waited to tell you about your tickets.
- Tickets? Tickets, what tickets?
- For the convention.
- Oh, yes, yes, when do I leave?
- First thing Wednesday morning.
Well, that gives me a couple of days.
- I've listed the references that you wanted.
- Oh, can't we get out of that?
I detest speeches.
It's probably because I've had to listen to so many in my time.
Well, here's your chance to get even, not that yours will be boring.
I wish I could be sure of that but electrobiology sounds terrifying.
Except to electrobiologists and that's who you'll be talking to.
Well, good night.
- We'll hope for the best.
- See you in the morning.
Oh and don't forget your medicine, I left it on your desk.
- I said good night.
- Good night.
Paul, why don't you give this up?
It will work, I know it.
With all the constructive things to be done, why do you concentrate on destruction?
- You call my work destructive?
- Must we go over that all again?
This theory of yours isn't science, it's black magic.
I believe that electricity is life... that men can be motivated and controlled by electrical impulse... supplied by the radioactivities of the electron.
That eventually a race of superior men could be developed... men whose only wants are electricity.
But man, you're challenging the forces of creation.
The forces of creation, bah.
You know as well as I do that half the people in the world are... doomed to a life of mediocrity... born to be nonentities, millstones around the neck of progress.
Men who have to be fed, watched, looked over and taken care of by superior intelligence.
My theory is to make these people of more use to the world.
By successive treatments, their bodies could be so electrolyzed... that they are no longer subject to the pains and frailties of ordinary mankind.
- Sometimes I think you're mad.
- I am.
So was Archimedes, Galileo, Newton Pasteur,
Lister and all the others who dared to dream.
50 years ago, a man was mad to think of anesthesia.
40 years ago, the idea of operating on the brain was madness.
Today, we hold a human heart in our hands and watch it beat.
Who can tell what tomorrow's madness may be?
No one Paul, least of all I.
Since I too believe that we've only scratched the surface of electrobiology.
But science through the ages is been used for the betterment of mankind... to give some faint ray of hope to these nonentities, as you call them.
But...
Now, now, now, together we've been very successful.
Let's drop it for tonight.
You hurry and clean up, there's some cheese and beer in the kitchen.
I'll make a welsh rabbit and we'll celebrate.
What do you say?
- Alright John.
- Good.
I won't be a moment.
- Do you like it?
- It's terrible.
Say, who are you?
- Mark Adams.
- Oh?
So you're Mark Adams, the big newspaper man.
Well, I have something to say to you.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Five people killed and the best thing you can do is write bad jokes.
Under his own power.
Oh, well look lady, five people were... killed and we treated it with the proper respect but that was yesterday.
Now the globe dispatch has a circulation of 300,000... say a million readers and they don't want to read anymore about the five that died.
They want to read about the one that lived Dan McCormick.
Where is he?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, come, come.
By the way, what makes you think he's here?
Well, I bought the fourth floor nurse a... dollar dinner and found the taxi cab that brought him here.
Now come on, get with the news item.
What's Dr. Lawrence's angle?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Ok, I'll wait.
You wasting your time, there's nobody here.
Nobody but us dogs.
Hey, you must be alright, he doesn't usually make friends so easily.
Sure, me and dogs always get along.
- What are your plans?
- Oh, I don't know.
I was headed for the county fair when that accident happened.
I was going to open up my act, guess I'm too late now.
Suppose I'll have to do something else.
In the meantime?
Well, in the meantime there's always that... good old 18 bucks a week from the unemployment insurance.
Of course, that doesn't start for a couple of weeks.
- Now, why don't you come and work with me?
- Eh?
- I say why don't you come and work with me?
- What doing?
Well, I was thinking about that electric act you used to do.
Oh, I already told you that was a phony.
Nevertheless, you survived an electrical shock that killed 5 other people.
Maybe it wasn't such a fake after all.
Maybe you've built up an immunity to electricity.
- What's that?
- Immunity?
Ordinarily, fatal doses of electricity can't hurt you.
Oh, you mean kind of like I was vaccinated against it?
Something like that.
Some cellular or glandular change is taken place which renders you immune.
- I'd like to find out what that is.
- Hey, wait a minute.
You don't mean you want to cut me open?
No, no, no, just take your blood count, examine your muscular coordination and... study your reflexes.
If we can find out what it is that produces this immunity against electricity... we might be the means of saving the hundreds of lives... that are lost every year through accidental electrocution.
You'd live right here too.
- You mean I get to eat here too?
- Surely.
Take it easy until you're well and strong again.
That's good enough for me.
Dr. Rigas, come here a minute.
He's my associate. Dr. Rigas,
I want you to meet Dan McCormick.
- Good morning sir.
- Hi you doc.
I've been trying to persuade
Mr. McCormick to come work with us... while we study his apparent immunity to high-voltage electrical shock.
Oh yes, yes, of course, forgive me.
I didn't recall the name for a moment.
- You're the one...
- Yes, I'm the one that lived.
And I've assured him that we would do nothing to injure his health in the slightest today.
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Well, then let's get to work.
What say, pup?
You ready Corky? Go get it.
- Good morning miss June.
- Good morning Dan.
- Lovely day, isn't it?
- Oh, sure is.
Well, are you beginning to feel at home around here?
Yeah, you know, every day around here is like Sunday on the farm.
- They're not working you too hard then?
- No.
Boy, they just give me a little shot of electricity and feel my pulse... and look in my eyes and tap me on the knee, you know how doctors do.
Oh, doesn't the electricity hurt?
No, I used to take more than this six times a day when I had my carnival act.
You know miss June, you look mighty pretty with those flowers in your arms.
Thank you Dan.
You reminded me of a girl
I used to be kind of sweet on.
She had a high wire act in one of the big Mac shows.
- What happened to her?
- Oh, she ran away with the fire eater.
Well don't worry Dan, I won't do that.
Hi Corky, come here kid.
Give me that ball, give me that ball.
- Good morning Miss Lawrence.
- Well, you do get around, don't you?
- How goes the great experiment?
- Nicely, thanks.
- How long is a thing like this take?
- Oh, weeks, months, a year perhaps.
You see, when a scientific discovery is announced to the world...
To the world, it must be proved beyond chance.
Well, you had a week now.
What progress have you to report?
Oh, I think we can safely say that the preliminaries have been completed.
Well, that's fine, now we can get to the main bow, what you doing tonight?
Why Mr. Adams, I thought you were here professionally.
Well, if you think there's anything amateur...
Look June, you're making it awful tough for me, I'm trying to romance with you and what do I get?
- Biology.
- By the greatest authority in the world.
Well, maybe is.
But if you're interested in the subject,
I too have a few ideas along these lines.
Hi. Oh, I hope I didn't interrupt.
No, it's all right,
I wasn't getting anywhere.
Hey, you and Corky seem to be getting along all right.
Sure, him and me gets along swell.
Say, you want to see something? Get a load of this.
Alright Corky, lay down, down.
That's it, turn over on your side.
Over, hold it, hold it.
Now, clear up on your back, turn over on your back, hold it.
Hold it, now back on your side.
No, no the other side.
Hold it, attaboy.
He learned that one quick.
I think maybe when I go back to the carnival, I'll get myself an animal act.
- Dan, will you come in here please?
- Sure.
No, not you. No, no, no.
I don't like that guy.
- You don't know anything about him.
- Do you?
I know that much of the success of this laboratory is due to him.
- He's a genius in his line.
- Maybe.
But I'll bet he spent his childhood sticking pins in butterflies.
What do you think Corky?
- Hey doc?
- Yes?
- Where's Pete?
- Pete?
Yeah Pete the rabbit, in the end case there.
Oh, he worked yesterday.
- Now, if you step on this please.
- Sure.
Say, ain't we going to wait for Dr. Lawrence?
Dr. Lawrence is away for a few days attending a scientist convention.
He left full instruction about the experiment, now just relax.
That's right.
Down please, thank you.
Now just relax.
You're perfectly all right, you can get up now.
- Hey doc, what happened?
- Must've dozed off for a minute.
- Oh, feels like my hands are asleep.
- Oh, that's strange.
Just the usual voltage, enough to maintain your immunity.
Oh, I wouldn't know from that scientific talk.
- You all through with me now?
- - Yes, that's all for today.
- Ok. So long.
- Good bye.
Hi you Corky, come on kid, let's go, eh?
What's the matter?
Come on Corky, come on kid.
Come on, I won't hurt you.
Ah, it's good to be home.
Conventions are alright in their way but I'm for holding them all in my own living room.
Yes, I always thought them pretty much a waste of time... same old fogies with the same old theories.
Oh, this wasn't so bad.
Now our Latin American friends are really doing some worthwhile things.
By the way, where is Dan?
He was sitting out in the garden just a few minutes ago.
Maybe doesn't know what time it is.
- Wong, call Mr. McCormick.
- Yes doctor.
I'm worried about Dan.
Oh, what's the matter? Isn't he happy here?
I guess so but he seems to slowed down.
- Perhaps it's a reaction to our experiments.
- Oh, maybe we're crowding him too much.
I'll check the reports after luncheon.
He's coming now sir.
Oh, how are you Dan? Did they take good care of you while I was away?
Oh, I'm Ok doc.
Special for you Mr. Dan.
No thanks, I ain't hungry.
Finish your lunch doctor, I'll take care of him.
Take his plate back to the kitchen Wong, he may eat it later.
Yes doctor.
Uncle John, is something the matter with
Dan, something strange is happening to him.
Oh, nonsense child.
I admit he looks rather badly but as Dr. Rigas says... that might be the result of our experiments.
Well, I wish you'd make sure.
I will, now that we've got that scientific conference out of the way.
Have you any idea what might be wrong?
Well, nothing definite but you remember the goldfish?
- Goldfish?
- Digs and Betty, in your office.
- Oh, yes, yes, of course.
- They died.
That's too bad.
- Something in the water, eh?
- Yes sir, electricity.
Paul, look here.
- June asked me to give you this.
- Oh yes, yes, thanks.
- What you make of Dan's condition?
- As I suspected, he's nervously upset.
- I ordered a few days rest.
- Take a look at this blood specimen.
Seems me be way below normal in cortisol count.
It was taken from his arm this morning.
Nothing much like the specimen we took from him when we first arrived, is it?
No, isn't.
- I don't know what to make of it.
- Have you kept a record of his treatments?
Of course, I'll get it.
Here it is doctor, I think you'll find everything according to your instructions.
Oh...
I don't know what's the matter with me, I'm weak as a kitten.
Oh, you overtaxed yourself at that convention.
Probably.
Why won't you go upstairs and lie down for a while?
You watch Dan carefully, we mustn't let anything happen to him.
Well, of course, I'll take care of him.
You go to bed.
It's been a good many years since I've been tucked in.
- It's very pleasant being waited on.
- Are you sure you'll be all right?
I hate to run out on your like this, but it's Mark's night off and we planned...
Now, I understand perfectly, and please don't worry about me.
Well, here your reference books and your paper and your pencil.
- If you take my advice, you go to sleep.
- Thanks.
- There just a few things I want to look up.
- Promise?
- Yes, I promise. Now run along.
- Good night.
Good night.
Well Dan, I have here a nationally advertised cigarette, now if you watch closely...
I'll put the cigarette in the palm of my left hand and make it disappear.
Now watch me.
Right out through the elbow, pretty good, eh?
How about a little card trick?
Yeah, you like card tricks? I've a standard deck of playing cards here.
Now if you just pick any card out of the deck, any card at all.
Don't let me force the Ace of spades on you.
Any card, that's it, take one of those right there.
That's fine, now... if you look at the card, remember what it is and put it back in the deck.
Ok, put it back in the deck there, anywhere at all, just... slide it in there, that's it, put it in there...
Hey Dan?
What goes on in here?
I don't know. I'm showing Dan some card tricks and I guess I didn't go over so big.
How's Dr. Lawrence?
Oh, he's much better, I made him promise go to sleep early.
What seems be the matter with him?
Well, overwork I guess, he was pretty nauseated and awfully weak.
Sounds like someone is been dishing out mickeys around here.
Mickey?
Yeah, that's a little thing they give you when your presence is no longer required.
Now, where would uncle
John get a thing like that?
Dan, I'm ready for you.
Mark, I'm not going.
- There's something wrong around here.
- It certainly isn't with Dr. Rigas.
Dan seemed anxious enough to go in there with him.
Yes, that's just it.
Dr. Rigas seems to have some sort of a hold on him that the rest of us don't know about.
Oh June, don't go Edgar Allan Poe on me.
Look, you see these tickets?
They cost a buck 10 a piece.
And when a newspaper man lays out cash for tickets, that is true love.
Hurry up, will you doc?
- You like these treatments, don't you Dan?
- Yeah.
They make me feel strong like I used to.
- They wear off too quick.
- Oh well, we'll fix that.
Now stretch out please.
That's right.
This is our final experiment.
If we're successful... we shall have proven a theory that will revolutionize the world.
A theory that will silence completely those scoffers who babble of trivialities.
And we shan't be disturbed.
I've taken care of that.
Yeah, that's what I thought you said.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Better?
Look June, this is a big night, I got a lot of important things to do and say... but I can't get started if you're not going to pay attention to me.
- Oh Mark, I...
- Now wait a minute, let me finish.
I had this whole routine all worked out.
The show, supper, a little music, you know, sort of work up to a gradual like..., and now you dust me off with the first pitch.
What's the matter? Don't you want to go?
Of course I want to go and I want the dancing and I want the supper... and most of all I want to hear what you have to say.
But Mark, I'm worried.
Take me back to the laboratory and let me check on uncle John and Dan... and make sure they're alright... and then wind yourself up for some enthusiastic cooperation.
Now you made a deal.
Now you'll do exactly as I say.
Step down from there.
Success.
Even more than I'd hoped.
Come.
Now, point your finger at that condenser.
Stop, that's the power of the energy in you.
We must conserve it, I've prepared for that.
Come over here.
Get into this rubber suit, it'll insulate you.
That will save the electricity that's giving you your strength.
With these rubber gauntlets, your power is safe.
Without them, it will run from you through everything you touch.
There you are, not
Dan McCormick but something I created.
Obeying my will, I can give you life or take it from you.
- Paul, what are you doing?
- Finishing the experiment... that proves once and for all that my theory of electrobiology is correct.
Look, there he stands, the shell of a man.
Electrically alive, every impulse controlled by me.
Come here.
- You must be mad.
- Of course I'm mad.
The while you were fooling with the conventions, I had conquered destiny.
Think of an army of such creatures, doing the work of the world, fighting its battles.
Look at him, the worker of the future, controlled by a superior intelligence.
We must assemble all the great scientists and show them this creature, we must...
- Where going?
- To call the police.
- You destroyed a human being, that's murder.
Oh please don't, you're a brother scientist, you must understand.
What is one life compared to this discovery?
Oh, he'll live, a beautiful existence.
No pain, no sorrow. John, don't.
Stop him.
Dan, Dan. Don't you know...
That's enough, let him go.
He's dead.
You killed him, remember that. You killed him.
When they ask you, you tell them. You killed him.
You come, I must get that power out of you.
Come.
Hold that.
You'll remember nothing of what happened except what I told you.
You killed him.
I killed him.
Alright sugar, take your look and let's get going.
Uncle John.
What happened?
Dr. Lawrence came into the laboratory to check the treatment I was giving our patient.
I left the room for a moment, there was a crash.
When I came back, our patient was choking Dr. Lawrence.
- I was too late to help.
- Do you mean to say Dan killed him?
- I don't believe it.
- Ask him.
Dan, it's a lie, isn't it?
You didn't kill Dr. Lawrence, did you?
Come on Dan, we're your friends. Did you kill him?
I killed him.
- Is Mr. Stanley in his office?
- I'll see, what is your name please?
June Lawrence.
- Yeah?
- Miss Lawrence to see you.
Have her come in. Dr. Lawrence's secretary.
- You go ahead with the preliminaries.
- Yes sir.
Come in Miss Lawrence.
Mr. Stanley, I want to talk to you about Dan McCormick.
Of course, sit down.
- Now, what about Dan McCormick?
- Dan didn't kill Dr. Lawrence.
- He's signing a statement that says he did.
- I know but Dan couldn't kill anything.
He was kind and gentle.
Well, something is happened to change Dan completely, something terrible.
Must've to make him confess a murder he didn't commit.
Now Miss Lawrence, your uncle died of a broken neck, caused by a brutal choking.
A powerful man did that.
Now you yourself admit that Dan and Dr. Rigas were alone in the laboratory at the time.
- Have you any reason to suspect Dr. Rigas?
- Oh, I'm all mixed up.
Maybe Dan did kill him, but he wasn't himself.
Now, now, wait a minute, take it easy.
- How long have you known Dan McCormick?
- Ever since he came to work for my uncle.
Get along all right together?
Went out to dances and parties and so forth?
Oh?
I see what you mean, no, we've never been out together.
I'm engaged to Mark
Adams of the globe dispatch.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm not more coherent in telling my suspicions but... don't treat this like an ordinary killing.
There's something tragic behind this.
- And now with this confession...
- Of course you must realize that a... confession cannot be accepted by the court as conclusive evidence... when the charge is first degree murder, I still have to prove my case.
I know but you'll introduce the confession and it's bound to influence the jury.
Miss Lawrence, I give you my word... that I will do everything I can possibly to help Dan McCormick.
Then find out if
Dr. Rigas has actually been... following my uncle's instructions in the laboratory.
The District Attorney moving swiftly through the preliminaries... promises a speedy trial in the case of Dan
McCormick, the so called electrical man... accused of murdering Dr. John
Lawrence, noted scientist.
To expedite matters, he is requested the appointment of a commission... to determine McCormick's sanity.
Dr. Rigas, the District
Attorney would like to see you.
Of course, show him in.
How do you do Dr. Rigas?
We're sorry to disturb you sir.
I wasn't doing anything of importance.
We'd like to have you explain just what treatments Dan McCormick was undergoing... and what bearing, if any, they might have on his condition.
- Of course, won't you sit down?
- No, thank you.
Well, here's the case history.
I completed a record of the experiments and treatments... given in accordance with Dr. Lawrence's instructions.
I see.
Just what was the purpose of these experiments?
Dr. Lawrence was trying to determine what furnished the immunity... that enabled Dan to escape electrocution in that accident.
That called for quantities of electricity to be given, did it not?
Oh no, just small amounts, enough to maintain immunity as that chart shows.
I see,
Did this application affect any change in him?
Well, he did become moody and irritable, but I can't see what connection there is... between that and the mild treatment he received here.
What's this doc?
Looks like an operating table?
Oh, that's an electro thermostatic table.
We've succeeded in curing many malignant diseases with electrical heat.
Would you care to try it?
No thanks doctor, I'll take your word for it.
I wish he could tell us what he thinks.
Oh well, all dogs respond to certain vibrations.
I remember my aunt Hattie's house, that's aunt Hattie on my father's side, she had...
Oh, it's no use Mark,
I'm worried and I'm scared.
I feel sure that
Dr. Rigas did something to Dan.
I'm worried about what it is, and I'm scared we won't found in time.
Yes, so am I sugar.
How about your paper?
Won't they help? Don't they want to know?
Yes, if we could go to them with something definite.
I tried to tell the chief what we suspected and he started calling a man in a white coat.
Of course, of course, anyone who commits murder must be momentarily insane.
Otherwise they wouldn't do it.
Well Dr. Rigas, thank you for your courtesy.
Don't hesitate to call me any time I can be of help.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- Dr. Rigas?
- Yes.
Dan was insane, wasn't he?
They can't hold him legally responsible, can they?
That will be determined tomorrow.
- Yes but those doctor's, they...
- Don't worry.
Dan's business will be taken care of.
The District Attorney is invited me to be present at the examination.
You have been reluctant to discuss the night of the crime... but I assure you that your reticence will not prejudice us against you.
We want you to feel perfectly at your ease.
You did kill Dr. Lawrence?
I killed him.
Perhaps if we go back over your boyhood again... we can find some mental meeting ground.
As I remember your story... you were brought up in an orphanage.
There was a man there, he hit you often.
He hit you hard.
He hurt you, you cried.
Nobody would help you.
All your life, you've been anxious to get even with him.
In your mind Dr. Lawrence... was that man because he ordered the treatment that hurt you.
You did get even with him, didn't you?
You feel better, you keep telling yourself you got even.
No.
I... killed him.
And in conclusion,
I say without hesitation... that the accused Dan McCormick, suffers from acute melancholia.
- Induced by a persecution complex...
- In our opinion then... is that make him mentally irresponsible?
In other words, is he legally insane?
On the contrary, he is decidedly sane... and definitely responsible.
Thank you doctor.
You've already testified that you're a newspaper man.
- That's right.
- A feature writer?
Well, my stuff carries a byline.
Then you'd do almost anything to get a good story, wouldn't you?
I'd do anything I could to save an innocent man if that's what you mean.
Thank you, that's all.
And when I returned to the laboratory... the accused was standing over the body of Dr. Lawrence.
- What did he say?
- He kept repeating, I killed him.
The cause of death was a severe dislocation and... partial fracture of the third and fourth cervical vertebrae.
- In other words, a broken neck.
- That is correct.
Thank you.
We find the defendant guilty as charged.
To be put to death before midnight of the 29th of May... in the manner prescribed by law.
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is your local reporter bringing you... interesting highlights on the day's news.
First, let's consider the case of Dan McCormick.
The man who used to do an electrical act at fairs and side shows.
Well, ironically enough, the last act of his little drama will find him... dying in the electric chair where all the immunity in the world won't help him.
Alright, Dan.
Well, looks like he's on his way.
Oh, be careful.
What's the matter, getting jumpy?
I guess so, these things always get my goat man.
Hello Joe?
Well, he just went into the execution chamber.
Mark is inside to watch him go.
What? Sure I can speak up.
No, there's nothing the matter with my voice.
Did you ever cover an execution?
That's what I mean.
Well, that's that.
- I could do with a drink.
- Me too.
Hey Sully...
- What's going on up there?
- Oh, I don't know.
Joe, they gave him three shots and he's still alive.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Say Mike, did you hear that?
Must be some wrong in there.
He's taken all they can give him.
Listen to this, they can't kill him. He just killed two guards in the execution chamber.
He just broke through, he's headed for the yard.
Hey, you hear that?
Don't touch him, he's full of electricity.
He just broke through, he's headed for the gate.
He's got the warden with him but they can't shoot.
Poor guy is walking dead.
No, the warden can't run.
If he starts Dan will grab him and he'll shrivel up like a potato chip.
Has anybody seen him?
Take it easy.
Have you had any trace of him since he walked out of the prison?
Boys, I'll be absolutely frank with you, I haven't heard a word.
The experts say that he can't live more than three hours.
He broke out of prison at 11:15.
And right now he may be dying in some out of the way spot.
Maybe hours before we find what's left of him.
Here's a late bulletin on the McCormick escape.
The body of warden Harris is been found in the woods near State Prison.
Apparently, the warden tried to get away from McCormick and was electrocuted.
McCormick is still at large, a menace to everything and everybody.
Three men died during his escape and countless others are in danger.
Stay indoors, refuse an admittance to your home and notify the police if you see him.
He can only live a few hours because the electricity which gives him life... is running out of his body with every step he takes.
Fred.
- Hey.
- Fred.
Mary Beth.
You can absolutely quote me as saying that the danger is passed... that the public has nothing...
- Yeah?
- Urgent on one.
- Stanley speaking.
- My name is Frank Davis.
I'm at the Lakeside Rod and Gun Club.
A man just came out of the bushes and scared my wife.
- It must be that escaped convict McCormick.
- Yeah?
Alright, thanks
Mr. Davis, I'll take care of it.
Sergeant, I want you to have 10 men, two squad cars downstairs in five minutes.
- Yes sir.
- What happened?
McCormick just scared the life out of some people out at Lakeside... and he's stolen a pair of rubber boots.
- Rubber boots?
- But then he won't die.
- Did you say lakeside?
- Yes.
- Well, that's out at the Moors.
- Yes.
Hey, put aside, hey look out.
Get away from that steed.
Attention all police and sheriff details...
Dan McCormick, convicted murderer who escaped from State Prison tonight... is somewhere in the neighborhood of Oak Road and Crescent drive, the Moors.
- He's headed for the laboratory.
- Step in it Reagan.
- May I help you?
- I was just tidying up a bit.
- How nice.
- Yes.
- Well, I think I'll be going.
- Is this what you wanted?
Go on, take it, read it.
It contains a most amazing record of the extraordinary experiment... was only completed tonight when Dan McCormick walked away from the electric chair.
I knew you'd done something terrible to him.
Terrible? Was it terrible that I gave him life?
I haven't made a great discovery and I present him with a spectacular demonstration.
Tonight, the whole world will be talking about Dan McCormick... not a handful of musty scientists but the whole world.
You mean, you deliberately let Dan go to jail when you might have saved him?
- At first, I intended to...
- But...
No, no, no, no, no, he really killed your uncle.
Sure, he was under my control at the time... and didn't know what he was doing but he killed him.
My efforts of controlling, in fact were so successful... that the temptation of putting him to the supreme test proved too strong.
- And they gave him a sanity test.
- Yes.
Ironical, isn't it?
Dan McCormick as you knew him was doomed... from the first day he came to this laboratory.
For years, I'd hoped to find a subject with immunity... that would enable me to test my theories.
You mean you deliberately destroyed him?
I killed one human life in order to prove one great scientific truth.
You know, it's a curious fact... that ever since my earliest experiments with rabbits and Guinea pigs...
I've always found the female of the species... was more sensitive to electrical impulse than was the male.
It's fortunate that we met here.
Shall I show you how it's done?
Dan...
Stop, stop Dan, stop.
Stop, I tell you. Dan.
Stop, I tell you. Stop.
Can't you hear me? Stop.
I'll take the power out of you.
Dan, it's the police.
Dan, don't run away, we know what they did to you.
Here's the book, there must be some way to cure you.
Dan please?
Alright, Lachlan Mack, come with me. Sergeant, cover the ground.
Blake, Murphy, around that way, the rest of you fellas come with me.
- Rigas.
- Electrocuted.
Dan?
Look.
He's just out at across the field.
- He's carrying something.
- It's a body.
- June.
- June?
Dan, Dan, where you going?
Dan.
He's going to hit the fence.
Dan, Dan, put me down.
- He's caught on the barbed wire.
- Dan.
If that cuts through that rubber suit, he's finished.
Dan.
Dan, get away from that fence.
The electricity is running out.
And when Dan carried me out of the laboratory, I held onto it.
- Is anyone else seen it?
- No one alive.
We can have photographs of the notebook and... and photostats of the pages in Rigas' own handwriting.
- Do you think you ought to print it?
- Do I think I ought to print it?
Why, the story will get me the Pulitzer prize.
Do you want to make it possible for someone else to do what's been done to Dan?
Well no but...
Yeah, I see what you mean.
