[Bell tolling]
What is it, Latham?
It's nearly 10:00, Inspector.
I have a carriage waiting.
Carriage? What carriage?
You wanted to look at that place in the park this morning.
Don't you recall, sir?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
Confounded nuisance, spending one's time on routine investigations.
I'd hardly call this routine, sir.
PIERCE: What would you call it?
Why, I'd say it was highly unusual... a man being attacked by a werewolf in a London park.
PIERCE: Werewolf?
I'm surprised at you, Latham.
I always looked upon you as an intelligent man.
Where on earth did you get this
"werewolf" idea?
I know. You've been looking at the papers.
- Well, they are full of it.
- Bosh!
PIERCE: From what I know of the case, the man was nipped by a stray dog.
It was much worse than that, sir.
He was very badly slashed.
He swears that it was not an animal that attacked him.
I suppose he was accosted by a man... who suddenly sprouted hairy ears and long fangs.
No, sir. No ears and no fangs.
As a matter of fact, it wasn't a man. It was a woman.
A little early in the morning to be visiting grog shops, isn't it?
Sir, I never touch a drop before 6:00 in the evening.
- Come along.
- Yes, sir.
[Cheerful instrumental music]
Fine morning, isn't it?
Much too fine to be wasted on minor things like stray dogs.
Well, Miss Allenby, are you prepared to accept defeat gracefully?
You haven't defeated me yet, Mr. Lanfield.
We're certainly formal this morning, aren't we, Phyllis?
Yes, we are.
Much too formal for two people who are going to be married next week.
- Next December.
- Next week.
This race is merely a formality.
You sure you don't want the handicap
I offered you?
- No, thank you.
- All right.
Do you mind if I review the terms of the race?
Just to refresh your memory.
As a lawyer, I don't want any loopholes.
I'll save you the trouble, sir.
"We race to the road in the glen...
"and the winner names our wedding day."
Which will be next December, because I'm going to win!
- And I adore winter weddings.
- And I detest them.
That's why I'm going to win.
- You ready?
- Ready.
- Start counting.
- One, two, three, go!
[Cheerful instrumental music intensifies]
Well, Miss Allenby,
I won fairly and squarely... and next week you'll become Mrs. Barry Lanfield.
You should've taken that five-length handicap I offered you.
I'm glad I didn't, Barry. You see, I...
I didn't really want to wait till next December.
You didn't?
LATHAM: You see?
They're woman's footprints,
Inspector. There's no doubt.
She came along the meadow, and probably went through this hedge.
You know, that fellow might've been telling the truth... about a female werewolf attacking him.
PIERCE: Stop that nonsense about a werewolf attacking.
LATHAM: Sorry, Inspector.
- Can we get through this brush?
- Here's a spot, sir.
PIERCE: We'll have a look on the other side.
LATHAM: Let me help you, sir. Thank you.
Here we go.
What's the matter, Phyllis?
You look frightened.
Those voices startled me.
Shall we go?
Yes, now that we have an audience, the spell is broken.
We seem to have interrupted a romantic moment.
When I was courting my missus, we used to go horseback riding.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
Then we got married, and she refused to go near a horse from that moment.
She only pretended to like riding until she got me well-hooked.
When you finish mooning about your courting days... perhaps we can get on with the business in hand.
I'm sorry, Inspector. Come on.
You look very thoughtful.
I have many things on my mind.
After all, I'm to be a bride next week.
That's not what's troubling you.
Are you upset because of what the constables were saying?
Frankly, I am.
It's not a very comfortable feeling... to know that such weird things are taking place... in the park so close to where one lives.
Certainly you don't believe those newspaper stories about werewolves?
That's just sensational trash... the sort of thing one reads in penny dreadfuls... if one reads penny dreadfuls.
- You don't read them, do you?
- Of course not.
It's just that I guess I'm on edge, because...
Well, there's no man in our house.
Your worries will be over next week, when you move into my diggings.
In the meantime, I don't think you'll roam the park at nights.
Not if I can help it.
[Sombre instrumental music]
[Dogs barking]
CAROL: Hannah.
HANNAH: Yes, Miss Carol.
Will you do something for me while doing the marketing?
Of course, miss.
Do you want me to fetch something?
No, I want you to deliver something.
Please leave this at the chemist, on the corner near the greengrocer.
Just say that someone will call for it this afternoon.
Will you do that?
So it's Cupid I'm playing this fine morning!
CAROL: Yes. And the note is very important.
HANNAH: They always are at your age.
Don't fret. I'll see that it's delivered quickly.
Thank you very much, Hannah.
MARTHA: Hannah!
HANNAH: Yes, Mrs. Winthrop?
HANNAH: Is there something else you've thought of...
- for me to bring from the market?
- No.
I'll take that note Carol handed to you.
HANNAH: Note? What note?
Quickly. I saw you put it in your basket.
CAROL: But, mother, it's only a...
MARTHA: I'll see what it is.
Give it to me before I lose patience and discharge you.
- I'm sorry, Miss Carol.
- Run along and do your marketing.
[Hannah huffs]
- I thought so.
- Mother, you've no right to...
To keep you from making a fool of yourself... over a worthless fellow like Dwight Severn?
- Is that what you were about to say?
- I love Dwight.
And he's not worthless.
He's fine and sweet and considerate and...
And hasn't a penny to his name.
Come in the house, Carol.
I want to talk to you.
Sit down.
I'm certain you imagine yourself madly in love... with this starving young artist of yours.
But have you given any thought to what happens to us... the moment Phyllis marries Barry Lanfield?
I imagine things will go on pretty much the same.
Of course, we'll miss her.
It's not as simple as that, Carol.
That's why I'm delving into the past now... to tell you of certain things...
I probably should have explained to you long ago.
The reason I haven't told you is... that your happiness has always been uppermost in my mind.
First, I think you should know... you're not Phyllis's cousin.
You're not related to her in any way.
I don't understand.
- You're her aunt, and...
- No.
I'm not related to her, either.
I'm only the woman who might have married Reginald Allenby.
- Reginald Allenby? Phyllis' father?
- Yes.
This is the note he sent me... the day before I married your father.
Read it.
"My own darling...
"I know that nothing I can say will change your mind.
"I wish you every happiness, even though my heart tells me...
"I shall never quite get over loving you.
"Reggie."
Of course, he did get over it.
Disappointed suitors generally do.
He married Phyllis's mother... just one year after I married your father... a man as penniless as the precious young man you wish to marry.
And when your father died, leaving me with a small child... and practically no money,
I had to fend for myself.
That's how I happened to become the housekeeper... of the Allenby's London house.
This house.
This house isn't ours?
No, it belongs to the Allenby estate... meaning Phyllis, because she's the only heir.
[Dog barking]
PHYLLIS: Barry!
Stop it! Go away!
Barry!
Stop it. Go away.
[Dog continues barking]
BARRY: Get back!
Come here, Rolf.
I really can't understand it.
He's so gentle around everyone but Phyllis.
He was anything but gentle a moment ago.
Why don't you get rid of them,
Mrs. Winthrop?
I bought them for protection.
You know what's going on in the park.
Perhaps if Phyllis tried to make friends with them.
Talk to him. Let him know you're not afraid of him.
There might be something in what she says.
Try petting him, see what happens.
[Dog barking ferociously]
No. Take him away, please!
Very well, my dear. Come along.
I'll lock him in the garden.
I'm sorry I'm such a coward, Barry.
I don't blame you for being afraid, the way he was carrying on.
[Dog continues barking]
[Dogs whining and howling]
[Sombre instrumental music]
[Door opens]
[Phyllis gasps]
PHYLLIS: Aunt Martha. You startled me.
MARTHA: I'm sorry, Phyllis.
MARTHA: I heard you stirring about.
MARTHA: I thought I'd just look in and say good night.
What in the world is that?
It's a lantern.
But why did you hang it out there?
I thought it might keep the dogs from making such a racket.
PHYLLIS: They've been at it all evening.
Come now, my dear.
You can tell me the truth.
PHYLLIS: What do you mean?
I'm familiar with that old Scottish superstition... of hanging out a lighted lantern when dogs howl... to drive away the evil spirits.
But you're far too intelligent
to believe in anything so silly.
Am I? I wonder.
- Certainly you are.
- Leave it there.
But why?
Because I want it there.
Isn't that reason enough?
Just as you say, dear.
Wait.
Aunt Martha, I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm all on edge.
Those dogs and their constant howling are driving me frantic.
And the things that have been happening in the park...
You poor child.
You really are upset, aren't you?
You mustn't let yourself go to pieces like this.
MARTHA: Now, get into bed.
MARTHA: I'll fetch you some warm milk from downstairs.
You'll sleep so soundly, you won't even hear the dogs.
Into bed with you.
[Soothing instrumental music]
I'll only be a minute.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Eerie instrumental music]
MARTHA: Carol.
Where are you going?
Answer my question.
I was going out for a breath of air.
It was stuffy in my room.
MARTHA: Why do you lie to me?
You were stealing out of the house to meet Dwight Severn.
Go to your room.
At once.
[Soft instrumental music]
Here you are, darling. Drink it.
And let's forget all about your nerves being on edge.
Thank you, Aunt Martha.
That's very sweet of you.
[Dogs howling in the distance]
Dismal sound, ain't it, Herbert?
Like lost souls looking for a place to rest.
Nothing quite as fancy, Alfred, if you ask me.
More like lost wolves looking for someone to tear to pieces.
Yeah, it's horrible, ain't it?
They do say the howling of a dog means death.
In that case, half of London must be at death's door at this minute.
[Child screaming]
That's no dog.
Sounds like a child. Here, come on!
[Ominous instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Blood.
Good morning.
Why, Phyllis, what's the matter?
It's happened. I knew it would happen.
MARTHA: What are you talking about?
PHYLLIS: Look.
MARTHA: The slippers are covered with mud.
PHYLLIS: Yes.
And the hem of my robe, it's wet.
As though I'd been walking in wet grass.
MARTHA: But you couldn't have been out.
Blood on my hands.
Aunt Martha, what have I done?
Where did I go last night?
Stop it, Phyllis.
You couldn't have been out. It's impossible.
But my hands... and the robe... the slippers...
And I had the most horrible dream.
I was walking on a desolate moor at night.
I was stalking someone.
To kill him.
It's the Allenby curse. I'm sure of it!
Nonsense.
There's no such thing.
If there isn't...
I must be subject to spells of insanity.
I know you're upset, Phyllis, but you're not insane.
Now, get dressed. Come down to breakfast.
Act as if nothing has happened.
We don't want Carol to suspect that anything's wrong.
Understand?
You don't look well this morning,
Miss Phyllis.
Is something ailing you?
Phyllis is perfectly well, Hannah.
Now run along and fetch Carol's breakfast.
- She'll be down in a minute.
- Just as you say, ma'am.
- Do you think Hannah suspects?
- Of course not.
But she stared at me so strangely.
Be quiet.
- Good morning, Mother. Phyllis.
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, Miss Carol.
- Good morning, Hannah.
- How dreadful!
- What is it, Carol?
A small boy was killed last night in the park near Denham Lane.
Torn to pieces by an animal of some kind.
HANNAH: Denham Lane! Why, that's close by here.
CAROL: Yes, just a short way.
Less than a mile I'd say.
HANNAH: Not more than half a mile, if you ask me.
Hannah, get some more tea.
- What are you waiting for? Get it.
- Yes, ma'am.
It seems that the body of the child was horribly mangled.
Carol, please!
Help me get her upstairs.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Cheerful instrumental music]
- Hello, Barry.
- Good morning. Is Phyllis ready?
I promised I'd drive her to the dressmaker's this morning.
I'm afraid she can't go with you, Barry.
- Why not?
- She's ill.
Not too ill to receive a visitor, I hope.
I don't know. I'll go to her room and ask her. Come in.
I just can't live with myself knowing that I murdered that child.
MARTHA: You murdered no one.
MARTHA: Now, you must stop talking about it. Or even thinking about it.
The idea that a frail girl like you... could literally tear a boy of 10 to pieces is utterly ridiculous.
I wish I could believe that.
[Knocking on door]
MARTHA: Is that you, Carol?
CAROL: Yes, Mother.
MARTHA: What is it?
CAROL: Barry's here.
CAROL: I said you were ill and he wants to see you.
CAROL: Shall I have him come up?
PHYLLIS: No. Don't let him come up.
Tell him I can't see him.
I never want to see him again.
You can't possibly mean that, Phyllis.
Of course she doesn't mean it.
Explain that she's sleeping and asked not to be disturbed.
Tell him she'll see him tomorrow.
But I won't be able to see him tomorrow.
I'm positive you will, my dear.
Drink this.
MARTHA: It will calm your nerves.
Please, Phyllis.
You're keeping Barry waiting, Carol.
I'm never going to see Barry again,
Aunt Martha.
I just couldn't.
I'd feel...
I'd feel unclean.
- What're you doing here, Mr. Barry?
- Not so loud.
Go on with your work.
I want to ask you some questions.
- How's Phyllis this morning?
- She seems much better, sir.
She's in the garden now, getting some sun.
That's strange.
Mrs. Winthrop told me she was too ill to see me.
She's been telling me that for two days now.
Mrs. Winthrop is peculiar, if you ask me.
Only don't tell her I said so.
I won't, if you'll let me go through here to the garden.
Go ahead! What's holding you?
If you get caught,
I'll swear I never set eyes on you.
And I'll confirm it.
BARRY: Hello, darling.
PHYLLIS: Barry.
How did you get here?
I'll tell you about that later.
First, I want to talk to you.
Why have you been avoiding me, Phyllis?
I've been trying to see you
for the past two days.
Is that any way to treat the man you're marrying next Wednesday?
Barry, please. I can't talk about it now.
Phyllis, what's the matter?
It's Barry. Will you please ask him to go?
Barry, I didn't know you were here.
Where did Phyllis go? I must talk to her.
You'd better not.
You've upset her enough already.
How could I have upset her?
I walked into the garden... and asked why she's been avoiding me.
Perhaps because she didn't want you to see her while she was ill.
She's a sensitive girl.
Don't force the issue when she's feeling as she does now.
What's wrong with her?
What's come over her?
A girl about to be married should be in great spirits.
It's just a case of nerves.
I'm sure it's nothing serious.
In a few days, when she's feeling better... she'll be a different person.
In the meantime, I'll take good care of her.
You'd better go now.
CAROL: Hello.
BARRY: Good afternoon, Carol.
I know. You've been calling on the bride-to-be.
- How is she?
- I wish I knew.
Will you come for a drive with me?
I'd like to talk to you.
All right.
[Sombre instrumental music]
[Dogs barking]
LATHAM: Good evening.
Are you the lady of the house?
I'm a lady. But I only work here.
HANNAH: You are?
LATHAM: My name is Latham...
Criminal Investigation Department,
Scotland Yard.
HANNAH: Come in.
LATHAM: Thank you.
[Door closes]
I'll call Mrs. Winthrop right away.
Don't bother. You can give me the information I want.
How many people live in this house?
Four. Mrs. Winthrop, her daughter, her niece, and meself.
- No men?
- Not a man.
- Are there any dogs about the place?
- Yes, indeed!
And vicious beasts they are.
Every night they keep me awake with their howling.
You'd be doing me a great favour if you'd take them away.
It's a gentleman from Scotland Yard asking about the dogs.
Latham is the name, ma'am.
How do you do? I'm Mrs. Winthrop.
That will be all, Hannah.
I presume all dogs are under suspicion... in view of the strange happenings in the park.
If you wish me to get rid of them...
I had nothing like that in mind,
Mrs. Winthrop.
I imagine that you keep them for protection.
I can't say that I blame you, with no men about the place.
I don't suppose you allow the dogs to roam at large?
Certainly not. They're locked in the garden most of the time.
Especially at night.
Have you noticed any suspicious characters about the place?
No, I haven't.
Have the police any clue as to who murdered that boy in the park?
Well, not exactly a clue, as you might say.
Of course, we've narrowed it down to where we feel certain... that it's an animal from this neighbourhood, or a person.
- A person?
- Yes.
My own theory, Mrs. Winthrop, is that it's a were...
That a madman or a woman is responsible.
That's why I'm checking all the houses in this neighbourhood.
So if you do see any suspicious characters... notify the police at once, won't you?
- I certainly will.
- Yes.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
- Good night.
- Good night.
[Door opens]
[Dogs barking and howling in the distance]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
It can't be.
[Bell chiming]
[Knocking on door]
Come in.
- Do you mind?
- Of course not.
I'm glad you're still up. I want to talk to you.
What are you doing with the cotton?
I'm stuffing my ears so I won't hear those awful dogs.
Before you shut yourself off from the world entirely... do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions?
Not at all.
CAROL: Did you ever notice... what nice, broad shoulders I have?
What do you mean?
We've been confiding in each other for years.
Isn't there something you'd like to tell me?
No. Why do you ask?
I went riding with Barry this afternoon... and we talked about you most of the time.
We feel that the thing that's upsetting you... is more sinister than howling dogs.
If you'd tell me what it is, perhaps I can help.
Thanks, but there's nothing you can do.
PHYLLIS: There's nothing anybody can do.
All right.
But sometimes it's bad to keep things to oneself.
I'm keeping nothing from you... it's just that I'd like to be left alone, that's all.
Forget that I mentioned it.
I won't bring it up again.
I'm sorry, Carol. I didn't mean to be nasty.
- Please forgive me.
- There's nothing to forgive.
But if you ever do want to unload your troubles... remember what I said about these broad shoulders of mine.
And Barry has a nice set of shoulders, too.
What did Carol want?
She just dropped in to say good night.
I thought perhaps she brought you a message from Barry.
She went riding with him this afternoon.
Yes, I know.
I brought the coffee you asked for.
I think you're making a mistake drinking it this time of night.
You won't sleep a wink.
That's exactly why I'm having it.
I don't intend to sleep.
I'm going to fight this thing.
I'm going to make sure
I don't leave the house tonight.
Aren't you being a little foolish?
Rest will do you more good than anything else.
It's no use, Aunt Martha.
My mind's made up.
As you wish.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
[Ominous instrumental music]
[Dogs howling]
DRIVER: Go on, lad.
LATHAM: Good evening.
CONSTABLE: Good evening.
Yes, well, now, these are your reinforcements.
Inspector Pierce wants the park patrolled by officers... travelling in pairs until further notice.
Very good, sir.
You men pair off with the regular patrolmen.
They'll show you the ropes.
MAN #1: Very good.
MAN #2: All right.
I say, Constable... what's your theory about these strange goings-on?
There are quite a few stray dogs roaming the parks these nights.
I'm sure that one of the bolder ones has been attacking the people.
That's the Inspector's theory, too.
Has it ever occurred to you that it might be a werewolf?
You're pulling my leg, aren't you?
- There are no such things.
- The Inspector thinks that, too.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
[Sinister instrumental music]
[Dogs barking]
- Constable, anything new?
- No, sir.
Everything is comparatively quiet.
With the exception of a few dogs howling.
At the rate we're rounding them up... there'll be no dogs to howl tomorrow night.
I suppose you're still of the opinion... that when the park is cleared of the dogs the attacks will stop.
Certainly, sir. Aren't you?
I'm not so sure. Well, see you later.
Well, there's a barmy one.
He has an idea there's a werewolf at the bottom of all this.
- Barmy's what I calls it, too.
- Yes.
[Sinister instrumental music intensifies]
[Vicious growling and grunting]
[Latham exclaiming in terror]
Help!
Constable!
CONSTABLE #1: What happened, sir?
LATHAM: She's done me in.
CONSTABLE #1: She, sir?
The wolf-woman!
CONSTABLE #2: We'd better get him to a hospital.
I'm afraid it's a bit late for that.
He's a goner.
[Slow instrumental music]
PHYLLIS: Aunt Martha. How did you get in here?
MARTHA: Through the door, of course.
PHYLLIS: But I had it locked.
It wasn't locked, Phyllis.
[Ominous instrumental music]
It's happened again.
What have I done?
I don't know.
Your new white dress is torn and muddy.
And your shoes...
[Knocking on door]
MARTHA: Compose yourself.
[Knocking continues]
MARTHA: Is that you, Carol?
CAROL: Yes, Mother. May I come in?
Certainly, dear.
- Good morning, Phyllis.
- Good morning, Carol.
Barry's downstairs.
He suggested we go riding with him.
Would you tell him
I'm not up to it this morning?
Of course.
But won't you see him for a few moments?
He's terribly worried about you.
No, I can't see him.
She had a very restless night.
She's in no condition to have visitors.
That's not going to be much consolation for Barry.
Any message you'd like me to give him?
No. No message.
By the way, have you heard the news?
What news?
CAROL: A Scotland Yard man was murdered in the park... by a madwoman who made a noise like an animal.
The morning paper is full of it.
I murdered him!
Hush. You did nothing of the kind.
I know I did.
I'm going to a doctor.
I can't stand this any longer.
You'll do nothing of the sort.
I won't permit it.
If you told your story to a doctor... he'd have you committed to an asylum.
- You don't want that, do you?
- No.
[Phyllis exclaiming in despair]
Look.
That must be the place where the Scotland Yard man... was murdered last night.
I suppose so.
If I could only talk to Phyllis...
I'm sure that I could get her to tell me what's wrong.
Then why don't you?
How can I? Your mother insists she's too ill to see me.
Haven't you ever overruled a woman?
- Good morning, Barry.
- Good morning, Mrs. Winthrop.
Won't you come in?
[Door closes]
Carol's in the garden if you'd like to see her.
I didn't come to see Carol.
I'm going to take Phyllis for a drive in the country.
You must be joking.
She's much too ill to leave the house.
Suppose we let her be the judge of that, Mrs. Winthrop.
MARTHA: See here. You can't go upstairs.
BARRY: Why not?
Phyllis is going to be my wife.
I insist on seeing her.
MARTHA: I'm sure she'll refuse to go with you.
Cheer up, sobersides.
After all, this is better than moping in bed at home.
- Isn't it?
- Yes, I suppose it is.
BARRY: You don't know what a relief it is to see you perking up.
BARRY: It's good for you to get away from that house.
BARRY: I wonder why your aunt was so insistent I couldn't see you.
Aunt Martha was acting for my own good, to protect me.
To protect you? From what?
Look, darling...
I know something's been bothering you... and I want you to tell me what it is.
It isn't anything so serious we can't overcome it together.
After all, we are going to be married.
We can't be married, Barry. Ever.
Why not?
I can't tell you that.
It's just that it wouldn't be fair to you.
I think I understand.
You're not going to let me in for the curse of the Allenbys... and all that sort of thing. Is that it?
How did you know?
Carol mentioned your being frightened of howling dogs of late.
I merely added up the facts.
Please, let's not talk about it anymore.
We've got to talk about it.
You can't let yourself go to pieces over a thing like that.
I'm sure you place no stock in that silly legend... about your family being cursed by the wolves.
I'm not sure.
I know you scoff at the Allenby curse... but ever since my parents were killed...
I've had the strangest dreams.
Dreams in which it seemed
I lived a long time ago.
I took part in pagan rites.
I assumed the form of a wolf.
I even hunted with the wolves.
Those dreams are easily explained.
Someone probably told you weird stories about the curse... when you were a child.
Certainly, you don't believe in werewolves, do you?
Many people do.
There was an ancient tribe, the Hirpini... which worshipped wolves.
- But that was centuries ago.
- Yes.
But even today in Scotland, on nights when the dogs howl... people hang out lighted lanterns to ward off evil spirits.
You've evidently been reading up on the subject, haven't you?
Yes, I have.
Plato and Pythagoras on the transmigration of souls, I suppose.
Yes.
Don't tell me you've overlooked Shakespeare.
Let's see, now.
Merchant of Venice, wasn't it?
"Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith
"To hold opinion with Pythagoras
"That souls of animals infuse themselves
"Into the trunks of men.
Thy currish spirit
"Govern'd by a wolf who, hang'd for human slaughter
"Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
"And, whilst thou layest in thy
unhallowed dam
"Infus'd itself in thee for thy desires
"Are wolfish, bloody, starv'd and ravenous"
- Barry, stop it!
- Oh, darling.
I'm sorry. I didn't realise it would hit you like this.
I'm so terribly frightened.
Hold me tight, awfully tight!
[Phyllis sobbing]
I'm taking personal charge tonight.
These are my orders:
You are to arrest any person, man or woman... who cannot give a satisfactory reason for being in the park.
Furthermore, if anyone tries to avoid questioning by running away... you are to shoot after a single command to halt.
You've been provided with firearms for this emergency.
We'll start patrolling at once.
All right, men. To your posts.
I think I'll take a turn in the park myself.
- Very good, sir.
- All right.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music continues]
BARRY: Good evening.
CONSTABLE: Hold on, sir.
What are you doing in the park at this hour?
Frankly, I'm doing a little private investigating.
Planning to capture the she-wolf single-handed, I presume.
Something like that.
These weird stories in the newspapers fascinate me.
I'll have to trouble you for your name.
- My name is Barry Lanfield.
- Your occupation?
I'm a barrister, in partnership with my father.
- Not Sir Sidney Lanfield?
- Yes.
- Any credentials to prove it?
- Certainly.
[Suspenseful instrumental music intensifies]
[Growling and snarling]
MAN: Help!
Someone! Stop! Help!
What's happened, sir?
I was sitting on that bench... and this woman, or whatever it was... howled and grabbed me by the throat.
There!
MAN: There she is now.
CONSTABLE: After her, men. After her!
Did you get a look at her face?
No, I was much too busy protecting myself.
She seemed terribly strong for a woman.
Dwight, what happened?
I was waiting for you to show up... when this wolf-woman evidently decided to make me her next victim.
You poor darling. Are you badly hurt?
Pretty badly mussed up, but nothing serious.
- Hello, Carol.
- What are you doing here?
I might ask you the same question.
Dwight just answered that.
I came here to meet him.
Dwight, this is Barry Lanfield.
Barry, Dwight Severn.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
Just to make things cosy,
I'm Constable Ernie Hobbs.
Now that we all know each other... suppose we go to park patrol headquarters... and get acquainted with the Inspector.
He might have a few questions to ask, too. Come on, now.
[Knocking on door]
Good evening, Barry.
- Good evening.
- Come in.
I'll run upstairs and see if Phyllis is able to see you.
Later.
First, I'd like to ask you some questions.
- My, you sound serious.
- I am.
- Shall we go into the library?
- Certainly.
You may cross-examine me, Barrister... but do you mind if I sit down while you're doing it?
I think much better when I'm sitting down.
What I'm going to ask you will require a bit of thinking.
Quick thinking.
Did you know I saw you leave the house last night... and followed you to the park?
That's how you happened to be there when I met Dwight.
Yes.
And that's also how I happened to discover that you were the she-wolf.
Barry, you must be joking.
No, I'm quite serious.
CAROL: You can't possibly be serious.
BARRY: But I am.
Of course, you may not recall everything you did.
Insane people seldom do
when under stress.
I'm perfectly sane, and I was under no stress.
I went to the park for only one reason... to meet Dwight Severn.
I've been meeting him three nights
a week for the past two months.
BARRY: You're sure you went directly to the meeting place?
I am certain.
Do you mind if I ask a question?
Go ahead.
How did you happen to see me when I left the house last night?
I was worried about Phyllis.
I decided to watch the house all night.
Something she said when we were riding yesterday made me think...
You suspect that she might be the she-wolf, don't you?
I did... until I saw you steal out of the house.
Now I don't know what to think.
- Good evening, Barry.
- Good evening, Mrs. Winthrop.
Why didn't you let me know
Barry was calling, Carol?
I would've made you a cup of chocolate.
- I'll make it now.
- Please don't bother.
I just dropped by hoping I might see Phyllis.
I'm afraid you can't, Barry.
She's been terribly upset since you took her riding yesterday afternoon.
I don't know why it is, but you seem to be a disturbing influence.
Perhaps she'll feel better in the morning.
I'll drop around again then.
- Good night.
- Good night.
[Door closes]
You little fool!
I heard you say you've been meeting
Dwight Severn three times a week.
All right, Mother. You know now.
I've been seeing Dwight and I'll continue to see him.
Please don't lecture me again on why I should marry Barry Lanfield.
In fact, I'll be happy when he and Phyllis are married.
It will stop you from making him a constant topic of conversation.
Barry will never marry Phyllis.
She's insane.
[Dogs barking and howling]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
May I come in, Carol? I must talk to you.
Surely. Do come in.
MARTHA: You've decided to make a bold front of it... instead of sneaking out to meet your starving artist.
I'm not going to meet Dwight,
Mother. I'm going to get the police.
MARTHA: The police? But why?
Phyllis has just told me the whole story.
- What are you talking about?
- Her belief that she's a werewolf.
She showed me all the evidence, too.
At least you know that I was speaking the truth... when I said she was insane.
I don't believe she is insane.
I think she's the victim of a terrible hoax.
That's why I'm going
to ask the police to investigate.
MARTHA: That's ridiculous.
If you call in the police,
Phyllis will be placed in an asylum.
I'm calling them at her request, Mother.
[Soft instrumental music]
[Soft instrumental music continues]
[Door opens]
I brought you a glass of warm milk.
I don't believe I'll have any, Aunt Martha.
You must drink it. It'll quiet your nerves.
You'll be completely at ease... when you tell your story to the police.
You know about Carol calling the police?
Certainly, my dear.
I'm glad you've decided to bring everything out into the open... to clear up this terrible thing, whatever it is.
It's been quite a strain on me, too.
Drink it, Phyllis.
The police will ask you
hundreds of questions.
Do you think they'll take me away tonight?
Probably not.
Perhaps you won't even have to go to an asylum.
We'll have you taken care of in a private institution... until you're cured.
Take some more milk, Phyllis. Drink it all.
- Do you think I can be cured?
- Of course.
Doctors accomplish wonders with the human mind.
Finish it, dear. I'll take the glass.
How do you feel?
Answer me. How do you feel?
I feel terribly sleepy... as if I'd been drugged.
You're right.
I drugged you.
PHYLLIS: So I wouldn't hear the dogs?
No, Phyllis.
I'm going to kill you.
- Kill me?
- Yes.
You see, if the police came while you were still alive... they would investigate the strange story you would tell them.
They would call in a doctor... and he would find that you are perfectly sane.
So I'm going to kill you.
But why?
Because I planned all this to get you out of the way.
When I discovered you still believed
in the curse of the Allenbys...
I decided to drive you insane.
It would mean much to me... and to Carol.
For me, it would mean that I could stay on here in this house I love... that I managed for so many years.
For Carol... it would mean she could marry a man not beneath her station... a man like Barry Lanfield, who...
So I began by killing the little boy in the park... and led you to believe you did it.
Oh, no.
Later, I killed that meddling fool from Scotland Yard... because he was getting too close to the truth.
And my plan will still succeed, Phyllis... although it's changed slightly.
When the police come...
I shall tell them of your strange actions lately.
Barry and Carol will bear me out.
They will call it suicide, my dear... through fear of insanity.
[Door opens]
[Martha exclaiming]
[Tense instrumental music]
I heard you.
Now I know what you've been doing... with that drug you kept hid in my kitchen cupboard.
- Be quiet.
- No!
I'm going for the police.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
What's happened here?
Mother!
She's a murderer. It's the she-wolf herself.
Phyllis, are you all right?
It's Barry, darling.
She's going to kill me.
She killed the others.
No, dear.
She'll never kill anyone else.
- What's wrong?
- I have hungry.
Before dinner!
- The road is cut!
My appetite is not!
- The avalanche was here.
- We were yesterday! was doing good?
- Too many clouds!
- Risks for nothing!
- It's a risk we all have running!
- I prefer knitting!
- Tomorrow, organize a team of...
... volunteer to unlock road. Reunion at 5am, cool...
... food in the bag, one quarter of spirit and without problems!
- Until dinner, tell us the story he had promised...
...yesterday!
- Is not it too awful?
- The notary has order of the chief us the dinner chokes!
- Tonight, the story of Michel
Higelin and white ladies.
- Impatient, Mr. Perrier?
- I'm hungry, beautiful lady,
...Do not you see?
- What?
- That the eyes devoured.
- An increase worth!
- Here´s the man!
A little more...
Here´s the boss!
When do you eat?
It's always the same!
And the military precision,
We are hungry!
- Colonel!
- I promise to surprise you.
- What?
- Have you ever heard...
...shots?
- Not so close!
Those smugglers!
Fantastic!
- It's a blessing for them, riding on the border!
The man who paid the office...
...here is a naive.
So what is it?
- Nothing, absolutely nothing.
- Does not that prevent us...
...to dinner?
- The end of history, notary!
- Where were you?
- When the old man...
"Your horse knows the way... "
- So you hear steps outside and someone knocks at the door.
This is not like me!
- Hotel Abbaye?
- Yes?
- Do you have a room?
- Is it just you?
I hope so... Close the door!
What do you with my hand?
Never had seen a stump?
- Why has the way?
- Interested?
- The road is cut.
- Are you sure?
Do not have suitcases?
- No, nothing more.
- Is that all?
- Where are the ruins?
- The hotel is down.
- What about the cemetery?
- No.
- No cemetery?
- No.
- Have you dug?
- Is the archaeologist, Sir?
No.
Have not you heard two shots now?
- No.
- Strange!
Do I look to shoot of be fired?
Fill in your registration, please.
A pen!
Do not touch that!
Cubriré la ficha, después me enseñará mi cuarto.
"Roland Brissot...
"35 years... "
Anything else?
- No, sir.
- "Artist"... That´s right!
- Duration of stay?
- A strange question! Do you know what will tomorrow? I do not!
Show me my room.
- Over here, sir!
- Curious guy!
- Perhaps a lunatic!
One did not want to find it only!
- Ladies, gentlemen! Have you seen a man...
...very strange, in black, carrying a large box?
He was shot down.
- If you were here!
- It is a traveler, but not corresponds to the description.
- A small one... man... in black?
- No distinction was made very well, appeared to have light behind.
- Met with him?
- No.
- Come on, Nick!
- Want a drink?
- No, the service... Even without the man, find the box.
Good night!
- Do you show your room?
Serve dinner.
I do not have time, I must go.
Where are the ruins?
- Go tomorrow, at day.
- Maybe for you.
I´m wait. Here and there!
- Ladies, gentlemen, if you want go to the table...
- I have no hunger!
- Strange!
It was not what he feared the dog! its close doors locked tonight!
- Again chickpeas?
- Did not lower?
You need to eat! "Primum vivere".
- How to paint with your hand?
- No, nor could the two!
- Clemence, making the chickpeas!
- Yeah, mom!
- An avalanche!
- A mad!
- And the chickpeas!
Lost night!
- Will you stay?
- As a trunk, lady!
- I sleep dressed!
- There he is!
- Will lost his hand in war?
- What's in that package?
- A memory of his wife?
- You have to keep looking drugs!
How about 1 kg. heroin?
- Mr. Brissot, call him by phone!
- Me?
- Yes, "Mr. Brissot".
But nobody knows that...
- I asked for you, with great courtesy.
Many courtesy!
Hello!
Hello?
Who is it?
What do you want?
Hello!
Again!
What?
- Watch out for the glasses!
- I cannot see, Mimí!
- The light!
- Clemence, where are you?
- Candles, Ms. Denis!
- Watch,
I choke with chickpeas!
- The light!
- The light!
Do not push!
Does it want to leave my nose?
- Clemence, do not be afraid!
- This is too much! If I plunder the one that is allowed...
... this gesture with my wife...
- I have a painful kick...
... in the butt.
- I got the crooked nose!
- What?
- I don´t know.
They skipped the leads, no doubt.
- Hello, hello!
- The fuses are intact!
Must be the Central.
And the phone?
Dead.
- It came from the Central?
- Hello?
Already phoned.
Come to Central!
- Yeah, and the kick...
... on my back too?
- I have stolen!
Who robbed me?
He had left there. Who did it?
- We have not seen anything!
- We were in the dark.
- After the shots...
- But, what happened?
Your box!
Has disappeared.
- It's essential to call the police!
- When we remain in the dark, the gentleman was in another place!
- Where are the fuse!
- Are intact.
- What if we said what containing that package?
It's so amazing!
- We're accustomed to notary stories!
- I can not.
- The police!
No, wait!
The police can not do anything.
Nobody can do anything for me.
Not a policeman.
- Not a colonel?
- I´m afraid not.
Well!
Listen up, gentlemen!
They will believe me if they want... judge it for you same!
Please... to the point! facts, dates! A date.
- Began... just over a year not long ago.
I feel that when I talk back to 20 years.
I had ideas, even too many!
It was painting the walls in my head!
It wanted to give life to the still lifes,
... capture the scent...
... of flowers, and vitamins food!
Of course, the dealers refuse politely...
... from their windows.
Then, ate and offered flowers to the models.
I had my ideas tended on the bed and we had...
... golden dreams.
I had specialized in studies of dogs... having the same issue as me.
Had gained some notoriety in Montparnasse.
Looked after my appearance, changed every day...
... shirt dirty, had hired an assistant... staff.
People see me in the middle of the street... but not because...
... my talent, but my clothes.
But I´m flattered.
One day, I entered a shop gloves.
There were many vendors.
- What are you, sir?
- I would... No.
What does, sir?
- I chose with this certainty that we are called "a chance".
Miss!
- What are you, sir?
- Gloves, white gloves.
But in a clear white, slightly green. With reflections:
What are some color!
- Why do I want?
- For a wedding.
- In that case, we have a...
... lot of good gloves to...
Sorry, just a minute!
- What is it? A great wedding at the Madeleine!
With Swiss guards, red carpet, candles... lots of lights!
After... it, the veil, almost floating and hands...
... full of flowers. And finally, the geometric line of courtship...
... and the family, all in a couple glove! Includes!
What would you do for me?
- In principle, I´m not married.
- Do you not believe in marriage?
- For me not.
Can I ask your hand?
- What?
- It is back!
- - Nice! Am I the person thousand number who said so?
- No, the first one.
- Thanks!!
I´m here since yesterday.
I'm glad I came today!
- I want to know your size, not its future!
- But I'm not the one who gets married!
- Seemed so convincing!
Is the godfather?
- No, I´m a painter.
I paint a wedding!
- With white gloves?
No, I will paint them!
- Yes!
- Let's see!
Not your size.
- I want to symbolize through a still life of what is alive...
... at the ceremony!
Every finger will animated
... as a character and be directly to the public eye.
Did you know?
- It's a great painter!
- You talk about me in Montparnasse.
- Also portraits?
Gladly make yours.
I started...
... his portrait... and to court.
But neither one thing nor the other progressed. Irene was... disappointing. And I was there, motionless, wondering at the same time...
... what were the colors for paint and gestures...
... or words to seduce.
This year will go to Saint Irene.
Finally!
- Too late?
One hour.
You just happened?
- No... Someone.
- Calm down, we are not saying more that unpleasant things.
Flowers,
But what happens?
- It's Saint Irene!
- Once again, it's lovely!
Why?
- It's a surprise.
What?
Gloves!
- Suede!
I will guard them!
- I had thought that...
- We have sold a lot old!
You can return them.
- It was symbolic.
- Yes, the Madeleine, the Swiss, loves, delights and organum!
- Everybody knows it!
- I speak very high?
Boss!
Boss! Come here, please!
Yes, sir?
What happens?
- It's inconceivable!
A rotten soup, stinking steak!
- Sulfur!
- A scorched sauce...
... and a garrison false!
- A curse, sir!
- Is that your excuse?
What do you think, sir?
- Sorry!
- Take it out!
Excuse me!
- Don´t want to marry me?
- Don´t ask me why.
- It would be my wife, my companion, my inspiration...
- You have many ideas!
- That no!
My dog has given me a extraordinary:
Paint life as seen by dogs.
An amazing view!
Later, I will paint the men seen by a horse, a swallow, an owl... a worm...
- The worms do not buy.
- I got money!
- Sure!
- Unique and valid, the glory!
- I asked...
... who thought of you, and do not know.
- Jealous.
- Do you? My poor friend!
- Could believe it.
- Who you calling...
... "always on the verge"?
- Envy.
- Roland, return home and have a look:
It would be a sensation, a gallery of mediocrity
... you would be the best!
- Oh, it's hard... You're right,
I have opened your eyes!
Until now it had scruples, but now I understand:
Tomorrow I will paint for you.
In three months, to the Salon!
A beautiful style.
- "¡The Salon...
"... Sleep in the room!
Too late. A month ago
"A painter, why not?
"He has talent, I´m ambition!"
How wrong!
- A few weeks!
Not always I will be a saleswoman!
- What do you want?
- If the lady and gentleman...
...they wanted to ask, one is late.
I have kid.
- In the form of a glove?
- No, fillet!
With purée.
The specialty of the day!
- A bad day!
- But the kid is good.
Do not have deer?
Well, I'm already served of venison!
Come on, say what they want!
You tell me!
- Also in life, let the others ask their menu:
Do not invite anyone to dinner! No gloves are available for him here.
- Who is he?
- Anyone!
Not offered nothing!
- Do not marry you!
- He was a man who knew what wanted! Also I!
- What?
- Living away from you!
Let go! Always will be a little painter...
... in a tiny workshop, always eat at small tables
... slept with small women in small beds...
... and ultimately his life in a small box! Bye,
... small!
- Free me of this!
Give me an order!
An order for 12! with soda!
This is an elegant home!
Prove this! Moderate the heart and refresh the ideas!
Can I sit?
- Whatever.
- Santa Madonna, Drink as if it was a water!
Cheers!
I don´t like to see my clients sad!
- Sad, not.
- The whole world it is,
... except me... I am very happy... too happy.
Well it seems not!
- Me? But this is happiness!
- What?
- The hapiness!
Have, you seem to be nice.
We sell.
- Very nice!
Cigarette?
- Thanks. I do...
... myself.
Wow!
With the left! I never knew rolling a cigarette.
- It is the talisman who does.
- A talisman rolling...
... cigarettes?
- Yes, sir.
A special talisman!
I had acquired skill, fortune, talent... women.
Everything! We sell.
His talisman that gives you everything and still want to sell?
I need to sell.
Why?
Because... if not sold before death,
I'll be damned.
Eternally doomed!
- Come, come!
- And all day after being in cookers,
... I have the taste of Hell!
- No joke!
If you were so good, nothing prevent sale!
Do you sell expensive?
- Of course not! ¡Few cents!
- Well, it is not expensive.
- Shop by cents, I can not...
... sell more than one because you can not sell...
... more than losing.
- It's fun!
- Look at him! We appeal to an artist like you!
- How do you know?
- The talisman, sir!
Come!
Come!
I'll show you the way.
- Do not buy it, sir!
Do not buy!
- Shut up!
Come, sir!
- Do not buy!
Do not buy!
- Who is this guy?
- A poor fool!
He believes the Guardian Angel of the world! Spend!
Over here! Excuse the mess!
Here it is!
- That is the talisman?
- His box, his coffin.
It´s inside.
Do not be afraid.
It will not damage to him.
It's a hand, his left hand.
In Latin, "sinistra manus".
Sinistra...
Take, sir, admire!
Close your fist!
Feel...
... fingers.
Hold, sir. Do not be fear!
- It's quite amazing!
- Buy and feel...
... a gift, a charm, a strong will hand over to his expert,
... more skilful, stronger!
- Do you believe?
- Why not? A button electrical and see clearly!
"A table
6 covered! "Why not?
Why not, sir?
- No need reports!
I cook my genius.
Of the customers who seem to doubt!
- When you take Hell,
It will not help you...
I have always thought that die... without having...
... sold. Then my soul will have all eternity!
- Come now!
- Now is my time...
... to sell... Few cents!
- Everyone on your site!
- The hand can be anything!
For a musician,
... is incomparable!
- And for painters?
- Take it and make even the
Mona Lisa beautiful!
... But no one is expensive.
- Think! The happiness, the success and fortune, love!
Buy, sir, buy!
- Do not buy!
Do not buy!
For a few cents!
- Agreed!
- Santa Madonna!
Jesus Christ, that heaven forgive me!
Do not you hide nothing!
Did you know?
- Lose a penny.
- Sell it before died or...
The hell?
- I do not believe in God or in the Devil!
- Shut up! If we hear!
- No time to lose!
Be, there is a few cents!
- Wait!
Give me your left hand,
"sinistra manus".
And with the other hand, give me those cents and say:
"I'll buy it."
- Mise en scene!
Say, say!
I'll buy it.
- What happened?
- The power has passed to you.
I knew it.
- Is he wrong?
Well, relieved. Be, take it!
- Listen... in all this is something...
Returns the box. All seems a joke.
A joke, my dead hand?
Too late, sir! Free!
Buy my hand? Do not talk!
Thanks, Santa Madonna! Now,
Go with your spells!
And never put your foot here!
¡"Vade retro, Satan"!
"Vade retro"!
Go, go!
What, Tim?
What's wrong?
Do not you know me?
¡He fled as if he had seen the same Devil!
Sir!
Mr. Brissot!
- Mr. Brissot,
What happens?
- What?
- I am.
I came to do the cleaning,
I found the door open.
"I have to wake up."
I was worried!
- I am not sick.
- It seems that last night
... put together much scandal moved the furniture, voices...
- ... dragged their feet...
- I don´t remember.
Smells like closed.
- Open the window.
- Let him!
Well!
Is not Mr. Brissot here?
Hello!
Hello.
But what happens?
- None. a man...
... came with a roll of sugar for you.
- For me?
- Police?
No, rather...
... an usher. We still are here, look!
Maybe a dealer!
The fortune arrives...
... hide!
I don´t know.
What is this box?
It´s for me?
- No.
- What is inside?
- Let go!
- How gross!
I've done wrong!
- Excuse me, is safe.
- Keep your secrets!
- 8 days ago, you were unable to do a package:
You...
... teasing me?
- Maybe.
Have you painted
... tonight?
- Me?
Yes!
Amazing!
Is a monastery?
- Now you see it!
In the Alps.
Appears.
You know the mountains?
- Never...
It's amazing.
Amazing!
What a night of fright!
- I do not believe in the sweetness of Moonlight.
And this shadow behind the pillar,
... what is it?
- I don´t know.
- Do not know what you wanted represent?
Why, what is it?
- Looks like the Pont-Neuf.
- The same night.
- The same monnlight.
- What is this man?
And the knife?
Blood.
- Again the same shadow after him!
Enough!
- But it's very good!
Was right to force you...
... to work. Kiss my!
- Do not work for you!
- What are you? I'm right to be proud!
Take her to Gibelin!
- Gibelin never bought me anything.
- Signature, I care!
Do not do anything else.
Men do not know how to move!
You paint with the left side?
Are you left handed?
- It´s an old habit.
Tell me, Irene...
Being convicted... mean anything to you?
- What? I was fixing.
What say?
Nothing.
Have you finished?
How have you signed?
"Maximus Leo?
Why Maximus Leo?
- Do not know!
Signed well, without thinking.
Curious nickname!
- Skin is not yet dry.
- Let me.
I think you're becoming very mischievous!
You can sleep peacefully.
You will...
... to pay for this!
"The clear moon the shadow and the knife."
It is not my hand.
Irene!
My box!
- Please excuse! Was distracted.
Sorry.
Take.
Take one of my brochures.
A council is good, and two better than one! All right!
Every man is in his hand.
The man is in those of God.
This is the hand of Alexander,
Hannibal, Napoleon.
If you take it! The hand of
Pasteur, that the murderer...
Franzini......
- And those?
- Those are but one, Romeo and Juliet.
The past, present, future eternity? 40F, that's all.
The past.
- Does the memory so weak?
- My hand lived a life so long!
Give me.
Get out!
Get out!
Never again here!
- Are you satisfied? The output is around here, please!
- We have been impressed, eh!
- Is a small Brissot?
Now, we will go or not!
- Hey! ¡Grangier, come! The Prince of criticism!
- Miss!
- What do you think of that?
Oh, damn!
"Maximus Leo? Do not know!

Bring it.

Irene.
You staying here.
- Yes
- Work on your portrait tonight.
Yes
And never left me.
Whatever happens.
No.
- The weeks passed so fast we thought that counts...
... A year later,
... the same day, was inaugurated in the Gibelin´s gallery...
... the first exhibition of young painter Maximus Leo.
It was a beautiful presentation.
Had great personalities.
... members of the
Poets Fatigued Institute,
... women of the world...Everything
Paris worldly... and idle.
And also many people who had come to the buffet.
- The hieroglyphics of poetry...
- Yes.. Sorry!
Hurra for Mr. Gibelin!
It works, it works!
- I was the first to believe in you, in understanding that succeed!
- Are you happy?
- Very.

"You will be my wife, my partner, my inspiration. "
Thanks to me, you are who you are!
- But what am I?
- Listen,
I tell them.
- comes from the depth!
- Surreal Horizons!
- A composition of all...
- Suddenly, an elderly woman...
"Everything to the left!"
- I've been very clumsy!
- You fool, Gibelin has reason!
How are you, lovers,

- A little thanks to me, right?
- You, me, us!
Grangier, come!

- Congratulations! Spirituality...
- Too nice!
And my exposition?
- A success.

- There is a presence of past...
- 50,000! The musketeer?
- It seeks the dramatic...
- Alone?
- Very little.
- Sir!
Uncorked with a lot of noise!
- I´m ashamed to see me naked before them.
- Completely naked?
- Yes, in paint!
- Bravo, bravo! Charming!
- It's the most beautiful gift to me could at my party!
Will there be others?
- Mystery!
- Where are they?
- Nothing in my hands,
... nothing in their pockets!
Tonight, both at home
... windows and curtains closed...
- To your health, Madame!
- Thanks!
- Thanks, Gibelin!
Ah, it is improvised, to the health of Irene: his father was not king, it was of Suresnes, the mother of Charleroi.
But his soul is my queen and her body is my king.
It is not pretentious, but it is nice!
Do not seem to understand! Yes?
- Look, man! Go to that man there!
When this kind of provincial notary interest...
... for the painting which means nothing,
... it's glory.
Now you know!
Let me a moment!
- Bravo, darling!
- Congratulations!
- Sorry!
- The cocktail in Cocteau!
- What is this?
- An order, sir.
- Who has done?
- A small black gentleman.
"Deliver the
Church of St. Irene. "
Curious, was just...
- Yes, I know.
Want something sir?
- No, goodbye!
- At your service!
- I don´t know where it went. Not at home?
There it is!
I called you.
You've searched everywhere very worried! Where were you?
- I don´t know.
- How? Gibelin is furious.
- I went. Do not stand the people you do not know...
... that the painting is speaking!
- Now that you succeed...
- Oh, success!
- For what you've struggled.
- Irene!
- Yes?
- We must leave.
- Go?
- Yes
To be leaving. Go,
I don´t know,...
Go anywhere!
- To anywhere?
- Do you love me, are you happy?
- Hug me!
Yes.
- Could you abandon all this,
... to Paris, the luxury?
- Have you done something wrong?
- No.
- Are we poor now?
- No, we are rich, but to leave.
- Where you want!
- Thanks. Go tonight.
- Tonight? But, my surprise, the party promised?
It will be later. Get ready!
If I change, will not.
- Be brave.
- Why?
- What?
- One man is waiting...
... in the office.
- It's crazy!
Maybe!
I apologize.
Wanted to know both.
- Me too!
Enjoy your party!
- What do you want? Why me spied upon, guarded?
- Debtor's curious language to lender
- I owe you something?
- Nothing... Your soul!
I have also come to know,
... as a farmer looks at his harvest.
So you are...
- Not always the devil is with a poor man!
It's impossible!
- But anything is possible. Today a year ago that you...
... bought the hand. Then
I guess...
... that his soul will be mine again after his death.
Who is richer for its debts, and who says no word, consent.
- But it is not possible!
To begin:
Do not sell what is not know! you can not sell what does not exist!
- Are you a lawyer?
- Men have always...
... sought to deceive!
Few cents:
You will not find anything better.
- Cents.
- Not worth anything.
Enjoy've found a tiny silver lining for this part...
... of himself in which not believe.
Just now, no.
It's a moment, he did not believe in you!
And it´s here!
- Even a little closer!
- Well...
Life is short.
And the condemnation is eternal.
More worth having to search!
Happiness on earth is important.
- But eternity!
- I get in trouble.
Want to buy again his soul?
- What pricing?
- No, I´m a good devil!
- How much?
- A few cents.
- That's right!
- Beware!
I returned the hand and forfeit valuable benefits.
He is a man of fortune,
... lover of a woman, but tomorrow... again be a failure.
Obviously, I need to think about.
Well, take your time, thinks about this.
I'm just a philanthropist.
We will...
... a flea market, today few cents, and twice tomorrow... continue... 8 cents, 16,
... 1024, in effect, to infinity.
You know what that is...
... infinity? I do,
I've been there. It is very nice.
That's right!
- Is the hand inside?
- Do?
Create teasing me!
Yeah, okay.
- So...
I ask.
- No, not yet.
Your soul is worth a mediocre life and broken?
Sorry!
I thought you were finished!
- introduce me, please.
- An old family friend,
... My wife!
- It's lovely!
My most sincere greetings!
- You have seen a year ago.
- I beg you!
- What?
Let me calm!
Want to return your chest?
Calm down, lady,
... now I'm going, let here with your happiness!
But, let me make this contribution to his party.
- It's not for me, is impossible!
Oh, a black diamond!
I beg you.
And that package?
You do not know a package?
- For the love of God, let me free!
What?
No!
Whatever.
Poor!
I refused.
- Goodbye, sir, and thank again! Roland, do not you stay...
... like a soul in pain!
Thank you very much!
- It's nothing, ma'am, all stays here, see you soon!
Look!
Give it! Take the fright.
- You're crazy!
- I do not want.
Are you jealous?
Irene!
Say you believe in me, love me!
What would you ask?
- Want to kiss you?
- Do not continue like this.
Listen to me!
My hand...
The hand you caressed, painting... was not my hand, I was not, was a gift, a talisman.
It is the hand of the box.
- It is not possible, you drunk!
- Champagne.
- Fantastic Birthday!
- So what is returned?
- Yes!
You're right.
She is a lovely woman!
A beautiful sinner!
If I give in exchange for...
... and leave him forever.
Would you like me to break the head?
Do not forget, will be doubled!
- For how many days?
- 3 weeks, Doctor.
He began the night of my birthday.
I´m so worried.
- What events?
- Fixed Ideas. Money.
Throughout the day is doing accounts.
Erase the days with crosses.
- Deadlines!
- Do not think so! Closes locked in your room: for 3 weeks, makes life separately. And talk alone.
They bend!
- Yesterday he accused me of be because of bad luck.
He wanted to strangle her.
- Strangle?
- Yes, doctor. Then apologized, but I am so afraid...
... do that again...
- Let's see!
- You're so excited!
- Calm down!
- No! No pass!
Let me calm!
What do you want?
- Good evening, Mr. Brissot!
His wife worries about his health...
- We have come for me!
She thinks I'm crazy.
Not my body or my brain what is in danger, but my soul,
... Do you understand?
And I'm not crazy!
Did you sense my presence?
I expected.
So... Have you thought?
Yes!
- Has made a decision?
- Yes!
You can take your talisman!
- Do you need?
And his paintings?
Does the glory?
- I know...
... to all the dealers;
Now that I have name...
- And is not afraid to lose their woman?
- My wife... Unfortunately,
I lost every day.
I am afraid. Selling your soul without keep your body?
Who's there?
- Are you coming to dinner?
- No. I am not hungry.
I...
... do you need?
- No!
- As you want...
So you have money?
Yes, I got it.
- Is the twenty-third day today,
Really?
Let's count.
How long?
And 20 cents.
- I'll do a check.
- No.
Today is Saturday. At this time the
Banks are closed.
- I had planned, I cash.
Someone has opened the safe!
Missing 20,000 francs!
It is not possible!
Irene!
Where is the money?
- What money?
- Lack 20.000 F.
- I picked up.
- Have you been yourself?
- For my coat.
- Do not you understand?
- You're crazy!
- Stop it, you hurt me, the money is there!
- How?
- Yes,
... is in the the cabinet.
- How much left?
Saved.
I got the money!
Wait!
That's right!
Missing 8.20 F!
How do you know?
It is my job.
The girl!
Sorry!
A moment?
It's impossible!
And now!
zero hours, zero minutes...
40 seconds. </ i>
- Time seems short in my company! But, beware,
... not only that 209,715.20
I should, but they are 419,430.40!
See you tomorrow!
Do not forget!
They bend!
¡400.000F., 400.000F.!
I repeated it in the street.
Looking in the phone book, calling...
... friends who never were.
Without friends,...
- The sir is not!
- No, sir!
800.000F! 800.000F! 800.000F!
The amount grows forever, relentlessly, mathematically!
Maddened by the quantity,
... try their luck in the
Lottery, no luck.
Only lack Melisse, the chef
I had sold the talisman.
All doors closed eyes... also closed!
One day, let me lead of despair... When...
Hello!
Who?
Irene?
- Yes, I am Sure you needed money,
... you're looking everywhere,
I got it for you. Yes, very much!
Do not ask me how! Hello?
There's someone on the line!
¡Withdraw, sir! Say,
Can you hear me? A lot of money.
I returned to my old room at the hotel...
... Poirier, room mumber 23.
You hear me?
- Yes, ma'am, strangled!
You can count on the fingers.
He was so young!
- Have you been arrested?
What a thought!
- The room is upside down!
- Do not go, sir!
The police are in the house.
- Cannes, Nice,
Monte Carlo:
"Winter Passing in the French Riviera. "
Huh?
- It's in the newspaper.
- It's advertising!
No, it's a advice.
Good advice should be followed.
Go to Monte Carlo, stay in the
Nice in the hotel...
... Palmier, ask for
Mr. Verdure, the boss, of me.
It has a tip for roulette!
They teach you!
It's your last chance!
Who are you?
- Can not remember the dishwasher from Melissa´s...
... a little over a year?
My name is Angel.
Do you remember?
Ángel!
- I also lost the trick and when
I arrived...
... to Monte Carlo, was
6,510,886.40F!
Do game!
We are at game!
"Rien ne va plus"!
Black, 17 odd and lack!
Earned!
¡The chips, quantities...
... are crowded in front!
The people approached my table,
... believe that...
... brought luck! I would awaken from this nightmare!
When a woman at my table...
- What makes a sudden cold!
We are at stake!
"Rien ne va plus"!
Was not anything else, indeed.
Now the game was done!
And I lost every penny... no mercy of these... gardeners in smoking!
I left the salon...
... as a spectrum. A dealer believed it was..
... to kill myself.
Calm as I have no mood to kill myself!
Are you a dealer?
- Yes, we have been given...
... you need to return home. Where are staying?
- ... In Nice,
Palmier hotel.
- An elegant residence!
- Do you believe, in full carnival?
But do not...
... in time for the games and laughter? Go to Nice.
Find...
... To a nice person who will not be too reasonable.
- I do not dare!
- Losing money is not...
... fatal. Believe me!
- What can I do?
We men are united!
United in a chain mysterious:
A link!
A chain!
It's strange to say that word!
I too am part of a chain, limited to some men.
But... if they were happy, would benefit from advantages...
... beyond the human, and I, finally link, would have to pay.
Is it fair, God damn?
- Do not blaspheme!
Get back to your site from the masks!
- Has won sir?
- No.
- Have you lost much?
- Everything.
Your key. Paid in advance...
... a week.
Sir!
Do not make any silly?
That is not tolerated here.
- Don´t worry, even
I have the right to die.
- Go to the hall, some costumes very amazing!
- Hey, Roland Brissot!
We complete the knights...
... and I, all old possessor of a talisman.
- We, links of chain.
- Joined as the fingers of a hand.
- We have been invoked, we responded.
A coup? I'm ready!
- Your servers, me and my invincible sword!
It was a musketeer of the King.
It was the eve of a duel in which I exceeded cowardice
... That I bought in the house of an apprentice...
... of alchimist that damn talisman. From there I went...
... invincible, hand worked for me, had no rival...
... I win!
To date, unfortunately,
In that I left myself to provoke and killed my best friend.
Then I rid the hand through a beggar... that roam the Pont-Neuf.
This was the beggar.
Thanks to the hand, I became the biggest thief and liar...
... of my time. Collect an immense fortune, but not...
What I liked was possess, steal,
... minted coin.
My reputation of...
... thief was increasing, until
His Majesty trusts me your finances.
Until the day that the people was tired and I paid with my life...
But I had time of shaking hands to...
... a juggler.
- And I became the biggest...
... juggling...
... of my time. I always had liked the balance.
Surrounded by a mysterious power, quickly became the biggest... juggling... And the kings were fighting for meeting.
One day,
... in the Spanish court, asking me you play with eggs.
Suddenly, I do not know that momentum is crazy gripped me.
I hung up after climb to the throne.
But before, I had time to deliver the hand......
It was me who bought it.
And I became the largest magician of my time.
Called the Spectrum, did speak to the tables,
... sleeping a public stunned.
One day, I slept the daughter of a prince, but could not wake her.
The prince made me cut my head.
But before the execution, a surgeon wanted to buy...
... the body.
I sold him my hand.
I was this surgeon.
The poor bodies that had suffered a lifetime...
... till death were mine...
... an admirable field of experiences. Thanks to me,
...the surgery progressed towards new operations.
Unfortunately, one day, I succumbed before the longing and desire for...
... the woman he loved.
So I killed myself.
I sold the hand by a few cents to my young lab assistant.
I was that young assistant.
Were the principles of boxing.
In the Fair of the Throne, was surprised...
... the curious. My manager,
... that was not a philanthropist, he taught me with force and a good...
... advertising, it could win big money. I teach...
... the rudiments of boxing, to breathe, the set of legs...
... that would ensure victory.
So come to fight, the major battles in the light...
... of the reflectors with screams of madness, glory.
World Champion!
But not for long, alas!
I became blind, in a battle, knock...
... the referee.
That was misery. But, I needed live. For a long time...
... I sold vegetables in a small van. He sold...
... the hand of a cook.
Santa Madonna!
Mélisse!
Soon, hand saved me.
In a contest of great cooks,
I won...
... the gold medal that shone as a casserole, and my business...
... was famous. But the fear of the condemnation was tormenting me.
Fortunately, a night, an poor guy, a painter...
... who suffered for love.
I´m this poor guy...
... and strive to buy my soul.
Tonight I have over 6 million.
And it is almost midnight.
- We are here to help as what can each:
We will not find rest...
- While you continue this hand...
... condemning!
- But each day is doubled!
- We must win redemption of his soul.
- A musketeer?
- A magician?
- A juggler?
- Even a world champion?
- A cook?
- I'm here!
Greetings, the beggar´s era!
Armed robbery, scam, robbed, blackmail, crime...
... black market!
Let me!
Print the money.
- Come on,
I'll teach my office?
Would I be content with such a trifle?
Me, Evil?
Create in me, Roland Brissot, resigns! Her time has come.
- Hey, Mr. Devil, not so fast!
My alchemist!
- I can not hide anything!
To the owner of the hand!
- But, I...
- Where there is the one that has taken
... advantage?
- I know who he is.
Signed my pictures as "Maximus Leo".
How?
Maximus Leo!
- Glory to the Almighty and
Peace on Earth!
I was born the year of grace 1422, son of a woodcutter in the Alps,
Maxime... the Lion.
The monks
Saint-Bruno picked me...
... and I was very young
Abbey in the Allevard, in the...
... Dauphiné, named
Maximus Leo. God gave to...
... my left hand on a power.
- He could make you...
... the best man of your time!
But I left on the mountain.
And it ascended!
- Throughout my life, a little man in black around me... to tempt me and to buy my power.
But this hand is...
... together with the other united in prayer.
Then he returned to me in the silence of the tomb.
I cut the hands and a steal!
- Devil! And to me
I sold it!
Thief!
- Ungrateful, you do not serve for...
Thief!
- Ungrateful, you do not serve for...
... to please shy, beggars and unsatisfied?
- With the price of your soul!
- No. What everyone...
... has treated with him he was lacking value! He has not...
... sold anything, the devil himself could not sell anything...
... that does not belong!
And that He knows!
- Thief!
- Thief!
I'm saved!
I´m saved.
- Your soul is saved.
- So, sorry and takes your hand.
- No. Let her follow destination up to me!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
- Roland Brissot, you're the only one alive in our circle of shade.
We are but appearances.
My soul excuses you, but my body remains a disabled person.
His hand on his return tomb in the Dauphiné.
The last link in the chain has your turn, will be free!
- I was only in the morning.
On the table, seven empty plates,
... mouth vessels were up, moved the chairs...
... as if many people had passed this way.
And instead of my left hand was only a stump,
... a pain stabbing in the arm.
On the ground, where he had seen the monk, picked up the hand...
... fossil and dissected, that had been theirs.
I put it solemnly in the shelter.
Then I looked at the mountains the tomb of the monk...
... Maximus Leo returns to his mortal bed...
... and grant eternal rest.
- And here is the chest that you have stolen just now!
- And around us, a world invisible!
- Finally, is the same,
We do not make believe,
... in the twentieth century...
Denis, What do you think?
- In the mountains we do not see the things so simple!
- And you, colonel?
- It's suspicious and is not very clear,
... your story!
Because his soul has escaped...
... of that threat, should be relaxed.
- Gentlemen, I´m the only living being has dealt with the little man!
And he does not forgive those who have offended!
My soul is free, but not my life!
It´s not my body! Prosecute me!
It will kill me since as killed Irene!
Remember what we said the man's coffin,
... he is. It's there!
- Let's go!
- Do not open, do not open!
- It's the wind, the branches...
...of the fir!
- Do not go!
- Auguste!
- There´s so much hell like fire in my hands!
There´s something in the door.
The imprint of a hand!
How could he do that?
- That's right! There! That's right!
He flees.
You've seen something!
- I felt a warm in my legs!
- It was the devil himself!
- Come on?
Do not have a clear conscience!
There it is!
Run!
- Who are you?
- With a little man.
Fight!
- What?
- God!
- Come on!
- Come!
- I stay here,
I do not see it!
Is he dead?
Dead.
Skull fracture!
- Poor guy!
- Did you know?
He's dead, the unlucky!
Here's the box!
Is empty.
- Look!
It is a tomb.
Bring your lantern, Denis!
"Maximus...
"Leo."
- It's the tomb of the monk!
The circle is closed.
The last link in the chain is now the first.
Good evening, Doctor.
Doctor?
Yes.
Dr. Hohner.
The theater physician.
He lives just around the corner. What's he doin' around here this time of night?
Uh, somebody sick?
Yes. He is.
Marcellina.
Marcellina.
Oh, yes.
Uh, did the police ever find her?
No.
After 10 years, they've given up trying.
Marcellina, it has come.
At last, it has come.
What, Luise?
I couldn't wait. I opened it.
The king invites you— no, commands you to sing for him.
Luise, I'm going to faint.
Not now, my sweet.
After you sing for the king, you can faint all you like.
Will you find the maestro?
I want him to hear the good news.
This is the biggest moment of my life.
#Ah, we bid you welcome to this fete #
#Ah, we're sorry if we made you wait #
#Ah, let violins begin the dance #
#Ah, let there be joy and gay romancing #
#Ah, tell me why this doubt #
# Should fall to me #
#Whose tragic power seems to call to me ##
Friedrich, I asked you never to come here again.
I had to see you.
Well, I don't want to see you.
I thought you understood that.
But I love you, Marcellina.
No, Friedrich. You love your own private, selfish world.
You want to lock me up there with you, give up my career.
That's what you've got to do.
I can't bear the thought that any man can hear you sing for him, feast his eyes on you... just for the price of a ticket.
I worked hard for my success,
Friedrich.
Tonight, there were 11 solo curtain calls.
More than any other singer's ever had in this theater.
The king commands me to sing for him.
Why, I'd be a fool to give that up for you. Darling, listen to me.
No, Friedrich. I've listened to you for the last time. Now please go.
This isn't really you speaking,
Marcellina.
You've forgotten how happy we've been and will be again.
Now let me hear you say once more, just as you used to,
"I love you, Friedrich. "
I can't say it... because I don't love you.
I hate you.
I don't hate you.
I only hate the thing that's come between us—your voice.
Yes, I know.
You were out front tonight.
I felt your eyes on me.
Like you're looking at me now.
Go away.
Get out of here!
I'm afraid of you.
You needn't be.
I love you, my darling.
You know that.
I'd give my life for you.
This thing that shuts me out—
I won't let it.
I tell you I won't let it.
It's here, now, between my fingers.
I've only to close them to silence it forever.
Friedrich, you're hurting me.
Friedrich, you're—
We'll always be together now.
Your voice will never come between us again.
Marcellina.
Dr. Hohner, are you all right?
Yes. Yes.
I'm all right.
Good morning, Count Seebruck.
Good morning.
Good morning, Count
Seebruck. Good morning.
Good morning, Count
Seebruck. Good morning.
Good morning. Good morning, Jean.
Good morning, Count Seebruck.
What a lovely morning.
The air is like wine.
Chestnut trees are in bloom.
All nature is in harmony.
Well, even our friends the critics have been kind to us this morning.
Oh, it's good to be alive.
Everything is serene, peaceful, quiet.
- I have never been so insulted in all my life.!
I positively will not stand for it.
I am the prima donna of the Royal Theatre, not a barmaid in a cheap beer hall.
And I won't be insulted by—
I was not insulting you.
I was merely trying to show you—
You show me.
Why, the insolence.! Now, children, children. Please. Please. What's wrong?
Stop it! Stop it!
Now, you, Brunn. What is it? And stop bobbing.
Yes, madame.
Uh, Count Seebruck, if you please.
We were just rehearsing the duet between
MadameJarmila and Signor Roselli...
when for no apparent reason,
MadameJarmila— For no apparent reason?
Why, this—This creature here was handling me like a pan of unbaked dough.
I was not. I merely put my arm around your waist.
- Carl, you were in the prompter's box. You saw it all.
- I'm sorry.
You know how it goes,
Count Seebruck.
# I love you
La-la-la-la, la-la-la #
Will you take your hands off my stomach!
Perhaps you'd rather I didn't touch you at all. Nothing would please me better.
For 20 years, the baritone embraces the prima donna at that particular moment.
- Now she's trying to tell—
- I defy anyone to sing in one of your deathlike grips.
My dear, if you are unable to sing,
I refuse to take the blame.
Unable to sing? Just what do you mean by that insult?
Oh, stop it. Stop it.
Roselli, you're as temperamental as a prima donna.
And as for you, Jarmila, I'm getting a little bit tired of your constant bickering.
So am I, Count Seebruck.
And if you, as the impresario of this theater, don't do something about it, I shall.
All right.
Is madame's understudy ready?
Yes, Count Seebruck.
Miss Metzger, please.
Miss Metzger.
Yes, Count Seebruck.
Come in, my dear.
- Do you know the soprano role?
- Oh, yes, sir.
You shall sing it tonight in MadameJarmila's stead.
Tonight? Oh!
Oh.
If some composer would only write me an operetta without any women, I'd make him immortal.
Count Seebruck.! Count Seebruck.!
Count Seebruck.! Well, what is it?
There's a— There's a— Well?
There's a dead man in one of the dressing rooms.
A dead man?
In which room?
T- Twenty-two.
But, Jarmila, darling.
Oh, it's you, Dr. Hohner.
I must have fallen asleep.
Thank you. Brunn, continue with the rehearsal.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Yes, sir.
On stage, please.
Are you all right now? That was silly of me to fall asleep in the dressing room.
Oh, I understand.
Carl, get some black coffee and bring it to my office.
And as a doctor, you must realize that this constant brooding over Marcellina is bad for you.
You've had a brilliant career.
Your clientele is most distinguished.
But you must put this tragedy out of your mind.
- #Ah, tell me why this doubt #
- Who is that singing?
- You hear it too?
- #Should fall to me #
# Whose tragic power #
# Seems to call to me ##
Who are you?
Who are you? She's Angela Klatt, a music student. We are both students.
Do you know what you were singing?
Of course. It's from The Magic Voice.
That music is sacred.
Sacred?
Sacred to the memory of Marcellina.
No one must ever sing it again.
Do you hear?
No one.
Hohner.
And now may I ask what you're doing in my music library?
Count Seebruck, forgive me, please.
I am altogether to blame.
You know these young people?
My nephew, Franz Munzer.
And this is Angela Klatt.
I've been smuggling them in here to study these old scores.
I shouldn't have done it without your permission.
It's quite all right, Carl.
There's no harm been done.
But Dr. Hohner.
I met him in the corridor.
Yes. Why was he so angry with me?
He was in love with Marcellina.
Ten years ago, she disappeared.
But I still don't see why.
You know, it's a strange thing, my dear, but as I came down the corridor, I thought I heard Marcellina singing in here.
The doctor was convinced of it.
You mean my voice is anything like hers?
It's far more beautiful.
Did you ever hear Marcellina?
No. She was before my time, but there's never been anything like Angela's voice. It's the most beautiful voice in the world.
They are engaged to be married.
He could be right, you know.
How long have you been studying?
Eight years.
At the conservatory.
Franz is going to be a great composer.
Indeed.
They have heard every performance in the theater for the past three years.
They have season tickets, eh?
I smuggled them under the prompter's box.
Incorrigible.
- There's an aria in the second act of The Boulevardier.
- "Someday I Know. "
# Someday #
# I know #
# My heart will know #
#The thrill of love #
# Supreme #
#And so until #
#I know that thrill #
# I'll dream #
#And gladly wait #
# For him whom fate #
#Has said will be #
#For me #
# In some great plan #
# Since time began #
#To be #
How are you to find him?
Where are you to go?
Will you recognize him?
How are you to know?
# Our eyes will meet #
# Our lips will speak #
#Across some crowded hall #
What's the matter, dear?
Stifling in here. Don't you think?
- Not for baritones.
- # I'll touch his hand ##
Ah. Jarmila, Roselli.
Come in. Come in.
MadameJarmila, Signor Roselli.
Miss Angela Klatt. Mr. —
Munzer. Franz Munzer.
I'm sorry you didn't hear Miss
Klatt sing. Ah, but we did hear.
May I congratulate you?
Thank you, signor.
And MadameJarmila is just as enthusiastic as I am.
I am indeed.
You show promise, my dear.
Great promise. Your voice is lovely, but don't force it.
Today, it would be a folly to give it to the public.
Believe me. Don't you agree with me, Seebruck?
I do, Jarmila. As you say, today, Miss Klatt is not ready.
Not nearly ready.
But next week, Thursday,
I will present her in The Boulevardier.
And please don't faint— either of you.
Mama Hinzl.
Yes.
What have you got there?
Angela's supper.
Nightingales must have something solid to eat if they are to sing.
Solid is right. Fat sausages, buttered buns and rich chocolate.
Take it away. You mean you are going to let her go to the theater without eating?
That's no good for Angela.
It'll only make her fat.
Suppose it does. Whoever heard of a good prima donna who wasn't fat?
"Soprano" and "fat" are one and the same thing. Look at me.
Get her lemon juice and honey.
Lemon juice.
Come in.
Angela, are you ready? Yes.
Where's my muff? My muff.
Angela, don't be nervous now.
I'm not nervous. I feel fine.
You must be. I can't blame you for it. You've been working so hard, and you're excited.
I'm not excited. Good. I'm not either. I'm as calm as can be. There's one thing I must impress on you.
When you cross in the beginning of the number—
When you cross to the girls— Cross. Yeah.
You get the mirror from the girls and go over and hold it in front of you— Yeah, yeah.
Please, Angela. Hold the mirror low. We want to see your face. Yeah. The mirror.
Oh, Franz.
Oh, Angela.
Oh, you're going to be wonderful, and I'll be very proud.
Angela, Franz.
The carriage is here.
Coming.
Carl, a carriage?
Such extravagance.
Certainly. Whoever heard of a prima donna walking to the theater?
Here you are, my little thrush.
Lemon juice and honey. Drink it all.
Of course, I wouldn't put this mess in my stomach, but the maestro knows best.
Come, come, children. You can't be late, Angela. This is an event.
Good luck, darling.
Good-bye. Bye, Mama.!
Lemon juice.
Excuse me. I'm s-sorry.
Oh. Sorry.
Angela Klatt.
The greatest voice in the world.
Quiet.
All right, girls. All right.
Places, please.
Thank you. Thank you.
Jill. Jill. J—

Miss Klatt alone, please.
Bravo.!
Good-bye, my dearJarmila.
Oh, are you going away?
No, but you are.
What do you think?
Count Seebruck, I don't think. I know.
A new star is born. It's unbelievable. Her voice—
I could close my eyes and swear it's Marcellina.
You must feel it too.
I'm seriously thinking of reviving The
Magic Voice for her. Wonderful. Wonderful.
Come to the office tomorrow. I need to talk to you about something.
Meanwhile, tonight—
Franz. She was magnificent.
Weren't you nervous, excited?
Both. I ate my program.
Oh, Leon, I forgot to buy her a present. Oh.
- Ajeweler open till midnight?
- Yes. He sells gifts to the men while they wait for their sweethearts to come out.
Then, next day, he buys them back from the girls at one-half.
Each piece he sells over and over. Well, he won't sell my present over again.
Oh. Is he expensive?
Very.
But men in love don't question prices.
That's right, Leon.
I beg your pardon.
But you're Miss Klatt, aren't you?
Yes.
I'm Dr. Hohner.
Oh, yes, Doctor. I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you.
It's a rule of the theater to have your throat examined after each performance.
Now, if you don't mind, my office is just around the corner.
I'm sorry, but— but I'm waiting for Franz. Franz Munzer, my fiancé.
He should be waiting for you.
But if I'm not here—
He'll wait.
But, Doctor, I—
I'm sorry, my dear, but Count
Seebruck expects the report tonight.
I won't keep you a moment.
You know,
I heard you sing tonight.
I haven't heard a voice like that in 10 years.
Thank you, Doctor. You have a great career ahead of you, my dear.
I hadn't thought a throat examination would be necessary after the performance.
It's a rule of the Royal Theatre. You are part of that theater now, my dear, and you must obey its rules.
From now on, your music must come before everything.
But what about Franz? Oh, Franz, of course. But that will come later.
It's hard to believe that it's 10 years since
I brought Marcellina here after a great triumph.
Ah, Luise.
This is Miss Klatt.
How do you do, Luise?
Is that Marcellina?
Yes. Perhaps I shouldn't say it— and I don't say it boastfully— but Count Seebruck told me that my voice reminded him of hers.
It's true. That's why I behaved so rudely that morning in the library.
I was certain it was Marcellina's voice come back to life again.
That's a wonderful compliment,
Doctor.
You knew her very well, didn't you?
No one knew her better.
Now will you come with me?
Excuse me.
Don't mind Luise.
She was Marcellina's maid and companion.
She worshipped her. And as a reward for her devotion, I brought her here to keep house for me.
You're handy to the theater, aren't you? I have to be.
You songbirds are my official responsibility.
And if I'm too busy to get away, I can still hear the opera through these ventilators.
It's like a private performance, isn't it?
Oh, this is lovely.
That's Marcellina as Isolde.
She sang it beautifully.
She must be very real to you, Doctor.
Yes. Let me show you.
I have souvenirs here of every role she ever sang.
What do you think became of Marcellina, Doctor?
That is a mystery that has never been solved.
She used this fan in Romeo and Juliet.
And this slipper is one of a pair she wore in Mozart's Nozze di Figaro.
Oh.
What tiny feet she must have had.
Like a child.
That's true. A child.
What exquisite pearls.
She always wore them in The Magic Voice.
She had them on the night she disappeared.
How would you like to wear them when you sing The Magic Voice?
I? Perhaps I'm talking out of turn.
Seebruck told me tonight he plans on reviving it with you.
Oh. Oh, I can't believe it.
Shall we try them on for luck?
She always wound them around her throat.
Like this.
Her slender, graceful throat.
Exquisite to the touch.
- I shouldn't keep Franz waiting so long.
- I'm sorry.
I forgot all about him. Now let's take a look at your throat.
I won't keep you another moment.
You'll be coming here regularly, you know.
From now on, I'm responsible for your physical welfare.
Oh, just sit down there, my dear.
Then you're not going to operate on me? Of course not.
Well, all these things are rather frightening.
I know exactly what you mean. I feel the same way when I go to the dentist's.
Now then.
If you'll remove your hat... and loosen your cape.
Now then. Sit back in the chair and be comfortable.
This is only a routine examination.
It won't take long.
The light.
We're ready.
Now watch the light.
No, no. Watch it.
I— I can't. It hurts my eyes.
It'll only be for a minute.
I want to relax you before I examine your throat.
You don't mind it now, do you?
Rest, my dear.
Restore those tired and broken nerves.
Drive out all fear and weariness.
Chase away the shadows and forms...
that exhaust our emotions and enfeeble us.
That's better.
You're relaxing now.
Body, muscles, nerves, brain.
You're gliding away into pleasant places.
You don't resist anymore.
Gently slipping into another world— a world of my design where you will be helpless without me.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Yes.
I hear you, Doctor.
You don't want to sing again. Ever.
Tonight, you give your voice and your will to me.
I'm in control.
Your voice will no longer answer your brain.
It will obey mine instead.
Look at the mirror.
Keep looking at it.
You will never try to sing again.
Say it.
I—
I will never try to sing again.
That voice was never yours.
It belongs to Marcellina, but it's leaving you.
I'm sending it back to her.
It must be silenced forever.
I forbid you to sing again.
My—
My throat.
I'll take care of that.
You will take this atomizer with you and never be without it.
It will remind you of my control.
Shall we get up now?
I— I must have fallen asleep.
Just what I wanted.
And my throat?
Perfect.
I don't think it's going to give us a bit of trouble.
Can I help you, Doctor?
Yes, Luise.
Send Miss Klatt home in the carriage.
#Ah, tell me why this doubt should fall to me #
# Whose tragic—#
#Ah, tell me why this doubt should—#
#Ah—#
#Ah, tell me why this doubt should fall to me #
#Ah, tell me why this doubt #
#Should fall to me #
# Whose tragic power #

#Ah ##
Marcellina, it's come back.
That voice—That voice to take you away from me.
But I won't let it.
I won't let it.
How can you sit there when we don't even know what's happened to her?
We know what happened.
She made a great success.
That is no reason to disappear into thin air. I'm going to the police.
Here she is.
Angela, where have you been?
I'm sorry, Franz. Really.
We were worried about you.
Please forgive me.
Of course, but—
Won't you tell me what happened?
I— I don't know.
You don't know?
Angela, I waited for you at the theater for hours. You must have gone someplace.
Let's not talk about it tonight, Franz.
I— I'm very tired.
Some other time.
Angela, forgive me.
L— I was so worried about you,
I forgot to tell you how wonderful you were.
I was in the audience, you know.
You—You got five curtain calls.
Then when I left and waited for you—
I didn't wait so long.
Leon told me that across the street there was a little jewelry shop... where men bought their present, and then they—
Well—
For you.
To—
To remind you of your first success.
My first success.
Oh, Franz.
Oh, my darling.
Please hold me tight.
Franz, I— I'm afraid.
Afraid of what?
I— I don't know.
They tell me she's young, beautiful and really can sing.
Good morning, Count. May I have a statement for my newspaper? Now, gentlemen. Please.
The Magic Voice has been out of the repertory for 10 years, hasn't it?
Yes, ever since La Marcellina's strange disappearance.
Then you found the new soprano.
Then I found Miss Klatt.
Did you say "Klatt"?
Franz.
#Warriors bold
We are come to this garden fete #
#Marching to love as we march to war #
Good morning, my dearJarmila.
Well, our baritone is positively glowing this morning.
Glowing with new admiration for you, my dear.
Few prima donnas would confess so openly they had anything to learn.
I salute you.
Anything to learn?
It takes character to understudy a newcomer.
Understudy?
Your new soprano will never sing The Magic Voice. Oh, no?
No! Seebruck's insane to even consider letting a young, inexperienced girl like that—
You forget, my dear, that once upon a time you were a girl.
#... the greatest game of all #
#Love is no trifling thing to a maid in the spring #
#So best be wary, lad or you will be had #
# Yes, you'll be had and that is bad for men of arms #
#Ah, yes, that is bad for mighty men of arms ##
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
This is followed by the baritone solo and ballet.
We have the sketches of the set.
Would you like to see them? Not now.
The ballet is followed by the soprano aria.
We'll omit the baritone solo and the ballet.
I want these gentlemen of the press to hear Miss Klatt. Of course. Gentlemen.
We take it from the soprano aria.
Signor Roselli on stage, please.
Attention, gentlemen.
The ladder back, please.
Miss Klatt! On stage, please.
# I was all alone #
#A blindly groping maid #
# My heart was still my own #
#Just hoping, yet afraid #

- #Then I came and found you there #
# I called your name and breathed a prayer #
# I began to live #
# The moment that I knew #
#The clouds began to give #
#The sun came shining through #
#Above # # You were mine to have and hold #
# But even then the sun grew cold #
#Ah #
# Tell me why this doubt should fall to me #
#Whose tragic power—##
"Whose tragic power calls for me. "
I— I'm sorry.
May I try that last part again?
Of course, my dear.
Of course.
#Ah #
#Tell me why this doubt—#
Why, darling, what happened?
Quite the real thing.
Angela, what happened?
My voice— It's gone.
That's ridiculous.
My voice— It's gone!
Stop saying that and come here.
Franz. What's the matter with me?
Nothing. People don't lose their voices like that. You've got to sing.
I— I can't, Franz.
For some reason, I don't want to sing.
Angela!
For me, darling.
Now, from the same place.
#Ah #
#Tell me why this doubt should fall to me #
#Whose tragic power—##
Young man, how did you get in this dressing room?
Do you realize that by forcing her voice, you might ruin it forever?
- I'm only trying to help. She lost her confidence. That's all.
- Is that true, Doctor?
Why do you think her voice broke?
High tension, nerves.
And it could be serious?
It could be if not taken care of.
What do you advise, Doctor?
A few days, at least, of absolute rest.
But rehearsal— You can rehearse with the understudy.
But you won't have to.
I tell you she's perfectly all right.
It's quite obvious she's not perfectly all right.
Her voice did break.
We all heard it.
I would suggest that we leave it to Miss Klatt herself.
What with your nerves in this condition, do you think you ought to sing?
I don't know.
I never felt like this before.
We'd better send her home, Brunn.
Where does she live?
Fifteen Hahnen Street.
I'm afraid that won't do.
She must have professional care.
The hospital?
How would you like to come home with me for a few days?
I'll come and see you, Angela.
I'd wait, my boy.
She needs complete rest.
That woman must have blackmailed
Seebruck into giving her the part.
After the papers have been full of nothing but The Magic Voice,
Seebruck will have to produce it.
But it isn't for her.
She can never sing the aria.
They can lower the key.
But it's Angela's part.
There was nothing wrong with her— until she met Hohner.
Dr. Hohner wants to help Angela.
Then why does he keep her locked up?
Why can't I go and see her?
She hasn't even answered my letters.
I'm going to take her back where she belongs. Franz.
Yes?
I would like to see Dr. Hohner.
Dr. Hohner never sees patients at this hour. But I'm not a patient.
It's— It's a personal matter, and it's very important.
What is it about?
Angela Klatt.
Angela Klatt?
I've got to see her.
I'm afraid you'll have to come another time.
The doctor is just leaving for the theater.
I've decided not to go to the theater tonight, Luise.
Oh, but that was a message from Count Seebruck.
The new tenor has a sore throat. Oh.
Why don't you go home? Now, why don't you go to the theater?
You should be there by now.
But, Franz—
Go on. Don't worry about me. I just want to see what happens. Go on.
She's upstairs. Hurry.
Angela. Angela, it's Franz.
Angela, what's the matter?
Don't you know me?
Good evening, Dr. Hohner.
Good evening, Leon.
Who is that singing?
That's the new tenor.
Well, there's nothing wrong with his throat. No, sir.
Get her out of here now before it's too late.
Angela, we're getting out of here. I mustn't leave. He doesn't want me to leave.
Let me stay, Franz. Please let me stay.
I'll take you home to Mama Hinzl and Carl.
Hurry. Please hurry.
The back door.
Quickly.
To the left, out the door and through the gate.
Dr. Hohner!
Dr. Hohner! Dr. Hohner!
Dr. Hohner, she's gone.
How? Where were you?
After you left, I went down to the kitchen to look after some things.
A little later, I came up to see her.
She wasn't here.
I searched everywhere, but she was gone.
They must have been watching the house for days, waiting for a chance.
Who brought that message from the theater?
I don't know.
I never saw him before.
Franz. The young fool.
What are you going to do?
Nothing.
That girl will obey me no matter where she is.
I fixed you some nice hot soup, dear.
Put it over here, Mama Hinzl.
No, Franz. You mustn't touch it.
Angela, it's just an atomizer.
He— He told me something about it.
Franz, what did he tell me?
Can't you remember?
I— I can't.
But I— But I must.
It was very important.
Don't worry about it now.
Mama Hinzl is going to give you your soup.
Franz, don't leave me.
All right, darling.
Now close your eyes and try to sleep.
Think of nothing else.
You saw the chemist? It's water,
Uncle Carl— plain everyday water.
Water?
Yes. You are sure this came out of the atomizer?
Yes. I took it out when Angela was asleep.
I was sure there was something in there that stopped her from singing, but now I—
Oh, Uncle Carl, what is it— her imagination?
When did her voice break first?
When she was singing the aria.
At rehearsal, with
Hohner watching her. Yes.
And the next time?
In her dressing room.
And Hohner walked in.
All this after she had been to his office for treatment.
He must have frightened the child. But why?
Marcellina. The aria.
Who can tell what goes on in a man's mind? And who can prove it?
Oh, Carl, what are we going to do?
I don't know.
In the army, when a man was thrown from a horse, we put him right back on the horse and made him ride.
And it worked?
Usually.
The longer a man waited, the more difficult it became.
Something in his mind grew into a terrible mental hazard.
Men, horses— I know.
But it's different with singers.
Why should it be different with singers? The same hazard.
Of course! That's it.
Franz, where are you going?
Wait for me.
What you ask is not only impossible.
It's fantastic. But the girl is very ill.
We not only ask you to save her career, but her life as well.
Dr. Hohner tells me she's lost her voice beyond recovery.
Dr. Hohner is wrong.
Let's be reasonable about this thing.
All I demand is a chance to hear her sing.
I've asked you to bring her here to my office.
But, no, you must have my company, my orchestra, lights— a full performance for your experiment before an audience.
It's absolutely out of the question.
That will be all, gentlemen.
But, Count Seebruck—
Franz.
I told you it was a hopeless task.
We gave him his chance. Now he has only himself to blame.
We are going over his head.
But who is over his head?
The king.
The king?
Do you mean to say we should ask the king himself?
Come on.
Is this the cross he gave you personally?
Hundreds of us got the same decoration.
And it wasn't him. It was his father who gave it to me.
Just stick your chest out.
I'm going to lose my job.
Seebruck will discharge me. You must have been much braver when you were young.
No one is permitted in this corridor until His Majesty has left the theater.
Oh, but— but His Majesty will grant him an audience.
You should know better. You will have to make your petition in writing.
Gentlemen, His Majesty the king.
- Well, one of the heroes from Sadova.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Second Cavalry, Blue Hussars.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I am sorry, Your Majesty.
This corridor should have been cleared of petitioners.
One of my father's old guard may talk to me at any time.
Now, what can I do for you?
It's about a singer.
Ayoung lady.
We are in love.
No. The young lady and I are in love.
Oh, I see. Well, in that case, shall we step in here?
Oh, this performance will be known as the most dismal fiasco... in the entire history of the Royal Theatre.
This will really make me immortal.
Seebruck.! I want to talk to you.
This is the last straw, and I don't intend to stand for it any longer.
There's no clause in my contract that calls for insults.
My name is on every billboard, and this— this nobody is singing in my place.
Do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to leave here and never come back.
I wish to heaven
I could go with you.
Oh, you sent for me?
Yes. Here, read this.
A command performance.
It's unbelievable.
What shall I do?
What can I do?
I would suggest that you have
MadameJarmila stand by.
Stand by? And let her make a fool of me?
You don't have to bother about that.
It will not be possible for that girl to sing.
How'd she take it?
I don't know.
I haven't told her anything except that we're going to the theater.
Oh, Mama Hinzl, I—
I don't want to go.
You run along with Franz.
See your friends.
Hear some music.
It will do you good.
You look wonderful, Angela.
Good night, Mama Hinzl.
Good night.
But how will I get to the theater?
Just walk if you have to, but leave them alone.
But, Mama Hinzl—
Good evening, Miss Klatt.
Good evening, Leon.
Count Seebruck wants to see you. Where is he?
Uh, Dressing Room 22.
Thank you, Leon.
Good evening, Miss Klatt.
Please come in.
This is Count Romborg, aide-de-camp to His Majesty.
Enchanted.
Miss Klatt, you are commanded by His
Majesty to sing The Magic Voice tonight.
I? Sing? Yes. A command performance.
But... I can't.
But it is His Majesty's orders.
My congratulations,
Miss Klatt.
This is a great honor, my dear.
But, Count Seebruck—
The king.
I'll send a maid to you.
Mr. Brunn. Now, now. Your wardrobe is all ready.
I'll see you on the stage.
Good luck.
Franz, I'm afraid.
No, you're not.
You're—You're probably as surprised as I am.
As Count Seebruck said, this is a great honor.
The king sends his aide-de-camp to command you to sing.
But that's why I'm afraid. I—
I can't sing. Of course you can.
The minute you're out there before the audience and— and hear that music, you'll sing.
Everybody wants you to. Look.
They're—They're all thinking of you.
They send you their— their good wishes. Here.
Here. Flowers from Seebruck, from Brunn, from Roselli.
Flowers even from His Majesty.
Franz, what's that?
Another present, I suppose.
We'll soon find out.
That is... just like the one you— you have at home.
Now I broke your present.
I— I'm sorry.
That was very clumsy of me.
Angela.
Was that very important?
Dr. Hohner told me something about it. My— My voice.
Oh, that's just broken glass and a little colored water.
Listen. Whatever Dr. Hohner said is past and gone—just like that.
Tonight is the night you've worked and studied for, the night we've dreamed of.
Do you know why The Magic Voice hasn't been performed for 10 years?
Because there was no one to sing it.
Now the king commands you to sing it.
That's what you've got to do. So forget Dr. Hohner. Forget everything.
Everything but— but me.
Of course, Franz.
And I'll really try.
I know you will.
And you'll be wonderful.
Now get dressed.
I'll call you when I'm changed.
How is she? Fine. Everything is going to work out as we planned.
I have fixed a place in the wings for you where Angela can see you while she sings.
Come. I'll show you.
Just a moment. Count Seebruck sent me to Miss Klatt.
You may help the ballet girls.
Yes, madame.
I came to help you dress.
The last time I saw Marcellina, she was standing right here, in a dress just like that.
You're as beautiful as she was.
Thank you, Luise.
I'll take this.
Would you ask Franz to come in now, please? Yes.
I've come to help you, my dear.
It's cruel of them to do this to you.
You don't want to sing, do you?
But I— I promised Franz I'd try.
Of course you did, my dear.
But Franz doesn't understand.
You're in no condition to sing, are you?
I— I don't know.
I only know
I promised Franz I'd try.
Dr. Hohner!
Don't look at me like that.
Franz!
What does Franz know about it?
Why, you're trembling, shaking.
Your nerves have gone to pieces.
I warned Franz what would happen if he forced you to sing.
You don't want to ruin that voice, do you?
It isn't yours. Remember?
Now tell me. Whose voice is it?
Tell me.
Marcellina's.
#Warriors bold
We are come to this fete #
# Marching to love as we march to war #
# Ready for any fate
We await duty's call #
# Eager to meet the foe
Even though we know #
#That we may all be captured by the lovely foe #
#We gladly go to meet in this fairy garden #
#Where we pirouette and posture #
# Here where romance seems to call in the measures of a dance #
#We bow and we smile and we preen for the ladies we adore #
#And pray that they soon may heed our pleas of love #
# Meanwhile, we know as they sigh most romantically #
#They have their minds on the greatest game of all #
# Love is no trifling thing to a maid in the spring #
# So best be wary, lad or you will be had #
#Yes, you'll be had and that is bad for men of arms #
#Ah, yes, that is bad for mighty men of arms ##
She ought to be ready by now.
Yes. I want to rehearse the aria once more anyway.
Angela, are you ready?
Angela.
Angela!
Angela!
Where is she?
Hohner.
Have you seen Dr. Hohner?
Not tonight.
I want to borrow this.
Carl!
This time, I'll silence it forever.
Murderer.
I suspected you from the first and came here as your servant to make sure.
For 10 years, I've watched and waited.
You kept your secret well until the first night you brought Angela here...
when you showed the pearls Marcellina had on when she disappeared.
You took them off her body.
I'm not afraid of you.
I needed more evidence for the police.
I got it tonight when I followed you here from the dressing room— in time to save this child.
You killed Marcellina.
You'll never say that again.
Dr. Hohner!
Angela, are you all right?
You should be at the theater.
You're singing The Magic Voice tonight.
She can't sing. I won't let her. She will sing, and you can't stop her.
If this girl sings, I won't be responsible. I will. Carl, watch him.
Get back, Doctor.
This way.
My dearJarmila, what a great night for you.
Yes, when your little Miss Nobody breaks down, I go on to save your face.
Why, not at all. You've always wanted to sing The Magic Voice.
This is your great opportunity.
And what an audience!
Haven't I always said that hers is the greatest voice in the country?
In the country, Count Seebruck?
In the world. In the world.
What about your brilliant new discovery?
Forget about her.
Forget about everything.
Go out there and cover yourself with glory.
Thrill the king and that distinguished audience with the golden voice of the greatJarmila.
All right. I'll do it.
But not for you or for the king.
ForJarmila.
Brava.
Send the police to
Dr. Hohner's. Yes, sir.
Where have you been?
We've looked everywhere.
This is a command performance for the king.
You've just time to make your entrance.
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
Luise, take care of her.
What about me and my golden voice?
Do you think I'm going to stand here and let that little— Shh! The king.
She ought to be there by now.
Don't go on that stage.
Your voice will break.
I warn you.
Don't go on that stage.
I forbid you to sing.
Do you hear?
- I forbid you to sing.
- Sit down.
Repeat the cue.
#Ah, we bid you welcome to this fete #
#Ah, we're sorry if we made you wait #
#Ah, let violins begin the dance #
#Ah, let there be joy and gay romancing #
#I was all alone #
#A blindly groping maid #
# My heart was still my own #
#Just hoping, yet afraid #
- # Oflove #
- #Then I came and found you there #
# I called your name and breathed a prayer #
# I began to live #
# The moment that I knew #
# The clouds began to give #
#The sun came shining through #
#Above # # You were mine to have and hold #
#But even then the sun grew cold #
#Ah #
#Tell me why this doubt should fall to me #
# Whose tragic power #
# Seems to call to me #
She made it.
#Please listen, darling #
Her fear of you is gone.
#This says it all for me #
# I love you #
Sing, Angela! Sing!
#Now, at last #
#Everything is clearing #
#Now, at last #
#Paradise is nearing #
#I cling #
# To your love #
# While I sing #
Up the stairs.
# Of my yearning #
Marcellina, they're here.
They're here.
# Now, at last #
# Gone is all confusion #
#And the past #
#Fades like some illusion #
#And you #
#Are my life #
#And my dream #
# Come #
#True #
#All I want #
#Is you #
Bravo.! Bravo.!
- Brava.!
Two times nine is 18.
Three times nine is 27.
Four times nine is 36.
Come in, please.
Here we are, Mary.
I have a most painful matter to discuss with you, Mary.
Your sister.
Have you heard from her lately?
No, Mrs. Lowood.
She doesn't write often.
- Have you any other relatives, Mary?
- No. Jacqueline brought me up.
Somehow I never felt
I needed other relatives.
That makes it all the more difficult.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
We don't know, Mary.
We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
Sometimes she can be quite careless.
- Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
- I've written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi.
She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.
It is six months, Mary, since your tuition has been paid.
Naturally, it's impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
- Of course.
- Miss Gilcrist and I...
...have talked the matter over.
You can stay on here and work...
...with the younger children as sort of an assistant teacher.
But, Mrs. Lowood,
I can't just stay on here...
...without knowing what's happened to my sister.
Maybe if I went to New York, if I saw Mrs. Redi myself...
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman.
But if you'd like to try...
...l'll advance the money to make the trip to New York.
Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister...
...you can always come back here.
Thank you.
Mary.
Don't come back.
No matter if you never find your sister.
No matter what happens to you.
Don't come back.
My parents died when I was a pupil.
I left as you are leaving.
But I didn't have courage.
One must have courage to really live in the world.
I came back.
Gilcrist.
Agnes, John Quincy Adams did not follow John Adams as president.
Build thee more stately mansions,
O my soul
As the swift seasons roll!
Leave thy low-vaulted past!
Let each new temple,
Nobler than the last
Shut thee from heaven
With a dome more vast
Till thou at length art free
That's enough.
It seems all right, Joseph.
You see, we do keep up the quality of La Sagesse products...
...in spite of Jacqueline's absence.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I'm afraid not.
Your sister had many friends, but they were not my friends.
I was only the manager of her plant.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing.
With Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business?
What do you do with the receipts?
How do you sign the checks?
Why, Mary, I'm amazed.
Didn't Jacqueline tell you?
She sold the business to me at least eight months ago.
- It's my business now.
- I didn't know that.
Yes, and I must say
I've done quite well with it.
Perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
There's nothing you can think of?
Old letters?
Anything that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Leave your address.
If I find anything, I'll be in touch.
- I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
- Thank you, my dear.
Why, Mary.
- Hello, Frances.
- How are you, honey?
- How's Miss Jacqueline?
- I don't know.
That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi.
I'm trying to find her.
You mean she's gone and you don't know where she is?
Come here a minute.
I don't get this.
Miss Jacqueline's so crazy about you.
She always talked about you, and she had your picture in her office.
I know.
For the first time
I'm beginning to feel frightened.
I almost feel as if
I'd never known my sister.
Nothing's happened to her.
It's just I can't understand her not keeping in touch with you.
- I can't understand it at all.
- Well, don't worry about it.
I saw Miss Jacqueline myself about a week ago.
At a restaurant the boyfriend took me to.
A little Italian place down in the Village called the Dante.
- The Dante?
- Yes, it's on Perry Street.
Why don't you ask the people who own the place? They'll remember Jacqueline.
Anybody who ever sees her never forgets her.
I'll try there.
I'm sorry to bother you.
- I want to ask you about my sister.
- Yes?
I thought you might know her.
She was seen here about a week ago.
Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
I don't know no Gibson.
This is a restaurant.
- Many people come here.
- She's very beautiful.
I wish I could tell you what she looks like.
I'm sure you'd remember her.
She's tall, with dark hair.
Once you'd seen my sister, you'd never forget her.
- Maybe.
- Let me look at you.
- You could be her sister.
- Yes.
Yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
She hasn't been here for a long time.
- But she was here?
- Oh, yes, yes.
One day a beautiful car comes here.
This beautiful woman in furs gets out.
There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur.
The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms...
...and the chauffeur changes the lock on the doors.
Then the lady does not come back.
Not to live anyhow.
She came back three or four times.
But always alone. Just to eat.
You mean she just came here, rented the room...
...locked it and left?
- Yes, and pays the rent every month.
Could you let me see that room?
If it is hers...
...there might be something there to help me find my sister.
No, the rent is paid.
The lady asked us to promise.
- I won't open the door.
- Please.
It's important.
What did he say?
He said he always wanted to see the inside of this room anyway.
I tell you, when a thing like this comes up...
...you've got to go to the police.
What do you think people pay taxes for?
It ain't just to keep us chasing after crooks and regulating traffic.
We're supposed to help everybody.
Now, you've got to go to the police about your sister, miss.
I've had some experience with the Bureau of Missing Persons...
Yeah. Well, Mr. Hoag...
...lost persons are the concern of the Missing Persons Bureau.
You stick to your poetry.
You're the poet, Jason.
Well, in a way that makes everything my business, doesn't it?
- Were you going to make a suggestion?
- Yes.
I was going to ask you to look into your own heart.
Do you really want to find your sister?
Oh, my Jason.
Always laughing, always joking to help others.
He's a good boy, miss.
He just talks that way.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
Now, you do what I tell you...
...and go to the Missing Persons Bureau for your sister.
- If you'll give me the address.
- Certainly.
- She was only 16.
- Had she ever run away before?
- What did he have on when last seen?
- He went out without his hat or his coat.
It's very cold for such an old man.
Any identifying marks or characteristics?
Scars, amputation, tattoo marks, speech impediments?
No, none.
Sign here.
Any further details?
She sold her business about eight months ago to Mrs. Esther Redi.
What relation are you to the missing person?
Sister.
Sign here.
Excuse me. I'm Irving August.
Private investigator.
I think I can help you.
Here's my card.
The name may not mean anything to you...
...but say the word and
I'll have her in 48 hours.
- Can you?
- Look, sister.
Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and a half miles wide.
I ain't never been off it.
I know it like...
Like you know your own back yard.
Now you just get me a small retainer, say, 50 bucks...
...and I get your sister. I guarantee it.
- I haven't any money right now...
...but I'll get a job and...
- Lady, this kind of work costs money.
I gotta cover all the hospitals, the morgue.
That's the first place you gotta go and it ain't pleasant, the morgue.
- You know who I am, August?
- Sure, I do.
Then you know if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
- Yeah, sure.
- That girl was looking...
...for Jacqueline Gibson.
If I were you, I'd forget it.
Okay, Mr. Radeau. It's forgot.
Hey, Danny, get me the file on Jacqueline Gibson, will you?
- Whom do you wish to see?
- Mr. Gregory Ward, please.
- And what is it about, Miss Gibson?
- A personal matter.
- I was given Mr. Ward's name.
- May I ask who gave you his name?
The morgue.
Do you feel all right?
I feel like an idiot, fainting in a stranger's office.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary.
Jacqueline spoke about you often.
I suppose she told you about me.
No. At the morgue, they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward...
...had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
- At the morgue? No wonder you fainted.
- I wish you'd come to me first.
- Then you know who Jacqueline is?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Why?
I love your sister, Mary.
I love her very much.
It's easy to understand now, isn't it?
A man would look for her anywhere, Mary.
There's something exciting and unforgettable about Jacqueline.
Something you never quite get hold of.
Something that keeps a man following after her.
Because I loved Jacqueline,
I thought I knew her.
Today I found out such strange things.
Frightening things.
I saw a hangman's noose that Jacqueline had hanging, waiting.
Well, at least I can explain that.
Your sister had a feeling about life...
...that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it.
- I helped her get that room.
- Weren't you afraid?
Afraid she might commit suicide?
People who commit suicide don't talk about it.
No, that room made her happy...
...in some strange way
I couldn't understand.
She lived in a world of her own fancy.
She didn't always tell the truth.
In fact, I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.
- It's difficult to explain to a youngster.
- I'm not a youngster.
- I can understand.
- Color's returning to your cheeks.
You look as if you were coming back to life.
Sure you didn't faint because you were hungry?
- You know, I didn't have lunch.
- Well, it's nearly 6. Time for dinner.
- Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
- Good.
But I feel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
Look, you can't make looking for Jacqueline your life's work.
You've got to do other things.
Live, get some enjoyment out of life.
- I hope you'll let me help you.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mary.
Miss Gibson, I've been waiting for you.
I want you to know
I decided to take your case.
- Mr. August, I'm not at all...
- Look, don't say a word.
I've taken an interest in you and I'm willing to help you.
I think I know where to find your sister.
- Where?
- Wait a minute. This has a lot of angles.
You've gotta take it easy.
Tell me, do you know a Mrs. Redi?
- Yes, she bought my sister's business.
- That's what she told you.
I looked it up in the Hall of Records.
Your sister deeded her the business...
...as an outright gift.
- Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
That's what I tried to find out.
I went to the La Sagesse...
...used a phony health inspector's badge.
They let me go through the works.
All but one room.
That room was locked.
- I'd like to see the inside of that room.
- You think my sister is there?
- Can't tell.
- Can we go there now?
You can't just go breaking into places.
They got a night watchman and locks on the door.
If she's in there, it won't make any difference about warrants.
- I want to go there.
- I don't know if...
...if I wanna go with you or not.
Which room is it?
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
You scared?
Yes.
- Let's get out of here.
- No.
You could go on, Mr. August.
You could open the door.
I'd stay right here.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
We can't stand here all night.
You could go and open the door.
Mr. August, the night watchman.
The night watchman, he's in the salon.
Mr. August, what is it?
What's the matter?
Mr. August.
Do you know where you're going, lady?
You've been to the end of the line and back again.
I hope you enjoyed the ride.
Please. Please.
I want your help, please.
Those men, don't let them get out.
- What's the matter now?
- One of them has been murdered.
What men?
But they were there.
Oh, yeah?
Extra! Murder, read all about it!
Extra! Murder, read all about it!
Extra! Murder, read all about it!
Extra! Murder, read all about it!
Thank you.
It's about another murder.
A woman on 52nd Street.
But you do believe me.
Well, the important thing is the police won't believe you.
I saw him on the floor.
He was cut here.
The blood was running out.
He was dead, I know it.
And then on the subway I saw him.
White. With the men holding him up between them.
Yes, of course. But the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
He was a kind little man in his way.
And I made him go down that hall into the darkness.
I made him do it.
Drink your milk.
I don't like to be ordered to do anything.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
- But you have treated me that way.
- I won't do it again.
We're friends. I promise
I'll never order you about again.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally.
And I'm going to take charge right now.
- I have a job for you.
- A job?
Remember you told me you're good with youngsters?
Well, today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler.
She runs a settlement house down in the Village.
- She's looking for a kindergarten teacher.
- I'd like that.
It's not much money, but it'd be enough to live on.
You'd move out of that hotel to a furnished room.
Maybe the Romaris would have a room.
They seem nice.
- The people at the restaurant?
- Yes.
If you want, I have time to take you to see Mrs. Wheeler right now.
Yes, sir. Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes.
- Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
- Thank you.
- Dr. Judd? Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
- Yes.
I read your book in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
- You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
- No, it's...
It's my father.
I wanted to talk to you.
You wrote about cures.
I'm sorry, I don't practice anymore.
I find it easier to write about mental illness...
...and leave the cure of it to others.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Ward is free now, doctor.
There are other psychiatrists who can help your father.
Dipsomania is rather sordid.
Thank you.
I've come from Jacqueline.
She needs money.
I thought you didn't know where she was.
I didn't. She came to me a few days ago.
To put it delicately...
...her care imposes a financial burden upon me.
She thought you might lighten that burden.
If she wants money from me, she can come to me herself.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward.
- It would endanger her.
- This is nonsense.
Unless I know where Jacqueline is and how she is...
...l'm not going to give you any money.
You're a curious man.
You're willing to jeopardize her life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
It's not just for myself I'm asking.
Her sister's here.
The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
As a man you distrust me.
Perhaps you can believe me as a physician.
Well, then I can tell you in addition to other dangers...
...there's a danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity.
- I would advise against you seeing her.
- But why?
She's been ill, erratic, but I've never known of anything like that.
You can believe me or not just as you choose.
- How much does she want?
- She can use a hundred dollars.
- I'll give you a check.
- She can only use cash.
- I haven't got that much in cash.
- How much have you?
About 45 dollars.
For the time being,
I imagine that must do.
Thank you.
- Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
- As beautiful as ever.
- Tell me...
- She's nervous under the circumstances.
What circumstances?
Mama, see, Miss Gibson helped me.
- It's a table.
- Beautiful. We show it to Papa tonight.
- Did Michelle eat her soup today?
- She's been an angel.
- Mommy, wait for me.
- Angelo, wait.
Well, Mary, aren't you the popular one.
You've a visitor again.
- Mr. Ward?
- No, not this time.
It's a gentleman called Judd.
Dr. Judd.
- Dr. Judd?
- Yes, Miss Gibson.
I've come to take you to your sister.
Don't be so amazed, it's a very ordinary matter.
I'm Jacqueline's physician.
Mr. Ward told me you were here.
Jacqueline sent me...
...to bring you to her.
- Then you know where she is?
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her?
Get your hat and coat.
We haven't much time.
It's amid marble splendors such as these that Jacqueline dwells.
One can take either staircase.
I prefer the left, the sinister side.
She's not here. She's gone.
I don't know why she left.
She knows she shouldn't have.
She's left me to meet them alone.
I can't.
What makes you so nervous, Dr. Judd?
Who are they?
I can't stay here. I'll have to leave you.
Jacqueline.
Is this her?
No.
- Where's Jacqueline Gibson?
- I don't know.
- She was just here. Where did she go?
- I tell you, I don't know.
You went out with her and don't know where she went?
I don't know.
Why do you want Jacqueline?
What right have you to question me?
I have all the right in the world.
I'm Paul Radeau, a private investigator.
I've been hired to find your sister by her husband...
...Gregory Ward.
- Husband?
What are you thinking of, Bella?
Can I eat dry?
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Look, Mary, just because I kept a secret from you doesn't make a monster of me.
Please, I can't go on explaining things like this to your right ear.
Last night in this very restaurant,
Mr. Jason Hoag...
...paid a pretty compliment to my right ear.
- Who the devil is he?
- A poet.
He's sitting right over there.
That's his table, the one at the feet of Dante.
Do you remember the first day you came to my office, frightened and broken up?
And I asked you if Jacqueline had ever spoken about me to you? You said no.
Then how could I tell you we were married?
And afterwards...
I didn't tell you afterwards because there were so many things coming up...
...to make me worry.
My beautiful one.
Why do you bring me wine...
...when you yourself are so intoxicating?
You're my favorite audience, Bella.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are?
Laugh and have a good time?
That poor little one, so sad because she can't find her sister.
And that man with her, he doesn't make her laugh.
Just sits and talks.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything...
...and I have nothing to lose.
You should make her laugh, Jason.
Come, make jokes for her.
You could have told me you were Jacqueline's husband.
Things changed, Mary.
The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed.
I want to find her to settle things.
What things? Why?
Why you two are so sad?
Your food will not digest...
...and your wine will sour.
You must laugh to eat well.
I've brought Jason to make you laugh.
Mr. Hoag, this is Mr. Ward.
Sit down. I'll get the rest of your dinner.
I'm under orders to make you laugh.
In Mrs. Romari's mind, poetry and humor have some strange affinity...
...which they don't have in fact.
She wants me to play the fool for you...
...but suddenly, Miss Gibson,
I feel as sad as you do.
Well, then I've spoiled your dinner.
Your food won't digest and your wine will sour.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be serious.
I'm going to find your sister.
Shuffle the cards well, Natalie.
This is a trick of telepathy, not card manipulation.
Now pass the cards to me.
Gladys, will you hand the cards to Louis while I answer the door?
- Jason. How nice to see you.
- I have brought some friends, Natalie.
- May we come to your party?
- Oh, of course, come in.
Now, all of you must remember the cards that you've selected.
- Mrs. Cortez, Mary Gibson and Mr. Ward.
- So nice to meet you.
The cards can't speak for themselves.
- It's purely a matter of the mind.
- You'll have to excuse me.
Mrs. Freeman, yours was the jack of spades. Gladys, seven of diamonds.
- Yours, Mrs. Gosden, the queen of hearts.
- How do you ever do it, Louis?
Hello, Jason.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
- What a peculiar question.
- I saw you with her last week.
I knew you'd be here tonight.
Where is she?
It's neither your business to ask nor mine to tell.
Wait. Look over there.
Do you see that girl?
That's Jacqueline's sister.
It's because of her that I ask.
Why come to me?
Because there was another girl years ago.
A nice girl.
She lived in Barrow Street.
I saw her with you once.
I saw her with you twice.
- Then I never saw her again.
- She was my patient.
What was she to you?
I don't think you'd understand if I told you.
I think I understand without your telling me.
I know something of your history, Jason.
I know you haven't written for 10 years.
I've lost the knack.
After that wonderful first book?
After all the adulation and good reviews?
I'd have given anything to have written that book.
You had all my admiration and respect...
...once.
There you are.
Do you know any more card tricks?
Hello, Ward.
My dear Miss Gibson.
Gibson? Are you Jacqueline's sister?
- Yes, do you...?
- Know her?
My dear, we were intimate.
The times we used to have together.
I bet she never told you about that.
You're too young.
I'm afraid you don't understand.
Miss Gibson's sister is missing.
Missing? Well, no wonder.
When she took up with Louis Judd, she went out of circulation just like that.
My dear, have I said something?
Too many people here.
Perhaps Jacqueline is lonely for me.
You see, Mary, I'm not quite a fool.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
- Yes.
- And you knew he'd be here.
Yes.
And now that I've shown you that
I know that much, and can guess more...
...will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
I'm a terrible failure, Mary.
A book clerk by day and a poet by night.
Not a very good one.
But if you'll trust me, at this one thing I won't fail.
I'll find your sister.
You have such lovely hands,
Miss Gottschalk. So slim and capable.
Mr. Hoag, I really shouldn't be doing this.
It's against the rules.
Why did you say you wanted them?
I'd like to see what books my friends read so I'll know what to buy them.
Nothing nicer than a book for a gift.
Who was the first one? Mrs. Redi?
P, Q, R...
Yes, here it is.
- And the other was Judd?
- Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
He's here too.
Would it be asking too much for you to get me these books?
No, not at all, Mr. Hoag.
Why, Mr. Hoag, most of these books are on the closed shelf.
You'll have to get permission.
I wouldn't want to take them out.
I'd like to look at them.
Well, since you're over 21.
Mimi.
Come in.
Well, what is it?
A parallelogram with a split triangle in its very center.
I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
- I don't think that's so revealing.
- But who is Judd?
A psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books...
...on the history of old religious societies.
But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor?
- I don't know.
- That's just it.
And this figure, she traced it.
The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect"...
...by the library inspector in March.
Mrs. Redi had it out in April, and no one else had read it since.
This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
It's all clear to me now. So clear.
I thought so, but just to be sure
I'll tell you that the Palladists...
...are a society of devil worshippers.
- Devil worshippers?
But, look, I'm serious.
It's a very real and earnest society.
A dangerous society.
I can imagine.
Sometime before those nice white gloves are dry...
...you're going to go and find out a few things about this Mrs. Redi.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
Oh, Redi's all right.
But there's only one Miss Jacqueline.
Mrs. Redi seems rather an odd woman to me.
She's really a pretty good sort.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
It's always seemed to me that she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
Well, Mary, I guess most people are.
There, that's it.
In the old days, this would've been on the house.
The tip is anyhow.
Besides, I like to do your hair.
Thank you.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
Why, I ought to.
Mrs. Redi's new trademark.
Of course, I should've known.
This figure's been puzzling me.
Hello, Mary. It's nice to see you.
- No news of Jacqueline?
- I'm afraid not.
Well, that's too bad.
What did she want?
Nothing. I just did her hair.
What were you talking about?
Nothing.
Nothing? Why, that's absurd.
I heard you laughing and talking.
She was asking questions.
Oh, well, she was asking about you.
Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
And that was all?
Well, she asked about the trademark.
- What did she want to know?
- She showed me a drawing.
Oh, you fool.
Why, that symbol is us.
Us. She was asking about us.
- Mary?
- Yes.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
Oh, I'll be out in a minute.
That won't be necessary.
I haven't much to say.
If I were you, Mary,
I'd go back to school.
I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
I can't give up looking for her,
Mrs. Redi.
No matter what you're hinting at.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting.
Your sister, Mary, is a murderess.
She killed Irving August.
Stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
I don't believe you.
I had to help get rid of the body.
You saw it on the subway.
And I warn you, Mary, go back.
You don't know what you're doing...
...or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister.
You go back to school.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
We haven't begun tea yet.
- Hello, Frances.
- Hello, Mrs. Redi.
- How do you do?
- Mrs. Redi.
Won't you pour?
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.
- This is very trying for me.
- I know.
You introduced Jacqueline to us.
- But how could you tell?
- I should've known.
She had no sincerity, no real belief.
Miss Rowan, do you take cream?
Please, Natalie, would you mind pouring?
You shouldn't be nervous.
There's nothing personal or vengeful in what we are about to do.
We have only to make a decision.
But it can be such a horrible decision...
...because we're all pledged to nonviolence.
- Now, this...
- Our founder must have known...
...when he wrote these seemingly contradictory rules.
The rule of nonviolence...
...and the law that whoever betrays us must die.
- He must have known.
- But I don't understand it.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
Yes, I suppose so.
I went back through the history last night.
I read about Johann Rozenquartz.
- I read what he wrote about...
- I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi.
"We will avoid violence.
For once undertaken, violence can become its own master...
...and lead to either good or evil."
- But he also wrote...
I can quote that too.
"Those who go out into the marketplaces and speak of us...
...and give knowledge of our being and our deeds...
...whomsoever doeth this shall die."
I'm puzzled.
Since our order was founded...
...six betrayals have been listed.
And six deaths as punishment.
- And now there's Jacqueline.
- Oh, but...
But you can't do anything to her.
You mustn't hurt her.
- But she betrayed us, Frances.
- She didn't betray us.
She was only going to a doctor.
A psychiatrist.
She told him, Frances.
She told him about us.
I know this is difficult for you.
- I know that you love her.
- But she didn't betray us.
Even if I believed that, I would still consider her a very dangerous woman.
There is the matter of Irving August's death.
Without consulting me,
Mrs. Redi was ill-advised enough...
...to have the body removed by Leo and Durk.
This makes us all a party to the crime.
What if there's a trial?
What if Jacqueline is asked about the removal of the body?
Do you think, Frances, that she will keep silent?
It is a real danger and one which forces our decision.
- And Jacqueline's sister?
- I've taken care of Mary.
I've spoken to her, and she's going back to school.
Good. Then it is decided.
Leo and Durk and I will complete our plans.
Mary.
This is wonderful, your coming here so unexpectedly.
It's almost like a wish come true.
I want to show you my room.
I want you to see all of it.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's grown big with the years.
And my window, through which I see the world.
It's beautiful. That searchlight and the stars.
Oh, that's not a searchlight.
It's a sword blade, cutting the blue cloak of a prince.
- Not stars...
- Jason.
I'm going back to Highcliffe.
I've come to say goodbye.
But I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me...
Well, that it was your advent into my world.
It turns out to be goodbye. Why?
Please don't make me tell you, Jason.
I thought I was your friend, Mary.
Just goodbye isn't enough for a friend.
I had begun to write again.
That's what I was doing when you came in.
It's because of Jacqueline.
I can't go on looking for her.
You went to see Mrs. Redi.
She told you something. What was it?
Jacqueline's a murderess.
She killed a man.
- You believe that?
- I have to.
It was Irving August.
Everything Mrs. Redi said, it fits in with what I saw.
She even knew that I'd seen his body on the subway.
But if it's true, then...
...there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
And Gregory, he loves her.
He loves you, Mary.
You'll have to tell him.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't.
But you've got to tell him, Mary.
Even if only for the practical reason that he's a lawyer and will know what to do.
I'm going to phone him.
Well, she's got to be found.
That's the first step.
She's got to be found so she can give herself up to the police.
But we've tried so long to find her.
Judd could tell us, if he would.
- Do you think he knows about this?
- I don't know.
Well, he's clever, and he's cautious in his way.
I think if he knew he'd advise her to do what I want.
Surrender herself to the police and stand trial.
I don't think he knows.
We could tell him.
- Could you find him?
- I suppose so.
I guess I could pick him up somewhere.
Jason...
...I sometimes wonder.
You're so sweet to me.
So kind and sympathetic.
I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Thank me?
You don't have to thank me.
- What's that?
- Verse.
Verse I wrote.
Don't bother going up.
I can do this all night, Jason.
Watch.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
Well, it won't work.
Love and understanding...
...won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Actually, there are two favors
I want to ask.
One as a poet, one as a detective.
Sounds strange.
I'm going to be very wary.
Some time ago, you spoke about my writing again.
I want your help.
I'd like you to bring this to your publisher.
This is curious, Jason.
Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare weren't fit to tie your shoelaces.
Now this sudden humility.
I should like people to read what I have written.
I hope it'll find as much favor as your other book.
But somehow I doubt it.
The time is out of tune.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
Wait. There's that other favor.
- I'd forgotten.
- Tell me where Jacqueline is.
- We've got to find her.
- You don't expect me to do that, do you?
- Yes, when I tell you.
- Tell me what?
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is...
...when I tell you she's a murderess.
She killed a man.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish?
To awaken like Byron and find yourself famous?
- I think it's time.
- No other reason?
No woman?
Not the little Miss Gibson?
Perhaps.
Wait a minute. I'll call her.
Jacqueline, this is Judd.
Jacqueline.
- Who is it?
- Judd.
I'm here with your sister.
Come on down.
Oh, Mary.
Jacqueline.
It's all right.
You're safe.
Nothing's going to hurt you.
- Your husband seems very certain of that.
- Yes.
I'm very certain there's only one way to help you, Jacqueline...
...to protect you.
You've got to come with us.
Let me do all I can as a lawyer to straighten out Irving August's death.
You must come with us, darling.
Let us help you.
For me, this seems to be the end of a delightful relationship.
Here. This will put some life into you.
It's like coming back to life.
It would be much easier, Jacqueline, if you told me exactly what happened.
I'd know what to do for you.
Please, Jacqueline.
You know about the Palladists.
You know who they are...
...what they are.
I was one of them.
Jacqueline was always a sensationalist...
...trying to seize onto something.
Anything to bring her happiness.
Through Mrs. Redi, she stumbled onto the Palladist movement.
It appealed to her.
I wasn't happy with them.
I wanted to break away.
I was miserable.
I went to Louis for help.
They felt that I'd betrayed them.
They wanted me to die.
Kill myself.
They kept me locked up at La Sagesse.
I was there such a long time.
Imagine the effect of such imprisonment on Jacqueline.
I was terrified.
The darkness in the corners of the room...
...all the little noises.
Then one night the door opened.
A man came in.
Tiptoeing in.
I had a scissors in my hand.
I struck at him.
Don't. We know what happened.
Don't go on.
Any court in the land would understand.
We'll wait a few days, let you rest, then we'll go to the police.
Why can't Jacqueline stay here with me for a few days?
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
There's my old friend.
The searchlight?
- Cyrano's sword.
- That's a funny thing to call it.
I like it.
I've always loved the story.
A man knowing he couldn't have the woman he loved...
...and wooing her for his friend.
We're friends, aren't we, Gregory?
It's been a hard evening for both of you.
Perhaps you ought to take Jacqueline to your room, Mary.
Good night, Jacqueline.
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night.
This is no time to play Cyrano.
What was in your mind?
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline.
- To let her know.
- To let her know what?
That you love Mary.
She'll have to know sometime.
Not from me.
Not from Mary.
Goodbye, darling.
I'll only be gone until 3.
- Bye.
- If you get lonely...
...go down and see Mrs. Romari.
I told her you were staying with me.
I won't be lonely.
Yes, this is Mary.
But she couldn't have gone out.
No.
Are you sure it wasn't Jason she went with, or Mr. Ward?
Two men?
No.
I'll get home as soon as I can,
Mr. Romari.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation.
In this case, the obligation carried the necessity...
...of dying if one betrayed that secret.
You understand that, don't you?
Yes. I understand it.
Then you also understand that you must die.
No.
You've spoken so often of ending it all.
I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you.
- You have only to drink a little.
- Yes, Jacqueline.
You were always talking suicide, of ending your life when you wanted to.
Yes.
- When I wanted to.
- It doesn't matter.
You want to now.
You should want to.
It is your obligation, your duty.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
It won't hurt.
No, no, no.
You have a strange kind of courage, Jason.
Perhaps you have enough courage to hear...
...what I've kept from you all these years.
That girl you loved...
...that other patient of mine...
She didn't disappear.
She's in an asylum.
A horrible, raving thing.
I never wanted you to know.
And all the while...
...you've been my friend.
Please...
...may I have a drink of water?
I'm very thirsty.
Drink.
No.
There will be no water, and there'll be no rest. You may as well drink.
No, no!
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
- I'd like that.
- Jason.
I can't find Gregory.
I've been trying to find him.
What's wrong, Mary?
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me.
She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
- They may have been friends of hers.
- No.
She wouldn't go with anyone unless compelled.
These months of hiding have made her frightened of the streets and people.
- I wonder...
- What?
They may have found her.
Would they hurt her?
I don't know.
You'd better go up to your room and wait for us, Mary.
Go ahead, Jacqueline.
Go ahead.
It is late.
Drink it, Jacqueline.
There's nothing else for you to do.
They say you've got to die.
Drink it, Jacqueline! You've got to!
I can't stand this!
No. No, I can't let you die!
The only time I was ever happy was when I was working with you.
You were always so good to me.
You may go now, Jacqueline.
The decision was against violence, but there'll be another decision.
Today, tomorrow...
...we'll find you, but now you may go.
I told you you could go.
Please help me.
There's a man following me.
- I shouldn't wonder, babe.
- I'm serious. Help me.
I'll help you to a beer and a sandwich.
Come along, babe. Come along.
Who are you?
I'm Mimi.
- I'm dying.
- No.
Yes. I've been quiet.
Oh, ever so quiet.
I hardly move.
And yet it keeps coming all the time, closer and closer.
And I rest and I rest...
...and still I'm dying.
And you don't wanna die?
I've always wanted to die.
- Always.
- I'm afraid.
And I'm tired of being afraid.
Of waiting.
- Why wait?
- I'm not going to wait.
I'm going out, and I'm going to laugh and dance...
...and do all the things I used to do.
- And then?
I don't know.
You will die.
Now that you've hounded and worried her you don't even know where she is.
At least tell me, has she been here?
Yes. She left here an hour ago.
She may even be home by now.
Why don't you try it?
All right, Jason.
The devil worshippers.
The lovers of evil.
It's a joke.
Pathetic little joke.
We haven't asked your opinion.
I propose to give it to you anyway.
You're a poor, wretched group of people who have...
...taken the wrong turning.
Wrong?
Who knows what is wrong or right?
If I prefer to believe in satanic majesty and power, who can deny me?
What proof could you bring that good is superior to evil?
It's hard to put into words, but you're wrong.
One proof.
I'll prove you wrong.
This afternoon Jason and I were talking together...
...and I remembered certain phrases from childhood.
Simple half-forgotten words.
It was the Lord's Prayer.
I'm a physician...
...yet not I nor any of my colleagues, no matter how learned...
...have ever found a substitute for those words as a rule for human relationship.
You might remember them.
Forgive us our trespasses...
...as we forgive those who trespass against us.
There's a sentence for you people from that same prayer:
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
All right, thank you very much.
That was Dr. Judd, Mary.
He phoned to say
Jacqueline's on her way here.
- Gregory.
- Yes?
You better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
That's what I should have done yesterday.
I'll take her away someplace where she can rest.
Mary.
No, stay nearby.
I want to talk to you.
I love you.
- You know that.
- Yes.
I've never loved anyone before, Gregory.
And I do love you.
You must know that.
But Jacqueline's my sister...
...whom I'd lost and found again.
I know.
- I shouldn't have told you.
- No, I'm glad.
At least I've heard you say it.
I run to death...
... and death meets me as fast.
And all my pleasures
are like yesterday.

<font color="#E5E5E5">shaving lotion I see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you couldn't break</font> down one of the ingredients<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes he said</font> it<font color="#E5E5E5"> must be some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> element with which he's</font> not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar we won't get anywhere until</font> we identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just one other man</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font> town that might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to help us dr.</font>
Carruthers yeah Carruthers could help us
I found out he compounded that<font color="#E5E5E5"> lotion</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">well if you suspect Carruthers you're</font> barking up the wrong tree Johnny he's the last man<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this town that would</font> harm anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> why everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> loves him</font> maybe so<font color="#CCCCCC"> but here's something else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>
<font color="#CCCCCC">dog the Heath and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Morton fortunes are</font> based on a greaseless<font color="#E5E5E5"> cold cream formula</font> dr.

<font color="#CCCCCC">dollars and the others</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made a fortune</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">well it's common knowledge if he sold</font>
- out for cash when he could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had an</font>
- interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the firm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every.</font>
Victim had this stuff from<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font> laboratory<font color="#E5E5E5"> on him maybe you've been</font> working<font color="#E5E5E5"> too hard on this case Johnny</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I just like to get his reaction on</font> the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he denies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knowing anything</font>
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no there's a tie-up</font> somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you're bombing but</font> just to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that I'm following up</font> every clue we'll talk to him<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll put this in</font> another<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottle and without telling him</font> we know he compounded it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyze it doc I hope we're not</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">upsetting your work barging in on you</font>
<font color="#CCCCCC">this way no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no not at all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm anxious to</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">help solve these crimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> victims</font> were very dear friends of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine here's a</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">sample of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff young Morton and the</font> two<font color="#E5E5E5"> Heath boys had on them when they</font> were attacked<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> devil bat of course</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">it doesn't make sense to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font> bird would choose only people using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bath is not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bird</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a mammal</font> well anyway our<font color="#CCCCCC"> police chemists couldn't</font> break down one of the ingredients<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font> thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> karai</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font> compounded<font color="#CCCCCC"> this myself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a new</font> shaving lotion I'm experimenting<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font> the ingredient<font color="#CCCCCC"> your chemists couldn't</font> break down<font color="#E5E5E5"> I discovered years ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>
Tibet<font color="#E5E5E5"> how did you happen to put it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font> shaving lotion<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the lamas use it in</font> some of their religious rites as a perfume<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scent is very pleasant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font> can't be imitated by competitors<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Morton the two heath bar</font> is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> staff oh it is the</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our firm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try out any new</font> product before marketing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">that knocks our theory</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into a cocked hat</font>
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah we were hoping the unknown</font> ingredient might turn out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of a clue this isn't the kind of</font> bottle I give it out in but I presume
<font color="#CCCCCC">your chemist changed it when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font> analysis yeah is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else I</font>
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do to help tell me did you hear</font> professor<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raines on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the radio last night</font> yes it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting in very</font> asinine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean you believe there is a</font> devil<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beth why not you saw it didn't you</font>
<font color="#CCCCCC">well sure I did</font> so did Mary<font color="#CCCCCC"> then why worry about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font> one scientist says<font color="#E5E5E5"> after one scientist</font> got me fired you mean your newspaper discharged you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's right that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>
<font color="#CCCCCC">bad</font> then you were believing<font color="#E5E5E5"> heats will</font> before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mystery solve and by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font> going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay here and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve</font> since you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay here for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

Excuse me, please.
Lady, here's your bag.
What are you trying to do, ruin the lady's baggage? Where is it? This one.
There you are. I'm sorry. Thank you.
Come on, clean this up.
Straighten it out.
Wilbur, darling, are you all right?
Sandra, I hurt my poor little head.
Your head?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no.
Does this hurt?
Uh-uh.
Does that hurt?
Uh-uh.
Thank heaven. If anything happened to you, dearest,
I'd never forgive myself.
That kiss made everything all better.
You worry about me an awful lot, don't you?
You mean an awful lot to me. Tell me more.
I will... at dinner tonight. Okay.
Get up and go to work! That is, if your head doesn't bother you too much.
His head is all right. It is?
But is your head all right?
Certainly. Frankly, I don't get it.
And frankly, you never will.
I can't understand that dame.
Of all the guys around here, that classy dish has to pick out a guy like you.
What's wrong with that? Look at yourself in the mirror sometime.
Why should I hurt my own feelings?
Go answer the phone.
I'll pick these up.
Baggage room.
London?
Calling here?
This ain't collect, is it?
Oh, all right.
Put him on.
Hello? Do you have two crates addressed to the McDougal House of Horrors?
What's the number on the checks? Never mind that.
Tonight the moon will be full.
I haven't much time.
Listen closely.
I'm flying out of here at dawn.
Under no circumstances are you to deliver those crates until I arrive.
Understand?
Under...
Under...
Mr. McDougal, will you stop gargling your throat?
Hey, you'll have to get your dog away from the phone. I can't hear a word you're sayin'.
You're silly to call me all the way from
London just to have your dog talk to me.
That's great conversation.
The guy growls like a wolf.
The nerve of some people!
What can I do for you, bub?
I have two crates addressed to my House of Horrors, and I want immediate delivery.
My name's McDougal. McDougal? I just talked to you on the phone from London.
How'd you get here so fast? They shoot you out of a cannon? Are you crazy?
I've been here all the time.
Now get me those crates!
How long you been here? Five minutes.
I've been here five years, you don't see me yelling...
There's the insurance slip and the bill of lading. Now get me those crates!
Will you please stop yellin'? Come here. It's impolite to raise your voice.
Chick! Why didn't you give me these in the first place?
Chi... Chick, this man wants these crates.
Insured for $20,000.
We better look these up.
Must be valuable. I'll say they're valuable.
Wilbur?
Yes, Sandra?
He's busy.
Please.
That little fellow's impossible.
Hurry up with those crates!
Do you know what I've got in there? Haven't the slightest idea.
The greatest attraction the House of Horrors ever had, that's all.
One of them's a coffin containing the remains of the original Count Dracula.
The other's the body of the Frankenstein monster.
That combination's enough to scare the pants...
I mean, shirt right off your back, ain't it?
I don't scare easily. Neither do I where money's concerned.
I got 'em cheap. European agent picked my name right out of thin air.
Very interesting.
Yeah.
Mr. McDougal.
Hey, Chick, here's one.
Darling,
I have to run along.
Something's come up. That means we'll have to break our date tonight.
It ain't another man, is it?
Of course not.
Silly boy.
Boy, I'm floatin' on a cloud of love.
You little blimp, I'll let the air out of you if you don't give me a hand.
You understand that?
Thank you.
Boy, is this kid lost.
Take that rope. Get up on that box and tie it to that handle up there.
Okay.
Nothing matters no more.
I'm so happy. Go on, get up there!
Here it is.
Hold still now.
Whoa!
Chick!
Stop him! Is he trying to ruin me? You're insured.
Yes, and if those exhibits are damaged, I intend to collect.
Whoa!
Well, there you are. Shall
I wrap it up? No, you idiot.
Take those to my House of
Horrors and uncrate them.
If that's the way you handle baggage, I'm going to have the insurance agent there... to inspect them before I accept delivery.
Then it's gonna cost you overtime because I'm a union man.
I work only 16 hours a day. A union man only works eight hours a day.
I belong to two unions!
Get those down to my place! All right.
Hey, Wilbur, here's a key. Open the door.
I'm not gonna like this.
Come on, gimme a hand.
Come on, get it inside.
Pull it! You want me to do all the work?
Come on, help me with it, will ya?
Uh-oh. What's the matter now?
Somebody's got a knife in my back. Oh, nonsense!
Where's the switch?
Here.
Sandra should see you now.
Turn around. Look what you're afraid of.
Turn around!
I... Come on, get up on your feet. It's only a dummy.
Dummy nothin'. It was smart enough to scare me.
Get ahold of the box.
Go ahead.
Come on, swing it around.
Help a little bit.!
Oh!
Ah, ah!
You fraidy-cat. These things can't harm ya. They're made out of wax.
People pay McDougal cash to come in here and get scared.
I'm cheatin' him. I'm gettin' scared for nothin'.
Go ahead and push.
Don't knock anything over.
There we are. Now we get the dolly out from underneath there.
Lift up that end.
Lift it up!
Come on, come on.
There you are.
Put it down, put it down.
Do I have to do all the work?
I'll get it down.
Put it down.
Go ahead.
Now open it up.
I'm going out and get the other crate. And no back talk!
I've got just two words to say to you. What is that?
Hurry back.
Aah!
Hello?
Yes, Mr. McDougal.
Yeah, the crates are here.
Wilbur's opening one now.
Mm-hmm.
Everything's all right.
Okay, Mr. McDougal.
Good-bye.
Chick?
Oh, Chi... ick!
What's the matter?
Did you turn out the light? Certainly not.
They're out.
So what?
Maybe the lightning struck the power line.
I get in more messes around here. Take off that canvas.
Take it off?
Take it off!
Hey, a coffin!
C-Coffin.
Dracula crest.
Dracula's crest.
I wonder if Mr. McDougal expects people to think that Dracula's really in there.
No, don't.
Please don't.
Oh, now come, come. Dracula was just a legendary character.
He never existed. Certainly not. No?
Fold up this canvas. I'm going out and get the other crate.
If you want me, just holler
"Oh, Chick!" You understand?
Oh, Chick!
What?
What kept you?
I haven't left yet.
The next time, don't take so long. Fold this up. Get busy.
"Count Dracula sleeps in this coffin... but rises every night at sunset. "
Chick is right.
This is silly stuff.
"Dracula... "
Chick! Chi... ick!
What's the matter? You know that person you said there's no such person?
I think he's in there... in person. I was reading this sign, "Dracula's Legend. "
All of a sudden I heard...
That's the wind.
It should get oiled.
Stop reading this. That's a lot of baloney to fool McDougal's customers.
Fold up that canvas.
Get busy. Come on.
"Dracula can change himself at will into a vampire bat, flying about the countryside. "
Flying.
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Chick!
Chick.!
You're making enough noise to wake up the dead!
I don't have to wake him up.
He's up. I saw a hand.
You saw a hand? Where? Right over there.
Let me see it.
Where is it?
I saw a hand there! You don't know what you're talking about!
You're excited reading this legend. Listen, Wilbur.
I know there's no such person as Dracula.
You know there's no such person as Dracula!
But does Dracula know it? Listen to me.
McDougal will be here any minute with the insurance agent. Now get to work!
"He keeps himself alive by drinking the blood... "
Chick. Chick.
Chick.
Chick. Ch...
Ch-Ch-Chick!
Oh!
Listen, this is getting to be ridiculous.
What?
Are you trying to tell me that candle moved?
Candles can't move!
This one did.
Watch it.
Keep your eye on it.
Is it moving?
Huh?
It's not moving, is it?
Not now.
Use your brains a bit.
Let's get this job finished.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
"He keeps himself alive by drinking the blood of his victims. "
Hmph. "Count Dracula must return to his coffin before sunrise.
He, he, he...
H-H-He... "
Chick! Chick!
Oh, Chick!
Ha-ha-ha, Chick!
Chick! Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, Chick, come on!
Come on!
All right,
I'm comin'.
Come on, will ya! Wait a minute. What's wrong now?
Oh, Chick!
You gonna tell me that candle moved again? Yeah, yeah.
I told you not to read this, didn't I? I can't help it.
"Count Dracula must return to his coffin before sunrise, where he lies helpless during the day. "
That's the bunk! That's what I'm trying to tell ya. That's his bunk!
Come here.
Don't, Chick. Come here.
Come here! Come around here!
Come over here.
Look in there.
Now, do you see anything?
No.
Certainly not.
Help me open that crate. Come on. Hmph.
Get with it, will you please?
You can always...
"Frankenstein's Monster. "
Get a load of this.
"A scientist named Frankenstein made a monster... by sewing together parts of old, dead bodies. "
Do you have to read that stuff? Wait.
"Frankenstein gave the monster eternal life by shooting it full of electricity.
Some people claim it is not dead even now, just dormant. "
Now who'd be silly enough to believe that?
Who would be silly enough to believe that?
Me.
Open up that crate.
Chick, did you hear that?
Yeah, I heard you pulling the nails out. Go ahead.
Pulling the nails?
Chick?
Quiet.
I don't want to hear any more of your foolish questions.
Come on, open up the crate.
There we are.
You've got it.
Now get ahold of it.
Throw it right on the side.
That's it, fine. Come on, help me with this excelsior.
Take it all out.
Wow! Look out!
Cover it up!
What's the matter? Cover the whole... Ooh, ooh!
Aw, stop that!
Uh-oh.
Now you did it.
What are you doing in there with the lights off?
McDougal!
Now we're in trouble.
Hide that head.
Hurry up!
Master.
Yes.
Come. Follow me.
Don't be afraid.
He won't hurt you.
Come!
Hurry up.
Come.
This better be a good one.
What's the matter, you afraid of the dark? No.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
What is this?
McDougal is here. I... What's the matter with you? Snap out of it.
Where are my bodies?
There were no bodies.
We opened both crates.
Look in there.
If they're not here, where are they? They must be stolen.
My company inspected the contents before they were shipped.
Then they must've been stolen en route. You saw them?
No, no. Then where did they go?
I don't know. If they're gone,
I want my insurance money.
My company doesn't pay off until a full investigation.
If you don't produce those bodies,
I'm going to call the police!
Police?
P-Police!
I can do better than that.
Police!
I'll get you.
Come on, go on!
Let's take it out.
Come!
Good evening,
Dr. Mornay.
My dear Count, it's so good to see you again.
And you look more charming than when I saw you last.
Come in, Count Dracula. Thank you, Sandra.
But the name is Dr. Lejos. I wouldn't want to frighten your technical assistant.
Professor Stevens?
Don't worry.
He's completely engrossed in his work.
Besides, he should be out of here by tomorrow. Excellent.
Yes, except that he's asking too many questions.
I will take care of that.
Is everything else arranged?
Yes. Where did you leave him? In the cold.
I'll get a wrap.
Nervous, my dear?
This is risky business.
Not as risky as those curious operations of yours... that so intrigued the European police.
Yet much more profitable.
Restore the monster for me, and you shall have anything you wish.
In that case, we better start as soon as possible.
It's dangerous to leave him in this weakened condition.
Have you mastered
Dr. Frankenstein's notebook?
Let me get my hand on a scalpel again and you shall see.
And about the brain!
I don't want to repeat
Frankenstein's mistake... and revive a vicious, unmanageable brute.
This time the monster must have no will of his own.
No fiendish intellect to oppose his master.
There, dear Count, I believe I have exceeded your fondest wishes.
The new brain I've chosen for the monster is so simple, so pliable, it will obey you like a trained dog.
Good.
How soon?
The day after tomorrow. Wilbur was taking me to a masquerade ball.
But I'm sure he'd prefer to spend a quiet evening at home.
Bring him through here.
I tell you, Chick, I saw what I saw when I saw it!
Keep quiet! You babbling about dead people walking away!
That's why we were arrested and thrown in jail.
Do you realize we've spent a whole day and night in jail?
And we'd still be there if some dame hadn't bailed us out.
Chick, stop calling Sandra a dame!
I'm tellin' ya, they were there.
Oh, stop.
Two of'em.
One of'em was about eight foot tall.
Way up there!
And he walked like this.
Just like that.
Now, that's the way he walked. Stop it.
You don't believe that? Certainly not!
Well, I saw it.
And the other one, he went like this.
And he kept gettin' closer and closer.
He had eyes that were balls of fire.
He kept staring, eye to eye.
Eye to eye!
Staring!
I never saw anything like it in my life.
Believe me when I tell you
I was scared to death.
Really I was.
I was really scared, Chick.
What's the matter...
Chick?
Oh!
What did I do?
Hey, Chick, I don't like you like that.
Come on, be just like you used to be.
Ah, go away! Atta boy! I'm happy.
That's just like you used to be. Stop this nonsense!
You're Wilbur Gray?
Yes, sir.
Then you must be Chick Young. So what?
I'm Lawrence Talbot. I've been looking all over town for you.
You didn't have to look far.
We were in jail. Yes, I know.
I'm the one who telephoned you not to deliver those bodies.
I knew they were alive! Oh! Oh!
So you thought I was imagining things when
I told you about the fellow eight feet tall... walking with the stiff legs, and the other fellow with this here.
Wait! You're crazy, and so is this screwball!
Look, I have my own troubles.
Worse than you think.
I followed Dracula all the way from Europe... because I believe he's going to try and revive the Frankenstein monster.
We must find him and destroy him before he can do this! Wait a minute.
Go down to the police, tell them you know the story about Dracula and the monster.
They'd be very interested. I can't do that.
Because then I'd have to tell them who I am... and why I know what I know.
Soon...
Soon the moon will rise.
I haven't time to explain.
I've taken the room across the hall. Here's the key. Lock me in!
Lock you in? Yes, please. Hurry!
It's silly, but I'll do it.
He's scared too.
Remember, no matter what you hear or what happens, don't let me out!
"Lock me in. " That guy is screwier than you are.
He is not.
He's a nice man.
He's worried about the police getting him because he knows they're alive.
I'm going to bed.
Well...
Hey, he forgot his bag.
Mr. Talbot, you forgot your grip.
Mr. Talbot?
Mr. Talbot?
Now, how'd he get out of here?
Hmph.
I'll leave him a note.
I left your bag... in the bedroom.
Wilbur.
I wonder if he counted these.
He might've.
Aah!
Maybe he didn't.
A fine insurance company
I'm doing business with!
Outsmarted by a couple of morons!
Those two crooks got out of jail on bail!
We know, Mr. McDougal, but you see we...
In fact, I arranged it. Who are you?
This is Miss Raymond, an investigator from the home office.
It's my job to find those missing exhibits.
I'm sure I can persuade the chubby fellow to lead me right to them.
Naturally I couldn't persuade him very well in jail.
Wilbur, please! I've had nightmares all night long!
I don't want to hear any more about dead bodies. I saw what I saw when I saw it.
All right.
Am I glad to see you.
Will you talk to that guy?
Sandra! Darling, I heard what happened.
That's awful. They can't put my little Wilbur in jail.
They can't, but they did.
Thank you for bailing us out.
I? I only learned about it this morning.
Didn't the policeman tell you a lady bailed us out? He did.
Wilbur, you haven't been untrue to your Sandra?
Sandra, how can you look me in the face and say that?
How can you look him in the face period? Hmph.
I came by to remind you about the masquerade ball tonight.
I was getting ready to pick up my costume.
Come by for me early, dearest. About sunset.
Alone.
Good-bye.
What I'd like to know is, what has he got that I haven't got?
A brain.
Ahh.
A brain.
I'd like to know where it is.
Oh. She forgot to kiss me good-bye.
Mmm! Oh, oh.
Now who is this? She's...
She's... She's beautiful.
I'm Joan Raymond.
She's Joan Raymond.
I'm the girl who arranged your release from jail.
Why should you want to spring us?
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Well! As long as you put it that way, I, uh...
That's what happened to me.
Wilbur, darling!
Miss Raymond, when did this mad feeling first come over you?
The instant I saw you in the baggage room. I knew then that I wanted to spend... every minute that
I'm in town with you.
You did?
What are we doing tonight?
He's going to a masquerade ball.
But, uh,
I'm not doing anything.
- In that case, you'll be lonesome.
- Well, naturally...
Darling, I haven't been to a masquerade ball in ages. I was hoping you'd ask me.
Wilbur!
Come here.
Miss Raymond, will you excuse me?
Oh, you irresistible boy!
Do you want me? Yes, I want you. Come over here.
I just wanted to get a good look at you in the light.
I still don't get it.
Jealous?
Wilbur, I'll have to go out and get a costume.
That's funny.
I was just going too.
I'll go to my room, pick up a couple things and meet you in the lobby.
All right.
In the lobby.
I'll get my hat and coat. I'll be right with you. Excuse me.
Now you've got two dates. What about Sandra, you bigamist?
Sandra? I don't know.
Joan is awful cute.
All right, you takeJoan, I'll take Sandra. Oh, Sandra sends me.
Then I'll takeJoan.
Joan sends me too.
Listen, you sawed-off Romeo, in a minute, I'll send you!
You don't even appeal to me.
Look, Wilbur, we've always been pals, haven't we? Yes.
We've always shared and shared alike, haven't we? Mm-hmm.
Let's be reasonable.
Come on.
I've always shared with you. That you have!
If I had two cigarettes, I'd give you one. That's right.
If I had two pair of shoes, I'd give you a pair. Don't I know that?
And if I have two girls... Well?
Why don't you light that cigarette, put on those shoes and take a walk for yourself?
That's what I'm going to do, but with you.
This key don't fit.
This is Tal...
Talbot's key.
Hey, we forgot about him.
Boy, what a bender he must've been on last night!
Hey, Mr. Talbot.
Mr. Talbot!
And I thought you were such a nice man. Look at yourself.
You're a mess.!
Last night...
I went through another of my horrible experiences.
Years ago I was bitten by a werewolf.
Ever since, when the full moon rises...
I turn into a wolf myself.
Oh, pal, that's all right.
I'm sort of a wolf myself.
And here I thought...
I thought that you were the only one that would believe me, that you were the one that knew I spoke the truth.
You have seen... the living dead.
Mm-hmm.
I came all the way from Europe... because Dracula and the monster must be destroyed.
Together we must find them!
Let's not start that all over again.
I can't go. I've got a date.
In fact, I've got two dates.
But you and I... have a date with destiny.
Let Chick go with destiny.
Won't you please?
Huh?
You kids stay here.
I'm going up and get Sandra.
She's mine too.
Pardon me just a minute.
Wilbur!
Look, you've got Joan and
Sandra. You've got two girls!
How about the two girls we had last week? Let's not talk about that.
You got no kick comin'. You had the best lookin' one. So what?
Yours had teeth.
Yours had teeth too.
Did you see that tooth?
I happened to see it.
Mine had so much bridgework, every time I kissed her I had to pay toll.
What's the use?
Wilbur, can't we both go along too?
Yes, mon amour. That's
Spanish. That's French.
How do you like that? I speak
French too. You cute devil!
Stop that.
Come on, lead the way. Come on.
Hello.
Hello.
Is Sandra in?
Who?
Sandra.
You mean Dr. Mornay?
If that's what she is, I'm just what the doctor ordered.
Come in.
Thank you.
I thought Sandra was your date.
Or did we both come along for the ride? No, no.
Perhaps I should introduce myself. I'm Professor Stevens.
This is Miss Raymond, Wilbur
Gray, and I'm Chick Young.
How do you do, Miss Raymond? How do you do?
I have work to finish, but it shouldn't take more than a few minutes.
Wait in the library. I'll be right down. We're here to pick up Sandra.
Of course. I'm sure she's around somewhere.
Wilbur!
Sandra, hello.
That girl, who is she? Um, mmm...
Uh, she's Chick's date. She's going to the masquerade with us.
I told you to come here alone.
We'll have to get rid of them.
I'll have to get rid of somebody.
Hello, Sandra.
Hello, Chick.
Joan, this is Sandra.
Sandra, Joan.
Nice place you have here, Doctor.
Who told you I was a doctor?
Why, the young man who answered the door.
Oh, Professor Stevens.
I'm on a vacation, you see, and traveling incognito.
What are you doing here? Same thing.
Shall we get going? As soon as I put on my costume.
Would you like to powder your nose? I'd love to.
I'll be right back,
Wilbur.
I'll be right back, too,
Wilbur.
Toodle-oo!
Oh.
Chick, there's a time in everyone's life... when they get in trouble.
I'm in a mess of it now. What's wrong?
I've got two girls.
You know the old saying?
"Everything comes in threes. " Suppose a third girl should fall in love with you?
What's her name? We'll say her name is Mary.
Is she pretty?
Beautiful.
She'd have to be. Now you have Mary, Joan and Sandra.
To prove to you that I'm your pal, your bosom friend,
I'll take one of the girls off your hands.
Chick, you're what I call a real pal. It's all right.
You take Mary.
We better answer that phone.
They're all upstairs. Hello.
Hello?
Is Dr. Lejos there?
Just a minute. Somebody wants to know about a Dr. Lejos. I don't know him.
Hello? Who is this speaking?
This is Wilbur Gray.
I thought I recognized your voice.
This is Talbot speaking.
Listen. I just got a line on Dracula and the monster.
Dr. Lejos has been receiving a lot of electrical equipment, just the type necessary to revive the monster.
So what?
I'm way out on an island.
I've got my own problems.
But listen.
I believe you're in the house of Dracula right now.
You can find the monster, and I'll...
Hello?
Wilbur!
Come here! Chick, you don't know what you're doin'!
What's the matter with you? Shh, quiet. Come here.
- You didn't hang up the phone.
- Let him hang up the phone.
Who? Dracula and the monster live here.
Don't start that again.
Who told you that?
Talbot. He also said we've got to search the place. Come here.
Come over here.
Listen, Talbot, enough is enough. Wilbur's scared...
Hello? Hello? He's gone. So am I.
No, you don't. I'm gonna settle this thing once and for all. We'll search this place.
It's past sunset; and if Dracula is here, he's gonna want breakfast.
And I'm fatter than you, and it ain't gonna be me! Just a minute.
It ain't gonna be me! I'm gonna prove how crazy both you and Talbot are.
We'll search this place, right from the basement.
Chick, we'll search it, you and
I together. Now we're talkin'.
Atta boy. You search the basement,
I'll search outside. No, you don't!
All right, I'll search outside. and you search the basement. That's different.
Mm-hmm-hmm. It worked! Ha-ha! Come on!
Let's look around here.
There's some doors down there.
You think we oughta tell Sandra where we're goin'? Certainly not.
You look over there.
Well?
Broom closet.
Broom closet? Look out. Mm-hmm.
Come on.
Broom closet?
Come on!
Wait for me.
Whoa!
Chick! Open!
Whoa!
Ooh! Chick!
Ahh! Chick!
Ah, Chick!
Aw, stop! It's the truth. Come here.
All I did was like this.
I tell you, right over there. Where are they?
They're in there.
Listen.
Wait. I'm gonna look around.
You go ahead. If I don't find anybody, I'm gonna beat your ears off.
Honest.
They're over there.
Oh, no. I ain't goin' near that place anymore.
Whoa! Ooh!
Open sesame!
Open sesame!
Well, where are they?
They must be in there.
Stop. I'm getting sick and tired of this silly nonsense of yours.
Some guy going around...
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Another guy goin'... Uh! No, no!
The one guy goes...
And the other guy, not like that, like this.
All right.
Put your hands down.
Come on, the girls are waiting for us upstairs.
Have you known Wilbur long?
Yes, we're old friends.
Will you be long?
Just a few minutes.
Miss Raymond?
Yes?
I'm ready.
Shall we go?
Of course.
Here's your purse, dear.
Thank you.
Who screamed?
You did! I did? Ha-ha.
Listen, Wilbur, if you don't stop imagining these crazy things,
I'll take you to a doctor to have you examined.
But I saw them. And when
I see what I see, I saw it.
Mr. Talbot, he saw it too. Talbot!
He's crazy. You're both crazy!
Sandra.
Sandra, I've gotta tell you. I was downstairs in the basement.
Basement? What were you doing down there? I opened the door.
He opened the door and fell down the stairs. Fibber.
How careless.!
You should be careful.!
A person can get killed! I hope you weren't disturbed.
It's perfectly all right.
Introduce me.
This is Miss Raymond.
Mr. Young.
And this is Wilbur.
Ahh, Wilbur!
Why!
I've heard so much about you, I feel as if we have already met.
I must say, my dear, I approve very highly of your choice.
What we need today is young blood.
And brains!
Oh, don't be bashful.
Come.
Hello, Dr. Lejos. I've been looking for you all day.
Every time I ask Dr. Mornay what that equipment is going to be used for, she says to ask you.
Of course.
Didn't I hear that you were going to masquerade ball?
Yes, we have our costumes in the boat. Oh, you young people!
Making the most of life... while it lasts.
Thank you.
Professor, you worked hard and well.
Why don't you join them, and save your questions until tomorrow?
Under ordinary circumstances I'd say no, but... if you don't mind?
Not at all. Good. I'll get my coat.
Of course that would make too many for one boat.
But if the professor and this lady and gentleman go on ahead,
Wilbur and Dr. Mornay can... I'm afraid I can't.
What's the matter? I've suddenly developed a splitting headache.
I'm sorry, Wilbur, but you'll have to go without me.
Nonsense! It will pass as quickly as it came.
It's no use, Doctor. I shall have to go directly to bed.
Pardon me. Well, Chick, there goes your date.
What was that all about?
This is too dangerous. The girl is an insurance investigator.
Stevens is asking too many questions.
Wilbur was up to something in the basement. We ought to wait.
And jeopardize the success of the operation? Never!
I must warn you, my dear Sandra, I am accustomed to having my orders obeyed, especially by women with a price on their heads.
Don't try to scare me,
Count Dracula.
Here. The Secrets of Life and Death by Dr. Frankenstein.
Memorize them. Operate yourself, if you're in such a hurry.
I have other ways of securing your cooperation.
You're wasting your time. My will is as strong as yours.
Are you sure?
Look into my eyes.
Look!
Deeper.
Tell me what you see.
Joan, Chick and I are gonna go into the lockers and change into our costumes.
Come on, Professor. We'll meet you on the dance floor.
Okay.
What did I do?
What do you mean?
He's dancing with my girl! So what?
I'll show her!
I'm in love
Aw, come on. Pick up those bundles! Let's get dressed.
So, it's you!
He knows me!
McDougal! Listen, fat boy, where are my exhibits?
Leave him alone! Not until he tells me where those exhibits are.
Where are they?
Where are they?
Aha! McDougal, now we've got it on you.
You put us in jail. Now we'll have you arrested for assault and battery.
See what good it'll do ya.
You haven't got a witness.
I'm a witness! My word's as good as yours!
Your word is better than his. Keep outta this.
I'll get a witness.
Do me a favor.
Will you watch this?
I need a witness.
Go ahead. I'd like to see you do it again.
Did you see it?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't see a thing.
Thank you.
Have you seen Chick Young or Wilbur Gray?
Seen them?
I don't even know them.
I've got to know what they found on that island.
Chick! Wilbur! What did you find? Was I right?
No! And I wish you'd stop trying to put those ideas in this boy's head.
He's not used to them.
Go put your things on.
Did you meet Dr. Lejos? Yes.
What did he look like? Tall, aristocratic, a faraway look in his eye?
All I know is he told us to go out and have some fun. Why don't you?
Can't I convince you that Dracula is a very dangerous person?
You and Wilbur are just trying to scare me. Well, it won't work!
I scared ya.
I scared ya, you big sissy. This is your mask.
No, no, no. Please don't wear that. What's the matter?
I know you'll think
I'm crazy, but... in a half an hour the moon will rise and I'll turn into a wolf.
You and 20 million other guys. Listen!
I might tear you limb from limb! Is that serious?
He'll murder ya.!
That's serious.
It won't be if you'll just take me and lock me in my room.
Please.
Oh, all right.
Why don't you hire yourself a keeper?
Come on.
Hey!
Look.
Oh, Sandra's coming.
Is it all clear?
I will take care of the girl.
And you'll take Wilbur back to the castle.
Understand?
Yes, master.
Sandra, you look...
So... we meet again,
Count Dracula.
Dracula? Yes. That's who he says you are.
Oh, my costume perhaps. No, Talbot thinks you're the real thing.
Out of McDougal's
House of Horrors.
What an odd hallucination.
But the human mind is often inflamed with strange complexes.
I suggest you consult your physician, Mr. Talbot.
And take him along with you, please.
So there you are!
I'm glad to see you've recovered.
I didn't expect to see you here,
Doctor. Sandra insisted I come.
I need a little relaxation. Miss
Raymond, would you honor me with a dance?
No. No!
I warn you.
He is Count Dracula!
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Let me tell you... while we dance.
Pardon me, Mr. Talbot.
Sandra, do you feel all right?
Of course. But I must obey my doctor's orders.
Oh, sure! You gotta do what the doctor tells ya.
I intend to.
Let's have a walk, Wilbur.
Toodle-oo.
Professor, do you understand women?
I don't even try.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Sit here.
Sandra, there's something strange about ya. You're not yourself.
Is there anything I can do to help? Yes.
I want you to go away with me to the island.
Just me and you?
Yes.
I want to be the only one in your life. I want to be part of you.
I want to be in your blood.
I think I know what you mean.
Wouldn't you want a prettier fellow than me? No. I want no one but you.
You are so full-blooded, so round, so firm.
So fully packed. And I want to stay that way.
Aah!
Stuck myself.
I'm bleedin'.
Let me see it.
Uh-uh. There ain't enough for the two of us... if that's what you're thinking.
I'll tell you what I'm thinking. Look into my eyes.
I'm afraid to. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Look. Deeper.
Deeper!
Deeper.
I looked deep enough.
I don't wanna look anymore.
Of course you do.
Don't you know what's going to happen now? I'll bite.
Oh, no... I will!
Wilbur.! Wilbur.!
Joan.!
Joan? There he is.
Wilbur, have you seen Joan?
No, but I have definitely made up my mind.
You can have Sandra, but make sure you've got plenty of bandages.
Maybe Dracula lured Joan into the woods.
Chick, do you know what could happen if I meet Dracula in the woods?
I'll bite. Oh, no. You gotta stand in line.
Let's not waste any time. Yeah, let's.
Joan? Joan?
Joan!
Chick, we can't find her.
Let's keep on looking. Come on. Joan!
Joan?
Aw, Chick, we're never gonna find her.
Joan!
Joan?
Joan?
Joan?
Joan.!
Joan.!
Chick? Chick?
Where did he go?
Chick!
I'm gettin' tired of lookin' forJoan.
Look at him.
Didn't Mr. Talbot tell you not to put that mask on?
What'd you put it on for?
Take the mask off!
Come on!
Joan?
Chick, what are you lookin' in there for? You're not gonna find Joan in there.
Now, come on, get up! Get up! We gotta find Joan.
Come on, Chick.
Now, take that mask off!
Take it easy.
I'm your friend!
Help.! Help.!
Help.!
The man's been hurt. Looks like something attacked him.
Get a doctor.
You'll be all right, though another half inch would have severed your jugular vein.
Get him up.
Who did it? It was somebody in a wolf's mask.
McDougal, what happened to you?
You! It was you! He said he was gonna get me. Me?
That's right. I saw him arguing with you earlier this evening.
That's ridiculous.
I wouldn't...
People, real live people.
That's a boy. Tell 'em.
Chick, what's the idea of trying to take a bite out of me?
What's the idea? What, did he take a bite out of you too?
What's the matter? You gone mad? Wilbur!
Don't let that little fellow fool you. He's an accomplice.
Me?
Let's call the sheriff.
Chick! Chick!
Oh, Chick!
Chick!
Joan, Joan, come on.
We gotta get outta here.
Joan?
Joan? Don't tell me you've gone bats too.
Wilbur.! Wilbur.!
Wilbur.!
Chick! Chick!
Chick, Chick.
Quiet. They're after me. After you? What for?
McDougal was almost killed last night by either a wolf... or a man wearing a mask of a wolf!
It was a wolf.
I'm going to give myself up.
It's the only way to clear you.
Then... you were on the level about that wolf business?
Yes. I'm going to surrender. You can't do that!
Dracula's taken Wilbur and Joan to the island. Are you sure?
I saw what I saw when I saw it!
Hurry! Follow me!
They may come back.
But Dracula?
Dracula is helpless until after nightfall. Maybe by then we'll...
Okay. But after what I saw there'd better not be any maybe.
Sandra. Sandra?
Sandra.!
Junior?
Junior.
Will you help me get outta here?
Sandra!
Junior.
Shall we begin?
I've been waiting, master.
Sandra? Sandra?
He's growing weaker! Will he respond to the operation?
If the generators are kept going. We must start immediately.
I'll get rid of Stevens, and you'll take care of him.
Sandra, what are you gonna do?
Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you. Thank you.
Soon, instead of being short and chubby, you'll be big and tall and as strong as an ox.
And furthermore, you'll live forever and never grow old.
Oh, Sandra, you still love me.
But, Sandra, how are you gonna do all these things? By a simple operation.
I shall remove your brain and put it in his body.
You're gonna take my brain and put it in Junior's body? Yes.
Ha-ha! For a minute, I didn't know how you were gonna do it!
Agh!
Good evening, Professor.
Is everything under control?
Everything but my temper.
I found Miss Raymond in Dr. Mornay's room.
You should mind your own business, Professor.
I also found this, which is very much my business.
And after I've taken Joan back to town, I'm...
Hmm. Excellent.
Let's take him to the cellar. We can dispose of all the bodies at the same time.
Well, there's the boat.
Let's look around.
Hey, that must be the entrance to the castle.
Come on.
Come.
Lie down... here.
Yes... master.
Frankie, don't let 'em do it to ya.
Frankie boy.
Listen to me, Frankie.
Don't let 'em do it to ya!
Frankie. Frankie! I'm tellin' ya, it's a bad deal.
I've had this brain for 30 years and it hasn't worked right yet.
Ask me how much one and one is, Frankie. Go ahead, ask me.
I don't know.
We'll be right back, Wilbur.
Okay, I'll wait.
Chick! Dracula is Dracula! Wilbur!
Sandra's gonna use my brain to make a bigger dummy out of the other dummy.
I'll get you out of this.
No kiddin'! Hurry up.
All right.
Atta boy.
Does it hurt? No, no. Go ahead, a little harder.
What's the matter? All right,
I'm doing the best I can!
Wait a minute.
Oh, pardon me, I'm sorry.
There you are. Now, get outta here. Go ahead.
Hey, not that way.
To the left!
Get him out.
Get him out!
No door. No door? Come on, get outta here!
Take it easy, you'll be all right.
We gotta get back to the castle. Joan's in there. Come on.
Come on, Wilbur. Not me.
I'm not goin' back in there.
I've got too much of what they want: brains.
Get the motor started in the boat. Hurry up. Okay.
They've escaped!
You attend to the monster. I can handle our fat friend. Come.
Wilbur.
Come back.
Come.
I said... come back!
Come!
Wilbur! We're all set.
You got the boat...
Wilbur!
He's not here!
Now where'd he go?
Look!
They started the operation.
They must've found him.
We've gotta go back.
You stay here with Joan.
Please... give me a little ether.
We don't need it.
You won't feel a thing.
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you!
Get me off here.
What are you lookin'out the window for? Somebody else comin'after me?
Hmm?
Hey!
Chick, help! Please!
Chick.!
Chick! Chick!
Oh, Chick!
Aah, Chick.!
Chick!
Aah!
Back.
Back!
Chick!
Come on!
Chick, do you believe me now? Yes.
Hurry up.
Let's barricade the door.
Get it over there.
Okay, come on.
There.
Put your shoulder to the door. Hold it tight.
We barricaded it.
He can't get in here!
Come on, Wilbur!
Come on!
Help!
Back.
Back.
Back.
Yes... master.
He thinks I'm Dracula.
Whew!
Well, we got him!
Joan! Joan!
Are you all right?
Mm-hmm.
I gotcha. You're just the one we're lookin' for. Still want your exhibits?
Of course I do. Here comes one of'em now!
Aah!
Chick!
Come on, Wilbur!
Fill that bucket with gas.
Untie the boat.
Untie the boat!
Untie the boat, will ya?
Untie the boat, will ya please?
Okay!
He won't chase us anymore.
And another thing.
The next time I tell you that
I saw something when I saw it, you believe me that I saw it! Oh, relax.
Now that we've seen the last of
Dracula, the Wolfman and the Monster, there's nobody to frighten us anymore.
That's too bad. I was hoping to get in on the excitement.
Who said that? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the Invisible Man.
- That's my job, trying the doors.
- So it is, my friend, so it is.
Who want bring a sailor out on a night like this?
A buried treasure, my friend, a buried treasure.
I think you've had a nip too much, you better run along now and let...
- the night air sober you up.
- Drunk I am not but that's an idea.
Do you know where a Mr. Bill Martin might be?
Well, you might try pier 5, he's usually down there with his... pal and their boat, the Skiddoo.
I have some news for him, rare and interesting news.
I got it.
If I could only figure out some way so that they didn't have to sew him up.
It's worth a million dollars, condensed stuffing for Christmas turkeys.
- Well, they can beer, don't they?
- Yeah, they can beer.
Oh, why don't we give this whole business up and get ourselves jobs like other people?
Oh, now Stuff, you don't want to spoil a beautiful record, do you?
Two thirds of my class have been out of work since I left Princeton.
Do you mind if I get a job? I didn't go to college.
Oh Stuff, you're not losing confidence in the old Bill Martin system, are you?
- How can it miss?
- How can it miss?
Remember all of your other ideas? They couldn't miss either.
Sometimes you have to have
Patience, you have to wait.
Wait? Yeah.
While we're waiting around, will you tell me how 8 bucks is going to take care of these?
Here, back rent on the store, three months' payments on this boat.
There's only one thing to do.
File them with the rest of our bills.
- Help, help...
- That must be one of our creditors.
Help.
Stuff, grab a wrench.
- Hey you, stop right there.
- I don't know, this thing ain't loaded.
- Pull me up, pull me up.
- There he is.
Catch hold, attaboy.
There you go.
- Fine, take it easy.
- My leg, my leg, my leg, my leg.
- Take it easy.
- Look, his leg is gone.
- I'll fix a tourniquet.
- Yeah, sure.
Is there, there she blows, aport the rim.
Look, it's a wooden leg.
Haul her in, smack her out, step lively before she score herself.
- Hey, go quick before she drifts off to sea.
- He'll get it.
I'm a hero.
I would rather lose my good one than that one, eh?
Solid mahogany, I carve it myself out of an old piano.
Very musical, every time someone play the spring song... it gets a touch of sciatica or rheumatism.
- He got it all right.
- Who got what?
- The phantom.
- Eh?
Hey, you are not in cahoots with this phantom, eh?
We've been cahoots with a lot of people but never any phantom, who is he?
How you know is a phantom?
All phantom look alike to me.
So, a phantom hits you over the head... took all your money and threw your leg into the harbor, eh?
Yeah, he didn't get my money, only got half the map, I was too smart for him.
They must read a lot of fiction on ship board.
The half he got was in here, but I'm telling where the other half is.
Not till I see that fellow, what's his name? Bill Martin.
Bill Martin?
Well, he's got a shop right...
Oh, oh that's him.
You? You are Bill Martin?
The laddie what own the Morgan island, eh?
Yeah.
Then I'll have big business deal to chew over with you.
That is if you want to cut in on half of the 20 million?
- 20 million?
- Do you mean in cash?
In gold and jewels.
20 million, I am telling you.
Hey, we better get him out of here, he's out of his head.
Spanish gold with pieces of eight, and royal jewels, I'm telling you.
And there we was, for fishing off of the Bahamas.
We was wrestling on our oars when up pops the cask, right under our bows.
Well, there was nothing for me to do, so I pull him in.
Must've been drifting for 200 years.
200 years, I am telling you.
It was all covered with barnacles.
I rip him open and what you think I find, eh?
- Oh, now don't tell me a mermaid?
- No, no, no mermaid, not this time.
Give me my leg, you'll be surprised.
This map, the half that the phantom did not get.
Now tell me laddie, do we be partners, eh?
Wait a minute, let's take a look at it.
- Now, where did he go?
- You got me.
- What you do? Let him get away?
- I'm sorry skipper, I did my best.
If I would've had two good legs, I would catch him myself.
Yeah.
- Are you looking for somebody?
- Why, yes.
- I'm looking for William Martin.
- You mean Bill Martin?
- Yes.
- Well, he's...
He, he's out of town for a few weeks.
Can I give him a message for you?
No, this is something personal.
- Thanks just the same.
- Oh, it's all right.
- You, you are not Bill Martin?
- Yeah, what's the idea?
Hey listen Stuff, how many times do I've to tell you?
When anybody looks for me, I'm not here. That guy is a Bill collector if I ever saw one.
After we get the 20 million, you won't have no bills bothering you no more.
But you should not have let the phantom get away from you.
We might need the other half of that map.
Listen, next time you chase your own phantoms, come on.
20 million dollars, maps, gold, deserted islands, castles...
Hey, look.
- He's come back, the phantom.
- Well, he won't get away this time.
I am coming laddie.
- Hold it there a second Bill.
- I got him.
- Get a hold of him Bill.
- Hold him laddie.
Let me out of this.
- Hey, this isn't any phantom.
- You know this one?
Sure, it's my cousin George.
George, wake up, wake up.
I'll wake him up.
- Thanks for waking him up.
- Well, I just...
You always give you relatives this kind of a welcome?
George, if I'd known you were coming, I couldn't have done any better.
Yeah, well I'm not exactly glad to see you either.
- This isn't a social call.
- No? Then what do you want?
I want to get dry.
Cousin or no cousin, he was after Morgan's map.
Who? Him?
No, he doesn't collect maps, he collects etchings.
I hear you haven't been doing so well lately Bill.
No.
Well, thought I might help you out.
You?
- Yeah, tell me, have you been...
- Excuse me.
Have you sold the old Morgan island yet?
No, it's about the only thing in grandfather's will that I couldn't hawk.
Well, thought I might take if off your hands.
That doesn't sound like you George, come again.
Well, the truth of the matter is, I've been thinking about fixing up the old castle.
You know, hideaway for weekends?
Well, you know, I've sort of got attached to the old place.
I'll give you 20,000 dollars for it.
- 20 thou...
Well, that does sound reasonable enough George.
Coming from anybody else,
I might consider it.
Oh, what's the difference who it comes from??
Tell him you'll take it.
Don't do it laddie, he's after Morgan's gold.
Well, how about it?
Sorry George but I can't handle it.
I'll be back in a few days to see if you've changed your mind.
- You're wasting your time.
- We'll see.
You just kicked 20,000 dollars right in the teeth, are you nuts?
You are a man among men laddie, when do we start?
- Start, start where?
- For the treasure, remember?
You know, I would not be surprised if he was the phantom trying to get there ahead of us.
Maybe you're right skipper.
I can't understand this sudden interest of cousin George.
20,000 crackers.
Let's get started, the sooner the quicker, come.
Oh, wait a minute, you haven't proved anything yet.
Prove? Here's this map.
What more do you want, eh?
- Look.
- How do we know that map is genuine?
Genuine? I will show you.
Well, there is a way to find out.
It's amazing, positively amazing.
- You mean that it's on the level?
- On the level?
- Oh, you mean authentic.
- Oh, what we want to know, is it real?
No, no, of course it's not authentic.
But it's one of the most skillfully made imitations I've ever seen.
Imitation? What you talking about?
I fished that out of the ocean myself.
It was probably some tourist on a boat indulging in a bit of whimsy.
Made the map and tossed it into the ocean.
What he know, that land lubber? I'm telling you, that is the map of sir Henry Morgan.
That's strange, that's exactly what the other man said.
What other man?
Who he was?
Gentlemen gentlemen, you overwhelm me,
I'm just looking up a reference for you.
Who he was and what do he want?
It was just the man with the other half of the map.
What did he look like?
Oh, I couldn't say exactly. He was very tall and somewhat foreign looking.
- What did you tell him?
- The same thing I told you.
- The map is unquestionably a fake.
- Fake.
I couldn't convince him of that either, but then I'm accustomed to that.
So many people come in here with worthless treasure maps.
You mean other people fall for this buried treasure Stuff?
Why, literally hundreds.
- I got an idea, come on.
- Where you going?
- To make ourselves a fortune.
- Here we go again.
♪ 15 men on a dead man's chest, yee-ho, yee-ho... ♪
♪ Pirates made him walk the plank, yee-ho and a bottle of rum. ♪
Everything all set?
Well, I think I got everything all set, let's see.
I got plaster skulls to put under the covers, copper cords I found in the desk in store.
Spanish beads and a dozen maps, positively fake.
Ain't he a cutie?
Yeah, he ought to give the customers a thrill.
- Customers?
- That's a laugh.
The only customers we've got is that one leg... and he's gone over to the island on the cuff.
What's the matter? You losing faith in my million dollar ideas?
I got more faith in your 20,000 dollars cousin.
Wait till the customers get a load of this...
Treasure hunt, bookkeeper finds fortune, why don't you?
Finders keepers, don't delay, call today.
Join our weekend excursion to Morgan's island.
50 dollars per person, covers all expenses.
Buried Treasure Incorporated, 227
Front Street. Bill Martin, general manager.
- Well, how do you like it?
- Oh, it's all right.
But if you want get them ghosts installed by Saturday, you better help me get... this down to the boat so we can get started.
How do you do?
- I just want to inquire if...
- I'm sorry, he's not here.
Oh, haven't any idea where he might be, have you?
- Yes, he went fishing.
- Oh, it's too bad.
Oh, what did you want to see him about?
Maybe I could tell him when he gets back.
Well, it's confidential government business.
- But we'll find him, sorry I troubled you.
- Oh, no trouble at all.
Say, sounds like income tax to me, you never can tell what they're going to dig up.
I don't like the way he said, we'll find him.
Come on, make it snappy, I got to get back here.
Oh, what we waiting for?
- What happened?
- Go back to sleep, I'll handle this.
Why don't you look where you're going lady?
- I thought so, a man driving.
- Well, you're not so hot yourself.
- Where's your driver's license?
- Where's yours?
- I don't suppose you're insured?
- Certainly not, I never touch the stuff.
Well, who's going to pay for the damages to my car?
Damages? A little paint scraped off, that's all.
- Besides, you were doing 60.
- 70, perhaps you'd like to see my lawyer?
Now, relax, my man here will take care of everything.
Sure, all we have to do is unhook these fenders, straighten this lamp out.
I think it'll be cheaper if you let me have it fixed.
- It just dropped off.
- Where shall I send the bill?
Now, wait a minute, how do you think it'll be?
Well, if you call your man off right away, you might get by 200 dollars.
Listen, I don't want to buy this heap.
Perhaps you'd like to settle this thing in court?
That's all right with me lady.
My card.
- Rhumba lessons, eh?
- Wrong one.
- Escorts and, you certainly get around.
- That's the wrong too.
Buried Treasure
Incorporated, 227 Front Street.
- Why, that's right...
- Right here.
Come on in the office, we'll settle everything.
Hey Stuff, get unhooked there and get over to the island.
Right.
Here, hold this, will you?
Somebody give me a hand here, will you?
- Say, that man, that fellow is dead.
- I only look dead, go away.
Well, that's mighty trim craft you got here, eh? You mind if I check your compass?
Look, I take an aspirin, will you go away?
You know, I'm going to have to speak to that assistant of mine...
- he's mislaid my checkbook again, then...
- Mister, who do you think you're kidding?
Well, I don't know her name but she's kind of cute.
Skip it, I'm interested in the damages to my car.
Well, could I mail you a check?
Yes, you could, if you put in writing that you owe me the money.
It's as good as done, where is it go?
- Wendy Creighton, East End Yacht Club.
- Wendy Creighton?
Say, you're the girl that owns the Jamboree.
- I see you know your yacht registrations.
- Well, now look miss Creighton.
With all your dough, you're going to let a couple of measly hundreds... dollars stand in the way of a beautiful friendship?
That's why we have our money, we don't mix friendship with business.
Business? You know, that puts a new light on the subject.
Why don't you get away?
Yachts, motorcars, boring social activities?
And take a trip to
Morgan's island, I suppose?
That's right, how you guess it?
Me on a phony trip like that?
No thank you, I've seen everything.
Come in, come in.
- Suppose we leave everything to mister...
- Thurman Coldwater is the name and... if you want to leave anything to me, I'll accept it.
Think of it, riches, ghosts.
A haunted castle on a deserted island.
- How is that sound to you?
- Positively boring.
You wouldn't deprive this poor girl of an exciting adventure on Morgan's Island?
Listen, my impetuous young friend... nothing ever deprives this young lady of anything she sets her mind to.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm awfully tired.
You know, your high pressure doesn't startle me either, it's still no sale.
Alright, I'll come clean.
I haven't got the money to pay you now but I will have, after our first trip.
Oh, why didn't you say that in the first place?
Well, after all I did get your name and address.
But seriously, if you come with us... and you say that it isn't the most thrilling adventure that... you ever had, I'll pay you double what I owe you and if you don't, well, we're even.
Your powers of persuasion are overwhelming but still going to cost you 200 dollars more.
Maybe.
Alright, now don't forget the boat leaves Saturday at 2 o'clock, pier 5.
Here your tickets.
Still small voice tells me
I'm crazy but come Thurman.
In spite of what I've told you about the map, you still believe there's treasure there?
Why not? You know nothing about your pirate history?
Yes, I'll have to admit that sir Henry Morgan and his... men once used the island for a hideaway.
That they did and wherever there is pirates, there is treasure.
- You know, I might enjoy that trip.
- Well, you only live once.
I'd have to sell my baby barns, but after all, it is adventure, isn't it?
Why don't you in?
I think I will,
There's something fishy about this, why should you want to go?
After your customers yell for their money back, maybe I can persuade you to sell.
I'm sorry George... but I'm afraid you'll have to wait until
I die before you get a hold of the castle.
I'll still be young enough to enjoy it then, how much?
50 bucks, payable in advance.
How do you do?
You're going to be with us, I hope.
It's a nice day for a sail and you'll enjoy it, I'm sure, just think of it. Ghosts...
- riches, thrills, a haunted castle on the...
- Yeah, yeah, I know. 100 bucks.
Yeah, that's right.
- Alright Stuff, get the bags.
- You bet.
Make ready to shove off men, right this way, folks.
Just follow me please.
Right in here folks.
Hey, wait a minute. Hey, just a minute.
You happen to be Bill Martin?
- See me later bud, I'm busy.
- Just a minute bub, hold on just a minute.
My name is Mcgoon, I'm private investigator for the Merchants Protective Association.
We don't want anything today.
You're guilty of false and misleading advertising.
- Eh?
- Your ad says that you got ghosts.
Yes and they all got union cards.
But the Merchants Protective
Association don't believe in ghosts.
Skeptics, eh?
I got a little court order here for you to cease and desist.
Well, now wait a minute sergeant, when you make a serious accusation like this...
- you have to have some proof.
- Eh?
Well, how can you prove that there aren't any ghosts when you haven't been there?
- Oh?
- Well, you're familiar with law sergeant?
Well, I didn't get this out of a bag of popcorn...
Then you know that you got to have legal proof.
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, then why don't you take a little trip with us over to the... island and see the ghosts for yourself?
Who, me?
Yes, we have a special reduced rate for members of the profession, 75 dollars.
- 75 bucks?
- You can put it on your expense account.
- You think they let me get away with that?
- Certainly, they would and you'll love it.
Genial company, old world atmosphere, you can pay me later, shoving off.
Well, we're on our way. I.
Ahoy there, aboard the Skiddoo.
Gone for the weekend.
- I got a package for you.
- What is it?
I don't know, the guy says to give it to you personally, said it's important.
- Well, toss is over.
- Alright, stand by, here she comes.
- Butter fingers.
- What an outfielder?
Full speed astern.
Young man, where would
I find the boat Skiddoo?
Just did.
- I'm trying to locate William Martin.
- I just saw him aboard.
I delivered a package to him but he never got it, there it is.
Oh my.
Well, for a send off, that wasn't bad.
It sure looks like somebody don't want us to get to that island.
Will the rest of your thrills be that noisy Mr. Martin?
Oh lovely idea this, a lovely idea.
- This is all deluxe, the 100 dollar special.
- Why didn't we take your yacht?
- Say listen bud.
- Mr. Coldwater, if you please.
Alright Mr. coldwater...
The trip includes taking my boat, not hers.
It ain't your boat either, it belongs to the finance company.
Excuse me Mr. Icewater.
Well, is it my fault if somebody puts a magnet in the compass... and we've been going in the wrong direction for six hours?
Oh, what are you all complaining about? This is exciting, it's adventure.
Imagine, lost at sea, on the way to a haunted island, with a ghost castle where one of us might even be murdered.
What if it's you professor?
It might as well be me, the way I feel.
Must've been something you ate, what you eat?
Oh, I only had some lobster and some strawberry ice cream and a couple of beers.
- It couldn't be that.
- It couldn't have been.
Captain, let the ship burn, I'm staying right here.
I saw you give that guy a tumble when we came on board.
Now, lay off.
Why don't we settle this thing and get it over with?
Shut up.
- Alright but don't say I didn't warn you.
- I said, shut up.
Hey, land on the port bow.
Must be a mirage.
Wherever we are, let's land and thumb a ride.
Well, this is it folks, get ready to land.
Alright folks, pick up your bag. I'm not responsible for anything left after 30 days.
- Walk, not run, for the nearest castle.
- You either have to be funny or quieter.
Alright skipper, step forward.
This castle is over 400 years old.
- Fine thing, no red taps.
- So this is Morgan's castle?
Yeah and is been deserted for hundreds of years.
Oh, double doors, I suppose bats fly out when you open them.
Well, they're there.
- Look out, bats.
- They scourge you.
Bats, my aunt Emma, they were pigeons.
Can somebody tell me why lobsters don't like beer?
Hey Stuff, I thought I told you to get bats?
Oh, where was I going to get bats? Besides, them pigeons ain't worked in six months.
Alright folks.
Put down your baggage and make yourselves comfortable.
There is treasure here,
I can feel it in my bones.
- That is your rheumatism.
- We shall see my friend, we shall see.
This place gives me the heebie-jeebies, reminds me of a prison.
Will you forget that line of chatter?
I think you've waited too long already, why can't we start now?
Can't make a move until all these people get to sleep.
Rod, don't make a fool of yourself.
This is going to be an unhealthy trip for one of you two.
That...
Don't be frightened folks, it's just Morgan's ghost.
- He resents our coming here.
- Not anymore than I do.
That treasure, she must be in this wall someplace.
Look out.
Are you hurt?
No but look at this harpoon, it could have killed a whale.
That's a cute little plaything.
Well, there's nothing to be excited about folks.
This thing is probably been set for years, we must've jogged the mechanism.
- First mechanical man, eh?
- That's right.
In the old days, when the castle was short of... defenders, they put a few dozen of these to work.
I'll soon have it nice and cheerful in here.
♪ 15 men on a dead man... ♪
- Hey Stuff...
Lay off shooting those arrows, you almost killed the skipper.
Arrows, what arrows?
I ain't been shooting no arrows.
Yeah, I know but lay off just the same.
- Mustn't touch, employees only.
- Ok Bluebeard.
- Playing games, eh?
- I'm sorry, that thing almost hit you.
Boy, that was close.
A ghost, a ghost pushed that statue.
- My vibrations tell me.
- That one had muscles.
Yes and I think I know the ghost's name.
Aren't you boys carrying this thing a little too far?
Hey now Stuff, enough, it's too much, you might've killed her.
Ah, I didn't do this, he must've just fell over.
Yes but... alright folks, I guess that's enough excitement for one night... if you come up, I'll assign you to your rooms.
It was midnight in the old deserted castle.
The dreaded hour when the monster had threatened to strike.
Gloria Valgene shivered... even though it was a warm night and she was curled up before a raging fire.
Hello Yarik, find your own bed.
The evening is still young.
I say you're putting everybody to bed but in my case... you're extending a special privilege in letting me stay up.
Good night.
If that wasn't the wind, don't do it again.
Leave the castle, leave the castle.
You just wasting your time Bill, why don't you go to bed?
This castle belongs to the spirits of the past.
- Leave before morning.
- You do any other dialects?
Death waits for those who dare to spend the night here.
Well, I'm going to bed Bill, call me at seven.
This is your last warning, you must leave here at once.
Bill, you're not scaring me.
If you are wise, you will do what I tell you.
Now look Bill, this scare act was a joke up till now but coming into a girl's...
You alright?
- He stood right there.
- Who?
A figure in a black cape and a horrible face.
- You mean you were scared?
- I was scared to death.
That makes us even, the repair bill of your car is paid in full.
- Did you folks hear somebody scream?
- I did the screaming.
Brother, did you know that you have a horrible face?
Eh?
- Where you get the black cape?
- Black cape?
- Oh but it wasn't his face that I saw.
- No.
- No, I ain't been near this room tonight.
- You haven't?
I've been downstairs fixing,
I mean, doing some work.
Are you still frightened?
I've to admit you boys did a good job of it.
You got me frightened so badly, now I don't want to stay in this room a minute longer.
Well, how would you feel if we fixed a nice cozy bed for you down by the fire?
Anywhere where I don't have to be alone.
Is this party going on all night?
- Radios playing and dames screaming.
- Shut up and sit down.
- When do we get started?
- I'll tell you when.
Look, a bunch of nitwits.
Nothing else to do but play games.
Quit yelling.
What do you want to do?
Bring them all in here?
I know what I want to do and I'm going to do it right now, I'm leaving.
You're leaving when I tell you to leave.
You're going to do this once too often.
I'm afraid you're doomed to be successful.
- You really think I've possibilities?
- Sure, look at all this.
For a thrill, I'm going to recommend it to all my friends.
Well, the gadget man here really deserves most of the credit.
Do you mind a little criticism?
No, the management appreciates any suggestion to improve the service.
Yeah, yeah, suggest ahead.
Well, number one. Don't barge into a lady's room without knocking.
Number two, don't tell your guests to leave the castle.
I don't understand that either, what you do that for?
I didn't.
Oh, the first thing I heard over the loud speaker in my room was an eerie voice saying, leave the castle, leave the castle.
Well, that wasn't me.
I ain't been near that microphone since I let out with that first moan.
Leave the castle.
Leave the castle.
That's it, that's the voice.
See? That ain't me, is it?
I'm right here, ain't I?
Or am I?
You going to be gone long?
Hey Stuff, somebody is getting a little playful.
Stay here with Wendy and
I'll see if I can find out who it is.
Stay right there professor, I'm going to take a look at some of our guests.
This way professor.
Wait right there.
I'll tuck you in professor but remember, this going to cost you extra.
What you find out?
Well, everybody is accounted for except the skipper, he's not in his room.
The skipper?
You don't think he'd be running around, scaring everybody and...
- telling us to leave the castle, do you?
- Maybe.
You know Stuff, maybe he'd like to look for the treasure all by himself.
- Hey, is that another one of your gags?
- No.
Maybe it's the skipper.
- Let's go see.
- If we just ignored it, it might go away.
Come on.
Spooky, ain't it?
We ought to have some light down here.
- Getting warmer.
- That's what you think.
- Where's the boat?
- I told you we waited too long.
Must've drifted someplace.
Whatever that noise was, it's gone.
Somebody killed him.
What's the matter? What's the matter? What's going on?
Somebody killed Rod.
- Who done it?
- I don't know.
We were looking around for the boat.
We heard a noise, Rod turned,
I heard a shot and he folded up.
And a guy in a black cape ran into the bushes.
Say, what you doing with this gun?
- I took from Rod.
- Then you shot him.
No, no, I didn't. I took a shot at the man in the black cape.
A very likely story sister, you're coming along with me.
- I ain't talking till I see a lawyer.
- Don't argue, come on.
Hey Stuff...
What do you make of this?
I don't know.
- What do you figure it is?
- Marks made by a peg leg.
The skipper.
Mcgoon would say it's open and shut.
Oh no, the skipper wouldn't do nothing like that.
Why not?
Who else is got a peg leg around here?
Besides, we don't know very much about him.
What we going to do? Turn him over to Mcgoon?
Don't you think we better find him first?
Eh? Oh, yeah.
So, that's it, eh? That's it?
Your name is Grady Mrs. Grady.
The wife of killer Grady, the bank bandit.
Sure, the whole state was looking for him, now do you do get the idea?
Yeah, yeah, no.
They were watching all the buses and trains... so we decided to steal a boat and beat it out of the country.
Oh, you were going to cop the boat and you were going to help him to escape.
Don't you know that that's a criminal offense?
- He was forcing me to do it.
- So, you killed him.
No, no, no, no,
I didn't, I tell you, I didn't do it.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. You did admit that you fired this gun, didn't you?
- Yes.
- How many times?
Once, at the man in the black cape who killed Rod.
That's right. I remember,
I remember there were two shots.
Then there ought to be six slugs in this, we'll soon find out.
- How do you work this thing?
- Like that.
Yeah, I know but how do you get the slugs out?
You just pull this down and pull this out.
One, two... three, four... five, six.
Well sister, you got me there but I ain't giving up yet.
- Why not?
- Oh hello hello.
What do you mean why not?
There's a substantial reward for killer Grady, dead or alive.
Yeah, that's right, well, what about it?
All you have to do is turn in the body and claim the reward.
That's right.
Say, what do you expect to get out of this?
Oh, don't worry about me.
This is a treasure hunt, you know.
- Well sister, I'm going let you go.
- That's awfully sweet of you pal.
Yeah but you just stick around where I can keep my eye on you.
Sure.
I'm not quite convinced about this whole thing yet, I'll take charge of these.
Oh, I forgot all about you.
- How did I get here, what happened?
- You walking in your sleep.
Oh dear me.
We didn't want you falling downstairs and getting hurt, so we tied you up.
Seems to me, somebody wants us on this island but dead.
Oh, don't be silly Stuff, somebody just wanted rod out of the way.
- But who?
- I found it mates, I found it.
- Found what?
- The key to the buried treasure.
- Where did you find it? Outside?
- No, I find it downstairs in the cellar.
I was tapping on the wall all night, following this half of the map.
Let's see the key.
It isn't that kind of a key.
The key is a clue here on the map.
It lead me to the hidden staircase and then to the torture room.
But I need help now.
Come on mates, step lightly.
- I'll come with you.
- Don't let him out of your sight.
This is the old torture chamber.
You mean, this is where they used to take care of them?
Cozy little den.
Me see.
Here is a picture of that chair.
What is it say? The writing is kind of fine.
When at length you find the chair, place a dead man's body there.
Eh?
- I'll be right back.
- Where you are going?
I'm going upstairs to get a body.
- You, get in that chair.
- Who? Me? I ain't dead yet.
- Come on, don't be so self conscious.
- Get in the chair, go on.
Alright but but my heart ain't in it.
You see?
You have to have a real dead body or it don't work.
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm alright.
Look around, there must be a Jewel box down there.
Jewel box?
Jewel box.
- Oh, here's something, maybe this is it.
- Yeah, here.
Give me a hand.
Boy, what a place?
Full of rats and spiders, tarantulas.
- Look, a 16th century piggy bank.
- Yeah, the fortune, she is not in there.
But maybe the key, she is.
See, there's dust here, that's a long time.
That's no key.
That looks more like a check for a short beer.
- What do we do now?
- Well, I don't know.
It is far as I can go with my half of the map.
But if I ever find that fellow who steal who other half, I'm going to break his back.
Here Miss Wendy, you can prove you've been on a treasure hunt, eh?
- Professor, wake up. Wake up.
Oh, where am I?
Excuse me, I must've been walking in my sleep again, I beg your pardon miss.
- You think you better take him back to bed?
- That won't be necessary,
I'm not going to sleep anymore, I'll dress and sit by the fire.
I think it'd be a good idea if we all sit by the fire.
Yes sir, all we need is a half a piece of paper and we've got a fortune.
That wasn't there before.
Nine left, what's that mean?
Wait a minute, weren't there 10 of us here before Rod was killed?
That radio room of yours is quite a layout.
Oh, I see you're making yourself at home.
Well, since you've added murder to your little bag of... tricks, you won't be using the castle much longer.
Cousin George, your patience amazes me.
Four paces to the hidden stairway, then two paces to the wall on the...
Here we go again.
The phantom.
That arrow must've gone right through his heart.
Look, on his shoe.
- I know him, he's Panama Pete.
- Who?
Panama Pete, we were shipmates on the
Selolina the time I find this treasure map.
What's this?
That's the other half of the map.
Now I got it, that's the guy that clonked the skipper.
- The guy we chased off at the water.
- He tried to blow up the boat.
- But why would he do that?
- Keep us away from here.
The other half of the map proves that, he was... probably looking for the treasure when we barged in on him.
Sure, didn't he try to kill me with that arrow contraption the minute I came in here?
Certainly, so that you couldn't use your half.
But why would he try to push the suit of armor over on me?
- To scare us all away.
- How about Rod?
He killed Rod and tried to pin the murder on the skipper with that phony peg leg... so he could have the treasure all to himself.
It looks like our little murder-mystery is solved itself.
But wait, wait a minute, what about the guy that killed the phantom?
He's still around.
Oh no, he took another crack at trying to kill the... skipper and only this time, the mechanism misfired and... and the Archer got caught in his own trap.
Well, then the excitement is all over now.
Aye aye mates, let's go look for the treasure.
From now on, we are under full sail.
No thanks, I'll just stay right here and relax.
How about it Bill? We got a whole map now.
Alright, what can we lose?
Look.
Somebody around here has a pretty grim sense of humor.
- Who do you suppose is doing this?
- Oh, I don't know.
But I think it's about time
I did a little checking up.
According to this half of the map... there should be another room.
Take the coin that you pick up and put in the handle slot.
Handle slot.
- What kind of talk is those?
- You got me.
Handles slots, pump handles, handle with care, pick handles...
Ax heads, here's an ax.
See, here, there is the coin, you put the coin in there in the slot, eh?
- Give me the coin, give me the coin.
- You gave the coin to Wendy.
I give the coin to Wendy, just when we are to put our hands on that treasure...
- I give the coin to...
- Take it easy skipper.
I know where it is, I'll get it.
Well, get the coin, I want to put it in there, get the, get the...
Wendy?
Wendy.
Wendy, Wendy...
Wendy.
- What's the matter, what's the trouble?
- Wendy is gone.
This is more excitement than I've had in years.
Wendy, she's gone and look up there.
Hey, is this somebody's idea of a joke?
It's cousin George, he's been murdered.
Oh professor.
That's Rod's gun.
Poor guy didn't have a chance, wasn't loaded.
Listen, we got to find Wendy and we're going to search this castle till we do.
Mcgoon, take the outside.
Skipper, you take the downstairs and I'll take the upstairs.
If any of us find anything, will report back to Stuff.
Me?
Yes, you stay here and take care of the professor, come on.
Wake up professor, don't be a ninny, wake up. Here, sit down over here.
- Everything is going to be all right.
- Oh, it's terrifying.
Don't do that.
Let's build a fire, a tremendous fire.
Then everything will be more cheerful.
- That's a good idea, I'll get the wood.
- I'll go with you.
Help. Help, help.
Help.
Help.
Help me Bill, help me.
- Alright professor, the masquerade is over.
- Masquerade?
- I don't understand.
- Oh yes, you do.
- The slippers gave you away.
- The slippers?
Real sleepwalkers don't take time to put on slippers.
You're very smart, aren't you?
Not smart enough or I'd caught on hours ago.
The slippers were a mistake, I see I overrated myself.
- Where's Wendy?
- Miss Creighton is quite safe, I believe.
And Stuff?
Stuff might've been injured when he left this room.
- Left?
- Yes.
Chasing phantoms, perhaps.
- Take me to Wendy.
- What's the hurry?
- Come on, I'm not fooling.
- Poor stupid George was in a hurry.
You killed him too?
Yes, when he got in my way, with that same unloaded gun of Rod's.
Well?
Maybe I overrated myself.
As you say, professor, there's no hurry.
Do you mind telling me what this is all about?
Of course not.
I knew about that treasure for years.
- But you said the map was a fake.
- It was quite genuine.
What about all these killings?
Unfortunately, I can't claim the reward for the gangster's death, the phantom did that.
I had to kill the phantom, because he was after my... treasure, you could see for yourself...
- You hurt?
- No.
How you get here?
Well, there's a sliding panel by the fireplace... the professor pulled me through, then took the coin away from me.
- We got to get out of here.
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
Just walk right through one of them walls, what do you think we've been trying to do?
And we can't get out the way you came in either.
Well, there must be some way out, the professor brought you in here.
Can you imagine?
Supposing they start flooding this place with water.
I've heard about that in these old castles.
Hey, out there.
- Can you hear us in here?
- That I can Mate.
The skipper.
Get hold a hold of something, break this wall down.
Maybe you can help me.
Hey, lend me your ax.
Right in here skipper, hey skipper.
Oh, you found the Russian heart, eh?
Now, we got to go take care of Jasper, come on.
Don't worry about him, he's up by the fire.
- Hey, we got to warn Mcgoon and the rest.
- Hey, what you talking about?
- Jasper is the murderer.
- Jasper is the mur, what?
Not that way.
This way.
Now, stay right where you are.
Now captain, throw the map to me.
No.
You better throw it to him, he's crazy.
Sure, he might shoot us all.
You amateurs don't know how to read a map.
Take the coin that you begot and put in the handle slot.
Oh, the slot in the ax handle.
Now I know where the coin goes.
Now you shall see my treasure.
To think that that could've been me.
Oh, here, here quick, the treasure, the treasure.
Somebody help me pull it out, pull, pull.
Hey, give me something.
Give me, give me his gun, yeah.
That's it, we found...
Oh, what a lowdown scurvy trick.
Now what's happened?
- Where did those shots come from?
- I don't know, I...
Say, what's going on here?
That's what I'd like to know, this man took a shot at us as we came ashore.
Well, these guys were prowling around and I... told them to halt and they wouldn't, so I took a pop at them.
Well, we're all a little upset.
We did have rather an exciting night.
- Say, this guy wants to see you.
- Oh, then you are William Martin?
That's right, I'll go peacefully.
Just a moment, young man,
I think you're a bit confused.
I represent a committee that wishes to buy this island for a naval defense base.
What?
And we're prepared to make you a sizable offer for your property.
Now I know why cousin
George wanted to buy this island.
How much?
Oh, I'm sure we can come to a satisfactory arrangement.
I'm sure we can too, I've had about as much of this island as I can take.
Best night's sleep I've had in years.
What's everybody doing up so early?
Well, I'll tell you Thurman, we've had a little treasure hunt and what a success.
Arlene gets rid of
Rod, Mcgoon gets a rewards...
Stuff, the skipper and I get a check for our island... you get a good night's sleep and...
And you had a thrilling trip.
- What have I got to show for it?
- Oh, you have more than anybody else.
You have me.
Now will you give me my chalk?
Try that again and I'll put you on solitary confinement, you would-be Frankenstein.
Don't profane his name with your dirty lips.
He was a genius in whose footsteps
I will follow when I get out of here.
"When you get out."
If I have anything to say about it, you'll never get out.
But I will.
Now, friend Daniel, shall we go on with our work?
Now, this brain is taken from the man and transplanted into the skull of the dog, but given the mind of a human being...
Now, Frankenstein would have severed the spinal cord here, but I'm not certain that he was right.
Could Frankenstein have made me like other men?
He gave life to a body that he made from parts of other bodies that had died.
Yes, Daniel, he could have made you like other men.
Dr. Niemann, did you know Frankenstein?
No. But my brother, who assisted him, learned his secrets.
And before he died, he passed them on to me.
Then you could give me a new body.
If I had Frankenstein's records to guide me,
I could give you a perfect body.
Hyah! Hyah!
Try it again, Herman!
Now, all together!
We could help you.
My arms are strong.
Well, thank you, whoever you are.
Take the front wheel. We'll take this.
Try it again! We have help!
Push!
Hyah! Hyah!
May I offer you the warmth of my living wagon?
Thank you.
So you're a merchant that's been held for ransom by mountain bandits.
For the better part of three months.
And that's your servant?
Do you doubt me?
It's a doubting world, kind sir.
As I, Professor Bruno Lampini, have reason to know.
I have a collection of the world's most astounding horrors.
When I exhibit them, what do I get?
Doubts, jeers, cries of "Fake! Fake!"
You expect your patrons to believe that the skeleton you show them is really that of Count Dracula?
I, Lampini, took it.
Pardon me. Borrowed it from the cellar of Dracula's castle in the Carpathian Mountains.
With my own two hands I spread upon the floor of its coffin a layer of soil taken from its birthplace.
So that by proxy, shall we say, the skeleton of his earthbound spirit might lie at peace within his grave.
Until the withdrawal of the wooden stake from its heart set Dracula free again to satisfy his unholy appetite for blood.
At night, the giant bat would seek its victims.
But before sunrise, return to the safety of his coffin.
Aye, a single ray of sunlight falling upon a vampire would make him helpless.
Do you ever exhibit your show in Visaria?
Visaria...
No. That's a town that doesn't care for horrors.
They had one of their own some 15 years ago when a Dr. Niemann tried to give a dog the mind of a human being.
They threw him in prison because he, like Frankenstein, used bodies of the newly-dead to carry on his work.
Is old Hussman still alive?
He's now the mayor of Reigelberg.
Are you going there, by any chance?
Oh, later on in the season.
It's a small place. Too far away to make a special trip profitable.
Nevertheless, that is where you are going.
I am not going to Reigelberg.
Then Daniel and I will go alone.
No. No!
Now the driver.
Well, you seem worried, friend Daniel.
If they search the ruins of the prison, our bodies will not be found.
We should hide.
And so we shall, but in the open.
All the protection of a traveling show.
I as Lampini, you as my assistant.
Free to move on towards those for whom I have unloving memories.
The ones who sent you to prison?
Strauss, Ullman, and old Hussman, the burgomaster.
Yes, friend Daniel, we will travel to the village of Reigelberg and pay our respects to the Burgomaster.
Your move, Inspector.
That's a neat trap you've got me into.
Checkmate. Put it in the book, Inspector.
- Grandfather?
- Yes.
He's here, Carl.
As a man, I admire you.
As burgomaster, I respect you.
But as a chess player,
Herr Hussman, I hate you.
Did you lose again, Inspector?
It serves you right.
I told you not to play with him.
He always wins, don't you, you old darling?
I hope we're not breaking up your game, but Carl and I have decided...
She means she has decided.
To take in the midnight show of the horror exhibit down at the crossroads.
Spooks, ghouls, vampires.
Get his hat and coat, Carl.
You're going with us.
To stare at a lot of idiotic humbugs?
Not I, my dear. I put my weary bones where they belong, in bed.
Your hat and coat.
I'm not going!
You'd better give in, Grandad.
These American girls can talk you into anything.
That's all they do, talk.
- What? What did you say?
- Aaah!
Now, now, darling.
Remember your blood pressure.
That's the man I married.
Talk, talk, talk, talk!
I can never get a word in edgewise.
Here, put this on.
No.
And no arguments.
- Come along, Inspector.
- No. No.
- You're coming with us, too.
- Oh, but I...
And I don't want any arguments from you either.
Come along. Come on.
Persuasive little minx, isn't she?
Brr! I'm all over goose pimples.
And properly so, you little goose.
Now, don't be grouchy. This is fun.
Master, police inspector.
It's all right, Daniel.
We have our permit.
Oh.
Now, there is something
I could really use.
I wonder where I could get one.
What for?
Just the thing to keep the wife under control.
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Step this way to gaze upon an exhibit absolutely unparalleled in the realms of showmanship.
No doubt there are some among you who will doubt the truth of what I am about to say or doubt the reality of what you are about to see.
But believe me, my friends, this is no fake.
Before your very eyes is all that remains of a vampire.
One of the world's undead.
Dare I but remove this stake from where his heart once beat, and he would rise from the grave within which he lies and turn into a bat, a vampire bat, who'd feed hideously upon the living, whose veins pulsate with warm and vibrant blood.
Ladies and gentlemen, the actual skeleton of Count Dracula, the vampire!
Rubbish. Sheer rubbish.
I don't know, Herr Hussman.
There are many people hereabouts who still believe in the old legend.
Aye, sir. It is true.
I'm surprised at you people.
You seem to doubt what I say,
Herr Burgomaster.
Bats. Vampires.
A stake driven through a skeleton's heart.
Gibberish. Every word of it.
Furthermore, my friends, one single ray of sunlight falling upon a vampire will destroy him.
Say, who are you?
My name is Lampini.
You're not the Lampini I ran out of this area three years ago?
That was my brother, recently deceased.
You remind me of someone.
Someone I can't quite recall.
Perhaps you will remember later,
Herr Burgomaster.
Yes, perhaps.
Drop the stick from your hand.
Drop it.
But if you move,
I'll send your soul back to the limbo of eternal waiting.
Do as I ask, and I will serve you.
I will protect the earth upon which you lie so that before sunrise, your coffin will always be ready for you.
For that,
I will do whatever you wish.
I hope I haven't spoiled your evening for you, Inspector.
As a matter of fact,
I found it most interesting.
But I say good night here.
- Good night, Carl.
- Good night, Inspector.
- Mrs. Hussman.
- Good night.
- See you in the morning, sir.
- Good night, Hans.
Don't get lost in the fog.
Well, you certainly picked a night for it, my pet.
It's like being wrapped in the arms of a gigantic ghost.
Ghosts, vampires!
Can't you talk about anything else?
Listen.
If you're going toward the inn, may I offer you the accommodation of my coach?
You don't have to say that twice.
Pardon me. I'm Carl Hussman and this is Mrs. Hussman.
We are here on our honeymoon.
My congratulations.
And this is my grandfather.
How do you do?
Herr Hussman.
Permit me to introduce myself.
I am Baron Latos from Transylvania.
Well, glad to know you, Baron.
May I suggest that you join me for a bottle of wine at the inn?
In the nature of, shall we say, a celebration, Mrs. Hussman?
Well, that's a wonderful idea if Grandad doesn't mind.
Yes. A glass of wine will warm my blood.
But you will accept our hospitality, Baron.
The wine of the country from my cellar.
Thank you, Herr Hussman.
Driver, stop at the Hussman home.
Oh, driver, go around to the kitchen.
Ask the cook to make you some coffee.
Thank you, Herr Burgomeister.
I drink to love.
A union to last throughout eternity.
A love free from all material needs.
I'll drink to that lack of material needs myself, Baron, but not till I raid the wine cellar, I won't.
Excuse me, darling. Be right back, Baron.
You admire my ring?
When I look at it,
I see glimpses of a strange world.
A world of people who are dead and yet alive.
It is the place from which I've just returned.
It frightens me.
Wear it.
It will drive away your fears.
It's too large.
It will become smaller.
No.
I'm afraid.
Take it back.
It is the bond that links us together.
I see your world more clearly now.
I'm no longer afraid.
I will come for you before the dawn.
Now, as I was saying...
I haven't the remotest idea what I was saying.
I've been asleep.
I must apologize, Baron.
It must have been the wine.
It's quite all right, Herr Hussman.
Oh, here we are.
It's very late. I hadn't realized we talked so long. I must be leaving.
Well, it's been a swell party, Baron.
We'll save this for next time.
Good night, Baron.
Thank you for your hospitality,
Herr Hussman.
- Not at all. Good night.
- Good night.
Why, Rita, aren't you going to bid me good night?
Good night, Grandfather.
Good night, my dear.
Lampini. Lampini.
- Good night, Baron.
- Good night, sir.
Lampini.
Niemann.
Of course.
Dr. Niemann.
Well, it turned out to be fun after all, didn't it, darling?
It's a wonderful night.
The darkness beckons to me.
Another world.
The world I see is far away, yet very near.
A strange and beautiful world in which one may be dead and yet alive.
Rita, what is it?
What's happened to you?
I'm going away.
Dracula crest.
Like the one on the coffin.
Where did you get it?
From Baron Latos.
Baron Latos?
We've got to get it off.
I want to go there, Carl.
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Connect me with Inspector Arnz. Hurry!
- Hello?
- Hello, Inspector. This is Carl Hussman.
- My grandfather has been killed.
- Herr Hussman?
Wounds on the neck? Want kind of wounds?
Two small punctures like teeth marks.
I'll be right over.
Rita!
Rita! Rita!
Arnz!
Arnz!
Arnz!
My wife, in that carriage.
Master! The police. They're after us.
Look, Master.
I think they're after Dracula.
There's one way to stop them.
Yes.
Aah!
Fejos, the police!
Ah, Herr Inspector, you missed Ilonka's dance.
She's pretty, too.
I will have her dance again especially for you.
Not in the village of
Frankenstein, you won't.
We've had nothing but stealing since you came here.
The Burgomeister says you're to move on.
But, Herr Inspector...
No arguments. Break camp and get out.
All right, the show's over.
Go back to your homes.
Oh, Daniel.
Now drive on.
We'll camp beyond those trees.
What've you got here?
A chamber of horrors.
The Burgomaster won't grant you a permit, so pack up and be on your way.
But why?
There's nothing in my exhibit to offend anyone.
We've had enough horrors around here.
Do you see those ruins?
Our village has been quiet and peaceful since the dam broke and swept the Wolf Man and the Frankenstein monster to their destruction several years ago.
No one ever mentions that place, nor does anyone ever go near it.
That's why you can't exhibit here.
We want nothing to remind us of something that we've been trying to forget.
But we've come a long way and the horses are tired.
It's very late.
Could we at least rest here until tomorrow?
No, you've got to move on.
All right, Daniel, we'll move on.
Hand over the money the villagers gave you.
Only your share.
All of it.
When I joined you, it was agreed that I keep half.
Give me the money.
If you try to rob me,
I'll tell the police that it's you who's been doing the stealing around here!
I'll thrash you within an inch of your life.
Let me go, you smelly pig!
No, Fejos! No! No! No!
No, I say! Fejos!
Daniel! Daniel!
Do you want to bring the police on us?
Go and get him out of here before he kills him.
Master, she's hurt.
May I take her with us?
No, we only have tonight to search for the Frankenstein records.
Please, Master, she's hurt.
All right, if it will keep you in your right senses.
Are you awake?
You've nothing to be afraid of.
Now I remember.
Who are you?
I'm Daniel.
I'm with Professor Lampini's show.
Here, I brought you some tea.
It will make you feel better.
That was nice of you.
Are you the one that helped me?
It made me mad when he whipped you.
But he can't hurt you anymore.
They've gone.
Leaving me a hundred miles from nowhere.
No, but we're going to Visaria.
You can travel with us.
You can sleep here and talk to me when I drive.
I get so lonesome when I have no one to talk to.
You don't know me very well.
I might talk you to death.
Your name's Ilonka, isn't it?
You know all about me, don't you, Daniel?
I watched you dance.
Did you?
Did you like me?
You're pretty.
You're afraid of me, aren't you?
Afraid of you?
If you weren't, you'd come up here where I could see you better.
But you will talk to me sometimes?
Won't you?
Of course I will.
You've been kind to me and I like you.
Daniel. Daniel!
Yes, Master.
You come with me.
I've found a way into the ruins.
Master, if we find the Frankenstein records, will you make me like other men?
To please your little gypsy girl, friend Daniel, I'll make you an Adonis.
Here's a book, Master!
Does it...
Help me, Master!
Daniel, are you hurt?
No, Master.
Evidently the force of the flood burst through that wall and washed everything into the cave beyond.
We'd better look for the records in there.
A glacial ice cavern.
The Wolf Man.
Master, over there!
The undying monster.
The triumphant climax of Frankenstein's genius and the Wolf Man.
They may know where the records are, friend Daniel.
We'll set them free and they will help us.
Master! Master!
Who are you?
Why have you freed me from the ice that imprisoned the beast that lived within me?
Why?
Perhaps to help you, Mr. Talbot.
No earthly power can help those that are marked by the sign of the pentagram.
You came here to ask Frankenstein for help, didn't you?
Yes, but I was too late.
He was dead.
I wanted to die, too.
Nevertheless, when Dr. Mannering trailed you here from England, you asked him for help.
I did, but he became more interested in the monster than he was in me.
When the villagers learned that he had brought the monster back to life, they blew up the darn.
These frozen waters have held you here all these years.
And now you've brought me back to a life of misery.
With each full moon,
I turn into a werewolf.
I kill.
I want to die.
Only death can bring me release.
You don't have to die, my boy. You're wrong.
I can help you.
How? How can you help me?
I, too, am a doctor.
A scientist like Frankenstein.
Do you know where he kept his records?
I think so.
Show me those records and I'll build a new brain for you.
I'll lift this curse from you forever.
He wanted life and strength.
I wanted only death.
Here we are.
The answer to both your problems lies here.
But in my laboratory in Visaria,
I have the equipment to restore his strength.
Then I must wait until we reach Visaria.
You must be patient.
The horses are harnessed, Master.
Can you drive?
Why, yes.
Then take the road to Visaria.
Master, is he going to drive all the time?
Yes, I need you here.
We must apply hot compresses.
The ice has seriously damaged his tissues.
What's the matter, Daniel, you got bugs?
You're not Daniel.
No, Daniel's back with the doctor.
Who are you?
Just the driver.
Are you going to Visaria with us?
Yes.
I promised Daniel I'd keep him company while he drove.
But I'll talk to you if you want me to.
My name's Ilonka. What's yours?
Lawrence.
Lawrence?
Do they call you Larry?
They used to.
Larry! Larry!
I have something for you.
Look.
Pretty.
What's the matter with you?
We've been together three days, and you haven't smiled once.
I think I'd like you better if you smiled.
Now don't start barking at me.
There's a nice big smile for you.
Now give me one.
You see how easy it is?
Then why are you always so sad?
I wish you'd tell me.
Why?
Because I like you.
Tell me. Maybe I can help.
No one could help me.
Daniel?
Hurry up with that water.
You going to stand there all day?
Get started.
We've lost too much time already.
Master, why can't I drive part of the time?
But Talbot bothers me with his everlasting impatience.
We must get the monster to Visaria before further changes make restoration more difficult.
The desiccation of the tissues has gone further than I thought
It's not as bad as I feared.
Our equipment is still usable.
We must go to work and get it in shape as quickly as possible.
Turn on the steam.
Steam will soften the tissues so that the high-frequency current will go through them.
How long will it take?
A day. Perhaps longer.
Why must you do that now?
You have everything you need here.
Operate on me.
I've yet to find a way of combining
Frankenstein's technique with my own.
The moon will be full tonight.
You know what that means.
I can't stand to go through that torture again. I tell you, I can't!
An operation now would be a failure.
It would leave you exactly as you are.
You must wait.
Wait!
All right, Daniel.
Master, Talbot is big and strong.
Will you give me...
Forget Talbot. We have work to do.
But, Master, you promised...
All in due time, Daniel.
Tonight we call on my old friends,
Ullman and Strauss.
Herr Strauss.
Yes. What do you want?
Remember me? I'm Dr. Niemann.
Dr. Niemann?
Yes, Frederick.
Come with me.
Pardon me, Herr Ullman.
Do you know Herr Strauss?
The garrulous gentleman who testified that he saw me take a body from its grave.
We don't forget, Herr Strauss, do we?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is that more comfortable?
Niemann, I've saved 15,000 marks...
Since you testified for the state to save your miserable hide?
Let me go, Niemann.
Let me go and the money is yours.
Every bit of it.
15,000 marks.
A thousand for every year that I spent in the stinking, slimy dungeon.
You bargain poorly, Herr Ullman.
Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't...
Kill my trusted old assistant?
Why, no.
I'm going to repay you for betraying me.
I'm going to give that brain of yours a new home in the skull of the Frankenstein monster.
As for you, Strauss,
I'm going to give you the brain of the Wolf Man so that all your waking hours will be spent in untold agony, awaiting the full of the moon, which will change you into a werewolf.
The plasma must flow at exactly that rate.
No more, no less.
If there's any change, call me.
- Master.
- Yes?
Now that I've helped you with Strauss and Ullman, will you give Talbot's body to me?
What?
He's big. He's strong.
Talbot's body is the perfect home for the monster's brain, which I will add to and subtract from in my experiments.
Master, you made me a promise.
No!
You think I'd wreck the work of a lifetime because you're in love with a gypsy girl?
I've killed four men for you.
Do as I say or I'll never help you.
Larry!
Larry!
Daniel, you frightened me.
Have you seen Larry?
What's the matter? Don't you like Larry?
You used to smile at me sometimes, before he joined us.
Why, Daniel, I believe you're jealous.
You love him, don't you?
He's in some kind of trouble, I think.
I want to help him.
You do love him.
But he doesn't know it.
It wouldn't make any difference to him if he did.
Why not? Why wouldn't it make any difference to him?
Do you see that?
It's a star.
A five-pointed star.
- The pentagram.
- The pentagram!
The sign of the beast.
"Even a man who's pure in heart
"and says his prayers by night..."
"Will become a werewolf when the wolf bane blooms
"and the moon is full and bright."
He's a werewolf.
Oh, no!
No, not him. Not Larry!
You're lying! You're lying to me!
No.
No, I'm trying to protect you.
Stay away from him.
When the moon is full again, he'll turn.
And he'll kill.
He'll kill.
I don't believe you.
You're making it all up because you're jealous.
I hate you.
You're mean and you're ugly!
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!
She hates me because
I'm an ugly hunchback.
If it wasn't for you,
I'd have Talbot's body.
Yes, Mrs. Strauss.
Yes, yes, yes, Mrs. Strauss.
What about our beers, Hoffman?
At once, Herr Burgomeister.
I must go now, Mrs. Strauss. Good day.
I don't know. I don't know.
The housewives, they ask me where their husbands are all the time.
What are you muttering about, Hoffman?
Strauss hasn't been home since yesterday.
His wife's very worried about him.
Sleeping off a drunk probably.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
Ullman hasn't been home since last night either.
Neither has Braun, the storekeeper.
That's odd.
When one man doesn't come home, you think nothing of it.
When three men disappear overnight, particularly in a small town like Visaria, you begin to wonder.
Inspector! I found Herr Braun.
Out in the woods.
- He's dead.
- Dead?
What do you make of it, Doctor?
The jugular vein is severed.
Not cut, but torn apart as though by powerful teeth.
A werewolf!
We'll all be murdered.
Heaven help us.
I must warn my wife and children.
Schwartz, Meier, come back here.
I forbid that you spread such talk.
What do you want to do?
Drive folks from Visaria and ruin our village forever?
I'm ashamed of you, all of you, believing in such idiotic superstitions.
Then how do you explain that?
And how about Strauss?
And Ullman. What happened to them?
If there's a werewolf, our people should know about it.
I think so too, Herr Burgomeister.
Our children aren't safe.
If there's a werewolf, let's find him.
Aye, search for the werewolf!
All right! All right!
Organize your searching parties.
The inspector will head one group,
Schwartz another, and Meier a third.
Find your werewolf.
"Even a man who is pure at heart and says his prayers by night..."
Then you know?
Daniel told me.
Oh, Larry.
Last night, I killed a man.
You didn't know what you were doing.
But I did.
I wanted to kill and I knew that I wanted to.
Tonight the moon will rise again and I'll become that beast.
I'll kill again.
Can't Dr. Niemann do anything for you?
Ask him, Larry. Ask him.
Oh, he says that he can, but he keeps putting me off.
I don't trust him.
I can't go on waiting and killing and waiting.
I...
I want forgetfulness, peace.
I want to help you.
I'll do anything.
When that spell comes over me,
I'd kill anyone.
I won't let you.
I won't let you out of my sight.
I might even kill you.
I couldn't help myself.
I'm not afraid.
It's no use, Ilonka.
Only death can bring us peace of mind.
And a werewolf doesn't just die.
He must be killed.
Killed by a silver bullet.
Fired by the hand of one who loves him enough to understand.
He must be killed.
Killed by a silver bullet.
Fired by the hand of someone who loves him enough to understand.
Turbines.
Now the generator.
Check the megavoltage.
Twenty-five thousand.
Increase to 50.
The electronic bombardment will penetrate...
Listen to me, Niemann.
You promised that if I found the Frankenstein records, you'd cure me of this curse.
I found them, gave them to you.
Now it's time for you to keep your part of the bargain.
My boy, you must have patience.
I've waited long enough.
Last night I suffered the tortures of the damned.
I killed a man.
Tonight the moon will be full again.
Now you stop whatever you're doing and operate on me or I swear, I'll...
Would you destroy your only hope of release?
Well, any sign of your werewolf yet?
We're early for him, I guess.
Oh, so he appears on schedule like a train, is that it?
Increase your megavoltage to 100,000.
Danger, Master! Danger, Master!
Danger!
Decrease!
Hello, Schwartz! Ja, come here quick!
What's the matter? What is it?
Lights at Dr. Niemann's.
Weird lights. Flashing all over the old place.
- At Dr. Niemann's?
- Yeah, we saw them from the road.
His place has been closed for 15 years.
We better investigate.
Larry?
Go away.
No, Larry, let me in!
Go away, I tell you.
Tell Talbot I'm ready for him.
Master.
Master.
The Wolf Man.
The only thing I ever loved.
It wouldn't have happened if you kept faith with me.
I served you well, Master.
Remember Lampini? Strauss?
Ullman?
Now you're going to join them.
Aaah!
Search the castle and grounds.
The Frankenstein monster!
The Frankenstein monster!
Can't stand fire.
Aah!
Set fire to the marsh grass.
Drive him back into the bog.
Don't go this way. Quicksands! Quicksands!
Not this way. Quicksands!
Not that way. Quicksands! Quicksands!
I walked with a zombie.
It does seem an odd thing to say.
Had anyone said that to me a year ago...
I'm not at all sure
I would have known what a zombie was.
I might have had some notion...
that they were strange and frightening...
even a little funny.
It all began in such an ordinary way.
- You're single?
- Yes.
- Where were you trained?
- Memorial Hospital here in Ottawa.
Now this last question is a little irregular, Miss Connell.
I really don't know quite how to begin.
Do you believe in witchcraft?
Well...
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital... but I had my suspicions about the Directress of Training.
Now, as to salary, it's quite good.
- $200 a month.
- That is good.
But I'd like to know a little bit more about the case.
I'm afraid I can't tell you much... only that the patient is the wife of Mr. Paul Holland... with whom we do considerable business.
- That will mean another interview?
- No, this is quite final.
You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.
He lives on Saint Sebastian in the West Indies.
The West Indies?
That's not so bad, sit under a palm tree... go swimming, take sunbaths.
Palm trees.
It seemed only a few days before I met Mr. Holland in Antigua.
We boarded the boat for Saint Sebastian.
It was all just as I had imagined it.
I looked at those great glowing stars.
I felt the warm wind on my cheek.
I breathed deep and every bit of me inside myself said:
"How beautiful."
It's not beautiful!
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer.
Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.
Those flying fish... they are not leaping for joy.
They're jumping in terror.
Bigger fish want to eat them.
That luminous water... it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies.
The glitter of putrescence.
There's no beauty here, only death and decay.
You can't really believe that.
Everything good dies here, even the stars.
It was strange to have him break in on my thoughts that way.
There was cruelty and hardness in his voice.
And yet something about him I liked.
Something clean and honest...
but hurt, badly hurt.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort.
And now, no longer.
The Hollands was the most old family, miss.
They brought the colored folks to the island... the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Ti-Misery? What's that?
A man, miss. An old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland.
With arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
Alive?
No, miss, he's just the same as he was in the beginning... on the front side of an enormous boat.
- You mean a figurehead.
- If you say, miss.
And the enormous boat brought the long-ago fathers... and the long-ago mothers of us all, chained to the bottom of the boat.
They brought you to a beautiful place, didn't they?
If you say, miss. If you say.
Fort Holland.
From the gate, it seemed strangely dreamlike.
The garden had life of its own.
I was to know all the nooks and crannies of that great house...
to love them or hate them, according to what happened there.
In that house,
I was to hear a strange confession...
a confession only madness could have wrung from the lips of a sane person.
And yet it was in the same room...
with the candles lit, that I made the discovery of my own love...
knew happiness, deep through the heart.
My room...
I still can remember my delight, unpacking, getting ready for dinner.
Yet, all the while, I wondered at the stillness of Fort Holland.
The fact that I saw no one on the garden paths or in the rooms.
Yes?
- Miss Connell, it's dinner.
- Thank you.
- Miss Connell?
- Yes.
I'm Wesley Rand.
Paul wanted me to introduce myself.
It seems we're dining by ourselves,
Miss Connell.
But I think I'll introduce you to everyone anyway.
Here in the master's chair, sits the master, my half-brother, Paul Holland.
But you've met him already.
Yes, on the boat.
That chair in the corner is the particular property of Mrs. Rand... mother to both of us and much too good for either of us... too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof.
- She prefers the village dispensary.
- She's a doctor?
No, she just runs the place.
She does everything else, though.
An amazing woman. You'd like her.
I like her already.
That's my chair, and this is Miss Connell, who is beautiful.
Thank you.
Who sits there?
My brother's wife.
Here, this isn't cozy at all.
Makes me seem aloof, and I'm anything but that.
But you are an American.
I went to school in Buffalo.
Paul went to school in England.
I wondered about your different accents.
I'm still wondering about your names,
Rand and Holland.
We're half-brothers.
Paul is Mother's first child.
When his father died, she married my father, Dr. Rand, the missionary.
The jungle drums, mysterious, eerie.
That's the work drum over at the sugar mill.
Saint Sebastian's version of the factory whistle.
It means that the sugar syrup is about ready to be poured.
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
Of course.
It was nice of you to spend this much time with me.
Don't worry, I wasn't missed. The only important man around here is the owner.
- Mr. Holland?
- Yes, the redoubtable Paul.
He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have the charm.
I don't know. He spoke to me on the boat last night, and I liked him very much.
Yes, our Paul... strong and silent and very sad... quite the Byronic character.
Maybe I should cultivate it.
- Maybe you ought to go to the mill.
- It'll wait.
I was just going to the mill.
- Good night, Miss Connell.
- Good night.
- Have the servants made you comfortable?
- Yes, thank you.
Looks very nice, Clement.
I'll take it to Mrs. Holland.
- Can't I take it for you?
- No, thank you.
Tomorrow's soon enough for you to start work.
Mrs. Holland.
Mrs. Holland?
Mrs. Holland.
Mrs. Holland?
I didn't mean to get you up, Mrs. Holland.
Mrs. Holland.
Jessica!
Take Mrs. Holland to her room, Alma.
Come, Miss Jessica. Come with Alma.
I heard someone crying, a woman.
A woman crying?
There's been no crying here.
Mr. Paul, yes, there was crying tonight.
It was Alma, her sister was brought a-birthing.
Thank you, Clement.
Clement, I'm going to stay with Miss Jessica... in case the nurse lady takes to roaming again.
Don't you go crying anymore.
That's what frightened Miss Betsy.
She didn't soothe me any, hollering around in the tower.
Why was the maid crying?
I'm not sure I can make you understand.
Do you know what this is?
- A figure of Saint Sebastian.
- Yes.
But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.
That's where our people came from... from the misery and pain of slavery.
For generations, they found life a burden.
That's why they still weep when a child is born and make merry at a burial.
I've told you, Miss Connell, this is a sad place.
Good morning, miss.
Thank you for waking me.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, miss.
That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
Don't get up, miss.
I brought your breakfast... just like I do for Miss Jessica.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma.
You don't have to do that for me.
I know it, miss, but I like to do it.
I like to tend for Miss Jessica, and I want to tend for you.
You settle right back now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Thank you.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way... for a lady to break her fast... in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head on.
If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell.
She looked so pretty.
She must have been beautiful.
What happened to her, Alma?
She was very sick, and then she went mindless, miss.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
I do my best.
Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.
It's just like dressing a great big doll.
What's this?
A puffup, I call it.
But Miss Jessica always says brioche.
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast.
I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
I made it clear in my letter to the company... this is not a position for a frightened girl.
I am not a frightened girl.
That's hard to believe after what happened last night.
If I were as timid as you seem to think,
Mr. Holland...
I wouldn't have gone to the tower in the first place.
And what's so alarming about the tower,
Miss Connell?
Nothing really.
But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place, so dark.
Surely, nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Of course not.
I used to be afraid of the dark when I was a child.
But I'm not afraid anymore.
Frankly, it was something of a shock to see my patient that way for the first time.
Nobody had told me
Mrs. Holland was a mental case.
A mental case?
- I'm sorry.
- Why should you be?
My wife is a mental case.
Please remember that, Miss Connell... particularly when some of the foolish people on the island... start regaling you with local legends.
You'll find superstition a contagious thing.
Some people let it get the better of them.
- I don't think you will.
- No.
Come along. I'll introduce you to Dr. Maxwell and your patient.
I can't tell you how glad I am to have you here, Miss Connell.
I know I'll enjoy working with you, Doctor.
I have an enormous respect for nurses, but most of them scare me.
I always feel them behind my back, looking at their training manuals... counting my mistakes.
I'll keep tabs on you.
She makes a beautiful zombie, doesn't she?
- It's pitiful.
- I knew Jessica. We were friends.
Sometimes it's better for a doctor to laugh... than pull a long face when things are hopeless.
Yes, I know.
But I don't know about zombies, Doctor.
Just what is a zombie?
A ghost, a living dead. It's also a drink.
Yes, I tried one once, but there wasn't anything dead about it.
But we have a more serious problem to deal with, Miss Connell.
You want to know about your patient, don't you?
Please.
I'll try to put it simply.
Mrs. Holland had a tropical fever... very severe.
We might say that portions of the spinal cord were burned out by this fever.
The result is what you see... a woman without any willpower... unable to speak or even act by herself.
Though she will obey simple commands.
- Does she suffer?
- I don't know.
I'd rather think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened... feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
There's very little we can do except keep her physically comfortable... light diet, some exercise.
She can never be cured?
I've never heard of a cure.
Could you give me some details of treatment and diet?
- I prepared these for you last night.
- Thank you.
I'll drop by in a day or so to see how you are getting on.
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
Mrs. Holland must have been very beautiful.
Many people thought her beautiful.
Tell me, Miss Connell, do you consider yourself pretty?
I don't know. I suppose so.
And charming?
- I've never given it much thought.
- Don't.
You'll save yourself a great deal of trouble... and other people a great deal of unhappiness.
- Betsy, where are you going?
- It's my day off.
What in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
I was just beginning to wonder.
Aren't there shops and restaurants and things here?
"And things" is a better description of what you'll find.
I'd better come along and show you the town.
Don't you have to work?
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Some talk of Alexander
And some of Hercules
Of Hector and Lysander
And such great names as these
But of all the world's great heroes
There's none that
Ti-Joseph, better bring me another.
I have to keep the lady entertained.
Must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
- Six ounces?
- Higher mathematics.
Two ounces to a drink.
Three drinks, six ounces.
How did you know there were two ounces in a drink?
I'm a nurse. I always watch people when they pour something.
I watched Ti-Joseph, and it was exactly two ounces.
There was a family
That lived on the isle of Saint Sebastian
A long, long while
The head of the family was a Holland man
And the younger brother his name was Rand
Ah, woe
Listen, did I ever tell you the story about the little mule on the plantation?
Wait a minute, I want to listen.
The Holland man, he kept in a tower
A wife as pretty as a big, white flower
She saw the brother and she stole his heart
And that's how the badness and the trouble start.
Ti-Malice, you tripped up my tongue.
Why do you wish trouble me for?
You saw Mr. Rand go in there.
Why don't you tell me?
Apologize, that's what I'll do.
Creep in just like a little fox, and warm myself in his heart.
I wouldn't have listened, Wesley, if I'd realized I...
- Mr. Rand, I've come to apologize.
- All right.
It's just an old song
I picked up somewhere.
- Don't know who did make it up.
- All right, all right.
Some of these singers on this island, they'd tattletale on anybody.
Believe me, I never would sing that song if I'd known you were with a lady.
Get out of here!
Don't let it bother you so, Wesley.
You heard what he sang.
Shocked?
- I just wish I hadn't heard.
- Why?
Everybody else knows it, Paul saw to that.
Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning... just to watch me squirm.
That doesn't sound like him.
That's right, he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he?
That won't last long.
I think we'd better go now.
Will you take me home?
One of these days he will start on you just like he did on her.
"You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"
"You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"
What he could do to that word "beautiful."
That's Paul's great weapon, words.
He uses them like other men use their fist.
Wes, it's time we started home.
The wife and the brother, they want to go
But the Holland man, he tell them no
The wife fall down and the evil came
And it burned her mind in the fever flame
Wes, we must get back to Fort Holland.
Shame and sorrow for the family
Her eyes are empty and she cannot talk
And a nurse has come to make her walk
The brothers are lonely and the nurse is young
And now you must see that my song is sung
Ah, woe, ah, me
Shame and sorrow for the family
Ah, woe, ah, me
Shame and sorrow for the family
- I think you need some help.
- I'm afraid so.
Ti-Joseph... get Mr. Rand onto his horse and start him toward the Fort.
But he's in no condition to ride.
I don't think he could even sit in the saddle.
Don't worry about a sugar planter.
Give him a horse, and he'll ride to his own funeral.
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this.
I'm Mrs. Rand, Wesley's mother.
Mrs. Rand...
Now don't tell me you're sorry that I should meet you this way.
I'm even a little glad that
Wesley's difficulties brought us together.
Believe me, he doesn't do this often. It's...
Nonsense. I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.
I know a great deal more about what goes on at the Fort than you'd think.
I know all about you... that you're a nice girl, competent... and kind to Jessica.
The Fort needs a girl like you.
Come, I must get you back there.
I'll walk back with you and stay the night.
- The change will do me good.
- Thanks, Mrs. Rand.
I think you're every bit as nice as Wesley says you are.
So, he says I'm nice.
He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell... a very nice boy.
I'm worried about his drinking, though.
You could do me a great favor.
I'd love to.
Use your influence with Paul.
Ask him to take the whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
- I have no influence with Mr. Holland.
- Try it.
You may have more than you think.
No, it's not a drought, Bayard.
Rain's just a little late, that's all.
I've seen the drought before, Mr. Holland.
The cane is too dry, and it's dangerous that way.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday. On your first day off, too.
- I had a good time up to a point.
- Wes can be very entertaining.
Yes, he can. But I was wondering... you know, if you could leave the whiskey decanter off the table...
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.
I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's.
But it must be an added temptation to Wesley and... though your brother is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland...
I can tell you, as a nurse, that it won't be long.
Miss Connell, I engaged you to take care of my wife, not my brother.
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.
There they go.
Bayard told me they were going to ask Damballah for rain.
The fields are as dry as dust.
But what is it, Mr. Holland?
It's a big seashell, a conch.
They make a sort of bugle out of it to call the faithful to the houmfort.
But I don't know what a houmfort is or a Damballah.
It's voodoo. The houmfort is the temple... and Damballah is one of the gods, the big papa god.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.
I thought voodoo was something everyone was frightened of.
I am afraid it's not very frightening.
They sing and dance and carry on.
And then, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down... and speaks through one of the people.
For some reason, they always pick a night like this.
This hot wind even sets me on edge.
Clement, you've forgotten the decanter.
I think from now on, Wes, we'll try serving dinner without it.
That's odd.
What are you trying to do, impress Miss Connell?
You would make a better impression without whiskey.
Thank you.
You've always had such tender concern for me and for Jessica.
- Let's drop it, Wes.
- Why?
It isn't considered polite to quarrel before ladies.
I see, let's be reserved and gentlemanly.
You were so reserved and gentlemanly, so polite, that night with Jessica.
- I remember...
- Wes!
Miss Connell...
I think it will be better if I had Clement bring the rest of your dinner to your room.
I heard you playing.
I often do.
I know what you went through tonight.
I kept thinking of what you said... that all good things died here violently.
Why did you come in here?
I don't know.
I wanted to help you.
And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
You have helped me.
I want you to know that I'm sorry I ever brought you here.
When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
I love Fort Holland.
And what you saw tonight... two brothers set against each other... and a woman driven mad by her own husband... do you love that?
You didn't drive her mad.
Before Jessica was taken ill, there was a scene... an ugly scene.
I told her she couldn't go... that I'd keep her here by force, if necessary.
You never knew Jessica as she was.
I think it would be best for all of us not to discuss this again.
Thank you. I know you meant to be kind.
I don't know how their own love is revealed to other women.
Maybe in their sweetheart's arms,
I don't know.
To me it came that night...
after Paul Holland had almost thrust me from the room...
certainly from his life.
I said I love him.
Even as I said it,
I knew he still loved his wife.
And then, because I loved him,
I felt I had to restore her to him...
to make her what she'd been before...
to make him happy.
All that you say comes to the same thing.
You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my wife.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Paul... as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it to me, but...
You admit that this is terribly dangerous.
So why do you advise it?
I've worked with it. I've seen cures.
It's at least a hope.
It's the very danger itself, Paul, that makes the cure possible.
Insulin produces a state of coma.
Then the patient is revived by a violent shock to the nerves.
That shock can kill, but it can also cure.
I don't know.
It's a hard decision to make, but yours is only a technical responsibility.
Technical responsibility.
Real responsibility.
The question is, will she live or die?
You're wrong, Mr. Holland.
It isn't a question of life or death.
Your wife isn't living.
She's in a world that's empty of joy or meaning.
We have a chance to give her life back to her.
- Well?
- She's alive, that's all.
Don't take it so much to heart, Betsy.
I imagined it so differently.
I've been waiting for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again.
And I come bringing you nothing.
Instead, you come bringing me sympathy,
Betsy... and a generous heart. Don't forget that.
Don't call that nothing.
Very sad. Very sweet.
The noble husband and the noble nurse comforting each other... because the patient still lives.
I've been imagining, too, Paul... only I didn't have to wonder how I'd feel.
I knew.
I'm not in love with another woman.
I'm sorry, Miss Betsy.
I'll take it right away.
That's all right, Alma.
Is this your sister's baby?
Yes, Miss Betsy. This is little Ti-Victor and my sister, Melisse.
I'm so glad I came out.
I've been wanting to meet you, Melisse.
More so, miss.
He's a wonderful baby.
He's beautiful, yes.
He's chosen you, miss.
That's what we say, Miss Betsy, when a baby first goes visiting.
Those he smiles at will be his friends.
That makes me very proud.
Here, Ti-Victor.
That's so you won't forget
I'm your friend.
Thanks, Miss Betsy.
It's nice to see people so happy.
They're not always happy, Miss Betsy.
I suppose not.
Things so bad nobody can help, not even Dr. Maxwell.
Doctors and nurses can do only so much, Alma.
They can't cure everything.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
What do you mean
"doctors that are people"?
There are other doctors.
Yes, other doctors.
Better doctors.
- Where?
- At the houmfort.
That's nonsense, Alma.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.
Mama Rose was mindless.
I was at the houmfort when the houngan brought her mind back.
- Was Mama Rose like Mrs. Holland?
- No.
She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.
But the houngan cured her.
Are you trying to tell me that the voodoo priest could cure Mrs. Holland?
Yes, Miss Betsy, I mean that.
The houngan will speak to the rada drums... and the drums will speak to Legba and Damballah.
Better doctors.
Ti-Peter, how do you ever expect to get to heaven with one foot... in the voodoo houmfort and the other in the church?
Get along with you.
Some of this native nonsense.
The houngan has his prescription, and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
You never talked about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
Haven't I?
I suppose I take it for granted.
- It's just part of everyday life here.
- You don't believe in it?
A missionary's widow?
Isn't very likely, is it?
I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion.
I mean, do you believe it has power?
Do you think it could cure a sick person?
Frankly, my dear,
I didn't expect anything like that... from a nice levelheaded girl like you.
What are you driving at?
I heard the servants talking about Mama Rose.
They said she'd been mindless.
Her son drowned. It affected her mind.
The houngan cured her by giving her a little practical psychology.
What if I took Jessica to see him?
You don't know what goes on at the houmfort.
It might be very dangerous to take her there... dangerous for both of you.
These people are primitive.
Things that are natural to them might shock and horrify you.
- I'm not easily frightened.
- That may be the pity of it.
I'm going to the houmfort, Alma.
You go right from the mill to an obeah sign in the cane.
Here you turn and face a banyan tree on the hill.
Walk toward it and keep walking.
Keep walking, Miss Betsy... and you'll come to the crossroads.
There's a guard there, Carrefour.
He keeps the crossroads.
But he won't do you no harm when he sees the voodoo patches.
He'll let you pass.
Where are my people?
Let them bring me the rice cakes.
Let them dance and be happy.
Damballah, this woman is ill.
Mrs. Rand.
I knew you'd come.
I couldn't let you go back without some word.
I came here to tell you again
Jessica cannot be cured.
But what are you doing here?
...and when my husband died,
I was helpless.
They disobeyed me.
And, accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them.
There was a woman with a baby.
Again and again, I begged her to boil the drinking water. She wouldn't.
Then I told her the god Shango... would kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it.
From then on, she boiled the water.
But that still doesn't explain why you're here.
Perhaps not, but I am here.
It seems so simple to let the gods speak through me.
I should have known there's no easy way to do good, Betsy.
- She doesn't bleed.
- Zombie.
She doesn't bleed.
Get her back to the Fort, Betsy.
Do as I say. They won't hurt you.
Leave them alone. Let them go.
Where have you been, Miss Connell?
- I wanted to help you.
- Help me? How?
I took Mrs. Holland to the houmfort.
I thought they might cure her.
There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?
Why should that mean so much to you?
You know why.
You saw it the other night at the piano.
What I saw the other night
I could hardly believe, Betsy.
I thought I was looking at a woman who had compassion for me... who loved me.
And yet you made that trip to the houmfort... to bring Jessica back to me.
You, the nurse who's afraid of the dark.
Yes.
You think I love Jessica and want her back.
It's like you to think that, clean, decent thinking.
I wish it were true... perhaps for your sake.
Mind me now, horse.
Come away from there.
Are you ever stubborn.
Just like that old Sabreur man at the houmfort... sticking your nose in places where it isn't wanted... making trouble for everybody.
Alma.
You try it this way.
Turn your back on him.
You see, that's the way it is with a horse.
You can't look at him and lead him at the same time.
Sounds sort of manlike, doesn't it?
- Whose horse?
- The police horse.
Police? I didn't know there was a policeman on the island.
Just this horse, Miss Betsy.
When they asked the Commissioner if any policemen were wanted... he said my horse is all the police we need on Saint Sebastian.
Commissioner?
Yes, Miss Betsy.
I expect there's some trouble... not just little trouble, like Mr. Rand gets into... when he's been drinking more than a little, but real big trouble.
You don't suppose it's because I took
Mrs. Holland to the houmfort, do you?
They haven't been talking loud enough for me to hear, Miss Betsy.
But I've been holding this horse for coming on close to an hour.
And they've been just talking and talking.
I feel it's something very bad.
You do have a horse to hold, Alma... and Mrs. Rand has asked me to have a cup of tea with her.
Horse, you stand still.
You're staying here with Jessica tonight,
Betsy?
- Mrs. Rand thought it might be best.
- She's right.
I've caused you so much trouble, Paul.
No, it was bound to come.
As a matter of fact, that's why I'm here.
I want to talk to you.
Perhaps when you're finished in here, you'd come into the garden.
Is it about this afternoon?
I saw the Commissioner here.
Jeffries? Yes, he was here.
He and Maxwell.
They're in a great stew about it.
Seems those people up at the houmfort... won't stop drumming and dancing till they've gotten Jessica back... and finished their ritual tests, something of that sort.
For her own safety, Jeffries and Maxwell want Jessica sent away to Saint Thomas... to the asylum.
- It might be best.
- Maybe.
But Wesley insists she stay here.
But he hasn't the right.
He hasn't any legal right, if that's what you mean.
But he says that I am responsible for Jessica's illness... that I deliberately drove her insane.
You couldn't have done that, Paul.
I don't know.
I've gone over it and over it, and I don't know.
I want you out of it.
I want you to go back to Canada, Betsy.
Why?
Because of Jessica. Because of myself.
Because I don't want you to be made miserable and unhappy.
But I want to stay.
I'm afraid it's not what you want.
I want you back in Canada.
Naturally, as my employer, you have the right to dismiss me.
Don't, Betsy.
You know that isn't what I mean.
You remember the first night I saw you?
You were looking at the sea.
You were enchanted.
But I felt I had to destroy that enchantment... make you see ugliness and cruelty.
- You were trying to warn me.
- No.
I was trying to hurt you.
It was the same way with Jessica.
I had to hurt her.
Everything she did or said made me lash out at her.
That's why I want you to go.
You see, Betsy... since you've been here...
I've seen how fine and sweet things can be between a man and a woman... how love can be calm and good.
I'd rather not have that sort of love, than have it and destroy it.
You want me to leave you?
That's why I want you to go.
It's no good for you to stay so long as I have this fear of myself.
Paul.
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.
Carrefour!
Carrefour, go back.
Paul, let him go.
Don't touch him. Don't try to stop him.
I can send this off by the next boat.
If you have any letters, you'd better get them ready... to go with this parcel.
Any news I have can wait till I get home.
It will be pretty stale by that time.
Perhaps not, Mother.
Betsy is leaving us.
Why, Betsy, we can't lose you.
We've grown to depend on you.
I have and I know Paul has.
Mother, Betsy has her reasons.
I hope you won't feel I'm deserting you or think badly of me.
Think badly of you, Betsy?
Dr. Maxwell has some unpleasant news for us.
- An accident at the mill?
- No, it's about Jessica.
A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
What about her?
In view of all the circumstances, some of the things Wesley's been saying... and the fact that one of the voodoo people got into your house last night... the Commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
In other words, I'm on trial.
I wouldn't put it that way, Paul... but there's been a lot of talk.
The whole thing's getting out of hand.
A pretty scene, half the island crowding into the courtroom... to watch our dirty linen get a public scrubbing.
Wait a bit, Wes.
Let's talk this over with the...
Talk it over! Talk now, Paul, and tell them that you're not responsible... that every bit of this doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders.
If you'll be good enough to take me to the Commissioner, Doctor.
I think there'll be no need of an investigation.
But why, Mrs. Rand?
What could you have to tell him?
Jessica is not insane.
Please take me to the Commissioner.
I can explain the whole thing to him.
Mother, what are you trying to say?
She is dead.
Now, Mrs. Rand.
She is dead... living and dead.
Mrs. Rand, you're not seriously trying to tell me that my patient is a zombie?
I'm not mad.
It's true.
- I did it.
- Mother.
Wesley, let me explain.
I wanted to so often. Now I have to.
Betsy, tell them about the houmfort, tell them what you saw there.
You must, Betsy, they'll have to believe you.
Mrs. Rand was at the houmfort... but there's nothing wrong with that.
She's gone there for years... trying to take care of those people, to help them.
I think I understand.
I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
But it was more than that, Doctor.
I entered into their ceremonies.
I pretended I was possessed by their gods.
But what I did to Jessica...
It was when she wanted to go away with Wesley.
That night, I went to the houmfort.
I kept seeing her face smiling because she was beautiful enough... to take my family in her hands and tear it apart.
The drums, the chanting, the lights.
I heard a voice speaking in the sudden silence... my voice.
I was speaking to the houngan.
I was possessed.
I told him the woman at Fort Holland was evil... and asked him to make her a zombie.
Then what happened?
I hated myself.
On the way home,
I said over and over again... there were no such people... no strange drugs...
- there was no such thing as a zombie.
- You were right.
I said it, and I made myself believe it.
But when I got here,
Jessica was raging with fever.
She was raging with fever.
A fever with a long Latin name and a bad reputation for its aftereffects... usually some form of insanity.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
You were tricked by your own imagination, Mrs. Rand.
But I am not an imaginative or fanciful woman, Doctor.
As I understand it... in order to turn a person into a zombie... whether by poison or hocus-pocus... you must first kill that person.
Is that right?
Yes.
She was feverish. She was delirious.
But I don't remember her dying... or even being in a state resembling death.
No coma, nothing.
I'm afraid you are an imaginative woman, Mrs. Rand.
Of course.
Of course.
Jessica.
Jessica.
Jessica.
She won't obey me.
Jessica!
It's the houmfort... they're trying to get her back.
But how can they?
How could they make her understand?
How would she know?
They know how.
They have charms that can draw a man halfway around the world.
Obeah tricks, magic... everybody knows that.
We may have believed all that when we were boys, Wes.
But we're grown men now.
We know it's all nonsense.
- Do we?
- Yes.
- You've forgotten...
- I have not forgotten.
I could see what was in your mind when Maxwell was talking.
Just because he didn't know about Jessica's coma... you thought everything he said was wrong... and that mother's story was right.
- That's ridiculous.
- It is true.
Why did she come out here?
How can they make her move, do anything they want?
They can make anybody do what they want.
You're thinking just as they want you to think.
That's what it's for... the conches, their cheap mummery.
Let me in.
Come with me, Jessica.
You saw that.
I saw nothing that would convince a sober man.
You better get some sleep, Wes.
Why don't you go to bed, Wes?
It's been a hard day for all of us.
I'm sorry, Wes.
I think I know how you must feel... and I am sorry.
I only wish there was something I could do.
She ought to be free.
You could free her, Betsy.
You could do it.
You're a nurse. You have the drugs.
It would be so quick.
Her heart beats. She breathes.
That's life, Wes.
I once took an oath to guard life.
I shouldn't have asked it of you.
But it was only because
I can't make you believe... that she's already dead.
Wait a minute.
There's one other thing.
You love Paul.
Then what good will it ever do you if Jessica is still...
Wesley.
I'm afraid I love him too much for that.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Lord God, most holy...
deliver them from the bitter pains of eternal death.
The woman was a wicked woman...
and she was dead in her own life.
Yea, Lord...
dead in the selfishness of her spirit...
and the man followed her.
Her steps led him down to evil.
Her feet took hold on death.
Forgive him, oh, Lord...
who knowest the secret of all hearts.
Yea, Lord...
pity them who are dead...
and give peace and happiness to the living.

Tante Berthe you sing plenty fine.
Maybe someday pretty soon you get tired being wife... to little guy like Ulysses and you marry me, yes?
No.
Not much fun being married to a man twice as old as yourself.
Oh, that will fix you Cajun Joe.
Maybe now you keep your mouth shut.
Hey your wife, she's not changed mind yet but pretty soon I'd be rich man.
For small guy, I make plenty more money than you.
Yeah Tante Berthe, she's making the money with her singing.
You good only for wash a dish.
Say, you get to be a rich man at working as foreman in swamp clearing?
Yeah, when the job hit the finish in the swamp clearing...
I take my money and get me a good pair of fishing ground in Bayou Parataria.
The work in the swamp, she is finished now.
What for you say that?
Because nobody is so crazy to work there and you know why.
No Achilles, you tell me why.
On the night when the moon is so high in the heaven... the mummy and his princess, they walk.
Crazy, foolish.
- Antoine, where he is, eh?
- Maybe the mummy got him.
The Loup-Garous, they don't want no more digging in the swamp.
I go back pick moss but I no work in the swamp, never.
- Me neither.
- I no go to the place.
- Achilles is right.
- This place, she's a haunt.
Oh waste up, you listen to me,
I know better from all of you.
I've be pearl fishing this place for over 30 year.
Long ago there was a mummy like you say and he take a girl in the swamp.
But that was 25 year passed.
Can't you people get it through your heads that the government is... draining that swamp for your benefit'?
For the sanitation and health of your families?
You know what I mean Hill, is up to you to get those men back to work.
Mr. Walsh...
We are the ones to have to understand.
These men are convinced that the swamps have got a curse on them.
Don't give me any of that childish business Hill.
You're the foreman around here.
Get those men back to work.
- Ask him where Antoine is.
- Oui, you think it's childish business.
Everybody knows the place, she is haunted.
Antoine, he disappear last night.
Maybe he went to Tante
Berthé's Cafe and got drunk.
No, no he no go to
Tante Berthe, he stay on the job.
Everybody know that work on the swamp... he catch hard luck on his family and children's children.
Too many people, they go in the swamp, they never come out.
That's nonsense and all of you know it.
When you consider Mr. Walsh, the swamp hasn't changed for hundreds of years, is...
Then is a good thing we started doing something to remedy matters.
Now, I don't care how you go about it... but get those men back on the job right away, that's all.
- I'm looking for a Mr. Walsh.
- That's me.
My name is Halsey, Dr. James
Halsey from the Scripps Museum.
How are you?
This is my colleague and associate Dr. Ilzor Zandab.
How do you do?
The Scripps Museum, eh?
Now what can I do for you?
I have a letter of introduction that will explain.
Come in the office.
I don't get this at all, besides,
I happen to be rather busy.
I merely wanted to present our credentials and ask your cooperation.
Cooperation? What for?
Well, you're head of the engineering project here.
We've been sent to recover the mummies of Kharis and the Princess Ananka...
- believed to be buried in these swamps.
- Look mister...
I've got trouble enough with these people and their superstitions.
What's more, I'm not going to be annoyed by a lot of college professors getting in my way.
Digging for mummies?
If I promise not to get in your way Mr. Walsh?
I'll advise you not to.
Dr. Halsey... has not permission been secured... by the Scripps Museum to excavate and explore these swamps?
Museum or no museum this work cannot be delay.
Mr. Walsh, you won't be delayed in the slightest.
In fact, we probably won't start until after your work is done.
And the swamp sections are drained.
In that case Dr. Halsey's expedition won't be in our way at all.
Now, you stay out of this.
Just because you're upset is no reason to be unfriendly to them.
Look, I had enough argument for one day.
You be sure and check on those requisitions for more cable and another derrick.
Good day gentlemen, I'll just be a few minutes Betty.
Thanks for helping us out. But you shouldn't talk back your boss like that.
- You're liable to get fired.
- You mustn't mind uncle Pat.
Oh, your uncle?
He isn't nearly as unpleasant as he appears to be.
Say, what makes you so sure that these mummies are buried in this swamp?
Because many years ago, the mummy carried off a girl.
Pursued by the townspeople and the sheriff's posse... he made for the swamps right in this locale.
And that Mr. Walsh, is a matter of record.
The newspaper files of The Bayou Times... carried long descriptive accounts of the event.
You expect me to believe a story as fantastic as that?
As a matter of fact, the Egyptians themselves doubt the legend of Kharis.
But nevertheless, a small group in Egypt did harbor the mummy through the centuries.
And he's been traced right here to this country.
In the dictum of the fathers it is written. Truth will flourish in fantasy... only to wither and die in what you are pleased to call reality.
Yes, and speaking of reality Ilzor, I think is time we started getting organized.
- Boss, Boss, some terrible done happened.
- What is it now Goobie?
- Antoine, they just find him dead.
- What?
At the edge of the pit, the other side of the swamp.
- These unnecessary accidents.
- Oh no sir, he was killed.
What do you mean?
And the workmen, they're getting mighty scared sir. They're going quit.
Find Cajun Joe, he knows how to handle these people.
- Yes sir.
- He's probably at Tante Berthe's Cafe.
- Bring him in a quick as you can.
- Yes sir.
Get Dr. Cooper.
Master Joe, Master Joe,
Master Walsh is looking for you.
Why he want me for?
Find a lizard on the grave, tain't no charm your life would save.
Hey, what are you talking about Goobie?
They just find Antoine in the big pit with a knife in his back.
I don't know how it could've happened with all these men working around here.
How long has he been dead Dr. Cooper?
I can't say definitely but I would judge at least 24 hours.
He must've been murdered yesterday and the body left here.
The devil is on the loose, maybe soon we'll all be killed.
Mr. Walsh, will you come here a minute?
What does that look like?
Looks like a hole in the ground.
No no, come down here and take a better look.
Hey, looks like the imprint of a man's body. A big man too.
Not an ordinary man's body Mr. Walsh, unless
I'm mistaken a mummy was buried here... until a bulldozer uncovered it.
Oh Ilzor, I want you to see this.
What do you think that is?
Might be part of a wrapping from a mummy.
But it will take a full microscopic test to make certain.
The devil is on the loose and he's dancing with the mummy.
See what I told you Joe?
The Loup Garou is plenty mad.
Only crazy people dig in the swamp.
He's right.
The swamp is haunted by the mummy.
How many time I told you, the mummy he's a no scare nobody.
Let's all stop the nonsense.
If this cloth wrapping proves authentic... whoever found the mummy must've murdered Antoine.
The whole story is fantastic.
Perhaps not as fantastic as it seems Mr. Walsh.
Joe, go into town and notify the authorities of Antoine's murder.
Master, Master.
- 'Tis you Ragheb.
- Yes Master.
The hours of the night are few.
Lead the way quickly.
Look Master...
The path leads right up the hill from the very swamp edge.
- But the mummy cases, where are they?
- Safely hidden in the monastery.
- You couldn't have carried them up alone.
- No, I've had help.
- You've been told to work secretly.
- Those who helped will not talk.
I trust you silenced them less noticeably than you did Antoine?
With Antoine I had to act quickly Master.
This time their bones will long be turned to powder before our secret is discovered.
Come, the hours do not linger.
- It is good.
- Yes Master.
My robe.
- But where is Kharis?
- Over there Master.
Kharis, you shall rise again to find your Princess Ananka.
That is our vow to you.
Kharis will soon be ready to return to life and movement.
Yes, Master.
Now, where is the copper box and the sacred brazier?
They're here.
Open it.
There you will find leaves of the ancient tana tree.
- Yes Master.
- Give three to me.
Three leaves... to keep his heart beating.
Once each night during the cycle of the full moon... we will dissolve three tana leaves and give the fluid to Kharis.
Yes Master.
Once each night during the cycle of the full moon.
And nine leaves each night to give life and movement.
Nine leaves each night to give him life and movement.
And now... by this medallion of the late priests of Arkam... you will swear to the ancient gods of Egypt... that you will not betray your trust.
I swear by the mighty power of Amon-Ra... whose anger can shatter the world... that I will not betray my trust.
Now that you've sworn... the time has come when you must learn the purpose of our mission.
You will look back with me across the years... that pass like vapor before thine eyes.
Over 3,000 years ago, the Princess Ananka died.
She was buried with all the ceremony due her exalted station.
Ananka's father, King Amenophis bid her last farewell.
And thus, the Princess Ananka was placed in her tomb.
Kharis, a prince of the royal house who loved Ananka... looked on in grief.
His devotion was so great that he refused to believe... she was lost to him forever.
Kharis broke into the altar room to steal the secret of eternal life... from its hiding place at the feet of Isis, the goddess.
With that, he knew he could bring Ananka back to life.
Daring the anger of the ancient gods, he stole the forbidden tana leaves.
Returning to the tomb of his beloved to restore her once again... to mortal state,
Kharis was discovered by guards who seized him.
For it had been decreed that whoever defiled the temples of the gods... should meet a cruel and violent death.
And never should his soul find rest... unto eternity.
Such was the curse of Amen-Ra, king of all the gods, upon Kharis.
And for the sin he had committed, he was condemned to be buried alive.
But first, they cut out his tongue... so the ears of the gods would not be assailed... by his unholy curses.
Then all trace of sinful
Kharis identity was destroyed.
And he was buried alone on a remote hill... far beyond the Valley of the Seven Jackals.
With him was also buried a great quantity of the forbidden tana leaves.
As slaves covered the accursed burial spot... a signal from the high priest moved the warriors to action.
The slaves were killed... so that they could not tell what had taken place.
Later, the priests removed
Kharis from his unholy grave... and placed him in a cave on the other side of the mountain... together with a large quantity of the tana leaves.
It was ordained by the great god Amon-Ra that Kharis... should remain immortal and that his heart should beat throughout eternity.
For his tomb guarded the passageway to the sacred resting place of Princess Ananka.
And thus, none but the priests of Arkam knew where Kharis was buried.
For over 3,000 years Kharis remained in his cave on the other side of the mountain... waiting to bring death to him who would desecrate Ananka's tomb.
For Kharis really never died.
Then why Master is he here in America?
An American archeologist seeking the tomb of Princess Ananka... by accident came upon... and dared to desecrate the burial place of Kharis.
Kharis desired to carry his
Princess Ananka back with him... but non-believing infidels have driven them into these swamps.
That I have heard.
Two high priests of Amon-Ra came to America to bring you and Ananka home to Egypt... to repose together in eternal and immortal peace.
Both of those priests have met a violent death in the attempt.
And now you Ragheb, shall help me to succeed where they have failed.
We shall fulfill our sacred duty or die by violence.
Yes Master.
You have risen Kharis, Tis well.
What does this mean?
Who are you? What are you doing here?
I am Michael, self-ordained caretaker of this monastery.
- I thought this place was abandoned.
- This house of worship... though silent for many years, is not to be desecrated by such pagan customs.
I'm afraid I shall have to ask you to take these sacrilegious things away.
- They shall remain only for the night.
- You cannot stay here another hour.
In a room beneath the chapel I found the bodies of freshly murdered men.
Never has this happened before.
- Quitting time already Goobie?
- Yes sir Mr. Ragheb, another day gone.
- You going to town tonight?
- No, not tonight.
Hey?
Hello, I no see you before. What your name?
Where you come from?
You wet, you better take my coat.
Think something happened to you.
Better come with me.
Kharis.
Kharis.
Kharis? What is this Kharis?
Maybe that's your name? Come on, I bring you to Tante Berthe. She fix you up all right.
We better not go the front door.
We go the side way to Tante Berthe.
You wait here, I go get Tante Berthe.
What do you do here in my home Joe?
- Who's she?
- I find dis poor girl in de swamps.
She's a very sick.
What is she doing here?
Hey, what is your name?
What's the matter with you? Don't just stand there, go get Monsieur Doctor.
All right, all right.
You take good care from her.
Don't worry, just get Monsieur Doctor, quick.
Go in there, I fix the bed and get you some clean clothes.
And you just rest for awhile, that's it.
The hour has come Kharis.
The moment for which you have waited so long.
Ragheb has seen your bride
Princess Ananka taken away.
Now you shall go to take her.
You know your destination.
Drink, drink from the brew of the nine tana leaves.
And any who would stand in your way, kill.
Kill.
You feel perhaps a little better.
What's the matter? You feel sick again?
I thought sure we're going to hit her.
I wonder what's happened to her and what she's doing here?
Yes, look at the way she's dressed.
What strange clothes to be wearing out in the swamp at this hour of the night.
She doesn't seem to be injured in any way.
Let's take her back to camp and have Dr. Cooper take a look at her.
You'd better sit in back with her.
Excuse me.
What's the matter here?
Where the girl? What happened?
We have a good time singing.
Ulysses come in here and...
And Tante Berthe, she on the bed.
This woman is dead. Death by strangulation.
I don't know why somebody want to kill her.
She's only sing and try to make people happy.
Funny marks in the throat.
Look like mold. Odd, isn't it'?
Poor Tame Bertha, she's a dead.
And a girl, she's a gone.
What happened to me?
I woke up and everything is so strange.
- Who are you?
- We're friends.
We found you wandering around last night.
Wandering?
Dr. Halsey and Miss Walsh brought you here.
Are you feeling better?
I cannot remember who
I am or what I'm doing here.
Do you remember Joe?
- No.
- Remember Tame Bertha?
- Tame Bertha?
- The Cajun woman.
Cajun woman.
You really only suffered a severe shock.
Now you need have no fear, just lie down.
Rest quietly and you'll be all right.
I'll drop in to see how you are later.
Now, that poor girl is definitely a victim of amnesia.
We must give her something to do.
Something to keep her mentally alert, keep her talking as much as possible.
She could help me with my laboratory work.
- I could start her tomorrow.
- That would be fine, fine.
Hello, what are you trying to do?
Develop a fine case of sunstroke?
Good morning Dr. Halsey.
I hope you do not mind my working out here.
I'd one of the men move the equipment. I love the sun.
Yes, but does it love you that much?
Or will you be shining like a boiled craw-fish in an hour or two?
I can never get too much sun Dr. Halsey.
I hope you will forgive me but I've been reading your notes.
Oh, is just a lot of technical data you probably wouldn't understand.
I do understand Dr. Halsey.
And you're right, these are mummy wrappings.
But your notes are not complete.
- Well now, that's very interesting.
- Here... see for yourself.
Notice the coarse material and the number of strands per square inch.
This fabric was woven during the dynasty of King Amenophis.
And worn by Kharis, prince of the royal house.
- Have you studied archeology?
- Archeology?
No no, at least I do not remember.
Well then, how do you know about this cloth and about Kharis?
I do not know how.
There's really no way to explain it.
Sometimes I feel as if it's all part of a... strange dream.
Say, if you're right this is terrific.
You could be a great help to me.
You know, this is...
- Ilzor, do you know this young lady?
- No sir.
Just a minute Ilzor.
Kharis.
- Kharis.
- Here, here, what do you saying?
- I'm sorry, what happened to me?
- You were calling Kharis.
Kharis?
- Was I?
- Yes.
It is the will of Amon-Ra.
This morning I tried to lead your Princess Ananka to you.
But it has been ordained that you must seek her out for yourself.
Hasten then, while the moon is still high.
Pardon me for breaking in like this,
Doctor, but I need your help.
I need help desperately.
I don't think anyone can help you in your present state of mind.
Please sit down.
He's coming for me.
- Who's coming for you?
- Kharis.
Who's Kharis?
Oh, is so hard to explain.
Is as though I were two different people.
Sometimes it seems as if
I belong to a different world.
I find myself in strange surroundings, with strange people.
I cannot ever seem to find rest, and now Kharis.
And you, you wait here.
I'll get you something to quiet your nerves.
Oh please, do not go, do not leave me please.
Listen.
You hear?
I suppose you've seen the morning paper... about Dr. Cooper being killed and the disappearance of that strange girl?
- I have.
- Well, what have you got to say about it?
I regret it very deeply but I can't see why you should challenge me.
I didn't kill Dr. Cooper.
Ever since you started fooling around here we got nothing but trouble.
First there was Antoine, then
Tame Bertha the cafe woman.
I didn't kill them either.
The same mold markings were found on Tante
Berthe's throat were found on Dr. Cooper's.
- Kharis, the mummy...
- Oh, the mummy? Oh, yes, the mummy.
See here, is hard enough to get something done with a lot of superstitious fools...
And by Jupiter, you're not going to drive the rest of them away with your mummy killings.
You're not helping matters any by ignoring them Mr. Walsh.
The mummy must be caught.
You should be willing to help me.
Help you? I'll help you all right, just you listen to this.
Betty, I want you to send a telegram to the main office right away.
Tell them that I insist the permit granted to the Scripps Museum... to excavate in these swamps, be revoked at once.
- Now just a minute Mr. Walsh...
- Uncle Pat, you can't do that.
Can't I? Just you send that telegram.
Go on, send it.
No Uncle Pat, is unfair and I won't.
- You won't?
- No, I won't.
All right, I'll send it myself.
How about that girl? Maybe she tell us something if we find her.
You're right, there must be some connection there.
That's hard to believe.
But the mummy always shows up wherever she is.
- First at Tame Bertha, then at Dr. Cooper's.
- Undoubtedly coincidence.
Just the same, I intend to try to find her and solve this puzzle.
Me too, I'll help find that poor girl.
I know these swamps like my finger.
Thanks Joe.
Get Ragheb and some of the other workmen to go along.
We'll cover every trail tonight.
Personally I think the whole search is hopeless.
Well, I don't.
Thanks for trying, anyway.
We are only wasting our time Dr. Halsey.
Ah, doesn't look like we're having much success.
Always that girl walk like she's asleep.
The swamp she's a plenty bad for people like that.
- I go and hunt till I find her.
- I don't think it will do much good.
Well, let's separate and continue the search anyway.
Hello wait, wait.
Hey...
Hey...
No.
No.
Miss Walsh...
Miss Walsh...
May I stay here with you, where there's light?
I'm so afraid of the night and the darkness.
Of course you may.
But where have you been? Dr. Halsey and the others have been looking for you.
Why did you run away after Dr. Cooper was killed?
Why are you so afraid?
I don't know.
If only you would help me find myself.
I remember being brought here to this tent.
I was very happy-
- Then he came to take me away.
- Who, who came to take you away?
The High Priest of Arkam.
You're just upset from your experience tonight.
You'll be all right after you've rested.
- What's happened Miss Walsh?
- Oh Ragheb, we must find Dr. Halsey.
The mummy, the mummy took the girl away.
The mummy? You mean you really seen him?
Yes, and that strange girl you were looking for.
She came to my tent and then the mummy came and took her away.
You were searching the swamp with
Dr. Halsey, you've got to help me find him.
He's not far from here
Miss Walsh, I will guide you.
Oh thank you, Ragheb.
- What's happened Goobie? Where's Miss Walsh?
- I don't know Master Halsey.
I done hear a funny noise a little while ago... and when I run out here, this tent was torn down.
Miss Betty sure had disappeared.
The mummy.
The mummy?
You think he take the boss's niece?
Looks that way Goobie.
I'm going to follow those tracks.
You wake up Mr. Walsh and tell him.
Master Walsh, master Walsh, get up, get up.
What's the matter? What's the matter Goobie?
The mummy is on the loose.
He's dancing with the devil.
What are you talking about?
They done broke in Miss Walsh's tent and carried her away.
- What?
- Yes sir.
Wake up Achilles and some of the boys, I'll get dressed.
Yes sir.
- How much farther is it?
- Right up there.
Our prayers to the mighty
Amon-Ra have been answered Kharis.
The Princess Ananka shall be lifted from her mortal state... and sealed in this case... and shall be returned with you to Egypt... there to be embraced by the sands of the past.
- Where is Dr. Halsey Ragheb?
- He is not here.
But you told me he...
This monastery has been abandoned for nearly 100 years.
Ragheb...
The curse of Amen-Ra upon you Ragheb.
Dr. Zandab, those robes.
- You're, you're...
- The High Priest of Arkam.
Your tongue shall be torn from your mouth for the vows you have sworn to, falsely.
- Master, I am but flesh and blood.
- You have betrayed your trust.
The secret of Kharis and his bride
Princess Ananka cannot be preserved... unless this girl dies.
No, Master.
The vultures will pick the flesh from your bones after Kharis learns of your treachery.
I too know the secret of the tana leaves.
Without the brew Kharis is powerless.
Enough.
Jim.
- Betty, what happened?
- He brought me here, I was looking for you.
Master, I meant no harm.
Betty.
- Are you hurt?
- No.
I'll get you back to camp.
Ilzor?
He's dead, what was he doing here?
Look out, Jim.
No, Kharis. No.
If you destroy me, the secret of the tana leaves will die.
Jim, Jim.
- Are you all right Betty?
- Yes, but a little shaken up uncle Pat.
Say, what on earth is been going on in here?
The wing collapsed, buried
Ragheb and the mummy.
- Master Halsey, master Halsey.
- What is it Goobie?
I don't know boss but it ain't human.
Now I understand why she knew so much about Kharis and the ancient Egyptians.
What are you talking about?
This mummy is the girl we brought to the camp.
She's the Princess Ananka.
Sure and I'm her grandfather.
We'll put a crew of men to work digging Kharis out of the rubble... then send them both back to the Scripps Museum.
They ought to put you on display too.
Well, maybe you'll clear out of the swamps now... and leave me alone so I can get a little work done.
Oh, I'll get out but you haven't seen the last of me yet Mr. Walsh.
- There's a certain secretary...
- You're welcome to her, go ahead.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Well, as a secretary you haven't been any use to me since the minute he walked in on us.
You didn't dot the I.
Whew.
Hey Joe, who's this guy Strickland?
All you news hawks hanging around here, half the guests are inquiring about him.
A fine hotel dick.
Don't you ever read anything outside The Racing Form?
Amos Strickland is the number-one criminal lawyer in the country.
Why all the excitement?
Lawyers have visited the Lost Caverns before.
Sure, but when the lawyer's Amos Strickland and he postpones an important case to come up here, something's cookin'.
Hold it, no pictures, boys.
How about a statement for Herald?
No statement, and I said no pictures.
Mr. Strickland, how long are you gonna be here?
Come on, boys, break it up, you heard the man.
Beat it, go ahead.
Who is he?
You must be Mr. Strickland.
Brilliant, you must be the hotel detective.
Jeff, Mr. Strickland.
Good evening, Mr. Strickland.
I'm sorry you were annoyed, but you know how newsmen are.
Unfortunately, yes.
Tell Mr. Crandall I'm here.
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Crandall's not in, but I'll tell his niece you're here.
She's very anxious to speak with you.
Young man, if I wanted to speak to his niece,
I'd ask for her.
The moment Mr. Crandall comes in, tell him I want to see him.
Yes, sir.
Freddie, will you show Mr.
Strickland to room 125?
Yes, sir.
Oh, my leg.
Be more careful, my good man.
I'm sorry.
- My umbrella.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, pick up my bag.
Look, look.
Look at my glasses.
They're broken.
I'll have your job for this.
Aren't you too old for this type of work?
I'll have you discharged, fired!
Pick up my bag.
Get out, you, you, you careless idiot.
Get out of here, get out.
What seems to be the trouble?
Who are you?
I'm Mr. Melton, the hotel manager.
Oh, you are, are you?
Well, look at my glasses.
Who's responsible for this?
- He is.
- What!
Well, it's your fault.
If you hadn't come here, you'd never have broke 'em.
I insist that you discharge this moron immediately.
Take off that uniform and get out, you're fired.
Fired?
Okay, I'll go.
I wanna tell you something, Mr. Strickland,
I'll get even with you for this.
Every dog has his day, and I'll have mine.
I'm gonna make you pay for this.
Are you threatening me?
In words of one syllable, yes.
Pah, pah.
So you got fired, eh?
Yes, I did, and I'm gonna tell you the same thing that I told him:
Every dog has his day.
I'll show you to your room, Mr. Strickland.
Casey, bring the bags up.
- Who, me?
- You.
The key please, Jeff.
This way.
Jeff, give me a hand, will ya?
Jeff, have you been demoted to bellboy?
No, just helping Casey.
They belong to the great Mr. Strickland.
Jeff, I told you to notify me the instant he got here.
He said he didn't want to speak to you, just your uncle.
Mr. Strickland's a man you don't argue with, he just got Freddie fired.
Betty, I said Freddie's been fired again.
What?
Oh, Freddie.
I'll speak to my uncle.
Is there anything wrong?
Not a thing.
- My key, please.
- Yes, Mrs. Grimsby.
Thank you.
Mr. Strickland, I'm sorry
I barged in like this, but I really came in to apologize to you.
I'm sorry for the way I talked to you.
Really I am, Mr. Strickland.
And I'm also sorry, Mr. Strickland, that I dropped the golf bag on your toes.
It musta hurt.
Mr. Strickland, there's somethin' else I wanna say.
I'm sorry I broke your eyeglasses.
Thanks a lot for allowing me to apologize to ya.
Mr. Strickland, now that I apologized, would you mind tellin' Mr. Melton?
Mr. Strickland, don't you think it's better if you go inside the next room?
There's a bed in there to lay down.
Hmm, it's a short walk.
Mr. Strickland.
Don't you feel well?
Uh-oh, this guy's plenty sick.
Oh.
Whew.
He made it.
Oh.
What you need is air and plenty of it, and I ain't gonna give it to ya with a little handkerchief.
I gotta give you plenty of air.
Mr. Strickland, come on, will ya.
I gotta do somethin' to help you.
Come on, I, I want.
Blood.
Blood.
He's dead.
Who did it, Mr. Strickland?
Gee, that's funny.
I always thought that if I was in a room alone with a dead person,
I'd be scared.
Ha, ha.
But, Casey!
- Hey, Mr. Melton, come on.
- Where?
- How you feelin'?
- Casey!
What's going on over here?
What's the matter, Mr. Melton?
This idiot just attacked me.
Take him out of here before he kills somebody.
Oh me, I didn't do it,
I never killed anybody.
I just happened to find the body, he was dead before I even got there.
- What body?
- Who's dead?
What are you talking about?
Mr. Strickland, he's been murdered.
Murdered?
Yeah.
Impossible, we don't permit murders in this hotel.
- Ah, Mr. Smelton.
- Melton!
The poor man, he's dead, dead, dead.
I walk in, tip my hat,.
Come here.
Excuse me.
Th-Th-Th-there he is.
- He is dead.
- Sure, he's dead.
I been tryin' to figure how to say that he's dead.
- I'll see ya later.
- Wait a minute.
Walk away, and nobody touch that body.
Touch it, I don't even wanna look at it.
Not a word of this to the guests, we must keep it quiet.
Maid, you'd better leave an extra sheet for Casey to cover up the dead body.
Dead body?
Oh!
That's enough, that's enough.
Get her quiet, and don't touch a thing.
I'm gonna call the police.
Hello?
What's the matter, what happened?
- There's been an accident.
- Is it serious?
- Murder.
- Murder!
Hello, Operator.
Get me Inspector Wellman.
Why, it's Mr. Strickland.
Jeff, take Betty to her room.
No, I don't wanna speak to the sergeant,
I wanna speak to Wellman.
That's awful.
He was such a nice man.
Do you have a handkerchief?
Yeah.
Uh-uh.
What happened?
Strickland was murdered.
He's dead.
No, no, I don't wanna speak to the sergeant,
I wanna speak to Inspector
Wellman and hurry it up.
What's going on here?
Hey.
I caught this man trying to make off with that briefcase.
I thought it might contain important evidence.
You caught me trying to get away with this briefcase?
It was him, you fibber.
How dare you call Mr. Brooks a thief?
Apologize at once, tell him you're sorry.
Apologize?
Mr. Brooks,
I'm sorry you're a crook.
- Pig head.
- Ping.
Freddie.
Mr. Melton.
Keep this as quiet as possible.
I'll put this in the safe.
Hello.
Hello, Inspector Wellman?
This is Casey, Casey of the Lost Caverns Hotel.
You'd better hop right over here, looks like we've got a murder on our hands.
Okay.
- Oh, Mr. Casey.
- Yeah?
My name's Relia, I checked in this morning.
What can I do for you, Mr. Relia?
I heard about the murder.
My gun disappeared from my room a couple hours ago.
It's registered in my name.
And if it turns out to be the murder weapon, well, I just want the police to know.
Have you any idea who took it?
Well, it could've been a maid, a waiter or a bellboy.
Bellboy, that makes sense.
Bellboys carry pass keys.
Right.
Could be a bellboy, because I was a bellboy myself and I know.
I had a passkey, I could get into every room in the place.
What am I sayin'?
Casey, search him, he may have Relia's gun on him.
- Now, listen, I mean...
- Quiet, quiet, quiet.
I don't know how I get in the middle of all these things.
"Casey, search him," hmph.
That's mine.
Nothing on him.
Mr. Smelton, or Melton, you're not gonna implicate me unless you get away with it.
Casey, I heard him threaten Mr. Strickland.
Don't let him out of your sight until the police come.
Troublemaker.
- Casey, I'm worried.
- I know.
You don't think I had anything to do with it, do ya?
No, no, but it looks bad, Freddie, it looks bad.
I know.
Course, you have two things in your favor.
Number one, they found no bloodstains on ya.
Number two, the gun that killed
Strickland is still missing.
That I'm very happy for.
Yeah, but on the other side of the ledger, all the evidence points to you.
You were seen fighting with him,
- then you lost your job.
- Yeah.
Course, that supplies the motive.
Sure.
Then you were heard threatening him, and you were seen coming out of his room.
What are you doing?
Gotta take to laundry.
Laundry, to the laundry?
Yeah.
Wait a minute, come here, just a minute.
Hey, where'd you get that gun?
I don't know.
Freddie, for the last time,
I'm going to ask you where'd you get that gun?
I don't know.
Where'd you get that gun?
That's not fair, you said for the last time,
- I answered it.
- Now, look Freddie...
You're using unfair tactics.
I'm trying to help you out.
There's no doubt this what this is Relia's gun and there's now doubt what they planted it in here.
We've gotta get it back to his room before the police come, otherwise, you're a dead duck.
Now, why would anybody want to put a thing like that in here for?
When we find that out, we'll find the culprit.
Who's the culprit?
The culprit and the murderer are the same.
Oh, they are?
Come on, come on, shake a leg.
Duck, duck.
Something sneaky about that dame.
I think you're right,
I'm gonna question her.
She went that way, over the other way.
Now, don't forget, if he's in here, just pretend we've made a mistake, shh.
Just stop.
- Ah, the wrong key.
- Try this one.
What?
Where'd you get that?
- Red.
- Red who?
Red Skelton, it's a Skelton key.
- Skelton.
- Opens up any door.
Come on.
Hey.
This guy is certainly a messy housekeeper.
This place has been searched.
I wonder if it coulda been that dame we saw down the hall.
Whoever it was did a thorough job.
I'll say they did.
Look, let's plant the gun here and get out.
Hey, wait a minute.
This is a telegram to Michael Relia.
Get a load of this:
"I'm including your case in my memoirs."
"Imperative you be at the Lost
Caverns Hotel this weekend."
"Signed, Amos Strickland."
You know, this could tie in with the murder.
I'm gonna check on this Relia.
You go see if the coast is clear,
I'll plant this gun in one of his suits in the closet.
Oh.
You didn't see me.
You didn't see me.
You didn't see me.
I wasn't here.
Okay, I planted the gun.
Come on, let's go.
Come, what's the matter with you?
- I didn't see him.
- You didn't see who?
- The man who wasn't here.
- What man?
All I did was open up the door, see if the coast was clear.
My mind went blank.
Your mind's been blank all your life.
Come on, close the door.
I said come, come on.
I didn't see him.
I'll have a coroner's report on Strickland the first thing in the morning for you, Inspector.
That'll be fine, Doc.
Now, let's see, where were we, Milford?
You said you've been
Strickland's secretary for nearly 20 years.
Over 20 years.
Know any enemies he had?
Oh naturally, Inspector Wellman, a big criminal lawyer is bound to make some enemies.
But I don't know of anyone who would've resorted to murder.
You're wasting your time, Inspector, you've got the murderer,
Phillips, the bellboy.
Mr. Melton, if you don't mind,
I'll handle this case in my own way.
Sergeant, bring that bellboy in.
Okay, Phillips, the Inspector wants you.
Now, be firm.
You just leave 'em to me,
I can handle this two guys.
Atta boy.
You can go, Melton.
Okay, Phillips.
I didn't do it, I tell ya.
Inspector, I didn't do it.
Please, please, Inspector, I didn't do it, don't hit me.
Don't hit me, don't twist my arm, don't twist my arm.
I'm innocent, I tell ya, I'm innocent.
Don't hit me on the head with a rubber hose.
Please don't, what, don't hit me on the head with a rubber hose.
Wait a minute, shut up.
What?
The man didn't touch you with his little finger.
What kind of third degree is this?
I don't give third degrees.
- Stingy.
- All right.
What's the matter with that guy, Casey?
Oh, Inspector, he's been that way all his life.
He's too dumb to commit a murder.
But I don't understand, why is he always hollerin' about rubber hoses?
Casey, show him the telegram.
What telegram, are you withholding evidence?
Oh no, no, no, Inspector.
I was going to give you this.
We found this in Relia's room.
I'll look this over later.
In the meantime, I'm releasing this bellhop in your custody.
He's not to leave this hotel.
- Oh, but I got to, Mr.
- Melton said I have to get out.
You'll remain as a guest of the state.
- A guest?
- That's right.
They pay for everything?
Inspector, if you get a chance, come up and see me sometime.
Thank you, goodbye.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, oh, just a moment, dear, it's all right.
Will you bring the phone over here, please?
Hello.
Yes.
Of course.
I'd be delighted.
Thank you.
We're gonna have a guest.
Casey, I want you to order me pheasant on the half shell.
Also order me crepes tied around Suzette, and my special order of caviar with bologna on the side.
Now look, Freddie, I know you're a guest of the state, but don't you think you're carrying this thing too far?
After all, California's a big state.
If it was Rhode Island, it'd be different.
- $8.55, Mr. Phillips.
- Can you spell California?
- Certainly.
- Sign the check, please.
If you please.
And put a big tip on for everybody.
Oh, thank you very much.
You're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome.
Goodbye now, see you tomorrow.
You won't be here tomorrow.
Yes, I will.
Wait'll Inspector
Wellman sees the report
I have on Michael Relia.
You will be just an ordinary little bellhop again.
I don't intend to be a bellhop anymore.
Mm-hmm.
Furthermore, I have a date with Angela Gordon.
- I...
- Ha, ha.
You mean to tell me that good-lookin' dame made a date with you?
- Yes.
- I don't believe it.
Angela, my Angela.
Please.
Ah, come in, darling.
Darling?
Here's your suit.
Angela, huh?
Angela.
Oh, am I intruding?
No, but he is.
Hmm-hmm.
Angela.
Won't you sit down, Freddie?
I think so.
Over there?
- Sit down?
- Please.
Gee, you're pretty.
I bet you say that to all the girls.
Yes, it don't go over so good with the boys.
You're sweet.
And to think that they suspect you of murdering Strickland.
It's ridiculous.
Yes, and if they ever give me the gas chamber, they're hangin' the wrong man, and they'll be sorry.
Have you any idea who the real murderer is?
Yes.
Who?
The culprit.
But who is the culprit?
- Well?
- The murderer.
Casey has a full report on him.
He has to find out only one thing before he can put him in jail.
- What's that?
- If he did it.
- If who did it?
- The culprit.
- Who is the culprit?
- The murderer.
Don't you understand?
Freddie, if you could prove who did it, you'll be a hero, and I just adore heroes.
Why don't you get him to sign a confession?
Get who to sign a confession?
- The murderer.
- Who's the murderer?
The culprit, don't you understand?
Yes, yes, I do.
If I get the murderer to sign a confession, that will prove that I'm innocent.
Why couldn't I think of something like that?
Ooh, if I only had a pencil and paper,
I would, you know what I would do if?
Thank you.
I'll dictate, you write.
Hmm-hmm.
Start.
I hereby confess.
- You did it?
- Oh, no, Freddie.
Write.
I hereby confess to the murder of Amos Strickland.
Now sign it.
Me sign it?
Certainly, you are the witness.
Then when the real murderer signs it, everyone will know who got the confession out of him.
Huh.
Yeah, that's right.
Freddie Phillips.
Pretty good.
Boy, will Casey be proud of me.
Oh, don't tell Casey, we'll keep it a secret.
Okay.
Excuse me, there's someone at the door.
Ah.
For me?
I took the liberty of ordering this.
- That'll be all.
- Yes, ma'am.
I thought it might be fun to have a little champagne.
Gee, I never thought
I'd live a life like this.
I've got a report on every one of ya, thanks to Mr. Strickland's secretary.
Now, you've all had enough experience with the law to know that the sooner you start cooperating, the sooner we'll get this case over with.
Okay, who's gonna speak up?
Nobody, huh?
Inspector, I've gotta talk to ya right away.
Inspector, I've cracked this case wide open,
I've got the murderer for ya: Mike Relia.
Maybe that's why we can't find him.
You got any proof?
Sure, I sent his fingerprints down to headquarters, and I've got the complete report.
You know, he was defended on a murder rap by Strickland in 1940.
Old stuff, Casey, we know all that.
Wait a minute, it matches in with the telegram he received, that's your motive.
Sure, except for one thing.
Outside of the girl, everyone in that room received a similar telegram.
And they've all got just as much to lose as Mike Relia.
- Crandall too?
- Crandall too.
Sorry, Casey, keep on tryin'.
Sergeant, send Mike Relia and Miss Gordon in here.
I've got two men looking for 'em now.
Not Angela Gordon.
Yep, she was once tried for feeding her husband champagne cocktails.
Two jiggers of champagne to one jigger of poison.
Holy smokes, she's up in Freddie's room.
I saw the champagne wagon headed that way.
They're having cocktails right now.
What?
There's a poison antidote in the doctor's office.
Let's go.
I'm hurt, Freddie.
I mixed one of my special champagne cocktails just for you and you won't even taste it.
I have a confession to make.
- You did it?
- No!
I mean that stuff, I never drink that stuff.
That's like drinking poison.
Oh, just one teensy-weensy sip.
Oh.
Oh, stop it, the bubbles is ticklin' my nose.
For little Angela.
I wouldn't drink it for big Angela.
Cut it out, will ya?
And stop pressure...
Oh, drink it.
Give me that glass, I've had enough of this, Angela.
There you are, Inspector, see, just as I told ya.
- And he drank some.
- The antidote.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Get him outta here.
- What's goin' on here?
- Quiet.
I got a date with a girl.
- What is that?
- Mustard and milk.
- Mustard and milk.
- Mustard and milk?
- Come on.
- I got a girl over here.
This is an outrage.
I told them who you are, Miss Gordon, you can stop pretending.
Why, you.
I also gave the Inspector the background on your playmates, including that fake swami from Brooklyn.
What else have you got?
- Flour and water.
- Swell.
What are you doing to me?
- Quiet, quiet.
- I gotta...
Hey.
- I'll give you the head...
- Save your strength.
When are you gonna start cooperating with us, Miss Gordon?
Inspector, I'll do anything you say, but please don't let my name get into the newspapers,
I'm engaged to be married and it would wreck my life.
What else have you got?
Sweet oil and lime.
- Swell, all right...
- Casey, Casey.
- Take it easy, Freddie.
- I'll take care of ya.
Who killed Strickland, Miss Gordon?
I don't know, Inspector.
Please believe me, if I knew anything at all, I'd tell you.
- What else you got?
- Atropin and belladonna.
Casey, Casey.
Oh, get in there, get in there.
I'll tell you, Inspector, there's nothing in that drink.
We'll find out soon enough.
In the meantime, I'm holding you.
I've tried everything, given him everything.
Nothing happened.
See?
Casey, what are you doin' to me?
Sorry about the rough treatment, Freddie, but that champagne cocktail might've been poisoned.
Poison, poison, poison?
Are you tryin' to tell me that, oh.
What are you, oh, oh.
I didn't even drink the stuff.
Well, why didn't you tell me?
Every time I opened my mouth, you kept pouring something down it.
Oh, oh.
What good is this confession if that bellboy is still around?
You've let us down, Angela.
We were all rather surprised when the police found there was nothing in the drink.
Why, you don't think
I intended to kill him.
I just wanted to get him drunk and put him on the slow boat to Shanghai or some place.
Not permanent enough, my dear, he'd come back.
If Mike Relia hadn't left, he'd know how to get us out of this situation.
Well, I've done my part,
I got the confession.
I suppose it's up to me.
This bellboy will commit suicide tonight and this will be found beside the body.
Suicide?
I have ways.
You are in a deep sleep, a sound sleep.
You hear nothing but the sound of my voice.
You will do as I say, you will obey without question.
Open your eyes.
Freddie, your future is black.
A terrible fate awaits you, you have nothing to live for.
- But you have one escape.
- Escape.
Yes, eternal sleep.
The sleep that brings peace.
The sleep that goes on forever.
I may as well be dead.
That's right, Freddie.
Stand up.
Stand up?
Obey me, do as I say.
Now walk.
Stand on the foot of the bed.
Put the noose around your neck.
Now, when I count three, jump.
One.
Two.
Three.
Sit up, Freddie.
Stand up on the floor.
Take the noose from 'round your neck.
We'll have to try something else.
Freddie, do you have a gun?
Then get it.
Do you have the gun, Freddie?
Then don't delay.
Put it to your head and use it.
No, no, no.
Maybe you'd like to select your own means of self-destruction.
How would you like to die?
Old age.
Freddie.
Come to the window.
Climb up on the sill.
Now then, Freddie, jump.
Not into the room, out of the window.
Now climb up again.
You're going to commit suicide if it's the last thing you do.
Now then, take this knife.
Use it.
Freddie.
Listen to me.
You will do as I tell you.
You will obey me without question.
Freddie, I want you to take this knife and plunge it into your heart.
Do as I say.
Amazing, even under hypnosis the will of an idiot to cling to life.
Freddie, would you plunge this knife into the heart of the man in the mirror?
Good.
Then take the knife.
Plunge it into the heart of the man in the mirror.
No, no!
No, Freddie, not me.
Not me, you fool.
The man in the mirror.
Freddie, obey me.
The man in the mirror.
- Hey!
- Freddie.
Freddie, Freddie, Freddie.
Freddie, wake up, what is this?
Gimme that knife.
What's the idea of chasing me around with a knife?
How could be chasing you, Casey, I'm in bed.
Get in.
Wait a minute.
What am I doin', I must be sleepwalkin'.
What's the meaning of this?
I must've walked on the ceiling too.
Hmm-hmm.
Casey, what a dream I had.
Never mind your dream.
Relia's run out, and we've gotta find him and make him talk.
Now, put on your clothes while I wash my hands.
Hurry up.
How'd I ever make it up there?
I must've come up this way, up this side wall and guess walked over that way.
Probably got chewing gum on my feet.
Hi.
Casey.
Casey, Casey!
What's the matter?
What's the matter, what's this all about?
- What are you do.
- Casey.
What are you trying to say?
Get out of the way.
It's Mike Relia.
He's dead.
He's been stabbed.
Now, you didn't do this while you were sleepwalking, did ya?
I wouldn't kill anybody, you know that.
I know it, but do the cops know it?
They find this out, it'll be curtains for you, boy.
We've gotta get this body back into its own room.
- What'll we do?
- Yeah, what'll we do?
Yeah, what'll we do?
I'll get a laundry cart, you get that body out of there.
Well, come on, get some life into it.
Don't you think that's askin' a little too much?
Come on, Freddie, we've gotta get this body back to its room.
I still don't know why
I can't wear my brown suit.
Oh, that's so nobody'll recognize you when you're pushing this cart down the corridor.
Now, come on, make it snappy.
Come on.
Come on, Freddie, let's get rid of this body.
Come on, come.
Freddie.
Freddie, where are ya now?
- Freddie.
- Here I am.
Come on.
How am I?
- Oh, hello Casey.
- Hello, Inspector.
Maid, would you get me an extra bath towel?
I'd be delighted, yes.
Get a bath towel for the inspector.
By the way, any news on the murder, Inspector?
I'm expecting a phone call from Stone that'll pin it on that bellboy.
You're keepin' an eye on him, aren't you?
Yes, everything's in hand.
I say, everything's in hand.
Hurry up with that towel.
The dumbest maid we have in the hotel.
I've been speaking to the boss in regards to firing her several times, but nothing happens.
Maybe she knows where the body's buried.
I don't know.
Here's your towel.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
My phone.
Come on, come on, push.
Hey, shall we dump him in bed?
Oh, certainly not, let's put him in the closet.
Let somebody else find him.
Closet.
Open it up, hurry, put the light on.
Thatta boy.
Come on, push it in.
Atta boy, put him right up on the shelf here, will ya.
I'll get the sheet off him.
Take it easy.
Chin up.
Give me a hand over here.
Get it, quick.
All right, come on, let's get outta here.
Come on, hurry up.
Turn out that light.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
If they find that cart in there,
Wellman might tie this up to you.
- Go get the cart.
- Go get the cart.
- Go get the cart.
- Go get the cart.
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- Come on, come on.
- That's all I do.
Go get the cart.
It's all I do is all the work.
Come on, come on.
Come on, hurry up.
Get it out there.
Come on, make it snappy.
- Move it right in here.
- Okay.
Before somebody comes along and catches us.
That's right, get rid of it.
Hey, put it right in there.
Push it, push it.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Close the door, close the door.
- That's a load off my mind.
- Oh boy, and how.
Come on, so, are you excited?
Oh boy.
Am I glad that's over with.
I want to thank you for everything.
You know, we were in a mess there for a couple minutes.
Yes.
Now, get right out of that disguise, and hurry up.
Here, I'm tired out, I'm gonna lie down for a while.
Take care of these things and don't disturb me.
Casey!
Didn't I tell you not to disturb me?
And you haven't hung up my hat and coat yet.
What's the matter with you?
I can't depend on you at all anymore.
No, no!
Where's the cart, where's the cart?
- Right there.
- Oh.
Scared you, didn't it?
Mm-hmm, I'll confess.
- You did it?
- Oh, certainly not.
Ya big dope.
It's Milford, Strickland's secretary.
What's he hangin' around here for?
He's dead, ya dope.
We've gotta get this body out of here,
- get the cart ready.
- Okay.
- What's the matter now?
- Right there.
It's Relia.
Hey, wait a minute, we just left him down in his room.
There's something funny going on here.
- Uh-huh.
- Dead men can't walk.
This one did.
He did, he did.
What are we going to do now?
I don't know.
We can't go back to Relia's room.
No.
We might bump into the Inspector again.
Yeah.
- I got an idea.
- What?
We can take 'em both down to the card room, there's nobody playin' cards at this hour of the night.
We take 'em down there and dump 'em off.
Good idea, kid, good idea.
Come on, give me a hand with this body.
- Casey.
- What?
Maybe they don't play cards.
Maybe they don't, will you talk sense, please?
Get these bodies out of here.
Come on.
Oh, oh maid.
Say, you're new here, aren't you?
Yes, it's my first night.
Well, you certainly must have been busy.
Mmm.
Look at all this laundry.
Don't do that, don't do that, you.
Say, you know something?
You're kinda cute.
Look, why don't you let your work go for a while and stay down here and keep me company.
Things have been awfully dead around here tonight.
Much deader than you think.
Oh, you.
Oh no, you don't, now.
Don't do it.
Hey.
What's going on here?
It's getting so that a poor working girl isn't safe anymore.
Oh, excuse me, the desk phone.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Come on now, get rid of these bodies.
Okay, I'll get 'em out.
What are you talking that way for?
I don't know, I'm all mixed-up.
Get rid of the bodies.
Who?
Freddie Phillips, the bellboy?
No, Inspector Wellman, I haven't seen him.
No, sir, nobody's left the hotel tonight.
Casey?
Oh yes, he's down here now.
Oh, you'll be down, okay.
Let's get out of here.
Uh-oh, here comes Abernathy.
Come on, get rid of that.
There's nothing like a nice, sociable game of bridge.
Oh, I love bridge.
Bridge?
With two open hands?
Oh, we're playing with two dummies.
Mm-hmm.
Hold on, there's a card on the floor, his hand's dead.
They're both dead.
Oh no, you don't, no, that's peeking.
Oh, he's always cheating.
- Have you got a match?
- Mm-hmm.
Here's a match.
Here, here.
Who got the bid?
She did.
- What'd she bid?
- Grand slam.
You bid a grand slam on that hand?
Yes.
You know what?
What?
You're going to get murdered.
Excuse me.
You oughta have me for a partner, the one you've gots a stiff.
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to get you all excited that way.
Really, I didn't.
You know I wouldn't do that for the world, don't you?
You know that.
Get your hand off me.
Get your hand off me!
I am partially engaged.
Now, you leave me alone!
No more.
No, what's the matter?
I wanna talk to you, come here.
You're so strong.
Now that you dragged me out here, what do you want?
How 'bout a little smack?
Hmm?
You know, just a little smack.
Mm-hmm.
Hm.
What happened?
Well, he asked for a smack, so I gave it to him.
Get that wagon outta here, change those clothes,
I'll go out and see if the coast is clear.
Okay.
Sorry, fellas, but you'll have to play two-handed.
Here comes Wellman and Stone.
Casey, I been lookin' for you.
Where's that bellboy?
- What bellboy?
- Freddie.
Oh, Freddie, I know, Freddie
Kitzmeyer from Philadelphia.
Now there's a regular kid.
I mean Freddie Phillips.
Freddie Phillips?
You mean that little, round, chubby sort of,
- with the black hair?
- That's right.
The bellhop?
He was fired.
I know he was fired.
What are you tryin' to pull?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
For a minute, I thought you were tryin' to hide somethin'.
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.
Where's Phillips?
I wish I knew.
What a detective.
I told you not to let
Phillips out of your sight.
Well, he's too fat to slip down a rat hole, where is he?
Now Inspector, I've told you 10 times, I don't know.
Maybe he's up in his room.
No, we stopped there on our way down here.
Stone, phone headquarters, tell 'em to get a dragnet out.
- Hey, you.
- Yes?
Yes!
You and I are gonna have a little talk.
I agree with you, let's talk over here some place where I, we'll talk right here.
Let's go upstairs, it's more comfortable.
I don't wanna go upstairs, my room's a mess up there.
All right, Phillips, what do you know about the murder?
Which one, there was three of 'em.
Three of 'em, there was a papa bear, a mama bear and a teeny...
Never mind the fairy tales.
Why did you kill Strickland?
I didn't kill him.
I told you boys that before, he's too dumb.
Yeah, well, what do you call this?
Could be ashes.
Right, we found it in this guy's room.
Had it analyzed, it's the remains of a linen handkerchief.
Well now, a burned handkerchief can't prove anything.
It does when our tests proved that it had blood stains on it.
I burned it.
Oh, so you admit it?
- Oh no, you see, Mr.
- Strickland, he was in the room, he was layin' there dead.
I don't know anything like that.
I saw the handkerchief right over there.
Wait a minute.
I had the handkerchief in my hand.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I ain't got any sense.
I thought maybe everybody'd think I was the murderer.
- A handkerchief.
- Yeah, the handkerchief.
Might have had a monogram on it or a laundry mark.
Yeah, it could've.
That one piece of evidence could have led us to the murderer.
I think it has.
You stop looking at me.
Don't jump at conclusions, Sergeant.
Let's go upstairs and talk it over peacefully.
No, no, now stop, no, stay here.
Tell us one thing, Phillips.
Were you and Relia in cahoots?
The last time I saw
Relia, he didn't talk to me.
Could only find Relia,
I could make him talk.
If you could, it'd be a good trick.
He can make him talk, you don't know Wellman.
You don't know Relia.
Quit stallin',
I think he's hiding upstairs in your room.
- There's nobody there.
- Let's go up and find out.
Might be a good idea, let's ride up and find out.
I'm done, I'm done.
Are you coming with me?
I'm comin'.
I'm such a young boy, too.
Hey fellas, you can come up now.
Come on, stick with me.
Blood.
Take it easy, lady, pull yourself together.
What happened?
I've been trying to get in here all evening, but no one answered.
So, I finally let myself in and then I saw that.
- Whose room is this?
- Mr. Milford.
Strickland's secretary, huh?
This case is gettin' screwier every minute.
You go to your room, I'll call you if I need you.
Any of you people seen Mr. Milford in the last few hours?
I was in the lobby quite late, I didn't see him go out.
Okay, we'll start with you, Swami.
What are you doing fully dressed at this hour?
Just a little game of cards with Mr. Brooks.
- And you?
- I was the third hand.
And naturally, you two were there?
- Naturally.
- Naturally.
Oh, that makes it pretty convenient, doesn't it?
One for all and all for one as far as the alibis are concerned.
- And you, Mr. Crandall?
- I couldn't sleep.
I went out for a walk.
Do we take your word or did somebody see you?
I was with him.
You people can go back to your rooms.
Not you, Phillips or Casey.
The rest of you stay here.
- What about me?
- You can go.
You too, Wilson.
I'd like to remain, if I may, Inspector.
You see, the reputation of the hotel is involved.
Okay.
Betty.
I don't get it.
Why didn't you want me to tell him we were out on the terrace together?
Please don't ask me, Jeff.
And thanks for not giving me away.
Someone in this room knows a lot more than he or she is admitting, and I intend to find out who it is.
Are you making an accusation, Inspector?
Maybe.
You all had a motive for killing Strickland, to prevent his memoirs from being published.
Last night he was murdered.
Tonight, his secretary disappears.
Maybe he's still alive, maybe he isn't.
He isn't.
How do you know?
Because, I mean,
'cause that spot on the carpet, that ain't ketchup there.
Well, it could mean that
Milford has been murdered.
On the other hand, it might be a red herring.
Oh no, that's not red herring, that looks more like borscht.
You don't have to waste any more time, Inspector.
You've got your murderer.
I thought so too, Mr. Melton, but Phillips has come up with an airtight alibi.
Thanks, Inspector.
Did you hear that, Casey?
I got an airtight alibi.
I'm going to locate Milford and Relia if I have to take this hotel apart with my own hands.
Nobody leaves this hotel without my permission.
You can all go now.
Not you, Casey.
Oh, not you, Casey, huh?
I'm sorry you're one of the suspects.
I'll do everything I can to get you out, though.
Phillips, I want to talk to you.
- Me?
- Yeah.
You're in this thing up to your neck, but there was something phony about that bunch of creeps bein' fully dressed at this hour, so I'm gonna give you one more chance to clear yourself.
Now look, I'm getting sick and tired of everybody accusing me of murder.
You could be the murderer, yourself.
What are you trying to do, get away?
- Shut up!
- Casey, Casey!
- Now, take it easy.
- You promised.
- Now listen to me.
- Talk to him, Casey.
As long as Phillips was under suspicion, the real killer, if he wasn't Phillips, felt safe.
But now he's gonna be pretty anxious to get that handkerchief back.
So, Phillips, you're gonna put the handkerchief up for sale.
Who's gonna buy a lot of ashes?
Nobody but us knows that you burned it.
Hey, I get it, I get it.
I get it too.
The one that buys the handkerchief
- is the murderer.
- Exactly.
Oh.
So spread the word around that you've got the handkerchief and that you'll sell it for, say about $5,000.
Sure.
And don't try to blow in the meantime.
You sure you're smart enough to handle this?
- Him?
- I'm plenty smart.
I'm going up to my hotel room right now, figure the whole thing out.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Where's your hotel key?
- In my pocket, where I.
- Is that so?
I had it.
- Here it is.
- Oh.
I didn't get this for nothing, you know.
Here it is.
Hey, come on.
Where'd you ditch the bodies?
- In the elevator.
- In the elevator?
- In the elevator.
- Come on.
We gotta get rid of those bodies.
Not that one, this one over here.
There's no bodies in there.
That's what I'm trying to tell you, some dirty crook stole 'em.
Well, at least we're rid of 'em.
Now we've got to find someone who's willing to pay $5,000 for that handkerchief.
Now, wait a minute, Casey.
Suppose the murderer hasn't got the money?
Well then, they're apt to murder you to get it back.
Either way, they'll show their hand.
Well, if they murder me, I'm apt to be killed.
That's right.
But at least you've proven your innocence.
- That's true.
- Sure.
One way or another, I can't lose.
- That's right.
- Ain't I a lucky stiff?
Lucky stiff, I should've never left Paterson.
Come on, let's go upstairs.
I tell you, I don't need a handkerchief.
I have plenty.
But I'll let you have this handkerchief very cheap, only $5,000.
$5,000, you're insane.
Oh, but it's such a beautiful handkerchief.
It's really nothing to sneeze at.
Neither is $5,000.
Oh please, please buy the handkerchief.
If you do, I'll let you have it very cheap,
I'll let you on the easy payment plan,
$3500 down and small monthly payments.
- 15 months.
- No.
- 18 months.
- No.
21 months is as far as I can go.
- No.
- No.
Ay, yi.
- How'd you make out?
- Oh, no good.
Listen, nobody wants to buy that handkerchief.
It's cheaper to kill me.
I wish they'd quit stallin' and get around to it.
They're getting around to it, all right.
Oh look, it's only a kitten.
Bet somebody's puttin' him up to it.
Better luck next time.
Now they got the Indians after me.
Hey paleface, give me my arrow.
You.
Another false alarm.
I wish somebody'd do something to you,
I'm becoming a nervous wreck.
Disgusting, isn't it?
Have you talked to everybody about that handkerchief?
Everybody but Mr. Brooks.
Brooks, I just saw him going in the health club.
Say, Freddie, this is your last bet.
If he's the killer, you'll be vindicated.
If he's the killer,
I'll be perforated, assassinated, exterminated and marinated.
Well, that's that.
Just a little longer, Mr. Brooks.
All right.
Right here, Freddie.
- This my stall?
- That's right.
- Hello, Mr. Brooks.
- Hello.
Takin' a steam bath, huh?
Naturally.
You know, for a steam bath to do you any good, you gotta stay in here at least 10 minutes.
You gotta find something to do while you're here.
Wanna play cards?
Mr. Brooks, do you catch many colds?
No, why?
Psst-psst, I got a handkerchief
I'd like to sell you.
Cheap.
Why, that's ridiculous.
Hmph.
That's enough.
You know, Mr. Brooks, the way you're perspirin' now, you could use that handkerchief.
It's a big one.
I'll take my rubdown in my room, Bozzo.
Okay, Mr. Brooks.
I'll get you in a minute, Freddie.
Okay, Mr. Bozzo.
Mr. Brooks!
I'd like to talk to you for another minute.
Oh, ho, you.
Guy never gave me a chance to cut my price.
He coulda chiseled me a little bit.
That's all.
If you.
Casey!
Inspector, I still say, if you let me sweat that bellhop a little,
I'll get a confession out of him.
Okay, if nobody falls for the handkerchief gag, he's all yours.
There's still a chance that Brooks is the killer.
Freddie's working on him now.
Well, you got until tonight to prove it.
There's a train goin' outta here at nine o'clock, and that bunch of creeps are plannin' to take it.
You're not gonna let 'em, are you?
They know as much about the law as I do.
I've either gotta book 'em or let 'em go.
I haven't got a thing on 'em.
Help, help!
The hotel's burning!
Hey, it's the health club.
Freddie's in there, come on.
Freddie, Freddie.
Hey Casey.
Freddie, where are you?
Casey.
Wait'll I turn off the steam.
Get him out of there, quick.
Whew.
How do you like that, somebody's trying to cook my goose.
What do you mean?
I saw a hand come around the corner and he put on a lot of steam.
A lot of steam, all the steam he could put on.
Full force.
I think somebody's trying to kill me.
Sounds phony to me.
Yeah, maybe you're just tryin' to divert suspicion for yourself.
You're not as dumb as you look.
Get your hand off me.
Now, I've had enough of you, Inspector.
I don't want anymore of this from you.
After all, I'm a citizen and I'm a taxpayer, and it's my taxes that buys you your gun and your badge.
And it's my taxes that also pays you your salary every week.
You're workin' for me.
You're nothin' but a public servant.
So what?
Get me another bottle of water.
Okay.
What!
Well, the Inspector's not foolin' with you anymore.
You heard what he said, if nothing develops by nine o'clock tonight, he's gonna place a formal charge of murder against you.
Murder?
So what, are you nervous?
- Murder?
- Gimme the key.
Absolutely.
Wait a minute.
What's wrong?
Stand back.
Get in, get in.
What's the matter with you?
What in the world is that?
- It's a booby trap.
- What for?
For boobs.
I'm not taking chances of anyone sneakin' in here and killin' me without me knowing it.
Ah, ya big dope.
What's to prevent anybody from coming in those French doors?
Ah.
It's pretty good, isn't it?
That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen.
- Is that so?
- Yeah.
Well, let me tell you something, if the murderer comes in this room by himself, somebody else is gonna carry him out.
Why, you dirty double-crosser.
Here we've got it all arranged to have somebody try and kill you, and you're trying to prevent it.
Ya know.
Come here, come here.
Look at this,
I suppose you've got these windows rigged up too?
Oh, they can't hurt me here.
We're three stories up.
Boy, are you lucky.
Somebody's finally trying to bump you off, congratulations.
Wait until the Inspector hears about this.
Oh boy, oh boy.
Yeah, yeah, get me Inspector Wellman.
Oh, look at those bullet holes, marvelous, wonderful.
Casey, why is everybody so happy I'm gonna be killed?
Boy, are they really after you.
Oh, come, come, put a smile on your face.
That's a boy.
Sure, enjoy life.
That's it.
Go on, go in the other room and lie down.
Go in and rest.
- Relax, go ahead.
- I will.
Sure, go ahead.
That's swell.
What, he's not in his room?
Well, page him in the lobby.
Everybody's so happy
I'm gonna get murdered.
I don't understand nothin' about the whole thing.
Uh-oh.
Every time I open up one of those closet doors,
I always find a dead body.
Is there anybody in there, hmm?
Ah.
Ah.
Casey?
Casey.
I didn't hear you come in.
You're supposed to be out there talkin' to Inspector Wellman.
Now, you know, people all around here, they're all dyin' to kill me, and here you come in resting.
Oh you, Casey.
You oughta be ashamed, you oughta be embarrassed.
That's why you got your face all covered up.
Now, come on.
Now, Casey, what was the matter with the dark suit?
You look good in that one.
Fine.
What's the matter, what's the matter, Freddie?
Freddie, what's wrong, what happened?
- Come in.
- Take it easy.
I wanna show you something.
- Take it easy.
- There he is, over there.
It's all right, so you messed up the bed.
What about it, go and relax.
No, he was here.
- Who?
- Milford.
Milford.
Now wait a minute, are you trying to tell me that Milford's body was there and it's gone?
Take care of yourself, take it easy.
Go get yourself a drink of water.
Yeah, that'll fix you up, go ahead.
Take it easy, take it easy.
Don't get excited, go ahead.
Wait a minute, what's the matter now?
- Now what?
- Milford.
Where?
Must be a leak in the tub.
Oh, come here.
Keep quiet.
There's nobody in this suite.
Now, shut up.
Just to satisfy ya, I'll check.
You get on the phone and see if the Inspector's on his way up.
Hurry up, go on.
All right, all right.
That boy don't know what's goin' on here.
He don't know what's happening.
I know I saw it in there before.
And when I go back, it ain't there.
And I was in the other room over there,
I went in to gargle my throat, and I go down like that, I saw it.
I saw it was in the bathtub over there.
I know I'm not losin' that, I know that.
I could be havin' halluc, with the nation, halluke-inations, but I know I saw it.
Hello?
Hello.
What's a matter now?
What are you, what are?
Come here.
Come on, let me in on it, now what?
What?
Oh, no, no, not again.
You mean to tell me that Milford was there?
- He was there.
- Oh.
Now, listen.
I am getting sick and tired of this nonsense of yours.
- He was there.
- Don't tell me that.
Milford was there, Milford was there, Milford was there.
How could he be, the man is dead.
For a dead man, he's sure gettin' around.
Listen, I'm gonna prove to you once and for all that he's not here.
Is he there?
No.
Come here, come here, is he there?
- No.
- No.
Come here, come on.
All right.
- Is he there?
- Yes.
- Milford!
- Cover it up.
There's something strange goin' on here.
Somebody's tryin' to scare you out of this room.
- I know who it is.
- Who?
Him.
That's the Inspector.
We've gotta get rid of him before he finds this body in here, come on.
Come on.
Hello Inspector, I'm sorry to have bothered you, but I found out it was all a mistake.
It was just his imagination.
That's right, Inspector.
You see those three bullet holes in the window?
That's only my imagination.
That's all.
Where were you when these shots were fired?
I was sittin' right here, but not for long.
Mike Relia!
Casey, do you think
I'm in the right room?
Yes.
Stone, go in the bedroom and get a sheet.
Not in the bedroom, not that one.
- Shut up.
- Sure.
- Shut up.
- Shut up.
I ain't said nothin'.
Well, Phillips, what do you know about this?
Oh, sure, sure.
What do you know about this?
Quit stallin', now you got two murders to explain.
Better make it three, Inspector.
Milford.
I pulled the spread down and there he was.
Freddie.
No, Freddie couldn't have done this, Inspector.
These bodies were planted here.
That's right, this one was planted over here, it was...
Hey.
Look, Inspector, I don't understand the whole thing.
In the suite here, I got every door locked, you can't get in or out.
That whole room in there is all laid with booby traps.
I'll prove it, come on,
I wanna show it to you.
Come on, everybody.
Look, Inspector.
What in the world is that thing?
Well sir, I'm gonna show you how it works.
Look, you see, while I go outside and leave my room, as soon as I go outside,
I leave the door open just a little bit, and I reach in with my hand and I take this and I put it on the doorknob like that, you get it?
Now, if somebody should happen to come in, the door opens up, pulls this down like this, this pulls this down and quaff, hits you right on the head.
Then I got French doors over there, but I got 'em all rigged up.
I'm not worried about these windows because nobody can come in, we're three flights up.
And that door over there, that leads to Mr. Crandall's apartment.
And Mr. Crandall's a neat man, he wouldn't leave any bodies lying around.
I'm afraid he did this time.
Phillips is telling the truth.
I brought those bodies in here.
Is that a confession, Crandall?
Pf course not, my uncle had nothing to do with the murders.
Excuse me, Inspector.
Are you the guy that's been playin' hide-and-seek with Milford and me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I found the bodies in my room,
Inspector, I got panicky.
There was no other place,
I brought them here.
How could you find the bodies in your room?
I put 'em in the elevator.
Zip it!
Now you put your foot in it.
That's good enough for me.
Frederick Phillips, I place you under arrest for the charge of willful and premeditated homicide.
Thank you, Mr. Crandall, Miss Crandall,
I may want to talk to you later.
Fine, Inspector.
Okay, Phillips, spill it.
Why did you kill those three men?
I didn't kill 'em.
I don't go around killin' people.
But all the evidence points to me.
Take me down.
Freddie Phillips.
What did you say, Inspector?
That wasn't me.
Freddie Phillips.
Did you call me?
Freddie Phillips.
Freddie Phillips.
Hey, it's comin' from over here.
Freddie Phillips.
Did I scare you with the bodies?
- You sure did.
- Shh.
Then listen carefully.
If you don't want to die, come to the caverns at 7:30 tonight.
Bring the handkerchief.
I'll be on the west bank of the bottomless pit.
Tell nobody and come alone.
Come alone, come alone.
Persistent, isn't he?
That's a phonograph record.
It's probably homemade, it's coming from the basement.
Anyone recognize the voice?
I don't know anybody who lives in there.
Inspector, I think our plan has finally worked out.
Freddie'll go to the caverns tonight and he'll catch the murderer red-handed.
Freddie, this is the last chance to clear yourself.
I'm not gonna go down to the caverns all by myself, I'm afraid.
Wait a minute.
Would you rather die a hero or live like a rat?
- Well?
- Get the cheese ready.
Casey, look.
It says do not enter.
Shucks, just when I was lookin' forward to goin' in there.
Well, I guess that's that.
Mm, mm, mm.
Freddie, you go ahead alone, it's nearly 7:30.
It's dark in here.
Go ahead, we won't be far behind ya.
And when you find the guy that wants that handkerchief, yell.
Go ahead, go ahead.
Do I have to?
Yes.
Pardon me, are you the man that wants to buy the handkerchief?
You.
Now, where could he have gone so quickly?
Freddie, hey!
- What is that?
- Oh, it's only an owl.
Let's find Freddie before something happens to him.
Come on.
Well, what do we do now?
Looks like the killer's outsmarted us.
We've gotta get to Freddie.
There's another entrance to the bottomless pit about a half-mile down, come on.
Let's go down.
What's the matter?
I turned my ankle.
You'll have to go on without me, boys.
You can't miss it, it's the first big turn to your left.
Go ahead, boys, I'm going back to the hotel.
Casey!
Casey!
Casey!
Casey!
Was that an echo?
Was that an echo?
Inspector Wellman, Sergeant Stone, Casey, are you still behind me?
Inspector Wellman,
Sergeant Stone, Casey, are you still behind me?
I'm all alone.
Oh no, you're not.
Oh, yes.
Hmm.
Wow.
That's the biggest thing I ever saw.
"Beware of bottomless pit."
"If lost, do not wander around."
"Call for guide."
Mr. Guide.
Mr. Guide.
I'll sit here and wait for him.
Oh, I wish the guy that wanted that handkerchief would come and take me outta here.
I don't like it here.
A movin' rock.
Hm.
I gotta get another candle.
Hmm.
Come on.
It ain't gonna work, not that one.
Hey, hey.
Ah.
Ah.
I'll get another candle.
Hey, mister.
Hey!
What happened?
Whoa.
Whew.
Careful, careful, I say.
Hang on.
Hang on, Freddie.
Get up here and I'll help you.
Come on.
A little closer.
Take my hand.
Give me the handkerchief and I'll save your life.
You save my life and I'll give you the handkerchief.
No.
I'll.
Whew.
This could've been serious.
Casey, oh Casey.
Wow.
Hoo-hoo.
Oh, Casey!
Inspector Wellman!
Hang on.
Catch the rope.
Throw it down, will ya?
Atta boy, good work.
Good work, if I can catch it.
Get.
Ay-yi.
Hey, get the rope a little closer!
Can ya get the rope a little closer!
Atta boy!
Oh, why do ya?
Why do ya keep on?
Why don't you make up your mind!
Hey, I think my coat is caught.
Woo.
I did it, I,.
Whoa.
Tie it around your waist.
Yeah, yeah.
Are you ready?
Okay, okay, first floor.
Freddie!
Freddie Phillips!
Now, I'll have the handkerchief.
I haven't got it.
But if you get me outta here,
I'll take you where it is.
It's in my room, I'll take you there.
I'll find out where.
What are ya doin'?
What are ya doin'?
What are ya doin'!
In two minutes, the water will be over your head.
Casey!
Casey!
Casey!
Casey!
Where are you, Phillips?
I think it came from over there.
Inspector Wellman!
A fine way to end up, a drain plug.
He isn't in here.
Look.
Where's Casey?
Nevermind Casey, did you see who the killer was?
The killer did it.
Did you see who he was?
No, he had a slicker on and a mask on his face.
What about the handkerchief?
I told him it was in my bedroom.
Come on, we've still got a chance to nab him.
Oh, oh, ho, my trap, it worked.
I got him, I got him!
My trap got the killer.
Come on, get it up.
Ho, ho.
I knew it was gonna work.
Get that killer up.
Casey.
You lunatic, why didn't you tell me you reset that thing?
I set that trap to catch the killer.
Oh, so you must be the killer.
Nonsense.
What are you doin' up here, anyway?
My ankle hurt, I come up to lay down.
That's a likely story.
You come up here to get the handkerchief.
- You're crazy.
- Is that so?
Well, it's all beginnin' to add up now.
Casey, you're tryin' to frame me.
You're the only guy who was in the room here with me when the body was being moved around.
Shh.
Not only that, I wouldn't put it past you if it wasn't your voice that come outta the ventilator.
Well you dope, you were standing right alongside of me.
So, you're a ventriloquist, huh?
Look Freddie, don't talk like that, I'm your friend.
My friend?
You're tryin' to kill me.
Inspector, I demand that you arrest this homicidal maniac.
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
There's nothin' I can do to help you now.
Freddie, stop puttin' ideas in the Inspector's head.
He doesn't need to, and I'm glad you're all here.
It saves the trouble of me sendin' for you.
Come on in and sit down.
Sergeant.
- Casey's the murderer.
- Shh, quiet.
Caught him red-handed all by myself.
No help whatsoever from the Inspector.
- Shh, quiet.
- I caught him.
Caught him all by myself.
Mr. Melton, the murderer.
Will you stop that?
I've known for some time why
Amos Strickland was killed:
To keep him from finding out that his secretary Milford had been blackmailing Crandall.
- Milford?
- Exactly.
Amos Strickland knew nothing about it.
When you phoned him that you wouldn't pay another penny, he came down here, not to put the pressure on, but to find out more about it.
But Milford couldn't have killed Strickland, he was 400 miles away.
So he must've been working with somebody in this hotel, someone who was a partner in the blackmail.
Casey, blackmailer.
Now I know how you can afford to smoke them 20-cent cigars.
You killed Strickland so he couldn't get to Crandall who had the goods on you.
- Freddie.
- Ah, ah, ah.
Freddie, you shouldn't talk like that.
After all, we're cousins.
We have the same blood in our veins.
Yes, and I wanna keep mine.
Milford knew Strickland was going to be killed, so he rounded up a few former clients to have them on the scene in order to throw suspicion in many directions.
Please.
What about the memoirs?
They were a fake.
Milford invented them to get you down here.
Strickland had no intention of retiring.
And any lawyer that would publish a book like that could never expect to get another client.
Pretty cute, eh?
You and Milford?
I wanna tell you somethin',
I'm glad they caught you.
Look Freddie, please, please.
See that folks, you see that?
- He's tryin' to choke me.
- Freddie!
You see that, he don't know his own strength.
Freddie.
Did you see it that time?
Like that, ah.
When Relia disappeared,
I suspected that he was
Milford's accomplice.
But when both Relia and
Milford were found dead,
I knew that I had to look some place else.
And you're lookin' at him now.
Stop that.
Freddie, believe me, I'm innocent.
You're innocent?
You're innocent?
Well, let me tell you somethin'.
I forgot what I was gonna say, you lucky boy.
Why Relia was murdered is one of the angles of this case that still puzzles me.
I have a theory, Inspector.
You remember the murderer stole
Relia's gun for the killing.
Well, perhaps Relia found out about it and had to be put out of the way.
A brilliant deduction, Mr. Melton.
You're right, Inspector.
Yeah, it was Casey.
He put the gun in my room so everybody would be suspicious of me.
But Inspector Wellman, why did the killer take the bodies from the elevator and leave them in my uncle's room?
- Well.
- That was very obvious.
Oh, will you shut up.
You tell it to her.
When Phillips was no longer under suspicion, the killer hoped to make Mr.
Crandall number one suspect.
See?
I'm glad that's cleared up.
Me, too.
Now at this point, the killer's only remaining problem was to recover the incriminating handkerchief.
The handkerchief!
That's it, Casey come in here lookin' for the handkerchief and he couldn't find it.
A very clever deduction, Freddie.
I think so.
Except for one thing, Mr. Melton.
Casey was one of the few of us that knew there was no handkerchief.
Phillips had burned it.
Inspector, I found what we were looking for.
Thank you, Sergeant.
I have a confession to make.
- You did it?
- Oh, no, no, no.
I kept you here in order to to give Sergeant Stone a chance to go through your rooms and luggage.
Now, there's mineral mud in the caves, so whoever was in there a few minutes ago would have it on their shoes.
All right, everybody, get back against that wall.
Quick!
Don't try anything,
Melton, you can't get away.
I think I can.
Are you going out that door?
- I am.
- A-ha, ha.
That's in case the big one didn't work.
Well, there he is, Inspector.
Get him outta here.
Well, now that I solved the murder,
I want all you folks to go down to the Champagne Room and have some lemonade, it's on me.
Nice work, Freddie, you can have your job back, too.
Thank you, Mr. Crandall, thank you.
Casey, something I gotta tell you.
What's that?
Never once did I believe you were the murderer.
I knew it all the time.
I was usin' you as a decoy.
- It's okay, kid.
- Okay, Casey.
See you downstairs.
Nice fella.
Freddie, I wanna congratulate you.
Without all those booby traps, we could have never solved this murder.
Thank you ever so much.
I'm gonna make a change now,
I wanna get out of these wet clothes.
Sure.
Yee.
This one, I completely forgot about.
For who shall defile the temples of the ancient gods, a cruel and violent death shall be his fate.
And never shall his soul find rest, unto eternity.
Such is the curse of Amon-Ra, king of all the gods!
I have answered your summons, All Highest.
It's good you have arrived, my son.
For I fear I shall not see the moon sink... beyond the Valley of theJackals again.
Time has come,
Father?
I am ready to go.
But first,
I must hand over to you... the secret guarded by the high priests of Karnak.
[Coughing]
Come,
I will show you.
Yes, Father.
Come closer.
[Father]
Look deep into the waters of Kar.
Behold.!
Over 3,000 years ago, the princess Ananka died.
She was buried with all the ceremony... due her exalted station.
Ananka's father,
King Amenophis, bid her a last farewell.
And thus... the Princess Ananka was placed in her tomb.
Kharis, a prince of the royal house... who loved Ananka, looked on in grief.
His devotion was so great... that he refused to believe that she was lost to him forever.
Kharis broke into the altar room of Isis... to steal the secret of eternal life from its hiding place.
With that he knew he could bring Ananka back to life.
Daring the anger of the ancient gods, he stole the forbidden tana leaves.
[Gong]
For the sin he had committed,
Kharis was condemned to be buried alive.
But first they cut out his tongue... so the ears of the gods would not be assailed... by his unholy curses.
The sinful Kharis was buried alone in a remote spot.
With him was also buried a great quantity of the forbidden tana leaves.
Then the slaves were killed... so they could not tell what had taken place.
Later the priests removed Kharis from his unholy grave... into a cave on the other side of this mountain.
Thus, none but the priests of Karnak know... where Kharis had been buried.
For over
3,000 years,
Kharis has remained there in his cave... on the other side of this mountain, and he waits to bring death... to whoever tries to defile Ananka's tomb.
For... Kharis never really died.
Kharis is still alive.
Beneath the idol of Isis you will find a copper box.
Open it.
Tana leaves!
Bring three of them.
Three of the leaves will make enough fluid... to keep Kharis's heart beating.
Once each night during the cycle of the full moon... you will dissolve three tana leaves, and give the fluid to Kharis.
[Howling]
You hear?
Children of the night.
They howl above the Hill of the Seven Jackals... when Kharis must be fed.
Should unbelievers seek... to desecrate the Tomb of Ananka, you will use nine leaves each night... to give life and movement to Kharis.
Thus you will enable him to bring vengeance... on the heads of those who try to enter.
Yes, master.
But never, for any reason, must you brew more than nine leaves at one time.
Should Kharis obtain a large amount of the fluid, he would become an uncontrollable monster, a soulless demon with the desire to kill... and kill.!
I understand, master.
I must hurry my message.
Remove your medallion of the lay priests of Karnak.
It's time for you to wear... the medallion of the high priests.
Now swear by the ancient gods of Egypt... that you will not betray your trust.
I swear by the mighty power of Amon-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world, and by the dread power of Set... that I will never betray my trust as high priest of Karnak.
O mighty gods of Egypt, you have chosen my successor.
May you find him worthy.
Hey, Steve!
What's all the excitement, Babe?
Hear from that blonde in Brooklyn?
She won't write me.
Won't or can't?
I told you Poopsie was a college girl.
Stacy's Beauty College.
That's what I said.
Everything's all fixed.
Fixed, what?
Jobs for us.
We work our way home as cargo loaders.
The MaryJ sails tonight.
Tonight?
The first mate's an old boss of mine.
I can see Brooklyn bridge right now.
Times Square.
I can smell those
Coney Island Hot Dogs.
And Poopsie.
Sure! Huh?
Forget it, Babe.
It was swell while it lasted.
You mean we ain't goin' home?
"Aren't."
It's been two months since you got fired by the Scripps Museum.
"Released" is the way they put it.
We've been all over
Egypt and we ain't dug up a soup bone!
Alms, alms for a poor unfortunate.
Alms.
Where did he get those collection plates?
We're gonna need one.
Shall I read your future in the sands of the Sahara?
Hey, don't you never take a shave?
[Clicking]
Oh, hello.
You like?
Yeah, it reminds me of somebody.
I can't remember who right now.
Real Egyptian doll.
Come from bazaar of Ayesha.
Bring good luck.
Effendi?
Where did this come from?
Arab find it, far away in the mountains.
Mm-hmm.
How much?
Very old piece, effendi.
Maybe.
I'll call her "Poopsie" after somebody I know.
[Saleslady]
She do real Egyptian dance.
Hey, Babe.!
Who, me?
No, he means me.
I'll be seeing you later.
How much money have we got?
38 cents, exactly.
I mean folding money.
Who, me?
It's in your shoe, $84.
What do you want it for?
I want to buy this vase.
That thing?
It's got a hole in it.
You're nuts.
Maybe, but I don't think so.
Take off that shoe.
Go on, take it off.
Oh!
$75, is that right?
Yes, effendi.
$75 for that.
I can get you a whole vase for two bits.
Not exactly like this.
84 bucks is all we've got left, and you spend $75 on a piece of junk like that.
We'll never get out of Egypt.
I know what I'm doing.
Is that right?
$75. It is as if
I am being robbed.
You're being robbed?
Come on.
Good luck?
Poopsie, you're just an 8-ball with hips!
This mark must mean a hill or a mountain.
And these markings translated give us another name.
The Hill of the Seven Jackals.
This square at the base must indicate Ananka's tomb.
If we're right and we find it...
Your place in archaeological history is assured, Banning.
As important a find as the tomb ofTutankhamen.
That sounds good, but where are you gonna find this Hill of the 7 Jackasses?
We'll go in and ask
Professor Andoheb.
Professor Andoheb?
Professor Andoheb?
Oh, come in, gentlemen.
Professor Andoheb, this is Mr. Banning.
How do you do?
And Mr. Jenson.
I've heard of
Mr. Banning.
I had no idea that my work had attracted... the attention of so great a scientist.
Yes, I believe I have the facts correct.
The Temple of the Sun in the Gobi Desert, the Inca ruins in Mexico, the lost Himalaya city.
Arresting achievements for so young a man.
Well, of late my luck hasn't been so good.
[Dr. Petrie]
But it's changed again.
Mr. Banning found this in a native bazaar.
This is quite unique.
It is very interesting.
You think so?
These hieroglyphics are amazingly clear.
We thought that...
Without doubt, it's one of the cleverest imitations I have ever seen.
Imitation?
Oh yes, that is quite apparent.
Surely you weren't taken in, Dr. Petrie?
As a matter of fact...
What makes you think this is not authentic?
Think,
Mr. Banning?
I have devoted my entire life to the study of
Egyptian relics.
And I have, if you'll pardon my saying so, achieved some standing as an authority.
I know your reputation, sir...
During the many years
I have been with the Cairo Museum... we have handled ten, possibly a dozen vases exactly like this.
The bazaars do a thriving business selling them to the tourists.
Do you mean to say that we chucked all that dough into the gutter?
That is a very colorful way of putting it,
Mr. Jenson.
I might as well have stayed in Brooklyn.
That gutter was paved with the good intentions... of many enthusiastic but mistaken young archaeologists.
Pardon me, professor, but I'm inclined to disagree with you.
Naturally you are entitled to your own opinion, Mr. Banning.
If the tomb of Ananka were really found in the Hill of the 7 Jackals, wouldn't it be worth the museum's while to finance an expedition?
No.
In the first place, this evidence is obviously manufactured.
Secondly, there have been two expeditions to that range of mountains.
They were very well-equipped.
They were never heard of again.
That is the most dangerous region in the whole of Egypt.
Well, thank you just the same professor, but I guess we'll have to seek financial assistance elsewhere.
[Crash]
I'm so sorry.
You must allow me to pay for my extraordinary clumsiness.
Well, I should hope to tell you!
That beautiful thing cost us $75... $150.
Don't bother, professor.
Come on, Babe.
Good day, gentlemen.
You still believe this is authentic, don't you?
I do.
And so do I.
I'm going to make a search for that...
We'll make a search for it.
If you'll include me.
I appreciate that.
I only wish I had the money to equip such an expedition.
I'll get the money someplace, Doctor.
Doc, if I had the dough
I'd certainly stake you to the limit.
[High Priest]
For who shall defile the temples of the ancient gods, a cruel and violent death shall be his fate.
Put it back in the deck, anywhere.
Don't let me see it.
Right? Cut 'em.
I'll give them a shuffle, all right. Jolly good one.
There, now let's see you do it.
King of spades?
Right, gentlemen?
Say, what's the idea?
You've been beating me all week.
Get yourself one of these to change your luck.
That's my Poopsie.
She's a blooming coochie dancer!
You didn't get the money?
Doesn't take a mind reader to tell that.
I've heard "no" in a lot of different Languages, but that tops them all.
His distorted sense of humor.
Swell, now we can go home.
We can't give up now.
All we need is a couple of measly thousand.
Couple of measly thousand?
Dollars or hieroglyphics?
What's that?
Petrie got us a permit.
Now we can dig anyplace in Egypt we want to.
Swell. All we need now is a couple of shovels.
Let's drink to Ananka.
How would you like to try your luck with two more drinks?
Not today, thanks.
Don't worry, there's one born every minute.
Uh-oh, look.
There is a Santa Claus.
Double brandy, my man.
Yes, sir.
Come on, Poopsie, we've got work to do.
Barnum was right.
How are you, stranger?
How would you like to see a nifty little card trick?
If I don't guess the card that you pick,
I buy you a drink.
But if I do, you buy me one.
Well, uh... all right.
As it's all in good fun,
Let's let everybody in on it, eh?
Everybody?
If you guess my card,
I buy drinks for everybody.
If not, you do.
Okay, that's all right with me.
Come over here, fellas.
We're gonna play a game and the loser buys the drinks.
Otgay uckersay.
You're telling me.
Stranger, pick yourself a card, any one you want.
Any one?
Any one you want.
Now put it back in the deck.
Don't let me see it.
Uh, mm-hmm.
Now shuffle 'em.
Go ahead, shuffle 'em up.
What this deck needs right now is a good shuffle.
Oh, Poopsie, don't fail me.
Sir, your card was, uh... your card was, uh... that's the first time that failed.
Um, it couldn't be the ace of spades?
No, it couldn't.
Um, well ah...
I give up.
What was your card?
Two of hearts.
There ain't no two of hearts in the deck.
Of course there is!
All right, then you show me.
It's right there.
All right, bartender, drinks for everybody.
The gentleman pays.
How are you gonna pay for all these drinks?
What are you worrying about money for?
You've got plenty.
Look at that there, money all over.
Here, you're not very observing.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Hard to light?
Try that one.
Oh.
So you're the great Solvani.
My name is Steve Banning, and this hopeless Houdini here is BabeJenson.
How are ya?
Americans
I take it?
You don't look like a Solvani yourself.
To be perfectly honest, I'm not.
A front, you know, show business.
Real name, Sullivan.
Tim Sullivan.
You couldn't be from Brooklyn?
Yes, Greenpoint.
I haven't been there in years.
Come on over and sit down.
That's a honey!
Your tricks are better than mine.
So you're the chief attraction of the Egyptian theater?
I was the chief attraction.
[Babe]
What's that "was"?
It seems the natives here don't appreciate the art of prestidigitation.
I'm on my way to reserve the best suite on the first boat to the good old U.S.A.
You mean, you still got some dough?
I'm not going to swim home, my boy.
You interest us.
There's no money to be made around these parts.
Um, shall we let him in on it?
No, Babe.
In on what?
Oh, well, I guess maybe you're right.
Aww, but we're both from Brooklyn.
We're practically brothers.
Yeah, practically.
Come on, can't we just tell him about it?
Go on.
You're wrong about Egypt.
We've stumbled on something that's gonna make us rich.
Here, in Egypt?
In a certain section of the mountains lies an undiscovered tomb... of an ancient Egyptian princess named Ananka.
I'm an archaeologist,
Mr. Solvani, and I've discovered proof of the existence of this tomb... and a clue to its possible location.
It'll only take a couple of thousand to outfit the expedition.
The possibilities are tremendous.
[Natives Speaking]
[Knocking]
Come in.
Miss Marta?
Yes?
I'm Marta Solvani.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Professor Andoheb of the Cairo museum.
How do you do?
I've had the pleasure... of watching you and your father.
May I say that he is a great artist, and you are most charming?
Thank you very much.
Do you mind if I go on with my packing?
I'm in rather a hurry.
You are leaving?
Tonight.
I'm so glad.
We shall be most sorry to lose so charming an artist, but in a way it is better that you should go!
I don't understand you, professor.
Miss Marta, for some time the government of Egypt... has been trying to protect strangers from swindlers, who obtain money to finance supposed expeditions... to rob the tombs of our ancient dead.
In the past, these field trips have met with disaster.
The backers have either been slain or left to starve, while the swindlers have returned to Cairo with their stolen money.
What has that got to do with me?
I have reason to believe that your father... might have been approached with such a proposal.
You mean that someone's trying to swindle him... into financing a fake expedition?
Precisely.
But that's preposterous!
In an hour we'll be on the boat sailing for home.
My father's out buying the tickets now.
I am so happy to hear that.
Don't take offense that it is I, a stranger, who warned you.
Not at all.
I'm extremely grateful.
It is most regrettable that so lovely a person must leave our country.
However, may I wish you a most pleasant journey... back to your homeland?
Alms for a poor unfortunate.
Cigarettes.
[Native Language]
There, that makes us all partners.
Gosh, this was a fortunate meeting.
I just can't wait to get started.
Oh, boy, that calls for a drink.
It's empty.
Hey, waiter!
No, no, don't bother the waiter.
Here.
Gotta have a... but what's comin'...
Another one.
Listen...
I guess that's all I can spare!
Oh, boy!
You're terrific!
Wait'll we get on the expedition.
Won't we have fun!
[Babe]
You're positively a genius.!
To the Princess Ananka and her jewels.
Hey, what goes on here?
Help! Police!
[Screaming]
Stop it!
Stop it!
Get him outta here!
I'll take care of these guys!
Come on, junior!
Thanks, Brooklyn!
Come on, Steve!
Stop!
Stop, I say!
Help! Police!
Help! Help!
[Whistling]
So you finally got back?
I've been to get the tickets.
It didn't take all day, did it?
You left me here to do the packing.
A swell job you made of it.
You don't have to unpack, either.
Either?
What are you talking about?
Why, ah...
Did I ever show you this one?
Yes, you did!
Hey, be careful.
What do you mean by "either"?
Marta, I've got great news for you.
Stupendous news!
Colossal surprise!
Oh, my goodness.
Wait'll I tell you.
No, you wait till I tell you.
You've stumbled upon a terrific piece of luck.
Yeah.
It just came right up and bumped you.
Yeah.
You're going to be very rich.
You're going to find a tomb filled with gold and diamonds.
Yeah... how did you know?
You're going to finance an expedition.
Egad!
That fake mind-reading I've been teaching you isn't fake!
Pop, you didn't give
'em the money yet?
Oh...
Oh, how could you?
These men are swindlers!
I've been warned!
They can't be.
I've got a contract.
I've got a...
I know I've got a contract...
Oh.
It's somewhere.
There it is.
Oh, no, that's not it.
Ah, there it is.
When will you grow up?
First it was a dry oil well, then a skin lotion to make everybody beautiful.
Well, it did turn out to be good for moths.
"Received ofTim Sullivan,
$2,000 to finance a search for the tomb of Ananka.
"Tim Sullivan will share as a third partner in the venture.
Signed, Steve Banning."
Everything's quite okay.
You've given those crooks every cent we had in the world.
No, darling, no.
They're not crooks, not those fellas.
Where do they live?
Where do they live?
Oh... where do they live?
Where do they live?
Uh... through the window into the... I don't know.
You gave them all this money and you don't even know where they live?
That's just fine!
"Cairo Hotel."
I'll fix them with my trick revolver.
Hey! What are you going to do with that?
If you don't know how to deal with these crooks, I do!
Marta, Marta!
Mart...
Get me out ofhere.!
I can't get out.!
You've got the key.!
You stay in there and keep out of trouble!
Get me out ofhere.!
Marta.!
Poopsie, we're in the money!
[Knocking]
Are you Steve Banning?
Well, uh, maybe.
Dispense with the fooling around.
Hand over that money!
Money?
Hey, now wait a minute.
Little girls that play with guns is liable to get hurt!
I'll get hurt?
[Gunshots]
How about that money?
You do all right with that cannon.
I've been making my living with it since I was seven.
[Talking]
It must be the hotel people.
They heard the fireworks.
You just give me back the money you stole from my father!
Your father?
Solvani.
Don't play innocent.
The guy you want to shoot is Steve Banning.
He's right behind you!
Stop clowning.
I've seen that show.
I'm keeping you covered until I get that money!
All right...
Listen, young lady.
You seem to be laboring under the delusion that we stole that money from your father.
Of course, you did.
I'm no child nor credulous old man.
We're not crooks.
We sincerely believe in what we're trying to do.
Then prove it by returning that money.
I can't.
It's spent.
Native diggers, supplies, equipment.
I know your kind.
You pretend to go on an expedition so you can get my father in the desert... to kill him or leave him to starve.
That was the last cent we had.
I'm sorry, I thought your father was a wealthy man.
Otherwise we'd never have taken that money.
We didn't even know he had a daughter.
You know it now.
I'm going to see that he's not defrauded.
Defrauded?
Miss Solvani, Dr. Petrie, an eminent archaeologist, will vouch for us.
We intend to find that tomb and share the proceeds with your father.
Well, just the same, you're not going to trap me into going on anything like that!
Who said you were going?
Well, I did.
You don't think I'm going to let you get my father out there alone!
And you'd better not try to get away without us.
We'll be right with you, every minute!
[Whistling]
Can a woman go nuts from gettin' sawed in half too many times?
She's pretty, isn't she?
Yeah. Huh?
Oh, now we're stuck with a dame.
Any progress, Doctor?
Find anything at all?
In archaeology, one must have infinite patience.
Sure, but you're finding something, aren't you?
A few coins, beads.
Enough to tell us we're on the right track.
We travel miles through the desert just to find a few beads and coins.
I hope you're satisfied.
It's a start, Marta.
Things could be worse.
They are. Come on and try your disappearing act on a donkey.
Huh?
He's in our tent studying your tricks.
Come on, Pop.
'Morning. Nice day.
If you like
Turkish baths.
Here's the detonator.
Ready for your blast?
Almost.
What does anyone want to get buried away out here for?
This was probably once the heart of a great metropolis.
Metropolis?
What's that?
One of those prehistoric animals?
Look, effendi.!
Look.!
Dr. Gustafson and his wife.
Their expedition disappeared two years ago.
What a horrible fate.
They were probably trapped in a landslide.
Take some men and give him a decent burial.
[Native Language]
[Shouting]
They're afraid.
They will not touch it.
All right, we'll do it ourselves.
[Explosion]
Babe, where are you?
Wow!
You all right?
I started to hook the wire to the detonator to set off the dynamite, and here I am.
Effendi!
Effendi!
This is an unholy tomb.
It's the seal of the Seven Jackals!
There's a curse, death to whoever breaks that seal!
Oh, bosh!
We can't stop now for a lot of silly native superstitions.
I have waited a long time for this moment.
Hey, what's eating those guys?
They fear the wrath of the gods.
We need them.
Babe, get a couple of lanterns.
Yeah.
It's open.
Give me a hand.
Easy.
It's heavy.
Watch out.
Whoa!
It isn't sealed.
Let's take it off.
Careful, now.
Careful.
That isn't Princess Ananka.
It's a man!
And in the finest state of preservation of any mummy I've ever seen.
Is this all there is?
Where's the treasure?
The gold and jewels?
[Howling]
[Howling]
I don't understand.
We search for the tomb of a princess, and we find the mummy of a man.
And in a cheap casket, at that.
We found something.
That proves we're on the right track.
Maybe this fella's sort of a poor relation of Ananka's.
I think you're being kind of unfair, Marta.
Steve believes in what he's trying to do.
Finding this tomb means more to him than anything in the world.
[Howling]
What's that?
Oh, a jackass.
You wouldn't mean a jackal, would you?
What's the difference?
They're first cousins.
I never heard that before.
We ain't never had no full moon before.
[Babe]
They say a moon like that does things to you.
You take me, for instance.
Give me a moon and...
You can have it.
Pop, let's turn in.
That thing gives me the creeps.
Good night, Babe.
Good night.
[Howling]
Aww, quiet!
If it ain't you, it's the camels.
If it ain't the camels, it's the mummy.
If it isn't the mummy, it's you.
From the hieroglyphics, his name seems to have been Kharis.
Doctor, what do these lines in his face mean?
There's only one answer.
He was buried alive.
He must have struggled desperately against those bandages.
What a terrible way to die, probably for some sacrilege.
Possibly.
Have you touched his face?
What?
Go ahead, touch it.
It feels like living tissue.
Exactly.
The most amazing example of embalming I've ever seen.
Incredible.
Isn't it?
Come here.
Have you any idea what they are?
I may be wrong, but they must be tana leaves.
Absolutely extinct now.
Smells like clover.
The old Egyptians used them for embalming purposes, I think.
Doctor, there's one thing that bothers me.
We haven't found Ananka's name anyplace in here.
Do you think that after all, we might've made a mistake?
I hope not.
But these disappointments are all in the game, Steve.
Yes, I suppose so.
[Babe]
Steve.!
Be right back.
Ali's back.
Where are the diggers?
They will not come, effendi.
They have run away from the valley.
What's the matter?
[Howling]
There is death in the hills.
Those are evil spirits.
They came to howl about the unholy grave you have opened!
That's nonsense,
Ali.!
I cannot stay.
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute.
Very interesting, aren't they, Dr. Petrie.
Professor Andoheb!
Where did you come from?
The important thing,
Doctor, is that I'm here.
Then you knew about this tomb?
And yet you insisted that the vase was an imitation.
There are some things in science which should be brought to light.
There are others, Doctor, which should be left alone.
You mean, we never should have never come into this cave?
Since you are here, I think it is fitting that you... should learn exactly what you've stumbled upon.
Come.
For a scientist, you are very unobserving, Dr. Petrie.
Why, it's a pulse beat.
Why, this is absurd.
It's... it's fantastic.
In this vial, I have the fluid from nine tana leaves.
Nine tana leaves,
Dr. Petrie.
That wouldn't mean anything to you, but watch.
Now, Dr. Petrie.
Why, it's beating faster.
He's alive.
Let me go!
Let me go.!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go.!
The destiny of the priests of Karnak is fulfilled.
Not one of you who tried to enter the tomb of Ananka... will leave this valley alive.
The mummy, somebody's swiped it.
Who could have done that?
I can't understand it.
Steve, Petrie!
What could have happened?
I don't know, Babe.
He's dead.
Maybe the natives.
You will place this vial of tana fluid... in the tent of one of the unbelievers.
I understand, master.
Then go.
Now, look, this is an easy one.
That's what you always say.
You put it in the palm of the hand like so.
The rock there?
Yeah.
Put it in your mouth.
Open your mouth.
It's gone.
There.
Oh, boy, that's a... wow.
Let me try it.
Put it in my hand like that, huh?
Yeah.
Then close my hand, see?
Now, watch. Across my mouth like this?
Oh, that's wonderful, effendi.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
[Andoheb]
You will do exactly as I say,
Kharis. I am your master.
Only I can tell you where you will find the fluid that gives you life.
You would like to have use of that leg and that arm.
To do so, you need more of the fluid.
In the tent of a white man you will find it.
To get it, you will kill.
Kill wherever you find the fluid.
Steve?
This right?
Just about.
The first two letters of
Ananka's name were here, weren't they?
[Steve]
Mm-hmm.
Don't you think that if her tomb were located near the mummy's cave, that her name would have been closer to it?
Possibly.
I've been doing a little figuring.
Now we found out that this square indicates the mummy's cave, but her name is way over here.
Could that mean anything?
Well, it might mean that her tomb were somewhere behind the cave.
Exactly.
There must be some sort of connection between the two.
Marta, I believe you're right.
I think you've hit it.
Oh, I hope so.
I owe this party a little contribution of some kind.
We'll start digging for a connecting pass right away.
Hey, Babe!
Hey, Babe!
Solvani! Ali!
What's up?
I think Marta has the solution to the whole thing.
There must be a passageway connecting this cave with Ananka's tomb.
Oh, that's swell.
Let's get going.
Where's Ali?
Outside.
We'll start on that wall over there.
You really expect to find the entrance to Ananka's tomb over there?
Well, we didn't expect to find the entrance to the Bronx subway, old boy.
[Howling]
Solid rock back here.
No sign of a tunnel.
Hey, we better knock off or the archaeologist's union will start picketing us.
Maybe you're right.
It is pretty late.
We'll get a fresh start in the morning.
Steve.
Yes, Marta?
Wasn't this urn filled with leaves?
Why, yes.
Well, there's none in there now.
What could have happened to them?
I don't know.
Marta, there are a lot of strange things happening around here... that need a lot of explaining.
But there's nothing we can do about it tonight.
[Distant Howling]
Say, where's Ali?
I told him to watch the camp.
Probably gettin' some shut-eye.
You can't trust these gypsies.
This mountain air makes them sleepy.
You folks better get some rest. We got a busy day tomorrow.
It's a good idea.
Good night, Steve.
Good night, Babe.
Good night.
Hey, it won't hurt you to get a little sleep too, partner.
Babe, I think we're on the right track.
Tomorrow, we'll divide up the cave into sections... and each works...
[Marta Screaming]
What's the matter?
It's Ali.
He's been killed.
Look, those gray streaks on his throat.
Yeah, just like on Petrie's.
Poor Ali.
That means that petrie was killed the same way.
Hey, there's somebody around here that just don't like company.
Ah, ohh-ohh!
Steve, l...
Marta, you're not the only one that's jittery around here.
We're all getting out first thing in the morning.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Steve.
I realize how much this expedition meant to you.
Well, this doesn't mean that I'm quitting.
I'll get some help and I'll come back.
As soon as I know that you and your father are safe.
I think it's better if you two sleep in my tent tonight.
Babe and I will stand watch until it's light enough to get an early start.
Whatever you say, Steve.
We can stay up with you.
Well, somebody oughta get some shut-eye around here.
I'll get your things.
Don't let anything happen to him, will you, Babe?
Kind of like to have him around, don't you?
Me too.
Marta, you're all set.
Good night, Babe.
Good night, Marta.
You go on and get some sleep, Marta.
We'll get a start as soon as it's light.
Steve.
Yes?
I wish you'd give all this up and come back to the states with us.
Well, I can't promise you that, but I will be back sometime.
You mind if I say I think you're a swell person?
Hmm?
[Choking]
Babe! Babe, what's the matter?
What happened?
I was practicing my rock trick.
Well, the next time, you better practice on a pebble.
Oh.
[Distant Howling]
[Marta]
Pop.
What?
Pop, I'm afraid.
There's something about that cave that no one of us understands.
There's something going on that we're just powerless to stop.
Nonsense, honey.
You're just all unstrung.
In a month, we'll be back home... standing 'em in the aisles again.
Okay, Pop.
Good night.
Good night.
[Distant Howling]
Babe, those jackals give me goose pimples.
Ah, they give me goose pimples on top of my goose pimples.
[Choking]
[Marta Screaming]
Marta!
Marta.
Don't you worry,
Mr. Solvani.
We'll find her.
Babe!
Marta! Marta!
Hey, look!
This urn is busted. They must have come through here.
How could they have disappeared?
How does anything happen around here?
I'm gonna take a look outside.
Oh, you're not leaving me here alone.
- Look out, Babe!
- [Gunshot]
It's the beggar from the bazaar.
What would he be doing here?
I don't know. Look.
[Steve]
Why, it's the same drawing that was on that vase, complete.
Look. There's the cave of Kharis clearly marked.
And on the other side of the hill, it looks like a temple.
Right by the temple is the whole of Ananka's name.
Yeah, but those lines between her tomb and the cave.
That must be the passageway we've been looking for.
That's how they disappeared.
You take a shot at trying to find the temple on the other side of the hill... and I'll see if I can't locate the entrance to that passageway.
One of us is bound to get through.
Okay, boss, if I don't get back before dawn, forget it.
Poopsie, up to now, you've been a complete washout.
Now let me see you do your stuff.
You will return at once to the tombs of our ancient dead.
There you will find more of the fluid.
Go while the moon is yet high in the heavens.
Your power to move wanes with the moon.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You're quite safe.
That awful creature!
You're very beautiful.
So beautiful, I'm going to make you immortal.
Like Kharis, you will live forever.
What I can do for you,
I can also do for myself.
Neither time nor death can touch us.
You and I, together for eternity.
Here in the temple of Karnak, you shall be my high priestess.
"And thus...
"will Kharis be kept alive...
"by the tana leaves...
"during the cycle of... the full moon."
I'm going to prepare enough fluid from these tana leaves... to make us both immortal.
No! No!
You will be grateful for this gift.
Mummy case.
You're mad.
Steve Banning will find you and kill you.
If by some chance, he should escape Kharis and kill me, your peril will be great indeed.
What do you mean?
If Kharis should obtain the rest of the tana fluid, he would become a monster such as the world has never known.
Ah, what's the matter with me?
I must be getting nervous.
Come on, Poopsie.
I don't think I would shoot if I were you, Mr. Jenson.
Well, if it ain't our old friend Professor Andoheb.
At your service.
What are you doing out here in the mountains, selling real estate?
Not exactly...
Where's the girl?
Where you'll never see her again.
No, she's not dead.
See here, you Egyptian Mickey Finn,
I'll give you 'til three to tell me where she is.
I'm not kidding. One...
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man in cold blood.
Two.
If you were to kill me, you would leave at large a monster... whom only
I can control.
Three.
Mighty Isis, forgive me.
[Marta] Steve.!
Marta, what happened?
How did you get here?
The mummy brought me here. He's alive.
Yes, I know.
Pop. Is he all right?
He's all right.
Just a little shaken up.
We've got to get you out of here in a hurry.
He's after tana fluid.
That's what must be in this vial.
And in the urn, Steve.
It's full of the fluid.
You mustn't let him get it.
Keep him away from it.
[Marta]
Stop him.!
[Marta]
Stop him.!
Oh, how horrible.
Boy, was I glad to see you.
Steve.
Ah, that's just like a woman.
When the shooting's all over and everything's Jake, they pass out.
Marta! Marta!
Where did this come from?
Arab find it far away in mountains.
No more broken vases, dear.
We're going back to America, remember?
Anything you say, boss.
Hey, Steve.
Steve, I got a cablegram for you.
Everything get on the ship all right?
Yep. The jewels of Ananka are safe in the ship's vault.
Hey, what's cooking, partner?
Read it.
The job in the bone-washing department is no longer open.
Stop. I'm taking it myself.
Stop. You're getting my job.
Best regards,
Doc Lyons.

AUDIENCE: Bing Crosby.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Are you sure?
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
Well, all right. That's right, Bing Crosby is a crooner who has four boys...
...and he's not making a picture called
My Son, My Son, My Son, My Son.
I'm sorry you missed that, Mr. Corey.
Miss Gabby Lawson, for your last question.
Mr. Ray Wolfe of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, wants you to name this song.
[BAND PLAYING
"POP GOES THE WEASEL"]
- "Pop Goes the Weasel."
- What?
- "Pop Goes the Weasel."
- You popped it right on the head.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, what's the difference between a weasel, an easel and a measle?
What's a measle?
Go ahead, break out with it.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
Uh, a measle is one of the measles, I guess.
Ha, ha, that's all right.
Now, if there is such a word as "measle"...
...it's the singular of "measles," is that right? Or am I too rash?
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
Now, what's an easel?
- Well, an easel is a...
- Yeah, yeah.
Oh, no, don't use your hands.
Describe it in words for our radio audience.
Well, an easel is a sort of stand for artists to put their paintings.
Right, right. That's good enough.
An easel is a frame to support a painter's canvas...
...or on which to place an object of art or a painting.
That's what you said, isn't it?
Ha, ha, yeah.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
Now, what is a weasel?
This one's very "easel."
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
A weasel is a little man.
A little man?
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
Are you sure?
That's what I've heard my mother call my father.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
Oh, now. Could be, could be.
As a slang expression, you're absolutely right.
Although a weasel is really a small four-legged animal.
But that's very good, Miss Lawson.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, Mr. Corey, here's your last question.
Mr. Frank Martinelli of San Francisco...
...wants you to name this song and tell us from what picture it was taken.
[BAND PLAYING "HEIGH-HO"]
"Heigh-Ho, Heigh-Ho."
- Correct. "As off to work we go."
- That's right.
Is that song from Gulliver's Travels...
...Snow White, Pinocchio or Gone With the Wind?
- It's from Pinocchio.
- No, take another guess.
Don't let this get you "Disney."
Go ahead, take another guess.
[BELL RINGS]
- Students.
ALL: Snow White.
Right. "Heigh-Ho" was the marching song...
...of Snow White's friends, the Seven Dwarfs.
Now, can you name three of the Seven Dwarfs?
[SNEEZES]
Cut it out.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
- Sneezy.
- Sneezy. I wonder how he got that?
Now, two more, ha, ha.
Oh, boy, boy.
- Happy.
- Happy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're doing fine.
Sneezy and Happy and one more...
- Oh, Dopey.
- What are you looking at me for?
[ALL LAUGHING]
- Just for that you have to sing.
AUDIENCE: Oh.
The song is
"My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean."
And in case you're nervous...
By the way, here are the words to the song.
In case you're nervous, we're gonna give you a bite of this cake every now and then.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
Just to help you along.
All right, let's go, and don't stop singing.
Take it away, Lyman.

Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me

- Enjoying the program, honey?
- I certainly am.
I can't understand how they make it come out on time.
Good management. Where do you suppose
Kay would be if it weren't for me?
- Right out there where he is now.

What a session. What a session.
And now, no more cogitation, it's time for relaxation.
So off with your thinking caps, on with your shoes with taps.

[SINGING] Like the fella once said
While shaving his mush
I'm telling you, baby
You're getting the brush
Know what the bug said to the windshield?
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
"That's me all over."
Yeah. "That's me all o..."
[BAND LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]
[BAND PLAYING "THINKING OF YOU"]
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
They'll be off the air in two minutes.
- Let's wait in Kay's dressing room.
- All right.
[KAY IMITATING AUCTIONEER]
Well, nothing old-fashioned about radio, is there?
Nothing except the comedian's jokes.
You know tonight's the first time
I've seen you in six months?
- Let me take a look at you.
- Let me take a look at myself first.
Something tells me your face is gonna be an awful shock to Kay's mirror.
Ha, ha, my lips just won't stay on.
- They stay on me just fine.
- Oh...
You can't improve on that face and you know it.
Sometimes I think I ought to break down and ask you to marry me.
- Why don't you?
- You're not rich enough.
Oh, but my Aunt Margo is.
Incidentally, I wrote her all about you.
You know, auntie is a lady who is very hard to please.
Say, what...?
What "what"?
Oh, uh, what did your Aunt Margo say?
Well, she said she'd be very glad to have me back home...
...after so many years at school.
She's glad I invited friends for the night I arrive...
...because it's the eve of my 21 st birthday, and I should have a party anyway.
She'll be very happy to meet my young man...
...and hopes Mr. Kyser won't charge her much for playing at my party.
"Love and kisses, Aunt Margo."
- Chatty old babe, isn't she?
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Kay.
- Say, Chuck...
...there's a few things
I want you to do for me...
Whoa, hold the striptease.
This lady comes from nice people.
- Whoa, oh, excuse me.
CHUCK: Ha, ha.
- Kay, I want you to meet Janis Bellacrest.
- Hello, Mr. Kyser.
KAY:
The name is Kay. How do you do?
I don't usually undress in front of strange ladies.
- I'm sure you don't.
- Come to, Kay.
Janis is the girl you're gonna play for tomorrow night.
- Oh, of course, that's the birthday party.
CHUCK: Yes.
- Then you're the girl that Chuck, uh...
- That's right.
The girl Chuck met when you were playing Boston.
Say, you told me she was just a schoolgirl.
- She was when I met her, finishing school.
- Oh, but now I'm finished.
I know you have a lot of things to do, so I'll run along.
- Did you tell Mac we'll be using the bus?
- It's all taken care of.
- I'm looking forward to tomorrow evening.
- Thanks.
- So long, boss.
- So long.
You're not going back to Bellacrest Manor tonight, are you?
- Mm-mm, I have to finish my shopping.
- That's all I wanted to know.
How about a short rumba a long Cuba libre?
- Oh, I can't argue against that.
- Swell. I'll get a cab.
MAN:
Go.
[CROWD MURMURING]
CHUCK:
Let her through.
Taxi!
Drive down Broadway.
I'd like to get my hands on the drunk who was driving that car.
He couldn't have come much closer if he was trying to hit you.
He was, Chuck.
- What?
- I don't believe that man was drunk.
- I think he aimed at me deliberately.
- Well, how do you figure that?
Chuck, that's the third near accident
I've had in two weeks.
I didn't mention it because I can't be sure of it...
...but I think somebody's trying to get me out of the way.
So that's why you're packing that artillery in your bag.
I saw it in the mirror.
Oh, but it doesn't make sense, honey.
Who would wanna flatten out those curves of yours?
I haven't the slightest idea who or why.
- You know what I think?
- Mm-mm.
I think that you've been the victim of a series of unpleasant coincidences.
You get back home tomorrow, and never give it another thought.
Maybe you're right.
- I'm probably dramatizing the whole thing.
- Certainly.
Just the same,
I'm glad you're coming to the house.
I'll feel a lot better with you and Kay and the gang around.
Sure you will.
We ought to be pretty near.
Two or three minutes maybe.
This'll be a pleasure.
I enjoy playing for the 400.
You made the Society page today, Kay.
Listen.
"The guests at Janis Bellacrest's
21 st birthday party tonight...
...will dance to the music of Kay Kyser and his band.
Miss Bellacrest returns home today after an absence of three years at school.
Some may remember that the luxurious Bellacrest Manor...
...was built by the late Elmer Bellacrest, noted financial magnate and explorer."
He must have been slightly peculiar too.
I read once that the old boy used to sit by the hour and play the piccolo.
Well, all musicians are a little crazy.
That's a lie!
[MEN CHUCKLE]
[BARKS]
Ish, must you bring that fugitive from the dog pound every place we go?
Well, I couldn't leave Prince at home,
Kay.
He's terribly sensitive.
[MEN CHUCKLE]
That looks like it.
What a beautiful spot for a murder.
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
That's the bridge they told me about.
It's the only way of getting in and out of the joint.
Kay, you and Ginny go on ahead.
Mac, drive around to the other entrance.
- Hello there. Don't get blown away.
KAY: Hello.
- How's my favorite singer?
GINNY: Never better.
- Go right on in.
- Are we on time?
You nearly beat me.
I've only been here an hour myself.
- Jurgen, see that the boys are taken care of.
- Yes, Miss.
JANIS:
When it blows here, it really blows.
Yes, this ought to be a great place to fly a kite.
Make yourselves at home.
Come on, I'll show you the powder room.
GINNY:
I must look windblown.
KAY:
Well, this is something.
We never played a party in a museum before.
The old boy certainly collected a lot of souvenirs.
Yeah, I'll bet he had a towel from every hotel in the world.
Well, here's a cozy little nook.
Yeah, this is probably where Elmer practiced exploring, ha, ha.
I'd better give the boys St. Bernard dogs in case they lose each other.
Hey, get a load of this, Kay.
- Looks like a dart game.
- Yeah.
"Blowgun, Malay Peninsula. The puncture made by the dart is almost invisible...
...and the poison cannot be traced in the body.
The victim appears to have died from natural causes."
- Cute, huh?
- Listen, Chuck...
...don't ever book us on the Malay Peninsula.
Chuck, how do you like the place?
Don't tell me.
You just saved me from telling a horrible lie.
You haven't seen anything yet.
The house is full of these gadgets.
Yes, very homey.
JANIS: I'd like to get rid of them, but Aunt Margo won't hear of it.
I think they make the place look creepy.
Don't you, Kay?
Well, I don't know. L... l...
JANIS: Oh, there you are, darling.
Come and meet my friends.
I want you to know my aunt,
Miss Margo Bellacrest.
Uh, this is Chuck Deems, the young man I told you about.
- How do you do?
- Happy to know you...
- And this is Mr. Kay Kyser.
- Kay Kyser.
Yes.
- Yes, I know.
- Good evening, ma'am.
Of course, Aunt Margo, you've heard Kay's music on the radio.
I've heard Mr. Kyser's music, but not on the radio.
It comes to me from another source.
Won't you come into the study,
Mr. Kyser?
You must rest a moment after your long trip.
JANIS: I'll show you where the boys are going to play.
- All right.
- Won't you need me, Chuck?
Oh, don't bother, Kay,
I'll arrange the usual setup.
Come with me.
[BAND MURMURING]
You thinking of buying that, Ish?
No, I wouldn't give you a nickel for that bird.
That's the worst job of mounting
I've ever seen.
- How do you know?
- My uncle was an animal stuffer.
- He was?
- Why, sure.
That's terrible. Look there.
The tail ain't on right, and he's got the eyes in the wrong sockets.
Boy, whoever stuffed that bird sure was an amateur.
[CAWING]
I'm so glad you came, Mr. Kyser.
You've made me very happy.
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
You know, you and I are kindred souls.
We are? Why?
Because...
...you ask questions on the radio.
I ask questions too, but you ask them of the living, while I...
I ask them of the dead.
Of the...? Of the dead?
I have pierced the veil.
I speak to those who have gone to the other side.
Oh, yes, the other side.
Come with me a moment.
There he is, sweet soul.
You never knew my dear, departed brother, Elmer...
...did you, Mr. Kyser?
- No, I don't think I ever had the pleasure.
You will meet him here, and you'll be his friend.
He, too, loved music.
And when he speaks to me now...
...it's sometimes through the voice of the instrument he loved.
The? The piccolo?
Yes, the piccolo.
Showing Mr. Kyser the family album,
Aunt Margo?
Mr. Kyser and I have a great deal in common, Janis.
Uh, she means the questions.
You see, we both ask questions.
Oh, auntie, I hope you haven't been boring Kay with those wild ideas.
Is communicating with the spirit of your father a wild idea?
Please, darling.
Aunt Margo has been letting her imagination run away with her.
You will believe when you see for yourself.
They come to me in the darkness.
The strange, Ionely voices of those who have gone beyond.
Elmer's voice comes too.
And sometimes his face.
And then there are other faces.
Faces of those who have long since gone beyond the veil.
Mr. Kyser knows what I mean.
Don't you, Mr. Kyser?
Oh, hello there.
I thought you were taking a nap.
Well, I was, my dear. Thank you.
I'm so sorry if I startled your friend...
...but I didn't want to interrupt your Aunt Margo.
Oh, I'm quite sure you're welcome.
I'd like you to meet one of my dearest friends.
Judge Mainwaring, Mr. Kyser.
- How do you do?
- Good evening, Spencer.
- I must say you're looking very well, Margo.
- Thank you.
[GINNY LAUGHS]
JANIS:
Ginny, I'll be right with you.
Come with us, Kay,
I'll show you to your rooms.
- Coming, Aunt Margo?
- Yes, dear.
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
Uh, please don't think me rude...
...but do you mind if I ask a personal question?
Not at all.
The old lady, Miss Bellacrest, is she wacky?
Wacky?
I mean, is she inclined to be?
As her attorney for several years,
Mr. Kyser...
...I can assure you that Margo Bellacrest is just as sane as I am.
Oh, I see. Well, thanks just the same.
Pardon me.
Well, so long, I'll see you later.
Gentlemen, your room is down the hall.
- I'm glad of that.
- Oh, so am I.
[BUTLER CLEARS THRO AT]
- Mr. Kyser, this is your room, sir.
- Thank you.
Who decorated this room, Robert Ripley?
This was the master's room, sir.
He was quite a collector.
KAY: Yes, the master would have been a perfect guest for Hobby Lobby.
His hobby caused his death, sir.
- His hobby caused his death?
- Yes, sir.
Some African savages accused
Mr. Bellacrest of looting their temple.
- But he was only collecting, of course?
- Of course.
But the natives misunderstood.
Judge Mainwaring said they literally cut the master into ribbons, sir.
- Judge Mainwaring?
- Yes, sir.
He was with the master when it happened.
The judge barely escaped with his life.
Can I do anything else, sir?
No, no, no. You've made me very happy.
I hope you'll be comfortable, sir.
Comfortable.
Hi, boy.
[WHISTLING]
I beg your pardon.
I trust I haven't disturbed you.
Not at all, not at all. Come right in.
- Oh, you are in, aren't you?
- Yes.
I just came to tell you that the spirit of Elmer Bellacrest is in this room.
I'm sure you'll find it a friendly one.
Oh, yes, we'll get along just fine together.
Oh, forgive me. I am Prince Saliano.
How do you do?
Miss Margo Bellacrest has told me that you are a believer.
- I am? I mean, she has?
- Yes, and it is well.
In this house, it is dangerous for those who ridicule.
Spirits are strongly displeased with the skeptical.
I can understand exactly how they feel.
I shall go now.
Forgive me again for this intrusion.
Uh, drop in again sometime.
Yes.
Yes, I shall.
Well, I hope Kay doesn't get the wrong impression.
I didn't know until today auntie had gone psychic...
...or I wouldn't have brought you up here.
- Kay is broadminded.
I never knew there were houses like this except in mystery books.
That's where they belong, in mystery books.
[CHUCKLES]
Of course, Jurgen doesn't look his part.
In the stories I've read, the butler is always cruel and wicked-Iooking.
And I'm afraid Judge Mainwaring has much too nice a voice to frighten anyone.
Of course he has.
Judge Mainwaring was Daddy's oldest friend.
And Jurgen's been with us for years.
So even if the house does seem haunted,
I'm sure that...
[GASPS]
What is it? Janis, what's wrong?
There was a face...
...at that window.
A face?
Not a soul out there.
It must be your imagination.
Oh, of all the stupid things.
What a shame, Ginny.
That's entirely my fault.
Oh, quel dommage.
Wouldn't it be just like me to do a thing like this?
You take that right off and wear one of mine.
I hope it fits.
I've never sung in my underwear before.
Here's one that made the boys at the senior prom absolutely swoon.
Mm, I'm glad I tore mine now.
- Lily will fix this, mademoiselle.
- I'm sure it'll fit, just slip into it.
Ginny, it's perfect. It couldn't be better if you were poured into it.
If I ruin this one, I'll die.
Oh, I knew I felt naked.
I forgot my bracelet.
[GINNY HUMMING]
[JANIS SCREAMS]
- Hey, Kay.
- Come on, Harry.
GINNY:
Kay, something's wrong.
- What happened? Are you all right?
- The light's went out in my room.
MAN:
Did somebody get hurt?
[ALL MURMURING]
ISH: There they are.
- For heaven's sake, what happened?
I went back to get my bracelet and all the lights went out.
- Well, who screamed?
JANIS: I'm afraid I did.
- Is something wrong, dear?
- Oh, yes, there is, judge.
[ALL MURMURING]
Just a minute, boys.
Please, one at a time.
The lights went out all over the house.
- Is that what caused the excitement?
- Well, yes, I screamed. It's terribly silly.
JUDGE: I'm afraid our lighting system isn't very dependable during a storm like this.
CHUCK: Then let's just blame the weather and forget about it, ha, ha.
JANIS:
See what happens when I throw a party?
- Never a dull moment.
ALL: Ha, ha.
- Let's go, Ginny.
- All right.
- See you downstairs, Kay.
- We'll be right with you.
Uh, Chuck.
There's nothing to be upset about.
You know what lightning will do to these power plants.
What's the idea?
Listen, Chuck, I just saw something that gave me the creeps.
- What?
- Take a look at this.
Why, when I saw this thing sticking in the wa...
Why, it's gone.
- What's gone?
- One of those blowgun needles...
...that kills you without leaving any trace.
It was sticking right here.
- Oh, it was?
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- Kay, I think you're going a little screwy.
- Oh, you do, huh?
Well, I'm not screwy enough to stay in this place.
Now, wait a minute, Kay.
Take it easy. You can't do this to me.
Oh, can't I?
You can't ruin a girl's party because you've got a case of nerves.
Nerves, my baton.
Nobody's gonna keep me around a house...
...where some screwball is throwing poison darts.
Why, if his aim had been better...
...Ginny would have been wearing that in the back of her neck.
But I didn't see any dart.
When you looked, it was gone.
And the next time you look, I'll be gone.
Why do you get me into these things?
All right, Kay, wait a minute.
Maybe somebody did throw a poison dart...
...but if what you say is true,
Janis is in danger.
We've gotta stay here and protect her.
I'm in love with her, Kay.
- You are, Chuck?
- Yes, I am.
- And who is she in love with?
- Well, me.
Then you protect her.
I'm taking the gang back to town.
I refuse to leave Janis alone in this house.
Okay, then take her with you, but let's get out of here.
Yeah, but... But Kay, wait.
What about our clothes?
Clothes are no good to a dead man.
Come on.
Be reasonable, Kay.
JUDGE: Where are you rushing to?
- I'm not rushing to, I'm rushing from.
There's something going on in this house that I don't want any part of. Goodbye.
Well, does Janis know you're leaving?
We're taking Janis with us.
[WOMEN MURMURING]
- Oh, what a lovely dress.
- Thank you.
WOMAN: Happy birthday.
- Just a minute. Please, girls.
Now that we're here, Janis, where are the men?
WOMAN: That's right, where are the men?
- Quiet, wolves. Just take it easy.
For you, I've invited eight hand-picked campus heroes...
...and they'll be here any minute.
So come on over here.
WOMAN: Now we're talking.
JANIS: I wasn't sure everybody...
- Pardon me, Miss Bellacrest...
- Oh, Kay, I want you to meet my friends.
Ladies, this is Kay Kyser.
- How do you do?
WOMAN: Nice to meet you.
- May I see you a minute, please?
- Why, surely. I'll be right back.
- Listen, there's something we must tell you.
- Believe me, Janis, this isn't my idea.
I hope you won't misunderstand, but I've decided...
[EXPLOSION NEARBY]
WOMAN 1: Over here.
WOMAN 2: What is it?
[MURMURING]
MAN 1: Hey.
MAN 2: Get back.
[MURMURING]
- Jurgen, what's happened?
- It's the bridge, miss.
It just went up in smoke.
- The bridge? The one we just came over?
- Yes, miss.
[WOMEN MURMURING]
JUDGE:
There's no cause for alarm, ladies.
The bridge has been struck by lightning.
I saw it from the window upstairs.
Tonight of all nights this would have to happen.
Oh, now don't worry about it, honey.
It isn't your fault.
There's really nothing for your guests to fear...
...so please don't let it spoil your party.
Janis, didn't you say that bridge was the only way to the house?
Oh, yes, it is. Or rather it was.
Isn't going to be much of a party, is it?
It's the only real adventure I've had since my first blind date.
[LAUGHING]
Well, if we're going to stay here all night,
I'd better call my mother.
Oh, go right ahead.
Isn't it dreadful?
All of us girls here, and no men.
Golly, that's a shame.
[SIGHS]
Operator? Hello?
The telephone is probably dead.
The storm, you know.
Oh.
- We're really stuck.
- I can't control lightning.
Will you have the boys play something?
It'll help quiet things down.
- Why certainly.
- Thank you.
- What were you going to tell me?
- Tell you?
- Yes. You know, when Kay called me aside.
- Oh, that. Well, uh...
See, Kay want the band out the other end of the ballroom, but I talked him out of it.
Oh, I see.
Well, come on then, let's go.
Girls, let's go into the ballroom.
Kay and the boys are gonna play.
Come on.
[WOMEN MURMURING]
[BAND PLAYING
"YOU'VE GOT ME THIS WAY"]
Children, I want you to hear a handsome lad who really sings a song.
It's Harry Babbitt.
[SINGING]
I've gotten so
That I don't even know
If heaven is blue
All I retain in my poor addled brain
Is you
'Cause you've got me this way
Say
What are you gonna do about it?
What are you gonna do about it?
You've got me this way
Crazy for you
Mm, you kissed me one day
Then seeing that I was true about it
What did you go and do about it?
You left me this way
Bluer than blue
You thought it was funny
My falling so hard
I'm laughing my sides off, honey
Oh, you're really a card
You've got me this way
Say
Now that I'm in a stew about it
What am I gonna do about it?
I'm just gonna stay
Crazy for you
You've got me this way
Say
Oh, you've got me this way
Say
Now that I'm in a stew about it
What am I gonna do about it?
I'm just gonna stay
Crazy for you
That was great, Harry. Thanks a lot.
And thank you, belles of Bellacrest with no boyfriends.
This thunderous applause from so vast a multitude of music lovers...
...makes us purr with pleasure.
And if the patrons of this palatial parlor will permit...
...we'd like to do another number.
Thank you, and we're ready.
Gentlemen, be seated.
That's what I said. A one, a two.
[BAND PLAYING "BAD HUMOR MAN"]
[SINGING]
Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling
It's the bad humor man
[SINGING] Hey, little kiddies
Do you hear that noise?
[SINGING]
You better fly, better fly, better fly
[SINGING]
Here comes the enemy of girls and boys
Oh, what a guy, what a guy, what a guy
Hear him yell
Hear his bell
So drop your velocipedes
And drop your toys
And run pell-mell
Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling
It's the bad humor man
Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling
With a frown on his pan
He's a gloomy Gus
And a grouch on wheels
He's one of America's foremost heels
So he sings, "Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling"
As he goes on his way
With his wagon rumbling
He keeps grumbling
It sure is an awful day
KAY:
Oh, boy, school is out. School is out.
London Bridge is falling down
Three blind mice
See how they run
London Bridge is falling down
[IN CHILD'S VOICE]
I wanna play too.
Old MacDonald had a farm
- Throw me that ball, Rusty.
- Hey, look, kids, the bad humor man.
Oh, boy, I want a chocolate one.
- Can I have a vanilla?
- I'd like a little peach.
And could you give me a raspberry, mister?
With pleasure, kiddie.
[SINGING]
Oh, up every morning at the break of day
What a life, what a life, what a life
Cold cup of coffee on the breakfast tray
What a wife, what a wife, what a wife
[SINGING AS CHILDREN]
All day long
Things go wrong
And so as I wander on my weary way
I sing this song
- Ting-a-ling
- Ting-a-ling
- Ting-a-ling
- I'm the bad humor man
- Ting-a-ling
- Ting-a-ling
- Ting-a-ling
- With a frown on my pan
He's mean as Simon, I mean Legree
Yes, I hate people and they hate me
So he sings, "Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling"
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
As he goes
[AS CHILD]
On his way
With my wagon rumbling
I keep a-grumbling
Low, what a wowsy day
That's no way to act
Now, why be mad?
Well, business is good
But my humor's bad
Then come on, kids
With your musical toys
They'll make you
One of the happiness boys
Thank you, kiddies, for the helping hand
You made me smile and it sure feels grand
Then keep on smiling and join the band
[APPLAUDING]
Well, I'm a few hours early, but here's to your 21 st birthday.
- Thank you.
- Darling.
Today, I am a man.
[KAY CHUCKLES]
And now I'll let you in on a secret.
I had a beautiful surprise planned tonight for Aunt Margo's favorite rug maker...
...but it went haywire.
You mean Prince Saliano?
Prince?
He's a prince like I'm the Queen of Sheba.
I did a little snooping when I arrived today.
And I found that poor Aunt Margo's been subsidizing...
...that turban-topped Svengali for months and months.
- On the level?
- Mm-hm.
She's already given him a young fortune for the relief...
...of unemployed spirits or something equally silly.
If you think he's a phony, why don't you make him pack up his spirits...
...and take them back to the distillery?
- Aunt Margo is the boss, Kay.
You see, Daddy left her the house and most of his money.
I guess he thought it would spoil me less to struggle along with a small trust fund.
- But what about the surprise?
- Oh, that?
Have you ever heard of
Professor Karl Fenninger?
Isn't he the psychic expert who exposed all those fake mediums?
Exactly.
Well, I had Judge Mainwaring call him up and invite him to the party.
- Why didn't he come?
- Lightning trouble.
With that bridge down, he just won't be able to make it.
I hope I'm not intruding, Janis.
Oh, of course not, darling.
You're just in time.
I've been telling them about his royal slyness.
Oh. You made it clear, I hope...
...that I don't entirely share your opinion of Prince Saliano.
You see, my legal training teaches me not to jump to conclusions without proof.
I'll bet Professor Fenninger would have given you proof.
But anyway, now you know why I have no surprise.
- I think perhaps I have one for you, Janis.
- You have?
Yes.
Now, then, Miss Bellacrest...
...Miss Simms, Mr. Kyser, Mr. Deems.
Allow me to present
Professor Karl Fenninger.
I am honored.
Professor Fenninger.
I'm really happy to see you.
Thank you.
And, uh, please forgive me for eavesdropping...
...but just part of my profession.
But I don't understand.
How did you get here with the bridge down?
Oh, I arrived, of course, before the bridge collapsed, but, uh...
...I took the liberty of making a brief investigation...
...without announcing my presence.
Very clever of you, professor.
Yes, very clever.
Incidentally, mademoiselle,
I owe you an apology.
- An apology?
- That face you saw at your window...
...it was mine.
Oh, professor, you've made me feel better already.
- Dinner is served, Miss Bellacrest.
- Thank you.
Professor, you'll join us, of course?
- Come on, everybody. Judge?
- Yes.
Aren't you dining, judge?
I thought I'd have a cigarette first.
I think I will too.
Ah, The Man With the Golden Helmet.
Yes, Rembrandt.
He was indeed the master of them all.
JUDGE:
I think that's one of his best.
Observe that mysterious struggle between light and shadow.
Why is she still alive?
Saliano missed again last night.
We've missed too many times.
She'll certainly suspect something.
We won't miss tonight.
We must arrange for Saliano to conduct a seance.
I've planned to have it look like an accident when the room is in darkness.
[KAY WHISTLING]
JUDGE: Yes, I think Rembrandt chose the perfect subject for his time.
I beg your pardon, I forgot something.
I'm always leaving this case around somewhere.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
And by the way, dinner is served.
Who is this fellow, Kyser?
Some band leader.
We have nothing to fear from him.
He's perfectly harmless.
No, thank you.
- Kay, did you tell him?
- Not yet.
Come on and tell him now.
- Are you sure it'll be all right?
- I'm positive. Come on.
So you see, my work might be dangerous...
...but never boring.
Absolutely fascinating.
Pardon me, may I see you a moment, professor?
Madame, excuse me, please.
- Well, certainly. Of course.
- He is interesting.
Listen, professor.
Janis wants us to get Saliano to hold a seance so you can expose him.
She's convinced he's a faker.
That wouldn't surprise me at all.
Fine. Now, if we work together, you can be a great help.
I'll get him steamed up, then you hop in and challenge him...
...so he won't be able to back down.
Is that okay with you?
I couldn't have thought of a better plan myself.
Good.
I'm certainly glad you are here, professor.
Miss Bellacrest is a mighty nice girl...
...and I'd hate to see anybody take advantage of her.
Naturally.
- But we'll take care of her, won't we?
- Yes, indeed, we'll take care of her.
Oh, boy. Boy, I can hardly wait.
Am I going to enjoy this.
JANIS:
Attention, please.
Quiet, everybody.
I think with a little persuasion we might get Ginny Simms to sing for us.
[MURMURING]
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'd love to sing for you, but of course, we're really not prepared.
Are we boys?
MEN:
Oh, no, no. Not a bit.
[WOMEN LAUGHING]
[SINGING]
I'd know you anywhere
I'd know that grin
I'd know you anywhere
When you walked in
I would tingle with a single glance
In your eyes
Watching the starlight
Dance in your eyes
Mm, you saw my vacant stare
You understood
I'd love you anywhere
Honest, I would
I was certain this would happen
Strange as it seems
I'd know you anywhere
From my
Dreams
Mm, I'd know you anywhere
I'd know that grin
I'd know you anywhere
When you walked in

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'd know you anywhere
From my

This is splendid, delightful.
Thank you very much.
What beautiful quality, what tender expression.
Watch me go to work on him.
You have a real voice, my dear.
It's criminal to waste it on such trash.
That may be trash to you, Prince Saliano, but modern music is our business.
Oh, you know what I mean, prince.
We have our business and you have your business.
Please do not refer to my calling as a business.
Oh, no offense. I just meant that everybody has to stick to his own racket.
Racket?
Do you dare to suggest that the practice of the occult sciences is a racket?
Do not merely suggest it, Mr. Kyser, insist upon it.
If you are trying to provoke me,
Professor Fenninger...
...you're wasting time.
Your guest is unbearably rude, Janis.
Professor Fenninger,
I demand you apologize to Prince Saliano...
...for daring to question his integrity.
Forgive me, madam. I simply meant
I should enjoy witnessing one of these...
...so-called, uh, psychic manifestations.
So-called?
Prince Saliano,
I insist that you conduct a seance at once.
- But Miss Bellacrest...
- I insist.
I will not have these people think we are fools.
Very well. For you, I will do it.
But I warn you, for those who scoff at their existence...
...the spirits consider no punishment too drastic.
- We're going to have a seance.
- Do you see spirits?
- Isn't it exciting?
- What happens?
You were great, you were terrific.
Thanks a lot, professor,
I appreciate your cooperation.
And I appreciate yours.
This is just what I wanted to happen.
Dear, do you think your birthday party is the proper place to hold a seance?
It's the perfect place to cure Aunt Margo.
Come on, everybody, let's go to the ballroom. Come on, girls.
Chuck. Ginny, you can walk with us.
This is kind of thrilling.
[MURMURING]
Ish, why do you suppose the prince wears that towel around his head?
Well, he probably just washed his hair and he can't do a thing with it.
Oh.
[CHUCKLES]
Why do I have to waste my time outwitting morons?
Make sure not to be near her chair when it happens.
- It must look accidental.
- Certainly.
The time is at hand.
Make ready for his exalted highness...
...Prince Saliano of Rahlahipur.
You will notice a pair these spheres...
...guarding every entrance and exit of this room.
Any interference that breaks the invisible ray between them...
...will meet with destruction.
Lest anyone is tempted to toy with this instrument of death...
...let me demonstrate its effect.
[WOMEN SCREAM]
[WOMEN GASP]
This room is now sealed with the fire of death.
Let no one attempt to enter or leave.
[WOMEN GASP]
Boy, we're in trouble.
I wish I was back in the Palace Theatre.
You see, my dear professor, all the spheres are in excellent working order.
Yes, I'm convinced the room is very effectively guarded...
...but may I inspect that tent?
Please do.
[WOMEN GASP]
It is desirable to have sitters of both sexes.
Perhaps some of Mr. Kyser's musicians will oblige?
- Why, certainly. I'll sit in, Kay.
- Fine.
Harry, Ish, Sully.
- You don't mind, do you, fellas?
- Oh, no.
If I don't come back, call me up on a Ouija board.
- Are you satisfied, professor?
- Yes, I am.
Please continue.
Will you all kindly be seated?
JANIS: Come on, Ginny.
SALIANO: And you too, Mr. Kyser.
This is swell.
I'll be able to watch him better from there.
Excellent idea.
And remember, if you need help, you just yell.
Thank you.
Mr. Kyser, perhaps your excellent pianist...
...could play something, uh, suitable to the mood?
With pleasure.
- Acrobat music, Lyman.
- Mr. Kyser.
[WOMEN GIGGLING]
[PIANO PLAYING SOMBER MUSIC]
I shall ask Judge Mainwaring to assist me with the lights as usual.
If for any reason the trance must be broken, strike the gong three times.
I quite understand, Prince Saliano.
One thing more. Miss Bellacrest...
...the contact will be stronger with your aunt at one end of the semicircle...
...and you at the other.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
I like being end man.
- Kay, will you change with me, please?
- Why, certainly.
A change might do me good.
Presently I shall assume a state of trance...
...in which the higher mind merges with the astral portion of the human ego.
In that state, I shall command the spirit of Elmer Bellacrest.
Other spirits may make themselves known.
Speaking through the medium of sounds associated with them.
If you recognize them, answer quickly.
Now, everyone will join hands.
[WOMAN MURMURING]
Shucks, this is fun, isn't it?
[WOMAN MURMURING]
SALIANO:
You may dim the lights.
[CHANTING INCANTATION]
[CROWD GASPS THEN MURMURS]
WOMAN:
Where's it going?
[WOMEN SCREAM]

SALIANO:
The spirit of evil is trying to enter this room.
But have no fear, the fires of death will guard us.

I am near you.

SALIANO:
The great moment has come...
...for those who would commune with their lost ones.
[EERIE WAILING]
[IN EERIE VOICE]
I am Elmer.
I am Elmer.
I am so lonely.
Open the veil and let me through.
Janis.
Janis, believe.
Believe in Saliano.
Trust in him.
Janis, Janis.
Janis.
[WOMAN SCREAMING]
MAN 1: Oh, Janis. Oh, Janis.
MAN 2: Turn on the lights.
Give her some air.
Get her a drink of water.
[MURMURING]
- Sully, get some water. Janis.
- My dear.
- Is she all right?
- She wasn't hit, was she?
No, she fainted, she fell from her chair.
- It's lucky she fell before that chandelier did.
- Yes.
Will you all stand back, please?
Miss Bellacrest isn't hurt.
WOMAN:
Oh, my God. Poor Janis.
This man is not faking.
He's really in a trance.
The gong. He told Judge Mainwaring if...
[GONG CLANGS]
What has happened?
- Is anything wrong?
- Yes, there is something wrong.
My niece narrowly escaped a tragedy.
There is a disturbing influence here.
It's a good thing it disturbed your niece or she'd be a spirit now herself.
- You. You are the disturbing influence.
- Me?
Please don't excite yourself, Margo.
Miss Bellacrest, let me assist you to your room.
There, that's better, honey.
How do you feel?
Chuck, that face.
- My father's face.
- Don't think about it now, dear.
WOMAN 1: It's all right.
WOMAN 2: Janis, don't worry.
- Can't we take her upstairs?
- Yes, of course. Come on, darling.
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think that under the circumstances...
...we had better consider this evening at an end.
On behalf of Miss Bellacrest and her aunt...
...I apologize for this unfortunate accident.
Nobody can tell me that was an accident.
- Why, Saliano asked her to sit in that chair.
- Yes.
And if she hadn't changed seats...
...you would have been sitting under that chandelier.
- That's right.
- And you might not have fainted.
That's right.
What a night.
I hope we get out of this place alive.
Well, we got ourselves in, we'll have to get ourselves out.
We got ourselves in?
You got ourselves in.
All right, all right,
I'm doing the best I can.
At least Janis and Ginny are safe.
I personally saw that every door and window in their room...
...was locked and bolted.
- That reminds me.
- And I feel better being closer to them.
I hope you don't mind my staying here with you, Kay.
Oh, no. Oh, no. I don't mind.
I can go to my own room if you think my snoring will bother you.
No, no, I like a little snoring.
It soothes me.
Ha, ha, if I talk in my sleep, just ignore me.
Oh, I'll fall right asleep too, and then we'll talk things over.
And we've got plenty talk abou...
What's the idea?
Either I'm getting weak, or the dampness has this window swollen.
Why did you close that?
We won't be able to breathe in here.
That's why I closed it, so we'll keep on breathing.
I'm surprised at you acting the way you are.
Wait till I tell your Scout master about this.
Listen, one man handles our legal affairs because he's a lawyer.
You manage our business because you're a manager.
But this is a matter of keeping my skin whole...
...and brother, you're no taxidermist.
I'll handle this my way.
Well, you beat me.
Yeah, I beat you and you beat me.
But I don't want anybody else to come in and beat the both of us.
Well, if anybody gets in here now, he'll have to come down the chimney.
Say, I could swear there's a draft in this room.
Oh, you're anemic.
You know something, Chuck,
Janis is absolutely right.
That Saliano is a phony.
- Yeah? How can you tell?
- Oh, I can tell just by looking at a man.
Now, you take Fenninger.
I took one look at him and I knew I could trust him with my life.
- Kind of gift, I guess.
- Wonderful thing.
Yes, sir.
With Fenninger in this house,
I feel a lot safer.
Well, good night, Chuck.
Night.
[GIGGLES]
[CHUCK BABBLES]
Hey, what's the matter with you?
What is it?
Look, over there.
I don't see anything.
Why, it's gone.
There was a little white thing and it was swaying like this.
You stop that. Go back to sleep.
There's nothing in this room and you know...
Aah...
[KAY SHRIEKS]
[BOTH WAILING]
KAY:
Oh, it's under the covers, Chuck!
CHUCK: It bit me! Get out of here!
- Do something!
KAY: Hurry up, do something.
- Get out of here.
KAY: Chuck, get him!
- There's fur on it!
Quick, now. Hold me up, Chuck. Run.
CHUCK: Stay with him, Kay. I'll get him.
Gotta find something.
Hold him, Kay.
Go on, Prince. Beat it, get out of here.
Kay, wake up.
Come on, Kay, snap out of it.
Students!
You're not on the air now.
You passed out.
- Oh, did I?
- Yeah.
Prince paid us a little surprise visit and nearly scared us to death.
- Oh, is that what was in the bed with us?
- Uh-huh.
But, uh, what happened to that white thing?
I don't know. It disappeared when the dog got under the covers.
That's funny, it was wagging back and forth like a dog's tai...
That's it, Prince's tail.
Since when does Prince's tail light up in the dark?
I'll show you. Turn off those lights.
Hey, Prince.
Hey, Prince. Look.
Nice Prince. Nice doggy.
- Well, can you imagine that?
- Here, Prince.
- Here, Prince. Come on, boy.
- Come on, Princey.
[LAUGHING]
This, as Shakespeare said, is an interesting "tail."
Lights out again, Chuck.
- I knew it. I knew it.
- You knew what?
Chuck, this stuff is phosphorous paint.
That's what made his tail glow.
Now, what else did we see tonight that did that?
- You mean that glowed in the dark?
- Yes.
I don't reme...
- Good night. At the seance.
- Right, those faces.
Why, it's as simple as shooting fish in a bucket.
- Oh, boy.
- Wait a minute, where are we going?
To Professor Fenninger.
Wait till he hears about this.
Don't you think we'd better wait until morning?
Maybe you're right.
The sensible thing is to stay behind locked doors.
Now you're talking. Behind locked doors.
- Hey, how did Prince get in here?
- Oh, why he came in through the...
- Prince.
- Here, Princey.
- Princey. How did you get in here?
- Where are you?
[WHISTLES]
KAY: Princey. Prince.
- Princey.
- Why, he's gone.
- Say, what is this?
Now, we not only don't know how he got in...
...but we also don't know how he got out.
Hey, Prince.
[PRINCE BARKING]
- There's your answer.
- A secret panel.
I told you there was a draft in here.
Here, take this flashlight.
If we can find out where Prince got that phosphorous on his tail...
...we may find out a lot of other things.
- Well, here we go.
CHUCK:
Oh!
CHUCK: Nice cheerful little place, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Either it was built this way, or they have awful big mice around here.
- Look, a light switch.
- Turn it on.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
I thought it was a light switch.
You also thought it was a good idea to come out here.
- Would you mind?
- Hmm? Oh.
If you ever catch me near a secret panel again, don't argue with me, slug me.
With pleasure.
- Hey, you'd better shield that light.
- You're right.
- Let's be nice and quiet.
- Yeah.
[METAL CLANKING]
- That's the stuff, nice and quiet.
- Shh...
- Aah!
- I got you. I got you.
What's the matter with you, Kay?
Don't you know a dummy when you see one?
You don't really want me to answer that, do you, Chuck?
That's all I'd need, to get hit on the head with a thing like that.
[KAY SCREAMS]
Benny Goodman fan.
Hey, where are you?
You tell me.
- Oh.
- What's the matter?
Something flew in my eye.
I wish it was the plane for Los Angeles.
Hey, easy now, don't lose me.
Could we be lost any worse than we are now?
- Wait a minute, Kay.
- Give me your hand.
Say, your fingers are swollen.
And, boy, do you need a manicure.
- Not so fast.
- Funny acoustics in here.
You sound far away.
I am far away.
Chuck!
Aah!
CHUCK:
Kay! Where are you, Kay? Kay...
Lay off of him. Kay!
Keep cool, Kay. I'll get him.
He's weakening.
Let him up.
I'm gonna beat your brains out.
- I'm all right.
- Yeah, you're all right, but how about Kay?
Kay's underneath this thing that l...
Don't get so excited.
What's wrong with you?
- Which way now?
- Let's follow Prince.
He can see as well as we can and he smells better.
Unless I'm mistaken, we came out to the garden the hard way.
CHUCK:
Hard way is right.
Last time I stayed under ground that long,
I came out in Brooklyn.
Where do you suppose they keep the soap and towels?
[WHISTLING NEARBY]
Somebody behind that hedge is giving signals.
- Saliano?
- I don't know.
But we're gonna find out.
All right, on your feet.
KAY:
Ish.
- I'm sorry, Ish.
- What was it, a cloud burst?
- Why are you prowling around out here?
- Well, I was only looking for Prince.
He's been gone awful long.
What made you take Prince out this time of the night?
Why, Kay, you know how headstrong he is.
How about getting back in the house?
I've got a feeling we're being watched.
Let's take a look around the garden first.
- Hey, what's he looking for?
- Phosphorous.
Oh.
Phosphorous.
- Hey, did you...?
- Shh!
Did you come out through the front door or the garden door?
We came out through that fountain.
- Through the fountain?
- Yes.
Oh.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
- What are you doing to that sundial?
- Setting it. It was two hours slow.
Ish, I wish I had known you when you were alive.
[PRINCE BARKS]
Hey, Prince.
Prince, come on, boy. Come on.
[EERIE WAILS PLAYING

[FOOTSTEPS APPRO ACHING]
[PHONE BEEPING]
Yes?
To your room?
I'll come immediately.
- Kay?
- Kay?
- Are you here?
- Are you here?
- Who are you, Little Sir Echo?
- Little Sir Echo?
Oh, never mind. Now, you stay here.
I'm gonna see if he's with Sully and Harry.
Little Sir Echo.
[CHUCKLES]
That's a good one.
Kay.
Kay.
Kay.
Oh, there you are.
- What are you doing?
- I was looking for you.
- In a bureau drawer?
- Well, I looked all...
- Where did you disappear to?
- Never mind that.
I'm glad you're all here.
Listen, fellas, we're in trouble.
- Did you just find that out?
- Stop clowning.
There's something terrible going on in this house.
Somebody's trying to murder Janis Bellacrest.
- Murder?
- Yes. They've tried tonight and missed.
And I'm positive they'll try again.
Good night.
We better get Ginny out of her room.
What, and leave Janis all alone?
- That's right, we couldn't do that.
- That's one reason.
If we did move Ginny, whoever is out to get
Janis would know we were onto something.
But I've got a better idea.
- Well, let's have it.
- We've got to steam up another seance.
- What?
- Another seance?
You mean we gotta get them spirits up again tonight?
Look, I think Saliano's running this racket, but he can't be doing it alone.
And until we find out who's in with him, nobody's safe.
Which would you rather do, take a chance on being strangled in bed or die like men?
Well, I'm tired.
If I have to die,
I'd just as soon die in bed.
- Are you with me, fellas?
- Sure we are.
- You can count on us.
- Come on.
- Where to now?
- You all wait here.
I'm gonna get Professor Fenninger.
Yes, sir. I love playing for the 400.
Professor Fenninger.
Professor Fenninger.
Psst.
- [WHISPERING] Did you hear them too?
- [WHISPERING] Hear what, professor?
Why, I thought I heard voices, so I went to make sure Miss Bellacrest was safe.
You heard us talking in my room.
Say, do you have a gun?
I'm never without one.
- Never.
- Good.
I'm convinced there are dangerous criminals in this house.
And I think I know how we can catch them.
Oh, you do? How?
You've gotta make Saliano hold another seance.
- Another... But why?
- I'll explain later.
Suppose Saliano refuses?
Judge Mainwaring can make him do it.
Do you think he'll help us, professor?
Oh, I can depend on the judge, but are you certain your plan will work?
As long as you can shoot straight, you haven't a thing to worry about.
That's true.
All right, I'll speak to the judge.
And thank you for taking me into your confidence.
Well, I wouldn't think of making a move without you.
- Shh.
- Shh.
Boy, he's a wicked-Iooking man, that Prince Saliami.
- Well, what did he say?
- Fellas, we're set.
If this works, somebody's gonna get a terrible shock tonight.
I hope it isn't me,
I don't think I could stand it.
Now, here's what we do...
Another seance?
That's ridiculous, of course.
On the contrary, the suggestion of our friend, Mr. Kyser, suits us beautifully.
Are you mad?
There's no time to be wasted on Saliano's nonsense.
We have to get rid of the girl.
But you forget it's much easier to arrange an accidental death downstairs...
...than in Janis' bedroom.
Yes, but if I proposed another seance, it would surely arouse suspicions.
You won't propose it.
Margo Bellacrest will demand it.
Oh.
I see.
And one more thing.
You watch Mr. Kyser very carefully.
If he should attempt to leave the ballroom...
But what about the accident?
If she should happen to step between the electrical spheres of the darkness...
...it would be tragic.
But obviously accidental.

I must speak...

Tell Saliano.
Yes, Elmer, I'll tell him.
I'Il... I'll get him at once.
EDDIE:
I don't either.
Isn't Joan coming down?
She and Dolores said they wouldn't come down to see the Spirit of '76.
They're silly. In a house like this,
I don't wanna be alone...
...unless I have plenty of people around me.
KAY:
Hey, don't worry. I know it'll work.
Oh, gentlemen, everything is all set.
Ginny and Janis are locked safely in their room...
...and I left two of the boys to look after them.
- Very wise precaution.
- I'll say it is.
Well, let's get going.
Janis will be down.
I'll see to that myself.
- Oh, Prince Saliano.
- Yes, Mr. Kyser?
Miss Bellacrest said to go right ahead.
- She's, uh, been delayed.
- I see.
Oh, and by the way, you do want music, don't you?
If it is not too much trouble.
Trouble?
Why, this time I shall conduct personally.

JANIS: Hurry.
- What are you doing here?
- Can't be any worse than it was up there.
I told you to stay in that room.
Somebody tried to carve their initials on Janis.
MARGO:
Janis?
- We're waiting, dear.
- Chuck, what will I do?
We've gotta go through with this.
You'll take care of her, won't you, professor?
Yes.
- And this time, you can depend on me.
- Good.
- I'll be right beside you.
- I'm going too.
Sully, you and Ish get in there.
They may need you.
A dearly beloved spirit wishes to contact us.

- All right, let me get him. Hurry up.
MAN 4: Oh, I got him.
- Hey, wait a minute, fellas, it's Kay.
ALL: What?
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
CHUCK:
The boys didn't know it was you...
...they thought it was that turban-topped
Hindu that was...
FENNINGER: Mr. Kyser.
- Yes, professor?
- Where's Saliano?
- Knocked out in the hidden room.
- How do you reach it?
- Through the settee.
- Wait, it's locked.
- We'll break it open.
You stay here,
I'll get them before they come to.
Fine. Remember, we're depending on you.
Prince Saliano. Oh, what a fool I've been.
And Judge Mainwaring.
But why should they want to kill you?
Well, I can tell you why. Here, read this.
- What is it, Kay?
- It's a codicil to your father's will...
...directing your Aunt Margo to turn everything over to you...
...on your 21 st birthday.
- But I don't understand.
Well, I do. The judge has been bleeding your aunt through Saliano.
With you handling the bankroll, they'd never get another quarter.
Oh, the swindlers, the thieves.
[STONE SHATTERS GLASS]
KAY: This window.
MEN: The window.
MAN: Will you let me in, please?
- Who are you?
I am Professor Karl Fenninger.
MEN:
Fenninger?
Why, you can't be Professor Fenninger.
Professor Fenninger is down in that secret room...
[WOMEN SCREAM]
Stand back!
And throw up your hands, all of you.
You're a very clever young man,
Mr. Kyser.
See how many clever things you can think of in the few minutes...
...before this explosive blows you all to bits.
You can't kill all these people like that.
It's crazy. It's mass murder.
You'll never get away with it.
Identifying your bodies will be rather difficult.
I daresay the police will assume that ours are among them. Light that fuse.
Goodbye, Mr. Kyser.
I regret that our acquaintance should be blown up so soon.
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
Don't do this! Don't do it!
[YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
Drop it.
Drop it!
- Drop it!
WOMAN: Watch out.
Drop it! Drop it!
Look out.
Drop it! Drop it!
Prince, put it down! Drop it!
Go away! Get away! Prince!
- What's the matter?
- He's got it again.
Prince.
[BARKING]
- He's catching them.
- Drop it.
- Drop it.
- Drop it.
Look, he's chased them into the bushes.
Poor little Princey, poor little pup.
[D YNAMITE EXPLODES]
He was such a nice dog.
I know I should have been kinder to him.
Prince was a hero, Ish.
We'll build a monument to him.
Sure we will.
[PRINCE BARKING]
What's that?
- It's Prince!
- Prince!
Hey, it is. It's Prince.
Oh, Princey, come to Papa.
- Come on, boy.
- Come on, Princey.
Well, that's that.
Now, if anybody knows how to build a bridge, we can go home.
Oh, Mr. Kyser, how can I ever thank you?
Well, how can I ever thank you, ma'am?
Thank me? For what?
That gadget that talks like the wind.
It gave me a great idea for a band number.
We're gonna let our instruments speak for themselves.
[BAND PLAYING MEDLEY]
Tonight, we present a new miracle of electricity, the Sonovox.
Harry Babbitt, using special Sonovox units...
...gives diction to the tones of the instruments as they play.
Harry forms the words, but the instruments sing them.
Sing it, saxes.
[SINGING IN EERIE VOICE]
I'd know you anywhere
I'd know that grin
I'd know you anywhere
When you walked in
I would tingle with a single glance
In your eyes
Watching the starlight
Dance in your eyes
You've got me this way
Say
What are you gonna do about it?
What are you gonna do about it?
You've got me this way
Crazy for you
Now Ginny will bring you
Something she'd like to sing you
- I'd like to sing "One Track Mind."
- We'll be listening.
Mm, I've got a one-track mind
It's got a point of view
All the day long
It's busy with thoughts of you
HARRY:
That's lovely, Ginny
I've got a one-track heart
Can't call my heart my own
Early and late
It's beating for you all alone
For you alone
- I've got
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] I've got
BOTH:
The stubbornest pair of arms
That reach in your direction
[IN EERIE VOICE]
I've got a pair of lips
That long for your affection
- But having a one-track mind
- One-track mind
- Has its advantage too
- One-track mind
It keeps telling me
To tell you that I love you
And I must do
What my one-track mind tells me to do
Hold it, fellas. I knew there was something I wanted to tell you.
Ladies and gentlemen of the motion-picture audience...
...we've had a lot of fun making our picture and we certainly hope you've enjoyed it.
But there's one thing
I want to get clear in your mind.
Remember Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre,
Bela Lugosi?
Well, they aren't really murderers at all.
In fact, they are nice fellows and good friends of mine.
You know, things like this don't actually happen.
It's, uh, all in fun.
And so we'll be on the air, as usual, next Wednesday night.
And until then, we'll be thinking of you.
So long, everybody.
[ENGLISH SDH]
San Stefano, ladies and gentlemen...
The public square...there will be a 45 minute stop.
Santa Maria Narella Church...
Refreshment...at the café.
Postcards, curios, souvenirs...across the street.
Please remember we have to leave in 45 minutes.
Thank you.
Waiter...
Waiter!
Are you looking for a match?
Sì, signore...grazie...thank you very much.
- You desire?...
- 2 coffees and a couple of sandwiches.
- Salami
- Not salami!
I beg your pardon?
I know this place very well.
I would not recommend the salami. 
But the cheese isn't bad.
Thank you...Two cheese sandwiches and some coffee.
And as for me...a double brandy, Horatio.
Mind if I sit down for a moment?
It's so nice to meet people from the 'States.
You speak English very well!
Are you a native...
I mean an Italian?
No, I'm an American... have you been in Italy long?
No, we just arrived... from Switzerland.
- Nice little country, Switzerland.
Yes...It would not be so little if they could only flatten it out.
That's a good one...
I'll have to write that to the boys...!
"If they could only flatten it out!"
But how could they ever...?
La signora likes Italy?
I think it's wonderful...
It's our first trip!
There are many treasures in these little towns, but you have to get off the beaten path.
- They're hard to find.
- What do you mean?
I happen to be a collector.
I find things in private homes for example that are of great value.
One can buy them for a song.
Only this morning, as it happens, 
I came across cameos... of the finest most minute workmanship.
And absolutely authentic.
15th century, mostly.
Could I...could we see them?
I love cameos!
They're not often as beautiful as this...
I was most fortunate.
Forgive my appearance...
But that is so they do not
 take me to be wealthy.
You see, I buy for lire and sell in London and New York for pounds and dollars.
It is not so much the money that interests me...
It is the pleasure and difficulty of the search.
Do let us see them!
Oh...they're lovely!
They knew how to make these things in the old days.
Now this one is really a museum piece.
Feel the sharpness of the relief!
The smoothness of the mottled surfaces.
That is a portrait of Savonarola...
You've heard of Savonarola?
Oh, yes! Yes, of course.
I'm thinking of having it mounted into a ring...
Or perhaps as a pendant with 2 small diamonds.
Oh yes!...As a pendant!
Oh, permit me if you will...
Put it on my bill, Horatio!
Could I ask you how much you'd have to pay for a thing like that?
I'm almost ashamed to tell you...
About...50 lire.
That's around 10 dollars?
But these people know nothing of values.
Would you sell it?
Of course!  I'll sell it to my brokers in London.
Oh, no...
I mean a quick turnover.
I'll give you 50 for it, right now.
But caro signore, that is exactly what I paid for it.
Wait a minute...
50 dollars gives you plenty of profit.
Did you say dollars?
That's what I said.
It's not the money, I assure you... but I find it hard to bear a lady's disappointment.
- There you are!
- Edward...you darling!
It is sometimes more important to bring happiness into the world than to make money.
-Thank you!
-Arrivederci!
Au revoir!
What a charming young man!
Signor Conrad!
Ovidio!...and how is the Commissario of Police?
Oh, I'm well, very well thank you.
But Signor Conrad, 
I must remind you again that it is unlawful to sell anything here without a licence.
- You mean the Americans?
- Yes.
But you could not call that selling.
After all, I paid 50 for it... and received 50 for it.
Well, that is a fair exchange.
Very fair.
But of course you are aware of the law that forbids the export of authentic antiques without a special permit.
My dear Commissario,
I am well aware of every law.
I would not dream of dealing in 
"authentic antiques."
And now if you'll forgive me, 
I'm expected at the Villa Francesca.
Oh yes...I presume it is to say goodbye to Signorina...Julia.
Julie? Is she going away?
She asked me for her exit permit a few hours ago.
Oh, I hope I have not given away a secret, eh?
No, not at all...
She would have told me.
- Good day.
- Good day!
Give signorina my fondest regards.
It's Bruce Conrad, Mr Ingram.
You asked him to come up today.
Oh, yes...I remember.
Hello, Julie.
Signor Ingram...you're looking exceptionally well today.
No Bruce...not with me.
Save that for the tourists.
But I really mean it...
You ARE looking well.
And it's reflected in your playing.
I've been listening.
You played masterfully.
Do you think so?
Now that all my strength I have left is concentrated in these fingers...
Exactly.
The power, the tonal quality, the prodigious technique...
You have suffered no loss, and the world has gained another miracle.
Yes...perhaps you're right.
Julie...since you came, 
I've found new life.
A new source of energy... a strong ambition to live.
- and enjoy...   - I've only tried to take care of you, Mr Ingram.
No...you've done much more than that.
You've brought beauty before my eyes.
The beauty I've always loved and always sought.
You wanted to see me, Mr Ingram.
To see you?  
Oh yes, of course...
You'll have dinner with us.
I shall be delighted.
I'm expecting Duprex my lawyer from Rome.
You must meet him.
I want Hilary to be present, too.
- Shall I tell him?
- Yes. but don't leave me alone too long.
Mr Conrad will stay with you.
I'll still be alone...I'm always alone... with everyone.
Except with her.
You understand?...
Except with Julie.
I need her, Bruce.
How about a game of chess?
You want to take money away from me...again!
The money doesn't matter... but just to make it interesting...
How about 10 lire a game?
Don't you feel well?
Just tired.
He's very demanding, isn't he?
Oh, but Julie, I know he has to go to Milan to see his doctor.
You're going with him.
The change will do you good.
While you're there you can take in the opera... 
- and meet new people.
- That won't help very much.
What I need is a complete change.
Hilary...I've been thinking seriously of going home.
No...please don't...if you go what will happen to my work?
What has my going away to do with your work?
Don't you see Julie, since you've been  looking after him... he's forgotten about me and I've had time for my studies.
If I go, he'll have another nurse to look after him.
Not if you leave... he won't let me out of his sight.
I need every minute of the day for my work...
I have to stay around here in this library...
And these books and these shelves have the great secrets I'm after.
The key to the future... It was only known only to the ancient astrologists.
It's been lost since the burning of the Alexandrian library.
And now I'm about to rediscover them!
If I'm left alone just a little while longer, 
I have it!
Please stay!  
You must stay 'til I find it!
Hilary, you know I'd like to help you, but...
- Julie! Julie!
- It's Mr Ingram calling.
Oh, I nearly forgot...he wants you to have dinner with us tonight.
When did you decant this wine, Antonio?
This afternoon, Signor Ingram.
It's cloudy.
You haven't eaten anything since this morning, Mr Ingram.
You take good care of me, Julie...
You notice everything.
Everything.
And I don't need food.
You may wonder why I asked you to have dinner with me tonight.
It's because this is a special occasion.
And a very important one.
Hilary...do you know why you are here?
No, I don't.
Some anniversary, perhaps?
No, no such thing.
I merely want your testimony... that I am not insane.
It's very important to me to be certain that not one of you thinks 
I'm of unsound mind.
Bruce...you are an artist, a musician.
You've been with me a long time.
You've been with me constantly
Therefore you are in a position to speak.
Are you convinced that there is nothing wrong with...
...with my mental balance?
Your mental balance is equal to mine.
And while I consider that a tribute to your sanity... there are certain people in San Stefano who consider me slightly eccentric.
Perhaps they're right.
Hilary...you've been my secretary for the last 20 years.
Could you testify that I was always thinking rationally.
There's no question about that.
Julie, you of all people know me well.
I engaged you to look after me.
And you have become my friend.
Have you ever heard me say anything irresponsible?
- Think!
- No, Mr Ingram.
If you had to swear to it.
I don't think that question would ever be asked.
- Answer me!
- Yes, Mr Ingram, I would swear to it.
Mr Duprex...
You've just listened to the people who have known me best...
Now your testimony is of the greatest importance.
What's your impression of me?
I've no doubt you're able to think as clearly as anyone in this room.
None of us have ever doubted your mental health Mr Ingram.
I'm glad you all agree with me.
Duprex...
Bruce...
Hilary...
I want you to sign this document, as witnesses.
But what is it?  I'd like to read it before signing.
It's my will.
My last will and testament.
I hope my signature doesn't spoil its validity.
Will you kindly sign please.
To make a will is to think of death.
And to think of death is to anticipate the end.
Don't be alarmed...although I think of it, 
I don't anticipate it yet.
Julie will you be kind enough to take me into the hall.
Yes, Mr Ingram.
Come with me...all of you.
So you're going away, Julie.
Yes...how did you know?
There are 3 kinds of communication...
Telegraph, telephone, and the Commissario.
The Commissario of course, is the fastest.
Didn't you want me to know?
Yes, I would have told you, but until I'd spoken to Francis...
Why speak to Francis?
I don't understand.
Go abruptly, suddenly... without warning, without goodbyes.
I couldn't do that... it isn't fair.
"Fair"?  Has he been fair to you?
Yes, he's been fair.
But that isn't why I'm leaving.
I know Julie...you're afraid.
He's holding you with his pain and his helplessness.
He draws his energy from your life.
He'll never let you go.
But I MUST go!
But I can't leave without telling him.
It's your only chance.
He's had his life.
You have a right to yours.
But I thought you were his friend.
Yes...But I'm thinking of you.
For him I have only pity.
For you, something quite different.
You might not even believe me.
Tell me.
I love you Julie.
Why shouldn't I believe you?
Perhaps because I don't believe in myself.
And because I'm urging you to go... away from him and away from me. 
And you'd stay here.
When I first heard Francis Ingram in  his New York recitals...
...long before I ever came to know him...
He'd sit down and play through the compositions and the audience would cheer.
Then I found out that you'd written them.
It was YOU I was listening to.
It's you I hear now, when Francis plays your music.
There's genius in it.
Genius...all I did was transcribe Bach.
Gave him a chance to play again
Gave him new hope.
But it was a trick, a stunt, for a one-handed pianist.
Don't say that.
It's beautiful...it's inspired.
Then it must have been my last inspiration.
I haven't been able to write anything since.
What had I become?
Court jester to a cripple, dependent upon his charity.
A dealer in modern antiques.
You'll find yourself again.
You say that you love me, yet you want me to go away alone.
I do love you Julie.
But what have I to offer you?
Have I asked for anything?
I've something to offer you.
Hope.
Courage...devotion.
A new life.
Julie!
Julie!
Julie!
Did you call, Mr Ingram.
Anything I can do?
Julie...I want Julie
Where is she?
Don't you know?
I know where she is.
Well tell me...where is she?
She's in the garden.
She's not alone.
Mr Conrad is with her.
- Bruce?   - Yes.
I think Mr Ingram... they're going away together.
I'm afraid she will leave you.
Hilary...why do you lie to me?
I'm not lying.
- I'm telling you the truth.
- No!...
The truth is that you don't want anybody around here, close to me.
I heard what they said in the garden.
I couldn’t help but hear them.
- You are a liar!
- I am not a liar!
- You're afraid to hear the truth.
- Go away...I won't listen to you.
You must listen to me.
I even remember what they said.
He said:  "He's had his life.
You have the right to  yours."
And she said: "Yes I'll have to go."
He took her in his arms.
And he kissed her!
He kissed her!
Do you hear?  He kissed her!
Julie!....Julie!
Help!
She can't hear you, Hilary.
She's out in the garden, isn't she?
She's out in the garden with Bruce Conrad.
She couldn’t hear ME!
So how could she possibly hear YOU?
Mr Ingram...Mr Ingram...
Mr Ingram!
Get out of my house!
I never want to see you again!
Get out!
Thank you, Antonio.
I think you can go to bed now.
He seems to be resting quietly.
Good night, signorina.
I had to wait 'til Mr Ingram fell asleep.
He really did hurt you.
His fingers are like claws.
I'm sure if you hadn't come, he would have killed me.
How did it happen?
I don't know...
He asked for you, and I said you were in the garden...
So he started choking me.
I'm told to get out of his house.
He didn't mean what he said.
I'll talk to him in the morning.
Julie!
Julie!
Julie!
Julie!
Julie.
Ah...my old friend the Commissario.
Are you on guard against illegal sales or is this an expression of your unofficial sympathy,
This is no time for jests, 
Signor Conrad.
It was a dreadful accident, entirely unexpected.
Yes, accidents usually are.
Will you join me in a bit of marsala?
Merely to appease our mutual grief.
Oh, one glass, if you don't mind.
A la santé!
And, Signor Conrad, in a case like this...
Whom does one condole?
To whom does one express his grief and sympathy?
To me.  
I made a very fair living playing chess and gambling with him.
Eating his food, drinking his wine...
Now that he's gone...
I'm without doubt the chief mourner.
He had no family?
He left to no one?
Yes, there's a brother-in-law and a nephew just arrived from England.
You'll find them in the library.
Better you present me if you please, that I may offer proper consolation.
Of course...This way to the grief-stricken relatives.
Sorry to interrupt gentlemen... this is Signor Ovidio Castanio
...Commissario of police.
Mr Raymond Arlington and his son Donald.
Police?
Please Signor Conrad, explain....
I'm here merely to express my heartfelt sympathy... my profound regret, my deepest condolences on this unhappy occasion.
I think you've expressed it very well yourself.
Thank you very much.
Do you expect other members of the family to arrive?
We are his only relatives.
Francis was married to my sister.
Ah...you are American?
Yes...living in England.
What unearthly noise is that?
They're professional mourners.
They've been hired to chant until sunrise.
Unless you'd care to extend the time.
You mean they'll keep that up all  night?!
It is an ancient custom Mr Arlington.
Your brother-in-law was a man of great eminence in this community
It is only natural his passing should be attended by a certain amount of lamentation.
Our grief as you see, is very great.
But having known Francis well,
I'm sure he would have preferred that the lamentation be somewhat less vocal.
In a word, Commissario, ask those witches to stop howling.
As you say, signor...
I shall merely explain your desolation as very great... and under the circumstances you would prefer quiet and solitude.
The Commissario does have a way of putting things, doesn't he?
Dad, this has a crest with a bull and three swords
Yes, it once belonged to one of the Borgias.
The Borgias, eh?
Why that chest will bring at least £300 at Christies.
There's a small fortune in these books and antiques.
If you gentlemen are really interested in authentic antiques...
Look!...Roma, 1743.
La Vita de Lorenzo Borghese.
This is worth £100 at the British Museum.
History of the Constellation
Florence, 1603.
I wish you'd keep your hands off my books.
YOUR books?
Yes, they are mine!
They're part of the estate, and until the will is read...
No...they belong to ME!...
All of them...and I want you to keep away from them.
How did you get them?
On your salary?
Bought them...for me...
They are mine.
You leech! 
You've lived on Francis' charity for years.
Now you'll have to get out... you and your theories...
You won't live on MY charity.
The stars should have told you that!
Perhaps they told me more than you know.
Gentlemen...don't you think this discussion
 is somewhat premature?
I don't want him to touch my books.
For your information, Hilary...
I'm going to close this place as soon as Francis' will has been read.
All this stuff will be shipped to England,
 including of course, "your" books.
Julie...
The gentlemen downstairs are waiting for us.
But I have nothing to do with it.
I don't belong to the family.
Please tell them to go ahead without me.
What's wrong, Julie?
It's only reading of the will.
For some reason Mr Duprex wants you to be present.
I can't face Mr Arlington again.
It wouldn't have happened if I'd only stayed with Mr Ingram.
Why do you blame yourself?
Nobody expected him to crawl out of bed.
In a way I'm glad it happened while you were here. 
Supposing he'd died after you left...
You'd never have forgiven yourself.
It's all in the way you look at things, isn't it?
I suppose so.
I'm going to San Stefano tomorrow to get my exit visa.
Have you decided to leave with me?
Yes.
I wish we could get away from here right now.
It won't be long...
Only a few days.
In the meantime, keep your chin up.
Why?
So that I can kiss you.
Well, it's about time.
I beg your pardon.
Please...please be seated.
I've called you together for the reading of the will and testament of Francis Warren Ingram.
As witnessed by Hilary Cummins, Bruce Conrad, in the presence of Francis Ingram and myself.
I, Francis Warren Ingram being of sane mind and in full possession of my mental powers... herewith declare my last will.
I leave all my worldly goods, cash, property and valuables of whatever nature to Miss Julia Cecilia Holden, my companion and friend, as inadequate compensation for her kindness and devotion to me.
I wish my body to be interred in the ancient chapel adjoining the Villa Francesca, so I can be near to her and therefore rest in peace.
That is all.
- No word about me?
- None.
We shall contest that will.
On what grounds may I ask?
This will was made in consideration of her kindness and devotion.
His very words.
But it was her duty to stay with him and take care of him.
And if she had done so, Francis Ingram would be alive at this moment.
That's an insult to Miss Holden.
These are not insults, they're facts.
This woman is responsible for Francis' death.
You'll have a hard time proving that in a court of law.
That's a criminal charge.
I have no desire to place Miss Holden in a position of jeopardy.
But I shall do all in my power to have this so-called will thrown out of court.
I think you're needlessly alarmed, 
Mr Arlington.
You haven't asked Miss Holden of her own desires in the matter.
As far as I know, she hasn't the slightest intention of accepting any part of this magnificent bequest.
Is that true, Miss Holden?
Are you willing to resign your rights to the entire estate without further litigation?
In  view of the circumstances of my uncle's death...
That might be a very wise procedure.
I'm afraid Mr Conrad has mislead you.
I accept the legacy.
And furthermore I intend to remain here in this house.
Yes...and my books remain here too.
This thing isn't over yet.
Let me go!
What's the matter with him?
What's happened to his throat?
I believe that Francis Ingram tried to choke him.
That's interesting...why?
It seemed Mr Ingram resented...
Go on.
Oh, it's almost as if he suspected some kind of conspiracy between Hilary Cummins, 
Miss Holden and Mr Conrad.
What kind of a conspiracy?
Do you think he felt himself threatened?
It's hard to say.
Conspiracy...
That would explain who pushed Francis down the stairs.
Now look, Arlington, there's no evidence it was not an accident.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Mr Conrad's quite right.
The idea's absurd.
But even Mr Conrad has stated that 
Francis Ingram's behaviour was eccentric.
Did I?  When?
At the dinner table.
- I don't remember.
- But I do.
Excellent!
If my brother-in-law was not in full possession of his mental powers...
Don't count on me as a witness.
We won't have to... luckily there were others present.
I'm sure you "gentlemen" will excuse me.
You're quite right, they don't need Mr Conrad's testimony.
The things I saw during my short stay in this house would certainly be conclusive for any judge.
Duprex, you're a man of extreme perception.
Actually, as it happens, I know the existence of a former will, which names your son as sole heir.
Only a few months ago, 
Francis Ingram changed his mind.
I have the impression that he acted under a neurotic obsession.
Which certainly affected his willpower.
Then it would be simple to have this will annulled.
It would take a certain amount of handling.
Would you like me to represent you in the matter.
Of course.
Share? You mean your fee?
I said share.
What do you want?
For participation, let us say one third.
You understand I would offer my services to Miss Holden under the same circumstances.
You mean you'd help her instead of us?
I'm on the side of those who engage me.
Alright...will you take the case.
Tomorrow the will shall be broken.
There's a light in the mausoleum!
Strange...
No one here.
No!
Somebody was playing...
Did you hear it?
Of course I did.
Hilary...who was playing? i don't know...
I didn't see anybody.
The piano was closed when I went upstairs.
This has been locked since dear Mr Ingram died.
There...
Don...Donald!
It's Mr Ingram's ring!
He always put it there.
What are you trying to say?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
The music...it was his style... his technique...
I couldn't be mistaken.
What's the matter?
Come down here!
Dad!
Dad..quick!
Duprex!...He's dead!
No!...Don't touch him!
What?!
Send for the police.
The fingerprints on the key that locked the piano do not match any of yours, signorina, signore, or any of the servants.
That we have proved beyond doubt thanks to my colleague, Mr Bataillion.
To eliminate a possible clue is almost as good as finding one.
You mean you suspected one of us?
I do not suspect, Signor Conrad...
I am here merely to investigate.
Signore, please... a little closer.
Now let us be methodical...eh?
A murderer must have a motive.
Who would have gained by Mr Duprex' death?
Why don't we tell him, Dad?
Tell what?
Duprex could have proved that my uncle was insane.
And also that a former will exists which was made while he was still in his right mind.
Somebody in this room is just lucky that he died so suddenly.
I could scarcely strangle a man!
And I don't play the piano.
Because nobody's ever heard you, doesn't prove you can't play.
If you remember, I was upstairs when we heard the music.
So you were...but Duprex must have been dead by that time.
Fine reasoning, Arlington.
And how did the ring get on the piano?
You probably have an explanation
 for that, too.
Of course!...
Anybody could have taken the ring off 
Francis' hand and placed it on the instrument.
The marks on his throat... just like the ones I have.
I can still feel his fingers.
And it was Ingram playing that night... how about that?
I am not enough of a musician myself to recognise Francis' technique.
But this man is...in fact he is himself an expert pianist.
Thank you for the compliment.
But unfortunately, I wasn't here
 at the time.
Can you prove it?
Horatio can. 
He put me to bed at the inn.
But don't worry, Commissario, the whole mystery is easy to solve.
You see, Francis' ghost doesn't want this will contested. 
So he murdered Duprex.
And to leave a clue for the police he played the piano.
But there are no such things as ghosts,
 Signor Conrad...
In all my life I have never seen one.
For that matter, neither have I. 
But one can never be sure... can one?
I'm sure that a ghost would respond to a bullet between his ribs.
Somebody very much alive went into that vault last night.
We saw a light.
And who went to the mausoleum, 
Signor Donald?
I don't know...If I knew, don't you think I'd have told you?
Maybe.
But sometimes people tell me things after it's too late.
Signore...you did not have to come down here.
For me this is merely a matter of routine.
Do you wish to reconsider?
We are just as anxious as you are, 
Commissario.
And we are just as brave.
As you wish...
After you...
This window was not broken when we were here at the funeral.
I'm sure it wasn't.
The glass was smashed from the inside.
No one could possibly climb through
 a jagged little opening like that.
Somebody's been here.
This lid's been moved!
What did I tell you?...
That's how the ring was stolen.
Let's make sure.
Give me a hand with the lid.
Horrible!
He's cut off his own hand!
A corpse?!...Very likely, indeed!
Yes, a corpse...
The medic was positive he was dead when they buried him.
There's no doubt about it.
And even if he wasn't, his right side was paralysed.
There's fingerprints on the glass.
Better take it with us.
You take it...I might drop it.
No blood on the glass.
A keen observation...
Make a note.
Let us see if there are some other pieces of glass in the garden.
- There aren't any footprints.
- No...
The print of a hand.
Broke the window and climbed through.
And walked away.
Anna...Tessa...go in the house, quick!
Look at her, you will be cursed.
They've turned their eyes away...
All of them!
They believe that evil spirits can only be evoked by people who are Jettatori
And whoever lives at the Villa Francesca may possess the evil eye.
I don't want to stay here any longer.
Don't show them you're afraid.
That WILL convince them.
You're hurting me!
I'm sorry...
Guess I'm a bit rattled myself.
Horatio!
Signor Conrad...
Bring me some brandy and a coffee for la signorina.
You wanted proof.
Tomorrow the bakery will be closed to us.
The butcher will have no meat.
They'll try to starve us out of town, and if we don't leave...
I can't believe that people could be so superstitious.
It's their folklore.
They've been brought up on it for centuries.
I have been looking for you... and the signorina.
What's the bad news, Commissario.
The fingerprints on the piece of glass we picked up at the mausoleum... correspond with the imprint on the piano key.
- You mean it's the same hand?
- Precisely.
Then, it was Francis' hand that unlocked the piano?
And played?
Can you give me a better explanation, 
Signor Conrad,
I will only too happy to accept it.
I found the fingerprints of identical pattern in the library...in the hall...even on the window pane in your room, signorina.
Fingerprints not older than a day.
Are you sure of it?
In my mind there is no doubt the hand is walking around.
You don't believe in things like that.
Unfortunately, for the peace of our souls, one cannot explain everything logically that happens in this world, Signor Conrad.
So, even the Commissario is afraid of 'jettatora'.  
Horatio!
Where's my drink?
I'm sorry...It might be better if you were served elsewhere.
There's the money I owe you.
Now bring us something to drink.
I can refuse service to anybody.
Let's get away from here, 
Bruce...please!
You're right signorina...It would be much more comfortable in my office...please come.
What for?
Merely to ask a few questions, 
Signor Conrad.
May I be so bold as to ask where you got all of that money?
Francis Ingram gave it to me.
Oh...he did?
Why? 
I asked him for it.
After all, he owed it to me.
Sometimes I can't help but wonder why a man of your education and background chooses to bury himself in our little village.
Well you can stop wondering, 
Commissario.
I was just on my way to get an exit visa from you.
Thank you.
Signorina...after Signor Ingram was stricken in New York... he brought you along to take care of him?
Yes. Mr Ingram had the choice of many nurses.
I am not surprised that he chose you, signorina.
I would have done the same, believe me!
But recently Signorina asked for her exit permit, too.
And now she seems to change her mind?
No, I've decided to leave here as soon as  possible.
I see.
Did you know that the signorina, after little more than a year in Signor Ingram's service, would have the good fortune of inheriting all of his wealth?
Of course not.
Then why do you want to leave with her?
Has this something to do with her sudden inheritance?
What's the reason for these questions?
Well, when a man picks up his living, as you do, collecting so-called antiques...
One is naturally a bit curious.
Is that not so?
Have you a match, please?
Where were you the night of the accident, 
Signor Conrad?
I told you...Horatio can testify that I was at the inn.
And the night the lawyer was murdered?
In bed.  Horatio brought me a hot drink.
May I have your passport, signorina?
Thank you.
What does that mean?
It is merely routine.
In the meantime I suggest that you stay at the villa.
I shall be there too.
I have no doubt we shall see a great deal of each other.
Please come.
Still working, I see.
Yes, I am.
Well, it's after midnight.
Then why aren't you asleep?
Tell me, Hilary...
Just what do you expect to find?
The law that changes the conception of unknown fate into very predictable fact.
Sounds like a lot of nonsense to me.
Why don't you let me finish?
Applying that knowledge to your life
I think I can foretell the exact circumstances of your death.
What a charming thought.
And what's going to happen?
You were born on the 15th of August, 1882...right?
So they told me.
That is under the sign of Leo,
Libra in the ascendance.
Now you should take the trouble to read the life story of one Gottla Minate and Aurelio Versace
They were born on the same day you were.
Only, a few hundred years ago.
But then they're the same constellation.
Come on, just give me the cold facts.
Well, they both died a death of violence.
Poison? Shooting? Hanging?
No, they were choked to death.
Well, I'm glad to know what to expect.
I hate surprises.
Why don't you go to bed?
Not a good time.
I just wondered...
Abracadabra...here it is!
How did you know about that safe?
When I was a boy, no higher than that, 
Uncle Francis opened it for me.
He pretended it was magic, and I never forgot it.
You know that this house belongs to Julie.
Everything in it is hers.
Everything, do you hear?
I'm not so sure about that.
There's another will in the safe that might change that picture considerably.
Uncle Francis taught me a jingle to remember the combination.
How did it go again?
It escapes me.
Get out of here!
Good night.
Don't work too much.
What is it?
Donald...and the Commissario.
What happened to Donald?
The hand...it tried to strangle him.
The hand?!
I saw it with my own eyes.
What happened to him?
Please help me take him to his room.
He's finally fallen asleep.
I'm holding you responsible, 
Commissario.
Well that would round out the mystery nicely... accusing a Commissario of murder.
You're forcing us to stay here where our lives are in danger.
It's a conspiracy...a device to get rid of us.
Are you accusing anybody in particular?
I'll answer that question the moment I've left this house.
Tomorrow morning I'm going to call an ambulance, and take Don away from here.
I don't think you son can be moved in his condition.
I'll take a chance on that.
And nothing can stop me.
Nothing...neither ghosts nor police.
There's a possibility of brain fever.
It's very dangerous, Mr Arlington.
When I want medical advice, 
I'll call a doctor.
The Devil's haunting this house.
The Devil...
It's in Signor Ingram's hand!
Quickly before it catches up with us.
You're always imagining things...
The night your grandmother died, you heard skeletons rattling.
Well, if you don't believe me, why are you running away?
Well, it can't hurt to be on the safe side.
There they go...
Giovanna, Antonia and Clara.
They're more afraid of ghosts than of the law.
The law doesn't like it too much either.
If I were not the Commissario,
I would be right with them.
I wonder what the Commissario would think of all this packing.
He really can't keep us here for ever, can he?
It depends on the ghost of Francis Ingram.
Oh Bruce...let's get away from here... we're not under arrest.
What can they do if we just disappear?
Nothing...there's a bus that crosses the border at Chiasso.
We can be in Lugarno tomorrow and in Zurich before the Commissario even knows we've left.
Well, let's leave... why do we stay?
Perhaps I'm a bit curious.
Conrad!
Conrad!
What's the matter?
The hand!
Tell me...what is it?
The hand's in the library... the hand, it crawled on my desk.
It picked up the ring...
I saw it with my own eyes.
It's alive.
I tell you, it's alive!
The desk...
What are you talking about?
It's gone...it was in here...
I threw it in here myself!
Although I think of death, 
I don't anticipate it yet.
That's what Mr Ingram said to me at dinner that night.
Isn't this your handwriting, Hilary?
It's Ingram's...his hand wrote it...
Don't you see...the hand...
It must be here!
Find it!...It must be somewhere!
- You must help me find it!
 - Calm down!
You must help me...find it!
There's no hand Hilary...
It's only in your mind.
But I saw it...It  moved.
Listen to me... there's nothing here I tell you.
The note?
YOU must have written it... unknowingly.
- Try to think!
- I couldn't have written it...
I didn't.
Bruce...please take me to my room.
What's he on with down there?
He's a sick man.
Mentally sick.
Have you ever heard him play the piano?
No, not that I can remember.
Are you sure he CAN'T play?
No, but I'm sure only Francis Ingram could have played that thing I wrote for him.
Good night, Julie.
And...don't forget to lock your door.
I caught it...I caught it...
I locked it up.
That's fine.
The horrible hand can't escape any more.
Now it can't get out.
Can't.
Of course it can't...
Now go to bed.
Dad...
Yes?
8 bones has the carpis,
5 the metacarpis...
14 the phalanges...
All in all...27 all in all!
You must lie down, Don, please.
It came back in my sleep.
8 bones has the carpis
Uncle Francis studied medicine once.
He told me the jingle when I was a kid.
They're the number of bones in the hand!
Don't worry, this isn't fever, 
I'm feeling well, I'm alright.
You've got to stay in bed, 
Don...please! it's the combination of the safe downstairs.
Let's open the safe...
Let's open the safe and get the first will!
Why not wait 'til tomorrow?
It may not be there anymore.
Well, you stay here, and I'll go.
What were those numbers again?
See...how can I trust your memory?
Come along Dad...and don't worry, 
I feel great!
It's strange how things you thought you'd forgotten, suddenly come back to you.
I even remember the eau-de-Cologne 
Uncle Francis used.
It was 'Lanvin Verbena'.
One moment, signor.
May I ask what you are doing here,
Signor Raymond, and you Signor Donald? 
I was under the impression you are very ill.
Commissario and his pride of duty. 
You're just in time to see a safe being cracked.
This will send you to prison, 
Signor Donald.
On the contrary, Commissario...
Now you can testify that we took nothing but the will of Francis Ingram.
This unheard of...asking the police to witness an unlawful act.
Suppose somebody were to remove that document tonight...
I don't think you'd care to take that responsibility.
I feel quite sure you'll give us your permission.
Whatever you do is your responsibility...
Go right ahead..
But remember...it is without my permission.
Thanks a lot, Commissario.
Do you remember the combination, dad?
5 bones has the carpis...
No...no...you'll mix me up.
8 bones has the carpis...
5 the metacarpis.
14 the phalanges...
All in all...27...
Abracadabra!
Francis Ingram's hand!
Donald!
Donald...come back!
Signor Conrad...stop him, he's gone mad!
What's the matter?
Why did you run away?
I saw it there in the safe!
But it's dead...
It can't hurt you anymore.
Arlington!
I've found him.
Do you believe me now?
You can see the hand truly exits.
Hilary, 
Listen to me...
I've got something to say to you.
I'm sorry. I'm almost sorry 
I even know.
But I DO know!
What?
It was you who tried to kill Don, wasn't it?
Remember I'm not the beast...
I'm your friend, Hilary.
But I do know you pretended to come from the garden, the night he was attacked.
And I  know it was you who murdered Duprex.
No...
You can talk to me.
I nailed it down so it could not kill again.
It was the hand!
I tell you it was the hand!
That's what you wanted people to believe.
You used it to put fingerprints everywhere.
To prove it was the hand that committed the crime.
You can follow what I'm saying, can't you? 
You're ill, Hilary.  
You can't distinguish any more between what is right and what is wrong.
Between imagination and reality.
Raymond threatened to take your books away.
You'd have done anything to prevent it.
I know how much they meant to you.
Now...now you'll have to face it.
The charge will be murder.
Murder!...I never hurt anybody.
I'm not a murderer.
It was the hand.
You'll have to go to the police and tell them about the hand.
Yes...
And yourself!
You'll have to tell them everything, Hilary.
They'll  put me away...
They'll put me away!
But there's nothing else for you to do.
I'm sure they'll let you take your books with you.
My books?
They'll let me take my books?
Are you sure of that?
I'll do everything I can to help you.
But if they take the house away from you...
Julie...you didn't tell the Commissario, did you?
No, I haven't told anyone.
That's nice of you Julie...
You're sure you didn't tell anyone?
- Anybody?
- Yes.
Not even Conrad?
No....I'm very fond of you Hilary.
I wanted to give you the chance.
Then if I don't?...
Then I'll have to tell the police.
I still have so much work to do.
You're the only one that knows I...
I can't let you stop me!
I can't trust you any longer!
That's Ingram.
He's playing again.
Listen!
The hand...it's playing down there!
The hand...it's Ingram's hand!
There's nobody playing, Hilary.
It's only in your mind.
I know it...
It's not in my mind...
Don't you hear it?
It's bursting my eardrums!
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!
Julie!...
Julie!
Don't leave me alone!
Open the door!
Hilary...listen!..Listen!
Can't you hear it?
The piano...it's the hand playing... it's the hand!
You were right all the time! 
It WAS Ingram's hand that committed murder!!.
I'm your friend, Hilary.
Please save me from the hand...
It wants to kill me!
Please help me!
Destroy it before it kills again!
I'll destroy it!
You see my friend...
I was ill.
It won't hurt you.
Donald and his father ought to be pleased when they find out I've signed over the Villa Francesca to them.
Who's playing?
Do not worry, signorina, it is not the hand!
Look! I found it!
You let the string go...
It stops.
It starts...it stops...
It starts...
Stops.
Come with me, signorina, 
I will show you.
The secret of the ghost, signorina.
Signor Conrad and I...
We discovered it.
A mere record.
After Hilary's death I found a receipt from the Milano Edison Recording Agency...
Indicating that Francis Ingram had made a record of the Bach arrangement.
But I couldn't find a trace of such a recording until I found the hidden gramophone.
And Hilary was of sound mind when he installed this contraption.
Then, after committing one murder, and attempting another...
His brain snapped.
He started to imagine that he was hearing the piano... and seeing the hand.
The hand was always in the safe or in his desk.
All ready?
All except the passports.
Ah! I have them.
All signed and stamped.
I'm going to be very sorry to see you both go.
We're going to miss you too, Ovidio.
You know, I like this place, now that I found there are no ghosts.
It's a good thing I didn't write to HQ in Milano about the ghosts!
I saved myself from ridicule.
That you did, Commissario!
- Arrividerci!
- Goodbye, Commissario.
 Arrividerci, Ovidio.
What is the matter?
The hand!
Silly girl! 
You should know by now there is no such thing as ghosts.
I think I better get out of this house.
Can you imagine anyone believing a hand that can walk around?
How do you like that...
My own hand!

- Good evening, Vercheres.
- Sh!
Oh, good evening, Inspector. You have missed half of the opera, as usual.
- I didn't come to see the opera.
- As usual.
(applause)
- Raoul!
- Christine.
I just got back from Rouen.
No, I must talk to you for a moment.
But I...
Raoul, I shouldn't have left.
Christine, dear,
I hurried over to tell you something.
- What?
- That I love you.
- Again?
- Still.
- What a wonderful audience tonight.
- And you were marvellous, Biancarolli.
We're having supper tonight at the Café de L'Opéra.
- I'm sorry, Raoul, but I can't tonight.
- Why not?
Chris? Christine!
- I'm coming, Jenny.
- If you've another engagement, break it.
You've had your fling at this for two years.
But I don't want to give up the opera, not until I've had a chance to really sing.
Anatole says he has great faith in my voice, and he's going to help me.
Naturally. That's what baritones are for(!)
- You were in wonderful voice tonight.
- Thank you, Marcel.
Christine! Why weren't you on the stage for the end of the act?
- You're all right?
- Oh, yes.
Mademoiselle DuBois, come here please.
Don't worry.
Why weren't you onstage for the curtain calls?
- Well, erm, I was ill...
- No, you were not.
You were entertaining a friend.
A friend, mind you!
For a singer to absent herself from the stage during a performance is a gross breach of...
- Oh. You wish to talk to me, monsieur?
- With your permission,
I'd like a few words with MIle DuBois in my office after the performance.
- Yes, she will be there.
- Thank you.
- Now, you bear in mind what I told you.
- Yes, monsieur.
Terrifying fellow, that Vercheres, when he wants to be.
I'm very grateful, monsieur. I promise you
I'll never miss a curtain call again.
It's a promise. Now, uh, this young man who is more important to you than your career... Who is he?
But he isn't, monsieur. That is,
I am very fond of him. I mean...
Oh.
Well, he's Inspector
Raoul Daubert of the Sûreté.
Inspector? You mean a policeman?
Oh, but he's not an ordinary policeman.
Even an extraordinary policeman seems a strange sweetheart for a soprano.
Does he sing?
I'm afraid you don't understand, monsieur.
He's a graduate of the military academy at Saint-Cyr, and he's very intelligent and very clever.
For a man who means nothing to you, he seems to have made quite an impression.
Oh, but I didn't say he meant nothing to me. What I said was...
I know. I know what you mean.
You have promise, Mademoiselle DuBois, but you must choose between an operatic career and what is usually called "a normal life".
Though why it is so-called is beyond me.
You can't do justice to both.
The artist has a special temperament, and he must live his life exclusively with those who understand it.
I understand, monsieur.
You'll find that music has its compensations, my dear. Good night.
Good night, and thank you.
Oh, mademoiselle, please tell Mr Claudin to come in. He's in the anteroom.
Certainly. Good night.
Good evening. Monsieur Villeneuve asks that you come in now.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle, may I speak to you for a minute?
Certainly.
You weren't on the stage tonight for the third-act curtain calls.
Everyone in the theatre seems to have noticed it. It's really quite flattering.
Why weren't you there?
Oh, forgive me, but I've been here so long that you...
Everybody, everything connected with the Opera is so much a part of my life.
Of course... But Mr Villeneuve is waiting.
Yes.
You weren't ill, were you?
You're not in any trouble?
It's impertinent of me, I know, but, uh...
You're very kind.
Good night.
Uh, Christine!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Good night.
Good night.
- (knocking)
- (Villeneuve) Come in, please.
You know why I sent for you, Claudin?
I think so, Maestro.
For some time now I have sensed discord in the violin section.
It was not until tonight that I definitely located the source of the trouble.
Let me hear you play, if you please, Claudin.
Yes, Maestro.
(# mournful tune)
- What was that, Claudin?
- A little song.
A lullaby, from Provence, where I was born.
You played it very well.
Perhaps I was wrong.
No, it was you.
What's the matter?
You're an accomplished musician.
Come, come, now.
Let me hear you play the opening movement in the third act of Martha. 
It's no use, Maestro. Something has happened to the fingers of my left hand.
- But you played that lullaby perfectly.
- It's a simple melody, Maestro.
That's why I played it.
You were trying to fool me, eh, Claudin?
Well, perhaps it's only temporary.
Perhaps it'll get better.
I hope so, but in the meantime...
You know, Claudin, the aim of the Paris Opera is perfection.
I'm sorry, old fellow, very sorry. You've been with us a long time, haven't you?
20 years.
What am I to do, Maestro?
I know it's hard, Claudin.
No doubt you've saved a tidy little fortune to retire on.
- Yes, of course.
- In appreciation of your long service,
I shall arrange with the directors to have a season ticket issued to you.
Thank you, Maestro.
(knock at door)
(door opens)
Why don't you eat before the opera, instead of keeping me up all hours?
You're rich enough. Same soup, night after night, week after week.
- Please don't disturb yourself, Marie.
- You're a fine one to say that!
Why wouldn't I be disturbed?
I'll come right to the point.
What you do with your money is not my business.
If you want to hoard it and starve, it's your affair.
But you haven't paid me for six weeks, and that's as long as I'm going to wait.
I haven't any money.
If you'll be patient, just a little longer...
You haven't any money? After working for the Paris Opera all these years?
What will you do with your money?
Bury it with you?
If you do, they'll dig you up and steal it.
If you think you can add a few francs to your fortune at my expense, you're very much mistaken.
Marie, you've been very kind, you've been very patient. You'll be paid, I promise you.
Now please leave me alone.
It makes me sick to think of all that money doing nobody any good.
Either I get my money or out you go.
That's my last word, Claudin.
(# sings ascending scale)
(bell tinkles)
You're late, Mr Claudin.
The lesson is almost over.
I didn't come about that today, mademoiselle.
- She's not in voice.
- I'll tell Signor Ferretti.
- Please don't interrupt the lesson.
- Of course not. I understand.
But I must announce the time to Signor
Ferretti, or he'll keep students for hours.
- It's 11 o'clock, Signor Ferretti.
- Thank you.
Mademoiselle, you disappoint me.
I'm sorry. I'm a little upset.
If a man is upsetting you, pitch him out of your life. Music is first.
- Music is everything.
- I understand.
You don't understand. Women never understand. But they are docile.
Perhaps you're not getting enough sleep.
Come later tomorrow, say midday.
Thank you, monsieur.
Remember you have responsibilities to others as well as yourself.
I know.
I can never repay you for what you've done for me.
- Good day, monsieur.
- Good day.
Would you come this way, monsieur?
Monsieur Claudin is here, Signor Ferretti.
Come in, Claudin, come in.
- Won't you sit down a moment?
- Thank you.
I suppose you noticed your protégée was disappointing today?
Well, an off day now and then.
You've done a lot for her, Signor.
Nevertheless, she is making definite progress, eh?
I was dismissed from the orchestra last night.
Oh. Then you will have to withdraw your support for Mademoiselle DuBois?
Only for a little while, just until
I can secure another position.
I had hoped that you would continue to instruct her.
Claudin, if you don't mind me saying so, you are a fool.
A man of your age might win a girl like Christine DuBois if he happened to be the director of an opera company, but a poor violinist...
We agreed never to discuss my motives.
Please, won't you continue to work with her?
Why should I assume your burden, after you spent all your money on her?
She means nothing to me.
But her career means more to me than anything else.
I would never let you lose anything on her account.
I'm sorry, Claudin, really sorry.
If I had time... But my expenses are great.
And you must remember there are many who can pay waiting to study with me.
I'll let her come a few times, and then
I will tell her she no longer needs me.
But that isn't true.
As a matter of fact, if you had the money, she might be launched on a career soon.
I assume that MIle DuBois has not the means to pay for her own instructions?
A month's salary wouldn't be enough to pay for one of your lessons.
But... I have written a concerto.
Will you trust me if I can arrange to have it published?
Every violinist has written a concerto!
Come, come, my dear Claudin.
But I have faith in this one, as much faith as I had in MIle DuBois when I came three years ago.
Now, I was right about her,
Signor, and I'm right about this.
Pleyel and Desjardins will publish it, and they'll give me a substantial advance. You'll see!
(man) It's a shame.
Pleyel's in there with his etchings.
Why don't they tell the poor devil he won't see anyone, instead of torturing him?
Claudin?
He'll see me?
No. He is too busy today.
- Has he seen my manuscript?
- Manuscript? What manuscript?
- My concerto.
- I know nothing about it.
- But you took the portfolio into him.
- If I did, you will receive it in due time.
Now, my dear, the acid. Be careful, or you'll burn yourself horribly.
- Monsieur Pleyel?
- What are you doing here?
- I've been waiting since this morning.
- Weren't you told I couldn't see anyone?
Yes, but my manuscript.
I must find out about my manuscript.
Give this fellow his manuscript, Georgette.
You'll find it on the desk, if it's anywhere.
- What is your name?
- Uh, Claudin. Erique Claudin.
Claudin...
No, it wouldn't be there. It's a large manuscript in a portfolio. It's a concerto.
- I'm sorry, but I don't know where it is.
- But it must be here.
Well, if it is, it will turn up.
You might call again in a few days.
You don't understand. It's my only copy.
It represents two years' work.
- You heard what the lady said.
- But it was brought in.
It must be here. It must be found.
Did we ask you to bring your music to us, Claudin?
I've seen samples of your compositions before.
Perhaps some employee has thrown it into the wastebasket, where it belongs.
Good night!
(# piano playing)
- Do you think I was right, Monsieur Liszt?
- It's magnificent. Tell me his name again.
- Erique Claudin.
- Claudin?
I've tried for years to persuade
Pleyel to publish his work, but you know
Pleyel and unknown composers.
Pleyel will publish this, I promise.
(continues playing piano)
That's my music.
I thought I told you to get out.
Thief!
You've stolen my music.
- Thief!
- (Georgette) Maurice!
- You're choking him!
- You've stolen my music!
Thief! Thief!
- (Pleyel chokes)
- You've stolen my music!
What happened?
- Stop him!
- What's happened?
Monsieur Pleyel's been murdered by that madman, Claudin! Get a doctor, quickly!
You, get a doctor. Call the police!
Get a doctor! Call the police!
Police! Police!
- What happened?
- Monsieur Pleyel has been murdered!
- He ran down that way.
- Come on, let's go!
Not here.
Sorry, monsieur.
Move on, and don't come back into this district tonight.
(howls)
Lecours, how were we ever induced to accept the management of this place?
It's not an opera house. It's a madhouse.
And now this:
"Wanted for murder: Erique Claudin, former violinist at Paris Opera House."
"Age 48 years, height 5ft 8in."
"The face has recently been disfigured by acid."
It's an outrage.
After 20 years with the Paris Opera, this miserable Claudin has the insolence to commit a murder.
After 20 years with the Paris Opera,
- A man is capable of anything, Amiot.
- (knock on door)
Come in, come in, come in!
Monsieur, there is a thief in the opera house.
A costume has been stolen, and two masks.
Impossible. The wardrobe woman must have lost them.
- She should have been dismissed.
- She's too fat.
That's not all. The thief has broken into the restaurant.
- The restaurant?
- Yes, monsieur. There is missing a...
There is missing a bucket of pickled pigs' feet in vinegar, a ham and a pâté.
Call the police. This must be stopped.
Monsieur, I am afraid the police can't stop that. It's he.
Who?
Oh, please don't start that nonsense again, Vercheres.
You ought to know there aren't any ghosts.
Monsieur, you are sceptical, but
I don't like ghosts. I am a busy man.
What's that?
Our brilliant stage manager insists there's a malicious ghost prowling about.
If anything goes wrong, he thinks this ghost did it.
Oh, monsieur...
- It has a long nose and a big, red beard.
- You make me nervous.
It's gone!
Did you hear that, Lecours?
My master key is gone.
Do you realise what that means, Lecours?
With that key in his possession, the thief can open 2500 doors, to say nothing of thousands of closets and cabinets.
Perhaps the pickled pigs' feet will kill him.
Oh, you don't seem to understand.
Why, he can hide everywhere.
The entire police force couldn't find him.
You don't realise the extent of this place.
You've never troubled to find out.
Why should I? I have troubles enough.
- What are you waiting for? Get the police!
- Yes, monsieur.
A pâté, a ham, pickled pigs' feet and 2500 rooms!
What is the Opera coming to?
(# angry chords)
(# "Provence Lullaby")
(# hums the tune)
That's lovely. What is it?
It's a lullaby of Provence.
I've known it all my life.
# Hear those bells ringing soft and low
# Bringing peace through the twilight glow
# According to everyone
# Night has begun
# Turn from your weary toil
# Day's work is done
# Hear them ring while my love and I
# Drift and dream to the lullaby

- Monsieur Daubert.
- Madame.
They call this rehearsing, monsieur.
Well, I'm sorry to intrude, but I must see you, Christine.
- Well, you see I'm busy right now...
- Christine!
Please remember that you are speaking to a gentleman.
Well, uh...
- Come in, Raoul.
- Rehearsals!
Anatole... Well, he's been helping me.
- Monsieur's very kind.
- Not at all, monsieur. I find it a pleasure.
- I'm Anatole Garron of the Opera.
- I'm so sorry.
This is Inspector Daubert, of the Sûreté.
I've heard of you, Inspector.
Your work must be very exciting.
Oh, not so exciting as yours, monsieur.
It doesn't lend itself to self-expression.
I didn't recognise that delightful song you were singing.
But as you know,
I am no connoisseur of the opera.
It's not from an opera, Raoul. It's a lullaby.
A lullaby?
It didn't seem very effective, as a lullaby.
Well, you see, Monsieur Inspector, a song is capable of many interpretations,
- By a musician.
- By a detective, too.
Though no doubt the detective is usually mistaken.
I must see you alone, Christine.
I'm here on business from the Sûreté.
With me?
What business could mademoiselle have with the Sûreté?
What is it, Raoul?
If you don't mind,
I'd rather Anatole stayed.
Very well, Christine.
- You know Erique Claudin?
- Why, yes.
How well?
I knew him only as a violinist in the orchestra.
I encountered him a few times in the foyer or on the stage or outside the Opera, but that's all.
He acted a little strangely, but I assumed he was that way with everybody.
- Strangely?
How do you mean, "strangely"?
Well... I don't know.
He just seemed... eccentric, but harmless.
I thought he was a rather kind old fellow, until I read of the murder.
- What is it, Raoul?
- He was a kind and inoffensive man.
Until he thought Pleyel was stealing his life's work.
Then something snapped, and he became a homicidal maniac.
In his state, he may commit other murders.
It's urgent that we capture him as soon as possible.
But what has all this to do with me?
We found something in his room that connects you with him.
No doubt you can explain.
So that's what became of it!
- Be good enough to explain yourself.
- Certainly. That statuette is mine.
- Yours?
- Definitely. I made it.
- I intended to make you a present of it.
- How nice of you, Anatole.
It disappeared from my dressing room.
It's an extraordinary likeness.
My compliments on your versatility, monsieur.
You must have posed for this many times. Every detail is you.
I never posed for it, not once.
- You did this from drawings?
- And from memory, Monsieur Inspector.
To see Christine is to carry her image in your heart and mind for ever.
- Claudin must have stolen it.
- Why?
Isn't it obvious?
Well, speaking purely as an inspector of the Sûreté, even the obvious often needs confirmation.
But as a man, Mr Daubert, you can understand that sitting there in the orchestra pit night after night and looking at Christine,
Claudin probably fell in love with her.
You admit that is possible, no?
Christine, did Claudin ever seek more than a casual acquaintance with you?
No, never.
Can you imagine so diffident a lover, monsieur? Claudin was barely 50.
Well, no doubt he lacked... assurance.
No doubt.
- This is yours, Christine.
- You're giving it to me?
- Yes.
- Well!
Then I'll accept it as a gift from both of you.
Well, I seem to have got the worst of this bargain.
In the future, Monsieur Inspector,
I detect, you model.
- In any case, that was a bad clue.
- Oh, not so bad as it seems.
It enabled me to recover mademoiselle's statuette.
Thank you, Raoul.
Is that your carriage at the door, monsieur?
Why, yes.
Would you be good enough to give me a lift?
- Where are you going?
- It doesn't matter.
As inspector of police,
I have business all over Paris.
Yes, well, in that case...
- Au revoir,  Christine.
- Au revoir. 
You've been most helpful, Christine.
- I hope you catch him soon.
- Thank you.
- Ready, monsieur?
- At your service.
- After you, monsieur.
- After you,  monsieur.
(laughs)
(orchestra tuning up)
- Madame looks beautiful tonight.
- Don't I always, Yvette?
But especially tonight. Monsieur Garron, if he has eyes in his head...
- (knocking)
- (man) Madame Biancarolli!
Thank you! Madame...
(practises vocal exercises)
Good evening.
Marcel, do you think
I lead an enviable life?
- Yes, monsieur.
- I do, but not for the reasons you think.
I'm a very happy man because I'm having supper tonight with Mademoiselle DuBois.
(Claudin) Christine?
You're going to be a great and famous singer. I'll help you.
(# singing in French)
Marie, Comtesse de Bretonne. 
(# singing in French)
(Garron) Christine, you're going to be a great and famous singer. I'll help you.
- What's the matter?
- Someone just said the same thing to me
- A moment ago, in my room.
- Someone? Who?
I don't know. It was... just a voice.
- I knew you'd hear me sooner or later.
- It was you?
Of course. I don't mean actually, but I've been saying it ever since I saw you and heard you sing. At last you heard me.
- Your cue, monsieur.
- I'll tell you again at supper.
Armand, Duc de Montaigne. 
(applause)
What is it, madame?
I don't know. I...
Help me!
Monsieur Vercheres!
Oh, madame!
You, get a doctor, quickly.
Take her to her dressing room.
- What could have happened?
- What?
Ohh!
MIle DuBois, you must go on at once.
Madame Biancarolli has been taken ill.
Please get changed quickly. Claire!
Where is that clumsy wardrobe woman?
Claire, get MIle DuBois changed at once.
There isn't a moment to lose.
She was drugged, there's no doubt.
- Who the devil would want to drug her?
- I'm sure she overate.
- You're certain she'll recover, Dr Lefours?
- Definitely.
What am I doing here?  I...
I should be onstage. I...
- Doctor!
- Madame...
She'll be all right now.
Camarades, I'empereur nous appelle. 
(# Christine sings)
Why is she singing?
What is she doing out there?
- What's happened?
- Madame, control yourself.
- I assure you...
- Come to the point, Amiot.
You were seized with a touch of indigestion.
As your understudy,
MIle DuBois took your place.
A touch of indigestion! Why, I was perfectly well when I went on the stage.
Why, I was drugged!
And you all know by whom.
Anatole Garron did it to make room for that baggage!
- Madame, consider what you're saying,
- Madame, please compose yourself.
I demand Garron's arrest.
And hers too. She had a hand in it.
I demand an investigation!
- Let me go!
- Madame, consider our position.
You were wonderful!
(cheering)
I assure you, monsieur. The property man swears that there was no opportunity for any human being to tamper with the drink.
Monsieur Inspector, what are you waiting for?
I demand the arrest of Anatole Garron.
You know he did it.
I know nothing of the sort, madame.
I am a police officer, not a psychic.
It is my duty to collect evidence, without prejudice.
Haven't you evidence enough?
Everyone knows...
Madame!
Will you be seated, please?
Mr Garron, you had the opportunity to put the drug in Madame Biancarolli's glass.
Certainly, Monsieur Inspector.
We all did.
- It becomes, then, a question of motive.
- The motive is very simple, monsieur.
He wanted to get me out of the way so he could make room for that...
- Are you referring to MIle DuBois?
- I am.
You heard, Monsieur Garron.
Madame is in good voice... and most explicit.
Have you anything to say, monsieur?
I deny madame's accusation.
Do you deny, monsieur, that you had any motive in drugging madame?
I deny that I drugged her.
I don't understand your reluctance to make the arrest, Inspector.
- You're not an examining magistrate.
- Can you substantiate that Mr Garron had a motive, and that the motive was MIle DuBois?
- Anyone with half an eye could tell you...
- Hearsay is not evidence, madame.
I'll go over your head, Monsieur Daubert.
I have influence at the Sûreté.
I was drugged tonight to the point of death.
I insist upon the arrest of the criminal and his accomplice.
- And if you don't, I...
- One moment, madame, please.
You have heard Mr Garron deny that he drugged you.
As the inspector says, there is no evidence.
- And remember, madame...
- Are you suggesting that I...
If you insist upon his arrest and fail to obtain a conviction, you will find yourself in a very difficult predicament.
- Quite right.
- And no matter what the outcome, don't forget that your career is bound to the Paris Opera.
Whatever scandal injures us, or any member of the company,
- Will injure you as well.
- (Lecours) Precisely.
Are you suggesting that
I forget the whole affair?
Yes. For your own sake, as well as ours, and purely as a matter of business expediency.
That is exactly what we propose, madame.
(Lecours) Exactly.
Very well.
That is, under certain conditions.
I want a new understudy.
Christine DuBois goes back to the chorus and stays there for the two years my contract has to run.
I won't permit such an outrage!
If any such arrangement is made, I'II...
- Now, madame...
- My dear Anatole, I have not finished.
You suggest I forget
I was drugged tonight?
- Madame.
- Very well. I'll go a step further.
I suggest that you forget anything happened afterwards.
- For once, madame, I do not understand.
- Oh, monsieur, it's so simple.
Nothing happened tonight. I wasn't drugged and Christine DuBois didn't sing.
- But...
- There are always critics in the house.
You'll send word to the papers that no mention of her is to be made.
You'll do nothing of the sort.
It's ridiculous.
Besides, what about the public, madame?
Shall we send word to the public to forget that MIle DuBois was a sensation?
If you're willing to ruin the Opera for the sake of Christine DuBois, it's your affair.
But you'll either do as I say, or I'll charge both of them with trying to murder me.
Do you understand that? Murder me!
- Madame was magnificent tonight.
- I was good, wasn't I?
Monsieur Garron must be biting his nails.
Ah, let him. He'll come crawling back to me on his hands and knees, confessing the whole thing and begging my forgiveness.
Madame!
Who are you?
Christine DuBois will sing tomorrow night.
Leave Paris. This is your last warning.
Take off that prop-room mask.
(screaming)
- What was that?
- I don't know.
- (man) Something must have happened.
- Silence, please.
- (woman) What happened?
- Sh! Monsieur?
Madame Biancarolli and her maid have been murdered.
Murdered?!
- Are you hurt, monsieur?
- What happened? What were you doing?
- I was chasing him.
- Chasing whom?
The murderer, of course.
There was someone else up there?
Certainly. Everyone must have seen...
You saw him yourself, didn't you?
No, monsieur. I was chasing you. 
How long will the Opera remain closed, Inspector?
- Yes, how long?
- I do not know.
- Any suspects?
- Yes, whom do you suspect?
- No one.
- What is your theory on the motive?
I am not a theorist. All I can say is that as long as the opera house remains closed, everyone in Paris, in all France, will think only of the murder, hounding us to make an arrest.
Inspector Daubert.
I came directly I got your message.
What has happened now?
Listen to this, monsieur.
"Christine DuBois must replace
Biancarolli, who ignored my warning."
I found this mysteriously placed on my desk after we got back from supper.
There is an excellent suggestion in this, monsieur. You must reopen the Opera.
- But your orders...
- Are countermanded. Reopen.
- With MIle DuBois, monsieur?
- Of course! It should pacify this madman.
If he doesn't harm anybody, his being in the building doesn't matter.
- Christine DuBois must not sing.
- What?
And the murderer must not remain in the building.
- It is my duty to apprehend him.
- I don't understand.
If Christine DuBois sings, that will satisfy the murderer, and he may never appear.
To lure him from his hiding place, someone else must sing.
Are you suggesting we reopen the Opera with a murder as an added attraction?
- Please, Lecours...
- I'll post police throughout the building.
Even with the chorus onstage, with a bodyguard for the singer.
- But, monsieur, our reputation...
- I am reluctant to do this, monsieur.
Particularly on MIle DuBois' account, but I can see no other way.
And whom do you suggest as "bait",
Monsieur Inspector?
Whomever you decide.
Madame Lorenzi.
She has nerve, that woman.
- Too much.
- Very well, then.
- The Opera will reopen.
- Yes, monsieur.
(bell)
- Oh.
- (both) Good morning, Christine.
- Good morning.
- (both) May I come in, Christine?
Yes, do.
- Well?
- (both) Christine, I...
- Yes?
- (both) If I might have a word...?
- Well, what is it?
- After you, monsieur.
- (both) Christine, I...
- Well, now, one at a time, please!
You first, Anatole, as your name begins with an A.
They're going to reopen the Opera.
At last we will sing...
You are wrong, monsieur.
I'm sorry, Christine.
They are going to reopen the Opera, but without you.
Circumstances connected with the murder demand that someone else sing the leading role.
- But Anatole...
- You may like to know, monsieur, that circumstances connected with the murder demand that she does sing.
Really? I am aware that your profession requires a certain self-assurance,
- But aren't you going too far?
- Not at all.
I have a plan for apprehending the murderer.
- So you have turned detective, monsieur?
- I have.
Very well, if it amuses you, but I advise you to confine your hobby to the entertainment of your friends.
Well, let's not waste words, monsieur.
I've been assured by
Messrs Amiot and Lecours that as soon as the Opera reopens,
MIle DuBois will sing.
And I might add that my plan is strictly confidential.
I'm sorry, but in my official capacity
I ordered Messrs Amiot and Lecours not to permit you to sing.
- But Raoul...
- At least, not for the present.
And I am not in the least interested in your plan.
May I have a word with you alone?
That's what I came for.
May I speak to you alone?
- But... I'm going out.
- (both) My carriage is outside.
Well, I'm not going right now.
I mean... I'm going later.
(both) I'll wait.
Mr Villeneuve suggested you'd perform this service in the cause of justice.
Do you think Claudin would be tempted to leave his hiding place and risk his life merely to hear his own concerto?
Played by Franz Liszt himself?
Do you doubt it, Maestro?
So many crimes have been committed in the name of music.
It seems only fair to use it now to avert one.
- I am at your service, monsieur.
- Thank you, Maestro. Thank you.
Most exciting, this detective work, most exciting.
It's more than exciting to me. I had the honour of being suspected of the crime.
Monsieur Daubert, please.
- Listen, monsieur.
- Another note.
How this phantom knows everything is beyond me.
"If Madame Lorenzi sings, you are responsible for what happens."
Our plan is working.
I don't like it, monsieur. What will become of the Paris Opera? Police everywhere!
- How is Madame Lorenzi?
- Oh, she's enjoying it.
- Nothing would keep her from singing.
- Well, you know how opera singers are.
With your matron in her dressing room and that fellow of yours waiting to escort her to the stage, she feels quite important.
Madame Lorenzi,
I trust you are entirely composed?
Composed?
What are you talking about? Why not?
- Maestro!
- The piano has been tuned, Maestro.
- When do we introduce the concerto?
- Probably after the opera.
Inspector Daubert has a plan of his own, and we must give it every chance.
You may enjoy seeing the opera from the orchestra pit.
I'll be quite comfortable here.
I can look through the score.
- Excuse me. The overture.
- Thank you again, Maestro.
Remain onstage throughout the performance.
Make yourselves inconspicuous, and be on the alert for anything suspicious.
The only persons backstage are the members of the opera company, all of whom you know. Now, that is all.
(# overture begins)
Christine, I'd rather you'd stayed at home.
You understand why
I asked them not to let you sing?
But I couldn't stay away.
We're introducing a new opera
- And Madame Lorenzi's a great artist...
- And Anatole Garron is the baritone!
I'm sorry, Christine, but I'm concerned about what may happen tonight.
I know. I am too.
Wait for me, please, in your dressing room.
(# singing in Russian)
Sorry.
He's here, Gerard. He murdered one of our men and stole his cape.
He's probably wearing a mask.
Watch everyone closely.
Of course, monsieur.
Sorry.
(# singing in Russian)
(# sings in Russian)
(# Madame Lorenzi sings)
(screams)
(screaming and shouting)
What is it?
Come with me, mademoiselle.
Are you one of the police?
- Where is Inspector Daubert?
- Investigating the accident.
I will look after you.
- You're not one of the police.
- I'll watch over you.
- I've always watched over you. Come.
- (screams)
- (screams)
- Sh!
Shh.
You'll stay here with me, my child, won't you?
It's been so Ionely without you, but you've come to me at last, haven't you?
Now you'll sing for me, and I'll play, and we'll be together for ever.
It's beautiful down there.
Beautiful.
Come now, my little one.
Christine!
- Where's Christine?
- I don't know. Isn't it horrible?
- Hasn't she been here?
- I haven't seen her.
There. You're not frightened now, are you?
You know I'll not harm you, don't you?
How could I harm you?
I've always helped you, haven't I?
- Yes.
- Yes what?
Yes, you've always helped me.
Of course I have. Biancarolli knows.
She wouldn't let you sing.
She didn't know how much I love you.
Now she knows.
But it doesn't matter now. Nothing matters except you and me, Christine.
Now you'll sing all you want... but only for me.
You will, won't you, my darling?
Of course.
There's a piano in the Opera foyer.
Let's go there.
You play and I'll sing for you.
But you don't understand.
We can't go back there... ever.
It was I who made the chandelier fall. l, for you, Christine.
But I warned them. I said there'd be death and destruction if they didn't let you sing.
Come.
See? Didn't I tell you it was beautiful?
You didn't know we had a lake all to ourselves, did you?
They've poisoned your mind against me.
That's why you're afraid.
Look at your lake, Christine. You'll love it here, when you get used to the dark.
And you'll love the dark too.
It's friendly and peaceful.
It brings rest, and relief from pain.
It's right under the Opera. The music comes down and the darkness distils it, cleanses it of the suffering that made it, then it's all beauty.
And life here is like a resurrection.
This is more than just a performance of a new concerto.
The future of the Paris Opera may depend upon it.
- Garron, have you seen Christine?
- No, she's at home.
She came to the opera house earlier this evening. Now she's disappeared.
Play, Maestro. Play.
Christine? Christine!
Christine! Christine!
Christine!
George, you two search that passageway.
Gerard, go that way.
Be careful.
This madman may do anything now.
Christine!
Christine!
(# Claudin's concerto begins)
My concerto!
(# plays along with concerto)
Liszt is playing.
That was a brilliant idea of yours, Garron.
Claudin may be up there now, listening.
That sounds in front of us.
It is in front of us.
The whole place is ready to crumble.
Sing, Christine.
Sing!
Don't move.
- The whole place is caving in.
- The shots must have started it.
He called that his concerto, and yet it's written around the melody of my song.
- Who was he?
- He came from your district, in Provence.
Everybody there must have known that old folk song.
He was almost a stranger to me, and yet... somehow I always felt drawn to him with a kind of pity, understanding.
His suffering and madness will be forgotten.
His music, his concerto, will remain.
I'm glad he heard it, before he...
Poor Claudin.
Oh, mademoiselle, you were magnificent tonight!
Thank you, Celeste. I was good, wasn't I?
Oh, wonderful!
- (knock on door)
- Celeste!
Monsieur.
You were magnificent, Christine!
- Incomparable, beautiful-a sensation!
- Is that all?
I've just begun. It would take days and years to tell you how superb you were.
We're having supper tonight at the Café de L'Opéra.
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
Anatole, but I can't tonight.
Why not? Have you another engagement?
- Yes.
- With whom?
With Raoul.
- That policeman?
- (knock at door)
- Come in.
- Christine!
- Oh.
- Oh.
(both) Christine...
- You two know each other, of course.
- (both) Of course.
How soon will you be ready?
The carriage is waiting.
- I know Monsieur Garron will excuse us.
- Anatole has just asked me to supper too.
No doubt. You won't be long, will you, Christine?
I have an idea. Why can't we three have supper together? It's all ordered, isn't it?
I am not in the habit of taking baritones to supper.
And I do not care to be seen in public with the police.
Christine, you'll have to make up your mind finally between us.
Precisely.
(Vercheres)
Don't push, monsieur! Oh, no, no.
- Excuse... Mademoiselle...
- Excuse me.
Don't push, monsieur, please!
Will you join me for a bit of supper at the Café de L'Opéra?
With pleasure, monsieur.
Think we can get through this crowd?
Certainly. After all, who'd pay any attention to a baritone and a detective?
Quite right.
- After you, monsieur.
- After you,  monsieur.
Lord Henry Wotton had set himself early in life to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.
He lived only for pleasure, but his greatest pleasure was to observe the emotions of his friends while experiencing none of his own.
He diverted himself by exercising a subtle influence on the lives of others.
18, I think you said, sir.
Shall I wait, sir?
Yes.
Among Lord Henry's friends was the painter Basil Hallward.
He had been strangely secretive about his latest painting, and Lord Henry, sensing a mystery, determined to discover what it was that his friend wished to conceal.
Hello.
I'm sorry, milord.
Mr. Hallward is not at home.
Mr. Hallward doesn't wish to be disturbed.
It's your best work,
Basil.
Of course,
I can't believe anybody's really as handsome as that portrait.
Who is he?
Why are you being so secretive about it?
You ought to send it to the grosvenor.
I shall not send it anywhere.
I've put too much of myself into it.
Ha ha ha!
I knew you'd laugh, but it's true.
There isn't any resemblance between you and this adonis.
You have an intellectual expression, and intellect destroys the beauty of any face.
Don't flatter yourself.
You're not the least like him.
Of course I'm not, and I'm glad of it.
The wisdom of buddha.
Why are you glad you're not like him?
We suffer for what the gods give us, and I'm afraid
Dorian Gray will pay for his good looks.
Is that his name?
Yes. I didn't intend to tell you.
If I'm to keep visiting you,
I'll have to send you good sherry.
Why didn't you intend to tell me his name?
As I've grown older,
I've come to love secrecy.
I suppose that sounds foolish to you.
Come into the garden.
It doesn't sound foolish.
You forget that I'm married.
The one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary to both parties.
I believe you're a good husband but that you're ashamed of your own virtues.
Your cynicism is simply a pose.
Being natural is simply a pose- the most irritating pose I know.
Tell me the real reason you won't exhibit the picture.
There's little to tell, harry.
Besides, you won't believe it.
I'll believe anything, provided it's quite incredible.
I'm afraid this will seem so.
There's something
I can't quite understand, something mystic about it.
Mystic?
I can't explain it, but whenever Dorian poses for me, it seems as if a power outside myself were guiding my hand.
It's as if the painting had a life of its own, independent of me.
That's why I won't exhibit it.
It belongs to Dorian Gray, and I shall give it to him.
I want to meet him.
We shall be friends.
I always choose my friends for their good looks and my enemies for their good intellects.
I despise your principles, but I enjoy the way you express them.
I like persons better than principles and persons with no principles better than anything else.
I remember where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.
Where was it?
Don't look startled.
It was at my aunt agatha's.
She said she'd discovered a wonderful young man to help her with her charities, and his name was
Dorian Gray.
I pictured somebody with spectacles tramping about on huge feet, so I avoided meeting him.
That's a very common butterfly, Basil- limenitis sevilla.
Hardly belongs in a gentleman's garden.
I'm glad you didn't meet Dorian Gray.
I don't
## want you to meet him.
Who's that at your piano, Basil?
You've come early today, Dorian.
Have i?
You must lend me these pieces.
That depends on how you sit today.
I thought the picture would be finished today.
It will be.
Please go on, mr. Gray.
This is Lord Henry Wotton, an old oxford friend.
My aunt has spoken to me about you.
You're one of her favorites.
You shouldn't go in for philanthropy.
Harry, would you mind if I asked you to go?
Am I to go, mr. Gray?
Stay and explain about philanthropy.
Basil, you've said you liked your sitters to have someone to chat to.
Sit down, then, harry.
Dorian, get on the platform and don't pay attention to Lord Henry.
He has a bad influence over his friends, with the exception of myself.
Have you really a bad influence?
There's no such thing as a good influence.
All influence is immoral.
Why?
Because the aim of life is self-development, to realize one's nature perfectly.
That's what we're here for.
A man should live out his life fully and completely, give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream.
Every impulse that we suppress broods in the mind and poisons us.
There's one way to get rid of a temptation, and that's to yield to it.
Resist it, and the soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself.
There's nothing that can cure the soul but the senses, just there's nothing that can cure the senses but the soul.
Turn left, Dorian.
The gods have been good to you, mr. Gray.
Why do you say that?
You have youth, the one thing worth having.
I don't feel that,
Lord Henry.
Someday you'll feel it terribly.
What the gods give, they quickly take away.
Time is jealous of you.
Don't squander the gold of your days.
Live! Let nothing be lost upon you.
Be afraid of nothing.
Your youth will last such a little time, and you can never get it back.
As we grow older, our memories are haunted by the exquisite temptations we hadn't the courage to yield to.
The world is yours for a season.
It would be tragic if you realized too late, as so many others do, that there's only one thing in the world worth having, and that is youth.
Dorian gray had never heard the praise of folly so eloquently expressed.
The creed of pleasure soared into a philosophy of life while Dorian stood as if he were under a spell.
He felt afraid of Lord Henry's ideas and ashamed of himself for being afraid.
It was as if he were learning to know himself for the first time, as if a stranger had revealed his own secret thoughts to him.
For the first time, he became conscious of his youth and of the fact that one day he would lose it.
My visit hasn't been wasted.
I found a rare and beautiful butterfly.
It's very unusual.
Don't you think it's beautiful, mr. Gray?
Yes, Lord Henry.
Sit down, Dorian.
I'm glad you met
Lord Henry after all.
Are you glad, mr. Gray?
I'm glad now.
I wonder if
I shall always be glad.
Always? That's a dreadful word.
Women are so fond it.
They spoil romance by trying to make it last forever.
The only difference between caprice and lifelong passion is that caprice lasts a little longer.
I believe our hostess has appeared.
You're just in time, darling, to watch me sign
Dorian's painting.
Can I sign it, too?
I think you're entitled to, since you haven't missed a sitting.
"G" for "Gladys."
Which do you prefer, Gladys-
Dorian Gray or his picture?
I like Dorian.
You prefer him today, but when you're a young lady, you may prefer the portrait.
It will look as it does today, but we shall be changed- your uncle and i and even Dorian.
Dorian won't change.
Dorian will stay just as he is till I'm grown.
Won't you, Dorian?
Of course I shall, darling.
You must say good-bye, precious.
Nanny's waiting.
Come along.
Hurry. On your way.
What about me, young lady?
Has Dorian Gray stolen you from me completely?
Good-bye,
Lord Henry.
When this is known,
I shall be torn to shreds in every drawing room.
Shouldn't a gentleman remove his hat in the presence of a lady, parker?
Ha ha!
I never take off my hat except when
I'm out of doors.
She'll be as lovely as your sister was, Basil.
Yes.
But I'm afraid Dorian has stolen her heart from me, too.
I must congratulate you, Basil.
Look at yourself, mr. Gray.
As I grow old, this picture will remain always young.
If it were only the other way... if it were I who would always be young and the picture that would grow old.
That would be hard lines on your work, Basil.
I should object strongly.
You oughtn't to express such a wish around that cat.
It's an egyptian god, and it's quite capable of granting your wish.
Lord Henry is right.
When one loses one's youth, one loses everything.
Perhaps a cup of tea will bring you around, Dorian.
You will have some too, harry- or do you object to simple pleasures?
I adore simple pleasures.
They're the last refuge of the complex.
It's more than a painting.
It's part of myself.
As soon as you're varnished and framed, you'll be sent home.
Do whatever you like with yourself.
Send the egyptian cat.
The god and the picture shouldn't be separated.
If Dorian wants it.
If only the picture could change and I could be always what I am now.
For that, I would give everything.
There's nothing in the whole world
I would not give.
I would give my soul for that.
Dorian began to venture alone on warm summer evenings into surroundings which were strange to him.
Filled with curiosity about places and people remote from his own experience, he wandered to the haugh world of London, the words of Lord Henry vibrating in his mind.
"Live! Let nothing be lost upon you.
Be afraid of nothing."
The two turtles is honored by the visit of a gentleman.
If you please, sir.
I give you the sweetheart of the two turtles, our own sibyl vane.
The snow was very plentiful and crumbs were very few when a weather-beaten sparrow through a mansion window flew her eye fell on a golden cage a sweet love song she heard sung by a pet canary there a handsome yellow bird he said to her, miss sparrow
I've been struck by cupid's arrow will you share my cage with me?
She looked up at his castle with its ribbon and its tassel and in plaintive tones said she good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd rather brave the cold on a leafless tree than a prisoner be in a cage of gold
I'd gladly introduce you, sir, but she's proud.
She won't meet anybody.
Come, my delightful dove!
Descend and make a pilgrimage with me among these mortals.
The spoiled and petted yellow bird could scarce believe it true that a common sparrow should refuse a bird with blood so blue he told her the advantages of riches and of gold she answered that her liberty for gold could not be sold she said,
I must be going but he cried, no, no, it's snowing and the wintry windstorm blows stay with me, my little deary for without you,
'twould be dreary but she only sighed, ah, no good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd gladly mate with you
I love you, little yellow bird but I love my freedom, too so, good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd rather brave the cold on a leafless tree than a prisoner be in a cage of gold she's taken with you, sir.
Say the word, and I'll take you backstage.
Thank you, no.
Night after night,
Dorian went to the two turtles to watch sibyl vane.
A patron of the arts, mrs. Vane.
He's come each evening for a fortnight.
He greatly admires your daughter.
If you will permit me,
I have a request.
You're very kind, sir.
Miss vane, will you sing the little yellow bird for me... now?
She will, sir- gladly.
There's no one to play.
Everyone's gone.
I think I might manage the accompaniment.
You will, won't you, deary?
Yes... on one condition.
Please.
I apologize for my daughter.
So good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd rather brave the cold on a leafless tree than a prisoner be in a cage of gold it's wonderful.
Did... did you write it?
Frederic chopin... for a woman he loved.
Her name was george sand.
Someday I'll tell you about it.
I should like that.
What did the music mean to you?
I don't know.
It is full of emotion, but it's not happy.
No, it's not happy.
Why was he unhappy?
Perhaps because he felt his youth slipping away from him.
What an odd thing for you to say.
Why?
You're so young.
Yes... and you also.
What is the music called?
Has it a name?
A kind of name.
It is called prelude.
Is this how you watch over sibyl, mother?
James, your sister-
I wish I wasn't going to australia.
If only my articles hadn't been signed.
I want sibyl to make a brilliant marriage.
Actresses often marry into upper classes.
Who is this young dandy?
I don't know, but he's rich.
What's his name, sibyl?
What are his intentions?
I don't know his intentions, but I know his name- sir tristan.
You don't know his name, yet you permitted him to... you ought not to have permitted such familiarity.
He is good.
There is no evil in him.
Did you see his face?
No, but I wish
I had, because if he ever does you wrong, I'll kill him.
You're foolish, jim.
You talk like the melodramas mother used to act in.
I received a great deal of gratifying attention in those days.
Mother, watch over sibyl while I'm gone.
##Jim.
You're going away tonight.
The ship will take you far away over the dark waters.
Don't let me remember you angry and troubled.
That's better.
Can't you read what people are in their faces?
You think I'm silly when I call him sir tristan, but to me he's like one of king arthur's knights who took the vow of chivalry to battle against all evildoers, to defend the right, to protect all women, to be true in friendship and faithful in love.
I've never heard a sweeter warbler.
Little yellow bird.
Late as usual, harry.
Forgive me, aunt agatha.
Punctuality is the thief of time, harry says.
Victoria, darling.
I love coming to your house, aunt agatha.
It's one of the few places
I'm likely to meet my husband.
Oh. I'm always dropping it.
Mr. Gray has something to tell you.
We're dying to learn what it is.
It can wait until luncheon is over.
Harry, why do you want mr. Gray to give up the east end?
He's a wonderful musician.
They love his playing.
The east end is a very important problem.
It's the problem of slavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.
I suspect, Lord Henry, we're interested in the poor to amuse ourselves, especially as we grow older and are unfit for other amusements.
Tell me how to become young again.
Can you remember any great errors you committed in your youth, duchess?
A great many.
To regain one's youth, one must repeat one's follies.
A dangerous theory.
One of life's secrets.
Most people die of creeping common sense and discover too late that one never regrets one's mistakes.
One pays a terrible price.
We're overcharged for everything.
One pays in other ways than money.
What sort of ways, sir thomas?
I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in the consciousness of degradation.
No civilized man regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man knows what a pleasure is.
I know what pleasure is- it's to adore someone.
I think I can guess what you have to tell me.
Adoring someone is better than being adored.
Women treat us like humanity treats its gods.
They worship us and keep bothering us to do something for them.
Harry, you're incorrigible.
Women give men the very gold of their lives.
But they invariably want it back in small change.
Women inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and prevent us from carrying them out.
I don't understand you.
You seem to know us women awfully well.
I'm analyzing women at present.
The subject is less difficult than I believed.
Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.
These views are horrifying, lady agatha!
I did not expect to hear the devil's advocate at your table.
I apologize for my intelligent remarks.
I'd forgotten you were a member of parliament.
You will forgive me if I leave at once.
Before the quail- the first of the season?
I ordered them especially for you.
Surely not before the quail, sir thomas.
Think with the liberals and eat with the tories.
How men argue!
I never know what they're talking about.
Do sit, sir thomas.
Lord Henry's ideas are demoralizing and delightful.
They're not to be taken seriously.
I confess.
I never could resist lady agatha's quail.
What have you to tell me?
From what you said, my guess is you've fallen in love.
I'm engaged to be married.
Where are we going, harry?
Grosvenor square, number 7.
It's Dorian we're going to see?
We'll pick him up, then see his fiancee.
Dorian, engaged?
To whom?
To an actress in a cheap vaudeville.
With dyed hair and a painted face.
Don't run down such things.
There's extraordinary charm in them.
Surely you can't be serious.
I hope I shall never be more serious.
You can't possibly approve.
I never approve or disapprove of anything.
Dorian proposes to marry a girl.
Every experience is of value, and marriage is certainly an experience.
Dorian will make this girl his wife and six months later become infatuated with someone else.
He could be so unfaithful?
Faithfulness is merely laziness.
Number 7, sir.
I've been watching for you.
Go to lower euston road, number 22.
Lower euston road, sir?
Lower euston road.
They're always surprised when I give that address.
Hurry!
I want you to meet her before she sings.
I hope you'll always be this happy, Dorian.
Thank you, Basil.
Our engagement's still a secret.
What will your guardian say?
He's sure to be furious, but there's nothing he can do.
When did you mention marriage?
I didn't make any formal proposal.
I said I loved her.
She said she was not worthy to be my wife.
Women are wonderfully practical.
In situations like that, we forget to mention marriage.
They always remind us.
Sibyl has made me forget your poisonous theories- theories about life, about pleasure.
Only pleasure is worth having a theory about.
It's nature's sign of approval.
When we're happy, we're good.
When we're good, we're not always happy.
Sibyl is the answer to your cynicism.
You'll understand when you see her.
So, good-bye little yellow bird
I'd rather brave the cold on a leafless tree than a prisoner be in a cage of gold this marriage is quite right.
The moment we met her,
I was convinced.
She's charming and innocent- transparently so.
I knew you would say that.
She's all that, but I don't agree with Basil.
She loves you so much, you have no need to marry her.
What wickedness are you contemplating?
I should be angry, harry, but I'm too happy.
Sibyl is sacred.
Only sacred things are worth touching.
I begin to find you disgusting.
Don't listen to him, Dorian.
Don't worry, Basil.
I'm immune to his ideas.
Then I needn't tell you how I'd proceed.
What would you do, harry?
I should invite her to my house to see
Basil's portrait.
I'd ask her not to leave.
She'd be shocked.
I'd pretend to be disappointed.
If she still wished to go, I'd become cold, ask her to let herself out, saying I couldn't bear sad farewells or something.
If she left, I'd believe her to be as good as she is beautiful and marry her.
I've always thought your wickedness supposed.
I know better now.
You're an unmitigated cad.
Will you try my experiment, Dorian?
Miss vane, has sir tristan- as you've charmingly called him- ever invited you to see the portrait
Basil Hallward has made of him?
No. I should love to see it. May i?
Of course, darling- tonight, if you wish.
I shall always remember this room just as it is now... the lamplight, you at the piano, my own happiness.
Your clock thinks it's time for me to go.
Clocks can't help being disagreeable.
They think it's their duty.
It's that cat.
I thought I saw its eyes move.
Perhaps you did.
Lord Henry says it's one of the 73 great gods of egypt.
Doesn't it frighten you?
It does, a little.
Listen to this.
"Dawn follows dawn, and nights grow old,
"and all the while, this curious cat
"lies crouching on the chinese mat
"with eyes of satin rimmed with gold.
"Get hence, you loathsome mystery.
"Hideous animal, get hence.
"You wake in me each bestial sense.
"You make me what
I would not be.
"You make my creed a barren sham.
"You wake foul dreams... of sensual life."
What a strange poem.
Who wrote it?
A brilliant young irishman out of oxford.
His name is oscar wilde.
Why do you look at me so strangely?
What would you do, sibyl, if I should say to you, don't leave me now, don't go home?
What would you do, sibyl?
I suppose I should have expected a conventional reaction.
Good night, then.
Good night.
You don't mind letting yourself out, do you?
I can't bear sad farewells.
A wise friend warned me that your innocence, upon which
I would have staked my life, would fail to meet the test I set before you.
I called his wisdom cynicism.
Now I know better.
You've killed my love.
You have been false to the ideal
I'd formed of you.
You used to stir my imagination.
Now you are nothing to me.
I will never see you again or mention your name or think of you.
Henceforth, I shall live only for pleasure.
Everything else is meaningless, and if this leads me to the destruction of my soul, only you are responsible.
Do not try to see me.
I shall leave england and not return for a long time.
I'm sending with this letter a gift of money which will compensate you for any disappointment you may feel.
I have been living in a land of illusions.
Now I shall make an end of the dreams.
My real life begins- my own life, in which you cannot possibly have any part.
Five minutes, miss vane.
In spite of himself,
Dorian was troubled by what he had done.
His uneasy conscience made him avoid those he knew.
All night, he had wandered alone through the dimly lit streets and evil-looking houses of the London haugh world.
When at last he returned to his silent, shuttered house in mayfair, he could not overcome a sense of something... ominous impending.
His eye fell on the portrait
Basil Hallward had painted of him.
In the dim, shaded light, the face appeared to him to be a little... changed.
The expression looked somehow different.
One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth.
It was very strange.
There was no doubt that the whole expression had altered.
The lines of cruelty about the mouth were unmistakable.
There was no such expression on## his ## face.
If only the picture could change and I could be always as I am now.
For that, I would give everything.
There's nothing in the whole world
I would not give.
I would give my soul for that.
But surely his wish had not been fulfilled.
Such things were impossible.
It was monstrous even to think of it.
What if someone else observed the horrible change- his valet, perhaps?
What if Basil Hallward asked to look at his own picture?
But he was being ridiculous.
This was a mere hallucination- an illusion brought on by his troubled senses.
The picture had not changed.
He was mad to think so.
A painted canvas could not alter.
He would look at it again after he had slept, when he was calmer, and he would laugh at this fantastic idea.
But in the afternoon when he returned to examine the portrait again, fantastic as the idea was, his memory of that cruel look was disturbingly vivid.
It was true.
The expression had altered.
There was no doubt of it.
It was incredible, and yet, it was a fact.
Was this portrait to become for him the emblem of his own conscience?
Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?
But if this painting was to be his conscience made visible, he would let it instruct him.
He would give it no reason to reproach him.
He would live purely and nobly.
He had been cruel to sibyl vane, but he could make that right.
She could still be his wife.
He would marry her.
They could be happy together.
He implored her forgiveness.
He blamed himself.
He gave way to the luxury of self-reproach.
When he finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.
Dorian, let me in. I must see you.
Open the door, Dorian.
I'll not go away until I see you.
Dorian, let me in!
You shouldn't lock yourself in.
I'm sorry for it all.
You mean about sibyl vane.
Yes, of course.
It's all right.
I'm grateful to you.
I've learned to know myself better.
From now on, I'll do what my conscience bids me.
What on earth are you talking about?
I'm going to marry sibyl vane.
You're going to say something cynical about marriage.
Don't say it.
I asked sibyl to marry me.
I won't break my word.
Then you don't know.
Know what?
Haven't you read the morning paper?
No, I haven't.
What is it, harry?
What's happened?
Sibyl vane is dead.
That's why I hurried here to see you.
I wanted to see you first.
I assumed you knew.
Don't get mixed up in the inquest.
They don't know your name at the theater.
Did sibyl... tell me everything, harry.
It was obviously not an accident.
It must be put that way to the public. leaving the theater with her mother.
She went back to her dressing room.
They found her lying on the floor.
She'd swallowed something- by mistake, they say.
She died instantaneously.
It's tragic, of course, but you mustn't brood over it.
You must see it in its proper perspective.
Put it out of your mind.
Come dine with me.
Afterwards, we'll see## don giovanni.
You can come to my sister's box.
So I have murdered sibyl vane, as surely as if
I'd cut her throat.
I can't see why you should blame yourself.
She thought she'd lost you, but no woman destroys herself who isn't already unbalanced.
If you'd married this girl, you'd both have been wretched.
It would have failed.
I remember your saying good resolutions are always made too late.
Mine certainly were.
View this tragedy as an episode in the spectacle of life.
What is it that has happened?
Someone has killed herself for love of you.
I wish I'd had such an experience.
The women who have admired me have always insisted on living on long after I've ceased to care for them.
They become stout and tedious.
They go in for reminiscences- that awful memory of woman.
I found myself next to such a woman the other night.
She had once proposed to sacrifice the world for me.
That moment fills one with the terror of eternity.
It happened years ago.
She said I'd spoiled her life.
However, she ate an enormous dinner.
No woman would have done for me what sibyl did for you.
Will you dine with me tonight?
I don't feel up to it.
Perhaps you'll join me at the opera.
My sister's box number is 27.
You'll see her name on the door.
I don't want you to miss the duet.
Mr. Hallward, mr. Gray's gone to the opera.
To the opera?
Yes, sir. Is there any message, sir?
No. No. I'll come by in the morning.
In the morning,
Dorian no longer wanted the consolation of his friend, nor his reproaches.
His pride and his sense of guilt prompted him to assume an air of indifference.
Hello, Basil.
Sorry to keep you.
Have you had breakfast?
Yes, thank you.
I'm famished.
Mind if I eat?
Of course not.
You went to the opera with sibyl vane lying dead?
What is past is past.
You call yesterday the past?
Shallow people require years to get rid of an emotion.
A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he invents pleasures.
I won't be at the mercy of my emotions.
I want to use them.
Something has changed you completely.
You look exactly the same, but you talk as if you had no heart.
You've come too late.
If you'd come yesterday at a particular moment- half past 5:00 or quarter to 6:00- you would have seen how deeply I was affected.
Harry had no idea what
I was going through.
I suffered immensely.
Then it passed away.
I cannot repeat an emotion.
No one can.
This isn't you talking, Dorian.
These are harry's ideas.
It has nothing to do with harry.
Harry didn't give you that yellow book I saw?
It's vile, evil, corrupt, decadent.
I detest it.
What would you like me to read, Basil?
Since you ask me... the light of asia.
I'm never without it.
The story of buddha?
The story of buddha, a good man.
Promise me you'll read it.
I promise.
You've done a sketch of sibyl.
Charming.
May I have it?
Of course.
I must go now,
Dorian.
I'm relieved to find you in good spirits in spite of what's happened.
It's good of you to be so concerned.
Before I go,
I'd like to look at my painting of you.
There's a screen in front of it.
I thought the room looked different.
The light was too strong.
Surely not.
It's an admirable place for it.
Wait.
You must not look at it.
Not look at my work?
You're not serious.
Why shouldn't i?
I don't offer any explanation, but if you try to look at that picture,
I'll never speak to you again.
What on earth is the matter with you?
I'm planning to exhibit it next month.
You told me a month ago you'd never exhibit it.
You told harry the same thing.
At that time, the painting had a strange fascination for me.
It seemed to have a life of its own.
It affected me so much,
I felt I couldn't let it be seen publicly.
Perhaps you've seen the same mysterious quality in it.
Have you noticed something curious in the painting- something that at first did not strike you but revealed itself to you suddenly?
I see you did.
I saw something in it- something that seemed to be very curious.
You were right.
There can be something fatal about a portrait.
I think I understand what you feel, and I respect your wishes.
Perhaps someday you'll recover from it as I did.
I'll certainly not let it destroy our friendship.
I'm glad of that.
Good-bye, Dorian.
Good-bye, Basil.
It had been mad of him to allow the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room to which his friends had access.
Henceforth, he must be on his guard against everyone.
At the top of the house was his old schoolroom, which had not been used for years.
No one ever entered it.
Nothing was in it but old schoolbooks and toys gathering dust and cobwebs.
The picture could be safely hidden away there.
He would lock it up.
He himself would keep the key.
There was no need for the servants ever to enter the room.
He would have to let victor go and the others.
He must bring new servants into the house.
In this room, every moment of his childhood and its stainless purity came back to him.
Here, among the innocent souvenirs of his childhood, the hideous portrait would be forever hidden away.
The face painted in the canvas could grow bestial, sodden, and unclean, and no one would ever see it- no one... except himself.
He was to have eternal youth while the portrait bore the burden of his shame.
He was caught in an evil destiny.
As the years passed, the miracle of Dorian's changeless youth caused wonder but rarely suspicion.
Even those who had heard the most evil things against him- strange rumors about his mode of life which became the chatter of the clubs- could not believe anything to his dishonor when they saw him.
He had the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world.
But while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.
Curious stories were current about him.
It was rumored he'd been seen in a low den in the distant parts of whitechapel.
His extraordinary absences became notorious, and when he reappeared again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners or look at him with cold, searching eyes.
Some of those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him.
Women who, for his sake, had set convention at defiance would seem to go pale if Dorian Gray entered the room.
He could not endure to be long out of england or to be separated from the picture.
He was afraid that during his absence someone might gain access to the room where it was hidden.
Then suddenly, some night he would go down to dreadful places near blue gate fields and stay there day after day.
When he had recovered from visits to the abyss, he would stand in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself but filled at other times with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of evil.
He would examine with minute care the hideous lines that scarred the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy, sensual mouth, wondering which were more horrible- the signs of sin or the signs of age.
He found reasons to justify his actions.
He told himself that man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations.
To live the simple, sincere, honest life was hardly to live at all.
Was insincerity such a terrible thing?
Dorian thought not.
Twas merely a method by which we could multiply our personalities.
Yet, there was one person towards whom he found it difficult to be insincere.
It was Basil Hallward's niece Gladys, who had loved him since she was a child.
So, good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd rather brave the cold on a leafless tree than a prisoner be in a cage of gold
I was close by and came in.
Found this old song in your piano bench.
It's charming.
So is the face my uncle sketched on it.
He did do it, didn't he?
I know his style so well.
Did she sing this song?
Who is she?
Do tell me about her.
She died many years ago, when you were only a little girl.
Did you love her very much, Dorian?
Yes.
Good-bye, Dorian.
I'm looking forward to your party.
It will be wonderful.
I'm not as lovely as that picture, am i?
Of course not.
I think
I've discovered why Dorian hasn't proposed to me.
I've decided what to do.
What have you decided?
I'm going to ask him to marry me- tonight, perhaps.
What about david stone?
He wouldn't take you to Dorian's party if he knew your intentions.
Of course he would, but I don't intend to tell him.
No, don't tell david.
You cad!
I never thoughtu'd eavesdrop.
Don't be alarmed about Dorian, mr. Hallward.
Gladys will marry me.
I have nothing to say about it?
I wouldn't let you marry that devil.
Don't say anything against him.
There are others to say it for me.
There's no evil in Dorian.
Anybody can see that by looking at him.
He hasn't asked you.
I'll ask him myself, tonight.
In front of those people?
I'll get him alone.
It's a big house.
Good night, sir.
Good night, david.
What's wrong, Dorian?
Is there something
I don't know about?
You must have heard the stories they tell of me.
Don't they frighten you?
I don't believe them.
Suppose I told you they're true?
I will never believe anything evil of you.
What do
## you ## know of evil?
I only know there is none in you.
If you had some great trouble, Dorian,
I would want to share it.
If I were to marry you, it would be an incredible wickedness.
Is that a way of saying you don't love me?
If you like.
It's very beautiful, Dorian.
Thank you.
Would you find david for me?
I must go now.
I've been exploring your house, Dorian.
It's better than a museum.
You must have some priceless possessions in that room if you keep them locked up.
May I see them sometime?
What rare things have you stored away there, Dorian?
I suspected as much.
I want to leave now, david.
Of course.
Good night,
Dorian.
Good night.
It was november 9th, the eve of his 38th birthday, as Dorian often remembered afterwards.
He was walking home about 11:00 from Lord Henry's.
A strange sense of fear for which he could not account came over him at the sight of Basil Hallward and prevented him from making any sign of recognition.
Dorian!
I thought it was you- or your fur coat- but I wasn't sure.
Didn't you recognize me?
In this fog?
I can't recognize grosvenor square.
My house must be somewhere about, but I'm not certain.
I've been waiting for you since 9:00.
I told your man to go to bed.
I'm off to Paris tonight.
I wanted to see you before I left.
I'm sorry you're going away.
I suppose you'll be back soon?
I shall be gone for several months.
I'm taking a studio in Paris to finish a picture
I have in my head.
Gladys will join me later on.
May I come in for a moment?
Won't you miss your train?
It leaves at 12:15.
It's only 11:00.
I was going to the club to look for you.
Luggage won't delay me.
I've sent on my things.
I have only this bag.
Come in, or the fog will get into the house.
I hope you're not going to talk about anything serious.
Nothing is serious nowadays- at least, nothing should be.
What I have to say is## serious, Dorian.
Don't frown like that.
You make it so much more difficult for me.
I hope it's not about myself.
I'm tired of myself.
It is about yourself, and I must say it to you.
I'll only keep you half an hour.
You sound terrifying, Basil.
It's for your sake
I'm speaking.
I think you should know the things that are being said against you.
I don't want to know them.
I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don't interest me.
They lack novelty.
You must be interested in your own reputation.
Mind you, I don't believe these rumors.
I can't believe them when I see you.
There aren't any secret vices.
Such things write themselves across a man's face.
You, with your untroubled youth-
I find it hard to credit anything against you.
When I hear these things people whisper,
I don't know what to say.
I absolve you from the necessity of defending me.
You can't dismiss these charges.
Why does the duke leave a room when you enter?
Not because he knows about my life, but because
I know about his.
Why are your friendships fatal to people?
That boy in the guards committed suicide.
What about adrian singleton and Lord wayne's son?
What gentleman would be seen with either of them?
The boy in the guards loved a woman he felt he couldn't live without.
Am I to blame?
Wayne's son marries a woman no one receives.
Is that my fault?
Adrian writes his friend's name across a bill.
Am I his keeper?
One can judge a man by the effect he has on his friends.
Yours seem filled with an insatiable madness for pleasure.
And when I think how fond Gladys is of you... what has Gladys to do with it?
Nothing, I hope, and nothing in the future, if I can prevent it.
I'm told things it seems impossible to doubt.
Lord wallace was my friend at oxford.
He showed me a letter his wife had written when she was dying.
Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read.
I told him that I knew you, and you were incapable of anything of the kind.
No. Do I know you?
Before I could answer that,
I should have to see your soul.
To see my soul.
Yes, to see your soul, but only god can do that.
You shall see it yourself, tonight.
Why shouldn't you look at it?
It's your own handiwork.
You can tell the world about it afterward, if you like.
No one will believe you.
You've chattered enough about corruption.
Now you'll look at it.
I'll show you my soul.
I can make no sense out of what you're saying.
I only ask you to give me some answer to the horrible charges against you.
Tell me they're untrue, and I'll believe you.
Come upstairs, Basil.
I keep a diary from day to day.
I'll show it to you.
I don't want to read anything.
I want a plain answer to my question.
You'll find that upstairs.
You won't have to read long.
You're the one man in the world who's entitled to know everything about me.
You've had more to do with my life than you think.
You think it's only god who sees the soul?
In spite of the indescribable corruption of the portrait,
Basil was still able to recognize his painting of Dorian.
It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror came.
It was as if some moral leprosy were eating the thing away.
He could not believe he had made this portrait, yet there was his name, just as he had painted it.
But this is monstrous.
It's beyond nature, beyond reason.
What does it mean?
On the day you finished this painting,
I made a wish.
Perhaps
## you ## would call it a prayer.
My wish was granted.
You told me you had destroyed my painting.
I was wrong.
It has destroyed me.
It has the eyes of a devil.
Each of us has heaven and hell in him.
If this is true, if this is what you've done with your life, it is far worse than anything said of you.
Do you know how to pray, Dorian?
What is it we were taught to say in our boyhood- lead us not into temptation, forgive us our sins, wash away our iniquities.
Let us say them together.
It's too late, Basil.
The prayer of your pride was answered.
The prayer of your repentance may be answered also.
Do you think
I haven't tried?
I tell you, it's no use.
Isn't there a verse somewhere-
"though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them white as snow"?
Only last week,
Gladys recalled the day this painting was finished.
She remembered putting her initial under my signature.
There it is, just as she made it.
If she could see it now.
I can still pray,
Dorian, if you can't.
Gladys must never know, yet sometime, somehow,
Basil might reveal his secret to her, the one person in the world whose good opinion was indispensable to him.
An uncontrollable feeling of hatred for Basil came over him, together with a terror of the knowledge he had given him and the use he might make of it.
Panic seized him.
He felt like a hunted animal- cornered, desperate.
Oh!
It was as if the painting had sweated a dew of blood.
He felt that he had struck a mortal blow not only at his friend, but at himself.
It seemed to him unbearable that what he had done could never be undone.
Basil was dead.
Men were strangled in england for what he had done, and yet, what evidence was there against him?
Basil had left the house at 11:00.
No one had seen him come in again.
Most of the servants were at selby.
His valet had gone to bed.
Paris! It was to Paris that Basil had gone, by the midnight train, as he had intended.
I'm sorry to wake you, francis.
I forgot my latchkey.
What time is it?
Half past 12:00, sir.
Wake me at 9:00 in the morning.
I have work to do.
Yes, sir.
Did anyone call this evening?
Mr. Hallward, sir.
He stayed till 11:00 and then went to catch his train.
He was leaving for Paris.
Did he leave any message?
He said he would write you from Paris if he didn't find you at your club.
Thank you, francis.
Is there anything more, sir?
I'm writing a letter.
Deliver it early in the morning to mr. Allen campbell.
You'll find the address on the envelope.
Yes, sir.
Good night, sir.
When allen campbell received his letter, he would come.
He would come at once.
Allen would help him.
He was the only one who could " help him.
But what if allen campbell should be out of england?
Days would pass before he could come.
Perhaps he would refuse to come.
Mr. Allen campbell, sir.
This is kind of you, allen.
You said it was a matter of life and death.
Listen to this.
"I sent my soul through the invisible,
"some letter of that after-life to spell:
"And by and by my soul returned to me,
"I myself am heaven and hell."
That's quite good, don't you think?
I didn't come to discuss the verses of omar khayyam.
Of course not.
Please sit down.
I'll tell you why I sent for you.
In a locked room at the top of this house, a room to which no one but myself has access, a dead man is lying across a table.
He's been dead 10 hours.
Who he is, why he died, are matters that do not concern you.
What you must do- there's no need for you to go on.
Your horrible secrets don't interest me.
They'll have to interest you.
You are the one man who is able to save me.
I've seen your name in scientific reviews in connection with certain experiments.
What has that to do with you?
You have got to destroy the thing upstairs- destroy it so that not a vestige is left.
Nobody saw this person come into the house.
When he is missed, not a trace of him must be found here.
Change him and everything that belongs to him, including his coat and his traveling bag, into a handful of ashes.
You must be insane to suppose I'd lift a finger to help you.
It was suicide.
What drove him to it?
You won't do this for me?
How can you ask me, of all men, to mix myself up in this horror?
Allen, it was murder.
I killed him.
He was responsible for the ruin of my life.
He didn't intend it, but the result was the same.
You are certain to be caught.
No man commits a crime without doing something stupid.
I'll have no part of it.
We were friends once, allen.
I regret that.
If you don't help me,
I am lost.
They will hang me.
Let them.
You refuse?
Yes.
I entreat you.
It's useless.
I'm sorry, allen.
You leave me no alternative.
I've written a letter.
Here it is.
You see the address.
If you don't help me,
I must send it.
If you don't help me, i! Will
"send it.
You know what the result will be.
The thing is quite simple, allen.
It would kill her.
I didn't think you would want her name involved in such a scandal.
I cannot do it.
You have no choice.
I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.
You've saved my life.
Dorian dined that evening with lady narborough, who had what Lord Henry described as the remains of a really remarkable ugliness.
You left early last night,
Dorian.
Did you go home or to the club?
Why are you so inquisitive?
I came in at 12:30.
If you want corroborative evidence, you can ask my man.
Two hours unaccounted for,
Dorian.
I suspect they'll bear investigation- or perhaps they will not.
You've hardly touched my dinner.
I believe you're in love.
I haven't been in love for a week, not since madame de ferrol left town.
She's a wonderful woman.
When her third husband died, her hair turned gold.
Husbands of beautiful women belong to the criminal classes.
The world says you're wicked.
What world says that?
It can only be the## next world.
Everyone I know says he's wicked.
It's monstrous the way people go about saying things behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.
Women love us for our defects.
If we have enough of them, they forgive us anything.
No one will persuade me that mr. Gray is wicked.
I shall never forgive him for remaining a bachelor.
Shouldn't we find him a wife, Lord Henry?
I'm always telling him so.
I shall go through debrett and draw out a list of eligible young ladies.
With their ages?
Only slightly edited.
I want it to be a suitable alliance.
I shall save you the trouble of looking.
I have chosen her, if she will have me.
I don't believe it.
Gladys, darling, will you marry me?
Of course I will, darling.
This is the only marriage
I've ever approved of.
How terribly exciting!
I congratulate you both.
For months, the mysterious disappearance of Basil Hallward was the sensation of London.
You don't mind if
I work while we talk?
Not at all.
It's an urgent matter.
Tell me what you discovered in france.
Nothing at all.
We hunted up everyone acquainted with my uncle.
Not one had seen him.
The Paris police don't believe he arrived in france.
Here at scotland yard, we're equally convinced he did leave London.
The man in the gray ulster who boarded at victoria station was undoubtedly
Basil Hallward.
What are we to do now?
You're both young.
I understand you're engaged to marry.
Go on with your own lives peacefully.
Believe me, that's the best course.
Scotland yard will not forget Basil Hallward.
I thought Gladys should go away for a while.
I'm going to my country place at selby tomorrow.
Gladys will join me with friends on thursday.
We'd be delighted if you'd join us.
I can't get away, but I'm glad you're going.
The diversion will do you good.
Thank you, sir robert.
You've been very kind.
Not at all.
Mr. Gray, are you acquainted with a young man named allen campbell?
Yes. At one time, we were great friends.
It's been a long time since I've seen him.
Why do you ask?
I've just received a tragic notice.
This morning, allen campbell died by his own hand.
Why on earth should allen campbell...
I thought you might give me a clue.
He had everything to live for.
He was achieving a name for himself in science.
He left no note, no letter, no explanation?
None. Whatever drove him to it, he took the secret with him.
How little we really know what goes on inside a man.
Yes.
You've been sad all evening.
Is it allen campbell?
Perhaps.
I'm sorry.
Let's be married soon- in a fortnight.
A simple wedding with only our closest friends.
A fortnight?
You call that soon?
Good night, darling.
I'll come to selby on the thursday train with janet.
I'll be at the station.
Allen campbell.
Would allen's blood be on the painting now?
There were other roads to forgetfulness than the one that allen took.
Where to, sir?
Blue gate fields.
Yes, sir.
One day, we shall be awakened with suffering and dismay to the realization that the soul is not a superstition nor the spirit of man a material substance that can be viewed under a microscope.
The eternal words are as true today as when he uttered them.
"What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul?"
The soul is not an illusion.
It is a terrible reality.
It can be bought and sold and bartered away.
It can be poisoned or made perfect.
That man, rich or poor, who has the light of faith and charity within himself, even though he were plunged into the very pit of darkness, would still enjoy the clear light of day.
But the wretched creature whose soul is filled with dark thoughts and foul deeds must dwell in darkness even though he walk under the noonday sun.
He must carry his own vile dungeon round with him.
What's that you're playing?
It has a name, hasn't it?
A kind of name.
It's called
## prelude.
Play something else.
Why you like that music?
I heard someone play that piece before...
18 years ago.
A woman?
Every time I get back to London,
I look for him.
Sir tristan, my sister called him, because he was like a knight.
If he was in rangoon or valparaiso,
I'd find him, but in London it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I don't know his real name.
I don't even know what he looks like.
When you find him, what will you do?
Maybe he's dead already.
Did you think of that?
I'll keep on looking.
You're not english.
What is "english"?
There are men, and there are women.
This is sir tristan, kate, darling.
Don't call me that, adrian.
I heard Lord Henry call you sir tristan.
At the time,
I thought it fit.
Why don't we see you?
I have all I need here- drink and drugs and no friends.
I had too many friends.
Oh, he's drawing a picture of you, sir.
Come and look at it.
What would you like- a song, poem, painting?
I do all three surpassingly well.
It seems to me there's something lacking.
I have it.
But grim to see... is a gallows tree.
Good-bye, adrian.
And green or dry, a man must die before it bears its fruit.
Good-bye, sir tristan.
What did you call him?
Sit down.
I'll draw your picture for the price of three drinks... four drinks.
Sir tristan, you said.
And sir tristan rode forth into the forest, seeking his only love.
He has gone to kill your friend.
Justice has come to england... without wig or gown.
Come on, kate.
If it's money you want-
I'm sibyl vane's brother.
Does that mean anything to you?
No, nothing.
Why are you called sir tristan?
It happens to be my name.
You're lying. 18 years,
I've been looking for you.
How old do you think I am?
Why didn't you murder him?
They could only have hanged you for it.
He's not the man
I'm looking for.
He's too young.
How old do you think he is?
22, I'd say.
Ha ha ha!
What are you laughing at?
Dorian gray has looked 22 for the last 20 years.
What did you say his name was?
In your case, this strange impulse to be good is merely the effect of your approaching marriage.
It'll wear off.
Would you pull that blind?
The truth is,
I want to be better.
At least it will be a novel sensation.
It needn't become a habit.
Marriage is a habit- a bad habit.
I trust it won't make you a hopelessly reformed character.
What are people talking about in London?
They were talking about
Basil's disappearance.
Now they're taken up with allen campbell's suicide.
What do you think happened to Basil?
I suppose we shall be told that he's been seen in san francisco.
Everyone who disappears is said to be seen in san francisco.
It must be a delightful city.
He was a fine painter,
I'm certain.
The best thing
Basil did was that wonderful portrait of you.
What is your secret?
You don't look a day older than you did when that portrait was painted.
Perhaps I'll tell you someday.
To get back my youth,
I'd do anything except get up early, exercise, or be respectable.
I sometimes think
I'd give anything if I could change and grow old.
My good resolutions may have come too late.
Though Dorian placed guards about the estate, the consciousness of being hunted, snared, tracked down began to dominate him.
In the small hours of the night, when every sound is seized upon by the distraught imagination, remorse and terror laid hold of him.
Each detail of his crimes came back to him in nightmares with added horror, haunting him relentlessly with the living death of his soul.
With the day came the cruel necessity to dissemble to Gladys and to his guests.
Have you had good sport?
Not very good.
The birds have gone to the open.
It may be better after lunch.
Don't shoot it, geoffrey.
Nonsense!
I've hit a beater!
The idiot got in front of the gun.
Stop shooting!
A man's hurt!
Sir, where is he?
Here. Why on earth don't you keep your men back?
Spoiled my shooting for the day.
I've told them the shooting's stopped for today.
It wouldn't look well to go on.
Is the man- he's dead. He received the charge in his chest.
Thornton. Come in.
I suppose you've come about the accident.
Was he married?
Did he have dependents?
I'll write them any sum you think necessary.
We don't know him.
That's why
I came to you.
Wasn't he one of your men?
Never saw him before.
Seems like a sailor.
A sailor?
Looks as if he'd been a sort of sailor- tattooed on both arms.
Wasn't anything found on him that would tell his names?
Money-not much- and a six-shooter.
No name of any kind.
Decent-looking man, but rough-like.
Sort of sailor, we think.
Where is the body?
In an empty stable at the home farm.
Show me his face.
Come in.
What is it, Dorian?
Oh, but you haven't changed.
You'll be late for dinner.
I wanted to look at you.
I know, darling.
I've felt that way so often about you.
Good-bye, Gladys.
Good-bye?
Until half past 8:00.
Until half past 8:00.
Go on.
Shall I go on, sir?
Yes.
Dorian!
David, what brings you to selby?
Have you seen Dorian?
What is it?
What's happened?
Dorian's gone to London.
Didn't you know?
David passed him on his way from the station.
He looked black as thunder.
I thought he'd found out what I'd been up to.
What have you been up to?
You'll put it down to jealousy.
I don't deny jealousy's mixed up in it.
I had a dreadful presentiment.
When you announced the marriage,
I grew desperate to stop it.
What is it you've done, david?
There's a locked room in Dorian's house.
I didn't attach any importance to it at first.
He could have locked up anything.
Then one of Dorian's valets came to see me about a position.
It struck me how often Dorian changed his servants.
This one told me
Dorian locked himself in that room at all hours.
One night, he heard a noise and went to investigate.
Dorian came out and looked at him as if he could kill him, he said.
He accused him of spying and sacked him.
I felt if I could get into that room,
I might find something to stop this marriage.
And did you get in?
I bribed one of the servants to get me an impression of the lock.
Here's the key.
I waited until Dorian came down here to selby and then let myself in.
I know you'll despise me for stooping to this, but it doesn't matter what you think of me if I can stop you from marrying him.
What did you find in the room?
Nothing, really.
It's an old schoolroom with books and a portrait with a covering.
Portrait? Of whom?
I don't know.
The original must be a monstrous person, if an original exists.
Has a vague family resemblance to Dorian- a sort of middle-aged, mad, gruesome uncle with a debauched face and blood all over it.
Your uncle painted it.
My uncle never painted such a picture.
He signed it.
I'd been counting so much on finding something to help me that I decided I'd been doing Dorian an injustice.
I had an impulse to come here and make a clean breast of it, give you my blessing and ask your forgiveness.
Describe the portrait in greater detail.
There's a curious cat, like the one in
Dorian's drawing room, only in the portrait the eyes shine in an evil way that's indescribable.
Did you notice anything unusual about the signature?
No,
I don't think so.
Now that I see you,
Gladys,
I can't say what I intended to.
I know that this marriage is wrong.
There's something strange and evil in Dorian.
Was there a letter "g" under the signature on that painting, david, like this?
I believe there was.
How did you know?
Yes, gibson?
Mr. Gray asked me to bring you this letter when I got back from the station.
He said I must give it to you in person.
Once I said that if I were to marry you, it would be an incredible wickedness.
You thought it was a way of saying
I didn't love you.
I do love you, more than anything in the world, but I only bring disaster on those who love me.
If you knew how I've already wronged you, you would turn from me in horror.
You will never see me again.
Try to remember me, dear Gladys, without bitterness.
This is the only good thing
I have ever done.
Won't you tell us what it is?
Perhaps we can help you.
We must go to London at once.
Was it true that one could never change?
He longed for the unstained purity of his youth, before he had prayed in a monstrous moment of pride and passion that the painting should bear the burden of the years and of his corruption.
Sibyl vane was dead, and now her brother would be hidden in a nameless grave.
Allen campbell had shot himself, and Basil... nothing could alter that.
It was of the future that he must think.
He had spared Gladys.
Would there be any sign of his one good deed in the portrait?
It was there- almost imperceptible, but surely it was there in the eyes, struggling through the horror and the loathsomeness.
There was hope for him, then.
He would go away, leave england forever, live obscurely in a distant country, find peace in a life of humility and self-denial.
He would expel every sign of evil from the painted face.
He would watch the hideousness fade and change.
But the painting would always be there to tempt his weakness.
Better to destroy it, to grow old inevitably as all men grow old.
If he fell into evil ways, to be punished as all men are punished.
Better if each sin of his life were to breed sure, swift penalty.
The knife that had killed
Basil Hallward would kill his portrait also and free him at a stroke from the evil enchantment of the past.
But when the knife pierced the heart of the portrait, an extraordinary thing happened.
Father, forgive me, for I have sinned.
Father, forgive me, for I have sinned.
Through my fault, through my most grievous fault.
Heaven forgive me.
Take Gladys home, david.

Here, here's a bit of something for you.
Now, now, laddie, I only wanted to be friendly.
Here you are now, Robbie.
Wait a minute, now.
He'll no leave the grave.
Not since Wednesday last, when we buried the lad.
Your son, ma'am?
He must have been a fine lad for the wee dog to love him so.
Aye, a fine lad he was.
Gentle with all little things like Robbie here.
Now I cannot get the dog to leave here.
But it's probably for the best for I have not got the money to afford a grave watcher.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think, right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Oh, they're uncommon bold, the grave robbers, and the daft doctors who drive them on.
I'm by way of being a medico myself.
A doctor?
A student.
I've been studying under Dr. MacFarlane.
That is, I've been studying until today.
Here we are, ma'am.
Thank you.
Come, little miss.
Cabman Gray will carry you safe enough.
Would you like to give my horse a pat?
Yes.
He knows every little girl in Edinburgh.
Someday, when you're running and playing in the streets, he'll nicker at you as we go by.
I can't run and play.
Hey, lass, I forgot that.
All the more reason then for friend here to give you a hello.
He'll keep an eye out for you.
Won't you, friend?
There, there we are.
There now, safe in your own wee cab.
Now you watch sharp, little miss, for my horse to give you a hello.
I would like to see Dr. MacFarlane.
It's all right, darling.
Don't be afraid.
Dr. MacFarlane?
I'm Mrs. Marsh and this is my daughter Georgina.
Dr. Maximillian of Leyden asked me to present this to you.
Dr. Maximillian, a very famous colleague of mine.
He thought you might examine my little girl.
Delighted to honor his request.
Come in.
Thank you, Doctor.
Born paralyzed?
No, it was an accident.
Was the paralysis immediate?
No, Doctor.
She seemed to get better.
Then about six months later, she began to complain of pain in her back.
How long after that was paralysis complete?
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
Is this pain sporadic or constant?
It comes at intervals.
They used to be months apart, but they've been growing more frequent.
Much more frequent.
Tell me, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
I don't know.
Well, is it in the middle of your back?
I don't know.
Is it low down in your back?
I don't know.
Point to where it hurts.
You can at least do that, can't you?
Oh, this is useless, ma'am.
Please, darling, don't be so stubborn.
Mother, he frightens me.
Oh, excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane.
Come in, boy, come in.
Perhaps you can do something with this young lady.
I can't get an aye, yes or no out of her.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you...
Well, it's a chance to test your bedside manner.
Take a look at the child.
Are you a doctor, too?
Not yet.
You'll be a good one.
I know all about doctors.
That's a nice chair you have.
Useful, too.
It isn't English, is it?
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it?
About where it hurts?
Why, yes.
Well, it's sort of all around here and then down my legs.
It aches as if I'd been walking an awfully long way.
That's funny, isn't it because I can't walk at all.
Would you mind very much if I lifted you onto that table in there?
The child seems to take to the lad.
Yes, she does.
What sort of an accident was it, ma'am?
A carriage overturned.
My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
How long ago?
Three years.
Dr. MacFarlane?
Excuse me.
Certainly.
See that?
Fettes, wheel the little girl into the hall.
It seems that Dr. Maximillian is right.
The violence of the accident must have disturbed the tissues and caused a traumatic tumor.
A sort of growth that presses on the nerve centers.
But can anything be done for her?
Perhaps.
A very delicate operation.
An operation which has never been performed before.
But I believe it could be done.
And you will try?
You will operate?
Not I, madam.
But, Doctor, in Leyden, in Paris, wherever I've taken Georgina, they've mentioned your name.
I've come to think of you as our only hope.
Believe me, madam, if
I were only a doctor,
I'd undertake this operation at once, but I'm more dominie than doctor. I have a school to run.
But surely in a case like this, a child, a little child who can never walk or run...
I regret it, madam, but
I have the responsibility of training 30 other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
Then there's nothing I can say for one small child.
I'm not heartless, madam.
I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me,
I'd have no time for teaching.
And that's a great responsibility upon me, ma'am.
A great responsibility.
Fettes, will you see
Mrs. Marsh to the door?
And good day to you, ma'am.
Yes, sir.
What do you want to see me about, Fettes?
Dr. MacFarlane, I'm afraid
I have to give up medicine.
Give up medicine?
Why, you're made for a doctor, young man.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.
You see, my father is vicar at Thrums.
It's a small parish.
Not much of a living.
Oh, you're too good a man, Fettes.
I'll not let you quit.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll make an assistant of you.
That'll pay your keep and your tuition, too.
But I thought only the best students were made assistants?
Well aren't you a good student?
But Richardson?
Richardson's a fine student.
He's got a glib tongue.
But you'll be a better doctor.
Come along to the anatomy room and I'll explain your new duties.
Dr. MacFarlane?
I'd like a word with you, if I may.
I'll follow you, Fettes.
You're not having
Fettes for your assistant.
Why not?
He's a good lad.
Bright and able.
Aye, he is a good lad.
That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You think it'll spoil the boy?
Wasn't I assistant to Knox?
Aye.
Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
Don't worry.
It'll do the boy no harm.
All my gratitude, sir.
I can never express it.
There'll be satisfaction enough for me in knowing I've trained the great Dr. Fettes.
Now, as to your duties.
It's up to you to keep the accounts and to distribute the specimens to the students.
Also, in as much as you'll be living in the house.
Joseph?
What the devil are you doing sneaking about like a redskin?
Make a little noise, man.
Let people know you're about.
Yes, doctor, yes.
Otherwise I might get the idea you're trying to spy on me.
You know where we get the bodies for dissection?
From the municipal council.
They're the bodies of paupers.
That's what the law stipulates, but there aren't enough of them, Fettes.
There aren't enough of them.
Here, give me a hand.
This is heavy.
You'll find the specimen in good condition.
He was as bright and lively as a thrush, not a week long gone.
A likely lad, I'm told.
You're a new assistant?
Aye.
Oh, I'm Donald Fettes.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Mr. Gray?
That's right.
Cabman Gray.
I've had some dealings with MacFarlane in the past, you understand?
But I've always gotten on with his assistants, providing, of course, they understand my humble position.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you.
Of course.
That's the soul of the business.
The pay.
I have no doubt you have the key in your pocket.
And the desk is over there.
My fee is as usual, 10 pounds.
Now although it's none of my business,
I'd make the proper entry if I were you.
Received one specimen, 10 pounds.
Shall we say from the MacDuffs?
A royal name.
Good night, Mr. Gray.
My respects, Master Fettes.
And may this be the first of many profitable meetings.
Well, well, my boy.
Your first meeting with the redoubtable Gray.
You can count it a milestone in your medical career.
All right, gentlemen, that will do.
Settle down.
Dr. MacFarlane has asked me to review the points he has just discussed with you.
He started with the construction of the ribs and the hematopoiesis.
I suppose this was your doing, Survis?
Mr. Fettes.
A lady is asking for you.
What lady, Joseph?
If you gentlemen will excuse me.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
Yes.
I want you to help my little girl.
But I'm only a student.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.
It gave me hope that you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
But did he tell you about Georgina?
- Aye.
- Then he must have told you that this disease is progressive.
That it will grow worse, and that soon she will not be able to move at all.
And you won't ask him to help?
I didn't mean it that way.
It's just that I'm not in a position to ask favors.
Ask this one favor.
Of course I will.
Georgina was right.
You are a kind man, Mr. Fettes.
I'll do what I can.
If the doctor says yes, you will find us every morning on the ramparts.
I take Georgina there for her airing.
In an adult, this muscle can apply more than 175 pounds of pressure.
Double that and you have the full strength of the human jaw.
That, gentlemen, is to chew our food and bite our enemies.
Here, Fettes, life can't be all skittles and ladies.
Yes, sir.
Well, I see it's time for our luncheon.
I've a bit of beef to discuss.
So I leave you to whatever arrangements you've made to serve the inner man.
Well, Richardson, I see you have that arm you've been yearning for.
Yes, sir.
This fellow would've been a great one at hurling the bar.
He has a beautiful bicep.
Burke and Hare could never have got the best of him.
What did you say?
Well, I was just making a joke, sir.
It's a poor subject for jest.
Particularly for a medical student.
What did you say to
His Imperial Highness?
Nothing but a merry word about Burke and Hare.
Well, there's nothing in that to get excited about.
They're dead and buried.
They killed his wee doggie, too.
Little Robbie.
Come in.
Well, Fettes, where have you been?
I didn't see you at the afternoon session.
I don't think that I can go on, sir.
What the devil do you mean?
You've got your lodgings and a certain stipend.
I thought I'd arranged everything for you.
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
That man took the body from Greyfriars.
I knew the woman.
I knew the little dog on the grave.
He killed the dog.
And that's why you won't be a doctor?
Not if I have to be a party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
Fettes, I was an assistant once.
I had to deal with men like Gray.
Do you think I did it because I wanted to?
Do you think I want to do it now?
But I must and you must.
Ignorant men have dammed the stream of medical progress with stupid and unjust laws.
And if that dam will not break, the men of medicine have to find other courses.
You understand me?
Yes, but this woman and her son...
I'm sorry for the woman, but her son might be alive today if more doctors had been given the opportunity to work with more human specimens.
As for me, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right.
When i know I need those lifeless subjects for my students enlightenment and my own knowledge.
And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.

Good evening, gentlemen.
How are you?
We'll have a stiffener or two of hot rum.
Then we'll meet this fellow on fairly equal terms of warmth, eh, Fettes?
A fine specimen, isn't he, Toddy MacFarlane?
Come, Toddy, sit down here with me.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Well, then, Dr. MacFarlane.
Though I've known the time, Toddy, when you liked the name.
Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it.
Rough and wild ones they were, too.
But sit down, Toddy, with your friend.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
Medicine?
That'll keep.
Sit down.
You wouldn't want it said of you that you refused a glass to an old friend.
We'll buy you a glass, Gray.
I'm a pretty bad fellow myself, but MacFarlane is the boy.
Oh, Toddy MacFarlane.
Why don't you order for your friend, Toddy?
No, on second thoughts,
I'll do the ordering.
We'll have a bowl of hot punch and a cut from the loin of that young porker.
Oh, don't worry, waiter.
I'm with my friend.
The great Dr. MacFarlane.
He wants to sit here with the commonality.
You were going to speak of medical matters.
Well, don't let my humble presence stop you.
Talk on, Toddy.
I will not have you call me by that name.
You will not have it?
Doctor MacFarlane, you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday?
The lady with the little girl?
- I remember.
- She came again today and wanted me to ask you if you wouldn't break your rule and operate.
She feels that you are her only hope.
So she told me.
I'm a teacher, not a practitioner.
A teacher, aye?
Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor.
Afraid of what?
Afraid you're not as good a doctor as you make out to be.
I'm the best man for the job.
Why don't you do it then?
I'd like for you to do the operation, Toddy.
You?
Since when have you become the protector of little children?
It's not the child I'm concerned with, Toddy.
It's you I'm thinking of.
I'd like to have you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
I'll not do it, Gray.
Oh, yes, you will.
You'll do it to oblige
Mr. Fettes and myself.
No.
Maybe there's some private reasons between you and me that'll make you.
Some long-lost friends, aye Toddy?
Say you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
It might be an interesting case.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
You only want me to do it because I don't want to.
That's it, isn't it, Gray?
Toddy hates me.
Don't call me by that name.
Hear him?
Did you ever see the lads play knife?
Toddy'd like to do that all over my body.
We medicos have a better way than that.
When we dislike a friend, we dissect him.
You'll never get rid of me that way, Toddy.
You and I have two bodies.
Aye, very different sorts of bodies.
But we're closer than if we were in the same skin.
For I saved that skin of yours once.
And you'll not forget it.
After he thought about it, he said it might be an interesting case.
You have his promise, then?
Yes.
But there'll be great pain connected with it, ma'am.
During the operation and afterward.
Great pain and shock.
Pain and shock.
She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.
Now that it seems so close,
I wonder whether I dare trust my child into any but God's hands.
Ma'am, if you'll allow me,
I'd like to give you cause for courage.
Dr. MacFarlane is a great man.
I think he's the greatest man in medicine.
God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
Thank you, Mr. Fettes.
Over here!
Mommy?
Mommy?
Take me to the wall, I think I hear him.
- Hear him?
- The white horse that's going to greet me when he sees me.
Oh, an old acquaintance, aye?
Now you put your arms around me, and we'll go up and see that horse.
It was a brown horse, Mommy.
A cabbie told her his horse would say hello to her the next time he saw her.
Georgina's been looking everywhere for that horse.
Why do you want the white horse to bid you good day, Georgina?
He was a nice horse.
Maybe there's another reason.
Maybe you haven't friends enough.
Could that be it, Georgina?
Of course I don't have friends.
That's because I can't walk.
I try to make myself used to it, though.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things.
You want to walk and run and play?
Really, Mr. Fettes,
I thought you at least would know how much Georgina wants that.
Aye, but I wonder how much.
I want it so much.
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.
Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.
Do you want it that much?
Yes.
Then, Dr. MacFarlane will make you well.
Gray's head.
Is that it, Toddy?
Is that what you broke just now under the poker?
Broken it and have done with him forever.
My poor lad.
My poor, poor lad that can never be free of him.
You're daft.
What's Gray to me?
He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it.
The rest is forgotten.
You may deny him, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Nonsense.
You're a fey creature,
Meg, with mad ideas.
And you have a wildness that holds me to you, my lass.
No great lady can ever take my place?
Come in.
Well, Fettes, I didn't expect to see you on Sunday.
What do you want?
Some powders for that aching head?
That was a furious lot we drank last night.
And in bad company.
It was about last night
I wanted to talk to you about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
Fettes, you're a man of the world.
You wouldn't hold me to a promise given in drink.
But I, well, you see, sir,
I met Mrs. Marsh and I told her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
Look here, Fettes, not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to ensure a successful operation.
I'd have to study the matter.
Have we any subjects?
No, Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
Well, there you are, you see.
Thing's entirely out of the question.
Yes, I suppose so.

To what do I owe the honor of this visit?
Some business, was it of Dr. MacFarlane's?
Dr. MacFarlane didn't send me.
I came of my own accord.
What are the chances of your being able to get us a subject?
Well, that'd be difficult.
Very difficult.
There was a dog that bothered me during the last job.
People are so concerned about dogs.
All in all, it raised the very father and mother of a row.
They say the Kirkyards are to be guarded.
Oh, I wouldn't want to say it'd be impossible to get a subject.
But how soon, man?
Dr. MacFarlane is engaged in some very urgent research at present.
He can't wait very long.
I fear he'll have to.
But can't you give me any idea?
How could I?
I'll do the best I can.
After all, you see, I am financially interested.
You may tell Toddy I'll do what I can when I can.
As he knows I will.
But he must wait and see, like the children do.
Well, if that's your answer,

There, Master Fettes.
Sooner than we thought.
A stroke of luck you might say.
Good.
Why, that's the street singer.
I know her, I tell you.
She was alive and hearty only this evening.
It's impossible she can be dead.
You could not have gotten this body fairly.
You are entirely mistaken.
You had better give me my money and make the proper entry.
Good night, Dr. Fettes.
Well, well, good morning, young Master Fettes.
Dr. MacFarlane, you know the street singer who sang
When Ye Gang Awa, Jamie?
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Oh, this girl was beautiful.
A wild lassie from the Highlands.
Beautiful, you say?
It's a wonder I haven't noticed her.
Oh, this girl.
Dr. MacFarlane, she was murdered.
I went to see Gray last night.
I asked him to bring us a specimen.
On my way, I saw this girl.
I gave her alms money.
She was alive and singing.
Well?
Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.
I am sure and I mean to report it.
It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
Fettes, I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't report it.
Grave-robbing is one thing.
This is murder.
- I don't know that.
Neither do you.
This subject may have been an epileptic.
Thrown a fit, fallen out of bed, cracked her skull, and killed herself.
There's everything explained.
That bruise on her forehead.
I can't believe that.
Believe it or not, it's best that you pretend that you do.
After all, you ordered this subject, received it here and paid for it.
That makes you a party to murder.
If it was murder.
But I didn't ask him to kill.
Who would believe that?
And then, you know, someone else might recognize her.
She was as well-known as the Castlerock.
No, I think we should do what we always do, dissection.
I'll help you, of course.
I want the whole centrum myself for the spinal work.
You know why.
Have a drop, it'll help.
I couldn't swallow.
How long has it been?
Only 20 minutes.
Only 20 minutes.
Now you must watch closely, gentlemen.
Closely.
It's the very heart of the matter.
Wait, doctor, wait, the child's fainting.
Good, so much the better.
She's unconscious.
- Pulse?
- Slow, not too alarming.
Let us proceed.
And the final step.
We push the ganglia to one side, then we make the actual osseous incision here.
So, it's done.
The repair is effective.
And nothing left to do but replace the tissue, and let nature heal what is no longer a defect, merely a wound.
Bravo.
I'll be finished with her in a second.
Then you can consider her your patient, Fettes.
Doctor?
What the devil's the matter with you?
Everlastingly creeping about.
What do you want?
Mr. Gray wants to...
I don't wish to speak to Mr. Gray.
Tell him there'll be no more business between us.
Good afternoon, Toddy.
Oh, well, it seems that I shall have the pleasure of speaking to Mr. Gray myself.
You can go.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.
Not at all friendly.
That has nothing to do with it.
We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection.
It's better for the students.
And that's the end of the matter.
Well, you know what you want and what you don't want.
And there's the end of business between us.
But we'll still be friends, Toddy.
I'll be stopping by once in a while to see you and Meg.
For auld lang syne.
I suppose I can't prevent that, for auld lang syne.
And do you think you're getting rid of me, Toddy?
I would like to speak to you.
Well, I presume you shall.
This won't be my last visit here.
I want to speak to you alone.
I saw something, I heard.
What did you hear?
I know, maybe some other time.
You'll have ample opportunity.
Ample.
Good afternoon, Master Fettes.
Good afternoon.
I just saw Gray.
What was he laughing at?
He has his own idea of a joke.
Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
I've been to see Mrs. Marsh.
Georgina is doing splendidly.
The incision has healed clean and fine, but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
As soon as she's ready, you bring her to me.
I'll show her.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought to those people?
That's the way of it, Fettes.
You bring the lassie to me.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?
You can't find him from a wheelchair.
You have to walk and run to find him.
I can't.
You can't, you can't.
Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses.
Let her stand up and walk.
Her spine's all right.
I know it's all right!
But she must want to stand.
She must want to walk.
Confound it, the child's a cripple.
Of course she wants to walk!
Child, I say to you, get up out of that chair and walk.
Child, I ask you to do a simple thing.
Raise yourself with your hands to a standing posture.
Then step out with your left foot.
Try it.
I say try it.
Lift yourself up, now.
Good.
Now step out.
Step out.
I can't!
I can't, my legs won't move.
Nonsense, they will, they will!
I'm sorry, Dr. MacFarlane.
Georgina's a good child, a brave child.
You saw how she behaved during the operation.
If she says she can't move, she can't move.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
She would if she could.
Then all my surgery is no good.
There's something wrong with the child.
Something I don't know.
Something I can't define, can't diagnose.
I can do nothing for her.
Fettes, you see Mrs. Marsh home.
I'm going to Hobbs.
You can join me there later if you want to.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'll be off unless you have a fare for me.
Some gentleman a little taken with his wine.
MacFarlane will want to be freighted home.
The Dr. MacFarlane?
Aye.
He's in the other room getting stiffer than the bodies he demonstrates.
I'll look in on him.
Toddy.
Oh, it's you, Gray.
Come in, have a glass with me.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy.
More like the old days.
I want someone to talk to.
That Fettes, he was all taken up with the widow, never came back here.
Gray, you know something about the human body.
I've had some experience.
Then you can understand this.
The backbone is a lot of little blocks, and those blocks are all held together so that it works.
Works like that whip of yours.
You know that, don't you?
I've never had it all explained by so learned a man.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles, put the nerves where they should be.
I did it and I did it right.
She won't walk.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl
Fettes was talking about.
The same.
Look here, Gray.
I fitted them together like this.
So that it was right.
Yet, she won't walk.
You can't build life the way you put blocks together, Toddy.
What the devil are you talking about? I'm an anatomist.
I know the body, I know how it works.
You're a fool, Toddy, and no doctor.
It's only the dead ones you know.
I am a doctor, I teach medicine.
Like Knox taught you?
Like I taught you?
In cellars and graveyards?
Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The heart pumps it.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go?
And why things are remembered and forgot?
The nerve centers, the brain.
What makes a thought start?
The brain, I tell you, I know.
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy.
Not from Knox or me would you learn those things.
Look, look at yourself.
Could you be a doctor, a healing man with the things those eyes have seen?
There's a lot of knowledge in those eyes, but no understanding.
You'd not get that from me.
I am a doctor, I tell you, a good doctor.
I could make her walk, but she won't, she won't.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane, and I'll take you safely home and we'll be friends again.
Now that you know that you're
Knox's man and my friend.
Aye, forever.
I'm my own man and I'll have no more to do with you, Gray. Why should I be afraid of you?
What are you holding over me?
I'll tell you what.
I stood up in the witness box and took what should have been coming to you.
I ran through the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears, and the mob yelling for my blood because you were afraid to face it.
Yes, and you're still afraid.
No, I'm not afraid.
Tell.
Shout it from the housetops, but remember this, they hanged Burke, they mobbed Hare, but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
Aye.
There's something in what you say, Toddy.
There is much in what I say, Gray.
And if you have any regard for your neck, you'll leave now.
And stay away from my house, my school, and from me!
Well, I have no wish for a rope cravat.
I never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Dr. MacFarlane.
Ah, Dr. MacFarlane's man, a surprise visit.
Come in.
Come in.
You're welcome to my little nest.
Joseph, is it not?
Yes, that's right.
You had something to say to me?
Yes.
Something very private?
That's very interesting.
Take a chair, Joseph.
Can anyone hear what we say?
Only brother.
I know you kill people to sell bodies.
You say you came here of your own account?
No one sent you?
No one knows that you are here?
Give me money or I tell the police you murder the subjects.
Well, Joseph, you shall have money.
Why should you not?
I don't suppose the great Dr. MacFarlane is over-lavish with his pay, ah?
- No.
- Here, have a glass of this.
You want money?
- Yeah.
And you shall have it.
Let me see.
Five and five.
And then in gold, six.
Shall we say 16 pounds, Joseph?
Yeah.
I have made you give me money, but you smile.
Aren't you angry?
- No, Joseph,
I'm not angry.
Here, some more brandy.
I'll wager it's better than the doctor's, aye?
Drink up, man, drink up.
I have an idea.
A splendid idea.
So excellent an idea that we must drink on it.
You see, I admire you, Joseph.
It took courage to come here and I'm looking for such a man.
But drink, Joseph, drink.
You and I should work together.
You mean, we would sell the bodies to the doctors together?
To dig 'em up?
There'll be no digging.
The Kirkyards are too well-guarded.
We will, so to speak, Burke them.
Burke them?
You're lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
- Yeah, I come from Lisbon.
- But you may have heard the chapbook singers and peddlers of verse cry their names down the street.
You know.
♪ The ruffian dogs, the hellish pair ♪
♪ The villain Burke, the meager Hare ♪
Never heard of this song.
What did they do?
Eighteen people they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox.
10 pounds for a large, 8 for a small.
That's good business, Joseph.
Where did they get the people?
That was Hare's end.
Oh, you should have seen him on the streets.
When he saw some old beldame deep in drink, how he cozened her.
Good day to you, Madame Tosspot.
And would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest?
Come with me to my house and you shall be my guest.
You shall have quarts to drink if you like.
How he cozened them.
We can do that.
But when he'd get them there, then what?
♪ Nor did they handle ax or knife ♪
♪ To take away their victim's life ♪
♪ No sooner done than in the chest ♪
♪ They crammed their lately welcome guest ♪
I don't understand the song.
Tell me plain how they did it.
I'll show you how they did it, Joseph.
I'll show you how they Burked them.
No.
Put your hand down.
How can I show you, man?
This is how they did it, Joseph.
You've no need to be anxious, Meg.
MacFarlane's been drunk and away before.
He'll be back in good time.
Meanwhile, you have me to keep you company.
I'd call that no good fortune.
Oh, there was a time, lass.
A time when I used to bring the dashing young doctor to your door.
But you weren't so uncommon cold to your old friend Gray.
Why must you be at him all the time?
He's my friend.
I like to see my friends.
I like to visit 'em.
Well, he's come home.
You've no excuse now to bear me company.
Gray, what are you doing here?
Haven't I told you...
- Would you grudge me a glass with me old crony, Meg?
Crony indeed.
Get out, Gray.
I brought you a little present, MacFarlane.
In very good condition.
I've ordered nothing from you, Gray.
Ah, but this is a gift.
And I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not refuse.
Gray, I told you to get out.
Wait, Toddy.
That's not friendly.
I want to discuss business.
You are not to set foot in this house again.
For business or any other reason.
And you're getting out now.
I wouldn't do it, Toddy.
I wouldn't be heavy-handed.
It might become known that when the great Dr. MacFarlane finds his anatomy school without subjects, he provides them himself from the midst of his own household.
What the devil are you talking about?
Take a look downstairs, Toddy.
Take a look downstairs.
Where's Fettes?
I'll get him.
Fettes, were you down here when Gray came?
No.
Bring that candle over here.
A member of his household.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right.
You must do with Joseph as you did with the street singer.
A complete dissection, a proper entry in the book.
- No.
- What do you mean?
I'll have no more to do with it.
I'll not put my neck into a noose.
Not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
Don't be a fool, you can't begin and then stop.
Because the entry of the girl's body is in your writing, you'll do as I say.
As for me, I'll attend to Gray.
You're not going to Gray.
He must leave me alone.
No, no!
Come, Mistress Cameron, this is no place for you.
I'll help you upstairs.
You must leave this house.
I can't do that.
You heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself, Master Fettes.
Look at MacFarlane.
But he's a great doctor, a great man.
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding?
Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife?
So that I must play maid servant for the world's sake and his success.
He could have been a great man.
A good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old ways and old life to hold him back.
And Gray.
Gray to hound him to his death.
You're overexcited, Mistress Cameron.
I'm cold as ice.
But Gray's only a resurrection man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
If he were only that.
The man's evil himself.
Someday you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him.
For MacFarlane was to
Knox as you are to him.
That's how he met Gray and roistered with him and drank with him.
Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love.
There's all that between them and more.
Burke and Hare and Knox.
But that's long since.
Gray can't threaten him with that.
Gray has no need to threaten.
Do you remember the trial?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums.
It was a famous case.
And do you remember the porter who testified against Burke?
Aye.
They didn't tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the king's counselor pressed him hard.
How he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
That porter was Gray.
And the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it, who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray...
MacFarlane.
Listen to me, Fettes.
I'm one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane and one part fey.
You're a Lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
I've heard of it.
It's a gift to my people.
And I see MacFarlane and Gray.
The pit yawns for them.
I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.
This is unexpected, Toddy.
I wanted to see you.
You weren't here, so I waited.
What do you want of me, Gray?
Want of you?
Well, I want nothing of you, Toddy.
Gray, I must be rid of you.
You've become a cancer.
A malignant, evil cancer, rotting my mind.
So you've made a disease of me, aye Toddy?
There's only one cure.
I must cut you out.
I'll not leave here until I've finished with you one way or another.
I've gotta be sure that I'm rid of you.
And if there's no other way...
Surely you're not threatening an old friend.
We've never been friends.
Here, Toddy.
Have a drink of something good.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Another little drop will never do you any harm.
You're getting old, Gray.
And it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet, windy streets of Edinburgh.
I have other means of sustenance.
The resurrection business?
That may end sooner than you think.
New laws may come.
What I was gonna say is this, wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Would you bribe me to let you be?
I'd make you rich.
That wouldn't be half so much fun for me as to have you come here and beg.
Beg, beg of you?
You crawling graveyard rat.
Aye, that is my pleasure.
Very well, then.
I beg of you, I beseech you.
Then I would lose the fun of having you come back and beg again.
But why, Gray, why?
It would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy.
You're a pleasure to me.
A pleasure to torment me?
No, a pride to know that
I can force you to my will.
I am a small man, a humble man.
And being poor, I have had to do much that I did not want to do.
But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps to my whistle that long am I a man.
And if I have not that, I have nothing.
Then I am only a cabman and a grave robber.
You'll never get rid of me, Toddy.
Let be, Toddy, let be.
I have no wish to hurt you.
No, Toddy, you'll never get rid of me.
You'll never get rid of me.
Don't force me to kill you, Toddy.
My pride has need of you.
That's better, Toddy.
That's more reasonable.
Where's Fettes?
He's gone.
I sent him away.
I'll not see another boy made miserable like you, Toddy.
You've been with Gray.
Aye.
You'd better look at the face.
Look at it, Meg.
I'm rid of him forever.
He'll not come here again, sneaking and whining and bullying.
Now he'll serve a good purpose, and tomorrow when the last bit of him is dissected, demonstrated, and entered in the students' notebooks, then at last there's an end to him.
The next day, I'll take his horse and cab to sell at the Penicuick Fair.
Then, not a trace left.
Rid of him forever.
No, Toddy.
You're not rid of him.
Come on, come on, come on.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
I thought this was a school day.
I'm not at the school anymore.
I left last night.
Left Dr. MacFarlane?
Play by yourself a little while, darling.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Fettes.
This is serious, Donald.
What's happened?
It isn't because of Georgina, because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
It's not the failure.
I feel that I've learned nothing from MacFarlane.
He taught me the mathematics of anatomy, but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
Mommy?
I feel that MacFarlane had me on the wrong road.
- Mommy?
A road that led to knowledge, but not to healing.
If there had been any healing in the man,
Georgina would be walking now.
- Mommy?
- I think it was the pain of the operation more than anything else.
Mommy, it's the white horse.
I'm sure it's the white horse.
She's afraid that if she stands, the pain will come again.
Nothing that Dr. MacFarlane could ever do would take that out of her mind.
Mommy?
I can't see over the wall.
Georgina, you're standing.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
I wanted to see the white horse.
I've got to tell Dr. MacFarlane.
Mistress Cameron, you will not believe it, but the child has walked.
Stood and walked.
I must tell Dr. MacFarlane.
He's not at home.
Where can I find him?
You don't want to find him.
Your news will keep until I tell him.
But I must tell him. He must know of it.
Please tell me where he is.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly.
If you must babble your news to him, he's at the Fisherman's Tryst.
It's the inn at Pennycuick.
Pennycuick.
I know the inn.
You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig.
He'll welcome the ride back.
I'll be there in an hour.
No matter how much you tried. he couldn't get the better of old Angus, the horse dealer.
A sound horse, a closed carriage and after I'd talked to him a bit,
I got his price down to four pounds and 10.
And worth every bit of 10 pounds.
Surely, Angus, a man who had won so great a victory in a horse deal would buy the poor loser a drink.
Piper, let's have a song.
The man who bought your horse would like you to have a glass of French brandy at his charge.
Now that's very civil of him.
♪ Tae the Lords o' convention
'twas Claverhouse spoke ♪
♪ E'er the King's Crown go down there are crowns to be broke ♪
♪ So each caviler who loves honor and me ♪

Doctor.
The little Marsh girl stood and walked, really stood and walked.
What's that you say?
The little girl, she couldn't walk far.
The muscles were too weak, but she did stand and she took a step or two.
I knew it, I knew it.
The moment I was rid of him.
- Who?
- Gray.
I'm rid of him.
What do you mean about Gray?
I've been able to induce him to leave Edinburgh.
He'll bother me no more.
Drink.
Here's to a good riddance.
Now that he's gone, I'll be a new man, Frettes, and a better teacher.
The doctors from my school will perform miracles.

Shh, still your song, lads.
The MacCreadys are here.
They've come from burying their sister in Glencorse Kirkyard.
Glencorse, that's a lonely cemetery.
Not a soul around for miles.
Those people will be thinking of that.
I'm not worrying about them.
It's our own ends I'm thinking about.
You've no thought of going there?
Gray is not the only man who can handle a mattock and shovel.
I've had some practice in the art.
No, you couldn't do that, Doctor.
I let no opportunity escape me.
I've a whole new course of lectures for you fellows.
We'll need subjects to demonstrate.
Come on.
- No.
Why not?
I must have subjects.
It's the only way I can teach.
It's the only way you can learn.
The stupidity of the people.
The idiocy of their laws shall not stop me.
Nor will they force me to deal with reptilian creatures like Gray.
We can do our own dirty work and we will.
Let's go.
Let me take over, Fettes.
So we can't do without Gray?
Huh, so I'll never be rid of him, aye?
You wanna put it in the back?
No room there.
We'll have to set it between us.
Fettes.
Keep it off me, will you?
Fettes.
Toddy.
Toddy.
Toddy.
Toddy.
Toddy.
Toddy.
Toddy.
Toddy.
Toddy.
Toddy.
Whoa!
What's the matter?
Did you hear something, Fettes?
Nothing but the wind.
Come on.
Never get rid of me.
Never get rid of me.
Never get rid of me,
Never get rid of me.
Never get rid of me.
Never, never, never, never!
Whoa! Whoa!
Fettes, let's have that light.
It's changed.
Fettes, I swear it's changed.
Changed, changed to what?
Hurry with that lamp.
This is not a woman.
Hold that lamp up, I must see her face.
Gray!
Dr. MacFarlane!
Gray!
Professor Gleason.
Beg pardon, madam.
Professor Gleason is here.
Very nice of you to come.
I'm Mrs. Manderley.
- I've heard a great deal about you.
- Nice things, I hope.
Oh, do you know
Brenda and Walter Hartford?
We should know him, Lucy.
We invited him.
Of course. Where are my wits today?
You have been a bit odd.
Something's on your mind.
I guess it's just that
I'm not used to having guests.
Paul, my husband, prefers to bury himself out here in the desert for his work.
Oh, Dr. Retling. Have you met Professor Gleason?
- Very happy to know you.
- How do you do?
- Won't you join us, Professor?
- Don't mind if I do.
- How about you, Doctor?
- Not just now, thank you.
- Brenda?
- You can always count on me.
She's never been known to refuse.
Lucy. Who is this stranger?
You know I dislike having people interrupt my work.
- But you invited Brenda and Walter to-
- Walter is my lawyer.
- He's here on business.
- Relax, Paul.
Professor Gleason is going to tell us about the monkeys in our family trees.
- I didn't know you were a genealogist.
- Oh, yes, yes.
Matter of fact,
I hope this visit... will permit me to clear up some points on your family.
Aren't you descended from the famous Borgias?
Two things we never discuss in this house: my family and Paul's accident.
I don't want to seem insistent... but weren't you the Princess della Borgia before your marriage?
Yes, but our branch of the family didn't go in for poison.
Lucy, please.
We will not discuss it.
We ought to break this up.
Manderley's upset.
I think I'll go and dress for dinner.
Coming, Lucy?
Yes, it is late.
That was an excellent cocktail,
Mrs. Manderley.
Won't you have another one, Professor?
Please do.
Thank you.
Now I know you have forgiven me.
Why, Professor. There's nothing to forgive.
Dinner at 8:00 sharp.
I'm sorry if I've offended you,
Mr. Manderley.
Oh, it's quite all right.
It's my fault.
You see, I'm not used to guests.
Mr. Manderley?
- Oh, you've forgotten your cocktail.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
How about a rubber of bridge?
That's an idea.
You can count me in.
Do you play-
He must have fainted.
Let's get him up to his room.
Paul! Where are you?
- Mr. Manderley.
- Stop that infernal racket.
What do you want?
Oh, there you are.
Dr. Retling would like to see
Professor Gleason's cocktail glass... and I can't find it.
Well, the servants probably swept it up and threw it away.
Why should he want it?
Now, take it easy.
Don't get excited.
Gleason's been poisoned.
- Poisoned? But that's impossible.
- There's every symptom.
You've gotta prepare yourself for trouble if he doesn't pull through.
What do you mean?
The papers are bound to remember Lucy's maiden name- a descendant of the Borgias.
- You're not suggesting that she-
- Of course not.
But you dread scandal, and if the papers dig up her brother-
He didn't poison that girl.
The Italian courts acquitted him.
I know. But there were cocktails involved in that case too.
Can't you see what the newspapers will do to that?
Like brother, like sister.
How is he, Doctor?
It was a heart attack?
I'm sorry.
Mr. Gleason's death indicates poison.
The autopsy will tell us the truth.
Autopsy? Here?
Doctor, isn't there some way of hushing up this man's dying in my house?
I'm afraid it has to be reported to the police.
Walter, you're my lawyer.
Get me out of this.
I don't know. What you ask
Dr. Retling to do is highly unethical.
- Quite.
- I'll make it worth your while.
I'm sorry, Mr. Manderley.
Wait a minute.
Here's a possibility.
Doctor, if you saw the body in a hotel in town... couldn't you say he died there?
It will save my wife and me a great deal of pain and embarrassment.
We could take Gleason to the hotel at Mojave Wells.
I'll make it worth your risk.
No one knows of his death yet except the three of us.
No one need ever know.
Gee, it's great to be back in San Francisco again.
Boy, I don't think
I'll ever walk again.
They must have marched us a million miles.
Why do they have to walk so much in the army?
Excellent training for brains of all young sprouts.
How do you figure that?
Man who walk have both feet on ground.
Yes?
Gee, I thought
I'd never get my leave.
One week off for good behavior.
Say, Pop, what's this auto trip you got planned for us?
You know something, Pop?
What I'd like now is the relaxation of a good murder case.
Urgent letter threaten to cancel pleasure trip with number two son.
Huh? Who's it from?
Letter signed
Mrs. Paul Manderley.
Formerly Princess
Lucrezia della Borgia.
Lucrezia Borgia?
The poisoner? Oh, but she's dead.
- This lady use typewriter.
- What does she want?
"Dear Mr. Chan.
"Your presence is most urgently requested at
Manderley Castle for assistance and advice.
My life is in danger."
A case! Oh, boy.
What a break for me.
"Do not communicate with me.
"A car will await you each day at noon at Mojave Wells, California.
"This note bearing my crest will identify you to my chauffeur.
Bring no one else."
She's crazy.
You can't go there alone.
Say, what is this castle anyway?
Have heard of strange castle in desert owned by scholarly millionaire.
No electricity.
No telephone.
No phone?
Borgias. Poisoners.
Say, Pop, I don't like the looks of this.
- You'll need me.
- No. Letter says bring no one else.
Well, but suppose you have to call for help.
Number two son is nursemaid to flock of pigeons.
Parent will borrow one for emergency S.O.S.
But, Pop, you can't do that.
They belong to the Signal Corps.
I'm supposed to release 'em for test flights on our auto trip.
Will do same.
"United States Army... carrier pigeon number 13576."
Prefer briefer name.
Ming Toy-
"Daughter of Happiness."
But, Pop, that's a boy pigeon.
Ming Toy temporary alias while on case.
- If you take it, I'm going with you.
- Uh-uh.
But I'll be court-martialed if I lose him.
Uh, guardhouse excellent guarantee for offspring's whereabouts.
Coo, coo, coo, coo.
Coo, coo, coo.
This here's the Mojave Wells Hotel.
Nice place. Best in town.
- Perhaps only one in town.
- Yeah. Clean rooms though.
Never needs exterminator man.
- My brother-in-law here runs it.
- That's me.
Oh, a chop suey salesman, huh?
Well, don't try and sell me.
I hate the stuff.
Uh, interruption, please.
Has motorcar arrived yet from Manderley Castle?
Is that where you're goin'?
You're crazy to go out there.
Offer me a million dollars and I wouldn't go.
Thank you so much, but I'm expecting castle car conveyance at noon.
You'll be sorry.
Oh, no, you don't.
You can't bring bad luck to my hotel.
We don't want nobody that does business with the castle.
She's put a curse on us.
- Who, please?
- Mrs. Manderley.
She's a queer number.
At least, her doctor says so.
And her husband goes around town with half a face.
- Won't talk civil to nobody.
- Hmm. Uh, please.
Desire to await castle automobile here...
- in shade of porch.
- No.
No. You better get used to the heat.
It's 35 miles to the castle.
You can fry an egg on that highway at noon.
Already have sensation of fried egg.
Hi, Lizzie.
You have enemies, mister.
Man without enemies like dog without fleas.
I see death reaching for you, like an arrow.
Desert without Indians very safe.
Leave the desert.
Death waits for you out there.
Go back where you came from- unless you're prepared to die.
Man who fears death die thousand times.
It's your life.
But remember, I warned you.
You keep away from here.
Don't park in front of my hotel.
One moment, please.
Driver of automobile.
- I am expected at castle in desert.
- Yes, sir.
Don't try to come here again.
And tell that doctor not to bring you into my hotel to die... like he did that fellow last week.
Just a minute.
- Is this the car for Manderley Castle?
- Yes, sir.
If you're going there, you can get off my porch.
The crest of the Borgias- I was told it would get me transportation to the castle.
Very well, sir.
Most grateful for companionship on long desert journey.
You're the new cook or houseboy?
Lieutenant Chan, Honolulu Police, imitating weekend guest.
- Is that so?
- Yeah. Your name is, uh-
Watson King.
I specialize in minding my own business.
Very lonesome pastime.
Know who that second man was?
Checked in last night.
I never saw him before.
He'll die a violent death, he will.
And his murderer shall go unpunished.
- Ming Toy merely traveling companion.
- So I see.
You're responsible for the creature's behavior.
Fear unnecessary.
This bird perfect gentleman.
Trained by United States Army.
- I shall tell Mrs. Manderley you've arrived.
- Mm-hmm.
What are you doing here?
- Mr. Manderley?
- Yes. What do you want?
- Have request from honorable wife to visit castle.
- Well, who are you?
- Lieutenant Chan.
- Charlie Chan?
- Yes.
- The detective?
Well, why should my wife send for you?
Am also curious.
I don't understand.
Come into my study.
Charlie Chan!
Hello. How are you?
- Most happy to meet Mr. Detheridge again.
- You know each other?
Yes. Met back east.
Two years ago, wasn't it?
Young professor of medieval history... most helpful in solving difficult case.
You are employed at castle now?
No, just doing some research in
Manderley's rare books. I leave Monday.
Yes, Carl is the head of the European History
Department at Manderley College.
- House of learning built by honorable father.
- Mm-hmm.
- Carl, will you excuse us, please?
- Certainly, sir.
See you later, Charlie.
Let me know if I can help you.
Detective make visit merely as humble tourist.
Same old Charlie. He never gives out.
- Sit down, Mr. Chan.
- Thank you.
Now, Mr. Chan, be frank with me.
Tell me why you came here.
Merely respond to invitation from honorable wife.
And not to check up on my sanity... because of my peculiar mode of living?
You see, I had a rather serious accident.
My wife and I prefer the solitude of the desert.
I'm quite sound mentally.
I'm an historian.
Have read most distinguished work.
- Very heavy with pages of knowledge.
- Mm-hmm.
I pursue my research into the 16th century... by studying its books, its art... even putting up with some of the inconveniences- no telephone or electric light.
I want to understand the workings... of the minds of men who lived 400 years ago.
You wouldn't call that insane, would you, Mr. Chan?
To study Eskimo or African Pygmy... anthropologist must make their home his home.
I'm glad you appreciate my point.
I do that so that I can penetrate the psychology of the 16th-century mind.
I've tried to live and think as Cesare Borgia.
You see, he's the subject of my book.
- Honorable wife is descendant of famous Borgia family, no?
- Well, what of it?
What ifher name was Borgia?
She's just as sane as you are.
So am I.
Why, I'm the sole administrator of a $20 million estate.
An incompetent man couldn't do that, could he?
What is it, Doctor?
- Your sedative.
- Yes. Now observe me, as Dr. Retling does... and prove for yourself whether I'm sane or not.
You must take it now.
Oh, don't talk to me as if
I were a child, an incompetent.
My accident had nothing to do with my brain.
Here, I'll take this when I feel like it.
Mr. Chan, I believe.
I am Dr. Retling, the family physician.
You mustn't mind his outbursts.
He suffers from anxiety neurosis.
He dreads scandal.
You see, under his father's will... he loses control of the estate... if he's involved in any notoriety... that might dishonor the Manderley name.
Understand.
Last week, when Professor Gleason, the genealogist, upset him... he was behaving very peculiar.
Excuse, please.
What is nature of Mr. Manderley's accident?
An explosion.
Frightful scar, I hear.
You have not seen scar?
Nobody has, except the doctor who treated it.
That was years ago, and he has been very peculiar about it.
Accident did not affect his mind?
I prefer not to qualify as a psychiatrist, Mr. Chan.
Caution sometimes mother of suspicion.
Sorry to interrupt, but Mrs. Manderley would like to see you, Charlie.
Oh. Huh. Excuse, please.
Lucy, this is Mr. Chan.
Mrs. Manderley.
Wilson just told me you'd arrived, Mr. Chan.
Whatever brings you to our desert?
My husband hadn't told me you were coming.
Excuse, please.
Why, I didn't write this.
It's a forgery.
Whoever could have done such a thing?
Why, this isn't even the way I sign my name.
And it's not my idea of a practical joke.
I'm so sorry you've been put to all this inconvenience... but I didn't send for you.
Practical joke sometimes disguise for sinister motive.
- Oh, don't say that, Mr. Chan.
- So sorry.
With kind permission, will make quiet departure.
- Mrs. Manderley.
- Yes, Wilson?
Something most extraordinary.
The car has been damaged.
- Well, what happened?
- The distributor has been removed.
- What a silly thing to do.
- Well, if it's missing, find it.
- We've searched everywhere, sir.
- Thank you, Wilson.
- Keep on looking. It must be found.
- Very good, madam.
I refuse to believe that any of my guests would disable the car.
For what purpose?
Lovers use element of surprise.
Also criminals.
Criminals?
Well, what are we worrying about?
We can use Walter Hartford's car.
No. They came with me in a taxi.
Unless we have another visitor, we may not see another car for weeks.
And no telephone.
Inhabitants of this castle now marooned 35 miles from civilization.
Well, at least we won't starve.
Manderley has provisions for months, and an excellent wine cellar.
- I'm happy.
- Come on, Carl.
- Let's see about this distributor.
- Okay.
First you receive a mysterious invitation... and now we're all cut off from the outside world.
Why?
Detective sometimes summoned to witness crime.
That's an odd piece of reasoning.
Not if criminal hopes that finger of suspicion... point to innocent person.
With kind permission, will remain... to search for missing part of automobile.
- Of course.
- Even in baggage of guest?
- Oh, but they'd never think of doing-
- Hello, Lucy.
Hope you don't mind me getting here a day early.
Oh, no. No, not at all.
I see you've got everything ready for me.
Good quality too.
You are maker of images that mind own business?
Extraordinary deduction, Mr. Chan.
In a week this will be the head and shoulders of Mrs. Manderley.
- That's the commission, isn't it, Lucy?
- Sculptor is old friend?
Oh, yes.
Haven't seen each other in ages.
Not since you bought that figure of mine.
One of my best. Remember, Lucy?
Then she read about my New York show last month, so here I am.
By the way, Lucy,
I'm anxious to meet your husband too.
I've never had the pleasure.
Why-Why, yes.
That's right, Jim. You never have.
Correction, please.
Old friend Jim now known as Watson King.
Excuse.
Last stop.
All out for Mojave Wells.
Hey, Hank!
Got a customer for you.
Salesman, huh?
Oriental novelties or chop suey?
Give you a fine room.
Two bucks without breakfast.
I'm not stopping here.
Can I hire a car?
Sure, you can use mine.
Hey, you kids, get away from that car.
How many times have I told you?
- Where you goin'?
- Mrs. Manderley's castle.
Not in my car, you don't.
And you can't set foot in my hotel either.
But I've got to get out there.
It's a matter of life and death.
Hey, young fella.
- You got 25 bucks?
- Huh?
- Oh, oh, you mean you'll take me?
- Sure.
We won't get there till after dark, but I ain't afraid.
- Seventy miles, round trip.
- All I've got is $20, and I, uh-
- Oh, I'll trust you for the rest.
- Okay, let's hurry.
I couldn't help overhearing, mister... so I'm going to the castle with you.
There's death out in that desert.
Huh? What do you mean?
I mean, how do you know?
The stars.
They tell me everything.
- In the daytime?
- No. At night.
Say, where's the castle?
I don't see any.
Can't miss it, sonny.
Just follow this road about two miles.
I don't go no closer.
Hey, wait a minute!
- I knew he'd do that.
- Well, why didn't you tell me?
We'll be much better off alone.
I still don't see the castle.
- It's just over that hill.
- Wait. I'll take a look.
Oh, there it is.
Come on.
- Fourteenth century.
- Yes.
- Admirable collection you have here.
- Well, thank you, Mr. Chan.
It's taken me a great many years to assemble it.
Mr. Manderley?
Yes? What is it?
We found this man on the prowl outside.
I took his gun.
- Who are you?
- Fletcher. Arthur Fletcher.
I was hunting and I lost my bearings.
Stop searching me.
You're a trespasser.
Well, he looks harmless.
- You're a private detective, Mr. Fletcher.
- Anything wrong with that?
Wait outside.
What do you want here?
What makes you think
I want anything?
First Mr. Chan and then you.
Why are you here?
Well, I might as well come clean.
I was on my way to see you when my car broke down.
I represent Professor Gleason's family.
Yes? Go on.
They aren't satisfied about the way he died.
What do you mean?
He had a heart attack in the hotel.
- That's what your doctor said.
- What are you driving at?
The Gleason doctor said there was something peculiar about the condition of his skin.
It suggested poisoning.
Maybe he was sick while he was here, or he ate something-
Professor Gleason didn't stay here for dinner.
- He died in Mojave Wells, you know.
- I'm not so sure.
Well, you can question Dr. Retling.
He'll be down in just a moment.
I'd like to very much.
I have notes on
Professor Gleason's death right here.
Uh, may examine, please?
As Mr. Manderley's legal representative...
I don't like your attitude, Fletcher.
- You seem to be accusing him.
- I'm not accusing him of anything.
I'd like to speak to Mrs. Manderley.
I understand she had a brother who was tried for poisoning a girl.
Mind you, I don't say it runs in the family... but it's my job to check every angle... and satisfy myself that Professor Gleason didn't die in this house... or I'll have to ask the police to step in.
I'm Mrs. Manderley.
I couldn't help overhearing what you said.
- I'm sorry if I offended you.
- Oh, I understand.
And I'll answer all your questions after dinner.
Will you be our guest,
Mr. Fletcher?
- Why, thank you, but-
- That's quite all right.
And I promise not to poison you.
- Wilson?
- Yes, madam?
- There'll be another guest for dinner.
- Very good, madam.
Shh!
- Wait here for me.
- But I've got to get to my pop.
Wait here.
Shh!
Ow!
Who's there?
Is anybody down there?
Paul, we're waiting for you.
Coming, dear.
I thought I heard someone in the dungeon.
Brenda, please. That organ won't run away.
I'll be right there.
In olden times, the unexpected guest... was always made welcome with the first glass of wine.
- Mr. Chan?
- But lady of house always taste same first.
Thank you.
For Mr. Fletcher.
Thank you.
I'd like to propose a toast to Paul Manderley- reincarnation of Cesare Borgia.
- May his book be a great best seller.
- Thank you, Walter.
When will the book be out,
Mr. Manderley?
I'm not sure.
Perhaps three or four years.
Ooh.
Fletcher, are you ill?
- Cup of welcome contain evidence of powerful drug.
- Poison?
Are you sure?
- We'll have to notify the police.
- Impossible.
No motorcar. No telephone.
In my house-
First Gleason, now Fletcher.
- It can't be.
- Poison.
Hey, Pop!
- The old witch did it.
- Excuse, please.
Intruder is number two son, Jimmy Chan.
Vacationer from army.
How you get here?
- I fell into the cellar.
- From San Francisco hotel?
Say, Pop, somebody wants to kill you.
This letter- it came after you left the hotel.
- What does it say?
- Um, payment due on icebox.
Huh? Oh, I get it.
Look, Pop, I've got this case all figured out.
I was listening.
There's a roomful of poison downstairs, and somebody up here helped himself.
- That's preposterous.
- Uh, please, may see poison ring on finger?
- This is coat of arms of Cesare Borgia?
- Yes.
Hmm.
Poison compartment not used recently- perhaps not for centuries.
Uh, suggest ladies may retire.
- Men, please, will remain.
- But I tell you, Pop, the old witch did it.
- What are you raving about?
- Madame Saturnia! She was down in the poison room.
- That stargazer? Why, she's not here.
- But she came with me.
- I saw her.
- One moment, please.
Observations of expensively educated offspring sometimes very good.
- May see poison room, please?
- Yes.
Unpleasant thought, but obvious- one of us who sat down to dinner is a murderer.
They say poison is a woman's weapon.
Not always, Doctor.
Every 16th century castle had its own apothecary or alchemist.
- But not chamber devoted to a hundred poisons.
- Oh, yes.
I study them as Cesare Borgia did.
I wouldn't tell you that, Mr. Chan, would I, if I had a guilty conscience?
Guilty conscience like dog in circus- many tricks.
Oh, these old poisons have only been used on gophers, rats and coyotes.
Contradiction, please.
Content from this bottle put Mr. Fletcher to sleep.
But that's not a poison.
Am aware of same.
Old Chinese herb doctor use tagara weed as drug.
Too much of anything can kill.
Excuse, please.
You give desert pests large diet of deadly nightshade?
No.
- Much absent from bottle. - Well, there wasn't much to begin with- only two ounces.
Less than quarter ounce remain.
Somebody has stolen enough poison to kill all of us.
Would suggest you keep laboratory door locked.
Come.
Hey, Pop. Look!
I knew it.
I knew I couldn't hide from you.
What are you doing out here?
Did my wife send for you?
The stars sent me, to help you and your wife destroy those incriminating bottles.
No poisons, no evidence.
But you came too soon.
Why you wish to remove evidence?
To keep death from my friends' house.
Suppose death have strike already?
Impossible. The finger of Isis has never touched this house.
That's where you're wrong, lady.
Two men have been poisoned here.
My stars never lie.
No one has died under this roof... yet.
Friend of stars may possess unusual wisdom.
Come.
Just watch out for an arrow,
Mr. Chan.
There's one marked for you.
Man cannot avoid destiny.
- Most unusual lady.
- Yeah. She tells fortunes for my wife. She's quite harmless.
Collection of ancient instruments of torture- innocent hobby?
Well, not exactly.
Just more research.
In order to understand Cesare Borgia's mind,
I created a dungeon similar to his.
Men of the Renaissance often resorted to torture in order to maintain their power as rulers.
Evil habit still linger in Europe.
Dr. Retling... you are familiar with root of tagara weed?
Vaguely. Isn't that what
Friar Lawrence gave toJuliet?
The old chemists used it for insomnia cases.
You have seen same in
Mr. Manderley's laboratory?
- I'm the only one who ever uses that room.
- Listen here, Mr. Manderley.
With the door wide open, anybody could use that room- even your wife!
What do you mean?
Gee, I'm sorry.
Please, excuse number two son rudeness.
That's quite all right, Mr. Chan.
Look, Pop!
Fletcher's body- it's gone!
Hartford and Detheridge removed it to the chapel.
Gave no orders for same?
Mrs. Manderley sent down word to do it.
Uh, excuse.
- I must speak with Lucy.
- One moment, Mr. Manderley.
I'm afraid the time has come for dropping pretenses.
- What do you mean?
- Protecting your wife.
- Why?
- I know what I am talking about.
You are protecting a homicidal maniac who poisoned Gleason and Fletcher.
I dare to say it because I know what the scandal will do to you when it breaks.
Have her committed now, quietly.
Mr. Chan...
I'm sure you will help us.
Have no evidence
Mrs. Manderley poisoned Mr. Fletcher.
Have no evidence
Mrs. Manderley poisoned Mr. Fletcher.
We hushed up one death for Manderley's sake.
We can't do it again.
I tell you, she did kill them.
- Motive, please.
- She's mad.
She wants the emotion
Lucrezia Borgia knew... when she saw her enemies die at her dinner table.
- I know what I'm talking about.
- Oh, stop, Doctor. Stop!
I can't do what you ask. But I'll take her away with me- anywhere- to hush this up.
Hartford could take charge of the estate.
Send him to me.
I'll give him power of attorney.
Mr. Chan, can we count on your silence?
But, Pop, it's murder!
Sometimes solution to murder problem does not require scandal.
Thank you.
I'm sure it won't go unappreciated.
One moment, please.
Excuse.
- Liquid inoculated with missing nightshade.
- What?
Gee, now somebody wants him out of the way.
May see ring, please?
Thief of poison insert same here while ring rest upon table.
What's this?
Someone tried to poison Manderley?
Yeah. Unless he put it there himself.
For suicide, accidentally on purpose.
- Oh, nonsense.
- Don't be silly. We know who it was.
She can't help herself.
Mr. Hartford.
You're quite wrong, old man.
Mrs. Manderley isn't mad. But you are.
You'd better mind your own business.
Don't be childish.
Sorry. I didn't think the old thing would work.
Like poison, that won't get you very far either, Hartford.
Then you know.
Mr. Manderley sure is one scared man.
Guess I'd be too if I had a wife like that.
Glamour boy who jump to conclusions sometimes get hair mussed.
- You mean, she isn't crazy?
- Killer we seek very sane.
What you gonna do, Pop?
Send messenger for help from police.
Oh, my pigeon.
Look at him!
Dead pigeon.
Hope we are not same.
Nightshade gather
Ming Toy to ancestors.
Killer very sane.
Also thorough.
Whoever it was probably searched this room too.
Excellent deduction for expensive college education.
That was meant for you, Pop.
Obvious not meant for pigeon.
Madame Saturnia said that an arrow would get you.
Message from stars most accurate tonight.
Invited to witness one elaborate crime, parent interrupt another.
Wh-What do you mean?
Theory here much safer than theory there. Come.
But, Pop, I wanted to tell you about that sculptor, Watson King.
- Yes?
- He isn't the real thing.
He doesn't work the way they did in my art class. He's a fake.
One moment, please.
Inform editor.
Gee. Wrong again.
Go help parent by watching body of Mr. Fletcher.
Okay. What?
Body must be kept under close observation. Go.
- A-All by myself?
- Yes. Hurry, please.
All right.
Mrs. Manderley does not sleep.
Breathing reveal lady imitate possum.
Please.
Younger brother, Prince Borgia, once tried for murder?
He- He was my stepbrother.
He wasn't a Borgia.
He had no right to the family name.
- Where is he, please?
- Dead.
He was killed in the Spanish War.
No.
He was not killed.
He is among the living.
Stars say so?
- Why she hide here?
- She was frightened, Mr. Chan.
She's been with me ever since she left you.
- Stepbrother's face carry bad scar.
- Yes.
He had a serious accident when he was seven.
Oh, Mr. Chan. Why are they trying to make Paul think I'm mad?
- Twenty million dollars.
- But I don't understand.
Pop! Pop!
Pop? Pop! Pop! Pop!
- Please. Please. Please.
- Pop! Oh, Pop.
"Pop, Pop, Pop."
Why does offspring imitate outboard motor?
Fletcher's body- gone!
Disappeared! Somebody's taken it.
Mr. Fletcher's body like missing part of automobile- not far away.
Go back.
Make intensive search.
- Huh? You talk as if it got up and walked away.
- Not impossible.
Say, Pop, you haven't been drinking, have you?
Only wine of discovery. Go below.
- Keep watch. Have no fear of ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Are you soldier or mouse?
- Mouse.
Go on.
Mrs. Hartford, Dr. Retling- desire presence, please.
- Where is husband?
- Why, uh, I never keep track of him.
Come with me.
I'm sorry, Lucy.
This is Chan's idea.
Why are you disturbing
Mrs. Manderley this way?
To enlighten cruelly maligned lady.
Forged letter from you,
Mrs. Manderley... summon Chinese detective to castle.
Mrs. Hartford, your husband wrote same.
Why do you say that?
Mr. Hartford's notes on Gleason death... written on same machine...
- as letter bearing Mrs. Manderley's signature.
- Really!
But Mr. Hartford is my husband's attorney.
True. But he also desire control of vast estate... now competently managed by Mr. Manderley.
- What do you mean?
- Fake murder plot... and fake threat of newspaper scandal... created to terrorize millionaire husband... into giving Mr. Hartford power of attorney.
That's ridiculous, Mr. Chan.
Humble self invited to castle to prove you insane... but proof only point to conspirators.
Are you accusing my husband of killing Mr. Fletcher?
Mr. Fletcher not dead- nor Professor Gleason.
Both very much alive.
What did I tell you?
Gleason and Fletcher hired by doctor and lawyer to imitate death.
Each receive drink from you,
Mrs. Manderley... and insert into same drug from tagara weed... which suspend pulse of life for short period.
The potion Juliet drank.
Why would they do such an awful thing?
To make husband think you give poison in madness.
But odor of drug on Mr. Fletcher's glass... betray use of same to humble nose.
Nonsense.
Where did he get the drug?
It's very rare.
You obtained same from dungeon laboratory.
You can't prove that, Mr. Chan.
When Professor Gleason prove alive... can doctor explain false death certificate?
- Why, I-
- Well, no one was harmed.
- What can you do about it?
- Fraud is crime.
And murder punishable by execution.
Well, all right.
So my husband tried something and failed.
- But no one was murdered.
- Not yet.
- What do you mean?
- There is person in this castle... desire death of Mr. Manderley.
What for?
Widow would become very wealthy woman.
- Those words hold great truth, Mr. Chan.
- Oh, no.
My husband couldn't profit by that.
- But you and your stepbrother could.
- Cesare is dead.
Oh, no, he isn't. He wrote to Walter a month ago asking for money.
The stars never lie.
Can explain resurrection of stepbrother?
No. They told me he was dead- killed in action.
I- I believed it.
You are sure you do not know where your husband is?
Uh, no. Perhaps he left with Mr. Fletcher.
Across desert on foot?
He was frightened when poison was found in Mr. Manderley's ring.
We knew then that there was a real killer in our midst.
Return to rooms. Lock doors.
No one safe now. Come.
Jimmy?
Jimmy?
Jimmy!
It's only me, Pop.
Why does number two son inhabit hardware?
That fellow with the bow and arrow-
I'm not taking any chances.
There's an outfit for you too.
What has canned outpost observed?
- Nothing. But I don't mind watching now.
- Mmm.
Must investigate servants' quarters.
Remain in can.
Pop! Help!
Help!
- You still alive?
- Why, I guess so.
Just bent, bruised and bewildered, eh?
Oh, Pop! Hey, Pop!
As usual- hear earthquake... and naturally expect to find number two son responsible.
I was watching him and Madame Saturnia when I was pushed.
- Where is lady stargazer?
- Jimmy's downfall scared her away.
Who opened door to poison room?
The old lady- picked the lock like a professional. I didn't let her go in.
Mr. King, you were following her.
Part of my job.
Los Angeles Detective Agency.
This'll identify me.
I knew you'd find out sooner or later.
English sculptor formerly of Scotland Yard.
- Now with the Brewster Agency.
- Mmm. Have met head man.
- Who engage you?
- Mrs. Manderley.
- What reason?
- You'll have to get that from her.
Thank you. At present, am concentrating on whereabouts of missing lawyer.
- So am I.
- Say, Pop, I hope he don't show up dead.
- I'll look in the cellar.
- You examine laboratory.
Mr. Hartford?
- Why you hide?
- Somebody tried to kill me.
- Who?
- I don't know.
Somebody shot an arrow at me out in the courtyard. Just barely missed.
- Why didn't you call for help?
- Who was there to help me in this madhouse?
He doesn't think much of you, Pop.
Who else visit dungeon tonight?
Just the old lady and King, as he said.
Your wife and Dr. Retling already admit conspiracy against Mr. Manderley.
Now real killer seek your life.
If nobody knows you're down here, you're safe. Isn't he?
Only stars know answer.
I'll stay in hiding until you find out who it was.
The one who put the poison in Manderley's ring, obviously.
Huh. Will investigate upstairs. Come.
Say, Pop, I've got a theory.
Maybe Dr. Retling is double-crossing Hartford- or his wife is.
Theory like thunderstorm- very wet.
- I agree with you, Mr. Chan.
- Hey, Pop, look!
An arrow from a crossbow.
Most odd that force of impact should break arrow.
It could've been shot from the great hall... or from the door the old lady ran out of.
Most difficult angle, but possible.
Must question everyone immediately.
Come.
Mr. Manderley, please.
- May see weapon?
- It was on the table.
Yes. Hartford was demonstrating its uses while I was working on that bust.
He very nearly got me.
It might've been an accident, but he knew I'd guessed what he was up to.
Most urgent killer be apprehended before death strike again.
May require assistance. Please summon
Mr. Detheridge and Mrs. Manderley.
Have you a gun, Mr. Chan?
You'd better have mine.
It's gone.
My pocket's been picked.
Sharp wit sometimes much better than deadly weapon.
- I'll be right back.
- I'll go with you.
Say, Pop, is this-
Is this armor bulletproof?
Will soon find out.
Here. Put collegiate archery to practical use.
Secrete canned body in chapel and guard parent from rear.
I get it. When in the 16th century, do as the Romans do.
Oh, boy!
Am I hot with a bow and arrow.
Jimmy, please-
Remember, you are rear guard, not Cupid.
- Mrs. Manderley will be right down.
- Thank you.
Mr. Chan, how great is our danger?
Great as my determination to remove same.
Please. You recognize photograph?
Why, yes, of course.
That's my wife and her stepbrother.
He was killed in the Spanish War.
Stepbrother now in this castle.
Why, that's impossible!
- I don't believe it.
- This boy have peculiar scar on his cheek.
But same could be removed through plastic surgery.
What are you driving at? I'm the only one around here with a scar on his face.
Mr. Manderley,
I am about to make most unusual request.
- Yes, what is it?
- Please.
Desire to observe unfortunate scar you hide.
I'm sorry.
I can't grant that request.
Timid man never win lottery prize.
No scar. You lie to many people.
I had to, Mr. Chan.
It's hard to explain the seclusion that my work demands.
So I invented that mask as an alibi for my being a recluse.
Elaborate excuse seldom truth.
Paul, the scarf-
He's found out?
- Where is Mr. Detheridge?
- I couldn't find him upstairs.
Did I hear someone paging me?
Been out for a stroll.
There's a beautiful moon.
- Moon washed in blood.
- How do you mean?
Blood spilled by man with heart of ancient Borgias- ruthless, unscrupulous.
- That man kill lawyer Hartford.
- A third murder?
No. First and only murder.
Well, why should anyone kill Hartford?
He was obstacle on path to same goal-your estate.
How do you mean, Mr. Chan?
Killer came to castle.
He hope by causing
Mr. Manderley's death... to gain control of vast estates through innocent stepsister... but on arrival find his plan blocked by lawyer's plot.
Therefore he determined to kill lawyer first with arrow.
But who fired the arrow?
Arrow of death could not have been fired from crossbow... because shaft of arrow was broken.
Mr. Hartford not shot- he was stabbed.
Private detective agree?
Whom do you accuse?
Position of arrow in body indicate murderer to be left-handed.
Mr. Chan, I'm the only left-handed person here.
- Why, Lucy-
- Contradiction, please.
- King!
- Stand back!
Thank you very much, Mr. King, for instinctive admission of guilt.
Three other persons in castle also left-handed.
And what do you propose to do now, Mr. Chan?
Your assistance at this time,
Mr. Fletcher... may win forgiveness of the law.
Thank you so much.
Please decorate gentleman with legal jewelry.
And now will make humble effort to solve one more mystery.
Excuse.
Hidden distributor will release guests now marooned at castle.
Please return same to automobile.
Right away, Charlie.
Down. Steady.
No bones broken.
There you are.
The stars are your friends.
Only time can depend upon rear guard is when same is fast asleep.
- Remove hardware.
- I can't, Pop. It's all dented.
- I can't even move my head.
- Mmm. One moment. Excuse, please.
Much better?
Man who sit on tack better off.
Offspring sound like chip off old chopstick.
As I said before, the man who kills Mr. King will not be punished.
Ah. Executioner merely servant of law.
Perfect record for stargazer.
Mr. Detheridge, automobile being repaired?
- Yes. It'll be ready in 20 minutes, Charlie.
- Thank you so much.
Madame, now you will be able to ride-
Oh! Oh! Number two son hot again! Water!
Water. Water.
My name is Anne Blair.
My father was Dr. Julian Blair.
This was my father's house.
In Barsham Harbor,
on nights like this...
...when lightning rips the night apart...
...why do people close the shutters
that face towards my father's house?
And lock their doors and whisper?
Why are they afraid?
No one goes near my father's house.
No one dares.
I don't know where my father is.
I only know that for one
brief terrible moment...
...he tore open the door
to whatever lives beyond the grave.
...he tore open the door
to whatever lives beyond the grave.
Seven years ago, my father was
head of the science department...
...at Midland University...
...a few hundred miles
from Barsham Harbor.
My father was famous.
They were proud of him
at the university.
That night, five great scientists
came to my father's laboratory...
...to see something no one
on earth had ever seen before.
Finally ready to startle us, Dr. Blair? l don't blame you for being skeptical,
Professor Kent...
...but l assure you that all this is vitally necessary...
...for the demonstration l've invited you here to witness.
You will be the first people...
...with the exception of my wife and my assistant, Dr. Sayles...
...to see the proof that the human brain...
...gives off an impulse that can be recorded. l think we'd better close those blinds, Saunders.
Please watch the chart, gentlemen.
Dr. Sayles' brain is sending out the waves you see recorded on that chart.
And whether he speaks or is silent...
...or even if he tried to hide what he was thinking with meaningless words...
...his true thoughts would still be recorded on that chart.
-How did you reach that conclusion?
-Well...
...you will notice a repeated pattern in the variant waves, an exact rhythm...
...as though it were a carrier wave...
...on which the true thoughts were being transmitted. l think we better stop now.
-You feel any ill effects?
-Not at all, Dr. Saunders.
So that's a portrait of the mind of Dr. Sayles.
-Yes, Dr. Hart.
-A poor thing, but mine own.
-Seems incredible.
-Can you make a graph like that...
-...for any living brain?
-Oh, yes.
And each brain has its own wavelength...
...and they're as unlike as fingerprints.
Excuse me. l couldn't help it.
She said it was important.
-Helen!
-Don't blame Karl.
-You're not angry, are you?
-Of course not.
Come on in.
You know everybody here.
-Hello, Richard.
-Hello, Mrs. Blair.
-Good evening.
-How are you? l hope you'll forgive me for interrupting, but l know my husband so well.
When he gets started in the lab...
...he forgets about time and people and everything.
You have forgotten, dear, haven't you?
Anne is coming home this evening.
Anne is our daughter, and she's been visiting friends in New York.
Today's her 20th birthday. l remembered that.
-lf we don't hurry, we'll be late.
-Helen, wait a minute.
We've still got time. l was showing them the recording with Richard.
Now l'd like to show them your graph for comparison.
-But it's so late, darling.
-Oh, please, dear, it won't take a minute. l'm not really Julian's wife. l'm guinea pig number one for his experiments.
And l guess l still like it after all these years. l envy you, doctor.
-A wonderful wife for a scientist.
-For any man.
Thanks.
-Are you sure your hair isn't wet?
-No, no.
-Sure?
-Sure.
You reset the graph, please, Richard.
See how different the wavelengths are?
Why should this record be so much stronger? l don't know, but every demonstration that l've made so far...
...clearly shows the wave impulse of woman, the so-called weaker sex...
...is much stronger and is much more regular than man's.
Evidently, there's a greater natural power in the brain of woman.
-Any woman.
-Haven't l always told you that, Julian?
-Has Mrs. Blair's graph ever varied?
-The individual wavelength never varies.
Well, l believe what l can see.
Now tell me where you go from there.
Well, eventually, conceivably, we may be able to record and read...
...the thoughts of every human brain without a word being spoken.
You actually believe that someday you can push a button here...
...and read what l'm thinking in Chicago?
-You'll be able to read my thoughts too.
-lmpossible.
They called radio impossible, but all this that you see...
...is only the first step towards what we can achieve. lt may take years, perhaps a lifetime.
But if science can unlock the human mind...
...can uncover the secrets of every human brain...
...well, that's a job worth doing,
Professor Kent.
That's the first understatement l've heard you make. l'd like to show them the laboratory notes, Richard.
-l'll get them.
-Richard, get his coat.
-We've got to go.
-That's right. l'll have to leave you with Dr. Sayles.
-You see, l'm helpless.
-Sorry, gentlemen.
Good night.
-Do hurry, Julian.
-l'm sure we've got plenty of time, dear.
Richard, l forgot to turn off those switches. l'll take care of that.
-We'll see you at the house later.
-All right.
Come along, Julian.
Hurry up.
You know...
...l think l even convinced Professor
Kent, and that's a major triumph.
Darling, don't be a scientist anymore tonight.
You're asking an awful lot, but l'll try.
Say, aren't we going the wrong way for the station?
You've forgotten again, haven't you? l told you l was ordering a birthday cake for Anne's party...
-...with her name on it, remember?
-Oh, yes.
-l don't see how you put up with me.
-lt's because you're you. l don't see anywhere to park, do you?
Run out and get the cake, and l'll drive around and pick you up.
And hurry, dear. lt's almost train time.
-Come for the birthday cake?
-Yes, Mr. Booth.
Well, it's all ready for you.
-Okay, doc?
-You're an artist.
Well, l try to be, especially for nice folks.
Bet you and Mrs. Blair are happy to have the young lady back.
-lndeed we are.
-l'll carry it out for you.
-l wanna say hello to Mrs. Blair anyhow.
-Thank you very much.
Helen.
Helen.
I lost my mother that night.
And when she went away...
...I seemed to lose my father too.
He loved her so much.
I did all I could
to take my mother's place.
He didn't seem to know I was there.
He was lost.
Alone.
There wasn't anything
I could say to him.
There wasn't anything I could do. l'll get the car.
No, Richard.
You take Anne home. l want to walk for a while and think.
He went back to his laboratory
that night.
He went back to his laboratory
that night.
Alone.
He couldn't bear being in our house...
...where everything reminded him
of my mother.
Helen.
Helen.
Anne...
...for a moment, l thought that....
Father, what's the matter?
Anne, dear...
...your mother is not dead, not really.
She's come back to me.
No, dear...
...l haven't lost my mind.
She's here, here in this room.
She still lives.
Look. l can only tell you again... l can only tell you again...
...that when l turned on those motors...
...it was simply because l had to be doing something. l wasn't trying to reach my wife. l had no reason on earth to believe that l could reach her.
But she tried to reach me.
There is the proof of something the world has always wanted to believe.
The proof of life after death.
Richard. You of all people, you've worked with me.
You know how we believe that mind could talk to mind.
Well, now l know that there is a way for the dead to talk to the living.
My wife has passed through a change that we call death.
But the impulse that spoke from her living brain...
...that you saw me record on that chart, did not die. lf Helen could send me that message, and she did send it...
...then there must be a way to establish controlled and scientific...
...communication between the living and the so-called dead.
Do you really believe what you say?
Do you think l would invent a story like that about my wife?
How do you propose to go about establishing this communication?
Radio began with a first, faint, transmitted impulse...
...which no one knew how to control or harness.
Yet science found a way to send sound and speech...
...and living images clear around the world.
Well, l believe that the human brain, the brain that invented radio...
...is itself the most perfect sending and receiving mechanism on earth.
And l know that power does not end with the grave.
Don't you see?
We hold in our hand a key that may unlock the door...
...between us and those whom we call dead. lf we can set humanity free from fear...
...if we can show people that those we love are not lost to us...
...if we can wipe out the horror...
...that superstition conjures up out of fear of darkness--
Julian. l have too much respect for you to scoff at your hopes...
...to doubt your utter sincerity.
But what if you do find a way to pierce the veil between us and them?
And let the world of the dead back in upon the living?
We don't know what evil may be lurking behind that veil...
...waiting to get through.
What if you let loose on humanity...
...something much more terrible than any fear that haunts us now?
-But why should that happen?
-l know one thing, Julian.
There are things human being have no right to know.
There speaks fear, even from you.
Call it fear if you want to. l tell you, you must not go on with this.
Must not? ls there a wall beyond which science may not go?
-This is not science.
-Please don't argue.
Anne.
Don't argue with him, because he's not himself.
That's what's in your mind, isn't it?
You won't believe me.
You won't help me.
Poor, frightened little people.
Well, l don't need you. l don't need any of you.
Dad, won't you come home now and rest?
Then tomorrow, maybe you'll feel better.
Tomorrow.
No, Anne. l'm not some helpless child to be taken home for his own good.
Get out. Get out.
All of you.
Do you hear me, Anne?
Go home.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you for your great faith in me.
What do you want? l just wanna tell you you're right, doc. l know.
-What are you talking about?
-l know we can talk to the dead. l talk to my mama all the time.
She died two years ago, but l can still talk to her.
-How?
-Ever hear of Mrs. Blanche Walters?
She's a spirit medium.
Her control brings the voice to you from the beyond. l'm afraid mediums are no good to me, Karl.
You better go now, l've got work to do.
But, doc...
...it wouldn't hurt to see what
Mrs. Walters can do, would it?
No.
No.
That night, my father took another step
toward tragedy.
That night, my father took another step
toward tragedy.
Poor Karl wasn't to blame.
Perhaps no one was to blame.
I don't know.
But that night, my father
met Mrs. Walters...
...and then for him...
...there was no turning back.
There is one here who seeks his mother...
...who asks his mother to speak to him.
His name is C....
K....
Karl.
Karl seeks his mother. ls Karl here?
Here.
Here l am.
Karl.
Your mother is calling you.
Your mother is...
...with us.
Talk to me.
-l see you.
-Karl.
Karl, my son.
-l hear you.
-Karl.
Don't be unhappy. lt's very beautiful here. l am at peace.
There is no pain, no sickness, no sorrow. l am watching over you, Karl.
We will meet again...
...soon.
-Come back!
-No.
No, l can't.
They've gone. l can't find them.
Turn on the lights.
-Mrs. Walters, are you all right?
-l'll get some water. l'm afraid l can go no further tonight.
You will forgive me, now, won't you? l'm so tired.
-lt was wonderful, Mrs. Walters.
-An inspiration.
We'll see you next Tuesday.
Your hats and coats are in the hallway.
-You coming, doc?
-l'm going to talk to Mrs. Walters.
-You coming, doc?
-l'm going to talk to Mrs. Walters. l congratulate you. l've seen a lot of mediums at work...
...but l think yours is one of the smoothest performances l've ever seen.
You're not the first unbeliever l've met.
But other men of science have turned to the occult for surcease from sorrow.
Sir Oliver Lodge was a believer.
-So was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
-l know, Mrs. Walters.
But l am quite sure that l can duplicate every trick you've done here tonight. l hate to disillusion you, Karl...
...but there's your mother's ghost.
And the voice...
...came from...
...here.
There's just one thing more--
Get out of here, both of you.
Get out.
After you've explained one trick that's new to me.
How do you handle the wiring for that table?
What wiring? l experienced a severe shock during the séance, a dangerously high voltage. lt might prove fatal to some of your more elderly clients.
Are you crazy? l've never used electricity in a séance in my life. ls that the truth?
Why should l lie to you now?
What if that's true? lf that impulse...
...is really generated by your own brain...
...and your nervous system without your knowledge, then.... lf that's possible.
Mrs. Walters, l'd like you to come to my laboratory now. l'd like to make a test.
-Why?
-lt may be that you're closer...
...to a real communication with the dead than you ever realized. l'm not in this business for my health, Dr. Blair. lf you can help me in my work, you'll be well-paid. l'll get my coat.
I waited for my father at home
that night.
I waited for my father at home
that night.
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't know where he was.
And all the time, he was locked
up there in his laboratory...
...with Karl and Mrs. Walters.
All he could think of was
how to reach my mother...
...how to talk to her.
He thought Mrs. Walters
might be able to help him.
He wasn't sure,
but he had to find out.
And that...
...that was the beginning. l think you'd better take off that ring.
Stand back, Karl.
Are you afraid?
Now watch those lights.
Your brain and nervous system are producing an electrical current.
An incredibly high voltage.
Dr. Blair, l think it's time you told me what this is all about.
This is science, Mrs. Walters.
There's nothing of the occult about it. lf you can produce an electrical voltage as powerful as that...
...the next step is to see if you can absorb as much or more.
And if l can?
Then you may serve the same purpose...
...as the ground and aerials serve in radio sending and receiving.
But l can't be sure until l make a further test.
Karl, you can help me, if you will.
You can take that off now.
Let's move this out here, Karl.
Far enough. Over here, if you please, Mrs. Walters.
Stand back, Karl.
All ready?
Karl! l'm all right.
Do you realize that 2000 volts would electrocute the ordinary human being...
...but 1 0,000 passed through your body a moment ago without harming you? l believe l'm on the right track.
Let me show you something.
That wave, that impulse was recorded by my wife's brain before she died.
That was recorded after she was dead and buried.
That proves that that brain impulse still lives somewhere.
What has that got to do with me? l believe that if l could change the hookup on that recording machine...
...so that instead of recording your brain waves...
...l could utilize the energy output and receiving field...
...of an abnormally sensitized human being, like you, for instance. l could bring in that impulse so strongly that l could record it constantly...
...and perhaps learn to read its message.
Eventually, l may bring back my wife's actual voice...
...and show the world how to talk to those who have...
...passed beyond the grave. lf you can do what you're trying to do, you'll own the world.
You know that, don't you?
You sit down and rest for a while.
Then we'll see.
My father didn't come home.
I didn't know what to do.
Finally, I couldn't stand waiting,
wondering.
I had to find him.
I called Richard Sayles.
-Karl, do you want to help?
-Sure, doc.
Then get a chair and put it next to Mrs. Walters. Hurry. l'm going to add Karl to the circuit. lt may add to the receiving strength of the machines...
...just like adding radio tubes to a set. ln a little bit, Karl.
That's right.
Now sit down. lt's all right, Karl. lt's not going to hurt you.
Helen.
Helen!
Helen.
Helen.
Karl.
Help me.
-Who is that?
-l don't know.
We'd better not let anybody see him the way he is now.
No. l'll take care of him.
Go see who it is.
Dad, we've come to get you.
Do you know what time it is?
Of course.
Dad, come home. l thought l asked you not to bother me.
Doctor, l don't like to say this to you, but...
...well, people are talking about you.
And there's to be a report given at the university board...
...that...
-...well, that you....
-That l'm losing my mind.
Thank you for telling me.
Now will you leave me alone?
-Dad, please.
-Good night.
Look at Karl.
Karl. Karl. l'm afraid electric shock has injured his nerve centers, perhaps permanently.
The impulse had begun to come through. lt was Helen...
...and now Karl, like this.
The world can get along without him, and nobody has to know about this.
We can't hide him.
He has to have care. lf anyone sees him the way he is, the law will step in and stop you for good. l know.
Have you got enough money to leave this town and take Karl?
-What?
-We've got to get away from here.
Where you can go on working and no one will know.
Yes.
Yes.
The next morning,
my father sent me away to New York.
He resigned at the university.
He arranged to sell our house.
He said he was going away
that same day.
He wouldn't tell me where.
He said he'd write to me later
if he could.
He was like a stranger.
Someone I'd--
I'd never known.
And yet, he hadn't stopped loving me.
I know he hadn't.
Goodbye, Anne.
Goodbye.
I didn't see my father again
for two years.
Every three months,
he sent me a check.
He never wrote me a letter.
I wrote to him,
but he never answered.
He bought a strange house at Barsham
Harbor on the New England coast.
There, he went on with his work.
On and on and on.
People in Barsham Harbor
didn't understand my father.
They began to talk about him.
Slowly, they began to fear him
and then to hate him...
...without really knowing why.
Poison of hate
spread through the village.
No one would even speak to him...
...although he had never
hurt any of them.
You must remember that.
My father never hurt a living person
in Barsham Harbor.
Never.
-Why, Sheriff Ed.
-Evening, Mrs. Marcy.
What on earth you doing way out here?
Come on inside. l asked you what you're doing way out here.
-Oh, business, Mrs. Marcy.
-Sheriff business? ln a way.
Your husband around anywhere?
Seth Marcy ain't set foot on these premises...
...the two years l been working here, and swears he never will.
Seth don't like Dr. Blair.
From what l hear, he's not the only one that don't.
-You better call Dr. Blair.
-l wouldn't dare go near him.
-Why not?
-He's working in his laboratory. l got strict orders never to go near that place.
This is important.
Wouldn't matter if the world was ending tomorrow.
She wouldn't let you bother him.
-She?
-Mrs. Walters.
You seen her? l've heard of her.
Have you noticed anything peculiar going on around here? l make it my business not to notice what ain't my business.
How do you get along with that ape that follows the doc around?
Karl?
He's harmless.
He's like a big, ugly dog.
All you have to do is raise your voice to him, and he minds.
Hey...
...why haven't you got electric lights?
Mrs. Walters says they'd interfere with the reception.
-Reception of what?
-l don't know.
He's inventing some kind of radio, l guess.
You. Stand still.
Ed Willis, you put that gun away.
Karl, you stop.
Karl, you hear me?
Just like l told you.
Karl minds when he's spoken to.
What was that noise?
Some kind of static, l suppose, from the laboratory. l got used to it long ago.
-What do you want?
-l'd like to talk to Dr. Blair.
That's impossible. l don't think so.
Doc, do you want to come down here, or shall l come up?
Maybe l should explain that l'm sheriff of this county.
The name's Willis.
Ed Willis.
-l don't care who you are.
-How about it, doc?
You don't have to talk to him.
Might make things a lot better all around if he did.
Why?
An old settler named Sam Jennings...
...was buried in the family vault day before yesterday.
Well?
His body disappeared last night.
Why tell us about that?
Mostly because it's happened before.
Four times before.
Five bodies missing in the two years since you people came to this town.
And it never happened before you came to town.
Now, it's my job to find out who stole those bodies.
We don't know anything about it.
Ordinarily, l don't pay attention to what people say. l figure they've gotta talk about something.
But when a whole town begins to talk about...
...a connection between the missing bodies...
...and whatever it is that goes on in this house...
...well, l figure it's time l found out what is going on.
This is not the first time l've been the victim of people who talk...
...about things they're too ignorant to understand. l'm engaged in experimental work.
All right.
What kind of experiments?
That's none of your business. l think it is, under the circumstances.
Dr. Blair...
...l want you to take me to your laboratory.
Show me just what it is you are doing...
...tell me what it's all about.
Then l can go back to town and tell the folks.
Tell them you're okay.
And l'll make them quit talking before the talk goes too far.
Now, that's fair enough, isn't it? lt'd be impossible to explain to you what l'm doing, even if l wanted to. l believe l have the right to go on with my work without being put on trial by fools.
This is my house. l've committed no crime. Karl.
You will take this gentleman to the gate and see that he leaves. That's all.
Good night.
That's all for tonight.
-Good night, Dr. Blair.
-Good night, Mrs. Marcy.
That man will be back. l'll take care of him when he comes.
You'd better get some rest.
No, l think l'm going to work a little later tonight.
Good night.
Oh, it's you, Sheriff Ed.
-You scared me out of me year's growth.
-Sorry. l didn't turn on the headlights, in case anybody was watching. Come on.
Come on, get in. l'll drive you home.
You certainly caused plenty of excitement tonight.
How on earth could you practically accuse poor Dr. Blair...
...of stealing bodies?
Well, somebody stole them.
What's in that laboratory of his? l never been in it.
The door's always kept locked.
-Could you get in?
-And get caught and lose my job? l never was inquisitive, and l see no reason to be now...
...just to satisfy your curiosity.
Look, Mrs. Marcy. l'm not saying there's anything really wrong in that house.
But a lot of folks are thinking there is unless l can tell them differently.
You know, folks can talk just so long, and then there's an explosion.
And a lot of people get hurt. l don't want any mob trouble in our town.
Maybe you could help to keep that from happening.
Will you try? l never made a promise yet and didn't keep it.
So l ain't gonna promise you a thing...
...but l'll see.
Karl...
...l forgot to lock the laboratory.
Take care of it for me, will you?
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out!
Dr. Blair. Dr. Blair!
Dr. Blair! Dr. Blair! Dr. Blair!
Who's in there?
Where are the keys?
Stand back. ls she dead?
Yes.
-How'd she get in here?
-l forgot to lock the door.
Now l am a criminal, a murderer.
When she doesn't come home tonight, her husband will start looking for her.
-Then how? What?
-There's only one thing we can do.
They're here.
-Who?
-Seth Marcy and the sheriff.
You'll have to talk to them.
They won't leave unless you do. l've taken care of the footprints.
You'd better not keep the sheriff waiting too long, or he might come up here.
-Where's my wife?
-Easy, Seth.
-l can't tell you anything about her.
-She left here hours ago.
You're lying.
She's here in this house somewhere. l'd like to help you, but l can't.
How do l know she's not here?
What would she be doing here at this time of night?
You have time to help them look for her, haven't you, Dr. Blair?
Yes, l'll get my hat and coat.
Look where?
She always went home the same way, didn't she?
The path leads right along the edge of the cliff at one place. l know it does.
Come on, Seth. lt was dark when Mrs. Marcy left the house.
We asked her if she wanted a lantern, but she said she didn't need one.
She walked that path day or night, rain or shine, for two years.
She wouldn't have walked over here.
What did you do to her? l didn't do anything to her. l'm....
-l'm terribly sorry.
-Seth.
May l go home, please?
Yes, you might as well. l'd be glad to help to pay for the funeral expenses...
...in case you find--
Good night.
They've killed her.
Seth!
Now, l know how you feel...
...but l can't stand for you starting any trouble.
You've got absolutely nothing to go on...
...nothing but loose talk and superstition...
...and the fact that you never did like Dr. Blair.
Now, you go around talking too much and....
Well, l might just have to put a stop to it.
Go on home now, Seth.
Well, are they satisfied?
Why did you follow us?
We could honestly have said her death was accidental.
Now we've lied.
-We're as guilty as if we'd planned this.
-Stop talking like that.
Come on.
We can't stay here now.
Richard and I reached Barsham Harbor
very late that night.
The sheriff told us what he thought
had happened to Mrs. Marcy...
...and hinted much more than he said.
He told us Seth Marcy was telling
everyone my father had killed his wife.
The sheriff told us so much
we could hardly believe him.
My father had become
a very strange man.
While we were on our way
to his house...
...he was working
in that ghastly place.
Karl, go over to the other wall and fix your safety belt.
Stand back, please.
The sooner you take charge in there, the better.
Helen.
Look out, let me.
-You better stay down here, Anne.
-No.
Let me out. No. l can't stand it.
Julian.
Helen.
Stop. l can't stand it.
Julian.
Helen.
No, let me out.
Mrs. Walters.
Mrs. Walters.
Karl, don't open that door.
Anne.
Oh, Dad. l sent for her.
Told her she'd better come here and take care of you.
Dad, why didn't you answer my letters?
-Well, you never wrote me.
-But l did. l saw a letter at the post office myself.
That's how l knew where to get in touch with her.
But Mrs. Walters always-- l should have realized long ago.
You've done me a favor, a great favor.
There'll be no more trouble in this house...
-...now that my daughter is here.
-l'll be in touch later, sheriff.
All right.
Good night.
You'll find a lamp downstairs in the kitchen.
You'll be wanting something to eat, won't you? l'll come talk to you later.
-But, doctor, why--?
-l'll be down in a few minutes, Richard. l've got something to do. lt won't take me very long.
All right, Dad.
You'll have to help me, Karl.
Yes, she's dead. l thought you'd never get here.
Seth's got them worked up to where they're talking about lynching him.
Not tonight, Seth.
Now go back home where you belong.
-You ain't stopping us, Ed.
-l will. lf l have to use this.
-Now, l'm warning you.
-Attaboy, Joe.
Hold him. Come on, men.
-You can't stop them now.
-Come on.
No, Karl.
Come in, Richard.
Come in, Richard.
Doctor, are these...?
Now you know why l couldn't bring the sheriff in here. l never meant to kill anybody, Richard.
And as soon as the work is finished, l'm going to give myself up.
Richard, we must go on with the work. We are both scientists.
You and Anne can help me.
Do you think l'd let Anne have anything to do with this?
Helen spoke to me tonight. l actually heard her voice. l found out something l should've known...
...something l should've realized a long time ago.
Every time Helen's tried to speak to me since she died...
...Anne has been somewhere near.
-What are you trying to tell me?
-Anne is the key.
Don't you understand, Richard?
The impulse that belongs to Anne is almost identical with her mother's.
Their minds are in tune.
Tonight...
...for the first time, l heard Helen's voice.
And now with Anne to help me, perhaps l can talk to her.
Do you think l'd let you put Anne in that?
Richard, she'll be perfectly safe.
-l won't let you touch her.
-Oh, Richard.
Don't try to stop me now.
Trust me. Help me.
Richard. l'm going to take Anne out of this place.
Maybe l can keep her from knowing about this.
Richard, Anne cannot leave.
Anne cannot leave.
Karl! Don't touch him.
He isn't badly hurt.
You better take him to my room.
And that's all!
Anne, dear, l'm not going to hurt you. ln a few moments, we may hear your mother's voice.
We're very close to your mother now, dear. l feel sure of it. l've got to use more amplification than l've ever used before, but don't be afraid.
You'll feel something pulling at you, dragging you towards the table...
...but l won't let that force hurt you. lf there's any danger, you can trust me to turn it off.
Julian.
Julian.
Helen!
Julian.
Julian.
Julian.
Helen.
Helen!
He's upstairs in his laboratory.
Get out of the way, you.
-Come on, boys!
-Get him!
Helen.
Anne!
Anne. Anne!
Anne, are you hurt?
Anne!
They say my father's spirit
must still live in that house.
I don't know.
When he seemed to be so close
to what he sought...
...something reached out for him.
A warning that human beings
must not try to reach beyond death.
I don't know.
No one will ever know.
And yet, perhaps the time will come
when the door to infinity will open.
Perhaps.
Perhaps.
Before our god, Amon-Ra... you are Yousef Bey... son of Abdul Melek?
I am, O Father.
I have answered your summons.
You are prepared to undertake a mission?
I am.
And to live your life... according to the pattern decreed... by the Priests of Arkam?
I am.
Hear then.
Three thousand years ago... lived the Princess Ananka... and a young man, Kharis.
They dared to love each other.
But Ananka was a priestess initiate of Arkam... and such a love was forbidden.
The princess died... her soul cursed forever.
Kharis was buried with her.
Then...
30 years ago...
An expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka.
Managing to escape the guarding mummy... they brought Princess Ananka's body here to America.
It is now a choice possession of the Scripps Museum.
This, however, did not end the matter.
The secret cult, the Priests of Arkam... smuggled the monster Kharis into this country... right into our own vicinity,
Mapleton.
He was turned loose... and every living member of the party... who had dared set foot into that faraway tomb... died by his hands.
The monster itself was later consumed in the flames of the Banning house.
Thus ended the reign of terror, which had its origin centuries ago.
Professor Norman.
Yes?
I know the papers said the mummy really lived and...
That's right.
But it's incredible.
Maybe it was a man made up as a mummy, to keep the legend alive.
I saw the creature.
I analyzed the mold found on the wrappings about his body.
I saw him moving around, and so did hundreds of other people.
Yes, Miss McLean?
Wasn't he kept alive... by the fluid from some sort of leaves?
He was.
Tana leaves.
They grew from a low bush found centuries ago in Central Africa.
It's extinct now.
A quantity of them was found among the effects of Professor Banning... the man who first discovered the mummy's tomb.
The authorities gave me permission to take them for scientific research... but how they could preserve life indefinitely is still a mystery.
If Banning knew the solution, the secret died with him.
But the laboratory has solved mysteries before.
And perhaps someday...
Which brings us to the end of our discussion.
I assure you that in our next class... we will concern ourselves solely with the history of Egypt... and not with the more lurid... and non-curricular subJect ofliving mummies.
Good afternoon.
Tom, coming out for practice tomorrow?
Yep.
What do you make of all this Egyptian mummy stuff that Norman's dishing out?
I don't make anything of it.
It's out of my line.
Maybe your girlfriend could throw a little light on the subject.
You're crazy. How would Amina know any more about it than you or I?
Isn't she Egyptian?
Her ancestors were.
Your ancestors used to live in caves... so maybe you can tell us where to find the missing link.
Don't get angry now.
If she was my girlfriend,
I'd ask her.
She isn't, so don't bother.
Hi there, Peanuts.
You been a good boy today?
Missed your poppy.
Didn't you?
That demonstration is gratitude for leaving him in my company all afternoon.
Which proves that his judgment and taste are as good as his master's.
Isn't it about your quitting time?
In a few minutes.
What's this?
Hmm, The Tombs of Ancient Egypt.
Norman would be interested in these.
You should've heard him this afternoon.
Gave us an eyewitness account... of that 3,000-year-old
Egyptian mummy... wandering around here strangling people.
What's wrong?
Nothing. L...
What is it, Amina?
Why do you always get jittery if I mention anything about Egypt?
Please, Tom, do we have to talk about it?
Why not? You're Egyptian.
That makes it important and interesting to me.
But whenever I speak of it, you freeze up.
I know. I can't help it.
Something happens to me when I think of Egypt.
What's wrong with Egypt, darling?
It's as modern as any other country.
I know all that, but...
Please, if you don't mind,
I'd rather not talk about it.
All right, darling.
I'm sorry.
You ready to go?
Yes.
I have to take these books to Professor Norman.
Amina, what's wrong?
I don't know.
I feel so tired all of a sudden.
You're working too hard, and I upset you with my talk about mummies.
I'll take these books over for you, and you go get some rest.
However, that doesn't mean
I'm letting you off our date tonight.
Come on, Peanuts.
The world believes it has destroyed Kharis... but through the sacred message brought to us... by the most holy spirit of Amon-Ra... we know that he still lives.
Kharis still lives?
Lives only for the purpose for which he was created:
To guard Ananka's tomb... until the end of time.
Your mission... is to bring him back to Egypt... and, with him, Ananka, his beloved princess.
Now swear... by the ancient gods of Egypt... that you will never rest until the Princess Ananka and Kharis... have been returned to their rightful resting places... in these tombs.
I swear... by the mighty power of Amon-Ra... whose anger can shatter the world... and by the dread horror of Set... that I shall never forsake my trust... as a Priest of Arkam.
Nor shall I rest... until the Princess Ananka and Kharis... are safe once more... in the hills of Arkam.
Once each night... during the cycle of the full moon... you will brew nine tana leaves.
Kharis will know and come for the fluid... which preserves him.
He will find it wherever it is.
I have it.
I have it.
By heaven,
I believe I have it!
Good. Then you'll come to bed, won't you, dear?
But it's late.
You just said you finished.
No, I found the means to finish.
The key to the locked door, I hope.
This was the lock.
This one elusive hieroglyphic.
And here I've found the key.
What on Earth does it say?
It says nine.
Is that all?
That may be everything.
All right.
Then you come to bed.
It will still be nine tomorrow night, won't it?
Yes, but tomorrow night the moon will not be full.
That's part of the story these tell also.
Nine tana leaves must be brewed during the cycle of the full moon.
Whatever has the full moon to do with it?
Oh, it's...
It's ridiculous.
Yes, it sounds that way, doesn't it?
But how are we to be certain?
The moon affects the tides.
It may have the power to affect these tana leaves as well.
I don't know.
It's all too much for me.
That's my salvation, Ella:
That you're not a scientist, and that it is too much for you.
Run along to bed and don't worry about me.
All right.
Norman's dead.
Murdered.
What?
Yeah, it happened sometime last night.
I can't believe it.
It's all over the campus.
The sheriff s at Norman's house now.
Tom, Amina's mixed up in it too.
Amina?
A watchman picked her up unconscious outside Norman's house this morning.
It's only logical they'd suspect...
What's logical about it?
What does it look like, coroner?
Strangulation.
There are traces of a foreign substance on the throat.
That's mold.
The mummy.
I begged Matthew to come to bed last night.
I begged him, but he wouldn't listen to me.
He kept talking about keys and leaves and moonlight... and now he's dead... he's dead.
How do you feel now?
I'm all right.
Good.
Now you can tell us what you were doing outside this house last night.
No, I can't.
I don't know.
Do you usually go walking on the campus in your nightgown?
I don't know how
I got there last night or why.
Something happened here to make you faint.
What was it?
I don't know!
I don't know! I don't know!
Look, Miss Mansouri...
I don't want to get tough... but a man was murdered here last night.
I'm not saying you had anything to do with it... but you are in a hot spot.
A memory lapse won't help you out of it, so you'd better...
Where do you think you're going?
I want to see the sheriff.
Let him in, Joe.
Don't worry, honey.
Everything's all right.
She had nothing to do with this, Sheriff.
You can prove this?
Certainly.
She was with me last night.
For how long?
We went to the show and...
What time did you leave her?
It was around 11:00.
The murder took place after midnight.
That puts us back where we were before you came barging in here.
What did you do after this young man left you last night?
Can you remember that?
Oh, yes.
I went to bed almost immediately after Tom brought me home.
I fell asleep right away too.
And then, the next thing, I...
The watchman found me.
You'd better go home.
But don't leave Mapleton until I tell you.
You understand?
Yes. Thank you.
Come on, Amina.
I'll take you home.
What's the matter, Tom?
Nothing, dear.
Everything's going to be all right.
What did you draw, Ben?
Watcher, top of the court house,
9:30 to 12:00.
Well, I reckon you've got to do it.
We've all got to do what we can, Mrs. Evans.
I'm patrolling High Street from Sixth to Fourteenth.
All the money in the world wouldn't get me out tonight.
I remember the last time this happened. It was pretty horrible.
Almighty gods of Egypt... extend your shielding arm to me, your servant.
Protect me in this strange and foreign land.
Help me to dispatch with speed and glory... the mission I have undertaken in your name.
Bring Kharis to me.
Wherever he is... guide his steps into these hills where I await him.
Make him to know that I prepare again for him... the cup of life:
The sacred fluid of the tana leaves.
Tom, don't tell me you've run out of gas.
No, I just wanted to stop and look at you.
I haven't heard you laugh like that for weeks.
Yes,
I was laughing, wasn't I?
I didn't realize it myself.
It's wonderful.
I can laugh again.
That's the way it's going to be from now on.
No more of this nonsense of hearing voices out of the blue.
And going from chills to fever in the same day.
Right?
Right.
That makes it unanimous.
Now what?
I don't know.
I felt cold suddenly.
Is that better?
What makes him act like that?
He heard another dog bark, so he thinks he has to bark too.
Just showing off, that's all.
I wonder.
I love you, darling.
I love you too, Tommy.
Then, let me hear you laugh again.
What's the matter?
That-That shadow.
It's nothing.
Just your imagination.
Come on now. Relax.
Sorry if I scared you folks.
I was taking a shortcut home, and I tripped over a stump.
Thought I never would quit rolling.
That's too bad.
But you're on level ground now, so don't let us detain you.
Sure. Sure.
Good night to you.
Good night.
Now, you see?
You even had me going for a minute.
Take me home, Tom.
But you saw for yourself.
I know, but... Please.
All right, darling.
King! King!
What's the matter, boy?
Is that you, Ben?
Yeah, it's me.
It's about time. Too.
Old King's been carrying on like crazy.
I hear him.
Go back to bed, Martha.
All right, boy.
Take it easy.
Ben!
Ben!
It was no thief who killed Ben, Mrs. Evans.
And nothing human tore through that wall.
Sheriff.
Look at this.
If the mummy didn't make those prints, I'll eat them.
We'll get the rest of the men and comb this country inch by inch.
If you spot the mummy, don't try to mix with him.
Just keep him in sight until more help arrives.
Mighty Amon-Ra...
I thank thee for guiding Kharis to me... and for delivering us from the hands of those who would destroy us.
Grant me the wisdom and the skill to complete our mission... and to return the Princess Ananka to the tombs of Arkam.
Almighty Amon-Ra... thy will only is omnipotent.
Come, Kharis.
And that is the history of the Princess Ananka... the story of a disastrous love which started more than 3,000 years ago... and has endured through the centuries... to bring tragedy and death into the lives... of everyone connected with the opening of her tomb.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, follow me to the next room.
I'll tell you all about the exhibit which dates back to the 13th dynasty.
Almighty gods of Egypt... forgive us, the Priests of Arkam... powerless now to prevent the gaze of these heretics resting upon her.
May the reclamation of her body absolve us... from any laxity that may have been ours.
This is the Hour of Death.
The forces of evil stand at the threshold.
A man shall die tonight in this, the murder...
Did you ever meet a killer, my friends?
You will tonight.
A killer is at large tonight, my friends.
He enters the darkened study of Dr. X, the mad doctor of Market Street.
In the darkened shadows of the room, the doctor waits.
There's a scuffle, screams, gunshots, crash.
Amon-Ra, Isis, Osiris, help me.
Kharis.
The hour of fulfillment is at hand.
Behold her:
Ananka, the princess of your forbidden love.
The gods have been kind.
Beneath the sheltering wings of their protection... we have come to the end of our quest.
Kharis, the tombs of Arkam are waiting to claim their own.
Amon-Ra, almighty god, thy wrath is far-reaching.
By thy will, her soul has entered another form.
Kharis, stop!
The gods have chosen to make our task more difficult.
So be it.
In whatever form Ananka's soul has found refuge, it shall not escape us.
Our mission will be fulfilled.
Get away from that case.
I am a Priest of Arkam.
I fear only the great wrath of Amon-Ra... not the little angers of an infidel.
I'm warning you.
Amon-Ra!
Come, Kharis.
I don't know what happened.
I thought there was someone here in the room.
I could feel his hands... touching me.
You must have been having a nightmare. There's no one here.
Tom Hervey wants to see you, Sheriff.
Let him come in.
Good morning, Hervey.
What's on your mind this time?
Is it still necessary for Miss Mansouri to remain in town?
Why?
She needs a change.
This thing has affected her terribly.
She's on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
I want to take her to New York.
Why should it affect her more than anyone else in this town?
She's not the only one that was shocked by the murders.
She was the only one found unconscious near the scene of one of them.
Yeah, I was thinking of that.
All I meant was her shock was greater.
I've got to take her away.
I can't agree to that.
I'm not saying that Miss Mansouri is actually implicated in any way... but this is serious business.
And there's a doggone lot about it we don't know yet.
Just to make things a little more involved... a man was murdered in the Scripps Museum last night.
Not a doubt about it, Inspector.
Strangled, mold on the throat.
Everything identical with the killings in Mapleton.
Dr. Ayad, as an authority and an
Egyptian, what do you make of this?
I don't know what to make of it.
There's not a trace of Ananka's body.
Looks like you museum fellows had something put over on you.
Maybe there never was a body under those wrappings.
As curator of the Scripps Museum...
I examined this mummy when it was first brought in.
I assure you, the body of Ananka was there.
All right, Doctor. Then it's possible the mummy took it last night.
It would have been impossible for anyone to remove the body... without unwinding the bandages that bound it.
You can see for yourself not a single wrapping has been cut.
I don't know how to explain it.
What are those markings?
Hieroglyphics explaining the curse of Ananka.
Could you read them for me?
Certainly.
"Herein rests...
"and must forever rest the body of Ananka...
"third daughter of Amenophis.
"In the hills of Arkam shall Ananka lie...
"in the tomb appointed for her and in none other...
"because freed from its resting place...
"her soul may find reincarnation in another form... again to seek out its salvation on Earth."
Now let me get this straight.
Are you trying to tell me there's another Ananka running around loose?
I merely translated these hieroglyphics at your request, Inspector.
Maybe so, but it sounds like a lot of applesauce to me.
First it's a mummy, and now it's a reincarnated woman.
Did you find anything else?
Not a thing, Inspector.
I think I'll take a trip to Mapleton.
A little searching around there might turn up something.
How about it, Doctor?
Will you go with me?
I?
Yes, I may need your help.
I've had a lot of cases, but never anything like this.
If you really think you need me,
I'll be glad to go.
Good.
Where was that Egyptian girl found the night of the murder?
Right under that tree out there.
But we haven't found one thing that connects her with the case yet.
What's this?
Some sort of Egyptian ceremonial lamp.
Professor Norman was doing an experiment in it the night he was killed.
What kind of an experiment?
From what his wife could remember... he was something with those leaves.
Tana leaves.
Oh, the stuff that's supposed to keep the monster alive, I believe you said.
Yes, Inspector.
Will you translate that?
Gladly.
The inscription states that the mummy Kharis... would come for the tana leaves wherever they are.
But there are one or two symbols here which seem incomplete.
Norman had gone into this more deeply than I.
He was a great Egyptologist.
You've said enough to convince me of one thing.
Sheriff, in classic criminology... the criminal always returns to the scene of the crime.
But we're not dealing with an ordinary criminal... so maybe we can make him return.
How do you figure to do that?
The same way Professor Norman did.
Okay, Inspector.
Whatever you say.
Fine. If you'll step outside,
I'll explain the rest of my plan.
He went through these doors that night, didn't he?
Yes.
I want a deep pit dug right here... a deep one.
A pit?
Yes. You told me bullets wouldn't stop the mummy.
We ain't found any yet that would.
My idea is to trap the mummy when he comes.
If he comes.
All right, if he comes.
Once he's trapped, we'll have time to find something that will stop him.
Okay, Inspector.
Any way you want it.
Joe, take care of this.
All right, Sheriff.
Relax, honey, and try not to think about it.
I tried to relax, Tommy.
Honestly, I did.
But I have this awful, haunted feeling.
That settles it.
We're getting out of here.
What do you mean?
We're going to New York, to my people.
Can you be ready to leave early in the morning?
Oh, Tom, of course, but...
But what?
But you've forgotten.
Sheriff Elwood said I must stay in town.
Can you imagine me forgetting that?
We'll send him a telegram and apologize for leaving without saying good-bye.
But your people, Tommy, maybe they won't want me.
Honey, I've been doing a lot of telephoning today.
My family is busy getting out the heirloom jewels for the bride.
"The bride"?
Oh, no, Tom.
So you don't want to marry me?
Trying to brush me off.
It's just that you mustn't do this, Tommy.
You'll be graduated soon and...
I love you, Amina.
I hate to interrupt your love scene, but it's getting late.
You're right.
This girl has to get plenty of rest.
We're leaving first thing early in the morning.
"Leaving"?
Yes, for New York.
I'm taking her away from here.
I'm glad, Tom.
It's the best thing you can do.
Take good care of her until morning. Won't you?
You may be sure of that.
We're going in and lock all the doors.
Not one will be opened before morning.
Good enough. There's one other thing.
Peanuts and I had a man-to-man talk.
We both agreed she needs a bodyguard who will never leave her side.
He's convinced me he's the man for the job.
He's yours from now on, with all his accomplishments... including his yelp, appetite and fleas... to watch over you and keep you from harm.
Thank you.
Good night, ladies.
Good-bye, Tom.
Come, darling.
Hear me, almighty gods of Egypt.
Somewhere in the land there is flesh and bone... that hides the spirit of Ananka.
Show me her dwelling place,
O Almighty Amon-Ra.
Give me a sign out of your omniscience and mercy.
Give me a sign that I may send Kharis forth... to reclaim her for whom the tombs of Arkam wait.
If now the hour has come to seek and find... give me a sign.
Shed your light upon the darkness of my groping.
Hear my prayer...
The light.
The sign.
Go, Kharis.
This must be the hour.
Now you will find her.
By the light and by the sign... you will know her.
Go.
I guess we're on our way.
I'm very sorry to subject you to this, Mrs. Norman.
That's all right.
I want to help.
Perhaps this time, these horrors will be ended.
Thank you. Now, where was your husband the last time you saw him?
He was seated there.
Is that about right?
Yes.
I came down to ask him to come to bed... to let his experiment wait until morning.
Doctor, will you please take the professor's place?
Certainly.
Now, just what was he doing?
He was simply boiling some leaves and taking notes.
That was all.
What about the lights?
This lamp was on.
And the only other light was the one there on the desk.
Will you turn out the other lights, please?
Now, Mrs. Norman,
Can you remember anything else... any remark of his that might be important?
No, I don't think so.
Wait. He was excited about something.
It seems he had just discovered... what some writing meant on there.
Try to remember.
I think it was something about nine.
He said nine as if it was very important.
Important? It's the clue
I needed to complete this.
Nine... Nine tana leaves.
That's what he meant.
That's fine. Thank you, Mrs. Norman.
You've been a great help.
Now please go to your room. We have men on guard, so you'll be perfectly safe.
Thank you.
Sheriff.
I guess we're all ready.
Go ahead, Doctor.
Yes?
What about Amina?
Wait a minute, I...
Get help! Hurry!
How deep did you dig it?
Ten feet. All right?
Yeah, it should be.
You're going to camouflage that better?
Oh, sure.
You men know what we're out for tonight.
I think we're playing a long shot, but it may work.
I want you men to spread out and watch for the mummy.
If he shows himself at all, keep him heading this way.
You men, take the north end of the turnpike road...
Beg your pardon, Sheriff.
If the mummy starts this way at all, he'll come all the way... to get what he's after.
If he gets here, we'll need every man we've got to handle him.
I suggest that you concentrate your forces right around the house here.
Okay, Inspector, it's your show.
If the monster gets here, don't any of you try to tackle him alone.
Simply let him come through.
We want to trap him in that pit if it's humanly possible.
Is that clear?
Yes, Inspector.
Okay, boys, stick to the grounds, and good luck.
SheriFF Elwood, help!
Hurry, it's the mummy!
Look out!
There's a pit!
Oh, please,
I've got to see the sheriff.
Here I am, Mrs. Blake.
What happened?
Amina, the mummy took her!
The fields!
Come on, men!
All right, take her home.
Come here.
Come here.
Where is she, boy?
Where is she? Show me.
The light and the sign...
Ananka.
She's beautiful, Kharis.
As she was centuries ago.
She has returned.
The will of Amon-Ra has been done.
Kharis, we turn our eyes toward home.
Who are you?
Why am I here?
I am a Priest of Arkam... and you are here because the gods have willed it so.
Let me go.
Do you not know who you are?
I am Amina Mansouri.
You are the Princess Ananka, third daughter of Amenophis... onetime pharaoh of all Egypt.
You're mad.
Centuries ago, you died a cursed death.
No...
The birthmark of Ananka, symbol of the Priests of Arkam.
You cannot escape your destiny.
It's not true.
It is true.
For those who dery the will of the ancient gods... a cruel and violent death shall be their fate.
Never shall they fiNd rest unto eternity.
You have done
Your work well, Yousef Bey.
The gods will look with favor upon you.
Why do you not reJoice?
Perhaps because it grieves you... to consign this lovely girl to death again.
Why should she not live,
Yousef Bey?
Why should you not live?
I live to fulfill my destiny as a Priest of Arkam.
But what of your destiny as a man?
You are thousands of miles from the tombs of Arkam.
She is thousands of years from her sin.
Look at her.
She is beautiful.
Kharis dared to love her.
Are you less brave than he?
Almighty Isis, protect me in my hour of temptation.
Give me the strength to fulfill my vows as a Priest of Arkam.
The tana leaves,
Yousef Bey.
The tana leaves will keep her
Young and beautiful forever.
Take them, Yousef Bey.
You and Ananka together forever.
Forever!
You have nothing more to fear.
Not death nor decay.
Here in this cup is my gift of life to you.
I am going to make you immortal.
And I, too, shall drink and be immortal.
We will not return to Egypt.
Our world shall be wide.
Our time shall be without end.
Has any man before oFFered the gift... of eternal life to his bride?
Kharis! Stop!
I'll take her back, Kharis!
Together, we'll go to Arkam.
The three of us! I swear it!
Good dog.
We're onto something.
Come on, boys.
It's young Hervey, Sheriff.
How is he?
The monster...
Up there. Amina.
Come on, men!
Stay with him, Doc.
Looks like somebody else has been messing around with tana leaves.
And not so long ago.
Now, wait.
You'd better take it easy.
Yeah, just...
There's nobody up in that shack.
Listen.
Amina! Amina!
You can't go in that swamp.
It's certain death.
Let go of me.
Hervey. Hervey!
Come back here!
Amina! Amina!
Hang on, boy.
The fate of those who deFY the will of the ancient gods... shall be a cruel and violent death.
Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.
For thy kingdom come, thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever.
Amen.
I'd like you to have my notes and records.
Of all the newspapers, yours was the only one which was fair to me.
Thanks, Doctor.
Friday the 13th.
This morning my old friend,
George Kingsley,
was conducting his class
at the University of Newcastle...
And in 1547
Sir Joshua Peachtree wrote:
"Thou who breakest glass will find
"Fate can be, oh, most unkind
"Under ladder walkest thee, most unlucky thou wilt be
"Each dread Friday do take care
Else thou fallest down the stair. "
And with that little epic,
Sir Joshua proved that he was a poet of the first rank.
In fact, I should say, he possibly was the rankest poet that England ever turned out.
Just a moment, please.
Just a moment.
This being the end of the semester,
I have an announcement to make that I'm sure will give you a great deal of pleasure, although I myself am sorry to tell you that I may not be with you next term.
Today I must leave to appear before the inquisitional board of regents of a very large university in the east.
Very large university indeed.
How many the dunces that has been sent to Rome, excels the dunce that must stay at home.
I sincerely hope the board does not like me.
I'll try and be back next term.
Oh, my umbrella.
Dr. Kingsley.
Yes, dear.
I wish you the best of luck, but...
Thank you.
We hope to see you next semester, Doctor.
Hurry, Professor. Dad will be waiting to take us to the station.
Have a good trip, Professor.
Hurry back.
Thank you very much.
Professor.
Yes, John.
English won't seem the same without you.
Well, that's very nice of you.
Come on, Professor.
You know, Jean,
I'm going to miss all this.
But most of all,
I'm going to miss your father.
A brilliant man, Jean.
It distresses me to think that such a great brain surgeon should be so utterly wasted in Newcastle.
Newcastle is a very welcome port in a very bad storm.
Why, if it hadn't been for you, Professor,
I don't know what we'd have done.
Well, Margaret, you don't know how sorry I am to see you and George leave.
You've befriended Jean and me in so many ways since we came to live here.
We're going to miss you too, Ern.
Thank you.
Here they are.
Hello, darling.
Hello, Margaret.
If I could only drive, I'd never impose on you like this.
It's a pleasure, George.
Rather a mixed one, you know.
We hate to see you go.
Hello, Dad.
Oh, I knew
I'd forgotten something.
As usual. What now?
Ernest, would you mind stopping at the student's cleaning shop?
My one and only hat is there.
And a professor must have dignity when he goes to the city.
Here we are, George.
Dr. George, we're here.
George, hurry or we'll miss the train.
Professor, don't let them sell you one of those fancy feathers.
I won't, Jean, I won't.
And George.
George. George?
Yes, dear.
Now watch the traffic.
Be careful.
Yes, darling. Don't worry.
Careful now, please.
Mr. Red Cannon now belongs to the history of crime.
Past tense.
What about our dough?
We ain't got it yet.
Yeah. How about it?
Mr. Devore, it would have been poor business to kill Red, unless I knew how to locate the money.
Turn back to the city.
Ernest.
He's going to be all right, my dear.
Now, you go home with Jean and I'll call you later.
We'll be waiting, Dad.
Come, Margaret.
Ambulance, huh?
Uh-huh.
Some men were shooting at you. Who were they?
Just a few of my pals.
How bad am I hurt?
Few minor cuts on the scalp.
That's all.
Any pain?
No, not much.
Who's the other customer?
The man you ran down.
He's dying.
Softy, huh?
Did those guys get away?
Yes.
Then pull the bell cord of this bus. This is where I get off.
I'm goin' rat-killin'.
Hey, I'm tied down.
What is this? A pinch?
Turn that thing off.
I can't stand it.
It's driving me crazy!
It's no use, Sovac.
Kingsley has compound frontal and parietal fracture and severe concussion of the cerebrum.
Just a matter of hours, or minutes.
Pulse 65. He's in a coma.
All right, Nurse.
You can go. I'll stay.
What's the matter with me,
Doc?
Thanks.
What's the matter with me,
Doc?
I can't feel anything.
My legs are there, but I can't feel 'em.
Your spine is broken.
You're paralyzed.
Well, pull me through,
Doc, will you?
Pull me through and I'll pay you anything.
The only possible way
to save George Kingsley's life
is by a brain transplantation,
an operation I performed successfully on animals.
This is a dangerous and illegal operation,
but a chance to make a great scientific discovery,
and perhaps save my friend's life.
Ern, how long will his head be bandaged?
Oh, not long now.
Dr. Sovac.
Yes?
Two gentlemen want to see you.
Who are they?
They are detectives,
I believe.
I'll see them.
Excuse me, please.
I'll be right back, George.
A miraculous recovery,
Mrs. Kingsley.
Amazing.
It's Cannon, all right.
Well, Doctor, the head injuries cause death?
And many complications.
His spine was broken.
We did all we could for him.
Don't feel badly about it,
Doctor. He wasn't worth it.
He had nothing but the electric chair to live for.
Did he say anything before he died?
About money, for instance?
Not that I know of.
Thanks, Doctor.
$500,000.
With that money I could build my own laboratory
and continue with my experiments.
Kingsley is convalescing
and seems to show some of Red Cannon's traits.
Does the Cannon brain in Kingsley's head
retain the knowledge of the hidden money?
I've been waiting to see you, Ernest.
I'm worried about George.
He just doesn't seem himself.
Why, he's getting stronger every day, isn't he?
Physically, yes.
But his mental condition doesn't seem right.
He's irritable.
Flies into a rage for no reason at all.
That isn't like George.
No, it isn't.
He has been acting strangely, lately.
I don't think I'd be too alarmed about it though, if I were you.
Well, I hope you're right.
I think so.
You're late today, Ernest.
Come and sit down and talk to me.
I'm feeling very low.
Will you have some tea?
No, thanks.
The trouble with you is, you're feeling too well.
Too well?
I used to think that a long period of convalescence would be like an ocean voyage.
That I'd have a chance to read all the books I want to, that I haven't time to, ordinarily.
But nothing seems to interest me.
A boring period, convalescence.
Yes, indeed it is.
I'm afraid I've got to go to
New York for a few days, George.
You've got to...
Yes, a little business for the hospital.
Well, that's nice, I must say.
What am I going to do for companionship?
Well, why not come with me?
Come with you?
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
New York's too big, too noisy.
I never have wanted to go there. And yet...
The very thing you need, George.
You've had your fill of peace and quiet.
You'll find New York exciting, stimulating.
Just the thing to lift you out of the doldrums.
As my doctor, do you prescribe it?
As your doctor,
I insist on it.
Very well.
I'll tell Margaret to pack.
Oh, no, George.
Let's go alone.
Alone?
In New York, without Margaret?
What you need is a radical change.
Well, perhaps you're right,
Ernest.
I've been like a bear, lately.
I'm quite sure she'd be glad to be rid of me for a time.
New York.
New York. I wonder...
I am taking Kingsley to Red's old environment.
In fact, to the Midtown Hotel
which Cannon used as his hideout.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Uh, we'd like adjoining rooms.
Uh, yes, yes.
Uh, 505 and 506, if they're available. Are they?
Well, yes, they're available.
Thank you.
Uh, you've been with us before, sir?
Why?
No, of course not.
But I... I like a corner room with three windows and a fire escapes.
This way, gentlemen.
Well? Well?
Uh, I'm... I'm in the next room, Ernest.
Uh, will you bring the black bag in here, please?
You sure picked a room with a history, Mr. Kingsley.
Oh, really?
But you see, history is not my subject.
I don't mean that.
I'm talkin' about Red Cannon.
He hid out in these rooms for nearly six months, from cops, G-men and his own gang.
Nobody in the hotel suspected him.
But his gang got wise and Red tried to run out.
They caught up to him in some small town in the sticks.
Imagine when we found out who he was.
And him with nearly a million bucks hidden away.
Say, the manager locked himself in here and took these rooms apart.
Yes, yes.
But he's still the manager, so I guess he didn't find it.
Anyway, I made plenty out of Cannon.
I was the only one he allowed up here.
I had a special way of knockin'.
Yes, sir. That's it.
Thanks.
A talkative youngster.
Babbles on like Tennyson's brook.
Ernest, I'm going to freshen up a bit.
And then let's go out.
Let's, uh, do the town.
You know what I mean.
A good dinner, and perhaps a bottle of wine.
Splendid, George.
I'll get changed and then we'll go.
"I chatter, chatter as I flow
"To join the brimming river
"For men may come and men may go
But I go on forever. "
The Cannon brain remembers this hotel.
Will it also remember
Red's friends?
Miller, Kane,
Devore and Marnay.
I'm taking Kingsley to the Club Royale
where he'll see Sunny Rogers,
Cannon's former sweetheart.
An old fashioned.
George?
I'm ready for anything.
Two.
Yes, sir.
I find the singer rather interesting, don't you, George?
Yeah. Who is she, Ernest?
I seem to know her.
Could she be one of my former students?
I really am surprised,
George, at your pretending to know the singer.
Well, come, come, come now, Ernest.
I'm a college professor, not a college boy.
All these people here on pleasure bent.
"And pleasure brings as surely in her train
Remorse and sorrow and vindictive pain" as William Kelper says.
Oh, pardon me.
Sure.
Why, what's wrong, George?
My head hurts.
That pain again.
I can't stand it.
We'll leave instantly.
Yes. Yes, the next train leaves at noon.
You wish me to make a reservation?
Yes, please.
And send up a boy to help me pack, will you?
Well, good morning, George.
You slept late.
But my sleep doesn't seem to refresh me.
Ernst, we're old enough friends that we don't have to deceive each other.
Why do you say that?
Then tell me, what is the matter with me?
My sleep only seems to tire me.
And I am haunted by the most horrible dreams.
A perfectly normal reaction to the shock of your accident, George.
Come in.
What do you mean by that ridiculous tap, tap, tap-tap-tapping?
Why don't you knock the door like anybody else?
Anything you say, sir.
You wanted me to pack?
Yes.
I don't know what I'm doing here, anyway.
Ernest, I'm going home.
I need Margaret.
I don't think I'd try to leave today, George.
Now, you can stop the packing.
Yes, sir.
I don't think you're well enough to travel.
Now, let's wait and see how you feel tomorrow.
Red. Red Cannon.
You were the leader of a gang.
They tried to kill you.
You came back to get revenge.
Red.
Do you remember the name,
Marnay?
Marnay.
He's the one who took your place.
Marnay, Miller, Kane, Devore.
Why did they try to kill you, Red?
Uh, to get your money?
But they didn't find it, did they?
It's safe just where you hid it.
Where is it, Red?
Marnay.
Miller.
Kane.
Devore.
You've been ill, Red.
I remember that... that hick town.
You're the doc, ain't you?
Yes.
Say, my back's better.
You cured me?
Yes.
You're perfectly well now.
Thanks, Doc.
I won't forget it either.
Midtown Hotel, huh?
How did I get here?
You asked me to bring you.
I must have been out of my head.
Every copper in town will be lookin' for me.
I've got something to tell you, Red.
Oh, yeah? What?
You were smashed up in an accident, you remember?
I had to operate to give you another body.
You had to do what?
What are you talking about?
Why did you do this to me?
It was the only way to keep you alive.
Oh.
Why, Doc, you're a genius, but you could have given me a better chassis.
I never saw plastic surgery like that before.
I used the body of the other man, who was dead.
It was the only way to save you.
Hey, wait a minute.
Nobody will know me like this.
Why, I can do anything.
Who was the other guy?
He was a professor of English Literature.
English Literature?
Well, how are you, Prof?
You're now
Prof. George Kingsley, and you teach in the university at Newcastle.
What a disguise.
What a break for Red Cannon.
Come in.
Telegram, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, what is...
Next time, you do as you're told.
When you come to my room, knock like this.
Now scram.
Yes, sir.
Next time.
Red, I think...
Good morning, sir.
I'll take them.
And, uh, here's the morning paper, sir.
Compliments of the house.
Thank you.
You sure get around, mister.
From the looks of those clothes, seems like you fell into a cement mixer.
That will be all.
Yes, sir.
Morning?
Yes.
How do you feel?
Not very well.
I'm afraid coming to New York was too exciting. I...
I feel as if... as if the life were drained out of me.
You will be all right as soon as you've had a little rest.
Well, perhaps so.
Here's a curious thing,
George.
It seems that Louis Devore, one of the Red Cannon gang, was found early this morning in a deserted building dying from the effects of a brutal beating.
His back had been broken.
Good heavens, Ernest.
Why on earth bother me with that gruesome stuff?
Sorry, George.
Things have taken a dangerous turn.
Kingsley has killed Devore.
While in this environment
I never know
when the murderous brain of Red Cannon
may take possession of Kingsley.
But I will not stop my experiments.
I must find out where the
Cannon money is hidden.
All ready, George?
Oh, miss.
Yes, sir?
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to open my friend's door for me.
I'm a little worried about him.
He hasn't been very well.
Yes, sir.
I ain't been feeling so well myself, lately.
Evidently, my friend has gone out.
Well, you can wait for me.
Your hat, sir?
No, thank you.
I was here the other night with a friend.
The rather middle-aged gentleman?
That's right.
Has he been here tonight?
I don't think so.
Well, wait a minute, there was a gentleman that looked like him at the bar.
At the bar?
Oh, no, no.
Uh, on second thought, it couldn't have been your friend.
And besides, that man left a little while ago, sir.
I don't think Sunny was pleased to see us.
Why are we wastin' time foolin' around here?
Didn't you see that newspaper picture of Devore's battered body?
So maybe that killer's after us too.
A good deduction.
But who would want us dead except some friend of Red's?
And who would know about Red Cannon's friends better than Sunny?
That's right.
Tell your nerves to stop doin' nip-ups.
Marnay will handle this.
You will handle this, Kane.
I've seen you trying to take Red's place here.
Go on.
I didn't have any part in Devore's killing.
Nobody said you did.
Then everything is just lovely.
I'd like to see you at your apartment after you're through.
Maybe if we put together what you know about Red and what I know, it will add up to some money.
Say, if I knew anything about a half a million bucks, do you think
I'd be working in this joint?
We'll go over all that later.
Like it?
Sure.
It's yours tonight.
Hey, what is this?
Get out of my car.
What do you want?
You ought not to have to think very hard after what happened to Devore.
Who are you?
Hello, Bill.
Who is it?
"Who is it" sent you that money
to get out of that trouble in Chicago.
Red?
You're alive?
Well... Yes.
I'll be right up.
Red.
Well, of all the...
Don't speak.
Don't even move.
Just let me look at you.
It's great to be back, Sunny.
Why did you move the piano?
You know I always liked it in that corner.
How do you know about that?
Surely you didn't think I'd forget in two short months?
Are there any cigarettes in the drawer?
Yes.
You look good, darling.
Come on, let's have a drink.
Nothing touched, eh?
Good girl.
Well, here we are.
How do you like the trimmings?
Let me put it on.
How did you get it?
Just picked it up.
Well, you don't seem very glad to see me.
You're afraid.
What are you afraid of?
Well, I'm not afraid.
Red Cannon must be jumping with joy in his grave the way his boys are getting knocked off.
All right, boys.
Now about the Devore and Kane murders, you know, they were both Cannon's men.
We've always believed his own gang was responsible for Red's death.
Can some friend of his be systematically killing off his murderers?
A dead gangster has no friends.
I want you to go out and find Marnay and Miller.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Take a couple of men with you and check the Ritz Manor apartments.
You're sure this is
Marnay's apartment?
Well, good afternoon.
I'm sorry, but Mr. Marnay is not at home.
Do you mind if we wait for him?
Not at all.
Are you a friend of Mr. Marnay?
In a way. I'm just waiting till he comes back.
Who are you?
What?
We're from police headquarters.
Oh, I see.
My name is Kingsley.
I'm a professor of English at the University of Newcastle.
From Newcastle?
Yes.
You're the professor who was hit the time Red Cannon was killed?
That's right.
What business could you have with Marnay?
You better come along with us and explain that to the DA.
Good morning, Sunny.
Marnay.
What's the matter?
Aren't we welcome?
So Kane was here last night.
Well, I, uh, had a date with him, but he didn't show up.
The police found his body this morning, strangled.
Yeah, and his back was broken, just like Devore's.
I don't know anything about it.
No? If Kane wasn't here where did you get that watch?
Well, I expected him, but somebody else came and gave me the watch.
Who?
He said he was Red Cannon.
What did he drive up in, a hearse?
Try again, and be a little more believable.
Red was here. Look.
Red always killed his cigarettes this way.
Now you've got to be alive to do that.
Red's been dead since two months.
That's what I thought.
But last night this man came here.
He didn't look like Red, but...
This is the first thing he did when he came in.
He knew everything that only Red knew.
He even acted and talked like Red.
Probably somebody
Red coached carefully.
Somebody from that hick town who got close to him before he died.
If he knows so much, he may know where Red hid the money.
That would be his payoff.
He gets Red's money for killing all of us.
Where does he live?
I suppose you are going to say
"Room 505 at the Midtown"...
Who left these matches here?
Ask Devore and Kane.
Thank you.
Um, any word of Prof. Kingsley?
Nothing, Doctor.
Hmm.
Dad.
Margaret was so worried, we talked it over and decided to come on to New York.
Ernest, I just have to see George. Where is he?
Well, he's out.
I... I don't quite know where.
But I... I thought you were always with him.
I'm afraid, you're not going to like this, Margaret, but I'm going to be quite blunt with you.
When George was convalescing at home, you were a marvellous nurse.
I did what I could.
Exactly.
When he turned his head, you adjusted the pillow.
If he reached for a glass of water, you were pouring it for him.
I'm sorry
I couldn't do more.
But that's just the trouble.
If you had kept it up, he would have been a permanent invalid.
Well, why didn't you tell me?
Naturally, I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
And fortunately, George himself rebelled in time.
That's why you brought him to New York alone with you.
Of course, my dear.
He had to have a change.
Has it helped? Is he better?
Yes, he is but we must still be careful.
Now, I suggest that you allow him to remain here till he's perfectly ready to go home of his own accord.
And don't try to see him.
Oh, but I...
You and Jean go up to your rooms and get some rest, and take the first train out to
Newcastle in the morning, huh?
Well, if it's best for him, all right.
Believe me, it is.
Well, there's George.
Margaret, you said you wouldn't try to see him.
Will you take her to her room, Jean?
But, Dad...
Jean, I assure you what I'm doing is for his own good.
Now please believe me.
Who were the women?
Never mind that.
What's happened to your shoulder?
I got nicked.
Who were those women?
My daughter and your wife.
My... My what?
Oh, Kingsley's, huh?
Well, get them out of here.
I don't want any dames around here.
Let me see.
You've been shot.
Yeah. Fix it up, will you.
How'd you get it?
The coppers shot me.
It's a scratch.
How'd you get it?
Don't ride me.
It's your fault, anyway.
Mine?
Yeah. You told me to use this
Kingsley gag. I did, and didn't work.
Where were you?
In Marnay's apartment.
They tried to question Prof.
Kingsley and I wouldn't stand for it.
You killed them?
What do you think?
Get to work.
You fool.
They'll catch you before we get the money and...
What money?
What do you know about the money?
You know too much, Doc.
Just a minute, Red.
If you kill me, what becomes of you?
You think you're
Red Cannon, don't you?
But whose body are you wearing?
Well, you told me...
Exactly. George Kingsley's.
Professor of English literature at Newcastle.
How'd you like to be Kingsley for good?
What do you mean?
You're walking around in Kingsley's body, all right.
But part of your brain is his and you can't control it.
That's not true.
You killed Devore.
Last night you murdered Kane in his car outside the club.
I saw it, remember?
But do you remember how you woke up?
In this very room, you woke as Kingsley.
Complaining of nightmares, not knowing why you were here.
I can't think.
What's happened to my brain?
I can't remember.
Of course you can't.
If I hadn't forced you back into Red Cannon, you'd have gone to Newcastle as Kingsley for life.
Stop it.
I can make you forget you ever were Red Cannon.
Stop it, I tell you!
I'll cut you in on the dough.
You'll get your share.
From now on, you do exactly as I say.
Okay, Doc.
Now, I'll fix that shoulder.
It's no use, Jean. I'm not going home in the morning, not unless
George goes with me.
But you told Dad...
I don't care what I said.
When George came in, your father practically ran me out.
He's trying to conceal something.
No, Margaret.
I'm going to see George now, and if Ernest tries to stop me, I'll call a New York doctor.
Margaret, I'm sure you're worrying over nothing.
But I'll go talk to Dad.
There you are.
Okay, nice job, Doc.
It's not safe to stay here too long.
You get that money tonight.
Maybe you're right.
I'll get going right away.
You...
Prof. King.
Dad.
Jean.
Dad, he didn't even know who I was.
Oh, nonsense, Jean.
And the way he looked.
He was like Prof. Kingsley and yet...
Dad, what is back of all this?
Haven't you guessed?
The operation I performed was a brain transplantation.
Then his brain...
Is partly the brain of Red Cannon.
Dad.
Your best friend.
Oh, you couldn't.
I saved his life, didn't I?
Well, what's the good if you've turned him into a criminal?
My only thought was to keep him alive, I swear it.
But when I saw signs of the gradual awakening of the Cannon brain,
I knew I'd made a great discovery for science.
Cannon's a gangster, a murderer.
All right.
But in the meantime,
I've proved what I always knew to be true.
Transplanted human brain cells will live and function.
What a triumph! Think of it.
I'm not a scientist, Father.
I can only see you destroying your best friend.
It's too late to think of that.
But you must.
Think what you're doing to him and Margaret.
Oh, he'll be all right.
As soon as I get him back to
Newcastle, he'll forget all about this.
But I can't do that until...
Until what?
Until the experiment is completed.
You've got to take him home tomorrow.
Why?
Because it's the only human thing to do.
Margaret is suspicious.
She threatens to call in a New York doctor.
Then the truth is bound to come out.
Don't forget, Dad, you had no legal right to operate.
It means prison, and every chance you might have had for a career in this country is lost.
Very well.
Tell Margaret we'll go back to Newcastle in the morning.
I'll tell her.
"Gang killer slays two detectives. "
You'd think the police would catch the killer by now.
A guy like that must be a lunatic.
If I got one look at him,
I could tell his type.
The same, sir?
Oh, hello, darling.
I sent you a message I was coming back to your dressing room.
Run home and pack.
Pack? Where are we goin'?
South America, for a starter.
Have we, um, money enough?
All the money in the world.
Understand?
All the money in the world.
Let me have the keys to your car.
I don't want taxi drivers hangin' around.
Yeah, sure.
You'll hear from me in an hour, and I'll have everything we need.
You ready?
What do you think?
He wants me to run away with him.
He's going to pick up the money now.
Good.
I knew he would, sooner or later.
We'll get it and split it three ways.
Well, that's all right with me. I'll point him out.
There he is, at the bar.
Just getting up.
He's taking my car.
It should be easy to follow.
How do you figure this guy?
When Red got hit, he couldn't have told everything he knew before he died.
I only know that Red is planted in a graveyard, and I'm not afraid of anyone else.
And me neither.
But knowing this guy knows everything Red knew kind of gives me the creeps.
He's leading us to half a million dollars.
We'll take that box.
Go ahead and shoot, if you want to dive 200 feet for it.
The money is what we want.
Hand it over and we'll give you a break.
Okay.
Come and get it.
Keep him covered.
You never saw the day I couldn't break you apart, Miller.
What's happened?
Where's Miller?
Get me something to open this.
Hurry.
Go get me a drink.
Then we're on our way.
Sunny, the split on this now is two ways.
Sunny.
Get in there.
You're late.
Where's Marnay?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.
Why is the bar open?
I was getting a drink.
I'm almost packed, and just waiting for you.
W- Why are you staring at me?
What's happened to you?
Marnay and Miller followed me from the nightclub.
Now I know why you didn't want me to come back to your dressing room.
They were there.
Red, what are you looking for?
Don't you believe me?
I haven't seen Marnay for six months.
Red, look at me.
There's never been anybody but you.
Believe me.
What were you saying?
Let me out!
I'll tell you where the money is. I hid it.
I hid it.
It's in the oven, Red.
It's in the oven.
Let me out. I'll tell you where the money is.
It's in the oven!
Let me out.
Let me out!
I swear.
No.
Let me out.
Out.
Please, don't hurt me.
Taxi.
Yes, sir.
Where to?
Westley Airport.
Yes, sir.
Pardon the yawn.
A hack driver that works all night shouldn't have kids.
All night you work your heart out for the woman and the little darlings.
All day long, while you're trying to snatch 40 winks, the old lady slams the doors.
The kids chase each other in and out of the room.
One kid jumps up on the bed, hops on your stomach,
"Daddy, tell me a story.
Tell me a funny story. "
I knock him out of the bed.
He screams.
The old lady calls me a tramp.
Home, sweet home.
I'll kill them.
Shut up. I don't like gabby taxi drivers.
Westley Airport.
Westley Airport.
What?
Westley Airport.
Drive me to the Midtown Hotel.
Midtown Hotel.
It's a crazy business, but it's a livin'.
Midtown Hotel.
Thank you. Keep the change.
Hey, you forgot your box.
George.
Ernest, something's happened to my mind.
I found myself in a taxi.
And I don't know how I got there.
Ernest.
Just a minute, George.
You know Margaret and Jean are here?
Margaret? Here?
Yes.
Now drink this.
I want you to get some rest before you see them.
Now, don't worry about a thing.
Tomorrow everything will be all right.
I hope you enjoyed your visit, Mr. Kingsley.
Very much, indeed.
Thank you.
May I have the bill?
Oh, no, George, allow me.
It was understood you were to be my guest, you know.
Mr. Kingsley?
Yes. That's my name.
The Chief of Police would like to see you.
Oh, really?
I don't even know him.
We'll introduce you.
What can the Chief of
Police possibly want?
Well, there can't be any charge against Prof. Kingsley, surely.
The Chief will explain all that.
Who are you?
I'm his doctor.
He's just recovering from an extremely serious illness.
Come along.
I'd like to go, too, if you don't mind.
All right. Come on.
Well, uh, you go ahead to the station, dear.
Yes, but George...
No, no, no.
It's all right.
We'll meet you there.
Goodbye.
This is Mr. Kingsley,
Chief.
And his doctor.
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
A cab driver tried to change this at the bank.
Circumstances were so unusual, we are holding him for investigation.
A thousand dol...
Look, Ernest, a $1,000 bill.
They really exist.
The cab driver said you gave him that for a tip.
The cab driver...
That's a kingly gesture.
I'm sure you honour me, but $1,000, why, that's almost six months' salary.
Bring the driver in.
What's your occupation,
Mr. Kingsley?
I'm... I'm a professor of English literature.
And I might add, a very underpaid professor.
Go on.
I tell you,
I've gotta get out of here.
My wife, she won't like havin' me stayin' in jail.
Is this the man that gave you that $1,000 bill?
How do you do?
Him?
Does he look like a $1,000 note to you?
The guy I was talkin' about was a gangster, who pushed me in the face.
Can you imagine him pushin' me in the face?
Oh, no.
That's all, Mr. Kingsley.
Sorry to have inconvenienced you.
Thanks for coming in.
Thank you.
We barely have time to catch the train, George.
Yes.
Back in Newcastle,
the Red Cannon brain has become completely dormant.
Kingsley has returned to his classroom,
and now I can actually bring to a realization
my plans for a great laboratory,
and give the world the benefit of my scientific knowledge.
Thus, you see, the Elizabethan novel was a minor passing form.
And fed the drama of the period which,
I might add, devoured it avidly.
I'm going to let you go a little early this afternoon.
Early, but not immediately.
And I'm quite sure you all will be glad to hear that tomorrow we're going to have a quiz on the past two weeks' work.
I must apologize for not giving you your full hour this afternoon, but my closest friend, Dr.
Sovac, is leaving Newcastle.
What was that?
What is it?
What's that noise?
What is it?
Why don't you answer me?
It's a siren.
Probably an ambulance or a police car.
Get a doctor.
Professor, maybe we can help you. What can we do?
Here you are.
Thank you, dear.
Gosh, Dad,
I hate to leave this place.
Seems so much like home to me.
I know, Jean, but at least
I'm going to a better position.
Of course, Dad.
Now I'll pack the rest of the books.
Oh, Dad, I've packed all your instruments.
Good girl, Jean.
Why, Pro...
Where is he?
Where is the doc?
I want my dough. Where is it?
You know where it is. You were sneakin' away with it.
What do you mean?
Tell me where it is!
Dad!
Stop it.
Red!
Ernst.
Why?
Why did you do it?
Why, Ernest?
I think you know the answer now, George.
I pronounce this man dead.
DVD Rip
Most of these incidents are so incredible that one would almost have to be there in order to believe them.
You know, many people believe that we archeologists are just a collection of old fogies digging around in ruins after old dried-up skulls and bones.
Particularly medical men like yourself.
Isn't that so, John?
I wouldn't say that, Dad.
Not everybody thinks that way.
Oh, I could go on telling you stories like this all day long.
Personally, I think you're boring Isobel and her mother.
Who cares what happened 3,000 years ago?
Being my sister doesn't give you the right to be disrespectful.
- I'll have you...
- Now, now.
Are you two children going to start that feud all over again?
Oh, I just get annoyed.
So does everybody else.
Am I boring you, Mrs. Evans?
Oh, not at all. I find it most interesting.
And you, Isobel?
Oh, I should say not.
Please tell us the rest.
Hmm.
All right.
Well, we started out from Cairo to search for Ananka's tomb.
We weren't a particularly adventuresome-looking group.
There was Babe Hanson, an old friend of mine, a Brooklyn magician named Solvani and his daughter, Marta.
And, oh, yes, Dr. Petrie of the Cairo Museum.
We traveled for a long, long time through the desert,
then up into the mountains.
Babe! Babe, where are you?
- Wow!
- What happened? You all right?
I don't know. I started to hook the wire to the detonator to set off the dynamite and here I am.
Effendi! Effendi!
This is an unholy tomb.
It's the seal of the Seven Jackals.
What we've been searching for.
They mustn't touch it, effendi.
There's a curse upon it.
Oh, bosh.
It means death to whoever breaks that seal.
We can't stop now for a lot of silly native superstitions.
I have waited a long time for this moment.
The native workers fled, screaming something about there being a curse on the place.
However, it didn't turn out to be Ananka's tomb at all.
Easy. It's heavy. Watch out.
That's good. Look.
Whoa!
Why, it isn't sealed.
Let's take it off.
Careful, now. Careful.
That isn't Princess Ananka. It's a man.
And in the finest state of preservation of any mummy I've ever seen.
Later on, we found the most amazing thing about this mummy.
Doctor.
What do these lines in his face mean?
There's only one answer. He was buried alive.
He must have struggled desperately against those bandages.
What a terrible way to die.
Probably for some sacrilege.
Possibly. Have you touched his face?
- What?
- Go ahead. Touch it.
Feels like living tissue.
Exactly.
How true that proved to be.
Because, astounding as it may seem,
Kharis had never really died.
We learned afterward that Kharis was being kept alive by a strange race of high priests.
Only one of these high priests remained, a man by the name of Andoheb.
He and a servant kept constant watch
on our movements from up above in the mountains.
Very interesting, aren't they, Dr. Petrie?
Professor Andoheb.
Where did you come from?
The important thing,
Doctor, is that I'm here.
Then you knew about this tomb, and yet you insisted the vase was an imitation.
There are some things in science which should be brought to light.
And there are others, Doctor, which should be left alone.
You mean, we never should have come into this cave?
Since you are here, I think it's fitting that you should learn exactly what you've stumbled upon.
Come.
For a scientist, you are very unobserving, Dr. Petrie.
Why, there's a pulse beat.
Why, this is absurd. It's... It's fantastic.
In this vial, I have the fluid from nine tana leaves.
Nine tana leaves, Dr. Petrie.
That wouldn't mean anything to you, but watch.
Now, Dr. Petrie.
Why, it's... It's beating faster.
He's alive.
Let me go!
Get off! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
The mummy. Somebody swiped it.
Who could've done that?
- I can't understand it.
- Steve, Petrie!
What could've happened?
I don't know, Babe.
He's dead.
Go on and get some sleep, Marta.
We'll get a start as soon as it's light.
- Steve.
- Yes?
I wish you'd give all this up and come back to the States with us.
Well, I can't promise you that, but I will be back sometime.
Do you mind if I say
I think you're a swell person?
Hmm?
Well, after that, things happened pretty fast.
The next victim was my native overseer, Ali.
The same fashion as the doctor.
Marta went to bed that night.
We were all pretty jittery and...
Marta!
Babe.
When we got there, they'd disappeared.
Obviously, there was some sort of secret passageway.
I remained to search for it and Babe looked around outside.
The mummy, apparently, had broken an urn in passing.
And I examined the fragments and found a clue.
There was a secret passageway.
Steve!
Marta, what happened? How did you get here?
The mummy brought me here. He's alive.
Yes, I know.
Pop. Is he all right?
He's all right. Just a little shaken up.
Meanwhile, outside of the temple...
See here, you Egyptian Mickey Finn.
I'll give you three to tell me where she is. I'm not kiddin'.
We've gotta get you out of here in a hurry.
He's after tana fluid.
That's what must be in this vial.
And in the urn, Steve!
It's full of the fluid.
You mustn't let him get it.
Keep him away from it!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Well, I got Marta back safely, all right.
Brought back the body of the Princess Ananka, too.
But I've always regretted I wasn't able to bring back the mummy with her.
You can well imagine what a contribution to science that would have been.
The monster was really alive, walking and breathing?
Absolutely.
It's beyond the imagination.
The most amazing thing I've ever heard.
Why, it's like hearing from a world beyond.
That's the way it happened, and if Marta were alive today she'd tell you the same thing.
Nobody that ever went through an experience like that could ever forget it.
Well, at least I have the satisfaction of having destroyed a terrible monster, and in doing so, rid the world of an awful curse.
Thirty years ago, an infidel sought to destroy me and to destroy Kharis.
Both attempts failed.
The bullet he fired into me only crushed my arm.
The fire that sought to consume Kharis only seared and twisted and maimed.
Open it.
Kharis still lives...
Lives for the moment he will carry death and destruction to all those who dared violate the tomb of Ananka.
That moment has now arrived.
Once each night, during the cycle of the full moon, you will dissolve three tana leaves and give the liquid to Kharis.
Three leaves will keep him alive.
Nine leaves will give him motivation.
And now I leave in your hands the curse of Amon-Ra and the destiny of Kharis.
Preparations are complete to the last detail.
A position as caretaker of the little cemetery at Mapleton has been arranged.
Now swear by the sacred gods of Egypt that you will never rest until the last remaining member of the Banning family is destroyed.
Until they all have suffered the fate of those who dared to defile the tomb of our royal dead.
Swear that you will never betray your trust.
I swear by the mighty power of Amon-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world, and by the dread horror of Set,
I shall never forsake my trust as a high priest of Karnak.
And now, O mighty gods of Egypt, may you find in this young follower a successor worthy in every respect to carry on the sacred trust now delivered into his hands.
And save him from any temptation that might destroy him.
As it nearly destroyed me.
The ways of my people are strange to Western minds, but it is my duty to offer prayers each night, so that the soul of my dear one is not left alone to wander lonely and forgotten through the spaces of time.
Certainly. Anything we can do to...
No, there is nothing.
It is simply that not a single word may be uttered in the presence of Occidentals.
Very good, sir. You can count on me, sir.
I shall see that you're not disturbed, sir.
Thank you.
We are on our way, Kharis.
Now nothing shall stand between us and the fulfillment of our vows.
Nothing, Kharis. Nothing.
- How do you do?
- Good evening.
- You the new caretaker?
- Yes, effendi.
They wired me and said you'd be here.
I expected a much older man.
It's very peaceful here. I think I like it.
But it's such a lonely existence.
It seems strange to me that a young fellow like you would want to tie himself down to the job of a caretaker.
You see, there is a difference in our philosophies.
Here I continue close to the one
I admired and loved in life.
Have it your own way. I'm not complaining.
You understand what you have to do here.
- Yes, I understand thoroughly.
- All right.
I'll be getting along. Good-bye.
Bye, effendi.
Three tana leaves to keep him alive, nine to give him movement.
Kharis.
Kharis.
Kharis.
The moon rides high in the sky again, Kharis.
There is death in the night air.
Your work begins.
What was that?
I don't know.
Let's go home. I'm scared.
Vic. Vic.
Mmm? What's the matter?
There's something outside.
I seen it go by the window.
Seen what?
I don't know, but its shadow crossed my face.
- Ain't nothin' out there.
- I seen it, I tell ya.
I'm gonna phone the Sheriff right now.
Hello. Sheriff speaking. What do you want?
A shadow? You wake me up for that?
Go on back to bed. You must be crazy.
Whoa! Whoa!
What's the matter with you? Quiet down!
You're kind of cramped for space, aren't you, son?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Well, here goes.
You know, that's just perfect.
Even if you didn't ask me, as a checker player, I'd say you're a darn good doctor.
Three games in a row ought to prove something.
Yeah.
Yeah, it proves it's 11:00.
Ooh, I'd better be getting on home.
And I'd better be getting to bed.
You should've been there an hour ago.
That's what you get for having an older sister.
Now, Stephen, don't you start talking about ages.
- What's the matter with them?
- I'll run out and see.
- You go to bed, Dad.
- All right, son.
I'll be back in a minute,
Isobel, to take you home.
- Good night, Jane.
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Isobel.
- Good night.
King! Silver! Quiet, boys!
What's the trouble with the dogs, Jim?
They don't bark like that for nothing, Mr. John.
Something must have frightened them mighty bad.
Kharis!
Why, that... That sounds like Stephen.
Wait here.
He...
He's dead.
One is gone, Kharis.
One who dared defy our ancient gods.
Three remain... Only three.
And then we can return to the land that gave us birth.
Ah, this is just a waste of time.
Those marks left on his throat were nothing but dust.
You're the coroner and you should know.
Still, it might lead to some clue.
It's worth checking on.
I've tried to compare this with specimens of clay and dirt from all over this territory.
Seems to be nothing like it around here.
This is just another one of those fiend murders.
What reason would anyone have for doing such a thing?
You can't call it a fiend murder and let it go at that.
I don't intend to, John.
We'll do everything we can.
- Just let us handle it.
- All right, Sheriff.
Go on.
Well, you see, we were...
We were parked along the west county pike and...
What time was that?
Well, it must've been a little before 11:00.
We were listening to Jan Garber on the radio.
That's right. Then all of a sudden, a shadow passed over us.
What sort of a shadow?
Well, I don't know. Just a shadow.
Didn't you see what made it?
No, sir. We didn't look up right at once.
And when we did look, it was gone.
- All right, you can go.
- Yes, sir.
I'll send for you if I need you again.
- Vic.
- Yeah.
You called me about seeing the same sort of shadow.
I seen it. It passed right over my bed.
I seen somebody pass by the window, too.
- What did he look like?
- I don't know.
The moon was behind him.
He just kind of looked all black.
Anything else?
When we looked out, whoever it was, was gone.
Okay, Vic, I'll see you later.
I've covered a lot of murders, this is the first time I ever had a shadow for a suspect.
Might as well let the reporters in.
Yeah? What are you gonna tell them?
I don't know. Maybe they can give me a lead.
Okay.
Oh, John, are you still at this desk?
I've checked through every person that ever contacted him.
I still can't find anyone who would have reason to...
Look, John, you can't spend the rest of your life doing detective work.
All right, Auntie.
You're the boss around here.
What would you have me do?
Stop neglecting your practice.
Go down to your office and...
My dear, since this thing's happened, you've forgotten her completely.
I guess you're right, Auntie.
Of course I'm right.
You go on out there. Spend the day with her.
It'll do you both some good.
All right.
It's wonderful being with you again, darling.
Aunt Jane told me you'd called, but since that night
I've had so much on my mind.
Oh, I understand, John.
O mighty gods of Egypt, may you keep up my strength to carry out the mission entrusted to me.
Strength to resist any temptation which may be thrown across my path.
Strength to fulfill the destiny of Kharis.
I was wondering when he'd get here.
When does the train arrive?
Around 11:00, I think.
I'll run down and meet him.
You needn't wait up.
Oh. I certainly shall wait up.
Babe was always one of my favorites.
Suit yourself, Auntie.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
Now go, while the moon is still high in the sky.
Death goes with you.
Am I glad to see you, Babe.
I came as fast as I could, John.
How's Jane?
Oh, fine, considering.
Come on, get in. We can talk on the way home.
Very well.
That's everything we know.
Haven't been able to find a motive or reason or anything.
- Not a clue nor nothing?
- No.
Oh, yes, yes, there was something, but nothing came of it.
What was that?
A kind of grayish mark on Dad's throat.
Must've been a powerful hand that strangled him.
What did you say?
Kind of grayish mark on Dad's throat.
Clay or dust or something.
Grayish mark.
A grayish mark.
Quiet, King. Quiet, Silver.
Jim!
Jim!
Jim!
You are back, Kharis.
Now you can rest.
Rest until the moon is high again in the sky.
Two are dead and two remain.
It's no use. Hemiplegia.
Take a look.
It's a form of paralysis caused by severe shock.
Jim. Jim.
Don't you know me?
Can't you remember anything?
If there's any change, will you please call me?
I will, John.
All right, Babe.
Hey, look who's here!
Hi, boys, how are you?
Hi, Lefty, Joe. Hi, Peoples.
Well, Frank, don't tell me they sent you out on this assignment.
Yep. Had my choice of covering the Russian front or this.
I picked this.
Look, John, your father has told this story over and over.
Sure. When I was a kid.
He used to tell me fairy tales, too.
Yes, but this is different, and you know it.
Thirty years ago, your father and I met up with this curse in Ananka's tomb.
It wasn't imagination either.
We saw that curse bring on death.
We thought we'd destroyed the mummy in the fire.
Maybe it escaped, or maybe there was another one.
Oh, Babe, it's ridiculous.
Even supposing you were right, what would it be doing around here?
Where would it hide?
If those high priests could keep a man alive for 3,000 years, they certainly could figure out the rest, too.
Oh, Babe, listen...
The only clue we have are the dust marks on Dad's throat, and now on the throats of Aunt Jane and Jim.
It's not dust. It was mold that came from a mummy.
All right, Babe. Have it your way.
We can't go on arguing all night.
- John, will you do me a favor?
- Certainly.
Leave Mapleton. Go as far away as you can, as quickly as you can.
Why would I do a thing like that?
Because you're next in line.
The curse on that tomb extends to the blood relations of all the men that entered it.
- Then you're included.
- Suppose I am.
I'm an old man. You're...
Now, Babe, I've known you ever since I could walk.
I'd do anything in the world for you.
But I'm a doctor.
I can't believe in a live mummy.
Where are you going?
I'm going to find someone that will listen to me.
Someone that will listen to me before it's too late for all of us.
There was a gray mark on the throats of every single person killed in this town.
I know that.
And that mark wasn't mud and it wasn't clay.
It was mold.
We'll look into it, Mr. Hanson.
And we certainly appreciate your coming in like this to tell us about it.
Don't you believe me?
Well, now, you see...
Yes, I know.
You're a doctor, too, like John Banning.
A heart and lungs couldn't last
3,000 years. Go on, tell me that.
As a matter fact, I was just about to say those very words.
All right, don't believe me.
And don't do anything about it.
Wait till more murders are committed.
Look, Mr. Hanson, there are dozens of reporters here from all the metropolitan papers.
A number of them are razzing Mapleton about the revival of witchcraft.
I know that.
What would they say if I was to tell them that a mummy, 3,000 years old, was doing all the killing?
They'd laugh us out of office.
What will they say when they find out that I was right?
And that I tried to tip you off?
Give me a beer, will you?
Yes, sir. Coming right up.
Excuse me. Aren't you Babe Hanson?
- That's right.
- I'm Jake Lovell, New York Record.
How are you?
Suppose you're down here because of all the trouble.
Maybe.
Too bad about Mr. Banning and his sister, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Any idea what's behind everything?
I know what's behind it.
- You know what?
- I know all about it.
Only nobody will listen to me.
Look, friend, if you're after a listener, you don't need to look any further.
Now, what's this all about?
Well, it started 30 years ago when Steve
Banning and I discovered Ananka's tomb.
- Yeah, what's that got to do with it?
- Everything to do with it.
That tomb was guarded by a live mummy.
We saw it. We fought it.
You mean to say...
You think a mummy's been doing all these murders around here?
I know it was a mummy.
What a yarn.
It's gonna be a tough baby to sell my editor.
Give me all the details.
Well, at that time
Steve and I were young men.
Steve was interested in archeology.
I know. I know. I've heard that laughingstock routine before.
Now what do you want me to do?
Sure, the whole town's afraid of their own shadows.
I'm following up on it. Good-bye.
Sheriff!
It's out again. I just saw that shadow.
I saw it with my own eyes.
You saw a shadow. What else did you see?
- I didn't wait for anything more.
- That's fine. That's a great help.
Well, you don't think for a minute
I was taking any chances?
- Where did you see it?
- I was walking along High Street...
Come on. We're going back to High Street.
I've written hundreds of news stories, but never in my life...
The killer! He's out again!
He just frightened Nick Landsford down on High Street.
The Sheriff and he are down there now!
Thanks, Babe. See you later.
Kharis!
He's dead.
Look.
What is it?
I'm not sure, but I think
I know someone who can tell me.
Darling, will you drive me to the university?
- I want to see Professor Norman.
- Of course.
I'll call him and tell him we're coming.
Be out in a minute.
All right.
This powder, which you say was scraped from the gray marks on the victims' throats, is mold.
- Mold?
- Yes, mold.
Developed through so many centuries that it's almost impossible to calculate.
Hmm...
It's the same we find in this strip of linen.
What makes you so sure?
Well, in the first place, there's a distinct scent common to both of them. Smell it.
It's undoubtedly the odor of myrrh.
Comes from a tree known as the Commiphora abyssinica, which grows only in parts of Africa.
So?
This reddish brown resin is myrrh.
The other test tubes contain cedar oil and sodium carbonate.
Now, all those substances come from this strip of linen.
Look.
You can see that mark where the linen has been partially eaten away?
Yes, yes, I know. But what's it all about?
Where does it come from?
That mold and this strip of linen both came from the body of a mummy.
The chemicals were used for embalming.
There's no doubt about it.
That inky hieroglyphic there is the same that's found on the body of the Princess Ananka.
It dates back almost about 3,000 years, to the reign of King Amenophis, her father.
But...
Whether you are ready to accept it or not, we are dealing with the presence of the Living Dead.
Then Babe was right, and we wouldn't listen to him.
Well, now you've seen the evidence.
We've got to accept it.
Living or dead, I'm going after it, whatever it is, now that I know what to look for.
Come on.
- Telegram for Mr. Banning.
- Oh, yes.
Thank you.
The commission's just what I wanted.
But coming at a time like this...
I think it's wonderful.
Just what you've needed, something to get you away from here.
Nobody else could reason with you.
But there's one thing certain.
You know the army won't wait.
Three days. Hardly gives me time to get my affairs settled.
If you have any things that need attending to, I can take care of them.
- You?
- Sure.
You didn't think for one minute I'd leave without taking you with me, did you?
Well, you've just proposed and answered yes all in one breath.
Oh, Isobel, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so abrupt. I...
Now, don't go spoiling it by saying any more.
We'd better get started.
I have a million things to do.
Wedding preparations and all that.
John, maybe we'd just better go down to the judge's office in the morning.
Oh, no, we'll have it at home, in memory of Dad.
He'd have wanted it that way.
All right, John.
Kharis.
Kharis, come here.
They think there will be a marriage and an heir to carry on the blood of the Bannings.
They think that, Kharis.
This time, Kharis, I'm sending you upon a different mission.
One of life rather than of death.
You are eternal, Kharis.
Earthly pains and sickness cannot touch you.
Like the age-old hills of Egypt, you exist, you are.
The ancient line of the high priests of Karnak must minister unto you until the end of time, Kharis.
I shall do that for you, Kharis, I.
I am going to take on to myself a wife, Kharis.
A wife. Do you understand that?
The one...
The one who is supposed to be the bride of the last of the Bannings.
The one whom it was ordained I should find.
Turn around, dear.
Mmm-hmm.
There, I think that's it.
What do you think, Ella?
Oh, she looks beautiful.
How fast they grow up, though.
Are you sure you can have it ready for tomorrow?
Oh, heavens, yes! There isn't much to do.
A dart here and there, shorten the sleeves.
You're about the same size your mother was when she was married in this dress.
- Am I, Mother?
- Mmm-hmm.
Who knows?
Maybe someday I may be making this dress over for another young bride.
- Oh, you never can tell.
- Well, good night.
- Good night, Laura.
- Good night, Laura.
Together we three, until the world crumbles and there is no longer a stone or a rock, or a tree or a blade of grass.
That is my will, Kharis, and you shall obey it.
Bring her here.
Go!
Go.
You've been happy, haven't you, Mother?
We'll talk about that later.
It's time now you were in bed.
Vic. Vic!
There's that sound again. I'm scared.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Mother.
Sleep well.
All right now, men. I've asked you to meet me at the Banning home because we've got a terrible job on our hands.
And it's gonna require every bit of courage we've got to see it through.
Whether you can believe it or not, the facts are here, and we've got to face them.
A creature that's been alive for over 3,000 years is in this town, and it's brought death with it.
We've got to run it down.
Thirty years ago, my father discovered and violated a sacred tomb in Egypt.
Did I hear you say something about Egypt?
That's right.
I've been out to the graveyard, Sheriff, and I was talking to the caretaker about a final resting place for myself.
Yes?
And the caretaker spoke all about Egypt and quoted a lot of passages from his Egyptian Bible.
Then when I heard you talk here tonight,
I thought maybe he knows something about it.
John! John!
Oh, John! John! Isobel!
The monster took her away!
- Isobel?
- Yes.
John, give out those clubs.
Give out the torches.
Come on, men, get your torches.
Where am I? What are you doing?
There is nothing to be afraid of.
Nothing will hurt you ever again.
That creature.
Kharis? You have nothing to fear from him.
He has brought you here to me because it is your destiny to achieve the greatest honor that can come to a woman.
You will become the bride of a high priest of Karnak.
No. No!
For you, I'm going to forsake the teachings that have been handed down to us for generations upon end.
The secret that has kept Kharis alive all these years can be ours as well.
You're mad.
After I have given you the tana fluid you will be immortal, even as Kharis is immortal.
What I can do for you, I can do for myself.
You will bear me a son, and he will be brought up in the confines of the tombs of Egypt, even as I was brought up.
A new priest of Karnak who will carry on the ancient and honorable line.
No.
John and I, tomorrow, we're going to be married.
There will be no marriage between you and John Banning.
The sins of his father are upon his head, and only death waits for him, as it has for the rest of his family.
For he who despoils the ancient tombs of Egypt must die.
One day you will thank me for this.
Over here.
Kharis.
Take her out and hide her until I get rid of these fools.
Let's go in!
Open that door! Open that door!
Come on!
Open up! Open up in there!
Get something to break this door down!
Quiet! Quiet, men!
There's the man we're after.
- You gentlemen wish to see me?
- Yes.
You've some explaining to do.
What have you done with Isobel?
With whom?
Up to now, I've only asked questions.
Do I have to use another method to make you speak up?
Well?
I know nothing of any such person, effendi.
The mummy. Isobel. Through the woods.
- Banning!
- Well?
For those who defile the temples of ancient Egypt, a violent death shall be their fate.
Come on, men, let's go.
Over there!
If the mummy tries to get away, stop him with fire.
Watch the back stairs.
Don't let him get away.
Isobel. Isobel!
John.
I'm so glad we managed to sneak out while the folks are celebrating.
Hey!
Hello, boys.
Any old tires you don't want?
The only old tires
I got I'm riding on.
Look, I didn't have money to go to the circus,
But not enough for the sideshow.
Save your money.
Plenty of freaks around here.
Hey, you think they got all the things they say they have?
Sure, the man told us.
Bet they ain't got no lions.
They have too!
The man let us see them.
He did?
Good thing they ain't got no teeth.
Sure they have!
Long as anything.
Let's you and me go see them.
You can go ahead.
We're going swimming.
Say, we're going past doc
Adrian's house, ain't we?
Sure.
We going right by the front of the house?
Sure.
What's the matter?
You scared?
I ain't scared of no crazy doctor.
Well, if you're coming, come on!
Wait, wait, you see, it's this way.
I got to get home for dinner
Or mom won't let me go to the circus.
All right, so you're afraid.
Well, you'd better stay here.
Get out of there, you little rotten...
Oh, no you don't!
Come on now.
Gee, look, he's got Willy.
Hello.
I can't understand why they don't do something
About doc Adrian.
Destroying all the values in this town,
Giving red creek a bad name.
Well, I think so, you're right, Mason.
He ought to have been run out of this town a long time ago.
Who ought to be run out of the town, Mason?
Dr. Adrian.
You should have been with us this afternoon.
He scared the women so bad they haven't got over it yet.
Yeah.
This town's too healthy.
Maybe he'll scare himself a couple of patients.
Understand them big doctors make a lot of money on
Nervous women.
It wasn't funny
When that epidemic broke out, Quinn.
You know as well as I do, he used a lot of those patients
As Guinea pigs.
I know nothing of the sort.
I know he did everything he could.
Two or three in this town wouldn't agree to that.
However, I can understand his reason for wanting
Patients now.
Well, he got himself another this afternoon.
Little Willy over there.
He ran after me, hurt me, and I wasn't doing nothing.
Poor child.
I think you're all yellow.
She's right.
And none of you got the courage to do anything about it.
Patients die on him, and now he's hanging around
Ms. Clifford's house experimenting with frances,
I guess.
You make a poor critic, Mason.
Your greed hasn't done this town any good.
What are you doing, preaching?
A little preaching wouldn't do you no harm.
What, with the people you squeeze dry and the usury
You charge on your loans.
Oh, I don't ask them to borrow!
I guess there's an answer for that also,
But I think it'd be wasted on you.
Business is business,
Quinn, and you know it!
Besides, we weren't talking about me.
Why don't we kick the doctor out and be done with it?
I'm ready any time you want to get started.
Oh, yes, that prescription.
I'll fill it in a second.
Been quite busy this morning.
I'm sorry to delay you, doctor.
Perfectly all right.
I can fix it myself.
It's none of my business, and maybe we men of science
Think different from other people, but if they
Ever find out in the village what you've been doing...
You mean about the animals?
Yes, some of the dogs have been missed.
Well, that phase of the experiment is all over.
I found out all
I need to know.
Can I help you?
Don't you think they need you in the store?
Just as you say, doctor.
Just as you say.
Well, that's good.
Enjoying the last of the summer?
Oh, doctor.
Doctor, sit down.
Thank you.
Oh, how's my girl today?
Oh, you're all dressed up.
Well, Danny phoned.
He's coming over.
So early?
He can't come tonight.
He's going to the circus.
Oh, yes.
The circus.
I almost forgot.
I've got a present for you, frances.
Oh, for me, doctor?
Well, now, don't get too excited.
Oh!
Just you wait
'til you open it.
It isn't anything at all now.
A jewelry case.
Oh, doctor!
Oh, it's beautiful!
But why so much, doctor?
You gave me a birthday present last month.
So I did.
Well, this is a make-believe birthday,
Just as you're my make-believe daughter.
Was she very like me?
She'd have been just 18 today.
She was to have worn that.
I couldn't save her, and I couldn't save her mother.
I hadn't the weapons to fight the disease that
Killed them, but I have now, or at least I've got
A knowledge of them.
10 years it's taken me.
Frances, you are going to walk again.
You're so intense, you frighten me sometimes.
So Danny's going to the circus, huh?
Yes.
Then he's coming back here afterwards and tell me all
About it.
Oh, he is, is he?
Well, why don't you go with him?
Oh, me?
Do you think she could?
- Oh, you're fooling.
- Why, of course she could.
I don't know why she shouldn't.
Hello, everybody.
Oh, Danny!
- Hi, doctor.
- Hello, Danny.
Hello, Ms. Clifford.
Well, Danny, how would you like
To take frances to the circus?
Well, gee, that'd be great, only...
Why, of course she can go.
We can take care of her.
I'll be back for you later.
Oh, thanks, doctor.
Now, don't you worry, Ms. Clifford.
Two strong men to look after her.
She'll be all right.
I'll be back later.
Goodbye, doctor.
Danny, I think you'd better run home and get
Yourself cleaned up.
You look as if you've brought all of the grease
From the garage with you.
You know, frances,
I think the doc's crazy.
I suppose I'll have to like him as long as he's nice to you.
He wants to be nice to everybody,
But people won't let him.
Well, I'm not saying
I believe all the things that...
Don't you believe any of the things they say
About him, Danny foster.
Well, all right, don't get excited.
Look, Danny, the stories they tell about the doctor
Are just as dirty as the grease on your hands and face.
Well, that about takes care of me.
So long, honey.
Goodbye, Danny.
Stay with it, doc.
Don't let it throw you.
Careful.
- There you are.
- There.
- Oh, that was easy, wasn't it?
- All right, frances?
- Oh, yes.
- All right. Right.
Okay.
Well, this time next year,
It'll take three men to lift you.
Oh, not three men, doctor.
If it did, they'd want to keep me in the circus.
Hop in, doc.
Oh, no, you can get somebody else at the circus
To help you lift her down.
What's the matter?
Aren't you coming?
- No, you two go on by yourself.
- Oh!
Now, you don't mind if
I change my mind, do you?
Oh, please, doctor.
You'll have much more fun together.
Off you go.
And don't forget to tell me all about it in the morning.
- We won't.
- So long, doc.
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye, doctor.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, mother.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, darling.
Have a good time.
Bye.
- Goodbye, doctor.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, mother.
- Goodbye.
Oh, come, come, come now.
This is no time for tears.
I know it.
I can't help it.
Ah, nonsense.
The change will do her a world of good.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Well, we made it.
Hey, did you see him, Mickey?
- Who?
- The gorilla.
Did you really see him?
Yeah, in the sideshow.
He's a big fella.
Is he bigger than three men?
That ape?
That ape is bigger than six men.
Six big men.
It's the biggest ape gorilla
In the whole world.
Look!
Here come the clowns!
Having a good time?
Yes.
You don't act like it.
Gee, everybody's looking at us.
I'm nervous.
What for?
Well, out with a married man and, you know.
Gee, this is the best circus I ever saw.
It's the only circus I've ever seen.
Get them while they're hot!
All right, officer.
Popcorn!
Right hot out of the oven!
Excuse me, Sonny.
Peanuts, five cents a bag!
Isn't she lovely?
She's so graceful.
Ah, she's not so hot.
I saw her passing the garage this morning.
Them costumes make a big difference.
That's what the doctor calls muscular grace,
Muscular coordination.
Honey, look over in that ring there.
See?
There you are.
You're all right now.
You'll be chasing bones in the morning.
What I've done to you I could do for man if they'd let me.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
That's all, honey.
I'm sorry it's over.
We'll never miss another circus.
What are you trying to do, drive that animal crazy?
Well, he's getting mean.
It's the only way
I can handle him.
You ever try a little kindness?
Nothing wrong with him.
Nabu.
Come here, nabu, old boy.
Come on now.
That's it.
Oh, two years ago,
He killed my old man, and I ain't gonna let him forget it.
Understand?
I know he did.
I was right here when he did it.
'Cause he was abusing him same as you're doing.
If you don't watch your step, he'll get you too!
Why don't you mind your own business?
You boys wouldn't be gambling, would you?
- Oh, no.
- Never.
Take me in.
That was a fine show you fellas put on.
You was the funniest clown I'd ever seen.
Oh, I rode a horse.
He was the clown.
- He was?
- Yeah.
Boy, he looks like a judge.
Hey, Jim, Pete, let's give them a hand.
Come on!
We can't handle it!
Sound an alarm!
Get the animals out!
Where's the nearest doctor?
Dr. Adrian.
Get something to put him on.
We'll take him.
Get him on there!
Somebody better get after that ape,
Or he'll tear this town wide open.
Pete, get a posse together.
Come on, boys.
Let's see what we can do about that fire.
A man badly hurt.
Sorry to bother you, doctor.
Bring him in here.
Come on, right here with him.
Oh, what happened?
An ape got him.
An ape?
Hope we scared him off in time.
This man's badly mauled.
You better get him into my laboratory.
Jane, you show them.
Well, now how did it happen?
Was he in the cage with the ape?
No, the circus burnt down, and the ape escaped.
The circus burned down?
And the audience?
They'd all gone home.
Oh, thank heaven for that.
Well, will you want us any further, doctor?
No, I'll take care of him.
Well, then come on, boys.
Let's get out and see if we can find that ape.
Don't let him get at me, mister.
Don't let him get at me.
You're perfectly safe here.
I'm a doctor.
Am I hurt bad, doc?
I'm afraid so.
I don't feel nothing.
Am I gonna die?
We all have to die sometime.
Oh, just don't let me die, doc.
Man.
The highest kind of animal.
Hey, doc, what are you gonna do with me?
I'm going to write you into medical history.
I'm going to keep a promise.
Wait here.
Keep your eyes open.
That sheriff ain't got no heart.
I'm so hungry,
I could eat hay.
Well, there's a barn full.
Help yourself.
George, you take your fellas,
And search the country up around cartier's farm.
Jim, you take your boys, and cover the West Side of town.
Pete, you stay with me.
All right.
How about joining them, Mason?
Let the circus people do their own work.
Why should we do it for them?
Well, the circus has burned down.
They've had trouble enough.
Well, that's their tough luck.
Well, if we don't find that ape,
Our own people might get hurt.
That's your job.
You're law and order.
And why should I worry about other people?
They don't worry about me.
You wouldn't be a little bit scared, would you, Mason?
Huh!
Well, don't be all day about it.
We're ready.
It gives a body the creeps to think of that critter
Roaming around.
Better keep the doors and windows all barred.
No telling who he'll go for next.
Are you all right, dear?
Mm-hmm.
Want some more?
What you thinking about?
I was thinking about that wonderful woman aerialist
I saw last night.
Oh, here comes Dr. Adrian.
Morning, Ms. Clifford.
Good morning.
Frances.
Oh, good morning,
Dr. Adrian.
I want to thank you again for the wonderful time I had
Last night.
Uh-huh.
It was too bad about that trainer, wasn't it?
Now, don't you think about him.
This is the most important day in your life.
Today we are really going to start her cure.
I found the serum that I need.
I'm going to walk, Dr. Adrian?
I hope so.
I'm not just thinking about you, frances,
But of all the sufferers in the world,
All the little boys and girls who can't go out into
The sunshine and play and have fun,
Who have to spend their lives in a wheelchair like you.
I'll do anything
I can, Dr. Adrian.
I know you will, my dear.
It's not going to be easy.
It's going to hurt, but when it hurts, don't be afraid.
Just remember that when the pain is gone,
It'll leave new life behind.
Huh?
I think we better get her ready.
All right, doctor.
Now, we've got him here and there and here.
Now, we don't get any results tonight,
We'll start in here and work west.
Oh, change your mind, Mr. Mason?
I never change my mind.
You got to have one first.
That's enough out of you!
Here's that dispossess orders on wilcox.
I want it served tonight.
We're busy tonight.
It'll wait 'til tomorrow.
Your duty is to take care of the citizens of this town!
Not fooling around chasing apes!
It seems you're in a mighty big hurry to make
People uncomfortable, Mason.
It's my business what I do.
Fine!
And it's mine what I do!
We'll get to this when we have time.
Goodnight.
Oh, doctor.
- Well, frances...
- Oh, my legs.
What?
They feel like lead.
I can't lift them.
But you never could lift them before.
Oh, I know, but I never felt them before.
You feel them, frances?
You feel them?
They're so heavy.
Well, that's good news, my dear.
That's what we were hoping for.
And it's only just the beginning.
If there's any change, you send for me immediately.
Yes, doctor.
Oh, mother.
Jane!
Jane!
Jane!
Look.
I succeeded.
It's there.
Life.
Life in that tiny bottle.
It's working.
The child will walk again!
Just go.
It's wilcox!
He's all torn up!
Ooh, we better get a doctor.
It ain't no good.
He's been dead for hours.
Let's notify the sheriff.
Right.
Doc!
Doc!
Hey, doc!
Yeah, what's wrong?
The ape's got wilcox!
Is there anything I can do?
No, no.
He's deader than a doornail.
Better be careful, doc.
Thanks.
I will.
Yes, Jane, you're safe.
But only you and I must know that he's dead.
Goodnight.
My legs hurt quite a little, Danny.
I know now Dr. Adrian is really going to cure me.
Well, if they hurts you, how can you be getting better?
Oh, you don't understand, Danny.
They never hurt before.
There was no feeling at all.
Now they feel alive.
Just the same,
I don't like it.
I don't like things
I can't understand.
Well, I don't understand either, Danny,
But I believe in him.
Oh, I have so much faith in him, Danny.
He says I'm like a daughter to him,
And I know he wouldn't hurt me, unless he had to.
It's part of the cure.
It's just got to be.
All right, I'll try to believe too for you,
But I'd rather carry you around all my life than have
Anything happen to you.
Hello, sheriff.
Any luck?
Not yet, but we'll get him.
Well, I hope so.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
There.
It looks like they picked up a scent!
Whoa!
Well, what got into him?
Hold on to him a minute, will you?
Yeah, you bet ya.
Hello, doc.
Haven't seen anything of that ape, have you?
Well, no,
I haven't sheriff.
Well, my dogs just acted
As if they've picked up a scent.
Well, I'd better be careful then.
Yeah, you better be.
Having trouble with insects, doc?
Yes, this is just a little mixture of my own I'm trying
To get rid of them with.
Well, if it works, let me know.
My yard's full of them.
Certainly will.
Thanks.
Henry, supper's ready.
Oh, you're going out?
Yeah.
Oh, but I made lamb stew with dumplings.
I don't care for lamb stew and dumplings, thank you.
Besides, the sheriff wants us out early to capture that ape.
You needn't lie.
I know where you're going.
Oh, you do?
Yes, everybody does.
So you've been listening to gossip, huh?
I can't keep people from talking to me and telling me
You found a new interest.
Suppose I have.
There's nothing I can do about it, I guess.
Keep that in mind.
But if you just wouldn't carry on here where we live
So people would stop pitying me.
Even if you go somewhere else!
Why don't you try going somewhere else?
But I have no one but you.
I have no folks.
I've got no place to go.
You've got the river!
Poor Mason,
I feel sorry or his widow.
Ah, she's better off.
Ah, that ain't funny when a man's been clawed to death.
I didn't like him when he was alive,
And I don't see any reason to like him when he's dead.
Just the same, it ain't right,
Even if he was no good.
We got to give that ape credit.
He only picks out the ornery cusses.
What makes you think you're safe?
Well, boys, you got yourselves some rest today?
About 40 winks.
We're plum tuckered out.
Well, maybe we can get some more people in to help us out.
Why don't we go out in the daylight?
Because he don't come out in the daytime.
The circus people told us we'd never get him then.
We got to catch him prowling after dark.
Think he's still hanging around the village?
He got Mason, didn't he?
And we found new tracks up around Dr. Adrian's house.
Oh, give me a sarsaparilla.
Quiet you.
Well, what do you think of that, sheriff?
Even the dogs don't like him.
Well, what got into them anyway?
Acting the same way around his house.
Don't make sense.
Maybe it's 'cause the doc
Looks so much like an ape himself.
This is no time for joking.
All of you be on the job tonight.
I'm scared, Ms. Clifford.
She looks almost... I'm really scared.
We must trust Dr. Adrian.
But we don't know.
He ain't got a patient in this town.
People don't hate a fella for nothing.
Do you hate him, Danny?
No, it's not hating him.
It's loving frances the way I do.
If anything happens to her...
I'm going down to see him.
I got to ask him.
I got to know.
Danny.
Danny's worried, isn't he, mother?
Now, you just rest, dear.
Danny will be all right.
Oh, if my legs didn't hurt so.
But I'm not afraid.
You aren't, are you, mother?
No, darling.
I want my little girl to walk again.
You ain't going in there, doc.
Now, what is this, Danny?
I'm scared about her.
I got to know what you're doing!
Well, surely, you want her to live a normal life like
Other people.
Well, sure, as long as nothing happens to her.
I love her just the way she is, doc.
I can take care of her.
I want to take care of her!
I don't want no experimenting on her!
But Danny, if through her
I could rid the world of...
I'm not in love with the world!
I'm in love with her!
I get it.
She's just a
Guinea pig to you.
Well, you got to stop it!
You got to stop hurting her!
Have you been to your garage today?
No, I ain't.
I've been too worried.
Well, you take care of your cars,
And I'll take care of my patients.
Now, just you run along.
I ain't running no place.
I ain't no doctor, and I don't know enough about what
You're doing, but if anything happens to frances...
Nothing's going to happen to frances.
Now, don't interfere.
Here comes Danny with the doctor.
How do you do, Dr. Adrian?
Ms. Clifford.
And how is my patient feeling this morning?
I'm all right.
She's been in great pain, doctor.
In pain?
Well, that's good.
- Good?
- Of course it is.
That's what we're looking for.
Now, you prepare her.
It's working.
- You say the name is Mason?
- Yeah.
Yes, doctor, initial h.
Anything in your examination to go into my report?
No, I believe not.
Well, I just said the death was caused by
A fractured vertebrae.
I guess that about covers it, doesn't it?
Yes, I should say that it would.
The reason I have sent for you, doctor,
Is because you examined the circus trainer when he was
Sent north.
And this case being a similar one to that,
I thought probably in your examination that you had
Discovered something that I had overlooked to put in my
Coroner's report.
I see.
This Dr. Adrian who's name is on the death certificate,
Is he the local physician?
Yes, if you can call him one.
Folks around here don't like him much, though.
And he was also called in on the case of the trainer?
Yes, yes, that's the same fellow.
He came here during the paralysis epidemic,
But the folks around here say that he experiments too much.
Thank you very much, coroner.
I believe you've given me all the information necessary.
That's fine, doctor.
Oh.
Oh.
Frances, what do you feel?
Oh, my legs.
They're hurting?
Oh, they hurt terribly.
Do you have more sensation than you had yesterday?
Oh, yes, much more.
Do you think perhaps you could walk?
Oh, no.
Then try to move your foot.
- Oh, I can't!
- You can!
Try!
No!
You can!
No!
You can!
No!
You can!
Oh, mother!
Oh!
It's working.
Oh!
Now you rest.
You rest, and I'll be back later.
Mother,
I know I'll be able to walk again.
I know, baby.
I know.
Dr. Adrian.
That's right.
I'm Dr. mcnulty from the Robinson foundation.
Oh, yes.
I had occasion to examine the body of a circus trainer
Who was killed by an ape here in this town.
Yes, sir.
I understand that you administered to the wounded man
Before he died.
I did my best for him, but it was quite hopeless.
In spite of the spinal injection you gave him?
I gave him no injection.
I just came from viewing the body of this man, Mason.
And I noticed a similar spinal puncture.
Did you examine him also?
Well, they called me in, of course,
But it was too late.
He was dead.
And you noticed no such puncture?
Well, the body was so badly mangled that...
Well, no, I didn't.
I see.
I understand they've had an epidemic of paralysis here.
That's true.
Many years ago, the
Robinson foundation found it
Necessary to expel from the institution a most promising
Young research worker because of his daring,
Unorthodox experiments with spinal fluid.
It was 25 years ago to be exact.
Then you are that
Dr. Bernard Adrian who's
Definite theories...
And in spite of what you did to me,
For 25 years, I've been engaged in proving those theories.
By what method have you been doing this?
I'm not in a position to disclose that at the moment.
I see.
Well, I'm afraid you leave me no alternative
But to report...
Wait.
If I could give you some small measure of proof,
Will you change your mind?
I doubt it.
Let me show you.
I'll show you.
You see, now, these two creatures were completely
Paralyzed, but after my treatment, well,
You can see for yourself, they're as lively and
Healthy as ever they were.
All this has nothing to do with the case.
But it has.
The serum that I used...
What became of the serum you took from those two men?
Now, you come with me.
Oh, doctor.
Hello, Ms. Clifford.
Now, this is Dr. mcnulty.
How do you do, doctor?
I would like to talk to frances.
She's asleep.
No, I'm not asleep, mother.
Hello, frances.
Hello.
Now, this child has had a complete paralysis of her
Lower limbs for 10 years.
Is that right, Ms. Clifford?
Yes, it is, doctor.
Have you had any feeling at all in your limbs since
Dr. Adrian has been treating you?
Yes, they've been terribly heavy,
And I've had a great deal of pain.
Pain?
Yes, and just a little while ago, I moved my foot.
Is that right?
That's right.
Will you do it again for me?
I can't.
Make an effort.
I can't.
Thank you.
That's all.
I think you'd better take her out into the sunshine.
Is anything wrong, doctor?
Why, no, frances, dear.
Of course not.
Well, her foot did not move,
But I did feel a definite muscular reflex.
Congratulations.
May I notify the foundation that you'll come back to us?
It's too late.
I have to stay here.
At least give me your promise to keep us informed
Of your progress.
Every step of the way.
Thank you.
It's not finished.
It's not finished.
Gee, look fellas.
Do you see something?
Yeah.
Do you have to wait until you see the white of his eyes?
Maybe they ain't white.
I'm gonna take a chance and shoot now.
Oh!
Oh!
Come here, Willy!
I don't care how busy you are, Jeff halliday.
I want my Willy found!
The idea of him wandering around in the dark with that
Gorilla loose!
Which none of you men seem able to capture.
Oh, it's all your nephew's fault!
He's always leading my little Willy astray!
But he's always under Mickey's heels!
Oh, ladies!
We've got work to do.
Your kids are just someplace where they shouldn't be.
Well, it ain't nothing new.
Have you looked down in Jones' barn?
I caught them smoking there last week.
We've searched the whole town.
Go take a look for them, Pete.
They ain't far away.
Sheriff!
Sheriff!
Where have you been?
We got him!
We got him!
Whoa, whoa.
What is it?
Mickey killed him and shot him dead.
Bang! Bang!
Between the eyes!
Hold it, kids.
What'd you shoot him with, Mickey?
My .22.
I got a good bead on him.
Where's your .22, Mickey?
He dropped it, sheriff.
I did not!
The ape grabbed it!
I'll ape you when
I get you home!
Ah, gee, ma, don't you believe us?
Where'd you see him?
On the pike about a quarter mile from doc Adrian's house.
All right, get them home.
Come on, Mickey.
Come on, Willy.
We're going home right now.
Come on.
Get out.
They probably shot a cow.
Yeah.
I'll look into it.
Where are the dogs?
Red's got them over on the other side of town.
All right, let's go.
Wait a minute, boys.
I want a word with the doctor.
I'll be right out.
Okay.
All right.
Is the doctor in?
Yes?
Sheriff.
Good evening, sheriff.
Just wanted to see if you were all right.
You ain't been out, have you?
No.
I'm trying to think out, doctor, a lot of things.
That ape seems to take a fancy to your place.
Now, don't take offense, doctor.
I'm just trying to clear up my mind.
Them dogs of mine have been sniffing the ape for days.
It's made them foolish, I guess,
Else why'd they snarl at you?
There may be some chemical odors on my clothes
That offended them.
Uh-huh.
But I ain't never seen my dogs offended at anything.
Can't understand it, doctor.
No.
Wait a minute.
Jane, just get me that torn coat of the trainer's,
Will you?
Now, this is an idea that's just occurred to me.
I don't know whether it makes sense or not,
But perhaps it will explain your problem.
You see, this coat was worn by the trainer when he was
Mauled by the ape, and it's been in the house ever since.
Now, that perhaps explains the interest of the ape in
This house and your dogs in me.
Now, then,
I'll bet you're right.
Well, I'll get along.
I think I'll put a few men around your house the rest
Of the night, doctor, just so you'll be protected.
Don't bother.
I'm perfectly safe.
They might interfere with some work that I have to do.
Well, maybe I'll just keep an eye out myself.
I'm just a bit scared, doc,
But don't tell anybody about it.
What's that?
This here is the coat that trainer was wearing when
The ape killed him.
Boy, did he rip that up.
One swipe.
Well, come on now, boys.
This isn't getting us anywhere.
We lay down on this job, our own coats will be in the
Same shape.
Come on.
Let's get busy.
All right, sheriff.
Now, you fellas get back to your positions.
- All right.
- You boys go up this way.
All right, sheriff.
I'll stay here.
I can't fail.
I can't fail.
Now, frances, dear, I want you to forget all the hours
You've spent in this chair.
Put them out of your mind.
You're not paralyzed.
You never were.
Fasten that firmly in your mind.
You're not paralyzed!
You'll do that for me?
I'll try.
Don't forget, you are not paralyzed!
Now, move your right leg.
Move it!
You can!
- No, I can't.
- Try! Try!
Stop it!
You're hurting her!
- I can't, Dr. Adrian.
- Quiet!
Try it, frances!
You can!
You know you can!
Move!
There!
You moved it, didn't you!
You moved it!
Now the left one!
Now the left one!
Now move it!
Try!
Try again!
There!
You moved them!
You moved them both, didn't you, dear?
All right, then, stand up and take a step towards me.
Do it!
Do it!
It's only your mind holding you in that chair,
Not your body.
Do it, I say!
Do it!
You see?
I told you.
Go get her some water.
Oh, she's all right, Danny.
She's better than she was, isn't she?
She needs more.
She needs more.
Take care of her, Danny.
I'll be back.
Oh, frances, darling.
Frances.
Name is halliday, sheriff over at red creek.
I had a job finding you.
Well, circus jobs are pretty hard to get, sheriff.
Well, all jobs are kind of scarce.
Your boys get that ape yet?
That's what I come about.
Didn't get him, huh?
That's bad.
He's a killer.
You boys got some responsibility tracking him
Down, haven't you?
Well, we did the best we could, sheriff.
The fire broke up the circus.
Some of the boys stayed there, didn't they?
Yeah, but that's not what I come about.
I just figured when you're looking for something,
It might help to know its habits.
Too many things about this animal I don't understand.
Well, animals is all alike.
Lions, elephants, dogs.
They all got one-track minds.
What do these gorillas live on?
He ain't killed any animals.
Shucks, no, they won't touch an animal,
Except out of meanness.
They live on fruits, vegetables.
Well, that's what's bothering me.
What's feeding this fella?
Maybe digging up a garden, a patch or two,
Or just eat a little bit of fruits.
No signs of it.
Checked with all the farmers.
Do they prowl around much, or do they stick in one place?
Well, a gorilla generally sticks to one place if he's
Got anything there to keep him.
We see evidence that this fella's
Hanging around one place.
That ape had it in for the trainer.
Where'd he die?
In the house of a doctor near the outskirts of town,
And that's the place we think
The ape's been hanging around.
Say, how would he trace the trainer to that house?
Well, sense of smell.
They're pretty good at that.
Did you bury him in town?
No.
We sent his body to his people up north.
That don't give us much, does it?
Any of his clothes around?
When that trainer was taken away,
His coat was left in the doctor's house.
Would that draw the ape there?
It certainly would.
You better get rid of them.
I was afraid my time might be wasted coming over here,
But I guess it ain't.
Thanks very much, Mr. howley.
I better be getting on the road.
I like to make home around nightfall.
Anything I can do for you, let me know.
Two injections should have been enough.
Take this record book, and keep it for me safely.
One more.
One more.
Pete, you two boys go over there by that shrub.
Danny, take your men down there
100 yards by that rail fence.
Okay.
Ah, sheriff, we've been watching there every night,
And so far nothing's happened.
Now, I'm getting... will you take orders?
All right.
All right.
You two boys go over by wilcox's barn.
Hey, you mean wilcox's barn?
Yes, wilcox's barn.
All right.
You two boys go down the road 100 yards.
You two wait for me over at that stone fence.
All right, sheriff.
Is the doctor here?
You sure of that?
He's not in there?
Say, sheriff, what's the idea of sticking around so
Close to the doc's house?
Because that attendant told me that ape would haunt
Any place where that trainer had been.
Oh.
Hey, what's getting into that sheriff?
He's getting touchy.
Lost his sense of humor.
You know, when a man can't laugh, it's just...
Hey, George, isn't this where we found the body?
Mm-hmm.
Do apes ever return to the scene of the crime?
They're noted for it.
Well, we got something to look forward to.
Ugh!
George!
George!
George!
What's the matter?
It got me.
Fire shots.
Come on!
Did you hear that shot?
Yes, but you told us not to leave here.
Where was it?
That way.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Did you fire that shot?
Yes.
It's tom.
The ape twisted his neck, but I didn't see nothing.
Can you walk?
Pick him up and carry him to the doctor.
No, I'm all right.
Go on. Get him!
He can't be far way.
Come on! Get out!
Get out with you fellas!
You boys come with me.
Doctor!
Look out, doctor!
It's the ape!
The ape!
Doctor, the ape!
Doctor!
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
Doctor!
Dr. Adrian!
Doctor!
Oh, let me go!
Don't stop me!
No, no, frances.
I'll see what's happened.
Frances!
Let me give him one, sheriff.
Hold on, that's enough!
He's done.
What are they doing?
What are they saying?
Oh, darling, I don't know!
It's the doc.
All right, boys, take that off of him.
Let me through!
Did the ape hurt him?
Let me through!
Let me through!
Dr. Adrian!
Frances.
Come to me, child.
Walk.
Walk.
There.
You see?
He's dead, boys.
Oh!
Hello, Danny.
No, wait, Danny.
Honey, you mustn't overdo it.
I'm doing better every day, Danny.
Oh, sure.
You're doing swell, but you got to take it easy.
I'll get your chair.
No, Danny!
Mother and I burned the chair yesterday.
I'm never going to use it again.
You bet you won't.
- It's in there. Number nine.
- Right.
Don't stand around.
Go on home, all of you.
- What happened, constable?
- Well...
- there's been another murder.
- A murder.
There's nothing you can do.
I told you to go home. Go on.
Oh, just a minute, miss.
Are you alone?
You work out at the Warren home, don't you?
That's nearly two miles from here.
You'd better hurry if you're gonna get there before dark.
- Got any ideas who did it, constable?
- Yeah.
Same fella did the first one.
Same fella did the second one.
But who he is, I don't know.
Somebody in this town.
Somebody we all know.
Somebody we see every day.
Might be me. Might be you.
Why, how could...? I mean...
- I was here at my desk, anyway.
- Oh, be quiet.
Didn't know you was called,
Dr. Parry.
I wasn't. As I was leaving the office,
I heard about the murder.
Thought I'd see if there's anything I could do.
Well, there ain't.
Unless, of course... you're good enough to uncork a miracle... and bring the dead back to life.
I don't think I'm that good.
There's no sense in you going up.
She's dead, all right.
Dr. Harvey's up there, and that's what he says. She's dead.
Well, in that event, constable,
I certainly can't do her any harm.
- Hello, Parry.
- Dr. Harvey.
There's nothing for you to do, unless you're sightseeing.
- How was she killed?
- Strangled.
- She was dead when we got here.
- Who was she?
That lame girl that worked over at Nelson's.
How awful.
She was just in my office last week.
Did she pay her bill or was this her way of getting out of it?
I haven't enough experience to make that sort of joke.
Perhaps not, Dr. Parry.
- I'll run along.
- Oh, just a minute.
I hear you were over to see Mr. Stover last night.
- Yes, I was.
- Don't you know he's my patient?
I only went because they called me.
They told me that you'd refused to go until morning.
- I thought it might be serious.
- You've got a lot to learn, young fella.
You've only been here a short time.
I've been here for a good many years.
If I answered all the calls as they came, I wouldn't get any sleep at all.
Well, that's why I think there's room for two doctors in this town.
Reckon so, but let the competition be on an open plane. Ethics.
You get what I mean, Parry?
If ever I'm called on an emergency, and you're sleeping...
I intend to go.
That's very noble and ambitious.
Don't let anything discourage you.
Nothing will.
Oh, by the way... you might like to see what the Stovers did... to that prescription you wrote last night.
I'm gonna make some calls, Helen.
I'll take you to the crossroads.
Were you at the hotel?
Wasn't a very nice thing to have happen on your afternoon off.
I've been pretty busy lately.
I haven't had much of a chance to drop in and see you.
But I've been thinking about you a great deal.
You haven't any family, Helen.
No one else to worry about you.
And I got to wondering just how long you were going on like this.
I mean, doing the work you're doing at the Warrens'.
You wanted to be a nurse or a teacher.
You mean, you're going to give up that... without making an effort to get your voice back again?
Yes, I know, Helen, you did see a doctor once.
That was a long time ago.
They might have discovered a lot since then.
There are specialists in Boston now.
I don't want to build your hopes up, Helen... but it seems such a shame to give up so easily.
You'd rather I wouldn't talk about it, wouldn't you?
All right, I won't.
You know the words to that tune?
Dr. Parry.
Dr. Parry.
- Hello, Freddy.
- Pa's sick, Dr. Parry, bad.
They didn't send you for me?
Ma sent me for Dr. Harvey, but Pa wants you to come.
I'm afraid I can't help you out this time, Freddy.
You don't understand.
Your father's Dr. Harvey's patient.
We'll have to try and find him for you.
I'll call him as soon as I get home.
Oh, please, Dr. Parry, you come.
I want you to come.
All right, come on, get in.
We'll go up and have a look.
I'll run you home afterwards.
Afraid you'll be late?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
You'll go straight home, won't you, Helen?
Oh, it's you. Thank heavens.
They phoned us about the murder.
For a while I thought it might have been you.
It's terrible. That's what it is.
Horrible.
As if it isn't bad enough murdering people... but all these defenseless women.
First there was the girl with a scar on her face.
Then that poor simple-minded creature... and now this cripple.
It seems like...
I guess you've had enough for one afternoon.
Now... Now, get your wet shoes off before you catch your death.
And you'd better get up to Mrs. Warren straightaway.
She's raising a rumpus with that nurse of hers again.
Won't even allow her in the room now.
She sent down word for you to go up the moment you came in.
Is that someone at the front door?
Who's there?
I don't understand.
I closed that window when the storm started.
I'll get a hammer and fix that shutter.
It was him!
Carleton, bad dog!
Out all day and only home in time to get under my feet and break my...
You're a no-good loafer, that's what you are.
Criminals and murderers loose... and you're out courting the neighbor's dog.
Oh, Carleton, Carleton, you deserve a good beating.
Guess I better dry you first.
You'll catch your death of cold, that's what you will.
And if you think this is all
I've got to do, you're mistaken.
I think I better fix that window first.
And I hope that Carleton is all that came in.
I won't need you.
You'd better get up to Mrs. Warren.
Helen?
Haven't you gone in to Mrs. Warren yet?
Hurry along, will you?
It's about time. Mrs. Warren's been asking for you all afternoon.
She won't let me do anything for her. Oh, no.
I'm ordered to sit out in the hallway.
Why in the world am I kept on here... to nurse someone who can't stand the sight of me?
But then, I can't stand the sight of her either.
I've nursed some queer ones in my time... but she's got them all beat.
She's sly too.
Even with her eyes shut, she seems to be watching you like an evil spirit.
But get in there before she gets herself into another tantrum.
I got him before he got me.
The tiger, I mean.
I was as good as any man.
You're not only late, but you're playing games.
Why are you so late?
Never mind. Never mind.
Come here.
I hoped you were never coming back... that you'd run away.
Leave this house tonight if you know what's good for you.
You understand?
Who's there?
I told you to sit in the hall.
Why must you spy on me?
I'm not spying on you.
It's time for your medicine.
- Helen can give me my medicine.
- I don't know what I'm being paid for.
You're being paid to sit in the hall.
That's all you're good for. Get out.
That was the constable at the front door, professor.
He wants to see you.
I've asked him to wait in the living room.
Thank you.
- Put these in order, will you?
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, constable?
- Yes, Professor Warren?
I'll be with you in just a moment.
Blanche, get these ready as quickly as possible.
Yes, sir.
- Hello, constable.
- Hello, professor.
- Wouldn't you like to sit down?
- Oh, no. No, thanks.
You sure got a lot of interesting things here.
- What's this?
- That? Plant life.
You mean to say you can write a whole book about...
- little stuff like this?
- Yes.
What did you want to see me about?
Oh, a couple of things, professor.
I hate to bother you at this time of night... but I figure it's important enough.
You know, there's been another murder.
Yes, so I've heard.
What I want to say is... that we've traced the murderer to this vicinity.
- Are you certain?
- Yes, that's why I've come here.
That's why I'm asking everyone to be careful.
Keep your doors and windows locked tonight.
Well, I'll see that your orders are carried out, constable.
I'm especially worried about that girl who works for you.
- Helen?
- Yes.
You see, every one of those girls murdered... had something the matter with her.
Something wrong.
You mean some sort of an affliction?
Yes. Now, my hunch is that this murderer, whoever he is, is...
I understand exactly what you mean, and I assure you... that I shall be especially careful about Helen.
As a matter of fact, I'll see that somebody is with her at all times.
Good.
Oh, you scared the life out of me, Stephen.
I didn't hear you come in.
Don't stop typing.
How many times have I asked you not to see me when I'm working?
It's so embarrassing.
- Please, leave me alone.
- I can't stay away from you.
Now, when am I going to see you, and where?
You're not going to see me at all if you don't let me finish this.
But I'm so bored. I don't know what to do with myself.
Stephen, you're going to get us into trouble. Now, please go.
No.
Then I'll just have to finish this some place else.
Oh, Miss Blanche.
Yes, Mr. Warren.
Stephen.
You remember my stepbrother?
I sure do. Haven't seen you in a long time, Mr. Warren.
Heard you were back. How'd you leave things over in Europe?
I left everything in order.
They like you to.
- Paris must be quite a town.
- Yes, it is.
Lots of beautiful women.
From what I've seen, they're not so bad here either.
Always wanted to go there myself... but I've been married since I was 16.
Never had a chance.
Must be pretty exciting.
I understand it's been pretty exciting here for you too.
- Oh, yes, it has been at that.
- Wish there was something I could do.
- Don't think there is.
- Stephen... the constable wants to know if anyone left the house today.
Nothing personal, I assure you.
I've been asked to check up on everybody.
I haven't been out all day, constable.
That's all I wanted to know.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Don't forget to lock your doors.
I won't.
His stepbrother gave him an accusing look.
Oh, professor, could I see you for a moment, please?
Would you mind calling him?
He doesn't know me.
You're not afraid of him, are you?
- I'm sure he loves policemen.
- I'm not in uniform.
All right, Carleton, go away.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
Anything wrong, Albert? Professor?
I just stopped by to tell them the same thing I told you in town today, Oates.
- See anything on your way home?
- Nope.
- Well, good night, professor.
- Good night.
- Your hat, Oates.
- Oh, yeah, keep forgetting.
Come along, Carleton.
Evening, Helen.
Helen, I want to talk to you a moment.
Now, Helen, I don't want to frighten you... but because of what happened in town... we have to be especially careful for the next few days.
If you should see anything outside of this house, or even in it... that makes you suspicious,
I want you to let me know.
See that someone else does your outside work.
You stay in the house.
And don't hesitate to come to me at any hour if you need help.
Now you may go up to my stepmother, if you wish.
Helen... remember what I told you.
Don't trust anyone.
Leave the fire alone, Helen.
Pack your things, leave this house tonight.
Too many trees... stretch out their branches... knock the window... try to get in.
When it's dark, they move.
I've seen them.
Creeping up to the house.
Go away, my dear.
You're such a little girl.
I want to take care of you.
If you won't leave the house as I... I ask you to... you must sleep in this room tonight.
Don't be afraid of me.
I wanna take care of you.
You see... you're not safe, my dear.
Oh, leave me alone.
You're worse than Nurse Barker.
Stop fussing.
If you won't leave the house as I ask... the least you can do is to leave me alone.
Go over there and sit down.
Sit down.
Stay where you are.
I don't need your help.
Mind your own business.
Helen, what is it?
Mother must be worse. Get Albert.
Give me the brandy, Helen.
It's empty. Is there any more?
Give me the ether, then.
Don't stand there, give me the ether.
Why did you have to come back, Stephen?
- Why didn't you stay in Europe?
- Mother.
There's always trouble when you come, Stephen.
Always trouble.
Why didn't you stay away?
I want Dr. Parry.
- Dr. Parry?
- Yes.
You said you didn't want him here anymore.
You and Albert decided that.
I want Dr. Parry.
Mother, we've given him a chance.
You haven't improved any.
I'll never improve with that ancient Dr. Harvey.
Stupid girl. It's all your fault.
You brought on this attack.
She deliberately refused to let me have my spectacle case.
Mother, Helen wouldn't have any reason for refusing to give it to you.
Never mind, never mind.
We won't talk about it anymore.
Get out now, both of you.
Go and call Dr. Parry.
Will you be all right?
After all these years, you ask me if I'll be all right.
Oh, Stephen.
Get out. Take that ether with you.
Well, Mother, I can see that you're feeling better already.
I don't like that ether.
I don't think it does any good.
But Dr. Parry and Dr. Harvey explained to you... that, taken in small quantities, it's a stimulant rather than a depressant.
It did help you, didn't it?
There's been another murder, hasn't there?
Nobody told me.
Nobody had to.
I always know everything.
Oh, Blanche.
Oh, Blanche, if you don't come here
I'll come over.
Yes, I'll come over
Yes, I'll come over.
Pale hands I loved beside the Shalimar.
Now, now.
Oh, Steve, I'm so unhappy.
Stephen.
- Where were you this afternoon?
- Why?
- Those are mine.
- I know.
So you've unmasked me.
Well, I don't know whether
I've unmasked you or not... but I don't know why you told him you weren't out when you were.
Well, to be honest, I didn't want to discuss it in front of anyone.
Well, how stupid of you.
If anyone had seen you, you would have made it awkward for all of us.
Where were you?
- Professor, I...
- Blanche... would you be good enough to leave us?
Let's stop sparring.
You're angry because
I took Blanche out.
You're angry because since I've been home...
Blanche and I have gotten to know each other pretty well.
You know, Stephen, you always did smirk... even when you were a child.
It's one of the things my father disliked about you.
He was my father too.
I'm inclined to think that Father was disappointed in both of us.
Neither of us fitted his concept of what a real man should be:
A gun-toting, hard-drinking, tough-living, God-fearing citizen.
He always used to say:
"The strong survive, the weak die."
How wrong he was, Albert... because you and I... the meek... have inherited the earth.
I'll be honest with you, Stephen.
I don't like you. I never have.
I have never trusted you.
And you're quite right when you say that I don't like... this interest you have in Blanche.
And I'll tell you something else.
I've had the responsibility of your mother, not mine... for years, and I'm tired and strained.
Therefore, I think we should make a decision.
Either you make up your mind to go away permanently... or, if you like, you stay and let me go.
Helen... you look as though you lost your best friend.
You got nothing to worry about.
If anybody tried any of their funny business on you...
I'd soon sock them in the jaw.
Look at it this way, Helen.
Murder's like a million-dollar lottery.
Sure, it is. Listen.
You pick up the newspaper.
You see someone's picture who's won a million dollars.
You pick up another paper.
There's a picture of someone who's been murdered.
But it's never me and it's never you.
It's always somebody else, isn't it?
There's safety in numbers, Helen.
There's Oates and me and the professor and Stephen.
- We'll look after you.
- And there's Carleton too.
Shouldn't count too much on him.
And there's Nurse Barker.
She'd be as good as any man.
In fact, sometimes
I think she is a man.
In case you're interested... there's someone at the front door.
- What do you want?
- I was called to see Mrs. Warren.
It's Dr. Parry. Was he called?
Hello, Helen.
I suppose they called
Dr. Harvey first.
You mean Mrs. Warren asked for me?
Well, I've got me a patient now.
I'm glad I was called, Helen. I've wanted to have a long talk with you... and I'm going to before I leave.
- How are you, Dr. Parry?
- I'm fine. How are you, Mrs. Warren?
Did you know my husband?
No, I didn't, Mrs. Warren.
Of course not. He died years before you came here.
You're a little like him.
Firm step, strong hand... good eyes.
Thank you. I know you were very fond of him.
He told me I wasn't as beautiful as his first wife... but I was a much better shot.
The only kind of beauty he had any respect for was strength.
And he had two sons... both weaklings.
They hated guns and hunting.
He used to run away from them, Dr. Parry.
Well... he got his release from a bottle.
And he died as he lived, happily, extravagantly.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no. You mustn't be.
You mustn't be sorry for him.
You should try to get some rest,
Mrs. Warren.
Yes, I know. I talk too much.
I talk too much.
- Get Helen out of this house.
- Why?
Because I know you love her.
Take her away.
Promise me you'll take her away from here. very well, I promise.
Take her away tonight.
If it's money you need,
I'll get it for you.
Get me the ether, Helen.
Did you get it?
I'll go ask Nurse Barker.
Come in, please, nurse.
Will you get me the ether?
Helen can't find it.
It was used about an hour ago.
Where did you put it?
Let's have another look.
It's gone, and you're the only people who have been in this room today.
- Unless Mrs. Warren...
- You took the ether, Barker.
Why, I did no such thing.
You always make me sit outside.
Never mind. Maybe
Professor Warren will know about it.
I'll go and see him.
Here, where's my brandy?
I finished it for your own good.
Well, I wish you'd stop doing things for my own good.
With everything that's happening, it's better that you keep your wits.
I'm never more witty than when I've had a little nip.
I see better, I hear better, and I feel much better.
Oates, would you mind coming out a moment? Bring your hat and coat.
There it is.
Emma, let's be serious for a minute.
I want you to stay awake until I get back.
Keep an eye on Helen.
I won't be long.
I could keep a much better eye on Helen if I'd had a little nip.
I can't understand.
Ether was used less than two hours ago.
Stephen used it.
He said Helen gave it to him.
Unfortunately,
I have no other supply.
Oates, I'm afraid you'll have to go into the village for some ether.
It's stormy out.
Does it have to be done?
If it didn't have to be done,
I wouldn't ask.
All right, all right, I'll go.
He won't find any in the village.
I tried to get some.
I have to go to Morristown.
It'll take hours.
I'm sorry, it's an emergency.
We have to have it.
You're sorry, but I have to go.
You should have some other stimulant at hand.
- Brandy? I'll get a bottle.
- That will do.
- Will you ask Helen to come for it?
- Yeah.
Mrs. Oates.
Yes, sir?
Come along with me while I get a bottle of brandy.
Yes, sir.
Oh, dear, now I've done it.
- Did you bring a match?
- No, sir.
Oh, well, never mind.
Perhaps I have one.
Here we are.
I think it rolled over there, sir.
I'll take it this time, Mrs. Oates.
Your key, sir.
Oh, my.
Did I put one over on him.
Easy as taking candy from a baby.
Take a tip from me, Helen.
If you carry the candle to the cellar for the professor... and you fancy a bottle of his fine old brandy... just throw the candle to one side.
Accidentally on purpose, of course.
Anything can happen in the dark.
Presto.
Now, I'll just wipe this off... and you can take it to Dr. Parry.
Helen.
Come into the den.
I want to talk to you.
Mrs. Warren's asleep.
Professor Warren's with her now.
I've been thinking things over.
And Mrs. Warren's right.
You should come with me tonight.
You can stay at my mother's place... until we can make arrangements to go to Boston.
My mother will like you.
I don't wanna frighten you, but you heard Mrs. Warren a while ago.
Her mind's growing steadily worse, and I'm afraid she may become violent.
She seems obsessed by the idea that you get out of this house.
And there may be something back of it.
You'll go with me tonight.
There are doctors in Boston who'll know all about your case.
I want to take you there.
Helen.
When I left you this afternoon,
I dropped in at the Fabers'.
They have a guest visiting them from your hometown.
A Mrs. Lindstrom.
You know her?
Well... she told me a story about a girl.
A girl who was on her way home from school one day.
She had good news for her parents.
When she wasn't far from her home... she heard a fire engine rushing down the street.
She started to run, and when she turned the corner... she saw that it was her home that was in flames.
There was a crowd outside.
She wanted to scream herself, but somehow she couldn't.
She tried to rush into the house... but was held back because it was hopeless.
So without being able to do one thing to help... she saw her mother and father burn to death.
I'm sorry, Helen, but I had to do it.
It's only because
I wanted to help you.
Go over everything that happened that day.
Have the courage to see it all again.
And by not blocking it out of your mind, you may find your voice again.
I don't like being an outsider, and you shouldn't either.
I know what I'm talking about because I'm an outsider here myself.
A lot of people don't want me.
They want me to quit.
But I won't, because there's at least one person who wants me here... and that's good enough for me.
And there's one person who wants you to talk... and that ought to be good enough for you. Look at me.
Look at me.
Remember how wonderful it was when you had a voice?
When you could say "hello" or "thank you"?
When you could yell back at someone picking at you?
I do it all the time.
You look at me as though you don't believe it, but I know I'm right.
Try to talk! Try it! Try it!
Excuse me.
My mother is asking for you, Helen.
I'll speak to Professor Warren about your leaving.
What is this about Helen leaving?
I'll discuss it with your brother.
Is it something you can't discuss with me?
Why is she leaving?
Where is she going?
Well, I've been doing a great deal of thinking about Helen.
I know her condition is due to shock.
I'm sure a new mental therapy can restore her voice.
I'd like to take her to Boston.
Aren't you taking a tremendous responsibility?
Building up her hopes.
Making her think there's some miracle in store for her.
It's up to her, not you.
What you're doing is cruel and foolish.
That girl is adjusted to her affliction.
I think you should let it go at that.
Suppose you let me mind my own business.
It so happens I don't think much of your business, Dr. Parry.
If there is a solution to her problem... it ought to be in the hands of someone other than a hick doctor.
The thing that keeps me from cracking you in the jaw... is the almost certain possibility that it would break your neck.
What's the trouble, doctor?
The good country doctor, having lost his wits... was about to resort to his fists.
Professor Warren, I know you're interested in Helen's welfare.
I've told you what I've learned.
I've decided it's for her best interest...
- that she leave here tonight.
- Tonight?
She can stay at my mother's until we can take her to Boston... for the examination first thing in the morning.
Doctor, you know that I agree with you... about the element of hope that you have for Helen... but what's your reason for suddenly making her leave tonight?
Well, Mrs. Warren feels... that she's in danger here.
Surely you don't take the ramblings of a sick woman seriously.
I take most things seriously.
But, doctor, there are many other considerations.
Helen needs this position.
It's her only means of support.
No family. It won't be easy...
I've thought of all those things, professor.
I...
I intend to take care of her.
Oh, I see.
Well, I'm very glad for you and for her.
You're a sentimentalist, doctor.
Are your humanitarian instincts restricted... only to people with serious afflictions?
You're very insolent.
Dr. Parry.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes, he is. Just a moment.
- It's for you, doctor.
- Thank you.
Hello?
Helen... the Wilson boy is sick.
I have to go over there.
Now, here's their phone number.
You can pack while I'm gone.
If you need anything before
I get back, have Mrs. Oates call me.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Be sure and bar the door behind me.
And don't let anyone in but me.
Wilt thou obey him... serve him... love, honor and keep him, in sickness and in health... and forsaking all others... keep thee only unto him... so long as ye both shall live?
Signify by saying, "I do."
Say, "I do."
Say, "I do."
Say, "I do."
Say, "I do."
Say, "I do."
Say, "I do."
Say, "I do."
Say, "I do."
Say, "I do."
What's the matter, Helen?
Don't you feel well?
I understand you're going to leave us.
Well, I don't know whether
Dr. Parry is right or wrong... but I agree that you should have that chance to go to Boston.
And I want you to understand if things don't work out satisfactorily... that you're always welcome to come here.
Now, you run along.
I like to see women cry.
Men like to see women cry.
It makes them feel superior.
Oh, Steve...
I'm very unhappy... and upset.
You dramatize everything, Blanche.
We've been very happy.
At least, I have.
- I don't like your attitude at all.
- I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm... I'm making trouble between you and your stepbrother.
I don't like to hide anything I feel.
And you know how I feel about you.
That's very sweet of you, Blanche.
But are you sure you're telling me the truth?
Truth about what?
Just that I think you're uncomfortable because of your... past relationship with my brother.
- You are a...
- Don't say it.
Just answer my question.
Get out.
Don't be so melodramatic.
I didn't realize you were so strong.
I'm leaving here.
I never want to see you again.
I'll miss you.
A house like this needs charm.
I told you to get out.
You're going to regret this.
I'm sorry to intrude, Helen.
I have a favor to ask of you.
You're leaving tonight, and I want to go into town with you.
I'm happy for you.
Things will be so different when you're cured.
I don't know what will become of me, but I've got to leave this house.
It hasn't been good for anyone here.
I'm only taking a few things with me.
Oates can pick up my other things tomorrow.
My suitcase is in the basement.
I'll only be a few minutes.
This is the second time
I've closed that window tonight.
I definitely know I did.
Now, if only I knew who opened it.
You're not that clever, and if you were...
Oh, it's you.
You scared the life out of me.
I told you not to touch me. Get out.
I'll get out, Mrs. Warren.
Not only out of here...
- but out of this house.
- Good riddance.
But before I go, you're going to hear a few things.
I'm tired of being a target for an evil old woman.
Nobody's asking you to stay.
If you got down on your knees, I wouldn't stay.
- I don't need this job.
- Why don't you go?
You need a keeper, not a nurse.
I don't care if you never walk again.
You can stay in that bed for the rest of your life.
I've taken everything, but I'll not put up with this.
I'm leaving this house tonight.
I'll soon clear them out.
I hate nurses. Always fussing.
Always washing your face.
Helen.
Did you know there was a girl murdered here a long time ago?
I saw it.
Upstairs, from the window.
It was getting dark.
I thought it was a tree in the garden.
Stood so still... and waited.
Then when the poor, simple-minded creature came near the house... the tree moved... threw her into the well.
I was too late.
I couldn't find the rope.
You were that girl, Helen.
Come here.
Come here.
You must go away.
Leave this house.
Go with Nurse Barker tonight.
Don't wait for Dr. Parry.
Don't wait for anyone.
If you won't, you must do what I tell you.
You must get under the bed.
Do you understand?
You must hide under the bed.
Why won't you do what I tell you to?
Why won't you listen to me?
Why won't anyone listen to me?
Would you mind letting me have a wagon?
I'll leave it in the village for Oates to pick up. very well. I'll go out with you and hitch up the wagon.
You're very kind, professor.
I've been walking.
- In this rain?
- Yes.
In this rain.
I wonder if you'd mind doing something for me, Stephen.
What?
Nurse Barker is leaving us.
And as long as you're already rather wet... perhaps you wouldn't mind hitching up the wagon for her.
Everybody's leaving the old homestead.
Like a holiday.
- It'll be a pleasure.
- For both of us.
- Goodbye, Professor Warren.
- Goodbye.
Oh, Helen, will you tell Blanche
I want to see her in the den?
Have you been here long?
I was outside with Nurse Barker.
I saw the basement door open.
Did you come in that way?
Helen... you must forget everything you've seen here.
Let me handle this.
Do you understand?
Take the candle.
Come with me.
You don't think I did it.
Wait.
I think I have a match. Yes.
Where could it go?
Hey, there it is.
Helen!
Helen!
Let me out of here!
Helen!
Number, please.
Hello.
Number, please.
Hello. Number, please.
Helen.
Helen.
What on earth are you doing?
What's the matter?
"Blanche murdered"?
"Stephen."
Where?
I'll take you up to my stepmother's room.
You stay there with her.
I'll call the constable.
Let me take care of things now.
You've been through enough.
You tried to telephone, didn't you?
Well, I'm glad you couldn't.
You looked in this mirror once before today.
I watched you.
You had no mouth then.
Just as you have none now.
Look at yourself.
Look.
And there's no room in the whole world... for imperfection.
The only person who could have prevented you... from achieving the quiet that I can give you... was Stephen.
And you locked him up... downstairs.
We're quiet now, Helen.
I'm glad I waited.
Everyone's out of the way.
Mrs. Oates is drunk... because I purposely let her steal a bottle of brandy.
And Oates... he's gone to look for ether... because I made sure there was no ether.
And Blanche... whom I loved... didn't love me... so she had to die.
She's dead and at peace.
And Stephen... you took care of him for me.
Stephen is weak... as I once was.
What a pity my father didn't live to see me become strong.
To see me dispose of the weak and imperfects... of the world, whom he detested.
He would have admired me for what I'm going to do.
- Who is it?
- It's me, the constable.
I met Dr. Parry in town.
He said he won't be able to pick Helen up tonight.
The boy is very sick, and he has to stay there.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll tell her, constable.
Well, I'll be on my way then.
Good night.
Helen!
Helen!
Helen!
Helen!
Helen!
Murderer.
Helen!
You killed them.
You killed them all.
The servant girl in the well.
The others in the town.
Today, the cripple in the hotel.
You killed them all.
Tonight, it would have been Helen.
I heard you.
Stephen.
Get me Stephen.
Now it's been done.
Ten years too late.
No.
Forgive me, Stephen.
I thought it was you.
He always waited till you came home... so I thought it was you.
A doctor. Get Dr. Parry. Hurry!
One... eight...
Come.
It's I, Helen.
SON OF DRACULA
- How are ya, Doctor?
- Hello, Harry.
Hey, Charlie.
Hello, Dr. Brewster,
Mr. Stanley.
How are ya?
Say, are those all the passengers you had?
Just the four.
You didn't put anybody off at the wrong station, did you?
We're here to meet a friend of the Caldwells, a Count Alucard.
There was no count on this train.
All customers.
Say, there was a lot of stuff in the baggage car that might belong to your count.
Thanks.
We'll take a look at it.
[Man]
All aboard!
Well, does this look as though he's come to stay for just a couple of weeks?
No, it doesn't. I wonder what's become of him.
Probably coming by car.
Don't worry. He'll show up.
- "D-R-A-C..."
- What are you mumbling about?
Nothing, nothing.
Just a silly idea hit me.
Well, if there's no Alucard, there's no need of our waiting around here.
I've got to get back to the office.
- Is that you, Matthew?
- Yes, ma'am, Miss Kay. This is Matthew.
I brought the trunks and boxes, but Mr. Frank... said the count didn't come on the train.
Oh. Well, put them in the guest house as I told you.
Yes, ma'am, but I have to have some help.
They're amazingly heavy.
Then get some of the other boys to help you.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Come on, Sam.
Come on.
Matthew's back from town.
Oh, did the count come?
No, not yet.
If you only had a phone,
Frank would have called after the train arrived.
Believe me, if I still lived here, I'd have one, even if I had to string the wires myself.
There are other means of communication.
Oh, please, Kay.
No lectures on metaphysics tonight, huh?
You should allow your mind to explore the unknown, Claire, then you wouldn't laugh at telepathy.
I know Count Alucard will be here tonight, without benefit of telephone.
Oh, he probably missed the train and will come down tomorrow.
I must run in and see Dad for a minute before I dress for the party.
See you later, huh?
[Frogs Croaking,
Birds Squawking]
[Mumbled Chanting]
[Mumbled Chanting
Continues]
[Squawking]
You do not know why you came here tonight.
It was because
I wished you here.
W-Well, why?
Isn't Count Alucard...
I wished you here to warn you.
The angel of death hovers over a great house.
I see it in ruins... weeds, vines growing over it, bats flying in and out the broken windows.
But I want to know of Count Alucard.
Is he coming?
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me, Queen Zimba?
Alucard is not his name.
You must stop him before it is too late.
Stop him before death comes to Dark Oaks.
Tell me if he is coming tonight.
I see you... marrying a corpse, living in a grave.
I see...
[Flapping]
[Flapping,
Squeaking Continue]
Queen Zimba!
[Bird Cawing]
** [Waltz]
Uh, Steven!
This excitement over Kay's count has worn me out.
If you'll all excuse me,
I'll let Steven take me upstairs.
[All Murmur] Good night, Colonel.
Good night.
- He's holding up very well.
- Good night.
[Woman] Good night, Colonel.
Well, Father,
I'm afraid we'll have to do this all over again when Count Alucard does come.
I'm afraid so.
I hope you're not too tired, Father.
No, I feel fine.
Now, you run along and dance.
- Steven'll help me upstairs.
Good night, children. - Good night then.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Colonel.
Good night.
I'll smoke a cigar before going to bed.
- That'll be all for now, Steven.
- Yes, sir.
Kay, you're worried about something.
I wish you'd tell me what it is.
Wouldn't you be upset if you gave a reception... and your guest of honor didn't appear?
- Is that all?
- Isn't that enough?
Yes, I suppose it is, but I rather thought you might be worrying... about that old Hungarian gypsy you brought back with you.
I understand she died tonight.
- Queen Zimba?
- "Queen"?
That old swamp cat with a cabin full of dried lizards and stuffed toads?
It's good riddance, if you ask me.
How did you know she was dead?
That sort of news travels fast.
One of the farm hands told me.
He also said you were there when she died.
- I'd hoped no one knew that.
- Why?
She died of a heart attack.
Certainly your being there could have no bearing on it.
Oh, they'll ask questions...
What was I doing there, and what brought on the attack?
And if I told them, no one around here would believe it.
Oh, what do they know of these occult matters?
Blind fools.
Kay, I think it's about time
I talked to you frankly.
We're not blind, and we're not fools.
We're just plain, sensible people... that refuse to be fooled by a lot of supernatural nonsense.
- "Nonsense"?
- Exactly.
There's no magic in dried lizards and dead chickens.
Ever since you met this Count Alucard in Budapest, you've changed.
I hardly know you.
Kay, let me take you away from all this morbid business.
A six-month's honeymoon... a year, if you like.
We won't come back here until you've overcome some of these strange ideas.
- I'm sorry.
- "Sorry"?
Does that mean you're breaking our engagement?
Oh, no. You mustn't even think that.
Then what is it, Kay?
There must be some reason.
Of course there's a reason.
Since we were kids, there's never been anyone in my heart but you. You know that.
But, well...
Don't ever doubt me, Frank, no matter what happens.
Believe in me.
Believe that what I'm doing is best for us both.
Has it anything to do with Alucard?
[Sighs]
I see.
I'm afraid there's something
I must tell you, Kay.
Alucard is an impostor, a fake.
- How can you say such a thing?
- I wrote to Senator Manfield.
His reply informed me that Count Alucard is not known at the Hungarian embassy.
[Scoffs] You must be very proud of that bit of snooping.
I only did what any man would do to protect the girl he intends to marry.
[Guests Chattering]
Miss Kay!
**[Continues]
Dr. Brewster, is there anything I can do?
No, no. You stay here.
Keep the party moving.
Father!
Get some water!
Looks like the colonel fell asleep and dropped his cigar.
That's what started the fire.
Yeah, that's probably what happened.
There's no evidence of asphyxiation.
His heart might have stopped beating before the fire.
He might even have died in his sleep.
He looks as though he were literally frightened to death.
It's purely a reflex of the facial muscles.
Doctor, what are those two marks on the throat?
They don't look like burns.
[Sobbing]
Come, Claire.
I think you'd better go.
[Guests Chattering
Quietly]
[Car Engine Revs]
[Knocking]
Announce Count Alucard.
Explain that I came by motor and was delayed.
I'm sorry, sir, but
Colonel Caldwell died tonight, and the family isn't receiving.
- Announce me!
- Yes, sir.
Central,
I called Professor Lazlo at Muirfield...
University about a half an hour ago.
Will you please check the call for me?
This is Dr. Harry Brewster,
228. Thank you.
[Ringing]
Hello?
Yes, this is
Harry Brewster speaking.
[Chuckles]
Fine, thank you.
Why, I called to find out if you know anything about... a titled Hungarian family named Alucard...
A-L-U-C-A-R-D.
Alucard? No.
I'm sure there is no such family.
The name is not Hungarian.
Well, can you tell me, is it possible there's a Count Dracula still living?
Dracula?
I'm sure there is not.
History says the last Count Dracula died in the Middle Ages. Why do you ask?
A certain Count Alucard is visiting a friend of mine.
I happened to notice that the name spelled backward is Dracula.
[Chuckling]
It made me curious.
That is strange.
According to the legends of my people, the last Count Dracula became one of the undead... a vampire... and was finally destroyed in the 19th century.
[Chuckles] I am considered somewhat of an authority on the subject.
I know, Professor.
That's why I called you.
If this man is an impostor, why should he assume that name over all others?
Oh, he wouldn't... not if he were sane.
In Transylvania, the name is associated only with evil.
I advise you to be very careful of that man.
From your tone, I gather you don't entirely disbelieve the legends of the former Dracula.
In my research, I have uncovered data which I cannot entirely disprove.
I do not say I believe, but, in honesty,
I cannot say I disbelieve.
I repeat, be very, very careful of that man.
I will, Professor.
Thank you very much.
Good-bye, sir.
You will find this will a comparatively simple document, owing chiefly to the fact that you two girls are the only living kin of Colonel Caldwell.
It divides the entire estate... cash, securities and all... evenly between...
Pardon me, Judge Simmons.
May I ask the date of that will?
August 24. It was made on the occasion of Miss Claire's attaining legal age.
Then there's a will of a later date.
There's no important difference between them, Claire.
There's a mighty important difference for you, Kay.
According to this, you get nothing but the plantation.
Claire gets all cash and securities.
It's properly witnessed and can't be disputed, but I can't imagine what your father was thinking of.
It's the way I wanted it.
To divide the estate otherwise would have meant selling the plantation.
I love Dark Oaks, and hope to live here... always.
But, my dear child, it takes real capital to operate a plantation of this size.
I wouldn't worry about that, Judge.
I think Colonel Caldwell knew what he was doing.
Oh. Oh, I see.
Well, I'd, uh... I'd offer my congratulations, but this hardly seems the proper time.
That seems to end the matter.
I'll start the legal machinery in motion at once.
In fact, I'll start it today, if the clerk's office is still open.
Good-bye.
Oh, don't bother, Claire.
- I'll find my way out, thank you.
- Good-bye, Judge.
I can't understand how you've been able to get along without servants.
I take it that none of them have returned since that night.
No, but I'll arrange for others if I find I need them.
Well, of course, you know what you want to do.
Come along, Claire.
Let's leave these two alone for a while.
I'll see you again before I leave.
I'm so terribly sorry for Frank.
I'm afraid he's living in a fool's paradise.
A fool's paradise?
Yes, I'm certain Kay doesn't intend to marry him.
Well, what's the trouble...
- Count Alucard?
- Oh, she couldn't marry him.
There's something, well, repulsive about him.
The way he came in the night Father died, and...
Oh, I don't know.
I understand he left almost immediately.
At least that was decent of him.
Yes, but...
I'm positive Kay's been seeing him more or less secretly.
Why do you say that?
A couple of nights ago,
I heard them talking in the hall downstairs.
Somehow, I didn't like the idea, and I went to the head of the stairs to make sure.
- And?
- Kay was alone in the lower hall, but she was looking up at me as if... well, as if she'd been caught at something she wasn't very proud of.
I see.
Did you mention it to her?
Yes, but she pooh-poohed the idea, said I was dreaming.
I let it go at that, but I wasn't dreaming.
I hadn't been asleep.
Hmm.
That does sound strange.
Have you been in the guest house since the night your father died?
No, but surely you don't think Count Alucard...
I don't know what to think!
He couldn't be living in town without my knowing it.
I'd like to take a look at his belongings, if he hasn't taken them away.
He couldn't have done that alone... they were too heavy.
This might be a very good time.
Two large chests as well as the trunks came on the train.
I don't know what's become of them.
They were put in here.
That's strange.
They're not in there either.
Well, it may not be ethical, but there are reasons we ought to find out more about the count.
He didn't have any handbags.
I don't like it, Claire.
He can't be traveling around with only the clothes he's wearing.
See what I meant about Frank and Kay?
I don't like it, Claire.
I don't like it one bit!
You've got to leave here and go back to town, and the sooner the better.
You sound as if I was in some kind of danger.
I'd rather not go into that, but I insist upon your leaving.
You can go in with me and send for your things later.
Well, I can't leave Kay alone.
If I'm in danger, she must be too.
I'm going to make one last attempt to persuade her to leave.
If she won't...
Well, if she won't,
I want you to join me in swearing out... an insanity complaint against her.
An insanity complaint?
Are you serious?
Kay's my sister!
Claire, everybody's in danger here,
Kay more than anyone else.
If she won't leave voluntarily, we've just got to force her.
Yes, but-but she'd be arrested, put in an asylum!
I'd never do that to her.
Claire, don't you see?
We've got to protect Kay from herself.
Yes, what is it?
You remember me, don't you, Mr. Kirby?
Yes, of course. You're
Colonel Caldwell's daughter.
- Sorry to hear about your father.
- Thank you.
May we come in?
We want to be married. Married?
Yes, of course.
Come right in.
Ma! Cecilia!
In a few moments, my dear, you will become Countess Alucard.
[Wind Whistling Fiercely]
[Thunder Rumbling]
Everything has worked out as we planned.
This house is ours.
No one else has any claim on it.
I like old houses, and I like your countryside and the swampland.
- It's very different from your homeland.
- That is why I like it.
My land is dry and desolate.
The soil is red with the blood of a hundred races.
There is no life left there.
Here you have a young and vital race.
You've spoken of your people, but I want to know more... their legends, their mystery, their gifts.
Perhaps someday we may return there.
As I have told you, my dear, ours will be a different life, without material needs... a life that will last through eternity.
[Knocking]
[Sighs]
I'll see who it is.
[Knocking Continues]
I told you not to come here again, Frank.
I'm sorry.
Please, Kay.
I've got to talk to you.
Kay, I must know what this is all about.
I know that you and Alucard are meeting secretly.
I followed you tonight.
I don't know where you went because I lost you, but...
We went to Mr. Kirby's.
We were married.
Married? No.
No, you couldn't have!
I told you before, we were married tonight.
You'll save us all a lot of unpleasantness by going back to town with me tonight... and taking the first train out in the morning!
I'm afraid
I do not understand.
Then I'll make it clear.
You're going back to town with me tonight.
In the morning you'll take the first train out.
Kay will have the marriage annulled, and if you try to stop her... or show up in this part of the country again, you'll be jailed!
Kay!
[Squeaking]
[Labored Knocking]
Frank!
My boy!
Harry...
Harry, how did I get here?
Did you bring me here from Dark Oaks?
No, you came alone, about a couple of minutes ago.
What's happened, Frank?
Harry. Harry!
Harry, I've killed Kay!
It's all mixed up, but I know I shot her twice.
Harry, am I insane?
Could I have shot through Alucard and killed her without hurting him?
Tell me what happened.
Well, l... I shot right through him.
I shot right through him!
Kay screamed and fell, and he just stood there... just stood there, staring at me... just staring at me!
- You don't believe that, do you?
Nobody will. - Yes, I believe you.
- Have you got your revolver?
- I dropped it in the drive.
But you haven't told me just what happened.
Kay and Alucard were married.
- I know. I followed them.
- Well, didn't you try to stop the wedding?
A tree smashed my car, and I lost them.
Then I went back to Dark Oaks, and I found them there and got in a fight with him.
He got me by the throat.
It was like one of those crazy nightmares... where you can't move or struggle or...
I had no more strength against him than a baby.
He just threw me aside.
Then I fired.
The bullets went through him without even hurting him, and...
- and killed Kay.
- What did you do then?
I don't know!
I just seemed to be running and falling and...
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know anything except I found myself here.
I don't even know if it's real!
Maybe it's a nightmare or something!
Shh. Just rest yourself for a while, Frank.
We'll find out just how much of it happened.
Here. Drink this.
Lie down, Frank.
[Hinges Creaking]
[Clucking]
May I inquire... what you are doing here?
I was about to ask you the same question.
Tonight Miss Caldwell and I were married.
I am now master of this house.
You see, you owe me an explanation.
I came here to see Katherine.
The door was open, she didn't answer my call, and I thought I heard somebody here in the cellar.
I, too, thought that I heard someone in the cellar.
Come.
Dr. Brewster, what on earth brings you here this time of night?
I hope nothing's happened to Claire.
No. No, she was worried that something had happened to you.
I'm sorry.
Count Alucard and I were married tonight.
Yes, so the count told me.
It was the way we wanted it... quiet and alone.
That's the way we're going to live, Doctor.
You see, I'm engaged in some scientific research.
It will take up all of our daylight hours.
And we'll have no time for social life.
We want you to explain this to Claire.
And to Frank.
I'm fond of Frank, but, of course, he must never come here again.
I'd like you to tell all our friends not to come.
If Judge Simmons has papers for us to sign, tell him to bring them in the evening.
Katherine is going to assist me in my research.
I see.
Well, uh, there doesn't seem to be any more for me to say, so, if you'll pardon me,
Katherine, I'll be leaving.
Good night.
Good-bye, Doctor, and say good-bye to Frank.
Perhaps I should emphasize some of Katherine's wishes.
When I came to Dark Oaks,
I was not graciously welcomed.
Now the position has changed.
I am master.
Anyone who enters here without my permission... will be considered a trespasser.
Good morning, Sarah.
Will you set another place, please?
For Mr. Stanley... he slept on the couch in the office last night.
There's nobody in there now, sir.
There's a blanket on the couch but no sign of Mr. Frank.
Why didn't you put him in the spare bedroom?
No wonder he never stayed for breakfast.
I'll just take coffee this morning, Sarah.
[Knocking]
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, Judge.
It's Judge Simmons,
Doctor.
Give Sarah your hat and coat and have some breakfast with me.
I'll keep my coat on.
I can only stay a minute.
- Quite a rain we had.
- Yes, started about 4:00.
- Claire isn't here yet?
- No.
No, I expect her any minute though.
I was up most of the night studying that insanity complaint you got out against Katherine.
What did you decide?
Well, if I didn't know you,
I'd be suspicious of your motives.
You have no evidence of insanity, Harry.
The fact she wants to live alone at Dark Oaks may be eccentric, but that's all.
And her infatuation for this count, even if he's an impostor...
That may be bad judgment, but it couldn't be construed as insanity.
They were married last night by Kirby.
Oh.
[Phone Ringing]
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Katherine's like a niece to me.
You're wanted on the phone,
Judge Simmons.
It's Mrs. Simmons, sir.
She says it's important.
- You better take it in my office, Judge.
- Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Yes?
Yes, dear.
What?
Yes. Well, I'll go right over to the courthouse.
Good-bye.
Frank Stanley surrendered to the sheriff a while ago.
Told some story about killing Katherine.
That's not so, Judge.
I know.
He came here in a delirious condition and told me the same story.
I gave him a sedative and I drove out to Dark Oaks.
I talked to Katherine, and that was long after Frank said he killed her.
Oh, well, you'd better come to the courthouse and tell them that.
Sarah?
Professor Lazlo is arriving here from
Memphis on the morning train.
He's spending a few days here.
- Make him comfortable, will you?
- Yes, sir.
- Morning, Bob.
- Good morning.
[Man]
Come in.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Morning, Coroner.
- Morning.
Where's Frank, Sheriff?
The deputy's fetching him.
We're all going to Dark Oaks.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
Dr. Brewster says that Frank is insane.
I talked to Katherine and her husband after
Frank was supposed to have shot her.
What? Well, I'm going to Dark Oaks, anyway, and talk to them myself.
No need of going till evening.
Katherine and her husband will be away all day.
Where will they be?
I don't know, but they told me to tell Claire they wouldn't be home.
I'm gonna take Frank out anyway.
Maybe he'll come to his senses... if we make him go over the ground like in his confession.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
Frank has had a shock.
What he needs is complete relaxation.
Frank Stanley has confessed to murder.
I have to act on it.
It won't hurt him to ride out there.
- I give you my word that it will.
- That's too bad!
Money and position don't rate him any better treatment than anyone else from me.
- Did he act crazy to you, Dr. Peters?
- No, can't say that he did... a little irrational, maybe, same as anyone after committin' murder.
Hmm.
You can come along, Doc.
If everything's all right,
I'll forget all about the confession.
That ought to be all right.
Funny that they'd leave the door open.
Anyone here?
Tell us where you were when you shot Katherine, and where she and her husband were.
There's nothing to worry about.
Enact the scene just as you think it happened.
It was in the library.
I seem to remember running out there and dropping the gun in the driveway.
Are you sure you didn't drive off in your car?
No, I couldn't have.
I remember a tree fell on it earlier while
I was following Kay and Alucard.
- About what time was that?
- It's all so mixed up.
I just don't know, but I'm sure
I went out that way.
Come on, Frank.
Suppose you show us just where.
I was here, but I don't remember anything after that.
Remember this,
Frank?
I think we'd better go back to the office,
Doctor, while you do some explaining.
Kay! Kay, my darling!
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Has Professor Lazlo arrived?
Yes, sir.
He's been here all day, in and out.
Can I fix you something to eat?
The professor's had his dinner.
No, thanks.
Professor,
I'm glad to see you.
I heard about the tragic events of last night.
I called at the courthouse several times, but they wouldn't let me see you.
- Step inside.
- Thank you.
The sheriff believes I'm an accessory after the fact in the murder of Katherine.
- I can't say that I blame him.
- Why?
He can't believe that I spoke to
Katherine after Frank shot her.
Because I urged him to keep away from Dark Oaks until tonight, he thinks I intended to hide her body during the day.
- But he didn't arrest you?
- No.
No, me questioned me most of the day, but he's not ready to hold me.
Then, you didn't tell him what we believe?
[Chuckling] The chances of convincing a hardheaded sheriff... that we were dealing with a vampire seemed slim.
Very.
Yet I am satisfied that such is the case.
Alucard is undoubtedly a vampire... probably a descendant of Count Dracula.
Are you sure we're not allowing our imagination to run away with our common sense?
Can you suggest any other explanation for the events of the past few days?
No.
Neither can I give a lucid explanation of a vampire.
Broadly speaking, a vampire is an earthbound spirit... whose body comes to life at night and scours the countryside, satisfying a ravenous appetite for the blood of the living.
This it does by drawing it from the throat of its victim.
That's a nauseating thought!
They're supposed to be immortals, no doubt?
Practically.
So long as they return to their graves before sunrise.
Between then and sunset, they remain in a sort of, uh, cataleptic state, during which they can be destroyed by two different means.
At night, however, they are invulnerable.
You mean you believe Frank shot through Alucard without hurting him?
[Chuckling] Bullets would have had no effect on him.
It's strange to hear a man of science like yourself... calmly admit that he believes in a superstition so fantastic.
I could spend days citing proof that it is not mere superstition.
My own homeland in the Carpathian
Hills where Count Dracula lived... is sad testimony to its truth.
What was once a happy, productive region is today barren waste... villages depopulated, the land abandoned.
Maybe that's why he left there and came here to a younger country, stronger and more virile.
Of course... and he will fasten on it and drain it dry, just as he did his homeland.
Unless... we can find his grave and destroy him in it.
His grave? He was buried in Hungary, wasn't he?
Yes, but you will find that one of the chests he brought... contains a layer of soil from his birthplace.
That constitutes a grave.
Are you serious?
Rest assured he has it hidden in some safe place... and returns to it just before sunrise every morning.
Our job seems to be to find that chest with him in it and destroy him.
That won't be as simple as it sounds.
The vampire can assume very many different forms at will.
Sometimes it appears as a bat, sometimes as a werewolf... and sometimes as a small cloud of swirling vapor.
In this way it can move unseen among its enemies, learn their plans and be in a position to outwit them.
You are very brilliant, aren't you, Professor Lazlo?
Perhaps too brilliant for your own good... and that of Dr. Brewster.
You're right.
I am here because this is a young and virile race, not dry and decadent like ours.
They have what I want, what I need, what I must have.
Do you suppose that I would allow any mortal to stand in my way?
Here, drink this.
Thanks.
This doesn't leave me much room to go on disputing your theories.
How in the world did you drive him away?
I showed him this.
A simple cross!
It would take too long to explain why they fear it, but they do.
Keep this and wear it at all times, especially in your sleep.
Dracula has you marked for death.
Not only me, but unsuspecting people in this district... who'd never believe us if we tried to warn them.
We must find some way to destroy him before... [Knocking]
Excuse me, Doctor Harry, but it's Mrs. Land to see you.
Something's happened to Tommy, Doctor.
Put him here.
I sent him to my sister's on an errand.
He was gone so long,
I finally went after him.
- Will you get my bag?
- Certainly.
I found him lying beside the road.
He talked a little, but he didn't make sense.
He acted like he was scared foolish.
He said something about a foreign man in a fog, but there wasn't any fog tonight, Doctor.
I noticed those wounds on his neck too.
What are they... small animal bites?
No, I don't think so.
We can fix that very easily.
Sarah?
Yes, Doctor Harry?
Why don't you make Mrs. Land a cup of tea?
Go along with Sarah, Mrs. Land.
Yes, sir.
Tommy's going to be all right.
He's had a bit of a shock.
I want him to stay here until he regains consciousness.
I'll call you.
Thank you, Doctor.
Dracula's first victim.
It's starting fast.
Does that mean that Tommy's in danger of becoming a vampire?
No, unless Alucard drained so much blood from him that he died.
What about Kay?
She died from bullet wounds, and yet you implied that she would become a vampire.
Yes, but her case was different.
Her background was...
I know... morbid!
She'd gone overboard on the subject of the supernatural,
- black magic and the like.
- Exactly.
I rather believe that Miss Caldwell may have made the transition... from choice.
No one could choose a thing so loathsome!
Don't forget, the girl was morbid.
That means thanatophobia, fear of death.
And Alucard could promise her eternal life.
Eternal life at such a price?
Why do you think she is a vampire?
The dirt which I understand had been thrown into her grave... who else would have done that except Alucard... Dracula?
That means we have to destroy her as well?
That should be relatively simple.
Her sister could order her cremation while the body is still in the morgue.
Perhaps you're right.
[Phone Ringing]
Hello. Oh, hello, Claire.
I was just about to call you.
No, I think that'll be perfectly safe.
Professor Lazlo and I will stop and pick you up.
It's no trouble. Besides, there's something we want to talk to you about.
All right.
See you in a few minutes then.
The sheriff s office just called her.
They say that Frank is still a bit irrational and insists upon seeing her.
While she's there, she can leave orders for Katherine's cremation.
Oh, Sarah?
Mrs. Land?
Unfortunately,
I have to run along.
In a few minutes, it'll be safe to take Tommy home.
Don't you worry.
He's gonna be all right.
Thank you, Doctor.
[Kay]
Frank?
Frank.
Frank.
Kay.
No, it can't be.
Yes, Frank, it's Katherine.
No, you can't be Kay.
Kay's dead!
I know, I killed her.
I saw her fall.
I was with the sheriff when he found her body.
She was dead.
She was dead!
I saw her!
You see me now too.
- Yes, but...
- Do you doubt your own eyes?
It is you.
It is you, Kay, and you're alive!
But what is it, Kay?
You seem to be cold, like death.
You seem to be Kay, but there's a strange difference.
It's almost as if I didn't know you.
Does that mean you no longer love me?
I'll always love you.
Enough to spend the rest of your life with me? But...
But you're married to Alucard.
I don't love him.
I never did.
- But you're married to him!
- I had to.
It was part of the plan
I told you about in the garden.
I asked you to have faith in me then.
I beg you to have faith in me now.
I don't understand.
Count Alucard is immortal.
Through him,
I attained immortality.
Through me, you will do the same, and we will spend eternity together.
Are you serious?
Do you expect me to believe anything so unreal?
How can you explain the fact you shot through him without hurting him?
How else could I be here?
Why, I can't explain it.
It's... it's so incredible!
Perhaps you'll understand when I tell you...
Count Alucard's real name is Count Dracula.
Count Dracula?
You mean the Hungarian who's supposed to have become...
Don't use that word.
We don't like it.
Say, rather, that we are undead, immortal.
Do you mean you deliberately planned this?
You married him so you could become a...
So you and I could attain immortality, yes.
But even if it would work, do you expect me to agree to anything so fantastic?
You have no choice.
I've taken the first step while you were sleeping.
No.
No, I can't do it.
I've already told you, you have no choice.
Frank, isn't eternity together... better than a few years of ordinary life?
Yes.
Yes, I suppose it is.
There's one thing you must do while you're still in your present form.
- What is that?
- Destroy Dracula.
"Destroy Dracula"?
But how?
There is one advantage all humans have over us.
You can move about in the daytime.
We can't.
We must return to our graves before sunrise, or we're destroyed.
But how can I keep him from his grave?
You don't have to.
You can destroy him in one of two ways... either drive a stake through his heart, or burn his grave before he reaches it.
You must do this,
Frank, for us.
Miss Caldwell! It got so late,
I didn't think you were coming in.
I thought you might have told Frank, and I didn't want to disappoint him.
I don't suppose we're allowed to see him too?
Sheriff says no.
Find out if he knows where Count
Alucard keeps himself during the day.
I'll try.
[Door Unlocking]
[Jailer]
Third one on your left.
- Hello, Frank.
- Hello, Claire.
It's nice of you to come... after everything.
I can only stay a few minutes.
I just wanted to tell you that I know it was an accident.
That makes me feel better.
Kay understands too.
I'm... sure she does.
I know it, because she...
Would you think I was losing my mind if I told... you that Kay has been here to talk to me?
I'd be more likely to say you'd been dreaming.
Yes, I guess you're right.
I was dreaming.
You know, they'll never convict
Stanley of that killing.
- No?
- No-ho!
He's as nutty as a filbert.
He's been back there talking to some dame who wasn't there.
First he talks in his voice, then he answers in the woman's voice.
Did you hear anything that was said?
That'd be a swell way to spend a rainy evening... eavesdropping on some goof talking to himself in two voices.
Huh! Some fun!
Dr. Brewster's doing all he can for you, Frank.
All he can do is get me out of here on an insanity plea.
- That shouldn't be hard.
- You mustn't even think such things.
Why not? I can't be sane.
I really believe Kate came here to talk to me.
If that's not crazy...
When are they going to hold the funeral?
We haven't been able to contact Count Alucard so far.
Do you happen to know where he stays during the day?
Why during the day?
It's an unpleasant trip out there at night, and there's no phone.
Why should anyone think
I know?
You saw him meet Kay on the road once, and I wondered if you saw where he came from.
I'm sorry.
I don't know anything.
I suppose you'll be burying her at Dark Oaks.
Yes, I think so.
At least her ashes will be taken there.
- Her ashes?
- Yes.
I'm going to leave an order for her cremation.
You can't do that.
You can't do that, I tell you!
She isn't dead! I know!
She talked to me!
You can't cremate her!
It would kill her!
I won't let you burn her now that she's immortal!
You mustn't excite yourself.
Reconcile yourself to the fact that Kay is dead.
But she isn't!
- I know she isn't dead!
- Let her go!
But she isn't dead.
All right, Frank.
I think you'd better leave,
Miss Caldwell.
- You must listen to me.
- Frank, try and get some sleep.
Good night, Frank.
Kay?
Kay!
Did you hear what she said?
They're going to cremate you.
Yes, I heard.
That means Dr. Brewster has guessed the truth.
We may have to eliminate him and Claire.
No, not your own sister.
She's no longer my sister when she interferes with me.
But if they cremate you...
They won't find me.
I'll go to
Dark Oaks tonight.
But we'll never be safe as long as Dr. Brewster's alive.
Our first worry's Alucard.
If I could get out of here,
I'd start hunting for him.
I'll get you out, but you won't have to hunt for Alucard.
- I know where he can be found in the daytime. - Where?
Remember the drainage flume near the edge of the swamp?
- Yes.
- That's the place.
Be sure you don't get there until after the sun is up. [Door Squeaking]
Didn't I tell you to get some sleep?
I couldn't go to sleep.
I was talking to someone.
Yeah.
Well, she's gone now, so I'll just douse the lights.
I'll wait for you at Dark Oaks, in the playroom Claire and I used to have in the attic.
I'll unlock the cell and bring you a gun.
There is very little doubt in my mind... that Kay has visited
Frank in his cell, and I'm afraid for one very definite purpose.
What purpose?
Didn't you tell me that she and
Frank have always been in love?
Ever since they were children. Why?
Well, it's an unpleasant thought, but there are cases on record... where the living have voluntarily joined the ranks of the undead... in order to consummate what might be called... an unholy alliance.
You can't be serious!
Such a pact between
Kay and Frank is unthinkable!
Perhaps.
But so long as there is the remotest possibility... and I insist there is... we must arrange for immediate cremation.
Otherwise she will destroy her own soul and Frank's.
- Frank!
- Get back! Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!
Frank!
Frank Stanley!
- What happened?
- Frank Stanley just escaped!
- Look out, he's armed. - Get after him!
If you have to shoot, do it.
What happened, Mack?
How'd he get out?
I don't know, Sheriff.
The keys were on the desk as usual.
Now they're gone and so is Stanley.
I tried to stop him...
Ooh!
Did you have anything to do with this,
Dr. Brewster?
Certainly not!
We are as anxious as you to keep him locked up.
More so. Did you hear him do any more talking to that girl?
What girl?
Katherine Caldwell.
Katherine Cald...
It's some kind of a crazy trick Stanley pulls.
He pretends to be talking to some girl... first in his voice, then in hers.
Is this some trick so he'd sound crazy?
Did you listen in as we asked you to?
Yeah.
- But it was too crazy to bother about.
- For instance?
Well, the girl's voice said something about getting him out of jail.
[Lazlo] That wasn't so crazy, was it?
He's out.
That's right.
I never thought of that.
Do you think there was someone in there with him?
Never mind that.
What else did he say, however crazy it was?
She said something about meeting him at Dark Oaks in some kid playroom.
I know where. What else?
Oh, some crazy stuff about killing Count Alucard.
Did he say kill him or destroy him?
Come to think of it,
I believe he did say
"destroy," shove a stake through him or something.
- Shove a stake through him?
- Yeah.
- We're dealing with a madman.
- Obviously.
Did he say anything that would give us an idea... where he expected to find Alucard?
Yeah, but that really was crazy.
She said something about a swamp with a drainage tunnel...
I know where that is too.
We'll get right out and warn Alucard before Frank gets there.
You'll not warn him if we have to lock you up in jail.
What's that?
There's a lot you don't understand.
If you doubt it, let's take a look in that morgue.
- What's the morgue got to do with it?
- Never mind.
- It's becoming as plain as day.
- It has been to me for some time.
Then let's go take a look in that morgue.
Okay.
- The coffin is gone, corpse and all!
- Of course.
- You sound as if you expected it.
- We did.
What's your part in this?
How do you know in advance what's happening?
We'd better get to where Alucard is hiding.
We'll explain it on the way.
I thought you weren't going to warn Alucard.
We're not.
But we may have to save Frank from the count and from his own madness.
Gentlemen, the farther we go, the crazier you sound.
Well! It is seldom that my enemies are so accommodating.
How did you learn where to find me?
I know all about you.
You're not Count Alucard but Count Dracula, one of the undead... a loathsome thing, surviving on the blood of the living.
There'll be no more blood of the living for you, because I'm going to destroy you!
If you had learned more about me, you wouldn't have come here until after sunrise.
Now it is not I that is going to be destroyed.
Put it out!
Put it out, do you hear me?
Put it out!
Put it out!
Put it out!
You stay here,
Jack.
This is one thing we didn't foresee, Doctor.
How could we?
I don't get it.
What's happened?
To maintain his existence among the undead,
Dracula had to be back in his coffin before sunrise.
Frank prevented it, as you can see.
You mean, that's all that's left of Alucard?
Look at the ring on his hand.
It bears the Alucard seal, just as on his luggage.
Assuming it is Alucard or Dracula or whoever, where is Frank Stanley?
He's still wanted for murder.
Do you still think Frank killed Kay deliberately?
Look, Doctor, I'm only the sheriff.
I'm not the judge.
It's my job to bring him in and the court to decide he's guilty.
Of course, but I think our testimony will have bearing on their decision.
Undoubtedly.
But the main thing to do now is to find Frank, and I think I know where he is.
[Fire Crackling]
A terrific terrif... best job of lettering I ever saw in my life!
This boy ain't see much.
That'll be $10 please.
Yes sir, you're a real artist with that stuff, a real artist.
10 fish.
- Er, i'll mail you a cheque tomorrow pal. - I'd rather have it money today.
You're never going to get any place if you don't trust people.
You know i've been around a long time buddy...
You don't belong here, you really belong on Broadway.
Yeah, and I think the walk'd do you good.
I take it off for 5 bucks.
- Pretty huh? - No but you might do, are you available?
- For you anytime miss...?
- Lawrence, Kathy Lawrence.
Kathy you're my first client...
Shall we celebrate by me carrying across the threshold?
It's such a nice day I think i'll walk.
- You take the comfortable chair.
- Thank you.
- I think you'll do fine.
- You're a doll to say so but...
Just what do I do fine?
I'm a reporter on the
San Francisco tribune...
I'm down here on a story and I need some help.
I'm your man, I shadow, investigate, prove and disprove suspicions... and dance divinely, all at reasonable rates.
- I can't pay you a fee.
- This changes the picture.
But i'll make you a business proposition...
Shoot.
- I presume you know this person?
- Sure, Judge Finlay Drake.
Or ex-judge since every cop in the state started looking for him.
I think I know where he's hiding.
You realise there's a $10,000 reward riding on Judge Drake's head?
How would you like to have half of it?
What's your angle?
I've a pretty strong hunch the Judge is hiding in a local private sanitarium.
The La Siesta for mental cases.
Owned by a Dr Clifford Porter... former state medical officer and good friend of Drake's.
Are you good at hunches like this?
Well actually this is more than a hunch.
That's Madge Bennett, the Judge's girlfriend.
- What can I say?
- That picture's 10 years old.
Everybody thought Madge left
San Francisco with the Judge... but I saw her in town a few days ago and followed her down here.
Last night she went to the sanitarium.
Why don't you give this information to your paper or to the police?
Well because I can't prove he's there until somebody actually sees him.
And where do I fit in?
I want you to go in as a patient.
- You want me to say i'm crazy?
- It's the only way you can get in there.
Honey, i'm not that hungry.
You stand to make a lot of money and put the judge and his friends in jail.
No, don't go away mad but... i'm not getting myself locked up in any nuthouse on a hunch.
I see.
Now that our business is over... how about you and me doing a tour of the local pool rooms.
So sorry, pool isn't my game.
You're not my man.
I'll find someone else.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I come bearing news and apologies. - Alright, come in.
I decided to check on your girlfriend just out of curiosity.
Oh really?
She went back to that sanitarium again last night... and she didn't go in through the front entrance.
I knew you'd check up on her, that's why I left the picture in your office.
Well what d'ya know?!
Say, I bet that's why you left that scrap of Hotel Coronet stationery... so i'd know where to find you too.
I suppose that makes you a clever detective figuring that out.
I've...
I've come to accept your proposition, what's our first move?
We'll need a close relative to ask for your commitment.
I'm sure my relative's will be delighted... if I had any.
- Are you married?
- No.
Would you mind being married to... me?
Twist my arm.
The point is we'll just way we're married to get you into the sanitarium.
Well ok if we can make a deal for after i'm out.
This is strcitly a business proposition...
You're part in this deal is to play a mentally unbalanced husband.
Who's always kissing his wife in public and private, all the time.
We can figure out a better act than that.
Oh no, I think we'd both be awfully good in our parts.
Mr Stewart, i'd love to spend the rest of the day... trying to outmanoeuvre you but we have work to do.
- What's this?
- Research...
You have to decide what kind of a mental case you're going to be.
Paranoid, schizophrenic or manic depressive... and then we'll have to decide on your name.
What's wrong with the name i've got, Ross Stewart?
I think it's kind of pretty.
Well it's a beautiful name but with your retiring personality... there's just a chance that somebody in town might know you.
So I think we'd better change it to something simple like Harry or...
Horton, I like names that go together, Harry Horton.
Alright Mr Horton, and you can be an unemployed salesman.
You hit the nail right on the head with that unemployed.
Now, tell me Mrs H, what's supposed to be the matter with me?
Well that's what we've got to figure out...
I thought i'd take you downtown to the state psychiatrist... tell him you've been acting queerly and ask his advice.
And you'll have to know how to act so he can recognise the symptoms.
Well know here's one I kinda like...
The symptoms of the manic depressive consist mainly of... emotional disturbances, depression, anxiety, elation, rage, a variety of happy and sad moods.
You think you can be sad for a minute?
Oh I can be very sad,
I can even be unattractive.
You can tell him I beat you one minute and kiss you madly the next.
I'm not so sure you're not really insane with that kissing fixation of yours.
Maybe you got a better way to go crazy?
Is there something troubling you Mr Horton?
Something you're afraid to tell your wife about?
Is there something troubling you Mr Horton?
I got nothing to say, it was her idea to come here, not mine.
We want to help you but you must cooperate.
Nobody can help me, nobody can help me.
I don't know what to do for him doctor, he's getting worse all the time.
Just what would you like me to do Mrs Horton?
I don't know, I...
I wanted your advice.
Could you bring your husband back here Wednesday, at 10 o'clock?
- I suppose so, why? - I'll examine him and make a report to the court...
If the court concurs they'll recommend that he be confined to the state asylum for treatment. - Oh no!
- No what?
- I...
I wouldn't want him in the state asylum...
I thought possibly a private sanitarium.
Private sanitariums are an expensive proposition... but if you think you can afford it by all means place him in one.
Most of them are very good.
How would I go about it doctor?
Is there anyway you could help me?
Certainly, i'll write a letter stating that, in my opinion, your husband needs professional attention.
A letter from me will, more or less, force them to admit him immediately.
Private sanitariums are very crowded today.
Ms Cook, will you come in please,
I want to dictate a letter.
I'm sure in time your husband will respond to treatment Mrs Horton.
How much time Dr Porter?
How long do you think he'll have to stay here?
That's impossible to say.
You must be prepared to leave him in our care as long as necessary.
I hope he'll be allowed to move around and be with the others.
He'll live quite a normal life.
Our patients are allowed to... mingle freely and routine everyday relationships.
About the cost doctor,
I can't afford a private room.
We have a bed open in a 3-man ward, i'll assign him there.
That'll be fine.
Hopps.
I want you to be good dear, do everything they tell you.
This is Mr Hopps, one of our attendants.
- Mrs Horton.
- Mrs Horton.
- And her husband.
- Mr Horton.
Mr Horton's going to be with us a while Hopps, fix him up in ward 10.
Yes sir.
Will you come with me.
So you think you've got a beef with the world?
Well, here we are.
Here's your bed.
You hang your clothes in your locker every night.
I have to take your tie and everything you've got in your pockets.
You can keep the cigarettes.
What about matches, how do I get a light?
You can only smoke in the day room, we don't like patients to have matches.
- Give me your suspenders.
- How do I keep my pants up?
Sorry, we have to take all these things away from depressives.
We don't want any "accidents".
Mr Purvis, Mr Horton.
Another poor face caught in the Porter net.
Don't unpack your bag Horton, get out of this vile hole while you still able.
Why do you want to make trouble for yourself Mr Purvis?
I keep telling you your going to get into trouble if you don't keep still.
He looks strong, put him to work with you Hopps.
Yes sir.
Horton, ask the noble doctor if the patient helpers get paid for their work.
It's part of the treatment to keep you occupied with some useful tasks.
Treatment! Making the patients work saves hiring janitors.
Mr Purvis i've warned you before...
If this keeps on it may be necessary to transfer you to the locked ward.
Well i'll have to take your shoes too, i'll bring you some slippers.
- Whose bed is that?
- Mr Quisk's.
He's a very nervous fellow, likes to be left alone so don't bother him.
He ought to be left alone?
What about our nerves?
Wait till you try to sleep tonight.
Wait till you try to sleep.
Why don't you take it easy.
Why don't you have backbone enough to do something about this place Hopps?
You're going to make trouble for yourself.
You know what a rotten disgrace it is...
Why don't you tell somebody on the outside?
People on the outside aren't much interested in us on the inside.
Inmates or attendants.
Hopps, what's wrong with the new guy?
He's a depressive, he'll be alright after a little rest.
I'll make sure he gets a good rest.
Hiya champ.
Larson, stop that!
I was just giving the champ a workout.
I've told a dozen times not to abuse the patients.
- Shut up you screaming monkey.
- Cut it out, quit hitting him.
Get back in bed, you too
Purvis or you'll get the same.
What kind of a joint is this?
Look new boy, let me give you some advice... don't stick you nose in what's none of your business.
Now get back in bed.
And stay there.
- Who is he?
- Larson.
He's the one you've gotta watch around here.
You came here to be cured, you're more likely to be killed.
You can come here anytime you're not supposed to be working.
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.
Good day sir, I wonder if by chance you're a chess player?
- No, i'm afraid i'm not.
- Oh that is unfortunate.
- Please pardon the intrusion.
- Ok.
Poor Topper's been trying for 3 years to get someone to play chess with him.
3 years?
He's been here that long?
- What's wrong with him?
- He's a firebug.
Nearly burned up a whole neighbourhood once.
Otherwise he's ok.
Used to be a pretty big businessman they say.
How long the rest of these men been here?
Oh, 3 months to a year or more.
You won't be here that long, I don't think there's much wrong with you.
I... I met another attendant last night.
- Larson? - Just stay away from him all you can.
Mind your own business around here and you get along better.
That's all i've heard so far, what kind of a joint is this?
I gotta get back to work.
- Where do you think you're going? - Just looking around.
- What's up there?
- The locked ward.
That's where you'll wind up if you don't behave yourself.
Go on back where you belong.
Go on back where you belong.
- What kept you so long?
- I had to stop at one of the wards.
Frankly judge i'm beginning to resent... you sending for me all hours of the day and night.
After all i'm doing you the favour.
You'd still be a smalltime quack if I hadn't given you a break.
I'm more than repaying that break right now.
I'm risking everything keeping you here.
It's a short risk.
My boys'll be here as soon as things cool off.
Suppose these men of yours are picked up by the police and talk?
Men working for me can't afford to talk.
I hope you're right.
- Mighty fine cigar.
- Don't be so appreciative.
With the money i'm paying you to stay here... you can afford a truckload of those cigars.
- Well, here's to good luck.
- To both of us.
You don't have to be so physical.
You forget, I don't know what i'm doing.
Don't move the hand.
Really this is just a business deal.
And what a deal!
All this and 5 grand too.
- Any luck? - So far
I haven't seen any...
So far I haven't seen anyone who could possibly be Judge Drake.
- There was a rumour that he was seen in Florida. - Florida?!
You mean maybe i'm in here just for laughs?
No, the police say it was just a phoney.
Anyway Madge Bennett came here again Thursday night.
She had a briefcase with her.
Obviously she's his outside contact.
I've got to spot her and find out where she goes.
You know if Drake's in disguise he may be kinda tough to recognise.
I know, I thought of that so I brought you a present.
I didn't know you cared.
I thought if you kept looking at it you could see through any disguise.
Now you're a real smart girl.
- Good afternoon Mrs Horton.
- Oh good afternoon doctor.
- May I see what you have in your hand please. - No.
Oh let doctor Porter see it dear, he'll give it back to you.
- Very nice picture Mrs Horton.
- Thank you doctor.
That was quite a performance, your talents are amazing.
Thanks.
Do you think you've seen all of the inmates?
I covered the place pretty well, all except the locked ward.
They haven't let me in there so far.
When can you have a look in there?
Give me time, you know they don't exactly have conducted tours around here.
I know.
Anything I can bring you the next time I come?
A couple of steaks.
Oh you don't look as though you're suffering too much.
Come to think of it neither do you.
And you're not double-crossing me on the outside are you?
- Running around with other men?
- That is none of your business.
- I'm your husband.
- Only in here.
I'm kinda getting used to the part.
You're not just gonna run out on me when this is all over are you?
We'll talk about that when it is all over.
You'll be a rich woman, $5,000.
I've been looking a long time for a rich woman.
I've been looking a long time for a rich man.
Oh money isn't every....
Oh wait a minute, that's me!
- I'll be worth 5 grand myself.
- I know.
Hi.
You look only half worked to death.
- How do you like that little rest room now? - Don't like it's overtime.
Purvis?
What's the locked ward?
That's supposedly for the violent patients.
Anybody up there now?
A couple of violents, they're kept there all the time.
"Under restraint" they call it.
It's too much trouble to try and cure them with any kind of treatment.
Have you heard of the isolation room they've got there too?
Bare room, padded walls, they throw you a blanket, you sleep on the floor.
Oh yes, this is a very high-class sanitarium.
Fine care and treatment you get here.
You pay extra well to be treated like a dog!
Try and complain about it, try and protest about anything... and what do you get, i'll tell you what you get, an extra special treatment...
- They throw you in a locked...
- You better keep your mouth shut.
Easy boy, wake up, wake up.
Are you alright?
Now take it easy, quiet.
- What happened?
- Larson told me he got in a fight.
Yeah, a fight with Larson.
- He didn't do this. - Who then?
Larson dragged him out of here.
Just forget about it, just mind your own business and you won't get into trouble.
You're a decent guy Hopps, why do you let things like this happen?
- There's nothing I can do about it. - You can quit.
You know this is bad, why do you stand for all this?
Wait a minute Hopps...
What are you so scared of?
You ask too many questions.
- What are you doing here? - Waiting for my wife, she's coming today.
This is night, go on back to your bed.
I gotta see my wife,
I might miss her.
Go on back to your room.
- Feeling any better?
- A little.
Today is visitors day, anybody coming to see you?
Think they're going to let anybody see me like this?
You ought to demand your release from here, go someplace else.
I have a hundred times.
What about your wife, can't she get you out?
They've got her convinced i'm dangerous.
She believes them?
They tell her it's better to keep me here than to go through a... legal court commitment that'll publicise the fact her husband's... crazy.
You just relax, it'll take me a little time but i'll get you out of here.
Chin up.
- What happened?
- Larson hit him.
- Why? - He tore up some paper in the day room.
Somebody ought to tell this kid's family this is no place for him.
He doesn't have any family.
You'd better get along, your wife's waiting for you.
Hi.
Well, you're beginning to act like a husband.
I thought I was kinda tough but this joint's really beginning to needle me.
I know it must be a grim place but just stick it out a little while longer.
I'll stick it out, don't worry.
I saw Madge Bennett come in last night, she went up to the locked ward...
I tried to follow her but one of the attendants caught me.
What happened?
Nothing, I gave him some silly talk and got sent back to my room.
You've got to be careful.
Don't tell me you're really beginning to worry about me.
Of course I am.
I've been watching Madge's rooming house...
So far there's no sign that she's getting ready for a trip.
Good, all I need here is a few more days.
I'm really getting close to home baby.
I hope so, i'm getting nervous.
You've got to get well soon dear so I can take you home.
That's the nut that caught me the other night.
I think maybe we're getting in too deep,
I don't think it's worth the risk.
You're not forgetting that $5,000 are you... and a story that's gonna make you famous?
I don't care very much about the money or the story anymore...
I just don't want you to take any unnecessary chances.
Don't worry baby, I wanna be around to collect.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- You got any matches?
- Yes.
Baby, the next time you show up here... i'll know for sure whether
Judge Drake is on the premises.
Hopps.
Why isn't Topper cleaning up the locked ward?
- Oh I needed some help... - I'm the one that need help, send him upstairs.
Mr Topper...
- I think you'd better go upstairs.
- Yes, thank you very much.
- Oh Mr Topper.
- Yes.
- I think you dropped these.
- Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
Hopps, I smell something burning.
Get the fire extinguisher.
- How did the fire get started?
- I don't know.
You'd better get out of here.
You get out too.
- Are you alright? Did you burn yourself? - No no, i'm ok.
Well come on, we have some more work to do.
You got drunk and fell asleep with a lit cigar, that's what happened.
You think i'm going to stand by and let you ruin me and my place?
I tell you I wasn't smoking when I went to bed.
How could you remember, you drank a quart of whiskey.
That's my business, you're being well paid for the little damage...
I'm not being paid nearly enough to end up in jail.
I'm made a deal with you judge for one month, you've been here 5 weeks now.
If you're not out of here by another week i'll have to have more money.
You're going to start bleeding me, hey Porter?
I'm running a great risk in... furnishing you with the safest possible hideout you could have.
I'm entitled to additional recompense.
I'm not at all certain i'm as safe here as you seem to think.
What are you talking about?
- Who is that patient?
- What patient?
- The one who helped put out the fire. - Horton.
He seemed very much interested in me, he's new here isn't he?
Yes, his wife had him committed with a letter from the state psychiatrist.
I couldn't turn him down.
I don't like the way he looked at me.
You know I caught Horton on the stairs there the other night.
- What night? - Last Thursday, the night
I brought Miss Bennett up to see you.
And come to think of it it happened once before too.
Look here Porter, if you've let someone get...
Look through Horton's stuff in his room, he'll be at lunch.
I'll be in my office.
Didn't find much... just the usual stuff.
Nothing here will tell us anything.
Horton's record seems farily authentic...
Travelling salesmen, unemployed, married four years.
He's married to a good looking dame.
How could we have been so stupid?
This Horton, he's either a cop or a newspaper man.
If the police are watching the sanitarium we're all finished.
You'll never be able to get out of here without being caught.
Calm down, we've got to figure this thing out.
What is there to figure out?
He know's you're here, it's only a question of time now.
You're a stupid man when you get excited Porter.
Horton didn't know for sure I was here until the fire a little while ago.
He hasn't been able to communicate that information to anyone yet.
His wife'll be here to see him this afternoon.
Obviously she can't be allowed to see him...
She's a part of this scheme of Horton's.
She's the one we've got to worry about now.
I was crazy ever to let you come here.
I'll lose my place, go to jail.
You won't lose a thing, all you have to do is get rid of Horton.
I'll get out of here tonight with Madge... and there's no way for anyone to prove I was ever in here.
- How do we get rid of Horton? - That shouldn't be too hard to figure out.
- Champ could take care of him.
- That's not a bad idea.
You could make out a report that... he was attacked by one of the violent patients and died of the effects.
That's murder.
I didn't bargain for murder when I went into this with you.
You have a choice between that or jail and ruin.
It'll have to wait until tonight when all the visitors are off the premises.
You better have Horton locked up.
You'll have to give his wife a story why she can't see him today.
Maybe we'd better lock her up too.
Don't be ridiculous, that would really tip our mitt.
- Just stall her.
- I'll handle it.
Get those things back to Horton's locker.
We don't want him to know yet that we've found him out.
- What's wrong, lose something?
- Yeah.
We found one of the patients with these, Porter says they're yours.
Yeah.
You gotta keep your stuff locked up around here.
I can see that.
I'm gonna need you for a few minutes Horton.
It's Saturday, i've gotta change my clothes, my wife's coming.
You have an hour yet, i've gotta get the locked ward cleaned up.
Come on.
Before you start washing these walls
I want you to clean up this room.
I'll need some help if i'm to be done in time for...
You have plenty of time, stop your crabbing... you're not gonna miss anything.
- Mrs Horton?
- Yes.
Dr Porter would like to see you please.
Please.
Mrs Horton, doctor.
- Good afternoon doctor.
- Hello Mrs Horton.
Won't you sit down.
- Is something wrong doctor?
- I have some most regrettable news.
Your husband has had an accident...
He was apparently wandering around the building last night... and somehow got into the locked ward with the violent patients.
- What happened? - He was attacked and pretty badly beaten.
Believe me Mrs Horton, we are extremely sorry this has happened.
I can't understand how he got into the locked ward without being seen.
- May I see him doctor?
- That wouldn't be advisable my dear...
He's suffering from shock and shouldn't be disturbed at all.
Just to look in on him.
To be quite frank Mrs Horton he's been rather badly hurt.
As soon as his condition warrants i'll call you and you can see him.
Alright.
- You'll let me know tomorrow how he is?
- I'll call you myself in the morning.
Let me say again that I am extremely sorry that this has happened however...
I'm sure that he'll come around alright.
Thank you.
Say Larson.
Horton hasn't been in here all day, he's not in his room and I thought...
He's alright, never mind about him.
Yeah but...
When are you gonna learn to stop messing up this place?
Don't you ever hit him, i'll take care of what he does.
You bet you will.
I'm getting sick and tired of this kid of yours messing up the place every day.
I don't know why Porter lets you both stay here.
From now on i'm gonna hold you responsible for anything he does.
Don't you ever lay a hand on my boy again.
Yeah, what can you do about it?
You're no good Larson.
You'll get yours someday.
You'll get yours.
Larson, come with me.
Mrs Horton's been very nicely taken care of.
I told her that her husband was attacked by another patient last night and... his condition was too critical for her to see him today.
- Are you sure she believed you?
- Positive, she seemed quite stunned.
You know...
I'd like to find out who or what
Horton is before you take care of him.
Let's get him in here, after all we're not keeping any secrets from him now.
- I won't need that.
- I don't want any ruckus raised.
I wonder how Horton knew you were here.
Do you think he found out about Madge and followed her?
I don't think so, Madge is a pretty clever girl.
However, I don't see how that could do him any good now.
I must say you're being mighty calm about it.
- I think we're in hot water upto our necks. - Upto whose necks?
Sit down Horton.
Or whatever your name is.
Alright, who are you?
- I don't get you.
- You will.
Larson.
Let's not waste time, we know you're not really here as a patient.
Who are you? Who sent you here?
I'm Harry Horton, my wife sent me.
I'd advise you to tell us what we want to know... otherwise things may become very unpleasant for you.
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Nor that picture of mine on the back of your wife's photo.
I told your wife this afternoon that... you'd been very badly beaten by a violent patient.
Ain't she gonna be set when she finds out you died from your injuries.
- Keep your stupid mouth shut.
- Who are you? Who's in this with you?
The entire police force Porter.
- I think he's lying.
- You'll find out any minute.
My wife must've reported my supposed accident by now.
Apparently she didn't.
She left here over 2 hours ago and we haven't heard anymore about it.
You will Porter, you will.
And if you boys are smart... you won't make it any tougher for yourselves than you need to.
Accidents are quite likely to happen at a mental santiarium my friend.
This is absolutely the most fantastic story i've ever heard.
- It's incredible.
- I suppose it is.
You made a fool out of me, involved me in a situation that is most unethical.
And now you want me to help you?
We felt that Porter might be suspicious unless... we came to him with some professional opinion.
You thought nothing of degrading my professional reputation.
- I'm sorry doctor but if Judge
Drake... - If he's in there.
Has Horton or Stewart or whatever his name is... actually found
Judge Drake in there?
I don't know.
You're accusing this doctor
Porter of a criminal act.
You have no proof.
- Stewart may actually have been attacked by a patient. - I don't think so.
I think both of you have acted stupidly and rashly.
Well alright doctor but that isn't the point now.
If you won't help me i'd better go to the police.
I don't think the police would... barge in on a private sanitarium merely on your suspicions.
They'd let themselves wide open for a civil suit.
I think you're needlessly worried about him.
I'd advise you to go up there tomorrow or the next day...
Take him out of the sanitarium and forget the whole thing.
Tomorrow may be too late.
Well frankly Mrs I don't know what I can do for you.
You'll have to excuse me, it's after
6 and I have a dinner engagement.
Come on Horton.
Are you guys kidding?!
Now wait a minute Champ.
- Leave him in there.
- He ain't going any place.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing sir I...
- I have some work to do.
- Get out of here and stay out.
Yes sir.
Lock that door.
I've got a gun at your head, do as your told.
Alright alright, what do you want?
Pull over to the kerb when you get past the main gate...
Stop the car and throw the keys in the back seat.
Operator, get me the sheriff's office.
If you don't struggle too much the ropes won't hurt you.
We got trouble, we found a guy in here as a patient looking for the judge.
The judge is getting packed.
We've got everything fixed so nobody gets in a jam.
Ms Bennett, judge.
You're late Madge.
Did Larson tell you what happened?
Put your hands down, get
Harry Horton in here right away.
- I don't know what you're talking about. - Get him.
- Larson.
- Yes sir.
Bring Horton in here.
- Dr Porter said to leave...
- Bring him in here!
Easy Champ.
Easy boy.
Horton, Horton.
Easy Champ.
Hurry up!
Hold it!
Mrs Horton, you're a wife in a million, gimme that gun.
- Can you make it alright?
- I can make it baby.
Alright Larson, open that door... wide!
Get going judge.
Larson, unlock that one.
Stay where you are judge.
No Champ, no.
No Champ!
No Champ, no!
No, no!
Alright Porter, drop the gun.
It's ok honey, come on.
Alright butt, drop it.
I'm Ross Stewart, private detective...
I imagine you know my friend Judge Finlay Drake.
I certainly do. Over by the wall judge with your hands in the air.
Looks like you had quite a party.
We did indeed and we couldn't be happier that you boys were invited but who...
- I called them. - You, Hopps?
You're a man of action, I never thought you had it in you.
Neither did I!
I'd better call my paper.
He's a nice guy, hang onto him.
Operator, long distance please.
Operator, long distance please.
I'm sorry darling, my job, I never like to start anything I can't finish.
Neither do I!
Long distance, long distance, operator.
Mr Horton... oh excuse me.
I never did think he was crazy!
Lawrence Stewart Talbot, who died at the youthful age of 31.
R.I.P.
That's it.
Give me the chisel.
Suppose they didn't bury him with the money on him.
Everybody in the village knows about it... his gold watch and ring and money in his pockets.
It's a sin to bury good money when it could help people.
This gives me the creeps.
What do you think it will look like after so many years?
Just bones and an empty skull.
Watch the lamp.
Get me the light.
Wolfbane.
Wolfbane?
Yes.
Even a man who is pure at heart... and says his prayers by night... may become a wolf... when the wolfbane blooms... and the moon is full and bright.
It looks like he's asleep.
Let's get on with it.
First the ring.
We won't have to worry for a long time. I thought the dead was stiff.
Shut up.
Gold.
It's holding me.
Help me.
Help me.
Alive.
Help, help!
Don't leave me!
Here, now.
Come up.
Come on. Wake up and get along with you.
You've got a home, haven't you?
Or do you want me to take you to the station?
Good heavens!
How is the patient, Nurse?
He's conscious, Dr. Mannering.
And talked. He insists upon sitting up.
Conscious? Talked?
But that's impossible so soon after a critical operation.
The nurse tells me you're well enough to talk.
Why, yes.
Pulse, 72, no fever.
There's no pain?
No.
Where am I?
Queen's Hospital.
Queens? Yes, Queen's
Hospital in Cardiff.
Wh...
How did I get here?
You were found in the street more dead than alive with a head injury.
How did you get that skull fracture?
I... don't remember.
This is Inspector Owen.
I'm Dr. Mannering.
What's your name?
Lawrence Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot.
Where did you come from?
Llanwelly Village.
But... how did I get to Cardiff?
That's enough for now.
You must rest.
You'll be fit again very soon.
If there's any change, call me immediately.
Yes, Doctor.
Hello? Put me through to the police station at Llanwelly.
Just a routine checkup, Doctor.
Then we can close the case.
Llanwelly Police Station.
This is Inspector Owen speaking, from Cardiff.
Have you got anything in your file on a man named...
Lawrence Talbot?
Why, of course.
He lived here.
Good. That's all right, then. We've got him up here in our hospital.
Huh. I wouldn't want him in our hospital.
He died four years ago.
Why, of course I'm sure,
Inspector.
I was present at his funeral.
That'll be all,
Inspector. Good-bye.
Lawrence Talbot died four years ago. Your man's an impostor.
That's a harsh word, Inspector.
Poor devil of unsound mind.
I'll wager he's sound enough to remember his own name.
I'm gonna have another talk with him.
Inspector.
Yeah?
That man is my patient, not your prisoner.
I'll decide when he can be questioned again.
Very well.
It's in your hands.
I found this bandage here when I came in this morning.
I didn't open the window.
The patient must've done it himself.
You'd better cover him up.
You're all right.
Nothing has happened.
Better get some more bandages.
We'll renew the compress.
Now, don't excite yourself.
Please be calm.
Doctor... something terrible has happened.
You must've had a nightmare. It's evident you were walking in your sleep.
Call the police.
The police? Yes, you'd better call them.
I'm a...
I'm a murderer.
Yes, of course.
Anything you say.
Ask Inspector Owen to come here at once. Yes, Doctor.
What is all this about wanting the police?
Last night, I...
I killed someone.
But you were in this room all night.
I tell you, I did it.
I killed someone.
But you couldn't have.
You must've heard the nurses discussing it.
Mr. Talbot, you're suffering from a delusion.
It's true someone was killed last night, but it happened many streets from here.
Moreover, he was attacked by some sort of wild animal.
That's just it.
I turn into an animal.
Well, Mr. Talbot.
Decided to remember your real name?
Mr. Talbot seems to have heard about the unfortunate constable last night.
It's disturbing him. But he doesn't understand.
There's a curse upon me.
I change into a wolf.
It's a bit difficult to believe, my good man.
See that scar?
That's where I was bitten by a wolf.
Only it wasn't a real wolf.
It was a man.
A werewolf.
I killed him.
Now I change into a wolf at night when the moon is full.
Hmph.
It's the truth.
Ask Maleva, the old
Gypsy woman. She knows.
Maleva? Gypsy?
Hmph.
Mr. Talbot, you must get back into bed.
Oh, are you blind? Won't you believe me? Help me.
Just tell us your real name.
Let us do the worrying.
I told you.
Lawrence Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot!
Why can't you understand?
Lawrence Talbot died four years ago.
Died?
Four years?
Well, I did...
Ohh.
I can't die.
Mr. Talbot, if you want us to help you, you must do as we say.
Now, please lie down.
You think I'm insane.
You think I don't know what I'm talking about.
Well, you just look inside that grave where
Lawrence Talbot is supposed to be buried, and see if you find a body in it.
Please get back into bed. Get on with it.
You're treating me like a lunatic.
Well, you're as stupid as all the rest.
Come along, Inspector.
You mean to say that Talbot actually experienced that murder last night?
I'm afraid so.
People with brain injuries sometimes develop supernormal mental powers... that are quite extraordinary.
Certainly he got up and opened the window.
The borderline between delusion and reality is very narrow.
Sometimes a patient may unknowingly overstep that line.
Then that man's dangerous.
He ought to be behind bars.
He's a lycanthrope.
A what?
Lycanthrope.
Oh.
What's that?
A man who imagines himself to be a wolf.
Oh.
Poor devil.
We should try to do something to help him.
Well, Doctor, I think I'll run up to Llanwelly and find out...
You know, Inspector,
I had the very same idea.
To be able to cure this man,
I have to know who he is.
Right.
We'll go up together.
Somebody's broken into this vault.
How long since you were here last, Sergeant?
Not for months. Nobody's died in Llanwelly lately, and nobody comes here if he doesn't have to.
Hmm.
The door...
What about it?
It's broken from inside.
Here, give me that.
Someone must've taken the body out of the tomb.
That's not Lawrence Talbot. Not Talbot?
Do you know who this is here? Yes. That's FreddyJolly.
Who's he?
Been up for vagrancy.
Hmm.
What would you say he died of, Doctor?
Severed jugular.
This man bled to death.
Same as the constable in Cardiff.
Looks rather like the bite of an animal. Aye, that animal.
We remember it well hereabouts.
And it must've carried away the corpse of poor Sir Lawrence.
What animal? Why, didn't you know, sir?
There was a wild animal around here a few years ago.
It killed people. Bit through their throats, drained their blood.
Did they kill it? SirJohn
Talbot thought he did, sir.
He attacked it in the dark one night, or so he thought.
But it was his son he killed. Poor Mr. Larry.
Where is
SirJohn Talbot now?
Over there, sir. Died of grief shortly after.
Let's get out of here.
But the body, sir.
Mustn't touch that.
That's evidence. Yes, sir.
Sergeant, if it's convenient, I'd like to see a photograph of Lawrence Talbot.
There's one up in my office, sir. Good.
Here's Mr. Larry's photograph, sir.
Take a look at this face, Doctor.
Isn't that our man in Cardiff?
Yes. There is a similarity. But I wouldn't swear it's the same man.
Of course it's not the same man.
If it were,
I'd be off me top.
I think the sergeant here better come back to Cardiff with us... and see if he can positively identify this man.
That's the thing to do. Do you mind if I use your telephone?
I'd like to check up on my patient's condition. Of course, Doctor. Over there.
Hello? Put me through to the
Queen's Hospital in Cardiff, please.
I want to talk to
Dr. Gordon.
Have you ever heard of a Gypsy woman named Maleva?
A Gypsy woman?
A vagrant, eh?
Mm-hmm. We always register them.
Hello, Dr. Gordon?
This is Dr. Mannering speaking.
How's Lawrence Talbot doing?
You know, the head-injury case that went violent yesterday.
Did you notify the police?
Well, I suppose that's all we can do at present.
I'll be back tonight, Doctor.
Good-bye.
What happened to Talbot?
Did he die?
No, he tore off his straightjacket during the night and escaped.
Tore off his straightjacket?
How?
Bit right through it.
Tore it to shreds with his teeth.
With his teeth?
Bruno!
Stop it!
What do you want here?
I'm looking for an old Gypsy woman.
Maleva is her name.
Is she here with you?
Maleva? Yeah, she is with us.
You'll find her over there.
Maleva!
They told me you'd left England.
I've looked all over Europe for you, from town to town.
Now that I've found you, you must help me.
Come in.
What do you want from me?
Maleva, here I still carry the sign of the pentagram.
The mark of the werewolf.
I kill people.
When the moon is full,
I turn into a wolf.
It's not in my power to help you.
You're the only one that understands.
Nobody else in the world will believe me.
But you... you know.
Your own son Bela was a werewolf.
He attacked me. He changed me into a werewolf.
He's the one that put this curse on me.
You watched over him until he was permitted to die.
Well, now I want to die too.
Won't you show me the way? I can't.
But I will guard you and take care of you... as I took care of my own son.
You're not leaving us.
You're not going with him.
He has the sign of the beast on him.
He is dangerous only when the moon is full.
I shall watch over him.
He will murder you.
No. I shall take him to a place I know.
Where?
I know a man... who has the power to help you.
Help me?
Who?
Is that the town?
Yes, that is Vasaria.
At last.
Stop.
Ooh.
Let's ask in here.
Are you the proprietor? I am.
What do you beggars want?
Wejust want to ask you, sir,
about the Doctor Frankenstein.
Frankenstein? Don't mention that name around this town.
Oh, please, won't you tell us where he lives?
There.
That's his burial place.
The fire destroyed him and all his misdeeds.
He's dead?
Oh, but he can't be.
He didn't die any too soon for us.
We all wish that he'd never been born.
What did you want with him?
I heard he was a great doctor... who could help people that other doctors couldn't cure.
Him? Murder and crimes was all he ever brought us.
He harbored a monster in his house,
a thing created by black magic.
Dr. Frankenstein, dead.
Come.
Thank you, sir, for the information.
Come on.
Get out and stay out.
We don't want your kind around here.
Oh, keep your hands off of me!
Now I must go on living.
There's no hope for me to die.
Wait! Stop!
Don't go!
Wait!
Don't go!
Don't!
Who could've done this terrible thing?
Could it be the monster again?
Frankenstein's monster?
No. The monster was burned to death by Dr. Frankenstein.
Yes, we found his bones and buried them.
How do you know they were the monster's bones?
She wasn't killed by a monster.
An animal bit her to death.
I saw the wound on her throat.
What animals are around here that can kill people?
A wolf.
Yes, a wolf.
That's his cry. Come on. Let's get him.
Come on!
Come on!
There he is!
Where is he?
He was here a moment ago.
The Gypsy woman! What are you doing here?
Come on.
Speak up, old witch.
Where's that strange man that was with you?
Let's take her back to town.
We'll make her speak.
Dr. Frankenstein must've kept records.
A diary.
You know where it is.
Show me.
It isn't here.
"To my dear father".
Then... she's the one... that can tell me.
And this man, he wishes to buy the ruins of my father's estate?
Yes. That's why I asked you to come here, Baroness.
He wanted me to give him your address.
Naturally,
I refused.
But since I knew you were anxious to get rid of the property, and all the memories connected with it,
I thought that in my position as mayor...
I would take the liberty of sending for you.
- Did he say his name is Taylor?
- Yes.
And that's all
I know about him.
Baroness Frankenstein,
Mr. Taylor.
- Baroness.
- Mr. Taylor.
Come in, Mr. Taylor.
Come in, come in.
Do you mind if I speak to the baroness alone, please?
Why, uh... Why, uh, certainly, certainly.
Now, uh, if, uh...
If you need a witness for the contract, Baroness, I'm at your service.
Thank you.
Won't you please sit down, Mr. Taylor?
Thank you.
I understand that you want to buy our land.
No, I...
I wanted to meet you.
I don't understand. I didn't know how to find you, and the mayor wouldn't give me your address, so I felt that if I offered to buy your land... that you'd be sure to come.
It's certainly a most unusual way to make an acquaintance.
But now that you have gone to all this trouble to meet me, what can I really do for you?
I want your father's records.
His experiments with life and death.
The records of the creation of the monster.
My father's diary.
Yes. You must give it to me.
I don't have any records.
If I had, I...
I would have destroyed them long ago.
My father was a great scientist, but all he created brought unhappiness, terror.
Oh, but you don't understand.
I must have them.
Won't you help me?
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor.
There is nothing I can do.
The house burned down, and I have never set a foot on that ground again... and never shall.
And that's all the information I can give you.
Well, is everything settled, Baroness?
No.
We decided not to go through with the sale after all.
Why, that sounds like...
Yes, Baroness.
It's the Festival of New Wine.
It begins tonight.
It's beautiful.
Takes me back to my childhood.
Why don't you join us tonight,
Baroness, as our guest of honor?
You would take the first train in the morning.
Thank you, Mayor.
Of course I'll stay.
You, too, Mr. Taylor. I hope you will accept the invitation... to be our guest tonight, on behalf of our community.
Thank you.
I'll be there.
Eternally! I don't want to live eternally!
Stay away!
Go away, all of you!
Let me alone.!
Stay away!
Good evening,
Mr. Talbot.
I beg your pardon.
You must be mistaken. My name is Taylor. I know you by Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot. You carry your identification on your forehead.
Baroness Frankenstein,
Dr. Mannering.
How do you do,
Dr. Mannering?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
How does it happen that you're here, Doctor?
I've been looking for you, Mr. Talbot.
And you were very easy to find.
The newspapers told me where to look for you.
Fontainbleu, Aachen,
Elrad, and finally Vasaria.
I simply followed the trail and found you.
Very clever of you, wasn't it, Doctor?
Mr. Talbot is returning to England with me.
I don't think that I care to do that, Doctor.
Baroness, will you give me the honor of the next dance?
Of course.
At our Festival of New Wine, gentlemen, it's a man's privilege to ask any lady for a dance.
And vice-versa.
Excuse us.
Why have you followed me?
Talbot, you're a murderer.
Prove it. You're insane at times, and you know it.
You're sane enough now, though, to know what you're doing.
Why don't you let me take care of you?
Do you think it would do any good to put me in a lunatic asylum?
You know that's where you belong. It's the only thing to do.
That wouldn't do any good. I'd only escape again, sooner or later.
We might be able to cure you. Might prevent you...
I only want to die.
That's why I'm here.
If I ever find peace,
I'll find it here.
You understand.
Why don't you help me?
Sit down.
How can I help you?
Dr. Frankenstein left a diary.
In it are his records of the secrets of life and death.
If I can find
Dr. Frankenstein's diary,
I can break this curse and find peace in death.
That's morbid.
Besides,
Dr. Frankenstein's experiments were considered rather extraordinary.
Medical science never, never recognized them.
That's just it. Why don't you ask that girl, his daughter?
She can tell you about things Dr. Frankenstein did... that your medical science has never heard of.
Talbot, I'm appealing to your better nature... while you can still think normally.
The moon will be full again soon. You must come back with me while there's still time.
Isn't there somebody that could understand?
Gentlemen, why those serious faces?
The monster.! The monster.!
The monster.!
No. No, it's me.
Come on with me.
Well?
Not a sign of them. We shall have to wait until morning.
It's clear to me they're hiding in those ruins.
Much as I'd like to kill the monster, I'd hate to crawl around... through the dark catacombs of Frankenstein's castle in the black of the night.
What about that Frankenstein girl? She has lived up there.
Let's bring her in here.
Stop, stop.
There's no need for us all to storm after her.
She'll come in if I ask her.
Why should we treat her so fancy? She's a Frankenstein.
Wait, wait, wait.
She's a young woman who's done us no harm.
Now, stay here.
Uh, the men would like to talk to you, Baroness.
The Gypsy woman is still locked up in the prison.
Let's find out what she knows about all of this.
There's the daughter of the accursed Frankenstein.
That name has brought nothing but misery and misfortune to our village.
We want an end of it, do you hear? Tonight.
Now listen to me.
The baroness and I want nothing but to help you.
I tell you, he's lying.
I heard him this evening...
talking to that stranger about insanity and murder.
I heard it with my own ears. Don't get excited. You won't get anywhere by raving.
Dr. Mannering is right. To find and destroy the monster, we must have a plan.
We know that it's hiding in the Frankenstein ruins.
I can lead you there, if you want me to.
I know those cellars well.
Don't trust her! Don't let them fool you! They're all in this together!
Here she is.
And the Gypsy too.
She's one of your gang of murderers. You know these people?
Speak up, old witch.
I never saw them before.
What's your name?
Maleva.
Maleva?
See? He knows her. Why don't you arrest them, all of them?
Lock up these murderers. As long as
I'm mayor, justice shall be preserved.
I shall decide what is to be done in this village.
Haven't we tried before to get rid of the monster by force?
We burned down the sanitarium, and yet we didn't destroy
Frankenstein's fiendish creation.
We must be more clever this time.
Let's use our brains for once.
Whose brains? Yours? I'd rather depend on my fists.
There's no use in storming the ruins.
We must pretend to be friends with the monster.
Yes. Why not elect it mayor of Vasaria?
This monster was created artificially.
It must be destroyed by the same means.
I'll take you to the ruins now.
I'll go with you, of course.
I promise you, if you'll help me, I'll rid Vasaria of this curse once and for all.
Talbot!
Talbot!
Talbot, where are you?
Talbot, we're your friends.
They must be there.
I saw the smoke.
- What do you want?
- We have come to help you.
What do you mean?
You wanted to find my father's diary.
Yes, of course. I'll show you where it is hidden.
She speaks the truth, my son.
L... I guess
I'll have to trust you.
Steady.
They're friends.
This is Dr. Mannering.
He's come to help you, to make you well.
Yes, that's why I'm here.
Dr. Mannering.
But the diary... You said you knew where your father hid it.
Yes.
It isn't in there.
I know.
Please.
The Secret of Life and Death.
"Matter ages because it loses energy.
"This artificial body
I have created...
"has been charged with superhuman power...
"so that its span of life will be extended.
"Its lifetime will equal the lives of more than a hundred human beings.
"This, my creation, can never perish, unless...
"unless its energies are drained off artificially... by changing the poles from plus to minus".
But that's the secret of life.
What good does it do me?
I'm not interested in life.
I wasn't created artificially.
I'm a human being. I've got real blood in my veins.
What can we do to end my life?
"Energy which cannot be destroyed can be transmitted".
Well, if that's the case, then the energies from my body can be drained off also.
Dr. Frankenstein must've... performed his experiments in this room.
With these machines.
The don't seem to have been destroyed by the fire.
You must fix them...
and help me be rid of this thing that keeps me alive eternally.
When you were talking to the monster,
I was afraid you meant what you said.
What did I say?
You said you'd help him.
Of course I can't.
I mustn't.
It shouldn't be difficult to connect these wires again.
Yes, I'll need these machines.
I believe they can be repaired again.
Machines, day after day.!
What does Mannering need machines for?
Remember Dr. Frankenstein?
He ordered machines too.
I tell you, that English doctor's no better than Frankenstein himself.
Ho, hum. Always grumbling,
Vazek. Always complaining.
We've got to trust the doctor. What else can we do?
But doesn't it strike you as strange that
Mannering and that Frankenstein girl... never tell us what they're doing up there?
If it wasn't for that old Gypsy witch... driving her wagon down to buy their provisions, we'd never see any of them.
I think we ought to go up there and see for ourselves. Right.
Oh, they're not hurting us. It's none of our affair what goes on there.
Do you want to wait for disaster to strike at us again?
I'll tell you what we ought to do.
Here are the ruins.
In here are all of them.
Here runs the underground stream that drives the turbines that Frankenstein installed.
But the water comes from up here... to the dam below.
Blow up that dam and they'll all drown like rats.
All of them.
You're drunk, Vazek.
That's why I don't take your word seriously.
Otherwise, I'd have you arrested for conspiring to endanger... the lives of this community.
That's the water.
The water rushing down to turn the turbines.
That'll make the machines work.
Doctor.!
Aren't you almost ready?
I'm setting the machines now. Everything will be ready for you in a little while.
Yes, but there's so little time.
I don't want to live through another spell.
Yes, I know. But please don't bother me now. I have work to do.
Remember, Doctor.
It must be tonight.
Why don't you lock him up... so you can give your full attention to do what you promised... to destroy the danger of the monster?
Please, Elsa, I know what I have to do.
But he's insane!
Insane?
He's not insane.
He simply wants to die.
Frank! Frank!
Listen to me, Frank.
I saw my father become obsessed by his power.
He died a horrible death, just as my grandfather did.
Yes, I know.
You promised the people to rid
Vasaria of this monstrous creation.
I want to be sure that nothing, nothing whatsoever, can sway you.
It is in your hands to undo the crimes my father and grandfather committed.
We must clear the name of Frankenstein.
All right. Tonight, I will draw off the monster's energy.
And I hope I'll bring peace to both of them.
"Connecting the plus poles to the minus...
"will charge the energy output of the nervous system... as by connecting the minus to the minus".
Connect the minus to the minus.
I can't do it.
I can't destroy
Frankenstein's creation.
I've got to see it at its full power.
Frank! You're making him strong again!
Frank, stop it!
Stop the machine, Frank!
Don't pull that switch!
Where's Vazek? He said he'd blow up the dam.
They call them
"the haunted shores"... these stretches of Devonshire and Cornwall and Ireland... which rear up against the westward ocean.
Mists gather here, and sea fog, and eerie stories.
That's not because there are more ghosts here than in other places, mind you.
It's just that people who live hereabouts are strangely aware of them.
You see, day and night, year in, year out... they listen to the pound and stir of the waves.
There's life and death in that restless sound... and eternity too.
If you listen to it long enough, all your senses are sharpened.
You come by strange instincts.
You get to recognize a peculiar cold... which is the first warning.
A cold which is no mere matter of degrees Fahrenheit... but a draining of warmth from the vital centers of the living.
Local people tell me they would have felt it... even outside that locked door.
We didn't.
They can't understand why we didn't know what it meant... when our dog wouldn't go up those stairs.
Animals see the blasted things, it appears.
Well, my sister Pamela and I knew nothing about such matters... not then, we didn't.
We had the disadvantage of being Londoners... just down for a fortnight's rest.
That tenth day of May 1937 was the end of our holiday.
We seem to be in somebody's garden.
What was somebody's garden.
What a marvelous old house!
We'd better get out before we're had up for trespassing.
- Where on earth did we leave the car?
- That direction, I think.
Look, a squirrel.
- Grab Bobby!
- Too late. Bobby, come back here!
- You bad dog!
- Bobby!
He's got the poor little squirrel trapped. He'll kill it.
My dear, sweet sister, it's more likely he's having his way with our Bobby.
Fine way to spend a holiday... chasing a dog!
- Where is he?
- Under here, I think.
I thought you had him.
He had me. There he goes!
Hang on to Bobby!
I can't!
Oh, well played, sir!
- Do you suppose he can get out?
- Certainly. He's on the roof by now.
That's a smart dog.
He'll be back any minute.
Rick, have you noticed anything?
Only that I'm in no shape to join the hunting set.
No, I mean this house. It's the loveliest thing I ever saw.
- Look at that staircase.
- Oh, boy, what banisters for sliding!
- Oh, Rick.
- What is it?
Your saying that, and the house... it took me back.
- Yeah, it's quite a bit like the...
- The rose bowl there... the grandfather clock there... and Mother in her best gray moire sweeping down the stairs.
- You'll be howling in a minute. Come out.
- Not on your life.
I'm going to see the rest of this.
Come on. Let's pretend we're buying it.
I'll toss you for the bedroom with the best view.
They've all got best views.
How lovely! Why does it make me feel I'm on a boat?
It's the light on the ceiling. That's the sea. It's nice to wake up and see that.
Oh, how I do hate living in a London flat.
If you're brought up in an old house, you always hanker for one.
It's stuck. You try it.
It's locked. Family skeletons, probably.
Oh, what a bore.
Rick, the bathroom!
An open fire while you bathe.
What luxury!
You know, this is a
Saturday-night-only bathroom.
You boiled yourself as red as a lobster, then hurried to bed to avoid a chill.
- Rick.
- What?
I've had one of my feelings.
We're really going to buy this house.
Oh, yes? Did your feeling tell you what we're going to buy it with?
If we both put in everything we have, maybe we can get it.
It's terribly out of the way, and it hasn't been lived in for years.
But what would we do with it? We can't drive nearly 300 miles just for weekends.
We'll live here all the time, and you'll work at your music.
My poor lunatic sister,
I happen to have a job.
Yes, and what a job... going to concerts... and telling your readers how bad the music was.
It's not good enough,
Rick. Chuck it.
Down here you'd write your own music, as you always should have done... and as you've always wanted to.
Rick, it isn't as if you were even a good music critic.
Well, thank you very much.
Anyway, I get paid hard cash.
Well, doesn't the idea attract you at all?
Attract me?
Look, you come out of here.
You're dangerous.
Don't you know how rare houses like this are?
- I like the banisters.
- How Lizzie'd love that kitchen.
That little beach must belong to it.
It's in good condition too.
Not a sign of damp.
- We'll get our furniture out of storage
- Be calm, Pamela.
A change like this would have to be discussed for months.
Nonsense. Important decisions have to be made quickly.
Well, my paper has asked me to do a series...
"Lives of the great musicians."
Reading time: two minutes.
- There you are. That'll feed us.
- Yes, until I run out of musicians.
Anyway, how do we know the place is for sale?
Rick, life isn't as cruel as that. It's got to be.
Now remember, Pam, no signs of keenness.
We're just mildly interested. Mildly.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
We'd like to see Commander
Beech, if we may.
- He's not in at the moment.
- Could we wait for him?
Won't you come in?
There's a fire in the study.
I think I can catch my grandfather by telephone.
- Who shall I say wants to see him?
- He wouldn't know our name.
It's Fitzgerald. My sister, Pamela
Fitzgerald, and I'm Roderick Fitzgerald.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I'm Stella Meredith.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Oh, not in that chair!
It's got a lumpy seat.
- Do you mind?
- Oh, no.
- Oh, dear. Will this do?
- Thank you.
We're an awfully un-smoking house.
Grandfather had a cigar blown straight down his throat once when he was on the foredeck.
He lost his taste for tobacco.
Can I help in any way?
We wanted to talk to the commander about a house he owns... on top of the cliff.
- Windward?
- Yes.
You see, we've fallen head over heels in love with...
- I mean, it might just do for us.
- Really?
We understand from Mrs. Brown at the inn ifs for sale.
Mrs. Brown is mistaken. Sorry you've been put to the trouble of coming here.
Perhaps if we could speak to your grandfather about it...
It wouldn't be the slightest use.
I'm sorry, but there's really no point in your waiting.
Stella, are you there?
Yes, Grandfather.
In here.
Well, what is it?
Some people who came here by mistake, Grandfather.
They're just leaving.
We heard that Windward
House is for sale.
Yes, it is.
Won't you sit down?
I'll be with you in a moment.
Thank you very much.
Grandfather, please.
I thought I made myself quite clear on this point, Stella.
- Yes, Grandfather...
- I don't understand you.
A house you haven't lived in since you were a child... a piece of property we can't afford to maintain.
But it was my mother's house. It's...
- I can't put it into words. It's...
- Nonsense.
Grandfather, please!
I don't believe many repairs will be necessary.
The roof is sound... and the walls have withstood the
Atlantic gales for two centuries.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
There was a considerable sum spent on the house some 20 years ago...
- when I gave it to my daughter.
- I understand. Well, I'm sorry... but I'm afraid £1,200 is our absolute limit.
- Is that a definite offer?
- Yes.
And you would pay the entire sum immediately?
- You mean you'd sell for that?
- Yes.
I suppose you ought to have the property surveyed before we...
- Oh, Rick.
- There's no need to get suspicious.
The house is worth far more than that... but I have a very young granddaughter... and £1,200 in the bank for her would ease my mind considerably.
We understand perfectly.
And you'd not be nervous in such a lonely house?
No, indeed.
Or of the wind at nights?
It plays odd tricks in old houses.
Are you trying to tell us the house is haunted?
No, Miss Fitzgerald.
No house is haunted.
But I had some tenants five years ago who complained of... disturbances.
What was the trouble? Ladies carrying their heads under their arms?
I declined to discuss it and canceled the lease.
- But I couldn't cancel a sale.
- We wouldn't want you to.
One does feel that a story like that should bring the price down.
I've already made a very considerable reduction, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Perhaps we both need time to think the matter over.
- But our offer's definite. Isn't it, Rick?
- Oh, yes.
Very well, then. I accept it.
Title deeds and checks will be exchanged by our solicitors.
In the meantime, I have your word, and you have mine.
Well, it's wonderfully simple to buy a house, isn't it?
- Pam, where are you?
- Here I am. Look, our own roses.
Rick, it's all ours.
Isn't it wonderful?
You know, it's bigger than I thought.
I can't wait to see what's in that Bluebeard room.
Probably the housemaid's cupboard.
Slops, mops, dripping taps.
I wonder how soon we can get cleaners and painters in.
You'll go back to London, of course, while I stay here.
Rolled up in a blanket like a squaw?
At the inn, idiot, until you ship me the furniture.
Did the old boy tell you why it was locked?
Never thought to ask him.
Well, now we know.
- It's the one ugly room in the house.
- Oh, it's not so bad.
That window, it's like a cucumber frame.
They put that in later to make a painter's studio.
Even the view doesn't cheer it up.
- What'll we do with it?
- My workroom, of course.
It's ideal. Put the piano over there with shelves for music... plenty of space to walk up and down, manuscripts all over the floor... hot pincers to tear the flesh from people who keep telling me luncheon is ready... stacks of checks from my publishers, and...
- Do you think this room is damp?
- It needs airing.
It's funny it should strike so cold in here after such a warm day.
- Oh, law.
- What, Rick?
I suddenly felt completely flattened.
Do you suppose I'll ever be able to write any music here or anywhere?
What on earth are you talking about?
You don't suppose we've made the most howling mistake, do you?
Rick, have we?
Why did the commander suddenly come down in his price like that?
The disturbances. Rumors like that are dynamite if you're selling a place.
Yes. Pamela, you're not going to get scared of this ghost business, are you?
Of course not, Rick. I don't believe in them, really... and I'd be interested, not scared, wouldn't you?
Me? No, disturbances wouldn't disturb me, not for a single second.
- It's Bobby!
- Of course it's Bobby.
Now don't go getting imaginative.
It is rather a filthy room, isn't it?
We're here, Bobby.
He's trying to tell us about the squirrel, I expect.
- Didn't he keep his date with you?
- Why don't you come up, stupid?
Rick, look at that lamb of a window!
Never thought Bobby was a killer at heart.
Who's that standing out there?
Looks like the old boy's granddaughter.
Don't waste a wave on that one.
Because she didn't want us to buy the house?
- I think she'd been crying.
- Had she?
Don't you see?
She adored the house, and we've cast her out.
- Isn't it awful?
- Stop making up stories.
She didn't live here.
She just doesn't want us to.
She's an ill-mannered little dog in the manger.
All right, Bobby. We'll take you back to the inn... and let you order your dinner.
Have you forgotten something?
No. On second thought, my landing gear isn't what it used to be.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.
- Twenty Turrets, please.
- Yes, sir.
- Isn't this Windward House?
- Yes, sir. Fine house too.
Glad to hear there'll be folk in it again.
- You have a dozen of these?
- Likely I have.
Oh, maybe you're the new owner.
Yes, my sister and I bought the place yesterday.
Well, well. I hope you'll bring it back to itself again.
The last lot that lived there weren't no good.
Went away owing money.
Got out of their lease starting ugly stories about the place.
- So that's how the rumors started.
- That's what I do say.
Here you are, sir. Nine seems to be all I have.
- That's all right.
- Of course, there are others say different.
- There are?
- Well, that's only natural... after the way the lady of
Windward House died...
- God rest her soul.
- You mean the commander's daughter?
Only child. Come near breaking the old gentleman's heart.
- He's never been the same since.
- How did she die?
- Fell off the cliff.
- Accident?
That's what I do say.
Good morning, Mr. Hardy.
- A copy of Amateur Gardening, please.
- Yes, Mrs. Coatesworthy.
Well, the best of luck to you, sir.
If you have a favorite tobacco,
I'll be glad to stock it.
Thank you. Good-bye.
The gent that just bought Windward House.
You don't say.
- Mr. Fitzgerald?
- Yes?
- Oh, it's you.
- May I speak to you for a moment?
Look here, young lady... if you want to talk me out of
Windward House, save your breath.
It isn't that. It's about me, yesterday afternoon.
My behavior was inexcusable.
- Come now. It wasn't as bad as all that.
- Thank you very much.
Your grandfather made you apologize, didn't he?
Oh, no. It was my mother.
Your moth...
But I understood that...
I beg your pardon?
I kept looking at her last night, thinking how I'd let her down.
- But isn't your mother dead?
- Yes, but I know all about her.
From Grandfather, of course.
I was only three when she died.
But I thought you said you looked at her.
Her portrait hangs in my room.
My father painted it.
- Oh, then it was his studio.
- Yes, and she was so beautiful.
Let's go for a walk.
Grandfather will never get over her death.
- He's hated Windward ever since.
- That's understandable.
But it isn't fair to hate a house because someone's died there.
I love Windward because she lived there for three years... and those were my years.
And that's why you don't want anyone else to live in it?
- That's foolish, isn't it?
- No, just one thing is foolish:
You're living somebody else's life.
- How old are you, Stella Meredith?
- Twenty.
You're 20, and you're pretty.
You shouldn't be wasting a single second looking back on three little years.
- You should be having fun.
- I am.
Oh, nonsense! What are you doing today, for instance?
- Oh, just things.
- Facts, details.
Oh, dear. I've got to match some wool.
Then I have to stop at the library and get a copy of Bleak House.
Grandfather and I are reading Dickens.
You're not going to do any of those things. I have a much better idea.
Isn't this better than reading to Grandfather?
- Oh, it's wonderful.
- Ever get seasick?
Fortunately, I have a stomach like Gibraltar.
Not externally, of course.
- Are you asleep?
- No.
Just wondering if our national confidence in Gibraltar isn't misplaced.
Shouldn't you get out of the sun?
No, I'd...
I'd rather... remain here.
Oh, please! The tiller... please!
- Smells good.
- That's mimosa. It was my mo...
Oh, I forgot. I'm not supposed to talk about that.
- Why?
- Out of the past.
- Oh, go ahead.
- It was my mother's favorite perfume.
My father sent me a bottle before he died.
I've made it last a long time.
Mimosa. Ever see it growing?
- No, I haven't.
- Like a million little yellow bells.
Like... Like sleigh bells.
It's smooth again.
Are you feeling better?
Oh, yes. I was about to resume command.
Bring her about sharply.
Head straight for the jetty.
Avast the boom.
Scuttle the funnels.
Lady, please!
I thought you'd gone off for London, Mr. Fitzgerald.
- Just leaving now, Ben.
- That'd be half a crown.
- You doing up your hair again?
- Yes.
No, no, no! Come on.
It's wonderful like this, all loose and free and windblown.
What am I doing? Talking high poetry or selling hairstyle advertising?
- You laugh at everything, don't you?
- Too much?
No. It's just I've never known anyone who laughed much.
See a lot of Pamela while
I'm away, will you?
- How long will you be gone?
- About three weeks.
Perhaps she'll let me help her with the curtains and things.
Get her to talk about me.
In a respectful way, of course.
None of those anecdotes where
I'm the family half-wit.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- I'll take you home first.
- You're so late starring.
Might as well.
I'd rather break it gently to Grandfather about our sail, if you don't mind.
All right. Gently but firmly, mind.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
- Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald...
- Yes?
I almost forgot to say it.
I'm awfully happy you and your sister are going to live at Windward.
Why, thank you, Stella Meredith!
Well, here we are.
What a grand house, Master Rick.
'Tis a mansion, so 'tis.
Are you worthy of it, Lizzie Flynn?
That's what I keep asking myself.
'Tis on top of the world.
- Rick!
- Hello, Pam.
- Baby darling!
- Lizzie!
Oh, you devil for being late.
I wanted you to see everything while it was still daylight.
Ah, Master Rick and his friends and their cocktails.
- Got Lizzie drunk.
- Get on with you, Master Rick.
- Oh, Bobby!
- Where's our Bobby?
- Don't, Rick.
- Something happen to him?
Nothing tragic. He just wandered away.
I suppose I haven't enough dog appeal.
- No, seriously, Pam.
- He loathed the country.
You know, no nice dustbins and no sporting interest in finding a tree.
Never heard of a terrier walking out.
Ah, Miss Pamela, I'm dreaming on me feet.
Pam, it's perfect. You're practically straight.
There's some soup in the kitchen.
Look at Whiskey now.
He knows where the food is.
- How did the furniture fit in?
- Beautifully.
I saw the grandfather clock.
It waved both hands at me.
If the soup's burned,
Lizzie will spank me.
Get along with you, miss.
The saints be praised!
There's me old rocker.
It's been 10 years since you nestled your bustle in that.
- You've done wonders, Pam.
- Thanks.
Tell me, what does Stella think of the changes?
You mean Stella Meredith?
- I haven't set eyes on her.
- You haven't?
I did write and ask her to tea.
Got a reply from the commander... saying she wasn't strong enough to accept invitations.
Not strong enough?
I expect it's us. We just aren't nice to know.
But Stella was crazy to make friends with you. She told me.
But where did you see her?
Oh, uh, just before
I left for London.
Why, you colossal bluff!
You were just as sorry for that child as I was.
Stop pushing her into the nursery.
She's 20. She said so herself.
You like her.
I can't help it.
There's kind of a sleeping-beauty magic about the kid.
I'd thought I'd done something toward breaking the spell.
Seems not.
Prince Charmless, that's me.
That'll do for tonight, Mr. Roderick.
It's time for Miss Pamela to go to bed. She looks tired out.
You're an old tyrant, Lizzie Flynn.
But you're perfectly right.
Put the lights out, Rick.
Now let's see. I think I turn it down and blow down the chimney.
Haven't done that since I was a kid.
Come now, Whiskey. Good boy.
- Are you having him in your room?
- He's used to it, the creature.
Get along up, now.
Haven't I carried you enough this day?
- Get on up, now.
- I'll give him a start.
What in the name of all the saints?
Well, he's not used to traveling and strange houses.
He'll find me if he wants me.
I've not slept with the sound of the sea since I left Ireland.
Would you like to go back there?
- I'd sooner see meself dead.
- Ah, go on with yez.
Why, whatever ails these candles?
It seems to be a rather drafty staircase.
Rick, I've had a swim every day from our own beach... and I've started to make a garden.
You learn the oddest things when you garden.
Did you know there's an upside-down to seeds?
- No. Good night, Pam.
- Good night, Rick.
- Good night, Master Rick.
- Good night, Liz.
Come in.
I thought you were asleep.
It turns cold in the night here sometimes.
Oh, thanks.
Rick, there's something I want to talk to you about.
Do you have any nice cast iron
I can swap for this mattress?
- We'll give you another tomorrow.
- Nothing will keep me awake tonight.
What price our house,
Pam? Pretty good, hmm?
- You're really pleased with it?
- I was never so happy in my life.
Oh, you starred to say something. What?
It was just that I was the one that got you to buy the house...
And I didn't appear very appreciative. Is that it?
It'll wait until tomorrow.
Bless you, Rick. Sleep well.
You too.
These are pretty good apples.
That concludes our broadcast for today.
Good night, everyone. Good night.
Pam, is that you?
- Rick.
- Pamela.
- We don't want to wake Lizzie.
- But isn't it Lizzie?
No, it isn't Lizzie.
It's coming from downstairs.
It comes from everywhere and nowhere.
Take hold of yourself, Pam. I'm going down and search the place.
Rick, I've searched.
- There's never anything there.
- "Never"? You mean you've heard it before?
YES.
Rick, it's true, isn't it? The sound,
I mean. You're hearing it too?
- Of course I'm hearing it.
- I wasn't sure.
- Pam...
- I thought I might be going crazy.
- Was that why you didn't tell me?
- Yes, that, and...
Rick, it's your home. It's all we've got to live in.
- It sounds so heartbroken.
- Now don't get rattled, Pam.
- There's a logical explanation for this.
- Such as?
You can't expect me to give it to you offhand, but it stands to reason.
- Does it come every night?
- No.
Just when you begin to think you dreamt it, it comes again.
Be calm, Pam. Be calm.
I'm all right.
It'll stop soon now.
How do you know?
It dies away at dawn.
Listen.
That's the dawn breeze.
- Well, that's all for tonight.
- It's a pity, really.
Hardly gives one time to look into it. Now listen, dear.
Look, let's talk tomorrow.
I'll die if I don't get some sleep.
Pam, leave your door open in case you're nervous.
All right, Rick.
And remember, you haven't a thing to worry about.
This business can be scientifically explained.
Probably a loose wire hidden around the house, acting as an aerial... picking up the sound of some woman in the village crying.
Was she crying when the last tenants were frightened out?
Well, maybe she had a sad life.
Anyway...
I'm here now, and I'm not the least rattled.
Not the least little bit in the world.
It's just silly to be upset.
Last night I heard it myself, Commander Beech.
A perfectly appalling sound of crying.
Mr. Fitzgerald, Windward
House belongs to you now.
- Why do you bring this matter to me?
- Because we want information.
I for practical reasons, and my sister because she believes it's a ghost.
- She'd like to know what the ghost wants.
- What utter bosh!
Bosh, I agree, but when did the noises start?
- You inherited the house, I believe.
- From my grandmother.
And there were no disturbances there in her time?
None. And if there are noises now, they're from perfectly natural causes.
An echo from a subterranean cave, perhaps.
That would've been heard in your grandmother's day.
Erosion may have changed the structure of the cliffs.
- It's not' a bad suggestion.
- May I come in, Grandfather?
No, you run along to church.
I'll join you in a few minutes.
- But I want to see Mr. Fitzgerald.
- I'm glad you're better.
"Better"? But I haven't been ill.
Stella merely suffers with a general delicacy.
- She doesn't accept invitations.
- Never?
Perhaps I'd better frankly state she's not strong enough to make new friends.
- Grandfather!
- Run along, my dear.
We're discussing something privately.
Is there anything else, Mr. Fitzgerald?
Just one more question. Was Stella's mother ever troubled at Windward House?
- What do you mean?
- Did she hear the crying?
My daughter was not one to circulate ridiculous rumors.
If she'd heard this, she'd have mentioned it, and she never did?
Certainly not.
Then the trouble must have begun since her death.
- Do you mean to imply...
- No, I'm merely trying to set the date.
- I didn't mean that your daughter haunts
- How dare you suggest such a thing?
Really, I'm most desperately sorry. Please forgive me.
Very well. I accept your apology.
But please understand one thing.
Your purchase of the property doesn't establish a social bond between us.
What's the matter with us? Why don't you allow Stella to see us?
Because I don't want to.
And I must ask for your word not to send her any more invitations.
I'll give you no such undertaking.
Very well. I shall know how to deal with the matter.
Stella is not going inside that house!
Great Scott! You believe the place is haunted.
I hoped you'd come along.
I wanted to talk to you.
- Quick, drive around the next corner.
- Get in.
You had four freckles on the boat. They've gone.
I couldn't go to see your sister.
Grandfather's been ill.
Turn here.
Now, what is this about your not seeing Pamela?
At the mention of me coming to Windward,
Grandfather almost had an attack.
You feel your mother never would've left him?
No, never.
Yet she did when she married, and he seemed to survive very nicely.
He was younger then.
Oh, so you're going to turn into one of these dim little ladies... who fill hot-water bottles for elderly relatives.
- Good-bye, Stella Meredith.
- I'm not now.
You're here now.
That's practically the nicest sentence that ever was spoken.
Would you and your sister be in if I came to Windward tonight?
Yes.
Supper's at 8:00, but please come as early as you can.
Bob down. He's passing the end of the lane.
He's gone.
How will I ever get to church?
Sit on the floor, and
I'll drive you past him.
- Drive to the side gate, please.
- Yes.
- Like a lift, Commander?
- No, thank you.
Oh! What a moment!
- Were you scared?
- Yes, but it was wonderful.
Well, good-bye. Say a little prayer for me.
Golly! How am I ever going to feel meek enough for church?
Oh, Stella.
Here's your prayer book and purse.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Thank you, Mrs. Carlton, Colonel.
- Until next Sunday.
- Yes.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
You seem very silent, Stella.
What have you against the
Fitzgeralds, Grandfather?
Well, they're hardly our sort.
I've decided to make friends with them.
You'll do no such thing.
Why do you say that, Grandfather?
I do not consider it suitable for you to visit Windward House.
- Not suitable?
- I can't discuss the matter.
- That's all the reason I'm going to get?
- It will have to suffice, yes.
No, Grandfather. I'm 20, and I'm... and it's time I stopped living somebody else's life.
- I shall go to Windward whenever I please.
- Did you hear what I said?
It isn't any good,
Grandfather. I'm on strike.
Stella, go to your room.
No use trying to lock me in.
There isn't any key.
Now don't be impertinent.
- Hello, Annie.
- Dinner will be late, miss.
I'm having ever such trouble with the lamb.
You'd better tell the commander.
Yes, it's very urgent. Will you try to hurry the call?
Thank you. I'm telephoning.
Close that door.
It's just that dinner will be late, sir. It's the lamb being awkward.
I won't be here for dinner.
And take some to Stella on a tray.
And close that door!
May I speak to Miss Holloway?
It's a trunk call, Miss Holloway.
A Commander Beech.
Thank you.
Yes, Commander Beech?
I want to consult you about
Stella, Miss Holloway.
It's a matter of the utmost urgency.
I can be with you late this afternoon.
I can't see you till this evening, but I shall be glad to put you up for the night.
Isn't it a little late to consult me about Stella?
Yes, I know that, but I beg you to help me now.
You're the only human being in the world to whom I can turn.
The only person who wouldn't think me demented... because I believe a house can be filled with malignity.
Malignity directed against a certain child.
The dining room isn't finished yet.
How glad this house must be to be lived in again.
I must dash back to Lizzie.
We're fighting... over how much sherry you put in a tipsy pudding.
She wants to make it dead drunk.
- Do you like tipsy pudding?
- I think I like everything to eat.
Show her the rest of the house before it's dark.
You've really never been here since you were three?
Not inside.
But I walked here once when I was ten and peered in at the windows.
There was a stupendous row... and the next week I got packed off to a school in Brussels.
- Did your grandfather give you reasons?
- "Reasons"?
If I'd ever been reasoned with,
I might have been a better child.
- My old nursery's through there, isn't it?
- I should think so. It had nursery wallpaper.
How pretty your sister's made it!
What is it?
Something I'd forgotten.
When I was little...
I used to have a dream about this room.
You did?
I'd be lying here, and it'd be dark... and cold and frightening.
And then... a little flame would come.
Just a tiny point of light so big... and yet suddenly everything would be... warm and light and peaceful.
And then... someone would come and put the flame out, and I'd be terrified.
Perhaps your mother used to bring you a night light.
But who'd take it out?
May I see the studio before it's dark?
It's rather messy in here.
I was thinking of skipping this.
This is where my father painted my mother's picture.
Strange to think of them here.
My father would have his easel to the light, wouldn't he?
And perhaps my mother would sit there in her soft, white dress.
But sometimes, of course, he'd paint the other one.
- "The other one"?
- He had a model, you know.
A foreign girl.
I've never been able to find out much about her.
People get awfully hush-hush when I ask them.
Between you and me and the grand piano...
I suspect Father was a bit of a bad hat.
- Artistic temperament?
- Very artistic, I'm afraid.
But sometimes, you know, it's quite a comfort to me.
- In what way?
- If Father had been as good as Mother... think how good I'd have been.
It's getting almost too dark to see you properly.
Won't you play something?
It's about time you asked me that.
- Oh, please go on.
- Just a second.
- You made that up?
- Yes.
- But you must be brilliant!
- Oh, dazzling.
- People have to wear sunglasses.
- What's it called?
It's a serenade.
"To Stella by Starlight."
You mean, this Stella?
But it's the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me!
Is it?
Please go on.
You see, this is the only way I can paint you.
Some black keys and some white... and fingers that are much too clumsy... but you're in it somehow.
It's gone awfully sad.
Why have you changed it?
It just came out that way.
What's the matter? What is it,
Stella? You're trembling.
I was wicked. How could I ever have laughed in her house?
But it's my house now, Pam's and mine.
But she was so young, and she died so cruelly.
Stella!
Stella!
- Rick, what is it?
- I don't know. It's that blasted room!
Stella, stop!
Stella!
For heaven's sake, Stella!
- What's the matter, Rick?
- You were going over the edge.
- Was I?
- If I hadn't caught you.
I hadn't any sense of danger at all.
Look.
I think this is where my mother fell. By the dead tree.
Are you all right?
Quite, thanks, except dying of hunger.
Then you must come and get some food.
Do you know this is our very first party in this house?
- Is it?
- Shall we sing her the song?
His introduction to music.
Stay here.
Lizzie, where are you?
What's the matter?
Mr. Roderick! Mr. Roderick!
- What is it, Lizzie? Are you hurt?
- The studio door... there's something there.
Look, Lizzie, there's nothing there.
There was! I saw it with me own two eyes!
What?
It was like a mist... a crawling mist.
You imagined it just because you heard the house was haunted.
I'd heard nothing of the sort, Mr. Roderick.
Holy saints! Are you tellin' me it is?
For heaven's sake,
Rick, what is it?
Oh, Lizzie's dreamed up a ghost for herself.
Come along, Lizzie.
Oh, darling Lizzie.
I'd just come upstairs to turn down the beds.
There it stood by the studio door, looking down at me.
- A woman, it was.
- Four steps back, it was just a mist.
'Twas a woman. I swear it.
The ghost of a woman!
Come and sit down. You'll be all right in a minute.
- Have some sherry, Lizzie.
- Just a drop.
I'll not sleep in this house another night, Mr. Roderick.
- Come now, Lizzie.
- I will not! I'd sooner die.
She can go to the Jessup farm.
What's happened to Stella?
She was with me when I came in.
Stella?
Stella, where are you?
Stella, are you in the house?
Stella!
Pamela! Pamela!
Stella, darling.
Yes, Rick? What's happened?
- Rick, what is it?
- She's in a dead faint.
- This room, it's like an icebox.
- Colder.
We'll have to get a doctor.
There's one at the first house in the village.
That's a girl.
Well, what kind of bogey did you see?
I didn't see anything.
Fainted out of sheer cussedness, huh?
I can only remember the cold coming.
Hello, Stella.
- Hello.
- You suddenly felt cold?
It wasn't just that.
- The room went cold, and I was frightened.
- Well, you just forget about it for a bit.
Miss Fitzgerald's got some soup for you.
See if you can get her to take some.
She'll do all right, but it's quite a nasty case of shock.
- That's all? You're quite sure?
- Sit down.
You see, I brought her here.
Take that neat.
Can, uh... Can she stay the night here?
Oh, yes. But suppose that spook starts howling?
Oh, your spook.
It's just an echo from a cave probably, but it sounds like a spook.
I'd rather risk it than move her tonight.
There was some rather queer business earlier this evening.
The cliff is so close, and she walked right to the edge. If I hadn't caught her...
We'll keep a close watch.
- Did she take her soup?
- Eight spoonfuls, then drifted off to sleep.
Splendid. She'll sleep for hours now.
- We'll keep on watch here.
- You'd better go to bed, Miss Fitzgerald.
- You're looking all in.
- I'd rather watch with you.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Thanks.
Pam, who do you think's moved in with Dr. Scott?
- Our Bobby.
- No!
I found the poor dog in the street.
He was in a pitiable state of nerves.
- How is he now?
- Fine.
- Bobby was the first to see the ghost.
- See? Pamela believes it.
Rick, stop hiding your head in the sand.
You heard the sounds last night.
Lizzie's been half frightened out of her wits... and Stella's been in deadly danger twice.
Everyone in the village knows the house is strange.
I expected support from you.
You must tell us everything you know about the place after I've made the coffee.
Unfortunately I'm a newcomer to Biddlecombe.
I've only lived here 12 years.
It's not ancient history to us. Please go on.
The model's name was Carmel.
She was a Spanish gypsy, and a thorough bad lot.
So was Meredith, from what I can gather.
- Didn't Mrs. Meredith suspect? - She must have. The thing was an open scandal.
The girl and he'd have been stoned out of the village if not for Mary Meredith.
She was very much admired. I suppose she just accepted the situation.
And she's still sobbing her hear: out about it.
- Where's Carmel now?
- Dead. She died in this very house... a week after Mary fell from the cliff trying to save her from suicide. Ironic, wasn't it?
- Is it known why the girl tried to kill herself?
- Meredith's said to have tired of her.
Think of it... those two women struggling on the cliff.
I wonder if Mary's death could have been murder.
It's been hinted at.
The whole story was dug up and embroidered when Stella's father died.
- When was that?
- Three years ago, abroad.
- He never came back to Windward.
- All of them dead with their secrets.
One of them's not quite dead enough for me.
Don't say that about the poor soul.
If a spirit comes back, it's for some particular purpose.
- That's my sister's special crotchet.
- We've got to find out what it is.
I wish I knew some more, but I'm afraid I don't.
- What time's your wailing lady due?
- About dawn.
We ought to know each other pretty well by then.
Twenty-one hand. I'm out.
- Is it my deal?
- It was, two hours ago.
Yes, Moaning Martha seems to have missed her cue.
Rick, have you brought some more flowers in?
No. Why?
Don't you notice the scent?
It's overpowering.
Extraordinary.
Heliotrope, isn't it?
No.
No, it's mimosa.
- There's a light!
- Where did that come from?
It's like a night-light.
She's gone!
Rick, the window!
- What is it?
- Where are you, Stella?
Don't be afraid, Stella.
- "Afraid"?
- Well, we were, a little.
I wanted to see the dawn with her.
"Her"?
Don't you know who it is in your house?
- It's my mother.
- You saw her?
I didn't see her... but when I woke, she was here in the room.
It was full of her scent. I could feel her presence everywhere.
And there was something else... something I've never known in my whole life.
What?
The knowledge that... someone loved me very dearly.
Come on, young Stella.
I'll take you home.
But I don't want to go.
Sorry, but I've got to get some sleep, you know.
- But I can come back?
- No.
What do you mean? You couldn't want to keep me away from her.
Stella, remember how ill you were last night?
But that was nothing to do with her.
I think I was just frightened after what Lizzie said.
I tell you, my mother would never hurt me.
I shan't be afraid again. Please.
I'm sorry. It's just that my knees are wobbly.
Come along. Dr. Scott will drive you home.
I wonder what I've done to her, bringing her here.
Don't blame yourself.
But that look in her eyes, that terrible happiness.
Wait a minute. Perhaps she's nearer right than we are.
- She's what?
- Perhaps she's right in being happy.
Supposing Mary Meredith's spirit had been searching for Stella... and now that it's found her, it's found peace.
Suppose we haven't a ghost anymore.
- Where are you going?
- To the studio.
How has it always shown itself in the past?
Sobbing sounds downstairs, and cold and depression in the studio.
There wasn't any sobbing tonight, only warmth and fragrance.
- But why the studio?
- I'll know in there.
I'll know whether it's a decent, human room. Won't you?
It may not be quite so cold, really.
Oh, stop it, Pam.
It's clammy and rotten.
Whatever it is, it's in here with us.
Let's get out.
Mary Meredith, please.
Please. We're sorry you had to suffer.
Isn't that enough?
What more do you want?
You were right about one thing, Pam:
We haven't a ghost anymore.
We've got two of them.
- Is Commander Beech at home?
- He won't be back until this evening, sir.
- It's Miss Stella I really want to see.
- Won't you come in? I'll tell her.
Thank you.
Miss Stella's in her room, sir. I'll...
- Rick.
- Stella.
- I knew you couldn't mean it.
- Mean what?
Haven't you come to take me to Windward?
No, Stella.
You mustn't go there again, ever.
Listen, darling...
I've thought this thing out, and you must go away from here.
- Go away?
- Yes, forever.
You wouldn't care?
Not in the least, because
I'll be coming with you.
It won't be luxury, just the smallest
London flat, but it'll be ours.
And no unseen, uninvited guests.
- And Windward?
- We'll tear it down and forget it.
And my mother?
But Stella, you're talking of a dream and a memory.
I'm talking about my mother.
She's been waiting for me.
In some queer sort of way, I always knew it.
What about me? I was under the impression you cared for me.
This hasn't anything to do with you.
You talk about destroying that house.
You'd be tearing me apart.
Stop it, Stella. Do you care for me or don't you?
I can't think about you, not while she's out there.
Take me there.
But this is horrible, unhealthy stuff. Put it out of your mind.
Turn your back on the past and run, run hard.
I'll go there somehow.
- You won't, I promise you.
- I hate you for that.
Stella.
You shan't make me forget her! You shan't!
That's enough, Bobby.
That's enough.
You'll get lipstick poisoning.
He's got a passion for hard-boiled eggs. Did you know?
And turnip tops.
I don't think he has any idea he's a dog. Not really.
Of course, he thinks he has a rather odd figure for a man.
I didn't question him very closely about where he belonged.
I was afraid I might find out.
I'm sorry now.
- Sorry?
- Yes. I should've met you sooner.
- Are you there, Scott?
- In here.
- Did you see Stella?
- Yes, I did.
You've got to do something.
She's on the edge of a collapse.
You're telling me? This is hardly a case for a country doctor, you know.
- When does the commander get back?
- Last train tonight.
- Heaven help young Stella then.
- Look here.
Can't you convince her her mother wouldn't want her to go near that house?
Not I. She's been listening for a voice that's been still for 17 years.
I can give her a sedative.
Why don't we try to get a message from Mary Meredith?
- Do what?
- We could hold a séance.
You're not serious?
That's how the dead are supposed to communicate with the living.
- According to the idiot fringe.
- You have no right to say that.
Many intelligent people believe in spiritualism.
- Have you ever been to a séance?
- I have.
Shaded lights, the alphabet laid out on the table, an upside-down wine glass... messages from somebody's Uncle Oswald, how to find a mislaid toothbrush. Oh!
Stop scoffing, Rick.
Not all séances are faked.
All right, we'll have a séance.
It shouldn't be difficult to move a glass around and say it's Mary Meredith.
- What do you think?
- Leave me out of this.
I won't let you cheat Stella.
What do you expect Mary
Meredith to tell her?
"Entrust your life to a tall, dark man, excruciatingly handsome"?
Crikey, no! I want to set Stella's mind at rest. She's just about torn in two.
Unless the conflict inside her is stopped...
- it may even affect her reason.
- Here's a message that might do it:
"Stella, this is your mother. Since
I've found you, I've found peace.
Stay away from Windward House."
- Stella would have to be at the séance.
- Naturally.
It'll have to be at Windward, and it's dangerous for her.
- We'd be with her all the time.
- All right. It may be worth a try.
The important thing is that we should all believe.
- Isn't it, Dr. Scott?
- So I understand. What now?
Everybody puts a finger on the glass.
Perhaps you should ask some questions, Stella.
Is anybody here?
Are you my mother?
You don't want me to stay away from Windward, do you, Mother?
Oh, I knew it, Mother.
And I want to be near you too.
Is that why you stay here, just to be near me?
But you're holding it, Rick.
And you, Dr. Scott. Holding it hard.
Take your fingers off.
Is that your reason, darling?
Just to be near me?
But what else?
I...
G...
U... A...
"I guard."
You mean, you guard me from some danger?
But what?
C...
A...
R...
- M...
- "Carmel."
- That's enough.
- It is indeed.
Let's go into the other room.
- Stella, what is it?
- Are you ill, Stella?
Quiet. Leave her alone.
Oigan. ¡Oigan!
- Stop her, Scott!
- She's in a trance.
I saw this happen once before at a séance. I thought it was a fake.
- But this isn't.
- I know. It's dangerous.
- May I ask her some questions?
- No!
It may be best to try and reach her mind.
Now keep your voice quiet and reassuring.
Are you Mary Meredith,
Stella's mother?
Ella no e'. Ella no e'!
¡No le crean na'!
¡No le pongan oido que está mintiendo!
Don't ask her any more!
That's the doorbell.
Shall I answer it?
Lizzie's at the Jessups'.
No. Don't move until she's over the worst of this.
¡So' ladrona!
!Ladrona de mi cariño!
- Spanish, isn't it, Scott?
- I don't know.
Rick, the mimosa scent!
The room's full of it!
Mary Meredith's in here too.
The cold.
It's never been cold in here.
The candles! Look at the candles!
- I'd better answer it.
- All right.
Stop, Pamela!
Don't go near that door.
It's coming toward us!
What in thunder is this?
- Stella dear, it's all right now.
- We must get her out.
What have you been doing to the child?
- What's the meaning of this, Dr. Scott?
- I can't explain now.
- This is incredible behavior!
- Quietly, Stella.
- There's nothing to be frightened of.
- Control yourself, child!
Don't speak to her like that!
You're responsible for this.
You and your meddling.
And so are you. Why didn't you tell us the truth?
- I warned you.
- Only of idle gossip.
Perhaps you'd like your money back. You shall have it, the entire purchase price.
No, thank you, Commander.
I know this now:
Stella will never be well until this house is cured.
Somehow we're going to cure it.
Dr. Scott, have the goodness to drive us home.
There. Now you'll sleep all right.
I'll be here early in the morning.
Stella is no longer your patient. Nor am I.
- But someone must look after her.
- That is not your concern, Dr. Scott.
- I shall be at your disposal at any hour.
- Thank you.
Everything will be all right.
Won't you come in, Miss Holloway?
- Is she asleep?
- Not yet.
Hello, Stella.
Miss Holloway.
Go to sleep, Stella.
Dr. Scott tells me she went into a trance tonight.
Spoke some words they thought were Spanish.
How did she happen to be at Windward?
The people who bought the place are searching into its past.
- Are they indeed?
- Can you make the child well again?
I hope so.
It won't be a short process.
She's far more ill than you imagine.
She won't want to go with you.
She's never outgrown her fear of you.
I could've cured it years ago if you'd let me have her... as Mary would have wished me to.
Her place was in Mary's home. I've taught her to be like Mary in every way.
- How can you say such a thing?
- She's not so beautiful, of course.
Mary was a goddess.
Her skin was radiant, and that bright, bright hair.
How this room brings her back to me.
The nights we sat talking in front of that fireplace... planning our whole lives.
It wasn't flirtations and dresses we talked about.
We were no silly, giggling girls.
- We intended to conquer life.
- You at least did.
Will you try to take
Mary's place with her now?
I'll do my best.
She's asleep.
If you'll call my chauffeur, he'll carry her downstairs.
It will be better for her to wake at my place.
I'm deeply grateful to you.
So they're searching into the past.
They shan't ever find out, my darling.
I promise you.
- Elizabeth Flynn, where are yez?
- I'm here, Mr. Roderick.
And will you please come here at once?
Don't we get any breakfast?
What's the matter?
Oh, that. That happened last night.
I am not talking about that.
- I'm talking about this.
- The anagram letters. Yes, yes.
Anagrams, is it?
Don't you try to bluff me, Mr. Roderick.
'Tis a heathen device to call devils out of hell.
Stop looking at me as though you were gonna take away my bicycle.
I will not stay in a house where it goes on, and that is an "ultimato"!
Come now, Lizzie. From now on we're through with all this rubbish.
- We're going after facts.
- What facts?
The facts about this blasted haunting.
Rick, why burden Lizzie with this?
Whist now, Miss Pam.
Where will we start, Mr. Rick?
I don't know. Everybody seems to be dead.
- The trained nurse isn't.
- What trained nurse?
She was here when it happened... the friend of the lady that went over the cliff.
Where did you hear all this?
What do you suppose we talk of at the Jessups?
It was the trained nurse that shouted down to Mr. Jessup on the shore.
- Was Jessup in on the tragedy?
- He was after some lost sheep.
The tide was out, so he went down.
And as he passed under the dead tree, he heard a scream.
- Mrs. Meredith?
- No.
'Twas the scream of a terrified child.
As he ran towards it, the poor lady came crashing down.
- 'Twas then that the nurse called.
- Lizzie Flynn, you're a gold mine.
- If we could only get the name of the nurse.
- Ah, that's easy. Wait, now.
- Mr. Jessup?
- Yes, Mrs. Flynn.
What was the name of
Mrs. Meredith's trained nurse... the one that got so famous and grand?
- Miss Holloway.
- Aye. Miss Holloway.
She has a big, fine place of her own now. A hospital, like.
'Tis on Bodmin Moor. She calls it the Mary Meredith Retreat.
- Mr. and Miss Fitzgerald?
- Yes.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.
Wait in there, please, and I will announce you to Miss Holloway.
The place is quite stunning, isn't it?
- Why are you whispering?
- Why are you?
A gentleman!
- How very unusual.
- Good afternoon.
Oh, dear me. Yes. Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Are you by any chance waiting to see Miss Holloway?
Yes, we have an appointment.
What lucky people!
And what luck for me too, because
I'm sure you won't mind.
- But perhaps you will.
- Is there something we can do?
Oh, if you'd be so very kind. You see... this isn't my day for an interview and I want her to have these.
What are they, bird's eggs?
But that's very funny, because, you see, I'm Miss Bird.
They're just little stones... because she likes simple things and she has so many flowers.
- There isn't much else one can find.
- Well, I'll give them to her.
Thank you.
And now, I... think I'll just go out for a little walk.
Go back to your work at once, Miss Bird.
Don't forget.
Will you come this way, please?
- Shall I take them?
- No, I'll deliver them.
As you wish.
Come in.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
This is so kind of you.
I was asked to give you these by a Miss Bird, I believe.
Poor Miss Bird. Our saddest case.
They're really very fine stones, aren't they?
I must remember to thank her for them.
She comes to me once a week for a little chat.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Forgive our ignorance. We know so very little of your work.
Is it with mental patients?
Not patients, Miss Fitzgerald.
Just guests.
In a way this is like a hotel... where there are beautiful things to look at, music to hear... and a little sympathy.
But don't let's talk about me.
You told me on the telephone about disturbances at Windward.
How can I help you?
We thought perhaps you could tell us what Mary and Carmel were really like.
They were extraordinary women, both of them.
Mary Meredith was the finest human being I ever knew.
- Is that she?
- Yes.
- And Carmel?
- Oh, she was exceptional too.
I never saw such intensity of evil.
She was a Spanish gypsy.
Crafty, cruel.
- I'm sorry.
- Why did Mrs. Meredith put up with it?
She thought Meredith should be the one to end the affair.
- And did he?
- Yes, in time.
She and Meredith took the girl to Paris... found a position for her, left her well supplied with money.
Then they came back here with their baby.
For a time it seemed as if there were some possibility of happiness.
- And then?
- Carmel came back.
She still wanted Mary's husband.
You know how it ended.
A neighbor of ours spoke of something we can't quite understand.
He mentions a child crying on the cliff that night.
A terrified child.
That's a part of the story so ugly,
I've never mentioned it before.
We're sorry to distress you.
That night, the girl Carmel had been told she must leave Windward.
If she could've killed both Mary and her husband, she'd have done so.
A better plan flashed into her wicked little brain.
She went into the nursery, picked up their baby, and raced to the cliff.
- Good heavens!
- Mary was after her in a second...
Meredith and I close behind. Carmel reached the cliff by the dead tree.
For a moment I saw them struggling... then Carmel raised her arm and struck Mary down.
Then it was murder?
The will to kill had always been there, I think.
Directed against Stella.
Can that be what survives?
Maybe that accounts for Stella's queer business on the cliff.
- What was that?
- Something in that house... drove her out toward the edge, and if
I hadn't caught her, she'd have gone over.
Would she indeed?
How very curious.
Please, finish your story.
It was finished.
Everything was finished.
Meredith went down the cliff.
Mary was dead when he reached her.
- And Carmel?
- She ran out into the storm.
Next morning, she crawled back in the early stages of pneumonia.
I fought for Carmel's life day and night... hating her all the time!
How awful for you.
I'm sorry, I discipline others.
I... I can't discipline myself.
There. Have I told you everything you want to know?
All except one thing.
That last night, who told Carmel she must go?
Why, Mary... I should say Meredith.
It's the one decent thing
I ever knew him to do.
This... This is all extremely...
I'm sorry.
May I offer you tea?
Thank you, but we must get back before our maid leaves.
She won't stay at
Windward after dark.
I'm afraid I haven't been much help with your problem.
Well, thank you anyway, and good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Good afternoon, my dear.
- Did you want to see me?
- I've been asking for you all day.
I'm being treated as though I were insane.
Has anyone used that word?
- I've told them a thousand times...
- It isn't a question of a word.
My door's kept locked, and there's a queer look in their eyes.
- Oh, you feel persecuted.
- No.
About the cliff at
Windward, Stella... what did you feel as you ran toward it?
I didn't feel anything.
I was sad in the house.
Was it as though some will were directing you...
- a will stronger than yours?
- The sea sounded loud and beautiful.
- I just went in that direction.
- In fact, you don't quite know.
- I want to see my grandfather.
- You will in time.
Does Grandfather know what this place is like?
That woman who laughs...
I hear laughing all night!
And that other woman that...
Your grandfather's sorry that you have to be here... but he knows you'll be better soon.
"Better"? But I'm perfectly all right!
I wouldn't say that, Stella dear.
And please don't keep asking to see me.
Why do you hate me, Miss Holloway?
You see? You do feel persecuted.
Rick, if I should ever happen to lose my mind...
I don't think you'll lose it.
It might rattle to one side.
But if I do, no Mary
Meredith Retreat for me.
Plain, old-fashioned lunatic asylum, not that creepy horror.
You'll have a lovely talk with
Miss Holloway once a week.
- You think she was lying to us?
- About the past? Why should she?
She wasn't gonna tell us about the baby, and later she made that one break.
Admitting it was Mary who told Carmel to go.
Why try to hide it? It was a normal human reaction.
Made me like Mary better, as a matter of fact.
I was getting awfully bored with her perfection.
Why should Miss Holloway want to turn her into a plaster saint?
Maybe she likes plaster saints.
She's one herself.
Thank you, Doctor.
I assure you that when that healthy young man laughs, he isn't being delirious.
Good-bye, Doctor.
- Hello. Come in.
- Hello.
- What news of Stella?
- None, and I won't be having any.
Her grandfather's kicked me out.
Where have you been all day?
- To Bodmin Moor and back.
- Seeing a Miss Holloway.
What, Holy Holloway of
"wealth through harmony"?
- What do you know about her?
- Nothing, except that...
Dr. Rudd, my predecessor, had some sort of prejudice against her.
She says Carmel killed Mary Meredith.
Yes, she was there.
Nursed Carmel afterwards.
- Could we talk to Dr. Rudd about her?
- Only if we have another séance.
- I wonder...
- What?
It's only the very faintest chance, of course, but come on upstairs.
190s to '11, '12 to
'15, '16 to '19.
Here we are.
- It happened in the winter.
- Yes, let's start with November.
From his handwriting, Dr. Rudd must have been 200 years old.
Measles, measles, measles, whooping cough, measles, appendicitis...
Pleasant change for the old boy.
Here we are. "Called to Windward House.
Meredith's model, Carmel
Quesada: double pneumonia."
"Quesada girl much worse. No attempt to warm the bedroom.
- Found traces of snow on the floor."
- Snow? Then the window was left open.
"Spoke severely to nurse.
Returned to Windward this evening. Patient dead.
Nurse Holloway threatened me with legal action... when I used the words
'criminal negligence."
- But that means...
- To a doctor of Rudd's generation... it was apt to mean murder.
- Miss Holloway murdered Carmel.
- Doctor.
- In a quiet, ladylike way.
- Doctor!
Yes, Edith?
The commander's maid's on the phone. You're to come at once.
- Is it Miss Meredith?
- It's the commander.
- Took awful bad, the maid says.
- All right, Edith. You take this home.
There may be some other details.
I'll be along later.
He's in here, Doctor.
I undid his shoes. It was all I knew how to do.
- Bad one this time, Scott.
- Yes, I know.
Hold that under his nose.
Want an apology, Scott?
You'd get it, if you stuck out for it.
No, thanks. I'll have you right in a jiffy.
- Who's there?
- Who do you suppose is there?
Hello, Lizzie.
I'm sitting in your mother's chair, and if any ghost comes along...
I'll let out a scream that will frighten the life out of it.
Why? What's happened?
I feel all the wickedness of this house gathering around.
- Come on, now. Hop off to the Jessups'.
- I'm not going.
I'll be found dead in me bed in the morning... stiff with fright, and me death will be on you.
Me?
How do I know what devilment you'll be up to when me back is turned?
I promise we'll do nothing tonight that the priest wouldn't approve of.
Lord bless you, Mr. Rick.
I was hoping you'd say that.
I'll go and get me hat and coat.
- Find anything new?
- Nothing after that entry.
- How about a whiskey and soda?
- Less soda than usual, thanks.
Awful if we took to drink, both of us.
But it's an ideal house for delirium tremens.
Before you take a sip... don't you smell mimosa?
Yes. Are you scared?
Well, I wish I'd wake up.
It came from the nursery last night.
- You have the great nose of the family.
- Not a trace of it now.
- It's strongest here.
- It's almost overpowering.
I wish you'd tell us what you want, Mary Meredith.
- Mr. Rick?
- Yes?
I forgot to ask: Did you find out anything today?
- Just turned up a couple of murders.
- Holy saints preserve us!
Answer the door.
It's probably Dr. Scott.
- Good evening, Dr. Scott.
- Evening, Lizzie.
- In here.
- Good night, Miss Pam.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- I'm glad to find you here.
- How's the commander?
It's not him I'm worried about. It's Stella.
- What's the matter with her?
- She's at Miss Holloway's.
- No!
- We've got to get her out, tonight.
That's the way I feel, but don't let's get hysterical.
After all, Miss Holloway was her mother's best friend.
The idea of her spending an hour in that place is horrible.
- Can you get the old boy's permission?
- He's too ill. We've no authority.
- Then we'll do it without.
- Shall we take the casebook?
- Might be able to frighten her with it.
- Yes. No, wait.
We'll describe what we found and then pile it on, huh?
Let's get to a telephone.
Yes?
Oh, it's no bother at all, Miss Fitzgerald.
I'll be glad to see you again.
Are you motoring?
In two hours.
Good-bye.
Bring in Miss Meredith.
I may need the car this evening.
Good evening, my dear. Come in.
Sit down.
I thought you'd feel more at home here.
I do, Miss Holloway.
I've been giving your problem the most serious consideration.
It's not much of a problem.
I just want to go home.
To your grandfather's?
I couldn't permit that.
You've never been very happy there.
- Where would you really like to be?
- You mean Windward?
That's the basis of all your trouble, being kept away from there.
- Do you think she wants you there?
- Yes, I think she does.
And what she wants, I want.
I've talked with the Fitzgeralds.
They're very fond of you.
They'll let me stay there with them?
For the present, your grandfather's not to know you've left here.
It would worry him.
You must go straight to Windward.
Is that clear?
Miss Holloway, I'm the happiest person in the world!
There's a train in 40 minutes.
My car will take you to the station.
Good evening. Won't you come in?
- I must announce you!
- Don't bother. We'll announce ourselves.
Good evening. So you've thought of more questions?
- Why didn't you tell us Stella was here?
- The presence of my guests is confidential.
- We've come to take her.
- This is Stella's doctor.
Oh, I begin to understand.
This is a rescue party.
Take me to Stella at once.
There was a time when I would have resented such impertinence... particularly from a doctor whose conduct leaves so much to be desired.
- Please stop beating about the bush.
- I couldn't be angry with anyone tonight.
You know, those moments when the light is very clear... when the scales at last swing into perfect balance.
- Where is Stella?
- Tell them, Miss Ellis.
She's on the train for
Biddlecombe. The 9:20.
On her way home.
- Is that true?
- She'll be there long before you.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
She wasn't very happy here. I can't be of any help to people who are unhappy.
- She went to her grandfather's?
- No.
- Not to Windward House?
- Better than that.
To the cliff, and the rocks below the cliff.
You let her?
That's were Mary went.
That's where she died.
She's out of her mind. Come on!
Stella has a 20-minute start!
The sea has such a lonely sauna.
- Every seventh wave...
- You'd better look after her.
Miss Holloway! What's the matter?
Get out of this room!
I've done what she wanted at last.
Haven't I, Mary?
It's all straight now.
There are no frayed edges.
No loose ends.
All straight.
All smooth.
These local trains are very slow, you know.
But this one had a head start.
You needn't worry. She can't get into the house.
- You did lock the door, didn't you, Pam?
- No, I thought you did.
- Will you be all right, miss?
- Oh, yes.
I'll be all right now.
I'll be with my friends.
Pamela? Rick?
Pamela, are you there?
Rick?
Where are you? Please.
Lizzie?
Is that you?
Stella.
Stella.
Grandfather! Grandfather!
Stella, my child.
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?
Someone telephoned... from Miss Holloway's.
And you walked all that way?
Well, I had to get here.
Don't try and talk, darling.
I'll get Dr. Scott.
Oh, dear. There's no telephone in this house.
- Go. Go!
- You can't be left alone.
But the danger is for you.
- Please get out of this house now.
- Now lie back quietly.
I'm not afraid of anything here.
Then be afraid. Be afraid, for heaven's sake.
When you were a little child... after her death... the evils of this house reached out for you.
I took you away then.
- If I could only take you now.
- It's all right. We're together.
Stella! Go!
- Go...
- Grandfather!
I won't be afraid, Mother.
Stella!
Stella!
Stella, stop!
Hold on, darling.
We've got you now, darling. Hang on.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Sure?
Dr. Scott, Grandfather's in the studio. He's terribly ill.
We'd better get to him at once.
There's nothing I can do, my dear.
I knew.
She killed him just as she tried to kill me.
- My own mother!
- No, Stella.
But I tell you, I saw my mother just as my father painted her.
- It must have been Carmel.
- It wasn't.
Steady, Stella.
Unless...
Unless perhaps Miss
Holloway was right.
Perhaps it's my mind.
- Oh, Rick!
- No, darling.
The mimosa scent... it's flooding the room.
It's all right, darling.
Nothing will hurt you.
But I'm not frightened. This is what
I felt in the nursery that night.
The book!
What's doing it?
- The wind.
- But what about the mimosa?
We're letting our imaginations play hob with our senses.
"11:15 a.m. Mary Ann Hardy.
Broken arm. Second this year."
It's imagination, all right.
- Oh, what did I expect?
- Wait a minute.
"3:20 p.m. Called to
Windward House... to attend Meredith's model, who had fainted.
It didn't take much skill to find the reason.
Girl in poor physical condition... but I'm sure her great happiness will carry her through."
- Then Carmel had a baby too!
- "5:10 p.m. Mrs. Meredith came to see me.
Expected tears, hysteria.
Instead, icy control... and a dominating desire that the girl's condition be kept secret.
I should have more sympathy with the lady if I did not know how she herself... has feared and refused motherhood."
What can it all mean?
- Where were you born, Stella?
- In Paris.
Where they took Carmel before they came back with their baby.
- But surely you don't think...
- I think Mary adopted Carmel's child... gave her a home on the condition that Carmel never came back.
Only she couldn't live up to it.
She had to be near her baby.
But it doesn't fit.
The mimosa scent... that comes with the gentle ghost, that was Mary's scent.
- Stella's father told her.
- No.
No, my father only wrote that it was my mother's scent.
- I'm Carmel's child!
- Oh, Stella, don't mind too much.
"Mind"? Can't you see what it's done for me?
Always there's been something fighting in me... something that couldn't be calm and cold like Mary.
I can be myself now.
That's what she's waited all these years to tell you.
Oh, Mother, now I know.
She's happy now.
- The scent's gone.
- She won't cry anymore.
She's gone forever.
Will you come back to my house now, Stella?
- Come along, darling.
- All right.
- Get her out through the nursery, quick!
- Right.
- What is it, the cold?
- Go on, Pam!
- What are you going to do?
- Help Stella, please.
Mary Meredith, where are you?
It's time somebody faced that icy rage of yours.
What do you want?
It's Stella, isn't it?
It's too late, Mary. You see, we're on to you now.
You told Carmel to clear out and leave her baby, but Meredith wouldn't stand for it.
To spite them, you tried to kill their child and instead went hurtling over the cliff yourself.
Gives your saintly legend a black eye, doesn't it?
So you don't like the sound of laughter, do you?
But that's all you'll get from now on.
I should think you'll be on your way now, Mary Meredith.
We've had enough. We're not frightened of you anymore.
From now on, this house is for the living.
Rick, are you all right?
Let' me in, Rick!
- Oh, Rick!
- You all right, Fitzgerald?
Yes, fine. She's gone, Stella.
Look!
He'd never go near those stairs before.
Bobby'll be back tomorrow.
I think we'll be having other plans for Bobby.
- You're still shaking, Rick.
- Well, I've had a narrow escape.
She might have been my mother-in-law!

For heaven's sake, don't play the Queen of spades.
She's unlucky.
What's the matter?
They're all unlucky for me tonight.
But you can back any spade.
My win.
Your win.

Your win.

Mine.

What a fool to risk the Queen.
You win.
Good night, Andrei Andreiovich.
Thank you.
Don't go, Petrov. Don't leave us.
I think I'll be getting to bed.
Have a glass of wine first.
All my year's pay is gone.
Oh, never mind.
You'll have another year's pay in another year's time.
Petrov, I challenge you.
I challenge you to one more hand.
Fyodor, no, no. It's getting too late.
Gentlemen, let's drink.
There's food on the side tables. Help yourselves.
I want to go on playing.
I don't care if I lose every kopek.
Who'll play for double stakes?
Sit down. We'll have another hand later.
No need to scare. Leave me alone.
Hey, why doesn't he play?
Yes, you , sir. Standing here every night like a French spy watching us.
Haven't the engineers quarters of their own?
Don't listen to him, German.
It's only the wine talking.
I want an answer to my question.
Stop it, Fyodor !
Captain Suvorin is here as my guest.
He has every right not to play, if he doesn't care to.
Well, I beg your pardon.
But tell me this, sir.
If you're so interested as to come here night after night,
Why do you never touch a card?
Tell us !
Yes, I've often wondered how he can resist playing.
Are you trying to work out a system ?
Pray, it interests me very much.
But I cannot afford to risk unnecessarily the hopes of winning the Super Cross.
Marshenka!
Bravo !
Bravo !
I'll show them all one day.
Why does German Suvarin come here every night ?
Yes, why ?
He never plays cards. He's the sort of man who'd be afraid to stake anything unless he was sure of winning.
Can anyone be sure of winning ?
No.
What was that you were telling us about your old grandmother, Fyodor ?
The Countess Ravenskaya?
She's a wonderful old woman.
Is it true she's over a hundred ?
Are you speaking of old Countess Ravenskaya ?
Why? Do you know her?
No, but I soon shall.
My aunt is going to persuade her to ask General Volkoninov to make me his aide-de-camp.
Oh, really?
My aunt swears she's the most grotesque creature you ever saw.
With a high powdered wig like they used to wear fifty years ago.
And a quilling to match.
I believe she's a witch.
Nonsense!
That's absolute rubbish.
But it is true that the old countess had the secret of how to win at cards.
It's certainly true though that on one occasion she won an immense amount of money.
By selling her soul to the devil.
For a secret like that I'd sell mine.
The secret of how to win at cards?
Get to bed! Drunkard!
Yes, sir.
Shut the stove.
Good night, sir.
Get out !
Good night, your honor.
I'm sorry about Fyodor Pavelvich's behavior tonight.
I...
I came to apologize.
Thank you.
You seemed less put out by it than I was.
Perhaps you prefer me not to come to your card parties.
Oh, no, of course not. Why should I?
I mean...
I may embarrass you.
You see, I'm only a poor captain in engineers.
You are rich aristocrats.
Guard officers.
I think you're exaggerating things a bit.
You see, poor old Fyodor was..
Well, he was well in his cups and...
German, why not come back?
Don't you like listening to the gypsies?
Gypsies.
Why not call them what they are?
Don't be quite so hard on them, German.
What chance have they born in such circumstances?
You never blame anyone, do you?
No, not if I can help it.
I believe all human beings are fundamentally good.
I'm convinced of it.
Oh, yes?
Yes, and I believe also... that evil is a force, a mighty force that is abroad in the world to take possession of men's souls, if they will allow it to.
I'm not interested in problems as good and evil.
To me they're beside the point.
Why don't you come back, German?
No.
But, aren't you fascinated by that gypsy dancer,
Marchenka?
Yes, I've seen her.
Don't you agree?
I've told you.
I'm not interested in that sort of woman.
Then perhaps you'll come as my guest.
You're very kind. But no, thank you.
Look here, German,
I know I have to be careful about money.
But, after all, we have been paid today.
And you needn't spend much.
I cannot afford to spend anything.
You're always too proud to accept anything from anyone, aren't you?
Well, deuce, you're quite right.
It's senseless to go back there.
I could do with some sleep.
Good night.
Good night.
So they have paid you at last, have they?
It must be almost a year.
Ten months.
Don't you want to keep one of these things?
I've taken enough for my needs.
I've never saved a kopek in my life.
I've spent it all on food, and drink, and women.
So here I am.
Fifty-four and a wretched notary.
Vodka?
But I'm content. If I was to be put under the ground tomorrow....
I wouldn't grumble.
I've got everything I want out of life.
God's been very good to me.
Everything a man could want.
Well, I haven't.
You've done very well.
You're a captain.
Yes, in engineers at my age.
Over here no one can win promotion unless he's rich.
Or unless he has some important and powerful relatives to use their influence on his behalf.
Exceptional men have stifled and never had the chance to succeed.
Look at France.
Napoleon Bonaparte, he was a general at 26.
My advice to you is to be content.
As I am.
Take life as you find it.
I'd rather take it by the throat and force it to give me what I want.
You've forgotten your receipt.
I deducted five rubles for my fee, if that's agreeable.
As you wish.
This is a very rare book.
I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.
It tells of strange things that some say are better left alone.
How much is it?
Three rubles.
That's a lot, I know.
But there are plenty of people who believe in things neither looked for nor heard of.
What mean these premonitions, these hauntings, these apparitions?
These tales of horror in a far site in time and space.
Believe me, there are things to be seen the eye has not seen.
And things to be heard the ear has not heard.
Who knows what you may learn from it?
Why, you might end up by gaining a fortune.
Or losing your precious soul.
Containing the true stories of people who sold their souls in return for wealth, power or influence.
Chapter 4.
The Secret of the Cards.
Countess R***
Countess Ranevskaya.
In the year 1746, sixty years ago...
The Count of Saint Germain arrived in St. Petersburg.
He chose for his residence a deserted palace on the outskirts of the city and soon there were strange rumors about the weird dwelling and its mysterious occupant.
It was certainly true that in the vaults of the palace he had a curious collection of wax figures... which... so it was whispered... contained the souls of those who had fallen under his evil influence.
He would derive intense pleasure from modeling the wax figures of his intended victims.
Each one of whom was chosen with deliberate appreciation.
Thus the Countess Ranevskaya, acknowledged the most beautiful woman in Russia, came to excite his attention.
He had learned that in spite of a jealous husband all the men of fashion vied with each other for her favors.
Go now. Later.
Countess.
Who is it? What do you want?
I think you will need my master's help.
I need no one's help.
You will, Countess. You will need it tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Can he see into the future then?
He can see a long way.
Who is he?
He is known as Saint Germain.
You will find him at the Dolgoruki Palace.
When the last of the guests had left, the countess went down the secret stairway. to admit the young stranger she had promised to meet.
She alone had the key to the hidden door.
But in the early hours of the morning...
What are you doing?
Where's the money?
I beg you. I beseech you.
The money's not mine. My husband will find out.
Do you wish to ruin me?
I have no wish but to save myself from ruin, Countess.
Give me the key.
Why, you pray?
A common thief parading as a gentleman?
You should take more care, madame... with your amorous escapades.
My husband.
Anna, is anything the matter?
Give me the key.
Anna!
Why don't you answer me?
She was haunted by the fear of scandal.
The money belonged to her husband's regiment,
Somehow she must replace it without delay.
In her despair she remembered the strange message from Saint Germain.
She had no alternative but to answer the mysterious summons.
Nothing else could save her.
She would sell her soul... anything... to save herself.
She went to the Dolgoruki Palace.
Go!
Saint Germain gave her the secret of the three winning cards.
In return she made the solemn vow that no one else would ever know the secret.
Holy Virgin, have mercy.
Have mercy on me.
One hour later she was on the way to the gaming rooms.
Accept this pledge.
She played the three cards in succession.
She won a fortune.
But the horrors of her visit to Saint Germain... left a mark on her soul for the rest of her life.
Please, sir, spare a kopek.
Please, please, sir.
Spare a kopek.
Please, sir, spare a kopek.
Please, please.
Who owns that house?
Countess Ranevskaya.
Not often she gives a ball.
Countess Ranevskaya.
She's still alive?
Oh!
Will you do me a favor?
I like the army.
Oh, that's very good for me.
What is it?
Well, you see...
A secret of the heart.
Yes, yes...
Do you know the young woman in the house?
Lizaveta Ivanovna?
Of course I know her.
This is her dress I've got here now.
Wants to make it look new, poor thing.
As if we could work miracles.
Is there a chance of meeting Lizaveta Ivanovna?
Oh, I don't know. The old countess never lets her out of her sight.
It's come here, do this, do that, all day long.
This coat of mine needs seaming.
Look, the seam here... could you?
Lizaveta!
Ana Fyodorovna.
Why do you come creeping into the room?
You're like the rest of them in this house.
The sudden shock might bring on a heart attack, you'd hope.
If you think me capable of such wicked thoughts,
Anna Fyodorovna, would it not be better for me to go?
Go? And where could you go, pray?
Is that the gratitude you give your benefactress... for taking you, a poor orphan, into her care?
You cannot want me here if you think I wish for your death.
Why are you dressed up like that, pray?
Whom are you intending to captivate?
The prince my grandson was announced just now.
You said we were going for a drive, Anna Fyodorovna.
Drive in this weather?
It's calm out. There's not a breath of...
What's that you said?
It's calm out, and quite mild.
Nothing of the sort. It's windy and bitterly cold.
You don't wish to go, then?
I should think not.
Sit down and read to me.
But Anna Fyodorovna...
But, but! Always objections.
I was about to remind you that Prince Fyodor is here.
Hm, well...
Now get the book.
What were we reading?
Don Juan, Countess.
I think it's on the shelf here.
Love stories, love stories.
Always reading love stories.
What are you doing there?
Not there, not there!
Close it!
Close it, I said! Close it!
How dare you!
You're a wicked, wicked girl.
I'm sorry, Anna Fyodorovna.
I had no idea there was anything there. I'm...
Where is the key to that door?
Give it to me.
I have no key, Anna Fyodorovna, I tell you...
Have you used that staircase to admit others to your room?
How could you say such...
Lies and duplicity!
No one in this house speaks the truth, not anyone.
I will see, Lizaveta Ivanovna.
We shall find the key missing.
Oh...
There it is... after all.
Prince Krykulin and Prince Narumov.
Quick! Give me my stick!
Give me my stick.
How do you do, grandmother?
Allow me to present my friend, Andrei Andeievich,
Prince Narumov.
Be seated. And you too, Fyodor.
No, no, no!
Oh, my poor little one.
Narumov... Narumov... yes.
I remember your dear mother quite well.
Princess Darya Petrovna.
That was my grandmother, Countess.
Your grandmother?
Oh, yes, yes.. Of course.
I was forgetting.
What have you been reading lately, Fyodor?
You must bring me some of the latest French novels.
Not one where the heroine drowns herself for love.
Varvaruschka!
What is it, my little one.
Oh, there. Tell old Varvaruschka all about it.
I know I oughtn't to mind anymore.
But she's so cruel Varvaruschka, darling.
Why should she be so cruel?
She's old. She's near the grave and she hasn't found peace, poor soul.
I was so happy once.
A home, my mother, my father.
So happy.
You will be again, poor lonely heart.
Will I?
Sometimes I feel I'll never leave this house.
I know.
Little caged bird.
But you'll see. Be patient.
And someday soon, perhaps, you will meet someone who will love you very much.
He will help you to be free and happy again.
Where is that dog taking us?
This is not the way to the bird market.
It's the way we always come, Anna Fyodorovna.
Well, it looks quite different to me.
Lizaveta Ivanovna?
Orderly Narumov. I came with Fyodor Pavlovitch the other day
I hoped to be presented to you but you ran away.
Yes, of course, Prince Narumov.
May I accompany you?
Yes, if you wish.
I have to buy some more little birds for the countess's aviary.
Your honor.
Buy a nice fat duck, sir.
Buy a duck, sir.
A duck, buy a nice fat duck.
Yes, your honor?
I hate to see caged birds.
How can one enjoy their singing?
If I ever come into a fortune I shall buy all little birds.
Every one of them.
And I shall set them free and watch them fly away into the clouds.
Go tell Lizaveta Ivanovna to come at once!
I cannot be kept here waiting all day.
Yes, Excellency.
Will you be at the Opera next week?
Yes, I will.
Do you think I might see you there?
Please do, if you wish.
Perhaps we might continue our conversation.
Do you think, Lizaveta Ivanovna,
I might come to your box in the theater?
Oh, I do. Yes, indeed I do. Please excuse me now,
I daren't keep the countess waiting.
Come on, Andrei, drink up.
What's the matter with you?
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.
You've got all the symptoms of a man in love.
Have I?
Do I know her?
In a sense, yes.
Do you remember your grandmother's young companion?
Lizaveta Ivanovna?
Why she's a pathetic little creature.
Is she?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you knew her.
Where on earth did you manage to see her?
I met her accidentally one day at the bird market.
She was buying some canaries for your grandmother.
My dear old fellow, you're not really serious about this, are you?
Yes.
I've never been more serious in my life.
Come on, have a drink.
Come in.
Oh, so you're in.
I wonder why you stopped coming to our card parties.
Why don't you come tonight?
No, thank you.
I'm not interested in cards at the moment.
Forget hard work for once.
Oh, I'm not working, I'm... writing a love letter.
You writing a love letter?
But you've never written one in your life, have you?
Why, have you?
Well, not properly, no, but I know now what it's like to be in love.
Then tell me how you would compose a letter of this sort.
I mean, what burning phrases would you use?
I should say, "I love you to distraction."
"Your dark eyes have driven away my rest and peace.
Oh, if you could but love me."
I have got a letter for you.
This can't be for me.
But it is.
It couldn't be. I don't know this person.
German Suvorin.
I've never heard of him in my life.
Well, it's addressed to you.
No. There must be some mistake.
Of course it's for you.
You read it through properly and see.
Why have you torn it up if it isn't for you?
You must go now.
What shall I say?
Haven't you got a message for him?
Tell him please not to write to me again.
I love you to distraction.
Your dark eyes have driven away my rest and peace.
Your dark eyes have driven away my rest and peace.
Lisaveta, if you could but love me.
To Lisaveta Ivanovna.
I revere you...
I esteem and admire you.
You are dearer to me than language has the power of telling.
You are dearer to me than language has the power of telling.
Don't touch my arm like that or I shall be black and blue.
That will do. That's enough.
Don't fidget me, my dear.
I'm quite capable of walking by myself.
I will be waiting for you at the entrance of the Opera House.
Who's there? Who's there?
It's I, grandmama. Pray don't disturb yourself.
I cannot withstand people creeping about me like this.
How are you, my dear boy?
Liza, make room for the prince.
No, please. I can see well enough from here.
If you don't meet me tonight, I shall kill myself.
And you will be responsible for my death.
Fyodor Pavlovitch, you're making fun of me.
No, I assure you. You've made a conquest.
Who is it, then?
A very charming friend of mine.
Is he in the army?
Yes.
In the engineers?
No, he's in the horse guards with me.
Don't you recall the occasion I brought him to the countess' house and we heard you crying on the staircase?
Yes, of course...
Oh, so that's who it is.
But why the engineers, Lizaveta Ivanovna?
Oh, no particular reason.
Come now. You're blushing.
I've just discovered your little secret.
Nothing of the sort. There's no secret at all.
What are you whispering about?
The music, Grandmama.
Well, pull up your chair. You can't see from there.
I do not like that dress, Lizaveta.
A girl of your age should not expose herself like that. especially when we are together.
Now remember, you must make yourself as agreeable as possible for the countess.
Flatter her a little.
What, Aunt Katya?
Flatter! Flatter her a little.
Oh, yes, I see.
What sort of thing should I say?
Why, any odd words, my dear boy.
What would you say to some charming young girl?
I don't know, Aunt Katya.
Pay her some compliments.
Be gay and amusing.
Countess Ranevskaya.
Yes.
I have my nephew with me.
He's the grandson of your old friend, Count Dobrinski.
He's been pleading me to present him to you.
Where is he?
Nicky... Nicky!
So you're Dobrinski's grandson.
I should never have known it.
He was the handsomest man in the Imperial Guard.
And I dare say he still is.
I didn't really know my grandpapa, Countess.
I can just remember a great fat man with a purple face who was always hitting the servants with his stick and making us all laugh.
It must be fifteen years since he died but I can still remember his coffin being carried out.
What is the boy saying?
Yes, it was most unfortunate.
Most unfortunate.
Why unfortunate, Aunt Katya.
After all, he was nearly eighty.
What else could you expect at that age?
We shall be seeing you at the ball tomorrow.
Young lout.
Oh, Andrei.
Who's that?
Oh, make room for Prince Narumov.
What's the matter with you tonight?
It's quite all right.
I can see quite well from here.
How hot it is in here. Quite stifling.
Are you feeling unwell?
It's my head. I feel faint. I think I'll go and sit in the foyer for a little while.
Yes, of course. May I escort you?
No, I assure you it's only the heat.
I shall have recovered in a few moments.
I don't think that...
No, I insist, I insist!
That probably accounts for the young baron's insistence.
He's reputed to be uncommonly fond of...
Lizaveta!
Odd to meet you here.
Where else can we meet?
Someone is bound to see us.
I must speak to you.
They'll be looking for me. I have only a moment.
Please.
Listen, Lizaveta.
That was no idle threat in my letter.
If I cannot go on seeing you there is only one solution for me: death.
Death?
Yes, I'd rather die here at your feet than live without you.
Death is nothing to me.
You frighten me when you talk like that.
Oh, then I'll be silent.
Only I beg, don't send away the man to whom the sight of you is all the consolation he has left.
I don't make any demands upon you, but I must, unless I carry out my threats, have leave to see you.
When and where?
I can never leave the house alone.
Promotion?
And how can you get a promotion?
My coat.
How can you get promotion... unless you win the favor of some general?
You stupid boy!
I was only trying to be gay and amusing, Aunt Katya.
Gay and amusing? Don't talk to me about gay and amusing.
You must get away from this life.
You must do as I say.
When do you go out with the countess again?
Tomorrow night to the ball.
Tomorrow?
And what time do you return?
At three.
I'll slip into the house at midnight and wait.
Will there be any servants about?
No. They all retire to sleep awaiting our return.
Help me, Lizaveta. Where can I wait?
Where can I conceal myself?
No. Please forget what I said.
I must be out of my senses.
Lizaveta!
Please let me go now.
I love you.
Do you believe me?
Yes.
Then do as I say.
I intend to find my way inside the house.
I think I'll go and see how she is, Fyodor.
I feel uneasy.
You'll only anger her.
Don't worry, she'll be back before long.
I cross the hall and come right to the servant's staircase.
Yes. The sewing room is at the top.
Wait for me there.
And the countess' bed chamber, you say, is on the first floor beyond the drawing room.
Yes. But be quite sure you don't go that way.
I must go back now.
I'm frightened. Please let us wait.
There's nothing to be frightened of.
And please put a candle on your bedroom window
That way I can know if something has gone wrong.
Where's Captain Suvorin?
His Honor will be back in a minute, Your Excellency.
Andrei!
What a surprise.
I want an explanation from you.
What are your relations with Lizaveta Ivanovna Leodovski?
Come now, no play acting, please.
I saw you together at the Opera House last night.
And since when do I have to explain my actions to you?
What are your intentions towards Lizaveta Ivanovna?
I insist on knowing!
Now what's the reason for this sudden outburst?
Just because you see me with a girl in the foyer of the Opera House?
You're planning a cold-blooded seduction.
Why else should you meet Lizaveta Ivanovna so secretly?
Don't interfere with my plans, you... insolent young puppy.
I'm warning you, Suvorin.
I shall hold you responsible for any ill that may befall her.
What is Lizaveta doing?
Go and find out!
Oh, not both of you!
Oh, go away, go away, go away!
Who is mother's girl?
Yes. Now take care of Angèle... and see that she doesn't get near Vodka.
Where is Vodka?
Where is the dog?
Fedya!
I could be set on my heels on my own door for all my servants care.
Skiovka doesn't like the dog, Your Excellency,
It's always crowding her.
Skiovska is a servant!
Lizaveta Ivanovna!
How much longer am I to be kept waiting?
Have you taken leave of your senses, Liza?
Don't stand there!
What have you been doing?
I'm sorry, Ana Fyodorovna.
I forgot my reticule.
I wonder. Do you think I might be excused from coming to the ball?
Oh, what is it now?
Another of those swooning fits you had at the opera last night?
And what are those flowers in your hair?
Modesty of demeanor is all that is required of you.
Come now.
They've been waiting for me at the ball this half hour.
Hurry up!
Don't leave us here all night.
Excuse me, Countess!
I don't want to disturb her.
General Volkoninov, Countess.
What's that?
General Volkoninov.
I know perfectly well who it is, thank you.
There's no occasion to shout at me.
Well, General, I trust you're enjoying good health.
Splendid! Splendid!
And you?
Excellent! Excellent!
Capital.
Prince Narumov, Countess.
Hm?
Oh, Narumov.
And how is my old friend your mother?
She's in excellent health, Countess.
She sends you her regards.
Capital, capital.
I've come to beg the honor of a dance with Lizaveta Ivanovna, Countess.
That's unfortunate. She's not in very good health.
She's not feeling very well tonight.
Oh, yes I am, Countess.
Will you excuse me?
No, no. That's impossible.
I cannot be left sitting by myself.
I expect Princess Ivashin to join me later.
Perhaps then Lizaveta will be well enough to dance.
Lizaveta Ivanovna, are you doing everything in your power deliberately to try and provoke me?
All this evening you've been complaining of feeling ill and faint and begging me to let you go home.
Next instant you're ready to dance about with the first person who chooses to ask you.
Why did you call me here tonight?
I knew it.
You knew what?
You wouldn't get to dance.
Why?
You don't know my grandmother.
She hates being left alone.
She always gets her own way.
Yes, and she's the most exasperating...
Andrei, she's an old woman and she's afraid of death.
Mind you, she's got far too much courage ever to show it to anybody.
Lizaveta, is it cold in here?
Cold? No, I don't think so.
Put my shawl around me.
I feel cold.
Vodka! Come back!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please take your partners for the mazurka.
Lizaveta Ivanovna, I must speak to you after the dance.
Yes, of course. What about?
It's most important. It's about German Suvorin.
But Lizaveta!
I don't wish to discuss it.
I know nothing of your relations with Suvorin.
Please, I beg you. Do not trust him.
He's dangerous.
You presume too much on a slight acquaintance with me, Prince.
Please, Liza...
Liza, if anything should happen to you,
I'd never forgive myself for failing to warn you.
I'm truly amazed that one officer should try to defame another as you have done to me.
Good night, Prince.
Vassili, are you there?
The countess is back.
Good night, Countess.
German.
There now.
Now you'll sleep tonight.
You must go to bed.
I cannot sleep. I cannot sleep.
Good night, Ana Fyodorovna.
God be with you.
May the power of the Holy Cross protect you.
Holy Virgin, have mercy on me.
Have mercy on me.
Holy Virgin, have mercy on me.
Have mercy on me.
Holy Virgin
Don't cry out! Don't be alarmed!
Please, don't be alarmed
I don't mean to do you any harm.
I've come to ask a favor of you.
That's all.
A favor.
It will cost you nothing.
But to me it will bring happiness... for the rest of my life.
I want the secret of the cards.
That's all.
Come. What is it?
The three cards.
The names of the three cards.
Please.
It's no use pretending you don't know anything about it.
I know you've been given the secret.
And I know who gave it to you.
Please.
Just think those three words aloud.
And I trouble you no more. I go.
What good is the secret to you?
For whom are you keeping it?
For your grandson? He's rich enough.
What would another fortune mean to him?
A waster and a spendthrift.
But I'm not a man of that sort.
I know the value of money.
I could do great things, I tell you.
Great things.
If only I had money.
For the love of God.
If you have any human feeling in your breast you can't refuse me.
I beg... I beseech you.
I know why you won't speak.
The secret is connected with some kind of a sin.
That's it, isn't it?
But I make a bargain with you.
Tell me your secret and I'll take your sin upon my soul.
Do you hear me? I mean it!
A bargain. I'll take your sin upon my own soul.
Speak!
Speak to me, you old thing!
Or by God I will make you.
I ask you for the last time.
Aren't you going to tell me the secret of the cards?
Or are you...
No!
German.
Where have you been?
What is it?
Are you ill?
German, what has happened?
I...
I've been to the countess's room.
Did she see you?
Hm-hmm.
She's dead.
What did you say?
She's dead.
I must go to her.
Do you want us to be discovered?
What are we going to do?
German... what are we going to do?
If only you hadn't taken the passage to the left.
I did it deliberately.
Deliberately?
Share a secret.
I wanted that secret.
I don't understand.
But she died... and took the secret with her.
You wanted her secret?
That was the reason for your rituals... outside my window.
She cheated me.
Your letters... your wonderful letters...
A fortune was within my grasp.
All lies then.
All lies.
And she refused to speak.
Oh, what have I done?
Holy Mother.
What have I done?
She deserved... to die.
Murderer!
No...
No, I never meant to kill her.
It isn't... It's not loaded.
Don't, German. Get out of here.
If you have any sense of decency... spare me your sight.
But it's nearly dawn. The servants will be up.
How will I leave the house?
I don't know.
Use the secret staircase from the countess's room
It leads down to the street.
How do I find it?
It's part of the bookcase.
Press the carving on the sixth shelf.
The key is on the dressing table.
Murderer?
The sixth bookshelf.
The dead shall give up all their secrets.
I am commanded to grant your request.
Three, seven, ace.
I forgive you my death on condition that you marry my ward,
Lizaveta Ivanovna.
Three.
Seven.
Ace.
Three.
Seven.
Ace.
The cards.
The secret.
Your health.
Now would you just mind signing that, please?
Thank you.
Forty-seven thousand rubles. There you are.
And that's quite a fortune.
Yes, and what about a little something for myself?
Oh, and I deserved it.
It wasn't easy realizing all the money on such short a notice.
What are you going to do with it?
Something foolish, I'll be bound.
I know you quiet ones when you decide to break out.
Vodka and gypsy girls.
Here's luck.
I wish I were in your shoes.
Careful, now.
Goodbye, my little one.
My darling.
Think about Varvaruschka sometimes.
Of course I shall think of you, my darling.
We shall never see each other in this life again.
May God bless and keep you and the power of the Holy Cross protect you.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Lizaveta.
Lizaveta Ivanovna.
I have something to tell you.
Please let me pass.
But it's of the utmost importance to you.
Why have you come back to torment me like this?
Not to torment you, Lizaveta.
I've come back to ask your forgiveness.
Forgive me, Lizaveta.
For what you've done to me I forgive you.
But as for the countess's death I can never forgive either you or myself.
Lizaveta...
I don't want to listen to you. I'm going away.
No, you can't. You can't.
Lizaveta, listen to me.
Please, please listen to me.
I admit when I first saw you at the window
I made my plans... you were nothing to me, a stranger.
My love was faint.
But it all has changed now.
Don't you see, Lizaveta?
I love you. Yes.
I love you.
And I'm asking you to be my wife.
You're nothing but a murderer to me.
Think of me what you like. Only marry me.
Oh, I see.
You don't want to be the wife of German Suvorin because I'm only a humble captain in engineers.
Don't you make a mistake.
It will all be different tomorrow.
For tonight I shall come into a vast fortune.
I despise you.
You fool.
Still you are then... a paid companion, a drudge.
But you'll come crawling tomorrow,
I tell you.
With all the rest of them.
All these people in St. Petersburg begging for admission to my house.
And I'll let you crawl.
All of you.
And I'll remember my sufferings, my humiliation... and I'll step on you.
Liza, what's happened? There, calm yourself.
He's mad. I'm sure he is. Suvorin.
German Suvorin.
No, no. Stay with me!
Don't go, Andrei!
Andrei! Andrei!
He's gone.
Liza.
Liza, you can't leave like this.
Let me take you to my parents' house.
I wish only for your happiness, you know that.
I must tell you.
I cannot keep it to myself any longer.
He killed the countess.
He threatened her with a pistol and she died of fright.
It's my fault. I...
I'm sorry I wouldn't listen to you.
Liza...
Liza, I'll take care of you. if you let me...
But Suvorin...
Don't worry about him.
I promise you he will never trouble you again.
Oh, take care, Andrei.
Please.
He's evil.
It was like looking into the eyes of Satan.
Maruschka! German!
I'll make you pay for this!
Prince Narumov!
You may choose your weapons.
I shall.
But I make one condition.
Yes?
That you play a hand of faro with me tonight.
He wants to play.
That's a sporty offer.
Accept, accept, Andrei Andreievich.
I accept.
I'll take the bank.
How much?
Forty-seven thousand rubles.
But nobody here has ever staked more than 250 rubles at a time.
You accept?
Oh, yes, yes. I accept.
But I must ask you to put your money on the table.
Forty-seven thousand.
I was not prepared to play on such a scale tonight.
I must ask you to accept my note of hand.
Very well.
Forty-seven thousand rubles.
"Three".
Your win.

The ace wins.
Your queen has lost.

...be content as I am.
Take life as it comes.
I'd rather take it by the throat and force it to give me what I want.
Three, seven, ace.
The Queen has lost!
Three, seven, ace.
Your Queen has lost!
I shall come into a vast fortune.
Fortune or lose your precious soul.
I shall come into a vast fortune.
Fortune or lose your precious soul.

Uh...
Thank you.
You won't believe this.
You've probably heard it a dozen times before.
- But I've never known any artists.
- I'm not an artist.
Oh. What's all this?
- I do sketches for fashion drawing.
- Oh.
- May I see it?
- Oh, no. It's not good.
If I let you see it, you might not want to know any artists ever.
(CHUCKLES) I'm afraid it'd have to be pretty bad to do that.
Besides, look... "Let no one say and say it to your shame..."
## (CONTINUES)
Irena Dubrovna. Is that a Russian name?
- No. I'm from Serbia.
- Oh, I see.
Would you mind spelling it?
Want to know how to spell my name?
Are you going to write me a letter?
- I'd like to write you a letter.
- What about?
I would say in this letter,
"Dear Miss Dubrovna..."
I would say, "Will you have tea with me?"
Oh. Well, in that case I'd just have to write you another letter.
- I'd say...
- Here's my house.
Perhaps, Mr. Reed, you would like to have tea in my apartment?
Oh, Miss Dubrovna.
You make life so simple.
You know,
I never cease to marvel at what lies behind a brownstone front.
- Well, what's the matter?
- Nothing.
But you... you looked at me in such a funny way.
I have never had anyone here.
You're the first friend I met in America.
Oh, I know lots of people in business.
Editors, secretaries, other sketch artists, you know.
But you might be my first real friend.
Thank you.
- Nice.
- That's Lalage.
- Lalage?
- The perfume I use.
I like it. Perhaps too well.
Maybe I use too much of it, living alone like this.
It's hard to describe.
Not like flowers, exactly. It's...
It's like something warm and living.
## (IRENA HUMMING)

- (ANIMALS GROWLING, SNARLING)
- What's that?
It's the lions in the zoo.
One can hear them here often.
Many people in this building complain.
The roaring keeps them awake.
- And you don't mind it?
- No.
To me, it's the way the sound of the sea is to others... natural and soothing.
I like it.
Some nights there is another sound... the panther.
It screams like a woman.
I don't like that.
Oh, I hadn't realized how dark it was getting.
I like the dark. It's friendly.
No, no, keep still, please.
- Are you admiring my statue?
- Not exactly.
- Who's it supposed to be?
- King John.
Oh, King John.
The Magna Carta and all that stuff?
No. King John of Serbia.
He was a fine king.
He drove the Mamelukes out of Serbia and freed the people.
Well, why have this around?
Well, perhaps you have in your room a picture of George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.
(CHUCKLES) Well, what does it mean?
Why is he... Why is he spearing that cat?
Oh, it's not really a cat.
It's meant to represent the evil ways into which my village had once fallen.
You see, the Mamelukes came to Serbia long ago and they made the people slaves.
Well, at first, the people were good and worshipped God in a true Christian way.
But, uh, little by little, the people changed.
When King John drove out the Mamelukes and came to our village, he found dreadful things.
People bowed down to Satan and said their masses to him.
They had become witches and were evil.
Well, King John put some of them to the sword.
But some, the wisest and the most wicked, escaped into the mountains.
Now do you understand?
Well, I still don't see what it has to do with you.
Those who escaped, the wicked ones, their legend haunts the village where I was born.
Boys who come to tea can't expect to stay to dinner.
Some other time perhaps.
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, what time tomorrow?
Dinner?
A little more to the left, Harry.
Easy. Just a hair.
I'm afraid she's gonna be all right, Alice.
She's got what it takes, all right,
Commodore.
Oh, isn't it a darling?
- Where'd you get it?
- I bought it.
- You're not going in for cats, are you?
- No, Commodore, I just bought it for a friend.
We arrived at the inescapable conclusion that our Oliver has a girl.
A brilliant deduction, Carver.
I want to show you something.
- A girlfriend?
- A girl.
- Anybody I know?
- Not yet, but I know you'll like her.
Well, if you like her, she's okay with me.
- (DOORBELL BUZZES)
- (KITTEN MEWING)
Shh.
- Well, hello.
- (KITTEN MEWS)
Look, Irena. I brought you a present.
Why, you little devil.
Oh, it's all right.
It's just that cats don't seem to like me.
Yeah, but this is only a kitten.
It's very friendly.
When I had it in the office, Alice... that's the girl who works in our department... it played with her.
(CHUCKLES) Cats just don't like me.
Oh, I know what we can do.
- You got it at a pet store, didn't you?
- Yes.
Good. Well, we could exchange it for some other pet.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll get my coat.

I'd like to exchange this kitten for a canary.
You'll have to talk louder.
- What did you say?
- I can't understand a word you say.
I can't imagine what...
Oh, landie-dearie me.
I can't imagine what got into them.
All that caterwauling.
The last time they did that was when an alley cat got in and ate up one of my nice Rice finches.
- I wanted to exchange this kitten for a bird.
- Why, of course.
I have some lovely canaries.
One little lemon-colored fellow with top notes like Caruso.
As peaceful as my dream of heaven.
Shall we go back now and select just which little birdie?
You go, please, Oliver.
You pick the one you like.
I'd rather stay here.
Of course. I'll only be a minute.
Animals are ever so psychic.
There are some people who just can't come in here.
My dear brother's wife, for instance.
She's a very nice girl.
I have nothing against her.
But you just should see what happens when she puts her foot inside this place.
The cats particularly, they seem to know.
You can fool everybody, but landie-dearie me, you can't fool a cat.
They seem to know who's not right, if you know what I mean.
Here we are.
Isn't he a ducky little angel?
- This is it.
- Thank you.
- What do you think of it?
- Oh, he is sweet.
He will like me very much.
You will see. I like to be liked.
That ought to be easy. Really easy.
- Irena.
- Yes.
- I fell asleep.
- I know.
Couldn't have been very entertaining for you.
I was watching you.
- And that was fun?
- Mm-hmm.
Do you love me, Irena?
Mm-hmm.
You know I love you, don't you?
I've never kissed you.
Do you know, that's funny.
Why?
Well... when people in America are in love, or even think they're in love, they've usually kissed long ago.
Well?
Irena, what's wrong?
I've lived in dread of this moment.
I've never wanted to love you.
I've stayed away from people, I...
I lived alone.
I never wanted this to happen.
- But you just told me you love me.
- I do.
I do.
I've fled from the past, from things you could never know or understand.
Evil things.
Evil.
Irena, you've told me something of the past... about King John and the witches in the village and the cat people descended from them.
They're fairy tales, Irena.
Fairy tales heard in your childhood.
Nothing more than that.
They've nothing to do with you, really.
You're Irena. You're here in America.
You're so normal, you're even in love with me,
Oliver Reed, a good, plain Americano.
You're so normal, you're gonna marry me.
And those fairy tales, you can tell them to our children.
They'll love them.

It's all right. It's all right.
When do we get some more, eh?
- Oh, here it comes.
- Ah.
- ## (CONTINUES)
- Aha! Komitadji!
Oh, Mr. Carver, you should not call a good man that.
But it's Serbian.
I got it from my barber this afternoon.
But you might insult him.
Komitadji means "thief," "bandit."
I've been double-crossed.
Oliver's bride seems to be a very nice girl.
And a very pretty one too.
Carver tells me she's a bit odd.
He's worried about the marriage.
Nonsense. Irena's a grand girl.
She and Oliver are going to be very happy together.
I certainly hope so.
## (ENDS)
- To the bride.
- The bride!
- (GUESTS) The bride! The bride!
- (GUESTS LAUGHING)
Look at that woman. Isn't she something?
Looks like a cat.
Thank you so much for this lovely party, Alice.
I didn't know there was a Serbian restaurant.
Anything you want to know about this city, ask me.
- I know all the unimportant details.
- (IRENA LAUGHS)
Moja sestra.
Moja sestra?
## (STRINGS: NEW SONG)
- (ALL CHATTERING)
- Well, how do you like that?
What did that woman say to you, darling?
Well, what did she say?
Wait a minute. It can't be that serious, just one single word.
She greeted me.
She called me "sister."
You saw her, Oliver.
You saw what she looked like.
Oh, the cat people.
She looks like a cat, so she must be one of the cat people, one of King John's pets.
(CHUCKLING) Oh, Irena, you crazy kid.
I know a joke about weddings.
Why would my wedding be a dollar-and-cents wedding, eh?
All right, why?
Because I haven't a dollar, and me girl hasn't any sense.
That's a corny joke even for you, Doc.
- (CARVER, IRENA LAUGHING)
- Come on, Carver.
What is it, darling?
I'm... I'm going to beg.
Mrs. Reed?
It's nice to hear that. Nice.
- I want to be Mrs. Reed.
- Well, you are.
But I want to be Mrs. Reed really.
I want to be everything that name means to me.
And I can't. I can't.
Oliver... be kind, be patient.
Let me have time.
Time to get over that feeling there's something evil in me.
Darling, you can have all the time there is in the world if you want it, and all the patience and kindness there is in me.
Only a little time, Oliver.
I don't want more than that.
OLIVER: Good night, Irena.
Good night, Oliver.
Good night, Irena.

No, he ain't beautiful.
He's an evil critter, ma'am.

- You read your Bible.
In Revelations, where the book's talking about the worst beast of them all, it says,

Like a leopard, but not a leopard.

- (BIRD SQUAWKS)
Would you like some sherry?
If you're determined to mourn that bird, we'll have a regular wake.
It's not just because the bird died.
It's me.
I envy every woman I see on the street.
They can't match your little finger.
I envy them.
They are happy.
They make their husbands happy.
They lead normal, happy lives.
They're free.
- Do you know what happened to the bird?
- It died.
It died of fright when I tried to take it in my hand.
All right, the bird was afraid of you.
That's nothing.
I had a rabbit once that hated me, yet I grew up to be quite a nice fella.
Oliver.
When I went past the panther's cage,
I had to open the box.
I had to throw the bird to him.
Do you understand?
I had to. I had to do it.
That's what frightens me.
Irena, I've been trying to kid you out of it.
Maybe that's wrong. I've tried to...
No one could have been more gentle or more patient.
I've tried to make you realize all these stories that worry you are so much nonsense.
But now I see it's not the stories.
It's the fact that you believe them.
We've got to have help, Irena.
Not that sort of help.
There's something wrong, and we have to face it in an intelligent way.
We don't need a King John with fire and sword.
We need someone who can find the reason for your belief and cure it.
That's what we need.
A psychiatrist.
Oh, find one for me, Oliver.
The best one.
The very best one.
You were saying, the cats...
They torment me.
I wake in the night, and the tread of their feet whispers in my brain.
I have no peace, for they are in me.
PSYCHIATRIST: In me.
In me.
Hypnosis always tires me.
Some of my patients, too, find it exhausting.
It's only that I... I remember nothing.
It's my duty to remember.
I have it all here. Most interesting.
You told me of your village and the people and their strange beliefs.
I'm so ashamed.
It must seem so childish.
And the cat women of your village too.
You told me of them.
Women who, in jealousy or anger or out of their own corrupt passions, can change into great cats, like panthers.
And if one of these women were to fall in love, and if her lover were to kiss her, take her into his embrace, she would be driven by her own evil to kill him.
That's what you believe and fear, isn't it?
These things are very simple to psychiatrists.
You told me about your childhood.
Perhaps we will find this trouble stems from some early experience.
You said you didn't know your father, that he died in some mysterious accident in the forest before your birth.
And because of that, the children teased you and called your mother a witch, a cat woman.
These childhood tragedies are inclined to corrode the soul, to leave a canker in the mind.
But we'll try to repair the damage.
You're not to worry.
What shall I tell my husband?
Naturally, he's anxious to have some word.
What does one tell a husband?
One tells him nothing.
Alice, it's so nice to see you.
Hello, darling.
How'd you make out with Louis?
- Louis?
- Dr. Judd.
Alice knows, darling.
Of course. Didn't I suggest Dr. Judd?
I met him on the commodore's boat.
The way he goes around kissing hands makes me want to spit cotton.
But I guess he knows all there is to know about psychiatry.
- Uh-oh.
- I told Alice.
I knew she'd know some good doctor.
I don't see why that was necessary.
Sorry. I seem to have put my big foot in it.
I'm sorry, Irena.
I'm sure neither Oliver nor I had any notion of offending you.
I'm dreadfully sorry.
Good-bye, Alice.
Darling, really, there's no reason to...
But, Oliver, how can you discuss such things?
Such intimate things about me?
- How much did you tell her?
- You can tell Alice anything.
She's such a good egg.
She can understand anything.
There are some things a woman doesn't want other women to understand.
Irena.
I woke up. You were gone.
What's wrong, darling?
I couldn't sleep. I went out.
- Where'd you go?
- Just walked.
I'm sorry about this afternoon.
I... I just didn't think.
Oliver, we should never quarrel.
Never let me feel jealousy or anger.
Whatever is in me is held in, is kept harmless when I am happy.
I'd turn handsprings, darling.
I'd dance in the streets to make you happy.
Toward the sheer line.
Sixty-two degrees.
Hey.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I must have given you the wrong figure.
Let me try again.
Wait. Let's have a cigarette first.
That's the third wrong figure you've given me this morning.
Getting careless in my old age.
Something's on your mind.
Anything wrong?
Nope.
Must be marriage.
Well, in a way, it is.
I'm worried about Irena.
But I thought she was going to Dr. Judd.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
But I ran into Dr. Judd this morning.
She hasn't been back since the first visit.
But you told me she seemed so anxious to be cured.
Apparently not.
I'm sorry, Ollie.
Must make you very unhappy.
You know, it's a funny thing.
I've never been unhappy before.
Things have always gone swell for me.
I had a grand time as a kid.
Lots of fun at school and here at the office with you and the commodore and Doc.
That's why I don't know what to do about all this.
I've just never been unhappy.
Hey.
Now, wait a minute.
I... can't help it.
I just can't help it.
I can't bear to see you unhappy.
I love you too darn much, and I don't care if you do know it, Ollie.
I love you.
I'm sorry. Forget it.
There's Irena. You're in love with her.
I don't know.
All this trouble has made me think...
I don't know what love really is.
I don't know... even whether
I'm in love with Irena.
I know what love is.
It's understanding.
It's you and me, and let the rest of the world go by.
It's just the two of us living our lives together, happily and proudly.
No self-torture and no doubt.
It's enduring and it's everlasting.
Nothing can change it.
Nothing can change us, Ollie.
That's what I think love is.
Well... that isn't the way I feel about Irena.
It's a different feeling.
I'm drawn to her.
There's a warmth from her that... pulls at me.
I have to watch her when she's in the room.
I have to touch her when she's near.
But I don't really know her.
In many ways, we're strangers.
You and I, we'll never be strangers.

Oh, I'm always forgetting it.
But ain't no worry in it.
Nobody would want to steal one of them critters.
You resist temptation admirably.
- Temptation?
- The, uh, key.
- Why would I want it?
- For many reasons.
There is, in some cases, a psychic need to loose evil upon the world.
And we all of us carry within us a desire for death.
You fear the panther, yet you're drawn to him again and again.
Couldn't you turn to him as an instrument of death?
You didn't come back to see me Friday.
I've had to come to you.
- Well, how did you know where to find me?
- You told me many things.
Why didn't you come back?
I don't feel you can help me.
You're very wise. You know a great deal.
Yet when you speak of the soul, you mean the mind.
And it is not my mind that is troubled.
What a clever girl.
All the psychologists have tried for years to find that subtle difference between mind and soul.
And you found it.
It does seem presumptuous of me, doesn't it?
Good-bye, Doctor.
Irena.
I'm worried. What's happening to us?
I love you, Oliver.
I know, but people can love and people can still drift apart.
And that's what I feel is happening to us.
We don't talk together openly.
You're not frank with me.
I've never lied to you.
I ran into Dr. Judd today.
You haven't been back to see him.
- He cannot help me.
- Well, you won't let him help you.
You won't let me help you.
You won't even help yourself.
It's what I said to Alice this afternoon.
- You're content to go on as we are...
- Alice.
Oh, I...
I promised you we'd never quarrel.
Let's calm down a bit.
I'll go back to the office.
I've got some work to do.
Oh, do you wanna go up to the office, Mr. Reed?
I think I'll go round the corner to Sally Lunn's, get a cup of coffee before I get to work.
I'll be back.
- Hello, Mr. Reed.
- Minnie.
Maybe you'd like some nice chicken gumbo today?
No, thanks, Minnie.
How about some apple pie and a cup of coffee?
Yes, sir.
My goodness, don't nobody like chicken gumbo?
Hello.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
John Paul Jones, don't you hate people who do that?
Good night, John Paul.
Here, Mrs. Agnew, a couple new matchbooks for your collection.
Oh, thank you, Miss Moore.
Ooh. Chartreuse. Ain't that elegant?
Too bad you wasn't here just a minute ago.
- Mr. Reed looked in.
- Oh, where'd he go?
Said he was going around the corner to Sally Lunn's.
- I'll see if I can catch him. Good night.
- Good night, Miss Moore.
Could you squeeze the coffee pot for me, Minnie?
- Hello.
- I sure could.
Only this coffee's been working so long, it's got muscles.
What are you doing in this part of town at this hour of night?
Hmm. Stormy weather.
Ollie, you're going to have to solve your problems your own way.
I'm going to drink up and go home.
I think you'd better go home, too, and make it up with Irena.
Alice, you're very swell.
That's what makes me dangerous.
I'm the new type of other woman.
- Good night, Minnie.
- Good night.
- You cold?
- A cat just walked over my grave.
Don't you want me to walk you home?
No, thanks. I'm a big girl now and I'm not afraid.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Climb on, sister.
Are you riding with me, or ain't you?
You look as if you'd seen a ghost.
Did you see it?
Taxi, lady?
No, please don't. Don't touch me.
Irena.
I'm sorry.
I've been worried to death.
I didn't know where you were.
I thought...
What happened tonight happens in every family.
I was all on edge.
You've got to understand and you've got to forgive me.
I forgive you.
Irena.
What?
Are you all right?
I'm all right.
JUDD: To loose evil upon the world.
There is, in some cases, a psychic need to loose evil upon the world.
There is, in some cases, a psychic need, a desire for death.
To loose evil.
A desire for death.
A psychic need.
The, uh, key.
The, uh, key.
The, uh, key.
The, uh, key.
I'm afraid this is dull for Irena.
Darling, there are some beautiful moderns upstairs.
- Why don't you take a look at them?
- But I like these little boats.
I want to be with you. Don't send me away.
We're not sending you away.
We just don't want you to be bored.
We'll meet you in the main lobby in an hour.
Oh, Ollie, look, a drawing of the Victory.
You know, that's the last man-of-war with a lateen sail aft.
Could I have the key for the swimming pool?
- Of course, dearie.
- Oh, what a darling kitten.
Yeah. It's one of four.
A tabby had 'em about a month ago.
Don't forget to turn the lights out when you're through, will ya?
- I won't forget.
- (PHONE BUZZES)
Hello?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Just a moment, dearie. Yes?
- Is Miss Moore in?
She just went downstairs to the swimming pool.
Would it be all right if I went down to see her?
Of course, dearie.
Right down them steps there.
Ah, gee, I can't tonight.
- (WATER DRIPPING)
- (YOWLS)
- (SNARLING)
- (SCREAMING)
Help!
Help!
- (SCREAMING CONTINUES)
- (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
- Gee whiz, Mrs. Hanson.
- (FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(ECHOING) Help!
What is the matter, Alice?
What bothers Miss Moore?
- Gee whiz, dearie. Are you all right?
- It's nothing.
It was dark down here, and Mrs. Reed coming in unexpectedly frightened me.
I'm terribly sorry.
No, don't go. I'm coming right out.
Sorry to have disturbed you, Alice.
I missed you and Oliver, and I thought you might know where he is.
We waited for you at the museum.
You'll probably find him at home.
If you don't mind then, I'll run on.
- Could I have my robe, please?
- Sure.
Gee whiz, honey. It's torn to ribbons.
Thank you for coming at so late an hour, Dr. Judd.
I phoned you because I'm troubled.
I think you can help me.
How much do you believe about the cat people?
The cat people?
The story Mrs. Reed told me?
Yes.
I believe, my dear Miss Moore, exactly as I told Mrs. Reed...
The story is a product of her own fear, her own overworked imagination.
What would you say, Dr. Judd, if I were to tell you that I believe Irena's story?
Yes?
Twice I've been followed by something that was not human, something that attempted to take my life.
I believe that was the cat form of Irena.
But why should she wish to harm you?
Because I'm in love with her husband.
Oh, my dear Miss Moore.
This story grows more and more charming.
Simpler, too, all the time.
You're both victims of fear.
Mrs. Reed fears the past, and you fear the present.
Mrs. Reed has a very strong imagination, and you have an equally strong conscience.
Dr. Judd, the danger that threatened me was very real.
You disappoint me, Miss Moore.
Here's my robe.
To understand this,
I should first have to hear
Mrs. Reed's version of the story myself.
That should be a most interesting interview.
I shouldn't advise you to see her alone.
Do you think I'm afraid of so charming a lady?
Dr. Judd, I know you don't believe me, but you must be careful.
Oh, you want me to carry some means of protection.
A gun, perhaps, with a silver bullet.
Is that what you mean?
If you are lucky enough to have one.
Hmm.
Of course... this isn't silver.
Good night, Miss Moore.
You say you have lapses of memory for which you cannot account.
They're becoming more frequent, and you're afraid.
Help me.
I can't help you.
You're not truthful with me.
But I am. I've told you everything.
I have not lied to you.
Do you sincerely believe that if your husband were to kiss you, you would change into a cat and rend him to bits?
I don't know. I am only afraid.
And if I were to kiss you?
I only know that I should not like to be kissed by you.
My dear Mrs. Reed, sometimes in my profession, there comes a contest of wills between the doctor and his patient.
Patients are clever. Very clever.
And they can fool the doctor sometimes.
You're very clever.
And perhaps you enjoy this little game you are having with me.
But I shall discover your secret.
Dr. Judd, believe me.
I beg you to believe me.
I have no secret. I told you everything.
I have not lied to you.
I need your help.
I can't help you.
But I can warn you.
These hallucinations approach insanity.
This nonsense about Miss Moore at the park and in the swimming pool... it's a deterioration of the mind, an escape into fantasy.
And it's dangerous.
At this moment,
I could go before a board and have you put away for observation.
You're that close to real insanity.
I can't help you.
You can only help yourself.
You keep going back to the mad legends of your birthplace.
Forget them.
You surround yourself with cat objects, pictures.
Get rid of them. Lead a normal life.
You know, for the first time, you've really helped me.
Maybe it's because you interest me.
Oliver.
I went back to Dr. Judd's office.
I'm no longer afraid.
Believe me, Irena, I'd have been the happiest man in the world if you told me that a little while ago.
But things have changed.
I had to learn, maybe through this marriage of ours.
I didn't want to tell you this, but now, you see, I have to.
I love Alice.
Irena, it's too late.
Too late.
Well, there seems only one decent thing for me to do.
I'll give you a divorce.
- Believe me, it's better this way.
- Better?
Better for whom?
Irena, I...
Speak.
You can't speak.
There's nothing you can say.
There's only silence.
But I love silence.
I love loneliness.
(WHISPERING) And they... they are in me.
Their strength, warmth.
Their softness. Their softness.
Irena, you're talking like an insane woman.
Please go.
I want you to go. Please.
Go.
Go!
Bavarian cream?
Roquefort?
And you get the apple pie.
I have pointed out two alternatives, Mr. Reed...
Either have her put away for observation and restraint or have your marriage annulled.
It's tough for Oliver either way, Doctor.
As a psychiatrist, I should recommend that you have her put away.
As your friend, however, I have much more reasonable advice to offer.
I think you should have your marriage annulled.
In that way, you are free of responsibility.
- You two could marry.
- And if Irena's sent away?
The law is quite explicit.
One cannot divorce an insane person.
If she's not well,
I've got to take care of her.
It's the only right thing, Ollie.
As you will. I'll have the commitment papers drawn up and arrange an interview with Mrs. Reed at her apartment tonight.
Shall we say 6:00?
## (RECORD PLAYER: ORCHESTRA, BALLAD)
Let's not play that.
I don't think Irena's coming.
We've waited an hour and a half.
Perhaps it's useless to wait.
OLIVER: I don't think she intends coming.
She's probably walking in the park.
ALICE: Ollie, let's get back to the office.
We've had a terribly broken-up day.
- There's lots of work to be done.
- Suits me.
Oh, how stupid of me.
I left my walking stick in the apartment.
- Oh, I'll get it for you.
- Oh, no, it's my fault.
Give me the key. I shall only be a moment.
OLIVER: Five and a half.
ALICE: Five and a half.
And... one and three-eighths.
And one and three-eighths.
- There.
- (PHONE RINGING)
I'll get it.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
They hung up on me.
- That's funny.
- What?
It happened once before like that.
The telephone rang, and I answered.
There was someone on the other end of the line.
I could almost hear them listening.
And then there was a little click as they hung up the receiver.
That was the night
I was followed on the transverse.
Ollie... let's get out of here.
I'm afraid.
That was Irena.
I know it was Irena who called.
She could call from downstairs.
She may be on her way up now.
Get your things.
The door's open.
We can see to get out into the hall.
I'll turn out the table lights.
It's shut now.
Just a minute ago, it was open.
It's locked.
Irena.
Irena.
Leave us, Irena!
In the name of God, leave us in peace.
Come on.
Let's go down the stairs.
Don't, Alice. It's gone.
Everything's all right. Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Look.
Irena's perfume.
Strong, sweet.
I need a drink.
## (ORCHESTRA: BALLAD)
- Yes?
- ALICE: Dr. Judd?
Miss Moore.
Yes. We've been trying to get you on the phone, Dr. Judd.
I called your hotel.
Yes, I know.
That's what I want to talk about.
Are you alone?
You'd better leave then.
She may be on her way back now.
But she is dangerous, Dr. Judd.
I warn you.
Hello? Hello, Dr. Judd?
Dr. Judd?
I think Irena just came in.
He hung up on me.
Come on.
We'll get a taxi.
You're late, aren't you?
I kept my appointment.
You see, I've never believed your story.
I am not afraid of you.
I take you in my arms.
So little, so soft.
The warm perfume in your hair.
Your body.
Don't be afraid of me, Irena.
WOMAN: He's dead.
OLD WOMAN: Mr. Reed. Oh, Mr. Reed.
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Reed.
Sue Ellen and I phoned the police just as soon as we heard the racket.
Thank you.
Sue Ellen, you know better than that.
You're not supposed to touch anything until the police get here.
- ALICE: The sword cane.
- OLIVER: Broken. Half of it's gone.
We've got to find her. Come on.
She never lied to us.
Talbot Castle, Mr Larry.
- Welcome home, Larry.
- I'm mighty glad to be here, Father.
Hasn't changed much.
Not in 300 years, except some modern conveniences. Know Paul Montford?
- Sure.
- Just came to say hello. Welcome home.
- We used to snitch apples together.
- Now he's chief constable.
And I've got to get to work.
See you tonight about nine, Sir John.
- Glad to have you back, Larry.
- Thanks. Bye-bye.
- So, old Paul turned out to be a cop, huh?
- Cop?
- Yeah. A cop, policeman, you know.
- He's Captain Montford. Retired.
Father.
I'm sorry about John.
Your brother's death was a blow to all of us.
Sit down, won't you?
You know, Larry, there has developed a tradition about the Talbot sons.
The elder, next in line of succession, is considered in everything.
The younger frequently resents his position and leaves home, just as you did.
- Yes. But, Father, I'm here now.
- Fortunately.
But isn't it sad it took a hunting accident and your brother's death to bring you?
It isn't as bad as it sounds.
I watched every bit of news about you.
I was mighty proud when you won the prize for research.
The whole business is probably my fault.
The tradition also insists the Talbots be the stiff-necked, undemonstrative type.
Frequently this has been carried to unhappy extremes.
Don't I know that!
Larry, let's decide, you and I, that between us there shall be no more such reserve.
- I'll do everything that I can, sir.
- That should be considerable.
The 18 years you've been away should've qualified you to be of benefit to the estate, since in a great many ways we are a backward people, but don't quote me.
- What have you got?
- It's from London, sir.
I think it's the new part for the telescope.
Oh, of course. Come along, Larry.
Come on. Up to the attic.
It's an observatory now.
There you are, sir. I think that has it.
I'll have a look at it.
It's excellent. Where'd you learn such precision work?
Optical company in California.
We did quite a job on that Mount Wilson Observatory.
- Are you interested in astronomy?
- Not especially.
I'm all right with tools. I've done quite a little work with astronomical instruments, but when it comes to theory
I'm pretty much of an amateur.
All astronomers are amateurs.
When it comes to the heavens, there's only one professional.
Fine.
Well, I've got some things to do before lunch. I'll leave you to it.
Good afternoon, sir. May I help you?
Why, yes. I'm looking for a gift.
Something in earrings.
Certainly. We have some very nice ones.
There's these diamond ones.
They're very smart.
- Or how about these pearl ones?
- No, I don't think any of those will do.
What I'm really looking for is something half-moon shaped with spangles on it.
- Golden.
- Sorry. We haven't any like that just now.
Oh, yes, you have. Don't you remember?
On your dressing table up in your room.
- In my room?
- Yes.
- Would you mind getting them for me?
- Well... but... they're not for sale.
Well, I can't say that I blame you.
They look so well on you.
Well, perhaps my father can help you.
- I'll call him.
- That won't be necessary.
As long as I can't have the earrings, perhaps I'll buy a cane, huh?
Tell me, how did you know about the earrings in my room?
I'm psychic. Every time I see a beautiful girl, I know all about her, just like that.
Oh.
Well, what kind of cane would you like?
We have day wear or evening wear.
It doesn't matter.
There's this one that's very smart.
Solid-gold top.
No, I don't think that'll do.
Well, how about the little dog?
That would suit you.
No, thanks.
Well, here's one.
- Make a good putter.
- Yes, it would.
That's funny. Another dog.
No, that's a wolf.
- A wolf?
- Mm-hm.
A wolf and a star.
- What does that mean?
- I thought you said you were psychic.
I am, but this is only wood and silver, and it hasn't blue eyes.
- Well, that stick is priced at three pounds.
- Three pounds? $15 for an old stick?
That's a rare piece. It shows the wolf and the pentagram - the sign of the werewolf.
Werewolf? What's that?
That's a human being who at certain times of the year changes into a wolf.
You mean runs around on all fours and bites and snaps and bays at the moon?
Oh, even worse than that sometimes.
"What big eyes you have, Grandma. "
Little Red Riding Hood was a werewolf story.
Of course, there have been many others.
There's an old poem:
"Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night,
May become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright. "
Yes, but what's this pentagram business?
Every werewolf is marked with it and sees it in the palm of his next victim's hand.
Look, lady, if you're trying to scare me outta here, you're not getting very far.
I'll take the cane.
Please tell me.
Have you ever seen me before?
Of course. How do you suppose
I knew about the earrings?
- I can't remember ever...
- Tell you what we'll do.
We'll take a little walk tonight and we'll talk it over.
No.
- See you at eight.
- No.
- Gypsies, huh?
- Yes. They're fortune-tellers.
They pass through here every autumn.
You know, I haven't had my fortune told in years. How about tonight?
No.
Fine. I'll be here at eight.
- Yes, that's the sign of the werewolf.
- That's just a legend though, isn't it?
Yes, but like most legends it must have some basis in fact.
It's probably an ancient explanation of the dual personality in each of us.
How does it go?
"Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night,
May become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright. "
That's funny. That's the same thing the girl in the antique shop said.
Oh, you've met Gwen Conliffe, have you?
So that's her name.
- Uh, I was just looking the town over.
- Naturally.
Continue to look it over.
I want you to know not only the girls, but the old men and women and young men.
Get to know about them.
They're nice people.
They're your people.
After all, you're going to run the estate.
Of course, I wanna know all of them.
You seem to have made a pretty good start.
Run along. Get on with the good work.
All right. Thanks. Good night.
Good night.
Oh!
- It's you.
- Why, of course.
- Who did you expect?
- Why, nobody.
I told you I couldn't go out with you.
And yet you wore those earrings that I like.
- That was just because I...
- Oh, come on. I don't wanna go alone.
I'm really afraid of the dark.
And, you see, I wore my cane, too.
Jenny.
This is Jenny Williams.
She wants to have her fortune told, too.
- I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr...
- Just call me Larry.
If you don't mind... Larry.
Well...
Oh, look!
Oh, wolfbane.
Mm.
"Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night,
May become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright. "
- So you know that one, too, huh?
- Of course.
Everyone knows about werewolves.
We've come to have our fortunes told.
Can you really read the future?
I will not disappoint you, my lady.
- Will you step inside, please?
- Do you mind if I go in first?
No, no. Go right ahead.
Go on, silly.
Quite a pipe the old boy's got, isn't it?
Cut the cards.
We didn't come down to listen in on Jenny, did we?
No.
Well, maybe if you took a little walk with me, I could tell your fortune.
- So you're a fortune-teller?
- Uh-huh.
- Is it how you knew about the earrings?
- Well, not exactly.
A telescope has a mighty sharp eye.
It brings the stars so close you feel you can touch them.
- A telescope?
- Sure.
It does the same to people in their rooms, if you point it in the right direction.
- Oh, you wouldn't.
- Well, I was only testing the refractor.
I didn't know about you, and all of a sudden there you were.
From now on I'll be sure to draw the curtains.
Oh, don't do that.
I mean, not on account of me. I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.
Yes, I'm afraid I do.
But it's only fair to tell you I'm engaged.
I'm going to be married very soon.
- In fact, I really shouldn't be here.
- Oh, but you are here.
Can you tell me when I'm going to be married?
What did you see?
Your hands, please?
Your left hand shows your past.
Your right hand shows your future.
What's the matter?
I can't tell you anything tonight.
Come back tomorrow.
What did you see? Something evil?
No, no. Now go away.
Go quickly!
- Go!
- Yes!
Yes, I'm going!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
I've never heard anything like it before.
Stay here.
Larry!
Wait! Larry!
Larry, where are you?
Oh, Larry. Larry, what happened?
What's the matter?
A wolf.
Help! Help!
Oh, please, hurry.
Hurry, please.
- What happened to him?
- A wolf bit him.
Do something. Can't you help him?
We must take him home.
- Big boy, isn't he?
- Huge.
- Like the Red Talbot.
- Should have had him in the Guards.
Oh, no! He'll be invaluable here looking after the estate.
He's had a lot of experience in America.
Here, here, what's the matter?
Sir John!
- What happened?
- He was bitten by a wolf.
- A wolf?
- There haven't been wolves for years.
- Where?
- By the marsh. That woman came to help.
- Where is she?
- Who?
The Gypsy. I'd not have got him here without her.
- The old woman who was in the doorway.
- Find her.
- Was there anyone else with you?
- Jenny. Someone get Jenny.
- Sir John! Captain! By the marsh.
- Yes, yes, by the marsh?
- Speak up, man.
- Jenny. Jenny Williams.
- What about her?
- She's been murdered, sir.
Wolf, Gypsy, murder! What is this?
- What makes you say she was murdered?
- Her throat, sir.
Let's look into this.
Show me where it happened.
- I'll send Dr Lloyd, Sir John.
- Roberts, give me a hand with Larry.
Get him up to his room.
- Mr Twiddle.
- Yes, sir?
- Take a note, Twiddle.
- Very good, sir.
Jenny Williams attacked by some large animal. That right, Dr Lloyd?
Her jugular was severed by the bite of powerful teeth.
Cause of death: internal haemorrhage.
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm a little squeamish, sir.
- Don't be. Write down what I told you.
- Very well, sir.
Captain Montford! Here, sir.
It's the Gypsy who passed through town this afternoon.
Was he killed by the same animal, Dr Lloyd?
No. His skull was crushed by heavy blows with a sharp instrument.
Take a note, Twiddle: Bela the Gypsy found dead near body of Jenny Williams.
Cause of death: heavy blows from sharp instrument.
- Look. His feet are bare.
- So they are.
Otherwise he's fully dressed.
Make a note of that.
- Very well, sir.
- What's this?
Ooh!
- A stick with a horse's-head handle.
- It's not a horse's head. It's a wolf's head.
Mr Frank, them tracks back there - a wolf!
- Take a note.
- Very well, sir.
Found on scene of tragedy: silver-handled stick mounted with a wolf's head.
Let's have a look at those tracks.
Larry, shouldn't you be in your bed?
- Well, no. I'm all right.
- Good morning, Larry.
- This is Dr Lloyd.
- You frightened us last night, my boy.
I'm sorry. I guess I did kind of pass out.
Is this your stick?
Why, of course.
That's the one I killed the wolf with.
Larry, Bela the Gypsy was killed last night.
They found your stick by the body.
You mean... Bela the fortune-teller?
Mm-hm.
Well...
I only saw a wolf.
He bit me. Look here.
Well... that's funny.
It must have healed up.
Larry, Paul wants to ask you some questions.
- Why, sure. Go ahead.
- No, we ought to leave him alone.
What's the matter with you?
Paul wants to question him. Go ahead.
Yeah, but don't try to make me believe
I killed a man when I know I killed a wolf.
Yes, yes. We're all a little bit confused.
He needs a good rest.
We'll talk to you later, Larry.
Come on, Doctor.
Coming, Sir John?
Yeah, I'll be down in a minute.
Larry, stop worrying and let me handle this.
But they're treating me like I was crazy!
I'm not accusing him of foul play, but two people are dead and I am chief constable.
No reason to make a mystery out of it.
You talk like a detective in a novel.
Please, gentlemen, there's a simple explanation.
A dog or a wolf attacked Jenny Williams.
She cried for help,
Larry and Bela went to her rescue.
It was dark. Excitement and confusion, the Gypsy was killed.
- What about Bela's bare feet?
- He didn't have time to put his shoes on.
- This nonexistent wound?
- Larry imagined he was bitten.
- The beast tore his coat to shreds.
- Still he insists he received a wound.
You tell me his coat was bloody.
Surely a wound can't heal overnight.
The patient is mentally disturbed.
Perhaps the shock did it.
I'd rather you didn't bother him with questions just now.
You policemen, always in such a hurry.
As if dead men hadn't all eternity.
You'll be declaring me a mental case next.
Oh, no, I wouldn't dare.
Thank you. In return, I won't question your patient again until you think fit.
Thank you.
- It's the Gypsy fortune-teller.
- And the man that killed him.
My dear woman, we can't bury this man without prayer.
There is nothing to pray for, sir. Bela has entered a much better world than this.
At least so you ministers always say, sir.
And so it is. But that's no reason to hold a pagan celebration.
I hear your people are coming to town dancing and singing and making merry.
For a thousand years we Gypsies have buried our dead like that.
I couldn't break the custom, even if I wanted to.
Fighting against superstition is as hard as fighting against Satan himself.
The way you walked was thorny, through no fault of your own.
But as the rain enters the soil, the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end.
Your suffering is over, Bela, my son.
Now you will find peace.
But, my dear, there's nothing they can accuse you of.
Now, here, why don't you go up to your room and lie down?
I don't want to be alone, Father.
As soon as I close my eyes, I see Jenny.
I'd rather stay here.
Why, of course, my dear. Of course.
- Ladies, what can I do for you?
- Where is she?
- What do you want to know?
- Why she left my Jenny with the Gypsy.
She didn't want to be there while the fortune was told.
What a lie. She just wanted to walk out in the...
- You mustn't speak of my Gwen like that!
- Listen. There's a fine father for you.
How dare you let her walk out with other men when she's engaged?
- She didn't do anything wrong.
- It's because of her my Jenny was killed.
- Now, that's enough!
- She's to blame.
- I knew that innocent face was just...
- Outside! Outside, all of you!
I want the truth. What was she doing while my little Jenny was being murdered?
- I'll tell you what she was doing!
- All right, tell me!
Come on, come on.
Speak up. What was it?
Don't you dare touch me.
You and your fine daughter.
You've not heard the last of this!
- What's gotten into them?
- I really don't know.
I'm sorry, sir, about getting Gwen into this mess, but there wasn't anything wrong.
I trust my daughter, sir.
I hope that she didn't hear all this row.
- Tell me, is she in?
- Yes, she's in the parlour.
- May I see her, please?
- Why, of course.
Thank you.
Larry!
Oh, you... You heard them.
Yes.
I suppose you can't blame them too much.
Kind of a mess, isn't it?
I came over to tell you how sorry I am about Jenny.
Tell me, just exactly what did happen?
Well, I saw a wolf attacking her and I killed it.
In the fight it bit me. This morning there's no sign of the wound.
Now they're trying to make me believe that I killed Bela the fortune-teller.
Well, maybe there wasn't a wolf.
It was dark and foggy and, well, perhaps the story I told you about the werewolf confused you.
Why does everyone insist that I'm confused?
- Hello, Frank.
- Mr Conliffe. Is Gwen in?
Yes, but she has a visitor.
- Larry Talbot?
- Yes.
Well, that's all right. I want to see him, too.
Larry, this is Frank Andrews.
Quiet.
You'd better take him outside, Frank.
All right. Come on, come on.
- So that's him, huh?
- Yes. We grew up together.
He looks like a nice enough chap.
What does he do?
He's the gamekeeper for your father's estate.
Oh.
Glad to know you, Andrews.
I just came over to see that Gwen was all right.
I guess I'd better be going now.
Goodbye, Gwen.
Goodbye.
Frank, why were you so rude?
Well, I'm sorry, but I couldn't take my eyes off that walking stick of his.
- Gwen, be careful, will you?
- Careful?
Yes. He's been away for 18 years, I know, but he's still the son of Sir John Talbot.
Oh, I see. And I'm the daughter of Conliffe who owns the antique shop. Is that it?
Yes. That and...
Well, there's something very tragic about that man.
And I'm sure that nothing but harm will come to you through him.
Aren't you glad I brought you?
There's Larry Talbot.
Let's go and say hello, eh?
I just wanted to show you that I'm not jealous.
Larry Talbot!
Saw you by yourself.
Thought you might like to join us.
- Thanks. I was just on my way home.
- Don't say that. We'll have fun together.
- Please do, Larry.
- Two guns, please.
Yes, sir.
- See what you can do.
- All right.
He seems to be able to handle a rifle.
Go ahead and shoot before he bites you.
Bad luck.
See? Nothing to it.
Care to try another one?
No, thanks. You win.
He's unstrung.
Long trip. That unfortunate accident the other night.
- You've been a long while coming.
- I'm not buying anything.
And I am not selling anything.
I expected you sooner.
Oh, I remember you.
That night. And in the crypt.
Go inside.
- You killed the wolf.
- Well, there's no crime in that, is there?
The wolf was Bela.
You think I don't know the difference between a wolf and a man?
Bela became a wolf and you killed him.
A werewolf can be killed only with a silver bullet or a silver knife.
Or a stick with a silver handle.
You're insane. I tell you, I killed a wolf.
A plain, ordinary wolf!
Take this charm.
The pentagram - the sign of the wolf.
It can break the evil spell.
Evil spell, pentagram, wolfbane! I'm sick of the whole thing. I'm getting out of here!
Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and lives becomes a werewolf himself.
Quit handing me that.
You're just wasting your time.
The wolf bit you, didn't he?
Yeah. Yeah, he did.
Wear this charm over your heart always.
- I'll take it. What's it worth to you?
- Do you dare to show me the wound?
- What?
- Do you dare to show me the wound?
Go now, and heaven help you.
- Oh, Larry.
- Gwen.
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.
I thought you left with Frank.
Oh, we had a quarrel and I...
Well, I'll take you home, then.
We better go this way.
- Quite a hectic night, wasn't it?
- Yes.
What's that?
Oh, that?
That's a charm.
I just saw the old Gypsy woman.
- They give quite a sales talk, don't they?
- Let me see.
The pentagram.
Yes.
She said that I was a werewolf.
Oh, but surely... you don't believe that...
Gwen, I won't need this.
I want you to have it.
It'll protect you.
Protect me?
- From whom?
- Me.
Just in case.
I never accept a present without giving something in return.
Here's a penny.
That isn't enough.
- Why, the Gypsies are all leaving.
- I must go, too!
But, Gwen!
- Hey, hey, hey. What's all the excitement?
- There's a werewolf in the camp!
- Did you hear that, Mr Twiddle?
- Of course I did.
Otherwise I'd be snug and warm in bed.
- Sounded like a wild animal.
- Might be a beast the Gypsies left behind.
It seemed to come from the churchyard.
- Don't stand talking. Let's go and see.
- Very well. Let us go and have a look.
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Morning.
- Morning, Captain.
- It could be a better one, Doctor.
- Morning, Twiddle.
- Morning, Doctor.
- Richardson, eh?
- Yes.
Severed jugular.
Isn't that the way
Jenny Williams was killed?
Yes.
- Find something?
- Animal tracks.
A wolf.
Morning, Larry.
You're up early.
Why, yes. I heard people in the corridor.
Is there anything wrong?
Richardson was killed last night.
The gravedigger.
The tracks lead up to this house.
- Footprints?
- No, animal tracks. A wolf.
A wolf? Where do you suppose a wolf came from?
He might have escaped from a circus or a zoo.
What is this story about a man turning into a wolf?
- You mean the werewolf?
- Yes, sir.
It's a legend. You'll find something like it in the folklore of nearly every nation.
The scientific name for it is lycanthropia.
It's a variety of schizophrenia.
- That's all Greek to me.
- Well, it is Greek.
It's a technical expression for something very simple.
The good and evil in every man's soul.
In this case, evil takes the shape of an animal.
I can figure out most anything if you give me electric current, tubes and wires - something I can do with my hands.
- But these things you can't even touch!
- What's the matter with you, Larry?
Well, nothing, sir.
But do you believe in these yarns?
Larry, to some people, life is very simple.
They decide that this is good, that is bad.
This is wrong, that's right.
There's no right in wrong, no good in bad.
No shadings and greys, all blacks and whites.
- That'd be Paul Montford.
- Exactly.
Others of us find that good, bad, right, wrong, are many-sided, complex things.
We try to see every side, but the more we see, the less sure we are.
Now, you asked me if I believe a man can become a wolf.
If you mean "Can it take on physical traits of an animal?" No, it's fantastic.
However, I do believe that most anything can happen to a man in his own mind.
Time for church.
You know, Larry, belief in the hereafter is a very healthy counterbalance to all the conflicting doubts man is plagued with these days. Come on.
- Last night it got Richardson.
- Many's the grave he dug for others.
- Now they're digging one for him.
- I daren't go out for fear of that beast.
That beast? Has anybody ever seen it?
I don't think it even exists.
Strange there were no murders here before Larry Talbot arrived.
Hold your tongue, Mrs Williams.
D'you know that's slander?
I know what I know. You should have seen how he looked at me in Conliffe's shop.
Like a wild animal with murder in his eyes.
Sh! Here he comes.
- Morning.
- A pleasure to see you, Sir John.
- How are you, Larry?
- Fine, thank you.
- Miss Conliffe.
- Come, my dear.
I'll send this cast of the animal's tracks to Scotland Yard.
They'll laugh.
There's no question it's a wolf.
Probably hiding in the woods.
What about traps?
We must do something before the town gets hysterical.
Yes, this muttering of werewolves.
Come along. We're discussing this wolf that seems to be roaming the countryside.
Yes. You saw him.
What's he like? Is he a big fella?
- It isn't a wolf.
- What do you mean?
It's a werewolf.
Werewolf?
Maybe he's right.
Let's have a hunt and drive it out.
A valuable addition to anybody's collection.
Imagine having a stuffed werewolf staring at you from the wall.
I wouldn't joke about it, Paul.
Doctor, do you believe in werewolves?
I believe that a man lost in the mazes of his mind may imagine that he's anything.
Science has many examples of the mind's power over the body.
Case of the stigmata appearing in the skin of zealots.
Self-hypnotism.
But if a man isn't even thinking about the thing, isn't interested in it, then how could he hypnotise himself with it?
It might be a case of mental suggestion, plus mass hypnotism.
You mean by that that he could be influenced by the people about him?
Yes.
You're letting your science run away with your common sense.
Have you ever met a werewolf, Doctor?
Not that I know of.
Doctor, can these sick people be cured?
Not they. An asylum's the only safe place for them.
Any disease of the mind can be cured with the cooperation of the patient.
While you men figure it out scientifically,
I'll go and set a few traps.
I'll help. We may not find anything more than a diseased mind, but even that may be interesting.
- Doctor, I've got to talk to you.
- Later. Now I want you to get some rest.
Go on, Larry.
- You're the one I want to talk to.
- I didn't like what you said to him.
Sir John, your son is a sick man.
He's received a shock that has caused psychic maladjustment.
- You must send him away.
- You're talking like a witch doctor.
If my son is ill, the best place for him is here, proving his innocence.
Does the prestige of your family name mean more than your son?
Nonsense. The way for him to get cured is to stay here and fight his way out of this.
And I tell you that shock therapy is too strong for him at present.
Listen to me. Five generations of Talbots haven't been affected by this village.
- That boy stays here!
- Oh, very well.
We'll see how he is in the morning.
- All right, sir.
- Last one, huh?
That ought to hold him.
- They've lost the trail, sir.
- He can't have disappeared into thin air.
Take Phillips and work around the marsh.
See if you can pick up the trail there.
The way you walk is thorny, through no fault of your own.
But as the rain enters the soil, the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end.
Find peace for a moment, my son.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to help you.
- Where am I? What happened?
- You are caught in the trap.
Here, here. Let me do that.
Hurry! The dogs, they are hunting you.
Hello, there. Stop!
Come here! You!
- It's Master Larry.
- What are you doing here, sir?
Why, the same thing that you are, of course. Hunting.
- I hear you talking to someone?
- It was Master Larry.
All right. Go along.
- Who was that?
- Larry Talbot.
Larry.
Gwen, I'm going away.
Away? But why?
I gotta go. I can't stay here any longer.
Let me go with you. I'll fetch a few things and be back in a minute.
No, no. I'm going alone.
But I can help you.
You wouldn't want to run away with a murderer.
Larry, you're not. You know you're not.
I killed Bela. I killed Richardson.
If I stay around here much longer, you can't tell who's gonna be next.
Wait.
- It... might even...
- Please.
I've still got the charm you gave me. Remember?
Yeah, yeah, I know, but I'm afraid.
Larry, what is it?
Your hand!
- Can't see anything.
- Mr Talbot.
Father, I'm going with Larry.
No! It's no use!
Going out, Larry?
Father, I've gotta get away from here.
Bela the Gypsy was a werewolf.
I killed him with that silver cane.
I was bitten.
Look!
The pentagram.
That scar could be made by most any animal.
Yes, but it's the sign of the werewolf.
They say that he can see it in the palm of the hand of his next victim.
That's hard to believe.
I saw it.
- Tonight, in Gwen's hand.
- Larry, Larry.
How can I help you get rid of this fear, this mental quagmire you've got into?
What can I say to you?
You don't understand.
You think I'm insane. Why...
- What's that?
- Paul Montford and the men.
- They're hunting the wolf.
- They're out hunting for me.
Stop it! Stop it!
You can't run away.
That's it.
- That's what she said.
- Who?
The Gypsy woman.
Gypsy woman?
Now we're getting down to it.
She's filled your mind with this gibberish, this talk of werewolves and pentagrams.
You're not a child but a man. And you believe in the superstitions of a Gypsy!
No, but the scar, the footprints in my room!
Look, Father, I was caught in a trap tonight. I don't know how I got there.
The Gypsy woman helped me get away, and now they're all out hunting for me.
Listen to me. You're Laurence Talbot.
This is Talbot Castle.
You believe those men can come in here and take you out?
No.
I'll go out to them.
I can't help myself.
Then I'll see to it that you can't go out to them.
Come on, Larry.
There.
You're fast to the chair.
All the windows are locked.
I'll bolt the door so that nothing can get in or out.
Now you'll see that this evil thing you've conjured up is in your mind.
- Sir John.
- Yes?
Captain Montford and the men are waiting for you and Master Larry.
- I'm coming.
- You're going to stay with me, aren't you?
I've got to go.
These people have a problem.
You must make your own fight, but we'll settle this thing tonight.
- Dad?
- What is it?
Take the cane with you.
- What do I want with a cane?
- Please.
Just take it with you. Please.
All right.
He should come across through there.
The beaters'll drive him right towards this point.
- Did you give your son the sleeping pill?
- Oh, no.
- I wanted him to sleep through all this.
- And I want him cured tonight.
In the morning you'll have proof it was in his mind.
- What did you do?
- Strapped him to the chair.
Turned him to the window so he can see the hunt.
I hope you won't be sorry.
Dr Lloyd.
Coming.
You are not frightened, are you, Sir John?
- Frightened? Of what?
- Of the night.
- Rubbish. You startled me.
- Don't be startled, Sir John.
You have the silver cane for protection.
- Who are you?
- Hasn't your son told you?
You've been filling his mind with this werewolf nonsense.
- Nonsense, Sir John?
- Yes.
Preying on his gullibility with your witches' tales.
But you fixed him, didn't you, Sir John?
- You don't believe witches' tales, do you?
- Not for a minute.
Then where were you going, Sir John?
Why aren't you back there, at the shooting stand?
- I was.
- Were you hurrying back to the castle?
Did you have a moment's doubt? Were you hurrying to make sure he's all right?
I wanted to be with my son.
I was going...
Yes, Sir John? You were going?
Hurry, Sir John. Hurry.
Come around this way, men!
- Swing to the right, come through again.
- White, take charge.
- I could have sworn I hit him dead on.
- And I, too.
Have you forgotten?
It takes a silver bullet for a werewolf.
- Have you seen Larry?
- Don't go in the woods.
- Why?
- Listen. The hunt is on.
- But I want to help him.
- You'd better come with me.
Oh, no! I've got to find him.
Come with me, or he will find you!
Oh.
The way you walked was thorny, through no fault of your own.
But as the rain enters the soil, the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end.
Your suffering is over.
Now you will find peace for eternity.
Down this way, men!
Gwen.
Are you all right?
The wolf must have attacked her and Larry came to the rescue.
I'm sorry, Sir John.
Larry!
BLOOD OF THE BEAST
AT THE DOORS OF PARIS
At the doors of Paris, the uncultivated lands, where young poor men play...
...they are seeded of unique relics of a wealth past.
Arranged and offered for the benefit...
...of peculiar, traveling poets and lovers...
...here, on the brink of madness the life of the city, between trucks and trains.
Im Lager von Vanves ist es das Schlachthaus "Vaugiraud".
In spite of the bullfighting statues,...
...the urban slaughter house is specialized in the slaughter of horses.
To Emile Decroix
Defender of the equine meat
The used tools vary based on the animal: the rush, or cane...
...the mallet...
...and the pistol of retained projectile, whose impact kills the animal right away.
After bleeding, the horse hangs itself to complete the drained one of blood.
Later one loosen to skin it.
Compressed air under the skin is pumped to make the task easier.
The legs are extracted to him.
The hooves will become installment,...
...and the vegetal coal bones...
...become articles of cosmetic.
The delicate task of skinning with one razor to shave sharpened...
...she is not free of danger.
Skinning a horse, Ernest Bruyet sectioned the femoral artery.
The right leg had to be amputated.
This black horse killed Alfred Macquart,...
...possessor of the prestigious "Better Working" diploma of France.
Auguste Macquart, his grandfather,...
...was one of the founders, that packed meat at the beginning of the last century.
To the doors of Paris,...
...the “Channel of l'Ourcq” and the “Wheels of the fortune”.
“Bearing of Pantin”, the market the "Villette”.
A bridge connects the slaughter house with the market...
...for the transfer of cattle.
To the deafening roar of the pneumatic freight elevators,...
...the butchers and the climbers work...
...under the heavy vapor given off by the blood of the beasts.
Maurice Griselle, french boxing ex-champion.
Andre Brunier, one of the best ones using the wooden hammer in the Villette
When inserting the cane in the channel of the medular,...
...it perforates and it destroys the spinal marrow, suppressing therefore the reflections of the animal.
The oppression, completes the drained one of the blood,...
...most of which, gathers in containers.
The channels gather the rest.
This one is gutted while the freight elevator rises.
The fatty surpluses will be gathered by nuns.
Henri Fournel can divide an ox in the time that the clock gives 12:00.
In order to conserve the white calf meat, he beheads the animal to drain all the blood.
The dead animal still shakes, but they are only concerned involuntary.
The heads are marked to identify and to count the cattle.
This is neither a chapel in honor to Babtist San Juan protection patron of the butchers,...
...nor to its tender lamb.
It is the zone of auctions of the slaughter house.
The mother sheeps are guided by the "Traitor".
It knows the way, and its life will be pardoned.
The others follow obediently, bleating...
...like condemned men who still sing knowing that its song is useless.
In order to skin them, the sheep perforate themselves.
During the years, this difficult task can cause a cyst in the wrist.
"I will strike you, without rage and hatred, like a butcher",
...wrote Baudelaire.
Without rage, without hatred,...
...with the placidness of the assassins who whistle or sing while they crack throats,
...because they must gain the bread of every day...
...with the pays of difficult and often a dangerous profession.
The sea that we were present at to dance...
...throughout the radiating bays.
The silver-plated sparkles of the sea,
...reflections alternating in the rain.
The sea...
in the summery sky,
...the plush clouds, sheep,
...they seem like angels back in the height.
The sea,
...shepherd of infinite blue color,
...it observes...
...next to the lagoon, the high and humid rushes;
...it observes...
...the white birds; the rusted houses.
The sea...
The day comes to an end.
In the fold, the sheep, still altered, will remain sleeping in silence.
They will not listen to the closing of the doors of its prison,...
...nor the train from Villette to Paris,...
...that starts off after the dusk...
...in order to gather the following victims.
They were raw troops.
They'd marched all night.
They hadn't eaten all day.
They were under heavy fire and even though they were late... you won the battle.
It wasn't my fault they didn't arrive in time.
Only one company was late.
As soon as I could, I moved them up.
They didn't rest. I made them move on.
That's all, gentlemen.
A little harsh, isn't it?
To condemn a man to death... just because some other men happened to lag behind?
They were his troops.
And I've been wondering why they call you "The Watchdog."
It's my way. The only way I know.
Well, heaven knows I'm only the sort of beagle that the Boston Star sends out... to track down a bit of news here and there.
I don't think I'd be very comfortable being a watchdog.
Do you think I wanted to send
Col. Tolditis to his death?
He and I were friends.
I think I understand patriotism as well as the next man, General.
I'm not sure I understand your brand.
I think you'd kill your wife or child for your country's sake, if you had a wife.
I had a wife.
I'm sorry. It was only a figure of speech.
- It's all right. She is long dead.
- I'm extremely sorry, sir.
You think I am a cold man.
Cold and brutal.
If you had asked her, she would never have said so.
She's buried near here.
You saw that island off the shore?
It's a cemetery, her burial place.
I'd like to see the place.
I'll go there tomorrow.
I'd like to put some flowers on your wife's grave.
I will give you that chance.
I had planned to go there tonight.
I will take you with me.
Across the battlefield? Out there?
You mean, it's dangerous for an old man?
You forget, I am also an old soldier.
You take the lantern.
The soldiers are exhausted.
Why don't you use horses?
Horses cannot understand... why they have to work beyond endurance for their country.
But the men understand.
But these men have been fighting all day, sir.
The dead have to be buried immediately.
Do you want to know why?
He will tell you why.
Drossos.
Dr. Drossos, our American friend, would like to know... why we use the men as draft animals.
So tell him why we have to clear the field.
In the sixth division, we have two cases of septicemic plague.
35 miles away, the Athens Brigade reports every other man sick with typhus.
If it isn't stopped, our victories will mean nothing.
The horseman on the pale horse is pestilence. He follows the wars.
I'll leave this here to guide us back.
There's another watchdog for you, General.
He only guards the dead.
I have to worry about the living.
I'll wait out here.
Someone has broken into the coffin.
It's empty.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt.
After all, it's a long time since you were last here.
No, I'm sure this was the place.
Well, let's get back.
Why should anyone be here and singing?
It's a nice moonlit night.
Someone might have crossed over.
But to a cemetery?
It may be an ill omen to sing in a cemetery... but there's no law against it.
There is a law against despoiling graves.
Perhaps the singer can tell us who broke that law.
Come in.
General Pherides. I am honored, sir.
Please, won't you come in?
I came here to visit the last resting place of my wife.
I found the coffins broken, empty, all of them.
I'm extremely sorry, General.
It happened a long time ago.
The peasants were looking for antiquities to sell.
They broke into the coffins, and then they destroyed the bodies.
Has anyone been punished for this crime?
In a way, I was punished.
You see, I am an archaeologist.
And this island was the great find of my life.
Such treasures.
Antiquities dating back to Homer.
But I paid for them with my uneasy conscience.
Unwittingly I have turned good, simple people into grave robbers.
The fault is mine.
The legal guilt is theirs and must be reported to the authorities.
But all this was in the past.
15 years ago, I saw the wrong and gave up selling these things.
It is enough now for me to live with them.
I bought this house from Madame Kyra.
She consented to stay on with me.
Thanks to her, the house remains Greek.
I might have turned it into a bit of Switzerland, where I come from.
But won't you please meet my other guests?
It will be a great pleasure for them.
I'm Oliver Davis, correspondent for the Boston Star.
Master soldier...
My guests are travelers, refugees from your battle.
They crossed over to the island to avoid the shelling.
We had to destroy the bodies.
In the fires we burned them all.
There was one among them, an evil one, wicked.
Go on with your nonsense, old woman.
These are new days for Greece.
We don't believe the old foolish tales anymore.
You do not believe?
Look there.
There is one who is pale and weak.
And upstairs, there is one who is rosy and red and full of blood.
Get on with you. Find younger ears to listen to your nonsense.
General Pherides, this is Mr. St. Aubyn,
British Consul from Adrianople.
My congratulations, General.
A fine fight, sir.
But a little inconvenient for travel.
There will be no more fighting here.
The enemy is in retreat.
- Good.
- And Mrs. St. Aubyn.
Robbins, Henry Robbins, tinware.
Best grade. Lowest prices.
Robbins is no robber.
- Aren't you a little out of your territory?
- That I am.
I'd give all the blooming statues in Greece for one whiff of fish and chips.
- For one peek at Whitechapel.
- Each to his own taste.
I'm going back on the first boat to England.
I'm for the sound of Bow Bells, I am.
I'm not well. Something's wrong with me.
An odd way to explain plain drunkenness.
Quite.
He fell.
Horrible stairs.
I'm quite sure Mr. Robbins will be all right in the morning.
- Thea, this is Mr. Davis.
- How do you do?
Thea, would you give our friends wine?
- Will you have wine, sir?
- Thank you.
Were you singing when we arrived?
- Thea has a lovely voice.
- She has indeed.
And now, General Pherides.
Why, Thea...
What's the matter?
Don't you like the General?
The General is a cruel man.
He has a bad name.
- Mr. Davis.
- Excuse me.
I do hope, sir, you won't feel offended at Thea.
I'm afraid we rather spoil her.
You see, Mrs. St. Aubyn is so fond of her.
I've been asking the General to spend the night. He'll have none of it.
What? Pass up an opportunity to sleep in a soft bed, maybe have a hot bath?
General, you must be out of your mind.
If you won't think of yourself, will you please think of me?
I haven't slept in a bed for two months.
The last bath I took was a bucket of cold water I stole from your horse.
No, really?
General, I feel for this young man.
He can stay.
But I have to get back to the troops.
That battery near the beach, you planned to inspect it in the morning.
What?
You could do it on the way back and save time.
I could do that before the troops break camp.
Fine. I'm honored to have you, and we'll try to make you comfortable.
But we must be off first thing in the morning.
I'll see about the room.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.
Our house welcomes you, master soldier.
You stay to guard us.
Good night, my dear. Sleep well.
Take good care of her, Thea.
Come, I will get you to bed before that old woman gets up here.
She is always prying, peering, trying to find out something.
She is just an old woman.
Odd, perhaps, but harmless.
Mr. Albrecht, for this I will never be able to thank you enough.
- Good night.
- Good night.
This is wonderful. What's the matter?
Only General Pherides, the old watchdog of his country... would turn a bedroom into a barracks.
What's the matter? Have you forgotten how to sleep on a mattress?
I've learned to live without comfort.
I can stand a hard bed and a hard thought without worrying too much.
The girl? The one who wouldn't serve you the wine?
That got under your skin, didn't it?
She would just as soon not have a watchdog around.
I don't know what she thinks.
And I don't care.
It is not so bad. Not so bad.
You will be all right.
Perhaps you'd better get my medicine.
The bottle isn't here.
It must be in Mr. St. Aubyn's room.
I will get it for you.
Come in.
What is it, Thea?
- I came for Mrs. St. Aubyn's medicine.
- It's in my bag over there.
If you'll bring it to me, I'll mix it for you.
Why, you're frightened.
You were very bold downstairs when you refused to pour me wine.
But alone with the old watchdog, you are not so brave.
- I am not afraid of you.
- The old one in there is frightened of you.
She made me come up here.
Said you were moving around, restless.
- Planning evil things.
- I went to get medicine for my mistress.
So I see. Wait.
Tell me, about the wine... why did you refuse to serve me?
- Why do you kill your own countrymen?
- And when have I done that?
In my district, they still speak of how you collected taxes... in the little villages with field artillery.
- They were in rebellion against the taxes.
- But they were Greeks.
Who is against the law of Greece is not a Greek.
Laws can be wrong and laws can be cruel, and the people who live only by the law... are both wrong and cruel.
When I went up there, she wasn't quite so impudent. She was frightened.
Did she tell you why she wouldn't pour the wine for you?
Some silly grudge against me, for collecting taxes in her district.
That was before the war.
About time you got back to the army,
General, where there's no back talk.
- I'll be glad to get back.
- Cheer up. You won't see her again.
General Pherides...
I'd like your advice about something, a grave matter.
- What's wrong?
- Mr. Robbins. We thought him drunk.
- Well?
- I'd like the General to see him.
He was going back to hear the sound of Bow Bells.
I'm afraid he'll never hear them again.
- He complained of not feeling well.
- He staggered.
That staggering, his dying so quickly.
In your campaigns, have you never seen men... who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently, walked blindly?
I've seen men die drunk, and I've seen men die of the plague.
There's no possibility of that here, is there?
I'll send for Dr. Drossos. He'll know.
And until he comes, everyone must stay on the island.
We are faced with a very serious form of the plague, septicemic plague.
The symptoms are wavering gait... convulsions, weakness, sometimes blindness... and then death, always death.
Always death, and very quickly.
The illness is highly infectious.
Because there is a grave danger of it spreading to the army... crippling our efforts against the enemy... it has been decided that we all remain here... until the disease has run its course.
I have to cross over to the village.
Today is market day.
No one may leave the island.
I must safeguard the health of my troops.
I'm afraid you'll have to make an exception in my case, General.
In my case and my wife's.
I'm traveling on urgent business for my government.
No one may leave.
But, my dear sir,
His Majesty's government...
No one may leave the island.
General Pherides,
I respect your concern and authority... but I must leave the island.
- There are personal reasons...
- I will be glad to explain my wife's plight.
No one may leave the island.
But you must have observed that my wife is an invalid.
What about yourself, General?
What about the army?
It's better to have no General than one carrying the plague.
The doctor will tell you what to do and I will see that you do it.
We will fight the plague.
Well, if I have to be quarantined,
I couldn't pick prettier company.
I'm sorry.
Actually, I wish you weren't here at all, that you were safe away.
That's what I really mean.
That's what I should have said.
Wash all you want to.
You cannot wash away evil.
There is one among us who brings punishment on us all.
If you'd forget about the evil spirits just long enough to pass us the towels...
I'd be greatly obliged to you.
What nonsense the old woman talks.
It sounds no stranger to me than some of the things you've been saying.
Good winds and bad winds.
I've explained that to you.
The disease is transmitted by fleas.
Their bodies have an 80% moisture content.
The hot wind from the south literally burns them away.
If the sirocco blows, all danger will be over in 24 hours.
Kyra sounds just as logical to me.
That the gods send plague to punish men for harboring the Vorvolaka.
- Vorvolaka? What's that?
- Some old peasant superstition.
An elemental wolf-spirit.
Some such thing in human form.
They say it drains people of their strength and vitality until they die.
Kyra will tell you that there's more to it.
That the Vorvolaka is an evil for which the gods punish us mortals.
I suppose the next thing you know she'll be telling us that the Vorvolaka... walks among us. What nonsense.
The doctor is the doctor, and we'll do as he says.
Certainly. But one might as well go out on the cliff... and build a votive fire to Hermes.
- Not that I believe in Hermes, either.
- You had better believe in the doctor.
- He's the only one who can save us.
- We'll make a wager.
The doctor can use his science,
I'll pray to Hermes.
- We'll see who dies and who is saved.
- You can't mean that seriously.
I'll take your wager.
You broke the doctor's first order.
No contact.
I'll break no more of his orders.
Nor will you, or any of the others.
But now that I find we are to remain here,
I must insist that you stop.
Your suspicions of her, your hints, your vague little threats... they all make Thea dreadfully unhappy.
Madame Kyra, let me remind you that evil breeds evil.
And in the end, it will be you yourself who will suffer.
- I warn you...
- We die when we must.
Come in.
It's Mrs. St. Aubyn.
She has her illness again.
She hardly breathes.
Will you come to her?
- Mr. St. Aubyn?
- The others. Mustn't rouse the others.
- Let me call the doctor. It may not be...
- It is the plague.
There is nothing he can do.
If I could only see Mary.
- I will get her.
- No.
If she's ill, it might be dangerous.
And what are you doing here?
The sickness came to him last night.
He is dead.
- Where is his wife?
- She sleeps.
And does the doctor know?
Did I not give orders that the doctor should be told?
Get your mistress here at once.
Don't you understand?
The body has to be taken away.
She has to be told.
- No.
- No?
No?
Get her. Bring her to me at once.
Wait. Why don't you want to call Mrs. St. Aubyn?
- What are you afraid of?
- The shock, when she awakens.
You're hiding something.
I want to know what it is.
It's Mrs. St. Aubyn's affair, and of no concern to you.
Please listen to me.
I've got to make you understand.
- He's not dead.
- But, Mrs. St. Aubyn...
No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
- But Dr. Drossos is a Medical Officer.
- I don't care who he is.
- He doesn't know. He can't tell.
- I'll make any tests you want.
- Look.
- He's not dead!
If there is the faintest breath of life, it will cloud the mirror.
- You see?
- The breath can stop.
The heart can stop.
It still doesn't mean death.
- Men have lived...
- Quite right.
In cataleptic trance, a man may live for days with no visible sign of life.
The breath suspended, the heartbeat stilled.
But this man is dead.
What difference does it make?
Uncovered or covered, the eyes see no more.
Looks all right.
It'll give us all something to do.
Better to watch the wind and hope that it changes... than to watch each other and have no hope at all.
The wind is our only hope.
A change in the wind. Is that it, Doctor?
Of course, we can take certain simple sanitary precautions.
The General is putting all his hopes on you, Doctor.
Yes, I know.
That frightens me more than the plague.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I wonder if I could have a word with you alone, Doctor?
I have an explanation and apology to make to you.
- Certainly.
- Oh, don't go, I'm leaving.
The ledge is getting too populous.
Remember the General's instructions about gathering in groups.
Doctor, I'm extremely sorry for what happened yesterday.
- I would like to explain.
- Of course, Mrs. St. Aubyn.
All my life, I've had a dreadful fear of premature burial.
I awaken sometimes screaming with nightmares... in which I see myself buried alive... waking to find myself entombed, without air...
- stifling, and no escape.
- I know. It's not an uncommon fear.
Perhaps I have more reason for my fear than most.
You see, since childhood I've been ill.
I have fainting spells.
Trances.
Was it I who mentioned catalepsy yesterday?
Yes. I couldn't tell you then.
I've had trances lasting more than a day... with almost complete suspension of heartbeat and respiration.
I should have known. I'm terribly sorry.
I would never have spoken as I did.
But you need not fear.
I will take every precaution, make every known test.
- If you are unlucky...
- Thank you.
Now that you understand,
I'm no longer afraid.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes?
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me... as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
O, God of physicians,
God of healing, protect us.
Watch over us, thou swift-footed one, son of Zeus.
What? Did my prayer move you to join with me in worship?
It was my way of saying amen...
- and my surrender.
- To the gods?
To the gods.
They are more powerful than my science.
You feel the symptoms?
My friend, what can one say?
What is there to say?
I'll meet my old familiar enemy, death.
I have fought him before.
I've won often. Now he wins.
Let him come for me.
- This is for Dr. Drossos.
- You can't go in there.
- Let me by, please.
- Aren't you afraid?
I am not afraid of dying.
There is nothing you can do here. Get out.
I have no patience with martyrs.
How long can one live with catalepsy, Doctor?
An opiate. At least you need not suffer.
I have watched so many times.
I will watch this time, too.
You should be spared.
Your knowledge, your courage...
A fool's courage.
Fight death all your days... then die, knowing you know nothing.
That's the last of our friend.
Where are you going?
Never mind that. It does no good.
It will serve our purpose a great deal more if we were to join in prayer...
To Hermes?
I've been mocking prayer, making a joke of it out there in the ruins.
I said that I believed in nothing.
But there was a little boy in Switzerland... who used to feel the peace and quiet of the church... and listened to the minister pray.
You may have heard other words in Switzerland... but there is a prayer for all of us.
O, God, the strength of the weak and the comfort of sufferers... mercifully accept our prayers... and grant to thy servants the help of thy power... that our sickness may be turned into health... and our sorrow into joy.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Thank you.
To believe, to pray, even if only to some pagan god... so long as belief is there, it brings comfort.
That's true, isn't it, General?
- I did not pray.
- But certainly you believe in God.
When I was a boy, I was taught by the village priest, and old women like Kyra.
My belief had many sides, good sides and bad sides.
As a man, I put all that away from me.
I put my faith in what I can feel and see and know about.
Like Dr. Drossos?
Like Dr. Drossos.
I'm going out to see if there has been a change in the wind.
There goes The Watchdog.
He was so proud of that.
The guardian of his country, of the law.
Do you mean the General felt that he could guard us from death?
I don't know. I do think he had some such notion in his mind.
With Drossos as his weapon, he thought he could beat it away from us... keep it away from the army.
So, master soldier, so you pretend not to believe... and yet you feed the fires that burn for the old gods.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know.
Your friend is dead. He could not save us.
So you're trying to tell me again that it's the Vorvolaka... that we have the plague here... because a young girl is healthy and her mistress is sick.
Wait, I have already told you about that.
I have another warning.
It's a warning that does not ask for your belief.
We are dark people, out of an old soil with old blood... that moves to ancient sorceries, magic... good spirits and bad spirits.
What are you trying to tell me?
Speak plainly.
- We face death here.
- Do you suppose I don't know that?
And worse than death, evil things that I know... and that you know and Thea knows.
Things that we cannot tell in words, but which we feel.
Feel and fear.
You are an old fool. Let me pass.
Wait, I'm trying to save you.
I don't ask you to believe me.
I ask you to think on the hours when one sleeps.
Do you know what happens then?
The body may lie still in bed... but what happens to the thoughts, the spirit?
With what ancient demons does it spend its time... and in what deeds?
And Thea, does she know?
Oliver...
Would you say, Oliver, that I am different from other men?
Different? No.
- Are my thoughts different?
- Every man has his own thoughts.
You don't understand.
Are Greeks different?
I mean, old fellows like myself who were brought up in the mountain villages?
Sure. Greeks are different from Bavarians,
Bavarians are different from Irish.
Sure, you're different.
I still don't seem to make you understand.
Let me try again.
This trouble, this sickness we have... the fact that we may all die, toward that am I different?
Yeah, I suppose you are.
How?
Well, Albrecht and I, and St. Aubyn, too, before he died... we sort of take it, accept it, but you're fighting it.
It seems to me you're fighting something bigger than the plague... wrestling with something you can't see, and Kyra, too.
I get that feeling from Kyra.
- And Thea?
- She's young.
You're going out to meet her.
I wouldn't go.
What are you going to do, General?
Give me a paternal lecture on bringing Thea home early?
That's hardly the way to talk to a man and woman... who may be dead tomorrow.
- Where are you going?
- I'm not sleepy. I'm going out.
You're going back to your room.
You know what my troops call me?
- They call you "The Watchdog."
- Yes.
We have the plague here.
I said I'd stand watch against the plague.
But St. Aubyn died, the doctor died.
I tried everything, every human remedy.
And now that you've failed, you think it's some of Kyra's nonsense...
- the evil spirit, the Vorvolaka.
- I don't know, perhaps.
That is stupidity. That is superstition.
Let me by, please.
No. I'm just as unsure as you are.
I don't know... that this is a contagion of the soul that you carry... a contagion bred of evil, nameless, unearthly.
But until I do know,
I must keep you away from the others... and if necessary...
I'll make an end in the only way that we know that a Vorvolaka can be killed.
It's impossible.
I'm flesh and blood.
I remember my mother and father.
Yes, but when you awaken in the morning... what do you remember of the night before?
Of your visits to the Englishwoman?
Sometimes at night, I tend her.
I help her when she feels ill.
- I loosen the nightgown at her throat.
- At her throat.
That you remember.
Can you remember dreams?
Can a Vorvolaka in her human form remember the evil that she did at night?
How can you be so sure?
This much we know: You walk at night.
You arise in the morning refreshed and filled with life... and your friend, every day she goes paler, listless, weaker.
It is best that you stay away from the others.
I hope that I'm wrong.
I hope that everything that Kyra said is untrue... but until I know, I must watch you.
Mrs. St. Aubyn, were you ill before?
- Before?
- Before I came to work for you?
Yes, I was ill for a long time before.
But since I came, you've been worse?
Yes, that was to be expected.
Why do you ask, Thea?
You're not thinking that you're at fault?
It isn't that, is it?
I thought I had given you something better to hold on to... than those silly stories of evil spirits and malignant forces... that you heard in your home village.
But you do grow worse, weaker.
But that's not your fault, child.
It couldn't be.
It's very simple.
My illness is incurable.
Naturally, it grows worse as time goes on.
Could it be my spirit?
Something over which
I myself have no force or will?
You are good, Thea, kind and generous.
How can anything bad come from goodness?
I try to be good. I try to be kind.
- But how can I know what my spirit...
- Your spirit is yourself, Thea.
You needn't worry about Vorvolakas.
When you left this room a few moments ago... there was an open, giving look on your face.
Where were you going?
To that young man?
And why didn't you go to him?
You met the General and he talked to you of this nonsense.
That's it, isn't it?
Thea... go to the young man... and wear the same happy look you had before.
What do you mean, spying on us like this?
You must have known we were here.
- That is why I came.
- Bosh. Come on, Thea.
You might as well stay here, Davis.
The island is small, and wherever you go, I'll go too.
- It's for your own safety.
- Wait a minute.
You really mean that, don't you?
You're really concerned.
And you're going to tag along just to protect me.
- I am concerned.
- Let me get this straight.
You feel that Thea is some sort of evil influence... and can harm me and the other people here, too. Is that it?
What are you going to do about it?
When I am sure, I will destroy her.
General, you're right.
There is something here more dangerous than septicemic plague.
More dangerous as far as Thea is concerned.
And that's your own crazy thoughts about her.
You can say whatever you like.
The only safe thing for Thea is to get her off the island.
We'll leave in the morning.
I'll row you over.
You can't go. You'll spread the plague.
You might have thought about that before you threatened her.
- Why can't you come with us?
- I've told you, Thea.
But even if it's true... even if there's no chance of your getting well... it would still be better if you were with us.
You and Oliver don't know where you'll be or what will happen.
You couldn't shield me against what I fear most.
I don't dare go with you.
Mr. Albrecht, will he know what to do?
Yes, I'll explain everything to him.
You must be off.
Oliver will be waiting for you.
No, he's to meet me later.
God bless you.
Mr. Albrecht, the American, where are they?
They are not in this room.
I cannot see through stone and mortar, like some I know.
- Thea, darling, what happened?
- The General, he wrecked the boat.
- He won't let me leave here alive.
- It's all right.
He'll not harm you. I'll see to that.
General Pherides... this self-appointed tyranny of yours cannot be tolerated.
What you have done before was bad enough.
Harassing everyone with your orders... forcing immediate burial without time for prayer or mourning.
But now this.
Preventing these young people from leaving... persecuting a dear and lovely girl like Thea... terrorizing her with your ugly, savage superstitions...
I will not have it!
There are other men here, sane men.
They will know how to deal with you.
I warn you, General. Leave Thea alone.
What must be done, I will do.
Does that include smashing the only boat on the island?
I told you that no one could leave.
And I told you, General... that your orders do not apply to me or any civilian.
You haven't any rights over us.
If you do anything else to threaten Thea, General...
I'll forget that we've been friends.
Thea.
Thea, you must help me.
You did call them, didn't you, Kyra?
I told you, I knocked.
The girl said her mistress wasn't well.
Maybe you can make up a tray after dinner. Thea will probably be hungry.
I asked. The girl said she wanted nothing.
It has been bright and warm today, hardly a breath of wind.
We can all take comfort in the thought that the wind may change tomorrow.
We always have these warm, still days before the sirocco begins to blow.
It hasn't changed yet.
What do you do, Vorvolaka?
What do you do behind locked doors?
Vorvolaka. Vorvolaka.
Vorvolaka...
I have twisted rose briar before your door.
The thorns that pierced His brow will tear your flesh, evil one.
I have put salt in the fire and a cross of ashes on the door.
Vorvolaka. Vorvolaka.
Vorvolaka, born of evil... sinful and corrupt... your hands are bloody with violence... your mouth bitter with the taste of sin and corruption.
You are guilty and abhorred.
Vorvolaka. Vorvolaka.
Please, I beg of you...
My fault...
Is it my fault?
I've been waiting.
I did not want him to hear.
The girl, she is still in the Englishwoman's room.
Let her stay.
All night long I heard her moving, and sometimes someone crying.
Now everything is still. The door is locked.
You knocked?
No one answered. It was quiet like a tomb.
Good morning.
Look.
- She must have sickened last night.
- No, she was not like the others.
She fell down and hasn't moved since.
She was not like the others.
Drossos told me the plague differs.
Some it strikes down almost like that.
She fainted often, but you can't stay in a faint all night.
Look into the eyes of that one.
You'll see how she died.
I don't know what's the matter with the General. Something up here.
You'd better stay out of his way.
Get down to the ruins.
- But Mrs. St. Aubyn?
- We'll see that everything's done.
- It's best that you keep out of his way.
- Please, I'd rather stay.
It's bad enough to have the plague.
I don't want a madman to contend with.
The General's almost rational when you're not around.
Stay out of his way.
Her heart has stopped. There is no breath.
Here, try the mirror.
She would have wanted us to do that.
Nothing. Help me get the box up here.
General, the wind.
Look, the wind has changed to the south.
It's the sirocco.
We'll be able to leave this place... and you can take command of your troops again.
I've had command for the last time.
Oh, come now, General.
You'll feel a lot better after we leave this accursed island.
I shall never leave the island.
I'm going to get Albrecht.
Watch the General for me.
Soldier, you stayed your hand.
Now the plague punishes you.
The Vorvolaka still lives, rose-cheeked and full of blood.
I am alone with her.
I am not dead yet. She shall not harm you.
Alone with her in that dark room.
I am afraid.
And now there's that other one.
Who dies by a Vorvolaka becomes a Vorvolaka.
That other one, she's in her coffin... but she struggles to come out, to prey on us.
Hear her? Hear?
The wood splintering.
I can hear it.
I hear it.
Shut me in. In the dark.
Shut me in again.
Closed in. Shut in.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears
I knew back at Marblehead.
The great god of the sea, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing.
He raked the wine-dark ocean with it and stirred the loud-sounding waves.
They still use spears like that in Corinth.
Vorvolaka, I hear her. I hear her.
He seems to know you're out here.
It sets him off.
Why don't you get to bed?
You need some sleep.
A little frightening up there?
Well, I can't blame you.
Outside? It's windy, but it's warm.
Why don't you sit out there... and I'll join you when the General quiets down a bit?
Napping?
It's the warm wind. It makes one sleepy.
The General's asleep. I'll get Thea back.
Who's there?
Is that you, Oliver?
- Kyra?
- Kyra!
What's the matter?
In the tunnel, something white. Maybe...
Maybe what?
Albrecht, do you remember what Mrs. St. Aubyn said?
That business about being in a trance?
Well, she must have been.
She didn't even recognize Thea in the tunnel.
She's out of her mind. Mad.
- What are you talking about?
- We put her in that coffin alive.
The box has been broken.
She's out here somewhere.
You can't go with us.
We'll need your help after we find her.
Vorvolaka.
Mrs. St. Aubyn.
Mrs. St. Aubyn, wait.
Wait, Mrs. St. Aubyn.
Thea.
I saw the Vorvolaka. I saw her.
The grave clothes, wings... the face... eyes of death and evil.
Yes, yes.
She came out of the darkness.
She must be destroyed.
It is done.
She has gone back to endless night.
Back of his madness, there was something simple, good.
He wanted to protect us.
English
May sound like music to her. I can do better with my teeth and a cold shower.
Oh, she's a local.
When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they want to wallow in Latin glamour.
- This is a bad town for blonds.
- Yes, so I've noticed.
Jerry's noticed.
He'll come up with something.
- You think he's sort of nice, don't you?
- Why not?
He's a good press agent.
- And a good friend.
- You're lucky.
Wish he'd front-page for me.
I don't mean this personally,
Miss Walker, but it's ironic.
I mean, about you being a big star...
...and me being just a cigarette girl.
- I know, I know.
You've got the talent, I got the breaks.
I hear it in every nightclub.
- Get him out of here!
- Kiki.
- Nothing to be afraid of.
- Makes no difference. Get him out.
- Don't you wanna guess what I cooked up?
- That's easy. Me.
I thought, "Is Kiki just gonna walk out there tonight...
...walk out cold, in front of a bunch of gawks...
...that think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life?
No, sir. Not my client.
She's gonna make an entrance this town will remember for the rest of their lives."
On his back, I suppose.
No, I thought that would be corny.
I want you to lead him in on the leash.
- You're too good to me.
- You know what's between us.
Why, we're a thing. But this is serious.
Big competition.
Clo-Clo?
I thought you might like to strut the kitten in right in the middle of her act.
Come on down. See what a picture you'd make with this for a pet.
If you've got cold feet,
I'll take over for you.
That red dress of yours fits me just perfect.
I'll bet someday you try on my coffin.
And I hope it fits you just perfect.
You look awful good in that three-alarm number.
Red dress?
No.
The black one.
Then I'll be just like him.
Don't just stand there, Kiki.
You're on-stage.
They're all looking at you.
No leopard, chief.
No cats, no kittens, nothing.
We have to tackle the houses.
Hey, mister. Remember what you said.
Ten bucks for the loan of my cat,
225 if anything happened to it.
Nothing has happened to it.
It's up that alley and can't get out.
- They'll find it.
- You don't get the idea, mister.
These cops, banging those pans, flashing those lights...
...they're gonna scare that poor cat of mine. Cats are funny, mister.
They don't want to hurt you.
But if you scare them, they go crazy.
These cops, they don't know what they're doing.
Maybe Mr. Manning would like to help me.
- I don't need a leopard, I have talent.
- There's enough cat in...
Good night, Mr. Publicity Man.
Why are you hurrying, Clo-Clo?
- Oh, it's you, faker.
- Take a card, Clo-Clo.
See what the night holds for you.
Your cards are a joke.
- I wouldn't give you one centavo.
- One card, Clo-Clo...
...for nothing.
Faker.
Hello, Shorty.
- Hello, chiquita.
- Hello, Clo-Clo.
But, Mamacita, why can't Pedro go this time? I'm so tired.
I'm too young.
If your father comes home and there are no tortillas, he'll shout.
Tomorrow it will be over town that Juan Delgado's family...
...is too poor to buy cornmeal.
- I know what she's afraid of.
This.
- And what, por todos los santos, is this?
- The leopard, Mamacita.
They say a lady at the El Pueblo had it on a string, and it ran away.
- It hasn't been found yet.
- A leopard.
They're big. And they jump on you.
Did you ever meet one of those things yet when you went to the store for me?
Then you won't meet one this time either.
Now get out. Do as I told you.
Now, you will not come in again.
Not till you bring the cornmeal with you.
Señora. Señora Calderon.
- It is Teresa, señora. Teresa Delgado.
- The store is closed.
I want a sack of cornmeal for my father's supper.
- Tomorrow.
- It will only take a second.
Please, or I must go clear across the arroyo to the big grocery.
It means taking off the lock again, putting on the light, measuring the meal.
It's too much trouble.
Once I close, I close.
Señora.
Thank you.
Oh, the toy birds.
You've seen them before. I couldn't chase you away when you were a little girl.
I'd forgotten them.
Every day you see them, and you'd forgotten them?
Oh, now I remember my little Teresita.
Now I remember the little girl who was afraid of the dark.
- Shouldn't send you.
- I'm not afraid.
What could happen to me?
I'll pay you tomorrow.
Next time you come.
The poor don't cheat one another.
We're all poor together.
Mamacita, let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!
If you love me, let me in!
"Mamacita, let me in, now that I've spent half the night getting the cornmeal."
He's coming! He's coming closer!
I can see it!
Just what she needs. Someone to nip at her heels and hurry her up.
Wait, Teresa. I come. I will let you in!
Only a moment, querida!
Your mother is here.
Your mother will let you in.
This evidence having been presented before me on this, the 10th day of April...
...I hereby declare that
Teresa Guadalupe Maria Delgado...
...was brought to her death by violence resulting from the release of a wild animal.
A leopard purportedly on theatrical exhibition in this city.
Death by accident.
Sister, I want the family to have this.
It might help with the funeral expenses.
It's all right, my friends.
It is the will of God.
Supposing I slip them a few bucks, help with the funeral expenses.
Don't be soft.
An unfortunate accident.
Nobody blames you, Mr. Manning.
You mustn't feel bad.
Would you sign here, please?
You can go now, Manning. There's no way they can hold you legally responsible.
Thanks, sheriff.
Oh, that...
That leopard's got to be found.
I'm forming a posse.
I can use some help.
I haven't done posse work since my matinee-kid days...
...when I rode with Tom Mix at the old Bijou Theatre.
- Go on foot.
- I'm sorry, sheriff...
...but I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
I suppose you don't feel bad.
- Who was that man?
- Oh, I don't know. A witness.
Seemed to know something about animals.
You know, expert testimony.
Did he have to look at the body?
We all had to look at the body.
It was awful, Kiki.
Excuse us, please.
- That card again?
- I made a mistake.
It was a misdeal. I'll try once more.
It's a black card and a bad card.
But not the card of the cat.
Not the card of four-footed things.
I saw Teresa.
Maybe I was the last one to see her, except...
...perhaps her mamacita and her little brother.
- I was going past the house...
- They were hunting the leopard again.
Out in the country this time, but they didn't get him.
They're such fools.
Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it? He's an Indian.
Men are all fools.
They like to make a big show...
...hunt and shout.
That bad card again?
What did they say before the bad card came up?
"You'll meet a rich man and he will give you money."
You and your cards.
Meet a rich man.
I look for them with money.
And what rich man hasn't money?
For what was I born if it wasn't for money?
- You're not telling me anything.
- Watch and see.
A day or a week, certainly in a month, you'll have money from a man.
And then you...
And then what?
I'll have to deal the cards again.
I made a mistake.
You and your mistakes.
Get out. I have to get dressed for the supper show.
And I don't want you around here putting the evil eye on me.
- You decent?
- Yes. Come in.
Well, does everybody love us?
You've been gone long enough to soft-soap 20 city editors.
Yeah.
Did you get the leopard?
Maybe it's the altitude, you chasing around with a bunch of boots-and-saddle boys.
Whole town's in a state, Kiki.
Locked doors, people huddled together like scared sheep...
...nobody on the streets.
Our first real break, and we throw wild animals at the audience.
Yeah.
Oh, let's forget it.
I'm buying a drink for a fellow that was on the posse with me.
Nice guy. Come along.
He'll get a kick out of meeting you.
Who is he?
You remember him from this morning.
Galbraith.
Just about got time to make it before the supper show.
Jack rabbits, mesquite and sagebrush.
Sagebrush, mesquite and jack rabbits.
Thrills and excitement all the way.
Not a sign of the leopard?
Jerry tells me you're an expert with animals. Couldn't you tell where it went?
To know where it went, you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard.
You can hardly describe me as an expert in hunting lost leopards.
I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East.
- I gave that up.
- What do you do now?
There's a little museum here in town.
They hired me to run it.
We have some interesting exhibits in Indian arts and crafts.
It's fun. I like living here in New Mexico.
- But why did you give up teaching?
- Various reasons.
But I don't see why you should be interested in my rather dusty career...
...teacher, curator...
...when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
- Show business?
- Yes. It's always fascinated me.
You know, once, when I was a youngster,
I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in Zaza.
After the play, I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
So you can see, meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter, whoever she was.
In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here.
Particularly after the backfire on Jerry's publicity stunt with the leopard.
- Yes, that was unfortunate.
- That was a calamity.
Look.
Well, I'm on next.
You won't hear anything like that.
I'm not a favorite since I let that leopard loose.
If you're as talented as you're beautiful, you have nothing to worry about.
Thank you.
Well, I'd best be off.
Oh, say...
...there's something I want to ask you.
It's about the leopard.
Are you worrying about its killing someone else?
Not me. I'm not worried about anything.
Then why did you come on the posse this morning? You've got strange notions.
Why do you feel you must seem hard and disinterested?
This morning I heard you tell Robles you didn't wanna come, yet you came.
That wasn't easy for a tenderfoot like you.
Listen, Galbraith. Where I was brought up, you had to be tough.
It was a tough neighborhood.
I learned it didn't pay to let anybody know how you feel or really think.
All right, all right.
So I feel rotten nervous.
I wanna go out. Be every place at once.
Be sure that that cat...
...doesn't hurt anyone else.
- It's a wild animal.
Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people...
...when it can get into open country?
- Sure, sure. That's right, isn't it?
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
I've learned one thing about life.
We're a good deal like that ball dancing on the fountain.
We know as little about the forces that move us...
...and move the world around us, as that empty ball does...
...about the water that pushes it into the air, lets it fall, and catches it again.
You shouldn't feel too bad about Teresa Delgado.
Roses are like children.
Some have short legs...
...some have long ones. Thank you.
You can't sell it. It's a day old.
But my stomach is not a day old.
If I don't sell flowers...
...I don't eat. And I love to eat.
- I'll tell everyone you gave it to me.
- That'll be good for your business.
- Yes, but bad for my wife.
Thank you.
My mistress, Señorita Consuelo Contreras, does not have to beg for flowers.
- She won't miss one.
- Thank your señorita for me.
It will spoil the birthday song, Rosita, if we wake her too soon.
Good morning on your birthday,
Señorita Consuelo.
It is a good morning, niña.
See how the sun is shining for you.
What a lovely way to wake up.
It's so beautiful, Cousin Felipe.
Thank you for buying it.
How carefully you must have picked it out.
Had you forgotten it was your birthday?
- I believe you had.
- No.
I'm so happy, so happy.
Rosita.
Hurry now, my sweet.
Or we'll be late for Mass.
Quick, give it to me.
He'll be waiting.
You must say that you want to take some roses to your father's grave.
At 4. He'll be there at 4.
The time will never pass.
Aren't you afraid you'll have a headache, working so long?
If we don't work on these, they'll never get done. And you'll be a poor bride.
It is late, isn't it? Too late, I'm afraid, for you to go the cemetery today.
Oh, no. I must go to the cemetery.
It's my birthday.
I did not come into this world a middle-aged widow, Consuelita.
Everything you think, everything you do...
...I thought and did before you.
And my mother before me.
You are so young.
I don't want you to look back on anything lacking in dignity a few years from now.
Naturally, young men will be attracted to you.
They should come here to your house.
They should be introduced to you by their parents.
Or by your cousin Felipe.
Or by some older relative.
Very well. Get Rosita and go.
Oh, Mama. I'll hurry. I'll be right back.
- I will see you back at the house, señorita.
- You're late this evening, señorita.
I have brought flowers for my father's grave. It will only take a moment.
Time is strange. A moment can be as short as a breath or as long as eternity.
Don't linger.
The gates are locked at 6.
You must forgive me, Father, for deceiving Mother.
She will meet Raoul soon and everything will be as you would wish. I promise.
Raoul.
Raoul.
Let me out.
Let me out!
Wait.
Wait!
- Hello. Who's there?
- Here. I'm in here behind the wall.
Please get me out.
I've been locked in.
You wait there and I'll get someone to lend me a ladder.
No, don't leave me! Don't go away.
You're all right now.
It's just a matter of a few minutes.
- You'll come back?
- Stay just where you are.
I'll be back before you know it.
Why?
Why?
Her boyfriend.
Take him out of here and give him something to keep him quiet.
The leopard again.
- Any witnesses?
- Only secondary witnesses.
The man that was coming to help her out.
The man he borrowed the ladder from.
They found the body.
And the gatekeeper.
I warned her. I told her the gates would be closed.
It's all right, my friend.
It wasn't your fault, we know.
Anything else? Clues?
It's the leopard, all right.
A broken claw, some black hairs.
There are claw marks on the tree.
He must have made those getting out.
Notice the way they've been dug in from above.
And these leaves on the ground.
They don't fall this time of the year.
Must have shaken down on her when it jumped.
Doc.
- Something you said to me the other day.
- Yes?
You said that the leopard would head for open country.
- That it wouldn't stay in the city.
- Sure. What's that got to do with this?
Why did it come here and why didn't it stay here?
It's got trees and bushes here.
Outside, just cement and asphalt.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard.
This leopard's another matter.
A caged animal traveling around with
Charlie How-Come for years and years.
- That's why it kills human beings.
- Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
Yes, but it doesn't...
- Doesn't eat what it kills.
- Caged animals are unpredictable.
They're like frustrated human beings.
I can't answer your question.
That's why it just mauls and tears them.
There's something wrong with this whole setup.
Yes, there is something wrong.
People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it.
What risks they make other people run.
What agony and sorrow...
...they bring to other people.
- I know all that, chief.
I don't like it any better than you.
But there's something else.
- Now, look, Jerry...
- Just a minute. Let him go on.
I can understand how the cat could kill the first girl. Charlie How-Come told me.
All that noise and those lights.
Scared crazy, it would do anything.
But there was nothing to frighten it here.
Nothing but a little girl in a cemetery.
What are you getting at?
Nothing much. Only that it might not be a cat this time.
Here, I can sell you the secret of the cat's strength.
The cat's vitality for only $ 1.
One dollar.
One dollar.
I can't make a buck without my leopard, Mr. Manning.
You'll have to find my cat or pay up.
Well, don't get excited, Charlie.
Have a little patience.
I'll fix everything for you.
You don't want that cat.
It's killed two people.
No, sir.
You mean that girl in the cemetery?
My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you before, cats don't go looking for trouble.
If that cat's alive, he's probably out in the country...
...hiding under a bush, starving to death.
- Oh, you really think so, Charlie?
- Sure.
That cat ain't mean.
For six years, I feed him out of my own hand.
Why don't he kill me?
At night, in the truck,
I let him out of the cage.
When I'm falling asleep,
I hear him walking back and forth.
I go to sleep.
He don't hurt me.
They all say your cat killed that second girl.
They don't say it to me.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie.
I'd like to have you hear his side of it, his reasons.
- You wanna hear them?
- Sure.
- Get in the truck.
- Where is this man?
Up at the museum.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- You know Charlie How-Come.
- We were old friends.
- Come to look around?
- More or less.
Take you about.
Got some nice things.
Charlie and I were talking.
That's why I wanted see you.
- About Charlie's leopard?
- Yes.
Here's something should interest you, Charlie.
A stone leopard head made by your ancestors some 600 years ago.
They used it in ceremonies.
The jaguar, in fact all the cat family...
...were considered the personification of force and violence...
...in their religious rights.
- Don't look like a leopard to me.
He doesn't think his leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
- Charlie likes his leopard.
- I like my leopard.
He was quick to admit that it killed the first girl.
Charlie, why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Not scared enough.
You know, nothing to scare it.
- If a leopard didn't do it, what did?
- It might be a man.
Yes, it might be.
But why would a man do it?
For what?
It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion.
- She had no enemies.
- Yeah, well, there's all sorts of men.
I've met some pretty funny ones in bars and nightclubs.
Oh, I understand what you mean.
Demented men, pathological cases.
What sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave traces of a leopard?
- Crazy guy.
- But he'd have to know about leopards...
...have access to leopard claws and hair.
Well, this is our latest find.
We'd given up digging in a certain barrow.
I went back and tried it again.
Just had a hunch.
A hunch.
That's all I've got in this leopard thing.
Just a hunch.
It was a man.
- But what sort of a man?
- I don't know.
You, Charlie, you know about leopards.
You might have an old claw and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage, eh?
- Sure.
- No, I'm serious about this.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory.
Let's take a step further.
- You drink, don't you, Charlie?
- Yeah, I drink.
- And when you drink, you get drunk?
- Sure.
Then what do you do?
I sleep it off.
But between the time you leave the cantina...
...and fall into bed in that truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
I don't know.
That's just it. That's what I'm driving at.
You could do anything in that time.
- But Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
- Yes.
- I was drunk last night, Mr. Manning.
- See? There's a suspect for you, Jerry.
Come on, Charlie.
We'll find another and better suspect.
- Don't you wanna see the rest?
- Some other time.
I'm sick.
Here, Charlie. Have a cigarette.
He was only kidding.
No, he wasn't kidding.
I'm sick.
Claw women?
Hurt little girls?
No.
I don't know.
- I want to see Robles.
- What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
You didn't do it.
You know you didn't do it.
I don't know.
I want him to lock me up.
This is crazy, Charlie.
You know you didn't do it.
You better lock me up.
I've been trying to tell him.
But he won't listen to me.
Wait a minute.
Let me get one thing clear.
Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
No.
- No, he was kidding him.
- You better lock me up.
If I do things like that,
I want to be put away.
- I don't want to hurt nobody. Nobody.
- That's okay, Charlie.
If it'll make you feel any better, I'll put you away for a few days. Come on, son.
Two men for one beat?
Afraid of the big cat, eh?
Sure. I've got a family.
- Hello.
- Well, hello there.
- It's been a half-hour since we ordered.
- Let's have a drink while we wait.
Don't bother. I don't want one.
- Do you, Dwight?
- No. No, thank you.
- Want to dance, Helene?
- I suppose so.
Dwight.
- Well, hello.
- We seem to be playing tag.
- Or maybe hide-and-seek, huh?
- Is someone with you?
- Can I get you a drink?
- Sure, why not?
Just a minute.
You've ordered this like a sensible girl, but you don't have to drink it.
Do you want it?
Or do you want another beer?
Two beers. Big ones.
It's taken this impossible trip to show me what an old fool Father has become.
When you marry champagne, you can't trade it in for beer.
- You're stuck with it.
- I don't understand that fancy talk.
You mean I'm a gold digger?
Sure, I'm a gold digger. Why not?
Why not, if you like it?
If that's what you want.
Maybe you think I should just forget all about money.
Forget about Mama and the kids and the unpaid bills and the rent...
...and marry some poor dope like Carlos Dominguez and get fat.
- Who's Carlos Don-What's-His-Name?
- Nobody.
- Boy who works in a grocery.
- Good-looking?
- Yeah.
- Nice fellow?
- Is he in love with you?
- I don't know.
Why do you ask so many questions?
What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel?
Feelings don't buy houses and pay for rent and help bring up kids...
...and get clothes for them...
- Drink your beer. Don't get so excited.
Well...
- Madam will be waiting at the entrance.
- Madam will be waiting.
Madam ought to go on waiting.
To have such a father and treat him like...
Like a poor cousin.
- For Mama and the kids.
- What about me?
Oh, you'll get your money from your husband.
- Husband?
- Carlos What's-His-Name.
The boy at the grocery.
Well, did he give you a lot of money?
- Who?
- The elderly man I told you about.
He was old enough, but you slipped up on the money.
Try it again, why don't you?
Put your wish in them.
- Money?
- Maybe a honeymoon.
- Cut.
- What are you doing that for?
Again.
Something black.
- Something on its way to you.
- Go on.
Let me see it.
Don't look at that.
Let me see it.
- Death card.
- Maybe not.
Cards mean different things at different times.
Walk a little way with me, huh?
Well...
...see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
Hey, chiquita.
Want a lift?
- What way are you going?
- Your way.
- What's the matter?
- Your car.
What color is it?
- Black.
- Get out of here.
- Get away from me with that!
- What do you mean, "that"?
Pepita.
Pepita.
Tomorrow I'm going to buy you the most beautiful dress in the whole world.
You don't believe me, do you?
Wait until you see what I have.
Then you'll believe me.
Is that you, Gabriella?
What are you doing?
Have you lost something?
Yes. Money.
I must have lost it in the street.
Are you going out again?
Why don't you stay at home and rest.
Gabriella.
Carlos.
- You sent for the state hunters?
- I wired for them this morning.
- State hunters?
- Professional hunters.
- They rid the state of cougars.
- You still think it was the leopard.
Anything in Clo-Clo's death to suggest it wasn't the leopard?
- Yes. The lipstick.
- Why?
Well, ask Kiki. Ask any woman.
Girls don't put on lipstick at night...
...on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man, or gonna meet a man.
Just the same,
I'm gonna use the state hunters.
Come on, Charlie.
Give you a lift back to town.
Now I know I didn't hurt anybody when I was drunk.
Of course not, Charlie.
I never thought you did.
You know a lot, taken a lot of fancy college courses and that kind of stuff.
If it were a man, what kind of a man would kill like that?
All those fancy courses were about the dead, not the living.
All right, the dead then.
In history, there must have been men like that.
- Men with kinks in their brains.
- There've been men who killed for pleasure.
Strange pleasure.
There was Bluebeard in France,
Jack the Ripper in London.
It's not uncommon.
And if there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain, running around loose...
...what would he be like?
He'd be a hard man to find, Jerry.
Particularly if he were a clever man.
He'd go about his ordinary business calmly.
Except when the fit to kill was on him.
You've thought about all this before.
You know it isn't the leopard, don't you?
There you are.
Here's luck to you both in Chicago.
Must be great to be getting out of here, going to a real city.
It's a pretty good feeling.
This place closing for the weekend...
...will give us a couple days to rest.
- I can use them.
What is this processionist business?
Do they close the café every year for it?
It's the big ceremony around here.
We have it every year.
All the cafés and saloons close.
- Why don't you stay over for it?
- All I want to do is get to Chicago.
Are you lucky, you two.
The big buses go by my house.
At night, I can hear the sound of their tires on the road.
Like someone humming.
I think of Chicago and New York...
...being somebody, being a real entertainer.
Don't worry, kid. You'll get there.
These for Señorita Kiki.
They've called your cab.
Here we go.
- That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
- He's a nice guy.
- We ought to keep in touch with him.
- Pretty.
You know, it's funny. Flowers only mean one thing to me now.
- I know. Funerals.
- Yes.
Jerry.
These flowers weren't really meant for me.
You mean you want to take them by the cemetery?
Yes. Do you mind?
And she waited here for him?
Robles says it happened something like that.
Belmonte waited here for her and then he left.
She missed him by just a few minutes.
What do you suppose she thought about in here alone?
Such a sad little place.
What do you want to stay here for?
Lt'll make you feel badly.
- Maybe I want to feel badly.
- That doesn't make sense.
Maybe I'm tired of pretending that nothing bothers me.
That all I care about is myself.
- Myself and my 2-by-4 career.
- What else do you care about, Kicks?
You. Us.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks.
Sometimes those things get lost.
We've been so busy trying to be tough guys.
Confession.
I'm a complete softie.
I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick since that leopard got loose.
If that's what it takes to make a softie, there's two of us.
Kiki...
...it wasn't the leopard.
- Well, you're positive of that, aren't you?
- I'm absolutely sure.
We're not going to catch a train. We're gonna stay here and catch a murderer.
You don't mind staying?
You know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again.
I'm not much of a detective.
I don't know how to start.
All I know is I wanna do something about all this.
Oh, and, Kiki, I'm out of cash.
You'll have to loan me a little dough.
Didn't you take your cut out of the check?
Yeah, sure. But, well, I got clipped in a crap game.
That's funny. I never knew you to lose that much before.
- In fact, I'm out of cash myself.
- Oh, but you can't be.
I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise, and...
Eloise hasn't got enough of anything to make a dent in your paycheck.
All right. I'm not ashamed of it.
I split it two ways and...
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
How did you know?
Why, you did the same thing yourself.
- Must get lonely here.
- No.
I have many friends.
But they don't bother me with talk.
I guess that'll hold you.
Two hundred twenty-five dollar you owe me.
- You found the leopard?
- What's left of him.
- Where did you find him?
- North, in an arroyo.
Shot through the head.
Maybe a week ago. No good.
Skin, everything gone.
What arroyo, Charlie?
How do you get to it?
Well, you go...
And here is Three Tree Mesa.
And here I go out of the big arroyo into the canyon.
That's the place. I remember.
My feet were so sore I couldn't make it...
...but Galbraith went on up by himself.
- Just a moment.
Miss Walker, will you please sit alongside of me?
- You see, I can't stand, so you must sit.
- Thank you very much, but...
- Don't you understand?
- You think Galbraith found the leopard...
...the day he went on the posse.
- I'm sure of it.
Isn't that beautiful?
There's no one in the whole state like this fellow.
- He's a genius in his own line.
- Galbraith knows something.
- He's as good as said so.
- Now, look...
...l'm not interested in what somebody thinks that somebody else thinks.
You bring me some facts, and I'll act upon them.
- The leopard in the bag is a fact.
- It is.
I'm taking it to headquarters for examination.
But you won't go to Galbraith with me?
Offend a good citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? Oh, no.
I'm in office to protect the taxpayers' money, not to throw it away.
Here you are, son. Thank you.
Come on, Charlie.
Now we'll have to do it ourselves.
We will.
A lovely face and a tender smile.
That's what you see in the photograph, isn't it?
A smear of blood and torn rags in a huddle on the ground.
- That's what I see.
- I know. I was there.
You're not here at night when she calls out.
I hear her screaming, "Raoul, get me out!"
Take it easy, boy.
I want to talk to you.
Maybe there's something I can do.
- Have a drink.
- No.
That's no good for you.
You've got to kick, fight with something to get it out of your system.
In Consuelo's case, there was nothing to fight.
Nothing except fate and a dumb brute animal.
But I've got something to tell you that will change all that.
It wasn't an animal. It was a man.
A man.
- Who?
- I don't know.
And I need your help to find out.
- Oh, Mr. Galbraith. I'm so glad you're here.
- Oh, good evening.
You know what this procession's all about.
I've lived here all my life, but I don't know what the procession means.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here.
So they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians...
...was wiped out by the Conquistadores back in the 17th century.
A band of monks buried the dead, prayed for them, and did penance for their deaths.
- That's what this is supposed to be.
- Oh, that's very interesting.
Now that you've had your history lesson,
I'll get on to the museum.
Well, thank you.
Help.
Help.
Get me out.
I've disturbed you. I'm sorry.
Miss Walker, I didn't expect anyone.
I came up on the spur of the moment.
I wanted to see the processions.
I remembered your kind invitations.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated.
There isn't much of a view of the procession from here.
- I thought they came right past here.
- They do.
But there are no lights out there.
They'll just be shadows.
It's not so terribly dark out.
If we turn off the lights, we can see them.
- No use turning them off till they get here.
- But they're coming. Listen.
Hear them?
Turn off the lights.
Wait.
No, really, I can see them.
They're coming now.
Turn off the lights.
Raoul, don't. Put that gun away.
Kiki.
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
- It was you, Galbraith.
- No.
- It was you.
- No, I tell you. No.
You killed the leopard. We know that.
You killed Consuelo.
- You killed Clo-Clo. Then tonight...
- I didn't do anything.
She screamed.
Something frightened her.
Consuelo screamed too.
So did Clo-Clo. Why did you do it?
- Tell me why.
- Why do you accuse me?
You don't know what you're doing.
You don't understand.
Nobody understands.
You don't know what it means to be tormented this way.
- Tormented? Why?
- I couldn't rest. I couldn't sleep.
All I could see was
Teresa Delgado's body.
Broken, mangled.
I saw it day and night.
It was waiting everywhere I turned.
- And then you found the leopard.
- I didn't want to kill.
But I had to.
I heard the little girl in the cemetery talking to the man in the auto.
When he went away...
...I thought I was going to help her get over the wall.
I can't remember.
I looked down.
In the darkness, I saw her white face.
The eyes full of fear.
Fear. That was it.
The little frail body...
...the soft skin.
And then...
...she screamed.
Consuelo.
It's a serious charge, Belmonte.
You'll have to stand trial for murder.
We stood here once before.
I know.
Teresa.
I hated you that day.
You and your flip talk.
- That little girl lying dead.
- I know.
How do you think I felt when you told me not to be soft?
Oh, Jerry, I want you to be soft.
You are soft inside, where it counts.
I wanted it that day too...
...but I didn't dare tell you.
- Kiki...
...Galbraith said something to me, something that you ought to know.
We were talking, and he said that people were like that ball...
...in the fountain at the hotel.
That they get pushed around by things bigger than themselves.
That's the way it was with us.
Only we were too small to see it that way.
[ENGLISH]
[Laughing, Chattering]
[Object Thuds]
[Screams]
Look!
It's old Ogilby's place.
Call the fire department!
[Fire Truck Bell Ringing]
Hey, look where you're going, can't ya?
Here! What's the idea of walking into me like that?
- Is something the matter, sir?
- Is he drunk?
Are you feeling badly, sir?
No, I'm... I'm all right now.
Thank you.
That... That's blood!
[Fire Truck Bell Ringing]
Look! You can see the fire from here.
[Ringing Continues]
[Piano]
Oh, here you are, George.
[Man] We were beginning to wonder
what happened to you.
You didn't come home last night, did you?
Oh, no.
I stayed with some friends.
We found the door open, so we came in.
How did you get that cut?
I bumped into a man carrying some baskets a little while ago.
- I'll get something to clean it.
- You sure you're all right?
- Yes, of course.
- Hmm.
Barbara's just been playing me the opening of your new concerto.
The best work you've ever done.
I always felt you were very gifted.
I've been waiting for you to do something like this.
As you know, in December I have a series of musical soirees in my house.
Now I'd like to include a new and modern work.
So, if you can finish this in time?
Naturally you'll be at the piano.
Well?
- And you'd be conducting, Sir Henry?
- Yes.
I'm enormously complimented.
Of course everything depends on how you complete it.
You're already established as a musician.
If this concerto is successful... it could mean international recognition of all your work.
I'd like to help bring that about.
Thank you, sir.
That's all I have to say.
Put everything else aside, my dear boy.
- Finish it.
- I'm so pleased.
So am I. Good heavens!
I shall be late for the philharmonic.
I think I've just time to see you home.
- Perhaps George will, if you're late.
- Of course.
- Thank you.
- Good-bye, Father.
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye, sir, and thank you.
- You've been exceedingly kind.
- Not at all.
I don't know how
I shall ever thank you.
There's no need.
Barbara...
I didn't stay with friends last night.
You mean that it's happened again?
I don't know where I've been or what I've done.
I remember having gone out last evening... and then nothing more until
I found myself a while ago over in Fulham.
There's the whole day missing.
Did you... do anything this time?
Not that I can recall.
Where could I have got this?
- I'll throw it away.
- No.
I'll keep it.
[Man]
Read all about the Fulham murder!
A man stabbed to death,
house set afire.
Is he shouting something about Fulham?
Paperboy!
Yes, sir?
Here you are, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Here you are! Paper! Fulham murder!
Man stabbed to death in Fulham!
Read all about
the Fulham murder!
Fulham.
Isn't that where you were?
Could I have done this?
Oh, no.
Barbara... something's happened lately.
These moods are getting deeper and longer.
I mean, 24 hours.
Barbara, I'm going to Scotland Yard.
- To the police?
- No.
I know of someone there, a Dr. Middleton.
My own doctor suggested him.
He's very brilliant with new ideas about the mind.
I think he may be able to help me.
I've got to go to see him now.
- If you go, I'll go with you.
- No.
Please, George.
I want to.
All my life I've had
black little moods... but just for a minute or two.
I've never known anything like the one I've just had... and certainly nothing that's lasted a whole day.
Have you been working very hard?
He works day and night.
You see, he's writing a concerto,
and I'm sure he wouldn't eat sometimes...
if our housekeeper
didn't send meals across to him.
[George]
What I really want to know is... would I be likely to do anything criminal during one of these moods?
What makes you ask that?
This man was stabbed.
And when I came to myself...
I found this in my pocket.
There was blood on my coat.
The blood came from the cut on his head, didn't it?
What do you think sends you into these moods?
When I'm tense or... or worked up... then any discordant sound seems to do it.
I never remember
anything afterwards... except that I have an odd sensation... like the memory of an ache... here.
He couldn't have done anything criminal, could he?
We'll determine that very quickly.
I want a specimen of your blood, if you don't mind.
I'll make some preliminary tests here... and then I'll go out to the antique shop and make a further examination.
- Shall I wait here?
- No, you can go home, Mr. Bone.
I live close to you, and if everything's all right...
I'll call later and set your mind at rest.
That would be very kind of you.
We should know all about it in a couple of hours.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Dr. Middleton.
- Good-bye.
Superintendent Clay, could you spare a moment?
If you have a couple of
plainclothesmen available...
I've just had someone here
I think should be followed... in connection with that Fulham case.
[Clock Chimes]
I don't think
I can wait any longer.
Well, I'll see you home.
Perhaps Dr. Middleton will come in the morning.
I wonder what delayed him.
Sometimes these things take longer than one expects.
I'm sure everything's all right.
[Knocking On Door]
Oh, come in, Doctor.
Well, here's your coat,
Mr. Bone.
You can clean the blood off because it's entirely your own.
Here's your dagger.
I subjected it to every test known to Scotland Yard.
I examined it chemically for blood stains and microscopically for fibers.
What did you find?
I found no fibers that matched the dead man's clothing... and no trace of his or anybody else's blood.
Then George had absolutely nothing to do with the murder.
Well, I didn't say that.
But I can tell you this... if Mr. Bone had done it, we wouldn't be able to prove it.
As a matter of fact, the antique dealer was... a well-known crook and dealer in stolen goods.
The official Scotland Yard opinion is that one of his accomplices did him in...
and then set fire to the house
to conceal his crime.
I was afraid I'd done it.
I had a couple of plainclothesmen following you, just in case.
I've sent them back to the Yard.
I've been thinking about these moods of yours, Mr. Bone.
The mind is a delicate mechanism.
Now, if a man lives completely within himself... if he upsets the normal balance between work and play... the mind may rebel.
Without conscious knowledge or volition... it may cause him to do strange things, even dangerous things.
Now, that's what I think is happening to you.
There must be something one can do.
Yes, there is.
I suggest that you get away from your music...
as often as you can.
Find some new emotional outlet.
Go out among ordinary, everyday people.
See how they live, learn how they work...
and above all,
learn how they play.
But, Dr. Middleton... music is the most important thing in the world to me.
No, Mr. Bone.
The most important thing is your life.
Now follow my advice.
- I'll see that he does, Doctor.
- And she will.
- Good night, Mr. Bone.
- Good night, Doctor, and thank you very much.
George, I really should be going.
Perhaps I can see you home.
Thank you, but I live just across the square.
It's only a few steps.
I can make a few steps go an awfully long way.
It's dreadful this should happen to George.
He's such a wonderful person.
But he's so helpless.
He really does have a very great talent.
He's helped me enormously to improve my piano technique.
Indeed.
You know, George has been so depressed about his... lapses.
- Are they really dangerous?
- They could be.
When he goes into one of his moods... his subconscious mind has control.
There's nothing especially dangerous about that.
But if his condition at the time is aggravated by excessive concentration... he'll have an urge to destroy anything that stands in his way.
So you see how important it is for him to follow my advice.
Yes. I'm sure you've done a lot for him.
[Accordion]
[Crowd Laughing]
Have you seen Joe
Where the dickens can he be
Have you seen Joe
No, where on earth is he
Harry's here, and Larry's here and Jerry, Jack and Jim
ButJoe has flew the coop
We ain't seen hide nor hair of him
Have you seen Joe
Joe has vanished in thin air
Have you seen Joe
No, he ain't anywhere
Last time he was here he said
Let's have another drink
So I know, and you know
Joe is in the clink
The clink, the clink
the clink, the clink, the clink, the clink
- The clink
- Methink, methink, methink
Methink thatJoe
is in the clink
Have you seen Joe
Joe has vanished in thin air
- Have you seen Joe
- No, he ain't anywhere
Last time he was here he said
Let's have another drink
So I know and you know
Joe is in the clink
Oh! Saucy with the goods, ain't she?
[Applause, Laughter]
- They want another song.
- I haven't got another one.
- Sing anything.
- I've sung two. That'll be a guinea.
All right, I'll pay in a minute.
- Hello, George.
- Hello, Micky.
- Eddie Bates!
- [Cheering]
There you are.
Good night.
Why do they wake me up so early in the morning
Oh, to sleep a minute more
Till they rattle on me door
- There now, you did very well.
- In front of that audience?
- Now, now, now.
- "Have you seen Joe?"
I'll get somewhere with that, won't I?
They're a difficult audience.
You held them every minute.
They know what they like.
They liked you.
- Well, I didn't like them.
- All the same, you were very good.
- I thought you were wonderful.
- Oh, this is George Bone.
- Netta Longdon.
- How do you do?
Netta's just moved into the square.
He writes music.
- Songs?
- No, I'm afraid not.
Oh, no, symphonies.
Classic stuff.
- How about another drink, Micky?
- Right you are.
When I heard you singing in there,
I got an idea for a sort of tune.
May I play it for you?
[Melodious]
Listen. That's good.
Is he important?
He's a well-known composer.
He's quite important.
Mm-hmm.
- If you had some words, you could sing that.
- Uh-huh.
Say, I've got a lyric that would fit that.
Do you remember?
- What?
- "All For You."
All for you
I've changed my way of living
- My way of loving too
- [Humming]
Come what may
My love will be all for you
Oh, but that's perfect!
That suits my voice exactly.
- I brought you a drink.
- Oh, thank you.
You wouldn't care to work that up into a song for me, would you?
Well, I could try.
Oh, I'd be awfully grateful,
Mr. Bone.
- [Micky Humming]
- [Laughing]
[Netta]
Oh, George! You all right?
- Huh?
- I'm afraid... afraid I'm a bit squiffed.
You're all right.
You're all right, old boy.
You wrote a darn good song.
- [Micky Humming]
- Oh! Oh, Micky. Come on!
[Laughing]
Well, this is where I live.
Oh, that woman has turned out my cat again.
Oh, you poor kitty out in the cold.
The landlady won't let me keep her in the apartment. What am I going to do?
- Give her to me.
- No, no. I'll look after her.
And then you can come around anytime you wish to see her.
- [Meowing]
- That's awful nice of you, George.
What a head I'm going to have tomorrow.
I shall call for you in the morning, and we'll walk round the square together.
You don't know, Netta.
You're a newcomer here.
But three times round the square, and a drink at the pub...
- That's the local recipe for a hangover.
- Oh.
- Good night, Netta.
- Good night.
- Good night, old boy. So glad to have met you.
- Good night.
Good night, Micky.
- [Bells Tolling]
- [Humming]
- Good night, George.
- Good night, Netta.
[Bell Tolls]
[Tolling Continues]
I sold it!
Netta, I sold it!
- Sold what?
- The song, the one George wrote in the pub.
- "All For You."
- Wonderful, Micky!
Meyer's going to publish it.
I got a check for the advance royalties.
They're sending George his direct.
- But I cashed ours.
- How much?
Fifty guineas!
Half for you, and half for me.
Fifty guineas! Well!
That made him worth playing up to, didn't it?
Well, thank heavens
I shan't have to do that anymore.
- What do you mean?
- Oh, George bores me sick.
It's not just because of this one song.
We've struck a gold mine.
You can get other songs out of him.
Oh, I see what you mean.
You stick to him and his music and then you really will get somewhere.
- This is just the beginning.
- You're right, Micky.
You're very right.
Come on. Let's celebrate.
I want you to come and meet a friend of mine, Eddie Carstairs.
Oh, I'm sorry I can't.
George is taking me to Perrier's.
Oh. Where'd he take you last night?
- Romano's.
- And Frascati's the night before.
I don't see what you've got to complain of.
I always have to sit through one of those dreadful symphonies afterwards.
Well, it's worth it.
Romano's and Frascati's and now Perrier's.
Our little Netta is coming up in the world.
Our little Netta is not even started yet.
Micky, come and hook me up, will you, dear?
And, uh... And then, darling,
I think you'd better go... because he's coming over to fetch me as soon as he's ready.
[Meowing]
Are you hungry, hmm?
- [Knocking]
- Come in.
George... would you like to come with us to the philharmonic?
Why, you're all dressed.
Father's waiting with a carriage, if you'd like to come.
I'm sorry.
I have another engagement.
Oh. I see.
Well, good night.
Good night.
[Orchestra]
- Are you with me or with somebody else?
- What?
All evening you seem to have been watching for someone.
Oh, no.
I was just seeing who's here.
- Coffee, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
Oh, uh, let's have coffee in the lounge, shall we?
- Thank you.
- A liqueur, sir?
- A Benedictine for me.
- Two Benedictines, please.
There you go again.
Netta, for whom is it you're looking?
No one, George.
I've told you that.
Then stop staring around and pay some attention to me.
Oh, George.
- Hello, George.
- Hello, Micky.
Oh, hello!
- How are you?
- You know Netta Longdon, don't you?
- Good evening.
- Won't you sit down and have a drink with us?
Oh, George, this is Mr. Carstairs... the junior member of Carstairs and Carstairs, the famous theatrical producers.
- How do you do?
- This is George Bone.
- How do you do? Please sit down.
- Thank you.
George Harvey Bone, the composer.
He wrote that song
I wanted to sing for you.
Yes, George Bone.
I heard your "Springtime Sonata," a fine piece of music. You write popular things too?
- I've put music to some of Micky's lyrics.
- Oh.
Oh, Mr. Carstairs...
I do wish you could hear some of George's songs.
- I'd be glad to sometime.
- He has the most marvelous new one.
Let me sing it for you tonight.
I'm sorry, but Micky and I have to dine, then go to Ruffini's. Come to the office tomorrow.
- I hope you'll come too, sir.
- Thank you.
- Good night, Mr. Bone.
- Good night!
- This way, Mr. Carstairs.
- Good night, Micky.
Good night, Micky.
Let's go, shall we?
- Where to, a show?
- It's a little late for that. I have an idea.
Why don't you come to hear a symphony with me at the philharmonic?
We'd just catch it.
I'll telephone to the house manager.
I'm sure he'd save seats for us.
All right, George.
That'll be lovely. Go on.
Good. I'll be right back.
- You said you were going to Ruffini's, didn't you?
- Yes, that's right.
- They have guest singers there, don't they?
- Right.
I'm sure they'd let me sing if you'd ask them.
I'm afraid that even the guest singers rehearse with the orchestra first.
- She only needs a pianist and I can play for her.
- Right you are, Micky.
It wouldn't do you justice, my dear.
I'll chance that. Please let me meet you there just in case there is a chance.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Then I'll go home and change. I'll meet you at Ruffini's about... about midnight.
I can't stop you from doing that, of course.
- I hope I'm not being a nuisance.
- You are.
But I rather like it.
- I'll, uh, see you there then.
- Hmm.
Good-bye.
- Ring off, sir. Ring off.
- What?
Turn the handle like this, sir.
Three times.
- That's called ringing off, sir.
- Thank you very much.
Oh, it's all right.
I've got the tickets.
Oh, George.
I've got the most dreadful headache.
You mean you don't want to come with me?
I do, darling,
I want to terribly, but...
I am so tired and my head is...
Would you mind terribly taking me home?
- Of course not, Netta.
- Thank you, George.
- Cab, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
- Here you are.
- Thank you, sir.
George.
You're cross with me.
- No, I'm not.
- But you are.
I can tell by the tone of your voice.
Don't be so far away.
If I've upset you, I'm sorry.
It's all right, Netta.
George.
Make me comfortable.
[Sighs]
Mmm.
- George.
- Hmm?
Do you remember that other lyric of Micky's... the one you're working on?
- You mean "So Close To Paradise"?
- Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm. Why?
Oh, this just... made me think of it.
So close to paradise
We could reach out and gather a star
So close
Oh, it's lovely, George.
It's lovely when you sing it.
When will you finish it?
Mmm, soon.
Maybe tomorrow.
Could you finish it tonight, while I'm resting, I mean?
Well, I guess I could.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while.
But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta.
It wouldn't matter how late, George.
[Knocks]
- Who is it?
- It's I, George.
I've just finished it.
You said to bring it over.
May I come in and play it to you?
Well, it's... it's awfully late, George.
But you said it didn't matter how late.
Well, darling, I've just been asleep.
I'll just look at it.
But I've... I've worked awfully hard to finish it.
I really would like to play it over for you.
Really, George.
I have got such a head.
You have no idea.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is there anything I can get for you?
No, I just want to be quiet.
Thanks for coming over.
I'll see you in the morning, darling.
- Good night.
- Good night, Netta.
[Whistles]
Send for a cab, will you?
Thank you.
[Bells Tolling]
Blimey, but it's hot.
[Hoofbeats Approaching]
I'm watching out for a load of gas pipe.
They delivered it to the wrong hole.
They gotta fetch that there gas pipe here sometime tonight... or the men won't be able to start working in the morning.
Netta. I thought you weren't well.
Where are you going?
To Ruffini's.
They need a guest singer.
- You said you had a headache.
- I can't miss this opportunity.
Carstairs sent me a message not 10 minutes ago.
You couldn't have dressed like this in 10 minutes.
You must've been practically ready when I spoke to you just now.
Sometimes you can be an awful bore.
- I'm going with you.
- No.
- There's George.
- Oh.
Come later, if you like, when you're in a better temper, darling.
Drive on.
George.
George!
Aren't you rather letting yourself down?
If I am, isn't that my own affair?
Not entirely.
Because you're letting me down too.
I wish you'd stop badgering me about that concerto.
And I wish you'd realize what's happening to you.
Have you considered that I may prefer what I'm doing?
To waste your talent on someone with no real ability... and even less reputation?
You'll kill your inspiration, and you'll be left flat.
Exactly as you were left just now.
Good night, George.
[Crashing Continues]
[Woman]
What happened?
[Man]
Stand back. Clear out. Stand back please.
Stand back.
Stand back there.
Stand back.
He broke a wheel.
Are you all right, sir?
[Meowing]
[Woman Screams]
Search the square.
There's something wrong over at Sir Henry's.
Ain't ya feeling well, sir?
You hurt yourself, sir?
Oh, no.
Everything seems to be falling into your ditch tonight.
First those pipes and now me.
I wonder what's happened over at Sir Henry's.
- What'd you say?
- The police just drove up.
- Police?
- There's a whole vanload.
Well, that's odd.
I didn't see them pass.
May I see?
Oh, don't!
Don't, please.
I'm sorry.
There's a deep bruise on her throat.
She says he threw something round her neck.
It was probably a cord with a knot in it.
That's what caused the bruise.
It acted like a thuggee cord.
Thuggee? What's that?
It's a method of very swift and silent murder.
- But what could...
- East Indians use it.
We've had cases down at the docks.
One of them could've been prowling around here.
Yes, he could've been thieving... and he tried to quiet the girl.
- Williams.
- Yes, sir.
- What's all this excitement about?
- It's Miss Barbara, sir.
- Well, what's happened?
- Somebody tried to strangle her, sir!
Oh!
We'd better let the others know the kind of man they're looking for.
I'll be back in a moment.
This is dreadful, Barbara.
Were you here all alone?
I was playing... because I felt so unhappy about the things I'd said to you.
I deserve them.
I've broken my promise to you about the concerto.
I'm sorry.
Will you keep your promise and finish it?
Yes, I will.
Thank you.
I knew you would.
[Meows]
What's that you were playing?
- Something from my concerto.
- Oh?
So that's why I haven't seen you these past few days.
Precisely.
By the way, darling, how's my song coming?
- It isn't.
- You haven't worked on it?
Not for days.
I haven't even looked at it.
I can't write songs for you when I'm supposed to...
Well, that's only because...
I haven't been here to help you.
No. Because I want to get on with my concerto.
Oh, darling, couldn't you put that aside just for a little while, for me?
I've already put my own work aside far too long for you.
But it's... it's just one more song.
It's always one more. They get stale so fast
I never have time to do anything else.
I won't do it.
But I must have it, dear.
- I open next week.
- Then get somebody else to write it.
I'm not the only composer in London.
Oh, but, George...
I don't want anyone else to write it.
It's no use, Netta.
Why don't you go away and leave me alone?
But, George, you... you can't let me down now.
- Please.
- This goes on and on.
These songs mean nothing to me.
What do I get out of them?
You could get me.
"All for you.
There's not a thing
I wouldn't or that I couldn't do."
You wrote that for me, George.
But you've never really tried to find out... have you?
[Melodious]
Isn't this what you were playing when I came in, dear?
Like this?
- [Humming]
- No.
That's not quite right.
It's like this.
That's lovely, George.
But why don't you do it like this? Try it once.
[Humming]
Netta, it isn't a waltz.
That's not the right tempo.
Darling, it would be for my song!
You can't have it.
It belongs to the concerto.
Oh, George. It's such a little thing.
- Your concerto would never miss it.
- But, Netta...
- You must have been thinking of me when you wrote that.
- No, I wasn't.
You must have been, because that is me.
Can't you hear that?
That's my song.
Listen. Play it once.
Waltz tempo.
Go on. Play it.
[Humming]
When two...
When two lips
Breathe aflame
[Humming]
[Continues Humming]
This is our moment
For gay love
It is mine.
Isn't it?
[Boys Chanting]
Please do remember the fifth of November.
Gunpowder, treason and plot.
I see no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.
- Pennies for the Guy Fawkes bonfire!
- Money to burn a Guy!
[Chanting] Please do remember the fifth of November.
Gunpowder, treason and plot.
I see no reason why...
- Remember the Guy, sir.
- Fifth of November.
- Remember the fifth.
- I'd forgotten it was Guy Fawkes Day.
It comes every year, sir.
- What did Guy Fawkes do?
- He tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament.
So every year we burn a Guy of him.
We made this one...
This one's going to be on the bonfire in Cheyne Yard.
Well, here you are, boys.
- Crikey! A shilling!
- Hey, Governor. You're a toff!
- A whole shilling.
- He's a bit of all right.
Let's spend it before the fireworks are gone.
- Oh, good evening, Yvette.
- Monsieur Bone.
- Is Miss Longdon home now?
- Yes.
Mademoiselle is home.
But, uh, she is dressing.
- I will tell her that you are here.
- Oh, don't bother, Yvette.
Mademoiselle!
Mademoiselle, Monsieur Bone is here!
Oh, hello, George.
Did you... want something?
I wanted to talk to you, Netta.
It's the third time
I've been here today.
Oh, really?
Why, Yvette didn't tell me.
I've, uh, just been resting.
Well, I realize you've had a very exhausting week, Netta.
That's why I waited until now to ask you.
Oh, no, not now, George.
Please, darling, it's so late.
I have to dress yet for the theater.
But I can talk to you while you're dressing.
I can still hear you singing.
"All for you.
There's not a thing
I wouldn't or that I couldn't do."
Do you remember that?
Yes, but I really can't talk to you about that now.
I've waited for such a long time to say this.
Please, marry me, Netta.
I'll work the rest of my life for you.
There's nothing that I won't do.
I'll forget about everything else.
I'm afraid you're a little late, old boy.
Netta's marrying me next week.
That's not true.
Netta... it's not true, is it?
Why haven't you told me about it before?
- I tried to, George.
- My dear fellow...
I don't see how it concerns you.
This has been going on all the time, I suppose.
Now, look here, my dear Bone.
It's going to be all right in a day or two.
- But, at the piano she said...
- My dear fellow, don't get upset.
She kissed me!
She whispered to me. She promised!
"You can have me," she said.
And all the while, you got her.
Oh, George! George!
- Taking advantage! Conniving against my back!
- George, stop!
Are you crazy? George, oh, let him go!
You're killing him!
Stop it, George!
George, stop it, you fool!
Oh, Eddie!
[Crashing Continues]
[Meows]
Good evening, sir.
I hope you're feeling well this evening, sir.
[Screams]
[Cat Shrieks]
- What happened?
- Someone killed a cat.
[Buzzing]
[Chanting] Guy, Guy!
Stick him in the eye!
Throw him on a bonfire and there let him die!
Guy, Guy, Guy!
Stick him in the eye!
Throw him on a bonfire and there let him die!
Holler, boys! Holler, boys!
Let your voices sing!
Holler, boys! Holler, boys!
[Man]
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Stick your Guys on the bonfire!
It's about time to light her up.
Hurry up now. Hurry up.
Get your Guys on the bonfire!
Let's have a look at that one, matey.
- That's a good one! Go on!
- That's a beaut! Take her up.
Lots of room up at the top, matey.
Come on down there.
You'll get burned up.
Come on down off there.
You'll get burned up.
Here she goes!
We very nearly burned you too, matey!
[Laughs]
[Chanting] Guy, Guy, Guy!
Stick him in the eye!
Throw him on a bonfire and there let him die!
Guy, Guy, Guy!
Stick him in the eye!
Throw him on a bonfire and there let him die!
Guy, Guy, Guy!
Stick him in the eye!
Throw him on a bonfire and there let him die!
Guy, Guy, Guy!
Stick him in the eye!
Mr. Bone?
Mr. Bone, I'm afraid I got a bit of bad news for you, sir.
Have a look here.
It's your cat, sir.
Some boys brought it along.
Would it be worth a half a crown to you, sir... if I buried the cat in that there hole?
Thank you kindly, sir.
Crikey!
But they got the dickens of a big bonfire over in Cheyne Yard.
All right, kitty.
No harm done.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come on, kitty!
[Whistling]
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come on.
[Whistles]
Come on, kitty!
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Where are you, kitty?
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty...
Evening news!
Full Mail Gazette!
Missing actress!
No suspects!
They can't find the body!
Police at their ruddy
wit's end as usual!
Sir.
- You coming down with us?
- No, I think I'll wait out here.
Well, please yourself.
We shan't be long.
- We just dropped in again, sir.
- Hmm?
Oh, I, uh... I'll read this through in here.
- Is there anything new?
- Nothing new at all, sir, really.
You know, this is about the most baffling case I've ever worked on.
Women like her don't just vanish and leave diamond necklaces on the floor.
She was murdered, of course.
There's no doubt of that.
Mr. Carstairs told us you'd been over there quarreling.
But I told you that myself... days ago.
Another thing, Mr. Bone.
We're informed that you never know what you do... in these periods of forgetfulness of yours.
Is it possible that you could have had one that evening?
- Well, no.
- How do you know you didn't?
Because I can account for all my time.
After that quarrel
I came directly back here... and I know exactly what I did.
I tried to work, but at first I couldn't.
Then I tore up some music sheets and threw them into the wastebasket.
That made the cat jump away.
She knocked over some violins.
I picked them up, and when
I looked for the cat, she had got out.
She was run over.
Later you tipped the watchman to bury the cat.
So you were not here all the time.
He said you looked a bit funny.
That's what made us wonder if you could have forgotten what happened.
Netta Longdon being missing doesn't seem to have worried you a very great deal...
after you had
asked her to marry you.
After I'd found out about her and Carstairs,
I tried to forget her.
If I'd had anything to do with what's happened, I'd admit it.
I've answered your questions.
I've never objected to your bursting in here at any time as you've done just now.
So if there's anything else you want to know, please ask me.
Then be good enough to let me continue with my own affairs.
I'm sorry, Sir Henry.
- This is beautifully inspired, my dear boy.
- Thank you.
We'll be getting along, Mr. Bone.
We can have our first rehearsal on Friday.
How would 10:00 suit you?
Well, we've been barking up the wrong tree.
- We've got to try another angle.
- You're satisfied about him?
We were prepared to arrest him, only we haven't any real evidence against him.
He doesn't act like a guilty man.
He got quite indignant with us in the end.
Carstairs was the last to see her alive, as far as we know.
I think we should pay him another visit.
- Are you coming with us?
- No, I think I'll look around.
You're still suspicious of our friend down there, aren't you?
I want to see if I can find out what happened to the body.
George, what are you doing out here?
I thought I saw you from the house.
Shouldn't you be getting ready?
I've been for a walk.
I thought you were resting.
Are you worried about the performance?
Oh, no.
Oh, good night.
I've been thinking about Netta.
I can't get her out of my mind.
I have impressions of her, but they're distorted... like memories all clouded over.
It's frightening.
This is no time to think about all that.
I can't be completely sure until I've found out what's happened.
I wonder if I could've had something to do with it.
You thought you had something to do with that antique dealer in Fulham... but you didn't.
- Put your mind on the concerto now.
- All right.
Oh, I got you this... so you could wear these tonight.
- Camellias.
- They're beautiful, aren't they?
Oh.
I want you to know that I am deeply grateful for all your kindnesses.
Thank you.
And when I'm playing tonight...
I'll look at you whenever I can.
And I'll smile at you.
See you in a little while.
Good evening.
I hope you don't mind my walking in and waiting for you.
Not at all, except that I have to change.
I shan't be in your way.
- If you'd like a drink...
- No, thank you.
You think I killed Netta, don't you?
I think it's possible.
You'd like to get to the bottom of it, wouldn't you?
Naturally, I would.
Between us I think we can find out what happened.
I took the liberty of looking around while I was waiting.
You found a use for this, I see?
Yes. I've always wanted something for working through the sound holes of violins... and that seems to be exactly right.
That's why you picked it up.
I also found this newspaper article.
"Methods of Murder by the well-known home office analyst Allan Middleton."
I wonder if you kept that because I wrote it... or because of this picture of a thuggee cord.
I describe where the knots are placed and how it's used.
I wonder if that sank into your mind.
Barbara was attacked with a cord like that.
Did you ever make a thuggee cord?
Did you?
Did you?
This has wrinkles in it... made by knots, like the knots in a thuggee cord.
I noticed a pair of trousers.
The cloth was singed.
I don't know how that happened.
Could it have happened in Cheyne Yard... where they had the bonfire on the night that Netta disappeared?
- I wasn't there.
- But I have been there... asking about what time they lit the fire.
It was about the time that Micky rang Netta's doorbell... and found that she'd disappeared.
The fire was blazing when you took the night watchman to bury the cat.
But I don't remember anything about it.
In the Fulham murder, someone used fire to try to conceal the crime.
But you said that
I was definitely cleared of that.
I know.
I was referring to the fire.
I thought that perhaps that might also have sunk into your mind.
In Cheyne Yard, they remember a man on a high ladder.
He carried a Guy to the top of the bonfire and got singed coming down.
That was you, and it wasn't a Guy you were carrying.
It was Netta, killed with this during one of your lapses.
- You're quite wrong.
- I'm not wrong.
You have vague memories of everything I've said, haven't you?
I'm sorry.
I must finish dressing.
- You'd better come with me.
- But I can't.
- I've got to play my concerto.
- Not now.
I have to play. They're waiting.
Listen, my friend.
You're out of balance.
I realize that, but I know precisely what I'm doing.
The shock of this and the strain of playing may prove too much for you.
I warned you your mind might break down... and cause you to do some terrible, uncontrolled thing.
You can't be blamed, my dear fellow, but you're dangerous.
You better come along with me.
- To Scotland Yard?
- Yes.
- To be put away?
- Well, we'll see.
But I've told you they're waiting for me.
I have to play.
I'm sorry, but I can't let you go.
But I've worked all my life for this one night.
I'm sorry, but you must come with me.
Very well then.
[Orchestra Warming Up]
[Orchestra Warming Up]
[Chattering]
George is very late.
Dr. Middleton hasn't arrived either.
Ladies and gentlemen... our composer,
George Harvey Bone.
I'm glad you're here, George.
We were afraid you'd be late.
What delayed you?
I'm sorry.
[Man]
Hey! Hark at this.
[Knocking On Door]
[Knocking Continues]
Hey there!
Who's in there?
Let me out.
Thank you.
- George!
- I can't continue.
Please play for me, Barbara.
[Orchestra Continues]
It's happened to me, just as you said.
Now I know everything I've done.
You can't be blamed, my dear fellow.
[Orchestra Continues]
I must hear the end of the concerto.
- Well, here he is.
- Come along now, sir.
You can't take him now.
He's a sick man.
He's a dangerous man, and we're going to take him.
Now come quiet. We know what you've done, but you can't be blamed.
You'll never hang, sir.
- You'll be held, perhaps.
- Now come along.
I'll neither be held nor hanged.
Look out!
Grab him! Get off!
Go that way! Cut him off!
He's running away!
Get some water.
- [Murmuring]
- [Woman Screams]
[All Screaming, Chattering]
Go back. Go back.
You must hear the concerto to the end.
- Are you mad?
- Go back!
- [Woman Screams]
- Let me out of here!
[Shouting]
Where's my daughter?
- We've got to get out of here.
- Go away.
The whole house is burning.
George!
- Where's Barbara?
- [Piano Continues]
Listen.
George.
Barbara!
George!
Get George.
George!
George! Get George.
[Fire Truck Bell Ringing]
- Father.
- Barbara.
- [Piano Continues]
- Listen.
Why didn't he try to get out?
It's better this way, sir.
[Concludes]
Two pounds, seven for the Burberry and the hat.
There you are. Thank you, sir.
Did you come off the Ella Campbell, sir?
Who told you?
Who said I came off the Ella
Campbell? Who's been spying on me?
Why, nobody, sir. L
- I just thought she's unloading...
I don't wanna be spied on.
Understand? I've had enough of that.
Yes, sir. No offense, I assure you.
Here's your change, and thank you, sir.
I say, uh, I'm sorry I jumped on you. Quite all right, sir.
You see, I've been away. Have you now?
And where have you been, might I ask?
I don't know. I've been lost.
And you won't be wanting these, sir?
Oh, it's just an old rag. Keep it. I'm on my way to plenty.
Thank you, sir. And good luck to you.
Will you join us in a cocktail?
We can't, Mother. We're late.
It's his fault. It's not my fault. It's my editor's.
You're a journalist, aren't you? Well, that's nicely put.
I'm a reporter. Oh, but you do write features.
Now, Julie, don't interrupt. You're stopping at the inn, I believe?
Yes, it's quite attractive. He says the maids are very pretty too.
I say, Julie, I wouldn't take that bright line with Lady Anstey if I were you.
Mark, do you think your grandmother will find me an evil influence?
You don't know my grandmother. Shall we go?
All right. Are you sure you can't stay to dinner?
I'm afraid not, Mother. We're late already.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, darling.
They weren't so grim, were they? No.
Did I look as silly as I felt? I wondered if you felt as silly as you looked.
Well? Well, she might pick worse.
Heavens, yes. Best blood in the county.
Family, yes. But no money, of course.
Well, after all, our grandchildren would hardly starve.
Julie.
Yes? A person, SirJasper, by appointment.
Appointment? Yes, sir. He said it's oflong-standing.
- Irene, did you...
- Who is it, Cleghorn?
He said his name is Robert Griffin.
- What did you say?
- His name, Robert Griffin, sir.
Well, you didn't hear right. You couldn't.
Show him in at once! Yes, sir.
Why, Jasper, it isn't possible.
It can't be Rob! I wonder.
But they told us... Salim swore that...
Hello, Jasper. Irene.
Now don't tell me you don't recognize me.
Rob! Rob, you old rascal, you.
Oh, Rob, my dear! Oh, thank heaven...
I knew you'd be glad to see me. My old friends.
But how on earth did you... Where have you been?
Come on. Give me your coat.
Sit down. Tell us what happened.
Maybe you'd better tell me. I was a little confused that last day.
Well, no wonder. You were burning up with fever.
Yes. Fighting our way through that foul jungle.
You and Jasper were right behind me.
I remember that part of it. And all of a sudden...
I saw it, Rob. The branch,
I mean. I saw it fall.
I called, "Look out!"
Dear Irene. You did your best, I know.
But something hit me on the head!
We thought you were done for. Yes.
And you went on without me. Look here, Rob.
The supplies were running out, and the bearers were getting out of hand.
Do you think I should have stayed with you and sent Irene on alone?
Why, no, Jasper, not for the world.
It wasn't easy going on without you, Rob, but we left Salim with you.
The only one we could trust. When he caught up with us, he swore that you had died.
You see, we... we had no reason to doubt him.
What happened, Rob, after you came to?
Uh, I don't know.
I don't remember a single thing after I got that blow on the head.
Not until the next blow.
That was two months ago. No!
Why, it's more than five years. I know.
And they're gone, clean gone!
What I did or where I went, it's all a blank.
Until two months ago. And then?
Well, I-I was working on the docks in Durban.
That's where I got hit by a loading crane.
And that brought your memory back? Perfectly.
I came to in a hospital in Natal.
I knew if I could ever get back to you, my old friends, that you'd be waiting for me. Oh, but naturally.
Waiting to hand over my share, my full share.
I've kept the agreement, you know.
Remember how we drew it up in Kalo's Hotel in Mozambique?
Here.
"One-half of any and all properties discovered in the Tanganyika country. "
That's quite right, old boy.
We found it, didn't we?
A whole diamond field.
That is, I found it.
I made you rich, didn't I?
Yes, it turned out pretty well for all of us, Rob.
What do you mean pretty well?
There was a million in it.
There was, but there isn't now. Why not? Why isn't there?
Oh, I lost it, Rob, a great part of it anyway. Bad investments.
- Of my money?
- Rob, please try to understand.
We thought that you were dead.
You were our closest friend.
You told us yourself you had no relatives.
Oh, who cares what you thought? The paper says...
But I haven't got it, I tell you!
I'll give you half of our own money, more than half.
That's not enough. Oh, please...
I want it all! You'll ruin us.
Who cares? You'll take everything, even Shortlands?
To the last penny, if there's any law in England.
I've got my proofs. I'll have you in court.
I'll make your name a byword. I'll tell them how you tried to murder me.
Now, hold on, Rob! That's not true.
But, Jasper, he's right.
A mere half would be an insult. Don't worry, Rob.
I'm not the one that has to worry.
You'll get all that's coming to you.
Now, how about a drink? I think we all need it. Yes. L-I'll get it.
Uh, Jasper. Would you mind poking up the fire a bit?
What will you have, Rob? Whiskey.
Done yourself well, haven't you?
Is this one of your bad investments?
I didn't buy Shortlands. It came down to me.
Like your title? Old and honorable, eh?
Stop being sinister, Rob.
It isn't becoming.
Here you are. Thanks.
A bit smoky, that scotch. I hope you don't mind. Jasper.
I'm sorry I jumped on you like that.
Well, here's how.
Julie? Yes, that's Julie.
I'd know her anywhere.
I bet you never dreamed what became of that picture you had of her on safari.
It was lost. No, it wasn't.
I've got it. I've kept it always.
I'm a deep one, you know.
I've always been a deep one. Lay my plans ahead.
Why not? It's the thing to do, isn't it?
Marry into some honorable family, good blood.
I'm as good as the next one, aren't I? Why, of course, Rob.
Well, then why isn't she here? She'll be home tomorrow.
Hmm. I... must spruce up a bit.
Never do to see me like this. L...
- Jasper, help him.
- Here, hold on now.
What's the matter? L
- I don't know. L...
Everything is swimming. Sit down a minute.
It'll pass. So much excitement.
L
- I'll be all right.
Don't try anything.
L
- I want my half.
L
- I wantJulie.
He's unconscious. What's happened to him, Irene?
The man is definitely psychopathic.
You see how one drink has affected his warped mind?
This is not the man we knew and loved, Jasper.
This is a madman. He's dangerous.
He honestly believes we tried to kill him in Africa.
There's no telling what he may do when he regains consciousness.
We've got to get him off the property.
Yes, I suppose so. It seems brutal, but...
Well, I suppose it's the best way, for his sake as well as ours.
The authorities will pick him up and care for him.
I won't let him ruin our lives and Julie's.
No, no, you can't do that, Irene.
You heard what he threatened.
Do you want a scandal?
Do you want him blackmailing us and persecuting Julie?
No, of course not.
Then we must keep this and take care of it... until he's rational again, and then give it back to him... and make whatever settlement he feels is fair.
Naturally, neither of us want to cheat him out of his rights, but certainly we can't have a madman roaming about... with a club like this over our heads.
As soon as he's able to walk...
Well, it won't do you any good,
'cause I'll come back, Jasper.
I'll come back. And when
I do, I'll get you and...
- Oh, Cleghorn.
- Yes, sir?
If that fellow ever shows his face in here again, send for the police.
- You understand?
- Yes, SirJasper.
I gotta go home to my... wife
Home to my sweet storm and strife
Help!
Help!
Hello!
Help! Somethin's happened around 'ere.
'Ere! Come over 'ere! Hey, come over 'ere!
Move your hands! Over 'ere!
Keep it comin'. 'Ere we are.
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
'Ere you are. Come right up 'ere. There you are.
Come on, old lad. That's the stuff. Get right up there.
My word! What happened to ya?
And if you think of makin' me an handsome reward for savin' your life, why, Let's not talk about it.
That is, not now.
You know, if half of what you told me is true, we've got a case against
SirJasper and his lady... that'll rock this bloomin' kingdom to its foundations.
Hey, we can make a pretty penny besides too, you know.
It's all true, every word of it.
I've got the proof right here.
The agreement, signed with his own handwriting.
Half of everything we find, we... Why...
Why, it's gone!
Gone?
Yes, they've stolen it. Are you sure?
Have a look yourself. Did you look in all the pockets?
Most 'struth!
Blimey! Nipped your papers and tried to drown you besides.
A bit nasty, I calls it. Crooks! Murderers!
If there was only some way I could make them pay.
Oh, they'll pay, all right. Have no fear of that.
You don't think I'm going to sit still and see me old friend put upon, do you?
Not on your life! I fight for you and I'll bleed for you!
Now stop worrying, will you?
'Cause from now on, I'm takin' charge. What I need is a lawyer.
A legal mind, that's what we need, all right. But who?
Hey, I know the very bloke!
Who? Jim Feeny. He's fearless, and you can trust him.
A little.
I'll watch him too.
Sure! Look. Me and him, we'll go marching up to Shortlands tomorrow.
And I'll see SirJasper and I'll tell him off right to his bare face!
I must remind you, Herbert, of the Law of Criminal Libel.
All right. All right. But you ain't going to look very nice in court... with charges of murder and robbery against ya.
Eh, very grave charges, SirJasper, but, uh, we're not unreasonable.
We're here to discuss a settlement out of court.
Yes. Empowered by my friend and partner, Rob Griffin.
And what does your old friend and partner expect to get?
Half. No less than half of what you took out of his diamond mine.
And damages to the tune of a million pounds.
That's what we're gonna ask for, and that's what we're gonna get, if I've got to fight through every court in England,
up to the very steps of the throne itself. Excuse me, sir.
What is it, Cleghorn? Her ladyship wishes to remind you it's teatime.
And Sir Frederick Travers has dropped in.
Would you please ask Sir Frederick to be so good as to join us here?
Yes, sir.
Did you say Sir Frederick Travers?
Yes.
The chief constable.
Well, what are you starin' at me like that for, Jim Feeny?
Looks like you swallowed your own Adam's apple.
I'm not afraid. I don't care who comes in the room.
I have a conscience as pure as a baby's breath.
Now look, SirJasper, how 'bout making a settlement for 50 pounds?
This is me last word. Hello, Herrick.
Hello, Travers. Sit down, won't you? Well, what's the latest?
Oh, nothing much, except our friend here is just trying a spot of blackmail.
Blackmail, indeed.
Blackmail? When I bring a story here as true as gospel?
Well, if you don't believe me, ask Griffin.
Who's Griffin? Some tramp who turned up here yesterday.
- I threw him out.
- Threw him out?
You threw him in... the river.
And I jumped in after him at the risk of me own life.
I don't know what he may have got into afterwards, but he left here on his own legs.
If you wish, you may ask my butler. He saw him go.
Oh, you've got a witness. Well, that alters the case entirely. I was misled.
Grossly misled. Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I wash my hands of the whole affair.
You and Pontius Pilate.
Well, do you wish to prosecute? Yes, I think...
No, SirJasper. Please. Now look.
There's something wrong here.
I'm an honest man. I was inveigled in this by this bloke Feeny.
And Griffin, I never saw him before in me life till last night.
Herbert, you better stick to your shoe-mending.
And tell your pal Griffin to get out of my jurisdiction.
Yes, sir. He gets right out of my house tonight.
Fine. I'll send a constable just to make sure he goes.
Thank you. Good night, sir.
Yes, what is it? I've missed my way.
Can you tell me where I'll hit the
London road? It's a bad night to be out.
I haven't any choice. You look ill.
I'm quite fit, thanks. Are you, indeed?
It happens I'm a doctor. Come in.
Maybe I'd better warn you.
There's a constable after me.
Constable?
You are a fugitive?
- Next thing to it.
- Come in just the same.
I may be able to help you.
A criminal needs a doctor's care... I'm no criminal!
Two of your local bigwigs robbed me. Now they're running me out of the district.
Oh, that's too bad.
Picking on a stranger, huh?
A man without a friend.
That's what I am. It's good of you to help me.
Maybe we can help each other. Come this way.
Oh, don't be afraid. We're quite alone.
My neighbors give me a wide berth.
That's what I want, to be left in peace.
Only to be left in peace until... Quiet, Snapper.
Pioneers have always had to contend with fools.
Look at Galileo. Look at Pasteur.
Huh? Who believed Curie, except his wife? What about Ehrlich?
Mind the stairs here. The steps are uneven.
Peel off your coat. Make yourself at home.
I could do with a spot of whiskey. Right.
I don't entertain often.
But the day will come when the greatest scientists of Europe will knock at my door.
Then you'll be proud to say you once had supper with the great Dr. Drury.
There you are. Sit down, help yourself.
Thanks.
Well, happy days! Well, happy days!
- What was that?
- Methuselah, my old parrot.
Beautiful plumage, hasn't he?
Hello! Hello!
Yes, beautiful.
I, uh, I suppose you think I'm mad, don't you?
No, no.
Quiet, Brutus.
I'm not a crank, you know, nor a quack.
Look at my degrees there on the wall.
Aberdeen, Berlin, Vienna.
Coming, Brutus, coming.
Come on, boy.
Steady. I'll just chain you up to be sure. Come on, boy.
I might have been a fashionable physician, yes, with my brougham and my titled patients, but there was something bigger.
Do you want it? Speak for it.
That's the boy. Nicely now. Don't snatch.
In the name of... What's the matter?
Can't I feed my dog? Or don't you think there is a dog?
Why, why, yes, of course.
Only... Only you doubt it, huh?
Very well. Put out your hand, feel it.
Quiet, Brutus.
But there is a dog.
A huge one. L
- I could feel it. Of course, of course.
And specially trained as my bodyguard.
He'd probably kill anyone that raised a hand to me.
But the dog's invisible. That's impossible.
In this house, you've got to believe what you can't see.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
Lie down.
What a breeze! What a breeze!
Sails down. Sails down.
What a breeze! What a breeze!
It's... It's incredible.
Not at all, if you grasp the theory.
Tell me. Have you ever studied optical density? Molecular physics?
No. No? That's too bad.
See here, in simple terms...
You're an intelligent man.
A body either absorbs light or it reflects it or it refracts it.
If it does none of these things, if its refractive index is sufficiently lowered, it cannot of itself be visible.
Can you grasp that? Well, I...
Well, let's look at it this way. The air you breathe...
It has body, hasn't it?
And yet, you can't see it.
Or clear water in a glass bottle.
Haven't you ever been fooled and thought it empty?
Well, why, yes.
Well, then it's not so strange, is it?
The problem was to find a formula, a geometric expression involving four dimensions... for use on tissue.
Bone, blood. I found it.
But how, how did you first...
I began working with small animals... mice, rabbits, guinea pigs.
Brutus here is the biggest subject I've worked on... so far.
And it... it doesn't hurt?
It hasn't hurt him. He's well and happy.
Whereas, before, it was a tough life, wasn't it, old boy?
A big mongrel. Nobody's cur.
The well-bred dogs of the gentry picked on him. They would.
He hadn't a chance when they came in couples.
They all hunt in couples, the gentry.
But when I made him invisible, then it was his turn. Wasn't it, old boy?
Had them at his mercy, didn't he? Oh, quite.
Made them wish they'd never been born.
Now, if a man were invisible, he'd be hard to find.
You couldn't make a man invisible.
You're just talking. You're boasting! You couldn't.
Oh, couldn't I?
If he had the courage, if he weren't a weakling.
A neurotic with a persecution complex.
Who hasn't got the courage?
I warned you fairly.
I've never tried this on a human being.
Get on with it. I've got nothing to lose.
Oh, if you could just make me like that dog.
I think I can.
And if I can't...
They'll have you up for malpractice, is that it?
No.
Murder. Are you ready?
Go ahead.
Will it take long? I can't be sure.
Will I lose consciousness? For a while.
Stopped raining, hasn't it?
Yes.
Look here. I don't feel any different.
Wait.
What is it? Oh,
I was just thinkin', what a cat-and-mouse game.
Enemy they can't see.
C
- Can't get a... get ahold of.
A man!
An invisible man!
The pulse is still strong.
Why, I've outstripped the immortals of science.
Archimedes, Copernicus,
Faraday, Darwin.
Now I am immortal.
Look, here. How long is this going to take? I can't lie here all night.
Wait a minute. I think perhaps a swallow of brandy.
Here. Drink this.
Now lie still.
I want to make some notes while this experiment is still fresh in my mind.
Why, my hand, i-it's gone.
It worked. Dr. Drury!
Why didn't you tell me? Is there any danger of my turning visible again?
Ha! Not till you're dead.
And I've got a good long while before that, and a lot to do.
Yes, there is a lot to do. Now you'd better lie down and get some sleep.
And don't worry? Me, worry?
Others will do the worrying.
Tomorrow I'll plan my campaign.
I must inform the papers. There'll be interviews and pictures.
I'll be invited to address the Royal
Societies. Run along and get some rest.
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.
I'm no human guinea pig to make you famous.
I've got my own plans.
Why, you can't do that! You can't go now!
You thought you got rid of me, Jasper,
but I've come back.
Who's that? It's me, Jasper.
Your old friend Bob
Griffin. Don't you remember?
What is this?
Where are you?
You can't see me, Jasper.
I know. I know, you're outside.
But you're hiding somewhere.
Cold, Jasper. Still cold.
But you're in this room, Griffin!
And I'll find you! Yes, Jasper.
I am in the room. I'm over here.
But you can't find me, Jasper.
I can see you, but you can't see me.
Oh, I could brain you if I wanted to.
Now you're at my mercy.
I could strangle you.
No!
See how easy it is. He-Help! Help!
What is it you want, Griffin?
I'll tell you what I want.
I want everything you've got. I want your money.
I want your house. And
I'm going to takeJulie.
Sit down, Jasper.
Sit down and write what I tell you!
I've already killed three men with a knife like this, and I wouldn't mind making it four.
Now sit down and write!
I, Jasper Herrick, of my own free will, do hereby confess...
that I twice tried to murder my good friend, Robert Griffin...
You're mad, Griffin! That's a lie, and you know it.
Shut up and write!
In order to rob him of that certain property... known as Herrick Mines Limited, situated in the Tanganyika
Territory near Mongaburra.
In, uh, in partial expiation of my crime,
I hereby assign all of my property... to said Robert Griffin, including the estates known as Shortlands.
No, no, I... I won't do that! Oh, yes, Jasper.
Or would you rather have your throat cut?
That's it.
Now sign it.
Now give it to me. I don't trust you, Jasper.
But I've got you right where I want you.
From now on, you'll do exactly as I say.
"... Griffin... ... certain property... known as Herrick Mines Limited, situated... "
Hey, no, you don't! Up to your old tricks, eh, Jasper?
I'll take that chair.
For heaven's sake, Jasper, what is it?
He's here, Irene!
Who? Griffin! He's here in this room!
Yes, yes, dear, but if you'll just lie down. I know, you think I'm...
No, no, of course not. You're just upset.
Jasper, what...
Why, you mustn't write things like this ever!
No, no, no, don't tear it!
Jasper, let go. Let me go.
He's mad, I tell you, Irene. He'll kill you!
Who? Griffin. He's here in this room!
He's invisible. Oh, Jasper, stop it! I'm ashamed of you.
Get hold of yourself. There's no such thing as an invisible man.
That's where you're wrong.
Now I'll take this.
Oh, dear.
Oh, love should be
Hello, who's there? Let me in!
This is a nice time of the morning to come knocking on me door.
Must be barmy. Say, what do you think... Get outta my way!
Say, who do you think you are, shovin' me around my own house?
I'm Bob Griffin. Shut the door.
Griffin? Oh, I say, what's happened? What's happened?
Have you been scalded, or have you got the mange?
Neither. I'm invisible.
You...
Oh, don't make me laugh!
Next thing you'll be telling me you curl up and sleep in a buttercup.
Ah! You're as solid as I am. You don't believe me, eh?
No! Come here.
What? Have a look.
Oh, blimey!
Oh, it's the truth!
I had to put these wrappings on.
I was causing too much excitement, wandering around without any head.
I'll have to stay with you.
You're the only man I can trust.
Where do you think you're going? Oh, I'm not going out.
I'm just, uh, locking the door so nobody can come in.
Hurry up and get me some breakfast. I'm hungry.
Yes.
Right away.
I'm very sorry, but I have nothing but a very old moldy pancake to offer you.
Look, eh, why don't you go down to the inn?
They have a very nice breakfast down there. Two kinds of jam and a bit of fish.
Hurry up with the pancakes.
Pancake, eh? Right-o, pancake.
Well, this flour here is a bit wormy. Do you mind? No.
Oh.
All right, here we go. Pancake, huh? Uh...
Oh, I say, look 'ere.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk!
There's been a mouse in it.
Sounds as if you don't want to serve me.
Oh, not at all! I'm very happy to do it. Very happy!
Here. Could you...
W
- Would you mind puttin' this bag over your head?
I'm afraid you're gonna catch cold.
Here. See here!
Maybe this'll convince you I have a head.
When I put something on it, you can see it. Now watch.
- How's that?
- Blimey!
Y- Y-You're the dead spit of yourself!
All right, now stop your chattering and get my breakfast.
Yes, sir, right away.
And, eh... Er, oh, uh...
You know, I'm very happy to have you here, but, I'm sorry to tell you, you can't stay.
- Why not?
- Well, I'll tell ya.
This time tomorrow, I'll have no roof over me head.
I'm losin' this place for the want of me rent.
- I'll get you the rent.
- Oh, I don't want you to bother about it.
I'll get you more than the rent.
I'll get you money, power, the chance to hurt people the way they've hurt you.
Just you wait till tonight.
You'd be laughing through to the other side of your whiskers, Tom Meadow, if you'd seen what I seen.
And what might that be, Jem Yarrow?
I seen him myself last night on the road.
A suit of clothes walking, and a hat.
And he hadn't got no head nor hands.
I'm sorry. I thought you came in ahead of me.
Well, I didn't. There you are.
I wish you wouldn't move around so much. I can't tell where you are.
Lead the way, will you? Then I can't trip.
Thank you.
Hello, Herbert. Hello, Will.
Hey, Herbert. Here. Huh?
Yes? Ain't you afeared to be out at night, walking streets alone? Alone?
What makes you thinks I'm alone? Ow!
Oh, dear. Oh, 'struth. Oh, my arm.
Must have a touch of gout. Gout?
Yes. Oh, drinkin' too much port, no doubt.
Hello, Herbie. Hello, hello.
A half a pint of bitters, will you? Half a pint of bitters.
Yeah. Oh, Herbert.
Yes? On your way over to the thickets, did you see anything of a headless corpse?
A headless corpse?
Yes! L... Oh.
Oh, no, no, no. That's just imagination. Oh, imagination.
There be no such thing as a headless corpse.
Oh, don't believe it, eh?
Well, chap from London believes... and asked me all about it.
And me too. He wrote about it, he did.
Making game here, that's what he was doing.
Oh. Well, tell him to his face. Yonder he's coming.
How are you, Bill? Hi,
Meadows. Hello, Mr. Foster.
Hello. How are you? Spot of brandy, please, Maud.
Did you find the postmistress, Mr. Foster?
Yes, thanks. She opened up the post office, and I got my story to London.
Sending off a story, Mr. Foster? I thought you was up here for a holiday.
Well, I couldn't pass up a story about an invisible man.
Why, it's better than the monster of Loch Ness.
Well... Say, that's funny.
Accidents will happen.
I didn't even touch it.
Oh, you must have. There.
Think nothing of it.
I wish I was home.
Mr. Foster. Yes, Gray?
Excuse me, sir. Miss Julie says there won't be an answer.
All right. Thank you, sir.
She's not for you, Foster.
Who said that?
Not me, not me. I said nothing.
That's funny. I must be hearing things.
It's getting so I'm believing my own stories.
Well, cheerio.
Good night, all. Good night.
That does it.
Two half-and-halfs and a pint of bitters.
There you are, Neddy. Yours, if you want it.
Where's a chap can play a game with me and make it worth my while?
I'll play you, Ned Towle.
You will, will you?
Whatever gave you notion you can throw a dart?
Oh, I didn't...
Oh, it's one of me hidden talents.
There you are, then. Eh? Oh, now, thank you.
Well, I-I... I don't think these points are sharp enough.
You know? You don't, eh?
No. Get on with it.
You couldn't hit a barn door with a dead cat.
Oh, I can't?
I could... No.
I'll bet you five quid. Five quid?
And where would he get five quid? Yeah, where would he?
I got it right here somewhere. I got a draft.
Here. Here's a draft right there for five pounds.
Right? Right-o.
Five pounds? Yes. Where's yours?
I never made five pounds so easy. All right, put up, put up.
Here's mine. Here, you hold it.
Who's gonna hold him?
I don't need no holding.
All right. But hang around.
Rob, Rob? What do you want?
What'll I do? Just go through the motions. I'll take care of it.
Come on, throw it, throw it!
All right, all right.
Give me a chance, will ya?
You ain't afraid, are you? Afraid, nothing.
Well, go on and throw it! All right.
The first is a bit of a fancy one, you know?
Bloomin' bull's-eye.
'Tis naught but bull luck.
Look. Any position.
Well, why didn't you throw it?
Rob, what's the matter?
Give me time to get back, will you?
I've got to run with it and stick it in the board. Oh.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. This is Herbert Higgins's delayed dart.
Watch the bull's-eye.
I didn't think he could do it. Strike me pink.
Another blinking bull's-eye!
I know, I know. I don't even have to look.
Here, watch this one.
All the way around me napper.
It's bleedin' hypnotism, that's what it is.
Oh, hypnotism, eh?
Ah, get him. Here.
I resent that remark. I'm a honest man, I am.
Oh, yes? Let's see them darts.
What's the matter? A dart's a dart, ain't it?
They're all the same, Neddy. There you are.
Now are you satisfied? Why, yes, I...
Well, all right. You wanna bet another five pounds? Well, n...
Come on, talk fast. Well, no, I...
I'll be satisfied with the five quid I'm gonna win.
You hopes.
Horace, loan me your "to-and-fro. "
Thank you. Hey, Jem, here, here.
Come on, give me an hand.
Come on, Jem, come on.
What now? Put one of those harrows on there.
Right on. Come on, right on top of there.
There you are. Now stand back, stand back.
Look out for your head.
Here you are, Horace. Thank you.
He never had a dart in his hand before. Blooming magic.
You're going to have an hard job beating that one. Don't worry about me.
It's your throw, Neddy.
Yes, here's your darts.
Six of them!
- I won't throw against that.
- Then it's his money.
Right. Thank you. That's right. Pay him off.
Good night. Good night.
It's a blasted trick!
No, you don't.
Give me back me money. Oh, why, are you threatening me?
You heard me. I won it fair.
Give it back! You thievin' blackguard.
Thievin' blackguard, eh? I didn't say nothing.
You'll say less with a bashed head.
Now get your money.
Get your money!
Anyone else? No!
I thought not.
Miss Julie. Now, Julie, no nonsense.
There, that's a good girl. How tiresome of me.
I'm all right now. I must get back to Mother.
Now, Miss Julie, you've had no rest, and you haven't had a mouthful to eat since breakfast.
Oh, don't be such an old fusspot, Cleghorn.
Julie, why can't the nurses... No, they can't.
She doesn't feel safe unless I'm there.
Safe from what, dear? I don't know.
She lies there babbling about invisible men... and... and griffins.
Griffins? Yes.
It's all part of her delirium.
Griffins.
Tell me, Julie. Did you ever know a man by the name of Griffin?
Not me, but... Mother and Dad did.
But he's dead. Miss Herrick, please!
- Yes, nurse? Does she want me?
- We can't quieten her.
You should have called me. Wait, Julie, I...
I'll talk to you later, Mark. But, Julie.
Mr. Foster?
Mr. Foster, it's on my mind.
SirJasper told me not to talk.
But seeing how you and Miss
Julie... What is it, Cleghorn?
A man named Griffin was here two days ago.
Are you all right? Quite. But it was closer than I like 'em.
What was that?
Keep quiet.
Get back in the library.
What is it now? What do you want?
Get rid of Mark Foster. Pack him off.
I won't have him nearJulie. But it's no use, Rob. She's in love with him.
Doesn't she love you? I can ruin you, remember? Disgrace you.
Go ahead, then. Do what you want to me.
How could Julie marry you? Why, you're inhuman!
She's for me, I tell you. For me.
I'll kill Foster before
I'll let him have her.
But you're... you're horrible. No woman...
You mean because I'm invisible? Yes, yes, that's it.
If I weren't invisible, you'd do your best for me, wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you?
Yes. Yes, of course I would.
Then I'll be visible again.
I'll be back, Jasper, to hold you to your promise.
Lie still, Brutus.
I wouldn't hurt you, you old fool. You know I wouldn't hurt you.
Steady, boy.
That's a good dog. A very good dog.
That's a boy. Just as good as new, aren't you? Hmm?
Feel pretty good, do you?
There we go. One more and that's all.
Didn't hurt a bit, did it? Huh?
Didn't hurt at all. I told you it wouldn't.
Up you go.
Well, you're just as good as you ever were, aren't you?
Down you go. Out you go.
Come on, boy. Come here.
Been a pretty good dog, haven't you? Helped your old master a lot.
We did a goodjob together. No one will know anything ever happened to you.
So you've come back. Yes, I've come back.
I knew you would. I knew you'd have to.
You're going to make me visible again.
No, that's not possible.
Don't lie to me. I saw you make that dog visible.
That was a transfusion from another dog.
Every drop of his blood. Well?
The dog I took it from died. What of it?
Don't you see? To make you visible,
I'd have to drain the blood of a man.
What of it? That would be murder.
Who cares? Look here, Griffin.
You might not stay visible.
It wouldn't last. A day, an hour. You'd probably fade again.
You're lying! It's the truth.
Down, Brutus.
Leave that dog alone! Don't try any tricks.
We're going to make that blood transfusion tonight.
I know the very man, nosy young fool of a reporter.
Mark Foster's his name, at the Birchester Inn.
Call him and tell him you've got the invisible man here.
He'll come like a shot. Go on. Call him up!
Go on. Do it!
I won't do it. I'm a scientist, not a murderer.
Would you rather I took your blood?
I'll call him.
Operator... get me 117.
Make it sound convincing.
Are you there? I would like to speak with Mr. Mark Foster.
Here, hold on, hold on.
What's all this about?
Oh, hello, Foster. This is Dr. Drury speaking... from the old stone house in Thrustlewood.
Listen carefully. I've got the invisible man. It's a matter of life and death.
Invisible man, me eye.
Whose life is he threatening now, may I ask?
Mine, if he should break loose.
I've got him right here, caught.
Yes, Dr. Drury. Come at once.
All right, sir. We'll be over presently.
He's coming. Good.
I'll have a spot of whiskey.
I'll take it.
- Yes?
- Is this Dr. Drury?
- Yes, this is Dr. Drury.
- Birchester Police calling.
Just checking on a call that just came in from you.
Never mind it. No. No, I didn't call.
Oh, you didn't, eh?
You asked for it, Drury.
I'll have to take your blood.
Good evening, Sergeant.
How are you, Constable?
Good evening, sir. What can we do for you?
There's no hurry. Take your time.
We won't be but a moment, sir. Do you mind if I watch?
Not at all. Make yourself right at home, sir.
Six. Fifteen for two.
Ahh.
That does it. Well, sir, what can we do for you?
I just dropped in to see if you picked up any more yarns about the invisible man.
Chap just called in, said he'd caught the invisible man, he did.
Caught the inv... That's what he said.
He was making game of us, he was. But he asked for you. Did you check the call?
Yes. An old quack doctor out
Thrustlewood way. Drury was his name.
A quack in the head, he is. Makes all manner of unholy experiments.
Experiments, did you say? Huh?
Come on, Constable. We're going out there.
Look. Can't you make this thing go any faster?
I'm exceeding the speed limit now.
You lied to me, Drury.
I'm as good as ever. See?
I'm going to stay this way as long as there's blood to be had.
Right around the next turn.
Rob. Rob Griffin.
My name is Field, understand?
You've been expecting me.
I've come to make you a nice, long visit.
But you've become... Yes, as you advised. I'm visible again.
I'm sorry, SirJasper, but
I'd retired as you suggested.
That's all right, Cleghorn.
You look as if you think you know me. Well, I-I...
Set him right, Jasper!
This is Mr. Field, Cleghorn.
Mr. Field? Martin Field.
And I expect to be here for quite some time.
I know what you're thinking. You're thinking how easy it would be to turn me in.
Don't try it, Jasper. I can make myself invisible whenever I please.
Look here, I never meant... I didn't dream...
I came here to take possession.
Now give me your keys.
Keys? Yes.
That's it. I'll go and come at will.
I'm visible again, and
I've come back forJulie.
Rob.
Rob, for pity's sake, you...
And nothing can stop me.
Come in.
- Hello, Rob.
- Shut the door.
Ah, yes.
Well, it is a pleasure to see you.
And to be able to see you, that's the nice thing about it.
How did you know I was here?
I heard Alf Prouty talking about the bloke he sent down here last night.
It was right after the Drury fire, you know.
So I said to myself, "Oh, that must be me friend Rob Griffin come back to life. "
The name is Field. Martin
Field. Well, whatever it is.
Well, I am pleased to see you're living in a nice home like this, eh?
What, oh! Ooh! How do you do?
Say, you know, we ought to be as cozy as a couple of bugs in a rug...
now that our troubles are over. Our trouble?
Mmm. Where do you come in?
Oh, Rob. I stuck by you when you were poor.
You don't think I'm going to desert you, now you're rich.
I'll give you 50 pounds and get out, understand?
Fifty pounds? Oh, what a shock.
And coming right on top of poor Dr. Drury... being killed by an unknown hand.
Well, unknown by most.
Put two and two together, have you?
Yes.
Would you like to know why Drury had to die? Yes.
I needed his blood to make me visible again. Oh, no!
But it won't last, Herbert.
I'm going to need more.
Oh, yes? Who can we get? I know!
Look... Hey! Here, don't look at me like that now.
I'm too small. I ain't got enough red "corpuskles"... in my blood to bait a mousetrap.
Well, what's the matter? What are you doing?
It's Drury's dog. Well, all right. So what?
Hey, you're trembling like a leaf, you know.
He's the only living thing I'm afraid of.
Afraid? You afraid? Oh, what an horrid thought.
Look at me, I ain't afraid. That dog?
Why, I'd take him by the tail, pull it out and hit him over the head with it.
You would? Yes. Why, I'd strangle him with me bare hands.
Then do it, strangle him, poison him, anything. I'll give you 500 pounds.
Oh, 500 pounds for a big job like that? Oh, Rob!
I'll give you a thousand if you kill him. A thousand.
Come here. Come here. Oh. Yes? Huh?
Take my coat. Let him smell it. He'll follow you anywhere.
Don't worry. I'll follow him.
The job is done.
Uh, you mean you want it done now?
Certainly I want it done now.
Mark, how dreadful!
And you say the house was completely burned to the ground?
Completely. There wasn't even a piece of glass to get fingerprints from.
You mean, there weren't any clues?
Not one, SirJasper. The murderer just sort of melted away.
Mark, stop being so literary. What do you mean just "melted away"?
Just that. I think the murderer was invisible.
Invisible? Who's invisible? Hello.
Hello, Julie. Hello, Field.
Will you have some lunch?
Yes, do. You hardly touched your breakfast.
Mark, this is my old friend Martin
Field. Mark Foster of the Courier.
Oh, yes. You're the chap who writes those, uh... spook stories, aren't you?
If you want to call them that, yes.
It's a good line. People love that sort of fantasy.
- It's not fantasy. It's true.
- Oh, come now, Mark.
I mean it. I've seen the invisible man.
Oh, Mark, how could you possibly see the invisible man?
I saw him, I heard him...
Stick to your guns. That's the spirit.
Will you take wine or beer, sir? Beer, Cleghorn.
Still, the idea offers some practical difficulties, doesn't it?
I mean, well, what would the invisible man eat?
Surely not filet of sole.
Spider webs, more likely.
Charming notion. Yes, isn't it?
Oh, and what would he drink?
Dew drops? Surely not beer.
I think he drinks blood. Mark.
- What makes you say that?
- Because Dr. Drury's body... was drained of every last drop of blood.
- How awful!
- If you'll excuse me.
Sounds a bit like Dracula, doesn't it?
I mean, that sort of thing is out of date.
A transfusion would be more to the point.
What for? Perhaps to become visible again.
Say, that's an idea. But why should he want to be visible?
Read your mythology, Miss Julie.
Even the gods want love.
And... And your invisible man,
let's say he has a need to enjoy what other men enjoy.
You know, you're better at this sort of thing than I am.
And then, the day of days, he finds out how to do it.
Blood. Human blood. That's deliberate murder.
Why not?
What man who is truly great would stop at that?
And there he is... visible again.
He has only to reach out and take what he wants.
But will he stay visible?
It's a joke on him if he found himself fading out, I mean, at some crucial moment.
There's always plenty of blood.
He can be visible or invisible.
Think of the power, the authority, the finality of his slightest wish.
Why... Why, a man like that could rock the world.
A knife slipped. L-I cut my hand.
Let me get you something.
No, thanks. L
- I'll dress it.
He's quite pale.
Oh! You gave me quite a start.
Indeed, you did.
- Oh, Norma.
- Yes, sir?
Ask Mr. Foster to come up at once, please. Yes, Mr. Field.
It's a purely personal matter. Speak to him when you're alone, will you?
Yes, indeed, sir.
Oh, Mr. Foster. Mr. Field would like to see you in his room.
Thank you, Norma.
Hello, Field. Are you here?
Hello, Field?
Hey, Field, are you down here?
I told you you'd find the invisible man down here.
You can't get away, Foster. You're locked in,
and we're all alone where nobody can hear us.
You want the lights out, eh?
So I can't see you. Well, it won't work.
Hey, that wasn't even close.
You haven't a chance, Foster.
It would be easy to kill you,
But I've got to have your blood.
The joke's on you, Foster.
Your blood will make me visible, and I'll marryJulie while... while you rot in your grave.
It's no use, Foster.
I'm still here. Give me that.
I'm closing in on you, Foster.
You haven't got a chance.
You don't know where I am.
You can't fight what you can't see.
I might be in back of you.
I might be at your side.
Or I might be in front of you!
Up you come now.
That's it. Just the way I want you.
There you are. It won't take long, and you'll never feel a thing.
Come on, give it here. Come on here with me.
Come 'ere! Come 'ere!
Hello, Travers. What brings you here? Listen, Herrick.
Alf Prouty here tells me he picked up a man last night near the scene of the murder.
Aye, and I set him right down slap here at this door.
Is that the truth, Herrick? Why, yes.
You... You see, an old friend of mine...
Herrick, we shall have to see him.
Of course. Certainly.
Oh, Cleghorn, will you ask
Mr. Field to come in here...
What were you doing with Dr.
Drury's dog? Nothing. Nothing.
What do you mean nothing? Mr.
Griffin, he was afraid of him.
Griffin? I mean, Mr. Field.
Yes, but Mr. Field is not in his room.
What? He's not? Come on, let's open this door.
He must be inside. Well, come on, then. Let's break it down.
We have nothing more to fear from the invisible man.
He's dead.
And judgment was passed on him... by a higher court than ours.
He's taken Foster's blood the same as he did Drury's.
But he's still alive. Come on, get him out of here. Come on, Foster.
And then? Well, sir, he says to me,
"I'll make you as rich as Gresis. "
But, oh, did that tempt me? Yes, it did.
Oh, no, sir, no, Sir Frederick.
I was then and I am now unsullied.
May I go now, sir? No, wait a moment.
I wonder how he learned to become invisible.
From that old crank Dr. Drury, of course.
Their secret died with them luckily. A couple oflunatics.
That's right, sir. Griffin was always talking about getting back at people.
Never entered his head the dog would have the same idea towards him.
I mean, on account of what happened to old man Drury.
From what Father said, his mind was, well, warped.
It must have been. Warped by imaginary wrongs.
A man fighting shadows.
He's to be pitied, really.
He probed too deeply in forbidden places.
What a man earns, he gets.
Nature has a strange way of paying him back...
in his own coin.
The events I'm about to relate began a fortnight ago.
In a grim old house perched high on a cliff on the west coast of Scotland.
This singular structure is known as
Driercliff House.
Gathered there for dinner were the seven members of a most extraordinary club called the Good Comrades.
Into this unique gathering came their melancholy housekeeper,
Mrs. Monteith bearing a message for Ralph King, a retired barrister.
King received it casually.
When they saw the contents, the Good Comrades took the whole thing as a joke but their housekeeper was right, it was no laughing matter.
For on the following night...
Ralph King died horribly but this was only the beginning.
A few nights later as the Good
Comrades gathered to drink a final toast to their departed member...
Mrs. Monteith entered with a second envelope.
This time addressed to Stanley Raeburn.
In his day a distinguished actor.
This time you may be sure there was no laughter.
These men were afraid and their fear was justified.
For once again the message proved to be a portent of death.
It was ten days before Raeburn's battered body was recovered.
Hum, tell Mr. Chalmers what do these envelopes contain?
In the first case, seven orange pips, or seeds.
In the second case six.
And the number of orange pips refer to the surviving members, a grim warning, hey Holmes?
Looks like murder.
Not necessarily, Watson.
A moment ago you referred to this club as extraordinary, why?
All of the members are past middle age, retired and without near kin.
Six months ago they formed this club here in London and promptly left for Driercliff, the ancestral home of a Mr. Bruce Alastair, their eldest member.
Nothing there remarkable about that, sounds rather friendly as a matter of fact.
The remarkable fact is that all seven of these men appear to have but one thing in common.
Huh, well what's that?
Elementary, my dear Watson, each is worth a great deal more dead than alive.
That's right Mr. Holmes.
How did you guess?
My dear Mr. Chalmers, you represent the Association of
Insurance Underwriters, you're worried about the untimely deaths of these two
Good Comrades.
Ergo these men must carry rather large insurance policies.
Yes, but that's not all.
Shortly after forming this club all these seven men changed their policies making the other members their beneficiaries.
The policy's total are over a hundred thousand pounds.
Oh, it's very enlightening.
You've paid the five surviving members on the policies of
King and Raeburn?
Oh yes, we always pay promptly but what worries me, Mr. Holmes, is...
Whether these two deaths were accidental or not.
Exactly.
Of course I may be wrong,
I have no proof but it seems to me to be just possible that one of these men plans to murder the others one by one.
And collect on all the policies.
I see the whole thing, Holmes.
Bravo Watson but why the orange pips?
Oh yes, the orange pips.
Pips Watson?
Bit of a puzzler, hey Holmes?
Quite.
Most intriguing feature.
Any tobacco around this place.
After all Mr. Holmes, several lives may be at stake.
The temptation of sudden wealth could...
Could, could possibly turn one of these seemingly harmless men into a ruthless killer.
Exactly.
Are those the
Good Comrades?
Yes.
Let me see them will you?
Hello.
Who's this fellow on the end?
That's Doctor Merrivale.
Doctor Simon Merrivale?
I believe his
Christian name is Simon.
Yes, definitely
Doctor Simon Merrivale.
I'll accept your case, Mr. Chalmers.
Watson pack your things were off to
Scotland tonight.
Scotland, home of my ancestors.
A lonely land but a peaceful one.
It's wonderful after stuffy London, hey Holmes?
I say who is this
Doctor Merrivale?
Oh well, if you want to behave like a clam, you have not uttered a word since we left London.
Sorry old fellow,
I was thinking.
Twenty years ago
Doctor Merrivale was a famous surgeon on Harley Street.
Can't be so very famous,
I never heard of him.
Oh but he was.
His main claim to distinction, of course, was the unnecessarily brutal murder of a young bride.
Really?
However, he testified so brilliantly on the witness box that he was acquitted after which he dropped completely out of sight.
And you think that he was most probably responsible for the death of these two Good Comrades?
Well I don't say that he was but I do say that he could have been.
Murder is an insidious thing, Watson.
Once a man has dipped his fingers in blood sooner or later he'll feel the urge to kill again.
Oh gracious me very unpleasant.
Funeral home.
You suppose were too late?
Oh I think your unnecessarily suspicious, Watson.
One of the villagers hey?
Aye sir.
Mr. MacTavis the blacksmith.
Now daughter, don't be talking to strangers.
Wasn't her fault.
I asked your daughter whose funeral it was.
Andy MacTavis, cut down in the flower of his manhood.
What a pity.
A young fellow huh?
Just seventy-two.
Seventy-two?
Flower of his manhood, trying to be funny?
Come on, Watson.
Oh seventy-two, flower of his manhood.
I've seen about forty men...
Can I help you gentlemen?
I telegraphed for reservations from London.
Name sir?
Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson.
We have your rooms ready then.
Thank you.
Sign there gentlemen.
Yes indeed.
Are you staying long gentlemen?
No, not long.
We just came up here to look into the... we just came up here for the shooting.
Shooting?
Yes grouse of course.
No grouse here sir for the last forty years.
No grouse?
Cheer up Watson.
You'll find some other query to occupy our time.
This way gentlemen.
Take the gun will you?
Take the big bag.
So you're back earlier than usual
Doctor Merrivale.
Gentlemen
I've just made a rather intriguing discovery.
The village of Inverness has a distinguished visitor.
Huh?
Really?
Who?
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Who?
I didn't quite catch the name.
Sherlock Holmes.
Oh.
Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective.
One wonders what he could be doing in Inverness.
Have you forgotten
Alastair that two of our members have already met with violent deaths?
Yes, yes, yes of course yes.
Cosgrave, must you pace up and down like a monkey in a ruddy cage?
I fail to see how what
I do can concern you.
Simpson, Cosgrave, cannot we behave like Good Comrades.
Doesn't anything ever get on your nerves Alastair?
Oh dear me, no.
I have no nerves.
Now tell me MacGregor, the present head of the house is Mr. Bruce
Alastair is it not?
Aye.
Grandson of
Donald Alastair.
He was the lullish one.
Gunned Driercliff House in a smugglers day.
Got himself blown to bits by a gun.
Gracious me.
And Angus Alastair was his son.
He was eaten by cannibals in the South Seas.
Very unfortunate family, hey Holmes?
They found Angus' bones.
Sent them back to Driercliff where no man ever goes whole to his grave.
The place is haunted.
Haunted?
You mean ghosts?
Only a fool believes in ghosts.
Spirits never haunted Driercliff.
Five minutes to closing time gentlemen.
Only the memory of evil.
You're wanted at
Driercliff House Sergeant.
What is it woman?
Murder.
Alastair himself is it?
I don't know.
Doctor Merrivale didn't say.
Mr. Holmes would you care to come along?
Yes I would, thank you.
Watson.
You mark my words,
Alastair has met the brutal death of these fathers.
Awe, good evening Sergeant.
Oh Mr. Alastair, this is Mr.
Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson.
I took the liberty of...
Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson.
How do you do sir?
Oh this excellent, most excellent.
Please come in gentlemen.
Please come in.
And welcome to
Driercliff House.
Now where is the corpse?
Follow me.
It's by the furnace.
The furnace?
Yes poor Davis he was burnt to a crisp.
Burnt to a crisp.
I say Holmes this murder seems a bit of a fiend hey?
At least he's consistent.
Consistent?
Yes the deaths all follow the legend of Driercliff.
Well as MacGregor puts it no man ever goes whole to his grave.
Now you will come in here gentlemen, won't you?
Oh thank you.
That's right.
That's right.
Yes.
Yes.
These gentlemen have come about the body.
Why didn't you take them to the cellar?
Oh no, Doctor Merrivale, you discovered it, after all it's your body.
That's right.
I say, you're
Sherlock Holmes aren't you?
I am and this is my friend and colleague, Doctor Watson.
How do you do?
How do you do sir?
Yes I thought I recognized you.
You know I followed your exploits for years.
The detection of crime is one of my hobbies.
This is a surprise and a pleasure.
A pleasure I hope but hardly a surprise.
You saw me at the inn this afternoon.
Touché'.
This is Allen Cosgrave and Captain Simpson.
How do you do?
This stressing business, Mr. Homes, we were all fond of Guy Davis.
Davis?
Oh the fellow in the furnace.
But if he was burnt to a crisp how'd you know that it was Davis?
Well he's the only one missing.
Besides we identified him by his cuff links.
Why don't you see for yourselves?
Come along gentlemen.
Thank you.
May I ask Doctor Merrivale whether Mr. Davis also received the warning of the orange pips after dinner.
Oh so you know about the others?
You seem to be very well informed about our affairs,
Mr. Holmes.
As a matter of fact
Davis didn't have dinner with us tonight.
Had he indicated his intended absence?
No, no he hadn't.
Mrs. Monteith was quite put out about it.
Pardon me, will you gentlemen?
Doctor Watson, what's Mr. Holmes up to?
I haven't the foggiest.
Go on.
You'll find out, my dear sir, in good time.
Isn't there something you wish to tell me Mrs. Monteith?
Me sir?
Yes.
Please give it to me.
The envelope addressed to Mr. Guy Davis.
Thank you.
Five pips this time.
How did you know that she had them?
It's obvious my dear Watson, since Mr. Davis was not at dinner,
Mrs. Monteith had no opportunity to deliver the envelope.
Yes of course, quite obvious.
Where'd you find it?
It was pushed under the door like the others.
Thank you Mrs. Monteith, that will be all.
Where are they coming from, Mr. Holmes?
Who's sending these things to us?
Is there anyone who might have a grudge against you?
Have orange pips any significance for any of you?
Well?
I seem to remember reading somewhere that among some obscure tribe of savages orange pips were looked upon... as a symbol of death.
Oh really?
Sergeant?
Aye sir.
I think you'd better telephone Scotland Yard.
We've never had a telephone at Driercliff House no.
They're so noisy.
I can make the call from the village sir.
All right.
It's not often we have the opportunity at meeting such charming people.
You go ahead
I'll follow you.
I'm afraid, Mr. Holmes, if you don't go with the sergeant there's no way to get back to the village tonight.
Oh but Mr. Holmes, there's no need for you to stay at the inn.
It's such a dreary place.
We've plenty of room here and it's much more cheerful.
I thought we came here for privacy.
We wouldn't dream of putting you out.
Oh but I thought it would be so nice to have such, such exciting people as our guests.
Yes your right.
I'm sure Mr. Holmes' business in the village is much more important, Alastair.
Please Mr.
Holmes we insist.
I think Alastair's idea is an excellent one, don't you gentlemen?
You speak for yourself, Cosgrave.
Come, come, come,
We are all friends.
Aren't we, or are we?
Guy Davis was a friend too.
So were King and Raeburn.
You've got to stay Mr. Holmes.
You and Doctor Watson, we can put you up.
Any objections
Doctor Merrivale?
This is a tempest in a teapot Mr. Holmes but you're welcome of course.
Now if you'll all excuse me I'm rather tired.
Good night.
What do you say Simpson?
Glad to have you gentlemen of course.
Then you will stay both of you?
Thank you Mr. Alastair we should be very glad to.
Sergeant will you have our things sent up from the inn?
Right away sir.
This is excellent.
I'll tell Mrs. Monteith to get your rooms ready.
Mr. Holmes,
I must say I feel a lot safer now that you and Doctor Watson are in the house.
Oh a delight to be of any use, Mr. Cosgrave.
And well if you would care to keep me informed if you should discover anything
I would be only too glad to help you.
I'd do anything to get to the bottom of this awful mystery.
I'll bear that in mind Mr. Cosgrave.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Well what do you make of it Watson?
Well my theory is its Doctor Merrivale.
Did you take a look at his eyes?
Rather frightening huh?
Yes but that might be accounted for by advanced myopia, complicated with a stigmatism.
Well who do you think it is?
At the moment
I suspect no one and everyone.
So it's your theory that Doctor Merrivale is the murderer?
Yes, yes Merrivale.
Hum.
What about... what about
Captain Simpson?
Simpson?
I see what you mean?
Do you?
Yes.
There's a surly looking chap if I ever saw one.
He didn't much relish our being asked to stay here either.
Right you are Watson.
Do you suspect anyone else?
Well of course, there's old Alastair.
And what might cause you to suspect Alastair?
He's too good to be true.
What are you looking for now Holmes?
I wish I knew Watson.
Someone's got a morbid taste in literature.
Or a thirst for knowledge.
Now Holmes there's one of them that's got nothing to do with it?
Who?
Cosgrave.
Why Cosgrave?
Well he's definitely got the wind up.
Fairly begged us to stay just now.
Yes I'd vouch for
Cosgrave all right.
Mrs. Monteith will be down directly to show you to your rooms.
I just popped in to say good night.
Oh thank you.
I trust you'll sleep well.
Oh by the way
Mr. Alastair,
I wonder if you could tell us which one of you suggested changing your insurance policies making the other members of your club the beneficiaries?
Awe let me see now.
Oh yes of course, it was dear old Allen.
Allen?
Allen Cosgrave.
Good night.
Good night.
Cosgrave!
I suspected him from the start.
Yes you did didn't you?
How about a pint before we go to sleep?
Sleep?
I won't be able to close my eyes in this sinister house.
Your rooms are ready gentlemen.
Where's our good friend Doctor Watson?
Oh he was rather tired last night, he's still sleeping.
Yes, our beds are very comfortable here.
Why don't you stop that ruddy pacing?
Your bodyguard's here now.
Simpson, you mustn't tease Cosgrave.
Remember how sensitive he is.
You should ignore things, like Alastair.
Thank you.
Oh, Singapore?
Huh?
Oh the Cobra.
No, you'll never know that one but this one.
Oh yes, yes very good and definitely Singapore.
Right you are Mr. Holmes.
You know you're tattoos all right.
I'm interested in many things.
Good morning gentlemen.
I'm sorry I'm late
I didn't sleep very well.
You didn't sleep very well?
You snored like a pig.
Rubbish!
Got a match Doctor Watson?
Yes.
It's a very good idea.
I think I'll join you.
Nothing like the first pipe of the morning.
Can, can I try of some of yours?
Sorry about that,
I think I'll stay clear.
What is that seaweed?
Havana isn't it?
Flavored with Jamaica Rum.
I don't imagine your very much troubled with tobacco borrowers hey Simpson?
Nobody else in the place touches the filthy stuff.
I don't blame them.
Good heavens!
One moment please.
What is it?
Just a needle.
Who put that in my chair?
Hum.
This is no ordinary needle.
The stain on my handkerchief suggest a certain sinister possibility.
Give me that beaker will you?
Yes of course.
We shall see.
Thank you.
As I thought, insoluble in alcohol.
Whatever is it?
Well judging by the stain on my handkerchief and the milky precipitation in alcohol
I should say it was a derivative of the tropizine family.
Paratropizine possibly?
That's right
Doctor Merrivale, a deadly poison.
Close shaved
Captain Simpson.
One drop in the bloodstream brings agonizing almost instant death.
It's our custom at this hour to honor our departed friends.
I hope you gentlemen will pardon us?
We quite understand
Doctor Merrivale, please proceed.
Thank you.
Good Comrades, our dear friend Guy Davis has gone to his reward.
Let those of us who remain drink to our dead and to that bright tomorrow when we shall join them in a better, happier world.
Wait a minute, there's something wrong here.
If you please
Captain Simpson.
The odor of bitter almonds.
Bitter almonds, acid huh?
Acid? there must be some mistake.
Mistake hey?
Lucky I didn't make it by drinking that stuff.
Well what have you got to say?
Whichever one of you it was tried to kill me had better look out.
I'm a dangerous man to fool with.
Hadn't we better adjourned?
I mean to say that...
We've not yet finished the toast to our dead.
But you think it's quite safe?
Don't be absurd Alastair.
Take my glass.
I assure you it hasn't been poisoned.
Thank you.
Thank you
Doctor Merrivale.
To our departed Comrades.
For me?
Aye Mr. Cosgrave, it says so on the envelope.
It's come.
Did you find this envelope as you did the others?
Aye.
When?
It was pushed under the door when everyone was in here at dinner.
Thank you.
Well there's one thing we can be sure of, none of us could have brought it.
How do we know that she's not responsible for them?
Mrs. Monteith?
It's absurd Cosgrave, utterly absurd.
She has been with my family all of her life.
A dubious a recommendation if you ask me.
Mr. Holmes when do you expect the man from
Scotland Yard?
Inspector Lestrade?
He should be here early in the morning.
Unless he got on the wrong train.
I trust your right Mr. Holmes.
I trust your right.
Oh dear, he's terribly upset.
Doctor Merrivale can't you do something for him?
I can stay with him in his room tonight.
Why that's an excellent idea and I shall just be across the hall from him.
I think that's the wisest possible cause with you gentlemen protecting each other what harm can fall you?
Well then we must hope for the best.
Come Merrivale.
Good night gentlemen.
Good night.
Good night.
I say Holmes, have you gone out of your mind?
Cosgrave just got the orange pips and your letting Merrivale sleep in the same room with him.
He'll be all right.
All right?
But what's preventing Merrivale from killing him in his sleep?
I hardly think he'll stick his own neck squarely in the noose.
Well, I see what you mean.
Well the field's narrowing down, Holmes.
Captain Simpson certainly cleared.
How?
Yes he's definitely been eliminated.
The killer had two tries at him today.
Nonsense my dear Watson.
No one's tried to murder captain Simpson's.
Well how about the poison needle we both saw?
Captain Simpson spotted it, if you'll recall, from about where you are.
Oh what's so extraordinary about that?
Can you see the needle there now?
No.
Well there is one.
Gracious.
How'd it get there?
I placed it there myself just before we went into supper.
You couldn't see it yet you have exceptional eyesight.
Well you'd have to have telescopic eyes to see it from over there.
Exactly.
You mean that Simpson... well how about the acid in his drink?
There wasn't any acid in his drink.
Well it definitely smelled like bitter almonds.
It should.
That's exactly what it was, bitter almonds.
How do you know?
Cause I put it in his drink myself.
You did?
Great Scott why?
To observe his reaction.
It was quite different from that of the morning.
The first was acting, the second genuine terror.
Hence, I knew that he undoubtedly planted the needle himself.
Well why should he?
Well there are several possible explanations, the most obvious, of course, to advert suspicion.
And you think Simpson's behind all this?
I don't know Watson.
This is a most unique case.
Instead of too few we have too many clues and too many suspects.
The main pattern on the puzzle seems to be forming but the pieces don't fit in.
Well it seems perfectly clear to me.
One of these men is picking off the others one by one to get all their insurance money for himself.
Why it's obvious.
How do you account the orange pips?
Well this man has an accomplice who brings them.
What for?
To warn his victim he's going to be murdered?
No Watson, it won't do, it won't do at all.
I don't like the look of it Holmes, muddy waters huh?
Too muddy as if someone were constantly stirring them up.
Why should they stir them up?
Confuse me.
There's intelligence behind this business Watson.
Cold, calculating, ruthless intelligence.
Must you smoke that filthy stuff?
Smells like an old sock.
Strong tobacco keeps one awake.
You better have a pipe full.
We have a long vigil ahead of us tonight.
No thank you.
I don't need any of that stinkweed to keep me awake in this chamber of...
This chamber of horrors.
He's still asleep
Mr. Holmes.
Thanks for your watchfulness.
Holmes!
Holmes! Holmes!
Holmes! Holmes! Holmes!
Watson!
Watson are you all right?
I think so.
It was a close call.
What happened?
I didn't see a thing I was asleep.
Someone came at me from, from behind.
If you'll come this way Inspector Lestrade.
Thank you very much my good woman.
Well, well Mr. Holmes.
Doctor Watson.
How are you Lestrade?
Here, here, what's going on here?
Someone just tried to kill Doctor Watson.
Blimey who?
When we find that out, Lestrade, we can all go home.
All right, Mr. Holmes,
Scotland Yard will take charge of this.
Have a look around the grounds briefly will ya?
Yes Inspector.
Mr. Holmes I'm afraid something's happened to Cosgrave and Merrivale.
What?
The door to their rooms are locked.
I can't get any answer.
What is going on here?
Well I do hope they're all right.
Got your skeleton key, Lestrade?
Yes I have.
One minute.
Here we are.
Watson!
Lestrade, give me a hand.
Yes Mr. Holmes.
Get him on the bed.
Yes.
What a dreadful thing to happen.
Oh poor Merrivale.
Is he badly hurt?
Yes he's had a nasty crack on the head.
What?
Take it easy Doctor.
Don't try to talk.
Mrs. Monteith get him some cotton wool and some hot water as quickly as you can.
Tell me what happened?
He's in no state to be questioned now Lestrade.
Who do you suspect
Mr. Holmes?
I don't know Lestrade but it's connected with the attack on Doctor Watson.
It was obviously intended to draw me downstairs.
Where's Cosgrave?
Here I'm taking over here.
It looks to me that this Cosgrave, or whoever he is, is are murderer.
Well he didn't murder
Doctor Merrivale.
He's still alive.
Yes.
Yes he is isn't he?
Well just the same
I'd like to ask this Cosgrave a few questions.
I don't think you're going to find Mr. Cosgrave, at least not alive.
What's going on here?
I'm afraid Holmes is right Inspector.
Poor Cosgrave, by now he's probably murdered like the others.
Murdered?
Oh dear.
What's your interest about that rope, Mr. Holmes?
I was looking at this knot Lestrade it's a Bowline, much favored by sea faring men.
Oh sailor hey?
Simpson.
Simpson?
Captain Simpson.
But, but now, now, now it couldn't be.
How do you know it couldn't be?
Mr. Alastair where is Captain Simpson?
He's not in his room either.
I looked when I tried to arouse
Cosgrave and Merrivale.
Has anybody seen this
Simpson this morning?
I saw him walking across the garden, Inspector, about fifteen minutes ago.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Which is the way down?
How did I get up here?
Suffering cats what is going on here?
Do you have any explosives on the place?
Yes we have some dynamite stored in the shed behind the stone room.
What do you need dynamite for?
Just to blow up some cumbersome rocks.
Pretty badly mangled Holmes?
Can't tell who it is.
It's Cosgrave all right.
Poor Allen.
Cosgrave's I presume?
Certainly looks like the ring he wore.
Yes, yes for that
I am positive.
Look here.
What was he doing with dynamite at this time in the morning?
That we shall never know.
Oh dear and it was all my fault.
I never should have let them keep it here.
Don't blame yourself
Mr. Alastair, his body was carried here, look.
Observe those heavy footprints.
Yes I see the whole thing.
Cosgrave was knocked unconscious,
Thrown into the shed and deliberately blown up.
Yes.
This chap was carrying a heavy burden all right.
Hello, who are you?
My name is Simpson,
Captain Simpson.
I'm Inspector Lestrade from Scotland Yard.
What do you know about this murder?
Well I was walking on the East terrace when I saw Cosgrave enter the shed where the dynamite's stored.
Do you mind comparing your shoe with one of these prints?
Are you accusing me, Inspector?
I'll tell you in a minute.
Put your foot in one of these prints.
Nonsense, Lestrade.
If only to look at the shoes of everyone present to know that these footprints are much too big to have been made by anybody here.
With the possible exception of you Lestrade.
Look here Doctor Watson, that ain't funny.
Captain Simpson, how did you happen to be walking on the terrace at the time of explosion?
I couldn't sleep and I was taking a stroll before breakfast.
I see.
What do you know about this knot Captain?
It's a bowline of course.
I don't suppose you ever seen it before.
What the devil are you driving at?
This knot is evidence that will hang a murderer, and he might not be standing so far away from the arm of the law at this very moment.
Oh come now, Lestrade.
This knot proves absolutely nothing.
Practically anybody can tie one.
Can you?
Yes I think I can, Lestrade.
There you are.
Well quite a knotty problem huh?
With your permission gentlemen,
Captain Simpson and I will go and make arrangements for the funeral of our friend.
Come Simpson.
I wonder which one of three remaining
Good Comrades will be the next to receive the orange pips.
Orange pips?
Will someone please tell me what's going on here?
Where is that confounded woman with the brandy?
Mrs. Monteith?
Well there you are, it's about time too.
Let's get on with the ceremony.
What are you going to do about this Inspector?
What are you going to do?
Orange pips hey?
The police will handle this.
We'll protect you.
Holmes tried to protect
Cosgrave, he's dead.
Scotland Yard's in charge now just you come along with me.
Just a moment Simpson.
We've not yet drunk our usual toast to the dead.
To the dickens with the dead.
From now on I'm thinking of myself.
Just you come along with me Captain.
Say Holmes do you think?
Shh.
Oh it's you Inspector.
My nerves are all on edge.
Just wanted to make sure you were all set Captain.
You're sure I'm safe here?
Safe as a bank of England.
You're protected from every angle.
On the terrace is
Sergeant Bleeker, out of sight but on the job every second.
While in the shrubbery is the local sergeant of police ready to pounce if the bugger should come that way.
That's fine Inspector.
While I myself guard the lower hall, hoping and praying the killer should come my way.
Come on.
Sounds very thorough but
I don't like it very well.
Oh go on tuck yourself in and relax.
Scotland Yard will look after the rest.
Good night.
Good night Inspector.
All right put up your hands.
Oh well Mr. Holmes.
Ready for your vigil Lestrade?
What do you know about my vigil?
My dear fellow you hold a very secret conference with Captain Simpson and then packed him off to bed.
It follows like the day you must be baiting a trap.
Where'd you find those boots?
In the cupboard.
I've been looking for them all day.
Oddly enough they weren't there an hour ago.
Weren't they?
Those shoes are big enough for those footprints we saw this morning.
Right you are Inspector and observe the clay.
A very particular variety of clay.
Ready Holmes?
Yes Watson.
Like to join us in a little stroll on the beach?
Awe no thank you.
You and Doctor Watson go play in the sand as much as you like but I'm going to stay right here to catch the murderer.
Good luck.
Well if you get nervous you know where we are.
Look Watson footprints!
And they're fairly fresh too.
Very fresh.
Big foot all right.
Got your revolver?
Yes.
We haven't much time to lose, the tide's coming in fast.
See it goes along here.
Wait a minute.
Now he stops to light his pipe.
Observe the spilled tobacco and burnt match, now he goes on again.
Wait a minute here we are.
Hello.
What is it Holmes?
Another set of footprints.
Bigfoots been joined by somebody.
This one's a smaller man.
Now they go along together, side by side.
Now but slowly
I should say judging by the spacing of the footprints.
Now little foot goes up the cliff and big foot goes on alone.
Hello.
Something funny there.
Footprints disappear all together.
Look out Watson!
Great scott Holmes that was meant for us.
Precisely.
Well there's nothing more to be done here.
I have a strong feeling we are needed back at the Driercliff House.
With the possible exception of your own Lestrade.
Blimey they're bigger.
Here!
Here!
Who's fooling around with this lock?
Sergeant Bleeker!
Bleeker!
Sergeant Bleeker!
Sergeant Bleeker!
...well Mr. Holmes.
Where's Simpson?
He's in the... he's gone.
I left him here on this here couch.
What happened?
Someone bashed my head in.
Did you see his face?
Who?
The murderer you blithering idiot, the murderer and his victim, Captain Simpson.
All I saw was stars.
It's your theory, Lestrade, that someone broke through this window and abducted
Captain Simpson?
It's no theory, it's obvious.
Then how do you account for the fact that there's no sign of broken glass on this side of the window?
Blimey, no there isn't.
Therefore, the window was broken from the inside.
Stick by us old man, we'll make a detective out of you yet.
I say what happened?
Captain Simpson seems to of disappeared.
Disappeared my foot.
He's run away.
He really was frightened you know?
That's just what he wanted us to think.
No harm would have come to him here if he'd stayed and he knew it.
I was right in the first instance, he's our blasted murder himself.
Dear me,
Captain Simpson a murderer?
Don't you worry
Mr. Alastair, we'll soon have him in jail before he can kill anyone else.
Aye.
You'll find him like the others, a corpse.
Don't you worry gentlemen it's only just a question of time before we catch
Captain Simpson.
He couldn't have got far.
My men will soon apprehend him.
You know this rather reminds me of a very similar account when I brought about the undoing of the notorious
Professor Moriarty.
You brought it about?
If it hadn't been for Mr. Holmes.
Oh well of course with the assistance of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
We found him Inspector.
There you are what did I tell you?
Where is he?
At the beach sir.
Dead?
Oh yes sir, quite.
Dead?
How did you know he was dead Mr. Holmes?
Elementary my dear, Lestrade.
The pieces of the puzzle are beginning to fall into place.
In what way was the body mutilated?
No arms, no legs and no head sir.
Observe the occurrence of the pattern Watson?
I see.
No man goes whole to his grave huh?
Exactly.
Oh dear.
Poor Simpson.
Well, if it was nothing but a blooming torso how did you know you got the right man?
Quite simple Lestrade.
Sergeant Bleeker identified the body by the full rig ship tattooed on the chest.
That's right Mr. Holmes.
Tattooed?
Where did you know that he had a blinking boat on his epidermis?
Oh uh, I mentioned it to Sergeant Bleeker when he asked me to describe a fugitive.
That is we thought at the time he was a fugitive.
Oh.
All right Bleeker you better be getting back to the beach.
Yes sir.
One thing more Sergeant, you will say that the body had no arms, no head and no legs, was it a messy job?
Oh no sir, very neat I should say, clean as a whistle.
Just as if it was done by a...
Of a skilled hands of a surgeon?
Yes.
Yes.
For Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
What?
But...
Excuse me Inspector.
Please Watson.
Thank you.
So sorry old fellow.
No orange pips.
Here just a minute that might be police business.
Inspector Lestrade,
I must see you at once about the
Driercliff mystery.
Please come to my shop in the village as soon as possible.
Alex MacGregor.
MacGregor, the tobacconist.
Where is his shop?
Next to the inn.
Well I better be off.
Mind if I come along with you?
All right Mr. Holmes, if you think you can be any help.
I think I'll come along too Holmes.
No Watson you stay here.
These are the last two members of the Good Comrades, their safety depends on you.
You can rely on me Holmes.
Pass the wine along would you.
Excuse me please.
Excuse me.
I was afraid of this.
Were too late.
Dead?
Aye sir.
Shot through the temple.
How did you know we'd be too late Mr. Holmes?
Because we were not the first to read MacGregor's message.
What?
Look here Lestrade.
This envelope has been steamed open and resealed.
Blimey so it is.
Poor chap, he must have known too much.
Has the coroner been here Sergeant?
He's on his way sir.
All right.
You won't find them.
What do you mean?
Orange pips.
Why not?
Ain't this the work of the Driercliff murderer?
Obviously but this isn't part of the same pattern as the others.
They followed a preordained plan, where as this murder was actuated by some necessity and could not have been anticipated.
Come again Mr.
Holmes in English.
I mean that I'm beginning to see daylight.
Well frankly I ain't.
I like good, solid clues and people I can question.
Did anybody hear the shot Sergeant?
I did.
Do you know anything about the note your father sent to Inspector Lestrade?
Why no sir.
Did he leave the house at all tonight?
Aye sir.
He went to change his lobster ports down in the caldron at Driercliff.
He didn't return until after dark.
Here let me question her.
Did anyone call on your father this evening after he got home?
No one that I saw sir.
Well tell me just what happened.
I was in the kitchen when I heard the shot.
I ran in and found my father...
I'm sorry my dear.
We won't bother you any further.
Thank you sir.
This case gets more confusing every minute.
We don't know a thing more now than we did before.
On the contrary, my dear Lestrade.
MacGregor saw something at Driercliff tonight and that something caused his death.
That's right.
We'd better get back to that house as fast as we can.
I'll be glad to get back to Baker Street.
Someone's going to get murdered if were not careful.
Merrivale?
You there?
Empty.
That's very funny.
Can't have gone out on a night like this.
Alastair?
Mr. Alastair?
Gone.
Mr. Alastair?
Mr. Alastair?
Open.
Funny.
Both missing.
Very fishy.
Broken mirror.
That's done it.
Seven years bad luck.
What's that?
Mrs. Monteith!
Mrs. Monteith!
Where is that woman?
Nothing like being prepared... who is it out there?
Locked!
Mrs. Monteith!
Mrs. Monteith!
They left the door open.
The door I closed.
Someone moved that chair.
Sand still or I'll shoot!
You're moving,
I warned you.
Done for you all right.
Stand still.
Sorry.
All in the line of duty.
Who's that?
Watson what on earth are you up to?
Holmes, thank heavens you arrived, you're just in time.
They're all around the house.
They've got me completely surrounded.
They?
There they are.
Great Scott!
I'm so ashamed.
Got the wind up over nothing.
Oh yes, I forgot, there was something.
Alastair and Merrivale are both missing.
What?
Oh no not dead.
Well they're not in there rooms.
You come along with me and I'll show you.
Anything wrong gentlemen?
Have you left this here room since you retired?
Certainly not.
I've been reading.
What?
What's the trouble?
There's no trouble at all.
Please forgive us.
Well now we'll try
Alastair's room.
Right you are.
Better try knocking this time, Watson.
Come in.
What is it?
Have you been out of room Mr. Alastair?
Yes for just a few minutes
I went down to the kitchen and I had such a nice glass of milk.
Milk?
Yes, it was most refreshing.
Glass of milk.
Don't disturb him. glass of milk?
He's lying Holmes.
Probably just one of your emanations Doctor...
Rubbish and the word is called hallucinations.
Whatever they are they had you surrounded downstairs.
It's all right
Mrs. Monteith.
I heard noises upstairs.
I thought the murderer must be a prowl again.
What are doing with that cleaver?
You have nothing to fear now.
Well I'll be getting back to bed.
Not a bad idea.
I've had enough of this for one day.
Oh uh, Mrs.
Monteith, please.
The note you gave
Inspector Lestrade, was it pushed under the door like the rest?
Aye.
Was there anything different about it this time?
Think Mrs. Monteith.
Well...
Yes?
Just before I found the note under the door
I happened to look through the kitchen window and I saw a man running away from the house, as if Satan himself were after him.
Did you recognize him?
No.
He was too far away but he was dressed like a fisherman.
Hadn't we better go down the village and find him at once Holmes?
You'd only be wasting your time.
Why?
Because all the fisherman have gone off with the fleet and they won't be back until tomorrow night.
It's after nine now.
Are you quite sure that the fisherman are coming here?
Aye sir, they always do.
A long stretch on the water gives them an awful thirst.
Why the boats must be in.
Here they come now sir.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
Last night MacGregor sent one of you with a note to
Driercliff House.
Who was it?
Speak up please, it's vitally important.
If I did take a note for old Alex what of it?
Perhaps you can help me to find his murderer.
Where did he give you this?
Down at the cove.
He was waiting there when we came in from the net.
What did he say when he gave it to you?
Well he just asked me if I'd take it to Driercliff for a half a pound and I wouldn't have done it for a penny less.
Cause of the sinister legend of the place, hey?
What else did
MacGregor say to you?
Well he asked me if
I believed in ghosts and I said certainly not.
And he said no more do I and he gave me the note and the half pound.
Thank you my friend, you've been very helpful.
A round of drinks for these gentlemen with my compliments.
Thank you.
Watson.
Helpful?
I can't see anything very helpful about that conversation.
All he did was talk about ghosts.
And what do ghosts suggest to you Watson?
I don't know, graveyards?
Exactly.
Alec MacGregor was buried today.
I say old fellow what about giving me a hand?
You're doing splendidly Watson.
I say Holmes,
I never did trust any of those people from the start.
Who
Who?
The so-called Good
Comrades and that woman.
Who
Mrs. Monteith naturally who do you think I meant?
Old fellow where are you?
Who
You Holmes of course.
Who
Oh.
Having a nice little chat Watson?
Oh there you are.
Stupid bird up there.
Silly bird hanging about a graveyard all night.
Nothing else to do.
Interrupting a fellow's conversation.
Got it Holmes.
Help me now.
I don't like this Holmes.
Amazing Holmes.
As I thought, empty.
Some body snatchers got here a head of us.
MacGregor's corpse has been removed.
What?
Hurry Watson.
Come along fellow, we haven't a moment to lose.
What's up Holmes?
Unless I'm greatly mistaken there's about to be another murder.
Who
You, you wall-eyed idiot if you don't shut up.
Who, Who
You know what to do?
Yes sir.
Get going and hurry.
I'm afraid were too late Watson.
Where's the body Lestrade?
Which one is it?
Doctor Merrivale.
I found him at the bottom of the cliff.
Crushed to a jelly by a huge rock.
Good heavens.
I identified by the suit of clothes he was wearing and his watch.
So Alastair must be the murderer?
You're right to the stop of the class,
Doctor Watson.
He killed them all one after another for the insurance money.
I thought so.
Obvious from the start.
What have you done with your prisoner Inspector?
Oh he's safe enough.
Safe enough?
Yes he's in the library.
Perhaps I better go and keep an eye on him.
Oh you'll be all right Doctor.
He's handcuffed.
All pacing up and down.
Just doing a bit of measuring Lestrade.
Why don't upset yourself Mr. Holmes, you can't expect to solve every case.
Awe, there you are.
I suspected you from the start.
Said to Holmes that old front is too good to be true.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Really I didn't.
It's quite natural for you to deny your guilt.
Criminal instinct.
What?
Nothing.
Got any tobacco on you?
No.
I don't smoke but there's Simpson's there.
He won't need it anymore.
Poor Simpson.
Well if Holmes can smoke the beastly stuff
I suppose I can.
That's funny.
This may be important.
I must tell
Holmes at once.
Dear me.
Twenty-eight feet, it checks exactly.
Whatever that may mean.
It means that the final piece of the puzzle is falling into place.
Oh you can have your puzzle
I've got the murderer.
Holmes?
Come on Lestrade.
Where's Doctor Watson?
Oh he went through that very door only a few moments ago looking for you.
We heard a scream did you?
Oh dear me no.
That's strange.
We didn't see him as we came through the dining room.
Did he say anything before he left?
Yes.
He wasn't very kind to me at first.
He was standing just where your standing
Mr. Holmes.
He asked me if had any tobacco but as you know
I don't smoke.
And I suggested that he might take some of Captain Simpson's.
Well he pulled out his pipe and he was just about to fill it when he said,
Oh this may be important.
I must see Holmes at once.
Thank you, Mr. Alastair.
And don't you move.
This wall measures twenty-eight feet outside and inside it's obviously several feet less.
Oh what are you looking for?
Entrance to a passage.
What passage?
It could only be in that outside wall.
Oh we could knock the wall down for you Mr. Holmes.
What you don't realize, Lestrade, is they're desperate.
They'd stop at nothing and they've got
Doctor Watson.
They, who's they?
Get those candles will you?
All right.
What are you doing here?
I don't like to be alone.
Got it.
Good gracious.
That was for the entrance to the stairs leading to the old smuggler's cave down below.
I forgot it was there.
Give me the light.
Oh dear.
Blimey!
Quiet they'll hear us.
Who's they?
See for yourself Lestrade.
Lord (unintelligible)
Well strike me down.
All right everybody, hands up, you're under arrest.
But who's in there?
The Good Comrades.
Oh no, no.
They're dead.
Are they?
Come on now into the line all of you.
I thought you were all dead.
That's what they wanted us to think.
Watson!
Raeburn,
King,
Davies,
Cosgrave,
Merrivale,
Simpson, how dreadful of you.
Thank heaven your safe Watson.
Well thank heavens you came Holmes.
In another minute they would have thrown me in the sea and got away on a boat chartered by Simpson.
It's out there now off shore.
Congratulations Lestrade.
You bagged the lot.
That's all right
Mr. Holmes.
And may I congratulate you gentlemen on a very ingenious plan.
I must confess if you wouldn't have over embellished into the business of the orange pips this sinister significance of the happenings of Driercliff House might have escaped my attention all together.
Your quite eloquent
Mr. Holmes.
And if Captain Simpson hadn't removed his tobacco from the library you might still have perfected your escape.
Incidentally, Lestrade,
I think you'll find that each of these gentlemen has his share of the insurance money probably in a well-stuffed money belt.
You fool Simpson.
I told you somebody would notice that tobacco jar.
A fool am I?
Who asked this detective to come stay at the house?
He did.
I had to the way you and
Merrivale were acting.
Shut up Cosgrave.
Don't tell me to shut up.
You and your orange pips.
You said they would divert suspicion but did they?
No.
You and your orange pips fixed us.
All right, all right, get back into line all of you.
Now come on.
You get back into line all of you.
Now then, hand over that money.
Here, here, here no more tricks like that.
If it hadn't been for the sharp eyes of Mr. Holmes here you might of... you might of shot someone.
And I thought you were my friends.
Such good friends.
How could you?
Never mind my good men, you'll soon be in the dump with the rest of them.
No, Lestrade,
Mr. Alastair's completely innocent.
They selected him as their dupe.
Oh.
It's all clear to me,
Holmes, except one thing, why did they kill MacGregor?
Because MacGregor didn't believe in ghosts.
One night on the beach he saw a man he thought was dead, probably our friend big foot there and was rash enough to write Lestrade a note about it.
That note was his death warrant.
Very pretty theorizing Mr. Holmes but you can't prove a thing.
That remains to be seen.
Lestrade will you pick up
Captain Simpson's revolver and have a look at it?
One bullet fired?
That's right Mr. Holmes.
I have no doubt that the ballistics will prove that the missing bullet killed Alex MacGregor.
It's good enough for me.
If what you say is true Mr. Holmes there ain't a jury in the country that won't convict them.
And so just retribution has been visited upon the six members of the Good Comrades, whose nefarious plan was unmasked in the nick of time.
By the brilliant detective work of Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
Of all the balderdash,
Lestrade hasn't got the faintest idea what it was all about.
I don't know Watson.
After all we know who is responsible for solving the mystery of the Good Comrades.
That's right.
If it hadn't been for Mr. Holmes that headline might have been about me.
Mr. Holmes one thing puzzles me.
What?
How did they manage those fake murders?
Oh elementary my dear
Charles, elementary.
I can explain all that.
Whenever there was a funeral of some old chap in the neighborhood they dug up the body and dressed it in the clothes of all their members, then they staged a fake death and mutilated the body beyond all recognition.
In the meantime, the so-called corpse disappeared quietly into the smuggler's room underneath
Driercliff House.
I think...
I think that about sums the whole thing.
Tell me Doctor Watson, in the simulated death of Captain Simpson how do you account for the tattooing on the torso?
Tattooing on the torso... well I...
Go on Watson, tell him.
Well the tattoo... well the tattooing on the torso... sorry Holmes.
Captain Simpson was an expert with a tattoo needle.
He merely duplicated the poor rigged ship on the chest of the corpse.
I also observed that the design on the torso had been done within the previous twenty-four hours.
Dear me.
What a gruesome idea.
Out of gratitude of what you've done the companies that I represent wish you to accept this check.
No Mr. Chalmers,
I think Mr.
Alastair here is much more deserving of a reward than I am.
Dear me they took me in completely.
I didn't help you solve the case.
No but you did much more than that.
It was your timely warning when you drew our attention to the empty tobacco jar and saved the life of my dear friend and colleague,
Doctor John H. Watson.
That's very nice of you old man.
And by enabling us to continue our long and happy association together.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
I am Baron Latos.
I have come to you for help.
It's 5:00 in the morning!
I must apologize for the intrusion, but travel for me is very difficult and I've come a long way.
I don't understand.
Perhaps you will after you've led me to the basement room of this castle.
Very strange request.
This is my home.
Have no fear, Doctor.
Had conditions permitted, I would have presented myself in the usual manner.
Well, it is most unusual.
I'll explain everything before sunrise.
Dr. Edelmann, do you believe in the immortality of the soul?
Naturally, being a religious man.
Of the body?
Medical science refutes such a thing.
Just as it denies the existence of vampirism.
It doesn't deny certain physical aspects of it.
Cases have been recorded in which the victims, driven by some abnormal urge, actually believed the blood of other people was necessary to keep them alive, became psychopathic killers in order to obtain it.
These beliefs probably upset their metabolisms, induced fixations, lustful appetites.
Of course, the whole thing is of a highly speculative nature, particularly the supernatural aspect.
Do you doubt the supernatural?
I find it difficult to believe that a human being can change himself into a bat, or that by feeding upon the blood of the living he can obtain eternal life.
But what has this discussion to do with us, Baron Latos?
Perhaps a great deal, Doctor.
Shall we proceed?
The Dracula crest.
Yes, Doctor.
I am Count Dracula.
But I'm known to the outside world as Baron Latos.
You see before you a man who lived for centuries, kept alive by the blood of innocent people.
You ask me to believe that?
That's why I've come to you.
To seek release from a curse of misery and horror against which I am powerless to fight alone.
According to the legend, a vampire must return to his grave before sunup.
If you remain here, how would that be possible?
Within this coffin is a layer of soil taken from my native country.
That earth makes this my grave, in which I must lie helpless during the daylight hour.
Because a single ray of sunlight falling on the vampire would destroy him.
Yes, Doctor.
The door was locked.
How did you get that in here?
Since you doubt the supernatural, let us say that you were mistaken.
The outer door was not locked.
You're taking a great deal for granted, Baron.
Proceeding on the assumption that I would take your case.
Your reputation for helping others made me certain that you would.
You could affect a cure?
There might be a way, despite the dangers involved.
It would be a challenge to medical science.
Accept that challenge, Doctor.
But decide quickly.
The dawn.
- Good morning, Nina.
- Good morning, Doctor.
Make a blood smear of this for me, will you, please?
A Baron Latos will be in this evening.
I'll see him immediately.
Well, how are things coming?
Splendid, Doctor.
Increasing the humidity was a good idea.
The spores are multiplying faster than ever.
Yes, we're making progress, all right.
Oh, the operation on
Johannes' leg proves that.
If we can produce the mold in quantity, think what it will mean to thousands of people all over the world.
We'll succeed, Nina.
And when we do, your devotion to this experiment will be rewarded.
You'll be the first to benefit by it.
Nina?
Make a culture of this and prepare an antitoxin as soon as possible.
All right, Doctor.
I am Baron Latos.
Dr. Edelmann is expecting me.
Baron Latos.
Miss Morelle?
What a pleasant surprise.
It's good to see you again, Baron.
You left Schvonheim just as we were becoming acquainted.
I could hardly refuse the opportunity to become Dr. Edelmann's assistant.
Now that chance has brought us together again, I hope to see you quite often.
I've taken a chateau close by.
You're not here as a patient.
Unfortunately, the Doctor thought it advisable that I come here for treatment.
Good evening, Baron. Come in.
Miss Morelle, it will be necessary for Baron Latos to have his appointments during the evenings.
Yes, Doctor.
Sit down, Baron.
Thank you.
It appears that I may have to alter my theories.
An examination of your blood reveals the presence of a peculiar parasite.
A form with which
I'm completely unfamiliar.
It's possible that it may have something to do with your problem.
Proceeding on the assumption that it has,
I'm having an antitoxin prepared so that we can see.
Your new theory being...
That a pure culture of a parasite, introduced into the parent bloodstream, will destroy not only its own kind, but themselves as well.
Sounds very promising.
Perhaps.
But we must proceed slowly.
These treatments will take some time?
Without doubt.
Meanwhile, your visits here should be only at intervals.
On the nights and at the hours which I shall designate.
Is that understood?
Quite clearly.
Then we shall start treatments tonight.
The transfusion.
How long will the Doctor be busy?
Some little time, I'm afraid.
I'm must see him at once.
I've come a long way.
If you'll just give him my name.
Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot.
Maybe he'll understand.
I can't interrupt the Doctor now.
He's giving a transfusion.
How long will that take?
Hour. Maybe longer.
I'm sorry, you'll just have to wait.
I can't wait!
There isn't time.
There isn't time!
Your next appointment will be Thursday evening, Baron.
At about the same time?
Yes.
Good night, Doctor.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh!
Baron.
Mr. Talbot was here to see you, Doctor.
- He was terribly upset.
- "Talbot"?
Lawrence Talbot.
He seemed to think you'd recognize the name.
"Lawrence Talbot." No.
There was something tragic about him.
He had the look of a man tormented by fear.
When I told him you were busy, he rushed out of the house saying he couldn't wait, there wasn't time.
Well, perhaps he'll come back.
Hello.
Just a moment, please.
It's Inspector Holtz.
Yes, Inspector?
Oh!
Very well, I'll be right down.
You'd better come along with me, Miliza.
Go to your homes, all of you.
This is no concern of yours.
We don't have to go home.
We know our rights.
That goes for you too, Steinmuhl.
Whenever there's trouble, you're always on the front line.
Oh, good evening, Doctor.
Come right in, will you?
Go home!
If I find the person who started the rumor we have a crazy man here,
I'll lock him up.
As a matter of fact, Doctor, we have.
He came in here a little while ago and demanded that I put him in a cell.
To keep him from committing murder, he said.
I did it to humor him.
But when he started raving,
I realized we had something serious on our hands and sent for you.
Decent sort of chap, otherwise.
- Name of Talbot.
- Talbot?
You remember, Doctor.
The young man I told you about.
Come in, Doctor. He's in here.
Who are these people?
Get them out of here!
I didn't come here to be put on exhibition.
Come, come now. Take it easy.
This is Dr. Edelmann.
He's come to help you.
Dr. Edelmann!
Yes. You wanted to see me?
That's why I came to Visaria.
In the hope that you could help me.
It's too late now.
What seems to be your trouble, my boy?
Do you believe that a man can be transformed into an animal?
I believe anything can happen in a person's mind.
This is not in my mind.
Doctor.
Have you ever heard of the pentagram?
The five-pointed star.
The mark of the beast.
When the full moon rises,
I turn into a werewolf, with only one desire in my mind.
To kill!
Listen to me, Talbot.
There's no such thing as a werewolf.
It's a belief that exists only in your mind.
Doctor, isn't there something you can do?
Not until morning, when this passes.
Bring him to me then.
Put him in my care, and I'll do all I can for him.
Oh, I didn't hear you.
The Doctor will see you now.
Do you think he can help me?
He's done some wonderful things.
Then why has he kept me waiting here all day?
Doesn't he realize that tonight...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I know he'll do whatever he can for me.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Sit down, Mr. Talbot.
What have you got to tell me?
In your case, my boy, diagnosis is extremely difficult.
But the examination you made this morning, the X-rays.
Examination discloses one condition, pressure upon certain parts of the brain.
This condition coupled with your belief that the moon can bring about a change accomplishes exactly that.
During the period in which your reasoning processes give way to self-hypnosis, the glands which govern your metabolism get out of control, like a steam engine without a balance wheel.
When this happens, the glands generate an abnormal supply of certain hormones.
In your case, those which bring about the physical transformation which you experience.
But explaining it doesn't help.
What can you do about it?
Operate?
A surgical operation to enlarge the cranial cavity is a long and dangerous one.
Then there's nothing you can do to help me.
There might be.
Come here, my boy.
Under tropical conditions, which we have tried to duplicate here, this hybrid plant, clavaria formosa, produces a mold from which we've been able to distill...
Well, a substance which possesses the property of softening any hard structure composed of calcium salts.
Bone, for instance.
With this medium, it might be possible without surgery to reshape the cranial cavity and thus eliminate the pressure.
You can do that now?
Can you?
Unfortunately, it will take some time to produce mold in sufficient quantity.
Tonight, the moon will be full again.
What can you do to help me now?
Only what you did for yourself last night.
Confine you.
No, Doctor.
No.
I can't go through that again.
Talbot, listen.
Talbot. Talbot!
Talbot, come back!
Siegfried!
Siegfried!
There are many caves along the coastline here made by the tides.
There's still a chance that he can be saved.
We must think of the danger to Dr. Edelmann.
If Mr. Talbot has been swept into the cave down there, he's still under the spell of the moon.
We must wait till it sets.
When it does, if he's still alive, he'll try to destroy himself again.
That's why the Doctor must time his actions to the very moment.
If he can find him just as the seizure passes, and his reason returns...
Perhaps he can persuade him to want to live.
Here we work half a night to get this thing rigged up, and then he says, "We'll wait a while."
What's going on around here anyway?
That's Dr. Edelmann's business.
Strange business, if you ask me.
All right, swing me out.
Lower away.
Easy!
All right!
I might've killed you.
Why did you follow me down here?
To bring you back, my boy.
Back to a life of misery and despair?
I only wanted to die.
You want to die, but instead you will live, because God, in his divine workings, has lead you to the very thing which makes help possible.
Look about you.
The temperature and humidity down here are ideal for growing the spore-producing plants.
Before the next full moon, we should have more than enough to help you.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
You can, my boy.
But you must do your part.
You must want to live.
The Frankenstein monster.
That must be the skeleton of Dr. Niemann, who revitalized him years ago.
As the story goes, the villagers drove them into the swamp, and they went down in quicksand.
After all these years, the mud has brought them here.
Still alive.
He's indestructible.
Frankenstein's creation is man's challenge to the laws of life and death.
Doctor!
Dr. Edelmann!
Doctor, look here.
There must be a way out of here into the castle.
History mentions an old torture chamber.
But its entrance was sealed up years ago.
He was made bit by bit, piece by piece.
The undying monster.
Triumphant climax of
Frankenstein's genius.
The heart that Frankenstein gave him never died.
The spark of life is still there, waiting to be revived.
Dr. Edelmann, this thing destroyed Frankenstein.
It's brought death to all who have tried to follow in his footsteps.
Is that poor creature responsible for what he is?
It's a thing of violence to whom death would be a merciful release.
Can man sit in judgment over life and death?
The evil he creates, he can also destroy.
That would be murder.
Think what you're doing, Doctor.
To bring him back again, Doctor, would unleash worse than murder upon humanity.
That helpless body is man's responsibility.
Man's responsibility is to his fellow man.
Perhaps you're right, Nina.
Frankenstein's monster must never wreak havoc again.
Baron.
I didn't hear you come in.
Please, go on.
You like it?
It breathes the spirit of the night.
They played it the evening we met at the concert.
I'd forgotten.
Until I saw you again.
Perhaps I wanted you to remember.
I've never heard this music before, yet I'm playing it.
You're creating it...
For me.
It frightens me.
It's beautiful.
It's the music of the world from which I come.
It makes me see strange things.
People who are dead, yet they're alive.
Mine is a world without material needs.
It calls to me, but I'm afraid.
The fear will pass as the music becomes fixed in your mind.
It will make you long to be there.
Why do you stop?
Play the music again.
There's something Dr. Edelmann told me to do.
Roll up your sleeve, please, Baron.
The music will come to you again.
My world is waiting for you.
Forsake the cross so that you can join me there.
Your world is coming closer to me.
But I'm afraid.
It is a world without fear.
It is like the music.
Beautiful. Beautiful.
Oh, good evening, Baron.
Thank you, Miliza. That'll be all.
I feel that we're making progress, Baron.
This photomiorograph of your blood reveals an odd condition.
One which I can't account for as yet.
What is it, Doctor?
A different species of antibodies has appeared.
Why worry so long as the treatments are proving successful?
If a doctor affects a cure, he wants to know how he did it.
Which is of little concern to the patient so long as he's being cured.
Day after tomorrow?
At the same time.
Then good night, Doctor.
Please go to bed, Miliza.
I'll finish down here.
I think I will.
Miliza!
Miliza! Are you all right?
The music is bringing my world closer.
Closer.
Doctor, Baron Latos...
He left here early this evening, didn't he?
About half past 8:00. Why?
I...
I...
Miliza and I were working.
What are you trying to tell me?
Come, speak up.
She seemed awfully tired.
Like a person in a trance.
In a trance?
She left me without saying a word.
I followed her.
She met Baron Latos in the hall.
They went into the garden.
And when he walked in front of the mirror,
I couldn't see his reflection.
I imagined that, didn't I?
Didn't I?
No, Nina.
Baron Latos shows no reflection.
Then he...
He's Count Dracula.
In trying to save him,
I've endangered the lives of all of you.
Then cast away the cross so that you may join me there.
I must try to stop him before it's too late.
But how?
Prepare for a transfusion at once.
You can't give another one so soon.
Do as I tell you.
If anything should happen to me tonight, go into the old armor room in the basement and burn what you find there.
What is it, Doctor?
You'll understand.
You must destroy it by fire.
Go to your room.
When you hear the music,
I will come to you.
I've been looking for you, Baron.
You remember that I was puzzled tonight by the new antibodies?
Yes.
I know now where they came from.
They're from my blood.
We may be on the verge of an important discovery.
So, to check my theory,
I'm going to give you another transfusion.
Now?
Immediately.
If this is the answer, we must see.
Doctor.
Dr. Edelmann!
Doctor!
Dr. Edelmann!
He's gone.
Mr. Talbot!
Mr. Talbot!
- Miliza.
- She's all right now.
But what about him?
The evil I brought here will never live again.
They tried to kill you, but they couldn't.
Frankenstein gave you eternal life.
Power which time cannot destroy.
The secret of immortality, it will soon be mine.
Dr. Edelmann?
Go away. Leave me alone.
Dr. Edelmann, I have some coffee for you.
Go away, I tell you.
Dr. Edelmann, let me in!
Doctor.
Doctor, you're ill.
No.
I'm all right.
That'll make you feel better.
How much of the spore concentrate have we ready?
Don't worry about that now.
We're making fine progress.
Answer me.
Is there enough for two operations?
No, there won't be for some time.
But we do have enough for one?
I think so.
Then I must operate as soon as possible, on you.
- But Doctor...
- You were right, Nina.
I am ill.
It's impossible to know what the future holds.
There, there, Doctor.
You mustn't talk like that.
I'll operate tomorrow, Nina.
Then you must operate on Mr. Talbot.
The moon will be full in a few days.
We can't let him suffer again.
But you... You've waited such a long time.
Then I can wait a little longer.
It won't make any difference.
You're worn out.
Why don't you get some rest?
I'm all right.
I know who you're thinking of.
I'm hoping we'll be ready in time.
I can't stand the thought of him having to go through that again.
Don't worry, we'll have enough.
Why, it's wonderful, Dr. Edelmann.
What you've done would ordinarily mean an operation of the most delicate nature.
This way, the dangers of surgery didn't even exist.
We can expect some nervous shock.
He must be kept quiet.
Any exertion might undo everything
I hope we've accomplished.
We'll know in a few days, Miliza.
All we can do now is hope.
And pray.
We must think now only of Nina.
Every minute must be devoted to producing more of the concentrate.
For her.
You're a fine nurse, Miliza.
You know perfectly well Mr. Talbot should be asleep by now.
Sleep?
I'll have a lifetime in which to sleep, when I know what lies ahead.
After what Dr. Edelmann has done for you, only happiness lies ahead.
I wonder.
Please don't think that I'm ungrateful.
Time after time, people have tried to help me.
Time after time, they've failed.
- If this fails, I...
- It won't fail, Larry.
You must believe that it won't.
I've tried to.
But when I face the night...
Try to see the night as something beautiful.
Until the full moon turns it into a thing of ugliness and horror.
Soon, you'll see it as everyone else does.
Restful, tranquil and serene.
Until that time comes,
I'll live 1,000 hopes, die 1,000 times.
It will never be ugly to you again, Larry.
Believe me, I know it.
How do you know that?
My heart tells me.
Hello, Siegfried.
Dr. Edelmann!
Did you hear me call to you, Siegfried?
Why, no, sir.
I would have stopped for you if I had.
I'm certain you would have.
Don't worry about it, Siegfried.
What's the matter, Siegfried?
You act as though you were afraid.
Oh, no, sir.
Why should I be afraid?
Of the night, perhaps?
I'm not afraid of the night.
Your hands are trembling, Siegfried.
Are they?
Siegfried.
Yes, sir?
I believe I know what you're afraid of.
Do you?
You're afraid of me.
Of you, sir?
'Cause if you weren't, you'd look at me, Siegfried.
Hyah!
Hyah!
See, you are afraid of me.
You're driving faster and faster, so that you can get into the village and tell the police.
Why? Why should I want to tell the police anything?
Because you're afraid
I'm going to kill you!
Kill me? Doctor!
Yes. You've seen what's happened to your old friend.
He doesn't want anybody but himself to know about that.
No, Doctor!
I will never tell!
That's right, Siegfried. You never will!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help! Help!
There he is! There he is!
This way!
This way!
It's your brother, Siegfried.
Is he dead?
There he goes!
Good evening, Inspector.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Doctor, but I'd like to see Mr. Talbot and everybody else in the house at once.
Certainly.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll know in good time, Doctor.
Now, please hurry.
Now, Inspector, what is it?
Your man Siegfried's been murdered.
Siegfried?
Murdered?
By the person who rode into the village with him tonight.
His throat was torn open as though by some enraged animal.
So naturally you suspect me.
I have good reason to.
But he hasn't been out of the house for days.
Not to your knowledge, perhaps.
Have you been with him all evening?
Until an hour ago.
Well, the murder was only committed 20 minutes ago.
And within the last five minutes, we pursued the murderer to these very grounds.
But it's impossible, Inspector.
Only the full moon affects Mr. Talbot.
The moon won't be full again until tomorrow night.
Not only that, Inspector, but Mr. Talbot has undergone an operation which makes physical exertion out of the question.
Running even a short distance, much less from the village, would cause serious complications.
A cerebral hemorrhage, perhaps even his death.
I respect your word, Doctor, but a murder has been committed.
It's imperative that I search your premises immediately.
He's the man you want.
Are you gonna let Dr. Edelmann talk you out of it?
That's enough, Steinmuhl. That's enough.
I apologize, Doctor, but the man who killed his brother is somewhere around here.
It's my duty to find him.
I shall hold you responsible for these people until further notice.
Yes?
What are you doing here, my boy?
You shouldn't be up.
Never mind me, Doctor.
It's you I'm worried about.
You were with Siegfried tonight when he went to the village.
I saw you.
I saw you when you came back.
Why didn't you tell Inspector Holtz?
After what you've done for me?
Why, you tried to help me.
And you want to help me now?
If I possibly can.
Because you suffered the tortures
I'm going through now, you of all people will understand what I'm going to say.
In trying to perform the miracle of medical science,
I failed.
My blood has been contaminated by the blood of Dracula.
My soul and mind have been seized by some nameless horror, a lust which changes me into the thing that killed Siegfried tonight.
You wish to help me?
There's one way in which you can.
Say nothing to Inspector
Holtz of what you know.
Not to protect me, but to give me time.
Time to do for Nina what I've done for you.
After that, this evil thing must be destroyed.
You have my word that it will be, my boy.
But if I am unable, you must do it for me.
Dr. Franz Edelmann.
Bonn University, cum laude.
What's going on here?
I was just on my way over to your office, Inspector.
I want you to take a look at this.
I found it clenched in
Siegfried's left hand.
Dr. Edelmann killed him.
Be quiet, Steinmuhl.
You don't know what this means.
Neither do I.
It's obviously a matter for the police to handle.
Is that clear?
It's clear Dr. Edelmann killed my brother.
Last night, you thought it was Talbot.
Tonight, you say it's a man who we all have known and respected for years.
Good heavens, you're worse than a gossiping old woman.
Go home. Go home.
Go home, all of you!
I'm sick and tired of this. Come on, break it up. Break it up, come on.
Something's going on at Dr. Edelmann's, I tell you.
What does Holtz have to say about it?
"This is a matter for the police to handle."
It's a matter for us to handle, unless we all want to be murdered.
He's right.
I'm for doing something about it.
Well, I don't know, now.
I'm with you.
The next few moments will give us our answer.
It's the time we've all been looking forward to.
You must put fear out of your mind.
Confront it with a belief that the past is over with, that a new life lies ahead.
A new life.
Stay here, please. All of you.
- But, Larry...
- No!
Not until we can be sure.
Doctor, it's wonderful.
Dr. Edelmann? Doctor!
That's it. That's it.
Now! Now!
That's it. That's it.
I'll make you strong, stronger than you've ever been.
I'll give you the strength of 100 men.
No, Dr. Edelmann.
No! You promised.
What are you doing here?
Why, I...
You were spying on me, weren't you?
No, I just wanted to find you.
I wanted to tell you that I...
You shouldn't have done that, Nina.
I want to see Dr. Edelmann at once.
You shouldn't have come here.
I don't like people who see what they're not supposed to see.
- Doctor!
- He's gone mad.
Hello, Mr. Talbot.
You broke your promise to me, didn't you?
You told the police.
I don't like people who break their promises, Mr. Talbot.
Get out! The Frankenstein monster!
Good evening, Evans.
Evening, sir.
Dinner is served,
Mr. Kessler.
Thank you.
Good evening, my dear.
You're more beautiful than ever this evening.
Mrs. Kessler first, Evans.
Oh yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
Evans, how's Dad taking it?
Alright, Miss Virginia.
They're having dinner.
I'll answer it.
Hello, Virginia.
I told you not to come here this evening, Ralph.
Why?
Didn't you want to see me?
Well, it isn't that I didn't want to see you.
You're certainly acting strange, darling.
What's all the mystery about?
Let's go into the library.
Ralph!
After dinner we are taking a long walk.
I'd like to speak to you, Ralph.
What's come over your father, Virginia?
Is that why you didn't want me here tonight?
Yes.
It stopped me cold.
I'm sorry if I accidentally stumbled on something you didn't want me to know.
Well, it must seem weird to someone who's never seen it before.
It happens once a year.
He always appeared perfectly rational to me.
Well, there's something
I must tell you.
It's about my mother.
I don't understand.
Well, it happened several years ago.
My father and mother were apparently as happy as two people could be.
He worshipped her.
Another man?
The usual best friend.
They almost broke my father's heart.
He seemed reconciled, but he never forgets their wedding anniversary and celebrates it that way.
I guess he isn't the only one who resorts to make believe.
But it does give one an uncanny feeling.
Well, it doesn't frighten me anymore.
Now that you know.
I love you.
You wanted your coat, Miss Kessler?
Oh.
Oh yes, thank you.
I was going to take a drive, it's such a beautiful night.
Come along?
Yes, of course.
Sure you don't mind going?
No, no, I'd love it.
We'll be back in an hour, Cecile.
Yes, miss.
Hums
That's a nice young man of Miss Virginia's.
I guess so.
If he wasn't, Miss Virginia wouldn't bother with him.
Does she plan to marry him?
I never discuss things that aren't my business.
If you want to stay here,
I suggest you don't be so curious.
Well, just the same, I think this is a crazy house.
And what about those murders?
Jules here says there's been a lot of them.
And nobody's ever been able to find out who did the killing.
You talk too much, Jules.
But I only said that...
Excuse me, Miss Cecile.
I'm going to show you where we keep our linens.
Mrs. Kessler?
Oh Mrs. Kessler?
I brought you a dinner.
Oh please, Mrs. Kessler,
I got to go home.
Home?
I want to go home, too.
But you are home.
And as soon as you feel better,
I'm going to take you to your husband and daughter.
But they never write to me.
Oh, but they don't know where you are, Mrs. Kessler.
Nobody knows that but me.
You see, I found you.
I'm running away.
Running away in a car.
We're going faster, faster, faster.
We're going to crash!
I can't go home now, can I?
Mrs. Kessler, please.
Please eat your dinner.
I've got to go home.
I'll be back in the morning.
Good night, Mrs. Kessler.
Good night.
You're late again, Jules.
I'm sorry, Mama.
But I just couldn't get away from her.
Jules, why don't you tell
Mr. Kessler about his wife, that you're hiding her?
Oh, I haven't got the heart, Mama.
It would kill him if he saw her the way she is.
Poor thing.
She'd be better off if she'd died with that man when the car was wrecked.
I guess so.
Jules, I've been thinking.
Maybe she had something to do with all these horrible murders.
Oh, ho, ho, she wouldn't hurt nobody.
She's like a child.
She's still dazed from the accident.
You know, amnesia.
She'll be better soon, then I'll take her home.
But if they found out
I've been hiding her, they might think I had something to do with the murder.
Jules, you must tell Mr. Kessler.
Oh, no, no, Mama.
We must never tell anyone.
Never.
Sure you won't come in?
No thanks, darling, I think I better run along.
Good night, Ralph.
Oh, Virginia?
Shall I put your car away?
No thanks.
Evans will take care of it.
Alright.
'Night.
Good evening, Miss Virginia.
Would you please put my car in the garage when you have a moment?
Yes, miss.
Hello, Casanova.
Have you gone crazy?
The only chance
I had to see you.
You ignored my letters and my telephone calls.
Did you think that you could get rid of me as easy as all that?
Be quiet.
They'll hear you.
You bet they will.
And you're going to listen to me, too.
I'm not giving up for that
Kessler girl or anybody else.
This is different, Cecile.
I never said I loved you.
Are you in love with her?
Yes.
Well, you're not marrying her, understand?
Nothing's going to stand in the way of my happiness.
Not even you.
Don't threaten me.
She'll have to know about us sooner or later.
And besides, I'll make you a good wife, Ralph.
I promise I will.
Guess what?
What?
I'm in love.
With Ralph?
Yes, Dad.
He's a fine boy.
I'm so happy for you, my dear.
Oh, he hasn't asked me to marry him yet, but he will.
I know he will.
Good night, my pet.
Good night too.
Good night, Evans.
Good night, Miss Virginia.
Can I do anything for you, sir, before I retire?
What happened to your hand, Evans?
Oh, nothing, sir.
I hurt it when
I was putting
Miss Virginia's car in the garage.
Put anything on it?
Oh, the bandage.
Oh, you may have an infection.
How's that?
Just like new, sir.
I guess I'll read for a while.
Good night, Evans.
Good night, sir.
Oh yes, Evans.
Thank you for the dinner.
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid to come home.
You'd kill me.
You'd kill anybody.
Why
Mr. Kessler.
AAH!
Woman screams
Exercise number one.
Arms at the sides.
At the count of one, four times.
Cecile?
One the chest.
At the count of two, move your arms above your head.
At the count of three, lower arms sideways.
If it's exercise you want, there's plenty of it in the kitchen.
At the count of four, lower the arms [knocks on the door]
Cecile!
And straight.
Arms at sides.
Ready, begin.
One, up, up, down, one, up, up, down.
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
Up, up, up.
One, two.
Mr. Kessler.
Yes?
Something terrible has happened.
I tried to wake the new maid.
I think she's dead.
Dead?
How did it happen?
I don't know, sir.
I thought she was taking her exercises.
Call the police.
I'll see what I can do.
Yes, sir.
Well, Mr. Kessler, we're up to our ears in another one.
The girl was killed the same way as the chauffeur six months ago.
Only thing we could find was this note, left by some fellow who wanted to give her the air.
It's terrible, Lieutenant.
She was so young.
If we could find out who killed Cecile, we have the one who committed all the other murders.
That's easier said than done.
There's never been fingerprints, to say nothing of motives.
What gets me, Mr. Kessler, is why you refuse to move out of this place.
Sentimental reasons.
There's nothing very sentimental about a house where anything could happen and usually does.
My mother lived here, Lieutenant.
I see.
You're the gardener?
Yes, but I wasn't here.
I went home early.
See, I live with my wife.
Alright, alright, alright.
And please don't try to see me.
Signed, Ralph.
Ralph?
Do you know him?
Oh, I'm certain I don't.
The name startled me.
I'm practically engaged to a Ralph.
Did you notice anything unusual last night, Evans?
Well, maybe I better not say.
Let's have it, Evans.
When I was putting the roadster in the garage,
I saw Cecile talk to Mr. Dickson.
That's Miss Virginia's Ralph.
Go on.
I didn't mean to listen, but they were talking loud.
Then I heard him say that he never loved her.
She said she wouldn't let him marry anyone else.
That made him real mad, and said nothing was going to stand between him and his happiness.
Not even her.
I knew Cecile a couple of years.
She offered me the companionship I needed.
Then I met you and fell in love for the first time.
I love you too, Ralph.
Surely you can account for your activities from the time you left our house until the next morning.
No, Mr. Kessler.
I had a lot to think about.
I took a long ride into the country, didn't stop anywhere and didn't see a soul I knew.
That's most unfortunate.
All I know is that
I, I didn't kill her.
There isn't any doubt about that in our minds.
Don't worry, son.
We'll do everything we possibly can.
Order.
Order in the courtroom.
You solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Yes, I manage the apartments where Ralph Dickson lived.
Miss Mannix came there often.
As a matter of fact, I thought they were married.
I went home early and helped my wife with the house cleaning.
The coroner's testimony should convince you that the defendant had sufficient reason for wanting to be rid of the victim.
It's the truth.
Said he wouldn't let nothing stand in the way of his happiness, not even her.
We're doing everything we possibly can.
Tomorrow we're going to see the governor.
Oh, and I'm sure something can be done.
But Governor, the man is innocent.
If you would only grant a stay of execution.
If you knew him, you'd realize he couldn't possibly be a murderer.
I'm sorry.
I've gone over the facts in the case, and unless you can present some new evidence, there's nothing I can do.
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness, for his namesake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil.
For thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Thou prepareth a table before me in the presence of mine enemy.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Yes?
I see.
It's all over.
My name is Dickson.
Yes. Of course.
I'd like to see Mr. Kessler.
He's in there.
I hope I'm not intruding.
Oh Ralph!
It can't be.
Apparently my brother never told you about me.
Come in.
I've been in South America.
I flew here at once.
However, I'm afraid it's too late to do any good.
So you're Ralph's brother.
I knew about you, but I never expected such a striking resemblance.
Sorry to have startled you.
This is my daughter, Virginia.
How do you do?
Won't you join us?
I've had my dinner, thanks.
But I would like to talk to you.
Do I look pale?
No.
Huh?
I feel pale.
The buzzer, Evans.
What's the matter, you deaf?
Did he have a good attorney?
Oh, one of the very best.
He's handled all of Dad's legal affairs for years.
Evans, Mr. Dickson will have coffee with us.
Oh, I'm Ralph
Dickson's brother.
Well, you sure had me going for a minute.
But you do look like poor Mr. Ralph.
Coffee.
Yes, sir.
I realize how incriminating circumstantial evidence can be, but it was never brought home to me like this before.
We did everything we possibly could.
You know that Ralph and my daughter were quite serious about each other.
Yes, he told me in his last letter.
Sit down.
How long do you plan to say in this country?
Haven't decided yet, Mr. Kessler.
But I would like to find out who killed that girl.
Mm.
It's something I would like to know, too.
Please consider this your home while you're here.
If there's anything I can do, don't hesitate.
Thank you.
I'll see that your room is put in order.
Are you sure I'm not troubling you?
No, no, not at all.
Entertain Paul until I come back.
Paul, oh Paul?
Yes?
I'll show you to your room.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I must see Evans, oh, about breakfast.
Well, good night Virginia.
Good night, Paul.
Good night, Dad.
Come in.
I hope you'll be comfortable.
I'll send for your luggage in the morning.
It's awfully nice of you, Mr. Kessler.
Really, I hope that it's a pleasure to have you.
Thank you, sir.
Well, I guess I'll turn in.
I haven't had much sleep the last couple of nights.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
Hello, operator?
Give me the police department.
No.
The body has not been touched.
Yes.
Alright.
Good morning, Evans.
Morning, Mr. Kessler.
Now, What's the matter?
The gardener, sir.
What?
He's been murdered.
Murdered?
Strangled.
Well, here we go again.
How long did he work for you?
Oh, about three years, I guess.
Ever say anything to you about having any enemies?
No, sir.
Were you home last night?
Yes, Lieutenant.
To your knowledge, did anybody come in or go out of the house during the course of the evening?
We have a house guest.
Why isn't he here?
I'll get him.
Oh, don't trouble yourself, Mr. Kessler.
Where is he?
He's upstairs in his bedroom.
Let's have a look at him, Ryan.
Good morning.
You're wanted in the kitchen.
In the kitchen?
Yeah.
Am I seeing things?
He's Ralph's brother.
Why, he's the image of him.
How did this happen?
That's what we'd like to find out.
He was strangled, Paul.
Would you mind if we go into the library?
No, that's alright.
Better wait here for the coroner, Ryan.
Not you, Evans.
Hey, where we you on the night of January the 13th?
Have you had your coffee yet?
No.
Well, I guess that's that.
No clues, no fingerprints, no motive, nothing.
But surely if a man was choked to death there would be imprints on his throat.
Hm.
There weren't any on the Mannix girl.
And they were killed the same way, is that right?
That doesn't prove a thing, Dickson.
All the others got it and always the same way.
The coroner's here.
OK.
I'll be right back.
What does he mean by the others?
Just that.
Others have been killed here.
Why in the world do you stay in this place?
We can't leave.
Oh Evans?
Your luggage, sir.
I'll put them in your room.
What about these other murders?
I'll put your luggage in your room, sir.
Oh, Lieutenant?
Yeah?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Well, that'll be a change, anyhow.
What's bothering you?
As a rule, I'm not a very curious person, but er.., house beginning to get you, huh?
In a way, yes.
What about these other murders?
Well, there's been quite a lot of them, Dickson.
Some of the best brains in the department have tried to solve them.
We always run up against a stone wall.
Were the other murders brought out in my brother's trial?
That was different.
That was a cut and dried case.
Why haven't the police closed the house?
Well, we tried to, but Mr.
Kessler took it to court.
Carries a lot of weight around here.
He does a lot of good, too.
You'd think he'd want to leave.
Ah, I guess he's waiting for his wife to come back.
She left him several years ago.
An awful scandal at the time.
Front page stuff and all that.
Poor devil.
He didn't have a chance.
Mm.
Well, I guess I'll be running along.
Glad I met you, Dickson.
Good day, Lieutenant.
Well, this isn't a very pleasant way to entertain a guest.
You know, Mr. Kessler, I have a feeling that somehow or other these mysterious murders are going to be cleared up, and quickly, too.
Nothing will please me more.
Your wife?
Yes.
She's beautiful.
I rarely talk about her, but
I think about her constantly.
She has eyes like Virginia's.
Her hair, her skin.
They were the loveliest
I've ever seen.
I hope you have the pleasure of meeting her.
She'll be back someday.
Hello there.
Paul was admiring your mother's picture.
Father's a sentimentalist.
He has every right to be.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Yes?
Just a moment, please.
It's for you, Dad.
Thank you.
Yes?
Yes, I guess I can.
Yes.
Oh, in about twenty minutes, I'd say.
Surely.
Goodbye.
I'll see you children later.
Business.
Sorry.
That's the only information
I can give you, Mr. Kirby.
Have you notified his wife?
Yes, Mr. Kessler.
Poor thing, she took it quite hard.
It's terrible. Awful
I want to see the coroner.
Yes?
I'm Jules' wife.
Where have they taken him?
In there, Mrs. Mason.
If you please, sir.
May I have one moment alone with him?
I won't ever see him again.
Well yes, I guess so.
Thank you, sir.
AAH!
Mrs. Mason, Mrs. Mason.
You better take her out, Mr. Kirby.
He's alive.
What?
He's alive.
I saw him move.
I'll get the hospital.
You'll be alright, Mrs. Mason.
Steady now.
Get him out of here.
He's not dead.
The doctor will be here any minute.
Jules?
Please, Mrs. Mason.
Jules, listen to me.
Did you recognize the man who tried to kill you?
It was ghastly.
I don't believe I was ever more startled in my life than when Mrs. Mason screamed.
It must have been a terrific shock to see him come back to life.
Yes, it was.
Just a few moments longer and they would have known who the assailant was.
I don't like to bring up the subject, Mr. Kessler, but these murders, did they ever happen in the daytime?
No, I don't believe so.
I see.
You evidently have some reason for asking.
Not particularly.
I was just curious about that one point.
Sorry dinner is late tonight, sir.
But the new cook is having quite a time getting started.
That's alright.
Evans been with you long?
Over some years.
Everything's gone wrong today.
Now I burned the roast.
Oh, don't get so flustered.
You'll be alright.
I was so anxious to make good, I want to stay.
Where is that mixing spoon?
Here it is, right in front of you.
Thanks.
I like it here.
It's nice.
Everything's so quiet and peaceful like.
Ever read the newspapers?
No, they're just full of trash and murders and stuff.
Mm.
What you don't know, well, it's alright.
Here's your pepper salt.
Thanks.
Well, Paul, I'm afraid you have me cornered.
You still have a couple of moves, Mr. Kessler.
You met your equal, Dad.
Oh, your father just got himself into a bad position.
I hear a storm.
It's your game, Paul.
Want to play another?
Oh, thank you, not tonight.
It's getting late.
Pardon me, sir.
Yes?
May I speak to you a moment please?
Well yes, certainly.
The cook wants to leave.
I thought you should know.
Why, she just came.
She feels as if her work is unsatisfactory.
She had so much trouble with dinner tonight.
Why, that's ridiculous.
Oh, I understand, it's her first day.
I'll speak to her.
I'll say good night, Mr. Kessler.
Think I'll turn in.
Thanks for the game.
Good night, Paul.
Good night, Dad.
Good night, child.
I'll walk up with you, Paul.
Oh, glad to have your company.
It's a long, lonesome climb up those stairs all alone.
Where are you going, Marie?
You can't leave us after cooking such an elegant dinner.
Did you really like it, Mr. Kessler?
Why, I never tasted anything to equal that roast beef.
Besides, you can't go now, it's going to rain any minute.
Are you sure you want me to stay?
Oh certainly, Marie.
Well, I like it here, but I thought, then it is settled.
Wait til you taste my apple pie, Mr. Kessler.
Apple pie!
My, that will be a treat.
Let me take this.
You might as well unpack your things, Marie.
Yes, sure.
Thank you, sir.
Not at all, Marie.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Kessler.
Oh, he's a wonderful man.
Now let's see.
What did I do wrong?
Mr. Kessler?
Mr. Kessler?
Are you ill?
What?
Something wrong?
No, Paul.
I must have walked in my sleep.
Well, you did better than I.
I couldn't sleep at all.
It's raining.
Why don't you go to bed, Paul?
I'm alright.
Is there anything I can do?
Nothing, Paul.
Thank you.
I think I'll read for a while.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Kessler.
Well, you look like you had a good night's sleep, Mr. Kessler.
I was so tired when I got to bed,
I don't even remember climbing in.
Dad!
Who would do a thing like that?
I wonder if anyone was hurt.
Nothing could have hurt my father more.
It's unquestionably the work of a madman.
You alright, Evans?
Yes sir, Mr. Kessler.
Good morning, sir.
Where is the new cook?
She said she was going shopping first thing this morning.
Have you looked in her room?
No, sir.
Something wrong, Mr. Kessler?
There's her valise.
She didn't leave.
I'm not worried about that.
When did she tell you she's going to the market?
Last night before she went to bed.
Do you think there's any connection between this and what has happened before?
I don't know.
Have you been through the rest of the house yet?
No, sir.
Good morning,
Mr. Kessler.
Oh, Marie.
You have no idea how happy I am to see you.
Thank you.
I wonder why he was so glad to see me.
Mr. Kessler thought you had been murdered.
Oh, he's so sweet.
I'm going to start to make an apple pie.
Murdered?
I can't imagine who would do a thing like that.
I'll get it.
Good morning, Miss Kessler.
Won't you come in?
Thank you.
That happened last night.
Didn't it fall?
No.
Find me the person who did it and you've got your murderer.
Nobody came into this house last night.
Ryan and his boys were stationed outside.
Lieutenant?
Oh Lieutenant?
Come out!
Come on out, I say!
It's Ryan!
AAH!
Then you didn't hear any noises during the night?
No.
But there's funny things going on around here.
Meaning what?
Well, it's happened three times now.
I put food on the sink, left the room, when I come back it was gone.
No.
You ought to hire a detective to watch it.
That's what you get for being such an excellent cook.
Thank you, sir.
Oh Lieutenant?
Yeah?
Got something?
I don't know.
I, I found this in the picture.
Anybody else know about it?
No, I wanted to speak to you first.
OK.
I'll see if I can match it.
Keep the others downstairs.
Why not?
I agree.
Is, uh, this yours, Mr. Kessler?
Yes.
Why?
I'd thought I'd seen it on you.
Found it in Evans's room.
Well, there's nothing strange about that.
There wouldn't be, Mr. Kessler, but it so happens that a thread from this robe was found embedded in the picture.
Surely you're not trying to accuse Evans?
Oh, it's incredible.
You're just trying to make a case.
Well, somebody's been doing these killings.
Ryan didn't die of heart failure, don't forget that.
When did you give Evans that robe, Mr. Kessler?
I don't remember giving it to him at all.
But naturally, when my things need mending, he just picks them up.
I don't care how he got it.
He had it and he used it on that picture.
I'm going to talk to him.
Now just a minute, Lieutenant.
Yeah?
If Evans is the man we want, it strikes me you've got to have more evidence.
Huh.
Now everybody wants to be a detective.
Now wait a minute.
Perhaps Paul has some suggestion.
Alright, go ahead.
What is it?
Without doubt, the murderer is insane.
The picture tells us that.
I believe we should call in a psychiatrist.
A psychiatrist.
You still got the robe.
But before Evans is accused,
I'm definitely in favor of giving him a sanity test.
What do you say, Lieutenant?
OK.
Maybe I better take one myself.
All we want to know is if the fellow's crazy.
That's very easy to determine.
Shall we make the examination here?
If you don't mind, doctor.
Please tell Evans
I want to see him and then go up to your room.
Go to my room?
Is it possible, doctor, for a man to be normal, say, for two or three months at a time, then go completely insane for an hour or two?
Yes, quite common.
This should be most interesting.
Now what?
A fuse must have blown.
I'll light the candles.
A fuse burned out,
Miss Virginia.
Oh, thank you.
My father wants to see you, Evans.
He's in his room.
Yes, miss.
That will have to do, gentlemen, until the lights are fixed.
I'll be in my room, Evans.
Yes, miss.
I'm sorry, Mr. Kessler, but we ran out of fuses.
I sent Marie over to the store to get some more, sir.
That's alright, Evans.
Sit down.
Oh, pardon me, sir.
Go ahead, Evans.
Sit down.
We want to talk to you.
Alright, sit down.
Do you want to speak to me, sir?
This gentleman would like to ask you a few questions,
Evans.
Yes, sir?
You know these men?
Yes, sir.
What's this gentleman's name?
Mr. Kessler.
Mr. Charles Kessler, sir.
Would you say that Mr.
Kessler is out of his mind?
Uh, I don't understand you.
Would you say that he is insane?
No, sir.
Well, young lady, what are you doing here?
You can't take it.
It's mine, I tell you.
OK, sister, it's yours.
Leave me alone.
I'm going home.
Home to my husband and my daughter.
Of course you are.
And we know where you live, too.
You do?
Sure.
But I'm dead, understand?
I'm dead.
Of course you are.
I'll take you where you want to go.
Now you just come with me, young lady.
Tell me, Evans.
Do you think this man is crazy?
Now don't ask him that, Doc.
I'm beginning to have doubts myself.
Please, Lieutenant.
Oh, alright, alright.
Am I crazy?
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
I know that woman.
She's wicked.
She can't go home.
Yes, yes, I know.
She's bad.
Now you come with me.
There we are.
Ever see this before?
Yes, sir.
What were you doing with it last night?
I don't know what you're talking about, sir.
Look what we found.
Mrs. Kessler!
I'm dead, Charles.
You hear me?
I'm dead.
I'm afraid to come home.
You'd kill me.
You'd kill anybody.
It's Kessler!
Take her out, quickly!
Aah!
Mr. Kessler!
Dad!
Get back in there!
Close that door!
Now you sit right there and we'll see that you get home alright.
Give me a hand, George.
She's dead.
What happened here?
We've got the murderer.
Evans.
No, Mr. Kessler, you.
I knew you'd come back.
Nothing can part us now, my darling.
I can't believe it's going to happen.
Just two more hours, and they're going to kill him.
You know, the way you take on, one would think it was you they're going to hang.
I'd rather, do you hear?
I'd much rather.
He could still get the reprieve, couldn't he, Mr. Cotton?
He will get it.
I'm praying he will.
Oh, he's so young.
They don't ask a murderer his age,
Cookie.
Mr. Geoffrey didn't murder his brother, and you know it as well as I do.
It ain't my business to know.
That's what we've got judges for. They're experts.
What would he do a thing like that for?
Why, he and his brother was pals like you never saw.
The Radcliffes are no murderers.
Blimey, you may be a good butler, but it's a dead cert you ain't no psychologist.
What do you know what goes on inside a man's mind?
Outside he may look like a gentleman, but inside, he may have the hankering for murder.
No. It's no good talking to a man with an apology for a brain.
I wish it was over.
I've been worrying so long whether that reprieve would go through or not, that...
You're all worried out, eh, Cotton?
Oh, shut your lip.
It's hard on all of us, Mr. Cotton, but what about poor Miss Manson?
Instead of him leading her to the altar, they're leading him to the gallows.
And Mr. Cobb, he ain't too happy neither.
Morning tea,
Miss Manson.
Morning? So soon?
Helen, you can't go on like this, you know, without sleep or anything.
You're not being fair to yourself or to Geoffrey.
Now, please have something.
At least a cup of tea.
Oh, Richard, they must have news by now.
Surely the reprieve has come through.
Well, they'd be sure to phone as soon as there's word.
Dr. Griffin is asking for you,
Miss Manson.
- Have you any news?
- None.
Mr. Cobb, isn't there some ray of hope left for him?
There must be hope.
There has to be.
I don't see what more we can do.
I've talked to dozens of influential people in London, old friends of whom I've never asked a favor before.
The Home Secretary, it seems impossible that he shouldn't at least grant a postponement.
Richard, please try.
Helen, if it's "no," be brave.
You know what has to be done.
Yes, very well.
I'll hold on.
You know, Helen,
I'd give my right arm if it would help you.
I feel my position very keenly, not only as Geoffrey's cousin, but as your friend...
Hello? Oh, yes, may I speak to
Philip, please?
Mr. Richard Cobb.
Yes, it's most urgent.
A matter of life and death.
Oh, I see.
Thank you.
It's no use.
He's away in Scotland.
It's impossible to reach him.
Thank you for permitting this last visit, Governor.
I wish I could do more.
It was his last request.
Take Dr. Griffin to the cell.
Sorry, but I can allow you just 10 minutes, Doctor.
Gin.
Governor's permit.
Huh?
Come in, sir.
He's gone!
Who's gone?
What do you mean?
The prisoner!
Radcliffe!
What are you talking about?
I never took me eyes off him, sir, not for half a second.
Then will you kindly explain how he can have gone?
- I wish I knew, sir.
- He just took wing and flew, did he?
You're under arrest, both of you.
Sound the alarm.
Come along.
Sampson speaking.
An escape, eh?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
I see.
Dr. Frank Griffin?
See if we have any file on a Dr. Frank Griffin.
Uh-huh.
All right, I'll be along as soon as possible.
Griffin?
Well, here's how it was, sir.
There wasn't no way he could have gone.
When Griffin was talking to him on the bed here,
I was over here playing cards with Bob.
Wasn't I, Bob?
And when this
Dr. Griffin went, the prisoner started talking to me after a bit about what a rotten day it was.
You know, the way they do to keep their spirits up a bit.
That's right.
And then he went back over here, stepped in here, turned on the water like that.
He washed his hands.
He took a towel like that, and he walked over here, still chatting about the weather, just as offhand as you please.
Then he stopped talking, and after a jiffy we go in.
And here's the water still running.
And there's nothing left but his clothes laying there on the floor, sir.
That's just the way it was.
So help me, Bob.
- Wasn't it, Bob?
- Just as sure as I stand here, sir.
It's witchcraft.
That's what it is, sir.
Don't talk rot, man.
The funny thing is
I believe it, word for word.
But he couldn't have vanished into thin air.
Couldn't he though?
Where have you been?
I've been trying to get you on the phone all morning.
I'm sorry, Mr. Cobb. I gave orders not to be disturbed.
You might have made an exception in my case.
I didn't expect you.
I'm doing some extremely delicate work.
What work can be as important as all that?
Haven't you heard the news?
Geoffrey's escaped, noose practically around his neck.
Yes, it's incredible, isn't it?
Well, that's an extraordinary attitude to take, I must say.
But what can I do?
Do? You must find him and help him.
And Helen.
Helen, with Geoffrey?
Isn't that natural for a fiancee?
She went out this morning and hasn't come back yet.
He's escaped, she's disappeared.
Man alive, doesn't it mean anything to you?
They're in danger.
They're hunting him, and she's with him.
They'll shoot him on sight.
On sight?
Knowing your friendship for Helen and Geoffrey, it's safe to assume that you wouldn't be working here as calmly as you are unless you knew where they were.
I don't think that you have any reason for that assumption.
You're evading my question.
It's obvious you know where they are.
Put that stuff down!
Mr. Cobb, please don't think me rude, but I have an enormous amount of work to do.
Now look here,
Dr. Griffin.
I've supported this laboratory in the tradition of my cousins and their humanitarian ideas.
I must ask you to give me the same consideration as you would give to them.
Gladly.
Very well then.
If they're together, if Helen is with him, they have no money, you must tell me how I can help them.
It's criminal not to.
I'm sorry.
Very well.
Sir Geoffrey's a right smart lad.
He'll get through.
And if he needs any help, he knows where to come for it.
- Aye.
- Come on, you men.
Look alive, dear.
Look alive.
Can't have work interrupted.
Haven't you heard?
Sir Geoffrey has escaped.
They do say it's a mystery.
Seemingly when a chap puts one over on the law, it's always a mystery.
The mystery would be if they catched him.
That's no business of yours!
Perhaps it hasn't occurred to you, the company doesn't pay you to stand here swapping mystery stories.
Keep thee wig on, Willie.
Mr. Spears to you.
I'll thank you to show proper respect.
Go on now. Get down that shaft if you want to keep off the dole.
All right, Mr. Willie Spears.
Get back to work,
I tell thee! Get out of my way!
What can I do for you?
Where can I find Dr. Griffin?
- Who might you be?
- Scotland Yard.
Oh, yes, sir.
I reckon you'll find him in the hospital building, sir, in his laboratory right over there.
Thank you.
A couple of cops.
A lot they'll find out.
Aye, they're up to something.
The gentleman wishes to see you, sir.
- Dr. Griffin?
- Yes.
I'm Sampson, Scotland Yard.
May I come in?
What can I do for you, Inspector?
What can you do for me, Doctor?
Very little,
I'm afraid.
You and Radcliffe were great friends, weren't you, Doctor?
We still are,
I'm happy to say.
Yes, Doctor. Quite so.
The research on which you and he were collaborating was interrupted by the unfortunate accident to Sir Michael, shall we say?
And to carry on such important work, a man like you wouldn't hesitate to break the law, would you?
Suppose you come to the point, Inspector.
I've been looking up the file on your late brother.
That was nine years ago, wasn't it?
Charming fellow and very ingenious.
He concocted a formula which included a poisonous drug called duocaine, an extraction of an East Indian herb that took the color out of things.
Combined with other ingredients known only to himself, it made the body transparent when injected into the bloodstream.
Very ingenious.
He succeeded, didn't he, in making himself invisible?
Really, Inspector, you don't have to go through all that.
I can remember it very well.
Yes, it isn't a thing a mere nine years can make you forget, is it?
You recall, of course, how he went insane and never regained visibility till after he was dead, and how he was finally killed by the police.
Shot down like a mad dog after hundreds had lost their lives.
A most hideous crime.
But, of course, Doctor, you would never make a man invisible with the danger of him going mad, unless you had a means of bringing him back in time.
Surely, in all those nine years, you've found a method of avoiding insanity, or perhaps even restoring visibility.
I was never interested in my brother's activities.
Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor.
I had hoped that you might cooperate.
You must realize that if the monster murders, the scientist hangs.
Have a cigar?
No, thanks.
I don't smoke.
Try it.
In smoke or rain, he becomes visible.
Cover this place.
I'll send some men out.
I tell you, miss, you're the first visitor to this cottage in nigh on a year.
Excepting Dr. Griffin, coming to look at my gouty old foot.
When do you expect the patient?
He'll be here very soon, Ben.
There's naught I won't be glad to do for a patient of Dr. Griffin.
Aye, and I'll be glad to have a body to talk to.
He's had a very serious accident,
Ben.
He needs rest and no unnecessary conversation.
Depend on me, miss.
Old Ben never talks except when it's wanted.
And I think he'd rather that no one knew he was here.
That's old Towser.
I wonder what's come over him.
Getting old and talkative, seems like.
What's the matter, you old fool?
Be quiet now.
Helen. Darling.
Come inside quickly, darling.
Will you stop?
It's not Buckingham
Palace, darling.
You're wrong. It is.
But at least it's comfortable and safe.
How does it feel to have a phantom fiance?
You're the best phantom I happen to know.
I can touch you.
Oh, you poor boy.
I don't know what to say.
I'm lucky.
I can see you.
After all, I'm not much to look at anyway.
Even when I...
Even when this...
It doesn't make any difference, dear.
We're together.
Soon it'll be as it always was.
All this is just a dream.
Now come.
Sit down and rest.
I'll get some tea.
You must be famished.
Oh, no. Thanks just the same, darling, but I don't want anything to eat.
Just sit down and talk to me.
It's all right.
You must have thought
I'd never get here.
It was kind of awful waiting, wondering if something had happened to you.
I couldn't find the spot where Frank had hidden the bag with the clothes.
You can't imagine how cold
I was until I found them.
You know, I'm beginning to understand why ghosts moan so in this sort of weather.
You haven't changed a bit.
That's a slight exaggeration.
But if the worst comes to the worst,
I can always get a job haunting a house.
There's not going to be any "worst."
Frank won't let us down.
He's working day and night on the antidote.
Stop that infernal row!
No, no.
I'm sorry, darling.
It's just that...
All these months,
I've thought about this day, mentally adjusting myself, certain that I'd be able to accept the change quite casually.
Now that it's happened, now that it's become a reality,
I don't know.
I can't stand it any longer, Helen!
He'll rouse the whole neighborhood. Stop him!
Darling, you know there's no one around here for miles.
Ben. I say, Ben, can't you take that dog away?
Tie him somewhere where we can't hear him.
Oh, don't pay no heed on him, miss.
Hey, you gert blunderhead.
I can't say
I blame you.
- I'd better be on my way again.
- Where?
Darling, I can't just sit around here with Michael's murderer at large.
Geoff, I understand, but you've got to take it easy for a few days.
You've been under such an awful strain.
I've almost forgotten how to relax.
I suppose I'll get used to this.
You won't have to, Geoff.
Frank's sure he'll have the antidote within a few days.
Yes. Yes, of course.
Helen...
- Promise me something.
- Yes?
Frank gave me his word that if my mind should begin to go before he found a way back for me, he'd prevent me doing any harm.
Chain me if necessary.
Help him keep his promise.
I don't know, darling. I feel...
You know, I feel...
I feel...
Hello there!
Jumpin' Jehoshaphat!
What do you want?
I was wondering whether a bite to eat wouldn't be welcome, sir?
Thank you.
Helen, don't look at me like that!
It was just waking up...
- And hearing Ben's voice.
- And then seeing me.
- Oh, Geoff, nothing's changed.
- Oh, I should have let them hang me!
Darling, darling, you mustn't say that!
Who was ever faced with a choice like that?
To be hanged by the neck until I was dead, or to take life on the terms of this fantastic drug.
Invisibility at the price of almost certain madness!
- Today, tomorrow...
- Darling, you must be patient.
It was fear!
Nothing but fear that decided me.
Oh, Helen, my life isn't so valuable that I should endanger yours and Frank's.
Oh, I am sorry, darling.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm a worm to treat you like this after all you've been through.
Here.
Now, we'll...
We'll wipe away those tears.
I'll try and act like a normal person.
Ben?
Hello there!
Ben!
Hey, Ben, isn't this your dog?
Aye! Daft old fool,
I had to put him out!
Put him out?
What for?
Listen. Shut up!
Keeping the whole place awake.
You have visitors, eh?
Visitors?
What would I be doing with visitors?
Nobody visits poor old Ben.
Then who were the dog keeping awake?
The neighbors.
Are you soft, man?
Why, there isn't a neighbor closer than Higginbottoms.
More than a couple of miles from here.
Look at him barking and barking like a mucky old fool!
Who's inside?
Isn't nobody here and nobody hasn't been here.
Who's in the upstairs room then?
Neither nobody nor nothing!
Here, be off, you.
I don't want any nosy coppers around my house.
All right, Ben.
Hey, I pay my rates regular.
Here, here, you can't go in there!
- What are we gonna do?
- Don't be afraid, darling.
I can leave any moment I like.
- It's my house!
- What's the matter with you?
Come along now.
I doesn't need you to search the whole house.
I wants to search that room upstairs.
I want a warrant before you can search my house.
And I don't need no warrant for that.
Get out of my way!
I want a warrant from you!
I couldn't stop him.
It isn't my fault.
"Neither nothing nor nobody," eh?
What's going on in here?
You know that you're intruding in a private house?
- Yes, sir, but...
- Then leave quickly, or you'll find yourself in trouble!
Come on, you silly old fool!
I'd better go now, darling.
You'll have to be brave.
- I'm trying to.
- Better turn around.
This may not be very pleasant.
Sorry.
You mucky old fool!
You doesn't know what you're doing!
Oh, I doesn't, eh?
Geoff, where shall I see you?
Where will you go?
I'll meet you at the manor after I've seen Frank.
- Take care of yourself, darling.
- I will.
It's bright and warm outside, thank goodness.
I'll be all right.
Helen!
Helen, darling!
His face is all wrapped up like, and he won't give me his name.
Will I arrest him?
We found him. He's at the gamekeeper's house.
A chap named Jenkins.
Don't do anything foolish.
And understand he must not get away.
And listen carefully now, under no circumstances allow him to take off his clothes.
Take off his clothes?
He won't do that, sir.
There's a lady with him.
Do as I tell you!
I'll be over right away.
"Don't let him take off his clothes." Is he daft?
- Take off his clothes.
- Hey, you can't go upstairs!
- It's no good, Ben. I have me duty to do.
- Get out of my house!
- Assaulting the law, are you?
- What do you know about assaulting...
- You have no business...
- Here, come here.
What are you doing?
- It's none of your problems. Come here.
- You have no business...
Let me alone!
It's the law!
And I have to uphold it!
That's what
I call bodily assault!
He took off his clothes!
No wonder she fainted.
So you just let the lady walk out and ride away, eh?
I had nothing to hold
Miss Manson on, sir.
I had no instructions about her.
And her looking so ill, sir.
Tewksbury, you're a credit to the force.
You used brains.
Watch her, but don't scare her too much.
That's our game.
We can't expect to catch the quarry if we shut up the bait.
Aye, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Here we are, sir.
Here. You can check with the prison records.
- They match.
- Yes?
Well, that clears up any doubt as to his identity, anyway.
Helen.
Helen!
Thank goodness that you're safe and sound.
I've lain awake all night worrying about you.
I'm sorry, Richard.
I should have thought.
You're so pale and exhausted.
You must consider yourself, Helen.
Where have you been?
- I'm quite all right.
- Helen...
You don't know what it means to me just to see you.
When you're away, I...
You look tired.
Go upstairs and rest.
I'll see you later in the study.
Who is it?
Who is it?
- Well?
- I don't know.
I was sure
I heard a knock too.
Hello, Radcliffe
Accident Home.
No, I'm sorry.
Mr. Champion was removed to the county hospital this morning.
I must have been mistaken.
Geoff.
- Headline news, eh?
- Of course.
- They don't know that I...
- Ah, but they do.
The police got out the file on my brother and twigged the whole thing in two minutes.
An inspector was here to tell me all about it.
Charming fellow.
- Why didn't they arrest you?
- How could they?
First they have to prove there is an invisible man, then that you're it, and finally, that
I'm one of the, uh, gang.
Well, that sounds enough to keep them busy for a while.
- How are you getting on?
- Splendidly.
But I need a little bit of your blood, old boy.
Gladly, if you can find it.
- Here, sit down here.
- Thanks.
Now, we get some alcohol.
See if we can find your vein without putting a tourniquet on your arm.
This feels like it.
It's gonna hurt.
- Frank.
- What is it?
How long do you think I have before I go mad?
Mmm.
Two days, two weeks...
Who knows?
Do you think you'll find the antidote before I...
Oh, I'll find it, all right. Don't you worry.
Good.
Here it is, I hope.
Now we'll put some color in this.
By Jove! That's what I call neat.
Comes of practicing on guinea pigs.
- Dr. Griffin!
- Come back later.
But it's important.
About the men working where Champion was injured.
Let him in.
One moment.
Oh, so he wouldn't see me.
I was thinking it would be nice if we could have a little talk.
That's a matter of opinion.
You've been interfering again in the pit, I hears, telling the men not to work in Number Three tunnel.
Glorified as usual, eh?
I'm doing my duty,
Dr. Griffin.
And if you'd do yours and not meddle where you're not wanted, happen Radcliffe pit would get along better.
Listen, Mr. Spears.
My duty is the men's health.
Any child would know that tunnel was unsafe.
Why, it's a sheer miracle that Champion got off with a pair of crushed legs in the fall yesterday.
Happen so, Dr. Griffin.
But Mr. Cobb gives the orders in Radcliffe pit and I get them carried out.
Happen also, Mr. Cobb says we don't need no laboratory.
Nor no doctor neither.
We're going to give you a nice little holiday.
"We"? You can tell
Mr. Cobb I'm not leaving.
I take orders from Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe.
"Sir Geoffrey."
Eh!
They'll shoot him down like a mad tyke.
I'll thank you to get out.
Mr. Cobb's the heir and the owner.
He'll have you out of here pretty quick.
As long as
Sir Geoffrey's alive,
Mr. Cobb knows he has nothing whatever to say.
Now get out of here before I bash your ugly head in!
You'll pay for this,
Dr. High-and-mighty.
Mr. Cobb will chuck you out.
See if he don't.
What's come over this place?
An imbecile like Spears talking to you in that manner.
A night watchman.
He never even did that job well.
Cobb made him superintendent.
His idea of superintending is to ignore every one of the safety rules that you laid down.
I don't understand it.
A man of that type.
Why on earth should Cobb...
You know, Frank, it's surprising how invisibility heightens one's sense of smell.
Goodbye.
Where are you going?
I think I smell something dead up a creek.
Whole place going to the dogs, that's what.
Hey!
Old crock. Eh.
You can't repair it,
Mr. Spears.
I had but one glass of whiskey.
Only one?
Well, two.
Satan!
You can't escape either, Mr. Spears.
- Where are you?
- Here I am, Mr. Spears.
Not over there. Here.
Show yourself, you coward, and I'll fight you!
Help! Help!
Faster,
Mr. Spears, faster!
Help!
Why don't you fly, Mr. Spears?
I told you there was no escape, didn't I, Mr. Spears?
Where are you?
- Where are you?
- Here beside you.
- But... But I can't see you!
- Of course you can't.
I'm a ghost.
Ghost!
Can a ghost sneeze?
It's cold in the other world, so cold!
Lend me that handkerchief of yours, Mr. Spears.
Who are you, ghost?
What do you want of me?
They were going to hang me, Mr. Spears.
Remember me? Geoffrey Radcliffe.
But I escaped the noose.
I ran blindly out into the mist.
I didn't know the marshes were there.
I stumbled and fell.
It pulled me down.
Inch by inch, down.
It was a horrible death, Mr. Spears.
I can't find peace in the other world.
No!
Here, I must have had a nightmare.
I've been imagining things.
It isn't a very comfortable feeling, is it, Mr. Spears?
Have pity,
Sir Geoffrey! Have pity!
Did you have any pity on me?
Had you one thought for me, lying day after day in that prison of despair?
- No...
- Feeling the rope around my throat, choking the very breath of life out of me?
What was it to you? Nothing!
You were promoted.
You were made superintendent.
There's an account to be settled, Mr. Spears.
I'll tell everything!
I'll tell everything!
Mr. Cobb made me lie!
He were in the shaft when Sir Michael were killed.
I saw you come out, sir, and I heard
Sir Michael call after you.
Then, after you'd come out,
Mr. Cobb come out.
I couldn't help meself, sir.
Mr. Cobb told me he'd kill me if I told on him.
Sir Geoffrey, you've always been such a kind man and all.
Have mercy on a poor, ignorant man.
Sir Geoffrey!
Sir Geoffrey!
Where are you?
Where are you?
There!
That's exactly what I've been looking for.
No, no, no, no!
Sorry your little trip will have to be postponed, Mr. Spears.
But don't worry,
I'm going to make you quite comfortable.
And after I've got you all tucked up for the night,
I've got an appointment to keep with a certain gentleman named Richard Cobb.
I must say, I wouldn't have given
Richard credit for so much ingenuity.
Helen.
I'm so glad you've come.
You know, you really are amazing.
It's hard to believe you've had so little rest.
Thank you, Richard.
Now come and sit down and tell me all about it.
- How's Geoffrey?
- Geoffrey?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, I...
I assumed you'd be with him.
Lucky I got back before the rain started.
Helen, I want you to trust me.
Without our help, he hasn't the chance.
The police are sure to find him.
We'll get him to the continent or to America.
You must tell me where he is for his sake.
All right, Richard.
I'll start from the beginning.
I'll start from the beginning if you don't mind, Helen.
- Geoffrey!
- Yes, Richard,
I've come for a little chat.
Geoffrey, where are you?
You're amongst friends, there's no danger.
Friends like you are a great comfort.
Where are you,
Geoffrey? Show yourself.
I'd have a little difficulty doing that just now.
Where are you hiding?
Perhaps that will show you where your friend is hiding.
Sit down.
Now, Richard, start to write.
- Write what?
- A confession, of course.
I... I don't know what you're talking about.
No? Well, then,
I'll help revive your memory.
You recall my brother,
Michael, no doubt?
Yes.
And surely you remember killing him?
- It isn't true!
- Geoffrey, he didn't kill Michael.
Didn't he?
That shows how little you know dear old Richard.
It was his charming way of getting rid of both of us.
Killing Michael, implicating me.
No, don't shoot! No!
No! Don't!
No, don't!
Oh, Mr. Cobb!
I'm Inspector Sampson.
Can I be of any help?
- I don't understand.
- Well, he's here, is he?
Geoffrey, he's invisible.
Why can't I see him?
Smoke a cigar, Mr. Cobb, and perhaps you will.
Is everyone mad?
You must catch him, Inspector.
He wants to kill me.
Mmm? What makes you think he'd want to do that,
Mr. Cobb?
Because he's mad, completely out of his mind!
I must get away.
Your safety means as much to us as it does to you, Mr. Cobb.
I think you'd be wise to stay.
In fact, I'm sure you'd better stay!
Out! Out!
You take five men with nets and smoke cylinders to the upper floor.
You take five men to the servants' quarters.
Very good, sir.
You watch the front door.
You see that all doors and windows are covered from the outside.
The rest, follow me.
Now, Mr. Cobb,
I'd be very happy to provide you with a cordon of police to ensure your safety.
Just a moment.
Now, Mr. Cobb, if you'll just sit down.
Thank you.
You, the door.
Close it, stay there.
You, the window.
You, the back door.
The rest of you, around him, close.
Guard this man carefully.
He's extremely valuable.
I appreciate your good intentions,
Inspector.
But I'd rather have an escort to take me to London.
You're perfectly safe here, Mr. Cobb,
I can assure you.
What assurance can you give me while
I'm in the same house with him?
Mr. Cobb, please.
Calm down, calm down.
Inspector, you must help me.
I can't stay here.
Take me into protective custody.
- Take me to prison.
- Plenty of time, Mr. Cobb.
Plenty of time.
Orders to shoot on sight.
I thought he said the bloke was invisible.
You missed him!
How did you know I did?
You watch the door.
I know.
We nearly got him, sir.
As soon as he steps out in the rain, you can spot him.
- Where is he now?
- We've chased him back in the house, sir.
Good, keep at it.
We've got him bottled up now.
Beg your pardon, miss.
Get to work, men.
You have no right here.
Sorry, we have our orders.
You've got to get out of here, miss.
Will you please leave me alone?
- I'll never leave you alone, darling.
- Geoffrey.
I can get out of here, if you'll lend me a hand.
Just faint, will you please, darling?
Faint?
Nothing in the servants' rooms, sir.
You fellows stay here till they finish upstairs.
When they come down, we'll do the ground floor and the cellar.
I know he's down here somewhere.
- What's the matter with the blasted thing?
- It's the safety valve!
The safety valve!
Make way, you men, we need air.
Come! Get her out. Quick!
She needs air.
Stop that!
Get out of the way.
Bill! Harry!
Come quick!
We've got him.
Upstairs, quick!
That's it.
Stay on. Come on, put your shoulders in it.
It isn't him, sir.
A profound observation.
- Evening, Briggs.
- Evening, sir.
- Everything quiet?
- Quiet as the grave.
- Rain stopped.
- About time, too.
Not so lovely for you if our friend drops in.
I'm ready for him.
Fat lot of good that'll be against something that isn't there.
I don't hold with no spiritualism.
This isn't spiritualism.
This spook's alive.
How can he be alive if he isn't there?
You'll know soon enough when he suddenly leaps on your back and starts sucking your blood.
Get off.
See you later, I hope.
Briggs! Briggs!
- What's the matter?
- Something moved!
Did it?
Who's up there?
Come down now or you'll cop it.
See you later, I hope.
Answer it, Helen.
Hello? Geoff.
Sorry, Helen, I couldn't come to the lab.
I'm at Frank's house.
Of course the place is guarded, but little things like that don't stop me any longer.
Tell Frank this house of his is chilly.
I'm going to get into his best suit of clothes.
Just a minute.
He's at your house.
He wants some of your clothes.
- Tell him to go ahead.
- Help yourself, dear.
I will.
You and Frank come over here.
We're going to celebrate!
Celebrate? Well, yes, we'll be over soon.
"Celebrate"!
What on earth does he want to celebrate?
That he must go mad?
That his friend, the great scientist
Frank Griffin, has utterly failed him?
- Frank!
- Oh, Helen, I never should have done it.
Imagine me thinking
I could solve this riddle in a few days.
- I'd need a lifetime.
- Frank...
What an utter fool I've been!
Frank, you're exhausted.
You mustn't lose hope.
The harder I work, the more endless the job looks.
How can I possibly succeed?
My brother was the foremost chemical engineer in the country, and all he ever succeeded in finding was madness.
- But, Frank...
- How can I face Geoff with nothing?
Whatever happens, you mustn't let him know that.
I've let you both down.
You should have seen them searching for me, Frank.
Smoke bombs and gas masks and the fishnets.
They must have thought
I was a herring.
And I marched straight through them with Helen, took her politely out to the car.
Softly, old boy.
Don't forget the wolves are prowling outside.
Yes. You know, Frank, I'm beginning to get a new perspective on this crawling little animal known as man.
Why, a dog or a cat or a bird is cleverer than any human.
They sense me immediately.
But these shrewd detectives of yours...
Take away one of man's senses and you render him helpless.
Geoff, you don't really think Richard could have killed...
"Could have"?
He did.
I have proof of it.
Dear old
Inspector Sampson.
He's turned out to be my best assistant.
He's keeping Richard prisoner for me...
Until I'm ready for him.
And Richard's boyfriend, Spears, is anxiously awaiting me at his home.
Does Sampson know that Cobb and Spears are mixed up together in this?
- No, not yet.
- Then why not produce the evidence?
Give Sampson the information, and you'll be free.
Free?
I am free!
I've never been more free in my life.
You know, being invisible has distinct advantages.
It gives one a sense of power that's exciting.
Power for good, if you are so inclined.
Or, should you feel perverse, for evil.
You hold the balance and decide which way life shall go.
No one can stop you.
No one can touch you.
You don't need any infantile little
Sampsons to carry out your will.
You're much greater than any of them.
Rather a magnificent idea to play with, isn't it?
More wine, Frank.
I'll get it.
- Sorry.
- Just what we needed.
Seven days' good luck.
Geoff, you can't mean that about having power for good or evil.
Of course I can.
Just think what I could do for my country.
Or, let's say, with my country.
Control it!
Other nations would tremble before us as this nation will tremble before me.
Don't you see what my power does for me?
I could sit in on the councils of kings and dictators.
It makes me king!
It makes me nemesis.
Geoffrey, do you remember a promise I made you?
What promise?
To restrain you if the effects of the duocaine disturbed your mind?
Are you, by any chance, trying to be amusing?
No.
It just occurred to me that...
You're not mistaking my good spirits for madness, I hope.
I just wondered if you remembered.
You needn't worry about my memory.
Geoff's right.
No worrying this evening.
A toast! To the quick conviction of the ambitious Mr. Cobb.
What's the matter with you?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Please,
Geoff, take it easy.
You know they're watching the house.
If they hear you, they'll break up our little party.
You aren't afraid for me, are you?
Well, I...
No, you aren't.
You know they can't get me.
You're afraid for yourself.
Afraid of what they might do to you!
Geoff, don't talk like that.
Oh, my dear friend, Dr. Griffin.
Has it ever occurred to you that friendship, at best, is a rather doubtful asset?
I don't want friends.
I shall have worshippers and followers, people who will obey me because they recognize my greatness.
Those who are loyal will be rewarded, and the others destroyed.
Hail, invincible leader.
We follow you.
Let's drink to the coming golden age which you will provide.
I don't think I care to drink with you.
Somehow I don't feel very comfortable with you any longer.
Geoffrey.
Don't worry.
I'll be back.
Frank, is...
Helen, you mustn't lose your head now.
You mean he...
I never thought the duocaine would work so fast.
- He's mad.
- No, Frank, no!
I was hoping he'd take that drink.
It's drugged.
- Why?
- I can't control him by force.
What are we going to do?
When he comes back, we'll have to play up to him.
Get him to take the drink.
Don't stand there cowering.
Sit down and finish your supper.
I feel better this way.
In a second,
I'm safe.
And not only from the police.
I can roar my head off if I want to!
Let's drink to the golden age.
Well, drink.
Drink to me!
Drink to my invincible power, to a new era, to a changed world with me as its guiding genius.
Well, why don't you smile?
That's better.
Now, I'm sorry to leave your two smiling, happy faces, but I have business to attend to.
Richard expects me.
I hate disappointing friends.
Oh, Frank!
Don't worry. The effect of the drink won't take long to wear off.
No, he'll be violent when he comes to.
I was prepared for it.
I'll take him into the study.
Open the door.
Please don't come in, Helen.
Stay where you are.
Four cylinders, and only missing on three, eh, Inspector?
Is he all right, Frank?
There's only one thing to do, Helen.
Get Sampson.
Give him up?
We can't.
But if Geoff has proof that Cobb is the murderer,
- and he has Spears as a witness...
- But how do we know he has?
It may just be his imagination.
Oh, I don't know.
- Frank?
- Better let me.
I'm sorry, Geoff, but it was necessary.
I was just keeping my promise.
That's all right.
I suppose
I drank too much.
With all the excitement, well, I passed out, didn't I?
Yes.
Sorry I can't remove those.
I feel much better with them on.
Safer.
- I'm glad you did it.
- Listen to me, Geoff.
You've got to tell me what proof you have against Cobb.
Then we can put
Sampson to work on it, and that'll leave us free to give all our time to the antidote.
Yes, of course.
That's the right idea.
I say, Frank, the wine left me awfully dry.
Do you suppose I could have some water?
Of course.
I'll get it.
Is he better, Frank?
Much. It was only a temporary attack.
He's quite normal again now.
Here you are.
Geoff! Don't!
Geoff! Geoff!
Don't!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Hello?
Open up!
Open this door!
We're police officers!
Get in that window!
What happened?
In there.
Dr. Griffin!
Good morning, Richard.
- Geoffrey!
- Don't raise your voice, Richard.
And don't touch that bell rope, or I might have to wind it around your neck.
No one can help you now except yourself.
I'm not afraid of you, Geoffrey.
Aren't you?
It's only that
I can't see you.
I'm not a coward.
You would be afraid of me if you couldn't see me.
On the contrary, it would be a pleasure, and one that I hope soon to enjoy.
Get up.
Get up!
We're going out, you and I, for a breath of fresh air.
Turn around.
Put up your arms.
Now, put them down.
So. Now walk quite naturally as if no one was with you.
Be charming and clever when you speak to the guards, and be careful, Richard.
I may press the trigger in my excitement.
Open the door.
I'm sorry, sir, but you can't leave.
But please, I... I...
I told you to act cleverly.
Surely, you can still lie.
I recall your being an expert.
Good morning, Mr. Cobb.
Good morning.
Have you been took ill?
I'm not feeling very well.
I'm just going out for some fresh air.
I'm sorry, sir.
Bill up there had no right letting you through.
Inspector's orders.
I'm not a prisoner.
I'm under protective custody.
Suppose this invisible chap is hiding about.
Aren't you afraid of that?
Why, of course not.
No more am I, sir.
Between you and me, sir,
I'll have to see him before I'll believe he's invisible.
Just to keep the record straight, sir,
I'll have Bill phone the inspector.
Bill!
Bill!
He's in the kitchen again with his head in the icebox.
You wait here a minute, sir.
I'll phone the inspector myself.
Here we are.
Recognize the place?
- Geoffrey...
- Quiet!
Good morning,
Mr. Cobb.
Good morning.
Good morning to you.
Get out.
- Geoffrey, give me a chance to explain...
- I intend to immediately. Out!
Move along now.
You'll find the key under the mat.
Unlock the door.
Light that candle.
Yes, Richard, it's your friend, Spears.
Move over to him.
I want you to take a good look at him.
Go on! Move!
Now, take the gag out of your friend's mouth.
I'm sure he wants to talk to you.
Do as I tell you!
Go on! Go on!
Please, Sir Geoffrey, let me down.
My dear, Mr. Spears, surely you can't be so exhausted already, with the rope around your neck only a few hours.
The pair of you had it around mine for months!
All right, Spears, out with it!
I said it once, and I'll say it again.
I saw Cobb do it.
Hit Sir Michael over the head with a wrench and shove him down the shaft.
He promised me money and a good position if I kept my mouth shut.
- Don't kid!
- I'm innocent!
Where is your power now?
Now I'm as invisible as you are!
I'll show you where my power is!
Take that!
I'll get you!
- What's happening?
- He's breaking the place up again.
- Who's he fighting?
- Pink elephants, as usual.
He's a proper menace, that Willie is!
May the best elephant win, eh?
Come on, Tommy, let's see what's up.
Now
I've got you, you swine!
I'll choke the life out of you!
There!
Mr. Cobb! Mr. Cobb!
Mr. Cobb!
What's he running from?
What's he running for?
Stop him!
Now I've got you!
There he is!
There he is!
Now I have you, Richard!
I'm going to force the truth out of you, too!
No one can help you now.
Halt that escalator!
- Stop it!
- Tell them you killed my brother.
Tell them you murdered Michael.
Tell them or I'll...
Don't shoot!
Michael.
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff, where are you?
Look lower in the pile.
Search with your hands, not your eyes!
- Mr. Sampson!
- What is it?
We can't find him up here, sir!
Keep on searching!
He must be about here somewhere.
Miss Manson.
Mr. Cobb is asking to see you.
I don't want to see him.
Geoffrey!
But Dr. Griffin says he's hurt very bad, miss.
Helen...
I killed...
Michael.
Do you mind if I borrow your clothes, old man?
It's cold.
I'm a bit shaky.
You don't mind, do you?
Thanks.
Nice suit of clothes you've got there.
You know, I really shouldn't do this.
I really shouldn't.
They'll be able to catch me now.
Slender waist you've got.
Not a bad fit, my friend.
You wouldn't refuse me now, old man?
Thanks.
You know, they've hunted me all over the country.
They shot me, too.
I'm a murderer.
Don't be scared, old crow, I...
I only want your clothes.
Yes, that's right.
I'll have to have your hat, too.
I'm really freezing.
Thanks for your help.
Why don't you find him?
When you thought he was a murderer, you tried every way you knew to trap him and to kill him.
But now that you know he's innocent, probably dying somewhere, alone and deserted, you've lost all interest, haven't you?
Why don't you use your cleverness now to save him?
I've got all my men out, Miss Manson.
You know what we're up against.
What is that?
What is that?
You can't see his head!
It's Geoffrey.
His pulse is almost gone.
There must have been a tremendous loss of blood.
I believe he'd stand a chance if he could have an immediate transfusion.
I'm ready.
Shall I prepare
Miss Manson for a test?
Yes, but we need more than she can supply.
- How is he? How is he?
- How is he, Doctor?
Please, please!
Sir Geoffrey has to have a blood transfusion to save his life.
- Who'll volunteer?
- I will!
Just come in quietly.
I'll have to make some tests.
Transfusion successful, Doctor?
Well, complicated.
How is he?
He'll die.
No.
Internal bleeding.
If only I could operate!
But how can I when I can't see him?
Sampson,
I'd like to try this antidote.
There's a very small chance that it'll work and a far greater one that it'll kill him.
But if I don't try it, he has no chance whatever.
Prepare a hypodermic please, nurse.
Frank! Frank!
The new blood itself was the antidote.
Helen.
Geoffrey.
Helen, darling.
- This is the case of Armand Tesla, vampire, as compiled from the personal notes of Professor Walter Saunders,
Kings College, Oxford.
The following events took place in the outskirts of London towards the close of the year, 1918.
They began on the night of October the 15th.
A particularly gloomy, foggy night, that was well suited for a visitation by the supernatural.
Master.
It's night again.
Beautiful, dark, silent night with the fog creeping in.
Time for you to awaken, Master.
Time for you to go out.
Andreas, you will tell me what has transpired during the hours of light.
She is still alive, Master.
I watched her through the window at Dr. Ainsley's sanatorium.
She just lies there on a cot stares upward at nothing at all.
And a great professor, an old teacher of Dr. Ainsley. has come from Oxford to find out what is wrong with her.
Just as if any of them could tell what happened.
Prowlers?
Possibly, we have them sometimes.
Oh.
Look at this, Professor Saunders.
Well?
There's nothing wrong with this blood condition.
Certainly no indication of anemia.
Yet, the woman was practically bloodless when she was found.
Nothing to indicate hemorrhage, wounds?
Not a sign of a thing.
She was evidently suffering from shock.
We haven't been able to get a thing out of her.
Hm.
Baffling, very.
That's why I sent for you, Professor.
- Master John, you simply must not jump about like this.
Oh, Lady Ainsley, I'm so glad
Grandpapa brought me with him.
We've been playing war, sir.
Nicki was a German, and I killed her.
- I hope he didn't kill you very much, darling.
- Don't you think it's time you were in bed, young man, or don't soldiers sleep?
Of course they do.
- May I play one piece on the piano before we go to bed?
- Please?
- Very well, then, just one.
Oh, hooray, come, Nicki.
We can be riding in a tank until we get there.
- I'm sorry to have interrupted you, milady.
That's quite all right.
We'll be up later to tuck them in.
Shall we see the patient now?
- Yes.
Put the light on the patient's face, please.
Miss Norcutt, can you hear me?
Miss Norcutt?
That light, my eyes.
No, don't close your eyes.
Just keep looking at me as long as you can.
Yes, like that.
Observe the eyes.
The dilation, almost hypnosis.
You're hurting me.
Who's hurting you?
Answer, am I hurting you?
Miss Norcutt, answer.
My dream.
What dream?
Your eyes looked like burning coals.
Don't come any nearer.
Don't touch me.
No, no, I didn't tell them.
No.
No, I didn't tell them.
I didn't tell them.
Dr. Ainsley!
What did she mean about the dream?
I don't know yet.
I'm afraid it goes deeper than medicine.
Deeper even than science.
From the beginning of time man has been troubled. by the uncertainty of death and by the rare and horrible manifestations which occur at intervals in which the dead are known to return from their graves.
- Professor, you haven't been to bed.
No.
You've discovered something.
I want you to come with me.
Lacerations about the size of pinpricks on the throat.
What?
Look.
Needle pricks, surely.
No, I paid no attention to those marks on her throat last night because they seemed unimportant.
This morning I know better.
What then do they indicate?
- Incisions made by the teeth of a vampire.
A vampire, a bat, an animal?
- No, Jane, not a bat, a vampire, a monster.
A fantastic something that draws blood from the human body through the jugular veins of its victim.
This thirst for blood is akin to our craving for food.
Without human blood, they perish.
Listen to these notes that I have made from the writings of a Romanian scientist, an authority on vampirism.
Armand Tesla, who lived 200 years ago.
This, for instance.
Once attacked, the victim of a vampire is completely dominated by this creature.
- But surely vampires exist only in the imagination.
- Did imagination make those marks on her throat?
But-
- Was it reality or fantasy that caused the dogs to bark last night as though wolves were about?
But this is ridiculous.
I can't believe-
- Milady.
- What is it, Elsa?
- It's Nicki.
I can't wake her.
- Nicki.
Transfusion, our only chance.
Then, you're really convinced that Nicki was attacked by a vampire.
- There's not the slightest room for doubt.
If we allow another night to pass, it will try to reach her again.
And the next time may prove fatal.
How ghastly.
- I tell you, not a soul will ever believe us, but we know this monster exists.
A menace, deadly, horrible.
We must destroy it.
- But how?
- According to this Dr.
Armand Tesla a vampire can only be destroyed by driving a spike through its heart while it sleeps in its coffin.
Or by forcing it out into the bright sunlight which will cause it to shrivel and perish.
- We can't see this thing through by ourselves.
Yes, we can.
A vampire must rest during the day in the soil in which it was buried.
But the coffin might be hidden anywhere.
Could it?
How many graveyards are there in this vicinity?
Well, there's the church fields and the burial ground at Old Priory, but that's been abandoned for years.
- Then, we must try them both and pray for guidance.
Are you coming with me?
Yes.
Look here.
Professor.
- There's nothing to fear as long as we have the sunlight.
We haven't much time.
Look, Jane.
If this is it, it's likely to be here.
Yes.
Why, it's a man and he's alive.
- Yes, alive, with the blood of his victim.
Now are you convinced, Jane?
But how can we be certain?
According to Dr. Tesla, a vampire's face casts no reflection in a mirror.
Shall we try?
Oh, Professor.
You killed him.
Killed the master.
Why, what is it?
Some loathsome creature of the vampire.
Tesla said that they exist.
We must help him.
Yes.
This is absolutely the most fantastic thing I've ever read.
- Fantastic, Sir
Frederick, or unbelievable?
- Oh, I'm not gonna haggle phrases with you, Lady Jane.
This manuscript was discovered amongst the effects of Professor Saunders who died recently in a plane crash.
Its very serious implications can't be ignored.
My dear lady, you simply can't go around the country driving things through people's hearts.
I quite understand, Sir Frederick.
- This person that you and Professor Saunders disposed of, who was he?
Armand Tesla, the depraved Romanian scientist who died in 1744 shortly after he published his work on vampirism.
Tesla's morbid thirst for knowledge turned upon him and after his death, he himself became a vampire.
- Oh, rubbish, there's no such thing as a vampire.
You're wrong, Sir Frederick.
And Tesla's man Friday, this Andreas, what happened to him?
- For years, Tesla had him under complete hypnotic control.
But with Tesla's destruction, Andreas was released from this nightmare.
And after years of patient care and treatment, he was restored to normal.
Today, he's perfectly well and invaluable to me in my work.
My dear Lady Jane.
I have the greatest respect and admiration for you like everyone else in England, but you must remember that
I'm chief commissioner for Scotland Yard.
And as such, there's only one thing I can do.
That grave must be opened.
And if we discover the remains of a man with a spike through his heart, well, then I'm very much afraid that you will be liable to prosecution for murder.
Mother, I thought you were going to stop by the concert hall after you left Sir Frederick's office.
No, I came straight home.
Oh, Nicki dear.
- Hello.
- How did the rehearsal go?
- Oh, just so so.
That's informative.
They've really done him awfully proud.
- Honorably discharged from the Royal Air Force because of wounds received in a sweep over the channel.
Mr. Ainsley returns to music lovers of this city.
It is rather thrilling.
- Nicki made a perfect spectacle of herself.
She brought at least a dozen of them home with her.
I did not, it was two dozen.
I ask you, what can I do with him?
That's for you to find out.
After you're married I'll wash my hands of him entirely.
- You know you can't get rid of me that easily.
- I'd like to talk to you for a few moments.
Nicki won't mind, will you, dear?
I don't mind a bit.
- The wedding announcements are up in your room.
Thank you.
Come on.
So, that's what Sir Frederick wanted.
Yes.
When is he going to open the grave?
He'll call me.
And if they find a body?
- I shall be able to prove that Tesla was a vampire.
The body will not be decomposed.
- Are you worried?
- For myself, no.
For Nicki, yes.
I've always hoped that she would never know about this whole ghastly business.
If it's to come out into the open-
What is it, Andreas?
- Here is the blood report you asked for, milady.
- Andreas, did you hear what we were talking about?
No, sir.
- Here come the Jerries.
- You better call Nicki.
I shall want her if there are any casualties.
Blimey, look at this place.
It's getting so it ain't even safe to be dead.
Right.
So help me.
I ain't going to do nothing with him.
- The king expects every man to do his duty.
- Well why did they have to shove this blinkin' job onto me?
Well, I don't know why.
Look.
- Don't do that.
- There's a blasted spike stickin' out of his chest.
You know it ain't right for a man to be buried decent and proper like and then go and get hit by a bloomin' bomb splint.
That spike's gotta come out before we bury him again.
Yes.
Horace, pull it out yourself.
Chickenhearted is what you are.
What's that?
Come on, Horace.
Let's bury him and get it over with.
Yes, but which is his grave?
How do I know which is his grave?
He oughta consider himself lucky to have a grave.
- Yes.
- Come on.
Let's shove him in the blinkin' hole.
Yes?
Oh, that's splendid news, indeed.
Quite, I'll proceed exactly as with the others.
Goodbye.
Andreas, have you ever heard of Dr. Hugo Bruckner?
Bruckner?
Oh, yes, the famous scientist from Heidelberg.
He's a prisoner in some
German concentration camp.
He was a prisoner.
The underground are slipping him across the channel tonight.
They want me to make the same arrangement as with the others.
You want me to go to the coast, then on to the Professional Club with him?
- Yes, exactly the same arrangements hold good.
Be sure you carry all the necessary identification papers with you.
I have them all in good order, Doctor.
That's splendid.
I never met Dr. Bruckner, but I feel we're doing a good thing for humanity helping our fellow scientists escape the Nazi yoke.
You better get started.
- Yes, Doctor.
Dr. Ainsley.
I lied to you yesterday afternoon.
I did hear what you were saying about the grave.
His grave.
I see.
I'm afraid for Sir Frederick to open it.
Please, don't let them, Doctor.
- There's nothing I can do to stop him, Andreas.
Really, there's nothing for you to worry about.
Why, I know you're right, Doctor, but I wish they weren't going to do it.
Good night, Doctor.
Andreas.
Andreas.
Andreas.
Andreas.
Andreas.
You.
You have no power over me.
That was ended many years ago.
I'm no longer your slave.
Dr. Ainsley has cleansed me of all the evil you forced upon me.
You can't bring it back.
You can't.
I won't let you, I won't.
You're a fool, Andreas.
A complete, utter fool.
Your fate is to be what you are as mine is to be what I am, your master.
Come here.
I won't.
I won't.
Look at me, Andreas.
Look at me.
Andreas.
Come here.
Master, you have come back.
Lady Jane Ainsley and Professor
Walter Saunders imprisoned me.
Deprived me of life for the past 23 years.
It was my curse that caused
Professor Saunders's recent death.
It shall not be as simple for Lady Jane.
How will you do it, Master?
Through those she loves the most.
Come, Andreas.
I must find a new resting place.
There, you will bring the coffin with my native soil.
And then, Andreas, I have other plans.
Master.
- Well, you were successful?
- Yes, Master.
There were two men in the boat when it landed on the beach.
It was very dark, and they didn't see me.
Their bodies, Master, are lying at the bottom of the channel with rocks about their feet.
Here are his clothes.
His wallet.
His identification and his ring.
No one, not even Lady
Jane, will ever suspect.
Now, all that remains is for me to take you to the Professional Club where you will be welcomed as...
This is it.
But what about the vault?
Who took him out of there?
Professor Saunders and I took the coffin and buried it here, an unknown grave.
We were determined that no one should ever again find Tesla.
- You're absolutely certain this is the spot?
Oh, yes.
We mapped the location.
Between this one of Fairchild and this one here of Smidley.
This is, or rather was the grave, Sir Frederick.
That's right, sir.
There was an unmarked grave here, sir.
Copped a direct hit too and all.
Do you know anything about this grave?
- No, it was here when
I got here 12 years ago.
- All right, you can go.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, Lady Jane, now what?
The Jerries seem to have rather taken things out of your hands.
Yes, let's get back to the car.
Then you're going to drop the inquiry?
Well, you can't do much with a hole in the ground, can you?
There's Sir Frederick.
Excuse me a moment.
Oh, good evening, Lady Jane.
You know, if I hadn't known better
I should have thought that-
- That I was the bride.
- Yes, how'd you know I was going to say that?
I've been rehearsing it for an hour.
You forget women's intuition.
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.
I should have let you finish.
- About this manuscript of Professor Saunders, do you think I ought to give it to Nicki?
Oh.
After all, she is his granddaughter.
Oh, no, please, please let me have it.
I don't want her ever to know anything about it.
By Jove, perhaps you're right.
It is rather grim, isn't it?
- Good evening.
- Oh, good evening.
- I hear Dr. Bruckner's coming tonight, is that true?
Yes, do you know him?
- No, but he must be a queer sort of a duck.
They tell me at the club he sleeps all day and works all night.
Thank you, sir.
Dr. Bruckner.
Ah, Doctor, may I introduce myself?
I'm Lady Jane Ainsley.
- I have waited impatiently for this moment.
I owe you so much, Lady Ainsley.
Oh, this is Miss Nicki Saunders.
Dr. Hugo Bruckner.
And my son John Ainsley.
How do you do?
Charmed, indeed.
I understand this is an engagement party.
May I offer my congratulations and wish you, how do you say it in
England, all the best.
Thank you.
Have you been in London before, Doctor?
Years ago, for a very short while.
I saw a few people.
One of them was your grandfather,
Professor Walter Saunders.
Indeed?
Oh, you knew the professor?
I came in contact with him just once.
You were a very little girl.
- Now Doctor, I want you to meet Sir Frederick Fleet.
I shall be delighted.
Au revoir, young lady.
I shall see you again.
- I hope so.
- Complete understanding of fear psychosis is essential if you want to control the mind of another.
Sort of mind over matter business, what?
Precisely, Sir Frederick.
The mind is the greatest of all human forces.
Control the mind and you control the body.
- How right you are, Doctor.
- When I entered the grounds,
I noticed some buildings in the rear.
Yes, they house my patients, but the laboratory is just through here.
Would you care to see it?
- It would be a privilege.
If you'll excuse us, gentlemen.
We shan't be long.
Oh, Andreas.
What in the world are you doing here at this hour of the night?
- I thought I'd finish these tests, Doctor.
- I don't think I've ever had such a faithful technician.
I can never get him to go home.
- I think we both owe
Andreas a debt of gratitude.
- Well, as you can see, we're very well equipped here.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
You have a fascinating place, indeed.
- I should consider it an honor and a privilege if you would accept free run of this laboratory and of our hospital.
What do you say?
Thank you.
I accept your offer.
Splendid, Andreas, you will assist the doctor in every way you can.
I will, Doctor.
- Well, shall we go?
- Yes, indeed.
The lock's been forced.
I put the manuscript in this drawer.
It's odd, I grant you, but I shouldn't attach too much importance to it.
Only the two of us knew it was there.
No, I don't like it.
You're not suggesting your vampire friend's on the loose again, are you?
- I don't think it's a matter to be treated lightly.
What?
- I've been uneasy ever since we visited his grave.
Oh, I know what you're going to say, but just the same, we didn't find his body.
Oh, my dear lady, that's all over and done with.
Whoever took that manuscript is human and no spook.
You can bet your life on that, my dear.
Well, I'm afraid I must be trodding on right now.
I shouldn't worry too much about this business.
There's an explanation and we'll find it.
No, don't trouble to come to the door.
Please, good night.
Goodbye, thanks so much for coming.
Not at all.
I've got to thank you for an excellent dinner.
Thank you.
Good evening, Dr. Bruckner.
I am going to my room now.
Nobody must disturb me, nobody.
Do you understand?
I sleep during the day.
Quite, quite.
Well.
Nicki, I am waiting for you.
Come to me, Nicki.
I'm here, Nicki.
Nicki, come to me.
It is useless for you to struggle.
Come.
I am waiting for you.
Who are you?
Why have you forced me to come here?
You read your father's manuscript.
Look at me, Nicki.
Now tell me who I am.
You are Armand Tesla.
But Tesla is dead.
I am Tesla.
And I can never die.
And you are mine, mine forever.
But before I take you away from here. there are many things I will make you do for me.
Then you will go with me to my native country where no deaths can claim you or tear us apart.
Your mind is no longer your own.
I shall command and you shall obey.
Look at me, Nicki.
Look at me.
Lady Ainsley, come quickly.
Lady Ainsley.
Nicki.
What is it?
Call a nurse at once.
Yes, milady.
- Hurry.
- Yes, milady.
What's the matter with her?
Wait for me downstairs.
I'll be able to tell you more later.
It's ghastly.
Unbelievable.
A transfusion is all I can do for now.
- Let's take her right away from here, anywhere, miles away.
Now, don't get panicky, dear.
That won't help Nicki.
But something must be done.
Something is going to be done.
I understand from the caretaker that you are the two gentlemen. who helped clean up the cemetery after the big blitz.
Yes, we are that, ma'am.
Were many of the bodies disturbed?
- Well, maybe half a dozen, ma'am, more or less.
- Do you remember seeing one of an old man, a very old man with a spike in his heart?
Yes, we do, ma'am.
But how did you know?
Can you tell me what became of him?
We pulled the spike out, ma'am.
Did anything happen while you were pulling out the spike or afterward?
Yes, it did, ma'am.
We heard a sort of gasp, a low moan.
But it couldn't have been him, or could it?
What happened then?
We buried him again, ma'am.
All nice and cozy like.
Could you show me where?
Here.
Here we are, ma'am.
Blimey, he's 'opped it.
Law love a duck.
Who would go and steal a dead corpse?
Where did you get that ring?
I found it, ma'am.
It was laying there in the dirt.
Is it yours?
- Mine?
Oh, no.
No, it came off the corpse.
- Here, ma'am, have it with my compliments.
- Pardon me, ma'am, I've gotta go with Horace.
- I've been trying to tell you for the last hour it's no longer a question of accepting or believing.
Armand Tesla is alive.
You now have concrete evidence, his attack on Nicki.
Rubbish, my dear lady.
There's a natural explanation to this thing and I mean to find it.
I'll give you all the protection possible, but I will not believe in galloping ghosts.
Then there's no more to be said.
It's half past five.
I'll have to get back to Nicki before dark.
Is John going through with his concert tonight or is that all off?
John will be there.
Goodbye.
- Goodnight.
Lynch, I've got an idea.
Really, sir?
Yes, really.
- Splendid, sir.
- Oh leave that thing alone.
There's a man who assists her ladyship called Andreas Obry.
Hey, there, wait a minute!
We wanna have a talk with you.
- What have you got in that bundle, my lad?
Come on, hand it over.
Keep away from me.
That wasn't a man.
That was a wolf.
You say he was carrying this bundle?
Yes, sir.
Bruckner.
What happened then?
- We asked him to show us what was in the bundle.
First he seemed scared and then he jumped us, sir.
- You mean you two big men couldn't handle him?
- We did have the best of him, sir, until he-
He turned into a wolf, sir.
He did what?
- He turned into a wolf, sir, right in front of our eyes.
- First there are vampires then men in coffins disappear from the cemetery and now a man turns into a wolf.
You haven't by any chance a rabbit up your sleeve, have you?
Or an elephant in your hat?
What do you take me for?
For nothing, sir.
It's the truth, sir.
Show him.
What's this?
Hair, sir.
I pulled them out during the fight.
There can be no mistake, sir.
We saw it quite plainly.
What do you want?
- This report came from the laboratory earlier this evening.
You weren't in, sir.
It is the finding of this laboratory that the exhibit in this report taken from the Ainsley
Sanatorium is wolf hairs.
Well, of course, I may be crazy.
What are you doing, Elsa?
- Just drawing the blackout curtains, Miss Nicki so we can turn on the lights.
Leave them alone.
Don't you love the night and the darkness?
The soft, lovely darkness, there's so much mystery in it.
- For my part, Miss Nicki,
I prefer the daylight where one can see what's what.
Are you feeling better?
Very much better, Elsa.
Why don't you go get your supper?
I'll go later.
Lady Ainsley said you were not to be left alone.
Very well.
Nicki.
Nicki.
You must go to him.
Now, Nicki.
What's the matter with you?
Nicki, you shouldn't be out of bed.
Stop that, Stevie, I don't know what's the matter with him.
He never acted that way before with you.
Get out, get out, be quiet.
You shouldn't have left your room like this.
You knew I'd say goodbye before I went to the concert.
Nicki, Nicki, what's the matter?
Nicki?
I was afraid you'd forgotten.
I love you so very much.
Hello, Van, is everything all right?
I was delayed in the blackout.
Did Mr.John get off to the concert?
I believe so, milady, although
I didn't actually see him leave.
Excuse me.
Hello, yes, this is the Ainsley residence.
It's the concert hall, milady.
- Oh, I'll take it.
Hello, yes.
This is Lady Ainsley.
What?
I don't know anything about it.
I'll see about it at once.
That was the manager.
He says my son hasn't arrived at the hall.
See if he's in the library.
I'll go up to his room.
- Yes, milady.
John.
John?
John.
- Well, Dr. Bruckner, what have you to say about this?
Is this a police interrogation?
- Now look here sir, don't beat about the bush.
Do you believe this was an attack by a vampire?
- There are many strange things in the world, Sir Frederick.
Vampires may be one of them.
Ah.
- And you still say there is no such thing as a vampire?
I repeat, Armand Tesla is one and he lives.
With Nicki already in his power he has set out to destroy John too.
Heaven knows who may be his next victim.
Nicki, your eyes.
I never saw them so queer.
Stop staring at me like that.
Nicki.
Nicki.
Andreas.
Andreas, we'd like to speak to you for a few moments.
What do you want?
- Did you take a manuscript from my desk several nights ago?
A manuscript, Doctor?
I don't understand.
What were you doing outside the
Professional Club at three this morning?
Well?
Why are you asking me these questions?
Why are you looking at me like this?
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.
So now you know.
Yes, I took the manuscript.
Where is Armand Tesla?
I'll never tell.
You'll never find him no matter how hard you try.
You can never destroy the master.
He'll live forever.
And you're too late to save
John and the Saunders girl.
- Poor Andreas, what a tragedy to lose his soul again after struggling for so many years to find it.
- My dear Jane, how you can feel any sympathy for a creature like that is beyond me.
But don't you understand?
He's not responsible for his actions while under the domination of Tesla.
- Anyway, my men will pick him up within an hour.
In the meantime, dear lady, you better come along with me.
I have a surprise for you.
Never mind your orders.
I'm Sir Frederick Fleet of Scotland Yard.
I'll take you to his room, sir.
Thanks.
It looks as though he was asleep, doesn't it?
I can't understand it, sir.
He came in a little before daylight and he hasn't gone out.
I'm sure of that.
Perhaps he sleeps under the bed.
Oh, no, sir.
He'd hardly do that.
What about the fire escape?
There is none, sir.
And it's a three-story drop from here to the ground.
- Well, he may be somewhere in the building.
Make inquiries, will you?
- Certainly, sir.
- May I ask why this sudden interest in Dr. Bruckner?
Oh, it's not sudden, dear lady.
I've been interested in the gentleman from the start.
Would you like to hear my little surprise?
Bruckner, Hugo.
Age, 62.
- Mm-hm.
Bald, heavily built and walks with a limp.
There's your real Dr. Bruckner.
Then who is this man?
A very fishy customer.
And that monstrosity Andreas is somehow tied up with him.
- Sir Frederick.
- Mm-hm?
Now I have a little surprise for you.
Do you notice anything peculiar about this room?
No.
By Jove, yes.
It's not broken.
I wonder who'd turn a mirror to the wall like that.
Hello, what's this?
That ring belonged to Armand Tesla.
I got it from a laborer at the cemetery after the bombing.
You'll remember, I showed it to you at your office.
Yes, I remember.
Dr. Bruckner stole it then?
- Oh, no he didn't.
It belongs to him.
That ring proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Dr. Bruckner is
Armand Tesla, vampire, whose face casts no reflection.
That's why he turned the mirror to the wall.
I must know about John.
Don't worry about John.
He's going to be all right.
Does he know everything?
He knows and understands.
What did he say?
He said he loves you very much.
- How much longer can he go on loving me knowing that I-
But John has always loved you.
He always will no matter what happens.
The sun is going down, isn't it?
Oh, if I could only hold back the night, keep it from getting dark.
That's when I hear those voices whispering to me, telling me what to do.
If there were only some way to stop this terrible thing.
Lady Jane, you've got to help me.
I will, darling, I will.
Nicki, Nicki, look at me.
I want you to answer just one question, is Dr. Bruckner Armand Tesla?
I don't know, I don't know.
All I can hear is that voice.
Then my mind seems to go.
I think I've found the answer.
Only it may involve terrible risk for you.
I don't care about myself.
Anything, just so long as John is safe.
May I keep this for the time being?
If you wish.
Thank you, dear.
Just trust me.
- Come along, Elsa.
- But milady-
Don't ask any questions.
Just come along.
- Sir, Peters.
- Yes, sir.
Dr. Bruckner, I didn't see you come in.
I didn't come in, Peters.
I haven't been out.
Are there any messages?
- No, sir.
Can you be reached at Dr. Ainsley's?
I shall be there.
Whether I can be reached is quite another matter.
- Where did he go?
- Where did who go?
Bruckner, the chap we're after.
Nobody came out this way.
Why, he just stepped out this door.
Not this door, he didn't.
Now, look here, with my own very eyes, these here in the middle of my face.
I just saw him come out.
And I say nobody came out.
- I'm not going to like it when
Sir Frederick hears of this.
Good evening, Lady Ainsley.
I've been expecting you, Dr. Bruckner.
- So at last through Andreas, you learned who I am.
How great must be your satisfaction to realize how well you cured him.
There is good in Andreas's soul, good that I have placed there and which even you cannot destroy, Armand Tesla.
What a fool you are.
With all of your scientific knowledge you have achieved nothing.
You are too late to stop what I have set out to do.
I have waited for this moment for a long time.
Tonight I will take Nicki away.
Her soul will wander through the night and you will never find where her body rests.
And then, in another form she will come back for John.
You're lying.
You attacked my son and made
Nicki believe that she did it.
You're a very brilliant woman.
But a foolish one to pit your strength against mine.
It is possible that you may take Nicki, but there is something stronger than even you.
Something greater that you have forgotten.
You are evil.
But even the power of evil cannot stand against the power of faith and goodness.
And with that power, you will be destroyed.
Lady Jane.
Is everything all right?
- Bruckner was here.
- Already?
Well, he won't get out of the house.
I've got the whole place surrounded.
You won't take him that way.
If you don't listen to me now, you'll never take him.
Nicki.
The time has come.
I am waiting for you.
You must follow my voice.
Nothing can keep you from me.
Follow my voice.
Nothing can keep you from me.
Follow my voice.
Follow.
- I've listened to your ridiculous theories long enough.
I'm out to capture two men and I'm going to get them.
But Sir Frederick I-
Wait.
She's under the hypnotic control of Bruckner.
Oh, nonsense.
There's only one way to find him and that's for Nicki to lead us to his grave herself.
- But Jane-
- Now you listen to me.
I may be risking her life as well as my son's, but it's our only salvation.
We must follow her.
It's my way or none at all.
- But it's preposterous.
I tell you it's the only way.
Are you going to help me follow her or do I have to see this through alone?
All right.
The night is our friend, Nicki.
I will protect you and bring you to me.
Bring you to me.
Bring.
You're almost to me, Nicki, just a little further.
Just a little further.
Further.
Closer, Nicki.
Closer.
And we will be together, just you and I, together.
For heaven's sake, Sir Frederick.
Don't shoot again.
Pick her up, pick her up.
Nicki!
Nicki!
Nicki, Nicki!
Oh Sir Frederick, we've lost them.
Help me, Master.
I'm hurt.
What is that to me?
But I'll die.
You must not let that happen, Master.
You promised me life eternal.
Like yours, forever.
I no longer need you, Andreas.
Your usefulness is over.
You must not say that, Master.
Get away from me.
Idiot.
Get back to that corner.
Remain there to die.
There is no power great enough to keep you from me.
I have won.
You are saved, Andreas.
Because I have taught you the meaning of goodness.
You hold it now, locked tightly in your heart.
And nothing evil can ever stand against it again.
Always remember that goodness is the strongest force in the world and that all evil cannot prevail against it.
Remember that and you will be strong.
Strong.
Andreas, go back, go back.
I'm your master.
You must obey.
Go back.
You are my master no longer.
You are evil.
You must be destroyed.
For years I've lived in terror of you.
I'd wake up screaming in the night because I thought you'd come back.
And I was your slave again. because I forgot what Dr.
Ainsley had taught me.
But now that is over.
I am going to destroy you forever.
- Every member of the force is looking for them.
- They must be found before daylight or it will be too late.
- You've fought every move I've tried to make in this case.
You've got some silly absurd notion-
Oh, please.
Yes, what?
Whereabouts?
Right.
They've found them.
- Oh, thank heaven.
Oh, Nicki.
- Lady Jane.
- Where are the other two?
- Over here, sir.
Lady Jane, it was Andreas.
He destroyed him.
Andreas.
I'll be home soon, darling.
Well, there's one of them, Andreas.
Doesn't look much like a werewolf now, does he?
He isn't now, poor Andreas.
He found his soul after all.
May he have peace forever.
But who this blighter is, I don't know.
He looks to me more like a bundle of rags and bones.
Looks as if he'd been lying there for some time.
That, my dear Sir Frederick, is all that is left of Armand Tesla.
Now do you believe in vampires?
- My dear Jane, must you go back over all that?
Very well, then.
If it isn't Tesla or Bruckner perhaps you'll tell me who it is.
Say, you fellas don't believe in this vampire business, do you?
Yes, sir, we do.
And do you people?
This is the Inner Sanctum.
A strange, fantastic world controlled by a mass of living, pulsating flesh, the mind.
It destroys, distorts, creates monsters, commits murder.
Yes.
Even you, without knowing, can commit murder.
That'll be all for today, Tanya.
But there's still a good light and I'm not tired.
I know. You're never tired. But I have a dinner engagement tonight.
With her?
Yes, with Heather.
Now, run along and get changed.
She'll be here in a minute.
Well, hello, brat.
It's about time.
Hello, darling. Am I late?
No, I just stopped working.
I'm so anxious to see the painting.
Dave, it's wonderful.
Thanks.
We're meeting your dad for dinner tonight, aren't we?
Darling, why don't we forget this family affair and go someplace together, just us.
Oh, no.
We couldn't do that.
Why, I haven't seen Dad Hayden in weeks.
Listen, are you marrying my father or me?
Why, your father, of course.
With all his dough?
Dave, darling.
But after that,
I'll do anything you say.
Of course, I really should be jealous of your model.
And Dad thinks I should chaperone you. No.
But here she is now.
Heather, this is Tanya,
Miss Czoraki.
Dave, she's just as lovely as your painting. How do you do?
I must be going, goodbye.
Goodbye, Tanya.
Strange little thing, isn't she? Yes, but an excellent model.
She's in love with you. I could tell by the way she looked at us.
Nonsense, darling.
You're a jealous woman.
Well, if she isn't, she ought to be.
And maybe I had better chaperone you.
Or better yet, marry you right away.
Not right away.
But just as soon as
I finish this painting.
I believe it's going to be the best thing I've ever done.
It'll make me, professionally.
Then I can support a rich man's daughter.
Well, I've waited this long, I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now, go on and get your clothes on. We're gonna celebrate!
Well, Alan. How are you?
Fine. Fine.
Where is she?
She hasn't gone yet, has she?
Who, Tanya? No, but you almost missed her today.
She'll be out in a minute.
Oh.
Dad Hayden told me the news about you and Heather. Congratulations.
Thanks.
Dave, it's becoming more beautiful every day.
It's a wonderful piece of work, almost as fascinating as the original.
Thanks, again.
She's lovely.
Quiet and shy as a child.
And yet there's something primitive and passionate about her.
She intrigues me.
That's quite obvious from the way you've been monopolizing her time.
Well, after all, I'm a connoisseur of art and beauty.
Mostly beauty, I'd say.
Oh, but that's not fair. I'm interested in people, too.
It's part of my profession to study them.
Learn what causes them to act as they do.
Oh, so that's why you've been so interested in my model.
Yes, it's the mystery of what's going on inside her.
For instance, I wonder what she's thinking about now.
I wonder.
Tanya, is anything wrong?
Oh, hello, Alan.
What's happened? You don't seem very glad to see me.
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I guess I'm just a little tired.
Oh, Dave's a slave driver.
Now, as a doctor and a psychiatrist,
I prescribe play and relaxation under my personal guidance.
We'll have dinner, take in a nightclub...
Not tonight, Alan, thank you.
I think I should get some rest.
Well, then at least
I'll see you home.
Same time tomorrow, Tanya.
Yes. Good night.
Good night. So long,
Alan. Goodbye, Dave.
A doctor! Quick, get me a doctor!
I'm going blind.
Sure, I get it.
I was good enough to take you out and show you a good time.
But now I'm getting the brushoff.
Oh, Nick, I'm sorry.
I like you.
I've always liked you.
But now that Dave and I are... Well, our wedding day's practically set.
It isn't the thing for us to be running around together.
It's your father, he's responsible for this. Oh, I know he doesn't like me.
He's had his heart set on you marrying
Dave ever since you were just a little kid.
And you're only doing it because he wants you to.
It so happens that I have a mind of my own and I'm in love with Dave.
I've always been in love with him.
Oh, but Heather...
Dad's right. You really shouldn't call at the house any more.
It doesn't look good.
No, nothing ever looks good to him.
Telephone, Miss Heather.
Thank you, Trevers.
Yes?
An accident?
His eyes?
Why don't they let us in to see him? Now, father...
After all, there's nothing to get excited about.
It can't be anything really serious.
Oh, nothing's ever serious to you.
What are you doing here, anyway?
This is none of your affair.
Nick was with me when we received the news.
Oh, I thought you were going to stay away from him now that you've landed a real man.
Well, well, what is it? Speak up, Sam. What's the matter?
Dave used acid on his eyes instead of eyewash, by mistake.
His eyes are badly burned.
And I'm afraid the corneas are permanently damaged.
You mean he's blind?
Yes, leukoma.
Dad!
Can anything be done?
Well, I can't say for sure.
It's too early to tell.
But you've got to do something, man.
That boy is like my own son. He's an artist, a painter, he needs his eyes.
You're supposed to be one of the best eye men in the country. Do something.
I'll do everything I can.
When may we see him?
Tomorrow. I've given him a sedative and he's asleep now.
His mental state will not be good for a while.
When I bring him home, someone should be there to greet him.
And he shouldn't be left alone for some time.
We'll see to that. I'll get
Alan Bittaker. He'll help.
Yes, yes, that's good.
He'll know what to do.
Yes, we'll all be there.
No, we won't.
It was my fault, my fault.
Your fault?
I might have known.
Yes. I remember moving the bottles.
By mistake he must've picked up the wrong one thinking it was the eyewash.
By mistake? I doubt it.
You... I didn't mean to do it.
I didn't realize, I didn't know. It was an accident.
Accident? Yes. Yes,
Dad Hayden, an accident.
I was here at the time, there was nothing intentional about it.
Please. You must believe me, please.
You, you...
Dave.
Heather?
What're you doing here?
You have company.
Yes. Dad's here, and Alan and...
Hello Dave.
Oh, Alan.
Did you think I'd need a psychiatrist, coming home like this?
Why, nonsense. I'm just on hand as a friend.
We thought it'd be better waiting here than all coming to the hospital.
Come on, darling.
Oh, Dave.
Hello, son.
Dad Hayden.
I might have known you'd be here for my homecoming.
Dumb stunt I pulled, wasn't it? It wasn't your fault.
Welcome home, Dave.
Oh, Tanya.
That's fine.
Come along, darling.
Here we are.
Dave, why don't you plan to come home with us for a while?
What? What?
I'm blind, I know it!
Why doesn't someone say something about it? Are you afraid to talk about it?
Dave, darling.
Of course we know you're blind. And if you wanna talk about it, we will.
It's a dirty shame.
I'm sorry I went overboard like that.
I guess there's no use crying over spilt milk, is there?
Forget it, will you?
Dave, I don't want to give you any false hope, but there is an operation known as corneal transplant.
Oh, Doctor, you mean there's a chance?
Yes, there is a chance.
But it's a very slim chance.
In the first place, the operation is a most delicate eye surgery.
And in Dave's case, the injury is so extensive, it's doubtful whether large enough grafts of corneal tissue could be made successfully.
You mean you can take the tissue from one set of eyes and graft it onto another?
Yes, in the case of the cornea, you can.
The cornea is like a window which admits light to the lens of the eye through which it's focused on the retina.
And the cornea is the only part of the human eye which can be transplanted from one person to another and retain life.
But too large a graft can't be made or the eyeball might collapse.
Then at least you can try.
Well, it's...
It's not as simple as all that.
You see, another human eye is needed.
One whose cornea is undamaged, from which the necessary grafts may be taken.
As you can imagine, such eyes are scarce and difficult to obtain.
And an eye removed from a donor must be placed in cold storage immediately and used within 72 hours.
Otherwise, the live tissue deteriorates and will not graft.
There are organizations such as the Donor Society, where eyes may be obtained for just such an operation.
Eyes that were removed because of other defects, though the corneas remained undamaged.
Or eyes taken from dead men.
Yes, that is true, but the applicants are always more numerous than the supply.
And you must furnish the opinion of an eye specialist that the transplant will be a success.
As the surgeon, in this case, I'm afraid,
I cannot give that as my true opinion.
So Dave's application would be delayed indefinitely.
Then Doctor, you really mean there isn't any hope?
I wouldn't say that, Dave.
As a matter of fact...
Dr. Welles, would a single eye do?
To take care of both of Dave's? Yes, yes.
Doctor, are you suggesting that someone here donate one of his eyes?
I'm suggesting nothing, my son.
I'm simply stating the facts.
Do you think that I would allow anyone to disfigure themselves, when you can give me no real assurance that this operation would be a success?
No, Dave,
I am sure you wouldn't.
Well, I won't allow it.
Not anyone, no matter who.
But Dave...
No!
We'll locate someone who's forced to part with an eye and who will be a willing donor.
I'll offer payment.
I don't want you to do that, Dad Hayden.
You've done enough for me already.
Nonsense.
In the meantime, we're getting a nurse out here to look after you for a few days.
You don't have to worry about a thing,
Dave. I'll take care of all the expenses.
No, I don't want that!
I don't want a nurse!
I can take care of myself.
You really should have someone here for a day or two, Dave.
I'll be here.
I'll be glad to come in every day and look after Dave.
I want to do it.
I feel I should.
Tanya, well, that's swell of you.
It won't be for very long.
Only for a few days, until
I can find my own way about.
Sitting here like a slug on a rock,
a useless hulk of humanity.
Listening to music, to someone else create something,
while I...
I'll never paint again.
Never again.
Tanya, is your painting still uncovered?
Yes.
Then cover it.
But Dave... I'll never be able to finish it.
I don't want it out where everyone can look at it and comment on it.
It's the only good thing
I've ever done.
I'll never be able to finish the only good thing I've ever done.
I'm sorry.
Why do you have to be so everlastingly sorry about everything?
You're not to blame!
It was a stupid accident.
I did it!
It was the painting I meant. Oh.
Don't pay any attention to me,
Tanya. I'm upset.
I understand.
I'll be going now. Good night.
Heather's fine.
We weren't to be married until the painting was finished.
But she'll want to go through with it anyway.
Got to break it off.
She and Nick.
At least he isn't blind.
Oh, David Stuart.
I don't believe you. You don't know what you're saying.
But I do know what I'm saying.
Our engagement was a mistake.
I came here to release you from your obligation to me.
Are you trying to play the martyr with me?
David, I love you.
I'm not gonna stand for your being noble. It isn't that, I...
I just discovered that I don't love you. Not that way.
Dave.
David!
Why do you have to make this so difficult for me?
Can't you realize I'm not in love with you? I'm in love with...
Well, I'm in love with Tanya.
And under the circumstances, I should think you'd step aside gracefully.
Is this her idea?
Did Tanya send you here tonight? Leave her out of this.
Dave, do you know that she's responsible for the loss of your sight?
I told you to leave her out of this. It was an accident.
She feels badly enough about it as it is.
Very well.
What do you want me to do?
Why, nothing...
I simply had to tell you the truth. Get it off my mind.
Get things settled between us.
But, we can go on like we were before, can't we, brat?
All right, Dave.
Anything you say.
You've been mighty decent,
Heather. I feel like a heel.
Good night.
Good night, Dave.
Oh, Dave!
Dave.
Dave!
You're a pretty sight.
Dad Hayden.
What're you doing here at this time of the night?
Night? It's morning.
Oh.
I wanna have a talk with you.
Where's that girl?
Tanya? Why, I guess she isn't here yet.
I came here as soon as I could...
As soon as I learned...
I don't care to discuss it.
Oh, you don't care to discuss it? Well, I do.
Where's your backbone?
Stand up and fight, man.
Drinking isn't gonna help you. It's no use.
I'm not going to stand idly by watching you waste yourself on that...
Let's leave Tanya out of this.
I can't leave her out of it.
I'm not going to let her come between you and Heather.
Oh, Dad, why do you want to burden Heather with a blind man?
Suppose you are blind, that doesn't mean you always will be.
There's hope.
Hope.
Now listen.
I'm an old man.
I'm not going to live forever.
And I've made arrangements with my lawyers that immediately on my death, my eyes are to be used to restore your sight.
You mean that you want them to use your eyes after...
Dr. Welles tells me they can, if they do it within a reasonable time.
Oh, no, Dad, that's no good.
It's too horrible to contemplate.
So you're determined to be the martyr, eh?
Dad, I don't want to hurt you, or Heather either.
But what I told her about
Tanya and me is the truth.
Well, I had to be fair.
You're not gonna throw yourself away on that scheming little adventuress.
I won't allow it.
I thought I told you to leave Tanya out of this.
If I can't bring you to your senses any other way, I'll see what can be done about prosecuting her for deliberately scheming to cause your blindness.
I'll jail her for it if it's the last thing I do!
Why don't you mind your own business?
Now get out of here and let me alone!
Dave.
Dave.
Oh, Dave.
Oh, Alan, I'm so glad you're here.
I came as soon as
I got your call.
Here now, what's this?
Things can't be that bad.
Oh, but they are.
Dave's been drinking.
And then I heard him in the bedroom, he was crying and sobbing.
It was awful.
Well, Dave's bound to be difficult.
He's going through a torturous period of adjustment.
But you really wanna know what's the matter with him? It's Heather.
He broke his engagement to her last night. He broke off his engagement?
Yes. But if Dave weren't blind, he'd crawl back to her on his hands and knees.
As long as Dave doesn't have his sight, he'll never marry Heather.
Tanya, listen to me.
You can't give your life to Dave through a mistaken sense of responsibility.
He belongs with Heather.
He doesn't love you. I do.
You?
Yes.
Why do you think I kept coming up here so often?
But I thought Dave, the painting... No, it was you.
You're in my blood, Tanya. I can't think of anything else.
Oh, Alan, I'm sorry.
I do like you.
But, well, as long as Dave needs me,
I could never think of anyone else.
But it's all wrong, Tanya.
It'll never work out for you.
You mean because of Mr. Hayden? Yes.
Don't forget, he's been like a father to Dave. He'll influence him.
That's not so.
Only this morning, Dave quarreled with him over me.
And Dave told him to get out.
I'm going to see Mr. Hayden and put a stop to this.
He's got to leave Dave alone.
No, Tanya, that won't do any good.
Well, I'm going to see him anyway.
How are you, old boy?
Oh, Alan.
What are you doing here? I just dropped in to see you.
Oh, that's fine.
How about a drink?
Now, don't you think you've had about enough, fellow?
Are you gonna start preaching too? No, no, of course not.
I'll join you in a nightcap.
That's fine.
Would you mind pouring it?
Gee, I've got a bad taste in my mouth.
You'll pardon me for pointing this out to you, but you're not gonna get rid of that taste by taking another drink.
You see, I know what's bothering you, my boy.
What do you mean? It's a bad case of guilty conscience.
You treated Dad Hayden pretty roughly and you know it.
It's preying on your mind, isn't it?
Come on, admit it.
Confession's good for the soul. Get it off your chest.
Yes, I...
I feel like a heel. Practically threw him out of here.
But I'm getting sick of everyone being sorry for me.
All this sympathy.
Yes, I know.
But you and Hayden have been too close to let anything come between you now.
Dave, you're acting like a man who's lost everything.
You heard what Dr. Welles said. There's still hope.
Yes, I know.
Now what you should do is to patch things up with Dad Hayden.
Decide to do that and I'll bet you'll sleep much better tonight.
How about it?
Of course, you're right.
Very well, I'll do it tonight.
Good. Now that that's settled,
I'll be on my way.
How about another drink?
No, thanks. See you later.
Alan's right.
There is hope.
When Dad Hayden dies,
I'll have the operation.
It might be a success.
If Dad Hayden were dead.
Good evening, Mr. Phillips.
Oh, hello, George.
Have you seen Miss Hayden?
Yes, sir. She's waiting at the far end table.
Has she been here long? About three quarters of an hour, sir.
You're late, Nick.
What kept you?
I'm sorry, Heather. I was on my way over here and... But I ran into...
Skip the excuses, Nick.
Why did you drag me away from the house tonight? What's so important?
Heather, I just had to see you alone.
I know this isn't the time or the place, but...
But...
But what?
Straight Bourbon.
Yes, sir.
Heather, you know how I feel about you. And now that Dave is...
I don't know how to say it, but, he won't hold you.
I want you to forget your pity and marry me.
Pity?
What on earth are you talking about?
Can't you possible understand
I'm in love with him?
I don't believe it.
The only thing that stands in our way is your father.
He's just a stubborn, meddlesome old man.
That's enough, Nick!
I didn't come here tonight to hear my father insulted.
And no matter what Dad thinks,
I still love Dave.
And I'm sure he really loves me. Good night.
Oh, but Heather...
Dave!
Dave, what happened?
Heather, I came over to make things right with Dad Hayden tonight, and...
Well, no one answered the door, and I let myself in with my own key.
Then I came in to find him and...
I stumbled over.
Dad!
Dad!
He's dead!
There's blood on your hands.
Heather, I...
Don't come near me.
Heather, you don't think that I...
No!
Heather!
How can you ask me to do such a thing?
Such a disfigurement would be horrible enough under ordinary circumstances.
But now...
It was your father's wish,
Heather.
But not this way.
Not when Dave...
Didn't I see him with my own eyes, standing there with Dad's blood on his hands?
How can you ask this of me?
I'm sorry, Heather. Under the circumstances, it's distressing to me, too.
But I promised your father I'd perform the necessary surgery.
Regardless of how we feel,
I think it should be done.
Miss Hayden, painful as this request must seem, legally you cannot prevent this procedure and neither can we.
Because I have definite instructions from your father in writing, witnessed by Dr. Welles.
Your consent is only a matter of form.
But Dr. Welles would rather not proceed without it.
Oh, I can't.
I simply can't.
Heather, you understand it's urgent that we act at once.
According to precepts of justice,
David Stuart is considered innocent until given a fair trial and condemned by an impartial jury.
And you in your present state could hardly be considered impartial.
Sorry, sir, but you can't go in there.
I'm a friend of Dave Stuart's.
How is he, Officer? Do you know?
I don't know, sir.
I'm Captain Drury.
What did you say your name was? Alan Bittaker.
Oh, yes. I've heard of you.
A psychiatrist, aren't you?
Well, in a small way.
Interesting, Doctor. You know, we use a bit of psychology in our business too.
What do you make of Stuart?
As a psychiatrist, I mean.
Well, just what do you mean?
Well, his state of mind, his frustrations in being unable to paint.
Blindness is a serious thing to happen to an artist.
Do you suppose it might drive him to commit murder?
I can't believe it.
He regarded Hayden as he would his own father.
Oh, yes, I know. But the mind is a strange thing.
Sometimes it slips out of control in a crisis.
But who am I to tell you?
Where's Dr. Welles?
When's he going to operate?
I think he's still at the morgue, removing Hayden's eyes.
But he should be here grafting the corneas by now.
Why worry, Doctor? Suppose the operation is too late?
After all, isn't it rather a waste of time, attempting to restore the vision of a man who may be condemned to die?
You're an inhuman, cold-blooded fish.
That's right, Doctor. You have to be, in my business.
Taxi! Taxi!
Wait a minute.
Give me that container.
Come, Tanya. There's no time to lose. Give it to me.
How did you find out?
I was at the hospital when Dr. Welles telephoned.
And I suspected you the minute I heard what happened. Now give them to me.
Tanya, keeping Dave blind isn't gonna hold him for you.
Don't you see in his heart he'll always continue to love Heather?
No. I will not believe that.
And you want him blind?
No, I don't want Dave blind.
Go, hurry. I don't want Dave blind. I don't know why I did it. I don't know why.
I think you're right, Doctor.
Now where's Moriarty?
I told him not to leave here.
Well, for...
Here's the missing container!
Where did it come from?
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
I thought I told you not to leave here. Where have you been?
Why, you see, sir, I was sitting over there, and then all of a sudden...
Oh, yes, yes, all right. Where did you get that container?
What container? The one we found on the chair.
You know, the container with the eyes. A container with eyes?
Why, Chief, the only thing that
I saw that had eyes was the...
Hello, Captain.
Better not go in there now.
I think they're getting him ready for the operation.
Well, what about the missing eyes?
They showed up rather mysteriously.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you, Bittaker?
No, no, I wouldn't.
Heather.
Don't come near me.
You don't think I...
There's blood on your hands.
No!
Heather, come back!
Heather. Heather!
You must lie still, boy.
You must not move your head.
You must not move your head.
You must not move your head.
How long?
Doctor, is there a chance?
Do you really think I'll see?
Take it easy, son.
If I could only be sure.
Hurry, won't you?
Please be calm.
This will only take a moment.
Now, Dave, let your eyes open slowly, only to slits, so that they can gradually become accustomed to the light.
All right.
Yes.
It's dark.
Is it dark in here?
Nurse, open the blinds.
How's that?
I'm blind.
I'm still blind.
I can't see.
I can't see. Now, now, just a minute, Dave.
Sometimes the first shock of daylight does that.
It takes a little while to wear off.
No. I know. I'm blind.
No, it's too early to tell yet. Now, hold still.
Alan?
Yes, Dave?
I'm blind.
Do you hear? I'm still blind.
Dave, I know anything I might tell you now will mean very little to you.
But you're free to go home.
Go home? Heather was responsible for it.
Heather?
Yes.
At the inquest the other day, she mentioned that she met Nick at a cocktail lounge the night that Dad Hayden was killed.
But Nick? They don't suspect him, do they?
Yes. She eliminated his alibi by telling them he was late.
Further examination established the fact that he had the opportunity and a motive.
And although you're still considered a suspect too, at least she helped establish a reasonable doubt of your guilt.
But does Heather still think that I killed Dad Hayden?
She can't be sure of anything, now.
Then why hasn't she been to see me?
She must still think that I... Give her time. She's had several shocks.
If I could only see again.
I owe so many people so much. Nonsense.
Now be calm, everything's going to be all right.
We'll be going home soon.
A nail.
A little threaded nail.
Where did I get it?
Now I remember.
It was on the carpet near his head
I must have dropped it into my pocket and forgotten all about it.
I wonder if it means anything.
Who is it?
Is that you, Tanya?
No, it's not Tanya.
She's gone. I've been waiting for her to leave.
Who are you? Remember me? I'm Captain Drury.
Oh, yes.
My old friend, Drury.
Nice, comfortable place you have here.
How did you get in?
Wasn't the door locked?
Oh, well, I didn't want to disturb you by ringing the bell.
Oh, what do you want?
Thanks, I'll make myself comfortable.
What do you know about that little model who left here?
Who, Tanya? Nothing, why?
Spends a lot of time here. She's kind of crazy about you, isn't she?
Not really.
It's just a sense of mistaken responsibility. Because...
Because she caused your blindness, indirectly?
Or did she mean to do it?
No, of course she didn't. It was a stupid mistake on my part.
But she does feel responsible, eh?
She and old man Hayden didn't get along very well, did they?
No, he didn't approve of her.
But that was because he didn't understand.
She has no alibi for the evening Hayden's death.
After she left here, she said she went directly home.
But she could have stopped at
Hayden's place on the way, huh?
That's ridiculous.
Well, maybe so.
But I should think, in your position, you'd be rather anxious to pin this murder on somebody else.
After all, you're still my favorite suspect.
What about Nick Phillips?
I thought...
I haven't ruled Nick Phillips out or anybody else, yet.
What do you know about Alan Bittaker?
Alan? He's one of my oldest friends.
What possible connection could he have with this case?
Did you know that somebody stole Hayden's eyes just after Doc Welles removed them from the body?
No.
They later turned up at the hospital rather mysteriously.
It's my opinion that Tanya took them.
And that Bittaker got them from her and returned them.
But why?
As long as you're blind, you remain dependant upon Tanya.
And I think she rather likes it that way.
She knows that if you regain your sight, she'll lose you to Miss Hayden.
So she tried to prevent the operation.
But Bittaker intervened and returned the eyes.
He was afraid she might get into trouble, so he did it anonymously.
I don't believe it!
It's a nice theory though, isn't it?
Well, you'll be seeing me.
Oh, Nick. I wish you'd go.
I'm expecting Alan.
But Heather, you must listen to me. How could you do it?
Do what? Implicate me!
Practically incriminate me!
I tell you, I'm innocent.
Heather, you don't believe that, do you?
Nick, I'm so mixed up,
I don't know what to think.
Please go.
But, Heather...
Hello, Heather.
Hello, Alan.
Hello, Nick.
Heather, I'd like to talk to you. About Dave, I suppose?
Oh, Nick! For heaven's sake, will you please get out of here?
Oh, so now you're going to kick me out?
Oh, nonsense!
This girl is upset.
Quit tormenting her and have the decency to leave when she asks you to.
You're against me, too.
You're all against me.
Heather, you must go and see Dave.
Oh, Alan, I can't.
He needs you, Heather.
I know in your heart you want to believe him innocent.
But he thinks you believe him guilty.
Alan, I don't know. I'm so confused, I'm not sure of anything.
Well, think it over. At least you should be willing to reserve judgment.
If you don't see him and later he's proved innocent, you'll never forgive yourself.
Yes, I suppose you're right, Alan.
But I must have time to collect myself.
She's spying, spying on me.
She's been acting strangely all day.
Tanya.
Yes?
Come here.
What do you want?
Are you in a hurry to leave?
Yes. I have a dinner engagement, with a man.
Before you go, I'd like to show you something.
What is it?
Something that I think should interest you.
Does that mean anything to you?
No. Why should it?
Because I found it next to Dad Hayden's body the night he was murdered.
I know nothing about it.
How should I? You tell me.
I don't know what it is.
I don't.
I must go now. I'm late.
Look here, if something's troubling you, I'd like to know it.
You can confide in me.
It's just David.
What's he done now? Nothing.
But I think he suspects me.
You didn't tell him about what
I... No, I didn't tell him.
He still thinks only of
Heather. Oh, so that's it?
You realize he still loves Heather. You're jealous.
Yes. I hate her. Now, you mustn't talk like that.
That's what you said about her father and...
Well, isn't this a cozy little twosome.
So this is why you're trying to patch things up between Heather and Dave.
Don't make a fool of yourself, Nick.
There's a method to your madness, Dr. Bittaker.
Now go away before you create a scene. Yes, Dr. Bittaker.
And how is our poor, blind, murdering patient tonight?
Better, I trust?
He's not the murderer.
He's as guilty as sin and I'm going to prove it.
No, Alan. Please.
Take me home.
Check, please.
Thank you, sir.
Good night, all.
There they are, boss.
Should I follow them again?
Yes. Don't let them get away from you.
Heather? Miss Hayden?
Yes, who is this?
Tanya? What is it?
What do you want?
Miss Hayden, I think I know who killed your father.
I should have called the police, but well, I think you're the one to decide.
You know who...
Whom do you mean?
No!
Tanya? Tanya!
No! Don't come near me!
Hello! Hello!
Hello?
Hello? I want the police.
Tanya? Come in.
It's not Tanya.
The door's locked.
Drury.
So you were expecting
Tanya, were you? Not exactly.
You see, she left here yesterday in a bad humor.
I don't know whether she is coming back.
She left in a bad humor, did she?
What's the matter, did you have a fight?
Not really.
She's a moody person.
She was sulking.
About what?
I don't know. Not that it's any of your business.
Do you know if she had any reason for calling Miss Hayden on the telephone last night?
She did? Well, she's very unpredictable.
She's unpredictable?
She got herself murdered last night. What?
Murdered. Struck down by the well-known blunt instrument.
She got hers the same way Hayden got his.
Where? What's that got to do with her telephoning Heather?
She telephoned Miss Hayden because she'd learned, or she suspected the true identity of the person who killed her father.
But before she could tell what she knew she got it.
Why wasn't I told about this before?
'Cause I didn't want to disturb you.
I instructed Miss Hayden not to call anyone until we checked on the
Czoraki girl's apartment.
Where were you last night, Stuart?
I was here, asleep.
Oh, is that so?
We had a report that a man was seen leaving this building, following Tanya last night.
It was getting dark about then, so the man wasn't identified.
Of course, it couldn't have been you. This man could see.
We're looking for the driver who picked him up, to get a better identification.
Take off your glasses, Stuart.
What are you trying to do, burn me? You sure you can't see?
I heard you strike a match.
Felt the heat.
What did Tanya Czoraki know?
I don't know.
She was a good-looker, wasn't she?
One of those dark, mysterious kinds.
You never can tell what's going on inside their heads.
Where did she go when she left here? Told you, I don't know.
She said she was going out with a man.
Yeah, that was with Alan Bittaker.
And later in the evening, they ran into Nick. It's odd, isn't it?
Bittaker said that she was acting strange and moody last night.
Oh, she was, poor kid.
I had her pegged as a possible murderess.
She was capable of it, too.
This is a great painting of her. It catches her warmth and her passion.
It's too bad you can't see so you could have finished it.
Yes, Stuart, it's too bad you can't see.
Are you sure you didn't go out last night? No, I didn't.
You know, it's a funny thing.
Miss Hayden told me she tried to get you on the phone just after Tanya's call, but there was no answer.
Well, I'll be running along.
Drury... How did you know I hadn't gone out?
It's the nail.
This nail. It's the key to everything.
She knew the secret.
But she can't tell anyone now.
You followed us from that nightclub.
I looked back and saw you come out of that cafe as I pulled away.
And I know a cab followed us to her apartment.
I tell you, I didn't.
Why would I want to kill her?
Because she found out, or guessed something about the murderer of Hayden.
Now, you wouldn't... I didn't. I didn't follow you.
But someone did.
I saw a cab pull out right after you left.
I saw...
Who? Who was it?
I don't know.
When they catch up with you, Nick,
I'd have a pretty clear story to tell.
That's it.
What happened, Trevers?
I don't know, Miss.
Who's there?
Who is it?
Nick! What on earth?
What are you doing here?
It was Dave. I saw him.
Dave?
Why are you holding that cane?
Well, I guess I picked it up during the fight.
I've always suspected Dave and now I'm sure of it!
He can see, Heather,
I know it!
How do you know?
Because I followed him here.
I watched him through that window.
He walked deliberately to that cane-rack and picked up all the canes.
As he started out that door, he must have upset something.
The noise scared him off, and I caught him as he tried to get away.
Shall I call the police,
Miss Heather? No, no.
Just let me think a minute.
If you don't, I will.
He's played on your sympathies long enough!
Who's there?
Alan, Dave.
What is it?
Why did you call me to come here in such a hurry at this hour of the night?
Here, give me your hat and stick.
Did you see anyone outside? No. Who? Why?
I'm in a jam. You've got to help me! Well, what's the matter?
The police think that I killed Tanya.
Yes?
I didn't.
You did.
What?
You're insane. Why, I loved that girl. I know.
But you had to kill the thing you loved because you loved life more.
You're a madman! I've suspected it before, now I know.
Losing your sight has permanently deranged your mind.
No, Alan. I thought so for a while.
I suspected
Tanya had killed Dad Hayden.
But I believed if she did, it was to help me.
Well, I couldn't turn her in, could I? I didn't know what to do.
So what did you do?
I showed her something.
That something led her to discover that you're a murderer.
You killed Dad Hayden!
And what did you show her, Dave?
This. I found it next to Dad Hayden's body.
Tanya noticed that just such a nail as this was missing from the head of your walking stick.
When she called Heather to tell her of her suspicions, you overheard and killed her.
Dad Hayden was killed the same way.
Only two people could have done it, you or Nick.
And Nick doesn't carry a walking stick.
This nail shook loose the night that you beat Dad Hayden to death.
You never missed it, see how well it fits?
Let's see.
It's gonna hang you, Alan.
My dear fellow, what possible reason would I have for killing Hayden?
So that I could have his eyes.
Blindness was the only tie that held Tanya to me.
You wanted me to see again so that you could have her.
Dave, your analysis is right.
Blindness has sharpened your mind.
But not enough to see everything.
Your only mistake was asking me to come here tonight.
You can see!
Too bad you didn't guess that before, Dr. Bittaker.
All right, Captain.
Let's be on our way.
You won, I lost.
Let's just get this unpleasant business over with.
I wouldn't be surprised if this man were insane.
He wouldn't be the first one who'd gone mad studying the processes of the mind.
Precisely, Captain. I compliment you on your sagacity.
You know, it's people like you that have caused me to steer clear of all this book psychology.
Farewell, friend David.
I'll be going this time for good, Stuart.
Oh, there's someone outside here waiting to see you. I'll send her in.
Oh, Dave! Are you all right? Sure, brat.
Please forgive me for doubting you.
Why didn't you tell me the operation was a success?
At first, it wasn't.
Then my sight gradually returned, and I thought, by remaining blind to others, that I might trap the murderer.
I was suspicious of Tanya and watching her.
Oh, that poor girl. It must have been terrible for her.
But from now on, everything's going to be all right.
Sure, brat.
Please don't call me brat.
All right, brat.
And may this be the fate... of all the witches, warlocks, and sorcerers... who attempt to work their evil magic... within the township limits of Roxford.
The book of exorcism, please.
Mayest thou and thy kind... be condemned forever to eternal flames... never to return to the neighborhood of Roxford.
And now, while we prepare for the extinction... of the father of this witch... the old sorcerer who attempted to come to her aid... there will be a short intermission.
- Popped maize.
Get your fresh Indian popped maize, tuppence a poke.
It's buttered, it's hot, it's fresh.
An anti-witch charm in every poke.
Tuppence, please.
Popped maize. Here we are.
It's buttered, it's fresh.
Popped maize,
Master Wooley?
What has got into thee,
Jonathan?
- What?
- Dost doubt she was a witch?
I should never have accused her if I were not sure.
And her father.
Unquestionably a sorcerer.
Mother, if thou hadst seen what I saw.
We both saw our cows turn pink, then blue... and our sheep dancing a minuet.
- But thou didst not see Jennifer.
- Jennifer?
She told me her name when she chased me into the hayloft.
She was young and beautifully fair — fairer than all women that ever were.
How didst not tell that to the judges?
Because I could never describe her beauty.
What happened in the hayloft, Jonathan?
She brought her golden tresses... close to my face and whispered...
"Jonathan Wooley, thou hast denounced me as a witch.
For that thou shalt be accursed.
Thou and thy children and thy children's children — all will be under the same curse."
What was the curse?
I and all my descendants... will be unhappy in love.
The marriages we make will be disastrous until —
Yes?
- 'Tis too wicked to tell thee, Mother.
- Rubbish!
Thou art in love with Purity Sykes and even betrothed to her.
- Aye, Mother.
- And Purity is a woman among thousands.
Aye, Mother, she is that.
Jonathan, wouldst leave thy future wife sit there all alone?
- What ails him, Mistress Wooley?
- Ah, Purity.
You will find he is a dreamer.
He needs only a firm hand.
Jonathan, I must ask thee to be more attentive.
- In the future —
- Look!
The oak tree.
'Twill be planted over their ashes.
- Why?
- To hold the evil spirits — shh! — prisoner in its roots... thus keeping their wicked powers from surviving.
I hope.
And this is the tree which was planted over their ashes.
The witches' spirits, of course... are imprisoned in its roots.
Imprisoned forever.
Martha...
I have the honor to —
- to —
- Are you proposing to me?
Yes, Martha.
Oh, Nathaniel!
What was that?
Fort Sumter fired upon!
War declared between the states!
Nancy — Nancy, control yourself.
Control yourself.
Drop your hand.
I wish to throw this vase!
Master Wooley, did you hear? War!
Where is the nearest recruitin' office?
Running off to war like a coward!
I'm not talking about the whole house at the moment.
It's that living room!
Estelle!
Now — Now, listen to me!
Estelle!
Estelle.
Estelle, please.
- What?
- Miss Masterson?
Please. Hold it.
One more.
Papa, I'm leaving.
Smile.
Will you try to be more pleasant?
At least until after the wedding.
Fellow members of the Roxford Country Club...
Dr. White's proposing another toast.
I realize that lovebirds... would like to be out on the veranda whispering sweet nothings.
After a certain ceremony tomorrow... they will have all the rest of their lives for billing and cooing.
- Mostly billing.
But if the voters have any sense at all, they will insist... that the first four years of the honeymoon be spent in the governor's mansion!
Go ahead. You might pick up a few more votes.
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
I see getting married... as well as trying to get elected, calls for speeches.
I can truly say... that a new life is beginning for me.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's just a storm.
Ladies and gentlemen... while at the moment, the future seems a little dark —
- You see?
One never knows what the next moment will bring.
Where am I? What's happened?
A miracle! An infernal miracle!
We're free again.
Free at last!
-  Who speaketh?
- 'Tis I, thy father, Daniel.
But thou hast no substance.
Nor hast thou, Jennifer.
We are smoke — witches' smoke.
But our evil spirits have survived.
'Twill be sweet to plague the human race again.
First we'll visit the cornfield and ruin the crop.
'Tis always a good way to limber up.
Look, Father.
The cornfield is no longer there.
Well, we must expect a few changes... in 270 years.
Were our spirits in the wood that long?
Aye. I counted the tree rings.
See? They've built a new house.
It seems all ablaze.
Is it on fire?
Not yet!
What's knittin', kitten?
You like to cut a rug?
Let's ditch these ickies. How about goin' to heaven in your jalopy?
That's solid, Jackson.
Now you're cookin' on the front burner.
What language is that,
Father?
I don't know, but we'll learn it.
See how they dance today.
They stand so close.
Well, well, well.
Things have changed.
I never thought I'd see clothes like that in New England.
These cannot be the descendants... of the Puritans we knew.
There's something that hasn't changed... in 270 years.
Keep thy mind on our business!
'Twould be nice to have lips — lips to whisper lies... lips to kiss a man and make him suffer.
Father, why cannot I have lips and eyes and hair?
- Careful. Someone's coming.
Quick! Do as I do!
These bottles — we'll hide in them.
Quick! Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
Whee!
Are you all right, Jennifer?
'Tis full of bubbles in here. They tickle!
My bottle has the tang of maple rum!
Look, Father!
Come closer, man, so I can see thee better.
Riddle-dee-dee, riddle-dee-doe... get thee hence and stub thy toe.
There was something familiar about that face.
Could we follow him?
- What'll it be, Mr. Wooley?
- The same — bourbon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Wooley.
Wooley!
I knew I recognized those features.
Well, well, well.
A descendant of the man who had us burned.
No wonder he looks so unhappy.
I put a curse upon his family.
Well, I thought lovebirds always flew around in pairs.
Estelle's talking politics.
- What's the matter? Election jitters?
- No.
How can I lose, with Masterson and all his papers in back of me?
My future father-in-law has never backed a loser.
If he spoils his record this time,
I'll have to hock my stethoscope.
You're betting on a sure thing, Dudley.
He isn't missing a trick. Look at that.
Posters at a private party.
The whole marriage is just another campaign stunt to him — insisting we hold it the day before the election... so I'll get a good publicity break on election day.
Wallace, I think you've had enough to drink.
- Now, Estelle —
- I'd like to go home.
Yes, dear.
Can we drop you, Dudley?
Yes, thanks.
The curse is working.
She has the look of a shrew!
Here, Tom.
Jennifer, what's that curse thou wast chattering about?
Each Wooley must marry the wrong woman.
Ha! What a curse!
Every man who marries... marries the wrong woman.
True suffering cometh... when a man is in love with the woman he cannot marry.
Father, suppose a man were in love with a witch.
With me.
I would not marry him.
Ha!
Ooh, pardon me.
I need air. d For tonight
I'll merry, merry be d d Tomorrow I'll be sober dd
Let's get out of here.
Let's go for a little ride.
Broom!
Father, give me a body.
Oh, no.
Thou didst get into enough trouble with thy last one.
Thou canst not give me a body.
Thou wouldst not even know how to begin.
No? I'd merely make a little fire.
As thy last body was destroyed by flame... thy new one would be born in flame!
Prove it.
Start that great house on fire.
A hotel for pilgrims.
'Twould be a pleasure burning that.
All right, i will.
Worra, worra, fizzle, dizzle... let the flame begin to sizzle!
P-I-L-G-R-I-M...
H-O-T-E-L!
- Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye, Jennifer.
Be a bad girl.
- That's the Pilgrim Hotel!
- It would have to be on our way home.
- We'll have to stop.
You wouldn't go through fire for your future wife?
Boy, look at those flames.
I never saw such a fire.
- Is there any way we can get through?
- Sorry, Mr. Wooley. It's all blocked off.
- Some firebug must've touched this off.
- He did a good job!
This is the craziest fire
I've ever seen!
Laps up water like a cat!
- You're sure everybody got out?
- Yes, sir. We've checked every room.
Yeah, they're all accounted for.
It's all right, men. Everybody's safe.
Get these people back.
We're stuck here for a while.
Tell them who you are.
They'll have to make way.
- I'm sorry, Estelle.
- Wallace, where are you going?
- There's Mr. Wooley!
- Make way for Wooley.
- Make way for the next governor.
- Would you like to go through?
- Yes, thank you.
Folks, let him get by.
- I'm voting for you.
- There goes a great guy.
- Hello, Mr. Wooley.
- Hello.
Don't get too close.
I got a bet riding on you.
- How did it happen?
- Nobody seems to know.
There was an explosion on the roof.
The top floor went like that.
Then the fifth, then the fourth.
Now it's on the third. Soon it'll be on the second, and then the first... then it'll all cave in on the basement.
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's fully insured... and I love building new things.
I want to build it in a classic gothic design.
- Don't you love gothic? Huh?
- Quiet.
What was that?
Did you hear that voice?
Somebody's inside.
Listen!
I didn't hear anything.
It was so clear!
A woman's voice.
Aw, there's nobody in there.
They've looked everywhere.
No, wait. Wait.
There it is again!
Here i am, Mr. Wooley.
- Over here.
- Where?
I-I can't see!
Just walk.
You'll find me.
Keep walking.
This way. This way.
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
Two legs, two arms, a face, hair.
- Yes, I seem to be complete.
- Why don't you come out? i've been waiting for you,
Mr. Wooley.
- Where are you?
- You're getting warmer.
Here's my hand.
How can I get you out?
I can't see a thing.
I can see you.
How do you do?
Never mind.
Let's get out of here!
- Have you a gazing glass?
- A what?
A mirror.
I want to see what I look like.
- At a time like this?
- Oh, I'm cold.
- Cold? In this furnace?
- But I have no clothes.
No clothes?
Here, put this on.
How did you get here?
From the top floor.
Why do you look away?
Am I not pretty?
Who cares? Come on.
- Get up, get up!
I can't!
Here, I'll carry you.
Legs are funny when you're not used to them, aren't they?
- Huh?
- Why are you in such a hurry?
Why? The whole building was on the third floor, and now it's fallen to the second.
When this ceiling gives way, we'll be buried alive.
Nothing will happen to us.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, I do.
Ah! Here's a door!
Here!
- Oh!
- Oh!
This way's blocked.
The bars on the window.
Quick —
- Where are you?
- I've found a better coat.
And a mirror!
Mm, not bad.
Oh, I'm a blond.
Would you rather
I be a brunette?
If you don't get out of this fire, you'll be a redhead!
Don't you realize —
That was the second floor.
Well, there's no way out.
We're goners, little girl.
Perhaps I should be little.
I'm just as high as your heart.
Did you hear what I said?
We're trapped.
Just we two.
Look, before I got here... what — what hit you on the head?
I felt nothing until your hand touched mine.
Oh, I see.
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, would you like to leave now?
It would be a pleasure... but that door is now a wall.
Oh. Then we can use the one behind the screen.
- Quick! It's our only chance!
- I want to fix my hair.
Come on, while you still have a head!
Do you like blonds?
May I get a picture?
Hold it right there.
He saved somebody!
Stand back, people.
- Are you all right?
- I guess so.
- You certainly gave me a scare.
- Wally...
- take me away from these people.
- Here, Dudley.
She's suffering from shock.
Well, uh guess I'd better take you to a hospital.
Oh, well,
I hope she's all right.
It's only natural for you to be concerned.
Estelle, I've told you a dozen times.
There's no point in — Well?
It's amazing.
Not a scratch on her. Not a burn.
- You must be relieved.
- You've known me all my life.
She never met Wally.
The girl's suffering from delusions.
You see?
She has delusions.
- Well, I haven't!
- Estelle, you must believe me!
- Listen to me.
- I've never seen her before... and I —
I'll never see her again!
- Dear, you ought —
- It's silly to drive me home and then back here.
- You need rest.
- Darling —
I know best. You have to get used to pleasing me sometimes.
- All right, dear.
- Ooh, you still smell of smoke.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
Susie, you know you can't come in until breakfast time.
- Scat!
Scat!
Susie! Susie!
Susie?
Susie, where are you?
Hello, darling.
- I thought you'd never get rid of that girl.
- What are you doing here?
Waiting for you.
- But the hospital, the —
- I didn't like it there.
How did you get here?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
What am I to do with you?
Just look on me as an old friend of the family.
- I never laid eyes on you before.
- Come here, Wally.
Am I not an attractive female?
- What's that got to do with your being here?
- Am I?
Yes, yes, you're very pretty.
- Take my hand again.
- Now, come. I know you've had a terrible experience.
And now a pleasant one.
You... have a very nice hand.
And now it can shake mine good night.
- Your hand is cold.
- Well, so is yours.
Yes, good-good night.
Let mine rest in yours a moment.
See?
It's growing warmer.
Well, that's fine.
That's fi—
- Amusing-looking chap, isn't he?
- Yes.
- Ancestor of mine.
- I'm aware he is.
Jonathan Wooley.
He would have been more hospitable.
Oh, I don't think so.
Well, I have a busy day tomorrow.
It's time for beddy-bye.
- Mm, take my hand again.
- You're becoming a problem.
- Am I?
- Yes, and that is not the solution.
See, it isn't respectable for you to be sitting in a stranger's house.
- I like your resisting me.
- Oh, you do?
- You know what I'm going to do with you now?
- Yes.
Just, uh, get up, please.
- Where are you taking me, Wally?
- We're going out.
Night, Jonathan!
I'm going to give you money, and you can go back wherever you came from.
- No, not yet.
- Yes, right now!
Ooh, this is a lovely sensation.
Even nicer than flying.
- What's going on, Governor?
- Not "Governor" yet, Fred.
She was in a fire and lost her clothes.
No, I didn't.
I didn't have any.
- Evening, Mr. Wooley.
- Have you any money, Joe?
About eight bucks.
Well, I only have ten, but here.
Give it all to her and take her anyplace she wants to go.
I'll pay you tomorrow.
For heaven's sake, be good.
What'll I do with the coat?
When you're through with it, send it to the police.
It-It didn't belong to her.
[ Nervous Chuckle ]
I hope that cab is heated.
Where to, lady?
Where to?
Oh.
Hope I didn't butt in on a pleasant dream.
Just wanted to make sure you're all right.
- You've certainly earned a drink.
- I'll say I have.
Upstairs you go. Get a good night's sleep. I'll take this.
- Dudley, she was here!
- Who was here?
The girl
I saved in the fire.
That's impossible.
When I left her in the hospital, she was sleeping like an angel.
Well, that's some hospital.
She got away. And some angel.
Now, wait a minute, hmm?
Tell me this again slowly.
No, tomorrow.
I've had enough for one day.
How about me?
I've got $1 0,000 tied up in this election.
If this gets out, you're a dead goose.
Think of the scandal — the night before your wedding.
That's it — the election!
That girl was sent here by the opposition.
- They're trying to frame me.
- You're right.
Rainfogle and that bunch wouldn't stop at anything. Did anybody see her?
- Nobody who'll do any talking.
- Good. I'll put her down as an amnesia case.
Give the police a description.
Was she wearing that fur coat?
Maybe you'd better not say anything to the police.
Everything's all right now.
I got rid of her.
Well, try and forget her, then.
You want a pill to make you sleep?
No. No, thanks.
I'm much calmer now.
Oh, make sure the door locks.
Okay. Relax, now.
- Good night, Wally.
Now close this door, Wally.
I said close this door, Wally.
Now come here.
I'm coming.
My pajamas.
I don't want to call the police, but I know your whole scheme.
- You do?
- And I know who's behind it all.
- You don't.
- Want me to mention names?
- What names?
- County Chairman
Martin J. Rainfogle.
- That's a nice name.
- Want another?
- Mm-hmm.
- State Senator Conrad O'Hara Jr.
Sheriff Peter L. Glasshauser and all his ward heelers.
- How much are they paying you?
- Nothing.
Ha! Hmm?
You're just doing it for love, hmm?
Yes. Father thought it'd be a good idea.
- Who is your father?
- You've never met him.
But he doesn't want this state to have a good administration.
Father doesn't want any state to have a good administration.
- But he's out to get me particularly.
- Yes.
I am a pretty good judge of character... and I don't think you're really a bad girl.
- Don't you?
- You're very young.
I'm older than you'd guess.
I don't think you ought to go back to that father.
I'd rather stay with you.
You would?
You really would, wouldn't you?
Now I understand.
Just because I was of some slight help... in getting you out of that blazing inferno... perhaps you are, momentarily, infatuated with me.
But it isn't love.
And I'm not in love with you.
I guess this'll take longer than I planned.
I'm afraid you have rather a romantic mind.
You see, love isn't just a matter of... two people meeting under romantic circumstances.
Love — that is, love that is really worthwhile — grows slowly.
Real love is... like a painting.
Ah, yes.
Yes, there have been thousands and thousands... of couples just like us... going their separate ways... never realizing the other was waiting somewhere.
Why, Romeo and Juliet knew right away.
That's what Shakespeare's trying to tell us.
Of course, the case of Dante and Beatrice... is a trifle different.
He saw her only once.
But in that moment, the whole world... was bathed in a new light.
It wasn't just a humdrum world anymore, where you had to... get up in the morning and meet a lot of stupid people.
- Who's that?
-  8:00, Mr. Wooley.
- What?
- That's impossible.
But... it's true!
- Good morning, Wally.
- Good morning, Jennifer.
It's fantastic.
It just seems like a few minutes since I came in.
Don't you want your breakfast?
You're as bad as when you were a little boy.
Even on a day like this, I have to call you half a dozen times.
Oh, and what a — what a beautiful day it is too.
Happy is the bride that the sun... shines on.
Good morning.
Mmm!
That smells good!
You don't know how long it's been since I've eaten.
- Mr. Wooley —
- I'll explain later, Margaret.
- What can you possibly say?
- Well, you —
No, no, dear.
Not like that.
First you butter them, hmm?
And then a little syrup.
Mr. Wooley, I've worked for your family for 30 years... been almost a mother to you... and to think that on this day, of all days —
Oh, yes, and send up some evening gowns too, please.
You see, everything the young lady had was burned.
Send them up right away, please.
Thank you.
You know, I think you've broken my record for waffles.
Well, Margaret likes nothing better than to make them.
Those people are still downstairs waiting.
Margaret, these have made a great hit with her.
- What did you say?
- Those people.
I told you they were here three batches of waffles ago.
You did?
I don't remember.
Uh, people waiting?
Who? Who are they?
- You'll find out.
- Excuse me.
Mm, more waffles?
There's no more batter.
Oh! I'm sorry, Margaret.
- Better be sorry for yourself.
- Huh?
It's Miss Masterson downstairs, with her father.
Who?
Miss Masterson, the lady you're getting married to.
Oh!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I'd forgotten you were going to drop in.
We didn't say we were.
What's the matter with you?
Have you seen the papers?
I've got you all over the front page.
That's great.
Dear, hadn't you better go?
- It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
- Don't be ridiculous.
Saving that girl was the luckiest break.
You don't know what that can do for you.
I have a rough idea.
I've arranged a special broadcast about the fire. You're to be interviewed.
- I'll have you back by 1 1 :00.
- That's fine.
That gives me plenty of time.
Shall we go?
No, I'm going to stay here.
I want to see about brightening up this antique shop.
- The photographers will be here.
- There's no time.
- Run along.
- I'm a little on edge, with the wedding at noon.
I'd feel much better if you came along.
There.
That's a good girl.
Excuse me.
I'll get my hat.
[ Estelle Shrieks ]
- How did that happen?
- it just slammed shut.
I'm terribly sorry.
There's rather a heavy draft... blowing through the house today.
What's he going out with her for?
Why shouldn't he?
He's going to marry her in less than two hours.
- As for you, young woman —
- Oh, go to sleep.
After all my work!
No, I don't want to go.
Two hours.
That doesn't give me much time.
I wish Father were here.
What seems to be the trouble?
Oh, good morning, Father.
I need some advice.
He's tougher than I thought.
I can't seem to make him love me.
Thou art the veriest bungler.
I must have been drunk to give thee a body.
Oh, don't smoke so much, Father.
- Did something go wrong with thy philter?
- My what?
Thy love philter.
Thou gavest him one, I presume.
No. I thought I could do it barehanded.
Art thou a witch or a woman?
Prepare a love philter at once.
Dost thou recall the incantation? Listen. dd [ Simple Melody ] d Kettle, kettle on the hob d d Hurry up and do thy job d
[ Daniel ] d Steam and hiss and while you do d d Cook an all-compelling brew d d So that he who sips will be d d Slave to love's captivity dd
Now put in a cool place until ready.
- What will it taste like, Father?
- Like cool water... but 'twill set
Master Wooley's blood on fire.
Then I'll treat him like a slave.
I'll make him suffer, body and soul.
Speaking of bodies,
I have a notion to make a personal appearance myself.
Of course, I'll have to burn a house down to do it.
Not this one, Father.
I've a better idea: the building he's in now.
- 'Twill force him back to me.
- Excellent!
Good hunting, Jennifer.
'Tis growing cool.
Now we shall see if thou canst resist me.
Get ready, Master Wooley.
- Not dressed yet?
- I'm lucky to be alive.
What's happened now?
I was making a broadcast about the fire, and suddenly
I was in another one.
- Mysterious explosion on the roof.
- Anybody hurt?
No, we all got out all right.
What's wrong with this door?
Margaret!
What are you two doing in my bedroom?
What happened?
Oh, I —
I must have dozed off.
Go upstairs and get dressed.
Where's the brandy?
- Did you get rid of that girl?
- "That girl"?
Oh! She must still be here.
Well, she won't be here for long.
Ah, you listen to me, young lady.
Come on, come on.
Get up.
I'm listening, Mr. Wooley.
Why do you look at me that way?
Oh... my dress.
Do you like it?
I — I don't know.
It's such a shock to see you dressed.
I mean...
- you're beautiful.
- Enough to make a man fall in love?
Mere physical beauty isn't everything.
That's what I thought.
-  Look, Jennifer —
- I don't like the tone of your voice.
I swallowed some smoke last night, and I just swallowed more now.
- But that's not going to stop me —
- Wally wants a drink of water.
Nice, cool water.
Thank you.
Now, all I have to say —
Drink it, Wally... and then I'll be glad to hear anything you have to say.
You'll find out that no one named Wooley... is able to stay away from me.
Oh, i'm awfully sorry.
This is terrible.
Jennifer! Jennifer!
Can you hear me?
Dudley! Come here!
Oh, you —
Here, here. Drink this.
There.
There, that's better.
Now, how do you feel?
I — I feel strange.
- Hmm?
- What happened?
Well, the picture fell.
Does your head hurt?
- My head?
- Mm.
No.
It's my heart.
- It feels so light.
- Try not to talk.
Oh, but I must.
I must tell you how I feel.
Oh, Wally, you're so beautiful.
Dudley!
- Take my hand.
- Don't start that again.
Oh, my darling.
Let that man alone!
Dudley, something really happened to her this time.
- She got a sock on the head.
That picture —
- You did it in self-defense.
Aren't you glad you drank it, Wally?
- I didn't drink anything.
- What's she talking about?
A drink of water. I gave it to her when she was coming to.
You gave it to me?
Never force liquids on a person who's unconscious.
It may have serious consequences.
- Nervous reactions.
- Come on. We're late.
- What are we going to do?
- Lock her in this room.
- But, Dudley —
Come on, before she marries you.
Stop worrying.
She can't get out.
I'll drive.
You're too nervous.
You'll have to get rid of her after the wedding.
Poor little girl.
All alone in the world... except for a no-good father.
Don't ever jam your brakes on like that!
I didn't jam them.
It just stopped.
- I can't figure it out.
- What's that smoke?
- What happened to him?
- Who?
The fellow we pulled out of the fire. He's gone!
How do you like my body, Jennifer?
Not too old, not too young.
I'm sorry I've forgotten the formula for clothing.
I had to borrow this sheet from the ambulance.
By the by, has the potion been administered?
Yes.
Father, something went wrong with our plan.
What?
But that love philter never fails.
It didn't.
But... I drank it.
Nicodemus!
Then you love him!
Yes, Father.
But he's about to marry someone else... because of my ancient curse on the Wooleys.
Do you think if I explained it all to him —
By all means do.
Telling a mortal you're a witch will only mean the end of you.
Then what shall I do?
He must not marry her.
You won't let him, will you?
- Let me think.
- You could make him love me.
You can do anything you want.
Yes.
This problem should be fairly simple.
- Just leave it all to me.
- Oh, thank you, Father!
- Will you leave it to me?
- i promise.
Splendid.
[ Chuckles ] I'm still a little bit warm from the fire.
Jennifer, fetch me a pair of Master Wooley's breeches.
We're going to his wedding. d I love you truly d d Truly d d Dear d d Life with its sorrows d d Life with d d Its tears dd
Here, drink this.
- What is it?
- Novocain. 1 20 proof.
- Down fast, brother.
- If that girl ever gets out of my house —
Drink that.
Suppose she comes here?
It'll be terrible for Estelle.
Oh, you'll be all right, and I'll be sitting pretty.
- dd [ Instrumental Interlude ]
- There's your cue.
Just play
"I'm a seeing-eye dog" now.
- Can't you smile?
- You know I wanted a church wedding.
You've had everything else your own way.
I should never have given in to Wallace. It's the last time.
She's not here.
Stop worrying. dd [ "Bridal March" ]
Smile.
- [ Wind Gusting ]
- [ Women Screaming ]
[ All Clamoring ]
Close that door!
It's a hurricane!
- My veil is ruined!
- Go back and wait.
I'm terribly sorry.
There'll be a short delay till we get everything straightened out.
Music, music!
Sing something. d I love you truly d
That's all I needed: a hurricane on my wedding day.
Never mind about that.
She just blew in!
- What?
- I saw her in the doorway.
- What'll I do?
- I'll think of something.
Beloved, this is my father.
Delighted, Master Wooley.
You've made a mistake.
This is a private room.
It's rather crowded downstairs, and a bit windy. [ Chuckles ]
Be seated, Master Wooley.
I should like to have a talk with you.
Look here. I'm being married in two minutes.
- I understand those were your plans.
- "Were?" He is. Nothing you can do —
- Would you excuse us?
- Maybe you'd better.
Hurry up.
I'll stand guard.
Let me fix your pretty tie.
You see, Father?
He's just like a Greek god.
My little one tells me she was your overnight guest.
- Not at my invitation.
- Oh, no, Father.
The poor sweet didn't want me to stay.
Were I an ordinary man,
Master Wooley... a horsewhipping would no doubt be in order.
But I am not an ordinary man.
While examining your dwelling...
- I came upon... this.
- My revolver!
You can't force me to marry her.
What a banal mind you have.
You may hold the weapon.
- What is this?
- It's very simple.
Here is a bruised flower.
I am her father.
That is your revolver.
You are going to shoot me.
I... am going to shoot you?
Will that be of help?
Now, now.
Father knows best.
Warm, Master Wooley?
You don't know what warmth is.
I am told one of your forebears made a hobby of bonfires.
What a pity he cannot be here... to see his descendant burn.
Yes, Master Wooley.
Burn.
In the modern way.
Strapped in a chair... heated by electricity.
I anticipated that.
Pistol, pistol, let there be... murder in the first degree.
Thank you so much.
Amusing invention, the electric chair.
[ Chuckles ]
What will they think of... next?
- What's happened?
- Uh —
- It was an accident!
- 'Twas no accident.
He killed me in cold blood.
Kindly notify the authorities.
Oh, he's frightened you.
He told me he'd help me.
- [ Wallace ] How is he?
- He's dead.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
"Doesn't matter"?
Her own father!
Oh, but that's not my father.
That's just a body he picked up.
I didn't do it, Dudley!
You'll be my witness!
All right.
Well, I wasn't here!
[ Groaning ] dd [ Instrumental Interlude ]
He's as nervous as a bride.
One might think they were going to hang him.
It's up to you.
Now, tell them.
What have I got to do with it?
You're handling the... details of the wedding. dd [ "Bridal March" ]
[ Gasping, Clamoring ] d I love you truly d d Truly d
Empty! I thought
I saw smoke come out.
I know you're here somewhere.
How could you, Father?
You know I love him!
[ Daniel ] That's exactly why i've disposed of him.

Well, you're not going to.
- [ Woman Shrieks ]
- [ Wallace Gasps ]
Wally!
Don't go upstairs!
- But maybe she killed herself.
- Now, Wally — Wally —
- What's wrong with him?
- I think we'd better call the police.
- What's he done?
- It's the other fellow.
- What other fellow?
- The one in the chair.
Keep calm. I'll be right back.
- [ Exclaims ]
- Estelle! Estelle! d Ah, love, 'tis something d d To feel d
Now, you get back in that body.
No. I didn't like it.
It's an old, fat body.
Then I'll tell Wally what we are.
Knowing what would then happen to you?
- Yes.
- Heh. You wouldn't dare.
Wouldn't I?
You're all right?
[ Jennifer ] Wally, darling, there's something i must tell you.
[ Gasps ]
Look!
- I thought you said he was dead!
- Well, he is!
[ Drunkenly ]
A fine way to take advantage... of a father's affection.
Now hearken to a father's curse.
I'm going to turn you into a frog.
Frog, frog, sitting on a log —
What's the next line?
You wait till I sober up.
You'll be sorry.
[ Woman Gasps ] d For tonight
I'll merry, merry be d d Tomorrow I'll be sober dd
- What did you want the police for?
- It's all right now.
He fell out the window.
- He what?
- Not Wally. The other fellow.
- Unhand me, foul minions of the law!
- Take it easy, Pop.
I'm going to cast a spell upon you.
From now on, you're a rat!
Rat, rat, fatter than the cat —
- How does the rest of it go?
- So I'm a rat, huh?
- Call the wagon.
- Come on.
If I could only remember the words...
I could turn you into kangaroos.
They're taking him away.
Why didn't I have them take you too?
Perhaps because you're beginning to love me.
- Please don't start that again.
- Wally!
I thought Father would be friendly.
I wouldn't let him or anyone else harm you.
- Oh, I know you wouldn't.
- But it's true!
Last night I was your enemy, but now I've changed.
I love you.
I'll always love you.
- If I could die,
I would do that for you.
- Will you just be a sweet girl?
- Hey, they're ready.
- Good-bye.
- Where are you going?
- I told you before —
But I thought that now, after all I've done for you —
You've been very obliging, but now
I'm going downstairs to be married.
That's what you think. dd [ Instrumental Interlude ]
[ Jennifer Screams ]
Wally!
You gotta go through with it this time.
I'll take care of her. dd [ "Bridal March" ]
Hurry up, hurry up.
Let's get this over with.
He'll pay for this.
- Do I look all right?
- Who cares? Go on.
Well, what are you standing there for?
Dudley has the ring.
I'll see what's keeping him.
- Wallace.
- You come back here!
What's the matter with you?
Did you ever have one of those days when nothing seems to go right?
Wallace! d i love you truly d
- Got here too late.
- Dudley.
She really did love me.
She said she'd die for me.
- Oh, my darling.
- At last!
[ Surprised Gasp ]
I've had enough of this!
Estelle, wait a minute!
Listen to me!
You've got to listen to me!
Uh — [ Nervous Chuckle ]
It's a big misunderstanding.
If you'll give me a few minutes, I —
I'll give you just ten seconds to get out of this house, all of you!
We won't be here that long.
- You'd better get out of the state.
- I'm terribly —
- Get out!
- I can explain.
Uh, after the fire, you see, she spent the ni-night —
On-On second thought...
- maybe we'd better just go, darling.
- Mr. Masterson —
I'll expose you in every paper I own!
This'll not only cost you the election, but I'll encourage the voters of this state to tear you limb from limb!
I'll head the tar-and-feather party personally!
When I'm through with you, you'll wish you'd never been born. d I love you truly d
- Will you shut up?
- d Tru- dd
[ Man ] Extra! Big Wooley scandal!
Read all about it!
Extra! Paper!
Big Wooley scandal!
Extra! Read all about it!
Wallace Wooley exposed!
Extra! Paper!
- Big Wooley scandal!
- What does it say?
It's just as I thought.
He's finished.
And I'm bankrupt.
Go and get her, I say.
Bring my daughter to me.
Bring her here or, by Jezebel —
- Shut up!
- Quiet!
- I wanna get some sleep!
- Hey, toss this stub bug out of here!
For the last time, will you pipe down?
I tell you, my daughter ran off with a bumpkin... named Wooley,
Wallace Wooley.
Sure, she did. You take it easy.
You'll be out of here tomorrow.
Tomorrow may be too late!
There's no telling what she'll do.
I know a couple of ways to make you shut up.
And I know a hundred ways... to silence you forever.
Oh, but I don't remember them now.
This is terrible!
She'll marry him.
Wallace Wooley's gonna marry his daughter.
Yeah?
And then you'll see what'll happen to Master Wooley.
I'll wreak my vengeance on them both.
She thinks she can run away from me... that I cannot see her because of the fog.
But I can see you, Jennifer.
She smiles.
She presses closer to him.
Darling?
Yes, Wally?
You're guessing about those mileposts, aren't you?
No, I can see them.
I have rather unusual eyes.
If we're really over the state line,
I can relax.
Wally, what color would those feathers be?
"Feathers"?
Oh, I don't know.
But the tar would be black.
Let's stop, Wally.
I guess we'll have to.
I can't even see the front of the car.
Mighty nice scenery they have around here.
- Lovely, isn't it?
- We'd better walk to the next town.
No, I thought we'd stay here.
Here? We're in the middle of nowhere.
How do you know,
Mr. Wooley?
Good evening.
If you're looking for a place to stay,
I have a lovely room.
Thank you.
- Do you have two rooms?
- No, i'm sorry.
Aren't you married?
You're dressed for a wedding.
Where's the nearest justice of the peace?
He'll be down in a minute.
Henry? Customers.
Uh, let's see.
One dollar for waking up the county clerk... and helping you get your license.
Two dollars for the ceremony.
One-fifty for lodgings.
Rent of my pajamas,
25 cents.
Rent of nightgown —
I'll have to charge you
50 cents for that.
- It's sort of an heirloom.
- Yeah.
There.
Almost a perfect fit.
My grandmother was just a little bit of a thing like you.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, shall I light the fire?
Oh, no.
I'd like to try.
I must start learning to be a good housewife.
Let's see. You... just go like that, don't you?
Of course.
They're like any other matches.
Well, good night, my dear.
I'm sure you're going to be very happy.
He's a fine young man... and I hope your boys take after him.
And I hope your girls take after you.
- By Rhadamanthus, on, fire!
- [ Door Opens ]
[ Gasps ]
- Wally?
- Yes, dear?
- Did you see the way that fire came on?
- What fire?
All I can see in this room is you.
- Darling?
- Mm-hmm?
- Do you want to have children?
- Why, of course.
I'd like three little girls exactly like you.
- Ohh!
- Huh?
I think I'd better tell you.
You'd never forgive me if you found out later.
- Aha! A confession!
- Yes, Wally.
I haven't exactly been a saint myself.
We'll compare notes in the morning.
No, I must tell you now.
I don't know how to begin.
Then don't.
- Wally?
- Hmm?
Doesn't it seem strange to you, the way we met?
It's all been like a dream.
- It was witchcraft.
- That's it. Of course.
- You see, Wally —
- Shh, dear.
It's getting late.
But I want you to know what I am.
All right.
All right, what are you?
I'm a witch.
A witch? [ Chuckles ]
I knew it all the time.
- You did?
- Of course.
I've been under your spell since the moment I met you.
Then... it doesn't matter?
You don't mind being married to a witch?
I love it.
I'll try so hard to be a good wife, and I'll only use witchcraft to help you.
What could you do, for instance?
I could make you win the election tomorrow.
Oh, it would take witchcraft to do that.
- I think I can manage it.
- Fine, fine.
After all, I'm not just an ordinary witch.
My family dates back to the days of Pompeii.
- Were you mixed up in that?
- My father was.
Ever hear of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire?
That was our crowd.
You're marvelous.
Seriously, dear... do you like to sleep on the left or the right?
You don't believe me.
Wally, try to understand.
270 years ago —
That's too long a story, dear.
Can't it keep till tomorrow?
Wally, 270 years ago —
- You're not listening to me.
- Yes, dear. Yes, I am.
270 years ago —
I'll tell you tomorrow.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Oh, why can't I remember... the formula for dissolving iron?
- Let me out!
- Quiet!
- Pipe down!
- I couldn't get any shut-eye all night.
- Ah, throw him into solitary!
- Yeah.
That's Wallace Wooley.
Don't tell me they're tossing him in the clink.
It looks that way.
Pay up, brother.
They ain't electing no con for governor.
Bensinger's a cinch.
Why couldn't you keep straight until after you was elected, like everybody else does?
I'd like to talk to you about Jennifer.
We were married last night.
Yes, I know.
Congratulations,
Master Wooley.
Thank you. She's been saying the oddest things... last night and again this morning.
What?
Silly things... about living in Roxford
270 years ago, and, uh — and being a witch.
Beelzebub!
Don't you think I know?
Oh, then she's acted that way before?
Well, maybe
I can help her.
Silence!
I must concentrate.
Iron, iron, melt away —
Oh!
I can't remember a thing.
What is the matter with me?
I'm afraid you've got a hangover.
Don't tell me what I've got!
I invented the hangover!
It was in 1 892 BC.
Did you believe her?
That's the important thing.
"Believe her"? Why, the things she said didn't make any sense.
Then there's still hope.
At first I thought she was joking, but she keeps talking about the election... saying she'll make me win by witchcraft... and that that'll prove she's a witch.
Master Wooley, see if you can get me out of here.
I know how to handle her.
Thanks.
I'll do my best... but I'm afraid I haven't much influence in this town anymore.
- It'll be a Bensinger landslide!
- Quiet!
Three cheers for Wallace Wooley! Hurray!

- I changed my mind.
- Yeah, but you're bettin' on Bensinger.
All right, so I'll lose.
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
Quiet! Quiet!
We want Wooley!
Wallace Wooley is a fraud!
An impostor!
A hypocritical demagogue!
That's why I'm asking you to vote for...
Wallace Wooley.
- Mr. Masterson —
- One moment, please. Yes?
You said,
"Vote for Wooley."
Did I?
Correction, ladies and gentlemen.
The man I am backing is Bensinger.
W-O-O-L-E-Y!
We want Wooley! We want Wooley!

We want Wooley!
[ Man On Radio ]
That includes every precinct in Kearsarge County, folks.
It looks as if the whole state's gonna make it a Wooley landslide.
More in a minute.
- I can't believe it.
- That's just what she'd said she'd do.
- There's no other explanation.
- You mean she's a —
You see why I couldn't go down to campaign headquarters tonight?
- If this gets out —
- Let's look at these
Wappasocket figures.
- They're not complete.
- You can't be carrying Wappasocket
County. That's Bensinger's home.
Another bulletin, folks:
Complete returns from Wappasocket... show the entire county has climbed on the Wooley bandwagon.
- Well? Are you convinced?
- He must mean another county.
Hold everything.
Here's a flash, folks.
At 1 0:45 tonight, with only three precincts yet to be heard from... election returns were as follows:
Wallace Wooley — 2,684,922.
Elwood Bensinger — none.
He didn't even vote for himself.
Dudley, I've married a witch.
What am I going to do?
Let me look at you.
Did you say she's 800,000 years old?
No, no, no, no, no.
That's her father. She's only 290.
- I see.
- But you'd never think it.
Well, marriage does a lot for people.
Well, Wally, this clears everything up.
All except one little point:
How did she get out of the hospital that night?
- She used a broom.
- Oh, of course!
I must be getting stupid.
A child would know that.
Dudley, what — what am I going to do?
- How many people have you told?
- No one but you. How can I?
I see your point.
People are so skeptical.
Might be hard to grasp that the first lady is a witch.
- I don't care about them.
What about me?
- Look out!
Are you satisfied, darling?
You're the new governor.
- What are you going to do now?
- Help you with your slippers.
- No, not just yet.
- Then I'll warm them by the fire.
You know, I lighted it with a match, Wally.
From now on, I'm going to be just a simple, helpful wife.
Dudley, I can't take it.
"A helpful wife."
What if she runs me for president?
- What's that?
People gathering in the street.
They want you to make a speech.
- Real people?
- Naturally. They all voted for Wally.
- What am I gonna say to them?
- I don't know.
There are one or two things
I wouldn't tell them. Good night.
- Where are you going?
- I've gotta be getting home — into my straightjacket!
- Would you like me to drive you?
- No, thanks. I'll call a broom —
I mean, a taxi.
- Wally, darling.
- Yes, dear?
You don't mind my being a witch, do you?
Well, you'll admit it's a little unusual.
- No one need ever know.
- We'll talk about that later, dear.
It'll be our little secret.
Our little secret?
Now go out and make your speech to them, dear.
Good evening, my dear.
- Three cheers for Wallace Wooley!
Hurray!
I must compliment you on the public confidence... you have inspired for Master Wooley.
- You're not going to hurt him again?
- I will attend to him later.
I am concerned now with an erring daughter.
I've done nothing except love him.
You have informed him that you are a witch.
Need I remind you of the punishment... that I must perforce administer?
At midnight, back to the tree!
There to stay until the present race of men is extinguished.
A rather light sentence, considering the offense.
But if I don't wish to go —
- There is nothing you can do about it.
- I'm still a witch.
No, my dear. Your heart is so full of human love... that I can no longer trust you.
Until you have resumed a more spirit-like existence... you shall be a mere mortal!
I've remembered all the spells you've taught me.
Out, fire, by Rhadamanthus!
- Out!
You see?
Your power is dead.
Mine remains.
Out, fire.
Better get ready.
Soonest done, soonest mended... and midnight approaches.
May I... say good-bye?
Certainly, my dear.
I'll be around.
...endeavor to give this fair state an honest administration.
As a former governor so aptly put it —
Wally! Wally!
Uh, and in conclusion, thank you very much.
What is it?
- You must help me!
- You want me to help you?
- Come on, darling. Hurry!
- No, no. But where?
- Anywhere.
Out the back door. Hurry up.
Anyplace, Joe.
Just drive around.
Hey!
That's my cab!
- What is all this?
- I had to get you away.
Something might have happened to you.
- What?
- I don't know, but something awful.
- Can't you tell me about it now?
- Wally, I'm afraid!
You are afraid.
What trouble can you be in that you can't get out of by witchcraft?
- I've lost my power.
- What?
I'm not a witch any longer.
I'm like any other girl.
I wish we could go so fast that no power on earth could overtake us!
- Faster!
- Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around.
You are like any other girl — afraid of lightning.
That isn't ordinary lightning.
- Can't he go any faster?
- Step on it, Joe.
Faster.
Nobody could possibly catch us.
Joe's a wonderful driver.
There's nothing he can't do with the car.
They've certainly improved this road.
Is it midnight yet?
No.
Five minutes to 1 2:00.
Don't look!
[ Daniel ]
Back to the tree!
[ Daniel Cackling ]
Don't worry about me,
Master Wooley.
I am accustomed to fire.
Come, Jennifer.
I have decided to return with thee to the tree.
I am weary of mortals.
There's no use fighting.
It has to be like this.
- Jennifer, what are you saying?
- Go, Wally. Please.
Midnight.
Good-bye, my darling.
I want you to remember me as I was: just an ordinary girl.
-  He'll remember.
That will be his torture.
And I'll remember that I loved you.
Through all eternity
I'll remember.
[ Cackles ]
Thou wilt remember nothing of this tender feeling.
That will be the essence of thy punishment.
I'll never forget.
With all my strength
I'll fight.
Love is stronger than witchcraft.
I'll remember everything — the sound of your voice... your worried looks... the warmth of your arms around me... the touch of your lips.
Good-bye, Wally.
Good-bye, my darling.
I'll remember. i'll always remember.
Always.
Always. Always.
Look at him.
Is it not good to see him suffer?
Yes, Father.
Is this not a perfect revenge on the Wooleys?
Yes, Father.
Could we follow him?
And why?
To watch him suffer, of course.
Well said, Jennifer!
Thou art a witch again!
She's dead, Master Wooley.
Thy marriage is a mournful memory.
Let's be gone, Jennifer.
Let me tarry but a moment at this window.
I wish to see it all.
Thou art enjoying it, eh?
Oh, yes. And thou?
I cannot remember when I've had a better time.
[ Cackles ]
It's great in here.
I've called a doctor,
Mr. Wooley.
Jennifer?
The sound of his voice — it no longer thrills thee?
- No, Father.
- Good.
And his worried looks?
And the warmth of his arms around thee?
These are things that have no meaning for me now.
And the touch of his lips?
Wally... love is stronger than witchcraft. d For tonight I'll merry, merry be d d For tonight
I'll merry, merry be d
- d Tomorrow I'll be sober dd
- Oh, no, you won't.
Wally, darling, all our troubles are over.
At least for the present.
Mr. Wooley...
I've been with your family for 37 years, but this is the end.
- What is it, Margaret?
- I simply cannot handle your daughter!
Jennifer!
I told you never to play with that broom.
Why?
I'm afraid we're going to have trouble with her someday.
Oh, that's impossible.
I hope. d Good night, ladies d d We're going to leave you now dd
Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
Oh, lady!
That's how guys lose their jobs, not collecting fares.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little excited.
Thank you, lady.
Good evening.
Good evening. I'm Mrs. Stewart.
Would you give me my husband's room number, please.
Lieutenant Stewart.
Lieutenant Stewart.
Yes, he's arriving today.
I wired for the reservation.
Lieutenant and Mrs. Paul Stewart.
You say you wired for a reservation?
Yes, Mrs. Paul Stewart.
I'm afraid there's been a slip up.
Apparently your wire wasn't received.
But I sent it three days ago.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Stewart.
Unfortunately there's nothing I can do for you.
You mean I can't stay here?
I wish I could help, but we're completely booked up.
But I've got to stay here.
This is the only place we can find each other.
I thought for two years he was dead and now I don't know if he's been hurt or what.
Please don't be upset, Mrs. Stewart.
Perhaps I can arrange something.
Has Mr. Walters checked in yet?
No, sir. Not until tomorrow.
Fine, then we can get them 816c for tonight.
But you'll have to leave by noon tomorrow.
Yes, of course. Thank you very much.
Not at all.
Would you register, please?
Janet!
Janet!
Janet, it's me.
Let me in, Janet.
Janet, I'm home.
Paul!
Paul! Paul, darling!
Paul, don't go away!
Paul!
Paul, wait!
Paul, wait!
I can't open the door!
Help me!
Janet, I can't find you!
Where are you, Janet?
Janet!
Janet!
Paul?
Paul!
Hello, this is Mrs. Stewart.
Did my husband come in?
No, thank you.
You followed me, Margaret.
You've been spying on me.
I have. I've been watching you for months making a fool of yourself.
I don't think so.
Bringing her here.
Elaine was just about to leave.
I didn't interrupt too soon?
Perhaps it's just as well things worked out like this, Margaret.
I've...
I've decided to ask you for a divorce.
A divorce?
Well?
Why should I divorce you?
Oh, please, Margaret, let's be sensible.
Whatever we had for one another is gone.
We've been afraid to admit it before, but it's true.
Elaine and I...
Well, I love her.
You never loved anyone but yourself.
Please, Margaret.
I was good enough for you once, but now you want someone younger.
It's not that way at all.
It's just that I...
I can't go on with you any longer.
All right, Richard.
You can have your divorce.
You're right, we are strangers.
But I have some pride. and no one going to think you've cast me off...
Please, Margaret...
You want your precious Elaine, you can have her.
But people are going to know the truth.
I'll start right in by telling the room clerk you've been entertaining your girl in our apartment.
Then I'll call the newspapers.
Careful, cautious Richard.
Destroying everything he is for the sake of a cheap...
Get away from that phone.
You asked for it and you're going to get it.
Leave that phone!
I'll enjoy telling your friends what you've been up to...
Leave that phone or I'll...
I hate you!
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
I'm Lieutenant Stewart.
Oh, yes, Lieutenant. We've been expecting you.
Your wife's certainly going to be glad to see you, sir.
Mr. Blake, this is Lieutenant Stewart.
Mr. Blake's our manager.
Lieutenant, you really had us worried.
I'm glad you finally got here.
For a while I wasn't sure we'd make it.
The weather man threw the book at us.
Well, you're in for a real welcome.
816c, boy.
Oh, that's all right.
I'd kinda like to surprise her.
Very well, sir.
Thanks.
Janet!
Darling, what's the matter?
Janet.
Janet, it's me.
It's Paul.
Janet!
Hello?
Hello, operator?
This is Lieutenant Stewart calling.
Can you send a house doctor up to 816c right away? It's very urgent.
Thank you.
Well?
What is it?
What's wrong with her, Doctor?
I'm not sure. I think she' suffering from some sort of shock.
I'll be frank with you, Lieutenant.
This is a little outside my line.
But there must be something you can do for her.
We ought to call in a neurospecialist, or a psychiatrist.
Can you suggest one?
There's a very good man in the hotel,
Doctor Cross.
If we're lucky, we might find him in.
This is Dr. Blair.
Will you see if Dr. Cross is in for me?
Thanks.
Cross has had a lot of experience with this sort of thing.
I'm all right for a broken arm or an old fashioned hangover.
But when it comes to the mind...
Hello, Dr. Cross.
This is Blair in the hotel.
How are you?
Say, I've run into something that's right up your alley.
One of the guests here has had some sort of shock.
No, I don't know what caused it.
Would you?
That's mighty nice of you.
Thanks, Doctor.
816c.
He'll be right with us.
She was so alive when I saw her last.
I can't quite believe this.
Better snap out of it, Lieutenant.
I don't want another patient.
Dr. Cross is one of the best men in this part of the country.
I'm very happy that he's going to have a look at her.
I don't get it.
What could have brought it on?
I wish I could tell you.
The mind's a strange instrument.
What affects me might not bother you in the slightest.
The workings of the mind depend on so many things inside as well as outside.
You can make hard and fast improvements.
Well, I suppose it is plausible if she hasn't been feeling well.
Worrying about me, not knowing whether I was dead or alive.
Then coming here and not finding me.
That'll be Dr. Cross.
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning.
I appreciate your promptness.
Not at all.
The sooner you get to a case of shock, the better.
This is Lieutenant Stewart.
Doctor Cross.
How do you do, Lieutenant?
Thanks for coming, Doctor.
My wife is in the bedroom.
She doesn't know me.
She doesn't seem to know anything.
Were you here when it happened?
I just got in a few minutes ago.
When I opened the door she was sitting on the divan.
He eyes were wide open.
She was staring at...
At nothing.
Did you notice anything peculiar about her actions when you saw her last?
I've been a prisoner of war for two years.
I've just come home.
Oh, I see.
She's had a rugged time, all right.
First thinking I was dead.
Then hearing from me.
And on top of all that, my plane was twelve hours late.
Would you say that she was a nervous, imaginative girl?
No, sir. I've known her all my life.
We came from the same small town in Michigan.
We went to school together.
She... well, she's just a nice kid.
What's wrong with her, Doctor?
She's had a nervous collapse.
Went into shock.
Where did you find her?
In the living room.
In the living room?
You said she was sitting on the divan.
Yes, right here.
I see.
What do you think would have caused it, doctor?
Well, that's difficult to say.
You have no idea how long she might have been sitting there?
No.
Oh, the clerk did say she phoned down at about one in the morning.
Between one and 8:30.
What difference does that make?
The important thing is what you can do for her.
It's hard for a doctor to make promises.
We can only do our best.
Are you living permanently at the hotel?
No. As a matter of fact, we've got to clear out by noon.
Oh, I see.
Then I'd better take her to my place.
She's going to need someone with her night and day.
Dr. Cross has a private sanatorium just out of town.
I see.
Believe me, Lieutenant, it's best for her.
But there must be a hospital here in San Francisco.
I'd like to be near her.
Of course.
But I'm at my place every day.
It's in the country and she'll get plenty of fresh air and quiet.
If I were you, Lieutenant,
I'd listen to Dr. Cross.
Okay, you men know best.
Just get her well again.
I was getting ready to leave when you called.
I'll take Mrs. Stewart up with me now.
Hello? This is Dr. Cross.
Will you get me my office, please?
I'm going along with her, Doctor.
I'd rather you waited, Lieutenant, until I've been able to give her a thorough examination.
It's quite possible your presence may excite her and do her more harm than good.
It's just that I...
It's been so long since I've seen her.
Why don't you drive up with me tomorrow?
Miss Jordan, will you call the hospital and tell Miss Hatfield to have a room ready for a new patient?
We'll be there shortly.
Yes, that's right.
You pick us up at the hotel.
Right.
You'd better pack a bag for your wife, Lieutenant.
Thanks, doctor.
I'm from Dr. Cross's office.
We were to pick up a patient.
Oh, yes, they're on their way down now.
Thank you.
Your car is waiting, doctor.
Thank you.
This is Miss Jordan, from my office.
Lieutenant Stewart.
How do you do, Lieutenant?
Mrs. Stewart has had a nervous collapse.
What a shame.
Don't you worry, Lieutenant, we'll soon have her well again.
You'll call for me in the morning, right?
Yes, I'll pick you up at 11:30.
Put her to bed and have Dr. Stephens give her an injection of scopolamine.
Yes, doctor.
Miss Hatfield.
Good morning, doctor.
Your patient is coming in at the ambulance entrance.
You have her room ready?
Yes, I have, sir.
Thank you.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, doctor.
How is she?
Quire relaxed, sir.
What's her trouble?
Amnesia shock.
She's had her injection?
Yes, doctor.
She's ready to talk now.
Thank you. That'll be all.
Yes, sir.
I'm Dr. Cross, Mrs. Stewart.
I'm your friend.
I'm here to help you.
I want you to think.
You're going to remember things now.
You went to meet your husband at the Belmont Arms.
Do you remember that?
You were worried about Paul.
He didn't arrive on time.
You were too nervous to sleep.
Did you walk out on the balcony?
I...
Yes.
I walked out on the balcony.
See, you can remember.
But what did you see from the balcony?
They...
They were... quarrelling.
You heard them distinctly?
I...
Did you hear them distinctly?
He's... trying to... stop her.
He's... going to hit her... he's hitting her head...
He's... killing her.
Who? Who's hurting the woman?
That man...
He's her husband.
He's killing her.
Well?
She knows, Elaine. She remembers.
Her room was opposite my apartment.
She walked out on the balcony, she heard everything.
Yes?
Can you come now, doctor?
They're having trouble with Mr. Edwards again.
Yes.
Darling, I didn't think you'd ever get here.
I love you.
You've got a headache.
I can tell from your eyes.
Yes, it's bursting.
You did it?
Yes.
Yes, I did it.
It was horrible, Elaine.
I had the porter take the trunk down.
I told the hotel manager I was joining my... wife in Carmel for a few days.
They shipped the trunk to my lodge.
No one knew she was in town last night?
No. She came up the back way.
She wanted to surprise us, remember?
You're not sorry.
Are you?
I wish I'd called the police.
I lost my head. I didn't mean to kill her.
There was no premeditation.
But now I've concealed her body,
I've shipped the trunk to my lodge... and you know as well as I do there's only one answer to that.
I shouldn't have listened to you, Elaine.
Think, darling.
What would have happened if you'd called the police?
Manslaughter means 20 years.
What would that have done to you, to us?
I don't know.
Would you have wanted it that way?
Now no one knows. We're safe.
You're forgetting Janet Stewart, aren't you?
She knows. What if she talks?
I haven't forgotten her.
She can't tell what she's seen as long as she's in this condition, can she?
The shock will wear off in a couple of weeks at the most.
It'll wear off if you let it, Dick.
Elaine, I'm a doctor!
She'll talk only if you let her.
You mean too much to me.
It's the only way out, Dick.
It's the one and only way out for us.
I don't know, Elaine. I've got to think.
Good morning, Mrs. Penny.
Good morning, doctor.
You're looking very well today.
Thank you, doctor.
Good morning, doctor.
Good morning, Miss Hatfield.
This is Lieutenant Stewart. Miss Hatfield is our head nurse.
How do you do, Lieutenant.
Is Miss Jordan with Mrs. Stewart?
Yes, she is, doctor.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
Janet.
Darling, it's me.
It's Paul.
I'm home, dear.
She's worse.
Not really.
She was restless, and we gave her a sedative.
You've got to be patient, Lieutenant.
It's going to take time.
And you must try to stop thinking of your wife as she was.
You see, when you were reported killed... she had a terrible time adjusting herself.
But she did.
Then, when the news came that you were alive... and on your way home, it was hard for her subconscious to accept that because the first adjustment had been so difficult.
Then, of course, when your plane was late, she thought she'd been tricked. that you'd never sent that wire.
Don't try and let me off easily, doctor.
Give it to me straight.
Tell me, can you help her?
That's a very difficult question to answer.
Sit down, Lieutenant.
The mind is a delicate, fragile thing.
It's almost as intangible as faith.
And that's what you're going to need.
A lot of faith in yourself, and in your wife, and in me..
Please don't think I haven't faith in you, doctor, because I have.
But yesterday after you left with Janet
I needed someone to talk to.
Of course.
So I went to the Army Hospital and I talked with some of the doctors.
I told them Janet was in your care.
They said that I couldn't find a better man.
But...
Well, you know how it is, I figured that maybe two minds might be better than one.
And I asked if another opinion mightn't help.
That's perfectly understandable.
If you want a consultant, by all means bring one in.
Thanks.
They recommended Dr. Franklin Harvey.
Harvey? Well, I studied under him.
He's probably the best man in his field.
Well, that's swell, doctor. I was a little embarrassed.
I didn't want you to think that...
Not at all. I'll phone Dr. Harvey and have him out here.
Good.
Well, I might as well go back to town.
If it's all right, I'll run out again tomorrow.
For Mrs. Stewart's sake I'm going to have to ask you to observe our regular visiting days.
Sundays and Thursdays.
I'll phone Dr. Harvey and try to have him out here Thursday so that you can talk with him then.
Okay, we'll make it Thursday.
I thought you'd like to know, Lieutenant, she's resting quite easily now.
Thanks. Goodbye, doctor.
Miss Jordan.
Bye.
Mrs. Stewart.
Mrs. Stewart.
You're going out on that balcony again,
Mrs. Stewart.
You're looking into the other apartment.
You're listening to the argument.
Do you remember what happened to the woman?
He's hitting her.
He's hitting her with a candlestick.
Now he's hitting you.
Hitting you with a candlestick.
In your head, again and again.
My head is hurting me.
The candlestick is killing you.
Soon you won't be able to remember anything.
You can't hear a sound now.
You can't hear anything.
You can't hear.
You can't remember.
You can't remember.
You can't remember.
Edwards' condition is deteriorating rapidly.
If this continues we will have to take steps to put him in a more suitable institution.
She's exhausted. She hasn't got far to go.
Elaine, do you think you could manage it here alone for the weekend?
Certainly. Why?
The trunk should be there tomorrow.
I've been wondering.
There are no servants at the lodge.
What'll happen when the trunk is delivered and there's no one to receive it?
Nothing.
They'll just leave it on the back porch.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
Dr. Harvey's due here this afternoon.
Harvey? Coming here for what?
Stewart requested a consultation.
You're not going to let him examine her!
Of course.
How would it have looked if I said no?
But he might discover something.
He has no reason to be suspicious.
You can't risk it. I won't let you do it.
I know what I'm doing, Elaine.
Darling, you're not thinking clearly.
I've never seen thing so clearly before in my whole life.
You will send me a report on her spinal test.
Yes, Dr. Harvey.
And the other specimens.
Yes.
You know, Richard?
I'm not sure I completely agree this was all brought on by her husband's late arrival.
That was a contributing circumstance.
I feel there may have been something else.
Well, that's always possible, of course, sir.
But I found no evidence of it.
Just speculation.
Would you have a cigar, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Let's continue the present treatment and see how she comes along.
Yes, sir.
I noticed, Richard, you've been giving her sedatives.
Yes, I have.
She's been pretty difficult at times.
I'd go easy on them.
If she's under sedation there's no way of knowing when she comes back to normal.
No, I plan to take her off them within the next 24 hours.
Fine.
By the way, how's Margaret?
I'm joining her at the lodge.
Give her my regards when you see her.
I will, thank you, sir.
Well, I'd better talk with the young man.
Sometimes I wonder which are more difficult.
Patients or their families.
Hiya, beautiful.
Hi.
What a night.
You don't happen to know a blonde that would like to relax with me, do you?
That's what I thought you'd say.
Coffee?
Please.
Poor Edwards, these storms don't do him any good.
He kept ducking into his closet and slamming the door after him.
I finally had to lock it.
How's your patient?
All right, I guess.
I was talking with her husband.
It's kinda tough.., coming home and finding your wife in that condition.
Yes.
I can't figure Dr. Cross's treatment.
Why keep the poor guy from seeing his wife?
I think it would help snap her out of it if she saw more of him.
Dr. Cross doesn't want her to get excited.
After all, the attack was brought on by worry over him.
Yeah.
That was close.
It's time to turn in.
You'd better tuck your patient in bed and get a good night's sleep.
Yes, I should be up there now.
Tell me, is it true that doctors get a night off once in a while?
If you had a night off, you wouldn't know what to do with it.
Wouldn't I?
Wouldn't I.
Good night, doctor.
Good night.
Well, another stormy weekend.
It isn't my night off.
Well, anyway, the rain will help Jane on her day off.
Who's there?
Why, Mr. Edwards, you shouldn't be in here.
Come, I'll take you back to...
Don't, I...
Mr. Edwards!
Don't be afraid.
We won't let the storm hurt you.
You're coming back to your room, aren't you, Mr. Edwards?
Aren't you, Mr. Edwards?
That's fine.
Come along.
Take care of him, Frank.
Yes, doctor.
Come along, sir.
Are you all right, Elaine?
Yes.
There, there, Mrs. Stewart.
It's all over...
He killed her. He hit her on the head and killed her.
The doctor killed her.
Mr. Edwards became very violent last night.
This morning they found that he had a key hidden away.
I ordered the lock on his door to be changed.
As for Mrs. Stewart, she's suffering from hallucinations.
She keeps insisting that she witnessed a murder, which obviously...
Come in.
Oh, hello, Lieutenant.
They told me I'd find you here.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Not at all.
It's kinda rough, isn't it?
Yeah. She's out of her head.
She's got a crazy idea she saw a murder.
What am I going to do?
You're gonna sit tight. She's in good hands.
So they keep telling me, but...
Well, she's getting worse.
I'm thinking of taking her back to San Francisco to a hospital there.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Lieutenant.
Dr. Cross is tops, you know that.
You brought Harvey in to consult.
You can't do any better than that.
But I can't just sit around and watch her get worse.
I've got to do something.
Lieutenant, I wouldn't try to kid you for the world.
So far we've tried to snap her out of it with quiet, and rest and simple foods.
There are a dozen other things we can do.
Electric therapy, insulin shock...
Insulin shock? They use that in the army on guys who blow their tops.
Sure they do, because it often helps.
But you're not gonna turn it down on that account, will you?
No.
Relax. The setup here is perfect.
Everybody's rooting for you.
Now, just take it easy.
You mean that?
Okay.
Say, put in a couple of extra licks, doctor.
I'd kinda like to take her home soon.
Okay, Lieutenant.
We'll do everything we possibly can for her.
Goodbye, doctor.
Goodbye.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Look at this.
Mrs. Cross is dead.
What?
The body of Mrs. Margaret Cross, wife of the noted psychiatrist, has just been recovered from its resting place among the rocks at Point Lobos.
Mrs. Cross had been missing since Friday night.
Coroner Jess Haines has pronounced the death accidental.
Good morning, doctor.
You have our deepest sympathy.
Thank you.
I'm terribly sorry, doctor.
Thank you. Would you come in, Miss Jordan?
Yes, sir.
You're the perfect picture of a heartbroken husband.
Am I?
I've missed you.
Driving back there was time to think.
I got to thinking about you.
I asked myself,
'Is she worth what I've done?'
Well?
That was a very satisfactory answer.
How did things go while I was away?
Oh, darling, things are going so well
I can hardly believe it.
What do you mean?
Mr. Edwards got out during the storm.
He went into her room.
What?
He went after me. I struggled with him.
She woke up and confused Mr. Edwards with you.
She was thrown back into that night at the hotel.
Oh, Elaine, that undoes everything I've tried to do.
No, Stephens and Miss Hatfield heard her.
They're convinced she's insane.
Now, no matter what she says they'll think she has hallucinations.
I see...
But you don't see, darling.
Before you were trying to make her fret.
Now she can talk her head off and no one will believe her.
If we can encourage her to talk and convince her husband that she's insane, we can keep her here as long as it suits us.
Then have her committed.
Darling...
Janet, darling.
It's me.
Wake up.
I'm here, dear.
Paul.
I've waited all night for you, darling.
What took you so long?
Don't worry. I'm with you now.
We have to be out by morning, Paul.
They won't let us stay.
Lieutenant Stewart.
You shouldn't be in here.
Paul! It's him!
Who is it, dear?
Him!
He killed her.
He killed his wife.
He picked something up, Paul, and he hit her with it.
He was arguing with her and he killed her.
I know, I know, dear.
You've upset her, Lieutenant.
You shouldn't have come in here.
Come outside with me.
Give her a hypodermic, nurse.
Don't leave me here, Paul, come back!
Lie down, easy...
What is it, doctor, what's happened to her?
Lieutenant, I'm going to be perfectly frank with you.
What you've just heard is something I've been afraid of.
There are times when patients emerging from amnesia suffer from delusions.
It doesn't happen often.
I'd hoped it wouldn't happen in her case.
But you heard her yourself.
But why?
Well... it's hard to explain.
But if you come with me,
I think I might be able to clarify it for you.
Hello, Mrs. Penny.
Good day, doctor.
How are you feeling today?
Just fine, doctor, just fine.
That's a lovely thing you're knitting there.
It's a shawl for one of my friends.
Everyone here treating you well?
Oh, yes, they're very nice to me.
Dr. Stephens hasn't tried to kill me with that needle for a long while now.
Neither has Miss Hatfield.
Haven't I told you many times, Mrs. Penny, that no one here is trying to kill you?
Oh, yes they are. You all want to kill me.
You're murderers, all of you.
But I've learned. I'm too smart for you.
What you've just heard, Lieutenant, for the second time, is the typical attitude of many of our patients towards the hospital staff.
But that old lady, she seemed all right.
Mrs. Penny is suffering from a paranoid form of dementia praecox, characterized either by delusions of grandeur or delusions of persecution, or both.
The patient, when confined to the hospital, almost invariably becomes convinced that the doctors and nurses who are treating him are really murderers intent on killing him.
This delusion is quite common among mental cases in an institution of this sort.
Are you trying to tell me my wife is out of her mind?
No. Out of the mind denotes complete loss of reason.
Mrs. Stewart hasn't reached that stage.
But she's got the same crazy ideas as the other patients.
Right now she's merely suffering delusions.
However, I feel it's only fair to tell you, Lieutenant, that this condition can become worse.
Our fight now is to prevent further deterioration of her mind.
You've got to help her, doctor.
You've got to get her well again.
I'll do everything I can.
Believe me.
Come now, Mrs. Stewart, you shouldn't be out of bed.
Will you help me, please?
Please, please help me.
Get the police here, please.
We don't need the police, Mrs. Stewart.
You come along with me and...
You don't understand.
There's nothing the matter with me.
I want the police.
That doctor's a murderer.
You go back to bed and we'll call them...
Don't talk to me as if I were crazy.
I'm telling you the truth.
Orderly! Come along, Mrs. Stewart, no one's going to hurt you.
You're going to be all right.
Orderly!
Let me go. No, I'm not crazy!
I'm not crazy!
I wish you could have been there to see her yourself.
Yes, I heard about it this morning.
She had the usual delusions.
She kept insisting that you were a murderer.
You know how they get.
She wanted me to call the police.
For a moment she became very violent.
I had to give her a sedative.
I think we ought to do something about her.
I agree with you, doctor.
I'll be in to see her in a few minutes.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
There, you see?
Everything worked out just as we planned.
Yes.
Well, smile, darling.
It's fallen right in our lap.
You don't seem particularly pleased.
I am. Of course I am, Elaine.
Well, what are you going to do?
I'm going to try to find something that will convince her that she's insane.
You'd better get back to her now, darling.
I'll be over in a few minutes.
Right.
You feeling any better today?
I'm all right.
There's nothing the matter with me.
Miss Jordan tells me that you're still talking about some woman I'm supposed to have killed.
I've asked you to stop thinking about such things, Mrs. Stewart.
But it was your own wife.
If I could prove to you that you couldn't have seen me kill my wife, would you believe that this is a delusion you've been suffering from?
You were arguing with her about a divorce.
If you look at the date on this newspaper,
Mrs. Stewart, you will see that my wife died only a week ago.
You have been a patient here for over three weeks now.
Three weeks?
That's right.
So you see, this has all been a very vivid dream.
You must fight these dreams, Mrs. Stewart, or they're going to become worse and we don't want that to happen.
My mind is all right.
It's not all right, Mrs. Stewart.
Your mind is sick and it's getting worse.
My mind is all right.
You wouldn't like your husband to see you in that condition, would you?
He doesn't even want to see you when you're like this.
You're losing your mind, Mrs. Stewart.
No, no...
Losing your mind.
Oh, no...
Thank you, Miss Hatfield.
Doctor Cross.
Yes?
There's someone in your office to see you.
Did I have an appointment?
No, sir.
He's from the District Attorney's Office of Monterey.
Oh, yes, thank you.
Doctor Cross?
Yes?
How are you? My name's O'Neill.
I'm with the District Attorney's Office in Monterey County.
Oh, yes. What can I do for you?
It's in connection with your wife's death, doctor.
I thought the case had been closed.
Something happened this week that made us consider the possibility that your wife didn't fall into that chasm by accident.
I don't understand.
A couple of days ago someone broke into Howard Lodge. beat Mrs. Howard into unconsciousness and made off with the valuables.
We caught the thief day before yesterday.
But what has that got to do with Mrs. Cross's death?
It may not have anything to do with it.
It occurred to us that since the Lodge was so close to your place the man who clubbed Mrs. Howard may have paid a visit to your wife.
You've lived around Point Lobos for nearly ten years.
Mrs. Cross spent much of the time there.
She must have known those cliffs pretty well even at night.
Yes...
I'd hate to think that she...
I'm not saying it was murder, doctor.
I'm just checking.
Of course.
I'll do everything I can to help you.
I knew you'd feel that way about it.
Have you checked your place to see if anything was missing?
I'm sure there isn't or I'd have noticed it.
If it's all right with you, doctor, we'd like to have Mrs. Cross's body exhumed.
But the coroner said...
It was only a routine examination.
Well, I don't know if that's necessary,
Mr. O'Neill.
You've got your man.
All we've got is a drunken old tramp who clubbed Mrs. Howard and stole a little money and jewelry.
We can't know about Mrs. Cross unless the body is exhumed.
But it seems almost sacrilegious.
Hasn't she been through enough?
Haven't I?
I'd hoped you'd be more understanding, doctor.
Naturally we'll get a court order, but it would be much simpler if you...
If this tramp killed your wife, you want to see him punished, don't you?
Of course.
Then you can't conscientiously object to the exhumation.
No.
No, Mr. O'Neill, I can't.
If the man is guilty, he must be punished, of course.
Thank you, doctor.
You'll hear from me one way or the other within the next few days.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Darling, I've been so worried.
I didn't know what had happened to you.
Where have you been?
In the city.
When you weren't here for dinner
I began to worry.
What did the man from the District Attorney's Office want?
They're going to exhume Margaret's body.
You're not going to let them.
I had nothing to say about it.
They'd get a court order.
But why are they...
They think some prowler might have killed her.
Prowler?
They weren't looking for anything before.
She slipped and fell and fractured her skull against the rocks.
Now they may discover it wasn't the fall that killed her.
They can't prove anything.
No?
Once they start asking questions I...
That's why I went to the city.
I had to make sure... that I hadn't overlooked anything in the apartment.
Why didn't I report it in the first place?
Why did I let you talk me into it?
If it weren't for that Stewart girl...
If they start asking questions and find her...
Maybe they won't find her.
You've taken care of everything so far.
If we have to, we'll take care of her too.
You're not helping much acting this way.
If a man wanted to, if he had courage... he could get rid of her and no one would ever know.
A doctor has an advantage.
I could give her insulin shock treatment.
Shock treatment is indicated in a case like hers.
I could give her four injections.
Then, with the last one, an overdose.
No one would ever know the difference.
Then we'd be safe.
No matter what the District Attorney's Office found, we'd be safe.
They'd have nothing on us, Richard.
We could get married then.
You'd be yourself again, Richard.
We'd find peace and quiet here, just the two of us.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
Why not?
Is her life more important than ours?
I've had enough, look, Elaine.
I can't go on like this.
Things keep piling up.
First it was Margaret, then tricking that child so that she'd forget.
Then convincing her that she was insane.
There's a limit beyond which even I can't go.
Richard... remember the first night I came here?
Remember?
You were alone.
You were sitting here in front of the fireplace with a sick headache.
The lights were out.
You didn't hear me when I knocked and when I opened the door you said...
'Oh, it's you, Miss Jordan.'
You called me Miss Jordan then, remember?
I told you I had to see you about Mrs. Penny's prescription.
You talked to me and you saw that I was tired and you asked me if I wouldn't have a drink.
I hesitated and you said...
'I won't bite your head off, Miss Jordan.'
We had a drink.
Remember?
We sat here for a long time and then... suddenly you laughed and you said your headache was gone.
You asked me about my family and I told you.
And we both laughed.
Remember?
Then you took me in your arms.
I know you remember that.
I won't do it, Elaine.
I won't do it.
Just a minute, I'm coming.
Hello, doctor.
Come in.
I hope you hadn't gone to bed.
No.
They told me at the hospital
I'd find you here.
I didn't expect to see you so soon,
Mr. O'Neill, I...
I thought you'd phone me if there were any developments.
I had to serve the papers.
Oh, yes?
Coroner's inquest subpoena.
Now it's legal.
What did the coroner find?
Your wife was murdered, doctor.
Oh...
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
Sit down, Mr. O'Neill.
She was beaten over the head, suffered a fracture.
Death was practically instantaneous.
This prowler you told me about, do you think he did it?
It seems so.
He clubbed Mrs. Howard.
Your wife went out the same way.
A pattern.
Killers usually follow a pattern.
You don't know how she was killed,
I mean, the weapon?
She was struck with a candlestick,
A candlestick?
Are you sure?
A heavy silver one.
How can you know?
Microscope.
There were particles of silver in the wound.
They told us it was a silver object.
There were bits of wax mixed with the silver.
They told us it was a candlestick.
It must have been a heavy candlestick to have done the damage.
Just routine, doctor.
A criminal doesn't have much of a chance these days, does he?
No, sir.
By the way, do you have any silver candlesticks at the lodge?
We might have.
I'd like your permission to go through the house.
The murderer may have left the candlestick behind, in which case we'll get fingerprints.
If he got rid of the weapon, we may be able to find the mate.
Then we'll know what to look for.
Of course, go right ahead.
Thanks.
Now if we can find the candlestick, our troubles are over.
By the way, when did you see Mrs. Cross last?
Alive, I mean?
Oh, a couple of weeks before she was killed.
Why?
Can you place it a little more definitely?
I think so.
Things had been piling up around here and...
I needed a change.
So I drove down to Point Lobos on a Friday night.
Anyone see you?
I don't think so. Why?
We're trying to fix the exact time of her death.
Well, I'm not sure anyone saw me.
I drove down there on Friday night... left there around nine-thirty
Saturday night.
Well, it's not too important.
Naturally, I want to do everything I can to help you, Mr. O'Neill.
If I think of anything,
I'll get in touch with you.
Thanks. Sorry to bother you so late.
That's all right.
See you at the inquest.
Good night, doctor.
Good night.
Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep only unto her so long as ye both shall live?
I do.
What's the matter, Richard?
You haven't been yourself lately.
Something on your mind?
Darling, what's happening with us?
Richard, I must speak to you.
People are talking about you and that nurse, Miss Jordan.
How do you like my hair, Richard?
Of course I had it dyed.
Everyone said it makes me look years younger.
I can give her four injections.
Then, with the last one, an overdose.
Then we'd be safe.
No matter what the District Attorney's Office found, we'd be safe.
Get me Lieutenant Stewart, please.
The treatment itself consists of a series of shocks brought on by injections of insulin.
The dosage and the degree of shock is gradually increased until we've reached what we feel is the limit the patient's system can stand.
Well, if you do give Janet this insulin, how certain can you be that it'll help her?
I'm neither a miracle man nor a prophet, Lieutenant.
If medicine were an exact science, and not an art,
I might be able to tell you.
But you think there's a chance.
Yes, I do.
I... I have seen it work in the army.
All right, doctor. Go ahead and try.
Fine.
We'll begin the treatment tomorrow morning.
Give her about an hour and a half.
Doctor...
Paul...
Now watch her.
Dextrose. We'll bring her out now.
Is Dr. Harvey in?
Yes, he's in. Do you have an appointment?
I'll be glad to consult with you, doctor...
I'm sorry to break in this way...
My secretary will make the appointment.
I had to see you, doctor,
It's about my wife.
She's been getting insulin shock treatments...
Now, just a moment, young man.
Oh, it's Lieutenant Stewart.
Well, we've had some wonderful results with insulin.
But after three treatments she still insists she saw Dr. Cross murder his wife with a candlestick.
Murder his wife?
Yes, and she says he's trying to kill her now.
Well, that's a very common delusion.
Mrs. Cross is dead.
And Dr. Cross did live in our hotel.
You and the Crosses were in the same hotel?
The Belmont Arms.
I see.
And when was it she said that?
Yesterday?
Yes. After the treatment.
You realize it's hard to make generalizations.
But as a rule, the patient is completely normal immediately after insulin shock.
They may relapse into the hallucination after this illusive period.
But at that moment, no matter how bad the case... the patient speaks the truth.
You're telling me in your own way that... that Janet's normal.
That she's got something on Cross and he's pretending she's crazy to save his own neck.
I'm not saying quite that, but...
Will you read this, doctor?
Get Dr. Cross at the sanatorium, please.
It seems inconceivable.
Hello, Dr. Cross?
I'm sorry, Dr. Harvey.
Dr. Cross is with Mrs. Stewart.
No, sir. This is Dr. Stephen's day off.
I see. Thank you.
Well, Lieutenant, I think a trip is in order.
She's the only one who knows, Richard.
No matter what O'Neill says or anyone else... if she's out of the way, we've nothing to worry about.
They can hint and guess all they want, but without her they have nothing.
I can't do it, Elaine.
Dextrose. I've got to bring her out of it.
No. No, you can't!
Dick, you can't.
Dextrose, Elaine, I've got to save her, I've got to!
You can't, I won't let you.
We've got to go through with it.
You don't understand, I can't go through with it...
It's her life or ours! No one will ever know.
Elaine!
Richard, listen to me!
Let go of me!
Richard, I love you!
Richard!
Richard!
Dr. Cross, where is he?
With Mrs. Stewart.
Come along, we may need you.
Adrenaline, quickly.
Don't worry, son, she'll come out of it in a couple of hours and you'll be able to take her home in two or three days.
I'm very grateful to you, doctor.
Paul.
Oh, Janet, darling.
September, 13th, in the case of Janet Stewart.
I gave her insulin shock again today for the fourth time.
Can you give me a minute?
Thank you.
Dr. Harvey completed the treatment successfully.
The case is closed.
Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
Come, Poll, do you know my friend,
Lord Mortimer?
Lord Mortimer.
Lord Mortimer.
Lord Mortimer is like a pig.
His brain's small and his belly big.
What's this hubbub?
It's one of the lunatics from the asylum,
I expect, milord.
- A prank? A jest?
- Go and see, John.
Bedlam?
It does not look so merry a place, milord.
Never been there?
You'll have to pay Master Sims tuppence to see all the loonies in their cages.
Maybe they'll teach you some new tricks, Nell.
I have no need of their wit to entertain you, milord.
They say, sir, that one of the poor devils in there fell from the roof trying to escape.
Very regrettable. Well, drive on.
Your Lordship, it seems to me the man was known to you.
I thought I saw him in your company not a week gone by, sir.
Really? Well, let's have a look.
You, there. You with the light.
It is...
It is young Master Colby.
He fell trying to escape.
Some of our boos haven't sense enough to keep safe behind their bars.
Where is Sims?
- Fetch him.
- He is dining out, milord.
Dining out with Colby's blood on his hands.
- Do you know me?
- Yes, milord.
Then tell Master Sims to wait upon me in the morning.
I have some few words
I wish to say to him.
Lord Mortimer is like a pig.
Will you remind Lord Mortimer that I am waiting?
Well, Pompey, are you a pretty boy this morning?
What are you trying to do, Pompey?
Milord, I want to look like the visitor in the hallway.
Sims. I'd forgotten Sims.
You there, clear out.
Send in the good Sims.
First course for milord's rage.
To be eaten with a sauce of lightning, and to the tune of thunder.
Send him in.
Sims.
Quiet! I'll tell you why.
That you hated him, I knew.
That you envied him was known to all... but that you would dare...
Dare to leave that murderous window open... to murder him from spite and envy.
Murder, milord?
There was no murder.
Colby was my guest.
He chose to leave by a window before I could open the door for him.
And then that monstrous accident.
Accident?
Master Sims is writing a new dictionary.
Are accidents contrived, plotted, executed?
Exactly, Mistress Bowen.
This was a misadventure contrived by the victim... and executed by nature's law that all who lose their grip on gutters... must fall.
You stick to that story, Master Sims?
I could never invent one half so droll.
The characters of the tale... two poets, Colby and myself.
But I am not only a poet, but also, by your Lordship's favor... the Apothecary General of St. Mary's of Bethlehem Hospital.
My friend comes to discuss poetry.
I am absent.
My guards mistake him for a madman.
He tries to escape from them and is killed.
Like a romance, milord.
It's a romance that cost me 20 guineas and a night of laughter.
How so, milord?
Lord Mortimer was foolish enough to pay an advance... for poetry promised in the future.
Colby was to write a masque for the fete Lord Mortimer is giving.
If I might offer my humble talents.
Even at the hospital
I deal in wit and laughter, madam.
Are there any who have come to Bedlam... and say the entertainment is not worth the tuppence they paid?
You do not entertain me, Master Sims.
That is because you have a tender heart.
Most people laugh at my ugliness.
It offends me, sir.
To move a lady so beautiful in any way...
- He's gallant, too.
- I am as you wish, milord.
And I will make your fete a frolic you will remember.
How?
Sometimes the success of a play belongs to the players.
What if the masque were performed by my company of wits, the Bedlamites?
Have your loonies perform?
The opposition.
Not John Wilkes himself, nor his whole Whig party... could think of anything as clever as that, eh, Nell?
You didn't think of it, either.
It's one and the same thing.
My friend here thought of it.
Let us say that you inspired the thought, milord.
Do you hear that, Nell? I inspired him.
Let us say that you both inspired me.
Milord and the beloved of milord.
I think you misunderstand, Master Sims.
I am milord's protegee.
I entertain him and he has no more freedom with me than any other man.
In any case... if milord will but give me the day and hour of the fete...
I will prepare a masque of madness that will set you howling.
One week from today at the Vauxhall.
- The company assembles at 8:00.
- Thank you.
By your leave.
A merry notion.
The Lord Mayor will roll in the soup with laughter.
A capital fellow, this Sims.
A capital fellow.
If you ask me, milord, he's a stench in the nostrils... a sewer of ugliness, and a gutter brimming with slop.
But witty.
So he tells us.
Even if his wit is wanting... his Bedlamites will set my guests roaring.
Everyone who goes to Bedlam expires with laughter.
Why don't you go and see them, Nell?
You'll see how funny they are.
Perhaps I will.
Nice fresh toddies.
Ladies come and buy my lavender
My sweet scented lavender
Lavender
Lavender
Nice fresh toddies, all fresh.
Now's the time to scent your handkerchief
Ladies come and buy my lavender
Lavender
Nice toddies...
Good morning, Master Sims.
There is a Quaker waiting for you, sir.
A master stonemason.
Will you have him in?
Podge... where is my rhyming lexicon?
I need a rhyme for Mortimer.
That Quaker, sir.
Whatever are you rattling on about so, Podge?
I have an important commission.
A rhymed comedy for Milord Mortimer.
And you bother me about some sniveling Quaker.
He's been waiting so long, sir.
- Waiting?
- Three hours, sir.
I waited four hours before milord Mortimer... would give me a dog's word.
Let him wait some more.
But he will not wait, sir.
He's a good workman.
And cheap, I'm told.
Cheap?
Let him in.
You may leave us, Podge.
My man tells me you'll do the work cheaply.
With cut stone one foot thick... and the best mortar,
I can do the work for 15 guineas.
What if I were to give you 18 guineas?
It would be too much.
Eighteen guineas and you are to return to me two.
Then you'll have a better price, and I'll have some reason to employ you.
My friend, I have forgotten what thee has said.
If thee do not repeat it, then I can believe no evil of thee.
What kind of cant is this?
I've asked you for a bribe, man.
Have you never been asked before?
This is simple business between us two.
My friend, about the stonemasonry...
I had not looked forward to the pleasure... of seeing you again so soon,
Mistress Bowen.
I have a curiosity to see the loonies in their cages.
And so you shall.
So you shall.
Your riding crop, Mistress Bowen.
You must hang it here.
It's a law of the institute. No weapons.
In heaven's name, why?
In one of his plays, Dekker... a second-rate dramatist of the last century... wrote of those in there:
"Fierce as wild bulls, untamable as flies
"And these have oft from strangers' sides snatched rapiers suddenly
"and done much harm"
Strangely, here, one forgets you are a man of letters, Master Sims.
Our hospital is ancient and well known.
Much written of.
I dare say, no man or woman comes to London from the country... who does not pay his tuppence.
Are they not witty, Mistress Bowen?
And look at the frolic this one treats himself to.
All day long weaving nets to catch peacocks for the royal dinner.
They're all so lonely.
They're all in themselves and by themselves.
- They pay no heed to us.
- You noticed that.
They have their world and we have ours.
Like separate dreams.
Ours is a human world.
Theirs is a bestial world.
Without reason. Without soul.
They're animals.
Some are dogs.
These I beat.
Some are pigs.
Those I let wallow in their own filth.
Some are tigers.
These I cage.
And some, like this one... are doves.
- I've seen enough.
- But you haven't seen the other cages.
I've seen enough!
But you have no idea how merry they can be.
How much amusement they afford.
Amusement?
From that mad girl with her staring eyes?
If I have offended you, Mistress Bowen...
Thank you, sir.
My valet can plait a tress or twirl a furbelow... quicker than a handywoman... but he has no knack with horses.
I was glad to do thee this little service.
I saw thee strike Sims.
Thee shouldn't have done that.
Do you think I'm afraid of him?
- Do you think he could harm me?
- Thee are able enough.
It is those poor ones in there
I'm thinking of.
Sims will make them suffer for that blow.
Are we lovers that you "thee" and "thou" me?
- I've never seen your face before.
- He's a Quaker, Mistress Bowen.
My name is William Hannay.
I am one of the Society of Friends.
I've heard of them.
They turn the other cheek.
There is more to being a Quaker than turning the other cheek... and saying "thee" and "thou."
It is feeling pity for those in there.
As thee did.
Do you think I struck him because I felt pity for the loonies?
- I saw it in thy face.
- Pity?
I had no such feeling, sir.
I struck the man because I wanted to.
Because he is an ugly thing in a pretty world.
There are many ugly things in this pretty world... if thee would but see them.
Master Quaker,
I did not always wear velvet.
I had guessed that.
But where there is one like thee... to wrest comfort from a hard world with wit and cleverness... there are 10,000 who cannot.
I have no pity for them.
Let them do as I did.
But those in there, can they help themselves?
And I have no pity for them, either.
Animals without souls.
That is not thy thought.
Is it not?
Come a week hence to Vauxhall in the evening... and you will see me laughing at these same loonies that you think I pity.
Thee will not laugh at the poor and the afflicted. Not thee.
I've seen great ladies and their hearts were like stone.
- But thee...
- My heart is a flint, sir.
It may strike sparks, but they are not warm enough to burn.
I have no time to make a show of loving kindness before my fellow men.
Not in this life.
I've too much laughing to do.
Flanked by lunacy... and speaking with the voice of youth, our golden age of Reason... will tell you of its brightest adornment...
Lord Mortimer.
Come, Reason, you've wit enough to say a word or two.
What say you to this, Wilkes... a mad boy playing Reason?
That's a Tory joke for you.
And only the Tories will laugh at it.
The opposition wonders what the effect may be on that poor sick boy.
The Tories care only for the jest... but we Whigs have some concern for the humanities.
Do you hear that, Nell?
Give them a jest and they answer with a political tirade.
He said something about the boy.
- The effect.
- Go ask him.
He'll make you a speech on the matter.
"To this pretty world. Pretty world.
"To this pretty world...
"there came...
"Came...
"heaven sent...
"divinely inspired..."
Good. The great voice of Reason.
"The...
"blessing...
"Blessing of...
"Of our age..."
Come on. I spent all morning beating it into your head.
You see, milord...
Reason is overcome with emotion when it must speak of you.
Prod him on, Sims.
Go on. A few more of those golden words
I taught you, lad.
Somewhere I heard that the human body must breathe through its pores.
If you shut those pores...
"A man...
"set...
"like a jewel..."
Another word, good, gentle Reason.
"This...
"prince of men.
"This...
"paragon...
"Lord...
"Lord...
"Mortimer."
Duck him in the river.
A bit of canvas, a handful of coarse sand would get the gilt off.
Master Sims, isn't that harsh treatment for a sick lad?
They have to get the gilt off, if he is to be well again.
So you know that.
Know what, Mistress Bowen?
You know that anyone painted over as thick as that poor lad will die.
If I understand you properly... this boy is dying...
This boy is dead because his pores are clogged by the gilt.
Then, sweet Mistress Bowen... since you are such a stickler for the correct definition... you will grant me the legal fact that this boy died by his own exhalations.
You might say he poisoned himself.
Milord, have we not had enough of this?
Enough of that boring, dull man and his cruelty.
But we're all laughing, Nell.
- I am not laughing, milord.
- He shall make you laugh.
Spare me that.
- But, Nell.
- A boy died tonight.
A boy who had no mind to guide his thoughts or deeds.
Maybe there'll be some concern about that among the Whigs.
Certainly none among the Tories.
You'll find they're laughing, too.
Liberty. That is a great word you Whigs found somewhere.
But, just the same... you'll end either with the pox or on the gallows.
That, milord, depends on whether I embrace your sweetheart... or your politics.
Here is Alfrieda, Queen of the Artichokes.
She will sing for you.
Here's to the maiden of bashful fifteen
Here's to the widow of fifty
Here's to the flaunting extravagant queen
And here's to the housewife who's thrifty
Master Hannay.
This is a strange place to see thee,
Mistress Bowen.
A little dull, perhaps.
But a good enough place to ask the questions I want to ask.
So far I have found thee more ready with answers than with questions.
Don't worry, my questions are pert enough.
First, do you think me a woman of kind heart?
- I have told thee so.
- Why?
I saw thy face at Bedlam.
It had kindness and compassion.
I have never seen that in my mirror.
But let's say I grant the fact.
Let's say I saw things that moved me to pity.
What then, Master Quaker?
Perhaps God sent thee here that thee might find guidance.
- From you?
- I have not said so.
Well, from whom, then?
Perhaps he sent thee here so we might speak together.
I have seen things tonight
I have no liking for.
My friends laughing at sorry idiots brought out from Bedlam to amuse them.
- A poor boy.
- Thee need not tell me.
It's a bad time for the poor, and the people suffer... the ones with wit and the ones without.
And if you feel sorry for them?
- What do you do about all this?
- I do what I can.
I am a stonemason.
- How does that help people?
- I build well.
Let others build as well, and soon this city will become a clean and decent habitation.
But what of me? What can I do?
I'm only a jester to bring laughter to Lord Mortimer's dinner table.
Perhaps even in the amusement of Mortimer... there is a way that thee can help the poor people in Bedlam.
Is not Mortimer a member of the council?
Good. You're not such a fool as I thought you.
But why don't you take off your hat?
Have you no liking for me?
It is a rule among the Friends to uncover only before God.
Milord will see you now, Master Sims.
- Good morning, Mistress Bowen.
- Good morning.
There, Sims. Sit down and wait a bit.
I have news for you.
I trust you enjoyed the fete.
You will hear presently how much I enjoyed it.
Sims, you have no idea what we've decided.
Nell has a splendid notion.
She wants to turn Bedlam upside down and make all the loonies happy as linnets.
Mistress Bowen is very kind.
You can't imagine what a clever vixen she is, Sims.
Thought it all out herself before she even spoke to me.
Beds, blankets.
Some to sew, some to bake.
Good food.
A practical lass.
I can quite understand what Mistress Bowen wants.
We've needed good beds, good food in Bedlam for a long while.
You forgot to mention good treatment, Master Sims.
That, too. I'm sure we could afford that.
You can't imagine the gratitude
I bear you, Mistress Bowen.
These reforms you propose... will make my name stand out in the history of Bedlam.
- We knew you'd agree.
- I'm overjoyed, milord.
Good. You see, it's done, Nell.
- Not a bit of trouble.
- There is but one small point.
The trifling matter of money.
Milord has already thought of that.
Of course. The council will vote the funds.
That's generous of you, milord.
Very generous.
How so, Sims?
What sort of generosity?
Does not milord have property in Moorfields?
A dozen dwelling houses, a warehouse, two inns.
You see, Sims, I know my accounts.
And I know your properties.
They are taxable by the institute.
Therefore, milord, this reform will cost you not less than... five hundred guineas in additional taxes.
But what is that to you, milord, a mere bagatelle.
Some little gift you'd gladly give to Mistress Bowen.
I will relinquish that little gift,
Master Sims.
I gave you no gift, Nell.
She's merely speaking of a gift she's not going to have.
Now take Master Wilkes.
He'd never be so generous.
He would say, "Loonies don't vote."
But that's true.
There's nothing to be had from them.
You were going to do this as a good deed, milord.
Five hundred guineas.
There'd be so much
I would have to do without.
Nell, we'll have to forget this whim of yours.
It is not a whim, milord.
It is the first thing I've ever asked of you.
But milord has to keep up appearances at court.
You've no idea what an expense that is to a man.
That's true. You have no idea, Nell... what a great responsibility it is to be rich.
- What an expense.
- It's simply this, milord.
I've asked you to do a good deed... and you find the very thought of it too expensive.
You have no right to speak to me that way, Nell.
I've all the rights of having put up with you for nearly a year, milord.
Trying to make you laugh.
And then listening to that fat laugh of yours... as it comes rumbling out of your fat throat.
- Put up with me. Put up with me?
- I said so.
Look what I've done for you.
You'd be camping in the rain on Strathmore Common... with the other strolling players, if you hadn't caught my eye.
Do you call that weak and watery vessel your eye?
I would not want to look at the world through it.
I would not want to be a dull man forever in need of amusement.
I would not want to bribe and be bribed... to fawn upon the king and kick the commoner.
In short, milord,
I would not want to be Lord Mortimer.
- You would not want?
- Nor do I want to be with you.
Not for an instant longer.
Maybe being rich and great and powerful is infectious.
It's a disease I don't want to catch.
Goodbye, milord.
Such angry words.
Of course, as I pointed out to you, milord, you have every right to take legal steps.
You've been very helpful, Sims.
But it grieves me, milord, to have been the cause of this quarrel.
It's not your fault. She quarreled with me.
She insulted me.
May I guide you to the door, Master Sims?
You know Lord Mortimer's signature?
Is this not it?
I can recognize a pig's tracks when I see them.
Then you know I have the right to remove the furniture which he loaned you.
Loan, does he call it?
He and that loathsome Sims.
It's all legal. All by order.
Take the things and get out.
That's not Lord Mortimer's.
Leave Poll alone.
She's no present to be given and taken back.
She's been with Mistress Bowen since she played "Aurora" in The Rivals.
We were very good in that.
Serves me right, Varney.
- A kind heart butters no parsnips.
- But what shall we do, Mistress Bowen?
We've got nothing but the clothes we wear and poor Poll.
Poll?
Poll's enough.
Remember, my dear, if gin is offered, you must take wine.
It's more genteel.
But I like gin.
Makes me merry.
You'll be merry enough on wine.
You told me Lord Mortimer likes a witty girl.
Best leave the wit to me.
I'll make you seem witty.
I can crack a joke well enough.
Not in good company, my dear niece.
You're not accustomed to it, you know.
I have known some gentlemen.
But this is a lord.
A man from whose largesse many blessings... can come to the family of Sims.
And just for a little laughter.
That's all he wants... to be amused.
A fine lord, indeed.
Mocked by a parrot.
But this parrot is our key to open milord's friendship to you.
Now remember, you were offended.
You offered money. You...
Milord, a dreadful thing...
Pardon, milord, this is my niece, Kitty.
A charming person.
She does you honor, Sims.
But have you heard the latest news of my lady?
Brave Mistress Nell.
- What a jest she's hit upon.
- You mean the parrot, milord?
It is because of that, that we are here.
A great bit of japery, Sims.
What a vixen!
I hardly thought to find you in such humor.
It's only a jest.
Nell has the bird for sale in the marketplace.
Letting it scream that silly ditty...
"Lord Mortimer is like a pig.
"His brain is small and his belly big."
All London's come to laugh at the bird.
So they have.
And it does you no good, milord.
That joke can make your proud name a mockery.
The bird won't sing too long.
I've sent Pompey to buy it.
That girl holds the bird at a high enough price.
My niece, knowing of my affection for you, tried to buy the bird.
She offered 20 guineas and was refused.
Mistress Bowen wants more honey on her bread than that, Sims.
Pompey has a purse with a 100 guineas in it.
- A 100 guineas for a bird?
- Will you have some wine, Mistress Sims?
Wine is too French for me, milord.
It's the way I feel about men.
I like men to be as big as beer and as strong as gin.
Beer has a head on it, you know... and you can't say that for wine.
And gin has muscle in it.
And you can't say that for wine, either.
Bless me. I have never heard anyone put it that way before.
There is much to be said for our national institutions.
Come in.
She refused?
- She said it was not enough.
- What sort of game is this?
Mistress Bowen told me to tell you... the bird will remain for sale... and that you could sell every property you owned... and not have money enough to buy it.
So that's the way the wind blows, milord.
Malign me!
The girl digs her spurs too deep.
Milord, we can always make her my guest.
At Bedlam?
No.
She's as sane as you and I.
Was Colby mad? He was my guest.
We've been good comrades, Nell and I.
- I'll not do that.
- As you wish, milord.
Here, milord.
Confusion to your enemies.
It's a shrewd trick.
You can't restrain a parrot from slander.
You can't exercise the right of privacy against a bird.
But I think I have a way, milord.
Another drink, milord.
It'll make you a lion.
I'm an angry man.
There are laws against the depredations of livestock.
Is not a parrot livestock?
Are you not suffering great loss?
You know that... he who steals my purse, steals trash, but he who...
Why, I heard that at the playhouse.
What do you suggest?
We can swear out a writ of seizure... send a bailiff for the parrot and have it here within the hour.
- We could do that.
- Indeed we can.
Arrest a parrot?
I'll drink on that, milord.
All right. Come along.
I told thee no good would come of it.
Thee cannot mock thy friends this way.
Mock him? He'll wish I'd only mocked him when I've finished.
Softly.
I swore I'd wring its neck.
Give me that bird, Varney.
Your gifts you can take back, milord... but the parrot was mine, is mine, and remains mine as long as I want.
Thee must be careful of other's property.
Curse you, man.
You shall fight me for this.
- Draw, man, draw!
- Thee can see I carry no weapon.
I do not fight nor brawl with other men.
- You shall fight me.
- I cannot.
Fight or I'll run you through.
- Will you fight?
- Milord.
My friend, thee has no quarrel with me.
Let me go!
Thee must not mock thy friend.
Lord Mortimer.
Thee can earn an honest living for thyself.
I had to sew my costumes when I was on the stage.
Two shillings a week and all found for a seamstress.
One can live well on that if one is frugal.
What would I do with Varney?
Who'd have him?
Thee has not strength enough for a mason, Varney.
- You see?
- Just the same, I'll give Varney work.
He shall sweep up the dust here.
He has strength enough for that.
He sweeps and I sew.
All very fine, but not very exciting.
What do you think about it, Varney?
I like a merry life, Mistress Bowen.
And so, by blazes, so do I.
Everyone makes his living with his own tricks.
My tricks are not yours,
Master Stonemason.
If I may say a word, Mistress Bowen... you still have many friends.
That I have.
There's Captain Stafford.
But he's always talking about Fontenoy.
There's Armiston and Wilkes.
There's Wilkes.
That Devil Wilkes.
So far as I am concerned, dear Mistress Bowen... you need not teach your parrot any special phrases for my benefit.
Am I to understand from that,
Master Wilkes, that you're not interested?
Not in Bedlam nor in me?
I did not mean that.
I meant only that I am a different sort of man from Lord Mortimer.
I am not easily pleased.
I think you expect too much,
Master Wilkes.
I offer more.
You want to fight the nastiness and corruption of Bedlam.
I offer you political alliance with John Wilkes... whom his gracious majesty has pleased to call "that Devil."
Bring me the evidence and I'll be pleased to take it to court.
Let us say that puts a brighter face on matters, Master Wilkes.
One gives a girl a kiss to seal a certain kind of bargain, Nell.
This is a rather public place,
Master Wilkes.
But one shakes hands with a comrade and a friend.
This is a real blow at Wilkes.
That is a blow I'll leave you to administer.
I have one of his to ward away.
And so you see, Mistress Bowen, milord... thought it would be best to make friends again.
On your advice, I suppose, and for some purpose of your own.
Milord, speak to the girl.
Every word he says is true and better put than I could say it.
So, we're friends again.
You go your way and I go my way.
But friends are not that off-handed with each other, Mistress Bowen.
Milord would like to be kind to you.
I'm duly warned. Go on.
Milord thinks you've been looking rather pale of late.
Perhaps the waters of Bath, a rest.
Milord, you know that I have a contempt for certain kinds of money.
How deep that contempt is,
I am about to show you.
The Bank of England thanks you for 300 pounds.
Tomorrow, after the
Commission for Lunacy examines her... she'll strike no more blows, not at you nor at me.
Here. You sign here.
Confound me, Sims, I can't sign this.
She's not mad.
She's not a danger to herself and others as it says here.
Sign, milord. She's a danger to my position and your properties.
Alone she means nothing... but with Wilkes behind her, she's more dangerous to us... than any madwoman.
Well, gentlemen, here is your lunatic.
You're Nell Bowen?
I'm 23 years of age. Born at Rye.
My parents are dead, and I have no husband or child.
What more would you wish to know?
The Commission of Lunacy will frame the questions for you, Mistress Bowen.
Ask away.
Do you know your alphabet?
I know A from Z... and I can read and write as readily as any man I see before me.
Perhaps a little better.
Do you know the difference between right and wrong?
What is right for me is wrong for you, that much I know. And vice versa.
Oh, don't fool yourselves.
A merry answer does not make me a fool, gentlemen.
Ask me a sensible question and you shall have a sensible answer.
Mistress Bowen, is it true that some days past... you refused the sum of 100 gold guineas for a parrot not worth five shillings?
I had my reasons. It was a jest.
You know your sums?
If two and two make four, I do.
Knowing that one number added to another makes a greater number...
I presume you know a large sum of money from a small sum.
I only know that I like large sums better than I like small sums.
Then, why did you refuse 100 guineas for a parrot worth five shillings?
I have told you, it was a jest.
Knowing the value of money,
Mistress Bowen... can you explain why it was you ate a banknote?
For a jest.
Master Sims knows why I ate the money.
To show my contempt for it.
- Is that how one shows contempt?
- No.
But at that moment it was the only way to show contempt.
I was angry and it was the first thing that occurred to me.
Do thoughts like that always occur to you when you are angry?
Surely everyone does foolish things sometimes.
- At a whim, for a prank.
- Is it wise to eat money?
But it was a jest.
Gentlemen, would you permit me to communicate with Master John Wilkes?
He will speak for me.
This is not a court.
You are not in need of any witnesses but your own sanity... and we shall judge the worth of that.
Mistress Bowen... you have asked for voluntary commitment to enter St. Mary of Bethlehem's asylum.
The charges for your care and keep to be borne by Milord Mortimer.
I have here the commission's approval of your request.
The commission has adjudged you insane.
But I made no petition to enter Bedlam.
Perhaps you did it as a jest,
Mistress Bowen.
You're not going to put me in Bedlam?
Not for a little joke. Not for playing a trick.
Milords, gentlemen, please listen.
I am of sound mind. I know what I do.
I know what I say.
I did not ask for admission to Bedlam.
Please!
Here in Bedlam, my dear... we can't feed you banknotes.
Try chewing on this.
- I want a biscuit. Polly want a biscuit.
- Polly want a biscuit?
You see, Varney, now that he's mine...
I've already taught him a new and original trick.
- Yes, milord.
- But Mistress Bowen must have been here.
Now, my love, and how did you spend the night?
- Going on a voyage, milord?
- Voyage? No, not a voyage.
Just a trip to the country to ride.
To smell the innocent air.
To listen to the twitter of the birds.
- To rusticate.
- I see. To rusticate.
I would invite you, my dear, but it's a bachelor affair.
Sports, you know. Manly things.
I see.
All good things must end, milord.
I'll have a bit of the gin.
And another little sip to get rid of the dry taste of piety.
Piety?
I thought there was precious little of that in this house.
There's a Quaker out there who wants to see you.
Pompey is sending him about his business.
Such a person has never been known in this household.
Come now.
Thee must know that to be an untruth.
Mistress Bowen had tea with milord only yesterday.
Your young lady was the one who was telling tales.
There's been no woman in this household but Mistress Sims since I can remember.
So they tell me.
Well, never mind.
- Where is the Quaker?
- He's been and gone.
- He must have just left.
- That's likely.
Apples, apples
Apples a penny, apples
Master Hannay.
I'll tell you where she is, Master Hannay.
I'll tell you where she is.
- They put her in Bedlam.
- In Bedlam?
Yesterday they summoned her.
She's there now.
Friend, thee must come with me.
We shall go to Bedlam.
No, I can't go with you.
I'm employed by milord.
You see, Master Stonemason,
I have to live.
And you yourself said I didn't have enough muscle for honest work.
It's enough that thee is an honest man, Varney.
That thee ran all this way to tell me where she is.
Nell Bowen.
Is that your name they call?
- How do they know I'm here?
- They don't know.
Some of our poor companions spend their days looking out the window.
If they hear a new cry, they repeat it.
Then others take it up and so it goes.
But my name? How do they know it?
Someone must have shouted in the street.
Perhaps someone trying to reach you.
Thank you.
You can't come in.
- By George Sims' order, I suppose.
- Even so.
May I see Sims?
And quickly, too.
- I have been refused admittance.
- That is unfortunate.
- A new ruling. You understand.
- I understand only that I am a free man.
That I have money in my hand.
Thee has no legal right to deny me entry to a place...
- where others have been admitted.
- Quite true.
- Well?
- The warder will take your tuppence.
And now if you will leave your arms at the arms rack.
But I have no arms.
I am of the Society of Friends.
Then I'm afraid we must return your tuppence.
But why?
Did you not quote the law to me?
Let me then quote the law to you.
It is a rule of our institute that all who enter the main hall...
- must hang their arms upon that rack.
- But I have no arms.
Since you have none,
I cannot let you enter.
Thee cannot deny me entry for such cause.
I must.
Save yourself a walk, Quaker. It's locked.
It's a rule, Master Quaker, and I break no rules.
Blast me.
Brother Hannay sauntering as if it were a holiday.
On my own business, friend Smith, and without profanity.
And without this good job of work that we have, Hannay.
- I bid on it.
- And found Master Sims' way... of doing business a little strange?
We've the work. We've the will.
Let's at it, boys.
But thee hasn't the knack of it.
Thanks, Hannay.
Maybe you'd give us a hand.
- There are but three of us.
- I'd just as leave.
You call.
One, two. Heave, all.
- Call.
- One then two. Down we go.
- Thanks, Hannay.
- Thee is welcome.
Now you're here, Hannay. You can see all of Bedlam without paying your tuppence.
- Can't he, lads?
- That he can.
All the wonders of Bedlam, and for nothing.
- That I would like to see.
- This corridor leads to the main room.
It's a little dark maybe, but if you get to the end of it, you'll get an eyeful.
If thee don't mind, I'll go and look.
Nell. Nell Bowen.
Nell Bowen.
- Nell Bowen.
- Nell Bowen.
- Nell Bowen.
- Nell Bowen.
- Nell Bowen.
- Nell Bowen.
Over here, Nell.
Come, Nell.
Nell.
- You've come to take me away?
- No.
- There is no way.
- Find Wilkes.
- Wilkes will get me out of here.
- I had thought of that.
I'll seek him out, but until he can free thee, thee must be patient.
Patient? How can I be patient?
I'm terrified.
- These people are like beasts.
- So thee has that same thought.
- The same thought as Sims.
- No. But they frighten me.
They're dirty, savage, mindless.
- Disgusting.
- Thee wanted to help them.
That's why they put thee here, for trying to aid them.
I still want to aid them, but I cannot here.
Not here where they're all about me.
All I want is release or a weapon to defend myself.
Thee has thy kindness and thy courage.
They can be sword and buckler to thee in this place.
I want better weapons.
I want something more than my naked hands... to help me if there should be trouble.
- Give me a weapon.
- Thee knows I carry no sword.
Anything.
I carry nothing that would harm my fellow creatures.
Your trowel.
- That is to build with.
- It has a point. It has a handle.
Would you have me maimed, scratched, scarred?
My face.
The Lord will not let it happen.
Give me the trowel and I'll not let it happen.
Look at my face again.
Look close.
Shall it be scarred?
God forgive me for what I do.
Forgiven or not, at least I can defend myself.
Now get to Master Wilkes.
Wilkes will have me out of here like that.
- I haven't seen Wilkes in the last week.
- He's never at home.
He's electioneering.
- Where?
- Anywhere in the kingdom.
But it's a matter of import, grave import.
A woman's reason hangs on it.
I must see him.
He's ordered pamphlets and posters from me.
He must come here and when he does,
I'll tell him.
I'll come back tomorrow.
We might ask her, Master Todd.
She seems quite ladylike. Quite sane.
Or as I might express myself before the bar...
compos mentis en lex.
Then I shall ask her.
We can have Dan and the four of us can play Paroli.
Madam, would you care to join us?
We are going to play Paroli.
That's kind of you. But I have no money.
Money? We play on our word.
I have a wealth of words. I don't cheat.
But I warn you, I'm not above amending the mistakes of fortune.
This, Mistress Bowen, is Oliver Todd.
He won't speak to you nor to me, but there's no harm in him.
And he writes and reasons well.
And this is Dan.
Sometimes he fancies himself a dog.
But he has no malice in him.
And he remembers how to play cards.
I am Long.
Sidney Long, the crown solicitor.
Whose enemies will not let him practice at the bar.
I, the most skilled of them all.
I have many enemies.
Many, many enemies.
I understand.
I shouldn't have told you that.
But believe me, we who are near this pillar are the safe ones.
The good ones. The wisest.
That's why they let us have the candle.
But the rest...
You must be careful of the rest.
I am careful.
Let's begin the play.
Now, I will hold the bank.
Twenty thousand pounds.
Five pounds for a card.
Five pounds.
Five whippets, ten bassets, one gazehound.
Anyone wish another card?
Five pounds.
Anyone else?
Banco.
- Paroli.
- Fortune smiles at your first play.
- What card?
- Knave of spades.
You win.
- Eight bulldogs.
- What's that?
A poor wretch.
Sims gave him a dose of iron this morning.
The chains are scruffing his flesh.
Will the warders not help him?
They've heard too many groans to bother.
But what about you?
Don't you ever help the others?
Why should we help?
We are the people of the pillar.
A card?
Wait. I can't play with that going on.
- May I have the candle?
- Be careful of the straw.
Do your chains hurt you?
Where does it hurt?
Here?
Would it help if I put a bit of cloth there to ease your arm?
Better?
He's quiet now. That was kind of you.
It's just that I don't care for sad music with my game of Paroli.
- A card?
- Five pounds.
Ten whippets.
- Any others?
- Fifteen pounds.
Anyone else?
Banco.
A very pleasant group you make, dear people.
It's so nice to find you here amongst the upper classes, Mistress Bowen.
But that's exactly where I expected you to be.
It's a law of physics. The lighter elements, like scum, rise to the top.
Thank you, Master Sims.
A delicate compliment.
I see you've joined what little we have of society.
The group around the pillar.
Is this the brotherhood your Quaker friend preaches?
Or perhaps you're afraid amongst the others.
- I'm not afraid.
- Then you have forgotten.
Forgotten what?
Forgotten that you were going to reform Bedlam.
Cleanliness. Soft beds for the delight of the patients. Good treatment.
You've been here a week, Mistress Bowen, and your only friends are these.
Our nobility.
The brotherhood of man.
Give me clean straw,
I'll make beds for them.
Bandages, I'll bind their wounds.
- Water and soap...
- That I would delight to see.
You shall have water. You shall have soap.
You shall have straw enough.
- I hope you make good use of them.
- I will, never fear.
I leave you to dream of these Augean labors.
And may your dreams be sweet and cleanly.
Rolls
Hot rolls
But where is it?
You promised a chapter for today.
I appeal to you, Master Long. Is it fair?
I support his family, feed his children.
Even pay my tuppence to come in and get my script, and it is not ready.
We've been busy.
We've been helping Mistress Bowen.
Mistress Bowen? Who is she?
A new female warder.
- Now about the next chapter...
- No, not a warder, Master Gray.
An inmate like ourselves who does all she can to help her fellow sufferers.
- But what can she do?
- Look, I'll show you.
What can she do, you ask?
She can feed those who haven't wit enough to feed themselves.
She can wash the helpless.
Cheer the despondent.
She can be...
She is an angel in this darkness.
Very interesting. But this book you have.
Those drawings?
The pictures?
You don't know half their wonder,
Master Gray.
If I could only get a light behind these pages...
I could throw them large as life upon the wall.
Aye, that's not a bad notion.
One could charge admission.
You could even tell the story
Todd's writing that way.
But, you forget.
It's because of these pictures that I'm here.
That and because
I'm the best lawyer in England.
- I, the most skilled of them all.
- Yes, of course.
And you, Oliver... you'd best finish that chapter by tomorrow... or I shall withdraw my support from your family, understand?
Dan, did you chance to see a trowel?
A trowel?
I'll build you a wall, a wall that high.
Master Long, have you seen a trowel?
I beg your pardon?
A trowel. A mason's instrument.
I mislaid it some days ago. I'd like it back.
Yes. A trowel.
I'm not mad, Master Long. I had a trowel.
Certainly, Mistress Bowen.
We'll help you find it.
You think I'm mad.
Sometimes, I think I've gone mad myself.
Scrubbing and making beds... and all for people who don't even know
I'm trying to help them.
They know.
Good morning, Mistress Bowen.
What a happy place this has become.
Everything is so much cleaner.
The idiots even have their faces washed.
Such a little time and this wonderful change in Bedlam.
What wonders will you not accomplish in a lifetime?
Madam, you are to be congratulated.
- What do you want?
- I want only to reward you.
Did you not ask for a separate sleeping apartment?
I'd like to sleep in peace.
- The main room is noisy at night.
- And I have a room for you.
A pretty chamber.
If you will come with me?
Unfortunately, you will have to share this comfortable apartment with one other.
- But I'm sure you won't mind that.
- Better one than 100.
This is your new chamber, my dear lady.
Won't you enter?
You've not driven me mad yet, Sims.
I would not go in there.
And I wanted so much to please you.
Wait. This was to show you... that all those mawkish theories you learned from the Quaker are lies.
Men are not brothers.
Men are not born good and kind.
Even the mindless ones are savage and must be ruled with force.
I know your thoughts on the matter, Sims.
They do not interest me.
The others, yes. You can prove the little value of gentleness.
But look at this man. Look at him and tell me that kind words... and tender deeds can rule him. Look.
I am looking. It proves nothing.
But you don't dare enter the cage with him. That proves much.
That proves the falsity of all that you've come to believe.
- It does not.
- Then enter the cage.
Gentle him with a word.
Conquer him with kindness.
Or admit that your Quaker lies.
You would enter?
My friend, you do not wish to hurt me, nor I you.
I...
Perhaps you'd like to talk.
I will listen to you.
I...
I know, you're trying to remember.
Someday you will.
You will remember.
You will remember.
Someday you will remember.
And the bailiff came and she went with him to Bedlam.
Apparently, Sims fears an investigation.
Men have rid themselves of unwanted wives by that sweet expedient.
But it takes Sims to forestall criticism with imprisonment.
I shall not believe such ill, even of him.
But she is there. I've spoken with her.
She is as sane as thee or me.
Mistress Nell with that bright, quick mind of hers... saner than either a politician or a Quaker.
This is still England, Hannay.
And we have laws here.
Laws of right and justice.
And I shall see that Sims feels their full weight.
We'll have Nell out of Bedlam in a twinkle.
Never fear.
"Let Hull, house of Hull rejoice with Subis a bird called the Spight
"which breaks the Eagle's eggs"
That's not right.
"Let Scroop, house of Scroop rejoice with Fig-Wine
"Palmi, primarium vinum
"That's not so. Palmi-primum is the word"
That's not right.
"Let Hollingstead, house of Hollingstead rejoice with Sissitietaeris
"herb of good fellowship
"Praise the name of the Lord
September, 1762"
That's not the word of truth.
The word of truth is peace.
Wallace, Betty. Stop.
We were fighting over truth.
Wiser people than you have fought over it, Betty.
Mistress Bowen.
A word with you. I have good news.
You are to have a new hearing before the Commission.
- When?
- When it pleases the Commission.
It will please them to hold your hearing tomorrow afternoon.
I'm delighted for your sake.
Indeed, I am so pleased...
I want to do everything possible to make sure that your hearing is a success.
- That you will be released.
- Thank you.
In fact, I have ordered my most beneficent remedy for you.
- A remedy, Master Sims?
- Have they not told you?
It's my own invention. A cure.
Specific for the lax and wandering mind.
Look at him.
When he came here, he had but one concern... to remember something he had forgotten.
I tried to help him with my remedy...
- but perhaps I was not drastic enough.
- I need no cure.
- Just to be sure, Mistress Bowen.
- No.
I've given you an invitation.
Now I must speak as your physician.
Come with me.
I'll take my chances with the commissioners. I need no cure.
As the Apothecary General of Bedlam,
I order you.
- No.
- Lf you insist upon it, I must force you.
Force me? Here? Look around you.
- Do you think your friends will help you?
- I have helped them.
You expect them to band together and overwhelm me?
If they could reason so, they would not be here.
I warn you, Sims. They know me.
They know I've helped them, been kind to them...
And so they love you and will aid you.
Again that Quaker nonsense.
- Let go of me.
- Hold him.
- Warders, help! Warders!
- Shout away, Master Sims.
Your men are used to Bedlam and its noises.
They've heard too many cries to pay attention to one.
As for me, I'll just borrow your keys,
Master Sims.
No, Mistress Bowen. Not that way.
There's a warder in the hall and another at the front door.
But you heard him threaten me with the treatment. I cannot stay here.
There's a little window that is left unbarred.
I think I know that window, Master Todd.
You must be mad if you think I'd climb through that window as Master Colby did.
- And others before him, I dare say.
- I'm not mad, Mistress Bowen.
I'm not like the others here.
I have been placed here by my family... to keep me from drink, so that I may write and support them.
I know that little window is dangerous.
Designed for a death trap.
But those who tried before were men of small strength.
- I'm no Hercules.
- Tom could lift you through that window.
You have more reason than the rest.
I expect more of you.
You know what I can do, don't you?
Then go to the door.
Call the warders for me.
Do as I say!
But the rest, what will they do to me?
Don't be afraid of their vengeance.
They can't think far enough ahead for that.
They're lunatics. They've been tried and found incompetent by fair trial.
Trial.
Quo warranto.
Corpus delicti cum grano salis.
Yes, I'd forgotten you were a lawyer.
A lawyer, sir? I am a judge.
I am a judge.
I, the most skilled of them all.
And you shall be judged.
Judged, I say. Bailiffs, hold this man.
- He disturbs the court.
- You can go through that door.
- Try him.
- A fair trial for Master Sims.
- A fair trial.
- Mistress Bowen, speak to them.
- Please speak to them, I beseech you.
- Give Master Sims a fair trial.
Tom, you must get up on the roof.
You're to go first, and then you are to pull me up.
Up. You understand?
Tom.
Tom.
I am Solomon the Wise. Split him in two.
Split him in two.
And so we have brought this man before you... to answer for these crimes.
These crimes, which I shall number for you:
- Neglect.
- Yeah.
- Cruelty.
- Yeah.
Whippings. Beatings.
Dirty straw to lie upon.
- Yeah.
- Chains.
Starvation. Stealing our food.
For all these crimes, milord and gentlemen of the jury...
I ask justice.
Kill him.
No. Let me speak.
Please, my friends, I beg of you.
Let me speak, let me speak.
- William.
- This is God's house.
- I broke free from Bedlam.
- But thee should not have run from there.
Thee were to have a new hearing tomorrow.
If I had lived until then.
He had some treatment he was to give me.
A treatment that made even the maddest of them shudder to hear.
- I ran and they have him now.
- Who has him?
The loonies. They have seized him and are trying him in mockery.
They will kill him.
It is what he deserves.
Thee should not speak that way of any man.
- They will. They will kill him.
- Then thee must go to him.
Thee must speak to the poor afflicted ones and save him.
- Save him?
- Can one know what is in his mind?
Can one know what sickness lies in it?
As thee were kind to those in Bedlam... so thee must be kind to those whose sickness...
- forces them to hurt their fellow man.
- But Sims?
Has not Sims a madness that thee can pity?
Come, we'll get Wilkes. He'll help us.
- But why, Sims, why?
- I did not want to hurt you.
I did not want to put chains on you, to steal from you, to starve you.
But you did. And now it's our turn.
You will not dare harm me.
They'll load you with chains, scourge you with the cat.
Then you shall really know what cruelty can be. I warn you.
Your vengeance isn't our present concern.
What you have done concerns us.
- Why you did it.
- I've told you, because I had to.
Even as you do things because you have to do them.
- Even as you drink.
- But why?
I was frightened.
Did you beat us out of fright, Sims?
Did you starve us out of fear?
Split him in two.
Is that why you still threaten us if harm comes to you?
- The rods, the chains. I warn you.
- You spoke of your fear.
- Fear of what? Speak quickly.
- Of the great world.
The great world of this age that gave me my place. The comforts and the authority.
What little I have of riches.
What that world thinks, I must think.
What they do, I must do.
But you know better. You're a scholar.
A man of letters.
What I know means nothing.
I've had to fawn and toady, and make a mock of myself... till all I could hear was the world laughing at me.
But once I had what I wanted...
- This, my place here...
- You were afraid to lose it?
I could not.
I had to please those to whose favor
I owed everything.
- I was afraid.
- You had to strike us?
Yes. Can't you understand?
- I understand.
- And our punishment?
Let me go and there will be no punishment.
He is sane. There is a fear within him.
A fear that strikes out, that claws and tears at the world like a singed cat.
- He is sane.
- He will not punish us.
- He is sane.
- The man is sane.
- Split him in two.
- No, wait. Wait, I say.
This man has been judged sane.
He has no place here. He must leave.
You cannot harm him. No.
It is the order of the court that he is sane and that he shall be free.
Bailiffs, release the prisoner.
They will punish us for this. All of us.
The Apothecary General is dead.
We must hide him somewhere.
We must hide him, so that they will never know.
And when we got here, Master Wilkes, he had gone.
Long said he just left.
- Disappeared.
- Yes, that's all I could get out of Long.
But I know they must have killed him.
It's so preposterous, Master Wilkes.
A man like Sims doesn't just disappear.
And that's precisely why he disappeared.
They tried him... found him guilty of sanity, then let him go.
Can you imagine what was in his mind?
The mind of this man who had sworn... by all that was holy to aid and protect these people.
Can you imagine his feeling of guilt?
I think that's what drove him to run away.
No. They killed him.
Killed him and hid his body somewhere.
You can't prove that without finding his body.
We shall find it and we shall punish them.
Yes, I know. The chains, the beatings.
I tell you it's no good.
What you need here is a better man to fill the post that Sims has fled from.
And after him a better man. And so on until things here are as they should be.
All kindness and care for these poor, sick people.
You're not going to tell them?
You must know what it will mean to those people in there.
Is it not worth a little silence to save them suffering?
- I must tell the truth.
- But no one has asked you.
I have heard there was much rejoicing in heaven... for the lost lamb that returned to the fold.
Silence can win you a lost lamb,
Master Hannay.
That's a fundamentalist theory.
I do not care what it is.
I'm only asking you not to add to the burden of those poor people.
- You, who profess to love them.
- Do thee think that I would tell?
These people are not guilty under the law.
Not answerable for what they do.
Why should I add to their burdens?
I should never have thought that of thee.
I should have known that thy hand would not add to the weight that they must bear.
Thee has too much heart for that.
Are we lovers that you "thee" and "thou" me?
English
- Walter Craig.
- How do you do?
- You're Eliot Foley.
- That's right.
So glad you were able to come.
Let's have your bag.
And put the car away afterwards.
It struck me, after I'd telephoned you, rather cheek on my part, asking a busy architect like yourself to come down and spend the weekend with a set of complete strangers.
Not a bit.
We're pretty cramped for space here.
We need at least two more bedrooms.
- And with only one living room.
- Yes only one, living room.
However, we'll go into all that in the morning shall we?
- Know this part of the world at all?
- No.
I've never been here before.
- No, not actually.
- Well, let me take your things.
Fancy you spotting that.
Trained professional eye?
Yes, of course.
Well, we've got several other guests, so I put you in the barn.
But don't get worried. It has central heating and every modern convenience.
The very words I was going to use.
- This way. I expect they've started tea.
- Yes.
Yes, they have.
Mother, this is Mr. Craig.
I'm so glad you're here.
How do you do?
Well, come along in.
Let me introduce you to the others.
- Mrs. Cortland.
- How do you do?
- Dr. Van Straaten.
- How do you do?
I'm very pleased to meet you.
- And Mr. Grainger.
- How do you do?
And this is Sally O'Hara.
How do you do?
You must be tired after your drive.
Come and sit over here by the fire.
I can't tell you how delighted I am you were able to accept my son's invitation.
You see, we're both such admirers of your work.
You'd like some tea, wouldn't you?
Do you take milk and sugar?
Milk and sugar, Mr. Craig?
Milk and sugar, Mr. Craig?
You're still there.
- So it isn't a dream this time.
- I beg your pardon?
Yes, it isn't a dream this time.
I must be going out of my mind.
Really.
Of course. Dr. Van Straaten.
You're a psychiatrist.
You always treat me.
You'll treat me now, won't you?
You must forgive me.
I don't quite understand the joke.
It isn't a joke. I only wish it were.
I've seen you in my dreams.
Sounds like a sentimental song, doesn't it?
I've dreamt about you over and over again, Doctor.
That hardly turns you into a mental case.
After all, recurring dreams are quite common.
But how did I come to dream about you?
I've never set eyes on you in my life.
It's very likely you've seen my photograph in the papers.
That's why my face seems familiar to you.
I don't think so.
And even if it were, is that any reason why I should keep on dreaming about you?
- No.
- After all, you don't mean anything to me.
Well, maybe an association of ideas.
I may be linked with something that means a great deal to you.
Such as?
I should have to psychoanalyze you to find that out.
But it doesn't end there.
You see, everybody in this room is part of my dream.
- Everybody.
- Gosh.
- Good lord, really?
- Very extraordinary.
- You're kidding?
- Not all of us?
I can only tell you that when I came into this room,
I recognized you all instantly.
Having seen all our photographs in the newspaper, if I take it, Dr. Van Straaten.
Of course, you may have seen me on the sports page. Motor racing's my line.
And there was one of me once, in the Kentish Mercury, when I was a bridesmaid at my sister's wedding.
You remember.
Oh, but I shouldn't think you'd come across that.
- Well, I've never had my photograph taken.
- Oh, yes, you did, dear, once.
You know the one.
Naked on a white fur rug.
You were six months old.
Good lord, that's right.
I don't think he'd recognize me.
I was much fatter.
Surely, Mr. Craig, you might have seen any of us sometime or another.
- In the street or anywhere.
- Yes.
But why should I always dream about meeting you all together, here, in this room, that I've never been in in my life until today?
Mr. Craig, can you describe what happens in your dream?
Well, not in detail.
But it always starts exactly the same as when I arrived just now.
I turn off the main road into the lane.
At the bend in the lane, the house comes into view, and I stop as I recognize it.
Then I drive on again.
And Foley meets me at the front door.
I recognize him too.
And then, when I'm taking off my coat,
I have the most extraordinary feeling.
I nearly turn and run for it... because I know I'm going to come face-to-face with the six of you.
Well, you've only come face-to-face with five of us so far, not counting Eliot.
That's right, five of you.
There is a sixth person who comes in later.
Can you describe this late arrival?
It's an attractive girl with dark hair.
Is that all you can tell us about her?
She comes in, quite unexpectedly, and says something about not having any money.
A penniless brunette, eh?
How romantic. Do you fall madly in love with her, Mr. Craig?
Have you ever told anyone about your dream?
No, I don't think so.
Not even my wife.
Now I come to think of it, after I wake it never stays in my memory for more than a few seconds.
And none of it ever comes back to me until the next time it starts.
In fact, there's no evidence that you ever dreamed this dream at all, is there?
None whatever.
I haven't a scrap of proof.
Personally, I don't need any.
I believe what you say, Mr. Craig.
I believe you really have dreamt about us all.
So do I.
- And so do I.
- Me too.
I think I do too.
I don't question that you have been subject to a recurring dream, and no doubt it has a background vaguely similar to this.
That would be quite enough to account for your feeling that you have been here before.
It's quite a common experience.
- And that's all there is to it?
- That's all there is to it.
Well, I must say it's very disappointing not to be one of the leading characters in a sort of supernatural drama after all.
- Cigarette, anyone?
- You never know.
Perhaps it's like the Red King's dream in Alice Through the Looking Glass.
None of us exist at all.
We're nothing but characters in Mr. Craig's dream.
That's right. And when he wakes up, we shall all vanish into thin air.
Dear me, what a morbid notion.
Let's get this straight, Doctor.
You won't for a moment admit the possibility of foreseeing the future?
Not for a moment.
Well, you'd say I was a pretty ordinary, down-to-earth sort of person, wouldn't you?
I refuse to commit myself. Why?
Well, when it comes to foreseeing the future, something once happened to me that knocks your theories into a cocked hat.
Something I'll not forget to my dying day.
As a matter of fact, it very nearly was my dying day.
Now's my chance.
I can't make it.
I can't make it.
Yes, I can.
This is it.
How long is it since the crash, Nurse?
Six days?
No, seven, Doctor.
There's no injury to the brain.
I'm certain of that.
His mind cleared completely this morning.
He asked about the other driver.
I told him he was unhurt.
He slept quite peacefully for the next two hours.
It's the temperature that worries me.
Let me know at once if it goes up again.
I shall be in number 18.
You're here, Peggy?
All the way from Scotland?
All the way from Scotland.
But you're not Peggy, are you?
No, I'm awfully sorry.
You've been calling me Peggy for days.
My name's Joyce.
Something's sort of soothing about you.
You'll not go away and leave me, will you?
- I won't.
- Promise?
Yes. If you'll promise to try and go quietly to sleep.
I'll do anything you say.
From then on, my temperature began to slide back to normal.
It was a grand job of nursing on Joyce's part.
Tell me frankly, darling, am I out of the wood yet?
Well, you've stopped being delirious.
At least I think so. It's hard to tell.
You talk such nonsense.
I still have awful bad nightmares.
Nightmares? I thought you said you always dreamt about me.
So I do. I dream you turn me down to get married to Dr. Albury instead.
You needn't worry.
He has a wife and three children.
Oh, good for him.
It's a lovely night.
Quarter to ten. Long past your bedtime.
Listen, darling, I'll put it to you.
There's only one way to cure me permanently and that's to marry me.
- It's your professional duty.
- You've got a hope.
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.
You
Why do you pass me by?
How can you treat me so
When you know
All that you mean to me?
You said in days gone by
Just room for one inside, sir.
My dreams
Like all your promises, are broken
But not a single word was spoken
Not even good-bye
The love ends
You...
It couldn't have been a dream.
I hadn't had time to fall asleep.
Nurse had only just left me.
Yes, you checked the time.
It was no more than five minutes.
Does that mean I'm going crackers?
My dear chap, of course not.
In the split second before your car crashed, you were firmly convinced you were gonna be killed, weren't you?
Let me think.
Yes. Yes, I was.
- And that fear has remained with you.
- I wasn't conscious of it.
You mean in my subconscious mind?
You'd already passed the purely physical crisis.
That apparition of death is what we call the psychological crisis.
Yes, maybe.
But suppose I go on seeing things?
You won't.
In fact, I'll lay two-to-one in pounds we have you out of here in a week.
- It's a bet. If I lose, I win.
- All right.
As a matter of fact, I won.
That is, I lost, if you see what I mean.
Albury was right.
I made marvelous headway
and was able to leave the nursing home before the week was over.
Excuse me. Can you tell me the time?
- Yes, it's quarter past 4:00.
- Thanks.
Just room for one inside, sir.
So you see, if I hadn't seen that man driving the hearse,
I wouldn't be alive to tell the tale.
A bit thick for the passengers on the bus, wasn't it?
Yes. The hearse driver might have tipped them off too.
Perhaps he did, dear.
But perhaps they were all doubting Thomases like Dr. Van Straaten.
This time you have got your evidence, Doctor.
Mr. Grainger told the specialist about the hearse before he went to catch the bus.
I'm afraid that does not prove that the bus conductor had the features of the hearse driver or that he said,
"Just room for one inside."
But he had, and he did.
Nothing will ever shake me.
That hearse driver was sent to me as a warning.
I agree. Otherwise, why didn't he board the bus?
Exactly.
Because he hadn't recovered completely yet.
You were still obsessed by your crash.
It made you reluctant to board any kind of vehicle, didn't it?
Sorry, Doctor, I'll not buy that one.
Well, maybe as well.
You cling to your belief, my boy, that providence is specially concerned about your survival.
No use, Grainger.
We're both in the same boat.
We'll never convince him.
What Dr. Van Straaten wants is genuine firsthand evidence, the kind that would satisfy judge and jury.
And neither of us has been able to produce that... yet.
Darling, where on earth did you spring from?
Brenda suddenly changed her mind about staying up in town.
Would you pay the taxi, darling?
I spent my last penny on the train fare.
- Hello, Eliot.
- Hello, Joyce.
My dear, I am glad you...
Your penniless brunette.
All right, I'll pay the taxi.
I made a dash for Charing Cross and just caught the 3:15.
A delightful surprise, my dear.
Though no surprise to Mr. Craig.
Let me introduce you.
Mr. Craig, Mrs. Grainger, your dream come true.
Yes. She's the sixth person.
Sixth person? Are you playing some sort of a game?
Well, not exactly a game, my dear.
Mr. Craig has been dreaming about you for years.
- What?
- Not only you, darling, all of us.
Come upstairs and take your things off.
It's all perfectly simple, really.
It's just like your husband's hearse.
Oh, I don't mean his hearse.
I mean the one he saw when he was in your nursing home, or rather the one
Dr. Van Straaten says he didn't see.
Oh, dear, I think I'd better start again.
You see, Mr. Craig has been having the most frightful dream.
Penniless brunette laid on according to plan.
How's that for evidence, Doctor?
Naturally you'll say it's a pure coincidence.
Oh, you can't say that, Doctor.
With the odds a million to one against?
You know, I am a little indignant.
I am driven to the conclusion it's all part of a very carefully prearranged plan, an extraordinarily elaborate practical joke at my expense.
Oh, really?
Are you serious to think we cooked the whole thing up between us?
Well, as an explanation, it's not any more far-fetched than Mr. Craig's.
Then the joke's on me too, for I didn't know anything about it.
A funny sort of practical joke.
It isn't funny.
What conceivable motive do you think we possibly could have had?
No doubt you thought it would be very amusing to watch my cherished disbeliefs being shattered.
Very clever of us, I must say.
I wonder if we have any more surprises up our sleeves.
That's it! Your glasses.
What about my glasses?
It's later on. We're having drinks.
You break those glasses of yours.
And then, quite suddenly, the room goes dark.
Then, Foley, you say something, something about the death of a man I've never heard of.
And that's where my dream becomes a nightmare, a nightmare of horror.
Horror? What sort of horror?
I feel my willpower draining away.
I feel I'm in a grip of a force that's driving me towards something unspeakably evil.
It shows that you have some heavy weight on your conscience.
- Now, in my opinion...
- I'm no longer interested in your opinion.
You shook me at first with your ingenious theories.
I thought perhaps the whole thing was a delusion.
But Mrs. Grainger's arrival has altered all that.
I have been here before in my dreams.
For some reason, I was given foreknowledge of the future.
Why? I don't know.
I want to know. I must know.
Sally, dear. I think perhaps it's time you were going off home now.
Mother means she doesn't want your infant mind warped, my pretty.
I'm sorry, Sally.
I didn't mean my fear to frighten you.
It's all right, Mr. Craig. It didn't.
All the same, I'll go if you like.
But it seems rather silly to me, considering I've had some myself.
- Some what?
- Subconscious thingamajigs.
Or whatever Dr. Van Straaten makes out they are.
I had an absolutely staggering one last year.
Save it for the school magazine, old girl, and run along home.
Thank you my nice tea, Eliot, and for calling me a liar.
- Good afternoon.
- Please let her stay, Mrs. Foley.
I should like to hear about your subconscious thingamajigs.
- You would?
- Yes.
Not that it'll cut any ice with you.
Well, we were spending Christmas down in Somerset.
I'd been asked over to a party by an old school friend of my mother's, poor Mrs. Watson.
There were a lot of other kids there, mostly younger than Jimmy Watson and myself,
so we let them choose the games.
Nobody else could have such a silly nose.
It's Jimmy.
Wow, you should talk.
What should we play now?
Musical chairs!
- Sardines!
- Oh, yes! Sardines!
All right. Sardines it is.
Sardines?
Don't you know about sardines?
It's a sort of hide-and-seek.
Who's to hide?
- Sally!
- All right.
Anywhere in the house, bar the kitchen.
Cook's in a state.
But I don't know my way about the house.
So much the worse for you.
Now, I'll count 30.
Turn your backs, everyone.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14,
Off you go. Come on, quickly!
- Got you!
- It's all right. I'll go quietly.
Now, I'll stop here with you.
When somebody else finds us, they pack in too, like sardines.
It's cold in here.
Cold, eh?
That better?
It's no mortal cold, Sally.
It's a cold from beyond the grave.
What are you talking about?
Believe it or not, this house is haunted.
I don't believe it.
Well, everybody around this part of the world says it is.
I'll bite. Tell me.
They're bound to find us here.
I know a much better place. Come on.
Go on about your precious ghost.
Well, there was a murder committed here in 1860, I think it was.
Come on.
The girl who did it must have been crackers, I suppose, really.
Strangled him, then half cut his head off.
How revolting.
Of course, there's lots more, but you're too young.
And where does the ghost come in?
Well, I don't know, really.
Nobody's ever heard or seen anything, actually.
And we've been here six months.
I expect it's the girl going around in a long, white nightgown.
Whistling winds.
Clanking chains!
Bloodcurdling screams.
I suppose she's seeking forgiveness for her crime.
Search me. I say, give us a kiss, Sal.
Don't kid me that's part of the rules for sardines.
Hey, Sally!
Sally, wait for me!
Who's that?
What is it, darling?
Come on, now. Stop crying.
Did you get separated from the others?
Let's go downstairs where it's nice and warm.
No.
Stay with me.
It's better now that you've come.
Isn't it silly of me?
I don't remember noticing you downstairs.
Are you one of the Headingly children?
My name is Francis. Francis Kent.
This is my bedroom. Mine and Constance's.
- Constance?
- She's my half sister.
She's grown-up like you.
I didn't notice her either.
All the other girls seem much younger than me.
I wish you were my sister.
You're so kind and nice.
Why? Is she unkind to you, darling?
She hates me.
She said she'd like to kill me.
Oh, don't. You poor little thing.
But I'll be quite different now, now I've met you.
I'll be able to sleep.
Poor Francis.
Come along. I'll help you.
Has anybody tried the playroom?
Nanny insisted on locking it, and she's got the key.
Gosh!
We've forgotten the linen cupboard!
Come on!
Smiles await you
When you rise
Sleep, pretty darling
Do not cry
And I will
Sing a lullaby
- Good night.
- Good-bye.
Sally! Sally, where are you?
We give up.
I can't find her anywhere.
Sally!
Sally! Sally!
It's all right. Here I am.
Oh, there you are. I was wondering where on earth you'd gotten to.
I found another door behind a wardrobe, then along a corridor, and then to the room at the end.
Oh, there. But that's where the whole thing happened.
Hey, Sally!
- So there you are, Sally.
- Meet your new nanny, Mrs. Watson.
- What do you mean, dear?
- I found myself in a sort of nursery.
I didn't know any of the children were staying the night.
- Staying the night?
- Why, yes.
This little boy said he was sharing a room with his sister.
Which little boy?
He told me his name was...
Francis Kent.
Francis Kent?
Come off it, Sally.
- So you knew all the time.
- Knew what?
About Constance Kent murdering her brother Francis, of course.
I didn't know.
So that... that little boy, it was...
I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened.
Oh, please hold me tight.
Hold me tight.
Mother said I must be sickening for something and made me stay in bed with three hot water bottles.
She didn't believe a word of it any more than Dr. Van Straaten does.
In the past, of course, that type of experience was very frequent among saints.
Saint Joan, for example, and Saint Theresa record some visitations of an exceedingly tangible character.
- I'm in jolly good company then.
- Not at all, my dear.
I decline to believe that you are on such an exalted spiritual plane.
I think you're all being ridiculously weak-minded, letting Dr. Van Straaten lay down the law.
When I was a nurse,
I came across a lot of things that doctors didn't just dismiss in an airy fashion.
I believe in Sally's story and in Mr. Craig's dream.
Good for you, darling.
So we're all powerless in the grip of Craig's dream.
- That's a solemn thought.
- I think it's awfully exciting.
Well, if I'm a puppet and Mr. Craig's pulling the strings, the least he can do is to tell me a little bit more about the part he is giving me to play.
I wish it were as easy as that.
But trying to remember a dream is like...
How shall I put it?
Being out at night in a thunderstorm.
There's a flash of lightning.
And for one brief moment everything stands out vivid and startling.
And what have the lightning flashes illuminated so far?
One thing is very vivid and very horrible.
I hit Sally savagely, viciously.
Oh, no, you won't. I shall stick close to Mr. Grainger. He's bigger than you.
Well, anyway, it isn't consistent.
I shan't have a chance to because you leave here quite soon, quite suddenly.
- You're certain of that?
- Absolutely certain.
Splendid! Then I suggest
Sally stays to dinner.
- That'll break the spell.
- An admirable suggestion.
It's absolutely thrilling.
I'll ring Mother and get her okay.
Tell her Eliot will run you back in the car.
- Mother!
- Really, Sally, this is too bad.
Oh, good afternoon, Mrs. Foley.
Do please forgive this invasion.
You know quite well it's your uncle Edwin's birthday.
Well, actually, he's her godfather, but she always calls him uncle, you understand.
And not to leave a message or anything.
But of course I guessed you would be here.
She must be a thorough nuisance.
Now come along. We're simply hours late.
But, Mother, I can't.
You see, this is Mr. Craig, and I'm one of the characters in his dream.
Oh, how do you do? Such fun, charades.
So you do understand, don't you?
And poor Edwin, so terribly sensitive.
Now come along, dear.
Mother, you must listen. You see,
Mr. Craig is going to hit me savagely.
Oh, well, I'm sure he can hit somebody else instead.
Come along, dear. Don't forget, you're dining with us on Tuesday, Mrs. Foley.
That'll teach you to mess about with Mr. Craig's dream, Ma.
Well, really, I don't know what to say.
I am surprised Mr. Craig didn't remember Sally's mother.
She seems to me most memorable.
Now look, Doctor, if Craig had told you she was coming, and exactly what she'd be wearing, and the very words she'd say, you'd still have thought the dream was all baloney.
- Good for you, darling.
- I'm becoming quite alarmed.
By the end of this evening, I shall be just as credulous as any of you.
Mr. Craig, I can only say the more incredulous the doctor becomes, the more I believe you.
Thank you.
Doctor, I had hoped that you'd be able to explain to me a happening which, to put it mildly, has always puzzled me.
I shall try.
It started a few weeks after we'd become engaged.
It was April the 9th, to be exact.
I remember the date because it was Peter's birthday.
You know how difficult it is choosing presents for a man.
They always seem to have everything they want.
- Oh, hello, darling.
- Hello, sweet.
Take it through, will you, though?
- What on earth's that?
- Just a little birthday present.
Put it on the couch, will you?
- What is it, a kite?
- Well, why don't you open it and see?
Right. Suppose you fix us a drink.
You haven't gone and had your portrait painted, have you?
No. I thought you'd like to look at yourself.
Darling, it's a beauty.
- Do you really like it?
- Love it.
Well, it's certainly an improvement on that barbola thing your aunt gave you.
Yes, that is pretty grim.
I always felt as if I was looking a gift horse in the mouth.
This is a honey.
Where did you find it?
Chichester. Very expensive.
Happy birthday, darling.
What sort of journey did you have?
Came by road. Got a lift.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
- Not old faithful?
- The same.
Poor old Guy. What will he do when we get married?
- Hardly the big game shooting type, is he?
- Hardly.
He nearly put us into a ditch coming up trying to avoid a rabbit.
Fellow feeling, obviously.
You be careful. I'm very fond of Guy.
Meaning that it pleases your disgusting feminine vanity to have him on a string.
A Spaniel would do just as well.
But Spaniels don't have nice, comfortable Bentleys, do they?
Perhaps you've got something there.
How's that?
Most professional.
I'm glad to see you're going to be useful about the house.
Handsome couple.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Thought I saw something.
- What sort of something?
- Don't know, quite.
What, a little man about so high in a bowler hat?
- What have you been drinking for lunch?
- One pint of bitter.
You know, I think I've been very generous.
So do I. Nicest present I've ever had.
What should we do tonight?
- Dress up? Spend a lot of money?
- Why not?
- Should have worn our grass skirts.
- Well, we've danced enough, anyway.
Darling, is anything the matter?
No. Why?
I don't know. You seem to have been a bit broody all evening.
A bit limp with the heat, I expect.
- Sure there's nothing the matter?
- No, nothing, really.
That usually means there is something, really. What is it?
- It sounds so damn silly.
- Never mind. Tell me.
Well, you know that mirror you gave me?
You didn't get it at one of those joke shops, by any chance?
No, of course not. Why?
Well, when I was dressing this evening, just as I was tying my tie,
I suddenly realized that the reflection was all wrong.
What do you mean, wrong?
Well, it wasn't my room I was seeing.
It was some other room.
- Darling.
- Well, I told you it sounded silly.
It only lasted for a moment, but I could have sworn I saw it.
Some sort of optical illusion, I suppose.
All done with mirrors, in fact.
The next few weeks we were pretty busy house hunting.
In the end we found quite a pleasant house in Chelsea.
And of course I had all the usual chaos getting ready for the wedding.
I noticed that Peter seemed preoccupied and a bit jumpy and irritable.
But I thought it was just eve-of-wedding nerves.
Anyhow, I was so busy,
I didn't have time to think much about it.
Whew. What a day.
Helen's got measles, blast her, so I'll have to try and find another bridesmaid somewhere.
The cake's under control.
And I've had a lot more answers.
The Laughtons can't come, thank heaven.
And we've got some perfectly frightful presents.
You know, I really think we'll have to turn that spare room of ours into a chamber of horrors.
Which reminds me. When are the men coming to lay the carpets?
- I don't know. I forgot to ring up.
- Really, darling.
Here I am getting fallen arches chasing around, getting things done, and you can't even remember a simple little telephone call.
For heaven's sake, don't nag.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that.
Peter, what's the matter with you?
- You've been edgy for days.
- Yes, I know.
I haven't been sleeping too well.
I really am sorry, darling.
It doesn't matter.
Forget it.
Listen, darling,
I know you fairly well by now.
You're keeping something from me.
What is it?
Well, if you must know, it's that mirror.
You remember me telling you that first evening?
Well, it's got worse. Much worse.
Every time I look in it now,
I see that room.
It's getting me down.
I'd really rather not talk about it.
You'll feel much better if you do.
It's no good bottling things up, you know.
Well... at first, if I made an enormous effort of will, the reflection used to change back to what it ought to be.
But lately, however hard I try, it doesn't change anymore.
The only thing to do is to try not to look in it at all.
But in a queer sort of way it fascinates me.
I feel as if that room, the one in the mirror, were trying to... to claim me... to draw me into it.
It almost becomes the real room... and my own bedroom imaginary.
And I know that there's something waiting for me on the other side of the mirror... something evil, monstrously evil... and that if I cross that dividing line... something awful will happen.
Well, let's get rid of the beastly thing.
You know, you don't have to keep it just because I've given it to you.
I can take it back and they'll change it.
But the trouble's not in the mirror.
It's in my mind.
It must be.
A mirror's just wood and glass.
Peter, I don't know what to say.
Perhaps you're overworked.
Why don't you see a doctor?
I have.
Couldn't find anything wrong with me.
I think I shall have to go and see a mental specialist.
- Nonsense. You're as sane as I am.
- Obviously I can't be.
Listen.
I've been putting off saying this, but I think we ought to postpone the wedding.
That's a bit drastic, isn't it?
I don't know.
Suppose I am going mad.
Wouldn't be much fun for you, would it?
Take you five years to get a divorce.
Really, darling.
You're going a little bit too fast for me.
Let's get the wedding over, and then we can start making divorce arrangements afterwards.
Peter, come with me, will you?
Look in the mirror.
Look in the mirror.
What is it, darling?
It's worse than ever.
- You're not there.
- But of course I'm there.
I tell you, you're not.
In the other room, I'm alone.
Look in the mirror and tell me exactly what you see.
It's just as it always is.
Instead of my bed, there's the other bed.
I can see it quite clearly.
The posts have vine leaves twisted round them with bunches of grapes at the top.
The hangings are dark red silk.
The walls are paneled.
There's a log fire burning in the grate.
It's no use, I tell you. I am going mad.
Now I'll tell you what I see.
No four-poster, no paneling, and no log fires.
Just your ordinary room with you and me in it.
Listen to me.
You're going to look in this mirror again.
You're going to see exactly the same as I do.
Come here. Come here.
- Can you see your own room?
- No.
- Or me?
- No.
But you must.
- Make yourself.
- I can't.
You can, darling, if you try.
- It's no good.
- You can.
Look, here I am, standing by you.
Yes.
Yes, there you are.
I can see you now.
You see? I told you so.
I can't make it out.
Come on, let's get out of here and have a drink.
So that seemed to be that.
And a fortnight later we got married and moved into the new house.
In a way, I'd have been happier to get rid of the mirror.
But Peter seemed to have completely lost his fear of it,
so I decided to let things be.
Mother says can we come down the weekend after next?
It's her birthday.
I'm afraid I shan't be able to make it.
We'll be rushing that big audit through.
Well, never mind. She'll be disappointed, but we can go some other time.
Well, you can go, sweet, anyhow, even if I can't.
- I don't want to go without you.
- I don't want you to.
But your mother would rather have you alone.
You know, getting her precious daughter back for a few days.
Don't be an idiot.
She doesn't feel she's lost a daughter.
She's gained a son.
What a gift for a phrase you have.
Think it over, anyhow.
- Hello?
- Hello, Peter.
Hello, darling. Have a good journey?
Yes. I wish you could've come.
So do I. Still, it can't be helped.
Do you miss me?
Of course I do. Do you miss me?
Yes. Gone to bed yet?
No, I'm going to do another half an hour's work first.
- Well, good night, darling.
- Good night, darling. See you Monday.
- Give my love to your mother.
- Yes. Good night, darling.
Good night, darling.
- Toll number, please.
- Flaxman 6061.
Get me Chichester 2352.
Thank you.
What is it, dear?
Nothing.
Mother, I want to speak to Mr. Rutherford.
Would you go on to the library, then walk back this way?
Very well, dear.
- Good morning, Mr. Rutherford.
- Good morning, Miss Walsh.
I beg your pardon. Mrs. Cortland.
Do you remember that Chippendale mirror
I bought here about three months ago?
Indeed, I do. I hope your husband was satisfied with it.
Yes, very. Tell me.
That bed, the four-poster.
How odd you should mention it.
Why, it so happens I bought it at the same sale that I bought your mirror.
There's a curious history attaching to them both.
- Curious?
- Well, tragic, perhaps I should say.
I trust, by the way, you're not superstitious.
No.
- No, I don't think so.
- Won't you sit down?
Some people retain a positively medieval attitude of mind with regard to these matters.
Please, Mr. Rutherford, will you tell me the story? I'm very interested.
By all means.
The bed and the mirror form part of the contents of the private apartments of a Mr. Francis Etherington, who died at Marsden-Lacey in 1836.
The apartments had remained unused and locked from that time to the sale.
That is his portrait, by the way.
He was a man of dominating character.
Arrogant, reckless, handsome, and often of violent temper.
He married a very beautiful heiress, a Miss Perry.
The couple retired to Marsden-Lacey where they lived contentedly for a time.
Then, suddenly, disaster overtook them.
Out hunting one day,
Etherington was thrown by his horse, which then rolled on him.
His spine was injured, and he was never again able to do more than drag himself a few paces from this bed.
- How dreadful.
- Yes.
Unfortunately, the effects of such constraint on a man of his enormous energy was more than his mind could endure.
He became morose, embittered, suspicious, above all, of his wife.
Quite without reason, he began accusing the poor lady of betraying him with his friends... with strangers, with his servants.
Had she not been so devoted to him, she certainly would have left him.
And indeed, it would have been better for her had she done so.
For one day, in an excess of jealous rage... he strangled her, and then sat down in front of the mirror... your mirror... and cut his throat.
What a horrible story.
And the mirror... hasn't been used again until Peter... until I bought it for my husband.
Precisely.
Peter!
Peter!
Peter, darling!
Oh, there you are.
Something gone wrong with your plans for a weekend?
- Darling, what do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Of course you haven't.
Of course you didn't think
I suspected anything when you were so eager to go away without me.
Well, I'm not a fool.
I knew what your game was.
Darling, stop, please!
- Sit down and listen to me.
- I will not sit down.
I know you'd like to have me chained to this chair as you have me chained to this room.
But I won't stand it, not while I have strength to move at all.
Darling, sit down and listen to me.
You're not well.
And a good thing for you and your precious lover that I'm not.
If I could move out of this room,
I'd break him in pieces.
Peter, it's the mirror.
I found out what's wrong with the mirror.
There's nothing wrong with the mirror.
I look in it often.
I sit here and look at these four walls.
And then for a change,
I look at them in the mirror.
You don't know what you're saying.
This isn't Marsden-Lacey.
Your name isn't Etherington.
It's Cortland, Peter Cortland, and I'm your wife!
Exactly. You're my wife.
But you sometimes choose to forget it.
Well, what's the matter?
Why have you come back?
No, let me guess.
You were enjoying a pleasant weekend with Guy, but he was called away, so you had to come back to me.
Peter, I haven't even seen Guy.
Anyhow, you know we've always treated him as a joke.
Yes, I know we've always pretended to, but I knew what was going on all the time.
Nothing's been going on.
You know that as well as I do.
I pretended not to notice.
Day after day, month after month, while you were making a public laughingstock of me.
But this time I've had enough, and I'm going to punish you as you deserve to be punished.
Peter, it's the mirror.
Mr. Rutherford told me about it.
That's why I came back.
It belonged to a man who was crippled who accused his wife just as you are now accusing me.
Peter, you must listen to me!
Peter. Peter, darling, are you all right?
- I seem to have cut myself.
- Sit down. Let me have a look at it.
Look at the mirror.
How did that happen?
Never mind now, darling.
- But, darling, we could get it mended.
- No, we can't. Look.
It's old and worm-eaten and rotten.
It should have been burned ages ago.
You poor darling.
Well, I should think you could do with a drink after that.
I know I could.
Mother, what did you do with that bottle of schnapps I got for Dr. Van Straaten?
It's in the cupboard in the hall.
Well, how's the great debunker going to debunk that?
Ever since Mr. Craig arrived, you've been asking me to produce scientific explanations like rabbits out of a hat.
I'm not accustomed to solving complex problems with the careless ease of your brains trust.
It sounds to me as though you're completely stumped this time.
Joan saw the room in the mirror as well as Peter.
The witness I couldn't supply you with.
Very well. You asked for it.
This was a case of cryptomnesia.
The transmissibility of an illusion by one person to one or more other persons who are emotionally cohesive is well-established.
Do I make myself clear?
I'm totally at sea.
You wouldn't like to start again, would you, very slowly and in words of one syllable.
Hamlet was right, Doctor.
There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy.
And my recurring dream isn't just a meaningless trick of the mind.
It was sent to me as a warning, a warning against the terror that's waiting for me in this house.
Well, I'm like Grainger.
I'm going to act on the warning.
I'm going to leave here now, this instant.
Craig!
If you go now, you'll be making a profound mistake.
You'll be delivering yourself into the hands of your obsession.
I beg you to stay and see it through.
Whatever happens, if anything happens, the reality can't possibly be as bad as your imagination has painted it.
Why not?
I tell you, Doctor, there's something horrible waiting for me here, perhaps even death itself.
Craig.
An hour ago you asked me to help you.
I think I can.
But only if you want me to, only if you do what I beg you to do.
Whilst every minute brings the horror closer?
No, Doctor. I'm not going to submit my will to yours.
I'm going to leave this place now, before it's too late.
What's your tipple, by the way? Scotch?
No, thanks. I'm going. I can't face it.
I'm sorry, my dear fellow.
However, I don't blame you a bit.
Yes, you do. You despise me.
You think I'm a contemptible coward.
Nothing of the kind, honestly.
Still, I'm sorry because...
Well, whatever's in the wind, a fellow would like to rally round and lend a helping hand and that rot.
- Nobody can help me.
- Tell you what, have one for the road.
- Well...
- Matter of fact, I know just how you feel.
Jolly unpleasant when you come slap up against the supernatural.
I still get a shiver when I think of what happened to a couple of friends of mine.
Ghastly business.
It was when I was staying at my golf club at Windlesham.
The stars of the club were George Parratt and Larry Potter.
Nothing could keep them from their game.
They were both pretty good, and they were deadly rivals,
but only on the links.
In all other respects, they were the best of friends.
Until...
Mary seemed to look on them with equal favor.
And the result, of course,
was complete deadlock.
We can't go on like this, old man.
She's ruining my game.
Mine too.
Every time I take a stroke,
I see her wretched face.
I keep on hearing her tiresome voice just as I'm swinging.
- They'll be raising our handicap soon.
- Yeah.
She must choose one of us.
But there's nothing to choose.
We're both as good as Bobby Jones.
Very nearly.
I wish you were dead, old man.
It would be just as good if you were.
George! I've got it.
- What?
- We'll play for her.
Tomorrow morning, 18 holes.
- Match play.
- The loser to vanish from the scene.
- Forever.
- Put it there, old man.
Of course!
Why didn't we think of it sooner?
It was a terrific game.
They halved the first four holes,
then Parratt sliced his drive and Potter took the lead.
But at the long 13th,
Parratt got a wonderful four.
And after that, it was ding-dong all the way.
Parratt, Potter. Potter, Parratt.
When they reached the last hole, they were square once more.
This hole for Mary Lee.
How many, old man?
Three. And you?
Two.
- Two?
- Yes.
Didn't you see my spoon shot?
Beautiful shot, wasn't it, Smithers?
Oh, a lovely shot, sir.
But nobody's ever reached this green in two before.
I don't believe it's possible.
Well, there it is.
No mistake, is there, Smithers?
No, sir. Quite right, sir.
Only two strokes.
Seems as if I've got my work cut out then.
Jolly good putt, old man.
Well, this is for it.
Well, that's that.
Grand finish to a grand game.
An almost incredible finish.
With Mary in the bag,
Parratt realized it was time
to turn his mind once more to serious things.
He hadn't touched his clubs since the Potter tragedy,
and he needed practice.
I offered to give him a game.
I soon found, to my cost, that he was playing better than ever.
Life obviously seemed very good to him.
And then we reached the lake.
Good morning, George, old man.
Still cheating?
Oh, yes. It's me, all right.
I've returned from my watery grave...
to haunt you.
Cheat!
Cad! Twister! Worm!
Skunk! Rat!
Rabbit.
I'll teach you that crime doesn't pay.
Unconditional surrender, old man.
Those are my terms.
May the Lord have mercy on your handicap.
Ouch!
- I say, Eliot.
- Yes, old man?
Do you believe in ghosts?
Ghosts?
Good lord, no.
Neither do I.
That was only the beginning.
For this poor, stricken shadow of a man,
there was only one relief.
Another whiskey, Fred, a large one.
Make it two.
Good heavens.
I thought you were dead.
So I am, old man, as dead as a stymie.
- Two large whiskeys, Fred.
- You mean a quadruple, sir?
No, no, no.
Separate glasses, of course.
One for him.
Fred can't see me or hear me.
Nobody else can either.
It's only you I'm haunting.
Well, it's time you gave somebody else a turn. I've had it.
Not bad, am I, for a beginner.
George Parratt, handicap 18.
I think it's perfectly despicable.
Not nearly as despicable as cheating at golf.
- You haven't a vestige of proof.
- Yes, I have. It's on the record.
- What record?
- The recording angel's record.
- It shows that you took five for the 18th.
- Five shillings, please, sir.
Recording angel. He can't count.
Listen, now, you're going too far.
It was bad enough out on the links.
Don't expect me to stop there, old man.
All that invisible stuff is very elementary.
Any rabbit could do it.
A ghost must better himself.
Do you mean to say you're going to hang around me for the rest of my life?
I most certainly am.
- Unless, of course, you care to lay me.
- How?
Well, first of all, you must give up Mary.
Give up Mary?
Certainly not.
I'm not going to have a fine young girl like that married to a cheat and a liar.
Yes, I suppose I've got it coming to me.
It'll break my heart, of course.
Listen. If you promise to let me alone,
I'll step out of Mary's life.
Well, that's my first condition.
Second is... you'll have to give up golf.
Give up golf?
- Never.
- Don't you realize what you've done?
You've disgraced this club, besmirched the greatest of all games, dragged the name of Saint Andrew in the dust.
Good heavens, man. You should be drummed out of the Royal and Ancient.
Oh, yes, yes, yes. I'll admit all this.
I'm a cad, a rat, and a worm.
I agree with everything you've called me, but you can't punish me like this.
Listen, Larry, you're a golfer yourself.
You must realize what it means.
I shall have nothing left to live for.
Nothing.
You can't be such a skunk.
Perhaps you're right, old man.
I mustn't lower myself to your level.
Dear old Larry.
I knew you'd see it the right way.
But you've got to break with Mary.
And if I do, you'll never haunt me again?
I'll disappear here and now, forever.
It's a deal.
Well, one for the sky.
No, thanks. I've got a date with Saint Andrew at four o'clock.
Well, good-bye, old boy.
Good luck. I hope you win.
Thanks, George. Good-bye.
What's the matter?
I've got the passes wrong.
Better try again.
- George?
- Yes?
I've forgotten how to vanish.
Look here, old man.
This is shocking.
I can get as far as this.
- Then I can't remember what I do next.
- You must remember.
Don't forget you've been well and truly laid.
I know I've got to hold my breath and do this.
- Then I get stuck.
- Well, what about that?
No good? Well, try this.
No good, no good.
- I am sorry.
- Well, it is a bit thick.
A ghost shouldn't be allowed to go haunting until he's properly qualified.
It's all my fault, I'm afraid.
I should have spent longer on the materialization course.
But you would insist on getting married on Saturday.
And I still intend to get married on Saturday.
But you promised.
Well, if you can't keep your side of the bargain, why should you expect me to keep mine?
I see your point.
- You realize what it will mean, though.
- What?
Well, I shall have to stick to you... everywhere.
- Everywhere?
- Yes.
Always remain within six foot of you.
That's the official ruling.
Because a chap becomes a ghost, it surely doesn't mean that he ceases to be a gentleman.
Don't worry, old chap.
It's sure to come back to me before Saturday.
It was unbelievable.
I was on the green in two, down in three.
That's how I collected that one.
- Well, fancy that.
- Now then, this is the Walkerbath Cup.
- Yes, dear?
- Yes.
I beat poor old Larry Potter seven and five.
Two and one.
Flukiest game you ever played.
Seven and five.
I beg your pardon.
Now, this one. This is a long story.
Yes, darling, you can tell me all about that tomorrow.
Kiss me.
- George!
- Yes, my pet?
You haven't give me one real kiss since we left the church.
Yes, I know, darling, I know.
We've been very busy.
Get on with it.
Get on with it, you mug.
That's what you're here for.
Well, we're not busy now, are we?
Gracious, 10:00 already?
Is it, darling? I didn't count.
Well, I think I'll be turning in, darling.
Yes. I think I'll turn in too.
I'm feeling rather tired.
Well, so am I.
- Six feet, old man.
- Six feet!
I don't wonder.
I'll just go and count the cups.
- Count the cups?
- Yes, darling, count the cups.
I always count the cups before I go to bed.
Look here. This is intolerable.
Yes, I quite agree. But what can I do?
Everything's failed.
Have another go.
Try as you've never tried before.
All right, for what it's worth.
Shut your eyes.
It'll help you to concentrate.
Okay, here goes.
Of all the caddish tricks!
I can't think what's come over you.
It's entirely your fault.
You can't cheat a ghost.
What the devil are we going to do now?
I shall have to go on trying, that's all.
Yes, but don't you see, you blithering idiot?
There may be millions of other combinations, and all you can do is this.
What comes next?
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
Good heavens, he's gone.
And I wasn't looking.
What's gonna happen now?
Darling?
Oh, darling.
Do I make passes?
Or do I make passes?
Really, Eliot, that story is totally incredible and decidedly improper.
Sorry, I had to tell it. I couldn't bear to be left out in the cold.
That wasn't why you told the story.
You did it to try and help me, didn't you?
You succeeded where I failed, Eliot, and in a double sense.
Craig, you said that the horror started when Eliot told about the death of a man you'd never heard of.
- Didn't you?
- That's right.
Well...
Eliot just described how his friend Potter committed suicide.
You'd never heard of Potter before, had you?
No. No, I hadn't.
Yet the horror hasn't started, has it?
No, it hasn't.
There you are. You see?
I'm so glad.
The spell has been broken at last.
Now I can go and see about dinner with an easy mind.
I'll lend a hand, if I may.
Thank you, my dear.
That's very kind of you.
Mr. Craig, now that you've met us,
I'm sure you wouldn't dream of dreaming about us again.
Come along, my dear.
Apart from my bit of nonsense, the curious thing is that all of you, even Sally, seems to have had one of these extraordinary experiences.
Perhaps they aren't so extraordinary.
Perhaps they happen to most people.
Oh. You mean there's a ghost as well as a skeleton in everyone's cupboard.
That's a pretty thought.
And what's the ghost in your cupboard, Doctor?
Well... there was one occasion in my professional career that made me wonder.
Made me wonder quite a lot.
You may remember the case.
Maxwell Frere, the ventriloquist,
was charged with the attempted murder of a man in the same line of business,
Sylvester Kee, an American.
My friend Maurice Olcott, who was defending the case,
wanted my opinion on the state of his mind.
Oh, Frere.
This is Dr. Van Straaten.
He's gonna help us with the case.
How do you do, Mr. Frere?
I had the pleasure of seeing your performance last year at The Hague.
- It was most...
- A doctor, eh?
- A brain specialist?
- Psychiatrist.
I thought as much.
You want to psychoanalyze me, don't you?
You want to look inside my brain and see how the wheels go round.
- Now, wait a moment, Frere...
- Dissect me like a guinea pig.
Then show me off to your distinguished colleagues as an interesting case.
- Well, that's it, isn't it?
- Hardly.
But it's possible that I may be able to help you if you are prepared to help me.
Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You're wasting your time, Doctor.
I'm not mad.
I don't want your help, or yours either.
- Hugo's the only one can help me.
- The dummy?
Yes, the police are holding it as evidence.
Hugo should be here with me.
You see... he's more to blame for all this than I am.
What exactly do you mean by that?
Yes, you'd like to know, wouldn't you?
Well, get Hugo back and perhaps you will.
Perhaps you'll have a case history that'll make your complexes stand on end.
Then you can write a big, fat book all about it, eh?
Does that tempt you, Doctor?
Very well, then. Get Hugo back!
Now you see what I'm up against.
Very interesting.
I'd like to have a talk with that other fellow... Kee.
I'm afraid that's out of the question.
He's a witness for the prosecution.
Have a look at his statement.
I'd like to know what you think of it.
Seems more like your job than mine.
I knew Maxwell Frere by reputation as an artiste of the highest standing
in his and my profession.
I first made his acquaintance about a year ago,
when he was performing at the Chez Beulah Nightclub in Paris.
Ladies and gentlemen, is there a Frenchman in the house?
I'm told one or two can be seen in Paris lately.
- Sylvester Kee!
- Why, hello, Beulah.
Boy, I haven't seen you for years.
Where have you been?
Oh, back in the States.
I just hit town.
Well, how's business?
Mighty fine, honey child. Mighty fine.
You old warhorse. You look terrific.
Just like the lights of Broadway on a dark night.
Say, Beulah.
This guy Frere, they tell me he's pretty good.
I'll say he is.
Yeah, well, what's he got that I haven't got?
His dummy.
- Don't say you haven't seen him.
- No.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Come on, let's go in.
If we had to do this routine in the Colosseum, the act would be in ruins.
Colosseum! Ruins!
I kill myself sometimes.
Hey, Maxwell.
Not this one. Not this one!
Well, don't be shy, Hugo.
The lady won't bite you.
No, but you know me.
I might bite the lady.
Tell me, my little lotus blossom, where have I been all your life?
Uh-oh, one of the natives.
Didn't I see you working your head off in the Folies Bergère?
I'm sure I saw her in the Folies Bergère.
The lady's face is familiar, is it?
What would I be doing in the Folies Bergère looking at faces?
Hey, Maxwell.
We don't have to wake these two up.
Besides, I can read her thoughts.
Read her thoughts?
Why, Hugo, that's clairvoyance.
Clairvoyance?
Good evening, Claire.
Maxwell, we must be a riot.
The first of tomorrow night's audience just came in.
See who I mean? The dumb-looking one.
Why, Hugo.
He doesn't look any more dumb than I do.
Don't ask the impossible.
Hello, stranger.
One of our American friends.
Strong, speechless type.
Well, Mr. Dumb Cluck, are you as dumb as you look, or do you cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck?
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Hey, did you mislay that egg?
Why, no, Hugo. I didn't do a thing.
But will someone please tell me what's going on around here?
Hugo, I think we better be moving along.
He's a ventriloquist.
He doesn't look like a trick cyclist.
No, no. I said "ventriloquist."
What, you mean the chap who makes a voice come out of a stuffed dummy, the way I do out of you?
That's about it.
Well, well, well.
- Is it true, what he said?
- I guess so.
You interest me, my man.
You interest me quite a lot.
We too could make beautiful music together.
That's fine, Hugo, but... how about making a little music with Frank, eh? Frank!
Maxwell, I don't think
I feel like singing.
Come, come, Hugo.
Mustn't disappoint your public.
Just a bird in a gilded cage, that's me.
Oh, to hell with it.
Oh, come on, now. You ready?
- One, two, three.
- Four, five, six.
Let's sit this one out, shall we?
Hugo, everybody's waiting.
My, my. So they are.
Tell you what. You be the canary tonight.
I'm going to talk to the ventriloquist man.
Mind if I join you?
Sure. Come on over.
Come on, sourpuss.
Sit down.
Now, either of you gentlemen care for a glass of champagne?
What do you think I am, a battleship?
Do you know something? I like you.
- What's your name?
- The name is Kee. Sylvester Kee.
Sylvester, you may call me Hugo.
Oh, thanks, Hugo.
- That is my assistant.
- Glad to know you, Mr. Frere.
A very uncouth character, I'm afraid.
I say, Sylvester.
How'd you like to work with me?
I'd like it fine, Hugo.
- But...
- But what?
Well, how about Mr. Frere here?
You're sort of teamed up with him, aren't you?
Him?
My good man, think nothing of it.
I'm just about through with that cheap ham, anyway.
Temper, temper.
You'll be sorry for this later, you know.
Yes, I suppose I will.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Hugo and I are old friends.
Dear old pals, jolly old pals
Exactly. But every now and then we have our little disagreements.
You certainly disagree with me.
Would you believe that this guy thinks he carries the act.
Well, in one way, maybe he does.
- Come, come, Hugo. We must be going.
- Sure, sure.
But there won't be much room in the dressing room.
Not much room in the dressing room?
Why not?
I told the waiter to bring up a couple of sidecars, and the fool brought the motorcycles as well.
Sidecars! Motorcycles!
Well, good night, ladies and gentlemen.
Say good night, Hugo.
Good night, sleep tight, wake up sober.
Hey, Sylvester.
- "The Hullalooba."
- Sylvester.
I'll be waiting for you in my dressing room.
You and I have got to talk business.
In far lands
Where hazy mountains never end
Which is the way to
Maxwell Frere's dressing room?
- That door, monsieur.
- Thank you.
The hulla, hulla, hullalooba
Dreamy tune
The boys are riding
And they croon
Love comes on like a falling star
It's hulla, hulla, hullalooba
Saddle your horse
And hullalooba, looba
Come across
The hullalooba, looba way
And sing
In hullalooba, looba swing
- Who is it?
- It's Sylvester Kee.
Come in.
Glad to see you, Sylvester.
Mix yourself a drink, and let's get down to business, eh?
Well, thanks, brother. I will.
But suppose you tell me where I can find Mr. Frere.
I guess he can't be very far away.
So, you won't talk, eh?
Did you want to see me?
Well...
I rather thought I had an invite from our young friend here.
After all, Mr. Frere,
I'm a ventriloquist myself, you know.
Hell, I'm soaking.
- There's a clean towel in here.
- Thanks.
Sorry, but I can't bear anyone touching him.
That's all right. Forget it.
Say, I sure liked it how you pulled that gag.
What gag?
- I don't quite...
- Just now, before you came in.
You know, for a moment, I could have sworn it was the dummy speaking.
And me a pro.
- What did he say?
- Don't let's start that all over again.
- Was it about you and him?
- Why, yes.
But you know that.
You wouldn't...
You wouldn't ever do that, would you?
Do what?
- I don't get you.
- Do what he was asking.
Say, are you nuts or something?
How in heck could I team up with Hugo?
He's yours, isn't he?
Yes, that's right. He's... He's mine.
What kind of a heel do you think I am that I'd try to steal another guy's act?
Now, please don't misunderstand me.
I don't distrust you.
It's just that you don't know what Hugo is capable of.
I don't know about that.
I've had a pretty good demonstration.
Say, who runs this act, anyway?
This fellow is almost human.
- Did you say almost?
- That's right.
As if you got a mind of your own.
Maxwell, this fellow's as stupid as you are.
Perhaps I'd better explain the position.
No. No. No.
Kee, if you don't mind, I'm rather tired.
Why, sure. I understand.
Ignore him, Sylvester.
Just ignore him.
I'm the one who gives orders around here. He's only...
- Hugo, please.
- Pipe down, you.
- Listen, my friend.
- No, no!
Say, what kind of a routine is this, anyway?
Go away, will you?
Leave us alone.
Go away. Get out of here.
Okay, okay.
I'm going.
You ought to get your head examined.
Good night.
Kee, my friend. Don't leave me.
Take me with you. Maxwell, let go of me!
Kee, get me out of here. Kee! Kee!
Kee!
Hey, that guy in there's nuts, huh?
But nuts!
Let go your rein
Ride for adventure once again
Let go your heart
And, oh, Mama
Sing hullalooba
After what happened in the dressing room,
I was sure he was not quite right in the head.
I did not see Frere again until the night of February the 2nd.
I had just arrived in London
and was staying at the Imperial Palace Hotel.
Shortly before 11:00 p.m.
I entered the hotel bar.
Frere was sitting at the bar.
Hello, there! How have you been?
Hello.
Say, I met Joe Green just now.
- He's mighty sore at you.
- I expect he is.
- We walked out of his show.
- Oh? How come?
He didn't like it.
And I don't want to talk about it.
Jack. Same again.
Okay by me, brother.
Give me a scotch, please.
Come on, you two.
We only got five minutes.
Evening, Jack.
What are you gonna have, girls?
- Whiskey sour.
- Me too.
- Three whiskey sours, Jack.
- Oh, look.
There's Maxwell Frere, the ventriloquist.
I've never seen him.
- Is that his dummy?
- Yes.
Hugo Fitch. Isn't it quaint?
Oh, I'd just love to pick him up.
You can't, Mitzi. The man's plastered.
You know very well I mean the dummy.
You're awful.
Well, go ahead, then. Why don't you?
Go on, Mitzi. I dare you.
Go on, don't be shy.
- Go on.
- Very well, then.
Oh, Mr. Frere, I hoped you wouldn't mind, but he looks so cute.
On your way, sister. On your way.
Aren't you a little devil.
Come along now.
Take your hands off me, will you, or I'll punch your messy little face in.
Say, Maxwell. This cheap bit of skirt's getting after me.
You low, filthy drunk, you. I'll...
- Did you hear what this man called me?
- Skip it. Have a drink.
Harry Parker, are you going to stand by and let this creature insult me?
All right.
Look here, old man, you better apologize to this lady.
- What did you say?
- I said you've insulted this lady.
And I said you better apologize to her.
I assure you, I... haven't the slightest intention.
Lady? What lady.
Maxwell, I don't see no lady.
Look here, are you going to apologize like a gentleman, or do I have to make you?
Who does this guy think he is? Will you kick his teeth in, Maxwell, or shall I?
You asked for it.
Now then, gentlemen.
No fighting in here, please.
Cut it out.
Cut it out. The guy's stinking.
- Well, what's it got to do with you?
- I said cut it out.
- Go on, scram.
- All right, no need to get tough about it.
- You all right, Frere?
- Hugo.
Come on, girls.
Drink up and let's get out of here.
- Come on, please. It's past time.
- All right, all right.
Here he is. There you go.
Well, it's my old friend Sylvester.
- That's better.
- Good night, Jack.
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Just one of those things.
- Are you staying in the hotel?
- Room 791.
- We're all right.
- Sure you are, sure you are.
I'm just going up to my room, and I'll see you home. 791.
I tell you, it can't go on much longer.
He's doing it deliberately.
All this business with Joe Green.
- He's trying to ruin me.
- Joe wouldn't do a thing like that.
- He's sore, but...
- Joe?
You thought I meant...
That's good.
That's really funny.
No, I didn't mean Joe.
I don't get it.
Don't you? No, I suppose you wouldn't.
You just think I'm drunk, don't you?
Well, you're not acting like you're on the water wagon.
Smug, aren't you?
Well, you'd drink too, if you were in my shoes.
I tell you... it's enough to drive a man mad.
Why don't you grab yourself some sleep?
What do you care whether I sleep or not?
Well...
I'm not such a fool as you think,
Sylvester Kee.
I remember what happened in Paris.
I know what you're after.
- You won't get away with it.
- You're crazy.
Get out of this room.
Go on! Get out of this hotel before I send for management, have you thrown out.
Now take it easy, pal.
It happens that I'm living in the hotel.
- Thrown out!
- Take it easy, take it easy.
You think you're mighty clever, don't you?
I'll get even with you.
I'll be ready for you.
Won't get away with it.
Young fellow, if my pal Fancy Pants got me down the way you do your boss, well, I guess I'd wanna be rid of him.
Okay, okay.
Where is he?
Where's who? What are you talking about?
Where is he? You've stolen him.
If you're talking about the dummy,
I left him on your bed.
Now will you please go away and let me sleep.
He's here.
I know he's here.
Hey, will you get the hell out of here, or do I have to throw you out?
No, no!
Wait!
Dirty, thieving swine.
You dirty, thieving swine!
What do you think of it?
Well, before I commit myself,
I must talk to Frere again.
You think you'll be able to get anything out of him?
- That, my friend, depends on you.
- On me?
On your powers of persuasion with the police, I should say.
As a matter of fact, I don't expect to get what I want from Maxwell Frere.
Well, who do you expect to get it from?
If I am on the right lines, from Hugo Fitch.
Hugo Fitch?
I knew you wouldn't leave me, Hugo.
I knew you'd come back.
Not for long, my boy. Not for long.
You're going to stop in jail for years and years and years and years.
That wouldn't suit me.
But you'll tell them the truth.
You'll tell them it wasn't my fault.
What sort of dummy do you think I am?
You shot him, didn't you?
Yes, but that was in self-defense.
- He was trying to rob me.
- Tell that to the judge.
Poor Sylvester. Such a charming fellow.
They tell me he's recovering.
Be out of hospital soon.
And what's that to you?
Well, looks like
I'll be needing a new partner.
Hugo.
You don't mean that. You're joking.
Like hell I am.
I have my career to think of.
You wouldn't run out on me now.
I don't believe it.
You wouldn't do that to me.
Oh, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't I?
Wouldn't I?
Hugo, I wouldn't let you.
Can't stop me, Maxwell.
You're finished.
Finished.
What if I tell them the truth?
Suppose I tell them you made me do it.
Try it and see what happens.
They'll put you in the madhouse.
But not little Hugo. Oh, no.
I'm going to team up with Sylvester.
Maybe we'll come and visit you.
You know, private show for the loony.
Oh, Maxwell, now don't get excited.
I was only joking.
You know me.
Maxwell. Maxwell!
Maxwell! Take your hands off me!
- Stop, Frere!
- Maxwell!
Frere, you fool!
Officer, quickly! Open this door!
Quickly.
Quick!
I hope we're doing the right thing.
You know what happened the last time we met.
Maybe he won't feel so good seeing me again.
It's our responsibility, Mr. Kee.
- He's in here.
- Just a minute, Doc.
I guess I got the jitters.
It'll give him a hell of a jolt, won't it?
That's just it.
He needs a jolt to set his brain working again.
You're the jolt.
Of course it's risky, but it's our only hope.
- Well, I...
- We are ready to chance it if you are.
Okay.
- You're the doctors.
- Thanks.
He's been like that all the time.
Frere... there's someone to see you.
Hello, there. How you keeping?
Say, you remember me.
The name is Kee. Sylvester Kee.
Why, hello, Sylvester.
I've been waiting for you.
I've been waiting for you.
He's still there.
One of the most complete examples of dual identity in the history of medical science.
You mean that half the time
Frere was Frere, and the other half he was his dummy?
Exactly.
And in the end, the dummy got the upper hand entirely.
Yes, but how did the dummy get from one room to another?
Under its own steam?
Without knowing what he was doing,
Frere took it himself... impelled by the dominating
Hugo half of his mind.
That is the scientific explanation.
But no doubt you people would prefer a more colorful one, that Hugo had become endowed with an existence of his own.
Drink?
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
Blimey, Georgie's dying on us.
It's... started.
It's all right. Nothing's started.
No one's dying.
George isn't a man.
It's the Foleys' power plant.
They make their own electricity.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're your friends.
We want to help you.
None of you can help me.
I must be left alone with Dr. Van Straaten.
Please.
Perhaps that's best.
And, Grainger, would you be kind enough to fetch my spare glasses from my room?
- I'm lost without them.
- Yes, okay, Doctor.
And now, Craig...
I accept your dream.
Now my task is to listen and yours to talk.
Just let your thoughts run on.
Speak them aloud.
Say everything that is in your mind.
If only I'd left here when I wanted to... when I still had a will of my own.
You tried to stop me.
You wouldn't have done it if you'd known.
You have not told me yet what it is that you are compelled to do, Craig.
To kill someone... someone who's never done me any harm... and wishes me nothing but good.
A man without defense... because he is lost in the dark.
Oh, Doctor.
Why did you have to break your glasses?
I've got to hide, to hide...
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
- Let's play another game!
- Yes! Hide-and-seek.
- Who's to hide?
- I'll hide! I'll hide!
Yes, Mr. Craig will hide!
Mr. Craig will hide!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11...
- Peter!
- Has something gone wrong with your plans?
Please, Peter. Let me hide in the room in the mirror.
Room in the mirror?
I've got him, I've got...
Here he is!
Here he is, up in the lumber room!
Take a seat, sucker.
- What's biting you, sucker?
- He looks kind of sick to me, Hugo.
- Well, why don't you see a doctor?
- Maybe he has seen a doctor.
My, my, Hugo. We've never played to a murderer before, have we?
Why, no, Kee.
Is there a policeman in the house?
Just room for one more inside, sir.
No! No! No! No!
Wouldn't I?
Darling, whatever's the matter?
- Another nightmare.
- You poor sweet.
Hello?
Just a minute. Darling.
Walter Craig speaking.
Darling, you're on my feet.
Bill put you on to me?
That's fine.
What name is it?
Eliot Foley.
F-O-L-E-Y.
Yes, and the place is Pilgrim's Farm.
- Right.
- Who was it?
Friend of Bill's.
Wants me to go down for the weekend.
A reconstruction job.
An old farmhouse in Kent.
Eliot Foley.
Pilgrim's Farm.
I wonder why that sounds so familiar.
A weekend in the country? I should go.
I'll toss for it.
Heads I go, tails I don't.
- Heads.
- I go.
That's just what you need, darling.
It'll help you get rid of those horrible nightmares.
There's a curse upon this village... the curse of Frankenstein.
Aye.
Aye, it is true.
The whole countryside shuns the village.
Our fields are barren, the inn is empty.
My little ones cry in their sleep.
They are hungry. There is no bread.
It's the curse, the curse of Frankenstein.
This is nonsense, folks.
You talk as though these were the Dark Ages.
You know as well as I do... that the monster died in the sulphur pit under Frankenstein's tower... and that Ygor, his familiar... was riddled with bullets from the gun of Baron Frankenstein himself.
But Ygor does not die that easily.
They hanged him and broke his neck, but he lives.
Haven't I seen him, sitting beside the hardened sulphur pit... playing his weird horn, as if to lure the monster... back from death to do his evil bidding.
You talk like frightened children.
Well, if something isn't done... there'll be a new mayor after the fall election.
Aye!
- What do you want me to do?
- Destroy the castle.
Wipe the last traces of these accursed Frankensteins from our land.
- The people are right, Your Honour.
- I agree, Your Honour.
I don't believe that these dead wretches can affect the prosperity of this village.
But do as you will with the castle.
It's yours.
We'll blow it up!
Look! Old Ygor!
I told you he was alive.
All the more reason to blow up the castle.
Die, you fiend! You swine!
My friend!
They didn't kill you!
You lived through the pit, the sulphur pit!
Sulphur was good for you, wasn't it?
It preserved you.
We have to hurry. Hurry.
Come. I help you, my friend.
Come, my friend.
Now you live forever. They can't destroy you.
Come. We go away.
We have to hurry.
They dynamite the castle.
They're too late. We fooled them.
Come. We go to the country.
A better country than this.
No!
Come back!
No!
The lightning.
It is good for you.
Your father was Frankenstein.
But your mother was the lightning.
She has come down to you again.
We will go to Ludwig, the second son of Frankenstein.
He has all the secrets of his father, who created you.
We will force him to harness the lightning for you.
It will give you strength, strength of a hundred men.
Come.
We are going to find Dr. Frankenstein.
There you are, gentlemen.
The usual post-surgical treatment.
Think of it.
The first time the human brain has been removed from the skull... subjected to surgery, and then replaced.
With success, we hope.
After all, Dr. Frankenstein, we have to remember... the patient was violently dementia praecox.
Medical science has advanced a great deal... since you made your experiment, Dr. Bohmer.
It's unfortunate that it had such tragic consequences.
But you blazed the trail.
It was you who pointed the way.
If you should want me, gentlemen,
I shall be in my library completing my notes.
- How's the patient, Dr. Kettering?
- All indications excellent.
Respiration, pulse, everything.
- Wonderful, wasn't it?
- Yes.
Wonderful.
A bit belated, perhaps, but wonderful nevertheless.
Why live always in the past, Dr. Bohmer?
You've allowed that one mistake of yours to embitter your whole life.
Mistake? No.
Just a slight miscalculation, that's all.
But my experiment was a success.
In those days...
I was the master.
Frankenstein was just the pupil.
But I made a slight miscalculation.
Please, what is the name of this village?
- Vasaria.
- Pretty place.
Is there a doctor named Frankenstein...
Ludwig Frankenstein in the village?
You mean the one who heals those who are sick in mind?
Yes. That's the one I mean.
- Do you know the doctor?
- Very well.
I know his father and his brother, too.
He lives in a chateau at the end of the village.
- A large house with a high wall.
- Yes. Thank you.
I'll show her how to boot it.
Look at your ball up there.
- How do you like that?
- All the way up on the roof.
Hello.
Are you a giant?
Can you get my ball?
Way up there.
- Isn't that your child, Hussman?
- Yes!
No!
Don't do that. Do you want to kill my child?
Cloestine, ask your friend to bring you down, dear.
Ask your friend to bring you down.
Please take me down to Daddy.
Tell him no one will hurt him.
Take me down.
My daddy says no one will hurt you.
- Get him!
- No! You promised not to hurt him.
- Where are you going, Erik?
- Hello, Elsa. I didn't see you.
What are you doing driving around the countryside... in the middle of the day?
Town prosecutor should be in his office, working.
Sometimes my work takes me out of my office.
- I came to see your father.
- That's pretty.
I flattered myself that you came way out here to take me for a drive.
I wish that were the case, darling.
Nothing could make me happier.
But this is a very serious matter.
I must see your father.
Since you put it that way,
I'll have to find him.
Come in.
- Father, you have a visitor.
- And a very welcome one, too.
Delighted to see you, Erik. How are you?
You look worried.
Elsa been treating you badly?
No, not at all, sir.
Be patient. Wait till you're married.
Doctor, we have a madman in jail.
I'd like you to examine him and advise us.
Well, I have some work to do, but I'll come later.
But this is urgent.
He's already killed two villagers.
We have him chained but if he breaks loose, he can tear down the building.
- That's rather an exaggeration, isn't it?
- No, indeed, sir.
He's huge, a monster.
I've never seen anything like him.
Very well, Erik.
As soon as I finish my work, I'll come down.
Thank you, sir. I'll be expecting you.
Come.
There's a man in the waiting room to see you, Doctor. He says it's very urgent.
He comes from the village of Frankenstein.
Very well, I'll see him.
Martha...
I'd rather my daughter didn't know about this visitor.
Certainly, sir.
How does it feel to face a man you thought your brother killed, Doctor?
- What do you want?
- The monster is with me.
He's the one in the police station.
But he won't be there long.
You will bring him here.
- The law must take its course.
- Law! What can the law do to him?
Do you think they can keep him in jail?
He is more dangerous today than he ever was before.
Besides his sick brain, he has a sick body.
You can make him well, Frankenstein.
How? What can I do?
You can harness the lightning, as your father did.
Pour life into his hungry veins.
Give him back the strength he once had.
Will you do it, Frankenstein?
Ever since the day my father put life into that creature, it has been a curse.
The terrible consequences of his creation killed my father... and drove my brother into exile.
The monster shall not ruin my life.
I'm happy here.
I have a lovely daughter, friends.
They know nothing of all this.
You wouldn't like to spoil that, Doctor, would you?
You wouldn't want me to tell them... that you are the son of the Frankenstein that created him... that your brother made the thing live... after it had been dead for years.
Do you want me to tell them, Frankenstein?
No.
All right.
Then you'll make the police to hand him over to you.
Yes.
I could do that.
And you will do it, Frankenstein.
Very well.
Now get out!
Father, who was that strange man I saw leaving the house?
Nobody of any consequence, darling.
A patient.
He smiled at me.
A cruel smile.
It was dreadful.
Well, you know what my patients are.
Don't let it worry you.
Now come along, my dear.
I must be getting down to the village.
Order! Order, please!
I've read the report on the nameless prisoner.
I don't understand the urgency that requires an immediate hearing.
This is an unusual case, sir.
The prisoner's dangerous.
It'd be wise to remand him to the higher court... and transfer him to the city soon.
I understand the man is insane.
There's no doubt of it.
But that's for the higher court to determine.
We should make a report on the prisoner's mental condition.
Dr. Frankenstein will be here shortly to examine him.
Very well.
The prosecutor may proceed.
What is your name?
Where are you from?
Who brought you to Vasaria?
You see, Your Honour?
This mad beast cannot even talk.
I recommend that you order him remanded to the higher court without further delay.
I understand the little Hussman girl has a certain influence over the prisoner.
Perhaps if she talked to him, we might learn his identity.
Your Honour, I protest.
We've had one harrowing experience with this...
He did her no harm.
And some attempt must be made to establish his identity.
I can't allow my child to take this chance.
We don't know what he might do.
He was promised he'd not be harmed, and he's been beaten half to death.
What's your name?
Where do you live?
Won't you tell us?
All this can serve no purpose, Your Honour.
Dr. Frankenstein is here.
Let him examine the prisoner now.
He seems to recognise you, Dr. Frankenstein.
I never saw this man before in my life.
I know nothing about him.
Come.
Quickly.
Get in here.
Father!
- The monster, it's here. I've seen it.
- Nonsense.
He was standing outside the window, staring at...
Your nerves are on edge. It's the storm.
No, it's here, I tell you.
That other creature was with him. That Ygor.
Frankenstein!
No!
No. Come away.
Come away with me.
Nobody will know who did it.
Come. Come with me.
- Father, who is it?
- Dr. Kettering.
Elsa, go back!
Come away.
Come with me. Come.
Bohmer? Dr. Bohmer!
- What is it, Doctor?
- Give me a hand.
Father.
The monster?
Don't be afraid, darling.
You're quite safe now.
He's powerless for the time being.
Forgive me, Elsa, but I had to expose you to the soporific gas... in order to subdue the others.
You do understand, don't you, dear?
Yes, but I'm afraid.
Send for Erik and the police.
The police can do nothing.
They put him in jail yesterday, but he escaped.
And Dr. Kettering?
I tried to save him, but it was impossible.
He's dead.
- Murdered?
- Yes.
Ever since I can remember,
I have dreaded this moment.
For years I felt secure, certain that the monster had been destroyed.
I tried to keep all knowledge of it from you.
And until last night, I succeeded.
I had to know.
Yesterday, when I saw Ygor...
I felt that something had come out of the past to threaten our happiness.
Please don't let it spoil our lives.
- Father, promise me.
- I promise you, Elsa.
I'll find a way.
I must find a way.
Dr. Bohmer, I need your aid.
This monster must be destroyed.
Destroyed? But how?
He's not subject to the ordinary laws of life.
There is a way.
He was made limb by limb, organ by organ.
He must be unmade in the same way.
Dissection?
Bit by bit, piece by piece... just as my father created it.
But this thing lives. It would be murder.
How can you call the removal of a thing that is not human murder?
I regret, Doctor...
I cannot be part of your plan.
Then I must do it alone.
While it lives, no one is safe.
My son.
What are you about to do?
Would you destroy... that which I, your father, dedicated his life to creating?
I must.
The monster you created is in itself destruction.
Nevertheless, I was near to solving a problem... that has baffled man since the beginning of time... the secret of life, artificially created.
But it has brought death to everything that it's touched.
That is because, unknowingly...
I gave it a criminal brain.
With your knowledge of science, you can cure that.
It's beyond my cure.
It's a malignant brain.
What if it had another brain?
Another brain!
Bohmer! Dr. Bohmer!
What is it, Doctor? You've changed your mind?
Yes. Attach the high-frequency leads to the terminal electrodes.
- Yes, sir.
- Frankenstein!
Come in, Ygor. I may need your assistance.
You have agreed.
You are going to help him, Doctor?
You are giving him life.
Yes, but not for the purpose that you think, Ygor.
I'm giving him strength so that an operation may be successful.
An operation?
Yes, I'm giving him another brain.
You must explain to him when he becomes conscious.
You must make him understand.
Whose brain?
- Kettering?
- Yes, Kettering.
A man of character and learning.
The monster will cease to be an evil influence... and become everything that is good.
No!
You cannot take my friend away from me.
He's all that I have, nothing else.
You're going to make him your friend, and I will be alone.
It will be as I say, or he must be destroyed.
He cannot be destroyed.
There is one way.
- By dissection.
- No.
Not that. Doctor.
Ygor's body's no good.
His neck is broken, crippled and distorted... lame and sick from the bullets your brother fired into me.
You can put my brain in his body.
Your brain?
You can make us one.
We'll be together always... my brain and his body... together.
You're a cunning fellow, Ygor.
Do you think that I'd put your sly and sinister brain into the body of a giant?
That would be a monster indeed.
You'll do as I tell you, or I'll not be responsible for the consequences.
Ironic, isn't it, Doctor?
Yes, the monster's victim shall inherit his body.
And everlasting life.
Build up the voltage potential to its maximum.
It all seems so weird and ghastly.
- I can't stand it any longer, I tell you...
- Elsa.
And you, Father, something's happened to you.
It seems as if a great cloud has come over you.
You don't seem like my father at all.
You must trust me, my dear.
You must realise my problem.
One thing I can assure you.
The monster will never trouble anyone again.
Good morning.
I was wondering, Doctor, when you plan to operate.
At once.
Tonight, if possible.
- I should like to see the patient immediately.
- Yes, Doctor.
A new brain. You understand?
A new brain. New brain!
- Does he understand?
- Yes.
- Is he willing?
- Can't you see?
He is the first time happy in his life.
Good. Take good care of him today.
I shall operate tonight.
All right.
No. Not now. Tonight.
So you're going to let Frankenstein do this operation... to put the brain of his friend into our friend.
- Our friend?
- Yeah.
You, the great Dr. Bohmer... who taught Frankenstein everything he knows.
How would you like to be the leader of your profession in this state?
The head of the medical commission?
The regent of the university?
You weave a pretty fairy tale, crooked neck.
How could that be accomplished?
You will see to it... that the brain of Kettering does not go into the head of the monster.
But why?
My brain will go into it.
- You fool, you'd die.
- Die! I will live again.
Only this crooked body will die.
I will live forever.
My brain in that body would make me a leader of men.
We would rule the state... and even the whole country.
You'll do as I say... and you will have everything you want.
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Erik.
- Good evening.
We're awfully sorry to disturb you.
We've called regarding the escaped maniac.
- Well?
- The countryside's been combed.
Every barn and haystack's been searched... and the neighbouring villages have been notified.
But he and his companion have disappeared completely.
It seems that you've done all that is possible.
A creature like that couldn't pass long unnoticed.
Obviously someone's offering him refuge.
What are you trying to insinuate, Erik?
Perhaps you would care to search the estate.
I warn you, if you contemplate such presumption... you will not be welcome here in the future as my guest.
That won't be necessary.
If you'll permit me to have a few words with Dr. Kettering...
Unfortunately, Dr. Kettering has had to leave suddenly... owing to illness in his family.
He was here yesterday evening. I saw him.
Quite so. He left early this morning.
You were at the station to watch the morning train?
Dr. Kettering was not on the morning train.
I'll have to risk your displeasure, Doctor.
We will search the premises.
Very well.
This is my laboratory, gentlemen.
Inspect the walls and flooring for secret passageways.
Very good.
Mr. Ernst.
Will you guide us, Doctor?
I believe that leads to an old dungeon.
Why, certainly.
What's that room, Doctor?
An auxiliary operating room, maintained at a very low temperature.
It's not in use now.
Will you lead us, Doctor?
It would seem that this room has been recently occupied, Doctor.
You're familiar with my work.
I keep this room ready at all times for the more violently insane.
- You can see that it is not occupied now.
- Yes.
My apologies, Doctor.
I warned you that you might regret this action.
Are you mad? Why did you let him get away?
Let him? You think I had any idea what he was going to do?
Or that I could stop him?
The police have searched the place for him.
Then it's good that we were gone.
Frankenstein's been half insane.
He wants to operate tonight.
- The child complicates matters.
- Leave that to me.
He will have to be told.
Ygor will explain to him.
No, you do not understand.
It will kill her. You wouldn't want to kill your little friend.
But Ygor has a better idea. You will see.
You will have the brain of your friend Ygor.
Tonight, my brain... will be your brain.
Tonight, Ygor will die for you.
Help!
Elsa.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out to find Erik.
- In this storm?
- Yes, Father. I can't...
Father, what does he want?
I'm going to operate to give him a new brain.
He wants the brain of that child.
Take me home. Please, take me home.
Father. Surely you're not going to...
Take the child in there, quickly.
How did the patient react to the anaesthetic?
Surprisingly well, particularly the spinal.
I think I can safely say everything is ready.
Dr. Bohmer, our respective operations must be timed with the utmost precision.
Any delay in the transfer will mean failure.
Exactly, sir.
- Shall I proceed?
- Yes.
I must warn you... this operation may not be successful.
This may be the end of everything.
Better death... than a life like this... now that I have seen... the promise of a life forever.
Kettering's brain.
What will he think when he resumes life in that body?
Will he thank us for giving him a new lease on life?
Or will he object to finding his ego living in that human junk heap?
There's no sign of returning consciousness yet, Doctor.
I anticipated this.
Let me know immediately if there's a change in his condition.
Certainly, sir.
Dr. Bohmer, I can never thank you sufficiently... for your assistance and skill.
This may bring you the recognition which has long been due to you.
That's very nice of you, sir.
None of us will be safe.
Who's he going to get next?
Fellow townsmen, it's two weeks since my little daughter disappeared.
It's the common belief that she perished when my house was burned down.
But a search was made of the ashes... and no bones were found.
She was stolen, stolen by the fiend who murdered Carl and Josef.
We've searched the hills, the mountains and the forests, and he can't be found.
Why can't he be found?
Why can't the police find him?
There's a very good reason. He's being harboured, protected by someone.
There's only one person that would protect a maniac like that.
- Who?
- Dr. Frankenstein.
Let's go to Frankenstein and choke the truth out of him.
Mr. Ernst!
They're on their way to Dr. Frankenstein!
Stop! Stop right where you are!
When did you decide to take the law into your own hands?
When we found out we couldn't get any help from you.
Two men have been murdered, and we want that maniac.
My little child has been stolen.
The law in Vasaria has done everything in its power to apprehend this monster.
Maybe Dr. Frankenstein can tell us where he is.
Nothing's to be gained by hasty action.
Nothing's to be gained by waiting either... when the prosecutor's in love with Frankenstein's daughter.
That has nothing to do with my duty.
Let me have a few moments alone with Dr. Frankenstein.
If he's concealing this monster, he must be made to give him up.
If he refuses, you can take any action you want to.
Does that sound fair to you, men?
I'd like to see Dr. Frankenstein.
He isn't seeing anyone.
- He'll have to see me.
- Erik.
What are those people doing at the gates?
They're demanding to see your father.
Why? What do they want with him?
They think he knows something about the monster's disappearance.
What can we do?
I've got to see him before they do, or
I can't be responsible for the consequences.
- What is it you want?
- The villagers are getting out of hand.
If you expect the protection of my office, you'll have to be frank.
There are certain matters which must be clarified.
- What do you mean?
- The case of Dr. Kettering.
He did not return home.
He wasn't even expected there.
He did not leave Vasaria by train, as you intimated.
Your servants say his clothes are still in his room... which is locked by your orders.
I think the time's come for a showdown, Doctor.
Perhaps you're right, Erik. Come with me.
- May I have a word with you?
- Yes, sir.
It is imperative that we see the patient.
What is his condition?
His recuperative powers have proved tremendous.
He appears to have complete control of all his faculties.
Why did you deny that you were concealing the monster, Doctor?
It was necessary for a while.
You see, Erik, the monster, as you know, was a homicidal maniac.
He killed Dr. Kettering, but Dr. Kettering lives again.
His brain is now inside the skull of the monster.
I have replaced an evil brain with a good one.
I have made amends for the great tragedy... that my father and brother unintentionally brought to this community.
I've restored the good name of Frankenstein.
Let me show you.
He's been in there long enough.
We may be losing valuable time.
All right, men, he's had his chance.
Now it's our turn.
Come on!
Do you recognise me?
Tell me... who am I?
You are Dr. Frankenstein.
And you are?
You are Dr. Kettering.
I am not Dr. Kettering.
I am Ygor.
What have I done?
I am Ygor.
I have the strength of a hundred men.
I cannot die. I cannot be destroyed!
I, Ygor, will live forever!
I've created a hundred times the monster that my father made.
Bohmer! This is your work!
Don't touch him, Frankenstein.
He's my friend.
I should kill you, Frankenstein.
But after all... your father gave me life... and you gave me a brain.
It's the townspeople.
I can't offer you protection now.
Bohmer, turn on the gas.
Fill the house with it.
We'll kill all of them.
Get back! You may all be killed!
They're turning on the gas!
Bohmer! You must be mad!
Leave him alone.
My dear!
I told you it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Find him!
- Get out of the house! Hurry!
- But what about Father?
I'll go back for him.
Bohmer.
I can't see.
- Bohmer! Where are you?
- Here I am.
I can't see you.
Your dream of power is over, Bohmer.
You didn't realise... his blood is the same type as Kettering's... but not the same as Ygor's.
It will not feed the sensory nerves.
Bohmer. You played me a trick.
What good is a brain without eyes to see?
What good is a brain without eyes?

Landing on the dock!
Landing on the dock!
- Back! Back!
- Come on!
Fred! Fred!
I am here.
Two whole years.
I seems more like 200.
Look, honey, this crap is wide style.
I meet you at the end.
OK.
- That's better.
- Oh Jee is good having you back.
- Was the trip a success?
- A successful? Look.
20 tigers, 20 lions, 6 zebras
11 leopards and Cheela.
Cheela?
The most gorgeous lady that ever came out of the jungle.
A gorgeous lady?
Wait till meet her.
Come on, let me introduce you.
Hi, Cheela.
Cheela, listen, I want you to meet Beth, my sweetheart.
How do you do, Cheela.
You See? That's what I like about Cheela.
No jealousy.
Careful down there!
Hold it!
Stay here.
Young man, you are marvelous.
Where did you learn to do that?
Don't scare me like this again.
I could not bear.
- Nice work boss.
- Who tied that cage?
I do not know.
One of the loaders.
Pretty crap job. Go get an empty.
I have to cage this cat.
Wait for me in the baggage handling, honey.
The rest of you people better go for covering.
Everything was running fine.
Was all excited about your coming home...
And then this thing happened to Dorothy.
How serious is it?
Some sort of a glandular trouble.
Why didn't you write me about it?
Why worry you.
I left her at the Crestview
Sanatorium about two weeks ago.
 We've been with several doctors 
<I> and all recommended take it to this Dr. Walters 
<I> It really was an ordeal 
<I> Poor little Dorathy was as nervous as could be. 
 My mind was seted easy about having brought her to the right place 
 when, I picked up one of the medical books and I read some of his achivements. 
Medicine and Surgery.
 "Glands and their secretions 
" by Dr. Sigmund Walters.
"Dr. Sigmund Walters, of Crestview Sanatorium,
" He made not one but three attempts of racial improvment."
"He discovered vitamin E-2, which he belive, determines the physical characteristics of all forms of animal life..."
"The 48 chromosomes which shape heredity and the numerous hormones."
 I realized she wasn't
 listening to thing 
<I> I set down and tried to comfort her, but it was no use 
<I> The storm outside wasn't helping us either. 
 Coming through the book 
  I ran across to some of the 
 most fantastic achievements of this Dr. Walters 
 Such as a hand, three times as hard as should be 
 reduced to normal.
 A complete deformed child corrected by his glandular treatments 
 Described in words
I didn't understand
 how he changed a man's distorted feature. 
ACROMEGALIC FORM.
"The Acromegalic Form"
" Due to a hypersecretion
 in the anterior portion front..."
" of the pituitary glande".
- Dr. Walters will receive you now.
- Thank you.
I'm Dr. Walters.
Want to sit down?
- You Smoke?
- No, thanks.
I smoke that is, but I don't care for now.
I see.
- Which one is Dorothy?
- I am.
- You're her sister.
- Yes
You are both connected to the Whipple circus?
That's right.
Well what seems to be the trouble?
Well, I...
Dorothy has been losing weight all season.
We thought maybe it was overwork and...
Please Continue.
The reason much us to tell.
At the close of the season, a few days ago, she suddenly collapsed.
The doctor thought it was a glandular disorder, and recommended to we bring her to you.
Most ills are traceable to the glandular problems.
Could you prepare Miss. Colman to examination, please?
Sit down, please.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thank you.
You both perform in the circus?
No, my sister is.
I'm Mr. Whipple's secretary.
I see. In a way we have something in common.
In your business you use animals for entertainment purposes.
I in the other hand, use them for scientific experiments.
So, I read medical journals.
You've accomplished great things.
Oh, I've hardly scratched the surface.
There's so much more to be done.
One fears a single lifetime is far too short.
The patient is ready, doctor.
- You excuse me?
It won't be long...
 After our true talking, I realized we were lucky to get him, 
 because he really  was a very famous scientist  besides being one of the most charming man I've ever met.
Oh, so that's how it is.
Is he young?
So so.
Good looking? Of course, oh sure!
Tell me more about it.
Well, he is... taking me out to dinner a few times.
Well, maybe I better have a look on this guy, pretty quick.
Oh, you will.
Maybe at the winter quarters when we get there.
I invited him.
WINTER QUARTERS.
JOHN WHIPPLE'S CIRCUS
Nothing has changed a bit.
I'll be with in a minute, honey.
I'm gonna surprising you.
OK.
- It can't be that tough, John.
- Well is pretty dif...
Fred! Well, you old tiger bait.
How are you?
- Well, I'm not in a wheelchair yet.
- How was the trip?
Fine. Got everything I wanted.
- Everything.
- Oh, that's great!
I've heard you had a little troble on the dock.
Oh, Yes. One of the cats got loose.
No body was hurt.
Say look! When we gonna know for about the Beatty?
Well, haven't signed yet, but...
Do you think it was wise, to take all this new bunch of cats... without having Beatty signing the stage there for you?
Now, is gonna be all right, Fred.
Is gonna Be Alright.
Oh, Dr. Walters.
I'm so glad to see you.
- I took at your word, you see?
- How is Dorothy?
She is showing exciting improvement...
But I still have to keep her on observation  for a quite some time.
I don't know how to thank you for your interest in the case.
Mean you tell me that you got the both of them?
- Yes
- It's wonderful.
Mr. Whipple, this is Dr. Walters.
- Hello, doctor.
Beth just told me good deal about you.
And Mr. Mason, Fred Mason.
Miss. Colman told me a good deal about you.
- Is talking a little so, isn't she?
- Yes, but efficient.
You know, I always wanted to get behind the scenes in circus.
So I accepted Miss
Colman's invitation.
Good! Just in time we're going out look over the stable.
- Would you like to join us?
- I'll be delighted!
Oh fine. Come on with us.
He brought back some wonderful things.
I think we can...
If that wire comes on Beatty, let me know.
You better go.
Come on.
Let's get a closer look.
What do you think?
Pretty vicious looking.
Yeah, we will have them toned down before long.
That should be a interesting process.
I like to watch it some time.
- You are welcome at any time, doctor.
- Thank you.
Here come the lions.
Say, look at that baby.
Is Nero.
It's a killer.
He got four natives in the jungle and mangle a handler aboard the ship.
Maybe we ought get rid of him.
One of the zoos would buy him.
Oh, no, you don't. It's for me.
I'll get him in a tame.
- Any problem, Tony?
- No, they handle like babies.
- What do you think?
- Well, it's a fine health lot.
- Fred!
- Oh, Curley.
- Wow, it's good to see you, Fred.
- Finally, is good to be back.
- Did all right, ah?
- Yes
- How many?
- Forty.
- Forty. Forty?
- Yes
I will feed them, but...
You gonna explain meat last Tuesday, though.
Must have a lot of money invested  in this cats.
Well, is not the cost is the appeal.
Oh, you'll enjoy this.
Well, I can imagine what's gonna happen when they put Tigers in with them.
Is the intention to mix lions with tigers together?
Yes, sir, that's the idea a mixed act.
Get back.
Help!
Cheela! Cheela!
Let go! Let go!
Get back there.
No, John.
No no. Here.
You should no about mistreat animals.
I was just just bringing our fellow water.
Are you been warned about not to drinking on the job.
You're fired! Get out of here!
Come on! Get out!
Well, this is a surprise.
Why did not you tell me about this?
Oh, she is terrific.
She is almost human.
She is the center respect to the act, John.
Look, I want to show you something.
Come, come Cheela, here.
Turn around, turn around.
She seems to have far above the average intelligence.
She has a natural talent.
I want to show you something else.
Turn around, Cheela.
Cheela, I want you meet my boss, Mr. Whipple.
And, Dr. Walters, a friend.
When did you get time for all this?
On the boat coming over.
Jonh, she isa natural.
I think I can do wonders with her.
I want take charge of her personally.
Training, feeding, and everything.
Before you got the job.
Do you have many inquiries about selling this animals?
Yes, sometimes.
If you take an animal like this, suppose someone will buy it.
Oh, well if this animal works for the circus, and looks like she will... all the money in town couldn't buy her.
He's dead.
I've come to this conclusion,
Ms. Strand,
The type of species which we made experiments are not satisfactory.
Size, strength, the will to live, the essentials that we are trying to accomplish... like in these animals.
We have the elements which could make possible the we try to do.
I don't understand.
It's been proven with no doubt...
The glands can transform phisical mater to any size, shape or appearance.
Yes, that's true.
We have here in this sanatorium a rare case of follicular cyst... which induce the secretion of an inusual amount of sexual hormones.
- Miss. Colman?
- Yes
If we been able to create, through the median glandular extraction of specimens that have.
What's to prevent us transfusing these glandular extractions... from a human being into a higher type of animal?
The Authorities.
They won't permit it.
I see you're not trully a scientist,
Miss. Harper Strand.
The thing we are trying to do we must be getting.
- I'll be out this afternoon.
- Yes, doctor.
Photograph that.
20 years in the show business and now I get the ball on rush.
And all because of a stinky over grown monkey.
How do I like that...
This is why I'm here.
How would you like to get back that ape,
 and Whipple?
Hey, get out!
Can't you see we're talking business?
Yeah...
What it's all about, Mister?
I would like to get that ape.
You think you could steal it from there?
Steal it?
Just like that!
So easy?
Sure!
How much?
I will not give out the price if is reasonable.
When do I get paid?
Just as soon as the animal is on my truck.
It's a deal, Mister.
You got yourself a monkey.
How about us having a little drink, hein?
A little drink to a monkey business.
Waiter.
Hey! Doc! Doc!
Well, the ape is in the truck.
Well, how about my money?
What did you do? No!
Help me, doc! Doc! Wait!
I won't say... doc!
CIRCUS HANDLER MURDERED BY APE!
MAN KILLED BY STRANGULATION
NAILS OF BEAST PRESS THROUGH
BACK OF NECK SERVERING SPINAL CORD
Yes, I understand.
You can depend on me chief, absolutely.
I give you my word of honor.
All right, all right chief.
We got to find that animal.
They are holding me responsible.
She's bound to turn up.
She can't stay out of site forever.
If she attacks anybody else, we are out of business, you know that.
Well, we will find out.
Do not worry about it.
Oh, you don't worry about it?
Cheela, we are in the road to great things.
You're the answer of years of planning.
Fred.
Oh, hello Beth.
Where you been?
At the sanatorium.
Dorothy was operated on.
Operated on?
Why Dr. Walters said treatment would do the trick.
Apparently it didn't.
- Fred, I'm so worried about her.
- She'll be all right.
You can't expect them to do miracles.
Those things just take time.
- We are ready for you, boss!
- All right!
I don't will get you down.
Come on, give me a smile.
That's better.
Well, I take it out.
Keep your chin up, beautiful.
My God!
Don't go get in panic.
That's the first thing you got to learn on animal training.
But you're not in love with him.
Another gun! Quick!
See? Just like I said.
Nothing happened.
We've did it!
We've did it!
- Dr. Walters, we can't go on with that.
- Why not?
In the past i've been willing to helping you in experiments with animals...
But this is different.
I can't have my hands staining with human blood.
Look at that girl.
Slowly but surely, you're taking the life out of her.
It's Murder, Doctor.
You can't do it!
Why shoud a single life be considering too important?
Look Dr. Walters,
For 13 years I worked with you,
Shared your experiments,
Watch you gain the highest honors in the field of endocrinology.
I see you gain control of the physical characteristics of men... and change the breed and sex of animals.
I've listen your dreams of create a race of supermen.
Isn't that a lot of intent?
But while been doing you lost sight for something else.
- And that is?
- Yourself.
I saw you at  start watched you grow,
Watched your brain that once was fine and brilliant begin to get weak... and playing with things that no man or woman should ever touch.
Now maybe you listen to me.
Haven't I proved beyond any doubt the glands can transform phisical matter to any size, shape or appearance?
Yes, you have.
But ain't doing this...
When you took the glands from the guinea pig and graft into the rabbit, the guinea pig died.
When you grafted the frog's glands into a white mouse, the frog died.
And now you propose to experiment with an ape and a woman.
That woman will eventually die.
Then she will die in the advance of science.
And suppose your experiment is successful, what will you have?
A human form with animal instincts.
I won't let you do!
I'm going to the police!
You must stop!
You're right, Miss Strand.
My new creation needs the element of mental stability that can not come from a human brain.
Miss. Colman is essential to me for continue glandular injections.
Transplanting of cerebrum is certain death to her.
I can't afford that.
But you are a woman with a very receptive mind.
- No
- You're right.
The cerebrum is essential for the success of this experiment.
No! Don't do it!
Stop!
The sacrifice of Miss. Strand for the cerebrum operation proved worthwhile - Dorothy
Colman's condition improving -
She will continue to be useful to me -
 I saw it began and watched grew, 
 Watched your brain that once was fine and brilliant begin to get weak... 
 and playing with things that no man or woman should ever touch.
You are Paula Dupree.
Do you remember what happened?
Do you remember anything from your past life?
Your mind is my mind.
Your every thought is my thought.
What I tell you to do, you will do.
What I tell you not to do, you will not do.
Do you understand that, Paula Dupree?
 What do you have?
A human form with animal instincts. 
The mentality of Cheela, now Paula Dupree, is improving - it will be interesting to see how she reacts to her old environment, particularly Fred Mason -
I have 20 tigers, 20 lions and no
Beatty.
My idea is close the show.
- I would't say that.
- What you talking about?
He is the only man in the world can handle a show that with that many animals in it.
I'd like to take a crack at.
Oh, no, wait, Fred.
Captive and training one at the time that's one thing.
But to go into a cage with mixed animals and put in a show... that's quite another.
Only you can't just give up now.
You're in this too deep.
Now Fred, I know you're one of the best animal man in the business.
All right,  why don't you let me try?
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll start with one lion and one tiger and if I can not handle them,
I'll say no more about it.
No, I can't do it, Fred, it's too...
Hein?
So we are on?
If you got nerve enough to try it, go ahead.
That's a deal.
That's a deal.
What did he say?
Honey, I sold him my idea.
I'm putting on the animal act.
You'll what?
- Yes
Fred, you can't.
I won't let you.
Oh, honey, don't start to talking that way.
This is one big break of my life.
This is because I love you so damn much.
Oh Fred, I'm so afraid for you.
As long as you are out there waiting for me we  got nothing
 to be afraid of.
Could you retype...?
When you have time, do not hurry.
Slowly.
Ok, let him in.
You know what is the matter with them?
I do not know.
They seem to be afraid of something.
- Hello, doctor. Good to see you again.
- Mr. Whipple. Miss. Colman.
- Doctor.
- This is Miss Dupree a patient of mine.
- How do you do?
I hope you don't mind
I dropping in like this.
Oh, not at all. As a matter of fact you're just in time.
Fred is trying on a lion and a tiger together.
It's the first time?
As a matter of fact it is, we are all a little on edge.
OK, Bill, let in the tiger.
Caution, the lion!
Hal! Curley!
Do something, quick, someone!
Joe, Hal, bring your posts!
What you gonna do?
Oh you were marvelous Miss.
I do not know how to thank you.
- Fred, anybody hurt?
- No, I'm all right.
Stewart!
Go and get that hose!
Get the hose!
After all these years in the show business
I ain't seen anything like that girl.
She had that lion terrored to death.
Miss, never saw anybody do that before in my life.
No gun, no weapon, nothing.
I saw that cat back away from her.
You know we can use a girl like her around here.
What do you say, Miss?
First we better to do is take care of that head of yours, Mason.
Won't be a better idea.
Come on.
I do thank...
He talked to me and I let him...
This whole thing is unatural.
You should...
You'll never have an opportunity like this again.
I tell you, that girl's power with animals is uncanny.
You saw for yourself what she can do yesterday.
Yes, I saw.
Also I heard you lying in that cage.
It was only by the hand of fate that girl have no long.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
With her as extra assistent handler.
Oh, a cage full of animals with a girl mix up.
Doesn't make sense, Fred.
I don't intend to have a mix up act.
All I need is a handler stending outside in case of trouble.
No, I can't see it.
I don't think you can do it, Fred.
If you stop now, don't solve anything and certainly won't get you anyplace.
I'd rather not owner the circus if the success depend on the lives of the performers.
Oh well, now you are talking if those animals ran a hand and that was whats happen at all.
Was simple bad lock, that I was there, when the pedestal came down.
I tell you aren't a circus man, unless you let me have talk with that girl.
What I tell you is I won't do it!
All right.
Look John,
You know yourself there is nobody in this business I'd rather work for then you, but my mind is maid up!
I'm going after that girl, she and I are going to work lions and tigers together.
Now, If you are not giving us a chance,
I gonna find somebody who will.
Now, wait. Wait  a moment, please.
I am only thinking...
You... you make me feel as if signing your death warranty.
But if you insist on, go ahead and do it.
Thanks, John.
You don't want to get a hunch that with helping that girl, you and I will make
Circus history.
I hope it's not over your dead body, you stubborn...
Good luck.
A newcomer, Paula Dupree, has bounced out of nowhere and right into the Mason animal act in the Jonh Whipple Circus.
At press time, it was not understood just her part in it would be, but is safe to say she will be a decided asset to the act.
So, It's the big day, huh?
Well, it's the last rehearsal before we setup the attendents for the show.
- Music and everything.
- Where you'll open?
Right here in this town.
I'd like to give the local audience news as a break.
- Fred, how do you fill, hein?
- Oh, fine!
Do you think this all will be a success?
What do you thing?
With Paula here I can miss.
You ready, honey?
All right, Jim, start it!
Do not take your eyes of these cats.
OK, send them away.
I hope nothing happens.
I forgot to feed them.
Doesn't Paula go into the arena with him at all?
Oh no. No because when Paula and Fred are together in the cage together.
The cats seem so afraid of her... that they get confused.
They do not know whom to take orders.
Then she has power of control outside the cage?
That's the uncanny part of she does.
When she's there...
Fred can control those lions and tigers, without any trouble.
- Amazing, isn't?
- Amazing.
That girl can become one of the greatests animal trainers in the world.
Look at that.
- Let Nero in!
- Nero!
- He didn't tell me was gonna using him.
- Well, it's too late to stop him now.
Holy jump man!
Oh, he did it.
Fred, you did it!
Well you certainly did it, sun.
I'm convinced!
- How did you do it?
- Oh, that was super hot.
Honey, I want you live that easy to trade after we get married.
- Congratulations! You were excellent!
- Thank you, sir.
Overcame obstacles.
It's only a question of how long you want to keep the show going.
Thanks.
Well, it's a call for a celebration.
Will you joining us, Dr. Walters?
I'm sorry.
I've been away from the sanatory to long as it is.
It's a shame. Come on.
It's just... 20 years old if you rebuild...
Just a minute...
- What on those marks on her neck?
- That's what battles me.
Is a very powerful pair of hands who did this job.
Those deep claw like incisions in the back of the throat don't seen were made by human hands.
They've cut the spinal cord.
Tell me, young lady, what else you know about this thing?
I told you what I know.
So dark. I couldn't see very much.
Some sort of weird looking creature that came at me.
All right, Miss, you better find another room and get some sleep.
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- That's all folks. Go to your rooms.
Everything I planned complete destroyed.
All because your madness.
Your insane attempt to kill
Beth Colman.
You know what the police will do if they get you?
No, of course you don't.
They wouldn't know who's the jungle instinct that urged to kill
a female that stood between you and a mate?
They'll put you on trial... to you question up, to question at you... to don't know anybody is saying.
Then put you in a electric chair... and they kill you.
All because they won't understand.
They can't understand.
The one thing I hadn't counted on...
A terrific emotion will destroy the new tissues near gland growth.
I have myself part to blame.
I should've kepted you in a constant observation.
That's why I've looked at them.
I operated on you.
Grafted glands from a living woman in your body, watched you to transform...
Now I have to do it, all over again.
Graft new glands in your body.
Maybe another brain operation.
Taking another life to keep you on human form.
Well, Are you sure that is all the information you can give me?
It is important that the find her.
We open tonight.
Thank you, Dr. Walters.
I'm sorry to troubled you.
He can't tell us then anything.
He only knows her as patient.
Last time he saw her was at the rehearsal.
May I have one?
Fred.
You know?
There was something familiar about the face of that woman...
Whatever it was,
I saw that in my room that night.
What do you think it was?
It may sound fantastic, but
I think was Paula.
- Paula? It's ridiculous!
- I'm not so sure.
All seems to tie, and...
They said that woman was killed by claw like grip.
Gruen was killed the same way.
And all applies to Cheela, and...
I'm certain I saw
Paula's face that night.
- It was a... face of a...
- Wait a minut.
You're not trying to connect with Paula
Cheela, are you?
You said time and again Paula had a way with animals and it was unnatural...
Oh, look honey, you're letting your imagination run away with you.
Take it easy.
Well, I get to roll over.
I've get ready for the show tonight.
You mean you're going through without Paula?
Off course. I can't stop now, even if I want to.
But you said you couldn't control those cats without her standing by.
Stop worrying, will you?
I see you tonight.
CIRCUS JOHN WHIPPLE
Hey! Fred!
Fred, Listen, I...
What is the matter with you?
You look worried.
Well I am.
Is the weather report.
It's a good chance of storm going in here.
- Oh, we had storms before.
- Not this, indeed.
But that mixed animals act of yours is dangerous enough as it is.
If there is a flash or lightning, crash of thunder... that's no telling what might happen.
You worry too much.
You live this act with me.
Well, now you be careful!
Hello?
Oh, hello, Dorothy.
I was just on my way of the show.
It opens tonight.
You what?
You got to take me away from here.
I'm scared.
He is preparing me for another those operations.
Treatments, he calls them.
Darling, I'm surprised to hear you talk that.
You are getting the best care in the world.
I'm afraid, I tell you.
I won't stay here another minute.
Something terrible is going on.
I know it.
I can fill it!
Beth!
Dorothy!
Dorothy answer me.
Ladies and gentlemen!
You are now about to witness one of the most spectacular acts ever performed in any circus.
The most deadly enemies of the jungle, lions and tigers, mixed together in the same arena!
These feroses beasts... which until a few months ago, were roaming through the jungles...
Are now brought together, for the first time, by a man... who will make them do his every bit!
And now...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fred Mason!
Dr. Walters?
Dr Walt...
Well, Miss Colman.
Where is my sister?
I just come from her room and is not up there.
Calm down,
Calm yourself, Miss. Colman.
Never mind. Where is she?
I see her right the way.
By all means.
It is your privilege.
Please Follow me.
So you see Miss. Colman, you are about to witness something what no more eyes but mine has ever seen.
The transformation of an animal into a human being.
You can't do this.
I won't let you!
We're alone down here.
No one can stop me, not even you.
You're mad.
I won't let you do that.
I'll call the police.
Miss. Colman,
I'm a inherent believer in the association of thoughts.
Someone else once said the same thing to me.
Someone with a very clever mind.
Like yours.
And now you'll gonna watch this operation, and gonna be helpful to me.
Oh, Mr. Whipple, the storm is beginning to rain.
Get men along to the exits.
Keep thing rolling as usual.
Yes, sir.
We underestimated the animal intelligence.
 She scents what is comming.
She would love to get her hands on me.
Let Nero in!
Why?
I told him to keep Nero out.
I did too, Mr. Whipple, but he said the publicity was out with Nero on it.
Public knew it was a killer and that's why they came here to see him.
Damn...
Don't  stand, go and...
Ladies and gentlemen, please...
Fred, you can't go back in there.
Go get the ambulance. Quickly.
Cheela!
Don't shoot!
Get the vet!
Hurry up! Get the veterinary!
Fred, are you all right, son?
Yes, I'm all right.
There are deep slashes.
We get some help comming on the way now.
What happened?
Cheela, she came back.
She got me out of tha cage, just when one of the cats had me.
All right, all right you men, go and get the work.
Check those cages and see if they're locked.
The rest of you, start pulling out the big top.
She's dead.
Here now, Fred. Fred.
I gonna get you to the doctor.
Do not worry buddy.
Let's go.
 And so, behind these gates is buried the legend of a death 
 that was beyond human powers 
 and he played with things that no man should play. 
Here's another flash on that highway bus accident.
Dan McCormick, the lone survivor is been... taken to the receiving hospital for observation.
Attending physicians are astounded at his condition... because he shows no effects of the electrocution... that killed the driver of the bus and all of his fellow passengers.
You say the man is conscious?
Yes, it's the most amazing thing I've ever heard of doctor.
After a good night's rest he'll be ready to leave the hospital.
Come on, come on, give me those pants. I want to get out of here.
- Here, here, what's going on?
- I can't make him stay in bed doctor.
But I guess I ain't as tough as I thought I was.
Tough? You're lucky to be alive after a shock like that.
- Now get back into bed and take it easy.
- Ok, ok, you're the doctor.
This is Dr. Lawrence. Doctor, Don McCormick.
How do you do?
Dr. Lawrence wants to ask you a few questions.
Sure, glad to have somebody to talk to.
You know, for a minute I thought you was one of those reporters.
No, no, there are several of them downstairs.
- You won't like for publicity.
- Oh say, that's great.
I can use a couple good write ups in my business.
- What is your business Dan?
- Oh, didn't you know?
I run a high pitch down on the Midway, it's an act.
I'm dynamo Dan, the electrical man.
Fool around with storage batteries and stick my fingers into light sockets and... make sparks jump between my hands.
- You know, yokel shockers.
- Yokel shockers?
Sure, stuff to fool the peasants.
- It's all for effect, most of it's phony.
- Yes, I see.
Hey doc, get a load of this.
Supper in bed and I ain't even sick.
Yes, we going to make sure they take good care of you.
Well, I must run along now. Here's my card.
When you get out of here, just drop in and see me sometime.
- Sure, sure doc.
- Good bye.
So long doc.
Nice guy the doc.
Dr. Lawrence is one of
America's foremost scientists.
No kidding.
Dr. John Lawrence, 515
Forrest Drive, The Moors.
- Thank you Henry, that's all tonight.
- Thank you sir.
- Good evening Dr. Lawrence.
- Wong.
- Hello uncle John.
- Hello dear.
Oh, look at you.
- What's the matter? No date tonight?
- Yes and a very nice one,
And I waited to tell you about your tickets.
- Tickets? Tickets, what tickets?
- For the convention.
- Oh, yes, yes, when do I leave?
- First thing Wednesday morning.
Well, that gives me a couple of days.
- I've listed the references that you wanted.
- Oh, can't we get out of that?
I detest speeches.
It's probably because I've had to listen to so many in my time.
Well, here's your chance to get even, not that yours will be boring.
I wish I could be sure of that but electrobiology sounds terrifying.
Except to electrobiologists and that's who you'll be talking to.
Well, good night.
- We'll hope for the best.
- See you in the morning.
Oh and don't forget your medicine, I left it on your desk.
- I said good night.
- Good night.
Paul, why don't you give this up?
It will work, I know it.
With all the constructive things to be done, why do you concentrate on destruction?
- You call my work destructive?
- Must we go over that all again?
This theory of yours isn't science, it's black magic.
I believe that electricity is life... that men can be motivated and controlled by electrical impulse... supplied by the radioactivities of the electron.
That eventually a race of superior men could be developed... men whose only wants are electricity.
But man, you're challenging the forces of creation.
The forces of creation, bah.
You know as well as I do that half the people in the world are... doomed to a life of mediocrity... born to be nonentities, millstones around the neck of progress.
Men who have to be fed, watched, looked over and taken care of by superior intelligence.
My theory is to make these people of more use to the world.
By successive treatments, their bodies could be so electrolyzed... that they are no longer subject to the pains and frailties of ordinary mankind.
- Sometimes I think you're mad.
- I am.
So was Archimedes, Galileo, Newton Pasteur,
Lister and all the others who dared to dream.
50 years ago, a man was mad to think of anesthesia.
40 years ago, the idea of operating on the brain was madness.
Today, we hold a human heart in our hands and watch it beat.
Who can tell what tomorrow's madness may be?
No one Paul, least of all I.
Since I too believe that we've only scratched the surface of electrobiology.
But science through the ages is been used for the betterment of mankind... to give some faint ray of hope to these nonentities, as you call them.
But...
Now, now, now, together we've been very successful.
Let's drop it for tonight.
You hurry and clean up, there's some cheese and beer in the kitchen.
I'll make a welsh rabbit and we'll celebrate.
What do you say?
- Alright John.
- Good.
I won't be a moment.
- Do you like it?
- It's terrible.
Say, who are you?
- Mark Adams.
- Oh?
So you're Mark Adams, the big newspaper man.
Well, I have something to say to you.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Five people killed and the best thing you can do is write bad jokes.
Under his own power.
Oh, well look lady, five people were... killed and we treated it with the proper respect but that was yesterday.
Now the globe dispatch has a circulation of 300,000... say a million readers and they don't want to read anymore about the five that died.
They want to read about the one that lived Dan McCormick.
Where is he?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, come, come.
By the way, what makes you think he's here?
Well, I bought the fourth floor nurse a... dollar dinner and found the taxi cab that brought him here.
Now come on, get with the news item.
What's Dr. Lawrence's angle?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Ok, I'll wait.
You wasting your time, there's nobody here.
Nobody but us dogs.
Hey, you must be alright, he doesn't usually make friends so easily.
Sure, me and dogs always get along.
- What are your plans?
- Oh, I don't know.
I was headed for the county fair when that accident happened.
I was going to open up my act, guess I'm too late now.
Suppose I'll have to do something else.
In the meantime?
Well, in the meantime there's always that... good old 18 bucks a week from the unemployment insurance.
Of course, that doesn't start for a couple of weeks.
- Now, why don't you come and work with me?
- Eh?
- I say why don't you come and work with me?
- What doing?
Well, I was thinking about that electric act you used to do.
Oh, I already told you that was a phony.
Nevertheless, you survived an electrical shock that killed 5 other people.
Maybe it wasn't such a fake after all.
Maybe you've built up an immunity to electricity.
- What's that?
- Immunity?
Ordinarily, fatal doses of electricity can't hurt you.
Oh, you mean kind of like I was vaccinated against it?
Something like that.
Some cellular or glandular change is taken place which renders you immune.
- I'd like to find out what that is.
- Hey, wait a minute.
You don't mean you want to cut me open?
No, no, no, just take your blood count, examine your muscular coordination and... study your reflexes.
If we can find out what it is that produces this immunity against electricity... we might be the means of saving the hundreds of lives... that are lost every year through accidental electrocution.
You'd live right here too.
- You mean I get to eat here too?
- Surely.
Take it easy until you're well and strong again.
That's good enough for me.
Dr. Rigas, come here a minute.
He's my associate. Dr. Rigas,
I want you to meet Dan McCormick.
- Good morning sir.
- Hi you doc.
I've been trying to persuade
Mr. McCormick to come work with us... while we study his apparent immunity to high-voltage electrical shock.
Oh yes, yes, of course, forgive me.
I didn't recall the name for a moment.
- You're the one...
- Yes, I'm the one that lived.
And I've assured him that we would do nothing to injure his health in the slightest today.
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Well, then let's get to work.
What say, pup?
You ready Corky? Go get it.
- Good morning miss June.
- Good morning Dan.
- Lovely day, isn't it?
- Oh, sure is.
Well, are you beginning to feel at home around here?
Yeah, you know, every day around here is like Sunday on the farm.
- They're not working you too hard then?
- No.
Boy, they just give me a little shot of electricity and feel my pulse... and look in my eyes and tap me on the knee, you know how doctors do.
Oh, doesn't the electricity hurt?
No, I used to take more than this six times a day when I had my carnival act.
You know miss June, you look mighty pretty with those flowers in your arms.
Thank you Dan.
You reminded me of a girl
I used to be kind of sweet on.
She had a high wire act in one of the big Mac shows.
- What happened to her?
- Oh, she ran away with the fire eater.
Well don't worry Dan, I won't do that.
Hi Corky, come here kid.
Give me that ball, give me that ball.
- Good morning Miss Lawrence.
- Well, you do get around, don't you?
- How goes the great experiment?
- Nicely, thanks.
- How long is a thing like this take?
- Oh, weeks, months, a year perhaps.
You see, when a scientific discovery is announced to the world...
To the world, it must be proved beyond chance.
Well, you had a week now.
What progress have you to report?
Oh, I think we can safely say that the preliminaries have been completed.
Well, that's fine, now we can get to the main bow, what you doing tonight?
Why Mr. Adams, I thought you were here professionally.
Well, if you think there's anything amateur...
Look June, you're making it awful tough for me, I'm trying to romance with you and what do I get?
- Biology.
- By the greatest authority in the world.
Well, maybe is.
But if you're interested in the subject,
I too have a few ideas along these lines.
Hi. Oh, I hope I didn't interrupt.
No, it's all right,
I wasn't getting anywhere.
Hey, you and Corky seem to be getting along all right.
Sure, him and me gets along swell.
Say, you want to see something? Get a load of this.
Alright Corky, lay down, down.
That's it, turn over on your side.
Over, hold it, hold it.
Now, clear up on your back, turn over on your back, hold it.
Hold it, now back on your side.
No, no the other side.
Hold it, attaboy.
He learned that one quick.
I think maybe when I go back to the carnival, I'll get myself an animal act.
- Dan, will you come in here please?
- Sure.
No, not you. No, no, no.
I don't like that guy.
- You don't know anything about him.
- Do you?
I know that much of the success of this laboratory is due to him.
- He's a genius in his line.
- Maybe.
But I'll bet he spent his childhood sticking pins in butterflies.
What do you think Corky?
- Hey doc?
- Yes?
- Where's Pete?
- Pete?
Yeah Pete the rabbit, in the end case there.
Oh, he worked yesterday.
- Now, if you step on this please.
- Sure.
Say, ain't we going to wait for Dr. Lawrence?
Dr. Lawrence is away for a few days attending a scientist convention.
He left full instruction about the experiment, now just relax.
That's right.
Down please, thank you.
Now just relax.
You're perfectly all right, you can get up now.
- Hey doc, what happened?
- Must've dozed off for a minute.
- Oh, feels like my hands are asleep.
- Oh, that's strange.
Just the usual voltage, enough to maintain your immunity.
Oh, I wouldn't know from that scientific talk.
- You all through with me now?
- - Yes, that's all for today.
- Ok. So long.
- Good bye.
Hi you Corky, come on kid, let's go, eh?
What's the matter?
Come on Corky, come on kid.
Come on, I won't hurt you.
Ah, it's good to be home.
Conventions are alright in their way but I'm for holding them all in my own living room.
Yes, I always thought them pretty much a waste of time... same old fogies with the same old theories.
Oh, this wasn't so bad.
Now our Latin American friends are really doing some worthwhile things.
By the way, where is Dan?
He was sitting out in the garden just a few minutes ago.
Maybe doesn't know what time it is.
- Wong, call Mr. McCormick.
- Yes doctor.
I'm worried about Dan.
Oh, what's the matter? Isn't he happy here?
I guess so but he seems to slowed down.
- Perhaps it's a reaction to our experiments.
- Oh, maybe we're crowding him too much.
I'll check the reports after luncheon.
He's coming now sir.
Oh, how are you Dan? Did they take good care of you while I was away?
Oh, I'm Ok doc.
Special for you Mr. Dan.
No thanks, I ain't hungry.
Finish your lunch doctor, I'll take care of him.
Take his plate back to the kitchen Wong, he may eat it later.
Yes doctor.
Uncle John, is something the matter with
Dan, something strange is happening to him.
Oh, nonsense child.
I admit he looks rather badly but as Dr. Rigas says... that might be the result of our experiments.
Well, I wish you'd make sure.
I will, now that we've got that scientific conference out of the way.
Have you any idea what might be wrong?
Well, nothing definite but you remember the goldfish?
- Goldfish?
- Digs and Betty, in your office.
- Oh, yes, yes, of course.
- They died.
That's too bad.
- Something in the water, eh?
- Yes sir, electricity.
Paul, look here.
- June asked me to give you this.
- Oh yes, yes, thanks.
- What you make of Dan's condition?
- As I suspected, he's nervously upset.
- I ordered a few days rest.
- Take a look at this blood specimen.
Seems me be way below normal in cortisol count.
It was taken from his arm this morning.
Nothing much like the specimen we took from him when we first arrived, is it?
No, isn't.
- I don't know what to make of it.
- Have you kept a record of his treatments?
Of course, I'll get it.
Here it is doctor, I think you'll find everything according to your instructions.
Oh...
I don't know what's the matter with me, I'm weak as a kitten.
Oh, you overtaxed yourself at that convention.
Probably.
Why won't you go upstairs and lie down for a while?
You watch Dan carefully, we mustn't let anything happen to him.
Well, of course, I'll take care of him.
You go to bed.
It's been a good many years since I've been tucked in.
- It's very pleasant being waited on.
- Are you sure you'll be all right?
I hate to run out on your like this, but it's Mark's night off and we planned...
Now, I understand perfectly, and please don't worry about me.
Well, here your reference books and your paper and your pencil.
- If you take my advice, you go to sleep.
- Thanks.
- There just a few things I want to look up.
- Promise?
- Yes, I promise. Now run along.
- Good night.
Good night.
Well Dan, I have here a nationally advertised cigarette, now if you watch closely...
I'll put the cigarette in the palm of my left hand and make it disappear.
Now watch me.
Right out through the elbow, pretty good, eh?
How about a little card trick?
Yeah, you like card tricks? I've a standard deck of playing cards here.
Now if you just pick any card out of the deck, any card at all.
Don't let me force the Ace of spades on you.
Any card, that's it, take one of those right there.
That's fine, now... if you look at the card, remember what it is and put it back in the deck.
Ok, put it back in the deck there, anywhere at all, just... slide it in there, that's it, put it in there...
Hey Dan?
What goes on in here?
I don't know. I'm showing Dan some card tricks and I guess I didn't go over so big.
How's Dr. Lawrence?
Oh, he's much better, I made him promise go to sleep early.
What seems be the matter with him?
Well, overwork I guess, he was pretty nauseated and awfully weak.
Sounds like someone is been dishing out mickeys around here.
Mickey?
Yeah, that's a little thing they give you when your presence is no longer required.
Now, where would uncle
John get a thing like that?
Dan, I'm ready for you.
Mark, I'm not going.
- There's something wrong around here.
- It certainly isn't with Dr. Rigas.
Dan seemed anxious enough to go in there with him.
Yes, that's just it.
Dr. Rigas seems to have some sort of a hold on him that the rest of us don't know about.
Oh June, don't go Edgar Allan Poe on me.
Look, you see these tickets?
They cost a buck 10 a piece.
And when a newspaper man lays out cash for tickets, that is true love.
Hurry up, will you doc?
- You like these treatments, don't you Dan?
- Yeah.
They make me feel strong like I used to.
- They wear off too quick.
- Oh well, we'll fix that.
Now stretch out please.
That's right.
This is our final experiment.
If we're successful... we shall have proven a theory that will revolutionize the world.
A theory that will silence completely those scoffers who babble of trivialities.
And we shan't be disturbed.
I've taken care of that.
Yeah, that's what I thought you said.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Better?
Look June, this is a big night, I got a lot of important things to do and say... but I can't get started if you're not going to pay attention to me.
- Oh Mark, I...
- Now wait a minute, let me finish.
I had this whole routine all worked out.
The show, supper, a little music, you know, sort of work up to a gradual like..., and now you dust me off with the first pitch.
What's the matter? Don't you want to go?
Of course I want to go and I want the dancing and I want the supper... and most of all I want to hear what you have to say.
But Mark, I'm worried.
Take me back to the laboratory and let me check on uncle John and Dan... and make sure they're alright... and then wind yourself up for some enthusiastic cooperation.
Now you made a deal.
Now you'll do exactly as I say.
Step down from there.
Success.
Even more than I'd hoped.
Come.
Now, point your finger at that condenser.
Stop, that's the power of the energy in you.
We must conserve it, I've prepared for that.
Come over here.
Get into this rubber suit, it'll insulate you.
That will save the electricity that's giving you your strength.
With these rubber gauntlets, your power is safe.
Without them, it will run from you through everything you touch.
There you are, not
Dan McCormick but something I created.
Obeying my will, I can give you life or take it from you.
- Paul, what are you doing?
- Finishing the experiment... that proves once and for all that my theory of electrobiology is correct.
Look, there he stands, the shell of a man.
Electrically alive, every impulse controlled by me.
Come here.
- You must be mad.
- Of course I'm mad.
The while you were fooling with the conventions, I had conquered destiny.
Think of an army of such creatures, doing the work of the world, fighting its battles.
Look at him, the worker of the future, controlled by a superior intelligence.
We must assemble all the great scientists and show them this creature, we must...
- Where going?
- To call the police.
- You destroyed a human being, that's murder.
Oh please don't, you're a brother scientist, you must understand.
What is one life compared to this discovery?
Oh, he'll live, a beautiful existence.
No pain, no sorrow. John, don't.
Stop him.
Dan, Dan. Don't you know...
That's enough, let him go.
He's dead.
You killed him, remember that. You killed him.
When they ask you, you tell them. You killed him.
You come, I must get that power out of you.
Come.
Hold that.
You'll remember nothing of what happened except what I told you.
You killed him.
I killed him.
Alright sugar, take your look and let's get going.
Uncle John.
What happened?
Dr. Lawrence came into the laboratory to check the treatment I was giving our patient.
I left the room for a moment, there was a crash.
When I came back, our patient was choking Dr. Lawrence.
- I was too late to help.
- Do you mean to say Dan killed him?
- I don't believe it.
- Ask him.
Dan, it's a lie, isn't it?
You didn't kill Dr. Lawrence, did you?
Come on Dan, we're your friends. Did you kill him?
I killed him.
- Is Mr. Stanley in his office?
- I'll see, what is your name please?
June Lawrence.
- Yeah?
- Miss Lawrence to see you.
Have her come in. Dr. Lawrence's secretary.
- You go ahead with the preliminaries.
- Yes sir.
Come in Miss Lawrence.
Mr. Stanley, I want to talk to you about Dan McCormick.
Of course, sit down.
- Now, what about Dan McCormick?
- Dan didn't kill Dr. Lawrence.
- He's signing a statement that says he did.
- I know but Dan couldn't kill anything.
He was kind and gentle.
Well, something is happened to change Dan completely, something terrible.
Must've to make him confess a murder he didn't commit.
Now Miss Lawrence, your uncle died of a broken neck, caused by a brutal choking.
A powerful man did that.
Now you yourself admit that Dan and Dr. Rigas were alone in the laboratory at the time.
- Have you any reason to suspect Dr. Rigas?
- Oh, I'm all mixed up.
Maybe Dan did kill him, but he wasn't himself.
Now, now, wait a minute, take it easy.
- How long have you known Dan McCormick?
- Ever since he came to work for my uncle.
Get along all right together?
Went out to dances and parties and so forth?
Oh?
I see what you mean, no, we've never been out together.
I'm engaged to Mark
Adams of the globe dispatch.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm not more coherent in telling my suspicions but... don't treat this like an ordinary killing.
There's something tragic behind this.
- And now with this confession...
- Of course you must realize that a... confession cannot be accepted by the court as conclusive evidence... when the charge is first degree murder, I still have to prove my case.
I know but you'll introduce the confession and it's bound to influence the jury.
Miss Lawrence, I give you my word... that I will do everything I can possibly to help Dan McCormick.
Then find out if
Dr. Rigas has actually been... following my uncle's instructions in the laboratory.
The District Attorney moving swiftly through the preliminaries... promises a speedy trial in the case of Dan
McCormick, the so called electrical man... accused of murdering Dr. John
Lawrence, noted scientist.
To expedite matters, he is requested the appointment of a commission... to determine McCormick's sanity.
Dr. Rigas, the District
Attorney would like to see you.
Of course, show him in.
How do you do Dr. Rigas?
We're sorry to disturb you sir.
I wasn't doing anything of importance.
We'd like to have you explain just what treatments Dan McCormick was undergoing... and what bearing, if any, they might have on his condition.
- Of course, won't you sit down?
- No, thank you.
Well, here's the case history.
I completed a record of the experiments and treatments... given in accordance with Dr. Lawrence's instructions.
I see.
Just what was the purpose of these experiments?
Dr. Lawrence was trying to determine what furnished the immunity... that enabled Dan to escape electrocution in that accident.
That called for quantities of electricity to be given, did it not?
Oh no, just small amounts, enough to maintain immunity as that chart shows.
I see,
Did this application affect any change in him?
Well, he did become moody and irritable, but I can't see what connection there is... between that and the mild treatment he received here.
What's this doc?
Looks like an operating table?
Oh, that's an electro thermostatic table.
We've succeeded in curing many malignant diseases with electrical heat.
Would you care to try it?
No thanks doctor, I'll take your word for it.
I wish he could tell us what he thinks.
Oh well, all dogs respond to certain vibrations.
I remember my aunt Hattie's house, that's aunt Hattie on my father's side, she had...
Oh, it's no use Mark,
I'm worried and I'm scared.
I feel sure that
Dr. Rigas did something to Dan.
I'm worried about what it is, and I'm scared we won't found in time.
Yes, so am I sugar.
How about your paper?
Won't they help? Don't they want to know?
Yes, if we could go to them with something definite.
I tried to tell the chief what we suspected and he started calling a man in a white coat.
Of course, of course, anyone who commits murder must be momentarily insane.
Otherwise they wouldn't do it.
Well Dr. Rigas, thank you for your courtesy.
Don't hesitate to call me any time I can be of help.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- Dr. Rigas?
- Yes.
Dan was insane, wasn't he?
They can't hold him legally responsible, can they?
That will be determined tomorrow.
- Yes but those doctor's, they...
- Don't worry.
Dan's business will be taken care of.
The District Attorney is invited me to be present at the examination.
You have been reluctant to discuss the night of the crime... but I assure you that your reticence will not prejudice us against you.
We want you to feel perfectly at your ease.
You did kill Dr. Lawrence?
I killed him.
Perhaps if we go back over your boyhood again... we can find some mental meeting ground.
As I remember your story... you were brought up in an orphanage.
There was a man there, he hit you often.
He hit you hard.
He hurt you, you cried.
Nobody would help you.
All your life, you've been anxious to get even with him.
In your mind Dr. Lawrence... was that man because he ordered the treatment that hurt you.
You did get even with him, didn't you?
You feel better, you keep telling yourself you got even.
No.
I... killed him.
And in conclusion,
I say without hesitation... that the accused Dan McCormick, suffers from acute melancholia.
- Induced by a persecution complex...
- In our opinion then... is that make him mentally irresponsible?
In other words, is he legally insane?
On the contrary, he is decidedly sane... and definitely responsible.
Thank you doctor.
You've already testified that you're a newspaper man.
- That's right.
- A feature writer?
Well, my stuff carries a byline.
Then you'd do almost anything to get a good story, wouldn't you?
I'd do anything I could to save an innocent man if that's what you mean.
Thank you, that's all.
And when I returned to the laboratory... the accused was standing over the body of Dr. Lawrence.
- What did he say?
- He kept repeating, I killed him.
The cause of death was a severe dislocation and... partial fracture of the third and fourth cervical vertebrae.
- In other words, a broken neck.
- That is correct.
Thank you.
We find the defendant guilty as charged.
To be put to death before midnight of the 29th of May... in the manner prescribed by law.
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is your local reporter bringing you... interesting highlights on the day's news.
First, let's consider the case of Dan McCormick.
The man who used to do an electrical act at fairs and side shows.
Well, ironically enough, the last act of his little drama will find him... dying in the electric chair where all the immunity in the world won't help him.
Alright, Dan.
Well, looks like he's on his way.
Oh, be careful.
What's the matter, getting jumpy?
I guess so, these things always get my goat man.
Hello Joe?
Well, he just went into the execution chamber.
Mark is inside to watch him go.
What? Sure I can speak up.
No, there's nothing the matter with my voice.
Did you ever cover an execution?
That's what I mean.
Well, that's that.
- I could do with a drink.
- Me too.
Hey Sully...
- What's going on up there?
- Oh, I don't know.
Joe, they gave him three shots and he's still alive.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Say Mike, did you hear that?
Must be some wrong in there.
He's taken all they can give him.
Listen to this, they can't kill him. He just killed two guards in the execution chamber.
He just broke through, he's headed for the yard.
Hey, you hear that?
Don't touch him, he's full of electricity.
He just broke through, he's headed for the gate.
He's got the warden with him but they can't shoot.
Poor guy is walking dead.
No, the warden can't run.
If he starts Dan will grab him and he'll shrivel up like a potato chip.
Has anybody seen him?
Take it easy.
Have you had any trace of him since he walked out of the prison?
Boys, I'll be absolutely frank with you, I haven't heard a word.
The experts say that he can't live more than three hours.
He broke out of prison at 11:15.
And right now he may be dying in some out of the way spot.
Maybe hours before we find what's left of him.
Here's a late bulletin on the McCormick escape.
The body of warden Harris is been found in the woods near State Prison.
Apparently, the warden tried to get away from McCormick and was electrocuted.
McCormick is still at large, a menace to everything and everybody.
Three men died during his escape and countless others are in danger.
Stay indoors, refuse an admittance to your home and notify the police if you see him.
He can only live a few hours because the electricity which gives him life... is running out of his body with every step he takes.
Fred.
- Hey.
- Fred.
Mary Beth.
You can absolutely quote me as saying that the danger is passed... that the public has nothing...
- Yeah?
- Urgent on one.
- Stanley speaking.
- My name is Frank Davis.
I'm at the Lakeside Rod and Gun Club.
A man just came out of the bushes and scared my wife.
- It must be that escaped convict McCormick.
- Yeah?
Alright, thanks
Mr. Davis, I'll take care of it.
Sergeant, I want you to have 10 men, two squad cars downstairs in five minutes.
- Yes sir.
- What happened?
McCormick just scared the life out of some people out at Lakeside... and he's stolen a pair of rubber boots.
- Rubber boots?
- But then he won't die.
- Did you say lakeside?
- Yes.
- Well, that's out at the Moors.
- Yes.
Hey, put aside, hey look out.
Get away from that steed.
Attention all police and sheriff details...
Dan McCormick, convicted murderer who escaped from State Prison tonight... is somewhere in the neighborhood of Oak Road and Crescent drive, the Moors.
- He's headed for the laboratory.
- Step in it Reagan.
- May I help you?
- I was just tidying up a bit.
- How nice.
- Yes.
- Well, I think I'll be going.
- Is this what you wanted?
Go on, take it, read it.
It contains a most amazing record of the extraordinary experiment... was only completed tonight when Dan McCormick walked away from the electric chair.
I knew you'd done something terrible to him.
Terrible? Was it terrible that I gave him life?
I haven't made a great discovery and I present him with a spectacular demonstration.
Tonight, the whole world will be talking about Dan McCormick... not a handful of musty scientists but the whole world.
You mean, you deliberately let Dan go to jail when you might have saved him?
- At first, I intended to...
- But...
No, no, no, no, no, he really killed your uncle.
Sure, he was under my control at the time... and didn't know what he was doing but he killed him.
My efforts of controlling, in fact were so successful... that the temptation of putting him to the supreme test proved too strong.
- And they gave him a sanity test.
- Yes.
Ironical, isn't it?
Dan McCormick as you knew him was doomed... from the first day he came to this laboratory.
For years, I'd hoped to find a subject with immunity... that would enable me to test my theories.
You mean you deliberately destroyed him?
I killed one human life in order to prove one great scientific truth.
You know, it's a curious fact... that ever since my earliest experiments with rabbits and Guinea pigs...
I've always found the female of the species... was more sensitive to electrical impulse than was the male.
It's fortunate that we met here.
Shall I show you how it's done?
Dan...
Stop, stop Dan, stop.
Stop, I tell you. Dan.
Stop, I tell you. Stop.
Can't you hear me? Stop.
I'll take the power out of you.
Dan, it's the police.
Dan, don't run away, we know what they did to you.
Here's the book, there must be some way to cure you.
Dan please?
Alright, Lachlan Mack, come with me. Sergeant, cover the ground.
Blake, Murphy, around that way, the rest of you fellas come with me.
- Rigas.
- Electrocuted.
Dan?
Look.
He's just out at across the field.
- He's carrying something.
- It's a body.
- June.
- June?
Dan, Dan, where you going?
Dan.
He's going to hit the fence.
Dan, Dan, put me down.
- He's caught on the barbed wire.
- Dan.
If that cuts through that rubber suit, he's finished.
Dan.
Dan, get away from that fence.
The electricity is running out.
And when Dan carried me out of the laboratory, I held onto it.
- Is anyone else seen it?
- No one alive.
We can have photographs of the notebook and... and photostats of the pages in Rigas' own handwriting.
- Do you think you ought to print it?
- Do I think I ought to print it?
Why, the story will get me the Pulitzer prize.
Do you want to make it possible for someone else to do what's been done to Dan?
Well no but...
Yeah, I see what you mean.
