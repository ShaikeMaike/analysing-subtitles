Papa!
Papa!
What now, Hildy?
Look!
Gee whiz. Again.
What´s the matter, Gus?
Cigarette.
Ken riding her?
He was, but not now.
Hildy.
Whoa, whoa.
Doggone that kid.
Look at this.
I hope he´s all right.
Young´uns fall light.
He´s used to it.
He could get hurt.
Saddle Shorty.
I better go see.
Ja, Boss.
Never mind, Gus.
Ken.
Yes, sir?
Come here.
You all right?
Sure, I´m all right.
Cigarette toss you again?
Yes, sir.
You ""digged"" your heels in her.
I didn´t.
Did you, Son?
Yes, sir.
Ken, aren´t you ever going to grow up?
I´ve told you not to clap your heels into her.
Look at that bridle.
Second one you´ve broken this week.
I´m sorry, Dad.
Oh, you found the saddle blanket.
What saddle blanket?
I lost it yesterday afternoon.
You forgot to cinch the saddle properly.
Yes, sir.
Gee whiz, it´s all ""tored.""
Will you keep quiet?
It got caught on some barbed wire.
You´re the doggonest kid... for losing, busting, and forgetting.
Breakfast is all ready.
Where´s Ken?
He´s coming.
Cigarette tossed him again.
I don´t know what
I´ll do with that boy.
Doesn´t pay any attention to what I say.
Always losing equipment or breaking it somehow.
He´s still a child.
He´s old enough to have his wits about him.
He´s walking around with his head in the clouds.
It´s a wonder he doesn´t trip.
Morning, Mom.
Come on, darling.
Eat your oatmeal while it´s hot.
Good heavens.
What is it?
Ken´s report card.
I suppose you´re not surprised you haven´t been promoted.
No, sir.
Here, look at your marks.
Let him eat his breakfast first.
Just as a matter of curiosity... how do you go about getting a zero on an examination?
40 in history, 1 7 in arithmetic, but a zero?
Just as one man to another, what goes on in your head?
What have you got to say for yourself?
Nothing, sir.
What were the questions you missed... in that English exam?
We were to write a composition.
Couldn´t you think of anything?
I was going to write... about how you lost your polo mare... how the albino stole her from Banner.
Well, why didn´t you?
I got to thinking.
I thought we had time.
I thought the hour had just begun... when the school bell rang.
You never even got started.
Not a single word, Ken?
No.
Just daydreaming, huh?
No, I was thinking about--
About what?
About my colt.
You haven´t got a colt.
Dad, give me a colt, won´t you?
You´ll get one when you learn how to treat one.
You´ll have to buck up.
Trouble is, you don´t try.
I do try, Dad.
I´d like to see some proof.
Meantime, you´ll study an hour a day... to make up your work.
[Knock On Door]
Come in.
Good morning,
Missus.
Good morning, Gus.
What´s today, Boss?
Good day to move the horses.
It´s time they were off the meadows.
A storm´s cooking up.
Can I help?
Four older horses have to be in shape for the rodeo... and those three-year-olds have to be broke.
Can´t I help move them?
Great guns, no.
It´s tough enough to move 1 00 horses... all fresh as blazes after a winter out... without a kid along to make them nervous.
- I´ll be right out.
- Ja, Boss.
Want another cup of coffee, dear?
No, I had enough.
Got to get started.
Kenny, you can ride any horse on the ranch.
Why are you so set on having a colt?
It isn´t just riding.
I want a colt to be friends with me.
I want a colt of my own, all my own.
You better start your studying.
Get it over with.
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.
Ken, what are you doing?
I´m doing my arithmetic, Mom.
[Alarm Rings]
Where are we going?
To watch Dad bring in the horses.
We can take the shortcut.
No, you better stay here.
It´s tough enough bringing in 1 00 horses... all fresh after a winter out... without having a girl tagging along making them nervous.
Those horses ain´t scared of me.
Good morning.
Nice work, Banner.
Banner don´t let those mares get away with nothing.
Banner´s got everything it takes to make a great horse-- brains, heart, and courage.
If he´d just pass it on to all the colts.
What horses we´d have then.
Whoa now!
Whoa now!
Whoa there!
Look out, Gus.
They´re stampeding!
Gus, try to head them off.
Stop them, Banner!
They´re making straight for the rock slide.
Head them off, Banner.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
What are you doing here?
I--I came to see the horses.
I didn´t mean to do it.
I didn´t mean to scare them.
[Whinny]
Jeepers, if I could ever have a colt like that.
Are we on the downgrade?
I never had so many bills and less money to pay them.
We can´t sell our horses at a profit.
They´re good horses with good blood.
Mm-hmm, all but that albino strain.
They got a crazy streak in them.
No use trying to sell them.
I wouldn´t even get back the cost of raising them.
I´d rather shoot them.
I would, too, if they weren´t so doggone fast.
I hoped to get one decent colt out of that bunch.
Rob... give Ken a colt.
Huh?
I want you to give Ken a colt.
After that stunt he pulled this morning?
You know he didn´t mean to.
He doesn´t deserve a colt.
Won´t you ever give him one?
Sure. I´ve been expecting to.
If he pays attention to his studies--
Uh-uh.
No.
That´s another thing.
That isn´t going to get anzwhere.
Didn´t he study today?
He exposed himself to his books.
Good heavens. Nothing I say to him makes any impression.
He wants his own colt.
He can´t think of another thing.
But that´s all backwards.
You don´t bribe children to do their duty.
It´s not a bribe.
What would you call it?
I just have a feeling...
Ken isn´t going to pull anything off.
It´s time he did.
Maybe a little thing like this... would turn the trick.
That isn´t a little thing.
It isn´t easy to break and school a colt.
I won´t have a good horse spoiled by his carelessness.
Rob, it´s important.
He´s got to succeed at something.
What he needs is--
Is to snap out of it.
If you want to put it that way.
He needs to grow up.
How would having his own colt help?
Oh, you know.
Something of his own... responsibility.
He´d have something real that he cared about... more than those things he goes mooning about.
Don´t go.
I´d like to give Ken a colt.
I´d like to get closer to the boy somehow... but every time I get set for a get-together session... he hands me a facer like what he pulled today.
Rob, didn´t you ever want anything... more than anything else in the world?
Yes. You.
You do understand.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Humming]
Where´s Ken?
Probably looking at the ducks on the landing.
For Pete´s sake, what ducks on what landing?
That old print of mine.
He likes to look at them.
Gus says Rocket broke away last night.
Thinks she´s got a colt somewhere.
We´ll have to look for her.
I´ll find her.
Good. I´ll go with you.
Son, I´m taking back yesterday´s order.
You can forget that hour of study.
Thanks, Dad.
And, Ken...
I´m going to give you a colt.
A colt?
A colt of my own?
Mm-hmm.
I´ll give it to you a week from today.
That´ll give you time to make your own choice.
I can have any colt on the ranch?
- Ayearling?
- That´s right.
Gosh.
Jeepers, maybe I can have the one I saw yesterday.
Come on, you old jughead.
Come on there.
Oh, come on. Come on.
Oh, step on my foot, would you?
Come on.
Why don´t you take Highboy for your colt?
That chump?
Don´t think I´m riding Cigarette because I want to.
It´s because
I have to.
Then how about Lassie?
She´s as fast as anything and black as ink.
Who said I wanted a black horse?
How about College Boy?
He´s smart like a fox.
I´m going to pick a filly.
I know the one
I want, too.
I hope I find her.
Hey, don´t do that again, Hildy.
Cigarette´s kind of nervous.
She might kick you.
She better don´t.
I´ll kick her back.
Thanks, Tim.
OK.
Ready, Ken?
Yes, sir.
Don´t see why
I can´t go, too.
You´re a girl.
That´s why.
Check your cinch?
Yes, sir.
Let´s go.
Ken, don´t you want your hat?
Oh, thanks, Mom.
Don´t see why
I can´t be a boy.
Even you´re a boy...
I guess.
Maybe you think it´s funny, giving you a colt... when you deserve a good hiding.
Flunking all your exams... then pulling that stunt yesterday.
Don´t think
I´m letting you off.
I´m not.
I haven´t gone soft.
Don´t get that into your head.
I expect as much now as I ever did.
This isn´t any reward... because you haven´t won any reward.
This is a partnership.
One of these days,
I´ll need your help.
You have to be trained so you can give it.
Every man needs training.
Discipline.
I got mine at West Point.
And how.
You´re going to train that colt.
I´ll help you with the first breaking... but you´ll train it, and it´ll train you.
Yes, sir.
You and your mother may have to care for this ranch... without me pretty soon.
Where will you be?
I may have to go back into the army.
You understand, don´t you?
Yes, sir.
You make a good pony out of that colt... and let it make a man out of you.
Yes, sir.
I rode all through here yesterday.
I didn´t leave any colts behind.
If Rocket had a colt, she wouldn´t leave it.
I saw a colt yesterday... that got separated from the bunch in the stampede-- a sorrel filly with a cream mane and tail.
Sounds like
Rocket´s yearling.
Rocket´s?
The filly sired by Banner last spring.
That´s what was wrong with Rocket-- she missed that little filly.
She´d very likely console herself with a yearling.
Should pick up a track around here someplace.
Hey, Boss!
A cat.
That´s a mountain lion, all right.
Ja. A big one.
Haven´t had one around here for a long time.
Good thing we got the brood mares out of here.
Maybe we better look around that cave.
Well, it got one of them.
It´s dark brown.
It´s Rocket´s, I guess.
Tim was right.
She had one.
Didn´t she know it was dead?
Yes and no.
Mares are funny about death.
They´ll leave a dead foal... then remember it and hunt for it.
Will the mountain lion get any other horses?
Not now, Kenny.
They´re all out on the range.
Can´t he get the horse and colts there?
Not where there´s no cover.
Their only chance is surprise.
If a horse is off by itself... a lion will jump on it, bite through the spine.
Quick kill.
[Whinny]
It´s Rocket.
And her filly.
What a pretty little flicka she is.
Flicka<
What does that mean?
Swedish for ::little girl.´´
Flicka. That´s what I´ll call her.
My colt.
Your colt?
Yes, sir.
That´s the one I want.
Rocket´s filly, Ken?
Yes, sir.
I hoped you´d make a wiser choice.
You know how I feel... about Rocket´s line of horses.
But she´s fast.
Rocket´s fast, too.
They´re my worst horses.
There´s not one among them with any real sense.
The mares are hellions, the stallions outlaws.
They´re untamable.
I´ll tame her.
Nobody´s ever been able to tame a one of them.
You want a horse that´ll be a friend?
Yes, sir.
You´ll never make a friend of her.
Look what they did to get back together.
No fence in the world will ever hold them.
You better change your mind.
No.
OK, Ken. I promised you could make your own choice.
But remember--
Rocket´s loco... and 1 0-to-1 the colt is, too.
But she may not be.
Banner´s her father.
All right.
We´ll bring her in tomorrow or the next day.
It´s silly to write horses´ names on things.
Horses can´t read.
People can read.
But Pop can´t.
Besides, you ain´t even got a horse yet.
What do you mean
I haven´t got a horse?
Well, it ain´t here.
Dad´s bringing her in today.
[Honk Honk]
[Honk Honk Honk]
That´s Mr. Sergent.
He´s got lots of race horses.
He´s got a fat belly, too.
Hey, Gus, is Rob around?
Ja.
He´s in the house.
Hi, Rob.
Hi, Charley.
How you been doing?
Good. You?
Swell.
Glad to see you.
Sit down.
Rob, I´m shipping a carload of horses to Los Angeles.
Maybe you´d like to go in on the deal... and share the shipping expenses.
Might do that.
There´s room in the car for four more horses.
Sounds pretty good.
You know, Pop says
Flicka´s loco... like her mother.
Don´t say that, Hildy.
Well, ain´t her fault.
She can´t help it if her mom´s crazy, can she?
Banner´s got sense.
She could be like her father, couldn´t she?
I don´t know.
When I do something dumb...
Mom says I take after the old man... and when I do something smart...
Pop says I sure don´t take after the old lady.
You haven´t got anything like Rocket.
That she-devil can outrun... any animal you´ve ever seen.
You´re crazy.
Like to make a bet?
Hello, Charley.
Well, hello there, Nell.
No. Don´t get up.
I only have a minute.
What are you two talking about?
Rocket.
If I could get a mare to do #5 miles an hour--
She´ll make you a fortune... if you could break her.
My broncobuster can break any horse.
He can do it if she´s worth breaking.
Worth it?
Didn´t I tell you?
How much do you want?
Dollars.
You got a stopwatch?
No. I got a speedometer.
Good enough.
Let´s go.
I´ll get lunch ready for you.
[Honking]
There they are.
Isn´t Flicka beautiful?
[Honk Honk]
She´s heading for the north range.
We´ll clock her there.
The ground´s flat.
[Honk Honk]
She´s like a locomotive.
Does she always run with her nose up?
Yeah. She´s a stargazer.
[Honk Honk]
[Honk Honk]
Look at the speedometer.
Faster, Boss.
She ain´t half trying.
[Honk Honk]
If she does #5,
I´ll buy her.
Jumping jeepers!
Well, what do you say?
It´s a deal... if she´s delivered sound in wind and limb.
Just how you´ll do that is anybody´s guess.
You leave that to me.
Look out for Rocket.
Get in there, get in there!
Tim, throw a rope on her.
[Whinny]
Won´t be easy to get her in.
Stay with her, Tim.
Come on!
Get that noose off her neck.
Be careful, Rob.
Think I´d deliver her with string hanging on her?
I put it on.
I´m going to get it off.
Look out!
Open that chute gate so she can see through.
Get in there.
Shut the gate.
Get the truck.
Whoa. That´s it.
Sergent expects her in good shape.
Try not to skin her up.
Get her out of here.
Well, that´s that.
You mean that´s $500.
It´ll come in mighty handy, won´t it?
Dad, look!
Oh, Rob.
That finished her.
Well?
She´s dead.
Poor old Rocket.
It´s too bad, but these things will happen.
Just takes little lick to kill horse.
There´s one thing
I can still do.
Hello, Williams?
This is McLaughlin.
OK. Thanks.
Look, Williams, I got a load of horses for you.
Yeah, those albinos.
Yep. Every one of them,
Rocket´s whole tribe.
There should be some good horseflesh among them.
All right, your own price.
Good.
Yep.
There are nine of them.
Wait a minute.
There may be 1 0.
Ken, come here.
Here´s a chance to do a sensible thing.
I want you to choose another colt... and let me sell Flicka to Mr. Williams.
I´m asking for your sake as well as mine.
What´s the use having another Rocket?
You saw what happened.
I´m going to tame Flicka.
That´s impossible.
Sometimes bad horses get tamed.
You don´t want a loco horse, do you?
I want Flicka.
Look at me.
Dad, please.
She´s mine.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Williams.
I thought there was one more.
No. There are only nine.
Right.
I´ll send them over.
So long.
Haw!
Haw!
Git!
Well, that´s that.
Sure is a wild one.
We´ll let her think it over.
She´ll go right through that wire.
She´ll never go over.
It turned her.
Dad, she has got sense.
Flicka!
I knew it, that crazy--
Rob, hurry!
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There now.
Don´t think she´ll pull out of it.
Maybe it´s just as well.
Hadn´t been this way, it would´ve been another.
A loco horse isn´t worth the bullet... it takes to shoot it.
Now easy, girl.
Flicka.
Eat your dinner,
Kenny.
Do I have to, Mom?
You heard what your mother said.
Flicka, she´s--
Let him go to her.
He can´t do her any good.
Gus and Tim dressed her cuts.
She snaps out of it, she´s got water and oats.
Oh, Flicka, I didn´t mean to hurt you.
Get well.
Please be all right.
Gee, she was pretty.
What do you mean ::was´´?
She is.
She´s beautiful.
I meant when she was running back there.
Say, Ken.
Tomorrow, if you want to take care of her...
I´ll do your work for you.
Would you, Hildy?
Gee, that´d be keen.
Sure.
I´ll exercise Cigarette... bring in the wood, and dry the dishes.
You can stay with Flicka all the time... except when you´re sleeping.
Thanks, Hildy.
[Rooster Crows]
[Ring]
Gus, she´s going to be all right, isn´t she?
Pretty good chance... if we could get her to eat.
Maybe she don´t like oats.
I´ll get her some hay.
Whoa.
Don´t run away, Flicka.
Don´t be afraid of me.
I´m Ken.
This is hay.
You´ll like it.
Have some.
Take it easy.
She´s been scared pretty bad.
She´s eating.
She´s going to get well.
Ja.
It´s good sign.
Move her to the calf pasture.
There´s shade there and a running stream.
And she´ll be alone.
I thought horses like company.
Not her.
She´s a lone wolf.
She might jump out of the calf pasture and get away.
She won´t jump out.
She won´t jump anything for a long time.
[Whistling]
Ken. Breakfast.
Coming, Dad.
What´s he so chipper about this morning?
Flicka. She´s better.
Coming along, huh?
Mm-hmm.
She´s almost well.
The cuts are all healed up... and she´s eating like a horse.
Ooh.
Maybe we´re going to have a pleasant summer after all... if she doesn´t turn out to be another Rocket.
Oh, I hope not.
Ken, what kind of manners is that?
Sorry, Mom.
Morning, Dad.
Morning, Ken.
How were the ducks on the landing this morning?
What ducks on what landing?
Oh. Those.
Hardly noticed them.
Been so busy with Flicka.
Now that Flicka´s getting better... don´t forget you´ve got other duties.
Oh, yes, sir.
Give some time to your colt... but not all your time.
I won´t.
Will you come down... and look at Flicka this morning... see how she is?
Will Her Highness let you get near her?
Well, not too close.
She´s still a little scared.
But she´ll let you look at her... from the other side of the fence.
That´s big of her.
After breakfast, I´ll take a look.
Oh, swell.
Ooh!
Kenny.
Good morning, Flicka.
Flicka, Dad´s coming to look at you.
Be a good girl and don´t run away.
Well, she does look good.
Her cuts are all healed up... except for the one on the right front leg.
It´s almost well.
She´s beautiful.
Dad?
Do you think she´s... loco?
I´d have sworn it by the way she´s behaved... ever since she was born.
In fact, we´ve never seen her... except when she´s looked terrified.
Every horse looks wild in the eye... when it´s terrified.
She tried jumping that fence.
Anyone can try the impossible once.
There´s the old saying--
::It couldn´t be done... but the darn fool did it anzway.´´
Horses have jumped over 6 feet.
Maybe Flicka thought she could do it.
We´ll forgive her that one.
Point is, will she learn?
Can she learn?
Rocket couldn´t.
Or wouldn´t.
Dad, maybe I´ll never get her trained.
Heavens, Son, what have I been telling you... all these weeks?
Didn´t you understand?
What did you think loco meant?
Sort of goofy or wild-- hard to handle.
Oh, no, Son.
Much more serious than that.
There´s inherited insanity among animals... just as there is among humans.
Bad blood carries on... and albino blood isn´t safe for any filly to have.
But you said... maybe it´s just because she´s been scared.
She´s got a very intelligent face.
Much better than Rocket´s.
Fine, delicate mouth.
And such lovely eyes.
Mm-hmm.
Set far apart.
We´ll have to see how she responds to training.
How can I train her?
All you can do is try and win her confidence.
You know, Son, if you take everything away... from a living creature-- freedom, friends, its home, habits... happiness-- it´ll turn in sheer need and desperation... to the one thing that´s left.
In this case, that´s you.
Me?
Yes. You´re her whole life now.
Make her to like it.
Oh, I will, Dad.
I will.
Give her love and companionship.
Talk to her.
Will she understand me?
Of course.
A horse can tell you a lot of things, too... if you watch and expect it to be sensible and intelligent.
Pay attention to all the little signs.
The way it moves its body.
The ears. The eyes.
The whinnies.
That´s its way of talking, Ken.
That´s right.
There´s a neigh of terror.
A scream of rage.
A whinny of nervous impatience.
[Flicka Snorts]
The nicker of longing or hunger... or friendliness.
You learn its language, and it´ll learn yours.
And never forget-- horses understand everything you say to them.
Everything, Dad?
Everything.
[Flicka Snorts]
You mean... if they´re not loco.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
All right, all right... you´re hungry for your oats... but I´m hurrying as fast as I can.
There.
There you are.
Come and get it.
Good, isn´t it?
You do understand me, don´t you, Flicka?
Eat it all so you´ll be big and strong like Banner.
You´ve got a very smart father, Flicka.
You´ve got to forget all your wild ways... and be just like him.
Who are you talking to?
Flicka.
Aw, horses can´t understand people´s talk.
That´s all you know.
Flicka understands everything I say.
What´s more, she talks back to me.
Aw, poo.
Maybe you don´t know it... but horses got a language all their own.
There´s a neigh of terror... a scream of rage... a whinny of nervous impatience... a nicker of longing--
Eee-h-h-h!
There´s a nicker of hunger.
R-r-r-r.
Can you wiggle your ears?
Oh...
[Whinny]
What´s she saying now?
Oh, she´s telling me she´s finished her oats.
Oh.
Maybe she´s saying thank you, too.
Maybe she wants more oats.
[Whinny]
Maybe she´s had too many.
Maybe she´s got a pain in her stomach.
Maybe she needs some castor oil.
Only gluttons need castor oil.
[Whinny]
[Whinny]
She wants something.
Oh, I know.
She´s thirsty.
Why don´t you go and get a drink?
There´s a whole lake full of water.
Oh, all right.
Boy, you sure are getting spoiled.
Oh, gosh. I forgot.
Your Pop´s back.
For Pete´s sake.
Why didn´t you tell me?
I´ve got to see him right away!
[Whinny]
You hear that?
That means she doesn´t want me to go.
Aw, I betcha it just means... she´s got gas on her stomach.
[Whinny]
Bet you I didn´t forget anything this time.
Flour, salt, ham--
What about my hairpins?
How could I forget anything as important as hairpins?
They´re in there.
Dad!
Dad, did you get it?
Get what?
You know.
Sorry. I forgot all about it.
You did get it, didn´t you?
Sure, I did.
It´s a beauty.
Where is it?
Well,just a minute, Son.
Your work done?
Yes, sir.
Did you exercise
Cigarette?
Yes, sir.
She´s in her own pasture... and I tied the gate.
Good. Is she hot?
No, sir. I cooled her off on the way home.
Give her a good workout?
Yes, sir, and I didn´t lose or break anything.
Good work, Son.
You´re really coming along.
Can I have it now?
It´s in the front seat.
You were right, Nell.
The filly sure did the trick.
He´s a changed boy.
Flicka!
Flicka, I´ve got something for you!
Look. Brand-new saddle blanket.
Tailor-made especially for you.
Isn´t it keen?
When you grow up, we´ll put it on you.
Won´t even know you´ve got a saddle on your back.
We´ll go riding on the range... fly like the wind.
Look.
Got your name on it.
Oh, Flicka, I didn´t mean to scare you.
Honest, I didn´t.
Come back, Flicka.
Oh, please come back.
You don´t have to have it.
I won´t ever ride you... or put a saddle on you... if you don´t want me to.
You´ll just be my friend.
[Whinny]
Mom... did you ever want anything terribly?
Most everyone wants something, dear.
But you´ve grown up.
You´re married.
You´ve got Dad and me.
Why, you´re finished.
Then I shouldn´t still be wanting, should I... if I´m finished?
But people do, Ken.
Everyone?
Always, Mom?
Don´t you ever really get finished?
Yeah, I wonder.
Maybe sometimes, for a minute or two.
What is it you want now, Ken?
I do so want Flicka to be all right and not loco.
Oh, perhaps she isn´t loco, dear.
We don´t know yet for sure... but if she is, Ken... wanting won´t change it.
If she is, it´ll look bad for her, won´t it?
Let´s see what happens when we try to halter-break her.
Does she have to be?
We´ve got to find out, don´t we?
I suppose so.
As soon as she´ll let you touch her... we´ll have a try at it.
What if she won´t let us?
She loves you, doesn´t she?
Oh, yes.
I´m sure she does.
Well, that shows she´s intelligent.
How does it, Mom?
It´s just a way of putting away fear.
Don´t you understand,
Ken... that if you find love... if a person or an animal finds love... it´s the same as finding safety.
It´s comfort and friendliness and help.
Everyone longs for it.
And if Flicka´s found it... and yet doesn´t have sense enough... to know she´s found it... and goes around being crazy and silly with fear, then--
Then she´d be loco.
[Humming]
Good morning.
Where´d you catch them?
At that deep hole under the falls.
Put them in here.
Thank you.
Well, Boss, what today?
Look over the mowing machines.
We have to get at the haying soon.
Those stackers need repairs.
Oh, Gus.
Before we begin...
I want to help Ken halter-break his filly.
I want you and Tim to be on hand.
Where, Boss?
The calf pasture, and we´ll do it right now.
But, Dad, maybe... maybe we better wait a little while.
She´ll let you close to her now, won´t she?
Oh, yes.
Flicka´s my friend now.
She likes me, but--
Good. I´m glad to hear that.
It´s a fine thing to have a horse for a friend.
Flicka´s never had a rope around her neck.
She may fight us putting one on her now.
Maybe she´ll act like she did when she arrived.
Maybe she´ll act like Rocket.
She has to be halter-broken sometime.
Might as well get it over with.
Get ready.
I´ll be right down.
Didn´t you find a broken mule shoe last night?
Yes.
That´s good luck, ain´t it?
Yes, but if I make a mistake...
Dad may blame it on Flicka.
And then he wouldn´t--
Call her, Ken.
Flicka!
Have your loop ready, Tim.
[Whistles]
Put your bandanna around her neck.
Tie it in a loose knot.
Easy, Flicka. Easy.
Now take your belt off.
Slip it through the bandanna.
Now take ahold of the belt and lead her around.
All right.
Now bring her back.
Let go of the loop.
Hold your hand under her chin.
That´s it.
I´d call that halter-broken.
But it isn´t a halter, Dad.
You really take some convincing, young man.
All right. Give us the halter, Gus.
There you are.
Put it on her.
Go ahead, Son.
But how, Dad?
Just the way you put it on Cigarette.
All right, now lead her around again.
How did she get halter-broke, Dad?
That´s the way we break horses... on the Goose Bar ranch.
You figure it out, Ken.
Come on, boys.
Let´s get at those machines.
Then she´s not loco.
She´s not loco.
You could have knocked me down with a feather.
I knew she liked me pretty well, but gosh... she let me halter-break her... without even an argument.
Flicka´s a smart filly, just like her father.
All girls are smart like their pops.
[Whinny]
She´s calling me.
She sure is, Kenny.
That´s the nicker of friendliness.
Bet you she´s just hungry.
Gus, something´s happened to her!
She´s limping.
Something´s wrong with her front leg.
Flicka, what´s the matter?
What´s happened to you?
It´s that barbed-wire cut.
But that was all healed up.
But it didn´t heal right.
The leg´s swollen.
Is that bad?
Means infection.
Infection? That´s dangerous, isn´t it?
You betcha.
Hildy, you talk too much.
I think it hurts her.
She ain´t bearing any weight on it.
What do you do for a horse infection?
Just the same like for people-- put on poultice so it´ll drain.
I´ll get Mom to make a poultice.
Ja, I think you better.
She has got sense, hasn´t she, Mom?
She knows we´re helping her, doesn´t she?
Of course she does.
She´s a good little girl... and we´ll get her out of this in no time.
Slack off!.
Rip it!
Dad, I´d like to talk to you.
What about?
About Flicka.
For the love of Mike, can´t you see I´m busy?
Can´t be worrying about that filly.
I´m sorry, Dad.
Just a minute, Ken.
What is it, Son?
Flicka worse?
Dad, she´s so sick.
Will you come down and see her?
Maybe you can do something to help her.
All right. I´ll come have a look at her.
She´s lying down again.
Good heavens.
What´s happened to her?
She´s been getting awfully thin.
Thin!
I´m afraid she ain´t going to pull out of it.
Pull out of it?
She´s dead already.
How long´s she been like this?
She´s been real sick the last few days.
It´s the fever.
It´s burning her up.
She´s going to die.
We´ll have to put her out of her misery.
Oh, no, Dad.
I´m sorry, Ken.
It isn´t fair to an animal... to let it suffer like this.
Pick a time when
Ken isn´t around.
Gus!
Gus, when are you going to do it?
I was--I was going down soon now, Kenny.
Don´t do it tonight.
Wait till morning.
Just one more night.
Gus.
Well, in the morning, then.
It´s got to be done.
Your father gave the orders.
I know. I won´t say anything more.
[Dog Barks]
Shhh.
I´m coming, Flicka.
I´m coming.
Flicka?
Flicka, where are you?
Oh, my little Flicka.
Give him one of these every hour.
I´ll call to see him tomorrow morning.
He´s a very sick boy.
It isn´t only the cold and fever--
He had a shock,
Dr. Scott.
Something happened--
He´s been sad about a horse I gave him.
It´s been sick.
Oh, I see.
Well, you´d better have this prescription filled right away.
I´ll follow you into town... and bring it right back.
Don´t worry.
How is the little boy,
Missus?
Gus, he´s so sick.
Poor little boy.
[Thunder]
Gus, is Flicka dead?
No. Tim and me fixed her up in a blanket sling.
She can´t stand alone... but she drank a bucket of water.
Did Rob say you didn´t have to shoot her?
No, but I couldn´t do it.
When I found them like that this morning, I--
I know what you mean.
She´s got plenty of strength.
Sometimes I think, Gus, miracles can still happen.
It was the water washing the fever out of her... but it was Ken giving her courage.
All night that little fella sitting by her... saying, ::Hold on, Flicka.
::I´m here with you.
The two of us together.´´
I´ll tell Ken.
Maybe it will help him get well... knowing she´s still alive.
There´s a storm coming up, Missus.
I´ll stay here if you need me.
Thank you, Gus.
[Thunder]
I thought you´d never get here.
How is he?
Better. He´s been resting.
Good. We need some hot water.
Did you do as I told you?
Boss, I couldn´t.
I gave the order, and you´ve had plenty of time.
I just couldn´t do it.
Where´s the rifle?
In the bunkhouse.
Go get it.
Oh, Rob, please don´t.
He knows she´s alive.
He thinks she´ll get well.
Give him something to hope for.
[Thunder]
Would have been better if she were shot weeks ago.
It´s been nothing but misery for everyone.
Look what it´s done to Ken.
I wish you wouldn´t, Rob.
He needn´t know.
He´ll hear the shot.
He´ll think it´s thunder.
He´ll know it´s the rifle.
I´m sorry, but... it´s just no good letting sick animals live.
It´s raining.
The rain won´t hurt her, darling.
Flicka´s been out in thunderstorms all her life.
That was Dad´s car, wasn´t it, Mom?
Yes, dear.
[Whinny]
[Growl]
Please, darling.
It was only the thunder.
[Whinny]
Don´t worry about the cat.
I´m staying with you for the night.
Feel a lot better if I had a drink... and some dry clothes.
I´m a drowned rat... but so are you.
Rob!
Oh, Rob.
Yeah?
You all right?
Sure.
Ken´s asleep.
Gus is with him.
I got worried about you.
[Whinny]
But I thought--
I heard a shot.
It was a mountain lion.
Did you get him?
I will before morning.
I couldn´t do it.
She wants to die, she´ll have to do it by herself.
Ken heard the shot.
How´d he take it?
Well, he took it.
He didn´t question it, he didn´t seem to rebel.
If he wakes up and asks... don´t tell him she´s still alive.
But, Rob--
She may be dead by morning.
Wouldn´t surprise me.
He´s accepted her death.
If he knows she´s still alive, he´ll be all upset again.
I won´t tell him.
[Nickers]
[Whinny]
Thanks, Flicka.
[Whinny]
Morning, Dad.
How do you feel this morning?
Much better, thanks.
Enough better to go out in the warm sunshine?
I guess so.
It´s doctor´s orders.
Come on. I´ll help you get dressed.
Dad...where are we going?
The calf pasture.
That´s right, Son.
[Whinny]
Flicka.
It is Flicka.
But I thought--
I didn´t shoot her.
I couldn´t.
That shot you heard?
That was the mountain lion.
I killed him.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Easy, Ken.
[Whinny]
Flicka.
[Whinny]
Oh, Flicka.
She did get gentle, didn´t she, Dad?
Gentle as a kitten.
She´s given us a lot of trouble, Son... but she´s taught us some important things, too.
You, responsibility.
Me, there is such a thing as hope beyond hope.
That sometimes, when things are at their lowest ebb... all we need do is have a little more love... a little more patience, and a little more faith.
I have urgent business with His Excellency, the viceroy.
The viceroy has left orders.
He is not to be disturbed.
- I have urgent business with him.
- Commandante, we have our orders.
And I have my oath of allegiance to His Spanish Majesty.
How do they expect a man to sleep?
Confound that--!
Oh, it's you, is it?
I might have known.
And what matter is there more important than that I should have peace?
Pardon, Your Excellency.
A Dutch ship has crashed off the harbor.
- Good. Are there many survivors?
- They were immigrants.
These routine experiences bore me.
See that I have a full report either tomorrow morning...
...or at the end of my siesta, whichever is later.
Forgive me, Your Excellency, but--
But, but, but, always these buts.
What is it now?
The ship was the Golden Maid.
Well, they have charming names for their ships. Good night.
Her captain survived and he requested an audience.
He says his is a special case, a special plea.
Won't Your Excellency please speak with him?
The ship's papers.
When will you people realize that a tropical climate...
...calls for a tropical tempo?
But no. All I ever hear from you is that every golden minute...
...has 60 golden seconds.
Why does it have to have 60 golden seconds?
Why can't it have 30 golden seconds?
And why do they have to be gold?
Why can't they be silver? Why can't--?
Why don't you tell me these things?
I have to do everything around here myself except take my siesta.
That you take care of for me.
You're in the presence of the viceroy and governor of New Granada.
His Excellency
Don Juan Alavarado do Soto--
Your Excellency, this is Captain
Van Horn of the Golden Maid.
Formerly Captain Van Horn of the former Golden Maid...
...as I understand it.
It is a very simple matter
I have to present to you.
He means to "Your Excellency," doesn't he?
Yes, Your Excellency.
Meaning me!
What I wish to discuss with--
With Your Excellency--
I have already been told you have a special plea.
You will promptly specify the nature of your special plea...
...which I will promptly deny.
We are peaceful immigrants from Holland...
...on our way to new homes in America.
We were blown off our course by a hurricane...
...and our ship crashed on the rocks outside your harbor.
Most inconsiderate of my rocks.
I shall have them reprimanded.
We wish at our own cost, to repair our ship, buy food, fill our water casks...
...and then proceed.
Would you ask a Spanish town to provision a Dutch ship?
But we are in great distress,
Your Excellency.
And you will be in far greater distress,
I can assure you.
The law is quite explicit.
It forbids these waters to all ships except those of His Spanish Majesty.
But we were blown off our course.
We didn't mean to--
It is not my fault that you're a bad navigator.
- What's this?
- My ship's papers, if you please.
They constitute a grant of land in the New World.
Well, well, well.
Indeed, a sort of grant or charter to settle on lands in....
Bless me, in the Carolinas.
The Carolinas.
When will people realize they cannot give away...
...what they do not own?
The Carolinas belong to His Spanish Majesty.
And not to this English king...
...who so lavishly bestows them upon all the scum of Europe.
How many survivors are there?
Not more than 30 are left of us.
Well, I could've hoped for more.
But even 30 or 40 hard and willing workers are better than none.
We do not wish to remain here.
Those who are able-bodied I will send to the back country...
...as indentured servants.
As for yourself, since you seem to be their leader...
...I will provide you with a sort of special status.
So that in the years to come, it is not inconceivable...
...with fidelity and diligence, you might even become a freeman.
Your Excellency does not understand.
My people are not slaves to be sold by me, or bought by anyone.
Your people are trespassers and are for me to dispose of as I see fit.
In any case, this grant is worthless.
What a high-strung young man.
Prison, Your Excellency?
For the time.
We will hang him later.
I'm obliged to you for your kindness.
Welcome to our little home, mate.
I suppose you're wondering who we are.
Well, that there, that's Swaine.
He's a seaman off a British schooner.
He wants to say he's glad to make your acquaintance.
He can't tell you himself because they cut out his tongue.
This here's Paree. We call him that because he landed from France.
They say they've got a town in France called Paree.
Me, I'm Pillory Gow, just waiting the day they'll hang me.
- For what crime?
- For no crime at all, mate. None of us.
We was just earning an honest living in our profession...
...which is to sail our merchant ships...
...wherever the needs of trade happen to take us.
That they took us into these waters....
Well, that's our misfortune.
They captured our ships unarmed, and we ourselves, made prisons of war.
But what war? It's more than we can tell you. And you?
A peaceful voyager like yourselves.
At least I thought I was.
Laurent Van Horn is my name, and Holland, my country.
My friends and I, we hoped to leave oppression behind us...
...and settle in the Carolinas.
We dreamed to build a new home in the New World...
...where there would be freedom for all.
Fire!
We thought the Barracuda was here,
Your Excellency...
...but no, he was not here--
I'm tired of excuses.
"We thought the Barracuda was here,
Your Excellency.
But no, he wasn't here, he was there.
When he was there, he wasn't--" Well, I won't have it.
You catch me the Barracuda.
Your Excellency, for several years, we have done--
I'd do it myself, but here I am working 20 hours a day...
...being properly fitted to receive my bride-to-be.
While you and your men sit around doing nothing.
Not catching the Barracuda.
Your Excellency, we've done everything humanly possible.
If I have to go out myself and catch him...
...as soon as my honeymoon is over...
...I can assure you--
You are to fit me, not to fondle me.
A thousand pardons, Your Excellency.
You'll need them if that cloak drags...
...because I'll send you to a thousand deaths.
I shall arrange for a bed of hot coals to be started today.
One month from today, this bed will have an occupant.
The Barracuda or yourself.
The choice is your own.
- You understand?
- I do, Your Excellency.
Now for my cuffs.
I think Venetian lace would be nice.
Yes, Your Excellency.
- Or petit point?
- Oh, yes, Your Excellency.
There is another phrasing of that last paragraph, my child...
...of which you are probably well aware.
Señor Obispo, it's absurd that I'm not allowed to go out on deck.
Without your duennas?
They left me. They got seasick, and I thought the air might help them.
Well, I hope it doesn't.
If I am to be unhappy, they might as well be unhappy too.
Even if it's not for the same reason.
And what is your reason, my child?
I wish I knew.
Go forward and shout when ready.
Aye-aye, sir.
Señor Obispo.
Who is that man?
Why do you ask, my child?
Oh, surely, now that I'm about to be married, I....
Well, I was just wondering if I would find my betrothed as handsome.
That sort of worrying, my child?
You are about to be married to enter the world to--
Yes, to enter the world as a bullfighter enters the ring.
A bullfighter who has never seen a bull.
Is my betrothed as handsome?
As handsome?
Well, he's a viceroy and all viceroys are men of noble bearing.
You still haven't told me who that man is.
He's a Hollander.
A man of many words, none of which make sense.
The existing order does not meet with his favor.
What my father would call a malcontent.
His Excellency, the viceroy of Mexico has a gift for precise phrasing.
A malcontent indeed.
Come in, Lupita.
Señora Montalvo and Señora Perez are at the door of death.
Again?
Yesterday and the day before and the day before.
- Well, it has been a very heavy sea.
- Yes.
They beg His Lord Bishop for final consolation.
Well, I will go to them.
At least they seem to have found a way...
...to keep from being bored on a sea trip.
They're really unable to do anything but be unhappy about themselves.
They'd given up everything but the Holy Faith by the time I left them.
Give me your cape.
Holy saints. You aren't going on deck without your duennas.
Just because my duennas are poor sailors...
...that's no reason for me to be a prisoner in a cell.
Come down from aloft!
A beautiful day.
I addressed you, señor.
You're a man of words, I'm told.
But only when you utter them.
- When others speak to you--
- Stop it!
- How dare you.
- Thirty-two!
Thirty-two!
What did you say about my being a man of words?
- What are you doing?
- Timing the ship's speed by pulse beats...
...against a cork dropped from the bow.
That's something I could never do.
I don't think I even have a pulse.
I'll find it for you.
Fast. Much too fast for navigation.
Señor, you're holding my hand.
You are holding mine.
And it's a beautiful day and you are somebody's serving maid, and why not?
I might have known you'd be without manners, not know your place.
After all, a Hollander. Hollanders are worse pirates than the English.
If I had my way, your ships would be sunk at sight.
They are sunk at sight.
Armed pirate or helpless voyager, it makes no difference to a Spaniard.
And if the touch of Holland is so distasteful to you...
...why do you wear Brabant lace?
- What happened?
- He put hands on me.
Why is he permitted here?
A Dutch navigator working his way to Cartagena.
You dare to put hands on the daughter of a viceroy of Mexico?
If the daughter of the viceroy of Mexico says so.
Master-at-arms, take him in charge and hang him.
Wait.
I would not like a corpse dangling beneath my wedding bell.
I think, capitán, it will be enough to....
- To have him whipped.
- Then whip him.
Seize him to the foremast!
Sound battle stations!
Prepare for battle. Open the gun ports.
Hands to the braces!
The cleverest and most daring cutthroat in all the Caribbeans.
We know him only by the name of his ship, the Barracuda.
There ought to be some nice pickings on that one, sir.
Too sweet a ship for a black-hearted pirate.
If you'd like to watch it through the spyglass.
I would as soon forego the pleasure of admiring it.
He can do nothing to us or our companion ship behind us.
It's death for him to come within range of our guns, and he knows it.
His showing himself at all is merely insolence.
If you're sure that's his own opinion, as well as yours.
While this galleon can steer,
I'd like to see him try it.
Larboard your helm.
- Larboard!
- Helm a-larboard.
Trim your yards! Slack the lee-sheets!
Hands to the braces!
Starboard guns fire.
Starboard guns fire!
He's trying to get away! Fire like crazy!
Not now. Later.
Fire!
Reload!
Quickly, Lupita, help me get him down.
Oh, how could they?
- Water.
- Water, Lupita.
Fire!
How could they leave him up there to die in the hot sun?
See what fair skin he has.
Imagine that wretched captain spoke of hanging him.
As if men like this grew on every bush.
On any bush.
Hello.
Let go of her, you brute! Let go!
Let me go, let me go!
Let go of me, you brute! Put me down!
On my word of honor as the daughter of a grandee of Spain...
...you'll hang this time.
Put me down!
If I had my way, you'd hang every day for a week.
Call the guard!
Put me down! Put me down!
Let go of me, you brute! Let me go!
Swaine, to the whipstaff.
Fire!
Coming through.
Tie it off.
Come on, follow me.
Spare these women violence, or suffer the curse of the Holy Church...
...in flesh and in spirit, in life and death, on Earth, and in hell, forever.
Well, what do you think of that?
My father is the viceroy of Mexico.
And I am Condesa Francisca de Guzman y Angandora.
Well, that sound like a lot of wench, doesn't it?
Where is your leader?
Where is this Barracuda?
I demand to speak to him.
He's on deck. Here.
What did you say your name was?
Francisca de Gutzman de what?
You will disturb nothing until I have spoken to him.
Believe me, he will then tell you that you have made a great mistake.
No....
Well, high and mighty, ain't she?
I wish to be taken to your leader.
Bring it up! Bring it all the way up.
Which one is the Barracuda?
Come on, hey, come on.
Come on, take it up there.
Are you the scoundrel who calls himself the Barracuda?
Alas, no.
I am Capitán Mario da Bilar, at your service, señorita.
If you're looking for the Barracuda....
Halt, hold it!
Permit me.
Stand by to abandon ship!
Permit me, señorita, to present to you my master, Señor Barracuda.
My betrothed is the viceroy of New Granada.
I know. I've known him for some time.
If it takes every galleon on the Spanish Main...
...to bring you to execution, he will.
Perhaps.
Hey, Mario, there will be another ship...
...the San Pablo, along in a couple of hours.
Your head will be our wedding gift to the world.
Put 50,000 pieces of eight from my share of loot...
...into the common fund for the others.
I'll take this woman for myself.
Laurent, no woman is worth such a sum.
That's true, but she happens to be more than just a woman to me.
She's a score that has needed settling.
- You're out of your mind.
- No compliments, please.
Do you think she'll stand the rough weather, my captain?
If you have a desire to--
And add the value of the silver bell on the masthead.
It's a wedding bell. I want that too.
An odd world, da Bilar.
- An odd world truly.
- Let me go!
One never knows when one's going to be married.
Put me down! Let me go!
Put me down!
Here, what kind of bilge water is this?
That's what the grandees drink.
It's Canary wine.
Well, I'm no wine-drinking canary.
Give me rum.
Take it away!
Heave-ho!
- Lively, men, lively!
- Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
- Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
- Courage, my child.
Heave-ho!
There's not enough of her for 50,000 pieces of eight.
My friends, I'll be honored to have you one and all to dance at my wedding!
And when is this wedding to take place, Laurent?
At my leisure. Don't let me frighten you.
I promise you at least one hour's notice.
There is nothing in this whole wide world could ever make me marry you.
You will accompany me to my cabin.
I assume that you have no immediate marriage plans for my duennas.
No.
See that the ladies get safely to their cabins.
If you please.
Or if you don't please.
Clear decks for action!
Prisoners below!
All aboard!
Cast off!
If you will please proceed.
What are these preparations?
What is the meaning of this?
The condensa has forgotten there is a companion ship to the Santa Madre.
The San Pablo is in sight.
The San Pablo? More death and bloodshed. You can't--
Hurry, if you wish to avoid the sight of more death and bloodshed.
- Señor Barracuda.
- What is it now?
- I propose to make a bargain with you.
- Indeed?
You shall have my hand in marriage.
Your hand in marriage?
What are you going to do with the San Pablo?
Well, we try, but it's almost impossible to think up anything new.
Take over. Hold her close to the wind and keep an eye on the San Pablo.
Evans, Wallace, man the tiller.
Hold her close to the wind.
I will marry you if the San Pablo is allowed to proceed unharmed.
So that's it.
Has it occurred to you that your hand in marriage...
...and the San Pablo are mine?
But you don't understand.
A genuine wedding, a proper wedding.
I will have the Lord Bishop himself perform the ceremony.
Pillory, hoist the silver bell to the masthead.
But the San Pablo, captain.
She be the easiest victim we ever had.
San Pablo will proceed unharmed.
Your attention please, Your Lordship.
I propose to be married to this lady immediately.
As soon as Your Lordship can robe himself.
What?
I will profane no sacrament.
- Be not afraid, my child.
- But I wish to be.
If there has been any coercion, if it's not of your own free will....
It is of my own free will.
I wish to be married to this man,
Señor Obispo, at once.
Take His Lordship and his gear to the fo'c's'le, Swaine.
And you, go to my cabin with your mistress.
And get her into the wedding gown.
I'll do nothing that you say, you pig.
You beast, you pig, you swine, you brute! You put me down!
Your Highness, will you walk or ride?
Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband...
...to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony?
Wilt thou obey him and serve him, love, honor, and keep him...
...in sickness and in health?
And forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him...
...so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
Why are you still dressed?
I told you to be in bed.
Brabant lace.
You will put that on.
Believe me, you will.
I'm very pleased with myself.
As my wife, I'm sure you share your husband's delight...
..in what a wonderful fellow he is.
It's always an achievement to strip
Alvarado of as much gold as I have.
And to sink as many of his ships as I have.
But now, at last,
I've deprived him of his bride.
Is that why you married me, señor?
Perhaps. Perhaps because of the whipping I took on your account.
Or I might even be in love with you.
That's not too unbelievable, is it?
Or is it?
Anyway...
...whatever the reason,
I have taken you for my wife...
...and my wife you are going to be.
Was this intended for yourself or for me?
I meant it for you.
But I see now, I have no need of it.
There's nothing you can really do to me.
Neither your touch...
...nor anything you say can be of any consequence.
After all...
...I have been taught never to mind dogs or peasants.
If you're completely finished with your declaration of love, Your Highness...
...you will put that on.
Put that on, or I'll throw you to the crew without it.
Fifty thousand pieces of eight.
Are you really worth
50,000 pieces of eight?
And what am I getting in return?
Francisca de Guzman y Angandora...
...bearer of one of the proudest Spanish names.
Spoiled in the cradle, taught to be useless and selfish and arrogant.
Schooled in cruelty and stubborn pride...
...and cursed with an uncommonly vile temper...
...which you probably perfected yourself.
No.
No, you are no bargain.
On the other hand...
...there may be some assets
I'm not taking into account.
If I may make so bold...
...my figure?
Good. It would bring 5000 at the auction in Algiers.
Say four.
My hair?
There is fire in it.
- My eyes?
- Cold. I might even say calculating.
My lips?
Your lips....
They could persuade me that I've made a good bargain.
Anyway, I'm about to begin to count.
If you aren't ready when I count 10....
I am ready.
Good night.
More wine for the señores.
And another slice of roast for His Lordship.
Forgive my wife's absence.
She will learn better manners in time.
If there's anything you lack,
I beg you to ask for it.
Consider yourselves not so much my prisoners but my honored guests.
It would please me if you would recommend my piracy...
...to your friends when you return home.
- And when will that be?
- As soon as your ransoms are paid.
Tomorrow when we put in at Tortuga,
I shall send Alvarado the reckoning.
In due course, the money will arrive and you will be free to go.
And what will become of the Condesa Francisca?
She will remain my wife.
Excuse me.
Close that door.
Don't you dare come in here while I'm trying to fix my hair.
There are habits of the nobility,
Laurent...
...to which one must accustom one's self.
Under no circumstances can a lady be expected to do her own hair.
I suggest you send Lupita to her.
I have a better notion, Mario.
You happen to be a barber who was deported for blackmail.
The whole matter can nicely be left in your hands.
There.
Pillory, sell our loot to the merchants or at public auction...
...whichever market seems best.
We meet tonight as usual...
...and as for myself,
I'm going to have a haircut.
Settlement of accounts tonight at the sign of the Turtle.
And them as ain't there, ain't paid.
- A very good day, Benjamin.
- I don't think so.
Your venture was unsuccessful, I take it.
You know, of course,
Laurent took the Santa Madre.
Five thousand a share at the very least.
- And a beautiful bride for himself.
- So I see.
You feel perhaps that Tortuga is no place for a lady of her refinement.
I'm inclined to agree.
Come, Benjamin, let's drink on it.
- Ah, my captain.
- Pillory, is it more than we expected?
The best haul we've ever had, sir.
- Rum. Bring me rum.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Curse these cards.
The Barracuda married the girl, you say?
Why marry her? He's a pirate, ain't he?
Well, it's eccentric behavior.
As a sea lawyer, I pledge you...
...there's nothing in the articles of brotherhood against marriage.
- Just a warning.
- I say rot the Barracuda.
What when the viceroy of New Granada hears about this?
And sends 20 galleons, and an army or two armies to get his bride back?
Do you think he'd send all that force for one girl?
That's out of a bottle, Benjy.
No, that's one thing that Benjamin's right about.
I heard it myself.
I'm a pirate, not a womanizer.
I sail the seas.
I grab a Spaniard's treasure or his ship, wherever I find it.
Then I sell it back to them.
I take my chances.
But I see no reason why I should take the Barracuda's chances for him.
What difference, anyway, if we can kill twice as many of them first?
- We're not afraid of them.
- The Barracuda's using us!
To pay off on a private feud.
I say, clear them both out of here together.
Him and his high-born wench both.
Before it's too late.
What's the law on it, Jonas?
Well, according to the articles...
...a captain's privileged to do with his prize any which way he so pleases.
That's on the one hand.
On the other hand...
...prisoners taken at sea are usually sent home in good condition.
And earn you more than their weight in ransoms.
That's on the other hand. So--
He'll send her back to Cartagena or I'll--
That's for the brotherhood to decide,
Benjamin.
Governor, you're in the Barracuda's chair.
Come on, give over, will you?
Rip me if it's not the Barracuda.
Well, where is it?
- Sorry, I didn't bring one this trip.
- No lace nightgown?
Laurent, you worthless dog.
Who's been keeping his feet warm?
What's this?
May I present my friend, Anne Bonny.
This is my wife, Anne.
Your wife?
He says it's his wife.
The Lord Bishop himself married us under a silver bell on the Barracuda.
What did he do, catch you in the cable tier and marry you over a pistol?
Is this true?
Yes.
You Dutch codfish!
If there was a drop of honest blood in you, I'd let it out at your throat.
All these months I've known you....
If I'd thought you'd ever heard of the word marriage.
And marriage to that!
A powdered, prissy trollop.
Broad in the beam.
Soft in the chest.
Let's look at your teeth.
Say your prayers, my pretty.
- Drop it.
- I have no need of your protection.
And certainly not against her.
As if any of your kind had the courage to fight your own battles.
No, you wouldn't. You're the nobility hiding behind your paid protection.
If you've got guts, say the word,
I'll slit you like a pigeon--
I'm sure you'd much rather fight pigeons, Mistress Bonny.
Would you stand before me the length of that table with pistols in our hands?
I've a mind to and the heart to, you poppet.
That's enough.
What do you say, Jonas Salter?
Am I to be struck by his doxy without satisfaction?
Get satisfaction from me, if you want.
According to the orders and articles of the brotherhood of the coast...
...parties striking each other is to be armed and set ashore for 30 minutes...
...without interference from no others.
So be it. We'll do it by the articles, without interference.
Not so fast, Benjamin.
This will be no duel, it would be murder.
Have you ever fired a pistol?
No.
Francisca, your honor will be no good to you when you are dead.
Shake hands with Anne, drink with us and be friends.
Anne, for my sake, forgive her.
Does she crawl and beg me to?
- No.
- You're exceeding your limits.
You heard what Jonas Salter said.
Without interference from no others.
You're right.
It will be as they wish.
Your pistol, Raveneau.
And yours, Captain Spralin.
I will load them equally.
Bless you.
Steady.
Think, Laurent.
What chance will your wife have?
The same chance as Anne Bonny.
Your pigeon has claws, Anne.
Only eagles have claws.
And she's no eagle.
Will you two do without this madness?
No.
Very well, then.
According to the rules, the injured party first.
That's me.
Will either party yield?
Take aim.
I will ask once if you are ready, and then give the word.
Oh, make her hold it steady with both hands.
I don't mind standing fire, but I won't be made a honeycomb of.
- Are you ready?
- Ready, my friend.
Ready.
Fire!
You Dutch codfish.
Chimney soot in the pistols.
I might have known you'd do a trick like this.
That'll teach you not to marry anyone who can't see a joke.
I think you're right, Anne.
Now, if I had chosen you....
The joke seems not to your taste,
Benjamin.
You and your Spanish strumpet.
And what else, Benjamin?
Take her back where she came from.
I'm waiting, Benjamin.
What's your grievance?
Your wife, Dutchman.
She'll have the Spanish Main upon us.
We want no more of her or you.
Does this scum speak for the brotherhood?
Are you my jury? Have I been tried?
The articles say any man who asks a hearing--
You'll hear me anyway.
What's my offense, truly?
Let me tell you.
It is that I hate the tyrant with all my breath and spirit.
In Cartagena long ago, I took an oath...
...to pry his fingers loose as far as one man might...
...until he lost his grasp.
So that others coming after me might find in the New World...
...what I had sought.
Well, the Spaniard begins to feel us now.
His ships go armed and still he loses them.
We even have to find ways now to coax him out to fight.
She will bring Alvarado out.
And I'll be ready for him.
And if that's the crime Captain
Black sees fit to charge me with...
...I plead guilty.
Guilty in the highest degree.
- Laurent!
- No!
Your teeth are chattering, Benjamin.
Are you afraid?
You can have your life for what it's worth.
But get out of Tortuga before the morning.
I warn you.
Gangway, my bullies!
- Who is it?
- Your husband, remember?
I felt there was something
I ought to say to you.
But I'm a little afraid you will misunderstand.
You've told me that I was brought up simply to be an ornament.
You couldn't expect an ornament to understand.
That's just it.
- You are an ornament.
- Thank you.
I admired you at the Sea Turtle tonight.
You had dignity, a sense of fitness, courage.
And?
And I was proud of you.
The Señor Barracuda is very gracious.
You're not to be sarcastic about everything I say to you.
You mean that occasionally, you say what you mean?
Genuinely mean?
I have a suggestion.
Let us both be genuine with each other.
About the Sea Turtle....
I might have been offended tonight if I had been your wife.
But after all, that woman, that--
That-- What's her name?
You know her name.
Very well.
Anne Bonny.
You put the soot in the pistols to protect her as well.
Anne was my dearest friend.
She was all I had until I met you.
I don't know what purpose you could have in telling me that.
Unless you really mean it.
I do mean it.
Please....
Please don't make me believe you again.
Last night when you left me here...
...you didn't mean it then.
You couldn't have.
Why did you leave?
If you had stayed....
When I captured the Santa Madre and you...
...and decided to marry you...
...I wasn't sure whether
I did it out of contempt...
...for revenge against Alvarado.
But now I know.
I want you to be my wife.
Really my wife.
- Laurent.
- Yes?
Why?
Tell me, why?
Careful, you scum.
What are you doing?
And you, Dutchman, tell your bride goodbye.
She's off to Cartagena on the turn of the tide.
My dear captain, you must forgive me.
What I do is not for my own choice...
..but for your own good, and in the name of the brotherhood.
Mario is sailing your ship.
Anne Bonny is in charge of your wife.
And you're staying here in Tortuga, whether you like it or not.
- Laurent.
- That's enough.
Stop the wench.
I'm beginning to think the Spanish witch had a spell on you.
Soak me if I don't believe it's that nightgown.
Take him ashore.
Loose the foretopsail.
We'll fire a cannon when we're clear of the harbor.
Then cut him loose and run for it.
Shove off.
Anchor up. The bow is clear.
Here comes the Barracuda.
Get the crew aboard The Cobra.
- We sail in an hour.
- Aye.
Be careful, Señor Barracuda.
We wish no harm to befall you.
I shall remember your thoughtfulness,
Raveneau.
And you will remember it too, to the end of your days.
- I'll take over from here, de Lussan.
- What do you want?
Him. Just leave the two of us alone and he'll trouble you no more.
You've been drinking too much.
There'll be no murder here as long as Laurent's in my charge.
Now, put down that pistol, or I'll--
Hold it, Dutchman.
You're a very brave man, Benjy, aren't you?
I don't think I'll dirty my steel on you.
Swaine!
Strike me if it ain't the spitting image of the Barracuda.
We had sure a fight.
The Barracuda, he's dead as he ought to be.
Quick, Pillory, untie me.
Why, it is the Barracuda.
Yeah, it's the Barracuda.
Are you hurt, Swaine?
He means that he can handle a dozen like Black any time you say.
Hey, what's that?
That's the signal that da Bilar got clean away...
...with my wife and my ship.
You really mean to say that he stole your wife and your ship?
That's truly accommodating of Benjy.
To leave his ship where we need it at the time we need it most.
Oh, the Cobra will never overhaul the Barracuda.
She can get us to Cartagena.
And that is all I need.
And I would have used my power and freed you even before this.
But such tropical fruit as ours...
...they must be eaten immediately when picked...
...or else they become worthless.
He did her no harm, did he?
Apparently not, Your Excellency.
Murderous words, My Lord Bishop.
I prefer to believe I heard you say,
"indubitably not."
The Condesa Francisca de Guzman y Angandora.
Welcome to Cartagena.
His Excellency the Lord Bishop has informed us of your capture...
...and of your grave trials and tribulations.
Why didn't you tell me she was beautiful?
I did, Your Excellency.
Well, why didn't you tell me she is more beautiful than you did?
I have also been informed, my child...
...of an alleged marriage between yourself and this Barracuda.
Well, obviously,
I hold it to be no marriage at all.
And what I hold anything not to be automatically becomes.
To begin with, any man who adopts the nom de plume of a fish.
It is always possible to petition to have the marriage annulled.
But that would take months, wouldn't it?
On the average, about 18.
Eighteen months?
I refuse to wait like a beggar with my hat in my hand for 18 months.
My dear child, there is no reason why we shouldn't be married tomorrow.
Tomorrow, Your Excellency?
Well, yesterday, unfortunately is impossible.
Today? Today I will be devoting all of my attention to the task...
...of making myself even more personable for you.
But tomorrow,
I have the entire day free.
We shall be married tomorrow.
But a girl has so many things to consider, Your Excellency.
Suppose I were to find myself with two husbands?
A pirate can never be regarded as a husband...
...except maybe by another pirate.
And now, Condesa Francisca,
I beg your leave.
I will attend to all arrangements for the wedding feast...
...and the banquet myself.
Besides, I have matters of state...
...papers to sign, people to be hanged...
...who cannot be hanged without my signature.
I will be back shortly.
Come along.
We'll make a beautiful couple.
You told me he was a man of noble bearing.
He was a man of noble--
Oh, yes, I did, didn't I?
Well, he's not. He's fat.
Can't you regard him as just pleasingly plump?
My poor Lord Bishop.
My child, you're a bad influence.
I was to have signed authorizations for several people to be hanged.
Instead, I became soft.
So I instructed they be turned on the rack instead.
Well, is my little bride all a-flutter?
Out of respect for the condesa's feelings...
...I must counsel that she return home.
And your marriage to her be postponed.
I am sure your advice is sound.
However, I will ignore it.
Commandante, in the future...
...we will apply the word "beautiful" to all the ladies...
...who have previously appeared on these premises.
You will now invent a new word...
...meaning much more than beautiful...
...which will be applied exclusively to la Condesa Francisca.
Eighteen months.
It's absurd.
If I may remind Your Excellency,
I have made my decision.
I am returning home to my father.
You are in error. We will not discuss it.
I insist on returning home.
It is always a mistake to insist upon a decision...
...one is powerless to enforce.
After all, it was also your father's wish that you and I be married.
I will continue to assume it is your true wish as well.
And what have you done with the pirates...
...who brought His Lordship and la condesa?
They are still aboard the ship.
I desire to see them.
I will honor them with my personal attention at once.
Pray, excuse me, my child.
And you, Your Lordship.
Your Excellency...
...I will accompany you.
You are already acquiring a taste for my company.
Good.
By all means, come along.
So this is the Barracuda.
I fancy her as well as any of our own armada.
- Perhaps better.
- I agree, Your Excellency.
With some alteration, it would make a good ship of war.
The elimination of Señor Barracuda alone is alteration enough...
...to convert her into what I really need.
A vessel for my private pleasure.
Don't be surprised, my dear...
...if some fine evening she puts out to sea...
...carrying you on your honeymoon in the arms of your beloved.
If my reference to "your beloved" is vague...
...I refer to myself.
Bless me, it's a woman.
So I am, hogshead. But what are you?
I'm the one who must decide whether you hang or burn at the stake.
It's a difficult choice.
I promised them safe-conduct back to Tortuga.
You did?
Oh, well, I probably would have done the same thing.
And I wouldn't have kept my word.
I see no earthly reason why I should keep yours.
When I gave these people my word,
I meant it to be kept.
There is no such thing as a word of honor that must be kept...
...as far as this rubbish is concerned.
My word must be kept.
You shall have your way.
These people are to be kept under guard, as light a guard as necessary...
...until a way is found to return them to their fellow pirates.
- Does that satisfy you?
- I have your word for it?
- You have.
- Thank you.
Commandante, you will escort the condesa to the gangway.
Thank you.
You will now take these riffraff, shackled if necessary...
...to the Prison of the Penitentes.
You will keep them there until I decide...
...whether they burn at the stake separately or together.
I should have cut your--
What uncouth language. Take her away.
You bas--!
- Your Excellency.
- Who are you?
Mario da Bilar, of whom you must have heard.
Indeed I have. You shall be hanged.
As a reward for restoring
Your Excellency's bride?
Your Excellency is joking, undoubtedly.
Hanged?
Only by the thumbs.
But the Condesa Francisca pledged me that....
It will be a worthwhile experience to learn...
...that no one as lowborn as yourself may ever have the presumption...
...to rely upon the word of the daughter of the viceroy.
- Now what?
- I have a report, Your Excellency.
An armed schooner of English build is making her way along the coast.
The Cobra, of course.
And the Barracuda's on board her.
Now, what made me say that?
Señor Barracuda and I, we've had our misunderstandings...
...but he's still my friend.
By your leave, I'd rather be hanged at once than be tempted...
...to betray him upon his arrival here.
My, you're a scoundrel.
What evidence have you that the Barracuda's aboard the Cobra?
- None.
- Then why do you say--?
Because I know him.
It's as I know the sun will rise tomorrow, I know the man.
He'll not rest until he frees the condesa and Anne Bonny.
Or is killed in the attempt.
The latter alternative is the more likely.
And, incidentally, the more satisfactory.
But if you were of any assistance in bringing this Barracuda...
...within the sphere of my benevolent custody...
...you might avoid hanging altogether.
As great a service as that,
Your Excellency, is certainly worth....
- You have conditions to suggest?
- Condesa Francisca promised me...
...50,000 pieces of eight and the Order of the Golden Spur.
There is something almost engaging about your impudence.
All right, 50,000 pieces of eight it shall be.
And the Order of the Golden Spur.
On my honor as an hidalgo of Spain.
I thank Your Excellency.
Now, let me see. The Barracuda will unquestionably come ashore...
...in a cove long used by our men for scouting purposes...
...some leagues along the coast.
Now, if I were to escape your custody....
- That could be arranged, I take it?
- It could.
I would meet him there.
Laurent!
I knew you'd come.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Never in my life have I been so glad to see friends.
You can imagine my feelings when I tell you...
...less than three hours ago,
I lay in a cell, condemned to torture.
If it hadn't been for the assistance of an officer...
...whom I'd known in happier days and had helped....
If I can be of any service to you,
Laurent.
Laurent, surely you believe me.
You stole my ship.
I only acted in name of the brotherhood, your interest and none other.
We realized that we were losing you...
...that you were becoming unfaithful to our common cause.
You hear what I hear, don't you?
I was untrue to the cause.
Let me finish him off.
You were saying, Mario?
If I die for saying it, it was your wife who betrayed us all.
What of my wife?
From the moment you met her, even when she was saying she loved you...
...she was scheming and contriving to get us to free her from you.
Finally, we consented.
Not for her sake, for yours.
Go on.
She promised us all safe-conduct back to Tortuga...
...after we brought her here to marry Alvarado.
Well?
Anne Bonny and all your crew are now rotting...
...in the dungeons of the Penitentes...
...sentenced to burn at the stake.
That's how much you can trust her.
- Do you realize what you've told me?
- Fully.
Apparently, she couldn't wait for the wedding...
...before moving into His Excellency's palace.
In his palace?
Under the same roof?
Forgive me, Mario, for not trusting you at first.
I thank you for your information.
Get more of it, if you can...
...and meet me tonight in the marketplace when it grows dark.
You can rely on me.
Here, how can you believe him?
- Who tells you I do?
- He's such a liar.
If he bids me good morning,
I figure it's night.
- Every word he says--
- Not every word.
Some are true, and some are not, a kind of hash.
But I won't swallow it before I find out what it's made of.
- Find out where, from her?
- You'd be put in prison.
Not the worst place to be.
That's where our true friends are.
Something tells me that they'd be awfully glad to welcome us.
Come along.
Your Excellency. Capitán Mario da Bilar.
Send him in.
So you've returned already, have you?
Oh, dear, I seem to know less about scoundrels than I thought.
Surely, Your Excellency never doubted me.
Not at all.
I took it for granted you would betray me if you could.
- Well, have you been successful?
- Your Excellency shall be the judge.
I've just met a man of consequence, of genuine--
Oh, come to the point.
I brought up a topic to which no man is ever insensitive.
A lady with whom he's in love.
I intimated she might possibly not be in love with him.
In fact, that she might even be making a fool of him.
- You're shrewder than I thought.
- Oh, Your Excellency.
It was not intended to be a compliment.
I promised you 10,000 pieces of eight.
Fifty thousand was the sum you mentioned.
Fifty was the sum I mentioned but 10,000 was what I had in mind.
Whatever Your Excellency says.
Exactly.
It would by my assumption that vanity would lead this person to investigate...
...whether he has or has not been made a fool of.
For example, if you were in his place, Your Excellency.
If I were in his position. Yes.
I think I would call upon the lady.
Laurent.
I'm sorry if I've startled you.
There was too little time, too much danger...
...to have myself announced with more formality.
Wait. Let me close the door.
You must not stay here.
If you were discovered, don't you know what they'd do?
You were mad to come here.
There is safety in that kind of madness.
Who would ever suspect
I would come here?
Unless you intend to send for Alvarado.
Oh, Laurent, be serious.
Why don't you kiss me?
You would like to continue with this farce, wouldn't you?
What are you talking about?
When I think how I believed in you...
...believed that a lady of your world could possibly stoop to a buccaneer.
I won't listen to you.
All the time you let me believe you loved me.
You were scheming to leave me.
What makes you say such a thing?
What proof have you?
- When I left you in Tortuga--
- The only proof I have is within myself.
In my heart.
The first time we met, you had me lashed.
Because I had the insolence to speak to you.
The dagger you were ready to stab me with.
That was your real self.
When you thought it was safer to play up to me--
That night in the cabin, in Tortuga,
I tried to explain to you.
These things you're saying, they're not true, they're half-truths.
Things that may once have been so.
But have not been so since
I realized how....
How much I do love you.
Well, what are your proofs that you love me?
I wish there were some proofs
I could give you.
Unless you're prepared to believe what I say just because I say it....
I have no proofs.
You've had my crew thrown into the prison.
Anne Bonny, to whom you promised safe-conduct home...
...she's under lock and key, waiting with the rest to be burned...
...in celebration of the royal holiday.
Anne Bonny and your crew?
I'm sure the flames will add a bit of color to the festivities connected--
- Call the guard.
- With your next marriage.
Laurent, you must go. You've got to go.
I take it you know the palace guard is coming.
I swear to you I didn't.
Please, you must go.
Now that it is too late to be of any use, you warn me.
But I too had conceived such a possibility myself.
So you're the Barracuda?
Or Laurent Van Horn, remember?
Yes, I remember. You were presumptuous and I punished you.
Oh, we're old friends.
But it's an intimacy that won't endure much longer, I'm afraid.
I will rid you of this intruder immediately and permanently.
Tell him the truth about Anne Bonny.
You've got to know, you--
I still consider it a delightful privilege to have known you.
And I shall remember you to the end of my days.
What a pretty speech.
Search the garden.
You, look in the shrubbery to the right.
Remember, get the weapons to me in the prison as you did in Maracaibo.
I count on you.
Make sure there are no more of them.
A thousand pardons for this intrusion, my child.
But I thought it necessary, for your sake even more than my own.
Let me open you another bottle.
Not now.
What if someone saw us?
Take them the basket and hurry back here.
I'll be waiting for you.
Here is your last meal.
Don't choke on the bones.
Did you hear? The last meal.
What did he say?
He said he doesn't care.
It's the viceroy.
I should have left here long ago.
If he finds you here in your condition with me, his favorite....
I know, it would be my last meal too.
Strike me if I'd ever thought
I'd see you again.
Francisca. She's here.
She knows the way to a man's heart.
Put it out of sight.
On second thought,
I'd rather wear the white brocade.
It flatters my figure.
Mind you, my dear Escobar...
...this visit of mine is not meant to reflect...
...on the way you run this prison.
I find that my appearance now and then keeps people on their toes.
I think you'll find everything to your liking.
Oh, be careful of the steps,
Your Excellency.
Don't forget to tell my barber my beard wants trimming.
Yes, Your Excellency.
You let any man come that close to your throat with a blade?
Coco, tell the man that I do.
He shouldn't have thought he could steal a woman...
...the way he stole ships, goods and riches.
For the first time, we see eye to eye.
A woman cannot be stolen, nor her love.
Hang him high.
High enough for him to have a last glimpse of the Barracuda.
A crowning touch, that.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Note that the wedding party...
...will be on the same barge with the priests.
And let him and his party reach their destination first.
Da Bilar. What a pretty sight.
Now hiding behind
His Excellency's rather broad back.
What a pity that one of the few comparable swordsmen...
...should be reduced to parrying with words.
Even if I had something more pointed than words...
...I would not use it now.
Well, Coco, since we shan't see him again...
...our condolences.
He mustn't see me.
I didn't know your kind cared about their men as much as we do.
I love him.
I came here to keep my word that all of you would go free.
You come now, please.
Well, strike me.
- You....
- Walk ahead of me.
- My wife.
- Come on, open up.
- Do you believe me now?
- Yes.
I'll never forget these seconds.
I'll never forget the way you look now.
Hey, stow it.
You'll have the guards on our necks.
You, where's the armory?
Come on. Step lively.
- Come on, hurry.
- Gangway!
I'm sure you're wrong.
They reported that the palace sent a maidservant.
I'm telling you the palace sent no maidservant.
There's some girl here. It would be well to find out about her...
...and for you to see that she doesn't slip past the gates.
I'll see to it.
Hard as I try, I cannot believe this is your bridal gown.
Of course, there's time for you to change...
...and take your place on the barge.
I think, I'm sure you'll agree...
...that the less said about this to Alvarado, the better.
Well, Mario, at last.
Oh, Laurent.
You dirty bilge rat.
Make for the harbor.
Avoid the fortress, it bristles with soldiers.
Come on, me bullies.
Head him for the Carolinas.
From there...
...good sailing.
- Do you see the boat?
- I see nothing, sir.
Don't look at me, you won't find it in my face. Look out there.
- Yes, sir.
- And keep on looking.
Why are you putting those pillows on deck?
Do you think we wish to spend the night? Idiot.
- Take them below.
- Yes, Your Excellency.
Here, take them below. Quick.
I will enjoy that tomorrow morning at breakfast.
More soldiers? What are they for?
There has been an uprising.
- The pirates are at large.
- What?
These men were sent to protect you now that you are to return ashore.
Return ashore?
Their leader has no ship but this.
I'll wait for him here.
Are there more of you?
They are waiting alongside.
Send them up.
With those aboard, they will be an adequate committee of reception.
The boat is coming.
- Shall I signal it to turn back?
- Not at all.
The condesa should acquaint herself with the way I deal with men who cross me.
The good fathers will be unaware that their robes are missing until they wake.
And, believe me,
Pillory used no violence.
But I'm afraid the Lord Bishop himself may be expected.
If so, His Lordship's absence may have to be excused.
Officer, form a guard of honor to receive the condesa.
And put down the carpet.
My dear.
Father Lorenzo is deputizing for His Lordship.
The bishop is confined with another attack of gout.
I pity him, while I rejoice that he caused me no delay.
And I fancied we'd be married right here.
I take it for granted you agree.
I must make mention of an unforeseen delay.
You are not yet, as scheduled, a widow.
We shall therefore have to restrain our impatience...
...not for weeks, nor days, nor even hours, I hope.
Don't hope.
I should have said it will be only a matter of minutes.
Because this ship is amply fortified.
Which I'm sure you didn't anticipate.
I indulge myself in the thought...
...that you were unwillingly persuaded into this intrigue.
It was of my own choosing.
You chose the loser and I permit you to change your mind.
I have no intention of changing my mind.
Don't try my affection too far.
I'm not one of your kind anymore.
No matter what you do to me,
I never will share your triumph.
Lieutenant.
Call your guards. They can't make me despise you any less.
You, who stand for everything I wish to forget.
Lieutenant.
Where are you?
Sentry.
Sentry.
Sentry!
Cut the anchor cable. Set topsails.
We can't sail past the fortress, sir.
The channel lies in point-blank range.
It's time we made a run for it.
You fools.
You'll never clear the harbor.
The garrison is under my personal instruction to fire...
...if this ship so much as moves before daybreak.
Sound the alarm. Man your guns.
Sound the alarm!
At least we all may have the dubious consolation of dying together.
Man your guns.
The Barracuda.
She sails long before her time, sir.
The priest. The bride.
His Excellency.
Is there any reason he shouldn't be married ahead of time?
Look carefully at the priest, sir.
Isn't he rather tall for the bishop?
Yes, strangely tall, I grant you.
Stand ready to fire by sections.
Stand ready to fire by sections.
Fire.
Why don't you fire?
Section number three, independent fire.
It will be moments now.
Close your eyes and pray that we will be delivered.
And to think that I should have considered firing on her...
...with His Excellency on board.
Give them the rockets for good luck.
Long live the viceroy.
- Let's hang him from the yardarm.
- String him up.
- Cut out his heart.
- No, no, we gotta do this proper.
Step by step. Limb from limb.
Can't you let him live somehow?
Find a way for him to do some useful work?
Work? No, condesa.
Yours is the cruelest of all suggestions.
Lucky Don Juan Alvarado.
I knew he wouldn't wait.
He's dead.
[ENGLISH]
The Canadian Northwest.
Here the first traders from the Old World intermarried with the lndians of the plains and forests to found a new race: the Metis of Canada.
Here, for two centuries these half-breed hunters and trappers multiplied and prospered a law unto themselves.
Then surveyors and homebuilders pushed westward bringing laws of land and property which threatened to end forever the free ways of the wild trails. ln 1885, resentful and confused, the half-breeds, under the leadership of Louis Riel, revolted against the advance of unwelcome law. ln that hour, a handful of hard riding men in scarlet coats, the Northwest Mounted Police, stood between Canada's destiny and the rebellion that was being kindled across the American border in a little Montana school house.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Thy banners make tyranny tremble.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Thy banners make tyranny tremble.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Susie, you didn't sing the last words. l got scared, Mr. Riel.
He kind of looks like the big bad robber in the picture books. l'm going to let you all go home early today children.
- School dismissed!
- Bye, Mr. Riel!
Susie! Come here.
There's nothing to frighten you.
These are old friends from Canada.
Get the kid out!
Time is short.
-Run along. Don't imagine things.
-Alright. l'll sing good tomorrow.
You're not gonna be here tomorrow. l got your message, Duroc.
Returning to Canada is death.
For some maybe, not for us.
15 years of exile haven't changed you Corbeau.
Or you... l hope.
Canada change plenty. No more she belong to the half-breed.
The law come on the old trails, white people steal the land, the surveyor tell us where we got to live.
We send plenty letter to government.
She is too busy to listen.
Government take care of lndians, take care of white settler.
Ain't nobody take care of the half-breed people.
No half-breed gonna take care of himself.
She's gonna fight by Jove.
You gotta come back, and lead us.
-Against the Queen's soldiers?
-Yes.
-We tried that once.
-This time it will be different.
The lndians are in grand council.
More Black Feet and Cree than anybody ever saw before.
They'll join us if l say so, and fight. l got Cree blood, same as Big Bear.
-The lndian government...
-What? You and me, and Duroc, we will be the government.
With the lndians, we'll wipe the whites out of Western Canada.
We'll set up a new government.
Batoche gonna be our capital.
Half-breeds coming there by hundreds from the river and woods,...
-They still believe in me...
-Yeah.
You know what happens if we fail again?
We don't fail!
Corbeau's got something.
You've never seen a gun like that.
She squirt lead like a hurricane.
Trust Corbeau to know the newest way of killing.
-My gun shoots 1000 slugs a minute.
-lmpossible.
A Gatling gun stole near the border.
-Blood.
-Put on the dunce cap.
-l go fight alone. Come on!
-No! l will never let you lead my people.
You can be the saint that leads them Louis.
All l want is the whiskey business.
And l'll get it.
Or you'll get no help from the lndians. l don't want no help from a whiskey trader.
-You...!
-Corbeau!
Louis, if he don't get the Cree and Black Feet to fight those redcoats with us, we go smash.
And the half-breeds, they don't fight without Louis.
So maybe you don't like each other but you need each other very much.
Blood will run like water.
Blood? You won't notice it much.
The mounted police wear red coats.
Looks like bargain day in Batoche.
Trouble... Keep your eyes open and holster closed.
Left turn!
Present arms!
Present the arms!
Soldier, what for you don't do what l say? l go home.
Duroc, he's a go home.
Hey! Why you go home?
''Shoulder arm, hold arm, right, left, right about,...''
He change his mind too much. l go home.
Go home? Get back.
All you men obey the order.
-Come here!
-Red coats!
Johnny Pelang, dismiss the men.
Get the paper.
-Good boy.
-Shoulder the arms!
Redcoats coming, we dismiss now.
Go away, but don't leave.
You suppose the inspector's right and Riel is back?
The inspector's always right.
-The fort's 20 miles away.
-Dry up.
-Where did they get those revolvers?
-Santa Claus.
The police.
Cover up quick.
Hello, Freddie Monts.
Pretty heavy lunch box you got there.
She's just a little present for my wife.
Be careful she's not your widow.
-Brave man to give his wife bullets.
-Stow that.
There are men here all the way from the Parsnip. They mean business.
Fort Carlton tonight, same place.
Ronnie. l told you to forget that klootch.
She's poison.
-But Jim l...
-Never trust a blue eyed squaw.
There's the old wolf himself.
Go to hospital and call on your sister. Stay there until l come.
-Don't come on a stretcher.
-Sharp now.
-Hello, Jim.
-Hello, Dan. Quite a crowd.
Sure. Plenty friends of mine.
-ls Louis Riel here yet?
-He is the best friend we got.
Better advise him to go slow.
For 15 years we go slow.
Now we go quick.
We give you 24 hours.
On this paper we write what we want. lf your government say no, we make new government.
You're making a mistake.
-The law is in the Northwest now.
-So is this fellow.
You can't fight the whole
British empire?
50 mounted police, only 50. ln all Canada, only 500.
We got many thousand half-breed.
Big Bear and Crow foot got 10,000 warrior.
The lndians won't follow Riel.
Maybe they follow Jacques Corbeau. lf you bring back that killer you'll deserve what you get.
You're a great old wolf, Duroc. l'd hate to see you hang with that coyote.
-24 hour Jim, we want answer.
-You'll get it, if the wires to Ottawa stay up.
The wires, she'll stay up.
Just 24 hours.
Don't get them tangled around your neck.
-You think Corbeau no come, eh?
-He will if he smells blood.
Maybe he smell blood pretty quick.
Your blood!
Pull him down!
We're gonna fight! lf we want Corbeau, we'll be getting Corbeau.
The redcoat be skinned pretty easy. lf we want Riel, we'll get Riel!
-Didn't Jim ask you to stay here?
-Yes but...
Take your hand off that bridle!
Stand clear.
Let go of that bridle!
Shorty! lt's a boy!
A boy Shorty!
Don't you want to see your son?
A boy! Hang loose!
Out of the way!
My son he ask for see me.
Good for him!
Tod McDuff! l just have baby!
Remarkable.
-Hello, Tod.
-Hey, Jim.
Thanks for keeping Shorty covered, but l'm glad you didn't shoot. l was of a mind too but l was afraid l'd drop a stitch.
She not very big.
How you make sure that's boy?
Black Chief.
That's chief.
Look, Jim. l just got baby boy!
That's a fine papoose. l've got to tell my wife about this.
-Hello, April.
-Hi. l'll have to get Shorty's baby a rattle for that timing.
The baby arrived hours ago.
-Then you get the rattle.
-You rattle me enough as it is.
Hold still Niska.
Roll up my sleeve Ekawe. l will.
How can you deliver a baby, set a broken leg and look lovelier than a Christmas calendar all at once?
You're quite a picture yourself, you'd look good in a golf frame.
-Better in the same frame.
-Let's make it a family album.
Let's water the horses. We must get Duroc's message on the wire.
Right.
When you look at Ronnie even his hair stands to attention.
There's a contrary streak in the Logan breed.
-We just know our own minds.
-You don't know your own heart?
-l don't intent to listen to it.
-You will.
You're leg will be just as straight as sergeant Bret's back.
-Tell you what our plans are...
-Jim! l've been transferred to
Nova Scotia.
Nova Scotia?
What's that's where codfish grow, isn't it?
Orders are orders in my branch of the service too.
Niska! You mustn't eat that.
Your tummy will turn to stone.
Like your heart.
-l just don't understand.
-You'll never understand Jim.
Until something beats you to your knees.
Don't get yourself all over plastered.
-You love me.
-You see?
You don't ask.
You just make statements.
Well, do you love me? l might but l don't want to.
Help me, will you?
You're fine and right for yourself and for the service but
-anyway, l'm leaving.
-Running away?
-l'm no heroine.
-All Anglican nurses are heroines. l don't want to be bravely smiling goodbye to my husband every time he puts down a rebellion or goes on patrol to the North Pole. l just wouldn't let him.
When do you leave?
-Next month.
-We'll see.
Anything in the regulations about you always getting your woman?
No, but there should be. l gave the horses some water.
Have some yourself. l'll be there in a minute. l wish you'd think what it means to us if you leave. l'll have plenty of time to think in Nova Scotia.
Sure. What's time to a codfish?
But l'll track you.
To Nova Scotia, Afghanistan... or anywhere, because l still think we belong in the same frame.
Niska, do you think l'm a fool?
So do l.
You'll make somebody a good wife someday. ln the meantime we'll need you as a Mounted Police scout.
Duroc is my very good friend.
Nearly every night for 30 years we've played pinnacle together.
You can't be on both sides.
McDuff, you don't scout for the Redcoats?
-You don't turn against me.
-My father was a Highlander.
They helped knit the Empire together and l'll have no hand in unraveling it.
The inspector will swear you in at Fort Carlton in the morning Tod.
24 hours Jim.
You and me, like brothers Tod.
Aye, that we are.
But l cannot fight against the Queen.
Flesh of the snake.
Blood of the skunk!
You don't fight with us, maybe you don't fight with nobody. lt would twist my soul to fight against you Dan.
But l cannot fight against the Queen.
-Jerry.
-Yes?
Cover up for me after mess. l've gotta get out.
Next time tell that klootch to bring a friend.
Ottawa can't possibly act on these demands in 24 hours.
B0 atoche will boil over and scald half of Canada.
Rotten business. lf the lndians rise they'll be blood from here to Baffin Bay.
Come on!
Gates closing for the night!
Everybody out.
Civilians outside the stockade!
Get going, Uncle Blue Owl.
-Come on. Come on.
-Hurry it up there.
Hurry it up.
-Where can l find the head man?
-Headquarters over there.
Keep moving. Everyone out.
Hey you!
Who's that? Gabriel?
No civilians allowed in the stockade after retreat, mister.
-You'll have to come back tomorrow.
-Thanks.
Hold him for me, will you soldier?
He's part bull and don't like red.
A man from Texas, sir.
My name's Dusty Rivers sir,
Texas Rangers. l landed up here following a man we're after for murder.
Orderly, tell sergeant Bret l want him.
Yes, sir.
Ranger's commission.
Commissioner's deputy,
United States Marshal and here's my O. K. from your Regina office.
-l've heard of your organization.
-Thanks. We heard of yours too.
Thank you.
You come at rather a difficult time.
Sergeant Bret, this is Mr. Rivers of the Texas Rangers.
Howdy.
Texas did you say?
-Texas, is a United State.
-Yes, sir.
The Rangers are a organization rather like our own in some respects.
Yes, sir.
He's here on a police errand.
See that he's fed, billeted, and offered a bath.
Then help him fill out the proper forms.
Very good, sir.
That's mighty hospitable of you but l want to get started...
This way please.
They say Riel is gonna try it again.
Look out, l'm not Riel. l tried a lot of times l never got anywhere.
-Low bridge there Slim.
-Place wasn't built for a giraffe.
Gentlemen!
This is Mr. Rivers of the Texas constabulary.
-Rangers.
-Hello, constable!
Another criminal has leaked out of the US and he's after him.
You can sleep in that collapsible mantrap, sheriff.
Attention, to roll call.
-Constable Ackroyd.
-Here.
-Adams.
-Cameron.
-Douglass.
-Fyffe.
-Herrick.
-Judson.
-Kent.
-Kennedy.
-On patrol.
-Harder than rock but for your head.
-Lane.
-Logan.
Logan?
He was slightly overheated and went out to get some air.
Ronnie!
-Why you be so late?
-l was put on potato patrol. lf this potato is other woman... l eat your heart out. l was pealing one million potatoes just because l talked to you in Batoche.
Then maybe l don't eat your heart. l just keep him here, inside my heart.
Suits me molasses.
-Here. Want this for a padlock?
-Ronnie!
This lock both our hearts together.
Put it on for me please.
What's that?
Get! lf that wicked sentry finds you your cute little pelt will be nailed to the barn door.
Ronnie, maybe police no let me come Fort no more.
-Why?
-My father, he come back.
Who's your father?
He's very bad medicine. l remember long ago he cooked bear meat on stick give me piece in my hand.
Well l'll tell you what we'll do. l won't bite him if he doesn't bite me.
Please, you don't let my father bust us up!
Listen you little wild cat.
You're the only real thing for me.
Nobody, nothing could ever make me let you go. l love you so terrible bad l feel good. l'll be pealing potatoes the rest of my life for this.
-Douglass, a hand will you?
-Of course.
Mother and child, both doing nicely.
What do you ride in Texas?
Elephants?
They come in handy if you break a wheel on your wagon.
An uncle of mine visited Texas once.
Sir William Wade, perhaps you've met him.
We hung a fellow named Bill Wade.
That probably was not Sir William.
No!
Advise me what time Logan get in.
Good night Sheriff.
Revelly is at six o'clock.
-Re- what?
-Oh Revelly.
You fellows are pretty fancy!
Having ltalian food for breakfast.
Doesn't your organization rise by bugle call?
Sure! We blow Rev...
Oh! You mean Revelry. lt's been waking him up every morning and he can't pronounce it.
Any more than you can eat it.
We'll get your man for you. l was counting on being home by the 4th of July.
-Your birthday?
-No, my Uncle Sam's. lt's an American holiday.
Yeah. The States sort of set up housekeeping for themselves.
After being hatched and protected for 150 years.
-Don't mind him. He reads a lot.
-We stuck to our mother, that's all. lt's a wise child that knows its own mother.
A wiser one that appreciates her.
Good night Sheriff.
Good night.
But l still want to be home by the 4th of July.
Have your saddles ready for marching orders in the morning.
There may be action.
-Lights out. Good night.
-Good night.
Action tomorrow. You hear that?
Look, he's a Redcoat at heart. ls that the Rangers full dress?
Undress.
Very good!
Why do you carry two guns?
One don't shoot far enough.
-l'd like to visit Texas some day.
-You can.
Canadians get over to our country too once in a while. l'm after one of 'em now.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Good night.
That second red river cart looks like it had the mumps.
Wait. l'll talk to them.
-Good afternoon.
-How do you do?
What's in the carts?
-Take a look. lf you want.
-No, you have no warrant.
These aren't ordinary times, mister.
Rare wheels for a red river cart.
Open it up! Come along!
Pull the hide off.
Holy cat! Look at this!
Why did you do that?
We could have taken them prisoner.
There was no need to shed blood.
You're splattered with it too, Louis.
You can't back out now.
Get going!
Advance!
Get up there! Come on!
-Well?
-No word yet sir.
Fur!
Buy from me please.
-You buy these white ermines?
-No!
Buy from me please.
Furs. You buy these pretty white ermines?
What l got here is very fine, very young.
What you got is the oldest thing there is, only the original sale was for an apple not a fur. l no sell this for apple.
Stranger! l wouldn't buy any furs from that Beelzebub!
-She steals them!
-You tell lie!
Somagun Scotch lndian!
-l think l kill you.
-Heathen. l'll take you across my knee and tan your hide.
-l kill you!
-Oh you would!
Let go my hair! Let go! l'll get you for this!
-l'll skin you for this!
-You're gonna get it!
Let me go!
Take her hands off her or l'll beat your teeth out!
Logan!
Tod, report to the OC.
He'll swear you in.
Aye Him. Daughter of Beelzabub, l know how to handle a woman. l told you to keep away from this fort.
Pretty soon you'll no be boss no more.
Get out of here!
Wait a minute!
Where did you get that ring?
What you care?
Logan, l want to talk to you. l warned you about that klootch.
-My personal business is my own.
-She's a thieving little... l ought to wipe your jaw for that.
Don't be a fool.
-lt's because she's part lndian.
-No! Because she's all bad.
You'd lose your eyebrows if l married her, wouldn't you?
-Why?
-Why not?
-l don't see why all this...
-Do you know who she is?
-l know who she's going to be.
-She's Jacques Corbeau's daughter.
Look out! lt's April!
What happened?
Call the hospital orderlies.
Get the doctor!
Put that man out there.
Take this one first.
He's dead.
-Corporal take charge of the body.
-Dr. Roberts. This way sir!
-There's two of them in there.
-Gently, he's badly hurt.
-Who is it?
-l don't know!
Corporal!
Clear these people.
-Come on!
-Let Miss Logan through!
How'd it happen?
Constable Fenton.
-Where did you find him?
-On the Red Berry trail. l was on my way to a case.
How long were they lying there before you found them?
-lt happened just before l got there.
-Did you hear firing?
-Did you see any tracks?
-Some red river cart tracks. l couldn't tell how many horses.
-What Fenton able to say anything?
-He said something about a gun but...
Constable Fenton, what happened?
Wagon train, sir...
Carrying a...
Gatling gun.
-A Gatling gun?
-Somebody running guns to Duroc.
-Did you recognize the men?
-No, sir.
But funny foreign looking saddle.
Fenton, can you describe the saddle?
Did it have a big silver horn?
Biggest l ever saw.
What the boy saw was a Mexican charro saddle.
Probably ridden by the man l'm after, Jacques Corbeau.
Corbeau?
Have the bugle sound boots and saddles.
-Patrol of 20 men.
-Yes, sir.
Good job Miss Logan.
Better stay at the fort.
Batoche is not safe.
Thank you but l have several patients in my hospital. l wish l was one of them...
-Boots and saddles!
-Come on!
No member of the force shall discuss the situation with any civilian, except in being in the regular line of duty.
Alright. Bedrolls and kit bags on the wagons at once!
Don't let the grass grow under you.
Come on!
On the double.
Get 'em out there.
Pick 'em up. They won't bite.
Be sure you put that on the horse Logan.
-One keg of horseshoes.
-Right.
Don't forget the nails this time.
You can't sew them on.
-Right.
-And an extra wagon pole.
-That breaks you'll pull it yourself.
-Right.
One coil of rope.
You boys can sure slap a saddle on pronto.
Come on!
On the double!
Fresh team for you Miss. lnspector's orders.
-Thanks. l can hitch them.
-lf you say so ma'am.
Fall in!
-l'll hook 'em up for you Miss.
-Thank you.
Back up here you lucky horse. lt belongs to the Mounted Police.
-They're pretty good, aren't they?
-They're the best.
-My name's Dusty Rivers.
-lsn't that a contradiction? l expect you've never been to Texas, Miss...
-Miss...?
-April Logan.
-April? You're not fooling?
-No.
Here's your horse, sergeant.
Head 'em out.
Group mount!
Reform ranks!
Eyes right!
Eyes front!
At ease!
Make much of your horses!
April, l'd rather you didn't go back to the town.
Sergeant, what part of the parade do l ride in? l'm sorry, you're not going with us.
-April, with Riel on the warpath.
-l'm sorry too,
-but l am going with you.
-Corbeau is wanted for murder here.
He belongs to the Mounted Police now.
He belongs to whoever catches him first.
Hi, sis'!
Let your brother kiss you goodbye. ln the line Logan. l'll be glad to tend to any unfinished chores for you.
There are some things about you that l don't like.
-You're not exactly perfection.
-This isn't Texas...
Jim! l think l'm capable of deciding who l'll kiss goodbye. l'm not sure that you are.
-You ought to obey him.
-Do you?
-Not always.
-Your judgment's good enough for me.
-Patrol all present, sergeant.
-Very good.
-Patrol ready to march, sir.
-Pick up the trail at the scene. lt'll probably take you to Big Bear's camp.
-Yes sir. March them off.
-Very good sir.
March!
March!
Sections right!
Right!
Wire from Headquarters, sir.
Sergeant Bret!
Patrol halt!
-Dismiss you men, sergeant.
-Beg your pardon, sir?
-Dismiss your men.
-Very good, sir.
-Sergeant Field, take over!
-What the..
Dismiss the patrol.
Sections left about!
-What's up?
-We're staying here.
Not me, amigo. l'm gonna get Corbeau. lf you ride through that gate l'll place you under arrest.
-You can try.
-Sergeant! lnspector's complements: Will you,
Mr. Rivers and McDuff report at once.
Change of orders from Regina.
No patrols to leave until we're reinforced by Colonel lrvine. lt'll take a week. By then Corbeau will have Big Bear on the warpath.
And the Black feet.
-Couldn't you wire Regina?
-No!
The wires were cut two minutes after this came through.
Does the order prohibit sending out a single scout?
No. l'd like your permission to proceed to Big Bear's camp alone
-and try to keep him loyal.
-No! Only a loon would do it. lt's a ticklish job, but permission is granted. l'll leave at once, sir. l'll leave at the same time. l'd be grateful if you'd bind and gag this Texan.
-l'm not going where he is.
-Where do you want to go? l figured to pick up Corbeau in Batoche.
-Why do you think he's there?
-That's Riel's capital, isn't it?
You can't make an arrest in Canada. lf l got to have a nurse... give me the Scotchman.
McDuff, you'll accompany Mr. Rivers.
And gentlemen l hope you keep your scalps.
A nurse, at my time of life...
-Good hunting.
-Thanks.
-Sure you make that fast.
-Alright miss.
Climb aboard McDuff.
-Where are you going?
-Batoche.
-l wish it was 1000 miles.
-Seat's too hard for 20 miles.
Lady, to me it's just like sitting on a cloud.
Get!
-Are you riding with us Jim?
-No. The other way. l'll send you a postcard.
Canada is a lot different from what l expected.
The scenery?
-No, the people.
-Haven't had much time to tell.
Sometimes it strikes you at first sight... l mean...
You can usually figure a man by the way he handles his horse but women are different.
What did you expect
Canadian women to be like?
Like the scenery: good to look at but kind of frostbitten.
But you're not. l've always understood Americans were too busy building, and selling and shooting each other to waste time saying nice things to women.
-We get around to it now and then.
-Must be appreciated by your wife.
-Who's wife?
-Aren't you married? l've always held that a bachelor is a fellow who never makes the same mistake once.
You believe that? l did... until mighty recent.
Do you think a plant from up here would do alright in Texas? l don't know Texas.
Even the moonlight's warm and soft along the Pecos River.
Do you have fast horses in Texas Mr. Rivers?
The fastest in the world.
Betting they cannot keep up with the men?
Look!
-What happened, Mrs. Burns?
-Don't go into Batoche.
-They've looted the Trading Post.
-And driven us from our homes.
-How could Duroc permit it?
-He tried to keep order but... when Corbeau got there...
-Corbeau?
-Yes.
Excuse me, lady.
Enough!
Just one thing more.
Riel can tell you how this new government sets up.
But l'll tell you how it's going to win.
10,000 lndians turn loose on Saskatchewan.
They'll be nobody left to pull down this government when l'm finished.
Canadian woman who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes,
Gentlemen,
Corbeau has promised you the backing of Big Bear.
When Big Bear leads the Cree nation upon the war path the Black Feet will rise with him.
Our fire of wrath will consume its oppressors.
From it will arise, not half-breed, but a free and independent Metis nation.
Don't mind me, mister.
Go right ahead.
Duroc, who is he?
He's officer from United States.
Want talk with Canada Government. l bring him here.
They found out quick.
Hey! l'm a Deputy US Marshal, Mr. Riel
-And...
-You know my name.
Sure! Who don't?
Here's my credentials.
We'd be happy to know if your new government means to work hand in hand with the United States.
The Metis of Canada will be happy to cooperate with the USA.
Suppose some fellow commits a crime in our country then trails up here to hide out.
We'll help you in every way just as we hope you will help us.
That's fine because l got a warrant here for the arrest of a man named Jacques Corbeau.
On a charge of murder.
Gentlemen!
Council is recessed.
Wait here.
That put a bee in Riel's bonnet.
-This bee on your bonnet.
-What's the matter with it?
-My first bullet shoots him off.
-Why you wanna ruin my bonnet?
Just so you know it is me who fires the second shot.
The one that go between your eye. l'll make you a small wager.
50 cents that l put a bullet through your vengeful heart before you shoot the knob from my bonnet. l take that bet and l take the money from your pocket because you'll be dead.
Corbeau.
-There's a US officer here.
-For what?
-You.
-Well?
He wants a warrant from my government for your arrest.
-Why don't you give it to him?
-But we need you for the lndians. ln two hours give him your warrant.
Tell him l'm in Big Bear's camp.
He can arrest me there.
He would never leave that camp alive.
You don't want him killed here, do you Louis?
At an lndian camp, who cares?
Once the Cree warriors were free men.
Canada belonged to you and to us.
Well it's gonna be ours again.
Take the warpath with us.
Fight!
Fight like you used to fight, and not one of these prairie cops will be buried with his scalp on.
Big Bear, that medal you wear is the Queen's.
The great white mother who sent food to you when you starved.
You're too wise to let a liar make bad blood between us.
Men say Queen no longer rule us.
Redcoat no more our friend.
This is our friend that bites with a thousand teeth of fire.
Make gun talk to them.
-lt'll tear it to rags.
-Squaw make new lodge.
A hole in the tent won't change the British Empire.
This man is going to hang. l don't want to see you beside him.
Make gun talk.
Two more strangers. l want his scalp. l know him.
Well you sure found
Corbeau alright.
You're as welcome as a broken leg.
Ahkakito, who these men?
Spies to count your men and horses.
His tongue is forked.
He said he came alone.
This man is no spy.
He comes from afar to take
Corbeau who killed in his nation.
Like Mounted Police want
Corbeau because he has killed here.
Are you afraid of Redcoats?
Their blood spills like other men's.
Look here Chief.
Before you turn that man over to the Mounted Police, l got an order for his arrest not only from the US, but from his own Chief, Riel.
And if you... l'm paid 72 cents a day to protect dummies like him.
Peace.
We got no war with the Redcoat.
Yet. But they no take away my friend.
You both come alone, you both go alone. l have spoken.
Big Bear was a great chief.
His friends will be sorry for him.
Now you die.
You can kill me and take this back but its medicine will be gone.
The great white mother gave you this to let you rule over thousands.
You are not chief unless she gives it back to you.
Big Bear will join his blood brother and fight for Riel.
Go.
Big Bear, you're a great Chief.
Why we heard of you way down in Texas.
But how do you know who's the best fighter?
The Mounted Police or Corbeau, the great killer of men?
-You better get out.
-Rivers.
Peace. Talk.
Why this fellow's killed in Texas, and killed in Canada.
He must be a great gunfighter, but have you ever seen him kill?
How do you know all these yarns are true? l'll show you if they're true.
He offers to show you.
Let him kill now.
Who he kill?
Me.
Another will die.
Slide my guns back in their cradles, untie my hands and l'll hold them out.
Then tell this tough man to go to it.
Cut the thongs.
Put back the guns.
-The man is daft.
-He's great!
Now tell him to kill.
Kill.
Go ahead Corbeau. Draw.
Tell him to draw Big Bear.
He's been bragging about how he's gonna kill? Start on me.
Kill.
Draw you yellow pole cat!
You're a good hand at shooting men in the back. What's wrong now?. l won't foul a great Chief's lodge with the blood of a dog.
He's yapping across the trail, to save his Redcoat friends.
But the medicine gun, she'll roll them all in the dirt. l have not seen this yet.
Then look.
What a thing!
That gun strong medicine.
Shooting painted horses is not killing men.
Before the sun has set three times l'll bring you the Redcoats of the Mounted Police, made redder with their own blood and full of holes like a net.
You're not a feather to be blown about by the talk of a coward.
Bring me in your hand their empty coat red with blood before three suns have set and my braves will take the warpath.
Before three suns have set
Corbeau will wear iron on his hands.
Come on!
Very nice entertainment indeed.
Now if you'll cut me loose l'll endeavor to show my appreciation.
You're alright, Sheriff.
Let's mush.
-l came here to get that fellow.
-l think we'd better move before Corbeau finds out the lndians took the bullets out of your pistols. l won't tell on you.
Come on.
Whatever you did at Big Bear's camp these men have undone.
What else could we do?
Our horses were stolen two nights ago.
You should have blown it up!
Leaving 10,000 rounds of ammunition at Duck Lake is inexcusable.
When my wife heard the half-breeds were coming through Duck Lake on their way to attack Prince Albert, she grabbed the kid and we left.
Thank you. That's all. l didn't think about saving anything but our scalps.
-We're going after that ammunition.
-Very good, sir.
But Col. lrvine's relief force is due shortly.
Relief or not, we cannot allow that ammo to fall into Riel's hand.
-l don't like the smell of this.
-What do you mean? l'm curious to learn where Corbeau plans to find the bullet ridden red coats he promised Big Bear.
That won't be his first lie.
Sergeant.
You will post sentries commanding Beardy's Basin.
That's the only place we could be ambushed this side of Duck Lake.
There's an old cabin there?
That's the cabin.
See that Basin below you? lf Riel's brigade cuts back from the Prince Albert road they'll come through the river bed there.
Each man two hours on watch, two hours rest.
Two hours on your feet, and two hours on your back.
At the first sign of the enemy fall back at gallop and report.
-All this time the half breed army...
-Moving in the other direction.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
You'll be relieved tomorrow.
Bye. Keep your eyes open.
Same to you.
Ekawe!
You fix leg.
Come sit in this nice green chair.
Does the cast hurt you?
No, you help her good that's why l help you.
-Help me? How?.
-You fix. Don't look at me.
Redcoat march for Duck Lake.
Half-breed, they wait in wood, kill Redcoat.
But l thought Riel had marched on Prince Albert.
That's just for trick.
They make trap for Redcoat at Duck Lake.
An ambush?
With the medicine gun?
Yes.
Your brother keep watch on cabin at Beardy's basin.
They gonna kill him tonight.
So he don't see them make what you call ambush.
Ronnie!
Ronnie?
You just trying to scare me. l don't like you pretty much.
But it's Ronnie who's in danger.
-You think l like him too much?
-lf you like him, you can help him.
What do you mean, like? l love Ronnie.
That's why you no like me.
You think l'm no good for him. lf you love him, you'll do as l ask.
He's on outpost duty at the old cabin near Beardy's Basin.
Go to him. Tell him to warn the Police not to march on Duck Lake.
-Why don't you go?
-They won't let me leave Batoche.
Nobody would stop you.
What you think?
Me save police?
Pretty soon my father have all the whiskey business and l wear silk and rings. l think Ronnie like that. lf you don't warn the Police,
Ronnie will hate you.
Maybe that man you love, that big sergeant gonna be killed.
Maybe bullet go through that Scotch lndian.
-Louvette.
-Somofagum, you think you better than me, you go save them. l'm not better than you. lf you want rings, l'll give them to you.
But don't lose anymore time. l beg you on my knees if that will make you go.
Soon medicine gun knock police on their knees.
Maybe tomorrow night the wolf come for what is left.
You say you love Ronnie while you brazenly sit there eating, knowing he's gonna be killed.
There's nothing in you but hate.
You're a savage Louvette.
A vicious, cruel savage.
Blood and revenge is all you know,
-not love.
-Hey you! l'll show you love.
What you want l tell Ronnie?
You'll go?
Sure l go.
Tell Ronnie the half breeds will ambush at Beardy's Basin.
Sure l tell him.
You go home now.
We'll never forget what you've done for us.
No. You won't forget.
-What's after you?
-A big bad rabbit.
Chased me all the way back.
-Male or female?
-l didn't ask.
My tobacco is in the saddle bag.
-Steal it sparingly.
-Thank you. l will.
You need wife for clean the house.
What in the...
What are you doing here?
-How'd you know l was here?
-My father is mad on me.
-Why?
-He find out l got big love for you.
Why didn't you tell me
Corbeau was your father?
Tonight he take plenty half breed made big ride to Prince Albert.
-But when he come back...
-Answer me...
What do you care who is my father?
You hate Jacques Corbeau more strong than you love Louvette. l'd be bat brained about you if your father was the devil himself.
You don't never marry with me now.
Once this is over l'll marry you quicker than you can say Somagum.
That's too late.
Why?
My father gonna kill me
'cause l love Redcoat.
We be married tonight or we don't be married never.
Tonight? lndians shoot priest at Frog Lake today.
Now at Batoche, Duroc he's scared for Father Piccard.
Gonna send him to Regina when daylight come.
Please, he marry us before he go.
-But l can't leave here.
-Nothing happen here.
Why you here for anyway?
Orders.
But you be back before somebody know.
Somofagum. l love you so terrible much.
But l'm on duty.
They'd hang me, shoot me, boil me in oil.
You don't love me because who my father is.
Try to understand. l have to watch the river bed.
That other fellow could watch.
Get in river bed with him. lf your neck wasn't so lovely l'd break it.
You break the heart.
-Always l know you lie to me.
-No!
But that lie is sweet and my heart, she sing like a bird. l don't live without you, Ronnie.
You crazy little loon.
What do you think you'll do?
-l'm going.
-No, you won't.
You're the sweetest poison that ever got in a man's blood. l love you. l want you.
We'll be in Batoche in one hour.
Maybe less.
Ten minutes with the priest.
An hour to get back here.
Ronnie! l'll leave word for Jerry he'll have to take15 minutes of my guard.
He'll yell, but he's a good egg.
Ronnie!
Ronnie, they're coming.
Wake up, Ronnie.
Get back to the fort!
The half-breeds ride.
Warn the force! Ambush...
-What happened to this town?
-They all go Prince Albert to fight for Louis Riel.
We wait in here for Father Piccard. lt's dark as a weasel's bedroom.
Louvette!
The rifle!
Quick, Louvette!
The gun!
You don't need gun now, Ronnie.
Tie him here.
You crawling black scum!
-Shut up.
-Don't you hit him.
-Get out. Get out.
-Pay now.
Get out.
Get out.
Well, come on.
-Cut me loose.
-l got to keep you here. lf l don't you be killed like the others.
You sneaking shewolf.
Killed? Like what others? ln Duck Lake woods 1,000 half breed make trap for Redcoat.
The whole force will be cut to pieces.
-Every man of them.
-Yeah.
But you're alive is all l care.
You, dirty squaw.
Why didn't you tell me? l'll kill you when l get loose.
When you be safe you kill me all you want.
Back to the column. Warn them the outpost's been killed.
Danger of enemy on all sides.
Gallop.
You'd better get back with the column.
Thanks.
That blue eyed klootch has got him.
-That's destroying evidence.
-Which might put that boy in front of a firing squad. lf the whole column rides into a death trap he'll deserve whatever he gets. l was thinking of his sister.
Do you think it'll help to make her pay for his mistakes?
Somebody's paying for it right now.
Sound commence firing.
Take what cover you can find!
-Turn the wagons over for barricades!
-Yes, sir!
Bring those wagons forward!
Steady men!
-Load!
-That gun!
She speak death like the rattling snake.
Yes. She'll get me them red coats for Big Bear.
Now that side!
Sergeant Bret and that Texan are coming through.
-Give them fire cover!
-Yes, sir.
Clear there...
-Help the Sergeant.
-He's alright.
You got nine lives, Sergeant.
Have a spill bud?
No, thanks, just had one.
Keep your heads covered men.
Still got one good arm Bill, use it.
Take your time!
Don't waste a shot!
-Look at that hat. 20 bucks.
-Wear a feather.
Get us out of this crossfire.
Fall back on Carlton.
Yes, sir.
Palmer, Rankin, root out that snipers nest to the rear.
-Right that wagon for the wounded.
-Right.
First section, open the Carlton road.
Sections on the right, fall back 50 yards.
Left sections hold fast.
Bugler, sound retire and continue firing.
Pick up all rifles.
Don't leave any ammunition.
Give me 10 men and l'll hold the road while you drop back.
You drop back with the men. l'll hold the road. l can't hear you.
Louvette.
Let me go to them. l'll do anything. l'll give you anything.
No, Ronnie. l don't let you be killed.
Doctor!
-We're back at Fort Carlton.
-How many got back?
-We don't know yet, sir.
-Many?
No, sir.
They were in the woods thicker than boiled beans on Tuesday.
But we couldn't see them.
Jerry was on outpost.
Why didn't he warn us?
Jerry's dead.
They must have got
Logan when they got Jerry.
Nobody got Logan.
He went over the hill.
-l heard the Sergeant.
-Look out!
Ronnie didn't seem to be that kind of a chap. lf Ronnie had the slugs in his legs l've got in mine he couldn't have run so fast.
Shut up, you fools!
That's his sister.
You always show up where you can help.
They let me leave Batoche is morning.
-What are they saying about Ronnie?
-They're all out of their heads.
Do any of you know where Ronnie is?
-They don't know, April.
-Keep that stretcher working, Sheriff.
-Doctor, the inspector's real bad.
-Alright.
Get this man ready. l'll be back.
-Some brandy here.
-Sergeant, bring that brandy.
-He's lost a lot of blood, no?
-Yes.
-Jim...
-l'm glad you're safe
-but l wish you were anywhere else.
-l tried to get here in time. l could have saved all this... l'd give that tourniquet another twist.
Where's Ronnie?
-ls he... is he...?
-No. l'm sorry. l have to go to the lnspector now.
But...
Don't fight. You'll be alright. l told you to take care of the men.
-Yes, but...
-Nevermind me. Get to the others.
Yes, sir. ls there an assault?
-Not yet, sir.
-Man the bastions. l have, sir.
Did you get proof that Logan deserted?
Yes, sir.
When this is over, make it your job to get him.
Bring him to justice.
Justice... l'm about to get mind.
-Take command, Sergeant.
-Very good, sir.
Some fool at Headquarters, wants to change the uniform to green.
Stand up for the Redcoats. lt's a good color.
-Any sign of a rush?
-Just steady sniping.
-Tod...
-Keep your head down lad
-if you don't want to lose it.
-Can you reach the river?
There's a very good chance.
Get the bateau and canoe and moor them 100 yards below.
We'll try to get through tonight.
That l will.
-Take his place.
-Right.
Look! Look What l see!
-Don't shoot.
-He is police scout.
He the Scotch man.
He's mine!
Nobody shoot.
Where is the knob from the bonnet?
Darn!
Blood of the devil!
Bonjour, you snake in the bush?
Duroc, you old porcupine.
-Foosh to you.
-You son of a pumpkin?
That's a pawky trick.
You snooling clootie!
Who is snooling clootie?
You bairn of a buzzard.
My yarn, my bonnie yarn! l'll never dare to show...
Aye.
You... You skunk you.
Such a thing!
Darn these pants!
Hold 'em up with your teeth.
You, dirty Scotsman!
Bonnie thing you look going naked through the fen.
For goodness sakes!
Yon goes the seat of the government?
Blood of a skunk. l'll show you.
Pig!
Sharpshooter down there seems to have McDuff cornered.
-Got a sight on him?
-No. He's behind...
Now l can.
Dan! Dan!
Dan... l didn't shoot you.
You win the 50 cents.
No Dan. lt was from the fort.
You showed yourself.
You're an old fool my friend.
One more game of pinnacle l skin from you the belt.
Aye, that you would Dan.
-That you would.
-No, Tod. l lose.
No, Dan, it is my loss, every man's loss this day.
The Big Trapper got me by the neck.
The 50 cents she's in my pocket.
Soup?
-Any more soup and they'll bust?
-l must get this...
-Stop carrying it long enough...
-But...
You've been ramming around here for 10 hours, using up all the Queen's bandages and l never saw you beat.
Well, you haven't been playing croquet.
Special orders is you stop now.
And have a cup of coffee.
Dusty, what happened?
Happened?
Did something happen? l didn't notice anything happening. l don't like women who cry.
You know something, lady? l make the best coffee in Texas.
You can float a horseshoe in my coffee.
Over and over l hear them say his name but they won't tell me anything.
Look... just kind of
-get down some of this Java
-Even Jim won't tell me anything.
Two sugars?
Jim is a great soldier.
But if you don't drink this here coffee...
Where is Ronnie?
What's happened to him?
Now listen... l don't know Ronnie so very well but l know you.
The first time l saw you l knew you better than anyone l've known. l know it couldn't be in your brother's blood to be cowardly.
But, love does funny things to people.
You've been a good soldier. l've got a tough job for you, if you'll take it.
You want me to put some salt on Corbeau's tail? l'm trying to get the wounded to the river under smoke cover.
-What smoke?
-We'll burn the fort.
-Coffee?
-Thanks. lt'll be your job to get April and the wounded down the river to meet Colonel lrvine's reinforcements.
-You'll stay and roast chestnuts?
-l have 7 men sound enough to ride. l'll be there when Corbeau throws those red coats in front of Big Bear.
Looks to me like you're just delivering seven more red coats.
Maybe.
Jim.
You've got to tell me. l know it.
But let me tell you first that l love you.
Always l guess. You'll never be able to look at me again.
Nothing under heaven can ever bring us together...
What do you mean?
You've got to know it, so l'd rather you knew it from me.
Ronnie is not dead.
He deserted.
He left his post, left his companion sentry.
He was killed.
He could have warned the column.
All those men lying dead might still be living if Ronnie...
-but he ran away.
-No, no!
He ran away with that half breed
Corbeau's daughter!
But l sent her to him, to warn him, to warn you.
Didn't you know he'd sell his soul for that girl? l don't believe Ronnie deserted. lf you prove it to me 100 times, l still won't believe it.
Jim lad, the half-breeds being a wee bit confused with the death of poor Dan Duroc. lt's the time to be going.
Tell Corporal Underhill to have the patrol in full dress order sidearms and rifles then set fire to the buildings.
Aye, all is ready then now. l hope you never believe
Ronnie is guilty but that doesn't change my job.
When this over l'm going to get him and bring him back. l will get him if l have to follow him over the icecap.
You know what that means for him. l know you're duty comes before everything else. l know it means more than mercy or love.
Go on, follow your orders.
Kill that boy who was foolish enough to put love first!
But don't tell me how sorry you are!
Just do your duty and kill!
We'll take you and the wounded as far as the river.
Dusty will take care of you there.
We're going on to Big Bear's camp.
Pray that l don't come back.
You'll have to let me look after you now.
-Better throw some wash in my face.
-What? l have no right to be crying over my troubles.
The wounded must be moved. They'll need all the help we can give.
Looks like you need some help yourself lady.
Attent hut!
This is a volunteer patrol.
Once we've entered Big Bear's camp no man of you can properly expect to come out alive. lf any of you prefer to go with the wounded you may fall out.
Thank you.
Fyffe, you're hurt.
You'll have to go with the wounded.
No, l'm alright. l can fight.
Join the wounded as directed.
Yes, sir.
We'll take the wounded to the river first.
Keep them under cover.
Corporal, mount the patrol.
Patrol! Prepare to mount.
They die in there you think.
Maybe so. l don't see nobody come out.
Men with leg wounds man the paddles.
Dusty and McDuff, scout the shores with a canoe. lt's a dangerous place you choose lassie. l can't leave these two men.
They're the worst hurt.
Good luck, Soldier.
Thanks.
That'll be Colonel lrvine's relief column. ln camp, beyond the bend.
That's a pretty sounding noise. l was afraid these boys would never see that camp.
You're going to and you'll get some rest. l'm leaving.
-Why?
-Going hunting. lt's no use.
Jim has Corbeau by now.
-Or Corbeau has...
-l wasn't thinking about Corbeau.
Ronnie?
Well, l'd like to have a powow with the wolfgirl he's been with.
Ronnie's dead. l know he is.
He wouldn't run away.
He'd come back and face it.
Sure he would.
Maybe he can't come back.
Maybe he sort of lost his head. l got a feeling l can make things easier for you if you'd let me.
You're grand person, but there's nothing anyone can do for me.
Sure there is.
Come to Texas with me. lf Ronnie's alive, he'll find us there. l'll never see Ronnie again.
He's gone.
Not when somebody cares as much about you as l do. lf you want what's left of me after all this l'll go with you. l'm a coward Dusty! l want to run away.
You're the loveliest and gentlest woman l've ever known but you haven't closed your eyes in 24 hours. l don't want you to say yes without thinking. l don't want to think.
When we get to Texas, you won't have to.
-Texas must be heaven.
-lt will be when you get there.
Pull into shore Tod, then take
April down to lrvine's camp. l'm splitting off here.
What manner of frisky are you up to now?.
Well, there's a couple of things l got to do. l kept my promise Big Bear.
Red coats full of holes like a net.
This one belonged to that Sergeant who said he'd put me in irons.
Medicine gun speak like thunder.
Keep your promise, Big Bear.
War!
Kill. War!
War!
So dead men ride?
You cannot kill the dead.
Tell your war chief to spread his blanket on the ground Big Bear?
Tell your men to fire!
Kill the dogs!
You tell me they are dead.
Let us know what dead men want.
Nestestu! Put the blanket here.
The blanket!
Put the blanket here.
The spirits of the brave are still inside their red coats.
They are sacred. Tell your men to lay them on the blanket.
The brothers of the dead are brave.
Put them on the blanket.
No, no! These enemies are in your hands. Pull them down!
Kill them! Now! lf one shot is fired, the soldiers of the Queen will come like the sands of the great salt sea.
You and your sons will die and your children's children will never walk on the Earth.
The other coats Big Bear.
We are waiting.
Put the coats on the blanket.
Pull 'em off the horses!
Kill them!
Are you afraid of 7 men?
Kill them, you fools!
There's no magic in their red coats.
Throw them to the crows.
Like this.
You're under arrest!
Shoot, you fools! Shoot!
Shut up!
Two men on the left, dismount.
Take the prisoner.
-On your feet, now.
-What's the matter? Tired?
You're too heavy to carry.
Will Big Bear kneel to the Queen and be the chief of his people again?
The Cree are brothers to the brave.
This fellow keep Redcoats out of Batoche.
Look!
The canoes go down river by himself! lt's my bateau, come on!
Look! Come on!
-Let's go!
-Don't let him go.
You know Louvette?
No Gatling gun, no Riel, no lndians, no fight.
You come home, l give you all the fight you want.
Yes, mama.
-You know Louvette Corbeau?
-l know no one like that.
Well, l guess that's right.
-You want something?
-You know Louvette?
-Yes.
-Of course.
-Louvette Corbeau?
-Sure. Come on.
Are you hungry?
No.
You don't feel good, huh? l feel alright.
A man's brain can be sick.
He goes on breathing and living until he rots.
My heart wants you so much.
She all the time say your name.
Ronnie, Ronnie... l should have torn your tongue out the first time l heard you say that.
No, we go away Ronnie.
Way up to far North.
To land of little sticks.
Nobody don't find us there.
One man l can't get away from even there.
A filthy rat that can't stand the sight of his own face.
Me.
My love, l make you forget.
Forget? l ought to...!
You want to kill me? l'm too much of a coward even to do that.
Because l love you.
Two wild geese go north.
Hello, Ronnie.
Why you come here? l was just passing by. lt looks like this war is kind of bogged down.
You come here for hurt him?
Nothing l say could hurt him any. lt's already been said.
-What's been said?
-Don't listen to him, Ronnie. l want to know!
Well, that you ran from your post and you're hiding out like a skunk and haven't got what it takes to go back and swallow your medicine.
-Does April say that?
-No.
She figures you're dead.
She knows if you could even crawl you'd get back there to face 'em.
Don't listen to him! lf you go back they kill you.
She may be right.
The militia's brought in martial law.
You know the Mounted Police are a great body of men.
For years they've been through hell without a yellow mark against them. l'd hate to see April's brother be the first to chalk one up.
Make him go away.
He just talk crazy lie for you.
-l'm heading for Batoche, coming?
-No, Ronnie, no!
You coming?
What for? l'm already buried in the grave of every man killed at Duck Lake.
-They're bound to find you.
-With your help?
No, they don't never find. l fix so you don't tell nothing. l won't turn you in, but April's got a right to know.
Why don't you let me stay dead?
Because you're not a coward.
Whiteman, ride horse with white face.
Go quick, Crow.
Go get him.
Viva Canadian womens, fly my heart, fly high!
Viva Canadian womens, who has so sweet the eyes!
Who has so sweet the eye!
Who has so sweet the eye!
Ronnie?
He's gone to Batoche. l loaned him my horse.
Ronnie!
Ronnie!
Ronnie!
Ronnie...
Kill...
Kill...
Kill...
How much l morn for you...
Love does funny things to people.
Captain Gower of the Canadian Militia is here to help us get what facts we can concerning the ambush at Duck Lake before the General convenes his court martial.
Yes, sir. l'm the one to blame.
Not my brother. l sent her to him, sent her to warn him.
Miss Logan, none of us are on trial.
We're only trying to find out what happened. l should have known Louvette would lie to him.
-That she...
-That she was in love with him and would persuade him to run away with her.
That's not true!
Ronnie wasn't afraid of anything. lf he's alive, he'll come back. l'm very sorry but the evidence we've gathered is conclusive.
Sergeant, you are personal assignment is to keep after Logan until you've place him under arrest.
Yes, sir.
-That is all!
-Capitan Gower...
-What is it?
-l don't know. Someone got killed.
Fall back!
Fall back there!
Constable Logan reporting.
Ronnie!
-Who is this man?
-An American Peace Officer,
Texas Rangers. ls this Constable Logan's body?
-Yes, sir.
-l don't understand.
This boy was captured. Look at his wrists where the thongs cut in.
They thought you ran away...
The man has been bound certainly. l don't know how he got loose but when l saw him he was free.
Maybe he could have got back to report but he didn't.
Because there was something he wanted more than he wanted his own life.
-What do you mean?
-l mean the Gatling gun.
What did Logan have to do with the Gatling gun?
The half-breeds had it on the bluff, commanding the south approach.
We saw what happens to troops who rush a gun like that.
But the kid could rush it because he was on the inside of their lines.
Now you all decided he quit his post.
Where l come from we don't jump to conclusions. lt's liable to be a fellow's last jump. l can tell you every move the boy made.
And l can tell you this, if you'd had 3 more men like him you'd have put down your rebellion in 24 hours.
He got their boats in the river to pull the crew away from the gun, then he got a horse and dragged the gun off riding like a bat out of hell.
The half-breeds spotted him but he got the bluff above the river.
Bullets were as thick as flies but they didn't stop him over he goes, horse, man, and gun rolling like a Texas twister over the sheer drop.
That's where l find him.
That's where you'll find the gun at the bottom of the river.
He never gave up.
He never quit.
He never ran away from anything because it wasn't in him to run.
He just kept going on like l think you'd want him to.
Constable Logan shall receive the highest military honors. l'll mention Logan's bravery to General Middleton.
Where were you all this time? l was squeezed under a log so tight l was breathing on the installment plan.
Shall l include that in my letter to your Texas Commandant? l hope you won't. l'll be in trouble enough without Corbeau.
Dusty!
You're an angel in leather. l'd look funny with leather wings. l'm sorry l misjudged a brave man.
Yes, we... all are.
Sergeant!
You will deliver prisoners
Riel and Corbeau to Regina.
-Last stop before Regina.
-Long way to ride
-before a hanging.
-They don't think so.
You be tying a wet knot.
Eight days with them traveling 200 miles.
Cold molasses could move faster.
Thank you.
-Where's Jim?
-Went riding with April. lf l should disappear, you know, vanish will you tell April l'll be back for her? lf you're as blind on the trail as you are with your lassie you'll never find your way back. l could never manage one of these contraptions. lt's a shame to waste it.
Either the hand of fate or someone thinks you ought to shave?
Well?
No, one maybe can get through, but there's no chance for two.
Find your own finish. l'm ready for mine whatever it may be. l'll have my knife back now. l give it to you!
No, sunny side up.
Now we're heading back for Texas. l hid your horse under that silver mine you call a saddle.
Just a minute, cowboy!
Going somewhere?
Don't look like l'm going very far.
Come on out, April. lt's nobody but Dusty taking a little ride.
Just trying to get away from it all.
Can we ride a little way with you, Dusty?
Why yes, ma'am.
Do Canadians ever go snow blind in the summer?
We're all a little blind sometimes. l'm not.
There's talk some fellow may try to get Corbeau away from us.
-How's that again?
-lt's only 100 miles from the Montana border.
And no telegraph. ls that so? l'll check when l get back. lf anyone's missing l'll have every man in the troop after them. l can't say l blame you.
Jim, Dusty seems a little restless.
Maybe he's thinking about a man who moved in on a friend that trusted him.
Sneaked in behind his back like a weasel in a hen coop and stole the one thing his friend valued most.
No, l wasn't thinking about that.
Wouldn't you say he'd loathe his friend for doing such a low contemptible thing to him?
He'd certainly owe him an apology.
Well? l apologize.
You apologize?
Jim's trying to tell you that he's taking something he thought belonged to you.
You? lf l'm free.
She told me once, l'd be alright if something beat me to my knees. l've been brought down hard.
No, l'm the one who surrendered.
But l wouldn't change him. l guess l've just been having a beautiful pipe dream in the middle of a nightmare.
Sure.
Sure, you're free.
You got what we both want, l got what l came for. l'll say the Mounted Police are the greatest outfit l ever tangled with and the luckiest.
Texas Rangers are two fisted fighters themselves.
And one of them is the most magnificent liar in the world.
Goodbye, Dusty.
Texas is gonna miss you.
There'll always be a part of Texas in our hearts.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, sweetheart.
SubRip:diamarg
Hmm, two today.
What's up, Red?
Having company this morning?
Company? Hey, hold it, will you, Creamy?
I got something to show you.
Okay.
It's a big day, Creamy.
Having breakfast with my girl in the park.
She doesn't know about it.
I got a surprise for her.
Get a load of this.
What did I do with it?
I paid 18 bucks for that thing.
I hope I haven't been robbed.
There.
You was robbed.
Look, ain't it supposed to have a diamond in it?
Supposed to have?
It's got a diamond in it,
I think.
Yeah, there. See?
You got to get it in the right kind of light.
Where?
Well, move in where you can see it.
I hope her eyes are better than mine.
They are. Prettier, too!
If she accepts that, she ain't marrying you for your money.
Oh, Red, this is wonderful.
But I have to go to work early today.
Oh?
You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.
Oh, it's no trouble.
I wanted to show you what a handy guy
I could be in the kitchen.
I like your kitchen.
Lots of nice sunshine coming in the windows.
Yeah, it's good when it rains, too.
You can have your coffee and morning shower at the same time.
Can I warm up your coffee for you?
I don't think
I'll have time, Red.
Mr. Wallick's driving me to work.
That guy!
Now he's making passes at you on my time.
Gee, the way he drools when he looks at you.
Even his eyelids pant.
Oh, Red, he isn't that bad.
And besides, he's a very successful Fuller Brush Man.
Successful?
He couldn't sell pimples to a goose!
Hey, I'm going to have to put something on your finger to make you remember to forget that guy.
Ann, I want to tell you about a friend of mine.
He's a jeweler.
Well, he hasn't been doing very well lately, so, well, I thought I'd kind of help him out a little.
Oh, Ann, I didn't mean to make you cry.
It's just a little diamond, but...
You shouldn't have done it, Red.
Shouldn't have done it?
Why not?
I shall have it paid for in eight years.
By that time our oldest child will be selling papers and what he earns with what I earn, why, we'll have it paid for in no time.
Oh, don't joke, Red.
I'm not joking, Ann.
You know how I feel about you.
Gosh, I fell in love with you the first time I ever saw you.
Remember? It was in church on Easter Sunday.
You sang the solo.
Gosh, you were wonderful.
Then I joined the choir.
I didn't mind being with those sopranos as long as I could be near you.
Oh, please, Red.
I understand how you feel.
That's what makes it so difficult.
I can't accept it, Red.
You see, you just aren't ready to accept the responsibility of having a wife and a family.
Oh, I know you try, Red, but you go from job to job.
You just don't take your future seriously enough.
Well, I've had this job for three weeks.
Yes, but how long will it last, Red?
Look at all the other jobs.
The time you drove a bus.
That only lasted three days.
Well, that wasn't exactly my fault. I...
I was trying to get the passengers to the rear of the bus and just forgot to watch where the front was going.
Hey you, Don Juan.
Is this your cart?
Yes, sir.
What do you want to do, burn up the park?
Oh, that's all right, Officer.
I know all about fire prevention.
I worked for the Fire
Department for three weeks.
Well, if you don't keep your eye on that thing, you'll learn something about crime prevention.
Oh?
And that's another thing.
Three weeks with the Fire Department.
Well, so what if
I was late to a fire.
I saved the house.
Yes, but by that time, the house had already burned to the ground.
Yeah, but I saved it.
I've got the ashes home in a little box.
Oh, stop clowning.
Don't you see what I mean, Red?
Something always happens with your jobs.
You never keep them.
You've got to settle down.
You've got to get somewhere and be someone before you can think of marriage.
You mean be someone like Wallick?
Well, yes, Red.
He's successful.
He's getting somewhere.
Let's go, Ann. We're late!
I'm sorry, Red.
I've got to leave now.
But, Ann, listen, I...
Listen, Ann...
Listen...
Beep-beep yourself!
I'll see you later, Red.
We'll talk about everything.
Hiya, Red.
I see you're still wearing the white ducks.
Well, quack-quack!
Put all your paper plates in there.
Well, I've got 24 months to pay and then I'll have it refinanced.
We believe in aiding our public servants in keeping the city clean.
Oh, that's very nice of you, very nice.
Oh, no! Here, don't.
No, don't put that in there. Here!
Girls, help! Help!
Beaver Patrol to the rescue!
Beaver Patrol to the rescue!
Beaver Patrol to the rescue!
Beaver Patrol to the rescue!
Come on!
Girls, form a bucket brigade. Charge!
The bucket brigade!
The bucket brigade!
Come on.
The bucket brigade!
Keep it going, Beavers.
Keep a nice straight line.
No excitement!
Be sure you have your glass full.
Form the bucket brigade, girls.
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
The fire's over there!
Hey, you!
You all right,
Commissioner Trist?
Look at my car!
Look what that idiot did to my car.
Get him off of here.
You numbskull!
I personally am going to see that a menace like you is removed from the public highways.
Commissioner Trist!
Exactly.
Commissioner, I've always wanted to meet you.
After all, working in the same department, it's a shame we're strangers.
My name's Jones.
Got that?
Yes, sir. Jones.
Capital J-O-N-E-S.
Of course, this isn't a formal way of meeting, but...
Take a memo.
I want this man fired.
I want him thrown out of the department.
Out. Far out!
Now, let's not get hasty, Commissioner.
After all, good men like me are hard to replace.
Why, it may take you, oh, hours.
Now, I know you want your streets kept neat and tidy...
Yes! That's why
I'm firing you.
Here you are, Carefree.
You know, I don't blame my girl for turning me down.
Everything happens to me, even when I try be careful.
Goodbye.
Gentlemen, Mr. Seward is ready to see you now.
Well, Red, what are you doing here?
What happened?
Well, Ann, I got to thinking about what you said.
About making something of myself.
Well, I decided to talk to the Commissioner and...
I smashed up his car and broke his windshield.
And got fired?
Yeah.
I'd have been up for a pension in 20 years.
But it wasn't my fault.
It never is.
But somehow, some way, you always get into trouble.
Always going somewhere and never getting there.
Every time you get a clear stretch, you take your eyes off the road.
Why, a girl would be a fool to go along with you.
Yeah, I wish you felt foolish, Ann.
But it's no use. I...
I just came up to say goodbye.
Goodbye, Ann.
Oh, Ann, there's something
I borrowed from you that I'd kind of like to keep.
What?
That hot water bottle.
Looks like it's going to be an awful cold winter.
Red!
Yeah? Did you call me, Ann?
Well, I... I've been thinking about you, Red.
Oh, that's wonderful.
To think you've been thinking about me.
What have you been thinking about?
Well, that maybe you deserve one more chance.
Just one more!
Oh, I'll take it.
Perhaps you've had the wrong kind of jobs.
Maybe if you went into business for yourself, as your own boss, became a Fuller Brush Man.
Me? A Fuller Brush Man?
Hiya, puddle-pusher.
Hello, Ann.
Well, in case Red forgot to mention it, it's all on page five, right there.
I guess you really told the Commissioner off, huh, Red?
Oh, I gave him a piece of my mind.
Well, that should set him back a couple of years.
We've just been through all that, Mr. Wallick.
Yeah, it was a very lucky accident.
I'm going to become a Fuller Brush Man.
Well, you're insulting a very fine product.
But, Mr. Wallick, you could help Red.
You could recommend him to our district manager.
Oh, now, wait a second.
If this lunkhead could become a successful
Fuller Brush salesman,
I'd better get a job mowing lawns.
Look, Mr. Wallick, I'll try very hard and if I'm successful, I'll...
Well, I'll help you mow the lawn.
Ann, believe me, every time
I knock on the door, I'll ring the bell.
You're lucky if every time you knock on the door, the door doesn't knock back.
Oh, please, Mr. Wallick, I know
Red will make you proud of him.
Especially when the top Fuller Brush dealer shows him what to do.
Ann!
Yes, Mr. Seward?
Please?
Well, okay, but it's like watering a weed with champagne.
Now, this is the sample kit.
Oh?
What are you selling?
Knockout drops?
Oh, look at the brushes, snug as little bugs in a rug.
We do not like to think of our brushes as bugs.
I like to think of my fingers, though.
Now, point number one.
In order to sell brushes, you must get into the customer's house, true?
True.
You do that by making a favorable impression and having a pleasing personality.
And believe me, brother, you're in trouble from the start.
End of point one.
Ooh!
Oh, on point two, do I get my hand back?
I won't be around to see.
Hey, wait a minute.
Explain that toothbrush to me, will you?
That is no toothbrush.
Aw, it's a wonderful toothbrush.
Cleans your ears and teeth at the same time.
That brush is for cleaning Venetian blinds.
My Aunt Maude had one like that.
It used to keep her choppers nice and choppy.
Hey, that's not very good.
Leaves hair in your teeth.
You'd better go back to manicuring the street.
Oh, you don't think
I could sell brushes, huh?
I know you couldn't.
Let me borrow your kit.
What are you going to do?
I'll show you real salesmanship.
Now, this is the door to the customer's house.
I'm the brush man.
It was me.
She's coming to the door.
Coming to the door.
"Who is it?"
"Your Fuller Brush
Man, madam."
"Oh, just a moment.
"Oh, good heavens, he would come today and I'm a mess."
"Don't go away!"
What are you doing?
Well, a girl has to think of her appearance.
And stop peeking in my window!
"Hello." Now,
I'm in the house.
Yeah.
You be the lady, now.
Good morning, madam.
We'd like to show you some of our very fine brushes.
I'm not interested.
Oh, you're interested in a brush, aren't you?
Nope.
How about a nice mop?
Mmm-mmm.
A wonderful floor mop?
Don't want any.
Ceiling, walls and windows.
It doubles as a toupee, with a built-in shampoo.
Can't use it.
Could I interest you in a nice hairbrush?
No.
Specially constructed for people with short arms.
Sorry.
Madam, you need a hairbrush.
Why?
When people look at you, do they say,
"That reminds me.
I've got to wash my dog"?
What?
Don't you ever change your oil?
Why, if I thought for one second that you would do...
Mr. Seward, this is Mr. Jones.
I'm glad to know you,
Mr. Seward.
Well, if you're as good a salesman as Miss Elliot says,
I'd like to talk to you as soon as a new territory opens up.
Oh?
And if you do half as well as Wallick here, you'll have nothing to worry about.
Well, thank you.
Oh, Mr. Seward!
Oh, I don't know what you said to the old man, but how do you expect
Red to live up to it?
And what's more important, how can we live it down?
But, Mr. Wallick, I...
I only told him Red was a terrific salesman.
And he believed it?
Yes.
Oh, well, I don't.
Well, I do.
That's two to one.
Now, look, this is a very simple matter to settle.
We can all go out right now on our lunch hour and pick out a few houses for Red to try and see what happens.
Yeah.
Yeah, I could pick out a few houses, couldn't I?
Here, let me pick 'em out.
Oh, no, no, Red.
I know the good ones.
Oh?
Now, there's just one more thing,
Red, before we go.
This is your last chance.
If you can't make good with Mr. Wallick's help, then I give up.
I'll make good.
Now, here's a street
I intended to visit today.
Red can make my calls.
Jasmine Street, a real sweet street.
Okay, take your pick.
Now, remember all the things we told you, Red.
I know you're going to do just fine.
Want to bet, say about a million dollars?
I'll bet more than that.
All right. A kiss?
It's a deal.
Oh, wait a minute.
Remember, sell your personality.
You won't get much for it, but keep trying.
Mmm-hmm.
I'll start over there.
How about a movie tonight, Ann?
Might put you in the mood to pay off the bet.
Okay.
But we're not at the movie yet.
Would you be interested in a hairbrush?
Would you be interested in a hairbrush?
Would you be interested in a hairbrush?
Would you...
Good day.
Good day.
He couldn't even get in the house.
You lose.
Well, he'll sell the next one.
Double or nothing?
It's a bet.
First thing is to get the foot inside the door.
Well, who does you have a subpoenee for?
I don't have a subpoenee.
What is you collecting for?
Not a thing.
Then you has the wrong house, bub!
Here.
Here.
Ooh!
Little boy, let me have my case.
Give it to me.
Give it...
Not that way, though.
Oh!
Would you like to buy a brush?
A very nice hairbrush, soft bristles on both sides?
No, I don't want to...
Yeah, I'll buy your brushes.
You know, I like you.
I like you, too.
Hmm.
Look, let me come in and pick up my brushes, will you?
I know you're a nice boy.
Boy, have you got a surprise coming, kiddo.
Ooh! Ooh!
Here, my foot. My foot.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Quit it.
Stop! I'm going to skin you alive.
If you come any closer,
I'll drop it.
Oh, no.
That's my good shoe.
Look, I'll sit right over here.
I won't come any closer.
Boy, if there's anything I hate, it's a quitter.
Oh, no!
Now what did you do that for?
Grandma! Grandma!
He's murdering the little fishies.
Oh, brother!
I wish you were my size so I could cut you down to your size.
Junior, what's going on in...
Who are you?
He was murdering the little fishies, Grandma.
He was pushing their little heads under the water.
I was not, Grandma.
I mean, madam.
I'm your Fuller Brush Man.
I'm sure you could use a hairbrush that's flat on one side.
Well, as a matter of fact, it happens I do need one.
You certainly do.
Let me show you some of our newest brushes. Here.
Oh, yes, let me.
Oh, my, that's a good one.
Has a lovely sting to it.
Junior, that calls for a spanking.
You better not spank me,
Grandma, or I will tell.
You'll tell what?
That you was a shimmy dancer in the side show.
Ooh! I was no such thing.
Oh, no?
Junior!
See?
Grandma, compliments of the company.
I'm sorry we don't have one with a nail in it.
Good day.
Grandma, Grandma.
He broke my little skate.
Grandma, Grandma.
He broke my little skate.
I should have started with this house in the first place.
I'll break your winning streak if it's the last thing I do.
Let's make this a big bet, Ann.
Three kisses this time.
It's a bet.
Hey, don't you know that betting is illegal?
You can't insult me, pal.
I'll just turn the other cheek.
I do hope he finds this house easier.
Oh, he shouldn't have any trouble at all with Miss Sharmley.
Main point, pleasing personality.
Get into the house.
Hello? Grant?
I'm glad you called.
What does that pea-brain in casting mean,
I'm not alluring enough for the part?
Maybe my name isn't Tondeleyo, but I've brushed off more men than the porter at the Waldorf.
Just a minute!
Now, listen...
Just a minute!
You tell him I want that part.
Not alluring enough!
Well, just give me a man.
Any man.
I'll get in.
I'm your Muller Frush Pan.
I mean, your Fuller Mush Man.
Want to buy a brush?
Well, at least he got into that house.
Yeah, I can't understand...
I mean, I can't understand why it was so difficult.
Oh.
I was passing by and
I thought I'd drop in.
I'm glad you did.
You have such nice hair.
So wavy.
If you keep that up, you're going to straighten it out.
What I came by to see you about is, well, I'm your new Fuller Brush Man,
Miss, uh... Miss, uh...
You can call me Baby.
Well, I'd like to show you some of our finest baby brushes.
I mean, I'd like to show you some of our brushes, Baby.
Now, here's a very fine brush.
Now, to sell the brush, the first point is to get into the house.
The second...
Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
Here a... Oh, I'm sorry.
That... It's just the hose.
This is our friction shower and bath brush.
It's a very handy little thing.
You connect this onto the nozzle like that, see?
And, uh, then you turn on the faucet.
Then the water comes down.
Then the...
How interesting!
I might take one of those.
Really? Well, that'll be $4.75 and...
If you will demonstrate it for me.
Demonstrate it? Well, this is a bath brush.
Maybe I should come back Saturday night?
When I ask men to do something, they usually eat out of my hand.
Well, I've had my lunch.
Men find me very alluring.
They can't get me out of their blood.
This is no time for a transfusion.
Kiss me. You're no different than the others.
All men follow me like sheep.
Well, not me.
There must be some way to get back into Fuller Brushes again.
I can't understand what's taking him so long.
Why don't we take a peek and see what's cooking?
Yes, let's do.
I'm curious.
Have you made up your mind about this brush yet, Miss Sharmley?
Not yet.
Keep demonstrating it,
Mr. Jones.
I guess this is the only way to do it and still keep the crease in my trousers.
You know I've gotten much further with you than I have with any of my customers,
Miss Sharmley.
How much further do I have to go?
Oh, hi, Ann.
How am I doing?
Great. You'll make a fine Fuller Brush Man.
At least you remembered to wear a smile.
Say, I hope she isn't your wife.
Oh, she isn't.
And she won't be at this rate.
Wait a second, Ann.
I'll drive you back to the office.
Don't bother.
I'll take a bus.
How about it, Ann?
Now do you think he'll make good?
Not with me, he won't.
Ann!
Where's she going?
What, do you have to see it in black printing?
You and Ann are through.
Get it?
Why, I'd like to get it from Ann, if you don't mind.
All right. Now, look, if you're going to be the die-hard type, we'll settle this in a sporting manner.
Now, you're a betting man, aren't you?
Yeah, but I'm not going to kiss you.
All right, I'll tell you what.
Pick out a couple of houses.
If you can make a sale in one, just one, you win.
If you don't, I win.
Okay. Win what?
Ann.
Ann?
That's right.
If you lose, you get out of her hair.
If I lose, I'll do likewise.
Oh, that's awful beautiful hair to get out of.
Well, then, is it a bet?
Yeah, it's a bet.
Want me to help you pick out a couple of winners? I know 'em all.
No, I'll pick out my own house.
Mmm-hmm.
How about that white one over there?
That's a nice house, prosperous and dusty.
Think I'll try that one down there.
Oh, no, Red. Hey, don't even.
Take it from me.
Don't try that one.
Believe me.
That's for me.
If I miss on this one, we're getting off of this street.
It's poison!
Ain't it the truth?
Is this Gordon Trist, the Commissioner of Sanitation?
Speaking.
Well, you bubble-headed dunce, this is Red Jones, the street cleaner who smashed up your car.
Listen, you flannel-eared baboon, what's the idea of having me fired?
My only regret is that I personally wasn't able to kick you out on your ear!
Well, stop flapping that fat lip of yours and listen.
Maybe I'll give you that chance, beetle face.
And maybe I'll bust you as wide open as the state of Nevada.
How'd you do?
Didn't do any good at all.
Didn't, huh?
Nope.
Well, I just checked with the office.
A customer of mine called in from Bel Air.
Wants to give me a big order.
So I guess I'm going to have to go over there right now.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
Didn't you say I had a couple of chances? Yeah.
I've got one more coming?
Well...
Didn't you say I could pick my own houses?
That's right.
My next house is in Bel Air.
Oh, that's not...
Well, I guess a bet is a bet, isn't it?
Yeah.
Okay, but remember, this is your last chance.
Okay. And I want you to know I appreciate this.
I'll be right out.
You ain't kidding.
Oh, may I see the lady of the house?
I'm Mr. Jones, the new Fuller Brush Man.
One moment, sir.
Yeah.
Point number one.
Get into the house.
Get into the house.
Boy, it sure would hold a lot of hay, wouldn't it?
Wonder what time the feature starts?
Well, why would anybody want his picture in their house?
Let's go in the patio, Mildred.
Let me get you a cool drink.
You've had a horrible morning.
It wasn't so horrible, darling, until that street cleaner
Jones came back into my life.
How I'd like to take his neck in my bare hands and squeeze till his eyes pop!
He'd better stay out of my way if he values his life.
Mrs. Trist, I beg your pardon.
A gentleman to see you.
Mr. Jones, a Fuller Brush Man.
Did you get that gopher yet?
I will. I set a trap for him.
We've no time for peddlers.
Very good, Mr. Trist.
Please serve our drinks outside, Billings.
Yes, madam.
Hey, that's the trap.
We got our gopher.
Where is it?
Gosh, it must have been a big one!
He took the trap with him.
Well, we'll get him next time.
Come sit down, darling, and relax.
Why don't you have a cigar?
You seem to be worried.
What is it, Gordon?
I am worried. About my war surplus warehouse.
It's dangerous, Gordon, for a public official to use his office for personal gain.
Unless he can trust his front man.
Oh, Gregory Cruckston?
Yes. He's pulling a fast one behind my back.
If there's one thing I hate, it's being a victim of sloppy bookkeeping.
He just isn't neat with $1,000 bills.
You've been over the books?
Yes, I'm having a showdown with him tonight.
What if Cruckston can't explain?
That will make it tough, on one of us.
Billings must have spiked the lemonade.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
Oh, good afternoon.
I'm your Fuller Brush Man.
I'm sure I have a few items here that will be of interest to you.
Our new plastic brushes.
Haven't I seen you before?
Oh, no.
Nobody's ever seen me before.
Say, did you know that you have fungus on your forget-me-nots?
Now, I'm sure you would like to get the pests out of your garden.
I certainly would!
We have the very brush for that.
Oh, how do you do?
Here's a wonderful brush for removing the brunette hairs from your coat before your wife discovers them.
It's also good for your bubble bath.
Now I recognize you.
So I'm a bubble-headed dunce, eh?
So I'm a flannel-eared baboon?
Oh, I never thought of that.
But I bet it keeps your head warm.
Well, I see you've got other things on your mind.
So, I'll come back when you're not busy.
Too bad, Red.
I guess you lose.
Hey, that wasn't fair.
Commissioner Trist lives there.
And... Oh, what's the difference?
If I'd have picked another house,
Dracula would have probably lived there.
I may as well admit it.
I lose.
Well, tough luck, old man.
I'll say goodbye to Ann for you.
Hey, you.
Here! And stay out!
Just a minute.
Well, you're the only one who hasn't taken a poke at me but if you've got any ideas,
I warn you, I'll hit back.
I'm terribly sorry.
My husband has an ungovernable temper.
Yeah, it must be pretty hard on you having to feed him raw meat three times a day.
Is it that bad?
That bad? I'll say.
If I'd have sold one brush at this house,
I could have won a bet, a girl and maybe a job.
We can fix that.
How?
You mean, you'll buy a brush?
It's the least I can do to make amends for my husband.
How many brushes do you have to sell?
Only one.
I mean, 10, 10.
Oh, I'm sure you can use 10 brushes, couldn't you, Mrs. Trist?
Oh, of course.
I'll take 10 of these.
Oh, boy, 10 brushes.
Not bad for a start.
Boy, Ann's going to be proud of me.
I can't wait to see the expression on Wallick's face when he finds out.
Well, goodbye.
Oh, I'm sorry I made any cracks about your husband.
I'm sure you cook his meat a little.
Your money.
You forgot to get paid.
Ann, I gave him all the breaks, but right after you left, he caused a riot at one house and he got thrown out on his ear in the next.
I'm afraid he's a born failure.
Well, thanks anyway,
Mr. Wallick.
For you, Ann, anything.
You know that.
I did it! Congratulate me.
I did it.
I know you did.
Can't you ever do anything without getting into trouble?
Well, I can take this kind of trouble to any bank and get credit.
I sold 10 plastic brushes to my last customer.
That ain't the way I saw it.
Oh, Red, did you really sell them?
Sure. After he left,
I turned on the charm.
Brushes sold like bubble gum at recess time.
Let me see your order blank.
I didn't use any order blanks.
I sold them right out of the case, see?
Now, here.
You can have your case back.
No order blank.
Now, wait a minute.
Red's new at this.
He could very easily have forgotten to get his order blank signed.
Well, where's the money for the brushes, Red?
Oh, gosh. I forgot to get the money.
Oh, Red, you couldn't!
Ten brushes, you wouldn't have just left them there?
He expects us to believe anything.
And while we're at it, those 10 brushes were mine.
Either put 'em back in the case or put the money in my hand.
Ann, believe me, I did sell 'em.
And to prove it, I'll go back and get the money and the order blanks signed.
Of course, I'll have to change clothes.
A salesman has to put his best foot forward, you know.
Wrong foot again.
Oh-oh! What's that?
Shame on you, frightening people.
Very nice, Sara.
You haven't forgotten any of my old favorites.
Sara seems to have forgotten mine.
Perhaps she's engaged to the wrong Mr. Trist.
Perhaps I am.
Gordon, if we have some business to discuss...
In good time, Greg.
In good time.
Don't cry, Sara.
So Mildred hooked him before you could?
You still have me.
If you weren't my nephew, I...
Perish the thought, Uncle.
After all, I do want to come into your money.
Apologize to Sara, you little fool.
Make me!
I apologize.
After this, treat
Sara with some respect.
That guy's just the preliminary.
I'm probably the main event.
I'm tired of your nasty insinuations.
Now, just a minute.
Gordon!
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I think we should all have some tea.
Tea! Just what I need.
What the...
Who is it, Williams?
Same guy, Mr. Trist.
Found him snooping around the grounds, sir.
You! What are you doing here again?
You tell me.
I caught him peeping in the window.
Well, the more the merrier!
Go round up some more, Williams.
Shut up, you!
I thought I told you to get away from here and stay away!
Well, I only came back to apologize for coming back.
This time I'm going to put you out myself.
Hey, stop squeezing my Adam's apple.
I'm not squeezing your Adam's apple.
Well, how come
I can taste cider?
The lights!
What happened to the lights?
- Where's the switch?
- Look out!
- What was that?
- Somebody fell.
- There's someone on the floor.
- Billings! The lights!
- It's my husband!
- What happened to Gordon?
- Trist's been stabbed!
- There's blood!
- Uncle Gordon!
- What happened?
Give me a hand.
Just a moment.
Easy. Put her over there.
Fix that pillow.
Here we are.
Put her down easy.
Get her some water.
He's been stabbed in the back.
Probably went through to the heart.
Hey, why don't that guy pay his light bill instead of going around beating up on everybody?
What's the matter with her?
I don't feel any pulse.
Let's turn him over.
Don't touch anything!
Don't you leave! Don't anybody leave this room!
What's the matter with him?
What's the matter with everybody?
So the lights went out. What...
Police Department?
I wish to report a murder.
A murder?
Well, that's it, Lieutenant.
Thanks.
Find it yet, Roberts?
Not yet, Lieutenant.
Well, keep looking.
That knife's got to be here.
Get a matron up here to search the women.
You and Brady take care of the men.
Right, Lieutenant.
Can she talk?
I wouldn't advise it.
Severe shock.
I gave her a sedative.
How soon will it be?
Oh, a night's rest.
She'll be well enough to answer questions in the morning.
Surely you don't suspect
Mrs. Trist, Lieutenant?
I suspect everybody.
You're all in the same room, the lights go out.
When they come on again, a man is dead.
No one left the room.
Someone in here has to be the murderer.
Someone here stabbed Gordon Trist to death in the dark.
They wiped the blood off the knife on the murdered man's sleeve and hid the knife.
A clever job of hiding, but we'll find it.
We'll find it, no matter where it's hidden.
Any luck, Foster?
Nothing here, Lieutenant.
Oh, you don't think that I...
I don't think until I'm sure, but you were fighting with the murdered man when the lights went out.
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.
When the lights went out,
I hid in the piano, so I wouldn't get hurt.
Piano?
Take that piano apart, Charlie.
Yes, sir.
Say, Lieutenant, I think you're barking up the wrong tree.
Now, I've seen a lot of murders, in the movies.
And though you never suspect it until the end of the picture, the murderer is always the...
I'd like to hear some more of your bright ideas.
Take them all down to the station, boys.
Oh, relax, honey.
That guy has squirmed out of your life for good.
But I'm worried.
I wish I'd heard from him.
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.
Gordon Trist, Los Angeles
Commissioner of Sanitation was stabbed to death tonight at his palatial home in Bel Air.
Among the suspects being held by the police in connection with the fatal stabbing are Red Jones, a Fuller Brush Man, and...
Well, you've heard from him.
We've gone over that room with everything from a currycomb to a fluoroscope.
Ten experts with every gadget, electronic whatnot and gimmick known to science and still no murder weapon.
We're dealing with a very clever person.
It's always the butler.
Let Wallick and
Miss Elliot come in.
They've been here all night, too.
Ann!
Oh, Red, what happened?
You didn't really do what they're saying?
We'll determine that,
Miss Elliot.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
That's quite all right.
Glad to be of service.
Is this yours?
It is.
I loaned it to Red Jones.
Why did you loan it to him?
Well, it was the result of a foolish bet he'd forced upon me, with Miss Elliot as the stake.
He's always been jealous of my attentions to Ann, extremely jealous.
Why, I never knew when he might turn his violence upon me.
But you're going to know now, if you don't stop lying.
Look, all I wanted to do was to prove
I could sell Fuller Brushes, and I did.
You've got a satisfied customer right in this room.
Mrs. Trist.
I never bought anything from this man.
My husband threw him out.
That's the last I saw of him until our chauffeur discovered him last night.
Look, I know you're upset over what happened.
But remember out on the lawn, you bought the brushes from me?
Oh, what is this?
You've got to make her remember.
I did sell those brushes.
Honest I did.
Look, what are you trying to pull anyway?
Lieutenant, I've been through a severe shock.
Must I stand for this?
This man's obviously guilty.
He hated Gordon for throwing him out of the department.
Oh, I was sore, but I didn't...
You were fighting with Gordon just before he was killed.
Yeah, but I didn't...
Accept my congratulations, Jones.
I'm glad you got rid of my uncle.
He was a no-good, dirty chiseler.
Dirty is right.
For a Commissioner of Sanitation, he sure left me in a mess.
I didn't!
Have some turkey, Mr. Jones.
Mr. Prosecutor, are you trying to get something into me or get something out of me?
You two have been firing questions at me for 48 hours.
I'm still not guilty and I'm not very hungry.
Oh, go ahead, it won't hurt you.
It's dead, just like Gordon Trist.
Here, carve it yourself.
Oh, you're sure this is not a job for the coroner?
Hmm, you handle that knife very well.
Thank you.
Now, look, I didn't kill him.
And I don't like your a la carte insinuations.
Oh, come now, we're treating you like an honored guest.
Oh?
Although we know you're guilty.
If you play ball with us, we'll treat you even nicer.
Oh?
What's the matter,
Mr. Jones, nervous?
Nervous? Me?
No. What have I got to be nervous about?
I told you I was innocent.
Strong coffee.
Weak cups.
Will you excuse us a moment, please?
Oh, come back anytime.
Well, there's no doubt about it, you serve the finest third degree in town.
Got a match?
I didn't do it!
Looks like our little chum is going to stay mum.
If I can't locate that murder weapon,
I've got to let him go.
We've held him 48 hours.
Without the murder weapon,
I can't bring him before the grand jury.
Mmm, maybe I can't hold him after tomorrow, but I'll have him tailed, wire his apartment, tap his phone, read his mail, and water his geraniums if I have to.
In all my years as District Manager, this is the first time our name has been associated with scandal.
Lieutenant, have you seen these?
"Fuller Brush Man's motto, buy or die!"
"Doorknocker knocks off reluctant customer."
Can't you do something about this horrible publicity?
Take it up with Jones.
We're letting him go.
Letting him go?
After what he's done to the good name of Fuller Brushes?
And he wasn't even a Fuller Brush Man.
Just a freelance idiot!
You can't hang a man for that in my office.
Well, you can in mine.
For you, Lieutenant.
Quint speaking.
Oh, hello, Ferguson.
How's it going?
We're in Jones' apartment.
Testing behind the radiator now.
It's all wired for sound.
Yeah, the acoustics are perfect.
You can hear a shoelace being tied.
You can release Jones now.
Fine. Stand by.
Here's an okay on Jones.
Let him go.
Yes, sir.
Did you say
Mr. Jones is innocent?
I said we're letting him go free.
Oh, thank heaven.
Now, listen, Ann, you're not going to waste any more sympathy on that...
Shut up, Wallick!
And next time you feel magnanimous about helping morons, remember, charity begins at home.
Oh, it's not Mr. Wallick's fault.
It was all my idea.
You see, I thought that if Red could make a go of being a Fuller Brush Man, that, well, I thought that...
Oh, what's the difference?
I'm sorry, Mr. Seward.
And don't worry about me wasting sympathy on him anymore.
I realize now that he's...
He's hopeless.
Well, thanks for everything!
You must sleep over at my place some time.
Oh, hi, Ann.
I'm sorry about all of this, but it wasn't my fault.
Now that I'm going to be a Fuller
Brush Man, things will be different.
I'll be the biggest thing that ever hit the Fuller Brush Company.
It might be just the opposite.
Mr. Seward!
Now that I've cleared myself, maybe I could come up to the office and have that little talk.
You'd better not, because then I might be up for murder.
And I wouldn't want to be up for murdering you.
I've got too good a motive.
And as for you, well, I'll speak to both of you in the morning.
Oh, that's swell. Now maybe
I'll lose my dealership.
I only worked
12 years to build it up and this chowderhead tore it down in one day.
What's everybody so touchy about?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Just the same old thing.
Red Jones has done it again.
Mr. Trouble.
Open a door for him and he brings the house down on your head.
Oh, you're great, Red.
You lost this chance even before you started.
And you dragged your friends in with you.
I always expect the worst from you and you never let me down.
Who gets this?
That might as well be me.
I'm always left holding the bag.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was my apartment.
It is, Mr. Jones.
Now look, sis, I don't know what you want to buy, but this time I ain't selling.
Is that any way to greet a visitor?
You don't seem very glad to see me.
After all, I was very nice to you when you called at my house.
I'm sorry.
Make yourself at home, but not in my home.
Please?
Check it somewhere else, sister!
Hey, what was the idea of telling those cops you didn't buy any brushes from me?
I was only trying to help you.
Help me?
Yeah.
Help me get a fast ride down that last mile.
But you're wrong.
If they knew we'd met and talked before, they might think we're in this together.
They might suspect both of us.
Poor Gordon's real murderer would go free.
Still, we are in it together, even though we're innocent.
We must work together and stick together.
Well, what about Ann?
Will you tell her you bought the brushes from me?
Of course I'll tell her.
Stay right where you are.
I hope she's not out with Wallick.
I hope she's not home with Wallick.
Hello?
Hello, Ann? This is Red.
Can you come right over to my place?
No!
Look, Red, maybe
I didn't make myself clear.
Let me put it this way.
We're through!
He said he can prove Mrs. Trist really did buy those brushes.
Oh, but I'm not falling for those ridiculous explanations any longer.
Hello.
Ann, believe me.
Mrs. Trist is in my place right now.
You've got to come over.
I'll be expecting you.
Ann's coming over and you can explain to her about the brushes.
That'll square me with her.
Hey, what's this bristle comb doing here?
I thought you bought all of these.
Now I remember.
I only had nine of them.
That must be mine, too.
Oh. Well, don't forget to pay me for them.
And while you dig up some cash,
I'll dig up some food.
Boy, am I hungry!
How's it going?
Something went haywire.
She does it every time.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
The ironing board always does that.
That's why my head's got a better press than my pants.
Come on in.
Kitchen's kind of small.
It used to be a telephone booth before the housing shortage.
Here, you chop up the onions for the salad, huh?
Nothing's coming in on the system.
You know, maybe Red is telling the truth.
After all,
Mrs. Trist could be lying.
Oh, not a chance.
Quint knows Red is guilty.
The cops just let him go so they could watch every move he makes.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Why, Lieutenant Quint wants me to make a full report.
I'm sort of working undercover for the police.
Where are you going?
I wouldn't walk out on Red when he was in trouble.
I thought he was really free.
Oh, then I'm going with you, if only to protect you.
That man is a criminal.
I'm going to see that he's brought to justice.
I really must go.
Oh, you can't leave now.
Ann will be here any minute.
You have her call me at home.
I'll tell her you sold me the brushes.
Don't go away.
Don't go away.
That's Ann.
Ann! Oh!
Hey, it isn't Ann.
Who is it?
It's that girl that was at your place.
Sara Franzen?
Yeah, that's her.
We mustn't be seen together.
Is there another way out?
Yeah, right through that window, four stories straight down.
Well, get rid of her and don't let her know I'm here.
Okay.
Just a minute!
What's wrong with this thing?
Can't you fix it?
As soon as that Trist dame came in, our volume went down.
Next time, we dump slot machines in the bay, include this.
Keep your shirt on!
Look, I'm...
I'm not used to doors slamming in my face, Mr. Jones.
Well, you can't come in.
I'm taking a bath.
With your trousers on?
Well, it's a very small tub.
I can only get half of my body in at a time.
Oh.
Dry water.
Very interesting.
Oh, all right. Come on in.
What do you want?
Is that any way to greet a visitor?
What did you say?
Is that any way to greet a visitor?
That's when we came in!
Well, what do you want to do? Scrub my back?
Mr. Jones, I just didn't know which way to turn.
Well, I got a TL for you.
You can turn around and get out of here.
Mr. Jones, please listen to me.
I just had to come to see you.
Well, you've seen all of me you're going to see.
That was Sara Franzen.
Now what's wrong with it?
It keeps the radiator warm.
Let's start talking.
You've got to help me, Mr. Jones.
You're the only one I can trust.
How come all of a sudden everybody trusts me?
I think Mrs. Trist lied to the police.
I'm almost sure I saw several new brushes in her room.
May I see the brushes in your case, please?
If they are the same kind...
You see, everybody thinks there was something between me and Gordon.
Oh, but I love his nephew.
I love Freddie.
I love him. I love him.
So you love him.
Now do you understand how I feel?
No, but I can understand how Freddie feels.
Oh, that's Ann!
Here, you can't undress in here!
How'd that get here?
Put that on!
Where?
The same place you had it before.
I mean, in here. In here.
Ann! Freddie!
Oh, it's Freddie!
Freddie? Oh, he's madly jealous of me.
If he finds me in your bedroom, he'll kill you.
Kill me?
Yes.
Why should he? You've still got your hat on.
You'd better hide in the kitchen.
I'd rather have her kill me.
Ooh! I'm sorry.
Hello, Sara.
What a cute hat.
Well, will you start peeling the onions?
Now, look, if you think you're coming in here, you got another thought coming!
Well, now that I've thought it over, please come in.
I have an idea Sara's here.
No, she's not here.
But if she comes around,
I'll tell her you were asking for her.
That's her now.
Let her in.
Don't say a word.
Let her talk. I want to listen.
That isn't Sara.
Open the door.
No, no, please, please don't go in the kitchen.
Let her in.
And remember, this gun is loaded.
So is the kitchen.
Hello, Freddie. I see you've changed from knives to guns.
It can't hurt anyone.
It isn't loaded.
Sara, what are you doing here?
Let me in.
Any of you folks expecting two tough-looking mugs?
No, and I'm getting out of here.
Use your skeleton key.
Hey, wait. I'll see if they're still out there.
Not a sound out of any of you.
Start looking.
Here, that's my good suit.
Oh, stop it, will you?
I'm responsible for these things.
This'll get us nothing.
I'm going up there.
Now look, sloppy, I don't have a maid here today.
Sit down!
Hmm?
What are you looking for, a punch in the nose?
No. What are you looking for?
Hey, you're wrecking my apartment.
What do you guys want?
Just came up to buy some brushes, Mr. Fuller.
Oh, my name's not Fuller.
You got the wrong apartment.
Shh! Stop making so much noise.
I don't mind you breaking my furniture, but don't break my lease.
Who's that?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I've been wrong every time.
Take them in there.
I'll cover the redhead.
Get rid of whoever it is.
And remember, I got you covered.
One wrong move and you get it.
I got it.
Am I intruding?
Lieutenant Quint, come in.
Am I glad to see you!
Happy and honored to have a member of the police force pay me a visit.
Yes, sir, happy to have you here, Lieutenant.
Just loosen your holster and make yourself at home.
I changed the furniture around.
I'm sure it looked better the way you had it.
Oh, no.
It was too formal.
Low on closets, eh?
No, just long on coats.
Just throw it anywhere.
Sure I'm not intruding?
No. No, not at all. You...
No. No. I was just spending a nice quiet evening at home with my books.
I'd hate to leave you alone with my books.
Oh, pardon me.
Come in.
Ann! What a surprise!
So it's true.
They still think you killed Gordon Trist.
Oh, how can you be so blind?
Red never harmed anyone in his life.
Oh, Red. They just let you go to trap you.
Say, let's get this straight.
Are you with him or against him?
With him, when he's in trouble.
Isn't that wonderful?
I'm always in trouble.
Well, I'll leave you two to kiss and make up.
I've got to go.
No, no, no, no.
Why don't you stay and trap me?
It's a good idea, but two's company.
Well, maybe I could leave you two alone.
That is, I'll fix you a sandwich or something.
We'd love for him to stay, wouldn't we, Ann?
No. And by the way, where's Mrs. Trist?
You said she was here.
That ought to prove something to you, Lieutenant.
Trist? She thought
I said Trist.
Prist. Mrs. Prist.
She's the one with the low-slung jaw like that, see?
Her husband was a heavy smoker and he married her so he'd have an extra ashtray.
What did Mrs. Prist come here for?
Well, you can never understand what she says.
You've got to lean over like this and...
Come to think of it, I will stay.
I haven't eaten today.
Well, if you'll remember,
I haven't, either.
This time we'll forget the questions and concentrate on our little tummies, huh?
Ann, you entertain the Lieutenant.
I'll go get things going.
Well, can't I help?
I want to talk to you.
Oh, no, no.
You know how small the kitchen is and...
You stay with the Lieutenant.
Get rid of that flatfoot.
I can't. He's hungry.
He wants something to eat.
Better eat, too, redhead.
This may be your last supper.
Oh. There goes my appetite.
Here, peel the potatoes, will you?
And you open up a can of stew and you fix the coffee.
Can't you peel a smaller one?
Yeah.
Nice gun you got.
Yeah.
Hmm. You're quite handy in the kitchen.
Sure you didn't have some help in there?
No. No, I learned to cook from my mother.
Her specialty was stew.
She threw everything in the pot except what we were going to wear that day.
So nothing unusual happened since you left my office, eh?
No. Nothing unusual.
And that's unusual.
Well, if you have any visitors, let me know. I've got to be going now.
I'll see you to the door, Lieutenant.
You're going?
Well, you haven't had your coffee yet.
Wait, I'll get it.
Why hasn't that guy gone yet?
He's going as soon as he has his coffee.
Don't kid me.
And remember, one word out of you to that guy and you're going to end up in a detective story magazine, air conditioned.
I won't say a word.
I'll join you in a cup of coffee,
Lieutenant, if you'll jump in first.
Come and get it while it's hot, Lieutenant.
Oh, and it's hot.
- Where is he?
- He just left...
Where?
He had to go...
Here, Lieutenant, how will you have your sugar?
With one or two cups of coffee?
Have some more cream, Quint.
You look as if you could stand some more weight.
Just dunk away.
Roll up your sleeves there.
You can't catch cold as long as you keep your elbows dry.
Red, for heaven sakes...
There's two gorillas here with guns.
- Guns?
- Who has guns?
Why, Lieutenant Quint has guns, look.
Look at the size of those pistols.
Why, they're big enough for elephants.
'Course I never saw an elephant carry a gun.
Did you say gorillas?
No, no, no. Elephants.
I understand you're quite a crack shot, Lieutenant.
Why, they tell me you can split a wet noodle lengthwise at 50 yards.
There's two guys here with guns.
One's in the kitchen, the other's in the bedroom.
That's right, son.
I used to be a big game hunter.
Got so I didn't have to shoot critters.
They see me coming, they just up and surrender.
Oh, that's good.
Red!
Mmm-hmm?
Red, why don't you put the furniture back?
Why?
Block the doors.
And I'll pour Lieutenant Quint another cup of coffee.
That's a good idea.
Hold your cup, Lieutenant.
Give him a lot of it.
I'm going to the Trist house.
I'll check with you from there.
Yeah, things are beginning to make some sense now.
Looks like Mrs. Trist is in this with Red.
Right. Keep that recorder going.
How does the chair look here, Lieutenant?
Well, the only chair
I know anything about is wired for electricity.
Boy, is he corny.
He'll pay for that remark.
That reminds me of a joke, Lieutenant.
Now, don't stop me if you've heard it because I'm dying to hear it again.
It seems there was a fellow about to be electrocuted and the warden said to him,
"Do you have any last wish?"
And the guy says, "Yeah.
I wish you was sitting on my lap."
Yeah, you should have stopped me.
That'll hold 'em.
Come on.
Noticed anything peculiar about the coffee?
No. It should have been good to the last bristle.
Hey, this is the brush
Mrs. Trist wanted.
Well, what's it doing in the coffeepot?
Mmm.
Hey, look, that plastic, it's soft, it bends.
Look how that stretches.
This must be the brush those gorillas were looking for.
Oh, why did Lieutenant Quint have to leave?
Hey, Skitch!
They've got the brush!
Help! Get out of the place.
The building's on fire! Hurry!
There's an earthquake. Hurry!
Help! Help! Help!
There's a fire in the house.
At least this'll get your mother out of the house.
...automobiles right away.
We're taking orders for automobiles.
There's a fire.
Immediate delivery.
Get out fast.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
We've got to get this to Lieutenant Quint.
It must be important.
Everybody wants it.
You're right, Red.
What's going on here, Ann?
I won't have you consorting with this criminal.
Get in, Red.
Quick! Quick!
Come on, step on the gas.
Get going.
Oh, not me!
I'm not helping any murderer to escape.
Police! Help! Help!
Well, that ought to help. Hurry.
Come on!
Get going! Hurry!
I'm gone.
Don't you see?
This is a clue.
It must be a clue.
Somebody hid it in the coffeepot.
I've got to get it to Quint.
He's got to know about it.
Please, Sergeant.
Where is he?
A clue.
The next thing you'll be telling me,
Trist was murdered with a brush.
Hey, he's right.
Trist was murdered with this brush.
Why didn't we think of that?
Oh, Sergeant, you're wonderful.
Sure. Sure.
I even know how it happened.
The murderer tickled him to death.
Listen, lady, I can't send you to Quint with those goofy ideas.
He'd hand me back my traffic whistle and tell me to blow my brains out.
We'll take that chance.
Sure, where is he?
At the Trist house.
Come on.
You'll take that chance?
Is Lieutenant Quint here?
Who is it, Billings?
It's that brush person.
Where's Lieutenant Quint?
He just left.
Where'd he go?
Oh, we've got to find him.
I'm sorry.
He didn't say where he was going.
Selling brushes at this hour,
Mr. Jones?
Not this one. This one's for Lieutenant Quint.
It's the murder weapon.
Oh, come now, Mr. Jones.
Hasn't your company had enough publicity out of this tragedy?
You think I'm kidding, huh?
Where's your kitchen?
Kitchen? Don't tell me a Fuller Brush is also good to eat.
No. But this one stopped somebody from eating.
Come on.
Now watch.
The boiling water will make that handle soft and you can bend it into any shape you want.
Now, that's exactly what the murderer did.
Extremely interesting, but why didn't the police find that brush after the murder?
Surely, a handle that shape would have attracted attention.
Look, Red, it's softening.
Look.
It is.
It's changing its shape.
Hey, it's going back to its original form.
Jones, you've hit it.
I read about that stuff in a magazine.
Plastic with a memory, it's called.
No matter what you do to it, it always returns to its original shape when it's heated.
And that's how the murderer hid the weapon.
After the murder, the brush was heated again and thrown on the floor with my brushes.
It looked like one of the regular brushes.
Oh, good heavens.
I've been carrying it around with me.
Hey, Mrs. Trist was going to serve tea.
There was boiling water in that teapot.
You don't think it was Mrs. Trist, do you?
Why, I don't know, but she bought the brushes.
And she came to your apartment tonight.
She tried awful hard to get this brush away from me.
I can't believe it.
Well, I can.
It must be her.
Lieutenant Quint's got to see about...
Mr. Cruckston, telephone, sir.
Oh, excuse me.
That's all right.
Come on. We're going back to the police headquarters.
Oh.
This may square you with me.
Hello. Yes, this is Gregory Cruckston.
Bad news, Chief.
That Jones guy got away.
He's here with me.
Get Skitch and the boys and wait at the warehouse.
Okay, Chief.
We'll be waiting for you.
We'll be right down.
Yes, I'll bring Mr. Jones with me.
Who was that?
Lieutenant Quint.
He wants us down at my warehouse.
We haven't a minute to lose.
He's uncovered some new evidence.
Oh, is that right? Is it Mrs. Trist?
I bet he knew it all the time.
He didn't say.
...and that's why I had to come and see you, Lieutenant.
It seemed more than coincidence the murder weapon and the brush I bought from Mr. Jones should have disappeared at the same time.
The notion struck me that they could be one and the same.
Interesting theory,
Mrs. Trist.
We've been working on that ourselves.
There are some, however, who believe your husband was tickled to death.
I found the missing brush tonight at Mr. Jones' apartment.
When those two hoodlums started looking for a brush, I...
I realized I was on the right track.
I was afraid they'd find it on me, so I hid it in the coffeepot hoping you'd find it.
Hmm. Nice of you to let us into your confidence, Mrs. Trist.
First, you didn't buy brushes from Jones.
Now it seems you did buy brushes from Jones.
See she isn't disturbed while she makes up her mind.
I'm telling you the truth, Lieutenant.
That's all, Mrs. Trist.
Oh, no, Lieutenant.
Not again, please.
Certainly is dark here.
And damp.
We're near the waterfront.
Sure is a spooky place to have an office.
Telephone's ringing.
"War Surplus Warehouse."
We sell our goods in stores all over the country.
The entrance is right over here.
Hey, you know, I bought a walkie-talkie at a war surplus store.
It was good for talking, but I couldn't get it to walk.
Gordon Trist was my silent partner.
Yeah, he's pretty silent right now, ain't he?
Afraid so. While he was alive, he used his influence to help me buy up millions of dollars worth of war materials.
Yeah?
Hey, what a wonderful spot for a murder.
Oh, Red, don't talk like that.
Well, it is, isn't it,
Mr. Cruckston?
I couldn't think of a better place.
Yeah.
You know, I've been reconstructing the crime in my mind.
I should be working with the homicide bureau.
Philo Jones, that's me.
You know, you're right about Mrs. Trist.
If she weren't guilty, she would never have denied buying those brushes.
Yeah, that's her story, but her husband got stuck with it.
Look, first thing she did was to take a brush and shape it like a knife.
Then she wheeled in the teacart.
The lights go out.
There's a body on the floor.
She takes the weapon and drops it into the teapot.
Now the lights come up.
She takes the weapon out of the teapot, but it's an ordinary brush again.
She throws it on the floor with my brushes and...
Well, I'm fired from the homicide bureau.
Well, what's wrong?
Well, how could she take the brush out of the teapot if she were unconscious or pretending to be when the lights came on?
She could have had an accomplice.
Hmm. That's it.
Someone must have helped her.
Now, let's see.
Who was standing close by the boiling water?
There was the butler and the maid.
Now, the butler or the maid, either one could have helped kill Mr. Trist.
Everybody has servant problems.
Were they near the teacart?
Yeah, and they weren't just reading tea leaves, either.
And the only other ones were Mrs. Trist...
The maid, the butler and who, Mr. Jones?
Oh, I just remembered.
You were right beside the teacart.
Can you imagine?
For a second I thought he did it.
Why, that's a good one.
Why, what dopes we'd be to come to a deserted warehouse if he were the murderer.
That would mean that this is all just a gag and that Lieutenant Quint wouldn't be in the office and we'd be a couple of dead ducks.
Because he'd be sure to kill us.
Wouldn't want us to tell how the murder was committed.
Be quite a little joke on us, eh, Mr. Cruckston?
You'll probably die laughing.
Now, get in there!
Oh, Red, it was him!
He did it!
Now she tells me.
All right, break up the game.
Okay, we're on our last hand now.
Four aces.
Got the boat ready?
Our friends are taking a trip.
Boat?
Oh, I can't stand boats.
I get seasick.
I'd just be a nuisance.
Why don't you fellows go by yourselves?
Come on, boys.
We'll finish the game when we get back.
Oh, now don't let us interrupt.
We don't want to break up their game, do we?
Especially after you've got all those extra aces.
What do you mean, extra aces?
Oh, I saw you hide them under the blotter.
Murder's one thing, but cheating at cards...
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Never mind that!
Come on. Get going.
You don't think he was cheating, huh? Well, look.
Hurry!
Come on, I'll catch you.
Who left all these walnut shells around?
You murdering kidnapper.
Now I've got you.
Sorry, Mr. Wallick.
Slow me down!
Slow me down!
I got him, fellas.
I got him. Call the cops.
Sorry, Mr. Wallick!
Ooh!
Oh, no!
Come on!
Oh, Red, what are we going to do?
There's no way out of here.
Well, here, put this over the door.
I thought
I stepped on you at first.
Here, maybe we can get some help with these.
I used a walkie-talkie in the Army.
Oh, it's too late.
They're coming!
Well, well, here.
Blow this up.
How?
It's simple.
You pull this.
Here, put it against the door.
Where did you go?
Uh-huh. Right here.
Oh!
Here, pull it up there.
I'll tune these in on every wavelength.
Someone's bound to hear us.
Help, police.
Come to the Cruckston Warehouse.
Help, police!
Now, a message from our sponsor.
Help, help, police!
Come to the Cruckston Warehouse!
Those commercials are getting sillier every day!
Help, police! Beaver Patrol to the rescue! Help, police!
Blow up some more!
Help, police!
Come to the Cruckston Warehouse!
And now, the celebrated fashion designer, Jean Louis, will give us his opinion of the new longer dresses.
Blow 'em up. Blow 'em up!
Get air in 'em. Blow 'em up!
And now, we shall hear the senator from Massachusetts, who will speak on what the government should do about big business.
Blow 'em up. Blow 'em up!
Hurry, blow 'em up!
That's the Democrats for you!
Help, police! Come to the Cruckston Warehouse!
There he is.
Come on!
Come here, you!
Help!
Leave her alone!
Help! Red!
Get your dirty hands off of her!
Take your dirty hands off that girl.
I told you to take your hands off her.
Leave her alone!
Come here, you!
- I told you to leave her alone!
- Red!
Hurry!
Help!
Leaping Leo, the Bulgarian Backbreaker is trying for a hammerlock.
The champion is fighting back.
It's anyone's match.
It's a real fight, folks.
The Bulgarian Backbreaker is down.
He's taking a terrific beating.
Listen to him yell.
Help! Help!
Oh, someone please help!
Leave me alone! Help!
Come to the Cruckston
Warehouse. Help! Help!
And this is what a satisfied user of Simon's Sausage has to say about
Simon's Sausage...
Help! They're killing me!
We can't hold out much longer.
That's right. They always give me heartburn.
Hurry! Hurry!
Come to the Cruckston Warehouse.
Hurry, please! Help!
Lieutenant Quint, come to the
Cruckston Warehouse, please! Help!
Help, help, help!
Help! Help!
Help! They're killing me!
And when you smoke that fresh cigarette, Old Bluckies, your throat will feel like this...
Help! Help!
They're killing me!
Blow up some more.
I am. I'm blowing.
Blow 'em up!
That brings to a close our program of slumber music.
Here, take these, in case of an emergency.
Blow 'em up. Blow 'em up!
Get air in 'em!
Blow 'em up!
The Thin Man must have lived here.
Come on!
I wonder if there's a diner on this train.
You know, this looks familiar.
Steal my girl and car, will you?
Hurry. Get up there!
All right.
Here I come, ready or not.
Go away, boys.
We want to be alone!
Steady. Steady.
Oh, Red.
This is a fine time to play see-saw.
Wish I'd worn my heavier girdle.
Here, here, here, I know you like pretzels, but let's not overdo it.
Knucklehead'll need some new knuckles!
And all I wanted to do was to sell Fuller Brushes.
Even with his ears it fits!
Come on.
Get on my back!
You're going backwards!
I can't see where I'm going.
Take your finger out of my mouth.
I'm not a baby.
They're catching me!
Here, put your feet in my pockets and stop squirming around, will you?
Stop hanging on my eyelids!
My nose, my nose, let go of my nose!
Hey, I'm beginning to feel like a wishbone.
Jump!
Jump? Oh, you're kidding!
Let go of that!
Ow!
Oh, get away, boys.
You bother me.
Oh!
Oh! Don't!
Hey, get me off of here!
Oh, turn off this Mixmaster!
Red, here they come!
Keep going!
Someone has to get flattened out.
Where do we go from here?
You better jump.
I'll try to balance this.
Red, are you all right?
Good morning, madam.
Would you like to buy a brush?
Gee, I hate to break up their pinochle game.
Now I got you, you killer!
I got him, fellas! I got him!
Stop it!
Sorry, Mr. Wallick!
Here, put him under here.
Who are you?
I'm Mr. Wallick.
Sorry, Mr. Wallick.
Thank you. Oh, no, don't hit me!
Take that!
Come on, just when
I'm getting to enjoy this.
I can't stand up!
Well, here comes the Rover Boys again.
Red! Oh!
Hey, get your foot out of my mouth!
Red! Red!
Watch it, Red!
I haven't been so crowded since I slept with...
Red!
Red, come on, hurry! Oh!
Hey, let go. Let go!
You're killing me.
I can't hold on much longer.
You'd better. You won't like it down there.
Begging your pardon, sir.
But you seem to be leaving with my portion of the money.
Get out of here.
Not until I get what's coming to me.
I carried out your plan.
I expect you to live up to the rest of our agreement.
What are you going to do?
For delivering one dead gentleman,
I merely wanted my share.
Now it seems if I deliver two dead gentlemen, I can have both shares.
It's always the butler, sir.
Fine camouflage net.
Everywhere I go, they see me.
Hold onto Jones!
Don't let him get away!
Get the girl!
...then we had the FCC mobile unit put a fix on the call.
They traced it to a waterfront warehouse.
Cruckston's in San Pedro.
A guy named Red Jones was calling for you, Lieutenant.
Red Jones?
Let's get going, boys.
Oh, no! No, not me!
Oh! My foot!
Red!
Oh, my leg! My leg!
You burned my foot off.
Red, the Fire Department!
They're here!
We're saved!
Get this window open.
It won't open.
We can let them know we're up here.
Hey, I'll send up a flare.
Stand back!
Now, one move and
I'll fill you so full of flares, you'll be able to read by your own light.
Red, the door's over here. Come on.
Stand back, fellas.
I don't want any more trouble with you.
You keep on and you're gonna...
You'll end up like a pinball machine.
Oh, it's locked, Red!
Tilt it.
Heh! Now you want to be a glowworm, huh?
Back up. Go on.
Get over to the window.
We got to get word to the fire chief.
Help! Help!
Those are the right words, only say them louder.
Where's the fire?
Fire? There's no fire.
No fire? We got the alarm from here.
There must be some mistake, Captain.
There's no one here but me.
You can see for yourself.
There's no fire.
And who are you?
I'm Mr. Cruckston's man, sir.
He sent for me to bring down the car and wait for him here.
Okay. False alarm, boys.
Probably a short circuit.
We're up here! Help! Help!
They don't hear me.
Well, keep yelling.
Help!
Oh, Red, the fire engines are leaving.
Oh, no.
Well, there's only one thing to do is send up the flare.
Hey, put that down!
Get back! Don't ever do that again!
Don't just stand there.
Do something!
I'll do something.
Get over there!
Get over there, will you?
Go on! Get. You, too, get over there.
Get up against the wall.
Get over there.
Now, I'm going to let you have it.
Well, I wonder if this company was investigated.
Back up! Back up or I'll light this.
So help me, I'll light it.
You'd better back up...
Oh, I've lit it! Help!
Turn around and go back!
Look, I don't mind carrying a torch for you, but this is ridiculous.
Where are you going?
Grab 'em, boys!
I'll get a pull motor.
No, I'm all right.
Are you all right, Red?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
You all right? Oh.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Arrest that man.
Why? Is there a law against it?
What a kiss.
What a Fuller Brush Man.

A hundred years ago - the island of
St. Pierre in the English Channel.
This came for you,
Reverend Mother.
Thank you.
Reverend Mother and Friend.
A bad penny always turns up and -
- this useless aging one returns home today.
If my beloved Sophie is still living after all this time -
- please tell her I have not forgotten the great love we -
He needn't wait.
- respectfully, a voice from the past
Edmond Ozanne
Thank you, you needn't wait.
Open the gate, sister Angelique.
Forgive me, Reverend Mother -
If you're going to St. Pierre, the tide is due to rise.
And if you should get caught!
Child!
The matter of this letter may ruin the happiness of a family we all respect!
Of course, I could stay here and pray to the good Lord.
Yes, you could that, Reverend Mother!
You're not so young any more!
But I think the good Lord would prefer me to do something about it!
And my age is my own business.
And you could come with me!
Sophie.
Reverend Mother, how nice to see you!
Do sit down!
No, no, I haven't time for that.
- But I haven't seen you for years!
- Sophie!
Is something wrong?
Edmond Ozanne, has returned to St Pierre.
Edmond!
Naturally, he doesn't know you'r Mrs. Patourel.
And he wants to see you!
There is my answer!
My two daughters.
You don't mention Octavius?
Don't you love him?
Octavius, of course!
He is my husband.
You didn't love him when your parents forced the marriage on you.
Octavius is kind and devoted!
He has been a loving father to his children, he has carried on the family business beautifully!
But Edmond is still the man you love!
And always will.
My parents forbade me to marry Edmond.
Because he drank too much.
And talked to much!
Because they considered the marriage unsuitable.
Don't lie to me, Sophie Patourel!
You would have thrown yourself over the cliff that night!
If I hadn't stopped you!
Help me! Help me,
Reverend Mother!
Octavius think I scarcely knew Edmond.
He and my children must never know the truth!
You must go and see
Edmond today.
Tell him about your marriage.
Your daughters.
Let him know unmistakenly that the past is buried forever!
And he will say nothing to jeopardize your family's happiness.
Yes, I'll see him!
I'll go today!
Good!
Now I must hurry. The tide may not wait, even for Mother Superior!
There's Edmond now.
Oh, Mrs Metivier, you flatter me.
He has changed.
Shockingly.
Cabby, let's have this bag first, eh?
Who is the young man?
That is his son.
Edmond married in England his wife died when the boy was born.
Come, sister.
Goodbye, my child.
Goodbye, Reverend Mother.
Mama, help me get my bonnet on properly!
Naturally, darling.
Marianne, Marianne!
I won't be long, I'm with papa.
I wrote to London this morning -
- and told them not to send you the plans for the steam boat.
Marianne, why don't you get married?
And I signed your name to the letter.
You what?
I said, I signed your name to the letter!
Marianne, it is most unseemingly!
Oh nonsens, Papa, these are modern times!
I have made up my mind.
You must marry!
Sir Charles, that's our man.
You must know that he loves you.
Don't think Mama and I didn't notice that you spent three hours with him in the conservatory last night!
Yes.
Yes, it took me three solid hours to coax sir Charles to give me this report.
You see it is marked "confidential".
Here it is.
Your new glasses.
These figures prove that at present cost of operations -
- the steam boat will eat upp all its profits.
I still say it is most unseemingly for a young woman to know so much about the shipping business.
Papa!
You'll be using steam ships in eight or ten years.
By that time you will be retired and I will be running the business.
By that time you'll be married to some smart young fellow who carry on in my place.
If I ever marry -
- it won't be because the bride groom is a good business man!
Marianne my dear, sometimes you shock me!
Of course I do.
I'm bold and scheming.
And sometimes I think
I'm not quite nice!
Marianne, Marguerite is waiting.
Oh, be an angel and run down and tell Mama -
- that in exactly five minutes -
- I shall descend upon the staircase so elegantly -
- I'll frighten myself!
You're incorrigible!
Marguerite.
Marianne, you're beautiful!
Simply beautiful!
I am not beautiful!
I'm immensly chique!
Smell.
It's a new perfume from Paris.
I think it's a little indecent, don't you?
Marianne, the neckline of that dress, do you think it modest?
Mama, it's the very latest style!
Papa my angel, what do you think?
Is it all too bold?
Not on you, my dear.
God has given you that quality.
Oh no, it's all my own doing!
Now, now, Marianne, don't be rude to your father!
Go where you're going before I lose my patience!
We're going shopping, come on!
Shopping? In that dress?
But Mama, this dress is only to prove - that even if we are the richest people on the island we are not snobs!
- At least I'm not!
- As a matter of fact I feel particularly common!
What are we going shopping for?
We are not going shopping.
We are calling on our new neighbours.
Both of them.
Look alive you, young whipper-snapper!
Come in, come in!
Well, bless my soul -
- if you aren't a pretty pair!
William, come and see what I've got!
A pink one and a green one.
Are there any more of you outside? A yellow one or a blue one?
William, make your manners.
Bow to thelittle dears.
This is my son William.
And your name is?
- Marianne, and you are sweet.
- Well, thank you!
And yours?
Marguerite.
Marianne and Marguerite.
Two pretty names for two pretty little dears!
Holy Moses, I don't know I've ever heard two prettier names.
Did you, William?
I don't like them. Too fancy and too much alike!
He's a viscious little brute, isn't he?
Now, sit down, ladies!
I've been trying to save him from the likes of you ever since the day he was born!
I've never saw them until this minute.
Oh, he doesn't mean saving you from us!
He means from good manners, respectability, sobriety.
Please don't be angry with her, she talks like that to everybody.
- Angry with her, why, if I were a young man I'd ...
- You'd what?
I'd run away as if you were the devil himself!
And a fine job you'd made of yourself and your son.
If it is impossible you can be your son?
Impossible?
What's wrong?
Well, you can start making yourself civilized.
By tying your shoe laces.
I wouldn't give a penny for all the civilized shoe laces in London!
A revolutionary? And just what would be your idea of a satisfactory existence?
If I were running this world
I would pass a law that -
- everyone could do exactly as he pleased!
Convincing rascal, isn't he?
Ladies, I am Ozanne, doctor Edmond Ozanne.
And you are Marianne and
Marguerite what?
- Excuse me, please!
I'm afraid my daughters are rather unconventional.
Naturally one calls on a new neighbour but not without warning of course.
I am Mrs Patourel, you remember me?
And you are Edmond Ozanne.
- Yes, Mam.
And you are Sophie.
- We used to know each other when we were -
- Yes, I was just about to tell your daughters that I didn't know you very well.
My father being a shop keeper -
- on a lower social level -
- than your mother's family.
- Oh, Edmond, that make us sound like snobs!
- Oh, but you are Mama! You are sweet, but you are a snob.
- Pay no attention to her.
My husband ...
I don't think you ever knew him.
His name is Octavius Patourel.
- And he's a bit of snob too!
- Close your mouth, young woman!
Your mother is a gracious lady.
Merely trying to be kind to a -
- good for nothing who drinks more than is good for him.
- Oh, Edmond!
- Yes, I ...
The only times I ever really got away from this island ...
What I left behind here ...
Is through a bottle of ...
But I won't presume on boyhood acquaintanceship.
Ah, I forgot! My son!
Salute the lady, William!
You are very like your father as a boy.
Let's go now.
Come girls!
Good bye, doctor Ozanne.
I'm coming again, soon.
An honour, young lady!
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, William!
- Goodbye, William.
You would look much more like a human being if you combed your hair!
- Thank you Edmond for helping me out!
They mustn't ever know that you and I once ...
- Once loved each other beyond all else.
Don't worry, Sophie.
No one will ever hear it from these -
- aging lips.
And which of the two young ladies put that comb in your hand?
- It was Marianne.
Or is her name Marguerite?
It was the nice one!
- Why, thank you!
Who sent them?
- Oh, this is nice.
- There are two of them.
- Well, shouldn't Miss Marianne Patourel be told the name of her secret admirer who sent her flowers?
- She doesn't even know I exist and she never will.
- I'll go and tell her!
- You keep your mouth shut, Corinne, and mind you own business!
Since when has Timothy Haslam not been my business?
What is over is over -
- I have told you that a thousand times, now, can't you understand it?
- I can understand.
But will my brother understand?
You know he can use a knife too!
That statue of the Madonna up there, how tall is it?
No one has ever seen it close.
Except for the Sisters of Saint Peter.
William, I've been thinking over very seriously what you said about shoe laces the other day.
Can you get up there from here?
Well, they say that many years ago -
- before the convent was built -
- smugglers used to climb up through a tunnel inside the cave!
- Smugglers, huh?
Well, I can do anything a smuggler can do!
- William!
- Pretty smart of those old smugglers.
You know, at high tide the whole cave is hidden under water.
And at low tide it is perfect for ...
- Sit down, William!
Now, what are you going to do about your future?
- My future?
I think I'll be a smuggler!
- Please be serious!
A man must have some sort of career.
- I will have to think that over, it may take years and years.
In the meantime -
- I think I'll just lie back here.
And think of all the exciting places on the other side of that ocean.
The Pacific Ocean and all the others.
- Good morning, Emily.
- Good morning, Miss Marianne!
- Good morning, Dolly.
- Good morning, Miss.
- Marianne.
- Pleasant dreams?
- Very!
Marianne?
It is possible to fall in love with a man -
- that you've only known for five days?
And seen three times?
- Yes, I think it is!
- That means you're in love with him too?
- No I'm not, but I could be in love with the man he could be.
- Whichever of us?
Oh Marianne, it must never make any difference between us!
- Nothing ever could or ever will!
- How can William not fall in love with you?
You're so striking.
And you have a brain.
- William.
- Yes, father?
- There you are!
William, did you drink as much as I did last night?
- I did, old fellow, but
I'm young.
- You ungrateful young cub!
- Father, Marguerite is coming.
- The sign says "Doctor Ozanne".
- Come this way, please.
Sit there.
Hey, here's a patient for you!
- What's the matter, getting a little trouble?
Holy Moses, that's bad!
You've lost a lot of blood.
It's a knife wound, eh?
It's a matter for the police.
I'll have to report it.
- No!
- I always have to report knife wounds.
- I don't need you to.
- Well, give me one good reason why I shouldn't.
- Because it's a private matter.
- A woman, huh? And the man who carved you up was her husband?
- Her brother.
- Brother?
Very dull and uninteresting.
Well.
Nothing better for the morning after than a little surgery.
- What's the matter, do
I fright you that much?
Yes. You are so blasted clever, you scare me to death!
- Good. Perhaps I can scare some sense into you!
Come down to the harbour,
I want to show you something.
- A beautiful ship!
What is she, Marianne?
- One of the new clippers. The finest, fastest kind of merchant ship.
You see, William? You see the name? The Green Dolphin.
And you live on the corner of
Green Dolphin Street. That's a sign!
Look how high those masts are!
I wonder how many sails she carries?
Well, there's a fore-topmast , staysail, inner jib, outer or flying jib, foursail, mainsail and mizzen, fitted with topsail, topgallants and royals.
What would you be doing here?
Where can one get the first good sleep I've had in a week!
Do you know what a storm it was that drew me here last night?
Where are you from and what cargo?
From New Zealand, a cargo of timber.
Well, you've got the most perfect ship I've ever seen!
Captain Dennis O'Hara at your service!
Come aboard and have a bite of breakfast!
That's the mark of a shark!
Caught it in the Tasman Sea with a boat hook!
Yes, New Zealand is a beautiful country.
With forests, half of them grand swell.
And the top of trees are a 150 feet above your head.
And giant ferns below, ferns reaching above your shoulders.
- Giant ferns?
- Go on, captain O'Hara!
It's the first I've ever seen William -
- interested in anything worthwhile!
- Yes, a grand land!
With birds bigger than an ostrich!
But not able to fly for the reason of the heavy stomach they have on them.
And mountains with the snow always on their crests.
Slipped ashore last night, did you?
Stole the eggs off the natives?
It's meself, I'm proud of you for that!
Doesn't your servant talk English?
Not, he don't talk sense at all!
Some cannibals in New Zealand tied with his tongue.
That's why.
Cannibals?
Chopped off his leg too!
A grand country, New Zealand!
With timber and flax, and wonderful pasture land!
All virgin soil, and don't belong to no one!
There are places like that in this world, and I have to live and die here on this little ...?
You don't have to do anyting you don't want to!
Here, my dear, for you!
They are made of a New
Zealand stone called tangiway.
And green is your colour, I can see.
And for you, son!
The maoris of New Zealand -
- use a knife like this.
For cutting up human flesh.
Captain O'Hara, they are beautiful!
I've gotta be going, there's trouble on deck.
Finish your breakfast.
Answer, what's going on here?
Sneaked aboard, eh?
A stow-away! Who are ye?
Who are ye?
What difference does it make?
Toss him overboard!
Let me go!
My name is Timothy Haslam.
You wouldn't be hiding from the police?
It was a fair fight.
And it's plain you killed the other fella.
I won't lie to you,
I did kill him.
But I didn't lift a hand at him until he came at me with a knife.
I believe you.
It is well and fairly spoken.
And I'll help you.
Besides, I'm a man short in me crew.
Take him below.
Hide him in the fox hole.
Come along.
The English law can't reach you in New Zealand.
- Now look.
Just look at her!
I know what I'm gonna do.
I have made up my mind.
- What?
- I gonna be a sailor on a clipper ship, like that one.
- No, not on a clipper ship. Your going into the navy.
- The navy?
- To be an officer and a gentleman!
- Well, that takes money.
- Well, suppose somebody found a way -
- to provide the money and the influence?
- Well, that's just talk, who?
- My father.
- What?
And you suppose my father would permit that?
- I repeat, Marianne.
How could you go aboard a strange ship with that uncouth ragamuffin?
How could you indulge in such a disreputable escapade?
Stop sulking!
- Are those your new glasses?
- Certainly, certainly.
- Well, then you better send them back. I'm not sulking.
I'm smiling humbly.
I am sorry, I aplogize and my behaviour was most unladylike.
I ask you to forgive me.
- Well, we'll say no more about it.
- Thank you, Papa.
- The matter is closed.
- Not quite.
What about William?
- William?
- He wants to go in the navy.
- Not my problem.
- Well, you object to William being around and -
- if he went off to the navy, he wouldn't be here.
Would he?
And when he does come back -
- why, then he'd be a gentleman.
And he wouldn't be so offensive.
Would he?
- Bright girl, Sophie.
- But of course, it takes money and influence.
- Not my money, oh no!
- Mama is very fond of William.
Wouldn't you like to treat William as if he were the son -
- that Mama has always longed for, but has never had?
Mind you, it's not going to be as easy as you think.
William's father is very proud.
You may have a little difficulty in getting him to accept the proposition.
But you're so brilliant, you'll do it!
And mention Mama and her affection for William.
- I don't need to be told how to carry out a good idea!
- Then don't go to see doctor Ozanne this evening.
Tomorrow will do.
- I should go tonight!
I should go now!
And take doctor Ozanne a bottle of brandy.
- I will not!
- Our best brandy. The kind you smuggle in from France.
Marianne, your father is very good.
He's very easily managed.
Mama.
Emily, put the keys of the wine cellar back in my desk.
Very well, Sir.
William, you're practically in the navy.
It's Midsummer Festival day.
How slowly the years have passed -
- since William left for England and -
- the Royal Naval College of Portsmouth.
And now at last Her Majesty's ship arrive -
- sailing majestically into our harbour -
- and William is aboard.
There he is!
Two years without a letter to his own father!
The young cub!
Hey, hey!
Well, old fellow, you look younger than I do!
Digestive trouble!
I may even have to take some of that horrible stuff I give to my patients!
Come in!
Come in, my boy, come in!
This note came for you a while back.
One of the servants brought it from the Patourel house.
"Dear William."
"I have arranged for you to come to dinner tonight at 7."
"So that my father -
- may see the results so far of his investment in your future."
"I know you won't fail me.
Marianne."
Hey, you've gotta go, too!
I wanna go.
I wanna see...
But my ship sails at high tide tonight.
I know, but we'll have the whole afternoon together.
What's a few more years?
Time passes.
Soon you'll be home to stay!
How do you know about my ship?
The Patourel girl told me.
Came over here not ten minutes after the Orion had dropped anchor.
Which Patourel girl?
Both of them.
Both of the pretty little rascals!
They've been popping in and out of ever here since you left.
Bless their hearts.
Which one is it you're so anxious to see?
The one I've had on my mind ever since -
- ever since I first saw her.
That would be the one who is so much like her mother when she was a girl.
Son, if you have it in your heart to speak to this girl -
- remember that fine families are very particular - about a son-in-law.
I know, I've been worrying about it.
About her father.
When you are an established officer -
- in her Majesty's Navy -
- you'll be a gentleman!
Even to Mr Patourel!
- Good evening, Sir.
- Good evening.
- In the drawing room, Sir.
- Thank you.
- William!
- Marguerite!
- The others will be down in a moment.
- And I shall make use of that moment.
Marguerite.
Ever since I saw you last -
- I've thougt of nothing but you.
I love you.
May I say that?
I love you!
- Keep saying it William because I love you too.
- Listen.
This must be our secret.
But all the time I'm away from you -
- you must keep saying to yourself that I love you!
- Mama!
- Good evening, William.
It's a pleasure to welcome you to our home.
You're very handsome in your uniform.
Thank you, Mrs Patourel.
He's a little thin.
- That's the life of disciplin.
The best thing in the world for a man.
William.
How are you, Marianne?
Very well pleased with you.
So you're off to China tonight?
Oh, how lucky you are, William!
You know, Mama, The Green Dolphin trades on the China coast.
And captain O'Hara says that knowledge of the Orient is most important nowadays.
Yes, I suppose so.
In the future, the commerce of the world will center on the Pacific.
Yes, I think Papa will be satisfied with your progress so far.
Excuse me.
What is it, Mrs Metiver?
Doctor Ozanne, he's just had a seizure.
He's very ill!
Mr William must come!
Yes, I'll bring him.
Get my cloak.
William.
Your father just had a sudden attack.
My father?
Margurerite, get Mama's smelling salt.
And then find a doctor. The nearest.
Come William.
Steady William, this might not be serious.
Speak to him, William.
Father?
Can you hear me?
Are you really here, William?
Of course I'm here, of course I'm here!
Thank you, thank you for coming, William.
Shows you -
- you really love me.
You won't have to stay very long.
Because I'm not going to last very long.
- William!
- Yes father?
Wouldn't it be a joke now -
- if I didn't die after all?
But I won't play that kind of joke on you.
Because I've always loved you.
Father! Father!
Oh, come William!
- William, William, listen to me!
- You don't know how wonderful he was!
- Yes, I do. I knew and I loved him.
But you must realize tonight he saw you were being wonderful too.
He saw you as you are now, an officer and a gentleman.
- And that's how you should remember him!
- What does that matter now?
It matters a great deal. Cause you are going to do things that will make him very proud of you.
Oh, William.
Stay here with him for a little while.
I'll stay with you if you like.
But then we must get you back to your ship cause it sails at midnight.
I'm not going to the ship!
I won't leave. I can't!
Yes you can!
You're going to sail away with your ship.
And when you come back next year you come back with your head high!
Full of pride of what you've done with yourself!
With the knowledge that he would've been as proud of you.
You'll find his grave. We'll bury him with honour and with kindness.
But when you kneel by his grave -
- you can weep upon a brave heart and respect yourself as well as him!
William, there will be flowers on his grave next year.
There will always be flowers on his grave.
"Pier 3"
"Sailing tonight: HMS Orion"
Well, Ozanne, there's China.
- Take it all in.
- Yes, Sir.
But be back on board by midnight!
-  By all means, Sir.
All I'm looking forward to is our return home.
- You wish to buy something?
- Yes. Please, I'd like something for a young lady.
- Certainly.
- You speak English, perfectly!
- Yes, my father was an Englishman.
This is a Chinese charm necklace.
To be given to the one whom you love.
- Ah, yes, that's just what I wanted!
How much is it?
- Four pieces of silver.
Chinese money.
- I haven't any Chinese money.
Will you take English?
- One English gold sovereign.
- Could I write a letter?
- Of course, over there.
"Dear Marguerite."
"This necklace will say I have always loved you."
"Wait for me!"
"When I come home I -
- will ask your father for your hand in marriage."
- And when will you be home?
- Not for another two years.
- There is an English clipper ship in the harbour.
It will be home in six months.
- Thank you very much!
You there?
- Ay ay, Sir?
- There's a clipper ship in the port sailing for home.
Put this package and letter on board.
Ay ay, Sir!
- I think this should cover the cost.
- Right, Sir.
- You will drink a little rice wine?
- Where is this place?
Where is this place?
- What's the matter, mate?
- Where's the Orion?
The Orion, man, where is she?
- The Orion, mate, she sailed at midnight!
As far as you're concerned she's halfway to Calcutta!
- Ahoy, a stow-away!
What the devil are ye?
- Don't you remember me, captain O'Hara?
Of St. Pierre?
- Let's have a look at you!
That young fellow!
What are you doing here, son?
What's the trouble?
- I had shore leave.
Something happened.
My ship sailed.
- Women and rum?
- Yes, Sir.
- What ship?
- The Orion.
- The navy?
Young fool!
Alright, lad.
If you had gone straight to
Her Majesty's consul -
- and made a clean brest of it.
But, no.
Instead of that you are now a deserter.
A fine mess you've made of your life!
- Where are we bound, captain O'Hara?
- New Zealand.
And you're lucky!
There you'll be safe from the law.
Fine young muscles like yours will be at a premium among the settlers!
- William!
Parson and Mrs Kelly.
William Ozanne.
- How do you do?
- Well son, I'm ready to up anchor and leave Wellington.
Which means you are through with the Green Dolphin.
But parson Kelly and his wife will take you in.
You can help in the mission school.
- I don't like to impose on a parson.
- Who else am I to impose you on for the parson?
A parson can't refuse you bed and breakfast, it is expressly provided in the Book of Matthew.
Isn't that so parson?
- Quite so!
- Thank you parson!
Mam!
Give a good heart, son!
Don't fret over past mistakes.
And remember, it is better to keep away from the liquor today -
- than to waste tomorrow counting yesterday's empty bottles!
- Thank you for everything, captain O'Hara!
If you ever get back to St Pierre -
- you won't tell anybody?
- Have no fear of that, son, and God bless you!
Shove off lads!
- Earthquake?
- That's right, chum, there's an earthquake.
- That's right!
- Whiskey!
- You're a homie!
- Huh?
- New to this country?
- Oh, just landed, Sir.
- Got a job?
- Yes, I've got a job.
Teaching the kiddies at the mission school.
- Not your sort of work, huh?
- What do you think?
- Got a place up north in the backblocks, getting out Caule.
That is big tree timber.
You can pitch in and join me, if you like.
- But why, you don't know anything about me?
- I know as much about you as your father know about me back in St Pierre.
When he patched up this arm without telling the police.
- I remember, I thought you looked familiar!
You killed a man and got away!
- Keep your mouth shut!
- And your name's Haslam!
- My name's Tai Haruru.
The Maoris gave it to me.
That's all you need to know about me.
- And the same applies to me!
- Alright.
I'll work you harder than you've ever been worked before in your life.
And you'll have to be ready for travel because there'll be war between the natives, the Maoris, and the colonials before long.
Make up your mind, if you go with me you can forget that girl at home.
- Who told you about a girl?
- A mutual friend.
Captain O'Hara.
Tell me something, Ozanne.
Which of the two sisters was it?
- None of your blasted business!
Sir.
- Well, there it is, Ozanne!
- The whole valley?
- Oh, we live...
- You see the lake?
- Aha.
- We live on the banks of the river -
- 10 miles upstream from there.
Without the benefit of clergy or doctors.
- Very comforting. 
- The whole valley is a
Maori stronghold.
You'll find our settlement reasonably comfortable and safe.
- Are those friendly Maoris?
- Well, they're my friends.
Perhaps they'll be yours if you treat them courteously and keep your word.
Never show fear before them.
But they're a dangerous and strange people.
I've seen some extraordinary exhibitions of their ability to predict the future.
Have a look at their river, Ozanne!
Perhaps some day that water will travel halfway around the world and splash on the beach at St Pierre!
- Marguerite!
I want you to go down to the dressmaker's and match this silk for me.
Marguerite, I...
What are you hiding from me, Marguerite?
- It's a secret, Mama.
- Is it a secret that has anything to do with you not marrying anyone of those halfdozen young men?
My dear, I would never insist upon you marrying anyone.
But you have your life to live.
I have a life, mama, -
- in my thoughts and my dreams.
- Marguerite!
- Marianne! Home, Edward.
- Papa?
I believe William Ozanne is dead.
- No, I question that.
Only the good die young!
No, he's dead!
Or that would account for his not writing once since he sailed away on the Orion.
- Oh, I don't know...
Well, if he were alive - 
- nothing would have kept him -
-  writing to... you in common gratitude.
- Oh, true...
- Or to me in friendship.
Or to Marguerite.
Of whom he was once very fond.
In a childish way.
No, papa.
William is dead.
- Sophie, come quick, she's fainted!
- What?
- She's fainted!
- Mrs Metivier, Marguerite's fainted.
Get my smelling salt, cold water and towels.
- And the dusters.
- Marianne's fainted?
I don't believe it!
- Neither do I.
But your father hasn't lied to me for 30 years.
Let's go and see.
- I have asked your mother to come down.
- Marianne, what is it?
- Get her some cognac.
- No, no, no, some smelling salts!
- No, cognac would be better, dear.
[moans]
- But who!
- The lady is late.
I was waiting here for Mr Patourel when the two of them came in.
And all I said was:
"Here's a letter for you, Mr Patourel, which
I bring you from William Ozanne in New Zealand".
And then...
Now look, this one's fainted!
- No, this one hasn't fainted.
This one's praying.
- Then I'll be going.
- But tell me about William, what is he doing in New Zealand?
Is he still in the navy?
- Due to an unfortunate incident, the lad severed his connection.
And good day to ye all!
- Marianne, the letter is addressed to me!
- Suppose I read it aloud, dear?
- I will not be bullied in my own household!
"Dear Sir"
"It is a long time since I've had the pleasure of addressing you."
"Much has happened and I now feel that
I have earned the privilege of writing."
- The young blaggard! 
Left the navy, and a deserter probably!
After all the money I spent on him!
- Mama, go on with the letter!
"I have been in the lumber business for over two years."
"And I can say I am becoming a fairly successful businessman."
"My partner is a man of great ability."
"And we have developed our little settlement into a garden spot with comfortable dwellings."
- What's been going on out there?
Has that fortune telling medicine man been reading tea leaves again?
- He says that a letter you wrote was delievered today on the other side of the world.
- How could he know that?
I personally gave it to captain -
- O'Hara myself months ago,
I didn't even...
Hold on, wait a minute!
- It was about a young woman, wasn't it?
That's my own private affair!
- Put down that drink!
The Patourel girl?
Alright!
I was drunk!
I was in Wellington.
Alone and miserable!
Alright, I was drunk!
Never had the courage if I hadn't been drunk.
Asking a wonderful girl like that to come all the way out here.
- Which girl?
- After all they did for me.
I wrote and offered my hand in marriage.
A life like this!
- Which girl, I said?
- Marguerite of course!
- "I do not know what life has brought you and your good wife."
"And as for your lovely daughters they may have married."
"Yet I can not but hope that..."
- Speak up, what does the young blaggard want?
"Yet I cannot but hope that your daughter Marianne is still unmarried."
"Yet I cannot but hope that your daughter Marianne is still unmarried."
"That you would consider permitting her to live -
- in such a rough but glorious country as my wife."
- As his wife?
Marianne?
- The confounded cheat!
The outrageous, overwhelming fool!
Sophie, here, write, my dictation!
Here's pen, ink, paper, sit down, dear!
Now write, Mr William Ozanne.
- Father, you act as though I've been insulted -
-  instead of honoured by a marriage proposal!
- No daughter of mine...
- I am old enought to marry without your consent -
- and that is exactly what I intend do!
- Of course you are!
You are unjust to William!
If he was foolish in the past -
- he has now written you a fine and straight forward letter.
- My daughter going to live among a lot of man eating savages?
- She always wanted to marry William.
She will never marry anybody else.
Will you, Marianne?
- No!
And I am going to marry William!
- Everyone is insane here except me!
Here, write a letter to mister William Ozanne.
"Sir, you may return here."
"And if at that time Marianne still desires to marry you."
I will permit the bands to be published.
"And in due course -
- and in the presence of her family, and in her own church..."
- I don't intend to wait for any letter!
When does the Green Dolphin sail?
- On the 31.
- And I forbid you...
- Then I'm going on the 31!
- I forbid it!
Log of the Green Dolphin.
Sunday. 172nd Day out of St Pierre.
Weather fine.
Lord hear our prayer.
Eternal Lord which alone spreadeth out the heavens -
- and ruleth the raging of the sea.
Receive into thy Almighty protection.
The persons of us.
Thy servants.
And the ship in which we serve.
Amen.
Look alive you buckeyed nincompoop!
Is it land or is it a cloud?
Land ho!
Land at starboard!
Mr Johnsson!
Anchor it with four topsails and yip
Ay ay Sir!
Start the rollers and get up.
Come on you sons of a seacook and get up there!
Now hear me closely!
William Ozanne has no reason to expect you on this ship.
When we tie up at Wellington -
- you can shut yourself up in your cabin.
And three days later we'll be on our way again.
You don't want me to marry William Ozanne?
The letter I gave your father was handed to me -
- by a bleary-eyed William Ozanne.
Just out of a stinking saloon.
Surely it was written more in whiskey than in ink!
Had I known it was a proposal of marriage to ye -
-  I'd have torn it to bits and flung it to the seven winds!
So help me I would!
If William were a fine strong character -
- what would he need me for?
For the very reason that he sent for me -
- is because he knows I can save him from himself.
Captain O'Hara, I've loved you since the first day I came aboard the Green Dolphin.
But there isn't anything you can say to change me.
I'll make a fine man of William.
I will.
I will.
Drink up lads!
The Green Dolphin's pulling in if you wants to meet her.
That proves no second sight.
The natives could have just sighted the ship -
- rounding The Three Kings and sent word over.
Now, if she brings a letter from Marguerite...
That's different.
Come on, let's see.
Look.
Look there.
It can't be.
She came!
It's Marguerite!
Look again.
Marianne?
You stupid fool!
Did you put the wrong name in that drunken letter?
But even if I did -
- why should Marianne come?
Did Marianne ever show any signs of being in love with you?
I think -
- perhaps she did.
Go on.
Wave to her
Keep waving.
Wave your arm off.
I can't marry her. I'm not in love with her!
Are you gonna send a girl like that back home -
- turned down by a drunken young jackass too tipsy to remember the right name of the girl he loved?
No, you won't do that.
I might do it in the name of truth and common sense.
But you haven't got either the strength or the cruelty.
Now listen!
Go to her, put your arms around her.
Make her feel that you want her.
And don't ever let down.
And remember, her name is Marianne.
I hate what I'm gonna do, but I do it!
I'll marry her, just as my father married.
Out of pity.
And don't worry, I'll go through with it.
Good luck, Mam.
Congratulations, Sir.
Mister Morgan!
All hands -
- spice the main braize.
And a double eggnog to all of ye!
Thank you, captain O'Hara.
Thank you for my beautiful wedding.
Now with certain documents to be signed -
- and since we set sail with the sunrise tide -
- would you mind lending me your new husband for a thrice?
Take him captain, with all my worldly goods I hold him in debt.
I seem to recall the best man didn't kiss the bride!
You don't like me, do you?
Please, Mrs Ozanne.
It's not that, I'm ...
I'm anxious about you.
Anxious?
I've been very close to your -
- husband for several years now.
He has changed since you knew him.
Mr Haslam, I'm quite capable of handling my own family.
I merely suggest for both your sakes that -
- you be patient with him.
Oh, I'll be patient.
I have no idea that my husband loves me to distraction.
Actually, he's never known what real love is.
And I did not travel halfway -
- around the world expecting any miracle to have improved him.
Belive me, I ...
... I only want to help you.
You can, now.
Is there any reason why we can not leave for the settlement at once instead of tomorrow?
You see, I refuse to spend my wedding night anywhere except in the home my husband has provided for me.
Oh, put it in there!
And as for father, poor darling, he's as blind as a bat.
Here, in the cupboard.
But of course, that has been coming on for so long.
By now he hardly knows whether he can see anything or not.
And Marguerite, is she well?
A good deal has changed from the young girl you remember.
And like so many beautiful women -
- she's become spiritually lazy.
She hasn't married?
Well, she has had many offer.
But I don't believe she has been able to summon the necessary emotion.
Hine-Moa, in the bedroom please.
Mr Haslam?
Who's idea was it shipping your timber over land on those wagons?
It's the only way to ship timber.
Don't you know that it is always cheaper to transport bulky goods by water?
Excuse me.
Now look here, Marianne. Tai knows the timber business.
And I know the shipping business.
- Sit down, Mr Haslam.
- Thank you.
Oh, that will be all, Hine-Moa, thank you.
You should build barges. Large ones.
Float your timber to the sea down that river. From there you can ship it to any place in the world.
Yes, I think that is quite possible.
Well, it will cut your delievery costs by two thirds.
I believe they would.
Now, Mrs Ozanne, I'm sure that you will excuse me.
Yes of course, Mr Haslam.
This is my wedding night.
Miss Marguerite.
This one's in Mr Ozanne's handwriting.
It must be important.
Mrs Metivier, I want you.
My daughter.
Marguerite.
I have something to say.
Mostly Octavius for you.
I want Marguerite to hear it too.
Don't talk, Sophie dear!
When I married you, Octavius -
- I did not love you.
The marriage was forced on me by my parents.
Against my will.
Mama!
I was in love with another man.
I came to you Octavius with a broken heart.
Hating you.
But from the very beginning you were kind to me.
Thoughtful, generous.
And so I began to realize -
- that your love was bigger than anything I had ever felt.
I was humble.
And frightened in its presence.
But still I did not love you.
Dear, my dear!
There's no need to talk, no need to tell.
And as the years went on -
- something began to grow in my heart.
At first respect.
Then gratitude.
And the dashing young prince I once loved -
- faded from my dreams.
And suddenly -
- before my eyes -
- you Octavius.
Feeble sized without much hair.
No longer young.
But more splendid -
- than any dream lover a girl have ever had.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Do you, Marguerite?
Yes, yes I'm trying to.
I've come to love your father.
With a love so deep.
So great.
- that nothing on Earth can compare.
Mama!
I know what you mean.
Apply it to your own life.
To your own lost love, my dear child!
And now, Octavius.
My dear one, I've always known, all about it.
Octavius!
Yes, even before I married you!
My eyes were quite good then.
Remember?
So it was impossible for me to mistake the way you looked when his name was mentioned.
Yes, Marguerite.
I've always known your mother's beautiful and honourable secret.
That's why I always did what I could for William.
William?
Then ...
I was in love with William's father.
And you?
You knew always?
If I had thought that Edmond
Ozanne would make you happy -
- I would never have married you.
But I did not believe in his love.
But I did believe in mine!
I believed I'd be a better husband. A better father.
Octavius!
You are wonderful!
Sophie.
I knew!
Even though -
- you never told me before.
Just when.
You began to love me.
Oh, Sophie!
Sophie, Sophie!
I'm so proud!
And happy!
That you did tell me!
At last.
Leave me alone with her, dear.
Leave us together.
Marguerite.
Please, little one!
Come on, read your letter, maybe it will help.
Read it to me, please?
"My dear sister-in-law."
"I hasten to write you -
- that Marianne will go to Wellington soon -
- where she will have the best of care -
- for the arrival of our child."
"Hoping this finds you" ...
My daughter.
May I go to my father now?
Your father does not need you now.
Quietly -
- he has joined your mother.
God rest his soul.
Reverend Mother, Reverend Mother!
Somebody's knocking on the old door.
It must be Saint Peter!
Saint Peter?
Saint Peter! Come, you can hear him yourself!
I hear nothing?
But I heard Saint Peter knocking! 
Plese, may I unlock the door?
It is unlocked.
I unlocked it myself 40 years ago.
Open it yourself, if you wish.
Pick her up.
Bring her to my room.
Thank you, Reverend Mother, thank you!
My poor dear child.
Help me, help me, I'm all alone now.
I'll try my child.
There's no one to turn to.
I'm completely lost!
I can't think.
It's my mind.
I can't think. I can't think.
Others have passed through the same dark way.
There's no way for me to live.
You'll find a way.
Child.
Your tragedy is not unique in human history.
I needed my father and my mother because -
- because the man I loved turned away from me.
And now, because your parents are gone -
- because your earthly lover has failed you -
- you imagine that God has also withdrawn His presence?
Yes!
The way the in which the human race perpetuate its scorn of Our The Mighty God -
- is quite deplorable.
Come!
Let's see if you can stand up.
Yes, I can stand, I can walk, I can run.
And if I could fly it wouldn't help.
Let us see if you can pray!
Thank you, Reverend Mother.
Oh, Marguerite?
Marguerite?
I have a little book here.
I read it myself when I was about your age.
Read it!
Then - we may talk again!
That's a nice job of loading, William!
Cleverly planned.
Yeah, my wife's idea.
This was hers idea, not yours I suppose, the two of you sat up all night arguing about it?
Tai, I promised you I'd stick to my bargain but I didn't agree to like it.
Yes, Mr Haslam, you've come to apologize for William again?
No.
I've brought you a gift.
Thank you, Mr Haslam!
Thank you!
Why do you dislike me so much?
Cause you have too much influence with William!
I've only been able to influence
William on only one thing.
Not to give up when he takes on a job.
Alright, I failed in my marriage.
And you think I'm making you the scapegoat for my failure?
Your marriage is not a failure!
My husband hates me!
If I told you that hatred -
- was only the reverse side of love -
- you'd ridicule me as usual.
It's not true.
You can no more separate love from hatred -
- than you can separate the two sides  of a coin.
To possess one is to possess the other.
But I don't want scientific explanations.
What do you want?
What do I want?
I love my husband to the point of agony.
Yet there's no brightness, no warmth in our lives.
What do I want?
Tell me, Mr Haslam.
Have I been completly wrong in my handling of William?
Or isn't it true that he is infinitely a finer and better person?
That's very true, he has improved!
But you think he would be happier if -
- I was more submissive and helpless.
It would be a strange way to wane a husband away from his weaknesses.
- by developing weaknesses of my own.
Marianne? Marianne?
William?
About last night ...
I'm sorry, Marianne!
William, have I been a bad influence on you?
No man could have a better wife!
Perhaps ...
Perhaps the boy will help you when he comes?
You sure it's gonna be a boy?
I believe you'd rather have a girl?
It's going to be a boy, I know it!
William.
Please let Mr Haslam take the barges this time.
Stay here with me.
Cutting the timber is Tai's job.
Taking it to market is mine.
You know The Green Dolphin be waiting at the sea coast for this timber.
Captain O'Hara is expecting me. I can't let him down!
William, William, what's happened to us?
Even when we're in each other's arms -
- there always seem to be a thousand miles between us!
Look, Marianne.
I've been a clumsy fool and I've made you wretched.
If you forgive me, I promise I'll try to do better.
Yes, yes, William!
Goodbye, Marianne.
Forward!
So we're left alone together.
Not for the first time.
As a rule I see very little of you on these occasions.
Perhaps this time I shall see more?
Mr Haslam, will you please make those natives stop singing?
No, that is the chant of the earthquake God.
The native's believe there is to be an earthquake.
But William does not believe it.
And I imagine you don't belive it?
But when your house starts shaking -
- stand in the nearest doorway.
And yell for me!
The men have stopped working.
Go and see what's happened.
We should see the coast around the next bend.
Big sea!
Yeah.
Watch out! Watch out!
My son!
I shall lose my son!
You'll have your son.
No, it's too soon!
Tai, get a doctor!
This isn't a country where a doctor lives on the next street.
My son!
- I thought I'd at least ...
- Marianne, listen to me!
You'll have your child, I know what's to be done.
What?
Oh no, no!
You've got to trust me!
Remember this is the sort of thing that happens to women who chose to live in the backblocks.
And remember you chose it.
Oh, I trust you!
I will try to give -
- to give as little trouble as possible.
First news from the backblocks.
Horrible disaster.
The Green Dolphin is missing.
Here you are, first news from the backblocks.
Horrible disaster,
The Green Dolphin is missing.
For three weeks only meager details.
The worst catastrophe in New Zealand history.
Exquisite!
Now you look a bit more like your old self!
This is no time for compliments, Mr Haslam!
Tell me, is there any definite news of William?
Yes, this time there is definite news.
Your husband is alive, he's quite safe.
The barges were wrecked in the tidal wave but he was able to make his way into Wellington.
You're not lying?
You swear you are telling the truth -
- William is alright?
I'd give you my word, now be calm!
But I am calm!
I have complete control of myself.
My mental and physical condition is remarkable, Mr Haslam.
It's no good, Marianne.
In this situation we can't go back to where we were!
Why not be friends?
I'm not aware we're not friends!
William!
Marianne, what a terrible time you've had!
- But William, there...
- There were so many days -
- before I knew that anyone here was alive!
I'm in such a filthy state.
I should have washed and changed.
- But I...
- But you were so anxious to see your child.
Well William, there she is!
She?
She! Is it a girl?
Yes, I'm afraid it is.
Why wasn't I told? A girl!
I had no idea your daughter would mean so much to you!
You can tell she's gonna be fair haired!
Look at those eyes!
Yes, I've named her Marguerite Veronica.
But we'll call her Veronica?
Time baby's bath!
You may take her, Hine-Moa.
What's wrong, William?
Marianne.
Captain O'Hara is dead.
Dead?
Drowned.
And the Green Dolphin?
That's gone too.
Tell me!
The Green Dolphin was wrecked by the tidal wave.
I... I swam out with a rope.
How dared you, you might have been drowned!
You should have thought of your wife and your child!
Captain O'Hara insisted on being the last ashore.
He stood on the quarter deck bellowing orders.
Then suddenly before you could say "Jack Robinson".
The Green Dolphin heeled over -
- and was gone.
And him with it.
I swam out again.
I couldn't save him.
But I think he knows I tried!
And you have paid your debt to him.
I'm proud of you William!
Captain O'Hara!
Green Dolphin.
The last tie with -
- home gone.
Everything else is gone too, Marianne.
Years of hard work destroyed in a single day.
We begin again.
We begin again, William.
And we'll do better!
We certainly will!
The several passing years see New Zealand -
- swept by the fierce tides of a raw new world -
- raging in violent ebb and flow.
"MAORI WAR BREAKS OUT AGAIN"
"NATIVES BURN VILLAGE NEAR AUCKLAND"
"TROOPS TO DEFEND WELLINGTON"
"Mr Haslam."
"A native friend of yours sends secret warning" -
- "to expect hostilities in your neighborhood at any moment."
William?
Tell me, do you think this is reassuring enough?
"My dear Marguerite, do not worry about the Maori war."
"True, it still goes on up... north."
"Because the natives who want to sell their land to the white settlers" -
- "are now killing Maoris who don't want to sell."
"But the new governor expect to work out a treaty of peace" - 
- "which is probably accomplished by now".
Aren't you a bit too optimistic, even for Marguerite?
Peace can be arranged!
I could do it if I were the governor.
You probably could!
Hello there!
Uncle Tai!
Uncle Tai!
Well, you didn't come in to see me today!
I've got some news for you.
Let's go inside.
Heavy fighting has broken out again.
Marianne and Veronica must leave for Wellington at once.
Why?
But the peace terms?
The governor has blundered badly.
We have men and guns, we will fight!
You must take Veronica to Wellington!
We'll build a stockade around the house.
And turn this place into a fort?
- Certainly!
- That would -
- be the worst possible mistake.
To show our friendly Maoris we don't trust them.
You argue with your wife.
She never would listen to me.
You must take Veronica to Wellington, don't you see that?
I see nothing of the sort!
Veronica and I stay here!
Stop and think, Tai, you realize that I'm right!
Veronica and I are far more likely to be murdered on a long journey to Wellington!
And if we stay here we'll be well protected.
There's something about that, Tai!
As always I bow to your clever reasoning.
May I do anything for you in Wellington?
Are you going to Wellington?
Yes, I am.
William, may I see you outside for a moment, please?
Marianne, please!
What is all this?
Are you trying to get rid of me?
- Good night, daddy!
- Good night, sweetheart!
- Good night, mama!
- Good night, dear!
Good night, Hine-Moa!
Well, pray for the best.
Tai's gone and without him we'd never dare make the trip to Wellington.
Then get out every man you have and start building that stockade!
Come Veronica, your dinner.
Come here.
Veronica! Veronica dear! 
Come, you must wake up.
No, no, there...
Marianne!
Can you forgive me, William?
It was all my fault.
I wouldn't go to Wellington.
I made you build that stupid stockade.
No, you didn't make me. You honestly convinced me.
So don't blame yourself only.
We're both guilty.
I'm afraid, daddy!
Shhh!
Well thank heavens you're alright!
- How did you get through? 
- Be quite and listen!
When I went to Wellington for help -
- I expected this invasion from the northern tribes.
But our own Maoris turned on us!
And for good reason. Now that's our chance.
Our own Maoris are out there among the others.
And they're still my friends. They were strong enough to get me in here.
Oh William, then everthing ...
Whether they have the influence to get us out I don't know.
They're in council now, that's why it's so quiet.
But what if they won't?
It's a chance we'll have to take!
Chance? But Veronica!
179 pounds 11 shillings 3d.
That's a good account.
Well, how do we stand financially?
I should say we have enough capital in the bank to start ourselves another future.
No, we can forget that one.
You know, I've been thinking about our future.
The Maori wars are getting worse.
I think it would be best if -
- well, if we were to leave here and go south.
South Island?
I've been thinking I said, I haven't decided!
Let's talk it over.
John Martin...
What are the timber prospects on South Island?
Bad!
But there's a great future for sheep farming.
Sheep?
What exactly have you got in mind, Marianne?
To sell our land and take a ship to the
South Island. Find some good pasture land.
Spend our capital on it, hire expert labour.
Soon there be nothing about sheep we won't know.
Why sheep? I know timber, I love it.
Why can't we stick to timber?
Because there's a bigger future in wool!
How do you know that?
Because I've an instinct for these things.
An instinct for making money.
Personally I can never think of sheep -
- without connecting them with Job in the Bible.
One time Job lost all his sheep; had boils.
That was just one bad year.
How much of this is your business instinct and how much is the safety of Veronica?
It's mostly for the child's sake.
Ever since the Maori trouble she's been having dreadful nightmares.
You know that, William.
She has a morbid curiosity now about fighting and soldiers.
I want to take her where there is no fighting.
Yes Tai, it's uncanny the way you always bring a hammer down on the nail.
It's really for Veronica's sake!
Well?
Well William?
If it is for Veronica's good that we should go south -
- we go south!
Here's to the flocks and herds of Job.
And no boils!
We'll go as soon as possible.
There's a great suffering among my
Maori friends caused by the Colonials.
They need help.
I'm going back to them with medical supplies.
Tai, we can not wait indefinitely ...
I will not prevent you from leaving whenever you like!
And all my best wishes will go with you.
But you are our partner!
Surely you'll come with us?
You don't know me very well, Marianne.
I find very little value in life -
- beside from my personal independence.
That you and William should join me in my lumber business -
- that was one thing.
That I should follow along at the tail end of your -
- biblical migration like a tamed tabby cat -
- that is another.
There you are, darling!
Say goodby to uncle Tai, Veronica.
I'll go aboard and see about the luggage.
Oh, and Marianne, try not to fight with
Tai your last five minutes together!
I'll try!
Come, sweetheart.
Are you really hurt that I'm not coming with you?
Yes, I am.
I thought you had a real affection for William and Veronica!
I have.
And for you.
Then why not come with us?
The reason I gave.
You spoke of trailing after us.
You'd be what you've always been, a central figure in the picture.
I thought Marianne Ozanne must always be there.
No, I... I know myself better than I used to.
I'm sure.
I really don't how I should manage without you.
I doubt it.
Don't talking of losing your independence.
A man in love has no independence worth mentioning.
Yes, Marianne, I love you.
I have for years.
You certainly didn't love me when I first came out here.
Long before that.
At home on the island.
When you were a little girl in your teens.
I used to worship you from a distance.
On the island?
William never told me you came from St Pierre!
That's no coincidence.
Captain O'Hara brought us to the same place -
- for similar reasons.
I can never go home there.
I began by loving you as a child.
I love your faults as well as your virtues.
Have I still so many faults?
At least I'm not proud now, am I?
No, you're not.
I love you for that too because -
- I think I had something to do with it.
Yes, you did.
A great deal.
Everything.
And that's why you love me.
Oh, you hated me too!
Remember what I said that you could no more separate love from hatred than separate the two sides of a coin?
Well, you hated me because I saw too much of your real self.
Then I found when you were with me -
- everything was alright.
You learned humility from me.
And you love me, don't you?
Tai, I love William with every fibre of my being.
But I love you too.
For the qualities you have that
I've tried to develop in him.
Yes, Tai, I love you.
But I belong to William.
You still believe that?
It's true!
William's love is all I ever wanted.
That's why I'm not going with you.
You'll have more chance of getting what you want if -
- he has no one to turn to but you.
But I have his love.
Don't be too sure.
This newfound humility of yours only goes skin deep.
You have made progress, but -
- your battle isn't won yet.
Goodbye, Marianne.
I won't forget you.
Ever.
If I believed in souls -
- I'd say that yours and mine are very long aquaintances.
Veronica is in the cabin.
Goodbye, William.
You're glad to get rid of a couple of trouble makers, eh?
I'd not have missed these years for anything!
Not always happy.
All those rousing arguments. 
I wonder how you stood it?
Well, the adjustments interested me.
You've made a good job with Marianne.
Most people including Marianne would say she'd made a good job out of me.
Only a fool could have made that blunder that you did.
But only a very fine man could have saved her from disaster.
Disaster, Marianne?
If you hadn't turned your life into a magnificent lie -
- she'd have certainly floundered.
And if you hadn't made that idiotic mistake in a girl's name I'd never known her.
Ready Mr Ozanne?
We're about to cast off, Sir.
Well.
Reverend Mother?
What is it, sister Angelique?
A lady to see you, Reverend Mother.
She sends you this little book.
Sit down, Marguerite.
It's a long time.
You've read it?
Over and over!
To see if there is some way for me to live.
I seem to have given up all my girlhood friends.
I've dropped out of all life.
I belong to nothing or nobody.
And yet -
- you do not look so very unhappy?
I'm not unhappy!
I'm only... lost.
But I want to feel once again -
- that I'm following some pattern of life.
Sometime God permits deep disappointment to enter our lives.
In order to open up our eyes to what He wants us to do.
And so great is His magnanimity -
- that if we come at last to His feet.
- I think he cares little how we came.
Am I good enough, Reverend Mother?
Ask yourself, my daughter.
Keep asking yourself.
- This is the residency of Mrs William Ozanne?
- Yes?
With compliments of Captain Fawcett.
Of Her Majesty's ship Brighton.
What you doing tonight?
What sauce, I wouldn't go out with you!
Besides, we've got a party on!
Thank you, Lucy.
Listen mama, Mr Anderson is making a speech!
Yes dear.
Gentlemen!
Two years ago this group sponsored the organization of a steam ship company.
Ay, look what the shares are quoted at today!
Of course the original idea came from Mr William Ozanne.
You know...
I'm thinking he must have
Scottish antecedence!
Gentlemen!
I give you the health of the most popular man in Dunedin!
Mr William Ozanne.
To William Ozanne!
Thank you, gentlemen!
I think your toast might well be to New Zealand.
Or to the steamship itself, which Mr Anderson so cannily puts -
- has done so much good for all of us.
But certainly instead of me -
- I think your toast should have been given to my wife.
Because in New Zealand or Timbuktu -
- with sheep, wool, steam or with timber -
- any man influenced by such a woman -
- must succeed!
It is to her that I owe whatever small accomplishments I've made.
There, Veronica.
You've heard your father's speech.
Now you must go to bed.
Come along!
How was the party?
Beautiful, weren't you listening?
Yes.
All those things you said about me -
- made me blush!
But they were true!
But you were generous.
Far too generous.
William.
There's something I want to talk to you about.
Let's sell out here and go home!
To our real home, St Pierre!
Back to St Pierre?
Why?
Because of... of Marguerite.
Marguerite?
But, she's going to become a nun!
But she's still a novice.
And we can see her before she takes her final vows.
But why?
Here we have everything!
The finest house in Dunedin.
But William!
This isn't really our home!
There's that beautiful house in
St Pierre, empty, waiting for us.
Then there's the family business that you can now run most efficiently.
But I can't go back.
There's the little matter of desertion from Her Majesty's Navy.
Come here.
There.
It's taken me more than a year to arrange that.
"With due consideration it has been decided -
- that William Ozanne is to be allowed to resign honourably from the Royal Navy. 
And in regard to the charges of desertion it has instead been officially pronounced involuntary absence from duty"
Think what home would mean to Veronica!
The opportunities she can have.
But mostly William, it's Marguerite.
My own sister.
You never knew what it cost me to leave my home.
To come out to this new country to marry you.
I want to go home, William!
I do so want to go home!
May I look now?
No, not yet!
Now?
No, no, no!
Now!
That's where mama was born.
But how will Father Christmas know we moved from New Zealand?
Oh, he has ways of finding out!
Miss Marianne!
For the love of God!
No, no, Miss Metivier, no!
Do you think you could find a dolly at Grandpa's office?
I wouldn't be at all surprised!
Goodbye sweetheart!
Goodbye.
Four sheets -
- twelve pillow slips, embroidered.
Here Veronica!
See you may help mama. 
Take this into your bedroom -
- and put it on the bed, dear.
Four linen sheets.
Oh, there's a tear in this one.
Very well, put it aside.
What about my letter?
The tide was out -
- and the young man is already back.
The young man delievered your letter to the Mother Superior.
And it will reach Miss Marguerite at once.
What is it, dear?
Look mama!
Well, where did you find it?
In this box.
"Dear Marguerite.
This necklace will say I have always loved you.
Wait for me.
When I come home I will ask your father for your hand in marriage.
William."
May I wear it?
May I?
Yes dear.
Look, Mrs Ozanne, I found these two embroidered pillow cases.
I suppose you used these when you were children.
This one will come in very well for Veronica.
After all her name is Marguerite.
Good evening, Mrs Metivier!
Where is Mrs Ozanne?
In her room.
She is not feeling well, Sir.
Too much unpacking in my way of thinking, Sir.
Hello, my dear!
Tired yourself out, did you?
I'm tired too.
Father's business is quite a terrifying institution.
What's the matter, Marianne?
Is it... is it Marguerite?
Have you heard from her?
Yes, I've heard from Marguerite.
Tomorrow she is to become a nun.
It would seem we arrived just in time.
I found this today.
This was written a long time ago, Marianne.
But you loved Marguerite!
You loved her!
But that's all passed now.
But when you wrote my father you lied.
You asked for my hand in marriage.
I didn't lie.
Listen to me, Marianne, I love you.
Listen to more lies?
You never loved me.
You loved her!
But you sent for me, why?
It wasn't a lie.
Why did you send for me?
I'll tell you, Marianne.
Now I must tell you.
I never wanted you to know, never though you'd find out.
But now.
What did you never want me to find out?
That I accidentally wrote your name instead of Marguerite's in the letter to your father.
You accidentally wrote my name?
Now our whole marriage has just been -
- a slip of the pen?
Marianne.
Does Marguerite know of -
- of your slip of the pen?
No, absolutely not!
I never even as much as hinted anything.
Please believe me, Marianne.
I never told a living soul.
Oh, that's not quite true.
I told Tai Haruru, I had to tell him.
Tai Haruru knew?
He knew that you hated me?
I thought I had reached the lowest depths of degradation.
But I didn't expect this!
So Tai knew?
Of course he knew.
And now I understand everything.
Why, you would never have married me if he hadn't forced you into it.
Would you've, William?
Oh William.
William, don't ever ever -
-speak to me again!
Good morning, Mrs Metivier.
Has Mrs Ozanne come downstairs yet?
She left the house an hour ago, Sir.
Miss Marguerite takes her vows to the church today.
Have you forgotten, Sir?
Thank you.
- Oh, Marianne!
- Marguerite!
My dear, even when you were on the other side of the world -
- I always felt you near to me!
Marguerite?
Yesterday I found a letter
William sent you with a necklace.
He intended to ask you to come to New Zealand.
But when he wrote father he put in my name by mistake.
Then when I came instead of you -
- he married me.
Out of pity.
Oh, Marguerite, don't you hear me?
Don't you realise what I'm saying?
I knew you were in love with him.
I knew he had an affection for you.
I made myself believe it was only a childish infatuation.
So I fought you for him.
And I always thought I had won him fairly.
But he's never loved anyone but you.
Was it just an accident that you found the letter?
Just chance, do you think?
Perhaps there is less chance in life than we realise.
Perhaps it was intended to bring out the truth at last.
But when I think of what your life has been.
- Heartbreak.
- Do I look like a heartbroken woman?
But you're becoming a nun because William married me!
At first when you went away to marry him -
- and when your child was born -
- there was nothing left for me but chaos and hopelessness.
Oh, Marguerite!
Marguerite, can you ever forgive me?
There is no question of forgiveness.
Marianne?
Your husband is here in my room
He wants to talk to you.
He loves you.
I'll send him to you.
No!
I ask you to do this for me.
Tell William that I have outgrown the young selfish love of a girl in her teens.
That I found here what I've been searching for all my life.
Tell him this is the way everything was meant to be.
You were destined to accomplish his salvation.
I was destined for this.
I was swept up to thee by thy beauty.
And if I was once unhappy -
- today I am supremely happy!
Not because I have given up something.
But because I have been given everything.
Tell him this.
And then when you hear the chapel bells ringing -
- then bring him to see me.
Marianne, so there is to be no doubt in your mind.
I've come here to see Marguerite.
To tell her that as much as I loved her once -
- my love is now only for my wife.
What kind of love can that be?
Something manufactured out of your sense of duty?
It would be an unhappy world -
- if the only kind of love was the love of you.
Suppose I didn't love you when I married you?
You weren't a very lovable person then!
I didn't want to love you, I didn't try to.
But something great and wonderful was born out of our relationship.
By accomodating ourselves to each other's feelings -
- and learning to know each other's virtues.
This is far more worth having than any other love I can think of.
Marianne, don't you see -
- it was no slip of the pen that brought you to me?
It was something far greater than us!
Something beyond my control.
Why, I do love you, Marianne.
Now that I know how much -
- a whole new life is ahead of us!
Come with me to Marguerite so I can tell the truth.
So that you know that I -
- I only want you!
William!
This love of yours.
This love that grew out of our marriage?
Has it all the warmth and glory?
The passion?
And tenderness?
Everything that you once wanted love to be to you?
More than I ever dreamed of!
And now -
- with absolute truth between us -
- it will be as perfect love as there can be on this Earth.
Oh William!
William, I'm so proud of you.
Go now, my children.
And be investeded in happiness -
- of the congregation of the Sisters of St Peter.
May the blessing of almighty God -
- the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost descend upon you and remain forever.
Amen.
THE END
Fair seat, bad hands, mount not sufficiently schooled.
Disqualified.
Here comes the California cockerel
Ten pesos he clears 'em all.
Cleanly? Taken.
Grow wings, my friend.
Ten pesos, if you please.
Maybe you've forgotten that in California they use horses for cradles.
- Well done, señor. Excellent.
- And all I did was sit on his back.
Three carrots after his oats tonight.
- You go to an affair of the court?
- No, of the heart.
- Something is wrong.
- The face, man. The face...
Why the fine feathers?
A señorita that would put St Anthony on the griddle. We're to meet in...
Have you forgotten that you cross swords with Lieutenant Cortez at three o'clock?
It slipped my mind.
Why do I have to meet every swordsman in Madrid?
Everybody enjoys a certain amount of fighting, but why do they all pick on me?
Calm yourself. It's become a distinction to assail a California cockerel.
You pink them slightly in the arm or shoulder and they boast of having met you.
Cadet Vega, the commandant wishes to see you in his office at once.
Good. I can't possibly fight the fellow now.
Explain that to him, will you?
And tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.
Señores, your attention, please.
I'm buying wine for all.
Come on.
It's your last chance to fill up on me.
Last chance?
What do you mean?
My father has ordered me home.
I sail on the first ship from Lisbon.
To California?
But what about your commission here?
I'll have to give that up.
What's it like in California?
Are the Indians troublesome?
- Then who is there to fight?
- No one.
Then what will you do with this spur of yours, my cockerel?
This...
Leave it there.
And when you see it, think of me, in a land of gentle missions, happy peons, sleepy caballeros, and everlasting boredom.
Wine.
A toast.
To California, where a man can only marry, raise fat children, and watch his vineyards grow.
- Are the vineyards bearing well this season?
- By some miracle the grapes remain sweet.
- Why so gloomy, my friend?
- People can't sing with hatred in their hearts.
- Hatred for whom?
- The alcalde. May his soul burn in hell.
The alcalde?
A kinder, better man never lived.
You don't know him.
I should know him.
He's my father.
I said it, and I won't deny it. I've taken
20 lashes before for a slip of the tongue.
Row, row.
Get me to shore.
- I'm honoured. How can I serve you?
- A glass of your best wine.
- You are a stranger in these parts?
- No, not exactly.
I was born and raised not far from here.
I am the son of the alcalde.
Where can I get a carriage to drive me to Los Angeles?
Well, wake up.
Didn't you hear me?
This way.
Pedro, here is a caballero who would employ you. He is the son of the alcalde.
I want to be driven to Los Angeles.
I have some boxes and a portmanteau.
I'll pay you well.
Stop staring at me.
Will you drive me or not?
What's come over this country?
Have you all gone mad?
Listen, you.
Find speech, or I'll cut out your tongue.
Please. You are too late.
Your good father has already attended to that.
My father?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, but at a meeting of the peons, this man spoke against the heavy taxes.
The next day, the soldiers of His Excellency cut out his tongue. I swear it is true.
Therefore, until we receive the reinforcements promised us...
So people can still laugh in California.
I'd begun to think they'd lost the habit.
- Your name?
- He claims to be the son of the alcalde.
I claim nothing. I am Diego Vega, son of His Excellency, Don Alejandro.
And this, although I find it greatly changed, is my home.
Your pardon, Don Diego. I'd not heard of your returning. Welcome to California.
I'm Capitán Esteban Pasquale, military aid to the alcalde.
I'm honoured, but bewildered.
Why has my father turned his home into a barracks?
Conditions have changed since you left.
Your father resigned. Age, you know.
Since then, the peons have become more industrious.
As to the caballeros, they're encouraged to think of their own affairs.
We take care of the government.
I see.
- Tell me, who holds the office now?
- Don Luis Quintero. I'll take you to him.
Thank you, but I should like to see my family as quickly as possible.
- Where are they living?
- At your old hacienda.
But His Excellency'll never forgive me if I let you go without a word of welcome from him.
I'm quite sure that you'll save me a reprimand.
How could I refuse a man anything with a naked sword in his hand?
So a wit has come to Los Angeles.
Carry out your orders, Sergeant.
Foolish habit of mine.
Some men play with a glove, or a monocle, or a snuffbox.
Churchmen finger their beads.
I toy with a sword.
Do you fancy the weapon?
I know very little about it, my dear capitán.
Swordplay is such a violent business.
So, this is the bird that killed the black-breasted red?
Was it a bloody battle?
At the side of the pit, all the people were covered with blood.
Pity I missed it.
What are you asking for him?
This is a noble bird. Well tested.
I'm asking 40 pesos for him.
40 pesos? Esteban, this cheating dog should have his taxes raised.
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
The bird is yours, as a gift.
- Not one centimo will he cost you.
- That's a better attitude. Much better.
Turn him over to my handlers.
And what caballero is this?
Or is he some young lord from Spain?
A good guess, Excellency.
He's just from Spain.
This is Don Diego Vega, son of your respected predecessor.
I thought such fabric came from Madrid.
Must have cost you plenty, eh?
The caballero is here for words of welcome, not to discuss the price of his clothes.
Of course.
To be sure.
Welcome back, young sir.
Regard this house as still your home.
Luis, a ship has arrived from Spain.
The shops will have something worth looking at at last. I need...
Money.
It's always money.
I don't know this caballero.
- He's just off your precious ship from Spain.
- How delightful.
Will one of you ill-mannered boors present him?
Don Diego Vega.
Señora Inez de Quintero.
My wife.
Your Excellency is a very fortunate man.
I'm not so sure.
She thinks pesos grow on mulberry trees.
Your husband was also fascinated by the caballero's clothes.
Your pardon.
We're overwhelmed by the latest fashions.
And no wonder.
What is there here to interest a woman?
I long for the life you've been leading.
The gaiety and splendour of the court.
- Patience, my love. You'll see it all someday.
- Doubtless, when I'm an old hag.
That catastrophe could never overtake you.
Did you hear? How easily he makes pretty speeches.
I regret that...
You were saying?
I was saying that I must tear myself away and make some speeches to my father and mother.
Don't leave me to these barbarians.
Come to the shops with me and help me make my selections.
Oh, you tempt me.
I love the shimmer of satin and silk, the matching of one delicate shade against the other.
Then there's the choosing of scents and lotions - attar of rose, carnation, crushed lily, and musk.
- As for ornaments and jewels...
- But Don Diego must see his parents.
Too true.
Duty rather than pleasure.
I'll see you to the door.
That's one little peacock that won't give us any trouble.
You think not?
The capitán is jealous. The fop has pricked the fencing master. Touché.
I don't like such jests.
Your eye might fail you.
It's possible.
- Who was that?
- No one you know.
- Someone new. Very charming.
- He must be, from the colour in your cheeks.
At last, after all these months in this dreary place, someone who knows the newest fashions, the latest dances, how to flatter a woman.
- When can I meet him?
- Listen to the child.
You're much too young to cope with his sort.
Why do you allow her to wear that mantilla?
It makes her look like a woman grown.
I am a woman grown.
I'll be 18 my next birthday.
Carmen Castellano is a month younger and already wed.
Her grandmother was a peon.
Such riffraff wed when they like.
You have the blood of the hidalgos in your veins.
Keep it cool, my girl, or I'll whisk you into a convent.
I pity your poor mount, Sergeant.
Such a heavy whip.
Do you think I'd strike a good mare with this?
It would ruin her, break her spirit.
See? She didn't flick an ear.
She knows. We are collecting taxes from the peons today.
And you use that little switch on the taxpayers?
Only when they are stubborn.
When you come to collect my taxes,
I won't be stubborn, I promise you.
Turn right in here.
Mother.
- My son. My baby.
- Mother.
Hello, María.
Good old Juan, fat as ever.
Hello, Manuel. And José.
Where's Father?
In the study with Fray Felipe.
Come, he's longing to see you.
Take Don Diego's things to his room.
I tell you, these conditions are beyond bearing.
This whole district, from the hills of Verdugo to the shores of Del Rey, is a stench in the nostrils of heaven.
- I know.
- You know, yes.
- But what do you do about it? Nothing.
- What can...
Father.
My boy.
Padre.
Welcome back to your home and my heart.
- I've missed your wise counsel.
- Not too greatly, I suspect.
You remember Don Miguel and Don José?
- Have you returned to steal more melons?
- Melons?
This scamp and my scapegrace son crept into my garden and gorged themselves on my seed melons one year.
But God punished us. We were visited by the father of all bellyaches.
But he's ripe for more than boyish pranks now.
- I feel good muscle here.
- Arms, muscle... You men.
Is he without a face? Can't you see he's even better-looking than when he left?
You should have seen me when I approached the Spanish throne for the first time.
They said I looked like a frightened gopher.
More like a young angel, I'm sure.
An angel. That's what we need in California now. An angel with a flaming sword.
Please, don't start that.
He didn't come home to get himself killed.
Hold your tongue. Go to your women.
Leave my son to me. Sit down, Diego.
- What is all this, Father?
- Well, I am no longer alcalde.
- In my place is a man...
- In his place sits a viper so foul and black...
Ah, to be alone with him for five little minutes.
Long enough to tear his windpipe out of his throat.
God forgive me.
- Why did you resign in the first place?
- I was forced out of office.
They threatened to burn the homes of the peons.
- And now he sits here doing nothing, when...
- Enough, Felipe.
The friar urges me to lead the caballeros in a revolt which would surely fail against a garrison of trained soldiers.
Even if I thought it would succeed,
I'd refuse just the same.
- But why?
- Because the law is the law.
I will not rebel against the government
I served for 30 years.
But that government is now vile and corrupt.
I know, but two wrongs don't make a right, and never will.
- That is my feeling also.
- Sometimes, one must fight fire with fire.
I am a Vega. I will not follow the lawless footsteps of Luis Quintero.
- Nor will my son.
- No, of course not.
By the way, I went directly from the ship to our old home.
I met Señor Quintero and his charming wife.
I found them very pleasant and agreeable.
Pleasant scorpions.
Agreeable rattlesnakes.
Oh, Padre. The alcalde spoke with great respect of you, Father.
I must admit he hasn't troubled me or my flocks so far.
That being the case, why get overly excited in this heat?
I know I'm going to miss the scented breezes of Spain.
Then you believe we should not be moved by injustice and cruelty until it touches us?
But, my dear Padre, such things exist in the world and always will.
By the way, I took up sleight of hand while I was in Madrid.
It's all the rage just now.
Watch closely.
To think that the boy that I helped to raise, the boy that I taught to hold a firm wrist behind a true point, has turned into a puppy.
How vexatious. Well, I must go and remove the dust of travel.
I'll see you later, Father.
Stay where you are.
Put this up.
Put it up. Be quick about it.
Back to the barracks.
I don't understand why you insist on this stupid drive. And without an escort.
- I have my reasons.
- Suppose you share them with me.
Look... Gold. An agent of the Bank of Madrid is meeting us in a quiet inn.
This goes to Spain.
For us, my love.
I see.
How stupid of me.
- A military guard would...
- Let Esteban know about this transaction.
- Of course, he would have claimed his share.
- I'm afraid so.
Don't move if you want to live.
- A bandit.
- I have distressing news for you.
I had a small drinking bout with the agent of the Bank of Madrid.
While in his cups, the fellow was somewhat indiscreet.
A drunken man is untrustworthy.
I will act for him. Hand it over.
- And that little trinket.
- You would rob a woman?
- I can't afford gallantries.
- I refuse. You dare not take it.
Quickly. I should hate to mark such a lovely cheek.
This time I take only your money.
Next time...
What a nice, quiet study, Your Excellency.
I like a quiet room. Very quiet.
What do you want?
A little talk with you, that's all - if we come to an understanding.
Do you think the climate in Spain will agree with you?
Why do you ask?
Because you're either going there or to some place you might not like so well.
Which will it be?
- Spain.
- It's a very wise choice.
Now to the matter of your successor.
What do you think of Don Alejandro Vega?
He's had experience.
- What does it matter to me?
- Nothing.
But to the people of this district, a great deal.
When you resign, you'll appoint
Don Alejandro as your successor.
As you wish.
This will remind you that
I have been here once, and can return.
- Close your eyes.
- What are you going to do?
- What's that?
- The point of my sword against your throat.
Don't move until I take it away.
- What if I faint?
- You won't.
What's this?
Are you trying to commit suicide?
Speak up.
What's the matter?
- He was here.
- Who was here?
Ridiculous.
- Your fears have addled your brain.
- I tell you, he was here. In this very room.
- Anybody pass by this way?
- No one.
- Has anyone entered this room?
- His Excellency and yourself.
- Anyone else?
- No.
Do you need any more proof?
You must have fallen asleep and dreamed it.
Did I dream that?
Sergeant, turn out the guard. Zorro is somewhere on the grounds. Find him.
I still can't believe the fellow was here.
If you'd sat here with a sword at your throat, perhaps you'd believe it.
- How on earth did he get in?
- That's what I'd like to know.
- And it's your business to find out.
- What did he say?
He wants me in Spain and Vega in my place.
Now we have something.
This Zorro is a caballero.
A ordinary brigand wouldn't concern himself with Vega.
- It would serve you right if I did go to Spain.
- And give up 50,000 pesos a year?
I can't collect it if I'm dead.
And you get a third for protecting me.
But what protection! You can't keep even keep one mad dog off my neck.
Can't I?
I'll find him, I promise you.
In the meantime, I'll put a solid wall of men around this house night and day.
- I can't afford to lose you, my dear Luis.
- No, You can't.
Your pickings end if anything happens to me.
That's exactly what I meant, Excellency.
Blessed Mother, send someone to take me from this dreary place.
Someone I can love and respect.
Let him be kind and brave.
And handsome, please, dear Mother.
Fray Ramón, I didn't see you when I came in.
I'm not Fray Ramón.
I'm Fray Pablo, from the mission.
I've just been spending the evening with Fray Ramón.
Father, I was asking the Holy Mother to save me from a convent.
- Is that a sin?
- The sin would be in sending you to one.
- I don't understand.
- Well, a young girl with your...
I just think that you would probably be more useful outside a convent than in.
- You mean in serving God?
- Yes, in a way.
In what way?
Well, the Church must have sons and daughters, if she is to flourish.
- Do you follow me?
- I think so.
- You mean that I might marry and...
- Yes, exactly.
Strong sons and fine daughters to the glory of God.
I was praying just now for a husband.
You were? Fine.
I mean, it's quite natural at your age, my child.
Yes, but it's not natural for a girl of my age to long for a husband to rescue her.
- From what?
- Father...
Will you sit here and talk to me for a little while? I'm troubled, deeply.
I want to leave this lonely place.
I want to meet young people.
Girls of my own age.
No one ever comes here.
The caballeros avoid this place like the pest house.
- Why?
- They hate my Uncle Luis.
You know, I feel that there's something wrong about him.
Decidedly wrong.
What do you think?
If people hate him as you say, you have your answer there.
Then I was right. Perhaps I should be glad my Aunt Inez is sending me to a convent.
No, don't be glad about that.
I mean, probably your aunt feels that that atmosphere is better for a young girl,
- but I'm convinced...
- Inez? Oh, no.
No. That's not why she's sending me.
María says she's jealous.
She says it's because I'm good-looking.
- María has excellent eyesight.
- Thank you, Father, but are you sure?
No one except María ever says I'm pretty.
Pretty? Why, you are more radiant, more lovely than a morning in June.
You really think that?
- With all my heart.
- I've never heard such words before.
They make me almost lose my breath.
You should hear such words every hour of the day.
You're not in the least like Fray Ramón.
You talk so strangely.
You're not a padre. You're an impostor.
You're wearing a sword.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Zorro broke into the house and threatened your uncle.
They think he's still hiding somewhere close by.
Come along. Lock the doors after we leave, Fray Ramón.
The beast may try to rob the altar.
Good night, Padre.
Padre, you dropped something.
There he is.
There.
Three pesos.
Three pesos.
Four pesos.
- Nine pesos.
- I cannot pay so much.
I swear, it will leave me without a centavo.
- Nine pesos.
- But we will starve.
- How can I feed my family?
- Nine pesos.
Please, I beg of you.
My little girl...
That's all.
I'll relieve you of that, Sergeant.
I'll take that.
Get back.
After him.
Hear our prayer.
And drive far away from it... all the snares of the enemy.
And let thy holy angels dwell therein... to keep us at peace.
And may thy blessings... be upon us always.
Good evening, Padre.
It was so dull at home, and I remembered that you played a fair game of chess.
So I took the liberty of riding over and setting up the men.
What's the meaning of this?
How dare you?
We are after Zorro.
We saw him ride toward the mission.
Good evening, Sergeant.
- Zorro, you say? What's he done now?
- Enough to get himself hanged.
- Have you seen him?
- I have only this moment left the chapel.
- How long have you been here?
- Some little time. It seems like hours.
I've been waiting to play chess with the good padre.
- It's a dull game, but what can one do?
- You have seen or heard nothing?
Of Zorro? Heaven spare me.
My blood chills at the thought.
Out of here.
Search the grounds.
What's disturbing you, Padre?
Thoughts of that bandit?
- Puppy.
- Oh, my dear Padre, really.
When I think of what one man, single-handed, has accomplished against these devils, and see you, the last of the Vegas, trembling at the very mention of his name, I could...
Can't you even listen to me?
Ordinarily, I'd drink in every word you say, but just now...
Thank you, Mother.
- Quick. Hide this plunder.
- Plunder?
Don't stand there gaping at me like a fish. Put it away.
- What is this?
- It's some of the alcalde's gold.
And this I took from his charming wife.
It's pretty, don't you think?
You took it?
Have you seen this one, Padre?
So my old mentor has no more wit than the rest of them, eh?
Are you trying to make me the receiver of stolen goods?
No, the dispenser.
This gold was wrung from the peons.
It's up to us to restore it to them.
My boy.
My boy.
My Diego.
Then you will lead your people against these scorpions?
No, we'd be no match for their trained troops. My father was right about that.
You must have had the alcalde at your mercy when you took the gold from him.
I would have snuffed him out like a candle.
God forgive me.
It would accomplish nothing.
Anotherjust like him would take his place.
I see.
I see everything.
Diego, don't deceive your father any longer.
- It's not fair to him.
- I don't like doing it. Believe me.
But I must.
My father is such a stickler for law and order, that I'm afraid he might spoil all the fun.
But what do you hope to achieve all alone, taking his money?
Oh, no.
But I may be able to persuade him to resign and name my father in his place.
- Amusing, don't you think?
- If you live.
Doña Inez begs you to make yourself comfortable. She'll be down shortly.
What's this?
- Don Diego Vega.
- Oh, yes. What can I do for you?
Have you forgotten that you urged me to regard this house as still my home?
Did I?
It's very good of you to remember the offer, but didn't you have trouble getting in?
Oh, no. I had a note from Doña Inez asking me to ride with her this morning, and I just showed it to the sentries.
Excellent.
Come into my study till my wife appears.
It's been Esteban's privilege to ride with her each morning.
Why is this house so closely guarded?
I swear I saw a full company around it.
- I wish there were twice as many.
- Their clatter would drive me to distraction.
I find it reassuring.
Let me show you something, young man.
Look.
The mark of Zorro.
He came here one night.
He threatened my life and left that.
I should be petrified.
He's mad, of course.
Quite mad.
- You think so?
- Of course.
There was a case in Madrid, almost identical.
This fellow's mark was a cross.
He was a madman.
Cunning beyond belief.
They always are.
He killed 40 people.
Slit their throats from ear to ear.
Warned them first, you know, and then...
It's a pity your sense of duty keeps you here.
- Frightful risk.
- Sense of duty?
Yes, of course.
I'm so sorry to have kept you.
Esteban was surly about our little ride.
- I'd promised the morning to him, it seems.
- Your invitation was a smile from heaven.
- I was positively suffocating with boredom.
- Then let's fly. I'm dying for a canter.
Goodbye, Luis.
Don't work too hard.
Goodbye, Excellency.
Esteban, Vegajust told me a horrible tale about a madman in Madrid, like this Zorro.
- He thinks I risk my life by staying here.
- Forget your fears. I have a plan.
Yes?
What is it?
Don Alejandro is the leader of the caballeros.
Zorro wants you to appoint him in your place.
- What do you gather from that?
- Go on.
Doesn't it suggest to you that Zorro is the tool of Don Alejandro?
- Perhaps, but how can we prove it?
- We can at least help the situation.
- How?
- Form an alliance with Don Alejandro.
That's impossible.
You know Vega's attitude.
Perfectly, but Lolita should have a husband.
What could be stronger than a matrimonial alliance?
Royal families keep the peace of Europe in bridal beds.
Diego and Lolita.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Diego, talking with you is like a drink of cool water in the desert.
- Oh, it's a pity.
- What?
- I mustn't make you discontented.
- Oh, please. Of what were you thinking?
I was just thinking how you're being wasted here.
Your beauty, your gift for words, your perfect poise.
You were born for something higher and more civilised than this provincial life.
I know.
- May I tell you something?
- Anything.
Yes, of course I may.
I felt from the moment we met that we...
Esteban is urging me to leave my husband and go to Spain with him.
- Oh, but my dear, no.
- But I'm dying here.
Go to Spain, but not with Esteban.
With whom, then?
- With your husband.
- My husband?
- Go to romantic, beautiful Spain with Luis?
- Let me explain.
As the wife of the one-time alcalde of Los Angeles, you'd be received at court.
But as the companion of a second-rate soldier of fortune, you'd be ostracised.
I see.
But Luis at court, imagine.
In Spain the husbands of adorable ladies are merely background.
- I'd be lost among so many.
- Not you.
You'd need only one "friend" to introduce you into the proper circles.
But I have no such friend in Madrid.
Who knows? I don't intend to remain in California for ever.
- What you suggest is utterly impossible.
- I'll give a dowry of 20,000 pesos. 25,000.
Are you buying my son, Señor Quintero?
- There's the practical side to consider.
- It doesn't enter into this.
You come here on a friendly mission with half a company of troops. Why?
Not to threaten you, Don Alejandro.
It's because of this Zorro.
Zorro is only a symptom. This district is bleeding under your vile administration.
I would never appear to condone it by marriage between our families.
In that case, the friendly attitude
I've taken towards you, will cease.
What is all this turmoil about?
His Excellency has offered a marriage between his niece Lolita and you.
His niece?
How flattering.
But why should that cause an argument on a hot day like this?
- Do I have to explain?
- Your father resents my efforts to make the people of the district more industrious than under his regime.
Grinding them into poverty and despair to line your own pockets is hardly...
Oh, politics, politics.
What have they to do with my marriage?
- You'd marry into the family of this...?
- How can I tell until I've seen her?
- She may look like her uncle.
- Quite right. I...
Oh, no. She's a sweet little dove. It would desolate us to have her leave the nest.
If she were Venus, she'd still be his niece.
But, after all,
I'm not marrying His Excellency.
Don't you think the wishes of your father in this sort of matter should be considered?
I had no say in my father's marriage.
Why should he try to instruct me in mine?
Exactly.
Will you dine with us tonight?
- Charmed.
- We'll expect you at eight o'clock.
Diego, what have you done?
It will be all right.
No matter what you think now, please don't worry.
This was your doing, you sly beast.
You gave Luis the idea of this marriage.
Alliances for the good of the state have been fashionable since the dawn of history.
- María, my knees are shaking.
- Yes, that is natural.
- Shall I bow, or give him my hand to kiss?
- Both. First the hand, then the bow.
It's 20 minutes past the hour.
What can be keeping him?
Well, well, well.
Here you are at last.
I was afraid that you might have been waylaid by that Zorro fellow.
Oh, heaven spare me.
- I am dazzled.
- And here is our little dove, Lolita.
- I am honoured.
- Charmed, I'm sure.
May I present Señora María de López?
You'll forgive me for being late.
They heated the water for my bath too early.
It was positively tepid. By the time more was carried and properly scented...
Life can be trying, don't you think?
- Oh, please.
- Courage.
Well, shall we dine?
Come, Diego.
His bath was tepid.
Poor Lolita. I'm afraid her wedded life will be the same.
- Please do that again.
- As you wish. Observe closely.
- Amazing.
- Quite simple.
- Have you seen this one?
- No.
Now, observe very closely.
- Frightfully amusing.
- Yes, I did this one for His Majesty.
- It must be heavenly at court.
- It's the one bearable spot on earth.
Speaking of that Zorro, Excellency, could you provide me with an escort home?
On the way here, I fancied that cutthroat lurking in every shadow. I was unnerved.
How distressing.
- You don't approve of my request.
- You called her hero a cutthroat.
Have you met the fellow?
I've never so much as seen his face.
I happen to admire courage.
Dashing about with a cutlass has been out of fashion since the Middle Ages.
It seems to be quite effective. He is like a lion among a lot of frightened sheep.
A madman, that's what he is.
Undoubtedly.
Capitán, you seem to regard that poor fruit as an enemy.
A rival.
My dear Esteban is for ever thrusting at this and that.
He used to be a fencing instructor in Barcelona.
How exhausting.
- I didn't find it so.
- Then why did you give it up?
- Unfortunately, I killed a man of influence.
- A lady was involved, I believe.
The gentleman's wife, no doubt?
Just how did you mean that?
I'd hoped to be amusing.
Have I failed?
Somewhat.
With me.
What are the new dance steps?
You know them all, I suppose.
- I'm afraid so.
- I would so love to have you show me.
Gladly.
- Inez would enjoy it more.
- Nonsense, my child. Dance with him.
Play "El Sombrero Blanco".
I never dreamed dancing could be so wonderful.
I found it rather fatiguing.
- If you'll excuse me, I wish to retire.
- So sorry.
- What's got into the girl?
- Who knows?
- Our little dove has flown.
- I don't like it.
You can't be serious about this marriage.
But, my dear, it's perfect.
You and I could be seen together anywhere in Madrid without any danger of gossip.
- Excellency, your niece is charming.
- A sweet child.
May I plead with you for her hand in marriage?
A refusal would crush me.
She's yours, my dear Diego, with all my blessings.
Who's there?
- I have a confession to make.
- Please go. You'll be caught.
I must talk to you.
Now, look here, my girl.
What do you mean by running away from the man to whom I've promised you in marriage?
- You've done that without asking me?
- Of course.
What do you know about such things?
And it's time that you understood that...
- Who's that?
- No one.
Forgive me, my dear.
I've been an old fool.
You seem to know how to handle these matters much better than your Uncle Luis.
You?
Don't come in here.
I have something important to say to you and I don't want to be interrupted.
You, pretending to be Zorro.
I don't care to hear anything you have to say.
So unlock that door and go.
I'm glad to see you took the advice
I gave you in the chapel.
About not hiding such beauty in a convent.
What did you say?
You're more lovely, more radiant than a morning in June.
Surely I must be dreaming.
- You are Zorro.
- Yes, Lolita.
In order to accomplish what I set out to do,
I've had to deceive people, including you.
Yes, I see.
I understand.
You don't have to explain.
You came here to tell me that asking to marry me was just part of the game.
Oh, no. That's the one real thing about this whole masquerade.
- Go quickly.
- Ride with me tomorrow.
Yes, but go.
Be careful.
- Open the door.
- Yes, I'm coming.
You seem upset, my dear.
Have you been crying?
- Yes, I have.
- I understand.
This marriage was your uncle's idea.
He's not your type, and far too sophisticated.
- You really think so?
- Beyond a question.
I saw how he affected you tonight.
My heart bled for you, my dear.
When you tell Luis you'll have none of this marriage, you'll have my full support.
I hardly know what to say.
Uncle Luis has done so much for me.
Nonsense. He has no right to expect you to spoil your life.
Any marriage is better than none, I suppose.
Perhaps I could learn to tolerate Diego.
I do so want to please Uncle Luis.
There's such a thing as carrying gratitude too far.
We can't ask you to spend your life with a man you think repulsive.
We'll talk of this again in the morning.
Good night, my dear.
Past midnight.
He's not home yet.
- How can you read?
- It's the latest European styles.
- Bustles are coming in, it seems.
- Bustles! What is a bustle?
It's something to build you up here.
Our only son in the clutches of those polecats, and you sit there planning to decorate your...
There you are. Why didn't you spend the entire night with your delightful friends?
What have you done about that girl?
Well, how did you get out of it?
She's perfectly charming.
A lovely, unspoiled child.
- You'll be delighted with her, Father.
- I will be delighted? What have you done?
I've just taken the first steps toward making you a grandfather.
What?
What a son you bore me.
An alliance with those terrible people.
Why did you do it?
- For the best reason in the world.
- What is that?
- Lolita Quintero.
- She attracts you?
- It's more than that. From the day I first saw...
- I thought you hadn't met her until tonight.
I did catch a glimpse of her some time ago, and...
You're concealing something from us.
I'm sure of it.
- It's time you went to bed.
- Very well.
But, Diego, tell me as soon as you can.
I will, Mother.
- What's the meaning of that?
- Gonzales was collecting taxes.
A priest resisted.
The fool gave him ten lashes.
- Send Gonzales to me.
- I wish I could.
- What's to prevent it?
- The total disappearance of Gonzales.
- He's gone? Where?
- To Hades, I hope.
I'll collect the taxes myself from now on.
That should teach them.
What's that?
You...
- What's that?
- Sergeant Gonzales. I think he's dead.
Dead, you say?
- He's alive.
- He's got a Z on his chest.
José.
How is the little one?
She is well again.
I brought this to give thanks to the church.
Give thanks in your heart.
Buy milk for the child with this.
No. This is for the church.
I come at precisely the right moment, it seems.
- I'll take that.
- These are the funds of the mission.
Not any longer.
Hand them over.
- I refuse.
- In that case, I shall take them.
You should have been a soldier rather than a churchman.
No wonder you chose the Church.
- Where did you get this?
- I'll tell you nothing.
Run me through and have done with it.
No, my dear Padre.
We shall presently hang you.
For the last time. If you marry that girl, you leave this house for ever.
It might be rather amusing to live with the Quinteros.
If I'd only left him in Spain.
Wait till you see her.
She's just like this blossom.
I'll never see her.
I promise you that.
- We are not at home.
- I'm at home to the señorita. Show her in.
- So you defy me, too?
- You're not being sensible.
- Father, this is Lolita.
- I am honoured.
And my mother.
Please forgive me, but would it be possible to see you alone for a moment?
Señorita, will you answer me one question?
- Certainly.
- Do you want to marry my son?
- Why, yes.
- Why?
Well, I love him.
You are right, my son.
She is like the flower.
Something terrible has happened.
They've arrested Fray Felipe.
They say he is Zorro and they are going to hang him.
- Where is he now?
- At the barracks. What can you do?
I don't know yet.
So far I've only frightened your uncle.
This may mean I'll have to do more than that.
Do you understand?
If that becomes necessary, will it make any difference between us?
Sentries!
There's someone in that chair. Seize him.
Diego, what are you doing here?
You frightened me half out of my wits.
This is too much, really.
It's distressing enough to call on my betrothed and not find her at home.
- Now to be manhandled by these ruffians.
- Leave us.
Where is Lolita?
Oh, riding, driving, walking.
What does a young girl do?
Am I to understand that my betrothed is allowed to wander about the countryside without a duenna?
I protest, Your Excellency.
I protest strongly.
I can't discuss that now.
Do you know Zorro had a priest for an accomplice?
We arrested him today.
And another horrible thing happened to me.
Sergeant Gonzales was beaten half to death by Zorro.
He shoved him over the wall right before my eyes.
How frightful.
But after all, it was harder on Gonzales.
This is no time forjesting.
Perhaps, that madman is lurking on the grounds right now.
What shall I do?
I offer rewards and nothing happens.
He may change his mind about you.
Those creatures usually do, I believe.
He may decide to cut the throat of someone else.
- Must you always talk of throat-cutting?
- How thoughtless of me.
- What you need is a drop of brandy.
- Yes, brandy...
It's gone. I'm surrounded by idiots.
Stupid servants, stupid soldiers.
I admire you tremendously.
Your courage, your fortitude.
Why, a weaker man would forget his civic duty and get away from all this.
- You rang, Your Excellency?
- Yes, brandy.
- On the desk, Your Excellency.
- It's not on the desk. Bring some.
A situation of this sort would wreck my constitution in a week.
But then I haven't the iron nerve of Your Excellency.
Your Excellency, come quickly.
Something has happened in the cellar.
Guards.
You, follow me.
Look.
Look, Your Excellency.
Here in the cellar, right below my study.
Here's his trail.
It goes this way.
It ends here.
He couldn't have gone through the wall.
He's not human. He's...
Light my way out of here. Quick!
You were right.
I'll leave this cursed place.
I'll do as he asks.
Pen, paper...
A man should consider his wife.
Inez has gone crazy over the idea of Madrid.
She's been at me night and day to take her there.
This should do it.
This should suit that maniac.
There, look it over.
That's very direct.
But you forgot to sign.
- Sign what?
- My resignation.
Zorro will kill me if I stay.
You may escape him, but I will surely kill you if you write any more of these.
But I'm in grave danger.
Diego here will bear me out.
You're in even greater danger than he thinks.
So you tried to get gold out of the country?
If you ever again take one peso of mine,
I'll cut your throat from ear to ear.
I must ask you to change the subject.
He objects to talk of throat-cutting.
Quiet, you popinjay.
I've no reason for letting you live either.
What a pleasant coincidence.
I feel exactly the same way about you.
You wouldn't care to translate that feeling into action, would you?
I might be tempted, if I had a weapon.
Would you?
Now, please, gentlemen.
- This is going much too far.
- It's only to serve you, Excellency.
You have a champion, Luis.
And what a champion.
I'll make it short, and save you fatigue.
- Sentries!
- No interference, Excellency, please.
We have a hero with us.
- Are you all right, Diego?
- Ask the capitán.
Get out.
The fencing master has met his equal.
Careful.
- Are you tiring, Diego?
- No, Excellency, I'll take you on in a moment.
- It's a good effort, capitán.
- My next will be better, my fancy clown.
- The capitán's blade is not so firm.
- Still firm enough to run you through.
I needed that scratch to awaken me.
He's dead.
Well, he's been troublesome lately.
And you killed him.
A secret stairway from the cellar.
We just discovered it.
A secret stairway?
Leading here?
Good. Very good.
Excellent.
You shall be rewarded.
Sentries!
Keep that man covered.
Take him to the guardhouse and lock him in the cell.
- The strongest cell you have.
- Why arrest me, Excellency?
For three reasons. First, you have mud from the cellar on your boots.
Second, that secret stairway happens to be in your old home.
And third, you handle a sword like a devil from hell.
And that's exactly where you're going, Señor Zorro.
That's a pretty way to treat your future nephew, Uncle Luis.
No more of your wit.
Take him away.
You, Morales...
Send the officer of the day to me. I want all caballeros and peons summoned here.
All caballeros are requested to report at the alcalde's residence immediately.
- At this hour? Ridiculous.
- The alcalde's orders.
Sergeant, assemble your men for firing-squad duty.
- But why did they arrest Diego?
- I don't know.
Luis won't tell me.
He must have lost his mind.
Come in.
His Excellency requests you ladies to stay in your rooms tonight.
- Why?
- I cannot say. I was ordered to tell you.
Firing squad, forward.
- Good evening.
- Why are we meeting here, Señor Vega?
What do you know, Alejandro?
Nothing. I was forced to come here like the rest of you.
They must be up to something.
Good evening, señores.
It's a pleasure to see you here.
Get to the point. Why have you dragged us out of our homes at this hour?
To witness a delightful spectacle.
You will find it particularly interesting.
I'm executing a caballero at midnight.
- What caballero?
- Who is it?
The man you selected from among you to defy me, to threaten my life.
I brought you here to see him die as a lesson to the lot of you.
I, for one, don't know what you're talking about.
You almost convince me.
Too bad you're about to lose the best actor among you.
But in a few moments, you'll see your precious Zorro shot.
Observe very closely.
Watch the candle.
Blow.
You should really see something worthwhile, like changing a copper coin into solid gold.
- Can you do that?
- The good padre here has seen me do it.
- Many times.
- It was a secret discovered by Merlin.
It's been handed down through a long line of sorcerers to some of us living today.
You can change a centavo into gold?
- Easily.
- Please, do that for me.
I am very weary.
I must seek repose.
I have a wife and seven children, and the little I earn isn't enough for them.
Please, make gold for them and I'll pray for you.
If I must, I must.
Now, hold the centavo in your closed fist.
Tightly now.
Put your fist well through the bars.
Cold iron will spoil everything.
I take your fist gently, like this.
Open the door.
Be quick about it.
Get in. Get down under there, close to the wall.
And not a sound.
Close the door.
Hide this in your robe.
Sit down.
And now, you will behold the result of your rebellious plans. Come in.
Here is Zorro the fox, safely trapped.
Diego!
What is this?
What idiotic joke is this?
- As if you didn't know.
- Luis Quintero, you are a fool.
Zorro is a man. This is my worthless, trick-playing offspring.
Have you seen this one, Father?
Help!
Zorro is loose.
- Señores, are you with me?
- I am with you.
God, forgive me.
God, forgive me.
What a splendid audience you have.
Peons, caballeros, everyone.
- It was thoughtful of you to have them here.
- Luis, what's happened?
Good evening, ladies. You're just in time.
His Excellency is about to make an address.
Address? What shall I say?
You know.
The little matter of your resignation.
Quiet!
Quiet for His Excellency.
We're waiting. Go on.
Good people of Los Angeles, owing to my ceaseless efforts to improve conditions in the district... my health is endangered.
I have therefore decided to give up my office and go to Spain.
To succeed me as alcalde of this district,
I am naming my illustrious predecessor,
Don Alejandro Vega.
And now, Your Excellency, I personally will accompany you to the wharf at San Pedro.
I wish to bless your voyage, and ask God to reward you according to your merits.
Spain...
Spain!
Diego, when may we expect you and our dear little Lolita in Madrid?
- We'll follow the customs of California.
- What do you mean?
We are going to marry, and raise fat children and watch our vineyards grow.

The princess -
Have you got news for me?
No, Master.
- Dead?
- She still sleeps.
- You followed my orders?
- Yes, Master.
- And the blind man?
- He has been found.
Hmm.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
What? Your cur would bark?
Afine reward for charity.
If charity be false as that coin.
Then you cheat, son of a burnt father.
A blind man cannot tell truth from false.
Alas, I cannot tell day from night.
It was my dog.
- How can a dog tell bad from good?
- See for yourself.
Now, by the wonder of Allah -
It is a false coin, and I, myself, knew it not!
Come, O frequenter of tree trunks... now which is the bad one?
This is no dog, but the reincarnation of a tax collector!
O ye whom Allah gave
the gift of sight... to fill your eyes with beauty and delight... spare me a thought to whom your wondrous world... is but a city of eternal night.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
- Bring him to me.
- Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Pray for me.
My name is Halima.
- I do not know you?
- Does one always know one's friends?
I have none to know.
Can you not trust in one
who brings not words, but deeds♪
In my house, there is food and rest.
And what is mine is yours.
- Why should you offer this?
- For your prayers.
That is much for little.
- Take my hand.
- There's no need. My dog sees for me.
He gives me more than ever he can receive, like all dogs.
This is a sleep beyond my knowledge.
Only this I know: When the blind man comes to her, she will be cured.
Strange, Master, he can do something all your powers cannot.
I'll make him do it for me and cast him away.
But she loves the blind man.
Do you call the lisping of two children in a garden love?
Love she has yet to learn.
And I am here to teach her.
- Poor blind beggar.
- Even more unfortunate than you know.
- That cannot be.
- But we are unveiled.
And I am... veiled.
- Tell us your name.
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad!
- Ahmad, you'll beg no more.
- Nor journey on.
- Stay here with us.
O sovereigns of silkiness,
I am sure you are beautiful... but for me there is no staying.
I must on, seeking the one I love, whom I have lost.
Men with two eyes often seek all their lives and fail to find that one.
Stay. There are great doctors here.
They may restore your sight.
That would be the blackest day of all my days.
- You talk in riddles.
- I will give you the answer. Listen.
There was once a king, son of a king and of a hundred kings.
His subjects countless, his wealth untellable... his power absolute.
And this dog was not a dog... but a youth who lived in Bagdad and became dear to the king.
But in those days,
he was nothing but a little thief.
Why do you smell my fish, master of a copper coin? Be off! Be off!
Shall I call the khadi's clubmen? Eh?
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief! Stop that thief!
Ahmad the king.
Son of Akbar, grandson of Haroun-el-Rachid... the great, the illustrious... lord of the earth, defender of the faith... servant of the all-highest... but master of all men.
Ahmad the king!
Ahmad the king.
Alas, I was that mighty man.
365 wives were mine.
In my heart there was no love.
Fifty palaces, and I had no home.
Richest among my subjects,
I was the poorest of the poor.
Every desire satisfied,
I grew empty of desire.
And in my whole vast kingdom,
I could find nothing to do - no task, no aim, no purpose - for always my grand vizierJaffar stood between me and my people.
Another execution.
Why had he to die?
He had been thinking, my lord and master.
- Is it a crime then to think?
- In a subject, it's quite unpardonable.
Are men only to be ruled by fear?
Men are evil - hatred behind their eyes, lies on their lips, betrayal in their hearts.
You will learn one day, great king... that there are about three things that men respect: the lash that descends, the yoke that breaks and the sword that slays.
By the power and terror of these, you may conquer the earth.
Do I want to conquer the earth?
What do you want, my lord and master?
I thought I might try to give them happiness.
Happiness. They are fools and knaves.
Your grandsire knew it, and if you would know it too... do as he did.
One night, when darkness falls... leave your palace, go among your people... mix with the crowds, go into their houses... listen, observe and remember.
- Tonight, Jaffar.
- Tonight, my king.
- Your people, my king.
- I've never been so close to them.
Go. Listen, observe and remember.
It is told, though Allah be wiser or more merciful...
there was in the past of the ages
a king among kings...
a master of arms and of armies,
of vessels and auxiliaries.
And this master of time and people
was an oppressor to both...
and the earth was as pitch in the faces
ofhis subjects and his slaves.
- What's he saying?
- And they groaned together in secret.
Why, I don't know.
Is it the king he's talking about?
Don't ask questions.
There are spies everywhere.
You must be careful in Bagdad.
I'm a stranger here. Surely you can tell me what the old man's talking about.
Oh, about foolish hopes... about a prophecy, about a liberator.
Only fools and children believe it.
A liberator indeed.
Not while Ahmad is king.
And they groaned together in secret and were slain in the marketplace.
But a wise man among the sages of Bagdad
comforted them with a prophecy...
saying, "In the fullness of years,
a liberator shall come upon you...
"and this shall be the sign ofhim:
he shall be the lowest of the low...
and you shall look for him
in the clouds."
And the people cried,
"We shall look for him in the clouds indeed...
"for if the great are powerless
to save us from this tyrant...
how can one of no account avail?"
And the reader
of the Milky Way replied...
"Have faith, trust in Allah...
"for there, one day in the blue,
you shall see a boy...
"the lowest of the low, mounted upon a cloud.
"But the cloud shall be as strong as the hills beneath the snow...
"and from the ranges of the sky...
he shall destroy this tyrant
with the arrow ofjustice."
- What is the name of the tyrant?
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad.
I wish the miracle would happen today.
I wish he would die today.
Arrest him. Put him in prison.
When he says he's the king, tell them he's a madman.
His friends and all who might be loyal to him must be destroyed.
I learned that night not that men are evil, but that he was evil.
When he persuaded me among my people,
he laid a trap for me.
I was thrown into prison...
and there, in prison,
my life began... for there I met the one who was to become my only true friend -
Abu, the little thief of Bagdad.
For only very little thieves are thrown into prison.
No! No! Not in prison!
No! No! Not in prison!
- Don't put me in prison! No!
- Come in, thief.
Cut off his right arm, and then his left.
Then his left leg, then his right.
- And then his head.
- No! No! No! No!
I say no! No! Please, no!
Don't kill me!
- I don't want to die!
- Tomorrow morning.
And as for the madman, our great sultan Jaffar is merciful.
Only his head.
As the sun rises.
No! No, no!
- No! No, no!
Poor boy, they've driven you mad.
Me mad?
Theyjust said you were mad.
Are you really mad?
That's it. I'm mad. I must be mad.
The maddest of all the madmen that ever lived in the sultan's palace.
- You are mad, quite mad.
- What's it matter♪
In the morning, unless the sun stops still and never rises, we both die -
the thief and the madman-
and I don't want to die.
You are not mad... and maybe we shall watch the sun rise from over the river.
Didn't you hear the jailer?
"As the sun rises."
As the sun rises, we'll take a boat and go down to the sea.
I've never seen the sea... but I've heard the sailors on the riverside talk about it.
In the sea are fishes as big as the great temple... and little ones as tiny as my little finger, with wings.
And boats as big as Bagdad itself... with sails as big as clouds.
And when the wind blows, they go as fast as antelopes... and carry you to the isles of India and China.
To the isles of India and China.
And we're locked in prison.
The ax will fall as the sun rises.
And you say you're not mad.
- Look!
- What's that?
The key of the prison.
I just stole it.
- The key? Give it to me!
- Steady, steady.
You want someone to look after you.
We can't go now.
- Why not?
- We must wait. In an hour they will eat.
After they eat, they sleep.
Then we go.
Hurry! Catch this oar.
Give me that rope!
Hurry! We must get away.
Do you want us to be killed?
Do you think they will have mercy on us?
Don't you think if the king knew, he'd be merciful?
The king was a fool. I hope he suffers as much as he made the people suffer.
- Do you hate him so much?
- Everybody hated him.
Oh, if I could only lay my hands on him just once... if I could only tell him what a fool he was.
Tell it now.
I am Ahmad the king.
- Speak.
- Ahmad the king is dead.
He died yesterday.
There's a new king, Jaffar.
- Look!
Jaffar would not make all that fuss over me.
He would not send the whole guard after me.
Mercy, Master. I'm your slave.
Leave me at least one arm for small stealing, and I'll pay you twice as much in taxes.
- What's your name?
- I'm Abu the thief... son of Abu the thief, grandson of Abu the thief.
Most unfortunate of 10 sons
with a hunger that yawns day and night.
Get up, my little friend.
- We must return to Bagdad.
- How can you be such a fool?
I mean, my king would be killed.
A dead king and a dead thief cannot do much, you know.
If your fingers are as nimble as your brain, you are indeed the prince of thieves.
Come on. Let's catch the morning breeze.
That will carry us to freedom.
Freedom. Strange.
I've had everything but freedom.
And I've had nothing but freedom.
And now we've got it, what shall we do with it?
Anything we like.
In three days, we shall be in Basra.
Here. Take this pole. Push!

Abu! Basra!
Basra.
Basra. How beautiful it looks.
How beautiful it smells!
Pancakes!
- Give me one!
- Really, you are a fool.
Whoever heard of eating pancakes without honey?
But how can you steal honey?
Allah give us the pancakes, and he will provide honey.
- Honey! Honey!
- Ah.
Honey! Honey!
- You buy honey?
- Yes, we are thinking of buying some.
- Uh, a jar, of course.
- Jar?
- Uh, if it's good honey.
- The best in Basra.
Uh, easy to say. First I must try.
Ahh. I've tasted better.
What do you think?
- No. No, not good enough.
- No.
- Your bees are out ofhumor.
- Take better care of them.
Hey, old friend.
Whose palace is this?
Why, the palace of the sultan, children of ignorance.
- The palace of a thousand toys.
- Toys?
Where have you come from, you beggars of no importance?
Don't you know that the sultan has the greatest collection of toys in the world?
Why toys?
The sultan is an old man, and old men are like children.
He guards his toys more jealously... than he guards his daughter.
But I say no more. Now out of my way, you masters of a thousand fleas.
Allah be with you, but I doubt it.
- What's happening?
- Let me go!
- Not until you've told us.
- The princess comes!
- Then why does everybody go?
- It's death to look on her.
- Death?
- Why?
No man has ever seen her, nor shall, till her father gives her in marriage.
- Is she so ugly?
- Her beauty is like the sun and the moon.
Let me go!
- Let us go!
- Where?
Up there!
Ah.
- Your eating will cause our death.
- Without eating, we die.
Abu! Here they come!
- I must see her again.
- But I've found Sinbad the sailor.
And he has given us two places on his ship.
It is more wonderful than I'd ever imagined.
And on the next tide, she sails.
I can't go.
I must see her again.
But, Ahmad, all my life I dreamt of going in a great ship across the world.
I can't go.
I must see her again.
If I help you to see her, will you then come with me?
I will.
♪ O throbbing heart of mine♪
♪ Be still today♪
? We must await the word?
? That all men say?
♪ And when, O heart of mine♪
♪t comes to you♪
? Leap up?
? Remembering?
? It might?
? Be true?
♪t might be true?♪
No more. The music of a love song is as heavy as the noonday air.
Let us wait for the nightingale and the night.
To the pool.
Oh!
A djinni!
A djinni!
A djinni. Don't go! Don't go.
It's a djinni in the pool.
A djinni.
Are you afraid?
Yes. Terribly.
Why don't you run away♪
I want to look.
I've never seen a djinni before.
Well, then what do you see?
Remember always, to a djinni,
you must tell the truth.
You don't look wicked.
Are you a good djinni?
Not too good. Very good djinni are just as tiresome as very good men.
- Do you live down there?
- No.
- Why have you come?
- To see you.
- I was about to bathe.
- I'm waiting.
Bathe, with you there?
Give me your hand then.
Down into the water.
Oh, djinni, you've gone.
I didn't mean you to go so soon.
Shall I never see you again?
Never?
Don't be afraid.
I'm not a djinni.
Who are you?
Your slave.
Where have you come from?
From the other side of time... to find you.
How long have you been searching?
Since time began.
Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Till the end of time.
For me, there can be no more beauty in the world but yours.
For me, there can be no more pleasure in the world... than to please you.
Will you be here in the garden tomorrow at the same hour?
There's a gardener here who watches night and day.
His name is Death.
You mustn't come.
Forbid me then.
I cannot forbid.
Tomorrow!
And all tomorrows.
- Did you see her?
- I did.
Good! Then we can go with Sinbad tonight.
- No, Abu. I can't go.
- Why not? You have seen her again.
That's why I can't go - because I have seen her.
All right.
Then I'll go alone.
If you go there tomorrow again... how will you pass the guards without me to help?
- Oh, I'll find a way.
- You'll be caught.
You'll stay with me?
Oh, Abu, why should you?
You have as great a longing in your soul as I have.
- Why should you stay with me?
- Because I'm as great a fool as you are.
Brother of lions.
Fountain of hospitality.
You know, I have the largest collection of these mechanical devices... in the whole wide world.
And this is the most remarkable of them all.
I-It tells the time.
See how it works? Huh?
Sheer magic, isn't it?
I hope this dangerous device will never be allowed into the hands of the people.
- Dangerous?
- Yes.
If people once begin to know the time... they will no longer call you the king of time.
They will want to know how time is spent.
Oh, you're right.
Oh, the people must never know.
Look, look. Come.
Ah! See.
Such workmanship.
Such - Such precision.
Such reliability.
I do so prefer these things to my subjects.
Watch. Watch.
See. No, no.
That's the finest of them all.
See?
- I have only to wind a key or press a spring - and they do exactly the same thing every time... and exactly what I want.
And so often my subjects fail to do exactly what I want... and then I have to have their heads cut off.
See? Oh!
Your collection is indeed magnificent... and so near completion too.
Near completion? Huh.
I'd have you know my collection is-is the most complete completion.
Please, do not misunderstand me.
I am well aware that nothing short of a miracle could add luster... to this already dazzling display.
But such a miracle does exist.
A mechanical toy better than - than any of mine?
Knowing of your interest in these matters,
I have brought it with me.
Well, let's see it. Let's see it.
Quickly, quickly!
Oh, I can't bear to be kept waiting.
Ooh. This is exciting, this.
If Your Highness would wind it yourself.
Uh -
Oh! What's it going to do? Hmm?
Move its legs, or arch its neck?
Or- Or wag its tail? Hmm?
It doesn't kick, does it?
To tell you the truth, I'm always rather nervous of these things...
Till I know what they're going to do,
Till I get used to them.
Ooh. Ah.
It wants some winding.
- If Your Highness would mount.
- Yes.
- And now?
- Pull the reins!
Marvelous!
I am no longer a man. I am a bird!
I'm the king of birds!
Oh.
No! Oh. Mmm, I want it!
I want it. I must have it, and I'll give you anything you wish for it.
It's yours.
I ask but one thing in return.
Anything you will.
- Your daughter.
- My daughter♪
Mm-hmm.
Oh, dear, dear, dear. Really.
This is -This is very awkward.
Wh -What do you want my daughter for?
- I have to found a dynasty.
- Oh, quite, quite, quite.
I understand entirely about founding a dynasty.
Delightful thing to do.
I've tried myself, many times.
And what have I got?
A daughter.
The true offspring of the mother of miseries.
Her eyes have quarreled.
They're always trying to get at one another.
Her eyes are Babylonian eyes... and her eyebrows like the crescent moon of Ramadan.
- Her body's straight as the letter alif.
- How do you know?
- I've seen her.
- Oh, no, you -
- I have.
- Where?
- In my crystal.
- Oh, confound your crystal.
Confound all crystals.
I always did hate the things. I -
- Are you a magician?
- I have some skill.
Oh, say no more. I -
Anyhow, I - I must have this horse.
So I suppose you must have my daughter.
Mmm.
I will never marry him.
I would rather die.
I will go to my sister, who's married to he sultan of Samarkand.
She will protect me.
Go back to the garden. You will find someone there whom we thought was the djinni of the pool.
Tell him of our misfortune, and tell him that I will wait for him in Samarkand.
Yes, Princess.
Your Highness, the princess is nowhere to be found.
She is gone. We have searched
the whole garden.
- We have found only two beggars.
- Bring them here.
Jaffar! Jaffar!
Jaffar!
At last, face to face, man to man, sword to sword.
Give me a sword!
Allah will judge!
Great sultan, I speak the truth.
My eyes bear witness.
Ahmad!
My eyes!
I'm blind!
Ahmad!
Listen, great sultan,
I know the truth.
You must know who this man is!
And this - Listen, good people.
- Son of a dog.
- Allah.
By this, my magic rune... be what your fathers were... and bay the moon.
And this is my curse:
You shall remain a dog... and you shall walk in the darkness of the blind... until I hold her in my arms.
And now, dispensers of bounty, you know why a blind man with his dog... searches the world for a lost love, and with little enough hope.
Yet without that hope, there would be nothing.
And Allah is merciful.
Allah is merciful indeed, for the one that you seek is here.
If you mock me,
Allah will not forgive.
I do not mock. Your princess was captured by slave traders and sold here in our slave market.
The richest merchant in the town
bought her.
But no sooner was she taken to his house than she fell into the strangest trance.
She lives, but is as dead.
No doctor can restore her.
Night and day she calls upon the djinni of the pool.
- I was that djinni!
- And you alone can bring her back to life.
Can you take me where she is?
O djinni, shall I never see you again?
- Never?
- Lead me to her.
Why have you come?
To find you.
- How long have you been searching?
- From the beginning of time.
Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Till the end of time.
The dream - my dream - always the same dream.
This is no dream.
Ahmad!
Finish the masquerade.
Don't look at me like that.
Suffering has left its mark.
For me, your beauty will always be as I first saw it - never changing.
Your eyes -They're so strange.
So full of pain.
One cannot go through fire and not be scorched.
Ahmad, you must go.
The master has returned.
I will hide you, and when the master sleeps in the heat of the noon...
I'll bring her to you.
Quiet.
From now you're not only mine.
You belong to the princess as well.
Stay and guard her for me.
Blind. He's blind.
It is in your power to restore his sight.
There is, in this town, a famous doctor who would, at your request, cure him.
Take me.
Is the doctor here, on this ship?
Yes. He's waiting for you.
Open this door.
Open it!
Bring him nearer.
Nearer.
How do you find your dog's life, hmm?
Mmm. Strange how an unpleasant child can be a decent dog.
Throw him overboard.
Welcome.
- Jaffar!
- Yes.Jaffar.
It's always Jaffar.
Since you left your palace,
I have kept you safe.
When you rode hopeless and lost in the desert, who guided you?
When you were sold in the slave market,
who bought you♪
Always Jaffar.
It was in my house you were cared for, to sleep your sleep... and dream to its end... your first dream of love.
It was I who woke you.
No. It was Ahmad.
I was told there was a doctor here... who could restore his sight.
But I am that doctor.
The same moment that I hold you in my arms...
Ahmad will see.
Take me in your arms.
My eyes!
Hey! Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Can you see?
I'm Abu again!
Abu!
- Abu, where is she?
- She's with him -Jaffar- on the ship.
What good are my eyes to me without her?
Is there nothing for you without her?
Nothing.
No. No.
I have powers that could force you to my will.
But I want more than they can give.
I want your love.
Forget Ahmad.
He's no longer blind.
And for a man with eyes, the world is full of women.
Only I am cursed... that I can see only you.
Little fool. Trying to end your life before it has begun.
I tell you, Ahmad has forgotten.
Look!
It's Ahmad!
Wind!
Wind!
Wind!
Whip yourself, winds of heaven!
Whip till you wail aloud!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Why do you refuse to obey your destiny?
You behave like a slave girl.
I am a slave girl.
You could command me.
Try. Ask what you will.
Would you take me back to Basra?
- Helmsman!
- Master!
Northward to Basra.
This is a place of desolation.
It is the most beautiful garden in the world.
If there were ever flowers in it, they've vanished, like cancer.
And the pool - so dark with weeds... you can't even see your own reflection in it.
I'm not looking for my own reflection.
Father, I don't want to go to Bagdad with Jaffar.
- But, my dear-
- Don't let him take me.
- Don't!
- Oh, there, there, there, there, there, there.
Well, if you don't want to go to Bagdad with him, you shan't.
No. Never. Never, never, never.
Never while I live. There.
- There. Oh.
What is it?
The newest magical toy: the silver maid.
Does she do anything more?
She can embrace you.
But any of my wives will do that.
Her embrace will thrill you... as no other woman ever has... or ever will.
Do you mean I might get rid of all my wives... and have a collection of these things?
She tickles!
Guards!
Make ready for Bagdad.
Free! Free!
Free! Free! Free!
Free! Free! Free!
Free again!
Free, after 2,000 years!
2,000 years ago,
King Solomon, master of all the djinns... imprisoned me within that bottle.
For me, this is the first moment of my new freedom.
For you -
For you, this is the last moment of your life.
My life?
Your life!
In a moment I shall lift my foot and crush you... insect, beetle, worm that you are!
But, sheik of spirits,
Ifished you out of the sea.
I opened your bottle. I let you out.
You can't be so ungrateful.
Ungrateful?
Slaves are not grateful.
Not for their freedom.
Listen.
Inside my bottle for the first thousand years...
I swore that I'd enrich the one that freed me with all the riches of the earth.
But in the second thousand years, my imprisoned spirit turned to vengeance... on all that lived and were free.
And I swore that I'd kill him that freed me to satisfy that hate.
Are you ready?
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Please, before I die, may I -
May I ask one question?
Ask.
How comes it that you, as big as a mountain... could ever get into that bottle
I can hold in my hand?
You weren't ever in it really, were you?
- Of course I was.
- Oh, no, you weren't.
- I was!
- You weren't!
What? You dare doubt?
If I'm going to die in a moment, I can dare anything, and I say it's impossible.
- Impossible?
- And I don't believe you.
- Take care.
- And never shall.
- Never?
- Nothing can make me!
- Nothing?
- Nothing. Unless I see it with my own eyes.
Then, dog of an unbeliever, before you die... you shall see, with me, nothing is impossible!
You shall see and believe!
Now, you great, overblown belch!
Let me out! Let me out!
Just because you were bigger than me, you thought you could bully.
- Let me out! Let me out!
Product of inflation.
Descendant of a stink. Let you out?
I'm going to throw you back into the sea.
- This time forever.
- Oh, no. Mercy! Mercy, O Master!
- What's that?
- O great and merciful master!
- Say that again.
- O great and merciful master... let me out, and I'll grant you three wishes.
- Three wishes?
- Your first three wishes shall come true.
- You swear?
- I swear.
By King Solomon, master of all the djinn?
By King Solomon, the master of all the djinn... the oath that no spirit can break.
- And you'll behave? No threatening and shouting?
- No.
- No what?
- No, Master.
Now, don't make so much noise again.
You frightened me before.
Master, I hear and obey.
That's better.
All bullies must learn manners in the end.
I'm hungry.
Can't think with my stomach empty.
I wish I had some of those sausages
Mother used to make.
Your sausages, Master.
That was the first wish, Master.
Two more remain.
Name them.
Don't you hurry me.
I've got to be careful.
Two more.
You know what I wish?
Tell me. Where is my friend Ahmad?
Master, to know that, you must look into the All-Seeing Eye.
- Then give me the eye.
- Master, I can take you where it is... but not even I can steal it for you.
Steal? Huh!
I'll see to that.
- Little braggart. What have you ever stolen?
- What haven't I?
A key from its lock, ring from its finger, money from its purse, the strength of a djinni -
And the tongue of a liar!
But he who would steal the All-Seeing Eye... from the very brow of the goddess must be neither a thief nor a braggart, but a hero.
I always wanted to be a hero.
Come on!
Then catch on to my hair.
All right.
But mind you, this is not my second wish yet.
Now I'm rather helping you.
Yes, Master.
Djinni! Djinni!
I'm frightened!
I hear!
All right, Master?
I think so.
Where are we now?
Above the roof of the world.
Has the world got a roof?
Of course, supported by seven pillars.
And the seven pillars are set on the shoulders of a djinni whose strength is beyond thought.
And the djinni stands on an eagle... and the eagle on a bull, and the bull on a fish.
And the fish swims in the Sea of Eternity.
Where are we going?
On the highest peak of the highest mountain of the world... where earth meets the sky, and there is the Temple of the Dawn.
And in the great hall of the temple is the goddess of light.
And in the head of the goddess is the All-Seeing Eye.
And now, my little braggart... you can be a thief and a hero all in one.
A hero.

Djinni! Djinni! Help! Help!
Djinni, help!
Djinni!
Is this the All-Seeing Eye?
Not for 2,000 years will she grow another.
For a hundred generations of men, she will not know their doings.
- Now shall I know what happened to Ahmad?
- Look.
Look hard.
It's true. It's Ahmad.
Help!
Help!
Help!
- Help!
- Help!
Now my second wish.
Take me to him.
To hear is to obey, little master of the world.
Hold tight, little brother.
We have to return half across the world.
Don't be afraid, Ahmad!
- It's me, Abu!
- Abu!
Put me down!
Put me down!
Gently, you clumsy good-for-nothing!
- Abu!
- Ahmad!
Allah be merciful.
It's a real djinni.
Yes. He's mine, and I am his master.
I am your master, aren't I?
To hear is to obey, O Master!
See? He brought me here, and he'll carry us away.
What's he laughing like that for?
I don't like the sound of it.
Oh, he's all right.
He's a bit big to talk to.
That's the worse part about him.
You have to shout so much.
Hey, you up there!
- What are you laughing for?
- For my freedom. It is at hand.
You get us out of this place.
- Your third wish?
- No, no, no, no.
Not yet.
He is big, but he is sharp.
I've got to be careful.
Only one wish left.
I have only one wish.
Oh, I know all about that.
Your princess.
If only I could see her again.
Is that all?
I don't need to waste a wish for that.
- Look.
- What's that?
Look into it - hard, hard.
Keep staring into it.
You'll see her.
It's true!
A blue rose?
I've heard about that.
That -
That's the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness.
If she inhales its fragrance, she'll forget... everything.
Blue roses?
Exquisite.
Who are you?
I don't know.
I've forgotten.
Why have you suffered?
Have I suffered?
I don't remember.
It seems I was in love.
Whom did you love?
I cannot tell.
I don't know any longer.
I can't look anymore!
There are worse things than blindness.
Knowledge can be more terrible than ignorance, if one can do nothing.
Nothing.
Why did you give me this?
Take it back and break it into a thousand pieces.
I only stole it to help you.
You stole it because you enjoy stealing.
Without my stealing, you'd be dead.
I wish I were dead.
I wish I'd never seen you.
I wish -
I wish I were in Bagdad.
I wish you were!
Ahmad! Ahmad!
Ahmad! Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Where are you?
Where you wished him - on his way to Bagdad.
Then take me out of this place.
Don't you hear? I want to get out.
You stay where you are.
You're a clever little man, little master of the universe... but mortals are weak and frail.
If their stomach speaks, they forget their brain.
If their brain speaks, they forget their hearts.
And if their hearts speak-
If their hearts speak, they forget everything!
Am I not your master?
No longer.
You've had your three wishes, and I am free!
Free!
Djinni! Djinni!
Come back!
Don't leave me here!
Don't let me die! Djinni!
And farewell, little master of the universe.
Farewell! Free!
Free! Free!
Everything of the past is forgotten.
You have been in love with me.
You are in love with me.
You will always love me.
Everything of the past is forgotten.
I have been in love with you.
I am in love with you.
I shall always love you.
Hey!
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
Jaffar!
Ahmad.
Let's go!
Put them in prison.
Chain them to opposite walls.
In the morning, they die the death of a thousand cuts.
I have failed, my love.
Forgive me.
I have no regrets.
We are together.
And shall be for the rest of our lives.
We shall never again know the torture of being apart.
And if death is not the end, we shall go on together.
Abu and I parted quarreling.
I wish I could tell him I'm sorry.
Abu, my friend... good-bye and forgive me.
No. I won't say good-bye.
I'll help.
But how? How?
If I can't help, I won't see!
Welcome, our prince.
Welcome, little prince.
Father of a beard, there's some mistake.
I'm not a prince.
I'm only a thief.
For you we have been waiting twice 2,000 years.
Oh, no. Not waiting for me... because I didn't know I was coming, and I don't know how I've come.
Who are you, father of miracles?
And where am I?
This is the Land of Legend... where everything is possible when seen through the eyes of youth.
We are the remnant of the Golden Age.
Golden because gold was nothing.
No more than the sand beneath your feet...
or the stone that we became.
How did you become stone?
We were petrified with horror... by the evil done among men... when they ceased to be children... and to believe in the beauty of the impossible.
But whenever the heart of a child
returns to us...
and comes into us... we live again.
And so, as that child... you are to be my successor.
Now, come with me... and I will present you with two insignia... of true kingship.
Here they are.
Aim this only at injustice, and you cannot fail.
Oh, no, father of kindness.
I don't want it.
I don't want to be a king.
- I only want to save my friend.
- Well, this will help you.
Take it. And now...
I do homage... for you are king... and all in our kingdom is yours... except that carpet, which I keep for myself.
For on that carpet... which flies when it is bidden -
"Fly, carpet" -
I shall go to paradise
at the hour appointed.
It is told,
though Allah is wiser or more merciful...
there was in the past of the ages
a king among kings...
a master of arms and of armies,
of vessels and auxiliaries.
And this master of time and people
was an oppressor to both...
until the earth was as pitch
on the faces ofhis subjects and his slaves...
and they groaned together in secret...
and were slayed in the marketplace.
But a wise man
among the sages of Bagdad...
comforted them
with a prophecy, saying...
"In the fullness of time,
a liberator shall come upon you...
and this shall be the sign ofhim."
O Allah,
I know you don't much like stealing.
I'll never steal again.
You can trust me.
Just this once more.Just this little carpet so as to get to Bagdad in time.
When the old king's hour comes... he won't want a carpet to fly to paradise.
Then you, O Allah, will take him by the hand... gentle and kind as he is... and lead him into eternal bliss.
Aren't I right?
But I must go to Bagdad to save my friend.
It's a question of minutes.
You must see that.
O Allah, lord ofjustice,
let me steal.
Fly, carpet.
Wait.
Fly, carpet!
Why do you close your eyes?
There's little time left to see him.
The people cried,
"We shall look for him in the clouds indeed...
"for if the great are powerless
to save us from this tyrant...
how can one of no account avail?"
And the reader
of the Milky Way replied...
"Have faith, trust in Allah...
"for there, one day in the blue,
you shall see a boy...
"the lowest of the low,
mounted on a cloud...
"and that cloud shall be as strong
as the hills beneath the snow...
"and from the ranges of the sky...
he shall destroy this tyrant
with the arrow ofjustice."
The horse!
Up, quickly!
Ahmad!
Jaffar!
My people,
I owe everything to Abu... and when he grows into a man, he shall be my grand vizier.
He shall be sent to the best school in Bagdad... and all the wise men of the East shall teach him all the wisdom of the world.
He shall be the wisest of men,
and in those future days... when he will be full of knowledge, science and dignity... he will be the shining example for the youths of Bagdad... and they may remember how the little thief became the dignifi -
Hey! Abu! Where are you going?
You've got what you wanted.
Now, I'm going to find what I want.
- What's that?
- Some fun.
- An adventure at last!
In Europe, as the 17th century dawned...
... mankind was lifting itself
from ignorance and superstition.
The old frontiers of the mind
were rolling back.
New books, new methods
were aiding man...
... in his climb
toward knowledge and wisdom.
In the laboratory.
In the arts.
In every field of endeavor
man was lifting himself hand over hand...
... climbing onward, ever upward.
And on the outskirts of London
on a summer night...
... another man was lifting himself
hand over hand...
... climbing upward, ever onward...
... toward his objective.
- Catherine?
- Don Juan.
Oh, why have you kept me waiting?
I thought you'd never come.
See how my heart is pounding.
Beloved, no power on earth would have kept me from you.
In all this world, there's been but one image in my heart.
- One vision before my eyes.
- Yes, yes, go on.
I have loved you since the beginning of time.
But you only met me yesterday.
Why, that was when time began.
Don Juan.
My incomparable Don Juan.
Yes, yours and yours only.
I wish I could believe you.
But you've made love to so many women.
Catherine...
...an artist may paint a thousand canvases before achieving one work of art.
Would you deny a lover the same practice?
But how long will you love me?
Sweet lady, love is not measured in terms of time...
...only in ecstasy.
It's a beautiful night.
How bright the moon is shining.
Is there a moon?
It will be eclipsed when my husband returns.
Love like ours will never be eclipsed.
Your husband?
You said you were unmarried.
I said I was unattached.
And since I'm not attached to my husband,
I told you the truth.
But let's not speak of husbands.
- It's such a tedious subject.
- Yes, of course.
And there's really no need to worry.
He's on a hunting trip.
- He's extremely fond of grouse.
- Grouse, eh?
And besides...
...we have only these few moments.
A few moments? How few, loved one?
What is time?
A week, a day, an hour, a minute?
Time flies.
And he always blows his trumpet when he returns.
Catherine, look, got a grouse.
Got a...
Who is this?
You tell him.
Cecil, you didn't blow your trumpet.
Out of my way, mistress.
Speak up, you.
Sir, I realize that this must appear to be a trifle compromising.
- Compromising? En garde, sir.
- If you would allow me to explain...
I will allow you a decent burial and no more.
Will you draw your sword, sir, or shall I run you through?
That's not a very attractive offer.
However, you leave me no choice.
- Now what shall I do?
- Whatever you think best.
But can't you talk to him?
Touché.
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- I, ashamed?
Do you think it's fair to leave a beautiful woman like this alone, neglected...
...while you indulge your own selfish pleasures?
How true.
Grouse hunting?
- When did you last tell her she's beautiful?
- I don't have to, she's my wife.
Wrong. You should remind her of her beauty every day of her life.
Write her poetry. Send her flowers.
- And jewelry.
- Be quiet.
We should never close our eyes to beauty.
If you'd open yours, you'd have not only a wife, but a wife's love.
Sir...
...I give you back your...
Your grouse.
Be careful.
Thank you, but this has become more or less of a habit.
Guards! Guards!
Quickly! Guards!
- Leporello, quick.
- Guards!
- What now?
- Husband.
Horses.
After that man. There!
Over the wall! Hurry! Hurry!
Bring the scoundrel back dead or alive.
And now, mistress, I'll deal with you.
- Yes?
- I...
First, I must tend to my grouse.
- Halt!
- By who's command, fellow?
By command of Her Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth.
- This road is to be kept clear.
- For what reason?
To escort the Spanish duke...
...His Grace the Duke of Córdoba, along this road to London.
What next, you big lout?
How many times must I tell you how much I dislike pomp and ceremony?
- How many times?
- Yes.
- He doesn't like them.
- Your pardon. Are you...?
Merely a simple traveler, captain. No matter.
We'll find another road. Thank you.
If you wish, Your Grace...
- I mean... I mean, sir.
- What's that?
Oh, pay no attention to my fool of a servant, captain.
His brains are addled.
Your Grace, I don't think it fitting that you should ride into London alone.
- You must persuade His Grace.
- Forgive me, Your Grace.
We were told that the duke would arrive at dawn with a full retinue.
Oh, my retinue is close behind me, captain.
Indeed it is, Your Grace.
We'll take you to London instantly and to your bride.
- My bride?
- I know how impatient you must be.
On to London with all haste.
- Your Grace seems to be quite a celebrity.
- Quite.
So keep bowing. Keep smiling.
Imagine, being taken to one's bride by a royal escort.
They're not only royal, they're armed.
Keep bowing. Keep smiling.
I don't like it. I don't like it.
- Courage, Leporello. Courage.
- Courage?
I've gotta sit and wait and worry whether you're coming out headfirst...
...or just your head's coming out.
What are you complaining about?
I'm on my way to marry a woman.
I don't even know what she looks like.
Sit up straight.
No. No, no. I've decided. I won't do it.
I refuse to marry a man I've never seen.
But, Diana, it's all arranged.
It's been arranged for weeks.
The entire court has been invited.
Queen Elizabeth herself is coming to your wedding.
She can afford to.
She's not getting married.
This is treasonous.
What's come over you?
- You haven't been the same since France.
- I wish I'd never returned.
You're as stubborn as your mother, rest her soul.
This alliance may mean peace for England and Spain.
Yes, but not for me.
How do you know?
You've never even seen the duke.
- I have a premonition.
- But...
He's coming! He's coming!
The duke is almost here.
Oh, do come and have a look.
Have a look.
Diana, my child, for my sake.
For England.
Very well. I'll do it for England.
But if he looks like my premonition there still may be war with Spain.
Come, my lady, do have a look.
He's right below. Come along.
Oh, look, that must be His Grace there.
Oh, he's a fine looking gentleman, isn't it?
For a foreigner, that is.
Balcony, 18 feet above street level.
No trellises or vines to hang onto.
Flagpoles won't support your weight.
And if you come out suddenly, come over roof.
Keep horses close.
Well, my lady, what do you think of him?
- I know that head.
- But you couldn't.
- You've never seen the duke.
- No.
But I've seen that head.
Your Grace?
- Your Grace?
- Yes, My Grace.
My son.
My son.
- Father.
- Come.
Your bride awaits you.
Quick, my powder. My brush.
But a moment ago you didn't want to see His Grace.
- That was a moment ago.
- Oh, you're flushed and excited.
- Perhaps you should be put to bed.
- Perhaps.
- Come in, Your Grace. Come in.
- Thank you, sir.
- My daughter will greet you immediately.
- You're very kind, sir.
Diana, my dear.
Oh, Your Grace.
- There's something I should explain, sir.
- But... But...
Diana.
My daughter. My blessed child.
Here is your future husband.
Your Grace.
My compliments, sir.
Indeed, we're both fortunate.
I thank Your Grace.
I thank you.
- Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll...
- By all means.
Oh, Your Grace.
- Well, Your Grace?
- Extremely well.
- Now that I see you for the first time, I...
- The first time?
Well, beauty such as yours is always new.
Charming. Spoken like a Don Juan.
- Don Juan?
- Darling, let's stop pretending.
You're here at last.
- You've found me.
- So I have.
Just as you swore you would that star-crossed night...
...when you held me in your arms.
I'll never forget it.
It was...
- It was...
- Venice.
Venice. Yes, of course.
That unforgettable night.
You and I together.
Strange music coming to us across the water, haunting us.
It was Paris, you beast!
At the home of the Contesse de Trouville in the garden.
You swore you'd remember my kiss till the end of time.
That was four months ago.
Diana, darling, at last I found you.
Liar. Cheat. Imposter.
No. For a moment,
I was blinded by your beauty.
Why do you think I've risked my life to come here posing as the duke?
Well, why? You didn't remember me.
You'd forgotten all about me, hadn't you?
Hadn't you?
Well, call the guards.
Call your father. I deserve it.
This time you won't forget me.
This time I won't let you forget me.
Is that my heart beating so?
No, but that's your father at the door.
- Open the door!
- My lady. My lady.
That man's an imposter.
The duke is here with me.
Yes, father, I'm struggling with him, but he's so strong.
Diana, look...
You scoundrel! You shall pay for this with your head.
Dear lady, forgive me.
You'll come back?
I'm not sure I'll leave.
- Any suggestions, Your Grace?
- Not at the moment.
Have you any suggestions?
No back stairway? No...
Imposter!
Take your hands off my daughter!
Diana, this is the duke.
- This is your future husband.
- And who are you?
Merely a fellow countryman, sir.
Come to congratulate the bride.
- Your name?
- I'm Don Juan.
- Don Juan?
- Don Juan?
- Now, we are ruined.
- Allow me.
You're a disgrace to Spain.
And as a loyal Spaniard
I shall wipe out this disgrace.
- Oh, stop being so... So Spanish.
- Seize that man.
- Oh, let me kill him.
- No! No! No!
No! No! No!
- No! No!
- Diana.
Diana, my dear, no, no, no.
Thank heaven I arrived in time to save you.
But how I could have forgotten anyone as lovely as Diana...
...that's what worries me.
That worries you?
Merciful heavens. At this very moment, they may be sharpening the axes...
...or rigging their gallows, or perhaps both.
- And you're worried about your memory.
- Oh, my dear friend, what will be will be.
A few women I know I've forgotten.
Some I...
I don't even remember well enough to know whether I've forgotten them or not.
But Diana? And after only four months?
I must keep a diary.
Oh, I wouldn't start one now.
It would look ridiculous just to have one entry.
Women, thy name is trouble.
There must be something in life more important than the pursuit of women?
Yes, there must be. But what?
If you would only listen to me.
Here they are.
Don Juan de Maraña...
...you're paroled to the custody of the Spanish ambassador.
Come.
Leporello...
...my cape.
It was with the greatest difficulty...
...I was able to secure your release from an English jail.
But do not imagine this affair is concluded.
Now you seem headed for a Spanish prison.
The Duke de Córdoba has returned to Madrid and laid his grievances before the king.
It's not only an affront to Spanish dignity...
...it's a serious setback to me and my work.
I was able to achieve peace between England and Spain.
This marriage was a step in that direction.
I thought marriage was a step in the opposite direction.
Well, fortunately, there are those who disagree with you.
Queen Elizabeth was interested in this alliance.
Do you think it helps my cause for her to see it destroyed by a Spaniard?
- Perhaps if I talk to her...
- I forbid it.
Your reputation hardly qualifies you as a diplomat.
Yes, of course, my reputation.
Has it ever occurred to Your Excellency, that if a man...
...any average man, makes love to a girl, nobody thinks anything of it.
On the contrary, they all smile indulgently and say what a nice romantic fellow he is.
But if I so much as bow to a lady in the street...
...her relatives start reaching for daggers and wanna carve me up.
- Do you now pretend to be innocent?
- Well, for the things I haven't done, yes.
That still leaves you with a wide margin of guilt.
You were forced to leave St. Petersburg,
Amsterdam, Venice, Paris, Rome.
Columbus extended the world, but for you it grows continually smaller.
Now return to Madrid to present yourself at court for judgment.
- Not Spain...
- That's a command.
Well...
...at least I'll be buried in native soil.
Juan, your father was my friend.
For my sake and for the sake of his memory...
...why don't you give up this wasteful, useless life?
But, Your Excellency...
...I don't consider my life particularly wasteful or useless.
I'm just seeking happiness, the same as any other man.
Our viewpoints differ, that's all.
Yours seems to be higher than mine.
Possibly because you see life mostly from a balcony.
And yet I seem to have heard that when you were young...
We won't discuss that.
Juan, my son, you return to our country at a perilous time.
There are those in Spain as in England who would drive us to war.
Men like that are in every country.
But, unfortunately, those in Spain are shrewd and powerful.
Why, even the king's minister, the Duke de Lorca.
Well, at court, only the queen fights for peace.
Now, you have grace and wit and daring.
If you'd use these attributes in our cause...
Oh, Your Excellency, I'm not fitted for a life of court intrigue.
I wouldn't know what to do.
Besides, Her Majesty's hardly likely to seek my head.
- I'm returning in disgrace to be punished.
- As you deserve to be.
But you could be useful to us.
If one day I should call upon you, would you?
For you, my dear friend? Anything.
I've written to Queen Margaret urging she deal gently with you.
And, heaven forgive me, stating faith in your reformation.
If heaven will help, I'll try, if only to keep faith with you.
Do so. Her Majesty rewards those who serve her.
She gave me this ring as a seal of our friendship.
She needs friends.
Be loyal to her...
...and you'll find her as I have, a generous and just ruler.
- Thank you, sir.
- Remember your promise.
- I will. I'll set an example for all Spain.
- Heaven forbid.
- Adios.
- Adios.
Oh, don't you think I should make my apologies to Lady Diana?
Off with you!
What's happened here?
This is not the Madrid I once knew.
No life. No laughter.
That will all be changed now that you're back.
Thank you.
Couldn't we get something to eat?
Welcome, señores.
Welcome to the finest inn in all Madrid.
- How do you know it's the finest?
- Must be.
All the others have been taxed out of existence.
- May I be of service, señores?
- Indeed you may.
- Food and wine, if you please.
- This way, please.
The best in the house.
I must apologize, señores.
These days the best we have is only humble fare.
What? This from a man who's always served the best food in all Spain.
- In all Europe.
- Oh, thank you, señores.
My wife and I we shall do our best to please you.
Maria, we have guests.
You don't know this place.
A few lies can sometimes make a man feel happy.
Excuse me, señor, is there anything I can bring you?
Señorita, you've already brought me what I want.
Proof again that in all the world the most beautiful...
- No thanks.
- Michaela.
- I will serve the gentlemen.
- Yes, Mother.
Forgive me, señor, we mothers can't be too careful.
Don Juan is about to return to Madrid.
This fellow bring the black plague with him?
Worse than that, he brings himself.
You know his reputation.
- I shudder with fear.
- Oh, and I with anticipation.
Hussy! Get about your work.
Soup, señores.
Father, the Duke de Lorca's men.
A proclamation. Give heed.
"By order of the king's minister, the Duke de Lorca, we call on all men...
...with stout hearts and willing hands to join with us for the glory of Spain...
...in volunteering for service with the Spanish fleet.
Adventure and gold for all."
Any volunteers?
You, you will volunteer. Take him along.
- No, Father, no.
- No, he's my son. You have no right.
- Quiet, old man, or we'll take you too.
- You can't.
We are free men.
Take him out.
What is this disturbance?
Can't you see I'm having my meal?
You shall have a carving lesson to go with it, señor.
He's in there.
Señor! Señor!
Oh, bless you, señor.
- What happened?
- Oh, it was a press gang.
And they tried to take my son and me for the fleet. This gentleman saved us.
Oh, it is nothing.
Once in St. Petersburg, we were set up...
What are you boasting about?
You think it's a pleasure...
...to come home after 10 years and find myself in a brawl?
Your favor, good people. Now, perhaps, we can finish our meal in peace.
What...? What is your master's name so I may thank him properly?
Don Juan de Maraña.
- Don Juan?
- Did you hear?
Don Juan? Don Juan!
He's come back!
Michaela, what are you waiting for?
Serve Don Juan at once.
More wine, señor.
Please. You've had so many adventures.
Señores, señoritas.
These stories you've been hearing, they're mere legends. Old wives' tales.
We've only heard about young wives.
Is it true that you swam the Bosphorus to visit the caliph's daughter?
Certainly, my dear.
We'd sank the whole Turkish fleet on the way.
- Is it true?
- Why, of course, it's true.
It's all true.
But what we crave is news of Spain.
Yes, of our own country.
What of the court, for instance, and the new king and queen? What?
I thought we're among friends.
Well, señor, the queen works for the welfare of Spain.
- And the king?
- The king does not work at all.
Pacheco, how much longer must we straddle this contraption?
Yes, how much longer?
But, Your Majesty, I've just begun.
You have just begun.
But His Majesty has been straddling for years.
Be quiet, Sebastian.
If Your Majesty will be patient for just a few moments more.
- Oh, very well.
- Oh, very well.
- Your Majesty.
- Yes?
The Duke de Lorca seeks private audience with Your Majesty.
Oh, have him come in.
Diego, help Sebastian.
The things we do for posterity.
Yes, the things we do for posterity.
Sorry, Pacheco, affairs of state.
I understand, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Gentlemen, come in. Come in.
Lorca. Rodrigo.
Well, how do you like our portrait?
A perfect likeness, sire.
The artist has proven himself worthy of the subject.
- Hear that, Pacheco?
- It is high praise indeed, Your Majesty.
Yes, it is. It is.
We'll continue this another time.
Gentlemen, we wish to see the duke alone.
Run along, Sebastian.
Sire, be sure to lock up the paints and brushes.
- Why, monkey?
- Because His Grace is not in the picture.
And he'll try to rectify that.
He goes too far.
- One day, I shall send him further.
- Come, come, gentlemen.
He says even worse things about me.
Now, what do you want of us?
We have received news that the English queen...
...refuses to sign our treaty of peace.
- What's that?
She demands further guarantees and concessions.
- But we've already given her our word.
- Exactly.
She has seen fit to doubt the word of the king of Spain.
This is a serious matter.
What do you suggest?
What I have constantly suggested:
We prepare ourselves as they do.
Then strike first and strike suddenly.
- But isn't this rather drastic?
- Drastic, sire?
At this moment the English are building ships and arming them.
Suppose they attack first and we are defenseless, what then?
It does present a problem.
It's all very well to talk about war, but where's the money coming from?
I will see to that, Your Majesty.
With your help, of course.
There are taxes to be collected and levies to be imposed.
- This document will help solve the problem.
- What is it?
An order for the recall of our ambassador to England.
Recall de Polan? But on what grounds?
The New World is our colony, sire, and consequently...
...all profit from New World merchandise should be ours too.
Instead, it is being paid to the count and held by him.
- By who's authority?
- By yours, sire.
The queen persuaded you to sign a paper to that effect.
Someone's always getting me to sign papers.
- I'll not do it anymore.
- It'll be to your advantage to sign this one.
- But I can't. De Polan is our friend.
- The queen's friend, sire.
Well, why not write him and ask him for the money?
He refuses to turn it over to us.
He and the queen are using it to promote trade between England and Spain.
Sire, with this money we could build a great and invulnerable navy. An armada.
Yes, but the last time we built an armada, the confounded English sank it.
Last time, every Englishman from the chimney sweep...
...to Sir Francis Drake knew our armada and were prepared.
This time we'll build in secret.
Even the queen need know nothing of this until de Polan turns the money over.
- Yes, but...
- Sire, without ships we are powerless.
A second-rate nation.
But with ships...
...our arms will sweep over England,
Africa, Eurasia...
...over the New World and thence to Cathay and the East Indies.
This is the destiny of Spain.
Your destiny.
To carve out an empire and be proclaimed an emperor greater even than Charlemagne.
Charlemagne?
Yes. Yes.
In years to come your people will bless you for this.
Well, here's for the people.
Her Majesty, Queen Margaret.
Your Majesty.
How now, Margaret?
Your Majesty granted several audiences.
They await us.
Oh, audiences are such a bore.
Always people wanting something.
They're not important to you but they've been promised.
But I'll have to go through all that discomfort.
And I've had a very difficult morning.
Oh, you haven't commented on my portrait.
- Most regal, sire. Truly a king.
- Everyone seems to think so.
I'll have Pacheco make a copy for you.
A smaller one to put in your apartment.
I will cherish it. Perhaps it may reveal some of the secrets you keep from me.
- We have no secrets, have we, Lorca?
- Our policy is an open book, Your Majesty.
Written by Your Grace and dedicated to war.
Your Majesty mistakes my motives.
You've come but recently from your father's court in Austria...
...and cannot therefore understand as we do the problems of Spain.
I was under the impression that the desire to make people happy knew no boundaries.
There, there, my dear.
You mustn't worry about such matters.
Besides, the audiences are waiting.
If you will proceed, we will join you as soon as we can.
As you say, sire.
Odd, isn't it, Lorca...
...that Her Majesty always makes me feel as though I was Sebastian's size?
Now, I don't feel that way with you.
Señor, I'm ordered to present myself before Their Majesties.
Don Juan de Maraña.
Escort this gentleman to the antechamber of the throne room...
...and submit this letter to Her Majesty.
Don Juan de Maraña?
This way, please.
Don Juan de Maraña.
Your Majesty.
You may rise, señor.
No man has ever approached this throne with such advance notice.
We have received letters concerning you from our ambassadors all over Europe.
It is with slight regard...
...and very little favor that your queen receives you on your return to Spain.
You come back to us notorious, of ill repute...
...disgraced in your own country and abroad.
You are no credit to this crown or to our flag.
Have you nothing to say?
There seems to be very little left to say,
Your Majesty.
You are quite right.
Do you realize that you destroyed our plans for an important marriage of state?
That marriage, Your Majesty, was doomed from the beginning.
Those two didn't even know each other, let alone love each other.
Business arrangements can be made that way, but love...
Your views on love are quite well-known, señor.
We are not interested.
However, the Count de Polan seems to have faith in your promises of reformation.
He must have reasons for pleading so poor a cause.
Perhaps you can enlighten us?
I thought myself the count was inclined to be overoptimistic, Your Majesty.
Being an old family friend...
...he seems to find qualities in me that may not exist.
However,
I'd sincerely like to justify his faith.
Perhaps even gain yours.
Our faith is gained by deeds not by words.
His Majesty, the king.
Well, well. And whom have we here?
This is Don Juan de Maraña,
Your Majesty.
Don Juan, huh? Bad boy.
So this is the great Don Juan.
Not knowing who you are, señor,
I'm unable to return the compliment.
Oh, this is our minister, the Duke de Lorca.
- Yes. I've heard much of Your Grace.
- And I of you.
Tell me, do you hire men to spread the tales of your romantic conquests?
No, Your Excellency, that's a service...
...that's always been done for me free of charge.
You have a ready tongue. It's a pity it's been used in such idle pursuits.
A matter of opinion, Your Grace.
Some men prefer the conquest of beauty to the conquest of a throne.
You may proceed, Margaret.
Our ambassadors asked us to find service for Don Juan at our court.
If it pleases, Your Majesty.
Yes. Yes, why not?
For what work are you qualified?
Work, Your Majesty?
That's a problem that's often troubled me.
Let's see.
I have a small knowledge of history...
...and a little skill with the sword.
Perhaps I may even lead a press gang...
...such as I interrupted yesterday on its royal errand.
You will explain your statement.
When I arrived in Madrid...
...my first encounter was with a detachment of the Duke de Lorca's men.
They were abducting by force...
...Your Majesty's subjects for service in the Royal Navy.
Well, there must be some mistake.
Do you know anything about this, Lorca?
The whole matter is easily explained,
Your Majesty.
This Don Juan returns to Spain in disgrace...
...to hear the crown's sentence for his conduct abroad.
What could be easier than to distract with a story of press gangs?
Yes. Yes, that must be it.
I assure Your Majesty the affair took place as I described it.
I will tell you what took place.
Some affair was reported to me.
A brawl with a drunken sergeant for the affection of an innkeeper's daughter.
The sergeant is reflecting on a diet of bread and water.
Your Majesty should consider the merits of the sentence for the other party involved.
And now, have I Your Majesty's permission to withdraw?
There are more important matters to consider...
...than the settlement of a drunken brawl.
I must go too.
Pacheco's waiting.
He has to fill in my head.
Your Majesty, much has been said of me.
A great deal of it true.
Even my enemies know
I'd not invent any such lie...
...merely to evade the consequences of my actions.
I shall investigate this affair.
In the meantime, there's a question of suitable service for you.
- I'm yours to command, Your Majesty.
- Very well.
You will become fencing instructor at the Royal Academy.
And confine your instruction to this alone.
You will report to the master-at-arms,
Don Serafino Lopez.
That is our command.
It will be obeyed, Your Majesty.
And may I add my own humble thanks for your generosity.
You may go now, señor.
- Your Grace.
- Come in, Rodrigo. Come in.
The Count de Polan crossed the frontier into Spain this morning.
He drives on to Madrid.
- Alone?
- He has attendants. A handful.
Hardly a sufficient escort for such a notable visitor.
A larger party has been dispatched under Capitán Alvarez.
Splendid. We must see that the Count de Polan receives every courtesy.
- Capitán Alvarez has his orders, Your Grace.
- Good.
Remember, every courtesy.
Yes, Your Grace.
Capitán Alvarez.
On to the fortress!
You must forgive my haste in bringing you back, my dear count.
But it was most urgent.
The urgency of your personal ambition.
You put it bluntly but with a certain degree of accuracy.
Fortunately, my ambition coincides with that of Spain...
...for a Spanish empire.
To be built out of the suffering of our people and to be ruled by you.
The building of an empire entails certain sacrifices.
As for me, I have no desire to sit upon a throne.
- I much prefer to stand behind it.
- With a dagger in your hand.
No, I dislike violence.
I find persuasion far more effective.
And now, if I can persuade you to answer one question...?
You may ask it.
A purely material consideration.
A matter of several millions paid into your hand.
If you tell me where you've concealed this money...
It will be turned over to Spain at the proper time.
For the purpose of this transaction,
I am Spain.
I prefer to deal with Her Majesty not with a traitor.
My dear friend, I'm afraid your long stay in a country ruled by a king in petticoats...
...has made you a feminist.
- When Her Majesty hears...
It may interest you that the palace guards are loyal to me and not to the queen.
I have arranged this so that if Her Majesty interferes with my plans again...
Or rather, with the plans of Spain.
- She will suffer the consequences.
Now will you answer my question?
As you can see we have several interesting devices in this chamber.
They have a tendency to break a man's will.
If the first one fails, we try another...
...until we find exactly the right one to loosen the tongue.
I have heard of men whose tongues have withstood it.
Yes, but they now speak with the tongues of angels.
You're tired after your long trip.
Perhaps a few days' rest will make you more amenable.
If not, well...
Capitán Alvarez, the count will remain here as our guest.
See to it that he is not disturbed by anyone.
And now, my dear count...
...may I wish you good night and pleasant dreams.
If you change your mind, send for me.
What's this?
- Very nice.
- No. No.
That's a gift from Her Majesty.
It will look better on me than on a corpse.
Very nice.
- Excuse me.
- That's the second time.
That's enough. Give me that.
You think I want my throat cut?
Sorry. I seem to be a bit nervous.
These regular hours we're keeping.
Hard work, lots of sleep, plenty of exercise...
...good nourishing food and no excitement.
We're not used to these things.
Yes, but that's the only way of life for me.
But you'll have to admit that they were exciting days.
- And nights.
- Exciting?
That's very funny coming from you.
Remember those lectures you used to give me?
Well, I'm afraid I'm a bit confused.
The sudden way in which you reformed...
...one reception at court.
The court didn't do it.
Well, I thought maybe the queen...
The queen?
What's the queen got to do with it?
You've been thinking behind my back.
Because I'm trying to lead a good clean sensible life...
...you immediately jump to conclusions.
Just let me tell you this.
Whatever my behavior has been or it's gonna be...
...the queen has nothing to do with it.
Absolutely nothing. Do you understand?
All right.
- Splendid. Splendid.
- Splendid. Splendid.
Half turn right. Forward march.
You may rise, gentlemen.
- A splendid exhibition, Don Serafino.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
They show remarkable improvement.
We are deeply gratified.
Your Majesty's most kind.
But may I share the credit with Don Juan?
Since he had joined us...
...the interest in swordsmanship has increased enormously.
We trust he will not add any other subjects to increase the interest.
May I inquire if Her Majesty is also satisfied?
We are indeed.
You apparently studied all the foreign techniques of swordsmanship.
I've had occasion to use them,
Your Grace.
I have not met such skilled an opponent...
...since I have the honor of fencing with the Duke de Lorca himself.
That is indeed a compliment.
We consider Lorca the best living fencer in Spain.
That's certainly the mark of a good duelist,
Your Majesty, to be living.
I wish I knew how to duel.
Whom would you choose for your opponent?
A mouse. Caterpillar.
Or perhaps His Grace.
I'd considered it an honor to teach you, sir.
- You will?
- Certainly.
- Go and get equipped for tomorrow's class.
- Oh, thank you.
I'll go at once.
- Do you really think I can learn?
- Why not? Of course, you can.
That was very kind of you.
You've made a friend.
I can use friends, Your Majesty.
You show such interest in the academy.
Perhaps you'd like to inspect it thoroughly?
Don Juan, would you escort Her Majesty?
Indeed, sire. An honor.
You know, Lorca, we might find a use for this Don Juan.
Yes, sir, Your Majesty.
My own thoughts were along similar lines.
This, Your Majesty, is our trophy room.
Here, you see some of the personal flags...
...of such conquerors as Cortéz,
Columbus, Pizarro.
Over there are some of the flags taken from Your Majesty's enemies in battle.
Oran, Tripoli.
And that empty space awaits new conquests by Your Majesties.
Unless it can be filled with the trophies of peace...
...I would rather it remained empty.
I knew you'd say that.
Oh, the Count de Polan...
...he's told me something of your feelings.
- Have you heard from him recently?
- No, I haven't.
Nor have I. It is strange that he should keep silent so long.
Yes. He was far from silent at our last meeting.
I can well believe that.
However, I shall write and tell him how you have changed.
- I know he'd be pleased. As I am.
- I'm very grateful.
Now, perhaps I can forget those words you once spoke to me:
"You're no credit to this crown or to our flag."
Did I say that?
That was just a small part.
Would you care to hear the rest?
No. I give you permission to forget all of it.
I know this flag.
When I was a child in Austria...
...my mother used to tell me the story of Ponce de León...
...and his quest for the Fountain of Youth.
Thank heavens he never found it.
Wouldn't you like to retain your youth?
What? And repeat all my indiscretions?
I think you paint yourself far blacker than you are.
It's the color that's said to suit me best.
- I don't believe that.
- Thank you.
I shall try to prove myself worthy of your disbelief.
Perhaps you will.
Your Majesty.
The Count de Polan asked me to be loyal to you.
To try to win your friendship.
And will you be loyal?
With all my heart.
Then I shall be your friend.
I...
I mustn't keep His Majesty waiting.
I'm summoned to appear before the Duke de Lorca.
Oh, yes.
Don Juan de Maraña to see the Duke de Lorca.
Don Juan de Maraña.
Ask him to come in.
Don Juan.
Your Grace.
- You sent for me, I believe.
- Yes.
Yes, a matter of some importance
I wish to discuss with you.
Now, won't you be seated?
I was greatly pleased by the exhibition yesterday.
So pleased, in fact, that I feel you should be rewarded.
I've prepared a commission, which will give you considerable rank in His Majesty's navy.
It also assures you of the king's favor and my own.
Somehow I feel that Your Grace is not in the habit of dispensing favors...
...without expecting something in return.
You are quite right. Yes.
You have achieved some popularity since you have been at the academy.
And I think we should utilize this in the service of our country.
Consequently, I have certain ideas that I should like you to carry out.
- May I hear them?
- You may indeed.
Proceed to enlarge the academy.
Increase the number of young men of military age and add those subjects...
...which will qualify them for immediate enlistment in His Majesty's navy.
We will discuss the details later.
In the meantime, here is your commission.
Incidentally, I was very impressed by your general technique yesterday.
Very good.
Very good, yes.
It was quite good.
Well?
It seems to me
Your Grace is preparing for war.
- Does the idea frighten you?
- Frankly, it does.
I'm by nature a peaceful man,
Your Grace.
It's true I've done some fighting in my time...
...but it's usually for something worthwhile...
...like a beautiful woman.
To risk your skin for a piece of extra ground, that's terrifying.
I take it then you do not look with favor upon my proposals?
That, Your Grace, is an understatement.
In my opinion, your personal ambitions...
...can only lead our country to complete disaster.
I wasn't aware that I asked for your opinion.
May I remind you, my dear fellow, that in a conflict, one must choose a side.
The middle ground is frequently the most dangerous.
I've been in the middle so many times,
Your Grace, it doesn't disturb me.
I see you prefer to be witty rather than wise.
Not at all.
I prefer to be on the side of the friends of Spain, not her enemies.
Next time, I may cut deeper.
Next time...
Next time, I'll wear my old clothes.
Your Excellency.
- What's happened, Your Grace?
- Never mind, give me that.
- What news of the Count de Polan?
- He still refuses to speak.
Very well.
We shall wait no longer.
Take him to the torture chamber.
Yes, Your Grace.
We are pleased to have you with us,
Count D'Orsini.
We hope to see more of you and your bride before your return to Italy.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
And I'm sure that the people of my country will welcome this alliance.
And now, we must not keep you any longer.
You are very kind, Your Majesty.
And I am deeply grateful for this reception.
Your Majesty, I had a difficult time getting him here.
I had to force him.
- You may leave us, Sebastian.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Would you care to take a walk with me in the garden?
With Your Majesty's permission.
I believe congratulations are in order,
Don Juan.
A royal commission is a great honor.
You should be very proud.
I suppose I should, Your Majesty.
But I rejected the commission.
I don't understand.
It would have meant so much to you.
Yes, I suppose so.
But I've always looked upon the academy as a school for the art of defense.
- Not aggression.
- Oh, I agree.
- I heard of the Duke's plan last evening.
- Surely not from him?
The palace has large keyholes.
My informer has small ears.
I detest this intrigue, but Lorca has his spies so I must have mine.
Spies are not enough, Your Majesty.
I assure you, you need constant protection.
Someone you can trust who will watch over you.
Don't you think you make too much of my danger?
Well, when it concerns
Your Majesty's welfare...
...perhaps I am overcautious.
May I suggest you be equally cautious concerning yourself?
If you have made an enemy of the Duke, that is unwise.
Yes, I'm well aware of that, Your Majesty.
As a matter of fact, it's already cost me my best jacket.
Hot-tempered, isn't he?
However, I'll make friends and choose enemies to please myself...
...not the Duke de Lorca.
I wish there were more men in Spain with the courage to defy His Grace.
I'm glad you came back.
So am I.
Look.
These materials have just arrived from Holland.
- Aren't they lovely?
- Beautiful.
- You've been to Holland, haven't you?
- Briefly.
I always wanted to travel. I envy you.
Tell me, Don Juan, don't you miss the life you once led?
Well, I meant it must have been so interesting.
And you have changed so completely.
Yes, it's been quite a surprise to me too,
Your Majesty.
Perhaps it's because
I found something I always wanted.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
A purpose in life, your work.
My work's quite congenial, but hardly that inspiring.
What is it then? Please be seated.
Tell me.
Shall I command you?
- If you command me, then I must obey.
- I do command you.
It's not easy to tell.
Like most other men...
...there's always been an imaginary woman in my life.
I endowed her with all the virtues.
I clothed her in perfection.
Naturally, I searched for her in vain.
I thought she could never exist except in my mind.
Now I find she does.
Who is this woman?
You choose to keep her a secret?
Only because she doesn't know how deeply I care for her.
Well, you never hesitate to express your love to other women.
She's not like other women.
Well-spoken.
- What is she like?
- Beautiful.
But strangely unaware of her beauty.
Passionate, too, but without any real knowledge of passion.
Unafraid of love because
I don't think she's ever known love.
But she's taught me virtue and dignity and wisdom.
You seem to have chosen a paragon among women.
Among women and among queens.
Have you forgotten to whom you are speaking?
No. Some men shut their eyes and dream, others open their eyes and hope.
All my life I have been stumbling around as if in darkness. I am no longer.
Silence.
You have no right to speak to me that way.
I forbid you.
I would never have spoken except by your command.
Then I was wrong to command you.
Wrong to think that you could ever reform...
...or to believe that friendship and loyalty could replace your desire for conquest.
- That's not true.
- You may go, señor.
Yes, Your Majesty.
So? Don Juan?
Again.
- Correct?
- Excellent.
Now me.
Arm extended.
- What was that?
- My new side step.
Let me see it.
Don't ever sidestep the wrong way.
Continue.
No, no, no. What are you trying to do, club the man to death?
This, my friend, is a rapier, not an axe.
Now, watch.
All right, en garde.
Now, beat, extend and lunge.
Thus, you see?
Isn't he charming?
Serafino, can nothing be done about these gaping, ogling visitors?
Of course, in the past nobody came but an occasional old soldier. Now...
Now we have a whole flock of chattering females.
Look at them up there, looks like a hen roost.
Yes, this feminine interest is surprising.
Personally, I've had enough feminine interest for the day.
If you don't mind.
That will be all. Class dismissed.
Really.
Juan, what is the matter with you today?
Why, nothing. Nothing at all.
It's just a little ironic.
A man gives up everything. A rich, full life.
First time he tries to be sincere, what happens?
- Exactly what I'm trying to find out.
- Well, mind your own business. You too.
Excuse me, señor.
Has my brother finished with his lesson?
- Your brother, señorita?
- Yes.
Do you happen to recall his name?
- Of course, Carlos.
- Carlos?
Everyone is finished, señorita, so no doubt Carlos is finished too.
Oh, I didn't understand.
- I call for him every day.
- Yes, I know.
Well, I don't like to have him walk home alone.
He's so young and helpless.
Well, that's very sisterly of you.
Besides, it's quite a distance from here.
All the way to the Plaza Madrid.
The Plaza Madrid?
- The last house.
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, on the right.
- Oh, on the right?
Elena.
Are you here again?
- Carlos, run along, dear.
- Bye, Don Juan.
Good day, señor.
- Señorita, your fan.
- Oh, yes.
You will return it to me, won't you?
Getting warm.
It will get warmer.
Listen.
Every evening that nightingale sings here.
- How sad and sweet his song is.
- Yes.
And my heart sings with him sweetly because you're by my side.
And my heart is very sad, for soon you must go.
- And tomorrow...
- Tomorrow?
Tomorrow, I shall fence very badly...
...because my eyes will be drawn to the platform where you are.
No, I won't be there tomorrow.
- Oh, you won't?
- No, I'll never be there again.
- Oh, my darling, we'll be together all the...
- No, I'm getting married tomorrow.
You must think it capricious of me to be with you the night before my wedding.
- Capri...? No, no, not at all, not at all.
- You don't?
Well, perhaps...
Perhaps just the least little bit.
I did it so I could remember for all the years of my life...
...this evening here in the garden with Don Juan.
Well, I'm delighted to have been of service.
I don't want to marry Count D'Orsini.
- The Queen arranged it.
- The Queen?
Yes, she did it to strengthen the alliance between Spain and his country.
History repeats itself.
Oh, nothing.
That's why we must never see each other again.
Never.
Never, never.
I know you'll forgive my hasty departure.
Prolonged sentimental farewells are too painful.
Good night, beloved. No, no, no, don't.
I want to remember you just as you are.
No, no, it's easier this way, farewell.
- Good evening, señor.
- Evening.
Count D'Orsini.
Well, good evening.
You'll not get away so easily, señor.
You're caught.
The story of my life.
Señor, this may possibly sound a little trite, but I can explain everything.
I happen to be the fencing instructor of the Countess Elena's brother and...
Would you believe I came here to give him a lesson?
- At this hour?
- What time is it?
Well, you know what they say, never too late to learn.
He's telling you the truth.
If it is the truth, then he should be prepared to die for it.
Come, Señor Fencing Instructor.
You'll give me a lesson. En garde.
My dear count, can't we possibly settle this some other way?
I'm warning you, señor, draw your blade.
Would you be satisfied with an apology?
My dear count, we have no argument.
The lady is yours.
Their Majesties shall hear of this.
It is shocking. Unbelievable.
Once again, he's provoked a serious scandal and disrupted an important alliance.
The very same sort of conduct...
...which brought him back to Spain in disgrace.
It is disillusioning, Your Majesty.
This time I will know how to deal with him.
He shall be punished, and most severely.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, but surely you intend to give him a chance to explain?
- There's no explanation possible.
- But perhaps it wasn't his fault.
I mean, I was at the academy yesterday afternoon...
...and I saw certain things.
- What things? What are you talking about?
- Something was disturbing Don Juan.
- He was irritable and upset and...
- Yes, well?
Well, he certainly wasn't interested in any of the young ladies present.
- But the Countess Elena began to...
- Well, go on.
Well, she began to make advances.
- You know, she's young and charming...
- Well, what happened?
Well, I do not wish to malign the countess, but she practically...
Well, you know, a man has just so much control.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Is this true? Are you lying to protect him?
Your Majesty...
Margaret, we have just heard about your friend Don Juan...
...and we're most distressed.
- I understand, sire.
Our court is not to become a playground for wastrels.
Nor will we allow our guests to be humiliated by any of our subjects.
We have decided once and for all to be rid of this fellow.
He is to leave Spain and never return.
Yes, but, sire, to be banned forever, that's worse than a sentence of death.
That, too, was considered, Your Majesty.
But to kill Don Juan would make a martyr of him...
...and we would not care to enhance his already legendary reputation.
- Sire, I beg you to reconsider.
- The matter is closed.
We have ordered Don Juan put on the first ship bound for the New World.
That is our judgment.
- Your Majesties.
- Well, well?
Your Majesty, Don Juan has disappeared.
We can find no trace of him anywhere.
You blundering idiots.
Warn the guards at the city gates.
Search every house and street in Madrid until you find him.
With Your Majesty's permission, of course.
Yes, yes, by all means find him.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Thank you, señor.
- All arrangements made?
- Yes, but to what purpose?
We'll never get out of Spain alive.
The roads are watched, frontier guarded.
This inn is filled with soldiers hunting for you.
Let them look.
Señor, Lorca's men are everywhere.
I pray you'll be careful.
- Oh, you may as well argue with a stone.
- The wagon will be ready soon.
- It will take you to the frontier.
- Innkeeper.
- Innkeeper.
- Watch yourself.
Innkeeper.
- Yes, capitán?
- Innkeeper, I need money and more wine.
- Sell you this ring cheap. A bargain.
- It's not necessary, capitán.
If you will come with me...
- Perhaps you will buy this ring, señor?
- No, capitán.
- Only a few ducats.
- Capitán, please.
And what about you, señor?
It's beautiful.
- Thank you, no.
- Please...
Genuine heirloom.
See the workmanship, eh?
- Please, capitán, come with me.
- And cheap.
Michaela, more wine for our friend.
Juan, I beg you to consider.
- It's madness to try and escape.
- It's madness to stay.
I must leave Spain.
Very well, we'll go.
No. Not you.
I'd not ask you to share with me what lies ahead.
I go alone.
Do you think I'd let you go roaming about the universe without me?
- I'm going with you.
- And if I order you to stay?
Then I shall disobey.
Everything is ready, señor.
Be on guard.
There will be trouble awaiting you.
I'm accustomed to trouble.
Fortunately, I'm a coward.
That will balance the situation.
Thank you.
See the stones, the workmanship.
- Would you gentlemen care to buy a ring?
- Not interested.
Not interested, huh?
Well, you're the loser. It's beautiful ring.
Marvelous workmanship. It's magnificent.
- What is it? What is it?
- That ring.
- It belongs to the Count de Polan.
- But the count's in England.
Go in and ask the captain if he'd be kind enough to have a word with me.
- Excuse me, capitán?
- Well, what is it?
My friend is interested in your ring.
- Would you mind stepping outside?
- Very well.
- Well, where is he?
- Please.
- Very valuable ring.
- Very.
I wonder, captain...
...if you'd be kind enough to tell me how you came by this ring?
- I don't remember.
- Oh, you don't?
Perhaps a little wind in your gullet might refresh your memory.
- Speak up.
- Took it from a prisoner in the fortress.
- The Count de Polan, wasn't it?
- No.
The truth, or on my soul I'll drive this steel right through your neck.
- Speak up.
- Yeah, it was the count.
How came he there? By whose order?
The Duke de Lorca.
This is the final insult.
The Count D'Orsini has left Madrid.
Our relations with a friendly government have been impaired.
And Don Juan has disappeared.
Completely vanished.
- Is there no sign of him?
- None.
But don't worry, frontier guards have been alerted.
And this time we'll have his head.
This time...
Your Majesty.
- Well, what is it?
- Don Juan de Maraña is here.
He begs audience with Her Majesty.
- Don Juan?
- Yes, sire. He has surrendered.
But he says it's most urgent that he speak with Her Majesty.
Send him in.
Your Majesties.
- Don Juan.
- You may approach, señor.
Well, what do you want of us?
I bare grave tidings, Your Majesties.
- What happened, Rodrigo?
- Don Juan's in the palace.
- He's found out about the Count de Polan.
- What?
- Phillip?
- But Lorca wouldn't do such thing...
...without our consent. I mean...
- Your Majesty...
...this, I think, should be sufficient proof.
Yes, it is true.
This is a ring I once gave him.
We must go to the fortress at once.
But, my dear, we mustn't be so hasty.
Your Majesties, I beg you not to delay.
I fear for the count's life.
He's right. Phillip, please.
Oh, very well.
There's no need for all this.
Lorca, you're the very one we wanted to speak to.
Seize that man.
If he resists, put an end to him.
Stop this. Stop this at once.
Put up your swords.
What is the meaning of this?
- Take him to the fortress.
- Just a moment.
- When do you give orders in our presence?
- We live in a changing world, sire.
Even as we stand here, the command of the palace shifts from Your Majesty to me.
As for you, Don Juan...
...your sentence of exile will be changed to a sentence of death.
- This is treason.
- You will never succeed in this.
The people will rise against you.
Shepherds may change, but sheep remain sheep.
And now, Your Majesty,
I must ask you to retire.
I have private business
I wish to transact with the king.
Escort Her Majesty to her apartment.
And see that she's well protected against any intrusion.
- And now, sire.
- What do you intend doing with us?
Your Majesty will continue to rule with certain guidance and direction...
...and without the interference of the queen.
- You will not harm her?
- Not if it can be avoided.
I will give her her choice.
Either the position of an obedient wife, or the fate of a meddling woman.
And now, if you'll excuse me...
Your Majesty.
All right, open.
Yes, capitán.
Well, well, my friend, how things change.
I trust you're comfortable?
What's the matter, can't you speak?
You were quite talkative last night.
So were you, with a blade at your throat.
I hope you retain your sense of humor when there's a rope around yours.
Oh, incidentally, you were curious about the Count de Polan.
Oh, mercy...
Your Excellency?
Don Jose?
It's me.
Don Juan, Juan. Juan de Maraña.
Don Juan?
Speak up, old man.
Or do you need more persuasion?
Don't. No.
- In which cell is Don Juan?
- What do you wish of him, Padre?
We have come to give him the last rites.
Juan?
Don Juan?
Juan.
Don Juan.
Count Seraf...?
Leporello.
Guard? Guard?
The blessing has been given.
This way.
Have you seen the turnkey, Padre?
I think you will find him in the first cell.
No...
Mercy.
You can hardly expect us to be merciful, my dear count...
...while you remain so stubborn.
The Duke de Lorca's growing impatient.
Speak up, old man, or do you need more persuasion?
Again.
No.
Don Juan, here.
Hurry.
This way, here.
You've been summoned here tonight...
...because as students at the Royal Academy...
...I know your loyalty to the king and queen.
I also know that you'll be the first to suffer unless the Duke de Lorca is defeated.
There's only one way he can be beaten.
By arousing the people.
You know well that his men are everywhere.
The streets are filled with them.
So we must go about our business with the utmost secrecy.
First, we must...
- You can't go in here.
- How do you get in there?
Don Juan.
Go.
- Sebastian?
- Thank heaven I found you.
- What brings you? Is the queen all right?
- At the moment.
Since news of your escape reached the palace, Lorca's become desperate.
There's no telling what he might do.
You must get the queen out of the palace tonight.
- Her life is in danger.
- There aren't enough of us.
- Now, perhaps by tomorrow...
- No, tomorrow will be too late.
Tonight will be too soon.
We couldn't even get through the gates.
Do you know a way in?
At the far end of the palace grounds there is an opening in the garden wall.
And if you're careful, you can get in the same way I got out.
You will forgive this intrusion,
Your Majesty...
...but events move rapidly and we are pressed for time.
We asked the king to sign a document...
...declaring our country in a state of siege and granting us full power.
This is agreeable to His Majesty.
But he informs me that you are unwilling to cooperate in our plans for Spain.
- Is that correct?
- It is.
Does Your Majesty realize the consequence of such a refusal?
We do, indeed, Your Grace.
But rather than deliver our people into your hands, we would prefer to die.
If Your Majesty would only face reality...
We can face reality, but not treachery.
Nor will we bargain with a traitor.
We are well aware of your intentions,
Your Grace.
We shall never accede to such a request.
Then Your Majesty clears my conscience by signing her own death warrant.
Will you come with us peacefully?
Guards?
Come.
I'm looking for Her Majesty.
Do you know where I can find her?
- Her Majesty is in the chapel.
- In the chapel?
Then I better not disturb her.
- How do we get to the chapel?
- Down this corridor.
But it's all the way on the other side of the palace.
Guards, guards, guards, guar...!
Hey.
Don Juan, quickly.
They're taking the queen to the fortress.
Leporello, Serafino.
Fire guards, fire guards, call the fire guards!
Don Juan?
Rodrigo.
I warned you, señor.
This time I shall cut deeply.
This time I'm wearing my old clothes.
The sword is not for a traitor.
You die by the knife.
Your Majesties.
Your Majesty.
I had to see you.
I could stay away no longer.
Is it true that you are leaving?
- Tomorrow.
- But why?
Why do you have to leave Madrid now?
- You've become a hero of the people.
- Have I?
Then it must be easy to become a hero.
But for a man to be leaving the woman he truly loves...
...the woman he can never have, that's not easy.
But if you stay?
If I stay, it can only bring unhappiness to both of us.
I know that now. You must know it too.
Where will you go?
Who knows?
Into oblivion, I suppose, where most legends go.
No, there can be no oblivion for you.
Where you go, life follows.
Before you came back, Madrid was dead.
Now there's a heartbeat.
My heartbeat.
Juan, take me with you.
Strange.
Once to have heard those words would have brought me complete happiness.
Now they bring only pain.
You're the queen. Without you, the king would rule badly.
The people would suffer.
Your exile would be bitter.
Bitter?
Any more bitter than being married to a man who is estranged to me?
More bitter than having you go out of my life forever?
Once I promised you to devote myself to the welfare of our country.
Would you take away the one ruler who could bring her happiness?
I asked you that when I was queen.
I am no longer.
You are. You always will be.
I shall be the only one...
...who knew that for just a little while there was no queen.
- Just ahead lies the road to Lisbon.
- Yes.
There's a great new university there, Leporello.
I've decided to devote myself to some serious study.
Perhaps write my memoirs.
Well, it will be a change, anyway.
At long last, lead the peaceful calm of an academic life.
No more romance.
No more the idle search for beauty.
No more, no more...
Your pardon, señor.
Is this the road to Barcelona?
- It is, señorita.
- Thank you so very much.
- Adios.
- Adios.
Juan.
No more romance, eh?
My dear friend, there's a little bit of Don Juan in every man.
But since I am Don Juan, there must be more of it in me.
Kinostudio "Soyuzmultifilm"
Moscow, 1947
The Little Humpbacked Horse
Director
I. Vano
Past the woods and mountains steep,
Past the rolling waters deep,
Where the skies black earth behold,
Lived a peasant weak and old.
Of his sons, and he had three
Eldest sharp was as could be.
Second was nor dull nor bright,
But the third, a fool all right.
But, upon an evil day,
Dire misfortune came their way,
Someone, when the day was through
Took to trampling wheat they grew.
Day and night they sat and thought
How the villain could be caught.
Till at last they understood
Nightly guard would do them good.
You, Ivan just go around.
Watch the field and space abound.
We'll lay low and watch this spot,
Soon the loathsome thief be caught!
Stars, stars... one, two, three...
All night long, I count thee
Four, five, six and... there's seven!
Fingers ten can't count all heaven!
If you will set me free,
Two brave stallions I would give thee
And such handsome steeds I'd bear
As have ne'er been seen, I swear.
If you wish, why, sell the two,
But part not with the little steed!
Faithful friend to you he'll be,
Where you go, on land or sea.
So, farewell!
I will roam free...
But not in our field!
Log house, stove… all swing around, ain’t no place for the master to lay down.
Where in this hangover dread,
Shall I hide my rowdy head?
Don’t you worry ‘bout the boot,
Hey, stomp with your foot.
Drunks “knee-deep” all seas shall measure,
But their heads they do not treasure.
Heavens! Look what lovely pair, our young fool has hidden there!
Oh, the field, the field of mine
Roaming free just feels so fine!
Roaming free just feels... Hugh?!
Oh, my horses black as night,
With your golden manes so bright!
Did not I look after you?
What foul devil stole you? Who?
Don’t blame devils for their deeds, your two brothers stole those steeds!
Yes, your loss is great, I know
But I'll help you in your woe.
Mount my back-when I say: 'Go',
Hold to me for all you know!
What a wonder, like a flame!
Look, there's light in plenty here,
But no smoke or heat, I swear!
And you very well may stare!
That's a Fire-Bird's feather there!
But, for your own sake,
Touch it not, for in its wake.
Many sorrows, many woes,
Follow everywhere it goes.
That is not a truth,
I am not such a fool!
Many sorrows, many woes
Follow everywhere it goes.
Honest masters, come this way!
See what wares we have today!
Foxes, ferrets… different furs!
Saddles and some horsewhips sound!
Tawed reins!
Honey cakes!
Spiced brine apples!
Savor all my gingerbreads!
Tsar’s approaching!
Redhead chamberlain ‘side him,
He’s horse keepers’ chief supreme.
What a sight they’re to behold
Just to me, you will be sold!
Who's the owner?
My good people, who...
Owns these handsome chargers two?
Tsar, these steeds belong to me,
I'm their owner, too, you see.
Well, I wish to buy the team.
Would you sell them to me?
No, I'm swapping them.
What will you be taking, then?
Two times five fistfuls of silver.
Two times five...? Ten.
Ten!
Oh, um...
Well...
Shake hands!
Hey, you! Bring the treasury!
Whatcha looking at, old snake?
Take the steeds, for goodness sake!
Oh, brothers, what a show!
I could die just laughing so!
Now, my grooms can't hold those two,
So, there's nothing else to do.
You come and serve to me,
I'll pay with gold to thee!
Make you Master of my Horse,
Like a lord, you'll live, of course.
What a wonder!
Let it be!
I shall serve Your Majesty!
Have I fallen from your grace?
And my job which I embrace?
My displeasure, do observe!
Under Ivan you shall serve!
Take them, Ivan, faithful slave
To my stable, steeds so brave!
Just you wait, you dirty lout,
Time will come, I'll turn you out.
Tsar’s Stables
Servant life is sloth and folly
Chasing pigeons - he is jolly.
Steeds well-fed and clean appear
Could some ghost be working here?
Can it be, a goblin sprite
Comes and braids their manes at night?
Spy on him - that's what I shall do.
And won’t stop until I’m through!
I’ll your silky bangs unbraid
With a fine-toothed comb inlaid
Brush your manes and braid 'em back
And admire your beauty black.
Oh you, skipping horses mine
You are graceful, you are fine!
But the heart perceives most dear
My humpback that’s always near.
This shall be your bitter end,
To the gallows you’ll be sent.
All the Court knows it is true,
What Ivan conceals from you.
Tisn't silver, tisn't gold,
Fire-Bird's feather, Sire…Behold!
And he boasts, as I've heard,
That, did you but say the word,
He could bring the Bird of Fire,
To your Royal Chamber, Sire.
Hey, fetch for me that foolish lad!
Won’t escape my fist-too bad!
By what law and what decree
Have you from Our Majesty
Hidden what is ours by right?
Yes, the Fire-Bird's feather bright?
Pardon me this once, please do
And I'll lie no more to you.
You'll be pardoned for the nonce,
Seeing you have sinned but once.
You have boasted, as I've heard,
That, did I but say the word,
You could bring the Bird of Fire
To the Chamber of your Sire.
May the lightning strike my head if such thing I ever said!
If you do not bring the Bird of Fire,
To my Royal Chamber, now,
By my Royal Beard I vow,
I will find you anywhere!
I'll destroy you! Get out!
Slave!
Yes, cry now!
You rejected my advice, now, you have to pay the price.
Oh, whatever shall I do?
Help me, oh my friend so true.
It is not an easy deed, but together we'll succeed!
So, listen to me well!
Telling you in language plain,
We will need the best of grain,
And two troughs; then, if you please,
Wine, brought in from overseas.
Really, we’ve no time to waste.
And at dawn we must make haste.
Ivan’s gone long time from here.
Somewhere lies he drunk, I fear.
Let you down this time, I think,
Broke decrees and did not blink.
Were he empty-handed to arrive
I would have to skin the fool alive.
I am twisting little rope
Lovingly, kid’s noose I grope
He shall test the strength of threads.
Soon, I’ll finish with my noose
Insult’s gone when he’ll hang loose.
Vile hound, snout of swine!
May you bow-like twist your spine!
May you choke on birch bark shoe!
May you fall the black earth through!
What have you brought back for me?
Show me! Patience’s not my trait.
Father Tsar, a moment’s wait!
Shut the chamber casement tight,
Draw the shades, keep out the light.
Hey, boyars! You should make haste need day with night replaced!
Oh how lively you do leap
Come enjoy your peaceful keep!
Vanya, friend, I love you so,
Lightened is my heart, you know.
And, in token of my joy,
Be my Royal Groom, my boy!
You won't always prosper so,
Have such foolish luck, oh no!
I'll get you in trouble, yet!
Yes, I will, my little pet!
In a distant German lands,
Flows an ocean, like no others;
And it washes foreign shores,
And it's sailed by merchant moors.
Sailors tell about a maiden fair,
Living on that ocean there.
She's no common maiden, see
Daughter to the Sun is she,
Moon’s her brother, goes the word
Scarlet dress she wears...
I'll get you in trouble, yet!
Yes, I will, my little pet!
SAUNA
Get him, get him get him clean
Front and back and in between
Birch twig switch of leafy green
One, two-water off duck’s back is dripping
Good health comes from all this whipping.
And will be our Father mild
Rosy red like tender child
From the waters boiling wild.
One, two-water off duck’s back is dripping
Good health comes from all this whipping.
One, two-water off duck’s back is dripping
Good health comes from all this whipping.
Tsar, your Vanya gaily said,
Swearing by your Royal Head,
That he knew this birdie -yes-
So he called her, I confess.
And, O Sire, it's also true
That he bragged to catch her, too.
I have been informed, dear Vanya,
That just now, my lad, you said,
Swearing by my Royal Head,
That, did I but say the word,
You could bring another bird.
For your Monarch, you did swear, you could catch the Tsar-Maid Fair.
My Tsar, that's not true.
Someone has been lying to you.
What! You don't want to obey?
Listen to me, my lad...
If you do not bring to me
That Tsar-Maid, in short weeks three,
To my Chamber, lovely bird,
Mark, Ivan, my royal word,
You’ll be pulled apart in pieces!
In this lovely silky tent
I my loneliness lament
And for no-one my voice sings
As I nod and pluck my strings.
Oh dear Tsar, it’s time to sing
Since Tsar-Maiden he won’t bring
Serf has played another trick
Drive him in a coffin thick.
Peerless, beautiful princess,
Be my bride! Agree - say yes!
Oh! Your lovely eyes so bright
They will haunt me day and night!
They will torture me by day,
And at nights, drive sleep away!
Say but one sweet word to me
Everything is ready, see.
And tomorrow, oh my life,
We'll be wedded man and wife.
I will never marry you!
Old man and toothless, too!
I may be old, yet I’m lively and I’m bold.
I would marry you only if you're still young.
But I love you more than life!
Why can you not be my wife?
You regain your youth anew,
And I'll gladly marry you.
Listen, early in the morn,
On the palace court-yard lawn,
You must have put on three cauldrons ready,
Two-on fires burning steady.
Now, the first one must be filled
To the brim, with water chilled,
While the next - with water hot.
Then, with milk fill up the last,
Heat it, till the milk boils fast.
If you want to marry me,
Young and handsome wish to be,
First you must your robes divest,
Plunge into the milk, undressed.
Next, in boiling water. Then,
In the water cold - and when
You emerge - Oh, Father my,
You’ll be young and handsome guy.
Oh, dear Father, don’t get sad,
Try this trick on our lad.
Cauldrons' magic he should test
If it works, then be my guest.
Tomorrow morn, on the palace court-yard lawn,
You, Ivan, must do your best
These three cauldrons you must test.
First bathe in the milk, my son,
Then the waters, one by one.
But I'll be boiled alive!
Chickens, pigs, and turkeys -yes-
People scald them, I confess.
I could bath in cold water, yeah, but in boiling water - no way!
What? You defy to me?
Put him under lock and key!
Talk like this, you getting then
Bread and water regimen!
First you do the cauldron bit
Then we’ll talk about it.
If we only never met.
Woes to you, I do regret.
Tsar will be the death of me.
He’ll be boiling me, you see.
God bless you and do not cry.
We will manage, you and I.
I would sooner perish, than leave you in the lurch, Ivan.
Say to Tsar: Your Gracious Majesty!
Please to send my horse to me,
So that I can say good-bye
To my horse before I die.
Tsar will agree, you'll see.
Now, sleep in peace and forget your cares.
Now, undress yourself, my man
Try the cauldrons best you can.
Oh, allow Your Majesty,
Please to send my horse to me
So that I can say good-bye before I die.
If the milk doesn't boil proper, water one will be his stopper.
Why are you just staying still?
Wait’s been long, now do my will!

-THE END-
I like to see the morning run of my dogs, Carraclough.
-That's what I get up for.
-A beautiful sight to start the day.
All the years I've watched it, every morning is finer than the day before.
You're a great man with dogs, Carraclough.
Thank you, Your Grace.
And that I am.
Good morning, Lassie.
You're still the finest of them all.
Yeah, she's champion.
Finest dog in all of Yorkshire.
Yes, when you've got champion dogs in the country...
...you've got champion men.
I think, sir, 'tis Lassie's tyke himself.
Where is he, girl?
There are only two things in the world
I am proud of:
My puppies and my flowers.
It's either puppies or flowers a man must be proud of.
I don't think it can be both.
-My hydrangeas!
-That's what I meant, sir.
Of all the stupid, crazy puppies in the--
He's not stupid, he's only very young.
Never too early to start his training.
A firm hand, Joe. Belt him one.
I can't. He's such a foolish thing.
Don't you agree, Father?
-I agree with you.
-You're quite wrong, Priscilla.
That pup'll grow up an irresponsible hoodlum.
-Look what he's done to my gardens.
-Perhaps he just doesn't like gardens.
Nonsense! Everybody likes gardens.
Happen it's a point of view.
Your Grace likes them to look at, and the tyke likes them as much to roll in.
Something must be done about that pup.
At last, we've got a dog like our Lassie.
I want him trained, then I'll show him.
I'll make him an international champion.
That's a great deal of "l" for another man's dog.
It's the only way. If you don't train him, it'll be a scandal to every dog lover.
But he's only a puppy, sir.
If there's a scandal to bear, there's no one to bear it but Joe.
For there's nobody's dog but his.
That's the way it was with you, Lassie.
That's the way it's got to be with your tyke.
There's only one way you'll get that dog, Grandfather.
Oh, and how's that?
You'll have to marry into the family.
Wait, Joe.
Laddie, flowers are not to eat.
Good morning, Joe.
Good morning.
Goodbye.
Hey! Look out for my hydrangeas!
Little scoundrel does more damage to them than the pup.
No sense.
Like all the lads these days, no sense at all.
I'm surprised at you, Carraclough.
-You should've been firmer with the lad.
-Your Grace, happen I should.
But the last day of his leave is late to start.
He leaves in the morning for an advanced flying school.
Oh, does he? Good for him.
Look alive, now, girl. Look alive.
I never was so much alive,
Grandfather.
Oh, you can't sleep, so I can't either, eh?
What happens to you happens to me.
What's that, another scratch?
When are you going to learn that there are no friendly cats?
You know you've got to start looking out for yourself when I'm away.
Lose your appetite for other people's shoes.
They don't digest very well, anyway.
And be reserved when people come to call.
A friendly pat doesn't mean they want to wrestle with you.
Now, bear that in mind while I'm away.
Good morning, Lassie.
Look. Look who's here.
Come on. That's enough.
Now, you stay down there.
I gotta get dressed.
Stop it.
Now, you stop that.
I gotta get dressed.
Laddie.
Stop it.
Thank you, Lassie.
That's a good girl.
Now, why can't you do that?
You never learn anything.
Well, you look better in it than I do,
I must say.
Come on.
You know something?
He got your looks, but he didn't get your brains.
Laddie! What are you doing to my football?
What happened?
What happened?!
It's that wild beast of yours!
My washing!
Look!
Go after him, Joe!
He'll have the house about our heads!
Hey, come here!
-Are you hurt?
-Look at him!
Let go! Let go!
You tiger!
Let go!
Your papa's drawers!
Stop him! Stop him!
Laddie!
Oh, my present.
-What is it?
-Well, it-- It was a cake.
My first.
You baked it?
With my own fair hands.
Look at them.
Still, it-- It was worth it.
I've been trying to get into this position for months.
-Sorry.
-Oh, Joe.
What am I going to do about you?
I'm sorry. Laddie ran off with my father's drawers, and I tried to stop him.
Are you going to talk about your father's drawers or me?
-You do like me, don't you?
-l....
-Of course I do.
-Then why don't you say it?
A man doesn't say everything he feels, does he?
Yes, in wartimes, and when he's going away.
-But I'm only off to school, and besides--
-"Besides" what?
Well, it wouldn't be proper.
"Proper is proper," as my father says.
Ask your grandfather.
Grandfather's 60, and he's not going to risk his life.
You're 1 7, and you are going to risk yours.
So it's your right to decide.
Will you leave that dog alone?
Laddie, lie down!
Well!
I suppose he's trained to do that?
No, Priscilla. He's mixed up.
It's clever of him, but it's my fault...
...because one day he was chewing at my trousers...
...and I told him to L-l-E D-O-W-N.
L-l-A-R!
Please, Priscilla, pull it up.
Priscilla!
For pity's sake!
Bloomers start rumors!
I was just showing Joe what fine, straight legs...
...his children are going to have.
Hang their little legs!
Pull your skirt up. Be quick about it.
Hello? A military car.
At last, I'm called up!
Must have been that last letter
I wrote to the prime minister.
-Good morning, I'm the Duke of Rudling.
-Major Ellison. This is Captain Graves.
-How do you do? This is a happy day.
-Thank you, sir.
Among your letters, we find an offer to mobilize Rudling Kennels...
...into a war dog's training school.
It isn't exactly combat duty.
However, an old soldier accepts any command.
It'll be the duty of Rudling Kennels, sir, to select dogs...
...and pass on their fitness for enlistment.
I should like to see your kennel man, Sam Carraclough.
This is Sam Carraclough.
Morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Carraclough, you're to be in command here.
What?
You have the reputation of being the finest dog man in Yorkshire.
Gentlemen, I have no wish to take credit for something I was born with.
The scoundrel.
Congratulations, Father.
Oh, that's so wonderful,
Mr. Carraclough.
Thank you, miss.
Now, Mr. Carraclough....
Joe!
Joe!
Aren't you going to say goodbye?
You know your grandfather would never approve...
...of us.
And you know how I manage him.
But what does it matter, if you don't love me?
Who said I didn't love you?
Then say it, Joe.
Go on, say it.
Please say it, Joe.
I do love you.
I'll be waiting.
-Goodbye, sir.
-Good day, good day.
Carraclough, it seems from now on, you'll be giving the orders here.
-lt does seem that way.
-There's one thing I insist upon.
-What's that?
-I'm to be second-in-command.
That'll be fine.
I shouldn't dare show my face in the village otherwise.
Carraclough, you must feel free to convert the estate as you think fit.
Thank you. We'll try not to disturb the hydrangeas.
I should think not.
They're the best hydrangea--
Look! Great Scott!
Look what your confounded puppy's done to my hydrangea!
Here, Laddie! Come on, Lassie.
Come on.
Laddie, you get bigger, but you never grow up.
Does he, Lassie?
Here.
Lassie, are you glad we're both grown-up?
There's one thing you don't like about it.
It means you're getting old.
The things I used to do with you
I do with him now.
But thanks for giving him to me anyway.
While you were about it, why didn't you give him some brains?
Perhaps you did at that.
A shoe is more useful than a stick.
Come on, tyke.
This is only for Laddie.
Run on home, old girl.
Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.
All right, Smith, get going.
Get them in line.
Quiet.
Come on, Johnson. Keep moving.
Hut, two, three, four.
Heel.
Quiet.
Heel.
-Two more recruits for us, sir.
-You'll win the war single-handed.
We'll train more dogs than they know what to do with.
Corporal, take these dogs in.
Yes, I have a recruit myself.
You have? And what dog's that?
Laddie, son of Lassie.
Fine, but I thought that boy of yours didn't want him trained.
I talked it over with him last night.
He's on his way to active duty.
And now, with Lassie too old, and the kennel's in the war...
-...I think he sees our point.
-Good for him.
You hear that, Priscilla?
-Young Carraclough's enrolling Laddie.
-Yes, Grandfather, I know all about it.
Well, my boy, you--
You look better than usual.
-Thank you.
-I'm glad to have Laddie join up.
Oh, here's-- Here's his collar.
-Do you think he can do it? The training?
-Put it on him.
Hard discipline teaches it to man and dog.
I don't think you could ever teach it to Laddie.
Here, Joe. You're off for duty, so you'll have no more to do with the dog.
The training will be good for him.
Come along. We'll take him to the field.
-Come on.
-Yes.
The army will make him a champion,
Joe. Come along, Priscilla.
Up!
We find it best to let backward dogs see others leap hurdles successfully.
It makes them want to do as well.
Do you think so, sir?
Well, let me show you.
Come on. Over!
-Hut! Hut!
-Hut! Hut!
Attaboy.
Good fellow.
There you are.
Now, then, Laddie.
Are you ready, huh?
Come along.
Now, then. Come on. Over you go.
He's not very bright.
No. No, he isn't.
Well, at least he's resourceful.
Come along. Bring him out here.
Stop it!
This is a test of courage and a fighting heart.
Like a good soldier, a dog must be steady under fire.
We train dogs in other things...
...but a dog that breaks under fire is unfit for military purposes.
-Now, watch this. All right, let him go.
-Go get him!
Come on, Laddie. Go!
A perfect dog on points who's a perfect fool.
No matter what anyone says, Laddie, you're still the finest champion ever.
May I take Joe away now?
-Go run along, Priscilla.
-With Joe? That's what I came for.
Here, Joe. Here's our picnic.
I'd like to have a word with you, miss.
Oh, Grandfather.
It's pointless to worry the lad.
He's not "the lad. "
He's Sergeant Joe Carraclough.
I intend to worry him as much as I can.
Priscilla, you're distinctly offside.
I'm on Joe's side, Grandfather.
You're not free to be.
You're very old, Grandfather...
...and you think very old things.
You're very young, my dear...
...and you think very young things.
Run along, run along.
If you don't run, you won't catch him.
Good morning, Mr. Carraclough.
Good morning, miss.
I-- I was just taking a little walk.
The bus will be passing here soon.
Laddie, come back here!
Do you think he'll come back when he gets hungry?
I doubt it, miss.
That's where his heart is.
Yes.
And mine.
For the first day, you didn't do badly.
I guess you'll fly with me.
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.
I could have replaced you, but the boy I'd get would be just as bad.
Say, you wanna see a swell pinup?
Here.
That's Boots. It's the sharpest dog in all of Canada.
He can do everything.
He really smokes that pipe.
-I don't think I'd want my dog to smoke.
-What is your dog?
I have two collies, Lassie and Laddie.
What tricks can they do?
Well, Lassie does some, but Laddie doesn't do any.
-No good, eh?
-Oh, he's a champion.
You mean he's a fighter?
No, not a fighter.
They're both champions.
When the Duke of Rudling owned Lassie...
...she walked from Scotland to England to come home to me.
That's a champion.
That stops you.
Good night, Eddie.
If I'd known you were part of a duke,
I'd never have picked you.
Oh, I'm not. We're cottagers.
It's only the dogs that are champion.
You know, Joe, you're not a bad little kid.
Not very sharp, but not a bad little kid.
Laddie, what are you doing here?
Quiet! Hide him under the covers.
Try not to disturb the men.
He's my dog, sir.
I don't know how he got here.
I remind you that the possession of a dog is an infraction of regulations.
He has no right here.
He's creating confusion.
He's-- He's...
...beautiful, isn't he?
May I have permission to take him home?
He's tired. It's 40 miles from here.
Forty miles?
-Smart dog.
-That's what's so wonderful.
He's never done anything so wonderful.
-And he had better never do it again.
-Yes, sir.
What's this?
That's-- He was sort of enlisted...
...but I don't think it ever quite took.
Right in here, sir.
-That the boy?
-Yeah, that's him.
Father, what are you doing here?
I came for the tyke.
Four hours on the bus.
Well, you'll run away no more, my fine lad.
-Come on. Goodbye, Joe.
-Goodbye.
This is Eddie, the chap
I was telling you about.
-How do you do, sir?
-How do you do?
-Oh, this is the warrant officer.
-How do you do, sir?
Pleasure, I'm sure. Well, goodbye, Joe.
Oh, Father.
Wasn't it clever of him to find me?
I never thought he could do it.
Happen he's Lassie's pup after all.
Well, I must run along.
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, Laddie.
-Oh, Eric?
-Yes?
I'm a fool to lend Joe to you.
Last week, I lent you my razor...
-...and I didn't get it back.
-Anything good I don't give back.
-Goodbye. See you in a couple of hours.
-So long, kid.
Take care of him until I get back.
Stay here.
Laddie, come here!
Laddie!
When Carraclough comes back, he can spend a month's pay shipping him home.
Come on, Laddie.
Boy, you sure are stubborn.
Guess you're in love, huh?
Well, he'll be back in a couple of hours.
Just watch for four planes coming home.
Mattie.
What happened to Eric and Joe?
Last time we saw them was over the target. Started lagging behind and....
Better list them as missing.
So you finally coughed your way home.
Y es, Jerry gave us a few. I had to bring her home with one engine.
But I brought your navigator back, so you can use him again tomorrow.
-What'd you do with Laddie?
-I didn't do.
Come on, I'll show you.
Hey, now, Laddie.
Everything's gonna be all right.
You'll have to sleep out here with him.
Can't take him into the barracks.
-Yeah, I suppose I'll have to.
-Sleep well.
We've got a reconnaissance job tomorrow.
I'll be ready.
Oh, look, Joe.
The sergeant major says
Laddie's gotta be shipped home.
But I ran across Jerry Bartlett from our squadron. He's got some leave coming...
...and he'll be going right near your home, so you leave that to me.
-Thanks, Eddie.
-Look, boy...
...you don't have to put on an act for me.
I've seen an air marshal bawl like a baby when he had to leave his dog.
You know something, Laddie?
You've got to understand something before you go home this time.
One of the little things about war is you can't have your dog.
You're a very little thing for me to give up...
...when men are giving up their children.
I suppose when I have a child, the feeling will be something like this.
It probably won't be anything like it.
Perhaps I'll never know about it.
But, anyway, I know about you.
I won't see you anymore.
Photographs of this section of the coast of Norway...
...show us the beginnings of some new kind of activity.
However, all our pictures have been from 35,000 feet.
T oday, we should like to get some from a bit lower. Understand?
-Yes, sir.
-It's dangerous.
There'll be flak, of course.
But it's also important to know exactly what Jerry's doing there.
-Any comments, Eddie?
-No, sir.
That's rather unusual for you.
-Well, that's all. Cheerio.
-Good show.
Cheerio.
Laddie! What are you doing here?
-Laddie ever been in Norway?
-No.
Yes, he has, for the last three minutes.
We're getting close!
Look out, Laddie.
"There'll be flak," he said, and he wasn't kidding.
-Better hit the silk, Joe.
-But what about you?
I'll be right after you. Go ahead.
Hurry up. We're losing altitude. Jump!
Hurry up! I'm right behind you.
-Karl, look! I told you I saw something.
-That's a dog, not a parachute.
He is crazy. There's nothing here.
Maybe there is a name on his collar.
Here's a tag.
Quiet!
He is gone.
An English dog means an English soldier.
Maybe paratroopers are landing in this section.
We'd better get back and report this.
A puppy!
I found a puppy!
Come on, puppy, let's play.
Thea! Arne!
Thea! Arne!
I'll be right back, puppy.
Thea! Thea!
My puppy! My puppy is sick!
My puppy! My brand-new, sick puppy!
You see, come on!
Oh, he always thinks about his dog, the one the Germans shot.
-Here's your puppy.
-And not sick at all. He's just fine, see?
No, no, my new puppy!
-My brand-new, sick puppy!
-This is your puppy.
Look. By the time we get home, it will be all better.
-Come on. Up you go, now.
-I want my puppy!
Now, you stay there and be a good boy.
I forgot my puppy back there!
Henrik, come back! Come back!
I want my puppy!
Henrik, come back! Be a good boy, and you'll get a wonderful puppy...
...all for yourself someday.
Henrik, come back!
Come back, Henrik!
See? Here's my new puppy.
Isn't he pretty?
I told you! He's sick.
His leg is hurt.
Hedda, tear a bandage from your apron.
I'll be spanked if I tear my apron.
Spanking or no spanking,
I'd tear my apron to help a sick dog.
It's easy to talk of tearing aprons when you don't wear any.
Shame on you!
What are you doing?
Here, Thea. Make him well.
There. We'll take care of you.
We'll hide you from the Germans in our cave.
Oh, Arne, make a splint.
You know, the way I showed you when I broke my finger.
-Here's what's left of my lunch.
-Oh, that's a good girl, Hedda.
Oh, look, he's awfully hungry.
He probably hasn't eaten in a long time.
I have no more.
We can save our supper and then feed him tomorrow.
I won't get any supper because
I tore my shirt. But I've got a dog.
-He's my dog.
-He belongs to all of us.
-I found him.
-Well, then you can name him.
-What are you gonna call him?
-Let me see.
-I know!
-Yes?
-No.
-Well, it's getting late.
-Why not call him simply Doggy?
-What name did you say?
She didn't, she said to call him simply Doggy.
I like that.
We'll call him Mr. Simply.
Oh, hello, Mr. Simply.
Mr. Simply's going to sleep.
We'll come back early tomorrow.
Come on.
Happy dreams, Mr. Simply.
I don't think you'll find the poor dog in this village.
He wouldn't stop here.
No refuse bins.
-Why not?
-Because there is no refuse.
Oh, good evening, Mrs. Strohm.
Now, don't hurry on.
It's all right to come in.
Very devout woman, Mrs. Strohm.
You may have noticed her coming here in the evening to pray.
I shall try to find who are dog fanciers among my congregation.
Perhaps they will help.
Of course, when you consider, the only true dog fancier in the world is the flea.
Now!
Come on, Henrik.
Hurry up with that dog.
Come on.
Please, Mr. Simply. Come.
Stop it, Mr. Simply. Stop it!
Please, Mr. Simply. Come,
I've got something nice for you to eat.
Wait a minute.
-Henrik, what are you doing?
-Eat, Mr. Simply.
It's no use, he won't eat. He's been like this ever since he got well.
Eat, Mr. Simply. Please eat.
If you eat, you'll grow up to be a big, strong man.
Stop, now. You're only bothering him.
Besides, dogs don't grow up to be big, strong men.
-Not even if they eat?
-Not even if they drink milk.
Not even if they drink all the milk in the world?
-Not even then.
-Oh, well.
Maybe he doesn't like us anymore.
That's the way he looked when he was hurt.
Maybe he doesn't wanna be our dog.
Don't you?
Don't you want to be our dog?
-Germans!
-Come on, cover up the dog!
Did you hear what they said?
Very suspicious.
That's the first time
I've heard that from Norwegians.
-They are up to something.
-Come here!
-Have you seen a dog?
-Stand still!
Have you seen a dog?
-Well?
-Have we seen a dog?
-A dog?
-No, no dog here.
-What have you got here?
-Wood. We've been gathering firewood.
-What's the matter with him?
-He-- He thinks he's a dog.
He's very young. You know, playing.
He always plays that game.
He barks like this.
No! He barks like this!
No, like this!
All right, all right, go ahead!
What a country.
Stupid people, barking children.
Come on.
Mr. Simply!
Mr. Simply!
Please, God.
Keep Mr. Simply safe from the Germans.
I found him, and I love him.
And I don't want to lose him.
Bring Mr. Simply back.
Please, God, bring him back.
Look!
Halt!
Where did you get this dog?
He is English.
It's not my dog. I never saw him before.
You were here yesterday.
Why are you here again?
I come here every day.
-What about your dog?
-lt isn't my dog.
Look! If it were, it wouldn't run away from me.
You wait here!
Heavenly father, who hearest us always...
...grant these children their prayer for the safety of their dog.
In caring for our little animal brothers...
...these children are educating their hearts in unselfishness.
Preserve their pure hearts.
These children are not asking anything for themselves.
They ask only for the safety of a poor animal.
This love that fills their hearts is your love...
...which I ask shall ever abide in them...
-...and lead them in your footsteps.
-Mr. Simply!
It's a miracle!
Keep these children, as they are now, from selfishness...
...which is the wickedness, the vileness...
...the cruelty of the world.
We ask as always that everything that breathes...
...be preserved from suffering.
-What's in here?
-A storeroom.
-Why is it locked?
-T o keep out thieves.
Air raid!
Come here, Joe.
-This is a fine morning.
-Yes, it is.
I'm sorry to leave you and your wonderful stories about the Vikings.
I make a right liar, Joe.
One thing I told you is the truth.
One Viking alone can smash a platoon of Germans...
...just by standing on them with his two feet.
I believe it, Olav.
If I didn't have to stay here and hide you boys...
...I'd go down and jump on that German army myself to show you how it's done.
You are a good soldier too. I know that, because you are a good companion.
I'm afraid I've been talking mostly about my dog.
I know it's my duty to get back to England into the fight again...
...but it's not easy to leave Laddie behind.
I keep thinking about finding him.
Sometimes I even wake up at night and think I can hear him barking.
After what you and your friends have faced, I suppose I sound rather silly.
No, you're not silly.
It isn't silly to have something dear to your heart and to talk about it.
A man who lives for himself is very empty.
The others, they talk about their girls, their wives and children.
You talk about your dog, because you love him.
Now, remember, hide by day and travel by night.
And don't try to contact the underground. They'll find you.
Operator MCS will take you down to the coast.
When you get to the high cliffs, you can see Anton's house and his fishing boat.
Anton will contact the British intelligence.
Another soldier goes home to fight.
Goodbye, Olav.
-Goodbye.
-And thank you.
Well....
So you are Laddie, huh?
I've heard a lot about you...
...but I never thought
I was going to see you.
You are a long way from the duke's hydrangeas now, aren't you?
Well...
...you'll go back to England and dig up those hydrangeas again.
The duke will be so glad to see you...
...that he'll grow some new ones just for you.
MCS calling number 44.
MCS calling number 44.
Dangerous enemy activity along coast.
Cannot pass anyone now.
Flier returning to you until further notice from us.
You' re going to see him again.
He's coming back.
This is a wonderful day.
This is a reunion arranged by the gods...
...and only they and I shall see it.
You know, it should be Christmas.
We should have an evergreen tree over in that corner...
...and you should be under it.
I should have a big, fat belly and a long, white beard.
I believe you already know that he's coming, huh?
What? Is he here already?
Be quiet.
Those are men of pain, torture and killing.
A shame to tell a good animal this is what men have come to.
Maybe they will pass us by, and maybe they won't.
Be quiet.
Good day.
It's a cold one.
I'll stir up the fire.
Are you Olav Grieber?
-Yes.
-You live here alone?
Unfortunately.
The women I would like to marry won't live up here...
...and the women who would live up here, I wouldn't like to marry.
Do you have a radio?
No.
That's forbidden, isn't it?
No one's here. You're wasting your time and good shoe leather.
March out.
Where are you taking me?
The prison camp.
You're coming with us.
You won't need your cabin.
Besides, there's no one in there.
That's the truth, isn't it?
-Yes, that's the truth.
-No British soldiers?
No. Why do you ask me that?
Because we have caught one, and he came from this mountain.
Your hut won't shelter any more British.
No, wait!
The first I've seen in a whole year.
Hello, boy. Hello, chum.
-He understands.
-I believe it's a Britisher.
Ought to know better than to hang around here.
Go on, or we be finding you in a stew.
-A dog? What kind of dog?
-It's a collie. He's a beauty.
Oh, let me touch him.
Hello, boy. Hello, then.
Yes, it's good to meet you too.
Move back from the fence! Separate!
-Let him in, won't you?
-He's going to shoot him.
-No!
-Lower your gun!
It's Sergeant Schmidt.
Couldn't we have him in?
He'd be no trouble, I promise.
I could teach him to lead me, and then I could work and be some use.
Let the dog enter.
-Oh, you are a sweetheart.
-You are a little beauty.
Look, he's got a collar.
-"War dogs. "
-War dogs?
-What is he doing over here?
-You're a long way from home.
Here. That dog needs water and food. There.
Let him lead you, prisoner.
Thanks, sergeant.
That's decent of you.
I'll take him for a drink of water.
And at mess, he can share my rations.
Come on.
Clever fellow. How did you know it was my clothes peg?
This isn't mine.
I wonder whose--
Carraclough.
-Go to your quarters.
-You promised I should have him.
Go!
You stay here.
He's an English collie, and he came direct to that escaped prisoner's towel.
You think that poor-looking animal can follow the prisoner's scent...
...when your own trained dogs couldn't?
My dogs couldn't because the scent was overlapped by so many others.
But this dog knows only his master in this country.
You can see by his condition what he has been through.
He'll follow his single trail no matter who has crossed it.
Lower your tone, sergeant.
Any moment, I expect you to bark like a dog.
-Y es, sir.
-As a soldier, Schmidt...
...you're a comedian.
You're not a man, you're a clown.
And asking me for orders to trot all over Norway...
...with this bag of bones here to pursue a prisoner...
...is the culmination of your dog obsession.
-He's following the scent. You see?
-Quiet.
Don't bark.
Proceed, comedian. It will be pleasant not to have my eyes revolted...
...by that gargoyle shape in the uniform of our great army.
There. Y es, you're a good dog, a fine dog.
Here, here, there's nothing to be afraid of.
We're friends. Good friends, ja?
Now, you go ahead. Go ahead.
Ja, that's right, you want out.
Come on.
Come on. We'll go out too.
Olav certainly didn't exaggerate how kind you'd be to me.
I can't thank you enough,
Joanna, Anton.
When you are safe in England...
...send us a message through the underground. That's enough.
And when the war is over, we meet again, eh?
You both must come to England to meet my father.
He will not make us sleep in the cellar, eh?
Nothing but the best bedroom.
So young.
Take care of yourself.
You are still not strong.
It won't be easy for you to manage the boat on your own...
...even though it is a little one.
Anything bigger would be hard to hide from them.
But with luck, you should make it.
You know, you are very lucky...
...the British intelligence contacted a submarine.
-But you must be sure to--
-I'll be there at midnight. Don't worry.
Look.
Careful. Don't panic.
You know what to do and say.
You. Your papers.
Yours.
I'm sorry. He's not very....
Your papers!
Come. Both of you.
-Where to?
-You will see.
But we're just setting out for work.
We are fishermen. You saw our permits.
My husband is the only man in the district with a permit to fish.
-lf he does not go out, we shall starve.
-Too bad.
-But the tide is high now.
-lt'll be high again tonight and tomorrow.
Come.
-Don't worry, we will be all right.
-Anton.
We will be back tonight.
Won't we, Peter, old man?
All right, get to work.
This is too much, digging German fortifications.
Good practice for digging their graves.
Won't be long before the day of reckoning.
All right, get on the job!
-What is it?
-Look!
-It's Laddie! He's found me!
-Don't stop.
Keep digging. Whatever you do, you must not give yourself away.
-He's my dog.
-When the dog comes close to you...
-...kick him away from you. Beat him.
-Stop talking. Work.
I'm sure he's somewhere in the camp.
Probably posing as one of those workmen.
-Say "sir" when you address me, soldier.
-Sir.
What do you expect me to do?
Stop the work of the German army while you examine every man's papers?
That will not be necessary, sir.
With your permission....
Good dog.
Find him. Find your master.
-That's a fine dog.
-Come here.
I wonder what he's doing here.
There's a beautiful dog.
Evidently, the dog is owned by a corporation.
Everybody, quiet! Get back to work!
-Here, boy. Here, boy.
-Here! Stop that!
So the dog has found his master.
That's right, you found me.
I'm Joe Carraclough.
Come out of there!
Walk ahead, prisoner.
Where are you taking us?
Back to the prison from which you escaped. Let me warn you:
Any funny business, and I won't hesitate to kill.
I'm sure you won't.
You may be very sure.
Here, Laddie. Go get it.
He can't even retrieve a stick.
Your dog is a hopeless fool, and so are you.
Why didn't you kick him away from you?
If you kicked him, I would've believed you weren't the man I wanted.
That commanding officer thought I needed a guard to help me.
I alone found you, and I alone will take you in.
The high command may even hear of this exploit.
Turn around!
I ought to make you walk backward.
Then you'll pay attention to what I say!
And if I don't?
You are not wearing your uniform.
I can shoot you as a spy or for any reason that I choose.
Now, turn around!
And march!
I am in command here.
What I say is so.
You are not a soldier, you're a comedian.
-You are not a man, you are a clown.
-You may be right.
A clown is all you could capture.
Because you wouldn't hit the dog, you're a better man?
-I know I am.
-We shall see.
There are many ways in this world to judge the better man...
...but I know only one way!
The better man is the man who lives!
Come on, Laddie.
Come on, boy.
If he should live through those rapids, post a guard at the fisherman's house.
All right, Laddie.
In we go.
Lights are forbidden.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
What's that?
It is nothing but the tide.
Do you have to stand guard here all night?
It's orders.
Come in.
I'll give you some food.
-Good morning.
-Oh, excuse me.
Oh, no, please.
So you come here too?
It's a champion thing to do, sitting here looking out across the moors.
Joe always felt that too.
If I wanted to find him,
'tis here I'd look.
Some of our lads coming home.
There's nothing to bark at, Lassie.
I'd not be too sure, miss.
Things speak to her that don't speak to us.
Her ABC's are the stars, the wind and the rain and the scent...
...and all things that move with them.
If those were our ABC's, then we'd know what she knows.
Come on. Come on, Laddie.
Come on.
Oh, yes, there.
There, there.
Oh, yes, there.
Hey, Lass. Our lads have come home.
There, there.
Oh, yes, there.

Komdala!
What have you stolen this time, Cheetah?
Here. Hand it to me, Cheetah.
Cigarette case.
A wallet. Steely things to find here in the jungle.
Very odd.
Writing inside.
"To Gloria. Success."
"October 1928. Douglas."
Cheetah, where did you find the cigarette case?
Well, ask him, where he found it!
What is this, Cheeta?
Tarzan, I found out where the cigarette case came from and who it belonged to!
It belonged to Gloria James!
She was a famous flyer.
I was just a little girl, but... but I remember it!
She and her co-pilot left London on around the world flight.
They were never heard from again.
Listen.
"Flying through storm."
"Icing conditions at 12,000 feet."
"Losing altitude rapidly."
"Trying to persuade Graham to jump with me,"
"but he prefers to take his chances with the plane."
"Perhaps it's better."
"One of us might get through."
Rest of this is just blank pages.
Tomorrow you must take this to the trading post in Nyaga, and have them send it to England.
Better throw book in river.
Why?
This is proof of what happened to her.
What difference that make now?
Oh, there must be relatives and friends still alive in England.
This book belongs to them.
Some things better left alone.
You mean, you won't take it?
No.
Would you please tell me, why?
No.
All right.
Cheetah, stay.
Take care of Jane.
Get it outta here!
Glad to see you, Tarzan.
What brings you here?
Book.
Where did you get this?
In jungle.
The government has spent 20 years and 10,000 pounds trying to find this woman.
What woman?
Named Gloria James.
Gloria James?
Excuse me.
Trying to hold on at me?
I don't know what you mean.
No? There was a reward of a 1000 pounds to offer, dead or alive.
Might still be good.
I never heard of it.
And 5,000 more from a guy named Jessup if she were found alive. Remember?
Never heard of him either.
That's funny. It was hashed all over the newspapers, time and time again.
Jessup said this James woman was the only one who could clear him of a murder charge.
He's serving a life sentence.
You say this woman can get man out of jail?
She could if she were alive.
But she's dead.
Too bad, isn't it, Dodd?
Yeah.
To set it out for 20 years, and then find out one chance for freedom?
She's dead.
You send book to England?
Don't worry. We'll send it.
-- Won't we, Dodd?
-- Yeah.
I go.
So long.
When you send book...
...say, maybe...
...Gloria James not dead.
What do you think he means by that?
Search me.
But it's 50-50.
Hey, Trask?
Aha.
If a man's freedom depends on Gloria's presence, she may go.
But she must keep secret all she has known here.
Blue Valley will be trenched with blood because of this.
Obey the judgement of the High One, Pasco!
Tarzan shall not take this woman away!
Do not interfere, you have not the right.
Stop him!
Do not shoot!
Tarzan and the woman must not leave!
We we told to let them pass.
Tarzan has a pass to by the High One.
They go free.
Darling, I have been so worried about you.
Good.
Never go away anymore.
Thank you.
Who is here?
Who is she?
Gloria James. Lost flyer.
Gloria James?
Oh, you're playing a joke on me.
Hello.
Of course you're Jane.
Yes.
And you are?
Didn't Tarzan tell you?
I'm Gloria James.
Gloria James's plane crashed 20 years ago!
She'd be close to 50 years old now.
That's right.
Well...
If you're 50, I'll...
I'll eat Cheetah! Raw!
But I can't understand this: if you are Gloria James, then... why have you waited 20 years before you put in an appearance?
Live deep in jungle.
Only Tarzan know the way there.
Well, if you knew where she was, then... why didn't you show her the way out before?
Well...
Tarzan learned that I could free a man who's been in prison for 20 years.
Otherwise I never would have come back.
But from where?
Where have you been?
How could you live here in the jungle?
Getting late.
Tarzan, where has she been?
How can she look so young?
Soon she will not look young.
She will grow old quickly now.
We leave early in morning to Nyaga.
What do you think of Gloria James?
Phony.
I talked to her.
She knows all about flying...
...up to 20 years ago.
I've known women who were 50 and said they were 25, but I've never heard of a woman who was 25 and said she was 50.
Did you hear the story of the people living in the jungle and never seem to grow old?
I've heard a lot of wild tales about the jungle.
Should be there... something to eat or drink, that keeps them looking young?
You ask me to believe these fairy tales?
You know, if it were true, there'd be a fortune on that stuff, whatever it is.
Huh?
I know it's all a secret, but...
I'm still dying of curiosity.
Naturally.
20 years is a long time to explain away.
What are you going to tell them?
Nothing.
To be honest with you, I...
I'm frightened to death.
Anyway, I'll file a claim whatever it was when I get to Nairobi.
We'll see what happens.
In both our names.
Oh, of course!
Now it's time to take off.
If you hurry, miss James, you might still make it to the car plane to Nairobi.
Oh, I'm ready.
Good bye, Jane.
Good bye and lots of luck.
I'm giving you men, guns, and supplies.
You realize the risk that I'm taking with my money?
All I risk is my life.
There is no woman anywhere in the world that wouldn't pay any price to remain young.
Find it, and you'll be a millionaire.
You gotta get back to be a millionaire.
The going will be tough, but remember, what it's worth to you.
We still deal 50-50?
After expenses.
Good luck.
Wish me luck. I'll need it.
So...
...you do believe in fairy tales?
Well, aren't you gonna walk on my back,
Trask?
So far, so good, huh?
Yep. From here it's anybody's guest.
For 30 years I've explored every foot of this jungle.
It's gotta be in those mountains.
Make ready.
Only Tarzan knows the way here.
He must be destroyed.
I will go.
I will kill him.
Good girl, Cheetah.
Packages.
Magazines.
And letters!
This is for you, Cheetah.
A letter from Gloria!
Douglas Jessup is free!
And then they married!
Listen to this, Tarzan.
"I'm trying to persuade Douglas to return to Africa with me."
"Tarzan will understand."
"We want him to guide us back again to the Blue Valley."
The Blue Valley...
We saw it once, remember?
You will guide them back, won't you?
No!
A way there is secret.
But... I...
There's something that'll interest you.
A radio message from Gloria James.
She wants me to meet her in Nairobi and fly her to Tarzan's place.
She's got a husband with her now.
What's she coming back to Africa for?
You're asking me?
What would a woman come back for?
Sure. To keep young.
This means she wants Tarzan to guide her to that place, whatever it is.
You've got it.
No news of Vredak?
Not a word.
You know how I always say:
You want a thing done well, do it yourself.
Uhu.
Tarzan?
Same question again?
You tried to kill me! Why?
Why?
You don't keep secret.
You tell people a way to our valley.
Tarzan tell no one.
But people come. We killed them.
We kill you, too!
Tell your people Tarzan is their friend.
Tarzan your friend, too.
Go. Go!
Maybe it's Gloria. Come on, Cheetah.
They are landing.
Mr. Trask.
Hey, Mr. Dodd.
-- Surprised?
-- Yeah.
Well, we've got another surprise for you.
Jane.
Gloria...
Jane, darling.
This is my husband Douglas.
This is Jane.
-- Jane.
-- How do you do?
I really feel we don't need an introduction.
Dodd has some work to do on the plane before we go back.
Is it all right if we put a camp for tonight?
Why, certainly.
Thanks.
Tarzan will be back soon.
Shall we go to the house?
All right.
You were shocked when you saw me, weren't you?
I was already old when I reached London.
It's one thing to grow old gracefully, year by year, but...
I aged almost overnight.
I haven't told Douglas anything.
I made up my mind to return when we were married.
I felt that... but he was...
We were both entitled to the years we'd lost.
Tarzan will take us back.
Won't he?
I'll make him.
You and Douglas have the right to go back.
Match!
Meat.
Pepper.
Thank you.
You told me Cheetah is a smart monkey, but I didn't know she was that smart.
Cheetah isn't a monkey, darling.
She's a chimpanzee.
Oh. My african education is beginning.
Tarzan's coming.
Tarzan! Gloria and Douglas Jessup are here.
Dodd and Trask flew them in from Nyaga today.
Trask?
Dodd?
Yes. Come to meet Douglas.
Tarzan, are you going to be stubborn?
Tarzan, you must listen.
We go fishing, Cheetah.
But you can't go fishing!
Douglas and Gloria are depending on you!
Come, Cheetah. We go fishing!
Oh... you...
You!
You know, when... when Gloria suggested this trip, I was a little doubtful.
Oh, I wanted to see the place she'd live in, and the natives that'd be so kind to her.
Well, now I understand.
This is a wonderful country.
Mr. Jessup... huh...
Eh... just where is this place?
Oh, somewhere in the interior.
Tarzan knows a way there.
Oh, we're out of luck, Trask.
No flying for us until I can replace this part.
You mean, we're stuck here?
Yeah, it looks like it.
Unless eh... if it's on the way, maybe
Tarzan'll take us along until we can go straight off to Nyaga.
Tarzan take no one.
Gloria and man have made mistake.
Gloria and I have traveled thousands of miles.
I go.
Tarzan.
Tarzan!
He's gone.
I'll guide you.
I know the jungle, and I know the way to the Blue Valley.
Cheetah.
You help me teach Jane big lesson?
Tarzan follow.
Don't tell Jane.
We'll camp here.
Getting too dark to go on.
But I still insist, it's a great country.
Chimp scared the daylights out of me.
When we run into the lions...
You know, Dodd, that's not a least bit funny.
Lesson number one. Good one!
What's the matter? A lion?
No! Ants!
Ants...
-- Ants?
-- No, a lion!
Mr. Trask?
Are you familiar with this part of the jungle?
Lost?
No.
But I believe we've missed the trail to Nyaga.
You didn't expect us to leave you, did you?
But I can't take you.
Why not? We'll help you get through.
What's so mysterious about this Blue Valley anyway?
Mysterious?
Why wouldn't Tarzan guide us?
Don't you suppose Tarzan could be a little jealous of his knowledge of jungle trails?
Wants to keep the whole jungle to himself, huh?
But one thing is certain: if we don't find some water, we're gonna be pretty thirsty.
Hey!
We found water!
Cheetah!
Cheetah!
Cheetah!
Is the water all right?
Not set to drink...
Look at this.
Not food either.
I'm sorry I got you into all this.
Nobody's blaming you, Jane.
I'm sure we'll get through, all right?
You think so?
With that chimp passing on our food and water and turning it all down?
Where's Jane?
I wonder where we are.
Up a crick as usual.
We gotta get out of here!
Tarzan.
Still cold?
Not anymore.
Tarzan, I'm so glad you came.
I never should have stayed in that ravine after the rain started.
Jane know better next time.
We go back in the morning.
But Tarzan... we've come so far!
Can't you...
I'm sorry, Gloria.
We go back in morning.
Where's Tarzan?
I was just looking for him myself.
Dodd! Wake up!
Huh?
We've been double crossed. Tarzan's gone.
We lost two honey-moons.
Cheetah.
Follow Tarzan.
No, Cheetah.
Cheetah and I will go back.
If you think anything, that champ will change your mind.
Dodd and I know what's in that place, and we're going to get there.
This man Vredak.
Oh it's horrible.
People of Valley maybe not friendly now.
We'll go on.
Make ready.
It's Tarzan!
She can't be the same one.
You will know who she is when you hear her speak.
Her skin is wrinkled and the hair is gray.
In the outside world all grow old.
You'll remain here until the High One passes his judgement upon you.
Death to Tarzan!
-- Death to all betrayers!
-- Kill Them!
Gloria and her man want to stay.
Never leave again.
Yes.
Forever.
I wish I could welcome you more graciously, my friends.
But I have had to deal with fear.
A fear that has entered the hearts and minds of my people.
This fear... because their secret has been taken out to the world, and trespassers have attempted to conquer us.
I say again, it was Tarzan who betrayed us.
But the High One has welcomed them all.
Tarzan has deceived the High One.
Siko and I will avenge this betrayer tonight. if the way to our valley is dark, it is not so easily found.
One needs his eyes to see.
His eyes?
His eyes.
We must find Tarzan, Cheetah.
Are you keeping track of where we are?
Yeah.
We've been traveling south-south-east.
This country will be a sench to spot from the air.
The man, the woman and Tarzan have been freed by the High One.
-- Freed?
-- Yes.
The man and woman shall remain with us.
But henceforth no one may enter or leave the valley.
I see that you are impressed.
Deeply impressed.
The potency of the water is lost once it has touched the ground.
That is why it is taken from the spring.
The waters have the power to restore youth, and heal the sick.
We have kept its existence in secret from the outside world.
Lest the greediest war men to come for us and exploit our treasure.
Lilisa, bring a vial of the water, that our friends may envigorate themselves after their wears on the journey.
Dwell amongst us as one of our people.
Thank you, ma'am.
This is as far as they got.
You will be freed in time, but our secret will be safe.
To find a way here one must be able to see.
Heat it for that's right there.
Hurry, Cheetah!
More strangers.
Mr. Trask!
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Cheetah!
Cheetah!
Don't tease me, Tarzan.
What made Gloria James stay so young?
Cheetah has present for you.
Give me that, Cheetah.
Cheetah...
Cheetah!
Cheetah...
The End.

The Star of Rhodesia is one of the most famous of the Earth's treasures.
First touched by the fingers of the humble
It would have been better had it never been found... for all those who possessed it came to sudden and violent death.
Our story opens in London within the sound of
In the shadow of Tower Bridge is the carpenter's shop of Mock and Son, coffin makers.
A beautiful job if I may so.
You'll be sure to have it at the undertakers in time?
Of course.
The Scotch Express leaves Uston Station at 7:30 tonight.
That leaves very little time for the arrangement of the body.
Your mother is it not?
Yes.
You are taking her to Scotland?
Yes, Edinburgh, her home.
Oh thank you.
Rather a nuisance traveling by train... ain't it?
Off with you.
Go on get about your business.
Oh.
I'm terribly sorry.
Mr. Holmes.
Hello.
I was afraid you wouldn't get here in time.
I was studying the faces of our fellow passengers.
Fascinating hobby and sometimes most enlightening.
Lady Margaret is aboard the train I presume?
Oh yes, mother's expecting you.
I reserved a compartment for you and your friend, Doctor Watson.
As a matter of fact, it's in this coach here, just ahead of the luggage van.
Day coach?
Yes the seats are all taken.
Mother wasn't interested in a bed so much as she was into getting to Edinburgh.
So naturally it wasn't very difficult to persuade her to travel in a day coach.
Exactly.
It had been open to take on additional passengers.
So I observed.
I say it was awfully decent of you to come considering the fact that
I was so secretive about it all.
Mr. Dear Mr. Carstairs, there was no need for secrecy
I already knew.
You knew that mother insisted on bringing the Star of Rhodesia with her to London?
And that while here an attempted has been made to steal it.
Did Scotland Yard tell you that?
Oh no my dear
Mr. Carstairs.
The fact that your mother owns the famous diamond is common knowledge.
She came down to London to attend the reception at Buckingham Palace, and quite naturally, wore the Star of Rhodesia.
You want me to accompany you back to your home in Edinburgh.
Therefore, an attempt must have been made to steal the Star of Rhodesia while you were here in London.
It seems simple the way you explain it, Mr. Holmes.
Thank you.
If you don't mind,
I'll wait here for my friend Doctor Watson.
I can't think what's keeping him.
Mother and I will be expecting you.
Oh could I take this for you?
Oh I'd be much obliged. Thank you.
We'll be in compartment 'E.'
Yes.
I thought it better to engage Mr. Holmes after what happened in London.
No doubt you're an efficient person but I don't think there's any need for a policeman.
Policeman?
How long have you been in possession of the Star of
Rhodesia, Lady Margaret?
Twenty-five years.
You know it may seem strange to you but I've never actually seen it.
I suppose there's no harm since we're paying you to guard it.
Mother?
Yes?
May I?
Do by all means.
Thank you.
Great Scott!
What a remarkable stone.
My husband gave it to me on our fifth wedding anniversary.
Four hundred and twenty-three carats isn't it?
The original diamond was over seven hundred carats.
Really?
Your father had it cut.
Less ostentatious.
Ostentatious, it's as big as a duck's head.
Watson please.
I'm sorry.
Thank you Lady Margaret.
We will be as unobtrusive as possible.
That will be a novelty from a policeman.
Now if you wouldn't mind telling us where are compartment is.
Oh I am sorry Mr. Holmes.
Oh thank you.
Lady Margaret.
Good night.
Impertinent's.
She called us policemen.
What's wrong with being a policeman?
Oh hello Lestrade.
Where are you going?
The inspector's going to Scotland to fish for salmon.
The season doesn't start for another month but you wouldn't know that would you?
Who says I'm going to fish for salmon?
Who?
Him.
Excuse me please.
Police.
Police?
Here?
On the train?
Scotland Yard I heard.
I warned you.
My dear fellow
I still insist the unpolished wild rice does make a considerable difference to a good curry.
Well I still can't agree with you.
Take care of this for me, will you Watson?
I shall old fellow.
That was one of them.
Was young Carstairs in the dining club with you?
No Lady Margaret came in alone.
Well I was in my compartment just now having a bite to eat and heard a crash in here.
Crash?
It's locked.
I knocked and there was no answer.
So you just stood here twiddling your thumbs?
Brilliant.
Attendant, will you please unlock this door?
I'm sorry sir, it's...
This is Inspector
Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
That's all right you can open it.
Very good sir.
Well.
Dead.
Murdered.
That's a bit quick isn't it, even for you?
Is this the a...
Yes.
The Star of Rhodesia was in this box not forty-five minutes ago.
How do you know?
I saw it.
Well it might be here somewhere.
No good looking for it Lestrade.
The killer's got it.
Awe, there you are Holmes.
How about joining us in the...
Take a look at this body, will you Watson?
Body?
Great Scott.
How do you know its murder, Mr. Holmes?
Murder?
Oh I say.
Who are you?
Major Duncan Bleek, a friend of
Doctor Watson's.
What makes you so sure it's murder, Mr. Holmes, the door was locked?
Every attendant has a key.
Did you open this door for anyone during the last hour?
No sir.
Was the key ever out of your possession?
It never is, sir.
It's on a chain.
Looks to me like heart failure.
Any marks of violence on the body?
None that I can see.
Seemed to of missed this time didn't you Mr. Holmes?
Possibly.
Still if it was a natural death it came at a very convenient time didn't it?
What does this mean?
Star of Rhodesia, it's gone.
You were supposed to guard it.
My son employed you.
That's why I left it with him.
Where is he?
I'm sorry Lady Margaret.
It's thoughtless of us to let you come in like this.
Do you have an empty compartment?
Yes sir.
Then I think we'd better if you don't mind
Lady Margaret, please.
Poor chaps mother I presume.
Yeah.
Well let's get to the bottom of this.
Well excuse me Doctor.
Poor chap, he was so young.
It's such a pity.
I have sent for the conductor, Lestrade.
You'll want to talk him and I've asked that no one be allowed to leave this coach.
Oh thank you Mr. Holmes.
Shall we use my compartment?
Attendant?
Lock that door and let no one go in without my permission, you understand?
Very good, sir.
Sorry old man, official police business.
Well that's all right
I'll catch up with you later.
Are you looking for the
Scotland Yard,
Inspector, sir?
Oh why yes.
Right in there.
Thank you.
Come in.
Sorry sir, no one's allowed to leave the carriage.
Can't leave the carriage, whose ridiculous idea was that?
Scotland Yard.
Scotland...
You say we don't stop until we reach Rugby?
That's right sir.
Good.
We'll have a thorough search of the train made before that time.
Find the murderer,
Inspector, and you'll find the diamond.
But we don't know it was murder.
Consider the facts, Lestrade.
Young Carstairs was dead when the jewel was taken, otherwise he'd of put up a struggle and there were no marks of violence on the body.
If, however, he died a natural death we must assume that the thief happened to be on hand just at the right moment, which is outside the realm of probability.
No Lestrade, in this case, nothing was left to chance.
That's why I say find the murderer and you'll find the diamond.
How do we know the thief didn't leave the carriage before we discovered the body?
The attendant was in the corridor the entire time and he's certain that no one passed into the dining car.
The door at the other end leads into the luggage van.
Which is always locked.
You found no marks of any kind on the body Watson?
No, none of any significance.
Not even a scratch?
Well there was a small spot of blood on his neck, just a mere speck.
That's what I was referring to.
You mean that scratch killed him?
It's possible the poison that went into the wound did.
Poison?
We can't tell that without an autopsy.
Have you got a list of passengers in this carriage?
Yes sir.
There you are sir.
Thank you.
Major Duncan Bleek that would be your friend Doctor.
The next compartments empty.
Where we took Lady
Margaret after the murder.
You remember Lestrade.
Go on.
Vivian Vedder, Inspector
Les... that's this one.
Lady Margaret Carstairs and the honorable
Roland Carstairs,
Professor
William Kilbane,
Mr. & Mrs.
Alfred Shawcross,
Mr. Holmes and
Doctor Watson.
That would be you two.
I think I shall ask a few questions.
Vivian Vedder, we'll start with her, whoever she is.
Vedder
Compartment 'C.'
Oh, here we are.
Empty.
Say Holmes are you going to let Lestrade handle this thing by himself?
Well after all he does represent the official police you know.
With him doing the questioning, looking under the seat cushions for diamonds, what very more must we do now?
I could do it better myself.
Why don't you old fellow?
Huh?
By Jove I think I will.
Probably find out just as much as Lestrade would anyway.
I'll do it at once.
That's where I just came from.
What is the meaning of this?
I'm sorry Ms. Vedder but it was necessary for us to search your compartment.
Indeed.
May I ask what you expected to find?
A valuable jewel has been stolen.
And a man has been murdered.
We're making a routine search of the entire carriage and asking a few questions.
Go right ahead.
I understand your journey is rather a sad one.
Your mother...
Yes.
Perhaps we better not question Ms. Vedder just now Lestrade.
Huh?
Excuse us will you?
What's the idea
Mr. Holmes?
It's a matter of taste Lestrade.
The young lady's taking her mother to Scotland for burial.
In a coffin?
That is the customary method I believe.
Lestrade I think we'll take a look at that coffin.
Might prove interesting.
I was about to suggest that very thing myself, Mr. Holmes.
Conductor, I'll have a look in the luggage van.
This way sir.
But I am Doctor Watson,
Doctor John H. Watson of 2-21 B Baker
Street, retired, my friend Sherlock
Holmes will vouch for it.
Your alibi isn't worth a Scotch.
You just told me that this fellow Holmes is a crony of yours, naturally he'd lie.
I resent that sir.
Sherlock Holmes is very full of integrity.
Might even be an accomplice.
Oh well if I were a policeman
I'd take you and charge this very moment.
I didn't do it sir.
I swear I didn't do it.
I can prove it.
Prove what...
There you are Holmes.
Now get out of here and join your silly friend!
Did you discover anything Watson?
Yes.
He's a very suspicious character.
He tried to put me off the scent.
From the little I heard he seemed reasonably successful.
Look here, you're not going to let an old fellow like
Professor Kilbane discourage you are you?
Why don't you try this one?
You think I'd better?
Yes of course.
All right.
Do you mind if I come in?
You may.
Thank you.
I'm sorry to bother you but
I represent the police.
I knew it.
Alfred I told you.
Told him what?
Well?
It's quite all right Inspector.
I confess.
Confess?
You mean you stole it?
You got it in there?
Yes.
No no no,
Leave it where it is.
I've got to fetch
Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
And don't either of you attempt to run away.
Oh no, Inspector.
Is this door always kept locked Conductor?
Yes sir.
Only the guard and myself have keys.
Got him Holmes.
Who?
The thieves.
Thieves?
There, come on, speak up.
That married couple down there.
Mr. & Mrs. Shawcross?
Yes they confessed.
Broke them down.
Gave them the third degree.
And you left them unguarded?
I told them not to run away.
We'd better have a talk with them.
Oh it's you again.
It might interest you to know that I've just caught the thieves.
Excuse me madam.
You are the police, I know.
I warned him but no he had to take it.
I must warn you that anything you say may be used against you.
Anything they say?
They've already admitted everything.
Everything?
Yes.
They've got it in there.
I'd be glad to pay double what it's worth if only they won't prosecute.
It's my first offense.
You chaps always say the same thing.
Come on hand it over.
Where is it?
I stole it.
I took it from a hotel in London.
Come on, come on.
In my small way
I'm a collector of teapots.
Teapots!
Doctor Watson does this look like a diamond?
Not very much now that you mention it.
What's that all about a confession?
When I came in here before they said that they took it.
Well you'll please oblige to stop meddling in police business.
His time wasn't entirely wasted Lestrade, at least you've recovered the teapot.
Thank you Holmes.
Teapot.
Fellow tries his best and what's he get?
Humiliation and abuse from Lestrade of all people.
I have a good mind to chuck off the whole case.
Might be a good idea to let the police do their own work.
You mind your own business.
Oh there you are Watson, how about a spot in my compartment?
Thanks old man.
Serve them right if
I got a bit tiddly.
I suppose you realize you'll be turned over to the police as soon as we reach Edinburgh.
Doctor Watson, teapots!
I beg your pardon
Professor Kilbane; you're in the next compartment aren't you?
I am.
I'm afraid we'll have to ask you a few questions.
Now don't tell me that you're going to start.
Do you mind?
Why of course mind.
Come on, in you go.
A brilliant mind in times when...
When your scientist mind has shown him the way?
Exactly.
You take the death of young Carstairs, for instance.
I knew from the first it was poison.
The scientific approach of course.
The murderer used a hypodermic.
Some rare poison from, from South
America probably.
Or India.
Yes or India.
I've been to India.
So have you.
Yes sir.
Yes of course.
You've been to India.
I don't like your attitude
Professor Kilbane,
I don't like it at all.
Perhaps not, but I'm on this train for legitimate reasons and I've neither the time nor the inclination to assist you with your work.
You're perfectly within in your right sir and I'm sure that
Inspector Lestrade appreciates that.
Thank you sir.
Now if you have no objection
I have some work to do, which requires concentration.
Mathematics?
Yes.
Interesting study.
If you don't mind.
Looking for something
Lady Margaret?
Oh.
I came to get my bag.
The door's locked.
Naturally.
Perhaps I can help you.
Thank you.
Mr. Holmes
I must talk to you about the diamond.
Oh don't you worry about that Lady Margaret.
Fifty thousand pounds and you tell me not to worry.
My son employed this man to guard it and it was stolen right under his very nose.
I warn you,
I intend to take this matter up with your superiors.
I'm a private agent,
Lady Margaret.
Good.
I shall report you both to Scotland Yard.
But I am Scotland Yard.
Lady Carstairs entered the dining car alone.
You and I were already there.
Holmes came in later and I understand that
Inspector Lestrade remained in his compartment with the curtains open so that if anyone had gone in or out he would have seen them?
Say, you've got something there.
Well let's look at this thing objectively.
Lady Carstairs seemed more concerned, was more concerned, at the loss of the diamond than at the death of her son.
By George you're right.
So she was.
Come in.
Oh here you are Watson.
Sit down.
Have a drink?
No thanks.
Do you mind if I...
Not at all.
I've been thinking about this case Holmes, that is Duncan
Bleek and I have.
Yes so I see.
The way we figure it out, the old trout is the only one without an alibi.
Yes, we feel that you're approaching the whole thing from the wrong angle.
Really Watson?
What's your theory?
Insurance.
A lot of people insure jewelry and then try and collect on it.
Interesting suggestion.
I suppose you go and ask Lady Margaret just how much insurance she carries on the Star of Rhodesia.
No thank you.
I've already had two tries.
Why don't you ask her yourself?
For a very simple reason, I already know.
You're quite a doodler sir.
If you know why did you ask me.
Mr. and Mrs. Shawcross.
Teapots.
Well we can eliminate them.
Professor William Kilbane.
I'll send a telegram to the Edinburgh Police to check up on that mathematics professor.
Interesting.
Now what?
Well just a coincidence.
What's a coincidence?
The fact that this fellow Kilbane, happens to be a professor of mathematics.
Oh.
Come again Mr. Holmes.
Lestrade did you ever hear of
Colonel Sebastian Moran?
Well of course I did.
What about him?
Well then as you know,
Colonel Sebastian Moran was the most sinister, ruthless and diabolic, clever henchmen of our late but unlamented friend,
Professor Moriarity.
I've never seen him but I've been conscious of his presence more than once.
As a matter of fact, he was directly responsible for what very nearly turned out to be my premature death on three separate occasions.
Very pretty, Mr. Holmes, what's all that got to do with all this?
Possibly nothing.
However, his specialty was spectacular jewel robberies and for relaxation he was addicted to the study of mathematics.
Are you referring that this Professor Kilbane is Colonel
Sebastian Moran?
That he murdered young Carstairs and stole the diamond?
Well what about this woman, this Vivian Vedder, what about her?
No one's above suspicion.
And Lady Margaret, she might have a motive for wanting the Star of Rhodesia stolen.
She wasn't very concerned over the death of her son.
And this friend of
Doctor Watson's, this Major Duncan Bleek, might suggest it's sensible to suspect him.
No.
As far as we know only four persons knew the Star of Rhodesia was on this train, yourself,
Doctor Watson, the murdered... the dead lad and myself.
And Lady Margaret.
I'll have another talk with her ladyship.
Lady Margaret do you mind if I come in?
Well Holmes?
You can leave it open, will you?
Lucky beggar.
Who's a lucky beggar?
Duncan Bleek.
Been playing cards with him.
He won all the way across, however the expression is.
Have you been with him all this time?
Yeah, just left him.
He introduced me to a new fangled game.
Gin Rummy he called it.
It's American I believe.
Sort of bookkeeping connected with it.
You ever hear of it?
Still looking for the murderer, Inspector?
Impossible fellow.
Vanished into thin air.
There you are.
Where on Earth have you been?
I asked you where'd you been.
Well what's happened?
I've been observing the landscape from the dark end of the corridor.
I just been along there,
I didn't see you.
The door was shut.
Naturally
I was on the outside.
The outside?
Yes.
You must try it sometime.
Lets go take a look at that coffin.
Do you remember
I was interrupted the last time?
Sorry.
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
Do you mind if I inspect the coffin you're taking to Scotland?
No one is allowed in here Mr. Holmes.
I'll take the responsibility, excuse me.
Did it ever occur to you Watson that this is a very unusual coffin?
I don't know, a trifle ornate perhaps.
I wasn't thinking of the fittings as the... do you mind if we open it?
It's forbidden sir.
Sorry.
Come on Watson.
But you can't do that sir.
We'll have to.
Excuse me please.
Poor old lady.
As I thought.
Swallow.
The body only comes down to about here.
Well you think there's a secret compartment underneath?
There has to be.
Empty.
Yes but it's been recently occupied.
Lets ask Lestrade to come in here he's with Lady Margaret.
Right back Holmes.
Have you let anyone else in here?
No.
Mathematics hey?
Gives me something to do.
Come quick.
What is it?
It's the coffin.
Holmes found a false bottom in it.
There's enough room for the murderer to hide in.
What is all this Mr. Holmes?
There's where your murderer's been hiding Lestrade.
Then it's just a question of finding him isn't it Mr. Holmes?
Not him, them.
Huh?
This affair's obviously the work of two men.
The one who planned and the other who hid in the coffin and at prearranged time emerged to commit the murder and affect the robbery.
What are you talking about?
Colonel Sebastian Moran.
You got that man on the brain Mr. Holmes.
My dear Lestrade,
I accepted this case because I was virtually certain that Colonel
Sebastian Moran could not resist such a tempting morsel as the Star of Rhodesia.
I'm convinced that he's the brains behind this case and that he's on this train.
Oh and how would you go about finding out, which one of the passenger's is this Colonel
Sebastian Moran?
If he is one of the passengers.
Well I suggest you start by questioning Ms. Vedder.
It might prove interesting.
Huh?
Oh.
Who's there?
Ms. Vedder, I want to ask you a few questions and I must warn you, anything you say may be used against you.
Oh?
Now about your mother.
It isn't your mother after all is it?
Perhaps if you explain.
That coffin, we've examined it.
And found the secret compartment.
Oh come on, let's have it.
Have what?
Your story.
If you insist.
A man approached me and ask me to take a coffin to Scotland.
He offered me a hundred pounds.
Were you aware that the coffin had a secret compartment?
I was.
What story did this person tell you to account for a man being concealed in the coffin?
That someone had to leave London.
Foreign agents were watching the trains.
Foreign agents.
All right.
Maybe I didn't believe that foreign agent story.
You realize, of course, this makes you an accomplice?
What was the name of the man who approached you?
I don't remember.
Ms. Vedder, the man who engaged you to take this coffin to Scotland was it by any chance this man here?
I say old man aren't you making a mistake?
My dear Watson, just what do you know about Major Duncan Bleek?
I've known him for years.
He's a member of my club.
I say is this a joke?
Does the name,
Colonel Moran, mean anything to you sir?
Colonel Moran?
Yes, Colonel
Sebastian Moran.
Why I'm afraid it doesn't.
Good heavens you don't think that I...
No no no of course not, you have the perfect alibi,
Doctor Watson.
Yes yes yes of course.
Good heavens gentlemen, you are at perfect liberty to search my compartment or to search me.
And if you find the diamond I...
No that won't be necessary.
The Star of Rhodesia has not been stolen.
What's that Mr. Holmes?
An imitation was stolen
I have the real one.
You've got it?
My dear Lestrade, surely you didn't think
I would allow
Lady Margaret to retain the genuine diamond.
When I felt reasonably certain that an attempt would be made to steal it
I have had it in my possession almost from the moment
I boarded the train.
Confound it, Mr. Holmes, you had no right to do that.
This is a police matter come on let me have it.
My job was to see that it wasn't stolen, it wasn't.
Look I don't know what this is all about but I do know that
I never seen this gentleman before in my life.
I shall have to ask you to remain in your compartment until we reach Edinburgh.
Inspector Lestrade?
Huh?
Telegram for you sir.
Thank you.
Sorry old man,
I'm afraid my friend owes you an apology.
Oh that's all right Watson.
In a case like this naturally everyone is suspected.
Oh we all make mistakes, even Holmes is not infallible and after all the killer is still at large you know?
Yes he is isn't he?
Well good night.
Good night, oh boy, don't worry.
I think I'll have another little chat with that professor fellow.
Something important Lestrade?
You have your secrets,
Mr. Holmes, I have mine.
This is Inspector
Lestrade.
Look here, is this racket going to continue all night?
Professor Kilbane you told me you were on the staff of the University of Edinburgh.
I said nothing of the kind.
You most certainly did, I heard you.
Mr. Holmes here heard you.
I merely said that I was a professor of mathematics and that I was returning to my home in Edinburgh.
Well it might be necessary to talk to you again, later.
You come pounding on this door again and I'll have the law on you.
I am the law.
Then stop barging in and out of my room like a chambermaid.
Where is everybody?
Sorry chap.
Doesn't want to open the door probably.
This should help us.
Who shut that door?
Great Scott the guard.
The murderer came back to the scene.
Hypodermic.
Look again old fellow.
Scratch, just a scratch.
Like the one on
Ronald Carstairs.
A small dart apparently made with some soluble substance.
Probably a gelatin preparation that melts in the wound.
That's why you couldn't see anything on Carstairs.
The murderer was about to get rid of the body and heard the knock and became frightened.
Here let me have that will you?
Come away from that door.
Were you seen coming in here?
No.
Sherlock Holmes and the fat bloke are in the luggage van now.
How about the guard in the corridor?
He didn't see me.
I fixed him temporarily.
Guard in the van dead.
I had to kill him.
Here you'd better take this.
This isn't the
Star of Rhodesia.
You wouldn't be trying to double cross me would you?
Sherlock Holmes got the diamond and replaced it with this imitation.
Now that Scotland
Yard Inspector has the real Star of Rhodesia.
Was he with Holmes and
Watson in the luggage van?
No.
Good then he's probably in his compartment.
But you'll have to hurry.
I don't like it.
Neither do I.
All you have to do is to relieve him of the diamond.
Scotland Yard
Inspector why that... that's something different.
Naturally it will be more money for you, you'd like that wouldn't you?
Come on.
He's in there.
He's got the diamond.
You use this.
No.
No don't shoot.
No don't shoot.
Hello.
That fellow you put on guard isn't there.
So I've observed.
Strange.
What is?
Lestrade!
Here.
Help me to get him up on to this seat.
He's coming to.
Hand me that water, will you?
Oh it's nothing very serious.
I'll attend to him properly later on.
Poisoned like the others.
It's gone.
The diamond's gone.
Gone?
Yeah.
Hadn't we better search the murderer at once?
It's no use old fellow, the man who killed him has the Star of Rhodesia.
What's this?
It's an air pistol Lestrade that fires a poison dart.
It's quite an unusual design.
You were attacked because you had the diamond.
Fortunately this wasn't used on you.
We're coming to a stop.
Police.
Scottish police.
I don't feel up to it Mr. Holmes, would you be good enough to talk to them?
Certainly.
Thank you.
You keep quiet old boy.
Be back in a minute.
Mr. Holmes, this is
Inspector Macdonald with the Edinburgh police.
How do you do?
I happen to be in this district on another case and I received this telegram from headquarters.
You will want to talk to Inspector Lestrade.
In due time but
I'm in charge here.
This is Scotland you've crossed the border.
We've had a spot of trouble here Inspector.
That's why I'm here.
And who are you might I ask?
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
The private inquiry agent hey?
I've heard of you.
Heard of him?
Mr. Holmes has practically solved this case already.
Watson
Will you clear the dining car
I want to ask a few questions.
Yes sir.
And see that no one leaves this compartment until I need him for questioning.
Very good sir.
Inspector Lestrade asked me to sit in with you.
It's a bit unusual but...
Scotland Yard thinks a great deal of Sherlock Holmes.
They frequently ask his advice.
Scotland Yard hey?
Where is this
Inspector Lestrade?
Now Watson will you see if Inspector Lestrade has sufficiently recovered to come into the dining car?
Right you are.
Ms. Vedder, I know all about you and frankly you're in for it.
All I did was buy a coffin and bring it on the train.
In my opinion this is a matter for Scotland Yard.
Scotland Yard's jurisdiction ended when you crossed the border Inspector.
So you say.
That's a matter of opinion.
Ms. Vedder's unquestionably in the plot.
But you may not know
Colonel Moran however.
I don't.
Colonel Sebastian Moran?
Is he in this?
You know him?
Unfortunately I do.
You may return to your compartment.
You said unfortunately.
I once had an encounter with Colonel Moran.
The only time in my entire career
I've been bestead.
The cleverest criminal since the late
Professor Moriarity.
And that I can concur.
Where is this
Sebastian Moran?
He's traveling on this train under the name of
Major Duncan Bleek.
What on Earth are you talking about?
Are you serious
Mr. Holmes?
Constable, bring in Duncan Bleek.
Aye sir.
Duncan Bleek?
But he paid for the gentleman at Lords.
Come in.
Duncan Bleek?
Yes.
Inspector Macdonald would like to see you.
All right.
Colonel Sebastian
Moran hey?
It will give me great pleasure, Mr. Holmes, to meet up with that scoundrel again.
You wanted to see me?
Yes Colonel Moran, you're under arrest.
So you've managed to convince them that I'm the mythical
Colonel Moran?
Not mythical Colonel.
Have you forgotten that affair at Inverness three years ago?
I've never been to
Inverness in my life.
Do you mind if
I search you?
Go ahead.
For an innocent man, you carry strange things in your pockets.
A retired Army officer, India.
But you're in
Scotland now and there's a law against carrying firearms.
Well you satisfied?
Not quite Colonel.
Now I'm satisfied.
This clears things up pretty well.
You'll be coming into
Topham in a few minutes.
The train doesn't stop at Topham I'm afraid.
I'm afraid you're wrong this time Holmes.
This train will stop at Topham.
You're only delaying the inevitable Colonel Moran.
You can't get away.
Out of the way Inspector.
All right Inspector
Macdonald here's your man.
Who pulled that cord?
It's all right Conductor, we get off here with our prisoner.
Constable take him off.
That was quite a struggle
Inspector Macdonald.
Good work Mr. Holmes.
Perhaps I underestimated you.
Was it you who hit me?
Oh I'm terribly sorry.
You must accept my apologies.
Well that's it.
Where's Lestrade?
Look under that table over there.
Is that Lestrade?
Great Scot its
Duncan Bleek.
You mean Colonel
Sebastian Moran.
Come on old fellow give me a hand.
What's all this about?
Where's Inspector
Macdonald?
He's just got off the train.
He couldn't have.
He couldn't.
Oh but he has.
A very clever plot
Colonel Moran.
You're henchmen masquerading as policemen come aboard the train, arrest you, stop the train and take you off.
But this is fantastic.
Yes it is isn't it?
And it's a scheme worthy of Colonel
Sebastian Moran.
He planned the whole thing including the coffin with the secret compartment in case anything went wrong.
The pseudo policeman to come aboard and take him off the train before it reached
Edinburgh.
Then where is Lestrade?
Well I imagine at the moment he's pretty well occupied.
Just a minute Macdonald.
Get over there all of you you're under arrest.
Now put up your hands.
Driver take us to the nearest police station.
Come on get over here.
Then the poke in the eye
I received from
Sherlock Holmes wasn't an accident after all?
That is a matter of opinion.
Come on get in.
Send it over as soon as possible will you?
Very good sir.
It's a telegram to the real Edinburgh police asking to meet us when we arrive.
But how did you know this fellow wasn't the real
Inspector Macdonald?
Elementary my dear Watson.
In the first place, he didn't put handcuffs on Colonel Moran so I had to do it myself and in the second place,
Inspector Macdonald, during the fight, was more hindrance than help, which is not characteristic of a real policeman.
Amazing Holmes.
Uncovering such a plot with so little evidence.
Yes I forgot to mention that I also happen to know the real Inspector
Macdonald of the Edinburgh Police.
Oh was Lestrade in all of this?
Yes and surprisingly enough he grasped the situation immediately.
That's very unusual.
Let's hope he hasn't overdone it.
Very clever Holmes.
You've got me but you haven't got the
Star of Rhodesia.
Oh but I have.
If in the dark
I could substitute a big hulk like Lestrade for you Colonel Moran.
It's no very great feat to switch a little thing like a diamond.
Shh, he's here.
You gentlemen look like educated men of good taste.
I have here some rare old first editions.
He's not bothering us.
I'm interested in his books.
Okay.
Now here are the complete works of William Shakespeare, an old German writer.
I like that.
We move tonight.
Orders from Berlin.
Dr. Tobel is to be across the border before dawn.
But we'd had orders not to break into his house and he hides there.
Hasn't been outside in weeks.
The Fuhrer wants no trouble with Switzerland at this moment.
We must be very careful.
If we can't break in, he won't come out?
When the Fuhrer needs something as badly as he needs the
Tobel bomb sight there is always a way.
Dr. Tobel is interested in my scientific volumes.
He's see my forged papers and he believes I come from Yudthem.
No gentlemen.
The price is much too low.
I could not possibly sell such a rare book for such a price.
I will induced Dr. Tobel to come and visit to my shop.
It's the fastest way.
You're interested in this book, a rare old set of
Bismarck papers.
One last warning.
I've just had word from Berlin.
The English spy hunter will try to take Dr. Tobel from under our very eyes.
They are sending a stupid bumbling amateur detective.
His name is
Holmes, or Homes or some such foolishness.
He'll never escape from Switzerland alive.
Now quick.
Get me thrown out of here and watch for my signal from Dr. Tobel's window.
But gentlemen you promised to buy one of books.
I told you no.
Ah, stop bothering us.
They are not so great prices.
[Arguing in French]
French, English, how
I hate those languages.
Calm yourself my dear brother.
In a short time there will be only one language.
Good evening, Dr. Tobel.
I have here some very interesting scientific books.
I thought you might like to see them.
Please come in.
He's entering the house.
Quickly, get the car and have the motor running.
I will follow.
We'll have the Tobel bomb sight to the Fuhrer while this Holmes is still having his tea.
What are you doing?
I am sorry but for months every move I have made has been watched.
I am not a coward,
Mr. Holmes.
They won't watch you anymore.
Tonight they intend to take you forcibly across the German border.
Then why do we wait here doing nothing like rats in a trap.
Calm yourself my dear Dr. Tobel.
We should not only escape their trap but we should also take the cheese away with us.
But, but how?
The four sections of your bomb sight fit inside these ponderous tombs, although I must confess that I shy to the thought of disembowelling a complete set of
Charles Dickens.
Ah, but you cannot hide me in a hollow book.
My dear fellow.
I'm sorry that my good friend
Dr. Watson isn't here to explain to you that are my preparations are never slipshot.
Stephan, Eric.
Why do you call my servants?
Your servants, yes, but tonight they assume new roles.
Let me present Dr. Tobel and our old friend, the bookseller.
Holmes, it is so simple.
Yes, the obvious always appears simple.
Quick now.
We must leave.
Stephan, the knapsack.
Stephan, and Eric are proving excellent decoys.
And the Gestapo has been fooled?
Completely.
The servants are leading them into the next street.
But what will happen to Stephan and Eric?
Nothing, don't worry.
I've taken care of that.
Away from here.
Come on quick.
Do you want to take the Nazis own car?
One must adept oneself to the tools at hand.
You think you've made them believe you're a harmless old bookseller.
Yes, I've always felt that a thorough knowledge of the classics might come in handy.
But how can we get across the border and through France?
There's no need to get across.
This very moment a
Royal Air Force plane is waiting for us at the secret landing place.
How long before we arrive in London?
In a very few minutes.
We're passing over Dover now.
Thank you.
You'll have to get used to our London blackouts Dr. Tobel.
Ah.
Huh?
Dr. Watson is a very untidy fellow.
And what, what are we going to do with, with these?
A problem of the most elementary nature, my dear Dr. Tobel.
You arent going to keep them here.
And I have always believed in the theory originally projected by Edgar Allen Poe, the American writer, that the best place to hide anything is where everyone can see it.
Yes, but...
You will remember no doubt in Poes story "The
Purloined Letter".
And the missing in question was always in plain view.
Hands up, gentlemen.
Scotland Yard, quick.
Oh, my goodness.
Good evening, Mrs. Hudson.
Oh, why it's Mr. Holmes.
Holmes!
Hello Watson old fellow, it's good to see you again.
Telephone.
Huh?
Who do you want?
Oh yes, you're
Scotland Yard.
I'm afraid there's been a little mistake.
No need to get angry.
We all make mistakes at times.
What?
Well if we didn't you'd be out of a job.
Dr. Tobel, this is my friend and associate and as you may observed my watchdog, Dr. Watson.
How do you do, sir?
How do you do?
Dr. Tobel and I flew in from Zurich this evening.
You can put that thing away now, Watson.
Dr. Tobel awarded the maximum request for physics in 1939.
My dear Watson, there is only one Dr. Tobel.
Without Mr. Holmes there would have been no
Dr. Tobel I am afraid.
But I thought you were living in America sir.
I have been working in Switzerland for the past two years.
And Holmes got you out?
In the nick of time.
There was not a point he overlooked.
Every contingency was foreseen and provided for.
It was magnificent.
Thank you, doctor.
The problem was not without its interesting points.
Is there anything you would like, Mr. Holmes?
No thank you, Mrs. Hudson.
You can go to bed now.
He gave me an awful fright dressed up like that.
Well good night, sir.
She's quite right.
You can't blame me for jumping to the conclusions I did.
You looked like a broken down musician.
Holmes, why didn't you take your fiddle with you?
I never did think much of this dressing up business.
It was necessary,
I assure you.
The Gestapo was close on our heels.
Really?
This is Sherlock Holmes.
I want to speak to Sir
Reginald Bailey please.
Reginald Bailey?
Is that the fellow who played rugby for Black Heath?
Yes, Watson.
Oh.
Hello, Sir Reginald?
Holmes speaking.
Yes, from Bakers Street.
I have Dr. Tobel with me.
Well thank you.
Very well then, I'll meet you in half an hour.
And there must be no delay.
I'll arrange with Sir Reginald to have the test tomorrow morning.
I suggest that only cabinet ministers and your best aviation experts be present.
Naturally.
Watson, I leave
Dr. Tobel in your care.
Give him a sedative.
This has been strenuous business and he has a long day ahead of him again tomorrow.
Certainly Holmes, of course.
He shall sleep in my bedroom.
I'll keep watch till you return.
Thank you.
It is not necessary to guard me.
I am quite safe now.
Safe Dr. Tobel?
I shouldn't count on it for a second.
But Mr. Holmes...
A great deal may depend on your safety and the enemy understands that just as well as we do.
Good night.
Keep alert, Watson.
Yes, sir, of course.
A couple of these and you'll sleep peacefully through a blitz.
Thank you.
You better start undressing at once or you'll find yourself fast asleep in the middle of taking off your trousers.
Well I'll sit over here and keep an eye on things.
Oh by the way, if you're nervous call out.
Good night, doctor.
Good night, doctor.
Well funny I was saying the same thing at the same time.
Good night, doctor.
Good night, doctor.
Untidy fellow, Holmes.
Hello?
Yes, I just arrived about an hour ago.
It is most important that I see you at once.
No, no.
I cannot explain.
It is now five minutes past midnight.
I leave at once.
Goodbye.
Holmes, I don't have to tell you how much this means to us.
We'll know a great deal more about the bomb sight after the demonstration,
Sir Reginald.
You always have a pretty good idea of the value of the Tobel bomb sight, just as the Nazis have.
However.
Oh, if you care to place
Dr. Tobel under the protection of Scotland
Yard until tomorrow.
No, no, no.
No, that won't be necessary.
I shall personally deliver Dr. Tobel to your representatives on Salisbury Plain in plenty of time for the demonstration.
Thank you.
Good night, Sir Reginald.
Good night, Mr. Holmes.
Charlotte Eberli, Flat B.
Right.
Get the car, ready.
I'll wait here until he comes out.
Is that what the
Americans call doodling?
It is more serious than you could possibly realize, Charlotte.
Good.
More coffee?
No, thank you, darling.
I must get back before they miss me.
We've been separated for so long.
I couldn't bear that anything should part us again.
I want to work with you and I want to know every minute where you are.
Even for you to know the details of my mission in London is to sign your death warrant.
If you are in real danger
I want to share it.
There is one thing you can do.
Guard this envelope.
If anything happens to me see that it reaches the hands of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Yes.
I pray I never have to deliver it.
Help!
He got away.
Are you all right, sir?
I, I think so.
It must have been a robber.
Yeah, since the blackouts those have become quite a nuisance, sir.
Uhhh.
I say you better come with me and have that fixed up.
Uhh, thank you.
Just lean on my arm.
Watson.
Watson, wake up.
Huh?
Where's Tobel.
He, he, he's there.
No he isn't.
He's gone.
That's impossible.
He's asleep in my bed.
I've been here the whole time.
If anything's happened to him.
Tobel, you all right?
Ahh, it is nothing.
Yes.
Sit down here.
Let's have a look.
Well it doesn't look too bad.
Who patched you up, the police doctor?
Yes.
It looks as if you've been attacked.
Obviously, my dear Watson.
Dr. Tobel, do you suspect the woman of arranging the trap?
Woman, What woman?
She's blonde.
Five foot six, full lipped and very affectionate.
Oh really?
You've known her for a long time.
You were attacked after leaving her apartment.
Holmes, how do you know this?
The face powder around your coat tells me of her height and her affection for you.
You held her close before departing.
Huh.
It's all there for the trained eye to read, Watson?
But look here.
Why couldn't he have been attacked on his way to the woman's apartment?
The mark of the blow has erased some of the powder.
Obviously if the attack came first the powder would have remained undisturbed.
And the full lips that was a guess.
I never guess, Watson.
You have rubbed the lipstick from your face with a handkerchief you now hold in your hand and that amount of lipstick never came from a pair of thin lips.
And the blonde hair?
Good gracious me.
Mr. Holmes, I am glad you are on my side.
Well in that case you will desist from disobeying my orders and slipping out while your bodyguard sleeps his watch away.
It won't happen again, Holmes.
I was sitting in front of the fire and must have dozed.
All right, All right.
Oh, sorry.
Now, can you describe your assailant?
I never saw him.
A great figure came at me in the dark.
I felt a stunning blow on my head and, and instantly fingers were at my throat.
But you must have noticed something about him.
Think man.
A thing of little consequence to you may mean a great deal to me.
Wait.
Wait a moment.
There was one thing.
Long fingers at my throat like, like steel.
And then, then a, an odor, a heavy drug-like odor.
A drug?
Opium?
That is it.
I am sure of it now.
Well, I suggest we get the remains of a good night sleep.
Remember, the test takes place tomorrow morning on Salisbury Plain.
The principal of
Dr. Tobel's device involves the use of three sonic beams.
Is that right, sir?
That appears to be it.
There he is.
We're on the course now, sir.
Well gentlemen, that load would sink any ship in the world.
We must consider the possibility of good piloting and a lucky hit.
I'd like to see another try of it.
So would I.
They want you to try again, sir.
He's coming into position now, sir.
We're on the course now, sir.
Well gentlemen, how do you like the bomb sight now?
It's marvelous.
We'll revolutionize the aerial bombardment.
Inspector Lestrade.
Yes, Sir Reginald?
I hope Scotland Yard is taking every precaution to guard Dr. Tobel and his equipment.
Two plain-clothes men ride with him in his car sir, and four others follow in another one, sir.
Good.
He's coming to my office in Whitehall as soon as he lands.
Well shall we start, gentlemen?
Well, here he is gentlemen.
Congratulations sir.
It was excellent amazing performance.
It was magnificent,
Dr. Tobel.
Magnificent.
I am glad we had such ideal conditions for the test.
I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself.
We've been through a lot, Holmes but thank goodness he's safe now.
You brought your apparatus with you?
No, Sir Reginald.
I did not.
But why not?
It must be lodged in the most impregnable vault in this building until we're ready to start manufacture.
I have arranged for a little office of my own.
I intend to supervise the manufacture myself.
But you, you offered it to our government for our use.
Everything
Mr. Holmes has done has been with that ideal in view.
I still offer it to your government but no one else will know the secrets involved.
I have devised the plan to guard my invention, a plan as intricate as the bomb sight itself.
If you imagined for one moment...
Please.
I will not change my mind, Sir Reginald.
I am taking the matter into my own hands.
Just what do you propose to do, Dr. Tobel.
I am sorry.
I cannot reveal the details of my plan for the present.
Do you think that's wise?
I regret gentlemen.
I cannot change my decision.
I shall work independently.
Can't you persuade him, Holmes?
But supposing something should happen to you, Dr. Tobel.
You know, there's already been one attempt on your life.
And if Holmes' suspicions are right?
Quiet, Watson.
There is no use discussing it, gentlemen.
My mind is made up.
Scotland Yard will redouble the guard about you doctor.
In fact we'll quadruple it.
That is just what I do not wish done, inspector.
That would only draw attention to my activities.
Good day gentlemen.
Just the same I'll have my men watching him every moment from now on.
No, no, Wait Lestrade.
We must not offend Dr. Tobel.
We must remember that he, as a citizen of Switzerland, is under no obligation to give us his invention.
We must do as he asks.
Now don't you agree, Holmes?
But sure, Sir Reginald.
I'm not officially connected with the government and I intend to remain on the case.
Good, good.
That is if Inspector
Lestrade doesn't mind.
Not at all, Mr. Holmes.
We're always glad to have you hanging around.
Thank you.
You can put those away now, Lestrade.
Hoffner, I am entrusting this to you because first of all you are a Swiss and second there is no doubt in my mind of your ability.
I am honored Dr. Tobel.
I have divided the mechanism of my invention into four units.
Each is meaningless without the others.
You have delivered the other three.
Yes.
No one but myself knows the identity of the four scientists working on the four units.
Their names are not even known to each other.
I think I understand.
From what you tell me it will be easy to reproduce the unit assigned to me at any quantity you wish.
I knew I could rely on you.
I will get in touch with you as soon as I have made the rest of my arrangements.
No, no, no.
The back door if you please, Professor Hoffner.
Au vaus.
Au vaus.
Hello.
Yes, Lestrade.
Oh.
Very well.
What is it, Holmes?
Just as I feared.
Lestrade's men report that Tobel is missing.
Missing?
Yes, I was afraid of this.
How long has he been missing?
Practically since he walked out of your office yesterday.
If he'd only given the address of this place
I shouldn't have had to waste so much time finding it.
Empty.
The bomb sight's gone.
I didn't expect to find here, Sir Reginald.
This is a pretty mess.
If you knew this was going to happen why the devil didn't you do something about it?
You can rely on Holmes implicitly, Sir Reginald.
Tobel is gone and heaven alone knows where.
It serves me right for listening to that half-brained idea of his,
Dismissing Lestrade's men and they went leaving him here alone and unguarded.
Holmes, if anything has happened to Tobel, if his invention falls into the hands of Germany, it will be a major disaster for England.
Christmas wrapping.
He did his
Christmas shopping in plenty of time.
Yes, curious.
Do you, do you note something, Holmes?
Scent.
Perfume.
Yes.
I noticed it the moment we entered the room.
Claire de Luna.
One of the rarer essences and very expensive.
That woman again.
Undoubtedly.
Get me Inspector Lestrade.
Sherlock Holmes calling.
So Holmes is finally stumped.
First time I've heard him call for help.
Call for help indeed.
He's only just beginning his investigation.
Lestrade?
This is Holmes.
Check the records and place a call made on my private telephone of Bakers Street approximately twelve o'clock on the night of Dr. Tobel's arrival in London.
Finally stumped, hey Sir Reginald.
Yes, Lestrade?
Wait a minute.
Charlotte Eberli,
St. George's Street,
Flat B.
Excellent, Lestrade.
Thank you.
Where is Dr. Tobel?
I can't tell you.
You mean you won't tell me?
I don't know.
How many
Christmas packages did you take to him, Ms. Eberli?
Five.
He dismantled his bomb sight and packed the units in four of the boxes.
Is that correct?
Pardon me.
Hello.
Yes.
This is Miss Eberli.
Why, why someone must have stolen it.
On Richmond Bypass?
Yes.
Yes, I'll arrange to have it removed.
Yes.
At once.
Now I can be frank with you, Mr. Holmes.
Dr. Tobel has disappeared.
They found my car on
Richmond Bypass wrecked.
I loaned it to him last night.
For what purpose,
Miss Eberli?
He wouldn't tell me, but he said that if anything should happen to him
I was to give you this.
Holmes?
Then he must have expected something.
Yes.
This envelope has been opened and resealed.
But that is in impossible.
It hasn't been out of my hands.
What?
Why that's not the message.
It isn't even the same paper.
I saw Dr. Tobel draw little sets of figures.
What kind of figures?
Well they, they looked like little dancing men.
Dancing men?
That's curious.
Who's been in this apartment since Dr. Tobel entrusted that envelope to your care?
Why no one.
I've had no visitors.
Think.
Possibly a tradesman.
No.
Only the one for a few minutes.
And that one?
A workman.
He came to fix my light switch.
He couldn't have possibly...
Did you send for him?
Why no.
My lights went out and soon afterwards he knocked at my door and told me the porter had sent him up.
That's where he worked.
But he wasn't alone in this room more than five minutes and he did fix the lights.
They went on again.
The switch hasn't been touched.
The paint still covers the screw heads.
He simply threw the main switch in the basement, pretended to work on this one and after a few moments an accomplice threw the main switch back on.
But in those few minutes
- Did you get a look at his face?
No, only a glance.
Now I realize he kept his face averted.
But he was a large man?
Yes, he was large.
His eyes, heavy lidded, a thin film over the pupils.
And Holmes...
I remember now.
His eyes, they were like a snake's.
Miss Eberli,
Dr. Tobel is being held by one of the most brilliant men in the history of crime.
Come on, Watson.
There isn't a moment to lose.
Goodbye Miss Eberli.
Goodbye Miss Eberli.
I don't see why I'm not allowed to go with you.
You have your own mission, Watson.
Yes, to take a sealed note to Inspector Lestrade while you search through holes.
I shall not be searching for him.
I shall permit him to find me in the character of a murderous lascar once in his employ and whom I may add is still in jail.
Yes, but after all these years.
Make no mistake, Watson.
This is not a duel of intellects or the cruel but single-minded
Gestapo killer.
This is our greatest problem with England as the stake and our antagonist,
Professor Moriarity.
You've got to beat him.
Once he's behind bars
I think I shall entitle my memoirs of these adventures the end of Moriarity.
An excellent title, Watson, but we must arrange that it isn't Moriarity who's left to write the memoirs.
Huh?
Ramsing.
Ramsing?
Who know Ramsing?
I do, you blooming wharf rat.
You've been in jail, ain't ya?
How you know?
I've heard from the blighter what left you to swing instead of him.
You know who
I'm mean matey.
I know.
I'll have to kill him.
Would it be worth ten pounds to you?
You know where he live?
For ten pound I know.
I only got two.
Goodbye matey
Five.
Ten pounds or nothing you lying heathen.
You dirty...
Well it ain't so much to ask, for what you want to know.
You make good bargain.
That does it.
Well?
You remember
Angel's Court.
Huh.
Then follow your nose through the alley till you come to Jed
Brady's Carpenter Shop.
He can tell you where the blighter is at this very moment.
You come too.
Me?
If you lie.
All right, mister.
I'll come along with you.
Easy matey, easy.
Follow me.
Please governor.
I hadn't had nothing to eat for two days.
Ah, go away.
Who's there?
Peg leg.
Who's this bloke?
He's a bloodthirsty heathen but has good money to spend for information.
What's he want to know?
He give me five pounds to bring him to someone what could tell him the whereabouts of you know who.
You no tell me
I cut two throat.
Cost you another fiver.
Five pound more, eh?
You pay him?
Me?
Come on you.
Come on pay him.
I'll tell you all right I will, the truth and that's a fact.
The blight is in
Davey Jones' locker and feeding the fishes he is, deader than a blinking mackerel.
Now ain't that worth a fiver?
I tell you he's alive.
And I say he's been dead these many years.
You're lying.
Easy there Jack Brady.
I would say you were wrong and Mr. Sherlock
Holmes was correct.
Good evening
Professor Moriarity.
Welcome, Holmes.
My men have the instructions to bring anybody here who inquires for me.
They haggled while I watch, an admirable disguise by the way.
It fooled them completely.
Of course it didn't fool me.
I never intended that it should.
I meant only that it should bring us face to face.
Just like old times, eh?
The battle of wits of superior intellects.
I may say I've been expecting you since I made off with your precious Dr. Tobel.
And his code.
Ah yes.
And his code.
But valuable as your doctor and his code are to my business
I think my main interest in this affair is the chance it gives me to battle with you again.
Moriarity, this is no simple crime that you contemplate.
It's a staggering blow against your own country.
That doesn't concern me overly.
I should make greater profits from this affair than all my other adventures put together.
Then you refuse?
Oh, most assuredly.
In fact,
I intend to insure the success of this venture tonight by liquidating you, Mr. Holmes.
I think that is the
American phrase.
Quite.
You are the one man intelligent enough to stand in my way.
Huh, a gun.
Oh, come now.
This is not the
Professor Moriarity, the master criminal
I once knew.
A dock rat could do as much.
Did you think I was going to shoot you, Mr. Holmes?
Oh, oh.
Dear me no.
This is simply to prevent a troublesome scene.
I expected you, and made full arrangements.
You see my good
Mr. Holmes, these shelves lift out and you will rest somewhat uncomfortably in the false bottom of this sea chest.
My sailor friend,
Jack Brady, goes to sea immediately.
Once out of sight of land he pushes the chest overboard.
Tie him up.
Perhaps your good friend, Dr. Watson, can entitle this adventure, the end of
Sherlock Holmes.
He will be disappointed.
He intended to call it the end of
Professor Moriarity.
Hurry.
Aye, sir.
Brilliant man
Sherlock Holmes.
Too bad he was honest.
That one-legged man, he takes Mr. Holmes right to that carpenter shop.
He knocks on the door.
A man comes out and in they go.
Thank you, George.
We'll take over the watch.
Good night, Dr. Watson.
Good night.
What does Mr. Holmes hope to accomplish by this masquerade?
He hopes to frighten Moriarity into rushing Tobel into another hiding place.
Moriarity's dead,
I tell you.
Look out.
Over here, quick.
Hey, just a minute.
Who's there?
What have you got there?
Who's asking?
Scotland Yard.
Scot... governor, I'll show you me papers.
There you are, governor.
I'm Jack Brady, ship's carpenter.
Shipping out tonight in the convoy, destination unknown.
Me pal here is helping me get the chest aboard.
Make him open it, Lestrade.
Yes, or course.
All right governor, see for yourself.
There is nothing here, doctor.
Just a couple of simple seafaring men.
All right get on with it.
Thank you governor.
Come on, now.
Easy does it.
Right there.
Good night, my lordships.
Told you it was a lot of nonsense.
I don't understand.
That thing must weight a ton.
Look at that man staggering.
Do you know something, doctor.
A few tools wouldn't take that much energy.
We've just looked inside.
On the top only.
There might be a false bottom.
Hey you, you stop there.
Stop or I'll shoot.
Great Scott, Holmes.
Well I'll be blowed.
You're not hurt.
No, but you needn't have yelled at them so abruptly.
Huh?
They dropped me on my head.
Oh.
Moriarity would have been delighted.
So Professor
Moriarity is alive.
Alive and in possession of Dr. Tobel's code.
No point going back, they've all gone.
Then what are you going to do?
Well first I'm going to wash this filthy stuff off my face and then I'm going to see Miss Eberli again.
I've got to find some clue to the content of
Dr. Tobel's message.
Come on quick.
I only got one glimpse of the note while he was preparing it.
He was seated at this desk?
No, he was sitting on the couch when he wrote the message but he sealed the envelope here.
The message was written in ink with this pen?
No he used a pencil.
This one.
Thank you.
He used this writing pad?
Yes.
Has it been used since?
No.
It should be here.
It must be here.
What, Mr. Holmes.
The lead in this pencil is hard, hard enough to make an impression on the course fibers of which this paper is made.
Impressions at the moment are invisible.
If we immerse this sheet in the solution of florescent salts, dry it and then photograph it by ultraviolet light the fibers broken by the writing will absorbed less of the solution than other parts of the paper.
Switch off the lights, Watson.
We place the slide in the projector and turn on the light.
The broken fibers appear darken than the rest of the paper and therefore visible.
Splendid, Holmes.
Now I recognize that code.
Do you remember a case we had some years ago?
It's partly the same, alphabet substitution code.
Yes, Watson.
I believe Dr. Tobel meant to communicate with us by that means.
Substitution of the alphabet.
I don't understand.
My dear, one of the oldest codes in use is based on the repetition of figures.
E is a letter most used in the British language therefore the single most used probably in this message is e.
T-a-o-i-n.
Follow in that order of frequency.
You mean you can read these figures as if they were letters of the alphabet.
Elementary, my dear Miss Eberli.
Give me one minute and you shall have the message.
And what is the message, Watson?
This fellow Tobel must have been pulling our legs.
There's a lot of gibberish.
L-y-z-l-m-t-h-k.
Reads like an eye doctor's chart.
Dr. Tobel is a brilliant scientist.
I saw immediately that he wouldn't send us a message so simple to decipher.
Neither would he have fixed these top figures without a meaning.
Then it isn't the alphabet substitution code.
Yes it is, Watson, but with a very clever variation.
You see the one, two, three figures means that we skip letters in that order.
In other words, observe Watson.
The first letter, which is I skips one, becomes J.
The second letter, Y, skips two and becomes A and the third skips three and becomes C.
J-a-c...
J-a-c-o-b, D-u-r-r-e-i.
Jacob Durrei, a
Swiss scientist and friend of
Dr. Tobel's.
P-a-l-a-c-e, C-r-e-s...
Palace Crescent.
Right.
I say Holmes, this man, Durrei, must be important.
Obviously, Watson.
He must have some connection with the bomb sight or Tobel wouldn't have taken so much trouble to see that
I got his name.
Take down the rest of the message.
J-o-s-e-p-h, Joseph.
E-m-d-d-i-a-c, number four doesn't make any sense.
He must have used some other variations.
Four names and addresses,
Jacob Durrei,
Professor Fallow,
Dr. Kern and this forth infernal cipher which doesn't get the code.
Christmas boxes.
Watson, I'm beginning to see the plan.
Dr. Tobel divided his bomb sight into four parts just as we brought it back from Switzerland.
He's given one section of the mechanism to each of these famous scientists.
What a fascinating plan.
You see each part is useless without the other three and undoubtedly none of these scientists is known to each other.
Professor Moriarity also has the code and we must allow for his ability to decipher it.
We haven't time to break the fourth code now.
We must get to the first three men before Moriarity does.
Palace Crescent first?
Right.
I'll go and get a taxi.
Miss Eberli, will you please wait here till we return?
Thank you.
Yeah, where are you going, sir?
Jacob Durrei live here?
Yes, but there's been a bit of trouble so you can't go in.
Inspector
Lestrade's orders.
Oh, Hey, just a minute, sir.
That's Mr.
Sherlock Holmes.
Oh, very sorry, sir.
Dead?
Dead as a door nail.
Mr. Holmes, how did you know about this?
The Yard only got here fifteen minutes ago.
We'd better hurry Holmes.
There's still time to save Fallow and Kern.
Too late, Watson.
By this time Fallow and Kern are dead too.
What?
Deductions again,
Mr. Holmes?
Facts Inspector.
Oh, facts.
But how did you know about them?
Elementary, my dear Watson.
This man has been dead for at least two hours and Moriarity isn't wasting any time.
Hello?
This is Lestrade.
Put me on to Mackety.
Hello, Mackety, hello, this is Lestrade.
Do you know anything about two men named
Fallow and Kern?
Fallow and Kern?
Both of them?
Oh.
Thank you.
The report only came in two seconds before
I telephoned.
What on earth are we going to do, Holmes?
Moriarity's got a big start and he's got the code?
Note this Watson.
Scotland Yard reports two murderers.
That makes three in all.
But there were four boxes and four codes.
Obviously Moriarity hasn't broken the fourth code either.
What is the name of the fourth man?
I can't remember.
What is the name of the fourth man?
I have forgotten.
What is the name of the fourth man?
I don't know.
I don't know.
What is the name of the fourth man?
I can't remember.
What is the name of the fourth man?
What is the name of the fourth man?
But Holmes, don't you realize what this means to England?
We not only lose the
Tobel bomb sight ourselves but Germany gets it.
Coventry, Bath,
Plymouth, London.
And not to mention Norigno.
All over again but with ten times the effect.
Don't you suppose
I realize that,
Sir Reginald?
Don't you suppose
I give my life to decode the last name of that message?
Well there must be some solution.
Naturally, Watson.
I don't mean to be rude, I need a drink.
I'm all in.
I can't think anymore.
All these letters and figures running through my brain all twisted around.
Twisted around.
What?
That's it.
That's what?
Twisted around you said.
It's so simple I never thought of it.
Reverse the slide.
You see, gentlemen.
These figures are now identical with the first three names.
In other words, all the figures of name number four are written backwards and read from right to left until we reverse the slide when they read correctly from left to right.
Now let's work on it.
Pencil Watson.
But, um, why would Dr. Tobel want to reverse the figures of number four.
An added precaution, Lestrade in case the cipher should fall into the wrong hands.
Quite a compliment to you, Mr. Holmes.
I mean, Tobel taken for granted that you would recognize the difference.
Thank you.
Ohh.
F-r-e-d-e-r-i-c-k,
H-o-f-f-n-e-r,
Frederick Hoffner.
S-l-o-a-n-e S-q-u...
Sloane Square.
We must leave at once.
Wait a minute.
Information?
Will you please give me the address of a Frederick Hoffner in Sloane Square.
I'll break this code.
I'll find the name of that fourth man before Holmes does.
There is not much more time.
The submarine is to pick us up off Shanese in six hours.
I've beaten Holmes so far.
We don't need the confounded submarine with the bomber sight in tact.
But Tobel is unconscious again.
As last resort we could abandon the code and take Tobel to Germany.
We'll try Tobel again in here.
Wait.
Spilling that glass of water was a very fortunate accident, my dear street brawler.
Dr. Tobel's perversion of the cipher was so simple that it fooled us.
I was looking for something ingenious.
This is ingenious.
He simply reversed the cipher.
F-r-e-d-e-r-i-c-k,
H-o-f-f-n-e-r,
S-l-o-a-n-e.
Frederick Hoffner,
Sloane Square.
Of course.
Hoffner would be the perfect selection.
Then you want us to tend to Hoffner?
No, we can use Hoffner.
He's a brilliant scientist.
If Dr. Tobel doesn't recover from your persuasion,
Hoffner would be able to put the four parts together.
You and Godfrey will call on Hoffner and you will bring him here with the fourth section of the bomb sight.
Hurry.
Put up your hands,
Professor Hoffner.
I'll take the box.
We Meet again, Professor.
Sherlock Holmes.
An improvement on the other make-up.
Don't you think so, Professor.
So you think you've beaten me, Holmes?
I have.
The real Hoffner is safely in the hands of
Scotland Yard.
But I still have Tobel and now I shall sell
Germany the inventor instead of the invention.
You've learned nothing from him in spite of all your torture otherwise you wouldn't be trying so desperately to collect the four sections of the bomb sight.
A keen observation, my dear Holmes, but observe further that you are now in my hands and I have profited by my last mistake by allowing underlings to attend to you.
Holmes took my place and while the Nazis were inside with him he instructed me to attach a small apparatus underneath their car.
He's a brilliant fellow, Holmes.
I helped him prepare the apparatus.
Did you really, doctor?
That is I poured the luminous paint when he told me to.
Very clever, Dr. Watson.
The apparatus drips at regular intervals leaving a trail of luminous paint.
I see.
Leading us to Moriarity and Mr. Holmes.
Why are you so confident, Professor?
Only a suggestion.
But how do you know that Scotland Yard isn't waiting to break in at this very moment?
I selected this address with special care.
No one can find it, not even Scotland Yard.
Relax, Mr. Holmes.
There's no escape.
And I'd suddenly dash to the window and break it open and shout to a passerby.
There are no passersby.
The glass in the window is unbreakable and the room is soundproof.
This is my stronghold, Holmes, equipped with all the modern conveniences of a successful man in my profession.
Sit down.
They cleared up again, sir.
I don't understand,
Lestrade.
It stopped and then it started and now it stopped again.
Maybe the apparatus broke down.
Oh, a suggestion, gentlemen.
At a crossroad back there a car might have gone over the spots of paint, picked some up on the tires and left this false trail.
Just what
I was about to...
Just what I was about to suggest myself.
Very well.
We'll try it.
Now Holmes, what will it be?
The gas chamber, a cup of hemlock or just a simple bullet through your brain?
You disappoint me, professor.
Indeed.
Yes.
Somehow I always thought that in the end you'd prove to be just an ordinary cutthroat.
You know me better, Holmes.
Gas, poison, bullets.
I assure you, professor, were our position's reversed
I should have something more colorful, more imaginative to offer.
I'm satisfied to be the winner.
I shall be alive.
Alive, yes, the winner, no, for in the last analysis
I shall have proved the more resourceful man.
You didn't trap me here.
I came here because
I wanted to, to prevent your getting Hoffner and all you can do in return is to commit ordinary murder to relieve your sense of frustration.
And what, my good Mr. Holmes, could you have conceived that would have been so much more colorful?
Well even offhand
I can improve upon your suggestions considerably, but that's only natural of course.
And what is this brilliant idea of yours?
You know that a man dies if he loses five pints of blood?
Yes, of course you do.
I should have you placed on an operating table, inject a needle into your veins and slowly draw off your life's blood.
The needle to the last, ay, Holmes?
Slowly, drop-by-drop the blood would be drawn from your body.
You would be aware of every exquisite second to the very end.
You would be watching yourself die scientifically noting every reaction and in full possession of your faculties.
Interesting.
Yes, isn't it.
I humbly submit, professor, that to the very end
I've been more resourceful than yourself.
You've played into my hands,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Time and again I've used this place as a haven for friends of mine injured in alterations with Scotland Yard.
I have a fully equipped hospital here.
The trail goes this way, inspector.
Drop by drop, Holmes.
Drop by drop.
Ahh, in a way
I'm almost sorry.
You were a stimulating influence to me but it was obvious that
I should win in the end.
Only a matter of moments now.
Take Tobel down to the boat.
Start the engine.
Closer to the end Holmes, closer and closer.
Each second a few more drops leave your desiccated body ending, you can feel me touch you.
You're perfectly conscious aren't you, Holmes?
I shall be conscious long after you're dead, Moriarity.
Ahh.
Still the same old swaggering conceded
Sherlock Holmes.
Wait.
If Moriarity hears a shot he'll kill Holmes.
You keep an eye on the boat.
Don't make a move till Dr. Watson and I get inside.
Understand?
You wait here,
Professor Hoffner.
Come on doctor.
The water's this way.
Moriarity's rooms must be up here.
I can't wait any longer, Holmes.
You'll have to forgive the crudity my friend.
This is only the coups de gras.
[Shot]
Stay still, Moriarity.
You're done for.
Holmes!
On the contrary, inspector, my men are outside.
It's you who are done for.
Really?
Just take a look out the window and see for yourself.
He's trying to get to the speedboat.
Yes, he won't go without Tobel.
Wait.
Here's Dr.
Tobel, inspector.
He ain't too badly hurt.
Thank heavens for that.
Look after him will you Hoffner?
I'll take him to the car.
Well I expected you but not with my revolver.
You realize, of course, when I was brought into the room blindfolded
I heard the mechanism of this door.
Of course.
And yet knowing that I'd heard it you planned this way of escape.
Not very flattering to me.
Suicide my dear professor.
Not at all, my dear Holmes.
You see this is not an ordinary passageway.
Oh, my mistake.
It has been equally well prepared as the rest of my humble quarters.
I have a trap set, electric eye principle.
My passing through will break the beam and automatically open the highly deceptive trap door behind me, of course.
My pursuer, meaning you my dear Holmes, will then be plunged sixty feet into the sewers below.
Holmes.
Holmes.
Poor Moriarity.
I neglected to warn him.
It seems some careless person came across his trap door and left it open.
Come along, Watson.
Germany wanted the
Tobel bomb sight, but will send her thousands of them in our airplanes.
Yes, thanks to
Mr. Sherlock Holmes and to Mrs. Tobel.
And, of course,
Inspector Lestrade.
Oh well, that's all right, Miss.
Things are looking up, Holmes.
This little islands still on the map.
Yes.
This fortress built by nature for herself, this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.

You're such a child, Caroline.
I sometimes wonder if it's fair to marry you till you're old enough to know your own mind.
Oh, I'm 19.
You seen so little of the world and other men.
What if you find later on you made a mistake?
I shan't.
You should hear what your tenants say of you, Ralph.
Look how good you are to your poor relations.
I can't imagine any other man putting up with.
Cousin Agatha and the twins bickering all day long.
You're the one who has to bear the brunt of that.
Nothing I do could repay all you did for me... when I first came after Father died.
You were a forlorn little thing.
I was lonely and frightened.
You understood so well.
I only wish all my investments paid such a handsome dividend.
- Look at the way you run my house.
- I believe that's why you're marrying me.
- You're not in love with me, you know.
- Oh?
I'm, I'm not the demonstrative sort... but I'm very, very fond of you.
That's because you're used to me.
Because we agree about most things.
But that's not love.
Then I'm afraid I'll never be in love.
I don't know what I do without you.
- Moll, please let me pass.
- All in good time, Cousin Agatha.
All in good time.
Don't behave like children, you silly old women.
- Old?
- You heard what I said.
- We're not as old...
- As you are.
- And if we a name like Trimble...
- we change it.
Aunt Doll and Moll,
I told you not to tease Cousin Agatha.
- Well,
- It's like this, Caroline.
- There is a letter for you in the library.
- Oh, we wanted to tell her.
She's coming. Barbara is coming to be my maid of honor.
- Is she...
- Pretty?
Pretty is too tame a word for her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I ever seen.
- Green, like emeralds.
- Cats have green eyes.
I don't like cats.
Barbara is always been my dearest friend.
We're more like sisters than cousins.
Uncle Martin is a little dull, like most merchants in the city... and Aunt Beatrice is very straitlaced... but Barbara is always one for excitement.
When we were children, she made everything seem like an adventure.
She may have changed, you know.
People do in five years.
Oh, you wait till you see her.
She'll take your breath away.
- Caro.
- Barbara, darling.
I can't believe it. Let me look at you.
Oh, it's been ages since we met.
You haven't changed. Not really.
And your eyes are still green.
Oh. Oh, Ralph, this is Barbara.
- Barbara, Ralph.
- Charmed.
Charmed.
Doesn't she take your breath away?
- Well I...
- Oh Caro, don't. You embarrass him.
My happiness is complete.
The two people I love most in the world.
Come, Barbara. You must be exhausted after your journey.
We'll see you at dinner.
When you're married, you can have everything you want.
You can fill this house with amusing people.
You can go to London and become a famous hostess.
I don't think Ralph would care for that.
Oh, a clever woman can make her husband do as she likes.
But if a woman truly loves her husband, she rather do as he likes.
Still the same self-sacrificing little ninny.
You ought to have been sent to live with Aunt Beatrice and Uncle Martin.
I ought to have come here.
Fasten my bodice, will you?
Poor Barbara.
Has it been so very dull for you?
Dull, respectable, commonplace.
I loathe it. All Aunt Beatty thinks about... is what is going to happen to us when we're dead.
If I can't live while I'm alive, I'll go mad.
Oh, this is a lovely gown.
So are all the others.
I had them specially made to come here.
Of course, Aunt Beatty disapproved, but I got round Uncle Martin.
He even let me have dancing lessons... and he took me to the theater to see the play.
The king was there with the Duchess of Portsmouth.
Everybody stared at her.
That's what I want - to be envied and admired.
We'll have to find you a nice husband.
But I'm afraid all the landowners round here are married... except for Ralph.
No, not like that. Gracefully.
Then I curtsy.
You raise me up...
- and then we kiss.
- We what?
All fashionable dances nowadays end with a kiss.
I fear I'll make no dancer.
Good morning. I expected to have the park to myself at this early hour.
I always visit the Home Farm before breakfast.
I didn't know.
Barbara, I wish you hadn't chosen Fleury.
He's wild and dangerous.
I like danger.
I believe you do.
You're very serious.
Would you rather ride alone?
Oh, no, indeed not.
Forgive me. I was thinking.
Then I must be looking very plain.
You look lovely.
Help.
Ralph, help. He's bolted.
Ralph, help me, help me.
Keep clear of the trees.
Keep clear of the trees.
Come on, Fleury. Come on.
Now.
Barbara. Barbara.
Ralph.
- It's very beautiful.
- Beautiful.
Beautiful.
What are you sniveling about?
It makes us think how different things might have been -
For us.
You shouldn't put your veil on -
Before the fatal day.
I'm not superstitious.
Ralph is a lucky man.
I'm the lucky one.
You love him very much, don't you, my dear?
Yes.
Very much.
Caroline, I must speak to you, alone.
Why, of course. You don't mind, do you?
I certainly do, but if we're not wanted -
- Can't we stay-
- And hear what it's about?
We might as well be serving wenches or dressmakers. Come along, girls.
- Oh, and it's sure to be...
- Something exciting.
What is it, Barbara?
What is it, darling? What is the matter?
- I must go. I can't stay here.
- Why? What is happened?
Don't ask me.
I got to go before it's too late.
I mustn't ever see him again.
Him?
Is it something to do with Ralph?
We couldn't help ourselves.
It was stronger than either of us.
- Tell me what is happened.
- Ralph and I love each other.
We love each other.
- He told you?
- Yes.
Yes, but he didn't have to tell me. I knew.
What am I going to do?
Oh, you don't have to worry. He'll marry you.
We agreed I must go away.
Ralph, are you in love with Barbara?
Caroline my dear, I, I...
Well, I suppose I must be.
I'm attracted by her. Dazzled by her.
You love her, Ralph.
I, I think I known it ever since she came here.
But if you felt that, then I tried to persuade myself it wasn't true, but... well, now I can't pretend anymore.
Oh, God. I tried to fight against it.
There are some things, they just happen.
No one can fight against them.
You never pretended you were in love with me.
- Caroline, please.
- Nor I with you.
We were just fond of each other.
Just give me time to get over it.
Everything will be all right. After the wedding, we'll go away for a while and...
Oh. Forgive me.
I should like to leave at once.
If the coach could be ordered...
It isn't necessary. Ralph is free to marry the one he loves.
Caroline.
Caro, darling, as if I could accept such a sacrifice.
Why, I rather break my own heart than...
No hearts are going to be broken.
Ralph and I have never been in love.
But the wedding, everything is arranged.
It can still take place, but with a different bride.
- Caroline, it's unthinkable.
- Why?
- Apart from your feelings, the, the scandal.
- There will be a scandal anyway.
You may as well get it all over at once.
As for my feelings... my vanity may be hurt, but what is that compared... to what might happened if you...
If we found out too late?
I...
I hope you'll make each other very, very happy.
- Caroline, where are you going?
- To pack.
I'm the one who needs the coach now.
I'll go after her.
- Caro.
- Yes?
- You mustn't go away.
- But I can't stay here now.
But think what Ralph enemies will make of it.
They will say he broke your heart.
If you any feeling for him, even if it's only gratitude, you won't leave him now.
He'll never live it down.
All right. I'll stay.
Not only that, I'll be your maid of honor.
- That ought to stop all gossip.
- Oh, thank you, Caro.
Oh, look how I'm dressed.
Isn't it ridiculous?
You can wear this too if you like.
Wear that?
I wouldn't be buried in it.
Well, Barbara, this is a proud day for me.
- Thank you, Uncle Martin.
- Sir Ralph is a fine man.
You must love him very much.
How could one fail to love a man as rich as he is?
That's no way to jest on your wedding day.
Our sense of humor always differed.
Barbara, I know how deeply you loved your mother... how cruel a blow it was when she was taken from you.
She was everything to me.
The only person I ever really cared for.
You may be sure she's watching you with happiness today.
This is her broach.
Oh. Let me see it.
It was her dying wish that I should give it to you on your wedding day.
It's beautiful. I'll never part with it.
It means more to me than the Skelton diamonds...
Maryiot Cells, anything.
She's lovely.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together... here in the sight of God... and in the face of this congregation to join together this man and this woman... in holy matrimony... an honorable estate instituted of God... in the time of man innocence... signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ...
Oh, dear.
I trust the dance was to your satisfaction.
Oh, come, my dear.
Mustn't be jealous of our new sister in law.
It's the privilege of every man to claim a dance and a kiss from the bride.
I need a hundred pairs of feet and as many mouths to fulfill my obligations.
Perhaps you could ask Caroline to help you.
- After all, you two have shared so much.
- Henrietta...
Ralph, you mustn't be angry with your sister.
No woman can bear it if her husband finds another more attractive.
- Can she, Henrietta?
- Lady Skelton, would you do me the honor?
- Oh, forgive me but...
- But?
But of course.
Who are you?
The man who would married you, had we met yesterday.
You're very bold sir.
You are the most exciting woman I ever met.
I fell in love with you in the church... as you were being led to the altar with another man.
Jesting is in bad taste.
It's no jest that for the rest of my life
I shall find no other woman... who can stir my pulse or tear at my heartstrings as you.
I believe you mean what you say.
Look at Barbara.
It's high time she was prepared for the marriage bed.
But...
You and the bridesmaids must take her upstairs.
Must I? Couldn't they manage without me?
No, child. You're the maid of honor.
Don't let them guess now.
Kiss the bride. Kiss the bride.
- Barbara, it's time to go...
- To the bridal chamber.
Come along, Barbara.
You mustn't keep your husband waiting.
- It's your bedtime.
- I don't want to go to bed.
I want to go on dancing and enjoy myself.
You don't have to dance to enjoy yourself.
Oh. The bridal chamber.
Oh, Barbara, don't you feel terrified?
Just look at that bed.
- The very blankets edged with satin.
- They don't look very warm.
I warrant Barbara won't feel the cold tonight.
Are you ready for the fray, you lucky hound?
Don't be bashful. Knock.
- Oh.
- Go on. Say it, Caroline.
Your bride awaits you.
Oh, a very handsome man was Lord Rashley.
Buried in the West Indies. Married to...
Married to a cousin on my father side.
A lovely creature. Now, when
I say cousin, I don't exactly mean...
It's the east wind.
Always brings on the Skelton cough.
Well, as I was saying, she wasn't exactly my cousin.
My father and her stepmother were cousins once removed.
I been working it out.
She's no relation at all.
What do you mean? Of course she's my cousin.
She was your father stepmother cousin.
Once removed.
If she was a dozen times removed, she's still my cousin.
Barbara, I appeal to you.
- Leave us.
- Yes, milady.
Those stupid old hens.
They're driving me insane.
There is no end to their dreary bickering.
You too much time on your hands.
If you took over the housekeeping...
Caro, darling, don't start that again.
Oh, but I must.
You asked me to stay until you got used to it.
- That was more than six months ago.
- I couldn't do it.
You haven't even tried.
I can't swim, but I know it without jumping in the river.
Well, Hogarth? What do you want?
I came to fetch a coat for the footman Thomas, my lady.
Behold, I have caused thine iniquity... to pass from thee... and I will clothe thee... with a change of raiment.
Zechariah, chapter 3, verse 4.
Spare the quotation for your servants' bible class, Hogarth.
Very well, my lady.
- Oh, Hogarth?
- My lady?
I want the key to the room at the end of the south wing.
But my lady, that room hasn't been used... since we discovered the secret passage leading to the park.
It was last occupied by Sir Ralph uncle, old...
I didn't ask for a history of Maryiot Cells, Hogarth... but for a key.
Very good, my lady.
Thank you. Come, Caroline.
- Barbara, what on earth...
- Now, don't you try and thwart me too.
Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher.
All is vanity.
Ecclesiastes, chapter 1, verse 2.
Or is it 3?
I don't like this room. It's cold, clammy.
It will be all right when it's been cleaned and aired.
Have it done for me, Caro, so that I can move in soon.
- I'm sure Ralph won't want to.
- Well, that's the idea.
Don't look so shocked.
It's quite fashionable nowadays for husbands and wives to have separate rooms.
- Ralph isn't a fashionable person.
- More is the pity.
He might take me to London and give me a good time.
But he did take you, on your honeymoon.
For a whole week, to stay with Kingsclere... and that patronizing fool of a wife of his, Henrietta.
I want to live in the fashionable world.
I want to be admired and talked about.
I got brains and looks and personality.
I want to use them instead of rotting in this dull hole.
Dull? With Ralph?
Oh, come, my sweet.
Even you must admit he isn't exactly exciting.
But if you're in love with someone...
Barbara, you are still in love with Ralph, aren't you?
Yes, of course, silly.
But one can't spend all one time billing and cooing.
Let's change the subject.
What about the secret passage? Where is it?
- There.
- Oh, why wasn't I told about this before?
- Come on. Let's explore.
- I haven't got time.
You better have it boarded up.
You might get unwelcome visitors.
Wouldn't it be useful if I had a lover?
Now I have shocked you. I was only teasing.
I never know when you're joking.
I got to get the Kingscleres room ready.
Oh, always the Kingscleres.
- He's a bore, and I hate Henrietta.
- Barbara. Why?
I'll never forgive her for the things she said at my wedding.
Henrietta. How lovely to see you again.
Thank you, my dear.
But Ralph, you taken away her sparkle.
It's hard to believe that six months could have changed you so much.
I used to quite envy you.
You used to look so young and lovely.
Is it only six months? Then it must be the journey that's tired you out.
- Traveling makes one look so bedraggled.
- Henrietta...
- what is the latest from London?
- It's been a brilliant season.
Really exciting. Never an evening at home.
Oh, poor Henrietta.
No wonder you look so worn.
Don't worry about me, darling.
I think I rather look worn than dull.
There is a new card game... called ombre sweeping the town.
- The king is taken it up.
- As a change from find the lady... but I don't suppose you ever heard of it down here.
Oh, on the contrary. I play it regularly.
- But...
- In that case, we must test your skill.
It may cost you more than you care to lose.
For a regular player, you play a very irregular game.
Fortune hasn't smiled on me yet.
No, I should say her expression is definitely a leer.
Why don't you stop, Barbara?
Your luck may change tomorrow.
Tomorrow you leave.
At least give me the chance to recover.
Certainly, darling.
After all, it's only midnight.
In London, that's when we begin to wake up.
Well, I'm no Londoner. I'm for bed.
There is no need to wait for me tonight.
I hadn't forgotten. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
My dear, why do you two sleep apart?
Perhaps because in one own room... it's easier to mind one own business.
Your play, I think.
Oh. Ralph, I...
I forgot these things of Barbara.
Oh, yes, of course.
I, I hear it's quite the fashionable thing... for husbands and wives to have separate rooms.
Indeed.
Ralph, wouldn't it be a good idea... if you took a house in London and did some entertaining?
Good? For whom?
Well, it is rather dull to bury yourself in the country all the year... and Barbara would make a wonderful hostess.
No, Caroline. What do you suppose would happen here if I were away?
Neglect and injustice. All the things
I been striving for, swept aside.
Good night, Caroline.
Good night.
Had enough, my dear? Or would you like to stake your wedding ring too?
- Oh. Oh.
- Don't look so guilty, Kingsclere.
Barbara knew we were seasoned gamesters.
Yes, my dear, but I can't help thinking old Ralph won't like it.
He'll thank us if it teaches Barbara to be content with housekeeping... and other wifely pursuits.
I'll play you for this against everything you won.
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?
Mustn't do it, Hetty. Not fair.
How many games shall we play?
I'll stake it on a single turn of the cards.
Cut.
Queen.
King.
Quite pretty, isn't it?
I shall wear it next time I go to court.
Your mother, wasn't it?
Thank heavens I can lie abed tomorrow after you leave for town.
Glad to see the back of me, eh?
Women are all the same once you're married to them.
You must console yourself in her absence.
I hope, dear Henrietta, you'll stay over the week and give him a fair field.
How sweet of you, my dear.
But I'm afraid I have a supper party on Friday night... so I must tear myself away by sunset.
Still, I shall console myself by wearing your ruby.
It will go perfectly with my new gown.
Look out some highwayman fellow doesn't steal it from you.
They say the notorious Captain Jackson rides in these parts.
Captain Jackson? Who knows?
It might be worth the loss of a trinket to meet... so bold and handsome a robber... especially a trinket so easily won.
Good night.
This is her broach.
It was her dying wish that I should give it to you on your wedding day.
I'll never part with it.
It means more to me... than the Skelton diamonds,
Maryiot Cells, anything.
Still, I shall console myself by wearing your ruby.
Look out some highwayman fellow doesn't steal it from you.
Why not?
She's coming, Fleury. She's coming.
Now, Henrietta.
Halt.
One move and I shoot to kill.
Oh, good sir, have pity on a defenseless woman.
- The jewels. Quickly.
- Oh, but Mr. Jackson...
Captain Jackson, I haven't a Jewel with me.
Oh. Oh, I heard how gallant you are with ladies.
If a kiss would satisfy you, a kiss or, or anything, I...
- Oh, but Mr. Jackson, please.
- Thanks for the jewels. And the offer.
After him. After him. Shoot the scoundrel.
Oh, my jewels. My jewels. My...
Open up. Open up. Highwayman.
My broach, my rings all of them gone.
It was a ghastly experience.
I shall never recover from it. Never.
Oh, I feel quite faint.
- Drink this brandy.
- No, it would choke me.
I thought you manage.
Henrietta, calm yourself and tell us what happened.
What is all this commotion?
Henrietta. Why have you come back?
- She's been robbed...
- By a highwayman.
- Captain Jackson himself.
- He didn't take my ruby broach?
He did. My rings, almost everything.
Henrietta, you fool.
Why did you wear it? You were warned.
It's no use upsetting yourself, Barbara.
Are you sure it was this Captain Jackson?
Oh, quite. I recognized him at once.
- Is he very dashing?
- Romantic looking and handsome?
Extremely handsome.
How do you know? Surely he wore a mask.
Only a very little one.
- Did he make any...
- Ungentlemanly advances?
They want to know if he kissed you.
- Worse.
- Worse?
- What happened?
- I slapped his face.
Slapped his face?
I said, You may take my jewels, but my honor no man shall touch.
- What did he do?
- Took my jewels.
And left your honor. How fortunate.
Yes, wasn't it? When I was telling him... how disgraceful his behavior was, he kissed me.
- Kissed you?
- From his horse?
Well, you see...
The horse, like the mask, was probably a very little one.
Barbara, are you trying to make a fool of me?
Of course not, Henrietta. There is no need.
This man must be found and brought to justice.
That may not be so easy.
I should think he's very clever.
I don't think it's clever to hide in the darkness and spring on any defenseless traveler.
Who may, of course, be armed.
The highwayman always has the advantage of surprise... and the pistol in his hand gives him mastery.
Nevertheless, he must've great courage and determination.
And think of the exhilaration... the excitement and the danger.
Once a man is taken to the road, everything else must seem tame and insipid.
I don't see how he could ever give it up.
Halt.
Hold your hands above your heads.
One move and I shoot.
Out into the road, all of you, and bring your valuables with you.
Get down, both of you.
What is the matter? Got highwayman cramp?
Come on. Hurry up.
Get into line.
You'll hang for this, you scoundrel.
This watch will make sure
I'm not late for the execution.
Oh, please don't take my rings.
They been in my family for the past century.
They will be in mine for the next.
I assure you sir,
I'm as poor as a church mouse.
- Finished?
- Yes.
Hey. My coach.
After me.
Now perhaps you'll tell me who gave you leave... to trespass on Jerry Jackson preserves.
By my stars.
So it's a skirt we have in the saddle.
You very nearly had a corpse.
Do you always take women by the throat?
- No, I just take them.
- The gallant Captain Jackson.
So you heard of me, eh?
Well, that stretch of road between
Fenny Stratford and Nether Weald... is sacred to the said Captain Jackson.
Those who poach there do so at their peril.
- I shan't forget your warning.
- Good.
Though I may ignore it.
I like your spirit, my pretty lamb.
You may poach from Land End to John o' Groats if you like.
Thank you.
I thought myself in luck tonight,
I can tell you.
Nothing to do but sit back and watch while you collected the goldfinches for me.
- For us.
- Well, that depends.
This isn't a matter that can be settled quickly or with dry throats.
I know an inn near here where the hostess is the best cook in Buckinghamshire.
Will you do me the favor of supping with me?
What have I got to lose?
That is a matter for conjecture.
Betsy?
Why, Captain Jackson, you're welcome.
And you too sir.
Can you give us a bite of supper in the parlor?
I told my friend there are two things you do better than most women.
One of them is cooking.
Shame on you, Captain.
In front of a stranger.
After you sir.
- All right, George. I helped myself.
- Very good sir.
They seem to be enjoying themselves.
Who are they?
That's Jim Mellor and some of his cronies.
They had a big picking on the Portsmouth road two nights ago.
They been celebrating ever since.
This, then, is a haunt of the brotherhood.
- Only the best of them, my dear.
- I'm honored.
Mistress Betsy says sir, there will be stewed carp... pigeon pie, a dish of meats, tongues, and cheese.
Tell her not to serve till she's called.
My friend and I don't want to be disturbed... while we talk.
Very good sir.
May I?
You're still wearing your mask, Captain Jackson.
At your service, madam.
- You remind me of a man I knew.
- A lover?
We met but once... and the moment was not propitious.
Now for your share of the bargain.
It's a damned shame to cover up so much beauty.
There is more lasting beauty in my pockets.
Wouldn't you rather see that?
I'm more interested in you at the moment. Who are you?
Does it matter what I'm called?
Fleur, Dorothy, Barbara, take your choice.
Barbara. That suits you best.
Married, eh?
Your husband ought to know his business better than to drive you... to find your pleasure on the highway.
Or is it money you're after?
No.
Although I confess there wouldn't be much pleasure without it.
You're right.
If I'm to dance from a rope at Tyburn in the end...
I must've my pockets full of guineas meanwhile.
I can teach you better ways of avoiding boredom than trotting the highways.
Not so fast, Captain Jackson.
I not deceived my husband yet.
Then it's time you began.
The careless fool deserves all he gets.
One moment. What of the jewels and the money?
Keep them. I can be generous if you can.
I like to drive a hard bargain.
So do I.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. Surely our object... is to debate ways of trapping the highwayman.
Debating is no good to a highwayman.
I say hang the lot.
First catch your highwayman.
It seems his first appearance dates back... to the night my sister coach was held up on the Fenny Stratford Road.
That was five months ago, and he's still at large.
It's outrageous.
- I'm still convinced it's Jackson work.
- No.
Within an hour of my sister being robbed...
Jackson was holding up the York coach, over 200 miles away.
The ladies say the gallant captain always travels fast.
This is no laughing matter.
- You're to blame for the whole thing.
- I am?
Aye. By your leniency on the bench, you encourage lawbreakers.
And cosset and spoil your tenants too.
Make them lazy and eager for more privileges.
I'm sick of having your name hurled at me every time one of them... wants his house thatched or some of this newfangled glass put in his windows.
Can't you get it into your heads... that these people are human beings like you and me?
I wish I had some of you before me on the bench.
I make you sting for your treatment of your tenants.
As for my so called leniency... it's my duty to administer justice... and I don't think it just to send some poor devil to the gallows... for a trifling theft committed through sheer want.
You rather betray your own class.
And encourage scoundrels like this highwayman.
Just a moment. When it comes to violence against defenseless people... no one has found me lenient yet, nor will they.
Help me to lay this highwayman by the heels, and I promise you... whoever he is, he'll hang.
Come in.
- Good morning, Barbara.
- Oh, it's you.
I gave orders I wasn't to be disturbed.
You had to get up sometime.
It's past 12 o'clock.
I want to speak to you about Ralph.
Not first thing in the morning, please.
There is a meeting downstairs about the highwaymen.
What about them?
- They're blaming Ralph.
- Ralph? Why?
For being too lenient on the bench.
Oh. Well, what am I supposed to do about it?
Barbara, he needs your help and understanding.
If you took a little interest in his work... what is happened between you and Ralph?
Happened? Nothing.
That's just the trouble.
I'm sick to death of entertaining his dreary guests... of listening to their endless discussions on the quarter sessions... poachers, tenants, crops.
I'm sick of hearing the same family prayers morning after morning... of sitting in the Skelton pew every Sunday of the year.
Most of all, I'm sick of Ralph.
You, you mean you don't love him anymore?
- I never have.
- You never have?
But you took him from me.
I never could resist anything that belonged to somebody else.
I thought it would be amusing to be Lady Skelton... to have money, jewels... lead a gay, exciting life.
But all Ralph thinks about is his duty.
I hate him for it.
And you pretended to love him.
You knew how I loved him, yet you took him from me.
You let me humiliate myself at your wedding.
You persuaded me to stay here when... when every instinct urged me to go away.
I'm getting a little tired of having you remind me of mistakes I sooner forget.
I once begged you to stay.
Now I'm telling you to go.
And leave Ralph to your tender mercies? No.
If you think I'm going to have you here making love to my...
You fool.
To do that to me.
- Who is it?
- Ralph.
One moment.
Come in.
- Well, they gone.
- Were they difficult?
- Not more than usual.
- What about the highwaymen?
We arranged road patrols.
We hope to catch them unawares.
Indeed? You must tell me all about it later.
Is that what you mean by taking an interest in my husband affairs?
I must go.
Well, Ralph, to what do I owe this early call?
Barbara, I'm worried about you.
This lying in bed half the day...
Why should you worry, since I'm always unaccompanied?
I noticed a strange restlessness in you lately. You not been yourself.
What is myself?
I don't really know.
Barbara, I'm afraid I been selfish.
I think it would do us both good... to go to London for a change.
No, thank you, Ralph. I don't want to go.
But you complained so often about being buried in the country.
Well, I changed my mind.
There is an interest, an excitement in the country... of which I never dreamed.
Oh, you devil, to take my rings.
- Now the earrings.
- No. No.
I'll never forget your generosity.
- That's all I'll take from you.
- I'll do more.
I'll make her a gift.
Somebody is coming.
Quick, back to your horse.
Why did you shoot that horse?
I rather kill a man any day.
You won't when you been as near to wearing a Tyburn tippet as I have.
Highway robbery is a hanging matter anyhow.
You a fairer chance of buying an acquittal if you're not a killer.
As for horses, no one is fonder of a prancer than I am... but your first aim is to avoid pursuit.
Yes, you're right.
There is still much you can teach me of the road.
It's not of the road that I want to teach you tonight.
Let's go to the inn.

♪ For him ♪
I don't see why I had to be dragged here to be godmother.
There have been Cotterills on our land for 140 years.
I don't ask much from you, but I demand courtesy to my tenants and friends.
It, it seems only yesterday, but in fact it's almost a year... since we were here celebrating our young friend wedding.
Ah, that's right.
They didn't waste no time, did ye, lad?
I, I know it was a disappointment to my friend Tom Cotterill here... when young Ned decided to forsake farming for a more exciting life... but now there is another Cotterill to carry on the old tradition.
Ah, with more to follow. Never fear.
And so, and so I ask you to drink... to the health and happiness of this newest member... of a grand old English family.
To the future Farmer Cotterill.
- You have no drink, milady.
- Thank you.
And what is this new and exciting life of yours, Ned?
I'm with a coaching company, milady. A guard.
Are you indeed?
That must be very interesting.
Aye, and responsible too.
I hope you guard your passengers well.
We don't bother with no passengers, milady.
I'm on the baggage coach.
We take valuables, not human souls.
I see.
Do you sometimes guard really precious freight?
Aye, I do, that.
Gold and bullion and all.
Well, that sounds most exciting.
When do you do your next important journey?
Well, milady... we're not supposed to say, like.
But it's all right telling you. Thursday.
Gold for a London bank.

Caroline, why are you crying?
I can't bear to see you so unhappy.
I don't deserve happiness after what I did to you.
You couldn't help it.
A man can help doing what he knows to be wrong.
But it wasn't wrong for you to marry the woman you loved.
It would been if you hadn't to yourself... to her, to me.
I don't love Barbara.
- I know now I never did.
- Then why...
How can one explain a moment of madness?
Why I could ever have believed that I loved her...
- or that I didn't love you.
- But Ralph...
I realized it when it was too late.
I gone on realizing it.
I love you, Caroline.
- You mean you're, you're fond of me.
- No.
I love you.
I long to hold you in my arms, to have you with me always.
Oh, I lived all my life for this moment.
Say that again.
Look at me and say it again.
I lived all my life for this moment.
You love me too?
Ever since I can remember.
Then why... why did you make it so easy for me to marry Barbara?
Because I love you.
You make me feel ashamed.
No, Ralph.
- If you're thinking of Barbara feelings...
- She has no feelings.
- Then why...
- I'm thinking of us.
We're not made for deceit and intrigue.
I'll get a divorce.
Perhaps one day that may be easier, but you know how impossible it is now.
I'll apply to the ecclesiastical courts.
And get a private bill passed by both houses of Parliament... and the royal assent?
No, Ralph.
You're blamed for so much as it is.
Think what your enemies would make of a real scandal.
But we're entitled to fight for our happiness.
The things you stand for are more important than us.
We must part.
- Caroline, no.
- We must.
Now that we know we love each other.
Where will you go?
To Uncle Martin in London.
Good night, Ralph.
Goodbye.
No, my darling, please.
Please don't make our parting more difficult.
Aren't you ever satisfied?
Frequently, my sweet, but never frequently enough.
One can have a surfeit, even of passion.
When I'm with you, it's like enjoying a meal prepared by the gods.
I eat and I eat until I can't face another morsel.
And then?
Then I look at you again, and before I know it...
I'm clamoring for another helping.
Isn't every highwayman who has a lady of quality for his doxy.
Doxy, indeed.
- You're content with the arrangement?
- Content?
Gives me a partner on the road and an armful of... hungry passion for my leisure hours.
- Yes, I'm content.
- You never long for other armfuls?
You're the only one I want, thank you.
Keep to that.
If you ever deceive me, you'll find me a dangerous enemy.
I sometimes think you're a dangerous partner.
Why?
This plan of yours to hold up the gold coach, I don't like it.
- Oh.
- The odds are against us.
You know they double the night guards on those coaches.
That makes it doubly exciting.
To filch the gold from under their very noses, it's a job worthy of our skill.
I'm not one of your storybook highwaymen.
I don't boast that the more dangerous the task, the better I like it.
- Life is too sweet.
- You're afraid.
We'll come to the gibbet soon enough.
Don't let's race for it.
If you won't do it, I will.
- Alone?
- Yes.
I believe you would too, you green eyed devil.
So I ups and says...
Pussy is drunk baby milk.
And what do you think the little fella did?
- I'm no hand at riddles.
- He sat up in his cradle... and lobbed his bottle straight at the cat.
Reach for your guns and you're dead men.
Keep your hands up.
- Back to back.
- Come on. Jump.
Go.
Over with the others.
Drop your hands, all of you.
You boys look very pretty.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
- That's as much as we can carry.
- Oh, just one more.
I heard you say that in other circumstances.
One of them is following us, blast his soul.
We'll outdistance him.
Not with this damned gold we're carrying.
Aim low. Hit the horse.
Ned. Ned, I didn't mean to hurt you.
I aimed at the horse. At the horse.
Your voice...
Milady.
- Mila...
- Ned, Ned...
- Is he dead?
- Yes.
- I told you to shoot the horse.
- We got the gold, haven't we?
- Yes, but...
- It's worth killing a man for, isn't it?
Murder and gold robbery near Waterbrook Farm... in the parish of Maiden Worthy was committed by two men.
Robbery on the highway to the value of £ 1, 130.
Likewise, the said robbers murdered
Edward Cotterill, one of the guards.
Whoever shall deliver the said felons to Sir Ralph Skelton... of Maryiot Cells, Maiden Worthy, in the county of Buckinghamshire... shall have their charges and £30 reward... with a further £20 to be paid on conviction... of the robber who committed the murder.
So I'm valued at £20 more than Jackson.
No wonder he's furious.
Who is it?
Oh, Hogarth.
Well, what do you want?
Is this your handkerchief, my lady?
It looks like it. Why?
I found it near the spot... where poor Ned Cotterill was murdered.
Well, one of the maids must've stolen it.
I won't tolerate dishonest servants.
May the Lord have mercy on your unclean soul.
Hogarth. How dare you.
There I was, kneeling before my maker... praying for the dear departed, when my eye fell... on this bloodstained trifle.
Bloodstained?
My soul was tortured with a terrible suspicion.
So I turned to the Lord for counsel.
He told me to observe your movements, and I did.
You spied on me?
Never was a woman more subtle in craft.
But the Lord cannot be deceived... and first one thing and then another was revealed to me.
- What do you mean?
- I seen you going... to that den of iniquity, the Leaping Stag Inn.
Seen you by the lakeside with your highwayman lover.
Hogarth.
God cleanse my soul...
I watched you riding forth together on your evil errands... witnessed your return with your ill gotten gains... entering by the secret passage leading to your room.
My own beloved master wife... a murderess, an adulteress, and a thief.
You're suffering from delusions.
You don't know what you're saying.
My lady, I wrestled with my conscience, asking myself... whether it was my duty to hand you to justice... or whether I should consider the noble family whose name you bear... hoping that under heaven providence...
I might be the means of calling you to repentance... and so save your sin sick soul from the eternal fire.
What have you decided, Hogarth?
What have you decided?
Alas, that you're too far sunk... in evil and perfidy... beyond the scope of my poor efforts to reform.
This highwayman has me in his power.
He's forced me to rob, to deceive my husband.
He swears that if I break away... he'll wash his hands in my blood, as he did with poor Ned Cotterill.
You had no hand in that most foul crime?
No, no. I...
Oh, I may have been weak and wicked, but, but not that.
Hogarth, I know true goodness when I see it.
You are good and strong.
You alone can save me.
Help me, Hogarth. Help me to save my soul.
Poor, wretched sinner.
My heart swells with pride... that the Lord should entrust his humble servant with such a mission.
I knew you were truly good.
I must save your soul from eternal damnation.
Rise to your feet, my lady.
The hard ground is good enough for me.
You promise to lead a pure and blameless life?
With all my heart.
And never to communicate with that evil highwayman again?
Never. Never.
Then no other living soul shall ever know your shameful secret.
You swear it, Hogarth? By the Bible?
Your secret shall go with me to the grave.
Holy Spirit may direct and rule our hearts... and that we may continue his faithful servants... this day and unto our life end.
O God, by whom the whole world... is governed and preserved... we give to thee humble thanks... for thy fatherly care over us, beseeching thee... to make us truly sensible of thy mercies... and thankful for them.
Give us grace that we may walk as in thy sight... making a conscience of our way and fearing...
This column has the household items... and here is the list of servants' wages, the outdoor staff...
No more today, good Hogarth.
My mind is too full of other things.
Sometimes I doubt if heaven will ever forgive me.
There shall be more joy in heaven... over one sinner that repenteth... than over ninety and nine that are pure.
You comfort me, Hogarth.
What should I do without you?
Let me give you some of my homemade fruit cordial.
I should like your opinion of the flavor.
Thank you, my lady.
Excellent, my lady.
Just like Mistress Caroline used to make.
It's practically the same recipe.
Is there been any news of her since she went to London?
Not that I know of.
I'm told the city is in the grip of a great frost.
People skating on the River Thames.
Skating and sinning, no doubt.
Yes, Hogarth.
Sinning and skating.
I think I'm improving.
I like to try by myself.
Be careful to fall on a soft spot.
I intend to stay on my feet.
Thank you. It was lucky you were here.
Very lucky for me.
- Are you all right, Caroline?
- Yes, quite all right. This gentleman...
- Why, hello, Locksby.
- How are you sir?
Well, well. This is an undersized world.
My dear, may I present Mr. Kit Locksby.
My niece, Mistress Caroline.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I think we can assume we met.
- My dear, perhaps I better take you home.
- No, please sir.
The Thames isn't frozen every day.
You like to stay, wouldn't you?
- Well, I...
- Do, my dear.
Young Locksby will take better care of you than ever I can on these confounded things.
I'll do my best sir.
When you bring her home, I'll have something warm to cheer you up.
Speaking for myself,
I'm in excellent spirits.
Cheeky young devil. Wastes no time.
I remember. Maryiot Cells, that's where I saw you.
- Did you?
- Skelton wedding.
- You were one of the bridesmaids.
- Yes.
She's very lovely, isn't she?
Lady Skelton, I mean.
Yes.
Very lovely.
I a grove in fair Seville.
It's all for you. Just say you will.
How did you happen to be at the wedding?
Are you a friend of Sir Ralph?
No, I came out to look at some cottages he wanted rebuilt for the tenants.
Chestnuts. Spanish chestnuts.
Lovely hot chestnuts.
Oh, buy some for the pretty lady.
They will warm the cockles of her heart... if it needs warming.
Oh, yes. I remember. Ralph told me.
You must be the young architect who left so suddenly after the wedding.
Yes, something happened.
I, I had to change my plans.
Buy an orange for the lovely lady sir.
- They're fresh and sweet.
- Like the lady.
Roll up, roll up in your thousands... to witness the greatest cockfight of the century.
There is not an Englishman or woman... who miss this famous spectacle.
You interested?
No, I hate cruelty.
That's unusual in a woman.
Well, my character is influenced by an unusually gentle man.
Roll up, roll up in your thousands.

I'm in love with someone else. I told you.
- I told you the same thing.
- Well, then?
The point is, they're both unobtainable.
You can't go on chasing shadows forever.
Oh, damn.
- Is it all settled?
- Not quite sir.
Oh. Well, keep at her, my boy.
I got a letter for you. It's marked urgent, so I came along to find you.
Oh. Forgive me.
Oh.
- Anything wrong, my dear?
- Hogarth is ill.
Barbara is looking after him.
The house is in chaos.
Ralph asked me to come back and help.
Couldn't those old women do it between them?
Oh, they have. That's why it's in chaos.
Oh, poor Hogarth.
He's such a dear old man.
Thank you, my lady.
You're like Dorcas... and the ministering women of the scriptures.
Try to sleep a little.
If I'm going to meet my maker...
I want to be prepared.
What did the physician say, my lady?
He doesn't quite know what ails you.
None of us do. But with careful nursing... he hopes to have you out of bed within a month.
No man could have a better nurse than you, my lady.
There is real goodness in you... for all your mistakes.
Now try to sleep.
The Lord said unto them, wWhy sleep ye?
Rise and pray, lest ye enter temptation.
I say sleep, Hogarth.
Sleep.
Oh, look. The Skeltons coach.
- Lady Skelton herself.
- Oh?
All the ladies of quality patronize Mrs. Munce.
Good morning, milady.
Pray what can I show Your Ladyship?
I have the sweetest collection of lace pinners from Paris.
Pray serve your other customers, Mrs. Munce.
As Your Ladyship wishes.
Good morning, Lady Skelton. How is Sir Ralph?
- Quite well, I thank you.
- And dear Mistress Caroline?
- In London.
- Only on a visit, of course.
For good, I fear.
Now, can I interest Your Ladyship in my collection of scented gloves?
A very nice range of colors.
I didn't come here to buy gloves Mrs. Price.
Come in here.
Not that name, milady. I told you so before.
Price was the name Captain Jackson used... when he gave me details of your criminal career.
- What do you want?
- The poison you gave me was not enough.
I must've a further supply.
And this time, there must be no doubt.
Caroline. What are you doing here?
Didn't you know?
Ralph sent for me to look after the house while you're nursing Hogarth.
Oh. Oh, I see.
If you like me to sit up with him while you get some rest...
No, thank you.
Please leave Hogarth entirely to me.
My lady. My lady.
What is it, Hogarth?
I was afraid you wouldn't come in time.
I'm going, my lady. I'm going.
Drink this. You'll feel better.
I'm not afraid to meet my maker.
It's you I'm troubled about.
What will you do... without my spiritual guidance?
I don't know, Hogarth.
Drink this and get well.
I fear you're not strong enough... to bear the burden alone.
Let me tell Sir Ralph, my lady.
He's a good man.
He'll help you when I'm gone.
No, Hogarth.
You'll tell no one.
God in heaven.
What is it, Hogarth?
I know.
I know.
Help. Sir Ralph.
Sir Ralph.
- Fetch Sir Ralph.
- Yes, Mistress Caroline.
Quiet. Quiet.
Good Hogarth, you must be quiet.
- Sir Ralph, quick. I must tell...
- He's coming.
He's wandering in his mind.
He can talk to Ralph when he's rested.
He's dying. Anybody can see that.
- Caroline, what is it?
- Oh, Ralph, quickly.
Hogarth needs you. He's dying.
- You should left him to me.
- Or to us.
- Between...
- Quiet.
What he say?
He's so weak I can't hear.
Well, let me talk to him.
I'm used to his voice.
Keep them back, Ralph. He needs quiet.
Oh.
I tried to hear but, but it was too late.
Her ladyship is worn out nursing poor old Hogarth.
What she needs is complete rest.
Caroline will stay with you.
Yes, I will.
No, please. You all been so good to me... but I think I could sleep now if you left me alone.
We'll go at once. Good night, Barbara.
I deeply appreciate all you did for Hogarth.
I wish I could have done more.
Complete rest. The old fool.
If he only knew what it feels like to be free again.
- Is Captain Jackson here?
- Oh, yes, he's here.
In his usual room.
And I'll wager he's in bed.
- Won't he be surprised to see me?
- Yes, he'll be surprised.
- Oh.
- Barbara.
Where you been all these months? I missed you. I never thought you come tonight.
- Obviously.
- Oh, her. She's, she's nothing to me.
Just a wench I brought to pass the time till you came back.
- Here.
- You look very well together.
I warned you if ever you deceived me, you be sorry.
You'll find this wench, cheap though she looks, will cost you dear.
- Barbara.
- Farewell till our next merry meeting.
- Hey, what is that doxy doing...
- Get out.
If you would catch the notorious highwayman Jerry Jackson... he's harbored tonight at the Leaping Stag Inn.
- Some more beer, Ralph?
- Thank you, Henrietta.
- Another chop, Barbara?
- No.
You're making a very poor breakfast, my dear.
I don't think our London air can agree with you.
My London air too.
Don't forget I was born and bred here.
Bred?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
This fellow Jackson can't complain of his notoriety.
The Gazette calls him... the most popular gallows bird in the last 20 years.
He's very lucky with the weather.
Must be depressing to be hanged on a damp day.
I see they give you all the credit for his capture, Ralph.
They're wrong. Most of it should go to the accomplice who betrayed him.
I'll wager he's shaking in his shoes till the hanging is over.
Why should he?
Jackson didn't betray him at the trial.
Probably saving it up for his dying confession.
They all like to make a show on the gallows.
I wonder if the accomplice will be there in the crowd.
You bet your life on it. Couldn't keep away.
I do wish I could be there.
I wonder if I dare put off my fitting for my new gown.
No, I haven't got a thing to wear for the court ball.
What a nuisance. You go.
You can tell me all about it.
Sorry. Got to see a man about a horse.
Oh. You then, Ralph.
I don't share the popular view of hanging as a form of entertainment.
What about you, Barbara?
Wouldn't you adore to see him dangling... and hear his last minute confession?
You gone as white as a sheet.
Don't you feel well?
No, it's, it's just one of my headaches.
I think I'll take the air.
If you'll have my carriage ordered...
Sure you wouldn't like me to accompany you?
Quite sure, thank you.
I told James to keep well away from Tyburn.
- Good morning, Ralph.
- Why, Caroline. How are you?
I'm very well. I heard you were both in town.
Good morning, Barbara.
Where are you off to so early?
- Just to take the air.
- May I come with you?
No, really. You stay and entertain Ralph.
Oh, but it's you I came to see.
Goodbye, Ralph.
Goodbye.
Why did you force yourself on me?
Barbara, I must talk to you.
- The last time we discussed Ralph...
- When you attacked me.
Yes, I'm sorry.
I was angry at what you said about him and me.
I don't know why I said it.
I didn't and still don't care what you do together.
That isn't true. You were in love with Ralph and could be again. I'm sure of it.
I realize my staying on after the marriage was an awful mistake.
- It wasn't fair to either of you.
- Why go over the dreary past?
But it isn't the past I'm thinking of.
It's now and the future.
I do so want you and Ralph to be happy together.
Suppose you stop interfering in our lives?
I'm going to.
You see, Barbara, I'm going to be married.
Am I supposed to dance with glee?
No. I just wanted you to know.
I thought it might help you both.
- James.
- Milady?
Turn the horses towards Tyburn.
But milady, the master orders were to...
My orders are turn the horses towards Tyburn... and get there in time for the hanging.
Barbara, why did you come here?
Well, I never seen an execution.
It will be a new sensation.
I don't want to see it.
It will be your turn next.
Goodbye.
Cheer up. Enjoy yourself like the rest of them.
- Good luck, Jerry.
- Hello, Norma.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Can't wear two of these.
Who wants a nice cravat?
Mind you boys don't fall down and hurt yourselves.
We're safer than what you are.
My friends.
My friends, I don't care whether you're for me or against me.
All that matters is that you come here in your thousands... to give me a grand send off.
To the lovely ladies...
I say don't waste your love... your caresses, your tears... on villains like me.
Save them for someone who is worth it, a faithful, honest man... if you can find one.
To the men I say... never put your faith in a woman.
For however much you may think she loves you... like as not she'll betray you in the end.
In my short and merry life...
I loved them all, but I only once... made the fatal mistake of trusting one of them.
That's why I'm here now.
For believe me... only a woman hand would've put a halter round the neck... of Lucky Jerry Jackson.
God save your soul, Jerry.
May God bless all my friends.
And may my enemies be hanged as I am.
Excuse me, madam.
That, that unfortunate highwayman... struggling for dear life there asked me to give you this letter.
Well, my bold, bad Barbara... so you're afraid of me at last.
You needn't be.
We had some good sport together... and Jerry Jackson is not the man to whine now the reckoning has to be paid.
You'll have to pay yours too. Never fear.
In the meantime, if you feel you owe me some kindness... give a share of our earnings to the girl by my coffin.
She was with me that night at the inn.
She was my doxy before I ever met you... and she's stood by me ever since.
Farewell, then, my lovely Barbara... till our next merry meeting.
Oh, it seems he thought I had a kind face... and asked me to help that poor girl over there.
Give her this and tell her
I'm very sorry for her.
Thank you, madam, in the name of true Christian charity.
- May I read the letter?
- You may not.
Barbara, there is something behind all this.
- Why should he choose you?
- I don't want her money.
I don't want no charity from fine ladies in fine carriages.
I remember you.
- You were the doxy that was dressed as a...
- Hey, you. Get out.
Hello. What is going on over there?
Caroline. Hey, Ted, Frank, quickly.
Drive on.
Caroline, are you all right?
I couldn't believe, you.
Anyone would've been welcome at a time like this, but... this is like magic.
I'm most grateful. You managed to avert a very unpleasant situation.
Just lucky I happened to see Caroline at the window of the coach.
I can't think what you were doing there.
However, it's all turned out for the best.
You must come back with us to Maryiot Cells... to take over those building plans again.
That's very good of you.
Not at all, now you're to be one of the family.
- One of the family?
- Didn't you know?
Caroline and Mr. Locksby are going to be married.
No.
No, I didn't know.
- You'll come too, Caroline.
- You won't entice Caroline.
She finds Maryiot Cells rather dull.
- I don't think I'll find it dull this time.
- My lord... there is a person here who says he's...
- Sir Ralph, the highwayman, Jackson.
- What about him?
A riot started round one of the coaches... and in the excitement, his friends managed to cut him down... and get his body away before the doctor had time to examine it.
- You mean he might not have been dead?
- It's just a chance.
Lucky Jerry Jackson, all right.
Barbara.
Oh. Oh, it's you.
Why are you looking so worried?
It's nothing.
It's wonderful to be able to talk to you at last.
Ever since we been down here,
I scarcely dared look at you... for all the watching eyes.
What are you thinking?
I feel my life is slipping away like the water down there.
Useless, wasted.
- I wish I could help you.
- Oh, but you do.
You do.
Anything would be safe in your hands... a bird, a horse's mouth or a woman's heart.
Kit, if only I met you sooner...
I never have married Ralph.
You're the only person except my mother that I ever really cared about.
- I love you.
- And I love you.
- Oh, Barbara.
- Nothing matters but you. Nothing.
I want to be everything to you.
I want to love you, to make you happy.
Oh, darling.
- But soon I'll be returning to London.
- Don't let's talk about the future.
It's now that matters.
We must be together, just once.
Tonight when everybody is...
Barbara, we couldn't.
Kit, please.
I want to talk to you, Locksby.
Yes, of course.
But wouldn't it do in the morning?
What I have to say won't wait.
- It's about my wife.
- Sir Ralph, I assure you...
I don't blame you, Locksby.
Barbara is a beautiful woman... and she's pursued you ever since you been here.
That is untrue. Any pursuing, as you call it, is been by me.
You may believe that.
I know her better.
Sir Ralph, I'm very weary. Couldn't we please discuss this in the morning?
In the morning you'll be leaving Maryiot Cells.
Tonight I want your promise that you'll never see Barbara again.
And if I don't give it?
Then I shall be obliged to defend my wife honor.
I see.
You seem to have forgotten you're engaged to Caroline.
I seen her robbed once, and I'm damned if I'm going to let it happen again.

Jackson.
So you did escape.
- What do you want?
- Well.
What a question to ask an old friend... just back from the grave.
What do you think I want?
You think it was me who betrayed you, but it wasn't. It...
Come, come. That isn't worthy of you.
You always had the courage of your iniquity.
- What are you going to do?
- Ah.
What would you do to someone who sold you to the hangman?
You don't know what it feels like to be strangled, do you... my lady?
It's an experience we ought to share.
You feel the rope crushing your windpipe, choking the life out of you... and the whole world goes black with spots of vivid color... flashing against the awful darkness.
You feel as if your head is going to burst... as you kick and struggle and squirm.
It's quite an experience to have had and survived.
After my friends had cut me down... it took them two hours to bring me round, and I had a hell of a sore throat.
How did you find me?
Easy, once I seen you in your coach with the Skelton arms.
I laughed when I learned that the lady of the manor... was a certain Lady Barbara.
- But the secret passage...
- I searched the grounds.
Once I found the entrance,
I knew it lead to you.
And now that you found me?
We're going to pick up our life together just where we left off.
What do you mean?
I meant to kill you at first.
Then I began to remember those crisp, clear nights... when we rode together.
The thrill of the hours that followed... when you put aside your trappings of the road and lay in my arms... warm, yielding, lovely.
I knew then that it wasn't vengeance that I wanted.
- It was you.
- No.
- No.
- Have I suddenly become so distasteful?
Things are different now.
I'm in love. Deeply, sincerely in love.
And my caresses would be repulsive?
I told you, I'm in love.
It will be a new experience to take you against your will.
You wouldn't.
- You underrate me.
- I'll call for help.
And give yourself away? No, Barbara.
You're as much in my power as if we were on a desert island.
No. No, please. Please.
This must be what they mean when they say revenge is sweet.
Kit. Kit.
My darling, what is it?
Take me away from here.
Right away. Please, darling.
- Tell me, Barbara: What is happened?
- I can't.
Can't. But you must take me away, out of England, anywhere, now.
Dearest, how can I? My work is here.
We have no money, no friends.
Kit, I love you.
I face want, hardship, anything with you.
I got to get away from this life.
I want a home, children... all the things I never thought would matter.
It would be wonderful, but it's impossible.
Why?
Ralph is made me see how shamefully I'm behaving to him... and to Caroline.
Caroline. Oh, you can't love that sentimental little fool.
Please, Barbara. I'm deeply fond of Caroline, and I have asked her to marry me.
Kit, this is our chance.
If we throw it away, we'll be unhappy for the rest of our lives. You must take me away.
My dear, we mustn't let love blind us to our duty.
I leave in the morning.
Ralph is driving me and Caroline to London.
- Darling. Darling, please.
- My dear, it's no use.
It be different if you weren't married, if there were no Ralph.
Yes.
Yes, it, it would be different.
Good evening, my lady of iniquity.
What are you doing here?
- What do you want?
- To renew our partnership of the road.
I told you last night I hate you.
But I'm thrilled by you.
Be warned, Jackson:
Keep out of my way.
Tut, tut. That's no way to talk to a partner.
What is this job we're doing?
There will be a coach along here in a few minutes.
- Worthwhile?
- To me.
- After something special?
- A man life.
What is this?
Some new devil trick?
I never did like killing, less since I felt the stench of death in my nostrils.
- You still got time to go.
- What is this poor devil done to you?
He stands between me and everything I want.
- Who is it?
- My husband.
You cold blooded fiend.
I ached to ride and rob with you again... but I no stomach for your kind of evil.
- I finished with you, Barbara.
- Have you?
Aye. And if ever I want another partner,
I'll choose a weasel or a viper.
Something reasonably friendly.
- Where are you going?
- To warn your husband.
Captain Jackson.
Now we both had our revenge.
To our next merry meeting... in hell.
What do you think that shot was?
Probably a poacher after rabbits.
Nothing to be afraid of.
I'm not afraid of anything now.
Won't Barbara be surprised to see us back?
No more surprised than I am to be bringing you back.
If you hadn't given such a convincing performance... of being in love with this young scoundrel... we could all have been saved a tiring journey.
But it's a lovely journey. Isn't it, Kit?
I must say I like a little more speed.
If you let the cat out of the bag before we reached London, we could have gone back in daylight.
Personally, I got nothing against the moon.
We're being very lighthearted.
How do you think we can arrange things?
I don't know yet, but there is no reason why four people... should pass their lives in misery when they could all be so happy.
I'll see to it that you get your Barbara... and I get my heart desire... if it takes 50 Acts of Parliament.
Halt.
Out into the road.
- I been wanting to meet you.
- This is your last chance.
Kit. Let's get on.
Well, I winged the fellow.
Where is her ladyship?
Went to bed early sir, with one of her headaches.
She asked not to be disturbed.
I think this is an occasion on which we might disobey instructions, don't you?
No. Let me go.
Very well. It's also an occasion for a drink.
Barbara?
Barbara.
Barbara.
Oh, William?
William, I think her ladyship may be ill.
- Can you break down the door?
- I'll try, Mistress Caroline.
It's all right, William.
I'll send for a doctor.
It's no use.
I'm finished.
It was Kit.
I was going to give my life to him.
Strange he should take it away.
Another?
As you say sir, this is an occasion.
What shall be the toast?
Mine is to Barbara.
Barbara had an accident.
She's dying.
She wants to see Kit.
Barbara.
Kit.
- Darling, what happened?
- It was an accident.
An old pistol I kept for protection.
Have they sent for a doctor?
It's no use.
We so little time.
- Don't let's waste it.
- But my darling...
Kit, take me in your arms.
Hold me close.
She's not only a highwayman, but a murderess.
- Oh, no, she...
- I'm afraid there is no doubt.
But what can have happened to her?
She used to be so sweet and lovely.
Who can tell what strange things go on in the human mind?
Loving you is been the one good thing in my life.
Everything in your life is been good, I stake my soul on that.
Oh, go on believing it.
Then it doesn't matter what the others think.
No.
No.
I can't cheat you as I cheated everyone else.
I got to tell you the truth.
- Darling...
- I'm wicked.
All my life I cheated to get what I wanted.
And then my punishment is been I no longer wanted it.
You're delirious, my darling.
If we met sooner,
I never have done these wicked things.
I had to have excitement.
That's why I took to the road.
But I wouldn't have killed anybody who hadn't stood in my way.
Killed?
Ned, Hogarth, Jackson... and tonight, my husband.
- You saved him, you shot me instead.
- You?
The highwayman?
Kit... don't look like that.
It was for you.
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me alone.
Kit.
It's so dark.
So cold.
Take me in your arms.
Hold me close.
Kit.
Kit, I'm frightened.
I don't want to die alone.
Kit, don't let me die... alone.
When she came, a dark shadow crept over our lives.
But it's lifting, we shall ride again in the sunshine... sing and laugh and know happiness and love.
- Code message, sir.
- Thanks.
- Harper, code message.
- Yes, sir.
All right, everything clear to the pilots?
- Major Roberts.
- Yes, Quincannon?
- Gonna use the radio beam all the way?
- Yes.
Flight leaders will work Hickam radio control...
...while the other planes work the home station. How about the navigators?
- One question, sir.
- How soon...?
- Sorry.
- Hauser?
How soon will we get our maps and charts, sir?
Anytime you want them. You'll be given the route weather forecast soon.
- Wendell?
- That's what I wanted to know, sir.
Any questions from the bombardiers?
- Major Roberts, sir.
- Parker.
- What about ammunition?
- No ammunition.
- Yes, McMartin?
- Are we taking bombsights along?
We're ferrying them fully equipped except for ammunition.
Maintenance crews are working on them.
Pilots, check with them to be sure everything's in shape.
- And Harper, you'll check for us.
- Yes, sir.
I guess that's all for now.
Oh, yes. The crews haven't been told yet what the destination is, so keep it quiet.
- Anything else?
- How about phoning our wives, sir?
Evidently your copilot doesn't take you into his confidence.
He got permission to send a radiogram to Lieutenant McMartin's sister in Honolulu.
I thought that might interest you,
McMartin.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I guess that's about all.
We'll meet here 30 minutes before takeoff time for final instructions.
- How's everything, sergeant?
- Everything's going fine, sir.
Gotta put a new magneto on number two.
Gear's shot.
They told me to get her ready for a long trip.
- They didn't tell me where.
- They didn't, huh?
- No, sir.
- Can you keep a secret, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
- That's good.
Captain Quincannon?
Private Chester reporting, sir.
Second radio.
Sergeant White, your crew chief.
- How are you?
- How do you do?
- Glad to have you with us.
- I'm glad to be assigned to your airplane.
I've been hoping to get on a Flying Fortress since radio school.
- How long ago was that?
- Three months ago.
I've had experience.
I've been in light bombers.
That's fine.
Better turn him over to Peterson, sergeant.
He can look over the radio set and get the hang of things.
- I'll be in Operations if you want me.
- Yes, sir.
You'll find Peterson inside, son.
- Must be a big flight. Nine Fortresses.
- So they say.
Do you know...?
I mean, can you tell me where we're going?
- Can... Can you keep a secret?
- Oh, yes, sir.
That's good.
- Hello.
- Hello. Are you the new gunner?
- No, second radio.
- Yeah?
- My name's Weinberg, second engineer.
- Chester's my name. Glad to know you.
- Glad to know you.
- Hey, is that what they call her, Mary-Ann?
That's her.
And she's the best ship in the outfit.
Hey, Peterson, here's your new static chaser.
- My name's Chester.
- How are you?
Come on, I'll show you around.
- Hey, you the crew chief?
- Yeah.
My name's White.
Are you the new gunner?
Yeah, Winocki. Joe Winocki.
We've been expecting you.
Put your stuff inside.
- Okay.
- You're lucky.
- Our regular gunner's on furlough.
- I wouldn't say I'm lucky.
- Looks like everything's okay, sergeant.
- I think so, sir.
- How about coffee and sandwiches?
- Got them, sir.
- I wish we could get ahold of extra oxygen.
- Already inside the plane, sir.
- How'd you do that?
- Six bottles.
- You haven't got an extra engine, have you?
- Almost enough parts to build one, I guess.
I'm getting sort of worried about my wife.
She should be here by now.
Oh, Winocki.
- Yeah?
- This is our new gunner, sir.
Captain Quincannon.
- Don't I know you, sergeant?
- I think you do, sir.
- You were at Randolph Field?
- That's right.
- About two years ago?
- Two and a half, sir.
- While I was instructing there.
- That's right.
- Oh, I remem...
- I think you remember.
- Anything else, sir?
- Not now, no.
Anyhow, I guess that new radioman of ours is a pretty good kid.
- Yeah, I guess he is.
- We're getting them right off the bottle.
We were all pretty young when we started out.
How old is that kid of yours you talk about?
- Twenty-one.
- Where is he stationed?
Clark Field, Manila.
They got him in one of those Peashooters.
Just got a boost too.
If he gets another bar on his shoulders, you're gonna have to have a bigger head.
- Imagine me saluting my own kid.
- You'd pin his ears down if he didn't take it.
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind if...?
Well, my mother would like to meet you.
Sure.
Mother, this is Captain Quincannon.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Mighty nice of you to turn out at this time of night to see us off.
I wanted to meet you, captain, because...
...well, I couldn't help wondering what kind of a...
- You'll take good care of him, won't you?
- In a way, he'll be looking after me.
That's the way the crew of a bomber functions.
- I wouldn't worry any.
- I won't.
We haven't much time left, Chester.
Don't worry about our radioman.
It's a routine flight.
- He'll be back in a couple of weeks.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Chester.
- Goodbye.
I'll write to you, Mom, so you'll know where I am.
Did you bring this for me?
Take care of yourself, Mom.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.
Goodbye, son.
Goodbye, Mom.
Haven't seen Mrs. Quincannon, have you?
- I haven't. I've been watching, sir.
- Well, I guess I've been ditched.
- You better get aboard, Chester.
- Yes, sir.
Irish!
- Irish.
- It's about time, Mrs. Quincannon.
- Did you have another date?
- Flat tire. You ever try to get a taxi here?
- I was scared I wouldn't make it.
- So was I.
And I couldn't bring Michael. It's a little too late for him, but he sent you this.
And this.
Thanks.
- Darling, couldn't I stow away?
- Do you wanna get me court-martialed?
I'll be back in a couple weeks.
We'll take time off for that honeymoon.
I remember every honeymoon we didn't have. Even the first one.
So do I.
You haven't got much chance to be bored with me.
Oh, I'll never get bored with you, Irish.
It's been fun, every minute of it.
Such good fun.
- I guess I'm just lucky.
- Me too.
Irish, when you go out in the rain, you'll remember to wear your rubbers, won't you?
Sure, I will.
I'll be waiting.
So long, kid.
- Better stow this stuff over there, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
- Get that ladder aboard, will you, Weinberg?
- Okay.
- Hey, what's that thing for?
- You never know where your luck is.
That's from
Michael Aloysius Quincannon, Jr.
- Everybody in?
- Yes, sir.
- Doors closed?
- Yes, sir.
- Lockpins out?
- Yes, sir.
- Check controls for free movement.
- Check.
- Roberts to flight, check-in in order.
- Two ready.
- Three okay.
- Four okay.
- Five okay.
- Eight ready.
- Nine okay.
- Okay, start engines.
All set here, sir.
- Only need one shot, sir. Kind of warm.
- Okay.
Number one.
Number two.
01104 to control tower.
Take-off instructions for flight of nine B-17s.
- Sir, is this a local flight?
- No, this is not a local flight.
Okay to taxi up to north end of ramp.
Use runway two-eight.
Wind west, one-five. Go ahead.
Roger.
Roberts to flight, all planes follow me.
Use runway 28. Wind west, 15 miles.
Take off at 30-second intervals.
Let's go.
- Looks like they're gonna run all right.
- Thank you, sir.
- Check the tail wheel, will you, Robbie?
- Yes, sir.
- I'm going upstairs.
- Okay, Tommy.
Don't get us lost.
Want any help running this thing?
- Hi, Tommy. How's Monk doing?
- Knee-deep in maps.
Well, looks like you got your date, all right.
They say that Hawaiian moon's awful big.
Better watch out, Tommy, or he'll be your brother-in-law.
No, Susan's a smart girl.
She won't marry beneath herself.
Go on, you can't make me mad.
Take a last look.
- Goodbye, San Francisco.
- Hello, Honolulu.
Hey, there's the Golden Gate.
Christmas crackers.
That's an awful big town, San Francisco.
Strictly a one-whistle stop.
There's only one city in the U.S.A.
And that's New York.
Oh, you're just another hometown hick,
Weinberg.
- What's wrong with California?
- California?
The sun shines and nothing ever happens.
Before you know it you're 60 years old.
It's no different from New York.
My sister's been trying to get out of Brooklyn for 40 years.
Brooklyn? That ain't New York.
Once you cross that Brooklyn Bridge, you're out of this world.
The only noise you hear is the hardening of your arteries.
When I used to drive a hack...
...I had a pal who crossed that bridge back in 1929.
- I ain't heard from him since.
- Me, I'll take Minneapolis.
Minneapolis?
Why, the grass still grows in the streets.
Besides, that ain't your hometown,
Peterson.
The hayseed's still sticking out of your hair.
Yeah, but I can still milk a cow.
I bet you can't.
I'll get mine out of a bottle. That's the closest I ever wanna be to a cow.
You're handy with the old bull.
Gee. Gee, we're sure lucky.
- Why? What do you mean?
- Oh, this whole trip.
Well, what about it?
Oh, a million fellas would give anything to be in our shoes right now.
Why?
I don't mean just this flight.
I mean, well...
Everything we've got to look forward to.
How far do you think you'll get as an enlisted man?
A lot of enlisted men get commissions.
Look at the training you get, and the experience too.
Look, if you don't go through flying school, you don't rate.
- I don't believe that.
- I know.
- Well, what are you in it for?
- Not for long.
I've had enough.
I'm getting out next month.
- You're getting out, huh?
- Yup.
- Well, I'm not.
- That's right, stay with it.
You stick to what you believe in, kid.
Don't listen to guys like him.
What are you gonna be in another 20 years, sergeant? A brigadier?
No. But my boy is.
Him and me sort of like the old Air Corps.
You stay in the box, son, and keep right on pitching.
Yeah.
Coming up forward, kid?
Yeah. Keep right on pitching.
- Everybody all right?
- Fine, sir.
- Good.
- Coffee, captain?
Yeah, please.
- Thanks, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- You want some coffee, Winocki?
- No, thanks.
- How's it going?
- All right, sir.
- I want to talk with you.
- Sure. Can I talk too?
Sure, go ahead. Get it off your chest.
- I want to get things straight with you.
- I think I'm straight.
- I don't know if you are, sir.
- I think I know what's bothering you.
- Do you?
- Yeah. And in a way, I don't blame you.
- You wanted to fly, be a pilot, didn't you?
- Who doesn't?
- You had your chance.
- Did I?
- Yeah. You blew it.
- That's what you think.
You couldn't make it. You scraped around a while. When the going got tough...
Yeah, and you threw me up for grabs.
I didn't run you into Driscoll's plane and cut his tail off.
- Oh, I know it was an accident, but...
- For which you washed me out of school.
I could have been flying one of these if it hadn't been for that.
I didn't wash you out, the board washed you out.
- On your recommendation.
- You lacked flying ability.
You should have been eliminated sooner.
I want you to know that nobody held you responsible for Driscoll's death.
- Except you, sir.
- Not me either.
Get that out of your head.
Now, look, Winocki...
...there are two other men on this ship who washed out as pilots.
McMartin's a bombardier, Hauser went in for navigation. They're both good.
You're a good gunner or you wouldn't have the rating.
We need you like we need the whole gang.
It takes all of us to make this ship function.
Now, get this into your head:
We all belong to this airplane.
Every man has got to rely on every other man to do the right thing at the right time.
You played football, Winocki.
You know how one man can gum up the whole works.
You gotta play ball with us, play the game, or I'm gonna get rid of you.
Nice speech.
But my enlistment runs out in three weeks.
- You're quitting, huh?
- Yes, sir.
Well, that's your privilege.
But until that time, you're still in the Army.
Don't you forget it.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry for you, Winocki.
- Anything else, sir?
- No, that's all.
Oh, Peterson, if you want entertainment, tune in on the broadcast frequencies.
- I'll stay on the command set.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
San Francisco. Mr. Litvinoff, the new
Russian ambassador to the United States...
... arrived yesterday
on the China Clipper...
... and departed immediately for the capital
to confer with the president.
Washington, D.C.
Tension in the Pacific and the Far East
has relaxed...
... as a result of the peaceful mission of
Japan's special envoy, Mr. Saburo Kurusu.
Mr. Kurusu and Admiral Nomura
have assured the press...
... that Japan's intentions
are wholly peaceful.
They will meet again tomorrow
with Secretary of State Cordell Hull.
Seattle, Washington.
A final labor conference
was held here this morning...
Weather report from Hickam Field, sir.
- Did you get a good sleep, Chester?
- Not much, sir.
I didn't wanna miss anything.
- How's the kid doing, sergeant?
- Fine, sir.
He likes the ship and I guess Mary-Ann likes him.
Good. How about Winocki?
I can't make him out.
No, sir.
Thanks, Chester.
Beg pardon, sir. Isn't that a picture of Captain Monk Hauser?
Yeah.
- Well, that's...
- My father.
Gosh, I'm pretty dumb.
I should have realized.
- Well, there's not much resemblance.
- Oh, sure there is. I can see it now.
I've seen him in a book I got about the Lafayette Escadrille.
- Yeah, he was in it.
- Yeah, he sure was.
- Gee, he could sure fly.
- Yeah.
I wish I could fly like him.
Yes, sir.
Well, it won't be long now before you see Diamond Head...
...sticking out of that ocean.
Suits Weinberg.
I used to dream about getting out of traffic jams...
...and going someplace where a guy would have elbow room.
But this is overdoing it.
Two thousand miles and I ain't seen a fish.
I kind of like it.
- Like being on the prairies when I was a kid.
- Funny thing.
I never thought there was nothing west of Manhattan except Jersey.
- I can use some of that coffee.
- I was just talking to the navigator.
- You know who his father was?
- Sure. Monk Hauser.
- Who's that?
- How old were you in the last war?
Older than you.
I was over on the other side.
And you never heard of Monk Hauser with Eddie Rickenbacker's squadron?
Well, what do you know?
Was that Lieutenant Hauser's old man?
That's him. I knew him. He was plenty good till they knocked him down.
Yeah, he sure was.
- Well, why ain't this kid of his a pilot?
- Tried too hard.
Yeah, like a lot of others.
- That's funny.
- What?
Hickam radio went off right in the middle of a weather report.
- Maybe it faded out.
- It didn't sound like it.
- What is it? What is it?
- Wait.
Hey, Peterson, who you got tuned in,
Orson Welles?
- Shut up.
- Now...
Shut up.
Better tell the captain.
Radio operator to pilot.
Radio operator to pilot.
- Go ahead.
- Sir, Hickam Field's off the air.
I don't know what I've picked up.
You can listen in on R-2.
- What's that?
- I don't know.
- Chinese?
- No, Japs.
Number four to Major Roberts.
Number four to Major Roberts.
Stand by, Irish. I hear it.
Keep off the air.
01104 to Hickam radio.
01104 to Hickam radio.
Hickam radio, answer.
Hickam radio, answer, please.
01104 to Hickam radio.
A flight of B- 17s to Hickam
want landing instructions.
Hickam radio, answer, please.
Give me landing instructions
for a flight of B- 17s.
Hickam radio, give me a call, please.
01104 to Hickam radio.
Silence your radio!
Keep away from the field!
We're being attacked by enemy aircraft.
We're being attacked by enemy aircraft.
Land elsewhere. Land elsewhere.
Roberts to flight.
We're going into emergency fields.
You know where they are.
I'll take the one furthest north, number nine, furthest south...
...the rest of you, in between.
Get on the ground and stay there till you're clear.
You're on your own.
Peterson, send the crew chief up here right away.
Get the rubber boats ready.
Pass out.45s and ammunition.
- Where do we go, Monk?
- Turn 120 degrees until I figure it out.
Okay, 120 degrees she is.
- I wish we were there.
- Yeah.
- If we only had machine-gun loads.
- I still got a throwing arm.
I'll heave a wrench if any of them come our way.
Get the rubber boats ready.
- Pass out side arms.
- I've done that.
- Tell everybody to keep their eyes open.
- Yes, sir.
Put your life vests on.
Keep an eye out upstairs, kid.
- Put your life vests on, boys.
- Hey, sarge, is this really on the level?
You guess.
Winocki,
I told you to put your life vest on.
Relax, sergeant.
This is some kind of drill, and you know it.
Personally, I wouldn't care if you left it off. Here.
Thanks, brigadier.
- Navigator to pilot.
- Go ahead.
Change course to 135. We ought to be on the ground at Maui in 22 minutes.
Right, 135.
This one really is smaller than a postage stamp.
Little more. That's about it.
- Looks like it here.
- Hold it there.
- Think it'll work, sergeant?
- It'll hold all right, sir.
- We gotta see if she'll retract.
- Because I made a mess out of the landing.
A wonder you got her in at all, sir.
This field wasn't built for the Mary-Ann.
Hey, captain, something's moving over there in the brush.
Why, it's the lieutenants.
- You fellas look like you've had a trip.
- We did.
- Yeah, where's the water?
- Right here.
- You find the other field?
- Yeah, but no ammunition.
- How many of our flight there?
- Two. Both of them okay.
- Hi, there, Tommy.
- Hi.
- That accounts for everybody.
- Yeah.
Two more landed at Molokai, and Roberts and the rest made Hickam.
- Cracked-up landing. Nobody was hurt.
- What have you heard?
- Nothing since noon.
- Sound bad at Hickam?
Doesn't sound good.
We had a little trouble ourselves on the way back.
- What?
- Somebody took a crack at us.
- What do you mean?
- Just that.
We saw men in a cane field and headed for them.
- They started popping away with rifles.
- Local Japs. Friendly fellas.
We lost them back there, three or four miles.
I hope you did.
- Better get back to your bombsight, Tommy.
- Yeah.
Step on it, sergeant.
- Douse that light! Let's get out of here!
- Knock those wedges out.
Winocki, cut it out.
Knock this one out first.
Got this one.
- All right, shove!
- Shove.
Everybody in the ship!
- How do we get out of this chicken yard?
- We got in, didn't we?
Hey, they ain't kidding.
Did you see that bumblebee?
- Lock it.
- Locked.
Check the tanks and see if they've been hit.
Yes, sir.
All right, all right. Let me alone.
- All right, all right.
- How are you feeling, Winocki?
- I owe you one for this.
- Yeah?
How far do you think you'd have gotten in that brush?
They'd have cut you down before you got to first base.
- Instead, you did it.
- Don't you know this is just a drill?
We could've had a fine scrap with them snipers.
Couple of shots in the right place could have set this ship afire.
Use your head, Winocki, and stop trying to prove something.
My job is tail gunner.
What's yours, lecturing?
No. My job is to keep this thing flying.
05564 to Hickam Field.
05564 to Hickam Field.
Shut off your radio. Stay where you are.
Don't get off the ground.
05564 to Hickam.
Just cleared emergency field on Maui.
- Have to come down.
- Okay.
- Give me a call just before you come in.
- Roger.
Pilot to crew.
Take a good look at Pearl Harbor.
Maybe it's something you'll want to remember.
Damn them. Damn them.
Now ain't you glad you're getting out of the Army?
05564 to Hickam.
- Go ahead.
- Approaching the field from the south.
- Coming in for a landing.
- We won't be able to give you any lights.
- I can get in without them.
- Take the west side near the hangars.
Watch out for bomb craters on the runway.
- Good luck to you.
- Roger.
Pilot to crew. Fasten your safety belts.
- Might be a rough landing.
- All set, sir.
All checked for landing.
- Give me full flaps.
- Flaps coming down.
- Landing lights.
- Lights.
Air speed 110.
One hundred.
- Captain Quincannon, sir.
- How are you, captain?
You made a good landing.
You were told to stay where you were.
- Yes, but we had to get out.
- Why?
- We were being shot at by snipers.
- At Maui?
- We didn't wanna lose the airplane.
- No, no, of course you didn't.
Didn't know about that.
You did the right thing, then.
Well, we've had our troubles around here too, as you can see.
Yes, sir.
They certainly did a complete job of it.
What happened to those P-40s?
Three trucks arrived from Honolulu this morning.
When the first Jap plane showed up, the trucks went down the field...
...smashed the tails off every ship on the land.
They sure had a field day.
Took the first round, but there'll be others.
- Yes, sir.
- Which one of you is McMartin?
- Me, sir.
- I have some bad news for you.
- You're wanted over at the hospital.
- My sister?
Sorry, I didn't get any details except that she asked for Williams and Quincannon too.
Captain, we'll want your ship serviced right away.
- Full gas load, ammunition for guns.
- Yes, sir.
Any repairs needed?
There's a wheel to be checked.
Everything else seems okay.
These men will give you everything.
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir?
You heard what the colonel said.
Anything else?
- This car will take you to the hospital.
- Thank you.
- Who's your navigator?
- I am, sir.
- Come with me. I have a job for you.
- Oh, colonel.
Beg your pardon, sir.
- Glad to see you again, sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
Did they attack Clark Field, Manila, sir?
- I've got a boy there.
- Yes, they hit it all right.
Hit everything in the Pacific.
Guam, Wake, Midway.
I remember your boy, sergeant.
- Twenty-seventh group.
- Yes, sir.
He's a first lieutenant now.
Flight commander.
He's a good pilot, then.
Don't worry. He'll take care of himself.
Thank you, sir. All right, fellas.
We got a job of work to do.
Let's get with it.
- Miss McMartin?
- Right down that way.
Thank you.
I can't see. Why is it so dark?
Hush, child. It's going to be all right.
But I can't see.
I can't see.
- Lieutenant McMartin?
- Yes, nurse.
You can only stay a few minutes.
She needs all the rest she can get.
Sure.
Sue.
Hello, kids.
Why, it's good to see you boys.
I was kind of scared.
I acted like a ninny.
We didn't know whether you had a flat tire or something...
...or couldn't find the place.
Or...
Tommy, Bill, I'm so glad you're here.
- Kind of hurts when I cry.
- Don't, Sue.
I wanted to tell you about...
But I guess I'm kind of tired.
- He'll tell you.
- Who?
Tex.
- Tex Rader.
- What?
Please don't get mad at him.
It was all my fault.
He tried to make me get out of the car, but...
- I guess he'd better tell you.
- Sure.
- Will you come in the morning?
- You bet.
Good night.
Sergeant, do you know where we can find Lieutenant Rader?
Yes, sir. Right this way.
Rader. Rader.
Oh, hello, Tommy.
- Quincannon. How are you, Bill?
- I've been waiting for you. I went to sleep.
We just came from the hospital.
- How is she?
- Not so good.
That's what we came to talk to you about.
- Suppose you do a little explaining.
- Yeah, go on, start.
- Say, what is this, the third degree?
- All right, she said it wasn't his fault.
Don't believe what she said.
It was my fault.
- Should've made her get out of the car.
- What car?
- The one I borrowed for the party.
- What party?
Give him a chance.
We were starting out when the first planes came.
- Couldn't figure it out.
- Up early, weren't you?
- Or out late.
- Listen, will you?
- Say, I don't get...
- Never mind, Rader. Go ahead.
We spotted the planes, and at the same time heard the bombs.
All I could think of was getting to the field.
I told Susan to hop out and get under cover, but she only laughed at me.
- You know how she is.
- Yeah, we know. Go on.
We got near the field, a truck pulled across, blocking the road ahead of us.
It was a delivery truck from Honolulu.
I remember thinking as I jumped out that the driver had been hit.
I was just dumb.
First thing I knew, there was an explosion right in my face.
There was a Jap behind the wheel with a shotgun.
It was a rotten shot. Sloughed him over the head with his own gun.
Got the truck off the road.
Other cars were coming along, trying to get to the field.
Was Susan all right then?
Yeah, but that's when
I should've made her get out.
She took the wheel and went carting off toward the hangars with me hanging on.
Last time I saw her, she was standing up in the car...
...yelling and rooting like she was at a football game.
- How'd she get hurt, then?
- Machine gun.
The soldier who ran out to drag her in was killed.
- What were you doing all that time?
- What do you think?
I notice you're not hurt any.
- Listen, wait a minute.
- Wait a minute, Tommy.
If I stay here, I'll...
Let's go.
- Say, you guys don't think...?
- See you later, Rader.
You wanted to see me, colonel?
- You find something to eat?
- Yes.
- How's your sister, McMartin?
- Pretty weak, sir.
The surgeon says it's hard to tell yet.
I'm going over again when he makes another examination.
No, you aren't. We want this airplane out of here before daylight.
- You're sending us back to the mainland?
- No, Manila.
We're safe here for the moment, and the Philippines are in bad shape.
Our orders are to send them as many B-17s as we can. Can you make it?
- Where do we stop to refuel, sir?
- Wake Island.
I can't promise you how long it'll hold out or what you'll find there.
- Got the charts there, Monk?
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant White.
- Yes, sir?
- How'd the engines rev up, sergeant?
- Number-three engine's a little rough, sir.
The men are pretty tired.
We'll overhaul it in the morning.
- We're taking off in two hours.
- Sir?
I think you're gonna see that son of yours soon.
- Manila?
- Can you get that engine running?
We'll have her hitting home runs in 90 minutes.
Tell the crew they can sleep in the next world.
- We'll make it all right, sir.
- Good luck. Take off when you're ready.
By the way, tell your passenger
I'll have some papers for him.
- What passenger, sir?
- Hasn't he reported yet?
- Manila needs pilots. You're taking one.
- Who, sir?
Lieutenant Rader.
- Did you say Rader?
- Yes, and he's a good man too.
Three fighters got off the ground this morning, and he was one.
Knocked off four Jap Zeros before they shot him down.
He'll be recommended for a DFC.
Well, good luck again.
Thank you, sir.
Well...
...looks like you two fellas talked out of turn a while ago.
Maybe you better go and rustle up some grub for the crew.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Java, lieutenant?
- No, I've been living on it.
You fellas must have a plantation in Brazil.
I'll leave it here.
Maybe you'll want some later on.
- Is this here Wake Island?
- Yeah.
- How far is it?
- Oh, it's about 2300 miles from Honolulu.
- And we're gonna land on that dot?
- Yeah. It's not very big, is it?
Like trying to find a buckshot in Central Park.
Gee, I wish there were some traffic signs around.
- There are, but you can't see them.
- I mean like numbers and streets.
Yeah, but I call them latitudes and longitudes.
- And they're just like signs, huh?
- Yeah, if the wind doesn't change them.
Say, lieutenant, how we doing?
Now, look, you're the fifth guy that's been down here asking that.
- We'll hit Wake all right.
- Yes, sir.
I was just asking.
- Time to relieve the kid, Minnesota.
- Okay.
You want anything, lieutenant?
Yeah, I'd like to get out of this flying boxcar.
Sure a long way to Manila.
Mary-Ann ain't no boxcar, sir.
She's a good airplane.
- Mary-Ann?
- That's what we call her.
There ain't a better airplane in the Army.
- Maybe, if you're talking about bombers.
- Any airplane, sir.
- I'll take a pursuit ship for mine, sergeant.
- Well, you can take pursuit and...
Yes, sir.
Oh, chief, that's my last apple.
I'm saving it.
Don't leave it laying around, then.
There's a pursuit pilot back there.
Morning, sir. How we doing?
You too? Every 15 minutes, somebody wakes up and comes here to find out...
...if I know where we are or if I'm gonna get this airplane lost. I'm getting sick...
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sergeant.
- I guess I'm a little on edge.
- Oh, that's all right, sir.
That's the way your old man would've told me off.
Except he'd have done it with a four-star cussing.
- Yeah, I guess he would.
- Tell me, sir, how are we doing?
We're all right. I think we're gonna hit Wake right on the nose.
Sure we will, sir.
Say, chief, what happens if the Japs have took Wake Island before we get there?
I wish you'd learn to control that imagination of yours.
- I was just asking.
- Don't you know we're not at war?
- Ain't we in the war yet?
- Hasn't been declared.
- I don't get it.
- Them Japs.
They smear Pearl Harbor, smack Manila, raid Wake, Guam and Midway...
...and still there ain't no war.
They send a couple of oily gents to Washington...
...with a olive wreath for the president...
...while the boys back home slough
Uncle Sam over the head with a crowbar.
Your Uncle Sam is a pretty tough old gentleman.
You just wait till he gets mad.
I hope you don't mind if I get slightly annoyed in the meantime.
- No. But I didn't expect it of you.
- I still don't get it.
Message coming through, sir.
And good news.
Thanks, Peterson.
Hey, you guys, take a look at this.
That's wonderful.
If the head surgeon says that, she must be okay.
- Sure she is.
- Boy, I feel a lot better.
Oh, me too.
It was mighty swell of the CO to think of sending this.
Better show it to our passenger.
Poor guy must be worrying.
- Let him worry. He's got it coming.
- You're being a little tough with Rader.
- I haven't kicked him in the face yet.
- You couldn't be jealous, could you, Bill?
Well, maybe I am.
Peterson, ask Lieutenant Rader to come up front, will you?
That's the stuff.
Now, look, stay out of arguments.
- We never...
- You can't outtalk that guy.
He's been shooting off his face against big airplanes since they gave him wings.
But he doesn't know any better.
Just quit arguing.
- You'll be a lot better off.
- Okay, captain.
- Somebody up here wanna see me?
- Yeah.
- We got some good news for you, Tex.
- Yeah?
Boy, that is good news.
She's a swell kid.
You know, Tex, we were all pretty upset last night.
If we said anything out of line...
Oh, forget it, I know how you felt.
I don't blame you.
Thanks, Tex. After all, we've known each other a long time.
We've had our arguments about these big bombers and your Peashooters, but...
Forget it, Tommy.
Just a matter of opinion.
You know, Tex, we were wondering, what was it like yesterday at Hickam?
- Oh, an awful mess. We just weren't ready.
- How good are those Japs?
They're pretty good when they got the edge, 10 or 12 to one.
They don't like an even fight.
Every time you get one alone, he lights out like a scared sage hen.
- We heard you did a swell job.
- Thanks.
Hope you get a decoration.
I'd still like to know how all their carriers got away.
We didn't even get a bomber off.
- Caught them on the ground.
- You make it sound like the bombers' fault.
Okay, you two, quit it.
You guys are awful touchy about these crates.
- Oh, it's not that...
- Hold it.
- Go ahead, Monk.
- The wind shifted again.
Give me three degrees to the left.
You'd better make it 2.44.
Okay, two-four-four.
- That's the new flight control?
- You know the old type?
- Yeah.
- Well, this is a whole lot better.
Why don't you fly her and find out what a B-17 will do?
Oh, no, not me. Looks to me like she's flying herself anyway.
Well, she is right now, yeah.
She seems to be getting us there, not very fast though.
She'll out-fly your pursuit ships up high.
- Will she?
- Yeah, she will.
- You can't sell me.
- What'll a P-40 do at 30,000?
- We'd have to tow it to get it up there.
- We'd run away and hide on you.
- Well, that's all you could do.
- Oh, sure, no arguments.
If you guys will give me a chance,
I'll prove something.
- All right, go ahead.
- Three minutes and no interruptions.
- Anything to get this settled.
- Let him talk.
Irish, the navigator gave you a course.
You reach down and turn a knob and you're on it, right?
Tommy, that gadget there is almost as good as your bombsight, isn't it?
- Well, not quite...
- Well, almost.
- And you call the sight the brain, don't you?
- Yeah.
- Then this is a sort of mechanical brain too.
- It does everything but think.
It seems to be doing the thinking right now.
- Well, I don't...
- Watch out for him.
- Did you hear about it too?
- Hear what?
- I got it pretty straight.
- What?
Why, they're gonna give commissions to these mechanical brains in bombers.
Put them in uniform and teach them to talk, turn out bomber pilots on the assembly line.
We pursuit pilots will be upstairs fighting.
We'll look down and see a flock of these freight trains coming.
Press a button: "Lieutenant."
"Yes, sir?" says that thing.
"Drop a load of potatoes on the enemy."
"I'll tell Captain Bombsight right away."
"Very well. Where's your pilot?"
"We left him on the ground.
We don't need them.
Their heads take up too much room."
- Very funny.
- Did you ever think...?
- Keep them quiet, Irish.
- Shut up, you guys. Give him a chance.
Now, seriously, guys, these big crates are all right.
I just don't wanna fight in any airplane that more than one man can ride in.
I don't wanna be responsible for eight or 10 guys.
Or depending on them, the way you're on Hauser now.
What do you mean, depending on him?
In a pursuit ship, you're a one-man army, not a taxi driver.
You're on your own.
You don't wait for orders from a guy who can't fly, a bombardier.
Hey, that's enough.
You give orders to these taxi drivers when you go to lay eggs.
"Where to?" says the Irishman.
You say, "Go a few blocks and turn right.
Give me change for a nickel, conductor."
When you get to 33rd and Broadway, throw an egg out the window and run.
Very exciting. I wouldn't fly this crate if they made me a brigadier for it.
Bill, pipe down. Shut up, Rader.
Go ahead, Peterson.
I've picked up Washington on the short wave, sir.
- The president's on.
- Thanks.
Washington's on short wave.
Get below and grab some headphones.
Yeah, and take that pursuit pilot with you.
- Do I have to?
- Take him.
- Come on, lone eagle.
- Drop him out if you get a chance.
The attack yesterday...
... on the Hawaiian Islands...
... has caused severe damage
to American naval and military forces.
I regret to tell you that
very many American lives have been lost.
But always will our whole nation...
... remember the character
of the onslaught against us.
I hope he tells us something about the Philippines.
My boy's at Clark Field.
No matter how long it may take us...
... to overcome
this premeditated invasion...
... the American people,
in their righteous might...
... will win through to absolute victory.
We will not only defend ourselves
to the uttermost...
...but will make it very certain...
... that this form of treachery
shall never again endanger us.
With confidence in our armed forces...
... with the unbounding determination
of our people...
... we will gain the inevitable triumph...
... so help us God.
I ask that the Congress declare...
... a state of war.
Pick up anything from Wake Island?
- Pilot to navigator.
- Go ahead.
- What do you think, Monk?
- I don't know, Irish.
We ought to be there now.
Go another 10 minutes, then turn east.
Okay.
- There she is, Irish, dead ahead.
- Good guessing, Monk.
- Oh, shut up, will you?
- Magellan!
Pilot to crew. Wake Island, dead ahead.
- Hey, Wake Island in sight.
- Boy, what a navigator.
- There's nothing here but Marines.
- What'd you expect to see?
- Where'd you guys come from?
- Hickam Field.
- Any more coming?
- I don't know.
- Where are you going?
- Manila.
Gangway, men. Coming in.
Good work, captain.
Major Daniels, commanding.
Quincannon. Thank you, sir.
These are Lieutenants Williams,
McMartin and Rader.
And this is Lieutenant Hauser, our navigator.
We're gonna put him in a glass case in a museum.
- Did a good job, Hauser.
- The island looked pretty good to me, sir.
- Me too.
- Yes, I guess it did at that.
- Looks better than anytime since Monday.
- You mean Sunday, don't you?
Monday here was Sunday in Honolulu.
You've crossed the date line.
He's a pursuit pilot, major.
They don't get around very much.
Could we bunk down for five or six hours, sir?
We haven't had much sleep.
In six hours, you better be five and a half hours out.
With the beacons, Japs don't have to wait till daylight to call.
- My orders are to get you out in 20 minutes.
- Twenty minutes?
That's right.
- What do you say, sergeant?
- Well, we're halfway to Manila now, sir.
Don't see any reason we can't make it the rest of the way.
- Could use some help.
- Take all the men you need, sergeant.
All right.
You first five men come with me.
Get the cowling off number 3 engine.
Quincannon, our commander,
Major Bagley, wants to talk to you.
Yes, sir.
- So they really got the Arizona?
- Yes, sir.
Hickam Field was hit just as bad as Pearl Harbor.
A lot of fifth column work.
We got practically nothing off the ground, sir.
I've studied all the wars of history, gentlemen.
I've never come across any dirty treachery like that.
How many airplanes have you got, sir?
A week ago, we didn't have any.
A few days ago, they flew in 12 fighters from one of the carriers.
Eight were destroyed after they came in from patrol.
Only four left, sir?
Only two. And one of those can't fly.
But those four Grummans took on 60 Nips this afternoon.
Shot down plenty of them too.
Hogan and Ingersol got theirs.
I think you knew them.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I did.
I suppose the Japs will be back, major.
What are you gonna do then?
We got a lad catching a few winks of sleep that will take them all on single-handed.
- Lieutenant Rose.
- Bertie Rose?
- That's him.
- You guys remember Rose, don't you?
- Sure.
- Everybody kidded him about his size.
- Little bitty squirt about that high.
- Sure, we knew him.
I'd like to stand up and salute him.
Could we talk to him before we take off?
I'll tell him you wanted to see him.
He needs rest.
We have to roust him out any minute...
...and he hasn't had much of a chance to sleep lately.
- Ship's ready, sir.
- All right, sergeant.
And good luck to you.
It's been nice seeing you boys.
Go out and blast the Japs.
Teach them that treachery can't win no matter how much of a head start it has.
You young fellows will have to do that.
We're only fighting a delaying action here.
You can't hold out, sir?
I've got 400 Marines and they're fighting mad.
There's gonna be some Jap tail feathers flying around this island or I'm crazy.
Major Bagley, can't we fly you out, sir?
You and the rest of the wounded?
No, thanks, I'm fine here.
I'm not worth my weight in gasoline.
Me or anybody else.
They need that ship of yours in Manila.
Get it there.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, by the way...
...if you see my old boss,
General MacArthur...
...tell him, no matter what the news is...
...we'll be in here pitching till they strike us out.
All right, sir, we will.
- I'll see you all somewhere.
- So long.
- Best of luck to you.
- Thanks.
- You think we ought to take him with us?
- He wouldn't leave this island...
...if you got him a lower berth in a Pullman.
- There you go.
- One for the wife, one for the kid.
He'll be old enough to read by the time I get back.
- Don't lose them, soldier.
- Don't worry.
I was gonna leave a letter here for the Clipper.
She got away yesterday.
Twenty-six bullet holes in her.
- Crew so mad they wanted to stay and fight.
- The old man got tough with them.
- Take care of this one.
- This one too.
Come on.
We don't want Tripoli to get hurt.
- Gave him the rank of top sergeant.
- No pedigree, but he sure can fight.
- He'd tackle a Jap three times his size.
- Anything.
No, I wish I could, but I'd get in an awful jam.
Give him to the Marines in Manila.
We gotta get him out of here.
- Come on, soldier.
- It's against regulations, pal.
- I can't take that dog onboard with me.
- You can.
- Wanna get me busted?
- You're not...
He's trained too. Look.
Tripoli, do you like Mr. Moto?
- See?
- Ain't that cute, Winocki?
- He's smart.
- What do you say, Brooklyn?
- Come on, soldier.
- Give him a kiss.
Gee, I'd like to, honest, but...
Gee, here goes my promotion.
- That's a good fellow.
- Duck. Here they come.
- Well, goodbye, sir. And luck.
- Same to you, boys.
- Anything we can do for you in Manila?
- You might send us more Japs.
- We'll try to.
- So long.
- Good luck, men.
- Good luck, sir.
Bye, sir.
What's the matter, Bill, can't you sleep?
No, I keep thinking of those marines back there on Wake.
- They haven't got a prayer, Irish.
- No, I know they haven't.
But they're gonna have some fun before anybody gets on that island.
Yeah.
How are things, sergeant?
Oh, I'm kind of...
What the...?
Why, it's a dog.
Who belongs to this?
Look at that. Is that your dog, chief?
It ain't my dog. What kind of a crew chief do you think I am?
- I was just asking.
- Who brought him onboard?
- Well, maybe he just walked on.
- And tied himself in a sack?
- Come on, who did it?
- I didn't.
You, Weinberg?
- Maybe the Marines done it.
- Sure.
- If I'm not mistaken, they had a dog.
- His name was Rover.
- No, his name was Tripoli.
- Talk fast.
- He had a cute trick.
- What?
Let's see if this is him. Look here, Tripoli.
What do you think of this Mr. Moto?
Moto. There you are. It's the same dog.
I know the dog came from Wake Island and I know you brought him onboard.
- Me?
- You can get busted for this.
Why don't you ask me, sergeant?
- I did it.
- You?
- Yeah, me. Shut up.
- Listen, Joe.
You ought to know better than do a trick like that.
- Why?
- Because it's against regulations.
Makes no difference. Regulations...
You know why this dog is here.
We know what chance those Marines have on that island, so they gave us this dog.
Go on up front and report me.
I've been busted out.
- Now, Joe, I did it. I don't...
- Shut up. I'm getting sore.
We got chased out before we can even light...
...got kicked all over the place by sneaking Nips...
...and you're yapping about regulations.
- You're changing your tune, ain't you?
- So, what if I am?
- I'd like to do a little chasing myself.
- Me too.
- Go on, tell them.
- I'm a half a mind to...
- I'd like to...
- Come here. Come here.
- Come here.
- Why'd you wanna do that for?
Pipe down.
Hey, look what's here.
What is this, sergeant? Noah's Ark?
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Who brought him on this airplane?
- He could have jumped on.
- Or flown in the window...
...but he didn't.
- No, sir.
- You know it's against regulations.
- Yes, sir.
And you don't know who did it?
You didn't see anybody do it?
No, sir, I didn't.
We can't very well throw him out now, can we?
- We could take care of him, sir.
- We can?
- Yes, sir.
- Who back there likes dogs, sergeant?
Why, I think Winocki and Weinberg like dogs.
- You think they'd like to take care of him?
- Yes, sir. I think they would.
- All right, sergeant, you tell them.
- Yes, sir. I'll tell them.
It'll be pretty tough on you if we gotta fly over that stuff ahead.
We can fix that.
He's a cute little pooch.
- What's his name?
- I think they call him "Tripoli."
- Tripoli?
- Yes. He don't like Japs.
Tripoli, what do you think of that guy Moto?
So you don't like Moto, huh?
Well, what is this, a flying doghouse?
Look out.
He doesn't like pursuit pilots.
- What's his name?
- Moto.
Hi, Moto.
- Didn't we tell you?
- That dog's a judge of character.
Here, Moto. Be nice, Moto.
Hello, Moto.
He doesn't like me.
I'm getting out of here.
Tripoli, you're gonna be very useful around here.
- Take good care of him, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Well, did you tell him how the pup got aboard?
- No.
- You didn't?
But I'm telling you to take care of him.
If he don't behave himself, you can take care of that too.
Pilot to crew.
We're going up to 20,000.
Better check your oxygen.
There you are, Tripoli.
He seems to like it all right.
He ain't putting up no kick.
Just like a baby on a bottle.
05564 to Clark Field.
- Here they are, sir.
- 05564 to Clark.
Clark Field to 05564.
What's your position? Go ahead.
We're about four miles northeast of the field.
Two thousand.
What are your landing instructions?
We've only got one runway.
North to south.
It's pretty rough.
The Japs just had a picnic.
Someday we're gonna find a field that's flat.
Hold him off a while.
Those tractors are still working out there.
Do not land. Keep your altitude.
Do not land.
Sorry, have to come straight in.
Running out of fuel.
Sergeant, get those tractors off that runway.
- Tell him to come in low over the fence.
- Come in low over the fence. South end.
Cut close to the wire, you haven't much room.
Tractors working down the middle of the runway.
We've got the fence with us.
- Take a look, Robby.
- Yes, sir.
- Hi there, Irish.
- Hi, major.
Say, when we were at Kelly Field, didn't I teach you how to get over a fence?
That's one way to stop quick.
I just cut her too fine.
Not bad, anyway.
After 7000 consecutive miles...
...you did a great job, all of you.
- Hi there, Rader.
- Hi you, sir.
- Don't tell me you've joined the bombers.
- No, I still belong to the opposition.
He doesn't appreciate a good airplane, major.
It ain't that.
It's just that I don't like them big.
- Tail wheel clear, sir. No damage.
- Okay.
Take her down the end and get her a full load of gas...
...drop your extra tanks and get ready for action, Irish.
- Okay, major.
- The Japs been hitting us...
...with 60 bombers at a clip.
You gotta be ready to take off at any time.
You can see yourself, you're wide open on the ground.
Colonel Blake wants to see you.
I'll pick you up in a while.
All right, sir.
Hold it.
You got any sectional maps for around here?
- Yeah, but I haven't got enough.
- Grab as many as you can get.
Find out what size bombs they'll give us and load them.
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.
- Thanks for the buggy ride, Irish.
- Okay, Tex.
- Weinberg, open the bomb bay.
- Right.
Peterson, check your radio.
You and Chester, give him a hand with the loading.
Winocki, find the line chief and see if they'll give you a transfer.
We'll get somebody to replace you.
All right, get going.
- Okay.
- Winocki.
You wanna get out of this crew?
- That's what you want me to do?
- Not necessarily.
You'd take that stuff
I've been handing you?
- We all make mistakes.
- I'm beginning to realize that myself. I...
Turn that dog over to the nearest Marine and get back and check those guns.
- Give them a good going over.
- Yes, sir.
Be ready as quick as you can, sergeant.
- Okay, Bill, let's go.
- Oh, captain.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you see if you could find out something about my boy?
Sure, I will, sergeant.
- Hey, buddy, any Marines around here?
- If so, the place would be in better shape.
- You a Marine?
- What's it to you?
- You're one all right. Got this for you.
- What's this?
You outfit on Wake gave it to us to deliver.
His name is Tripoli. Feed him good.
- He'll eat like a company commander.
- What's your name?
Callahan. Thanks.
- You all ready up there?
- All ready.
Let it go. Watch her, boys.
Steady. Keep her level.
Now turn her, fellows.
Turn her.
Hurry it up, boys. Make it snappy.
That's about it.
Take the strain off.
Take it away.
That's the situation as it stands right now.
- I've given the facts to you straight.
- Yes, sir.
We've taken a licking because we were caught on the ground.
Since then, they've outnumbered us 10-to-1.
Yet every time we've been up against them, they've lost five to our one.
In other words, if we were anywhere near equal, we could lick them.
The record proves it.
From now on, our job's to keep fighting with what we've got...
...till we get enough airplanes to blast them off the earth.
How long since you had any sleep, captain?
- We haven't had much time.
- When did you leave the mainland?
- Saturday night.
- Three days and three nights flying.
You've done a good job.
- I've got a good crew, sir.
- Yeah, I can believe it.
- Excuse me, sir.
- What'd you find, Moran?
That PT boat was right.
Looks like an invasion fleet.
- What's in it?
- There's a transport and a tanker.
- Got a battleship or cruiser and destroyers.
- Where?
Forty miles off Lingayen last time I saw them.
I didn't have much time to stick around.
Sky suddenly got full of Zeros.
So I headed for home.
I marked their position and course on this chart.
Right here. A flight of Boeing B-17s could give them a nice party, sir.
- We haven't got a flight of B-17s.
- You've got one, sir, loading up now.
- You wanna tackle it?
- Yes, sir.
All right, study this first.
Take your time, don't take any chances.
Moran will give you the dope and good luck.
Excuse me, sir. There's one thing more.
I told our crew chief I'd find out about his son, Lt. White.
Danny White. Can you tell me anything about him, sir?
Yeah, I can. He was killed the first day.
That's a shame.
Give these to old Robbie, will you?
I've known him for a long time.
How did it happen, sir?
Capt. Anderson in the other office can tell you more than I can.
He saw the whole thing happen.
Yes, sir.
Did you find out anything, sir?
How'd it happen?
He was trying to take his flight off during the first raid.
Before he could get off...
...they hit the runway right in front of him with a big one.
Didn't even get into the air.
It's not much to show for 20 years, is it, sir?
Get that airplane off the ground.
- All right, sergeant, let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Pull that dolly out.
- Close the bomb bay.
- How many loaded?
- Three, sir. All big ones.
- Thousand pounders?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
Come on, let's get this thing out of here.
Take it away.
Doors are closed. Everything all set, sir.
Wheels up.
- Wheels up.
- Monk?
- Go ahead.
- What do you make it?
Three-thirty-one, Irish.
Okay, 331.
- You better put on your chute, Robbie.
- Yes, sir.
Navigator to pilot.
- Go ahead.
- We're about 30 miles off the coast.
You better go down
and take a look.
Okay. Going down.
Fighters.
Pilot to crew.
There's a flock of Zeros ahead.
Two o'clock at about 3000 feet above us.
There's another bunch at 10 o'clock.
Take your time.
Sing out if they get on our tail
and I'll kick her around.
Make it count.
We've got a lot to get even for.
Here they come.
Coming over.
Did you see that?
They break up in little pieces.
Winocki, one at 9 o'clock even.
Coming down.
Coming over.
Great.
Kick it left.
Take it to the right.
Hey, Joe. Fried Jap going down.
Gas line on two.
Gas line on two.
- Oil line's burning.
- Yeah.
It looks like we'll have to bail out.
Pilot to crew.
Are you hurt, Irish?
Yeah.
Pilot to crew. Abandon ship.
All right, come on, kids.
Tommy, get rid of your sight. You and Monk go out through the bomb bay.
- I know...
- I'll use the escape hatch.
- But you're hurt.
- Go on.
They'll have to drag the bottom of the ocean to get this.
- Open the escape hatch. I'll throw it out.
- Right.
- Irish, you...
- Go on, get out.
You're about 15 or 20 miles northwest of the field. Get out.
Yes, sir. Go ahead, Peterson.
- Weinberg.
- I don't think I'm gonna like this.
Go on.
All right, kid.
- Winocki.
- Go ahead, I'm coming.
Okay.
05564 to Clark Field.
Emergency landing. Emergency landing.
- There she is, sir. One engine's burning.
- Get your wheels down.
I can't do it. Gear's jammed.
It won't come down.
- Well, Joe?
- I just had a look at that B-17, sir.
What about her?
I counted over a hundred bullet holes in her.
Two motors hit, props are bent, controls in a mess, wheels damaged...
...fuel tanks are punctured, one wing's gone.
At least the tip.
- I don't see how they brought her down.
- Neither do I.
I suppose if we had 10 days and plenty of spare parts...
...we might make her fly again.
I don't know that we'll have 24 hours.
- We'll have to write off the Mary Ann.
- All right, we'll destroy her.
No use lighting any fires tonight.
They'd only hit us again.
Joe, send out a demolition squad in the morning.
- All right, sir.
- So long.
- What about the crew?
- They all got back all right, sir.
- Where are they now?
- Over at the hospital.
- Quincannon asked to see them.
- How's he?
That's too bad.
Yeah.
It's good to see you.
What are you...?
What are you doing with that rifle, Tex?
Picked up too many slugs in the P-39, Irish.
I'm a foot soldier now.
They finally got him where he belongs.
Anyway, we was using up
Japs so fast...
...they was afraid there wouldn't be none left to surrender.
- Winocki?
- Yes, sir.
- They told me you brought her in.
- He did, sir.
She came in herself. I just sat there.
It was a good job.
She's all right, huh?
She's all right, isn't she?
- Robbie.
- Yes, sir?
- She's all right, she'll fly again?
- Sure she will, skipper.
What's wrong with her?
- She's gonna be all right.
- Tell me.
- Props, gear, wing tip.
- Just a tip?
It's a wing tip, sir.
Couple of days...
- Two days?
- Two days. Yes, sir.
But she will fly again?
- Yeah.
- That's fine.
Get as many men as you need, Robbie.
The colonel will give them to you.
I'll get a clearance.
We'll leave right away.
- We gotta hurry.
- Nurse.
Easy, easy, Irish.
- Get the doctor right away.
- Oh, no. No, the doctor can't go.
Regulations.
Besides, we already got one passenger.
Is he here, that pursuit pilot?
- Here, sir.
- Okay, start them, Bill.
Sure, Irish.
Everybody in, chief?
All in, sir.
- Doors closed?
- Yes, sir.
Here we go.
- Lock them.
- Locked.
Wheels up.
- Coming up.
- They sound like they're gonna run all right.
- Robbie?
- Yes, sir.
- Pilot to navigator.
- Go ahead.
Monk.
- Monk, what's our course?
- Due east, skipper.
That's right into the sunrise.
- Right into the sunrise.
- Over here, major.
That's all, boys.
Well, let's get going, fellas.
We got a lot to do.
- Corporal?
- There's something wrong.
- Yeah? What?
- I don't know.
But there's something wrong.
- What are you talking about?
- We was to burn them airplanes.
- Well, did you?
- No, not all of them, sir.
- Why not?
- They're being stolen.
- What?
- Japs are stealing it.
Don't talk nonsense, man.
There have been Japanese through but they're snipers.
- They're not stealing.
- But...
Now, wait a minute, Mallory.
Let's get this straight.
- You had five B-17s to demolish.
- Yes, sir.
- What is it you wanna tell us?
- They're missing.
- You mean parts of them?
- Sure. I mean, yes, sir.
- Why on earth would anybody...?
- Now, look.
There's a B-17, the one that came in yesterday.
- The Mary Ann.
- Have you burned it?
- No, sir.
- Why not?
We was, but I told the boys
I ought to report them Japs.
Well, you've reported.
You better burn it.
Yes, sir.
What was he talking about?
I don't know, sir, but I'd better go out and have a look.
I'll go with you.
There's the stuff we've been missing.
- How's it coming, chief?
- All right.
- All right, Weinberg, lower away.
- Okay.
- Hey, sarge, your guns loaded?
- Sure they are. Keep a coming.
- Any bombs in?
- No, not yet. Come on.
- Get down, sarge.
- Get away from here.
- Get down. We're gonna burn this junk.
- What?
A couple of you get in there and get the live ammunition out.
Hey, wait a minute.
You said you gonna burn this plane?
The colonel said to burn it so she's gonna.
Get your stuff out.
Okay, boys. Bring in the gas.
Wait a minute.
Get this gasoline away from that airplane.
- Hey, Butch.
- Weinberg.
I thought you still was on a streetcar in Jersey.
- I wished I was.
- Lieutenant Williams.
- You ain't gonna burn that airplane?
- I got orders.
- I never enlisted to be no fireman.
- Go on.
If you know this firebug, get him out of here before he gets hurt.
I don't wanna, but orders is orders.
- What orders?
- To burn the plane.
- Who gave them to you?
- The CO.
Yeah? Well, you tell that CO to take a...
Take a look at this airplane.
- I am.
- Sorry, I didn't see you.
- Apparently not.
- There's no reason to burn this airplane.
- She's gonna be good as new.
- We're gonna rig a tail gun.
- Been working all night.
- She'll fly when we get through.
- We'll have her in the air in 24 hours.
- We won't have this field.
- I know, but...
- Now, look.
I appreciate what you're trying to do.
But our job's to destroy everything that'll be of use to those Japs.
Excuse me, but we can't move any gas.
- The trucks have all been wrecked.
- Scare up drums. Get it here.
- You can't get that ready in time to...
- We can.
- The bomb sight still in this airplane?
- Yes, sir. The one we "borrowed."
- We won't let...
- Give us a chance.
- I'd like to, but...
- Excuse me, sir.
I've been in this Army 20 years.
I've never asked a favor.
- We'll get her out. I give you my word.
- We'll burn her ourselves if we can't.
You're crazy. You know what'll happen if the Japs move in?
- We do, sir.
- All the rest?
- Yes, sir.
- You'll burn her?
Yes, sir.
All right. It's your funeral.
Forget it, corporal.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Come on, boys. Let's...
- Excuse me, sir.
That observation plane is patched up and ready to go.
But I'm gonna need a gunner.
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?
I'll need one of your gunners.
Which one can you spare?
- Well...
- I can go.
- Wait a minute.
- He shouldn't go.
- He's more useful here.
- He's right, sir.
- All right. Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.
- That kid's awfully green, lieutenant.
- I know.
- Come on, give us a hand.
- Okay.
Don't like him leaving Mary Ann this way. Ain't good luck.
Be back in a couple of hours.
Swing it wide.
- Put some muscle into it.
- Will I!
Where'd you find that little beast, sergeant?
Beast?
He's a Marine Corps dog, lieutenant.
Yeah, I know. Hiya, Moto.
Hey, Moto, cut it out.
Cut it out.
Get him away, sergeant.
I've had enough trouble with Jap snipers without getting hydrophobia.
- His name ain't Moto, it's Tripoli.
- What?
Yeah, Tripoli. Maybe he don't like to be called Moto.
That's it. Cute trick, ain't it?
Yeah, very cute.
- How's it going, Rader?
- Not good. They're withdrawing to Bataan.
All I could get was a foxhole view with my face in six inches of dirt.
I thought if I came back
I could get an airplane.
You've got a fat chance for that.
We got one 0-47 left.
We might get you to Batavia or Port Darwin.
- They've got airplanes.
- We're getting out too.
- How about that B-17 I came in with?
- What? That crazy outfit?
They're working on it.
They've been up all night.
- Robbing the other wrecks for spare parts.
- Haven't got a chance getting it to fly.
- Forget it.
- But can I help them?
What kind of lunatics have we got in this Air Corps?
- Don't you know what's impossible?
- Thank you, sir.
- Hey.
- Excuse me, colonel.
- What?
- Can't I lend a hand too?
- You can go straight to...
- Help, sir? Thank you, sir.
Come on, stay with me. Come on.
- Hello, Weinberg.
- Gee, it's the pursuit pilot.
- We thought you was in the infantry.
- It's too hard on the feet.
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi, Tex.
- Things get too tough for you?
- I came to see if I could give you a hand.
How you making out with Moto there?
I'm getting along fine, Tommy, with Tripoli.
- I knew it all along, you morons.
- Sure, sure.
Looks like you guys got yourself a job.
- How about me and the Marine Corps?
- Listen to who's talking.
You asking to join this crew?
I'd rather fly than walk.
Even in this crate.
- Changed your mind, haven't you?
- No, but I'm willing to work my way.
Stop grinning and tell me what to do.
- Are you serious?
- Why, sure.
What we need is gas. I don't know how you're gonna get it, but get it.
Take the Marine with you so you can find your way back.
Okay, Callahan.
- Watch it now. Watch it.
- Pick up. Pick up the end.
All right. That's got her. Now, give me that.
Where's Weinberg?
- Left for oil. He'll be back.
- Okay.
Hey, those are Jap planes.
Get going, men.
Get on the guns.
Bring some more ammunition.
Good work, Robbie.
- Don't talk. Shoot.
- There's another one for you.
You dog!
Look, they're after the kid.
- They're gonna get him on the way down.
- Look out, kid.
Stay here, Weinberg.
Dirty...
I guess we'd better get him back now.
Yeah.
All right, now, boys, get on this lift.
Come on now.
Let's go. All together. Come on, heave.
- Well, there she is, sir.
- Think there's room in there to work a gun?
I'll show you.
Hand me the gun when I get in.
Okay.
It looks like it'll work all right.
The Japs are gonna get a surprise when they come on the tail of this B-17.
What about the tail wheel?
- I can get through if you leave it down.
- Okay.
Got a full bomb load?
To the gills. Don't know what we're gonna do with them.
Well, we can always drop them out.
- Hey, lieutenant?
- Yeah?
- Hand me a can of ammunition, will you?
- Coming up.
- Lieutenant, give us a hand here.
- Sure, let's go.
- Pull it in again. Here we go.
- How's that?
That's got her.
Now, get a couple of planks across here, will you?
- Sounds like they're getting closer.
- We'll have to be out by daylight.
- We will.
- It's almost 5 now.
Weinberg just finished Number 3.
Yeah, but if Rader doesn't get back with that gasoline soon we might as well...
- Who is it?
- Me, sir, Peterson and Callahan.
We got your gas, plenty.
- A whole truckload.
- Good.
- How we gonna get it out?
- Cans and buckets.
- Rader's bringing a bunch of soldiers.
- Here they are now.
- Where do you want it?
- Right where it is.
- Okay, men, let's get these drums out.
- Come on, snap into it.
Some of you get around behind.
Get around behind.
Good work, boys. Keep them going.
Step on it. Don't slop it.
Handle those cans careful.
Don't slop it around the plane.
Keep them level, keep them level.
Come on up here.
Okay, sarge. Number 4 will run.
- Fitter, get the cowling on.
- It's going on.
- Lieutenant, lieutenant.
- Yeah?
- Engines are ready.
- Good work. Thanks, kid.
- It's getting too close.
- Come on. Hurry it up.
- Don't spill it, don't spill it.
- Faster, men, with these buckets.
- Lieutenant Williams?
- Right here.
- They're coming. Through there.
- That'll have to be enough.
- Get everything clear to take her off.
- Yes. Hold that gas.
- Hold that gas.
- Drop those pails.
Give us a hand moving that shaft.
Come on. Get this stuff out of here.
Some get around to the front wheels.
Start her up as soon as we're turned around.
- Winocki, get on the guns.
- Come on, Peterson.
Try and hold them off.
Get in, in the bomb sight.
Monk. You and Callahan, siphon this gasoline.
If it won't start, we'll burn her.
Come on, get on this tail.
Come on now, shove her.
Straight back. Shove her.
- Hey!
- Hold it there!
That's all right.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Keep going.
Okay.
Weinberg, get inside to help Rader.
Okay, that's far enough. Turn her around.
That's enough. Hold it.
Now, take her around. Come on.
Hard, now. Push. Everybody.
Come on. Take her around.
That's enough. That's enough.
That's far enough.
All right, soldiers.
Get going, soldiers. Run.
Keep clear of the props.
All clear. Start it, lieutenant.
Okay, stay clear.
- Get everybody out.
- Lieutenant.
But we've got to. Go on.
All right, bring over that gasoline.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't burn it.
Hold it, hold it, hold it!
Get out of there. Get out.
Keep clear. Get away.
Go ahead, Tex.
Give it to her.
- Wheels up.
- Coming up.
That's all right, sir.
It's this one here, Robbie.
That's easy.
How are we doing, sir?
For a plane they said would never fly again, we're fine.
- How's our fuel consumption?
- Nothing to worry about.
We'll make Australia all right.
- Peterson picked up news on the radio.
- What's that?
There's a Jap invasion fleet headed for Australia.
That's what they think.
Our Pacific fleet's hunting for them.
I wish them luck.
You know, Tex...
...you're a funny-looking thing to be flying a B-17.
Yeah? I hope they got P-40s in Darwin.
If they haven't, I'm gonna take up knitting.
I think he's the guy that shot me in the arm just so he could get in that seat.
Don't do me an injustice, Bill.
I'd only shoot you to get out this seat.
Why don't you fellas sleep while you can?
We kind of got out of the habit.
How about it, Joe?
Is that tail gun of yours gonna work?
Just wait and see.
Hey, sergeant, we gonna stop at Mindanao?
- No, we've already passed there.
- Yeah?
You look like you know how to work that gun, Callahan.
What do you think a Marine uses, a bow and arrow?
I wouldn't put it past them.
Navigator to pilot.
Take a look down below.
On the left, right under us.
- Holy smoke.
- Boy, look at that.
Looks like we hit the jackpot.
- Here we go again.
- Start shooting.
- Those are Japs.
- What'll we do?
- Pull up through the clouds.
- Going up.
Where we going?
Give me a crack at them.
Hold your horses. Get below.
We're gonna start a war, not a fight.
Four degrees north, 124 degrees east.
Okay. Pilot to radio.
Did you hear that, Peterson?
Write it down.
Four north, 124 east. Got it?
Four north, 124 east.
Contact all air bases in this area.
Army, Navy, carriers, everyone you can reach.
Tell them we sighted a big Jap task force headed south.
- Give them that position.
- Yes, sir.
We're gonna play hide-and-seek
until they get here.
- Radio to pilot.
- Go ahead, Peterson.
Army bombers and Navy torpedo planes have reached the approximate position.
Their formation leader's calling you
on the command set.
Okay.
Williams in 05564 talking. Go ahead.
Hello, Bill. This is Jack Harper.
We're looking for you. Where are you?
Hiya, Jack. We're at 14,000.
There they are.
Where are those Japs you're worrying about, Bill?
We're roosting right over them.
Just make a turn and follow us.
Turning now.
Pilot to crew. Get ready, fellas.
This ought to be fun.
- Let's go calling, Tex.
- Yeah, man.
Now you're gonna see what an Air Force can do.
- How do you want it?
- The cruiser third from the right.
Take her in line,
I'll pour them down their funnels.
- Don't waste any eggs, Popeye.
- You watch the basket, I'll lay the eggs.
Bomb bay doors opening.
Hold it.
- Ready to bomb.
- Hold it.
Slide right.
Left a little.
To the left.
Steady.
Bombs away.
Here they come. Weinberg to pilot.
About nine Japs a little above us, around 4 o'clock.
Wait for them and make them count.
Monk, coming down, straight ahead.
- Did you get hit?
- Sure, I got hit.
- Do you need some...?
- Watch out.
- Did you see that?
- What do you want, a cigar?
They're coming in on our tail.
Wait for them. They don't know we got a stinger in our tail.
- Which one now, Tommy?
- Let's take that carrier straight ahead.
Okay.
- What do you think of our bomber now?
- Boy, I'll take it for mine.
We gotta get out of here.
We just lost half our gas.
Attention.
All right, men. At ease.
Turn that thing off, Henson.
Well, gentlemen...
...this is it.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Tonight, your target is Tokyo.
You're gonna play them the "Star
Spangled Banner" with two-ton bombs.
You've got to remember what you've learned...
...and follow your squadron leaders.
They'll get you in and they'll get you out too.
Williams, you lead the first section.
Rader, the second.
Hauser will navigate for the entire squadron...
...and McMartin will talk to you bombardiers before taking off.
Any questions?
All right, that's all.
Good luck to you and give them hell.
We shall carry the attack
against the enemy.
We shall hit him and hit him again...
... wherever and whenever
we can reach him.
For we intend to bring
this battle to him...
... on his own home grounds.
You've got me all in a sweat.
Here. Charge.
Harry, you still haven't answered my question.
Have you arranged with
Lord Rockingham to meet us tonight;
Well no.
What difference does that make;
Have you ever been so bored, you'd do something you'd regret.
Stop jumping from one thing to another.
What does it matter if we do meet Rockingham; l shan't have anything more to do with him. lf you ever invite him to this house again l shall leave it.
Dona!
So you'll leave the house, will you;
-Yes and take the children.
-Oh, you will;
-Where do you think you'll go;
-l don't know but go l will.
You're in one of your moods again.
That's it, isn't it;
What the devil have you got against Rock; l will not enjoy his familiarity any longer.
Why shouldn't he be familiar;
He's my best friend.
Why must you persist in being so blind.
Your insistence in our being seen everywhere with him is making me one of the most notorious women in London.
Fiddle de Dee Dona.
''Notorious!''
Yes. l did promise Rock again.
Not don't make a scene.
What have you been doing to Dona;
What's it all about;
Another mood, another impulse.
That's Dona.
But she's angry as sin. You better go see what's the matter.
Confound the woman that can't get along with a man's friends;
Come here. l won't let you get away!
Dona.
When are you going to stop this fencing;
There's only one way it can end.
No sense in making Harry think you're angry with me.
He's too easy going to care.
You never laugh except when you imply no woman can resist you. lt amuses me to find l am invariably right.
-lt is one time you are mistaken.
-Oh but l'm not.
You let Harry bring you to a place like this to sit cheek by jowl with these ladies, the only wife among them.
-Take your hand away.
-No.
You think more of your kisses and have less reason to than anyone.
Show in the ball.
-Harry, please take me home.
-No, l won't.
Rock won a great deal of money and l want to get it back.
Fool!
6:00 of a clear morning!
What's this;
What's going on here;
Hey! Dona!
Dona.
What is this;
Dona!
Dona!
There you are.
Rock is here, wants to apologize.
He says he lost his head.
-Where are you going;
-l'm going to Navron.
We haven't been there in years.
Damp, moldy and full of ghosts. lt is full of ghosts, ghosts of a happiness that is lost.
-l'll try to get it back.
-You've lost your wits.
Perhaps l've just recovered them. l've been planning a part for you because you insisted on it.
But l won't play it anymore. l'm done with this stupid, futile life we lead here.
And the company you choose to keep. lf you think l'm going chasing after you, you're wrong.
-How far have you come;
-From London in five days.
Where be you going;
Navron House, near Elford. l shouldn't if l were you. They say pirates come into the river there.
-Pirates;
-Cutthroats from here to here.
Come on there!
Navron, my lady.
Hello the house! l hate old houses my lady.
Tom, you sent a messenger ahead didn't you;
Yes my lady.
Call out again.
Hello the house!
Ghost and ghouls and things that go bump in the night. Deliver us.
Welcome to Navron, my lady.
-Who are you;
-William, my lady. lt smells like a tomb. l don't remember you. You were not here when we came last.
No, my lady.
There was an old man here. l can't remember his name. l heard he could barely walk.
Where is he now;. ln his grave my lady.
-And you've replaced him then;
-Yes my lady.
Your accent is foreign. l'd forgotten Cornish people speak strangely. lt is Cornish, isn't it;
A most curious accent my lady. lt's been closed much too long.
There's dust everywhere.
-You haven't noticed it;
-l had noticed it.
But as your ladyship never comes to Navron it seems scarcely worthwhile to see the rooms are clean. lt is difficult to take pride in work that is never seen.
The idleness just makes the idle servant.
Naturally my lady.
Please see that every room is swept and dusted, that all the silver is cleaned, that there are flowers...
That everything takes place as though the mistress had not been idle but had lived here. lndeed, had never gone away at all. lt will be my personal pleasure.
Did l ever really look like that;
Tobacco;
P. RONSARD'S BOOKS,
GENTLEMAN OF VENDOMOlS
Off we go.
White flowers in my room.
-Good morning William.
-Good morning my lady.
The children and l have decided to have a picnic. l felt confident you would. l asked cook to prepare a suitable basket.
Thank you William.
We shall be near the chapel.
You can bring the basket at noon.
Yes my lady.
My lady.
My lady.
Lord Godolphin.
-Madame.
-Lord Godolphin. l'm enchanted to see you.
Won't you sit down; l just heard this morning that you were at Navron. l came over to pay my respects.
Oh, your two;
-l knew Harry as a boy.
-lndeed;
My wife would have come but she's not well at the moment.
-l understand.
-We hope for an heir.
Harry is not here. l came alone with the children.
That's a great pity.
Harry might have given us some help.
You've heard of our troubles of course;
-l've heard nothing.
-Really;
Too remote here, l suppose.
We've been vexed by pirates.
At our wits end.
My neighbor's estate was sacked only a week ago.
-How distressing.
-lt's an outrage!
We complain to London and we get a few soldiers.
The squires of the county must stand together.
-ls there anything l can do;
-Nothing my dear young lady.
Except to ask Harry to come and help us fight this Frenchman.
Frenchman;
The French have made a habit of coming call ever since...
Since the Cornish pirates have gone over into France. lf you like to put it that way. l don't think you realize how serious this matter is.
We're constantly robbed. Our women sleep in terror of their lives.
-And not only their lives...
-That kind of a pirate;
What;
Well really madam. l must be getting home before dark.
-Good day madam.
-Give my duty to your wife.
Madame l will.
-William.
-My lady.
-l came here to be alone.
-Yes. l understand. lt will not occur again.
You shall make good your escape.
Escape;
You have uncanny intuition.
-Where did you get it;
-From my late master.
Much of my philosophy is borrowed from him. l think he'd term your arrival here an escape.
Why did you leave your master;
His life is such that my services would be of little use to him.
He...
-He travels my lady.
-He's a fugitive too;
People who travel are always fugitives.
Yes, my master has often made the same observation.
His life, if l may say so, is just one continual escape.
How l envy him.
The rest of us can only run away from time to time.
However much we pretend to be free, we know it's only for a while.
Yes. l think you and my master would have much in common.
Come Henrietta. lt's time for naps.
-You may go. l'll bring the children.
-Yes my lady.
Come on Jamie. Come get dressed.
Come on.
Come on my boy.
-Did you have a nice day today;
-No.
You didn't;
Yes you did. You loved it.
You don't want to go home;
Love is a friend of mine, my best friend.
Love is a friend of mine.
Love is my affection.
I spend my nights singing to Iove.
Let me go! lt seems you have been spying upon my ship.
On the contrary. lt seems our men have been trespassing on my land.
My very humble apologies. l had not realized the lady of the manor had come in person. ls it by your orders l was ceased and brought here;
My men are told to bring in anyone who ventures to the creek. ln a sack;
You're not hurt, are you;
No.
Then what are you complaining about;
Because l am not accustomed to being treated in such a manner.
Of course not.
But it will do you no harm.
Madame, please.
Well...
-What will you do with me;
-Yes... l must consult my book of rules. l have made no arrangements to deal with females.
Most remissibly.
That's better.
Oh!
-What's the matter;
-lt was you.
You left that tobacco jar in my bedroom.
Did l;
How careless of William not to have noticed.
So it was for you William stayed and sent all the servants away.
While we were in London you slept in my bedroom.
Somehow l was sure you wouldn't mind.
-Why were you so sure;
-l consulted your portrait.
''My lady'', l said very humbly
''would you grant a weary Frenchman the courtesy of your bed;''
Well;
You bowed gracefully and gave me permission.
-l did;
-Yes.
-lf l'd known for one moment...
-What would you have done; l'd have come down from the wall and behaved quite differently. l don't believe you.
Why not;
Because when l lay there looking at you that was not how you behaved.
How did l behave;
Very differently. l must be going.
My children will wonder what's happened to me.
Love is a friend of mine, my best friend.
Love is a friend of mine.
Love is my affection.
I spend my nights singing to Iove.
They know at once when we return.
They come in dozens.
Perhaps they have a fellow feeling for the ship.
My fault for naming her
La Mouette.
La Mouette;
Of course, the Seagull... l must return your call.
-Oh;
-A matter of courtesy.
Of course.
What is the correct hour;
The afternoon; And you offer me a dish of tea;
No, a pirate does not call upon a lady in the afternoon.
He comes by night rapping upon a window.
And the lady of the manor fearful for her safety, gives him supper by candlelight.
As you will.
My lady, can l be of assistance;
William, l thought l told the servants to go to bed.
They are in bed. l remained up because l thought you might want some help.
-So you know;.
-Yes my lady.
How did you know William;
When you returned this afternoon there was something about your eyes.
They were, if l may say without offense, very much alive. l said, it has happened.
They have met at last.
Why at last; l am a fatalist by nature. l've always known sooner or later this meeting would come about. l propose to behave outrageously.
-So it would seem my lady.
-Are you shocked;
-No.
-Why not;
Nothing you or my master ever did could possibly shock me.
-Do you think he will come;
-l'm quite sure of it. lt's very wrong. l'm acting against the interests of my country.
-l could be imprisoned for it.
-Yes my lady.
Do you really approve of your master's profession.
Approve and disapprove are two words not in my vocabulary.
My master only robs people who can afford to be robbed.
He gives away most of what he takes.
He is free of all ties and man made principles.
-l gather he's not married then.
-No.
Piracy and marriage do not go together.
Even if his wife should love the sea;
-She would not love it enough.
-l wish l were a man.
-Why so;
-l too would find a ship and sail out and be a law unto myself.
Gracious! Have we anything fit for him to eat;
Rest your mind my dear lady.
When l went to Helford, l took the liberty of filling a basket.
-You anticipated this;
-Yes my lady. l have premonitions. l can provide crabs prepared in the French fashion, small potatoes cooked in their skins, fresh green salad, bottle of wine, and strawberries,
-the first of the season.
-You are incorrigible.
Let me see...
Light every candle.
Bring out all the silver.
-We must to all justice to Navron.
-l will not disappoint.
You know him better than l do.
What shall l wear;
Supper is waiting. ls it wise to place all this temptation before a pirate; lt's William's fault. lt's all his doing. l don't believe you.
William never made these preparations for me before.
-Did you William;
-No sir.
He cooked a chop and served it to me on a chipped plate.
Brushed away one of the covers of the chairs and told me to be content.
Yes sir.
What brought you to Navron at last;
Perhaps l was tired of being
Lady St. Columb.
-Why;
-Why are you a pirate;
Why did you venture alone to the creek today;
Because of the uncertainty. l wasn't sure what might happen.
-That's why l'm a pirate;
-Oh yes, but...
There are no ''buts''. lt's very simple.
Piracy suits me.
My ship is my kingdom. l'm my own master. l come and go as l please.
Couldn't you do as you please in any case;
No, anyone who leads a normal life in this world of ours becomes a cog in a wheel, a unit in a system.
To me that is intolerable. l have become a rebel and an outcast.
But l have escaped from such a world.
The idea that piracy is wrong does not concern you;
Not in the least.
Even such freedom, doesn't that become a bore sometimes;
On the contrary.
Piracy has its problems which interest me profoundly. lt's an exact science.
A slipshod pirate is a dead pirate and serves him right.
A successful pirate on the other hand is much like a mathematician.
A poet of precision.
Besides l have my fun, my spice of excitement, my beating of the other fellow. lt's very satisfying.
Very absorbing.
Some day they will catch you.
Someday, perhaps...
What do you think l do when l seek refuge in your creek;
My men are not idle.
They move about the country getting information.
And the Cornish men are robbed and the women go in fear of their lives.
And more than their lives, so Lord Godolphin tells me.
Cornish women flatter themselves.
That's what l wanted to tell
Lord Godolphin.
-Why did you not;
-l hadn't the heart to shock him.
Frenchmen have a reputation for gallantry that is entirely without foundation.
We are shyer than you give us credit for.
My fellows never force their intentions on women.
The trouble is that the women won't leave them alone.
You forget country women sometimes find their husbands very dull.
They should teach their husbands better manners.
-Do you mind;
-Not at all.
Supposing in marriage, for example one partner has the understanding and the other does not.
Then the marriage is doubtless very monotonous.
What decided you upon marriage;
Harry was amusing.
And l liked his eyes.
And now you are trying to escape.
William told me you would say that.
-Then why don't you;
-Escape;
Haven't l;
-l see you get to the heart.
-lt was my intention. l caught you unawares when the mood was reflected in your face.
-lsn't it unfair;
-How so;
To make a copy of emotion at my expense.
Possibly.
But it may persuade you to discard such a mood altogether;
Disillusionment, indifference...
Yes. Willfulness.
A different person from the portrait with whom l fell in love.
-Fell in love;
-Yes.
A strange, enchanting person that looked down at me from the bedroom wall.
Lady St. Columb is not that person.
-l prefer Lady St. Columb.
-l prefer the lady in the portrait. l said to myself,
''She and no other.''
When the east wind starts blowing it continues for several days.
My ship will be weather bound and l can be idle.
There are birds to watch, fish to catch, streams to be explored.
-All these are methods of escape.
-Birds to watch, fish to catch.
Do you suggest that is the way to make me happy;
Complete happiness is a rare thing. l do not believe it can ever be fully experienced alone.
But it happens a man finds a woman who is the answer to his dreams.
And the two have understanding of each other from the lightest moment to the darkest moment.
Thank you for my supper.
Good night.
Your manor commands a view of the river, doesn't it;
An excellent view.
You haven't seen any strange craft entering the estuary; l don't wish to alarm you but a French pilot has used the river.
-He may do so again.
-You terrify me. l must warn you, he'd have little respect for you person.
-You mean he's unscrupulous;
-l fear so.
And his men are desperate and savage;
They are pirates, my lady. l shall take every possible care of my household.
Are they cannibals too; l have a little boy you know.
Calm yourself my dear.
Calm yourself.
Perhaps the Frenchman has left our coasts for good. l wish we could think so.
But he's most dangerous when he's most quiet.
We shall hear from him again.
-But it'll be the last time.
-lndeed;
Yes madam. The last time. lt'll be my great pleasure to hang him from the tallest tree. l invite all the company present to witness the ceremony.
Sir, you are very bloodthirsty.
So would you be if you'd been robbed of your possessions.
Pictures, plates, silver... all of considerable value.
But think of the joy you will have replacing them. l fear l consider the matter in a very different light.
Such a pleasure my dear
Lady Godolphin.
Where shall l change my gown; l thought my lady might not be adverse to behind that tree.
How very considerate of you.
What story did you tell them at Navron; l said you'd be staying to dine with Godolphin and would be late.
How very deceitful of you.
He is waiting for you my lady.
-Do you think me mad;
-Not entirely sane my lady.
-lt's a lovely feeling.
-So l have always understood. l shall be in the avenue shortly after 10:00.
Yes my lady.
You may drive as though we were coming from Lord Godolphin's.
Why are you smiling; l was not aware that my features had in any way relaxed.
-You are a liar.
-Yes my lady.
-You have not been long.
-l had no mirrors to detain me. l understand how simple life becomes when such as mirrors are forgotten.
May l put the worm on the hook;
Do you think l'm making progress;
Yes.
Do you really think that;
The disillusioned, willful
Dona St. Columb who roistered in the taverns and sat in gaming houses beside ladies of the town. lf there ever was such a Dona she no longer exists. l'm glad you said that.
Don't you want your fish; l was thinking of the conversation l had at Lord Godolphin's.
They are gloating over the possibility of your capture. l understand your interest, but they do not worry me. l believe them to be dangerous.
Godolphin is a dunderhead, but he's persistent.
And Eustick has a mean, obstinate look about him.
-They hope to hang you.
-Something of a complement.
Now you're laughing at me.
What do you want me to do; l want you to be cautious.
Then, tomorrow l must begin to plan again.
-You'll be going away;
-l've been idle too long. l've allowed... the creek to take hold of me.
Godolphin and his friends shall have a run for their money.
Another raid along the coast;
-Probably.
-And risk capture and death;
Perhaps. lt would be wiser to sail back to Brittany.
Far wiser.
The Seagull may be wrecked instead of lying peacefully at a haven.
The Seagull was not built to lie peacefully in a haven. lt's too bad you're not a boy.
You could have sailed with me.
Why do l have to be a boy to do that;
You're too precious too delicate for a pirate ship.
That's ridiculous. Please let me go with you just once.
-You'd be cold and miserable.
-No!
-You'd be frightened.
-No!
-You'd be seasick.
-How much would you wager;
That depends on what we have to offer each other.
My earrings. You may have my ruby earrings.
Yes.
And... what would you demand of me should you win your wager;
Let me think. l lock from Godolphin's wig.
You shall have the wig itself.
-l will take care of the children.
-l have every confidence in you. l intend to announce to that you are indisposed and feverish and for fear of infection no one is to come to your room.
And you have asked for me to wait on you myself.
Excellent William.
You are a born deceiver.
Don't you wish you were coming with me;
My interior does not take to the motion of a ship on the water.
-ln other word's you're sick.
-You have a happy turn of phrase. l have a wager with your master that l shall not succumb.
-Do you think l shall win;
-lt depends on what you mean.
That l'll not succumb to the motion of the ship. What did you think;
Forgive me, for the moment my mind had strayed.
Yes, l think you will win that wager.
That is the only wager we held William.
-Yes my lady.
-You sound doubtful.
When two people make a voyage, one of them like my master, the other like my mistress, the situation strikes me as being pregnant with possibilities.
-You are very presumptuous.
-l'm sorry my lady.
You forget l've been married 8 years and am the mother of two children.
At the end of next month l shall be 30.
On the contrary, it was these things l was most remembering.
Then l'm inexpressibly shocked.
-Open the door.
-Yes. lf Master James really wants some strawberries... l understand perfectly. l will give him some quietly myself.
-Good. Goodbye, William.
-Au revoir my lady.
Pierre.
Bon jour, madam.
This way.
Come on. QuickIy.
They're here.
-Good morning.
-The Captain wants to see you.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Let's go.
You bring luck it seems.
The wind is fair.
Weigh the anchor!
Weigh the anchor, weigh it.
Weigh the anchor, weigh it.
There we go, sea, there we go.
There we go, sea, there we go.
PIaces, everyone!
The anchor is weight, sir.
Row!
Row, row.
Up the mast!
Up the mast, up the mast.
Up the mast, up the mast.
Up the mast, up the mast.
Up the mast, up the mast.
It's okay, it's okay.
AIe, aIi, aIo, saiIor overboard.
AIe, aIi, aIo, saiIor overboard.
What do you think of my ship; l think she's bewitched and not a ship at all. l feel as though l'd never been alive before.
You do not feel seasick; l never felt so well in my life.
-Are you happy;
-Yes.
-Why do you ask;
-Because l am happy too.
Do you know what Lady St. Columb is doing right now;. l should like to know.
She's in bed with chills and fever and will allow no one in her room but William, her faithful servant. lf Lady St. Columb tosses on a bed of fever, who is this woman on board with me;
A cabin boy, the most insignificant member of the crew.
-Would you like to sail the ship;
-May l;
-Will she not sink;
-Come on.
Hold the staff in your two hands.
You keep the ship steady on the course.
Do not let her fall away or she will jibe her spritsail.
Feel the wind on the back of your head;
Keep it there then. l believe you'll do something mad, something very foolish.
You told me you wanted
Godolphin's wig, didn't you;
What are you going to do;
Do you know his brother in law, a Philip Rashleigh; l've heard Harry speak of him.
He raided the French coast and stole a ship.
He sent her to the lndies and she's returned with riches.
She lies at anchor at Fowey Haven.
My intention is to seize her.
Put a crew aboard and have them sail to the French coast.
With the cargo she'll pay for the use he's had of the ship.
Supposing her men outnumber yours.
That's one of the risks l take.
There's a fort here, at the harbor mouth.
But l can't guarantee they'll all be asleep for my benefit.
So there's only one thing to do.
Leave La Mouette here and go overland.
Rashleigh's ship is lying here.
Can you climb cliffs;
-l could in a pair of britches.
-That's what l thought.
Here's a pair belonging to Pierre.
They're his Sunday britches.
They're a little cleaner.
Here's a shirt too.
Stockings and shoes.
And a knife.
You won't want a jacket.
The night is too warm.
You better change now and come on deck when you're ready.
You know the way well;
Yes Captain. Last week l covered the whole route.
We climb the cliff at the farm of one Binyon. l know the milk maid.
They are heavy sleepers.
They will not hear us.
Here.
Come here.
You have remembered that you are Lady St. Columb.
Yes. l'm leaving part of the crew on board the Seagull. lf you wish, you know you can stay with them.
A while ago l would have... but not now.
Lady St. Columb has returned to her sick bed;
Yes!
Captain.
You will never pass for a boy with that hair. l'd cut it off if l had a pair of scissors.
You'd look more like a cabin boy perhaps.
But l'd rather risk capture than have you do it.
Put this on.
We must get our work done while the wind favors us.
Hurry now.
Like this.
Let's go. lf there's trouble make sail.
Lay a mile from the coast
-and watch for a signal fire.
-Yes sir.
Here.
Captain, here.
Come on, Madam.
Come here.
Come on, come on.
There she is.
How do we get out there;
-Get ready to swim.
-l'm not very good at it.
What's the matter;
The wind is changing. lt has backed into the south.
-Pierre.
-Yes sir;
I want you to take her back to the ship.
-Be carefuI.
-PIease no, Captain.
Do it. l've just told Pierre to take you back to the Seagull.
Why; Why must l go back;
Because the wind turned against us.
The Seagull is on a lee shore.
She0ll have to beat out of the bay.
You will have time to get back before they get sail on her.
With the change in the wind it'll be difficult to get the ship away.
Not the Seagull, that ship l mean.
That's why you want me to go back. ln case there's trouble.
Yes.
Well l'm not going back.
Why do you want to stay;
You know why l want to stay. l wanted you to go for the same reason.
Stay then and we'll make a fight for it and hand together from the same tree, you and l.
We must hurry and get underway before the wind strengthens.
But first, we must have the owner aboard.
Would you like to do something with a bit of danger;
-Yes. Tell me what to do.
-Pierre.
Go with Pierre, find a boat, cross over to town and call on Philip Rashleigh.
He lives there in the house next to the church.
Tell him he's wanted on board.
Make up any story you like.
But keep in the shadow.
You won't do as a boy in the light.
Suppose he refuses to come;
He won't refuse if you're clever.
Go now.
The wind has changed.
Warm enough though.
Pierre.
Let's have your cups lads.
Stay in the boat. lf l don't return in 16 minutes go back.
There's a squall blowing up.
-ls there;
-Coming from the southwest. lt'll be here quite shortly. l wish you had moored the ship up river.
They may have trouble with it by morning. l've never lost a ship from that mooring. l'd think it'd be wiser if you'd take off the cargo...
Who are you;
What do you want;
-lt's Mr. Rashleigh wanted.
-Who is it George; lt's someone who wants you.
Come inside boy.
No sir, just tell Mr. Rashleigh they've sent for him on the ship.
Who the devil is it, that young Jim Thomas;
Someone from the ship. ls your name Jim Thomas;
Aye sir.
The master said Mr. Rashleigh was to come aboard at once.
-The ship's in danger.
-Stay where you are!
Do you hear that;
The ship's in danger!
Let me go. l got another message to run. l got to fetch the doctor.
My mother's taken ill.
Mother; What's all this nonsense;
Jim Thomas's mother has been dead 10 years.
Well he...
Who are you;
What's wrong with the ship;
Hurry, hurry!
The wind's rising!
-Come on George!
-Come on in here.
Come on George.
-A pair.
-l win again.
-l'm off.
-Pass the rum.
Two fives;
What luck.
Come on, take hold of him.
Pierre!
Pierre!
Come on.
See a boy around this way;
No, but there's something wrong there yonder.
Looks like your ship's broken away from the buoy.
What's that;
Look, they're breaking out her sails!
Why doesn't he let go his anchor;
He'll have her aground!
Ahoy Merry Fortune!
Merry Fortune! Ahoy!
Thomas, ahoy!
Rouse the men ashore.
Blast that fool, Dan Thomas.
-What ails you Joe;
-Put on your britches blast you;
The Merry Fortune's adrift!
Ship ahoy!
They're putting sail on with not 12 men aboard!
He's mad! He'll have her aground!
She's under way!
The tide will take her on the rocks.
Come about!
Come about man!
Before you lose your chance!
Look all of you!
That's not Dan Thomas.
A thousand thanks gentIemen. lt's the Frenchman.
He's going to sea.
Man the boats! All hands!
The lines have been cut!
Swim out some of you and get those boats.
Look. There's that boy.
He cut the boats loose.
-There's two. Stop them.
-Bring your boats alongside.
Get that boy!
What's the use of a gun that's not primed!
Take it home to your mother!
Pierre!
Oh no you don't!
Hurry!
They're after her.
Fire on them.
Get down! Get down!
-Are you alright;
-Yes l am.
There's your friend Godolphin.
There's a woman aboard.
Don't fire.
A safe passage back to land.
But first...
He's taken my wig!
Give it back!
The impertinence!
You'll pay for this! l'll have you on the rack! l'll have you hanged! l'll have you arrested!
You'll pay for this! l'll have you on the rack!
Save your powder boys.
You will not catch us this time.
AIe, aIi, aIo, saiIor overboard.
AIe, aIi, aIo, saiIor overboard.
-Who is it;
-Are you awake yet;
Come in. l'm afraid l lost my earrings after all. l came once to see how you were and you threw a pillow at me.
You're lying. l never saw so.
You were too far gone to remember anything.
But we will not argue.
Are you hungry;
-Yes.
-l thought we'd have dinner together.
-What time is it;
-About 3:00 in the afternoon.
-What day would it be;
-Sunday.
Your Godolphin will have missed this morning in church, unless there's a good wig maker in Fowey.
When did you put it here;
When you were seasick.
-Can you eat a wing;
-Yes.
By now we might be hanging from a tree in Godolphin's park.
We would have been if that wind hadn't shifted.
Do you always have the devil's own luck Frenchman;
Always. l'm glad l had the adventure and the excitement but l'm glad it's over too.
You did not do too badly for a cabin boy.
How long are we going to be on the Merry Fortune;
Why;
Do you want to go; l just wondered.
What are we going to do now;.
As we will not get a breeze before nightfall we can do as we please.
We might go fishing in the cool of the evening before the sun is down.
We might.
This could be forever if we wished, tomorrow and the next day.
Lady St. Columb is not
Dona the cabin boy.
She is someone that has a life in another world.
Lady St. Columb is still asleep at Navron.
And her dreams are very, very lovely.
For all that, they are still dreams.
She will wake when the sun is up and begin to look after her house.
No, this. Always this.
Always the fire and the dark night, the supper we've cooked and you here against my heart.
Sail with me now and never return to Navron.
-Sail with you;
-Yes.
Perhaps one day you will regret it. l know what l have to offer can never compensate what you give up.
Women would wonder for a time and play at adventure, but in the end, instinct is too strong for them.
They must make their nest and l would sail alone and you hate me.
-What is the answer then;
-There never has been an answer.
But if there is one come with me and we will find it together.
-But l must plan things.
-No. No plans.
Just come back.
Come back and we'll have breakfast, then we'll take the boat down river.
And so another day, and another, and another...
No past, no future.
Only the present.
Only the present.
William. William. l will open the hall door.
-lt's locked.
-Quick.
What is it;
The children;
Sir Harry has come.
Late last night.
Lord Rockingham is with him.
Come here.
Why did they come; l gather it was
Lord Rockingham's idea. lt would be Lord Rockingham...
What have you told Sir Harry;
That you'd been in bed for several days with high fever.
You were at last getting some sleep and it would be bad for your health if Sir Harry so much as entered your room.
-He accepted the story;
-Yes my lady.
They've certainly come down to help take your master.
You must get word to him, at once. He's in deadly danger.
The ship must leave the creek at next tide. lt would be more prudent to wait until nightfall.
Your master will decide that. l'd thought to go back and have breakfast with him.
Don't worry. lt will come right.
You will be together again.
Forgive me. lt had something to do with being so happy... l know.
Poor William. You haven't slept, waiting for me.
-Thank you .
-My lady.
Thank you.
You've grown, you have.
Here you go.
Off you go moppets.
Get along.
Devilishly hot here. l'm sweating through my shirt.
You don't look so ill.
-l'm very much better.
-l'm glad to hear that. l expected you at death's door from what William told me. l cursed him good for not sending me word about it.
-What kind of servant is he;
-The best l've ever had.
Well, as long as he pleases you...
Rockingham's here Dona. l know you left London over him, but he doesn't bear any grudges.
Why did you bring him down here; lt was Rock's idea really.
One day he met a cousin a George Godolphin, who told him a French pirate was plundering the county.
So Rock said let's go down and help the Godolphin's.
How is Godolphin by the way;
-Out of temper when l saw him.
-So l should think.
His brother in law has lost a ship at sea.
-Do you know Philip Rashleigh;
-Not to speak to.
-Well l've invited him here.
-Why;
We met him in Helston yesterday in a devil of a temper.
This Frenchman sailed out of
Fowey right under his nose.
And Godolphin's too.
Why did you invite Rashleigh here;
That was Rockingham's idea as well.
He suggested we all set a trap for the Frenchman.
When we've caught him, we'll string him up for a laugh.
You think you'll succeed where others have failed;
Rock's already thought of a plan.
Hi Rock.
Here's Dona.
My Lord.
So you've had a fever.
-A messenger for Lord Godolphin.
-What;
A most becoming fever.
You don't appear delighted to see me;
Why should l; lt's some weeks since l saw you and you left in an extraordinary way. l suppose l did something to offend you. l told Harry when l left London that l wanted to be alone.
We came down on business.
We'll catch the pirate that is causing you so much trouble.
-How do you propose doing that;
-We shall see.
-l expect he's back to France.
-l'm afraid not.
Why so;
The vessel was seen only yesterday making for the English coast.
But the coast of England goes a long way.
Yes but he leaves most of it alone it seems, all but this little bit of Cornwall.
Rashleigh thinks he's even visited your river.
He must do it at night then, when l'm in bed.
Possibly he does. lt'll be amusing to stop his little game.
How really ideal for a lawbreaker.
Navron is the only big house in the district. l almost wish l were a pirate myself.
The house to be without protection, the lady as beautiful as you.
-Yes Rockingham;
-l'd be tempted to come here often.
But you're not a pirate.
Simply an unscrupulous, intrusive person l continue to detest.
What a delightful little speech.
The Cornish air has made you venomous.
Hey Rock.
A letter from Godolphin.
The hounds are gathering.
We'll have some fun with this.
Did you send an answer; l said we'd be delighted to receive the gentlemen for supper.
Whom shall l be delighted to receive;
Godolphin, Rashleigh, Eustick and half a dozen others.
After supper we'll all go down and catch the fellow.
-An amusing party, don't you think;
-No doubt. lf you wish to give them supper, l must discuss it with William.
Gentlemen.
Moppets! Tally ho!
My lady. l fear l must come down with fever again and remain in my room.
For what cause;
Because Rashleigh and the others are coming here to supper.
Rashleigh may recognize me as the woman on the pirate ship.
Why are they coming here tonight;
They've agreed on a plan to take your master.
Thank heaven they'll be too late the Seagull will have sailed.
-No, she will not have sailed.
-What do you mean; l went to the creek this morning.
She grounded on a rock causing a leak below the water line.
She will not be ready to sail until after midnight.
You must go and warn your master.
At once. Quickly.
You will be advised to stay in your room while they are here.
No, l shall receive them.
-l must keep them until midnight.
-But...
Yes my lady. l will arrange everything.
Sir Harry will choose the wine.
-Get away quickly.
-Yes.
Halt!
Who goes;
-Grace, have you seen William;
-No, my lady.
He went out after 3:00 and no one's seen him since.
Where's that fellow William;
He's got the keys to the cellar.
He will be back directly l expect. l had to break the lock. l tell you, l'll sack the fellow.
Rock is right. He's got an impudent, familiar manner.
-Did you win at piquet;
-Do l ever win playing with Rock;
Hurry Dona. That's the company.
You'll be late.
William.
-What's happened;
-lt is nothing.
Come on. Quickly. lf you find that William, send him to me.
-You will spoil your gown.
-How did it happen; ln the woods one of the Lord's men challenged me. l managed to evade him but received this scratch.
Did you get word to your master;
Yes. He said to tell you he is in no way disturbed.
Will the ship sail by the night;
Dona!
What the devil is keeping you; l dislike having my door flung open in such a manner.
But the guests are waiting.
You know l'm no good in company without you.
Go along.
What's the matter with this thing.
-Fix this.
-l will. Now get along. l take it the plan l suggested has been carried out.
The men are on the beaches and boats made ready. lf there is a vessel hiding up the river, we'll be on hand to get her as she comes down on top of the tide.
-Lady St. Columb, gentlemen.
-Gentlemen.
Lord Godolphin.
Madame.
Lord Rockingham.
Philip Rashleigh.
-Mr. Rashleigh.
-All of whom friends of mine.
Welcome to you gentlemen.
This is the first time in many years company has been in this house.
Won't you sit down;
Lord Godolphin, how is Lady Godolphin;
-Take this.
-Very well. lf your wife should not approve let me offer my own physician.
Very good idea.
An excellent idea. l swear l've seen you somewhere before my lady.
But l can't for the life of me remember time or place.
What an impression l must have made on you at the time!
On the contrary madam. lt's an infection in your voice and l've heard it not so long age.
Dona has that effect on every man.
They always feel after seeing her that they've known her before.
You'll find it keeps you awake at night.
Were you ever in Fowey where l live; lt is very difficult to get in and out of Fowey l'm told.
-You heard how l was robbed;
-Yes. So distressing.
You never had news of your ship since;
No. However tonight to settle accounts with him once and for all.
Rashleigh reminds us that we linger overlong at the table. l'm exceedingly sorry. l would not dream of hindering you in any way.
A toast to the success of your undertaking gentlemen.
To success.
AII together...
AII together at the Cornish fair.
Big bass drum, boom, boom, boom.
Gentlemen, it's half an hour before midnight. ls the leader the desperate fellow you've led me to believe;
Worse, the most bloodthirsty rogue l ever cast my eyes on.
We've heard since his ship carried a complement of women most kidnapped from our own villages.
He had a woman aboard the Merry Fortune.
A bold faced baggage if ever there was one. l could see her on the deck as plain as l see you now.
There was a boy who came knocking...
-That's it!
-What;
That boy's voice.
That's it.
-Are you quite well Mr. Rashleigh;
-Madame l swear l don't know. l keep hearing that boy's voice.
Slight effect of memory.
We're all subject to it at times.
A provocative discussion my dear Dona.
But l must remind you we're here tonight on desperate business.
You say these men cannot conduct affairs without your insistence;
Nonsense Rock!
You let my wife conduct her own table.
-My beautiful.
-Quite right, Harry.
Sit down, Rock.
-Go on fair lady.
-Thank you gentlemen.
As l was saying, it is very easy to take one person as another.
As in the playhouse for instance.
A player becomes another person before one's very eyes.
She's gonna do Nell Gwyn.
She does Gwyn to the life.
Come on Dona. Give us Nelly.
A scoundreI maid who was fair of fyce.
Dona!
Stop this nonsense!
Fie on you. l wager you can't remember the next line.
-A thousand pounds he does.
-Go on fair lady.
...was rysed from a sIum to a king's embryce.
-The Iife of NeIIy.
-The Iife of NeIIy.
The Iife of NeIIy has truIy flown from ceIIar to the throne.
From highway mudIing to great renown.
From earthIy scum to a monarch's crown.
Who the deuce is that;
Someone's late for supper.
Let's have some more wine.
We're all here. We expect no one else.
How about you Godolphin;
We're meeting in secret.
Someone open the door.
Where are the servants;
Are you all asleep;
Hello Dickon!
Someone's blown out the candles. lt's black as pitch in there.
Dickon!
What orders did you give the servants Harry;
Did you tell them to go to bed;
Bed; No.
They're waiting in the kitchen.
Give them another call Rock.
There's no answer.
There's no sign of a light.
Dickon!
Dickon! Dickon!
Someone open the door one of you, will you;
Who asks for Navron House;
Jean Benoit Aubery.
-What are you...;
-Hey!
Pray be seated gentlemen.
Would your lordship like to join the gentlemen;
-Where have you been!
-Sir Harry, your servants are tied up in the game pantry. l will not keep you long.
As for her ladyship, she may go if she pleases.
But first l must have the rubies she wears on her ears. l've made a wager about them with my cabin boy. ls that all; lf the Lady St. Columb would spare me that as well... l would have no more excuse for piracy.
Thank you. l trust you have recovered from your fever; l thought so your presence here will doubtless bring it back.
That would be a pity.
My conscious would be uneasy.
My cabin boy suffers from fever from time to time.
But the sea air does wonders.
You ought to try it.
Lord Godolphin.
The last time we met l relieved you of your wig.
That was also the fault of a wager.
This time l regret to say l must have your weapon.
Your sword Lord Rockingham.
Thank you William.
Good evening sir.
You'll be happy to know the ship has been returned to her owners.
Your sword if you please.
What you have in your pockets if you please.
-You'll pay for this you scoundrel.
-Possibly. ln the meantime it is you who are paying. Thank you.
Pardon.
Sir Thomas.
Come, come, Sir Thomas.
People with too much money are invariably unhappy.
They have no time to enjoy themselves. lf you touch a penny l'll hang you.
Hang for a penny, hang for a pound.
Now that. lf you please...
Do not wait to be urged, disgorge.
May l ask you sir, what induced a French gentleman to turn into a pirate;
-Mr...;
-Killigrew.
Mr. Killigrew, there's a certain beauty in the world, something just beyond our fingers which we all desire but few achieve.
Where you look for yours, l do not know.
But mine l have found at last as a pirate.
You cruel scoundrel.
Of all the confounded cheek.
And now gentlemen, l wish to return to my ship.
But l do not want you to close upon my heels.
Please allow my men will escort you upstairs and lock you in.
No. You've made game enough of us. l'm sorry gentlemen, but l must insist.
Lady St. Columb, would you be good enough to go into the salon;
Sir Harry.
That is a fine emerald.
Not a single flaw, which is rare in an emerald.
However l owe you something for your hospitality.
-Good luck Frenchman.
-Thank you Mr. Killigrew.
Good bye gentIemen.
Her ladyship and l will now discuss the affairs of the day.
You were so reckless.
Don't you know the woods and hills are plagued with men;
-Yes.
-Why are you here then;
Because l had not kissed you for nearly 24 hours.
The gentlemen are attended to.
Our men have left for the meet.
Very well. l want you to go to the cottage of your friend.
Await the lady's orders until all danger has passed. l understand.
What are you going to do;
This morning when William told me you were alone no longer l realized that our make believe was over, that the creek was our haven no more.
My ship must sail.
And although she is free, l will remain captive. l am bound to you as you are bound to me.
All that you feel, l feel.
Every thought, every wish, every changing mood. lt's too late.
There's nothing we can do. l told you that last night when we were together.
And the morning was many hours away.
At those times a man can shrug his shoulders about the future, because he holds the present in his arms. l have loved you. l have loved you in almost every moment.
But most of all when you threw yourself on the Merry Fortune in Pierre's britches, with blood in your face l looked at you and laughed and a bullet whistled over your head.
What is the answer; lt is still the same.
You are Dona St. Columb, wife of an English baronet.
Mother of two children. l am a rebel and an outlaw. lf there is an answer, you must make it.
Not l.
Should you choose to remain here with your husband and children, nothing has happened in our adventure together that would make your life with them a pretense.
But if you choose otherwise, we shall be off Coverack by sunrise. l will wait for you there. l see your jewels have been returned to you.
What did you give for them;
You are very serious. l should have thought this jest would have amused you.
You're right. lt has amused me.
When l found l was able to squirm loose and get out the window. l was prodigiously amused.
-You might have freed the others.
-l have.
They slipped out quietly through my window on the heels of the pirate jesters.
That too l find amusing.
Why didn't you join them then;
Because one thing does not amuse me.
That Dona St. Columb should look at the leader of the jesters as she did. ln a way that could mean one thing only.
That she loves him.
And so;
And so; l understand much that has puzzled me since l came here yesterday.
That servant of yours.
Those walks in the woods.
That illusive look in your eye l'd never seen before.
Yes indeed, illusive to me.
To Harry.
To all men but one man.
And l've seen that man tonight.
Well, do you deny it;
To you l deny nothing.
You could be imprisoned or hanged if the truth comes out.
Not a very pleasant ending for Dona St. Columb.
You've never been inside a jail, have you;
You've never smelled the heat and the filth.
You've never tasted the black bread or thick water.
The feeling of a rope about your neck as it tightens and chokes you.
How would you like that;
All because you imagine l smiled at a pirate when he asked for my jewels.
You lie.
You smiled at a pirate but not when he asked for you jewels.
Very well, tell Godolphin, tell Rashleigh, tell Harry even.
They will say that you are mad.
Possibly with your Frenchman on the seas and you at Navron House.
But suppose we catch him and bring him back here and play with him a little as we used to 100 years ago.
With you looking on Dona. l think you'd give yourself away. lt amuses you to be dramatic but the days of the rack are over.
But pirates are hanged, drawn, and quartered with their accomplices.
Then if you believe me an accomplice.
Do as you like.
When you've caught your pirate you can hang us side by side.
You'd suffer that and be glad.
Because you've had at last the love you've wanted all your life.
-lsn't that true;
-Yes. lt is true. l could kill you for it. lf you hadn't left London and come down here...
-lt could have been me.
-No, Rockingham. Never!
Don't cry Jamie.
Don't cry. lt's alright Jamie. lt's alright my darling. lt's alright.
QuickIy, Iet's go to La Mouette.
They won't see us here.
Where's the Captain;
Lets go.
On guard!
Over here.
On guard, sir.
Touche, my friend.
Come on, quickIy.
Sir Harry.
You won't beat me.
-My Captain.
-Go to the ship and weigh anchor.
No, Captain.
Go to the ship!
Get behind him! Put him down. l shall regret having to kill you,
Sir Harry.
Gentlemen, one at a time, but not all against one.
-Fight you as a gentlemen;
-Run him through!
No! Take him alive.
My Lord.
We shall hang you slowly from a very tall tree and l shall enjoy every moment of it.
Hang me;
Perhaps.
Rock.
Rock.
Dona. lt's Rock. l found him down there.
He's dead.
That Frenchman killed him.
What happened; You were with him in the salon, weren't you;
He gave me back my jewels and he went.
He must have come back and he killed Rock.
He'll pay for it.
We got him you know.
We got the blasted fellow.
-What are you saying;
-The Frenchmen.
The ship is gone and the crew but we've got him.
-ls he wounded;
-No.
He'll hang without a scratch and know what it feels like.
Where have they got him;
Godolphin has him in his keep.
We hang him tomorrow at daybreak.
Tomorrow;. lf they don't burn him alive when find out about Rock.
-l killed Rockingham.
-Dona.
-l killed him. l had to.
-Dona...
-You're jesting;
-l warned you to keep him away.
When he found he couldn't have me he hated and wanted to kill me.
He came after me up the stairs l took the arm from the wall and...
Rock...
Dona, l've been a fool.
-Forgive me.
-lt's too late.
Dona, don't leave me. l beg you. lt's my fault.
Dona, don't leave me. l'll do anything to make you happy.
Dona.
There's the children. l'm no use to them without you.
They need you.
Dona...
Jailer l promised the lady a view of the prisoner.
Yes my lord.
This way my lord.
My dear you've got some steps to climb.
Can't think why they didn't build the jail on the ground floor. l can't see why it amuses you to see the prisoner.
Gives me something to do.
Doctor says my son won't be born before midnight. l think l'd better go in first.
Stand up when l choose to visit you.
Do you hear what l say;
Stand up.
Lady St. Columb wishes to take one of your drawings to London as a souvenir for His Majesty.
Lady St. Columb is very welcome.
What is your favorite bird madam;
That's something l never can decide.
Here's a seagull but you haven't given him his full plumage.
The drawing is unfinished madam.
This particular seagull lost a feather in flight. lf you know the species, you will remember they seldom venture far to sea.
This gulf for instance, it is probably only ten miles from the coast at the present time.
Then you think he'll return in search of the feather;
Unquestionably madam. l never heard of a seagull or any bird picking up feathers.
-Did you make your choice;
-A woman can never make up her mind.
That's a very nice bird. l rather like the heron but l suppose you prefer the stork.
That reminds me. They'll be wondering where l got.
-Well l must...
-No, l must be getting back.
Jailer, open the door.
Come in and remain with her ladyship.
Excuse me madam, l must be getting back to Dr. Williams.
Certainly. Remind Dr. Williams he has a heavy responsibility. l will madam. l certainly will.
Pirate... Just a scribbler.
Step away.
His lordship is very worried but there's really no need.
Dr. Williams is a most capable physician.
So they say my lady.
-Then he's well known here;
-His fees are well known.
Men like me couldn't afford to meet him in the streets. l doubt l'd know him if l did.
He's a Helston man and to my knowledge l've never set eyes on him.
You are a married man l suppose.
-Twice my lady.
-What is your name;
Zachariah Smith sir.
-And you have children;
-Naturally my lady. 13.
And another one on the way.
We don't want to be unlucky.
Zachariah Smith, you are a very remarkable man.
How is your wife doing;
-Not as well as l could wish.
-Then she must have Dr. Williams.
But l'm a poor man...
But l know Dr. Williams and l've never found him unreasonable.
He's a fat, jolly man rather foreign not at all medical.
One might mistake him for a gentlemen's body servant.
Supposing l ask him to come over and see you later;
When he's made a father of Lord Godolphin.
That would be about midnight.
-What do you think Zachariah;
-Generally sir.
Then l'll send him over tonight.
And you can come to terms. lf l were you l wouldn't mention a fee at all.
Just let things take their own course. l will. l'm obliged to you l'm sure.
Not at all.
Now l've chosen my drawing and l'll go down with you.
Very well my lady.
Midnight then.
Dr. Williams and his groom.
Good bye Frenchman.
Au revoir, Lady St. Columb.
The heir must be about to come.
Even the guards are gone.
You're Dr. Williams and l'm your groom.
Yes my lady.
Better drop the ''my lady'' and call me Tom.
No. My lips would not find the words. lt would be too distressing.
-Are you ready;
-Yes.
-Who is there;
-Dr. Williams of Helston.
Come inside sir.
-Was it a boy tonight;
-Oh yes it was indeed.
Robert James, his lordship had a boy.
-Sit down Doctor.
-Thank you.
What was the weight of the boy;
The weight... let me think.
3 or 4 pounds.
Call that a boy. lt's no bigger than a shrimp.
Did l say 3 or 4; lt was a mistake of course. l should have said 13 or 14.
No, it was 16 or 16.
That's something over odds sir.
That lady here today had great confidence in you. l'm glad to see it is not misplaced.
That lady; She is worth
20 Lady Godolphins.
Between you and me and the twelve apostles, that Frenchman is finer than some who intend to hang him.
Really; l am most interested to meet the man. l've heard by all reports a very desperate person.
The country will be well rid of him.
He's sleeping now l suppose. lf a man can sleep on his last night...
Lord bless you no sir.
He's up there smiling and smoking and drawing birds. lt's irregular sir, but if you really want to see him...
Then l will be pleased to prescribe for your wife without fee.
-You understand;
-Thank you Doctor.
You're not the man we took you for. lndeed l am not as you will discover.
-ls Dr. Williams here;
-What do you want with him;
Word from the House.
The lady's been taken worse. l'll call him.
Zachariah! They want the Doctor up at the house!
What are you doing;
Doctor what...;
-Dona, where are you;
-Here.
Open the door.
Zachariah! lt's the Doctor going home.
-This is perfect.
-What are you going to do;
Halt!
Be caIm.
Who are you;
What do you want;
Did you give his Lordship an heir and is he pleased;
Pleased me foot. Twin girls. l want my supper!
Get in William.
Dr. Williams, meet Dr. Williams.
La Mouette keeps her rendezvous.
They're coming in for us. lf the breeze is steady William will see Brittany tonight.
And home.
There's a house there in Finisterre. lt means, ''the Land's End''. lt's on a piece of rock that runs into the Atlantic towards America.
Your house and mine, my Dona.
How can l tell you;
-Your children;
-Yes.
That night you'd gone my son
James awoke and cried. l knew then that... a man may be free if at all costs if he will, but a woman can only escape for a night and a day.
Then the answer is still the same. l love you. l shall always love you.
Dona, you belong to me.
-Why can't we have our happiness;
-l shall be happy in you until l die.
Your boy may follow the sea one day. lf he does, tell him of La Mouette.
And a pirate who escaped.
A pirate who loved the sea more than anything in the world until he found you.

Good morning, my little honey bees.
Good morning!
Good morning. Good morning.
Good morning, one and all.
Good... Morning!
Good morning!
Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
Where's Pavel Grigorich?
I've come to be your guest for breakfast.
Stop shouting.
Don't be so young with the voice.
You'll have to come back, Comrade Karp.
Grandpa is still asleep.
A new baby came to the hospital last night, and then Grandpa came home and did his writing.
Good morning.
That's not the way you say it.
You say, "a baby came into the bright world in the darkest part of the night."
Don't talk so pretty.
A new baby. Isn't that nice?
What's nice about it?
I -- I'll be back.
You argue too much.
Heep!
Good morning, Grandpa.
Ah. Good morning, my lad.
You should not have worked all night.
Mm. I had a good night's work.
Did a little writing.
Feel better? Mm-hmm.
Come and have breakfast now.
Oh, dear.
What seems to be the trouble, Boris Stepanich?
It'll take a better mechanic than I am to answer that.
The patient is cured, Father.
It's all right now.
Hello, Comrade Karp.
You ever been to Kiev?
Of course.
There was a pretty girl there who lost her head over me.
Years ago. Oh, of course.
Well, it is the last day of school.
Tomorrow morning, we'll be on our way.
It's our vacation, and we're going to Kiev on a holiday.
That's a nice bus ride.
Not for us. We're hiking.
All the way? Well, of course.
It'll only take us four or five days.
Only?
Marina is going?
Yes. Marina and
Clavdia and grisha.
My brother -- unfortunately.
Ah, but Marina is the one who counts.
Have you proposed?
Or does one propose in these modern times?
Good morning, Papa.
Good morning.
What are you doing, Marina?
I'm baking honey cakes for the trip.
The cakes have to be baked now?
You're not leaving until tomorrow.
Well, it's hard at our age to remember how exciting a trip can be.
The planning is half the fun.
A long time ago, this is the way I wore my hair.
Were you pretty, Mama, when you were young?
I'm not so old, little one.
Mama's pretty now.
And she's not old.
It's only that you're so young.
I'm not so young.
There are plenty who are younger.
Yes. And there always will be.
Sophia, when you go marketing, remind everybody to come and help with the loading of the trains.
Tell them there will be supper for all when the work is finished.
I'll tell everybody!
I'll tell everybody!
May I, Papa? May I?
I'll do it on my way to school.
Please, may I? May I, please?
All right. You tell them.
I'll say there will be supper for everybody.
Yes.
I'll say there will be music and singing.
I'll say there will be dancing, and I'll say there will be cider for old people and fruit drinks for children.
You might also remember to say there will be work.
Oh.
Yes. I'll say that, too.
"Everybody must work," I'll say.
No pancakes?
You know what else the comrade commander said to me?
You have my permission not to tell me.
"Eat pancakes."
That's what he said.
It has been recently discovered that pancakes are fine for a bombardier's nerves.
That ought to interest you, Damian.
You're going to be a doctor.
It doesn't interest me.
Don't worry with those maps, Damian.
I know all the roads.
And when we get to Kiev,
I will show you and your little friends all there is to see.
Me and my little friends are still young.
A visit to Kiev is something that doesn't happen to us every day.
And don't patronize us about it.
Be a man of the world in front of your mirror.
It's better that way.
Mirrors don't talk back.
Hmm!
Most men in the world feel pleased when they have sons.
I wonder why.
I told you years ago.
Two quiet little girls would have been very nice.
Well, you can't change us now, and you wouldn't if you could.
Two healthy, brilliant, handsome sons.
June 20, 1941, 8:00 A.M., broadcasting from moscow.
Be still, both of you.
German troop movements are reported on the Polish border.
Their nature is unknown.
Reports reach us of a typhus epidemic in the German-occupied city of Warsaw.
London was bombed twice last night by the Luftwaffe.
In the Polish city of Lodz,
112 Polish children died this morning as a result of being made to give blood transfusions to German wounded.
Children. Taking blood from...
Here's a report from a reliable source in -- goodbye, now.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Papa. Bye, baby.
Goodbye, Papa.
Bye, Mama. Bye, dear.
Come on, Clavdia!
You'll be late!
You're my brother, not my guardian.
Mind your business.
Good morning, Clavdia.
Good morning, Marina.
You're early.
Oh! You know I never eat breakfast.
You always look so clean.
You're no cleaner than I am.
Maybe not as clean.
And hair is curly.
Your hair looks nice.
Oh, it's as straight as wheat.
And don't try to console me.
Well, well.
The last day of school is a happy day.
Even I remember.
Oh, no. No?
We're very sorry it's the last day.
My first words will be to congratulate our three pupils in the last class who have all been awarded scholarships to the state
University of Kiev.
One of those three has taken the highest marks of any pupil in this year's senior graduating class.
He is Damian Taratsa.
It is not my custom to start your vacation with a lecture.
But this is the summer of 1941, a solemn time.
No one of us knows what will happen.
I don't have to remind you that we are people with a noble history.
You are expected to carry on that history with complete devotion and self-sacrifice.
I think you'll do that.
And now... Have a happy summer.

You know, Marina...
I-I can't explain it, but, well, I-I almost wish we weren't having this supper tonight.
Oh, goodness knows
I usually love it.
But -- but it interferes, really, with the trip, if you know what I mean.
Too many good things at once.
Mm. I felt it, too.
I didn't want anything to happen.
Just the trip. Nothing else.
Oh, well. We really won't celebrate tonight.
We'll just eat supper and act like it was any other evening and we were home with the family.
You know what? I'm not going to sing tonight.
Even if everyone asks me, I won't sing.
And don't you sing either.

We'll have three whole days in Kiev.
We shall see everything.
It's been a good year.
Scholarship to the university, of course, means the most.
There was a medal for marksmanship.
And now this vacation.
We'll be separated for a year.
You'll be getting a scholarship the following year.
But it's this year
I'm thinking about.
That's a long time.
I don't think it is at our age.
You don't think so?
How strange.
What are you saying, Marina?
Nothing. I don't want to talk about it.
It's odd you don't think a year away from me is a long time.
It doesn't worry you?
No.
All right.
You don't have to keep saying it over and over.
Are you sure you feel about me as you used to?
I don't like this talk.
It -- it's bad.
It's only natural that I -- it's not natural at all.
It's not like you.
I've loved you since I was old enough to see you.
I will love you until I die.
That's the way it is, and there's no need to talk about it.
You mean you'll never talk about it?
You'll never tell me?
I'll tell you in my own time.
But I'll not tell you to waste time.
Look here, Marina.
You and I are -- are like one person.
And I always thought you wanted both of us to be educated and --
I didn't mean that.
Of course I want you to go to the university.
Of course.
It'd make me sad if you didn't -- and ashamed.
But it wouldn't matter.
I'd go anyway.
I'm a citizen of this country.
I intend to go forward with it and -- and to give it all I have.
I have strong feelings about it.
You'll come along with those feelings.
But... You don't come before them.
I understand.
I feel the same way for myself, for both of us.
I was being foolish.
I only wanted to be with you.
I'm proud you got the scholarship, of course.
You'll be a great man, and the whole district will be proud of you.
You'll have medals.
I think we'll go to the theater every night.
That's too often.
And we'll grow old together, and I'll be a beautiful old woman and very kind.
Oh, I'm sure of it.
My grandchildren will love me, and you will, too, more than ever.
What's wrong with that?
Plenty of people grow old together and have a fine life behind them.
I didn't say there was anything wrong with it.
I shall buy baby dresses in Kiev.
For whom?
For our first...
Our grandchildren.
Oh.
You'll, um, you'll put the dresses away for a while?
Yes. Of course that's what I mean.
When we get home, you and
I should call a meeting, and the five of us should go over all the plans for our journey tomorrow.
Don't you think, Kolya?
I don't need to plan to get up and get dressed and eat my breakfast.
I know how to do that.
I'm getting tired of hearing you children talk about this trip.
I'm only going because
Father made me.
Oh.
Oh, I thought it was because
-- well, because me.
I-I mean us.
Don't you like us?
No.
Oh.
What's the matter with you, Clavdia?
I-I have a choking sensation in my chest.
You eat too much.
You usually do.
It's not at all that.
It's my emotions in the chest.
Clavdia, you're a throwback.
What's that? What do you mean?
Somebody who doesn't belong to their own time.
Ours is a new world, Clavdia.
You don't belong in it.
Oh, I see.
You mean I'm rather old-fashioned and romantic, rather.
Yeah.
No.
I've told you -- you cannot come along.
I'm always too young.
I'm too young for everything.
Well, someday, when everybody else is too old for everything, you'll be just old enough.
Take care of the puppy.
I'll bring everybody a present.
Don't get your feet wet.
And take care of yourselves.
Goodbye.
Goodbye!
Papa.
Goodbye.
The first time we have ever been separated, Grandpa.
It's only for a short time.
Good morning.
Clumsy in the body are those clumsy in the head.
You wake Grandpa and I'll -- oh, I'm gonna kill you, you nasty little thing.
I'm gonna kill you.
Drink your milk, Clavdia.
You will now find it more comfortable to get up.
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Seven times last night you said goodbye.
We'll be back soon.
We'll try to get along without you.
Well, goodbye!
Oh, Mother.
We'll be back soon.
Oh, have a good time, son.
We'll miss you.
Damian?
Damian!
Coming!
Good journey, Marina.
Good journey.
Good journey! Good journey!
Good journey!
Good journey to us all!
Kolya!
Good morning, Kolya.
- Good morning!
- Hello.
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
Hey!
Good morning, Clavdia.
What's the matter with you?
With your face?
You look so foolish.
Well, you never said "good morning" to me before.
Good morning!
Good morning, Kolya.
Good morning!
I don't like guns, Kolya.
Then don't have one.
I don't like the noise they make.
Who does? Why are you carrying it?
If you look at me, Clavdia, you will see that I'm in uniform.
Men in uniform carry guns.
Uniforms, air force,
Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.
Remember now?
Oh, you're teasing me.
Well, don't play with that gun, please.
I intend to use it.
When we near the end of the trip,
I intend to kill someone and leave their carcass for the hawks.
You want to help?
Oh, no. No. I will stop you.
I-I will sacrifice myself.
Oh, I couldn't stand to think of you lying in jail, a murderer, tortured with conscience.
Oh, Kolya.
I've got to kill him. But who?
Damian.

Don't your feet hurt?
In the army, your feet learn to stop hurting.
I told you young athletes not to walk so far and so fast the first day.
Make a fire.
We must have a fire.
A fire is so romantic.
Oh, we must have a fire.
Otherwise, we can't sit around and dream.
Maybe it would be better to kill you.
Do, um, do all men make noises when they sleep?
I don't know. I never listen to all men.
Hey, it's Karp.
Oh! Karp!
Good morning, Karp!
Good morning!
Good morning. Good morning.
I thought we'd pass you.
We're on our way home.
I'll give you a ride to the crossroads.
Good! It's time for a ride.
You can't go on a walking trip and take a ride. You can't.
Well, you see more if you walk, but we'd only be riding a few miles.
Oh, come on.
And riding's good for the feet.
Well, well. Nothing like having good feet.
My feet are not good.
They're much too small.
Everybody knows that.
I think we should walk.
You can't go on a walking trip and take a ride.
Who made up that law?
It's not a law. It's just -- well, it's -- it's not romantic.
I see.
You and Marina walk.
We men will ride.
Would you ride while I walked?
Darling Marina, I'm not making you walk.
But would you let me walk while you rode?
The brightest of women are not bright.
I'm learning that.
We are women.
Different things go on in our heads.
That's what makes us attractive.
You coming?
If you're quite certain you want me.
A fine marriage yours will be.
Boss you and then laugh at you.
Oh, come on, Clavdia.
When you don't stand by your convictions, you set back the cause of all women everywhere in the world.
She's an interesting type, Clavdia.
Like a piece in a museum.

Sometimes I hear things from other years.
Sometimes I even forget what year it is. or 1941.

We can all hear it.
They're planes.
And you ought to know what planes sound like.
They're many planes, and they're not far from here.
Can't we have an air force while you're on leave?
You should have let Grandpa examine your head.

Get down immediately!

Understand that! Quickly!
Get out of your wagons and get into the ditch immediately!
Leave the horses.
Get in the ditch!
I don't believe you. We can't leave the horses.

You take a drink of water, child.
Both of you... Close your eyes and take my arm.

We are not young anymore.
Any better?
No.
Clavdia?
No.
I guess it's the first time in my life I haven't been hungry.
Oh, yesterday we were home, and everybody in the -- one day you're home, and the next day...
The next day, here you are.
Last week, the little boy was in the store with his mother.
I met them there.
He had a ball, and he was bouncing it with his left hand.
I remember because I noticed he was left-handed and wondered what it felt like to be left-handed.
And now there he is without his left hand.
Without the hand that bounced the ball!
Oh! I shouldn't be talking this way!
I know it!
You're all ashamed of me.
You are what you are, Clavdia.
It is my opinion that the trouble in the world comes from people who don't know what they are, who pretend to be something they're not.
Come on, Clavdia.
I'll wash your face.
Dirty cheeks.
Go back.
It's over. There is nothing to do.
Good morning, Nadya.
Well, how do you feel?
I always wanted to know how the doctor felt.
I'm very glad to have a patient.
People around here are too healthy.
You like your baby?
Oh, she's very ugly, like her father.
And beautiful.
Olga!
Commander Petrov of the
12th Border Cavalry speaking to the border villages.
The fascist armies of the German Reich invaded the Soviet
Union this morning.
I will repeat.
German armies crossed the border of the Soviet Union this morning.
The attack was made with unprecedented fury.
But our land will be defended with a fury the fascist armies have never known.
To the border villages, salute, comrades.
The war has come.
Comrades, we have good reason to know that our country is at war.
In our small village alone,
30 people have been injured.
Eleven people have been killed.
But this is not a time for mourning.
It is time for revenge.
We will divide into two groups, each to do his duty from this day until death.
The able-bodied men are to come forward to the right of this building.
We will move from the village to the hills and take our position as guerrillas.
I will go immediately to Comrade Commander
Petrov's Garrison to get the guns.
The second group has the hardest job.
They must stay behind.
As guerrillas, we must have aid and information.
As villagers, you must, before the entrance of the Germans, destroy everything.
Everything, comrades.
The houses you have built, the crops you have sowed with your hands, the cattle you have raised.
The Germans are not more than 50 miles away.
Yours is the dangerous job.
For this job, you will volunteer.
It is you who may have to live with the...
...the Germans.
"I, who am about to become a guerrilla fighter of the Soviet Union, I take this solemn oath."
I, who am about to become a guerrilla fighter of the Soviet Union, I take this solemn oath.
"I will not lay down these arms until the last fascist is driven from our land."
I will not lay down these arms until the last fascist is driven from our land.
"I am willing to give my life, to die in battle to keep my people from fascist slavery."
I am willing to give my life, to die in battle to keep my people from fascist slavery.
You know where we'll be.
One of us will come every night to the pine grove.
Remember, we'll need supplies and information.
This is our land, our village!
We remember we fought another war to make them ours.
We swear to give our lives if they be needed.
We swear!

I'm ready, Comrade Petrov.
Good. Now, just a moment.
These reports show the
Germans rapidly advancing across our territory.
By nightfall, there won't be a highway free of their guns, their tanks, and their supply trucks, all going to the front.
Remember, you have a good 40 miles to travel.
Your best chance is to take to the back road.
That'll take too long.
I'll have to take a chance on the highway.
We need that ammunition bad and quick.
I'll get the truck through.
You can count on it.
Good.
Comrade Karp is going to take my place.
My duty is to report to the nearest airfield.
So gather around, listen closely, and I'll show you what I think is your only chance to get back to the village.
The Germans must have crossed the river at the upper bend, and -- get down, everybody!
Father!
Kolya.
Damian.
Get the guns out.
Save the guns.
Get them out.
Get these boxes out!
Did you do it?
Yes, Father.
They're safe.
For our men.
Take it to them.
They're... They're at the end of the stream.
Other side,
Obmyk Hill...
Beyond the pinewoods, past...
Take it back to them.
You hear me?
Yes, Father. We'll take it back.
Say hello to... To your mother for me.
I promise.
Well, that's all of it.
I'll say goodbye now.
Travel at night and stick to the woods.
When you get to the upper crossroads, you'll see a little -- but what about you?
You said the Germans had crossed the river.
How can you get to the airfield?
I'll get through all right.
Now, do your best.
Don't be frightened.
Fear is a bad enemy -- or so people have told me.
Bye, Clavdia.
Goodbye, Kolya.
Marina.
We'll do the best we can.
That's all.
Tell Mother that...
Grisha.
Goodbye, Kolya.
Look after them, Karp.
Twenty-five years ago, we fought and died for this earth.
People go forward.
They fight for themselves and make things better for themselves -- more food, a good bed, jokes to make and time to laugh.
Then the filthy come and try to stop it.
They want to take away from people all the good they've made for themselves.
Well... Then you take your gun and you fight until you've killed all such.
Ready, comrades?
Yes, comrade.
We're ready.
We are ordered to occupy the North Star village.
How big is this village?
Not big.
We're only taking
125 men to hold it.
We are ordered to establish a regimental field hospital in the village
North Star ahead.
Field hospital and a village dispensary.
How can I take care of all these men and more to come?
The order says that more ambulances and doctors will be sent to us.
I don't want doctors.
I need surgeons.
The colonel has forgotten me.
I am a surgeon.
A surgeon is a man who can operate, Dr. Richter.
I have not forgotten you.
Dr. Richter, where did you take your medical training?
Freiburg, as I have told the colonel many times before.
That was a good school.
I must beg the colonel's pardon.
With respect to the colonel's superior rank and reputation,
I must beg the colonel's pardon to -- do not beg my pardon so often, Dr. Richter.
Good manners do not make a good surgeon.
It's well known, of course, the colonel studied at the
University of Leipzig.
In the great days.
I was a pupil of freidenthal.
His most famous pupil.
Freidenthal? The Jew?
Yes. Freidenthal the Jew.
The colonel did not mind his being a Jew?
Mind?
I never thought about it in those days.
It must be pleasant to be so sure of oneself.
I should like to think I was as good as the colonel thinks he is.
The day you think you're as good as I am, Dr. Richter,
I will know that you're suffering from delusions of grandeur and I shall commit you to an asylum.
Trust me, Dr. Richter.
Burn your houses! The
Germans are coming!
Burn your houses! The
Germans are coming!
It's hard. The hardest part.
The hardest part.
Go and do it now.
Others give their lives. We give what is life to us.
Look.
Another burning village.
Speed up. Speed up.
Quite different, isn't it, Dr. Richter?
The Army of the Third Reich didn't see burning villages on its pleasant tour through Western Europe.
This amuses the colonel?
No. Danger doesn't amuse me.
I only state facts.
A strong people. One has always heard that.
A hard people to conquer.
Silence!
Who is responsible for the burning and destruction in this village?
Where are the younger men?
They burned it and have tried to escape.
Is that correct?
Has the hospital been burned down?
It is not bad. We caught it.
Carry in the casualties immediately and get the operative cases ready.
As you order, colonel.
The chairman of the Soviet of this collective farm is called... Rodion Pavlov.
Is he here?
Where is his family?
I wish these questions answered!
You have already, by the burning of this village, shown yourselves to be enemies of the German army.
We punish our enemies...
Severely.
Where is the wife of Rodion Pavlov?
I am the wife of
Rodion Pavlov.
Come forward.
I wish to know where your husband is hiding, how many men he has with him and how much ammunition.
Yes?
I cannot answer those questions.
You are certain that you will not answer?
I am certain.
Take her inside.
Swine. Swine!
I am a doctor.
They will bring her out.
Her right arm and her right leg will be broken.
You should advise your people to give information when it is asked for.
You are a doctor and you are able to -- in this new order of ours, we have to countenance and commit many acts one does not necessarily approve of.
Shh.
We'll have a look.
We'll join you at the crossroads.
Wait.
Take Clavdia and grisha and hitch the horses.
I can shoot. Do what I tell you.
If anything goes wrong, then -- well, drive away.
Don't wait. Just drive.
The horses. Quick.
Hitch the horses.
Frightened?
I...
Yes.
Good.
Only fools aren't frightened when there's something to be frightened about.
And I don't like to see a fool hold a gun.
Now, go on.
And remember -- you'll only have a second to fire and you must be quick and sure.
Try to sleep.
I'll watch.
Planes?
It's hard to tell.
You get some sleep, my dear.
Everything sounds like planes to me.
I think of Damian and the children...
Wherever they are.
And Kolya.
You are quiet for you.
I haven't had any sleep for 30 hours.
I've been on four bombing trips today.
You're my fifth.
How did you do?
Well, I always do well.
I got two planes...
Whole line of supplies.
Got some big guns near the river.
Well, get ready to do it again.
We'll be over them in three minutes.
We'll see how good you are.
Oh, I'm good.
You must have heard about me.
First flight, son?
This is my first flight in the war, Grandaddy.
I was at home on leave.
Well, don't get shaky about it.
I'll bring you through all right.
He talks that way.
I've been flying with him for years.
I'm used to it.
I can blow those supply trucks.
What do you say?
Save your bombs.
This will make a good strafing job.
We're going down.
Tanks. Tanks in those trees ahead.
Pilot, are you all right?
Are you all right?!
Gunner, they got the pilot.
Come forward at once.
Sir.
Where did you get it?
Are you bad?
I don't know.
I can't feel it.
Remember -- years ago in training?
They said when you couldn't feel it, it was bad!
That's not true. That's all talk. You hold on.
We'll go over the road and let go what we got left, and I'll have on the ground in 10 minutes.
We're badly clipped in the back.
It's worse than I thought.
You crawl to the back.
I'll let you know when to bail out.
No, never. Never been frightened, I mean.
Maybe there's something the matter with me.
All right. Crawl back now.
If you can't open the hatch, I'll do it for you.
If the plane's too bad to land,
I'm gonna try something else.
And it doesn't need more than one man to do it.
Now, don't argue and sound brave and be a nuisance.
I can do it alone.
Get ready to jump!
Well, you'd never have made it anyway.
I'll get ready for it.
This is going to be for my father and for me and for my village and for people I've never seen.
Those are big words.
I guess I'll have to stand by them now.
I'm coming down, and it's going to hurt you!
And I'm coming down just where I want to because I was a good bombardier and a good pilot, too!
The children were given their supper at the hospital tonight.
Good. They needed it.
It was a good supper
I saw it
Why did they do that?
There's been nothing but bad bread.
What? What, Anna?
The children are still at the hospital -- in the hall, on the benches where I saw them.
Supper was over long ago.
Shh. Shh.
What?
Sasha.
Shh.
He says we are to stay here.
He says we --
Mischa and Sonya went in there and...
Forceps.
Gauze.
No. Don't do that.
No. Don't do that.
Rag.
Orderly!
Guard! Guard!
Guard!
Take this man out. Put him under arrest.
Do not be so nervous,
Captain Richter.
You are well guarded in this room from the feeble attacks of an old man.
Dismissed!
After you, Dr. Kurin.
I realize that this is difficult for you to understand.
But our plasma supply was insufficient, so we have to take blood for our wounded where we can get it and where the donor is easiest to control.
I was looking at your hospital library today.
I had forgotten that Kurin the pathologist was Russian.
Strange to find you in this little village.
You came to the University of
Leipzig to read your paper.
Must have been...
30 years ago.
I was a student, of course, and not allowed to hear you.
But I remember it.
Cigarette?
They said that men of medicine see all that can happen to people.
I'm an old man, and
I have seen much.
But how can a doctor bring himself to not only take blood from children but to bleed them white?
Comrade Kurin.
This boy needs help.
May I? Of course.
Dr. Von Harden, do you mean that you're not having this man arrested?
If you wish to be a warrior, Captain Richter, you must take chances with your life.
Dr. Kurin is a famous man of science.
He's not a man who kills and therefore no danger to us.
Halt! Who goes there?
It's me -- Dr. Kurin.
Advance to be recognized!
The Kechins' boy.
You recognize him, comrade.
Take me to Rodion.
Yeah.
Twenty trucks. Now start counting.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Ten seconds. And here they come.
Twenty trucks, then 10 seconds.
Eight motorcycles in 15 seconds.
And more trucks without ammo.
Yes. That's the track.
Karp hasn't seen these hills for 10 years, but he remembered them as if -- we'll go straight through without stopping, and we'll be there.
We'll have done our work.
Yes.
Your face has changed.
And yours.
Tired and hungry.
You read about hunger, but you don't understand how bad it is until it happens to you.
If Karp and I can keep awake, nothing else will matter.
I can do some of the driving.
Not this time.
We'll be climbing.
It'll be hard.
You'll sleep on my shoulder.
That'll make me feel good, sure of myself.
Could I, Marina?
I've never...
Could I?
I'm going through the woods to this side.
As their group of motorcycles come around this turn,
I'm going to fire at them.
That'll stop the column.
You will be ready here.
As the firing starts, you will take the wagons across the road.
The firing will cover the noise, and they'll not be watching for you.
They'll be busy with me.
I hope.
If two people were there to fire, one one side and one another, it'll be a better chance for you.
I'm coming with you.
It's not for us to talk of what's best for one of us.
You're needed to take home the guns.
That's what you must do and what you will do.
When you hear the firing, go across.
When it's over, I'll meet you on the hill by the cow path.
On the hill by the cow path.
He's right, Marina.
It's the only way.
Soon now.
When you hear the firing, go across as fast as you can.
And remember to leave room for me to cross next to you.
Grisha.
Where's Clavdia?
She's gone.
She went after Damian.
I saw her.
Grisha.
Why didn't you -- I must go find her.
You must not go after her.
You must let her alone.
I saw her face.
Oh, Grandpa.
Anna.
Oh, somebody help me.
Make me do something right, the way everybody else does.
Keep me from being so frightened.
Keep me from crying, please.
Where are you hit?
Bad?
There are only two -- don't go, Marina. Wait a few more minutes.
A dead kid and a fat girl.
All right. Signal to them to go on.
The dangerous enemy has been dealt with.
I'm going.
Stay here.
Blind.
Clavdia?
Come on. We just have time.
Is it bad?
No wounds on him.
Clavdia.
It's me -- Marina.
And Karp.
Clavdia.
Cla-- where is she?
Clavdia.
She's dead.
Clavdia.
Marina?
Yes?
Where are we?
Over the Yunageno Hills.
How much longer?
Not much more.
What time is it?
About 5:00.
In the morning or -- or in the afternoon?
All right! All right!
You say Boris has not come with the guns, but they are your children, and they're being bled to death!
Why, the whole village will be -- our time has come to fight.
It does no good for me to lie.
Men with rocks and clubs are not good against machine guns.
Now, there will be five men to a gun.
You know it, and I'll say it.
This may be the last time we ride down a hill.
What do you say?
All right. Saddle your horses.
Take up your watch at the pine grove.
And when Boris gets here with the guns, rush him down to the north cornfield.
Pray that he arrives in time.
All right. The selected men, dismount.
The rest of you wait here until you see the gas aflame, and then ride to the schoolyard and ride fast.
Barricade it soon as you get in.
You know the plan.
Each group knows what to do.
Now let's do it.
All right. Now for the gasoline.
Let's keep it pouring.
Down! We are fighting in the village!
I'll take you!
They're our men!
They've come to fight.
Sophia, Nadya, our children are home!
The children!
Nadya!
Grisha.
Anna!
My baby is home!
Damian, it's your mother.
Damian!
Mama.
Mama.
Grandpa!
Gran--
I have come for another visit, Dr. Von Harden.
I'll only be a minute, doctor.
Sulfanilamide.
Come in, Dr. Kurin.
You do not like Dr. Richter.
I do not like incompetent doctors.
I do not like much of what I have done for the past nine years.
You do not like bleeding children to their death?
The boy died?
You knew he would die!
They took too much blood.
I am sorry for that.
Yes, I believe you when you tell me you're sorry.
I'm sorry for many things, Dr. Kurin.
Most sorry that it isn't the world we used to know.
I have heard about men like you -- civilized men who are sorry.
This?
This kind is nothing.
They will go when their bosses go.
But men like you, who have contempt for men like him -- to me, you are the real filth.
Men who do the work of fascists while they pretend to themselves that they are better than the beasts for whom they work.
Men who do murder while they laugh at those who order them to do it.
It is men like you who have sold their people to men like him.
You see, Dr. Von Harden, you were wrong about many things.
I am a man who kills.
You, uh, feel you'll need this thing, huh?
I like it.
We will come home someday.
I want to sew again.
And you will want to write your book again.
We are not so old.
They tell me you were very brave, Grandpa.
And why not, child?
I'm of the same blood as you and Clavdia.
It's gone.
There will be another someday.
Yes.
It will be different for us.
Wars don't leave people as they were.
All people will learn this and come to see that wars do not have to be.
We'll make this the last war.
We'll make a free world for all men.
The Earth belongs to us, the people, if we fight for it.
And we will fight for it!
♪ Our forest, our river ♪
♪ We'll fight for land and home ♪
♪ Our land we'll deliver back to its own ♪
♪ A dream we cherish ♪
♪ And never perish ♪
♪ And we'll be free men once more ♪
Please fasten your seatbelts.
We're landing in three minutes.
Well, there is your Singapore.
The crossroads of the world.
The star of the orient.
Will you please fasten your seatbelts.
The romance and adventure of far-flung places.
That's a lot of press agent's ..
What's the word they use over here for a lot of talk?
Walla walla.
That's it. Thank you, Mr Gordon.
A lot of press agent's Walla walla.
I love that word.

I can't wait to ride in one.
You will have the opportunity.
Tomorrow we visit the Palace of

Bellows, we pick you up at 8 sharp.
- In the morning?        - Yes, sir.
The cool of the day.
Excuse me.
Mr Gordon?
That's right.
- Can you please step this way.
"Netherlands East Indies Flight 1."
"For Batavia and Surabaya."
"Ready at Gate 1."
Mr Gordon must have influential friends.
Can he get us out of this line?
- No. I'm sorry.
Well.
A reception committee.
I thought these old eyes were failing me seeing your name on the passenger list.
I can't quite say "welcome" Gordon.
You know, I hoped you would have forgotten my existence, Mr Hewitt.
How could I?
I was always sorry the war interrupted our relationship.
It promised to be delightful.
That's the trouble with history.
It does not leave any time for sentiments.
You don't mind if I sit down?
- No, of course not.
How is the pearl business?
Same little misunderstandings.
My cargoes are nothing but copra.
The pearls were just, one might call it, a super-cargo, eh?
Pipe dreams, Mr Hewitt?
No, but ..
It doe smell its way about.
Why did you come back?
Leave something behind?
Well, I wanted to see Singapore again.
Find out what had happened to it.
I always loved it.
A one-sided love?
Passport?

No.
Well, anyway.

Well, before the war, it was only eight.
But I guess everything has gone up, huh.
Anything else?
- No.
Have a good visit.
Thanks.
"Flight Number 10 now loading."
Oh.
If you should happen to want me for anything, I'm staying at the same hotel.
Have a pleasant visit.
Mr Gordon.
Cadum.
It's good to see you again.
- It's good to see you, Cadum.
You had a rocky time?
I was in a concentration camp but that's passed.
A suite?
- You haven't forgotten have you.
I'd like my old one if I can have it.
Oh yes. 202.
I am sorry. That was already reserved for Mr and Mrs Bellows.
Well, I'm afraid I haven't another suite but I can put you next door. At 200.
Let's go.
That will be fine, Cadum. Thanks.
Boy, will you take my things up to the room.
Leave the key at the desk.
"It was five long years since I'd been here."
"But nothing was changed."
"From every corner memories came back to me."
"Things I hoped I'd forgotten."
"It almost seemed that I'd returned to
Singapore just to see this bar again."
Table near the window, sir?
No, thanks. This one will do.
You wish something, sir?
Yeah.
Two gin slings.
Two?
Yes, sir.
"This had been our table.
Linda's and mine."
"She called it 'the hideout' as it was by itself and just big enough for two."
"It felt strange to be sitting here alone now."
"Linda Grahame."
"We'd known each other only a short time. Then the war came."
[ Ship's horn! ]
My boat. I must go now.
- They give three warnings.
I always loved that sound.
Today I hate it.
I hate it too.
Oh, why can't I stay with you?
Darling, we've been through that.
There's a war on. It's the last ship.
We may never see each other again.
Don't forget me.
- How could I?
There's so many things to remember.
All crowded into this one short week.
Unforgettable things.
Your hands.
And the way you hold me.
And your eyes.
The way I have to stand on my toes to kiss you.
I'll remember you. Just as you are.
All of you.
Please, let's say goodbye here.
No. I want to be with you as long as I can.
Watch you go up the gangplank.
Watch the ship sail.
Watching. Until there is nothing.
[ Ship's horn! ]
Waiter.
"All passengers please be sure to have your tickets to board the ship."
Your baggage is in cabin, Missy.
And many flowers. All from Tuan Gordon.
I wish I could take you with me, Ming Ling.
Missy is so kind.
Perhaps I'll come back after the war and visit you.
Here. Take this just to remind you of me.
Goodbye, Ming Ling.
- Goodbye, Missy.
Goodbye, Matt.
Come soon. As soon as you can.
- I will, darling.
Goodbye.
[ Ship's horn! ]
"The moment she had gone I felt alone."
"More alone than I'd ever been in my life."
"And I wanted her back."
"I wanted her desperately."
This way, madam.
Give me the desk, please.
Cadum? This is Matt Gordon.
I'd like a room for a lady.
Yes. Miss Linda Grahame.
But only for a day or so and then we'll be moving in together.
I know, Cadum. It's alright now.
No, it's alright. We're ..
We're getting married.
Yes.
Thanks, Cadum.
He says he hopes we'll be happy.
He should know how happy.
Is that the way you propose?
Yep.
I accept.
Hold it.
Light out, remember.
Doesn't it seem strange seeing her out there?
All alone.
- Yeah.
Regrets?
- Uhuh.
There is someone on board I miss terribly.
Who?
The steward who has my baggage.
All my alluring clothes.
- I'm glad they've gone.
They knew you longer than I did.
And much more intimately.
Tomorrow you can buy anything you want.
Oh, are you a rich man?
- I'm a pirate.
There is a treasure buried in that room.
Under the floor?
- That's too easy.
It's in the ceiling.
If nobody else finds it we'll have a fortune.
Oh, that's bad.
Why?
I've a friend at home.
A girlfriend, darling.
She is two weeks older than I am and consequently much more experienced.
She once told me that if I ever met man that tells me he loves me.
That I should make him spend all his money. Ruin him.
Just to make sure he means it.
So let me ruin you fast.
How will I be ruined?
- You're my last victim, darling.
[ Singing: ]
"Onward Christian soldiers."
"Marching as to war."
There was a little chapel like this behind our house.
I used to go there after my mother and father died.
It was high upon a hill and I could see for miles.
I used to search the horizon and ..
Wonder what was ahead for me.
The roads below were like white, winding threads.
People and cars seemed like black dots.
Each one separate and alone.
Just as I was.
But not anymore.
"With the cross of Jesus."
"Going on before."
There now, that's all for today, children.
Run along, put on your vestments.
It will time soon, for services.
I'm sorry to bother you on a Sunday sir, but we'd ..
Did you wish to make arrangements for a wedding?
How could you tell?
- That wasn't difficult to guess.
Emily, you had better help the children.
These young people seem to be in a hurry.
Will you come and sit down.
Now.
Your names, date and place of birth.
Matthew Gordon.
April 26 1910.
Brooklyn.
Linda Grahame.
September 11 1919.
Rochester, New York.
I was once in Brooklyn.
Why didn't I see you?
I was probably in Rochester trying to find you.
Linda Gra ..
- Grahame.
G-r-a-h-a-m.
G-r-a-h-a-m-e.
There is an E on the end.
- There is?
Yes, darling.
- What do you know.
You've both been baptised, I suppose?
Have you ever been married before?
No, sir.
- No. Same.
You two haven't known each other very long, have you?
It's our ninth day.
Oh, I see.
Now will you please sign.
Here.
And here.
You understand you are just signing the notice of intention to marry?
You have to wait three weeks for the banns to be posted.
Three weeks?
Well.
It will give you time to get better acquainted.
Thomas.
Thomas!
They just said over the radio that an important announcement is coming.
Everyone should stand by.
[ Radio: ]
"Attention! Attention!"
"News has just been released .."
"That Penang has been bombed by two flights of Japanese aircraft."
"Japanese ground forces have invaded the northern part of the peninsula."
"All military personnel .."
"And local defence corps are requested to report to stations at once."
"This announcement will be repeated every five minutes."
"We knew it was coming."
Thomas, what are we going to do?
When it comes, make the best of it.
Under the circumstances sir, would it be possible for us to be married sooner?
Please, couldn't you forget the regulations? Just for once?
I feel so far as the church is concerned it might be arranged.
Be here a week from
Friday. In the evening.
And don't forget the ring and two witnesses.
God bless you.
- Thank you.
[ Singing: ]
"Silent night."
"Holy night."
"All is calm."
"All is bright."
"Round yon virgin, mother and child."
"Holy infant, so tender and mild."
"Even under the threat of a Japanese attack we celebrated Christmas."
"The following evening we were going to be married."
Shall we get our presents and open them under the tree?
Would you rather?
- No. Too many people.
I think so too. We'll have our own.
Well darling, where ..?
Has nobody ever told you, Sascha?
You wear too much perfume.
- Please.
Don't tear my shirt.
The material is irreplaceable.
The balcony has an amazing view.
You will be able to watch the Japs when they attack.
I'll try not to be here.
They may be here sooner than you think.
They are not so very far away.
What a pity.
The government can't turn those large naval guns to shoot inland.
That would make such a remarkable noise.
Sascha here is an expert on everything.
Especially other people's belongings.
Don't say that.
I just came here to tell you that ..
Mr Mauribus still expects your visit.
I haven't got time but give him my regards, will you.
He'll be very disappointed.
I must apologise for having interrupted such a charming ..
Tête-à-tête.
Sascha.
Haven't you forgotten something?
Did I?
Oh yes.
Merry Christmas.
It might burn that irreplaceable shirt.
You are very thoughtful.
Mr Gordon.
Goodnight.
A charming fellow.
Merry Christmas, darling.
- Matt, what did he mean?
Who is Mr Mauribus?
- Oh ..
Santa Claus.
Alright. Keep your secrets.
Here. You open your present first.
Do you know what it is?
- Yes, it's Burmese.
A Myanmar talisman.
One life?
Thanks, darling.
Hey come on. Now open yours.
Do you like them?
They must have cost a fortune.
- No, I got them for nothing.
One day I was hungry so I ordered some oysters.
A hundred oysters. I was pretty hungry.
When I opened them, what did I find?
In each one there was a little pearl.
Wasn't that lucky?
You fished for each one of these from your schooner.
You're learning, darling.
You used to say "boat".
May I? I am experienced in opening locks.
Beautiful. Perfectly matched.
You know we always think of you
Gordon in connection with pearls.
And then Miss Grahame ..
Who has spent every moment with you since her arrival in Singapore.
Appears with this remarkable necklace.
It's, how shall I say it?
An arresting coincidence.
Very arresting.
Are you trying to imply that he stole it?
Not exactly. The correct term would be "smuggled".
For your information, I bought that necklace in America. In New York.
May I ask where?
- You May. Brett & Langworts.
It has a clasp of Malayan manufacture.
Brett & Langworts import jewellery from all over the world.
Undoubtedly .. you'll forgive me if I check with them by cable?
No, I won't.
But don't let that stop you.
I admire your frankness, Miss Grahame.
Thank you.
Now may I have my necklace back?
It's yours. For the moment.
It will be a pity to lock it in a vault.
It looked beautiful on you last night.
Yes, I know. It is very becoming.
May we go now?
Of course. Sorry to have inconvenienced you.
But we have to clean things up, with the
Japanese nearly knocking on our gates.
Besides ..
I've had an affectionate interest in
Mr Gordon for too long to give up now.
You will find that my interest in Mr
Gordon is just as affectionate as yours.
Merry Christmas.
You were perfect.
- Matt.
Yes, I smuggled them.
Now that it's mine, can I do what I want with it?
Sure.
And I'll give it to Hewitt, so he won't bother us anymore.
That won't stop him.
What else can he want?
A little bag of loose pearls worth a quarter of a million dollars.
Where are they hidden? In you room?
That's what Hewitt would like to know.
Can't you sell them without smuggling them?
For a fourth as much.
Does that make it worth the danger?
- Maybe that's what I like about it.
Have you planned to do that all your life?
Well, plans change.
Kind of a plan to get married.
But I'll be married in half an hour.
Will he arrest us?
- No. Anyway, not you.
You see, you don't know where they are.
Well, where is my best man?
Come on! The military just occupied your hotel.
"I told Linda to wait for me."
"I knew I shouldn't have left the pearls."
"I'd run so much risk to get them and .."
"To keep them."
"I had to get back to my hotel."
I'll hurry, darling.
"When I reached the hotel enemy planes were already over the city."
"But I didn't turn back."
"The pearls had become an obsession. I had to have them."
Sorry, sir.
[ Radio: ]
"The second Japanese force is landing at Ubin Island."
"Defence lines are being formed at Seletar Aerodrome."
"Calling local defence force."
Zeros.
One .. two ..
"They were still there."
"Near .. but there was nothing I could do."
Your room, old chap?
- Yes, but ..
It's alright, I'll come back later and get my things.
It will probably be much later.
If there is anything left of it.
Ming Ling.
Where is she?
Where is she?
"When I came to we searched for hours everywhere."
"Until there was no hope left."
"When we finally went back to my schooner, I .."
"I knew Linda was dead."
Are you Mr Gordon?
Yes.
Would you take my wife and children with you?
If you haven't room for me, it doesn't matter.
Yes, I'll take them.
Get aboard, all of you.
"I never meant to see Singapore again, but now five years later, I'm back."
"But not for memories."
"A quarter of a million dollars' worth of pearls would bring anyone back."
I hate to disturb your reverie.
It is nice to have you back in Singapore again.
Oh Mr Gordon, isn't this a lovely hotel.
The view from our balcony is simply enchanting.
But those sawed-down dink-pots they call bathtubs have bumps on the bottom.
I'd like to join you.
Mrs Bellows wants to see the town.
I just can't wait to meet the orient.
Come along, Gerald.
Tourists.
The Japs were here four years and didn't kill you off, huh?
Oh, they were very pleased with me.
I knew where all the hidden wealth was.
And told them
- Oh no.
I just gave them a few second-grade trinkets from time to time.
To keep them happy.
Won't you join me?
- No thanks.
Before I forget.
Mr Mauribus wants to see you.
Oh, is he still around too?
- Oh yes.
He has something that belongs to you.
What?
How should I know?
Good afternoon.
- Hello.
One moment, please.
It's alright. Mauribus is expecting me.
Ah, Mr Gordon.
Come in. Come in my friend.
Sit here by my desk.
This is indeed an honour.
Your boy Sergeant tells me you're holding something for me.
What is it?
- Don't be so impatient.
Have you an American cigarette?
Thank you.
Well, I see you haven't forgotten.
You are looking very well.
How was your war?
Very absorbing.
How was yours?
- Oh, not too bad.
I like troubled times.
They keep the police occupied.
Looks like they're back in business.
But I'm not.
I'm just a tourist now, Mauribus.
I came back to Singapore for sentimental reasons.
No, Gordon.
You came back to get a quarter million dollars worth of pearls you left behind.
You have quite an imagination.
No. Just a logical mind.
You were at sea in 1941 for five months from August to December.
Your harvest must have been good.
But strangely, you took no pearls with you when you left here.
You figured that all out, huh?
You were kind enough to evacuate a group of refugees.
Among them was an acquaintance of mine.
He found nothing.
There was no fishing during the war.
Pearls are very scarce.
I am willing to buy yours, at a price.
But I do mean to have them.
There aren't any.
I brought back nothing but copra.
Copra?
Here is a sample of your "copra".
You remember this necklace?
Where did you get it?
- From a burnt-out mission.
A friend of mine found it the night you left Singapore.
You remember that mission, don't you?
There was much confusion that night.
Some people died during the bombing.
I know.
Unfortunately the wrong ones.
I would gladly give you this as a souvenir.
When you sell me the other pearls, the ones I know you have hidden.
No deal. And stop bothering me.
I'm not going to be here long and I've quit being sociable.
Mr Gordon.
Singapore is a very interesting city.
You will be here longer than you think.
Sascha.
Mr Gordon doesn't want to be sociable.
- Ah ..
We do.
Watch him closely.
Did you use my bottle of perfume?
The one I bought at the bazaar.
Did I what?
My bottle of perfume.
I left it here in this drawer.
Were you using it?
I haven't used perfume since the day I proposed to you.
Sometimes I wish I hadn't.
I remember. You were so romantic.
Perhaps the maid moved it.
Why don't you ask her?
I don't care if something is missing.
We're insured.
Ahh!
I did again! Of all the ..
Didn't they ever hear of using a pipe to take the water from there to over here.
Going all over the floor.
Look at that mess.
Darling, it's the little inconveniences that make the orient so interesting.
Hurry up and get dressed.
I don't want to be late.
Where you dragging me to tonight?
To the Chinese Theatre.
Mr Gordon says it’s a must.
They are giving Hamlet.
- Hamlet. In Chinese.
Are your rooms comfortable?
Outside of the bathtub I mean.
Oh perfect. We have a lovely suite.
The reason I ask is that I lived in it for some time before the war.
It .. holds a lot of memories for me.
I imagine it is pretty much the same as it was, isn't it?
That is, it could still use a few coats of paint.
And how. Our plaster is about to fall off.
Maybe they leave it that way to please the women.
Mrs Bellows calls it "quaint".
I think I agree with Mrs Bellows.
You wouldn't if you had to sit in one of her antique chairs.
I've fallen through four times.
- Oh, Gerald.
Mr Gordon, are you familiar with the temple in South Bridge Road?
Oh yes.
And it is a must for every tourist.
There, Gerald. What did I tell you.
I don't care if it is far.
We're going there tomorrow.
They say, once you hear the local people put on a wonderful religious ceremony.
They walk on a heaving bed of fire.
That's a quaint thing to do.
Linda.
Linda.
Oh, were you speaking to me?
You don't know me?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't.
I think you are confusing my wife with someone else.
I guess so. I beg your pardon.
That's quite alright.
So sorry.
Pardon me.
What is the name of the gentleman with the lady in the white dress?
They are just sitting down at the second table.
Yes, sir.
Mr and Mrs Van Leyden.
He owns a plantation in Medan.
They are guests of Mr Lew Chin.
Head of the Empire Bank.
Thanks.
Good morning, sir.
- Is Mrs Van Leyden home?
Your name, sir?
- Matt Gordon.
I'm an old friend of hers.
Step in, please.
Wait in there. I will announce you.
Pardon me, madam.
A Mr Gordon to see you.
- Gordon?
I don't know anyone ..
- He said he's an old friend.
Oh.
I didn't think I recognised the name.
You spoke to me last night.
Look, Linda.
There is no-one around now.
What's the matter?
What's happened to you?
My name isn't Linda.
What kind of a game is this?
Why don't you want to know me?
You must be mistaken.
I've never heard of Linda.
Linda Grahame.
With an "E" on the end.
Doesn't that sound familiar?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid it doesn't.
Maybe I can refresh your memory.
We met here in Singapore five years ago.
You had servant named Ming Ling.
Ming Ling?
You've forgotten her too, huh?
And I suppose you don't remember
Commissioner Hewitt either?
I've met Commissioner Hewitt but he never called me Linda.
Ann!
Yes, Michael?
Come along, my darling. We're waiting for you to play doubles.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
This is Mr Gordon.
My husband Michael Van Leyden.
How do you do.
- Hello.
We sort of met last night.
- That's right.
Michael.
Mr Gordon insists that I'm someone else.
A "Miss Grahame".
Or is "Mrs"?
It is "Miss".
Obviously a case of mistaken identity.
But Mr Gordon says ..
- Ann, can I speak to you a moment?
Yes of course.
- Will you excuse us?
Certainly.
Well darling, we knew something like this might happen one day, didn't we.
Yes. We talked about it so often.
I thought I'd be prepared but ..
Now that it has happened, it's quite a shock.
To see someone who says he knows me.
Mentions names, people.
And not to be able to remember.
It's like hearing about a stranger.
Linda Grahame.
She is a stranger, Ann.
But he may be able to help us, Michael.
He seems to be sincere.
Perhaps he is.
The point is, do we want to find out?
I don't know.
I'm so mixed up.
Darling.
Have you been happy with me?
Yes. You know that.
Well there is your answer.
We don't have to know about the past.
Would it make any difference to you?
Perhaps.
It might make a lot of difference to both of us.
I rather expected this visit.
So I thought I'd try and find out who Mr Gordon was.
I did. From the police.
They are very interested in him.
Do you trust me?
More than myself.
Thank you, darling.
Now let me handle this alone will you.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Mrs Van Leyden sends her apologies.
That's understandable.
- You knew my wife before the war?
Yes, I knew her.
And you're still concerned about her?
- Sure, I'm concerned about her.
What's wrong with her?
Why can't she remember me?
Mr Gordon, she remembers none of her past.
She only recalls her life from the time she woke in hospital after an air-raid.
So that's what happened.
- Hmm.
We met in that hospital.
We were three years in a prison camp.
We were married.
We built a whole new life.
She is happy and I want her to remain that way.
But how can she be happy if she doesn't remember the greater part of her life?
Maybe the best part.
What kind of happiness is that?
I don't think I made myself clear, Mr Gordon.
I don't care to know about my wife's past.
Well maybe you don't, but I do.
I think it is up to her to decide what part of her life she wants to remember.
And what part she wants to forget.
Anything else, Mr Gordon?
No.
Not for the moment.
If she's the best you can find, I'll take her.
I don't think you will regret your choice, Mr Gordon.
When can you have the papers ready?
It won't take long.
Get me a good crew and supplies for three months.
Are you going into trading again?
No. The sea is a good place to get your health back.
You don't look sick.
I'm not.
[ Telephone ]
Police Headquarters. Desk.
Yes. That's what we're here for.
Who?
Mrs Van Leyden.
I am trying to locate the address of a woman named "Ming Ling".
Well, I'm not sure. Chinese I suppose.
Can you give us a description?
You can't.
Well, that makes it a little difficult.
Do you know at least who she works for?
Linda.
Grahame.
Oh .. before the war.
Well, we'll do our best, Mrs Van Leyden.
Your telephone number?
If we learn anything, we'll call you.
Thank you very much.
[ Chinese language ]
Ming Ling?
You know Rock Canal?
[ Chinese language ]
You know Ming Ling?
Mrs Grahame!
Mrs Grahame!
Mrs Grahame!
I thought you dead.
Ming Ling?
Ming Ling. Yes.
So happy.
Remember? You give to me.
Always wear it. Always.
[ Chinese language ]
Come in house. My house.
I'm married, Missy Grahame.
Have beautiful babies.
It is boy.
A son.
He's beautiful.
Beautiful, yes.
There are two things I can rely on, my appetite and my instinct.
Gordon came back for the pearls.
They must be hidden in his old room in the hotel.
Then why hasn't he made the slightest effort to find if they are still there?
Because somebody else has that room now ..
And he's smart enough to know he's being watched.
By us and by Hewitt.
As far as I can see.
His only interest is in that lady.
Who now calls herself Van Leyden.
Ah, that's sentiment.
The pearls are business.
Maybe the two are connected?
Come in, Pepe.
Pepe and I used to work together.
Before I joined you in big business.
Pepe's had a conference with Mr Gordon.
Oh?
What about?
I'm a loyal man, Mr Mauribus.
What's in it for me if I talk?
Twice as much as if you don't.
- That's two hundred.
First. Be disloyal.
I'm in the business of manufacturing official papers.
Unofficially, of course.
Mr Gordon wants an
American passport for a lady.
The name is "Grahame".
He wants to take her on a voyage.
With or without her consent.
And when does this "voyage" take place?
Mr Gordon has to make certain arrangements. That's all he told me.
Could I ..
And if you want anything else ..
Sascha knows where to find me.
With or without her consent?
Interesting.
Very.
Call Mr Gordon.
He is in the writing room.
You will find her at the bar.
We'll .. take care of this later.
Hello.
I wasn't sure I'd find you here at this hour.
Won't you sit down.
How did you happen to pick this table?
I don't know. It's quiet.
Why?
I just wondered.
Your favourite drink?
Gin Sling, yes.
We always have them at home.
At the plantation.
Nothing for me.
I saw Ming Ling.
- You did?
It was difficult finding her, but the police helped me.
She too says I'm Linda Grahame.
What else did she tell you?
Not very much.
You see .. I didn't go to find out about me.
I wanted to find out .. about us.
Now I know.
- And you remember?
It was like ..
Like hearing a story about someone I didn't know.
Someone who is dead.
- Alright.
If Linda is dead, do you let her be dead?
We're alive, you and I.
We're sitting here.
It's the same table, the same drink.
Just as it was five years ago.
Can't you see it doesn't make any difference if you remember or not?
If I'd never known you.
If I'd seen you today for the first time.
I'd love you just as I did before.
Can't you see that?
And it's got to be the same with you.
Isn't it?
Answer me.
I wish I could.
There is no answer. There can't be.
Because you're married?
- Yes.
There is no happiness if it means hurting someone else.
Didn't my husband tell you how we met?
He said you .. were both interned.
During the whole war.
I was lonelier than anyone else.
You see, I didn't even have any memories.
The present was completely empty.
Cut off from everything.
Without Michael, there would have been no future.
You want me to keep out of it?
Is that what you want to say?
You can only be someone I met ..
Two days ago.
I must go now.
I won't see you again.
We are returning to the plantation.
What are your plans?
They are ..
They changed in the last five minutes.
Whatever they are.
I wish you good luck.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
Please let me go alone.
- Just one thing more.
I want to give this back to you.
One life .. one ..
Can we send your bags to the airport?
- We'll finish packing in a few hours.
Mr Gordon.
What luck. We were hoping to see you to say goodbye.
When are you leaving?
- In the morning.
In the midst of the dawn, so to speak.
- 5am.
I'd like to meet the maniac who thinks up tourist schedules.
Look, whenever you come to Minneapolis look us up.
Bellows and Sons. Plumbing fixtures.
Well, if we don't see you again ..
You'll be seeing me.
I'm leaving on the same plane.
- Oh, really?
Gerald, what a wonderful coincidence.
Yes, isn't it.
Mr Bellows? Excuse me.
The tour is leaving in two hours.
Thank you. We have one last temple to see. It's got a gold plated roof.
Gold leaf, Gerald.
I still say asbestos shingles are cheaper and better.
Come along, Gerald.
We have to finish our packing.
I'm so tired I can't stand on my feet.
All this packing and now you drag me to another temple.
If only you hadn't broken that Chinese vase.
I'm not a packer, I'm just a plumber.
The service department.
Hello. This is Mr Bellows in 202.
The ceiling fan in my room has stopped working and it's unbearably hot.
Send a boy up to fix it and make it quick.
Just a minute. There's somebody at the door.
Come in.
Go ahead, Mrs Thorne.
What was that?
Yeah.
Wait just a minute. I can't hear what you're saying.
Boy.
I'm talking to New York. You're making so much noise I can't hear a thing.
Will you get out and come back in half an hour?
Just leave the ladder where it is.
Yeah. Go ahead Mrs Thorne.
Is Mr Gordon in?
Yes, Commissioner. Should I ..?
- No, no. I want to make it a surprise.
His room is 200?
- That's right.
Gordon?
[ Telephone ]
Hello Commissioner.
- Homesick for your old room?
No, I was ..
Saying goodbye to some American friends of mine. Just a social call.
In your shirt sleeves?
You and your British formalities.
Your friends must have left by the window.
Come on, Gordon. Let's have the pearls.
- Pearls?
I don't know what you're talking about, Hewitt.
It fits.
- May we take your luggage, sir?
Sure. Alright with me.
Just a minute.
Let's go to your room.
Why don't you look for the pearls in here?
They might be under the mattress.
- Forget them for the moment, Gordon.
I have a few questions.
Go ahead.
You'll find me as talkative as an oyster.
I hear you've met the Van Leydens?
That's right.
She was here in the bar with earlier this afternoon.
Yeah.
Did she seem alright when she left?
Certainly. Why?
Because she never got home.
What do you mean, she never got home?
She was expected at two o'clock.
It's now five and still no trace of her.
I thought you might know something about it.
No, I don't.
Perhaps not.
How did she leave here? In a taxi?
I don't know. I was in the bar.
Any ideas?
I don't like this, Gordon.
If you find out anything, call my office.
Deputy Commissioner Hewitt's office.
Thank you.
Tilson back from the docks?
- No, sir.
Any word on Mrs Van Leyden?
- Not yes, sir.
Did you find him?
- Yes. He was at the hotel.
Well, why didn't you bring him in?
- He had nothing to do with it.
Anyway, that's what he said.
And you take his word? When you tell me he's a criminal and a smuggler?
He's a gambler, like most Americans.
He smuggled because he loves the risk.
And trying to make a fool out of me is an added pleasure.
You make him sound very romantic.
- Where are you going?
If you can't get the truth out of him, I'm going to.
You won't find him at the hotel.
If I judge Gordon rightly, he is just as anxious to find your wife as we are.
Did he tell you why Ann went to see him?
No. But I can guess.
Mrs Van Leyden enquired at headquarters yesterday about Ming Ling's address.
Ming Ling was Linda Grahame's servant.
Well, they didn't give it to her?
- Why not? That's their job.
Come in.
Hello, Johnston
- Mr Hussein.
How do you do.
Mr Hussein tells me that Gordon commissioned him to buy a schooner.
Really? Did he give any reason?
No, sir.
I asked him if he was going into trading again.
He said no.
Nothing else said?
He did make a joke.
He said the sea was a good place to get one's health back.
I said he didn't look sick.
He said he wasn't.
There. You have it.
Ann's health. Her mental health.
That's all he could have meant.
And you say he wasn't planning to take her away.
That's all, Mr Hussein. Thank you.
Goodnight, Commissioner.
Now are you convinced?
You've got to stop him.
Bring Gordon in.
- Yes, sir.
If he is not at the hotel, send out a general order.
Yes, sir.
Hello Khan.
- Good evening, Tuan Gordon.
You would like drink?
- No.
I've been looking for you, Pepe.
Why do you think I'm paying you?
Where is she?
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr Gordon. You told me to wait.
Who did you tell about the passport?
I pay you to keep your mouth shut.
Who paid you more? Was it Mauribus?
Come on, was it?
Where have they taken her?
I don't know. They didn't tell me.
I swear I don't know.
You've got to tell the truth!
Where did he hide those pearls?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.
What do you say, Jimmy?
- Mr Gordon.
Long-time not have the pleasure.
- I've been away.
Give me a pipe.
Has Sascha Barda been around?
He does not come here anymore.
- No? He used to like the place.
Now he is part owner of the Macau Cabaret.
The Macau, huh? Coming up in the world.
That's alright.
- Thank you.
But I told you I've not seen it before.
- You're lying!
You were in his room the night I tried to steal it.
Monsieur?
You're new here aren't you?
- Oui, Monsieur.
My name is Gordon.
I have an appointment with Mr Barda.
- Monsieur Barda is not in.
But he may be here later?
Monsieur Barda might not come at all tonight.
I'll take a chance.
Do you have a quiet place where I could wait?
What do you wish, Monsieur?
I want to talk to Barda. Send him up as soon as he gets here.
Come in.
Don't you recognise this necklace?
It belongs to you. I saw you wear it.
You'd better remember soon.
Or you won't be able to remember anything.
Ever again!
What did he do with those pearls?
Sascha.
- Hmm?
The young lady is loyal to her friend.
Let her see if her friend will be loyal to her.
I am sorry dear lady.
But as they say in your country.
Business is business.
Where did he hide those pearls?
Why, Mr Gordon.
I never expected this honour.
Skip the preliminaries, Sascha.
You know why I'm here.
To bring the pearls, perhaps?
Mr Mauribus will be so pleased.
He always said you'd listen to reason.
You smell good, Sascha, but you're not very bright.
Not very bright and not very fast.
Now come on, I want my share.
- What share?
Of the pearls you stole.
Now don't tell me you didn't.
I didn't.
I didn't Mr Gordon.
Really I didn't.
Don't lose your temper, Mr Gordon.
I'm sure we can settle this peacefully.
Okay, Mauribus. I see your point.
Take his gun.
You shouldn't have hit me.
What makes you think we have the pearls?
Alright. You want to play games?
You got them from the fan in my room where I hid them.
You can keep them. All I want is my cut.
- I would gladly pay you, Mr Gordon.
Unfortunately, through the inefficiency of my associate.
I am unable to do so.
We have no pearls.
Somebody else ..
- Nobody else knew where they were!
Except one person and she ..
Hey, wait a minute.
Many gentlemen make the mistake of trusting the lady of the moment.
That's why she disappeared.
That's why she was so scared when I met her again.
Only this afternoon, she came to find out if I was suspicious of anything.
Sascha, you're not the only fool in this room.
Thanks for the tip. I'll get her.
I'll show her who is the ..
I can save you the trip.
The lady is here.
She is here?
I don't believe it.
A difficult man to convince.
Well, you're better than I thought.
They asked me about pearls.
This man showed me a necklace.
What do they want of me?
What do they want of you? How long has she given you this?       - 2 hours.
I won't take that long to find out.
Just let me alone with her.
I prefer to watch the proceedings.
Alright.
Come on honey, spill it.
So you wanted the pearls for yourself, huh?
Or did you promise your husband to keep quiet?
Is he in on the deal?
Come on. I don't want to beat it out of you but you're asking for it.
Come on, talk!
[ Buzzer ]
Get Mr Van Leyden.
What happened?
She's had a bad fall. Better call a doctor.               - I'll take her.
Call Dr Craig.
- Yes, sir.
Gordon, I owe you an apology.
For a moment I thought that she was ..
- Forget it.
Where was she?
- You'll get a police report.
I'll just wait around and find out what the doctor has to say.
She's had rather a nasty fall.
But no real damage.
She shouldn't have been unconscious all this time though.
Has she been under any emotional strain?
Shock?
Yes, I'm afraid she has.
In a kind of a coma.
Nothing to worry about though.
It will pass.
Well, that's all I can do now.
Well, stop in tomorrow.
You keep that arm of yours in a sling for a couple of weeks, Mr Gordon.
Well, that's that.
I guess I won't see you again, Hewitt. I leave Singapore on the 5 o'clock plane.
Good hunting.
Goodbye, Van Leyden.
Gordon, I would like to say that ..
- No speeches if you don't mind.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Matt.
Ming Ling, look outside.
Matt.
There, my darling.
Don't be frightened.
Oh, it's you, Michael.
There is no fire? No bombs?
No. Everything is quiet.
Where is Matt?
Matt Gordon.
I saw him again, didn't I?
Yes.
I knew someday he would come back.
I'd like to see him, Michael.
Just for a moment.
- He's leaving.
But I must see him.
I'll phone the airport.
No. Don't.
Perhaps it's better this way.
You love him, don't you.
I know you do.
Michael.
Don't ask me now.
It's all so sudden.
Things I remember now.
Are all the things that have happened in the past few days.
Oh, give me time.
I have so much to think about.
Sorry to see you leave so soon, Mr Gordon.
So am I.
The car is waiting, sir.
Michael.
- Darling.
Let's go back to the plantation today.
Everything will be just as it was before.
Will it, Linda?
I'll try, Michael.
I am so grateful to you.
You've been wonderful all these years.
The best friend I've ever had.
You know you can count on me.
Gratitude, friendship.
Everything but the one word I want to hear.
That is reserved for Matt.
You won't admit it because you're my wife and you don't want to hurt me.
I wish I deserved it.
But you do.
No.
For three years I've known all about you.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want to lose you.
I knew all about Matt Gordon too.
What happened to me.
It's not your fault.
But I could have helped you, but I didn't.
That young doctor that was on the plantation.
He said he could have cured you.
But I sent him away.
Do you still think I'm your best friend?
Yes.
I'll try and prove it to you.
Come along.
We bought nothing but antiques.
At least that's what they've charged us for it.
We're lucky.
Look at poor Mr Gordon.
Why that is an absolute outrage.
I'm glad they are my bags and not yours.
Why, he didn't even touch ours.
Where are they going with those? Gerald!
If they mess up those things of mine,
I'll go straight to the American Consul.
They won't, Mrs Bellows.
I'll take care of it.
A perfect gentleman, Mr Gordon.
They are in the that one, Hewitt.
In a shoe bag.
And ..
Just to make it worth your while.
Is this a confession or a declaration?
That's up to you to decide.
[ Tannoy: ]
"Final call, Flight 5."
"For Manilla, Honolulu and San Francisco."
Your plane?
That's still up to you.
Have a good trip.
You know, Hewitt.
I'm sorry I'm leaving so soon.
When I'm just beginning to like you.
"All aboard, please."
Mr Gordon?
- Yes.
Fasten your seatbelts, please.
"Now taking off. Fight 5."
"For Manilla, Honolulu and San Françisco."
No.
No reason for nervousness, ladîes and gentlemen.
We've been ordered back.
Please fasten your seatbelts again.
T-G öö
For what we are about to receive may the Lord make us thankful.
Amen.
It's all over,
Mrs. Thingummy.
The old story.
No wedding ring, I see.
Good night.
Pray come in, sir.
Thank you, ma'am.
- May I?
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you, sir.
- Ahhh.
This is indeed a pleasure, sir.
Now, you mustn't be faint at what I'm going to say.
You've had a long walk, or I wouldn't mention it.
Will you take a little drop of something, Mr. Bumble?
- Not a drop.
- Just a little drop... with a little hot water and a lump of sugar.
- What is it?
- I'll not deceive you, Mr. B.
It's gin.
I'm obliged to keep a little in the house... to put in the infants' daffy when they ain't well.
You're a very humane woman,
Mrs. Corney.
I shall take an early opportunity of mentioning it to the Board, Mrs. Corney.
Thank you, sir.
I drink to your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Corney.
We are forgetting business, ma'am.
The child that was half baptized
Oliver Twist is nine year old today.
He's the worst disposed boy I ever did see.
Small wonder. We've never been able to discover his parentage.
- How come that he has a name, then?
- I invented it.
- You, Mr. Bumble?
- I, Mrs. Corney.
I name all our foundlings in alphabetical order.
The last was an "S."
"Swabble" I named him.
This was a "T."
"Twist" I named him.
Why, you're quite a literary character, sir.
Well, well, perhaps
I may be, Mrs. Corney.
Perhaps I may be.
Now, let me see the boy.
Twist!
Come here!
Make a bow to the gentleman.
You're to come along with me, boy.
You're to be presented to the Board.
Gentlemen, it is my considered opinion... that our charity is being presumed upon.
- Here, here.
- Here, here.
This workhouse has become a place of entertainment for the poorer classes.
Gentlemen, it is our duty to set this to rights.
- We'll stop it in no time.
- Here, here.
Come in.
Case number six.
Bow to the Board.
What's your name, boy?
Oliver.
Oliver Twist, sir.
Do you know it's your birthday?
- No, sir.
- Boy's a fool.
Boy, listen to me.
You know you're an orphan.
What is that, sir?
- Boy's a fool. I thought he was.
- Hush.
You know you've got no father or mother and were brought up by the parish.
- Don't you?
- Yes, sir.
I hope you say your prayers every night.
Yes, sir.
And pray for the people who feed you and take care of you.
Yes, sir.
Well, you're going to be educated and taught a useful trade.
You'll begin to pick oakum tomorrow morning at 6:00.
For this abounding provision,
O Lord, we thank thee.
Amen.
Please, sir,
I want some more.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- Asked for more?
- Ah, good morning, Mr. Bumble, sir.
- Good morning.
I've just taken the measure of the two women that died last night.
Coffins are looking up,
Mr. Sowerberry.
Ah, thank you.
You'll make your fortune,
Mr. Sowerberry.
The prices allowed by the Board are very small, Mr. Bumble.
So are the coffins.
Well, well, Mr. Bumble, there's no denying that.
- But we must have some profit.
- Oh, is that so?
By the way, you don't know of anybody who wants a boy, do you?
A parochial apprentice.
Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry.
Liberal terms.
I'll take him.
- Oliver.
- Yes, sir?
Pull that cap off your eye.
And hold your head up some.
Be good enough to tell Mr. Sowerberry that the beadle is here.
Oh, please do come in, sir.
Is that you, Mr. Bumble?
No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.
Here, I brought the boy.
Ah.
- So this is the boy, is it?
- Yes, sir.
Who's that?
My dear, this is the boy from the workhouse I told you of.
He's very small.
He is rather small, ma'am.
He is small, there's no denying it.
But he'll grow,
Mrs. Sowerberry.
I dare say he will, on our food and our drink.
There, get downstairs, little bag of bones.
Charlotte!
Yes, ma'am?
Give the boy some of the cold bits put by for Trip.
Yes, ma'am.
I suppose you're the new boy, ain't ya?
Yes, sir.
- There you are.
- Oh, thank you, ma'am.
On the box, Workhouse.
On the box.
Workhouse, do you know who I am?
No, sir.
I'm Mr. Noah Claypole.
And you're under me, so don't you forget it.
No, sir.
- Are you done?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then come with me.
Come on. Get up.
Your bed's under the counter.
- You don't mind, I suppose?
- No, ma'am.
Doesn't much matter whether you do or you don't, for you can't sleep anywhere else.
Here. Take this.
Get in here.
A very good-looking boy, that, my dear.
He need be.
He eats enough.
There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear, which is very interesting.
- Well?
- He'd make a delightful mute, my love.
I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but only for children's practice.
Depend upon it. It would have a most superb effect.
Do you want a coffin?
I'll fetch the missus.
No. No, no.
I want to see the boy.
Who? Workhouse?
He's on the job.
Who are you?
I knew his mother.
Nursed her when she died.
Died in the workhouse, eh?
I haven't got much time.
I've got to see him.
Missus! Charlotte!
Missus!
Come in.
How is she this evening?
She hasn't much strength left in her.
She's troubled in her mind.
And when the fits aren't on... and that's not often... she keeps saying she's got something to tell.
She wants to see the matron.
You'd better fetch her.
Come in.
Yes?
If you please, mistress, old Sally's a-going fast.
Well, what's that to me?
I can't keep her alive, can I?
She says she's got something to tell that you must hear.
She'll never die quiet until you come, mistress.
- Did she say any more, Martha dear?
- Not a word.
- Cold night, Mrs. Corney.
- Very cold indeed, sir.
If you have to wait long,
I shall be surprised.
Put the light on the floor.
She won't see it there.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
It won't be long, mistress.
None of us have to wait long.
It'll come soon enough for us all.
- Who's that?
- Hush, hush.
- Who's that?
- Lie down, dear. Lie down.
Come here.
Come here.
- Listen.
- Yes?
In this very room, in this very bed...
I once nursed a pretty, young creature.
She gave birth to a boy and died.
Go on. Yes?
They would have treated him better if they'd have known it all.
Known what?
Let me think.
It was the year...
Never mind about the year.
What about him?
Aye, what about him?
What about...
I know. Uh...
- Turn them away.
- Mrs. Annie, dear.
- Make haste. Make haste.
- Get out! Go on! Get out! Hurry!
Get out!
Right. Go on.
What?
- Stone dead.
- What was it, mistress?
Nothing. Nothing to tell after all. Nothing.
Come up and sit by the fire, Noah dear.
Oliver, shut that door behind Mr. Noah's back.
I saved a nice bit of bacon from the master's breakfast for you, Noah dear.
Oliver, here's your tea, and take them bits.
And make haste, 'cause they want you to mind shop.
- D'you hear?
- D'you hear, Workhouse?
Workhouse, how's your mother?
- She's dead.
- What'd she die of, Workhouse?
They said she died of a broken heart.
What set you a-sniveling?
- Not you.
- Oh, not me, eh?
No, not you. You'd better stop saying things about my mother.
"Better stop." Workhouse, don't be impudent.
You know, Workhouse, your mother must have been a regular, right-down bad 'un.
What did you say?
A regular, right-down bad 'un, Workhouse.
And it's a great deal better,
Workhouse, that she died when she did, or else she'd have been doing hard labor in Bridewell.
Or transported or hung, which is more likely than either, isn't it?
Stop it!
Sorry! Help!
Help me!
- Noah!
- Charlotte! Help! Charlotte!
No, no! Help!
Oliver!
Help! Aaah!
- The coal hole!
- No!
Yes! Get him in!
You little villain, you.
I'll kill you!
So long!
Oh! Noah!
Yes, ma'am?
Fetch the beadle.
Well, ma'am!
Where is this audacious young savage?
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!
- Oliver.
- Yes?
Do you know this here voice, sir?
Yes!
Ain't you afraid of it, sir?
Ain't you a-trembling while I speak, sir?
No!
Let me out!
Let me out! Let...
The boy must be mad!
It's not madness, ma'am.
It's meat.
- Let me out! Let me out!
- What?
Meat, ma'am. If you'd kept the boy on gruel, this would never have happened.
What's the meaning of this?
Young Twist has turned vicious, sir.
- Tried to murder me, sir.
- He nearly killed the missus!
- You're a nice young fellow, ain't ya?
- He said things about my mother.
- By all accounts, she deserved them!
- That's a lie!
Don't spare him, now.
Don't spare him.
Get up to bed.
He comes from a bad family, sir.
Excitable natures,
Mrs. Sowerberry.
That mother of his made her way here against difficulties and pain... that would have killed any well-disposed woman weeks before.
My parochial apologies, sir.
Twenty guineas, sir!
Twenty guineas. Did I hear twenty-two. Twenty-two guineas, sir.
And it stands at 22!
Time is running out, gentlemen!
- Staying in London?
- Yes.
- Got any lodgings?
- No.
- Money?
- No.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Follow me.
Come here!
- Who's traveling?
- A new pal.
Come in.
Wait 'ere.
Do you want him?
Come on in.
'Ere he is, Fagin.
My friend Oliver Twist.
Very glad to see you, Oliver.
Very. Aren't we, my dears?
- Yes!
- How far have you come?
I've been walking for seven days.
- Walking for seven days?
- Beak's order, eh?
Do you know what the beak is, my dear?
A bird's mouth, sir.
Sit down, all of you!
A beak is a magistrate, my dear.
Dodger, take out the sausages.
Sit down, Oliver.
There're a great many of them, ain't there, my dear?
- Yes, sir.
- We just looked them out for the wash.
I hope you've been at work, Dodger.
I 'ave.
Good boy.
Good boy.
And free wipes.
Ingenious worker, ain't he, Oliver?
Very indeed, sir.
You'd like to make pocket handkerchiefs... as easily as the Artful Dodger, wouldn't you, my dear?
- Yes, if you teach me, sir.
- We will, my dear, we will.
To work.
Terry, Fred.
Sit down.
Charlie, Dodger.
Oliver.
Oliver.
Clever dogs.
Clever dogs.
Never blowed on old Fagin.
Why are you awake?
Speak up, boy, quick!
I couldn't sleep any longer, sir.
- What have you seen?
- Nothing, sir.
You were not awake an hour ago?
No, no indeed, sir.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
Tsk, tsk, my dear.
I only tried to frighten you.
Did you see any of those pretty things, dear?
Yes, sir.
They're, uh, they're mine, Oliver... all I have to live on in my old age.
They call me a miser.
May I get up now, sir?
Certainly, dear.
Certainly.
They've gone to work, Oliver.
Make 'em your models.
Do everything they bid you do.
Take their advice in all things.
Especially the Artful Dodger's.
He'll be a great man himself one day and will make you one too.
Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, dear?
Yes, sir.
See if you can take it without my feeling it.
- Is it gone?
- Yes, here it is.
Ah, you clever boy.
Here's a shilling for you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
If you go on this way, you'll be the greatest man of the time.
He'll do.
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief! Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief! Stop!
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
- Stop, thief!
- Thief! Thief!
Give him some air.
He don't deserve it.
- Is this the boy, sir?
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.
Afraid?
That's a good 'un.
Poor little fellow.
He's hurt himself.
I did that, sir.
I stopped him.
I cut my knuckles against his mouth.
Come on, get up!
Make way there!
Make way!
- Come on!
- Don't hurt him, officer.
Oh, no, I won't. Come on, you devil.
Hold the noise!
Do you wanna get grabbed?
I can't help it.
I can't help it.
What'll Fagin say?
Where's Oliver?
Where's the boy?
What's become of the boy?
Speak or I'll throttle you!
Let go of me!
The traps have got him, and that's all about it.
What's it all about, Fagin?
It's lucky the pot didn't hit me, or I might have settled someone.
Come in, Mr. Sikes.
Come in.
None of your mister-ing.
You know my name.
Come in, you sneaking cur.
What're you hanging about there for?
Go on, get in, will ya?
Will you take a drink, Bill?
See ya don't poison it, neither.
Here.
What's he been up to?
Ill-treating the boys again, eh?
You avaricious offense.
- You seem out of humor, Bill.
- Yeah, maybe I am.
And you seem kind of out of sorts too.
What's in the wind, Fagin?
It's the new boy.
The traps have got him.
What of it?
He may say something that'll get us into trouble.
That's very likely.
You're blowed upon, Fagin.
I'm afraid, you see, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many more.
It would come out rather worse for you than it would for me.
Wouldn't it, my dear?
Oh, dear.
Somebody ought to go and find out what's going on at the police court.
Somebody ought to go there, Fagin!
Go on.
Charlie.
- And about time too.
- Ah, Nancy.
- The very thing. She's a clever girl.
- Here's to her.
- Nancy will go, won't you, my dear?
- Wheres?
Only just to the police court, my dear.
What do you say?
That it won't do, Fagin, so it's no use you trying it on.
- What do you mean by that?
- Well, what'd I say, Bill?
You're the only one for it. No one around here knows anything about you.
And as I don't want 'em to neither, it's rather more no than yes with me, Bill.
She'll go, Fagin.
Oh, no, she won't, Fagin.
Oh, yes, she will, Fagin.
Yes?
Is there a little boy here?
- Who are you?
- His sister
You'll have to wait.
The case is on now.
Now, what is the charge against this boy?
Stealing a handkerchief,
Your Worship.
- I'd rather not press the case.
- Hold your tongue, sir!
- Are there any witnesses?
- None, Your Worship.
What is your name?
What is your name?
He's been hurt, and I fear...
I really fear he's very ill.
Oh, yes, I dare say.
Come now. None of your tricks here, you young vagabond.
What is your name?
What's your name?
Hmm?
He says his name's
Tom White, Your Worship.
Very well.
Where does he live?
Where do you live?
Where he can,
Your Worship.
Please, sir, could I have some water?
Stop the nonsense!
Don't try to make a fool of me!
I'm afraid he really is ill, Your Worship.
I know better.
Take care. He's going to fall.
Stand away!
Let him if he likes.
How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?
Quiet! What's this?
Who is this?
I keep the bookstore.
I saw it all. It was another boy.
Why didn't you come before?
Couldn't get a soul to mind the shop.
Swear the man.
They bring him out of the court fainted.
He gets in a carriage with this gentleman, and they drive off.
He'll blow on us, Fagin, for certain!
That's the boy, is it?
That's the boy.
Nice-looking boy, isn't he?
I don't know.
I only know two sorts of boys: mealy boys and beef-faced boys.
And which is he?
Mealy.
Shhh.
Good night, Mrs. Bedwin.
Good night, sir.
Is Bedwin in the habit of counting the plate at night?
Because if she doesn't find a tablespoon or two missing one sunny morning,
I'll be content to eat my head, sir.
Your move.
Where does he come from?
Who is he? What is he?
If that boy doesn't deceive you, my good friend,
I'll eat my head and yours too.
- We shall see.
- We will. We will.
- Where am I?
- Hush, my dear.
You must be very quiet, or you'll be ill again.
You've been very bad.
Lie down again. That's it.
There.
Don't mind me, my dear.
It's all over now.
I'm rather hoarse this morning, Bedwin.
I'm afraid
I've got a cold.
- Now, how do you feel, my dear?
- Very happy, sir.
Good. Have you given him any nourishment, Bedwin?
He's going to have a basin of beautiful, strong broth, sir.
Mm-hmm. A couple of glasses of port wine would do him far more good.
- Wouldn't they, Tom White?
- My name's Oliver, sir.
Oliver?
Oliver White, hmm?
No, sir. Twist.
Oliver Twist.
Hmm, that's a queer name.
What made you tell the magistrate your name was White?
I never told him, sir.
Some mistake.
Some mistake, hmm?
Ah, have your broth, young man.
We must get you strong again.
As soon as you're well enough, we must have a little chat.
Oh, thank you very much, sir.
Fool, bungler, liar.
I paid you good money to make an end to the business.
One sniveling boy... and you have to lose him!
I'm worse off now than if I'd never set eyes on you... and farther still from what should be mine.
What do I get?
My money back?
No, no, my dear, not that.
I'll give you hope.
Do you know the workhouse where the boy was born?
Of course.
I traced him from there.
Then you must go back, my dear.
You must go back. Listen.
Tomorrow, two months it was done.
It seems a age.
Are you gonna sit there snoring all day?
I shall sit here as long as I think proper, ma'am.
And though
I was not snoring,
I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh or cry... as the humor strikes me, such being my prerogative.
- Your prerogative.
- I said the word, ma'am.
The prerogative of a man is to command.
And what's the prerogative of a woman, in the name of goodness?
- To obey, ma'am,
- Huh! as your late, unfortunate husband should have taught you.
And then, perhaps, he might have been alive now.
I wish he were, poor man.
You brute!
Cry your hardest, ma'am.
It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes and softens down the temper.
So cry away.
Brute!
You blasphemer!
Talk about your prerogative again, if you dare!
Get up!
Get away from here... or I might do something desperate!
Certainly, my dear.
Certainly.
You were the beadle here once, were you not?
I was.
Parochial beadle.
What are you now?
Master of the workhouse.
Good.
Now listen to me.
I want some information.
Carry your memory back ten years last winter.
The scene: the workhouse.
And the time: night.
The place: the lying-in room.
- A boy was born.
- A good many boys.
He was apprentice down here to a coffin maker.
You mean young Twist?
There wasn't a obstinate...
It's not of him
I want to hear.
It's of a woman.
The hand that nursed his mother.
Where is she?
She died last winter.
One moment.
Yes?
There was a woman with her when she died.
Can I find her?
Only through me.
It will be worth her while.
What if I've paid you for nothing?
You can take it away again.
I'm a woman here alone and unprotected.
Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither.
You're a fool.
You better hold your tongue.
He'd better have it cut out if he can't speak in a lower tone.
Now, let's hear your story.
You were with this hand the night she died?
- Yes.
- There was no one by?
No. She asked that we should be alone.
- Get out!
- Go on.
- She spoke of a young mother...
- Aye. whom she'd nursed in that same bed.
Yes. What of her?
I robbed her.
She wasn't cold when I stole it.
Stole what?
It. The only thing she had. Gold.
Gold? Go on.
What of it?
She chose me to keep it safe.
Yes. The boy's name?
They called him Oliver.
- Yes.
- I haven't told you all, have I?
No, no. Be quick.
She'd run away.
Her father...
Yes?
I was to tell him that...
What were you to tell him?
What?
What?
She said more.
You're lying.
She never uttered another word.
- But it was then that it happened.
- What?
A scrap of paper?
What was it?
- A pawnbroker's ticket.
- Yes.
The time was out in two days, so I redeemed the pledge.
Where is it now?
There.
- And this is all?
- All.
Is that what you expected to get from us?
It is.
Bless us and save us.
- Come in and wash your hands.
- Why? What's the matter?
Mr. Brownlow wants to see you, and we must make you smart as sixpence.
Come in.
Oh, come in, Oliver.
Come in.
Yes, there are a good many books, are there not, my boy?
I never saw so many, sir.
How would you like to grow up a clever man and write books, eh?
I think I'd rather read them, sir.
What? Don't you want to be a book writer?
I think I'd rather be a bookseller, sir.
Well said, my boy.
Very well said.
Now, now, Oliver,
I want you to pay great attention to what I'm going to say.
You're not going to send me away, sir?
No, my dear, I'm not going to send you away unless you give me cause.
I'll never do that, sir. Never.
Good.
Somehow I feel... that you and I are going to be good friends.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I trust you, Oliver, and I find myself more interested on your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself.
Are you fond of pictures, Oliver?
I don't quite know, sir.
Now, that is a portrait, a likeness.
She's very pretty, sir.
Yes, she was very pretty.
Any muffins for tea?
Hello. What's that?
The young Oliver Twist.
You don't mean to say that's the boy who had the fever, I hope?
That's all over now.
Come and speak to my young friend.
How are you, boy?
A great deal better, thank you, sir.
Hmm. And when are we going to hear an account... of his history, eh, my friend?
I think we'll have our tea first, eh, Oliver?
- Is that the bookseller?
- Yes, sir.
- There are some to go back.
- He's gone, sir.
Oh, I wanted to return some tonight.
Send Oliver with them. He'll be sure to deliver them safely, you know.
Yes, do let me go, sir.
I'll run all the way.
You shall go, my boy.
The books are on a chair by my table.
Fetch them down.
Let me see. He'll be back in 20 minutes at the longest.
So you really expect him to come back, do you?
- Well, don't you?
- No, I do not.
The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his arm... and a five-pound note in his pocket.
If ever that boy returns to this house, sir, I'll eat my head.
There.
Good night, dear.
Oliver!
- Oliver, Oliver, you naughty boy!
- Help!
Oh, my dear little brother.
I've found him.
- Thank heavens I've found him.
- Let go of me!
- You cruel boy. Come home directly.
- What's the matter, ma'am?
He ran away near a month ago from his parents.
- Hardworking, respectable people.
- I didn't!
He joined a set of thieves and nearly broke his mother's heart.
- You little wretch!
- I'm not!
- I haven't got a mother.
- Go home, you little brute.
- I live in Pentonville.
- Oh, listen how he braves it out.
- Come home to your mother, will you?
- I don't belong to them!
What's this?
He's been stealing again.
Oh, no, Bill.
Come on!
That's the only way to bring him to his senses.
Do him good too.
Yeah, and he'll get it too. come on, you young villain.
Fagin! Dodger! Look!
Aye, let's have a glimpse.
Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear.
Why didn't you write and say you was coming?
We'd have got something hot for supper.
What's that?
That's mine, Fagin.
No, no, my dear.
Mine, Bill, mine.
You shall have the books.
If that ain't mine and Nancy's,
I'll take the boy back again.
Now, come on, hand over, will you?
Where is it?
This is hardly fair, is it, Nancy?
Fair or not fair, give it here, you avaricious old skeleton.
Give it.
Take the books if you're fond of reading.
If you ain't, sell 'em.
- Help! Help! Help!
- Bull's-eye!
He'll tear the boy to pieces!
- Serve him right.
- No, you don't!
You stand off of me, or I'll push your head in.
I don't care!
I don't care!
Get out!
- What's the matter here?
- The girl's gone mad.
No, she ain't, Fagin.
No, she ain't. Don't think it.
Then keep quiet, will you?
No, I won't do that neither.
What do you think of that?
So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you, eh?
Wanted to get assistance?
Called for the police, did you?
We'll soon cure you of that, my young master!
No you don't, Fagin! You've got the boy. What more do you want?
Let him be, or I'll put that mark on you that'll send me to the gallows!
Why Nancy, you're more clever than ever tonight.
You're acting beautiful, dear.
Am I? Then take care
I don't overdo it.
- You'll be the worse for it if I do.
- What do you mean by this?
You're a nice, pretty subject for the boy to make a friend of.
So help me I am!
I wish I'd been struck dead before lending hand to bring him here.
He's a thief, a devil, a liar and all that's bad from this night on.
Isn't that enough of the old wretch without blows?
Come, come, Sikes, we must have civil words. Civil words, Bill.
Civil words!
Civil words, you villain!
Yes, you deserve them from me!
I thieved for you when I was a child not half his age, and I've thieved for you ever since!
If you have, it is your living.
Aye, it is.
It is my living, and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home, and you're the wretch that drove me to them long ago... and that'll keep me there day and night...
I'll do you mischief, a mischief worse than that... if you say much more.
No! No!
Oh, Bill.
That's the worst of having to deal with women, my dears.
But they're clever, and we can't get on without 'em.
Dodger, show Oliver to bed.
- He hadn't better wear his best suit.
- Certainly not.
The Dodger shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear that Sunday one should get stolen.
Well, Mrs. Bedwin?
I'm afraid he's lost his way, sir.
You mean he never went there, eh?
There you are.
The boy's an impostor.
It can't be. It can't be.
What do you mean, it can't be?
You old women never believe anything but quack doctors and lying story books.
He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir.
I know what children are and have done these 40 years.
People who can't say the same shouldn't say anything.
That's my opinion.
That'll be all, Bedwin.
Well?
I'll take the liberty, if you'll allow me, of helping us both to a glass of sherry.
Now in the dark a shorter maid...
Why don't you join us,
Mr. Fagin?
Delighted, I'm sure.
What can I do for you? Monks?
I expected him here before now.
Lay it on, will you, you stupid brute.
Don't you know the devil when he's got a greatcoat on?
- Ah, Nancy.
- Well?
Well, my dear, it's about the crib at Chertsey.
- Well, what about it?
- Oh, you know what I mean, my dear.
- He knows what I mean, don't he?
- No, he don't.
And don't stand there talking to me in hints, as though you weren't the first what thought about the robbery.
Shhh!
Somebody will hear us.
Let 'em hear.
I don't care.
There, there, my dear.
It was only my caution. Nothing more.
Now, Bill,
I've got the boy. You can...
What's the matter?
I don't know whether she might be out of sorts as she was before.
Go on, Fagin, tell him it's Oliver.
You're a clever one, my dear.
The sharpest girl I ever saw.
It was about Oliver
I was going to speak.
- Him!
- It's time he began to earn his bread.
Besides, the others are all too big.
He's about the size I want...
And will do everything you want if you frighten him enough.
When is it to be done?
Ah, to be sure.
When is it to be done, eh?
Tomorrow night.
Good. It's all arranged about bringing off the swag?
It's all planned. Now you hold your tongue and keep your melting pot ready.
That's all you have to do.
Now leave us alone, will you?
- What's the news?
- Great.
- And now, may I introduce to you...
- So is mine. a charming young singer who's never appeared in public before.
Miss Lucy Willow.
This morning early
My melody was such
I in my tea took brandy
And I took a drop too much
This is the only proof of the boy's identity, so I've got the young devil's money at last.
Now you can do what you like with him.
Get him hauled up for some felony, drag him through every jail in town.
It's not easy to train him to the business.
That's your affair.
If... it's not likely, mind... but if the worst should come to the worst...
It's no fault of mine.
Mind that, Fagin.
I had no hand in this.
Get out!
My old pal and me go to fighting
Like all the neighborhood souls
I has one with him then he has one with me
Then we come to blows
Look at the drunkards of London
Lying all over the place
There isn't a doubt
It's lovely, look out
For the human race
Artful, are you awake?
- What's the matter?
- Listen carefully, my dear.
I want you to do a piece of work for me... that needs great care and caution.
- What is it?
- I want you to dodge a woman.
I'll do that...
What do you want me to dodge her for? Not to...
Not to anything but to tell me where she goes, who she sees and what she says... and to bring back all the information you can.
Who is she?
One of us.
What'll you give me?
If you do it well, my dear, a guinea.
One guinea, and that's what I never gave yet... for such a pleasant piece of work.
- Barkers for me, Bill.
- Here.
- The persuader?
- I've got it.
Scrape, keys, center bits, darkies.
Nothing forgotten.
You take the crowbar.
Take heed.
He's a rough man. Mind.
- What's that?
- The boy.
Oh, one of
Mr. Fagin's lads?
Yes.
It's cold, Nancy dear.
It seems to go right through one.
It must be a piercer to find its way through your heart.
Come 'ere, young 'un.
Come here!
- Do you know what this is?
- Yes, sir.
Well, if you speak a word when we're outside, you'll get a bullet through your head without warning.
So if you do make up your mind to talk, you'd better say your prayers first.
Now then, look sharp.
We're late as it is.
Come on.
Sir.
You've come in consequence of having seen my advertisement?
Not here, sir. I'm afraid to speak.
Down the steps.
Why do you bring me to this dark and dismal place?
Because there are those who would surely murder me if they knew I was here.
Young woman, if you have any intelligence of this poor child, in heaven's name put me in possession of it.
Do you know a man named Monks?
Monks? What do you know of this man?
Before I tell you, sir, have I your promise... that my secret will be strictly kept?
I'll not turn on the others because, bad as they are, they never turned on me.
Have I your promise for that?
You have.
And nobody will ever learn how you know what you do?
Never.
Some time ago, soon after Oliver was taken from your house in Pentonville,
I saw this man Monks for the first time... and the other day
I saw him again.
He came to a place
I know called...
There. Take care of that, and do the most you can with it.
It's been trouble enough to get.
What are you looking at me like that for?
He's gone mad.
I've got that to tell you will make you worse than me.
Eh? Well, look sharp, or Nance will think I'm lost.
Lost? She's pretty well settled that in her own mind already.
Open your mouth and say what you've got to say in plain words.
- Suppose that lad that's lying there...
- Well?
Suppose that lad was to peach, to blow upon us all, first stealing out at nights to find the right folks for the purpose, then having a meeting with them in the streets... not grabbed, trapped, tried and brought to it on bread and water, but of his own fancy.
- Suppose he did this? What then?
- I'd smash his head in.
What if I did it?
I that knows so much... and could hang so many besides myself?
I'd beat your brains out.
- You would?
- Try me.
If it was Charlie or the Dodger or...
No matter who,
I'd do the same.
Dodger. Dodger.
Poor lad. He's tired.
Tired with watching for her so long.
Yes, watching for her, Bill.
What do you mean?
Dodger. Dodger.
Tell me that again, once again just for him to hear.
- Tell you what?
- That about Nancy.
What about her?
- You followed her?
- Yes.
- To London Bridge?
- Yes.
- Where she met a gentleman?
- So she did.
A gentleman she'd gone to of her own accord... who asked her to give up her pals, which she did?
- Well, she...
- She did all this.
She told it all, every word, without a threat, without a murmur.
She did, did she not?
All right, that's just about what it was.
- What did she say about the boy?
- I told you that before.
Again. Tell it again.
Well, he asked her why she hadn't brought Ollie with her.
Why? Why?
Tell him that.
Because he'd gone out on a job with him.
What more of him?
Tell him that. Tell him that.
Well, that she'd bring him to London Bridge... tomorrow, midday.
Yes? Why?
'Cause he'd be asleep.
She made me laugh when she said it.
Said what?
That she was gonna give him a drink with rotenone.
Get me out of here!
Bill. Bill!
- Bill.
- Don't speak to me. It's not safe.
- You won't...
- Let me out!
You won't be too violent, Bill.
I mean, not too violent for safety!
Get up!
Oh, it's you, Bill.
It is. Get up!
There's light enough for what I've got to do.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Oh, no! No!
Bill! Bill! Bill!
Speak to me!
What have I done?
You were watched tonight.
Every single word you said was heard.
Oh, I've been true to you!
By my soul I have!
Give me time!
A little time!
Good boy. Good boy.
Bill. Fagin lied, Bill.
I didn't tell.
He deceived you.
He deceived you.
He deceived you.
She told all her pals.
Not brought to it on bread and water, but of her own fancy.
She did. She did.
She did.
Murder.
Brutal murder.
Murder.
Brutal murder.
In the early hours of this morning, a young woman was brutally beaten to death... by one William Sikes.
If any person or persons...
"I first met this girl at London Bridge.
I went there in response to an anonymous letter.
I promised not to reveal the names of her associates, but in face of this terrible crime, I no longer consider that promise binding."
Lock the door on the outside and come when I ring.
Yes, sir.
- Where is my grandson?
- Grandson?
I warn you that every word that passed between you... and your criminal associates is known to me.
Is this a trick to deprive me of my inheritance?
You have no inheritance, for, as you know, my daughter had a child, and it was you who, for your own gain, suppressed the only proofs of his birth and parentage.
You can prove nothing. Your daughter ran away and was never heard of again.
Coward! Liar!
Where is Oliver Twist?
I know nothing of him.
We shall see.
Sit down.
How do you do, sir?
I hope you are well.
- Take him away!
- Idiot!
It only remains for me to tell you that neither of you... will ever be employed in a position of trust again.
You may go.
Fool!
I hope, sir, that this unfortunate little circumstance... will not deprive me of my parochial office.
Indeed it will, and think yourself well off besides.
It was all Mrs. Bumble.
She would do it.
That is no excuse. You were present at the sale of the locket, and indeed are the more guilty of the two in the eye of the law, for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.
If the law supposes that, then the law is a ass, a idiot.
If that's the eye of the law, then the law is a bachelor, and the worst I wish the law is that his eye may be opened by experience.
My experience!
It's Charlie.
- It's all up!
- What's the matter?
They've got scouts out everywhere!
Now, what's the news?
They've nabbed Monks.
And Sikes?
What about him?
They say he'll be took tonight.
They're looking for his dog.
Fool.
Come here, will ya?
There.
Take him away.
The dog!
Follow the dog!
Follow the dog!
It's the dog!
They've got his dog!
Don't leave us in the dark.
Who is it?
What are you gonna do? Sell me or let me lie here till the hunt's over?
We're in this together,
Fagin. Lock up.
Get me a drink.
Get me a drink, will ya?
Young 'un!
Blast you!
Can't you say something?
Don't you know me, Dodger?
Don't come near me.
I'm not afraid of him!
If they come here,
I'll give him up, I will!
You'll what?
- Come here!
- Get back.
- What?
- They're here.
Get that table here.
Help! Help! Help!
He's here! Help!
In the king's name!
I'm going out over the roof.
I'll cheat you yet!
Young 'un, you're coming with me.
Get me a rope.
Come here!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Don't go without me, Bill!
Heave!
Heave!
Strike them all dead.
What right have you to butcher me?
Keep close to me, young 'un.
Fagin! Fagin!
They've got Fagin!
Round the stack!
Get on.
Sikes!
Give me the rope!
Get that rope round!
Fifty pounds for the man who rescues the boy.
Get it round there!
Help!
Help!
We've got the boy, sir.
They've got the boy!
He's come back, sir.
I knew he would.
{2930}{3026}I've been waiting too, over eight years.|The park's down there, ain't it?
{3031}{3112}Yeah. The park?|Say, Earle, you feeling all right?
{3145}{3261}I will be. Just as soon as I make sure|that grass is still green...
{3265}{3312}...and trees are still growing.
{4011}{4069}Pass me the ball, there, mister!
{4627}{4687}He ought to be here now.
{4698}{4773}When he comes, stay in|the bedroom till he's gone.
{4777}{4832}I been hearing about|Roy Earle for years.
{4836}{4900}He's a real big shot,|and I wanna see him!
{4912}{4980}Okay, okay.
{5087}{5175}- Here they are now. Wally's brought him.|- All right, scram!
{5464}{5506}Come in.
{5519}{5571}Well, what kept you?
{5622}{5679}Ain't losing your touch, are you?
{5699}{5725}Where's Big Mac?
{5729}{5763}He's gone to California.
{5767}{5814}- I'm handling things.|- Who are you?
{5818}{5863}I'm Kranmer, Jack Kranmer.
{5867}{5925}- Copper, ain't you?|- Used to be. I resigned.
{5941}{6041}- I'll bet.|- You don't have to worry about me.
{6052}{6115}Since when does Big Mac team|up with ex-coppers?
{6119}{6151}I told you not to worry.
{6155}{6238}Mac wants you to go to California.|The car downstairs is yours.
{6242}{6273}Here's the keys.
{6277}{6373}Here's your route and some dough.|The sooner you get there, the better.
{6377}{6409}What's the setup?
{6413}{6483}You ever heard of Tropico Springs?|It's a resort town.
{6487}{6551}"Richest little town in the world,"|they call it.
{6555}{6618}You're gonna knock off|a top hotel there.
{6622}{6669}Am I, copper?
{6673}{6779}Mac spent a fortune springing you.|You're working for him now.
{6784}{6838}He calls the tune,|and you dance to it.
{7863}{7920}- Hello there.|- Howdy.
{7950}{7997}Is there anything I can do for you?
{8001}{8049}No, I was just looking around.
{8053}{8113}- This is the old Earle place, ain't it?|- Yeah.
{8117}{8215}But none of the Earles been around|here for five or six years.
{8219}{8266}You from the bank?
{8270}{8311}No, I used to live near here.
{8320}{8376}- It's nice country.|- Yeah.
{8380}{8447}- Howdy, son. Any luck?|- Not much.
{8451}{8521}Best place is that hole below|the Turner place.
{8527}{8594}Plenty big catfish in there.|Three or four pounds.
{8599}{8671}Three or four pounds? Gee!
{8699}{8742}Well...
{8747}{8801}...used to be a long time ago, anyway.
{8814}{8852}Maybe it's fished out.
{9004}{9039}Why...
{9043}{9125}Why, you're Roy Earle, the bandit!
{10435}{10485}Howdy, partner.|What can I do for you?
{10489}{10550}She'll take some water|and 10 gallons of gas.
{10554}{10641}Yes, sir. You bet!
{10713}{10763}Hot day, ain't she?
{10767}{10821}Ain't many cars coming|through right now.
{10841}{10892}Little early, I guess.
{10917}{10973}You're looking at the pride|of the Sierras.
{10977}{11047}Mount Whitney, the highest peak|in the United States.
{11056}{11129}14,501 feet above sea level.
{11134}{11259}I see you got an Illinois license plate.|You're a long way from home, ain't you?
{11275}{11309}You must excuse me.
{11313}{11435}I get lonesome and when a customer|shows up, well, maybe I talk too much.
{11439}{11542}Lonesome, eh? Yeah, I can see how|you would get lonesome out here.
{11784}{11863}Wow, we made it!|I'd sure like to shake your hand, sir.
{11867}{11939}Jackrabbit jumped in front|of my car and I lost my head.
{11944}{12033}- You sure saved our bacon.|- I saved my own bacon too. Come far?
{12037}{12088}- Clear from Ohio. And you?|- Chicago.
{12092}{12163}Mighty proud to meet you.|You sure can handle a car.
{12167}{12252}Me, I'm a bit shaky at it, but Velma,|Velma's my granddaughter...
{12256}{12363}...she's a good driver, but she gets tired|and I won't let her drive too much.
{12369}{12399}What's your name, sir?
{12403}{12466}- Collins.|- Mine's Goodhue.
{12470}{12533}Velma, Ma, I'd like you|to meet Mr. Collins.
{12537}{12592}- How you doing?|- Pleased to meet you.
{12596}{12666}Well, I guess I'll be on my way.
{12690}{12722}Out of five.
{12726}{12791}- Going far?|- Up in the mountains, for my health.
{12795}{12878}Well, I'm going to Los Angeles.|I lost my farm back home...
{12882}{12983}...but Velma's mother married again,|and she sort of invited us out.
{12987}{13130}- Now, I don't know if...|- $2.41, 3, 4, 5.
{13139}{13194}Well, I hope you make it.
{14991}{15033}- Hey, you.|- Yes, sir?
{15038}{15119}I'm looking for a guy named Hattery.|Him and another fella.
{15123}{15151}They all in Cabin 12.
{15155}{15200}- You the one they expecting?|- Yeah.
{15205}{15241}Then you'll be in Cabin 11.
{15245}{15298}Leave your car. I'll drain the water.
{15302}{15344}It gets awful cold at night.
{15349}{15441}- Get my bags. They're in the back.|- I'll take care of them, boss.
{15959}{16008}Hattery here?
{16032}{16058}Red!
{16119}{16171}There's someone to see you.
{16247}{16302}- You Roy Earle?|- Yeah.
{16306}{16393}Glad to see you. I can't shake hands,|I've been cleaning fish.
{16398}{16440}Meet my pal Babe Kozak.
{16459}{16516}This is Marie Garson.
{16591}{16673}Red, I want to talk to you alone.|See you later.
{16677}{16731}It's okay by me.
{16831}{16877}You don't like the idea|of the dame?
{16881}{16929}Even guys like you should|know better.
{16933}{17048}Babe got her at a dime-a-dance joint.|She's okay, looks after things for us.
{17052}{17130}Well, give her some dough|and send her back. Tonight.
{17134}{17166}Now, what about this job?
{17170}{17259}The Tropico season is just starting,|and Mendoza, our inside man...
{17263}{17319}...he says the hotel will|be full in a week.
{17323}{17391}There'll be plenty of rocks|in the strongboxes then.
{17395}{17425}When do I see Mendoza?
{17429}{17494}He'll be up the day he gets off.|He's in touch with Big Mac too.
{17498}{17571}- He is?|- He'll give you all the news firsthand.
{17575}{17607}All right.
{17611}{17652}Say, Mr. Earle?
{17656}{17756}I wanted to say that with you on the job,|we feel like we're in fast company.
{17760}{17792}I heard a lot about you.
{17796}{17860}When I was a kid,|I seen you in the paper and...
{17864}{17901}Yeah.
{17967}{18052}You can have your Roy Earle.|He don't look like much to me.
{18056}{18082}He's getting gray.
{18086}{18156}A powerhouse to some,|but he's a blown-out fuse to me.
{18161}{18254}I'll bet he's plenty tough.|Get out of line and you'll see.
{18258}{18338}All right, I'll see.|Let me tell you something.
{18342}{18397}You're asking for a smack in the nose!
{18402}{18469}- And stop arguing with me!|- I got some bad news.
{18473}{18520}Roy says we gotta send Marie back.
{18524}{18570}Why, that broken-down...
{18574}{18612}- I'll tell him!|- Yeah?
{18617}{18650}Well, here's your chance.
{18654}{18730}You don't want me to go back to L.A.,|do you? You tell him.
{18736}{18814}I don't know.|I suppose we need that guy.
{18818}{18878}But that's no reason|he should push us around!
{18882}{18927}He's not the boss! He can't get...
{18931}{19003}Go on, keep it up.|You're gonna win this argument.
{19008}{19066}Leave her alone, or I'll flatten you!
{19070}{19120}- You and who else?|- Just me!
{19125}{19195}Cut it out! You won't get|nothing but a black eye.
{19200}{19268}I don't care what anyone says.|She's not going back!
{19272}{19319}So you think. He thinks different.
{19324}{19413}I'm not going back to that|dime-a-dance joint if I can help it.
{19417}{19519}- I'll go talk to him.|- With him, I don't think it'll work.
{19880}{19919}Yeah?
{19939}{19979}Can I talk to you a moment?
{19983}{20042}Sure. Help yourself.
{20162}{20238}Why do you want to send me|back to L. A? I like it here.
{20247}{20287}Don't play dumb.
{20291}{20339}I don't intend to.
{20343}{20391}Oh, I know what's going on...
{20395}{20443}...but I didn't get it from them.
{20451}{20496}Louis Mendoza told me.
{20500}{20574}He talks too much,|and all he does is brag.
{20585}{20703}So you see, Mr. Earle, Mendoza's|the one for you to worry about. Not me.
{20780}{20867}I ain't worrying about you.|It's them jitterbugs you got with you.
{20871}{20915}They'll be throwing lead over you.
{20920}{20970}Oh, I can handle them, all right.
{20974}{21058}Babe gets tough every once in a while,|but he's afraid of Red.
{21063}{21112}And I can make Red|think what I want.
{21116}{21163}Got it all figured out, ain't you?
{21173}{21202}In a way.
{21262}{21300}All right.
{21332}{21418}Let things stay as they are a few|days and see how it works out.
{21423}{21480}Oh, thanks, Mr. Earle.
{21625}{21665}Well?
{21692}{21734}Goodbye.
{22515}{22555}Yeah?
{22559}{22652}Morning. This is me, Algernon.|Anything I can do for you this morning?
{22656}{22702}You can rustle|me up some breakfast.
{22706}{22750}Lady next door got your breakfast.
{22754}{22853}She thought I ought to see if you|was stirring around. Yes, sir.
{22863}{22916}Where'd you ever get|the name Algernon?
{22921}{23017}My old lady thought it up.|Pip, ain't it? Kind of gives me class.
{23081}{23107}You like this dog?
{23112}{23186}- He's just a dog, ain't he?|- No, sir. A mighty fine dog.
{23190}{23226}Watch now. Pard?
{23231}{23285}Ducks! Ducks!
{23352}{23405}Down! Down!
{23410}{23461}Up! Up!
{23501}{23539}Jump!
{23561}{23616}Yes, sir, mighty fine animal, he is.
{23621}{23660}Proud of your dog, ain't you?
{23665}{23700}No, sir, he ain't my dog.
{23704}{23756}He took a liking to me and follows me.
{23760}{23823}- Sort of gets me worried too.|- Why?
{23828}{23928}Pard used to belong to a woodcutter,|who lived up here all year around.
{23932}{24042}Last winter, a snow slide come down|on that man's house and killed him dead.
{24046}{24141}Didn't kill Pard, though. A man saw|Pard wandering around in the snow...
{24145}{24241}...took him in, bam! If that man don't|up and die with the pneumonia.
{24245}{24291}Great big, strapping man too.
{24295}{24351}So Pard got to hanging|around the lodges.
{24355}{24451}And doggone if Miss Tucker|didn't come up here with the:
{24476}{24531}And I hear yesterday|she ain't gonna live.
{24541}{24659}So I'm just telling you about Pard,|in case you want him for your own dog.
{24732}{24776}Can I come in?
{24791}{24816}Yeah.
{24852}{24911}He breaking your heart|with the mutt's story?
{24915}{24965}- It's the Lord's truth.|- Look at him.
{24969}{25000}He's a born panhandler.
{25004}{25095}Everyone stuffs him, so now he won't|eat anything but a New York cut.
{25099}{25200}I guess I'll get back to the store.|Pard will stay with you, won't you, Pard?
{25284}{25349}Hey. Sit down. Have a cigarette.
{25353}{25380}Thanks.
{25384}{25445}- Where are your boyfriends?|- Out fishing.
{25450}{25482}That's about all they do.
{25486}{25544}They never catch any,|but they keep fishing.
{25549}{25595}Yeah, he certainly is spoiled.
{25599}{25664}Look at him. He knows we're|talking about him.
{25692}{25784}I feel pretty good this morning.|I felt rotten last night.
{25788}{25835}Nothing like a good night's sleep.
{25840}{25912}You ought to get out in the sun.|Do you good.
{25916}{25978}Where I been, they didn't|let me out in the sun.
{25982}{26054}Afraid I might spoil|my girlish complexion.
{26058}{26102}Must be terrible to be in prison.
{26106}{26182}Some are worse than others.|You get a mean guard on you...
{26186}{26276}...unless you got what it takes,|might as well climb tier 2 and jump.
{26280}{26332}- Some of them did.|- I don't get you.
{26337}{26437}Top of the cell block. It's a 40-foot drop,|and you land on concrete.
{26441}{26503}I saw a guy take a dive once.
{26510}{26547}He made quite a splash.
{26552}{26605}Yeah. That must be awful.
{26609}{26656}He just didn't have what it takes.
{26661}{26709}I was doing it too,|but I got a break.
{26720}{26810}How was it?|I mean, knowing you're in for life.
{26814}{26919}- I should think you go crazy.|- Yeah. Yeah, lots of them do.
{26923}{26975}I was always thinking|about a crash-out.
{26979}{27049}I tried it at the prison farm,|where they sent me...
{27053}{27130}...but the fix blew up and a screw put|the blast on me.
{27137}{27221}The worst of it was, they|sent me back behind those big walls.
{27226}{27345}We were just getting ready for another|crash-out when my pardon came.
{27367}{27415}Yeah, I get it.
{27428}{27535}You always hope you can get out.|That sort of keeps you going.
{27571}{27608}Yeah.
{27612}{27678}Yeah, sure, that's it.|You got it.
{27712}{27777}Well, I'll get you some more coffee.
{27781}{27838}Well, thanks for the chow.
{28040}{28093}You see that fella over there?
{28139}{28184}He better watch his steps...
{28188}{28252}...because that dog's got the hex|on him for sure.
{28256}{28295}Gonna put the evil eye|on him?
{28300}{28388}Yes, sir, the evil eye.|That little old dog's got the evilest eye.
{28392}{28480}His left eye just shines in the dark,|just like a cat's eye.
{28488}{28586}Algernon, if it's in the dark,|how do you know which eye is which?
{28699}{28781}Come on, Mendoza.|We playing cards or taking a nap?
{28785}{28838}I'm sorry.|My mind was not on the game.
{28842}{28884}That's for me. Thanks, Louis.
{28888}{28937}Dumb luck. Just plain dumb luck.
{28941}{28999}If you wouldn't kick so much,|you'd do better.
{29003}{29053}- It's all in the cards.|- That's right.
{29057}{29123}Oh, Roy, this here's Louis Mendoza.
{29139}{29175}Delighted, Mr. Earle.
{29179}{29240}Come on, Mendoza,|let's finish out this hand.
{29250}{29307}That's a baby!
{29311}{29377}There's that dumb luck again.|I can't beat it.
{29381}{29450}What's it look like at the hotel?|How soon do we go?
{29455}{29546}Oh, it won't be long now.|The visiting season is starting up north...
{29550}{29648}...and all the big shots have|been making reservations.
{29665}{29717}This is the layout.
{29849}{29897}I don't know.
{29902}{29986}Babe and I kind of figured|our best getaway was over the pass.
{29991}{30064}Nobody will expect us to cross|the Sierras to go to L.A.
{30068}{30200}Suppose it should blow up a storm?|If the pass got blocked up, then what?
{30204}{30258}Yeah, that's right.
{30262}{30344}Oh, by the way, I dropped in|to see Big Mac yesterday.
{30349}{30375}He wants to see you.
{30379}{30435}All right, I'll look|at the hotel tomorrow.
{30439}{30467}Drive in and see him.
{30472}{30517}Mendoza brought us a present...
{30521}{30567}...and, Roy, you're the engineer.
{30571}{30640}Big Mac gave me the machine gun.|Know how to work it?
{30644}{30712}- Red doesn't, neither does Babe.|- That's a good one.
{30716}{30795}- What's so funny?|- Does he know how to work it?
{30799}{30836}Yeah.
{30845}{30924}Say, that gun reminds me|of one time nine or 10 years ago.
{30928}{30993}We was getting ready|to do a job back in Iowa...
{30997}{31051}...when one of the guys|got the shakes.
{31055}{31138}Pretty soon, we found out that|this guy had talked too much.
{31142}{31213}And a bunch of coppers|are waiting for us at the bank.
{31217}{31313}But we don't say nothing.|Lefty Jackson goes out and gets his gun.
{31324}{31414}He comes back and sits down|and holds it across his knee.
{31418}{31503}The guy with the shakes is sitting|right across the room.
{31508}{31584}Pretty soon, Lefty just touched|the trigger a little...
{31588}{31679}...and the gun went... like that.
{31683}{31788}The rat fell out of his chair dead,|and we drove off and left him there.
{31801}{31864}Yeah, the gun just went:
{32093}{32180}I ought to be getting back.|I have to go on duty at 8:30.
{32185}{32216}What's your stunt?
{32220}{32276}You stick through the whole job,|don't you?
{32280}{32344}Sure, I stand behind the desk|and act scared.
{32348}{32411}When you fellas get through,|I phone the police.
{32415}{32481}We don't want no slip-ups, Mendoza.
{32609}{32725}Boys and girls, I got the idea that our|boyfriend here is no cream puff.
{32729}{32823}How'd you like the little bedtime|story about the gun that went...?
{32827}{32854}You get the idea?
{32859}{32900}You suppose he meant it that way?
{32905}{32963}Try talking and find out.
{34415}{34507}- I'll take a pack of these.|- Twenty-five cents, please.
{34710}{34749}Yes, sir.
{34900}{34990}- Thing at 316?|- I... 316.
{35279}{35361}They've got no money|or insurance. It's murder.
{35365}{35391}Tough luck, Pfiffer.
{35395}{35445}I should take it out of his hide.
{35449}{35519}- He wasn't driving. The girl was.|- I was! I was!
{35524}{35614}- What's an outfit like that doing here?|- It's a state highway.
{35619}{35672}The signal was on.|He had his hand out.
{35676}{35734}Wait a minute.|Will you let me get a word in?
{35738}{35820}I was driving along, he... Why, Roy.
{35824}{35871}- Oh, friends of yours?|- Yeah. Why?
{35875}{35943}I know I have no chance to collect,|but I'm curious.
{35947}{35998}I pull out and wham.|Look at my fender.
{36002}{36040}But you didn't make a signal.
{36044}{36116}You better be careful.|You might have to pay off.
{36120}{36202}Oh, a wise guy in on this?|All right, have it your own way.
{36206}{36253}I'll charge it off to experience.
{36257}{36283}What's the matter?
{36287}{36350}I got clipped, but I'm satisfied|if this guy is.
{36354}{36423}Well, I guess if Mr. Pfiffer|is satisfied, I am.
{36428}{36507}Come on, let's break this up.|Back on the sidewalk.
{36511}{36572}Hey, fella. These people|ain't got any dough.
{36576}{36623}That car's all they got.
{36627}{36715}- Stop it. You're breaking my heart.|- Fifty bucks ain't much to you.
{36720}{36804}- Sorry, but not a quarter.|- That's right. Saw the whole thing.
{36809}{36858}That girl was driving the car.
{36932}{36998}Look, she's a cripple too.
{37373}{37417}No, it was really Velma's fault.
{37421}{37526}She was gawking around, looking at|things and smacked into that fella's car.
{37530}{37618}I was surprised when he give|you that hundred dollars to give me.
{37622}{37692}I wouldn't worry about him.|He's probably got plenty.
{37696}{37749}This is the second time you saved us.
{37754}{37839}When Velma smashed into that car,|I had 13 cents in my pocket...
{37843}{37889}...and a $5 bill in my shoe.
{37893}{37949}The women didn't know|and don't tell them.
{37953}{38008}Pa, you're all right.
{38016}{38072}You said you come from Chicago,|didn't you?
{38076}{38150}I came from Chicago,|but I'm from Brookfield, Indiana.
{38154}{38192}Born and went|to school there.
{38196}{38226}- A little town?|- Yeah.
{38230}{38277}- I knew it.|- My folks got a farm.
{38281}{38368}I said to Ma out there in the desert,|you was our kind.
{38372}{38459}Yes, sir, I can tell them every time.
{38463}{38523}- Say, Pa?|- Yeah?
{38536}{38620}Excuse me, I suppose it's none|of my business...
{38624}{38672}...but what's wrong|with Velma's foot?
{38676}{38728}It's a clubfoot.|She was born that way.
{38732}{38757}Can't nothing be done?
{38761}{38815}A doctor said she could be operated...
{38819}{38901}...but the last few years I've been|so broke, we couldn't.
{38905}{39032}We hurried with the dishes. We|knew Pa would be talking your ear off.
{39039}{39104}Isn't the air grand out here?
{39129}{39169}Look at the stars.
{39174}{39244}I never knew there were|so many in the sky.
{39248}{39303}Back home you couldn't|see them like that.
{39307}{39404}It's always like this in the desert.|See that bright, blue star up there?
{39426}{39479}Look at it sparkle.
{39508}{39563}Look. You see that other one?
{39567}{39609}- Where?|- Right there.
{39613}{39709}- Oh, I see it.|- Yeah. Now, that's Jupiter.
{39730}{39775}How do you know?
{39804}{39905}A fella I used to know, he...|He taught me all about the sky.
{39909}{39967}Where we was,|we didn't have much else to do.
{39972}{40020}Is that star always up there?
{40025}{40084}You see different stars|at different times.
{40088}{40126}They change with the seasons.
{40130}{40200}Now, look. You see that one|twinkling over there?
{40205}{40277}Well, that's Venus.
{40284}{40353}Oh, it makes you dizzy|just looking at them.
{40357}{40439}Yeah. You know, sometimes,|when you're out in the night...
{40443}{40553}...and you look up at the stars, you can|almost feel the motion of the Earth.
{40557}{40696}It's like a little ball that's turning|through the night, with us hanging on to it.
{40700}{40801}Why, that sounds like poetry, Roy.|It's pretty.
{40870}{40962}Well, I guess I better be starting.|I got a long drive ahead of me.
{40966}{41060}Got a business appointment in L.A.|Pa, I sure enjoyed that dinner.
{41064}{41162}And we sure enjoyed your company.|Don't fail to look us up in Los Angeles.
{41166}{41225}We might get lonesome.|Especially Velma.
{41229}{41308}You shouldn't say things like that.|I'm surprised at you.
{41313}{41385}I declare, the older you get,|the sillier you act.
{41390}{41468}Oh, Roy understands me.|Me and Roy is old-timers.
{41473}{41513}- Goodbye.|- Bye.
{41517}{41577}- Goodbye, Roy.|- Goodbye, Roy.
{41731}{41785}Lucky girl that gets him.
{42418}{42445}Come in.
{42740}{42789}A swell parlay|for you tomorrow, Doc.
{42793}{42855}Still a sucker for the ponies, eh?
{42859}{42907}Hello, Roy, old-timer.
{42911}{42944}Hello, Mac.
{42948}{42987}You're a sight for sore eyes.
{42991}{43046}Yeah, I sure am glad to see you too.
{43050}{43138}Thanks for the spring. I was getting|ready for another crash-out.
{43142}{43208}- What's the matter, Mac?|- I don't know.
{43212}{43323}I can't eat. Just ain't hungry.|And I can't sleep.
{43327}{43415}Doc Banton says it's my past|life catching up with me.
{43432}{43481}Doc Banton? Is he out here now?
{43485}{43544}Yeah. I was expecting him|when you came in.
{43548}{43611}He's running a health service|with a phony name.
{43615}{43669}Help yourself to a drink.
{43679}{43749}Well, Roy, how does it look|and what do you say?
{43753}{43791}I can't see nothing wrong.
{43795}{43868}If the boys don't blow up on me,|it's a cinch.
{43872}{43943}But it's gonna make a big|noise in the newspapers.
{43948}{43998}Well, that's your headache, not mine.
{44002}{44069}The jewelry, that's all|I'm interested in.
{44073}{44194}Look, once you get your mitts on it,|keep your mitts on it.
{44198}{44302}Deliver it right here.|If you're hot, telephone.
{44306}{44350}This caper means a lot to me.
{44354}{44435}I spent a pile of dough setting it up,|and I'm in deep.
{44439}{44477}So don't let me down, Roy.
{44482}{44537}I never let nobody down.|You know that.
{44547}{44656}Oh, I know, but I've been dealing|with such a lot of screwballs lately.
{44660}{44748}Young twerps,|soda jerkers and jitterbugs.
{44752}{44835}Why, it's a relief just to talk|to a guy like you.
{44839}{44945}Yeah, all the A-one guys are gone.
{44963}{45037}Dead or in Alcatraz.
{45069}{45176}If I only had four guys like you, Roy...
{45184}{45254}...this knock-over would be a waltz.
{45258}{45335}Yep, times have sure changed.
{45366}{45413}Yeah, ain't they?
{45427}{45556}You know, Mac, sometimes I feel like I|don't know what it's all about anymore.
{45569}{45653}Yeah, times have sure changed.
{45734}{45797}Hide the booze. Hide the booze.
{45909}{45988}- Well, hello. Hello, Mac.|- Hello, Doc.
{45992}{46037}Look who's here.
{46041}{46150}Well, I'll be.|Roy Earle, the old boy himself.
{46154}{46179}Hello, Doc.
{46183}{46274}Last time I saw you, I was taking|slugs out of Lefty Jackson's chest.
{46278}{46352}- Yeah, that's right.|- Oh, those were the times.
{46356}{46436}- Not many of the old bunch left.|- Oh, cut it out.
{46440}{46507}Mac tells me you're doing|all right, Doc.
{46533}{46599}This is the land of milk and honey|for the health racket.
{46603}{46725}Every woman in California thinks she's|too fat or too thin or too something.
{46730}{46770}Well...
{46790}{46837}...same dosage, same medicine.
{46841}{46904}Need a new prescription? No.
{46909}{46991}- Well, good night, Mac.|- Good night, Doc.
{47090}{47181}He's in a bad way, old Mac.|Bum ticker, kidneys on the blink...
{47185}{47254}...bad stomach. Like a kid's toy|that's running down.
{47258}{47338}I try to keep him from drinking,|but there's no stopping him.
{47342}{47414}He'll go on doing|just as he always has done.
{47418}{47481}- Well, maybe he's right.|- Say, Doc.
{47485}{47545}- Yeah?|- There's something I wanted to ask you.
{47549}{47625}- Yeah?|- Can anything be done about a clubfoot?
{47629}{47696}Well, some can be operated|and some can't. Why?
{47701}{47796}Well, a good friend of mine's got|a granddaughter. She's a nice girl.
{47800}{47891}One time, a doctor told her old man|that an operation could fix it.
{47895}{47964}- I was just wondering if...|- Young kid, is she?
{47968}{48060}- Well, she's about 20, I guess.|- Oh, 20.
{48064}{48154}I see. Well, my advice, Roy,|is to forget all about her foot.
{48159}{48268}- Now, look, Doc, I ain't kidding.|- Well, I'll have to see her.
{48272}{48317}Will you take a look at her?
{48321}{48393}Sure, but you understand|I can't do any operating...
{48397}{48497}...but I can get you someone who will.|It'll cost you plenty, though.
{48501}{48576}- Okay, Doc. I'll give you a ring.|- Good. Do that, Roy.
{48580}{48728}And I'll make you a present|of my fee for old times' sake.
{48732}{48780}- Good night.|- Good night, Doc.
{48825}{48872}Roy.
{48937}{49021}- I don't know, Mac, the...|- Yeah, I do.
{49176}{49244}There. Now I feel better.
{49248}{49295}That's the works.
{49299}{49354}Now, if anything should happen to me...
{49358}{49425}...read this letter,|and you'll know what to do.
{49429}{49557}As the doc told you, if I don't lay off|this stuff, it's gonna knock me off...
{49561}{49631}...but I'm gonna die anyhow.
{49635}{49730}So are you. So are we all.
{49753}{49806}To your health, Roy.
{50049}{50090}- Hello, Roy.|- Hello, Pa.
{50095}{50120}Glad to see you.
{50125}{50193}This is Doc, Mr. Parker,|of the Nu-Health Institute.
{50197}{50248}- Proud to meet you.|- How do you do?
{50254}{50318}- He's an expert, knows his stuff.|- Oh, yeah?
{50322}{50421}After you called up I spoke to them,|and I think I've got Velma on my side...
{50426}{50482}...but Ma is against it.
{50487}{50588}You'll have to excuse the way things|look. We're getting straightened out.
{50593}{50646}- Roy, this is Mabel.|- How do you do?
{50651}{50748}This is her husband, Carl.|This is Mr. Parker, Mabel.
{50752}{50798}- How do you do?|- Hello, Roy.
{50804}{50849}Hello, Velma.
{50854}{50924}Say, I'd like you to meet Mr. Parker.
{50929}{50964}- How do you do?|- Velma.
{50969}{51038}You say, Mr. Parker.|Isn't he even a doctor?
{51044}{51112}I am a specialist.
{51118}{51204}Seems to me you'd be thankful|somebody's trying to do something.
{51209}{51311}You've nothing to say about this.|I'm thinking if he isn't even a doctor...
{51317}{51378}He can look at her.|That won't hurt nothing.
{51384}{51465}I don't think Velma wants him|to look at her. Do you, dear?
{51470}{51564}- Well, Pa wants him to. So does Roy.|- Who is this Roy anyway?
{51570}{51625}You know about Roy.|If it wasn't for him...
{51630}{51719}Why does he go to trouble to help|strangers? He must have a reason.
{51725}{51817}Maybe he likes Velma. She ain't|married yet and likely not to be.
{51822}{51888}- Lf you want my opinion...|- We don't want it.
{51892}{52016}- You got Velma upset talking like that.|- All right. All right. All right.
{52021}{52104}If you don't want him to look|at your foot, you don't have to.
{52109}{52142}Oh, but I do.
{52147}{52219}If the child's made up her mind,|I've nothing to say.
{52223}{52275}Come along, Mr. Parker.|Come on, Ma.
{52280}{52334}This way, doctor.
{52366}{52488}Roy, if this here specialist says|he can operate on Velma, what then?
{52493}{52592}- Operations cost money.|- Well, I'll loan you the money.
{52596}{52671}- I could never pay it back.|- I ain't worrying about that.
{52676}{52782}Oh, I know. I know.|Anybody with eyes in their head.
{52787}{52895}She's pretty, ain't she?|And just as sweet as she's pretty.
{52900}{52984}- Yeah.|- Are you figuring on marrying Velma?
{52990}{53058}Well, I ain't got that far in my figuring.
{53062}{53137}Well, I don't know|what's the right thing to do...
{53142}{53210}...but it seems to me|before you put out money...
{53215}{53281}...I ought to tell you about Velma.
{53310}{53354}Well, what about her?
{53373}{53468}Well, she's got a fella back home.
{53474}{53604}His name's Preiser. He's about|30 years old and already divorced.
{53608}{53693}He's doing good in insurance,|but it didn't look right...
{53698}{53785}...a divorced man running around|with a crippled girl...
{53791}{53895}...so Ma and me brings Velma|out here to her mother.
{53900}{53999}Now, it's my guess that Velma's|still thinking about that fella.
{54004}{54064}Now mind, I don't think|there's anything wrong.
{54069}{54197}I'm always telling myself there wasn't.|It makes me feel better.
{54218}{54290}That's about all there is to it, Roy.
{54300}{54373}I hope you ain't sore or anything.
{54417}{54491}No, I ain't sore at nobody.
{54520}{54610}I guess it sounds funny, and I ain't|got the right words to fit it...
{54615}{54767}...but it seems as if I'd been|close to Velma for a million years.
{54772}{54854}And knowing her like I do,|nobody ain't ever gonna tell me...
{54859}{54978}...she's ever done a wrong thing,|because I know. You understand?
{54986}{55042}She's not to know you told me anything.
{55047}{55136}- All right, Roy, anything you say.|- Roy, he says it can be fixed!
{55141}{55223}We'll soon have the young lady|walking as well as anybody.
{55228}{55327}Jiminy Cricket! Ain't that wonderful, Ma?|Now, honey, you just thank Roy.
{55332}{55439}Roy's the one. He thought up the whole|thing, and he's lending me the money.
{55443}{55504}You, Mr. Collins? You?
{55509}{55559}Why, I... I mean, I...
{55564}{55622}Oh, I hope you'll excuse|the way I acted...
{55627}{55713}...but I've been so worried about Velma.|I am her mother, and...
{55718}{55822}Mr. Parker will take care of everything.|You got nothing to worry about, Velma.
{55827}{55914}Roy, you're so good. Pa says|you're the best man that ever lived.
{55919}{55976}And I guess Pa's right.
{55994}{56035}Well...
{56053}{56097}...goodbye.
{56165}{56225}Darnedest fella.
{56267}{56307}Darnedest fella.
{56334}{56441}It's criminal nothing's been done for that|girl before. It's a simple operation.
{56446}{56499}I got an in with the best|surgeon in town.
{56504}{56595}The whole thing will set you back|about 400 bucks. You satisfied?
{56600}{56695}- Yeah, sure, I'm satisfied.|- But, Roy, I'm giving it to you straight.
{56700}{56771}You're just sticking your neck out.|She's not your kind.
{56776}{56881}She's gonna throw a fit when she|finds out what kind of a guy you are.
{56886}{56956}- Yeah, I know.|- You may catch lead any minute.
{56960}{57065}What you need is a fast-stepping|young filly you can keep up with.
{57070}{57153}Remember what Johnny Dillinger|said about guys like you and him?
{57158}{57243}He said you were rushing toward death.|Yeah, that's it.
{57248}{57302}Just rushing toward death.
{57570}{57614}Well.
{57645}{57724}What's the matter, Pard,|you been hiding out?
{58263}{58316}- Is that you, Roy?|- Yeah.
{58322}{58405}- Is Pard with you?|- Yeah, he's right here.
{58420}{58486}Hey, you had me scared.
{58521}{58585}- What are you doing in there?|- Come on in.
{58589}{58707}Gee, I'm glad Pard's all right.|I was afraid Babe had killed him.
{58865}{58937}- Did he do that?|- Yeah, he went crazy.
{58942}{59014}Red tried to cool him off,|but he fought like a wildcat.
{59018}{59082}He picked up a poker|and hit Red over the head.
{59087}{59133}He swung at me twice.
{59139}{59214}- Were they fighting over you?|- Red was standing up for me.
{59219}{59275}- When was this?|- About dark.
{59280}{59304}Where are they?
{59309}{59389}As soon as Babe knocked Red cold,|he ran for the store.
{59394}{59495}Then I heard Pard barking,|and Babe threw a poker at him.
{59500}{59555}So I ran over here|and locked myself in.
{59561}{59606}I found this under your pillow.
{59611}{59677}Figured if Babe sneaked back,|I could hold him off.
{59681}{59747}- He was like a crazy guy.|- Give me that. Stay here.
{59751}{59848}- You'll only get yourself in a jam.|- Shut up and lock this door behind me.
{60268}{60317}- Roy!|- Give me that gun.
{60322}{60394}- Nobody's gonna push me.|- Give it to me. Is he in there?
{60398}{60433}He's scared to come out.
{60437}{60490}- You were gonna bump him off.|- He hit me...
{60495}{60547}You wait right here. I'll handle this.
{60754}{60851}I had him hooked good. He was all|played out, and I'm reaching for my net...
{60855}{60927}Well, good night, fellas.|Here's my pal. I'll get along.
{60931}{61011}- I hope tomorrow you get a 10-pounder.|- Yeah, thanks.
{61016}{61042}Good night.
{61134}{61202}- You stinking rat.|- Yeah, I know. I went crazy.
{61206}{61280}- Marie tried to-|- That's right, blame the dame. Go on.
{61573}{61616}Marie.
{61787}{61890}Here he is. Mark him up.|Swing on him. Hit him with this.
{62021}{62064}No.
{62071}{62125}I don't want to hurt him.
{62208}{62278}Oh, Roy, don't hurt him.|He won't act like that again.
{62283}{62358}Your car's outside.|If I was you, I'd beat it, both of you.
{62363}{62462}- Roy, we've been counting on this job.|- I'm giving you a chance to blow.
{62466}{62545}If you stick, I'll shoot the first one|that don't do as I say.
{62550}{62608}Okay, Roy. Come on, Babe.
{62860}{62943}Roy, I'm not going back to the cabin.
{62965}{63015}No, you better not.
{63020}{63122}- The trouble would just start all over.|- Look, I found a cot in the woodshed.
{63127}{63228}- I could fix it up and sleep in the kitchen.|- All right.
{63233}{63322}I'll have Algernon get your clothes,|and I'll send you home tomorrow.
{63512}{63560}No.
{63682}{63731}No.
{63738}{63777}No.
{63782}{63830}No, I say.
{63845}{63900}You can't hold me.
{63968}{64024}Take the gates away.
{64029}{64081}I'm crashing out.
{64110}{64205}Yeah. Yeah, sure.
{64210}{64263}Sure.
{64274}{64411}I'll go back to the farm.|Sweet, Indiana farm.
{64432}{64553}But you're holding me back.|Don't hold me back.
{64558}{64626}I'll crash out, I tell you.|I'll crash out.
{64642}{64690}You...
{64700}{64744}...can't.
{64749}{64873}No. No, you can't do it.|Farm's the best.
{64881}{64965}Yeah. Yeah, that's the best.
{64974}{65040}You can't take it away.
{65044}{65096}You can't.
{65101}{65187}You can't take it.
{65248}{65362}- A little more coffee?|- Yeah. Well, are you all packed?
{65367}{65472}Well, Roy, I thought maybe I could...
{65477}{65554}I'll run you over to Ballard.|You can catch a bus.
{65561}{65604}I haven't got a soul in L.A.
{65608}{65664}- Where you from?|- San Francisco.
{65669}{65724}- Family there?|- Yeah.
{65729}{65795}Well, maybe I can stake you|to a ticket.
{65816}{65861}Roy?
{65873}{65937}Remember what you|were saying about prison...
{65942}{66045}...and the way you kept from going crazy|by thinking about a crash-out?
{66052}{66103}Well, that's the way it's been with me.
{66108}{66184}I've been trying to crash out|ever since I can remember.
{66194}{66303}My old man used to get drunk a couple|times a week and kick us around.
{66308}{66392}My old lady used to stand it,|but not me.
{66397}{66505}I waited for my chance, and I beat it.|I crashed out, just like you did.
{66510}{66594}- I got you.|- Then I came down to L. A...
{66599}{66663}...and got a job|in a dime-a-dance joint.
{66667}{66799}It was a living, but, well, I got|pretty sick of being pawed over.
{66803}{66909}So when Babe came along,|I crashed out again.
{66931}{67001}I thought Babe was a right guy.
{67015}{67102}I guess I was never hooked up|with any guys that wasn't wrong.
{67107}{67166}So I had nothing to go by...
{67205}{67260}...till I met you.
{67564}{67610}I'll get ready.
{68393}{68471}Go away, Pard, will you? Go away.
{68639}{68738}- What's the matter?|- Roy, please don't send me back to L.A.
{68742}{68810}Please don't. I want to stay with you.
{68816}{68916}Please, Roy, don't. Oh, Roy.
{68977}{69019}Listen.
{69043}{69090}Listen to me.
{69102}{69156}I'm giving it to you straight.
{69161}{69212}I got plans, see?
{69217}{69273}And there's no room in them for you.
{69278}{69365}You couldn't never mean nothing to me.|Nothing special, that is.
{69399}{69454}You know what I mean?
{69680}{69768}I'm gonna take a run to L.A.|I can't stand this waiting around.
{69773}{69860}Let me go along, will you?|I sure would like to take in a movie.
{69865}{69948}- All right. Get your things and my hat.|- I won't be a second.
{69954}{70027}We'll be back in plenty of time,|in case Mendoza calls.
{70031}{70116}If he ever calls. I don't like|the way he's stalling around.
{70121}{70167}I just don't like it.
{70220}{70325}- Hey, you guys keep your noses clean.|- Yeah, sure, Roy.
{70664}{70745}- Roy, Pard's following us.|- Go on home, Pard. Go back.
{70750}{70794}Roy, let's take him along with us.
{70800}{70853}Well, I gotta leave him sometime.
{70858}{70944}Yeah, you gotta leave him sometime,|so let's take him now.
{70986}{71024}All right.
{71048}{71092}Here, boy.
{71178}{71300}- You gonna take in a movie?|- I don't care. I just came for the ride.
{71308}{71388}I'd better take care of Pard|if you're going to a movie.
{71394}{71474}- Where you going?|- To see some people, friends of mine.
{71478}{71525}What's their racket?
{71544}{71658}They're not in any racket.|He's a farmer from Ohio, lost his farm.
{71662}{71761}There's him and Ma|and his granddaughter.
{71772}{71886}- Granddaughter, huh?|- Yeah, her name's Velma.
{71892}{71956}Just had an operation on her foot.
{71960}{72018}Mighty pretty girl.
{72030}{72072}Is she?
{72078}{72124}Yeah.
{72130}{72184}Yeah, and decent.
{72598}{72678}- Hello, Pa.|- Hello, Roy. Well, I'll be doggone.
{72684}{72720}- Where you been?|- How's Velma?
{72725}{72774}- You wouldn't know her.|- She's walking?
{72780}{72852}She's still in bed,|but the doctor says in a few days...
{72856}{72932}...she can dance and nobody would|ever know she was crippled.
{72938}{73026}- Say, that's great.|- Hello, boy. Hello. It's a cute little fella.
{73032}{73138}- Roy, it's about time.|- Hey, Ma, cut that out.
{73142}{73198}Roy's a nice-looking fella,|and I'm jealous.
{73204}{73272}Come on in and see Velma.|She'll be glad to see you.
{73276}{73327}Roy, you look so good.
{73332}{73400}Mabel's husband's at work,|and Mabel's uptown...
{73404}{73480}...so you got her|all to yourself today, Roy.
{73486}{73545}Well, I hear you're all right.
{73550}{73640}- She wants to kiss you.|- Oh, Ma.
{73708}{73758}We were wondering|what happened to you.
{73768}{73860}Well, I've been pretty busy. Did it hurt|much when they fixed your foot?
{73867}{73944}Oh, it didn't hurt at all.|I didn't even know it.
{74040}{74143}We'll never get through thanking you,|Roy. It was wonderful of you.
{74148}{74233}Say, I got a big business deal|coming up...
{74238}{74346}...and if it goes through the way|I think it ought to, I can quit for life.
{74352}{74412}Oh, that's fine, Roy.|Did you tell Pa?
{74419}{74507}I was thinking that if this deal|goes through the way it ought to...
{74512}{74611}...that I'd like to take a trip|around the world, and I was just...
{74636}{74704}Well, you see what I mean, Velma?
{74723}{74776}Yes, I see.
{74790}{74886}I was thinking that if you didn't|want to take a trip around the world...
{74891}{74936}...what would you like to do?
{74945}{75050}You see, Velma,|I'd sure like to marry you.
{75073}{75174}I ain't so old, and I'm gonna have|plenty of dough someday.
{75201}{75294}Gee, I don't know.|You sure been wonderful to us, Roy...
{75300}{75413}...and Pa says there's no better man|than you, but, Roy...
{75418}{75494}You got somebody back home, I guess.
{75509}{75573}Well, yes. In a way, I have.
{75578}{75652}He's figuring on coming out here|to marry you?
{75657}{75769}Well, I don't know. I may go back there.|I ought to be hearing from him any day.
{75781}{75856}Are you crazy about him, Velma?
{75911}{75992}Well, I guess that lets me out.
{76008}{76091}But we can still be friends, though,|can't we, Roy?
{76115}{76175}When will we see you again?
{76233}{76284}I don't know.
{76332}{76439}But I'll be walking in a few days. You|simply must come back to see me walk.
{76443}{76496}Why, of course he will.
{76518}{76566}Yeah.
{76589}{76663}I'll come back and see Velma walk.
{76864}{76965}- What's wrong, pet?|- He wants me to marry him, Pa.
{76969}{77059}And I said I wouldn't on account of Lon.
{77093}{77150}I don't love Roy, Pa.
{77155}{77207}I'm not crippled anymore, Pa...
{77212}{77266}...and from now on,|I'm gonna have fun...
{77271}{77339}...dressing up and going places|and dancing.
{77343}{77421}I'll dance all night long if I want to.
{77504}{77574}Oh, I know what Roy did for me, Pa...
{77610}{77669}...but I don't love him.
{77688}{77821}- Oh, I just don't love him.|- Oh, there, there, now.
{78021}{78095}Good morning. A man phoned|in a telegram for Mr. Collins.
{78099}{78184}Hello, Pard, you hard-luck dog, you.
{78345}{78405}Yeah, it's from Mendoza.|Tonight's the night.
{78410}{78488}Here are the three hammers.|Shall I take the sledge, Roy?
{78493}{78568}I don't know. I never cracked|a safety deposit box before.
{78573}{78624}Why can't Mendoza open those boxes?
{78629}{78684}It'd be a tip-off|that it was an inside job.
{78689}{78757}The cops would pinch him,|and he'd sing.
{78762}{78859}- Roy, what about Pard?|- Oh, yeah.
{78864}{78949}Take him to Algernon. Tell him|to lock him up. Here's 5 bucks.
{78954}{79039}- Why not take him along?|- Imagine taking a dog on a caper.
{79045}{79133}- I'd watch after him.|- You do as I tell you.
{79360}{79408}Well, I guess that's everything.
{79413}{79502}When we get into the hotel,|don't anybody look up, no matter what.
{79507}{79606}That's my business. Nobody's gonna|bother you, and I mean nobody.
{79612}{79661}Are there any questions?
{79666}{79730}Marie and I are heading for L.A.|With the jewelry.
{79734}{79824}Take the dough here. When you hear|from us, bring the dough to L.A.
{79829}{79873}All right?
{79888}{79929}Well, I guess we're all set.
{79934}{80029}I'm glad Marie's going.|She's got more nerve than most guys.
{80034}{80080}We'll make up her share between us.
{80085}{80122}- That's fair.|- Fair enough.
{80127}{80209}You bet. It's worth it to have|someone watch out for the car.
{80317}{80381}I'll never forget a guy I knew.|Petty Garrison.
{80385}{80459}Him and another creep waltz in|to knock over a store...
{80464}{80539}...and he leaves the heap outside|with the engine running.
{80544}{80619}They come out ahead of a shotgun|blast, somebody snitched.
{80624}{80702}So they ducks down an alley|and runs right into a copper.
{80707}{80786}- What a mess.|- You think of the prettiest stories to tell.
{80791}{80874}- They was smalltime, not like us.|- We wasn't big till this one.
{80879}{80935}- I don't feel big.|- Roy feels big.
{80940}{80986}Cut the gab and get going.
{81171}{81265}Pard's locked in. He knows something's|up. He's scratching at the door.
{81270}{81321}That little mutt's a plain nuisance.
{81653}{81763}- That's Pard. I told you he knew.|- Shut up and get in the car.
{81769}{81870}I wish that dog would stop howling.|Gives me the creeps.
{82289}{82382}- What's wrong with you?|- It's Pard. He's following us.
{82389}{82461}- He can't follow us far at night.|- Oh, Roy, you can't.
{82466}{82563}Who says I can't? What I ought to do|is put a bullet through his head.
{82567}{82644}We ain't got enough trouble|without a fool dog?
{82754}{82802}Let him in.
{82881}{82988}Poor little fella, got no home.|Got nobody, have you?
{82993}{83108}Well, of all the 14-carat saps. Starting|out on a caper with a woman and a dog.
{83113}{83191}- Lf he spoils this job, I'Il...|- Oh, you're full of talk.
{83196}{83254}I think you're glad.
{84143}{84174}- Mendoza!|- Shut up.
{84179}{84250}One move, I'll fill your pants|full of lead. Over there!
{84255}{84321}- I will, sir.|- Open it up, quick.
{84685}{84782}- How's it going?|- Having a little trouble with the boxes.
{85243}{85282}How you doing?
{85287}{85380}Got a few more.|This is really something.
{86116}{86220}- Quiet, peaceful little hotel.|- Nice time of night to build a house.
{86225}{86293}- Oh, Bob.|- Get over there. Shut up.
{86297}{86375}- Move over there. Move fast.|- Bob, my rings. Stop them.
{86380}{86475}- Look, my friend, you can't do this.|- Sit down.
{86480}{86563}You won't get hurt. Hey, you.
{86585}{86675}- Yes, sir.|- Sit over there.
{86693}{86750}- Go on, go on. Hurry up.|- Yes, sir.
{87746}{87793}Heist them, buddy.
{88306}{88384}You've got to take me. I never|thought we'd shoot somebody!
{88389}{88469}He won't croak. I shot low.|Go on, get in that car.
{88485}{88525}Police! Police!
{89256}{89322}Hey, he's taking the wrong road.
{89735}{89851}- The coppers will go to the fire now.|- Oh, Roy, those boys.
{89860}{89994}Smalltimers for small jobs.|They lost their heads.
{89999}{90067}This one was just too big.
{90305}{90392}- Hey, you feeling better now?|- Still kind of wobbly.
{90397}{90482}- I keep thinking of Babe and Red.|- No use worrying about them.
{90487}{90546}If they didn't kick off,|the coppers have them.
{90551}{90630}- Do you think they'll talk?|- Lf they don't, Mendoza will.
{90635}{90718}Who cares? I'll turn that box|over to Mac in a couple of hours...
{90723}{90822}...and he'll hand me a wad of dough.|- Then we'll be all set, won't we, Roy?
{90837}{90905}Sure. You got quite a piece|of change coming to you.
{90910}{91020}And I'm gonna see that you get it|right away because I'll be blowing soon.
{91025}{91089}- Going back East, I guess.|- I'm going with you.
{91093}{91130}Oh, don't talk like a sap.
{91135}{91207}Stick with me, you'll never be|in anything but trouble.
{91211}{91320}Look, Roy, no matter what happens,|I'm sticking with you.
{91325}{91371}Don't think you'll check me|so easy.
{91377}{91502}Well, we'll see. Come on, let's go.|Come on, Pard.
{91510}{91611}But remember, if the going gets tough,|I'm gonna have to park you for a while.
{91616}{91693}I'm glad you said, "for a while. "|That makes me feel good.
{91699}{91788}Look, if I really get in your way,|you can park me.
{91795}{91841}Is that a deal?
{91861}{91896}It's a deal.
{92178}{92227}I won't be long.
{92623}{92695}- Hello, Earle.|- What are you doing here?
{92700}{92780}Mac sent for me. I flew out a few|days ago. Mighty sick man.
{92785}{92853}He collapsed last night.|He's asleep now.
{92873}{92932}Hey, you want to read about yourself?
{92948}{92987}Tough about the two guys, huh?
{92998}{93070}- It was their own fault.|- Well, their troubles are over.
{93075}{93134}- Both of them?|- Mendoza broke his collarbone.
{93139}{93186}Got knocked cold.|He'll be all right.
{93191}{93259}The police haven't identified|Babe and Red yet.
{93264}{93330}Let's show the stuff to Mac.|It might cheer him up.
{93334}{93409}- You got it in that shoebox?|- Yeah, and it sure is heavy.
{93414}{93482}Earle's here.|He clipped them for a half a million.
{93486}{93559}I came through for you.|You didn't spring me for nothing.
{93564}{93635}Wake up, Mac, wake up, Earle's here.
{93683}{93771}Hey, this guy is dead.
{93934}{94011}- He's what?|- He's dead.
{94037}{94136}Yeah, cold as a mackerel.|Kicked off in his sleep, I guess.
{94246}{94293}What are you gonna do|with the stuff?
{94299}{94367}Mac told me what to do|in case this happened.
{94371}{94441}- He had a feeling he'd never make it.|- Don't be a sap.
{94445}{94546}Mac's dead, and we're rich.|I can get a fence to handle this stuff.
{94551}{94626}Listen, chiseler, I'm still working|for him and so are you.
{94631}{94678}I'm gonna follow my instructions.
{94684}{94761}Use your head, man.|This is a chance of a lifetime.
{94766}{94796}You heard me.
{94815}{94850}Okay, maybe you're right.
{95315}{95379}Pico-7719.
{95407}{95521}Hello. This you, Art? This is Earle.|Mac's dead.
{95533}{95630}Yeah, he said in the letter to call you.|That you was to do the handling.
{95635}{95742}Nope. Nope. He just kicked off.
{95746}{95790}His heart.
{95808}{95843}Okay. Thanks.
{95922}{95984}Hand over that box, Earle.
{96031}{96105}You give me any trouble,|and I'll fill you full of lead.
{96109}{96179}I'd be reinstated|and get a medal besides.
{96206}{96342}Just what I told poor Mac,|a copper's always a copper.
{96369}{96451}Well, this stuff's pretty hot anyway.
{96456}{96504}Here it is.
{96978}{97057}- I was getting ready to look for you.|- Get in the car. Drive.
{97062}{97137}- Well, what's wrong, honey?|- Bullet nicked me.
{97212}{97251}Go to Vermont and turn right.
{97336}{97446}You're mighty lucky. A little higher,|it would have been curtains for you.
{97485}{97524}Oh, that stuff sure burns, Doc.
{97529}{97615}Tell me, Roy, did you really crack|them for 500 G's?
{97620}{97701}We can't tell yet.|They kick up the price after a heist...
{97706}{97746}...but I got plenty of rocks.
{97751}{97839}You'll have to trust me on the dough.|I only got about 50, 60 bucks.
{97844}{97901}Didn't get your cut yet?|That's all right...
{97906}{97981}...but I figure this is gonna|cost you about 500.
{97987}{98076}Five hundred's okay with me.|When I need help, I need it bad...
{98082}{98141}...and I'm willing to pay.|- What about Velma?
{98146}{98218}Oh, I don't know, Doc.|That was just one of them things.
{98222}{98294}- Is she walking pretty good now?|- Perfectly.
{98299}{98351}My surgeon friend|did a magnificent job.
{98356}{98396}You ought to see her.
{98401}{98482}Maybe I will look in.|I promised the old man I would anyway.
{98487}{98526}Well, you better be going now.
{98531}{98582}Make a right turn here.
{98587}{98658}What about getting rid of the stuff|in Santa Monica?
{98663}{98735}There's something I gotta do.|It'll only take a minute.
{98740}{98784}Velma?
{98825}{98906}I promised Pa I'd come back|and see her walk.
{98911}{98983}Fine time you picked to go calling.
{99032}{99109}- Can I go in with you?|- You stay in the car.
{99114}{99185}I'm only going in myself|because I promised the old man.
{99190}{99246}Yeah, I know. You said that.
{99570}{99661}My foot gets stronger all the time.|Don't you think I'm dancing better?
{99666}{99725}Sure, baby.|How about a little drink, huh?
{99730}{99808}Oh, no, Lon. You want me|to get dizzy again like last night?
{99848}{99931}- Think he'll be all right?|- Sure. Joe's a panic when he's tight.
{99936}{100011}You said it, boy. Listen, I was...
{100016}{100107}Now, look here. Now, look here.|I never was one to spoil a good time...
{100112}{100185}...but enough is enough.|That's what I say.
{100190}{100237}Oh, who's that now?
{100348}{100381}- Roy.|- Hello, Pa.
{100386}{100465}Well, is this a surprise.
{100487}{100590}Hello, Roy. Well, it's about time|you dropped in. Where've you been?
{100594}{100673}The family's out for a ride.|They'll be sorry they missed you.
{100678}{100768}Roy, this is Mr. Preiser. He's my...|He's from back home.
{100773}{100828}Hello, Roy. Velma's told me|a lot about you.
{100833}{100882}We had drinks to you|the other night.
{100887}{100932}- Did you?|- Yeah.
{100937}{101040}Oh, you haven't seen me dance yet.|My foot's all better now. Watch me.
{101103}{101194}Go on, Pard. Go get Roy. Go find him.
{101247}{101375}This is a fine party, letting a lady|dance by herself. Come on, baby.
{101432}{101508}I declare. Who's that now?
{101580}{101655}Pard, you bad dog, you.
{101660}{101771}Gee, I'm sorry, Roy. He jumped out of|the car before I knew what happened.
{101863}{101929}Oh, hello. You're Velma, aren't you?
{101933}{102017}- That's right.|- I'm Marie Garson, a friend of Roy's.
{102022}{102129}I feel as though I know you.|Roy has often told me how nice you are.
{102146}{102216}- Has he?|- Oh, say, that reminds me...
{102220}{102292}...you did a lot for Velma.|I ought to pay you back.
{102296}{102380}- After all, it's a lot of money.|- Forget it. Think nothing of it.
{102385}{102427}But I'd like you to take it.
{102432}{102544}After all, Lon and I are going to be|married very soon, and he can afford it.
{102549}{102600}Getting married?
{102630}{102718}- Well, that's fine.|- Yeah.
{102723}{102846}Yeah, that's swell.|Well, I guess I'll be on my way, Pa.
{102851}{102942}I'm going back East.|I just came in to say goodbye.
{102948}{103000}Let's have a drink together first, Roy.
{103005}{103090}You and your little girlie|and me and my little Velma.
{103095}{103150}Get your hands off me.
{103167}{103235}- I'm sorry. L...|- I don't like you.
{103239}{103318}I don't like the way you talk,|and I don't like your friends.
{103323}{103398}- I don't like to think of her marrying you.|- Come on, Roy.
{103403}{103453}You've got no right|to say such things.
{103458}{103518}Lon's gonna be my husband,|and I love him.
{103524}{103635}You're just jealous and mean because|I don't want you. I never wanted you.
{103706}{103776}- I'm sure sorry.|- Oh, it's all right.
{103781}{103888}Maybe it's just as well it happened|this way. Goodbye, Pa.
{103892}{103937}Goodbye.
{103963}{104001}Some nerve he had.
{104006}{104087}If it wasn't for you, dear,|I'd have punched him in the nose.
{104108}{104197}- You shouldn't have come in there.|- I had to, Roy.
{104202}{104328}You thought of her more than you|did me. I just wanted to know why.
{104401}{104463}You don't love her anymore, do you?
{104482}{104528}No.
{104533}{104602}If you weren't sure of it,|you wouldn't have asked me.
{104739}{104817}If I didn't know where they come from,|I'd think they was phony.
{104822}{104882}Poor old Mac.
{104892}{105001}There he was, laying there dead,|with a half a million bucks beside him.
{105006}{105097}Well, it's all yours,|and all I want is my cut.
{105103}{105171}You're gonna have to wait a few days|for that, Roy.
{105176}{105217}- What's that?|- Don't look at me.
{105221}{105299}My share you could put in your eye.|Larry's the headman...
{105304}{105351}...now that Mac's gone.|- Kansas City?
{105356}{105413}That's him.|He's flying out.
{105419}{105507}Now, you leave the stuff with me|and hide out for a while.
{105512}{105551}I can help you out a little.
{105557}{105637}You ain't trying to pull a fast one,|are you?
{105643}{105702}Take the stuff with you|if you feel that way.
{105707}{105783}But it'll be like carrying|a bomb around.
{105798}{105876}Okay. Give me a couple hundred bucks|and keep this.
{105881}{105957}But if I don't get my end,|you ain't gonna be around long.
{105962}{106049}- You and Larry both.|- Oh, now, don't worry, Roy, you'll get it.
{106054}{106101}Here's the 200.
{106173}{106212}Yeah...
{106219}{106267}...that's what I want.
{106734}{106784}Oh, Roy!
{106789}{106831}That's a present.
{106989}{107086}Of course, you would put it|on the wrong finger.
{107734}{107765}Well?
{107770}{107842}Same old song.|Nothing doing yet.
{107847}{107926}I'm gonna run out of dough|with all these long-distance calls.
{107931}{107999}Should've taken the money|Velma's boyfriend offered.
{108003}{108090}No. "Think nothing of it,"|that's what you said. Sucker.
{108181}{108220}Roy!
{108227}{108302}Yeah. Don't look like this thing's|ever gonna cool off.
{108348}{108412}Look, I been thinking things over.
{108428}{108558}I like Pard as much as you do, but|Algernon said he's bad luck.
{108563}{108645}- That's malarkey.|- Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't.
{108651}{108726}How could a little dog be the cause?|That's plain dumb!
{108731}{108840}You think when you say a thing, that's|that. Nobody knows nothing, but you!
{108846}{108921}Okay, Pard's to blame for everything.|Have it your own way.
{108927}{108993}- I said, there might be something to it!|- Shut up!
{108998}{109058}Don't tell me to shut up, you...
{109167}{109276}Oh, honey, I'm sorry.|It's hurting you, isn't it?
{109281}{109351}You just let me change this dressing|for you.
{109426}{109465}Sorry.
{109478}{109554}It don't look so good, Roy.|It's all red.
{109559}{109658}- Do you feel as if you have any fever?|- No, I don't think so.
{109665}{109739}I don't know, maybe I have.|Think I ought to see the doc?
{109743}{109819}Oh, no, you can't do that.|They might get you.
{109824}{109942}You can't trust anybody, Roy.|After all, $ 10,000 is a lot of money.
{109955}{110050}You ought to turn me in and live easy|for the rest of your life.
{110055}{110158}Even in fun,|don't ever say things like that.
{110491}{110537}Thanks, sonny.
{110830}{110918}- Morning.|- Morning, Mr. Collins.
{111236}{111304}Baby, our troubles are over!|I'm driving in tonight.
{111308}{111386}I just talked to Art. He said|they'll have my cut ready!
{111391}{111444}We can go back East,|where we'll be safe.
{111449}{111526}I was beginning to think they were|giving me the runaround.
{111531}{111583}- Easy to be wrong in this world.|- Love me?
{111588}{111640}You bet I do!
{111694}{111741}Let him out, will you?
{111922}{111981}- Pains?|- Yeah, a little.
{111986}{112050}- Look, honey, I'll drive in.|- No, nothing doing.
{112054}{112134}- Suppose we get a rumble?|- They're not looking for you yet.
{112139}{112245}All the same, I'll drive. Go ahead with|the packing. I think the car needs gas.
{112368}{112442}Nice little Pard. Nice little boy.|Shake hands?
{112447}{112550}Nice Pard. Oh, he's a fine boy.|Nice little Pard.
{112666}{112757}- I wanna see you.|- I'm busy. I got a lot to do with...
{112762}{112848}A lot to do this morning.|That's a nice little dog you got there.
{112853}{112946}- Just trying to make up with him.|- What makes you think his name's Pard?
{112951}{113035}Didn't I hear you call him that yesterday?|Maybe I'm wrong.
{113137}{113181}Get in there.
{113342}{113379}You know who I am, don't you?
{113384}{113479}- Never saw you before you came here.|- What are you so scared about, then?
{113484}{113558}- Mr. Earle, please don't kill me!|- Open that door.
{113597}{113659}Looking for that reward, huh?
{113879}{113920}Listen to this.
{113931}{114036}"Police are hot on his trail. He's traveling|with a woman who answers to Marie...
{114041}{114118}...and a little gray-white mongrel dog|who answers to Pard. "
{114123}{114166}- Mendoza.|- Yeah, he squawked.
{114170}{114258}I should've taken care of him|when he followed me out of the hotel.
{114263}{114333}Look at the tag they hung on me,|"Mad Dog Earle. "
{114338}{114441}- Them newspaper rats!|- What are we gonna do, Roy?
{114445}{114490}Wait a minute.
{114509}{114567}I gotta park you for a while,|like you said.
{114573}{114621}- Like who said?|- Remember we agreed...
{114626}{114683}...if the going got tough,|I was to park you.
{114688}{114773}Look, Roy, I can't leave you now.|I don't care what happens to me.
{114778}{114859}Let's stick together, honey.|Let the money go. Forget about it.
{114864}{114955}- We'll head east, then we'll be safe.|- You need dough to get back East.
{114960}{115021}I've got 30 grand coming,|and I'm gonna get it.
{115027}{115066}Now, listen.
{115071}{115118}I got an idea.
{115124}{115232}I'll put you on the bus to Las Vegas. I'll|go get my end, then I'll come after you.
{115237}{115320}Roy, don't leave me. Please don't|leave me. I'm scared about it.
{115325}{115420}Think I wanna get you shot? When|they hang that number one tag on you...
{115425}{115502}...they shoot first and argue afterwards.|I know.
{115507}{115591}"Mad Dog Earle. "|How do you like that?
{115614}{115715}They've tied me with the Kranmer killing.|They get me, I haven't got a chance.
{115720}{115768}But they ain't gonna get me.
{115773}{115843}I've done all the time|I'm ever gonna do.
{115870}{115911}I'll tie that guy up.
{115915}{116000}You go on down to the store|and get a big basket with a lid on it.
{116006}{116136}- Put Pard in it and take him with you.|- Okay, Roy, I'll do anything you say.
{116548}{116623}Come on, Pard.|Get in, come on.
{116629}{116668}Get in.
{116673}{116764}When you get to Las Vegas,|go right to the place I told you.
{116769}{116854}I'll be with you tomorrow night|at the latest. You got that?
{116859}{116970}I just got a feeling about it, Roy.|I'm awful sorry for the way I've acted.
{116975}{117043}- You got nothing to be sorry about.|- Yes, I have.
{117048}{117118}Nagging at you|and flying off the handle.
{117122}{117173}I wish I hadn't.
{117188}{117268}I like it. I mean, that's the way|married people ought to act.
{117273}{117362}Listen, my ma and pa fought like cats|and dogs, going on 40 years.
{117367}{117451}I wouldn't give you 2 cents for a dame|without a temper.
{117589}{117633}Here she comes.
{117650}{117725}- Here, take this.|- That's all you got, Roy.
{117730}{117814}- I don't need that much.|- You keep it, I'm all right.
{117883}{117941}You're all I got in the world.
{118004}{118053}Come on, now, baby.
{118129}{118178}I'll see you tomorrow night.
{118205}{118245}Come on.
{119165}{119242}{Y:i}Turning from the European news,|a bulletin just handed me...
{119247}{119326}{Y:i}...states that Mad Dog Earle|has been identified as the man...
{119331}{119424}{Y:i}...who slugged a camp proprietor|this morning at Palmville on Route 395.
{119429}{119541}{Y:i}The bandit killer and his companion,|a woman named Marie...
{119546}{119607}{Y:i}...are believed to be headed|toward Los Angeles.
{120330}{120420}- Can I help you, sir?|- Yeah, give me a pack of cigarettes.
{120426}{120512}Don't give me no trouble, you won't|get hurt. Hand over the dough.
{120517}{120583}Yes, sir. Never get myself shot up|over money.
{120601}{120646}You're right, buddy.|You got sense.
{120651}{120750}- Well, John, give me a Coke.|- Look out, Tom! It's Roy Earle!
{121271}{121314}- What is all this?|- Hold up, Henry.
{121319}{121406}John thought it was Roy Earle.|Reading too many detective magazines.
{121411}{121504}- Looked like Earle's picture.|- Lf it's Earle, he's headed over the pass.
{121509}{121551}Operator, give me 420.
{121607}{121649}Sheriff, Holden speaking.
{121654}{121753}Paramount Drugstore has just been|held up by a man identified as Roy Earle.
{121758}{121814}{Y:i}Yeah, looks just like him.
{122140}{122212}Okay. Patrol car 41|waiting on High Bridge Road.
{122217}{122289}Good. We'll have him bottled up|in another hour.
{128882}{128948}Spread out, boys.|And watch yourselves, he's armed.
{129858}{129913}- Better keep under cover.|- Charley, Spike...
{129918}{129996}...work over to his left.|- He'll never come out alive!
{130001}{130071}We got him holed in.|I know this country. Hank, Sam...
{130076}{130134}...go up to the ridge, wait.
{130223}{130275}Hey, you!|You got no chance!
{130281}{130359}Come on down!|We won't do no shooting!
{130364}{130454}Come and get me, buddy! Come|and get me! What's the matter, yellow?
{130478}{130608}Get Slim up here with his high-powered|rifle and telescope.
{130679}{130762}{Y:i}He's in command of several hundred feet|between him and the road.
{130768}{130838}{Y:i}Natural rock formations shelter him|from attacks.
{130844}{130928}{Y:i}It is five hours now since Roy Earle|took to cover on the rock...
{130933}{131002}{Y:i}...and there's no indication|on his part to surrender.
{131007}{131094}{Y:i}The mountain road is jammed.|Spectators are coming from all over.
{131099}{131149}{Y:i}The scene is 60 miles|from Ballard.
{131154}{131223}I must go back the way we came.|Is there another soon?
{131228}{131303}Yes, there's one that leaves|from here in about 10 minutes.
{131321}{131408}Just like all dames. She don't know|whether she's coming or going.
{131448}{131504}It's infernally cold up here.|Maybe it's nerves.
{131509}{131593}The rock above, where Earle is hiding,|looks like a huge iceberg.
{131598}{131668}Whenever the flares are lit,|the faces of the crowd...
{131672}{131766}...look like white masks of snow.|They look dead, all but their eyes.
{131771}{131830}{Y:i}- Where you going?|- I'm Healy, of the Bulletin.
{131835}{131883}Let's see your police card.
{131904}{131943}Okay.
{131949}{132020}There have been rumors.|One is, Earle's about to give up.
{132025}{132137}{Y:i}Another, they've sent for Army|bombing planes to blast Earle out.
{132142}{132222}{Y:i}And the sheriff and his men|hold conference after conference.
{132227}{132320}{Y:i}Nerves of everyone are getting taut.|The crowd is getting very restless.
{132325}{132418}{Y:i}Spotlights are on Earle's fortress.|They're planning something new.
{132424}{132476}- Howdy, sheriff.|- Hello, Charley.
{132493}{132532}- Hey, Slim?|- Yeah?
{132537}{132589}- See that peak up there?|- Yeah.
{132594}{132688}Reckon you could work your way|up above where that fella's hiding?
{132694}{132746}Ain't never been done before.
{132751}{132827}It's a straight 1000 feet.|I don't know.
{132832}{132882}I'll take a try at it.
{132888}{132975}There's the sheriff talking with a man|with a queer-looking rifle.
{132980}{133055}Any minute now, it may be curtains|for Roy Earle.
{133061}{133137}This seems to be the coldest place|in the world tonight.
{133142}{133206}One is awe-stricken|by this rendezvous with death.
{133210}{133278}The onlookers standing by|as if they watched a game.
{133283}{133375}The tall pine trees,|clustered around like a silent jury.
{133381}{133466}Officers waiting for the kill,|and up above, a defiant gangster...
{133471}{133558}...from a simple farm on the flats|of Indiana, about to be killed...
{133563}{133633}...on the highest mountain peak|in the United States.
{133694}{133758}What's the idea, you?|Get back where you belong!
{133763}{133829}Anybody else tries that will|get run in! See?
{133997}{134083}What are you up to?|Why'd you try to get through this line?
{134088}{134195}What'd you mean to do?|Have you a little dog in that basket?
{134199}{134270}A little, gray-white dog?
{134356}{134395}Boy!
{134400}{134439}Hey!
{134477}{134571}- What's the matter with her?|- Roy Earle's been traveling with a Marie.
{134576}{134659}- Sure, I know. What about it?|- Meet Marie.
{134664}{134770}Hey, sheriff!|Sheriff!
{135140}{135201}I guess Slim couldn't make it.
{135377}{135457}Listen, you. For the last time,|I'm telling you to call Earle.
{135462}{135530}- Lf you don't get wise, I'm gonna...|- Wait a minute.
{135535}{135623}Look, Marie. It's dawn now,|and we can't wait any longer.
{135628}{135689}We don't wanna kill your man|unless we have to.
{135695}{135780}Why don't you tell him to come down|and surrender peaceably.
{135785}{135857}You know, if you help us now,|it'll go easier with you.
{135862}{135946}- I'm not thinking of myself.|- Be smart.
{135951}{136038}Just yell up to him and tell him to put|his gun away and come down.
{136043}{136102}Otherwise, we'll get him, sure.
{136220}{136255}All right.
{136408}{136451}Go ahead and yell.
{136507}{136542}- No, I won't!|- What's that?
{136546}{136589}- I won't!|- We'll get him, then!
{136593}{136683}He's gonna die anyway. He'd rather it|was this way! Go on, kill him!
{136688}{136734}Kill him!|Kill him!
{136778}{136844}Okay, lady, we're through.
{136918}{137000}Earle! Come down!|It's your last chance!
{137005}{137084}Come and get me,|there's plenty of you down there!
{137130}{137179}I'm telling you,|it's your last chance!
{137185}{137238}That's what you say, copper!
{139022}{139061}Marie!
{139123}{139162}Marie!
{139257}{139282}Marie!
{139424}{139468}Marie!
{140586}{140638}Big-shot Earle.
{140648}{140687}Well, well.
{140719}{140770}Look at him lying there.
{140779}{140831}He ain't much now, is he?
{140976}{141015}Mister.
{141057}{141112}What does it mean...
{141127}{141175}...when a man...
{141180}{141264}...crashes out?|- Crashes out?
{141279}{141358}That's a funny question|for you to ask now, sister.
{141375}{141423}It means he's free.
{141597}{141636}Free?
- Have you got it?
- I think so, yes, I think so.
Weber, my notebook.
- What's the matter?
- I thought I heard someone outside.
- He's always hearing things since he got that message.
- What message?
- A message I do not quite understand.
- From whom?
- That's just it, I don't know.
- But you think it's from this mysterious rescuer, huh?
- I believe it came from him, yes.
I believe I shall be got safely away.
I wouldn't be the first, you know.
- And you'll go on with your work somewhere else, out of reach of the Nazis?
- Of course.
- You've always refused to work for them, haven't you?
- I would sooner die.
My business is to cure, not to kill.
Weber, you say you gave the last injection at 4 o'clock?
- Yes.
Greatly increased resistance.
They were definitely better.
Seems to be working.
There is a man outside.
He told me to give you this note.
- Let me read it.
- Thank you.
- The mind of man is bounded only by the universe?
What's that mean?
- I knew it.
Weber, get my hat and coat, quickly.
And bring my suitcase.
Notebook.
- Please be careful, please be careful.
- What have I to lose?
- Good luck, my friend.
In my newspaper, Freedom,
I shall tell proudly of a German whose brains could not be bought.
- Thank you.
But I should not advise you to.
- Oh, I am quite safe, I am a Pole.
My country is not at war.
Yet.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- And Weber, see that they get better.
I am ready.
- Hurry, hurry.
- I think he will be all right.
- Dr. Benckendorf?
- He has gone away.
- That car that just left, follow it.
- You are wasting your time.
- Sidimir Koslowski, isn't it?
Our time isn't entirely wasted.
You saved us a journey.
Inside.
- Get this, it's hot, another big escape,
Justin Prolov.
- Now, hold it, now hold it--
- No, no nobody knows he who he is.
- Gentlemen, please, gentlemen.
The Minister of Propaganda instructs me to inform all foreign correspondents that rumors of a mysterious personage helping enemies of the state to escape from Germany are without foundation.
We can assure you there have been no such escapes.
And there is no such rescuer.
Furthermore, in Nazi
Germany, no one can hope to be saved by anybody!
- Jordan!
Jordan.
- Yes, sir?
- Jordan, you are nothing better than a vandal.
A Goth, a spiritual descendant of the Huns, whose primary object was the desecration of beauty.
- I wouldn't know what you mean, sir.
Not without a dictionary.
- Yours is the unique privilege of looking after the fairest goddess of them all.
The one sublime woman.
But how do you treat her?
Look, man.
Look.
- Sorry, sir.
As a matter of fact, I'm very fond of Aphrodite, very fond.
But there's so many of 'em.
- So many of 'em?
- Well, in a manner of speaking, there are, aren't there, sir?
- There's only one woman like this.
Look at the symmetry, look at the grace, look at, look at the dust, Jordan.
- Sorry, sir,
I'll go and get my feather duster right away, sir.
- Fond of her?
- Look, girls, there's Juno.
- No, madam, not Juno.
Aphrodite Kallipygos.
- Are you sure?
- Well I ought to know, I discovered her.
- Really?
She's just come out of her bath.
And you see that towel she's holding in her hand--
- That is not a towel, madam, it is a heton, a form of drapery.
- It looks like a towel.
- Very good.
It's a towel to you, it's a heton to me.
- She's the goddess of plenty--
- No, no, no, no, the goddess of love.
- Sh.
- Of lawful, wedded love.
- She's a respectable goddess, girls.
- She's practically perfect, as you can see.
And in the languishing eye and smiling lips, there is a boundless compassion for the folly and ignorance of a blind world.
- Very jolly.
Yes, very jolly.
Come along girls.
- Professor, the college porter just called for you, sir.
You're late.
- Late for what?
- Your lecture, sir.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous, my lecture isn't till Friday.
- But today is Friday, sir.
- Good heavens, how extraordinary.
What happened to Thursday?
- We had it yesterday, sir.
- Did we?
Did we.
- Yes, sir.
- Morning.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Where's teacher?
- If he doesn't hurry, the lecture will be over before it starts.
- Well I've sent the porter to rout him out.
- Half an hour's nothing.
He didn't turn up at all last week.
- Hey, look at that, boy, isn't that beautiful?
- I think it's insulting, being so late.
- Well, what do you expect, Bibbi, archeologists are always a thousand years behind the times.
- No, Mr. Maxwell, a mere matter of 35 minutes.
Which compels me to omit two thirds of my lecture, for which, no doubt, you'll be duly grateful.
I shall therefore content myself with merely giving you something to think about till our next meeting.
The constitution of ancient Greece bears witness to both practical and spiritual influences.
For example, every line of the Parthenon, either returns to mother Earth, or slopes gently upwards to the heavens.
What is that?
- That, sir?
That's a dice.
- Dice?
What's it doing here?
- It, uh, showed a regrettable tendency to return to mother Earth.
- You'd better remove it.
- Yes, sir.
- Give it to me.
Mr. Maxwell, I often wonder what persuaded you to join this class.
- My old man figured that a course of archeology'd sober me.
- He figured in vain.
- Anyhow, he was crazy, my coming to England.
- That I can well understand.
But to continue.
- Uh, professor.
Could I have my dice, sir?
- To continue.
In the Parthenon, we see the working of the spiritual influence, while in the dwelling houses of the Greeks we find the practical, as emphasized by a strict division of the women's quarters from the men's.
An arrangement which in my view proves the vast superiority of Greek civilization over our own.
- He's always making cracks at us.
- Greek women, moreover, were condemned to habitual seclusion.
An admirable practice, which unfortunately is not followed in this university.
- Do you object to our presence here, professor?
- Oh, I can't object.
I can merely deplore it.
Now that we've succeeded, somewhat elaborately, in getting rid of the female students,
I'd like to have a word with you.
For some time past, I've been making excavations in Central Europe, for the purpose of discovering traces of an Aryan civilization.
Oh, I'm perfectly serious, gentlemen.
It may surprise you to learn the German government is most interested in the idea.
Next week, the term comes to an end.
Yes, Mr. Maxwell, it comes to an end.
And in the vacation, I've decided that I might take a few archeology students with me.
How does the idea appeal to you?
- It appeals enormously to me, sir.
- And me, sir.
- I'd like to come, sir.
- So would I, sir.
If the financial requirements can be kept within reasonable limits.
- I think I can guarantee that, Mr. Mclntyre.
That's four.
Four.
Not a very flattering response.
- Would I be allowed to bring my young sister, sir?
- No, Mr. Elsted,
I'm seeking to avoid the company of females in general, and young sisters in particular.
I assume you would not be interested, Mr. Maxwell.
- No, sir, I spend my vacations in the present, not the past.
- Good.
Good!
- Professor, aren't we asking for trouble, going to Germany at a time like this?
- Trouble?
- I mean,
I'd like to come too, but the jolly old blue might go up at any moment, you know.
- Why, I hadn't thought of that.
A roughhouse is just my meat!
- Mr. Maxwell, I've already accepted your refusal.
- No, I take it back, prof, you can count me in.
- Oh, but I assure you--
- Now, prof, you might need a few huskies.
And I'm a whale at organization!
You say the word and I'll run the whole outfit.
- Mr. Maxwell, one of the chief attractions of this expedition, was the thought that for three whole months I wouldn't be seeing you.
However, now that's to remind me of something.
Of course, crumpets for tea.
Well, think it over, gentlemen.
Those of you who want more information can come and see me in the morning.
Good day.
- I'll be around with the whole thing scheduled after dinner.
Come on, boys.
- 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe--
- Stop!
- All mimsy were the--
- Ah, professor, good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- How are you, pray?
- Late for my crumpets, as a matter of fact, which unlike wine, do not improve with keeping.
- Good day, sir.
- Ah, one moment.
It may have escaped your memory that I am the dean of this college.
- Oh, so you are, sir, I'm so sorry.
- But you will hardly have forgotten Dr. Benckendorf.
- My goodness, the guinea pig!
- My old friend, how good it is to see you.
- Well, well, well, it must be nearly 20 years.
- All of that, I am afraid.
- Ah, this is wonderful.
How are the experiments coming along?
I tell you what, you must come round to my rooms after hall, and we'll talk the cluck around.
- May I remind you that the doctor is my guest.
- No no no, you're both of you my guests, come along.
Well, goodbye.
- Extraordinary fellow.
- Well, now that the dean has left us, tell me all about it.
The serum was a success, eh?
- I left before I had the final proof.
- Oh that was too bad.
- On the other hand, I still have my life.
- It's hard to believe conditions are as bad as you say.
- They are worse, my friend.
My escape was a miracle.
- So it seems.
- I very much regret, I am unable to thank my rescuer.
- By the way, who was he?
And how on earth did he manage it?
- I have no idea.
He came and went like a shadow.
An invisible bodyguard.
Every detail was arranged for me, from the time I left my home.
- Regular Cook's tour, eh?
Well anyway, you're safe and alive and able to get on with your work.
- Yes, I like to believe it was because of my work that he did it.
- Not a bad reason.
- [Benckendorf] It is difficult for people like us to understand the motives of a true adventurer.
You and I are not men of action, my friend.
- No, I hate violence.
It seems such a paradox to kill a man before you can persuade him what's right.
So uncivilized.
- Bless my soul, what's that?
- Everything's lined up, prof, and I brought the bunch along for a final check-up.
- I said tomorrow.
- Sure, but I'm helping you buy 12 hours.
Now look, chief, use the itinerary of the times of arrival and departure.
An iron ration will be carried by all, and personal luggage restricted to 28 pounds.
And we're all set to go.
- Go away, don't you realize that I--
- Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry, sir.
- Say, prof, can I have my bones?
- Hmm?
- Dice.
- No, they're my bones now.
- You're welcome, prof, see you in the morning.
- Good heavens.
Did I dream all that?
- I'm afraid not.
We're all set to go.
- My home is in Oy.
- Oy?
- Oy.
But when I am on duty, I am billeted at the chalet.
- Do you think he'd bite me?
- No, not unless I tell him to.
- Come here, gentlemen, I want you to meet a friend of mine from Oy.
- Hello, how are you?
- I say, professor, we're not gonna walk right on out of Germany today, are we?
- My feet are giving out.
- Do you think they'll manage to carry you another 20 hours, Mr. Gregson?
- What's all this barbed wire for?
- We are at the German-Swiss frontier, gentlemen.
And the barbed wire is to prevent the oppressed Swiss from escaping into free Germany.
- Say, do you see what I see?
- What do you mean, the cow?
- Yeah, the cow.
- Yeah, believe it or not, boys, that's a Bonhoffer cow.
- They produce less milk than our Jersey cows.
- Really, you must tell me more of your experiences some other time.
- Mr. Romley.
- Here.
- Come on, Gretchen, let's hear a few.
- Yes, come on.
♫ You'll take the high road
♫ And I'll take the low road
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye
♫ For me and my true love will never meet again
♫ On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond
- Come on, boys, Annie Lloyd.
- Everything all right, Herr Professor?
- Everything's splendid.
And the coffee's excellent.
- I'm glad it's to your taste, sir.
- Still at it, prof?
- Yes, we shall only be doing about 15 miles tomorrow.
- It'll seem like standing still.
- Well, have you got our marching orders?
- Yeah, just another 15 miles.
- Does he never relax?
- He's like a man hunted by a conscience.
Forever forging ahead.
There must be reason for it.
- There is.
Sex starvation.
- Go on.
- No kidding.
- Maybe you're right.
- Well can't we do something about it?
- Say, that's quite an idea.
Tootle on that flootle,
Jock, I'm going into action.
My tooting.
♫ La da dee, da dum dee dum
♫ La da dee, da dum da dum
♫ Dee ♫
- Now gentlemen, since you're all in such magnificent spirits,
I've decided to alter slightly tomorrow's itinerary.
- Ah.
- It will now be 20 miles.
- 20 miles, but that's--
- We'll make it 19 miles.
Yes.
Now, as you all know, we're now at Unter Sitzenberg.
Altitude 5,000 feet.
In the morning, we shall climb to 8,000 feet.
And uh... in the afternoon...
Yes.
On second thought, we'll postpone discussion about the afternoon's operations until later.
And so, gentlemen, to bed.
The call tomorrow morning is 5:30am.
- Hello.
- Hello, Hans.
Have some coffee?
- No, no, I want to go to bed.
- Now take it easy Admiral,
I never shave in the evening.
- It's getting late, Herr Professor.
- Thank you for reminding me, my friend.
♫ Goodnight ladies
♫ Goodnight ladies
♫ Goodnight ladies
♫ We draw you now ♫
- Silence.
Go to sleep.
- If you're looking for dames, there aren't enough to go around.
- Oh, wanted me, sir?
- Yes, come.
Anybody come in here just now?
- There's no one here but the English party.
- So.
- I haven't seen anyone, sir.
- Are you sure?
- Yes sir, I have been here since I came off duty.
- So.
Well he's in Switzerland by now.
There'll be the devil to pay for this!
Get your post.
- You don't expect me to believe that nonsense?
- Yes I do.
- It couldn't be the same man.
- It might be.
- It couldn't be!
Here, here, here, here, here!
He couldn't be everywhere.
- He could.
- And last night here on the Swiss frontier.
Let's go see how the reports are coming in.
- Right.
- What's the latest about Planker?
- Oh a message from Breslov.
No information regarding identity of unknown man who assisted in Karl Planker's escape.
- Still no news of this fellow.
Means trouble for someone.
Any news?
- Message from Hamburg.
No information regarding identity of unknown man who prevented the execution of Josef Fiatz.
- Breslaw, Hamburg, Belgian frontier, French frontier.
All the same, no news.
- Planker seems to have got away.
- Over the Swiss border, same as Josefs and Blumenfeld.
- Shankenhurst went through Holland.
But it's this damn shadow that Graum's after, if we can believe in it.
- Well I do.
- You call this thing a report?
What is the use, Herr
Kommandant, of the gestapo arresting enemies of the
Reich if you permit them to escape?
- Every precaution was taken.
- That's no excuse for your conduct.
- We are answerable for our conduct to General von Graum, not to his assistant.
Kindly have my report delivered.
- I'm afraid you'll regret that, Herr Kommandant.
Please wait outside.
Schmidt?
Take this report to General von Graum.
- Yes sir.
Oh, don't you think?
- At once!
- Yes sir.
Get out, you!
- Oh, Hoffman.
- Yes?
Oh, hello Schmidt.
- Take this report in there.
- What is it?
- Another report from the prison kommandant about Karl Planker's escape.
- I'm sorry, just going to have my lunch.
- Hoffman, this is an order.
- Herr Reich Minister.
- Know your enemy.
I am told that the English have a secret weapon.
Their sense of humor, and
I am determined to find out all about it.
For instance.
PG Wodehouse.
Listen.
"The man with the beard sighed.
"Down in the forest something stirred."
Is that funny?
- No, it's not funny.
- Good.
Now, the famous English humoristic journal Punch.
"Young lady at telephone.
"You say you have met an officer and a gentleman.
"Well, bring them both up."
Not funny?
- No, not funny.
- Good, now Edward Lear.
"There was an old man of Bengal
"went to a fancy dress ball.
"He said I'll risk it and go as a biscuit
"and the dog ate him up in the hall."
Very unfunny.
- Yes, very.
- Now Herr Lewis Carroll.
"Alice Through the Looking Glass.
"Twas brillig and the slithy toves
"did gyre and gimble in the wabe."
Painful rubbish.
- Very painful.
- I have come to the conclusion that the English sense of humor is a myth.
They have no sense of humor and therefore they have no secret weapon, the whole thing is a complete bluff.
- Yes, yes.
- Ah, but wait.
When I am Gauleiter of
London I shall see to it that there is no talk of sense of humor.
- Oh you will, Herr Reich Minister.
- Well what is this?
- A report on the escape of Karl Planker.
- Ah.
Schmidt and Marx, bring them here.
Get them!
I shall see the prisoner
Koslowski in three minutes.
Ah, come in gentlemen, come in.
Incompetent clowns!
You have read this report?
- I have sir, I told the prison kommandant what to expect.
- You did, eh?
- The frontiers are watched, all foreigners questioned.
It won't be long before we get the man who arranged these escapes.
- Oh, then you have his description?
- Hardly, sir.
- Well.
And it never occurred to you to question the one man who could give it to you?
- Who, sir?
- Send in Sidimir Koslowski.
- Of course.
- Just so.
A more impatient man might resent having to supply all the brains in his department.
- Prisoner Koslowski.
- Ah, just the man we want to see.
I wanted to have a little chat with you about freedom.
Oh, not the paper you edit, but your own personal freedom.
- Well?
- At our last interview I asked you to let me have a list of the persons who had contributed matter to your paper contrary to the interests of the Reich.
- You did.
- Well suppose we forget that.
- It'll save you a lot of disappointment.
- And suppose you answer me a much simpler question.
- In return for what?
- Ticket to Warsaw, the freedom of your own country.
While it exists.
- What do you want?
- A description of the man who prevented the arrest of Dr. Benckendorf.
- I can't give it.
- You were present at the time.
A trained observer must have noticed some little peculiarity.
How he walked, he talked, his height.
What was his nationality?
- I've no idea.
- Oh come.
I should hate to leave you to the tender mercies of those idiots who've just gone out.
- Very well then.
Under duress.
He was seven feet high and covered with red hair.
- I see.
You are, I believe, a married man.
- Correct.
But with Europe in its present state, my family is abroad.
- Your family consisting of one daughter?
- Yes.
She is safely in America.
- In America, yes.
Thank you.
Good day.
- Is it the real thing, sir?
- No, Master Gregson, I'm afraid it's just a flint from one of Mr. Hitler's new roads.
- Letter for you, Prof.
- Oh, thank you.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Gregson.
Well, look at that.
Oh that's very pretty.
An invitation from our embassy in Berlin.
Berlin?
Oh that seems an awful long way away.
- Wait a minute, don't tell me you've forgotten we're all set for Berlin tomorrow morning?
- Are we?
- Sure.
- What time are we leaving?
- Oh.
AM?
- AM, and I'm gonna write it down.
Now it's right here in your pocket.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Well gentlemen, I shall see you on the train.
- Two!
- Two.
- But where are you going tonight, sir?
Aren't you going to stay here?
- Probably.
Probably.
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about me.
- You know, some guys should go around in a lead.
- er kommt.
What did I tell you?
- Get rid of it, you fool!
- What are you doing you two?
- Nothing.
- You were looking at something.
- I was only looking at his hands.
- Why?
- Because they're the hands of the world's greatest pianist.
- Well, who wants to look at the dirty hands of a dirty loafer?
I shall report you for this.
Name?
- Meyer, Karl Meyer.
- Get on with your work or you'll have a taste of this.
- How do you expect to be rescued from this place?
Nothing but fields and open country.
- I don't know, but I believe.
There have been others, you know.
- Stop talking there!
Next time there's any trouble it'll be one of you scarecrows!
- Gosh, the shadow's been at it again.
World famous pianist escapes from labor camp.
- Let's have a look.
Karl Meyer the pianist is reported to have crossed the French frontier in an exhausted condition.
- It is suggested that his escape is effected by the mysterious personage believed to have been responsible for similar rescues of other enemies of the Reich.
- What a game, what a game.
- Better than burrowing like a rabbit for bits of the past.
That guy has guts.
- Even a rabbit has guts, Mr. Maxwell.
- Sounds awfully sensational.
Wonder how he does it.
- By taking a chance.
- They'll catch him on the hop one of these days.
They always catch that sort of bloke, don't they sir?
- In the deplorable argue of you moderns, I wouldn't know.
- The man penetrated the camp in the guise of a scarecrow.
- In the guise of a scarecrow?
Here let's have a look.
Guise of a scarecrow.
He was undoubtedly wounded, for a ragged coat with a blood-soaked sleeve was picked up when the escape was effected.
- Blood soaked sleeve?
Very melodramatic.
- Pipped in the arm, eh?
- I wouldn't pay too much attention to newspaper reports, gentlemen.
- Well, I suppose one can get a wash on this train.
- Yes, yes, that's a good idea.
- Think I'll have a wash too.
- Right, a wash.
- My hands are perfectly clean.
What on earth's the matter with you gentlemen?
- Prof.
- Just so, Mr. Maxwell.
But a sensible fellow would keep his mouth shut.
- Oh gee, oh boy oh boy.
Well kick me from here to Christmas.
- Apart from the wearisomeness of such an undertaking,
I'm the one who should be kicked for the not unnatural mistake of underestimating your intelligence.
- But how did you get into the racket?
- Trouble was to keep out of it.
You see, when a man holds the view that progress and civilization depend in every age upon the hands and brains of a few exceptional spirits, it's rather hard to stand by and see them destroyed.
- But how did you get away with it?
You of all people?
- Mr. Maxwell, I'm not a spectacular person.
In fact, a natural capacity for melting into the landscape has suddenly proved very useful.
- I guess you're one of the greatest guys in creation.
- That, Mr. Maxwell, is a gross overstatement.
Actually I'm a singularly weak person.
Who invariably gives way to his impulses.
- Fellas, come back here, on all fours.
- Well gentlemen, I hope you feel duly refreshed.
- Yes, thank you sir.
- Professor, may I shake you by the hand?
- Certainly Mr. Mclntyre, especially as we shall soon be saying goodbye.
- Goodbye?
- Goodbye?
- What else?
Now that you've discovered my guilty secret.
- Yes, we've got something to say about that.
- Plenty to say.
- Yes, we've been talking it over ourselves.
- Yes, we want to be in it, sir.
- We are in it, up to the neck and through to the finish!
- Oh no you're not.
- Oh yes we are, otherwise I'm afraid we'll have to give the whole show away!
Eh fellas?
- What is this gentlemen, blackmail?
- Well, a nice kind of blackmail.
- Yes.
Yes, I'll attend to it at once.
Hello?
Hello?
I can't hear a word, I'll ring you back.
Gentlemen please, I can't hear my own voice!
- I'm sorry.
- Is there nowhere else you can go to perpetrate these noises?
- Characteristics are purely French.
- Rubbish!
The phrase or one like it occurs in no fewer than seven compositions of Lubach's early work!
- Nothing like it.
- Well at least we're agreed about the tempo!
- I maintain there is a modulation in the second movement!
- But I heard the record and I didn't notice it!
- Well if you'd listened more carefully you'd have heard that the tempo of the second movement is far slower than the tempo of the third!
- Gentlemen, please.
Will you be quiet!
- Here in this building we are supposed to know everything that goes on in Germany.
You can hardly expect me to believe that these escapes were effected without treachery somewhere!
- Herr Reich Minister!
- We've given all the information we possess.
- If my loyalty's in question, I resign.
- Resign, that is your valuable contribution?
Sit down.
Now, let us examine once more the available evidence.
First, a scrap of music whistled in the night.
- Beg your pardon Herr Reich
Minister, it went this way.
- No, this way.
- No no no.
- Stop that!
The origin of the tune is being traced by a committee of experts.
Secondly, the corner of a card found in the pocket of the scarecrow's coat.
Send in Herr Zigor.
Where is it?
- Here it is.
- A piece of paste board.
Gild aged, with RSVP printed in copper plate on one side, and the figures 9:52 in pencil on the reverse.
Well?
- It must be part of an invitation card, sir.
- Oh well done Herr Schmaus.
And that being so it is possibly one of a number issued for the same reception.
Is it beyond the power of the gestapo to trace where that reception is being held?
- Herr Zigor is here.
Well?
- Unfortunately sir, none of the persons who overheard the whistling that followed each escape has enjoyed a musical education.
- Oh.
- So we have endeavored to crystallize their renderings into a single musical phrase and score it.
There.
- I asked you to trace the origins of the phrase.
- It starts with a 27 bar of the third movement of Lubach's concerto in G minor.
May I play it for you?
- No, I will.
Sit down.
Put on the record made by the frontier guard.
But don't start it.
Lubach's concerto.
I don't believe it.
Put on the record.
Oh, stop it.
Well.
Here at last we have something.
Come over here, all of you.
You see?
Identical.
- Absolutely identical.
The British Embassy reception.
That means he must be English!
- Does it?
How interesting.
And the fact that I too have received an invitation means that I must be English!
Thank you gentlemen for your invaluable help.
You may all go.
And you.
What are you doing here?
- I was just collecting some papers.
- What for?
- I don't know.
I always do.
- What's your name?
- Wagner, Herr General.
- Do you like music, Wagner?
- Not very much, Herr General.
- Do you like this melody?
- It's quite nice, for an English tune.
- Did you say English tune?
- Why of course.
An old English song.
There is a Tavern in the Town.
- Come here, Wagner.
- Herr General?
- Don't be nervous.
You shall be rewarded!
You are a genius!
You shall have a signed picture of the Fuhrer!
Have a chocolate.
- His excellency the Peruvian minister and Madam Gordia.
Lord and Lady Grabett.
- How are you my dear?
- The ambassador here?
- No no, he had to fly to London.
- Oh, things as bad as that, eh?
- Well hope springs eternal, eh?
- Herr Reich Minister General von Graum.
- My felicitations.
- So glad you were able to come.
- I never miss an opportunity of cementing the friendship between Britain and the Reich.
- That was very happily put.
- I hope you will be able to come to the Nuremberg rally?
- Yes, I hope so.
What's it in honor of this year?
- Peace.
- Ah.
- [Porter] Captain and Madam Lacroix.
Colonel and Mrs. Channing and Lady Eva Plumb.
- That man over there.
- Where?
- By the table.
The one by the fireplace with the beard.
- Idiot, that's one of our men.
- The right honorable the Earl of Meadowbrook.
- Hello Bussy, what have you been doing?
- Absolutely nothing.
- My dear fellow, you mustn't overdo it.
- I know.
- Oh, the jolly Miss Coles.
- Good evening, General.
- General von Graum.
- Oh yes, of course.
- Not a very good memory.
Nervous?
- Not in the least.
- Well you know what you're looking for?
- I have my own idea.
- A typical English guards officer, man about town.
Or perhaps the explorer type.
Strong, silent, resolute.
- Guard's officer, man about town, explorer.
- Perhaps that man there.
- Or there.
Or there.
No, I'm afraid that's not the type I'm looking for.
- No?
- No.
I'm looking for brain, not brawn.
- As you will.
Anyhow, all I can tell you is that the man we want will be here tonight.
See what you can do.
- Don't forget the General's name again.
- Thank you, sir.
- Sir Roger and Lady Tadworth.
- Your card please, sir.
Thank you.
This way please.
Thank you sir.
- His excellency the Chilean ambassador.
- Have you got a match?
- I'll get you one, sir.
- Thank you.
- Senor and Senorita Goya.
- Old soldiers.
- Yes sir.
- Sorry sir.
Professor Horatio Smith.
- Hello George.
- Hello Horace.
- Well I've come as I promised.
- Well that's splendid.
- Can I go now?
- Oh I should stay a bit and enjoy yourself.
- Alright.
- That's a nice suit.
You make it yourself?
- Certainly not, a fellow in Cambridge made it for me when I was 17.
- Alice, I'd like you to meet my brother Professor Smith.
Lady Willoughby.
- How do you do?
- Not the Professor Smith?
Why only the other day someone said I was the image of your Aphrodite.
What do you think?
- Well it's rather hard to judge, you see,
I only know my Aphrodite in the nude.
- Horace, I don't know whether these details of your private life--
- Yes well, to the pure all things impure.
- If I were you I should take things a bit easy.
- It's alright, my head's like iron.
- In more ways than one, believe me.
- Say, there's the prof.
And it looks like he wants me.
- You mean us.
- Who is that?
- I've no idea.
- He's here.
- How do you know?
I've just been upstairs and--
- Have you noticed that, sir?
- I do my best not to, Mr. Gregson.
- I'll bet she's got a headache holding that up.
- Yes, let that serve as a reminder to you gentlemen that the rendezvous is 11:30 at Dvorak's.
- And I think I know who he is.
- Oh, who?
- I don't speak until I'm certain.
- I thought you said there were half a dozen cards with their corners torn off.
- Yes, but only one that will exactly fit the one that I have here.
- I can hardly imagine the man you're looking for being wise enough to tear the corners from half a dozen and foolish enough to leave his own card.
- You are a very intelligent young woman.
- Very intelligent of you to realize it.
- Now that he's in here I can promise he won't get out.
- I haven't any complaints.
- The champagne's not too hot, in fact it's lukewarm.
- What do you expect baby?
It's free!
See Naples and die.
Boy, do you see what I see?
- Now's your chance.
- Gotta do things artistically.
There's a different approach to each type.
Watch me.
- Excuse me.
Oh, I'm so sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
- Von Graum.
- Smith.
Clearly a case of mistaken identity,
I'm looking for Jekyll and I find Hyde.
- Jekyll?
Hyde?
Oh an English joke.
- Well, hardly a joke.
- Well excuse me.
- No no no, you mustn't go, tell me more about yourself.
I'm always interested in local customs and habits.
For instance, what do you do with yourself?
- I hunt for the enemies of the Reich.
- Do you?
Do you get much shooting?
Oh waiter.
- Well excuse me, I think someone wants me.
- No no no, not til you've had your coffee.
They tell me the British
Embassy is the last place in Germany where it can be obtained.
- In Germany we have discovered that a substitute can be better than the real thing.
- Ah, the story of the grapes.
Tell me, is it a fact that in your country, there's no longer any freedom of speech?
- All lies, all lies.
Of the degenerate, plutocratic press.
- Ah, is that so?
Well then you see that journalism is so untrustworthy, isn't it?
- May I ask what brings you to Germany, Herr Smith?
- A thirst for knowledge.
I'm trying to discover whether there was or was not an Aryan civilization in this country.
- There was.
- Ah, some people say there wasn't, but I shall find out.
- Here's a whiskey, Bussy, what'll you have in it?
- Absolutely nothing.
- You know it is extraordinary.
Bussy's vocabulary consists of--
- Absolutely nothing.
- It's sublime.
- It's ridiculous.
- It can mean anything.
- And it can mean absolutely nothing.
- It can even be an insult.
- Or a password.
- Password!
- Tell me, I am curious.
Your English humorist Lewis Carroll.
Why does he write such idiocy?
Listen.
"Twas brillig and the slithy toves
"did gyre and gimble in the wabe."
Does not make sense.
- But it does!
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe.
All mimsy were the borogroves and the mome raths outgrabe.
It makes perfect sense.
- But what does it mean?
- It means whatever you want it to mean.
You can either use it lyrically or, as I'm afraid
I do sometimes, in place of swear words.
- Extraordinary.
- As a matter of fact you know ever since I've been in Germany, I've felt exactly like Alice in Wonderland.
- Oh but Germany is a Wonderland.
- Oh it is, it is.
- But we have one problem.
To be or not to be, as our great German poet said.
- German?
But that's Shakespeare.
- But you don't know.
- Well I know it's Shakespeare.
I thought Shakespeare was English.
- No no, Shakespeare is a German.
Professor Schutzbacher has proved it once and for all.
- Oh dear, how very upsetting.
Still, you must admit that the English translations are most remarkable.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, goodnight, parting is such sweet sorrow.
- What is that?
- One of the most famous lines in German literature.
- You haven't even told me your name.
- It's Ludmilla.
- What a lullaby.
Millie for short?
- No.
Lucinka.
- Ah.
- Have you noticed the music stopped?
- Oh, right back to earth again.
- Let's talk about you for a change.
Apart from being American, what are you?
- I'm a student of archaeology.
- Very funny.
- On the level.
I'm a member of the
Professor Smith expedition and proud of it.
- Smith.
Oh, the vague person I saw you talking to?
Looks as though he hated coming into the middle of a room?
- The greatest guy that ever drew breath.
- Really?
I always said one shouldn't go by appearances.
- I could tell you things about him that'd knock the legs from under you.
- You could?
Then do.
- No, I guess you'll have to take my word for it.
- Then get me a glass of champagne to make up for it.
- Sure!
- I'm certain it's him, I've just been listening to him.
- What did he say?
- Absolutely nothing.
- Then why bother me?
- But that's what he said.
- Did you want me?
- Yes.
Our friend Marx thinks that it's that fellow there.
What's your opinion?
- I wouldn't have said so.
- Oh, have you a better suggestion?
- Yes.
Yes, I would have said he was more likely.
That man by the statue.
- You can't be serious.
Why him?
- Intuition.
- That amiable fool?
I just wasted 10 minutes talking to him.
- Well, that's what I think.
- Intuition.
- Oh, hello George.
- Hello Horace.
- I say George, can I leave now?
- My dear fellow, of course.
I hope you enjoyed yourself.
- Oddly enough I did.
Quite a pleasure to be on
British territory again.
Technically.
Oh, General.
- Excuse me, I have friends.
- Of course you have, but do you know
The Walrus and the Carpenter?
Evidently not.
- In America they'd regard
German propaganda stories as jokes.
- They are mistaken.
In Germany we never joke.
Oh here's that terrible fellow who's been haunting me all evening.
He's followed me about like a shadow.
Excuse me.
Well, what do you want now?
- I want to arrest that man.
- Who?
- The man they call Bussy, the Earl of Meadowbrook.
- Here?
In the British Embassy?
Don't be a fool.
- All the same I want.
- What are you doing with those?
- Absolutely nothing.
- Lovely trees.
- A midsummer night's dream.
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- It's quite alright.
Now I know a balcony where there isn't so much traffic.
- I find it quite pleasant here.
- I've been looking for you all over the place.
Professor's just leaving.
- He would.
- Well oughtn't we to be going too?
- Scram, will you?
- My instructions are that I am not to let you out of my sight.
- Have a heart, please.
Stick around someplace.
- Alright, I'll wait for you on the staircase.
- Another party?
- Oh, just getting together with the rest of the gang at a beer cellar.
- Of course there wouldn't be any balconies at a beer cellar.
- Well, no.
That is, it'd be swell of you to come, but it's just a dump, I don't think you'd like it.
- I bet it couldn't be any worse than Smokey Joe's on 6th Avenue.
- Say, do you know Smokey Joe's?
- Yes.
Don't let it go any further.
- Come on, this has gotta be another party.
- Can I take your hat, sir?
- Thank you.
- Well well well well, still at liberty and they say the age of miracles is past.
- Well, you've put on weight, Dvorak.
What's the news?
- Democratic league's in trouble.
- What, again?
- And they've arrested their
Polish editor Koslowski.
- Oh, those hotheads.
- Ah, Koslowski's a great man.
- Yes, I know, but I'm not interested in politics.
- I know, but you should be.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, sir.
What was the party like, sir?
- It was very instructive, Mr. Spencer.
- What'll you have?
- I think I'll have a pilsner.
- Yes sir.
- Who was that?
New waiter?
- Yes he used to be in the telephone service.
- Really?
- He was dismissed, little trouble with an SS man.
- Oh yes.
- Excuse me.
- All ready for tonight, sir.
- Shh, not so loud, might be a microphone hidden under the table.
- You don't mean?
- No, Mr. Elstead, I don't mean.
We are perfectly safe here.
- Look what's just come in.
- And I wasn't allowed to bring my sister.
- Who's the girl?
- I'm sorry professor,
I did my best, but--
- But someone else did better.
I understand.
- Hi, allow me to present Professor Smith.
Prof, this is Ludmilla.
A poem from little old New York.
- How do you do?
I'd no idea you were so interested in modern poetry,
Mr. Maxwell.
Won't you sit down?
- Yes, I'd like to--
- No, thank you very much Prof.
See you presently.
- Well gentlemen, I regret you were unnecessarily called to this rendezvous.
- Nothing doing tonight, sir?
- On account of Mr. Maxwell's regrettable preoccupation with American poetry, there will be nothing doing tonight.
But we meet at the excavations tomorrow.
You can have my beer.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight Prof.
- After route over the Alps, where did you go then?
No no, I'm very interested.
- Well, I'll tell you, see--
- Forgive me for interrupting, but haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Sure, tonight at the Embassy.
- Of course, how silly of me.
- Well Prof if you'll excuse us we're gonna dance.
- We've done quite enough dancing for one night.
- Oh you should've seen her.
Why she's as light on her feet as a butterfly on a daffodil.
- Not a very happy simile.
When daffodils are in season, butterflies are mere grubs.
- Oh, Prof, that's hardly complimentary.
- But scientifically accurate.
As I rather expected the professor would be.
- Thank you.
- Could you be an angel and get my handbag?
I must have left it in the car.
- Well I--
- Please?
- Okay.
- Well.
We seem to be alone.
- So we do.
Your friend's been telling me all sorts of flattering things about you.
- Has he?
I hope you didn't believe them.
- Well, I prefer to judge for myself.
- Oh, then I must be on my best behavior.
I should hate you to leave here with the wrong impression.
- I should hate to leave with the wrong impression.
- Naturally, naturally.
- Who's the girl?
- I don't know who she is, he wouldn't come away without her.
- But you were with her all evening?
- But I don't know who she is.
- I looked everywhere, it isn't there.
- What isn't there?
- Her handbag.
- But it's here.
It's been there all the time.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- What a very strange man.
- A swell guy.
But vague.
- I wouldn't have said vague.
- What, going already Professor?
- Dvorak, you see my impulsive young American friend over there?
- I see him.
- You see the mysterious young woman with him?
- I see her.
- Be a good fellow and investigate.
- What do you think?
- I don't think anything but I'd like to know.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Professor.
- Thank you, sir.
- I think you've made a mistake, this is my room.
Aren't you being rather unwise?
- I want to talk to you.
- I dare say you do but this is neither the time nor the place.
- Don't worry, no one saw me come into the room.
- Then let's hope no one sees you go out.
Goodnight.
- No.
You've got to listen to me.
I am rather desperate and I do need your help.
You may not believe a word
I say, but before I leave this room you will believe.
- Now my dear young lady, I do wish you--
- No no please don't say anything until you've heard me.
Do you know of a Polish paper called Freedom?
- I am familiar with it, yes.
- Have you heard of its editor, Sidimir Koslowski?
- Yes.
- Some weeks ago he came to Berlin for material.
He was arrested.
- Yes, he would be.
- They put him in a concentration camp.
- They would.
- He happens to be my father.
- Hmm.
- I received a cable in
New York which I believed was from him, begging me to come at once.
It wasn't from him, it was from the gestapo.
They had been trying to force him to give the names of his journal associates, but he wouldn't speak.
Nothing they could do would make him speak.
So they hit on the idea of getting me over to persuade him.
- And did you?
- You don't know my father.
He's fearless, unshakable.
No two people were ever closer than he and I.
He filled my life with love and tenderness.
He's wonderful.
That's why I don't care what
I do to earn his freedom.
There's nothing, nobody I wouldn't sacrifice for that.
I think he's worth it.
- He must be.
- He is.
So I made a bargain with Graum.
He promised to let my father go if I helped him find the man who has been responsible for all these escapes.
- And have you?
- Yes.
But I don't want to be forced to give him away.
- Why not?
- Because I admire what he's doing.
- Why are you telling me all this?
- You are that man.
- What dreadful nonsense you do talk.
- I guessed it the moment I saw you, and the admiration of that boy David convinced me.
You and your party were near the frontier post when Karl Planker escaped.
Your diggings were only a few miles from the concentration camp where a scarecrow came to life.
You are that man, I know it.
Aren't you?
Tell me.
- Well won't that be enough for tonight?
- Tell me.
- I know you're quite harmless but please, please go.
- Before I go, you've got to choose.
Either you help my father to escape or I go straight to the gestapo and tell them what I know.
- Very well, go there quickly.
I hope they'll prove less skeptical than I.
What on earth are you crying for?
What have I done?
You brought this all on yourself.
I didn't ask you to come here.
I am horrified at the idea of a strange woman in my rooms, and a woman in tears at that.
Or are they tears?
Yes, they are.
Well they don't have any effect on me, believe me.
Here, mop 'em up with that, you look awful.
And don't you try any more fairy tales with me.
Here, you've forgotten your--
Have you noticed a delightful smell everywhere this morning?
- You mean the egg?
- Everything smells delightful to me, but of course you wouldn't understand that, Mr. Maxwell.
- You're sure you feel alright, Prof?
- I feel splendid, thank you.
Now Dvorak, tell me, why are you here so early in the morning?
- You asked me to get you some information about a certain young lady.
- So I did.
- Well I've got it.
In the first place her name isn't Coles at all, it's Koslowski.
In the second place, she's--
- Don't tell me any more.
Now I feel even better.
- What is all this?
Trailing a girl with whom
I've a luncheon date.
- Have you?
- Sure.
- Good.
That'll save me a telephone call.
- Prof, I don't get it.
- Exactly.
You made the same mistake I did.
The trouble with us, Mr. Maxwell, is that we don't understand women.
We've even forgotten they use powder on their faces.
- Monsieur.
Can I help you?
- Are you French?
- Yes.
- You're not German?
- No, I'm still French.
This is a French shop, you see.
- A French oasis in a German desert.
- What can I do for you, monsieur?
- Oh yes, yes.
Powder.
- Powder?
- Powder, yes, I'd like some powder.
- Certainly, but what kind of powder.
Bath, tooth, talcum?
Face?
- Face, face.
- Any special make?
- I beg your pardon?
- Which make would you prefer?
- Well I, what would you suggest?
- I always use Dory.
- Do you?
- Always.
- I'll have some of that.
- You won't regret it.
What shade?
- Well what shades have you got?
- (Speaking French)
- I'm afraid all that's rather beyond me.
I'll be back tomorrow.
- Monsieur.
What is she like?
- Well, I really don't quite remember, she's sort of--
- What's her coloring?
- Dark.
- I know what you want.
You take this.
- I'll have a pound of that.
- A pound?
That will last a lifetime.
This is the biggest box I've got.
- Alright, I'll have two of those.
- Two?
Very well.
- Don't bother to wrap it up, I'll just take it the way it is.
Thank you.
How much is that?
- That will be 42 marks, monsieur.
- 42 marks.
- Thank you.
Will you allow me?
- Born in France?
- Born in France.
- It's remarkable.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Hello Prof, been to a wedding?
- Good morning Mr. Maxwell.
Good morning.
I hope you'll forgive me for having invited myself to luncheon.
- Certainly fine that you are here.
- Yours, I believe.
- What's this?
- Your handbag.
- Thank you.
- Yes I would have run after you last night but unfortunately everything fell and scattered all over the place.
- I reached home before I realized I had left it behind.
- Say, when did all this happen?
- As a matter of fact your powder was spilt too and I bought you some to make up for it.
- Needn't have bothered.
- Oh it was no bother at all, there.
- Oh, my favorite shade.
How did you know?
- Intuition.
- What's going on?
First you're darn rude to each other and now look at this.
- Well now to business, where's the menu?
By the way, whose luncheon is this?
- Mine.
- No it's not, it's mine.
- So's the bill.
- Mr. Maxwell, if you heard that a very remarkable man had been imprisoned by the Nazis, what would you do?
- My damndest to get him out.
- Isn't that amazing?
Every now and then he and I have exactly the same idea.
- Could I have some water please?
- Certainly not.
Dvorak!
Some champagne.
- What kind of champagne?
- Oh, dash it, I've had this conversation before.
Any kind.
Raschel. Natural.
The best you have, only hurry.
- I don't know what to say to you.
Can't quite believe it's true.
- Suppose we have some nice cold trout to start with.
And we'll follow that with--
- I don't even know where they've taken him.
No one knows except the gestapo.
- He's at Grosberg.
What's this?
Milk-fed lamb cooked in creme de menthe?
The things they think of.
- She's being watched every minute.
There's the report.
- Went up to his room.
Enterprising.
- In my opinion she's wasting her time.
- Yes, the question is is she wasting ours?
This idiotic archaeologist.
Lunch lasted two hours, conversation appeared friendly and animated, he presented her with a box of powder.
How gallant.
How helpful love is.
I don't know what the gestapo would do without it.
This is all nonsense.
Alright, show her in.
Ah, good day Miss Coles.
Sit down.
You're looking very radiant, it must be love.
- I'm afraid not, even though
I did go to his room last night.
- Room, whose room?
- The professor's.
Didn't you know?
As a new recruit I made sure I would be followed.
- Quite so.
But we like to get our news at first hand.
- Very well, here it is at first hand.
You were right and I was wrong.
That professor's crazy, and so was I to think that he's your famous rescuer.
- So much for your intuition, eh?
- I made a mistake, and I'm afraid I made rather a fool of myself.
- Well, Rome wasn't built in a day, even by Mussolini.
And secret agents aren't made in a night.
You did your best.
- And our bargain still stands?
- Oh but of course.
I've given you my word as a party member, isn't that enough?
- More than enough.
- You shall have another assignment.
There are several persons I suspect.
- You are very kind.
Be kinder still and tell me something.
How is my father?
- Well I'll find out for you.
Let me see, he's at--
- At Grosberg.
- Of course.
Bring in the Koslowski file.
Would you like to see your father?
- More than anything.
You don't mean it, that wasn't in our bargain.
- I wanted to give you a little encouragement.
- I'd be so grateful if you would.
- Thank you.
Hmm.
He appears to be in excellent health.
- Is he?
- Oh, a transfer order.
He's being moved to a more comfortable camp.
- Will I be able to see him there?
- Well I don't see why not.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Alright.
I'll be over straight away.
Excuse me, I'll be back in a moment.
Well my dear young lady,
I'm very busy at the moment but I'll be sending for you again shortly, and I hope you and your father will be together again very soon.
Goodbye.
- Thank you, goodbye.
- Marx!
I didn't believe her Marx,
I didn't believe her, but I do now.
That idiotic archaeologist.
- Sir?
- But we've got to have proof.
- But we've absolutely nothing against him.
- You'll see my dear fellow, you'll see.
- Now if you'd said the
Earl of Meadowbrook--
- On Saturday morning I've got a job for you at Grosberg.
And in the afternoon I shall be there myself.
To be in at the kill as the English say.
Have a chocolate.
- I found out something.
Something which might be of use to you, look I made a note of it.
My father's being transferred from Grosberg to Riesenfelt on Saturday afternoon with four other men.
- Who are they?
- Schulman, Fleck.
- Gruber and Holstein, that makes five altogether.
- Yes, how did you know?
- Nevermind, go on.
- They're leaving Grosberg by car at 4:30 and arriving at Risenfelt at about 6.
- Now we're getting someplace.
Wouldn't that be our chance, Prof?
Saturday afternoon?
- Possibly, yes.
- Say, this is terrific.
Where are those maps?
Do you mind if I try to work this out, Prof?
- Not at all.
- Thanks.
Now here's Riesenfelt and here's Grosberg.
That's about 60 miles, say 45 miles per hour starting 4:30.
Now we're parked on this road here somewhere.
- Look, there's a road at the bottom of the hill there.
- Yeah, they'll be going through that wood about 5:15.
- Yes, we can get a tree across the road there, that ought to hold them up for long enough.
- Yeah, then we can scoot down this side road here and catch the main road to Berlin here!
How's that, Prof?
- Sounds alright.
- Why surprise is the principal element, surprise.
- If only you could do something.
- Don't worry, we will.
- Well, if I can't be of any more use to you,
I'll leave you, my taxi's ticking away.
- Goodbye.
Thank you for coming, you've done very well.
- Goodbye.
- I'll show you the way.
- Say, where's she going?
- It's too late, you missed your chance.
- Say how's that for the plan, Prof?
- What plan?
- The plan of the escape.
- Gentlemen, Mr. Maxwell was serious about this plan!
- But we'll never get another chance like this.
- Possibly that's exactly what the gestapo wanted you to think.
- Those guys gotta be saved.
Something's gotta be done Saturday.
- On the contrary, if we do anything it'll be on Friday.
- Friday?
- But you said Saturday was the day--
- Look Prof what I found.
Is it any use?
- Any use?
This is remarkable.
- Say listen Prof, my plan!
- 1000 BC, I should think.
Never dreamt at anything like this here.
Wait til Oxford University hear about this, they'll be green with envy.
- My plan, Prof!
- Oh, this is astonishing, really astonishing.
Thank you Mr. Elstead, thank you.
- 48 hours and he hasn't uttered a word.
- Do you think he's thought of anything?
- Let's ask him.
Say Prof, I hate to interrupt the seance, but have you thought of anything yet?
- Thought of anything?
- That guy Koslowski's gotta be rescued!
- Oh yes, of course.
That guy Koslowski's gotta be rescued on Friday, and four other guys with him.
- What, all five of them?
- Well of course.
- Jeepers creepers.
- As a matter of fact I have thought of something.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Have any of you gentlemen ever considered journalism as a profession?
- Hey, listen--
- No no no no, you listen.
- I'm getting them now.
Alright, here they are.
I've tapped the private line.
- Go to it, fellow.
- Propaganda Ministry?
Gestapo headquarters speaking.
Department X2.
About those six American journalists.
We are permitting their visit to Grosberg.
The journalists who wish to accompany Herr Voldenschatz.
Your representative of the Bund.
What do you mean you don't know?
Then find out.
- Hey, take it easy there.
- Heil Hitler.
- You wish to see?
- I've seen.
Heil Hitler.
- No visitors except by appointment.
- How long have you been here?
You don't know me?
Ever heard of the American department?
- Yes sir, I thought--
- Don't apologize, see if you can find my umbrella,
I left it behind the other day.
Voldenschatz is the name.
- Excuse me.
- Well, just the man I wanted to see.
You don't recognize me, but I remember you.
I heard Dr. Goebbels say some very nice things about you.
- So?
- So keep it to yourself.
How's the baby?
- We're getting married at the end of the month.
- So.
Now, how 'bout the six
American journalists?
- What about them?
- I'm asking you.
You don't know anything about it, get me someone who does.
- Perhaps Herr Gravitz would know.
- Gravitz should know.
Now look here Herr Gravitz.
- Do you know anything of six American journalists?
- No.
Yes, Smeltz was just asking me.
There was a message from the gestapo.
- Who's the head of the department?
- Oh, Herr Steinhof, but he wouldn't know.
- We'll see.
- Here!
- Now look here, Stelnhof, where are the permits for the six American journalists?
- Permits?
- Yes.
Don't you say heil Hitler anymore?
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
- I don't think I know you.
- What do you know?
Have you ever heard of America?
- Yes.
- Good, then where are the permits?
- But I--
- Now listen.
I'm Voldenschatz.
The man who got the Nazi party those nice headlines in America where they don't like you.
I'm the man who put the Nazi
American bund on the map, and you've never even heard of me.
Let this be a lesson to you, gentlemen.
- But--
- No no no, let me speak.
I've come all the way from New York to correct your blunders with the American correspondents.
I spent two whole weeks with them, trying to nurse them into a better humor.
This afternoon I was taking them to the Grosberg camp so they could cable the
United States and tell them not to believe those stories they hear about the German concentration camps, and you've got to spoil everything.
I asked for permits and you haven't got any permits.
- No one told me anything about this.
- The gestapo did telephone.
- Oh, so now you're deliberately obstructing the gestapo?
- That'd be the last thing I'd do.
Perhaps if you came back tomorrow--
- Tomorrow?
Do you want me to keep the representatives of six of the biggest newspapers in America waiting outside this building until tomorrow?
Unless I get those permits in two minutes, you'll be responsible.
- I'll be responsible?
- Right!
I know what I'll do.
Get me Dr. Goebbels.
- No, no, Herr Voldenschift, shaft.
I'll find the permits.
- Well find them, find them.
- There are some here, sir.
- That's better, now you can fill them up as we go.
- As we go?
- Certainly, didn't I say?
You're coming with us.
- No no, I have work to do here.
- Oh, this is too much, please, get me Dr. Goebbels.
- No no no, I can finish the work at home.
- That's right, we've been waiting long enough, come along.
Come along.
You know, the trouble with you propaganda boys, you get so used to telling lies, you don't recognize the truth when you hear it.
- Well orders are orders.
- Hmm.
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
- You know Gravitz, you're a smart boy.
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes, you can do something for me.
Ring up the Grosberg camp and tell them we're on the way.
Have them prepare everything in the usual
Ministry of Propaganda style.
And remember, America is a soft-hearted democracy.
You get me?
- Leave that to me, Herr Voldenschatz.
- Your umbrella, sir.
- Oh, umbrella.
Thank you.
Dirty boots.
- The journalists are just arriving,
Herr Kommandant.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
- I'm Steinhof of the
Ministry of Propaganda.
This is Herr Voldenschatz from Nazi American bund.
- I am honored.
- Heil Hitler.
Allow me to present to you the Chicago Tribune,
Baltimore Sun, New York Herald
Tribune, Boston Transcript,
Philadelphia Public Ledger, and the Scripps Howard Syndicate.
350 newspapers throughout
America, colossal.
- I beg your pardon, I love accuracy.
- Welcome, gentlemen.
Let me show you around our little camp.
You will see how happy everybody is.
- Come on, do your propaganda stuff.
You can talk, can't you?
- You see gentlemen, there is plenty of food.
Eggs, vegetables, bread, butter, jam, and fruit.
- Real fruit.
- Atten Hut!
Is everybody happy?
- Yes sir.
- Everybody's happy.
The eggs were fresh for breakfast?
- Yes, Herr Kommandant.
- The eggs were fresh.
- For breakfast.
- Good.
In this hut, we have some men who were stupid enough to insult our beloved Fuhrer.
The editor of an anarchist Polish paper, and four misguided German contributors.
Hut!
- Well, I'm glad you've all learnt the truth.
In America they have the idiotic idea that German concentration camps are full of unhappy people.
And the truth is the
American people only pretend to be democratic.
At heart they are 100% national socialists.
I thank you.
Heil Hitler.
Well, goodbye Voldenschatz.
You were the quintessence of all the most objectionable men
I ever met, but you served a noble purpose.
- I don't often lose my nerve, but can't we get on?
- Alright, he's just coming.
He's just been to telephone to make sure it's clear for you to go to your destination.
- Ah.
- All fixed.
- Halt, left turn!
All ready for visiting rounds, sir?
- I'm ready, carry on Sergeant.
- Left turn, march!
Visiting rounds.
Get up.
- What are they doing down there?
Stir them up, Sergeant.
- Get up!
It's the Herr Kommandant!
- Herr Kommandant?
Bring that light a bit closer.
What's happened, sir?
He's unconscious.
Someone must have hit him on the head.
Herr Kommandant.
Herr Kommandant.
Why didn't you know about this, you fool?
- Oh gee.
Oh boy.
My head's like the inside of a beehive.
Talk about pile drivers.
Woo.
- What's happened?
- Journalist slugged by guerrillas!
American flag insulted!
Where's that phony Voldenschatz?
He started it!
- Alarm bell!
Turn out the guard.
Telephone Berlin!
Gentlemen, my apologies,
I don't understand.
I'll get you a car to take you to Berlin.
- Voldenschatz!
- Ah, you oughta be pasted to the wall.
Here, snap out of it fellas and get into these pants.
- The gentleman, who could forsee it?
The gestapo telephoned!
- Ah, you give me five minutes with a trans Atlantic telephone and there won't be gestapo.
- Gentlemen, I apologize.
- Ah, save it!
- How could a simple sort of man like myself imagine that instead of attempting to rescue your father
Tomorrow as I expected you to do after you had so carefully examined my papers, you would rescue him today?
- What do you mean?
What do you mean?
- Your acting is very clever, but I'm getting a little bored with it.
Your accomplice may have rescued your father, but please remember that you are still here.
- My father's escaped?
- Yes, astounding, isn't it?
- Herr Reich Minister, Steinhof is here.
- Bring him in.
Take her in there.
Good evening.
And you are the man who has just been bluffed by this obvious hoax?
- The gestapo must hold itself responsible.
- For what?
For the incompetence and stupidity of the
Ministry of Propaganda?
Voldenschatz.
Couldn't any of you have checked up on his story?
- We are not policemen.
- Unfortunately.
Would you recognize the man if you saw him again?
- I have an excellent memory for faces, thank you.
- I may give you an opportunity to prove it before long.
Marx!
Ah, Marx, that archaeologist.
- Professor Smith?
- Yes, Professor Smith, I want to see him here at once.
Bring him!
- But he's--
- Do you want me?
Did you want to see me?
- Yes.
- That's odd, because I wanted to see you.
- Come in here.
- Thank you.
I'm so lad to find you're not busy because
I've been doing a little research work.
- That's just what I wanted to do.
- On the identity of Shakespeare.
- I'd like to know how you spent this afternoon?
- What's the matter with you?
You seem upset.
I spent the afternoon at the library at the Embassy.
Now this, this proves conclusively that Shakespeare wasn't really Shakespeare at all.
- No?
- No.
He was the Earl of Oxford.
Now you can't pretend that the Earl of Oxford was a German, can you?
Now, can you?
- No, no.
- Well, there you are.
- Herr General, how much longer am I to stand here?
Have you anything to say to me?
- Please, we have a visitor.
I think you have met Professor Smith.
- No, good day.
Goodbye.
- But you have met Herr Voldenschatz.
- Voldenschatz?
Do you know Voldenschatz?
- No.
Should I?
- Bah.
Anyway, I didn't come here to discuss Shakespeare.
If you want me, you know where I am.
- The Earl of Oxford was a very bright Elizabethan light, but this book will tell you he was a good deal more than that.
- I owe you an apology, Professor.
Can you spare me a few moments longer?
- With pleasure.
- Here's somebody who will recognize you.
Come in, Miss Coles.
- Ah.
The young lady who asks questions.
- But doesn't answer them.
Professor Smith.
That was a remarkable affair this afternoon.
- Oh, have I missed something?
- Five prisoners escaped from Grosberg.
- Oh splendid, splendid.
Oh, I beg your pardon, how annoying for you.
- By a strange coincidence,
Miss Coles' father was among them.
- Well, congratulations Miss Coles.
- Just so.
A few days ago this young lady called here and obtained some secret information.
She then went straight to your excavations.
- Well why not?
We welcome visitors.
You must come one day.
- [Graum] Do you deny having received that information?
- Really, General von Graum.
- Because if the person who received it is not punished, the person who gave it will be.
Well, Miss Coles?
Which is it to be?
- What exactly do you want to know?
- Just the name of the person to whom you gave that information.
- I gave it to no one.
- Then you will be court marshaled tomorrow on a charge of espionage, and you know that for that there is only one penalty in German law.
- What's that?
- [Graum] The state execution of...
- Oh yes, of course.
I'd forgotten, you've gone back to the ax of the Middle Ages.
- But we wear modern dress.
White gloves, white tie.
- White waistcoat?
The dress of an English gentleman at a dinner, a French gentleman at a weddin, and a German gentleman--
- Yes, Herr Professor?
- At a murder.
- That's good, Herr Professor,
I must remember that.
Excuse me.
- Hold on.
My dear child, to a man of peace like myself all this seems incredible.
But in your own interest if you do know anything, wouldn't it be wiser to speak?
- Take her away.
- May I say a word?
General von Graum, you appear to regard me with some suspicion.
First of all you confront me with an individual who is supposed to identify me as something or other but refuses to do so.
Next you threaten the life of this young lady on the presumption that I shall make a gallant gesture and declare myself as this fellow you want.
But I'm not in a position to do that.
- I see.
Go on.
- Well, after such a procession of disappointments, you surely cannot intend to commit the crowning folly of cutting off your chief source of information.
In the absence of any hint of subtlety, it doesn't surprise me that this rescuer has been so successful.
Still, it's no concern of mine, I just came here to talk about Shakespeare.
Perhaps you'd care to read about the Earl of Oxford.
I do wish it were in my power to help you.
Well, goodbye.
- Professor.
You should have been a detective.
- Me?
Oh, thank you.
- Alright Miss Coles, you can go.
- Does that mean I'm free?
- For the moment, yes.
Perhaps the professor would care to see you home.
- Oh dear.
I'm afraid I'm a very poor escort.
Well, allow me.
I hope you won't regret taking my advice.
- I shan't.
- Why did you let her go?
- It's not her I want, you fool, it's him.
That man, with his English superiority, seems to be mocking at our greater German world power.
And I've got to get him.
Got to!
- Yes, Herr Reich Minister.
- How are you feeling?
- Alright.
- No, don't ask me any questions.
We are not alone.
Ah.
How about a glass of wine?
You need it.
- But if my father's safe, why can't I go to him?
- Because we want to keep him safe.
- Is he in Berlin?
- The fewer people who know where he is, the better.
Here, drink your wine, it'll do you good.
Excuse me.
You like music?
- No.
- Good.
Enjoy yourself.
Waiter?
- Sir?
- Take some wine with my compliments to that unhappy looking fellow over there.
- Very good, sir.
Cigarette?
- Is that him?
- That's him.
I've given him wine and music, and I'm afraid that's all I can do for him.
- I think you're the bravest man I've ever met.
- You mustn't exaggerate, especially after your own remarkable courage.
- But if you've no fear for yourself, what about those who depend on you?
- Nobody does.
I'm a bachelor.
- I wonder why.
- Well I'll tell you a secret.
Years ago I fell in love.
And I've been in love ever since.
- Is she pretty?
- Not pretty.
Divinely beautiful.
- Is she English?
- No, she's Greek.
Would you like to see her photo?
I always carry one with me.
- But that's--
- Aphrodite Kallipygos.
The perfect woman.
I found her at Lesbos.
Ours is an ideal relationship, you know.
They say no woman compares with her physical perfection.
And as for her mental equipment, well, I try to supply that.
- Do you never wish she could come to life?
- I've always thought that would be most unsatisfactory.
In fact during the last few days, suddenly she's become less real to me.
Just marble.
It's a pity.
- Oh.
- Well, I think we better be going now.
And in opposite directions, I'm afraid.
You better go first, alone.
Now I want you to trust me implicitly.
It's going to be hard, but whatever happens, you mustn't get in touch with us or try to see us.
This is going to be a battle of nerves.
We're going to be watched day and night, but you must trust me to the end.
- I will.
I will, whatever happens.
- Don't worry.
I promise you I won't leave Germany without you.
- Give my love to father, and keep some for yourself.
Goodbye.
- A week.
A whole week, and what has happened?
Nothing to report, nothing to report.
The girl has been to a hairdresser, and he has kept digging.
Why?
Why?
Why?
What's his game?
I can't stand this waiting any longer!
- Say Prof, we've dug up half of Germany.
What do we do now?
- Dig up the other half.
- Thank you.
All that's for the Berlin Museum.
- Thank you, I am most grateful.
- Not at all.
You've been most helpful, Doctor.
- I wish I could do more.
One has to be careful.
- I know.
Thank you.
What are you doing with that?
- Just bringing a little sunshine into their lives.
- Well give them my love.
- What's the matter?
- The gestapo!
- Where?
Alright.
- This is where I go to work.
- Go on, hurry up.
- Oh David, I wanted to ask you--
- Shh.
Gestapo.
- Professor Smith?
- Come along, please.
- You must excuse my coming unannounced, but you did invite me.
I brought some of my boys.
- Delighted.
Well, what a large family.
- You don't mind their taking a look around?
They're so interested in your operation.
- Not at all.
Make yourselves at home, gentlemen.
You know Dr. Fulroth of the Berlin Museum?
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
- Dr. Fulroth is making a catalog of the relics which your government is permitting us to take back to England.
- Professor Smith's discoveries have been quite remarkable.
And he's been most generous in his gifts to our museum.
- So.
- Yes, you'll be surprised what we've discovered about an Aryan civilization.
- What's in there?
- Relics, pottery, weapons.
- Here?
- Same thing.
- And here?
- A man.
- Hmm?
- A dead man.
Would you like to see him?
There we are.
Buried with all his weapons, you see.
Presumably in the belief that there might be a rearmament program in the hereafter.
Eh, Mr. Spencer?
An ancient tutor.
Alas, poor Yorrick.
Get thee to my lady's chamber, my dear General.
Tell her though she paint an inch thick, to this favor must she come.
Make her laugh at that.
The Earl of Oxford wrote that, you'll remember.
- Herr Reich Minister.
No.
- No?
- No.
- So.
- What, going already?
Then we'd better say goodbye, for we shall be leaving ourselves in the morning.
- Whew.
It's okay boys, they've gone.
- Well never get out of here, never.
They'll watch us day and night.
- Take it easy, buddy.
- The professor won't fail us, we'll get away alright.
- Yes, but how?
- Packed in bran and marked fragile.
- Changing guard sir.
- All present and correct.
- What are you taking so much care of?
- Red herrings.
- Hmm?
- Red herrings.
- Well, what did he say?
- He's gone, fraulein.
- Gone?
- Yes, he left for England on the 10:30 train this morning.
They've all gone.
- But he can't have.
- But it's true.
I spoke to the hall porter who put their luggage on the taxi.
They've gone alright.
- Thank you.
- Miss Koslowski.
Get out.
Sit down.
I require some information which only you can give me.
- Where are we now?
- We're nearly at Felden Kirschen sir.
- And what's the exact time?
Means we're four minutes late.
- Good.
Not very long to wait.
You all know what to do?
- Oh yes sir.
- Two hours to the frontier.
And with ordinary luck, gentlemen, our last adventure will be successfully concluded.
In case there's no opportunity to do so later,
I want to tell you now that your conduct throughout, in spite of occasional fits of lunacy, has been most exemplary.
I do hope the trip has proved instructive.
- It has, sir.
- I suppose we shall all be meeting again pretty soon at Cambridge, sir?
- I wonder.
I have an idea that our country may have more important work for us.
Anyway, I do thank you all.
You, Steve.
- Goodbye, sir.
- And you, Herbert.
- Bertie, sir.
- Bertie.
- And Jock and--
- Clarence.
- Clarence, of course, yes.
And David.
- How did you remember all those names, sir?
- Excuse the familiarity, Mr. Maxwell.
Oh by the way, I owe you an apology.
I did my best at Cambridge to prevent your joining this expedition.
I admit now that would have been a mistake.
Oh.
Allow me to return to you your bones.
- Take care of yourself, Prof.
- I will.
Now gentlemen, I'm just going to take a little nap.
Meanwhile, do your stuff.
- Sure.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight sir.
- Goodnight sir.
- That's the signal.
- Excuse me.
One of us is gonna move, pal, and it isn't gonna be me.
- This is it.
- We'll never get through, never.
We don't stand a chance.
- We'll all get through.
We are in good hands.
- I'm a bit nervous myself, Koslowski.
- Not Koslowski here, please.
- When we enter Poland, they won't be long now, the restoration of order scheme B is to be put into operation immediately, understand?
In Holland, Denmark, and--
- Reich Minister?
- Don't bother me.
- A report from the train, sir.
The professor is asleep.
- Oh, the professor's asleep.
- And the students are guarding the packing cases.
- Don't bother.
Did you say packing cases?
- Yes sir.
They had permits to take--
- Packing cases, precisely.
- Train's coming in, get ready there.
- Turn out those cases as soon as she stops.
- Where is he?
- Here he is.
- Oh.
Are we here yet?
- That's not him.
- You idiot, what have you been doing?
- What are you guys looking for?
- Professor Smith.
We've a warrant for his arrest.
- Well, you'll be unlucky, he's not here.
- Excuse me, but I saw a very suspicious character just now.
- Where was he?
- In there.
But it's not a he, it's a she.
- You old fool!
Telephone headquarters right away!
- David, those sons are breaking open our crates!
- What?
- Yes madam, give me your passport please, thank you.
Cooks party, cooks party, passports please, all your passports, cooks party.
I want your passports please.
Passports, anymore passports?
Cooks party.
- Say, what is it?
We've a government permit to clear these cases unopened!
- Keep your mouth shut!
- Excuse me, excuse me.
Please.
I wish to make a complaint.
- Pass along, please.
- I've been grossly insulted.
- I'm sorry.
Pass along please.
- And manhandled!
- Madam, please, don't you see the officer's busy?
- It's disgraceful!
I'm a married woman.
And in 30 years of married life I have never been manhandled.
- What can I do about it?
Alright, take your (mumbles) away.
- Alright, come along, Cooks party, this way please.
- It's an outrage!
I shall report it!
- Thank you.
- Bits of stone.
- What did you expect?
Ostrich feathers?
- Aren't you gentlemen with the Cooks party?
- Sure.
Sure we are.
- Well come along gentlemen, come along.
The rest of the party's already across the frontier.
- You.
But I didn't expect.
- I told you I'd come back for you.
- But, but I thought--
- That I'd forgotten my promise?
- No.
Yes.
Graum's been here for hours.
I don't know.
They never left me alone.
They said you'd gone away.
They said my father'd been arrested again.
They never stopped asking questions!
They never stopped talking!
- Your father's safely across the frontier.
- Oh.
Is he?
- Quite safe.
- What have I done?
You'll never forgive me for what I've done?
- I'll never forgive you if you don't put on your coat.
We haven't much time you know.
- Yes but in the end you see I did tell them things.
They tricked me into them.
I didn't know what to do.
It seemed the only way to save my father.
They said they'd shoot him!
- So of course you told them.
You're so human.
They haven't wasted much time.
- Why did you come back?
- Tell me, is there any other way out of this house except the front door?
- Yes, the back door, and the fire escape.
Why did you come back?
- Because I said I would.
Come here.
Here, put this on.
Yes.
- Open up there, come on, hurry up.
Out of the way.
Locked.
Open up, open up!
- They've gone.
The fire escape!
Come with me.
You go down and bring the car around to the back.
Wireless the headquarters, they can't have got far.
Come on.
- Well I'm almost ashamed to have used that old trick.
But it nearly always works.
- What do we do now?
- Now, in the immortal words of Mr. Maxwell, we scram.
Twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe.
- Any news?
- Not yet sir.
- I will not be beaten by that archaeologist!
It's a matter of personal honor!
- I can assure you, Herr Reich Minister, that every train is being checked and every frontier watched.
He can't get away.
In a few moments I shall be able to give you some definite information.
- Well see to it.
I'll get him myself, understand?
Myself!
- When do we get there?
- About 25 minutes.
- And then?
- Then, England.
- England.
I've never been to England.
- Well there are varying opinions about it.
There was an Englishman named Rupert Brook who was also in Germany when he said,
"God I will pack and take a train,
"and get me to England once again,
"for England's the one land I know
"where men with splendid hearts may go."
And women with splendid hearts too.
- Good morning, Professor Smith.
- Good morning.
- Will you come with me?
- What for?
- I have orders to detain you.
- I'm coming too.
- No madam, your train is waiting.
Take this lady through the barrier.
- I won't go without you.
- I shall be alright.
Go straight to Montalier, Hotel Excelsior.
Your father's waiting for you.
- But you, can you manage?
- I shall do my best.
Hurry now, your train is waiting.
Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
- This way please.
In here please, Professor.
- Well, professor of archaeology.
- Well, captain of murderers?
- You won't mind spending a few minutes with me until our special train arrives?
- I take it I have no choice.
- Very little.
- This must be a big moment for you.
- A minor satisfaction.
I wanted to get you out of my system before
I turn my mind to more important matters.
You have become a great nuisance to me, Professor.
Almost an obsession.
But everything comes to an end.
- What particular end did you plan for me?
- Need we go into details?
At least it'll be quick.
- But violent, I suppose.
A strange end for one who despises violence.
At the hands of those who worship it.
The new German god.
- Of course we worship it.
Violence means power, and power crushes opposition!
The epoch of the council chamber is over, Herr Professor.
I tell you that power and strength and violence will rule the world!
- Why are you sweating, my dear General?
It isn't very warm.
Are you afraid of something?
- Afraid.
We Germans fear nothing.
- Ah.
Because you have a pistol.
- Yes.
I have a pistol.
It has eight bullets.
Eight lives.
- And I have 28 lives.
- [Graum] Oh?
- Scientists, men of letters, artists, doctors.
28 saved from your pig and pistol.
And all you've got is my humble self.
Not a very profitable transaction.
- We can afford to make a loss.
Our profits will be tremendous.
Tonight we march against Poland.
And tomorrow will see the dawn of a new order.
We shall make a German empire of the world!
Why do I talk to you?
You are a dead man.
- May a dead man say a few words to you, General, for your enlightenment?
You will never rule the world.
Because you are doomed.
All of you who have demoralized and corrupted a nation are doomed.
Tonight you will take the first step along a dark road from which there is no turning back.
You will have to go on and on, from one madness to another, leaving behind you a wilderness of misery and hatred.
And still you will have to go on, because you will find no horizon, and see no dawn, until at last you are lost and destroyed.
You are doomed, captain of murderers, and one day, sooner or later, you will remember my words.
- Stop!
Come back.
You were never nearer death than at that moment.
- How could one die better than waving goodbye to a friend?
- Alright, take charge of him.
Take him under that lamp where I can see him.
- Herr Reich Minister, be careful.
He's only to step past the barrier, across the frontier.
- That's exactly what I want him to do.
- Ah.
Shot while trying to escape.
- And by me.
By me.
Alright, get out.
I will protect you myself, Professor.
- Would you care for an
English cigarette, General?
It might steady your nerves.
- My nerves are perfectly steady.
- They don't appear to be.
Just an old fashioned match.
There's rather a valuable relic at your feet, General.
May I pick it up to preserve it for the future?
- No.
I will.
- How careless of them to have overlooked it.
It's charming, isn't it?
It proves, among other things, the complete nonexistence of an early Aryan civilization in this country.
- Silence!
- Herr Reich Minister!
- Get back!
Who called you?
Come back!
- Don't worry, I shall be back.
We shall all be back.

What is it?
Cheetah must be seeing things.
What is it, Tarzan?
What is it?
Strange sound in sky.
Big. Far off.
- I don't hear anything.
- Tarzan hear.
- Cheetah hear. Elephants hear.
- I hear it.
- It's like a great wind coming.
- There!
Sounds like it's going to land.
White men no longer make safari.
Come through sky like vultures.
- Tarzan send men away.
- We'll see it.
Boy stay.
Tarzan's right, darling.
You better come with me.
Why doesn't Tarzan want strangers on the escarpment, Mother?
Because he loves us and wants to protect us.
When strangers come from outside, they always cause trouble.
They're always seeking something.
- Something? But what, Mother?
- Well, for instance, gold.
There's lots of yellow stones in the river.
Tarzan says he doesn't want them.
But when they find them, they lose their reason.
They do terrible things.
They even destroy each other.
Cheetah! Now, stop that at once!
Well, it serves you right.
What's the matter?
Escarpment, juju, bwana.
Escarpment taboo.
Escarpment taboo, your grandmother.
Tell your pals we're here to trap lions.
We'll get them.
Place kind of gives me the willies too, Buck.
Queer, wasn't it? The way it suddenly shot up above the clouds?
Another couple of feet, we'd smack right into it.
- Still looks like Africa to me.
- I know, but try and find it on the map.
Gentlemen! We're in luck.
The place is alive with lions!
- Tracks everywhere!
- Good.
I figured those were lions
I saw from the air.
Bwana, juju-man come.
Tarzan!
The ape-man they talked about back at the settlement.
Then it's true, he's not a myth.
- Hey! What's the idea?
- Gun no good!
- Men go!
- Wait a minute!
- You think you run Africa?
- Take it easy, Buck.
This is his neck of the woods.
Now, gentlemen, gentlemen, we're forgetting.
I think introductions are in order.
My name is Manchester Mountford, the world-famous animal trainer.
This is Mr. Jimmie Shields, our pilot.
This gentleman is Mr. Buck Rand, well-known hunter and animal man.
See, we've come from America to fetch lions.
- Men go!
- Oh, we can't very well right now.
It'll be dark. I don't fly through strange country at night.
We'll have to wait until morning.
Tomorrow sun make new safari.
When shadow come between sticks, men go!
I suppose he means when the tall stick's shadow pulls back to the short stick.
All right, get back to work.
Be finished in just a minute, Cheetah.
There, finished.
I think Tarzan would like some plums for breakfast.
- That's pretty.
- For Boy. Spear fish.
It's a good idea. He'll love it.
It'll take his mind off the aeroplane.
Thank you, Cheetah.
Oh, those are nice plums.
Tarzan, what were those men like?
One man bad. Other man funny.
- And the third man, what was he like?
- Third man make iron bird fly.
Maybe good. Understand Tarzan.
Oh, I won't be happy until I see that plane flying away in the morning.
Look!
Did you see my airplane?
Did you? Did you see it fly?
Looks like the airplane we saw.
Boy, look what Tarzan has made you.
For Boy. Spear fish.
- Where're we going? The jungle?
- No. Down mountain. Big waterfall.
If we went in the jungle, we might see the airplane.
- Just pass by, I mean.
- Airplane leave with sun.
- It won't leave during the night?
- No, darling.
This is strange country.
They wouldn't fly at night.
Sure?
- Boy sleep now. Spear fish tomorrow.
- All right, Tarzan. Good night.
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, darling.
I wish I could get just one look at the airplane.
Maybe I could make one like it myself.
Boy see plane when new sun climb mountain.
- Did you change your mind?
- Boy see plane. In sky.
That's right. He'll see it when it takes off. I hadn't thought of that.
- I hope he won't be too disappointed.
- Boy forget plane soon.
Maybe.
Tarzan know. Tarzan catch giant bird.
Train bird. Boy fly.
Good heavens, no! I don't want him hurtling through the sky on a bird's neck.
- He's daring enough as it is.
- Boy little Tarzan.
And I want him to grow up to be a big Tarzan.
- Tarzan watch Boy.
- I know you will. I shouldn't worry.
I know there's never a need to worry as long as you're with me.
At first I used to have so many little fears for myself, for Boy.
But one by one, you chased them away.
Wouldn't it be strange if someday
I became as brave as you are?
Jane no need to be brave.
Jane beautiful. Jane good.
You're my goodness, darling.
My strength.
Jane, Tarzan. Tarzan, Jane.
Come on. Cut out the monkeyshines.
Get those crates aboard.
Load them on the other side.
- What're you doing? Starting trouble?
- No, just trying to avoid it.
I'd say we've got a half an hour.
We've got until the last trap's loaded, and we don't go before.
Now, gentlemen, perhaps we could sit down with Mr. Tarzan and talk it over.
- A white boy?
- Here? A phenomenon.
He rides that bull like an old-timer.
It's big, isn't it?
How's it fly? Like a bird?
No, sonny. The wings don't move. That blade there going around does the trick.
You mean that big fan?
It makes it fly?
Say, young fella, where'd you come from?
I live here with Tarzan and Jane.
- Did Tarzan send you here?
- No, sir, he didn't. I came by myself.
- Could this carry an elephant like Simba?
- It might if you could get him aboard.
- You got those elephants trained?
- They do what I tell them.
- Truly a phenomenon!
- A natural.
- What makes the fan go?
- What else can the elephants do?
You're the man who drives the plane.
- I'm the pilot. How'd you figure it out?
- You look like you like the sky.
Well, thanks, sonny.
- Say, that's okay.
- Reminds me of one of my old acts.
- Can I go inside?
- Sure you can.
Wait, they know any more tricks?
Yes, sir. They can do almost anything
I ask them to.
Steady now, Buli. Buli, I won't hurt you.
Stay still.
There.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
That kid would be a sensation in a circus.
I can see the 24-sheets now.
The boy-king of the jungle!
He'd be a gold mine if we had him back in America.
I get it. Now that you've got the lions for Sargent's mangy circus...
...you figure on snatching the boy too.
- You're wonderful, sonny.
- Now may I go inside?
You sure can. Listen, sonny boy, as soon as we get these crates aboard...
...we'll take you for a ride.
- I can ride?
Lay off, Buck! Go on home.
Take your animals and go home.
- I promised the kid a ride, didn't I?
- Not with me at the stick, you didn't.
Now, do what I say, sonny, get going!
- He'd be a headliner under the big top.
- The chance of a lifetime.
- You got religion suddenly, didn't you?
- I like to stay on the beam when I can.
It works out better all around.
- That shadow's getting pretty close.
- I'll worry about that shadow.
I would, if I were you.
Better check that last trap, Mountie.
We'll get out of here.
Two. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on. Get these crates aboard and get that tent down.
Lion tracks.
Come back here, boy.
Boy, let this net down. Come here.
Watch yourself!
Get on. Watch it, sonny.
- Bwana, bwana, lions! Lions!
- Mountford man, caught in trap!
- Thanks. You came just in time.
- All right, sonny.
Buck, it was wonderful. You should've seen that little laddie charge that lion...
...just as he was to rip me to ribbons.
- He did?
- So you're a lion man too?
- Sonny, I owe you my life.
The Jaconi.
- Boy! Tarzan go!
- I'm going too.
Tarzan! Tarzan's coming!
Tarzan!
Let me go! Let me go!
The fire will burn them to a crisp.
The wind's blowing in that direction
No use, sonny.
You've got to come with us.
- I wanna go to Tarzan.
- You can't get through.
Come on, Mountie, head for the plane.
What's he doing here?
Jaconi got his father and mother, killed them, set fire to them.
Jane. Jane. Jane!
Tarzan...
...what is it?
What's Cheetah saying?
- Cheetah say Boy gone in iron bird.
- The hunters took him?
Cheetah say yes.
Oh, Tarzan, they'll take him away.
They'll take him across the sea.
- Jane, be brave.
- Oh, darling, whatever will we do?
Our whole world's gone.
Tarzan find Boy.
Big place. Find Boy.
Tarzan, wait.
You trust me, darling, don't you?
Tarzan always trust Jane.
If it were for any reason less than our Boy, I'd make you turn back.
We're going into places where men's minds are more tangled...
...than the worst underbrush in the jungle, and I'm afraid.
More afraid than I've ever been in my life.
Everywhere we'll be met with lies and deceit.
Your honesty and directness will only be handicaps.
It'd break my heart to see your strength caught in the quicksands of civilization.
And I'll be the only guide you'll have.
Will you follow me?
Will you do as I say?
I'll try not to fail you.
Jane lead way.
Tarzan follow always.
- Tarzan.
- Gun!
Tarzan sorry.
This must be the plane. Cargo of wild animals, three men and a boy.
- Boy!
- Tarzan.
The plane was cleared by pilot
Jimmie Shields for New York.
- Jimmie Shields?
- That's correct, sir.
- I'm sorry I haven't more information.
- Oh, you've been very kind.
- But now we must find our Boy.
- Come. We go to New York quick.
- Is it possible to charter a plane?
- No, I'm afraid not.
But our regular mail plane connects with a clipper for America.
That's due in tomorrow morning.
I can arrange for you to have a passage on that.
- But it'll cost an awful lot of money.
- We'll pay anything.
Shouldn't this be enough?
Oh, that's more than plenty.
But I doubt our local bank will be able...
...to convert these gold nuggets into currency.
- Still, I'll arrange letters of credit for you.
- Oh, I wish you would.
Thank you for all your kindness.
Oh, there's just one more detail, madam.
Our local Chinese tailor carries ladies' and gentlemen's apparel.
Not exactly Paris models or Bond Street suits.
We do need some clothes.
We better go, darling.
We'll be very busy between now and tomorrow morning.
Good man. Tarzan thank.
Oh, not at all, sir.
I hope you find your boy all right.
Bigger suit, you try on.
This is last one. Careful, please.
Three pounds, please. No can do.
No more jackets.
But we're leaving tomorrow, and we must have clothes.
- Can't you make some?
- Take time, missy.
Well, I'll triple the price.
I try.
- Suit ready, missy. This way please.
- Very well. Tarzan, you must stay.
The tailor has to measure you. Sorry, but we must get clothes to go to New York.
- Jane get clothes. Tarzan better without.
- Now, darling, you promised.
Cheetah, you behave yourself.
You look wonderful, darling.
Scratch. No good.
Take off. Put on in New York.
No, no, no, you've got to get used to it.
There.
- Thank you so much.
- Missy pleased, Sun Lee pleased.
Cheetah, come.
Well, where is she?
Stone jungle.
Yes, a man-made jungle.
- Natives live there?
- Yes, they live and they work there.
- Why?
- To help them concentrate their efforts.
- Get things done in a hurry. Save time.
- Save time? Why?
Darling, you're asking me a question all the sages haven't been able to answer.
We're going down.
We're going to land.
Now, these are 30-day permits.
- You understand, lady, don't you?
- Yes.
Mike, call up the pilot's room. See if they know where Jimmie Shields is.
He's in Alaska by now or the South Pole, that is if he has the price of the gas.
Right over there, please.
There are some routine things to attend to, like fingerprinting, just routine.
- Come, Tarzan.
- Hurry. Find Boy.
You must be patient, darling.
We're almost finished.
Cheetah. Now, Cheetah, stop it.
- Sorry, she gets playful sometimes.
- Cheetah thirsty.
Here's where Shields stays, the Gloucester Hotel.
- I'm very grateful.
- Sure.
- Find Boy!
- We will...
...since we know where the pilot lives.
Go! Go. Cheetah!
- Taxi?
- Yes, please.
- House on wheels?
- It's called a taxicab, dear.
Taxicab?
Don't worry! It'll hold together!
Open the door, darling. Thank you.
Gloucester Hotel, please.
Cheetah, you'd better sit over here, dear.
I hope that monkey's tame.
You don't need to worry.
She's quite friendly.
Just so long as she knows it.
Man know trail?
Of course, darling.
Taxi drivers know the city.
- Like Tarzan know jungle.
- Yes, like Tarzan know jungle.
- War dance. Where natives?
- There're no natives. That's music.
It comes out of that little box.
It's called a radio.
Radio?
Woman sick. Cry for witch doctor.
You should be a critic, darling.
There. How's that?
Good. Now radio good.
I don't like it. I don't like it.
Jasper, grab these bags.
Jaconi tribe. Put clothes on him too.
Oh, darling.
- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you, ma'am.
Thank you. Come, Tarzan.
Why, good afternoon.
Good afternoon. We'd like to see
Mr. Jimmie Shields, please.
I'm sorry, but Mr. Shields isn't in now.
As a matter of fact, he hasn't been here for several days.
Did he have a little boy staying with him?
A cute little boy, sun-brown curly hair?
- Why, no madam.
- Where Boy?
I don't know. All I know is he didn't bring any boy here.
- Where Shields now?
- That's anybody's guess.
He'll probably turn up in a day or two.
He usually does.
You'll have him contact us when he gets back?
- Yes, madam.
- I think we'd better take a suite.
Yes, madam, but what about the gorilla?
Cheetah? She's part of the family.
- She'll be all right, I promise you.
- Very well, madam.
Cheetah, thank the kind gentleman for letting you stay.
- Hey, what is this?
- Cheetah say thank you.
Take him away!
- Better sit down, dear.
- Follow me, please.
Thank you.
It's all right, boys.
She's just like one of the family.
- Anything else?
- No, thank you.
Thanks, lady.
- Are you looking for Jimmie Shields?
- Yes, we are.
The minute he gets back from a trip...
...he heads straight for the Club
Moonbeam. His girlfriend sings there.
I don't know her name, but she may put you wise to when he'll be back.
The Club Moonbeam. Thank you.
Find Shields, then we get Boy.
- Cheetah say we go now.
- Cheetah must be patient too.
- Patient?
- Yes, darling.
- All right. Jane be boss here.
- Thank you.
Hello. Would you get me the Club Moonbeam, please?
- Why Jane talk to that?
- It's a telephone.
To talk a long way, you talk into this.
Telephone good.
Telephone say where Boy is?
Oh, I hope so.
Hello, Club Moonbeam?
Yes, ma'am, this am the Club Moonbeam.
No, ma'am.
Ain't nobody around here.
- That's excepting me.
- Well, when will someone be there?
Well, maybe 9:00 tonight.
And that's early.
Well, then I suppose there's nothing we can do except wait.
- Thank you.
- What telephone say?
Not yet, darling.
We have to wait until it's dark.
Oh, Tarzan, I'm just as impatient as you are, but there's nothing we can do now.
Come on, let's go and unpack.
- When dark come, find Boy?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, I thought you got your number. Just a moment, please.
Hello. Hello.
What's that?
This is Sam. Who is this?
What's that?
I said, this is Sam. That's what I said.
What'd you say?
You ain't getting fresh with me, is you, colored boy?
Don't give me none of that double talk!
Hear me?
Why, you... You... You mush-mouth!
Now what?
Cheetah, what are you doing?
Now, you give me that telephone right away.
Yes. Don't you dare touch that anymore. The idea!
Good heavens, what's that?
- Tarzan!
- Big rain good!
Look at your clothes! Come on out and take those wet things off.
Oh, feel good.
You can't look for Boy with wet clothes on.
- Why?
- Just isn't done, that's all.
Come on out. I'll call the valet.
You get these wet things off.
Oh, Cheetah, my things.
How could you?
There. Now we're all ready to go.
Cheetah wants help find Boy.
I think it will be better if Cheetah stays right here.
And, Cheetah, you remember no more beauty treatments.
Cheetah.
Smells like Swahili swamp.
Why people stay?
It's called "a good time."
Good evening.
Have you reservations?
We're not staying. We're looking for a friend, Jimmie Shields.
Oh, yes, Mr. Shields isn't here.
Hasn't come in yet.
- Mr. Shields' friend?
- Yes.
- Wanna talk to you.
- Beat it, halfback.
- Break it up.
- Tarzan, don't. She's singing.
- Come on.
- Talk now. You Jimmie's friend?
- Just a minute.
- Hold it, Eddie.
As marvelous as I am,
I can't do two things at once...
...and do them good, so excuse me a split second.
- What's wrong with Jimmie, a crackup?
- No, we're looking for him.
- We want to talk to him.
- I'm Tarzan.
Tarzan?
Fill in with the "Dance of the Hours" for 10 minutes, will you, boys?
When Jimmie gets back from Boston tonight, he'll tell the whole story.
I see. According to the law, someone had to post a bond for $5000...
...with immigration authorities before Boy entered the country.
They tried to raise the money, but they couldn't.
- Tarzan understand.
- This circus man, Sargent...
...posted the bond, and has Boy.
He's at Boundbrook,
Long Island at a circus.
- The show will be out in a half-hour.
- You've been too kind.
Forget it, honey.
Never a cover charge.
Jimmie'll call me, and I'll tell him you're here.
Meanwhile, watch out for Sargent.
He works fast.
- Tarzan get Boy.
- I'll gamble on that.
Cheetah!
Cheetah! Cheetah, how could you?
Cheetah!
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- Thank you.
- We go now.
Good idea, before someone begins hollering for the gendarmes.
- I'm awfully sorry.
- Thanks. Come again.
Get out there as soon as you can.
Good luck.
- That's my hat!
- It ought to fit you now.
What is that?
Elephant language?
Yes. Tarzan taught me.
I was telling Allie...
...about the baby elephants in the jungle.
The fun we used to have together. She'd like to go back and play with them.
I told Allie I wish we could go back together.
It's a pity we ever took you away...
...to troupe under a piece of canvas with thugs like Sargent and Buck.
Mr. Mountford, a lot of times
I've been gonna run away.
Go back to the jungle.
It doesn't make much difference where I go anymore.
Were you telling her about Tarzan?
I told her there wouldn't be fun in the jungle without Tarzan.
She's heard about him.
All the elephants have.
They'd know Tarzan if he came here and spoke to them.
Your father was a great man, wasn't he?
Yes, Mr. Mountford.
He wasn't like men here in civilization.
He was big and alive, like the jungle.
Mr. Mountford, at noon, sometimes when I go for a walk...
...I look up at a skyscraper. Sometimes
I think Tarzan's up there too...
...in the clouds, just like he was in the escarpment.
Gee, the fun we used to have.
- Why's Pinkus out of his cage?
- I was playing with him.
Did I tell you to stop taking the animals out?
- Yes.
- Well, put him back.
- Please, Mr. Buck.
- Pinkus wasn't hurting anybody.
Cut out the slobbering and put him back.
- Kid, where you going?
- I've got cablegram for Mr. Sargent.
I'll take it.
We're due to fold in a couple of days if this keeps up.
Less than $400 in the house tonight.
Here, maybe this will solve our problems.
- Sawdust and spangles!
- It's from the Matson Show.
From Tim Matson. Listen to this.
"Will give you $ 100,000 for Boy and all rights to his act."
A hundred grand. Say, that's the softest take we've had in quite a while.
"Meet show in Rio de Janeiro on the 10th. You can make it...
...by South American clipper if you leave on the sixth. Regards, Tim Matson."
This is the fourth. That gives us two days to get money for the tickets.
We should clear that much if we stall payroll tomorrow night.
Then the kid's their worry, not ours.
- How's the kid tonight?
- All right.
- He's pretty good around Mountie.
- Keep him happy.
- He means a lot to us.
- Leave it to me, colonel.
Cheetah, stay!
- Tarzan.
- What's that?
Over there.
Quick. Get the kid off the lot while I stall him.
- Say, mister.
- Yeah?
- Where is Mr. Sargent?
- In that red wagon.
- In here?
- Yeah.
- Where Boy?
- Boy? What boy?
Our son.
He's here. We've come for him.
If you've lost your son, I'm sorry, but why pick on me?
- Tell truth.
- Don't come closer.
Darling, please.
Remember, Tarzan...
...you promised to do as I asked.
- Your wife is a sensible woman.
- You don't mind going now...
- Mr. Sargent, it's no use evading things.
We know you have Boy because you posted an immigration bond for him.
Boy here.
- Tarzan!
- Hey, Jack.
Gather the boys at the red wagon.
- Right.
- Go ahead.
- Satisfied?
- No.
- Tarzan not go till we find Boy!
- You're going right now.
There's no Boy around here, and I'm tired trying to convince you.
What does that mean?
Now find Boy.
All right, break it up.
Spread out, men.
Come on. Spread out, boys.
Tarzan!
Don't worry. I brought the cops along in case, knowing Mr. Sargent as I do.
It looks like you guessed right.
Come on now, boys, clear out.
- Now we get Boy.
- Why, yes. What about that boy?
- This man's taken him.
- What about it?
Here, this will explain.
This is a receipt for a bond from U.S. Immigration.
It gives Sargent temporary custody of a nameless boy, parents dead.
- Tarzan's Boy!
- Now, Tarzan, it can't be settled here.
You could level the show, and you'd never find him.
There's only one way to get him back, the law.
He's right.
You'd only find trouble here.
We'd better trust the law.
- Ask law, get Boy back.
- Yes.
We'll go to court.
It won't take long.
- And I'll get you a lawyer.
- Lawyer? What's lawyer?
To help to get Boy back.
Tarzan wait. Tarzan see!
Get Boy back. Cheetah.
- Thanks, Chuck.
- Okay.
The affidavits show that Boy was taken from the jungle...
...a spot in the Congo known as "the escarpment"...
...where he lived with my clients.
He was taken by Mr. Sargent's agent, brought here...
...where Mr. Sargent posted an immigration bond for him...
...and instituted adoption proceedings.
Your client opposes the return of the boy to his parents?
- Yes.
- On what grounds?
The jungle isn't a home for him.
He's filed adoption papers.
Naturally, we will oppose any move to adopt this boy.
I have more expert witnesses on jungle life...
...if Your Honor will permit.
- All right.
- Take the stand, Tarzan.
Tarzan, sit in that chair.
Hand on the book.
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
- Tarzan always tell truth.
- What's your name?
- Tarzan.
- Full name?
That's the only name he has.
You have educated your son, haven't you?
I mean, well, what did you teach the boy?
Teach Boy where to find water when thirsty, where to find food when hungry.
Tarzan teach Boy to be strong like lion and happy like bird.
You find everything you need in the jungle, do you?
Wise men need little.
Have you thought what would become of Boy if he grows up in the jungle?
Boy grow up to be brother of sun and friend of rain.
Hurt nobody.
Want nothing people have.
Grow old like cedar tree.
Boy will be good man, happy man.
No one can want more than that.
That's all, thank you.
- Can you read, Tarzan?
- Read?
Yes, read. Read a book.
Ever hear of Shakespeare's Hamlet?
Tarzan read trails in jungle.
Read clouds in sky.
- Lawyer ever hear of kinsin-nupa?
- Kinsin- what?
Kinsin-nupa. Cure snakebites.
All babies in the jungle know that.
- This is a court of law.
- White man's law lots of words.
Jungle law more easy.
Man live own life.
So you prefer the jungle code to civilized law?
In jungle, men only kill bad animals.
In civilization, men kill good men.
Will Mr. Norton concede human life is in constant peril...
...in this wild region from which this child was rescued?
No, I will not concede any such thing.
In the last year, 35,000 men, women and children were killed...
...in auto accidents alone in this country.
I object. Counsel's remarks are immaterial.
Objection denied.
Proceed, Mr. Beaton.
- If the court please...
- Yes.
I submit, Your Honor...
...the jungle is not an issue in this case.
The only issue is guardianship.
Are these two people morally fit to bring up an adolescent to proper manhood?
It is my contention that they are.
By his conduct in this court,
Tarzan has proved himself no savage...
...but rather uniquely civilized.
You may resume cross-examining the witness.
No more questions.
Your Honor, I'd like to place my last witness on the stand.
Very well.
By the way, Tarzan, how's fishing on this escarpment of yours?
- Big fish.
- How big?
Lipamani, so big.
Malagani fish, so big.
Is that so?
As a civilized fisherman...
...I would have stretched the truth at least a foot.
Jane is right. Law good.
Give Boy back.
Soon, dear.
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Before going to the jungle, you lived a long while in civilization?
- Yes, in London.
- Did you like it?
I had everything money could buy.
In comparison, how do you like the jungle?
There is no comparison.
I wouldn't live anywhere else.
Is it a good place to raise a son?
It teaches him most things he needs to know...
...how to live simply, naturally, happily.
You say that as a mother, with a mother's instinct and wisdom?
A mother would never wrong her own son.
Thank you, madam. Your witness.
Tell me what you do in the jungle...
...when you need a doctor?
- We seldom do.
But if we do, we have our own drug store too.
Many modern drugs were known and used in the jungle centuries before here.
Digitalis, for example, and quinine, tannic acid, alum.
- Dozens more.
- Has your boy ever been ill?
- No. He grew up healthy and strong.
- Like the other savage animals?
- He's not a savage animal.
- Like animals...
...he was born and raised in the jungle.
- He was not born in the jungle!
Your boy was not born in the jungle?
Where was he born?
- I don't know.
- Well, you're his mother, aren't you?
I prefer not to answer that question.
You'll have to answer, madam.
Remember, you're under oath.
Tell this court, are you the mother of this child? Yes or no?
We found him, Tarzan and I, after an airplane crash in the jungle.
Yes or no?
His parents were killed.
Tarzan and I are the only parents he's ever known.
You came into this court with unclean hands.
You led this court to believe you were the parents...
...when you had no legal claim to him whatever! You lied!
- I did not!
- And he lied!
You steal Boy from me!
Tarzan, stop it! Let go!
Let go! Darling, Tarzan!
Take a look, Your Honor!
He's a man who claims to be a fit guardian for a child. He's a savage!
This hearing is adjourned until tomorrow.
Detain him in the waiting room.
I'll take up the matter of this disturbance later.
Come on.
- What a break.
- You said it.
Let's grab the kid and make that plane.
You were right, Tarzan, as you always are...
...and I was wrong.
I asked you to trust the law...
...and you did. And now...
Listen to me, darling.
I know that man's laws are not for you.
You who are as free as an eagle.
I should've told you to follow your own law.
To find Boy in your own way.
I said this was my jungle.
I was wrong.
Your jungle is my jungle.
I know that now.
- I only hope it's not too late.
- Too late?
I hope not. I hope not.
- Jane say go?
- Yes, darling.
Tarzan go. Tarzan get Boy.
Come back! You'll break your neck!
The roof! Quick!
Hey!
Tarzan just escaped from court.
He's in a Globe taxicab believed headed for the circus on Long Island.
Stop all Globe cabs crossing the bridge.
They're after Tarzan, who's in the papers.
Follow that cab that just went by and see who's inside.
- What's that noise?
- That's the law, mister.
Law? Quick! Circus, hurry!
- Didn't you hear that siren?
- Yes.
Come down before you break your fool neck.
Look, fella, it's no use trying!
Give it up!
Tarzan.
- Make them come and get you!
- Keep climbing!
Good luck, old boy!
Maybe we'd better go.
- I'm not afraid.
- That's a 200-foot dive.
He can't make it and live.
- Boy, what nerve!
- We'd better take you home.
- No, we're going to the circus.
- Circus?
- Yes.
- Tarzan will be there. Come on.
Open up, boys.
I'll take him.
Let the lad go!
- Put that gun away!
- It's full of blanks.
Four are, but the fifth one's the getaway, and you know it.
Come on, sonny. Get out of here.
Tarzan'll be here soon.
Stick him in the wagon.
You saw nothing.
- Okay.
- Is he all right?
Come on down out of there, kid, before you get hurt.
Hey! Go up there and get him down.
Come on, hurry up!
Get up there! Get up!
Look out! He's gonna swing!
- Get him.
- Get up there. Climb that ladder.
Go on! Hurry up, Pete!
Come on down, son.
You can't get away.
Tarzan! Tarzan! Here I am!
Tarzan! Here I am!
Let him come down. I'll stop him.
Put that gun away!
We're in enough of a jam as it is.
Get some men over to that other pole!
Get around that net!
Now's your chance, Buck.
Yank out those net poles!
Stay! Boy, stay!
- Coming through!
- Look out!
Take him over to the animal tent.
Put him in a cage.
Right in here. Come on.
Quickly. Go on.
Come on! Get him in there!
All right, you men!
Come on. Hurry up!
Come on. Hurry up!
You better come down now.
- We'll get you sooner or later.
- I won't!
Strike the whole rig.
Get him out of that side there!
Simba!
Simba!
Let him down easy. Easy now.
Easy.
Let me go!
Let me go, I tell you!
I wanna go back to Tarzan!
Let me go!
Let's get going.
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Don't!
Let me go, I tell you.
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Get back!
Look out!
Watch out!
Go through that tent!
Go around the other way!
Tarzan! Boy!
Oh, Boy, darling.
This place isn't any too healthy.
Come on, get in.
Simba!
And I hereby sentence you to 30 days in jail for contempt of court.
I also sentence you to 30 days for resisting an officer.
Both sentences run concurrently.
But taking into consideration the motive which actuated both misdemeanors...
...I hereby suspend sentence.
- Thanks, Your Honor.
Tarzan, you're free.
Law good. Judge good.
Thank you.
Tell me, when is fishing best down your way?
- Fishing always good.
- Then you'll probably be seeing me.
Well, you can fly down with Connie and me on our honeymoon.
- Well, goodbye and good luck.
- Friend.
Court's adjourned.
Swim.
Madagascar.
For centuries the bloodiest cock pit of all the seas.
Where the infamous brotherhood of the damned awaited to plunder the... treasure laden galleons from India and Cathay.
Then returned drunk with slaughter to their pirate stronghold of Last Hope.
Most ruthless of all was Captain William Kidd.
He encountered the great
London galleon the Twelve Apostles...
Commanded by Admiral Lord Blayne... and approaching unsuspected in the guise of a peaceful merchantman... by a sudden treacherous salvo he reduced her to a burning hulk.
When night fell, the Twelve Apostles was only a blazing funeral pyre on the... placid surface of a Madagascar lagoon.
Stab me, there's a pretty sight.
Will be prettier still when the fire reaches the magazine Captain.
Pity though.
Lot of stout seamen among them.
And with us a long time.
We can none of us live forever Mr Boyle, dead men don't talk.
Man your oars, we got this job to do before high tide.
There, and dig faster, the tide catches here it'll save the King's hangman some rope.
There you are, deep enough to bury a man in.
Give us a hand mate.
- All ready Captain.
- Down she goes.
What are you waiting for?
Well Captain, that chest is been in your cabin a longish time.
And we all thought as it would do no harm to open up that chest... and make sure that what was in it then is in it now.
I suppose you remember what was in it.
Aye, I remember an emerald necklace that came off that Portuguese ship, El Vengar.
And all those pearls that we took from the big ship, the Virgin Queen.
I remember a diamond medallion we got from that Moorish galleon off Madagascar.
And could we ever forget that silver casket with the arms of Lord Blayne... that you claimed for yourself after the taking of the Twelve Apostles sir?
Your neck will be stretched as long as your memory one of this days.
Satisfied, gallows meat? Put them back.
Lower away.
Matter?
Wait a minute Captain, there's something else you forgot.
What do you want to now? We got an half an hour before the tide traps us.
May be sir, we all equal in this I take it.
Equal shares, yes.
Well that key then, what you put back in your belt, that goes down with the chest.
Thus we start all clear and no favors.
If some of us don't get back, it'll be that much easier open for them as does.
Question me honor again, would you? And I'll rip you from belly to chime.
Are we such callous rascals that we'd leave a dead comrade... without commending his soul to his new master?
Here lies one who through treachery and avarice... would've placed in jeopardy the lives of honest men.
And here may he lie forever, in the sands of Madagascar.
Rest in peace.
It's time to be out my lads, time to be away.
If a gentleman is a gentleman, he's gentleman, that's all there's to it, sir
I'm one of nature's gentlemen, but I need polish my good man..
If I'm to improve myself...
A gentleman employs the terminology my good man only when addressing lower servants...
- or his inferior sir.
- You see? That's why I need you.
- In my upbringing...
- A gentleman never sucks his teeth sir.
Many a man's social career has been ruined by less sir.
You seem to know your business.
I want the best mind and I can pay for it.
Hundred quid a year.
An infallible mark of the person of quality... is his reluctance to pay his domestics high wages.
- You don't say so.
- Merely a idiosyncrasy of good breeding sir.
Sixty quid a year then?
You realize I've never been on board a ship before sir.
- Oh don't let that frighten you.
- To the contrary.
In fact, since I was a nipper...
I've a rather adventurous inclination towards life on the bounding main.
- It should be quite educational sir.
- You'll learn a lot, no doubt.
- Is it a bargain then?
- Very well, sir.
My hand on it?
Then, it is your proposal, my Lord Bellomont that Captain Kidd... sail to meet our ambassador Lord
Fallsworth and give him safe convoy through the perilous waters of Madagascar.
- May it please Your Majesty.
- Yes.
That need a bold and adventurous man.
Bring in this Captain Kidd while we take the measure of him.
Captain William Kidd.
Your Royal Majesty and other Lords..
Bellomont, is this your roaring killer of Spanish buccaneers?
Nay me Lord, I'm only a peaceful ship-master who must do trade with other ships... without inquiring too closely about their business.
And it was so I fell into the hands of the Twelve Apostles.
- A King's ship turned pirate.
- In Madagascar waters?
I have never been in
Madagascar waters your Grace.
It was off the southern tip of Africa, where
I had gone to trade in elephant's teeth.
- Who commanded her?
- One of your admirals Your Majesty.
- Name of Lord Blayne.
- He did turn pirating.
Sufficiently me Lords, to put fear in honest traders like myself.
And if you are successful in this voyage
Captain, what reward do you expect?
May it please Your Majesty, having forfeited me honor in that I was... forced to strike me colors to a pirate...
I want no reward but to regain it
In the service of Your Majesty.
Unless it be, is it true that Lord Blayne's lands are estreated and his title forfeit.
Yes.
All, well, all I ask is if I lay this renegade nobleman by the heels... is that you honor the humble self with his castle and his lands.
- Is that all you want Captain Kidd?
- Not a farthing more Your Majesty.
The fellow treats of a title so lightly he must be bursting with noble blood.
Though I confess he keeps it well hid.
Aye sir, you can no more judge of a man by his appearance... than you can judge the extent of a nobleman's brains by the expensiveness of his wig.
Am I to suppose that the Captain of the
King's Guard would deign to fence with me.
Come Captain, is your courage less than your wit?
Nay sir, I know nothing of the fence.
You must come at me, quickly as though you'd kill me.
Very well then.
I ask pardon Sire, I've a hot head when roused, I only meant to demonstrate.
And to good purpose Captain.
Your Majesty is satisfied with the Captain of our choosing?
- I can think of none better.
- I thank you sir.
And now Captain... the main mission of your crew will be to meet a great ship.
The Queda merchant, which is sailing from India with vast treasures.
And to give her safe conduct in my name... past the perilous waters of Madagascar.
But Your Majesty, will her commander accept me letter of mark as sufficient authority to.
You shall have a letter to our ambassador
Lord Fallsworth who's returning in her.
That he is to accept your protection.
And to submit to all matters pertaining to the safety of the ship.
- And her treasures Sire.
- Oh yes.
- And now Sire, me crew...
- Your crew?
Captain Kidd who wishes to recruit a crew from the pirates... now under capital sentence in Newgate and the Marshal sea.
- A crew of condemned pirates?
- Aye Sire.
There's none would be so loyal nor fight so desperately... as cutthroats under sentence of death...
If they knew that at the end of the voyage... a Royal pardon would be in their pockets.
But I shall hold you accountable for their good conduct.
Between their conduct and mine Your
Majesty, there will be little to choose.
And now goodbye.
- And God speed you.
- I am but his unworthy sparrow.
I'd rather eat the bilge slime from an African slaver.
Oh Adam, don't let your temper get you the lash again.
If I must hang I'll hang, but I'll go to the gallows with clean guts at least.
Hey you, what kind of stinking maggots meat is this?
Wardens, wardens.
There's that dainty scum Mercy complaining about the taste of the King's bounty again.
- Watch it.
- Bounty?
Bounty me eye.
The King's allowance is thru-pence a day for food not muck from the sewers of Whitechapel.
Making trouble again, hey Mercy?
I'm asking only what a man is legally entitled to.
Here, smell this.
Delicious.
Hear you Guvnor.
What sort of a kingdom is this?
Where a man is condemned before he's heard and starved before they hang him.
Who is that quarrelsome feller?
Adam Mercy, he is taken in a pirate ship by his Majesty's frigate Wasp.
He's always escaping so that's why we keep him in chains.
He's got a lacing of tiger's blood in him.
This ain't exactly a flower garden, is it?
Oh, forgive me, these are two of me officers Mr Boyle, Guvnor Landers...
Mr Lorenzo, Guvnor Landers.
Spanish blood.
- A pretty lot of sinners.
- Capitán...
Do you think there is anyone down there knows us?
I hope not.
Guvnor, would you be good enough to tell them what we are here for?
Give heed you, you vermin.
Here news to your advantage.
- Is the hangman dead then?
- Out with it then, Jack nasty face.
Is it that your mother's turned into an honest woman?
Silence, you mutinous dogs.
If another man speaks I'll trice him up by the thumbs and flay him raw.
Guvnor, is that the way to win the love of these unfortunate gentlemen?
Now then me bullies, would you rather do the gallows dance... and hang in chains till the crows pick your eyes from your rotting skull... or would you feel the roll of a stout ship beneath your feet again?
I've a vessel, the Adventure galley and the King's commission to sail her.
And for those who show a loyal and a stout heart there's a Royal pardon in the offing.
Which of you knows the waters of Madagascar?
- I do.
- Would you have him unlocked Guvnor?
Warden, unlock him.
Look you then, I want men with iron in their blood and steel in their sinews.
And the first up here is the first enlisted.
Guvnor, if your wardens are ready, would you be good enough to have them lower the ropes.
Lower away.
Here they come, make ready lads.
Put your hands on that,
I'll make you a free man.
The other now.
Next.
Next one, come on.
- Name.
- Philip Shaftstow.
Philip Shaftstow, regardless of the fact that I'm your Captain... you will always address a gentleman as sir scum.
- Aye sir.
- Make your mark.
On board.
- Name.
- Adam Mercy sir.
Oh, so it's you.
Mercy, that's a comical handle for a blade of fortune, Mercy.
It's also something the world needs more of.
A quite and gentle philosopher, you speak cultured.
Were you by any chance a stable boy to a noble house?
Perhaps.
I was also Master Gunner to a buccaneer you may have heard of, Captain Avery.
Avery's Master Gunner?
We needed a Master Gunner
Mr Boyle and from what I've heard...
Avery was a shrewd hand at picking them.
The berth is yours for as long as you can handle it.
I can handle it.
Swivel gun or long arm,
I'll forfeit a guinea for every miss.
You'll forfeit your neck if you miss while you're on my ship. Make your mark.
And you can write.
We'll give you a nice bath, you'll draw a uniform befitting a Master Gunner.
- On board.
- Next man.
- Name.
- Bartholomew Blivens sir.
Bartholomew Blivens, make your mark.
Down below.
- Captain aboard?
- He's over there sir.
Next man.
That's all sir, our complement is full.
- Povey? I thought you...
- Yes, you thought I was dead.
- I can hardly believe my eyes.
- You mean you don't want to believe them.
Now come, come Mr Povey, is that kind or is that fair?
As fair as what you did the day you abandoned me on a Bahama reef.
Oh please Mr Povey, this not the time to talk about that.
Oh, it's the time alright, unless you want me to know.
In which case your present voyage is over before it's begun.
Now, now, now, now, Povey.
Mr Boyle, would you take over, please?
Mr Lorenzo, take the deck watch.
Come to my cabin.
My heart bleeds when I think of one of your... delicate constitution having to fend for yourself on a coral reef Mr Povey.
Come off it Captain.
I know why you marooned me.
You thought there'd be only three of you to share, instead of four.
It's true, a hostile wind did blow us away from your reef.
Between friends, we might've sailed back, it's exactly what you would've done Mr Povey.
So no more of your sentimental nonsense please.
- Now that we are four again, what then?
- We are not four.
We are two, Boyle and Lorenzo, dull clods.
Twenty thousand pounds a piece in their hands would only be spent in sinful ways.
Are you propose to remove them from the path of temptation.
How? A knife in the dark?
I am not a violent man Mr Povey, I detest violence.
People have such an awkward habit of getting in my way.
I'm an ambitious man Mr Povey.
An ambitious man, if he be bold enough, can carve himself a kingdom.
I'm going to be a Lord my friend.
And that for a commoner like myself takes a deal of money.
And that's why there could be two less to share.
- Before we raise old England again?
- You cold-gutted shark.
A flatterer.
Oh, I'm glad you're back in Mr Povey.
You've no idea how gratifying it is to have a congenial soul to confide in.
Thank you.
There's something I want to tell you.
I've left with a trusted friend in London a sealed letter containing an exact... and complete account of certain previous events.
Only to be open in case, just in case of course... you should happen to return to England without me.
Of course my dear fellow, very sensible of you.
Now I know you'll have a happy voyage. I shall too.
I'll look up me quarters.
We are two of the luckiest man alive, just think...
We are sailing for Madagascar waters, we'll pick up the search where we left off.
Every officer on board has a servant.
I'll request the Captain to assign you to me, then we'd be together.
Yes, I've spent a good many years of my life at sea Milady...
But I doubt if any woman minds a dash of salt even in a Peer of the Realm like myself.
Now, if Me Lady would join me in a minuet?
- My Lady sir, not me Lady.
- Blast me Shadwell.
Does one gentleman creep up on another without a cough or a spit or something to warn him?
I'm not a gentleman sir,
I'm a gentleman's gentleman.
Pity about the hair.
I have you've tried everything?
Bear's grease?
Prenatal influence perhaps?
Dinner is served, sir.
- Thank you Shadwell.
- Pardon sir.
I'll show you to your place.
Captain, what's all this mummery?
You can forget your bilge-water manners for the time, Mr Boyle.
You are now officer on a King's ship.
So a man must starve while his manners fatten.
I know, I know.
And in a King's ship it is customary for the officers to rise when the Captain enters.
That's better. Gentlemen be seated.
Well, well, well, what have we here?
- You must not do that sir.
- Of course, but don't press me.
Come Mr Mercy, tell us something about yourself.
You already know whatever's of consequence sir.
While under Avery I was taken by a
King's ship and brought to London.
There I was tried for a pirate and condemned.
You were innocent, of course.
- No sir, I was guilty.
- You speak above your station.
- How came you to go on the account?
- Call it love of adventure... cost in love, scandal, perhaps a mix of all three.
And you've seen something of the world?
Enough sir, to dislike what I've seen and know there's small hope for a better.
Perhaps you prefer the next world Mr Mercy.
You were close enough to it when you were in the condemned hold at Newgate.
But I'm keeping you from your dinner.
And now gentlemen.
A toast to the King and since proposing it is a privilege of the youngest present... the honor falls to Mr Mercy.
- Mr Mercy, we are waiting.
- No sir.
Since I've little love for the King, I'll neither propose his health nor drink it.
Never the less you are on a King's ship.
King's ship or the devil's it's all the same to me sir, I owe him nothing.
You owe him your neck
Mr Mercy, if it were not for his bounty... you'd be dancing daintily on air at Wapping.
I owe my reprieve to you Captain, so to you I'll drink gladly but not to William.
You stand up and drink to his Majesty's health as a King's officer should... or by fire and flame I'll have you shipped back to Newgate on the first vessel we speak.
Gentlemen, the King.
- The King.
- God bless him.
It's curious.
Do you suppose His Majesty put him on board to spy us out?
We've found him chained to a pillar in Newgate.
Wouldn't be to hard for the King to plant him there.
Yes, but why would he speak so openly against the King?
Your wits are even duller than usual Mr Lorenzo.
Have you never heard of the serpent... that takes the color of it's background the better to strike?
- Shadwell...
- Yes sir.
You have a knowledge of high born people and those of the courtship.
- Have you ever seen Mr Mercy before?
- Not before this voyage, sir.
He has as high a spirit as a gentleman of quality, I like him.
Would you find out who he is and where he comes from?
- As you wish sir.
- Thank you Shadwell.
- Foggy night.
- Good evening, Shadwell.
Excuse me sir but you seafaring men always seem to be looking at something... that I never can see...
We are looking for something just over the horizon.
You know sir, I recognized you for a gentleman the moment I saw you sir.
What are you a valet doing at sea?
The Captain employed me to make him socially acceptable sir.
I'm afraid we're too far out for me to swim back.
- If I can be of service to you sir.
- Did the Captain send you here?
- Yes sir.
- Why?
He wants to know who or what you are sir.
Who do they think I am?
Possibly a spy placed on board by His Majesty.
This seemed uneasy sir.
This, this Captain Kidd, how long have you known him? Have you sailed with him before?
Oh, no sir. All I know is, he's a, well, among other things... a merchant captain.
A spy, that's strange.
Why should they be afraid to be spied on?
- Goodnight Shadwell.
- Good night sir.
- Who is he? Where is he from?
- He's a nobody, sir.
He was employed by persons of quality in where he learned his speech and his manners.
It's a matter of judgment.
If you fire on the up-roll, the shot will go over his yardarms.
But if you wait for the down roll, the enemy is coming up. Now watch.
Get ready.
Fire.
Pretty shot Mr Mercy.
Can you do as well with a 74 throwing grape and canister at you?
I've done it sir.
Reload and secure and pick up your practice on the lower quarter swivel gun..
Mr Mercy?
If you sailed with Avery, you must know these waters.
Fairly sir.
If we needed to careen and take on stores, where would you recommend?
Ponticos Bay, it lies...
We draw to much water, you remember Captain...
Remember what?
I only know the Spanish main, these are Madagascar waters.
- Ponticos Bay?
- Aye sir.
Thank you Mr Mercy, come along Mr Boyle.
You blundering ass.
Your presence is becoming increasingly irksome to me, get you below.
Now let's get down to the business of this voyage.
Hand me that chart Mr Boyle.
Capitan, I have been thinking every day and every night.
What about that dinero that was buried in the cave?
What good is it there? Let's get it and get back where we can spend it.
- It stays where it is for a while.
- Why?
We've got a fatter prize sailing right into our pockets.
Now.
Here is our present position, here is Madagascar, here is Calicut.
In June, the great galleon, the Queda Merchant... sails from Calicut to England.
We should meet her about here.
She's stuffed from keel to gunnels with treasure to the value of half million pounds.
Half...?
And we are to give her safe passage through the pirate seas.
By safe passage you mean we are to take her Captain?
No no, don't be greedy Mr Povey,
I grant that most of what's in her may... find it's way into our pockets but let's be fair, the King... poor gentleman, will expect something. But however we do it... must be done legal like and honest.
Stick to ways you are familiar with.
Why, you pox riddled villain I can be as honest as any man if I have the incentive.
Oh yes, me Lord Blayne.
Lord Blayne's name is not be mentioned among us Mr Povey, he's dead, so his crew and so's ours and there's none outside this... cabin that knows what became of them.
And if you all enjoy living, you will remember that.
Well.
Here's to our meeting with the Queda merchant.
- Queda merchant.
- Queda merchant.
- God bless her.
- Dios la bendiga.
Wind fresh from West North-West, sir.
Course Northeast by East, night dark but clear.
Very well, Mr. Mercy.
- North-East by East.
- North-East by East sir.
Missing down, it's Mr Boyle.
Lend a hand men.
Man down.
- What happened?
- He is dead.
If I find the man that's responsible for this, I'll hang him.
Fetch the yard and re-set it.
- What do you suppose happened?
- Someone's been tampering with this lines.
We are gathered together to pit farewell to a gallant seaman and a stout comrade.
Here was a man, shipmates...
Whose heart, the flinty mountains could not match.
Who always took better than he gave.
Whose benevolence was such...
The orphan's might and the rich man's gold alike found refuge in his pocket.
A jealous Providence has removed him from oust.
And I esteem it a privilege to commit his body to the deep.
We shall all mourn him.
Aye, we shall mourn him but take comfort me friends, we shall never see his like again.
Rest in peace. Pop him over.
Pity Mr Mercy, a great pity, but the ship's work must go on.
Move your gear into poor Mr Boyle's cabin, you will take his place as Master.
As Master.
Aye sir.
Why, Shadwell.
Don't tell me after all this time at sea...
My inward revolt is not for the movement of the vessel sir... is occasioned by the company I endure.
The manners I say nothing of sir.
But I am a Dorcestershire man... and when I find a common ship's master is the presumption... to copy himself the coat of arms of one of our best Dorcestershe families... can you wonder if I'm physically upset?
- Whose crest was he copying?
- Credit it or not sir, the Blayne crest.
Are you certain?
Perfectly sir, the crest in on Orange desk's.
Pardon me sir, I must join the captain.
He's inspecting a cask of pickled eels with Mr Lorenzo.
Well, Mr. Mercy.
Do your new duties include robbing my desk?
Shoot me Captain and your head goes with it, I'm here by the King's order.
So he did plant you on board.
You think he let a man sail with a crew of
Newgate cut-throats and not keep tabs on him?
And with good reason,.
If anything ever reaches the Palace this does and murder Captain.
Boyle's death was no accident.
By the way, what ship was sunk here, the Twelve Apostles?
Why the Twelve Apostles Mr Mercy?
Here's Blayne's ring, his name is on it, he commanded the Twelve Apostles.
That will make interesting telling in London when we get back Captain.
- If you get back.
- When I get back, for if I don't...
- On the other hand...
- On the other hand, what?
Since a man doesn't exactly grow rich in the King's pay...
A crooked rogue, so you have your price, how much?
- An equal share in what's buried here.
- Share that with you I'll be hanged if I do.
- You'll be hanged if you don't.
- Of all the slumocky blaggards.
And if you do share, Mr King's informer, what guarantee is there that you won't... still turn evidence to the Crown?
If I go in with you, I am equally guilty.
And if we are caught, we hang together but...
I can keep you from being caught.
What more could you ask?
You know Mr Mercy...
I wondered sometimes if ever I'd meet a more unscrupulous blaggard than myself.
And I have, but let's be sensible about this.
Who knows, we might be useful to each other one day.
In one way or another?
You've forgotten something, the ring.
So I have.
Listen in carefully because I want you to tell it in London if anything happens to me.
Kidd caught me in his cabin robbing his desk.
I lied to him, told him
I was a King's informant.
Good.
Yes but he didn't believe me, not one word, he just pretended to.
Oh, why didn't you shoot him?
Then he would give us no more trouble.
That's a pleasure I'm reserving for later.
He proves the liar I think him.
King's man or no, he betrayed an uncommon interest in the Twelve Apostles.
I didn't like it Mr Lorenzo,
I mean to find out why.
Why, you could've charged him of robbery and turned off to the yardarm and all legal and shipshape.
You would've been rid of him once and for all.
Let's not be impetuous Mr Povey.
He can't leave us, unless he swims.
It'll be rather amusing to find out what he does.
You rest easy, leave Mr Mercy to me.
Sail ho-ho.
Sail ho-ho.
- Have the bosun pipe the chorus.
- Pipe the chorus.
The Queda merchant, sure enough.
Can you make her out Captain Rawson?
She hasn't the cut of a buccaneer Your Excellency.
Much too tidy for that more like a King's ship.
Yet she has the lines of a merchantman.
- Have the longboat ready and manned.
- Longboat off board.
Stand by to putty a shot across her bows Mr Mercy.
Aye sir.
Number four gun crew stand by for action.
She's flying the English colors.
Perhaps she is our escort ship.
It was about here we were to meet, wasn't it?
Though we make it certain just the same.
Mr Gillian, see that all hands are at their stations.
Very good, sir.
Ready? Fire.
Well placed Mr Mercy.
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard.
Starboard she is sir.
You will come across with us in the longboat Mr Mercy.
And pay my compliments to all officers, who will dress as befitting a King's ship.
Aye sir.
Captain William Kidd of his Majesty's privateer Adventure at your service sir.
Mr Povey me surgeon,
Mr Mercy me master, Mr Lorenzo me navigator.
Welcome aboard gentlemen, I'm Captain Rawson.
I'm Lord Fallsworth, his Majesty's ambassador at the court of the Grand Mogul.
Your obedient servant sir.
I've been sent to give you convoy and we better make haste with our business.
These are unhealthy waters, the ship could be hove to, as I discovered a day or so ago.
You mean you sighted some of the pirate brotherhood?
More than that sir, we beat off two of them.
Avery and Culliford, out of Last Hope, some thirty leagues South of here.
Oh stop there, I nearly forgot, could you spare us some powder.
For we used more then expected in the action?
Why, all that you need sir, and welcome.
Mr Lorenzo here could attend to that then?
Oh Mr Gillian, take Mr Lorenzo below and see to that he gets what he wants.
- Aye aye sir.
- Captain.
I'll send for the master gunner, he'll take care of all your needs.
Mr Lorenzo.
Take this powder and put it in the longboat.
Aye aye sir.
Gentlemen, my daughter.
The Lady Anne Dunstan.
Captain Kidd, Mr Povey, Mr Mercy.
- Haven't we met before?
- I think not, My Lady.
You remind me of someone I've seen.
I think it impossible that we could have ever met.
Perhaps.
How do we proceed now, Captain?
Well, I'm instructed to give you protection past Madagascar.
And you'll be safe as long as we sail in company.
But Avery will be a wolf at your heels and if we are separated in darkness or storm...
And what would you advise then, sir?
Well...
I suppose we could take
Lord Fallsworth and Lady Anne... aboard the Adventure of Madagascar and then if we are separated and this...
- vessel should be taken...
- What about the treasure on board?
One silver chest alone.
A present to
His Majesty from the Grand Mogul.
Contains precious gems valued at more than a million pounds.
May I suggest, your Excellency...
Now, why not transfer the treasure chest with yourself and Lady Anne... on board the Adventure until we are out of danger?
- She is a King's ship.
- That is a great responsibility.
And although my instructions are that you are to trust me in all matters...
- I don't know if I could go so far as...
- What else can we do?
Three of them against us?
Or even two sir, we'd be helpless.
- It's the wisest course.
- I defer to your Excellency.
Now could we inspect the chests?
We could have them slung into our boats along with the...
- gear of Lord Fallsworth and Lady Anne.
- Why, certainly. This way Captain.
No trouble at all.
Hoist away.
Mr Povey.
I've sent for the manifest Captain.
You may check it against the content of this chest and give me your receipt, if you will.
Gladly, gladly.
Oh, there you are Mr Lorenzo.
Have you completed your business?
Almost sir.
Your people have been most kind Capitan Rawson.
There is only one detail left, it will not take a minute.
Finish it up then, we must be gone within the hour.
Yes Capitan.
- The manifest sir.
- Would you attend to that Mr Povey?
Thank you very much Captain.
Come Mr Lorenzo.
You've seen a lovely lady before this.
A tribute to your beauty Ma'am.
Did you finish your business below?
Yes Capitan Kidd.
Then we better be under way.
Mr Mercy, you will see Lord Fallsworth and the Lady Anne into the boat.
Aye sir.
Make way for the longboat.
You will have the luggage Mr Lorenzo.
I apologize My Lady for our poor accommodation.
But me valet Shadwell will see that you are made comfortable.
A pleasure to have your Ladyship aboard, if you will follow me please.
Why hasn't it happened?
- She's blown up.
- Someone must touch over her magazine.
Send down some boats at once sir.
You ask me to risk men near that?
- Let it go.
- Captain.
Papa.
Excuse me My Lady.
Your father, may I say how sorry I am.
The captain is requested that you take your meals in the main cabin.
Oh no Shadwell, I can't bear to face those men. I can't.
I quite understand My Lady.
But the Captain's orders are orders.
Shadwell, you must help me, there's no one else I can trust.
What can I do My Lady? I'm only a servant.
Where can I turn?
I'm so confused and frightened.
I keep thinking of my father and the others lost back there.
But on this ship wherever
I go, those horrible staring men.
Like Lorenzo, who's always standing behind me, beside me.
Last night there was a tapping on the door.
When I opened it there he was, the evil smiling face of his.
We might've been better along with those pirates you fought a few days ago.
Pirates Milady? We fought no pirates.
Well, my father said Captain Kidd told...
Shadwell, what manner of ship this is?
My father was killed deliberately, I'm sure of it.
That's why I can't bear to face your Captain, I'd accuse him.
There's a man on board My Lady, a gentleman.
Whom I know you can trust.
- Mr Mercy?
- Yes my Lady.
Shadwell, I know I've met or seen him before no matter how he denies it.
His name isn't Mercy, who is he?
All I really know is My Lady, he is no friend of the Captain's.
Perhaps if I ask him, he'll, shall I?
- Oh yes, will you please?
- Yes, My Lady.
I'm asking you again very nice...
My dear Capitan.
Your fancy manners do not impress me Mr Lorenzo.
- When do we divide the gold?
- In London, not before.
Then look Capitan,
I will make a bargain with you.
A bargain? Everybody wants to bargain with me, you and Mercy.
Farther and farther, who do you think I am, a stinking sausage merchant?
What kind of a bargain?
The girl.
All my life I have dreamed of a beautiful woman like that.
Give me half of my dinero now and you can split the rest between you.
If you will let me have her.
Five on him, he's smitten with love again.
I want her and I'm going to take her.
Whether I like it or not?
With all this treasure on board the crew is like a barrel of hot gunpowder...
All that is needed is a word in the right ears.
Do you mean mutiny? You're a witness.
- He is inciting the crew to mutiny.
- No, no, no, no, Capitan.
I was only joking.
You have a very nasty way of joking Mr Lorenzo.
As for the girl, I've my own plans for her and they do not include you.
Get out.
- Who is it?
- Adam Mercy.
Mister I...
- Thank you for coming, Mr Mercy, I...
- My name is Adam Blayne.
Son of Lord Blayne?
I knew it, I knew.
What are you doing on this ship?
My father was killed and accused of piracy.
- Few people believe that Lord Blayne...
- The King did it.
That's why I went to sea and turned pirate three years ago, that's why I'm on this ship.
I knew that someday I'd come upon the truth.
And you have?
It was Captain Kidd who killed your father, wasn't it?
Adam I am no fool, he did the same thing to my father.
The fat butcher.
It's taken me three years to track him down, three years of degradation.
Now I got him where
I want him and he knows it.
- You mean he knows who you are?
- He knows something.
That's why you didn't get me to know you, why you avoided me.
If Kidd knew we shared this he'd kill you with... as little compunction as he means to kill me, if I let him.
What can I do to help?
There must be something.
Forget everything you've seen on this ship.
Play up to him, be friendly.
That way you'll be safe.
Now, when you get back to London, no matter what has happened to me...
Go to the Lord of the Admiralty and the King.
You'll be doing me a great service as well as yourself.
I will Adam, I promise.
We're going to have trouble with Lorenzo.
Speaking as a lion who's exciting the tiger.
His blood is getting too rich for him.
He'd be the better for a bleeding.
Things are getting a bit complicated me Lord.
The King may accept the elimination of the Queda merchant as an accident.
Maybe even the sudden demise of Lord Fallsworth.
But what about the Lady?
You said you had plans for her, do they include...
Mr Povey, the little dear is as safe with me as if she was me daughter.
My passion is power and gold, since she suspects nothing...
I'll deliver her to His Majesty along with his share of the Queda Merchant's goods...
I'll weep appropriately over the untimely demise of her Pa.
Receive the grateful thanks of me Sovereign and a peerage is mine.
Mi lord.
That is your will but that's what I'll have.
And neither man nor devils shall stop me.
- Shadwell.
- Señorita, Milady. Do not be alarmed.
Now that she knows who I am and what kind of a ship she's on.
I think we can count on her to keep ahead.
You stay here till I come off watch.
Help.
Shadwell.
Use your head Mr Povey.
Luck with us tonight, which of either them would you like to see survive?
Mr Mercy, you did well to protect her.
- Are you alright sir?
- Yes, I'm alright, look after Lady Anne.
Adam, what's the matter?
My medallion is gone, has the Blayne crest on it.
Blayne?
Perhaps I can find it for you sir.
No, it must've come off just before
Lorenzo went through the port.
- Shadwell, take Lady Anne to her cabin.
- Please Adam, I can't go in there.
You must Anne, this is serious, it involves you.
Remember, no matter what tricks he tries, you've never seen me before and you don't know who I am.
- Shadwell I think...
- Don't worry about me sir.
He never could get anything out of me and he never will.
It's the only way you'll be safe.
Shadwell will watch out of you.
What about you Adam? What will he do?
The same thing he's done with the others, if he gets a chance.
Oh Adam.
Don't worry Anne, at least I know what to expect.
Go now.
Shadwell, if anything does happen, remember you're to stand by Lady Anne and...
- see that she gets safely to London.
- I'll stake my life on it sir.
- I know you will.
- Be careful Adam.
Please be careful.
Come My Lady.
- He's no King's man.
- Who is he then?
Tomorrow we put into the lagoon for water, while the crew is getting it on board... you and me and Mr Mercy is going to the cave.
You aren't taking him there?
I've a peculiar humor to watch my clever young friend's face when we dig up that chest.
Sweet dreams.
Dig fast Mr Mercy, we haven't got forever.
Who might this be?
Perhaps a man that asked too many questions.
Gently now Mr Mercy, you've came on something.
- So it was the Twelve Apostles, hey Captain?
- Yes it was Mr Mercy.
Open it up.
- Blayne's.
- Blayne's.
He was a brave seaman but foolish.
Did you happen to know him Mr Mercy?
- I've heard of him.
- I thought perhaps you had.
This... is yours, isn't it?
I traded a ring for it.
- One of Avery's men.
- Yes.
When I encountered Lord Blayne at sea
I did my simple duty as a loyal subject.
A pity he turned pirate and traitor to his King.
Liar.
He's meat for the sharks now Mr Povey.
The tide closes this place in half an hour, we've nothing more to fear.
Yes you have Captain, Lady Anne.
It's a long voyage home Mr
Povey and anything might happen.
Naturally her Ladyship is still very distressed sir.
In the midst of life we are in death Shadwell.
- Although me heart...
- My heart sir.
My heart bleeds...
Confound you Shadwell, you've drove the thought right out of me... and it was an uncommon pretty one.
- I'm sure of that sir.
- Go to her at once.
Tell her she can't mourn forever and I shall expect... her to take her meals in the main cabin with the rest of us.
Very well sir.
Poor lad.
We turned just in time to see him go over the edge.
Searched for an hour, never came out.
Well, here's to him.
Wherever he is. You filling ill?
Yes sir.
I'll go to my cabin with your permission.
If you wish, it's been quite a trying voyage.
What with one little thing or another but bear up, you'll soon be home again.
I warned Adam not to go.
- No one could've stopped him.
- Was cold bloody, planned, deliberate.
The same will happen to her Ladyship, unless we can...
Adam.
Adam, how did you?
If he finds you on board sir?
- I've come back for Lady Anne.
- Oh, thank you sir.
I've been hanging on the rudder chain since dark waiting for the turn of the watch.
The jolly-boat is moored astern.
I've waited along side, it's secured right down this port.
Bart, get in it then, flip at under the main cabin.
Well now, get me some dry clothes.
Shadwell, where is the captain?
In his own cabin with Mr Povey, sir.
Examining the silver chest they brought back on board sir.
My father's chest.
Shadwell, Kidd doesn't suspect you.
Tell Lady Anne to get some things together and when the coast is clear you come back for me.
Yes, sir.
- Master.
- Aye sir.
Rouse out both watches at daybreak, we'll weigh on the morning tide.
Aye sir.
Adam.
Kidd doesn't suspect Shadwell, he's staying on board and he'll be evidence for us in London.
Bart has a small boat moored astern, we'll row ashore.
Then where Adam?
Two days journey overland is the pirate town of Last Hope.
It's the most lawless place on earth but I've friends there.
- Somehow they'll find us a ship for England.
- England?
- Now.
- Come on.
Sit down in the bow.
Goodbye My Lady, goodbye My Lord. Godspeed.
I'll see you in England.
- Ahoy there, who's in that boat now?
- Come on.
Come on.
Fire.
Thank you... melord.
Fire.
Down the longboat.
Bart.
Bart.
Hold on to me.
Take her away.
- They're as dead as a mackerel.
- He's gone through.
Now, I guess that's the end of them Captain.
And good riddance. Back to the ship boys.
If you are thinking what I think you're thinking my friend, forget it.
There's the little matter of a letter I've left in London.
Spoilsport.
Captain William Kidd.
Greetings Captain, what news have you brought me from the Indian seas?
By your leave Your Majesty, both good and ill, but mostly very good indeed.
I returned by way of the American colonies Sire.
So I understood. With the main points of your voyage, I am familiar.
I wonder if you could enlighten me... about the affair of the Queens godchild Lady
Anne Dunstan and your ship-master Mr Mercy?
Oh that poor impetuous fellow Sire... inveigled that bud of innocence he did, into running away with him.
And catching him red handed in defense of me very life I was force to dispatch them both.
Rest in peace.
Tell me Captain about the treasure and the Queda merchant.
Unfortunate Sire, most unfortunate.
We shipped that chest when that ship blew and all souls went heavenward.
Rest in peace to them, ditto.
I see.
And after Twelve Apostles and Lord
Blayne, did you encounter any trace?
Nay Sire, I can only hope that the weight of his sins sank both him and his ship.
I see, then how do you explain this?
Whose might that be Your Majesty?
My officers found it on your ship at
Plymouth after you left for London.
It bears the Blayne crest with which I believe you are not unfamiliar.
I've always thought that
Mr Povey, me surgeon, a very wily... fellow indeed was hiding something from me.
Hiding it in a secret locker in your cabin Captain?
I hope Mr Povey has a proper explanation Sire.
Mr Povey was killed three days ago defending it... with his dying oath he swore it was not his.
Perhaps Shadwell, me valet slipped it aboard.
Might it not have come from a Madagascar cave Captain?
Time will get me clear about all this Your Majesty.
Enough of your lies.
Look.
A nightmare.
Pity you overlooked Last Hope Captain.
We stood on the headland with my friend Avery and watched you sail by.
May it please Your Majesty I accuse this man of piracy and murder.
Was ever a gentleman so misfortunate?
Lock him up in Newgate.
He's to be held for the next session of the court, there to be tried for his life.
Hands off me, you scum.
All I've done was to the credit and for the honor and glory of England.
So here's me bequest, to them what hunts what I have hid... and to their sons' sons, down trough the endless corridors of time...
Greed, that spawns murder.
Hatred, that corrodes the soul.
Ambition, the foulest strumpet of all.
Hey Jack, Jack hey, sell me that hang-rope for sixpence, will you?
Save your money me lad.
You can have it all for nothing if you'd only step up here and wear it.
Hurry up Jack, can't wait forever.
Captain Kidd is dead
My Lord Blayne, his account is closed.
Now, in what manner can I atone for the injustice I worked upon your father?
Offer you a First Sea Lord? What you suggest?
We have a fine frigate of fifty guns.
Commissioned for American waters Sire.
That we sought of naming, the Lady Anne.
It shall be a wedding gift to you from the Crown... for your loyalty and service to King and Country.
NARRATOR:
At the forks of the Ohio stands an American city, a colossus of steel, whose mills and furnaces bring forth bone and sinew for a nation.
Not so long ago a lonely outpost guarded this very spot.
It was called Fort Pitt.
It stood at the edge of an unknown land, one of a line of forts that ran from Virginia to the Great Lakes, marking the end of the known and the beginning of the unknown.
Civilization was east of the Allegheny Mountains.
Conquest, opportunity and death lay to the west.
All around Fort Pitt was a vast forest, always beautiful, always dangerous.
Men came into it seeking many things.
Some for wealth, some for refuge some for freedom.
But to the Indian, all men came as invaders.
Wars for survival between red men and white threatened to sweep away these little forts.
Yet men kept coming west.
Some to build their own fortunes, even at the price of Indian wars.
Others to build a nation, even at the price of their own lives.
These are the unconquered, who push ever forward the frontiers of man's freedom.
But history sometimes chooses its heroes and heroines from strange places.
For one, the hope of freedom was born at Old Bailey in London, in the year 1763.
Prisoner at the bar.
You have been found guilty of the most heinous crime, of murder.
It is my duty to pass upon you the sentence which the law enjoins.
Abigail Martha Hale, the sentence of this court is...
My lord.
Woman, be still.
My lord, hear me.
My brother was ill of fever when the press-gang broke in to take him.
I helped him fight to be free.
In that fight, an impressing officer of the Royal Navy was killed.
My brother was killed too, my lord.
The prisoner is here to receive sentence.
The sentence of this court is that you be taken from this place to a lawful prison and thence to a place of execution.
And that you there be hanged by the neck until you are dead.
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Come.
One word more, by the gracious generosity of Our Sovereign Lord,
King George the Third, it is in my power to offer you the King's mercy.
Instead of execution, you may be transported to His Majesty's colonies in North America.
Not to die, my lord?
And to serve not less than 14 years as an indentured slave, to be sold at auction to the highest bidder.
Slavery in the colonies or the gallows here.
Speak up, girl, which is it to be?
Slavery, my lord.
Get the blood in your cheeks.
You'll fetch a better price at Norfolk tomorrow.
Mr. Leach, you won't sell me away from my husband, will you?
You'll sell according to your indentures.
Seven year, l'll be free and get me a bit of land.
And maybe even a strong wife.
LEACH: Get along, get along.
Me, l'll get me bought by a nice rich widow and marry myself free.
I ain't a rich widow, but l'm willing.
Ain't you got a wife already, Tom?
Wife. I'm serving time for all four of them.
Break your ranks and save your shanks.
Our land of opportunity.
Jeremy, how old shall l look in 14 years?
Fourteen years older, of course.
LEACH: Here, here, have a care there.
Have a care.
MAN: Hold onto the slate.
MAN 2: Make fast to the pin rail.
MAN 3: Ease that on the deck.
And at ease.
Some sort of chopping instrument.
LEACH: Stand by your braces.
Let go of the last one.
Jeremy, put it back before the owner sees you.
GARTH: The owner has seen you.
Hand me that tomahawk.
Tomahawk?
I was just remarking to this young lady...
Convicts should know the punishment for stealing.
Captain.
Well, he didn't steal it.
No, well, perhaps...
Who are you?
My daughter, sir.
The devoted daughter of Jeremy John Love.
Jeremy, l'm not your daughter.
No, not in fact, but in spirit.
You seem a gentleman of discernment, sir.
Tell me, can you always spot the queen?
I believe so.
Excellent, I've heard...
No, no.
Don't go away, my dear.
Jeremy, please.
You show a taste for entertainment, sir, entertainment with a dash of risk.
Well?
Well, sir, observe your queen is now between two knaves, thus.
But can you tell me where the queen is hiding now?
And if l do?
The stake is yours to name, sir.
A pound.
A pound it is.
Put it up.
Oh, well, l seldom carry large sums of money upon my...
You have other assets.
Perhaps a kiss from your daughter-in-spirit.
Jeremy, l won't be...
Keep your hair on, he can't win.
MAN: Man the mizzen top-sail sheets.
A golden sovereign.
Gallant risk, sir.
Now, sir.
Now, can you tell me where the queen is hiding?
Yes. Up the sleeve of a cheat who is about to get 30 lashes.
Thirty?
You wouldn't have a man of his age whipped.
His age hasn't improved his honesty or yours.
Slave driver.
Wait.
I'll give you the kiss.
You're not giving it, l won it.
MAN: He's got her anchored all right.
Another cheat.
I paid you.
You can do better.
Slave driver.
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Garth.
This woman for sale?
Yes, Mr. Garth.
They're all for sale.
Indentured servant?
No, sir. Felon.
Felon?
It ain't deep in her character, Mr. Garth.
She's good manners, gentle, sweet.
Fit for all kinds of housework.
I'll buy her.
I won't be sold to this man.
What's her price?
Mr. Leach, the judge said public auction.
LEACH: Hold your tongue.
She's right.
We'll have an auction right here.
Gentlemen, would any of you care to bid against me for his girl?
MAN: Not me.
I don't hold much with slavery.
That red hair could change a man's mind.
I'm starting at £20.
£20 is bid for
Abigail Martha Hale.
Offering 14 years of servitude.
Let them see your face, girl.
Going once, going twice.
For the third and last time...
HOLDEN: And sixpence.
FERGUS: Pardon?
Man, you've an eye like an eagle.
But l dinnae ken your way of throwing.
Did you say something, sir?
Yes, l said, "And sixpence."
Lend me your bodkin, Fergus.
It's an Indian knife throw.
Captain Holden has a reputation for joking.
Make your sale.
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Garth.
Going to Mr. Garth for...
You heard my bid?
LEACH: Yes, sir,
£20 and sixpence.
Would your humor desert you,
Captain Holden, at £50?
MAN 1: £50, did you hear that?
MAN 2: What do you know!
£50 for this likely servant maid.
Strong and willing.
Do l hear another bid?
And sixpence.
LEACH: And sixpence.
£50 and sixpence.
LEACH: Do l hear £55?
Cash on the barrel.
Cash on the barrel.
Try another.
£50 and sixpence, l'm bid.
And sixpence.
£60 and sixpence...
That's better.
He must be very rich or very interested.
He hasn't even looked at me.
£60 and sixpence for this rare gem.
Smile, you little scut.
Do l hear another bid?
GARTH: Yes.
And sixpence.
LEACH: It's £65 and sixpence.
Hey, Chris, the game's getting a wee bit rough.
Here's your coat.
Do l hear £70? You will not see the likes of this maid in all His Majesty's colonies.
You seem to want this girl.
The Ohio country won't be a healthy place for a white woman when the Indians get these toys you're bringing them.
Usual trade goods.
Usual?
What you've got aboard the brig Minerva and the ship Paragon?
It might pay you to mind your own business.
I found that out from one of your Senecas on the Catawba Trail.
You met one of the bad shots.
That one will never learn to shoot any better.
And sixpence.
I hear £70 and another sixpence.
Have a closer look, gentlemen.
Skin soft as satin.
Cheerful as a meadowlark.
MAN 1: Muskets.
MAN 2: That's guns in there.
They're all new.
Even this ship is loaded with your usual trade goods.
Indians don't trade furs for Bibles.
They don't trade for bond slaves, either.
What are your plans for her?
Field hand on your plantation?
I apologize for Mr. Garth, ma'am.
In Virginia we use dirt to grow tobacco and bury our dead.
We don't like your kind of dirt, Mr. Garth.
MAN 3: Watch out.
No, gentlemen, no.
Not on my ship.
You are quite right,
Captain Brooks.
His purse.
Perhaps someday he'll come west of the Alleghenies.
Dueling code is very different in the Ohio country.
£70 and sixpence is bid, gentlemen, for this dainty little package.
Look at her slender form, the tilt of her head.
You, sir, would you care to put in a bid, sir?
No, thank you.
I've never had to buy trouble.
Here's my bid,
£103. A Turk's ransom.
Jeremy, l'm frightened.
A hundred quid would frighten the wings off an angel.
And sixpence.
I'll double that tomorrow at Norfolk.
Cash on the barrel, Mr. Garth.
Is that yours?
No, mine's in the Captain's strongbox.
He's right. Cash is the law.
Make the sale.
£103 and sixpence, once, twice.
Sold to Captain Holden for £103...
And sixpence.
Sorry, Mr. Garth.
Quite a price for a rose of Old Bailey.
Here's your bonnet.
Have the bill of sale ready in the morning.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
My dear Captain, allow me to present my ward.
I hope you had a very pleasant voyage, ma'am.
Well...
Chris...
Chris, a loony man would seem wise alongside of you.
Why did ye do it?
Garth is bad medicine,
Fergus.
She'll be safer with him than with your promised bride tomorrow when she sees yon red-headed purchase you just made.
Aye. Diana.
MAN: Land ho!
MAN 1: Haul away on the...
MAN 2: Clear tire.
Clear tire.
Your longboat's making fast, sir.
Does it carry a young lady armed with a musket?
The ship's agent brought this aboard, sir.
Thank you.
Oh, will you have my luggage lowered to the longboat?
Certainly, sir.
From the impatient bride?
No, from John Fraser.
Pittsburgh blacksmith.
Pittsburgh?
Little village in Virginia.
Listen to this.
"Trouble's busting everywhere.
"When you get yours, if you ain't killed nobody,
"meet me at the Peakestown Fair."
John must have dipped his pen in applejack.
He can't have known you're getting married.
If you'll sign
Mistress Hale's papers, sir.
Whose? Oh.
Have the notary certify these, then give them to the girl.
Yes, sir. She's on deck.
If he likes sugarplums, you look just like one.
He's probably married, with six children.
Stop babbling.
Just get him to buy me and l'll have you riding in your own carriage.
Love accomplishes all things, my dear.
For instance, for luck.
Jeremy, it's a gold piece.
Uh-huh.
King Charles double guinea.
It was given to my mother by a prince of the blood.
There he is.
Well, go to him. Go to him.
Keep your gold in your fist, your tongue in your cheek, and don't be too forward, and not too backward, either.
MAN: Pick up, you're slacking that line.
Good morning, Captain Holden.
Good morning, Miss...
Well, l'm all ready.
Yes. I see you are.
Bend your bonnets.
Do we go now?
I'm sorry, Miss...
Abby.
Miss Abby.
But l'm not taking you.
You're free.
But didn't you buy me?
Oh, yes, l bought you...
MAN: Watch yourself.
Stand clear, you.
And now l've set you free.
ABBY: You mean really free?
HOLDEN: Yes. Leach will give you your papers.
I'm very grateful, but l won't accept my freedom.
You won't?
I owe you £103 and sixpence and l intend to work for you until it's paid.
Oh, not for me.
You're much too pretty to pass the porridge on my honeymoon.
Your honeymoon? But...
You're married?
I will be within the week.
Goodbye, Abby.
Then why did you buy me?
What?
Why did you buy me?
Oh, to see if sixpence could poison a snake.
Oh. You bought me because you don't like him.
Well, here's a lucky piece to brighten your opinion of me.
It's a King Charles double guinea.
What did l do with it?
Oh, l see.
I didn't steal it.
I see your hand was quicker than my eye.
Keep it.
More freight for the longboat.
MAN: Aye, aye, sir.
Hold tight.
Take it easy, men.
You've got a passenger on it.
Easy on that cargo sling.
Keep it clear of the shroud.
Chris.
HOLDEN: No.
Doesn't look like it to me.
DIANA:
Who's the girl with him?
Don't know. Very pretty.
MAN 1: Flip the toddle.
Clear that gear.
MAN 2: On deck.
Overhaul the cabling.
Batten the hooks down.
Pull the hatch ladder.
Watch your footing on the gangway.
There's Martha.
There she is.
Goodbye, George.
See you in Jamestown.
Land never looked better.
WOMAN: I'm so glad to be home, l could walk on air.
Hello, Bone.
I'll sign these later.
Very good, sir.
What'd you bring from Pittsburgh?
Two wagons of this kind of stuff.
Injuns ain't hunting.
What's wrong?
Gun trading's been stopped.
Who stopped it?
Indian Commissioner.
He wants you to meet him at Peakestown.
Looks like the pot's started to boil.
What's Pontiac say?
Says the Delawares will join and the Shawnees and the Chippewas.
He ain't sure about the Wyandots.
They'll come in when their powder horns are full.
Steady there, steady.
Back that tray up,
'tis powder.
Hang on.
MAN: Take up the slack in the quarter line.
Get up, Leach, and let me sign these.
Yes, sir, Mr. Garth.
Wicked waste of money.
By you?
Captain Holden setting that girl free.
Yes, very wasteful.
How would you like to sell all your bond slaves to Mr. Bone, here?
Bond slaves?
I got no use for...
Say, £400?
Well... Why, sold.
All except...
Except no one.
But that girl is free.
You're sailing next week.
Who'd know?
Double-selling a bond slave is a hanging offense.
Here's a mink for you, so the rope won't scratch your neck.
Mr. Leach, Captain Holden said you'd give me my papers.
Well...
He said that?
Yes, he set me free.
Free? That's carrying a joke too far.
What is?
First he pretends to buy the girl, then he pretends to set her free.
He did buy me.
If he bought a girl as pretty as you, he'd never set her free.
Mr. Leach?
I'm sure the gentleman meant no harm.
But he'd have told me.
He didn't have the courage.
It is rather a grim joke.
You bought me.
No. Bone.
Where're you going?
He'll sell the others at Peakestown Fair.
You're not for sale.
I won't go with him.
You'll go all right.
I ain't bad company.
Get the furs aboard and the slaves ashore.
Start west before night.
What's the matter, Jason?
You're not singing.
I guess there ain't much singing left in me,
Master Chris.
Just thinking.
You're thinking, too, Diana?
Why? Haven't l been talking?
Yes, you've been talking, but about dogs and colts and cotton.
About most everything except us.
Well, the mosquitoes are glad l'm back anyway.
Oh, l'm glad you're back, Chris.
So is your brother, Harold.
Poor Hal.
Poor?
Well, we can't both have you, Diana.
Chris, when l look into your eyes, l don't see myself there.
You must be a little blind.
I see horizons, ranges of uncrossed mountains, the unknown.
You belong to that, Chris, the way an eagle belongs to the sky.
But l'm different.
No, you're not.
Let me tell you what l see in your eyes.
No.
You won't like the view.
It doesn't go beyond the walls of Holden Hall.
What are you trying to say?
Something l've been trying to tell you in everything but words.
Hal and l are married.
You married Holden Hall and £20,000 a year.
I married the things l want, Chris.
Where are we, Jason?
Just passing Blount's Landing,
Master Chris.
Put me ashore.
Chris, come home and meet your brother.
I don't care to inherit the brand of Cain.
He set aside £20,000 for you.
I paid £100 for a little thief aboard ship.
I think you were overpriced.
I was never yours to sell.
I guess you're right.
Your wedding present's in those trunks.
There's a green dress with all the fluff to go with it, designed by Forgel,
Madame Pompadour's dressmaker.
Just right for you.
Cost £187.
Here are the keys.
You'll find someone more worthy than l am to wear them.
Some squaw, west of the Alleghenies.
Swing those trunks ashore.
Yes, sir, Master Chris.
Oh, Chris, you'll forget me in no time.
You'll forget that in no time.
Just pile that stuff right here.
I'll get a wagon.
Yes, sir, Master Chris.
Take me with you,
Master Chris.
You're not mine to take.
I'll miss you, Jason.
You taught me most of what l know.
You might have taught me a little more about women.
Goodbye, old friend.
MAN: Now, while balancing himself on one foot with nothing between him and the ground but this knife-sharp wire, he will cut in two a paper tube held in the mouths of these fair young damsels.
Don't worry if he misses, he told me they were two-faced.
This gentleman...
Hi, there, John Fraser.
Ain't you a long way from Pittsburgh?
Five days and 150 miles uphill both ways.
...that far-famed monster of Madagascar, the one-horned Boukabekabus.
Two, sir.
Thank you.
With the hide of a bull, the head of a unicorn, and the wisdom of a prophet, he has astonished the crowned heads of Europe and now can be seen for three days only right here in Peakestown.
Hey, blacksmith, think you could hammer shoes on that?
Pittsburgh, he'd be a house pet.
Cider. Cider.
Fresh, sweet cider.
Hard as a rock.
Cider here.
...hazard and risk for your education and recreation.
Neptune's loveliest daughter, she has the face of a female and the body of a fish.
She has lured, my friends, many a brave sea captain to his destruction.
Now, you with the spinning wheel there, don't go away. Come on in.
Come in, folks.
You've never seen anything like it before.
You'll never see anything like it again.
Scales on her tail and...
Thank you very much, sir.
Scales on her tail and seaweed in her hair.
The greatest exhibit at the Peakestown Fair.
HOLDEN:
You can't take her home to your wife, John Fraser.
Chris. Chris Holden.
I've been looking all over for you.
By gollys, how are you?
Did you expect to find me in there with the mermaid?
Aw, shucks. I wasn't...
Pile your loot in the back and climb aboard.
Say, ain't you traveling kind of fancy?
What did you bring back, the London Bridge?
Well, a green dress for a bride and women's doodads, which l expect to swap for trade goods.
Well, get over.
Yep. I heard about her.
Chris, you wasn't cut out to marry no Tidewater lady and just rusticate.
I don't know what the good Lord was about when he made a female out of a perfectly good rib.
We'll tote your doodads over to Fort Pitt.
Officers' wives will pay more for them.
That's quite a speech for you.
But you didn't bring me out here just to tell me that.
What's going on?
Trouble, Chris.
You can smell it as far as a flea can smell a dog.
Keep this covered.
Where did you get this?
Off an Injun that aimed a mite too high.
The Indian Commissioner seen it?
Sir William?
No, not yet.
I kept it for you.
MAN: Going twice.
Sold to the gent in the butternut vest for £14.
Pay the notary, mister.
He'll give you your papers.
Put your hat on, lad.
It's your sweat l'm buying, not your spirit.
You don't have to bow and scrape to me.
Take this one for £1.
He'll keep the crows off your field.
All right, come along.
Let's see.
Say, you. Yeah.
I'm looking to buy a wife for my son.
Oh, wife.
Here, young lady.
A buxom lass from Lancashire.
She can outwork a horse.
Kind and loving as a dove.
Made a little mistake, that's all.
She'll make your son a fine, affectionable wife.
What do you say, Son?
Joshua, what's the matter with you?
Ma, buy me that one.
She ain't for sale.
Get back on the wagon.
Why did you tell me to stand here and smile?
For bait. Get going.
BONE: Now, lady, what's your bid?
WOMAN: Let me talk to this girl private.
Look, Abby, there's Captain Holden going into the tavern.
BONE: Here you are, folks, this young fella's as strong as a goat and smart as a fox.
I'd rather look at the devil himself.
BONE: Takes to work like a duck to water.
What do you say?
Colonel Washington is here too, Chris.
I thought maybe you and him might get the Indian Commissioner to...
What's biting you?
You ain't going to buy a bond slave, are you?
That girl looks like one l've already bought.
It is, Captain.
The moment you left, she came to me.
I use her for drawing crowds.
And l thought she was only a thief.
Hello, Chris,
Mr. Garth. Mr. Lee.
Colonel Washington.
You said to fetch him, George.
You know the Indian Commissioner,
Sir William Johnson.
How are you, Captain?
Sir William.
I haven't seen you since the Indians chased us off Braddock's Field.
What's the matter?
You look as though they'd just caught up with you.
Mr. Garth was just enlightening me on the manners and morals of bond slaves.
My wife was a bond slave, you know, Captain Holden.
One of my teachers was an indentured convict, Chris.
Fine man. Never could teach me to spell.
Coming?
Yes, sir.
I'll join you inside,
Sir William.
BUYER: Fourteen.
Only £14 for as handy a couple as you'll find this side of Cape Henry.
I don't want both.
I bid £14 for the man.
The woman is yours, mister, for £6 more.
A woman's no good in my fields.
Oh, Ben, hold me close.
I'm frightened.
Who'll say £20 for them both? You?
MAN: Not me.
You?
Then it's £14 for the man.
Sold to this gentleman here.
Now, what am l bid for the woman?
Don't sell us apart,
Mr. Bone.
You'd be apart if you was serving your terms in prison.
Now, what am l bid for this?
Who'll say six for the woman?
It's not human to sell a man away from his wife, Mr. Bone.
Shut your yap.
Don't buy him alone, sir.
Please.
I don't buy women.
But she's his wife.
Keep quiet.
You never said they're man and wife, fella.
They're slaves, ain't they?
I'm not breaking up a family.
The girl's right.
Get down there.
Don't whip her because of me, Mr. Bone.
Keep out of this.
Don't worry about me, Maggie.
Get on down there.
Take over, Art.
Don't go away, gentlemen.
Don't go away.
Come on, we can see over the top.
Here's a good, strong field hand for your plantation.
Strong of back.
Strong of arm.
What am l bid.
Do l hear £10?
You'll get it now.
Please don't.
MAN: Hold your tongue.
You've been asking for this.
It's time to learn who's your master.
Maybe it is, Bone.
She spiked a sale.
Loose her.
MAN: Ain't they gonna tan her?
WOMAN:
They're taking her down.
Fix your dress in the tent, Abby.
Are you out of your mind?
You said to gentle her.
Flogging collects a crowd.
Chris Holden's here.
Has he seen her?
Yes.
Sell what you can and get going for Pittsburgh.
He hurt you.
I'm all right.
I'm sorry about this.
Why did you stop him?
I hoped you would forgive and forget.
Slavery hasn't taught me forgiveness.
Or gratitude.
I'm grateful for what you've done.
I can do more.
Would you help me get away?
Where?
There isn't a town in these colonies big enough to hide that red hair of yours.
Some try for the west.
The west?
You've never seen a doe dragged down by a wolf pack or a white woman when an Indian war party had done with her.
You don't know what freedom's worth until you lose it.
Isn't worth much against a Shawnee torture stake.
Hanging in England is quick, Abby.
Is it worse than
14 years of bondage with Bone?
It doesn't have to be bondage or Bone.
GARTH: Hannah.
Mamaultee bring word from my father.
Well?
Guyasuta say to Garth,
Pontiac at Wolf Creek.
Hannah, look after this girl.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
White one. Pretty.
Who are you?
A bond slave.
He no look at you like bond slave.
His.
Who are you?
His wife.
For years, gentlemen, l've had the Indians' friendship.
I sometimes think that only an Irishman can really understand the red man.
Now, maybe l'm getting old, but l still know the signs.
There's a cloud of trouble coming down over the Ohio with the sound of war drums in it.
I've heard them before.
And l know that closing your ears to them can cost you your scalp.
What's behind it,
Sir William?
Mr. Carroll, when old enemies like the Ottawas, the Shawnees, and the Senecas meet together in council, the thread's off the bobbin.
Perhaps just a meeting to bury the hatchet.
In somebody's skull.
Do you think there's war in this, Colonel Washington?
The whole frontier's a powder keg.
And those two gentlemen were almost the fuse.
Mr. Mason and Mr. Dixon, the London astronomers, have been running a survey to settle Pennsylvania's boundary line and her claim to Pittsburgh and the Ohio country.
Pittsburgh, gentlemen, is in Virginia.
You can see for yourselves.
But, Brother Lee,
Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania and the whole
Ohio Territory is...
Mine.
Yours, Mr. Garth?
Yes.
I'm no surveyor, gentlemen, but the Allegheny runs here and the Monongahela.
Here's Pittsburgh.
Colonel Washington wants this territory for Virginia.
Mr. Andrews thinks it's in Pennsylvania.
But l hold deeds to it from the Indians.
The Indians cannot deed lands, Mr. Garth.
Not by law.
Whose law?
Pennsylvania's? Virginia's?
The King's law.
The King's law moves with the King's muskets.
And there are very few King's muskets west of the Alleghenies.
There's only bear, beaver and muskrat, and they don't need boundary lines.
Mr. Garth.
The very heavens need boundary lines.
Mr. Mason and l have measured the distance from Earth to Mars.
There are no savages between
Earth and Mars, Mr. Dixon.
There are 10,000 red hot ones between here and the Ohio.
And it's no place for surveyors or settlers.
You're there.
I rule it.
You can't rule part of Pennsylvania.
Nor Virginia.
Nobody rules it until this survey is completed.
And l regret to inform you that the Mason and Dixon Line has been stopped.
Stopped?
When?
How could it be stopped?
WASHINGTON: Mr. Mason.
Stopped rather thoroughly at Dunkard's Creek by a band of painted aborigines.
It must have been a hunting party.
Why should Indians stop a survey?
Why?
To hide the movement of war parties across the Ohio trail.
ALL: War parties?
The Senecas, the Ottawas,
Delawares, Shawnees...
You mean a general uprising?
MAN: Have they powder and lead?
War parties?
Is that possible,
Sir William?
So possible that we have forbidden the sale of firearms to the Indians.
But, Sir William, no one could bring those tribes together.
I think there is someone,
Mr. Garth.
Who?
Pontiac.
Pontiac?
The Ottawa chief?
Pontiac's a friend of the white man.
Which white man?
Those who stay east of the Alleghenies.
Mr. Garth has just been in England trying to get a law passed prohibiting settlement west of the Allegheny.
He wants the whole fur empire to himself.
Settlers will never be safe west of the mountains.
Why, their homes are there.
Their graves will be there, unless you call them back.
Mr. Garth.
Those people will never abandon a settlement like Pittsburgh.
I'm sorry,
Colonel Washington.
I know you selected that site yourself, but after all, a fort at the end of the earth, guarding nothing, on a couple of useless rivers.
That triangle of land, sir, may be the most vital spot in this country.
Oh, my dear Colonel.
I visited John Fraser's forge there once.
And saw...
Coal and iron, that's what he saw.
Pittsburgh's like a hen sitting on more coal than she can hatch in a thousand years.
Cook the iron with that coal and what've you got? Steel.
Why, that town'll sprout into a city of maybe four or five thousand folks.
Don't laugh, gentlemen.
John's a good gunsmith and we may need more guns than words to build a future.
I've given my opinion.
If you ignore it, l'll wash my hands clean of the whole matter.
I hope they stay clean.
Captain Holden.
Mr. Garth knows the Indians.
He ought to.
He's married to Guyasuta's daughter and is a blood brother of the Senecas.
Watch your words, man.
Didn't you exchange blood with Guyasuta?
Yes.
That's why the Senecas trade with me rather than with Crawford or Croghan.
My trading posts would be the first to go up in the smoke of an Indian war.
Then why did you send hundreds of muskets from England?
Thousands of flints, tons of bar lead and powder to...
Captain Holden, what are you suggesting?
Captain Holden is somewhat bitter toward me because of a pretty bond slave aboard ship.
Seems he's lost his famous luck with the ladies.
You still haven't explained the shipments of arms, Mr. Garth.
Explain them?
I deny them.
Any other information you'd like?
Yes.
In case of an Indian war, which side would you be on?
I've killed men for less than that.
For much less.
Captain Holden, l suggest that you control yourself and leave Mr. Garth to control the Indians.
Control?
No one can control the Indians, once they've sent around the red belt of war.
But if you close the Ohio to settlement, the war belt will never be passed.
It has been passed.
What?
When?
MAN: That's hard to believe.
How do you know?
John Fraser took this off an Ottawa near Venango.
Crossed tomahawks.
The war belt.
A war belt!
That otter there is Pontiac's sign.
On its way to Guyasuta.
Mr. Garth's blood brother.
Colonel Bouquet, that belt makes it a matter for the army.
I have no army.
What? Why?
The Black Watch is just in from the Caribbean, fever among the men.
Do you expect miracles?
We cannot be ready for four months.
Four months?
There won't be a live settler west of the mountains.
Then pull your settlers back.
Or stop the war before it breaks.
How?
By sending peace belts to all the chiefs.
Peace belts?
Yes.
Why not, Sir William?
Calling a council.
It's worked before.
Pontiac'd make buzzard bait out of the man hat carried them.
No.
No, l believe the peace belts could get through if they were carried by an expert woodsman such as Captain Holden.
Holden?
It'd be murder, Chris.
Why?
He knows the Indians, he knows the trails, and he's a dead shot.
What do you say,
Captain Holden?
I'll take them, Sir William.
That was a brave thing you just said, Captain.
I'll provide the scouts,
Captain.
I guess l'll provide my own scouts, Mr. Garth.
Where'll you be?
Wolf Creek with Guyasuta and Pontiac.
BONE: Get back in the wagon.
How soon can you start?
Tonight, if John Fraser gets me buckskins and a rifle.
The peace belts will not be ready for three days.
How will you go?
By Nemacolin's Path.
I'll take charge of the pathfinding.
You're not going, John.
Now, Chris, there's no reason...
Your wife would skin me alive.
You're going to drive my gear to Pittsburgh.
Captain, your mission is confidential.
If you run into trouble, you cannot tell the military or we'll have this war on our hands before we can fight it.
Colonel Bouquet is right.
Action by the military is the one thing that would instantly unite all the tribes behind Pontiac.
You'll be playing a Ione hand, Chris.
You might have use for this compass.
It's not Boston Common you'll be crossing.
WASHINGTON:
Indeed, it's not.
Headstones are the only milestones on Nemacolin's Path.
I haven't seen a bird or a wild critter in an hour.
Me, neither.
It don't smell right.
Joe.
Clean through the heart.
He's dead.
I've got the belts.
Come on. Save your scalp.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Dan, grab that branch.
This dang tree needs pruning.
My powder horn.
My powder horn, he's seen it.
Well, that's one good Injun.
Ottawa.
What's Ottawas doing in Seneca country?
Ask Garth.
No time for souvenirs, come on.
I reckon we shook them off.
You can't ever shake off an Indian.
I left my wind about six miles back.
I ought to have my brain dusted.
With that skull ax?
A few days ago, this tomahawk was on a ship with Garth.
He didn't waste much time passing them around.
Garth knew these belts were going through and he knew we were carrying them.
That's why Joe Lavat's back there with an arrow through him.
You still delivering peace belts?
We've got another job to do first, Dan.
Killing Garth, l guess.
I guess.
That's my job, Dan.
We'll split up and if l don't get through to Pittsburgh, the job is yours.
Let's get going.
I'm traveling over
Chestnut Ridge.
I'll cross Turkey Foot to the Old Braddock Road.
Nothing ever travels that but ghosts.
Be sure you ain't one of them.
Thanks.
I'll meet you on Coal Hill above Fort Pitt before noon.
Before noon.
You want this compass?
No.
I'd get lost.
Well, so long, Captain.
So long, Fur-face.
Dan McCoy with a compass.
Hang onto your powder horn this time.
What're you drinking?
Rum.
So am I.
Hey.
Well, don't swallow the cup.
I won't.
Five fingers of rum to drink to the King's birthday.
Go on and be nice to them.
None of that that trade slop you feed the savages.
MAN: Hey, get that jug of rum over here.
Ale.
Hey, you're pretty.
Ain't been here long, have you?
You've been here too long.
What's your name, dearie?
Corn whiskey.
Come here, Corn Whiskey.
Oh, don't. No, please.
I ain't gonna hurt you.
I just want...
Better you spilled blood.
Scrub it up before Bone beats the daylights out of you.
Come on. Come on or Bone'll charge you for a bath.
Hey, what about my liquor?
MAN 1: Lap it up off the floor, Jim.
MAN 2: Jake, you owe me one for this.
JAKE: There's plenty more at the bar.
Why you no run away?
Run away, Hannah? Where?
Where he no find you.
Garth?
He come here tonight for you.
Spilling that grog will add a year onto your time.
But l didn't...
Get out there.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Here's your bottle.
Keep out of sight.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Them Indians won't trade for nothing but gunpowder.
Give it to them.
It's breaking the law.
Give it to them.
And so, gentlemen, you see a mink skin.
But observe.
The mink skin is no longer a mink skin.
It has become a silver button.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
(BONE SPEAKING
NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE)
What's the ruckus?
Well, this aborigine here claims there were five little minks.
See for yourself there are only four.
One, two, three, four.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Why, you worthless, lard-bellied, thieving...
Trying to start a massacre?
We've got enough trouble.
Some more just came in the door.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Keep scrubbing.
Get along.
Looking for somebody?
Garth trade here?
Some.
Where is he?
How do l know?
This Ottawa knows.
No, he just come in from up north.
Northeast, maybe from Chestnut Ridge.
What of it?
He's a friendly Indian.
He is? Then, why is he wearing a dead man's powder horn?
He ain't.
Powder horns are easy to get.
Not this one.
Get Mr. Bone a drink.
From over there.
This Indian killed Dan McCoy to get a leather pouch.
Where is it?
I don't know.
But if you came here looking for trouble, you've found it.
Keep both hands on that drink, Mr. Bone.
Where's the pouch?
Is this what you're looking for?
Shut your...
Bone.
Yes, that's it.
You've certainly come down in the world.
So has my opinion of you.
Is this Mr. Garth's hospitality?
You're not going anywhere.
Keep your hands flat on the bar.
I figured you'd do better with your freedom.
What freedom?
Freedom to be beaten with a whip, to serve and to scrub and milk, from sunup to midnight?
Then crawl into a cornhusk bed too tired to sleep or even cry?
Why don't you quit?
A slave can't quit.
Slave?
But l set you free.
You never set her free.
No. He bought me and tonight he's selling me to Garth.
Shut up, you.
Keep both hands on that drink, Mr. Bone.
Tonight, huh?
Get your things, Abby.
I haven't any things.
You have two feet, get up on them and bring the pouch.
I'll break your arms if...
No, you won't.
I bought her and if she's not free, she's mine.
Get behind me, Abby.
Now start for the door.
Art. Jake.
ART: Coming, boss.
JAKE: I'll get him.
I'll put a hole through the first thing in this room that moves.
Slave stealing means hanging.
You've got the right neck for it, Mr. Bone. Get your hand back on that drink.
Garth will be looking for you.
That's the idea.
That one was for Dan McCoy.
There's another one here for Joe Lavat if anybody wants it.
Get that rifle and get him at gunpoint.
We'll get him, boss.
Where to?
Fraser's forge, and don't pick my pocket on the way.
Hello, John.
Chris, what are you doing here?
You must have been traveling on a broomstick.
Sit down and let your breath catch up with you.
I thought you was on a job for Colonel Washington.
I am.
Well, what happened?
An Ottawa.
What's that?
A lady.
Thank you.
Did you bring her here to get shod?
Well, she cast a shoe.
John Fraser.
Yeah.
Where's that pressing iron you were heating for me?
Scalping's too good for you.
Standing there lollygagging with every Tom...
Land o'mighty, Chris!
Well, Half-Pint.
Let me look at you.
(EXCLAIMS) Pretty.
Oh, Chris.
Right in front of my own husband.
What'd you come here for?
King's birthday ball?
I didn't know he was having one, but l came to dance it with you.
You're the biggest liar ever crossed the Alleghenies, except my John.
Chris, you're making me dizzy.
Stop prancing and tell me the truth.
Well, l tell you l came to trap a skunk.
Appears to me you trapped a chipmunk.
I beg your pardon,
Mistress Abigail, l want you to meet the love of my life,
Mrs. John Fraser.
Your servant, ma'am.
Well, she's nice-mannered.
She's the wench from the tavern.
Garth'll nail your hide to the barn door for this.
He owns everything in that tavern. What'd you bring her here for?
To give her a bath.
Save us, what next?
What for you want to give her a bath?
Because she's dirty.
Look at her hair, look at her clothes, look at her...
Well, look at her.
She's stolen goods, Chris.
Ain't your place to wash other people's belongings.
Scrub her clean enough and even Garth won't know her.
You're just plumb crazy.
Where's that luggage of mine you brought from Peakestown?
She can't go to the ball looking like that.
The King's birthday ball? Me?
He is crazy.
I believe you're right.
You're gonna be scrubbed so clean that you're gonna look like new.
Not by you, l'm not.
Now your back.
Oh, stop wiggling, child.
I have soap in my mouth.
Well, keep it shut.
Skin's real pink when you get down to it.
More water.
This ought to fit.
She's about Diana's size.
I won't go to the ball.
You can't drag me around in your wife's old clothes.
Washing a slave girl ain't gonna stop no Injun bust-out.
Washing this one might.
Hey, what's this?
I don't know.
It's nothing for a bachelor.
Where's that water?
Bachelor? He's not a bachelor.
Oh, yes, he is, and he's gonna stay one.
You didn't get married?
No.
My uniform's in the other trunk.
Where is it, John?
In here.
He didn't get married.
Lucky escape for some woman. Stand up.
Chris, the whole frontier's just ready to bust wide open and here you are traipsing around with a little...
John, did you ever catch a bear with honey?
SERVANT:
Mr. And Mrs. George Carter.
I'll be right back, Carl.
All right, Sara.
Name, please.
Not me. Everybody knows me.
All right, sir.
Howdy, Carl.
I'm ready.
I'm hankering for a dance.
WOMAN: Oh, hello, Sally.
Having a good time?
Oh, Captain Ecuyer.
Every lady in Pittsburgh is simply perishing for a dance with you.
My dancing was ended by an old wound.
In the heart, Captain Ecuyer?
Unfortunately, a trifle lower.
I left my dancing days in
Switzerland. Captain Steele dances for me here.
I'll hold you to that, sir.
Look.
That's a vulgar noise,
Captain, but l agree with it.
Captain Christopher Holden,
Mistress Abigail Hale.
MAN: Abigail Hale?
Why are they staring so?
You look like Venus emerging from an emerald sea.
What a heavenly gown.
What an angel in it.
How would l look in a dress like that, Jim?
You'll never know, Ma.
How do you do?
I know you by reputation,
Captain Holden.
What brings you to Pittsburgh?
A lady from London, sir.
Mistress Abigail Hale,
Captain Ecuyer,
Commandant of Fort Pitt.
A charming breath of England to sweeten our wilderness.
My second in command,
Captain Steele.
Captain.
Your servant, ma'am.
I'm sure we've met before.
I think not, Captain, l've been very closely guarded.
We crossed the Atlantic on the same ship. She was allowed very little freedom.
You're still a riddle to me,
Miss Hale. Perhaps this dance will help solve it.
I'll solve this one,
Captain.
Outmaneuvered, Captain, huh?
John Fraser, l believe you're going to faint.
Get me to the punch bowl,
Mother.
Fine feathers certainly make a difference.
In this case, the bird improves the feathers.
You're quite a burst of plumage yourself,
Captain Holden.
You mean birds of a feather?
No, you think l'm a thief.
And you thought l was a liar.
I've seen that girl somewhere.
Must have been heaven.
GUARD 1: Post number two.
GUARD 2: Post number three.
GUARD 3: Post number four.
GUARD 4: Post number five.
All's well, isn't it?
Too quiet.
You seem to be watching for something.
Watchfulness isn't a bad thing, Abby, when you are at the edge of the end of the world.
Why? What's there?
Forests and savages.
The end of the present, the beginning of the future.
The beginning of the future,
Captain Holden?
Chris.
Why did you really come to Pittsburgh, Chris?
The moonlight is turning your dress into green fire.
It wasn't to set me free, as it?
And the stars are dancing in your eyes.
Did you come through
500 miles of wilderness to tell me the stars are dancing in my eyes?
Can you think of any better reason?
A woman only thinks what she wants to.
And you want to think l came to set you free?
Maybe no one has the right to own anyone else.
Men and women weren't made to be bought like yards of cloth.
At the tavern, you said you owned me.
I do.
But you want to be free, don't you?
I wonder...
Hey, you're ruining the ordnance.
I'm not sure l want to be free of you, Chris.
Why do you say that?
Because you've taken me out of a horrible nightmare.
Because you've given me kindness and happiness and understanding.
Abby, listen to me.
It wasn't kindness and understanding that made me bring you here.
No? Why did you bring me?
Because l know
Garth will follow.
Garth?
When he sees you here like this, he'll try to take you back, and then l can do what l came to
Pittsburgh to do.
Kill him? Is that it?
Yes, that's it.
And l'm the bait, staked out like a deer to draw a tiger.
That's true, isn't it?
Yes.
And you said the stars were in my eyes.
They were there.
Because l thought...
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Everything that you've done for me is because you wanted to challenge Garth.
You're not a man.
You're a walking loaded rifle with one bloodthirsty purpose, to kill Garth.
You haven't blood in your veins, you've gunpowder.
Abby, maybe you're right.
But this is more important than you or me, or both of us.
If Garth doesn't die within the next few hours, a lot of men and women on this frontier will.
You're either the world's greatest liar or the world's greatest fool.
You're probably both.
I'm going.
You'll stay and see it through.
Why should I?
Because l own you.
A few minutes ago you said nobody should be owned.
Do you ever mean anything you say, Captain Holden?
Here's your good-luck piece.
You'll need it when you meet Mr. Garth.
Miss Hale, l couldn't find you for our dance.
Yes, l know.
No, this one's mine, isn't it, Miss Hale?
No, l'm sorry.
Perhaps the next one,
Miss Hale.
Mistress Hale, you promised this dance to me.
What's happened to Chris?
Gentlemen, l'm not dancing.
Mrs. Fraser, may l have this dance?
I'd love to.
Love? With me?
Mistress Hale.
You promised.
There'll be no living with Baillie after this.
Yeah.
She's madder than a bucketful of hornets, Chris.
You needn't signal,
Mr. Fraser.
He'll know l'm here.
The bear has come for the honey.
He's come for your hide.
Then stand away from me,
Half-Pint.
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.
Mistress Hale, will you come forward?
They're going to crown you queen of the ball.
I think not.
May l have your arm, please?
Yes, Captain Ecuyer?
Is this the young lady,
Mr. Garth?
Yes, sir.
My runaway bond slave.
MAN: Bond slave?
I knew l'd seen her before.
WOMAN:
Mistress Hale from England.
Mistress Hale...
Quiet, quiet, please.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I'll take this girl.
Lieutenant, you may finish this dance with Miss Hale.
Well, sir, that's mighty good of you, but...
This girl is mine.
Captain Ecuyer, Mr. Garth has three indisputable talents.
He is a liar, a cheat and a coward.
Captain Holden.
Captain, l bought this girl, which makes him a liar, he stole her from me, which makes him a cheat, and he won't fight, which makes him a coward.
By your leave, sir.
Captain Steele, will you arrange the time and the place?
Who speaks for you, sir?
John Fraser, and the sooner the better.
The King's birthday ball is no place to arrange a duel.
Mr. Garth and l can step outside and settle this in a few minutes.
Sunup tomorrow.
The light will be better.
In the meantime, l'll take my property.
Not by law.
I am the law here.
The question of who owns this girl will be settled in my office.
Sergeant, music.
Yes, sir.
Ladles and gentlemen, continue dancing, please.
Captain Steele, bring
Miss Hale to my office.
Gentlemen.
WOMAN 1: Well, it might be, so come away.
WOMAN 2:
She scrubs the floors at Bone's tavern.
MAN 1: She can scrub the floor at my house any time she wants.
WOMAN 3: I wonder where she got that dress.
MAN 2: Stolen, l reckon.
Did you know this,
Jane Fraser?
Of course l did.
She's a mighty fine girl.
WOMAN 4: I still say that dress came from Paris.
Don't you go boiling over in there, now.
You ain't supposed to let on to the military why you're here.
Keep your scalp on, John.
Mine's on tighter than yours.
Captain Holden, you haven't one scrap of reason or evidence to support your claim to this girl.
The law requires a bill of sale.
I have it.
Norfolk notary.
Sold to Bone. Bone to me.
ECUYER:
These papers are in order.
You come brawling into Mr. Garth's tavern, killing Indians, stealing bond slaves and now you answer his rightful claim by hurling challenges like a bully in a schoolyard.
Captain Holden's been trying to pick a quarrel with me ever since we left England.
Why?
I ask permission not to answer that.
GARTH: He's a bad loser, that's all.
His vanity was hurt over this girl and he's followed me here to repair it with a bullet.
Is that true?
Did you come here because of this girl?
Yes, sir.
This woman is yours,
Mr. Garth.
You can take her.
Do you realize what you have done to this woman?
Mr. Garth has the legal right to give her the whipping post, the pillory, or the branding iron if he chooses to use it.
Mr. Garth won't live to use It.
Good evening, Captain Ecuyer.
Come, Abby.
You'd better take her out this way.
Captain Holden, you are under my orders.
If you harm... l'll send the dress back to you, Captain Holden.
I'm going after that girl.
No, you are not.
If you try, you'll spend the next five years in the fort's dungeon.
And don't look as though you'd like to cut my heart out.
It's against regulations.
Shall we join the ladies?
Bone leave for Venango?
Yes, two hours ago.
You know what to do.
Abby. You. Get out.
A little sherry, perhaps.
No.
I once penned an ode to the wines of Spain.
"Italian wines are rich..."
Abby. Wait.
"The wines of France are light as air but the wines of Spain..."
Are you going?
"The wines of Spain..."
Why did you go with Holden?
To be free.
He can't set you free.
He may, when he meets you at sunup tomorrow.
Tomorrow never comes.
Aren't you going to fight him?
I don't have to fight for you.
You're mine, just as my horse or my dogs or my boots are mine.
I'll serve my time, 14 years, l'll work faithfully...
Faithfully?
Running away with Holden?
I'm not going to punish you.
But you'll never forget again who you belong to.
Drums of war sound.
All fort die by white flag that is red.
Why do the Indians come to you?
Guyasuta wait for Garth.
You're with them.
Bring the girl.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Take your hands off me.
Stop it. Hannah, please make them stop.
Make them let me go.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN

Jeremy.
Jeremy.
You savages.
And you fighting a duel in the morning.
Why, this might be your last dance.
Excuse me, ma'am, l'll go and make my will.
Sorry, sir, you're not to pass.
Captain Ecuyer.
Where's the Captain?
What's happened?
Don't let those people in here. This is the King's birthday ball.
I'm sorry, sir, this woman's in distress...
Save your children.
Go. Go get your children.
That's Joe Pruitt's missus from Clapham's.
Clapham's?
That's more than 20 miles.
WOMAN 1: Poor soul.
WOMAN 2: Let me help.
Stand back. Give her room.
Clapham's ain't no more.
They're all dead.
What happened?
Injuns, they killed my Joe.
No.
That child is badly hurt.
Get Dr. Boyd.
Yes, sir.
Some brandy for this woman.
Yes, sir.
They crept up in the night.
How many?
More than 100 of them.
They massacred Colonel Clapham and all his womenfolk and Jim Mealy and the Garvice boys.
The murdering devils. Holden.
WOMAN: My babies.
I've got to get my babies.
Tom, come on.
My kids. I left them with a Seneca squaw.
Well, l was just visiting here.
May be a long visit.
Attention, everyone.
You will bring your families into the fort, your livestock and foodstuffs.
Major Trent, as the settlers come in, form them into militia companies.
Yes, sir.
Captain Steele, put the entire garrison under arms at their posts of alarm.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Hutchins.
Yes, sir.
Run up the signal torch on the gate staff.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Baillie.
Yes, sir.
One squad to stand by the drawbridge.
It remains down till all the settlers are in.
Yes, sir.
Sir, order to load the powder magazine.
Captain Holden.
Yes, sir.
Since you are anxious to leave, take 20 men and level the town.
Dismantle what you can and burn the rest.
Yes, sir.
And leave nothing standing to give cover to the savages.
Take Fraser.
Yes, sir.
Captain Holden.
Be sure you come back.
Yes, sir.
You can't burn my place,
Holden. It took me two years to build that store.
It'll take you all eternity to grow a new scalp.
Where to first, Chris?
Bone's tavern.
Watch your torches.
Move that log out of the way!
Search this place, men.
OFFICER: Stroud, stand watch by the door.
Go to Black Watch's until ordered.
Abby. Abby.
Search back there.
Keep you eyes peeled, now.
Abby.
Everywhere.
Sergeant, pile up everything in this room that will burn.
Yes, sir.
Not in the middle, against the counter...
Captain Holden.
Captain Holden.
JEREMY: Captain Holden.
Hey, Chris, come here.
Yes, sir.
Bring those chairs over here and throw them on.
Yes, sir.
Throw those bundles over.
Where's Abby?
They've taken her,
Hannah and the Indians, to Guyasuta's camp.
MAN: Hurry up, before those redsticks get here.
Guyasuta?
Yes.
Get me some dried meat and a powder horn.
Lend me your rifle and powder horn, John.
Chris, you can't go after her.
You wouldn't stand a chance.
You've seen what they do to white women.
Where are your bullets?
Ecuyer ordered you to burn this town.
They'll burn her.
And you spitted right alongside her.
Chris, you're the goldarndest, contrariest fool l ever did see. I'm going with you.
You're staying here and carrying out
Ecuyer's orders.
Here you are, Captain.
The dried meat and powder horn.
What am l going to tell
Ecuyer about you?
You tell him l'll report to him in heaven, if we both get there.
Good luck, sir.
MAN: All clear upstairs.
All right, put the torch to it.
Let her go.
Let it all come down.
Fire in the stable.
Yes, sir.
Throw a torch under the stairwell.
Here, strike the Ottawas under Pontiac.
Fort Detroit.
Here, the Mingos of Chief Skarat.
Fort Niagara.
Here, the Wyandots of Chief Takee.
Fort Sandusky.
Here, the Senecas under you, Genowah.
Fort Venango.
And here you, Guyasuta, with Delawares, Shawnees and Senecas.
Fort Pitt.
Ecuyer is a shrewd, strong warrior.
Sioto has made medicine.
Fort Pitt will die.
All these forts must die.
By white flag that is red.

Protect her.
What are they going to do?
Before white one come,
Garth see only this one.
I've tried to tell you that he...
This one love Garth, very big love.
He doesn't mean anything to me.
He mean much to me.
Soon white one, no more.
This one go with husband.
Hannah.
I've heard what they do to white women.
I'm not very brave.

Maybe l've come to the wrong village.
I was looking for great warriors, the Seneca.
Chris, you can't save me.
We are Seneca.
These?
These are not the Senecas l know. I was there when they stopped Braddock.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
These...
These are just squaws painted like men, only fit to torture women.
Chris, they'll kill you.
Keep your tongue between your teeth.
Who calls himself Chief among these woman fighters?
I am Guyasuta.
You think we are women?
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
I am unarmed.
You forget your own laws.
Tell these squaws l come in peace.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
You come in peace, go in peace.
That's better.
Untie her.
Why you come?
I bring belts of peace from Sir William.
Red belt of war has passed.
White man's forts will burn. All die.
White woman burn.
Some may die, but more will come, always more.
White man's medicine is strong, nothing can stop them.
Sioto medicine stop them.
Can Sioto match his medicine against mine?
Sioto can make rains come, winds blow.
Sioto can speak to the dead.
With my medicine l can take this woman, even this worthless squaw and vanish as l came, and Sioto and all your braves can never find us.
You speak big words.
Stand back.
This magic is strong.
It obeys only me.
Watch this little arrow.
It is magic.
Little arrow point to that tree and nowhere else.
Now, you feathered vulture, you make it point somewhere else.
Here, take it.
If it obeys you, the girl dies and l die with her.
But if it does not obey Sioto, l will take the girl and you cannot follow until the arrow turns.
Is it a bargain?
It is bargain.
Make arrow point.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Looks like the little arrow only hears the white man's tongue.
Point at fire.
Little arrow, do not listen to Sioto's medicine.
Point at fire.
Looks like you're not doing so well.
Oh, Chris.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Sioto say not magic.
Arrow point all time at tree.
It points where l tell it to.
It will point at you.
Chris, you can't.
You know it won't.
Squaw talk.
Arm yourself, Guyasuta.
This is the medicine of death.
Give him a knife, the tomahawk.
Not this one, one of the new steel ones of Garth's, a gun.
Now, little arrow, point to the chief of the Seneca.
Take it.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Tell Sioto to make it turn from you if he can.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Turn, arrow.
Point at white man.
The little arrow points only at you, Guyasuta.
Release the squaw.
Take her. Take her.
Guyasuta is once again a great chief.
No. No. Help.
Let her go. Let go.
Get out of here. Go on, go on.
Get away. Get away.
Get away. Go on. Get away.
Get out of here.
Don't fall. Keep your nerve.
I haven't much left.
Don't let them know it, we're not out of here yet.
Guyasuta, if your men follow before that arrow moves it will go right through your heart.
Keep going. Keep going.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Now get.
It's dawn. They'll be hunting us by daylight.
What can we do?
Die more comfortably.
Follow me.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Push those two adrift and get in the other one.
Where to?
Kingdom come.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
(ORDERING IN NATIVE
AMERICAN LANGUAGE)
Look, Chris, they're coming.
Save your breath for paddling.
We're gaining.
Current's faster.
There are rapids ahead.
There's worse behind.
Hand me your paddle and move back here.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
(ORDERING IN NATIVE
AMERICAN LANGUAGE)
(YELLING IN NATIVE
AMERICAN LANGUAGE)
Chris, the waterfall.
Untie my sash.
Put the sash around my neck and tie it under your arms.
We're going over.
Hang onto me and pray.
Hold tight. Here we go.
Oh, Chris.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Wolves.
There, my little nimrod, is your wolf.
Well, he had wolves for ancestors.
Hello, boy.
Hello, boy, hello, boy.
You all alone?
Where's your family?
They had to get out in a hurry. Look here.
"Injuns Riz.
Me and missus gone to Venango.
"You better get there too if you can read this.
Ben Salter."
We'd better get inside for the night.
What is it?
Clothes.
I wonder if Mrs. Salter would mind.
Well, l'm borrowing
Mr. Salter's shirt whether he minds or not.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Food. Beans.
Just like coming home.
Chris?
Yes.
What happened to the little dog?
Out chasing varmints, l guess.
We'll take him along with us to Ben Salter and his wife at Venango.
I wonder why they didn't take him.
"Benjamin Salter, his Bible."
I was thinking the Salters must have been very happy here.
Why?
It feels like it, doesn't it?
I guess so.
Back in London, l used to want to be a grand lady with carriages and mansions.
Maybe you will someday.
No.
Now l just want what the Salters have. This.
Was she very pretty?
Hmm?
Who?
The girl you bought the green dress for.
Oh, Diana.
I guess so.
Why didn't you marry her?
She liked someone else better.
Better than you?
She must have been crazy.
Good night, Chris.
Good night, Abby.
Hey, aren't you a little bit old to be playing with dolls, young fellow?
Hey, what's the matter?
What's troubling you, huh?
What do you got?
What do you got out there, a bear?
Well, all right, let's go get him.
Come on.
Say, you're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this morning.
Hey, what's the matter?
What...
Chris? Chris?
Go back in the house, Abby.
Why? What are you doing?
Digging.
Look, good fit. Nice color.
What's this?
A doll.
The Salters won't be coming back, Abby.
They never left.
What do you mean?
Why is the dog...
Don't look.
No one has a chance in this wilderness.
Nobody can fight it.
It'll always be wilderness.
The savages will burn and torture and kill until they get it back.
Abby, get a couple of those sticks and tie them together for a cross.
People like the Salters can never be stopped, Abby.
The Indians can kill them and run them off, but more will keep coming.
The Salters are the New World, unconquered.
Unconquerable because they're strong and free, because they have faith in themselves, and in God.
Here, tie it together with this.
Chris. I need shoeing again.
Venango is just around the bend.
It is? Let's look.
Let's patch the moccasin first.
You mean Venango's goodbye.
Maybe.
You know, they can make a lot of trouble for runaway slaves.
Maybe we'd better call you Mrs. Holden.
Mrs. Holden?
Just for Venango, of course.
Of course. Just for Venango.
But then you may get to like the sound of it.
Might even want it for keeps.
Here.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Yes.
Try it on.
Because you're sorry for me.
I'm only sorry that it took to long to find you.
Hey, what are you crying about?
It's just that l'm so full of happiness it's...
It's overflowing.
What is it?
What are you looking at?
Vultures.
They had surrendered.
It's horrible.
What's that?
Pop, you're alive.
No, l ain't.
For three days, l been a-dying here, and you don't come along until l'm dead.
You've got lots of life, Pop.
Abby, get that canteen of water.
Don't get me no water.
I ain't that dead.
Prop me up.
I'm busted clean through.
How'd the Indians get in?
They walked in.
Chief Genowah, that mangy polecat.
Three times he comes to the fort with his white flag and his promises.
"Surrender," says he,
"and you'll all go free."
When the grub run out, everybody started yelping to run up the white flag.
I warned them, but nobody'd listen.
So they run up that danged white rag.
And all the folks went out, and them redsticks come a-hooting and a-shooting and massacred every last one of them under that white flag.
For three days, l've been trying not to die till some dang fool like you comes along, to warn Fort Pitt.
Fort Pitt.
You got long legs, get them a-going.
You can get down the river at night in a canoe.
Chris?
We're going east.
No, we're not.
That was just a dream we dreamed together for a little while.
We're going east.
There are 600 lives at Fort Pitt.
And Garth is one of them.
You're his, Abby.
If we go back, you go back to him.
We have no choice.
Of course, you ain't.
Get back to Fort Pitt.
Show them this flag.
Tell them what the redsticks is up to.
"Go free," they says.
"Take your people and your cattle.
"All we want is our hunting ground."
That's what he says,
"Take your people and your cattle.
"All we want is our hunting..."
"Go free.
"Take your people and your cattle.
"All we want is our hunting ground."
It's signed with Guyasuta's totem.
We're in a bad way, sir.
We've had no word yet from Colonel Bouquet's relief column.
Are you suggesting we surrender?
Put your weight on that.
I don't think much of our chances.
Then stop thinking.
Heat an iron, Dr. Boyd.
This arrow may have been poisoned.
Tell Guyasuta this is our home and we will defend this ground till the last warrior lies under it.
I'll send my wife with your message,
Captain Ecuyer, but after two months of siege, you've only a few days' provisions.
I just told you...
Get out, get out, both of you.
You'll kill this man.
Captain Steele, you are in command.
Yes, sir.
What's going on here? At ease.
What are you doing with that rope?
We're raising a ghost.
I hope it's a scout from Bouquet.
Oh, Chris, where in blazes did you come from?
I'm sure glad to see you breathing.
Go down and give Abby a boost.
Sure.
We didn't expect you'd come this way again,
Captain Holden.
I have a report for Captain Ecuyer, sir.
Captain Ecuyer is wounded.
I am in command.
There's been treachery at Fort Venango, sir.
Treachery?
That's a strange word from you.
You were under orders to burn the town of Pittsburgh and report back to Captain Ecuyer, were you not?
Yes, sir.
John, let her stand on your shoulders.
You're under arrest for desertion in the face of the enemy.
But, sir...
Mr. Hutchins, disarm him.
That elusive little bond slave will be held as a material witness until the court martial.
I don't believe this cock-and-bull story that Venango surrendered.
Bone here got through.
He says the fort still stands.
Captain Holden is obviously trying to protect himself and this girl.
The Mohawk Trail to Albany and Boston is what they were headed for, and the Indians drove them back.
That's probably Indian blood on this flag.
No, gentlemen, you need more proof than the word of a deserter.
We came back to save your fool necks.
Because there's a Judas here who won't stop until this flag flies over this fort and you're all dead beneath it.
Captain Holden is out of order.
Attacking Mr. Garth will not alter the record.
Return to your seat.
Proceed.
Was the accused headed for he Mohawk Trail and Boston?
What difference does it make?
You're all going to pay a terrible price for not believing us.
Confine yourself to the question.
Was he trying to escape with you to Boston?
I won't answer that.
You must answer.
She needn't.
We were heading for the Mohawk Trail to Albany and Boston.
I submit to the court the prisoner has admitted desertion.
Upon consideration of the matter before it, this court finds the accused guilty of desertion in the face of the enemy.
In accordance with the articles of war, prisoner will be stripped of his military rank and held in confinement until the firing party will execute the sentence of death.
Remove the prisoner.
The runaway bond slave will be returned to her lawful master, Mr. Garth.
Go back to the women's quarters.
You bring white one.
You tried to burn her at the stake.
Your tongue is forked.
I'm through with you.
The firelight's very becoming to that red hair, Abby.
I really should thank Holden for saving you for me, if the firing squad gives me time.
No.
For me, or for you?
For me.
I don't want you to die.
I want you to live.
You can't force me to live any more than you can force me to love.
You belong to me.
You don't want me as a slave.
No, l want you to come to me of your own free will.
I'll come to you of my own free will.
Abby.
Nothing for nothing's given here.
What do you want?
A word from you can open doors.
Sentries can be missing, a guard looking the other way.
You want Chris Holden's life.
Let him go tonight.
Give him his chance to live, and l'll be here.
That stubborn fool would rather die in the morning than leave without you.
He'll go.
It'll be just you and me, alone?
I promise.
(WHISPERS) Chris. Chris.
Abby. How did you... l've been saying goodbye to you over and over again for hours.
Seeing you doesn't make it any easier.
Here.
How did you...
You can get away through the sally port tunnel.
Did someone push the sentry in the river?
Time's running out.
Where's the guard?
You still have friends.
No, this way.
Isn't that door locked?
It will open.
John Fraser?
Find the relief column.
Tell Colonel Bouquet how desperate things are here.
No sentry at the sally port either.
Fraser must have bribed the whole garrison, or did he?
Don't question me, Chris, just go.
Are you going with me?
I'm staying here.
Fraser didn't open these doors, Abby.
Get the relief here, Chris.
Don't let Fort Pitt become another Venango.
You opened them.
You and l died together back there at Venango.
There'll be a mug of rum for every hole in his carcass.
You'll need a keg, Mr. Garth.
These men are possum hunters.
Watch the moat by the sally port tunnel there.
Something moving.
I'll send your keg of rum to the barracks.
Abby?
This one, wife.
You'll go back to your father.
The one you tried to kill will be my wife.
White one love Holden man.
Holden is dead.
Not dead.
He was shot crossing the moat.
No.
This one.
Hannah.
Holden man bring white chief, many, many soldier.
Little fool, why did you do it?
This one wife.
MAN 1: Fire attack on the...
MAN 2: Bucket brigade!
Bucket brigade!
MAN 3: How many men?
MAN 4: Get that roof wet!
Come on. Come on.
Start some this way.
The south barrack's on fire.
Steady there, steady.
WOMAN: Gotta keep moving.
You gotta keep these buckets moving.
Get down.
Here you are.
Hold on to it.
Water wouldn't do you no harm.
Get this fire out.
Hey, Ma, look.
Injuns coming up on that ledge.
You get in the house.
Oh, Ma.
Run along when you're told.
Kill him, Jeremy. Kill him.
Load with chain shot.
Here.
Throw a bunch at them.
Throw it, Jeremy. Throw it!
They can't wait,
Colonel Bouquet.
Fort Pitt can't last three days.
I won't leave my wounded here, and l can't advance a yard till the artillery comes up.
But you can't throw away the 600 lives in Fort Pitt.
Chris.
Captain, l have lost a quarter of my men here at Bushy Run.
Do the Indians know that, sir?
I pray they don't.
If we can make them think...
Think what, Chris?
Send this dispatch back to Legonnier.
Yes, sir.
Colonel, can you give me 100 men?
A hundred?
I can spare 20.
Those men out there.
What?
Give me those men, Colonel, and some wagons.
Are you mad, Chris?
Those men are dead.
And your drums and pipers, and 10 of your Black Watch.
It can't be done, but go ahead and try it.
Whatever is left of us won't be far behind you.
You are hungry.
Steady.
No powder for gun.
Put white flag on pole.
Take your people, go back safe over mountain.
Guyasuta, you can save your breath to run from
Colonel Bouquet's soldiers.
MAN 1: Ain't that an army musket?
MAN 2: Yeah, a Brown Bess.
MAN 3: Ain't one of ours.
The 42nd.
The Kilties.
It's their flag, the Black Watch.
Where'd they get it?
It's the 42nd for sure.
Do you suppose they...
Quiet.
'Tis a Highland bonnet all right.
Where do you suppose they got it?
From the Highlanders.
No mistaking that coat.
I tell you it's a trick.
Bouquet soldier dead.
Chris.
Don't believe the lying varmints.
I come no more.
White flag not on pole when time stick burn there, all die.
Mama.
Hush, dear.
We'll hold our fire exactly six minutes.
That means attack.
Post what additional men you have on the higher bastion.
This birch bark will burn fast.
MAN: Detail dismissed.
Captain Ecuyer should make this decision.
He's a sick man.
You'd better decide for yourself or they'll decide for you.
Where's the relief they promised us?
I say surrender and hoist this flag.
You're yellow, Bone.
We gotta keep on fighting, and anybody that don't think so, pick up that rag.
Why, you.
Mr. Fraser, give me that flag.
Captain Steele.
Hey.
Don't let them hoist this flag.
Hear them war drums?
They'll stop in a minute, then hang onto your hair.
And hang on tight.
Over there,
Grant and his Highlanders were massacred and scalped.
And over there,
Braddock's whole command was massacred.
MAN: But we're stronger.
Now Bouquet is wiped out at Bushy Run.
Will you make
Fort Pitt the next?
MAN: He's right.
The Indians know and all these people know, that your last chance died with the massacred relief column.
MAN: We can't fight with sticks.
What do you say,
Captain Steele?
I ain't aiming to surrender.
We got no chance.
WOMAN: There's the kids to think of.
My wife and me aim to fight it out.
With what, broom sticks?
Quiet. Quiet.
As a soldier, l'd fight.
But as a man responsible for the lives of these women and children, l feel compelled to accept the enemy's terms.
Captain, no. Don't raise it.
I saw the white flag at Venango stained with the blood of people like these who believed the Indians.
I'll vouch for the Indians.
I saw it, Captain.
Raise this flag at the gate staff.
There's plenty of us who'd rather fight, sir.
And l'm one of them.
Proceed, Mr. Hutchins.
MAN: Oh, we'll regret this.
Clark, we'll inform
Captain Ecuyer in his sick room.
Yes, sir.
Give up now, what chance have we got?
We give up, all them massacred folks died for nothing.
If my Joe was alive, he'd say,
"Keep fighting."
You hoist that flag and l'll shoot it down.
With what? An empty rifle?
Get it up, sonny, before we lose our scalps.
I'll have no truck with surrendering.
You ain't got three kids,
Jane Fraser. Get it up.
Garth vouches for the Indians.
Your last chance.
The time's up.
Do you hear?
The drums have stopped.
MAN: That's the signal.
WOMAN:
Get that flag up, quick.
Wait, young man.
Hold that flag.
It may be the wind.
It may be my wishing, but it sounds like the pipes of heaven itself.
I don't hear nothing.
Get it up.
Get it up or we'll all be hearing the pipes of heaven.
No, listen, you big ox.
JEREMY: Listen.
It is. It is.
Chris got through.
There they are.
I can see them.
How many do you see?
It's them.
It's the pipes of the 42nd.
That's Bouquet's column.
Bouquet.
MAN: Tear up that white flag.
GIRL: How many be there, Pa?
I don't know.
Ain't had time to count them yet.
That's the first time l've enjoyed the sound of a bagpipe.
I want to see them.
Come on, take him.
Try not to look as scared as l feel.
They cannot see the hair standing up beneath me bonnet.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Chris. They're running.
They're running.
Run, you varmints, run.
So Bouquet was wiped out, was he?
Look at them Indians run.
Get to the stable and saddle up three horses.
Three?
I'm taking Abby.
And stock up three saddlebags. Move.
See them, Mr. Garth, ain't it grand?
If l had me a wife, l'd raise hallelujah.
I'll marry you.
Something's wrong with that column.
Looks awfully good to me, sir.
We'll head south into Cherokee country and build back from there.
We can go down the Mon side and hug the bank.
MAN: Hurry up with that bridge, soldier.
WOMAN: Glory be, you're a grand sight.
Chris. Chris, the stables.
Get to the stables.
MAN: Look at them.
Why are they so still,
Jeremy?
The gentlemen are dead.
We'll mount in here.
Hey.
They've stopped yelling.
Give her a hand up.
Chris.
Get over there, Bone.
That's far enough.
Stand clear, Abby.
She's coming with me.
Where you're going, you're going alone.
Let him have it, Bone.
HOLDEN: Bone won't shoot me.
BONE: I won't, huh?
No.
Abby, stand over there.
Because l'm the only one between you and the hangman's rope for double-selling a slave.
Fergus out there doesn't know you acted for Garth.
I do.
But you won't be talking.
Bone, turn your back and get your hands up on that ladder.
All right, Holden.
I'm not fool enough to try to beat you on the draw.
You win.
You can take my gun.
I know you wouldn't shoot a man in the back.
ABBY: Look out, Chris.
You are a better man than you are a soldier,
Holden.
You have earned a firing squad for deserting this fort.
And our gratitude for helping save it.
When Colonel Bouquet arrives, the frontier can start moving west again.
Move with it.
Captain Ecuyer.
What?
Would you... Could you...
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Who stands for you?
Here, put it on.
Hold hands.
I pronounce you man and wife until you find a minister.
Marriage frees you from slavery, Mrs. Holden.
It won't do the same for you, sir.
You're sweet.
East or west, Abby?
Make it west.
And don't get caught by the Indians again.
Yes, sir.
Or anybody else. Stay free.
Yes, sir.
And close that door.

{11084}{11170}For the benefit of newcomers,|you're here because you volunteered.
{11174}{11274}You're well-trained, highly selected men,|and we're glad to have you aboard.
{11278}{11338}You may be infants in|the submarine service...
{11342}{11417}...but you'll be veterans|by the time we make port again.
{11421}{11465}We've had pretty fair luck so far.
{11469}{11540}Let's hope we really smear them|this time.
{11556}{11622}- Dismiss the crew.|- Aye, aye, sir.
{11628}{11667}Leave your quarters.
{11792}{11910}Shore connection is clear. Topside|secured, all except mooring lines.
{11924}{11970}Okay, chief.
{11988}{12065}All tested out. Ship ready|for getting under way, sir.
{12069}{12129}Number one and two|main engines on propulsion.
{12133}{12194}Okay, let's go.
{12198}{12242}Single up!
{12308}{12356}Answer bells.
{12360}{12408}Take in one!
{12426}{12483}Pull five! Port, back one-third.
{12560}{12616}Port, stop.
{12620}{12679}Take in five!
{12710}{12767}All ahead one-third.
{13264}{13372}- Hatch secured.|- Report, forward room rigged for diving.
{13409}{13477}What do you think you are?|The pipes of Pan?
{13481}{13532}This, Dakota, is a genuine Nazi flute.
{13536}{13608}- I paid an Atlantic sailor 5 bucks for it.|- Nazi flute?
{13612}{13666}You can get them in Frisco for four bits.
{13675}{13740}- You know of Tarpon Springs, Florida?|- Sure.
{13744}{13776}- You do?|- Yeah.
{13780}{13856}The best fishermen in the world|are the Greeks, my people.
{13860}{13892}You're Greek?
{13896}{13941}- Greek-American.|- What's your name?
{13945}{14027}Leos Deopoulis Gurfelis Junior.|That "junior" is pure American.
{14031}{14127}But seeing you're off a destroyer|we'll settle for "Tin Can." Okay?
{14131}{14225}Okay, just so long as nobody|around here calls me "Hey, Greek."
{14229}{14283}- I'm sensitive.|- Oh, Mike.
{14307}{14355}Surprise.
{14411}{14453}Here's that 5-spot I borrowed.
{14457}{14563}- Fine time to pay me back.|- But I did pay you.
{14584}{14685}There goes one of the nicest guys|that ever borrowed 5 bucks from me.
{14700}{14760}Why doesn't the captain|wear his decorations?
{14764}{14840}- Doesn't need to.|- We heard a lot about him at sub school.
{14844}{14896}You can believe anything that was good.
{14900}{15002}Those torpedoes cost 12,000 bucks|apiece. Our skipper doesn't waste them.
{15006}{15096}He's got more plain intestinal fortitude|than any guy I ever met.
{15100}{15160}I'd follow him right into|the mikado's bathtub.
{15164}{15206}Do you think we'll see action?
{15210}{15268}Good. That's why I got off|that four-stacker.
{15272}{15341}Up and down, nothing but escorting.|Made me sick.
{15345}{15409}- Sitting on a beehive?|- I know. He wants a medal.
{15413}{15476}Who cares about medals?|I got a better reason.
{15480}{15540}Pipe down. Look.
{15544}{15670}In all my 12 years in the Navy,|I never seen a doll on a submarine.
{15722}{15796}I won her, Mike. Cute, huh?
{15814}{15874}- She gonna bunk with you?|- Yep.
{15878}{15934}She's a liberty gimmick.|Makes gals jealous.
{15938}{15975}- Jealous of that doll?|- Sure.
{15979}{16037}I take her into a joint, sit her on a table.
{16041}{16103}Then we have a long talk.|It never fails.
{16107}{16176}Dame comes up and says,|"That's the best you can do?"
{16180}{16227}I says, "That's up to you, honey."
{16250}{16300}What happens then?
{16304}{16365}- How old are you, Tommy?|- Nineteen.
{16369}{16419}Come back next year.
{16444}{16522}Say, that's a cute military objective|you got there.
{16535}{16632}- That's my sister.|- Oh, intelligent too.
{16642}{16756}Well, if you boys don't mind, Nita and I,|we want to be alone, don't we?
{16760}{16872}See? It's cute. I told you.|You know, it works all the time.
{17125}{17198}Passed the submarine net, captain.
{17242}{17346}Well, Andy, it'll be a long time|between beers.
{17950}{18012}Merry Christmas, Mike.
{18114}{18179}Merry Christmas, Tommy.
{18288}{18362}This is the first Christmas|I ever spent underwater.
{18366}{18450}You should have been aboard with us|Christmas Day 1941.
{18454}{18516}The Japs sure gave us|a Christmas present.
{18520}{18609}Blasted the living daylights out of us|off Lingayen Gulf.
{18613}{18696}Between depth charges,|we ate Christmas dinner in the dark...
{18700}{18785}...200 feet down.|Ice water and sandwiches.
{18789}{18944}Well-sprinkled with rust and chips of|paint that kept flying off the bulkheads.
{18948}{19101}- Bet you said your prayers.|- I sure did. Some extra Hail Marys too.
{19105}{19184}- You think prayers do any good, Mike?|- Sure, they do.
{19188}{19259}Some guys say, "Go ahead, prove to me|there's a God."
{19263}{19381}I don't argue. I just know,|like I know there's salt in the sea.
{19385}{19432}That's the way it is with me too.
{19436}{19551}Look, Mike, if we get depth-charged,|and I show any signs of being yellow...
{19555}{19614}...you sock me.|- Right on the button.
{19618}{19707}- That's a promise?|- It's a promise.
{19711}{19776}If I were in Connecticut now...
{19780}{19868}...Mother and Dad would come in|to wake me singing Christmas carols.
{19872}{19943}It's sort of a custom they started|when I was a kid.
{20110}{20182}Pretty, ain't it?|Those guys practice all year for this.
{20186}{20245}- Merry Christmas.|- Merry Christmas, you guys!
{20249}{20299}- Merry Christmas, Tin Can!|- Happy Noel.
{20303}{20339}Same to you and many more.
{20556}{20604}Merry Christmas, skipper.
{20612}{20663}Merry Christmas, fellas.
{20667}{20714}Merry Christmas, skipper.
{21536}{21596}And a very merry Christmas|to you gents.
{21600}{21669}We'll have to top the diesels.
{22544}{22614}Hey, get a load of him, will you?
{22712}{22754}Presents.
{22841}{22911}"For Pills, the pharmacist's mate,|a mournful knell.
{22915}{23002}He dropped his vitamins|down the periscope well."
{23009}{23052}So, what do you got?
{23080}{23137}"The new kid forward|is wiser but sadder.
{23141}{23220}Since he stepped on the skipper|coming down the ladder!"
{23224}{23280}I apologized.
{23300}{23355}"On Wolf's grave, a wreath is laid.
{23359}{23455}Since he tangled his line|with that chambermaid."
{23459}{23495}- Come on, open it.|- Open it!
{23737}{23788}You should have had it filled.
{23816}{23872}"All hands get ready|to upchuck this dinner.
{23876}{23960}With Cookie in the galley,|we're going to get thinner."
{24020}{24056}Fine, listen.
{24060}{24160}If that ain't a new high|for gratitude.
{24164}{24243}Who practically mothers|all the guys on this ship?
{24247}{24284}I do.
{24288}{24370}Who bends over a hot stove|all day long for you guys?
{24374}{24406}I do.
{24416}{24492}Who's going to get all the glory|when you sink a Jap ship?
{24496}{24539}You! That's who.
{24543}{24609}Who's gonna get the medals|from this war? You guys!
{24613}{24748}And what am I going to get? Nothing but|varicose veins and dishwater hands!
{24755}{24804}Open it! Open it!
{24822}{24871}What have you got? Open it.
{25245}{25293}Gee, guys.
{25309}{25378}You shouldn't have done it.
{25450}{25504}Lookouts to the bridge.
{25508}{25544}Keep your eyes peeled, kid.
{25548}{25619}All submarines look alike.|We're nobody's friend.
{25623}{25720}Even our ships will shoot first|and ask questions afterward.
{25744}{25800}He listens to you like you were|a tin god.
{26107}{26224}- Look pretty snappy today, captain.|- You know, Christmas.
{26410}{26489}- Coffee, sir.|- Thank you.
{26519}{26598}- All clear starboard.|- All clear port.
{26618}{26676}You fellas know me.|I'm no highbrow.
{26680}{26752}When I come home, if there's|any grand opera playing...
{26756}{26845}...the whole Connors family goes|down there twice a week.
{26849}{26932}Don't ask me why, but to me, it's like|going down in a sub.
{26936}{27012}You shove off,|go deep under the sea.
{27016}{27048}When you come back up...
{27052}{27129}...you got something inside|that's never been there before.
{27133}{27181}Irish and Greeks, born philosophers.
{27186}{27219}I got a philosophy too.
{27223}{27305}Every day a box of Cracker Jacks|with a prize in every package.
{27309}{27380}I feel sorry for you.|You don't know what family means.
{27384}{27464}Family means a house has a mortgage,|the kids have measles...
{27468}{27568}...and the old man pays for the insurance|when he's dead. No, not for Wolfie.
{27572}{27640}The only babies I want|are those born 21 years ago.
{27644}{27732}Captain has given permission to pick up|the San Francisco newscast.
{27743}{27824}This broadcast comes to you|from the Friendly Credit Company.
{27828}{27956}The Friendly Credit Company trusts you.|Any amount from $ 25 to $ 1000.
{27963}{28058}And so Christmas Day|is bright on all fronts.
{28062}{28148}San Francisco police are continuing|the manhunt for a sailor...
{28152}{28199}... wanted on several counts.
{28205}{28277}The woman making the complaints|insists on prosecution.
{28281}{28384}The sailor was last seen boarding a|United States submarine at Mare Island.
{28388}{28496}The sailor is known to the girls|only as "Wolf."
{28513}{28589}- Well, Wolfie!|- Shut up.
{28594}{28675}However, his shipmates volunteered|information to the police.
{28679}{28760}Enough to send him up for 1042 years.
{28768}{28878}The Wolf has been described as a body|of man entirely surrounded by women.
{28882}{28914}- He's...|- Terrific!
{28919}{28954}Terrific.
{29034}{29085}It's just a gag, Wolfie. Just a gag.
{29089}{29161}Captain give you permission|to pull that stunt?
{29165}{29248}- Yes, sir.|- I was in on the gag too.
{29252}{29343}- Were you?|- Well, just around the edges.
{29504}{29609}- Plane coming in at the sun!|- Clear the bridge! Take her down!
{30053}{30105}- Hatch secured!|- Battle stations manned.
{30109}{30154}Main induction closed.
{30515}{30555}What was it?
{30559}{30616}Looked like a four-motor|bomber to me.
{30622}{30656}Pressure in the boat, sir.
{30920}{30982}Level off at 150 feet.
{30992}{31050}- Rig for depth charge.|- Rig for depth charge.
{31056}{31116}Close main vents.
{31132}{31166}Main vents closed, sir.
{31170}{31241}- Blow negative.|- Blow negative.
{31255}{31327}- Close negative flood.|- Close negative flood.
{31331}{31368}Negative flood closed, sir.
{31374}{31435}- Level off at 150.|- Level off at 150.
{31608}{31666}- Zero bubble.|- Zero bubble.
{31795}{31847}Open all vents.
{31952}{32036}- All ahead one-third.|- All ahead one-third.
{32060}{32110}All answering ahead one-third, sir.
{32114}{32174}- Pump from auxiliary to sea.|- Auxiliary to sea!
{32219}{32319}- Can we hear it when it comes?|- Yep, son.
{32323}{32370}We'll hear it, all right.
{32414}{32520}- Isn't there anything we can do?|- Yep. We're doing it.
{32596}{32648}Maybe it's one of our own planes.
{32656}{32720}If we sink, it doesn't matter|who drops the bombs.
{33227}{33283}Think they can see|our shadow from the air?
{33287}{33342}That's what we're finding out.
{33619}{33671}All clear, sir.
{33681}{33743}Let's go up for a look-see.|Periscope depth.
{33750}{33811}Periscope depth. Five degrees up angle.
{33815}{33895}- Twenty-degree rise on the bow planes.|- Five degrees up angle.
{33899}{33975}- Twenty-degree rise, sir.|- Take charge of your planes.
{34268}{34308}Up a foot.
{34524}{34601}Maybe that plane had feathers.
{34605}{34694}Looks as if we dunked|for a four-motored albatross.
{34698}{34777}Service, down scope.|Have a merry Christmas, men.
{34781}{34927}- Gee, fellas. I could have sworn...|- Albatross have retractable landing gear?
{34936}{34998}Lookouts to the bridge!
{35002}{35096}- You can hear that motor so plain!|- Key down. He feels bad enough.
{35612}{35680}Watch out, or they'll give you|an E for imagination.
{35684}{35731}Lay off him, Rocky.
{35735}{35767}That's all right, son.
{35771}{35863}I'd rather submerge for 100 birds|than not submerge for one plane.
{35867}{35921}Thank you, sir.
{36234}{36327}- All clear starboard.|- All clear port.
{36948}{36996}Hello, Andy.
{37000}{37078}Almost 24 hours out now, skipper.|About time to open orders?
{37083}{37140}Three minutes to go, Andy.
{37144}{37212}I got a hunch it's something big.
{37223}{37288}Last night, I dreamed|we upped periscope.
{37292}{37369}Right in the middle of|the entire Jap imperial fleet.
{37373}{37419}Passing in review.
{37423}{37506}- Did we sink them all?|- With one torpedo.
{37510}{37542}Billiard shot.
{37546}{37608}By the way, there's a man|from the forward room.
{37612}{37694}Wants to see you on a matter|of vital importance.
{37707}{37804}- Torpedoman Adams.|- Send him in.
{37955}{38069}I was told I'd have to ask you, sir.
{38130}{38172}Go ahead. Ask me.
{38176}{38270}Sir, at sub school, we saw a lot|of pictures of submariners...
{38274}{38362}...coming back from patrols with beards.
{38366}{38454}- So you want to grow one?|- Yes, sir.
{38484}{38577}- Think you can?|- Sir, I'd like to find out.
{38592}{38650}Well, I'll tell you, Adams.
{38654}{38737}First patrol, we all grew beards.|I had a pip.
{38741}{38788}The second patrol was|half and half.
{38792}{38884}Then we decided beards are itchy.|They get greasy. We keep a trim ship.
{38888}{38944}Makes sense we have a trim crew|to man her.
{38948}{38980}Yes, sir.
{38984}{39064}But I don't want to cheat you|of a beard on your first patrol.
{39068}{39150}Oh, that's all right, sir.|I only shave twice a week anyway.
{39154}{39212}If I could grow one,|it'd look a little limp.
{39223}{39303}I'll stick to shaving twice a week, sir.
{39307}{39387}Maybe when we get back,|you'll be shaving three times a week.
{39406}{39509}Thank you, sir. I guess I'd better|get back and do what I was doing.
{39513}{39560}Thank you.
{40580}{40640}Send the quartermaster|with the chart catalog.
{40649}{40729}Captain wants the chart catalog, Rocky.
{40834}{40898}- Chart catalog, sir.|- Thank you. Stand by.
{40930}{40986}- Has he come yet?|- No. He's still in there.
{41008}{41076}- Bring in chart 1291.|- Aye, aye, sir.
{41134}{41252}Just get out that old chart of Tahiti.|I got a tomato in Papeete.
{41269}{41315}Poetry.
{41665}{41725}Gonna write a letter|to your wife every night?
{41729}{41823}- Yep. Sort of keeps us in touch.|- Doesn't make sense if there's no mail.
{41827}{41871}Who knows? We might hit Australia.
{41877}{41934}Then again, we might not.
{42069}{42123}Funny thing about submarines.
{42127}{42211}The crew always knows where|we're going before the captain does.
{42581}{42623}Holy smoke! Tokyo?
{42627}{42691}I always wanted to see those geisha gals|up-close.
{42695}{42747}Too bad you didn't study|"Japany" lingo.
{42751}{42832}Listen, my kind of language|is international.
{42864}{42938}How are we going to get|into Tokyo Bay?
{42942}{43002}The Copperfin just naturally|sprouts wings.
{43006}{43060}We fly over the nets|and the minefields...
{43064}{43152}...plumb in the middle of the harbor.|- Tokyo Bay. Perfect.
{43156}{43216}Bet we sink 70,000 tons.|20 bucks, even money.
{43220}{43318}- Seventy thousand tons. You're nuts.|- Look, I got a reason to have luck.
{43322}{43372}Where I go, there's gonna be|dead Japs.
{43376}{43459}- What is this reason of yours?|- Never mind. Anybody wanna bet?
{43463}{43540}It's a secret between him and Roosevelt.|I'll take the bet.
{43544}{43592}I'll pay off double if we make it.
{43596}{43678}Only two guys whistle in the Navy.|Boatswain's mates and boots.
{43682}{43717}You a boatswain's mate?
{43721}{43781}I'm sorry, Mike. I forgot.
{43785}{43818}You hear that music?
{43822}{43903}- Reminds me of a dame I knew in Frisco.|- Here we go again.
{43907}{43978}She was built for speed,|like a destroyer.
{43983}{44065}- Oh, now I listen.|- Kind of compact too, like a submarine.
{44069}{44147}She was coming down Sutter Street.|Off my starboard beam.
{44151}{44200}I sees her and says, "Up periscope."
{44204}{44312}I gives my motor a third back and|maneuvers for an opening shot.
{44343}{44392}She picks me up on her detector.
{44396}{44486}Gives her rudder a hard left.|Makes like she's looking in the window.
{44494}{44597}Naturally, I gives my rudder|a hard right and moves...
{44601}{44703}... right up alongside her. She's beautiful.|But beautiful!
{44707}{44764}Comes up to about my chin.|Fits just right.
{44768}{44840}Well, neither of us breaks silence.
{44844}{44944}Naturally, there's a long pause.|We're both running on batteries now.
{44948}{45012}Something electric is going on between|her and me.
{45023}{45072}I'd been on patrol three months.
{45076}{45120}And this was|my first night ashore.
{45124}{45172}Now, you guys know how it is.
{45177}{45292}There she was in a nice, clean, crisp,|lacy blouse.
{45307}{45379}And she looked|just like she had a bath.
{45383}{45428}So she looked like she had a bath.
{45452}{45496}She even smelled like geranium.
{45500}{45572}So she even smelled like geraniums.|Then what?
{45576}{45676}Here we are, hove to,|with her smelling like geraniums...
{45680}{45740}...and me with three months' pay|in my whites.
{45748}{45810}- I'll never forget it!|- Never forget what, Wolf?
{45814}{45874}Some dames have lips that|are curved all right.
{45878}{45978}But when you kiss them, you find they|have lips as hard as a warhead?
{45982}{46108}Well, you could tell hers|was as soft as silk.
{46112}{46216}Just enough lipstick. Just right.
{46220}{46293}Well, what did you do about it?
{46297}{46373}I was so busy drinking her in|out of my starboard lamps...
{46377}{46486}... that I don 't see this Market Street|commando hove to alongside her.
{46490}{46558}I'm trying to get a recognition signal|out of her...
{46562}{46618}... when this sailor busts right in|and says:
{46622}{46676}"Would you like one|of those lacy things?"
{46680}{46741}She says, "Sure."|And they go in and buy one.
{46745}{46811}- Well, what did you do?|- Me? I'm murdered!
{46827}{46926}There I am, anchored,|dead in the water...
{46930}{46996}... looking in the window.|She's picking out one.
{47000}{47088}And this Market Street commando|is giving me the gloat!
{47092}{47143}Am I burnt. I'm dying!
{47147}{47221}My first night in. There she'd been,|standing next to me.
{47225}{47296}- Smelling like geraniums.|- Okay, we been through that.
{47300}{47379}This Market Street commando peels|off some lettuce and pays.
{47383}{47451}And she's smiling|as sweet as a dream.
{47455}{47562}And there I am, outside the window,|bulkheads busted in.
{47566}{47624}Next thing I know,|she gives this guy a kiss.
{47628}{47704}And the next thing I know,|she's making for my anchorage...
{47708}{47783}... with his stuff under her arm,|and she's saying to me:
{47787}{47830}"Going my way, submariner?"
{47834}{47899}Then what happened, Wolf?
{47903}{47974}She was built for speed,|but like I said, kid...
{47978}{48082}...kind of compact too, like a submarine.
{48383}{48485}According to the orders, we're to pick|up the lieutenant here at point x-ray.
{48489}{48565}A PBY boat will meet us at 1430.
{48569}{48607}Why are they flying him down?
{48611}{48691}Save us going out of our way|to pick him up. Time's important.
{48706}{48764}- Who is he?|- Aerology specialist.
{48768}{48821}North Pacific area.
{48825}{48884}All we have to do|is put him ashore in Japan.
{49015}{49074}You are showing signs|of needing a sun lamp.
{49078}{49142}From now on, sign up.|Everybody, once a day.
{49158}{49230}- You ever want to be a real doctor, Pills?|- Yeah.
{49234}{49318}I was one of those wise guys|who didn't know where he was going.
{49322}{49374}Funny place to find out, on submarines.
{49391}{49449}- What college did you go to?|- California.
{49453}{49503}Only a year. Then I signed up.
{49507}{49587}I had an A in chemistry,|so they made me a pharmacist's mate.
{49591}{49649}Ain't it wonderful what|an education will do?
{49653}{49735}When I got out of third grade,|I took a job at Coney Island.
{49739}{49810}- Frying hot dogs.|- You should have stuck to hot dogs.
{49828}{49868}Where's that half-baked barber?
{49896}{49950}You finishing college|when the war's over?
{49954}{50015}Yep. Putting my pay|and a half in war bonds.
{50019}{50073}Working my way|through college underwater.
{50113}{50198}Pills, if anything happened|to us while we're out on patrol...
{50202}{50296}...if we got conked off, you figure|we'd see our folks in the hereafter?
{50300}{50348}I wouldn't bank on it.
{50352}{50454}My old man wouldn't be overjoyed to see|me. He never thought I was much good.
{50458}{50518}- I like to think we got souls...|- I don't know.
{50522}{50606}All those guys I cut up at school,|never found a soul inside.
{50610}{50655}Well, what does that prove, Pills?
{50659}{50704}Say you trust a guy.
{50708}{50770}You can't see the trust,|but it's there.
{50774}{50859}- I'm from Missouri, Mike.|- I'm not exactly religious.
{50863}{50915}- But don't you think God...|- No, I don't.
{50919}{50976}My angle is, I only believe|what I can see.
{50980}{51039}- Are you an atheist?|- Call it what you like.
{51050}{51114}The Japs turn the heat on us,|I'll watch you pray.
{51118}{51172}I've seen it happen before.
{51208}{51264}- Say, you guys know what?|- No, what?
{51268}{51372}There's something screwy|about this detour or whatever it is.
{51390}{51422}We'll know before long.
{51426}{51512}Hey, Yo Yo, mind if I use your office?|Something private.
{51516}{51573}- Sure.|- Thanks.
{51630}{51696}That's the third time|he's asked me.
{51700}{51742}Well, maybe he's writing poems.
{51746}{51806}There you are, my little scissorbill.
{51810}{51842}Get thee behind me.
{51846}{51923}Mind you, no politics, no ball games,|no hair down my neck.
{51927}{51964}Nothing but barbering.
{52011}{52101}Well, Cookie, looks like we're getting|pretty close to enemy waters.
{52112}{52176}Now, Tommy, don't go|getting yourself all worried.
{52200}{52253}Think we ought to take the hat off?
{52266}{52321}Well, don't you think we'd better?
{52401}{52460}- Clippers?|- Yes, thanks.
{52486}{52597}You see, Tommy, there's always|one of two things about a submarine.
{52604}{52706}In the first place, either the enemy|finds you, or he doesn't.
{52710}{52782}If he doesn't find you,|there's nothing to worry about.
{52786}{52881}But if he does, there is still|one of two things.
{52885}{52944}Either he drops a depth charge,|or he don't.
{52948}{53026}If he doesn't, there's nothing|to worry about. If he does...
{53030}{53082}...then there's still|one of two things.
{53086}{53142}Either he drops it|close to you or far away.
{53167}{53231}If he drops them far away,|it's foolish to worry.
{53235}{53271}If he drops them near you...
{53275}{53353}...then there is still one|of two things to worry about.
{53357}{53399}And that is...
{53418}{53469}Don't cut too much off.
{53473}{53512}If your pressure hull holds.
{53516}{53588}Of course, if it holds,|wouldn't it be foolish to worry?
{53592}{53664}If it doesn't, you won't be able|to worry, so why worry?
{53681}{53724}Are you through?
{53737}{53775}Yes.
{53864}{53944}He was worth waiting for.|He's a good barber. That looks fine.
{53948}{53980}You next?
{54373}{54432}One thousand fathoms, sir.
{54723}{54791}Rudder amidships. Steady on course.
{54795}{54866}- Two-nine-zero.|- Eight hundred fathoms.
{54997}{55096}Right, five degrees rudder.|New course, 295. All motors stop.
{55100}{55213}Right, five degrees rudder.|New course, 295. All motors stop.
{55217}{55250}Three hundred fathoms.
{55546}{55584}Stations for battle surface.
{55588}{55628}Stations for battle surface.
{55723}{55773}Ready on all main engines.
{56075}{56119}Down scope.
{56755}{56806}All engines, ahead one-third.
{57706}{57776}Has the radio man picked|up anything on the frequency?
{57780}{57833}Contact established, sir.
{57940}{57988}Plane to starboard, sir.
{58092}{58135}Hold your fire.
{58170}{58218}Stand by to challenge.
{58227}{58259}Okay, Rocky.
{58437}{58483}Challenge.
{58817}{58879}Plane answered challenge|correctly, captain.
{58889}{58940}All stop. Rudder amidships.
{59244}{59304}Always nice to see|those stars on the wing.
{60200}{60278}You know, I'd sure like|to hook an Aleutian salmon.
{60282}{60352}Cute if I opened him up,|and there was a Jap in there.
{60356}{60410}Fried Jap in tartar sauce.
{60427}{60469}I'll take mine boiled in oil.
{60591}{60640}I'll go down and get him.
{61008}{61074}Lieutenant Raymond. McCary.|Welcome aboard.
{61078}{61128}- Thank you.|- Come up, meet the captain.
{61132}{61164}Thanks.
{61815}{61854}Lieutenant Raymond reporting.
{61858}{61916}- Glad to have you aboard.|- Glad to be aboard.
{61920}{61986}- Ready on one and two.|- You already know McCary.
{61990}{62042}- Yes, sir. We've met.|- How was your trip?
{62046}{62119}It was pretty rough.|Is my aerology gear aboard?
{62123}{62155}Under lock and key.
{62159}{62235}If you'll go below, we'll arrange|for your berthing later.
{62239}{62304}- I'd like to get this ship out of here.|- Yes, sir.
{62342}{62422}How do I get below? I've never|been aboard a submarine before.
{62476}{62524}There's the hatch. It goes down.
{62567}{62599}Yes, sir.
{62689}{62730}Hey! Bear a hand. I got a bite.
{62791}{62856}Planes approaching, dead astern!
{62924}{62967}Jap float Zeros.
{62971}{63027}All ahead full!|Ten degrees right rudder!
{63080}{63115}Commence firing!
{63327}{63364}Get him smack in the teeth!
{63701}{63734}Unexploded bomb forward!
{63797}{63829}We ought to be diving.
{63833}{63883}Got six fathoms under us.|Gotta get on.
{64234}{64284}Coming in low! Get down!
{64360}{64404}Good work, Wolf!
{64431}{64484}- Is he hurt badly?|- I think so, sir.
{64488}{64527}There he goes.
{64592}{64682}If that Nip doesn't get out of there,|he'll end up with a hot seat.
{64889}{64948}I could pop him off|with a clear conscience.
{64978}{65022}He looks awful Ionesome up there.
{65026}{65061}Okay.
{65065}{65133}The unexploded bomb is wedged|in the superstructure.
{65137}{65206}Let's have a look at it.|Larry, take the watch.
{65530}{65616}Pick up that Jap aviator.|I want to question him.
{65732}{65792}We'll have to bring out|the cutting torches.
{65796}{65836}No time.
{65884}{65923}I'll get your pigeon for you.
{65927}{65980}Okay, Mike.|We'll put him to roost.
{66255}{66321}Looks like the war|is over for you, son.
{66468}{66516}Mike!
{66824}{66877}That's enough, kid.
{66892}{66928}Where's Mike?
{66932}{66979}Dakota is taking him below.
{67166}{67252}Mike looked up like he|wanted me to do something.
{67275}{67318}I just stood there.
{67325}{67388}Me too. It happened so fast.
{67392}{67462}We need a man to pull the teeth|of an unexploded bomb.
{67466}{67524}Volunteers to the control room.
{67697}{67765}Mike would be alive now|if I hadn't just stood there.
{67769}{67830}Stow it. These things happen every day.
{67834}{67936}If you want to take it out on somebody,|take it out on the Japs, not yourself.
{67940}{67983}Come on. Let's get out of here.
{68105}{68204}It boils down to a matter of thickness.|The bomb is wedged in a tight spot.
{68208}{68266}And neither the captain|or I can get to it.
{68320}{68389}Back home, they used to call me "Slim."
{68393}{68431}You'll do, "Slim."
{68460}{68508}Take this and that off.
{68731}{68763}Your volunteer, captain.
{68792}{68836}Know what you're volunteering for?
{68840}{68882}Yes, sir. The bomb.
{68897}{68979}It's wedged under the superstructure.|That's not all.
{68983}{69087}That Jap may have radioed our position.|If planes come while we're down there...
{69091}{69146}...we'll have to drink a lot of water.
{69183}{69226}I'll go with you, captain.
{69256}{69324}Okay, Tommy. Get down below.
{69511}{69574}In case of another attack,|take her down.
{69615}{69652}Aye, aye, sir.
{69699}{69772}Clear the decks. Diving stations!
{70038}{70070}Son...
{70074}{70154}...that bomb may be a dud|because the firing pin's fractured.
{70158}{70229}If it is, the slightest jar|will set it off.
{70236}{70274}So take it very easy.
{70278}{70339}Here. You'll need this web wrench.
{70357}{70434}Tell me when you reach the bomb,|but don't touch it.
{71194}{71247}- Reached the bomb.|- Don't touch it yet.
{71251}{71318}Look carefully around|the base of the fuse.
{71330}{71424}The bomb may be a booby trap,|so it will blow up at the slightest touch.
{71438}{71547}Do you see any hammer marks|or slight indentations?
{71630}{71684}- No, captain.|- All right.
{71707}{71756}Now, very carefully...
{71760}{71792}...feel the nose.
{72132}{72168}Can you feel any marks?
{72195}{72227}No marks, sir.
{72231}{72276}Very gently now...
{72291}{72374}...place the web wrench|around the fuse.
{72443}{72504}It unscrews counterclockwise.
{72508}{72540}Right to left.
{72568}{72600}You got that?
{72604}{72641}Yes, sir. It's in place.
{72645}{72735}- It unscrews left to right, sir.|- Right to left! Right to left!
{72739}{72772}I'm sorry, sir.
{72776}{72832}I heard you all right.|I repeated it wrong.
{72836}{72888}Right to left, sir.|I'm a little nervous.
{72892}{72924}Stop and take a breath.
{72942}{72986}You're doing fine.
{73066}{73141}Well, I guess Mike|got it quicker, that's all.
{73145}{73184}Shut up.
{73188}{73260}- Talking don't bother a bomb.|- It bothers me.
{73345}{73441}Dakota, I once knew a dame who had|a temperament just like a bomb.
{73445}{73494}Laugh? No laugh.
{73506}{73584}Start unscrewing it gently.|Just use gradual pressure.
{73588}{73628}Right to left.
{73632}{73668}- Right.|- Easy.
{73672}{73722}Easy. Just loosen it.
{74033}{74096}- I've loosened it, sir.|- Now, carefully...
{74100}{74142}...remove the wrench.
{74161}{74207}Turn the fuse by hand.
{74342}{74380}Easy.
{74384}{74430}Very, very gently, son.
{74481}{74526}Easy does it.
{75237}{75305}Got "made in U.S.A." stamped on it.
{75349}{75414}The appeasers' contribution|to the war effort.
{75418}{75480}Take it and stew it, Cookie.
{75486}{75529}Adams, you did a fine job.
{75533}{75588}You earned yourself a higher rating.
{75592}{75628}Thank you, sir.
{75708}{75773}You got a great pair|of shoes to fill, Tommy.
{75963}{76016}One kid's shoe.
{76070}{76123}And one pipe...
{76127}{76160}...stem broken.
{76228}{76284}That completes the inventory.
{76491}{76551}Mike was a first-class|torpedoman...
{76555}{76599}...in more ways than one.
{76795}{76838}Where's the kid?
{76850}{76894}He went aft. He feels kind of low.
{76898}{76976}Wonder if we should have told|the exec about that package...
{76980}{77061}...Mike used to keep under his sack.|- What package?
{77072}{77105}Well...
{77109}{77169}...every time he borrowed|Yo Yo's office...
{77173}{77229}...he took it along with him.
{77412}{77471}Hey, maybe it's one|of them censored records.
{77475}{77524}Say, we could do with a laugh.
{77895}{77983}I thought Mike was acting|secret when he used to come in here.
{78158}{78193}Hello, honey.
{78197}{78277}I hope you play this record|once in a while while you're away.
{78281}{78342}It'll mean you're missing|me like I miss you...
{78346}{78417}... from the moment you shove off,|every single time.
{78421}{78540}Have I ever told you how much those|homecoming bear hugs mean to me?
{78544}{78652}Gosh, darling, you could break|all my ribs, having you back is so good.
{78676}{78764}The kids miss you and make believe|you're at the table each night.
{78795}{78865}I don 't think they know|what being married 10 years...
{78869}{78930}... to a sweet guy like you is like.
{78934}{78982}I do, thank God.
{78986}{79063}Means you've made me|the happiest woman alive.
{79086}{79147}I hope I've made you happy, Mike.
{79151}{79197}I always tried my darnedest...
{79201}{79235}... because I love you...
{79239}{79280}... with every bit of my heart.
{79826}{79880}"And whilst we consign...
{79884}{79946}...his remains to the deep...
{79950}{80046}...we the living|pray thee heavenly Father...
{80050}{80128}...to grant him eternal peace|and rest...
{80136}{80186}...through Christ Jesus, our Lord."
{80197}{80232}Amen.
{81062}{81110}Why weren't you up there?
{81181}{81220}I got no use for burials.
{81360}{81426}Oh, coffee's more important, huh?
{81540}{81616}- You don't think I care he's dead?|- Why didn't you come up?
{81620}{81703}- Sorry for that Jap?|- Shut up! I don't take that from nobody!
{81891}{81965}I'm surprised at you guys, all of you.
{81986}{82092}You ought to have sense enough|not to get such dumb ideas!
{82151}{82208}- I told you, I had my reasons.|- Bilge!
{82514}{82559}Look.
{82563}{82632}I had an uncle lived|in the old country, see.
{82636}{82703}A real high-class guy, not like me.
{82707}{82745}You know what he was?
{82749}{82803}He was a teacher of philosophy.
{82807}{82867}To be that in Greece,|the home of philosophy...
{82871}{82956}...you got to be A-number-one smart,|and that was my uncle.
{82960}{83000}So they killed him, them Nazis.
{83004}{83068}They stood him up against the wall.|You know why?
{83072}{83111}Because he had brains.
{83115}{83227}And everybody's got to be their slave.|Them that won't, like my uncle, they kill.
{83321}{83370}My old man was no good.
{83374}{83438}He was a boozer.|He died in bed having the D.T.'s.
{83472}{83549}But my uncle,|a man with education and charity...
{83553}{83609}...who used to send my ma|what to eat with.
{83613}{83703}Him, they stood up against the wall.|And that sticks in here with me.
{83707}{83755}The difference between|them and us...
{83759}{83871}...is, with us even the no-good|gets a chance to die in his own bed.
{83889}{83940}So I don't forget my uncle.
{83955}{84024}An American flier gets killed,|I think of my uncle.
{84028}{84114}I see pictures of Chinese kids|getting bombed, I think of my uncle.
{84118}{84184}A Russian guerrilla gets hanged,|I think of my uncle.
{84188}{84255}I see Mike lying in there dead,|I think of my uncle.
{84259}{84332}I ain't got room in here|to see one of our guys get buried.
{84336}{84407}Not yet. Not until I've done|something to even the score.
{84411}{84468}So I eat with it, and I sleep with it.
{84479}{84527}So be sore at me, you dopes.
{84620}{84680}- I'm sorry, Tin Can.|- Attention.
{84753}{84792}At ease, men.
{84916}{84972}- Trying to figure out about Mike?|- Yes, sir.
{85023}{85064}Well...
{85068}{85138}...officers and men on submarines|are closer together...
{85142}{85189}...than in most branches of our Navy.
{85193}{85239}Mike was with me on my first patrol.
{85252}{85316}He was my friend. I know his family.
{85328}{85400}His wife's a fine, great-hearted woman.
{85418}{85462}I know his kids.
{85496}{85623}I remember Mike's pride when he bought|the first pair of roller skates for his boy.
{85630}{85700}They were the finest roller skates|that money could buy.
{85711}{85752}Roller skates for a 5-year-old.
{85779}{85860}Well, that Jap got a present too,|when he was 5.
{85864}{85904}Only it was a dagger.
{85914}{86008}His old man gave him a dagger, so he'd|know what he was supposed to be.
{86012}{86072}The Japs have a ceremony|that goes with it.
{86076}{86184}At 7, a Jap kid is taking marches|under an army instructor.
{86188}{86272}At 13, he can put a machine|gun together blindfolded.
{86304}{86422}That Jap started on the road 20 years|ago to putting a knife in Mike's back.
{86478}{86537}There are lots of Mikes dying right now.
{86541}{86589}And a lot more Mikes will die...
{86593}{86720}...until we wipe out a system that puts|daggers in the hands of 5-year-olds.
{86739}{86779}You know...
{86783}{86843}...if Mike were here to put|it into words now...
{86847}{86905}...that's just about what he died for.
{86909}{86966}More roller skates in this world.
{86983}{87070}Including some for the next|generation of Japanese kids...
{87084}{87155}...because that's the kind|of a man Mike was.
{88176}{88257}- What's that you're reading?|- San Francisco telephone directory.
{88261}{88316}- I collect names.|- What do you do with them?
{88326}{88408}Just meditate. Wonder what kind|of people go with the names.
{88412}{88496}- Wonder what the names mean.|- Names don't mean nothing.
{88500}{88543}- Oh, no?|- No.
{88547}{88611}- Well, my name's Wainwright.|- Wainwright. So what?
{88615}{88721}My grandpa used to build wagons. A|wainwright's a guy who builds wagons.
{88725}{88776}- Like covered wagons?|- Sure.
{88780}{88846}Maybe he built some|wagons crossed the plains.
{88850}{88931}Some grandpas built houses.|Name's Carpenter.
{88935}{89009}Some grandpas made clothes.|Name's Tailor.
{89035}{89105}Some guy's grandpa built wheels|for my grandpa's wagons.
{89109}{89164}Name's Wheelwright,|a guy who builds wheels.
{89168}{89250}Sun lamp ready in the forward room.|Come on, GI sunshine.
{89254}{89332}Don't tell me the captain|finally gave up that sun lamp.
{89353}{89416}Phone books are fascinating.|I'm nuts about them.
{89420}{89478}Personally, I use phone books|for long shots.
{89482}{89555}In San Diego, I had nothing to do|and nothing on my mind...
{89559}{89592}Except skirts.
{89596}{89673}So I sees this phone book.|I flip it open. I come to a name.
{89677}{89710}Rosalie Riley.
{89714}{89797}"Pretty name," I says to myself.|"I wonder what she's like."
{89801}{89845}- So...|- So you call her up.
{89849}{89889}No. Why waste time?
{89893}{89964}I go right out to her house,|21 Valley Road.
{89968}{90029}Never forget it.|Had roses all over the place.
{90033}{90077}Very pretty. Very pretty indeed.
{90081}{90148}- Red and pink roses...|- Now we're going to pick roses.
{90152}{90247}I pick a rose. So I got something to talk|about when she comes to the door.
{90284}{90318}Up I go to the door.
{90322}{90422}I ring the bell. And I hear|a very nice voice from the inside.
{90426}{90496}"Wait a minute," she says.|"I'm in the bathtub."
{90500}{90556}Every girl you meet is in the bathtub!
{90560}{90631}I haven't met her yet. I'm on her porch!
{90645}{90696}Naturally, I sit down.
{90700}{90771}I'm rocking back and forth,|back and forth.
{90775}{90835}Skip the details.|Who cares if you're rocking?
{90839}{90900}I'm just trying to give you the picture!
{90931}{90964}We got the picture!
{90968}{91027}You're in the bathtub!|She's on the porch!
{91048}{91140}She's in the bathtub.|I'm on the porch!
{91172}{91242}She comes to the door.|My stomach flutters.
{91246}{91312}- She's beautiful!|- Now his stomach flutters.
{91338}{91436}"Oh," she says, "I thought you were|someone else. " "Disappointed?" I says.
{91440}{91484}You're there|with a snappy comeback.
{91488}{91538}She says,|"I can't ask you to come in."
{91542}{91646}"Of course not," I says, giving her pearly|teeth. "But I can ask you to come out."
{91650}{91685}What did she say to that?
{91689}{91756}Well, she didn't say anything,|that is, right away.
{91760}{91815}Then I proceeded to pour|on the personality.
{91819}{91858}Then what did you do?
{91866}{91917}Now, wouldn't you like to know?
{91921}{92000}You give me a pain in the pancreas.|You're always shooting off.
{92004}{92092}Stow it for the rest of this patrol.|Some of us have sweethearts.
{92096}{92172}Yeah?|Well, maybe some of us haven't.
{92240}{92283}Hasn't he been telling the truth?
{92287}{92402}No. You haven't been swallowing|all that stuff, have you?
{93519}{93562}Captain.
{93576}{93622}Oh, this it?
{93626}{93676}I'm afraid to take a look.
{93721}{93781}Just hope it won't be Coney Island.
{93796}{93852}Well, I got on my lucky sweater.
{94248}{94298}What's the bearing?
{94302}{94356}Zero-five-zero, captain.
{94743}{94819}Smack on the button. Take a look.
{94967}{95055}Right down Fujiyama's throat.
{95059}{95122}Nice work, Andy.|Check your tangents.
{95228}{95287}Lieutenant Raymond|to the conning tower.
{95328}{95375}Attention, all hands.
{95379}{95479}We're lying off the Japanese mainland.|Thought you'd like to know.
{95497}{95552}Just like the postcards, huh?
{95556}{95620}You get a better look inside the bay,|captain.
{95627}{95711}By the way, you think you can|get inside the net?
{95718}{95778}- That's what orders say.|- What about minefields?
{95782}{95852}- Can you see them underwater?|- Nope. I wish I could.
{95856}{95932}But if you do get in, how are you|going to get the ship out?
{95948}{96003}This is a sort of blind date, Raymond.
{96007}{96088}- We have to wait and see what happens.|- Got my tangents, captain.
{96092}{96163}Okay, Andy. Down scope.
{96196}{96274}We'll break out a chart|of the probable minefields.
{96279}{96387}Well, boys, looks as if|we have to wait for a ticket in.
{96499}{96580}This is going to be like waiting|to have your first tooth yanked.
{96613}{96669}Checking the gravity, captain.
{96723}{96804}How'd you happen to volunteer|for the submarine service, captain?
{96812}{96844}Well, when I was a kid...
{96848}{96924}...I used to get a kick|out of swimming underwater.
{96977}{97060}How's your wife feel about|your shoving off on these patrols?
{97067}{97136}The way the wives of all the men|in the services feel.
{97140}{97199}Did she know what she|was getting into?
{97203}{97240}Not when she met me.
{97244}{97302}She was a blind date.
{97310}{97370}Not quite the same as the date|we've got ahead.
{97374}{97435}It was dark. I couldn't see|what she looked like.
{97439}{97494}- You find out what she looked like?|- Yes.
{97498}{97568}You see, we have two kids by now.
{97594}{97647}I meant that night, sir.
{97651}{97689}No.
{97698}{97801}But I found you didn't need to know|what a girl looked like to like her.
{97808}{97901}I liked her voice, the things she said,|the way she laughed.
{97905}{97948}Still do.
{97956}{98024}I like the way she is with our kids.
{98046}{98094}I like everything about her.
{98118}{98178}What made you pick the Navy,|Raymond?
{98182}{98231}Well, I was born and raised in Tokyo.
{98235}{98280}Tokyo, Japan?
{98284}{98347}- You speak Japanese?|- Yes, he does.
{98351}{98422}- We expect to make good use of it soon.|- Let's hear some.
Navigator to pilot.
Five minutes to target area.
Bombs away, sir.
There's another load, you...
- Bombs all away, sir.
- Good work, men. Let's get out of here.
Matrac, we are approaching the town of Romilly.
Thank you.
- Mama?
- Yes, darling.
- Is it Dad?
- I'm not sure. You be quiet, darling.
- Mother will be right back.
- All right.
Pilot to bombardier.
Open bomb bay doors.
Oh, Jean, darling. Till we meet again.
You were to have gone with the Wing Commander, Mr. Manning, but I happen to be rejoining my outfit not far from your own destination, so they asked me to bring you down from London.
- And what is my...
- Your what, sir?
Oh, nothing, I was about to ask what is my destination.
- A military secret, no doubt.
- Sorry, sir.
I'm lost, and I admit it.
Haven't the slightest idea where we are.
Not a signpost, not a marked road.
We're somewhere near the Channel, unless I miss my guess.
Even for a war correspondent, this is pretty darned mysterious.
Interesting, though.
- Here we are, sir.
- Really?
- Yes, sir.
- We're at an airdrome?
Yes, sir, the base of the famous squad Victoire.
I can't believe it.
Where are the barracks, the wind sleeves, the tarmac runs?
How do they operate here?
Surprising, isn't it?
The French make out quite nicely.
They're an intensely practical people, sir.
- Will you get out, sir?
- Right.
- This is headquarters.
- I'll stow your bag, sir.
- Thank you. Do you mind if I take a look?
- Not at all, sir.
Well, I must say I'm surprised.
This is something new in my experience of military airdromes.
To think that all these incredible bombings come from a quiet place like this.
I suppose those cows are squadron mascots.
Yes, sir.
They've brought us any amount of luck.
They're English, of course, merely on loan to the Frenchmen, as they couldn't very well bring their own cows with them.
Jerseys, sir. The milk is excellent, if you care for milk.
It seems a strange environment for one of the deadliest squadrons in the service.
- The quiet, you mean?
- Yeah.
Oh, the French don't mind it.
As a matter of fact, they rather enjoy it.
It has a way of livening up a bit from time to time.
And now, if I may, sir,
I'll take you to the liaison officer between the Free French squadron and our own Captain Freycinet.
Come in.
- Glad to see you, Hastings.
- I've brought Mr. Manning.
Mr. Manning, Captain Freycinet.
- You're very welcome, Mr. Manning.
- Thank you.
Well, I'll leave you in each other's good hands.
What? You must stay to dinner.
There's a place laid for you.
Sorry, sir. Have to push on. Orders.
Well, goodbye, sir.
I'll have your bag put in your bunk.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Thank you, Hastings.
- Au revoir, Captain.
- Good luck to you.
- Would you like to take your coat off?
- I would, thanks.
Apéritifs will be in.
- Or would you prefer a cocktail?
- Oh, no, that's all right. Thanks.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Captain Freycinet, the purpose of my visit here...
Oh, I know the purpose of your visit.
Word came this afternoon from the Air Ministry.
You've come to see some French traitors, as Monsieur Laval would call us.
No, Captain,
I've come to see some Free Frenchmen.
To get to know them and to write about them for my news syndicate.
I think we can do with all the understanding we can scrape together in these touchy times.
Well, you can see a few of us here.
As for anything more...
Thank you.
Do you think that Marshal Pétain considers you as traitors, as well as Pierre Laval?
Evidently.
And yet I try to be charitable in my judgments, Mr. Manning.
I try to remember that
Marshal Pétain is an old man now and in the hands of the barbarians.
Á votre santé.
- You've seen him these late years?
- No, but I did once.
Years ago, during the Battle of Verdun.
He visited our squadron, which was then at Senard, at the foot of the Argonne.
You were flying in the last war?
Yes, I was a pilot in the Escadrille Lafayette.
The Escadrille Lafayette?
Why, you must have done your training with us, Mr. Manning.
Why, we're old comrades.
Here, come and have some dinner.
I, too, was a pilote de chasse in Squad 26 of the Cigognes Group.
You know, many times did I see the Indian-head insignia of your squadron on patrol.
Now we meet for the first time.
Had I known you were an old pilote of our service, we would have messed with the squadron.
Oh, that's all right.
Perhaps I can see them later.
Why, of course. They're in that room.
Have you noticed? Not a sound from them.
Remember the old days?
The laughter, the gay talk in every mess?
Phonograph going full tilt.
Now, poor devils.
We're all like that, Free Frenchmen.
We find it hard to be merry.
- I understand they're bombers.
- American Flying Fortresses.
Although, we did begin here three years ago with a few of our own Farmans.
They crossed the Channel as a unit the day the armistice was signed.
And you came with them?
My dear Mr. Manning, you flatter me.
I'm getting along, and I'm blind in one eye.
No, no, I'm nothing but a liaison officer, and I reached England by another route.
They're going out now.
Just to remind the Boche of our existence.
As soon as we finish, I'll take you down to the hangars if you like.
Thanks, I'd like to very much.
Mind the step.
Just over the rise and you can see them.
Great heavens. What is this?
Planes being pulled out of barns?
A haystack for a control tower?
Is this the same place I saw when I came in?
Do you doubt it?
Well, the hedges are gone, the trees are gone and the fields have become runways.
I don't doubt that.
That's simple. It's just magic.
- But there's one thing I can't understand.
- What's that?
- Where are the cows?
- Well, they're taking them in the hangars.
They lead the cows in and lead the planes out. Come on.
They go in as the spearhead of the attack tonight.
They go in to light up the target for the others.
Do they know it? That they'll take the murderous part of the pounding?
They'll give some in their turn.
When I think of what they have to meet in the air and from the ground, Captain, we can be glad we were flying 20-odd years ago.
Yeah.
- Will you excuse me a moment, please?
- Of course.
Again?
Yes, tonight's a special occasion.
Sort of an anniversary.
I understand. You have my permission.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
All aircraft, proceed to takeoff positions.
All aircraft, proceed to takeoff positions. Over.
V for Victor. Clear. You may take off.
Vfor Victor. Clear. You may take off.
N for Norman, take off. Good hunting.
Now we can breathe easy for a few hours, have a smoke. As for them...
What's the destination tonight?
Or is that a military secret?
Well, now they're in the air, it's not.
- Berlin again.
- Good. How many?
There'll be 2,000 bombers over the target tonight.
- Two thousand? Great heavens.
- Matrac will like that.
I've been thinking about those men, those grim determined faces.
Especially that gunner, the man you spoke to just before the takeoff.
I can't get him out of my mind.
I feel I've seen him somewhere before.
Matrac. He impressed you?
I've never seen a stronger face or a stranger one.
Not a fellow to take liberties with,
I should say.
No.
I could tell you a story about him.
I've never told anyone.
- Would you care to hear it?
- By all means, Captain.
For the moment, I'll have to ask you to keep it off the record, as you journalists say.
It's for your private ear.
Later, I think it might be told.
This is the story of a little group of whom Matrac was one.
For many years, they suffered every pain, humiliation and indignity that men can have heaped upon them.
I chanced to meet these...
Well, but let that come in its place.
To begin, I'll have to take you far away from here.
The outbreak of the war brought orders for my return to France
from service in New Caledonia.
I was forced to take passage
on the Ville de Nancy,
bound for Marseille with a cargo of nickel ore.
The Ville de Nancy was
one of those venerable tramps,
which wallow across the backwaters of the world year after year.
She wore the customary coat of rust-streaked black paint.
We had a good Breton skipper,
Captain Malo,
who knew his way around the seven seas as a blind man knows his own room.
Also, two decent mates who idolized their captain.
The companionship of such men did much
to keep the tedium of the long, slow voyage from being too oppressive.
And sometimes there were songs of home from the fo'c'sle.
Our crew was made up of hardbitten, salty old-timers,
who may have been no better than they should be,
but were French to a man.
For stokers and coal passers, we had the scum of the Earth,
mongrel dregs from every port in the tropics,
dominated by a chief engineer cut to the same pattern.
As there were but three cabin passengers, we all messed at the Captain's table.
The seat of honor was filled very amply
by a Major Duval
of the Infanterie Coloniale.
He was a dominating, narrow-minded martinet,
who had proved his courage in the last war
and had learned nothing since.
With him was his aide,
Lieutenant Lenoir.
He hung on Duval's every word, a typical yes man.
These, the first and second mates and the chief engineer,
made up our official family.
Oh, yes, there was one other.
A treacherous youth, Jourdain by name, who proved to be the wireless officer.
Latest bulletin, sir.
"A day of comparative quiet was enjoyed on the Maginot Line.
"From the German fortification across the river,
"the Nazi radio broadcast an appeal to the French soldiers
"to lay down their arms and refuse to spill their blood
"in a useless fight for the decadent democracies.
"Some martial music was also broadcast by the Nazis
"and the loyal French soldiers are understood to have booed."
What kind of a war is this?
Soldiers say boo? Soldiers of France?
I am a soldier. I fight you. I say boo?
And listening to music. Is this war?
- I can...
- Or is it a band concert?
- Kindly allow the Commandant to speak.
- I beg your pardon.
I can tell you what kind of a war.
The Germans are afraid.
- They're afraid of our Maginot Line.
- Brilliant, Mon Commandant.
- The whole truth in a nutshell.
- That's right.
They know that no power on Earth can break through it.
What are we going to do, sit there indefinitely?
Yes, we'll sit there indefinitely and even longer if that is necessary.
That is what soldiers are for, to hold the line.
I say the Maginot Line is invincible.
I say the Siegfried Line is invincible.
And what is that but stalemate?
Where does it get us?
Freycinet, I think
I'm going to like you.
Victory comes with endurance.
It came the last time, and it'll come again to the army that outlasts its opponent, the army that holds its lines five minutes longer.
And that army will be the French Army, because its officers will make it hold, because they'll hold their men in place by means of cast-iron discipline.
And what if the Maginot Line is outflanked?
Forgive me, sir, but I've always understood that in a democracy, even a soldier has the right to think.
Discipline is more essential than thought to a combat officer.
An army is not a debating society.
Its thinking is done for them by experts.
I trust the Captain does not believe himself wiser than Marshal Pétain and the general staff.
The British have a general staff, and it seems to feel as I do.
Our allies have no such blind faith in the Maginot Line.
That is because they did not build it.
They're jealous of French genius.
A nation of shopkeepers.
They wanted to sell us the cement.
Very well said, Mon Commandant.
No, do not mention the British.
The word offends me.
The British will fight.
Oh, yes. To the last drop of French blood.
Only last week the Commandant said exactly the same thing.
Only last month the same words were invented in the office of Herr Doktor Goebbels in Berlin.
- Are you accusing me of disloyalty?
- Or is it me you accuse, sir?
Please, let's not accuse anyone, neither our traveling companions, nor our allies.
Very well, I accept your apology.
You ask for my opinions, mark my words, time always proves I'm right.
This was the atmosphere in which I was destined
to make a voyage halfway around the globe.
By the time we'd reached Panama, the world we'd known was falling apart.
The Maginot Line was outflanked.
The invincible French Army was on the run.
Events were happening with alarming swiftness.
"Maginot line flanked."
Fault of our allies, sir.
British, the Belgians.
What did I tell you?
They let our line get flanked.
France can curse the day she let herself get mixed up with foreign alliances.
- Sir?
- No.
Passing through the Panama Canal,
the Ville de Nancy set her helm
for Marseille.
Two days out of Colón, the wireless buzzed continuously.
The air was full of the news of torpedoings and hostile raiders.
Ahoy, the bridge. Submarine!
- Where away?
- Thirty degrees starboard, sir.
Sound the alarm.
- What do you see?
- Some sort of suspicious craft.
Can't be sure.
- Man the guns.
- Aye, sir.
- Hold the fire.
- Aye, sir.
We'll have a torpedo in our belly any minute.
- Hold your fire.
- Hold your fire.
Well, it's no sub.
It's a craft of some sort, isn't it?
- A boat?
- Or a canoe.
See there.
That's a man.
He's alive.
Probably survivors from some torpedoed ship.
Hard starboard.
- Hard starboard.
- Hard starboard.
Slowly.
Stop. Lower a boat.
Let go of the grapple lashings.
Hurry.
Faster, faster.
Hurry.
Easy with them, men.
Pretty far gone.
I needed that.
We've been without food for 20 days.
Without water for five.
Then I won't plague you with questions right now.
Put these men in the aft house.
- Set up the extra cots.
- Aye, sir.
- Open up that door.
- Come on. Easy now.
Tell Cook to bring them some broth.
Then let them sleep.
And you might ask the men if they can spare them some clothes.
Aye, sir.
Captain Malo, what is your opinion of these fellows? Are they French?
One of them is, at least. But what would they be doing in an Indian canoe?
They are not seamen, that's plain.
If we're off the African coast,
I'd wager 10-to-1 that they were deserters from one of our disciplinary battalions.
Don't you say so, Major?
No, I do not.
Since we're not off the African coast, your reasoning lacks something of being brilliant.
Learn to examine the facts, man.
Use your eyes.
Captain Freycinet, perhaps you can do better.
If you want the facts, you'd better let the men explain for themselves.
I will, and hear a pack of lies.
You condemn them without a hearing?
Isn't that unfair?
No, it is not unfair, because I know who they are.
- You mean you've seen them before?
- No, I never saw them before this morning.
But that is immaterial, since I have certain modest deductive powers.
Lenoir was on the right track, though he lacked the logic to carry it through.
These fellows have the convict look about them.
Some of them may have served in the disciplinary battalions, but not recently.
Gentlemen, beyond a shadow of a doubt, they are fugitives from Devil's Island.
From Cayenne? Impossible.
We are at least 1,500 miles from Cayenne.
Do you mean to tell me they have made such a voyage in that small open canoe?
You don't know these fellows, Malo.
The type, I mean.
I was stationed in Cayenne a dozen years ago.
I learned the smell of the convict.
A more depraved and desperate set of scoundrels cannot be found.
No matter what your opinion,
I suggest we hear what they have to say for themselves.
As you wish.
I shall be amused at their lies and by exposing them.
- We'll see, gentlemen.
- Thank you.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.
Come to attention, you men.
You, too.
Haven't you been taught to stand in the presence of officials?
No.
Never mind. This is a free ship and not an armored compound.
I think we can all be seated.
Thank you, sir.
Well, you men seem to be a long way from home.
- You're French? The lot of you?
- Yes, sir.
What's your name?
Renault.
Perhaps these men will now tell us who they are and where they come from.
Willingly, sir.
They are gold miners from Venezuela.
Three of us, though born in France, are naturalized Venezuelans.
The other two were born in Venezuela of French parentage.
I see. Where?
Well, we were working a placer claim
300 miles up a branch of the Orinoco.
Doubtless, you've never been there, sir.
It's deep in the jungle.
You reach it only by canoe.
We heard of the war only two months ago.
- It must be a wilderness, that place.
- Oh, yes, sir. It's terrible.
There's no radio, no settlement, no civilization within 100 miles.
- How did the news reach you?
- Just by chance, Captain.
You see, there are Indian rubber gatherers in that region.
Three of them, just coming in from the coast, stopped at our camp.
Remember?
Well, so we bought a few supplies from them, among other things, an axe wrapped in a Caracas newspaper many months old.
- What paper was that?
- The Caracas Diario.
I even remember the date. November 3.
The first news of the war we heard told us of a raid from the Maginot Line in Alsace.
Very odd.
- And you were interested?
- Naturally, sir.
We are Frenchmen, just like yourselves.
- We wanted to go home and... To fight.
- Likely.
- You. What's your name?
- Matrac.
Obviously, you are the leader.
Suppose you tell us?
- I'll speak for my friend.
- Speak when you're spoken to.
Sit down, sit down.
Well? Go on.
We have no leader. We're all equal.
We're a group of free men.
- You. You who wished to speak just now.
- Thank you, sir.
You were incredulous over our attempt to return to France, and I don't wonder.
Because it was an adventure that only the deepest feelings of patriotism could inspire.
All we had, sir, was our little canoe, together with 200 ounces of gold dust.
Our plan was to sail westward to where we could catch a boat for Panama and from there to France.
But we were upset by a huge swell, and the iron box that contained the gold and our passports were lost.
We righted the boat and went on, nevertheless.
From then on, we were lost.
Helpless. No mast, sail gone, and, Mon Commandant, on my word of honor, all this happened three weeks before you sighted us.
You're one of the naturalized Venezuelans?
- Yes, sir.
- Where was your home there?
- Ciudad Bolívar.
- You at the back there.
So? You didn't catch him.
His accent is perfect.
And you have no papers of any sort?
No proof of identity?
No, sir.
As Marius so truthfully told, they're all at the bottom of the Orinoco.
I see.
All at the bottom of the Orinoco River.
- Yes.
- Very good. Very convenient.
Or is it? We shall see.
Do you have any further questions,
Captain Malo?
No, Commandant. You've asked quite enough questions for all of us.
Yes, I think I've been thorough.
- Have everything you need here?
- Thank you, Captain.
Yes, Captain.
You've been more than good to us.
Fine.
Well, Commandant,
I'm afraid they spoiled your evening.
Their story seemed perfectly plausible and straightforward to me.
Plausible, sir? It was a structure of transparent falsehoods.
I always trust my instinct, sir, never what men tell me, especially convicts.
All convicts are liars.
The Commandant has said it.
I don't believe a word of their story.
Captain Malo, I've come to a decision regarding those rogues.
- You have?
- Yes, in the first place,
- you allow too much freedom.
- What do you propose I should do?
Turn them over to the police, of course, the moment we arrive in Marseille.
If they are honest men, as you so naively suppose,
- they've nothing to fear.
- Anything else?
In the meantime, they're to be locked up in the brig.
Captain Malo, as the ranking representative of the Army of France,
I demand it.
I'm glad you remembered to call me Captain.
No one will be locked up on my ship while I command.
Man's becoming insufferable.
Fortunately, his word will not be the final one when we get to Marseille.
You're absolutely right,
Mon Commandant. The man's insufferable.
- What's our speed?
- Ten-and-a-half knots. 180 revolutions, sir.
- Full speed and 195 revolutions.
- Aye, aye, sir.
I want to reach the danger zone by nightfall.
Full speed. 195 revolutions.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Fine day.
Any day that takes us closer to France is a fine day.
I wonder. On your account, I mean.
I was coming in to tell you, to warn your men of something.
Commandant Duval is of the opinion that you and your friends have escaped from Cayenne.
Some of the others, too.
And I wouldn't be fair if I didn't tell you that I've come to the same conclusion myself.
Will you wait here a moment, please?
Will you come in, please?
Sit down.
Thank you.
Captain, Renault's told us what you said, and we've been talking here together.
There's nothing to do. It's true.
We're convicts escaped from Cayenne.
We're Frenchmen.
Convicts or not, we can kill Germans.
- What is more important than that?
- Shut up. What do you know about it?
We're as good Frenchmen as a lot who have never been sent to Cayenne.
We are not soft, us convicts.
We can kill Germans.
Keep out of this, Petit.
- Why have you told us this, Captain?
- To put you on your guard.
You're for us, then?
Yes. France needs men.
You see? I told you he would be for us.
- Even if we are convicts?
- What does that matter?
I guess it's time you heard our story.
Tell him, Renault.
Yes, but what shall I begin with?
With whom shall I begin?
Now there is Petit.
He is from Provence.
What caused him to become a convict?
- It was the love of a farmer for his land.
- You are right.
I farmed the land my father farmed and his father before him.
My wife and I planted as the seasons went by.
And then the government came, and they built a dam.
They flooded all my land.
I guess I went kind of crazy.
He ran to the control station and attempted to smash the machinery.
When the employees tried to seize him, he maimed several and killed one.
The government let me off easy.
Instead of being guillotined,
I was transported for life to Guiana.
Do you know French Guiana?
It is the most corrupt and neglected of all our colonies.
There in the steaming equatorial climate, there're 5,000 or 6,000 men just like us,
struggling against the heavy undergrowth in the very depths of the jungle.
Slaves half-naked in the forests,
tortured by heat and humidity, mosquitoes, fever, rotten food.
Men die or else go insane.
Here you might have found Petit laboring to build a road.
I will tell you about this road.
The convicts call it Route Zero, because it will never exist.
Already it has been under construction for more than half a century,
and for that, there is exactly 16 miles to show.
And for those 16 miles, there is one dead convict for every yard.
Not far from where Petit worked, you might have run across Garou
working in a mahogany camp at Charven.
Formerly a mechanic and a professional racer of motorcars,
he had killed his sweetheart during a lover's quarrel.
In certain circles, it was considered crude of him to accomplish this end with an axe.
Well, of course, since then Garou has reformed.
He's learned discipline. Haven't you?
Cayenne is a very good school for that.
And now, as a pleasant diversion, may I please introduce myself?
As you may already have discovered,
Mon Capitaine, I'm a very clever man.
And sensitive.
Sensitive down to my fingertips.
In fact, these fingers made me the best safecracker in Paris and a virtuoso among the pickpockets.
Oh, they had such a delicate touch, and from the purses of the rich they brought forth brilliant symphonies as from a piano.
Your story is a delightful diversion, my friend.
But one doesn't tell a glib story with a dry tongue.
You will find a bottle of cognac in my cabin.
- Thank you. What else might I find?
- I'll take a chance.
Now tell me about yourself.
I'm a deserter of the Army of France.
In the last war, at the age of 16, I enlisted.
Three months later, I ran away.
I discovered a terrible thing about myself.
I was a coward.
Later I went to Morocco to enlist in the Foreign Legion in an effort to redeem myself, but I got arrested.
You see, even a deserter and convict can love his country, Captain.
Can you imagine, then, my feelings,
when during the long years of my imprisonment,
I had to watch every morning the tricolor being raised?
Soon I discovered that there was another who every morning looked at the flag,
the sight of which seemed to him like a benediction, like a sacrament.
I came to feel a strange kinship with this man,
because every morning we did the same thing at the same time.
The convicts, we called him Grandpère.
He was a libérés, a free man.
That is, he had served his sentence, but was not permitted to leave the colony.
Since Cayenne offers no employment for free men,
the lot of these libérés was hopeless.
But Grandpère was more resourceful than most.
He became a catcher of butterflies, for which the Guianas are famous.
The goods he made from these, he sold to the tourists,
and the butterflies themselves to collectors.
Thus, franc by franc and sou by sou,
Grandpère was able to put together a little sum.
For Grandpère had a plan and a hope.
The same plan and hope of all of us.
Escape.
Hold it, you. This is a closed road.
We're not guarding butterflies.
I heard there was a special big kind up here.
- I forgot it was a toll road.
- These are cheap cigarettes.
They won't be when you sell them to the convicts.
Hi, Grandpère.
- How is it with you and your butterflies?
- How is with you and your mosquitoes?
I wish they were pigs of Germans.
- What did you say?
- Just what I said.
The old man asked you a simple question,
Petit.
I said I wish I was in France killing pigs of Germans instead of mosquitoes.
You mean that you'd fight for our country if you were free?
Sooner than most, I swear it.
Not sooner than me.
There is only one thing I hate more than a guard, and that's a Nazi.
How about you?
What are you, a recruiting officer?
Or is this a cross-examination?
I'm just asking him. Well?
I'm a patriot, to answer your question.
And my friend over there, Marius, he's a patriot, too.
You see over there by the guard?
He is very clever. Everything there is to know about bribery, Marius knows.
He would be a very useful man if one were planning an escape.
Maybe.
- There is no escape. Don't talk about it.
- We are silly to even listen.
Old man just play games with our mind, that's all.
But I have heard he has money, lots of it.
Well, that's different.
That's something else again, eh, Marius?
Yeah, that would be different.
You there.
This fellow got lost in the swamp.
I told him he could spend the night with you.
What's this, a hotel?
We're crowded already.
Thank you. Thank you, my friends.
What are you doing here?
I paid the Sergeant for your company.
And I brought you a present.
- What is all this talk about being lost?
- There had to be an excuse.
You said you would fight for France.
So she must mean something to you, in spite of you being here.
I thought it would be nice to drink together and talk about home.
- Oh, that's a crazy idea.
- I think about my home all the time.
- My farm and my old woman.
- Yes, a farm is good.
There is nothing better than the good French soil.
No, I'll take Paris any day.
Montmartre and Moulin Rouge,
Bal Tabarin and the women. The women.
Paris isn't France.
I like the open country.
Long white roads and green trees.
The most beautiful place in the world.
Lorraine.
For me, France will always be the great tradition.
Versailles, Joan of Arc, statues and monuments.
Napoleon sleeping in greatness in the Invalides.
Place Vendôme.
Tradition that was too big for a boy of 16, who was ashamed to find himself a coward.
If it were to cost my life, I...
It would be a small price to pay to redeem myself.
I would fight and die gladly to make France free.
Who wouldn't?
I am past 65.
But if we can make sure that here are four Frenchmen at least who feel as I do about our country, who, if they had the chance, would fight for France.
If I can convince myself to believe you,
I might...
- You might what?
- I might, even though I'm an old man, still find a way to serve my country.
- But, tell me again, if you were in France...
- We would fight.
But what kind of talk is this?
We're not in France.
We're in this stinking hole.
What do we do? Grow wings to fly with?
- Or do we walk across the Atlantic?
- A canoe might be bought.
A canoe might float down the river to the sea.
A ship might be boarded.
- Listen, old man, if you're joking with us...
- I'm not joking.
I want to be sure that you are the men.
How many I've talked to before.
Can I take a chance on you?
Are you lying to me?
Have you the courage to beat the river and the sea?
Well, if we haven't, I know one who has.
And if he would be with us...
You know him.
- His name is Matrac.
- Can he get us through the swamp?
- That is the main thing.
- I know the swamp like my own hand.
- But the river and the sea?
- Matrac knows the ocean.
He escaped once in a canoe to Venezuela, but they sent him back.
- Is this man a patriot?
- Yes, he is a patriot.
A greater patriot than any of us can ever hope to be.
I swear it, he fought the Nazis long before there was a war.
It was in 1938, during the Munich Crisis.
Daladier has just returned by plane from Munich where he, a Frenchman, betrayed France to the enemy.
That's fantastic enough in all conscience, but an even more fantastic thing has just happened right here at the airport. You getting that?
Go ahead.
Instead of being torn to pieces by an outraged mob,
the mob welcomed him home a hero.
It's unbelievable.
From where I'm phoning, I can see the litter of flowers on the runway where the crowd pelted him not with stones, mind you, but with flowers.
It's incredible, unbelievable.
Raoul? Can you print that?
Jean, please get out.
Jean! Jean!
Jean, it's no use!
Everything I've worked for smashed to bits.
Did you see the them, the police?
The dirty Fascist flunkies.
Jean, it may be hard right now, but you must remember that they are still Frenchmen who believe in the things we believe in.
They stood there, just stood there watching, just to make sure a good job was done.
Darling, you've been driving yourself too hard. You need some rest.
I know the place, Jean. Romilly. You said you wanted to go back there someday.
- Romilly?
- Yes. Remember?
Remember where it was we first met?
Right over there, beyond that bend.
This is the very spot.
You were wearing one of those big floppy yellow hats and a basket on your arm.
Is that all? Must have been a warm day.
How long has it been, Jean?
Oh, when I think of what's happened, it seems like a century.
Well, don't think about it.
You know, you're a lot prettier now than you were then.
Really?
Wonder why we never thought of getting married.
Oh, I've thought of it, Jean, very often.
But I had a rival.
France.
That's ancient history.
Think it's too late?
How's the knee these days, Jacques?
Ça Va, Monsieur Le Maire, if you do not complain about it.
Now his two sons, both soldiers.
- Monsieur thinks there'll be another war?
- Will be?
We've already lost the first three battles, the Rhineland, Vienna and Munich.
- But in a military way?
- Jean, no politics.
Madame is right.
No politics tonight, of all nights.
I guess I can still bend my knees.
They won't crack.
Happy?
- To us.
- Together always.
It's funny how much more you can say with a few bars of music than a basketful of words.
Jean?
- Let's go.
- Why? What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- You look as if you'd seen a ghost.
- Oh, I'm just a little tired from shopping.
- All right.
You know, you're a funny girl.
We just about get unpacked and settle down, and you wanna pack up and run away again.
I'm going to get my wedding trip in while I can.
Jean?
Remember the boat trip we said we'd take someday?
You wanted to do a series of stories on South America.
Yes. Guatemala, Peru.
- Seems like a long time ago.
- You know, we could still do it.
We could get visas in Marseille for Portugal and sail from...
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Crazy kids.
- Oh, I can't...
- Look now. You can look now. Come on.
They missed us by that much.
- I can't go on any longer.
- Oh, come on, Paula.
I tell you it's all over.
Nobody got hurt.
It's not that, Jean.
What are you talking about?
Darling, you've got to get away.
They're looking for you.
Who's looking for me?
What are you talking about?
The police.
You're wanted, Jean, for murder.
Yes.
There.
I'm not gonna run away.
There still must be some justice left in France.
But, Jean, don't you see that the same people who can pay for riots and killing can hire courts, judges and juries?
They can't get away with it, the dirty, murdering...
Please, darling, if you love me.
There's still room for the truth.
But you can't print the truth on a smashed press.
No, but I can still talk.
I'm going back and stand trial.
I've got to.
But you won't prove anything.
You'll get yourself killed.
I want you to fight, Jean, not be a martyr.
It's not just us, our lives, it's the life of our country.
If we get away, go to America or somewhere, we can do something about it.
We can shout the truth and tell people what's going on.
Jean, please.
All right, we'll go.
Jean?
Jean? Are you awake?
- Jean!
- Here I am. Out here.
Oh, darling. I was so frightened.
I couldn't sleep.
I tried not to wake you.
- Monsieur Matrac?
- Yes.
You're under arrest.
"For the crime of inciting a riot and for complicity in the events
"which led to the death of one Raoul Dulaine
"and for other traitorous acts against the Republic of France,
"I sentence you to 15 years
- "in the penal colony of Guiana."
- Oh, Jean!
I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting.
Can you doubt that this man is a patriot?
No. He is a great patriot.
He's the man to lead us.
But where is he? Where can we find him?
He's in solitary.
He will be there for another two months.
What was his offence?
Well, there was a letter from someone very dear to him at home.
One of the guards made a dirty joke and dropped the letter in the mud, so Matrac knifed him.
Two months?
Men have gone mad in the château in two days.
Not Matrac.
Marius could get word to him of our plans.
Sure, and he would be worth waiting for, even it were two years.
Here on St. Joseph's Isle, there's a building like nothing else in the world.
One can go mad in these pits.
Nothing to see except blank walls.
Nothing to think about except escape.
No sound except the beat of one's own pulse.
Slowly one's mind, like one's body and soul, gives way.
Then, when this happens, one is put on the mad side of the barracks.
Until this happens, one may remain in the cells of the other half,
where men are not mad, but only going mad.
Here for long months had been Matrac, the man I had sworn was a patriot.
Because of his intense and fiery nature,
imprisonment was especially bitter to Matrac.
But somehow, slowly and bitterly,
the days of his solitary confinement went by.
French justice.
Beautiful, decadent France.
A country that gives birth to a bunch of rotten Fascist panderers.
I hate France.
He's talking to himself all the time now.
He'll soon be crazy like the rest of them.
Not me, my friend.
You will pay special attention to Monsieur Matrac.
He's a famous person, friend of politicians.
He has influence, as you see.
You're as rotten as the France that pays you.
If any letters come for Monsieur Matrac, you will see that they are delivered at once.
Monsieur Matrac does not like to be kept waiting.
Now you'll get it.
Incorrigible.
Matrac? Marius.
- Hey! What are you doing there?
- Nothing.
This, then, was the man we had selected to lead us.
By the time he returned from the rock, everything was in readiness.
Clever Marius had even gotten himself assigned keeper of our barracks.
Grandpère was waiting for us with a canoe in the swamps of the Maroni.
This was the night.
Everything was in readiness.
With any luck at all...
Tonight before 10:00.
I'm going, too.
- Where?
- With you.
- There's no room.
- Unless I go, I squeal.
All right, Bijou, you go.
We waited in the semi-darkness.
9:00.
9:30.
Five minutes to 10:00.
One minute to 10:00.
Bijou.
- Where is Bijou? I don't see him.
- He changed his mind.
- Hi, Grandpère.
- Grandpère.
You made it.
No, we didn't.
We are still back in the barracks.
Save your jokes.
- So you're Grandpère?
- And you're Matrac.
I'm glad you're going to lead us back to fight for our country.
Well, we better shove off.
Hey, be careful with that paddle.
Each time you splash, we ship water.
I can't help it. The boat is overloaded.
If we have to bail now, what's going to happen when we hit the rough water of the ocean?
We'll be swamped.
Stop yapping.
We'll have to take that chance.
It's getting light.
We'll get off the river and hide out on that sand spit.
Put out to sea tonight.
Four.
Five.
- We are one too many.
- Yes.
If Bijou had come onboard, we would all be at the bottom of the river by now.
I know what the rest of you are thinking.
- I am the heaviest.
- That's right.
Well, it's hard luck, Petit, but you are elected, isn't he, Matrac?
What, leave Petit when we're going home to kill Germans?
What do you say to that, Grandpère?
Whoever stays, it can't be him.
- But he weighs more than any of us.
- So he does.
Well, speak up, Grandpère.
It's your canoe.
That's right. If it wasn't for Grandpère, none of us would be going.
And who did he speak to first?
Not to you. You weren't even there.
What's that got to do with it?
I'm smaller than any of you.
Even Garou weighs a good 10 pounds more than I do.
You weigh enough to lighten the canoe all that's needed.
- Yeah? And who got the word to Matrac?
- Shut up, the bunch of you.
You...
Well, Grandpère?
Lads, Petit is going and the rest of you with him.
It's me that stays.
- No. You? Never.
- Let him finish.
- What's the idea?
- Well, you see, lads, it's this way.
For 35 years, I thought that the one hope of my life was to escape.
Yeah, that's what I've thought.
And when this came, it looked like my last chance.
I'd never have another.
But, when it gets right down to it,
I suddenly find that I'm afraid of the sea.
Yeah, and I'm scared.
That's the plain truth.
I thought I'd have enough courage to make this voyage, but I see now I haven't.
You lie, Grandpère.
You, a coward?
I would swap my guts for yours any day.
All right, all right, maybe I could stand the voyage if it came right down to it.
But the fact is, I've changed my mind.
I don't want to go.
This place is kind of a home to me now.
I'd miss it.
You lie, Grandpère.
Listen to me. You, too, Matrac.
It's my canoe.
Who goes in my canoe is up to me to say.
And I say it's you that goes and me that stays.
I'm past 65.
I'm too old to fight.
That was the idea of getting away, wasn't it?
Or was it?
I've got your promise on that.
I think I'd like to have it again, kind of formal.
Not just nods, but words, like you would speak in church, maybe.
- You want us to say our beads?
- Shut up, Marius.
What words?
I don't exactly know when it comes down to it.
I'll have to make them up as I go along.
First, get up, all of you.
Raise your right hand.
That's to begin with.
This is between you and me.
Now first you say "I," and then your name.
I...
Promise that I will do everything in my power...
"Promise that I will do everything in my power."
...to reach France, our country...
"To reach France, our country."
...our mother country we love in fair weather or foul.
"Our mother country we love in fair weather or foul."
I promise to fight for her...
"I promise to fight for her."
...to the last drop of my blood.
"To the last drop of my blood."
I guess that's all, except to get in the boat and not waste any more of this good wind.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Good luck.
So you see we have gone through quite something to get this far, Captain, and nobody is going to make us turn back now, if only for the little old man who didn't get to come with us.
Yes, Grandpère is the real hero of our story.
I agree with you.
That was a good oath you swore with the old man.
- I wouldn't want to be the one to break it.
- It will not be broken.
We trust each other.
Well, we've talked all night.
- You men should get some sleep.
- Now, wait.
- Are you going to help us?
- Yes. I'll speak to Captain Malo.
He agrees with me that no soldier is unwelcome to France.
All hands on deck. All hands on deck.
All hands on deck. All hands on deck.
Men,
I have just received a wireless message which is of concern to all of us.
"June 23.
"France, under the leadership of Marshal Pétain,
"has signed an armistice with Germany.
"According to reports, an emergency government has been set up in Vichy,
"and is negotiating with the Germans.
"It is agreed that the Nazis will occupy the capital
"and that Hitler will make a triumphant entry into Paris."
I will not try to express the common feelings of all of us on this blackest day in the history of our motherland.
As further details are received, they will be posted on the bulletin board.
You will now carry on with your duties.
- Take the altitude.
- Yes, sir.
Well?
I'm worried, Captain Freycinet.
I want your advice.
About what?
If I follow my orders and go to Marseille, you'll see what will happen.
My ship and her cargo will fall into hands that are friendly to Berlin.
You can imagine how delighted the Germans would be
- with a gift of 6,000 tons of nickel ore.
- Yeah.
Well, they're not going to get it or the Ville de Nancy, either.
When the watch changes,
I'm altering our course for England.
Fine.
What about Duval?
He is to know nothing about it.
The new course will be kept a secret.
My mates will know, naturally.
They'll be as pleased as yourself.
I can count on every one of the seamen, but the engine room, they're not to be trusted, least of all, the Chief.
You know how he hates the English.
What's your opinion of the convicts?
In the event of trouble, will they be with us?
- To a man, I think.
- To a man, except Matrac.
And where he leads, they follow.
Did you see him when we got the news?
I'm not too sure of him.
I'd stake my life on him.
I don't know why, but I feel I know my man.
At heart, he's a Frenchman, more than any of them.
More than any of us, perhaps.
- I'll have to take your word for it.
- I think you can.
Captain Freycinet?
- May I ask you something, sir?
- What is it?
Can you persuade Captain Malo to reach Marseille at night?
Marseille? Why do you ask?
So I can swim ashore.
I don't trust this Major Duval.
- Yes? Why not?
- He'll radio the police.
I've been fighting his kind all my life.
I know what to expect.
There are many ways to serve your country, Matrac.
What if you didn't reach Marseille?
I've got to reach Marseille.
I don't care about my country.
The France you and I loved is dead,
Captain.
She's been dying for a long time.
I saw her die in the Rhineland and in Munich.
Now that her death is complete,
I can stop lying and tell the truth.
I'm trying to get back to a woman.
I never intended to fight.
I know about Paula and all that you've suffered.
But the France that you and I love, Matrac, is at war.
If you won't fight, why should we help you escape?
I'll leave that to your conscience.
Your wife is waiting for the man who went away, the man who loved his country, the patriot.
Would you betray such a woman?
I leave that to your conscience.
Imperceptibly, we swung northward,
marking a course that would take
the Ville de Nancy to England.
But could the secret be kept?
On the morning of June the 26th,
I was awakened by the profound silence which had settled over the ship.
I attributed this to the old cause, engine trouble, and thought no more about it,
except to wonder how long we'd be adrift this time.
Fortunately, the sea was calm.
I rang for the mess boy.
As yet, I had no suspicion that anything was wrong.
Then I noticed that my pistol was missing from its holster.
What the devil do you mean?
Open this door.
What's the meaning of this?
Who locked my door?
- I did, sir.
- For what reason?
Commandant Duval's orders.
You're to come with me.
- Where's Captain Malo?
- You'll see him, sir.
Go on.
Come on!
What the devil is the meaning of this?
Captain Malo, I understand our course has been changed.
- Have you received new orders?
- That's my business, sir.
I've studied your chart.
We're no longer heading for Marseille.
- Correct, sir.
- For what reason?
On our present course, we run the greatest risk of being picked up by a British destroyer.
Would you consider that such a calamity?
I would consider it a great misfortune, certainly.
France has no ships to spare for England.
You'd prefer the Germans to have her, perhaps?
I prefer to be a realist. We've argued these matters before, Captain Malo.
Now we'll settle them with the only argument that means anything. Force!
Take him down with the rest.
Men, a new order has been born in Europe.
France has been given the privilege of becoming a part of it.
The watchword of this new order is discipline.
From now on, you will navigate this ship under my command until we reach Marseille.
- This is piracy, Duval.
- And your action is treason.
I'm willing to let both questions be decided by the authorities at home.
But I'm a reasonable man.
If I give you your liberty, will you give me your word of honor
- to take this ship back to Marseille?
- Certainly not.
You may control the ship, but you'll never bring her into port.
No decent seaman would serve you.
The men will do well to consider.
Those who cooperate will be given rewards and security in the new France.
I speak especially to you convicts.
To every man who helps bring this ship to Marseille,
I promise a full pardon and favor of the Vichy government.
Don't move! Hold it, men! Hold it!
Take your stations and prepare to get underway.
Confine the engine-room crew below decks,
- and see that they do their work.
- Aye, aye, sir.
And no more nonsense.
Lead them below! Lively, men!
- Get going!
- Move on.
Get below.
Get down.
- Good work, men.
- It was a pleasure, Mon Commandant.
- Are there any killed?
- No, sir.
Good.
Obviously, some skulls are too thick to damage.
Have Duval and his yes man locked in a cabin for the rest of the voyage.
Aye, aye, sir.
You two, up on the B Deck.
Thank you, Matrac.
Clear the deck. Hook up the boom, guys.
Lend a hand, men.
All right, grab ahold.
You'll regret this, Malo. The day will come when you'll bitterly regret it.
Quiet, men. Quiet.
The dirty rat is giving our position.
Commandant, let me have him.
Carry out the orders.
- Turn to.
- Turn to.
- Motors.
- A plane.
I can't see it.
- Man the guns.
- Man the guns there.
Man the aft guns.
You men, take cover.
Hurry up, you men, take cover!
Look, they're still alive.
Matrac, what are you doing?
Stop it! Stop it, Matrac!
What are you doing?
You cannot assassinate helpless men!
Look around you, Captain, and see who are the assassins.
We finished them.
We've shown the dirty Germans.
It was great, what you did.
We all did it.
I just happened to get to the gun.
We'll destroy them all, won't we?
Just like we got this plane.
Drive them out of France.
Of course we will.
Well, we got the ore to England, and very glad they were to get it.
- Got the men there, too.
- They weren't interned?
Oh, no. We all stuck with the story they were survivors from a torpedoed ship.
I remember this Matrac now.
His paper was small, but every journalist in Europe admired the fight he put up against appeasement in the Munich sellout.
He still fights.
The bombs they're dropping tonight are editorials the Germans will understand.
There are so many questions on the tip of my tongue.
Has Paula rejoined her husband?
Did he ever see his son?
- Never, but he visits them often.
- But how, if he's never seen them?
Well, he visits them in a strange way.
Often when he's on a bombing mission, he drops them a letter in a weighted steel tube.
When you saw him tonight, he was asking permission to turn 92 degrees south to Romilly to drop such a letter.
So, you see, they're not actually separated.
I beg your pardon, Captain.
The reports are beginning to come in now.
- Flights returning.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
Would you care to walk down to the hangar?
Why, yes, of course.
Tell me, Captain, what happened to the other men?
I know Matrac's here, but where are the others? Where's Captain Malo?
He's in command of a minesweeper manned by French seamen.
They work in the Channel. Often,
I suppose, in sight of their homeland.
- And Garou?
- Oh, you'll see him.
Step down, Garou.
Manning, this is Corporal Garou.
How are you, Corporal?
He's the best mechanic in Great Britain,
French or English.
Give him some scrap iron, a bit of wires, some old aluminum pots and pans, and he'll make you a plane in three hours.
You exaggerate, Mon Capitaine.
It would take me four hours at least.
And what of Petit?
He's a tireless member of our ground crew, often working 18 hours a day.
There he is now, over there by the crane.
Well, Manning,
I think that accounts for the lot.
All but one. What happened to Renault?
Not a sign of the old fear.
He's the pilot of the plane in which Matrac is flying tonight.
They're coming, Mon Capitaine.
C for Charles, landed 04:17.
C for Charles, landed 04:17.
F for Freddie, landed 04:23.
F for Freddie, landed 04:23. Over.
N for Norman, landed 04:36.
N for Norman, landed 04:36.
Who got the big oil tank?
Was it you, Rocroi?
Of course, who else?
Many thanks for the lights.
We made good use of it.
- Heil Hitler.
- We gave him heil tonight.
Mr. Manning, this is Squadron Leader Dompierre.
Hi there, Mr. Manning.
- How about a smoke?
- Yes, please.
- Where is Renault?
- Oh, he'll be along.
Why don't you turn in, Dompierre?
I'll let you know as soon as they've landed.
No, I'm fussy as an old hen with one chick missing.
V for Victor, come in.
V for Victor, come in. Over to you.
- There is no reply, sir.
- Keep trying.
V for Victor, come in.
Vfor Victor, come in. Over to you.
V for Victor, come in.
All planes accounted for except Renault's.
You gave him permission to leave the formation.
- His plane took a lot of punishment.
- Yeah.
I'm afraid, Matrac, we can't make Romilly.
We have to turn back to the base.
Sorry, Matrac.
Now you make your wish and blow out your candles.
All right.
Is it bad to make a bad wish?
Yes, Jean.
Even if it is about Hitler?
Well, it's better if you make a good wish.
All right, then.
I'll make a wish about Daddy. I wish...
Oh, you mustn't tell me your wish, or it won't come true.
I'll know what it is, anyway.
Now come on closer, and blow them as hard as you can.
All right.
- There.
- I did it!
Now I'll really grow up to be like Daddy.
I'm not supposed to say.
Oh, well, that's all right, darling.
You've got your wish already, anyway.
You're like him in many ways.
You have his eyes.
You have his nice hands.
I hope you have his heart.
Was it the best heart in the world?
I'll bet it was.
Oh, it is a very good heart, Jean.
A tender heart to be in such a rugged body.
You know, you can thank God if you grow up to be like him.
Can I eat my cake now?
Put your napkin on like a good boy. There.
- Daddy?
- Maybe. Let's look.
Come on, darling.
- Is it Daddy? Are you sure it's him?
- It may be.
- I think it is.
- But he wouldn't miss today, would he?
- Does he know it's my birthday?
- Yes, dear, he knows.
But they've gone past, Mama.
- I don't see anything. Do you?
- No, dear.
He didn't fly over.
Perhaps it wasn't him.
Ears like a dog.
Vfor Victor to Fox. We're coming in.
Two motors gone.
Limited control. Casualty.
Victor in trouble.
Stand by, ambulance and crash truck.
- Stretcher-bearers.
- Who?
Beaumont is hit.
Hurry, he's bleeding all over the place.
- Anyone else?
- Yeah, Matrac.
He got two Messerschmitts.
He didn't get the third one.
It was for his kid's birthday.
We couldn't make it.
My comrades,
I can think of no more fitting last words for our friend than those which he himself wrote as his last words and wasn't able to deliver.
"My dear son,
"today you are 5 years old, and your father has never seen you.
"But someday, in a better world, he will.
I write to you of that day.
"Together we walk, hand in hand.
We walk and we look.
"And some of the things we see are wonderful,
"and some are terrible.
"On a green stretch of ground are 10,000 graves,
"and you feel hatred welling up in your heart.
"This was, but it will never be again.
"The world has been cured since your father treated
"that terrible abscess on its body with iron and fire.
"And there were millions of healers who worked with him
"and made sure there would be no recurrence.
"Their deadly conflict was waged to decide your future.
"Your friends did not spare themselves and were ruthless to your foes.
"You are the heir
"of what your father and your friends won for you with their blood.
"From their hands, you have received the flag of happiness and freedom.
"My son, be the standard-bearer of the great age they have made possible.
"It would be too tragic if the men of goodwill
"should ever be lax or fail again to build a world
"where youth may love without fear,
"and where parents may grow old with their children,
"and where men will be worthy of each other's faith.
"Take care of your mother, Jean.
"I hold you in my arms. I kiss you both.
"May God keep you and love you as I do.
"Good night and Au revoir till our work is finished.
"And until I see you, remember this.
"France lives. Vive la France."
That letter will be delivered.
English
Hello, my baby
Hello, my honey
Hello my ragtime man
Send me your kiss by wire
Baby, my heart's on fire
If you refuse me
Honey, you'll lose me
Then you'll be left alone
Oh, baby, telephone
And tell me I was your own
Hello, hello, hello there
Hello, my baby
Hello, my honey
If you find anything in there, brother,
I'll share it with you.
Send me your kiss by wire
Baby, my heart's on fire
If you refuse me
Honey, you'll lose me
Then you'll be left alone
Oh, baby
What kind of a vessel is it?
A schooner bound for the Japanese coast.
What's its cargo?
- I'm only asking you to sail on it, not to buy it.
- I've been tricked before. What's its cargo?
It's a seal hunter. Now, if the catch is good, there'll probably be a bonus in it for you.
What's the name of the vessel?
The Ghost.
Wait a minute. It isn't easy for a sailing man to get a berth these days.
- With steam cutting down on the size--
- Get out of my way.
- Sixty a month, sailor. That's good pay.
- Yeah, if you live to collect it.
You're not afraid of hard work, are you?
Hard work?
No work is hard as long as you can remain a human being while doing it.
I wouldn't sail on a ship like the Ghost...
...if she were the only sailing vessel left on the Pacific Ocean.
Rosie, you are my posie
You are my heart's bouquet
Come out here in the moonlight
There's some sweet fine love
I want to say
Your honey boy, I'm waiting
Those ruby lips to greet
Don't be so aggravating
My blushing Rosie
My Posie sweet
It's all right, brother. They've gone.
- Who?
- The coppers.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- All right. Forget I said it. I'll buy you a drink.
Two.
- Why?
- Oh, I just don't like to drink alone.
Sailor?
I've been on a ship.
Well, here's how.
Hey.
You don't have to slip me a mickey to get me on your boat.
I'll ship on the first and quickest one out of here.
Hey you. You're the fellow who signed on for the Ghost?
- Yeah.
- Come on down.
- Drunk?
- Yeah.
Now, I wonder how that happened.
Don't pay him no mind. He's drunk.
How else do you think we got men to sail aboard a hell ship like the Ghost?
Do you think they're all fools like you are?
- Shut up, Cooky.
- I'll not shut up.
Let the chills fear run up his spine, like they did mine...
...when I made my first voyage aboard the foulest ship in creation.
Oh, you'll have a lovely time aboard the Ghost.
I won't tell you again, Cooky.
At night, you'll go to sleep praying for the morning...
...and during the day, you'll pray for the night.
But there's one thing you'll pray for most of all...
...to tear out with your own fingers the cold, merciless heart of Wolf Larsen.
I said, shut up.
Well?
I beg your pardon.
Listen, two men, they're coming out here.
They'll ask questions.
You'll say you know me.
I'm a friend of yours.
My name's Maud. Maud Webster.
We're going to San Francisco to visit some friends.
Now, can you remember that?
Maud. Maud Webster.
- But--
- Oh, please.
What's your name?
Van Weyden, Humphrey Van Weyden.
Humphrey Van Weyden.
I'll remember that.
Talk to me. Say anything, please.
- Yes?
- This woman is--
- What about her?
- She's with you?
I fail to see why I have to answer any of your questions.
Before you say anything,
I'd like to remind you...
...that it's a criminal offense to aid an escaped convict.
That's funny.
The woman looks just like me.
Doesn't she, Humphrey?
It's lucky I'm with you.
Otherwise, these gentlemen would arrest me, and you'd have to come to the police station...
...and go through all sorts of trouble trying to explain to them....
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.
It's the law.
That's right, the law.
- I wanna remind you that it's a criminal offense.
- That'll be enough.
You'll wait in his cabin until we reach San Francisco.
- Hard to port.
- Hard to port.
Don't!
Help.
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Is anybody here?
Is anybody here?
This man lying here?
That's the first mate. I think he's dying.
- Dying?
- Yeah. He always had a weak heart.
I guess all the rum he lapped up in Frisco did him in this time.
The old man will be awful mad if he croaks.
Good first mates are hard to find.
Nobody even seems to care.
They act as though his death were a matter of course.
Well, mister, onboard this ship, you might say it is.
I'm the man who was picked up out of the bay. I'm deeply grateful.
He's dead, sir.
"He's dead, sir"?
My mate's dead.
You dirty, drunken sot, you die too easy.
The rum should've first withered your limbs, rotted away your flesh, eaten out your eyes.
The man is dead, sir.
Man? Heh.
That's not a man any longer.
That's just a lump of rum-soaked flesh.
- Svenson?
- Aye, sir?
Get your palm a needle and sew the beggar up.
You'll find some old canvas in the sail-locker.
- What'll I tie his feets in?
- We'll see to that.
- Aye, sir.
- Cooky.
Yes, sir. Sir.
- Go below and fill a sack with coal.
- Yes.
Any of you fellas got a Bible or a prayer book?
You look like you might know a prayer or two by heart.
You've got a preacher's look about you.
What's your name?
Van Weyden. Humphrey Van Weyden.
Even sounds like a preacher's name.
I'm a writer.
What do you write about?
Whatever I see.
This the first time you ever saw a man die?
It's the first time I've ever seen such indifference to death.
Well, you haven't seen enough to be a good writer.
- This voyage ought to do you a lot of good.
- Voyage?
What do you mean?
That's the pilot boat, isn't it?
That's right.
Doesn't seem to be very far away.
It shouldn't take long to put back.
I'd pay you whatever you think your delay is worth to you.
Don't you intend putting me ashore?
No, Mr. Van Weyden, I don't.
You can't be serious about this.
Very serious.
My mate's dead. That leaves me one man short.
You're that man.
There's nothing I can do aboard a ship.
No, nothing much.
You're soft like a woman.
Woman. I'd almost forgotten.
What about her?
- Cooky?
- At your service. Coal will be up in a minute.
What about that woman we fished up?
Oh, she's in a bad way, sir.
Louie says he hardly expects her to live through the night.
It would be a shame for her to die.
She's so young and so beautiful.
A wench like that might very well liven up the tedious days of a long voyage.
You'll put me off at the first port of call.
I touch no ports, Mr. Van Weyden.
- We'll meet other ships sailing back.
- I hardly think so, Mr. Van Weyden.
The Ghost don't sail the regular ships' lanes.
You're stuck until we touch the port of Frisco again.
There's such a thing as the law.
I'm obeying the law, Mr. Van Weyden.
The law of the sea, which says anything you find in it is yours to keep.
I guess you can wash dishes and do scullion work.
That will release an able-bodied man for able-bodied work.
You're signed up as cabin boy, $20 a month.
What if I refuse?
Hey, cabin boy. Come here.
What's your name?
- George Leach.
- Sir.
Sir.
- Ever ship on a schooner before?
- No, sir.
Who signed you?
I wasn't interested in the man's name, sir.
- Did you get any advance money?
- I didn't have time to wait for it, sir.
You must have been in a hurry to get onboard.
What do the police have on you in Frisco?
That's a lie. Nobody's got nothing on me.
I can prove it.
Ha, ha. You ought to learn to control that temper of yours, Leach.
You give yourself away too easy.
You're not cabin boy anymore.
Our literary friend here is taking your job away.
You're promoted.
You're now boat-puller.
- Svenson.
- Aye, sir.
What do you know about navigation?
- Nothing, sir.
- Just as well.
You're first mate just the same. When you're through with that, get your stuff and go aft.
- Aye, sir.
- What are you standing around for?
I didn't sign up for boat-puller.
I signed for cabin boy.
I don't want no part of boat pulling.
It's a dirty, heartbreaking job.
You said you never sailed on a schooner before.
I once read about it in a book.
Pack up and go forward, you filthy scum.
Better do as he says, boy.
He isn't talking to a dog.
He's talking to a man.
So you're a man, huh?
I've spit in the eye of better men than you for saying less.
- You're disobeying orders, Leach.
- I don't like the way you give them.
You still feel like refusing, Mr. Van Weyden?
Get him to the galley.
Cooky will show what there is to do.
Cooky.
Ahoy! Pilot boat!
Ahoy!
- Svenson.
- Aye, sir.
- Through with that job?
- Aye, sir.
Call all hands aft.
We might as well have the funeral.
Aye, sir.
I only remember the last part of the service.
And, uh....
And the body shall be cast into the sea.
What are you standing around for?
Cast it in.
Heave.
"From 5 in the morning till 10 at night...
...I am forced to listen to his oily, insinuating tones.
To watch his greasy smile and to enjoy his monstrous self-conceit."
Is that me you're writing about?
If the descriptions fit you.
Keep a civil tongue.
You hadn't finish cleaning up that slop.
Well, strike me pink if this ain't gratitude for you.
Here you come, a poor, miserable specimen of human scum.
I take you into my galley,
I treat you handsome...
...and you write lies about me.
I have a good mind to bash your head in with a frying pan.
- You've got no right to read those things.
- Get out.
"But he is but one portrait in a gallery of rogues."
A well-turned phrase, I must say.
"The men onboard this ship, with the exception of a few...
...are all cast in the same mold as the master, Wolf Larsen...
...a brutal, callous and inhuman lot."
Oh, I'd hate to be in your shoes when Larsen reads this.
- You're not gonna show those to him.
- It's my duty as a loyal member of the crew.
"I keep thinking about the woman lying ill below deck."
You and me both, matey.
"And the tragic fate that seems to hang over her...
...that sends her from one evil to another."
Oh, so you've met her before, have you?
Whether I've met her is none of your concern.
Give me those.
It's my duty to turn them over to the proper authorities.
- Give me them.
- No.
You're not only a thief, you're an informer as well.
Informer and thief, is it?
There was a purse in those clothes you so graciously changed for me.
That purse is now empty.
- No one else but you could--
- You keep your mouth shut, you hear?
If you give me those notes.
The only thing you'll get from me is the back of my hand.
Once in Liverpool, the judge gave me two years for knifing a man.
Onboard this ship, it's not a criminal offense.
Six bells. The men will be eating soon.
Now, get back to your work.
You like being mate, don't you? Gives you a good feeling to be able to kick a man.
- Couple of hours ago, I beat Johnson up.
- I need my crew to work this ship...
...not to have them battered up below decks.
You told me to keep discipline.
I was afraid of trouble when we signed him on.
He was inciting a mutiny.
- What did he say?
- Oh, he asked too many questions.
- Does he know about my brother's ship?
- I don't think so.
None of you have been talking, have you?
And none of you better. So far as the crew is concerned, we're hunting seals.
- The longer they think so, the better for all us.
- I'm not sure of that.
We'll need them to fight for us if your brother's ship catches up to us.
Well, they'll fight or drown.
None of you bet--
Hey, Louie, do something.
- Captain's got another one of his headaches.
- No, it's all right.
It's going away.
You don't have to do anything. It's all right.
What questions did he ask?
Why we keep changing our course so many times...
...why we have a cannon aboard a sealing schooner.
Did you answer him?
Yeah, with a marlinespike on the side of his head, but not too hard.
Excuse me. Did you say you hit somebody with a marlinespike?
- Yeah.
- I'll go and put some stitches in his head.
Uh, sit down, Louie, and finish drinking your supper.
In the condition you're in now, you're liable to put your stitches in the wrong places.
- Oh, uh, how about your patient, Louie?
- Huh?
- Oh, my patient. She's improving.
- Mm.
Her condition was rather--
You take good care of her.
She's a friend of our literary cabin boy.
- A heavy fate hangs over her.
- It's possible. I was just--
And with you taking care of her, it's more than possible.
Louie has a perfect record onboard this ship.
He's never cured a patient yet.
- It's not my-- It's not my fault.
- Ha, ha.
The men, by the time they get to me, they're half-dead.
I'm a good doctor.
Hey, doctor. You're a faker. Ha, ha.
That's a lie. It's a dirty lie.
I was graduated from three universities.
From-- I was head of a clinic.
I've performed great operations.
I could perform them again if I had the instruments...
...if my hands didn't shake so much.
It's funny. I can't control my hands anymore.
You. You're a stranger.
You're an intelligent man.
You believe me, don't you?
- Sure. I believe you.
- Ah. See?
See? He believes me.
Somebody believes me.
Excuse me.
I will attend to my patient.
Cooky told me to clean up in here.
I thought I'd get through before the men finished eating.
I happened to find this lying open, and....
- Yeah, it's a great poem, isn't it?
- Yes, it's a great poem.
Read me some of it.
Here at least we shall be free
Here we may reign secure, and in my choice,
To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell.
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
That's a great line.
Milton really understood the devil.
Sit down.
This is the first time you've ever been in my cabin, isn't it?
Didn't expect to find anything like this, did you?
I really read them too.
Maybe it would have been better if I had never opened a book.
Cooky gave me your notes. I read them.
You don't have to be afraid.
I enjoyed them. You write very well.
Thank you.
"A brutal, callous and inhuman lot...
...cast in the same mold as their master,
Wolf Larsen."
And I wonder what you'll be like when this voyage is over.
- Do you think I'll change?
- Oh, yes, very much.
I don't think so, Larsen.
That's part of your education.
You must say "Captain Larsen" or "sir."
Remember, there's a difference in our social standing onboard this vessel.
What class of society do you belong to on land?
You don't have to answer.
It's written all over you.
Good education, breeding, refinement, sensitivity.
You got all the things that money can buy, including money.
Whatever money I have is earned from my books.
What?
You mean, you actually earn money?
How much?
- About 10,000 a year.
- Okay.
Well, you must be pretty good.
What kind of books do you write?
All sorts of fiction.
Oh, fiction. Nothing important.
No. Nothing very important.
Yes, but you wouldn't have to earn all that money.
If something would happen to you, like losing your arms or legs, or going blind...
...someone would take care of you, your friends, family.
They wouldn't be a brutal and inhuman lot, would they?
You wouldn't have to struggle for a living.
You wouldn't have to live in a world...
...where your hand was turned against every man's and every man's against yours...
...even your own brother's.
You seem to find it necessary to justify yourself, don't you, Captain Larsen?
My strength justifies me,
Mr. Van Weyden.
The fact that I can kill you or let you live as I choose.
The fact that I control the destinies of all onboard.
The fact that it's my will and my will alone that rules here.
That's justification enough.
- Where are you going?
- Cooky's expecting me in the galley.
Well, don't go. Let him wait.
It's a long time since I've talked like this with anyone.
Sit down.
What do you intend doing with these notes of yours?
Perhaps someday, I might write a book about my voyage on the Ghost.
You'll write about me, too, in this book of yours, won't you?
You'll be the leading character.
That's a good idea, a book about me.
I'll help you with it.
We'll spend lots of time together.
I'll tell you stories about my early life, stories that'll make them understand....
What difference does it make to me whether anybody understands or not?
Oh, yes.
I could tell you many things.
Of the bleak coast town where I was born, of my mother and father, peasants of the sea...
...who sold their sons upon the waves, got nothing in return but misery.
Five brothers I had.
Four of them are dead, drowned like rats in the fo'c'sles of rotten, leaking ships.
Oh, no. That's not for me.
I'll choose my death like I've chosen my life.
Cabin boy at 12, ship's boy at 14, ordinary seaman at 16...
...owner and master of my own vessel at 21.
All by myself, I did it.
I learned everything by myself: navigation, mathematics, science, literature.
All of this.
All of this I want written down, do you hear me? All of this.
- The first mate wants to see you below, sir.
- What's wrong?
The woman. I think she's dying.
What are you bothering me for?
Let Louie take care of it. He's the doctor.
Louie's in no condition to take care of anything, sir. He's too drunk.
Cooky.
I was trying to see if there was any life left in her, sir. I was holding her pulse, sir.
- What are you doing in here?
- The mate told me to stay with her.
That's the truth, sir. You can ask him, sir.
She's awful pretty.
- It's a shame she has to die.
- Shut up.
Did you try to wake him up?
Not much use. When Louie has a snootful like that, he's out for the whole day.
Leach, see if you can bring that drunken swine to.
She's breathing rather hard, sir.
- As though she were choking.
- Open a porthole, Cooky.
- We're in heavy sea, sir. We'll be drenched.
- Open it up.
- Well?
- I can't do anything with him, sir.
Every time I get him awake, he keeps dropping off again.
- Wake up, you drunken--
- He's awake, sir.
Make sure that he stays awake.
I got some hot coffee on the stove.
- I will get it.
- No. You stay here. I'll need you.
Leach, go to the galley and bring up that pot of coffee.
Be quick about it.
Two men, they're coming in here.
They'll ask questions.
You say you know me.
Yes. I'll say it.
I won't let them take me back.
I won't let them take me back.
You don't know what it's like being in prison.
I'd rather die.
- I'd rather die.
- Well, strike me pink. A convict.
A blooming, sniveling, snarling, no-good convict.
She's not a lady. She's one of us.
Have I said something that strikes you funny, sir? I'm glad, sir. I'm awfully glad.
Ah, you don't appreciate the humor of this,
Van Weyden.
Here this boat is loaded to the gallows with as varied an assortment of derelicts...
...and outcasts as ever sailed before the same mast...
...and what do we fish up out of the sea?
As Cooky puts it, another one of us.
Oh, I had a dream, a horrible dream.
Somebody kept on hitting me.
I begged them to stop, but they just kept on hit....
It was no dream.
What else could I do but sit here and get drunk?
I can't save her.
She's as good as gone.
- Listen to me.
- Let him have his drink.
- He's no good for anything else.
- We can't just let her die.
- There must be some last chance.
- Sure, sure.
- I could perform a blood transfusion.
- Well?
Onboard this boat, with the instruments that I've got...
...it's like asking me to perform a miracle.
All right, then. Perform one.
No. No, I can't.
My-- My hands are-- I need--
What he needs he'll never find again.
He's lost his nerve. Am I right, Louie?
Louie, listen to me.
You asked me before if I believed in you.
I said I did.
No. It might happen again.
If it did, I couldn't stand it. I'd kill myself.
This way, her life is not in my hands.
It's in the hands of fate.
I haven't anything to do with it.
You can't just perform a blood transfusion.
You've got to make sure that the blood itself is alike.
What?
Well, don't let that stop you, Louie.
- Leach.
- Yes, sir?
You'll give your blood for this woman, won't you?
- Certainly, sir.
- There you are.
Go ahead, Louie. You're lucky.
I'll guarantee you their blood is the same.
I get the point.
Don't you get it, Louie?
They both got the same blood.
He's a convict, she's a convict.
Get it? Jailbird's blood.
That's what the captain means.
Well, go on, Louie. Let's see you do it.
You even got yourself an assistant.
Cooky's done the first part of the job for you.
Medicine chest.
Better get that blood quickly before it cools off.
You don't have to worry, captain.
This kind of blood never cools off.
- Bringing about!
- Bringing about!
Let go of the jib sheet.
- Resting?
- I don't feel well, sir.
Well, maybe this will make you feel better.
Leave him be. Get to work.
- The kid's really sick, sir.
- Go forward.
Go below, I'll do his work for him.
I said he was to go forward.
What difference does it make?
As long as the work is done.
Leach, ever since you come onboard this ship...
...I've had to beat you at least once a day.
Don't you ever get tired of it?
Maybe sometime, you won't have to beat just him alone.
Look at this.
Stop laughing at me.
Stop laughing.
Haven't you seen a man dressed up before?
Careful of the step, my dear.
Your arm, my dear.
Captain Larsen, Miss Webster, my patient.
I'm glad to see that you're up and about, ma'am.
Thank you for everything.
I must have caused you a great deal of inconvenience.
Oh, no. On the contrary, I did nothing more than my Christian duty.
- I'd like to thank the sailor who gave his blood.
- Uh, yes. Yes. Uh-- Young man.
- The name is Leach.
- Excuse me. My memory.
Here he is.
I'm very grateful, young man.
When I reach shore, I shall see that you're well-rewarded.
Say thank you to the lady.
Thank you, lady.
Sorry that I couldn't turn back, put you ashore when you were picked up.
But you were so sick, it would be dangerous to move you.
That was my diagnosis.
Oh, I beg your pardon, doctor.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
The, uh, people you left behind.
- People?
- Mm-hm.
- What people?
- Oh, I mean your family.
They've probably given you up for dead by now.
I can imagine how happy they'll be to see you again when you get back to Frisco.
- Frisco?
- Mm-hm.
You're going back without touching any other port?
Oh, yes. This is a sealing schooner.
We make our catch and go home.
Oh.
- Anything wrong, Miss Webster?
- Nothing.
I just feel a little dizzy.
I guess I'm not as strong as I thought I was.
You've been out too long.
You shouldn't be out more than five minutes at a time. I'll take you back.
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.
Oh, Miss Webster, uh, your accommodations, are they satisfactory?
Yes. Thank you.
Quite.
- Cooky.
- Aye, sir?
I want you to do all you can to make Miss Webster feel at home.
Put some bars on her window.
So you couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you?
Maybe that will make you answer me.
You spoke about your past while you were unconscious.
- You were overheard.
- I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
You deliberately told them.
I swear, it's the truth.
All right.
I lied to you.
I put on an act.
Now, you had your laugh. You will give me a break, won't you, skipper?
What do you want me to do?
There must be boats passing on the way to China.
- You could put me aboard one of them.
- Lady, all this voyage...
- ...I've been trying to stay clear of boats.
- Or an island.
You could put me ashore on an island. I read someplace where the Pacific's full of them.
You know, someplace where boats pull in.
I can make my way from there.
Louie, take her below.
- You'd better come.
- No. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Listen.
You all look like pretty decent fellas.
Like you've been in spots like this before.
Give me a break, will you?
Will you?
You won't be sorry.
I promise you, you won't.
You're not on the Barbary Coast now.
You're onboard my vessel.
You behave yourself, or you'll spend the rest of the voyage locked below.
I didn't mean it that way. Honest, I didn't.
Don't hold it against me, please. Please.
Oh, give me a break, will you? Will you?
- Don't beg him, you hear me?
- Beg?
I'll crawl on my knees over every inch of this deck.
I'd do anything, anything not to have to go back.
- Do you know what it's like being in jail?
- Yeah, I know.
It ain't enough you knock her down.
You gotta kick her too.
Come on. I'll take you back to your cabin.
Oh, leave me alone, will you?
Leave me alone.
Look out!
Leach, according to the laws of the sea,
I could hang you for this.
But I won't.
You're gonna save me that trouble.
Before this voyage is over, you'll hang yourself.
Take him below.
You should have let me die.
He should have let me die.
Get back to work.
Van Weyden.
Come into my cabin.
I suppose I ought to thank you for saving my life.
It was instinctive.
You sound like you're sorry.
You don't have to work in the galley.
- There's a bunk in the officers' quarters.
- I prefer to stay with the men.
Well, suit yourself.
Only, I don't think they'll have you after today.
You see, their instincts are a little different than yours.
They wanted Leach to hit me on the head with that spike.
You're in a bad way, sort of in the middle.
But I suppose you're used to that.
Your sort usually is.
At least there's nothing on my conscience.
Ha, ha. You don't think there's anything on mine, do you?
Well, if that woman kills herself....
Kill herself?
Why should she kill herself?
There's a price that no one wants to pay for living.
How would you know?
You're an onlooker of life.
She talks about going to another country to start a new life.
But she knows well enough that that new life isn't gonna be different than the old.
She'll be on the streets of Shanghai like she was in Frisco.
And people will degrade her, but she won't kill herself, no.
She'll go on living until she decays.
Captain Larsen, a few weeks ago, you were interested in this book I intended writing.
You were very concerned with how I portrayed you to the world.
- Would you like to hear my description of you?
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
It isn't on paper yet, but I know every word of it.
I'll skip the physical description.
- That's obvious.
- Yes.
First impression one gets is that here's a man--
No, a brute.
Completely without feeling or thought.
A cruel, merciless creature who kills for the sake of killing...
...who tortures for the sake of hearing the anguished cries of his victims.
But as this first impression wears off...
...one realizes that this is a very highly complex individual.
A mass of contradictions.
A man who is tortured by a brain he should never have been given.
But with that brain, he is able to think.
To see clearly that all these things he denies in other men...
...the need for respect, for dignity, exist in himself.
Well, go ahead. You started. Finish.
The reason for his action then becomes obvious.
Since he has found it so difficult in the outside world...
...to maintain that dignity, he creates a world for himself.
A ship on which he alone can be master, on which he alone can rule.
The next step is a simple one.
An ego such as this must constantly be fed...
...must constantly be reassured of its supremacy.
So it feeds itself upon the degradation of people...
...who have never known anything but degradation.
It is cruel to people who have never known anything but cruelty.
But to dare to expose that ego in a world where it would meet its equal.
It's a lie.
It's a lie.
What do you want?
I....
I want you to forbid the men to laugh at me.
What?
Like....
Like Cooky.
When I first came on deck today, he thought it was funny...
...that I should be wearing these clothes.
But it isn't funny.
It's not funny at all.
When I had my practice,
I had 20 suits like this.
Each one of them more expensive than the other.
When I came into the hospital, everybody would greet me with respect.
I was a person of importance.
I'd like to feel that way again.
I don't want the men to call me Louie.
I want them to say "doctor."
Dr. Prescott.
After all, I did save this woman's life.
I did show a certain amount of skill.
And I haven't had a drink in a week.
Look, my hands.
They're steady as a rock.
Do you see what I'm trying to say?
After all, I haven't much more time to go.
I'm getting pretty old.
I know I'll never get back to private practice again.
I'll probably die a ship's doctor.
But whatever time I have left, I want to be treated with respect like I used to be.
- All right, Louie. I'll talk to the men.
- You're a great man, Captain Larsen.
- I'll never forget this. I'll never forget this.
- Come with me.
Excuse me.
Pipe all hands. Pipe.
Now, listen, everybody.
Louie's come to me with a complaint.
He's not being treated the way he feels he should be.
I don't want you laughing at him or at his clothes.
- Tell them about calling me Louie.
- Oh, yes.
He's not to be called Louie anymore.
From now on, it's "doctor."
- Doctor what?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Dr. Prescott. Dr. Louis J. Prescott.
- Yeah.
Dr. Prescott.
He's to be given all the courtesy and respect due a physician of his standing.
That satisfactory, Dr. Prescott?
Quite satisfactory, Captain Larsen.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Get away from me.
- Get away from me.
- Nice suit you got, Dr. Prescott.
Leave me alone.
Hey, go back.
Come on down here.
He's an old man. He's liable to lose his battles.
Let him come down.
Oh, no. Let him beg first.
By the time he comes off that mast, he'll be the old Louie again.
All right, that's enough. Leave him alone.
All right, Louie. You can come down.
Come down?
To what?
Hey you!
You can go on living, living like mangy curs!
But not Louie!
Not Dr. Prescott!
I've had my fill!
Come down, Louie!
You'll regret the day you ever tried to make a fool of Louie!
Hey, ask him why it is this ship doesn't sail the regular ship lanes!
Why she scurries like a rat at the sight of another boat!
- Come down!
- When I'm good and ready!
You won't answer any of these questions, will you, Larsen?
Well, I will!
This ship is a scavenger!
A scavenger!
And Larsen's the worst scavenger of them all!
A sealing vessel? Ha!
Yes, there'll be skins of seals onboard this boat!
But they'll be the skins he steals from other men!
From his brother! Yes, from his own brother!
Ha!
I know. Stealing doesn't mean anything to men like you.
But losing your lives does!
And that's the price he's gonna pay for those skins. Your lives!
There will be less of you come back from this voyage alive than went on it.
I can promise you that.
Hey, Larsen!
Tell him about your brother, Death Larsen!
Tell them about the fear that comes into your heart at the mention of his name.
I fear no man. No man!
Tell them about the oath he's taken to kill you.
Tell them about his ship, the Macedonia.
Tell them about the cannon he's got onboard it.
Primed to blow you, your boat, and all onboard to kingdom come!
Louie, come down!
I'll come down in my own way!
Hey, look.
There's a price no man will pay for living.
It was an accident. He slipped.
- What do you want?
- Mr. Johnson told me where you were.
What they done to you, how they beat you.
I came to see if I could help.
I don't need any help.
I can take care of myself.
I always have, I always will.
- Leave me alone.
- Thought you might like a cigarette.
- I said, leave me alone.
- Well, it wasn't my fault.
- Nobody asked you to play hero for me.
- Shut up.
Nobody's blaming you.
And don't get any ideas in your head either, why I went after Larsen.
He can't stand to see a dog beg, much less a human being.
Now, beat it.
I said, beat it.
I'm....
I'm sorry.
I had to let my hate out on somebody, and you happened to come along.
- Didn't you ever feel that way?
- You're hurt bad, aren't you?
Larsen does a good job.
Look, why don't you try and get some rest?
No, no.
I tried that. It don't work.
When I close my eyes, I see Larsen grinning at me, laughing at me.
I wake up trying to wipe that grin off his face.
When I keep my eyes open, my mind is clear.
I can think about what I'm gonna do.
Hold it, will you?
Listen. That's the kid.
Whenever he's sad, he plays that harmonica.
He makes up the songs.
He's good, ain't he?
I guess he's playing that one for Louie.
Louie.
I liked Louie.
He was decent.
Fat, old, drunken Louie.
He was so proud of them fancy clothes of his too.
Poor Louie.
Lucky Louie.
I don't think so.
Well, it's all over for him.
All the heartaches and the pains.
Supposing I said to you
I can get you off this boat.
It don't make any difference to me anymore.
You gotta fight. You can't quit.
- Tomorrow, I'll be on my feet. Tomorrow--
- Tomorrow will be like today.
And the day before.
He'll only beat you up again, and you know it.
What I got inside me,
Larsen can never get at.
- That's what drives him crazy.
- What? What is it?
I don't know.
I can't explain it.
It's something in me, and it tells me I gotta keep on fighting.
It tells me that there is something for people like us.
- Like us?
- Yeah. Like us.
Men like Larsen can't keep on grinding us down because we're nobodies.
That ain't true. We're somebodies. Look.
I-- I got a plan all worked out in my mind.
I'll get even with Larsen, and we'll get off this boat.
- We?
- Yeah, we.
You and I and anybody else who wants to go.
- We can all be free if it works.
- And if it don't work, you might be killed.
You said it before.
What have we got to lose?
You don't have to go back to the States.
There's an iron gate waiting there to shut me in too.
Oh....
Inside or out, it's all the same.
To be free.
To be let alone.
To live in peace.
Even if only for a little while.
Like this.
I don't expect that anymore.
Mr. Svenson was looking for you, sir.
Svenson? What did he want?
I don't know, sir. I saw him going down towards the fo'c'sle.
- Why are you standing the watch alone?
- Harrison isn't feeling very well, sir.
All right.
Svenson.
Aye, sir?
Uh, Johnson said you wanted to see me.
I didn't wanna see you.
- The attacks are getting worse, ain't they, sir?
- I didn't ask for your opinion.
- Now, where do you think you're going?
- I'm going for a walk on deck.
- I can't sleep.
- Oh, sensitive soul, ain't you?
Hey, careful on deck that the ghost of Louie...
...don't come jumping down at you from the main mast.
What do you want?
I wanted to talk to her.
- Leave her alone.
- She was crying.
- She was crying on deck too.
- There was nothing I could do.
There's nothing you can do now.
- What had to be done has been done.
- Leach...
...I wish you would believe me.
I'd like to help you.
We don't need your help.
- We?
- Yeah, we.
All we have to do to get off this boat is to flap our wings and fly away.
Yeah, we got wings.
Jailbirds' wings.
Good night, Van Weyden.
Good night, Leach.
Yes?
- Who is it?
- It's me.
You can stop your crying now.
It's over. It's done with.
Don't you understand me?
It's over. It's done with.
Steady. There's no time for that now.
I'll be all right.
Soon, we'll be off this hell ship.
- We'll forget we were ever onboard it.
- When?
- When?
- A few days, maybe a week.
It'll take time before Johnson and me can load that boat with supplies.
We got a long, tough trip ahead of us,
1500 miles on open boat.
But we'll make it, I tell you. We'll make it.
Yeah.
If I don't jinx you.
Don't say that, you hear me? Don't say that.
My arm. You're hurting me.
I didn't mean to grab you that tight.
You made me mad.
That's the arm where they...?
My blood.
Yeah.
Your blood.
I can't take any more chances. I gotta go.
Good night.
No more tears.
No more.
Stay on that wheel.
- How long have you been on deck?
- I've just come up.
- Did you see anybody come from the fo'c'sle?
- No, sir.
You're probably lying.
Come with me.
- Johnson.
- Yes, sir?
You saw what happened on this deck a while ago?
- I saw nothing, sir.
- Svenson and I were slugged...
- ...and thrown overboard.
- My eyes were on the course.
- Who did it, Johnson?
- I told you, sir. I know nothing.
Svenson's probably dead.
- I'll need a new mate. You can have his job.
- I wouldn't make a good mate, sir.
I don't know how to give orders.
I only know how to take them.
Come with me.
- You're not going down into the fo'c'sle?
- Yes.
- How will you know who did it?
- Don't worry, I'll know. Go ahead.
I've got Larsen.
All right, let him go, kid.
Now we're in for it.
You.
You put us up to it.
It was your idea to throw him overboard.
If you only handed me a knife, I had him.
I had him in my hands.
I would've put an end to him.
You weren't thinking of us when you gave us the idea.
You were thinking of you and that jailbird.
- Hey.
- Be a man, he says. Stand up for your rights.
Stand up for him he meant.
What difference does it make who our master is and what kind of ship we sail?
Get rid of Larsen.
There's a dozen that'll take his place.
Stop bellyaching.
You should've thought of that before.
Well, I didn't. I'm thinking of it now.
- I'll tell him who put us up to it.
- You don't have to tell him. I'll tell him myself.
And if I have to, I'll go out like Louie, thumbing my nose at him.
You've all forgotten about Louie, haven't you?
You're too busy worrying about what will happen to you.
Nothing will happen to you.
He needs you to sail a ship.
He needs you to break your backs for him.
Maybe someday, you'll get wise to that.
Van Weyden.
Van Weyden, are you down there?
- No, he isn't.
- Yes.
Yes, I'm here.
You better come up quick.
The old man wants you in his cabin.
If you so much as open your mouth....
I've seen and heard nothing.
Remember that.
Now you guys got something else to worry about.
I want the names of the men who were in on this.
You shall have them.
The leader, how the thing was worked out, and what they intended doing with the ship.
- You think you can get me all that?
- Have I ever failed you, sir?
Sterling character, isn't he?
That's his profession. Being a stool pigeon.
Cooking is only a hobby.
How you could've accused such a character of stealing your money--
Did he say that, sir?
Oh, the liar. The dirty, sniveling liar.
I dare you to repeat it to my face.
I said you were the only one who could have taken the money.
Lay a hand on me again, I'll kill you.
Do it now, Van Weyden. Go ahead.
Stick the knife into him.
Is this the first time you ever wanted to commit a murder?
Good feeling, isn't it, huh?
To know you hold a man's life in your hands.
You enjoyed it, didn't you?
I think I know now why men call you Wolf.
Yeah, you know a lot of things now you didn't know before.
You've changed. I told you, you would.
You're not the gentleman you were when you came onboard.
Oh, no. You've become more like the rest of them.
Like me.
A brutal, callous and inhuman creature.
I bet you think nothing now of turning that knife on me if I were to reach out.
You're mad, Larsen.
- Grab you by the throat.
- Stark-raving mad, you--
Larsen, what is it?
Oh, nothing.
I think it's just a headache.
I often get them.
They come and go.
This pressure on my brain...
...if it would only leave me.
It's driving me crazy.
Four bells.
It ought to be getting light soon.
Van Weyden, open the curtains.
You heard me? I said, open the curtains.
- Van Weyden.
- Yes?
Where are you going?
I wasn't going anyplace.
You were. I heard your footsteps.
Don't lie to me.
You know, Van Weyden?
You know.
- Yes, I know.
- Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.
If they find out I'm blind, they'll come up here and kill me. I won't have a chance.
It'll go away in a little while.
It always does.
And then I'll be able to see again.
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.
Pity, Van Weyden.
Pity.
Closer.
Come nearer to me.
That's it.
Pity, Van Weyden.
Pity.
You fool. You had your chance, but you lost it.
Now you'll have to stay here with me until my eyesight comes back again.
I was wrong.
You haven't changed.
You haven't changed a bit.
All right. Let's get it over with.
I have here in my pocket a list.
A list of the names of all of the men who were part of this plot to kill me.
I know exactly how it was started, who led it, and what you intend to doing with the ship.
An ingenious plan, a daring plan.
If it had succeeded, Mr. Leach.
You had other plans too, didn't you?
Something about, uh, escaping in a boat.
Do you know what I'm going to do with this list?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
I know exactly how you felt.
What Louie told you the other day was absolutely true, every word of it.
I have no intentions of hunting any seals.
I leave that to my brother.
Sure, my brother has cannon onboard.
Sure, he's got them primed to sink the Ghost.
Sure, there's a chance of all of you going down with the ship.
But also, there's just as good a chance that you won't.
And that means we'll get a cargo of seal skins the likes of which you've never seen before.
You see, that's the joke. We steal them from the same people who buy them.
Certainly, you have no scruples against stealing...
...if you get your share of the loot.
Louie didn't tell you that, did he?
And you will get your share.
If this voyage turns out well...
...you'll each have enough to keep you for the rest of your lives. I promise.
Van Weyden, open up the liquor stores for the men. Give them all they want.
Oh, yes.
There's one more thing
I feel I ought to warn you about.
You have an informer in your midst.
There's nothing I detest more than an informer.
As evidence of my good faith,
I'm gonna tell you who he is.
Cooky gave me this list.
- Cooky?
- Cooky?
Gee, damn it. You black-hearted devil!
Get that squealer.
Get him.
Let me go. Let me go.
Shark! Shark astern!
Get him over the railing now.
Better tie up what's left of his leg before he bleeds to death.
One sound and you're a dead man.
Keep your voice low.
The key to the supply closet, where is it?
- It's in the pocket of that coat.
- Get it, Johnson.
See if it fits.
It fits.
All right, get the stuff.
- You're escaping?
- No, we're inspecting the galley.
We wanna see how clean you keep it.
Take me with you.
If I stay onboard this ship any longer,
I'll go mad.
You won't stay on this ship much longer.
- You're going on a trip, a long one.
- Put that knife back.
- Take care of the stuff, I'll take care of him.
- Leave him alone.
We can't take the chance of him shooting his mouth off to Larsen.
- You can trust him.
- Aboard this ship, I wouldn't trust my mother.
What was that?
- Get in that closet.
- And be caught like a rat? Not me.
Come on. Get in there.
Van Weyden.
Who's down here with you?
No one.
No one's down here with me.
I thought I heard the sound of voices.
Must be the men in the fo'c'sle.
They're kind of noisy tonight.
Yes.
Yes, I guess you're right.
Must have been the men.
Did you see my mate?
I've been looking all over. He's probably drunk someplace like the rest of them.
Guess I'll have to take the wheel myself.
What's that noise?
What noise?
Didn't you hear the sound of a ship's siren off in the distance?
I didn't hear any siren.
You must be mistaken.
You sure you didn't?
That's funny.
All night long, I keep hearing the sound of a ship's siren coming closer and closer.
Guess I'll go up on deck.
Now. Now is the time for you to escape.
- Now? With him at the wheel?
- He won't see you.
- He won't see you.
- What are you talking about?
Don't ask me questions.
Go before it's too late.
- He can't see you, I tell you. He's blind.
- He's blind?
I was with him when he had one of these attacks before.
It takes several hours to go away. By that time, you'll be off the boat, you'll be safe.
Van Weyden, you could have given us away.
You didn't.
You're wasting time.
Johnson, get this stuff in the boat.
Do you still wanna go with us?
- Yes.
- I'll go get Ruth.
I can't help feeling he's staring right at us.
That he can see us.
He can't see, I tell you. He can't.
All ready. Come on.
- I'm not going.
- What?
No, I'm not going. You go without me.
I'm a jinx. Everything I ever touched, everything I ever done...
...always turned out wrong.
You'll never make it with me onboard.
- Something will happen.
- Are you getting in?
Oh, no. Go without me, will you?
Please, go without me.
How far have we gone?
We haven't gone very far yet.
We've only been sailing about six hours.
We still got quite a trip ahead of us.
But with a good wind and a little bit of luck, we'll make it.
I'll fix some grub.
She'll be up soon.
"Pleasant journey. Wolf Larsen."
He filled the water kegs with vinegar.
I guess there's no use trying the others.
We've still got the one we brought with us last night.
- Two gallons of water, 1500 miles to go.
- Shut up, son.
If we're careful, we'll make it.
Two gallons of water, 1500 miles to go.
- Four people.
- Four people.
I tell you, if we manage well, we'll make it.
And I tell you we will make it.
So you think you tricked us, don't you?
Sure, I can see you sitting on that deck laughing at us...
...but that laugh will choke in your throat, because we'll make it.
Water or no water, we'll make it.
Do you hear me, Larsen? We'll make it.
Captain Larsen, the number two dory, it's missing, sir.
- I know.
- Leach, Johnson, the girl, Van Weyden.
- I know that too.
- They couldn't have gone very far.
- We can still head them off.
- There's no hurry.
We'll pick them up in a few days.
It's a steamer. It looks like--
My brother's ship, the Macedonia.
He's caught up to me.
They'll soon catch up to us.
We might give them the slip if we make for that fog bank.
- Fog bank?
- Yes. There is one ahead of us.
Off the starboard bow, sir. Can't you see it?
Yes. Yes, the fog. I see it.
Make for the fog bank off the starboard bow.
Head straight into it.
- Tell him to keep steady as she goes.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Hold steady as she goes.
- They've sighted us, sir.
- No, they haven't.
They're just shooting blind.
We'll lose them in another minute.
I'm sorry, sir.
There's no place else for me to be.
I was afraid to be below deck.
We'd start to sink.
Shut up. We're not gonna sink.
I know. No, we're not, sir.
I know you'll pull us through, sir.
If that brain of yours has any schemes in it like giving away our position?
Oh, not me, sir.
I wouldn't do anything like that.
- Smoke.
- Aye, sir.
- Make sure that he doesn't.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Look out!
- That one got us, sir.
- Shall I order the boats lowered?
No.
No man leaves this ship until I give the word.
As long as we're afloat, we've still got a chance.
Get a man aloft!
Keep a sharp lookout!
He's blind.
He's blind.
He's blind, I tell you. The beggar's blind!
He's blind!
The beggar's blind!
No, not that way!
Wait a minute. Let me show you.
Take the tiller.
Try and keep her as she is.
I need you to mash that mud while I try and take a reef.
Ruth, no!
No!
Now, tie her to the mast with a rope.
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.
Swear you won't try anything like that again.
- Could you swear?
- No.
Ruth, Ruth.
- Listen to me.
- I don't wanna listen.
- If you three make it--
- Four. Either we all make it, or none of us do.
Johnson, Van Weyden.
They got something to look forward to.
You too. You can still make a new life for yourself someplace.
You. You, how about you?
All right, here it is.
We'll make land.
Maybe I'll get to Hong Kong or to Singapore.
I've been there before.
I know my way around.
All right, nobody will spot me.
I won't have to go back to jail.
How do you think I'll get along?
How do you think I'll live?
- Shut up.
- You asked me.
All right, now I tell you.
When we get to land, if we get there,
I'll make a living for you.
You'll stay with me.
We'll be married.
- What?
- I said, we'd be married.
We'll start from scratch, both of us.
There's a spot some place for us in the world, and we'll find it.
Johnson.
Johnson.
Johnson!
Van Weyden, Ruth.
A ship.
I see a ship.
Stop rowing, Leach.
The ship we're heading for is the Ghost.
Look.
The boats, they're all gone.
Where are you going?
Aboard the Ghost.
There's food and water on that ship.
- Enough to make it a sure thing for us.
- Oh, no. Don't.
There's nobody on that boat.
Can't you see, she's sinking?
- The boats are gone.
- But Larsen?
He probably saved his own skin first.
You stay here with Humphrey.
I'll lower the stuff down to you.
Open that door.
George.
George!
George!
George!
- Maybe we better go onboard.
- Yeah.
Leach!
Leach, where are you?
Here, I'm here.
Can you hear me?
Yes, I can hear you.
- Oh, then listen.
- This is no time for words now.
Listen to me. There isn't a chance of breaking this door down in time.
- Oh, we'll find a way.
- I got stuff piled out there, food and water.
I had it all ready when Larsen came behind me.
I didn't even have a chance to holler.
Get the stuff, put it on the dory.
- But what's gonna happen to you?
- Don't stand there wasting time.
Get off this ship before he gets you too.
Get off it.
The ship's sinking. You'll drown.
I'll drown. My number's up.
I knew it the minute I came onboard.
There's got to be a way to get you out of here. There's got to.
Sure. Larsen's got the key.
All you gotta do is ask him for it.
- All right. I'll get it.
- No.
Please, stay away from him.
He's not only blind, he's mad.
If you ever get near those hands of his, he'll tear you to pieces. You gotta live.
Not without you.
Van Weyden, make her go with you.
Stay here.
I'll get the key from Larsen.
Van Weyden. Van Weyden, come back.
Come back.
Do you hear me? Come back. Get off this boat.
Take her with you. Van Weyden!
Ruth. Ruth.
- You still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.
You shouldn't have stayed.
You shouldn't have stayed.
If you live, I live.
If you die, I die.
That's the way it is with me.
Funny how your saying that makes me think of one thing.
I once went to a wedding of a friend of mine.
The part that stuck in my mind most...
...was when they both repeated after the priest:
"For better or for worse, for richer or for poorer...
...in sickness or in health, to love and to cherish...
...till death do us part."
I guess we're gonna skip everything but the last part.
Oh, no. We've crowded all of our life together into one day.
I never even expected that much.
So if this is the way it's gotta end...
...it's all right with me.
With me too.
Come in, Mr. Van Weyden.
The door is open.
- I was expecting you.
- The key to the storeroom, I want it.
Come and take it from me.
If you take another step,
I'll blow your brains out.
That should prove to you that I can still see.
Not very much, vaguely, just shadows, but well enough to hit you between the eyes.
Where's Johnson?
Johnson's dead. He gave up his life.
Oh, I'm disappointed.
I thought it would be you who would make the noble sacrifice.
Why didn't you, Mr. Van Weyden?
- The ship's sinking. There's not much time.
- I've got all the time in the world.
Answer me. Why didn't you,
Mr. Van Weyden?
All your fine words were just fine words, weren't they? I was right all the time, wasn't I?
When you were faced with the choice, you let Johnson die.
I understand your actions.
I would have done the same.
Yes, but once you said to me, there's a price no man will pay for living.
What's your price?
You can come with us in the boat.
When we reach shore, I'll get you to a doctor.
He'll fix your eyes up for you, then you'll be able to see again.
No, thank you.
I'll never be able to see again.
I know that. I've known it for a long time.
This is the finish, for my eyes, for myself.
I sink with my ship.
That should appeal to you, Mr. Van Weyden.
It's in the best literary tradition of the sea.
I, Wolf Larsen, sink with my own ship in sight of land.
- Land?
- Yes, land.
- We're lying two miles off an island.
- I don't believe you.
It's beyond the fog bank. You'll see it when the fog lifts. Not much of an island.
A few Japanese fishing boats once in a while.
That's what I was heading for when my brother caught up with me.
It's the kind of an island that Leach and the girl dreamed about, isn't it?
Too bad Leach didn't know about it.
- Better go. She's settling fast.
- Go?
Yes, you can go. I won't stop you.
Take the girl with you.
I want you to finish writing that book about me.
The last chapter should be a good one.
Too bad you weren't onboard when it all happened. It was exciting.
The moment that my brother's boat sighted us, we made a run for it. I saw you move.
We slipped through this fog bank.
For a full hour, I bluffed the crew.
Nobody onboard knew I was blind.
And Cooky, Cooky found out.
"He's blind," he yelled.
"The beggar's blind."
He called me a beggar.
And my brother fired point-blank at us.
The Ghost began to sink.
They ran for the boats.
Like rats, they ran.
You'll write all of this in your book, won't you?
You better hurry.
Leach? What about Leach?
He goes down with me.
Why? Why?
He set the crew against me.
He once tried to kill me.
- And this is your revenge?
- Yes, yes, this is my revenge.
- I don't believe that's your real--
- I don't care.
He stays on the ship.
- He saw himself as a great figure.
- What are you talking about?
I'm reading you the last part of my book.
Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.
Yes.
Yes, that's it. That's what it all adds up to.
Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.
He saw himself to the last, proud, defiant, strong...
...shaking his fist at the heavens as the waters closed over his head.
He liked this death.
It was fitting he should die this way...
...dragging his enemies down with him, turning defeat into victory...
- ...the true death of the superman.
- Is that how it ends?
No, that's not how it ends.
There's one more paragraph.
As I stood there watching him,
I felt sorry for him.
I don't need anybody feeling sorry for me.
In a few minutes, he'd be alone, forced to face the truth.
I know what the truth is.
He'd see himself as he really was, a pathetic broken hulk of what was once a man.
Shut up.
Then he'd have to admit to himself that there was nothing heroic in his death.
It was mean and petty and cheap.
- The only motivation behind all of it was fear.
- Shut up, I say. Shut up.
He was afraid to go on living, for now he had no longer his great strength to sustain him.
Now he was helpless.
He had to go to other people and ask for help.
I remembered how he'd reacted when I told him he wouldn't expose that ego in another world.
- Now I knew that I was right.
- That's not true.
I don't wanna hear anymore.
Do you hear me?
So this was the end of Wolf Larsen.
The pitiful, dismal, pathetic finish.
I don't wanna hear anymore.
Do you hear me?
So now you can't even see shadows.
Van Weyden?
- Where are you?
- Here at the table.
Van Weyden.
I couldn't have missed you.
I saw you. I fired right at you.
It's hard to kill the truth, isn't it, Larsen?
- I could have escaped if I'd wanted to.
- If you wanted to?
Yes, after you fired and missed,
I could have run out of the room.
That's right. You could have.
A little while ago, you asked me what my price was.
Well, I'll tell you.
The key to that storeroom, Leach's life.
Van Weyden.
Van Weyden, answer me.
It's all right, Ruth.
Everything's going to be all right.
Stay at the door. Don't go away.
Well, what do you say, Larsen?
- I don't know what you're getting at.
- Simple.
I want to prove to you how wrong you were about everything, even about me.
I'll strike a bargain with you.
My life for Leach's.
I'll stay here and die with you,
Leach goes free.
- Are you trying to trick me?
- Door's locked, you still got bullets in that gun.
No, it's a trick.
Nobody does anything like that for anybody unless they get something out of it.
Maybe you think I'll unlock the door and let you go, is that it?
Maybe you think I'll give up my side of the bargain.
That you'll find some way that you won't have to go down with the ship and me.
I had it all figured out. I can't be wrong.
There must be a catch to it.
There's no catch, Larsen.
I'll go down with you in the Ghost.
Shove the key through the door and see.
Are you frightened I may prove you wrong?
- It's the key to the storeroom. Did you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Let him out quickly...
- ...before it's too late.
- But you, Van Weyden?
- What about you?
- I'll...
...meet you on deck.
Van Weyden.
Van Weyden, where are you?
Where are you, Van Weyden?
So it was a trick.
I did hit you.
I did hit you.
I knew there was a catch to it.
I knew it!
Van Weyden?
- Van Weyden.
- It's no use. It's too late.
Oh, no.
'September 9th, 1904,
'on board the Discovery, homeward bound from the Antarctic.
'I've added a little, I hope, to the knowledge gleaned
'by Captain Cook, Sir James Ross and other explorers before me.
'But I have only touched the fringe of things.
'I leave behind a whole continent,
'vast, mysterious, inhospitable,
'and still, to all intents and purposes, unknown.'
- Well, good night, Scott.
- Good night, sir.
I'm sorry, but that's how the land lies.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good luck to you.
- Sit up a little, Con.
- Hm?
- Sit up.
- Hm, sorry.
Something's gone wrong, hasn't it?
You can't go ahead.
Oh, we can go ahead, all right.
The Treasury won't let us have the money, that's all.
- Is that very bad?
- Yes.
It means I get the men but not the backing.
- I should have to make a public appeal.
- Well, why don't you?
You see, if I do go ahead with this show,
I might lose my chance in the Navy.
That would mean looking for some other job, and that would mean discomfort and unpleasantness for you.
As far as I'm concerned,
I'd take it on any day.
As far as we're concerned, Con, any day.
You knew the Antarctic long before you knew me.
I always knew you'd go back.
And I'm not the least jealous.
As a matter of fact, I don't think
I'd love you so much if you didn't.
Don't move, Con.
Do you remember walking along the sands just after the tide had gone out?
I asked you what exploration really meant to you.
The sands were still wet, and you said, "The fascination of making the first footmarks."
I'm a very, very lucky man.
Now, what shall it be?
"I appeal with confidence" or "I confidently appeal"?
"It is with confidence that we appeal..."
Lunch!
Lunch is ready, dear.
Just in time, Oriana.
- What is it?
- A flea, a rare one.
Just hold him while I get some spirit to preserve him.
No ordinary flea, Oriana.
I'll send him to Rothschild for his collection.
You might as well send him my soufflé too.
- Is that done now?
- Yes, quite done.
Never mind.
Oh, how's the drawing going?
Natterer's Bat. Lovely name.
Oh, isn't it heavenly here?
All on our own.
- Except for dead bats.
- And very dead grouse.
I wish they wouldn't keep sending them to you on your holiday.
I'll go and see.
Natterer's Bat.
Did you hear me, Mrs Wilson?
I suppose you couldn't help it.
I came here by motor car.
I've left it exhausted alongside the gate.
- How far have you come?
- The last lap was nearly a mile.
- Bill about?
- Yes. Do you want him?
Er, yes, I do rather.
- Well, he's working, you know.
- Yes, I know.
- He's...
- Working.
Come along.
- That noise was Captain Scott.
- Hello, Con.
- Hello, Bill.
- Haven't seen you lately.
You forget, Captain Scott's been on his honeymoon.
Well, as a matter of fact,
I've been rather busy, but we hope to have a honeymoon someday, somewhere.
Well, Con?
What's up?
Shackleton hasn't done it, Bill.
He nearly did but not quite.
I'm going back.
Shall we go in?
- Mind if I kick it up a bit?
- No, carry on. They're your boots.
How far did Shackleton get?
He got to within 90 miles of the Pole.
- Isn't 90 miles near enough?
- No.
Because it isn't it.
It's not the South Pole.
That's still there, waiting.
And, er, I think an Englishman should get there first.
Well, Bill? What do you say?
There's my work for the Grouse Commission.
That's no obstacle.
We shan't be leaving for at least a year.
I think my exploring days are over.
I don't want to get somewhere first just for the sake of doing it.
Now, if it had been a rather different proposition, if the idea was to go back and carry on all the jobs we started on the Discovery expedition...
But that is the idea, Bill. That's it.
We'll do better.
We'll work on the Barrier, on the mountains, right up to the Pole.
Ours will be the best equipped expedition.
Dozens of scientists under that most eminent of all scientists: Dr Wilson.
Yes, that is different!
Come with me, Bill.
I couldn't let him go without me, could I, Oriana?
No.
Thank you.
Well, I wonder if the motor will start.
Yes, I wonder. You can't possibly go without having something to eat.
No, of course not.
That's the fly you caught the two-pounder on, in the burn at Clachen.
- Remember?
- Yes.
It's a long time ago now.
Look, the gut's all perished.
So it is.
Oh, darling!
Darling!
- Morning, Teddy.
- Oh, good morning, sir.
What have you got there?
Well, it's a... It's a sort of cash chart.
That's the target, there's the date, sir, and the contributions coming in.
Hm. Long way to go yet.
Anything in the post?
Not much money but plenty of people.
"Dear and honoured sir,
"if I could be allowed to join your expedition
"I would even become a British subject."
Here's one from a Bluecoat boy. He says,
"It's frightfully cold in my dormitory so I'm sure I should be all right."
Let him down lightly. Anything else?
No big cheque, I'm afraid.
Oh, some details about your lecture tour, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
There's a young lady here about a dog.
A dog?
Oh, show her in, Caroline.
Name, please, Miss?
Helen Field.
- Chair, Teddy.
- Yes, sir.
Please sit down, Miss Field.
Thank you.
I've brought you the money for a sledge dog.
You said we might.
Anyone, I mean. In your appeal.
How very kind of you, Miss Field.
- My name is Scott.
- Yes, I know that.
And this is Lieutenant Evans, my second in command.
I didn't know that.
How are you? I hope you're well.
- How are you, Teddy?
- Oh, very well, thank you, indeed.
Look, here's the envelope with the money from the school.
And...
You know, Miss Field, when business firms send us cheques, we're pleased enough, but somehow this means more.
Please thank them tremendously.
- Tell me, how many are there?
- 300, nearly.
Well, please thank them all.
We intend to call the dogs by the names of any schools that give them.
Rugby, Fettes, that sort of thing.
What's the name of your school?
South Hampstead High School for Girls.
Yes. I think we'd better just call him Hampstead.
Thank you for having turned out on such a dirty night to hear this talk.
During the past few days
I have had the pleasure, or rather, I should say, the great pleasure of addressing meetings like this all over the country.
And knowing, as I do, the rivalry that exists among our towns and cities
I am hoping that, as the result of this rivalry,
I shall be able to report to my committee in London that your city has gone one, if not a great deal, better than your fellow cities.
Um, thank you.
Well, I'm sure we're all very grateful to Captain Scott for coming and giving us this illuminating account of the Antarctic and I'm sure that if anyone wants to ask any questions
Captain Scott will be only too pleased to answer them.
Mr Chairman, I'm not averse to subscribing to anything that might be in the national interest, but it does occur to me to ask, why must this country send another expedition?
What about the Norwegians?
What about Nansen?
Nansen has given up polar exploration.
He's getting on, you know.
What about that other fellow?
Amundsen? He's making for the North Pole, not the South.
What's the difference?
What's the prospect of trade between this city and the South Pole?
Is there any coal down there, anything I can buy or sell?
I'm sorry we didn't raise more for you, but I suppose every penny counts.
Better luck somewhere else.
Are you sure I can't give you a lift?
It's not far out of my way.
No, please don't bother.
Well, then, I'll just wish you a good night and good luck.
Thank you. Good night.
Captain Scott?
Yes?
Glad I've caught you.
I've come from India.
Want to join your show, if you'll have me.
Good with horses.
Do you mean to tell me you've come 6,000 miles
- to join my expedition?
- Yes. Landed this morning.
- Who are you?
- My name's Oates.
- I'm with the Inniskillings.
- Hm.
No sense in getting soaked, is there?
That's better.
- Cavalryman, eh?
- Yes, sir, dragoons.
- Know anything about the Antarctic?
- Only what I've read.
When I saw you were taking ponies,
I thought perhaps I'd come in handy.
- Fit?
- As a fiddle.
- Age?
- Married?
- No.
- It will be tough.
- I know.
- As Hades.
- But not so warm, eh?
But I think we can manage it.
- We?
- That's what I said.
- Do you mean you'll take me?
- Glad to.
- You're on the strength.
- I say.
- Here's a tram. Come on.
- I say, just a moment.
This any good?
- This is for £1,000.
- Yes. Any good?
'Instead of sitting waiting for the money to come in,
'I'm taking the opportunity of trying out my motor sledges.'
You see the idea, Dr Nansen?
The wheels make their own road as it goes along.
- What do you think of it?
- Yes, what do you think?
I'm afraid Dr Nansen doesn't like motors, dear.
That is so.
I like dogs.
I can't help feeling that we should use every modern invention that comes along.
Somebody's got to try these things out.
I even thought of taking a wireless telegraph apparatus, but it's too heavy.
You are right, Captain, but I like dogs.
Yes, yes, that's what Amundsen says too.
I've been hearing about his plans for the North Pole.
Amundsen's a pupil of mine, as you might say, so of course he believes in dogs.
Well, perhaps I'm prejudiced, but I should hate to repeat the experience I had on the Discovery expedition.
You see, we look on dogs rather differently, more as... well, more as friends.
Captain, a friend in need is a friend indeed.
This Antarctic of yours is a cold and cruel place.
Even worse than the North.
A dog is an animal.
When a dog is finished, he is still some use to other dogs, and even to man if need be.
That machine of yours, when it is finished, it's just a heap of metal in the snow.
You cannot eat it.
That's true, and I am not forgetting the lessons of the past, but I want to take the new things as well.
I shall take dogs, ponies and motors.
Well, I would take dogs, dogs and dogs.
Hello, Bill. Morning, Cherry.
- Morning.
- Good to see you.
- How's Kathleen?
- Splendid. Come along in.
- Morning, Atch.
- And the baby?
Peter? Wonderful, bald as a coot.
Morning, sir.
I'd know that mug anywhere.
Come out of it, Taff Evans.
I was rather surprised you didn't apply to come with me again this time, Evans.
Didn't have to, sir.
I knew you'd send for me sooner or later.
My release is through at last.
I'm afraid there's no hurry, Bill.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Teddy.
Have a look at that.
At the rate the money's coming in, you could go on carving up grouse till Christmas.
Rather depressing. Time's getting on.
And none of us are getting any younger. not to make any more appointments.
He turned up from the Persian Gulf this morning, sir.
I couldn't say you wouldn't see him.
Indian Marine Lieutenant.
Doesn't say how old he is.
26, sir.
Today as a matter of fact.
- May I come in, sir?
- Well, you are in, aren't you?
There's more to come, sir, with permission.
- The door was open, sir.
- True.
I heard my name and I think I did mention my age, sir.
There, sir, 26.
Is that real or something you stuffed inside your coat?
Quite real, sir.
Hm. Bill, how's this?
Well, I'd rather he hit Teddy than me.
- May he hit Teddy?
- Mm, I don't see why not.
Excuse me, sir, but I'm a good deal senior to Bowers.
Pity.
- Sit down, Bowers.
- Thank you, sir.
Why do you want to join this show?
I suppose you want to be among the first to reach the Pole. Is that it?
- Out for a bit of white ribbon, eh?
- No, sir.
I know it sounds stupid to say I want adventure, but, er...
What do you mean by adventure?
Well, sir, to get some extra knowledge of the stars and land and weather and...
And?
Other men's jobs.
Well, Bowers, to date we've had 6,042 applications.
I'm afraid I've made up my mind we can't take anybody else.
Hello? Oh, good morning, Sir Clements.
What?
The grant is through.
How much?
I see. Yes, yes, of course.
Well, thank you very much for letting us know at once.
Yes. Goodbye, sir.
- How much?
- A lot short of what we wanted.
- Yes, but it makes it just possible.
We shall have to cut down a bit, that's all.
- How about my side of things?
- Don't worry.
I won't cut a penny on your side.
I promised you the greatest scientific expedition that ever left England.
- How on earth will we do it?
- One ship instead of two. There she is.
We can go, Bill. We're going.
What do you want?
Oh, yes, I was just going to kick you out, wasn't I?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll take you. How's that?
- Thank you, sir.
- Right.
- Oh, Bowers.
- Yes, sir?
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you very much, sir.
'The first leg of our journey, halfway round the world.'
Cherry.
Just a minute, son. Just a minute.
Excuse me, sir.
Oi, Jehu, stop it!
Could you tell me where Captain Scott is, please?
That's right, sonny. You come to Uncle.
He's a Russian, he don't understand.
Ah, this is for the owner. Up there.
Not on the bridge, on the poop deck.
Telegram, Captain Scott.
Oh? Oh, thank you.
Thanks.
- Any message for Peter?
- Tell him I'll bring him a penguin.
Excuse me.
Good bye.
God bless and keep you, my dearest, until...
All visitors ashore! Come along, please!
Think of me when you make those footmarks.
Every step of the way.
Up gangway!
Hold on!
All right, carry on.
This is a bit thick, thousands of miles from the nearest bookie.
- What's up?
- Red-hot tip for the National.
- Is that a race?
- A race? Why...
Hook, line and sinker!
- Hard luck, Titus.
- Thank you.
The Grouse Commission are thinking of us.
- Splendid.
- They don't say what, of course.
Here's a good one, sir.
"Love to Hampstead and kind regards to the rest of you,
"Helen Fields."
Oh, wait a minute.
I've got another one here somewhere.
"I'm going south, Amundsen."
- South?
- But I thought it was understood.
- Everyone thought it was understood.
- I can't believe it.
It's perfectly true. Read it yourself.
From Madeira. That means he's started.
- Why didn't he tell anyone?
- Not very sporting.
He's changed his mind.
Anyone's allowed to change his mind.
He was going north, now he's going south.
That's all.
It means a lot to you, doesn't it, getting there first?
Of course it does.
You know damn well it does.
The Antarctic's a big enough thing to be up against without this fellow butting in.
Why has he suddenly changed his mind?
He's trying to make a race of it and we're not rigged for racing.
Quite, Con, quite.
What on earth would you do with all us scientists?
We'd be falling over each other.
You're right, Bill. You're right.
This is a scientific expedition.
I am not going to be stampeded and I am not going to take any risks.
In fact, I'm not going to race.
I wonder what route the blighter's taking.
'Wonderful to be free at last from problems so difficult to handle.
'Whatever lies ahead,
I am now on my own ground.'
There you are, sir. The Great Ice Barrier.
400 miles long and 100 foot high.
'This is obviously the best place,
'a sloping shore and a good stretch of bay ice.'
Steady, keep her straight on the lines.
Mush! Mush!
'With ponies, motor sledges, dogs and men parties,
'we've done an excellent job of transporting.
'Bowers proves a perfect treasure.
'There's not a single case he doesn't know
'or a single article which he cannot find at once.
'So, we are landed and the hut is up eight days after our arrival.
'A very good record.'
Sir.
- What is it, McKenzie?
- Beg pardon, sir.
We were wondering if you'd take old puss with you to the Pole, sir.
- Sure to show up well against the snow.
- Yes, sir.
Hear, hear, sir.
He'd show up well anywhere.
No, no, it's very good of you fellows to suggest it, but I mustn't take the luck from the ship.
- Great minds think alike, eh?
- Yes, sir.
- Goodbye, Pennell.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Best of luck to you all.
- And to you.
Thanks. See you in about... well, a year's time.
Yes, sir.
'The ship will drop Campbell's party up the coast
'on her way back to New Zealand.
'What news shall we have for her when she returns next summer, I wonder.
'There is much for us all to do while the daylight lasts.
'When the sun does go, we shan't see him for half a year.'
Oi, oi, oi!
Hello.
Oi, don't go away.
Come back. There's nothing to worry about.
Well, the winter's almost on us now, and that means sitting tight here for the next six months.
Seems a good moment to run over what's ahead when the sun comes back.
This chart makes things pretty easy to understand, I think.
- Can you see all right at the back?
- Yes, thank you, sir.
We're here, just above the sea ice.
The first stage is the Great Ice Barrier.
About 400 miles to cross.
Then come mountains 9,000 feet high.
We get up them by the Beardmore Glacier.
There's over 100 miles of that.
Lastly, the plateau.
Another 350 miles along that to the Pole.
Now, about ways and means.
The secret of travel in the Antarctic is food and fuel.
Hot food will take a man further than cold food.
And remember, there's no such thing as living off the country.
Every ounce will have to be carried and depot'd all the way along the route to supply us on the way home.
Give me a hand with the other one, Bill, will you?
Now, you see these depots marked here?
Up to the last, One Ton.
These are the ones we put down this summer in order to save weight next summer.
Beyond, on the outward journey, the southern party will put down more depots every so often.
The whole resources of the entire party will be devoted to getting four men into a position from which they can make their final bid for the Pole.
Outward to the foot of the glacier, tractors, ponies and dogs will haul as much as they can as far as they can.
From then on, we'll ask no more of machines and animals.
It'll be up to us.
From the glacier to the Pole and all the way back, man-hauling.
Now, the time margin is very small.
We've found already that our ponies can't stand the lowest temperatures.
So it will mean starting later than I'd hoped.
And we shall have to move faster than Shackleton did to have any chance of reaching the Pole and getting back.
Getting back, mark you, before the darkness and winter blizzards set in again.
Now, is that all clear? Any questions?
- I know one I'd like to ask him.
- Which four, eh?
It's the ship. She's back.
- What's the trouble, Pennell?
- Came across Amundsen.
- Where?
- Bay of Whales.
The Bay of Whales, eh?
400 miles away.
That's practically next door out here.
- How many men has he got with him?
- Only 19 all told, sir.
He has more than 100 dogs.
Never seen so many dogs.
He's got some cheek.
We found this place first.
Fellow has a million miles of ice to choose from and he has to pick ours.
Ah, well, the Antarctic's big enough.
Right, Pennell. Thanks for the news.
Now, you'd better get out again before the sea freezes over.
I shall be glad when we've finished with the Pole and we can get down to some real work, won't you, Bill?
- Hot char anywhere?
- Oh, shut that door, Birdie!
- Giving tongue all right, aren't they?
- Mm.
Well, good night, all.
Good night, Ponko.
Brrrr!
Good night, Uncle Bill.
Good night, Atch.

The Sleeping Bag, a poem.
Hurray!
On the outside grows the fur side
On the inside grows the skin side
So the fur side is the outside and the skin side is the inside
One side likes the skin side inside and the fur side on the outside
Others like the skin side outside and the fur side on the inside
If you turn the skin side outside, thinking you will side with that side
Then the soft side, fur side's inside, which, some argue, is the wrong side
If you turn the fur side outside as you say it grows on that side
Then your outside's next to the skin side which for comfort's not the right side
For the skin side is the cold side and your outside's not your warm side
And two cold sides side by side are not right sides, one side decides
If you decide to side with that side, turn the top side fur side inside
Then the cold side, hard side, skin side is beyond all question inside out
Well done that man! Well done that man!
Well done, Bowers!

Christopher, you're a toad.
Well, you're in good form, Soldier.
How about these fellows?
Not too dusty, considering.
Will they get us across the Barrier in the spring?
Can't say yet.
There's one or two
I'm a bit worried about.
Nobby's all right.
And so is James Pigg.
Old Jehu, I'm not so sure.
This fellow Amundsen, can he do it, do you think, just with dogs?
Can't say, Soldier, can't say.
These Norwegians are better with dogs than we are and... our using these chaps means making a later start.
His base is 80 miles nearer the Pole, but he'll be crossing unknown country.
Seems to me it all depends on whether he finds another way up to the plateau.
It's just a matter of luck.
But they're tough people, Soldier.
No doubt about that.
'It's glorious to stand bathed in brilliant sunshine once more.
'The future is in the lap of the gods.
'I can think of nothing left undone to deserve success.'
- Come along, Crean.
- Just a minute, sir.
Hurry up, Ponko.
- Hurry up, Teddy.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Right, Lashly. Let's have another go.
Right-oh, Teddy.
Good luck. Right-oh, Day.
Come on, the Baltic Fleet.
'The slowest ponies first
'with Atkinson, Wright, Keohane.'
Birdie!
'Bowers, Crean, Cherry-Garrard.
'Evans with Snatcher.
'Evans is a tower of strength, as sound and as hard as ever.
'Wilson with Nobby.
'Oates with Christopher,
'the biggest handful of the lot.
'And myself with Snippetts.'
Good luck!
'16 men all told.
'Four days out, all ponies going well.'
Mush! Mush!
Mush! Mush!
'There's nothing like Antarctic air for sharpening the appetite.
'We're always ready for our mug of pemmican hoosh,
'followed by tea or cocoa.'
Here you are, Stareek.
Hampstead!
"Just a heap of metal in the snow."
There's still the other one.
I hope so, Bill. I certainly hope so.
I'm afraid that's it, sir.
Well, we'll just have to man-haul our load till the others catch us up.
'Both motors have fallen out.
'Now all depends on the ponies.'
Whoa, back!
Whoa, Christopher! Whoa, back!
'We've taken to marching by the midnight sun,
'so that the ponies get rested at the warmest time of the day.'
Sir, I've been totting up on the hay we have aboard.
Is none of them ponies coming back?
Afraid not, Crean.
Soon meat, Stareek.
Much meat.
Fresh meat.
'We are now more than halfway to the glacier,
'but it's still rather touch and go with the ponies.'
There it is.
Hey, Teddy!
Teddy!
Sir.
Congratulations.
150 miles since the motors let you down.
- Well done, the lot of you.
- Thank you.
Will they manage it, Soldier?
Shall we get them as far as the glacier?
Old Jehu's about done, I'm afraid.
Still, he's paid his way.
It's strange, but when I write to Oriana,
I can see so clearly the place the letter's going to.
I mean, where she is.
But her face itself is always misty.
Yes.
Yes, I know what you mean.
When I try to see Kathleen there's always some feature
I can't quite get.
Very odd that. I feel just the same about an old horse of mine.
I can see the paddock all right, but can't get the old chap's muzzle.
Well, this is as far as we go together.
- Thank you, Day. Thank you, Hooper.
- Thank you, sir.
- Goodbye.
- Good luck, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't forget the letters, Day.
- No, sir.
- Ready?
- Right.
- Goodbye, you fellows.
- Goodbye.
Jehu.
Atch.
'The blizzard has lost us five days already
'and we are now well behind Shackleton's time.
'We must get the ponies on a little further.'
We can't be far from the glacier now, but wherever we are, this is the finish.
Crean.
Birdie!
Now, Christopher, old man.
Look!
Well, they did it.
I congratulate you, Titus.
And I thank you, Titus.
The glacier tomorrow, Bill.
- Dimitri?
- Sir?
Here's the mail.
Goodbye and good luck.
Goodbye, sir.
Good luck.
- Goodbye, Dimitri.
- Goodbye, Ruski.
- Good luck, boy.
- Dos vedanya!
Mush! Mush!
Well, goodbye, Meares.
Have a good run home.
Thank you, sir, and the best of luck to you.
Thanks.
Mush!
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Mother Meares.
'12 men with three sledges, man-hauling.'
Brandy, Uncle Bill? What's this for?
The use of that, my dear Titus, is purely medicinal.
Kindly hand it to me.
'We've climbed 4,000 feet.
'We've been toiling for five days but are barely halfway up.
'Surely we were right not to bring the dogs on.'
Halt.
That way.
Aye, aye, sir.
Ready? Heave.
Ready?
Heave.
Birdie?
Better leave a flag here.
Seems to be a good way up.
Aye, aye, sir.
See that nunatak?
That's what Shackleton called
Buckley Island.
Top of the glacier, sir?
Yes, that's right. Our last big climb.
At this rate, sir, we should be at the top in time for our Christmas dinner.
That's right, Lashly.
Merry Christmas is the word.
Take the strain, Crean.
Toss him a line, Birdie.
- You all right, Lashly?
- Yes, sir.
Sure to be. It's my birthday too.
Many happy returns, Lashly.
Right, Birdie.
Right, Crean. Bowline.
Heave.
Bowline.
Taff, caramel?
Thank you, sir.
- Con?
- Thank you, Bill.
- Atch?
- Thank you, Uncle Bill.
Soldier, you're a marvel.
Well, Christmas comes but once a year.
Christmas comes and Atch goes, eh?
Yes, worst luck.
Thank you.
Pemmican and pony?
How do you do it, Titus?
Perfectly simple.
Been giving you short rations all week.
Oh!
- Well, it was worth it.
- Thank you, sir.
Atch.
Yes?
What do you have to have to be given brandy?
Leprosy.
Plague.
Or just an ordinary fit.
- Fit, eh?
- Hm.
- Er, more, sir?
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, sorry, sir.
- That's all right, Atch.
We are a bit crowded in here tonight.
We ought to eat by numbers.
- Don't put too much faith in numbers.
- Carry on, Evans.
- Story coming.
- Well, hardly a story exactly, sir.
But I remember when we was at Whale Island, we had a PO gunnery instructor.
He was on one of them guns with the new-fangled breech action.
Good, but tricky.
You had to press the button near the breech with your left thumb and then whang in the block with your right hand.
Trouble was, some on the course gets so excited, they gets the movements too close together.
In goes the block and off comes the top of their thumb.
This PO gets tired of seeing a lot of people wandering about with no tops to their thumbs and he calls the class together and he says, "Now, listen, you flat-footed soldiers.
"Let's have no more of this.
"I'll demonstrate the drill to you slowly, by numbers.
"One, I opens the breech.
"Two, I presses the button with my left thumb.
"And three, I sends home the block with my right hand.
"And that's how you lose the top of your bloody thumb."
Keep back! Keep back!
Oh! Brandy!
Brandy! Brandy!
- That's out of date, Titus.
- Brandy.
This is the modern treatment.
No, Uncle Bill! Uncle Bill, stop it!
No, stop it!
No!
'9,000 feet up,
'the Barrier and the glacier behind us.
'It should be level-going now, all the way to our goal.'
- Goodbye, Atch.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Look out for us in March.
- Right.
With any luck, we'll be back before the ship has to go.
- I hope I haven't disappointed you.
- No, no, Cherry.
It was a sheer toss-up whether you or Titus went on from here.
- Was it really?
- Mm.
- Who's going to go on the last lap?
- I don't suppose it's settled yet.
Four out of the eight of us.
We're all hoping.
Ready?
Heave.
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Ted.
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, you fellows.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Atch.
'Eight men with two sledges, man-hauling.'
- This wind!
- Help us on the way back, though.
Hardest decision of the lot, Bill.
And the one where you can't help me.
Can we depot our skis here, sir?
Help lighten our sledge.
Yes, all right.
Leave your lot here.
The return party can pick them up.
Whoever they are.
We'll make our lunch camp here, let you get ahead a bit.
'Is my team the best?
'Is it?
'Are we all at our best?
'Bill and I? Yes, all right, that's two.
'And Taff Evans, of course.
'Soldier? Soldier too, then. All right.
'Our four.
'Our four.
'What about Teddy's?'
Halt.
Carry on, Bill.
Ready?
Heave.
'The best four men.
'The best... Who are the best four?
Teddy?
'Birdie?
'Lashly?
'Crean?'
Last letters home go tomorrow.
You're too big, both of you.
What the Captain wants is a middler, about 5' 8".
- And what might you be?
Oh!
Here comes the Captain.
Well done, lads. First-class job.
Lashly, Crean.
It's only fair to tell you now that you'll not be coming on with us.
I'm very sorry indeed.
You've done splendidly and I shall never forget it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
And me, sir?
- You'll be coming on.
- Thank you, sir.
Good for you, Taff.
You're a lucky devil, Taff.
You always were.
Teddy?
Yes, sir?
About tomorrow.
I've given a lot of thought to the matter, and I've decided that my four should go on.
I see, sir.
There's one other thing.
I want to take Bowers.
If you can spare him.
- Five, sir?
- Yes.
Right.
And, Teddy?
Sorry.
Thank you, sir.
I'm taking five, Bill.
- Five?
- Yes, you, me, Bowers, Oates and Taff Evans as the strongest and biggest.
A scientist, two sailors and a soldier.
What better companions could a man have, eh?
'Dear Kathleen,
'a last note from a hopeful position.
'I think it's going to be all right.'
- Goodbye, Crean.
- Goodbye, Lashly. Best of luck.
- Goodbye, Lashly.
- Goodbye, sir.
Well, Teddy, we couldn't have got this far without you.
Thank you, sir, and good luck.
Thanks. See you sometime in March, eh?
Ready?
Heave.
Let's give them a cheer, lads.
- Hurray!
- Hurray!
'Five men with one sledge,
'man-hauling.
'This surface is horrible.
'Crystals like sand.

- No, not yet.
Latitude 88:25, sir.
- Farthest south, eh?
- Good-oh.
- Beyond Shackleton at last.
- That's great, sir.
Something the matter with your hand?
Only a cut, sir. It's nothing.
I heals easy.
At least, I do at home.
'Cooking for five takes a seriously longer time than cooking for four.
'It's an item I had not considered when reorganising.'
'Can we keep up these marches?
'It's a critical time.
'But we ought to do the trick.'
How far now, sir?
About 27 miles, two good marches.
I'm sorry but my sleeping bag is not on the sledge.
Halt.
It can't have fallen further back than our last halt.
May I go, sir?
I'm coming with you.
Can't trust myself to speak, sir.
Well, don't, then, Taff.
'We only had to go back a couple of miles,
'but it cost us two whole hours.'
Can't be more than five miles now, sir.
Sir.

Look.
Well, I suppose it was meant to be.
They've left their names.
There were five of them, apparently.
And there's a letter for the King of Norway with a note asking Captain Scott to be so kind as to deliver it.
He's forgotten to stamp it.
Birdie, you'd better check the position.
'The Pole.
'Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected.
'It's a bitter disappointment,
'and I am very sorry for my loyal companions.'
Smile, please.

'Now for the run home and a desperate struggle.
'I wonder if we can do it.'
Cherry asked me to give you this at the Pole.
Well done that man.
Sorry you chaps don't like chocolate.
- Soldier.
- Thank you, sir.
- Bill.
- Thank you.
- Birdie.
- Thank you, sir.
- Evans.
- Thank you, sir.
That hand still bothering you?
Hardly at all now, sir.
Well, lads, only 900 miles to go.
Ready?
Heave.
Ready?
Heave.
This is better, eh?
Birdie?
Your skis must be round here somewhere.
- Keep an eye open for them.
- Aye, aye, sir.
'The wind is playing strange tricks.
'Instead of blowing steadily northward, as it did when we came,
'it keeps dropping and leaving us the full weight of the sledge.'
Land-ho!
'I don't like the easy way
Oates and Evans get frostbitten.'
- Sir?
- Mm?
- You know where Teddy turned back.
- Yes. What about it?
According to that note of his, we've done the same distance half a day better.
Half a day. Do you hear that, Soldier?
We're half a day better than Teddy.
Good-oh!
A day's march nearer home, Birdie.
A day's march nearer steaks.
Large, thick, juicy, sizzly ones.
Oh, don't.
With mushrooms.
And beer.
And beer?
Beer of course, gallons of it.
Had an awful nightmare the other night, Birdie.
Dreamt that Simpson's had been burnt down.
Hello, Bill. What have you got this time?
Quite an interesting day.
This hoosh smells good. Yours, Con?
Birdie reckons we've done half a day's better time than Teddy did.
Good, good.
What are these, Bill?
Sea plants mostly, and some tree fossils.
Good heavens. This must have been quite a warm spot once upon a time.
And look at this.
Coal, by Jove.
"What's the prospect of trade between this city and the Antarctic?"
Coal, Evans. Catch.
Ooh!
- What's the matter, man?
- It's nothing, sir.
Quite all right.
Only a bit awkward, that's all.
'I am indeed glad to think that we've done with the plateau.
'Another week of those conditions might have had a very bad effect on Evans.'
See your flag anywhere, Birdie?
No sign of it, sir.
We'll try a bit back and to the right.
Evans, off with your harness.
Take the aft end of the sledge.
Understand?
Aye, aye, sir.
'There is no doubt
Evans is a good deal run down.
'I think Wilson, Bowers and I are as fit as possible,
'but Oates feels the cold and fatigue more than we do.'
Look out, steady!
There it is, sir. There's the flag.
A shadow.
'Evans keeps saying, as he would, that he's quite well.
'How can a man be quite well with hands like that?'
Halt.
Can't be far now.
Birdie, try up that hill.
See if you can see the cairn.
Right, sir.
What's wrong, Evans?
It's loose, sir. It's come loose, sir.
Have it right in a moment.
Hold on. I'll do it.
You get your harness off.
It's only my old hand, sir.
Makes me a bit slow.
I can't see the cairn, but I can see the Barrier.
How's that?
Try and move your foot.
- Sure you can manage?
- I'll be fine, sir.
That's the man, Taff. Take your time.
We'll be camping soon.
Ready? Heave.
Halt.
What is it, Taff?
I'm all right, sir, quite well.
Taff?
'It is a terrible thing to lose a companion in this way,
'to leave him here after all the miles we've sledged together.'
Plateau done, glacier done.
400 miles of Barrier and we're home.
We've got to do more miles a day, Bill.
We ought to find it warmer down here, anyhow.
Sir.
60 degrees of frost.
Can't last.
'Only five miles again yesterday.
'This will never do.'
Ready?
No, no, no.
Tortoise beat the hare in the end.
Right, Soldier?
Ready, sir.
Heave.
'There is no getting away from the fact that we are not going strong.
'And I'm afraid Soldier's foot is bad.'
When I get home,
I'm never going to walk another step.
- Ride wherever I go.
- Even in London?
London.
- Know the Empire promenade, Birdie?
- Funny thing, I've never been.
First night home, I'll be there.
You must take me with you, Titus.
But you'll have to leave your horse outside.
I ought to tell you that we haven't too much fuel in hand.
If we're still short at Mount Hooper, we'll try going on cold meals.
We may have no choice.
Funny, used to have what they call a good leg for a boot.
Wouldn't think it now, would you, Bill?
Bill, what chance have I got?
A good one, Titus.
How far is it to Mount Hooper depot now?
Eight and a half miles.
We'll do it in no time, Soldier.
Purely medicinal.
'What shall we find at Mount Hooper depot?
'If oil is short again...'
There she is.
See, old chap?
Managed it all right.
- Wasn't so bad.
- Get the spades, Birdie.
Here it is.
It's not full.
The seal's not broken.
Odd things happen out here.
It must be evaporation.
Yes, but...
Come on, chaps.
No good arguing the whys and wherefores.
Up tent.
'Among ourselves we are unendingly cheerful.
'But what each man feels in his heart,
I can only guess.'
Letting up a little, I think.
I hope I don't wake tomorrow, Bill.
I'm just going outside.
I may be away some time.
'A brave man and a gallant gentleman.
'This intense cold convinces me
'that the season has broken far earlier than I expected.'
We'll be all right at One Ton.
It's full of stuff.
I thought for a moment it might be old Titus.
Stupid of me.
Sorry.
Only 11 miles now, Bill. Two good marches.
One if the snow holds off.
'Captain Scott is now lying in this tent with a frozen foot.
'I am afraid he will never walk again.
'If the wind drops,
'Birdie and I are going to try to reach the next depot and return.
'We have come together
'1,800 miles,
'and are now only 11 miles from stores in plenty.
'Only 11 miles.'
11 miles.
11 miles.
'Think of me when you make those footmarks.'
'Every step of the way.'
'My own dearest mother,
'I should so like to have come through for your dear sake.
'It is splendid to pass, however,
'with such companions as I have.
'And as all five of us have mothers and wives,
'you will not be alone.
'There will be no shame
'and you will know
I have struggled to the end,
'your ever loving son,
'to the end of this life and the next,
'when God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes.'
'God knows I am sorry to be the cause of sorrow
'to anyone in the world.
'But everyone must die.
'All the things I had hoped to do with you after the expedition
'are as nothing now.
'My only regret is leaving you to struggle through your life alone.
'All is for the best to those who love God.
'And, oh, my Ori, we have both loved him with all our lives.
'All is well.'
'For my own sake,
I do not regret this journey.
'We took risks. We knew we took them.
'Things have come out against us.
'And therefore we have no cause for complaint.
'Had we lived,
'I should have had a tale to tell
'of the hardihood, endurance and courage of my companions,
'which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman.
'It seems a pity,
'but I don't think I can write more.
'These rough notes and our dead bodies
'must tell the tale.
'For God's sake,
'look after our people.'
Halt.

Doc Holiday just got off the stagecoach.
- Want me and the boys to come along?
- Why do you ask that?
Well, I certainly wouldn't want to fool around with him alone.
I don't blame ya, but I'm not gonna make any trouble for Doc Holiday.
He's my best friend.
As long as I'm sheriff around here the place is his.
Hi. Where's Doc Holiday?
In here, Pat.
Hi, Pat.
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.
Doc, how are you?
You're looking plenty sassy.
You wintered kind of fat, didn't you?
- What are you doing over this way?
- I wanted to have a talk with you.
The other is, have you seen anything of a little strawberry roan?
- Somebody steal your horse?
- Yeah.
Cutest little fellow you ever saw.
Mean as mean, but I'd dote on him like he was pure rock candy.
- What are you laughing at?
- Joke's on whoever done it.
First time I ever felt sorry for a horse thief.
- Did you hear he was headed this way?
- Yeah.
Put that on the table in there.
What are you gonna have?
I started with rye.
I don't see no cause to change.
- Where you been keeping yourself?
- Mostly across the border.
That's what I want to see you about.
I need a little money and I thought you might want to come in with me.
- What's the matter?
- I'll let you have the money... but if the deal is like that last one of yours, better not tell me about it.
Why not?
- Where'd you get that thing?
- They stuck it on me little while ago.
You're the last man I ever thought would be so easily satisfied.
Man's gotta settle down sometime.
Mike, did you see anything of a strange strawberry roan?
About 13 hands high and as cute as bug's ear.
Seems to me I did see one about that size.
- When I came on duty.
- Where?
- Up in front of the dentist place.
- Where's that?
I'll show you.
I'm only gonna tell you once more.
You put that glass... on top of your head.
But what are you gonna do then?
Just put it up on your head.
I'll show you.
Best thing in the world for that dandruff of yours.
Wait a minute, Doc.
Hello, Fred.
Hello, Pat.
You're still using that one, huh?
My old standby.
Never has failed yet.
How many fingers do you see, Fred?
I guess I better take Fred to the jail and let him sober up there.
You go ahead. The dentist's place is up the street near the corner.
I'll be along in a minute.
Well, Red, how ya feelin'?
Hello.
- Nice little horse you got here.
- I think so.
- Where'd you get him?
- Bought him in Santa Fe Springs. Why?
Somebody stole him from me in Sacora.
If it wasn't for those two guns,
I'd say you was hiding in pretty young.
- You think it was me?
- You haven't told me any different.
I ain't going to.
My name's Holiday.
Doc Holiday?
- I've heard of you.
- Thanks.
I don't want to take advantage of you.
Thanks. I thought it'd be the other way around.
What's your name, son?
Bonny. William Bonny.
- Billy the Kid, huh?
- Still think I stole your horse?
- How much did you pay for him?
- Wouldn't do any good if I told you.
- Why not?
- I like the horse and got used to him.
- So have I.
- I don't blame you.
- Just like sitting in a rocking chair.
- Now look...
- Hear you're pretty good.
- That's what I hear about you.
All right. You mind standing away from the front of that horse?
Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?
No sense in going to all this trouble for nothing.
That's right.
Hello, Doc.
Had any luck?
- Yes and no.
- It's your horse, ain't it?
It was.
You're a cool one.
Better get you over to the hoosegow before this gets around.
Come along. Thanks, Doc, for being so forbearing.
All right.
See why I left off?
He's just a kid.
I told you to come along.
Didn't you hear what I said?
I heard you.
You're not doing any better than I did.
Wait a minute. I'd like to make you acquainted with this young man.
Billy, this is an old friend of mine, Pat Garrett.
Pat, this is Mr. William Bonny.
I've been wanting to meet you for a long time.
How are you, Billy?
How many fingers do you see?
You ought to use that only on friends.
While you two are talking I better put my horse away. Back up, boy.
- Why you...
- Hold it. Don't fly off the handle.
Nice little horse, ain't he, Doc?
- Remember me?
- Where's Mr. Garrett?
I sent him home. How 'bout you and me having a little talk?
I don't believe in talk, unless the other fella holds all the cards.
Sonny, that head of yours sure is screwed on tight.
If it wasn't, somebody would have knocked it off long ago.
I guess that's right. How did you know
Pat was gonna hit you out there?
Well, it's the first time a sheriff ever wanted to shake hands with me.
- He heard you say "shake hands."
- Huh?
How do you do, Mr. Horse?
I'm pleased to meet you.
I'll swear, I didn't know he could do tricks.
What else can he do?
You back up there and I'll make him take those gloves right out of your belt.
Over that way a little.
Now back a little farther.
That's far enough, kid.
Put your hands up.
All right, Doc.
- This is new for you, ain't it?
- What?
Bein' arrested for horse stealin'.
Doc, you know I didn't steal that horse any more than you did.
Billy, many a true word is spoken in jest.
This is something new for you too, isn't it, Doc?
Yeah, what's that?
The Great Doc Holiday getting someone else to help him.
And a policeman at that.
I can hardly believe it.
And after the way I've heard people talk about you... ever since I was in short pants.
That's enough of that.
Turn around.
- Now walk out that door.
- Wait a minute.
Why?
Well, this thing don't seem to sit right on my stomach, no how.
What?
Doc, you're not gonna back out on me?
I'm afraid I am.
I'd never hear the end of this.
Hold on!
I'm not through with you yet.
Step aside, Doc.
He may shoot me in the back.
They tell me that's the way you've given it to some of the boys.
Now, Pat, that's a pretty strong thing to say.
I never heard that.
Well, Mr. Garrett, if you believe that... here's your chance to do the same to me.
Coming, Doc?
I think I will.
I want the two of you out of this town by sundown.
What did I do?
That's all right, Doc.
You've got the right to choose your friends.
Shucks. I don't take kindly to that at all.
He knows there's no stage until tomorrow... and he knows that I'm afoot.
Or am I?
- Not by a darn sight.
- You mean that, son?
Sure. We'll dig you up another horse somewhere.
- I guess that's enough for me.
- Cleaned out?
Not quite.
- Where you stoppin', son?
- I got a room at the hotel.
Doc, could I see you a minute?
Sure. You might as well cash me in.
All right.
What's on your mind, son?
No offense, Doc, but that last ace you just drew...
What about it?
I got a feeling I saw it on the bottom of the deck.
- Are you sure?
- Wouldn't have asked if I was.
That's where you showed good sense.
Here you are, Doc... 640.
Thanks.
You could have paid four times for the horse and still saved money.
That's right.
Hope you're satisfied now.
- You gonna turn in?
- I think I will.
I'll walk down to the hotel with you.
Good night, gents, and thanks.
Good night.
If you're not already fixed up, you can bunk with me tonight.
No thanks, Billy.
I've got a girl. She and her aunt just moved into town.
You got a girl?
I ain't got nothin', except that horse.
You can't fool me. A good-looking boy like you must have a girl somewhere.
No. I don't trust 'em.
You're pretty young to talk like that.
Well, I've known quite a few.
And they all did you dirty, eh, every one of them?
Yeah, every one of 'em.
That's too bad, Billy.
I guess things haven't been so easy for you, have they?
Tell you what I'm going to do.
Since that horse means so much to you,
I'm going to make you a present of him.
That's awful nice of you.
Thanks a lot.
All right. Good night.
See you in the morning.
Good night.
Just thought I'd say good night to the horse.
If you're all through, you might as well put him back in his stall.
All right.
Good night, Red.
See you tomorrow.
What, no kiss?
He don't like mush.
Back in your stall, Red.
- That's my tobacco, isn't it?
- I think it is.
You don't mind if I take that, do you?
Red, I think I'll bunk right here tonight, if you don't object.
Say, what is this anyway?
What are you shooting at me for?
Are you crazy?
Stop it.
Cut it out, do you hear?
Can you understand English?
What's your name?
- Rio.
- What's the rest of it?
McDonald.
Where'd you come from?
What do you care?
- Where'd you live before you came here?
- Sacora.
Oh, yeah. Who was he?
My brother.
He shouldn't have taken so much tequila.
- What became of the girl?
- She married a guy two weeks later.
Well, that's the way it is.
How'd I know he was your brother?
It was him or me.
And I didn't lay for him in no barn neither.
- I'm sorry I was so rough with you.
- You didn't hurt me.
You sure?
- It's too bad I didn't know.
- What?
- He was your brother.
- What's that got to do with it?
Well, maybe I wouldn't have tried so hard to get the other girl.
Oh, you wouldn't.
What's the matter?
- There's a rock under here.
- Let me fix it.
Let me go!
Hold still, lady, or you won't have much dress left.
Let me go!
- He did not.
- I say he did.
- Did you really hear him holler?
- Sure I did.
- So did I.
- Then that ain't Billy the Kid.
Shucks, a dentist can make anybody holler.
Look out.
Here he comes.
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Doc.
- I'm in no hurry.
- You're the Billy the Kid?
- That's what they tell me.
- See, what did I tell you?
- Wait. One at a time.
Have you really got
20 notches in your gun?
Is it true you got 13 Indian scalps in your war bag?
Had to throw 'em away.
The moths got to them.
Tanning 'em the best way to keep them.
- Is that a fact?
- That's what my pa told me.
- What are you doing with that?
- Trying get bark off to make a whistle.
- Have you sucked it?
- I sucked it till it near dry.
Can't you shoot the insides out?
- Put it up on that post.
- Can't I hold it?
- Can you hold it steady?
- Sure!
Billy, you don't have to prove anything to me.
It's all right.
Turn the end up a little.
Little more.
You hit it!
- Don't you take aim?
- I took aim.
- When?
- Before I drew.
Look, Billy, it's all right.
You fixed it fine. Thanks.
- Glad to help.
- Anything I can do, let me know.
- That's a new one on me.
- What?
Aiming before you draw.
- I've got to.
- Why?
My hand seems to be a little quicker than my eye.
Well, ain't that too bad.
- Where'd you get the horse?
- I bought this one.
- Looks all right.
- He'll do for the time being.
Ham and eggs.
Fry the eggs on both sides.
I'll take the same.
Mine straight up.
How 'bout a cold hand while we're waiting?
How much?
- How's that?
- Suits me.
Before you get started
I'd like to speak to you for a minute.
- Who is he?
- I don't know.
- What do you want?
- Let's go in the backroom.
Why?
You don't know me, but we have a mutual friend.
Who?
And I don't like him any better than you do.
Oh, Garrett, eh?
The name sounds familiar.
- Figure on staying in town tonight?
- Why?
Everybody knows that Garrett told you to get out of town.
Sooner or later you're gonna have a little trouble with him.
I thought I might give you a hand.
That's very kind of you, mister.
Listen. I ain't doing you no favor.
It'll be a pleasure.
Now what I figure is when he's arguing with you, he won't watch anyone else.
So, it'll be a cinch for me.
Be careful you don't knock me over with the same bullet.
Don't worry.
I'll stand at an angle.
I'll do it like this.
Suppose this chair is Garrett there.
And if you're standing about where you are... why, I'll be over here.
Do you mind if I draw my gun so you can see the line of fire?
No, go right ahead.
- It's me, Billy.
- Come on in, Doc.
- What happened?
- He's a pretty smart hombre.
You know him?
He's been hanging around trying to talk
Garrett into making him a deputy.
I guess he figured if he got Billy he'd be a hero... he could have the deputy job, or run for governor if he wanted it.
- Better get out of here, son.
- Why? He pulled on me first.
- Be hard to make Garrett believe that.
- We'll see.
Where's my dough?
Well, I guess I must've picked it up.
You're foolish to stick around, son.
I think I'd be more foolish to pull out.
Then Garrett would be sure that was my fault.
Come on. Cut for deal.
- You meant you want to play poker.
- That's right.
You're not worried about me if I tangle with Garrett, are you?
Fights pretty good.
I know him better than you do.
All right, if he's so good... then you'll get your horse back, won't you?
Say, I never thought of that.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- Lend me a hundred.
- I never lend money in a poker game.
Spoils my luck.
But I'd be glad to have you put up the horse for a hundred.
I guess you would.
Hello, Pat.
Care for a bite to eat, boys?
A little hand of poker?
No thanks, Doc.
Were you in there when it happened?
No. But listen, Pat, he pulled on Billy first.
- How do you know?
- His gun was on the floor.
That don't prove nothing.
Pat, you've got an ugly temper and you're letting it get the best of you.
You have no right to hold Billy for this killing, and you know it.
You're just sore at him, that's all.
Doc, I'm gonna give you a chance to stay out of this.
- Thanks.
- Your horse is outside. Get on him.
- Good luck to you.
- Same to you.
What are you waitin' for?
He's waiting for those chickens of yours to hatch.
Are you gonna put up a fight?
I'll tell you one thing.
I ain't going to jail for no killing I was pushed into.
- Thanks, Doc.
- What are you trying to do?
I still think that fella pulled first on Billy.
Are you throwing off on me again?
Then what do you call it?
Since I figure that this is a personal matter between you and Billy...
I don't think you ought to bring in all this hired help.
I only did that to keep Billy from putting up a fight... so I wouldn't have to kill him.
Do you stuff birds too?
You're making a big mistake... turning on an old friend, all because of a little snip... who's never given anybody nothing except the back of his hand.
Speaking of hands...
Come on. Let's get out of here before this hothead makes us plug him.
He ain't gonna run me out of town.
If you wanna hold the fort while
I ride off on your little horse... it's all right with me.
Well, since you put it that way.
Go ahead, son.
Take it easy, Pat.
Doc, this finishes you and me for good and all.
I'm sorry.
- Can you get up, son?
- I don't know.
- Can you make it to the horse?
- I think so.
Did you see what that little horse did, pulling me out like that?
He's a regular bird dog.
I gotta get you under cover some place.
I'm all right.
Charlie, you better stay here and have a look around town.
That kid's got a bullet in him.
He ain't going far. Let's go.
Who's that?
Quit that yelling.
Get these horses out of sight.
This is Billy the Kid.
He got a bad one on the left side... but the bullet didn't hit anything vital and it came out in the back.
Don't move him at all or the bleeding will start again.
I guess you better cut his clothes off.
Put a bandage on the wound and see that it's always moist.
Keep him warm and dry.
If he gets a chill, he's a goner.
If he goes out of his head, tie him down.
The neighbors hear him yelling, tell them your aunt has smallpox.
That'll keep them away.
I guess that's all.
Now do your best for this boy.
If I can't come back,
I'll send word where I am.
And Billy can bring you along.
Shoo, shoo!
Face like a baby.
He's so hot.
He's no hotter than your brother Julio was.
He's soaking wet again.
Get me some sheets,
Aunt Guadalupe.
Get them yourself.
- What's the matter with you?
- I wouldn't lift a finger for him.
What's the matter?
- Been lookin' for him around here.
- Well, ain't that too bad.
Chico, what's the matter with you?
He smells the blood.
He was just getting ready to peck his eyes out.
You stay out of here.
- Your name McDonald?
- What do you wanna know for?
Why don't you wanna tell me?
- Yes, that's my name. Why?
- Your father's name is...
Woodruff. Charlie Woodruff.
I used to work for him when he was Tom Motsacoro.
Oh, yes. I guess I was a little girl then.
- Charlie!
- Aunt Guadalupe!
- How you been?
- Very well. Thank you.
You're getting fat as a pig.
- What are you doing up here?
- I've been working with the sheriff.
We're looking for Billy the Kid.
You get out of here!
- Come in and sit down.
- Some other time.
I'll drop in the first chance I get.
- What's wrong with that bird?
- Nothing.
I have a hen sitting under the bed and he likes to peck at her.
- Want me to get him out of there?
- No. Everything's all upset in there.
We just got up.
Good-bye. I'm glad to have seen you.
Same here.
So long, Aunt Guadalupe.
- I'll walk down a ways with you.
- No, you won't. Lunch is all ready.
Good-bye.
I'll fix you.
How's Billy?
Looks like he's having a chill.
A chill?
Where are you?
Right here.
- Don't go away.
- I won't.
- I'm so cold.
- I'll get you warm.
- Don't go away.
- I'll only be a minute.
How can you stop a thing like this?
- You're mad at me.
- No.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- Why do you hide from me?
- I'll be right back.
- Where's that bottle of whiskey?
- I finished it.
The time I had that bad cough.
I fired those hot stones for Julio, but it was just the same.
He shook like a leaf till he died.
You get out of here and shut the door.
What?
Just get out of here.
Have you gone crazy?
You can bring the minister tomorrow if it'll make you feel better about it.
Now get out.
You're not gonna die.
I'll get you warm.
Well, Red, you can't stand this pace much longer.
I guess I'll just have to slow those boys down a little.
None of my affair, but we crossed the county line ten minutes ago.
That's right, Swanson.
It's none of your affair.
Break up!
Scatter for those rocks!
You look different today.
You look better.
Say, is that you?
What are you doing here?
I live here.
Well, I've been trying to figure this out.
- How'd I get here?
- Doc brought you.
Oh. Are you Doc's girl?
What do you know about that.
Be careful your wound.
You'll hurt yourself.
That's right. I remember now.
- I caught one yesterday, didn't I?
- Yesterday?
It was a month ago.
You've been terribly sick.
A month? That's a long time.
- How's Red?
- Red?
- Have you been takin' good care of him?
- Who's Red?
Didn't Doc leave my horse here?
Well, I'll swear. I didn't think he'd do a thing like that.
Behind my back too.
Is he all right again?
Say, who's this old lollipop?
It's my Aunt Guadalupe.
¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo está?
You haven't got a ham sandwich on you?
You hungry? I don't think we have anything cooked beside some beans.
That'll do for a starter, eh, lollipop?
Say, you don't talk like a sick man.
Who said I was?
What does that "lollipop" mean?
Oh, something sweet.
Sweet?
Sweet, like candy.
You know, dulce.
Is that a fact?
Where are you going?
Oh, to see if I can find a fresh egg or two.
- How do you feel?
- Fine. When do we eat?
- You just had lunch about an hour ago.
- Honest?
Will you bring me my clothes?
I want to have a look around.
What for?
I can't spend the rest of my life in bed.
Anyway, I want to see if I can find my ring.
Your ring?
Yeah. I had a ring on this finger and it's gone.
I've been worried about it.
You mustn't be upset about a thing like that.
You can get another one, can't you?
This one's been kind of lucky for me.
It belonged to a fellow who was supposed to have had a charmed life... as long as he kept it on his finger.
Then how did you get it?
Did you kill him?
No. Somebody else did that.
Then the ring wasn't so lucky for him after all, was it?
Well, nothing happened to him until he took it off to wash his hands.
No, you better not get up till tomorrow.
- You said that yesterday.
- You're not strong enough yet.
Who says I'm not?
Billy, you mustn't.
You'll hurt yourself.
Then why don't you quit wrestling with me?
But you've been so sick.
You're not well enough. You're not...
Rio!
Come on. I want you to go down to the store with me.
I have some washing to do.
You've got all afternoon to do it.
Come on.
- I have to fix my hair first.
- All right, hurry up then.
- Why do you have to go with her?
- I better.
What if somebody should come by... like that deputy sheriff friend of yours the other day?
Yes, that's right.
I'll go tell Aunt Guadalupe.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Doc.
Hurry up!
Open this door here.
Coming.
Hello, Doc.
Glad to see you, Doc!
You'd never know it. I thought
I'd have to break the door down.
It's the rain, Doc.
I couldn't hear a thing, Doc.
You don't need to yell so loud.
I'm not deaf.
Did you ever see such a storm, and it's been going on for four days?
It was lucky for me. The only way
I could shake those bloodhounds.
Washed out all your tracks, huh?
Hungry?
First sit down I've had since I left here.
How's Billy?
Oh, he's fine, sure.
He's been up almost a week now.
Good.
Where's Rio?
So that's what all the yellings about, eh?
- I'll go and call her for you.
- Wait a minute.
You made enough noise now to raise the dead.
So that's it?
All right, where is he?
He's getting dressed.
Maybe I better give him a hand.
No, Doc! Please let me talk to you first!
What got into you? Were you drunk?
What happened to you?
I don't know.
He's a devil.
He did the same to me.
He can charm a bird right out of a bush.
- I never saw it to fail.
- Don't talk that way.
What do you want me to say... bless you, my children?
You might as well.
Huh?
I'm married to him.
You're what?
That's the truth, Doc.
Only please don't tell him.
Tell who?
Billy.
- You mean he doesn't know it?
- No.
Then how could you be married to him?
He was out of his mind.
I never would have done it, only I thought he was gonna die.
And so he would have, if it hadn't been for you.
I don't want his gratitude.
Guess I should've stayed out in the rain with the sheriff.
- Make me a cup of coffee.
- Sure.
It's a good thing you don't want his gratitude.
Why do you say that?
You know, when I come to think of it... after what you done to me,
I couldn't wish you anything better... than you hooking up with Billy.
What do you mean?
I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.
Hello, Doc.
Is that all you got to say to me?
Now look here, Doc, I'm sorry, but it's your own fault.
Oh, my fault, huh?
Who brought me here?
Now you want to switch the blame on me.
First you take my horse, then my girl... and both times it's all my fault.
That reminds me of something else.
You ran away with Red, didn't you?
You think that's any excuse?
It was good enough for me.
- There's only one trouble with it.
- What's that?
The horse was mine too.
I wasn't in much shape to argue that with you, was I?
No, I guess you weren't.
But you didn't have use for that horse lying flat on your back, or did you?
All right, Doc, if that's your way of looking at it.
You just took the loan of him, so to speak.
What are you getting at?
Yes, that's what
I'd like to know.
You borrow from me...
I borrow from you.
What does that mean?
Let's have a cup of java.
We better be getting out of here.
Not at those prices.
All right, Doc,
I'll tell you what I'll do.
What's that?
Well, just to show you my heart's in the right place...
I'll let you take your pick.
Huh?
You mean you'd trade me for a horse?
It's up to Doc. After all, I've got to think of the other fellow, you know.
I appreciate that.
I sure do.
Billy, you don't mean that.
And after all she did for you.
Say, you should have seen what that little horse did for me, huh, Doc?
That's right.
I hope you won't think too hard of me... but under the circumstances...
I'm going to take the horse.
- You are?
- You're not satisfied?
Listen, Doc,
I like that little horse.
What'd I tell you, huh?
- I still can't believe it.
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- What's eating you?
Nothing!
Here. Fill these with fresh water.
The creeks are muddy as all get out.
How about grub?
Can you spare enough flour and bacon to get us to Fort Sumner?
Sure.
Hey, it's clearing up.
We better be getting out of here.
Lend me some dough, will you?
How much do you want?
About 50 bucks.
Here's 40.
Here.
Buy yourself a horse and buggy.
Don't you think it's too much?
You can give Aunt Guadalupe 20 if you want.
If we get located in Fort Sumner,
I'll send for you.
What for?
I can't stand ranch cooking.
Here you are.
- Thanks. Good-bye.
- Bye, Doc.
Bye, lollipop.
Bye, Billy.
Take care of yourself.
You do the same.
Fill these up for Doc.
Hello, you old hay bag.
Have ya missed me?
He's thin as a rail.
He's been getting a little exercise.
Where'd you get that plug?
Wore out the black horse I had, so I traded him to sheep herder for this one.
He's all right.
Little wild yet.
Come on.
Ain't Red a sweetheart?
I'm going to let you have a loan of him for a little while.
- Until you get your strength back.
- You're not gonna do me any favors.
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't wanna be obligated about Red.
- Why not?
- I'm not giving up on getting him back... anymore than I've given up getting on this ornery goat.
Bye, Rio.
- What's the matter?
- Boy, am I tuckered.
- What are you lookin' for?
- A sink of tobacco.
Say, is there anything of mine you don't cotton to?
- I guess I forgot.
- Yeah, it's a bad habit you got.
- What?
- Forgettin' what belongs to others.
- You think I did it on purpose?
- Yes.
- Listen, I don't feel good as it is.
- Neither do I.
You wanna make something out of it?
- That's a big advantage you're taking.
- I can't help it.
I'm so plumb beat out,
I'll be lucky if I can draw 'em clear.
I don't want to crowd a sick man.
I'm all right. Just give me 40 winks and I'll take ya with both hands free.
I guess this is as good a place as any to make camp.
There's no water.
And you won't find any between here and Fort Sumner.
That's a long ways off.
When we get there our friend, the sheriff, won't be far behind.
Huh?
Garrett?
How do you know it's him?
I can tell him farther off than that.
He wouldn't be coming after the two of us alone.
Maybe he's lost too many of his friends.
How come you didn't knock him over?
Or did you try?
- Did I?
- That's what I said. Did ya?
Didn't do nothin' else.
Who do you suppose put him on our trail?
Well, maybe somebody saw us pulling out or...
Or what?
Nothing.
- Sure, she was the one.
- Yeah, Rio.
Why do you suppose she had to up and do a thing like that?
Well, women are funny.
Go easy on that water. We've only got two canteens to get us to Fort Sumner.
What's the matter?
Look!
Sweet spirited miter.
The little darling put sand in it instead of water.
That sure is one for the book.
Well, no use hanging 'round here till morning. Let's get going.
You know, Doc, I think
I'll have another drink.
What are you talking about?
You didn't have one in the first place.
No, but I had the same notion about an hour ago.
I know what you're thinking, but it won't do you any good.
- Take my advice.
- What?
Killing a woman.
- Why not?
- They're all alike.
There isn't anything they wouldn't do for you... or to you.
Hey, why didn't you wake me up?
We should've gotten started long ago.
Keep 'em up!
Hello, Pat.
- Where's Billy?
- Looks like he left ya.
And on my horse, eh?
Try those on.
You know me.
Do I have to put these on?
I know ya.
Put 'em on!
That was pretty smart, putting sand in those canteens.
I had to give you something for your money, didn't I?
Oh, I see.
So you sent the sheriff after us for good measure, huh?
No wonder he came alone.
All he had to do was take his time and wait for the sun to finish us off.
Then how did you get back?
It was pretty tough... but the more I thought about seeing you, darling... the easier it got.
Then what are you waiting for?
Go ahead.
Say, that sounds real nice.
I like to hear you ask for it.
Keep it up.
Beg some more.
What would you like me to say?
Well, you might say "please" very sweetly.
Please.
Will you keep your eyes open?
Yes.
Will you look right at me while I do it?
What is it?
Everybody drinks but me.
I'm supposed to be a camel, huh?
You want a drink, you can climb down and get it.
Say, did you hear something?
- What kind of a track is that?
- I don't know.
Too small for a man.
Here's another one.
Couple over there.
Well, take a look at that.
Yeah, it's an old Indian trick soaking rawhide in water to make it shrink.
Another hour, she'd have been hanging by her wrists.
Well, I'll say one thing for Billy.
He sure does pay off poetic.
He put her right where she could see the water.
He just left here less than half an hour ago.
He went that way, toward those mountains.
- Are you all right? Sit.
- Don't worry about me. Go after him.
- We can't catch him now.
- Why not?
He's got too much of a head start on us. Sit down.
You know, I think he's in love with you.
What are you talking about?
The crazier a man is about a woman, the crazier he thinks and does.
He's only crazy about one thing: Himself.
Say, that gives me a thought.
Maybe we'll get Mr. Billy after all.
- How?
- Just like he says.
If he's crazy enough to do you like this... maybe he's just crazy enough to come back to turn you loose.
You're the one that's crazy.
He doesn't care anything about me.
He'd never come back.
Maybe so, but it's worth trying.
Ain't it, Doc?
If he's fool enough to come back, he oughta get himself caught.
I told you not to breathe so loud.
All right, all right.
Well, how do you like it?
I thought I tied it tighter than that.
- You came back.
- Not on your account, I didn't.
- You didn't?
- You see Doc and the sheriff?
Here we are, Billy, right behind ya.
Now put those hands where they belong.
Say, why didn't you tip me off?
Hurry up with that grub.
I wanna get to town before dark.
- Well, I've only got two hands.
- Why don't you use both of 'em?
- I'll use one on you in a minute.
- I wouldn't put it past ya.
Now's your chance with me all trussed up like a chicken.
Here we are together again.
Same old happy family.
Yeah, and I'd have been halfway to
Fort Sumner if it hadn't been for you.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
Give me a cigarette.
- You mean her.
- Rio! Are you out of your mind?
- Come out and admit it like a man.
- Admit what?
You didn't know Pat caught me until you got back to our camp, did ya?
- Then why come after us?
- Why not?
We'd have been clear to Lincoln before you even got back here.
Say, mister, what are you trying to make out?
I heard you say once you didn't like ranch cooking... so I guess you figured you'd better come back and get Rio.
You're daffy. I wouldn't come back two inches to get her.
- You did.
- I tell you I didn't.
- Actions speak louder than words.
- Do they?
I'll show you how much
I care about her.
If you want her back, you can have her.
Now what do you think about that?
I don't want her.
- Cattle don't graze after sheep.
- Sheep?
Sheep did you say?
I didn't say goats or monkeys.
Why you.
Ah, sit down.
- What's the matter with you?
- None of your business!
Careful, young fella.
You want it now?
I've just been waitin' for an excuse like this.
I'll fix you up.
Never mind fixin' any more food.
We're leavin' now. Come on.
Let me get a drink first.
All right, hurry up.
Hey, Rio, come here and hold my hands so I won't fall in.
Come out of there!
You're all right now.
Come on.
You figure on taking us back to Lincoln, ain't ya?
Where did ya think
I was takin' ya?
- It's over that way, ain't it?
- Sure. What are you gettin' at?
Take a look.
Hey, Doc.
Well, the Mescaleros are out early this year.
They're talkin' about us, ain't they?
Yeah. They're tippin' off another hunting party that must be out.
Right over there.
On both sides of us.
I guess our best chance is to hightail it to Fort Sumner.
Don't figure on me doing much hightailing.
- Why not?
- I ain't no acrobat.
I hope you fellas have sense enough to behave yourselves.
Sure, Pat, certainly.
Sure, Pat.
No, ya don't!
- That's your horse over there.
- Who says so?
I say so.
Get on him and hurry up.
Rio, you ride the paint.
Thanks.
Hey, Red's my horse.
I know he is, but I'm gonna ride him.
I don't like this.
Looks like some of those Mescaleros are ahead of us too.
No, you better not come over here, Rio.
- Why not?
- They put the fire on them.
Those Mescaleros sure do play for keeps.
Say, what's that?
It's a good size party. We'll be knee-deep in them in a minute.
Look over there too.
- Hey, what are ya doin'?
- What do ya think? I want my gun.
Now wait a minute.
You're not gonna argue at a time like this. Aren't you gonna give us a chance?
He'd like to see them put the fire on me.
- I sure would.
- What about her?
We can't talk about it now.
I want to know one thing.
Do I have your solemn promise that you'll give them back when I ask?
- Sure. What do you think we are?
- Will you see to it that he does?
Who's gonna see to it that I do?
I'll take your word for it.
- Where are my cartridges?
- Here you are.
Now what do we do?
Make a stand or run for it?
- Can't make a stand here.
- I know something that might work.
- What is it?
- Come on. Do exactly what I do.
Cut him loose!
I know this place. We're about
40 miles from Fort Sumner.
Senor Garrett, what are you doing out this late?
Hello, Pablo.
Can you put us up for the night?
Sure, glad to have you. Come right in.
My house is yours.
I'll take care of the horses.
Well, boys, I guess we're out of the woods now, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
I wouldn't be too sure of that, Pat.
Oh, yes, he's right, Pat.
Those Mescaleros don't give up so easy.
This is very important.
I want you to ride to Fort Sumner... and give this note to the town marshal.
Did he say "town marshal"?
That's what it sounded like to me.
Thanks, Rio.
It certainly is a beautiful night out.
I think I'll take a little stroll.
And, gentlemen, just in case
I shouldn't return before you retire...
I'll say good night now.
I think I'll go with ya.
Well, Billy, you've been pretty good to my little horse.
I guess the least I can do is let you say good-bye to him.
That's awfully nice of you, Doc.
Oh, I always like to think of the other fella.
So if you just stand right here in this doorway... and don't make no warlike moves... then you can wave farewell to 'im as we ride off.
In other words, you think you're gonna leave.
I'm sorry, Pat, I hate to eat and run, but you know how it is.
- Listen, Doc.
- You're wasting your time, Pat.
Haven't you forgotten something?
No, I don't think so.
Good night all.
Say, Doc.
Yes, what is it?
I'm afraid you'll have to listen to me for a minute.
Why?
What if I don't feel like waving good-bye to Red?
You still think you got something to say about that horse, eh?
Yes, I do.
All right, go ahead and say it.
That's a pretty big advantage to give a man like you.
Didn't you tell me that once?
How's this?
You don't have to go that far.
Thanks.
What about him?
Will he leave us alone?
Or do you think we ought to pull his teeth before we start?
Don't worry about me.
I wouldn't lift a finger, Doc, to keep you from killing him.
You and me never had any trouble till he came along.
He'll keep out of it.
All right, son, I'm waiting.
Put those plates down.
You're makin' me nervous.
- Billy, he'll kill ya.
- What do you care?
- But you can get another horse.
- I want this one.
Why?
I wanna see if I can teach him to make smoke come out of his ears.
Say, I haven't got all night.
Get back against that wall.
- But Billy...
- Go on!
And count up to three.
I won't. You're outta your mind, both of ya.
How about you, Pat?
Sure, I'll be glad to.
You're too willing.
I don't trust you.
I think I'd rather have that cuckoo clock do the counting for me.
Yeah, that's good enough.
It's gonna strike in a minute.
Should we pull on the last cuckoo?
All right.
Well, Billy, I guess this is it.
Men are pretty much like children after all.
Have you ever seen two kids wrestling in the yard?
They push and tussle and maybe they look like they're fighting... but they're not.
They're really friends... and everything's in fun.
Then pretty soon, they play a little too rough... one of 'em gets mad... and in the end, somebody always gets hurt.
So for you and me, this is where somebody gets hurt.
But when it's over... and however it turns out, son... no hard feelings.
Why didn't you draw?
Why did you change your mind?
This some trick of yours?
No, I just don't feel like it.
Maybe I ate too much.
Perhaps some other night you will feel like it, eh?
Who knows?
I never wanted it, but I've waited and let you pick... your own time and place.
You've done that tonight.
You gonna draw, or do I have to make you?
Are you gonna fight... or do you want me to nick your ears?
Doc, have you gone loco?
What's the matter with you, Billy?
I didn't think you'd take this off anybody.
Maybe I wouldn't, off anybody else.
What do you mean by that?
Doc, don't listen to that kind of talk.
Haven't you ever seen cold feet before?
He never had cold feet in his life.
What is it, Billy?
I guess the idea about the cuckoo clock wasn't so good.
Why?
Well, it gave me time to think and remember a few things.
You're the only partner
I ever had.
Gosh, do you really feel that way, son?
- I treated you worse than anyone.
- Nah, it was all my fault.
- Wouldn't want Red carrying both of us.
- Oh, don't worry.
We can find a better way than that to divide 'im up.
Say, you can ride 'im outta here.
No, I had him last.
That's right, come to think of it.
I ain't worried about you and me ever fighting now, Billy... because one thing is certain.
If we didn't do it tonight, we never will.
Come on. Let's go.
So long, Pat.
Don't take any wooden nickels.
You're not going with him.
Look here, you ain't gonna start something with the two of us, are ya?
I might've known you'd do this to me.
Ever since you met him, you've treated me like a dog.
The very first day, you sided with him against me... and made me the laughingstock of the town!
Take it easy.
I gave you your guns so you'd have a chance for your life.
And now you tell me I gotta fight the two of you to get them back.
You stand there, side by side... with that little snip of a kid against me... me, the oldest and best friend you ever had!
And I still would be if it wasn't for him!
Say, mister, that's about enough outta you for one night.
Wait a minute.
You let me handle this.
Pat is a friend of mine.
I don't want to kill him, and
I don't want you to kill him. Clear?
Pat, you're just getting yourself all steamed up.
I'll be seeing you one of these days, and we'll have a good laugh about this.
Now, so long.
Be careful. You know you haven't got a chance against me.
Good-bye.
- Say.
- No, son, please, don't do that.
Oh, Doc, lie down.
Why not?
That's one thing
I've always been afraid of.
- What?
- Dying in bed.
Why didn't you shoot?
You had me beat by a mile.
You had me cold.
Maybe I don't like cold meat.
Well, go ahead.
Go ahead, what?
Aren't you going to say something over Doc?
I don't know what to say.
I never said anything over anybody
I killed before.
I think we oughta say something over Doc.
You better do it.
So long, Doc.
I want you to know I'm sorry.
I honestly am.
Last night I was ready to kill you... but in the daylight,
I can see things much better.
You and Doc have been friends for years.
If I hadn't come between ya, none of this would've happened.
It sure is funny... how two or three trails can cross... and get all tangled up.
Well, go ahead.
After you.
Say, you don't think I'd shoot you in the back, do you?
I don't know, but I ain't gonna tempt ya.
I don't think you'd be fool enough to try to do it from the front.
You never trust anybody, do you?
I apologize, Pat.
Go ahead.
Who's that?
- Where's Pat?
- He's still in the house.
- What's he doin'?
- He's not gonna try to stop you.
- How do you know?
- He told me so.
Say, Billy, can I see you for a minute?
What do you want?
If that's the way ya feel about it, never mind.
At least I'm not afraid to turn my back on you.
Here. Hold these a minute.
I thought you might like to have Doc's guns as a keepsake.
Say, I sure would.
Thanks, Pat.
Thanks a whole lot.
I never had an extra pair.
Black holsters too.
They'd go nice with Sunday clothes, if I ever get any.
Do you think they'll suit ya?
If the barrels ain't too long.
No, they're just the same.
Be careful. They're loaded.
That's right.
I think they're better balanced than mine.
Then how about letting me have yours?
My guns? What for?
If I had your guns...
I could say it was you out there in that grave, instead of Doc.
You'd pass Doc off as me?
Sure.
Everybody would believe me once they saw your six-shooters.
You could leave an end to your trail right here.
Nobody'd follow you up north.
All your troubles would be buried... past and present.
You and Rio could go off with nothing to worry about.
How come you'd do a favor like that for me?
There you go again, Billy.
Distrustin' a person who's tryin' to be decent to you.
Don't you realize that's your whole trouble?
Don't you see that's what's gotten you into all your fights?
You got more enemies than anybody in this part of the country.
How do you expect to get along with people... when you think every man who holds his hand out to you... has a knife behind his back?
Son, l...
I just don't know what's going to become of you.
Honest, I don't.
I didn't mean anything.
I'm sorry.
That's the spirit.
That's my boy.
Now give me those guns and clear out of here, before it's too late.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
But I've had these guns a long time.
I sure hate to let go of 'em.
I've been pretty patient with you.
Billy, my son... it's your duty to give them up.
You owe it to yourself.
You ought to start a new life today.
Those guns are the badge of your shame.
They represent everything you must leave behind you.
Don't you realize that?
Don't you understand... that if you're going to start all over again... your hands must be clean?
I guess you're right, Pat.
I never thought of it like that.
Thanks, Pat.
Billy, you don't know what this means to me.
You'll never forget this day.
Good-bye, Pat.
Why do you say that?
Why shouldn't I?
Why should you?
You ain't goin' anywhere.
I took the firing pins out of those guns.
Why you...
Nothing would make me happier than for you to keep coming.
Is that one of your own guns?
It sure looks like it.
How did you get it?
You dirty little cheat.
You switched those guns on me.
Of all the dirty, rotten tricks...
I didn't mean to, Pat.
Honest, I didn't.
They must've gotten mixed up while I was playin' with 'em.
Thanks.
I left my guns right there.
What for?
Don't you have to show them to everybody to make them believe your story?
You see, I have an idea... that you'd rather give Doc the credit for doing you up like this.
Because I think you'd rather be dead than have people know... that Billy the Kid did this to ya.
Good-bye, Pat.
You don't wanna go off without your canteens, do you?
- Did you fill 'em up for me?
- Yes.
Oh, Simson, thank you for keeping open so late to take care of us.
Oh, that's quite all right, sir.
This gun is an excellent selection, Mr. Holmes.
You ought to get plenty of grouse.
Grouse are little birds, not worth the trouble of eating after you shoot them.
You wait till you hook into your first salmon, old boy.
Well, mind you have everything at Baker Street first thing in the morning, Simson, because if we're not in Scotland by the time the salmon stop running, the fish will hold
Dr. Watson personally responsible.
I'll have everything at your rooms first thing in the morning.
Thank you.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Aw, Scotland.
I shall be glad to get away from this place.
The smell of heaven after the rain, the crisp night air with the stars shining clear in the sky.
A day in the bush with stars to see, were I dip in the river.
There's the life of a man like me, there's the life forever.
Huh?
Robert Louis Stevenson.
You heard that rhyme before?
Yes, and many other lovely irons, too, Watson.
Uh-oh.
Oh, so the old girl has lost her emeralds, eh?
Now, Holmes, you promised, no more cases till our holiday's over.
Don't worry, old fellow,
I was just thinking she was well rid of her emeralds.
Green was never a becoming color to the old trout.
I say, you've dropped your paper, sir.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
No mistake,
I saw you drop it.
You've just been told, sir, that you made a mistake.
But it is the gentleman's paper, sir.
Be off with you, my good man.
Mr. Holmes told you that he didn't have a paper.
Yes, but I was quite wrong, I'm so sorry, that is my paper.
There are times, Holmes, when your behavior is utterly inexplicable.
Oh.
I'm sorry sir.
May I recommend a visit, gentlemen?
A visit where, sir?
The best fish and chips in London.
Fish and chips?
I never eat fish and chips.
My friend doesn't eat fish and chips.
We loathe fish and chips.
Come to think of it old fellow, some fish and chips might go very well just now.
Thank you for your suggestion, sir.
Come on, Watson.
Fish and chips, filthy stuff,
I wouldn't give it to my cat.
Hello, duckie.
Ah, good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening.
May I suggest that, sir?
No, I think I'll have some fish and chips.
And you, sir?
Just a minute, sorry.
We serve the best fish and chips in London, sir.
Make it two, will you?
I think I'll have an order of... gone?
I ordered for both of us.
What'd you order for me?
Fish and chips.
Fish and chips, nice place you brought me to, I must say.
I say, take a look at this fish bone.
Where?
Right in my soup.
A fine thing, it might have stuck in my throat.
Just a moment.
Fish bones.
I'd rather eat in an alley.
Go on and eat in an alley, then.
That's where you probably belong.
Likely as not we'll both be poisoned.
What's up, Holmes?
I don't know yet, but something definitely is.
Thank you.
Fish bones.
Fellow probably was right.
Looks like something one might find in an alley.
That's it.
What's it?
Fishbone Alley, of course.
What's the price got to do with it?
It's not the price, it's the numerals, 2, 6, number 26, Fishbone Alley.
Everything these last few minutes has been directed towards giving us that address.
Oh, come, Holmes, who on earth would go to all that troub...
Shhh.
The Duchess photograph,
Duchess Brookdale's house,
Barkley Square.
About 8:00 o'clock last...
I've got it,
8:00 o'clock.
But you said you weren't interested in the old trout's emeralds.
I'm not.
Well?
I've just been invited rather surreptitiously.
I meant to appear at
Number 26 Fishbone Alley at 8:00 o'clock tonight.
Mumbo jumbo if you ask me, probably no such place as Fishbone Alley.
Oh, yes, there is; it's off Mount Street.
7:45, we've just got time if we walk briskly.
Good night, duckie.
Look here Holmes, you're not thinking of going there, are you?
Naturally, someone must want to see us rather badly if they've gone to all that trouble.
But hang on; it may be a trap!
Well, if it is, at least it promises to be interesting one.
Sinister looking place.
See that?
They're expecting us.
Look out Holmes, be careful.
Won't you go in, gentlemen?
Thank you.
Please forgive the somewhat odd way in which we've summoned you, Mr. Holmes.
I admit, it was ingenious.
I'm sure you must have a reason.
Briefly, we wish to engage your services to take someone from England and deliver him to a place we shall designate.
And the name of this person?
That I'm not at liberty to divulge.
Gentlemen,
I'm not accustomed to working in the dark,
I bid you goodnight.
Mr. Holmes, one moment, please.
We are prepared to pay any sum you name, Mr. Holmes.
I assure you this is a matter of international importance.
My dear sir,
I realized that, when I encounter the
Prime Minister of Rovenia lurking outside an oyster bar in Soho apparently for the sole purpose of stimulating my appetite for fish and chips!
You deserve your reputation, sir.
I take it that you brought me here on a matter pertaining to the death of His
Majesty King Stefan in an automobile accident last week.
His Majesty was not killed in an automobile accident, Mr. Holmes, he was assassinated.
It's a great loss to the whole democratic world.
Won't you sit down, Mr. Holmes.
Thank you.
Permit me, gentlemen, to introduce my colleagues,
Anton Petzfall and
Matias Churney.
How do you do?
My associate Dr. Watson?
How do you do, gentlemen?
How do you do.
Mr. Holmes?
Thank you.
Dr. Watson?
Thank you.
A glass of wine, gentlemen?
No, thank you.
For several years now, a powerful group has been seeking to gain control of Rovenia for personal gain.
The assassination of His Majesty was their first step in that direction.
It is to prevent the second step that we have sent for you.
For the sake of our people, it is imperative that
King Stephan's son Nikolas be returned safely to his country.
Is he here in England?
Oh, yes.
His Majesty has been educated at one of your public schools.
A wise move, sir, very sound.
Do you feel that you yourselves are unequal to your task?
We're up against a clever and ruthless group to whom we are all well known.
Are they aware of His
Majesty's identity?
No, no one knows but ourselves.
His Majesty was brought to England as a child incognito.
Do you have any plans for his return to Rovenia?
We have a plane in
Retinues to leave tonight.
However, several steps will be necessary on route, and at any one of these stops
His Majesty's life may be attempted.
Mr. Holmes, for the sake not only of our country, but for liberty and good government everywhere, we implore you to undertake this mission.
Well, now, Holmes, you've given us your promise.
You need a rest, you know, you've not been up the mark lately.
I'm afraid we'll have to postpone our holiday, Watson.
But think of your health?
Sorry, old fellow.
Gentlemen, in the interest of democratic government,
I shall be happy to do my utmost to see that His Majesty reaches Rovenia in safety.
We thank you, Mr. Holmes.
Now, if we are to leave tonight, time is short and there are certain precautionary measures that I should like to discuss with you.
Watson, now, come along.
Will you excuse us?
Come along, old chap.
I suggest that you return to Baker Street, pack a bag and have a car ready to take us to the plane.
Holmes, I don't like the whole business.
Now don't get lost, goodnight
Now, gentlemen, may I have your attention?
Certainly a forsaken spot for an airfield.
Certainly is.
I feel like one of the
Babes in the Woods.
Lookout Holmes, who's that?
I imagine we've reached our destination.
Everything is ready, Mr. Holmes.
Follow me.
Your Highness, may I present
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?
How do you do, sir?
And Dr. Watson.
How do you do, sir?
Delighted to meet you gentlemen.
I appreciate your kindness in undertaking this mission.
Not at all, sir.
I am sorry, Dr. Watson, but I am afraid you will not be able to accompany
Mr. Holmes after all.
The plane we had expected to use developed engine trouble, and this as you see is only a three-seater.
Well, just a minute, sir.
Where Holmes goes, I go, too.
Well, I know, I know, but.
Well, first we lose our holiday, now this.
I don't like your going off alone, Holmes,
I don't like it at all.
Come, now, Watson, whatever we must do in a good cause must be done.
Look here, Rovenia isn't very far from the Mediterranean and it has some excellent fishing.
Why don't you take a boat, I'll meet you there.
We'll have our holiday after all?
Come to think of it, there's a boat sailing for the
Mediterranean tomorrow, the Friesland,
Swedish African line, cargo and passenger.
I have some influence with the directors.
Well, that's very kind of you, sir.
It's not just that I mind giving up our fishing,
Holmes, you know that, but hang it all,
I want to be of some use.
And you can be, definitely.
I can be?
Would you excuse us, sir?
Watson,
I don't like this convenient accident.
Too many people seem to be in on this secret.
When our antagonists discover we've separated, it's more than likely you'll be followed, so I want you to make yourself as conspicuous as possible.
Decoy, eh?
Sort of sitting duck.
That's right old fellow, be on your guard constantly.
Be wary of strangers, and whatever you do, don't breathe a word regarding my whereabouts.
Don't you worry, Holmes, you can trust me.
I know I can.
So long, old fellow.
We must hurry, Mr. Holmes.
I don't like it.
My name's
Watson, Dr. Watson.
Oh, yes, Dr. Watson.
I'm very glad to have you on board, sir.
My name is
Johansson, Purser.
Good morning.
Will you take
Dr. Watson's bag up to Cabin 8, please?
Yes, sir.
Sanford will be your steward.
Good, good.
Have you a cabin trunk, sir?
Naturally, one doesn't go to the Mediterranean without a change of linen.
Quite so, sir.
Be careful of those fishing poles, young fellow.
There you go, sir.
Your cabin is very comfortably located on the port side of the ship sir.
Good, I hope I have a nice reading...
Excuse me.
Purser, has anybody been asking for me?
Why, no, Ms. Woodbury, not as far as I know.
Oh, may I introduce
Dr. Watson, Ms. Woodbury.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Ms. Woodbury's quite a singer, you know.
She will be with us all the way to Alexandria.
Splendid, I used to sing a bit myself,
Sounds Like
Glacoloma and some.
Pardon me, sir, you're wanted in the lounge.
Excuse me.
Certainly.
You must sing it to me sometime.
Ha, ha, ha.
Is this your first trip to the East, Ms. Woodbury?
Yes, and I'm tickled to death.
American?
Brooklyn.
Brooklyn.
Yes, Brooklyn.
I've been wondering, are you the Dr. Watson?
Well, I'm Dr. Watson of 221 B, Baker Street.
The one who is associated with Sherlock Holmes?
Holmes and I have been associated on quite a number of cases.
Is Mr. Holmes with you on this trip?
No, as a matter of fact, he's gone...
Gone where?
Oh, he won't be long with us, he's a very busy man... he realized... he came to see me off to the station, he said, Watson, I shall be lost without you.
Oh, I'm so sorry he isn't here.
You see, I've heard so much about his work, and yours.
Oh, perhaps someday you'll let me give you an insight on some of our most interesting cases.
Oh, Reggie,
Who?
Oh, excuse me.
Reggie?
I was afraid you wouldn't get here in time to see me off.
Here you are, Sheila, and try not to lose it again.
Heavens, where was it!
I thought it was in my cabin.
You left it in my office yesterday.
Now try to hold onto it.
I don't imagine it'd be very easy to replace those arrangements in Alexandria.
You can forget your music more often than any singer I've ever managed.
I should have a secretary.
All ashore!
All visitors ashore!
That might be a slight hint.
Oh, you'll find Hassan a nice chap to work for.
I hope I make good.
You will, good luck.
Thank you.
And don't lose it again.
Oh, don't worry,
I won't let it out of my sight this time.
Sorry, sir, you'll have to go ashore now.
Goodbye, Reggie.
I make it a rule to take a three-mile hike before each meal.
Keeps one fit, stimulates the digestion.
That and a glass of milk.
As I was saying, she was in wonderful voice.
I shall never forget that last night at the old Adolto.
Pull down now to make way for a cinema.
Heartbreaking.
Where would we be without the cow, Doctor?
The cow?
I haven't the faintest idea.
I'm sure Mr. Arnold here would be happy to help me in organizing deck games, shuffleboard, deck tennis, medicine ball, hiking.
Should I put you down for the three-mile hike before lunch, Dr. Watson?
No, thank you very much.
I prefer to sit down before my meals.
Relax and have a glass of sherry.
Like Ferdinand the Bull.
I am on a holiday.
How does that little tune go?
Let me see, I'll think of it in a minute.
Incorrigible.
I have it...
(Singing melody)
Ha, ha, that's it.
Should I'll put you down for the three-mile hike before each meal?
Yours?
Thank you yes, there's a bag goes with it.
Thank you.
Oh, lunch.
There's nothing like salt air to give one an appetite.
Don't you agree,
Mr. Arnold?
So long, duckie, see you later.
Aren't you coming,
Dr. Watson?
No, my dear,
I'll join you later.
All right.
What would Holmes do?
I said sherry, Steward.
Carrying a revolver, very suspicious.
And I tell you, so long as no one on the boat knows of our mission...
Things can't be kept quiet indefinitely.
Certain factions are still fanatically loyal to their royal line, you know.
For enough money the people will forget there ever was such a King.
And once we have the body... shh.
Doctor?
Small gray plane, two white stripes.
No!
It can't be true!
Holmes,
Holmes gone!
Dr. Watson?
I beg your pardon,
Dr. Watson?
What is it?
I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but there's a gentleman quite ill in Cabin 7.
The captain asked if you'd mind seeing him.
No, no, I can't see anyone now.
Well, we have no doctor aboard, sir.
I've retired from practice.
Well, the captain requested it, sir.
The captain?
Oh, where is he?
If you'll just follow me.
It's the cabin adjoining yours, sir.
Right this way, sir.
The doctor is here, sir.
Is it serious, doctor?
Oh, dear, dear, dear, can't you see I'm busy?
Thank you, Sanford.
Holmes!
But the wireless said your plane crashed!
No survivors!
It was shot down, Watson.
I don't understand.
I'm terribly sorry, old fellow.
I meant you to know the truth at the earliest possible moment, but as you know,
I have a dislike of plans made by other people.
They have a habit of becoming too widely known, and that convenient accident of the original plane merely confirmed my suspicion.
You mean you intended to take the boat all along?
Certainly,
I made the arrangements with the Prime Minister while you were at
Baker Street packing.
Well, why didn't you tell me?
Why let me make a fool of myself?
You didn't make a fool of yourself.
No one could possibly have known from your manner in coming aboard that our young friend here and I were lying hidden below until the ship sailed.
Your Majesty!
You mean, your nephew,
Nikolas Watson.
What?
Oh, yes, yes, of course, yes, yes, of course.
That's my nephew, Nikolas.
As I suspected, old fellow, our enemies acted promptly and ruthlessly and it's only a matter of time until they find the wreckage of the plane and discover that we're not on it.
Well, let me explain something, Holmes.
There's a woman on board who carries a revolver in her handbag.
She calls herself Dunham,
Miss Agatha Dunham.
If she's a she.
From the looks of it,
I wouldn't be surprised if it's a man dressed up.
Oh, it's not very uncommon for a woman traveling alone to carry a revolver.
Yes, but there's another thing, Holmes.
I just heard a very suspicious conversation between two men in the smoking room.
Something about a fanatical faction and a body of a king.
Oh, hmm.
I had hoped my strategy might give us breathing space for a day or two.
What do you propose to do, Holmes?
I... I've made arrangements to hand
Nikolas over to his friends in Algiers, the ships first stop.
They have the means to ensure the completion of his journey and safety.
After which you and Dr. Watson will be able to continue with your interrupted holiday.
After which we shall both need some relaxation.
From the look of it, old fellow, you've already started.
What do you mean, Holmes?
Along the lines of relaxation, I mean.
Brunette, young, beautiful.
As a matter of fact you're right, but how did you know?
Brunette.
And I pay sufficient credit to your good taste, to take the beautiful for granted.
Now, if a girl and boy should meet, would you think it indiscrete if they had a friendly chat.
I'm sure you'd find there isn't any harm in that.
If they met again at 4:00, had a cup of tea or more, then he said he liked your hat,
I'm sure you'd find there isn't any harm in that.
He holds your hand, he thinks you're grand, love takes command.
Before he's through, it's I love you.
Now, if the girl should lose her head and the boy and girl should wed, and they take a furnished flat, so what?
That's great, there isn't any harm in that.
Ha, ha, ha, delightful, very delightful.
Now, how about that surprise you said you had for me?
Oh, you'll see in time.
But first of all you must keep your promise.
You said you'd sing, "Flow Gently
Sweet Afton" for me.
Oh, all right, if you really want me too.
Oh, of course I do.
I wonder if you'd hand me my music case, please?
Oh, here it is.
So sorry.
That's all right.
Hope I didn't hurt you.
No, no.
Ah, here is my surprise.
May I introduce my nephew,
Mr. Nikolas Watson?
How do you do?
How do you do?
And my friend,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
How do you do?
Oh, I... excuse me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Really, Watson,
I've never thought of myself as handsome, but that's the first time in my life that a woman has run away at the sight of me.
Hang on Holmes, something must be wrong.
Obviously, can we have a sherry?
Please.
No, thanks.
Did you tell her
I was on board?
No, no, I just told her tonight that I had a surprise for her.
That seems to be rather an understatement.
Two sherries, please.
Yes, sir.
I don't understand it, Holmes.
She seems too nice a girl.
She sings charmingly.
My dear fellow, musical talent is hardly evidence of innocence.
As a matter of fact, the late Professor Moriarity was a virtuoso on the bassoon.
Thank you.
Incidentally, under no circumstances is Nikolas to be left alone, at any time or for any reason.
Oh, what are you going to do, Holmes?
Nothing.
I shall leave the first move to my antagonists.
Cheers.
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, my dear.
Not that it is a very good morning.
Well, at least it's mysterious and attractive, not all dirty and sinister like a London fog.
Blasted noise, kept me awake half the night.
Oh, that's too bad.
Would you be interested in a stroll around the deck?
I'd like to.
Well, come along, then.
Watson, I think a walk on the deck, is indicated.
Not for me.
Oh yes of course, nothing like a good hike for indigestion.
That's funny, they can't have gone far.
Can't see a thing.
I don't dare entrust a message like that to the wireless, it might fall into the wrong hands.
Well, unless we should get in touch with someone in authority at once.
I do know there should be three bodies, not just one.
We were told to use our own judgment about the best way to...
Pardon me, gentlemen, have you by any chance seen Ms. Woodbury and...
Sorry, we haven't.
That's very rude.
Nikolas?
Nikolas?
Good morning, duckie.
Good morning, you're looking depressingly healthy.
Rather.
Three-mile hike before each meal, old boy.
I know, good for the digestion.
You haven't by any chance seen
Ms. Woodbury and my nephew, have you?
Don't tell me you've lost the dear boy.
The question is not have
I lost the dear boy, but have you seen him?
Come, doctor a-hunting we will go.
I've already been this way.
You know, there's something fascinating about fog at sea.
Gets you just as wet.
It really is thick, isn't it?
You can hardly see the water.
It looks ominous.
Yes, doesn't it?
You're right about it being wet.
You know, I have a feeling my nose is a sight.
It's a very pretty nose.
Oh, liar!
Look out!
Oh, well, thank you, I... isn't it lucky you were here?
Yes, isn't it?
You, you startled me.
I thought you were deep in your chess game.
Oh, the lust is found, Doctor.
Sorry, Holmes, it was a fog.
Yes, so I observed.
It's colder out here than I thought.
Come, my dear, a good brisk hike will do you good.
I'm sure the Doctor doesn't wish to continue now that he's found the dear boy.
It appears that someone has been careless, Watson.
'Cross my heart,
I always will love you, put nothing above you, cross my heart.
Cross my heart,
I'll hold you forever.
I promise we never will part.
With you the trees in winter will look green to me.
What you will mean to me can never be torn.
Cross my heart, your vision will guide me, deep down here inside me'
What's up?
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me, will you?
Nikolas?
Something wrong?
Excuse me, please.
We're off Lisbon.
Lisbon?
We're not supposed to stop there, are we?
I rather fancied we'd be getting some unexpected passengers about now.
Yes, I think added caution is indicated.
In the last 24 hours they've undoubtedly discovered that we're not on that plane and we are on this ship.
Those fellows
Kingston and Jerry were outside the wireless room today.
They said something about communicating with someone in authority.
Could they...?
Possibly.
Nikolas, Dr. Watson and
I are going on deck again.
I'm rather anxious to see who's coming aboard.
Lock the door, will you, and don't open it except for Dr. Watson or myself.
Going on deck, sir?
Yes, breath of fresh air.
I see, sir.
Holmes, did it occur to you that Stewart behaved rather suspiciously?
Quite.
I understand we stopped to take on some cargo.
Yes, three passengers.
Oh, Mr. Holmes, you startled me.
Well, you see three men have come aboard.
It's what Ms. Woodbury just informed us.
Lisbon, beautiful city.
Too bad we shan't have a chance to pay it a visit.
(unintelligible),
(unintelligible).
One of the most fascinating examples of Moorish architecture
I've ever seen.
Good evening.
Mr. Holmes, is it not?
Good evening.
I'm afraid you have the advantage of me.
Oh, that's the price of fame, Mr. Holmes.
Who on earth's that?
I don't know.
I've seen his face before somewhere.
Mirko!
I think, Watson, we'd better get back to your nephew.
This way, it's quicker.
Who's there?
It's I, Holmes.
Nikolas, I want you to move in with Dr. Watson until we reach our destination, understand?
Certainly Mr. Holmes.
I should think you'd want to keep him under your eye?
I would if it weren't for that
I think Nikolas will be safer in an inside cabin.
A porthole looking onto the promenade deck is apt to offer too many temptations to the three gentlemen in the cabin opposite ours, or anyone else who might be interested.
(Knock on door)
Yes?
Is there anything you require before retiring, sir?
Nothing, thank you,
Sanford, good night.
Good night, sir.
Holmes, I... I don't trust that fellow.
Yes?
Oh, good morning, Sanford.
Good morning, sir.
Put that down over there, will you.
Breakfast will be served in half an hour.
Coffee.
I don't see how you can drink the stuff.
I never could stand it myself.
Everyone in my country drinks coffee.
My dear Nikolas, apparently you don't realize that it's tea that has made the British Empire and Watson what they are today.
Well, we're both in pretty good shape, aren't we?
I thought it was the playing fields of Eaton that were responsible.
No, no, no, it was the
Battle of Waterloo.
Crummy looking stuff, even for coffee.
Looks as if the cream had gone sour.
Don't drink it!
Why not?
What's wrong?
Mm, it's fortunate that you take cream with your coffee, Nikolas.
I... I don't understand!
It happens to be an idiosyncrasy of the cyanic acid group it breaks up fat in the globules.
Cyanic acid?
Do you mean to say that Nikolas was almost poisoned before our very eyes?
If it hadn't been for the telltale appearance of the cream...
Cold-blooded murder!
Men who have engineered one assassination, Watson, will not stop at another.
I owe you my life, Mr. Holmes.
No, not me, Dr. Watson, with his keen sense of observation.
Oh, thank you, Holmes.
Has it occurred to you that Steward chap was the only one who knows that you and I take tea and he takes coffee?
You don't suppose
Sheila...?
Possibly, poison is a woman's weapon.
A woman's weapon.
They might include that Dunham woman if she's a woman.
Mm-hmm.
Mustn't overlook that little bearded fellow and his goggle-eyed friend.
And don't forget the three charming gentlemen who came aboard last night.
Good shot, Watson!
Oh, thanks old boy.
Was lucky, Dr. Watson.
Not luck, skill,
Mr. Merner.
Mirko if you don't mind, M-i-r-k-o.
Oh, sorry, old bean.
Your turn, Mr. Holmes.
You've um, you've left your man unguarded.
I don't think so.
It will be more difficult to take him off than it appears.
Your turn, Mr. Gregor.
Oh, tough luck, partner.
Unfortunate.
And yet sometimes to leave a man unguarded may be a skillful trap for one's opponents.
You flatter me Mr. Gregor.
I'm not as clever a player as that.
You're too modest,
Mr. Holmes.
Mirko is most accurate.
I'm afraid I'm not giving him much help.
Are you conceding defeat then, Mr. Holmes?
Oh, certainly not.
One always prefers to win.
Even when the price of victory is too high?
I guess that all depends on the price one's willing to pay.
Well, that's it, Mr. Mirko.
I'm afraid we're too good for you, old man.
Yes, Mr. Holmes and I, shall have to send the drinks.
After your skillful playing Mr. Mirko,
I wouldn't think of penalizing you.
The drinks shall be on me.
You are a good loser, Mr. Holmes.
I suggest we all meet in the lounge after dinner.
Thank you for the game, gentlemen.
Pleasure was ours, Mr. Holmes.
Oh, now we can really see it.
The Rock of Gibraltar.
We'll be getting to the Mediterranean soon, Holmes.
Now that you have failed to warn Holmes off, our only safety lies in first eliminating him.
But Holmes is not our objective.
No, but he stands between us and our objective.
It seems such a pity to eliminate Sherlock Holmes.
You may accuse me of being unduly tenderhearted, but to destroy so great a man in order to reach our target...
But the target we must reach before we arrive at Algiers.
There's still plenty of time.
You're right, of course.
I should like to have given Holmes a chance, but...
Good.
Then tonight it'll be done my way.
You really enjoy your work, don't you, Mirko?
I promise you Mirko is more than competent.
We cannot afford to take chances.
And Nikolas must be disposed of before we reach Algiers.
That's because you don't know Mirko.
I've used him before, and I promise you, he never fails.
Because your strong-arm methods are apt to be too noisy.
With Mirko it's swift and silent.
Understand?
Satisfied?
I'm sure Mr. Gubeck is convinced.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening.
Mr. Mirko insists that losers pay off the bet.
We're delighted.
Won't you sit down?
What do you have?
A brandy for me.
Brandy.
Whisky and soda for me.
Whisky and soda and three brandies, please.
Pay nothing for losing the game.
No ice in mine, Steward.
I can't think why you ruin good whiskey by putting ice in it.
You see, Mr. Holmes, losing the game always carries a penalty, sometimes greater than others.
Well, if one isn't willing to pay the penalty, one shouldn't play the game.
Thank you.
Your health, and long life.
Thank you.
I think I'll turn in now.
Oh, what happened to your charming companion?
She said she had a headache and went to her cabin.
I think it's time we all turned in.
Gentlemen, I bid you goodnight.
Twenty past 10:00, it's a good idea.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, gentlemen.
Sit down.
There's no hurry.
My dear Mirko, time to cultivate patience.
It's so much safer.
He turned out the light.
I promise you
I shall not fail.
Agh!
Oh, how unfortunate,
Mr. Mirko.
These porthole covers are notoriously treacherous.
I'm afraid you've broken your wrist!
You, you pig!
You shouldn't have played shuffleboard today, you know.
When I saw that skillful hand and unerringly accurate eye of yours,
I remembered the Circus of Medlano, in Paris, and your amazing exhibition of Knife throwing.
Goodnight.
Oh, good morning,
Mr. Holmes.
Oh, there you are.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Gregor.
I heard of your friend's unfortunate accident.
Will you please convey my sympathy?
It may take a long time to heal.
You have to have patience, you know.
I was explaining the advantage of patience to Mr. Mirko only last night.
Now me, I am a very patient man myself, and I always believe the result well worth waiting for, don't you agree, Mr. Holmes?
Patience has advantages under certain conditions.
We are in accord,
Mr. Holmes.
Yes, aren't we!
That fellow Mirko said he slipped and fell down while walking around the deck at 3:00 o'clock in the morning.
Drunk most, probably.
Possibly.
He's got a nasty fracture.
Took me over an hour to set.
I've got no sleep again.
Most regrettable, too bad you couldn't blame it on your insomnia.
Insomnia?
You know I always sleep like a top.
Well, I don't think either of us is going to get much sleep tonight.
Oh, you mean that woman's party?
Silly creature!
What on earth does she want to give a party for?
It wasn't referring to Mrs. Dunhams' party, Watson, deadly, as that will undoubtedly be.
No, this is the last opportunity our three friends will have to prevent our successfully carrying out our mission.
We arrive at
Algiers late tonight.
Good morning, my dear.
I should say the young lady isn't looking forward to arriving in Algiers with any real great pleasure.
Do you notice, Watson, she hasn't let her music case out of her sight since our first meeting?
Well, now that you mention it, yes.
I want you to ask her to sing,
"Flow Gently Sweet Afton."
And if she makes an excuse, ask her if the music is in that case, leave the rest to me.
You will see an interesting reaction.
I'll do it right now.
I still haven't heard
"Flow Gently Sweet Afton".
You promised to sing it for me, you know.
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm afraid I don't know it from memory.
No, no, no, I won't take no for an answer.
You put the music for it here in your case.
I'm afraid I don't feel like singing.
I beg your pardon?
What did I tell you.
Interesting, isn't it?
Interesting.
By Jove he's right.
Don't come any nearer.
If you do, I'll...
I won't come any nearer, I promise.
But may I talk to you?
My dear Sheila.
I don't know yet just what you're in such mortal terror of, but I'm sure that whatever it is, you are an innocent victim.
I don't know what you're talking.
Well, to begin with, the way you acted the first time you saw me was a bit of a blow to my vanity, you know.
Men are such vain creatures, aren't they?
So I prefer to think that it was something unexpected that you found in your music case that caused you to react in such fashion.
I saw nothing.
Oh, come now, you must have.
And so since the quickest way to relieve fear is to share the cause of it with someone else, please forgive me if
I attempt to find out just what it is that your music case contains.
But I told you...
Wait a minute.
Come along, won't you.
Please.
Won't you sit down, please?
Now, it's unlikely to be important documents, since to know their significance you'd do need a time to examine them.
But there is one thing which is small enough to be easily concealed and which is highly valuable, a jewel or jewels.
Then... then there's this fellow Hassan in whose café you've been engaged as an entertainer.
He's been suspected for years by the police of two continents as the largest receiver of stolen goods in the Near East.
So circumstances would indicate the jewels you found in your music case are both stolen and extremely valuable.
And since there have been no other important robberies in London for some considerable time,
I venture to say that you're carrying the Duchess
Brookdales' emeralds.
Am I right?
You're quite right, Mr. Holmes.
May I?
I left the briefcase in my manager's office.
He brought it to me just before we sailed.
Yes, so Dr. Watson informed me.
I recognized the emeralds from the newspaper description.
Oh, Mr. Holmes, I've been so frightened.
Don't worry, my dear.
Don't worry.
I'll return the necklace.
And I assure that the reward the insurance company has offered is yours and will more than make up to you for any loss you may incur by the cancellation of the Hassan contract, and will enable you to go home to...
Brooklyn.
Brooklyn.
Well, I knew a most charming man who lived there once.
He's now a resident in Sing-Sing prison.
You know, I'm not going to have to carry this briefcase around with me any more.
How can I ever thank you?
If you really must thank me, please do so by singing
Dr. Watson's song for him, will you?
You're a darling.
Extraordinary sight.
Elementary my dear fellow, and very pleasant.
Flow gently Sweet Afton, among thy green braes.
Flow gently, I sing thee a song in thy praise.
My Mary's asleep by the murmuring stream.
Flow, gently Sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.
Good evening.
Oh, that looks very nice, Steward.
May I help you?
No, I want to put these favors around myself.
I want to rearrange the seating.
See, I'm using them as place cards.
And I put the name on each.
That nice, fat gentleman, it was his suggestion.
Hope nothing goes wrong.
Nothing will go wrong this time, my dear Mirko.
Thank you, that was charming.
I love that old song.
Now you must sing for me Doctor, you promised you know.
Well, if you like.
I haven't sung for some time.
There's nobody here.
Remember, you told me you used to sing a song of...
What was it, Loch Lomond?
Yes.
C'mon now, Doctor, just to please me.
By young bonnie banks and by young bonnie braes
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond.
Where...
Nikolas?
Dr. Watson.
And this is me.
There, I think that's done.
Now, I'm going to have a few words with the chef to make sure everything's taken care of.
May I show you the way?
Thank you.
Hardly any difference.
But me and my true love, we'll never meet again on the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.
Bravo, Watson, bravo.
I look forward to seeing you at the Opera Hall.
I didn't know you were there.
Seems my voice is a bit rusty.
You're just being modest, Dr. Watson, it was delightful.
Eh, Childre?
Oh, delightful.
My dear Kingston, why would they have constructed it so large if it were not to accommodate city...
Watson, have you met
Mr. Kingston and Mr. Childre?
I've seen them about.
Mr. Kingston and Mr. Childre are archaeologists.
They're going to Egypt to excavate a tomb.
And we've just received a wireless that the
British government...
Egyptian.
Egyptian government has granted its permission.
Congratulations.
Archaeologists, they might have been dug up themselves.
Watson, please.
Was that you singing, duckie?
I could hear you in the galley.
Really, it was.
What was it.
Well, it was...
Well, is everybody ready?
The best in board awaits.
We'll have a wonderful time, duckie.
It seems that we have rearranged the seating order.
See, duckie, you're this end, next to me.
I'm not going to let you off, you know.
Let me off what?
This is our last night together, and you've been promising the whole voyage to tell me about one of
Sherlock Holmes' adventures.
Please do.
Oh, isn't it a little early?
No.
Hadn't we ought to wait till after dinner?
Well, why not start now?
All right, now, well, let's see.
Did any of you ever hear of the Giant Rat of Sumatra?
No, but it sounds terribly gruesome.
It certainly was, it never got in the papers at the time, too delicate a matter.
I don't suppose it'll do any harm to do it now.
It all began one evening in Baker Street.
Holmes and I were sitting in our rooms when suddenly the door opened slowly, and in walked...
Sit down, you're quite safe here.
I don't like the suspense.
My dear Mirko, as I have said before, patience is an admirable quality.
You should cultivate it.
- One of the old pea soupers... they're rare these... now, I hope you all understand the topography of the place.
It's important, devilishly important.
Now, let's see if
I can get it straight.
Between these two knives is the Thames.
That's right, it's the Thames.
And the curette is the warehouse.
The warehouse, that's right.
This boat is the salsa.
No, this salsa is a boat, of course.
No, no, no, the salsa is the boat.
Come on, Sheila, where's your hat?
Oh, I'm sorry,
I was listening to your uncle's story.
Here.
Oh, dear, nothing happened.
Here, take mine.
Oh, oh, no, you don't.
No, this time I'm not taking any chances,
I'm going to do it all myself.
Wait a minute.
I don't think there's a hat in that one.
Why don't you take mine.
I never wear paper hats.
Oh, well, thank you, Mr. Holmes.
But I'm sorry you won't wear it yourself,
I'm sure it'd be very becoming.
As I was saying,
Holmes and I crept down the alley between the sinister looking warehouses.
This stalk of celery is Holmes and this bit of cheese is me.
Oh, duckie.
But when we reach the end of the alley, it was a black wall, so we had to retrace our steps.
There was nothing else to do.
Was it a high wall?
High, it was about six foot high.
I tried to climb it,
I said to Holmes it was absolutely ludicrous, so he said to me,
Watson, there's nothing else for it, and back we turned.
Something has gone wrong.
They've been down there.
Be quiet.
It's that
Holmes I tell you.
We should have got rid of him.
Good evening, Mr. Holmes.
Good evening.
Party over so soon?
No, I don't think so.
I imagine the festivities are in full swing.
I just don't happen to be much of a hand at small talk and paper hats.
Oh, that's too bad.
Now me, I always enjoy that sort of thing.
Really?
Then perhaps you'd like a paper hat as a souvenir.
This one was at
Watson's nephew's place.
I'm sure he'd like you to have it.
Not interested?
Oh, very well.
That's curious.
Good evening, Mr. Mirko.
Nothing will go wrong, this time, my dear Mirko.
And after a desperate chase up the river and the police launched the start, finally apprehended the soft wappee... the freighter was thrown out to see and blown up.
And London, all England for that matter, was saved from the terrible menace of the
Giant Rat of Sumatra.
Oh, thank you very much.
I don't think
I left anything out, did I, Holmes?
I beg your pardon.
You're not listening very closely?
I asked you if
I omitted anything.
I don't think so.
Nothing ever escapes your eagle eye.
Oh, really, thanks a lot.
Oh, here's my soup at last.
Getting hungry.
Cheerio.
Hi.
I can't believe this is our last night.
It's funny,
I can't, either.
Archeologists, going about like a couple of conspirators.
You notice, Watson, that our three friends are conspicuous by their absence?
Oh, now that you mentioned it,
I don't see them anywhere about.
Hello, we stopped.
Yes, we're off
Algiers at last.
Thank heavens for that.
We haven't yet delivered
His Majesty in safety.
I'm afraid I'll have to take Nikolas away.
So early?
But nobody's getting off the board until morning.
I'm sorry, I have a lot of packing to do.
Oh, I see.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Are you having a good time?
Oh, yes, he's wonderful.
Eh?
Oh, yes, it's been wonderful.
Ho, has it?
We can relax only when Nikolas is safely in the hands of his friends.
You remember the identification they'll present?
Yes, of course.
Good, get your hat and coat,
I'll stay here with
Nikolas until you return.
Yes?
The launch is waiting to take Dr. Watson ashore, sir.
Thank you, Sanford.
Good luck, old fellow, and hurry.
You can rely on me, Holmes.
Bye, Nikolas.
Good luck.
How long should it take him, Mr. Holmes?
Oh, about half an hour, I should think.
No one could say it's not been an exciting trip.
That's to be expected.
We would have all have died of boredom if it hadn't been.
(Knock on door)
Yes.
Sorry, Holmes,
I forgot my pipe.
Don't do anything foolish, Mr. Holmes.
I dare say you're surprised to see me, aren't you?
In a way, yes.
Impersonations are a hobby of mine.
After Dr. Watson left the cabin,
I managed to simulate his voice at the door, which was quite good.
However, it was fortunate that you didn't hear it.
Yes, isn't it?
I think you must conceded, Mr. Holmes, that the last trick of the game is mine.
Ah!
Stupid!
Ah!
Our object now is not to kill Mr. Holmes, but to get the other one off the boat as quickly as possible!
That's better!
Come on.
I must offer you our sincerest congratulations on the successful accomplishment of your so hazardous mission, Dr. Watson.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Levitz.
I don't mind admitting it was one of our most difficult cases.
Mr. Holmes is aboard the ship?
Indeed he is, I left him guarding His Majesty.
Our country owes you a great debt of gratitude, sir.
Oh, it was nothing at all, sir, nothing at all.
Follow me, gentlemen.
Holmes?
Holmes?
That's funny.
Holmes?
Holmes?
What on earth has happened?
Where's Nikolas?
Where is he?
Excuse me.
Did these gentlemen correctly identify themselves?
Yes, of course they have.
Never mind about that now.
Ring for the steward, will you, Watson?
Hmm?
Where's Nikolas?
What have you done with him?
Mr. Holmes, what has happened?
Dr. Watson assured us
His Majesty would be safe under your guard.
Look here, Holmes, there must be some explanation!
Gentlemen, I'm rather peeved at your evident lack of confidence in me.
Did you ring, sir?
Your Majesty,
King Nikolas!
You're safe, sir.
Heaven be praised!
What?
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, what's he talking about?
King Nikolas?
I don't understand.
And the young man who assumed your identity, sir?
He's safe and unharmed.
We just received word from the shore.
Three men have been taken by the Security Police.
But you let them tie you up and kidnap him.
Naturally, as ensuring their absence during His Majesty's safe arrival.
I can't thank you enough, Mr. Holmes.
Your Majesty's safe arrival is thanks enough for me.
And you, too, Dr. Watson.
We had best be starting without further delay.
Goodbye, Your Majesty.
Dr. Watson, and
I will not forget that we've had the unusual distinction of having our breakfast served to us in bed by a King.
Your Majesty.
Goodbye, gentlemen, thank you.
Goodbye, sir.
Why didn't you tell me?
Didn't you feel that you could trust me?
My dear fellow, you know I have the utmost confidence in you.
It certainly doesn't look as though you had.
My dear Watson, if you'd known the truth you'd never have been able to treat His Majesty as a steward.
Well, didn't you think that I could play up?
I was afraid that honest face of yours might give the secret away.
Yes, Watson, let me advise you.
If you ever consider taking up another profession, never even think of becoming an actor.

That's not me, folks.
I come on later. I play a coward.
Lower away. Steady, easy as she goes.
Fill her in and there she rests.
Three years of plunder on the high seas.
Enough gold and treasure to buy a continent.
And no one will ever know where it is but you, Captain.
- This map is the only key.
- Very good, Mr. Pelly.
- An excellent job of mapmaking.
- Thank you, sir.
- But just one thing, Mr. Pelly.
- Yes, sir?
What if, by some ill chance,
I should lose this map?
Would you be able to draw me another one from memory?
With my eyes closed, sir.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
Thank you, Mr. Pelly.
His eyes are closed, but I do not see him making another map... and the same fate will befall any other man Jack among you... whose memory is too good.
Back to the ship now, my lads.
We have business to attend.
- Hurry now.
- Where to now, Captain?
There is a packet called the Mary Ann out of Liverpool for Jamaica.
- We shall pay her a visit, Pedro, my lad.
- I know the Mary Ann well.
- She carries no gold.
- Right you are, Pedro.
But I am informed she has on board ajewel far more precious than gold.
- Ajewel with blue eyes and silken hair.
- You speak in riddles, Captain.
Perhaps, but I tell you, my lad, there lives a king... who'll pay a million doubloons to the one who returns this jewel to him.
But I know of no such jewel.
Good. When you know too much, you will follow Mr. Pelly.
Make haste, you blasted sons of unholy mothers.
We're off for the Mary Ann.
Anything on the horizon, Captain?
A ship flying friendly colors, but I can't make out her name.
- Hold your course.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Your pardon, Captain. Miss Warbrook says
Sylvester the Great is at it again.
She can stand it no longer.
She desires you to speak to him.
Very good. I'll attend to it at once.
Keep a weather eye on that ship.
- I'll be back shortly.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Yes? Come in.
Have you spoken to that imbecile in the next cabin?
Yes, but he's rather difficult to control.
I don't believe you'll be troubled any longer, Your Highness.
Captain, I must admonish you.
It's Miss Warbrook on this voyage.
It slips out, Princess. Miss Warbrook.
I'm worried, my lady.
Should the King discover that I assisted you in your flight...
You have been well-paid, and I assure you no harm will come to you.
- But, Your Highness...
- All I want is rest and privacy.
- Please see that I get it.
- As you wish.
No, do not kill him!
Do you not know he is your own father?
Father or no father, this cur shall die.
Perhaps my sword shall put an end to your vain boasting, Rodney Faversham.
Have it, you!
That this should happen to me.
I'm done for, I tell you.
Don't be frightened. I am rehearsing.
This sword doesn't really go through me.
I couldn't stand that five shows a day.
I'm ticklish. Pardon me.
I'm dying. Dying.
Death's rattle. I'm dead.
- I don't mean to intrude on your rehearsal.
- No, not at all.
Sit down and take a load off my eyes.
I always work better with an audience... especially when they don't outnumber me.
Wait, I'll take off this putty nose.
Fools everybody.
Look, I want to speak to you about all this noise...
It'll keep. Say, don't go away.
Here comes the high spot of my act.
There's no limit to what I can do.
That's not me. That's a cat.
It keeps coming here all the time.
Stage-struck, trying to get in the act.
Come on.
I've already got seven faces.
I don't need another puss. Ham.
Mr. Sylvester the Great, you've quite an act.
I'm sure you've worked hard at it, but...
I'm glad you appreciate it.
My act is known all over Europe.
That's why I'm going to America.
I am sure you'll get the reception you deserve.
Naturally. Say, here's a laugh for you.
You'll find this hard to believe... but there's a weasel next door that objects to my rehearsing.
Sends the Captain, telling me to pipe down. Hasn't got nerve to tell me himself.
The Captain doesn't seem to have much success, Sylvester.
- I see you haven't piped.
- No, I'm not going to. You know what I did.
I walked into the cabin, and busted him right in the snoot...
- and him with shoulders like that.
- Sylvester, I have news for you.
- I'm the weasel next door.
- Yeah. I told...
Please try the act in pantomime.
No, do not kill him!
Do you not know that he is your own father?
- What did you say?
- Nothing. I just said "um."
Guess I can say "um."
What do you know?
- What's that?
- Nothing. I just said, "What do you know."
Look at what they said about me in the Timbuktu Bugle.
Boy, what a write-up, even mentions my name.
- "Sylvester the Great attracts attention."
- That's enough.
"Of all the actors who ever played Timbuktu...
"Sylvester the Great is probably the worst..."
Here's another one from the Leningrad Tattler.
In Russian that's a great compliment.
It means that I'm a schlemiel.
Very few of us left.
You seem to have done quite a lot of traveling.
With an act like mine, it's safer. I've been to many places, the Indies, Europe, Africa.
Should've seen the show I did on the Road to Morocco.
- Were you good?
- I would have been sensational... only some overage crooner with laryngitis kept crabbing my act. I had to brush him.
You know, I've never met an actor before.
You stay away from them.
Most of them go right on the make for a girl.
You know, I got a proposition.
A dame with your wardrobe...
I might be able to use you in my act.
Sylvester, that's very generous of you, but I can't act.
That never stopped me. Besides, with your figure, you don't have to act.
You have to stand there in tights, holding a tray with the stuff for my different faces.
In fact, if we get the right tights,
I might not have to use so many faces.
Sail ho!
Ship closing in off the starboard bow!
All hands on deck!
- What is it, lunch hour?
- Man the gun stations!
- I don't like the looks of this.
- What?
I hear there are pirates in these waters.
Let them stay in the water.
They're dangerous on ships.
Do you know how to use these?
Do I know how to use these?
This is my racket.
What do you think
I wear them for, ornaments?
- The bullet comes out this end.
- Yeah. It must be an old model. Now watch.
Wrong pistol. That's for the silent pictures.
Wait a minute.
You see that seagull up there on the deckhouse?
Watch me shoot out its left eye.
Imagine what I could have done if this gun were loaded.
Out of the way, you leather-mugged ape!
Are we fighting or dancing the fandango?
See that flag?
You know what that skull and crossbones stands for, don't you?
Yeah, iodine, and we're going to need it.
- That's the Avenger, The Hook's ship.
- The Hook?
Yes. For 15 years he's sailed the seas, thirsting for blood.
He ain't gonna get a drink here.
Don't stand there. Get me a lifeboat.
He'll make me walk the plank.
I'll get my notices wet. Come on.
Fire!
Sylvester, I'm ashamed of you hiding behind me. Haven't you any backbone?
- Yeah, but it's nothing like yours.
- Get up. We must help fight them off.
- What are you, a man or a mouse?
- A man or a mouse. Why, I'm a...
Where's mama?
We'll run alongside. Lie flat until our bowsprit tangles her rigging...
- then board.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Get going, man.
What are you doing in this fight?
- I'm foreman.
- Here, take your stand by the mainmast.
You heard the Captain.
Take your stand at the mainmast.
Mainmast? I wouldn't know the mainmast if it fell on me.
I had to open my big mouth.
Fellas, excuse me.
All along the gangway!
Move lively. Lively now!
I'll bash your head in. Come on.
Pardon me. So hard to get coat hangers these days, I thought I'd use the hook.
The Hook!
Out of my way. I'll slit his gizzard.
Captain, the ship is ours.
The last gun has been spiked.
What further orders, sir?
Find the jewel that we seek and see that no harm comes to her.
- Spare all the women, but kill all the men!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Put 'em up, I tell you.
One false move and I'll let you have it.
You got it.
Curse you! I'll cut out your gizzard.
You'll dance to the devil's hornpipe at the end of the main yard!
I'll slit his gizzard! I'll cut him to ribbons!
Open that door, you sniveling idiot!
Plague and perish your ugly bones!
Where did he go, that mangy hound?
I'll see the color of his liver!
Where is he? Tell me where is he?
You addle-brained old idiot, what tongue do you speak?
It is the language of the gypsies. I learned it from my grandmother, Gypsy Rose Lee.
Enough, old pig. Tell me where he went or I'll slit your gullet.
If you mean my son, he was so fearful of you. He dove through yon window.
Over yon.
- Through yon window?
- Over yon. To a watery grave like this.
- Of course, he was much thinner than I am.
- So you're his scurvy cow of a mother.
- I have a mind to carve you to ribbons.
- Well, I'm not really his mother.
- You know how gypsies are.
- No, but I can rip you open and find out.
Why, the blundering swabs, they're blowing her up and me still aboard.
I'll have those devils swinging from the yardarm for this.
Blowing up the ship. He better hurry.
He'll be blown to bits. What about me?
Wait.
Stop! Don't! Don't you recognize me?
I'm trying to tell you, I stole these clothes.
I'm your shipmate, Charley.
Why, of course, it's Charley.
Hi, what have we here? Who are you?
Me? I'm Charley's aunt.
The pretty Mary Ann will sail the seas no more, Captain.
Blown to Davy Jones' Locker, she is.
Right well done, my lads. Broach another cask of rum on the main deck.
This day's work will be heard of far and wide.
- And the crew that did it shall not go thirsty.
- Aye, Captain.
But the jewel of which you spoke, Captain, where is she?
Come, you shall see.
The Hook is looking at you. Maybe it's me.
Sylvester, you should be ashamed of yourself in that disguise.
- Why don't you die like a man?
- Because I'd rather live like a woman.
Now I'm not so sure.
You see, Pedro, did I exaggerate?
Fetch her to my cabin.
Here come, me jewel.
No harm will come to you, fair lady.
You are the honored guest of The Hook.
Tell this filthy cutthroat to take his hands off me!
- You hear, Pedro? Our fair jewel has spirit.
- Aye.
- Handle her gently, but be off with her.
- Wait a minute!
- I've got something to say about this.
- Yes, what have you got to say?
Goodbye, Margaret.
Who brought this old hag on board?
She wouldn't bring a farthing in the slave market.
- Slit her gullet and throw her to the sharks.
- Aye!
Please, Captain, let me have this wench for myself.
Everybody on board always gets something, but I never get nothing.
What am I laughing at?
She ain't much to look at, but she's good enough for old Featherhead.
- Now wait a minute.
- What say ye, my lads?
Shall we give the old hag to the toothless one?
Yes!
Never let it be said, lads, that The Hook isn't generous.
Take her, toothless one, but when you sober up, I'll warrant you'll regret it.
- Did he hurt you, honey?
- I'm black and blue.
But don't worry, dear.
You're in my hands now.
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Come, sweets.
Where are you taking me?
To my quarters where we can be alone, just the two of us.
But couldn't we be engaged for a while?
I want you to respect me.
Remember, I saved your life.
From now on, you're mine.
You'll do anything I ask you to.
But if we wait, we can have a rose-covered cottage in the country.
I can see you now, coming home after a hard day at the asylum... me laying out your pipe and slippers and straitjacket.
- Lovely.
- Wait!
Let's be fair.
Now, my little gypsy sweetheart.
You come near me, and I'll scratch your eyes out!
Just as I thought.
You are not a woman. You're a man.
Don't be silly. I just had my hair cut.
I couldn't get any bobby pins.
Anyway, it's much cooler these hot nights.
You're a man. I knew it all along.
You didn't fool me. Nobody ever fools me.
Of course not. How can anybody fool you?
You're too smart.
Smart. They think I'm an idiot.
But little do they know how smart I really am.
Let's keep it a secret.
If you don't tell anybody I'm not a gypsy...
I won't tell anybody you're not an idiot.
You see these pictures on the wall?
I'm the ship's tattooer.
They think that's all I'm good for.
For 10 years, they've beat me and kicked me, but I'll get my revenge.
They've treated me like a dirty dog, but now I've got you for a partner.
Yeah, toss me a bone and let's get out of here.
No one must know our secret.
I'm going to help you to escape.
- Escape? Tell me more, Tyrone.
- You're going to repay me for my help.
Listen to everything I say.
I've stocked the dinghy. There are enough provisions in it for 10 days at sea... and if you follow the course
I have charted for you... you will arrive at the island of Casarouge.
Casarouge? What will I do there?
You will go to the Boar's Head Inn and ask for my cousin, Pierre Lamonte.
This is him.
He forgot to shave this morning.
You will give him this.
It contains the blood of 1,000 men.
The blood of 1,000 men?
Pretty anemic, weren't they?
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It's all right.
This is a map to a treasure worth 15 million gold crowns.
I stole it from The Hook.
But once you escape, he'll think you stole it.
- You think he'll be mad?
- Mad!
Why, if he ever catches you, he'll cut off your legs... and your arms and your ears and your nose.
- You mean, he'll streamline me?
- And then he'll slit your gullet.
I knew he wouldn't forget that.
Stop waving that knife at me.
But this knife is to close our deal.
- We'll both sign a pact in blood.
- In blood. Couldn't we use ketchup?
No, blood. It's my knife.
So it'll have to be your blood.
But I've got a knife of my...
Blood. Now, we're partners forever.
Come, I'll show you to the dinghy.
Runs his own blood bank.
You stay here, Featherhead.
I've got business.
What do you want?
Fortunes told. No charge today.
Have your palm read.
Very interesting. I see you have no trouble opening beer cans.
Out of my cabin, old hag, or I'll slit your gizzard.
Gizzard? What happened to my gullet?
It's a trick. You'll pay for this, both of you.
Curse you for a lily-livered witch!
You'll dance the devil's hornpipe at the end of the main yard.
I'll cut out your gizzard this night.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I've got a boat.
Are you all right?
You look like you're gonna faint.
No, I'm all right.
Hurry. We must get to the boat before it's too late.
Wait a minute. How do you get to this burg, this Casarouge?
With a ship's compass and a chart in the dinghy, a fool could follow it.
Are you coming along with us?
Sylvester, please forgive me for thinking you were a coward. You're a real hero.
Hurry.
- Goodbye, Featherhead.
- Goodbye.
Don't forget to give that envelope to my cousin at the Boar's Head Inn.
He'll pay you well for your trouble.
You can't miss him. He looks just like me.
He's twice as smart as I am.
A half-wit?
Does the compass say we're on our course?
I don't know.
How do you wind this thing up?
It's a compass. It always points north.
Yeah? It's no good. We're going South.
Why did you do that?
Now how are we going to get there?
Don't worry, I'll work it out. I'm part Indian.
Sylvester, tell me, why did you risk your life to save mine?
I figured I could use you in my act.
That's the only reason, so don't keep asking me about it.
Come here. Sit by me.
Now tell me the truth. Why did you expose yourself to such danger to rescue me?
I don't know. I guess I was so excited,
I forgot I was a coward.
I don't believe you.
I suppose you think I did it because I'm falling in love with you.
- Are you?
- Don't be silly. Why should I fall for you?
You're talking to Sylvester the Great, the man of seven faces.
I've got a girl for every face.
Whatever the reason, I owe you a lot more than I can ever repay.
It was a very brave and noble thing you did for me.
Yeah, I know.
I must have been out of my mind.
I guess the real reason I did it is because you're such a nice kid.
Hey, don't do that.
I might get to like that kind of thing.
First thing you know, you'll be wanting to put your arms around me... and hug me and kiss me, don't you?
No, it wouldn't be fair to those seven girls who are in love with you.
- I know how they feel.
- You do?
Because of love, I disobeyed my father... and ran out on a marriage into one of the noblest royal families of Europe.
Sure. Next thing you'll be telling me you're a princess or something.
Maybe you're right, Sylvester. Maybe it is the next thing I'll be telling you.
Maybe it is.
I'd better get you in out of this cold air.
You're breaking up, kid.
Sylvester, we're here.
It's Casarouge. We've made it.
We did? I told you if you'd relax and leave it to me, I'd get you here.
How do you feel? Have you still got those butterflies in your stomach?
- Yeah, but now they're wearing roller skates.
- You'll be all right now.
Let's get up on the dock. I need some rest.
- This town looks like a nice, quiet place.
- Help!
So you're still alive?
Hey, stop him!
Stop them, those two men.
Didn't you see that?
They murdered a man and tossed the body into the water.
- Why don't you do something?
- It's all right. They have a permit.
They have a... My mistake.
For a moment,
I thought they did something illegal.
It's all right. They have a permit.
Nice characters here.
Everybody in town must be Featherhead's cousin.
We'll find out soon enough. We should be at the Boar's Head Inn any moment.
Put 'em up.
- Nice morning, isn't it, citizen?
- Yes, it is.
Hey, look, isn't there something we can do about that?
I wonder what they do around here for excitement?
- Sylvester, look.
- I can't stand any more.
Look, the Boar's Head Inn.
Featherhead couldn't have been entirely insane. There is such a place.
Then he must have a cousin.
Featherhead said he'd pay us.
Let's give him this thing, get the money, and run out of town while we still got legs.
Good morning.
This is the Boar's Head Inn, isn't it?
Spit it out. What's your business?
We're looking for a gentleman named Pierre Lamonte.
- We've got something for him.
- You're too late.
He left here yesterday, said he won't be back for a fortnight.
- We can wait till tomorrow.
- Sylvester, a fortnight is two weeks.
Two weeks? How are we going to live?
What are we going to eat?
We're not satisfied with just anything.
You'll have to put us up in one of your best suites.
We're very particular about our meals.
And I'm very particular of getting paid for them in advance.
Monsieur Lamonte is supposed to have money for us.
- Now, perhaps if we could locate him...
- That ain't likely.
Nobody knows where he goes off to.
But he always comes back with gold and jewels and money.
Sometimes, I think he ain't honest.
Money. Sometimes, I think we'll wait here till he gets back.
- Now, if you'll please show us to our rooms.
- Follow me.
Find out where she gets her permanents.
Here you are.
This is the finest room in the inn.
I call it the Peach Bloom suite.
Peach Bloom? When do they sweep up the pits?
- Is this intended for me?
- Yeah.
- Where's my room?
- This is for both of you.
I think there's been a mistake.
We're not married.
- She's still courting me.
- This is the only room in the inn.
- You can take it or leave it.
- We can always go to another hotel.
- But there is no other hotel.
- But in a place this size, there must be.
Well, there was another hotel... and it gave me quite a bit of competition, too... but only last week, it burned down mysteriously.
Remind me to wear my asbestos pajamas tonight.
I see you haven't got much baggage.
In that closet there, you'll find some clothes.
You can have them if you want them.
They belonged to the last tenant. He died.
- What did he die of?
- Nonpayment of rent.
Natural causes. I hope it's not contagious.
I can't stay here. I've got to get to Jamaica.
Somebody here might recognize me.
What's all this 10, 20, 30 stuff about you?
What's the mystery?
- Who's going to recognize you?
- Why, anyone in Casarouge might.
Sylvester, I must tell you the truth.
I am of royal blood.
I've run away, and there's a price on my head.
- Take it off and we'll pay the room rent.
- But I tell you, I am the Princess Margaret.
You're a princess?
You better stop smoking that corn silk.
- You're snapping your cap. Princess.
- All right, believe anything you want.
But you've helped me this much.
For heaven's sake, help me get to Jamaica.
I'll reward you handsomely, Sylvester.
I'll pay you 5,000 doubloons.
Sure. You're carrying it in your bustle.
You've had it all the time.
I've got to pick up a few pennies for us to eat on... till Featherhead's cousin comes back.
Say, maybe the guy that had this room left a little silver lying around here.
Hey, case this handbill.
"Ye Bucket of Blood."
Bucket of Blood, that's what I've been looking for.
- I'll wade in there and get ajob.
- You sure they'll hire you?
They've probably heard of me.
If they haven't, it'll be easier.
I bet they haven't had high-class entertainment here in years.
- Maybe it'll work.
- Sure.
- What salary are you going to ask for?
- My usual salary.
But, Sylvester, we've got to eat.
I'm sorry. This dance is taken.
- Nice shooting, señor.
- Good shot.
Hey, this body, it's dead.
- Heart failure.
- Heart failure. Look at that.
He's not cleaning a pipe. He killed this guy.
Why don't you tell him?
- Why don't you?
- He probably knows it by now.
He's Don José Ramon Sebastian Alvarez.
This unfortunate dog has done a very bad thing.
- He's cast his shadow upon him.
- Bad casting.
- What happens to the body?
- They leave it out in front.
The collectors come by once a day.
Twice on Saturday.
That's all right.
I was afraid they'd accumulate.
You sound like a stranger.
You haven't lived in this town very long.
- Does anybody?
- What do you want here?
I came to talk to you on business.
I'm buying bodies for a medical school.
- No. That's just a gag. I'm looking for ajob.
- Come with me. Let us sit down.
- Hey, your shadow!
- Send for the collector.
Please, Don José! He's a stranger in town.
He doesn't know the rules.
You will teach him or I will.
I'll go to night school. I'll work it out.
Wait till you pay the tax.
Sit down. What is your business, stranger?
I'm Sylvester the Great.
You know, the Great Sylvester.
The name has no meaning.
You're buried here in the sticks.
They know me everyplace else in the world.
I can top any act you've ever had here in Casarouge.
- You wish to entertain?
- That's right.
What do you do?
I walk on the stage, and I open with a smash.
And then I build. I've got one of the...
- What happened?
- He didn't finish his drink.
It's an insult here, when you're drinking with someone...
- not to drain the last drop.
- Really? The last drop?
- What'll you have?
- A very short beer.
Two short beers!
Now about that act of yours.
My customers, they like to watch beautiful women.
It's kind of a hobby with them.
Sounds like something that might catch on.
- Now, if your act had a pretty girl in it...
- That's amazing that you should say that.
The other half of my act is over at the Boar's Head Inn.
But the name of your act,
I thought you worked by yourself.
No. We just call the act "Sylvester the Great" because she insists on it.
- This dame of mine has so much oomph...
- "Oomph." What's that?
Oomph? You know, that's with a...
Oomph, it's a sort...
Have you got a sweater around here?
Never mind, you'll hear about it sooner or later.
- What do you say? Do we get the job?
- Perhaps I give you a trial tonight.
- That's great. What about the money?
- Money?
Money, that stuff. It looks like...
That's funny.
I've forgotten what it looks like.
If my customers like your act, they throw gold on the stage.
What do they throw if they don't like the act?
- Lead.
- I had to ask.
Two short beers.
I'm not going in there. That's over my head.
Come, we'll seal our contract with a drink.
Come, drink up. You do not want the job?
Come, no man who refuses to drink with me walks out of here alive.
- No, thanks, I've had enough.
- Drink!
It's funny how quick you can develop a thirst.
Pardon me. I think I'd better be burping along.
Well done, stranger.
I like a man who can drink like that.
And now, you're going to drink with me.
Hugo, bring it over here.
Are you over the effects of that beer?
Yeah. That was a good idea, hanging me up by my feet for three hours.
Listen, I'm going out first and get them in the mood.
When I give you the cue, you come on.
If you're not doing so good,
I'll come again and save the act.
- But what do I do?
- You gotta sing or dance.
You can't just stand there. After all, these...
You can just stand there.
But, Sylvester, when you're on, who'll be looking at me?
I will. Boy, are you well stacked.
I wanna tell you something.
This stuff you been spreading around that I'm falling for you?
- Yes?
- Some of it's true.
But don't let it go to your head.
This act's gotta be a real partnership.
If everything works out well, you get 10% of the take.
Thank you.
I knew I could count on your generosity.
There's no use hogging it.
We want the actor!
Hey, you hear that?
They really want me there. In another minute, they'll be coming up the stage.
I hope they haven't got ropes.
Don't kid around about things like that.
Come on.
Shut up!
Gentlemen, tonight we have a special treat.
An act unparalleled in theatrical history... fresh from a triumphant tour of Europe.
Now, let me present the world's greatest quick-change artist...
- Sylvester the Great.
- That's me.
The man of seven faces.
Let's see the other six.
Who said that?
I did, you sniveling wooden-headed baboon.
What about it?
Gentlemen, please. Give him a chance.
We just finished cleaning the blood off the stage from the last act.
- Yes, we...
- Go ahead, Sylvester.
Gentlemen, my first quick-change is so fast,
I do it right in front of the audience.
I'm an old man.
I'm a very old man, and I have seen much of life.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Now, wait a minute, fellas.
This is going too far.
I don't mind people throwing vegetables, but you...
Told you, I don't mind. No mayonnaise?
Now, my next impersonation...
We don't like actors what do impersonations.
Let me introduce Sylvester the Great, world's greatest soft-shoe dancer.
- We don't like actors who dance!
- What kind of actors do you like?
Dead actors!
That's your cue.
I always get a big hand like that when I go off.
Pardon me, we're killing them.
How would you like
to kiss me in the moonlight?
How would you like
to hold me in your arms?
When your arms are so inviting
How can you keep from
turning on your charms?
Wouldn't you like my head
upon your shoulder?
Isn't that where you feel it ought to be?
While the night is so exciting
Wouldn't you like to fall in love with me?
I've got what you want
Darling, what's more
You've got what I want
So what are we waiting for?
Nothing is so romantic as a June night
Specially when the devil's in your eyes
How would you like
to kiss me in the moonlight?
You wouldn't like it half as much as I
'Cause I've got what you want
Darling, what's more
You've got what I want
So what are we waiting for?
Nothing is so romantic as a June night
Specially when the devil's in your eye
How would you like
to kiss me in the moonlight?
You wouldn't like it half as much as I
Say, not bad. You stick with me, and before you know it, I'll be wearing diamonds.
Have we enough to get out of Casarouge?
That's all I wanna know.
What for? We've stumbled onto a hot racket.
This is something the act never had before, money. A couple of weeks of this... plus what we get from Featherhead's cousin, and we'll be set.
- Did I do all right?
- Yeah, okay for a beginner.
It'll take time, but after a while... you'll be able to kill an audience the way I do.
- Or vice versa.
- Yeah.
Very funny, save it for the act.
Sylvester, did you notice that man in the front row?
- I didn't like the way he looked at me.
- That's something else.
I could tell you about that.
Or didn't your mother ever?
But get this. I know you did all right, but don't let it go to your head.
I don't want you to become a ham.
The first thing you know you'll be carried away.
Now, here we are. I figured it all out... and your share of the take is a nice, tidy sum.
What do you say?
Do you want me to keep it for you?
Margaret, where are you?
Giddap!
Hurry. Stop them.
Those men, my girl, they're putting her in a wagon. With horses.
They've kidnapped my act. I'll starve.
I mean, I love her.
- Too bad. She was good for the act.
- That's what I mean. Do something.
Guys can't just see a pretty girl, grab and carry her off like that.
- Why not?
- Why not? What kind of town is this?
I wanna have those men arrested.
Isn't there any law around here?
- Who can I go to?
- Let's see. There's the governor.
That's right. Where does he hang out?
He has a palace at the end of town but he's difficult to see.
Is that right? I'll see him.
There's only one thing on my mind, to rescue the woman I love.
Citizen to see the Governor on a matter of civil complaint.
I've always wanted to play the Palace.
- Your name, citizen?
- Sylvester.
- What's your last name?
- Crosby.
I can't help it. That's the name they gave me.
Of course, I'm a little thin for it.
Yes, what is it?
Citizen to see you with a complaint about law and order.
Approach, citizen.
Speak up. What's your complaint?
I wanna ask you what kind of town you're running here?
You may not believe this.
A big, fat, greasy slob... comes into the Bucket of Blood and runs off with my dame.
He's a big, dirty rat, and I want justice.
I'm just as good as he is.
Are you?
Well, practically... but he's a nice fellow when you get to know him.
No hard feelings.
So you took a fancy to a girl.
Everybody likes a pretty face.
- I like a pretty face myself.
- How interesting.
It is unfortunate that you do not have one.
Everybody's a comedian.
Furthermore, the young lady you are concerned about happens to be my guest.
And will remain so, until I'm ready to dispose of her.
Have you any further complaints, citizen?
Yes, but they're just little ones.
I don't wanna take up your time with them.
Well, I'll be going.
- I'll be staying.
- That's very kind of you.
Now, just precisely, what is your interest in this lady?
You got to be careful with her. She's no ordinary girl. You don't know who she is.
- Who is she?
- Well, she's a...
She's a princess. That's what she is.
A princess.
Of course, you'd never think of it to look at her.
On the contrary, you would.
She's the Princess Margaret... who has run out on her royal marriage to the Duke of Rochefort...
- to marry a commoner.
- She was?
I mean, she did? I mean, she is?
I'm asking a ransom of one million doubloons for her return.
Then she was telling the truth.
- Hey, that's a lot of money.
- So you're the commoner she loves.
Can I help it if a princess loses her head over me?
Oh, no.
You're quite likely to lose yours over her.
You wouldn't do that. I'm so young.
My head, why, I've hardly ever used it.
When the ransom is paid,
I shall return you both to the king.
He will throw his arms around her neck, and a rope around yours.
He wouldn't be interested in me. I...
I believe otherwise. I'm asking
100,000 doubloons for you.
But that's kidnapping.
You can't do that to me... or do you have a permit?
Guard, show our guest here to his quarters in the west wing.
- Quarters? I don't live here.
- Oh, but you do.
You may even do more than live here.
What do you mean?
What else can you do besides live?
Don't tell me. I got it.
You shall enjoy my hospitality and have the freedom of the palace.
But I would not advise you to attempt to escape.
You know what this is?
- I hope it's not what I know it is.
- It is.
The Jíbaro tribes of South America... have developed the art of shrinking human heads down to this size.
After much painstaking research and a great deal of practice...
I have learned their secret.
- It is now one of my hobbies.
- Hobbies!
You heard the Governor.
Show me to my quarters.
Somebody ought to get you interested in collecting stamps.
No, flunky, tell the Queen that King Sylvester cannot be disturbed.
I'm sleeping.
A beautiful handmaiden is approaching the windows, parting the curtains... for her royal master.
Another lovely tomato pulls down the covers... stroking my forehead.
Wake up. Wake up, Master.
Go away, will you,
I'm dreaming of beautiful girls.
They're real. And in Technicolor, too.
Your bath is prepared, Master.
His Excellency, the Governor, awaits your presence at breakfast.
- Do you girls come in here every morning?
- Yes, Master.
Boy, what a union.
We go now, but any time you desire us... you have but to reach over and pull the bell cord.
- I have to reach all the way over there?
- Yes, Master.
Ring the bell once for Suzanne, twice for Nanette... and three times for Yvonne.
When you hear that thing, all of you come.
Never mind for whom the bell tolls.
Oh, well, I can wait. What a racket.
Margaret.
Margaret!
Good morning.
Sylvester, are you all right?
What are you doing here?
And in these clothes?
In these clothes? I came to get you out.
This isn't Halloween.
Oh, Sylvester, I'm so glad you're here.
I'm frightened of La Roche, the way he looks at me.
- Yeah, we got a lot in common.
- I must get out of here at once.
I've gone on a hunger strike to try to hold La Roche off...
- but I don't know how long I can go on.
- You just keep that up.
I'll try to sneak some food to you somehow until we figure a way to escape.
- I would like to see you, me lady.
- La Roche.
He thinks I'm your boyfriend.
If he catches me here in this slipcover, he'll shrink my head into an umbrella handle.
Don't worry, I'll see you later.
- A bed with fender pants.
- Open up.
Quick, under here.
You try my patience, Your Highness.
I'm not in the habit of pounding on milady's door... like an impetuous schoolboy.
And I'm not in the habit of receiving uninvited visitors.
My dear, you will get used to it in time.
Come, let us sit down.
I've spent a restless night thinking of your beauty... and the proximity of your quarters.
- Does that please you?
- No.
- I demand that you release me at once.
- I tire of your silly dramatics.
- I've come to ask you to breakfast with me.
- I must refuse.
Very well. As I've told you before...
I abhor using force on a beautiful woman.
I'm willing to wait an hour, a day, even a week.
I have infinite patience.
I assure you it will be of no avail, no matter how long you wait.
You will come around when you get hungry enough.
You will find me of strong will, La Roche.
You must know
I am not one to be frightened... by the threats of such as you.
You will discover I am a man... who does not hesitate to carry out his threats, my dear princess.
I can be most ruthless when the occasion demands.
I will starve to death before I will accede to your wishes.
Come, let's be practical.
It will be many weeks before your ransom is forthcoming.
We will both grow lonely.
And if you think you can bribe any of my servants to bring you food...
I must tell you that I have given orders... to chop off the hands of anyone attempting to do so.
Oh, yes, I have news for you.
Your lover is here in the palace.
He is my prisoner.
My lover?
Frankly, I can't understand your taste in men.
You resist me... but for this little anemic, pot-bellied worm...
Of course he has a quick and pleasant wit... but as a figure of a man...
I've thrown the carcasses of better than he into my trash cans.
Surely he is not worthy of your attentions.
I must ask you to leave now,
Your Excellency.
That's no way for a guest to treat her host.
Come. A generous good morning kiss before I go.
No, let me go.
For the luxurious accommodations
I've provided you, Your Highness...
- I deserve some reward.
- You shall have your reward on the gallows.
An excellent reply, but it doesn't alter my intentions.
There now. That wasn't so bad, was it?
I am leaving now for a sumptuous breakfast.
Should you change your mind, you may join me anytime.
I wish you a hearty appetite.
- Are you all right?
- All right? This used to be my left eye.
I've been waiting for you.
Well, food, too.
Have I missed much of the floorshow?
Why, you look beautiful.
I hope the boys in the poolroom don't see me.
- I see you have all the accoutrements.
- I have?
- Sit down.
- What a drive-in.
Will you have one of these chickens?
No thanks,
I got three of my own in my room.
You mean the kind that don't fight back?
- I'm sorry.
- You may leave.
- Now be serious, Sylvester.
- Try later, girls.
I have asked you to breakfast with me because I believe you can help me.
The King's ship is due here before long with the ransom for the Princess.
In the meantime, I should like to enjoy my fair guest's company.
If you can assist me in this endeavor... you'll find great favor with me.
If you don't...
Quite so. The Princess is very stubborn.
This morning, she refused to breakfast with me.
I know. I mean, I knew she would.
Now, if you could persuade her to abandon this foolish hunger strike.
Don't worry.
The way things are working out...
I doubt she'll be able to hold out more than two, three months.
- Two or three months?
- Those new short months.
There are times, Sylvester, when I begin to doubt.
Out of my way, swine!
No one stands in the way of The Hook.
Capt. Barat, always the dramatic entrance.
- I had expected you sooner.
- I must talk to you, La Roche, at once.
- And alone.
- It's all right. He's a guest of mine.
How much are you asking for him?
- Come, join us for breakfast.
- There's no time.
Stand guard and see that we're not disturbed.
- Where are you going?
- I'll stand guard at the other side.
No, I want you two to know each other.
Sylvester, this is my great friend,
Capt. Barat, better known as "The Hook."
- Thank you.
- Sylvester, don't leave.
Sit down. You haven't eaten a thing.
Capt. Barat.
La Roche, I bear ill tidings concerning our treasure.
You've safely concealed it as I've instructed you, haven't you?
Aye, but it cannot be recovered without a map I had made.
- And the map?
- Blast me for a blundering fool...
- it was stolen from my ship.
- Stolen!
A curse upon you, Barat.
I've strung men to the gallows for less.
- How did this happen?
- It was stolen by an old hag of a gypsy... that I captured from the Mary Ann.
How did you manage to let an old gypsy... steal a parchment worth the ransom of 10 kings?
She escaped.
She took a dinghy and escaped.
Fool!
Plague and perish her ugly bones,
I shall have her.
We found the dinghy here, in the harbor of Casarouge.
- In Casarouge?
- Yes, that only means one thing.
The gypsy is here right under our very noses.
When I get my hook on that old gypsy...
I'll take her innards out, piece by piece.
I'll twist her arms out of her sockets.
The town shall be ransacked from top to bottom.
Anyone found in possession of the map will be tortured and hung.
We'll have a public hanging right here in the palace ground.
No, leave that old gypsy to me.
Hanging is too good.
She shall be boiled in hot lead.
What's wrong with hanging?
- Haven't we met someplace before?
- I don't think so, I've never been there.
- But your face...
- Oh, never mind about that face.
What about the Princess Margaret?
Wasn't she aboard the Mary Ann?
- Did she slip through your fingers, too?
- Oh, the Princess Margaret.
You were misinformed.
She was not aboard the Mary Ann.
That's too bad.
If you had her in your possession, you would divide the ransom with me?
Why, of course.
Naturally, if I had her in my possession,
I'd divide the ransom with you.
And if I had her in my possession,
I'd divide the ransom with both of you.
Sylvester likes to make jokes.
I'm sure your face is familiar.
No, it's just the jokes.
- I tell you, I'm sure I've seen you...
- And I'll be seeing you sometime, too.
I got to go now. Toodle-oo.
Don't take any wooden doubloons.
Well, how about that. How do you...
I thought I might get a little hungry before lunch.
I tell you, the two of them are working together.
The Hook kept staring at me.
He's suspicious.
You gotta keep out of sight or he'll figure the whole thing out.
Look in the lining of your coat, see if there's a grape or something.
I know you're hungry, but so is The Hook, and it's for my blood.
He thinks that I stole a map or something.
Even if it's just the pits of a grape,
I'll eat them.
You don't hear me talking about food.
Listen to what I'm saying.
- Lf he finds out who stole his map...
- Map? What map?
How should I know?
Some treasure map. It was stolen.
Treasure map?
That's what must be in the envelope
Featherhead gave you to give to his cousin.
You mean I've got lt?
But I'm not allowed to have it.
Do you know what they're gonna do to whoever has that map?
Come here. Look out this window.
Look at them building that gallows out there.
They're not going to use that noose to rope a moose.
- That's slumber lumber.
- What are you going to do?
Do? That map is in my room.
I'm gonna get rid of it. They're not gonna put me on the swing shift.
What are you gonna do with that?
- Oh, it's you, is it?
- Yes, surprised?
I'm gonna ram this thing down your throat.
What's the idea of giving me a thing like this?
- Know what they do to you for having it?
- Isn't it wonderful?
Wonderful! Are you crazy, or am I crazy for asking?
All things of value involve a risk.
This being the world's most valuable thing, involves the greatest risk.
Not for me. I'm getting rid of it right now.
- I'm burning it, see...
- You won't burn it.
- Oh, I won't, won't I?
- No, you won't, my gypsy friend.
Because I trust you.
We are partners in this forever.
Together, we will be rich.
We'll be rich if I have to cut out your heart to make you rich.
You can't scare me.
Anything that happens to me, happens to you.
How would you like The Hook to find out you gave me this map?
- But The Hook won't find out.
- Yeah? I'm going to make sure he doesn't.
And this man who is now the Governor's prisoner... you say he performed here?
- With a beautiful girl?
- Yes.
- What kind of an act did he do?
- He did impersonations.
Impersonations? What sort?
Well, to hear him tell it, he could do anything.
An old hunchback, a young nobleman, a buccaneer... an old gypsy.
Gypsy? He imitated a gypsy, did he?
That's the foul dog, all right!
I knew he looked familiar.
Let us make haste.
I will cut out that rogue's tongue and watch him eat it.
Wait, do not rush into a trap.
You are going hoodman blind into this venture.
Steady, my young cockerel.
What is this you say?
I say La Roche will have you dance the devil's tattoo on the air with your heels.
He has the Princess and he has the gypsy.
And so I say, he has the map, too.
By the Great Horn Spoon, you may be right.
Round up the men and prepare to sail at midnight.
I will go to La Roche and have this out with him... and while I am there,
I will lay my hook a fathom deep... in the liver of a certain slant-nosed gypsy.
But, La Roche, you cannot trust him.
But I have no proof that La Roche knows that his guest and the gypsy are one.
But I tell you this, if I'm not out of that palace in an hour... you and the men are to storm the walls and get me out.
- Good. And what of the map?
- Have no fear, I will have it.
And if La Roche is innocent, you may be assured of one thing:
The gypsy still has the map on him.
But, honey,
I was only trying to teach you how to swim.
Oh, it's you.
What's the idea, mashing my potato?
Forgive me, my dear partner,
I didn't mean to hit you so hard... but you shouldn't make me angry.
When my blood boils, I become insane.
You must have been percolating the day you were born.
That thing, the map!
I told you we've got to get rid of it, you creep.
This is practically a signed death warrant.
You're right. Whoever is found with it on him will be hung.
They're not gonna find the map on me.
I'm gonna tear it up.
Even if you tear it, it will not disappear.
That's right. They might find the pieces.
I better burn it.
Burn it? You can't burn it now.
Yeah, they might smell smoke and then find the ashes.
I know what I'll do.
Proclamation from the Governor!
Hear ye. Hear ye!
Death to the holder of the map!
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, it seems to have gotten around.
I'll get rid of this map if I have to eat it.
- Say, that's a good idea. We'll eat it.
- It can do no harm and I'm hungry.
Wait a minute. Why are you in such a sweat to get rid of it now?
'Cause I'm smarter than you are, and I'm only an idiot.
You wearing woolen underwear?
Here's a drumstick.
Hey, say... have you tried any of the colored parts?
Tastes pretty good.
I'm still on the white meat.
Give me another piece. I like it.
Was your mother ever frightened by a goat?
We're doing it the hard way, but I'm glad of one thing.
- I'm getting this map off my chest.
- Getting the map off your chest.
Come on, lay that egg and get it over with, will you?
- Sylvester, are you in there?
- Just a minute.
Quick, come on.
Hurry, get in the closet.
Sylvester, open.
Here, in case you get hungry.
Sylvester, open up.
Come, Sylvester...
I want you to take a walk with me.
I have something to discuss.
Sylvester, will you help me with a little problem of mine?
You won't be afraid to answer my questions honestly, will you?
What was your impression of Capt. Barat?
You know, The Hook.
My impression exactly.
But suppose his story is true... and the culprit who stole the map is within my grasp.
Whatever gave you that idea?
What's the matter, man?
What have you got on your chest?
I think I'm breaking out.
I ate something that didn't agree with me.
- I better go on a diet.
- No, it is our climate.
I was often troubled myself until I built a sulfur bath.
I take such a bath every night.
Tonight you will join me.
- You and I are gonna take a bath together?
- Why not?
I'll scrub your back and you may scrub mine.
I don't like the odds.
- Quite a tasty layout you have here.
- Yes, I like to live well.
My need for money is great.
That's why it is important that we find the map soon.
Didn't you know? Come along.
Convertible top.
You monster.
- Come, Sylvester.
- Here.
Come, man, the water is just right.
Remove your undergarments.
I'm bashful.
Oh, come, come.
Stop acting like a coy young maiden.
Take it off.
No, I like to keep it on.
It's the only way I can get my laundry done.
Stand back. Here I come!
Come on.
- Sylvester, where are you?
- Here.
- Sylvester.
- Here.
Sylvester, listen to me.
Here!
- Stop it, man. What are you doing?
- I was just looking for the soap.
Here it is. I'll soap your back first.
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing? What is it?
Curse you for a lubberly oaf!
This is the last time you shall make sport of me.
What do you mean, bursting in on us like this?
- What's the idea? Wanna get in trouble?
- Trouble, is it?
- Careful, Barat, he's my guest.
- Guest?
- He is the gypsy.
- Gypsy? Have you lost your wits, man?
I can prove what I say.
Wait a minute, I'm coming out. Wait.
This dog will talk or I'll slit his gullet.
Come gypsy, the map... or I'll carve your hide to ribbons.
The map!
- He had it tattooed on his chest!
- No.
- You see, La Roche?
- By heaven, it is! I've been hoodwinked.
- Luckily the gallows are ready.
- I can explain everything.
- Go ahead.
- I...
Come to think of it, I can't.
Hold it!
Stop him! Don't let him get away, Barat.
Slit his gullet.
Stop him.
What's the meaning of this?
Quick, my chest.
That idiot Featherhead. Look what he did.
- What is it?
- It's the map, I've got to get it off.
I'll tell them it was a mirage.
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm gonna make a clean breast of it.
- Who's that at the door?
- It ain't opportunity. I'm getting out of here.
Wait a minute, Hooky, old boy,
I can explain everything, wait.
There, Mr. Hook. That squares our account.
I have your map and your life.
Now we must get out of here.
- Stop reading my mind.
- Quite ajob I did.
I'm an artist and so are you, Sylvester the Great...
- and I have a plan for our escape.
- Yeah, I know your plans.
- I bet this time we chew each other up.
- This is a clever plan, though risky.
- Now wait a minute, I got a plan, too.
- Not as good as mine.
I hate arguments, don't you?
If I didn't know who you was,
I wouldn't know who you was.
Say, maybe this is the eighth face
I've been looking for. Come on.
Where are we going?
We've got no time for the Princess.
I've got to get you and the map out.
You take the map and I'll get the girl.
No, we can't do that, can we?
- Halt.
- Out of my way, you lubberly oaf... or I'll slit your gullet and shove it down your gizzard.
Begging your pardon.
I have orders to let no one in...
Quiet! You mangy hound, a pox on you!
I'll flay thy bones.
- I'll carve thy filthy hide into ribbons.
- Yes, Capt. Barat.
Come, my proud beauty! A pox on you.
Avast, ahoy, you'll come with me before I slit thy gullet.
Sylvester, what's the matter with you?
Where did you pick up that kind of language?
- You didn't fool her.
- Somebody tipped her off.
Now I understand.
You were supposed to be The Hook.
Yeah, that's the general idea.
Not bad, boot hook.
I've got brains. We better get out of here, before they scatter all over the joint.
Halt! Stop those men.
Where you going?
And you, get back to your room.
You dare speak to The Hook that way?
He'll cut you to shreds.
- The whole scurvy lot of you.
- He will, will he?
Away, La Roche, a pox on thee.
The gypsy is slain.
You can have the blasted map and the blasted treasure.
All I want is the blasted gal.
I'll see you around sometime.
You're not leaving, my good friend.
By the bait or spoon, shiver my timbers, avast, ye lubbers.
Ye dare stand in my way and I take this hook... and I'll rip out your innards.
So you're frightened.
You see, I have the upper hand, I...
No wonder. "Made in Japan."
Enough of this masquerade.
- To the dungeons with them.
- Yeah? You think you can take me alive?
How did you know?
Wait till I get you outside.
Have no fear, Captain.
- We'll wipe out these curs and set sail.
- Go to, my lad, go to.
- Aye.
- I'm going, too.
Carry Capt. Barat to the ship at once.
This wench, take her along, too,
Captain's orders.
- Capt. Barat, and wounded.
- A present from the Governor.
That fat pig must think me dead.
But I shall return and teach him differently.
Give me that cloak.
Remove your shoes.
Capt. Barat, you've been hurt.
Aye, I'll flay their bones, a pox on them all.
La Roche shall pay for this treachery.
I'll chop off his liver.
Say, that might be pretty good, chopped liver.
- Stand guard till we cast off.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Better make haste, or La Roche and his troops will be upon us.
La Roche, a pox on him, I'll flay his bones.
I'll slit his gullet,
I'll bury my hook in his gizzard.
I'll carve him to ribbons, I'll slay his gullet.
I'll rip open his gizzard.
I'll hoist him from the yardarm... and let the crows pick out his eyes.
I'll return with 1,000 men... and hang La Roche from his own gallows.
- Stand guard till we cast off.
- Aye, aye.
Stand by yon main topsail halyards!
Hang sheets and places.
Captain, we stand ready to sail.
- What orders?
- Oh, yeah. I mean, aye, aye.
Avast the mainsail, hoist the rudder... scuttle the portholes, unfurl the anchor, and shiver my timbers.
Any questions? I mean, aye!
Methinks, Captain, the blow on thy head has cluttered thy mind for the moment.
Methinks a little rest.
Methinks so, too.
Get this ship out of the harbor...
- and head north for Jamaica.
- North to Jamaica!
But, Captain, the treasure lies south.
To the north lies danger.
To the south is safety.
We're always certain of friends in the south.
Oh, a Democrat?
Fetch me the Princess Margaret.
Bring her to my cabin.
- I've got the Parcheesi board all set up.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Let go of your forward lines. Down helm.
Well done, Pedro.
We're under sail before La Roche can gather his wits.
Head due south.
But Captain, did you not want us to head north?
You're not here to question, but to obey.
- South, I say.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Head due south.
- South it is, sir.
- Captain, here is Princess Margaret.
- Take her below and put her in irons.
I'll settle with her later.
- But, Captain I thought you told...
- What?
Does everybody aboard question my orders?
Take her below!
Why do you stare?
Anybody would think there's something peculiar about me.
I will dress. Perhaps then you will not find me so amusing.
Where's the Princess?
- I put her in irons as you ordered.
- That's fine.
Irons? I told you to bring her to my cabin.
- Hurry or I'll slit your gullet.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Give me that bottle.
Aye, hatch the poop deck.
Don't push me around.
- What's going on here?
- Here's the Princess, Captain.
What? You stupid pig!
- Put her in irons!
- But Captain, you told me...
- Put her in irons.
- Give me back my bottle.
Hear this, you men,
I don't want to see the Princess... until I give the order. Understand?
Where's the Princess?
- Well, where is she?
- Marshal took her away as you ordered.
- Have him bring her back. Immediately!
- Yes, sir.
Begging your pardon, Captain... but didn't you just have your underwear on?
I still got it on. What am I, a nudist?
Here she is, Captain.
What, again? Take her away.
Take her away, you bumbling baboon.
Are you all mad as well as deaf?
Where's the Princess?
Who do you think you're monkeying around with? I'm The Hook.
H-O-O-K-E. Fetch me the Princess.
I grow impatient.
For a minute, I thought it was busted.
- So, gypsy, we meet again.
- Wait a minute, you're dead.
- Am I?
- No, I guess it's me.
You know, Sylvester...
I feel that all these terrible things that have happened to you have been my fault.
Isn't that funny, I feel the same way.
I'm going to do something to make it up to you.
It better be good.
These ain't charm bracelets we're wearing.
You got a nail file?
Sylvester, I was saving this for myself.
- It contains only one bullet.
- Yeah, I know how you feel, Princess.
Make it fast. I don't want to watch you die.
Oh, no, Sylvester.
At least I know what The Hook has in store for me.
But you, I shudder to think what he'll do to you.
- Here.
- No, I must be brave and face it like a man.
- Close your eyes and I'll shoot you.
- No, I can't let you.
- I'll shoot you.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Where are you going to do it?
- It'll be merciful, Sylvester.
- Right through the brain.
- Merciful?
Couldn't you just shoot me in the foot and let me bleed to death slowly?
Goodbye, my dear. This is fini.
The curtain rings down on the great Sylvester.
Not to cheering crowds, but in a filthy dungeon.
- But...
- Tell them I died nobly, bravely.
- But Sylvester, I didn't shoot you.
- What?
It must be La Roche, he's trailed us.
He'll have his revenge this night. Fire at will.
Blast them from the sea.
'Tis The Hook's ship.
Our search is ended.
Return fire!
Sylvester, the cannon have stopped.
It must be La Roche's ship.
- They're boarding us now.
- I can feel my head getting smaller already.
You're wanted on deck, my lady. You, too.
- Lf I wasn't chained...
- Sylvester, they want us on deck.
Yeah, La Roche.
Okay, hand me my harp and let's get going.
Well, what do you know, they've hooked The Hook.
Now that I've got the chance...
I want to tell you, all the time you were chasing me I was putting on an act.
I bet you thought I was scared, a coward, and shaking in my boots.
- Boo!
- I bet you were right.
Well, Featherhead.
- Don't worry about a thing. I'll get you out.
- Oh, no. I like it.
Father!
Thank heaven you're unharmed, my child.
How do you like that? The King.
Hi, Your Honor.
How's the Queen and all the little Jacks?
I'm a card.
I just...
- Father, how did you ever find me?
- And we thought you were La Roche.
La Roche is my prisoner.
He turned blubbering coward when placed in the rack.
He told all and gave me the course...
The Hook must sail to retrieve his buried treasure.
And now, my child, you're safe with me once again.
You mean, you're taking me back?
I've learned the futility of trying to impose my will on yours.
Marry whom you wish.
You have my blessings.
Oh, Father. You'll not regret this.
I love him, though he's but a commoner, a humble servant of Your Majesty.
- But he's so kind, so noble, and so...
- Handsome?
And he's right here on this ship.
Of course, I'm not working steady, but what does that mean to a king?
- A little dowry, you'll never miss it...
- Are you?
Darling!
My darling.
Stick around, son, something older may show up for you.
How do you like that?
I knock my brains out for nine reels... and a bit player from Paramount comes over and gets the girl.
- This is the last picture I do for Goldwyn.
- Pardon me.
- Don't make a meal out of it.
- Go sell your rack, shellac.

Well, you're not just some pumpkin.
Some son of a country boar.
You're a gentleman.
Remember that when you get to Paris.
A D'Artagnan from Gastonny is as much a gentleman as anybody else.
Maybe more so.
Yes, father.
Now I give you this letter for monsieur De Treville, he is a Gaston.
He's captain of the King's musketeers.
I can't give you anything else.
A little advice.
A few crowns.
A horse.
A horse?
A great black horse?
A horse, yes.
It's not the horse.
It's not the money.
It's that letter to monsieur De Treville.
And remember above all that you are a D'Artagnan.
Your honor is your treasure.
And you are nothing from any man.
I've taught you the sword.
Now alright.
The slightest insult.
The smallest spoke.
My son.
Father.
I shall endure nothing sir from any man!
Bye...
Boy!
My horse.
Boy!
My horse.
You find me amusing?
Perhaps you will find three feet of steel even more amusing.
If you are trying to be as funny as your horse.
You haven't a chance.
I endure no such remarks from any man.
Watch him fender.
Monsieur?
Forgive me My Lady, there will be a short delay, while I dispose of this local fire pot.
Which is more important?
Richelieu's mission or your petty quarrels?
How do you know he's one of the King's spies?
But my Lady, I...
Sir, I await your pleasure.
Must I arrange everything?
Soldier, if he has any papers; destroy them.
Yes, my Lady.
"MUSKETEERS HEADOUARTERS"
Where do I find monsieur De Treville, captain of the King's musketeers?
Inside, up the stairs.
What am I going to do with you?
As a King's musketeer Aramis, you'd make a fine priest.
And you Porthas.
A fine structure to hang pretty clothes on.
With Athos.
Ill captain. Very ill. Mortally ill.
Then recapture me.
What do you want?
A monsieur D'Artagnan.
He has no letter.
Then why are you bothering me?
He's a Gaston sir.
Show him in.
The three of you brawling.
Getting yourself arrested.
By three of Richelieu's guards.
When you weren't even outnumbered.
The King is humiliated.
Forgive me captain, I am late.
You are wounded.
Who told the King we weren't outnumbered?
He was lying.
Tell me who said it and I will cut him...
I will address you, or report the affair to the King.
My apologies, gentlemen.
Dismissed.
Monsieur De Treville.
I ask one favor, my captain.
Let mine be the hand that avenges these men.
I have a bad cough.
These three men happen to be the three best swordsman in Paris.
I think Gaston; they can take care of themselves.
What is it you want?
To be a musketeer.
I admire your spirit, but you have come to me without even a letter.
I had a letter.
It was stolen.
Oh, that swine, if I get my...
Quietly, quietly.
What happened?
Well Sir, it was at Desacres.
A great tall, ugly man with a scar.
Was he alone?
There was a Lady in a carriage.
A very beautiful lady.
Did he speak her name?
No sir, he called her a Lady, but...
Do you know them sir?
She's back.
I beg you. Tell me their name.
I am going to the King.
D'Artagnan, a man is sometimes known by the enemies he makes.
You will receive an appointment to the cadets.
In due time you may perhaps be admitted to the musketeers.
Monsieur!
Captain, my gratitude.
I...
...then tarnish.
Clumsy, big-footed idiot!
You are addressing a future musketeer.
A future musketeer?
If you get the cackle birds out of your hair perhaps.
And the barn yard out of your manners.
I resent that.
Well, I shall give you every opportunity to put your resentment behind the Luxembourg at noon.
Willingly sir.
The duchess gentlemen.
The duchess is swooned by feet.
I'll rapture my cape and...
My cape
A thousand crowns!
How do I get out of here?
By the end of my foot.
I endure no such insult from any man.
Rapture and endure my sword in your belly at the Louvre.
Name the hour.
One.
One.
Well.
What?
You embarrass me.
Aramis, don't tell me there is no Lady in your life?
My life is dedicated to things of the spirit, not of the flesh.
My habit may be that of a musketeer, my habits are not.
You sir!
Who, me?
Yes, you!
Wait!
I was addressing you sir.
What is your hurry?
No, hurry at all sir. Oh, that's better.
Come on, that's enough.
Now tell me.
Do I look like a man who spends his time with the ladies.
Well, if you don't sir, then Paris must sigh with the Ladies sighs.
That's not what I asked.
These gentlemen insist that
I waste my time with the Ladies.
I cannot conceive, sir.
That in the company of a Lady, you would waste a single moment.
Man...
Take your heel, before I take your throat.
Monsieur Aramis, your language.
Would you care to object to my language behind the Louvre at one o'clock?
Yes sir.
Couldn't we make it at two?
Well, you are in good time.
Where are your seconds?
Oh, I have no seconds monsieur Athos.
I only arrived in Paris last night.
What a pity.
To arrive in Paris on one day and to be killed on the next.
Oh, there is no hurry, my second hasn't arrived yet.
With all respect sir.
Would it be proper if we didn't wait?
You see, I have a similar appointment in an hour.
That is, if I survive this one.
No, just as you say.
But don't worry about it, you won't survive.
You know, you're quite a fellow.
Your first day in Paris and two duels.
Three.
I have another one an hour later.
Oh no.
Are these your seconds?
Athos, this is not the man you fight?
Why not?
But I fight him in one hour.
And I am too.
You are too?
What a complete madman!
You know I'm affording a positive affection for you.
You can afford his affection.
You will get him before he is a corps.
Who are you to complain?
Complain!
Now just a minute!
Who found him first?
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, your quarrels are with me, not with each other.
To talk so well and to die so young.
I really do regret this.
Sorry, you're wounded.
You'll find the left hand most confusing.
Come on.
Ready?
Athos! Hussacs
Richelieu's guards.
Five of them.
Leave your swords.
You are under arrest.
Three against five uh?
Four against five.
This gives me great pleasure gentlemen.
Duels are forbidden.
In the name of
Prime Minister Richelieu,
I arrest you.
Do your best in the King's name.
Why don't you use your right hand, Athos?
I save my right hand for my drinking.
Touche!
Be careful. That's Husac
Behind you.
Let him go.
Gentlemen!
No, come watch.
Is this the peasant you were going to fight with your left hand?
Hey!
Hey!
Bravo! Bravo!
Who are you?
Tell Richelieu, the name is D'Artagnan.
You are moderate men.
Which one of you was so vulgar to use a dueler's trousers as a target?
I did sir.
You did that act!
By tomorrow you'll be the talk of Paris.
But you have a great deal to learn.
Richelieu is the King's first minister.
He is an unpopular, but an extremely powerful man.
Richelieu has many ambitions.
Such as war against England.
And most important, the complete destruction of the King's powers.
The King's position is delicate.
We don't want to make it impossible.
Send him back a corps alright.
But don't send him back with his trousers dripping.
Now do you understand?
No, sir.
Captain De Treville.
His majesty the King orders the immediate presence of
Captain De Treville, musketeers
Athos, Aramis and Porthas.
And somebody called D'Artagnan.
Find that brainless cut throat.
Yes, your Majesty.
Obvious imbeciles!
Which is this one?
D'Artagnan, your Majesty.
Well find him some decent clothes.
How can I face Richelieu when my men don't wear decent clothes?
Which of these is the one that so embarrassed me?
D'Artagnan, your Majesty.
Imbecile!
Don't they realize that
Richelieu is my dearest friend and stance defender?
They are too young, Majesty.
Don't they realize that the dignity of my first minister is the dignity of...
They're impetuous men your Majesty
Don't interrupt me when I am talking well.
What did you say?
They're impetuous men your Majesty.
Impetuous imbeciles!
Five hundred francs.
Go on. Go on! Go on away.
And get him some decent clothes.
Wardrobe, a valet, a horse.
All he needs now is a rich widow.
Planchet, my horse.
Gentlemen, my quarters.
Welcome to your quarters
D'Artagnan.
Get that man out of here!
He claims to be your landlord.
He is, monsieur Bonnasieux.
Just as I suspected.
He was telling the truth.
Well, get him out of here.
I can not abide landlords.
Please, just a moment of your time.
I need you sir.
I live below you.
I am going away on a long journey and won't be back for weeks.
I have a goddaughter named Constance.
She is in danger sir.
In danger of what?
Well, she is one of the queen's maids.
I suspect she is been followed by Richelieu's men.
Richelieu's men are notorious for their complete lack of taste.
I believe that.
I beg your pardon sir, but the purposes are, as I suspect, political.
But she is trusted, by the queen.
Well, I beg of you sir.
It won't be a matter of any great inconvenience.
She comes home from the palace only once or twice a week.
You can keep an eye on the street from your windows.
And here.
You can keep an eye on our rooms.
Athos.
That all sounds a little too convenient.
The floorboards, the Goddaughter, the danger
And my young friend has recently distinguished himself as an outstanding defender of the throne.
It smells my dear landlord, of Richelieu.
Now get out of here.
Oh, gentlemen.
Planchet! Remove this man.
I swear to you.
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
He rolls well.
Planchet!
Get me some nails and a hammer.
Maybe I can borrow some from the landlord.
Hey!
Get out!
Oh monsieur, monsieur.
You come from heaven.
No, mademoiselle.
Just from upstairs.
Who ever you are, in the queens name I thank you.
And now please, please, just for an instant.
Alright? Please.
Master, you're wounded.
Mortally, fatally, in the heart.
I shall get a physician.
I shall never recover.
Keep watch man.
I am on the queen's business.
Sorry monsieur, to be in such a hurry.
No greater hurry then I.
I love you.
What?
I love you. I love you.
Oh mademoiselle, inside me is a raging storm.
From the first instant
I behold you.
By the way, what's your name?
Constance.
Constance.
Oh, Constance.
My all.
My all.
My blood rages like a torrent.
My heart beats like a drum.
I come from the end of the earth to employ you.
I thought you said you came from upstairs.
R from you as that is what it takes to be at the end of
You're mad.
No, don't stop.
Lace me off my back while you are talking.
I'm your servant, your subject, your slave.
Your pleasure is my life.
Your will, my law.
My life is yours.
My heart, my sword.
Anything you demand.
My last drop of blood.
Why do I have to style out oasis?
I didn't do very well, did I?
I was only trying to say
I love you.
Maybe you should tell me your name first.
D'Artagnan.
D'Artagnan?
The famous swordsman.
The famous will be.
Oh, no.
I only came from the country a few days ago, I...
I just got these clothes today.
The famous D'Artagnan.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go.
No.
Oh, D'Artagnan.
I am just as simple as you are.
I'm just a girl who works at the palace and...
I am not used to being in love.
I'm late.
Oh, I am late.
Swear on your honor you won't follow me.
But you're not going out of here alone.
Oh trust me.
I beg of you, trust me.
Where are you going?
If you love me, please, please don't follow me.
But I...
You asked me to trust you.
D'Artagnan!
Eave me to keep some cheap rendez-vous on a stree
Stop. Stop.
It's George, the minister of Buckingham,
Prime Minister of England.
Buckingham!
I'm sorry my dear, but the man can not be left in the possession of such knowledge.
It becomes my necessity to kill him.
Oh, your grace.
He is loyal to the queen and besides I...
I love him.
I face Richelieu and all his spies and than I am risking being impaled on a lovers sword?
What a fate for England.
Come.
In here a moment please.
Your Majesty, a messenger from Spain has come with intelligence about your presence.
Her majesty the queen.
Anne, my little Anne.
George. A thousand times you must not come.
A thousand times I shall come.
Why don't you help me?
Why can't you understand?
I understand nothing except that I love you.
But the earth is small and there is no room on it for you and me apart.
Oh, my darling.
Confess to me that you still love me.
Bear your tears in my evidence.
I weep for myself.
For my husband, for my country.
Your country is wise.
But your husband is an idiot.
But Richelieu's spies are everywhere.
In my court, in my bedchamber.
I have no one to trust.
You have me.
I have?
Chelieu's spies discovered you were coming to France even before you left England.
And Countess De Winter?
What intimate circumstances did she discover the se
Anne!
Can't I even trust you?
And I love you.
And I can't help myself.
You accuse me of faithlessness?
No.
I accept it.
George, I love you.
But you must not come here again.
I forbid you ever to come to Paris.
Alone, in disguise, at the mercy of Richelieu's villains.
Richelieu forbids me to come as ambassador.
Then I shall never see you again.
No, if I can not see you as beggar.
If I can not see you as ambassador, then I shall see you as conqueror.
You understand?
Buckingham.
England is mine.
France shall be mine and you shall be mine Anne.
But you must go.
Here.
I give this to you in parting.
We must never meet again.
I shall treasure these like I treasure the dearest recollections of you Anne.
As I treasure the anticipation of our next meeting.
The countess De Winter.
Your Excellency.
Welcome my Lady.
And you were never so welcome as at this moment.
Nor so unwilling to come.
You promised me a holiday.
I am having my holiday.
Oh.
And what is the name of your holiday?
The count De Wardes?
Do you know everything that transpasses in France?
I only know that I am in the midst of a great project.
And that you my Lady, are part of that great project.
I need you my Lady.
Buckingham is in possession of a set of diamond studs.
Twelve studs.
I would be grateful, immensely grateful, if you were to go to England and steal two of them.
Steal two.
What am I, a common thief?
I could hardly trust a common thief with such a mission.
The jewels were presented to Buckingham only last night.
By the queen.
Oh, so he reached the queen.
How comical, despite all your precaution.
I leave the making of excuses to Rosewood.
And his excuses can be quite imaginative.
It is claimed that some lone monster named D'Artagnan annihilated all my men.
Oh no, what a catastrophy!
It takes a good man to prevent a catastrophy my Lady.
And a great man to make use of one.
You and I, my dear are rare creatures in this ancient world of impulsive men.
We have intellect.
We think.
When we think our impulsive enemies are helpless.
The King opposes my plans for war with England.
It is my belief that if Buckingham's relations with the queen can be demonstrated, his Majesty's objection to my plans may be lessened.
But your grace, how can you trust me with such a confidence?
What if I refuse to go to England?
Can there be any one be more trustworthy than an ambitious woman of fashion... with a history?
You said yourself my Lady,
I know everything that transpires or has transpired... in France.
The spies. They're everywhere.
Can you go to England?
To England?
Nobody knows I come to you.
Only the queen.
Oh the poor queen.
Oh Constance.
Richelieu arranged a banquet for the first of the month for the express purpose of displaying the queen's new jewels.
It's a set of twelve diamond studs and he gave them to her for her birthday and she has to wear them.
But I...
But they're in England.
She gave them to Buckingham.
Richelieu has found out and now he wants the King to find out.
And she just has to wear them at the banquet or...
Well, it's only nine days and I don't...
I love you.
Oh...
Oh, you need this letter.
You tell the queen I'll be back with the jewels in nine days time.
What would I do without you?
When I come back...
When you come back...
So this letter must be delivered in England and the jewels returned to Paris by the first of the month?
We have just one advantage.
Richelieu doesn't know we're going.
My friend, my friend.
My young country friend.
When will you learn about Paris?
By now, Richelieu, without the slightest question, knows even the color of your underpants.
Well, it is my obligation, not yours.
If we all went, there'd be a better chance that one of us would survive to return to Paris.
To die among friends.
Can a man ask more?
Can a world offer less?
Who wants to live till the last bottle is empty?
It's all for one D'Artagnan.
And one for all.
On your way
Four against one...
In the queen's name wouldn't you, on your way!
Stay with your master, Porthos. Go!
The town of Becourt lies just beyond there.
I once knew a Lady that lived there.
Some of my most beautiful memories are associated with this road.
D'Artagnan, are you alright?
D'Artagnan, are you alright?
This way, lieutenant.
That was long ago, I tell you.
I hope your Lady still lives in the town.
That was long ago, D'Artagnan!
Long ago!
Separate, men.
We will cut them off.
Here, master!
Husanne.
We meet again, D'Artagnan.
Ride, D'Artagnan, the queen.
Planchet.
A boat for England.
The port was closed last night.
By whose orders?
Richelieu, monsieur.
Our beloved Reginald.
A boat for England.
No boats.
The port is closed.
I am the count De Wardes.
I have special permission for revenue.
You will have to get it signed by the governor of the port.
Where could I find this individual?
The last house on the point.
And such a handsome man he was.
Don't talk like that.
He is not dead.
Well, I'd rather be dead than resemble a seal.
Or maybe I...
Maybe I'd just rather be dead.
What a man.
Hmm.
I said what a man.
Letters from the famous
Countess De Winter.
By the way, Planchet, don't forget.
My name is...
I am the count De Wardes.
The count Du B...
I can not think of no one
I can put my trust in.
The only good thing is that you are not an Englishman.
An Englishman in his grace would probably take this box back to Paris without looking to see what is inside it.
With all respect Sir,
I am a Frenchman.
You skeptic.
Malice.
Malice!
You disgusting thief.
Which one of you stole these jewels?
I will have you hanged from the highest bridge in London.
Oh, your...
Don't lie to me!
No one has been in my room, except...
Summons my jeweler.
This instant!
How many days do you have left?
Five?
Without the one or two stops, sir...
Never mind about that.
If your feet have wings and you roll the wind.
How long does it take to get to Paris?
Three days.
You are alone?
I came to Paris with friends, Sir.
I hope at least one of them is alive and can help me get back.
Rosewood. Draw 100,000 Francs for the Countess De Winter.
Yes, monsieur.
Oh and Rosewood, what about that body of young D'Artagnan?
He is dead.
Excellent.
Then why do you look so unhappy?
Well, five of my men have each assured me he has killed him.
And each of them in five different places.
Place extra guards on every road.
Close the gates of Paris until D'Artagnan's corps is delivered to me here in my palace.
Or his person is lodged in the Bastille.
Yes, monsieur.
Nobody has seen him.
I have every confidence that you, you a man of equal capacities to the King, will someday be equal to a man that is not yet a musketeer.
Hello, D'Artagnan.
Portos!
I thought you were wounded.
I am, I am, but the jewels...
Here, safe.
Ah, that man, that Buckingham.
Two have been stolen and he wants two made in 48 hours.
Well, come on, man.
Take your horse. I need you.
Porthos, when did a wound come between you and a fight?
Well, unfortunately the position of this wound comes between me and my horse.
I give you my word
I was not running away.
I was fighting magnificently when... who should appear?
But no, what a beautiful woman.
I let my eyes stray for just one moment when... zip
I am disgraced.
When was I ever wounded in a locality?
So it was impossible to explain.
Well.
I can see you're in doubt.
No, my dear friend, merely in a hurry.
Where can I find Athos?
In a monastery.
Where?
My friend Athos has renounced the world of the flesh.
But it has only been a few days.
Yes. He says a great deal can happen in a just few days that can change a man's life.
I suspect...
His Lady has great courage in remembering him.
Oh heaven, heaven.
Let Athos still be alive.
I said wine!
I have none.
What kind of idiot...
Why don't you go down in your cellar?
I can't go down there.
Why not?
Merci, gentlemen.
Believe me, there is a madman in my cellar.
A madman.
He took refuge in my cellar a week ago.
He's been down there for a week.
All my food. All my wine.
Three more days like this and I am ruined.
Athos, Athos!
Open up, it's D'Artagnan.
Open up, it's D'Artagnan!
We'll fight dragons with wine...
D'Artagnan.
My friend, welcome!
Welcome.
My beautiful magnificent friend.
Hinault, wine for monsieur D'Artagnan.
The best in the house for my dearest... for monsieur D'Artagnan.
I thought we had to be in Paris tonight.
Here man, I'm drinking.
Please sober up, for heaven's sake.
Ah purity.
His Lady doesn't approve of drink.
Let me tell you about women.
Athos.
I knew a woman once...
Athos!
No. Let's say that
I had a friend.
An aristocratic young friend.
He knew a woman.
Athos, for heaven's sake.
Have you forgotten we are riding to the queen?
I was telling you about women.
Women! Women are the things of your own making!
Have you forgotten our pledge?
All for one and one for all?
You pumpkin, village fool.
You hero.
What do you know of anything besides swordplay?
I was speaking of women?
This friend is aristocratic, a friend.
Fell in love with a country witch.
He married her.
Took her to his ancestral bed.
She was beautiful.
He worshipped her.
He saw her as nature was.
The pure, the good.
His angel of light.
But within a week's time his angel of light had led a neighbor, a young and truthful life of chastity and together they eluded the local church.
My friend run the confession for the woman and turned her over to the executioner.
They branded and shouldered her.
Then they cast her out of his house, renounced his ancestral claims and he fled.
He changed his name and joined the legions of the king.
He never saw the woman again.
But he still loves her.
I am speaking of...
We will ride to Paris.
Move on.
Move on.
Planchet, take the horses inside that barn.
Hold those men.
In richelieu's name,
Stop or I'll fire!
Guards!
Surround that barn!
Get to the loft!
D'Artagnan!
Will you surrender?
I drink too much.
Come on!
Oh my headache!
Come on! Attack the barn.
Seize firing.
D'Artagnan.
If we should meet again.
I believe I was drinking this morning.
I will.
I can tell fairy tales when I drink.
You remember that.
Are we to surrender?
No, we will be here two minutes and you will be free.
The gates of Paris will be open.
Come along, Planchet.
There must be two of us.
They will take you for D'Artagnan.
We will spend the night in the Bastille.
Is Her Majesty never going to appear?
I told you all I know.
She sent word she is not feeling well.
Cystic food?
The supper is almost finished.
Well.
Maybe when the dancing begins.
Dancing.
I have a little gift for her.
When she does appear, Your Majesty,
Without sign of 12 studs that were your gift to her.
Can I ask her who stole these from her?
I am ready now.
But Your Majesty, without the jewels you can't...
D'Artagnan!
The jewels, Madame.
I suspected you might have some need for jewels, Your Majesty.
And so I...
I am heartbroken, Louis.
I had no time to display the jewels properly.
My dressmaker arrived too late.
Your dressmaker,
Madame D'Artagnan no doubt.
But I am all confused.
Where did you get those two studs?
He said they were stolen.
Our great Prime Minister reduced to stealing?
Perhaps we better increase his allowance.
Yes.
You may give them to me just the same.
My profound compliments.
Dispose of them as you will.
Where can we go?
I can't leave the palace tonight.
Tomorrow, somewhere.
My gratitude.
I kissed the queen's hand.
Have you no higher ambitions?
Tomorrow night.
Eight o'clock as the hand sounds.
The end of the flowers.
All the things
I go through for you, master.
No sooner they let me out of the Bastille.
And here I am, wearing your clothes.
I almost prefer the Bastille.
Ah Planchet, we must be careful.
Maybe Richelieu plans revenge.
If we run into an ambush, surely his men must mistake you for me.
Oh yes, that's true.
What are you saying, master!
Hahaah!
You may hang me if you desire.
But call upon you to witness that I surrender freely, voluntarily of my own choice.
Because I cannot stomach the kind of justice that takes the woman and lets the man go free.
The man surpasses even your description of him.
It's unbelievable.
You will release mademoiselle Borassieu.
I bargain with you sir, my life for hers.
Why should I want your life?
You don't want me?
Of course I want you.
I want you as a lieutenant in my guard.
Young man, I can't afford to have you as my enemy.
It's true.
You bring the affairs of state to a complete halt.
But hang you?
What a waste.
Now a man like you D'Artagnan brings out but one thing in me, my inquisitive instinct.
Monsieur, I...
You are an ambitious man or you would not have come to Paris.
May I suggest that in your legions to the throne you have joined your ambitions with a falling style.
Monsieur, I did not come here to pair you.
I came here about a certain young Lady.
Yes.
Why don't we speak of her another time.
Some time perhaps after you have accepted my commission.
The countess De Winter.
Over here, you two haven't met.
The Countess De Winter.
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Or have you met?
I am extremely interested in this young man, my Lady.
I wonder if you would be so good as to entertain him.
Give him a glimpse perhaps of the kind society that will be his.
If he accepts a lieutenancy in my guard.
Athos!
Aramis.
Porthas!
Careful, my friend Albert has a very tender butt.
Aramis, they told me you went to a monastery.
I thought I would not see you again.
It has only been a few days.
A great deal could happen in a few days that can change a man's life.
It seems, my friends, I am prepared to increase the life of the stage.
I expected you at any time to be joining me in the Bastille.
Richelieu took Constance in stead.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Richelieu knows.
Rochefort.
Countess De Winter, I think.
Oh, the famous countess De Winter...
Has anybody actually met her?
Yes, I have been seeing quite a bit of her lately.
Gentlemen. Don't misunderstand me.
I love Constance.
How I love her.
My time with my Lady is spent in polite conversation.
Don't you believe me?
He makes love to one woman in order to make love to another one.
Gentlemen, all I want form my Lady is her confidence.
You don't believe me.
We spoke of horses and gaskets.
The woman most notorious woman in France.
The woman that not even Buckingham could resist.
The most dangerous, fascinating, appetizing, tantalizing.
And all he wants is her confidence.
I only see my Lady to find out where Constance is.
Poor Constance.
Fifty francs he is in love with his Lady by the end of the week.
You swine. He doesn't know what it is to be in love.
When a man is in love he is safe from anything.
You country boy.
You know I almost believe him.
Fifty francs by the end of the week?
I almost believe him, but not fifty francs worth.
You're all poor, corrupt creatures.
Well, you'll see.
She hasn't the slightest appeal for me.
Although if I had some slight appeal for her
I might find out where Constance is.
But my Lady despises me.
She considers me a bore.
Oh, and worse, she is in love with another man.
Desperately.
All she can think of is...
Where is he?
Why doesn't he come to see you?
I have made so little progress.
I have been introduced to her maid.
Don't tell me you are making out with her maid.
Delicious, delicious.
No, no, my relation with Kitty, it's only to intercept her correspondence with this other man.
My God D'Artagnan. How can you be mixed up with so many different women and still be in love with somebody else?
My poor freckled friends.
You'll never understand.
Wait, if all you do care about is Constance, why don't you deliver this other man.
Surely the Countess confides in him.
Excellent, excellent.
Except that the other man unfortunately, is a count De Wardes.
Whom I left in Port Calais in very poor condition with four swords through his body.
How can fate be so cruel!
Cruel faith.
Why don't you kiss me?
Kitty, my precious, my beloved, my all...
Oh, you do not care about me.
All you care about is my mistress.
Well, she doesn't care about you.
This is the man she's in love with.
The count De Wardes.
Oh, I have to take that to him.
I have been taking letters to his house for days now.
He never answers.
Well, of course he doesn't, he is not at his house.
How do you know?
He is a good friend of mine.
Here, let's see what it said.
Oh, give it to me, give it to me.
Oh, I'm not...
My undying love, my...
Oh, you're right, Kitty.
She does love him.
My, my, why don't you answer my letters?
Come to me. I beg...
I wonder...
Could I do it?
I want it! Please!
Give me the letter.
Kitty, this man De Wardes, if she wants to find him, I must.
Oh Kitty, stop squealing,
I'm only trying to help you.
Look, you tell your mistress you delivered the letter.
But I didn't.
Never mind that.
Tell her the count begs forgiveness, but he is in hiding.
He is in trouble with Richelieu.
It was through him that monsieur D'Artagnan got to England and that Richelieu has given out an order for his arrest.
Is this true?
Well, more or less.
More or less.
And then tell your mistress that the Count De Wardes will call on her tonight at midnight.
Well, but on one condition.
That there is no light burning anywhere in the house.
No lights?
Oh, but if he is recognized by one person he is lost.
Tell her that he's afraid of running into the terrible,
D'Artagnan.
Oh I don't understand, I...
I mean... suppose he doesn't come and then she'll be angry with me.
Kitty, don't worry.
Didn't I say he will come; he is a friend of mine.
Yes
But you said he was afraid.
Kitty, my darling, my precious, my darling.
There, there, now run along.
And don't forget
Tonight at midnight.
And no lights!
Every light, Kitty. Hurry.
Yes, my Lady.
Oh, this is insane.
I could just as well pull the drapes, no one could see.
Kitty, did he act insane?
No, my Lady.
Well, never mind. Every light.
If he doesn't come...
If you have made a mistake...
Kitty, the wine is warm from the fire.
Take it. Chill it.
And the chocolate.
It's cold, warm it.
But there is no light in the house.
Do as I say!
Put out the light!
Monsieur D'Artagnan!
Where is my Lady?
In there.
Where is the count De Wardes?
Is the room dark?
There is a fire.
They're eatring by fire light.
A fire? But I said no light.
But it's only a little fire.
You can't see a thing.
You better be right about that.
Why i don't understand.
I don't understand one thing.
Uh. Kitty.
Now go in and announce me as the count De Wardes.
The count...!
Come, come, Kitty.
This is no time for weak nerves.
Go, go, go.
The count De...
The count De Wardes.
Oh Constance, Constance.
Understand me.
This is just for conversational purposes.
De Wardes.
De Wardes, at last.
At last. How sweet to see you.
Supper, how nice.
Never mind about supper.
A man grows hungry, my Lady.
Oh, kiss me. Kiss me.
As part of me is going to be cremated, sitting so close to the fire.
Are you going to kiss me or aren't you?
Well...
Perhaps one little kiss.
I think I'll be wait... better eat supper.
Wake up, Athos.
Athos, wake up.
Oh no.
Come on, Athos, wake up.
And help me to compose a letter.
You wake me up?
It is not even noon yet.
This is no hour for composing letters and looking happy.
Will you stop looking happy?
Oh Athos, we judged her unfairly.
How can I describe her?
Who? Her lips, her throat.
Who? Open your eyes, so you can see who you're talking about.
My Lady.
I can't describe her very well.
It was dark.
She even gave me a ring.
You carnival fellow
I resent your tone, Athos.
You have fallen in love.
I tell you we judged her unfairly.
You know. There is a certain difficulty about this ring.
She gave it to me under the impression that I was De Wardes.
A man wants to be loved for himself and...
And that is why you got to help me to compose some kind of letter.
Give me that ring.
What is it?
What's the matter, Athos?
I don't understand you.
That's a very beautiful ring.
Yes.
It once was mine.
Athos, this is a cruel sort of joke.
There are things that a man doesn't joke about.
I know that ring if I found it in my grave.
It belonged to my family.
It was a wedding gift to my wife.
Your wife?
The countess De Winter.
Poor heaven, how could you play such a hideous trick on me?
How could you play such a trick on me?
On her shoulder, there is a brand.
A floury.
But of course, she wouldn't do that.
Oh, this is monstrous.
What kind of drunken fantasy is this?
My friend, believe me.
This woman is my wife.
I told you the story.
Of your friend.
No, no, of myself, of myself.
I lied.
I despise this woman.
She is evil, selfish.
She is death, she is poison.
You liar.
Why are you trying to turn me against her?
What's your purpose?
The words proclaim your lie.
When you told me the story, you told me you still loved her.
Are these the sentiments of a man who still loves a woman?
Oh you drunken fool.
Because you hate, all women must die?
Are you sure this is the count's real handwriting?
Oh yes, I intercepted that letter only today.
Aramis, you write with a fine hand.
My Lady, I find myself unable to come to you again this evening as promised.
Since my return from England
I have so many invitations of this kind on my hands that I am forced to regulate them a little.
When your turn comes again,
I shall have the honor to inform you of it.
I kiss your hands.
Now sign it De Wardes.
Well, she certainly can't be too fond of De Wardes now.
But Aramis?
What's going to make her fond of me?
You! Get out of my room!
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
He is waiting in the sitting room.
Get him out of the house.
Tell him I can't see...
No. No, wait.
Monsieur D'Artagnan, a famous swordsman.
Kitty, prepare me.
Monsieur D'Artagnan?
How handsome you are.
My Lady, beside you,
I am a sparrow.
Charming.
Oh my Lady.
I am overwhelmed.
I have no words.
It is needless for a man of action to have words.
My, what a strong hand.
It's yours.
Don't you think it is a little bright in here?
The light is still in my eyes.
Oh, if I had you in my arms.
My own arms.
I meant...
Tell me you love me.
If only my heart were free.
Free of anger.
Free of fear.
Fear?
Oh my Lady.
Whom are you afraid of?
What do I live for except your command?
What would you do to a man, who holds my life in bondage?
Who persecutes me?
Who viles me?
Soils my honor in both soul.
Lady.
Speak his name and you sentence him to death.
Count De Wardes.
Who?
Oh.
Oh yes, the count De Wardes.
You're afraid of him.
Well, my Lady.
Well, if you love me.
Well, that is not the question.
Do you love me?
Oh my Lady, to kill a man.
No matter my reputation,
I don't take killing lightly.
Why only yesterday you were cool to me.
Cool to you?
You never know the agony it caused me to sitting here cool.
While you talked about horses.
And I yearning to throw myself into your arms.
Oh, I can't believe this.
And after you had left.
I had to receive this filthy De Wardes.
To pretend that I feel.
My Lady.
Do I love you?
Like the stars at night.
The sun, the day, now, tomorrow, forever.
My heart is yours constantly.
Irrevocably yours.
And yours alone.
Whatever my reputation, monsieur D'Artagnan.
I don't take love lightly.
If I had only known.
Oh my Lady.
I am unworthy of you.
The things I have done and had to do.
It's unworthy of you.
Oh no, my Lady.
Let me put your heart at rest.
It was not the Count De Wardes you hate that came to you last night.
Oh, forgive me.
Forgive me.
I know you will.
Don't you think it's a little bright in here?
My Lady?
Oh, you foul, sickening...
Why will I take so little pleasure in wrestling with women?
I will kill you, kill you.
Why am I a woman?
Why haven't I the strenght?
D'Artagnan, you are destroyed!
Guards! Guards! Please!
Kill him! Kill him!
He does rather well for a farm boy.
So this is how he spends his time in polite conversation.
Shall we intrude?
She has promised to kill you.
She'll keep that promise if she can.
Beware D'Artagnan.
Beware of strange men in dark places.
And lonely roads.
That woman will destroy you because she must.
You know her secret; brand of a common criminal.
Flouris.
All I know is what I have done.
I'm unspeakable.
No.
Merely young.
You could be so much worse off.
She could be your wife.
Constance.
No. Isn't that a miracle?
The queen found me.
Oh my love.
Speak to me.
Darling, we have so little time.
Oh my angel of goodness.
Will you marry me?
Now, this instant.
I can't. There is no time.
Oh, you must.
The queen's carriage, it's coming for me.
She's sending me where
Richelieu can't find me.
I will follow you.
I do not even know where she is sending me.
Oh Constance, Constance.
Why don't we spend the time there is together?
For my sake.
I have to leave soon.
Where I'll be I don't know.
What may happen to you?
We don't know.
You are afraid, aren't you?
You know, you could be killed.
Now you know everything about me.
No, it's just that sometimes I know how young I am and know how much
I have to live for and...
I tremble, I...
I keep making mistakes that follow me through all my days.
The Lady?
If I can figure you, certainly she can.
Oh, you don't know her.
Oh, my darling.
Well, that's only the sun.
Yes?
Your carriage is here.
Where ever you are.
Where ever I am.
Your grace.
Welcome to Grandstone castle, mademoiselle.
You'll be safe here.
Thank you, your grace.
Within a few hours you will be separated from Richelieu by the most impenetrable of all barriers; the wall.
Fire!
Fire!
Attack!
Fire!
D'Artagnan, go back!
Tell His Majesty another road.
We'll hold this one as long as we can.
Come out!
That's no English voice.
We're Frenchman!
Come out, Frenchmen.
Identify yourselves.
Men of the King's musketeers, sir.
What are men of the King's musketeers doing in this vicinity?
Richelieu?
So I am going to have his Majesty on my hands soon.
If I let these men go, the news of this little expedition will reach His Majesty within the hour.
Musketeers.
I find my self abroad this dark night with insufficient escort.
Well, his Majesty has...
We're at your command, sir.
Good.
There is a village yonder with an inn called "Dragon Rouge".
One of you up front, two behind!
My own men will stand guard outside.
Give my trusted friends here a room downstairs with a decent fire.
Gentlemen, you may have my room.
I put in a new stove only this day.
Good.
And landlord, watch their door.
Let them out only in case of trouble.
Monsieur, would you be kind enough to inform me of the reason for the secrecy of this meeting.
It's imperative that no one suspects either that I had anything to do with your leaving.
I have arranged it therefor, that not long after
I go out of this building men will appear and kidnap you by force.
They will know that you are going willingly of course, so I advice you not to resist them.
They will put you on a boat.
By morning you will be in England.
You will then proceed to
Buckingham's headquarters at Grandstone castle, and appear before him.
Well, after the affair with the diamonds.
That's impossible.
It will help that Buckingham knows that at least you're in my complete confidence.
You will present yourself to Buckingham, my Lady, openly.
My negotiater.
My Lady.
Do I understand the great Richelieu is preparing to negotiate a peace?
You do, my Lady.
Buckingham is arranging an alliance with Spain.
With Austria and their reign.
If he is successful, then the days of my power and your affluence are numbered.
But what if he refuses to negotiate?
You disappoint me, my Lady.
We can't play for Gods if that is what he wants.
Of course Buckingham will refuse to negotiate.
Well, but then...
Well, you use your famous imagination.
Are you suggesting that
I have him assassinated?
I suggest nothing.
I merely rely on your imagination.
What are your terms?
I shall need something from you.
Of course.
In writing.
A carte blanche.
A carte blanche?
But you have my word.
In writing.
It is by my orders, for the good of the state.
That there has been some...
Richelieu.
This will be quite satisfactory.
Sst. Listen.
The rest is bargaining.
My terms are simple.
First, there is a certain estate in the vicinity of Lyon.
A barony.
It was renounced by its owner quite some years ago.
It now belongs to the throne.
I want that estate, and the title.
That's easily done, my Lady.
What else?
Second, and last...
I want the head of monsieur D'Artagnan.
Delivered to me preserved in a small box.
Oh no, my Lady.
As of yet I have not yet given up hope for him.
You may give up hope for him now.
His instructions were to let us out in case of trouble.
Nobody said we couldn't start it ourselves.
Quickly, there seems to be trouble!
Athos!
The bargain?
If he succeeds in England, she gets D'Artagnan's head.
No, wait.
You and Portas go back to camp with Richelieu.
Find D'Artagnan, bring him here by morning.
Leave the woman to me.
Tell Richelieu I'm scouting ahead.
What happened?
Where is the other musketeer?
I don't know what happened, monsieur.
Athos went on ahead.
He said he'd scout around.
This man...
I have a message from Richelieu.
All is quiet; you have nothing to fear.
Good.
Don't be afraid, Charlotte,
I can neither kill you nor take you away.
Your kidnappers in a few minutes would report to Richelieu either your corps or your disappearance.
You, my dear wife, thinking it's neither becoming nor believable.
Richelieu gave you a certain paper, a carte blanche.
Since I can not kill you,
I must at least have that paper.
You will give it to me, Charlotte, or I shall have to take it.
No!
Help! Don't hit me!
I'm the landlord.
Help. Help. Help.
What the hell? Stop it!
The Lady you're looking for is upstairs!
Your orders have changed however; she is not to be taken to the boat.
Athos?
Athos?
Water.
You could have at least used wine.
With the compliments and the apologies of the house.
A woman sending apologies to a man who has never appreciated landlords before.
D'Artagnan.
They have told you that?
Yes.
None of us can go to England.
We're soldiers.
If we're caught on English soil, we would be hanged.
I suggest Planchet go to Buckingham.
Planchet?
Hmm?
You're going to England.
Yes, master.
I'll get shot!
Unlikely.
I... get seasick.
Undoubtedly.
D'Artagnan.
Do you think that Planchet is a...
My faith in Planchet is my faith in a friend.
I will go, master.
Well, just so you'll have no difficulty in travelling.
Richelieu himself gives you his blessing.
Be back a week from today.
My friends will be in the French camp, but I may be in hiding.
If you fail, Richelieu may be wanting my head.
Now. Tell Buckingham...
That this same woman, who has been promised my master's head, has come to England, not to assassinate, uh, not to negotiate a peace, but to assassinate you.
Then imprison her, my master said.
This is one of Richelieu's tricks.
Bind her, chain her.
Surround her with guards.
Pick from your most trusted men.
She is evil herself.
Now can I go back to France?
How do I know you're not one of Richelieu's tricks?
Is there anyone in England who can identify you?
No, sir.
I uh...
Well?
Oh. My master says that you will know this.
This man has in his possession the diamond stud that you once stole from me.
But of course, your grace.
That he stole of me.
He was one of my servants.
Where have you been, Duvalle?
I have been trying to find you to have you hanged.
Hanged? Duvalle?
My name is Planchet.
My master is monsieur D'Artagnan.
Would you do me the favor of having this creature hanged?
Planchet.
Oh my sweet Planchet.
How is he?
How is he?
My Lady.
You are under arrest.
Countess De Winter, may I present to you your jailer, mademoiselle Bonnasieux?
You will have a company of guards at your disposal, my dear.
But you will be responsible for this woman.
You see you are a woman yourself and save them all from obvious temptation.
If she escapes you,
You must know that I will be her first victim.
And D'Artagnan, the man you love, the second.
I think you make a better jailer then any man in England.
Remove the prisoner.
I haven't come to the best news.
I haven't come to it yet.
Mademoiselle.
The Lady who lived downstairs.
The Lady you married.
Constance?
She's in England!
You saw her?
Right in the castle!
Oh, and the wit of that monsieur Buckingham.
You know, I had always thought
Englishmen weren't very bright.
Well you see, there was some question about who was to be the woman's jailer.
Never mind about that.
Tell me about my wife.
But that is what I am telling you.
He made the mademoiselle a jailer.
But that is a funny story.
Did I leave something out?
Planchet.
Did he trust the Madame to the mademoiselle herself?
Oh, there was to be soldiers.
He trusted Satan to an angel.
Planchet, saddle my horse.
D'Artagnan, you can't go to
England. You will be hanged.
Stop being overprotective.
You'll be a deserter. In France.
Right! I too then!
They didn't tell me you were sick.
Let me address you.
No.
I will call the surgeon.
No!
I forbid it.
Believe me.
Pray for me. You're young.
You're good.
He will listen to you.
He won't listen to me.
Pray that I die.
Is that what you have been praying for?
To die?
Yes.
I'll call the surgeon.
No! Pray for me, that's all.
Of all you I pray.
Leave me.
Leave me.
Madame, call the surgeon?
She won't let me.
There is nothing wrong with her.
She's just pretending.
She knows that if I call the surgeon, he will find out.
Yes.
It's Alvin of the guard
I brought you your lunch.
Mercy.
Mercy, let me die.
Let the surgeon see you.
Let the surgeon see me?
Let Buckingham know?
He'll hang me.
Tomorrow, today.
But I trust you.
To be hanged.
A common criminal.
An Englishman knew...
Have I ever lied to you?
Have I ever pretended to be anything but what I am?
No.
Your D'Artagnan.
I kill him in an instant.
And Buckingham, that swine, I...
I am who I am.
And I have no concerns with your silly right's and wrong's.
But heaven, heaven may I not have pride?
Must I die at the hand of an Englishman?
I won't tell, I swear.
A knife.
Don't you?
Are you merciful or are you not?
It will save me.
Bring me a knife.
Let me end this.
I don't understand why he is torturing me.
Oh, I can't endure.
Oh, I can't.
Here is home, there is England.
I am mademoiselle Bonnasieux.
I am in charge of a certain person.
I am sick.
I can't take further responsibility.
His grace cannot be disturbed.
Oh, but I must see him.
Tomorrow perhaps.
I will give him the message.
She is laying on the floor.
She's all doubled up like...
Madame,
I take my orders from you.
But you are no officer and I can tell you this:
We don't treat no dog in England like you are treating her.
I am getting the surgeon.
No.
Are there any other guards on duty?
Yes, madame.
Send them away.
But...
You stay by her door.
Close the peephole.
I will be with my Lady in a few minutes.
But I forbid you to watch or have anybody else around.
Yes, Madame.
Will you send for the surgeon?
I don't think that will be necessary.
My Lady.
I... I brought you a book.
Lieutenant St. Clair, returning from France.
I have urgent dispatches for his grace, directly for your lord, the Duke of Buckingham.
I have to report to the captain of the guard.
Follow me sir.
Go! Go!
Guards! Guards!
Follow me!
Frenchmen in the castle!
Fire! Fire! Officers!
You are mademoiselle Bonnasieux.
You came earlier I believe.
His Grace was disturbed by your message and asked that if you returned, you'd been admitted.
Let her go.
Frenchmen in the castle.
Report to your corporal.
Yes sir!
Which way is the prisoner's quarter?
Up the stairs.
His grace has been murdered.
Lord Buckingham has been murdered!
Frenchmen in the castle!
Frenchmen in the castle, follow me, men!
Guards, guards!
Guards!
Guards!
Athos!
Constance. My wife.
My wife.
My Constance.
We will never have time.
Oh yes, my love.
Yes, we have time.
Of course we will have time.
Now look at me.
Look at me.
Keep looking at me.
You and I.
We will have everything you ask for.
Time to be in love.
Hold me.
Oh heaven, let me be strong enough for two of us.
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
We will only have a few seconds and they will come in this room.
We have no Buckingham to protect us now.
D'Artagnan,
You must come there is nothing more you can do.
Listen to me!
De Winter is still alive!
Catch them! Catch them!
I advise you D'Artagnan,
Try to lose yourself on the road to Spain.
Richelieu has given orders for your arrest.
As for the woman, forget her.
You ask the impossible.
This woman has assassinated the Prime Minister of England, murdered D'Artagnan's wife.
What do you propose to do?
Find her.
We lost her somewhere on the road to Lille.
We merely asking you, has she been in Paris?
Athos, this woman is protected by Richelieu.
If you touch her.
Gentlemen, are you aware of what will happen to you?
To all of you?
We are.
Leave her.
I beg of you.
Leave her to the justice of the state.
When there is no justice in the state.
If you come to terms in Paris
The road to Lyon.
Athos, remember the night you said when she was bargaining?
Lyon, an estate near Lyon?
A Barony?
She demanded the estate, and the title.
Is this more or less beautiful than Gastonny,
I wouldn't know.
Here I grew up.
These woods, these hills.
All this was mine.
And more D'Artagnan, more.
Here I fell in love.
Is it she?
Yes.
Well Athos, in a matter of hours, we will be on the road to Spain with a price on our heads.
Will we live to see France again?
Will we live to see Spain?
No!
No!
No!
No!
This was my family's chapel,
Charlotte.
You remember we took our vows here?
I loved you, Charlotte.
I still love you.
I loved you as
I loved war.
I love you as men love all there is, wishful.
Don't kill me, Robert.
Before God and this Holy place
I swear, I swear.
The executioner of Lyon.
Mercy.
You can not... gentlemen.
Mercy.
How many times have you asked for mercy and you received it?
And then repaid it in blood?
How many times have you taken a man's love, their pity, their aspirations?
And their lives?
What has been the essence of your evil?
If you would understood goodness.
We don't forgive you, Charlotte.
We can't.
We do not dare.
My wife.
They should remember you here,
Athos.
I advertise anyway.
Food landlord.
And wine landlord.
In the King's name!
The King's musketeers?
Yes, Monsieur Athos.
The best food and wine for Monsieur Athos.
This is a trap!
Athos! Chandelier!
D'Artagnan!
D'Artagnan!
Athos, hurry!
We have come to a time of peace,
Your Majesty.
The queen has returned from
La Rochelle. The war has ended.
Let the dead be dead and forgiven.
Forgive these men Sire.
I hear their resignations from the musketeers.
Aramis will embrace the life of the spirit.
Portas, I believe he states his intention, or at least his ambition, to marry a rich widow.
D'Artagnan returns to Gastonny.
Athos to the province of his birth.
Grand them peace Sire.
And forgiveness.
It was I who should be forgiven.
I have forgiven treason and arsony and because I admire an honest cutthroat as much as any man.
But with the murder of the Countess De Winter these men have set themselves above the state.
And she assassinated Buckingham.
You know that, and I know it too.
It was a hideous crime, no matter who was responsible.
But I...
I am the state, Your Majesty.
And I say it now privately.
So that we have no need to discuss it in public.
In France I am the state.
These men have set themselves above me.
And it is I, not you who render judgement.
I render their judgement now.
What have you there?
It is by my order and for the good of the state.
That the bearer of this has done what he has done.
Signed Richelieu.
That's a forgery.
This isn't theirs!
I gave this paper to...
To whom, Richelieu?
Did I understand that you were about to render a royal judgement?
In my humble capacity as the throne's
Prime Minister, your Majesty.
I was about to offer my suggestions.
That we allow monsieur Aramis to enter a monastery.
That we discover it possible to find a rich widow formonsieur Portas.
That we restore to the Baron de la Flair, if he wishes them, his land, his title.
And as for monsieur D'Artagnan.
Don't let him go back to Gastonny.
Send him perhaps on a mission of peace to England.
The English lead to dull a life.
Dismissed!
Cheeta!
Cheeta!
I knew where I'd find you.
Couldn't you hear me calling you?
Come on, Tarzan's waiting.
We don't have much time left.
All right, if you don't come right away, we'll leave you behind.
- Are we ready to leave, Tarzan?
- Leave soon.
- That's what you said before.
- Tarzan still say "ready soon."
Maybe Jane will be in Randini before we get there.
Boy glad Jane come home?
I can hardly wait to see her again.
Tarzan feel just like Boy.
But Tarzan work, not talk.
I worked too.
I cleaned up the house as you told me to.
And I watered the garden.
I even put flowers in all the rooms...
...the way Jane likes.
- Boy sweep floor?
Oh, I forgot that.
Well, do it right away.
Hurry, leave soon.
We're leaving now, Cheeta.
All right then, when Jane asks for you...
...I'll tell her you'd rather stay and fish than go and meet her.
So long, Buli.
Cheeta!
Cheeta!
All right then, how big was he this time?
I don't know why, Cheeta, but since you've taken up fishing...
...you've become an awful liar.
Hey, cut it out, Cheeta.
Boy look mad.
Can't a fellow think when he wants to without being interrupted?
Boy think too much.
Forget to laugh.
What Boy think so much about?
Oh, everything.
Everything Jane wrote about in her letters.
Tall buildings.
Trees taller.
Buses and streetcars that take you anywhere you want to go.
Buses never come.
Streetcars always late.
People get mad.
I guess it will take Jane months to tell us...
...all about the wonderful things she's seen.
There they go, Tarzan.
Geese are flying to lake where river starts.
You've never taken me hunting there.
Boy big enough now.
After Jane come back,
Tarzan and Boy go hunting.
Did you hear that, Cheeta?
I got the leader.
Beginners always lucky.
Supposing they've flown away by the time we get back from Randini?
Geese not in hurry like Boy.
- Is she dead?
- Girl be all right.
Where does she come from?
From behind mountains.
Tarzan, you never told me anybody lived there.
Girl not frightened, Tarzan friend.
Panther dead. Others gone.
Cheeta, give bracelet back to Girl.
Why Girl leave Palmyria?
Girl go back to people now.
Ankle hurt?
Tarzan take Girl back.
Oh, no, you mustn't.
Boy and Cheeta wait at raft.
- Can't we come with you, Tarzan?
- No.
- But Tarzan...
- Boy and Cheeta wait at raft.
Tarzan back soon.
I wonder why Tarzan never told us about Palmyria.
Come on, Cheeta.
Look, Cheeta, there's Tarzan.
And I thought I'd seen everything.
No, Cheeta, we'd better get back to the raft.
Throughout the history of our land, our Sun God...
...strangers centering their domain...
...have ever sought to despoil
Palmyrial treasures...
...we dedicate to thy glory.
For the protection of us, thy servants...
...thou hast ordained...
...that all such intruders shall forfeit their lives.
Grant me the strength...
...to carry out...
...this, thy sacred decree.
So Athena has taken it upon herself...
...to defy the wishes of the Sun God.
Forgive me, my queen, I meant no harm.
I grew restless to find out what lay beyond the mountains.
So restless that you forgot...
...that no one is allowed to leave or enter our sacred domain?
Please spare this man's life.
He saved mine.
- I pleaded with him not to come but...
- You need not plead for Tarzan.
He is our friend.
Nor should you seek pardon from me...
...but rather beg forgiveness from the sacred Sun...
...the Snake and the ever-living tree...
...for placing the safety of Palmyria in jeopardy.
Queen make wise laws.
Girl will obey.
May the great Sun God protect you on your way, Tarzan.
It was fortunate indeed...
...that it was Tarzan who found you...
...for he has known the secret of our hidden land...
...and kept it well.
You know, Tarzan, if I had a boy...
...I'd want him to know everything I know.
Tarzan doesn't want to hear any more about Palmyria.
- But, Tarzan, I...
- Boy talk too much.
Boy forget about Palmyria.
What's it say, Splivens?
That there steamer from England docked at Saxford 11 a.m.
Looks like a bit of alright,
Mr. Ballister, don't it?
You know, there might be some whiskey on board.
And there's a party of five coming on the dinghy.
- Who are they?
- Archaeologists, I think.
Archaeologists?
- I'll settle for the whiskey.
- Yes, sir.
What do they think they'll find in this hellhole?
If there's anything to be exploited here,
I'd have done it years ago.
That's right, if there was anything to be exploited around here...
...you would have done it years ago.
Come back here with that mirror.
Cheeta.
Give it to me.
Shame on you, always stealing things.
Hello, Tarzan.
- Thanks.
- Ship come in yet?
Dinghy's bringing the passengers up the river now.
Good. Cheeta stay here.
Boy and Tarzan go meet Jane.
Come, Boy.
One more bend and you'll see Randini.
Glad to be home, Jane, aren't you?
Is this all the speed you can get out of this ocean greyhound?
She's old, ma'am.
She wants to take it easy.
I only hope they got word to Tarzan in time.
Tarzan.
Boy.
My, how you've grown.
Excuse me.
Tarzan, this is Sir Guy Henderson.
- Mr. Anders.
- Glad to know you.
Mr. Brenner.
Mr. Lateur.
And Mr. Basov.
I'm very glad to meet you, Tarzan.
Jane has told us so much about you that I almost feel I know you.
Sir Guy was one of my father's very best friends, Tarzan.
- Jane's friends, Tarzan's friends.
- Thank you.
Oh, I can't get over how big you are.
- And I can swim as well as Tarzan now.
- Really?
Well, almost.
I'll prove it to you.
He swims like a fish.
Nothing is more inaccurate than to compare...
...the aquatic locomotion of a human being with that of a fish.
Hurry up, don't you ever want to get to shore?
Boy, right. Boat slow.
Tarzan and Jane swim to Randini.
But, Tarzan, don't be silly.
I can't swim like this.
No, you don't, no, Tarzan.
Make her get in, Tarzan.
What a family.
No, Tarzan, don't.
Tarzan!
When you told us about Tarzan and Boy,
I thought you were exaggerating.
I'm afraid I'll have to get used to this all over again.
Boy good swimmer. Crocodile better.
Tarzan best swimmer.
There.
Cheeta.
Gentlemen, this is Cheeta.
A magnificent specimen of chimpanzee syndactylous.
The magnificent specimen seems to be allergic...
...to zoologists and taxidermists.
- Hello, Mr. Ballister.
- Welcome home, Jane.
Thank you.
I see you all arrived safely.
What is it, Cheeta? What is it?
Gentlemen, I'm in charge of this post.
Welcome to Randini.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
What have you got there, Cheeta?
Why, thank you, Cheeta.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Gentlemen...
...look at my coming-home present.
Looks like coming home was worthwhile.
Might I?
It's beautiful.
I've seen this design before, somewhere.
The sun, a tree, a snake.
Have you run across anything like this in your travels, Anders?
Wonderful craftsmanship.
No, I haven't.
What does our eminent mineralogist make of it?
Unalloyed gold, unquestionably.
Oh, isn't it lovely?
I wonder where Tarzan got it.
How Jane get this?
Why, Cheeta gave it to me.
- I thought it was from you.
- Cheeta.
Where does the bracelet come from,
Tarzan?
Can it possibly be the work of a native tribe?
- Jane, Tarzan go home now.
- But, Tarzan...
Sun getting low in sky.
Jane come with Tarzan.
I don't understand.
There must be something wrong.
- Don't worry, Jane.
- Jane.
Well, goodbye, gentlemen and good luck.
Goodbye.
Basov, be a good chap and get me the case...
...with the reference books, will you?
- Gladly, sir.
This is it.
"Vase.
Exact origin unknown...
...believed to have originated with an obscure tribe...
...in the interior of Africa.
Composition: Cloisonné and unalloyed gold.
Date unknown.
Owner, British Museum."
The sun, a tree, a snake...
...I knew I'd seen that design before.
The design is identical.
Can you throw any light on this,
Mr. Ballister?
Ever since I took over this post,
I've heard rumors among the natives...
...about a fabulously wealthy tribe led by women.
Yes, but we don't hold with fairytales like that.
You keep your ugly face out of this.
That's right.
I investigated thoroughly...
...strictly in the interest of science of course...
...but these natives are a surly and superstitious lot.
Yes, and that ain't the half of it.
You say these rumors indicate the tribe is led by women?
Amazons.
- Amazons?
- This is too good to miss.
Think of it. Think what it would mean if we were the first to discover this tribe.
Searching for glory, eh?
You wouldn't welcome an opportunity like this?
Naturally, I would.
From a scientist's point of view, the discovery might be of great importance.
Well, then, gentlemen, since we're all agreed.
Not so fast, Mr. Ballister.
This expedition was organized with the specific intention...
...of further investigating certain tribes north of the Kaisoot.
So you're willing to play second fiddle to Young and Goodheart and the others...
...when the chance to make a real discovery falls into our laps.
Well, maybe Sir Guy doesn't like the idea of facing hardships.
Have you any natives around here...
...who could serve as guides if we should make the attempt?
I wouldn't put any trust in the natives.
They're so blinking superstitious.
There's only one man for this job:
Tarzan.
That's right. But will Tarzan tell you?
He'll tell us all right.
How soon can you get this safari in shape?
First thing in the morning.
Then, gentlemen, we better be turning in. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
You won't regret it, Sir Guy, however much you scorn fame.
Pure gold.
Our home.
Trees, bridge.
Every time I wanted to be with you,
I just closed my eyes and there it was.
It's just the way you left it. I cleaned and scrubbed it, didn't I, Tarzan?
Wait until I get my hands on you.
You'll be sorry, every one of you.
Come on, Cheeta.
Look what they've done to my clean house.
Never mind, Boy.
I'll have it fixed up in no time.
Very clever, these monkeys.
Cheeta not nice to little cousin.
- Come, Boy, lots of work.
- Oh, now, never mind, never mind.
You men go out and get the rest of the luggage. This is my job. Go on.
I'm sure glad Jane's back. Now we're gonna have some real cooking again.
Boy always say Tarzan's cooking good.
Well, it wasn't so good sometimes.
Tarzan bad mother, good father.
Tarzan.
I'm all out of breath.
Jane take deep breath and close eyes.
Tarzan thought Jane never come back.
Being away is a lot harder than staying behind.
Very lonely without you.
Or without you.
Jane not angry with Tarzan?
No, Tarzan. Why should I be angry?
Jane seemed unhappy because Tarzan took bracelet away.
No, Tarzan.
You must have a good reason.
It was beautiful and I thought it was my coming-home present.
I was just a little disappointed.
- Was she pretty?
- Who?
The girl you rescued from the panther.
Oh, beautiful.
No, he wasn't quite as tall...
...and his shoulders were a little narrower...
...but he had the nicest smile.
- Who?
- Oh, didn't I tell you?
An officer I met on the boat.
Cheeta been fishing two years, no fish yet.
You can keep your blasted jungle.
Give me Hampstead Heath.
If only 10 percent of what we heard is true, you'll have nothing to kick about.
Well, I hope as how you got your information from headquarters.
I only had room for a few books, so I chose them very carefully.
Jane right, book only as good as what it say.
I like this one best of all.
Strong of arm was Hiawatha
He could shoot ten arrows upward
Shoot them with such strength
And swiftness
That the tenth had left the bowstring
Ere the first to earth had fallen!
Good, good. How Boy learn so quick?
I just read it over a few times.
Anybody could learn it.
You try it, Tarzan.
Swift of foot was Hiawatha
Swift of foot was...
- Swift of foot was...
- Hiawatha
Swift was...
Tarzan mind not so swift.
Even if you can't say it like Hiawatha, you can sure shoot like him.
Forth into the forest straightway
All alone walked Hiawatha
Proudly, with his bow and arrows
And the birds sang round him, o 'er him
"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"
Up the oak tree, close beside him
Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo
In and out among the branches
Coughed and chattered from the oak tree
"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"
But the part I like best of all is where he wants to kill a deer.
The buck comes along...
...and Hiawatha aimed an arrow.
Scarce a twig moved with his motion
Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled
How's about taking a snapshot of me with this here lioness, Mr. Anders?
Why not?
- Could I borrow that gun just a moment?
- Watch it, it's loaded.
This ought to make my old lady sit up and take notice.
This is not my idea of sport,
Mr. Ballister.
Why don't we all sit down and have a good cry?
I didn't do it, Tarzan.
Honestly, I didn't.
It was Ballister what shot it.
She was about to attack.
I think anyone would have done the same thing.
Mother lion never attack unless somebody after cubs.
The only excuse we can offer is it was done in the excitement of the moment.
Oh, Jane.
Every time men bring guns, men bring trouble.
We're sorry, believe me.
I thought you'd planned to go north,
Sir Guy.
Yes, so we had, but something rather exciting cropped up...
...and we changed our plans.
Suppose we talk this over in the morning when things have calmed down.
- Why men not tell why men here?
- What do you mean?
Men come to get Tarzan's help.
It's refreshing to find someone who comes right to the point.
Tarzan answer, like men say, right to the point: No.
Tarzan better take cubs before cubs attack people.
Well, looks like we better set up camp.
All right, boys, start pitching camp.
This change in your plans, Sir Guy...
...in what way could it require
Tarzan's help?
You remember the bracelet you received at Randini?
- Yes.
- A simple gold bracelet.
And it's opened up a world of infinite possibilities.
- What are you doing?
- I'm shooting the sun.
Shooting the sun?
Just an expression, we are trying to find out where we are.
Why? Don't you know where you are?
Hey, what are you doing?
Give me that.
Get out of here! Go on out of here!
Beat it!
Now we'll see how pure it is.
But you can see there's nothing in it.
Boy, look.
Look in here.
It's all full of:
Now you can see why one must be careful.
What you just saw is nothing but harmless, one-cell life.
Jane!
Jane.
You must never drink another drop of water again.
- What?
- You should see what I just saw.
Why, it's full of terrible-looking animals.
He must have looked through
Basov's microscope.
Darling, there are so many things you don't know.
And according to Tarzan's philosophy, what you don't know won't hurt you.
Believe me, Jane, if it were only for self-glory...
...it would be a different matter.
But the discovery of this tribe will be a real contribution to science.
Tarzan is the only man who can lead us there.
You must do everything you can to make him see it our way.
As a rule, it isn't a simple matter to change Tarzan's mind.
He usually has a reason for his actions.
I'm sure I can persuade him to see it your way, Sir Guy.
- Good.
- I'll try too.
Oh, thank you, young man.
- What's wrong?
- Monkey's got a stick of dynamite.
- She'll blow us all sky-high!
- Cheeta!
Here, Cheeta, give it to me, Cheeta.
You nearly had the magnificent specimen ready for your collection this time.
Yes, in small pieces.
- That was a close one.
- You dropped this, Mr. Anders.
- Oh, thank you, Boy.
- How do you work it?
You come around anytime,
I'll be glad to show you.
- I think we better be leaving now, Boy.
- Goodbye.
Jane...
...we're depending on you.
I developed it all by myself.
Then Mr. Anders enlarged it for me.
They've opened up a whole new world for you, haven't they, Boy?
Mr. Anders said I could keep this until they go away.
They're really powerful. Did you see what Mr. Splivens gave Cheeta?
- No.
- A magnifying glass.
Now, what would Cheeta want with a magnifying glass?
Just like he said,
"I hopes as how it'll come in handy."
Look how close it brings the mountains to us.
But that's nothing, you ought to see Mr. Basov's telescope.
It brings the sky right down to the treetops.
Boy know every star in sky like friend.
Yes, Tarzan, but this telescope brings them so close.
- You can almost shake hands with them.
- Almost.
You mustn't try to discourage Boy.
It may be years before anyone comes...
...who can teach him the things these friends of mine can.
Friends help Boy change Tarzan's mind and lead safari.
- Oh, now, that's silly.
- Why men stay here then?
They hope when you understand the object, you'll see reason and help them.
Yesterday Tarzan say no.
Today Tarzan say no.
- Tomorrow Tarzan say no.
- Why won't you help them, Tarzan?
- Not good for men to look into sun.
- What's the sun got to do with it?
Sun like gold.
Too much sun make people blind.
Well, now you're talking in riddles.
If you could just give us one good reason for your refusal.
Jane tell men Tarzan say no.
All right, I'll have to tell Sir Guy that you refuse to change your stubborn mind.
- I'll come with you, Jane.
- I don't think Tarzan would approve.
You might be in danger of learning something.
Boy, soon as men leave,
Tarzan and Boy go hunting.
All right, boys, lay off.
We've gotta break camp.
It's a blooming shame, I told youse what Tarzan wouldn't tell us.
I've had about enough out of you.
I must admit, it is a considerable letdown.
Let me remind you, gentlemen...
...that I have no less interest in this discovery than yourselves.
If anyone can offer a practical solution,
I shall be glad to fall in with it.
There's only one way to deal with a guy like Tarzan.
Well, Sir Guy, I take it you want us to step back into obscurity.
There was nothing obscure about the mission on which we came.
We'll follow our original plan and go north.
Boy, look, jungle water pure.
No bugs.
Boy look like thundercloud. Sick maybe.
Leave him alone, Tarzan. He feels badly because his friends are leaving today.
After safari leave, Boy will forget.
Hope they forget how you treated them.
Maybe Jane gone so long, forget not all men good.
What right have you to judge men who are trying to do something for the world?
You'd hold back the progress of civilization...
...simply because you've decided my friends aren't to be trusted.
Well, I trust them.
If I could think of any way to help them,
I certainly would.
Jane pretty when mad.
Cheeta like Jane, wanna set the world on fire.
Hello.
Hello, Boy.
We've come to say goodbye.
We'll miss you, Boy. I've never had a more promising apprentice.
Men wise to leave.
I like you, Tarzan, but you're as immovable as the Rock of Gibraltar.
It's insufferable to be on the brink of a discovery and to be turned back.
Not all discoveries bring happiness.
Personally, I refuse to be pacified by jungle platitudes.
You must admit, the world will hardly cease to revolve on its axis...
...because of our disappointment.
Get away!
- Well, goodbye, Jane.
- Good luck, Sir Guy.
- Goodbye, Tarzan.
- Goodbye.
Stick to your books, my boy.
He has a fine mind.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Tarangi, Tarangi, on your feet.
Boy, Tarzan keep promise, go hunting now.
I'm not going.
Tarzan wanna see Boy shoot leader of geese.
I don't wanna go.
Boy wanna go before strangers came.
They're not strangers.
They're Jane's friends and mine.
And they're leaving because of you.
I don't ever wanna go hunting with you.
- Tarzan, Boy, what's wrong?
- Tarzan go hunting alone.
Boy, what happened?
Oh, nothing.
Go on home, Cheeta. Leave me alone.
You know, Cheeta, sometimes I can't understand Tarzan.
"Boy forget about Palmyria.
Not good for men to look straight into sun."
Jane's right. Tarzan won't help them.
I will.
Come on, Cheeta.
- Are you sure you know the way, Boy?
- Of course I do.
What puzzles me, Boy, if you knew this all the time, why didn't you speak up?
I didn't realize I was holding back the progress of civilization.
Boy?
Boy.
There. Behind those mountains is Palmyria.
But how does one ever get across?
I know how.
I wonder what's keeping the others so long.
- You wait here. I'll see.
- Thank you, Boy.
Lateur, look.
I stake my reputation...
...that's the orchid Ponsonby claimed to have discovered last year in Brazil.
No, Mr. Lateur, don't step out there!
Don't, those flowers only grow over mud pits.
It's a lucky thing we have Boy to look after us.
Tarangi, Tarangi, what's holding things up?
That's the most cockeyed superstition
I ever heard of.
Who said you won't come back if you go across those mountains?
You'll do as I say.
- That's enough, telling them, governor.
- Pick up that stuff and get out of here.
Pick up that stuff.
Splivens, stop those guys. Stop!
Put that gun away, Ballister.
I'm in charge of this expedition.
Who's going to carry all this stuff?
We'll take only essential equipment.
All I'll need will be my camera and notebooks.
Yeah, only essential equipment.
Boy!
Boy!
Boy!
Paradise in the land of forgotten time.
Get a load of that. Makes your
Hampstead Heath look pretty cheap.
Makes you kind of goosepimply-like all over, don't it?
What was lovely from afar is still lovelier nearby.
- What's eating you?
- Nobody home. A bit eerie, ain't it?
Imagine architecture like this, here in Africa.
Yeah, look at that dome. That's gold.
We are friends.
Our mission is a peaceful one.
Odd form of welcome, huh?
May we greet the ruler of this beautiful land?
You and your companions were ill-advised to come here.
The law of Palmyria demands the penalty of death for all intruders.
We come not as intruders.
But as men of science, anxious to study the ways and the culture of Palmyria.
Are weapons of war implements of study?
We needed these to protect us in the jungle.
But we gladly place our weapons in your keeping until we leave.
Ballister.
You're a fool.
We could have shot our way out of here.
Even if you came with peaceful intent...
...how can we know that you would not spread the word...
...of our treasures to the outside world?
You have only my promise, but I give it sincerely...
...that if we are allowed to leave peacefully...
...no word of what we have seen shall be passed on to a living soul.
Wily old humbug, Sir Guy.
Humbug me eye. He means it.
The path to Palmyria is our most closely guarded secret.
How did you find it?
It's my fault. I led them here.
Who are you?
Boy, son of Tarzan.
Tarzan would never betray us.
Oh, Tarzan doesn't even know that I know the way.
My queen...
...this boy was with Tarzan when he rescued me.
Yes, and I followed them to the top of the mountain.
I have grown old in the service of my people and of the great Sun God.
Never before have I doubted the wisdom of his decrees...
...yet I know that he is not a god of vengeance.
He would not unjustly demand the death of peace-loving men...
...of good faith and an impetuous child.
Your lives will be spared.
It will be difficult not to tell the world of your generosity.
You will not need to suppress your impulse of gratitude.
You will never leave Palmyria.
A place will be found for you among the men who toil in our quarries.
The remainder of your days on Earth...
...will be dedicated to the service of the God...
...who mercifully spared your lives.
See that these men are sheltered in the city for the night.
Jane. Boy.
Jane. Boy.
Tarzan!
Tarzan!
Jane!
Riches enough to buy and sell a continent, and look at us.
Held prisoners by a bunch of women.
Whose habits bear a remarkable resemblance...
...to those of the black widow spider.
- That's right.
And we gave our guns up to them just like that.
Even if we could have shot our way out...
...I have a curious aversion to shooting women.
You may be content to spend your life...
...working for the glory of their almighty
Sun God and his pet snake.
But I love the idea of being handcuffed in a gold mine until we rot to death.
Cheeta, remember the girl
Tarzan rescued?
Go find her, bring her here.
Now it is confirmed that the matriarchal society...
...can and does exist in its purest form.
For heaven's sakes, what's the point of writing when no one's going to read it?
Hampstead Heath was never like this.
- Why did you send for me, Boy?
- You have to help us.
No, no, I mustn't.
I've caused enough trouble already.
- You've got to.
- But I can't.
Tarzan saved your life. The least you can do is to help us get out of here.
Cheeta, come on.
I shall lead you safely past the city.
You must be silent.
Discovery would mean instant death.
- But our weapons...
- They're in the palace.
You'll find them in the room behind the altar.
Get them as quickly as possible.
There's no time to lose.
Oh, wouldn't my old lady love this?
Incredible. The world won't believe me.
They'll believe me all right.
I'm gonna make this trip worthwhile.
Here, give me a hand.
I'm going to see what's keeping them.
Come on, Cheeta.
You greedy fools. Aren't you content to escape with your lives?
Shut up that preaching. Wrap that up.
I didn't bring you here to pillage like barbarians.
Take it easy, Sir Guy.
You'll wake up the whole neighborhood.
I order you to leave everything here.
We're through taking orders from you.
Don't touch that, Ballister.
Have you gone mad?
Sir Guy!
Sir Guy.
Mr. Anders, come quickly.
I should never have brought you here.
You killed him.
Now I know why Tarzan said it was not good for man to look straight at sun.
Stop sniveling. Get in there and help carry some of that stuff.
Get going.
- Pick that up.
- I won't.
Better do as he says.
And be quick about it.
You can go on your feet.
Duck, Mr. Splivens.
We'll never hold them back with one rifle. Looks like our number's up.
Oh, no, it ain't.
Come on. On your feet, chappy.
- I'm all right, go ahead.
- Hurry up, Splivens!
Look out, Mr. Splivens!
Mr. Splivens. Mr. Splivens. Mr. Splivens!
At noon the sun rising over the eastern mountains...
...will fully cover his own image with celestial light.
It is then that you will repay him with your life.
Boy.
- Boy.
- Boy all right. Jane not worry.
Why, it's Cheeta.
Cheeta, where Boy?
Cheeta, stay with Jane.
Now has everlasting evil fallen upon us.
The grass will wither...
...and the shadow of death will cover our fair land.
Never to be lifted until thy sacred symbols are returned to thee.
Anders, this is only the beginning.
I've never seen such wealth.
Now that we know the way, we'll be back.
All of it can be ours.
Pure gold. Look at it.
That means power.
Power to get anything you want.
Where's Boy?
Where's Boy?
Boy!
Tarzan.
Jane! Jane!
Boy!
Oh, darling.
Thank heaven you're both safe.
Throw it, Tarzan. Quick!
-The court is open.
-Yes, sir.
Captain Leland, this court has considered your case...
...and reached its conclusions based on evidence...
...introduced while you were present.
At the close of evidence, court was closed...
...and by secret ballot, in which two-thirds of the court concurred...
...the court reached its findings.
Which are, of all specifications and of all charges, guilty.
Then again, by secret ballot, in which at least two-thirds of the court concurred...
...the court decided your punishment.
Which is that you be sentenced to dismissal from United States Army...
...and forfeit all pay and allowances due or to become due...
...subject to approval of the reviewing authority.
-Any further business?
-No, sir.
Do l hear a motion for adjournment?
-l move that the court adjourn.
-l second the motion.
Any objections? Apparently not.
The court is adjourned to meet at the call of the president.
How about a game, fellows?
All right, Hanson.
You and me against Greer and Parsons. l´ll take a cue.
Well, captain...
...anything bothering you?
Used to be a custom in the British army when a man disgraced his uniform.
Too bad we can´t do it.
Come in.
Well, Rick?
An officer shouldn´t associate with one who´s been dishonorably dismissed.
The regulations say so.
The adjutant gave his permission. ln spite of the evidence, l just can´t believe.
Or if you did do it, you must have had a reason.
One that you thought was important.
Tell me. l´m your friend. lt´s all in the testimony. l could have loaned you the money, or part of it.
And there were others who would have been glad. l just can´t believe.
You, of everybody l know.
Yeah, l guess nobody ever really knows anybody.
What are you going to do, Rick? l´ll probably go up to Canada.
-They need artillerymen there.
-But, Rick....
Well, anyway, good luck.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
Sit down. l see you´re an artilleryman,
Mr. Leland.
What is your experience, and with what type or ordnance?
All types and calibers of both fixed and mobile coastal guns...
...including one year in an antiaircraft battery.
Where were you stationed?
Two years at Fort MacArthur, one year and eight months, Fort Totten...
...one and two months,
Fort Kamehameha...
...four years in the Panama Canal Zone.
Your full name?
Richard Loomis Leland.
-Richard Leland?
-That´s right, sir. l´m sorry, Mr. Leland, but l believe at this time...
...we have a full compliment of coast artillery officers of all ranks. l thought the Canadian army needed men of experience.
Oh, regardless of his qualifications, no one man is indispensable.
Maybe Chiang Kai-shek won´t be so particular. l´m aware neither of the desperation of the generalissimo´s needs...
...nor how good are his sources of information.
Good day, Mr. Leland.
Your baggage checks, Ms. Marlow.
The ship sails from Pier 1 9.
Sailing time will be midnight, but passengers be aboard by 1 1 :00, please.
Thank you.
What was that boat you were talking about?
The Genoa Maru, sailing tonight for Yokohama...
...by way of New York, the Panama Canal and Honolulu.
-lt´s for me.
-Excuse, please?
How much?
To port of final destination, $21 2.80.
Excuse, please. l cannot promise passage on the Genoa Maru...
...unless we have cancellation.
However, there is possibility. lf you will leave name and address, l shall inform you in time before sailing.
-Well, when is the next sailing?
-Next Wednesday.
The Nakimura Maru.
Bigger, more passenger space, same fare.
Well, try to make it Genoa Maru. l´ll be packed and waiting.
We trust we can be satisfactorily of service, Mr. Leland.
-Good night, Mr. Leland.
-Night.
This is Mr. Leland speaking.
The N.Y.K. steamship office call me?
You´re sure?
Well, thanks.
Yes?
Yeah. Yeah, speaking.
The Genoa Maru it is, eh?
Okay.
You send the tickets over, and l´ll pay the messenger.
Right.
-Passenger?
-Yes.
Bags, should-a be.
-What time do we sail?
-Soon.
Ten minutes or half-hour, should-a be.
Should?
-Leland Richard.
-No, Richard Leland.
Should-a be.
-Bed hard?
-lt´s very hard.
Should-a be.
My name Sugi. l think l´ll call you ´´Should-a Be,´´ if you don´t mind.
Should-a be.
For drink.
Wash hand.
Fan.
For read.
Anything else?
We´re going to know each other eventually, so why not now?
That seems reasonable enough. l´m Alberta Marlow.
My name´s Rick Leland.
Would you mind stepping into the light?
Please.
Well, on a Jap freighter too.
You´d better pinch me. l don´t think l know you that well.
A pretty girl on a boat with no college boys, no handsome officers...
...no eligible men of any description.
That´s wonderful.
You´ve traveled a lot?
Some, but never so luxuriously.
This is my first time on a big ship.
Well, this is not a ship.
This is a boat. ln Medicine Hat we wouldn´t know about such things.
That where you come from?
How far you going?
Through the Panama Canal to Los Angeles and then back home by train.
Vacation? l´ll try to make the trip as pleasant as possible.
Thank you.
-Good night, Mr. Leland.
-Well, now, don´t go.
Let´s go into the salon and talk.
Sorry. Hope l´ll see you around again soon.
We´ll probably bump into each other.
-Good night.
-Good night.
-Thick night out.
-Yes, sir.
Can´t open the liquor until you get outside the 1 2-mile limit?
That is so.
-Silly rule, huh?
-Yes, sir.
-Excuse, please. Yes, sir.
-Yes.
-l presume you´re Mr. Leland.
-That´s right. l´m Dr. Lorenz.
Not much chance of mistaking one´s fellow voyagers on this passage.
Not much.
-May l inquire where you´re bound for?
-The Orient.
Excellent. l too.
The Philippines, that is. l hold the chair of sociology at the university there.
My man. He doesn´t speak English.
That would be T. Oki of the passenger list? l take him everywhere.
The Japanese make great servants.
Will this be your first trip to the Orient?
Never been further than Hawaii. lndeed? l´ve lived and worked in the Far East going on 30 years.
Oh, that´s a long time.
The Oriental way of life holds a great appeal for me. l´m going to take a turn about deck before retiring.
-Would you care to join me?
-That´s a good idea.
-You´re an American, are you not?
-Yes.
Then you don´t share my enthusiasm for the Japanese. l don´t know.
Never thought about them.
Wonderful little people. Wonderful.
Greatly misunderstood, believe me.
To know them, that is...
...to really know them, is to feel the deepest affection toward them. l understand we have a charming young lady passenger aboard.
Yes. A creature of rare loveliness, doctor.
She walks in beauty. l´m a very, very happy man, but very.
-Usually on a freighter--
-But not this one.
A fellow couldn´t do half as well on a trans-Atlantic liner. l have no objection to your discussing me...
...but do you mind doing it farther off? l´m trying to sleep.
You´re fortunate. Fortunate and young.
Occasionally l wish l were young again.
-Good night.
-Good night, sir.
-Good morning.
-Mr. Leland.
-l hope and trust you had a good night.
-l don´t remember, so l must have.
You missed something sleeping so late.
We dropped the pilot.
Well, what l came to see l didn´t miss.
Are your legs always blue?
-They´re not blue.
-Should-a Be, give me that blanket. l don´t want a blanket. l want sunshine.
Your teeth are chattering like a crap game.
This is November, and it´s winter sunshine.
-Thank you.
-Well, it´s pure selfishness on my part. lf you catch pneumonia, what will happen to our romance?
What will happen to it if you don´t shave? l shall enjoy listening to you two if you´ll permit me.
You can referee.
Relationships between modern young Americans...
...seem most peculiar to a man of my years.
You give your lovemaking an assault-and-battery twist.
Living in the Far East has given me a more or less Oriental view of things.
We were discussing Philippine economics when we were interrupted.
My own field.
Ms. Marlow´s kind enough to listen to me.
They´re going to be free, aren´t they?
They are, provided America doesn´t insist on fighting a war with Japan. lt´s my opinion, however, that that contingency...
...is going to keep the Philippines from ever being free.
Won´t Japan gobble them up?
No offense, but Japan or Canada or anybody else can have the Philippines. lt´s hot in Manila. lt might be even hotter before long.
Hot enough to go around in shorts?
There´s a Canadian for you.
Let them take their clothes off, and they´re happy.
Look. An American warship.
Yes, a 1 91 8 Flush Decker.
Four four-inch .50-caliber guns, one three-inch .23-caliber antiaircraft gun.
Not very formidable.
Don´t you find that the United States is inclined to forget...
...that most of the world is at war already, with more war to come...
...perhaps in the Pacific?
Well, if it comes, it will have to do without me. lndeed, Mr. Leland?
You seem about the right age. l´ll see you later.
Very interesting young man.
Very. l don´t believe our captain will mind my explaining his words.
What he just said means,
´´Permit me to take.´´
Something like saying grace before a meal. lt also expresses his thankfulness to his ancestors.
That is right. Excuse, please. l like that. l come from a long line of grace-sayers.
Excuse, please. Ms. Marlow, Mr. Leland,
Chief Engineer Mitsuko.
How do you do?
Excuse, please.
Chief engineer has no English.
Chief engineer has a good grip.
Some joke.
No, l think l´ll skip the bread pudding.
Just bring me some coffee. l hope you´re a good sailor,
Ms. Marlow.
The Genoa Maru has her moments when a blow comes on.
-l wonder if it will really get rough.
-This is rough.
Not nearly enough. l wanna go through something l can talk about.
Yes, well, you probably will, but you may not wanna talk about it. l think there´s something elemental in a storm. lt appeals more to women than men.
They´re more elemental.
-Than what?
-Than women.
-Men?
-Than men.
Yes, l hope so, honey. l´m your friend.
Some joke. l suppose l shouldn´t smoke my cigar right now.
No, let her be happy for a little while.
A little while.
Do you know what l´d like to do?
To go up in the bow, if l had a man to hang on to. l´m your man.
Anyplace, even the crow´s nest.
Let´s go.
-Better bring your coat.
-Gentlemen.
Oh, this is wonderful.
What a figurehead you´d make.
Look at the stern, the way it goes up and down. lt goes down so far, you´d think it would never come up again.
-And look at the way the masts are going.
-Well, don´t look too long.
-Keep your eyes off the water below.
-Oh, l feel wonderful.
You are wonderful. l wish l had a better suit. lt doesn´t matter about the suit.
You have a kind face.
-You think so?
-Yes, l do, Rick.
-That´s the first time you called me Rick.
-ls it?
Yes.
What´s the matter?
Look, l didn´t mean that. l did. Why didn´t you?
Well, a fellow with a suit like mine shouldn´t go around kissing girls.
Hey, are you getting sick? l don´t know. How do girls usually act when you kiss them?
-Well, they don´t turn green.
-Then l´m sick. Get me out of here.
And everything was going so beautifully.
Why did you have to eat that bread pudding?
Should-a Be.
The lady´s been stabbed by a bread pudding.
-Do want you can for her.
-Bread pudding. Too bad.
Should-a be.
Mr. Leland.
You beating it?
Patience is a game one only plays out of boredom...
...which condition of mine it does nothing to relieve.
-Will you have a drink with me?
-Thanks. l will.
Have another. l shouldn´t. l´m strapped.
Sorry to hear that.
But what possible bearing can that have? lf a fellow l´m counting on in New York doesn´t kick through...
...l won´t be able to buy you a drink.
That doesn´t alarm me greatly.
Ms. Marlow dying. Want to see Rick.
Excuse me, l´ll be right back.
-l understand you´re dying.
-Yes.
Do you want to be buried at sea?
They stitch you up in a bag--
-No.
-And you wouldn´t like that?
-Then l´ll have Should-a Be put you on ice.
-Very amusing, a woman suffering.
Oh, stop being such a baby.
Even if l do live, l´ll never be the same again. lt happens to everybody that eats bread pudding and looks at a mast.
The mistake l made was in kissing you.
-l was all right till then.
-l resent that. l´ll never let you kiss me again.
We won´t argue. You´re not well, and you don´t know what you´re saying. l do too.
Stop that.
Don´t tell me you´re the kind that goes to bed with your shoes on. l need them on for when l suddenly have to run down the hall.
All right, darling.
-l´ll humor you.
-Humor me?
When you´re sitting at the table tonight, eating your head off...
...think of the girl whose happiness you wrecked.
-Yes, darling.
-l pity the woman you ever marry.
Oh, l´ll never get married.
The kind of a lover l am, it wouldn´t be fair.
Any wife of mine would spend her whole life running down hallways.
-You aren´t married, are you, Rick?
-No. Does that make you feel better?
You make me sick.
And if you stay here one minute longer, l´ll prove it to you. l take it our lovely traveling companion has a touch of mal de mer. lt was only a matter of time.
She speeded things up by looking at the mast.
-What a pity.
-Yeah.
She doesn´t look too well with a green face.
From certain remarks you dropped on deck this morning, Mr. Leland...
...l gather you are quite well informed in matters pertaining to the U.S. Navy.
Yes, l know a little bit about it.
You were, perhaps, in the Navy?
No. Coast artillery. Army.
How interesting.
Not so interesting.
Were you ever stationed in Panama?
Part of the time. l hope you don´t think l´m too inquisitive.
Not at all. Not at all.
You´re furnishing the liquor.
That´s hardly an excuse for asking a man his history. l haven´t got any history. l was in the Army. l got kicked out. l went up to Canada and tried to enlist, they wouldn´t have me.
-l can´t understand that.
-lt´s simple.
They don´t want men that have been kicked out of another army.
You´re frank, anyhow.
-l admire that quality.
-Why shouldn´t l be?
The so-called facts...
...are known in every army post in this hemisphere. l understand how you feel.
But you can´t afford to be bitter against your own countrymen.
-Particularly in these troubled times.
-Can´t l?
How do you know what l can afford? l´m sorry. l didn´t mean to intrude an unwanted opinion.
Okay, doc. l´ll hire out to whoever will pay for my services.
Chiang Kai-shek, Hirohito.
Anybody who will pay. l can´t tell you how l sympathize with you.
-Were you stationed long in the Canal Zone?
-Quite a while. l served at Fort Amador and Fort Sherman. l was attached to staff.
Amador guards the Pacific approach, doesn´t it?
Yeah.
-l think l´ve had too much to drink.
-You´re ill?
Can l help you, Mr. Leland?
Sick? Need help?
Go away.
Tea? Hold the head?
Beat it.
-Too much whiskey. Very sick. Should-a be.
-Beat it.
This is the happiest moment of my life.
My prayers have been answered.
Close the door when you leave.
They have a nice burial at sea.
Go away, will you? l wanna die alone without a friend.
You will. ls there anything l can do?
Something to make you sicker?
Just hang around.
Keep your shoes on. l hope you´ll need them.
-Rick, before l get off the gangplank--
-What?
Are there any stray hayseeds in my hair?
Now look, angel, l´ve gotta see a friend of mine. l think l can borrow some money.
You wait here for me.
-l´ll only be a few minutes.
-Okay.
Here you are, folks. Here you are.
The collected ingenuity of the four corners of the Earth for a quarter.
Twenty-five cents apiece.
Every article is unconditionally guaranteed. lf they don´t work, bring them back. l won´t be here.
Here´s something nice.
Scare your friends.
You won´t have many friends.
What´s the matter?
You taking root there?
Step right up, folks. Twenty-five cents.
One-quarter of a dollar. lt amuses the kiddies and amazes the old folks.
Send you to the madhouse.
Here you are, folks. Here you are.
The collected ingenuity of the four corners of the Earth for a quarter.
-Eighth floor.
-Eight.
-Eight, please.
-Eight.
Atlas Finance Company.
-One moment, please. Yes, sir?
-l´d like to see Mr. Hart.
-May l have your name, please?
-Leland.
He´s expecting you. Go right in.
Yes?
-Well, glad to see you, Captain Leland.
-Colonel Hart.
-Sit down.
-Thank you.
Say, l had to duck a fellow on the way up here.
White man.
Tall and thin.
Wore a long black overcoat and derby hat. l think l know the man.
We may soon pay him a visit.
-How did it go up north?
-Everything went about as expected.
But l must say that their rejection of my army application...
...was just a little bit on the insulting side.
By the way, how did you manage to get me on the boat?
Your story was told in the right quarters.
Dr. Lorenz was well informed about you before you even came aboard.
-Now, there´s a girl.
-l know. We´ve been checking on her.
But from what l hear, l don´t think she´s the type.
-Would she be there if she weren´t?
-Possibly, but l doubt it.
However, that´s up to you to find out.
What´s she like?
Well, remember the girl you used to dream about when you were 1 9?
Why, very well.
-This is her in the flesh.
-l see.
Well, how are you and the doctor getting along?
Famously, l´d say.
Well, don´t take too much for granted.
Lorenz is no chump, or he wouldn´t have lasted so long.
He may be just giving you enough rope.
Another thing, remember, on shipboard, anything can happen to a man.
A box drops on your skull, a wave washes you overboard. l´ll be careful.
You´re going to have a new shipmate.
Getting aboard is a young man by the name of Totsuiko, Joe Totsuiko.
A member of the Kokuryukai, and tough.
A Jap gunsel.
So watch out, if you bump into him.
-Yeah, l´ll do that.
-There´s one other item.
The details of your disgrace have been widely circulated...
...in Panama and the Pacific.
So you won´t be welcomed exactly with open arms. l´ll be on my own down there?
Smith is expecting you.
No one else knows.
Some big things are brewing.
We have reason to believe they´ll boil over.
We don´t know how soon or what side of the pot...
...but they´ll involve the canal, and that´s where you come in.
Because Lorenz may or may not be the key man. lt´s up to you to find out.
-Success.
-Thank you. l hope you and the girl l wanted to marry when l was 1 9...
...have a nice lunch together.
-Goodbye, sir.
-Goodbye.
-Who´s your friend?
-l don´t know. l hate to complain, but he´s been pretty nasty.
-Yeah? About what?
-The usual thing.
-Do you want to meet this lady?
-No.
She was under the impression you wanted to talk.
Not me. l guess l was just reciting something to myself.
Why don´t you recite something to me? l don´t know what you´re talking about. l gotta get going. lt´s not polite to walk out on a lady like that.
First, you say you´re sorry, then you say goodbye. l beg your pardon, lady. l mistook you for a girl who used to come in here and sit all the time. lt won´t happen again--
-Why didn´t you really hit him? Afraid?
-No, he had my number.
-Did you get your money?
-Yeah, more than l expected. Did l talk fast. ln that case, you´re going to get yourself a new suit.
This has been some day for a girl from Medicine Hat. ls that a gag, or do you really come from Medicine Hat?
What´s wrong with Medicine Hat?
Except it´s cold in winter and nothing happens there?
You happened there.
That´s enough for me.
By any chance, are you a woman of means, by any chance, l hope?
My father´s a farmer. l work in a 1 0-cent store. l sell peanut brittle. l see you whipped up the gaudy gown that you wear...
...on the family sewing machine.
-l´m on your blacklist?
-No, l´m used to bad luck. lt´ll probably end up with
Captain Higoto marrying us.
Oh, no. l want a church wedding and a groom who has more than two suits.
How long were you in Panama, Rick?
About four years.
You ever hear of a man by the name of Morton? Dan Morton?
Dan....
Yeah, he´s a planter, isn´t he?
A lot of dough. Why?
He´s related to some friends of mine.
Look him up. He might take a fancy to you and leave you all his money. l´m not so obsessed with money as you seem to be. l can do without it.
Well, you stick around with me and you´re going to get plenty of practice.
We can walk, Rick. Save your money.
This is no time to be a pinchpenny. l´m wooing a girl.
Pier 1 6.
Someone should tell our little friend that tight overcoats and guns don´t go together.
He´s liable to get picked up by a cop.
Pier 1 6.
Well, if we´d known he was coming here, we could have given him a lift.
What´s up, Rick?
-You stay here.
-You can´t dump me.
-Something´s gonna happen.
-Now, go back.
Don´t be an innocent bystander.
They always get hurt.
-You all right, doc?
-Yes.
Do you know him? l don´t think so. At any rate, he isn´t a close friend.
Okay, then we´d better send for the police. lf you don´t mind, l´d prefer that you didn´t.
Miyuma. lf the police were called there might be an investigation.
We might not be able to sail. lt´s none of my business what you do with him.
He wasn´t shooting at me. l can´t thank you enough, Mr. Leland.
Skip it, doctor. l was just coming onboard and practically stumbled over the guy.
How you doing, angel? l think l got pushed in the face by somebody.
-My-- My lipstick´s smeared.
-You look cute.
And now, if you´ll excuse me, l´ll go to my cabin...
...and faint. l hope no more of your homicidal friends are on the pier.
Standing so close to you might be bad luck.
First Officer Miyuma is taking care of that.
-You weren´t kidding.
-l suppose you´re wondering...
...about this little incident, Mr. Leland.
-No, not particularly.
-You know l´m a resident of the Philippines. ln fact, l consider myself a Philippine national.
And what do the Filipinos consider you? lt´s unfortunate that some of my fellow citizens...
...resent my realistic attitude toward Japan.
A few of them even go so far as to call me traitor.
That misguided little man in the long overcoat...
...undoubtedly believed he was acting on patriotic principles.
Whatever he believed, he believed pretty strongly. lf l were you, just from a health standpoint...
...l think l´d give up the Japs. l´m afraid my ties with the Japanese are rather too close for that.
Financially, spiritually, ideologically and otherwise. lf those ties involve some personal danger, l don´t mind...
...considering the ultimate reward. lf you don´t mind, l shouldn´t either. l´m being frank with you because you saved my life.
Naturally, anything l say is in confidence.
Naturally.
All that worries me is that l came on this trip for my health...
...but l seem to have come to the wrong place.
Never saw such a gunned-up boat in my life.
-Really?
-Yes.
Your little Filipino friend had a gun,
Sugi´s got a gun...
...and that wasn´t an apple the first officer was holding in his pocket.
You got a gun?
Even l, Mr. Leland.
Mine´s bigger than yours. l usually like to keep this locked up in my suitcase...
...but with all these guns around, what´s a fellow gonna do? l wouldn´t worry if l were you. l wouldn´t even think about it.
Thanks for the tip.
-Did you have a good time in New York?
-Wonderful.
Saw your man, got your money? l got it. Ms. Marlow made me spend it on a new suit.
-lt´s very handsome.
-Yes.
She seemed to think it made some improvement. l´ll be hitting the hay.
Anybody else starts throwing slugs at you, doc, don´t forget to duck. l believe l´ll be a little better prepared. Thank you.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Hey.
Am l nuts, or did l hear some shooting a few minutes ago?
-Did l miss anything?
-Firecrackers. Chinese New Year´s.
Maybe l am nuts, but it sounded like those firecrackers...
...were shot from a muzzle.
-My name´s Joe Totsuiko.
-Rick Leland. l´m sure glad there´s someone around that speaks my language. l´m rooming with a dope named T. Oki.
He´s got his lip buttoned up for good as far as l can figure out.
-Where you bound for?
-The Orient.
Me too. My old man´s sending me down there to work for one of my uncles.
Say, l wonder if those Panamanian mamas are all they´re cracked up to be.
Terrific, Joe. Simply terrific.
-Well, l´ll see you around, Ricky.
-Yeah, take it easy, Joe.
Without knocking, and where´s your modesty?
-What´s going on?
-Why, nothing´s going on.
Not so loud.
Well, that is, nothing except an attempted assassination.
Why get so excited about a little thing like that?
Who are you after?
Are you a G-man or something?
-What if l was?
-l just wondered.
Look, l´m just a private citizen, and l happened to be passing a room...
...where one guy was trying to bump off another guy...
...which, as you know, happens to be against the law.
´´Happened to be passing.´´
You followed our little friend...
...then lied to Lorenz about stumbling over him.
But you can´t do that to me. lf it´ll make you happy, l´m J. Edgar Hoover. This is my badge.
Some joke.
A man should tell the woman he´s going to marry everything.
Well, in that case, l´ll come clean.
What? l look old, but that´s because l´ve worried a lot. l haven´t yet reached the age of legal consent...
...and if you don´t get out, l´ll yell for help.
All right. You can get yourself another heiress.
Powder, angel. And when you go, stop thinking and keep your mouth shut.
Say, l never saw anybody like you.
You never have any clothes on. lf anybody heard you complaining about it, they´d put you in the psychopathic ward.
You birds of passage do not fight
But help each other in your flight
Japanese build their poetry like they do their houses.
Read some more, Joe.
Hey, you better turn over.
This side´s done.
Cherry blossoms at the well in danger are
See drunken man l think l´ll get drunk.
Your Occidental poet is wont to describe grand passions and heroic events.
Not so with the Japanese.
Their emotions are stirred by some tiny fragment of life...
...possessing the quality of beauty.
This he would extract, reduce, distill, as it were...
...down to its purest essence.
Then they do have emotions? l mean, like us. l mean, you´re always so calm.
You never show anything.
We are taught not to. lt is our way of life.
We must not show too much sadness or too much joy. lf you praise what we have, we say it is nothing. lf you admire our sons, we must say they are unworthy.
You´re most eloquent today,
Captain Higoto.
-Yes.
-The Nisei aren´t quite so calm.
Take me, for instance, kid. l´m a live wire.
-What are Nisei?
-Second-generation Japanese.
Those born in the good old U.S.A.
They represent a very small fraction, fortunately.
-Hope there´s nothing personal in that, doc?
-Oh, no.
Excuse, please.
Anybody wanna play shuffleboard?
Not me, Joe. l´m sleepy.
How about you, doc?
Shuffleboard? Hardly.
However, a game of gin rummy, perhaps?
Boy, let me at them pasteboards.
At last, we´re alone.
Now, listen, bright eyes--
No romance. There´s something very interesting over there, Ricky.
-Where? What do you mean?
-T. Oki. lt´s not the same Oki that came down from Halifax with us.
-That´s another man.
-The heat´s getting you.
-They all look alike.
-No, they don´t.
Not if you examine them closely.
Did you notice how the first Oki stood?
He stood with his head bowed and his shoulders bent.
This man stands up straight with his shoulders back.
The first Oki never put his hands in his pockets.
This man keeps his in his coat pockets all the time.
Take it easy, angel. Take it easy.
You´re on your way to being a detective...
...but l wouldn´t see too much, or it might be your last case.
-What do you mean?
-You´re getting a bad burn, you know it?
-l don´t feel like l am.
-l´d go inside and put stuff on.
Oh, it´s all right.
Remember the bread pudding.
Stick them up. l was only kidding, Oki.
Don´t get sore. Some joke, huh?
Mr. Leland.
-May l come in?
-Yeah. Come ahead.
Well, who won the gin rummy?
As Mr. Totsuiko put it, l was skunked four times.
-Sit down.
-Thanks.
-Have a drink, doc?
-Thank you.
Amusing fellow, Joe.
Quite.
A little of him goes a long way.
-To your health.
-No, to yours.
-Younger men have more to live for.
-Well, that is if they´re lucky. lt´s been my experience, one has to be smart to be lucky.
Then l hope l´ll be smart. l´m interested in you, Mr. Leland.
Especially since you saved my life.
You´re too modest.
Look, if you feel that calls for some dough--
That isn´t my idea, though it might be worth some help.
Such as?
One night, you told me about your troubles in the Army. l´d like to hear more about that. l got in a jam with a dame.
Yes? l needed some dough. l had access to the regimental funds...
...so l borrowed it, intending to put it back, of course.
-Of course.
-But they found out first.
The brass hats could´ve given me a chance if they´d wanted, but they didn´t.
They tied me up with pink ribbons and threw me to the wolves.
You can write your own finish.
Whatever that is to be, you´ll need some money.
You can have more when you want it, within reason, of course.
What´s my part of the deal? l never discuss being a traitor with a man.
You´ll find it easier if you don´t think about that part of it.
-Go ahead.
-Very well. ln a day or two, you´ll talk to me about certain installations...
...in the vicinity of both Balboa and Cristobal...
...with particular reference to antiaircraft emplacements...
...railway guns and ammunition dumps.
All you have to do is to remember accurately.
That ought to be worth quite a lot.
You´ll find me quite generous.
You´re not only interesting to me now, you´re also valuable.
But that shouldn´t cause you any anxiety.
Do you mind if it does? lf.... lf you were to apply for life insurance, stating all the facts...
...the company´s actuaries might decide...
...there were certain imponderables existent in your position.
For instance, having committed yourself...
...l wouldn´t want you to change your mind. lt might turn out to be most unfortunate.
All right.
Remember what l said, Mr. Leland.
About it being easier not to entertain certain thoughts.
Ms. Marlow burning up.
She say please come quick, put out fire.
Should-a Be.
Oh, boy, oh, boy. Well....
You certainly are a girl of many colors.
First your legs get blue, then your face turns green...
...now you´re red all over. l never knew what suffering was until l came on this pleasure trip.
Your trouble is, you know all the answers till the results are posted. l knew you couldn´t resist at least one ´´l told you so.´´ lt´s true. Seeing me in pain does give you pleasure.
-No, precious, it isn´t that.
-Then what are you so happy about?
Well, l just got some money from
Dr. Lorenz for saving his life.
Rick, you didn´t actually take money for saving a man´s life? ls there any other reason you know of why l should take money from Dr. Lorenz?
But Rick....
Oh, Rick, you´re not much account, are you? l think l´ll make a career out of saving lives.
Listen, precious, if that bothers you so much...
...you´re in for a real shock when we get to Panama.
How?
Well, you´re going to hear some things about me that aren´t very nice.
What kind of things? l believe l´ll leave that to the people who´ll get fun out of telling you.
Will what they tell me be true?
Yes.
Then l won´t listen.
Now l know you didn´t come from Medicine Hat.
-What´s all that about?
-Judo is more than a mere contest. lts devotees form a brotherhood.
Similar, in many respects, to our Western freemasonry. lt, too, has its degrees and its secrets...
...as well as its religious, or should l say, philosophical background.
Come again? lt´s an Oriental concept that destructive force acts upon itself.
And there you have the principle of jujitsu.
To turn the power of one´s antagonist upon himself...
...and by so doing, vanquish him.
That´s the art of the thing.
How would all that stack up against a right cross?
Throw one at me, Rick.
-What?
-Go ahead, throw one at me.
-You mean that, Joe?
-Sure l mean it. Sock me one.
All right, you asked for it.
Better get rid of those glasses.
Oh, Rick.
No hard feelings?
-Unfortunate. Most unfortunate.
-Something wrong, doctor?
The canal is being put into repair...
...so far as ships flying
Japanese colors are concerned.
-This ship can´t go through?
-Precisely. lt´ll have to sail around the Horn.
We shall be forced to get off at Cristobal and await another boat.
Unless we are prepared to add another
60 or 90 days to our voyage...
...which l most certainly am not.
So sorry to cause you this inconvenience.
Excuse, please.
Money will be refunded, of course.
Where will you stay, Mr. Leland?
The Pan-American.
Very quiet and respectable.
-That ain´t for me.
-Where you going? l´ll have to find someplace where they have a 40-cent lunch. l know the guy that owns the Pan-American. He´ll give you a rate.
-Perhaps l´ll try the Pan-American.
-l hate to recommend places. l´m sure our tastes will be similar. l see l ain´t got any folks to meet me.
-Can l give you some directions?
-No, thanks, Rick. l´ll find my way. lt´s been nice knowing you kids. l´ll be seeing you one of these days.
Keep your dukes up.
Sayonara, captain.
-Goodbye, captain. Thank you.
-Goodbye.
Here you are. Thank you.
You see a big wave coming, cap, don´t forget to duck.
-Five dollars?
-Forget it. l´m a rich man.
Goodbye, captain. l do not know, but l think l might have saved Dr. Lorenz some trouble on my boat. l think he will have very bad luck with you.
Skipper, everybody has bad luck with me.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
Hello, Leland.
What are you doing back here?
You ought to have more sense than to come back.
-lt´s a free country, isn´t it?
-lt sure is, for guys like you.
Sam, this is Ms. Marlow and Dr. Lorenz.
Very nice you come here.
Pan-American need beauty.
Sam, this lady is very poor--
-Don´t mind my parading your poverty?
-Not if it does the trick.
--and l told her that l had a pull with you.
-Can you take care of her cheap?
-Can do. l would like a room with northern exposure, if you please.
All same floor, all close together.
Your room not quite ready.
Maybe so have tea while wait.
Maybe so. l´ll be right along.
Office.
-What´s the matter you, Rick?
-What´s the matter me, Sam?
All the time people say you no good.
Big smell from up north.
What´s the matter you come back?
Too much Army here. Everyone know.
You through with Panama.
Panama through with you.
Well, Sam, maybe l won´t be here long.
Maybe so you need money go other place.
No, Sam, l don´t need money.
You no need money? Sam smell big fish.
Sam keep nose clean,
Sam no smell fish, no catchee trouble.
All the time you like trouble.
Maybe so Dr. Lorenz trouble?
-Maybe so.
-Girl too? l don´t know, Sam. l hope she´s all right.
She got you bad.
Much trouble.
All the time much trouble.
Sam...
...you can help me.
People tell you things.
People tell me because l don´t tell. l tell, they don´t tell me anymore.
Okay, Sam. lf you don´t wanna help me, you don´t have to.
-Can do.
-l knew you would, Sam. Thanks.
Be careful. lf l get any more careful, l won´t be any good.
Much trouble.
All the time much trouble.
Key, sir. Room 24.
Thanks. Hey.
Thanks, señor.
Mr. Leland.
-May l pay you a visit?
-Yeah, sure. Come on in.
-lt´s hot.
-Very. lce water, room 24, please.
Well, doc, what´s on your mind?
Now that we´re in Panama, l think it´s time you began to earn your money. lt´s hot.
Okay, doc. Where do we begin?
Pedro Miguel Locks will be a good place for a starter.
How many batteries are there?
What are their caliber?
Antiaircraft or heavy stuff?
Begin with the 1 6-inch guns.
Well, let´s see, the last time l was down here, two years ago...
...there were double railway guns east and west...
...two twin concrete embrasures half a mile to the north...
...one four-gun turret of shore-mounted Navy´s back of Hill 1 4.
But what´s the idea?
You know all that already.
-Testing me, eh?
-You examined the money l gave you?
That´s right. Do we go on?
We go on.
What specific knowledge have you...
...of the military plane patrol over the canal area?
Well, two years ago--
What happened two years ago doesn´t interest me. l want the current schedule of the patrol planes.
When the flights take off, exactly what areas they cover...
...what altitude they conduct their reconnaissance...
...and the precise time of their return. lce water, sir.
Now, that´s gonna take some getting.
-l´ll pay generously for it.
-How much?
-Shall we say $500?
-Shall we say $ 1 500? l said l´ll pay generously, not foolishly.
Now, just a minute.
Only place l can get that is Air Force headquarters. That won´t be easy.
May take almost a week of trying before things begin to break right. l´ll make you a deal.
Fifteen hundred if you get it by 5:00 today.
Five o´clock? Why all the rush?
-There´s no rush.
-Just $ 1 000 worth?
Remember, Mr. Leland, it´s your place to answer questions, not to ask them.
Sorry, l-- l´m a little new at this game.
Of course, of course.
Oh, and by the way, don´t get the ingenious idea...
...of selling me out to the American authorities. lt wouldn´t pay in the long run.
Wait a minute.
-Who is it?
-lt´s me.
-How you doing?
-All right.
-You happy?
-Very.
-What´s the program?
-l´m free as a bird. l got a couple of things to do.
Meet you at the lnternational Bar at 1 :00.
-How do l get there?
-Tell any cab driver. Come as you are.
-What can l do for you, sir?
-l want to open an account.
-Sit down, please.
-Thank you.
-Savings or checking?
-Savings.
And what is the name?
Leland. Richard Leland.
Will you sign there, please?
There you are.
How much did you wish to deposit?
One thousand two hundred and forty-one dollars.
No one can get close enough to hear us without our seeing them.
Go ahead with your report,
Captain Leland.
Lorenz is hooked. l´m on his payroll, $350 worth.
He must think you´re very valuable.
What have you got?
Not much. Lorenz seems to be head man.
They switched his valet in New York.
The new T. Oki could be a Naval Officer.
He is. Have you any idea what Lorenz is up to?
No, but l´ve got a hunch that whatever´s going to happen will happen soon.
He offered me the family jewels for the canal-patrol flight schedule...
...and he wants it quick.
-We could hardly afford--
-Worth the gamble to keep his confidence.
-We could make up a fake schedule.
-Yes, we could.
All he´d have to do is get a pair of binoculars and a watch...
...to find out he´d been tricked.
We better give him the real dope. l´ll phone you if things get to looking dirty, and you can always change the schedule.
Very well.
Under the circumstances, l suppose it wouldn´t be too dangerous.
They´d hardly keep those men in Washington if they intended to pull a fast one.
Should-a Be.
Now, about the schedule.
Oh, yes. l´ll have a copy of the schedule at your hotel this afternoon.
Any more dope about the girl from Medicine Hat?
She never lived there. She´s a New Yorker.
A buyer for Rogers Fifth Avenue.
She´s made eight trips abroad in the last two years.
Of course, that could be part of her work.
Well...
...l guess that slams the door on Ms. Marlow. lt´s a funny thing, though.
She pointed out the Oki switch to me.
Sometimes the best way to gain a confidence is to give one.
What have you got on a Dan Morton?
Owns a plantation here called Bountiful.
Pardon me.
Age, 55 to 60. Came here in ´31 .
Heavy drinker. Bit of a dipsomaniac.
Maybe a little cracked.
His plantation has been profitable.
Has substantial accounts in three banks.
Apparently, no entanglements, either political or feminine.
-Why do you ask?
-She asked me about him.
Said people in Halifax told her to look him up. l don´t believe anyone with as much money as Dan Morton...
...would bother with the small profit that treason pays.
And he´s hardly the type to go in for the excitement. However, you never can tell.
And now, l think you´ve been here long enough, captain. l´ll check with you later.
You send the schedule over to my hotel at 5:00.
Of course you´ll phone me at the first suspicion they´re making use of it.
-And your book, captain.
-Of course.
-Thank you very much, Mr. Smith.
-Good day, sir. l´m sorry to be late, angel. l was held up.
Oh, l like waiting for you, Ricky.
Wouldn´t l make a splendid wife?
-What´ll it be?
-Something cool and long.
Something cool and long.
How about a couple of planter´s punches?
Fine.
Rick, l had the funniest feeling coming over here. l felt as though l were being followed.
A cab stayed right behind mine all the way over from the hotel. l may be imagining things, but l don´t think so.
Who do you think would follow you? l wouldn´t know. Would you?
All that funny business on the boat, what did it mean, Rick?
Who is Dr. Lorenz and what is he up to?
You´re good, angel.
You´re very, very good.
Don´t you think it´s time we got together on a few things?
-Such as?
-Who we are and what we are. l´ve told you everything about me.
Now, look, angel, we can play this dumb or play it smart. l´m in this for what l can get, and l don´t think l´m getting enough.
Now, we can make Lorenz pay off plenty if we throw in together.
-l don´t know what you´re talking about.
-Come off it. l don´t know how you got in with Lorenz´ crowd, but you´re in it. l didn´t know Lorenz had a crowd.
Oh, yes, l forgot.
You´re the little lady from Medicine Hat. lt was your twin sister who was the buyer for Rogers Fifth Avenue.
Couldn´t be she held that job so she could conveniently take trips abroad, could it?
Let´s see, how many did she make two years ago? Three, wasn´t it?
You must´ve gone to a lot of trouble to find all this.
Sometimes it pays to go to a lot of trouble. l don´t know what you´re thinking, but whatever it is, you´re mistaken.
Yes? ln what way am l mistaken?
-All right, Rick, l´ll tell you.
-Well, well, well. The happiness kids.
-Hello, Joe.
-Hello, Joe.
´´Pull up a chair, Joe.´´
Thanks, l will.
What´s that you´re knocking yourselves out with?
Hey, waiter, l´ll have one of those.
Well, how are we doing?
-All right until this moment.
-l´m cramping your style?
-Ms. Marlow?
-Oh, l´m Ms. Marlow.
-A telephone call.
-That´s funny. Who could it be?
Well, it´s easy enough to find out.
This way, please.
You know what l think l´ll do?
Take the train into Panama City and catch a coastline freighter.
Next boat is three or four days from now. lt´s a Chinese boat, and l´m not so keen on taking a Chinese boat...
...so l figure l´ll be saving time if l catch a coastline freighter to San Francisco...
...and make new connections there.
-What do you figure on doing?
-Me? l-- l don´t know yet.
Why don´t you string along with me?
We could share a cabin.
-That´s not a bad idea, except--
-Oh, l get it. The little lady.
Can´t say l blame you.
She sure is a swell dish.
Too bad about the Genoa Maru not being let through.
She wasn´t a bad ship...
...even though you did grab the only dame onboard. l gotta hand it to you, Rick...
...you sure are a fast worker if there ever was one.
-Ms. Marlow, did she go?
-Sí, señor, just now.
-The party that called, any name?
-No, señor.
-Anything the matter, Rick?
-No, no, not a thing.
Where´d she go? Oh, l get it.
Joe, do me a favor, will you? lf she comes back within 1 0 minutes...
...ask her to phone the hotel, let me know where she´ll be.
-You take care of the check.
-Sure thing, Rick.
Mr. Leland?
-Has Ms. Marlow come back?
-No. There´s something for you.
-Dr. Lorenz?
-Upstair.
-Any calls for him?
-No call.
Hey, Sam, give me a passkey, will you?
Can do. lf she gets back, ring twice, her room.
Will do.
-Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Leland.
-Oh, that´s all right.
Has your search revealed anything?
Yes.
You´d be surprised how little girls wear these days. l was shocked. lt´s 5:05, Mr. Leland. l believe you said 5:00.
You´re a little fast, but anyway.... l would consider it prudent if you would cease your attentions to Ms. Marlow.
-Why so, doc?
-Your interest in her...
...is unqualifiedly romantic, is it not, Mr. Leland?
Between the two of us, doctor, l´m nuts about the lady. l suggest that you find a safer romance.
Something more permanent.
And now, Mr. Leland, the schedule.
-Look, doc--
-That is it in the envelope, Mr. Leland?
Oh, yes. That´s it, all right.
-Fifteen hundred.
-Now, hold on. l know l said 1 500, but it cost me that much. Almost, anyway.
-l´ll only get a few bucks out of it.
-That´s your business.
-My business is to take care of myself.
-How much more?
-Let´s say 500.
-Very well.
Bear in mind, Mr. Leland, that such extraordinary procedure...
...doesn´t dispose me towards further dealings with you.
You´ve got me all wrong. lt isn´t that l don´t wanna play ball.
For all l know, you´ll hand me the 1 500 and wave goodbye. l´ll be left out in the cold with nothing to show for it. lf l were on the inside of things-- l shall have to make out a check for the 500, Mr. Leland.
-Then it is a kiss off?
-For the moment, yes.
-Perhaps in time to come--
-l´ve got another proposition.
Sorry, not interested.
No checks, doc. l´m a cash-and-carry man.
But, Mr. Leland, it´s after 5:00.
The banks are closed.
-l´ll never be able to get any such sum.
-Well, then it´s no dice.
As you say, sir.
Remember, mine´s bigger than yours.
You overestimate your value to us,
Mr. Leland.
Actually, we have on file any information you can give us. lt´s merely that we like to check and recheck such data. ln other words, your services were never at any time indispensable.
Come off it, doc.
-Oh, you doubt me, Mr. Leland?
-No offense. l´m checking out.
Have my bill ready.
Send up a boy for the bags.
You´re leaving, doc? l must continue my journey.
Goodbye and good luck, in spite of our little difference.
By Jove, l think you mean it.
Mean what, sir?
What you said about not needing this.
Dispose of it as you will, Mr. Leland.
Okay, doc, you win. l was only bluffing.
-Let´s see the color of your money.
-But l was not bluffing.
The deal is off.
Oh, don´t be that way, doc.
After all, l did save your life once.
You´ll never know how fortunately that circumstance has operated for you.
Give me a break, doc.
-How much?
-Fifteen hundred.
A thousand it is. l guess l deserve it.
-Who is it?
-Bellboy, señor.
Come in.
Give me Colon 893.
Hello.
Can l talk to Mr. Smith?
Smith?
-This is Leland.
-Yes, Mr. Leland, what is it? l was unable to contact you. l´ve been out all evening.
Now, listen...
...our plans must be changed.
You understand?
Our plans must be changed.
Can you take care of that? l shall take care of it immediately.
Thank you very much.
Number, please?
Number, please?
What´s the matter you, Rick?
Where you been?
How you get your head-bump trouble?
My pal Dr. Lorenz.
Pretty, eh, Sam?
Dr. Lorenz go 5:1 5 in private car.
That license number, no good.
Stolen plate.
-What about Ms. Marlow?
-She no come back.
-Much trouble.
-You said it, Sam.
You like movie show, maybe?
Go Ewa Theatre. Buy ticket, 1 0:00.
-What´s up, Sam?
-Much trouble.
-You got a gun?
-Can do.
Order automobile for front.
Much trouble.
-Thanks, Sam.
-Much trouble all the time.
-Stick around.
-Yeah.
Bountiful Plantation.
Go Bountiful Plantation, fat man there.
Go quick. Bountiful Plantation.
Let´s get away from here fast.
How much further is the house?
Two, three miles.
You better turn your lights off.
Keep your lights off until you get a mile or two back down the road.
No move.
Up hands.
Rick.
Mr. Leland, l am surprised. lndeed, l am.
But that´s the way with you.
You´re always furnishing surprises.
Come in, sir.
Join our little family.
-Hello, Rick.
-Hi, Joe.
Some joke, eh?
Have a seat.
Astounding recuperative powers you possess, Mr. Leland.
Or should l say, Captain Leland?
Amazing animal energy.
The average man, given the punishment you received...
...would be flat on his back for at least a week. lt comes from living a clean life, doc. l hope you saw what you came to see, sir.
Yeah. Looks like you boys are planning to knock over the canal.
You said it. When those
8-foot torpedoes hit the Gatún Locks...
...it´ll make the Johnstown flood look like something that happened in a bathroom.
Don´t be too sure. Maybe your plane will never reach the Locks.
Maybe you overlooked something.
Could you suggest anything, sir, that we might have overlooked?
What about your getaway?
We have a rendezvous with an undersea boat. l think you´ll discover, captain, that nothing...
...absolutely nothing, has been left to chance.
Maybe you´re right, doc. lt seems you are.
You mind telling me how you got the plane and torpedo parts into the Canal Zone area?
Not at all.
Piece by piece and bit by bit.
We brought them in cases of otherwise innocent farm equipment...
...addressed to D. Morton,
Bountiful Plantation.
-D. Morton?
-Mr. Marlow, alias D. Morton.
Her father.
Where do you figure in all this? l don´t, Rick. l never did. l told you that, remember? l didn´t know what was going on here. l felt something was wrong.
His letters were so strange. l wrote him that l would come down.
He said l shouldn´t, l might be followed.
Then l got a telegram to go to Halifax and take the Genoa Maru. l was going to tell you when l got the telephone call. lt was Father. He said to come quickly and to make sure that l wasn´t followed.
That´s why l left the way l did.
Nice timing, doc. l take my hat off to you.
Thank you, sir. Americans are famous for good sportsmanship.
Tell me, captain, would your attitude remain the same-- lmpersonal, objective.
--were you to know that Smith,
Mr. A.V. Smith...
...was unable to act on your last words?
-Stay put, Rick.
-l see the knowledge does affect you. lt´s nothing, captain, nothing at all.
They´re only tuning up the motors.
We have a few minutes yet.
You´d better sit down, Rick.
What do you want? l will....
Pathetic, is he not, sir?
This rugged individual. Look at him.
Eyes without focus, flesh without feeling...
...lips with no tongue, utter decay.
He stinks.
Mr. Marlow is a thief.
A lazy, comfortable, drunken thief.
He absconded with his company´s funds.
Escaped to Panama with his loot, assumed another identity.
Felt conscience-stricken.
Mr. Marlow´s dipsomania enabled us to introduce our nationals into his employ...
...under the guise of workers and servants. ln due time, he became a prisoner on, rather than the master of, this plantation.
Get up. Get up.
His lmperial Highness, the Prince Kazuo Takamitsu lnoue.
Yeah, we´ve met before.
You the pilot, Oki?
His Highness asked permission from the emperor to perform this mission.
As you see, Captain Leland, l, too, was only kidding.
We have no wish to kill you,
Captain Leland, unless....
Okay, doc, l´ll be good.
Joe.
You can sit down now, folks.
Nobody´s going anywhere.
You guys been looking for a war, haven´t you?
That´s right, Rick.
That´s why we´re starting it.
You may start it, Joe, but we´ll finish it.
We´ll see, Rick.
Don´t get nervous, Rick. l might lose control of this.
You know something, angel?
-What?
-l wish you´d stayed in Medicine Hat.
Rick!
Rick.
Rick.
Well, now, take it easy, angel.
-Have you seen Lorenz?
-Yes, he was running towards the house.
Go ahead.
What´s the matter, doc, haven´t you got the nerve?
You´re a soldier, sir. l appeal to you.
Bullet, here.
Some other time. l ask you again.
-Do me the honor.
-No, l can´t do it.
You´ve got a date with Army lntelligence.
Come on, doc.
You know, you´re a great disappointment to me...
...after that big speech you made about weakness and decay.
Right on time, eh, doc?
Any of your friends in Tokyo have trouble committing hara-kiri...
...those boys will be glad to help them out.
Right down there.
Well, angel?
[ENGLlSH]
What was that?
It was yourself,
O Guardian of the Harem.
You... burped.
Silence... daughters of foolishness.
I was but paying tribute to the generosity of our lord and master.
Let us to the improvement of your minds, what there is of them.
For today's reading, we will take the story of the dancing girl and the two brothers.
Now, all together. When the noble and beloved Haroun-Al-Raschid...
"When the noble and beloved
Haroun-Al-Raschid... ascended to the throne of the Caliphs, he had many secret enemies, not least among them, being his elder brother, the passionate and cruel
Kamar-Al-Zaman, born of a slave of the harem... and barred, therefore, from the succession to the throne."
Very good, very good.
Continue alone, O my little Dunya.
"Now, it happened that in Bagdad at this time, there was a dancing girl named Sherazade... whose skill and beauty... had made her the idol of the people."
The story, the story!
Now you, Ayesha.
"Yet Sherazade, because of the poverty of her childhood, was as avid of power and riches as a shipwrecked mariner of water.
Kamar had seen the beauteous maid... and like many others, had fallen madly in love with her."
Enough, enough.
Be silent and listen.
But Sherazade had spurned his love, saying half in jest and half in earnest,
"Return to me, O Kamar, when you are
Caliph of Bagdad and I will listen to you."
But Kamar, besotted by love, had taken the jest in earnest.
And rebelling against his brother, had been defeated and captured, thereafter being condemned to suffer the punishment of the slow death... even as the law provides.
Haroun-Al-Raschid!
Salaam, O Mighty Caliph.
- Is he dead?
- Not yet.
They will tell us when.
Seven days and seven nights and still he lives.
Nadan, this is no end for one of Allah's creatures.
You must not relent, my lord.
- It is the law.
- It is man's law, not Allah's.
- He was a great warrior, Nadan.
- And a great rebel, my lord.
Were he in your place and you in his, he would be merciless.
He always hated me, even when we were children.
- Yet, now you pity him.
- Why not?
He's cursed with an ambition he could never fulfill.
Is that not to be pitied?
You mistake, my lord.
It was not ambition alone that prompted your brother to rebel.
There is a dancing girl,
Sherazade.
Sherazade?
It was to win her love that he dared to seek your throne.
A slow death for love of a woman.
Sherazade! Let us see Sherazade!
We want Sherazade!
Let us see Sherazade, the dancing girl.
All right, hurry!
Change into your acrobat costumes.
Ali? Where is Ali?
That boy is always late.
He will be the death of me. Hurry!
- Love of Allah, Sinbad!
- You're in a hurry, are you?
Yes, I...
- A great hurry.
- A terrible hurry.
The day of reckoning will come!
- We want Sherazade.
- We want Sherazade!
Listen to them.
The crowd is hungry for you tonight, mistress. You'd better hurry.
Let them wait, the fools.
I detest them!
I'm their servant, their slave.
But one day, one day when I'm above them all...
But the day never seems to come.
And there may never be another Kamar to risk his life to make you a queen.
Silence! How dare you, you...
Sherazade, my sweet!
What is this?
They are calling for you.
Let them call.
I'll come when I'm ready!
- Get out! Get out! Do you hear?
- Allah, defend me.
First it is that son of Satan, Ali, and now...
I'm going. Look, I'm going.
Good-bye. I'm going.
The madness of his desire for Sherazade has brought him to this torture.
It is the law.
Law or no law.
He's suffered enough.
Wait!
Kamar's men!
Stop him! Stop Haroun.
Free him.
By the mighty Valda, who will perform an unheard of feat... of supporting six men at the same time, unaided.
You are about to witness a most phenomenal performance of all times, including that world-famous Ali Ben Ali.
Pull in your neck, O brother, to the wine barrel.
O you grateful son of infamy!
And this is Ali, Ali the wonderful,
Ali the magnificent,
Ali, the world's greatest acrobat... who is the son of an acrobat, who himself was the son of a son of a son of a son of an acrobat.
Go!
Watch him as he climbs high above the blessed earth.
Watch Ali defying death in that death-defying feat... of standing his head upon the head of Sinbad.
Now, my noble friends, watch closely... and see how this miracle of miracles is performed.
Watch each man flex his powerful muscles... as the seventh wonder of the world...
Watch how steady this tower of men rises to the heavens!
Note how steady and straight they stand, never swaying, like the giant pine tree of the forest.
Now, watch Ali very closely as he places his head...
Pick it up a little.
Get up a little higher!
Watch Ali very closely as he places his head... upon the head of Sinbad and points his toes to the sky.
Watch them regain their balance.
Watch them sway as they bend and... bend!
Isn't it wonderful?
Watch!
The ring of the Caliph.
Haroun-Al-Raschid.
Sherazade! Give us Sherazade.
Sherazade. Give us Sherazade.
Mistress, you cannot, you must not.
You have to...
Let go of me.
- What happened?
- This stranger, he is hurt, his shoulder.
I saw it all upside down.
I would swear I have seen this man before, but where?
Maybe in your dreams.
It is written that dreams of a woman are engraved upon her heart.
I dream of no man.
Look, his eyes are opening.
Who... who are you?
I am Sherazade.
Sherazade.
I know now why... why he risked so much.
What does he mean?
Who is he?
Who were those who tried to kill him?
- The followers of Kamar.
- Of Kamar?
- How do you know?
- Look. He is dead.
That one's own mother would never recognize his face.
Now, you fortunate holders of ducats, you are about to witness the most phenomenal...
Kamar is free.
Kamar has escaped!
Kamar is free.
Kamar has escaped.
Aladdin, can't you look where you're going?
I'm looking for Sherazade.
If I don't find her, I'm lost.
You wouldn't be lost if I hadn't lost my magic lamp.
You lost that when you were a little boy.
You've lost all sense of time.
And I've lost my... I've lost...
I'm losing my mind.
Sherazade? Sherazade?
Oh, where is she?
Where is she?
I die, I expire.
Sherazade, where is she?
Oh, praise be Allah, there you are.
- Kamar, he's escaped!
- I know that.
And suppose he has?
You must hide until they've recaptured him.
Valda, quickly, prepare the litter.
Sherazade runs in fear of no man.
He will be here seeking you.
He might carry you off with him out of the country.
Against my will?
Let him dare to lay a hand on me.
Let him dare!
Sherazade, be reasonable.
Without you, I have no show.
Lovely Sherazade, maiden sweeter than honey.
I tell you, I will stay.
I am neither afraid of Kamar nor any man that lives.
But there is one thing you forget.
If you remain here, Kamar is sure to come seeking you.
It is the one place the soldiers will be looking for him.
- He is sure to be taken again.
- What is that to me?
You have said it is written in your stars that you will be a queen.
If Kamar leaves Bagdad now alone, he will have a chance outside the city to organize his followers, to try again to seize his brother's throne.
- Then you could be a queen indeed.
- I wonder.
It is the way, Sherazade, the way of destiny.
Believe me.
You are right, Ali.
Well, what are you waiting for, you fool?
Hurry, you fools! Come a running!
Sinbad, come! Hurry! Run!
Do something! Get the baskets!
What about the wounded one?
- He has nothing to do with us.
- Kamar's men tried to kill him.
If they return seeking you and find him...
Very well.
He shall come with us.
Come! Move! Go!
- Here.
- If I only had my magic lamp.
One rub and out popped a genie ten leagues high, my slave.
You've told that lamp story so often, you believe it yourself!
Look, look. My lamp!
Oh, the genie at last!
This is no time for sleeping.
I told you to get the litter.
Come! Move!
Aladdin. Sinbad.
Forward, all of you. Bear that litter. Move, you fools!
You, with the cart, forward!
Name of Allah, hurry!
Don't tire yourself working so hard, Sinbad.
This calls to mind an experience
I had when I was a sailor.
We don't want to hear it.
I'd like less Sinbad the sailor, more Sinbad the worker.
Stop your lies and lend a hand.
This particular voyage had lasted for six long years.
Here's the body.
How do you know it's Haroun?
He wears a robe and a ring of the Caliph.
Hail, O Kamar-Al-Zaman.
This day you shall mount the throne of the Caliphs in your brother's stead.
My throne... and Sherazade's.
I have already sent the captain of the guard to escort her here, my lord.
Nadan, you've helped me to achieve my greatest happiness.
You'll not find me ungrateful.
To serve you loyally is reward enough, my lord.
The captain has returned, my lord.
Let him enter.
Where's Sherazade?
I... I do not know, my lord.
- She has disappeared.
- You lie.
It is the truth, O mighty one.
The circus has gone and all the players with it.
I can find no trace of them.
I tried, but...
Stop babbling like a fool.
The girl must be found. Take your men and search every house in the city.
Find Sherazade and bring her here!
Captain, a word, a word of interest to you.
I have great influence with the Caliph.
I do not wish it to be destroyed by a dancing girl.
Such a beautiful beard.
- He'll probably want to kill you!
- He'll thank me.
Oh, I still say we should have found a doctor for that wound of his.
No, Aladdin, that's not it either.
Well? What are you doing?
Just what you told us, keeping quiet and hiding.
Do you have to keep quiet so quietly?
There's work to be done.
Did you find out?
What of Kamar?
Allah protect us.
No one knows.
Bagdad is in such a turmoil and just when we're doing so much business!
Is he still here?
Name of the prophet, what have you done to him?
Anyway, who asked you to pick up dying strangers in the street
- to share my quarters and eat my food?
- He's eaten none of your food.
Hear that? He's awakening.
Hungry, I'll wager my life.
Quiet, fat one.
Kamar.
- Kamar.
- Kamar is not here.
Who are you?
Who...
We are your friends.
But this place, how have I come here?
I...
- Who dared?
- I was your barber, good sir.
It was necessary.
The followers of Kamar are everywhere.
Everywhere, are they?
Well, I'll...
You're weak from loss of blood.
I'm afraid I need food and something to drink.
I knew it!
See? I told you. He's a beggar.
Now see here, you. If you would share in our food, you must work.
What can you do?
Can you juggle, stand on your head?
That's it!
You... standing on your head.
- It wasn't a dream.
- No, it certainly was not.
- And afterwards, a girl.
- There was a girl?
Yes. Sherazade.
Sherazade.
Of course.
But where is she?
- In there, asleep.
- She nursed you most of the night.
Your shoulder.
All this is very nice, but my question is still unanswered.
You, sir, are you in a position to pay for all these ministrations?
Ahmad, be silent.
You shall be repaid, all of you, many fold.
- But how soon?
- At once, today.
As soon as I return to my... to my home.
- But what guarantee have I of all this?
- Please, Ahmad!
This man to me is but an unsampled well on a strange oasis.
Why should I trust him?
My face is not enough?
A face is but a face.
Skin and bones with eyes.
Yours could be the face of a rogue, a robber, a cutthroat!
How should I know?
Then suppose I swear to repay you?
Swear by the beard of the Caliph?
Would that suffice?
Of course it would!
I know I shall regret this.
But you...
Here.
Valda, bring him food and wine, the new wine.
And the rest of you, because we all must be idle, must you all be idle?
There's work to be done.
Go, go!
This calls to mind an experience
I had when I was a sailor.
- In farthermost...
- No tales, Sinbad.
Work, work. Here, take this.
Ingrate! Brother to the only brother of an only brother of an idiot!
You must forgive Ahmad.
He is really kindhearted.
I know. And I'm grateful to him and all of you.
- Hail, O Mighty Caliph.
- You know?
- Yes.
- But the others?
I was afraid to tell them.
They might have made too much fuss.
And I had problems enough.
You're a very old one for one so young.
What is your name?
Ali Ben Ali.
Your slave 'til death,
O Mighty Caliph.
Not my slave, Ali, my friend.
Who, from this hour forth, can ask anything in my power to grant.
It is his.
Thank you, noble one.
It was Sherazade who really saved you.
It was she who got Ahmad to let us bring you here.
- The girl does not know?
- No.
Yet she... she cared for me through half the night.
- Why?
- She is a woman.
And all women, like all mules, are unpredictable.
Only Sherazade is worse than any mule!
Sherazade!
We were just speaking about you.
Ahmad will be looking for me.
I better go help the others.
The tongue of Ali is swift, too swift for his own good.
Will you sit with me while I eat?
I understand I have much to thank you for.
It was the whim of Ali that you should come with us.
I did not mind.
And last night... nursing me?
I could not sleep anyway.
You would really trouble yourself for no man, except perhaps Kamar.
Everyone knows you promised to marry him if he became Caliph.
And why not?
It is my destiny to marry a king and rule a kingdom.
- Written in your stars.
- You don't believe it?
You think I am not worthy to be a queen?
I think you're sublimely worthy.
There's one trouble.
What if your friend Kamar never gains the throne?
Then he will do without me.
And if he loves you?
I do not desire love.
I desire power.
- You are sure of that, Sherazade?
- I am sure.
You say that with your lips.
There's a different answer in your eyes.
You are dreaming.
You are a woman to make men dream.
You could love a man for himself alone, regardless of power, of everything.
No, it is not true.
I will not let it be true!
Sherazade! Sherazade!
Word has just come.
Kamar, they've made him Caliph.
Haroun is dead.
They found his body last night.
And Kamar has been proclaimed
Caliph by the Great Council.
- His soldiers control the city!
- So the Caliph Haroun is dead!
- Believe me, I did not know...
- Never mind, Ali.
In fact there are times when it is most desirable to be dead.
Kamar, Caliph of Bagdad.
Kamar upon the throne!
Did I not tell you?
You are not yet on the throne beside him.
Of course she is.
Already she is as good as queen.
Sherazade, whom I have loved as my own daughter, for whom I have done countless favors.
The good, the sweet, the grateful Sherazade.
Listen.
- Are you the dancing girl, Sherazade?
- I am.
You are to come with me and your friends with you.
You hear? All of us!
- By whose command?
- The new Caliph, Kamar-Al-Zaman.
But a moment to prepare and I am ready.
Did you hear? His first act as
Caliph was to send for Sherazade.
I shall be practicing how to salaam when you pass by.
- You must not go. Stay here.
- I will go.
But remember from now forward my name is Ahmeen.
I better find you some other clothes!
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Praise Allah.
What is this?
Why have you brought us here?
This does not look to me like the way to the palace.
- I do not like it.
- Be silent.
No one has asked for your opinion.
You must get away.
This may be your last chance.
Look!
Slave traders!
Be ready.
- Now what?
- Slave traders.
So this is the girl.
Good.
In fact, excellent, excellent!
Is this man mad?
When the new Caliph hears of this...
The new Caliph Kamar will never hear.
Where we are sending you, not even Allah himself could find you.
Chain them, quickly!
Hurry, go! Hurry, hurry!
Pick him up.
Hold him fast!
Put the chains on him.
Inside.
No! You, back there.
The amount agreed upon.
You, you, bear the litter.
Follow me.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Allah, Allah!
Allah. Praise Allah.
Praise be to the prophet.
"Be it known to all loyal subjects... that any person bringing news of the whereabouts... of the dancing girl Sherazade and her companions... to the summer palace of the Caliph will be richly rewarded."
Tighter!
Tighter!
No!
Son of infamy, every bone in your body shall be broken if you continue to defy me.
The blind beggar said you sold Sherazade into slavery.
Is that true?
Tighter!
Tighter.
More!
Enough!
- I know nothing, my lord.
- You lie.
There must've been others with you in this plot. Who were they?
Tell me their names and I promise you a quick death.
- See that he lives 'til he speaks.
- Yes, my lord.
I am going now to find her.
No power on earth can keep me from that.
If when I return you're still alive,
I promise you an eternity of suffering.
Slacken the rope.
I can release you from this torture if you will be honest with me.
The blind one spoke the truth, did he not?
Yes, my lord.
You told me to make certain that the girl would never return so I thought...
You could obey my commands and fill your purse at the same time.
I meant no harm, my lord.
What is the slave trader's name?
Hakim.
Where can I find him?
At the marketplace of El Bessera.
It is the truth, my lord.
You have served me well... and I shall release you.
Now, my noble sirs,
I have 90 dinars bid.
Surely a trifling figure for so sublime a slave.
Do I hear 100?
Oh, come now, noble sirs.
Behold this young, beauteous damsel.
See, my noble gentlemen.
I remove her veil.
And now, my noble sirs, do I have your final bid... for this ravishing vision of loveliness?
I have 90 dinars.
Who'll say 100?
- One hundred dinars!
- She is sold.
Sold to the merchant Abdullah.
Quickly. Fetch another.
Next one.
You!
Hurry.
- Come on. Hurry.
- I am ready!
Come on!
- Does it move?
- Not yet.
Sherazade, there's still a chance.
You must not give up hope.
What have I to hope for?
That out there?
And now, my noble sirs, we have another tempting and tantalizing morsel,
Marzena, the exquisite flower of the Nile.
What am I bid?
150 dinars!
I have 150 dinars.
Will someone say 200?
Oh, come, noble sirs!
200 dinars!
Stand back.
Let me.
Come along, my masters, bid.
- Have you no eyes for beauty?
- 200 dinars!
That is a man who speaks.
Who'll make it 250?
250 dinars.
They are in a good mood.
It's time to offer them the dancing girl. Bring her.
Who says 300?
Come, my good sirs, who'll say 300? 300!
Speak one of you. Are you all women?
Or will one of you say 300?
- 300 dinars.
- She is sold!
Sold to the noble and most venerable Kassim Baba.
May Allah strengthen him.
They are coming for Sherazade.
- So this is the end.
- No, Sherazade, listen to me.
- You, on the top tier, forward.
- There are things I cannot explain, but in my rightful place
I have power, great power.
Somehow I will regain that power.
Then I swear to you, I'll seek you out and set you free, free to fulfill your destiny.
And if I am dead when that day comes?
No, Sherazade.
All right, you, outside.
- Not you, step back.
- Where I go, she goes.
Sherazade, you must believe me.
Here, I'll help.
Pull!
Wait! Wait! And now, noble sirs, prepare yourselves... for a sight such as is seldom seen by mortal eyes.
A vision of beauty beyond your dreams.
A foretaste of paradise itself.
She is as a young moon, mounting the stairway of the stars.
See how she approaches.
What poise, what grace.
See, my noble lords, what an exquisite creature.
Think that she can be yours or yours or yours to possess for all time.
Do not dare. I warn you, if you show me to those men, this will be yours.
I swear it.
Do you hear that, you old men?
If this man as much as touches me,
I swear I will kill him.
What am I to do?
You she-cat!
Noble sirs, you see my plight.
This impossible creature...
No, no, no, I mean, this superb woman of character... cannot bear to deprive one of you of the privilege... of being alone in his joy.
Which one of you is to be that lucky man?
Oh, come, sirs, what am I bid?
Unveil her. Come, come, unveil her.
Unveil her.
We want to see her first!
Does it mean nothing to you to have the sole, the exclusive, the breathtaking privilege of seeing the beauteous damsel alone?
1,000 dinars.
Ah, that's better, noble sir.
I am bid...
What was that you said, noble sir?
1,000 dinars.
A thou...
Come this way, noble sir.
Come this way.
Sherazade has been sold.
- May we know the name of the noble lord?
- Do you wish names or gold?
Together now! Together!
Let me go too, master.
This must not fail.
The rest of you, be ready.
Help! Help!
Help! Let us out!
- Hey, let us out!
- What is this?
The plague!
- We shall all die.
- And you'll lose your money!
Let them out.
Hurry up, you fool, let them out.
The rope!
I'll wait for you at the dunes of El Sohmra.
- Shall I help you hold him?
- No, help me let go of him.
- But if the slavers should follow.
- They will not.
- You are safe, Sherazade.
- Ali, Ahmad and the others?
They, too, will have escaped.
I told Ali we would meet here.
Then we will return to Bagdad, to the palace of Kamar.
No, not to Kamar.
Sherazade, you shall not return to Bagdad now.
You will ride with me beyond the river.
You speak as though
I were your slave.
There are different kinds of slavery... a woman taught me.
A woman?
A woman whose beauty shames the glory of the desert sunset.
Hello?
Hello!
Ahmeen! Sherazade!
You see?
As I told you, they are free!
Ahmad, you are safe!
All of you!
Never fear, my little one.
We were more than a match for those cutthroats.
We must hurry to the river.
There is still danger.
In the village is a smithy where we can be rid of our chains.
Hurry, we must go quickly!
- Can he not work faster?
- Silence!
Don't sound like a frightened woman.
Even on that slave block, you were unafraid.
Fear and anger walk different roads.
By the beard of the prophet, you would have killed that slaver.
I would.
Only those who wear chains, know the joys of freedom.
Enough of this philosophy. What we need is speed! Should those slavers come...
- If you have the strength, O feeble one.
- O stomach of jelly!
If my wife were here, she could break you from your chains.
The boat is here, but the ferryman is afraid to take us across.
I will persuade him. Come to the boat as soon as you are ready.
I'm sure your wife would be more gentle.
You know this calls to mind an experience I once had.
Sinbad, this is no time for tales.
- Come. Sinbad will follow.
- What if the ferryman should refuse him?
He won't.
Ahmeen will not fail his friends.
Listen.
The slavers!
Quickly, hurry!
We must go quickly!
Hurry, hurry! Come on!
Lay down your arms.
In whose name?
In the name of Kamar Zaman, the Caliph of Bagdad.
- These are the men?
- Yes, lord, yes. I swear I did not know...
Silence!
Where is she?
Sherazade, where is she?
Sherazade... at last!
At last.
You see, my beloved, a city built on the sands of the desert to receive you.
This and all Bagdad shall be yours.
My lord, you should not enter that city.
If you'd be recognized...
Sherazade may need me.
Onward!
Salaam.
Salaam,
O commander of the faithful.
You see, Nadan, my search has been rewarded.
You are the chosen of Allah.
Sherazade, this is Nadan, my Grand Vizier and friend, as loyal as my right hand.
Peace and happiness be with you and your beloved, O my lady.
Nadan, prepare a feast that shall be remembered through the ages.
Let us have wine and music.
This is the day when only joy is in the tents of the Caliph.
Saleem will escort you to your quarters.
- What clothes!
- What luxury!
- What food!
- And you have me to thank for it all.
Sherazade had something to do with it.
May I get you something to eat?
There was no triumph in her eyes when she looked at me, only sadness.
- Only that, my lord?
- What else?
- Perhaps love.
- I dare to hope so.
While you had eyes only for
Sherazade, Nadan was watching.
I think he recognized you.
If he did, I must go to him and caution him to keep my secret from Sherazade.
She must not know who I am yet.
You cannot trust him!
He's loyal to Kamar.
- This is madness.
- Well, what would you have me do then?
Reveal yourself to your people, not to Nadan.
When they know you're alive, they will rise and restore you to the throne.
You there, you are wanted.
You must find Sherazade.
Tell her to have courage and I will keep my promise.
Come.
What do they want with him?
What has happened?
I'll try to find out.
This is the man, my lord.
You may leave us.
Wait outside.
Come closer.
I am told it was you who planned the escape from the slave market.
I played my part, my lord.
And that it was you who rescued
Sherazade from the man who bought her.
It was my fortune to be the first to reach her.
Perhaps that was because you had a stronger motive.
- What motive, my lord?
- The strongest of all, love.
Who am I to aspire to Sherazade, the chosen of Kamar?
Who or what you are is no matter.
Love can come to the lowliest and to the highest.
That is true, my lord.
But the lowliest can hardly dare to hope to be loved for himself alone...
- by one as far above him as the stars.
- Then you do love Sherazade.
- My lord, I did not say...
- I say it!
I watched you closely when she was with Kamar.
Your lips may lie now, but then your eyes told me the truth.
Arrest this man.
Not so fast, little one.
- Is it forbidden to enter there?
- Forbidden?
No man but the Caliph and the
Lord Vizier can enter the harem.
But I'm not a man.
I'm only a boy.
Boys grow fast.
Now be off with you!
You cannot loiter here.
Well? What are you staring at, son-of-a-frog?
At your magnificence,
O mightier than the moon.
I was thinking, when I grow up, I, too, might stand guard over the harem of the Caliph.
Make a prayer that you won't have to do it in such a heat as this.
Your kerchief is red and angry like the sun.
Perhaps if it were blue, it would be more cooling.
But I, I have no blue one.
- Now you have, O mighty one.
- Beelzebub! Magic!
- Doubtless, too, your honor is thirsty.
- As a goat in the desert!
Drink, my lord.
Now I'll make it vanish. Watch.
By Allah!
He, too, has vanished.
A boy! Catch him!
Catch him! Catch him!
- Bring him here. Show him to us.
- Let's see him!
No! Please let me go.
It is serious.
Don't be serious.
What brought you here?
- I came to find Sherazade.
- The new favorite.
- I bring her a message from...
- A lover?
Already a tryst!
We must help him.
If Kamar should find out, he'd be furious.
There's the tent of Sherazade.
We must move cautiously.
Let's hide him.
What are you doing there?
- What do we do now?
- What can we do?
Start a fight!
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
Get in the water.
Stop it, I say.
Stop it.
Come here! Come here!
Come here!
Here he comes!
Look at this one.
Just think of it. From now on, you can have everything you want.
Sherazade? Sherazade?
Sherazade?
Ali! I have come with a message from my master.
He said he will keep his promise.
But he's in great danger.
And he's heedless of that danger because of his love for you.
Make way, make way for the Grand Vizier.
Look!
You mustn't be found here.
Quick!
What is this man to you?
Is he your lover?
- I have loved no man.
- But he has admitted that he loves you.
- He said that?
- And you love him.
That isn't true!
Can't you understand?
She is Sherazade, whose dream it was to marry a king.
Why should she choose a humble player?
- Do you still deny he is your lover?
- Yes.
He came to us by chance before we were sold into slavery.
He will regret that escape from the tender mercies of those slavers.
Guard!
What are you going to do?
What will happen to him?
There are many ways that death can come to a man.
His will not be easy.
But he's our friend!
What has he done that he should die?
You really love him, do you not?
Yes, yes, I love him!
Help me. Save him.
I'll be your slave. Only save him!
If I save him,
I shall need your help.
What do you want me to do?
This ring.
You see?
Wear it.
At the feast, when the marriage cup is brought, the slave will already have tasted the wine. Kamar will suspect nothing.
As you pass your hands over the cup during the betrothal dance...
It should be easy.
- And he?
- I will sign an order for his release... and provide an escort as far as the border.
Once across the river, he should be quite safe.
Why are you doing this?
What will you gain?
My rightful place that belongs to the strongest.
The throne.
I have been a servant long enough.
Now I will be king.
Come, make up your mind!
How do I know you will keep your word?
You will see him leave the encampment yourself. Will that satisfy you?
Very well.
I will make the arrangements.
When the time comes,
I will let you know.
I have kept my bargain.
See that you keep yours.
He is to reach the other bank of the river safely, but then...
I understand, my lord.
- You expect us to believe all of that?
- You must believe it!
- Haroun-Al-Raschid!
- Haroun-Al-Raschid...
And I thought he was a beggar.
I asked him if he could juggle.
We must do something!
What can we do?
Haroun's safe conduct goes only as far as the river.
We must get there before the soldiers and hide the ferryboat.
I have a plan.
We'll go to the smithy and...
All we want is to borrow your smithy for an hour.
Borrow it?
- That's right.
- Don't worry. You'll be paid.
- You paid me nothing before.
- You paid him nothing?
- In that case, we'll double it.
- What?
Clear off, offspring of a beggar!
- Did you get the boat?
- Yes, we have it hidden downstream.
Good, good. Watch for the soldiers.
What's going on out there?
Ahmad! They are here.
The soldiers are coming.
Smith?
Oh, there you are.
We want the ferryboat.
- The ferryboat?
- Yes.
- Oh, oh, the, uh... the, uh, ferryboat.
- Yes.
- It's out of service.
- Out of service?
It's on account of the ferryman.
He's sick with confusionitis.
You see, for 25 years he's been going to and fro, and fro and to.
And most of the time he didn't know whether he was fro or to.
Have you ever been to when you were supposed to be fro?
- It makes you wish you'd never started.
- This isn't getting us anyplace.
That's exactly what the ferryman said to his wife after his 4,000th round-trip.
Oh, excuse me, but there's a woman in there... who used to know on which side of the river the ferryman lived.
I'll go in and ask her.
Oh, if you have to leave, don't go until you come back.
I can't hold off the corporal much longer.
The man's crazy!
That, that... that gives me an idea.
- One of you will have to be a woman.
- No!
I'll do it. When I was with the Strolling Players,
- I was known as the Bag of Bagdad.
- You can't do it with that beard.
Ridiculous! The woman that I loved most dearly had a beard like that.
The corporal isn't that crazy.
No, you'll have to shave it off.
My beard? Rather my life than my beard.
But it's Haroun's life that matters now. Valda.
No, no, no.
Off with the beard.
No, Valda, I forbid it.
I forbid it. Valda, don't!
The woman said, the last time she saw...
There's a horse with a split hoof.
See to it.
Who, me?
You! What's the matter with you?
- You're the smith, aren't you?
- Oh, uh... Yes, yes, yes.
Come on. I'll show you.
- He'll have to get down.
- Can't you manage without?
Without? Don't be ridiculous.
Don't you think I know my own trade?
Come on.
- Right this way, sir.
- Help bind him.
You'll be comfortable here.
You need not be gentle with that accursed one.
By the stars, this better be the one.
Allah, preserve us.
What was that?
- That was Sultana.
- A camel?
Oh, no. A woman, a very beautiful woman.
Oh? I'm going to look for the ferryman.
I'll come back later.
- Why don't you come back now?
- Well, I...
Don't begin that again.
Get on with your work.
Where did I put my anvil? Sultana, what have you done with my anvil?
Did you call, father?
Oh, I... I didn't know you had company.
What a beautiful distribution of flesh.
The most magnificent.
Not only the most magnificent, but the most.
Um... may I?
Coochi-coochi-coochi.
- I've stood enough.
- Not now. Wait 'til we get him in here.
Coochi-coochi-coochi.
- What's going on here?
- I only chucked her under the chin.
Which chin?
How dare you pay court to my beloved.
- Silly boy, takes so much for granted.
- Away with you!
I dare you to cross this threshold.
I defy you to enter here.
Aren't you going to accept his challenge?
- Oh, you do, do you?
- I double...
Peasant dreams.
Eedee, jedee, midee, moe.
Jedee, moe. The corporal, come.
Come quickly!
Come, the corporal!
Quick, go!
Come.
Wine! Wine! Come.
Wine. Wine.
Ali, what are you doing here?
Nadan ordered his soldiers to kill you at the river.
- Why did he pretend to free me?
- He made a bargain with Sherazade.
- What bargain?
- She agreed to poison Kamar's wine...
- in return for your safety.
- What does my safety mean to her?
She loves you, my lord, and she's in great danger.
Hurry, we must go quickly!
The soldiers are sleeping peacefully.
We await your commands,
O Mighty Caliph.
Ali, cross the river and rouse my people.
The rest of you, mount your horses and follow me.
Proceed.
Bring the wedding gifts.
We will drink to our betrothal.
- Sherazade.
- Ahmeen!
- Seize that man!
- Sinbad! Sinbad!
Sinbad!
Guards, stop them!
Do you not recognize me, my brother?
- Haroun.
- Haroun-Al-Raschid!
- The rightful Caliph!
- Haroun-Al-Raschid!
Haroun-Al-Raschid!
Why did you not tell me, my lord?
I could not until
I was sure of your love.
Her love?
Now, my brother, you condemned me to the slow death.
Yours shall be swift and sure.
By Allah!
This has got to be the one.
Beautiful lamp. Magic...
It worked! It worked!
The palace guard. Look!
Oh, no, you won't!
Oh, Sherazade.
Hail, Haroun-Al-Raschid!
The rightful monarch thus regained his throne.
There was great rejoicing throughout the land.
Sherazade and Haroun lived in peace and happiness all their days.
Did that really happen,
O Guardian of the Harem?
Of course it did.
Thus, as Allah had willed, so did it come to pass.
1840.
America's lifeline is the sea.
Railroads are almost unknown.
Only the great sailing ships link the busy states of New Engiand...
with the rich Mississippi Valley.
The sea, and the sea alone, makes America one nation.
But along this lane of commerce...
lie the shark-like teeth of the Florida Keys...
where savage hurricanes come screaming out of the Caribbean...
to drive tail ships onto the destroying shoals.
Here, storm-riding men and frail schooners...
the salvage masters of Key West...
stand guard beside America's lifeline.
They reap the harvest of the wild wind...
fighting the hurricanes to save lives and cargo from the wrecked vesseis.
But tales of great salvage profits...
have drawn reckless men to this dangerous harvest...
spawn of the seven seas.
So among Florida's heroic salvage masters...
appear lawless captains...
who plot to destroy, for their own profit...
the great ships they are pledged to save.
America's very future on the sea is being fought for...
beside the roaring reefs of Key West.
You men! Lash Capt. Stuart to the mizzen fife rail!
Breakers off the starboard bow!
Lay forward and rig a preventer stay!
I'll take the wheel.
Get going! Go on!
Breakers dead ahead!
I ain't through.
I'm gonna take out another ship.
While you're still a young man.
Hark, ye!
Who's hollering?
I don't know.
Quiet. It sounds to me like...
Wreck ashore!
Wreck ashore, men!
Sam! Loose your forestay sail and your mainsail and stand by.
Better move fast, Capt. Phil, or Cutler will beat us to our share again.
I'll be there. You single up.
Get the boss. We'll be ready.
Where did she take the bottom?
She won't be long in that sea!
Claiborne men, board!
What vessel struck?
Don't know. She'll soon break up.
What reef?
Claiborne men, look alive!
Be careful, Pa. And bring me back a nice piece of black silk for a Sunday dress.
Ahoy, Loxi!
Loxi Claiborne! You come right down from that widow's walk.
You'll blow away up there, Cousin Loxi.
Can you sight her, Loxi?
She's on Sambo Key, driven hard!
What ship?
Looks like the Jubilee of the Devereaux line.
She's breaking up fast, too.
Jubilee! Why her cargo's dead rich.
Come on, gal!
LOXl: I'm worried about the crew.
Crew?
Consarn it!
Ain't no money salvaging the crew!
You're not going out to that wreck!
Mercy! Stay covered.
LOXl: Bring along my petty skirt,
Drusilla honey.
Loxi, once and for all...
LOXl: I'm not going anyplace, hardly!
Maum Maria, help me rig for wrecking.
Now, Miss Loxi, you know what way your mama thinks... about you going after them wrecks.
Trying to make a lady out of her is keeping me wore to a shadow.
- Give me my sea boots.
- Your mama say...
Loxi, I forbid you.
The Cutlers won't pick the bones of this wreck, if I can help it.
- How will you stop them?
- We'll be broke if I don't.
What's Drusilla going to tell the family back in Havana?
We can't run a salvage business without salvage.
Loxi, I think you're so brave going out to that wreck.
Brave! Fiddle-de-dee! She's just pigheaded.
- Lf only your father were alive!
- Throw me that southwester.
If Father were alive,
I wouldn't be running the business.
Loxi!
You found your anchor?
Land o' Goshen! Crank on, will you?
LOXl: I'm coming, Capt. Phil.
Loxi, I worry every time you go a-wrecking.
The hurricane's all over, Mummy.
Your mama say you ain't going!
Maybe we better let her go.
Oh, the Nellie B's your packet and you're far away from home
And it breaks your back to tack it
Larboard, half a pint!
Haui away
Just the same as me
For you're nothing but a packet rat
Tail onto that foresheet and trim her!
Aye, Capt. Phil.
Aboard the Nellie B
Bread and water for your supper when you board the Nellie B
The Moro's fallen astern, Capt. Phil.
We'll speak the wreck ahead of them all!
- Wreck ho!
- Where away?
Dead ahead on Sambo Key!
And your blood runs down her scuppers in the briny, shiny
There she lies.
LOXl: The Falcon's lying close by.
LOXl: The Cutlers are there before us!
Them forecastle rats must've known.
No man alive can foretell a wreck.
Unless he plans it himself.
We'll get no part of her rich cargo.
Cutler and his brother are boarding her now.
- Come on. Get aboard.
- King, look there.
Put a shot across the bow of the Claiborne.
- Yeah. We salvage this wreck!
- Aye, aye, sir!
Ready? Turn your pipe into that touchhole.
Can't even shoot straight.
- Ram that pirate. Ram her, Capt. Phil!
- And sink us both?
- Land of love, gal! Heave to. Lower the dory.
- Aye, sir.
- That stopped them.
- Get to work on that cargo, Dan.
You Falcon men, break open that hatch.
I'm in command here.
Capt. Stuart's taking a little rest.
- We got hurt men aboard.
- We'll move them later.
- You'll move them now!
- My brother said later!
We're going to save this cargo for you, boys... whether you like it or not.
Forward!
- Have any trouble with the skipper?
- He never knew what hit him.
- I'm expecting a fat bit for this, Mr. Cutler.
- You'll be taken care of, Widgeon.
Here. Sign this.
Pull her close! Hang on, Loxi.
Ahoy, Cutler!
We demand salvage shares in this vessel.
I'm taking charge of the cargo.
You take the crew.
Ain't no pay for that, you benighted blowfish!
- Take them anyway. He'd let them drown!
- All right!
Jump into the mizzen and rig the crow jack yard.
Aye, Dan.
Make it lively!
Get off me, you filthy...
Quick! Give me an oar.
The poor little fellow.
Grab it! There's a squid out there!
Poor fellow.
Here, take him. Set me aboard that hulk.
Now, Loxi!
Has the water got to that cargo?
Who pitched that little monkey into the sea?
Get off this deck, or there'll be two of you in the sea.
You weaselling crimp!
I'll coil your rope for you!
Over the side, you men!
What'll we do? Walk?
The Claiborne's waiting.
- Who's that?
- The skipper.
You better get him off before we start swinging cargo.
Get your men off this ship!
Larboard to helm! Larboard your...
Don't fret your head till it's in one piece again.
Widgeon! Where's that...
Take it easy.
The salvage boats are standing by.
Lie still. They're taking off the crew now.
- Who are you? What're you doing here?
- I'll be here just as long as you need me.
I hope that'll be a long time.
Bringing the man in here, that's charity.
But bringing the ape, that's obnoxious.
Fifty percent? Why, that's piracy.
It's legal. Your mate signed it.
The Jubilee was 15 months at sea.
You salvaged her cargo in a few hours and want 50%.
And get it.
If your owners break you, come to me.
I'll show you how to own your own ship in a year.
Yes, and hang him, too. I brung your duffel.
Where would your cargos be if it weren't for me and my ships?
- Maybe still afloat.
- What do you mean, you little cultch?
I'll bust you in...
LOXl: No. The door's over there, Mr. Cutler.
And it's open.
- You're not a good loser, Miss Loxi.
- Not to you, Mr. Cutler.
Here, drink this.
If your owners do break you, Capt. Stuart, look me up.
Smoking in the house.
Now go on, drink it.
I sworn to man, that feller would sink his own grandmother... to salvage the gold in her teeth.
You're not saying he pushed that reef in front of my ship, are you?
No. I'm saying he's a bad Yankee.
I'm a good one.
Where'd you get that mate, Widgeon?
We took him on in Havana.
I see.
If I thought that wreck was planned...
I'd make a topsail out of Cutler's hide.
You hark to me, sonny.
The 10 years I've been at Key West... sailing master for the Claiborne family,
I have seen them go broke... flatter than the shadow of a clam.
Same as all the other honest salvage masters.
Run out by thieves and cutthroats, and that shark Cutler's their boss.
No more bilge talk.
Now, you up anchor and let him rest.
What you need is some nourishment.
Smells like burning hair.
You fold that right back!
Yes, quite a lady's man, ain't he?
I'm afraid Bananas is only used to forecastles.
Is this your room?
Yes. Does it bother you being in a lady's bedroom?
Drusilla's in the guest room.
Bother me? Took me a long time to be sure I wasn't in heaven.
She ain't no angel.
Here. Come down from there.
- How many sugars?
- Three.
I feel like a hulk, putting you to so much trouble.
Shucks.
You stop looking at me and eat your dinner.
I was just remembering where I saw you before.
- Under a southwester?
- No.
You sort of came out of that storm like one of Mother Carey's chickens... only, you were good luck for me.
Loxi!
Your mama's calling.
Maum Maria, see he cleans his plate.
I'll be back soon as I can.
You got no call to hurry.
He ain't going nowhere.
Scat! I'm feeding this one.
He's mighty handsome, Cousin Loxi.
A man like that would rather lose his life than his ship.
Why do you all hate Mr. Cutler so?
LOXl: Because he needs hanging a little.
Cousin Loxi?
- His brother's different, isn't he?
- Different front name, that's all.
What are you studying about Dan Cutler for?
I'm not. Really, I'm not.
I thought girls raised in Havana never even looked at men... till they were married to them.
Drusilla, is Loxi there?
LOXl: I'm coming, Mummy.
I'll be up in a minute.
Dan!
What do you want?
Hello, you lovely little carrot-top.
Dan, I was so afraid.
I'm afraid every time I take you in my arms.
Why?
Because I want to crush the life out of you.
When I'm in your arms,
I don't care what they say about you.
I'll love you always, Dan. Always.
Going to lay down this heavy load
By and by
By and by
Going to lay down this heavy load
By and by
By and by
Time will come when my troubies are gone
No more toting these sacks of corn
- You left your spyglass at our house.
- Loxi.
I was coming over to thank your mother for...
Mother's making a heap of to-do about you and me.
They're planning to ship me off to visit Aunt Henrietta.
I got my orders, too.
I sail tonight on the Arcturus.
A month at sea and then Charleston.
- Charleston?
- For a showdown with Steve Tolliver.
You'll be in Charleston?
Why, that's where Aunt Henrietta...
LOXl: Oh...
LOXl: Who's Steve Tolliver?
He drips lace, and leads the Charleston quadrilles.
What?
He's sea lawyer for Devereaux and Company.
He loves me about as much as the devil loves holy water.
- But he doesn't sound very dangerous.
- He wouldn't be... except he holds the power of influence with old Commodore Devereaux.
But Commodore Devereaux's fair and square.
He's fair and square, but old.
If you keep doing that,
I'm going to fall right into them.
Trying to frighten me?
You know, Loxi, there's only three things I want out of life.
One is to command the Southern Cross, a steam.
- Steam.
- Don't turn up your pretty nose at steam.
It's the future of the seas... when calms and gales and fog won't mean a thing.
And with the Southern Cross under me,
I'd get my second wish... because the man who commands in steam... will be the head of
Devereaux and Company someday.
Will you have to wear a stovepipe hat, Jack?
Steve Tolliver looks all right in one.
He means to be head of the company himself.
I was the one man in his way.
Now that I've lost the Jubilee... he'll crack down with everything he's got to break me.
Break you? That's a man-size job.
I promise you, he won't do it.
I've found something in these Keys worth fighting for.
Nights on watch, I'll see you like this, Loxi... with your hair catching fire in the sunset... and that look in your eyes 10 fathoms deep.
What was the third thing you wanted, Jack?
Think I'm going to say "you," don't you?
- Aren't you?
- Yes.
You're in my blood, Loxi, same as the sea.
I'm coming back for you.
You won't have to come back.
I'll be waiting for you in Charleston.
They're not going to break you...
and you're gonna have the Southern Cross.
- You're starting to tell my future?
- It's our future, Jack.
Of course, Commodore Devereaux, you need a mighty experienced captain...
to navigate a fine ship like the Southern Cross, steam and all that.
That ain't got no elegance.
You are in Charleston.
Ladies don't tell gentlemen. They ask them.
It was really you I came up to see,
Commodore Devereaux.
All the way from Key West.
There's Mrs. Mottram's house.
Aunt Henrietta's waiting on the porch.
- Button that mitten.
- Do you suppose it'll work?
Do you suppose he'll listen about Capt. Jack?
Of course, child.
Only just don't leave your right hand know what your left feet is doing.
'Twill bring me back
one golden hour
Through many
Through many a weary year
i may not
to the world impart
A tale of me and you apart
- Elizabeth.
- Henrietta, this is mighty pleasant.
This is my little niece Loxi from Key West.
- This is her cousin Drusilla.
- What lovely girls.
- Mrs. Mottram, I...
- Ivy is singing.
Save for the little faded flower
But oh how fondly dear
Which do you think is Commodore Devereaux?
He must be here.
But I never saw a less seagoing run of shad in my whole life.
Through many
Through many a weary year
Lovely, Ivy. So tender.
I want you to meet Loxi Claiborne,
Drusilla Alston.
- This is our own Ivy Devereaux.
- Commodore Devereaux's daughter.
Charleston must seem quite different to you after the wild life of Key West.
I can see you two will be the best of friends.
- This is Capt. Carruthers.
- Charmed.
Miss Loxi Claiborne, Mr. Stephen Tolliver.
Come, Drusilla. I want you to meet some of our Charleston beaus.
Charmed, Miss Loxi.
This is Romulus.
Miss Loxi Claiborne, Mr. Romulus Tolliver.
Charmed, Miss Loxi.
Speaks pointedly good English, don't you think?
Considering his mother spoke nothing but Gaelic.
I saw it... I saw your lips move.
She's lovely, isn't she?
What a wonderful pair of performing dogs.
I've heard a lot about Steve Tolliver.
LOXl: In Key West.
Well, we're flattered.
You're jumping to conclusions, Mr. Tolliver.
Now, who's been telling you stories about Steve?
One of the finest men I ever met,
Capt. Jack Stuart.
That's rather a sore subject with Romulus.
You see, Capt. Stuart sat on Romulus once.
And he weighs 200 pounds.
Ivy, I'd be happy if you'd introduce me to your father.
I'm sorry. My father's not here.
Commodore is very ill. His doctor won't allow him out of the house.
Then who runs the Devereaux Company?
I do, lady, with a little help from Steve.
You run it?
Loxi, dear... your aunt speaks of nothing but those charming Florida ballads you sing so well.
- Won't you...
- I couldn't. Why, I just couldn't!
Romulus and I are very partial to sentiment.
Attention, everybody, please.
Miss Claiborne is going to sing one of those sweet ballads of Key West.
Charming.
Steve and I would love to hear one of those soft moonlight-on-the-sea songs.
Perhaps a breath of Key West would be refreshing... to all of us.
Oh, the Nellie B's your packet
When you're far away from home
And it breaks your back to tack it
O'er the briny, shiny foam
But heave ho, haui away
Just the same as me
For you're just another packet rat
Aboard the Nellie B
Bread and water for your suppers when you board the Nellie B
And your blood runs from her scuppers in the briny shiny sea
But heave ho, haui away
Just the same as me
For you're just another packet rat
Aboard the Nellie B
Oh, her mate he'll talk so civil
But he'll rob ya in your sleep
There's no uglier a devil in the briny, shiny deep
But heave ho, haui away
- Is that Elizabeth's idea of a sweet ballad?
- Mighty salty.
You're just another packet rat
Aboard the Nellie B
Do you sing, too?
LOXl: For that galley growilng crew
For the bos'n is a dirty son of a
Shiny, briny biue!
So heave ho, haui away
Just the same as me
For you're just another packet rat
Aboard the Nellie B
Oh, the
Loxi, please.
Come, Barbara.
She has a lovely voice, but...
- But, Auntie, there's still 20 more verses.
- Oh, my goodness.
I'd love to hear them all.
- How could you know such a song?
- I learned it from a pirate friend.
- With rings in his ears?
- In his nose.
I'm afraid Loxi is a little, un peu exaltée!
I find her exaltation most charming.
May I hear the rest of the song soon?
I hope so.
It's just hopeless.
Making a lady out of you is just hopeless.
Drusilla, I can do it.
I can do everything I came here to do.
Cousin Loxi, you're playing with gunpowder.
I don't need Commodore Devereaux.
I don't need anybody.
Because I can wrap that Steve Tolliver around my little finger.
And I'm going to do it.
Oh, who's gonna row my honey
Who's going to row my honey
Yes, who's going to row
my honey
When i'm
gone away
And who's going to be
your true love
Who's going to be
That's the third time they've been together this week.
What if...
Yes, who's going to be
your true love
When i'm
gone away
When i'm
gone away
- And then what happened?
- There she'd gone telling everyone... the bonnet had just come off the packet from France, when they...
- Pull up, Caesar!
- What are you stopping for, Ivy?
I declare! They're together again.
That's the 13th time.
Go on, Caesar.
Yes, Miss Ivy. Giddap.
They're lovely.
Like ships in the water, aren't they?
Yes, lovely.
Steve, there's something I most especially want to talk to you about.
- You took the words right out of my mouth.
- Romulus generally does that.
I'm a little worried about Romulus.
He's been a changed dog ever since the Mottram tea.
You're just another packet rat Aboard the Nellie B
Quit it, Steve.
Now this is important.
It's about the Southern Cross.
What I have to say is much more important than the Southern Cross.
- But she's the newest ship in the line.
- Yes, I know. And she's steam and all.
But she's hardly fitted for a honeymoon.
Honeymoon?
LOXl: But, Steve, you don't mean it.
Yes, I do, Loxi.
When you walked into Mrs. Mottram's tea party... it was like all the winds of the Caribbean.
I was shipwrecked at once.
But, Steve, I...
My whole life is Key West.
This is another world to me.
There's only one world, Loxi, inhabited by two people.
I spoke to your aunt last night.
Mr. Tolliver!
Mr. Tolliver!
Here's trouble on horseback.
Mr. Tolliver, sir. Pardon, ma'am.
You're wanted at the counting house at once, sir.
Commodore Devereaux is already on his way there.
- Has Dr. Jepson gone insane?
- Yes, sir. He asks you to come at once.
- I thought the Commodore was gravely ill.
- He is, ma'am.
But the moment he heard
Capt. Jack Stuart had landed...
Dr. Jepson said no mortal means could keep the Commodore at home.
Steve, couldn't you spare just a moment...
to hear what I was going to say about the Southern Cross?
I see the Commodore isn't the only one interested in Capt. Stuart's arrival.
I'll take your horse, Bixby.
You return in the carriage.
Yes, sir.
Romulus will escort you home, Loxi.
But I want most of your dances at Mrs. Mottram's ball tonight.
Good day, Mr. Stephen.
The Commodore was so disturbed by the wrecks at Key West...
- I've twice had to bleed him.
- Stuart with him?
He is, and I fear the Commodore will have a stroke.
Don't talk to me of barratry when you've got no proof!
In short, sir, you were not only unconscious when your ship struck...
- but you don't know what hit you.
- I've already said...
I'm not interested in excuses!
I'm interested in performance.
Take up the model of your command, sir.
Put her in Rotten Row.
Put her with the rest of the fine ships... that you and your kind have sent to rot on the bottom!
And take your eyes off the Southern Cross.
We don't want her turned into kindling!
- You can cat-haul me both ways...
- Choke your luff.
Wait outside.
I'm only asking...
I said outside!
Commodore Devereaux.
Really you mustn't. Here. Drink this.
I'm all right, Doctor.
That'll do you a world of good.
Here.
Don't coddle me. I'm no derelict.
You look strong as a bull, sir. Why don't you come down first thing next week...
That Jack Stuart has cost us...
It wasn't Jack Stuart who cost us the Jubilee, sir.
It was those Florida reefs.
Am I to remove the reefs, or the captains who can't miss them?
Perhaps you should remove the Key West pirate wreckers... who swarm those reefs like a school of killer whales.
And get rid of the man who's behind them all: King Cutler.
Are we to go out of business because we can't hang Cutler?
He got 50°% of the Jubilee's cargo.
Cutler or no Cutler,
I'll get my ships through!
- Lf I have to hire and fire...
- Commodore, please.
Don't coddle me.
Gentlemen, I asked Lt. Farragut to sit with us today... hoping the United States Navy may give us protection... against Cutler and his kind.
We need some sort of protection.
Better than one ship a week is piling up on those reefs.
At a cost of $5 million a year.
Yes, sir, and more.
Gentlemen, the Navy is more anxious than you are...
- to blast those vultures out of the Keys.
- Good.
But you present no evidence against this man Cutler.
Give us proof of deliberate wrecking.
We'll do the rest.
Proof?
No one dares testify against Cutler.
We sent men down there to find witnesses.
- What became of them?
- I don't know, sir.
But I suggest that you send one man more.
- Who, for instance?
- Me, for instance.
You? Why, Tolliver, you wouldn't last
15 minutes in that pirate's nest.
You're a lawyer, not a gunboat.
But the gunboats won't come until we get proof.
Gunboats or no gunboats, if we don't stop that gang mighty soon... the American flag won't be at many mastheads.
- But I don't favour losing a good sea lawyer.
- Thank you.
I know Cutler, Steve.
You wouldn't stand any more chance than a rat in a tar barrel.
Confound it. If they kill him, he's not the man for the job.
That's very aptly put, sir.
Perhaps Jack Stuart could sail south with me.
The Southern Cross is refitting at Havana.
If you'll recall...
You'd give the Southern Cross to the man who just lost us the Jubiiee?
Gentlemen, we're in business.
Capt. Stuart has increased the earnings of every vessel he's commanded.
Twice he's weathered typhoons in the China Sea.
And he's broken the record from Rio to Martinique.
I personally don't like him, but he gets the most out of a ship.
And then throws it away on a Florida reef.
I expect to get proof that Cutler, not Stuart, wrecked the Jubiiee.
You expect.
Don't you?
Ormsby, order Capt. Stuart to proceed to Key West immediately...
as mate of the Peiican.
There he'll be set ashore without pay, to await orders.
- But that's unfair.
- You'll have his papers in your pocket.
If you find proof that clears him, give him the Southern Cross.
- You're a great old sea lion. I'll tell him.
- You'll do nothing of the sort.
Let him sweat on the beach, and see how he takes it.
And my personal opinion of you is that you're a young fool.
Thank you, sir.
You'll never leave Key West alive.
But I have to.
You see, I expect to be married.
Well!
What's her name?
Gentlemen.
You'd better hurry before you start to Key West.
Who's the lucky girl, Steve?
I'm so sorry about your nice sea captain.
Father told me.
Too bad.
Loxi, he's waiting for you by the round window in the vestibule. Jack.
And he looks like a thundercloud.
Capt. Carruthers, would you want to do something for me?
- Command me, Miss Loxi.
- Excuse me for a minute, will you, please.
I watched for your ship every single day.
That dress makes you sparkle like sun on water.
Jack, tell me.
How did it go with the Commodore?
I think they've got me busted flatter than a haddock.
But your new command.
Aren't they going to give you the...
The Southern Cross?
Might as well be dry-docked on the moon.
They put me on the Pelican.
The Pelican! They're asking you to command that old pigboat?
Command? I'm second mate.
- Second mate! Why, of all the...
- We sail within the hour for Key West.
They're beaching me there till I dry-rot.
No, Jack. Nobody's going to break us up that easy.
That's what he's trying to do.
- He? Who?
- Wait here for a minute, will you, please.
Mr. Tolliver's bitten off just a little bit more than he's going to be able to chew.
Observe closely this harmless-looking little object.
- Just look here what Steve's got.
- What is it, a toothpick?
- No, they call them matches.
- Matches. What are they for?
I'll show you.
Carruthers, loan me the sole of your boot.
- Goodness gracious!
- Mr. Tolliver, they're terrifying!
I'm hanged.
Do another, Steve.
I'd adore to do one, Steve.
Cousin Steve, you do get the quaintest things.
They'll never be popular, Tolliver.
Too dangerous.
This is ours, I believe.
May I claim this, Miss Thomas?
May I have the honour?
I'd love it.
I was just coming to beg you for this dance.
LOXl: I'd like to speak to you out on the balcony.
- Like Romeo and Juliet?
- Not exactly.
Henrietta, do you allow your niece to wander off un-chaperoned?
Oh, my dear.
I've been just bubbling over with excitement all day.
Mr. Tolliver's asked for Loxi's hand.
Ettie, Loxi and Mr. Tolliver.
Oh, my goodness! That is news.
Engaged? Stephen?
- To that little savage from Key West?
- She's a pretty little savage.
Moonlight and magnolias.
Just fits what I want to say to you.
What you've done is the most cowardly thing I've heard of.
- Coming to the races tomorrow?
- I hope your filly wins, Col. Ogier.
Bound to.
It's vicious, and low and cruel.
You're very desirable when you're angry.
You think you're mighty clever.
Putting Jack on an old tub, beaching him in Key West...
Easy now, what really happened...
What really happened was that you saw I loved Jack Stuart.
- No, I didn't see that.
- Oh, yes, you did. And you're right.
I love him. I'll marry him.
You're stabbing him in the back...
That's enough.
In the first place, you're not in love with him.
And in the second,
I intend to marry you myself.
- Well, upon my word.
- No. Upon my word.
Do you think after knowing one real man like Jack Stuart, just one... that a girl would even look at a namby-pamby popinjay like you?
For the past month or more... you haven't seemed to have found my ways distasteful.
Well, if I played up to you, it was so you wouldn't break Jack, that's all.
So you'd give him command of the Southern Cross, and no other reason.
I see.
What are you taking your gloves off for?
I take it you prefer the rough ways of your Key West pirates.
I'll be leaving now.
I'm sorry to delay you, but there's something you need very badly.
LOXl: Don't you put your hands on me!
Steve, stop it! How dare you! Stop it, I say!
LOXl: Let me go!
Let me up! Why you!
Oh.
You sorry, insufferable nincompoop.
If I only had a horsewhip.
Excuse me, please.
Loxi, dear child, we've just heard.
I'm so happy for you.
- Congratulations, Miss Loxi.
- That's nice of you.
- We just heard, Loxi.
- When's the wedding?
- You're a very lucky girl.
- Charleston will be green with envy.
I shall be a good loser, Miss Loxi, and offer Steve my congratulations.
Mighty clever of you, Tolliver.
Thank you very much, George.
- You're shot with luck.
- You're certainly full of surprises.
Yes, I'm a little surprised myself.
- Steve, it's so romantic.
- Yes, isn't it?
Steve's such a fine catch.
Steve? Why...
Please, everyone, listen.
LOXl: I haven't any idea how all this started, but it isn't true what you've heard.
You've all been very kind to me here in Charleston.
But there's a rumour going around this room that must be stopped right now.
I can't.
I won't have my name linked with a...
You've been very gracious to me... congratulating me on my engagement to be married... and wishing me so much happiness.
I thank you all for it.
What's come over the child?
Why, I never in all my born days.
Yes, I am going to be married.
But I'm gonna marry a real man.
A man that can ride out a southwester and clew up a topsail.
Not a lace-ruffled bullying jaybird like...
LOXl: Jack!
Loxi, how could...
Somebody get some water.
The skipper will marry us before we sail.
Steve's well rid of her.
Look at Steve Tolliver's face.
A hard pill for Steve to swallow.
He won't swallow it. Not Steve.
Lively with those winches!
Put your weight into it, you bilge rats!
- Skipper, Miss Claiborne.
- How do you do?
- Maum Maria isn't here with my things yet.
- I'm sorry, we haven't...
Not the topsail halyards! The gaff sail lift!
You lumps of hardtack weevil! Join hands!
Excuse me, ma'am. Join hands.
Blood of the devil!
What're you doing up there?
You mangy hunks! Grab that halyard!
Come on, you!
Heave!
- Let's get on with it, Skipper.
- But we're on the wrong side.
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here... "
It's foul at the block!
Did you never walk a footrope before?
"I require...
"I require and charge you both... "
- Skip that part.
- All right.
Jack, do you take this woman for your lawfui wedded wife?
- I do.
- And...
What's her name?
Loxi.
Loxi, do you take this man for your lawful wedded husband? And do you solemnly...
Suffering shadrack, what's that?
Looks like a runaway!
Reckon he's boarding us?
That's what he's doing.
Let go your fore-back spring!
Say, ain't that Mister...
Get back to work!
- Somebody's coming aboard!
- Stop yawing and finish off.
Loxi, do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
No! She does not.
We've got no need of a lawyer.
I be striving to get underway.
I'll take you home now, Loxi.
Get off this ship.
Look at that!
Jake, somebody's fighting.
- I've taken all I'm gonna take from you.
- Not quite.
Ain't she a hellcat?
What's he doing?
You can't go around bullyragging!
Put me down! Jack!
Are you crazy, Stuart?
He's the owner!
Jack!
Watch out, mate, he'll hogtie you!
Spit in his eye, mate!
Look at that one.
Jack!
There you are.
- Shall I set her back, Mr. Tolliver?
- No, keep underway.
Aye, sir.
I'll come on another ship.
- Don't touch me.
- Put your hand on my shoulder and relax.
Heave ho the forestay sail.
Heave ho!
- You coward! You irresponsible ruffian.
- The water's warm, isn't it?
What right do you think you've got to keep me from sailing with my husband?
He's not your husband.
You didn't say "I do. "
What? I will right now. Jack! L...
- Jack!
- Oh, come now.
Charleston packet sure got quality folks aboard this trip.
Let her drop.
Load it on.
Give her more slack.
Steady now.
Stand by the stern line.
That's him. There, with the lapdog.
Oh, my goodness, where's Drusilla?
I'll go find her. I ain't got nothing to do.
There she is, with two red pennants and her top rigging.
- Loxi dear!
- Mummy! Hello, Mummy.
We'll come ashore as soon as we find Drusilla.
Dan.
Oh, Dan!
Dan, be careful.
Wear this for me tonight.
I reckon I didn't see what I just seen.
Come along, child.
Capt. Phil, I brought you the most...
Where's Jack Stuart, Capt. Phil?
He's out on a diving job.
He'll be back tonight if his hat don't leak.
Drusilla! Wherever have you been?
What a lovely shawl.
That's the only thing
I ain't been asked to carry.
- Have you enjoyed your trip, Mr. Tolliver?
- Yes, very pleasant indeed.
LOXl: Capt. Phil!
Sir, I want to know.
Here, here. It's an epidemic.
Those double topsails get at least two knots more out of her.
Hurry with the cargo, boys.
Easy. Easy there.
She handles much easier, too.
I can see Charleston in the cut of your jib.
Hold it.
Steve, look out! Jump!
Don't faint, child.
I'm as white as a sheet myself.
Romulus, we have arrived.
Clear the gangplank. Keep calm.
That molasses came near being flavoured with Tolliver.
LOXl: Steve, are you hurt?
We've made an impression at last.
- I was only worried about the dog.
- We're both very grateful.
- I hope you found your mother well.
- Look after the dog, will you, Capt. Phil.
That was a close call, my friend.
Let me congratulate you.
Mr. Tolliver, this here's Mr. King Cutler.
You two men maybe heard about one another.
Oh, Tolliver. Well.
As one lawyer to another, let me welcome you to Key West.
- Thank you, that was quite a welcome.
- I saw it. Unpardonable.
Terrible waste of molasses.
I didn't know you practiced law,
Mr. Cutler... although I've heard of your other practices.
It is gratifying to know that our services to ships in distress have not gone unnoticed.
Unnoticed? I'm sure every ship owner in the world... would like to repay you for your efforts.
- Can I take you to the inn?
- Why...
You might go in, but you'll never come out.
You have many talents, Mr. Tolliver.
I hope I can make your visit to the Keys interesting.
I'm sure you'll do you best, Mr. Cutler.
Good day.
Good day.
- Take good care of him, Philpott.
- Yeah.
Take it away.
Give me a little more line.
You happen to know some nice quiet nook where I can sleep without any molasses?
Nook? I guess we can find a cranny somewhere for you.
Better leave word who to notify in case there's any suddenness.
Come on.
It's port.
That's larboard to me.
When I say it's port, it's port.
- You the mate of the whaler Tyfib?
- That's right.
- Still need men?
- Yeah.
They're scarcer than feathers on a frog.
- How long you going for?
- That's up to the whales.
- About three years.
- Shut up.
- I'll sell you a couple of men.
- What's the matter with them?
One's an able seaman.
The other will do any legal work you might have.
Legal work?
You mean, like boiling blubber?
- When do I get them?
- Tonight. Widgeon will tell you where.
- How much?
- $12 a head.
We'll pay when we pick them up.
Hope they both got arms.
Legal work!
Shut up!
Widgeon, you and The Lamb find out where Tolliver puts up.
Take four horn-fisted galley growlers and pay him a little visit.
That Charleston lawyer's the most dangerous man... they've ever sent down here.
But The Lamb will know how to tame him.
I wish your mama would have sent for you before I got all your clothes unpacked.
Maum Maria, what are the voodoo drums beating for tonight?
Long about dusk, I'd seen something.
- Couldn't be in this world, nor the next.
- Fiddlesticks.
It weren't no fiddlesticks.
It was shaped like Miss Drusilla... and it was traipsing along the edge of the jungle with a demon.
Only the demon make himself look like Dan Cutler.
But that's ridiculous.
Course, Miss Drusilla. The drums do that.
Drusilla, look me in the eyes.
Loxi, I wish I didn't have to go back to Havana tomorrow.
Are you meeting Dan Cutler on the sly?
Are you?
Drusilla, honey, he's...
You love Jack, and you ran away to marry him.
I love Dan.
And I'm gonna marry him, even if I have to run away, too.
Drusilla, darling...
I'm a pretty poor one to be giving advice.
But you go on back to Havana and ask your mother about it first.
Land of mercy!
I wish you'd inherited a talking dog instead of this scratching ape.
Mr. Tolliver's not likely to make me his heir.
Hear them drums? Maybe he gonna be needing an heir by morning.
- What have you heard?
- All I know is what the darkies say.
I suppose Steve Tolliver is in more trouble.
Yes, ma'am. But this here's his last trouble.
What about Steve? What is it you know?
The Lamb is getting him off of Capt. Phil's old sponge boat...
- and selling him to a whaler.
- A whaler?
Maybe they get Capt. Phil, too, if they catch him alive.
But that's terrible. We've got to warn them.
Who you mean, "we"?
I ain't going out into no voodoo night.
Nor none of the other darkies neither.
LOXl: You scared cats, I'll go myself.
No.
Get me a lantern.
Your mama would sell me if she knew.
Cousin Loxi, you can't.
LOXl: Lend me a shawl, Drusilla.
- Not that one.
- Why?
Here.
I thought you didn't like Steve.
LOXl: It's Capt. Phil I'm thinking about.
- Jack.
- There she is, Parson.
She is pretty.
Full rigged and with a masthead light.
What's your course?
You always turn up when I need you most.
I've been on a diving job.
I brought along the parson to finish...
I'm sorry, but Jack's gotta go right down to Capt. Phil's boat.
- Steve's in trouble.
- Steve? Steve Tolliver?
Now, don't get your mule streak up.
Cutler's selling Steve to a whaler.
- What do you care what happens to him?
- You ninny. This is no time to be jealous.
But I brought along...
But there's no time for parsons now.
Will you go or not?
Sure, I'll go.
No, Jack, I don't trust you.
I'm going with you.
I don't care what he did. He doesn't deserve what Cutler will do to him.
Sorry, Parson.
I want a church wedding, anyway.
Someone's moving out to it now.
Feller come now.
Muffle the rest of them tholes.
Yes, sir, this here old soup ladle here belongs to me.
I hired it out to a feller to fish for sponges.
What in tarnation can a man do with a sponge?
- You can't eat it.
- No, they haven't much flavour.
- What happened to the man?
- Went broke, of course.
- What's that?
- Maybe sea gulls.
If they're sea gulls, they're wearing boots.
Take that side.
Chinkapin, cover the light.
Here, take this.
LOXl: Capt. Phil. Steve.
That's Loxi.
Capt. Phil,
I've been having conniptions about you.
Loxi, you shouldn't have come down here.
No? Of course, it's no concern of mine... but Cutler's got you booked for a three years' cruise aboard a whaler.
My, this old tub sure needs a brush of paint,
Capt. Phil.
- You mean a shanghai?
- So she says.
Got so a man ain't safe in his own grave.
What sort of a fool are you bringing her down here?
I'm under my own orders.
Nobody but an iron-headed sap would make her witness to a shanghai attempt.
I'll have just about time to jam that down your throat.
- There's no time for fighting now.
- Look at that dog.
I don't want no killing.
Can't get a dime for no dead men.
Get Loxi out through the galley skylight.
LOXl: I can fight.
Don't argue!
I'm getting out of here!
Got a gun?
No.
Get in there.
You come gentle, or we got to bust your bones.
Widgeon. Why, you double-crossing carrion shark.
- That's your mate of the Jubilee?
- Yes. And working with Cutler.
You!
Don't let him get away!
Let go of me!
- Get down after them!
- Put up your hooks there, my friends.
You boys just cool your heels there for a minute.
Ain't nothing down beiow. Few sponges.
You don't want that knife!
Get off of me!
Don't go away. Don't back up.
You stinking swab!
Let's keep it short.
Devil fire!
You crawling crab!
Thanks.
I'm saving you for myself.
Let me go!
Get him!
Watch that fellow with the club.
- Why don't you shoot?
- I can't. I'm scared of hitting one of our men.
- Quit shoving.
- Quit missing.
Don't get up or I'll empty this pepperbox in you.
Blistering blazes.
- Capt. Phil, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.
Only I want my legs two inches longer.
LOXl: No, you don't.
Drop that, and get your hands up.
How can I get my hands up, you walleyed...
Come out of there, consarn you!
Get your hands up!
Over against the mast.
Come on, you crabs!
Make them fast.
You're going, too, bright eyes.
You've seen too much.
I hope this cures you of traipsing around.
You've been pulling strings all your life,
Mr. Lawyer.
Why don't you pull one now?
I might net myself a lot of trouble.
Shut your clam traps.
You boys will like whaling... if you can stand the stink.
Look out!
Hold the net down!
Jack, behind you, look!
Steve, look!
Steve, do something!
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Roll out of there now.
Keep your noses to the deck.
Pass a line around this octopus, will you?
You don't like Lamb, do you?
Neither do I.
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.
You make a lovely good Samaritan.
Didn't you scare yourself fighting like that?
Your sailor boy brought you to a right lively party.
- Yeah? Well...
- Now.
Wildcats could sure take fighting lessons from you, Jack.
- Sorry Widgeon got away.
- So am I.
Widgeon being here with Cutler's men...
should prove to your Charleston stiff necks that Jack didn't wreck the Jubilee.
I'm one stiff neck it satisfies.
Ahoy, Widgeon!
Who's there?
Whaler Tyfib coming for the men you promised.
- You can take your...
- Shut up.
All clear!
- Why you cuttle-head...
- Leave it to me, will you?
- You and Loxi get below.
- Come on, Jack.
Come alongside.
Hoist oars.
Where's Widgeon?
He's drunk.
Boat oars.
Cutler promised some able seamen.
We got five.
Five?
- Great day in the morning! Where are they?
- Right there.
Fellow will be glad to know them sponges finally come in handy.
They'll probably have quite a flavour before you boys get where you're going.
Pretty, ain't they? Go get them.
Wait a minute. How much?
How much? Cutler said $12 a head.
- Hold on. He said $12.
Take them or leave them.
At such prices, they're scarcely worth the picking.
You're a pirate and a thief, but it's a deal.
Bear a hand there.
You've got to give the devil his due.
He's clever.
Clever enough to want you.
- It's only $55.
- I know it.
Heave them over. Head and scale.
Don't break them oars!
This walrus weighs as much as a tonne.
I sworn to man, his feet's the biggest things
I ever seen without lungs.
Glad I ain't paying for that one by the pound.
If he gets rough, tap him with this.
He's singing to you, Lumpy.
Singing like a seal.
Heave him over.
- Jack, that paper has your name on it.
- What?
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Maybe it's a love letter.
You're talking through your crow's nest.
He's chewing on that sponge something awful.
He'll be chewing salt pork tomorrow.
Heave him over.
Jack, it's your appointment.
The Southern Cross.
- Jack, you're captain.
- That's what it is, all right, but...
Stow him in the bow, Lumpy.
No, wait!
- Here's $10 for yourself to remember us by.
- You ain't no pinch gut.
Shove off. Lay into it.
Don't unloosen them till you're out to sea.
They're a little mite tough.
They'll be tender
'fore they get back.
There, but for the grace of Loxi, go I.
She's a great girl, Philpott.
Steve Tolliver, I think you're the most contemptible man I ever met.
What's the matter?
Did I sell them too cheap?
Who's gonna command the Southern Cross,
Mr. Tolliver?
Oh.
- How long have you been carrying this?
- Since I left Charleston.
- Well! When were you gonna give it to him?
- When I got ready.
Commodore Devereaux gave you that appointment to give to Jack.
- Why didn't you give it to him?
- I had my reasons.
And I know what they were, too.
You'd stoop to anything.
- Yes?
- Yes.
Land of love!
Come on, Loxi.
I'll row you home before I call on Mr. Cutler.
Yes, sir, these sponges is wonderful.
Pleasant dreams, my friend.
You've had a busy day.
I'll just take these. They might blow away.
Oh, Loxi.
I don't know what happened.
I had to swim most a mile.
You cuttle-headed fool.
Why didn't you drown?
Them two swabs is horn-fisted, Mr. Cutler.
- Jack Stuart just hove in.
- Stuart?
Out of sight, Widgeon.
Where's Widgeon?
Who? That gooseneck who was your mate on the Jubilee.
That water didn't rain in here.
State your business, Capt. Stuart.
I was aboard that sponge boat tonight... when Widgeon brought your men on that crimping job.
My men?
That's all the proof the government needs on who sunk the Jubilee.
Well?
No more 50°% salvage, Mr. Cutler... but a room in a penitentiary where you and your hatchet men... can be cosy as fiddler crabs on a marsh bank.
You haven't got enough sand in your craw to stand in front of me alone.
Clear the room.
You ain't gonna fight him alone, are you, King?
I said, get out.
They'll find you on a marsh bank someday.
I didn't think you had it in you.
I've been looking a long time for a man who's exactly your size of fool.
You'll need some more fools.
Five of your bullyboys have shipped aboard a whaler for three years in Tolliver's place.
He sold them?
Well, what do you know.
He's got brains, that fellow.
Some of them are loose in his head right now.
What's the matter?
Don't you like your new boss?
Boss?
Tolliver won't boss the Devereaux line.
I've got command of the Southern Cross right here in my pocket.
Yes? I've got something here that says different.
A sloop's just put in with dispatches from Charleston.
- I pulled this one off the bulletin board.
- I'm not here to chew blubber.
So long as Commodore Devereaux's house flag is on the sea, I'll answer to him.
Then you'll answer to the grave.
Commodore Devereaux is dead.
Pour yourself a drink.
- You're lying.
- Read it yourself.
Steve Tolliver's the new head of Devereaux and Company.
Tolliver's the man you're sailing for, if you ever sail again.
But you won't.
You stood on your last quarterdeck.
But you know that better than I.
Tolliver won't let even a lobster crate take you aboard.
I tried to get rid of him for you.
I'd have had him three years on a hell ship, lost and forgotten.
But you made a fine picture of yourself tonight.
Fought like 10 men, didn't you?
Smashed up the toughest men I could send, didn't you?
Saved your fancy friend so he could be your boss. And what for?
So you could pound your brains out on a rum keg on the beach.
What did you come here for?
To smash up the only friend you've got.
And that Claiborne girl.
She'll stick with you on the beach.
You'll sleep on the beach and scratch for food... but she'll sew your filthy rags together, if you ask her to.
Only, you won't ask her to.
You're slow in the head, but you're more of a man than that.
Steve Tolliver will marry her after a while.
She'll be raising his kids while you're...
Shut up about her!
Or I'll tear that jaw out of your face.
You don't have to lie down, you know.
They need 10,000 blacks in the Mississippi basin.
Biack men bring a dollar a pound.
I'll put you back on the quarterdeck of a ship.
You take her to the Gold Coast, load her with black ivory.
In two years, you'll own your own ship.
In 10, you'll own a fleet.
Your own house flag on seven seas.
- Too slow.
- Slow, with the job I'm offering you?
The devil with that job.
I've got a job for you.
Do you know what cargo the Southern Cross carries?
Teak, ivory, spices, silks, indigo.
- Why?
- I'll show you how to get rich in one night.
Get your wreckers out to meet me at Satan Shoal.
I'm gonna pile up the Southern Cross.
Now you've caught the wind. $500,000.
But listen to me.
Tolliver won't leave you in command of the Southern Cross for 10 minutes... when he hears of this.
My schooner will take you to Havana tonight.
And I've got just the mate you need.
Widgeon, come out here.
Yes, Mr. Cutler.
Hiya, Capt. Stuart.
But I'll be back.
I'll be back on the very first ship.
- I'll go with you and make sure.
- No, Dan, you mustn't.
I can manage Mother much better alone.
If they try to keep you in Havana,
I'll bust that town...
I'm coming back to you, Dan.
Cross my heart, I will.
I don't care what Loxi says, and I don't care what anybody thinks.
I'm coming back. On the very first ship.
Two hundred ceroons of Bengal indigo at $1.25, down 10.
Twelve-hundred-and-fifty pieces
Nanking silk... at $3.98 the pound...
Look at that board now.
Raw silk has gone to blue blazes.
...at $4.40, down seven.
- And there goes ivory, down another seven.
Looks like the first call for panic.
Teak, silk, ivory, indigo.
A wreck always sends prices down of whatever cargo she's carrying.
Right. Except there's been no wreck.
That's the cargo of the Southern Cross.
Southern Cross can't have wrecked.
She's safe in Havana.
Then somebody knows she will wreck.
- And she sails before dawn.
- Yes.
Capt. Stuart in command.
- What's the fastest vessel in port?
- Claiborne.
- Then get your crew aboard.
- You're forgetting who owns her.
- Loxi won't charter to you.
- Then commandeer.
I've got to stop the Southern Cross in Havana.
Come morning, we'll have such a fog as a man can't cut with a crosscut saw.
We'll need a new door on the lazaret.
- How far have we come?
- We left Sand Key about 4 miles astern.
We come about 15 miles.
Let her out.
Let her out, he says.
Let her out, Jake!
And run for your life!
LOXl: Get out of my way!
- How dare you let him steal my schooner!
- Now, Loxi...
Stand by to come about! Hard alee!
Bring her up.
- Hard alee it is.
- Get forward. I'll take over.
Aye, sir.
This is piracy, kidnapping.
Stand away from that wheel.
Loxi, when we found you aboard,
I begged you to go ashore.
I wouldn't go ashore because I knew what he was about.
You've done everything you could to down Jack Stuart.
- I'm acting under federal authority.
- Racing to Havana to break him?
You believe in Jack above all things on Earth, don't you?
- I'll always believe in him.
- Come here, Loxi.
- I'll never forgive you for helping.
- Honey, you got to know the truth.
Jack made a deal with Cutler.
He's gonna wreck the Southern Cross.
- Capt. Phil, have you been drinking?
- We'll put that to one side.
I'd rather be drowned dead than hurt you.
- Did Jack tell you that himself?
- No, he didn't.
I wouldn't believe it even if he had.
- Steve, won't you put back?
- No.
I'm sorry I'm the one to do this to you, but it doesn't matter what you believe.
Jack Stuart will not sail in command of the Southern Cross.
But that's ruin. Don't smash his life just because your pride is hurt.
How will he get another command?
He'll never command even a mud scow in this world or the next, once I reach Havana.
Then you'll never reach Havana.
LOXl: Come about or I'll part the halyards.
No, Loxi, you'll wreck her!
You crazy little wildcat!
LOXl: Will you put back?
Not while she floats.
The gaff jaws are smashed.
Get a lashing on this sail!
I reckon you won't stop the Southern Cross from my ship, Mr. Tolliver.
Get a line on this gaff.
No, Loxi, you'll jibe her!
Don't part that line.
What's the damage?
We'll drift for six or seven hours while we jury-rig and re-bend.
Six or seven hours?
Down with your jibs and staysail.
If the Southern Cross goes down...
The Southern Cross isn't going down,
Capt. Stuart's in command.
Sam, lay on those downhauls.
Case 52, Nanking silk.
Claim that starboard side.
Widgeon, stow the rest of that oil in the orlop.
Aye, sir.
I told you, Drusilla, we carry no passengers.
Please, Jack, you've just got to take me.
It's like life and death to me.
I can't take you. Believe me.
Now, you go on back to your mother and stop begging.
When you get that stuff stowed, batten down.
Jack, listen to me, please.
Jack, you ought to understand and help me... because you love Loxi... and she wants to be with you, just like I want to be with Dan.
Please, Jack, I...
I'm running away from home to marry him.
Will you go ashore or do I put you off?
All ashore. Get going.
Batten down here.
Aye, sir.
She's all singled up, sir.
Stand by, forward.
Aye, aye, sir.
Planks off.
Heim amidships.
Hold fast, aft! Let go of your forward line!
Slow astern.
- No bottom, sir.
- We missed it by a split hair.
I wasn't gonna say nothing, but we might nigh have drifted on Satan Shoal.
That's the worst pack of reefs around here anywhere.
- Should have anchored hours ago.
- Yes, in 400 fathom.
That horn's driving me crazy.
Nearer all the time, but never gets here!
LOXl: Hour after hour!
One hour.
I never heard a horn like that.
Sounds like something out of the bottom of the sea.
Probably a hand-pumped horn worked by a crank.
Yes. Pumping his own wind, too, likely.
I know it's steam!
Well, suppose it is the Southern Cross.
Jack knows what he's doing.
He can pick a channel.
LOXl: But it isn't. It's the Saturn, or some other paddle coaster.
I suppose you know whose conch that is?
That's Cutler's Falcon.
Yes. You don't need to smell the bait to know somebody's going fishing.
The steamer's safe. She's got power!
Wind or no wind, she's not drifting around helpless like a cracker box, like us.
No bottom, sir.
Go on, say it.
We'd be in Havana except for what I did.
I'm glad I did it and I'd do it again!
- Because with all my heart I believe in him.
- Yeah.
Hark, ye.
Hark, ye!
- Can you see her?
- You'll be seeing her soon enough.
Sound your sea horn, Sam!
Any minute now.
More steam.
Aye, sir.
Drive her.
That'll be the Falcon's signal.
- Sounded to me like...
- Heave the lead!
Heave it is, sir.
More steam you want?
She's shaking her caulks out now.
- You, Salt Meat.
- Yeah?
Check the forward well, she must be making water.
Jughead, get over there!
There she rises. Laying straight for the reef.
The Southern Cross.
LOXl: No. It can't be.
Oh, Steve.
Give me that horn, Sam.
It's going astride.
Jack! Hard astern, Jack!
The reef! You're going to strike!
Pretty work. She's plastered on the reef like a herring on a biscuit.
Man the lifeboats!
Aye, aye, sir.
She's down by the head.
- She's a killed ship.
- Yeah.
There ain't nothing left but to get her people off.
There's one thing left.
Arrest the man who murdered his own command.
Stand by your boat tackle!
Aye, aye, Capt. Phil.
Look after her.
Lower away!
Aye, aye, sir.
Capt. Phil, why didn't he kill me instead?
And the night before you took command of the Southern Cross... did you or did you not talk to King Cutler... this same man who is now conducting your defence?
Objection, Your Honour.
Mr. Cutler is defending Capt. Stuart, not himself.
Your Honour, before this case is finished...
I propose to throw the shadow of the gallows... over many in this room.
The witness may answer.
Sure, I talked to King Cutler. So have you.
Capt. Stuart, there are other able skippers with ships in Rotten Row... but you were the first to stand in defence of the pirate wreckers that haunt these Keys.
I don't ask what unendurabie circumstance drove you... to join these men whom you must despise.
But i will ask the court for lenlency in your behalf... if you will join with me in the destruction of these rats.
Tell us who was behind the wrecking of the Southern Cross.
I'm not hiding behind anybody, Tolliver.
If you're trying to hang Cutler, hang him for some other wreck.
Nobody gave any orders on the Southern Cross but me.
You admit giving the order that drove that ship at top speed... through thick fog to sure destruction?
I was her skipper.
And who was your first mate?
Matthias Widgeon.
The same man who was first mate of the wrecked Jubiiee?
Yes.
Your witness, Mr. Cutler.
No questions.
That's all.
Call Capt. Phillip Philpott.
Capt. Philpott, please.
Adinarin, how did you finally get home last night?
You go back to the house and look after Mother. Tell her I'm all right.
Just when they're a-getting heated up.
You were an eyewitness to the wreck of the Southern Cross?
How would you judge her speed?
Why, she come thrashing through the fog there, fit to bust her ballast.
- How long have you known Capt. Stuart?
- Ever since Cutler wrecked the Jubilee.
I object to this scandalous attack!
Strike out the answer.
In your opinion, could that wreck have been anything but deliberate?
Object!
Sustain.
- It was a typical King Cutler job.
- I said sustain!
I heard you, Will. Jehoshaphat.
I'm only answering the man's questions.
Silence!
Your witness.
No questions.
No questions?
Man gets up here for nothing.
I ask you to remember that a man is on trial here... for the gravest offence known to the sea.
Except that no loss of life is shown...
this man, if guilty, might well hang.
Proceed.
I thank Your Honour.
We admit the defendant's error... but you cannot convict a captain for bad seamanship.
Your Honour... we will show that behind the bad seamanship lay a criminal conspiracy.
And will you also show why you were waiting beside the reef...
when the Southern Cross went down?
Your Honour, if this man is to go on as prosecutor... the strange part which he himself has played in this disaster cannot be ignored.
Why were you waiting beside the reef that sank the Southern Cross?
It's in the testimony that Mr. Tolliver's vessel fell becalmed.
Becalmed when the wind held till dawn?
He tells us he sailed all night, yet he was only 15 miles on his course.
Why? He dares not answer.
Because the only living man who could have foretold that wreck... is the man who planned it!
Capt. Phil.
Gentlemen.
There are a thousand ways by which conniving men may profit... by the wrecking of their own ships.
And there stands a Charleston sea lawyer who knows them all.
He swindled his underwriters!
He swindled you... as he lay at Satan Shoal to gut the cargo of a ship... he himself had wrecked!
- That cargo ain't been touched.
- Only because no diver will go down.
That ship hangs on the reef by a hair.
Your Honour, I demand an answer.
Why was Stephen Tolliver at that reef?
Mr. Tolliver, will you answer?
I will not.
Of course he won't answer.
He can't.
If you please, Judge Marvin.
I can tell you why Mr. Tolliver won't answer that question.
Miss Claiborne cannot testify unless she is called.
Mr. Tolliver, do you wish Miss Claiborne sworn as your witness?
I do not.
But he's charging Steve with something he didn't do.
Your Honour, there is nothing to be gained by calling her.
I call Miss Claiborne as a witness for the court.
The reason the Claiborne didn't reach
Havana was that I disabled her.
You disabled her?
I parted the main beak halyards with a wrecking axe.
Why?
Because I had faith in Jack Stuart.
Didn't Mr. Tolliver tell you that he believed
Stuart would wreck the Southern Cross?
Yes, sir, he did.
Miss Claiborne had every reason not to believe me.
This is incredible.
Have you any questions, Mr. Tolliver?
None.
I certainly have.
So, Miss Claiborne, you disabled this vessel?
Virtually knocked her apart with your own little hands... while a full crew of able seamen stood around sucking their teeth.
No, gentlemen.
What you have heard is a girl caught hopelessly between two men... who have fought over her as dogs fight over a bone.
I object to this...
Sustained.
Didn't you play these men one against the other... encouraging each in turn?
Isn't that why they're both hopelessly entangled in this disaster?
I won't answer that.
Isn't that why you're now trying to undo what you've done... by taking some part of Stephen Tolliver's guilt to yourself?
Judge Marvin, we're not here to crucify this woman who's not even on trial.
No, we're here to learn the facts, and they're deadly plain.
Now we can understand this vicious persecution of a man... whose only crime is that he stands between Tolliver and that girl.
Your Honour, when this case is over... the court may bring me to trial on Mr. Cutler's charges if it so desires.
But the government's case against Jack Stuart is not over.
For years we've tried to find one witness who wouid turn against this pirate ring.
That witness has been found.
I ask the court's leave to call a man who, to save his own neck from the halter... has made full confession.
Matthias Widgeon.
Granted. Step down, Miss Claiborne.
- Did Widgeon talk?
- Yes.
He talked.
Call Matthias Widgeon, mate of the Southern Cross.
Call Matthias Widgeon.
Widgeon!
Come on...
Sheriff! Widgeon is dead!
Sheriff, Widgeon is dead!
Doctor, in your opinion...
- how long has Widgeon been dead?
- Less than half an hour, Your Honour.
Maybe good riddance.
Your Honour, this case must be recessed for full investigation.
I can hardly recess in lieu of a witness who can never appear.
- But if federal council wishes to withdraw...
- Withdraw?
But, Your Honour,
America's very life depends upon the sea.
This case goes far beyond the fate of one man... who betrayed his own command.
We must know whether any group of men can endanger the safety of our seas... by preying upon American commerce.
The government's witness has been murdered... but we elect to proceed.
Just a minute.
I agree that he was murdered, silenced for what he knew.
I charge that Widgeon drove that ship on the reef in direct conspiracy with you.
- You're off your course, Cutler.
- I told you he was a bad Yankee.
You can sustain that, too, Will, if you've a mind to.
Certainly this poor, honest seaman had no knowledge of it.
Why did he order his stokers driven under the whip?
- That has not been shown.
- I'll show it now.
Call Salt Meat.
Your name is Salt Meat?
Aye, aye, sir.
And you're a Barbados freeman who served as stoker...
- aboard the Southern Cross?
- Aye, aye, sir.
You know Capt. Stuart's voice, don't you?
I reckon I do.
- Didn't you hear him order full speed?
- Why...
Objection.
Sustained.
You were in the stokehold at the time of the wreck, were you not?
No, sir. I was in the orlop.
You were in the orlop?
Yes, sir. That's where I was... when the steamer, she smashed against that reef... and I heard that dying scream.
You heard what?
When the reef tore out the heart of that ship... she screamed like a woman.
You mean you heard tearing timbers, escaping steam.
Twenty years I know the sea... like I knows day from dark.
But I never heard no sound like that, except when a woman die.
Was there a woman aboard?
No, sir.
I think she go ashore before we sail.
- Who?
- The lady what talked to the Captain.
A lady?
You know who she was?
No, sir.
What did she look like?
I don't rightly recomember how she was dressed... but she was wrapped in a mighty pretty shawl.
- What kind of a shawl?
- What colour?
What kind of a shawl?
I don't know, but it was mighty pretty.
Kind of red and yellow.
Your Honour, I request permission to interrupt this testimony...
- and recall Jack Stuart to the stand.
- Granted.
- That's all, Salt Meat.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Your Honour, this ghost story has no bearing on the case.
No woman was rescued from that ship.
If one was aboard, murder must be added to the charge of wrecking.
- Did the Southern Cross carry passengers?
- No.
But a woman came aboard just before you cast off.
- What of it? She didn't sail.
- You sure of that?
Who saw her leave? Did you?
I ordered her ashore.
- She might've stowed away.
- She wouldn't have stowed away.
Then you knew her!
Yes. I knew her.
Jack. Was it Drusilla?
Yes. It was Drusilla.
Drusilla Alston?
Yes.
Who screamed?
- Who screamed?
- Keep your head, Dan.
Dan, keep out of this!
If that scream was Drusilla,
I'll tear the throat out of you.
- She wasn't onboard.
- You're lying. You didn't see her leave.
Dan, shut up!
Order in this court!
I call Dan Cutler to the stand.
I object to the questioning of a man who's out of his mind with grief and fear.
Overruled.
Dan Cutler, take the stand.
- You loved Drusilla Alston, didn't you?
- Yes.
- She loved you?
- Yes.
And you were going to be married?
Yes.
She promised to come back to you soon from Havana. Didn't she?
- Yes.
- On what ship?
The first one she could get.
And that happened to be the Southern Cross.
I knew Drusilla, Dan.
A sweet and lovely young girl.
She begged you 100 times to give up the rotten business... you and your brother are in.
Objection.
Sustained.
We heard the Falcon's call through the fog.
Your boat, Dan...
waiting like a bird of prey for the Southern Cross... which you knew would strike. Didn't you?
Don't answer that.
But you did not know that your sweetheart was aboard that doomed ship.
Did you?
Don't answer.
The Lord moves in a mysterious way, Dan.
You didn't hear that scream, but it'll ring in your brain through all eternity.
- I don't believe she's down there.
- We don't know, Dan.
But some woman is down there... under 10 fathoms of green water... all alone in a dead ship... where the shark and the giant squid swim through the dark shadows.
It wasn't the ship that screamed, Dan.
It was a woman.
Maybe Drusilla.
- And you know the men who...
- Don't answer.
Your Honour, this...
They'd like to silence you the way they silenced Widgeon.
It isn't me they're afraid of, Dan. It's you... because you know who is guilty.
If Drusilla's under that sea...
I'll send the men who put her there straight to hell.
Even your own brother?
Even my own brother.
All day we've heard the prosecution present a mass of lying insinuations... based on evidence which cannot be shown.
Now i challenge Mr. Tolliver to produce this evidence.
I challenge Mr. Tolliver himself to dive to that sunken hull... to bring up the proof he claims is there.
Mr. Cutler, such a dive is impossible.
If murder has been done, this court must know it.
I will undertake to find an experienced diver... to show Mr. Tolliver the way.
I cannot order men to almost certain death.
You don't have to.
That dive is not impossible. I'll make it.
Mr. Tolliver would be a madman to accept.
Perhaps, Your Honour, but I have no choice.
I move that this court be adjourned to the wreck of the Southern Cross.
- Consarn it! You lost your reason?
- Judge Marvin, you can't let them.
This court stands adjourned to the wreck of the Southern Cross.
Stars alive. You men calculating to take all day with that rig?
I don't know,
I can't get no air through the hose.
- Try taking your foot off it. Might help some.
- Maybe so.
- How soon you reckon that squall will hit?
- Too soon.
Capt. Stuart, the court warns you that what you may find down there... may well cost you your life.
Thanks.
If that girl is down there... come back alone.
That far down, light won't be much.
If she's there, you'll see that red and yellow shawl.
That fool brother of mine will hang us all.
Does that tell you what to do down there?
Lubbock knows his business.
If the girl is there, signal with your lifeline.
Two, one, two, one.
Tolliver's air hose will break at the pump.
Ready to lower away.
Jack, I'm afraid.
Here, take my southwester.
When the squall strikes, it'll take the curl out of your hair.
Whatever's down there, Jack... don't add another crime to what we've done already.
I'll bring you a rainbow fish for breakfast.
Come on with that helmet.
- Better keep one eye on that pump, man.
- Yes, and the other one on Cutler.
I see. I thought so.
Good luck, Steve. Try and forgive me.
Forgive you? Loxi, I...
If I should happen to be late for supper, just see that Romulus doesn't overeat.
There's a squall coming up.
It won't give you many minutes.
Yes, and Romulus doesn't like fish much, either.
Steve.
Bolt the faceplate home.
The wreck moved!
It dropped another fathom!
- Are they coming up?
- No. He's signalling for more line.
He's starting to signal.
Hold him down, Sam!
He never finished the signal.
Tie him up!
Help!
Both lifelines are fouled! Yield slack!
Look!
Pay out!
There's ink coming up from the hatches!
- That there's from a giant squid.
- Squid? Where?
Hold fast, men!
- Get them up!
- It's a marejada!
A marejada!
LOXl: Get the men up! Get them up!
Cast off that hawser!
Cut that hawser!
All hands to the lifeline!
Keep them pumps working!
A lifeline has carried away.
- One of them is lost with the wreck!
- One's coming up.
Who is it? Which one?
Can't tell yet.
Steady on them air pumps there.
Keep them going.
I can see a body. Heave ho!
Easy now. Don't smash him up against the hull.
I can see the steel helmet.
That's Tolliver.
Keep that hose clear!
LOXl: Steve.
They got Tolliver.
Keep his head upright!
All hands, haul him in!
Lift him over now.
Control his feet.
Careful, now. Set him down.
Faceplate ain't broke, is it?
No.
Steady does it, now.
Rub the back of his neck, Dave.
Take off that belt, Sam.
Is he badly hurt?
Looks like that squid tore him up a bit.
- Where's...
- Now you just take it easy, son.
We're all right glad to see you.
Just wait till you get your wind before you tell us what happened.
- Where's Jack Stuart? Did you get him up?
- No, his lifeline parted.
He could've got away.
He stayed down to save my life.
It cost him his own.
He went down with his ship.
Steve, did you find...
Was Drusilla...
That's the answer, all right.
Look at it, King.
- You did this.
- Shut up, you fool.
That wreck was yours. You planned it.
You put her on the rocks the same as you did 100 others!
Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.
I'll shut up when I see you hung, and not before.
You won't see it.
He shot him!
Look out, King!
Look out! He's shooting again!
He's done for.
Yeah. Serves him right.
I sworn, that's the first time
I ever known that thing could shoot.
This is all my doing.
Tell Drusilla...
I have a pretty shawl for her.
Drusilla loved him so.
What's the matter, dog? Is you busted?
No, ma'am. I'm just shy.
They seem to be having a little trouble getting acquainted.
So did we.
Yes.
This Alfonso d'Este, do they say how big he is?
Yes. They say he's over six feet tall.
A giant of a man.
A respectful silence is the least you can offer your dead husband.
Would you say the dead man made a reluctant corpse?
A loose tongue soon loses its mouth, Captain Orsini.
A wise tongue never needs to repeat itself, Don Esteban... nor does a competent assassin.
Duke Cesare.
We have suffered a most tragic loss.
My dear sister Lucrezia's broken with grief.
The court will observe a proper period of mourning.
- How long, de Lorqua?
- One year, my lord Cesare.
One month.
The dead must not place too great a burden on the living.
It's my belief that everything, even death, can be turned into profit.
Our armies hold Pesaro,
Rimini, Forlì.
We're on the road to Urbino, Bologna, Siena.
All Tuscany, the center of Italy from coast to coast will be ours.
Then inevitably, Milan... and Venice.
But this devil-begotten Ferrara stands blocking our progress.
You, Gravina, you're the military genius.
- How would you take it?
- Perhaps with 10,000 troops.
Or a woman.
We will walk into Ferrara through a bedroom.
By arranging a marriage between my recently widowed sister Lucrezia... and, uh, Alfonso, the servant of Duke d'Este.
Your Lordship knows that Duke d'Este is negotiating such a marriage with the French king.
Alfonso's a blacksmith.
He needs a lusty woman... not one of those frail, French birds.
And who will convey this delicate information?
Who?
Who but a man as quick at deceit as a fox.
He must have the grace of a dancer, the wrist of an assassin.
He must have little regard for good faith.
Yet by his astuteness, be able to confuse men's minds.
He must have confidence
in himself.'...
yet not permit that confidence
to render him incautious.
He must charm as a snake charms a bird... yet he must make no friends... except those that can be of use to him.
And for the same reason, although we make use of love...
he must not love.
You may go now, all of you, except...
Andrea Orsini.
You question me?
Then go!
You're pleased with my choice?
I have never questioned
Your Lordship's judgment.
- Don Esteban was annoyed.
- Don Esteban is easily annoyed.
Don't underestimate him, Andrea.
Remember, that in this race for glory... he's always just behind you ready to pass you if you should lose a single step.
I have learned that if my wits are quick, my feet will be quick enough.
You've learned something else today?
Why your sister's husband was sent to another world.
One life is little enough to pay for all Ferrara.
So long as it's not mine.
Drink.
You are a complete rogue.
I need someone that can follow my mind... who can keep his eyes fixed on the ultimate goal— one Italy... one kingdom, one king—
Cesare Borgia.
Think of it— chief minister to a great new kingdom.
What prize on earth could equal it?
But the great know only one law— the outcome justifies the act.
Have you the stomach for greatness?
The stomach and the appetite.
Then bring me Alfonso d'Este's promise to marry Lucrezia... and I'll be certain of it.
Your Lordship will find me a most efficient Cupid.
Try some of your shafts on my cousin, Angela.
She's waiting for you.
No.
That way.
De Lorqua.
Captain Orsini leaves tomorrow for Ferrara.
He travels by way of Venice.
Arrange the necessary passage.
Yes, Duke Cesare.
Angela.
Oh, Angela, my love. I've been commissioned to leave immediately for Ferrara.
Yes, I know.
It will take you away from me, and yet you are pleased.
Only because the reward is great.
Oh, I love you.
I love you, Andrea.
But I don't trust you.
You're too ambitious.
If I'm ambitious, it's only to make myself worthy of your love.
For without your love,
I'm nothing.
What do you think of that?
Good. Very good.
It's not signed.
Did you paint it?
Would it be any better if it were signed Leonardo da Vinci?
- It would be worth more.
- Never mind.
It's not for sale.
I need it in my business.
But... what do you think of this?
Ah. A gem!
A rare gem!
- It's not signed either.
- It doesn't need to be.
Will you sell it?
I might.
I will, uh, risk, uh, 50 ducats.
I risked my life.
- Let Cesare Borgia pay for that.
- He does, in opportunities.
How I die is his problem.
How I live is my own.
- Uh, 60.
- I'm a poor man on an expensive mission.
Seventy-five, and that's my last offer.
My lowest price is 100 ducats, and only out of love for you.
- Ninety.
- It's worth more than that to me.
I'll buy your painting.
Madonna Camilla.
What an honor!
What a delight. Your Signora drops like an ángel from heaven.
To find you bargaining like a fishwife.
Not for myself, but for a client.
Oh, then it's worth the price?
No doubt, if beauty has a price.
Will you let me have this for 100 ducats?
Please?
Accept it as a tribute to your own beauty.
You mean that you'll give me this beautiful thing?
If Your Highness would honor me.
Well, did you hear that?
And he doesn't even know me.
You have greatness of soul, Messer.
I will hang it in a place of honor in my own bedroom... where it will always recall your generosity to me and to my good husband.
Well, Messer, have you nothing appropriate to say?
Forgive my silence.
I— I was just thinking... with envy and admiration of your husband.
I was also deploring the fact that while
Your Highness has a memento of our meeting...
I have nothing.
You're not hinting for a gift in return?
"Hinting" is hardly the word for it.
But I—
There.
I will keep this as a saint's relic... in memory of the divine hand that wore it.
Master da Pavia, isn't it time you presented this gentleman?
Magnifico Andrea Orsini, captain to His Excellency, Duke Cesare Borgia.
Oh, then I know your kinsman.
- The cardinal, the duke of Gravina.
- Distant kinsman.
My family is of Naples.
My great uncle was Raimondo Orsini, count of Nola.
Oh, indeed. Now, will you please present me?
I have the honor to present
Camilla degli Baglioni... wife of His Excellency,
Marc Antonio Verano...
Iord of Città del Monte.
Who is very pleased to have exchanged souvenirs with you.
Would you do my husband and me the honor of waiting on us?
Well, unfortunately,
I leave for Ferrara.
You go alone?
Armed with an olive branch.
- A pleasant journey, Messer Orsini.
- Madame. Messer.
How long have you known this gentleman?
Oh, three years about.
What do you make of him?
A soldier who knows art... an Orsini unrelated to the Orsini... a servant of the Borgias going alone to Borgia's enemies.
He has too many faces.
I find him interesting.
I hope you may not find him dangerous,
Madonna. He drives a hard bargain.
Grazie.
- Don't be a fool! Don't be a fool!
- Fool to kill you?
If you kill me, you'll never know why I attacked you.
Get up.
On your feet.
Walk in front of me toward the light.
Ah, a face like yours shouldn't be hidden in the dark.
- It's beautiful.
- It's been called everything but that.
Oh, only by the unartistic.
Oh, there's— there's design in your face.
A hundred twisted
curves and angles... tortured into a pattern of exquisite evil.
And you have beautiful and artistic hands.
That face, those hands, your voice and manner of speaking.
You are, of course, of gentle birth.
What does my birth got to do with you?
I like to know something about the people I deal with.
Why rake over the past of a hired assassin?
Because it may determine our future.
Now tell me, who employed you to assassinate me?
- I never sell my wares until I know the price.
- How much is your life worth?
- Why?
- 'Cause that's all I promise to pay.
Now you're unarmed and I'm not squeamish.
Besides, you deserve to die.
Well, I'm, uh— I'm waiting for a fresh topic of conversation.
Did I hear you say Duke d'Este paid you to draw my blood?
- In advance.
- How much?
- You were expensive.
- They paid without bargaining?
Yes. You're distinctly not wanted in Ferrara.
Do you know why?
I never cut a throat without knowing whose it is or why I'm cutting it.
The mere idea of a marriage between
Alfonso d'Este and Lucrezia Borgia... blisters their pride.
The lady's had too public a life.
Well, having lost you one employment,
I should find you another.
Your game?
It amuses me to think of entering Ferrara... the master of the man who was hired to kill me.
Such insolence is stimulating. But have you thought of what will happen to me?
The same thing that'll happen to me.
We live or die together. And I intend to live.
I'll bear your service while the bond lasts, and warn you when I'm quitting.
Fair enough.
Let's to bed. We leave in the early morning for Ferrara.
There's a fine inn at Crespino with a beautiful kitchen.
Would Your Lordship wish to spend the night there?
No. That's a prosperous looking farm.
Why shouldn't it be?
That's the widow Zoppo's farm.
Why do you turn down
your nose at it?
Ah, to answer that
would be really a story.
There was the father,
a blacksmith... and his good wife,
Mona Maria.
They had a son who was more than bright.
So, the poor, foolish parents saved their money... to send him to Padua to study with the great masters.
Some six years ago, he disappeared.
The next we heard, he had become a bandit down south in the Regno.
- The father's dead, huh?
- Yes, almost two years.
They say from a broken heart.
The old lady lives alone?
Yes, and keeps her thoughts to herself.
Only the old woman and God know how much gold she has hid away.
Every ducat of it stolen
by her bandit son.
Where does she hide her gold?
Who knows where an old woman hides her gold?
In pots buried in the earth... in sugar bowls, under her bed, in her skirts.
Women can find always places to confound a man.
They spend their lives
confounding us.
We'll stop tonight at Crespino.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Who is it?
What do you want?
Keep out of my house!
- Andrea.
- Oh, Mammina.
My boy!
My boy, my boy, my boy.
Thank God you've come home to me.
Let me look at you.
Let me—
My goodness, just like a gentleman... with a sword... and real fur on his collar and a red hat.
So beautiful.
No, you're the one who's beautiful.
You haven't changed a bit.
No, thanks to you.
For six years
I worry and wait and wait.
Mammina, you're not going to waste our precious time scolding me.
- How soon must you go?
- Sunrise.
Oh, Furio. Stop it!
- Someone outside?
- Oh, no. Rabbits, mice, cats.
A widow's dog never rests.
- I know, Mammina.
- He had great hopes for you.
If only he could have waited.
I do well now, I assure you.
Quiet, Furio! Stop it.
Come, sit down.
Do all painters wear swords and red hats?
I live by a different art now.
Yes. People call me
the mother of a bandit.
Perhaps they're right.
But at least no common bandit. I work for one who dreams of stealing all Italy.
His name is Cesare Borgia.
You devil.
Why didn't you tell me that before?
Because you would have taken the money
I sent you and come to Rome to see me.
- Are you ashamed of your mother?
- No, but you'd never have found me.
- Why not?
- Well, I have another name now.
Why?
Names are important, Mammina, to open certain doors.
The one I took belongs to the dead branch of a famous family.
What name?
I can't tell you that yet.
But it's brought me good luck.
I am at home in many great palaces.
There's a title in the offing... a great marriage, the founding of a princely house.
What do you say to that?
When you, my son, Andrea Zoppo, painted this Madonna... you were depending on yourself and the light God gave you.
Now, to be a grand signore, you depend on sham and trickery.
Oh, Mammina, you don't understand.
Times have changed.
A new world is being born.
Sham and trickery are only weapons of policy.
We live or die, succeed or fail, by only one law:
The end justifies the means.
- Holy Mother of God, forgive him this blasphemy.
- Mammina—
Stop him from following this sinful path, even if you must wither his legs—
- Mammina.
- Or blind his eyes.
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Stop him even if you must—
Stop that idiotic nonsense, or I swear I'll never come here again.
Nor do I want you to come back... unless it be as my true son,
Andrea Zoppo.
And I suppose you'll reject the money I send you too.
I don't want your money.
Forgive my son, Blessed Mother.
Note the reinforcing of the breach.
My lord father, I have offset the softness of the bronze.
Your Grace.
One Messer Mario Belli requests an audience with Your Lordship.
Bring him here.
Dismiss these men.
Return to the foundry. Go.
Go on back, all of you.
And you, Roberto.
This is a rare assassin.
You bring me news?
Come closer.
Who is the man you bring with you?
It, uh—
It's a long story, my lord.
Then as to your mission, answer a simple yes or no.
I have the honor to present to Your Excellencies...
the lord Andrea Orsini.
I am honored to be in the presence of Your Excell—
Guards, arrest this man!
You—You will hang by the heels for this!
I beg Your Lordship not to be offended by Messer Belli's regrettable failure.
- You are impudent, sir!
- Shall we say "tolerant"?
You will not live to return to your master.
One must be practical about these things, Your Grace.
My lord Cesare's forces,
600 lancers, 10,000 foot...
are even now within striking distance
of your peaceful duchy.
This is hardly the time for one to murder his emissary... even if he had thought it necessary to send one... for other than the most affectionate of reasons.
My lord father, this Messer Orsini has a rare spirit.
Then you enjoy it!
You are not welcome here,
Messer Orsini.
I advise you to leave as quickly as possible.
Guards, back to your posts.
- As for you—
- Messer Belli comes with me... and is also under the protection of Cesare Borgia.
Do not try my patience too far.
It's always best to do as my lord father commands.
I beg a moment, my lord.
- I have long looked forward to this meeting.
- Why?
As a soldier to bow before Your Lordship's genius.
Your Grace is a man of fame.
The whole world waits with anxious wonder for your next invention.
From highest castle to humblest hut, the question is ever the same:
What new type of cannon will the genius Alfonso d'Este next devise?
Why? Because upon cannon
depends the future of war.
And upon war depends
the future ofhistory.
Who then can deny that history may well nominate Alfonso d'Este...
as the greatest man ofhis age?
You're a man of intelligence.
I'll show you something that'll make your blood run cold.
Then I'll show you something that'll make yours run hot.
Who builds this first may well own the world.
Each of those tubes, a gun.
In each gun, a shot.
All to be sent against the enemy in rapid fire.
It is absolutely irresistible.
One hundred thousand ducats,
and that's not all.
There's steel as well as gold in this dowry— the lances of Duke Cesare— enough to protect the rights of Ferrara against any state.
But the supreme dowry is herself.
Her beauty and the love she bears Your Excellence.
What love?
She's only seen me once... and then she was little more than an infant.
Childhood impressions are the most lasting... especially when they are fed to maturity by constant curiosity.
You are her first and only love.
I, um— I risk my life when I tell you this.
But it was she who said to me one day, and I quote...
"It might very well be that Alfonso d'Este with his brilliant mind... fits the role of Italy's supreme ruler better than my brother Cesare."
One stroke of the pen, my lord... and you have brought glory to Ferrara and joy to your bed.
Two hundred thousand.
Amend the document and sign, my lord.
And I'll wager that your noble father is as unable to resist that heroic figure... as the beautiful Lucrezia is unable to resist yours.
I am very, very pleased with myself, Andrea.
I'm a man of extraordinarily fine judgment.
Shall I tell you how I know this?
Because I chose you to go to Ferrara.
And you did well— remarkably well.
I congratulate myself.
This new problem... it will be more profitable for you and more amusing.
What you win is yours, subject to my control, of course.
And it includes a rare jewel.
- My lord.
- My garden is filled with beautiful women... and you stand here like a brooding nemesis.
- I was thinking.
- Good. Practice makes perfect.
You should listen though.
You might learn something. Come along.
The obvious is always a deceitful temptation in the world of practical affairs.
For example, the obvious solution to the problems I am about to present to you... might be an assassin's blade... in the back of that gentle old man.
As a matter of fact, your good friend
Don Esteban has already suggested it.
- Then I question its wisdom.
- Oh, it has value... except that it's premature.
Now, there's thejewel.
Imagine all that beauty wasted on a husband old enough to be her grandfather.
- That one?
- Mm-hmm.
Spring in the lap of winter.
But you're the man to correct that.
However, you will have to climb high to get to her.
Their duchy is an eagle's nest sitting atop a mountain.
- Città del Monte.
- Is there anything about which you're uninformed?
- Your plans for Città del Monte.
- Very simple.
I want it by next spring.
Your Lordship plans to invade the Marches in the summer.
You see, Captain, what a quick mind he has?
Now, where do we start our conquest of Città del Monte, hmm?
The husband.
An old wall is more easily breached.
Our illustrious hostess designated the noble Messer Orsini... to be our guide and mentor while we're in Rome.
From what I know of the noble Messer Orsini... there should be no one more competent to guard us from evil than he.
You've met before, Madonna?
Have we, Messer Orsini?
An unfair question, Madonna.
I could play the gallant and answer...
"Yes, a thousand times, each time I've looked on beauty."
Or I could be cautious
and sly and say that...
"Madonna's memory will guide my answer."
You would not be easy to forget.
A man's ego demands that he be completely remembered if ever met.
Therefore, in self-defense,
I must assume...
Madonna means that we have never met.
There you have a perfect illustration of the language of diplomacy.
If somebody asked me now if these two have ever met... and I assure you,
I couldn't answer yes or no.
- Does it really matter, my lord husband?
- Of course not.
Begging Messer Orsini's pardon... one meets and forgets thousands of people in the course of a lifetime.
It is my pleasure as well as my duty... to make our association in Rome a memorable one.
We came to Rome for our souls' sake and in God's keeping... and we ask for no better protection.
Nevertheless, it is gratifying to know that we have Your Excellency's protection as well... if only against those who think themselves beyond God's will.
But there's been no link between us to create friendship and trust.
We must correct that.
We must exchange ambassadors.
- Well—
- It's the only solution.
I will appoint an ambassador before Your Lordship leaves Rome.
As a matter of fact, I appoint him now—
Messer Andrea Orsini...
one of the most amiable
of all my young men.
We shall welcome you to our court as a friend, Messer Orsini.
I am dedicated to Your Signore's service from this moment on.
The journey has been fatiguing.
May we have Your Lordship's permission to retire?
- The problem suits you?
- Uniquely.
It will not be easy, eh?
I will deliver to Your Magnificence
Città del Monte... and the loyalty of its people by spring.
To be taken by romantic conquest.
We Borgias are not sentimentalists.
First, Città del Monte, then your marriage.
With Madonna Camilla somewhere in between.
We'll worry about her when the time comes.
You promised we would be married on his return from Ferrara.
Marriage is a formality which can be accomplished at any time.
Problems of state come first.
- Is this agreeable to you?
- My lord commands. I obey.
I'll reason with her. Once you've made the old man's wife love you... it ought not to be too difficult for your ensign,
Belli, to make a widow of her.
I'm told he's quite a subtle rascal.
- Messer Andrea.
- Your Excellency.
Women are the gauge of a man's weakness.
You are an artist, Belli.
You have the touch of the courtier.
The breeding of a gentleman.
You were born for great enterprise.
- Why—
- Sit, my friend.
You—You overrate me a thousandfold, my lord.
Nor could you have allied yourself with a more promising patron... than Captain Orsini.
He's a brilliant young man.
But the flesh is proverbially weak.
Vicissitudes occur.
It's always well to take precautions.
Thus, if the noble
Orsini remains faithful to my service... you will continue to serve me by serving him.
But... if, God forbid, he should... waver... for any reason... you will continue to serve me.
There you are—
200 ducats.
Your Graciousness has made me wealthy beyond my most impossible dreams.
Hmm. Have no illusions about my generosity.
Knowledge is always a good investment.
I also know when
I have made a bad bargain.
Good night.
I would like to say a few words.
Captain Orsini comes to us as Cesare Borgia's ambassador.
That is good. Perhaps the duke will learn through his ambassador... that if we prosper, it is because we live in peace.
And that if we enjoy peace... it is because we want only friendship and understanding... of our neighbors and of each other.
I depend on you all to help Captain Orsini... to send this message to his illustrious master...
Captain the lord Orsini.
My lord Verano. Signori.
I am a professional soldier.
If you should see me climbing your walls, know that I am studying your defenses.
But know also that
I was not sent here for that.
My wise and illustrious master,
Duke Cesare... has already told me that your defenses are impregnable.
He has also told me that one citizen of Città del Monte... is worth 500 mercenaries.
In his wisdom, Duke Cesare has identified your strength... as loyalty.
I am here to spy on that loyalty... to learn for him the secret of how it works.
I am already learning.
Please help me to learn more.
Bravo!
We must talk alone.
Lady Beatrice will fetch you later.
Madonna Camilla is in the chapel.
Will you please wait here?
Yes. Thank you.
I know that Borgia sent you here for some evil purpose.
I've asked you here to give you warning.
- My husband is—
- Your husband again?
If any harm should come to my husband through you...
I will hate you until the death.
I promise you,
I know how to hate.
Or love, the twin of hate?
Do not betray his hospitality.
There will be peace between us, so long as you act peaceably.
So you've found our chapel.
Lovely, isn't it?
I come here every night.
It makes my sleep more peaceful.
Sometimes I end by wishing that old age were slower in coming.
If old age brings wisdom such as yours, my lord, it comes too slowly to suit me.
You find my wife attractive, don't you?
Only with the deepest respect,
Signore.
- Words!
- I regret that Your Lordship thinks ill of me.
- I think ill of no one.
- Your Lordship is tolerant.
I am tolerant of nothing that might affect Madonna's honor.
But the certainty I have of her excludes jealousy, suspicion and such claptrap.
Mind you, she's a Baglioni.
Her blood's hot enough.
She's as capable of going to the devil as any other of her house.
But I'm certain of this. If she does go, she won't sneak about it.
She'll tell me first.
That's my certainty and my pride.
No, I don't think ill of you.
I've lived 70 years, and I know that in spite of the poets... youth is not the happiest season.
I'll not detain you longer.
Incidentally, I'll return this to her.
I can hardly wait till spring to see what they look like.
Each year we tolerate winter... because it brings us the new flowers of spring.
Some—
Will you excuse me, my dear?
Give me a thousand men and enough food and ammunition...
I could hold this place until the enemy either starved to death or died of old age.
But the way it's left unguarded now.
Good morning, my lord.
Good morning.
Of all Città del Monte, this is my favorite place.
Whenever I'm troubled, whenever
I need to work out a difficult problem...
I come here, and always
I find the solution.
- It's frightening. A loose pebble, a gust of wind and—
Are you afraid of death?
Well, I can't say that I have any great affection for it.
Look below you, my friend.
For 70 years,
I've watched the seasons change.
I've seen the vibrant life of summer, the brilliant death of fall... the silent grave of winter.
And then, I've seen
the resurrection of spring— the glorious birth of new life.
And my father and my father's father have seen it before me.
Nothing ever dies, my friend.
You don't believe that,
do you?
I don't have your wisdom, my lord.
I believe that I was born and that I must die... and that I must make the best of what lies between the two extremes.
My lord, the gardeners have finished
and are waiting for further instructions.
No need for you to run uphill to tell me that.
We haven't much time before winter sets in. Won't you come along now?
Excuse me.
Perfect.
Absolutely heaven-sent.
Whenever we wish, we give the old man a problem to think out.
He comes up here and—
I thought a courtier and cavalier left daubing with paint to the craftsmen.
Your lord husband finds pleasure in work one usually leaves for gardeners.
His roses are the most beautiful in Italy.
It's not for me to say the same for my painting.
You have a certain skill.
Fair for an amateur.
I try, Madonna. I try.
One can do no more.
You've missed none of the evil in his face.
Judas Iscariot was evil.
I imagine you find painting beauty more difficult.
I paint what I see and feel, Madonna.
If one is beautiful inside as well as out... my brush can neither take from nor add to that beauty.
Actually, it's quite good.
Are you as good with women?
I have been very successful with women.
Perhaps—
When you have finished this... perhaps you would do some of my ladies.
That is, if you have nothing else to do.
Perhaps Madonna herself.
Perhaps.
I will need to ask my lord husband.
Ah, come in, come in,
Messer Orsini.
- Thank you for coming.
- Your Lordship is ill?
Hibernating, my friend.
Hibernating.
Let those who will play winter games.
I'm for enjoying the snow by reading a book in a warm room.
And you, I'm told, pass the time in painting.
Daubing's a better name for it.
Come closer.
Do sit down, please.
Why do you paint?
- Helps to pass the time.
- Do you love it?
I can't say that I love it.
It amuses me.
Are you afraid of the word "love"?
No, I'm not afraid of it, my lord.
It's just that I— I have no use for it.
- And yet you dream of ruling men and nations.
- My lord presumes.
A prerogative of age.
But don't misunderstand me.
I'm no sentimentalist about love.
I'm not even as romantic about it as I used to be.
But I believe one cannot understand anything properly... until one has learned to love it.
It's true of my roses and it's true of people.
I'm afraid I haven't sufficient knowledge to debate the subject.
You're lying.
Your Lordship speaks carelessly.
You're lying, not to me, but to yourself.
There is something that you love... something beyond... this deceitful and murderous game you're playing now.
It is better if I assume
Your Lordship is ill.
With Your Lordship's permission.
Wait!
While you're brooding over my delirious ravings...
I'd appreciate it if you'd do a portrait of my wife.
She tells me you have an extraordinary understanding... of the art of painting and a great talent for it.
She's too kind.
But there is news, Magnifico!
Cesare moves on Capua, blood flows again in Faenza...
Naples trembles and
Florence sounds with alarms.
All sure signs of spring.
Does no one notice the return of the birds or the budding of fruit trees?
Your Lordship speaks as one afflicted with lovesickness.
A woman's ailment, eh, Belli?
Unworthy of men... and certain death for politicians.
I'll see you later.
When may I look?
You sat patiently for so many months,
Madonna. Have you no more patience?
A woman's entitled to a reasonable curiosity.
How do I know but what you've made me ugly as a witch?
Then my brush would lie.
Why should I expect the truth?
The portrait is finished, Madonna.
Do I look like that?
As I see you.
And I thought you were only a maker of compliments... a lord of ambitions and dark schemes.
And now, in my own portrait,
I see something else.
There's a great artist in you,
Messer Orsini.
I have much to learn.
You speak now with humility.
What's happened to all your quick, easy words?
Everything I know is stale. I—
I must find a new language to fit new definitions. Please don't say anything.
Your portrait, Madonna.
What is troubling you?
The change of season.
Spring is here.
And what was planted in the winter must soon begin to grow.
Well, there's no question about it. Spring is here.
It appears that Cesare Borgia... has decided to launch an attack against Camerino.
I am required to afford passage
for his troops...
and to levy a thousand men
for his service.
He assumes that I shall welcome this opportunity of showing my devotion to him.
I must think about this.
It concerns others besides myself.
- Show the captain to his quarters.
- Yes, my lord.
I hope you will be comfortable.
The vacation is over, eh, Orsini?
We'll see now which is more effective— pretty words or a sharp blade.
If Your Lordship will please follow me...
I'll show you to your quarters.
Magnifico, soon you'll have everything— wealth, position, fame, even love, greatness too.
You've sweated for this how many years?
All my life it seems.
And now only one last hurdle— a small one at that.
Speak up, Magnifico.
Give me your orders.
Could you kill that old man?
Consider it done.
Belli.
Signori, my course is plain.
Honor as well as duty... forbids me to give aid to this Cesare Borgia... a man I consider evil, false and perjured.
Therefore, I shall refuse
to assist him in this matter.
However, I have no right
to condemn you...
and your families
to the miseries of war.
You must decide for yourselves which you value more— liberty or life.
I shall accept your choice.
Your Excellency, you speak of liberty or life.
Life is cheap to Cesare Borgia.
To us, it is the most
we have to give.
Is it living to be a slave?
Are not life and liberty one and the same?
I say it is!
We will not have it said... that while others defied the power of Cesare Borgia... we meekly fixed his yoke on our necks.
Come to your senses.
You're throwing away fortune, success, life itself... for the sake of moonshine sentiments... that no enlightened man would take seriously.
Do you consider yourself an enlightened man, Belli?
Enough to know there's no profit in fighting lost causes.
I'm not so sure about that.
- I am!
- And if it be suicide—
I give you notice now
I'm withdrawing from your service.
You've betrayed not only
Cesare Borgia, but me.
- I'll not forget that.
- And to all those people, let them—
Nor will you forget what you have seen here at Città del Monte.
... who chose death to slavery.
Let them say
we who lived in honor...
knew also how to die in honor.
I offer one more sword against Cesare Borgia.
Bravo! Bravo!
We must strip the farms of everything edible.
We'll need all the food we can get to withstand a long siege.
- And Borgia's troops won't be able to live off the land.
- We'll not have time.
We'll make what time we can.
I know Borgia's technique.
First he'll send mounted troops.
Artillery will follow.
If Your Lordship agrees, we won't wait for him to attack the city.
We are not strong enough to meet Borgia's army in open battle.
But, my lord, does the wolf charge headlong at the bull?
No. He waits his chance, and then rushes in from the side to escape the long, sharp horns.
And he strikes at the weakest part— always the weakest part.
Wear this, my lord husband.
My love and my prayers for your safety.
My lord Orsini... this talisman for you, with my gratitude.
Thank you, Madonna.
I once had a friend— he was a saint in honor and justice... and he passed those virtues on to his only child.
When he died, she needed a refuge from the enemies of her family.
I married her to assure her that refuge.
He was my friend, and I made her my daughter.
And as I tend the beauty
of my roses... so I must always care for the beauty and the happiness of her soul.
They're coming into the wood.
They're coming into the clearing.
We're ready for your orders,
Your Lordship.
Charge!
We did it! We did it!
After them!
Follow them into the woods!
Cut them from behind! After them!
Andrea.
How is it with the battle, Andrea?
We've thrown them back to Fabriano.
The dogs should be straightly followed.
Give them no pause, Andrea.
- We're on their heels, Excellence.
- Good.
Am I alone?
No, my lord.
I'm here with Messer Andrea, your good friend.
Give me your hand, Andrea.
You've both been true to me.
I have understood.
Now be true to each other... and— and the people— always the people.
Direct your cannon fire closer to the wall.
The hot oil!
The hot oil!
Hot oil! Hot oil!
Madonna, we have held out for three months.
Now we've come to the end.
The people are dying of pestilence and starvation.
One more assault and we're done.
It remains only to provide measures for your safety.
- What measures?
- There's a secret exit from the city.
While Borgia's men pillage, you'll escape into the open... then on to Perugia, Venice or wherever you wish.
I marvel at you, Andrea.
No doubt.
A sad rogue.
I marvel that you think so badly of me.
I could not sneak off and beg for refuge while you and my people die.
Heroism is a shallow thing, Madonna, if it isn't rooted in wisdom.
I don't intend to be wise.
I can only be what I am.
Then I ask you to leave for my sake.
How can my leaving... serve you?
The book is closing for me, Madonna.
I have failed in all points— in art, in politics, in war.
But if you are safe,
I'll know at the very end... that my life was to some purpose.
It's been strange... our road together... and yet not together.
Please go.
- Captain Orsini.
- What is it, Fabio?
There are three Borgia men under a flag of truce at the city gates.
Do you know what they want?
Did they say what they want?
Yes, sir.
They say a parley.
A parley? Mattia, escort them to the council hall.
- Yes, sir.
- Fabio, call all our men into the square.
- Let it be swarming with soldiers.
- And leave the walls undefended?
Never mind. They must judge our strength by what they see.
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir.
If haggling's their game, our road may be longer than we thought.
Always the fox.
With a few tricks left.
Come, Madonna.
You must change your gown.
Wear your prettiest dress.
Hurry.
As commanding officer of the benevolent Duke
Cesare Borgia's forces engaged before your city...
I am authorized by His Excellence... to make certain proposals to Your Illustrious Signore... that he believes you will find to your advantage.
Does our fierce resistance force him to offer...
- what he had not first intended?
- Hold your tongue, madame!
- Watch your words, Esteban!
- Captain Orsini.
We cannot deny that the duke offers these terms... as a tribute to
Your Excellency's courage.
It would be a shame to Italian chivalry should harm come to you.
A thousand thanks, Signore.
Proceed with the terms.
First, in return for the surrender of your city... my lord duke engages to restrain his soldiers from looting... and take no vengeance on the people.
- What security does he offer?
- His illustrious word.
- The next?
- Second... my lord duke engages to permit the noble
Madonna Camilla to remain here...
provided that only a captain
appointed by the duke...
shall command the garrison and
assist her in the government.
And the next?
Third, these terms shall be considered null and void... unless the traitor calling himself Andrea Orsini...
be delivered alive into the hands
of Duke Cesare's officers... to be dealt with as His Excellence may determine.
Go back to your duke with my answer.
Tell him...
I will set torches to the city... rather than accept the conditions he offers.
- Madonna Camilla, I beg you to recons—
- I have spoken.
 Your ladyship's refusal
does credit to your courage.
But for this, many will suffer and die and this good city be laid waste.
How long do these terms stand?
Until tomorrow. Sunrise. Madame... understand the Duke Cesare will permit me to make no compromise regarding this gentleman.
I ask nothing... from your illustrious assassin... except that he withdraw... and leave us in peace.
I shall convey your answer exactly as you have phrased it.
Attenti!
Well, so much for that.
- We'll renew the defense.
- It will be our last.
I'm not afraid.
Captain Esteban!
Enter, Baglioni.
I bring Your Lordship a prisoner.
A good haul, Baglioni.
A very good haul.
I ask to be taken to Duke Cesare Borgia.
By his orders, I sit in his seat.
Well, sit lightly, my friend, lest you damage your brains.
You've a good tongue for cutting.
Since I'm not one for recriminations,
Messer Andrea...
I'll not review the history of your treason.
There is only the matter of a fitting punishment.
What's the difference, since to all intents and purposes, I'm dead already?
A reasonable deduction.
And yet, like so many dead ones,
I can still influence the living.
- You've surrendered, yet you intimate terms.
- Only one.
That you honestly fulfill those you have already offered.
What if I take your life now and do as I please about the terms?
You will conquer a dead city.
Every building will be razed by fire.
Every man, woman and child will be a corpse.
There will be even less glory than loot.
I will fulfill the terms.
- Put your promises in writing.
- My word—
Is not good enough to convince the noble Madonna Camilla... who, unfortunately, does not know you as well as I.
It will be in writing.
Scrivener.
Write this.
I, Don Esteban Ramirez... in the name of Cesare Borgia,
Duke Valentino and duke of Romagna...
in exchange for the immediate
surrender of Città del Monte...
- promise faithfully—
- And on my honor.
 And on my honor
to fulfill the following obligations.
Madonna Camilla...
I come from Rome, not as a conqueror... but as one who would create a bond of affection between us.
Is there something I can do to accomplish this?
I ask only one thing... but you would not grant it.
Ask and find out.
Grant the lord Orsini life and freedom.
I will obey your least wish and thank you with every breath.
This is most touching.
No, no, Madonna Camilla.
You must not kneel.
Such love is indeed rare, and I respect it.
What you ask is not impossible.
All will come right in the end.
I promise... you'll be surprised.
Your Signora's not eating.
I have no taste for food.
I promised to consider the case of the noble Orsini.
Since it concerns him, should we not invite him to table?
I haven't words to thank
Your Grace for this mercy.
Don't—
Don't speak of it. Esteban!
Enough of this.
Get out!
Guard, bring in the Messer Orsini.
There he is.
What do you think of him?
Look at him, Madonna. I'm showing him to you out of masquerade... in the clothes proper to his station and birth.
No, Madonna.
You'll stay here.
You need to be informed about this noble Orsini... who stands before you stripped of fraud... a peasant who posed as a noble.
Still want to marry this lying impostor?
I love and honor the lord Orsini.
The lady's swallowed his hook to the gills.
Well, he always had a glib tongue.
At least before he lost his voice.
You slander him when he has no voice to call you a liar with!
I've done all
I could for you, my lady.
Now I must protect my own reputation for truthfulness.
Don Esteban, see to it.
Yes, Your Magnificence.
Guard, bring in the woman.
Messer Belli will see to it that the lady does not leave her chair.
Yes, Magnificence.
And you were his friend.
Friend?
Messer Belli trades in friends,
Madonna.
And this Messer Belli has come up in the world.
He wears lace and brocade, carries a jeweled sword... and sits at Cesare Borgia's table.
Nor has there ever been a more
successful Judas than this Messer Belli.
As this peasant, Zoppo, can tell you.
Shh!
Oh.
Andrea, my boy.
What have they done to you?
Water.
- Water.
- Let her be.
You, bring a chair.
Drink, my son.
Drink slowly.
Oh.
Oh, my boy.
Oh, Mammina.
Mammina.
Merciful God.
They've almost killed you.
Why has he been tortured?
Why is he in chains?
You'll be informed in good time, woman.
- Is this your son?
- Yes.
Have you nothing to say to your true love now?
You need not have lied to me.
You love him less because he's a peasant.
Huh!
His peasant birth gave him something more... than all you highborn thieves and assassins could ever give him.
I cursed him once for this worthless fraud.
But I curse you even more for what you have done to him.
- I—
- No, wait. Cesare Borgia...
you will live after I am dead.
Let me thank you for this— last of all the things that you have taught me.
There is no victory in power, no— no honor in deceit, no future in living as— as you will live—
hated and despised by everyone.
Mammina, forgive me. I—
I've caused you great pain.
He's a lord of nobility and honor... to whom I offer all my love.
The comedy is finished.
My sentence, Andrea Zoppo—
Be merciful, my lord, as you hope for God's mercy.
- Take this woman out of here.
She has served her purpose.
Oh, no! No!
My sentence, Andrea Zoppo... is that tomorrow you shall be exposed in a cage on the castle tower.
There to remain as a spectacle and a warning... until your bones drop apart.
I protest Your Lordship's judgment!
This ungrateful peasant turned against Your Loving Highness... caused the death of hundreds of good troops...
created vast expenses
and endangered future revenues.
I've never seen a more notable treason!
You think I am being too merciful, Belli?
What punishment is there for a half-dead carcass to rot in a cage? Nothing.
- Let him think on his sins.
- You suggest a dungeon?
No, my loving lord, something blacker.
Gouge out his eyes.
Blind him and set him on the road with his hag mother to lead him.
And wherever he wanders, let him be a warning of the justice of your magnificence.
My friend, you're a man in a thousand.
I accept your advice.
Have sharpened stakes prepared and carry out the sentence. Remove the prisoner.
Wait, my lord!
What need is there of stakes when I have my two good thumbs?
Gouging's the thing.
And what need to remove him when I can pop his eyes out... right here for the amusement of this worshipful company?
Look now.
A quick pressure of the thumbs and out squirts the jelly.
- This ought to be a show worth watching, eh, Madonna?
Oh, don't be squeamish, Madonna.
You're as curious as I to see what a peasant's eyes look like out of their sockets.
Proceed, Messer Belli.
We'll all be grateful to you.
Guards, seat him and tie him to the chair.
Camilla, look at me.
Let me fill my eyes.
Take a good look at me.
I'm the last thing you'll see.
Scream! Do you understand? Scream! Scream!
Stop him! Stop him!
You devil, stop it!
The eyes of an artist and traitor!
Look! Pretty, aren't they?
They belong to Your Greatness.
Take that carrion away.
Hand him over to his mother.
He's had his fill of palaces. Let him grope his way back to a hovel. Come along, woman.
God pity him.
He was a gallant soldier.
There's no victory in this kind of war.
I shall continue to rely on you,
Captain Belli.
Your Magnificence has no more faithful servant than I.
Then my future is assured— depending on which one of us is hanged first.
Better, Mammina.
Go, go. Lie down.
Why, Belli!
Magnifico.
- Oh, Belli.
- Magnifico.
- Why did you wait so long—
- I have bad news for you.
- Huh?
- Madonna Camilla tried to follow after you.
- She was stopped, imprisoned in a cell.
- By Borgia?
No, Don Esteban. Borgia's gone with his army to move against Camerino.
But he left a strong garrison.
I— I can plan an ambush fast enough, use a knife or garrote with the best... but I have no brain for this.
It seems to me we're lost, completely helpless.
All the more reason then for settling down to the life God meant you to live.
There is a way of retaking Città del Monte if the people are willing.
I won't let you go back to this murdering.
The Borgia terror must stop somewhere.
Now one small spark will start a fire that will eventually burn down his house.
But I must get to the people.
You think they'll follow you?
You the peasant, Zoppo, against Cesare Borgia?
As they followed their own lord Verano.
I'll take an oath on that.
But the whole thing must be very carefully planned.
Success will depend upon stealth and exact timing.
Now, first we need to— to bring Mattia, Fabio... and some of the other leaders from Città del Monte here to Cresp—
How did you know to come here?
Who, me?
Speak up, Belli.
- Why, I— I've been here before.
- When?
On our return from Ferrara.
Then you knew all along that I was an impostor.
Naturally I profited from it— a thousand ducats.
I simply can't stand being loyal to one side.
I'm a born traitor.
The truth, Belli.
- I detest fine sentiments.
- Mmm. And yet?
I've discovered the devil doesn't always pay best.
This whole thing pleases me.
Who betrayed who, and where did it start? No matter.
It shall be said among my fellow practitioners in double-dealing... that I was the greatest of them all.
 This can only be accomplished
with accuracy and precision. Fabio.
- Yes, sir?
- You will lead your men into the piazza.
- Mattia.
- Yes, sir?
You will take your group into the garrison area behind the cathedral.
- Men must cover every guard post in the city.
- But we have no arms.
Use axes, sickles, anything.
But your most powerful weapon will be surprise.
Each must choose a man and wait until the right time.
- When do we strike?
- When you hear the tower bell.
It will be a signal that Madonna Camilla is safely out of the castle.
- Strike then, and not a second before.
- Who will bring her out?
I will. Messer Belli will give us another miracle.
He will open the right window at the right time for me.
Remember the signal. Madonna Camilla must be out of the castle before you strike.
And listen for the tower bell.
That will tell you that she's safely out.
When the tower bell rings, it means
Madonna Camilla is outside the castle.
Each choose a man.
When the bell rings, strike.
When the bell rings, strike.
All clear.
Orsini.
Guard!
Guard!
Guard!
In the garden— beautiful giris.
What's this?
Why, he's drunk.
That's all.
Wait. Let's see.
If a man can't hold his wine, I—
In his back!
Come with me.
Camilla.
Andrea. Andrea.
One guard stabbed. The other with a garrote around his throat.
- Ring the bell. Awaken the garrison.
- No! Not yet.
Do that and you'll warn whoever is here. Let's find them first.
The door to the secret passage's open.
Do as I command. Ring the bell!
It's not yet time!
I mean, we shouldn't frighten whoever they are.
This is no doubt a clever scheme to rescue Madonna Camilla.
Everyone involved will be executed.
Sound the alarm.
To ring that bell now would be a serious mistake.
- Why?
- That's a chance I'll take.
Something's gone wrong.
We must run for it.
Orsini!
Yes, Esteban.
It's me, Orsini.
- You're not blind!
- Maybe it's a miracle... but I see you, Esteban.
How I've prayed for this moment,
Don Esteban.
My hands are free now, not tied behind my back.
Orsini.
Get up.
I've killed enough for the Borgias.
Now is the time to ring the bell.
Ring the bell!
 Sometime, somewhere,
the Borgia terror must stop.
One small spark will start a fire
that will eventually burn down his house.
- With this ring—
- "With this ring"—
- I thee wed—
- "I thee wed"—
- and plight unto thee—
- "and plight unto thee"—
- my troth.
- "My troth."
Lassie Come Home is the story of a dog,
but it's also the story of a people
as strong and enduring in peace as they are in war,
the people of Yorkshire.
The county of Eric Knight's birth and boyhood.
This man is a Yorkshireman.
Sam Carraclough, and his dog, Lassie.
Lassie is Sam's only saleable possession
in the dark prewar days of unemployment, empty pockets
and the dole.
- Hello, Sam. You here, too?
- Hello, Tom. Ron.
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Lassie. Good day to you, my girl.
She looks champion, Sam.
Tell the truth, Tom.
Have you ever seen anything better?
No. I was only talking to my missis the other night, Sam.
That's just what I said to her.
I said, "If ever there was a better dog in all Yorkshire than Sam's Lassie,
"then she must've died before ever I was born."
That's what I said.
She's in pretty fair shape, she is, but I do believe her coat could be a wee bit shinier.
You know, Sam, they do say that cod-liver oil is good to make a dog's coat shiny.
Some of these fancy breeders give it to their dogs pretty regular.
If we could afford cod-liver oil for our dogs, perhaps we could get ourselves a little bit of beef once in a while.
It's Joe she's thinking of, at school.
- Has she ever been late, Sam?
- Never.
There seems to be something inside her telling her when it's time.
Go along, then.
Joe Carraclough.
Apply yourself to your lessons, lad.
Joe, lad! Must you always come in like thunder off the moors?
Sorry, Mother.
Lassie and me, we want some bread and jam. Don't we now, Lassie?
Bread you can have, but jam you'll do without.
If there's no jam, honey will do.
Honey, is it?
There's some nice beef dripping I have and that's what you'll get.
- Thanks, Mother.
- Here you are, lad. Now run along.
- Have a good time with Lassie today.
- I will, Mother.
But why especially today, Mother?
Did I say today especially, lad?
I didn't mean to. Now run along.
Hello, Father.
- Did thou see the Duke today, Sam?
- Aye. He'll be by tomorrow.
Here you are.
Hello, Lassie.
All right, girl.
Downstairs. Come on, downstairs.
All right, I'll get up.
Why, Father!
Look, Father. Look what I've taught Lassie.
You seem worried, Father.
Is it about your work?
No, lad. It's not that.
But whatever trouble comes, remember, we've got to be men together.
- Do you see?
- Aye, Father.
Make haste, now.
You'll be late for school. Come.
Thank you, Lassie.
What's the matter, Lassie?
Don't you want me to go?
I'll be out at 4:00, as usual.
Bide well, Lassie.
She's a beauty, Carraclough.
She's just come back from seeing my lad to school, sir.
Fifteen guineas.
Wasn't that the price you said?
Yes, sir.
I got the best of it, Carraclough.
I am an honest man, so I got to tell you I got the best of it.
- Are you quite sure you want to sell her?
- No, Your Grace.
- I have to.
- It's a fair price.
Put a collar on her and lead her from the back of the cart.
- Yes, sir.
- Get a move on.
Good day, Mrs. Carraclough.
Good day, Carraclough.
All right, Rogers.
Happen we should be telling Joe?
He'll be finding this out for himself.
Mother!
Mother, something's happened to Lassie.
She didn't meet me at school today.
What is it? What's wrong?
You may as well know it right off.
Lassie won't be waiting for you at school anymore.
Why not? What's happened?
Because she's sold, that's why not.
Sold?
Why did you sell her?
Lassie. Why did you sell her?
She's sold and gone and done with it.
Let's say no more about it.
- But, Mother...
- No more. Sit down and have your tea.
Sam, come and eat.
Now look what you've done.
Got thy father all angry.
I suppose you're happy now.
Come on, Joe. Eat up.
I don't want any.
Dogs.
If you ask me, I'm glad Lassie's gone.
That I am.
More trouble to take care of than a child.
Now it's done, I'm glad.
I'm glad, that I am.
Come here, Joe.
Look, Joe, you're getting to be a big lad now, and you can understand.
Lassie cost a lot of money to feed, and we've got to have food on the table.
We've got to pay the rent, and we just couldn't afford it.
And that's all.
These are poor times, Joe.
You mustn't upset your father.
He's worried enough as it is, and...
That's all.
She's gone.
Couldn't we buy her back someday?
No, Joe.
Lassie was a very valuable dog, much too much for us.
But we'll get another dog someday.
Just wait.
Times might pick up and we'll get another tyke.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
I don't want any. I only want Lassie.
Priscilla, I'm going down to the kennels.
Hynes.
Don't know what the world's coming to.
Servants no good.
- Country's going to pot.
- Nonsense.
- What's that?
- I said, nonsense.
I thought that's what you said.
Fine state the world's in when the only person with courage enough to answer me back is my own granddaughter.
That's 'cause you're like me, my dear.
Look, I'm glad you turned up.
I want to show you my new dog.
Finest collie I ever set eyes on.
- I've been after her for three years.
- Three years?
Three years. Last year,
I offered the fellow 15 guineas for her.
Told him it was my rock-bottom limit.
He didn't seem to think so.
Held out for another six months.
Then the other day, he told me he'd take it.
Was she worth waiting for all that time?
Worth it?
You never saw another one as good.
Look at her.
She's beautiful.
Collie.
She doesn't seem well, Grandfather.
Nonsense. Nothing wrong with the dog.
Nothing at all.
Hynes! Where on earth is that idiot hiding?
- Hynes!
- Coming, Your Grace.
Yes, sir, you called me?
Hynes, what's the matter with that dog?
She looks a bit off-color.
Sir, they spoil them in them there cottages.
Treat them with a silver spoon, as you might say.
But I'll see she gets over it.
She'll take her food kennel-way in a while.
You keep an eye on that dog, Hynes.
- Yes, sir, I will.
- You'd better.
If you don't, I'll tan your hide, my lad.
That's what I'll do.
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Come along, child.
I'll see you eat before I'm through with you.
I'll see you eat, if I have to shove it down your throat.
Lassie, you've come back.
Mother, I've got a surprise for you.
Lassie's come home.
I was coming out of school and there she was, waiting for me right where she always is.
- I could see she was lonely for all of us...
- No.
But, Mother, she's come home.
- We could hide her. We could say...
- No!
Now get her out of here.
Before you know it, we'll have that Hynes around here, that know-it-all Hynes.
Father, you might at least say something to her.
It isn't her fault that she's happy to be home. Just pat her.
You know, happen they don't know how to care for her right up at the kennels.
I wonder if they understand how to feed her properly.
The men in this village think more of their tykes than they do of their own flesh and blood.
But truly, Mother, she does look thin.
I do believe they're not feeding her right.
I wouldn't put it past that Mr. Know-it-all Hynes to steal the best part of the dog meat for himself.
By gum, she does look a bit poorly.
I better get her a little something.
She could do with it, or I don't know dogs.
But the minute she's fed, back she goes.
That's no way to do it, lad.
If you're going to do a job, learn to do it right.
Sit, girl. Here, now.
Now, Sam, that's enough brushing.
Let her eat her food, and take her back to where she belongs.
You wouldn't have me take her back looking like a mucky Monday wash.
Look, Sam, if you don't hurry her back soon...
It's that man Hynes.
I thought so.
I thought as how I'd find her here.
I was cleaning her up a bit, then I were off to bring her back.
Yes, I'll bet you was.
It so happens I'll take her back myself, seeing as how I happened to drop in, as you might say.
I wasn't born yesterday.
I know all about you Yorkshiremen and your come-home dogs, training them to run back home, so you can sell them to someone else.
It won't work with me,
'cause I know a trick or two myself, I do...
Well, good evening.
I won't have him walking in here and keeping his hat on as if he's the very Duke himself.
And all on account of a dog.
She's gone.
And if you ask me, good riddance!
Now happen we can have a little peace.
I hope I never see her again. I do that!
You won't get out now, milady.
Not if I know anything.
Come on. Where is she?
- So that's why he's not home.
- Aye.
They're together, him and Lassie.
She's got away again.
He's run away with her so that we can't take her back.
Come now, lass, don't thee worry.
The lad will not have gone far.
I think I know where he'll be.
I'll be off to find her.
Come on, now, where's that there dog of mine?
Take thy hat off.
Don't you start no trouble.
You better not start no trouble now.
Get along home with you. The dog will be there as soon as I can find her.
It's all right, Lassie.
We can live out here on the moors, and they'll never find us.
We can live in the caves.
Happen I can run errands for the butcher, and he'll give me scraps of meat for you, and perhaps even a bone.
And then we'd never have to go home.
The Duke will never find you.
And we can always be together.
Come on, lad.
- For me?
- Yes.
Thank you, dear.
Who are those people, Grandfather?
- What are you doing with my dog?
- It's Lassie, sir.
I'm not blind, my good man, but what are you doing with her?
She's run away again, and I'm bringing her back.
What, again? Has she run away before?
I'm bringing her back again, sir.
- Hynes!
- Coming, Your Grace.
Has this dog ever run away before?
- Sir, it's this way...
- Did she or didn't she?
In a way, sir, she did.
She dug her way out.
I didn't want to disturb you about her, and I'll see she don't get away again.
Yes, you'd better. You're an idiot, Hynes.
I'm beginning to think you're an utter nincompoop. Pen her up.
If she gets out again, you can get out, too.
- Thank you for bringing her back.
- Yes, sir.
I'll pen her up.
And if she ever tries to get away... Here.
I brought my lad with me today to pen her up.
It's him she runs home to see.
He'll pen her up and bid her stay.
I'm sorry I didn't notice
I was stepping on thy foot.
- The kennels are over here.
- Come along, Joe lad.
Come on, now. Get in with you.
Come along, Lassie, get inside here.
Come on.
Come along now, lad.
Get it over with. Bid her stay, and tell her she can't be coming home no more.
Stay here and bide happy, Lassie.
Don't come home no more.
Don't run away no more, because thou doesn't belong to us anymore.
We're not allowed to see thee ever.
You've got a nice place here, so don't plague us by come running home.
Stay here and leave us be.
Don't ever come home again.
- Please, Joe.
- What do you want?
I hope you won't worry too much about Lassie.
I'll take care of her. Really, I will.
I'll take care of her for you.
So you won't have to worry any at all.
There's nothing much you can do with these fine kennels and a special man and all to take care of her.
But there must be something I can do, isn't there, now?
When her coat gets a little dull, you might try straining her water through some linseed.
- That picks her up a bit.
- I will.
Is there anything else?
Come along, Joe lad. Come.
It isn't good for her to be in that cage all the time.
Lassie likes a good walk, Lassie does.
She needs the exercise.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Poor Lassie.
Poor Lassie.
Poor girl.
You're not angry with me, are you, Father?
No, Joe. A father can't get truly angry at his own lad. Never.
It's just that he wants you to understand how things are.
And you mustn't think we're too hard on thee.
We don't want to be.
It's just that...
Back of it all, Joe, a chap's got to be honest.
Never thee forget it all thy entire life.
And there's a funny thing about honesty.
There's no two ways about it.
There's only one way about it.
Honest is honest. Do you see?
It's about Lassie you're talking.
Joe, when you've sold a chap something, and you've taken his brass, and you've spent it, then done is done.
Lassie was sold, and that's all.
- But we always fed her before.
- Before, I was working.
You can't feed a dog on the dole, and you can't feed a family on it, either.
- No, Joe, Lassie's better off.
- Maybe she'll get away.
No, lad, nay.
The Duke's taking her off to Scotland.
- Scotland?
- Aye.
Her and half a dozen other likely show dogs.
As soon as the shows are over, she's to go back to Scotland, and she's never to come to Yorkshire anymore.
Keep your head up. Keep it up, I say.
Good morning, Your Grace, Miss Priscilla.
- So how is she, Hynes?
- Looking better, Your Grace.
It must be this here Scottish air.
It seems to agree with her.
Her coat could be shinier.
Looks a little dull to me.
If you try straining her water through some linseed, it would make her look better.
Linseed, Miss Priscilla?
My dear, how did you know about that?
I just happen to know, that's all.
Somebody told me once.
It's an old Yorkshireman's trick, and a very good one.
- You better try it, Hynes.
- Yes, sir.
Come along, child.
Can't keep the horses waiting all day.
Linseed.
Keep your head up. Keep it up, will you?
- Grandfather!
- All right, coming.
A fella can't even take a ride in peace.
Now what's the matter, child?
Lassie. She's chained, Grandfather.
She needs exercise, and she can't get it that way.
- Hynes!
- Coming, Your Grace.
Hynes, what's that dog doing on a chain?
Sir, I had to do it.
Every afternoon she tears and scratches at her pen and might do herself an injury.
You told me to be sure not to let her escape again.
I never said put her on a chain.
No dog of mine goes on a chain, understand that!
- That dog needs exercise.
- But, sir, if I let her...
Put her on a leash and walk with her yourself, lazy idiot.
- I want that dog in perfect condition.
- Yes, Your Grace.
Never mind about, "Yes, Your Grace."
Do as you're told.
Come along, child.
So you have to have a walk, do you, milady?
I'll walk you. I'll more than walk you.
Come on. I suppose you'd like to have me late for my tea.
Hurry up, will you?
You're always hanging behind.
Come on, will you?
Here, what's the matter?
Down! Do as I tell you, can't you?
I'll break your blasted neck if you don't behave yourself. Go on!
Here, Lassie!
Nice girl, nice dog.
Don't you move. Now stay there.
Stay there, Lassie. Nice girl.
Stay there, now. Don't you move.
Come on, Lassie. That's a nice dog.
Come on. Here.
Lassie, come here!
Come here.
Here, Lassie, come here.
If I ever get my hands on you, milady, you'll never get away again, I'll tell you.
Exercise. That's what I get for walking you.
Close the gate, Miss Priscilla!
Don't let her get out! Close it!
Close the gate!
You've let her go.
That's what she's done, she's let her go.
She's going toward south, Grandfather.
- She's going toward Yorkshire.
- By Jove, child, I believe you're right.
- Over there.
- Aye. There.
Let him have it, lad. Fly, lad, let fly.
I cannot do it. It does not look like one of they devils to me.
It's a stray. You've got a right to shoot.
Let's see whether it gangs near the sheep first.
If it does, I'll shoot it.
There, it's seen us.
Let him have it.
- I hit it.
- You didn't. Look at it go.
Go on, Satan, get him. Sic him.
You cannot try shooting now, Jock.
You might hit my Satan.
Unless I'm mistaken, Andrew, there goes your Satan now.
Now, Jock. Now shoot.
Losh, man, why did you no shoot?
She but a brave dog, and she be going somewhere.
And besides, I could not shoot for I forgot to load up again.
Forget?
I should think a soldier would never forget to load up again after he's fired.
Well, laddie, we have so many things to remember.
It's wonderful, the things they have nowadays.
There were no pencils when I were a lad.
We had only slates.
Morning, Father. Morning, Mother.
- Many happy returns, Joe.
- Thank you, Mother.
Bless thee, lad.
- We've got a surprise for thee, lad.
- You can have three guesses.
Lassie!
It isn't Lassie, Joe.
It's just this.
Mother, it's champion. Thank you.
Thank you, Father.
It's champion.
Dan, don't you hear something?
Down by the chickens.
The door of the chicken coop is a bit loose.
If I weren't so lazy,
I'd have fixed it long since.
There again. There is something.
If you won't go and see who's after your chickens, Dan'l Fadden, I will.
Now, sit ye down.
If you want me to go, I'll go.
I'll look around, or you won't be sleeping tonight.
Dally!
All right, Dan. I'm coming.
- It's a dog.
- What?
A dog.
You poor, poor thing.
Now, who left you out on a night like this?
Dan, I think we have to carry him.
That's the last of the milk, Dally.
Won't be any for your tea tomorrow morning.
It won't matter, Dan.
I often think we do things just from habit.
In America, they say that they always drink their tea without milk.
Happen that's because they haven't learned any better.
Do you know, Dally,
I do believe she swam the river.
Swam the river?
Whatever makes you think that?
I saw her draggly trail all through the mud.
- It came from the river.
- Did you swim the river, girl?
Did you swim all that way to get from Scotland into England?
Dan, she doesn't seem to be swallowing.
- What?
- Do you think she's dying?
I don't know, Dally.
Best thing we can do is just to let her be.
I think I'll sit up with her tonight.
- Now, Dally, you've done your best.
- But she might need some help.
She's such a bonny dog, Dan.
Such a bonny dog.
Well, Dan?
Dally, I've asked all around the place.
Everywhere.
Nobody seems to have lost her.
Then she's ours.
You're ours, girl.
We've given them their chance, Dan.
Now she's ours.
Now, Dally, they might pass by chance and see her.
- So, don't...
- She's ours now, Dan.
I'm keeping her in the house or locking her in the back garden.
- I'm not letting anyone see her.
- How about the owner?
If it hadn't been for us, she'd have been dead now.
We are her owners.
What's the matter, girl?
Now, girl, you don't want to go out again.
Come back here and lie down.
Better put the kettle on.
What's wrong with you, girl?
You've been out for a nice walk with me on a string.
Surely you can lie down now.
Dally, I think you're daft.
I tell you, she's not happy here.
Nonsense. Every time she winks an eyebrow, you'll think she's got the measles, or the plague, or I don't know what.
- There, now, she's all right.
- But every afternoon it's the same.
She's not happy here.
Dan, do you know what I think?
What?
I think she's sorry for us, so she just puts up with us.
Like she's too polite to run unless we tell her to go.
Now, Dally, no dog can be full of things like that, like human things.
My Herself can. You don't know her, Dan.
You see, Dan, I know about this dog.
- I know something.
- What?
She's going somewhere.
She's on her way.
Now, woman. What fancies are you building up in your mind?
No, I don't care. I know.
Me and Herself, we both know.
She just stopped here like at a hospital or a wayside inn.
But now she wants to be on her way.
Only, she's too polite and understanding.
She doesn't want to hurt us.
All right, Dally.
If at 4:00 she makes up her mind to go, then, all right.
I believe it was a flea.
There are no fleas on Herself,
I'd have you know.
I do believe it's time.
All right then, dog.
If you must go, away with ye.
Goodbye, Herself.
Goodbye.
Good luck.
I'll put a lamp in the window, Dally, for tonight, like perchance she's just going for a long run.
Toots.
Come on, then.
Thank you, girl. Thank you.
There. In many ways, Toots, you're better than a wife.
You're neat, you're clean, and when you're around, a man gets no backchat.
We best be going.
What's the matter, Toots?
Come on, girl.
So you've smelled food?
There's plenty for all of us, isn't there, Toots?
Here, come on.
Come on, then.
You're frightened.
I won't hurt you.
I'll leave food here for you.
You can eat it up at your leisure. Aye.
She's a well-trained dog, isn't she, Toots?
She'll not make friends with strangers, nor take food from them, either.
Still, perhaps we can make friends with her, Toots.
What do you say?
What's that old proverb?
"A friend in need is a friend indeed."
We'll see.
She'll be friendly-like when she smells this. Won't she, Toots?
You bet she will.
Giddap, Stogie.
Whoa, Stogie.
Milady don't want to go this way, Toots.
Sitting there like a graven image, she is.
Looks like she wants to take t'other road.
And what would you do if a friend of yours wanted to take t'other road?
Aye, that's right.
I can just as well go round Godsey as by Manning.
Here's your dinner. Eat it up.
Didn't I say we knew a thing or two about tykes, Toots?
Throw meat on the road and it's no go.
She's a lady, Toots, and only be eating out of bowls.
Not like you and me.
I'm afraid we'll have to mend our table manners, Toots.
Here's a few more words you can mark down, Toots.
Before the end of the week, she'll be helping us in our act.
Come on, then.
Up.
Coming along, girl? Come on.
Bowls and pots, I've got lots.
Bring out your penny or you won't get any.
Come on, ladies, don't be bashful. Step up.
You all know me.
Rowlie Palmer. I come here every year.
Feel that.
- How much?
- Couple of bob to you, and cheap at that.
- How much is it?
- A bob. Tea for two for a bob.
Here! Stepped on by elephants!
Yes, kicked by hippopotami!
It's that strong, you couldn't break it with an ax.
When does Toots do her tricks,
Mr. Palmer?
Why, immediately, my little love.
Make way there, will you?
Give the dog a bit of room.
Let the dog see the rabbit, immediately.
Toots will come out, and Toots will surprise you.
That's right. There.
One, two, three, four.
All right, Toots.
All right, Toots. You can begin now.
Why, what's the matter?
You're waiting for someone.
Her Majesty hasn't arrived for command performance, is that it?
Why, here she comes now.
Now, Toots, go and pick up blue ring.
Come on.
There.
Now then, not many little dogs could go through this hoop but you could, couldn't you, Toots?
Come on.
Now, Toots, how about a nice ride on the ball?
But doesn't the collie do anything?
Why, you wouldn't expect royalty to perform, would you?
Would you like to do some work, girl?
Would you like to pick up these things?
Pick up these things!
May it please Your Majesty, as a favor to me, will you please pick up the things?
You see? Always remember to say
"please" and you get more in this world.
Thank you, ladies. Goodbye, one and all.
Show's over. I'll be back again next year.
Rowlie, it was grand.
I loved it even more than me pot.
- Doing all right, ain't he?
- Not half, he ain't.
Don't forget, money back if not satisfied, thou knows.
There's a good dog.
I think she'll be an addition to our act, don't you, Toots?
Here, come on.
That's a girl.
There, you've been good dogs.
Go and play. You did a good show today.
Excuse me, milady. I forgot.
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
Here.
She's a fine dog, Toots, but she'll never be as smart as thee, my sweetheart.
Mucky weather ahead, if I know it.
Smells like winter to me, Toots.
There's the smell of snow.
We'll be getting home soon.
There'll be a warm, fire-lit hearth waiting us, and roasting chestnuts, and a good bone for you, and maybe a nip or two of something invigorating for me.
Hold your dogs.
It's all right. We ain't doing nothing.
Quiet, both of you. Get back.
That's good of you, mate.
What you having, tea?
Aye.
Ain't that nice? Could you just spare two homeless chaps what's looking for work a couple of swallows to warm them up?
Aye.
No, you don't.
Come on, now. Where is it? If you're nice and hand it over without trouble, we won't hurt you. Will we, Snickers?
Of course not, Buckles.
- We won't so much as touch him.
- That's right.
But if you're looking for trouble, we'll let you have it. Where is it?
If you'll just give me time,
I'll hand it right over to you.
Go on, before I give you another one.
You blooming little rat!
You dirty swine.
Come back, girl.
You were a good one.
Weren't you?
You were a good one.
Will you come up and sit beside me,
Your Majesty?
Will you keep me company going home?
Come here, Your Majesty.
You won't come, then?
Perhaps it's best at that.
I'd like to go on with you, but stock's low, and I must be getting back home for winter.
Besides, you'd never really fit in with me like Toots did.
And you'd always be reminding me of her.
Not that you haven't been a good dog.
You understand a lot, don't you?
Forgive me.
At first I thought you were a coward.
But it's not that, nay.
There's summat else about thee, my lass.
And I'd dearly love to be inside thy mind and know what it is.
That's the pity of it.
You can understand some of man's language but man isn't bright enough to understand thine.
And yet it's us that's supposed to be the most intelligent.
You know, sometimes I think you didn't come along with me as much as you let me come along with you, as long as our roads lay together.
And now, you'll be off about whatever business it is you're on.
I'll be lonely.
No thee, and no Toots.
But then, I always did say,
"If a man doesn't like to be alone,
"he shouldn't never pick the job of traveling peddler."
That's goodbye.
May luck go with thee.
Off you go.
On you go, then.
And good luck.
There's a likely looking collie.
Aye, and it's got no license on it.
- No luck, Sam?
- No luck.
And a hole in my right shoe, for my pains.
I must have walked 20 miles today.
"No work," they say,
"and hundreds out of work, like you."
Do you know what Joe says?
He says Lassie took our luck.
He does say that when Lassie were home, things were better.
There's no luck about it.
When a man wants work and can't get it, it's summat more than luck.
I know. There's no sense to it.
I was just saying what Joe said.
He's a good lad, Sam.
He is. A good lad.
She's come all the way from Scotland.
Poor dog.
She must have traveled hundreds of miles.
- You better get her a little milk.
- There isn't any milk, Sam.
There's just a little bit of stew for supper.
Is it too good for her?
No, of course not.
I kept it for her, Sam. I don't know why.
Poor thing. She hasn't eaten for so long, she can't.
We've got to scrape up enough somewhere for a little milk.
Come along.
- Shan't be long, Rogers.
- Yes, Your Grace.
Sam, it's the Duke. He must have heard.
- He'll not have her.
- What shall we do?
Hurry, Sam.
Right in there.
If she wants our lad and our home as bad as this, then here she should stay.
- Good day, Mrs. Carraclough.
- Good day, Your Grace.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you. Come along, Priscilla.
- Good day to you, Carraclough.
- Good day, sir.
All right, my dear child.
Mrs. Carraclough, this is my granddaughter, Priscilla.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, child?
- And this is Mr. Carraclough.
- How do you do, miss?
- Carraclough, about my dog...
- Dog, sir?
Yes, Lassie. She got away.
That's too bad, sir. Isn't it, Helen?
- It is a pity indeed.
- Aye.
I thought there was a chance, very slight, that you...
We haven't set eyes on her, sir. No, sir.
We'll be lucky if we ever get another dog like her.
Yes, sir, indeed we will.
She was a fine dog.
Yes, of course.
By the way, Carraclough, are you working?
- Working, sir?
- Yes, a job. Do you understand?
- Now, it's like this...
- Not exactly, sir.
There are three or four things he's considering but he hasn't quite said yes or no to any of them yet.
Really? He better say no and say it quickly.
I need a fellow up at my kennels.
I think, Carraclough, that you're the very fellow for the job.
I, sir?
I, to get paid for working with dogs?
- Will you take the job?
- You see, I...
Of course he will, sir.
He will? Good, splendid, excellent.
We'll make the judges at Crufts sit up, won't we, Carraclough?
Aye. Indeed we will, sir.
What was that?
What was what, sir?
Just a minute.
No, you're wrong, sir.
If you're thinking it's Lassie, you're entirely wrong.
How could a poor dog come all the way from Scotland?
- Just a minute, Carraclough.
- Yes, sir.
You can see that's a poor tyke we picked up on the road.
You can see that's not the dog.
She has no breeding, no blood.
- That'll do, Carraclough.
- Yes, sir.
- Priscilla?
- Yes, Grandfather.
Have you ever seen this dog before?
- No, Grandfather.
- Neither have I.
I thought for a minute, but I was mistaken.
This is no dog of mine.
Upon my soul and honor, this dog never belonged to me.
Come along, child. We've got to be going.
- Carraclough.
- Yes, sir?
That dog looks to me as if she needs a lot of care.
She does that, sir.
She'll get all the care she needs up at my kennels.
- Indeed she will, sir.
- Goodbye, Carraclough.
- I'm so glad you're going to be with me.
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Carraclough.
- Goodbye, Your Grace.
- Come along, child.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, child.
Thank you, sir.
Do you think he knew?
Bless you, he knew.
She's our Joe's Lassie again.
We'll soon have thee well again, girl.
She wants to meet Joe.
But the poor thing's so weak.
We shouldn't let her go, Sam.
Aye, but she's walked hundreds of miles to see our lad.
- I'll not rob her of that now.
- Then wait.
So he'll know.
Off you go now.
Lassie!
You're my Lassie come home.
TAKE ON FUEL RIGHT AWAY.
WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NORTH
SECTOR IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
VERY GOOD,
MR. WORTHING.
HOW ARE YOU,
MR. WORTHING?
HELLO, JIM.
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
FOR OVER A WEEK.
IT'S A BIG TERRITORY. I'VE BEEN
PUSHING THROUGH DAY AND NIGHT.
WHISKEY AND SODA?
A LITTLE TONIC WATER.
THE BOYS WILL BE GLAD TO SEE
YOU-AN EXCUSE FOR A CELEBRATION.
A VISITOR'S
QUITE AN EVENT.
EVEN WHEN
IT'S THE BOSS?
EVEN WHEN
IT'S THE BOSS.
ALL CELEBRATIONS ARE OUT, AND
ALL LEAVES, JIM, FOR THE DURATION.
BUT A WHITE MAN CAN'T TAKE THIS
AFRICAN CLIMATE AS A STEADY DIET.
WE TOOK IT
IN THE OLD DAYS
WITHOUT ANY FANCY
REFRIGERATORS, ELECTRICITY,
AND AIR CONDITIONING
GADGETS.
BELIEVE ME, JIM, YOU'RE
GOING TO TAKE IT, TOO.
WITH THE JAPS IN MALAYA, WE
NEED RUBBER... AND MORE RUBBER.
WE'RE PRETTY NEAR
OUR LIMIT NOW.
WE'VE DOUBLED OUR
LAST YEAR'S OUTPUT.
TRIPLE IT. QUADRUPLE IT. THANKS.
BUT THE LABOR.
FAIR TREATMENT AND GOOD WAGES
ALWAYS ATTRACT GOOD LABOR.
GO OUT IN THE BUSH
AND RECRUIT THEM.
HOW ABOUT EQUIPMENT
AND TRANSPORTATION?
DO WHAT WE DID
IN THE OLD DAYS.
THAT'S WHAT
WE STARTED WITH.
THERE WEREN'T ANY SCHOOLS
OR INFIRMARIES OUT HERE THEN,
AND THE PLAGUE WOULD
WIPE OUT A WHOLE DISTRICT,
BUT WE BROUGHT THE RUBBER IN
AND GOT IT DOWN TO THE COAST.
QUITE A DOPE
BACK IN 1910, HMM?
YES, IT WAS.
BLASTED HOT TODAY.
BET YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M THINKING, WITZEL.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU THOUGHT.
I'M THINKING HOW YOU'D
LIKE TO BE SAYING GOOD-BYE
TO THIS
PUTRID RIVER
AND THOSE STINKING
RUBBER POTS.
IT'S THE LAST TIME I'LL
EVER SMELL BUSH SWEAT.
AND BEST OF ALL, IT'S THE
LAST TIME I'LL EVER SEE YOU.
HAVE YOU
NOTICED ANYTHING?
THE NATIVES HAVE BEEN
LOOKING AT ME LATELY
IN A QUEER SORT OF WAY.
MAYBE THEY WONDER HOW YOU
CAN WALK WITHOUT A SPINE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
BELLY SICKNESS.
UMEELA.
HIM MUCH BELLY SICK.
TAKE HIM DOWN
TO THE WHITE JUJU.
NOTHING WRONG
WITH HIS BELLY.
IT'S HIS FOOT-
MAMBA BITE.
SEE IF THE OLD QUACK
CAN GET THE INFECTION OUT.
UTOTO.
OH!
BELLY SICKNESS.
OH, YES.
IT'S ALWAYS
BELLY SICKNESS.
WELL, BRING HIM IN.
DARBY!
OH.
UGH!
TAKE THAT RAG OFF HIM.
AAH!
GET ME THE ALCOHOL,
DARBY.
NO, NO, NO.
THAT WHITE BOTTLE.
THAT'S IT.
WELL, BLESS MY SOUL.
THAT'S EMPTY, TOO.
IT'S A GOOD JOB
THE BOAT IS DUE.
THAT'S TOO BAD.
AAH!
STINGS, EH?
YOU CAN IMAGINE
WHAT IT DOES
TO THE LINING
OF YOUR STOMACH.
OH, HELLO, WITZEL.
THOUGHT I'D DROP IN.
10 DEGREES COOLER
HERE THAN MY PLACE,
AND MUCH COZIER.
HA HA.
NO, THANKS. I WON'T
HAVE ANOTHER.
I...
I JUST HAD ONE.
YEAH. SO I NOTICED.
OH.
ANOTHER TOUCH OF FEVER?
FOR THE WHITE MAN,
IT'S ALWAYS FEVER.
FOR THE NATIVES,
IT'S ALWAYS BELLY SICKNESS.
YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
A PAPER OF QUININE?
DON'T YOU EVER PRESCRIBE
ANYTHING BUT QUININE?
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE SOME
YOURSELF FOR A CHANGE
AND LEAVE
MY WHISKEY ALONE?
I'VE TOLD YOU, WITZEL,
THAT A FEW MONTHS
IN A TEMPERATE CLIMATE-
OH, DROP
THAT BEDSIDE MANNER.
YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO
ASHLEY, YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.
AT LEAST I'M GLAD
HE'S GOING HOME.
OF COURSE YOU'RE GLAD. DOESN'T
MEAN A BLASTED A THING TO YOU
THAT I'VE GOT TO BREAK
IN A NEW JELLYFISH
THAT THEY'RE SENDING
OUT FROM THE HOME OFFICE.
AND I KNOW JUST
THE TYPE HE'LL BE-
COME OUT HERE WITH A WHOLE
SUPPLY OF STIFF LINEN COLLARS
AND ASK ME A MILLION
ASININE QUESTIONS AN HOUR.
"I SAY,
HOW'S THE HUNTING?
ARE THE NATIVES
FRIENDLY?"
THEN HE'LL GET HOMESICK AND
GO BACK HOME AND WRITE A BOOK
ABOUT "WHEN YOU'RE
DRIVING IN YOUR MOTOR,
DO YOU EVER STOP TO PONDER WHERE
WE GET THE RUBBER FOR YOUR TIRES?"
I CAN'T STOMACH
ANY MORE OF THEM.
HE MAY BE A VERY
CHARMING FELLOW.
I TELL YOU,
I CANNOT GO ON
LIVING MONTH AFTER
MONTH, YEAR AFTER YEAR,
WITHIN THE SAME
FOUR WALLS
WITH THE SAME MAN
ANY LONGER!
I'D FIND MYSELF
WAITING FOR HIM
TO PHRASE A CERTAIN
SENTENCE IN A CERTAIN WAY,
AND IF HE DID, IT
WOULD DRIVE ME MAD.
I KNOW...
AND IF HE DIDN'T, IT
WOULD DRIVE ME MAD!
I TELL YOU, WITZEL,
A FEW MORE YEARS OF THIS-
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES, STOP
DIGGING GRAVES, WILL YOU?
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
- A FEW MORE YEARS WILL FINISH ME.
I DIDN'T SAY SO.
NO, BUT YOU LOOKED IT!
WHY DON'T YOU
CLEAR OUT YOURSELF?
YOU'RE ALWAYS TELLING
EVERYBODY ELSE TO.
WELL, PERHAPS
THERE'S A REASON.
YEAH, NO MEDICAL BOARD TO
CALL A TURN WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK.
DRUNK?
WELL, YOU'RE
HALF-DRUNK NOW!
INDEED, I WISH I WERE.
GO ON AND TAKE IT. YOU'LL ONLY STEAL
IT WHEN MY BACK IS TURNED, ANYWAY.
IF I WERE
A YOUNGER MAN, WITZEL,
I WOULD RESENT
YOUR INNUENDOES.
YOU WOULDN'T
RESENT ANYTHING
WITH A DRINK HANGING
ON THE END OF IT.
THE BOAT!
THERE SHE IS!
THE BOAT! HA HA!
SOON WE'LL HAVE
LETTERS AND PARCELS
AND PAPERS TO KEEP US
BUSY FOR WEEKS! THE BOAT!
DOCTOR, DOCTOR!
WHERE ARE YOU?
THE BOAT'S COMING!
THE BOAT'S COMING!
I SAW THE SMOKE BEFORE
I HEARD THE WHISTLE.
DID YOU REALLY?
HEY, AND THE MAIL.
WE'LL GET THE MAIL.
I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO
SENTIMENTALISTS TOGETHER.
SEE YOU BEFORE
YOU GO, ASHLEY,
ALTHOUGH I DOUBT IF WE'VE
GOT ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
TO EACH OTHER
WE HAVEN'T ALREADY SAID.
I DOUBT IF I COULD RESIST
THE TEMPTATION, THOUGH,
OF HEARING YOU
SAY ONCE MORE,
"IT'S BLASTED HOT TODAY."
YOU HEARD THE WHISTLE,
DIDN'T YOU?
IT WASN'T
MY IMAGINATION, WAS IT?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I SAW THE SMOKE
WAY AROUND THE BEND.
SHE'S COMING,
AND I'M GOING.
NOTHING CAN
STOP ME NOW.
HERE. HAVE A DRINK.
OH, YOU'VE BEEN AWFULLY
DECENT TO ME, DOCTOR.
WHY IS IT
AFRICA'S NEVER GOT YOU?
WISH YOU COULD
COME BACK WITH ME.
WHY DON'T YOU QUIT?
HELLO, DOCTOR!
HELLO, PADRE.
ASHLEY.
PADRE!
I'M SO GLAD I DIDN'T
MISS YOU, ASHLEY.
I HAD TO WISH YOU
GODSPEED.
GLAD YOU CAME.
YOU LOOK
A LITTLE TIRED.
YES, MY CANOE HIT
A DRIFTING IRONWOOD LOG
AND CAVED IN THE SIDE.
SIT DOWN.
THE CREW BOYS
RAN IT ASHORE,
AND I WALKED
THE LAST 3 MILES.
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
READY TO LEAVE?
READY? OH, YES. I HAVE
BEEN PACKED AND REPACKED
THE LAST SIX WEEKS.
YOU'RE NATURALLY EXCITED.
EXCITED?
OH, NO, NO.
I'M NOT EXCITED.
NO, I'M JUST
CALM NOW
AND PEACEFUL LIKE.
LIKE MORPHINE
BEGINNING TO TAKE EFFECT.
YEAH.
OR THE PEACE OF
THE HEART AFTER PRAYER.
YOU TWO SOUND LIKE A COUPLE
OF COMMERCIAL TRAVELERS
ADVERTISING YOUR WARES.
HOW ARE YOU, PADRE?
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN WEEKS.
WELL, IT'S A LONG
BUSHWHACK.
I THINK I'LL SEE
THE QUEEN COME IN, TOO.
SKIPPER!
HELLO, ASHLEY!
HOW ARE YOU, DOC?
HELLO, SKIPPER!
TAKE COMMAND, TED.
SEE YOU AT WITZEL'S.
AYE, AYE, SIR.
SKIPPER, I'M COMING BACK
WITH YOU!
GOOD.
I'M GOING HOME!
HELLO, THERE!
WELL, HELLO, CAPTAIN!
GLAD TO SEE YOU, PADRE.
GLAD TO SEE YOU.
HAVE A DRINK?
NEVER BEEN KNOWN
TO REFUSE.
WHERE'S THE NEW MAN?
IN THE CABIN, FUSSING WITH HIS LUGGAGE.
WHAT TYPE OF MAN IS HE?
NOT BAD.
A BIT TOO CLEAN,
BUT SO WAS
WE ALL ONCE.
HERE WE ARE AGAIN, GENTS.
HELLO, TED.
HOW DO YOU DO, REVEREND?
HOW DO YOU DO, MR. WITZEL?
WELL, HERE WE ARE.
WE GOT SOME MAIL.
YES, THE MAIL.
SEEMS AGES SINCE
I HAD A LETTER.
NEVER MIND, ASHLEY.
YOU'LL BE WRITING US SOON.
ONE FOR YOU,
MR. WILBUR ASHLEY.
OH, THAT'S
A CATALOG.
DON'T DO THAT.
IT'S SOMETHING
TO READ.
"MR. WILBUR ASHLEY,
"MR. ASHLEY,
"ASHLEY,
ASHLEY"...
"ASHLEY!"
"ASHLEY."
"MR. HARRY WITZEL,
"MR. HARRY WITZEL...
WITZEL"...
UH...
"THE REVEREND MR. ROBERTS.
MR. ROBERTS."
UH...
"ROBERTS."
THANK YOU.
"MR. HARRY WITZEL."
AW, IT'S TOUGH, DOCTOR.
ARE YOU QUITE SURE
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ANY IN
THE BOTTOM OF THE BAG?
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.
NAH. THAT'S ALL
THERE IS, DOC.
SO THEY FORGOT YOU
AGAIN THIS TIME, EH, DOC?
TOO BAD.
OH, IT'S-IT'S
OF NO CONSEQUENCE.
NO DOUBT MY NEXT MAIL
WILL BE MUCH BIGGER.
OH, I BEG YOUR PARDON.
MY FAMILY'S GOING
TO PICK ME UP AT MADEIRA!
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
THEY'VE SENT 23
MISSIONARIES TO NEW GUINEA.
IMAGINE THAT-23.
WELL, TO THE NEXT MAIL.
THERE'S THE PASSENGER
COMING ASHORE, TED!
PILOT HIM UP!
AYE, AYE, SIR!
HERE'S YOUR CONSIGNMENT,
WITZEL.
ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE YOU,
SKIPPER.
THANK YOU, DOC.
WELL...
OH, NO.
GOOD AFTERNOON,
EVERYBODY.
GREETINGS.
HOW DO YOU DO?
GLAD TO SEE YOU.
WHICH ONE OF YOU GENTLEMEN
IS MR. WITZEL?
I'M VERY GLAD
TO KNOW YOU, SIR.
I EXPECT WE'LL BE SEEING
A GREAT DEAL OF EACH OTHER
IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.
YEAH. LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO YOUR FELLOW PRISONERS.
THE GENTLEMAN IN THE CHAIR IS REVEREND
MR. ROBERTS. HE'S OUR MISSIONARY.
HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?
GOOD.
THIS IS THE DOCTOR.
HE'LL FILL YOU
FULL OF QUININE
ON THE SLIGHTEST
PROVOCATION.
AND THAT'S WILBUR ASHLEY,
THE MAN YOU'RE RELIEVING.
MR. LANGFORD, IT WON'T BE
MANY MONTHS BEFORE YOU REALIZE
JUST WHAT A RELIEF
YOU REALLY ARE.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND ANY
TOO CHEERFUL, DOES IT?
DON'T TAKE NO NOTICE
OF THEM.
THEY'RE ALL SUN-BAKED.
HA HA HA!
GENTLEMEN, ON THIS
AUSPICIOUS OCCASION,
I CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE
OF A TOAST.
HERE'S TO THE MAN
WHO HAS JUST COME OUT...
THANK YOU.
AND HERE'S TO THE MAN
WHO'S GOING BACK.
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.
AND HERE'S
TO THE MAN WHO STAYS.
HEAVEN HELP HIM.
BLASTED HOT TODAY.
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HOURS TO
HEAR YOU SAY THAT, YOU SWINE!
I'LL GO AND CHECK
THAT RUBBER.
COME ON, TED.
AYE, AYE, SIR.
JUST A MINUTE.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.
NOT TAKING
ANY CHANCES.
I MIGHT AS WELL
PICK UP MY SUPPLIES.
BE BACK SHORTLY,
MR. LANGFORD.
I WANT TO HAVE A LONG CHAT
WITH YOU ABOUT THE OLD COUNTRY.
AND I WITH YOU
ABOUT THE NEW ONE.
THE OLD COUNTRY.
AHH.
I'LL BET YOU GET
GREAT HUNTING OUT HERE.
YEAH, GREAT.
MOST OF THE TIME
YOU'LL HUNT FOR A SPOT
THAT'S COOL ENOUGH
TO BREATHE IN.
THEN YOU HUNT THROUGH
ALL THIS TWADDLE
THAT THE HOME OFFICE
SENDS OUT HERE BY THE TON.
ARE, UH...
ARE THE NATIVES FRIENDLY?
OH!
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW,
MR. LANGFORD,
WHETHER THEY BROUGHT OUT
MY MEDICAL SUPPLIES?
NO, I REALLY
COULDN'T SAY, DOCTOR.
OH... SEEMS A SHAME
TO WASTE GOOD WHISKEY
STERILIZING.
I'M MOVING OUT OF HERE,
LANGFORD.
TOO HARD ON THE NERVES FOR
BOTH OF US UNDER THE SAME ROOF.
KEEP OUT OF MY WAY, AND
I'LL KEEP OUT OF YOURS.
DO YOUR WORK, AND DON'T GET
INVOLVED WITH THE NATIVES.
INVOLVED?
NEVER LET THE MEN SEE
YOU'RE AFRAID OF THEM,
AND DON'T
MAMMY-PALAVER.
MAMMY-PALAVER?
TALK TO THEIR WOMEN,
GIVE THEM TRINKETS.
WOMEN?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
AS IF I'D BE INTERESTED.
YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING
THAT I MIGHT-
I'M NOT SUGGESTING
THAT YOU MIGHT.
I'M PROPHESYING
THAT YOU WILL.
THE COLLEGE OF SURGEONS,
IN MY DAY,
WAS A GREAT INSTITUTION.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
QUITE HOW TO TAKE YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU'RE RIBBING ME
OR WHETHER YOU'RE BEING
DECIDEDLY UNPLEASANT.
NOTHING PERSONAL.
WE ALL COME OUT HERE
WITH GREAT IDEAS
ON WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO.
IN THE END, WE DO JUST THE
SAME AS THE OTHER FELLA.
JUST A MATTER OF TIME
TILL THE DAMP ROT SETS IN.
DAMP ROT?
YEAH.
SEE THAT PLANK?
LOOKS PRETTY SOLID,
DOESN'T IT?
THERE YOU ARE.
DAMP ROT.
WHAT CAUSES IT?
CLIMATE, MOISTURE.
MEN REACT TO IT
IN ALMOST THE SAME WAY.
THERE'S A PRETTY FAIR EXAMPLE
FOR YOU OVER THERE.
HE USED TO BE A PRETTY GOOD
SURGEON IN HIS DAY.
NOW HE'S LESS
THAN A HORSE DOCTOR.
DAMP ROT.
VERY DAMP WITH HIM.
IT'S GOT ME
IN ANOTHER FORM,
AND IT'LL GET YOU JUST AS
SURE AS YOU'RE SURE IT WON'T.
THAT'S
VERY INTERESTING.
I'LL TELL YOU
HOW IT'LL START.
YOU'LL STOP SHAVING
REGULARLY.
I DOUBT IT.
I KNOW IT.
THEN YOU'LL STAGNATE
AND DETERIORATE,
AND IN THE END...
WELL, JUST REMEMBER WHAT
I TOLD YOU ABOUT TRINKETS.
LOOK, WITZEL, AFRICA'S
GOING TO BE MY HOME
FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS,
AND I INTEND
TO MAKE IT LIVABLE.
NO MAN OR WOMAN COULD MAKE
YOUR PROPHECY COME TRUE.
THAT'S THE FIRST INTELLIGENT
SOUND HE'S MADE TODAY.
LANGFORD!
COME BACK!
NEVER DO THAT.
NEVER PUT YOURSELF
BETWEEN THEM AND THE WATER.
I DIDN'T. I GOT A SHOT OF
HIM JUST AS HE WAS SUBMERGING.
THEY USUALLY SWIM IN PAIRS.
THERE WAS PROBABLY ANOTHER
ONE BEHIND YOU IN THOSE REEDS.
GOOD HEAVENS!
THEY ALWAYS GET AWAY
FROM YOU IF THEY CAN.
THE NATIVES TREAT THEM
WITH CONTEMPT.
BUT I'M NO NATIVE.
BETTER GO BACK
TO THE BUNGALOW.
YOU'RE NOT USED TO THIS.
WHAT'S ALL THAT ABOUT?
THE POLICE BOYS
ARE BRINGING HIM IN.
WITZEL WILL GIVE HIM A FAIR HEARING
AND THEN HAND OUT THE PUNISHMENT.
WHY WITZEL?
HE'S THE RESIDENT
MAGISTRATE.
SOMEONE HAS TO REPRESENT
THE LAW IN THESE PARTS.
WITH ALL HIS FAULTS,
WITZEL IS JUST.
COURT'S IN SESSION.
THE EVIDENCE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE
SHALL BE THE TRUTH,
THE WHOLE TRUTH,
AND NOTHING
BUT THE TRUTH.
POOR DEVIL LOOKS
SCARED TO DEATH.
WHAT'S HE SAYING?
APPARENTLY,
HE'S STOLEN SOMETHING-
A RIFLE...
MY RIFLE!
RECOGNIZE HIM?
ONE OF YOUR CONVERTS,
ISN'T HE?
YES.
YEAH. WELL, I NEVER
KNEW IT TO FAIL.
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR PAMPERING HIM,
GIVING HIM FAIR WAGES
INSTEAD OF THE WHIP,
STAMPING OUT FAMINE
AND LEPROSY,
SWAPPING MEDICAL CENTERS
FOR WITCH DOCTORS,
BIBLES FOR VOODOO.
MAYBE A DOSE OF MY MEDICINE WILL
BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOURS.
SEND HIM BACK
TO SIERRA LEONE.
ONE YEAR.
COURT'S ADJOURNED.
YOU MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO
IMPRISON HIM A WHOLE YEAR
FOR PRACTICALLY NOTHING?
THE RESIDENT HAS THE LEGAL
POWER OF LIFE OR DEATH.
BUT JUST FOR TAKING
A RIFLE?
YES, BUT DIDN'T
YOU UNDERSTAND?
HE SHOT IT
OFF...
AND AT WITZEL.
DON'T SPILL IT!
UNGOWA!
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SPOT
BEFORE WE EAT?
OH, MAYBE I BETTER STAY AND WATCH THIS.
YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.
OH?
WE USUALLY EAT ALONE.
YOU DO?
WITZEL'S ORDERS.
BUT WE ALWAYS CELEBRATE
BEFORE THE BOAT LEAVES.
AHH. HA HA.
NOW, THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A FEED.
NOW, IF WE WAS BACK
IN SIERRA LEONE...
OH...
YOU MEAN MAGGIE.
IT'S BEEN SO LONG,
I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO
TALK TO A CIVILIZED WOMAN.
OH, SHUT UP.
WHO DO YOU THINK WE SEE LAST
TRIP BACK IN SIERRA LEONE?
YOU KNOW, THAT CHOCOLATE CLEOPATRA.
TONDELAYO.
WELL, WHO IS
THIS TONDELAYO?
QUITE AN EYEFUL, IF YOU SHOULD ASK ME.
UP TO HER TRICKS AGAIN
AT THE CONVENT.
YOU SHOULD SEE THE
TRADERS WHAT GOT RELIGION
JUST TO GET AROUND THERE TO
TAKE A SQUINT AT THAT HALF-BREED.
IT'S THE HARDEST FIGHT
WE HAVE.
AS SOON AS WE TEACH A FEW
WOMEN TO COOK AND SEW
AND SPEAK A DOZEN WORDS
OF OUR LANGUAGE,
SOME WHITE TRASH WILL TURN
IT TO HIS OWN ADVANTAGE.
WHY SHOULDN'T HE?
BECAUSE THE END IS
ALWAYS IN THE BEGINNING.
IT'S ALWAYS THE WHITES WHO
BECOME THE MORE DEGRADED.
SHE SENT A MESSAGE
TO YOU, WITZEL.
SAYS ONE DAY SHE'S COMING
BACK TO COOK TIFFIN FOR YOU.
OH?
YOU WOULDN'T DRIVE HER OFF THE
TERRITORY THEN, WOULD YOU, WITZEL?
SHE SHOWS HER NOSE
AROUND HERE,
SHE'LL GET A WHIP
ACROSS HER BACK.
SOUR GRAPES. I'VE SEEN
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT HER.
YOU BLASTED IDIOT.
NOW, GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.
ISN'T IT RIDICULOUS
TO BLAME HER
FOR EVERY WHITE MAN
THAT LOSES HIS BALANCE?
WELL, I LIKE THAT.
DIDN'T YOU ASK ME TO KEEP
HER AWAY FROM YOUR MISSION?
THAT WAS VERY DIFFERENT.
YOU BET
IT WAS DIFFERENT.
THE FAIRY TALES YOU WROTE
ABOUT THAT SAND WALKER.
SHE WAS TO BE
EXHIBIT "A,"
AN EXAMPLE
TO YOUR CONVERTS,
MORE SINNED AGAINST
THAN SINNING.
I STILL BELIEVE THAT.
THE UNDEVELOPED MIND
OF A CHILD
MADE DANGEROUSLY VAIN BY
THE ATTENTIONS OF WHITE MEN.
WELL, CAN'T SAY THAT I BLAME THEM.
WITH ALL HER FAULTS,
SHE HAD AN INNATE MORALITY.
OR SHALL WE CALL IT
SELF-PRESERVATION, PADRE?
CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE. IT'S A
RAY OF LIGHT. IT DESERVES CREDIT.
TONDELAYO PLAYED YOU
FOR A SAP-
TRANSLATED YOUR GOOD WORDS INTO
BUSH DIALECT THAT ALL MIGHT HEAR,
AND THEN,
BEHIND YOUR BACK,
TAUGHT YOUR CONVERTS TO
LIE AND CHEAT AND STEAL.
SHE'S TOO HIGH AND
MIGHTY FOR THE NATIVES,
AND TOO SMART
FOR THE WHITE MAN.
AND FOND OF TRINKETS.
THANKS, WITZEL.
THANKS FOR THE TIP.
DON'T MENTION IT.
OH, CUT THAT OUT.
THAT TUNE
TAKES ME BACK.
TAKES WHO BACK?
TAKES WHO BACK, HUH?
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
ASHLEY, OLD MAN.
TAKES WHO BACK?
TAKES ME BACK.
TAKES ME BACK.
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
TAKES ME BACK HOME.
HOME
SWEET...
OH, PIPE DOWN,
WILL YOU?
SWEET HOME
BE IT EVER SO HUMBLE
THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE HOME
HEY, QUIT THAT STUFF.
HOME
SWEET
SWEET HOME
BE IT EVER SO HUMBLE
THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE HOME
HEY, TED,
GIVE US A DANCE.
YEAH. HOW ABOUT
A BARN DANCE OR A POLKA?
A HORNPIPE!
HORNPIPE!
GOOD WORK!
GOOD WORK!
SAY, DO YOU FELLAS DRINK
THIS MUCH EVERY NIGHT?
UNFORTUNATELY, NO.
FAR TOO MUCH ALCOHOL IS CONSUMED
BY THE MEN OF THIS COAST.
EVEN YOU, DOCTOR,
MUST ADMIT THAT.
IT'S MORE HEALTHFUL
TO BE SOBER,
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE SO PLEASANT.
LANGFORD, I ADVISE YOU
TO TRY AND DO WITHOUT IT.
I DON'T THINK THAT'LL
BE TOO DIFFICULT.
YOU'LL UNTHINK A LOT OF THINGS
BEFORE YOU COME DOWN TO EARTH.
WE'RE ALL SUPERMEN WHEN
WE FIRST COME OUT HERE.
BLASTED HOT TODAY.
IF YOU SAY THAT AGAIN,
YOU SWINE, I'LL BRAIN YOU!
NO, NO, NO. WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT. NO.
THEY'VE LOADED, TED.
SIGNAL 'EM
WE'RE COMING ABOARD.
AYE, AYE, SIR.
NEXT TRIP,
THE DRINKS ARE ON ME.
CHARMED.
SO LONG, PARSON.
GOOD-BYE, SKIPPER.
CHEERIO, WITZEL.
SKIPPER,
JUST A MINUTE.
I HAVE SOMETHING I'D
LIKE YOU TO DO FOR ME.
SHALL WE SEE THEM OFF?
IT'S THE LEAST
WE CAN DO.
COME ON, WITZEL.
ALL RIGHT.
SAY, WHERE'S ASHLEY?
OH, SKIPPER, YOU'VE
FORGOTTEN YOUR PASSENGER.
MIGHT BE A JOKE
TO LEAVE HIM.
HE'D GO BARMY
IF WE DID.
COME ON, TED.
COME ON, MY LAD.
YOU'RE GOING HOME.
HOME.
WE'LL HAVE
TO CARRY HIM ABOARD.
I'VE ALWAYS REGRETTED THAT LIQUOR
NEVER AFFECTED ME LIKE THAT.
WE'LL DEAD-FREIGHT HIM.
YEP.
COME ON.
UP YOU GO.
THERE WE ARE.
A-ROTO-TEE-TOTE
SHE PAYS THE BOAT
IN A VERY CHARMING MANNER
I WOULDN'T DISRUPT
THE EQUILIBRIUM
OF HIS SEMICIRCULAR
CANAL.
IT'S APT TO CAUSE
VERTIGO AND NAUSEA.
WHAT?
IT'LL MAKE HIM SICK.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?
ROTO-TEE-TOTE
SHE PAYS THE BOAT
IN A VERY CHARMING MANNER
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING,
LANGFORD.
YEAH.
HE'S GOING HOME,
AND HE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW IT.
WELL, HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DRINK
HIMSELF INTO THAT CONDITION.
WELL, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
MANY THINGS, MY BOY,
BEFORE YOU'VE BEEN
OUT HERE VERY LONG.
WELL, SIR,
I BID YOU GOOD NIGHT.
DO YOU HAVE TO GO,
DOCTOR?
PERHAPS THERE IS TIME
FOR ONE LITTLE SPOT.
IT'LL BE THREE MONTHS BEFORE
WE HEAR THAT WHISTLE AGAIN, EH?
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
SHE'LL WHISTLE AGAIN
WHEN SHE GETS
AROUND THE BEND.
THE CAPTAIN ALWAYS
SENDS HIS AU REVOIR.
I ALWAYS LISTEN.
IT ALWAYS COMES...
LIKE A DISTANT HANDSHAKE.
YOUR HEALTH, SIR.
AGAIN, SIR,
I BID YOU GOOD NIGHT.
I AM TONDELAYO.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU SENT FOR ME.
IT WASN'T THE HEAT
THAT DROVE ASHLEY CRAZY.
IT WAS TONDELAYO.
THAT'S INTERESTING.
TOO INTERESTING.
YOU'RE OUT HERE
TO WORK.
SHE WAS PICKED UP LEAVING YOUR BUNGALOW.
WHAT WAS SHE DOING
THERE?
CURIOSITY, I GUESS.
UH-HUH.
YOURS OR HERS?
PERHAPS BOTH.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
KICK HER OUT?
I'M NOT USED
TO KICKING PEOPLE,
PARTICULARLY
IF THEY'RE WOMEN.
AND GOOD-LOOKING.
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT?
WHY SHOULDN'T I
TALK TO HER?
SHE'S A LOT MORE CIVILIZED
THAN SOME PEOPLE I KNOW.
YOU SHOULD KNOW.
PENDULLA.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,
BUT DON'T BE SCARED.
WITZEL NO BEAT
TONDELAYO, EH?
OF COURSE HE WON'T.
KEEP OUT OF THIS,
WILL YOU?
THIS YOUNG FOOL
ISN'T ON TO YOUR TRICKS.
YOU'LL GET NO SILKS
AND BANGLES FROM HIM
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO THROW
YOU OUT OF THIS DISTRICT RIGHT NOW,
AND IF YOU SHOW YOUR NOSE
IN HERE AGAIN,
I'LL CUT MY INITIALS
ACROSS YOUR BACK.
DON'T LET HER OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
TILL YOU THROW HER OVER THE BORDER.
DON'T YOU EVER
GIVE ANYBODY A BREAK?
YES. I'M TRYING
TO GIVE YOU ONE.
IT'S A SHAME
TREATING YOU LIKE THIS.
WITZEL
MUCH BIG BOSS.
WITZEL THINKS
HE'S A TIN GOD.
MAYBE ONE DAY
TONDELAYO COME BACK
AND MAKE TIFFIN FOR YOU.
WHY TAKE CHANCES?
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT
WITZEL MIGHT DO TO YOU.
ONE TIME, WITZEL...
HIM LIKE TONDELAYO MUCH.
OH?
WELL, MAYBE
THAT'S THE TROUBLE.
WELL, ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU I WAS SORRY.
HERE. MAYBE YOU CAN USE
THIS MONEY ON THE COAST.
IT'S NO GOOD TO ME HERE.
MUCH SILK
AND MANY BANGLES!
GOOD LUCK.
BLASTED HOT TODAY.
THIS WILL BE YOUR SECTION-
1,200 TREES.
RIGHT. WHAT DO I DO?
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING,
BUT MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO.
THAT WATER HAS
TO BE KEPT RUNNING
TILL THESE SAPLINGS ROOT THEMSELVES
DEEP ENOUGH TO DRAW MOISTURE.
THAT SHOULDN'T
BE DIFFICULT.
YEAH? THAT SUN
EVAPORATES THE WATER
BEFORE THE EARTH
CAN ABSORB IT.
IT'S YOUR JOB TO SEE
THAT IT DOESN'T.
KEEP THESE TREES ALIVE
FOR SIX MONTHS,
THEN THEY'LL
TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.
RIGHT. I'LL INSPECT
THEM EVERY MORNING.
IF YOU DO THAT, THOSE BOYS WILL SPEND THE
REST OF THE DAY SQUATTING IN THE WATER.
NEVER LET THEM KNOW WHEN YOU'RE
COMING. KEEPS THEM ON THEIR TOES.
NEW BOSS.
BAD TEMPER,
STRONG ARM.
YOU WATCH.
HE SPEAKS A FEW WORDS.
HE'LL HELP YOU CATCH ON.
DO I HAVE TO LEARN
HIS LANGUAGE?
YOU'LL WAIT A LONG TIME IF YOU
WAIT FOR HIM TO LEARN YOURS.
I'LL MAKE AN INSPECTION HERE IN
SIX MONTHS AND TABULATE THE TREES.
YOU CAN TAKE OVER NOW.
UH, YOU CAN
GET BACK TO WORK NOW.
HEY, YOU CAN
GET BACK TO WORK NOW.
WELL, GO ON!
BACK TO WORK!
I SAID,
GET BACK TO WORK!
GO ON! GO ON!
GET OVER THERE!
TELL THOSE BOYS
TO HURRY!
GO ON OVER THERE
AND GET TO WORK!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
STOP THAT NOISE.
HA HA HA!
STOP THAT NOISE, I SAY!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
WITZEL.
WITZEL!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
WITZEL!
YES?
DON'T SEND THE CANOE
BACK FOR ME
TILL TIFFIN TIME.
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE
ALL DAY.
THOUGHT I SENT WORD
I WANTED TO SEE YOU.
I WAS VERY GREEN.
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN...
NOW I'M BECOMING
ACCLIMATIZED.
60% OF YOUR TREES
DEAD IN FIVE MONTHS.
YOU'RE EVEN BETTER
THAN ASHLEY.
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS
I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU.
SIT DOWN.
AFRAID I MIGHT SOIL
THESE PRETTY CHAIRS.
WHY DOES IT ANNOY YOU THAT
I DON'T LIVE LIKE A PIG?
YOU DIDN'T COME OUT HERE
TO OPEN A TEA SHOP.
YOU HAVEN'T GOT WHAT IT
TAKES. GO ON BACK HOME.
AND HEAR YOU SAY,
"I TOLD YOU YOU'D QUIT"?
YOU SAY IT EVERY DAY AND
WITH THE SAME INTONATION.
IT'S GETTING
ON MY NERVES.
I'M FED UP WITH YOUR
BLASTED PROPHESIES!
"YOU'LL GO NATIVE.
YOU'LL GO HOME."
THAT'S WHERE
YOU SHOULD GO-HOME.
EVERY NATIVE HERE LAUGHS
AT YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK.
A LOT OF HELP
YOU'VE GIVEN ME!
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM,
A WET NURSE?
I THINK YOU'RE A SWINE.
I TAKE THAT AS A
COMPLIMENT, COMING FROM YOU.
NOW, THEN, IF IT ISN'T
ASKING TOO MUCH,
WOULD YOU MIND MAKING OUT A
REPORT FOR THE HOME OFFICE?
TELL THEM WHAT A NICE, COZY
LITTLE PLACE YOU'VE GOT HERE.
AND DON'T FORGET TO TELL THEM
THAT YOU SHAVE EVERY DAY
AND THAT YOU'VE GOT
THE CUTEST LITTLE BATHTUB.
OH, AND YOU MIGHT MENTION JUST RATHER
CASUALLY AS SORT OF A POSTSCRIPT
THAT YOU KILLED
A FEW ACRES OF TREES.
THEY'LL LIKE THAT.
GET ME A GIN AND LIME.
I SAID, GET ME
A GIN AND LIME!
DON'T PRETEND
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
AND I TOLD YOU FOR DAYS
TO FILL THAT LAMP!
GIN AND LIME.
GIN AND LIME!
GOOD MORNING-
MUST BE VERY IMPORTANT
IF I HAVE TO
GET OUT OF MY TUB.
WITZEL, IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN YOU SEEM TO REALIZE.
WELL, WHERE IS
LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY?
OH, PLEASE.
LANGFORD!
WITZEL WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.
WELL, IT'S
A GREAT PRIVILEGE.
HELP YOURSELF
TO A DRINK, DOCTOR.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GETTING YOURSELF FIXED UP
TO GIVE THE NATIVES A LAUGH,
OR ARE YOU GETTING READY TO GO HOME?
WHEN MY FOUR YEARS ARE UP,
I'LL SIGN FOR ANOTHER STRETCH.
I'LL BE HERE WHEN THEY CARRY
BACK WHAT'S LEFT OF YOU.
POOR BLOODY FOOL.
OH, NOW,
PLEASE, WITZEL.
I ASK YOU, DON'T KEEP
TELLING HIM TO GO HOME.
IT'S BECOME
AN OBSESSION WITH HIM.
AS SOON AS HE BECOMES
ACCLIMATIZED-
DON'T USE THAT WORD
"ACCLIMATIZED"!
I CAN'T STAND IT!
EVERY DAY FOR MONTHS,
I'VE HAD TO LISTEN TO LANGFORD
PHILOSOPHIZING ABOUT BEING ALL RIGHT
AS SOON AS HE GETS
ACCLIMATIZED.
AND FOR THE LOVE OF PITY,
DON'T TELL ME TO TAKE QUININE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE
GOING TO SAY, ISN'T IT?
OR THAT YOU'VE LIVED IN
AFRICA FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS.
I KNOW THAT, TOO. OR THAT I'M
ABOUT DUE FOR ANOTHER ATTACK.
THAT'S WHAT
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY.
I ONLY-
CAN ANYBODY SAY ANYTHING THAT
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A NURSERY RHYME?
DO YOU HAVE TO SHOUT?
ARE WE ALL DEAF?
NO, BUT
YOU'RE ALL DUMB.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
COME HERE, YOU KNOW.
NO, NOT IF I WANT TO DO EVERY
BLASTED BIT OF WORK MYSELF, I DON'T.
THIS ISN'T
A SEASIDE RESORT.
WE'RE OUT HERE
TO WORK.
IT WAS AGREED WHEN YOU CAME
OUT THAT WHAT I SAID, WENT.
EVER SINCE THEN, YOU'VE SAT
BACK AND LET ME DO THE WORK
WHILE YOU WAIT
TO GET ACCLIMATIZED.
YOU GO TO THE DEVIL.
NOW, NOW, MY BOY.
PERHAPS YOU WOULDN'T MIND
DECIPHERING THIS REPORT OF YOURS.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, IT MIGHT
AS WELL BE WRITTEN IN CHINESE.
IF YOU'D SPEND A LITTLE MORE
TIME SHOWING ME WHAT I OUGHT TO DO
AND A LITTLE LESS TIME PROPHESYING
WHAT I WON'T DO, WE MIGHT GET SOMEWHERE.
NOW, NOW, NOW,
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.
IN HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES,
THERE ARE ONLY
FOUR WHITE MEN.
WE ALL HAVE OUR FAULTS, AND
WE GET ON EACH OTHER'S NERVES.
THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS TO
MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR EACH OTHER
AND BE A LITTLE HUMAN.
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
WITZEL?
WELL, MAYBE THERE IS
SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY.
YOU'RE RIGHT, DOCTOR.
SORRY IF I WAS
UNPLEASANT, WITZEL.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
FEELING KIND OF
ROTTEN TODAY.
I KNOW. FORGET IT.
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT AS SOON
AS I GET ACCLIMATIZED.
THERE YOU GO WITH THAT BLASTED
WORD "ACCLIMATIZED" AGAIN!
ISN'T THERE ANOTHER WORD IN THE
ENGLISH LANGUAGE BUT "ACCLIMATIZED"?
ACCLIMATIZED,
ACCLIMATIZED!
YES! THERE'S "GO HOME"
AND "GO NATIVE"!
YEAH. WELL, PERHAPS I'M NOT
SO FAR WRONG ON THAT, EITHER.
I GOT A TIP TONDELAYO'S
BACK IN THE DISTRICT AGAIN.
AT YOUR INVITATION?
YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS!
I'M RESIDENT
OF THIS DISTRICT,
AND IF SHE SETS HER
FOOT IN THIS STATION,
I'LL PUT A WHIP
ACROSS HER BACK
IF I HAVE TO DRAG HER
OUT OF YOUR ARMS TO DO IT.
YOU DIRTY,
ROTTEN-MINDED SWINE!
NO, NO, NO, MY BOY.
SOMEDAY I'LL KILL HIM.
I SWEAR IT!
SOMEDAY I'LL KILL HIM!
NO, NO, YOU MUSTN'T-
LET ME ALONE. YOU GET ON MY
NERVES AS MUCH AS HE DOES.
GET OUT. GET OUT!
IF THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I CAN APPEAL TO YOU,
I MIGHT REMIND YOU
THAT I AM YOUR GUEST.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I APOLOGIZE.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?
IS IT TRUE WHAT WITZEL SAID
ABOUT TONDELAYO BEING BACK?
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
OF COURSE, YOU DO KNOW
JUST WHO AND WHAT SHE IS.
YES, YES, YES.
SHE KNOWS HOW TO PURR
HER WAY INTO YOUR MIND
AND SCRATCH
HER WAY OUT,
ALWAYS TAKING
AND NEVER GIVING.
SHE'S THE NEAREST THING TO
A CIVILIZED WOMAN I'VE SEEN
IN FIVE
IMPOSSIBLE MONTHS.
HOW DO YOU DO,
AWYLA?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
ALL THESE MONTHS?
MISSION AT LAGOS.
ALL PRAY, PRAY,
AND COOK, COOK.
TONDELAYO REMEMBER MUCH
AWYLA.
WHY DO YOU CALL ME
AWYLA?
AWYLA IS IBIO
FOR "MY MAN."
YOU BETTER GET OUT OF THE
DISTRICT BEFORE WITZEL FINDS YOU.
AWYLA AFRAID OF WITZEL?
I DESPISE HIM.
AWYLA TELL WITZEL
TONDELAYO GO WHERE SHE LIKE,
DO WHAT SHE LIKE...
SEE WHO SHE LIKE.
I'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER.
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
NO, NO,
I MEAN THE CHAIR.
NO.
AWYLA MAKE MUSIC
FOR TONDELAYO.
YES?
THESE RECORDS ARE ALL
SCRATCHES AND MAPLE SYRUP.
HERE, LET ME SHOW
YOU HOW WE DO IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AWYLA AWFUL NICE.
YOU BETTER GO NOW.
I MAKE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND.
OH, NO, YOU WON'T.
TONDELAYO
MAKE YOU TIFFIN.
THEN YOU'LL FEEL
CHANGEABLE.
I TOLD YOU
TO CLEAR OUT.
ASHLEY, HIM BAD TEMPER
JUST LIKE YOU.
BUT WHEN I MAKE HIM TIFFIN,
HIM ALWAYS NICE.
LOOK, TONDELAYO-
SOME DAYS I MAKE HIM
TIFFIN 10, 20 TIMES.
HE MUST'VE BEEN
SOME TEA DRINKER.
OH, HE NO DRINK IT ALL.
SOME HE THROW AT ME,
SOME I THROW
BACK AT HIM.
HIM GAVE ME THIS.
COST PLENTY AT LAGOS.
YOU HAVE BOAT
BRING ME MUCH SILK?
YES?
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
WANT WITZEL-BOSS
TO FIND YOU HANGING
AROUND HERE.
HE NO DARE HURT ME.
YOU NO LET HIM.
YOU'RE THE MOST PERSISTENT
LITTLE DEVIL I'VE EVER SEEN.
AWYLA AWFUL NICE.
NOW, LOOK.
YOU'RE AMUSING,
AND I LIKE YOU,
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
HANGING AROUND THIS BUNGALOW.
MAYBE WHEN THE BOAT
COMES IN-
WHAT COLOR SILK
YOU BUY ME?
THERE GOES THAT
CONFOUNDED LAMP AGAIN!
AWYLA, I THINK
I MAKE YOU TIFFIN.
A CUP OF TEA.
YOU THINK THAT CURES
ANYTHING, DON'T YOU?
MAKE ALL WHITE MEN
FEEL MUCH BETTER.
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO FEEL ANY BETTER.
ALL I'M TRYING TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
IS THAT I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.
YOU NO WANT ME HERE?
NO.
WHY?
BECAUSE.
AWYLA...
OH, WHAT'S THE USE?
WHEW!
AAH!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
A SPLINTER!
SPLINTER!
DON'T SCREAM
THE PLACE DOWN.
COME ON,
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.
IS THE FOOT
ALL RIGHT NOW?
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S FINE.
GOOD NIGHT.
AWYLA NO WANT
TO PALAVER?
IT'S TOO HOT.
REALLY, I...
I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
STAY HERE.
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.
I KNOW.
WHO IS YOUR MOTHER?
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER?
MAYBE I GET MUCH
BLUE SILK, HUH?
MAYBE.
LANGFORD.
HEY, DON'T GO IN THERE.
LANGFORD.
WELL, COME RIGHT IN.
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO OPEN MY
SUITCASES OR READ MY MAIL.
I TOLD YOU I WANTED
A TABULATION
OF ALL THOSE NEW TREES
IN THE NORTHEAST SECTOR.
I DON'T WORK AT NIGHT.
YOU DON'T WORK AT ALL.
MAYBE ONE DAY, THEY'LL SEND ME
A MAN WITH GUTS FOR A CHANGE.
YOU BETTER GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT AWAY.
TONDELAYO SCARED
WITZEL SEE HER GO.
I'LL MAKE SURE THAT HE DOESN'T. COME ON.
WAIT A MINUTE.
HE'S GONE.
TONDELAYO MUCH SCARED
WITHOUT AWYLA.
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TAKE YOU.
WHERE DO YOU GO?
UP RIVER.
TRADING POST.
COME ON.
DON'T RATTLE
THOSE BEADS.
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHEW. TAKE IT EASY,
WILL YOU?
IS IT MUCH FARTHER?
UH-UH.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS A TRADING POST
AROUND HERE.
NO TRADING POST.
TONDELAYO
TELL NATIVES
TRADER
CHEAT THEM MUCH.
NATIVES NO TRADE.
HIM GO BACK
TO LAGOS.
HIM BUY TONDELAYO
MANY BANGLES.
HIM MUCH NICE MAN.
YOU CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE
ANY INHIBITIONS, DO YOU?
HUH?
I MEAN,
WHEN YOU WANT A THING,
YOU REALLY GO AFTER IT.
THEY WON'T HURT YOU.
MAYBE TONDELAYO
GO BACK TO LAGOS.
MAYBE TRADER STILL THERE.
TRADER LIKE TONDELAYO MUCH.
HE'D BE A FOOL
IF HE DIDN'T.
AWYLA...
BOAT'S DUE TOMORROW.
I'LL BUY YOU SILKS
AND BANGLES.
YOU COME FOR THEM
IN THE EVENING, HMM?
TONDELAYO NEVER GO
BUNGALOW AGAIN.
TONDELAYO MUCH SCARED
OF WITZEL.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE AFRAID OF HIM.
NO.
BUT I WANT TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.
TONDELAYO WAIT
TILL AWYLA COME TO HER.
WELL...
WHERE WILL I FIND YOU
IN THIS WILDERNESS?
TONDELAYO BE HERE
TOMORROW NIGHT.
AWYLA COME, YES?
WHAT YOU DO IF WITZEL
FIND OUT TONDELAYO BACK?
IF HE LAID
A FINGER ON YOU,
I'D PUT A BULLET
THROUGH HIM.
LEAVE THOSE ALONE.
I WANT TO READ THEM.
I SAID LEAVE THOSE
ALONE. LEAVE THEM ALONE.
BLAST YOU, YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING.
LEAVE THEM ALONE.
FOR HEAVENS SAKES, TELL
THIS NATIVE TO CLEAR OUT.
HE GETS ON MY NERVES SO I WANT TO YELL.
THANKS.
DRIVES ME CRAZY.
I CAN'T MAKE HIM
UNDERSTAND A WORD.
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO GET ONTO THEIR
BEASTLY TRIBAL LANGUAGES.
OH, THEY'LL COME EASY
AFTER A FEW YEARS.
YEARS?
SEEMS I'VE BEEN HERE
A CENTURY ALREADY.
WELL,
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT
WHEN I BECOME
ACCLIMATIZED.
I, UH...
I'M RUNNING
A LITTLE SHORT OF...
GO AHEAD.
OH, THANK YOU.
THAT'S MINE.
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WENT IN FOR JEWELRY.
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME
YOU HADN'T SEEN TONDELAYO
IN TWO MONTHS.
WELL, I HAVEN'T.
SHE DROPPED THIS
THE NIGHT I PLAYED
THE GRAMOPHONE FOR HER.
THAT'S THE OLDEST TRICK
IN THE WORLD.
THE LONGER SHE STAYS AWAY,
THE MORE LONELY YOU GET.
YOUR MIND'S GETTING MORE
LIKE WITZEL'S EVERY DAY.
WHAT IF SHE WERE ONE
OF OUR OWN WOMEN?
WOULD YOU STILL PUT THE
SAME IMPLICATIONS ON IT?
WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT.
TONDELAYO
MEANS NOTHING TO ME.
GLAD TO HEAR THAT,
MY BOY.
EVEN OUT IN THIS COUNTRY,
WE LIVE UP
TO CERTAIN STANDARDS.
I RESENT BEING TOLD WHAT I
CAN DO AND WHAT I CAN'T DO.
WHAT RIGHT'S WITZEL GOT TO
SCARE HER OUT OF THE TERRITORY?
SHE HAS MORE RIGHT HERE
THAN WE HAVE.
I KNOW JUST HOW
YOU FEEL, MY BOY.
I ONLY DROPPED IN
TO WARN YOU.
SHE'S BEEN SEEN
DOWNRIVER.
HOW FAR DOWNRIVER?
I REALLY
COULDN'T SAY.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I'VE LOOKED
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.
DID YOU GO TO LAGOS?
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SEND ME SOME WORD?
WITZEL.
WITZEL, WITZEL! EVERYTHING
OUT HERE IS WITZEL.
DOES HE OWN
ALL OF AFRICA
AND EVERYTHING THAT
LIVES AND BREATHES IN IT?
YOU'RE COMING BACK WITH ME
RIGHT NOW FOR A SHOWDOWN.
TONDELAYO NO WANT WHIP.
AWYLA GO LAGOS?
TAKE TONDELAYO?
AND HEAR WITZEL SAY
I QUIT? I'D DIE FIRST.
BUT I'VE GOT TO
SEE YOU SOMETIMES.
I'VE GONE CRAZY LISTENING TO THE DOCTOR
TELL THE SAME STORIES
OVER AND OVER AGAIN
AND TO WITZEL'S
TIRADES.
YOU'RE
MY ONLY SALVATION.
NO GO RUBBER STATION.
WITZEL WON'T DARE TOUCH YOU. I SWEAR IT.
I GOT YOU
A LOT OF SILKS
AND SOME
COPPER BEADS.
NEXT TRIP, THERE WILL
BE A NEW GRAMOPHONE.
DON'T YOU WANT TO
SEE ME ANYMORE?
IF AWYLA
WERE BIG BOSS RESIDENT,
TONDELAYO BE VERY HAPPY.
TONDELAYO COULD GO
WHERE SHE LIKE...
IF WITZEL WERE...
AFTER TOMORROW, YOU'LL
BE ABLE TO COME AND GO
ANYWHERE YOU LIKE
IN THIS TERRITORY.
AND WITZEL WON'T BE ABLE
TO DO A THING ABOUT IT...
EVER AGAIN.
BUT YOU-
YOU DON'T MEAN IT.
YES.
BUT-
YES, YES, YES.
BUT IT WON'T DO,
I TELL YOU.
I'LL BE THE JUDGE
OF THAT.
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU'LL REGRET ALL YOUR LIFE.
IT'S-
IT'S UNWHOLESOME.
I SUPPOSE
IF I DIDN'T MARRY HER,
IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT.
I'D RATHER DIE THAN GIVE
WITZEL THAT SATISFACTION.
MY BOY,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO MAKE YOU FIGHT.
IT'S A QUIRK THAT'S BECOME AN OBSESSION.
IT'S TAKING AWAY
YOUR REASON.
AH!
IT'S AFFECTING
YOUR MIND.
THANKS. I LIKE
TO BE TOLD TO MY FACE
THAT I'M A DRIVELING IDIOT.
OH, PLEASE,
LISTEN, MY BOY.
GO HOME.
I'M BEGGING YOU AS
I WOULD MY OWN SON
IF I HAD ONE.
GO HOME.
AND HEAR WITZEL SAY,
"I TOLD YOU YOU'D QUIT?"
THERE GOES
THE OBSESSION AGAIN.
WITZEL! WITZEL! WITZEL!
I SEEM TO BE THE TOPIC
OF THIS CONVERSATION.
WITZEL, I NEED YOUR HELP.
LANGFORD NEEDS YOUR HELP.
LET'S FOR THE MOMENT
FORGET ALL OUR DIFFERENCES.
LANGFORD HAS DECIDED
TO MARRY TONDELAYO.
DID YOU SAY MARRY?
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T
PROPHESY, ISN'T IT, WITZEL?
LOOK, HERE,
LANGFORD...
I'VE NEVER BEEN
VERY STRONG FOR YOU,
BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE.
WHEN I WANT YOUR ADVICE,
I'LL ASK FOR IT.
IF YOU MARRY
THIS WOMAN,
YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH A HELL
NO MAN CAN
STAND UP AGAINST.
YOU'RE
SO BADLY LICKED
THERE ISN'T A MAN
ANYWHERE ALONG THIS COAST
NO MATTER HOW FAR
DOWN HE'S GONE
WHO WOULDN'T RATHER
SEE YOU DEAD.
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANY OF YOU THINK.
TONDELAYO'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS TO ME NOW.
THAT'S DAMP ROT.
WITZEL, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
PLEASURE YOU'RE GIVING ME.
I WOULDN'T MISS
THE SATISFACTION
OF STICKING MY FOOT THROUGH
ONE OF YOUR PROPHECIES
FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.
BUT DON'T BE
A BLASTED FOOL!
WHY MARRY A WOMAN
LIKE TONDELAYO?
SHE'D RATHER
YOU GAVE HER
A TRUMPERY PIECE
OF JEWELRY ANY DAY.
AND IF YOU DO
MARRY HER,
YOU'RE A BIGGER FOOL
THAN EVEN I THINK YOU ARE.
GOT YOUR MESSAGE URGING ME
TO COME QUICKLY.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ILL.
HE'S NOT ILL.
HE'S STARK, STARING MAD.
WANTS YOU TO MARRY HIM
TO TONDELAYO.
YES, YOU'D BETTER
TALK TO HIM, PADRE.
HE WON'T LISTEN TO US.
NO.
I TELL YOU AS A MAN-
AS A MAN WHO'S LIVED
IN THE TROPICS FOR 20 YEARS.
SURELY
YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME
TO MARRY YOU
TO THIS WOMAN.
NO, NO. I'M JUST DOING THIS
FOR A LITTLE AMUSEMENT.
OF COURSE
I WANT TO MARRY HER.
WHAT'S MORE, I'M GOING TO.
THEN YOU WILL HAVE
TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE
TO PERFORM
THE CEREMONY.
SO THE DAMP ROT'S
GOT YOU, TOO.
WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU
TO REFUSE?
I TELL YOU
I LOVE THIS WOMAN.
I CAN'T AND WON'T LIVE
HERE ALONE ANY LONGER.
BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES-
CIRCUMSTANCES
BE HANGED!
WOULD YOU HAVE
REFUSED TO MARRY US
WHEN YOU FIRST
CAME OUT HERE?
NO. YOU'D HAVE SAID SHE
WAS ONE OF GOD'S CREATURES.
WELL, SHE ISN'T
ANY DIFFERENT NOW.
IT'S YOU
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
PLEASE REMEMBER
YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF.
IS THE POWER VESTED IN YOU TO MARRY US?
YES, BUT I FEEL-
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
WHAT YOU FEEL!
DO YOU REFUSE?
WELL, I FEEL THAT BEFORE
YOU DO A THING OF THIS KIND,
YOU SHOULD GIVE IT
EVERY CONSIDER-
DO YOU REFUSE?
IF YOU'VE ANY GUTS IN YOU
AT ALL, ROBERTS, REFUSE!
ALL MY INSTINCTS
URGE ME TO,
BUT MY CALLING
COMPELS ME TO COMPLY
WITH THE PRECEPTS
OF MY FAITH
AND JOIN THEM
IN HOLY MATRIMONY,
IF LANGFORD INSISTS.
THANKS.
TONDELAYO.
JUST A MINUTE!
I'VE HEARD
ALL I WANT FROM YOU.
YOU'RE GOING TO
HEAR PLENTY MORE.
TONDELAYO.
YES, AWYLA.
YOU WANT TO STAY HERE
WITH ME, DON'T YOU?
NOT JUST FOR A MONTH,
BUT ALWAYS.
AWYLA GIVE ME MUCH SILK
AND MANY BANGLES.
YOU SEE? SHE DOESN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.
YOU UNDERSTAND
ALL RIGHT, DON'T YOU?
NOW...
SURE.
AWYLA BUY ME MANY THINGS.
NO BEAT ME MUCH,
AND TONDELAYO STAY
LONG TIME.
EVERYONE CALL ME
MRS. LANGFORD.
MRS. LANGFORD.
TONDELAYO FEEL VERY HAPPY.
MRS. LANGFORD
MAKE YOU TIFFIN.
MRS. LANGFORD
GIVE DOCTOR WHISKEY.
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NO, NO. I...
WITZEL,
HIM TAKE GIN AND LIME.
GET OUT OF HERE!
GET OUT!
NOW YOU GET OUT.
I'LL GO WHEN I GET THROUGH
WITH YOU, AND NOT BEFORE.
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR
WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAY
IF I HAVE TO HOLD YOU
DOWN AND CHOKE IT INTO YOU.
YOU CAN'T PRETEND THAT A FEW
WORDS FROM THE PADRE THERE
CAN SANCTIFY THIS THING,
YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T.
AND YOU, PADRE, YOU KNOW
BLASTED WELL THEY CAN'T.
I HAVE NO CHOICE,
WITZEL.
MY DUTY COMPELS ME
TO COMPLY.
DUTY? HAVEN'T YOU FORGOTTEN
THE MEANING OF THE WORD?
WHERE'S YOUR COMMUNION OF
THOUGHT? YOUR OWN WORDS, PADRE.
IF YOU WERE
BACK HOME NOW,
WOULD YOU MARRY
THAT WOMAN
TO THIS POOR,
HALF-DEMENTED FOOL?
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT. THINGS
OUT HERE ARE SO DIFFERENT.
YOU MEAN
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.
IF YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE
MARRIAGE SACRAMENT IS SO WARPED
AS TO ALLOW YOU
TO PERFORM THIS FARCE,
THEN YOU SHOULD BE
UNFROCKED.
YOU'RE GOING
TOO FAR, WITZEL.
I HAVE
NO LEGAL RIGHT
TO REFUSE
THIS MARRIAGE,
BECAUSE TONDELAYO IS NOT OF ACCRA BLOOD.
ARE YOU CRAZY, TOO?
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID?
SHE'LL TELL YOU HERSELF
THAT SHE'S HALF-ACCRA.
I'M TELLING YOU HER FATHER WAS EGYPTIAN,
HER MOTHER
A LOW-CASTE ARAB.
BOTH DIED AT THE HANDS
OF WANDERING ACCRAS
WHO ALLOWED THE CHILD TO SURVIVE.
I HAVE UNDENIABLE PROOF AT THE MISSION.
WHY HAVE YOU KEPT THIS
TO YOURSELF?
AFRAID OF THE EFFECT
IT MIGHT HAVE ON HIS CONVERTS, I'LL BET.
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
MY CONSCIENCE TOLD ME.
TONDELAYO COULD ONLY
MEAN ANOTHER EXAMPLE
OF OUR FAILURE.
ANOTHER OF YOUR PROPHECIES
GONE UP IN SMOKE, WITZEL.
GET THAT!
I'M MARRYING ONE OF US.
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?
I'M NOT ARGUING
ABOUT GEOGRAPHY.
IT'S WHAT SHE IS
THAT COUNTS.
LOOK HERE, LANGFORD, YOU MAY
THINK I'VE BEEN TOUGH ON YOU.
ALL RIGHT, I HAVE.
MAYBE SOMETIMES I'VE
EVEN BEEN UNFAIR,
BUT IT WAS ALL FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD, LANGFORD,
BECAUSE I SAW WHEN
YOU FIRST CAME OUT HERE
THAT YOU WERE NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS JOB.
AND I WAS IN HOPES THAT
YOU'D QUIT AND GO ON BACK HOME
BEFORE IT WAS
TOO LATE.
FOR 7 YEARS,
I'VE WATCHED
A TRIBE OF YOU
FELLAS COME AND GO,
BUT BY THE SAINTS, I'VE
NEVER RUN INTO ANYBODY
AS PIGHEADED
AS YOU ARE.
YOU'RE ONLY MAKING
IT WORSE, WITZEL.
KEEP OUT OF THIS, YOU
OLD FOOL. KEEP OUT.
YOU WANT TO SEE THIS POOR
WRECK COMPLETELY DESTROYED
BY A CEREMONY THAT CAN'T
BE ANYTHING BUT A MOCKERY?
YOU'RE JEALOUS,
WITZEL!
JEALOUS,
YOU POOR FOOL?
DO YOU THINK IF I WANTED TO DECORATE HER
IN A LOT OF CHEAP JEWELRY
SHE WOULDN'T COME TO ME?
SHE'D
COME RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO
WHEN YOUR TIME IS UP
AND YOU GO ON BACK HOME?
WILL YOU TAKE THAT CONNIVING
SCUM OF THE WEST COAST
BACK WITH YOU THEN?
NO, YOU BET
YOUR LIFE YOU WON'T,
AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHY YOU WON'T.
BECAUSE EVEN IF
YOU HAD THE GUTS TO,
SHE'D WALK OUT
ON YOU
FOR THE FIRST PIECE
OF TRUMPERY JEWELRY
THAT WAS DANGLED IN FRONT OF HER EYES.
TRY IT, WITZEL.
JUST TRY IT.
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE
DOING THIS TO SPITE ME,
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE
BEATING MY PROPHECY,
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER
GUESS COMING,
BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID YOU'D DO,
ONLY YOU'RE CALLING IT BY ANOTHER NAME.
YOU'RE JEALOUS, WITZEL...
AND YOU'RE A SWINE.
CALL IT MARRIAGE! CALL
IT WHATEVER YOU LIKE!
IT'S STILL PLAIN
MAMMY-PALAVER!
AND YOU, PADRE, TRICK
IT UP WITH A FEW WORDS,
HOLY OR UNHOLY, IT'S
STILL MAMMY-PALAVER!
VOWS OR NO VOWS,
YOU CAN'T SANCTIFY IT!
IT'S JUST MAMMY-PALAVER!
GET THAT INTO YOUR SKULL,
LANGFORD. IT'S MAMMY-PALAVER!
MAMMY-PALAVER!
WITZEL,
GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF.
FOR WHAT,
FOR HEAVENS SAKES!
TONDELAYO.
WHAT YOU DO WITH HIM?
DID YOU HEAR WHAT THE
MISSIONARY SAID ABOUT YOU?
LOOK. FUNNY.
I WANT TO EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU
THAT'LL MAKE YOU
VERY PROUD.
HIM MAKE BIG FACE
THIS SIDE...
HIM MAKE LITTLE FACE
THIS SIDE.
NEVER MIND THAT NOW.
IT'S IMPORTANT WHAT
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.
WHY YOU NO WEAR THIS?
MUCH PRETTY.
WHEN THE MISSIONARY
COMES BACK TO MARRY US,
HE'LL EXPLAIN A LOT
OF THINGS TO YOU-
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS,
WHO THEY WERE.
SURE.
FROM NOW ON, YOU'LL BE
TREATED AS YOU DESERVE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT?
I THINK AWYLA AWFUL NICE.
LOOK.
YEAH.
FOR HEAVEN SAKES,
TURN THAT THING OFF.
I'VE READ THE SAME
SENTENCE OVER 20 TIMES.
TONDELAYO LIKE MUSIC.
DO YOU HAVE TO
PLAY THE SAME THING
OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AGAIN?
PRETTY, HUH?
MMM.
MAYBE YOU BUY ME GOLD ONES
WHEN YOU TAKE ME
TO DUELLA.
DON'T YOU EVER THINK
OF ANYTHING BUT JEWELRY?
YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH JUNK
NOW TO OPEN A SHOP.
JUST THE SAME,
YOU SAY YOU BUY ME
MUCH SILK AND MANY BANGLES.
WELL, HAVEN'T I?
SURE...
BUT TONDELAYO WANT MORE.
TONDELAYO
ALWAYS WANTS MORE.
TONDELAYO
MUST BE VERY PROUD.
SHE IS MRS. LANGFORD.
SHE MUST HAVE MORE THINGS
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.
ASHLEY...
HIM GIVE ME EVERYTHING,
AND I NO HAVE TO MARRY HIM.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
I'LL BUY YOU
ANYTHING YOU LIKE!
FOR HEAVENS SAKES,
DON'T MAKE ME ARGUE
ON A NIGHT
LIKE THIS.
I GET YOU GIN AND LIME.
NO.
AWYLA MAKE ME SICK.
ALWAYS IT IS TOO HOT.
ALL TIME WE DO NOTHING.
AWYLA JUST SIT AND SIT AND
NOT GIVE HANG ABOUT ANYTHING!
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO, SING AND DANCE?
BE A CLOWN?
I MARRIED TO YOU
FOR 5 MONTHS,
AND YOU NOT BEAT ME ONCE.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
AWYLA, PLEASE BEAT ME,
THEN MAYBE YOU FEEL
MUCH BETTER.
SOON WE MAKE UP.
MUCH LOVE.
MANY BANGLES.
LOOK, IN A FEW WEEKS,
THE QUEEN WILL BE IN.
I'VE ORDERED YOU
A LOT OF SILKS
AND A PARASOL
AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT.
MAYBE THEY'LL AMUSE YOU
FOR A FEW DAYS.
SOON I'LL SEND YOU
TO THE SISTERS AT LAGOS.
THE SISTERS AT LAGOS
MAKE ME SICK.
I AM MRS. LANGFORD.
THEY CANNOT MAKE ME COOK
AND PRAY ANYMORE.
WHEN THE DOCTOR COMES,
TELL HIM I'LL BE BACK.
I MUCH RATHER WITZEL COME.
WHY WE NO MAKE TIFFIN
FOR HIM SOMETIME?
WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST
IN WITZEL?
HIM MUCH LONELY.
HIM WATCH TONDELAYO PLENTY.
OH, HE DOES?
HIM ALWAYS NEAR RIVER
WHEN TONDELAYO SWIM.
YOU KEEP AWAY
FROM WITZEL.
HE WANTS NO PART
OF US,
AND WE WANT
NO PART OF HIM.
MRS. LANGFORD.
MRS. LANGFORD.
JIM FISH!
PICK UP!
MRS. LANGFORD
DOES NOT ACCRA PALAVER.
PICK UP!
PICK UP! PICK UP!
MUCH QUICK!
PICK UP!
PICK UP, OR
I HAVE YOU WHIPPED!
CAREFUL.
MUCH CAREFUL.
AAH!
WELL, WELL,
BLESS MY SOUL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT WHIP?
TONDELAYO SCARE MUCH
DEVIL OUT OF NATIVE.
YEAH.
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?
HIM OUT.
HIM ALWAYS OUT.
HIM SAY NOT
COME BACK TILL LATE.
I TOLD HIM
I WAS COMING OVER.
SURE.
HIM SAY TOO HOT
TO PALAVER WITH YOU.
REALLY? I HOPE
HE'S NOT SICK.
AWYLA ALWAYS SICK.
IF HE STAY SICK,
TONDELAYO GO AWAY.
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU'RE MARRIED.
SURE.
I'M MRS. LANGFORD.
WELL, I DON'T MEAN THAT.
IT'S NOT THE NAME.
IT'S THE MEANING
OF MARRIAGE THAT COUNTS.
OH... ALWAYS
THEY COME DOWN.
DAMP ROT.
THIS TIME WE'LL
LEAVE IT DOWN.
WELL, IF HE'S NOT
COMING BACK,
I'LL RUN ALONG.
HELLO, LANGFORD.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
COMING OVER.
TONDELAYO SAID YOU WERE
TOO HOT TO TALK.
UNFORTUNATELY, TONDELAYO
STILL LIES ON PRINCIPLE.
SHE HASN'T YET LEARNED
TO TELL THE TRUTH
WHERE A LIE WILL DO
JUST AS WELL.
WITH LOTS OF PATIENCE,
MY BOY,
YOU'LL TEACH HER.
EVERY TIME I GO DOWN
THAT RIVER,
I SWEAR I'LL NEVER
COME BACK.
THEN I SEE THAT LEER
ON WITZEL'S FACE,
AND BY THE TIME
THE SUN'S GONE DOWN,
THERE'S ONLY ONE THOUGHT
BEATING IN MY MIND,
"TONDELAYO.
TONDELAYO."
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
NOTHING.
TAKE IT AND GET OUT THEN.
WHY YOU NO EVER
COME SEE AWYLA?
WHY YOU NO EVER
COME SEE ME?
FOR THE SAME REASON
I DON'T TREAD ON SNAKES.
ONE TIME TONDELAYO THINK
YOU LIKE HER MUCH.
ASHLEY,
HIM THOUGHT SO, TOO.
YEAH.
YOU MADE SURE OF THAT
ALL RIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?
ONE TIME TONDELAYO THINK
SHE LIKE TO MAKE
TIFFIN FOR YOU.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
LET YOU.
THAT MIGHT HAVE SAVED A LOT OF TROUBLE.
TONDELAYO KNOW.
WITZEL MUCH LONELY.
TONDELAYO LIKE WITZEL MUCH.
GET OUT OF HERE
AND STAY OUT.
YOU NO LIKE AWYLA.
AWYLA NO LIKE YOU.
WHY YOU NO SEND HIM BACK ON BIG SHIP?
I WOULD IF I THOUGHT
HE'D TAKE YOU WITH HIM.
MAYBE TONDELAYO STAY
AND MAKE TIFFIN FOR YOU.
OH, SO YOU'RE FED UP
WITH HIM, ARE YOU?
AWYLA SPEAK
TO TONDELAYO
AS IF SHE WERE ACCRA
WOMAN WITH NO SPIRIT.
TONDELAYO NO NATIVE.
TONDELAYO
MRS. LANGFORD.
TONDELAYO WISH PLENTY MUCH SHE WASN'T.
YOU'RE STUCK WITH THAT POOR SAP,
AND YOU CAN'T WIGGLE OUT OF IT.
POETIC JUSTICE.
TONDELAYO
MUST ALWAYS STAY
NO MATTER
WHAT SHE WANTS?
NO MATTER
WHAT SHE WANTS.
IT ISN'T A MATTER OF
SILKS AND BANGLES ANYMORE.
NOW YOU'RE MARRIED, AND THERE ISN'T
A MAN ANYWHERE ALONG THIS COAST
WHO'LL EVER
GIVE YOU A TUMBLE.
REMEMBER WHAT THE PADRE
SAID AT THE CEREMONY?
HIM TALK
ALL THE TIME.
"I JOIN YOU TWO
IN HOLY MATRIMONY
TILL DEATH DO YOU PART."
THAT MEANS
THAT YOU'RE HIS PROPERTY
FOR AS LONG AS HE LIVES.
MAYBE AWYLA SEND ME
AWAY SOMEDAY.
OH, NO. IT'S THE SAME LAW
FOR BOTH OF YOU.
NOW GET OUT OF HERE
AND STAY OUT THIS TIME.
AAH!
NOW WHAT'S WRONG?
SPLINTER! SPLINTER!
TAKE OUT.
LET ME SEE IT.
WITZEL AWFUL NICE.
YOU CONNIVING LITTLE CHEAT.
I GAVE YOU A CHANCE
TO GET OUT OF HERE.
NOW I'M GOING TO
THROW YOU OUT.
COME ON!
NO! NO!
TONDELAYO!
LET ME GO!
LET ME GO!
LET ME GO!
AWYLA!
WE'RE GOING TO
FINISH THIS RIGHT NOW.
GET AWAY,
YOU BLASTED FOOL!
YOU...
MAYBE THAT WILL
HELP YOU ACCLIMATIZE.
HI.
I THINK HIM
MUCH BETTER.
HERE. HERE.
HERE'S SOME NEW MEDICINE.
JUST GIVE HIM A DOSE
EVERY 3 HOURS.
I'LL BE BACK.
NO.
I DON'T WANT
ANY MORE.
DOCTOR SAY
YOU MUST TAKE.
QUININE GOOD
FOR FEVER.
WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING AND DO IT QUICK.
I WANT TO THANK YOU.
THE DOCTOR HAS TOLD ME WHAT
A GOOD NURSE YOU'VE BEEN.
GET ME SOME QUININE.
AWYLA NO DIE, HEY?
BUT IF AWYLA DIE,
TONDELAYO HAVE
NO PLACE TO GO.
THAT'S TOO BAD.
MAYBE ONE DAY
I MAKE TIFFIN FOR YOU, EH?
I'M AFRAID HE'S
A VERY SICK MAN.
DELIRIOUS.
MUTTERING ABOUT
QUININE BURNS HIS THROAT.
QUININE BURNS?
THAT'S FUNNY.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A FEVER
TAKING THIS FORM BEFORE.
I'LL TAKE
A LOOK AT HIM.
BE VERY CAREFUL, WITZEL,
DON'T IRRITATE HIM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I AM, A RASH?
FRANKLY, I'M STUMPED.
IT CAME ON
SO SUDDENLY,
AND IT'S GROWING
WORSE ALL THE TIME.
DOCTOR! DOCTOR!
WHAT IS IT?
WHY IS HIS TONGUE
DISCOLORED LIKE THAT?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU DO KNOW?
THAT'S ONLY
JUST SHOWN UP.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIS TONGUE?
IT HAS A BLACK
COATING ON IT
THAT'S MOST UNUSUAL.
MOST UNUSUAL.
BY THE SAINTS.
COME HERE.
WHAT A LOT
OF FOOLS WE ARE.
IT'S AS PLAIN
AS DAYLIGHT.
HE'S BEING POISONED
BY TONDELAYO.
AND I PUT THE IDEA
INTO HER HEAD.
TOLD HER SHE'D HAVE
TO STAY WITH HIM
TILL DEATH
DO THEM PART.
I'LL STAKE MY LIFE
THAT SHE'S GIVING THAT
POOR DEVIL HIS TICKET.
IF THE BOAT WOULD ONLY
COME WITH MY SUPPLIES.
I'M HOT.
I'M SO HOT.
LANGFORD, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING UP?
PUT HIM ON THE COUCH.
I'M COLD.
GET SOME BLANKETS.
I'M COLD.
GET ME MY BAG.
I NEED SOME MORPHINE.
NO, IT'S NOT IN THERE.
IT'S IN MY PLACE
OR WITZEL'S.
I FORGET WHICH.
NOW, IT'S ALL RIGHT,
MY BOY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THE BOAT WILL
BE HERE SOON.
WE'RE GOING
TO SEND YOU HOME.
HOME.
WELL?
WELL, THAT'S-THAT'S
BETTER THAN MORPHINE.
IT'S SORT OF A COMA.
THERE'S THE BOAT.
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
FOR A FEW MINUTES.
I'LL GET
MY MEDICINES.
I'M STAYING WITH HIM. I'M
NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.
NOBODY'D DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
WELL, I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.
POOR DEVIL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU
GIVING HIM?
QUININE.
DOCTOR SAY
GIVE HIM MUCH.
DID HE SAY TO GIVE HIM A BOTTLEFUL?
DID HE SAY
A BOTTLEFUL?
I NO GIVE HIM
BOTTLEFUL.
SEE?
LET ME LOOK AT IT.
I SAID LET ME
LOOK AT IT.
THIS ISN'T QUININE.
NO?
NO. WHERE'D
YOU GET IT?
DOCTOR MAKE IT.
HIM SAY AWYLA
MUST TAKE IT.
DOCTOR, HUH?
WELL, IF THE DOCTOR
SAID SO,
YOU BETTER
GIVE IT TO HIM.
UGH!
KEEP YOUR HANDS DOWN OR
I'LL CHOKE THE LIFE OUT YOU.
NOW WHAT'S
IN THIS BOTTLE?
MEDICINE.
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?
DOCTOR!
YOU'RE LYING!
NO! MEDICINE!
STOP SICKNESS.
STOP SICKNESS, EH?
ALL RIGHT,
THEN YOU TAKE IT.
NO! NO!
NOW I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I THINK IT IS.
IT'S THE JUICE
FROM THE JUNA.
AND IF IT IS, YOU'RE
TRYING TO POISON HIM.
INSTEAD OF WHICH,
YOU'LL POISON YOURSELF.
NO. NOT JUNA.
MEDICINE.
ALL RIGHT,
THEN IF IT'S MEDICINE,
IT WON'T DO YOU
ANY HARM TO TAKE IT.
AS RESIDENT OF THIS DISTRICT,
THAT'S THE COURT'S ORDER.
OPEN YOUR GULLET.
COME ON HERE!
NO! POISON!
POISON!
NO!
NO! NO!
AAH!
I'LL MAKE CALIBAR
THE FIRST STOP.
A NEW MAN'S ARRIVED,
WITZEL.
HE'S SUPERINTENDING
HIS LUGGAGE.
I IMAGINE HE'S A VERY
CHARMING FELLOW.
YOU ALWAYS
IMAGINE THAT.
WE'LL START LOADING.
NEVER MIND THE CONSIGNMENTS, SKIPPER.
I'LL TAKE
THAT RESPONSIBILITY.
WHAT, NO CARGO?
YES.
WHITE CARGO.
GET HIM
ON BOARD.
EASY, YOU BLIGHTERS,
AND DON'T SHAKE HIM
TOO MUCH NOW.
COME ON DOC, YOU AND THE
SICK MAN CAN HAVE MY CABIN.
SO LONG, WITZEL.
GOOD LUCK,
SKIPPER.
YOU'RE, UH,
COMING BACK, DOCTOR?
YES, I'LL BE BACK.
WELL, GOOD LUCK
TO BOTH OF YOU.
I'VE BEEN WITH YOU
FOR NEARLY 3 YEARS.
I THINK I'M JUST
BEGINNING TO KNOW YOU.
WE'RE GETTING QUITE
SENTIMENTAL, AREN'T WE?
NO. WE'RE GETTING
QUITE HUMAN.
I SAY, I THINK
I'M LOST, DOCTOR.
UH...
THEY DIRECTED ME WHERE
I COULD FIND MR. WITZEL,
BUT NOBODY SEEMED
TO BE THERE.
BLACK FELLOW DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
A BEASTLY THING I SAID.
THIS IS MR. WITZEL.
MAY I PRESENT
MR. WORTHING?
I'M TREMENDOUSLY GLAD
TO KNOW YOU, SIR.
I'M SORRY THAT I WON'T BE ABLE
TO SHOW YOU AROUND, MR. WORTHING,
BUT MY PROFESSIONAL DUTIES
CALL ME ELSEWHERE.
HOWEVER, YOU'LL FIND
MR. WITZEL
A VERY CHARMING MAN...
WHEN YOU GET
TO KNOW HIM.
VERY CHARMING INDEED.
FUNNY-LOOKING PLACE,
ISN'T IT?
YEAH, VERY FUNNY.
GREAT HUNTING, I'LL BET.
YEAH. GREAT.
ARE THE NATIVES FRIENDLY?
YOU KNOW, MR. WITZEL, I'M GOING
TO IMPROVE THINGS OUT HERE.
THAT IS, WHEN I
BECOME ACCLIMATIZED.
WHEN YOU BECOME
ACCLIMATIZED!
BY THE SAINTS, THAT'S
WHAT I'LL MAKE YOU DO.
ACCLIMATIZE!
THERE'S A JOB
TO BE DONE HERE,
AND YOU MIGHT JUST AS
WELL BE THE ONE TO DO IT.
I'LL LISTEN TO
YOUR NONSENSE
AND WET-NURSE YOU WHEN YOU'RE HOMESICK,
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO STICK, MR. WORTHING,
GET THAT
INTO YOUR SKULL!
YOU'RE GOING TO
STICK!
OH, I'LL STICK, SIR,
I SWEAR I WILL!
I'M FED UP WITH YOU SAPS
WHO KEEP COMING AND GOING.
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
ALL YOU'LL KNOW IN THE
NEXT FEW YEARS IS RUBBER.
RUBBER AND MORE
RUBBER,
UNTIL IT COMES OUT OF YOUR
EARS AND GETS INTO YOUR HAIR.
RUBBER,
MR. WORTHING!
RUBBER!
RUBBER! RUBBER!
I'LL STICK, MR. WITZEL.
I'LL STICK. I'LL STICK!
AND I STUCK.
YES, SIR,
YOU BET I STUCK.
AND YOU BECAME
ACCLIMATIZED?
DON'T EVER USE
THAT WORD TO ME!
There you are. One dollar.
Big oil strike in California. Read all about it.
Read all about it for 2 bits.
Big oil strike in California.
There's a plenty big one here, bub.
Yeah, if I could only get me a string...
...of equipment, I got a piece of ground that's a honey.
You got ground? You got ground.
Here, take a look at the core from my lease.
Smell it. Down 800 feet and run out of pipe.
Well, if it's pipe and tools you need, there's Luther Aldrich now.
That tightwad.
Luther Aldrich? Where?
Where is he? Wh...?
Hey, 6 bits, please. Thanks.
Get around the side of me, fella, will you?
- Come on, I'm getting out here.
- Come on, mule.
Hello, Luther, old boy. Well, I haven't seen you since the Kansas boom.
- I don't think I quite...
- We made a lot of money there, didn't we?
- Sand. John Sand? You remember me.
- Sand? I don't think I...
I'm spudding in my first well down here.
I'm going down about 1700 feet...
...so I'll need quite a lot of equipment.
- Oh, equipment?
Yes. Mr. Sand, of course.
Well, come right over here.
What section are you thinking of drilling?
Well, my lease is in a new section about 30 miles south of here.
- Thirty miles. A wildcat, huh?
- Some fellas might call it that.
Casing tools and lumber...
...will cost you about $ 7000 in cash.
- That's fine.
That's fine, fine. We'll just carry that in an open account against my name...
...and then when the well comes in...
- I thought so, another deadbeat.
- These boomtowns reek with larceny.
- I may be down to my last couple bucks...
...but do you think I'd do it if I didn't think there was oil?
You're an oil man, aren't you?
All oil men are crazy.
I've been swindled and hijacked and I'm practically naked.
Mr. Aldrich, there's a million dollars in this.
Now, you know me.
I don't know you.
I don't know why I said I did.
What do people think I am, a good fairy?
Hey, brother. Four bits if you want to cross.
Or take it the hard way.
That's the way I take everything else.
Shorty, do you mind backing up and letting me by?
Yeah, I do mind. Suppose you back up.
And don't call me Shorty.
Shorty or sonny, what difference does it make?
You know, you're liable to get all muddy if you don't put it in reverse.
- Move over, bud.
- I'm wearing Justin Boots with 4-inch heels.
They'll sure make big dents in that little frame of yours.
Stop, or I'll shoot.
Put that six-shooter down.
I'm John McMasters.
I never heard of you.
And I got no time to start now.
Nice shooting, Harmony.
Right above the nose.
Sorry his nose was so close to you, big feller.
What did he do to you? Talk back?
No, nothing personal. Just, he's been around hijacking tools and equipment.
Hijacking? Yeah, that's bad business.
Ain't it awful?
I was just trying to arrest him.
Why can't folks be more law-abiding?
I'll go home and won't sleep good again tonight.
I guess he will.
Hey, what do you...? John.
Hi, Evie. How's my barrel of sweet Spanish crude?
Where you been hiding, honey?
Hey, what happened?
You jump out a window?
You know I wouldn't turn my back on a lady.
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, John.
- You been holding out on me.
- You ain't been around.
She just come over from New Orleans.
Lots of laughs.
Never been away from home.
Hey, 50 bucks. You'll spoil the kid.
You can't spoil baby lamb.
Besides, I got 800 in my poke.
Just brought in a gusher for old man Wilson.
I'm here for laughs and checking out in the morning.
You darn prairie jack.
Where you hopping to now?
I hear they brought in a big wildcat out in California.
Wildcats. Always looking for wildcats.
When you gonna settle down, darling?
What the heck, Evie?
Travel and brag, brag and travel.
Maybe I'll hit oil where there ain't.
Throw a steak on the fire for me, will you, with all the fixings. I'm gonna wash up.
Hey, Whitey.
I'll be back down like a spring breeze.
Don't let those apes steal your peanuts.
They say that with diamonds where I come from.
Yes, sir, Whitey.
A brass band in a bathtub.
Oh, excuse me.
Whip those mules, brother, there's a run on the bank.
Say, listen, fella...
Well, well, it's Shorty again.
A man can get pretty sick of running into a guy like you.
Yeah, you don't wanna get sick, though.
I might have to hold your head, Shorty.
I guess you didn't hear me the first time.
Don't call me Shorty.
Why not, Shorty?
Okay. Why should you and me have an argument?
- One of us might get hurt.
- Yeah, that's right. One of us might.
You wanna use the bowl? I'm through.
Wait a minute, I'll fix it up for you.
- Well, thanks, Shorty.
- There you are. Put a little of that gin in it.
Cut right through that oil.
- Cheaper than water, anyway.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Not bad.
- Quite a roll of scratch you got there.
Wouldn't be as much as 6 or 7 grand, would there?
Supposing it is. You think you're gonna pull a gun out of your rudder?
No, no, no. I just thought you might be interested in spudding in a well...
...run it up to a million.
- Oh, no. Nothing doing, Shorty.
I'm heading west. California.
I like them wild.
I hear a guy might do all right out there.
You don't want them any wilder than this.
Look at this. All unproven, virgin lease.
Thirty miles south of here.
- So you think there's oil there, huh?
- You put up for the rig and the tools...
...and you're in for half. There's oil there.
- How do you know, Shorty?
- You don't get them dealing cards.
- The old bunion, huh?
- You're a driller too, huh?
- That's it.
- Come on, what do you say, fifty-fifty?
- Nope.
I've been planted here too long anyway.
Me for over the Rockies.
Stick around, though, and I'll buy you a drink, just for luck.
Okay, Whitey. Diamonds or doughnuts?
- Hey, wait a minute. Where you going?
- Let go. I pick my own posies, jughead.
- Sit down and eat your steak, John.
- Come on, Whitey, honey...
...throw your little derrick up right here.
And happy days.
- Who's your cheerful friend, John?
- Him? That's Shorty.
- Name is Sand. John Sand.
- Well, John. Two Johns.
We gotta do something about that.
Get all mixed up.
- First I'll find a nice girl for you to talk to.
- If you don't mind, I'll just stick to whiskey.
- I'll bet he's got a girl.
- Maybe he's married.
- Got an Oregon Boot back home, Shorty?
- Who, me? No.
- No, not exactly.
- You mean you got a girl, eh, Shorty?
Sure. And he's on the square and I like him.
That's your name. Square John.
Square John, Big John.
That fixes everything.
Well, blood on the moon.
Whitey, if I was to tell you that I was the Mississippi River...
...at high tide, what would you think, huh?
Hey. We thought this over.
You was with us first.
- She was?
- Yeah.
Well, I didn't...
- Looks like we got company, Shorty.
- You got company.
That's what I thought.
I beat you by four feet, Shorty.
Wait a minute. I got another chance.
- I give you a tie.
- Hey, lke. Ed. Break it up. Break it up.
Say, John, stop it. You're giving the place a bad name.
Shorty, you sure can go.
Here I am thinking you're all gab.
Yeah, he pulled a cutting knife on me.
- Makes you mad.
- Yeah.
Hey, where'd you say that lease of yours was?
- Thirty miles south of here.
- Well, okay, okay.
We'll drive out and take a look at her.
In the morning.
- So you think you got a field here, huh?
- I know it. Take a look.
The bigheaded geologists in town say it's only surface gas, but I say it's oil.
- Shorty, I think we got something here.
- I know we have.
And we're plumb center, right here.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
I think more over by that old skull will hit the peak of the dome.
No, no. Don't be fooled by false jogs.
This pay structure, it's right under here.
You're gonna fool yourself down to salt water if you...
I'm an oil man too, you know. I haven't been drilling all my life for gophers.
Wait, I was pulling oil out of the ground when your ma was giving it to you...
...for your health.
- If you think...
- All right, all right, take it easy.
Somebody's gotta be the boss.
You got a hard dollar on you?
- Kind of light, ain't it?
- Yeah, it's counterfeit.
- It's the only kind I can hold on to. Call it.
- Heads.
Okay, you're the boss.
We'll spud in by the skull.
Now, listen, Shorty.
My betting on you is just as good as betting on that skull.
- We'll spud in here.
- Okay, boss.
Hey, now, how about that dough?
How much is in that bankroll of yours?
Well, let's see. I had 800 when I went in the joint last night...
- That Whitey, she's all right, isn't she?
- You told me you had 7 grand.
No. You told me, Shorty.
That'll only put up the derrick.
I'm the boss.
Getting the equipment is up to me.
Just put yourself in my hands.
Hey. Wait a minute, John.
You better keep them eyes peeled for hijackers.
I lost two loads last week.
You hired me when I was broke,
Mr. Aldrich. I won't let you down.
I'll look after your merchandise like it was my very own.
Yeah, well, I think we'd better not take any chances. Come on.
Get down off there, Eddie.
Hey, Harmony.
Come away from that cookbook.
Come on.
- Coming a-running.
- Now, look, Mr. Aldrich, I don't need any...
No, no. If any hijackers start anything,
Harmony will take care of them.
Go ahead.
Well, it's the big feller.
I didn't recognize you at first.
Nice day for the race, ain't it?
- What race?
- The human race.
"You add a pinch of salt to taste and serve piping hot...
...to the delight of your family and friends."
- Don't that sound pretty?
- If you're so interested in cooking...
...why do you go around killing people?
I hate shooting folks. I had a fine job cooking over at the Parsons' ranch.
A bunch of horse rustlers popped in, and when the sheriff come...
...he kind of liked the way they was laid out and he deputized me for this here business.
Say, here's a "reskipe" for lemon "meringoo" pie.
I expect that's just plain old lemon pie for foreigners, don't you...?
Danged if I like them big hawks.
All the time killing little turtledoves.
Put them up.
Come on, pull up there.
- No monkey business, now. Climb down.
- Climb down in front of me, son.
But don't worry,
I'll plug him right between the eyes.
No, no, I can't. I'm shaking all over.
- Come on, you guys. Quit stalling.
- Turn the gun loose.
No, don't shoot.
Maybe he'll shoot back.
All right, keep walking now and keep reaching.
Yes, sir.
Get up there.
Please don't say anything to anybody, will you?
I'm not used to guns.
My knees just turn to water.
I nearly passed out, I guess.
Now, just simmer down, big feller.
Think of something else.
Hey. We're getting close.
Try that last stuff.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Now who wanted to spud in by that steer skull?
We'll be reaching for her tail in a few feet.
We sure had a break with Aldrich.
I thought he'd have spotted us by now.
We'll pay Luther back double.
Come on, you wild kitty. Spit.
- Begins to get you about now, don't it?
- Yeah, like sparking around some dame.
I forgot about that gal of yours, Shorty.
Don't worry, she'll be in platinum garters...
Hey. Listen.
Get back. She's coming in now.
- Come on, honey. Come to us, baby.
- Let's cap her in.
No, let her flow.
Let her open up her mouth and holler.
Look out!
Salt water.
The Gulf of Mexico.
Well, at least we can smoke now.
Take it easy, Shorty.
They say you'll get rich if you drill enough holes.
We'd have been all right if we'd spudded in by that skull.
Must be the water from the side structure.
Well, I guess that's that.
You're thinking about that dame, huh?
Hey, what's her name? What's she like?
She's nuts about you, huh?
I wish I could be sure.
She likes me, I guess.
We've known each other quite a piece.
You know, it ain't exactly set yet...
...but I figured if this well came in, why, she'd come out here and we could...
Forget it.
Pick up your chin. We'll spud in over there someday. Somehow.
Who's that coming?
- That's Luther's car. We'd better travel.
- Travel or jail.
They're getting away.
They're getting away.
Hey, hold it.
Okay.
Take it easy,
I'm gonna get me a pigeon.
For heaven's sake, they're escaping.
Come on, you're the sheriff. Do something.
I wonder what they done with my Barbara Fritchie cookbook.
Shut up, you blithering seagull.
Thousands of dollars' worth of equipment lost, and in a dry hole.
If they ever come back here, I'll have them boiled in oil. In their own oil.
They didn't strike any.
Once more won't hurt them. Seven, dice.
There she is.
Seven out of the field and pay the line.
Six-one, babies. Right back at them.
That's it, babies.
- Eleven. Pay the line.
- Ten passes.
I can't lose. I'm knee-deep in clover.
Just for luck, Shorty.
Come on, babies, once more. Oh, yeah.
- Pay the line.
- There you are, sir.
Two thousand.
Watch me double it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
That's enough.
Those dice got snake eyes, you know.
Okay, Shorty.
Shorty here, he's the warden.
That's right, you tell him, Shorty.
Make him take...
- Don't call me Shorty.
- But, Holy Moses, he called you Shorty.
That's all right. That's him, not you.
Here, buy him seven or eight drinks.
Come on, Shorty, let's go.
Hey, where are we going with all this fancy scratch, little man?
Right back to Burkburnett.
And we're gonna spud in that well right by the old steer skull...
...where a fella tried to get me to do it once before. Remember?
Hey, wait a minute, chump.
Do you think Luther is foolish enough to take $2000 for all we owe him?
You just act like I said.
Do as the boss tells you.
Just check over that balance.
It was wrong again yesterday.
- Hi, Luther. Long time no see.
- Well, gentlemen, what can I...?
It's them. It's them.
Do something, quick. Get Harmony.
Wait a minute. Easy.
We're just here on a little business.
Don't stand there trembling like a pen-wiper. What business?
We wanna pay our bill.
Course, if you don't want the money...
You wanna pay me? Well, why didn't you say...? Come in, gentlemen. Sit down.
I was only saying yesterday, I wonder what happened to Mr. Sand and...
Let go of Mr. McMasters, you idiot.
- Well, it's the big feller.
- Hi, Harmony.
- It's all right, Harmony, there's no...
- Here you are, Luther.
- Well.
- Two thousand on account.
Two thousand?
But you owe me $ 7000.
That's for good faith.
We still got our lease.
We'll pay the rest when our new well comes in.
- New well?
- Sure.
You're gonna give us tools and equipment.
I give you what? Harmony, get the sheriff.
I'll give you jail sentences...
Wait a minute, now, take it easy.
All right, he's got us where it hurts.
- We gotta give him a sixteenth of the well.
- What? We'll do no such thing.
Certainly not. I... I... What's that?
A sixteenth?
Well, I... I... No, I run a strictly cash business here.
All right, all right.
Then we'll give you an eighth.
- Give an eighth of a million dollars away?
- A million dollars? Are you...?
You mean 10 million dollars.
We can afford a measly eighth.
- Come on, Luther...
- No, no, no. Over my dead body.
Where do you get off mooching your way in for an eighth, you old cow thief?
- I'm going over to the bank on my own.
- Wait a minute. Wait.
I don't know what to say.
You said enough, trying to let this crook in on a sure thing.
I worked my hands raw to earn that money.
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I might consider an eighth.
But an eighth of what?
What makes you two maniacs think you're gonna find oil this time?
Say, do you think we'd be sticking our necks in a noose...
...if we didn't know there was oil?
Come on.
- No, no, I still think an eighth is...
- Well, all right. All right. I'll do it.
But it's got to be an eighth.
And we'll sign the papers right now.
Harmony goes out with you to see there's no monkey business.
And if you two fellas don't bring in a well this time...
...you go to jail. Both of you.
I'm not gonna... I'm...
For heaven...
I'm stuck again.
Hot groceries.
- Hey, Big John, come and get it.
- Okay. I'm ready for it.
Here she is, boys.
Another Barbara Fritchie special.
Hey, what's that for?
We gotta have a name for the well.
You mind if we call it that?
"Beautiful darling Betsy."
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Okay, Shorty. Say, when are we gonna get a load of this gal?
Maybe you'll see her one day, if the well comes in.
We're due, all right. Take a look at the sand from that last bailing.
What's that? Rabbit again?
Rabbit stew à la "modee."
Shot two nice fat ones this morning.
Couldn't go out and shoot a can of beans for a change, could you?
Let's drive to Eva's for a steak.
- We got 13 or a dozen bucks left.
- No. Rabbit's okay by me.
We're due for a bust. Five weeks of this ain't natural, fella. I got the jumps.
You and Harmony go in. I can make a few more feet of hole before dark.
- Besides, I got some letters to write.
- Oh, okay, okay. Me for town.
You work out your nightlife with water on the side.
But that gal may stand you up, so just don't turn out to be Henry the Hermit.
I'll pick up the groceries and meet you over at Eva's.
- Hey.
- Careful, my dear.
- Let the deacon help you.
- Thank you.
Looks like Aunt Molly's got a new visitor.
Yeah. Kind of looks that way.
But I'm not sure.
You'll like the other place better, dear.
Not a hotel, more like a boarding house.
More homelike for a girl like you, dearie.
We have evening get-togethers, and the nicest Southern cooking.
- You're very kind, but I...
- Ma'am, I'm about to speak a piece.
You're new here, so you don't know
Aunt Molly and the deacon.
Molly's done a little time.
And the deacon...
...well, he can squirm under a water moccasin with a high hat on.
And you, Auntie, keep that knife in your corset.
It might not look nice if I'd have to kick you in the stomach. Now, get.
Well, thank you very much.
You see, where they wanted to take you...
Well, a girl like you might not have liked it.
You mean I'd wake up in a gilded palace and be afraid to go home?
Oh, you were wise, huh?
Well, they were pretty obvious.
You know, the first time I voted...
...my mother broke down and told me all about the big, bad world.
- Thanks anyway.
- You know...
...I still think you need somebody to keep an eye on you.
- This is a pretty rough town.
- Oh, dear.
- What?
- I thought it was Galahad.
Galahad in boots and a Stetson, come to rescue the fair Elaine from the dragons.
- But underneath you're just Modred.
- What do you mean, Modred?
Sir Modred. Of all the knights, he was the wicked one.
I'm very sorry.
She kind of rustled her bustle at you, didn't she?
Modred. Say, what do you know about those guys Modred and Galahad?
Let me see. I know Pete Galahad.
Sheriff over in Whizbang.
No, no. Two different guys.
Could you tell me where I might find
Mr. Jonathan Sand?
He's drilling out in the south section.
About a 30-mile ride.
I could get you a jitney.
Oh, no, not tonight. Thank you.
I'll have supper and go in the morning.
Yes, ma'am.
- Well, I take your order now.
- Let's see. How's the chicken?
Don't order fried chicken, it's three-year-old jackrabbit.
- Saved again from a fate worse than death.
- Come on, Lena...
...tell her John McMasters is just a babe in the woods.
I bring your soup, but don't go in no woods.
Lena's dizzy from dollar tips.
- Are you Big John McMasters?
- Yeah.
You've heard about me, huh?
Well, I certainly have.
Doesn't that surprise you?
I'm pretty well-known in these parts.
I heard about you long before I arrived here.
On the bus, huh?
Yes. That's right. They were saying,
"Big John McMasters...
...there's a fellow to be heard from."
- Really?
Come on, now, stop kidding me into a bear trap.
A lot's going on tonight.
What am I going to call you for the rest of the evening?
The rest of the evening?
Yeah. All I know now is Elaine.
What am I gonna call you when I take you to that rodeo, for instance?
Well, maybe I just better be the Lady Elaine for a while.
I don't wanna give you any surprises.
You look delicate.
Lady Elaine, nothing you could tell me would surprise me.
Wait and see, Sir Modred.
- You want to order?
- Sure. What are you doing here, at that?
Are you one of those lady drummers?
No, I'm much more important than that.
If I like it here, I might open a shop.
- What kind of a shop?
- Lingerie.
- Come again?
- Underwear. Ladies' underwear.
Ladies' underwear?
Well, I don't know. Now, you see...
...the girls in this town... Well, what I mean is there's not much call for...
- You'd better order.
- Yeah.
Now, Lena, my love,
I want a steak, 32 ounce, rare.
Same racket.
Hasn't changed since I was a kid.
Knock down the milk bottles and they give you St. Vitus.
Stop it, you'll wear him out.
Mr. Summers, just a minute.
I want you to meet Lady Elaine.
- And Mrs. Summers.
- How do you do?
Mr. Summers runs the Emporium, the biggest store in town.
Lady Elaine is selling women's underwear.
I want you to buy till it hurts.
Don't pay any attention to him,
Mr. Summers. He's crazy.
Yes, I'm Sir Modred, the wicked knight.
Wicked knight? You're drunk.
Oh, look, it's started.
Ride him, Henry.
Sit still and sing to him.
I guess Henry can't sing.
Why, that's just like sitting in a rocking chair.
All right, folks. Who else will ride the Missouri Angel?
That's a cinch. All you have to do is wrap your legs around him.
All right, go ahead.
Who, me?
Here's your next rider,
Big John McMasters.
Wait a minute. I was just...
Big John McMasters is our next rider.
You see how happy you've made them?
Yes, yes. Sir Modred is stuck.
Here, take the colors of the fair Elaine and wear them bravely in the joust, Sir Modred.
I don't know what she's talking about, but look after her.
She's something pretty special.
- Whoa, mule.
- He's just looking you over.
Yeah.
Sir Modred is up.
Hey, what do you got the balloon for,
Big John? Going up in the air?
- Everybody likes Big John, don't they?
- Yeah. He's high-test, ma'am.
Hey, Big John!
Sir Modred is still up.
Modred is down.
You know, I've never had so much fun in all my life.
What do we do now?
I guess there's not much more you can do in this town.
- Hiya, Big John.
- Oh, hi, Tom. Hi, Ed.
- Well, we'll be seeing you next summer.
- Yeah? Hey, where are you headed?
- Off to Arizona for a little wildcatting.
- Yes, sir.
And when we come back, we'll be driving a Rolls-Royce.
Attaboy. I hope you bring in a cat that'll really howl.
Happy days.
Tom and Ed Murphy.
I hope they get lucky and strike it.
They've been knocking at the gate a long time.
Say, this sounds very gay.
What's in here?
No, you don't wanna go in there.
That's just a dance hall.
A bad dance hall?
Well, no, but it's a place where fellas go on payday...
- Have you been in there?
- Sure, but...
- Well, then, you can take me.
- No, no, it's liable to be kind of rough.
Now, look,
I'm not really Little Red Riding Hood.
I came down here because I wanted to see if... Well, I want to see all the sights.
Now, please.
Well, I'm agin it.
So holler when you've had enough.
Hello, Big John. Whitey was just asking me where... I beg your pardon.
Hi, Hank. Good old Hank.
Well, look at all the pretty girls.
Do you know them?
Yes... That is, I mean, not all of them, but...
- There's the dance floor. Do you dance?
- Look, here's roulette over here.
- Well, I'd rather...
- Did you ever play roulette?
Say, which one is Spanish Eva?
She's home, taking care of the kids.
Hi, lke. Five bucks on 17.
Me too. A quarter. Two bits on 17.
- Sorry, ma'am, but the limit is...
- Just this once, lke.
Hey, where you been, you big bag of sugar?
I've been cooling my lily-white heels for three hours waiting for you.
- Seventeen odd.
- That means we won, doesn't it?
- Yeah.
- Who's that?
- Why...
- You new here?
Yes, I arrived this evening.
She with you?
- Whitey, this is the fair Elaine, Lady Elaine.
- How are you?
Oh, yeah? And I'm Lady Astorbilt.
She's just his sister, kid.
- Give it to her, blondie.
- Come on.
Holler when you've had enough.
Come on.
After that it was just bumming around...
...logging a bit up in Alberta...
...a few years mining here and there, then France.
Now I'm in the oil game for good, I guess.
A woman always gets a chump to blow his own horn, doesn't she?
Not unless she wants to hear it.
I've never been very close-hitched to people.
That is, until I met my partner.
Right down the street there...
Say, isn't that a wonderful moon?
Yeah. That's moon enough for everybody.
- Say, what's this?
- That?
That's just oil being pulled up out of the ground.
Here? But it looks like a church.
Sure, used to be. Look.
When the boom came, the congregation got excited...
...and spudded in a wildcat right under the pulpit.
Now there are churches all over the state spreading happy days and hallelujah...
...right out of these holes.
- And ye shall rise out of the earth.
- Well, why, who's there?
- Why, glory be, it's Big John.
- Hello, Springtime.
You're out late.
I was just finishing my supper.
- How are they pumping?
- Deep and sure, John. Deep and sure.
They'll be pumping long after
I'm spudded in and part of the flow.
- Well, good night to you.
- Good night.
You know, funny guy, Springtime.
Two times a millionaire...
...once in the Pennsylvania field and once in Louisiana.
Hired the top deck of an ocean liner just to go to Paris.
Now he's here in Texas, broke.
But he might hit it again tomorrow.
- He seems happy, though.
- Yeah. It's a funny business.
You get away from it for a while, go on a bust.
Then one night, you try to sleep...
...those darn pumps start pounding in your ears.
I don't know.
Like a heartbeat.
Yeah. Sounds kind of silly, doesn't it?
Nothing is silly in church.
You sure can talk straight to a fella and ball him up at the same time.
I'll have to sic you on my partner.
You'll like Shorty.
Everybody calls him Square John, and he's as square as the Constitution.
But, you know, Elaine, he's been mooning around about some dame.
Keeps writing her letters, won't talk about her, like it was a 20-1 shot.
If I thought that much about a girl, I'd...
But it'd have to be a girl like you.
I'd want her right where
I could take ahold of her and tell her.
Right here, for instance.
I'd like to go back to the hotel.
What's the matter? What's wrong?
If you don't mind, please, it's getting a little chilly.
Yes, it is a little, at that, I guess.
All right, come on.
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.
Well, thank you. It's been awfully nice.
- I'll see you some more, won't I?
- No, I'm afraid not.
I just realized I have to take the bus in the morning.
Hey, wait a minute.
- Is there another guy?
- Yes.
- You love him, huh?
- No, not this...
- Not that way, but...
- Then what are you leaving for?
Because... Goodbye.
Hey.
Come down here.
I make up my mind quick.
I made it up when I first saw you, I guess.
You aren't ever gonna leave.
She drilled herself in.
You're rich, mister.
There's yeast in the buckwheat.
Boy, ain't that a beautiful black cloud?
Let's cap her.
She'll run all over the state.
Boy, listen to her.
She's just a-puffing and a-blowing.
Hey, wait.
Go and dig up Big John and then find Luther.
- Hey, Shorty. What's up? Did she...?
- She blew herself in.
Five thousand barrels is a cinch.
Come on up here.
I'll be right back.
I gotta go down and send a telegram.
Honey, did you hear that?
That was Shorty.
- You married a millionaire.
- John...
...please sit down.
What? What is it? What's the matter?
Please.
I was gonna tell you later, before we went out to the well...
...but I can't put it off any longer.
What is it?
I'm the girl he's been writing to, John.
What?
Betsy.
The beautiful Betsy.
Elizabeth Bartlett, sure.
This is no good.
Why didn't you tell me?
Oh, darling...
...when you came to that table last night, you were so fresh and sure of yourself...
...I thought it would be a surprise and a big joke when you found out.
You see, later, it wasn't a joke anymore.
I tried to leave, knowing what you two meant to each other.
- I would have gone to him, explained.
- No, you wouldn't have, John.
Darling, I was so afraid.
I was afraid I'd lose you.
- But you told him you would marry him.
- No, I didn't.
Oh, no, I haven't been that unfair.
Listen, I've known Jonathan a long time.
I knew that he wanted to marry me but that he felt that he should have more to offer.
Oh, John...
...you see, back home, life was piling up on me.
Teaching poetry to a lot of high school kids that didn't like it...
...and didn't like me because I made them learn it.
Furnished rooms, cafeterias and men you wouldn't shake a stick at.
Don't you see? Like any other girl...
...I wanted a new life and a home of my own too...
...so when Jonathan wrote me about the life out here and the excitement...
...I just packed up and took the first train.
I like Jonathan. I admire him...
...and I came out to see if perhaps we could find a life together.
It's still no good.
- Well, I've knifed him in the back.
- Oh, no, John. Please believe me.
If I had left you last night,
I never would have married Jonathan.
I'd have gone away without seeing him...
...because I knew I'd love only one man the rest of my life.
Hey, open up and buy me a drink.
It's Cornelius Vanderfeller.
Come on, open up.
I love you, John.
And I love you.
Come on, hurry up. Open up. Open up.
Boy, did you miss it.
We were pounding the old...
- Bet...?
- Jonathan.
We were married last night, Shorty.
Wait a minute. I don't get this.
He never knew about us. I just told him.
She wanted to go, but I couldn't let her.
I couldn't let her go, see, Shorty?
It happened just that way, so I dug up Judge Martin.
Well, say something, Shorty.
Take a sock at me or something.
- You sure this is the way you want it?
- Yes, Jonathan.
You see, when I came out here last night...
Okay, Betsy.
Thank you, Jonathan.
Well, I guess that's the way it is.
I gotta get to the well.
I got a lot of things to do.
No need in you coming out right away.
I'll see you both out there later.
Honey, that's a guy.
Ed.
Okay, everybody.
Come on and have a drink with the Murphy boys from Arizona.
Ed, a Rolls-Royce.
You must be in the money.
- We are.
- Welcome home.
- Lucky Ed.
- Hey, Big John.
Big John! Pull over with that horse.
Come on over, we're setting them up.
Tom, Ed, you long-lost Comanches.
I heard you hit it.
- Yeah, we hit it, and we're spending it.
- Tom, Ed.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
- Well, I see you brought a stranger.
- Hi, honey.
Stay away from him, baby.
He's an old married man now.
I never hurt you, did I?
How's the fireplace and slippers?
- Everything's fine. How you been?
- Just dandy.
Swell. Hey, two wildcats, they tell me. Give me an earful.
How deep did you have to go?
Wouldn't mean nothing to a big producer like you.
- Is there any more good-looking...?
- A million acres of it.
- Let's all have a drink. Come on, baby.
- Say, I can't.
- My wife called and wants me home...
- We heard you got lassoed.
For life. And it's okay, pal.
But she wants me home early.
Something about the new house.
Don't go away, I'll be back.
- We'll be waiting for you.
- Not for long, brother.
Hey, honey.
Behold the bridegroom.
Here, congratulations, my boy.
Have a drink.
- One year married and he can't believe it.
- Used 14 eggs.
- Angel grub, they call it.
- Honey, I forgot.
Well, that proves
I've really got a husband.
But I ought to have a present or something.
I've got my present right here, all around me.
Darn it, we ain't got much time for that sparking.
- We'll be ready, Harmony.
- Come on, everybody.
- To Betsy.
- Yes.
To beautiful darling Betsy number one.
Hey, who do you think's in town?
Tom and Ed Murphy.
Just brought in two wildcats up in Arizona.
What do you say we all go down and meet them after dinner at the hotel?
Sure, we can go...
...if you think they'll be interested in a couple of old married people.
Honey, I'm sorry.
To heck with them.
Say, I gotta wash up.
That must've been something, though, right out of nothing.
A new wildcat and the moose goes right into high gear.
Doesn't he?
I'm all set to carry on our cutthroat heart game after dinner.
- And, boy, will I give you the black queen.
- Oh, no, you won't.
There's gonna be no heart game tonight.
You two boys are eating and then running, if you don't mind.
- But I haven't got anything to do...
- Well, Luther, you see...
...it's this way...
Why don't you just stop thinking and go and pour me a drink.
I'm always mixing drinks or something.
Oh, they're such lovely flowers, Jonathan.
Thank you.
Place sure looks high-toned.
I guess that's the woman's hand does that.
Well, it's not exactly the way I planned it, but he took such an interest in it.
The horns from your well over the mantel, and the guns.
Oh, and that armor over there, he calls it his Sir Modred suit.
Well, that's the way it is, and that's the way I want it to be.
It's where I want to live forever and ever and never move away.
- That was a great dinner, Betsy.
- Thanks.
- See you in the morning.
- Shorty...
...why don't you see Tom and Ed and get a line on that Arizona setup.
No, I better run out to the field. I wanna take a look at number five. She's close.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- It's an invitation every year for you two.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I still don't see why we couldn't have had one hour's heart game.
Now I know you're over 60.
You do want to hear all about it, don't you?
- What?
- Those Arizona wildcats.
- No, honey, really.
- "No."
You're about as convincing as a little boy refusing a chocolate soda.
All right, come on. I've got some things to do around here anyway.
Only, it'll take about an hour, for your information.
- Sure you don't mind?
- No.
You go see the Murphy boys and sit around and lie a little bit to each other...
...and have a good time, see?
Only, just remember, you've got another wildcat waiting for you at home.
Oh, will I.
- I won't be more than a hour, darling.
- Right.
- John. John. Betsy.
- What's happened?
- Number five caught fire. Where's John?
- Well, he went into town.
You wake Harmony, I'll get a coat.
Harmony, go over to the firehouse.
Get Wilson and his nitro truck.
Tell him to bring 100 quarts.
Swing that wildcat.
Everybody's a wildcat in Arizona, huh, Ed?
Betsy, honey.
- Get out, Betsy. You don't belong in here.
- The Murphy boys.
- Do you hear me? You don't belong.
- Wait a minute.
- Why did you bring her here?
- I'm not spying on you to spoil your fun.
You're free to go on with it.
We just came to tell you that number five is on fire.
- Number five on fire?
- Yeah, you coming?
Harmony, take the missus home, then come right out.
- How did it start?
- Who cares? It started.
You get a hose on that tank.
If it goes, the whole field will go.
Everybody get back.
Hurry up with that shield.
- Where's that nitro truck?
- Listen, boss.
This is too dangerous for you fellas.
Three cans of nitro will blow her out like a birthday cake.
But that's wild oil and gas.
Let's wait for them fire dogs from Ranger.
We haven't got time to wait for them.
This baby's way ahead of us.
She's too hot. You can't get the nitro in close enough to blow her out.
You just unload it.
We'll get her close enough.
We're taking a shield in first.
We'll take in the nitro on the next trip.
All right, hit the water.
The top casing's split.
You can't tell where she'll shoot now.
Put more pressure on those lines.
If it was my durned well,
I'd let her burn herself out.
Quit yapping. Tell Jim to put another hose on that tank.
All right.
- Hot work, huh, Shorty?
- Lay off the Shorty.
Oh, behave. What did I do?
I just met Tom and Ed, got a little high, that's all.
I saw enough and heard enough
I didn't like.
Okay. If you see anything or hear anything you don't like from now on...
...don't go running to Betsy with it.
Just keep your nose...
What the dickens is the matter with you two fellas?
Never mind about this.
Get that battery ready.
Boys. Who's responsible for this catastrophe?
Watch where you're going, buddy.
You kick that can of nitro and you'll blow us to Alaska.
We'll touch it off after this trip, so get the truck away.
Hang that wire on me.
Somebody must have fallen asleep on the job.
Get the water.
They're using too much nitro.
They'll blow up the whole field.
I'll lose a fortune.
Give me the wire!
If that oil gets there first, the two Johns will blow back on us like fried hamburger.
- Hug the ground back there.
- Get back.
She's out.
Wonderful, boys. Marvelous.
I knew we'd do it. Look at her.
Here, come on, fellas.
Do something, will you?
- We're wasting a lot of oil.
- It's the biggest gusher yet.
Isn't big enough.
Call it. For the works.
- Okay, the whole outfit.
- Call it.
Tails.
You're on my land.
- Now, listen, Big John...
- Come on, everyone.
Look, big feller.
I'll fix you some nice, fresh coffee.
Forget it. All I need is some sleep.
Did you put out the fire?
- So you're calling it quits, huh?
- No, I'm afraid you did that.
You've always been straightforward and direct about things...
...and this like everything else.
Oh, don't worry.
There isn't going to be a scene.
I'm just no good at picking wildcats,
I guess.
As you'd say, the land was pretty attractive, but the structure fooled me.
And now I'm down to clay and salt water.
Not that I blame the clay and salt water.
Some people might like it, but I don't.
You sure got in way over your head, didn't you?
I'll be out of here in a minute.
Harmony can take me to the early train, if you don't mind.
- Unless, of course, there's an explanation.
- No.
You got it all figured out.
You do it the way you want to.
Harmony, will you come and get my bags, please?
My God. God, did old Square John sure give him what he deserved.
He broke him flatter than a can on a railroad track.
You mean they had a fight?
Fight? They flipped for the whole field,
Miss Betsy...
...and now that big, dumb pit dog you're leaving...
...ain't worth much more than that lead dollar that they tossed with.
Yes, sir.
Long as you're gonna go, why...
...you sure picked a nice morning for it.
Oh, my darling. You and Jonathan mustn't fight about this.
- You've been such good friends.
- He and I have our own fight.
That's my business.
You and me, well, that's your business, and mine.
So, what about it?
I don't want to leave you.
All the time I was in here packing like an idiot...
...I was just wanting you to come and put your arms around me...
...and tell me nothing happened.
Nothing did.
I'm such a fool.
Oh, you're my gal.
But we're broke.
Gotta start in all over again.
- We'll go wildcatting, huh?
- It means selling this house.
Oh, who cares about this house?
I was just thinking this afternoon, well, here we are, tied down to it.
It's a millstone.
We're just buried under a lot of plaster and 2-by-4s.
- Honest? Do you feel that way?
- Sure I do.
Oh, you are my gal.
Well, wildcatting it is.
Our house will be wherever we are.
If there's oil at the North Pole, we'll live in an igloo.
And you won't freeze to death either.
Harmony, Harmony. Come on.
There's a big ruckus over at Eva's.
All right. Come on, come on, come on.
Does anybody else wanna say anything about McMasters?
Disturbing the peace, huh?
Let's go to the calaboose.
Two agin one, it ain't manly.
Look, sonny boy. Two weeks of this bust is about enough.
- You're getting to be Huckleberry Finn.
- You don't understand.
Big Moose is no good, but I'm the only one's got a right to say so.
Well, why don't you start traveling and hunt him up.
- He's no good.
- Oh, I thought so.
Here again. Now, look here, my boy.
You've got to sober up and get back to the field.
I've got my business.
I can't handle your work and mine too.
- I've got a...
- Do you wanna buy me out?
I couldn't. I'd...
- For what price?
- Wait a minute, honey.
Any price you say.
Well, now, that might be arranged, John.
That's a good idea. I'll have the papers in my office in half an hour.
All right. I'll be there.
You can't go into a deal with this vulture when...
I'm through. I'm gonna go away.
I never wanna see another oil derrick as long as I live.
Evie, you're a good kid, but keep all your teeth.
Oh, Square John.
I'll see you on the slab, Evie.
Listen, Square John,
I've been trying to tell you all the...
Why, I...
It wasn't your fault, was it?
You were just doing your job.
You're probably stuck on him too.
All right, here's your percentage for this month.
Good American dollars.
Business is getting a little better, see?
But look... What is it?
That new batch of men off the boat are signing up now.
All right, I'll be right out.
General, you tell your boss
I gotta have a little cooperation.
These lollipop guards of yours are drunk half the time.
What happens to my layout if that crowd throws you boys out of office?
Cockroaches.
Mr. Sand, everything is in the bag.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Capt. Morgan.
- What can I do for you today?
- Same thing as yesterday.
You and your client wish to make a temporary exit from the port?
That is right.
- Name?
- Harry Morgan.
- Nationality?
- Eskimo.
- What?
- American.
- Name of ship?
- Queen Conch, Key West, Florida.
We're going fishing, like we've done every day for over two weeks.
We'll be back tonight, and I don't think we'll go more than 30 miles offshore.
Five francs, please.
One more thing.
You will go nowhere near the vicinity of territorial waters...
Sainte-Lucie, or Dominique.
- Is that a new order?
- Yes.
The decree was issued last night by his Excellency, Admiral Robert...
Governor General of the French West Indies.
Good for him.
- Why, any complaints?
- No.
Hello, Harry. How's everything?
That feels good.
- Did you bring me a drink?
- Horatio's bringing it.
You're my pal, Harry.
We sure got them this morning.
- We got them every morning.
- Not last Thursday.
That's right, I forgot.
You're right, Eddie.
Here's Horatio. Give him a hand, will you?
- Good morning, mon Capitaine.
- Good morning.
- Did you get the bait?
- Yes, sir. Plenty of it.
- That guard took a bottle of our beer.
- Mr. Johnson can afford it.
- Harry, can I have....
- Just one.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
- Are we going out?
- That's up to you.
What sort of a day will it be?
I don't know.
Just about like yesterday. Only better.
- Let's go out, then.
- Okay. Hop aboard.
- Stand by to cast off.
- All right, mon Capitaine.
- Mr. Johnson.
- Yeah?
- I got to get some gas.
- All right.
I'll need money for that.
How much?
28 cents a gallon. 40 gallons.
That'll be $11 .20.
There's $15.
- I'll get you some change at the gas dock.
- Put it against what I owe you.
Let her go.
Watch it, Johnson.
There's your strike.
Put on a little more drag. Not too much.
You'll have to sock him.
He's gonna jump, anyway.
Hit him again. Hit him three or four times.
Stick it into him.
Better get the other teaser in.
I got him!
Ease up on that drag.
He's gone.
He's not. Ease up on that drag. Quick.
If he wants to go, let him go.
- He's gone.
- No, he's hooked good.
- He sure is.
- Reel him in.
No. I'm sure he's gone.
I'll tell you when he's gone.
Reel in fast.
- He's gone now.
- Yes, sir, he's gone now.
- He isn't. Turn around and chase him.
- Reel in that line.
- I can still feel him pull.
- That's the weight of the line.
- You're crazy. I can hardly reel it in.
- Maybe he's dead.
Maybe. But he's still jumping out there.
- Come on. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying, Mr. Johnson.
- Can't you put bait on like that, Captain?
- Sure I can.
- Why carry this fellow to do it?
- When the big fish run, you'll see.
What's the idea?
He can do it faster than I can.
A dollar a day seems like an unnecessary expense to me.
He's necessary. Aren't you, Horatio?
I hope so.
Can't Eddie do it?
No, he can't.
What's the matter?
He just lost a fish.
Mr. Johnson, you're unlucky.
Would it be all right if I...
- In the icebox. Just take one.
- Thanks.
I don't see why you want that rummy around.
Eddie was a good man on a boat before he got to be a rummy.
He's no good now.
Start her going ahead.
- Is he related to you or something?
- No.
- What do you look after him for?
- He thinks he's looking after me.
All right, let her run.
- Mr. Johnson.
- Yeah?
Do you mind if I ask you a question?
Look, it might interest you to know
I not only bought the beer...
- but I put a deposit on the bottles.
- Was you ever bit by a dead bee?
- A dead what?
- A dead honeybee.
I was never bit by any kind of a bee.
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.
In that case, I'll just finish my nap.
Thanks for the beer.
Watch that line.
That's enough for one day.
- What happened?
- Nothing. You just lost a rod and reel.
You had the drag screwed tight.
When the fish struck, you couldn't hold it.
If you had the harness buckled down to the reel... that fish would have taken you along with him.
You're just unlucky, Mr. Johnson.
Now, maybe you're lucky with women.
- What do you say if we go out tonight?
- I'll lucky you, you dirty rummy.
- Are you a good swimmer?
- I've taken all I'm gonna take.
Me, too. Be careful you don't slip out of my hands.
Take it easy.
This guy owes you for 16 days.
Fifteen.
You talk too much, Eddie.
I know it, Harry.
Okay, forget it.
What about tomorrow?
I don't think so.
I'm fed up with this kind of fishing.
I can see how you would be.
Slack that off a little.
You fish for 16 days, hook a couple of fish any good fisherman... would give his life to tie into, and lose both.
- You're just unlucky. I never seen no one...
- Shut up, Eddie.
You said 16 days. I only owe you for 15.
No. With today it's 16.
Then there's the rod and reel.
- The tackle's your risk.
- Not when you lose it like you did.
I paid to rent it every day.
It's your risk.
If you ran a hired car over a cliff, you'd have to pay for it.
- Not if he was in it. That's a good one.
- That's good, Eddie.
You lost the outfit through carelessness.
It cost me $275.
I won't charge you for the line, 'cause a fish so big could've taken it all anyway.
And there's 16 days at $35 a day, that's $560.
No, it's $560, Eddie.
You got a little credit, so that'll be $825 altogether.
That's what you owe me, and that's what I want.
I haven't got that much with me.
I'll go to the bank in the morning.
- That'll be all right?
- I guess it'll have to be.
- Let's go have a drink.
- Good idea...
- Stay here and lock up.
- Sure you don't...
No, Eddie.
Look there. I thought everybody took their flag in after 6:00.
- Most of them do.
- That's Vichy for you.
It's their flag.
See you later.
Gentlemen, may I have your names?
What for?
I heard this gentleman make a disparaging reference to Vichy.
I never said anything about Vichy, did I?
I don't know,
I wasn't paying much attention.
- Your names, please.
- Look, we're Americans....
His name's Johnson. My name's Morgan.
We're living at the Marquis Hotel.
That do you?
Yes, sir?
- What's yours?
- Bourbon.
Bourbon. And a rum for me.
- Gentlemen, what luck today?
- Not so good, Frenchy.
- We lost the biggest fish I ever saw.
- Maybe tomorrow you hook him again.
Not me. I'm through. This is my last day.
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.
Here's to you.
I'm gonna clean up.
- That was $800 and....
- Johnson.
- Yeah?
What time tomorrow morning?
After I get to the bank.
Say around 10:30 or 11:00?
I'll be waiting for you.
- Any trouble, Harry?
- No, Frenchy.
- Then you are free after today?
- Yeah. Why?
There were some people in here today.
They wanted to hire your boat.
- Fishermen?
- No. Some friends of friends of mine.
Not a chance.
- The key, monsieur.
- Thank you.
Please listen to me, Harry.
They only want to use your boat for one night.
- They'll pay you well.
- For what?
I'd like to oblige, but I can't afford to get mixed up in local politics.
I would not speak if it weren't important.
Please, can I go with you to your room?
Sure. Come ahead.
Anybody got a match?
Thanks.
Who's that?
She came in this afternoon.
The plane from the south.
Now look, Frenchy, about that other thing.
I know where you stand and what your sympathies are.
It's all right for you, but I don't want any part of it.
If I'm caught fooling with you fellas, my goose'll be cooked.
Probably lose my boat, too.
I ain't that interested.
But they are coming to see you tonight.
You better get word to them.
They'll just be wasting their time.
Sorry. I'll see you later.
Take over.
Bravo!
I tried to reach those fellows, but I can't get in contact with them.
Who? The ones who wanted to hire my boat?
It's dangerous enough for them to come at all, but to come for nothing...
I didn't ask to see them.
You better head them off.
- Hello.
- Let's have it.
- What do you want?
- Johnson's wallet.
- What?
- Come on.
What are you talking about?
Mister, what's got into you?
What do you think you're gonna do?
I'm gonna get that wallet, Slim.
I'd rather you wouldn't call me Slim.
I'm a little too skinny to take it kindly.
Quit the baby talk.
Which is it?
You know, Steve,
I wouldn't put it past you.
I didn't know you were a hotel detective.
Johnson's my client.
He doesn't speak so well of you.
He's still my client.
Pick on somebody to steal from that doesn't owe me money.
He dropped it and I picked it up.
You were gonna give it back to him, of course?
No, I wasn't.
- I don't like him.
- That's a pretty good reason.
Besides, I need boat fare to get out of Martinique.
Another good reason... but you'll have to get it from somebody else.
- How do you like that?
- Find anything?
About $60 in cash and about $1,400 in travelers checks.
Do you expect more?
That bird owed me $825.
"I haven't got that much on me," he says.
"I'll have to go to the bank and pay you off tomorrow," he says.
And all the time he's got a reservation on a plane leaving tomorrow at daylight.
So he was gonna skip out on you.
Your client.
- Good thing you didn't give it back to him.
- Then I did you a favor.
That's right.
But if I hadn't stopped you... you'd have gotten away with the whole works.
After all, I am entitled to something.
Don't you think so, Slim?
What do you think is fair?
I'll leave that to you.
What would you say to....
Please, Harry.
I told them, but they insisted...
It is not Gerard's fault, Mr. Morgan.
Come in and close the door.
You know,
I told Frenchy I wasn't interested.
I know. But close the door, please.
I'm very sorry to intrude this way...
- but this is of great importance and we...
- One moment.
I'd better go.
- See you later.
- Stick around. We're not through yet.
It's all right to talk in front of her, isn't it?
- Go ahead.
- But it's no good.
- If you'd listen...
- No use.
- You're taking a chance coming here.
- We're not afraid.
I am. I'm sorry, I can't and won't do it.
We'll give you 2,500 francs.
- That's only $50 in American money.
- It is more to us.
It is only a little voyage to a place about 40 kilometers from here.
- We'd give you more money, but we can't.
- It's all we have.
Don't make me feel bad.
I tell you true, I can't do it.
Afterwards, when things are changed, it would mean a good deal to you.
Yes, I know.
Mr. Morgan, I thought all Americans were friendly to our side.
They are. But there's a rumor that they put fellas on Devil's Island... for doing what you're doing.
I'm not that friendly to anybody.
But they wouldn't do that to an American.
Do you really think that?
- Who's that?
- It's me, Harry.
It's all right.
- Hi, Harry? How you been keeping?
- Hello, Eddie.
- I wanted to talk to you about...
- Could we continue...
Who are you? Who are these guys, Harry?
Eddie's a friend of mine.
He was hanging around the dock after you left.
You have a good memory for one who drinks.
Drinking don't bother my memory.
If it did I wouldn't drink.
I couldn't. You see...
I'd forget how good it was.
Then where would I be?
- I'd start drinking water again.
- Maybe you'd forget about water, too.
No, I wouldn't. I see too much of it.
Was you ever bit by a dead bee?
I've no memory of ever being bit by any kind of bee.
Were you?
You're all right.
You and Harry's the only ones that...
- Don't forget Frenchy.
- Right. You, Harry and Frenchy.
You got to be careful of dead bees if you go around barefooted.
If you step on them, they can sting just as bad as if they was alive.
Especially if they was kind of mad when they got killed.
- I bet I've been bit 100 times that way.
- You have? Why don't you bite them back?
That's what Harry always says.
But I ain't got no stinger.
- Does he always talk so much?
- Always.
- What do you want to see me about?
- Oh, yeah, Harry....
I guess I forgot.
That's all right. I'll see you down at the dock later tonight.
Say, Harry, could you....
Thanks. You're all right. So long.
Sorry. We could stay at this all night and the answer would still be the same.
I don't care who runs France or Martinique, or who wants to run it.
You'll have to get somebody else.
Come on, Slim.
We still got some unfinished business.
Good night.
Make yourselves at home, boys.
Cigarettes are on the table over there.
I want to see Johnson's face when you give it back to him.
All right.
Where've you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
You're a fine one, running off with my girl.
She's got something she wants to give you. Go ahead, Slim.
Here's your wallet.
- How did you get it?
- I stole it.
That's a fine thing.
What are you gonna do about it?
The question is, what are you going to do about it?
You'd better look it over and see if it's all there.
It's all right, I'm sure.
No, you check it over.
She might want a receipt for it.
- It's all right. There's nothing missing.
- You sure?
Yeah. Now, young lady, I...
You better count those travelers checks.
- I know. There's $1,400.
- But you had to go to the bank tomorrow.
What's the time on that plane ticket you got there?
In the morning.
And the bank opens at 10:00.
- I don't like him any better than you do.
- I was going to...
You were going to sign some of those traveler's checks, weren't you?
- Yeah. Sure.
- Emil, you got a pen handy?
- Yeah.
Stay where you are!
- Stay where you are.
- I think I'm sitting on someone's cigarette.
- This is awful.
- Did they get them all?
One got away, at least.
I think it was Beauclere.
Look, Harry, this is bad.
But no one but me knows that you two saw them.
And Eddie, but he won't remember.
When the police come, you know nothing.
Do you realize, mademoiselle?
Don't be a fool. Stay inside.
Monsieur Gerard!
Cut it out, Cricket.
He couldn't write any faster than he could duck.
Another minute and these checks would have been good.
Stay right where you are and keep quiet!
Stay right where you are.
- Who's that?
- Sûreté Nationale.
Gestapo?
Lot of them, isn't there?
- What happened to this man?
- A stray bullet.
His name is Johnson, an American.
- Unfortunate. Take him away.
- Yes, sir.
Call attention.
Your attention, everyone.
All this is regrettable, but there is no cause for alarm.
We are only interested in those persons... who have broken the rules laid down for their behavior.
We shall pick out certain individuals.
Those we do not designate will leave immediately.
This place will then remain closed for tonight.
This man.
You.
And mademoiselle.
Was you ever bit by a dead bee?
Come with me, please.
I tell you, I didn't know those men.
They came in for a drink. That's all I know.
- You say you never saw these men before?
- No.
What are your sympathies, Monsieur Gerard?
I am for France.
That is well. Try to remain so.
Let us suggest to Monsieur Gerard... that the next time suspicious characters enter his place... that he notify us.
In that way he may prevent bloodshed at his doorstep.
I run a public place.
How am I to know who is suspicious and who is not?
- I think you will know. Good night.
- That is all. You may go.
- Got all of them?
- Beauclere and Emil got away.
- How?
- Jumped off the wagon, ran up an alley.
- Search all the places on your list.
- Yes, sir.
- Continue.
- Did you know these men?
I didn't.
- You did not see them at all in the café?
- Right.
What was your connection with the dead man?
- He rented my boat to fish from.
- You mean he had rented it.
The tickets in his wallet show he was to leave Martinique at daylight.
There was no money on him or in his wallet.
Only some American travelers checks.
Was that customary with him?
There was $60 in it.
- What happened to it?
- I took it.
- Why?
- Because he owed me $825.
So at least you had no reason to kill him, did you?
- So it would seem.
- But unfortunately for you, someone did.
As a result of which, you took it on yourself... to collect a part of the debt.
- That's right.
- You have this money now?
If you please.
If you please, Capitaine.
This is mine.
How do we know that?
Thank you. Do not be concerned.
This money is impounded by a government which, like your own... is at peace with the world.
If your claim is just, it will be discharged.
Mademoiselle. That is all for you.
"Browning, Marie. American, age 22."
How long have you been in Fort de France?
I arrived by plane this afternoon.
- Residence?
- Hotel Marquis.
Where do you come from?
Trinidad. Port of Spain.
And before that, from where, mademoiselle?
- From home, perhaps?
- No. From Brazil, Rio.
- Alone?
- Yes.
- Why did you get off here?
- To buy a new hat.
Why?
To buy a new... hat.
Read the label.
Maybe you'll believe me then.
I never doubted you, mademoiselle.
It is only your tone that was objectionable.
I'll ask you again.
Why did you get off here?
I didn't have money enough to go any further.
That's better. Where were you when the shooting occurred?
- I was...
- You don't have to answer.
- Shut up, you.
- Don't answer it.
- I told you to shut up.
- Go ahead. Slap me.
Come, Capitaine. This is not a brawl.
We wish to get to the bottom of this affair.
You'll never do it by slapping people around.
That's bad luck.
We shall see.
If we need to question you further, you will be available at the hotel?
I don't know how I'm gonna go any place when you got my passport and money.
Your passport will be returned to you.
As for the money... if it is yours, that will arrange itself in good time.
Do you suggest I see the American Consul and have him help you arrange it?
That is your privilege.
By the way, what are your sympathies?
- Minding my own business.
- May I...
I don't need any advice about continuing to do it, either.
- Good night, Capitaine.
- Let's get out of this.
Say, I don't understand all this.
After all, I just got here.
You landed right in the middle of a small war.
What's it all about?
The boys we just left joined with Vichy.
You know what that is?
- Vaguely.
- They've got the Navy behind them.
- You saw that carrier in the harbor?
- Yeah.
The other fellas they were shooting at, they're the Free French.
- You know what they are?
- It's not getting any clearer.
Most of the people on the island, the natives, are patriots.
They're for de Gaulle, but so far they haven't been able to do much about it.
- Are we in trouble?
- No, Eddie.
- I seen them pick you up and was scared...
- Everything's okay.
Go back and get some sleep.
I'd have got you out. You know me.
I know you, Eddie.
You go on back to the boat.
- Harry, could you...
- No.
- But...
- No more tonight, Eddie. Beat it.
- I could use a drink myself.
- We can get one in here.
What do you wish to drink, sir?
What'll it....
We're just looking around.
Change your mind?
No money. Those guys cleaned me out.
I forgot, too.
Maybe I can do something.
This has been a long day, and I'm thirsty.
Picked him out yet?
You don't mind, do you?
If you're thirsty, go ahead.
If I get tired of waiting I'll be at the hotel.
All right.
May I?
Thanks.
Hello.
Come on in.
- You're sore, aren't you?
- Why should I be?
- I didn't behave very well, did I?
- You did all right.
You got the bottle, didn't you?
- You're sore, aren't you?
- Get this straight. I don't give...
I know. You don't give a whoop what I do.
But when I do it you get sore.
After all, you told me to, you know.
- I told you?
- You said go ahead, didn't you?
That's right. I guess I did.
You were pretty good at it, too.
Thanks.
- Would you rather I wouldn't?
- Wouldn't what?
Do things like that.
- Why ask me?
- I'd like to know.
- Of all the screwy...
- All right. I won't do it anymore.
- I didn't ask...
- I know you didn't.
Don't worry.
I'm not giving up anything I care about.
It's like shooting fish in a barrel, anyway.
Men like that. They're all a bunch of....
I'm a fine one to talk.
The pot calling the kettle.
How long have you been away from home?
- This is about the time for it, isn't it?
- Time for what?
The story of my life.
Where do you want me to begin?
I got a pretty fair idea already.
- Who told you?
- You did.
- That slap in the face you took.
- What about it?
You hardly blinked an eye.
It takes a lot of practice to do that.
Yeah, I know a lot about you, Slim.
The next time I get slapped
I better do something about it.
- You forgot your drink.
- I don't want it.
- Who's sore now?
- I am.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
The door's unlocked.
- You forgot your bottle.
- I said I didn't want it.
You are sore, aren't you?
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer me.
I said you're sore, aren't you?
Look, I'm tired and I want to get some sleep.
That's not a bad idea.
What made you so mad?
- I've been mad ever since I met you.
- Most people are.
One look and you decided just what you wanted to think about me.
You were.... What's the use?
Go ahead. Keep on going.
You don't know me, Steve.
It doesn't work.
I brought that bottle up here to make you feel cheap.
That didn't work either.
Instead, I'm the one who feels cheap.
I've never felt that way before.
I wanted....
I thought that maybe....
Go on. Get out of here before I make a complete fool of myself.
How long have you been away from home?
It's none of....
About six months.
Going back?
- How?
- What are you gonna do here?
I don't know. Get a job, maybe.
Jobs are hard to get.
I don't think you'd like it here anyway.
Remind you of somebody, Steve?
This is brand new to me. I like it.
Would you go back if you could?
I'd walk... if it wasn't for all that water.
Quit worrying, kid.
You'll get back all right.
- What the....
- Here's that bottle again.
It's getting to be quite a problem, isn't it?
- You want a drink?
- No.
I thought you were tired and going to bed.
I know. I thought so, too.
You gave me something to think about.
- You said you might be able to help me.
- That's right.
But how can you do that if....
Are you gonna take that job with those men that were up here with Frenchy?
Yeah, if I can find what's left of them.
I flew over Devil's Island.
It doesn't look like a high-class resort.
- That's what I heard.
- I don't want to be the cause...
Don't get the idea I'm doing this just to help you. I need money, too.
Won't Frenchy help you out without you having to do that?
I don't want his help.
Don't do it, will you, Steve?
- Look, didn't you ask me...
- Don't do it.
Why don't you take this bottle and go to bed?
Here. Can you can use this?
I thought you said you were broke.
You're good. You're awful good.
"I'd walk home if it wasn't for all that water."
- Who was the girl, Steve?
- Who was what girl?
The one who left you with such a high opinion of women.
She must have been quite a gal.
You think I lied to you about this, don't you?
It just happens there's about $30 here.
Not enough for boat fare or any other kind of fare.
Just enough to be able to say "no" if I feel like it.
And you can have it if you want it.
I'm sorry, Slim.
But I still say you're awful good and I wouldn't...
I forgot. You wouldn't take anything from anybody, would you?
That's right.
You know, Steve... you're not very hard to figure.
Only at times.
Sometimes I know exactly what you're going to say.
Most of the time. The other times....
The other times you're just a stinker.
- What did you do that for?
- I've been wondering whether I'd like it.
What's the decision?
I don't know yet.
It's even better when you help.
Sure you won't change your mind about this?
This belongs to me, and so do my lips.
I don't see any difference.
I do.
Okay.
You know you don't have to act with me.
You don't have to say anything and you don't have to do anything.
Not a thing.
Maybe just whistle.
You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve?
You just put your lips together and blow.
Here, chick.
You keep watching.
It's all right. They have gone.
Go on.
You come along the lee shore of Anguilla from the south.
About three kilometers from the point.
- There's a little cove and a jetty?
- You know it, then.
- The signal's been arranged?
- Emil can show you.
- Emil's not gonna be there.
- Why?
I'm doing this my way. I'm going alone.
What are the signals?
You flash a light to the shore.
They will answer it with two lights.
One held above the other.
There'll be two people to bring back.
- How'll I know them?
- We've never seen them.
We know the name of one only.
Paul de Bursac.
That's good enough.
How about landing them back here?
Do you know Cape Sainte-Pierre?
- A boat can meet you offshore there.
- You be on that boat, Frenchy.
I'll get out of here around noon.
Supposedly fishing.
With luck and no patrol boats,
I'll be back in Sainte-Pierre at midnight.
I won't be burning any lights, so keep a sharp lookout.
One thing, Mr. Morgan.
Last night you very definitely refused to have anything to do with us.
Why have you changed your mind?
I need the money now. Last night I didn't.
- If you knew what this means to us....
- I don't want to know.
I'm glad you're on our side.
I'm not. I'm getting paid.
And by the way, I'd like that money now.
If I were you, I do not think
I would trust Mr. Morgan.
Did a doctor look at his leg?
No. They are watching all doctors who are friendly to us.
- Miss the bone?
- As far as I can tell.
He's lucky.
Why did you put a pillow under it?
- Why not?
- It doesn't hurt so much that way.
It'll have to hurt, you'll have to take it... unless you want to take a chance of gangrene setting in.
All right, I'll take that.
Are you a doctor?
No. But I've handled quite a lot of gunshot wounds.
You can trust me now.
Good luck, Harry.
It's all right.
- More café, mademoiselle?
- Please.
- What is that you're playing?
- Did you say something?
What's the name of that tune?
It hasn't got any name yet.
I've just been fooling with the lyrics.
They're not so hot, either.
Would you like to hear them?
Sure.
So it goes.
- That's about as far as it goes.
- I like it.
Yes. If I could get the right lyrics.
- Good morning, Cricket.
- Morning, Harry.
- Good morning, Slim.
- Hello.
- How did you sleep?
- The best in a long time.
- Have some coffee?
- No, thanks. I've had mine.
You were up early. What were you doing?
I was getting you a ticket on the plane this afternoon. It leaves at 4:00.
- Can you make it?
- Sure.
You took that job, didn't you?
See, I figured this way you wouldn't get your feet wet.
Yeah. That's right.
- That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
- Sure.
I just....
- You want me to go, don't you?
- Yes, I want you to go.
Okay, Steve.
Help her get on that plane, will you, Cricket?
I sure will, Harry.
I'm gonna be pretty busy from now on, so I probably won't see you again.
- If I ever get up your way...
- Yeah. Do that.
I'll leave my address with Frenchy so you can find me.
Maybe I'll know how to whistle by then.
- So long, Slim.
- So long, Steve.
Well, it was nice while it lasted.
Maybe it's better this way, Slim.
I don't know.
You haven't known him very long.
He's a funny guy.
- How are you, Harry? How's everything?
- Fine. I told you to stay at the hotel.
- I knew you was going out.
- Who told you that?
You can't fool me, Harry.
I knew it just as plain.
- Say, could I have a little...
- You're not going.
Could I have a little one, just enough to fill a hen's ear?
- Come on, Eddie. Get off.
- What's the matter?
There's no sense in getting plugged at me.
Take it easy. You got...
I wouldn't do that to you.
You're right, you wouldn't.
I'm not gonna carry you, that's all.
- What did you have to hit me for?
- So you'd believe me.
- You ain't treating me square.
- Who do you treat square?
You'd double-cross your own mother.
You told me so yourself.
I was only kidding.
Thanks, Harry. I knew you was my pal.
- But why won't you carry me?
- Because I don't want you.
You know, you're just plugged.
Never mind, old pal, you'll be glad to see me yet.
All right. Come out of there.
It's only me, Harry.
How did you get back on board?
I went up the street for some bottles.
Then I sneaked in while you was working on the engine.
- I knew you'd carry me.
- Carry you, nothing.
If I thought you could swim back
I'd dump you overboard.
You're a joker. We've got to stick together when we're in trouble.
- How do you know I'm in trouble?
- You can't fool me. I always know.
Where we going, Harry?
What would you do if somebody shot at you?
Shot at me? With a gun?
- Who's gonna shoot at me?
- If you're lucky, nobody.
Where we going? What're we gonna do?
I'll tell you when the time comes.
Get out some tackle.
Aren't you glad you came?
No.
- Here. Put this on. It's getting cold.
- I'm all right, Harry.
Say, what's going on?
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Yes, there is, too.
What's all the darn guns for?
In case we run into a shark or something.
A shark? At night?
Or something?
What do you mean, "or something"?
- Watch your course.
- What's the matter?
We're going on a job.
I'll tell you what to do when it's time.
A job?
What kind of a job?
What do you expect me to do?
Do you know how to handle this?
Of course I know how.
Everybody knows how to handle a gun.
All you do is work the lever and pull the trigger. You know I know that.
Such foolish questions.
Do I know how to handle a gun.
- What do I got to work a gun for?
- I just wondered if you could.
You know I can.
Harry, sometimes you act stupid.
Just plain stupid.
Sometimes I think you don't pay no attention to nothing I say.
Is it gonna be that bad, Harry?
I don't know yet.
It all depends on how lucky we are.
That's why you didn't want to carry me.
I knew there was some other reason.
You wasn't mad at me at all.
You was afraid I'd get hurt.
You was thinking of me.
Watch your course, Eddie.
I feel better now, Harry.
I'll be all right. You'll see.
What's the matter?
What are you looking at me like that for?
What are you laughing at?
Just a joke that neither one of us knows the answer to.
What joke?
Whether you're gonna hold together or not.
Don't say that, Harry.
I'm a good man. You know I am.
You are, but you're going all over the ocean. Stay on your course.
Why do you always....
Could I have just one?
I don't want to get the shakes.
Make it a short one.
I want you rum-brave, not useless.
Thanks, Harry.
What's the matter, Harry?
- Who's that? What are we going to do?
- Pick up a couple of guys.
Here's what I want you to do.
Take this gun and get back in the stern.
If there's any trouble, start shooting.
But don't shoot me.
Supposing something happens to you?
What do I do then?
How do I know?
You invited yourself on this trip, not me.
All right, get back there.
My name's Harry Morgan. Beauclere sent me.
Get that light out of my face.
- What happened to Beauclere?
- He ran into a little trouble.
- What's your name?
- De Bursac.
That's the name. It's all right, Eddie.
Come on aboard.
Wait a minute.
He didn't say anything about a woman.
Permit me.
This is my wife, Madame de Bursac.
How do you do?
What do you want to bring a....
It's your funeral. Let's get out of here.
All right, Eddie. You can relax now.
Don't unload. We're not home yet.
If she gets cold, you can put her down in the cabin.
Mr. Morgan, just who are you?
I own this boat. Beauclere's paying me to get you people back to Martinique.
You're not one of us.
You're not on our side.
I don't understand.
I don't understand what kind of a war you're fighting... lugging your wives with you.
Don't you get enough of them at home?
- You say you're being paid for this.
- That's right.
Then I suggest you stop talking and take us to Martinique.
That's where we're heading right now.
- What's the matter, Harry?
- Keep quiet.
I thought I saw something out there.
Listen.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Shut up. You hear that?
Is it the patrol boat?
Don't you know those engines?
Sounds like she's off there.
Stand by that wheel.
Wait a minute. Give me that gun.
You can't fight them guys, Harry.
What's the matter with you?
You ought to be telling me how good you are.
I can do it. What do you want me to do?
If we're lucky, nothing. If we're not, hook her up and get away from here fast.
- What does this mean, Mr. Morgan?
- Trouble, if they see us.
- What can we do?
- You can't do anything.
Just get down on the deck, flat, and stay there.
But I don't know what good it'll do.
- If you try to resist, we will be killed.
- Shut up, both of you.
Get down on the deck, flat.
You save France. I want to save my boat.
Hook her up, Eddie. Let's go.
Don't shoot!
We got lucky again.
Ease her off and put her on 160 and then get that first-aid kit.
That's not so bad.
You wouldn't have that if you weren't so anxious to give up.
Please help me get him on the seat.
Leave him. I don't want him bleeding over my cushion.
- Here you are, Harry.
- You can have a drink now.
Thanks, Harry.
Help me off with his coat.
Easy now, boy.
All right. Get ready.
The man in that boat will take you on from here.
But I don't understand.
Some people spent a lot of time figuring this thing out.
They know more about it than we do.
This is de Bursac.
He's the other guy
I was supposed to pick up. His wife.
- My name is Gerard.
- How do you do?
- Easy with him. He's been shot up a little.
- What happened?
We ran into a patrol boat.
They'll tell you about it.
I'll cruise around and give you a chance to get ashore.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Good evening, Mama.
- I thought you said she pulled out.
- I thought she did.
Hello, Steve.
You were going to put her on a plane.
- What's the matter? Didn't it go?
- It went. But I decided not to.
You did? I went to a lot of trouble to get you out of here.
- That's why I didn't go.
- Yeah.
You dames.
A guy goes out and breaks his neck to....
I might have expected it.
You're not sore, are you?
- It'd be all right...
- I got a refund on that ticket. Here.
That's gonna help a lot.
You better hang onto it.
- We can use...
- She'll buy it for you.
- Nothing but beer for him.
- I'll remember.
We'll be all right. I've got a job.
- Doing what?
- Frenchy seems to think I can sing.
It's his place.
Sometimes you make me so mad I could...
You could do what?
Harry, I need your help.
What is it now?
That's all right. Go ahead.
That man is very badly wounded, Harry.
I looked at him. The bullet hit the gunnel, it was almost spent.
- All you got to do is take it out.
- Could you do it?
Me? I'm hotter than any doctor.
They would have recognized my boat.
They'll be on my tail soon.
- All I got to do is walk out of here.
- You don't have to go out.
- You didn't bring them here?
- In the cellar.
Why didn't you put them in a goldfish bowl and be done with it?
We had to do something.
They're watching every road out of town.
See what you got yourself into by sticking around?
I'm ready to go any time you are.
- Please, Harry, will you do it?
- Not a chance, Frenchy.
Your bill here at the hotel, being overdue... amounts to 6,356 francs.
She's right, Eddie.
You really keep the books, don't you?
We'll be glad to dismiss the whole matter if you will do this for us.
- Throw her bill in, too?
- Sure thing.
- All I got to do is take the bullet out...
- That's all.
You almost had me figured right, Mama, except for one thing.
I'll still owe you that bill.
Up in my room you'll find a medical kit.
It's gray, this big, has the boat's name on it.
- Bring it to the cellar.
- Sure.
Here's the key. Bring some hot water, too.
This way, Harry.
Can I help?
Just stay out of sight.
If you run across the police...
- don't forget what I told you to tell them.
- What was that, Harry?
Just stay out of sight, Eddie.
I remember.
What do you want here?
I'll tell you. I was sort of invited.
He asked me.
- You're not a doctor.
- No.
- Where's the doctor?
- Please, be patient.
I have been patient.
How do I know you know anything?
- You don't.
- Wait a minute.
How long has he been unconscious?
Just a few minutes.
He's got some fever and his pulse is a little low.
He'll be all right when we get the bullet out.
- Don't touch him. Do you hear?
- That's okay. I'm not getting paid.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
She's not herself.
- Who is she?
- Harry, you promised.
You want to help your husband, don't you?
Then use your head.
We can't get a doctor without giving the show away.
Besides, he's got as good a chance with me as anybody.
I'm not going to let you do it.
Why not?
He's no different from anybody else.
Just a little sicker, that's all.
It means he's not worth so much.
You can have another crack at me later on.
- Hello, Slim.
- Hello.
Miss Browning, Madame de Bursac.
Don't get tough with Slim.
She's apt to slap you back.
That's what you said you'd do, wasn't it?
Bring the water in here.
- Wait a minute....
- He's trying to help you.
- Who are you?
- Nobody. Just another volunteer.
- Where do you want this water?
- In that basin.
- Is it hot?
- Boiling.
All right, then. Pour some of this in it.
And drop these in.
- Get out of here. You may not like this.
- I'll be all right.
Then take this.
- What is it?
- Chloroform.
Get over by his head.
If he comes to while I'm probing... pour some of it on a hunk of cotton and give him a whiff of it.
Don't open it till I tell you to.
Take out about four of those.
George, bring that lamp a little closer so I can see what I'm doing.
That's good.
All right, Slim.
Hold that a minute.
Easy, boy.
All right, open that can and give him some.
George, see if you can hold his head down.
Come on, hurry up.
That's fine. Don't worry about her.
Pick up that can.
- Any of it left?
- I think there's enough.
Wait a minute, I don't think we'll need it.
He's out, too.
Bring that lamp down a little lower.
Frenchy, bring that basin over here.
And fan some of those fumes away, will you, or we'll all be out.
There you are, Frenchy, there's your bullet.
I told you it was spent.
It would have smashed the bone.
All right, I don't need that.
All right, you finish bandaging it up.
Adhesive tape in the box.
I got to get nursie out of here, or she never will come to.
What are you trying to do, guess her weight?
She's heftier than you think.
- You'd better loosen her clothes.
- You've been doing all right.
Maybe you'd better look after her husband.
- He's not gonna run out on me.
- Neither is she.
Is it all right if I give her a little whiff of this?
You're with us again.
You were lucky. You passed out.
What happened? We must....
We'll talk about that in the morning.
See if you can get some sleep.
Thanks.
Why did you ever come along with him on a trip like this?
I love him. I want to be with him.
- That's a reason.
- There's another reason.
They told me to come, our people did.
They said no man was much good if he left someone behind in France... for the Germans to find and hold.
- That makes sense.
- I told them I'd only be in the way... that I could do no good, that I was afraid.
But the worst of it is that it's been so hard for him to have me along... because I've made him that way, too.
Now he's afraid.
He didn't invent it.
- Invent what?
- Being afraid.
Thanks, Mr. Morgan.
The fever's gone.
Do you....
I'm no doctor, but he looks pretty good to me.
If he wakes up, give him another one of these pills.
- Mr. Morgan, I....
- You're not gonna faint again?
No, I'm just having a hard time trying to say something.
Go ahead, say it. I'm not gonna bite you.
If it hadn't been for you,
Paul might have....
I'm sorry for the way I've acted.
You're not sorry at all, you're just sorry you made a fool of yourself.
I have, haven't I?
You don't make me angry when you say that.
I don't think I'll ever be angry again with anything you say.
Another screwy dame. Now, how can you....
Good morning. I hate to break this up, but I've brought some breakfast.
- Good morning.
- How's your patient?
- He'll be all right...
- Or haven't you looked lately?
He'll be all right.
I'll be back this evening.
- If you need me before then, call me.
- I will.
Yes, and I hope you have everything you need here.
The eggs may be a little hardboiled...
- That's all right, I like them that way.
- You're lucky. Isn't she?
I'm gonna get some sleep,
I'll see you later.
Thanks.
- What do you want?
- I could use a match.
Thanks. Now I need a cigarette.
Here, I can do that. Come on, let me help.
When I get ready to take my shoes off,
I'll take them off myself.
All right.
- Want something to eat?
- No.
- Just a little breakfast?
- All I want to do is get some sleep.
It's a good idea. I can help you there.
- Now where are you going?
- I'm going to fix you a nice hot bath.
It'll make you sleep better.
I don't want you to take my shoes off,
I don't want you to get me breakfast...
I don't want you to draw me a hot bath...
- I don't want you to...
- Isn't there anything I can do, Steve?
- Yes, get the...
- You know, Mr. Morgan... you don't make me angry when you say that.
I don't think I'll ever be angry again at anything you say.
How am I doing, Steve, does it work the second time?
You've been wanting to do something for me, haven't you?
Walk around me.
Go ahead, walk around me, clear around.
- Did you find anything?
- No.
No, Steve. There are no strings tied to you, not yet.
I like that... except for the beard.
Why don't you shave... and we'll try it again.
- Later, Frenchy.
- Harry, wait.
Renard, the Inspector, is downstairs.
You better come down.
- I can't do that, I got to shave.
- He's got Eddie.
He's giving him drinks and asking him questions.
I was afraid of that.
Good thing you didn't get me in that tub.
Look out for those strings, Steve.
You're liable to trip and break your neck.
- Strings? I didn't see any strings.
- They just don't show, Frenchy.
You ought to have seen that fish.
It must have weighed 900 if it weighed a pound.
It was the biggest marlin you ever seen in all your born days.
You know, a marlin is a swordfish.
- Good morning, Capitaine.
- Hello, Harry. How's everything?
- Fine.
- Won't you join us?
It's a little early for this kind of a party.
Continue, Mr. Eddie.
Did you hear that? He called me mister.
Say, you're all right.
- Was you ever bit by a...
- No, he never was, Eddie.
Go on with what you were saying.
I was just telling him about the big one we hooked onto last night.
Sir, that fish was so big that me and Harry could hardly budge him.
We pumped on him until we was all wore out, didn't we?
That's right, Eddie.
It was after dark and we was still playing him.
He must have weighed at least 1,000 easy.
Every time Mr. Eddie takes a drink, this fabulous fish grows larger.
He must have started with a pretty small one.
How did you finally manage to land such a leviathan?
We didn't, didn't he tell you?
- We ran into a German submarine.
- A German submarine?
Whatever it was, it turned its light on and fired.
- I didn't wait to find out.
- I do not think...
You know, you can't be too careful these days.
I do not think anybody could give a more logical explanation... for refusing to obey the challenge of our patrol boat.
Not to speak of shooting out their searchlight.
- Patrol boat?
- Yes.
That's what it was. You were right, Eddie.
I'm a good man in the dark, always was.
Funny, he kept saying it was a patrol boat, but I wouldn't believe him.
There is one thing that is not clear to me, Capt. Morgan.
What's that?
Why does a professional fisherman go fishing for his own amusement?
Don't you ever ask any questions?
Don't you ever talk?
No, I guess you don't.
What were you saying?
Does a professional fisherman go fishing for his own amusement?
He does if he likes it, and we do, don't we?
Yeah, remember in Key West when we went...
- We don't seem to be getting anywhere.
- It was the Fourth of July...
I was just saying,
Key West, the Fourth of July... three years ago at 8:00. I got that in.
- What about your passengers?
- It was 7:00.
You oughtn't to burn up at him, you fed him the rum.
- What about your two passengers?
- What passengers?
The ones you brought from Anguilla.
He was waiting on the dock when we came in.
You think I got them ashore in my sleeve?
You could have landed them anywhere on our coastline.
Right, I could've at that.
- Would $500 refresh your memory?
- My memory's pretty good.
I remember that you're the guy who lifted my passport and my money.
Would your memory become any better if your passport and money were returned?
Does that include the $825
Johnson owed me?
- Why not?
- And the $500 you just mentioned?
You drive a hard bargain,
Capitaine Morgan.
That's no bargain.
If these people are so important...
- they're gonna be pretty hard to find.
- Not for a man of your resourcefulness.
Think it over and let me hear from you.
- Did you hear all of that?
- Most of it.
Bee lips went away pretty mad.
When he cools off, though, he's gonna start thinking.
He thinks now that you will turn them in.
- Isn't that what you want him to think?
- What will happen then?
- He hasn't searched this hotel yet, has he?
- Not yet.
There's your answer.
He doesn't want them, but the whole setup.
- What shall we do?
- It's not we, it's you.
You can't do anything until that fella gets strong enough to move.
Until then, you're probably safe.
Better get rid of this.
- Bring us some breakfast.
- Sure.
- I thought you didn't want any breakfast.
- I didn't then.
- What were you saying, Eddie?
- I've been figuring.
Them guys don't think that I'm wise, but they was trying to get me drunk.
They don't know me, do they, Harry?
I think they're trying to find out something.
What do you suppose it is?
- Don't you know?
- I ain't got no idea.
That's a good way to leave it.
You got the hiccups.
Have I, Harry? Yeah, I never noticed.
- You better take a drink of water.
- What, water?
- That's a good idea, Slim.
- No, not that.
- It'll do you good.
- I'll be all right.
- Eddie.
- Yeah, Harry?
Keep out of sight and stay away from the police.
They won't believe that story you told a second time.
What story was that, Harry?
Keep out of sight.
Seen Eddie around?
No, sir, Mr. Morgan,
I've not seen him all evening.
Where's Frenchy?
I'm going to work. Do you like it?
You won't have to sing much in that outfit.
- You know, sometimes you make me...
- That's why I do it.
- Haven't seen Eddie, have you?
- No, not since noon, why?
He left the boat and hasn't come back.
- Is there anything wrong?
- I don't know.
Don't look now, but over there at the second table... there's a guy with a mustache.
I think he's following me.
Keep an eye on him, will you?
I'm going downstairs.
Stick around awhile, she's going to sing.
- I'll be right back.
- Give her my love.
I'd give her my own if she had that on.
Here's the rest of the lyrics, Slim.
How do you feel?
- I could use a drink, Cricket.
- Sure, come on.
- What will you have, Slim?
- Scotch and soda.
Same.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Capt. Morgan.
- How are you feeling?
- Much better. I'm very grateful to you.
Forget it. Let me have a look at this.
- There's no bleeding.
- No.
- Does that hurt?
- Very little.
My only trouble is when I'm eating.
I'm awkward with my left hand.
We'll see if we can have you shot in the other arm next time.
You won't need me anymore.
Frenchy, I'm pulling out.
- When?
- Soon as I find Eddie.
- Is your friend missing?
- Yeah.
What happened?
I don't know, he left the dock and hasn't been back.
- Usually does what I tell him.
- I'm sorry if anything happened.
- I won't know until I find him.
- Couldn't you leave him here?
I don't think Eddie would like that.
Frenchy, as soon as I'm gone...
Renard will move in and turn this place upside down... so you better start figuring how and where you're gonna move him.
- Wouldn't it be best if we went with you?
- Why do you want to go?
I'm still trying to get out of the jam
I got into bringing you here.
Why'd you come here in the first place?
I know why she came, she told me, but why did you?
Have you heard of Pierre Villemars?
Pierre Villemars? Yeah, I read a headline.
He was quite a guy.
- Vichy got him. He's dead, isn't he?
- No.
He's on Devil's Island.
They sent me here to get him... to bring him back here to Martinique.
He's a man whom people who are persecuted and oppressed... will believe in and follow.
Just how are you gonna get him away?
You don't think much of me, Capt. Morgan.
You're wondering why they've chosen me for this mission.
I wonder, too.
As you know, I'm not a brave man.
On the contrary, I'm always frightened.
I wish I could borrow your nature for a while, Captain.
When you meet danger, you never think of anything... except how you will circumvent it.
The word failure does not even exist for you, while I....
I think always, "Suppose I fail"... and then I am frightened.
Yeah, I can easily see how it wouldn't take much courage... to get a notorious patriot off Devil's Island.
But just for professional reasons,
I'd like to know how you're gonna do it.
We will find a way.
It might fail, and if it does... and I am still alive...
I will try to pass on my information, my mission, to someone else.
Perhaps to a better man, who does not fail.
Because there is always someone else.
That is the mistake the Germans always make... with people they try to destroy.
There will be always someone else.
Originally, we planned to do everything from here.
But then, because of my own clumsiness, it was impossible.
And that's the reason we have to go with you.
I couldn't get you on the dock, there's a man there watching... there's one upstairs, they're everywhere.
- How would I get you through the streets?
- How will you go?
They're watching me to find you.
As long as I haven't got you along,
I can at least get on the boat.
There'll be a fog, and the tide will turn after midnight.
I can cut loose, drift out beyond the breakwater... before I start my engines.
I'll still have trouble enough, even without you.
- But, Harry...
- Capt. Morgan is right.
This is not his fight yet.
Some day I hope it may be, because we could use him.
You have done enough for us already.
Gerard told me of your refusing
Renard's offer to give us up.
How do you know I won't do it yet?
There are many things a man will do... but betrayal for a price is not one of yours.
Good luck.
- I hope you find your friend.
- Thanks.
Goodbye, and thanks.
Frenchy, I got a few things to talk to you about before I blow.
Then I'll be up in a little while, Harry.
Any sign of Eddie?
- Your friend's still sitting at his table.
- I know.
- What's the matter, Steve?
- I don't know.
I think the whole thing's gonna blow up, it's too quiet.
- What will you do?
- We'll leave tonight... as soon as I find Eddie.
We're leaving here for good, the three of us.
Wait, I want you to know what you're getting into.
It'll be rough, I'm broke.
If we get out... it'll be with a few hundred gallons of gas and a few francs.
Just enough to get us to Port-au-Prince maybe.
I've never been there.
I don't know when you'll get back home.
It could be a long time.
It could be forever, or are you afraid of that?
I'm hard to get, Steve.
All you have to do is ask me.
How long will it take you to pack?
There's a lot of people around here, save it.
We won't shove off till midnight.
Go ahead and go to work.
- All set, Slim?
- Sure, but don't make it sad, Cricket.
- I don't feel that way.
- You don't look that way, either. Let's go.
Top note, boys.
Madame de Bursac wants to see you.
- Look, Frenchy, that's all over.
- She's up in your room.
Why did you....
Please, Harry, that's all I will ask.
Thanks, Harry.
You shouldn't have come, it's too risky.
I told you I can't take you.
I didn't come up for that.
You've already done too much for us... but there's just one other favor
I'd like to ask.
I want you to take these.
They were my grandmother's, and her mother's before that.
She gave them to me when I got married.
They're all I've got left.
I want you to take them out of here and save them till we can...
Suppose they get me before I get out?
Then throw them overboard, at least they won't have them.
Suppose you never come for them?
Then let it be a part payment for all you've done for us.
Please, won't you?
Steve, Renard just came in, he's on his way up.
- Did he see you?
- I don't think so.
All right, you take these, both of you get in there and keep quiet.
As soon as I get rid of him, take her back to the cellar.
All right.
Good evening, may we come in?
Good evening.
No, I never carry them.
What's on your mind?
The whereabouts of the two people we are searching for.
- You haven't found them yet?
- No.
But since morning, through our sources, we've learned their names...
Monsieurand Madame de Bursac.
That is correct, is it not?
- How would I know that?
- I thought perhaps....
Very nice perfume.
- You like that?
- Yes.
So do I. All right, Slim, come out.
- You've met the boys.
- Good evening.
Mademoiselle. Now we are all here.
Except your friend, Mr. Eddie, as he likes to be called.
- So you got him.
- Yes.
Now we lack only the two missing persons.
What're you gonna do with him?
If you will not give us the information we want, perhaps he will.
Before we made the mistake of giving him liquor... this time we will withhold it.
- You know what that'll do to him?
- I think so.
- He couldn't stand it, he'd crack up.
- You could easily prevent that.
Yeah, I can.
You got a cigarette?
- Can't you make him talk?
- When necessary.
You'll find some in that drawer, Slim.
You could save Mr. Eddie a great deal of, shall we say, discomfort?
And me a lot of time, if you will tell us where these people are.
How much were you going to give me?
More than what's mine already?
I do not think now
I will have to pay anybody anything.
You're probably right.
- I haven't got a match.
- Don't go any....
All right, go on, get them up. Go on.
Pull your guns, go ahead.
Get them out. Go ahead and try it!
- You're gonna get it, anyway.
- Don't.
You've been pushing me around long enough.
You were gonna drive Eddie nuts.
Picking on a poor old rummy that never....
Slapping girls around.
That's right, go for it!
Your boy needs company.
Look at that, ain't that silly?
That's how close you came.
All right, Frenchy, get their guns.
Here you are.
Now get over on that couch.
Go ahead, step over him.
Sit down.
All right, come on out.
That's one of them, the other one's in the cellar.
Take her down, get some help.
Have them ready to leave on the boat, then come back here.
Slim, you pack.
We'll leave as soon as we get Eddie.
Okay, Steve.
- Just how do you think you...
- Shut up.
You want to know how I'm gonna get him out?
That broke as easy as you will.
There's a phone in the hall.
You're gonna tell someone to let him go, send him here.
Yes, you are, one of you.
I haven't forgotten you.
You'll both take a beating till someone uses that phone.
So one of you is gonna take a beating for nothing.
I don't care which one it is.
I'll start with you.
You will release him immediately.
- Tell him you'll explain later.
- I will explain it later.
Tell him to send him back to the hotel and do nothing else till you get there.
Send him back here to the hotel and do nothing until you hear from us.
All right, inside.
You've got some harbor passes to fill out.
And now Paul and Madame de Bursac.
I'll be right with you, Frenchy.
- They're all yours now.
- Thanks, Mr. Morgan.
They are all ready.
These will get them past the guard and on the boat.
Where will you take them?
- Maybe Devil's Island.
- What?
Might even get Villemars off, wasn't that what you wanted?
Very much. Why are you doing this, Harry?
I don't know.
Maybe because I like you, maybe because I don't like them.
I'm glad you are on our side, Harry.
No kissing, Frenchy.
- You'll have to take care of those guys.
- We will give you plenty of time.
If you let them go, they'll come back and burn this place.
Let them, it will be a very small fire.
When Villemars comes back, it'll be our turn. We'll start a bigger one.
Meet you on the boat.
One minute, please.
That's all right, let him through.
- How are you, Harry? How's everything?
- It's all right now.
You look glad to see me.
You know a funny thing...
Don't know what they wanted, but they wouldn't give me...
I'll get you one down on the boat.
We're leaving, Eddie.
- Ready, Slim?
- In a minute, Steve.
Close that, will you?
- Say, what is this, is she going with us?
- Yeah, it looks like it.
Harry, you mean.... What's she got....
- Who are you?
- Was you ever bit by a dead bee?
- Was you?
- Yeah.
You got to be careful of dead bees.
They can sting you just as bad as live ones.
Especially if they was kind of mad when they got killed.
I feel like I was talking to myself.
I bet I've been bit 100 times that way.
- Why don't you bite them back?
- I would. Only I haven't got a stinger.
I remember you. You're all right.
She can come, it's okay with me.
I'll have both of you to take care of.
That's right, Eddie.
You can begin by grabbing these bags.
Come on, Slim.
Do I have time to say goodbye to Cricket?
Sure, go ahead.
- I came to say goodbye.
- What?
We're leaving now. Thanks for everything.
- Hey, Slim. Are you still happy?
- What do you think?
ENGLISH - US
I hear them, Cheeta. I hear them.
Hiya, fellas!
Buli, look out.
Buli, Cheeta, it's a plane!
With a letter from Jane, maybe!
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Buli, go home.
Keep your eye on it, Cheeta!
Watch it, Cheeta! Watch it!
- Boy!
- Tarzan, over here!
Hurry, Cheeta! Hurry!
Cheeta.
Boy, hurry. Read letter from Jane.
All right, Tarzan. Don't get excited.
Boy excited, too.
"My darlings,
"I can't begin to tell you how much I miss you both
"and how happy I will be when this horrible war is over
"and I can come home to you again."
Tarzan happy, too.
"Many of the soldiers in the hospital where I am nursing
"have just been brought home from Burma
"and, in addition to their wounds, are suffering from jungle fever.
"It would be wonderful if you could send me some of the fever medicine
"which cured Boy when he was so ill,
"for I am certain that it would help our soldiers, too.
"You'll do this for me, won't you, Tarzan?"
Tarzan get. Read more.
Read more.
Boy, read more.
Now, let's see, where was I? Just a...
Oh, here I am.
Because the trip will take several days, you must not think of leaving
Boy and Cheeta this time.
The Great Desert will be very educational for them.
- Jane say Tarzan take Boy?
- That's right, Tarzan.
Read more what Jane say.
"And now I must say goodbye.
"Take good care of yourselves, my darlings,
"and remember that I love you
"and you are always in my thoughts and prayers.
"With all my love, Jane."
That's all, Tarzan.
- How soon will we be starting?
- What Boy say?
- Oh. Tarzan go tonight.
- Did you hear that, Cheeta?
We're gonna start right away!
Come on! Let's hurry!
My map's gone.
It was in this box.
Did you take it, Cheeta?
You didn't, huh?
Don't you know it's wrong to take things that belong to other people?
It's a bad habit.
You should be sorry.
Just think, Cheeta, we're gonna travel.
We're gonna see the Great Desert.
See this blank space here?
This is sand, nothing but sand.
This is where we are now, the escarpment.
Way across the desert is the fever medicine jungle.
Tarzan says it's full of wild animals and all sorts of mysterious things.
We might even see a city.
Here's El Ece Bra.
But it's miles and miles away from the fever medicine jungle.
Birherari here, it isn't so far away.
We might go there.
Tarzan's been to Birherari and so has Jane.
She's told me all sorts of things about the desert people there.
They wear clothes all the time.
Can you imagine that?
Heavy robes called a burnoose.
And things they wind around their heads they call turbans.
I bet you'd look funny in a turban.
We're gonna have lots of fun traveling across the desert.
Boy stay home.
Stay home?
- Fever medicine jungle dangerous.
- But I want to see Birherari!
Boy stay home.
But, Tarzan, Jane always said travel is very broadening.
Look, Tarzan, Cheeta wants to go, too.
All right. Boy and Cheeta come with Tarzan to edge of desert.
Then go home.
Desert no good place.
Jungle much safer than desert.
The Sheik has returned.
The devotion of your people is heartwarming, Sire.
I try to earn their love and respect.
In my own humble way, I, too, try to merit the approval of your people.
And failing that, you don't mind settling for their money, do you?
Selim, don't be rude.
Our friend here has brought much trade and prosperity to Birherari.
A philanthropist, I suppose.
A new role for you, eh, Hendrix?
I overlook your sarcasm.
Again I remind you that my offer to you still holds good.
You have only to speak to become my full partner.
Thanks. I'm not that easily bribed.
Selim, must you always argue thus?
I stand rebuked, my father.
Welcome home, Sire.
Did you have good hunting?
- We fared well. Look, look.
- The Sheik is a mighty hunter.
- It was he who bagged the biggest lion.
- And the fiercest.
Pardon.
Now, if you would excuse me, Sire.
Business, you know?
Business, always business.
No wonder the Hendrix enterprise is prospering.
- Hello, Karl.
- Herr Heinrich.
Idiot!
How many times must I tell you?
Here in Birherari call me Mr. Hendrix.
Sorry, it won't happen again.
- Did you also have good hunting?
- Excellent, as usual.
Sheik agreed I should also control the tobacco trade.
- Good. My congratulations.
- What's the news with you, Karl?
Oh, I manage to keep busy.
There was another visitor from El Ece Bra.
- Sightseer, no doubt?
- Yes.
He wanted to see Prince Selim.
I hope you were able to arrange a meeting.
- I was.
- Any complications?
None.
- Please. Please, Mr. Hendrix.
- What is it?
Is this what we get for one month's work at the looms?
- You get exactly what you earn, woman.
- Be on your way!
But for this we cannot buy enough to eat.
Then you should work a little harder.
Paul, the complaints are increasing, the people are growing restless.
- They talk of petitioning Prince Selim.
- He's a fool.
Suppose you let me worry about that?
Now, I have a more pleasant job for you.
On our way out of the jungle, we encountered a magnificent wild stallion.
The Sheik is very anxious to possess him.
Of course, and he would show his appreciation in a very practical way?
- Exactly.
- You may depend on me.
I'll bring in that stallion.
Tell men set horse free.
Now tell men set horse free.
All right, cut the stallion loose.
Men go.
Well, Tarzan, what are we waiting for?
Boy and Cheeta go back to escarpment now.
Tarzan, be a sport!
We want to help you get the fever medicine.
Jane ask Tarzan to get fever medicine.
Boy stay home.
Why, Tarzan, I don't remember reading anything like that in Jane's letter.
Then Boy read letter again!
Well, let's see.
Of course, you must not think of leaving
Boy and Cheeta this time.
The Great Desert will be very educational for them.
- Boy read letter like Jane say?
- Certainly, Tarzan, just like Jane say.
Why Boy lie?
Well, I had my fingers crossed.
It's lonesome on the escarpment without you, Tarzan.
All right.
Come, Cheeta.
Goodbye, Tarzan. Hurry home.
Boy wait.
Tarzan take.
Oh, Tarzan.
Look, Tarzan, it's the wild horse again.
He's thanking you, Tarzan.
Isn't he beautiful?
- Yes, beautiful.
- Let's take him with us.
No, horse want freedom just like everyone.
Go.
- Come, Boy.
- All right.
See, Tarzan? He wants to stay with us.
He's our friend.
- Please, let him come with us, Tarzan.
- All right.
Come on.
- I bet he wouldn't mind a bit if I rode him.
- No, horse wild.
Please let me try, Tarzan.
- All right, Boy try.
- Give me a boost.
- See? He's perfectly willing.
- Yes, horse willing.
We go to oasis, fill water bags.
That old yawner about this being a small world certainly ain't no lie.
A few weeks ago
I'm playing five-a-day stands in flea-bitten vaudeville houses.
Then, voom, I'm in Africa, entertaining the soldiers who chased Rommel out.
And then out of a clear blue sky
I'm hired by a handsome sheik to ride across yon burning desert sands on a secret mission.
What, change here for Schenectady?
From here you must proceed alone.
Don't tell me Paul Hendrix is out there, hiding behind one of those overgrown anthills.
Don't treat this matter too lightly,
Miss Bryce.
Two of my emissaries to Birherari have failed to return.
You don't have to worry about me.
Criminy, I mean, who in the world would suspect a gal magician with a vaudeville show that's strictly from hunger.
No one, I trust.
Oh, by the way, your friend, this Prince Selim,
- he speak the English, no?
- I think he'll be able to understand you.
Selim and I were educated in your country, at Yale.
Oh!
Boola boola, boola boola
Well, now, about this message.
Am I supposed to memorize it, or is it to be written on my back in invisible ink?
It is written within this.
Say, that's not a bad gag.
- Good luck, Miss Bryce.
- Thanks, Amir... Sheik Amir.
I'll be seeing you.
All right, boys, on your feet. Siesta's over.
Shake a leg with that java, boys.
We can't stay here all day.
If any more of my stuff falls off those camels,
I could start a magician's junkyard.
What do you want?
Because the English I so well speak,
I, Achmed Nogash Segali, by my friends to address you
- have been select.
- Shoot.
Is it true, O mystic lady, that one within this box placed may in half be sawn?
And afterward, in one piece put together be?
Well, if it isn't true, then I've died a thousand horrible deaths.
- What's on your mind, Rudy?
- This magic we wish to learn.
Oh, I get it. A free show, eh?
My friend Kushmet.
Three wives with the tempers of she-camels he possesses.
Upon two of which, the most homely, he would this strange magic perform with failure.
Thereby bending to his will the mind of the third.
Oh, brother, do you give the King's English the Saint Vitus' dance.
My friend Kushmet.
Look, Tony, rather than go through another one of your sentences,
I'll show you how it's done.
Free, gratis, for nothing.
Take the box and put it over here, fellas.
That's right.
Okay, Makushla... Kushmet, you and Charlie squatty-boo right there on the aisle.
No, Achmed, I need you for a stooge.
Now, all you have to do is when I get in here, you just saw away.
Kushmet. Couche.
- Okay, professor, saw away.
- May Allah be with you.
Oh, it's okay, Marty, it's okay.
Give her a couple of good ones.
Hey!
Hey, what goes on?
Hey, cut it out, you're clearing my pitch.
What do you think you're trying to do?
You idiot. You goggle-eyed moron!
Put me down.
Put me down!
- Girl all right?
- Of course I'm all right,
- you fugitive from a sideshow.
- Tarzan think girl hurt.
I ought to saw you in half, you meddling fool.
You've gone and chased those men off and with my horse, too.
Here I am in the middle of a desert, million miles from nowhere.
How do you expect me to get to Birherari now?
- Tarzan take.
- Oh, yes.
Well, just unroll your magic carpet and away we'll go.
Please, lady, don't be mad at Tarzan.
He was only trying to help you.
Say, what is this, a carnival act?
Ye Gods! And a monkey, too.
And unless I've got the blind staggers,
I'm looking at a horse.
Okay, Muscles, there's my Greyhound for Birherari.
Wait! Jaynar wild horse.
So what? I used to ride for a circus.
Well? How am I doing?
- Are you all right?
- Fine, fine.
I'll only spend the rest of my life eating off a mantelpiece.
You and your trick horse.
- Next time girl ask horse.
- Ask horse.
My bracelet. I've lost my bracelet.
Cheeta.
How many times must I tell you to leave other people's things alone?
Thanks.
All right. Rub your magic lamp and let's get on to Birherari.
- Tarzan stay here, rest.
- I'm not tired.
Tarzan rest.
Girl still mad.
I've never seen Jane act like that.
Jane smart. Jane know Tarzan too long.
Don't get mad.
Go away! Scat! You Mussolini, scat!
Flies, sand, mosquitoes, monkeys.
Human monkeys!
And a horse!
"Girl ask horse first."
A talking horse.
Maybe I'm crazy.
- Girl eat?
- For the 799th time, no!
- Good.
- I'm not hungry!
Besides, I wouldn't eat any of that desert duckling if I was starving to death.
Tarzan eat.
Hey! Lay off!
What's he trying to do, eat me?
The cannibal!
Hey, call him off! Don't just sit there.
Girl eat now?
Girl smart now. Smart like horse.
Okay, monkey.
Karl.
How many raiders did you say were in the party that stole the Sheik's stallion from you?
Oh, 15 at least, maybe 20.
Those?
- Well, you see, I...
- Don't strain yourself, Karl.
Nice of them to deliver the Sheik's present.
Don't tell me this is the end of the line.
Birherari.
I was afraid of that.
Well,
I've played worse places in one-night stands.
Well, goodbye, Tarzan.
Thanks for the ride, anyway.
Jaynar bring. Connie better thank him.
Yeah, that's right.
Thanks, Jaynar, old pal.
- Goodbye, Boy.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, now, Tarzan.
- Goodbye.
All right! Take a hold of that horse!
What's the trouble, Mr. Hendrix?
He stole this stallion intended as a present for the Sheik.
Man lie.
Tarzan rescued the horse.
They were whipping Jaynar.
All right, come along. You're under arrest.
But Tarzan hasn't done anything.
Has he, Connie?
What do you know about this?
Who, me? I'm just an innocent hitchhiker.
- Come!
- Tarzan!
Boy stay. Connie take good care of you.
- Me?
- Yes.
All right, if you feel that way about it.
By the way, I hope Mr. Tarzan is no particular friend of yours.
I should say not.
No, I pick my friends on the right side of the law!
Good. We'll get along, Miss...
My name's Connie Bryce.
I'm Paul Hendrix.
The big shot himself?
Well, I'm glad to meet you.
Say, where does a girl with a new family hang her hat around here?
Karl.
You'll see to it that my friend Connie and family have suitable quarters.
- I'll attend to it.
- Thanks.
- Come on, Boy. Come on, Cheeta.
- This way.
Magnificent!
- This is a gift worthy of a sultan!
- Your pleasure is my reward, Sire.
Selim, did you ever see a more superb animal?
It is a fine horse, Sire.
I'm afraid Prince Selim admires the gift a great deal more than the giver.
- There is something in what you say.
- That's enough.
You displease me very much!
Then I must humbly beg your forgiveness, Sire.
My friend, I must apologize for the manners of my son.
It is nothing. He's young, high-spirited.
- High-spirited like any thoroughbred.
- Thank you, my friend.
- Gee, Connie, I'm sure worried.
- You're worried?
Horse stealing is a mighty serious thing in this country.
- I hope they hang him!
- Connie!
I'm sorry, Boy. I didn't mean that.
But if it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be in this fix.
- Isn't there something we can do?
- Why, sure there is.
If I could just attract Selim's attention without Hendrix suspecting anything, well, we'd have Tarzan out of that clink before you could say Jack Robinson.
- Honest?
- I just said so, didn't I?
Why, it'd be a cinch.
If I had my props, I'd be out in that square doing a pitch right now.
- A pitch? What's a pitch?
- Oh, a show. An act, you know.
Fat chance I've got with all my stuff rotting out there in the middle of the desert.
Connie! I've got it!
I know how we can do a pitch.
And now, my friends, this little lady will perform a feat which has amazed the entire civilized world.
Unaided and alone, she will attempt to cross the tightwire blindfolded!
I'm sorry, Father. Really sorry.
But that man never fails to make my blood boil.
Why must you go out of your way to insult him?
I can't help it, Father. I don't like him.
- You're just prejudiced.
- No, it's more than that. He's an alien.
Haven't you noticed how he surrounds himself not with our people, but with men from the border tribes?
Why, he's employed hundreds of our people.
Yes, for the menial jobs.
But the men in his confidence, the bazaar managers, the foremen, the caravan leaders, are all outsiders.
I don't trust him, Father.
You mean, you don't trust your father's judgment, don't you?
Please, Father, I didn't mean that.
It's just that you're too good a man.
Too forthright and trusting to realize how ruthless and domineering he is.
Why, in America he'd be called a racketeer.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, this fearless little lady will attempt the daring, death-defying feat of turning a somersault on the high wire.
Watch her, ladies and gentlemen!
Watch Cheeta, the chimpanzee with the human mind, who will risk her life and limb for your edification and entertainment!
Okay, boys. Make with the music.
Boola boola, boola boola
Boola boola, boola boo<li>
Do you hear, Father?
It's a song from my university.
Well, I hear a strange conglomeration.
Excuse me, Sire.
Put faith in Eli Yale to win
We cannot fail
Boola boola boo, boola boola boo
Boola boo, boola boola boola boo
Boola boola, boola boola
Boola boola, boola boola
When we move in, oh, poor fellow
They will holler, "Boola boo"
- Nice going, chum.
- Say, where did you learn that song?
Oh, I've had a very liberal education.
I've been intercepting Yale passes for years.
You're a long way from home.
What brings you to Birherari?
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about a little later.
Fine. May I send for you this evening?
All right.
This is just so I'll know that it's your messenger.
Why all the mystery?
I'll tell you about that later.
All right, small stuff, you gotta get some shuteye.
- Shuteye?
- You know, sleep.
Oh, of course.
You sure
Tarzan's gonna be all right, Connie?
- Oh, sure, Boy.
- Then I'm sure, too.
- Good night.
- Aren't you forgetting something?
Am I? What?
Aren't you gonna say my prayers with me?
- What?
- Jane always did.
Well,
I'm a little out of practice.
You just repeat what I say.
- But I...
- Please?
- Dear Father who art in Heaven...
- Dear Father who art in Heaven...
...watch over me this night...
...watch over me this night...
...and protect me from evil.
...and protect me from evil.
Bless Tarzan and deliver him from those who would harm him.
Bless Tarzan and deliver him from those who would harm him.
Bless Jane so far away and the soldiers she nurses.
Bless Jane so far away and the soldiers she nurses.
P.S., God bless Connie, too.
P.S.,
God bless Boy, too.
Amen.
Amen.
Now you're supposed to kiss me good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, Cheeta.
Come in.
You wish an audience with Prince Selim?
Wait a minute.
Cheeta. Cheeta, give me the bracelet.
Give it to me, Cheeta.
Here, give it to me.
That's right. Thank you.
All right. Come on, Ali Baba, let's get going.
Come in.
- Well, hello.
- Hello yourself.
Still wondering how come
I sang your alma mater song?
Still wondering.
Well, a friend of mine suggested that it might be of interest to you.
An old college chum of yours.
Amir!
Well, his royal... What's his...
Sheik Amir of El Ece Bra.
How is the old so-and-so?
You know,
I haven't heard from him in months.
And yet Amir has twice sent couriers to you with confidential messages.
But I never received any such messages.
Well, wake up, chum.
There's dirty work at the crossroads.
- Somebody bumped those two guys off.
- But why?
Well, I don't know the real lowdown, but it's all here, including, I suppose, what Amir proposes to do about it.
Look.
You see, you have to press that back.
There.
I think this will finish Hendrix in Birherari.
I'll take this to my father right away.
Then my trip here has been a success.
You've taken a very great risk, and I'm very grateful.
I only wish there was something
I could do for you.
Oh, skip that.
Oh, say, you know, there is something you could do for me.
- Strictly as a friend.
- Just name it.
Well, it's about Tarzan, the jungle man, that was arrested today.
You mean the one who created such a disturbance in the square?
- But he's accused of stealing the stallion.
- Yeah, by Hendrix.
Tarzan's no thief.
- All right. I'll intercede for him.
- Thanks a million.
I'll ring for Hassan to show you out.
Oh, no. Don't bother.
I can find my way out.
- All right, Connie. Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Hendrix.
We must get that message.
- He's dead.
- He burnt the message.
Good. Saves me the trouble.
- Better call the guard.
- Call the guard?
Certainly.
There's been a murder, hasn't there?
And he practically promised to set Tarzan free.
Oh, Connie, aren't you glad now
I made you say your prayers?
I certainly am.
I think you got something there.
Why, Cheeta.
Where on earth have you been?
You're under arrest.
Under arrest? Are you kidding? What for?
For the murder of Prince Selim.
- But I just left him.
- I know that.
You were the only one who entered his quarters tonight.
You let me...
You leave Connie alone.
She hasn't killed anybody. Let me go.
We gotta help her, Cheeta.
Here. Give it to me. You'll lose it.
Come on.
...then we heard a muffled cry.
After a moment this woman ran out of the door and down the corridor.
We hurried into the room.
Prince Selim was slumped across his desk.
He had been stabbed in the back.
I didn't run out.
There wasn't a muffled cry.
They're telling a pack of lies.
The prisoner will kindly remain silent unless addressed.
- Can you confirm Mr. Hendrix's statement?
- Certainly.
As soon as we realized Selim was dead,
I called Hassan, summoned the guard.
Prince Selim did not say why he wished to speak to this woman?
No, Your Eminence.
Have you anything to say?
Only that I'm being framed!
They're trying to give me a fast shuffle!
I mean, I'm being accused of something that I didn't do!
Why did you
seek this audience with the Prince?
Well, I'd rather tell that to the Sheik. Personally.
The Sheik is in mourning for his son.
You can certainly speak freely to me.
Well, I had a note for Selim from Amir.
Indeed? And where is this note?
Well, I left it with Selim.
Did you discover any note when you examined the premises?
No, Your Eminence.
Did either of you see any sign of a note?
- I certainly didn't.
- Nor I.
Can't you see they're lying?
I suggest that this note is a figment of the murderess's imagination.
I'm afraid I'm inclined to agree.
In the name of my sheik,
I sentence you to be hanged by the neck until you're dead.
- What are you doing here?
- Please, sir, I want to see Tarzan.
- And the monkey, too?
- Please, mister.
- I can't. I've got no orders.
- But only for a few minutes.
Yeah. Well, all right, but only for a few minutes.
Thank you, sir.
Stand back.
- Why Boy and Cheeta here?
- Tarzan, they're gonna kill Connie.
- Kill? Why?
- Because she murdered somebody.
Connie? Kill someone?
No, she didn't. But they say she murdered the Sheik's son.
- Who say Connie do that?
- The same man that took Jaynar.
- And Connie says he's framing her.
- Framing?
Yes, that's American for blaming her for something she didn't do.
Why?
I don't know, but they're gonna hang her in the morning.
Open door! Open! Open door!
Stop that! Stop that or I'll shoot.
- Don't, Tarzan, he will shoot.
- Be quiet!
Quiet!
My turban!
We had more turban, we could make rope.
Slide down.
Cheeta.
Cheeta, Tarzan wants you to climb down and get lots of turbans.
Cheeta understand?
Give me my turban.
Your turban? I haven't got your turban.
- Where's my turban?
- Your turban?
- My turban!
- I haven't got your turban.
Cheeta! We thought you'd never get here.
We've got to hurry.
- Hang the murderer!
- Hang her!
Boy jump now.
Look, Tarzan, Jaynar.
Let the sentence be carried out.
Quick! Get our riders!
She mustn't escape and reach the Sheik Amir.
Boy, Cheeta, jump!
- What is it, Tarzan?
- Men near. Come!
Look! There's a hut.
Look like camel drivers' camp.
Looks like the Ritz to me.
Anybody home?
Say, this is cozy.
Look. Somebody even laid a fire.
One good thing about a whopping big storm like that, it certainly feels swell when it's over!
This is gonna make up for all that sand I swallowed.
Boy, am I relaxed!
Good to rest after struggle.
Good? It's heavenly!
You ought to see our house in the jungle.
It's really peaceful.
Boy wish he were home, eh?
Well...
Why don't you come and live with us, Connie?
Listen, you better not tempt me.
Cheeta says yes. What do you say, Tarzan?
Connie used to big cities.
Connie get lonesome here soon.
I've been lonesome all my life.
What's the matter, Boy?
Did I say something to upset him?
It's all right, Connie.
But, you see, Tarzan is lonesome, too.
For Jane.
Is that the girl you mentioned in your prayers?
Is she your mother?
- You both must love her very much.
- Of course, we do.
- Gee, she's a lucky girl.
- It's Tarzan and I who are the lucky ones.
Yeah, I suppose you are.
Everybody sleep now.
Start for medicine jungle in morning.
Connie sleep here.
That suits me just fine.
Boy sleep here.
Good night, Connie.
Good night, Boy.
Good night, Tarzan.
Good night.
- There's no one in here, Paul.
- Well, they were here.
Those hoofprints are fresh.
They've headed west.
Well, here we are.
A kid, a monkey, a horse thief and an accused murderess, all hunting for fever medicine.
Why can't you
take me to Sheik Amir now?
El Ece Bra far away. Go later.
But I want to get out from under that murder rap, and Amir is the only one who can help me.
Tarzan come for fever medicine.
Tarzan get.
Okay. Come on, kid, let's go.
Jungle dangerous.
Connie and Boy stay here.
Gee, Tarzan, I want to go with you.
I can help carry the vines.
Cheeta bring vines.
Boy help Connie fill waterskin.
- But can't I just...
- No! Tarzan hurry.
Cheeta, come!
Doesn't anybody ever win an argument with that guy?
Well, hardly ever!
Cheeta, come.
Cheeta! Come!
Cheeta, no touch flowers. Dangerous.
Come.
Stay here.
What's keeping him so long?
Every time I think of that rope necklace waiting for me at Birherari, I get the yips.
Cheeta, Connie and Boy...
Cheeta.
Connie, Cheeta's here.
You woke me up right in the middle of a nice, fat contract.
Forty weeks solid on Broadway.
Gee, Connie! I'm sorry.
That's okay, kid.
I've been having that dream for years.
Well, what do we do, now?
Squeeze the juice into the waterskin.
All right, Cheeta. Tarzan...
Goodbye, now. Hurry!
Cheeta, that's Connie's bracelet!
- Cheeta, give it to me.
- My bracelet?
Where did you get that?
Cheeta gave it to me the night they arrested you. I'd forgotten...
- Oh, wait, it's still here.
- What is it, Connie?
The note from Sheik Amir to Prince Selim.
How do you like that!
Amir is tipping the Sheik off that Hendrix is a crook and a foreign agent.
Amir says he can prove that Hendrix has been arming the border tribesmen so that he can take over the whole country.
And get this.
Unless the Sheik throws Hendrix out and disarms those border tribes,
Amir will ride on Birherari, and that will mean war.
If the Sheik reads this, he won't hang you.
He'll hang Hendrix.
You said it, kid.
This is gonna prove my innocence.
Come on.
We mustn't waste another minute.
We've gotta get this note to the Sheik right away.
What is it, Jaynar? What's the matter?
Connie! Look!
Jaynar, get out of sight.
Paul!
We gotta find Tarzan.
There they are. Come.
She's not to get away.
- You take those two men.
- Yeah.
You, come with me.
Quick, Connie. The tree.
Come on, Connie.
Connie, there.
There's another way out.
Boy!
Don't touch the web, Connie!
Don't touch it!
Connie! Boy!
Tarzan!
Connie, go!
In risking your life to bring the Sheik Amir's message, you averted bloodshed between his tribe and mine.
And I and my people will be forever grateful to you, Miss Bryce.
It was just my good deed for the day, that's all.
Well, Tarzan, old scout, what else can I do for you in London besides bringing Jane the fever medicine?
Tell Jane Tarzan very lonesome.
Send much love.
Okay, palsy-walsy!
- Goodbye, Boy.
- Goodbye, Connie.
Next to Tarzan and Jane, you're the swellest person I know.
You're 100% yourself.
Well, fellows,
I guess this is it.
So long, Tarzan! Bye, Boy!
Thanks for everything, Your Sheikness!
Tarzan and Boy go back to escarpment now.
And will I be glad to get there!
Come on, Cheeta! We're going home!
Cheeta! Where are you?
Oh, no. Not with me, you don't.
English
Look, Genevieve. Two men coming.
Let me see.
Oh, will you sell it?
Don't you understand?
Wait.
I'll get my father to buy it.
You sit down.
That's it. You wait.
Just a minute.
Oh, I forgot.
He's gone down to the fields.
Well, then, I'll have to buy it myself.
It doesn't belong to me.
Oh, well, maybe Father won't mind.
Oh, well, I can make you understand.
I have fine things.
You trade with me for that.
One, two, three.
Here, look. Very nice.
Look.
Open it.
Open it.
Very funny. Make you laugh.
Oh, my goodness.
Don't be cross. Don't go. Look.
You trade all this for that?
Oh, good!
I'm being very bad. It isn't mine.
Okay, all right.
Oh, goody! It's all mine!
Jill! Oh, Jill!
Go away! Father's coming.
Hurry! Go away!
Oh, my goodness.
Isn't he sweet?
He's better than a doll.
I can play with him.
He has to have a name.
Joe. I'll call him Joe.
Oh, Jill!
I'll surprise Father.
Be quiet.
Won't Father be surprised?
Jill.
Jill.
Where are you?
What's all this stuff?
What on earth?
Jill. Jill.
Surprise, Father. Aren't you surprised?
Jill, where did that come from?
Oh, that's Joe, Father. Isn't he sweet?
Joe? That's a baby gorilla.
Two men had him.
They didn't speak Swahili.
Really, Jill, you should have more sense.
Are you cross?
Well, for a tired man who just found a gorilla in his bed...
...I think I'm behaving very well.
You cannot have a pet gorilla.
Please let me keep him.
Please. I bought him.
How?
What did you have to buy him with?
Money and beads and toys, and other things.
Other things.
Where's my big flashlight?
Well, that makes him partly yours too, doesn't it?
I don't know what to say to you,
I'm sure.
I have worries enough trying to run this farm.
I'm sorry, but you can't keep him.
I will not raise a gorilla.
How the little fella loves his milk.
Does he always take his nap to music?
Oh, yes. This is his favorite song.
- What's the name of it?
- Don't you remember?
It's "Beautiful Dreamer."
Very appropriate.
I think he's grown already, don't you?
Oh, he'll grow, all right.
That's just the trouble.
But, Father, now I have someone to play with.
I know, dear. You're lonely sometimes.
If your mother had lived...
Baby, please try to realize that the time will come...
...when we can't keep Joe any longer.
This will always be his home, and we'll always be friends.
Listen, Jill, when he grows up, he'll be dangerous.
I know that seems impossible to you now...
...but that helpless little baby will be 10 times stronger...
...than any man in the world.
He'll weigh 7, 800 pounds.
He'll be a huge, fierce, dangerous gorilla.
Get me somebody that knows what I want.
Find me an electrician with ideas.
No, no. No, no.
I tell you, it isn't big enough.
Look, I'm branching out into new territory.
I'm building a nightclub in Hollywood.
It's got to be something original.
It's gotta knock them dead.
Take them back to the architect.
Bring me new sketches.
- What about my steamship tickets?
- Mr. Fletcher's here.
Tell Fletcher to wait.
Tell them all to wait.
I gotta shake up my press agent.
I got a letter of introduction,
Mr. O'Hara.
- What do you want?
- I thought maybe...
Well, I'd sure like to go to Africa.
So what? There you are.
Where you been, asleep?
- This is a letter of introduction.
- Half a column on page 20.
- That's good for the Times.
- This is from Tex Wood.
- Two paragraphs on the theatrical page.
- Best I could do.
I want front page!
You gotta get in there and pitch, Windy.
- These guys don't even believe I'm going.
- Can you blame them? I don't believe it.
Max O'Hara going to Africa to bring them back alive.
For what?
Why, there are 50 good animal acts...
...just begging for work right here in town.
Can't I get any cooperation?
Hey, you. What do you think?
Don't you think I ought to go to Africa?
- Why, sure.
- There. There you are. There's a smart guy.
- He agrees with you. He must be.
- This is from Tex Wood.
I don't see why you can't get front-page space, Windy.
We need a new angle.
That's what we need, a new angle.
Hello? What do you wanna talk to him about?
Oh, you wanna go to Africa.
No. No. No...
Say, who are you anyway?
That's a letter from Tex Wood.
Sure. He puts on the shows over at the Garden.
Yes, sir. Madison Square Garden.
Our show closed there last week.
- The rodeo?
- Yes, sir.
- You a cowboy?
- Yes, sir.
- Texas?
- No, sir. Oklahoma.
We rope and ride there too, you know.
I'm Gregg Johnson, champion roper.
All right. Well, what do you want here?
I saw in the paper how
Mr. O'Hara's going to Africa.
Now, there's a place
I've always wanted to see.
You reckon there's any chance he'd take me with him?
Oh, for the love of Mike. Why would he?
We're opening a nightclub, not a Wild West show.
But ain't there something I could do?
If I could just go, I might...
I got it! Hey, what's the matter with you?
What do I pay you for?
- I get all the ideas around here.
- Now what?
Got a new angle. Just thought of it.
It's great. I'll take cowboys.
- Cowboys? What for?
- To lasso lions, of course.
Maxie, you can buy all the lions you want in California.
But I'm gonna send you stories from Africa.
They'll fight to get them.
All you gotta do is pass them out.
Don't you understand? I'm gonna be in terrible danger in darkest Africa.
You're late for the dentist.
Who's the greatest press agent, you or me?
Don't answer.
Hey, you, come on.
You're gonna lasso lions.
- I am?
- Sure. Come on.
Round up some of your friends to help you.
We'll talk it over while I'm at the dentist's.
Who do you think is gonna get the worst of this, Maxie or Africa?
Hey, Ali, bring water for this lion, will you?
- He's a big one, isn't he?
- He sure is.
Just as full of fight as he was two weeks ago.
After you'd roped him, I thought for a few minutes I'd have to shoot him.
Sure glad you didn't.
That's right, Ali, give all simbas plenty maji. See?
Take the machina away.
Away.
Crawford.
Oh, Crawford!
Crawford, where are..?
Oh, there you are.
Look, I got another story to send.
Where's that telegraph office?
At Mdani, about 50 miles.
Have Gregg ride down, will you?
They don't know the way. I'll send one of the boys after they've eaten.
Let's have a spot of tea. Ahmed.
Tea. I hope this never gets back to Broadway.
I hope I never see another horse.
Well, O'Hara, we'll soon be saying goodbye.
You satisfied with the results of the safari?
Oh, sure. Just like I said, I got a million dollars' worth of publicity.
I hope your nightclub will be a great success.
As you've described it, it'll certainly be unusual.
Unusual? Look, nobody's ever seen anything like what I'm gonna give them.
I gotta get back. The date for the opening of my club is all set.
Just wondering if I've overlooked anything out here to make it bigger.
Well, I've read all the stories you've sent back...
...and I really think you've made the most of everything.
Yes, sir.
I sure made the front pages.
Oh, this is a great story I wrote today:
"How I Escaped From Pygmy Cannibals."
Pygmy cannibals? Did you really?
Was that today?
Yeah. They had me cornered.
I'd lost my gun.
They dropped a net over me from a tree.
I was fighting, struggling, but there was too many of them.
They were all over me like ants.
- How do you think I escaped?
- I have no idea.
Did I ever tell you about the mad elephant...
...that seized me in his trunk and flung me one half mile?
I went back afterwards and measured it.
You're catching on.
Hi, Gregg. How about a spot of tea, old boy, as we say in Africa.
Much obliged. I'm getting where I kind of like the stuff.
It took you six months, but you're kind of getting used to me too.
Well, I'm rapidly reaching a point...
...where nothing can surprise me, if that's what you mean.
What's the matter?
Listen.
Sorry, I must have imagined it.
I guess you thought I was a screwball at first, but my idea worked out.
Most successfully.
It's impossible. We're a hundred miles from that country.
- It is! But how can it..?
- What is it?
Ali, my gun! Big gun!
What's the matter?
- What are they saying?
- Darned if I know.
Ali, stop! Come back!
Gregg, get your men.
Slim! Boys, get your horses!
Lay off. No shooting.
Catch it. Rope it.
Are you crazy?
You can't rope a gorilla!
- Hurry up! He's getting away!
- Give me that gun!
You're crazy.
- Give me that gun!
- Don't shoot him.
Wait! You can't rope a gorilla!
Hey, where's my horse?
Stand still.
Whoa, horsey.
Cut it out, will you?
Don't do that! Don't do that!
Can't you cooperate?
There he is!
Where did he go?
He must be around here somewhere.
Hurry up, boys! Get behind him!
Get your rope ready!
Get another rope on it!
Get behind him!
Get another rope!
Look out!
Get behind him.
Get another rope!
Hey, Gregg, watch out!
Hey, Charlie, help!
No!
Hey, come here and help me!
Go on, get out there!
Get a rope on him!
Come here! Help me! Come on!
Where is he?
Don't let him get away!
Where did he go?
Help!
Help! Help!
Joe! Joe!
Help! Help!
Don't shoot! Joe, drop.
Drop it! Don't hurt him.
Don't do that.
Put him down!
Joe, drop it. Drop it, I said.
Help! Help!
- Drop it, I said!
- Help!
Joe, drop it.
What are you doing?
Why, my friend, he was getting killed.
Well, Joe is my friend, and you leave him alone.
Joe wouldn't hurt anybody.
He wouldn't if you treat him right.
Who are you, anyway?
What do you mean by this?
Well, your friend, he came into our camp.
Your camp? If it's within five miles of here, it's on my land.
This is all my property, and you keep off of it, you big bullies.
Come on, Joe.
Come on, I said.
All right, Joe.
Come on, Joe, leave them alone.
Mind me. Come along.
Joe! Come on, Joe, leave them alone.
We're going home.
Am I dreaming or did I see a gorilla and a beautiful dame?
Where did she go? Find out where she lives. I gotta talk to her.
Howdy.
Well, I reckon you're right, but I just wanna see the young lady.
I just wanna talk to the young lady.
I just wanna talk to the lady.
Afternoon, ma'am.
Seems like you always come just in time.
- What do you want?
- I'm Gregg Johnson.
I come to apologize.
With a gun?
Well, I kind of feel safer.
You were gonna shoot Joe.
But, ma'am, he had Mr. O'Hara.
If you hadn't come along, he...
- Oh, I was so frightened. Joe would've...
- He sure would.
If you'd let him alone, there wouldn't have been any trouble.
- We didn't know he belonged to anybody.
- He doesn't belong to anybody.
He lives here. Goodbye.
Wait, ma'am. Mr. O'Hara, the boss, he wants to talk to you.
- He sent me to ask you if it's all right.
- He's afraid?
Well, you can't blame him much.
Please don't be mad at us.
Well, I'm sorry, but you see,
Joe's the only friend I have.
Excuse me for asking, but where's your folks?
I haven't any.
You live here and run this place alone?
It's not so hard.
The servants and field hands all worked for my father for years.
He died six months ago.
I'm sorry.
It's a right pretty place.
I reckon this is my kind of country.
- But don't you ever get lonesome?
- Sometimes.
No, it's my home.
I've lived here all my life.
- It's beautiful. I love it. I...
- Hey, Gregg.
Tell your friends they can come out.
They don't need to be afraid.
How do you do, miss.
That gorilla around here?
Oh, don't worry.
I won't let him hurt you.
- I'm Max O'Hara. This is Mr. Crawford.
- My name's Jill Young.
Pleased to meet you, and I do mean pleased. Gregg told you we apologize?
And I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Don't mention it. Just a little misunderstanding all around.
Everything's jake now, huh?
Have I got plans for you, young lady.
Just wait till you hear.
I'll tell you all about it.
Let's sit down.
Well, come in, but no guns.
- No guns?
- No guns.
Don't you see what a great chance this is for you, honey?
Hollywood.
You must have heard of Hollywood.
- Yes, I've heard of it.
- That's where I'll open my nightclub.
I wanna make you a star.
You'll be the talk of the town.
Everybody'll be crazy about you.
You'll get beautiful clothes, have your hair fixed up. You'll be a knockout.
But I can't sing or dance or...
Who cares about that? All I want you to do is walk out on the stage.
You and Joe. Don't worry about a thing.
I got a contract here, all expenses paid.
With options, of course.
Oh, think of it, honey:
Music, glamour, bright lights, Hollywood.
You'll love it. Come on, honey, sign.
Excuse me for butting in, Mr. O'Hara.
I guess you'll be sore at me.
But, ma'am, you've got an awful pretty place right here.
Maybe you won't like it back there.
Hey, you keep out of this.
Of course she'll like it. Why not?
It sounds wonderful. I've never been anywhere. I'd love to travel.
And go to parties, have beautiful clothes.
You'll meet famous people.
You'll be famous.
Oh, quit rushing her.
Yes, you don't even give her time to think.
Say, what are you guys trying to do, stab me in the back?
That's gratitude, queering my deal.
I'm a square shooter.
I never went back on a contract in my life.
She don't even need a contract.
You take me for a cheap crook?
Think I rob widows and orphans?
I never did anybody dirt in my life.
Never in my life.
- Everybody knows that.
- O'Hara!
Why, my word's as good as my bond.
- Look out!
- Joe, stop!
Put it down, Joe.
Put that rock down.
Be quiet.
It's all right. Friends.
Joe, put that down, I tell you.
Mind me, this minute. Stop it.
Aren't you afraid of Joe?
I sure am, but I don't want him to know it.
I think perhaps you could make friends with him.
It's all right, Joe. Now, calm down.
Behave yourself. Now, listen.
That's a good boy.
Look, Joe, banana.
Will you be a good boy if I give it to you?
A banana, Joe.
Want another one? Here.
Go on, now. Go away.
Oh, boy, what an act.
I gotta sign her up.
Oh, honey, you're wonderful. Sign it.
Go on, honey, please sign it.
It's the chance of your lifetime.
What are you waiting for?
You don't wanna waste your life up in the woods like this.
Let me show you what the real world is like.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Daniels.
- Upstairs.
- And I thought you knew...
...every headwaiter in town.
- Some joint, huh?
- I'll say.
Gee, it looks just like Africa.
That's a good one.
What do you know about it?
Never even been out of the state.
Hey, I sure hope that's a thick piece of glass.
Sure it is, lady.
O'Hara had that made special.
That'll hold anything.
- Let's have a drink.
- You like to try our new cocktail?
- It's called the King of Beasts.
- He doesn't need it.
Shut up, sugar, or I'll throw you to the lions.
Lions are just darling.
I simply love them.
- You know what lions love, don't you?
- No.
Sweet little girls like you.
Oh, Micky, stop.
What do you suppose lions think about?
A drink. Maybe they're thirsty.
Poor kitty. Have a drink.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Who's Mr. Joseph Young?
How would I know?
That's Mr. O'Hara's big secret.
- Maxie's sure got a new angle.
- Yeah, but he never ran a zoo before.
He says these are the biggest lions in the world.
Sure, they would be. Leave it to Max.
- What do you suppose this set him back?
- Boy, suppose it's a flop.
Come on, drink up and go look at the show.
- Maxie, give. Who is Mr. Joseph Young?
- Give us the dope so we can turn in stories.
Yeah, we got deadlines.
Who is Mr. Joseph Young?
- You'll find out. Go on out front.
- Right this way, gentlemen.
The big show is just commencing.
- What's all the mystery?
- Tell us what it's all about.
Yeah, then we won't have to look at it.
- I'm warning you, this better be good.
- It will be. I'll join you in just a minute.
Holy smoke.
Max, I'm sick of keeping my lip buttoned.
This isn't the way we used to put over a show.
Windy, you are looking at the new Max O'Hara.
Dignified, restrained, artistic.
Classy. Go on out front.
You might learn something.
Dignified. Restrained. Artistic.
The shy type.
Hiya, Windy.
All right, Mr. O'Hara, it's about time.
All set back there? Jill ready?
How's Joe acting?
- Just fine.
- Good thing Joe likes you.
He sure does. I can handle him darn near as well as she can.
Your attention, please.
The one and only Max O'Hara.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...welcome to the Golden Safari.
I know you have all read of my exciting adventures in darkest Africa.
But I have never given out the story of the most wonderful experience of all.
That was the moment when I first met, face to face...
...the gentleman I am about to introduce to you.
But first you must meet his lifelong friend.
It is my privilege to introduce this charming young lady.
It is she alone who can completely control the amazing power...
...of the personage whose name appears in lights outside.
If you please.
This tune is an especial favorite of Mr. Joseph Young.
For the love of Mike, what's this supposed to be?
- Has Max gone nuts?
- Give it a chance, fellas. Give it a chance.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Joseph Young of Africa.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I thank you for your applause.
Here you see 10 men.
I have combed the country to find these men.
Let me introduce them.
First, Sammy Stein.
"Killer" Karl Davis.
Rasputin, the Mad Russian.
"Bomber" Kulky.
- "Slamming" Sammy Menacker.
- That's my boy!
- Max, the Iron Man.
- Wow, what a man!
- "Wee" Willie Davis.
- Look, he's got fur!
"Man Mountain" Dean.
The Swedish Angel.
The former heavyweight champion of the world...
...Primo Carnera.
Just look at them.
Every one a champion.
Look at those brawny arms, those massive chests.
I ask you, is there one creature in all the world...
...powerful enough to overcome that combination?
That is the question to which we seek an answer.
That is the test we are about to make.
When I give the signal, the fearless little lady...
...will bring my friend,
Mr. Joseph Young...
- My friend...
- Joe, stop it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.
Here, Joe, take it.
Now, boys, pull it.
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull.
Pull, Joe, pull. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull!
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe.
Pull harder, Joe. Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull!
Pull, Joe.
Joe, what are you doing?
Pick it up.
Pull, Joe.
Pull.
Help! Help! Let me go!
Help!
Let me down!
Let me down!
Go on, fella, get in.
Poor old boy.
Sorry I have to lock you up.
Well, Joe, I don't like it any more than you do.
But I reckon that's the way it's gonna be.
- Hello, where are you going?
- Jill's tired. I'm taking her to the hotel.
Jill, honey, everything turned out like I promised, huh?
- You're on top of the world.
- How..?
How long do you think you'll want us?
Don't you worry about that.
Your contract's good.
You and Joe will be working for me from now on.
Take good care of my little star, huh?
Well...
...that sounds like a long time, doesn't it?
Yeah, it sure does.
How big is he? How big is he?
How big is he?
Give me your autograph.
- That girl from Africa.
- The one with the gorilla?
Hey, how about a pass to the show?
Miss Young, my name is...
I'd like to get a pass to the show.
Go on, eat your dinner.
Lost your appetite, haven't you?
Guess I have too.
Poor old Joe. I don't blame you.
- Hello. Been mobbed again?
- Yes.
Mr. O'Hara said he'd make you famous.
- How's Joe today?
- He won't eat.
I was so stupid. I never realized he'd have to live in a cage.
Too bad.
Guess he's just too big for them.
My poor Joe, he's so unhappy.
That sign outside...
...I know just how he feels.
Ten weeks. It seems like 10 years.
Please don't cry, Jill.
Come on upstairs to O'Hara's office.
We've had enough of this.
Hello, children, come on in.
Well, we sure struck gold in California.
Business is great.
What can I do for you?
Jill's quitting.
Mr. O'Hara, Joe and I are going home to Africa.
- Are you crazy?
- Max, you talk too much.
- Now she wants more dough.
- No, it's got nothing to do with money.
- I want to take Joe back home.
- But you can't. You signed a contract.
You know that contract's no good.
She's underage.
- Hey, maybe you put her up to this.
- You keep out of this, Windy.
Look, honey, you can't do this to me.
You're throwing away good money.
You're breaking my heart.
I'm a square guy.
I told you I'd make you a star, that you'd have beautiful clothes.
You're famous.
You're all dressed up.
- I kept my promise, didn't I?
- Mr. O'Hara, I'm sorry.
I don't wanna seem ungrateful.
You've been very kind.
You think all this is wonderful.
I thought it was going to be too.
But Joe can't live in a cage, and...
...neither can I.
- Oh, honey, talk sense.
It is sense. We're not going to kill Joe.
Well, all right, if that's the way you feel, but...
But you'll give me a little time.
I mean, I've got to get another act to take your place.
I've got to protect my investment.
You wouldn't just walk out on me.
Why, of course, I...
I want to do whatever is right.
Sure you do. Now, I'm gonna take you out and buy you a swell lunch.
Just to show you there's no hard feelings.
I knew you wouldn't let old Maxie down.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Just don't rush me...
...and everything's gonna turn out all right.
You want to go,
I wouldn't try to talk you out of it.
I'd be the last person in the world that would ever...
- What's that?
- Big money for the big monkey.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...when the music starts again, start throwing your money.
One table has a lucky number.
If Mr. Joseph Young picks it up...
...it means free champagne. Ready?
Pick it up.
Pick it up, Joe.
Your cap, Joe. Take off your cap, Joe.
Stop! Stop!
Curtain.
- Who got the lucky number?
- The monkey never even picked it up.
It's a gyp. O'Hara stopped the act so he wouldn't have to give away a drink.
Cigars? Cigarettes?
Hi, babe. Sit down, join the party.
No, thank you, sir. Cigars? Cigarettes?
- Come on, sit down.
- I can't do that, sir. Cigarettes?
But, look, you've ruined my...
- Say, I'll have to pay for these.
- Shut up. Get out.
- Go on, scram. Get out.
- Run along, kid. It's okay.
Listen, you guys...
...cut out the rough stuff or I'll throw you to the lions.
Kid's cigarettes will be on your check.
Enjoy yourselves, gentlemen.
- Who does he think he is?
- Insulting us.
- This joint's dead. Let's get out of here.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I got a great idea. Wait a minute.
- I wanna have some fun.
Let's buy a drink for the big monkey, huh?
- Where's O'Hara?
- Don't worry about him, he's gone.
Come on, everybody bring a bottle.
That's a great idea.
That grouch O'Hara, let's show him we can have some fun.
Poor old monkey.
Bet O'Hara never bought him a drink.
Come on, follow me.
- You better eat something.
- I can't.
How could I let Mr. O'Hara talk me into doing that new act tonight?
He's a fast talker.
Think of me letting Joe stand up there...
...and be a target, a clown...
...for all those awful people.
I'll never do it again.
You bet you won't.
That's too dangerous.
There, you see?
I told you I could find him.
Look at him, very sad.
- He isn't having any fun.
- He needs a drink.
Make him feel good, like us.
Come on, fella. Won't you..?
Won't you join us, Mr. Young?
It's good for you. Forget your troubles.
Come on, that's a sport.
This is good stuff.
Watch me.
Good. See?
Now you take it.
Come on. Don't you wanna feel good?
Try it. It'll grow hair on your chest.
That's a boy. Come on, that's it.
- You think he'll like it?
- Of course he'll like it. Just what he needs.
Come on, try it.
He doesn't know what to do with it.
Hey, chum, watch me.
He caught on. Look at that, he drinks like a gentleman.
- Look at him pour it down.
- He likes it, all right.
Here's looking at you, Mr. Joseph Young.
- Wants more.
- Why don't you give it to him.
- I gave him mine.
- Okay, big boy.
- We're showing him a good time.
- Sure. We're good sports.
And Mr. Young's a good sport.
That's right, Mr. Young.
- Look at that, two bottles.
- Can you imagine the size of his hangover?
Oh, brother.
What a headache he's gonna have.
I'd like to see O'Hara throw him out.
Please stop worrying.
I won't let O'Hara talk you out of it.
Just to make sure that he doesn't, I'll stand on the pier until your ship is out of sight.
That's wonderful.
I wish I could make Joe understand we're really going home.
But aren't you coming too?
But if you don't, that would spoil everything.
You're always saying what a wonderful place my farm is.
You mean you don't want to go back.
Listen, Jill, you can't go around asking guys to go to Africa with you.
I don't. I'm asking you.
Well, of course I wanna go any place you go...
...but I didn't figure you felt like that. Do you?
Of course I do.
Great day in the morning.
Excuse, please.
Jumping catfish, what a thirst.
- Don't you wish you could do that?
- He's just a hog.
He doesn't leave any for us.
That's gratitude.
I'll bet you he could drink up all the liquor in this joint.
Well, I'm not gonna buy him any more.
He's drunk. Disgusting.
Listen, Mr. Young, if you can't handle your liquor, you shouldn't drink.
You drank all our good liquor, you big moocher.
- You ought to be ashamed.
- What, again?
- No, lay off, will you?
- You drank it all.
I'll teach you.
Drink all our liquor, will you?
He'll get out!
- Look out!
- Help! Help!
He's out! He's out!
Look out! Look out!
Help!
Get out of the way!
Please, don't rush! Please don't panic.
Take it easy, will you? Don't run.
Take it easy, folks.
Help!
Help! Help!
- What's happened?
- Joe's loose. He's gone crazy.
- Help me get in.
- Come on.
That ape tried to kill me.
Hear that? Police.
- They'll shoot Joe.
- Keep them out. Give me just a minute.
Joe! Joe!
Stop it!
Stop it, Joe!
Stop that, Joe. Come on.
Come on, Joe.
Please get up, Joe.
All right, break it up! Break it up!
Wait a minute, boys.
Take it easy, will you, fellas?
- Out of the way!
- Wait a minute.
Hurry, Joe.
Shooting the lions!
Joe.
Oh, no.
Your Honor...
...I’m not unsympathetic to Miss Young.
But in view of the destruction and panic already caused by this dangerous animal...
...I cannot allow sentiment to influence me.
Again, I submit that the court order should be carried out.
I'm very sorry, Miss Young, but he must be shot.
He'll never break out again, lady.
Them new bars will hold anything.
Joe...
There isn't anything I can do, Joe.
I tried.
They wouldn't listen.
Gregg and I were gonna take you back home.
It was nice back there at home, wasn't it?
Nobody hated us.
Nobody wanted to kill...
Now, lady, you don't wanna act like that.
You don't wanna be down here when they come to shoot him.
Look, you go and find O'Hara and the young fella.
They're likely upstairs in the office.
Go on, now.
That's a good girl.
Well, it's after 8:00.
Where's Schultz and his court order?
- I don't like this job much.
- It's just like shooting a mad dog.
Well, let's get it done.
I got a date tonight.
Chin up, kid.
Max has a scheme.
I don't know what, but we're not licked yet.
- But where did they go?
- I don't know.
But you can count on Max.
Those men are coming.
They'll shoot Joe.
- We've got a plan, Jill.
- We'll get Joe out.
- Get him out of the state?
- Out of the country.
- Joe's going back to Africa.
- You mean it?
Listen, honey.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
If Joe gets shot, it's my fault.
You and Joe don't belong here.
I talked you into this.
It's up to me to get you out.
I'll get you back home if I have to go to jail for it.
We paid the captain of a freighter down at the harbor.
He promised us not to sail till 6:00 in the morning.
How will we get Joe out?
There's police there.
I've got a plan.
It will take split-second timing.
We've all gotta work together.
Now, listen...
Hello, Moran.
Just came down to take my last look at poor old Joe.
Okay by me.
Just keep that girl out of here.
They'll be here to shoot him in a minute.
Too bad.
I got a lot of money tied up in you.
Goodbye, Joe.
I should have left you in Africa, where you belong.
The old heart. Help me.
Help.
Upstairs. My office.
Easy, now. Easy, now.
You'll be all right.
My office.
- My medicine.
- Take it easy, I've got you.
Good evening, O'Hara.
What's the matter, Moran?
- Why aren't you guarding the ape?
- He took sick. I had to help him.
- My heart. Sit down.
- No thanks.
- Here's the court order. We'll do the job.
- No, don't go. Wait.
- I got a date.
- I haven't read the court order.
Nothing wrong with it.
- You coming?
- No, my heart. The strain.
- Come on.
- Let's go this way. It's shorter.
This won't take long.
Getting kind of careless, aren't you, Moran?
Hey, he's gone!
Hurry, Joe, get in.
Hey, you, stop!
They got into a white van.
Get to a phone! O'Hara's office.
Schultz wants you up in my office.
Right in here.
O'Hara!
Police headquarters.
Operator. Police headquarters.
Operator, wake up! Wake up!
Schultz, here's a tip-off.
A map of Las Vegas.
- They're getting out of state.
- Here I am.
- O'Hara said you wanted me.
- O'Hara?
Operator. Oper...
- I'll get that guy! Get to a phone.
- Get to a phone.
O'Hara ought to catch up along here somewhere. Watch out for him.
Hey, take a look at this.
Get to a phone.
Turn in a general alarm.
Hold it. I hope the kids made it.
I'll take a look.
Here they come.
So long, Windy. Be seeing you.
- Step on it, Gregg.
- I gotta get some air in that front tire.
Give us some air in the left front.
Got a slow leak.
- You want I should change your wheel?
- No, I'm in a hurry.
Yeah, in a big white van, probably heading for Las Vegas.
Calling all cars. Escaped gorilla in large white van headed north.
Animal very dangerous. Shoot on sight.
Fine, it worked.
They think we're headed north.
- What happened? What was that?
- I don't know, but Joe's all right.
- Okay, Schultz, we go north, huh?
- Those roads are well covered.
That map may be one of O'Hara's tricks.
We go south.
- What you got?
- One for the tank, sarge...
...and has he got the horrors.
Running up and down the road, yelling like a banshee.
Take him back.
I'll book him when he's sober.
Now, hold on. That's my old man's lingo.
Get me headquarters.
Captain O'Toole?
This is Obrinski.
Yeah, we just got a report on the gorilla.
This is the real thing.
Calling all cars. Escaped gorilla reported at service station...
... Duane and Tilford.
Hey, that's not far from here.
Repeat. Escaped gorilla reported at service station, Duane and Tilford.
They got us spotted.
They know we're headed south.
What will we do?
Look out!
What do you think you're doing?
Wanna get us all killed?
- Who you yelling at?
- Get off of the road.
You asked for it.
- I'll move the truck.
- Jill, get Joe out.
- What's the idea?
- How much gas has he got?
Oh, I get it. Half a tank.
- Help Jill.
- Right.
- Hey, you seen a big white van?
- Sure did.
- There's something funny about it.
- Going south?
- Yeah.
- That's it.
Hurry, Joe. Hurry!
Get in, Joe. Get in.
Take that road.
It's the back way to the harbor.
I'll see you at the ship.
I hope so.
There it is.
- O'Hara. What are you doing here?
- Was I going too fast?
Come out of there. You thought you'd put one over on me, didn't you?
This is a great indignity.
I demand an explanation.
- Shut up. Open those doors.
- Wait! What are you going to do?
- Shoot that gorilla.
- It's empty.
- Don't open it.
- Get out!
Don't open it. You'll be sorry.
You'll be sorry. You'll get hurt.
Ready, boys? Open the door.
Hey, where's my truck?
Somebody stole my truck.
You smart aleck.
You got the gorilla in a truck.
- What you talking about?
- Where are they?
- Not your business.
- Come!
- Want him too?
- For what?
O'Hara, you're obstructing justice.
Where's that gorilla?
You better start talking, O'Hara.
- I think I'm gonna have a heart attack.
- Fine, have it in there.
Turn around. Back to that crossroad.
That's where they went.
I wonder how long Mr. O'Hara can hold them.
I don't know, but we better get off this road.
I wonder where that fool thinks he's going.
Hang on!
Get out, Joe.
Come on, Joe, push!
Like this, Joe. Push!
- A truck just went down there.
- That must be it.
Push, Joe! Push!
Here they come.
There's the gorilla. Shoot!
Get in, Joe!
- No, you'll hit the girl!
- Get the tires!
- Come on, you, push!
- I will not.
Go in.
Two more. Two more children upstairs.
Jill!
Jill!
Children, where are you?
Jill!
Gregg!
Gregg!
Get to the roof.
Joe!
Joe!
Joe! Joe!
Joe, in here.
Joe!
Gregg!
Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
Look!
Go back, Joe. Go up.
There's a baby up there, Joe.
Go up, Joe. Joe, go up.
My poor Joe.
It's all right, kid. There's nobody in the world gonna shoot Joe now.
No, no, no. It isn't big enough.
Max O'Hara, I didn't know you were back in New York.
Read the paper.
I've been back for months.
Hi, Max. I got 200 girls for you to look at.
They'll be at the pool tomorrow, 10:00.
- They all gotta swim like fish.
- Sure.
It'll be the greatest water show.
Singers, dancers, jugglers, acrobats...
...all in the water.
- I can get you a great act.
- It could work on a raft.
- What?
- Monkeys.
- Nix. Cut it out, will you? See you later.
- Hey, what is this?
- I got a big surprise for you, Maxie.
What is it? Hurry it up.
I got a million things to do.
You've got time for this.
Wait till you see it.
Hey.
Look at that.
The kids told me to spring it on you.
Crawford took it.
He went up there to visit them.
Hi, Jill.
Hello, Max.
Hey, they said, "Hello, Max."
And they lived happily ever after.
I sure hope so.
They will. They're back home where they belong.
Extra! Oregon State invites Duke to Rose Bowl!
Extra!
Late edition!
Oregon State invites Duke to Rose Bowl.
What is he saying?
Oh, Oregon State face
Duke University football in a Rose Bowl.
An incident of great national importance.
Late edition!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
We should like to see some leather paper.
Certainly.
For business use or personal?
Personal.
Here's a handmade paper.
I have it in several different colors.
Now, let's see.
Hey, here we are.
- Got white, buff...
- White will do.
Very good, sir.
- Do you want your name on it?
- Yes, of course.
- Name?
- Frank Griffin.
- Griffin?
- Yes, Frank Griffin.
It should be familiar to you.
Should it?
It's your name.
Your real name.
Well, this ought to be cozy.
I'd just like to talk to you,
Mr. Griffin. Please be seated.
Surely.
Now, I tried to find you for many years.
Would you mind informing Mr. Griffin that it was I who found him?
Well, I'm flattered, gentlemen.
But what can I do for you?
We want to pay you.
Pay me?
Yes, Mr. Griffin, we want to pay you.
Yes, a fortune.
I'm sure you don't owe me anything, and nothing I have to offer is worth a fortune.
Oh, now, come, Mr. Griffin, there's no need for you to be modest, especially with us.
All we want to buy is your father's formula, or was it your uncle who discovered it?
No, no, no.
It was his grandfather, Frank Griffin.
Yes, yes, of course.
Frank Griffin Sr., shot by the police.
How fantastically romantic.
You know you could make a million with your grandfather's formula.
Now, look, gentlemen,
I'm not good at riddles and...
Your grandfather discovered a drug.
Injected into a man's bloodstream, it rendered him transparent.
Invisible.
People treated with this drug are sometimes dangerous.
They have to be liquidated.
But, if they are controlled, they can become very useful to any country at war.
You do have the drug in your possession,
Mr. Griffin, don't you?
I'm prepared to offer you any sum that you like to name.
But why come to me?
Oh, why make things difficult,
Mr. Griffin?
We came with the best of intentions.
But you're going to put us through great deal of unnecessary trouble.
Search the place.
Now, wait a minute.
What right have you to...
This right.
Very obstinate young man, huh?
What makes you think
I have this drug?
This shop, your false name.
Granted such a drug exists, do you think the world is ripe for such a discovery?
That is the common chatter of a man poisoned by the ideology of a decadent democracy.
Weapons are created to be used.
There's no place for the weak on this Earth.
- Typical German philosophy.
- Precisely.
German thinking is the clearest in the world.
As a graduate of Oxford,
I can testify to that.
It was German logic that led us to you.
Now, will you be kind enough to tell us where it is?
Or why don't we make him tell us?
Well, are we going to have to resort to force?
Oh, I see.
German logic.
If I did have such a drug, surely you don't think I'd keep it here.
You're not a very convincing liar,
Mr. Griffin.
Perhaps we can loosen your tongue.
Why, you...
This is really a very useful machine.
You know, if a person weren't careful, it could cut off his fingers or his whole hand.
Very handy machine, huh?
Handy, isn't it?
Take him over there!
Put his fingers in here.
Why, you...
Come, come, Mr. Griffin, while there's still time.
This won't help you much.
No?
The choice is yours.
Stop. I'll tell.
You were right.
Let me have it now.
Come.
Let him go.
I told you it was a very useful little machine.
Men who attacked you were foreign agents,
Mr. Raymond.
Or should I call you,
Mr. Griffin?
- I'd like to forget that name.
- I understand.
Since you're unwilling to let the Axis powers use your formula, will you consider submitting it to the American government?
Naturally, we've known about you for some time but respected your incognito.
However, since that's been exposed, we deem it a highly patriotic service if you would permit us to use the drug.
There's no use asking me.
I should have destroyed it years ago.
But if your country had great need for it, a critical emergency?
There will never be an emergency critical enough to justify its use.
Never.
May I present Mr. Raymond.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Raymond.
- Glad to know you. Glad to know you.
- Thanks.
Gentlemen, Mr. Raymond has decided to turn it over to us.
However, there is one condition.
The drug is to be used by no one but myself.
But, Mr. Raymond, we have men of experience who have been chosen for just such a task.
Does Mr. Raymond realize the danger of this mission?
And are you, gentlemen, fully aware of the danger in using this drug?
I'm the only one who knows its potency.
It may cost the life of the man who uses it.
It's true I may not have the experience, but I won't come back without the information you want.
Sometime ago,
I refused you the use this drug.
Well, now I offer not only the drug but myself.
Together, we will bring back what you want.
- But Mr. Raymond, you...
- A man of conviction is often more to be desired than a man of experience.
I should like to think it over.
There's no time for that.
We must make a decision immediately.
I'm inclined to think
Mr. Raymond is equal to the task.
You have my confidence, sir.
Gentlemen, I move to assign the job to Mr. Raymond.
Well, gentlemen?
- I agree.
- Go ahead.
Thank you.
Now, tell me what I have to do.
We know the enemy is planning a nationwide sabotage effort, an all-out attempt to wreck this country's war productions.
It is imperative to all of us to know the exact date when Germany will strike.
- By what means.
- And through what agents.
And who would have this necessary information?
Hitler and the Gestapo, the Secret Police.
Well, we've no time to lose.
Speed is essential.
- I'm ready to go now.
- Excellent.
Well, we shall carry you to London and then to Berlin.
We'll be over Berlin in a minute, old boy.
Now, all I have to do is get in touch with our agents there.
Arnold Schmidt, carpenter.
Gärtner Strasse 22, right?
Tell him you want to buy a coffin, empire style.
Altitude 4,005.
- Where is he?
- In the barn, you fool.
Come out, or I'll shoot!
No use hiding!
Come out of there!
Come out!
You can't get away!
Surround the barn.
- He lost his shoe, sir.
- I find this shoe, sir.
- He can't go far without his shoes.
- I find this, sir.
He can't get far without his...
He can't get far!
We couldn't find him, sir.
- He's gone, sir.
- He disappeared.
Are you crazy?
- We saw him...
- And then we didn't.
He dissolved in the air.
You are crazy!
Go back and report there is a British parachutist at large.
Ask them to send a company of men.
We must search the countryside.
I want to order a coffin, empire style.
Where are you?
Over here, but I'm practically frozen.
This is...
This is amazing.
Well, they told me to expect an invisible man, but this is like a...
Like a miracle.
How about some hot coffee, huh?
Oh, if I can be...
May I have another?
Sure, sure, sure.
It's... It's amazing.
Oh, you will be of great help to us.
Maybe. We'll see.
Now, where do we start?
There is a young lady at Wannsee, Park Strasse 9.
She knows the right people.
Make all your reports to me,
- and I'll see that they get to England.
- Mmm-hmm.
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.
Just the girl's name.
Maria.
Remember to give her the password.
You have the address?
Wannsee,
Park Strasse 9.
How far is it?
Uh, about 70 kilometers.
Hmm. That calls for transportation.
Have you got any around here?
Usually there is a cab in front of the restaurant across the street.
Good.
Will you please send a taxi to Wannsee, Park Strasse 9?
Park Strasse 9 in Wannsee.
Yeah, yeah.
For you, Emil.
Park Strasse 9 in Wannsee.
Uh, here. Take over.
Play like you were losing your own money.
The taxi you ordered.
Taxi? We didn't order a taxi.
I got a call to come out here.
I'll ask Ms. Sorenson.
Just a minute.
Come in, Gretl.
There's a taxi cab driver out here, ma'am.
He said somebody telephoned him to come here.
I certainly didn't.
It must have been a mistake.
That's what I told him.
Who is that?
Don't be alarmed.
You can't see me, so I thought it only fair to switch off the light.
It puts us on equal terms.
Where are you?
Right here in the room with you.
- Oh.
- Don't go.
Then show yourself.
If I could, you'd be surprised.
Mind if I smoke?
My first cigarette in days.
Oh, forgive me. I didn't realize the winters in Germany were so severe.
They told me
I'd find help here.
This is ridiculous.
Now, if this is a practical joke,
I don't consider it at all funny.
Well, now, wait a minute.
I was sent here in empire style.
Empire style?
Oh, really?
This is fantastic.
Probably, but the explanation is simple.
You see, I have a certain chemical in my veins.
Well, it takes the color out of my whole body.
Are you insane?
No, just transparent.
You wouldn't call a window insane, would you?
Just believe me.
I'm simply invisible.
Otherwise, I'm like any other normal human being.
How can I help you?
Well, by putting me in contact with a source of certain information.
Who are you?
My name is Raymond,
Frank Raymond.
Oh, yes.
I've been 36 hours getting here, and I'm tired and dirty.
Do you mind if I use your tub?
Really I wish you'd choose another time.
- Why?
- It's dangerous.
I'm expecting a guest for dinner.
Someone interesting?
Oberst Heiser of the Secret Police.
Excellent.
You work fast, don't you?
I'm sure you'll find the gentleman extremely interesting.
A bath and a tenderloin steak.
Those are the high points of a man's life.
Quite charming.
Three people having dinner for two.
Yes, three on a steak.
Here he comes.
Be there in a minute.
Good evening, Karl.
You are looking magnificent.
Thank you.
I...
I couldn't wait to be with you...
Alone.
No, Karl.
I feel much safer with him to chaperone us.
You ought to forget about him, Maria.
Oh, Karl.
Missions like his take time.
Sometimes, a lifetime.
He never told me why he left.
Oh, he never told anyone.
He has his own ideas.
And that's dangerous.
The Führer doesn't like people who think their own thoughts.
I hope you will be satisfied with what my cook has to offer.
Think nothing of it.
I brought a little snack from my meager rations.
- Cheese.
- From Holland.
- Champagne.
- From Occupied France.
Moët & Chandon, 1929.
Fowl from Denmark...
Oh. and lobster from Norway.
Delicious.
Oh.
Every country we conquer feeds us.
And these are just a few of the good things we'll have when this war is over.
- Caviar.
- From Russia.
Very difficult to get.
Slaves working for us everywhere while we sit back with a fork in our hands and a whip on our knees.
Oh.
That's strange.
Very strange.
Um...
Sorry, Karl,
I couldn't wait.
- More champagne, please.
- Of course.
Now, let's drink to the golden age of the German Reich.
To the people who are bound to win the war.
Not chilled enough.
Excuse me.
Guard.
- Bring a wine bucket.
- Heil Hitler.
Frank. Shh.
- How do you like him?
- Who?
Your new bodyguard.
I'd feel better if you'd accept his protection.
Why, Karl, I...
I never realized
I was in danger.
Beautiful women are always in danger.
- Oh.
- Always.
Yes, always.
Shall we...
- Yes?
- ...eat?
Of course.
Oh. I forgot the jam.
Now, let's see.
Where did I put that?
Plum, apple,
- strawberry.
- Ah, here it is.
Specially prepared for me.
Gooseberry.
Oh. Place it over there.
And I don't want to be disturbed under any circumstances.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil.
I was...
That's strange.
I was sure you had put some chicken on my plate.
Maybe you'd eaten it already.
Oh, have I?
I really mustn't eat so fast.
I'll give you some more.
That wing.
It really looks delicious.
Yes, and some potatoes.
Mmm-hmm.
That's fine.
That will be enough for a while.
You know, I'm overworked.
A three-hour conference with the Führer nearly killed me.
Now, Karl, don't tell me the Führer conferred with you personally.
Of course, he did.
If you had said he had conference with Göring or Ribbentrop,
I might believe you, but not...
But I tell you the Führer called me in himself just before he left for the eastern front.
He gave me secret orders.
Nobody there.
Just him and me.
Oh, let's forget about politics.
But I tell you it's true.
He's ordered an attack upon the United States.
How can we attack the United States 4,000 miles away?
To the Führer, no place is too far away, not even the United States.
He's even fixed the date.
- The date?
- Mmm-hmm.
Really? When?
Let's forget politics.
Some day, you'll be the most important man in the party.
You have the strengths of Göring, the vitality of Goebbels, and the shrewdness of Hess.
I wouldn't be surprised if you became the Führer's successor.
Well, if you're so sure of my future, why don't you...
Why don't you have some lobster?
You've hardly eaten anything.
I cannot understand why Stauffer ever let the Gestapo train you for such risky work as spying, flying planes, shooting guns, intelligence work.
No, that's not work for a beautiful girl.
I'd never send you on such dangerous missions.
I'd keep you with me always.
Maria, you set my blood afire...
I must have pushed it with my foot.
Too bad.
- It will dry.
- Huh?
Come on. Sit down, and eat your lobster.
Oh, well.
Maria, why...
Why don't you forget about Stauffer?
After all, there's such a thing as carrying loyalty too far.
Oh.
You hurt yourself.
Something pushed my hand.
Poor Karl, trying to eat with his nose.
Poor darling.
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Oh.
Maria, I...
You don't have to laugh.
I really don't understand.
If you had a brain in your head, you'd stop that silly giggling!
Did you hurt yourself?
This is an insult to the entire Nazi party.
But, Karl, I was only laughing at your tricks.
Laughing, eh?
I've had people shot for less.
- Guard!
- Oh, but...
Ms. Sorenson, consider yourself under house arrest.
This woman is not to leave the house.
So be on the watch.
For what, sir?
I don't know, but watch her.
But, Karl...
You messed up everything.
I'm sorry.
Too much champagne on an empty stomach.
He was just going to give us the information we wanted when you started...
Well, he was getting far too familiar with you.
But we can't let our personal feelings interfere.
A whole year's work destroyed in a few minutes.
What are we going to do now?
You'll just have to turn on the charm again, darling.
And if I'm any judge of men, he'll be calling on you soon.
What makes you think that?
Well, you're an irresistible woman.
- Who is it?
- Open up!
Open the door, or we bring it down!
Don't you dare come into my bedroom.
You better let them in.
What do you want?
- Who were you talking to?
- Myself.
Now, get out of here, or I'll report you to Oberst Heiser.
That was a man's voice we heard.
- How dare you?
- Oh.
- Why, you...
- Fritz!
Let her alone.
- She kicked me in the stomach.
- Come on.
Remember, she's Stauffer's friend and Heiser's.
Oh, don't let them get you down.
They treat women like dogs.
I hate them.
Forgive me.
Oh, I wish I could see you.
Very well, then you shall see me.
I'll have to use some of the things on your dressing table.
- Do you mind?
- Please do.
Ah, this ought to help.
Oh, you are rather tall, aren't you?
Six, one-and-a-half, when I get my head on.
I could sure use a towel.
In the right-hand drawer.
I could use these, too.
Is it all right?
- Surely. Go ahead.
- Thanks.
I've seen women do this somewhere.
Remember now,
I look better invisible.
Oh, you're in for a shock.
Oh.
I warned you.
Well, how do you like your invisible man with a cold cream face?
Have you always been invisible, or will the drug wear off?
It might in time.
Oh, but it's such a powerful drug.
Isn't there danger in using it?
Under the present circumstances, there's danger in not using it.
I'm tired.
This drug puts you to sleep at the most unpredictable times.
Oh, if I could only close my eyes for a few minutes.
Frank. Frank, you mustn't fall asleep here.
It's dangerous.
Yes, I know, but it feels so nice, just like drifting.
- Frank, please don't.
- Shh.
I won't make a sound.
Just a little nap.
Frank. Frank!
Come in, Heiser.
Come in, and close the door.
I... I'm delighted to see you back, sir.
I can imagine.
"Countryside search for parachutist is not yet found.
"Clothes discovered, but his description not available.
"Questioning of searchers revealed nothing.
"Eyewitnesses claim they saw the parachutist dissolve in mid-air."
What do you make of that?
I've had the officers in charge arrested.
They'll be tried in military court, of course.
It's clearly nothing, but incompetence.
Baron Ikito, may I present to you Lieutenant Heiser.
- Heil Hitler!
- Huh? Oh. Heil Hitler.
Baron, we have a long trip behind us.
Yes, it was a long trip.
I'm sure you must want to rest.
As the rising sun never sets, so we servants never sleep.
Forgive me, but I have a call to pay, uh, a private call.
I quite understand, sir.
Having looked at nothing but the skies, the waters, and me, your appetite for privacy no doubt is on edge.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
What have you done to your uniform?
Oh, I...
I was with Ms. Sorenson, having dinner.
Dinner?
Did you eat it, or bathe in it?
I really don't know what happened, sir.
The food seemed to creep up on me.
Really? The first time you interest me.
What interfered with your gastronomic pleasure?
I... I couldn't say, sir.
There I was, behind the table, and suddenly it began to...
Frank. Frank, please wake up.
Frank.
Conrad, you're back.
The warmth of your welcome overwhelms me.
What's been going on between you and Heiser?
I resent you storming into my bedroom, and I resent your question.
Will you both leave at once?
This modest indignation does not suit you, Maria.
You dined with him, didn't you?
You told me to take care of her, and I have.
Like a father.
You appear to take liberal views as to the duties of a father.
I'm a loyal party member, and I won't be treated in this fashion.
The Führer himself gave me his orders.
So you already wormed your way up there?
Fast work.
A little too fast.
I only did my duty.
I read the reports on you.
I know every move that you made while I was away.
You tried to get my job.
You even tried to squeeze me out here.
- You misunderstand, sir.
- I understand you only too well.
At least you didn't get my job.
- But really, sir, I...
- Your hopes were premature.
You are an enemy of the party, Heiser!
Guard.
This man is under arrest.
Take him to the Stasi prison.
Why did you have to arrest him here?
Did you need me as a witness?
It's good for you to see your friends arrested.
Hardens you.
There's no place in our new order for sentimentalists.
Do you really think
I could be sentimental about Heiser?
He hasn't been loyal to anyone.
He's ripe for an accident.
Perhaps a sudden attack of appendicitis, and he might not recover from the operation.
Conrad, people aren't going to be taken in forever by these operations where the patient always dies.
Darling, you don't know how ill my patients really are.
As a matter of fact, you're looking rather pale yourself.
Don't expose yourself.
You might catch something fatal.
Is that all?
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you.
I must get back to my office.
Ribbentrop is sending me a file of secret orders in connection with our work in the United States, in which you play an important part.
Thank you.
I'll do my best.
I'm sure you will.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Frank.
Frank.
Where are you, Frank?
No jokes, please, Frank.
Good morning.
Don't hide, Mr. Griffin.
Won't you do any good.
I saw you holding that book.
You don't waste your time.
Shall I call the guards in now, or can we talk this over like gentlemen?
Why, Mr. Stauffer.
Four stories high, no fire escape.
I wouldn't jump if I were you.
You might break every invisible bone in that poor invisible body.
You are a very clever man, Mr. Stauffer.
Uh-huh.
Now, I think we can come to an understanding, or shall I turn on the heat as you say in your country?
That's a very good idea.
It is rather cool.
Will you do me a favor?
Sit down and rock.
I shall feel safer if I know you're not standing behind me.
Oh, by the way, that book that you were reading just now is a list of the German-Japanese agents in the United States.
You walked right into our trap.
"Our trap"?
When I told Maria about the secret papers in my office,
I knew that you were there.
I felt sure that you'd snap at the bait.
Keep rocking.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
- Or a drink perhaps?
- No, thank you.
Now, Mr. Griffin, since you are in no position to bargain,
I suggest that you hand over that formula.
We'll make it well worth your while.
Money doesn't interest me.
My living expenses have dropped to nothing lately.
No, I wasn't thinking about money.
I'll let you keep what you already have.
Your life.
Keep rocking.
Unfortunately,
I can't oblige you about the drug.
I don't know the formula myself.
Very well then.
You force me to use methods that I had hoped to avoid.
Is this where we stop being gentlemen?
Guard!
Hurry.
Oh! You...
Hurry. Hurry!
Guards! Guards!
Guards, stop him!
Don't let him get away.
Help! Help!
Send the fire department.
Guard that door.
Guards!
Now, steady, men.
Watch him.
Careful.
Steady, now.
Don't let him get away.
Look out!
Get up, you stupid fools.
Now, don't let him get away.
Mind that corner.
Steady.
Look out!
Is this the coffin
I ordered empire style?
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
You've got to radio this to England at once.
What's that?
The German-Japanese agents in America?
Right, and now I know where to get the information we're really after.
Every second counts.
I had better send this at once.
Mmm-mmm! Boy, this is spooky. Wow.
Hello.
Hello.
This is the man with the cold cream.
I just wanted to know if you were still interested.
Of course,
I'm still interested.
More than ever, but you needn't bring it.
I'll come take it myself.
We deliver free of charge, you know.
Who is it?
The Führer.
- Heil, Hitler.
- Heil.
No, no, that's not it.
The brown leather binding. You must find it.
I happened to hear about your friend
I came to express my regrets.
Thank you, Baron.
Allow me to congratulate you on the speed of your news service, Baron.
One minute sooner, and you'd beaten the fire engines.
And perhaps caught Griffin.
Tell me, sir, that book listing our agents in the United States
- is still in your possession, of course?
- Of course.
You see, when you asked me to let you have that book, you promised to guard it with your life.
And you know, of course, that should the names of so many of our loyal agents fall into the wrong hands, it would cost me my life.
Really? How interesting.
Your life?
Certainly. In my country, when a man makes a mistake...
Uh, would you mind showing me that book?
As only one copy exists, its safekeeping would comfort me.
Unfortunately, other people's comfort is not my strong suit, Baron.
Oh.
May I remind you that though we are Axis partners, you are still on German soil.
Our code demands that we do only what we consider best for our own welfare.
I see. And at the moment, my welfare is not related to yours.
You are very discerning, Baron.
I cannot allow my judgment to be influenced by consideration of your welfare.
That is your decision?
I'm sure that you won't mind my informing the Japanese government about your unique handling of our affairs.
Do what you like, Ikito.
But you are still in Germany.
I've never been more aware of it.
Yes?
A number on Gärtner Strasse just called Ms. Sorenson's house.
Gärtner Strasse?
- A man selling cold cream.
- Cold cream?
Give me Gestapo headquarters.
Pig's fat.
Just the dish for this pig.
He's been stuffing himself with caviar long enough.
Get up!
Get up when you're spoken to, swine!
Attention!
Here's your food.
I'm not hungry.
Because it isn't lobster?
Eat it!
Eat it!
How do you like it?
That's what we get on our ration cards.
You're only getting what you deserve, Heiser.
Who's that?
What? Where are you?
You've sent thousands of innocent people into these rat holes.
Now you're in one yourself.
In a few hours, you'll be shot.
You know how it'll happen.
Exactly how.
You've given the order yourself too often.
Guard!
Guard!
What do you want?
There...
There's somebody in my cell.
You...
But... But I heard a voice.
They all do in this place.
You won't be hearing it long.
Did you think those murders would help you?
You're as good as dead, Heiser.
I'm losing my mind.
Most of your victims were driven insane before they died.
- The way you'll die tonight.
- Stop. Stop it!
You're going to die, Heiser.
You're going to pay for just one of the crimes you've committed in the name of your party to cover up your own greed and brutality.
Your kind just doesn't kill men.
You murder their spirit.
You strangle their last breath of hope and freedom so that you, the chosen few, can rule your slaves in ease and luxury.
You're a sadist just like others, Heiser, with no resource but violence and no feeling but fear, the kind you're feeling now.
You're drowning, Heiser, drowning in the ocean of blood around this barren little island you call a new order.
One of your own gang pushed you off.
Someone else will push him off.
And that's how you'll all go, killing your own.
Dog eating dog until only the biggest and the hungriest are left.
You were a little dog, Heiser, and they're pretending you're mad so they can shoot you tonight.
Who are you?
I can't see you.
I'm right beside you.
Where? Where?
Right here, in your cell.
In my cell?
That's impossible.
I can't see you.
But I can see you quite clearly.
You're touching your forehead.
Now, you're loosening your collar.
Yes, I can see and hear everything you do.
I can go wherever I please without restriction.
And if I want to,
I can even free you.
Free me?
Please, please.
I don't want to die.
Get me out of here.
Get me out of here, and I'll do anything.
Anything.
All you have to do is answer one question.
Just ask me. Please, ask me anything.
What are the plans for attack on America?
Well, I'll tell you.
We're sending bombing planes over New York, all suicide squad, while our agents will sabotage
American industry.
At the same time, they will destroy public utilities.
Well, that's a pretty big job.
Oh, we've been preparing for years.
Yes. They only await the word.
Now, now I've told you, now get me out of here.
You promised, you know, to take me out of here.
What is the date of the attack on New York?
Uh,
I'll tell you that as soon as I'm free.
You'd better speak up now.
I'll tell you, I'll swear, but not before...
You'd leave me here,
I know.
You, Nazis.
I pity the devil when you boys start arriving in bunches.
Guard, the key to open Heiser's cell.
Stay here.
- They're coming.
- The date, Heiser.
- They're coming to kill me.
- The date, Heiser.
Tonight.
It starts tonight.
A hundred bombers leave from Tempelhof for New York.
Save me.
Save me. I'll tell you everything about our whole spy network.
Do you hear me?
Save my life.
You can't let me die.
You need me.
What's he yelling about?
What are you doing, Heiser?
- Broadcasting to England?
- No. No, don't shoot. I...
I have something to tell you.
Save your breath, Heiser.
We know enough already.
Hurry up.
Put on his overcoat.
Come on.
We've got to move.
I thought you wanted to get out of here.
Turn up your collar.
Come on.
I'll take the gun.
We'll be at the airport in 20 minutes.
I've got to make a stop first.
22 Gärtner Strasse.
We can't. I've got to get out of this country before Stauffer catches up with me.
And be shot down by the British? Oh, no.
We'll radio them first that we're coming over in a German plane.
Oh.
Escaping from the Gestapo so that I can get killed by the RAF.
What a joke.
Well, I've got to get out of these clothes.
And you still don't remember who talked in your telephone?
Answer me!
I didn't see anyone come into my shop.
That's precisely what I've been waiting for.
Precisely.
I believe you.
And the short-wave radio set in your chimney, of course, you'd know nothing about that.
Dozens of people live in that place.
I'm... I am a carpenter.
I don't know anything about the radios.
Of course.
The car back there.
Secret police.
They're watching that Schmidt place.
Wait right here.
Schmidt. Schmidt.
- Frank.
- Maria.
- Where is Schmidt?
- I don't know.
What are you doing here?
The Gestapo was listening when you telephoned.
The wires were tapped.
Oh, I get it.
You double-crossed him, and now you'd like to get me.
You're playing both sides.
Spying for the Nazis and pretending to be our friend.
No. I came to warn you.
To lay another trap, as you did with the help of Stauffer.
Your role is quite obvious.
Oh, Frank, how can you talk like this?
Well, they won't get me.
- But, Frank...
- Stay where you are.
I've got to get out of here.
Don't leave me.
Take me with you to England.
How did you know
I was going to England?
- I didn't, but...
- So the trap was all set, eh?
Oh, Frank, how can you talk like that?
If I weren't on your side, would I be here?
I'm not so sure.
Frank, please try to understand.
Oh! What's this?
It's full of hooks.
Oh, they're tearing into me.
- Why?
- Frank.
Oh, can't move.
No, don't touch me.
- You'll make the hooks go deeper.
- Oh.
- Oh, I knew you told them.
- No! I didn't!
Here.
Did you see those Japs go into the shop?
No, why do you suppose?
Let's find out.
You follow the hearse.
She's gone. She must have been in one of those coffins.
What about the second coffin?
Who would they have in that?
There's no telling.
Psst.
Where are you?
Come out.
There's nobody here.
I... I can't leave without you.
You've got to notify the British we're coming, or they'll shoot our plane down.
Where are you?
Sign this.
What is it?
Our common form of release.
It merely states that you've been well treated, and no one has harmed you.
- I can't sign it.
- You won't?
I can't.
You've broken my fingers.
You...
Hello.
- For you, sir.
- Take him away.
Yes.
Listen, Stauffer, this is Heiser.
I've got to talk to you.
It's a matter of life or death.
It's Heiser. Trace this call.
I'll keep him talking.
Wait. Track him down and shoot him on sight.
My dear fellow, it's good to know that you're safe.
There's been a frightful mistake.
Stop fencing, Stauffer.
I'm leaving right now, so there's no use sending your killers here.
Heiser, pull yourself together.
I'm not sending anybody after you. I give you my word.
Oh, stop lying.
There's more at stake than our personal grudge the Fatherland is in danger.
Now listen.
There's an enemy spy at large, an invisible man.
An invisible man?
Where is he?
Will you give me your word as a national socialist that you'll reinstate me if I tell you?
Of course. You proved your value.
The Fatherland needs you.
Where is this invisible man?
Meet me at the corner of Wilhelm Strasse and Koch Strasse.
It's important, Doctor, that our prized fish here doesn't die.
Not yet.
He will not die, Baron.
Not from fishhooks.
Cut the rest away.
- Naturally, he has lost some blood.
- Oh, naturally.
But we can remedy that.
Fascinating.
What on earth could it be that makes him invisible?
Our chemist will know the answer soon.
- What have you done to that girl?
- Look, look, look.
So happy to hear you speak again, Mr. Griffin.
I can't tell you Japs apart, but that voice of yours haunts me.
Where is that girl?
Well, she's quite well,
I assure you.
I don't want assurances.
I want proof.
Now, let me see her.
It so happens, Mr. Griffin, that I'm in a mood to bargain.
Now, you let me have the drug and...
Listen, I'm not giving up anything.
- Unless...
- There's nothing you and your chemist can do anything about it.
Where's the girl?
Occidental decay is nowhere more apparent than in that childish sentimentality.
White men for their women.
I assume you demand the safety of this woman in return for your collaboration.
Well, I anticipated your wish.
The lady will be set free the very moment
I learn the secret of your transparency.
I believe you implicitly.
As a member of the German Secret Police,
I protest you holding me by force.
Maria.
You do understand, madam, that extraordinary circumstances justify unusual measures.
I have orders from the Gestapo to detain this man.
- Oh.
- You'll turn him over to me at once.
Very sorry, madam, that's impossible.
Duty compels me to take this rare specimen to my own country.
Oh.
You double-cross your own ally.
Our alliance is desirable only as long as it serves Japan.
Tell them to guard the doors.
Hurry up.
Oh, he's fainted.
Take him out of this room.
Take that woman out, too!
Get them both out of here.
Let me go. Help!
- Frank!
- Here, right here.
Now, keep out of sight.
May I remind you, sir, that this embassy is Japanese's territory.
Only so long as it suits our purpose, Baron.
They're getting away!
After them!
Move! Hurry!
Get up!
Don't waste any time.
Wait a minute, sir.
Griffin escaped.
You won't.
You failed, Stauffer.
We both failed.
No.
I'm going to make an honorable man even out of you.
Now, I am his successor.
I am the power.
The airport quickly.
- There he is.
- Heiser.
Back up. Back up.
We're going to England.
- England?
- Yes.
I've got some vital information that must get there before midnight.
What?
And thanks to your
Nazi friends for training you so well.
You're going to fly us.
Faster! Faster!
Look out!
Come on.
Get going.
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.
Call in the aircraft!
They should shoot that plane down!
Well, what are you waiting for?
Get after it!
There's a British spy in that plane!
Circle around a minute.
These planes are going to bomb New York.
I can't stop them, but I bet
I can slow them down.
That ought to hold them for a few hours.
Thank goodness for the clouds.
- You better put on a parachute.
- Good idea.
I'm going to set the automatic pilot and put these on.
Heiser!
Head straight for England.
Boy, I feel kind of high.
We're going higher so that their pursuit planes can't get us.
Wish I knew how to work this radio so I could let the British know we're coming.
I'll send them a message.
Oh, no, you won't.
What do you think I am? Stupid?
- But, Frank, if...
- We're still over the continent, and I don't trust you.
Probably, let the Nazis know our position.
Enemy plane bearing west, northwest.
Let me use the radio now.
- Enemy aircraft! On the go!
- Commence firing!
Do you want the British to shoot us down?
Take the control.
Frank.
Frank.
Wake up, Frank!
Frank, please wake up.
Look at the blightly.
He has no head.
So he has.
Good morning, Raymond.
How are you feeling?
Oh, hello, Sir Alfred.
Hmm, not bad.
I brought a young lady who is eager to meet you properly.
Ms. Maria Goodrich, one of our most trusted agents.
- Hello, Frank.
- One of your most what?
Hmm, she told me you'd never believe her, but it's true.
I'll see you later.
Poor darling.
You might have told me before.
I tried, but you wouldn't believe me.
Yes, I know.
Maybe I still don't.
People who live in transparent bodies shouldn't be so suspicious.
Darling, will you ever be able to get rid of your plate-glass effect?
I can't spend the rest of my life greased up like this.
Besides, it itches.
Hmm. Right here.
Will you please get some tissue out of that drawer and wipe it off? Huh?
Yes.
Right here.
Hmm.
Frank, you're all there.
How did it happen?
Can't tell you.
It's a military secret.
You mean, you still don't trust me?
- Won't I ever find out?
- No.
I'll find out.
To the rear, march! To the rear, freeze!
Forward! To the right flank, freeze!
Forward! Platoon, halt.
At ease.
What was that number in Paris?
All heads up. Right face.
Forward march.
Extend. Hut!
Swing right. Hut!
"Merry Christmas." That's a crock.
Beats those replacement camps.
You said the war would be over by Christmas.
What do you want, egg in your beer?
Here we are, two hours from Paris.
The spitting image of Camp Wolters, Texas.
You know, they got a man in the army.
A two-star general.
But all he does is fly around in a private plane looking for ugly places.
Flat, sandy places. No trees, no water.
Then he checks up on the climate.
If it's too hot in summer for human life and too cold in winter... and if it has more rain, fog, wind, and snow... than any other spot he can find, then he plants the American flag... and proclaims it a US Army camp.
Did they drill that way at Camp Wolters?
Bombshell.
Box steps.
To the rear, freeze! Forward!
To the right flank, freeze!
Forward! Platoon, halt!
At ease!
Forty-two sixty what?
- Forty-two sixty-ten.
- Seventy!
Platoon, attention. Right face.
Forward march!
The Screaming Eagle.
They know who you are when you wear that on your sleeve.
It wasn't bad enough being in Infantry Replacement.
We have to volunteer for the 101st Airborne.
You go in gliders instead of trucks.
That's the only difference.
There must be a difference or they wouldn't give you extra pay.
Hooper, I don't think
I'll take in that movie tonight.
I'll be kind of busy getting acquainted and sewing on shoulder patches.
Why did they have to put us in different companies?
- Lf we ask them, they might do something.
- No. There's another major general.
His job is to find out who your buddy is and then to split you up.
- Don't forget, I'm in K Company.
- I won't.
And don't you forget, I'm in I Company.
Third platoon, second squad.
So long, Hooper.
Thanks.
Remember that lieutenant in Normandy... who said he'd court-martial the first man who tossed his gas mask away?
We ripped out the masks... and used the carriers for toting that cognac we liberated.
"Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday."
- Hiya. How did you make out?
- The lights were pretty bad... but I was really flipping them in there.
Six completed passes.
- I'll be hot in that game tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? You ain't going to Paris?
Him? He'd rather play football than eat.
With the chow we've been getting,
I don't blame him. But Paris...
It's gonna be lonesome here.
The whole platoon's going.
All except the replacements.
- Sgt. Wolowicz?
- Yeah?
My name is Layton.
I've been assigned to your squad.
Make yourself at home, but on some other sack.
- That one's mine.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Li'I Abner in Paris.
Boy, that's gonna be something.
Daisy Mae won't know you when you get back to Dogpatch.
That's for dang sure.
Abner, will you please stop saying that?
Fellows, look what I found.
- Holley.
- The Purple Heart kid.
At ease, men.
I heard the war was on its last legs, so I thought I'd come back.
Rough in the ETO.
A little scratch on his leg... and a month later he comes back in time for a three-day pass to Paris.
It was misery in that hospital, Kipp.
Passes every night, champagne, I'amour.
And me brooding all the time about my dear buddies back there... defending the Republic.
Will you look at that girl bait.
I'm getting me a mess of that fruit salad just as soon as we hit Paris.
You can have the sack next to me.
Nobody's got it, have they?
No, I was just sitting here.
- That's a nice-looking little girl.
- It's a boy.
What's it like, Holley?
- Paris?
- Yeah.
I spent my spare time in the art galleries.
But I happened to hear about a place that might interest you. Place Pigalle.
Pig Alley.
Be sure to bring your dog tags, because one night in Pig Alley...
Excuse me.
Because you're going to think you're the Caliph of Baghdad.
You guys talk about Piccadilly Circus.
Compared to Pig Alley, it's like the quiet room in a limey YMCA.
How about you and me boarding up in Paris?
What's the matter, did Pop Stazak disown you?
Pop can't go on account of his arthritis.
I love you, Roderigues. I love all of you.
But I'm getting me a private room and private bath in Paris... if I have to get it at the point of a gun.
The big brain wants to get away from us common people.
He hasn't got anybody around here to chat with about the Einstein Theory.
What do you mean? He's got me.
There ain't nothing we like to talk about better.
What happened to Lt. Belwick?
He was just your speed, Joe College.
He got hit in Holland.
It's all right, kid. Go right ahead.
Just brush me off when you're through.
- Holley, my boy, bonjour.
- Hiya. What are you busting out about?
It's nothing at all, son.
It's hardly worth mentioning.
They're just making me a civilian, that's all.
- They what?
- I wish I had arthritis.
It ain't the arthritis.
They got a report from the Red Cross... that my wife is too sick to take care of the kids.
So I let them talk me into accepting a dependency discharge.
Glad you made it, Pop.
Who's gonna adopt Roderigues?
He'd be lost without his Popsy Wopsy.
One of these days you're going to get a GI bootsie wootsie... right square in those GI teeth.
Such language. You should have learned him better manners, Pop.
- Knock it off, will you?
- When do you leave?
Any day now. I have to sweat out a letter of confirmation... from our higher headquarters.
You'll be in Paris.
No, I decided to catch that football game.
That's swell. It'll be rugged waiting around here all alone.
See you in the morning, Johnny.
You gonna miss me, Abner?
That's for dang sure.
I'm glad to see you guys finally got the junk off my cot.
How about dousing that light?
Paris trucks are leaving early.
Okay, douse it.
All right, roll out of them sacks.
Hit it.
Leave your cots and grab your socks.
Let's go, men. You're slow.
Get them up, Wolowicz.
- I ain't going to Paris.
- Nobody's going to Paris.
- We're moving up. On trucks.
- Moving up? Where to?
Beats me. The Krauts made a breakthrough someplace.
They tell me it's gonna be cold... so wear your long johns and two pairs of pants. Three, if you can get them on.
But they told us yesterday we'd be off the line for good.
They didn't get the order till after midnight.
There's trucks this time instead of gliders.
That's a good sign, anyway.
This is strictly for the birds, brother.
Beats anything ever I stuck my finger in before.
"General, I need a crack division to plug up that gap."
"A crack division, General?
I'd be honored if you'd use the 101st."
"Awfully nice of you, old boy.
Thanks a lot."
"Not at all, General."
Maybe the adjutant can put in a phone call.
Yeah. It's only a technicality.
- I forgot to tell you, men...
- Shut up!
It's a secret move, so rip off your shoulder patches.
Sarge, you got any of them rubber overshoes, them galoshes?
Can't fit you, Abner. Your feet's too small.
Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday.
Yeah, if you can find some cognac.
- No dice?
- I gotta wait for the letter. Regulations.
It's gonna be a cold trip.
Maybe you can ride in the driver's cab.
Wind it up.
Let's get this show on the road.
- That the new platoon leader?
- Yeah, fresh off the boat.
I understand your problems, men.
- I used to be an enlisted man myself.
- For six months, maybe.
And 17 weeks at OCS, and he's an officer and gentleman...
- by special act of Congress.
- Sound off!
Shut up!
- What did he say? Where are we?
- Are you kidding?
Do you speak French, sir?
Yes. Immediately.
- Cigarette?
- Thank you very much.
I don't smoke, but thanks anyway.
Thanks a lot.
What time is it, Hansan?
- What?
It can't be that late. We left at 2:00.
- Near lunchtime in Springfield.
- You never changed your watch?
What's the use of changing your watch?
What's the use? You're here, you're not in Springfield, Illinois.
I hear you.
This is what I like about the infantry.
You always know just what's going on.
How do you like this guy?
He don't like the infantry.
- Must be off his nut.
- He never had it so good.
He found a home in the Army.
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?
Chocolate, please.
Isn't she cute?
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?
Here.
Get a load of mama!
I'd like to keep her in chocolate for about a week.
What's she saying, Jarvess?
She wants to know if we'd like to come inside and warm up.
- Yes. Warm up, please.
- Oh, brother!
- I like these secret moves.
- We sure slipped one over on the Krauts.
How do they find out these things?
Who tells them?
- I keep them posted. Short wave.
- Somebody does.
They only occupied France for four years.
Naturally they left a few spies when they pulled out.
That's an idea.
Why don't us Gls hire some spies... so we'll know what's going on once in a while?
Get them inside! Come on!
On the double!
Kinnie, how about getting these men in out of the hot sun?
Wolowicz, Garby, in there with the second platoon.
This corner house.
I forgot to tell you.
Put those shoulder patches back on.
- Pop, I hear we're bedding down here.
- Overnight?
Yeah. Looks like a good house, too.
Smoke coming out of the chimney.
For once, we get a break.
Bastogne. I won't be forgetting this place in a hurry.
I wouldn't mind holing up here till Christmas.
I hear tell we might.
All the rumors is good ones.
This is the United States Armed Forces
Radio Service broadcasting from London.
Let's see if we can get some news.
- What's he selling?
- Wait till he slows down.
Ask her. I'll guarantee you she can sprechen sie Deutsch.
Let's live a little, Jarvess.
- Come on, mama, get yourself in gear.
- No, not mama.
These two little children, they live with me, but...
Slowly, please.
She said she's not the mother of the two little girls.
They're from a town near here.
Bombed out, both parents killed.
They all got a sob story.
- Let's cut a rug, Denise. Danser?
- No, we've cut enough.
You gotta keep paying these taxi dancers.
Fork over another chocolate bar.
What you say, please?
I said do you think the rain'll hurt the rhubarb?
What he say?
Is there any coffee left?
- Yes, plenty of coffee. Immediately.
- Thank you.
Anything you want.
Sure, as long as you pay for it.
They're all alike here.
Yes, they're all alike, Kipp.
Scared, hungry, lonely.
Come on, stop beating your gums.
Let a guy get some sleep.
Yeah, it's about that time.
We sure come a far piece today.
- You okay, Kipp?
- Okay.
Poor tired soldiers.
- You want?
- Thank you.
I go now?
I guess so. I'm all beat-up.
It never fails.
Every time you meet a pretty babe... you're either out on your feet or you get the order to move.
- What you say, please?
- Nothing.
- Thank you very much.
- All right.
Good night.
- Where are you going?
- Guard.
What did she say?
She said she's gonna hide the chocolate from the kids till Christmas.
I wish I knew for sure we'd be here tomorrow.
- You'll be here.
- Are you sure?
All we do is lie around till the fog lifts... so the air corps can come out and win the war for us.
In that case, I guess I'll take a chance.
This may go down in history as the greatest gamble of the war.
- Good night, Denise.
- Good night, soldier.
Wolowicz, are you absolutely sure?
Yeah, the C.O. Told us himself.
Wake me up early, will you?
Maybe.
I ought to report this to the Inspector General.
There's supposed to be 18 inches between bunks.
This is dangerous, spreads germs.
There's some hot coffee on the stove.
I can use it.
Don't worry about that plane.
It's one of ours, I think.
Halt. Password.
- Hamburgers.
- Onions.
I thought the 101st was the only division here.
They will be as soon as the rest of us can get out.
- What's up?
- We were a little over to the east.
Been there for weeks without firing a shot.
Then they started coming.
Tanks, planes. Everything you ever heard of and then some.
A Jerry plane turned on a loudspeaker in English.
It said Hitler will give Paris to the Germans for a Christmas present.
But they told us it was just a weak little counterattack.
They'll probably tell you that this is a strategic withdrawal.
- Good morning, soldier.
- Bonjour.
I'll be back in a minute.
Keep an eye on... What's going on?
Me and Gen. McAuliffe decided to move
I Company up on the line.
- That is, if you agree.
- I should have known better.
Maybe she'll give you a refund on those chocolate bars.
How much time have I got?
Ten minutes? Five minutes?
Anything you gotta do, you better do in 30 seconds.
Saddle up. Let's go, Holley.
Drop your packs and rolls.
Third platoon, on your feet.
We've got that patch of woods to clear.
Third platoon, any time there's a dirty detail.
Let's not be having any talk like that, soldier.
Let's go.
Keep sight of the man on each side of you.
Watch out for snipers.
Snipers, the man says.
Second squad, over here. Dig in.
You're in charge till I get back.
I'm going to see the Lieutenant.
- Don't go volunteer for any patrols.
- Who do I dig with, Sergeant?
That's right, we've got an odd man.
You can triple up with me and Hansan.
- Thanks. You want me to go with you?
- No, you stay and get the hole started.
Come on, Hansan, let's go.
Take ten, Jarvess.
Time for me to spare you.
Get out of here.
I'm sorry.
Let's not try to reach China this time.
There's no sense digging if you don't go deep.
Last time we dug one together... you went so deep that when I climbed out
I got the bends.
- How does it look?
- Great.
Only one thing wrong. We're moving.
- What?
- You heard me. It ain't my idea.
Saddle up, everybody, let's go.
Oh, no!
Just once I'd like to dig a foxhole... and find out that's the one I'm sleeping in.
Will you stop yapping?
First and third squads gotta run patrols all night.
- All we gotta do is...
- Standiferd, take over.
- I'm pulling the first shift on the roadblock.
- Okay.
You better take a blanket with you.
This fog... really gets to you.
I feel kind of woozy myself.
Let's go, Hansan.
Just get it started. We'll finish it up.
When you were in that camp in New York...
- did you ever phone your wife?
- Sure.
- What did it cost?
- A nickel. What did you think?
That's right. She came there to see you.
Did you phone your kids long distance?
Yeah, just before we shipped out.
- Why?
- What did that cost?
$2 for three minutes.
- Why, Johnny?
- I was thinking... it's probably about as far from New York to Wichita, where your kids were... as it is from Wichita to Los Angeles, where my folks are.
And when you get back home... what would that be, about 200 francs?
I'll send you a bill, Johnny.
Tell them that I...
Well, you'll think of something.
And if it runs over three minutes, it's okay.
Put out that fire. It's getting dark, Holley.
Put on that steel pot and get over to the roadblock.
Three on a shift at night:
You, Kipp, and the new man.
They said to look out for Krauts wearing GI uniforms.
What about the password?
That might be nice to know, in case somebody thinks we're Krauts.
- Bug-jitter.
- Thanks.
Here, don't get any dirt in these eggs.
Okay, you get half of them.
- How do you feel, Standiferd?
- Terrible.
It's settling down in my chest.
I'm almost sure I have a fever.
I had a fever in Holland, but the medics wouldn't let me off the line.
You have to have 102. That's a regulation.
Listen to that voice. I can hardly talk.
Yeah, it sounds good.
Halt! Password!
- Bug.
- Jitter.
- What is this, Charlie Company?
- No, sir, ltem.
I Company?
This must be the road to Neufchateau.
- I think it is.
- You want to be sure of things, soldier.
- Is there a bridge up ahead?
- Yes, about half a mile out.
Good. Let's go.
Smart cookie. Wearing his bars on patrol.
Must be a new replacement.
Don't let that happen again.
Speak English.
Yes, sir.
Oh, no!
Look, Pop, it's snowing!
I never saw snow up close before.
It's beautiful.
You didn't, by any chance hear... that it's kind of cold and a little on the wet side, did you?
Man, it's really coming down.
Well, close the window, Johnny, and fix that hole in the roof.
You should know better than to take off your boots in a foxhole.
You might want to start running fast.
- I can't sleep with wet boots on.
- Then wear your galoshes until they dry.
I ain't got no galoshes.
- Where did you get those branches?
- Where do you generally get branches?
- I didn't know if the woods were cleared.
- Yeah, sure. K Company's in there.
- K Company?
- Yeah.
I got a buddy in K Company.
- Is this K Company?
- Yeah.
- Where will I find Hooper?
- Hooper? Never heard of him.
Bill Hooper. I know he's in K Company.
He's not in my platoon.
That first hole is the company C.P.
- They'll know where he is.
- Thanks.
What platoon is Hooper in,
William J. Hooper?
Nobody by that name in K Company.
Yes, there is. He came in with the new replacements just the other day.
That was his name? Hey, Sergeant.
What's up?
That kid they got at last night, name is Hooper. William J. Hooper.
Now I can finish making out my morning report. Thanks.
Direct hit on his foxhole. A mortar.
You don't hear them coming.
You don't know what hit you.
You didn't even know his name.
We didn't even find his dog tags.
Chatsburg News.
Li'I Abner gets one: The Dogpatch Gazette.
I'll take it.
- Sorry, Pop.
- It'll probably come up in the next batch.
You act as if I want a discharge.
Man, I like it here.
Stick around, Kinnie. We're going to choose up sides for a snowball fight.
Hand these letters out with the rations, Hansan.
They're all dinner, for once without coffee.
Dinner rations, with that vitamin-packed lemonade powder:
"Simply add water and serve ice-cold. Delicious."
- About that patrol, Kinnie...
- I can't let you go on it, Wolowicz.
I want to be sure you'll be around to take over the platoon if I have to go back.
My feet froze up pretty bad last night.
I want three volunteers to go out on a patrol.
You, you, and you.
You're in charge, Holley.
Why am I always volunteering for patrol?
- I'm just a cowboy.
- All right, this is the deal, Holley.
G-2 says the Krauts dropped some paratroops last night.
And they might be hiding in that patch of woods on the other side of that farm.
G-2. Wonderful how they always know what's cooking.
Well, I can tell you something they do know.
Last night, some Krauts in GI uniforms infiltrated right through this area.
They blew up a bridge on the road to Neufchateau.
Was one of them wearing lieutenant bars?
- How did you know?
- We get all the latest rumors.
Rumor, my eye.
They captured one of them.
Spoke English perfect. Knew our password, plan of deployment, everything.
Kinnie, how about showing me the way to the aid station?
I'm freezing.
- Feeling any better?
- Worse. Much worse.
Never felt so sick in my life.
Maybe I've even got pneumonia.
He's really bad.
Yeah, he's a cinch to go back to the field hospital. Maybe even to Paris.
I don't know. That penicillin...
He's liable to be back in a day.
Yeah, a good, clean flesh wound is better.
Then they got to send you back.
No, thanks. I don't smoke.
Guys get sick, guys get wounded, and nothing ever happens to me.
Nothing except that time you broke your faux choppers.
It was when you were back. Kipp found out you can't keep a man on the line... unless he's got at least six teeth of his own.
I didn't know about that.
So he broke his GI teeth with the butt of his rifle.
I ran into a tree trunk in the dark.
He was off the line for two weeks getting a new set made.
Let's get this patrol on the road.
That's incoming mail.
Holley, I think your eggs are about done.
We've had good deals before, but this is the best one yet.
This is great. I don't ever wanna go back.
I found a home in the Army.
Of course, you can see snow from LA.
Way off in the mountains.
They got us zeroed in.
I'm getting out of here.
I hope he makes it. They should never have sent him back on the line.
Some guys just can't take it.
Wolowicz, there's something
I want you to know.
My name is Layton.
- I know it is.
- I just wanted to be sure.
Thanks.
This is what G-2 calls a patch of woods.
A whole division could be hiding in that forest.
Nice job for a three-man patrol.
Yeah, if we don't get back, that's how they'll know we ran into some Krauts.
- What's the password?
- Texas.
Keep them covered. They may be German.
- Any line on these woods, Major?
- I didn't hear the countersign.
Leaguer. Texas Leaguer.
Will this road take us to Third Bat headquarters?
- Straight ahead.
- Get going.
- Just a minute. What is a Texas leaguer?
- How's that?
- I said what's a Texas leaguer?
- It's some kind of baseball term.
- What kind?
- A safe hit just over the infielder's head...
Nobody asked you.
How'd the Dodgers make out?
- Who's your commanding officer?
- He knows how the Dodgers made out.
- Let's see your dog tags.
- What?
We're not taking any chances.
What is this?
What kind of nonsense...
Drop those rifles.
- Who's Betty Grable going with?
- Cesar Romero.
- Quiet. Who's the Dragon Lady?
- She's in Terry and the Pirates.
- What's a hotrod?
- A hopped-up jalopy.
- Joe, what do you know?
- Just got back from a vaudeville show.
- I guess they're okay.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
PFC, Major. Praying For Civilian.
That's why I believe in being careful.
May I suggest, sir, that you study up on baseball?
I guess I'd better.
By the way, you might tell your buddy that Cesar Romero is out.
She's married to Harry James.
Let's go.
They really should have sent out a bigger patrol.
- Lf you want to goof off...
- Who said anything about goofing off?
Nobody.
I'm just saying the best way is to tell them... you heard voices talking in German.
Let's say we heard voices talking in Japanese and let G-2 figure that out.
That paper any good?
Best in the world. Sedalia News.
Keep your gloves off for two minutes and you'd have Popsicles instead of fingers.
Get a load of this.
"Our Changing Times, by Mrs. Donald Jarvess...
"pinch-hitting for your favorite columnist and her favorite husband...
"now on active duty, US Army."
You knew I worked on a newspaper.
Yeah, but a column?
You must be pretty good.
I was too good. I wrote a piece about the real meaning of the war... the fight against Fascism, why every
American had to get in there and pitch in.
The logic was magnificent.
You couldn't resist it.
The next thing I knew,
I was in a troop train... waving bye-bye to my wife.
- Came the dawn?
- Yeah.
Only one thing gets me.
When you work on a newspaper...
I'd get those wire releases... and know that I was the first person in town who had the news. All the news.
I'll guarantee you, my wife knows what's going on in Bastogne.
All I know is what's happening to the second squad... in the third platoon of I Company.
Watch this one.
Strike!
Can't hit them if you can't see them.
Now the count's three and two.
Man on first and third.
Two out. This is the one that counts.
Foul ball. Come on, let's have a fast one.
Burn it in, boy. Come on.
A hit right over second base.
There, the center fielder made a shoestring catch. You're out.
- How about it, ump?
- Sound off, pal. Password?
Don't you get it? Right over second base.
- Texas.
- Leaguer.
- You in charge?
- No, the lieutenant.
Hiya, fellows.
What's the situation, Lieutenant?
Nothing but pine trees in these woods.
We've been through them.
- I guess our mission's accomplished.
- Courtesy of K Company.
You can tell them to stop worrying about this area.
Them and us both, Lieutenant. Thanks.
- I guess we might as well partie.
- So long.
- So long.
- So long, fellows.
Come on, on the double. They're Krauts.
Come on!
Kraut tanks!
No. Take off, will you?
If they think we're all getting away, maybe I've got a chance.
- Go on.
- We'll send a patrol back.
- Don't forget the sulfa powder.
- Go on, get in there.
Let's go.
- You're sure they were enemy tanks?
- We saw them, Lieutenant.
Think we've got enough antitank grenades to do any good?
We ain't got any.
Mind if I make a suggestion, Lieutenant?
What?
Sir, our usual defense against tanks is to call for artillery... and then run like a jackrabbit.
We've got orders to hold these positions.
All right, sir, but let's call for artillery and keep our heads down.
We could send out some bazooka men, if we had any bazookas.
- Put in a call for artillery.
- Yes, sir.
What a break.
Artillery's got that farmhouse zeroed in.
Concentration 17.
Item three to ltem:
Kraut tanks by burning farmhouse.
Concentration 17.
Roger. Start the fireworks.
That's great. Artillery can't miss.
They've got Roderigues to use for an aiming stick.
Tell Wolowicz to send out for Roderigues as soon as this barrage lifts.
With what, a sponge?
I've got to get me a rifle.
Any extra ones, Garby?
No, we haven't had any casualties yet.
There's a rifle waiting for you, Holley.
Your squad sent for the meat wagon after the last shelling.
- Who was hit, Doc?
- Wolowicz.
Is he bad?
A shell landed right on the edge of his foxhole.
His shoulder's like a sieve.
- Where's your steel pot, soldier?
- I lost it, Sergeant.
You can try mine on for size... Sergeant.
You're in charge now.
Leadership. That's what I got.
Where's Roderigues?
He'll be along, Pop.
Should have worn my shoulder pads.
In a couple of months you'll be flipping those forward passes as good as ever.
Yeah, left-handed.
He's a good man, Holley... but still a little jumpy.
He can move in with me.
You could do worse.
He sleeps warm and quiet.
His name's Layton. Jim Layton.
- So long, Wolowicz.
- Take it easy.
Say hello to Standiferd.
- Hansan, you can move in with Pop.
- What about Roderigues?
Is that incoming mail?
No, it's outgoing.
There'll be plenty more of it.
- What time is it, Hansan?
- 10:30. No, it must be 11:30 here.
Where's Roderigues?
Let's take a walk, Pop.
How much longer are they going to leave him out there?
Let's partie.
We can carry him back in this blanket.
I want three volunteers.
It's a long walk, Pop.
- I need a fourth for bridge.
- I'll be the dummy.
You don't have to, Layton.
Maybe you'll find some more eggs.
What are you looking for, Kipp, your discharge?
- I lost my teeth.
- You lost them?
They were searching me on a roadblock, so I put them in my pocket.
- And they jumped out?
- Dropped out.
I hope it's nice and warm back where you're going.
I can't chew on K rations with my gums.
No! Keep your eye open.
He used to see snow way off in the mountains.
They say it's just like going to sleep.
He was a religious kid.
When anyone got hit... he used to say it was God's will.
- What's the Bulge?
- Search me.
"Hitler's mighty counteroffensive swept on yesterday under a news eclipse...
"from which filtered the fact that German armor had plunged 20 miles into Belgium."
We're in Belgium, aren't we?
Thought it was Luxembourg.
Let's see that.
"War Department authorities report that morale is high all along the front.
"Battle-hardened doughboys fresh from epic-making triumphs..."
Skip the commercial, Jarvess.
"Air activity was halted by thick, swirling fog.
"At Bastogne, the 101st Airborne..."
Hey, that's us.
Then you'll be proud to know that you are making a heroic stand...
"hurling back the best that Von Rundstedt can throw at you."
- Who's Von Rundstedt?
- A Kraut general. The best they've got.
Is the 101st the only division up here?
It doesn't say.
We'll have to wait for the next edition.
- Where's Pop Stazak?
- Him and Hansan are on a roadblock.
Well, this might be it. It looks official.
Chatsburg News.
And The Dogpatch Gazette.
Get back to the aid station, Kinnie, before those feet of yours get any worse.
They won't take frozen feet unless they start to change color.
No combat fatigue, no fever cases.
You have to be bleeding from a wound.
All they got at the aid station is aspirin and iodine.
- What about the field hospital?
- Captured.
Medics, casualties, equipment, the works.
It must have been after the meat wagon got there with Wolowicz.
I guess Standiferd was there, too.
Some of the walking wounded were killed.
They say the fight they put up was one for the book.
Layton, you're learning too fast.
How about spelling me for a bit?
The dreams are getting better all the time.
I was back home in Baltimore...
Ioading up on hard-shell crabs and beer.
That dream's against regulation, soldier.
You know what our boys overseas always dream about.
- Mom's blueberry pie.
- Why, certainly!
That's what we're fighting for.
Boy, when I get home... just give me a hot dog and a slice of that pie.
Am I gonna kick if I don't get my job back?
No sirree. All I want is a...
So long, Holley.
So long, Pop.
- Au revoir.
- I found them!
I found them in another pocket!
You're just in time to work Pop's shift.
Go up and get Hansan.
- Where you going?
- Special Orders, Number 1437:
"Private Ernest J. Stazak will proceed to Paris...
"where transportation to the US will be arranged."
- Relax, chum. You ain't going no place.
- I ain't?
Here, read it yourself.
I don't care what it says.
Nobody's leaving Bastogne, and nobody's coming in... except maybe some Krauts riding tanks.
We're surrounded.
Surrounded?
If this is one of your crummy jokes...
I'll knock those GI teeth right down your throat.
Take it easy, Pop.
He wouldn't have those teeth back in his mouth if there was any way out.
Tough break, Pop.
You know,
I can get them in a lot of trouble for this.
It's against the rules of war to shoot at civilians.
I'm sorry, Kipp.
Them poor devils in the footslogging infantry... nothing but walk, walk, walk.
The airborne, that's the life.
It's great up here in these gliders, drifting along over the clouds.
They're liable to have you up in juvenile court for smoking.
This your first time away from home, Layton?
Basic training was.
That wasn't quite the same.
My folks stayed for a while at a town near camp.
Did Mama rub your little footsies after those nasty 20-mile hikes?
She made me brush my teeth twice a day... so I wouldn't have to have them all pulled out.
- Hey, look at that.
- What?
I thought it was a shadow.
It's just some burnt-out powder.
You'll die of old age before you see a shadow around here.
This fog ain't never gonna lift.
Did the planes have to wait?
Haven't they ever heard of flying blind?
Nobody cares. They just don't care.
I don't believe that, Kipp.
Reverend Layton will now lead us in prayer.
Might not be a bad idea.
The C.O. Says you're to dig in at that railroad embankment.
The rest of the company's moving back 500 yards.
Right.
Third platoon, whenever there's a dirty detail.
Let's go, men. On your feet.
Check your rifles. See if they're froze up.
Listen to Holley, making a noise like a sergeant.
He's really GI now since he took over the squad. Right on the ball.
Yeah. Strictly chicken, that's me.
Let's be chicken those bolts.
Check your rifles.
Why can't they pass down some information?
If a man gets hit, he must at least know what country he's dying in.
Now, that's for sure. That's for dang sure.
I've asked you 800 times...
I won't say that no more, Jarvess.
That's for sure.
Can't see them.
I'm with you, Holley.
Come on.
Second squad! You, too, Mac! Follow me!
Let's go, Abner!
Mama.
Wait till it clears.
Hold your fire.
Tell them to come out with their hands up.
Layton, you and Joe check them for maps and papers.
See if any of them are still kicking.
Get the prisoners and wounded back to Bastogne, Sergeant.
See if we've got enough men left, Holley.
I'm going to put this man in for a Silver Star.
You know, a guy ought to be able to get
$100 for this back in Paris.
I thought Holley was running away.
That's why I ran after him.
How do you know what Holley was thinking?
How do you know if he was thinking at all?
Things just happen.
Afterwards you try to figure out why you acted the way you did.
I know why I ran. I was scared to death.
You just joined the biggest club in the Army. Everybody belongs.
Just drop me off at the psycho ward.
Why did I have to get up and start firing?
A good thing somebody did.
Yeah. It didn't have to be me. A volunteer.
It happened so fast, you had no time to look at your watch.
Yeah, sure forgot what time it was in Springfield.
- Hansan, I hate to ask you, but...
- You can have it.
Let's get out of here, chum.
Thanks, Pop.
I'll drop back later.
Just don't get carried back.
Say, miss, how about giving him a shot?
Morphine. Him.
No more morphine?
That's great.
She pours him one more,
I'm gonna get myself shot.
They're way too big.
I wished we'd found them yesterday.
Let's go, men. Chow!
- What?
- You heard me. Hot chow!
I've been pulling KP ever since.
We was bombed out twice.
I'm telling you,
I never saw so much incoming mail.
Yeah, things are getting rough all over.
I wanted to go back on the line.
But they're short-handed in the kitchen, see.
A couple more KPs got hit this morning.
I wouldn't mind a little action for a change.
How about you and me switching?
Oh, no. They'd never let me go.
I've been learning how to cook.
- Bettis, anything left?
- No.
But it's clean. It's only leftovers.
I don't even see those things.
I wanna see them.
I wanna remember them.
We'll start back in about an hour.
Better stick around this area.
Where's the kid?
Who, Layton? He's in the barn, I guess, putting on those dry clothes.
Bettis, how about breaking loose with a bottle of cognac?
We ain't got any.
I'll settle for some hot water to wash my feet in.
Coming right up.
Bettis, you got any trading material?
The belly robber keeps everything locked.
But there's half a loaf of bread.
A half a loaf is...
Where is it?
I could have sworn it was on that table.
Hello, soldier.
Pull up a chair, Holley.
Today you are a man.
This is Antwerp, up here.
To the north and the east are the British and the Canadians.
Down at Belfort, over 300 miles away, is the French First Army.
The Americans are stretched out all the way in between.
If the supply line to Antwerp is cut... at least 20 Allied divisions will be strictly out on a limb.
- Where's Bastogne?
- There.
This is where the Krauts found a soft spot in our line.
You see why Bastogne is so important.
It's at the main intersection of seven main highways... one of them leading straight to Antwerp.
Don't know if we can hold out.
That sounds like ours.
It is ours!
Can't see a thing.
The supplies they've got to drop, we wouldn't want.
A crate of eggs for Berlin.
If bombers can get through, why can't C-47s?
In this pea soup?
- They're flying way over, you know that.
- The air corps.
London this morning,
Berlin this afternoon. Headlines tomorrow.
Fellows, come on back.
It's getting lonesome here!
Nobody cares. They just don't care.
You can say that again.
I thought they had us surrounded.
Halt.
I speak English. Who is here in command?
I am here in command.
We have a message for the commanding general.
I'll get a jeep and take the officers back.
Blindfold them.
Try it again, Jarvess.
All I can get out of them is their name and rank.
Loosen up, chum. Give us the lowdown.
You can talk now. Hitler kaput.
How would you like some nice K rations?
Now we're getting somewhere.
He says he'll talk for a pack of cigarettes.
What did he say?
They want us to surrender.
"Surrender or be killed," he says.
Us?
Tell him to go take a flying leap at a rolling doughnut.
The Major thinks General McAuliffe must have misunderstood.
We've appealed to the well-known American humanity... to save the people of Bastogne from further suffering.
We have given you two hours to consider before raining destruction upon you.
We do not understand
General McAuliffe's answer.
I'll be glad to repeat it.
The answer is, "Nuts!"
Is that a negative or an affirmative reply?
"Nuts" is strictly negative.
We will kill many Americans.
On your way, bud.
I feel better. For once we know what's going on around here.
For once we get the story... before my wife writes it up and it's the daily news.
Here goes my last butt.
Don't tell me your problems.
Tell the chaplain.
Chaplain. I forgot.
We've got nothing to worry about.
Holy Joe is going to pray for us at the Christmas services.
"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.
"They shall mount up with wings as eagles."
If the fog lifts.
"They shall run, and not be weary."
Unless they have frozen feet.
"And they shall walk, and not faint."
If they don't lose too much blood before the medics come up.
Another airmail message from the Krauts.
"Merry Christmas, soldier, and our deepest sympathy.
"It's tough being away from home at this time of year...
"especially when you're surrounded and outnumbered 10-to-1.
"Don't you feel your loved ones worrying about you, praying for you?
"Yes, old boy, praying and hoping you'll come home again.
"Man, have you thought about it?
What if you don't come back?
"Just remember this:
Where there's a will, there's a way.
"Hot chow and safety are waiting for you only 300 yards away."
Anybody here from Ohio?
- Buckeye Lake, sir.
- Cincinnati.
- Maple Heights, sir.
- Tippecanoe City, sir.
I'm from Chillicothe.
Any of you men Lutherans?
Here, sir.
- I am, sir.
- My wife is, sir.
So am I.
These services aren't just for Lutherans, any more than just for men from Ohio.
I merely happen to be in your area.
In other areas, there are other chaplains of various denominations and religions.
All of us Holy Joes are switch-hitters.
Earlier this month in Holland,
I held Hanukkah services... for some of the men of the Jewish faith.
How did I do, Levenstein?
Not bad for a beginner, sir.
Now it's nearly Christmas... and here we are in beautiful Bastogne enjoying the winter sports.
And the $64 question is:
"Was this trip necessary?"
I'll try to answer that.
But my sermons, like everything else in the army... depend on the situation and the terrain.
So I assure you this is going to be a quickie.
Was this trip necessary?
Let's look at the facts.
Nobody wanted this war but the Nazis.
A great many people tried to deal with them, and a lot of them are dead.
Millions have died... for no other reason except that the Nazis wanted them dead.
So, in the final showdown, there was nothing left to do except fight.
There's a great lesson in this.
Those of us who've learned it the hard way aren't going to forget it.
We must never again let any force dedicated to a super-race... or a super-idea, or super-anything... become strong enough to impose itself upon a free world.
We must be smart enough and tough enough in the beginning... to put out the fire before it starts spreading.
So my answer to the $64 question is:
Yes, this trip was necessary.
As the years go by, a lot of people are going to forget.
But you won't.
And don't ever let anybody tell you... you were a sucker to fight in the war against Fascism.
And now, Jerry permitting, let us pray.
Let us pray for this fog to lift.
Almighty God...
The organist is hitting those bass notes a little too loud for me to be heard.
So let us each pray in his own way, to his own God.
When you hear planes, men, don't bother to look up.
They'll be ours.
Yeah, they'll all be going to Berlin.
Layton, you haven't got a beat-up, old chocolate bar, have you?
I'm on that new lemonade diet.
Drop another nickel in the jukebox, will you, chum?
We interrupt this program with an important announcement.
A careful study of the most scientific instruments and maps... lead to the following weather forecast.
Continued cold, more snow, and no sign of the fog lifting.
And now an old favorite, which is growing more and more popular... with the men of the 101st:
I Surrender, Dear.
Krauts walking around down there.
Tanks, too.
What am I supposed to use for ammunition? Spitballs?
We've got 10 rounds left for Old Betsy.
- What about the tank at the roadblock?
- Can't move up. They're out of gas.
Try and get some news on that radio.
Krauts have got it jammed up, everything except their own wavelength.
I'll try again.
They ain't even dug in.
- Holley.
- What?
Is there anything to those stories about Krauts shooting prisoners?
- Where'd you get that?
- It's going around.
I heard that if you've got a Kraut pistol on you when you're captured... they blow your brains out with it.
Don't fall for them rumors, Layton.
Anybody want a Luger?
It's worth $100 in Paris.
Thanks a lot.
It's a violation of the Sullivan Act for a civilian to carry firearms.
If I was you, Lieutenant,
I'd hightail it out of here.
Other side of the hill! Dig in!
A careful study of the most scientific instruments and maps... leads me to believe that German bombers are over Bastogne... fog or no fog.
Kind of rough on rear echelon tonight.
Yeah, I've been thinking... the Mess Sergeant, the Supply Sergeant... the pill roller who gives us those shots with a square needle...
I'm bleeding for them.
...let me avoid death... let me have forgiveness... the eternal farewell.
Fall out in and draw a rifle!
- A rifle?
- They just made you a rifleman. Me, too.
The medics told me I wasn't supposed to go up anymore. You can check.
Get your blanket.
Fall out. Draw rifles and ammo right now!
- Chow?
- You ain't even warm.
Follow me, all of you, on the double!
That's all, brother.
Hey, you! Front and center!
Good thing they didn't send me up.
I never even fired an M-1 rifle.
Last time I was out on the range, they were still using the.03.
All litter cases will prepare to be evacuated immediately... to air raid shelters.
All walking wounded will fall out and draw rifles.
This is a.30-caliber, gas-operated, clip-fed, semiautomatic rifle.
Look, you ain't selling it to me.
You're only showing me how it works.
To load it, you just pull the bolt back like this, and stick the clip in.
- What's up, Smitty?
- Battalion says to pull back.
- Go ahead.
- You, too, sir. They said to tell you.
It's a cinch we ain't pulling back that way.
I guess maybe we ain't pulling back at all.
Lieutenant, take the second squad.
First squad! Third squad! Over here.
Save it, Layton.
They'll be getting a lot closer, and we'll still be here.
It's shining!
How have you been?
Jarvess, look at them! They got here!
Drive them out of there! Blast them!
C-47s!
What was that about eagles?
"They shall mount up with wings as eagles.
"They shall run and not be weary."
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Let's go!
- Save me a couple of drops for my lighter.
- Lighter?
I got a little old lamp I got to fill back in Bastogne.
K rations.
All dinners.
Hey, fellows, here it is.
Hey, fellows, come and get it.
Here, take your watch.
Daddy, what are them things?
It's a new kind of warfare, son.
Mechanized, I think they call it.
Read about it in the Stars and Stripes.
What will they think of next?
Tank job, cigarette for papa?
Got a Stars and Stripes?
It's two days old.
Heard it's been pretty rugged up here.
That's for sure. That's for dang sure.
Hey, handsome.
Good luck!
The folks back home knew we'd get out of this.
They heard relief was breaking through two days ago.
Fine. I'd hate to think they'd been worrying.
You'll be happy to know we're in Belgium, not Luxembourg.
Just so we're going back.
That's all that counts.
You mean you're not happy in the service?
I didn't say that. I love it.
You found a home in the Army, chum.
Me, too. Never had it so good in my life.
Third platoon, on your feet.
Fall in.
Oh, no!
About face.
Forward march.
Whatever happened to Jody?
All right. Come on.
What do you want these guys to think, you're a bunch of WACs?
All right. Pick it up. Hut, two, three.
Afternoon, Mr Smith.
Afternoon, Mr Munroe.
- Hello, Bert.
- Hello, Gus.
- Lovely afternoon. Hmph!
- Not 'alf, it ain't.
- Hello, Mr Miggs.
- Hello, young fellow, me lad.
What you got there?
- Package for Major General Denistoun.
- Retired.
Oh. Been chasin' 'im 'alf over the bloomin' country, that 'as.
Oh, it has? I'll see that he gets it.
- Thanks, chum.
- Righto.
Here you are, Horace.
Give that to Major General Denistoun.
And this here, kindly hand it to
Mr Quentin Reynolds. Do you know him?
Yes.
He's the American.
All right, hop along now.
And blow your
blinkin'nose, will you?
- Food is pretty scarce, though.
- Mr Quentin Reynolds?
- Yes.
- Telegram, sir.
- Thank you, son. Excuse me, boys.
- Thank you.
Yes, certainly.
- Beg pardon, sir.
- Yes?
- Package, sir.
- Oh, thank you, Horace.
Well, I'll be damned.
His ears are pierced.
That's what we've been telling you, old boy.
Yes, but a man like Denistoun.
Old school tie. Sandhurst.
A general with his ears pierced like a gypsy.
Why, it's fantastic.
What's the idea?
No one has ever had the cheek to ask him.
He was in Europe when the war broke out.
Came home and there they were.
Must have been black magic.
He came home a changed man.
Used to be a most frightful stuffed shirt.
Quite a nice old chap now.
I say, what's the rush?
Oh, this. I have to grab a 5.30 plane for Paris.
But look, if either of you boys get the lowdown on Denistoun's ears...
- drop me a line, will ya?
- Be glad to, if and when.
- Fine.
- Well, so long, Reynolds.
- And thanks for everything.
- So long, man.
I'll be seeing you.
- Nice fellow... for an American.
- Hmm.
Right. Right you are.
Righto.
Bit of a mob on that Paris plane, sir, but I finally wangled it.
5.30, Northolt. The fog's lifted.
Oh, you're wonderful, Miggs.
You're beautiful!
I love you, Miggs!
Come, let me give you a kiss.
You'd better hurry, sir.
That is, if you're going to pack.
Thank you, Miggs.
- Why don't you ask me and have it over?
- What?
- At least you'll admit you're curious.
- Curious?
- Why, curious about what?
- My ears.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean-
Oh, come, come.
Own up.
Well, all right.
But it is odd, you know.
What I mean is, they look like they've been pierced for earrings.
Do they really?
By Jove, they probably do.
Well, well.
- I was wondering if you'd mind talking about it.
- Not at all. Not at all.
Then why has it been top secret for so long?
For the very simple reason that nobody's ever asked me.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Let's go back a bit.
How did you know that I was thinking about your ears?
- How did you know?
- Well, that's part of my story.
There's a woman in it, of course.
A woman of such extraordinary accomplishments that I- well, it all started shortly before war broke out.
I was in Germany. A prisoner.
Before the war? A prisoner?
Yes, I was a lieutenant colonel then.
And together with a youngster named Byrd was on a special mission.
Very hush-hush, you know.
Not at all in my line, exactly... except that I spoke
German like a native.
We were trying to nail a poison gas formula.
Something new. An appalling by-product of Nazi frightfulness.
Anyway, I don't think
I was very good... because the blighters knocked us off like a couple of sitting pheasants.
And we were being held for questioning, Byrd and I... in a farmhouse not very far from Weimar.
 One way and another,
we were in a pretty tight spot.
Our guards, an S.S. First lieutenant
and a couple of troopers...
were as pretty a crew
of cutthroats as ever you saw.
There was also an official
of the Geheime Staatspolizei.
A dreadful fellow named Hoff.
Oh, he was a horror!
He'd questioned us
more than once and we knew.
Young Byrd called him
"Jack the Ripper."
J felt particularly sorry for young Byrd.
Nicest chap imaginable.
His affection for me was positively
touching. A sort of hero worship.
Used to embarrass
the devil out of me.
Though why he liked me
J'll never know.
Looking back, J must have been
a pretty offensive sort of fellow.
You know, pre-war army.
Spit-and-polish.
"Stand to attention when you address
an officer. "All that sort of thing.
Anyhow, we'd planned to escape,
and this was the night.
This was it.
Wasn't much of a plan.
Odds against it coming off...
were about
a thousand to one.
We'd chosen this particular
night to escape...
because Hitler was going
to broadcast from Munich...
and a pretty safe bet his laddie boys
downstairs would listen in.
J didn't know about Byrd,
but personally J was scared stiff.
I don't know about you, but personally I'm in an absolute sweat.
Positively trickling, sir.
Well, here we go.
- Let's hope only one comes up.
- More than one, we're sunk.
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
- Sieg heil!
- Why doesn't somebody throw him a fish?
Sieg heil!
- Wir mussten-
- Heil Hitler!
... in der minoritaet belieben
wir die wertvollsten...
- elemente des kampfes
und des opfersinns...
- 
- In der nation mobilisierten die,
die zu allen zeiten nicht...
- 
- Ah! That dog! Why doesn't somebody-
- shh!
Die minderheit ausgemacht haben.
Ja. Ja.
Zweig!
Weil dieser beste rassenwert-
They're coming, sir.
... mutig und kuehn die fuehrung des reiches-
Pfeiffer, see what's the matter with that dog! Pfeiffer!
...groesserer zahl dieser fuehrung... angeschlossen und unterstellt.
I say, look!
There's something frightfully wrong!
- J saw him put something
in his mouth. Then he-
-  What was it?
- He said it was an aspirin.
- Aspirin! Where would he get aspirin?
And then he had a sort of fit.
His heart's hardly beating!
You're a stupid English swine!
If he's taken poison, if he's dead, I'll-
Wer sich als traeger seines besten blutes fuehit... und dieses wissen zur fuehrung der nation erhoben hat... und entschlossen ist diese fuehrung zu behalten.
Wahrzunehmen und nicht-
Where is Obersturmfuehrer Zweig?
He's upstairs.
He told me to go see about that dog.
You imbecile!
Get back up there!
All right, you blighters!
Take off the uniform.
Tie him up.
I say, old boy.
You can't do that, you know.
Von ihnen wird mehr gefordert als von-
- Get on with it, man!
- Sorry.
- Hurry up!
...den millionen der
uebrigen volksgenossen.
 We stole Hoff's car,
a big, black brute of a Mercedes...
and heading for Stuttgart,
drove all night.
One thought cheered us.
They couldn't broadcast a general
alarm for two Englishmen...
without tipping off
the British embassy.
Jt would have to be
a private manhunt.
However, sooner or later,
we knew we'd have to scupper the car.
So shortly after dawn-
- Well, here's where we separate.
- Right, sir.
Now listen carefully. First thing you must do is get rid of that uniform.
Get some other clothes. You'll probably have to steal them, understand?
- Perfectly.
- Then make your way to Esbach, near Freiburg.
Esbach, remember.
And J'll join you there.
Now here's the thing.
Whoever gets to Esbach first... marks the road signpost to Freiburg with three dots... and then waits for the other.
Is that clear?
Quite. Three dots on the signpost to Freiburg.
Yes. Then we'll carry on from where we left off.
- Contact Professor Krosigk.
- Yes. How about money?
Loads. Hoff was absolutely stinking with it.
That's good.
Well, good luck to you.
I say, sir.
Thanks awfully, sir.
- I mean for everything.
You've been absolutely marvellous.
- Goodbye.
Yes, and thanks to Hoff's blunderings, we've lost a good five hours.
Of course the man is an idiot. Goodbye.
You are, you know, with all your brains in your belly.
Hmm. The car was last seen near Marbach.
If no further reports come in,
I'm going to assume that the car has been disposed of.
Possibly in a river.
The Neckar, for instance. Come here.
Heavily wooded country.
I think we shall begin from here.
Yes.
Jn there it is very damp.
J have good fire here.
And stew.
- You are hungry.
- Yes.
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I am, very.
I wonder, would you sell me some of that, whatever it is?
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I make good fish stew.
- Look.
- Yes, it looks excellent.
Onions and potatoes.
And garlic and barley and mushrooms.
Plenty of fine, fat fish.
The fish I catch in the river.
The vegetables, tonight was farmer with a sick cow.
I made it well. Oh, it was easy.
This morning I put black curse on it.
That is Apple.
- Apple?
- My horse.
Stop watching.
There's nobody.
You're safe here.
Quite safe.
You look like a military man.
Eat! It is good.
Thank you.
- There's something on your chin.
- Huh?
There's something on your chin.
Ah. This is to keep evil eye away. Good.
Gypsy superstition.
By the way, I thought gypsies always travelled around in caravans.
You want to know why
I travel alone, huh?
It was that evil, misbegotten son of a goat, that Zoltan.
May he rot and swell and split himself inside out.
With coals of fire in his belly may he die slowly.
Better you put that coat on, liebling.
Coat?
Thank you, I'm not cold.
I know it is a military coat.
And there's also a good pair of trousers too. Huh?
And you were going to throw into the river that bundle.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. You must never throw away things that are worth good money.
German uniform.
You're not German.
You're... English... huh?
Madame, you're drawing some very dangerous conclusions.
That man you kill, you look in his mouth?
You should. Sometimes these Germans have gold in their teeth.
You are the colonel, huh?
They catch the other one, your friend?
Oh, liebling, liebling, you must not kill me. Not with that.
The patrols would hear.
They would come.
Oh, don't be afraid, geliebter.
Before I ever saw you, when the water spirits told me you were coming...
I say to myself,
"This will be my man."
Liebling, you are my man. Mine.
- Nothing can change that.
- Never mind that nonsense.
How did you find out about me and the escape and the rest of it?
They know it in the town.
They're searching the forest and the lake.
Good wool.
And gloves.
Oh! Mm!
I never before had gloves.
Hmm.
Beautiful gloves.
- That is right.
- What's right?
What you were thinking.
That it would be safer to travel with me.
As a matter of fact, I- how did you know what I was thinking?
- It is there. Yes.
- The wagon?
We could travel by day. Back lanes.
Gypsy lanes.
They are not watched.
How far you think you go in these German officer's boots, huh?
- I do wish you'd stop reading my mind.
- They always look at your feet.
So frightfully disconcerting.
Like being found without one's trousers.
Oh, mein ser!
Why do you not trust me?
Afraid I'll have to.
I've no alternative.
Come then, into the wagon.
It is warm.
Good wagon. Not like others with holes. Come.
- Give me that.
- No. Tomorrow... in the morning, early, we get rid of it.
Now you are to sleep. Come.
- You didn't tell me your name.
- Liddie.
"Liddie"? If you don't mind,
I think I'll call you Lydia.
"Lydia"?
Huh. That is nice.
Jojezakad kedvedsen.
Tomorrow, I have wonderful coat for you.
Fine blue and yellow gypsy coat.
And boots and razor.
Razor belong to my second husband.
Thank you, I-your husband?
Where is he?
- He kill a gadze and they hang him.
- Good. I mean, poor fellow.
Good, huh? Huh?
Here you sleep.
Come, take off boots.
Lydia, what is a gadze?
Someone who is not gypsy.
Gadze sounds like a swear word.
It is, but not when he has blue eyes and brings you luck.
You know, I'm perfectly capable of undressing, you know?
Oh, this is comfortable.
It's very pleasant, indeed.
By Jove, I'm tired.
I must be getting old.
No! You are young and you are strong... and you are my beautiful man.
Please. Please, your hands.
Couldn't you arrange to sit on them or something?
As a matter of fact,
I'll sleep by the fire.
No. Outside, I must watch.
By the river.
- What for?
- The Nivashi.
- I beg your pardon?
- The Nivashi and the Pavushti.
- The spirits that live in the water.
- Oh, yes, yes, the pixies.
They sent you to me because I have no man.
- Oh, tommyrot!
- No, truly.
Five days now I travel alone.
Woman should not be alone.
So tonight, when spirits come out of river...
I will thank them for you.
What is that ghastly odour?
- My hair.
- Your hair?
Uh-huh. Look.
- Jasmine, violet.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
And cod liver oil! Oh, my word!
Good, huh? Tomorrow, on your hair, I put some.
Now you rest, mein ser.
What the devil!
- Lydia, your husband, did he have any papers?
- Papers?
Yes, you know, identification card or whatever I'd need if I took his place...
- in name only.
- No. No papers.
- Huh.
- They take them. But I have his clothes.
Clothes?
Lydia, do you think you could make me into a gypsy?
What idea!
What cleverness!
Huh! And in a gadze!
Oh, mein ser!
I can make gypsy out of log of wood.
Oh... and you are not log of wood.
What is that filthy mumbo-jumbo?
Stain, to make your white skin gypsy.
And in your ears,
J put holes.
Little holes.
- Holes?
- Yes.
For my husband's beautiful gold earrings.
When I finish, you will even smell like gypsy.
Now look here, old girl.
Let's not overdo this.
- Ow!
- Lay still.
There's no need to tear off my ears.
Come.
It hurt?
No. No, but I can still die of tetanus.
Tetanus?
I do not know. Come.
 Lydia, this awful coat!
Why, it's frightening!
Put it on.
- But where on earth did you get it?
- I stole it.
But do not worry.
I steal it from friend.
Then you did him a favour.
Well?
Oh, mein ser!
Oh, mein ser!
Jaj istenem!
Oh. Oh!
Look at yourself.
Oh. Oh.
- Not bad.
- Bad?
You are wonderful.
You are beautiful!
Mm! You look like wild bull.
Giris will be crazy for you.
But these eyes, they won't fool anybody.
They're blue, you know.
Keep them low.
Look humble. Gypsies do.
Gadzes teach us how.
- What now?
- Hmph.
- Now you push.
- I beg your pardon?
Go, push. Go!
Geliebter.
I just find name for you.
Janos Kalompa.
Janos Ka- oh, great Scott, Lydia.
Can't you do better than that?
- What's the matter with your husband's name?
- Uh-uh.
Dead man's name.
Bad luck. No.
Janos Kalompa.
Good.
He was young fiddler in Transylvania.
Oh... how he could fiddle!
That Janos.
How I loved him. Ha.
Come. Sit here.
- Come.
- I'm perfectly all right here, thank you.
- Oh...
- Now behave, Lydia!
- But I love you.
- Now look here.
We just simply cannot go on having these attacks of- well, these attacks.
- It's positively indecent.
- Oh, mein ser.
Now look, get this clear once and for all.
You simply must learn to behave like a good woman.
But I am good woman.
I just want to kiss you little.
Come, I show you. You will like.
You jolly well stay where you are!
If you dare to move as much as an inch,
I'll- I'll thrash you.
Oh... first you beat me, huh?
And then you'll be sorry.
Then we kiss and make up.
Here, take whip.
Giddap.
Stop, liebling.
Lydia, stop it.
Don't you know that's stealing?
Yes, stealing.
But I like apples.
Sit down. Come on.
# Ha te engem #
# Szint oly szivvel #

# Ha te engem #
# Szint oly szivvel #

Hmm, nice.
Oh, liebling, if you only knew words.
Mm, such words.
Oh, such love!
Oh, mein ser!
Uh!
Oh!
Tell my fortune.
Gypsy, tell my fortune.
I tell fortune. Come.
Now, you have good hand.
See? Line of life is strong.
But you have been in danger of death three times, huh?
Now I see happy, long life for you.
I see two husbands, huh?
Two? Oh, thank you.
- Giddap! Come on!
- Thank you.
Mama, mama! The gypsy told me I would have two husbands.
Ah, that's silly.
Don't pay attention.
Hmm. You know, she thought
I was really a gypsy.
It was earrings.
"You have been in danger of death three times."
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- Why?
Sometimes it's true.
You know, in England, for this sort of hocus-pocus, you'd go to jail.
I go here also. Many times.
In winter, not bad.
Tell fortune?
Fortune?
Lydia, please, I must get to Freiburg.
Let's get a move on!
These fools have money.
I get a little.
Is forbidden, but I try.
We don't need any.
I have enough money.
Of money there is never enough.
And also is woman's job to get money for her man.
- Tell fortune?
-  Come on!
Fortune?
Tell fortune?
Watch this.
Giddap!
You, get down. Get down!
Gypsy, tell my fortune.
Well?
Ah. Ah! Three times you've been in danger of death.
See? The line of your life in three places is broken.
Ja.
And I see two husbands.
Hey, wait a minute!
She takes our money, then doesn't tell us-
- Ah, I see girl here.
- Ja?
Fine girl, big.
Jaj istenem! Such a girl.
- Ja?
- Yes, love is waiting for you just inside door.
That is because her father keeps the windows locked!
Krausse! See what is going on with the gypsies.
Tell me, gypsy.
Will there be a war?
Yes.
You lout! You swine!
You get out of here!
Hold your head down, geliebter!
Do not let him see your face.
- Hold your head down!
- Get out of here!
We are going, sir.
We are going.
Wasting your time like that.
Now get back to your duties.
- Get out!
- We are going, sir.
Come on! Hup!
Come on, old boy.
Come on!
Come on.
Whoa. Whoa.
He kicked me, the swine.
He kicked me.
I will put curse on him. His blood will turn to milk and his bones crumble.
I'm sorry. I almost gave the show away, losing my temper.
That is because you are gadze, liebling.
You suckle pride and become ruler of worid at your mother's breast.
But he kicked you also.
Gadze pats his dog and beats gypsy.
In old days, they hunt us like wolves.
Do not forget that, liebling.
I shall remember it in the future.
One day in this accursed land they will kill all of us.
Come, liebling, come.
Come on, boy.
-  Stop. Stop here.
-  Whoa.
- Now what?
- Before we cross... you spit in river three times.
Go. Spit in river.
I shall do nothing of the kind.
Then we do not cross river.
- Lydia, don't you believe in God?
- Hmm.
Then don't you think the lord's prayer might do just as well?
Huh. You are my very clever boy.
You do both. Go.
Go. Spit in river.
Go, spit.
Three times. Go.
Good. Now we go.
Giddap.
Stop watching, I tell you.
Lydia, must you clean fish on the bed?
Why?
Is fine fish. Huh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Here.
Your friend not come, huh?
No. He was supposed to mark this signpost with three dots.
He probably had to walk.
I made much better time.
We'll have to find a place to camp around here.
- But if your friend not come?
- Then I'll have to do it alone.
- Do what alone, liebling?
- Oh, meet a man. Talk to him.
That man, he live far?
A few miles from here. We'll have to find a place to camp. I'm starving.
- There's old fish only.
- Oh, no, Lydia. Not fish. Not again.
You would not stop in village, buy meat.
Oh. Look, you get the wagon off the road and pitch camp.
I'll be back.
You will not go in village alone.
I'm not going to the village.
You just get a fire started.
Papa, the chickens!
Oh, you thief! You thief!
Ah! Mm!
You feel good, huh?
I have never been so utterly content in all my life.
You know, this was stealing.
Stealing, yes.
But I like chicken.
- Oh, mein ser!
- Oh, Lydia, please!
There's a fire somewhere.
I smell smoke.
So do J.
Careful, geliebter.
Let me speak.
Where are you two coming from?
From there, masters.
Come on.
Where are they?
Who, master?
- Are they in there?
- No.
Where are you two going?
We broke wheel.
We lost caravan.
We try-
- Anything to report?
- Not a trace of them, sir.
We're searching-
All right, all right.
Keep searching. Hmm.
What have we got here?
Schultz, the spotlight.
 Gypsies, sir.
Chickens have been reported
stolen from a farmer, sir.
Chickens, huh? Look, you bring in my chickens.
They're two English ones,
and J'll make you a sergeant.
Drive on, Schultz.
All right, hitch up.
On your way.
The rest of your filthy gang is camped by the river.
Thank you, masters.
Thank you.
Come on!
- Stop, liebling.
- Whoa.
What's the matter?
There's fires, campfires.
- Gypsies?
- Yes, liebling, like police tell us.
- Will we be safe there?
- No, no, it's better go away from here.
But I told you,
I have to wait for young Byrd.
Then it's safer stay with my people than on road alone.
Do not worry, liebling.
I tell them you are escaped convict.
Come on.
- Liebling?
- Yes?
When you meet him, you make your big, beautiful smile.
You say loud like this,
jo napot, brother!
- Say loudly to whom?
- Zoltan.
Who the devil is Zoltan?
- Zoltan?
- Yes?
He's brother of my second husband.
- Ah, the one who, uh?
- Yes, liebling.
You see this coat... this beautiful coat?
Well, I was wise woman of the tribe.
Very important. I am seventh daughter of seventh daughter.
Let us stick with Zoltan, shall we?
Yes, liebling.
Zoltan is chief of tribe... and with me wise woman, naturally-
- Naturally what?
- Nothing, liebling.
That what make him mad.
- So I hit him with shovel in the head and-
- Well, go on.
And while his senses are knocked out still a little I went away.
But first, I steal his coat for you.
Don't be silly.
You never even knew I existed!
Oh, yes, Nivashi tell me.
That is why I take coat.
- On you it is wonderful.
- I don't want the coat.
He can have the beastly thing back!
- Liebling, you do not understand.
- What don't I understand?
If Zoltan see on you his beautiful coat, he want to fight you for it.
And if he win, well-
- I go with coat.
- Don't worry.
I have much more important things to fight over than you and a coat.
Come on.
Liddie!
Liddie!
Liddie!
Jo napot, brother!
Ha, ha.
Ow!
Liebling. Liebling!
We beat him!
We beat him!

Look at our gadze.
Like real gypsy he becoming.
With fingers he eats.
- Fingers were made before forks.
- Likewise gypsies.
Ah, gadzes
I cannot understand.
Such a strange people.
I hear that every day they wash. Is true?
Yes!
Ohhh, not good.
Washing very dangerous.
When they put my father in Hungarian army... every day they made poor fellow wash.
He died young, before he was even 60.
- Did he really?

My tooth, brother, the one you knock out.
You keep it.
It makes us blood brothers.
Thank you very much, Zoltan.
I shall treasure it all my life.

- What is that thing?
Liddie keeps singing it to me as if she expected me to swoon or something.
I will translate for you.
# There is story #
# Gypsies know is true #
# That when your love #
# Wears golden earrings #
# He belongs to you #
# Old love story #
# That's known to very few #
# But if you wear these #
# Golden earrings #
# Love will come to you #
# By burning fire they will glow #
# With every coal #
# You will hear desire #
# Whisper low #
# Inside your soul #
# So... be... #
# My gypsy #
# Make love
your guiding light #

# Of golden earrings #

Give her my little present, brother.
Oh! Jaj istenem!
Oh! Liebling! Liebling!
Oh, mama! Look!
- What was that all about?
- It means she'll have lots of children.
My tooth brings special luck, brother.
I've had 30... and three.
Zoltan! Zoltan!
Zoltan! Zoltan!
Zoltan! The signpost!
I come from the signpost!
- This is the boy.
- The signpost!
- I come from the signpost!
- Yes?
The dots! The dots! On the signpost are three more dots.
- Who put them there?
- It was gadze with bicycle.
- You saw him?
- With my own eyes I see him.
Be careful!
There's soldiers working in the woods!
Liebling, be careful!
Liebling!
- Tell your fortune, master?
- No.
- Cross palm with silver.
- Look, will you please run along?
Master, at this moment you are in great danger.
Pump up your bloomin' bike, guv'nah?
- Aye!
- Good heavens!
- By Jove, that's you.
I mean, it is, isn't it?
- Yes, I suppose it is.
Oddly enough,
I sometimes doubt it.
My word, sir, that get-up.
Those earrings.
An absolute knockout, sir.
Really. Who is this?
Oh, yes, I forgot.
Miss Lydia, Mr Byrd.
How do you do?
- Lydia, better go take a look at them.
- I go tell their fortune.
Maybe they tell me something, huh?
- My word, sir.
- What that woman's done for me.
- Fortune, tell fortune.
- You just wouldn't believe it.
- Let's get on with this blasted bike.
- Fortune!
Standing there, we'll be knocked off like sitting ducks.
- Awfully glad you made it, son.
- When I saw those three dots of yours...
I went off in the bushes and did hand-springs, but really.
- And now for your friend, Krosigk, eh?
- Right, sir.
You write a note, give it to me.
I'll take it to him.
You? Oh, no, that won't do at all.
The whole point is Krosigk knows me.
He's one of my father's oldest friends.
He's known me since I was that high.
You'll stay here. Wait at the gypsy camp.
It's down by the river.
- Is that an order, sir?
- Don't be an ass. Of course it isn't.
I'm just telling you.
Don't talk, don't look, just give me your hand.
Ah, you have very lucky hand, master.
Rarely have I seen hand with so much good fortune.
You see this line?
That is your life. It-
My word, sir, you're a knockout.
An absolute knockout.
Liebling?
Liebling, last night they came to inn, the gestapo.
One was big, like hog.
They say here, he has scar.
Hoff. Come back.
Come back, I say.
Why your friend ride away so sudden?
Because he knew I'd-
I'd never let him go.
Lydia, something's happened to me.
It's terrifying, incredible.
- I read his fortune and-
- Yes?
Lydia, that boy's going to die.
I saw it in his hand.
How, I don't know, but there it was.
Lydia, I tell you, he's going to die, and I let him go.
Do not be sad, liebling.
If you see it, it is true.
There's nothing you can do.
Come, liebling. Come.

 There are no wings
on bicycles, liebling.
And that man,
this Krosigk, where he live...
is good five miles.
Give to your friend time.
Give to him time.
You know, Lydia,
I used to be a rationalist.
- What is that?
- Well, it's sort of believing... only in what you see or hear... or feel.
But lately, I've begun to suspect there are more things... in heaven and earth than I ever dreamed in my philosophy.
You learn much when you learn that.
You know, you never did tell my fortune.
You get back to your country... safe.
You still know what I'm thinking.
You are easy, liebling... very easy.
What else?
You will be famous and you'll never go hungry... except in your heart.
What else?
You have been in danger of death three times.
I can go on from there myself.
You're thinking
I'll be leaving you soon.
How you know?
You're easy, liebling, very easy.
Lydia, afterwards...
I mean, when I'm gone... would you go back to Zoltan?
- Would that make you unhappy?
- Yes! Yes, it would, very.
Oh! What would Zoltan want of woman whose heart is stone?
See? Already it is growing cold.
Oh, Lydia.
I want you to know that in these last few days...
I've been very happy.
Happier than I thought it possible to be.
And that's very odd because they've been days... of danger and uncertainty.
I don't suppose I've begun to realize it until... until now that my time with you is almost run out.
You are the most wonderful person I ever met.
Your generosity...
and your warmth
and affection... and your loyalty and devotion.
The way you spill over with it.
It's made me feel very good...
and very secure... and very inadequate.
Oh, you not know your sweetness.
You say something.
Maybe it is your head you turn...
and smile at me.
And then there's beauty in you like water in sun.
And it make my heart pour down into me...
'til I love you so.
More than I can bear.
Oh, liebling, liebling.
Byrd? Byrd!
Go in woods quick.
Leave him with me.
Krosigk, never got to him.
- Come on, help me get him away from here.
- No, no, go away.
Leave me. Find Krosigk. Tell him I-
Halt!
- There he is!
- Go away, liebling. Go away.
Before he dies he has got to talk.
Where is Denistoun?
- I told you I wanted him alive.
- I shot for the legs.
Rindvieh!
I think he's coming to.
Where is Denistoun?
Where is the colonel?
Get his shirt off.
I will make him talk.
Where is Denistoun? Where is he?
- Talk!
- No! No!
-  Where is the colonel?
- Right here!
Denistoun.
Dicky? Dicky, it's me, Denistoun.
It's no use to grieve.
This is way it has to be.
- Zoltan, get these away from camp.
- Uh-huh.
- Car too?
- Yes.
Bury this boy here in the woods and all of you get out of here.
You go to Krosigk, huh?
No! No! They catch you!
They kill you!
Go back to your people.
This isn't your war.
- Go on!
- Liebling.
So I asked myself... why was Byrd seen in the vicinity of Freiburg?
Not once, mind you, but three times.
Why is he hanging about?
- For whom is he waiting?
- For the other Englishman.
- Denistoun.
- Of course, but why?
Why meet here?
Why meet at all?
In their shoes, I'd be getting out of the country as fast as I could.
No, they have business here.
Business important enough for them to risk their necks.
But what kind of business?
And with whom?
With whom, gentlemen?
Hmm?
What would you say to our great humanitarian... that earnest disciple of brotherly love... the inventor of our new poison gas?
What would you say, my friends... to professor Otto Krosigk?
Yes, Herr Reimann.
Oh, of course you can come over. Not at all.
We shall be delighted.
Well then. Goodbye, Herr Reimann.
- What does Reimann want?
- He's coming over.
I'm worried, Otto.
He suspects you.
- We're being watched.
- Now, come, my darling.
There's nothing extraordinary in that.
Today in Germany, everybody is watched, even the watchers. Come.
Tonight would you be entertaining the chief of police... these Nazi party officials and elite guard officers... if you weren't forced to?
- They suspect, Otto.
- Let them.
And if they searched me, would they ever suspect this, uh... piece of money?
- Let me keep it.
- No, darling, I have got to have it handy.
I never know when and where
I may meet... Byrd.
And if Byrd doesn't show up?
If they have caught him and sent someone in his place to trap you?
They won't trap me.
If anyone else but Byrd comes...
I won't have anything to do with him.
Please, stop worrying, will you? Come.
Let's go back to our guests.
What are you two doing here?
I told you to get away.
- This man, you see him?
- No, too many people. Now go back.
Go back? Liddie say go in.
Go in, go back?
What is this talk, huh?
We go in and tell fortune.
Then you talk to Krosigk. Easy, huh?
No, go back.
Zoltan, it's not safe for you here.
Already not safe for me there.
Liddie break my head.
Whoa. Whoa.
Go on in, brother.
We waste good time.
Come.
Masters, ladies? Read your fortunes?
Read your palms?
Tell past, present, future.
- Beautiful lady, with your permission-
- You! Be off!
- All of you, get out of here.
- Wait, Herr Lieutenant.
- This may be very amusing.
- Nonsense!
These filthy gypsies.
These non-aryan swine.
We of the master race should not contaminate ourselves.
Our little policeman, chewing up the landscape.
Handsome soldier, like me tell your fortune, huh?
Jf you can make it interesting.
- With man like you, easy.
- Is it all right, Krosigk?
-  Of course, by all means.
- This I must hear.
 Ask her if there's
going to be another war.
- Tell your fortune, master, past, present or future.
- No, gypsy.
I'm not interested. Maybe you?
Not interested in an old Oxford friend,
Herr Krosigk?
- Or his son, Richard Byrd?
- Careful, it's a trick.
Go away.
- Get out of here, gypsy.
- I'm not a gypsy.
- My name is Denistoun. I'm an Englishman.
- Isn't that interesting?
- An English gypsy.
- I told you I'm not a gypsy.
You've got to believe that.
J'm Colonel Denistoun
of the British army.
A colonel with holes in his ears and rings in them.
That's a little hard for me to swallow.
But frankly, my good man...
I'm not at all interested in who you are or what you are.
 Certainly not,
and we don't want our fortunes told.
- We must go back to our guests, Otto.
- Wait! Richard Byrd is dead.
They shot him, tortured him.
He was on his way here to see you.
Why do you... tell me all this?
- There... there must be some mistake.
- There's no mistake.
I killed the two brutes that murdered him.
He counted on you, you because you're a patriot of humanity... rather than a tool of these war-mad Nazis.
That is dangerous talk, gypsy.
Look, there's going to be a war.
A war, do you hear?
Give me your horrible formula and Germany dare not use it.
You know that we won't!
Jt's your duty as a scientist,
as a humanitarian.
Do I get it?
I don't know what you are talking about.
Bekanntmachung des oberkommandos.
If ever I get out of this mess, if I get back to England...
I shall have to tell your friends, young Byrd's mother and father... just how their son died. I don't want to tell them he died for nothing.
War! Jt's war!
War!
- Did you hear that, Otto?
- Yes, my dear, I did, I did.
This gypsy's a traitor.
He'll get you into trouble.
No, my dear. No, he won't.
I'll report him to Reimann when he comes.
I know you think
I'm trying to trick you-
It's war, Herr Krosigk! On the radio, it just came over! Poland attacked us!
We are already across the Polish border!
Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!
- Deutschland ueber alles!
Hurrah!
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Sieg heil!
Sieg heil!
# Deutschland ueber alles #
# Ueber alles in der welt #
- You have it?
- No. Get out I'm in trouble.
- Our luck goes bad.
- Already around neck I feel rope.
You two get away and I'll- too late.
# Bruederlich zusammenhaelt- #
Good evening.
- I see everyone has heard the glorious news.
- Yes! Yes! Glorious!
On the radio, heil.
- Good evening, Herr Reimann.
- A little slow getting over, Krosigk.
Had to wait for a report on two of my men.
They were murdered while tracking down two enemies of the Reich.
Our enemies are all around us,
Herr Reimann.
Sometimes under our very noses.
How true. As a matter of fact,
I am very glad you came over.
- I just-
- The murderers of my men were two Englishmen... named Byrd and Denistoun.
The names mean anything to you?
To me?
I don't understand.
I once knew a Mr Byrd at Oxford, yes.
- But he is very old now.
-  Oh, you admit that?
Do you realize the borders are very closely guarded now that war is declared?
These men most certainly will be caught...
- and made to talk!
- Talk about what?
Who are they? Herr Reimann, that sounds very melodramatic.
Krosigk, we have reason to suspect... that they may have some business with you.
Really?
Then I insist that you post a guard around this house.
I must be protected at all times.
You're very clever, Krosigk, but-
They have been telling our fortunes... and very well too.
Get them out of here.
Gypsy! Wait.
With your kind permission.
Here. This is what you wanted... for telling my fortune.
And I believe it too.
Every word of it.
Let's get away.
Well, this is it.
From here on I travel alone.
What about you and your people?
This war's gonna make it difficult.
We separate, scatter.
Like water in sand.
- Country will swallow us.
- Brother, you've been a good friend.
I shall never forget it.
Farewell, brother.
And one day you take earrings from ears... but you find roots of them in your heart.
Goodbye, Lydia.
Goodbye, my dear.
I go with you to Rhine.
Without me, you do not get out of country.
- No, absolutely no.
- I am your luck.
- I won't have it.
- Ah, brother, with her, what good is words?
'Til your tongue hang out, you say "no."
In the end is "yes."
That I have found out. Now go!
Come, liebling. We must be in mountains before sun come up. Come.
Not much of a war going on.
Sentries pretty well under cover.
- Not safe to swim across.
- Lydia, you're not going to try it.
No, liebling, before I meet you...
I seldom wash.
No time learn to swim.
Let's find a place to wait until nightfall.
- I imagine this runs into the Rhine.
- Yes.
I'll follow the stream down to the river.
It's luckier when you stick close to running water.
Besides, the sound will cover my footsteps.
Oh, liebling.
There is spell on me.
My head go round and round... and I feel weak... and frightened.
To me nothing matter any more... only you.
All my life I believe if I do not love one man...
I love another.
But now is different.
Is like... like... having sickness.
No. You never knew what real love was.
And I never knew what life was.
Now we've become like each other.
We've merged into each other.
Gypsy, gadze. Gadze, gypsy.
It's all one, Lydia.
- Mein ser.
- Uh-huh.
Now it is dark.
No moon, no stars.
Clouds.
I told you my luck would keep you safe, huh?
- You worry when you swim, keep money dry, huh?
- Yes.
Here. Here. Put in here.
Now you make your way to Switzerland.
You'll be safe there.
- You too?
- No, the Swiss would intern me.
But you would be safe.
No, I can't.
You... you are only half gadze.
And I, half gypsy.
Because I say go.
Goodbye, Lydia.
O spirits of the earth and water... guide my beloved.
Make him strong like the oak tree.
Let him live in the beauty and vigour of his seed.
Sweet spirits of the earth and water...
I give you back my beloved.
- Paris.
- She was quite a woman.
Quite, Mr Reynolds, quite.
- But I thought you said you returned them to her.
- Did I say that?
 We will land in four minutes.
Fasten your safety belts please.
We will land in four minutes.
Fasten your safety belts please.
Lydia.
Oh! Oh.
Oh, mein ser!
Oh! Mein ser!
I think you never come.
Oh, I just leaving.
Oh, mein ser!
Oh. Oh. Oh.
Oh, ser.
Come on, Apple. Giddap.
Once upon a time when old Baghdad was new and shiny, there was a beggar and what a rascal!
He called himself the king of beggars.
Having convinced himself that he was a king of some kind,
He'd roam the streets at night seeking adventure disguised as a prince.
In a great palace in the city lived a great lady.
A beautiful lady.
And she had quite a time with this prince.
Of course, she didn't know that he was only a beggar.
Her lord and master was the Grand Vizier.
A very powerful man.
When you know him better, you won't wonder that she wandered.
On the throne sat the young caliph, ruler of this great empire.
But he was not content to sit and rule.
He wanted the truth about his kingdom and his people.
And to learn the truth, he also roamed the streets of Baghdad at night disguised as a gardener's son.
And one day in this disguise, he met his fate.
An adorable maid.
And who do you think she was?
None other than the daughter of that rascal, the king of beggars.
Here is the fabulous old city.
Let's cross the river with this caravan right into the exotic heart of romantic, fantastic Baghdad.
A caravan!
Look, a whole dinar.
Dinar, bah. Pigeon food. Look here comes the feed for elephants.
Round is the moon. 'Round goes the moon.
The wind and the rain and the moon
'round again.
Halt, the magical great of the earth.
Here's a creature who will talk thy mother-in-law to death.
She puts on her best feathers, and comes from nowhere only to greet nobility.
A thousand blessings, my benefactor.
May the golden cupboards of the water of life be open to thee.
Alms for the love...
The stench of my soul increases from dawn to dawn.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Hurry, hurry, the buzzards are waiting for thee.
Look, the rich dervish miser.
Not one dinar from him in twenty years.
I've been much too patient with him.
Get away from there, mongrel.
One moment, kind merchant, in the name of Allah.
Must the poor give away their blessings forever, oh great of heart?
Out of my way, beggar.
But this small boy looks hungry.
A little compassion.
Put that back.
As thou sayest.
Let the little boy starve.
What, already hatched?
How time flies.
Give me that.
- Very well, my friend, very well.
- No, give it to me.
All right, all right, but don't let it fall.
You know how young it is.
It's just a baby.
How did the donkey's ear lay an egg?
You're holding up the caravan.
Out of the way.
A thousand pardons, kind merchant.
...Alms for the love of Allah...
Did you see that?
That thief.
Sharp eyes, sharp ears, very useful.
Gold?
An embarrassment of riches.
Fate has been very kind.
Tonight I shall celebrate.
Moolah, take my place.
Moolah you can extract from the caravan.
Watch him, Feisal.
See he doesn't fall asleep.
You're not leaving with all these fine pickings?
I have a rendezvous.
Scum!
To the caliph I may be dirt but to dirt, I am the caliph.
Salam, dirt.
What are you doing up there, old cactus?
Looking for a sweetheart?
Never you do that again.
Marsinah.
- My little lotus bud.
- Good evening, father.
Open your pretty lips, my little dove.
- Delicious.
- And why not, my pigeon?
It's mixed with sugar and vinegar like the good and bad things in life.
Rose water to give it perfume, and sweet seeds for flavor.
And it's all put together by honey bees
I have working for you in a corner of the caliph's garden.
A special flock of bees?
Very special.
- And look what I'm making for you.
- Mm, delicious.
I thought you might come home late and be ravenously hungry.
What a pity.
I must go to a banquet tonight.
Again?
Again? As king of the world of magic,
I'm very much in demand.
How is this little hand going to look when you grow up and marry the prince I promised you?
Maybe he'll be hungry sometime.
Your prince is never hungry.
A little thirsty but never hungry.
I have a confession, father.
Let's have it.
I promised Karsha I would tell you.
I was looking over the wall without my veil.
That's why Karsha was on the ladder trying to see what I was looking at.
Outside those wall, my blossom, is a very ugly world.
Except in a palace of your own.
That's why I built the wall around you.
Leave it there.
Until your prince comes to batter it down and carry you off to a world as lovely as you are.
The fairy tale always comes true.
Never forget that, my little princess.
Now, I must dress for the feast.
Sorry, kitties, but he's going out with royalty tonight.
Thank you, my beauty.
Let me see how you look.
Oh, beautiful.
Now that you have me beautiful, off to bed with you and get your beauty sleep.
Blessings, my rose, sleep well.
I've hung a lovely moon in the sky for you.
Sometimes the old moon keeps me awake.
Turn your pretty little nose into the pillow or I'll come up and blow out the moon.
- Bah!
- Huh?
I said, Bah!
That's all I've heard you say in thirty years.
One of these days,
I'll say more than that.
Police, guards, police.
Police? I don't see any police.
What are you fighting for on a night like this?
I called them liars. They were liars.
So's everybody.
Not when you make them lose their jeppers.
Then they tell you the truth.
- Is that what you want?
- Yes, I want the truth.
Truth, my friend, is boredom.
Maybe so but it's exciting and worth fighting for.
Give me a man who laughs when he fights.
- Come and have some wine.
- Thanks, I will.
Hey, Prince...
Don't expect the truth from anyone here.
They're charming people.
They don't bother with it.
Charming people? They look like a bunch of back alley merchants and cutthroats to me.
To you? My friend, they are all nobility.
I don't recognize any of them.
How should a young elephant like you recognize nobility?
I go to all the parades.
Excellency, I have a place for you.
Salam, ladies.
I won't tell you their names but they're all queens in disguise.
Magic black eyes.
Take one look and turn away.
They're dangerous.
Don't worry. He told me I was the only girl in Baghdad.
So you are, my blossom.
Hardy young antelope I've fell in with.
What draggle tail part of the city do you come from?
Mind if I choose for myself?
Save me Laeida?
She is not in yet.
Drink some wine.
In a few minutes, you'll see a young beauty worth fighting for.
I hope I can agree with you.
Agree with me?
- The insolence.
- I'm sorry.
My friend, if she weren't a lovely sight to behold, she wouldn't be coming here for an evening with me.
Oh? Well, might I ask just who you are?
Keep it to yourself.
One of the princes of the empire.
I sit in the counsels of the caliph.
Oh.
You do?
Then you know the new caliph.
Tell me, what's he like?
The new caliph is a yahoo.
A yahoo?
His father left him a score of lovely ladies.
And what does the young gander do?
He turns them loose.
Bah!
Heart of a king should be big enough for all the women in the world.
If a king can't act like a king, he's a yahoo.
He doesn't tell you what to do about the ladies, does he?
My friend,
No one has to tell me what to do with the ladies.
You're sitting with the master.
Oh, magic.
And very handy in case of trouble.
You must see this.
I have secured a new meeting place -
a tower by the river.
Come at once.
Hassan will guide you.
Jamilla
Bad news?
On the contrary. It's from a queen.
I haven't seen her for...Oh, it's been much too long.
What about Lady Laeida?
Oh, she's late.
You'll have to take what's left.
She might even like you.
Thank you.
Farewell, my friend.
Say to the Lady Laeida, urgent matters call me.
Why didn't you wait for Laeida?
I have a rendezvous of my own.
Does the master approve?
Is she beautiful?
- The sweetest girl in Baghdad.
- Magnificent. Where?
In a boat tied up to a cypress tree.
Boat, romance in a bouncing boat.
Go away. Spoil the night for someone else.
Never let tomorrow break the spell.
And when autumn breezes hear our sighs, may our lips never say fare thee well.
Keep him near, never far.
Never leave, evening star.
His royal highness, the Prince of Hassir.
He's not the Prince of Hassir.
He's only the prince of liars.
But charming.
You may show him in.
You may enter.
..and when autumn breezes hear our sighs
...may our lips never say...
Jamilla, Lady of the Moonlight.
So we meet again, my prince.
Let me feast my eyes on you.
It really is you.
This is a pleasure.
I've tried giving you up.
How could anything so beautiful be so merciless, so cruel?
We have a week of delirious happiness and suddenly you're gone.
My nights are sleepless, my days burning sands.
I didn't know who you were, where you were.
I shouted the name Jamilla through every palace window.
From Tehran to Mosul.
There wasn't even an echo.
Finally,
I take the long journey home to Hassir eh, my own little kingdom praying for a thunderbolt to explode you out of my heart.
But no thunderbolt.
Charming.
I ride home.
I am desolate.
In my palace,
I have a corner I call the Garden of the Stars.
I like that.
There I sat night after night.
And with my astrologers...
A very stupid lot. They don't know anything about women.
But you do, my prince.
There never was another woman in all the world I couldn't forget but you.
You weren't looking for me in that cafe where they found you.
But how fortunate I was there.
It was the hand of fate.
Kiss me.
- Kiss?
- What else?
I stopped a fight in the street.
I took a poor old battered lad inside and washed the blood off him.
A foul, reeking place, yes, but I...
I couldn't leave him in the street, could I?
And you couldn't keep Laeida waiting, could you?
How could you profane this moment with chatter like that?
After the torture you've made me endure.
Adorable man, don't stop.
Don't ever stop.
I'd rather listen to you telling lies than to all the wise men with all the truth of the ages.
Beard of my ancestor!
No one calls me a liar with impunity.
Who are you, Lady of the Moonlight?
I must know.
You'll never escape me again.
I warn you to leave things as they are, prince.
I never leave things as they are.
The night is enchanting.
Have you ever been on the river when the moon is like this?
The river has romance from here.
Let it be.
That young lout I told you about.
Yes, you washed the blood off him.
He has a boat under a cypress tree.
They're possibly cripples by now.
My boat was built for the queen of Sheba.
Is it written that Solomon never went fishing with her at night?
What are you thinking?
Nothing.
Just listening.
So soft and so lovely.
Isn't your life always soft and lovely?
I don't know.
I've never lived before.
Who built the high wall around you?
My father.
Why?
To keep everybody out.
To keep me inside.
Is no one ever going to be allowed inside?
Oh, yes.
The prince I'm going to marry someday will batter the walls down.
I'd batter the walls down but I'm only a gardener's son.
That's why I'm laughing.
Where is this prince supposed to come form?
Kismet, my fate.
Where else?
You believe in fate, don't you?
I do indeed.
My father thinks he can give romance to fate.
I want a prince for my daughter and nothing else will do.
You've never told me much about your father.
If I said he was a beggar, then you'd think he was a beggar.
No I'm not.
He's the king of beggars.
He's a king of some kind.
Or he couldn't be your father.
If he ever knew the wall wasn't high enough...
He'd kill me.
No, darling, nobody's going to kill you.
If he knew I'd been kissed by a gardener's son...
Oh, well.
The moon is almost gone.
Take me home now, please.
- You wicked...
- Oh, Karsha.
Is this the first time?
Allah, look down.
I'm in love, Karsha.
Love with some poverty stricken camel boy? Your father would kill you.
But you're not going to tell him.
Swear to me me you'll never do this again or I will tell him.
Did you make such promises when you were in love, Karsha?
Go to bed, you.
Besides, if you tell father, he'll cut both our throats.
You get to bed.
You ought to be too ashamed to draw a breath much less sing.
There's no room in my heart for shame.
Who is this young creature anyhow?
Isn't he wonderful?
He can jump but who is he?
He's a gardener's son.
Salt of the world, a gardener's son!
Wait, his father's chief gardener of the palace, the caliph's gardener.
- What gets you up so early?
- I'm not up so early.
- No?
- No.
I haven't been to bed.
Ah, come, my friend, I...
If I'm your friend, why don't...what's that?
Brawling again. Why don't you stop it?
I've prowled mt last prowl.
I've found what I've been looking for.
All thanks to Allah.
So from now on, you can sleep in peace.
- You found what?
- I found a queen.
And such a queen.
What eyes! The kind our poets call deep pools.
Always thought they were crazy before now, but they're not.
I suppose queens do play around the streets of Baghdad at night.
Oh no, not this one.
I had to leap a high wall for my queen.
And here's something to make you more cheerful.
I want you to get in touch with our astrologers and tell them this is a wonderful day for a wedding.
And don't you let them tell you it isn't.
Wedding? Who is she?
What's the difference?
I know what she is.
Her name's Marsinah.
Good name, isn't it?
What about her family?
And her father.
Who is he?
If I told you he's a beggar, you'd think he's a beggar.
He's the king of beggars.
Are you serious?
Very serious.
King of beggars.
You'll have to conjure up some new title for this king of beggars.
But tell me more about the girl.
She's a queen, my friend.
Heart of a queen, mind of a queen, soul of a queen.
I suppose she has a body.
Ravishing, my friend, ravishing.
Well, you didn't mention the body first.
That's promising.
Blessings of the Prophet on your wedding day.
- Long life and great happiness.
- Thank you.
I'd better call off the parade to the mosque.
Oh no, we can't do that.
That would disappoint my people.
But the court's this afternoon.
We'll have to dispense with that.
That would disappoint the Grand Vizier.
What's the matter? You look worried.
I am, very much worried.
You committed a blunder yesterday.
- A very serious blunder.
- Did I?
Name of Allah!
You summoned the Grand Vizier of Baghdad to court like a common thief.
A thief's a thief.
But he's the most powerful man in the empire.
My father let this jackal skin people alive.
Taxes, tributes, plain robbery.
And I'm going to stop it.
But he hasn't even acknowledged your summons.
He'll laugh at you.
And he won't come.
He'll come.
Or I'll go get him myself.
And like doing it.
I can only repeat that he is the most powerful man in the empire.
Achmed.
Let me have this.
I want to keep it.
Her head was resting on your shoulder.
For the empire and her,
I will do my best.
And nothing on earth will stop me.
That was spoken like a king.
And why not?
If a king isn't a king, he's just a yahoo.
Yahoo?
What is a yahoo?
You won't find that word in books, Agha.
Blessings of the Prophet on this day of days.
This brand new caliph, this presumptuous peacock, has the gall to summon me to open court.
When he stands before the mosque today,
I want you to send an arrow through his heart.
But see that the arrow flies straight.
Yes, milord.
If you fail, your head will come off.
I will not fail, milord.
That will be the shortest career any caliph ever had in Baghdad.
- Good morning, father.
- Ah, my little lotus.
Fresh from the hills.
The dew is still on them.
I waited for the sun to open them up.
Enchanting!
- Aren't they gorgeous.
- Go on with you sining.
And how is my little nightingale this morning?
- In good voice?
- Too good.
What's troubling my little Marsinah?
She's not in the mood for learning.
My mind is wandering this morning.
I'm sorry.
Why not? Everyone's mind should wander on a morning like this.
I knew you'd understand, father.
And today, I am not your father.
Today I am the shah of Molla Bashi.
Bah!
And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, your excellency?
Word of thy beauty is blowing down the wind.
I am here to offer gifts at your feet.
It's lovely.
Where did you get it?
I never remember where I get anything.
Now, you sing for me.
Very well.
Bah!
Tell me, tell me little evening star, is this world as lovely as it seems.
Did some magic carpet from afar bring this love to the land of my dreams?
Keep your light forever in his eyes.
Never let tomorrow break the spell.
And when autumn breezes hear us sigh,
- Did you teach her to sing that song?
- I did not.
...lips never say fare thee well.
Where did that song come from?
How do I know?
I dreamed songs like that at her age.
- Where did she learn it?
- I don't know.
Something's happened.
Who is it? What is it?
If there's any trouble, there's no one to blame but you.
You brought her up on fairy tales.
You made fantastic promises.
Built walls around her then went roaring through Baghdad and forgot about her.
Forgot?
You can't forget her any longer.
Do you think she's going to wither away waiting for your fairy tales to come true?
She's waiting for her fate and all its splendor.
The fate for a beggar's daughter is a camel boy.
Silence, misery.
Let no one make hash of fairy tales, my rosebud.
They're the only things in the world that come true.
Alms for the love.
What's wrong with him?
Oh, him.
He worries me.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Everybody's in a gay and festive mood and you sit here.
What ails you?
Guess the rendezvous must have made him sick.
Maybe he drank too much.
I never thought I'd have a problem and no answer for it.
- He has a problem.
- What's that?
Oh. One of those things...
I never thought you'd have a problem.
I know the answer. Don't worry.
For a dozen years
I made golden promises to my little girl.
Suddenly she's not a baby anymore.
What about the golden promises?
A prince and nothing less.
A handsome prince, fabulously rich.
I spread a carpet of dreams before her.
This morning, I'm just a beggar.
Princes live in another world.
My rose will bloom for some camel boy.
He'll never know how sweet she is.
I guess he has been drinking too much.
It's the Caliph.
That man will never make another attempt of the kind.
I made sure of that.
Also, he can't answer any questions, can he?
Dead men tell no tales.
Feisal.
What was that gossip of yours about the big people?
About the Grand Vizier. He was invited to the court like any criminal.
That's what I said.
I think he just replied to the invitation.
He came within inches of being ruler of the empire.
I could tie my chariot to such a star.
- Lord of the Grand Illusion.
- Or we just do nothing.
There's only one place for the loveliest of daughters.
The household of the greatest of men.
The Grand Vizier?
You're closer to him today than you will be in a thousand years.
Now, by the glories of Paradise to come,
Allah hath opened the gate of action to me.
Lead me to a bazaar where they trade in royal silks.
Jewels from India, beads from Damascus, sashes from Constantinople, turban cloth from Vocarra.
My Marsinah was born to make a palace dance.
Allah, save us.
That, my friends, is the golden promise of a king, and the word of a king is good.
Water, water, it's good.
I never knew it was like that.
Yeah well, I had a bath.
Say, Bobo, why are we hiding here in a public bathing place?
Don't worry. This is one place they'd never look for us.
- No?
- Police, police!
Police, police!
They're here, the police. They're here.
Why not police?
There was an attempt on the caliph's life this morning.
They're looking for accomplices everywhere.
Attendant.
Attendant.
Yes?
Yes, your highness.
One of my men tells me the police are here.
They're looking for a beggar for robbery.
Tell the captain I wish a word with him.
- At once.
- What?
There's a wise proverb:
Seize the horns of the charging bull.
Your highness, the captain of police.
Why do you enter a place where weary travellers relax?
Must the peace of the hammam be disturbed?
- It's a matter of duty.
- Duty?
In my country, I allow no such impertinence. What duty?
We are looking for a thief.
Must have stolen the sacred jewels.
No, milord.
Apparel of great value.
Trinkets a rat steals and a captain becomes a ferret?
In my country my captains don't annoy visiting royalty chasing petty thieves.
Look int he yard.
See if my elephant is still there.
Your highness, I did not know.
You didn't know.
What's happened to Baghdad?
My last visit here, eleven years ago, when I was a day's journey away, the police of Baghdad knew I was coming.
Your highness, no elephant.
By the dried skin of the hyena.
Have I come a thousand parasangs to visit the Grand Vizier only to be robbed?
I demand safe conduct. and another elephant.
If your soul isn't too weasel to stop this rat catching, send a messenger to Mansur's palace.
And say the Prince of Hassir has arrived with toot sweet.
On matters of great importance.
Very well, you shall have your escort and you shall have your elephant.
But now...
- I want privacy.
- Very good, your highness.
Is that carpet for us?
No, that's for the elephant.
Tell the merchant the tax is direct.
Unless they pay it immediately, it will be my personal pleasure to roll their heads through their bazaar.
What do you want?
How large a guard shall I prepare for your visit to the royal court?
You should know better than that, captain.
- But, milord.
- Forget the summons to court.
This young peacock is beginning to spread his tail.
He just might send the police after me.
It'll give him a chance to find out I'm the police.
What is it?
His royal highness, the Prince of Hassir.
Hassir, Hassir? He must come from the far ends of the world.
That's the farthest corner of the empire, my lord.
Did he send a messenger for an appointment?
No, milord.
These heathens have customs but no manners.
Yes, milord.
Let's give him a royal reception.
Let's amaze him with it.
I wonder what this barbarian wants to have travelled so far.
His royal highness, the Prince of Hassir.
I'll wager he's been preparing a long speech all the way across the desert.
A long, horrible speech.
Welcome, your highness.
A wide brow proclaims an open heart.
May heaven trust me, your lordship.
I never ask prosperity where it comes from.
Right, milord.
The devil could do you a good turn now and then.
That they may be seated.
I have a contemptibly small gift.
My caravan is delayed.
So if you will accept this in the meantime,
I would be most honored.
This is exquisite.
This is really fine.
- Good hands made this.
- Very young hands.
Is the design a copy?
Copy, milord? It's a creation.
She did all of it.
She?
It's a gift from the loveliest girl in Hassir.
Perhaps in the empire.
If I guess right, there's a mission you want me to perform.
- Is there, milord?
- Yes.
You want me to propose the lovely young girl for the caliph's household.
Milord...
But you've come at a very bad moment.
The caliph does not love me as he should.
At the moment.
Milord...
If I wish to visit the caliph,
I will visit the caliph.
Splendid, splendid, your gift honors me.
Will your highness honor me by accepting eh...
These?
I am overwhelmed, your lordship.
Alfife.
The living isn't very good on the journey from Hassir to Baghdad, is it?
I once knew a magician in your province.
His name was Abdul Laka.
How is he?
The one with a beard like a field of ripe corn?
No, no, no, he had a short eh... scruffy wisp of a beard.
Oh, that Abdul. The brigand.
He stole so brazenly, my executioners had to cut his hands off.
- No.
- Bled to death in public.
That should teach him a lesson.
Let's drink to poor Abdul.
We have the finest wine, music and dancing.
- Dancing?
- You like dancing?
It's the flowers on the mountaintop.
Then you're about to see the finest in the kingdom. I have scores of them.
My kind of dancers don't come in scores.
- No?
- No.
I'll wager you haven't anything like this in your pastures.
The girl who made you the gift makes these look like swamphens.
Swamphens? These girls were selected from every royal house in the empire.
Milord, my little girl would be a queen among these.
Great dancing takes brains and heart.
Alfife.
I have a great dancer.
She has brains but no heart.
Say to her gracious majesty
I have a distinguished visitor.
The prestige of my court is sinking.
Say that I am pleading that she save the glory of the court.
Your ladyship?
Well?
I'm commanded to request that you appear in the hall of the white columns and dance.
I'm very sorry.
I'm not in the mood for dancing.
But it is for a distinguished guest.
Must I call Hassan?
We've been robbed, lord.
Alfife, one moment, please.
The royal merchants have been robbed.
They want justice.
Tell them to wait.
I have troubles enough.
Quiet, quiet.
Her ladyship is not in the mood.
Salt of my ancestors! A man who cracks a whip over an empire.
If I cracked a whip over this lady, she'd take it right out of my hands.
It takes a great man to admit it.
She's a gift from Macedonia.
I can't offend Macedonia.
That sounds more like the caliph than your lordship.
Well, upon my soul!
You all stay. Watch the dancing and have some wine.
Why do you continue to deprive us of the pleasure of your incomparable dancing?
Didn't Alfife tell you?
Doesn't the look of desperation in my eyes soften your mood just a little?
I'm in a very pleasant mood.
Very.
I have a charming and distinguished guest.
It's your luck that he pleases you.
Pleases me?
He scorns my dancing girls as swamphens.
Oh, a man of judgement.
Lady Jamilla, I have granted you exceptional privileges.
You granted nothing.
You have an agreement with Macedonia that I should do that thing.
And you have agreed never to come to this tower except at my invitation.
I'm waiting patiently for the invitation.
And as far as dancing is concerned...
You have ladies who dance when you strike the gong.
I don't.
But, Lady Jamilla...
I give your lordship my answer politely.
It's outrageous hospitality.
He's had a long hard journey and we mustn't disappoint the Prince of Hassir.
The Prince of Hassir?
Now, don't try to trick me.
There's no such thing under the sun as the Prince of Hassir.
I'm absolutely certain.
There's no such man.
There's nothing more to be said.
Some day I'm going to cut your head off even if I lose Macedonia.
Hassan has something important to tell you.
Hassan? I'll see him.
She says there is no Prince of Hassir.
Lady of the Moonlight.
Lady of the what?
Well, she came down from some celestial spot.
She didn't come down. She came up.
Marvelous.
Pity custom forbids my telling her so.
We are bigger than our customs.
Tell her so.
Don't be afraid.
She doesn't bite strangers.
Your lordship is great indeed.
Lady of the Moonlight.
You are ravishing.
I warned you to leave things as they were.
How could you do this terrible thing to me?
What have I done?
When you said you shouted my name in the windows of all the palaces,
I knew it was nonsense but I loved it.
To me, you were all the romance of old Baghdad.
When I was bored to exhaustion,
I could escape and find you.
You were priceless.
Jamilla, listen to me.
No, no, no.
This is farewell, my friend.
What a shame.
I am just as much the Prince of Hassir as I ever was.
As much, no more.
You're a charming liar at times.
Don't be absurd.
The Grand Vizier doesn't roll out the red carpet for stray vagabonds.
When my royal blood is up, no one can deny me. And no one does.
Nothing has changed.
You mean you hoaxed your way in here?
This is magnificent. You took your life in your hands to see me.
A poor risk for such a reward.
Then I must see you tonight.
You must tell me all about this before you forget any of it.
What you said, every word.
What the great man said.
Oh, this is wonderful!
I'll laugh in his face every time I look at him.
You'll never laugh in his face again.
We're leaving tonight you and I for my Garden of the Stars.
If you will accept this little gift, beautiful dancer, it may remind you of the pleasure you gave a weary traveller.
You're too gracious, your highness.
Well?
Well.
She's a great artist, milord.
Then we'll hear no more about the maid of Hassir.
Of course, she's much younger.
But she's queen of them all.
You're not suggesting
I get rid of Jamilla?
No, no, no, my lord.
But of course, fate moves queens into place and out again so...
You never can tell.
We're too shaking with Macedonia right now, aren't we?
I didn't come here to give you the shakes.
I just wanted you to see the girl, that's all.
To see her dance. And when she sings, my lord, the angels are still.
In the name of the seven burning lakes, do you expect me to travel all the way to Hassir to see this paragon?
No, she's here with me in Baghdad.
Then before you start singing her praises all over again,
I'll send for her in state.
That's something I must do myself, if you don't mind.
No, anything you want, of course.
The superlative hand that fashioned the gift shall have something from me.
Here.
Give this to the miracle of all girls and say to her that never before in it's history has this palace held its breath as it does now.
And what's her name?
- Marsinah.
- Marsinah.
And now gentlemen, to the Princess Marsinah.
This needlework!
What material!
I poured all my love into it.
Oh, Karsha.
I like it myself.
Listen.
Listen. Oh, he sounds happy.
Sounds like an extra glass of wine or a new fairy tale.
Here, you come take that off.
That's not for everyday.
Please, Karsha, I want father to see it.
Ah, my blossoming flower, greetings, my unblossoming cactus.
Salam, salam, salam.
Happiness. Where did you get it?
To those of royal blood, one never asks,
"Where did you get it?"
Those pearls.
Gorgeous.
Who was it said every son's a blessing, every daughter a desolation?
Who'd dare say anything so wicked?
I wouldn't barter you this day for all the sons of all the guardians, all the nobles or... am I talking like a king?
Who went crazy.
Silence, cactus.
Or I'll call my slaves to chop your head off.
How would my little princess like to live in a palace?
With pillows of ostrich plumes, in courts of marble with ceilings of molten gold.
She'd go blind in the eye, enslaved.
Come on, slave, the feast. Ha, quiet.
Your wishes, princess?
I shall have a sherbert.
In my costliest china bowl.
With exquisite spoons made from the pear tree.
Here is pheasant from Mazanderland.
Here are the choicest bites of the wild antelope.
I get the bellyache just listening to them.
So, I go roaring through Baghdad, do I?
Such a roar was never heard through Baghdad.
Please, father, tell me what did you do?
I have had wine with the greatest man in Arabia.
Wine, music, he even brought out his dancing girls.
I looked at them, I thought of you.
Milord, I said, these are swamphens.
He said, "Off with his head."
I said, "Wait", said I, "Wait."
Not until you've seen the Princess Marsinah and so...
He sends you this.
With his compliments.
Now, my lotus, my little pigeon, you are to dance for the Grand Vizier!
I?
I dance for the Grand Vizier?
I promised you when the time came, a king should bow his turban to the dust for you.
All day your father has been stepping from one mountain peak to another.
But don't be uneasy, my little Marsinah.
You'll dazzle them all.
Open up in the name of justice.
This way, quick!
In here, both of you.
Quick!
The police, police.
- I knew they wouldn't be far behind you.
- Stay there.
- The robber.- The rascal.- That's my tunic
- My shoes.- My ring.- My turban.
- He stole my purse.
- Quiet.
They're lying dogs, captain.
These clothes in this shack?
These clothes are mine and those too.
You can have them back. Here...
Come along, you're under arrest.
Alfife, this is an outrage.
I'm a man of religion and peace.
Three doomsday break if I lie.
Father.
I'll be back, my little one.
Don't worry.
I'll see my friend, the Grand Vizier.
He'll send them all where they belong.
Come along.
I knew it. I knew it.
Karsha.
- Karsha.
- Come, my little one.
No, no, I must get help.
The king of beggars.
- Gardener?
- Yes?
- What is it?
- This young lady wants to see you.
Wants to see me?
Yes, please.
A flower from the caliph's garden.
Is that what she was?
Here.
Thank you.
That has a blessing.
Where can I find your son?
My son?
This garden is the only wife I ever had.
Thousands of these flowers are my only children.
Oh, see what you've done.
Forgive me.
Milord...
My friend, I didn't believe it when they told me.
I've seen princes made and unmade pretty fast in my time.
But never with a speed like this.
Go ahead.
The accusers may speak one at a time.
Quiet.
I have heard the accusations.
And what has his highness of Hassir to say?
And what of the magician?
Can he juggle his way out of this?
Come, speak.
Milord, when the trick fails, when it's exposed, the magician's a poor thing.
The other gift, the bracelet you gave the princess, milord.
Oh, no, hang it around your neck again.
I did enjoy you.
You surprised a man pretty hard to surprise.
And you remember poor Abdul?
Yes.
You know the law.
If a man steals, you cut off his hands in front of his victims.
My hands!
Actually, you'll cut my heart out.
If a man knows the law, he should think of that before he steals
Milord!
It is no pleasure to see rare talent cut off before its time.
But it is so written in the law.
There can be no compromise.
What is it?
A message from the imperial palace.
I have come from the all highest of the center of the universe to give his compliments to you.
He has sent a very substantial number of his royal guard.
His serene highness is thus assured that you will be conducted to his presence in a manner befitting your exulted position and the distinction of your house.
Did you say royal guard?
By the express orders of the caliph.
Your palace is now completely surrounded by your escort.
Milord.
Milord, shall we proceed?
What are we waiting for?
Cut off his hands and dismiss the court.
Milord, wait, these hands can serve you.
Silence, mountebank.
But I can tell you of my master in Morocco.
He toppled the king off the throne.
When everything else had failed.
Halt.
My friend, your story will have to be exceedingly good.
Or it will be exceedingly short.
It's both, milord. It's good and short.
But...
I need my hands to tell it.
And now, what did your master of Morocco do?
While the king was amazed at the lightning in one hand, the other drove a dagger through his heart.
Proceed.
I heard the king's messenger.
The words sounded fair but...
Your lordship is trapped.
Before the mosque this morning, a mans' head rolled in the gutter.
He'd fumbled his job.
You told me yourself how much the caliph loved you.
Of course, you know you've just written your death warrant.
Unless I can serve you.
What you want done in Baghdad today, only these hands can do.
Get me before the king today and you will rule the empire by sundown.
- You have courage, my friend.
- I have for this, milord.
I'm keeping a golden promise.
I'd rather die than break it.
- A promise to whom?
- To my daughter, milord.
Dear to me beyond the hopes of Paradise.
The highest place in the world I've promised her since she was a baby.
If you serve me today,
I'll make you a prince of Islam, and she can have anything she wants.
If I send this peacock to Paradise one split second later, I'll be dead.
You risk that, of course.
Now, what do you want?
This and it must be done rapidly.
My Marsinah brought here in state.
I must see her installed not as one of your dancers but as queen.
As head of your household.
But what about the tiger cat?
Leave the tiger cat to me.
Another assignment in magic?
You met the lady for only a brief moment.
It was love at first sight, milord.
I can always tell.
Very well, my friend, very well.
Your princess Marsinah shall be brought here in state.
And now some wine.
That means good things.
Like a bursting sunrise.
You've heard many fables, child.
But the sands never lie.
What's that?
Have you risen from the dead?
Marsinah, my child, there's nothing to be distressed about.
A word to my friend, the Grand Vizier, and those hounds went off yelping.
Tears, my poor baby?
Has this croaking old parchment frightened you?
I've good news for you.
The greatest of all news.
You are to be queen of the household of the Grand Vizier.
Think of it.
The Princess Marsinah.
Not just one of a score of dancing girls.
But queen of them all.
Don't lie to her anymore.
I do not lie, cactus.
Before the sun goes down, she'll be the greatest lady in Baghdad.
- Why must you make life so horrible?
- Marsinah, it is written.
I love you, father, but I can't obey.
What's this? What's happened?
She's fallen in love.
That's what's happened.
Who? When?
I'll send him floating down the river without his head. Where is he?
He told her his father's the royal gardener but he lied.
The royal gardener has no son.
I want to put you on the mountaintop but you choose the gutter.
Don't you see how miserable I am?
My little Marsinah,
I built these walls to protect you.
Every day of your life,
I've tried to bring a world of dream in here.
And now those dreams are coming true.
I know what life with the gardener's son will mean.
Slavery, poverty, ugliness.
A few short years and life will be over.
That's not true.
Leave me alone.
- Captain of the guard.
- Father.
Bring them in.
Don't make me do this.
For this I've risked my life a dozen times today.
For this I descended a bottomless pit.
The bargain is made.
You mean I...
I'm to marry a...
I'm giving you the place in the sun
I promised you.
Deliver this maid to the Grand Vizier.
They don't have to touch me.
I'll go.
When will she arrive?
Just before sunset.
After the gardener's son has battered the wall down.
The messenger has returned.
You may speak.
You majesty, this beggar we've been searching for seems to have vanished.
Ridiculous.
Beggars don't vanish from Baghdad.
He must be found and found today.
In your search, did you learn anything about him?
He calls himself king of beggars.
He masquerades at night as the Prince of Hassir.
He is also quite a magician.
Double your efforts.
Set a watch around the house where he lives.
You may go.
You're not serious about this wedding after what you've just heard?
Nothing can change my mind.
I shall bring her here myself.
In the name of Destiny, you...
It's insane to risk your neck in the streets.
You can send a thousand men with me if you like.
But the gardener's son is going to lead her through the royal gardens.
I'll tell her nothing till we're here.
I want the memory of this day to live in her heart forever.
I'm ready, milord.
Where's the princess?
- She's being costumed.
- Good.
Your appearance in court has been arranged.
The caliph has accepted your petition.
And he...
What are you laughing at?
There's vast excitement among the ladies because of the Princess Marsinah.
Her highness, Queen Jamilla, refuses to leave the tower, milord.
You hear? She won't leave the tower.
There's a good deal at stake.
I think she'll have to.
Right, but what are you going to do, put her under a spell?
Exactly.
As soon as you've formally dethroned her.
There are formalities, milord.
All right.
Stay here. I'll take care of the formalities.
Don't you dare come up here.
Or I'll drive a dagger through your heart.
But, Lady Jamilla...
I shall stay in this tower as long as it pleases me.
And only when I decide to leave, shall I leave.
Oh, you decide.
Remember I told you I would cut your throat even if I lost Macedonia.
Now the time has come.
- I'll call out the...
- Never mind.
I have decided to leave.
You what?
Jasmina.
Marsinah.
Prince Charming.
Let no one make hash of fairy tales, my rosebud.
Your veil, please.
You should have brought a poet to talk about her.
Arise, my dear.
And be honored.
From now on, this distinguished young lady is queen of the household.
There will be a marriage ceremony later in the day.
A word to your father before
I lead you to the tower.
Once, milord, there grew a single rose in a beggar's garden.
He swore it should never bloom for some camel boy.
How do you do things like this?
Magician.
You brought this girl here?
Yes, I brought her here.
So that I would be free?
It was a bargain.
I was going to tear the place to pieces.
And I would have.
If I hadn't seen you.
I told you you couldn't escape me.
Can a woman escape her destiny?
The name of Jamilla still echos in palace windows.
And the Garden of the Stars is written in the sand.
I'll come back for you in an hour.
Another hour here?
I'm a deposed queen.
Forgive me.
First I've a duty to perform.
It's not as simple as I thought.
Was is this duty?
My part of the bargain.
If I live through it,
I'll be here.
You'll live through anything.
There's a secret entrance.
My slave will be looking for you.
Near the eastern gate.
If you don't see me within the hour,
I'll be dead.
You'll be alive when the man in the moon is forgotten, my beloved.
The Lady of the Moonlight will be waiting.
Come quickly.
Did I hear you laugh?
Oh, no.
Why tears at this great moment?
You've reached about the highest place a woman can have in this kingdom.
What good is a high place if your heart breaks?
We women are not supposed to have hearts, my dear.
Who was he?
Nobody.
A gardener's son.
I see.
You do strange things in Hassir.
Hassir?
Yes, your province.
I've never heard of the place.
But you have been formally presented by the Prince of Hassir.
I've never been out of Baghdad.
But who's the man who brought you?
You mean my father.
- Your father?
- Yes.
He didn't bring me from anyplace but the shack we live in.
But who is your father if he's not the prince of Hassir?
My father is a beggar.
A beggar?
Yes, he sits on a rock before the beggar's mosque.
This magnificent man a beggar.
Oh, how wonderful.
How wonderful! A beggar!
And his daughter a queen.
What fun.
Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you.
Come on, cheer up.
Hear that?
Come here.
The song of ceremony for the new queen.
You're supposed to sing it.
I...
We expect it.
Sing for them.
Like the willow in the wind,
I have a weeping.
Like the willow in the wind moaning low
Like a willow leaf, love is ever brief
So my heart weeps away never sleeping
Weeps away like the night winds that blow
Like a willow leaf
Love will come to grief
Only yesterday spring was here to stay
The voice is good.
I could do with a happier song.
Youth can be sad without rhyme or reason.
Now that I've signed the marriage agreement,
I've fulfilled my part of the bargain.
See that you don't fail to do yours.
Not I, milord.
If I don't juggle you out of trouble,
I've done nothing for her.
That's true, that's true. Alfife.
Double the guard around the tower.
And what's so amusing?
I was thinking if I fail with the caliph, they'll kill me.
If I don't then your lordship will do it.
I might not.
Milord, I've an inheritance.
My father lived to be 100, my grandfather 110.
They won't be expecting me in either place for years.
They won't be ready for me.
Find courage, my friend, find courage.
Kismet.
His lordship, the exalted
Grand Vizier of Baghdad.
Let every tongue be silent.
His serene highness, commander of the faithful, lion of the imperial forest, rider of the spotless horse, shadow of Allah on earth, ruler of all Arabia.
If it please the all highest...
The ruler of faithful is not to be addressed except at his own request.
As you well know.
Your case is third on the list, your lordship.
But to summon me here on a few hour's notice, shows contempt for my great office.
In the name of dignity and high justice,
I demand time to prepare myself against the accusations, no matter what they may be.
I will always listen when a man says,
"In the name of justice."
I'll grant you the time you ask.
And I'm going to tell you what you're accused of so you'll know how to prepare.
But during the time I'm granting you, all duties and power of office is stripped from you.
The seal is worthless.
But this is outrageous.
You are accused of brutal taxation, robbery of the poor, years of corruption.
My witnesses are here by thousands.
And I have it from their own lips throughout the kingdom.
When you have an answer you think we should hear, let us know.
When your serene highness apologizes to me, may I hope that he does it as publicly as this.
I will not keep your fate a secret I promise you.
Number one on the divan program, is the case of Alwah, the woodchopper against Wapu the barber.
Which is the barber?
I am the barber, your excellency,
I am the barber.
State your case.
Great keeper of all justice, this miserable woodchopper, he pays my barbershop a visit.
He inquires how much will be the charge to shave him and his friend.
I stated a most reasonable price.
I shaved the rascal and I said,
"Now, bring in your friend."
And what does he do? He brings in his ass and says, "This is my friend."
Well, Alwah?
Most high and just,
Two moons ago,
I brought to this b-barber a load of wood on the back of my friend here.
He bargained for all of the wood on the ass' back.
In those very words.
So this hard-hearted b-barber he took also my pack saddle saying that too was made of wood.
He said...
Agha, have this overly smart barber shave the woodchopper's friend.
The next case is a petition from a stranger.
It is a tradition in Baghdad to hear strangers without delay.
The man is a magician from far off Morocco.
And craves assignment as conjurer to the imperial court.
This magician is the beggar we've been searching the city for.
The next case is your father-in-law.
The Prince of Hassir?
That roustabout who kicked me and called me a yahoo?
My father-in-law.
The heavens are having fun.
Perhaps not.
His petition came from the valets of the Grand Vizier.
Let's be on guard.
I shall not weary your serene highness.
I shall conjure before the eyes of the lion of the imperial desert only such feats of magic.
He's gone.
He's gone.
Now, oh rider of the spotless horse
On my right is this beautiful young lady and here, the handsome lad she loves. but it's springtime, your highness and with your royal permission.
Let me out of here!
Hey, let me out of here!
Let me out.
Thus demonstrating to the all highest that nothing in the world is real.
Excellent, excellent.
And now, oh, prince of true believers,
I will show you a feat so incredible it has staggered all the rulers of the world.
But the king must watch closely.
May a stranger beg humbly to approach?
The king's eyesight is excellent.
Proceed.
What use if the king can't see?
Proceed.
Watch the kerchief closely, milord.
- See amazing things it can see.
- Halt!
Serene highness,
I am a failure. My chance is a nothing unless you examine the kerchief closely.
Stay where you are.
Let him come up.
Allah reward thee, commander of the faithful.
Before your eyes,
I will produce a forest and put it on the mountaintop.
I now summon the gods of thunder.
- And from these changing colors...
- You will produce a knife.
You showed me the trick last night.
Remember the yahoo?
Don't kill him. Bring him to me.
Bring him to me.
I want silence.
Let every tongue be silent.
This is the second attempt today.
It is clear life is in the hands of fate.
Praise Allah.
Before this fool's execution,
I want him to hear something.
You were told of a royal wedding today.
That wedding will still take place.
I've combed the corners of Baghdad for this man.
And while he was plotting with my enemies,
I was arranging to make his daughter queen of the empire.
That girl must disappear immediately.
The Grand Vizier, stop him.
Stop him. Don't let him get away.
- Don't worry about him.
- Don't let the Grand Vizier get away.
Our chancellor will now give you the order of the day.
- Proceed.
- Guards, get him!
Where's Marsinah? She goes with us.
Quick, lead the way.
Come back, you fool.
He'll kill you.
Admit no one until we get the beggar's daughter out of here.
And his highness can try and find us in the wilderness of the desert.
We'll soon find out who rules in Baghdad.
Marsinah.
Marsinah.
Here's the key. Let me open it.
Marsinah.
The Grand Vizier.
Where's the girl?
Where is she?
Alfife, call the guards.
Alfife, the guards!
Alfife.
He died laughing, Excellency.
We'll see if you can do the same.
I've heard enough. Bring him in.
Yes, the most beautiful pearl in my entire kingdom.
Release him.
You may rise.
What have you to say?
Your highness,
You expect to be hanged, of course?
Thou art the lord of my neck.
Hanging is much to easy a punishment for you.
Milord, torture?
You love Baghdad, don't you?
With the breath of my life, milord.
Rather a dead beggar in Baghdad than a living monarch of the wilderness.
Have you ever seen Hassir?
Hassir is the dullest, drowsiest, most desolate corner of the empire.
So...
You're exiled.
To Hassir.
And if you're in Baghdad one second after sundown, that second will be your last.
Exiled?
From Baghdad?
- Oh, milord, bring on the hangman.
- Silence!
From this moment, you are our Prince of Hassir.
Prince of Hassir?
You had a lot of fun being Prince of Hassir.
Oh, most exalted,
I will make this forgotten spot into a paradise.
The desert shall blossom like the rose.
The odor of decay will vanish before a breeze of orange blossoms.
There will thy name be honored.
Yes, but if you're caught in Baghdad one second after sundown, that second will be your last.
They're coming, Jamilla. Karsha.
He's coming, Karsha!
Jamilla!
Marsinah!
Father.
Marsinah.
Father.
You're alive?
Yes and so are all my promises.
Round is the moon, 'round goes the moon, the wind and the rain to the moon 'round again,
Karsha.
Father, it's the gardener's son.
But why do you kneel?
It's the revered one, the rider of the spotless horse.
The Caliph of Baghdad himself.
The ruler of all Arabia.
Why, it...
Marsinah.
Now, say goodbye to your father.
Father.
My baby.
Blessings of the Prophet on your wedding day, my little one.
Your highness, the sun goes down.
Your wedding gift, my lotus.
And may Allah smile on you both forever.
Look.
Well, it's...
It's the most beautiful pearl
I've ever seen.
Hurry up, man. I thought you were lost.
All Baghdad
Well, wishes are horses.
Beggars can ride.
The daughter of a beggar
The daughter of a king.
Farewell, Baghdad.
If you're ever again in trouble, send for me.
Sundown, your highness.
This way.
Got him. Right on the nose.
It's all right. He had it coming to him.
He's always making trouble.
One of these days, Tarzan'll get mad... and that'll be the end of Mr. Leopard.
Cheetah, don't get too rough.
He's only a baby.
You better stop, Cheetah.
If his mother shows up, she'll eat your head off.
Tarzan's going for a swim.
Swim.
Cheetah, stop teasing Buli.
Cheetah, I warn you now.
Stop teasing Buli.
I suppose they just wouldn't be happy if they weren't wrangling all the time.
Buli happy, Cheetah happy, Jane happy...
Tarzan happy.
Tarzan, stop it.
Hey, look what I found.
Shiny stones. Real heavy ones, too.
Just right for my sling.
Boy, let me see those stones a moment.
- Where'd you find them?
- At the bottom of the pool.
They're gold.
- Gold nuggets.
- Gold?
Nuggets?
Yes. Lumps of a very precious metal.
More nuggets up mountain. Big nuggets.
If people in the outside world heard there was gold here...
they'd come swarming up here like an army of ants.
Why, Mother?
Back in civilization, darling, one can buy anything one wants with gold.
Almost.
Buy? What's "buy"?
Well, supposing I have some fruit and Tarzan's hungry...
Tarzan gives me the gold, and I give him the fruit.
Tarzan hungry. Want dinner.
Cheetah's choking on the gold.
Gold no good. Tarzan get dinner.
And so you see, here when we want food...
Tarzan just goes out and catches it.
Mother, why do people in...
Civilization?
Yes, but why do they have to buy clothes, food, and houses? Why?
Darling, I honestly don't know.
It's a problem they've been trying to settle for hundreds of years... and they haven't settled it yet.
At least they hadn't when I left.
What else do they have in the civilization, Mother?
Lots of things.
There's the radio, for instance.
It's like a box, and you can hear music and voices coming right out of it.
You mean the box can talk?
Not really. But the voices come out of it... and it sounds as though people were right there in the box talking.
Are the eggs done yet, Cheetah?
Not yet?
Tarzan, what lovely grapes.
Tell me some more about civilization, Mother.
Then they have airplanes... houses with wings that fly, and they carry people through the air.
They go faster than anything you've ever seen.
- Faster than Tarzan?
- Much faster. Faster than the wind.
Is civilization very far from here, Mother?
Now, darling, just you forget about civilization.
Our world here is far more lovely and exciting than the outside world...
I promise you.
Now, you run and get the caviar from the refrigerator.
Good, the eggs are ready.
Here, Cheetah, take these and cool them in the brook.
Doesn't this look cool and appetizing?
In the outside world, you'd have to pay quite a lot of gold for this.
For fish eggs?
When the fish eggs happen to be caviar.
Now, Cheetah, you bring the eggs over here, and no monkey business.
Cheetah, stop that.
No monkey business now, Cheetah.
Come on, Cheetah. Now, hurry up.
Cheetah, you've had enough grapes.
Come on, help with the dishes.
Gold's been used for lots of things.
But it's the first time I've seen it used for chasing hyenas.
Jane like Tarzan?
What woman wouldn't like a husband who brings her orchids?
There's a whole valley of orchids just across the river.
I know, but out in civilization they don't grow that way.
You have to be very rich to have them.
You don't realize what a very wealthy man your father is.
Who? Tarzan?
Yes, he has everything any man could want. Everything.
Tarzan have Jane.
You have Jane, all right.
You'll have me in a thousand pieces if you're not careful.
That's for the orchid.
Let's walk over to civilization tonight, Mother...
- before we go to bed.
- You've had a long and busy day.
You'll go home, say your prayers, and go to bed.
Cheetah!
Take these plates to the river and wash them. And don't break them.
Remember, no juggling.
Buli, stop that.
Leave those dishes alone.
Bad Buli. You'll wake Tarzan. Come on.
Cheetah, go home.
Cheetah, you have to go home.
You'll have to go back, Buli.
You can't cross here.
You think you're smart, pretty cute, don't you, the way you followed me?
Well, you can just go back with Buli.
Come on!
Hurry up, Cheetah! Hurry up!
Come on, Cheetah.
Stay there. I'll get you out.
That rhino was mad, all right, wasn't he?
You know where I'm going?
I'm going to civilization.
I'm going to buy an airplane.
I've got gold, see.
What did you say?
You mean friends.
Friends?
Yes, friends. You, me, friends.
Like Cheetah and me.
Friends.
What's your name?
Yes, what do they call you?
What does your mother call you?
My name's Boy.
Boy?
That's right. Boy.
Tumbo. Boy.
Juju!
That come from your village?
Juju!
Why are so many people sick, Tumbo?
She's your mother, Tumbo, isn't she?
Juju.
No, Tumbo, not juju. It's sickness.
Friend.
Tell them I didn't bring the sickness.
I didn't do it.
Well, you're safe now, lad... but what are you doing here in the middle of the African jungle?
I live here, up on the escarpment.
Come on, Tumbo. Friends.
- Friends?
- This is Tumbo, he's my friend.
Nice work, O'Doul.
- What's the matter?
- He's fainted. Get some brandy.
Make it Irish whiskey, please.
Better make a run for it.
It's Tarzan!
Tarzan!
Tarzan? Then there really is a Tarzan.
For years I've been hearing about him from the natives.
The White Ape Man they call him, the King of the Jungle.
- Boy all right?
- I'm fine.
You came just in time, Tarzan.
Where's Mother?
Jane wait.
Is she gonna punish me, Tarzan?
Boy wait. Boy find out.
He's the spitting image of the ancient Irish giant...
Finn McCool.
This is Tarzan. He's my father.
How do you do, Tarzan? My name's Elliott.
Tarzan thank.
We thank you.
You certainly saved our lives just now.
It looked for a while as though we were finished.
You've a fine boy there.
Fine boy, little Tarzan.
My name is O'Doul, Mr. Tarzan,
Dennis O'Doul.
You're a fine figure of a man, Mr. Tarzan.
I'll wager you have some Irish in you.
Now I'm certain of it.
This is Mr. Medford, Tarzan.
- He's my associate on this expedition.
- How do you do?
- This is Mr. Vandermeer, our guide.
- Glad to know you.
This gentleman you just shook hands with is our cameraman.
Men not need guns now.
He doesn't like guns. They kill his animals.
You needn't worry, Tarzan.
We're not hunters, we're scientists.
We're trying to find an almost forgotten tribe called the Van-usi.
They're a people that wandered down from Asia into Africa ages ago.
Ever hear of them?
Van-usi? Live up Fyn Mano River.
That's just where we figured to find them.
We were trying to find a pass across the mountains... when we came across this village.
Safari can't cross mountain.
All ice and snow.
Did you hear that?
I know it will be a hard job...
but I figure we could make it in eight or ten weeks.
Men die.
Tarzan take safari up escarpment.
Reach river six days.
- Six days?
- That'd be a tremendous help.
Men help Boy, Tarzan help men. Come.
I don't know how to thank you.
This is Tumbo. He's my friend.
His mother just died from the sickness.
Mother die?
Look at this house on wheels.
It runs and makes noises like an elephant.
Is there an elephant inside?
Well, not exactly an elephant, but it's 125 horses.
It's an automobile, a truck.
- Truck?
- Horses? Where?
What are horses?
Well, they're like zebras.
They carry all our camp, and pull the truck a mile a minute.
Truck no good.
One Ubardi spear kill all horses.
No kill elephant. Elephant better.
That's not a gun, Tarzan.
O'Doul was just taking your picture.
Something like these, Mr. Tarzan, if you'd like to have a look.
Cheetah like pictures.
Come, let's get loaded up.
Yes, just as soon as I get that tank fixed.
M'Hona!
Get the petrol.
Come on, boys. Get in here.
That's good stuff.
Try a nip of whiskey, Mr. Tarzan.
Whiskey bad.
Mr. Tarzan, you're the last man
I'd have taken for a temperance worker.
I'm afraid there isn't much Irish in you.
Your lad's having the time of his life with that horn, Mr. Tarzan.
Make noise like rhino.
Not so good a noise, I'll wager.
No mechanical contrivance can compete with the voice of a living creature.
O'Doul smart man.
Thank you, Mr. Tarzan.
Another compliment like that... and you'll have a smart corpse on your hands.
There's nothing like nature.
It's the natural creatures, the little birds and the beasties.
It's them that touches the cockles of your heart.
That's the drink.
That's what drink does to you.
I'll never touch another drop of drink as long as I live.
Stop pushing that horn, will you?
When do we come to the escarpment?
Have you any idea?
Pretty soon now. We'll be able to see it as soon as we get through the woods.
It reaches almost to the sky.
I suppose we'll have to leave the trucks behind us.
If we had an airplane, we could fly up there.
Too bad we didn't bring one with us.
I was gonna buy an airplane when we got to civilization.
I was gonna buy an automobile, too.
A big one, bigger than this one.
I was gonna buy everything.
Look, Tumbo, this is gold.
It buys everything in civilization.
- What's that?
- Gold.
Gold?
- Yes, sir, gold. It buys everything.
- Let me have a look at that.
Look at this.
Where did you get this?
In the river where we swim.
I see. Is there any more of it?
There's lots of it on the bottom.
Lots of it.
What do you do with it?
I use it in my sling.
They're heavier than stones.
Mother says in civilization you can buy everything with it.
I could buy an airplane with this, couldn't I?
Yes, I guess you could, son.
Have you told Mr. Elliott and Mr. O'Doul about this?
No, sir, I haven't.
You know, you shouldn't tell anyone.
In civilization, gold loses its value if you talk about it too much.
Let's keep this a secret, just between ourselves.
- Shouldn't I even tell the Professor?
- No.
Then it wouldn't be a secret.
Secrets aren't very healthy on an expedition, Medford.
Why don't we wait and discuss this point at the proper time?
Tell you what, son, you keep this a secret... we'll buy you an airplane for yourself.
- You will?
- We'll buy you two of them.
Then Tumbo can have one, too, can't he?
It's a secret. I won't tell anyone ever.
Go ahead, blow the horn if you feel like it.
Look, Tumbo, there's the escarpment.
That's where I live.
Juju.
There's no juju if Tarzan wants you there.
That's where you're gonna live, Tumbo, up there with Tarzan, Jane, and me.
Come on.
Thank you, Tarzan.
My head was spinning there for a moment.
- Escarpment high up.
- Yes, it must be the altitude.
Boy.
Darling, where have you been?
Where did you go?
I've been so worried about you.
You gonna punish me, Mother?
No, darling, not now.
But you must never go away again.
- What happened to you?
- Nothing much.
Here's Tumbo. He's my best friend.
Can't talk very well yet, though.
Happy to know you, Tumbo.
- Friends.
- Friend?
I met him just when the rhino was going to kill him.
What rhino?
Just before we came in the plague.
The plague?
Tarzan, what happened?
Who are these people?
People?
How do you do?
I'm doing better, ma'am, thanks to your charming presence.
O'Doul good little man, like Cheetah.
Now don't be comparing me with him.
If this hairy heathen resembles anybody... it's me wife's second brother
Marcus V. O'Connell.
That's the last bottle of Irish whiskey between here and Dublin.
What are these horrible things that Boy's been telling me?
Boy have good time. Little Tarzan.
- My name is Medford. Glad to know you.
- How do you do?
Tarzan's just been telling me how kind and brave you've been.
We'll never be able to repay you, so welcome to our home.
We should have been at a loss without Tarzan.
Now I am up here, I can understand why
I never could find it indicated on any map.
We like to think of it as being above and beyond maps.
Sort of a world of our own.
I'm so curious,
I must risk being impertinent.
How does such a lovely person with your obvious background and position... come to be here?
A compliment is never impertinent,
Mr. Medford.
I came here. Tarzan and I met.
I fell in love with my future husband.
So naturally I stayed.
You must be very happy here.
We are.
Why, this is Utopia.
Look at the wealth of this country, Professor.
Just standing here you can see rubber, palm oil, gum, copra.
- We have caviar, too.
- Caviar?
Yes. Mother says that's what you call fish eggs in your country.
I suppose this area's very rich in mineral deposits?
I don't really know, Mr. Medford.
It's possible, I suppose.
My husband's a mind reader.
What did he say?
He says he's sure you're very hungry because he is.
- We are hungry, too.
- Shall we go to the house?
Now then, all of you, look this way, please.
This is going to be a masterpiece.
It'll be out of the fixing bath in no time at all now.
Boy is having the time of his life.
Just think, he's never seen a photograph before.
There isn't any need for that sort of thing in this beautiful, private world you have.
I feel almost like an intruder.
But you're not.
You're a most welcome guest.
We hope you'll stay with us a long time.
There's nothing I'd like better than to spend the rest of my days here... but I'm afraid we have to push on.
We've a job ahead of us.
After you've been here a little while... you'll find those jobs aren't as important as you thought they were.
Look, everybody's lost their heads.
They're lost all right.
And you can thank this long-haired scamp here.
What's the matter, Cheetah?
You look awfully funny.
Hey, Boy.
- You want to look through the telescope?
- Yes, sir.
Here.
Here, go ahead.
Do you see the moon?
But I can't see the man in the moon now.
Where's he gone to?
There's no man in the moon.
That's an illusion.
The face you see is made up of shadows... caused by mountains and craters on the moon.
I used to like him. He looked so friendly.
Well, you have got new friends now.
Say, by the way... when are you going to show us the place where you found the gold?
You mean our secret?
Tomorrow morning. Before anybody's up.
Good. Fine.
I'm so happy Boy's getting a chance to see something of the wonders of science.
I can never thank you enough.
That's nothing. We're glad to do it.
Professor Elliott has another surprise for you.
Movies.
Movies? What's that?
Wait till you see.
O'Doul has the projection machine set up now.
Come on, Boy. You too, Tumbo.
Looks like we'll be getting up early in the morning.
All ready to start now in a minute, folks.
Sit down there and make yourselves comfortable.
Isn't it exciting?
There is speed for you, Tarzan.
That train goes at least 100 miles an hour.
Why?
- It gets you there faster.
- Why?
Well, to save time, of course.
What do with time?
I'm afraid he has you there, Vandermeer.
Look, Boy. Airplane.
Look, Tumbo, airplane.
That's what Mr. Medford's going to get us when we get the gold.
Is that all?
Now, it's way past your bedtime, Boy.
You better go to bed.
- But I'm not a bit sleepy.
- Boy, go.
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, darling.
Good night, Tarzan. Come on, Tumbo.
- Good night, Boy.
- Good night, everybody.
Boy said something about you and gold and an airplane.
Yes, Medford. What was all that about?
Nothing much.
Just that the other day Boy told me he'd discovered gold on the escarpment.
Gold up here?
Naturally, I told him what a great piece of luck it would be... and I told him about the things he could buy with gold.
Like the airplanes.
But that's such nonsense.
Little boys tell the most fantastic tales.
That's that.
I'm afraid Boy's going to be disappointed about the plane.
But, Medford, why didn't you mention this gold business before?
It was a bit hard to believe, Professor.
I wanted to wait around and dig and see if I could find the gold.
- No.
- This is any man's country up here.
- Nobody owns this part of the world.
- Tarzan's country.
This is not any man's country.
This is our home.
And we'd be very poor guests indeed... if we repaid your hospitality by doing anything to displease Tarzan or yourself.
- I know you'll agree with me on that point.
- Of course.
Jane, come.
Coming.
Good night. Sleep easily.
We leave tomorrow morning... and you and your family will have your home to yourselves again.
- Jane, come.
- Coming, darling. Thank you, Professor.
Good night.
I'm afraid the O'Douls are born to be poor to the end of their days.
This is a scientific expedition, and
I'll not permit it to turn into a gold hunt.
- Are you afraid of that savage?
- It isn't that... but I don't believe we'd have much chance against him in the jungle.
It's simply that we've been given to understand... that there is no gold to be had here and I believe it.
I want to believe it. I like Tarzan.
He's created a beautiful home in this paradise here... and I wouldn't want to see it overrun and destroyed.
I hope you gentlemen will feel the same way. Good night.
Good night, Professor.
- Thanks.
- Come on.
A little touch of vertigo that hit me.
I thought for a moment there
I'd been drinking.
- You better go to bed now.
- Yes.
You better go to bed and stay there.
- Boy.
- Tarzan, don't wake him now.
Get two airplanes, give one to Tumbo.
I hope all the excitement hasn't upset him.
We better let him sleep. You can talk to him in the morning. Come on.
You mustn't be angry with him, dear.
He realizes so little yet.
Boy good. People bad.
And we mustn't blame them for wanting gold.
In the outside world, gold means as much to them... as the strength in your arms means to you.
People... fools.
Not all of them.
But none of them have what we have.
Tarzan have Jane.
They'll be gone tomorrow, and we'll be alone again.
Wonderfully alone as we've always been.
Has it seemed a long time, Tarzan?
Sun make one safari for Jane and Tarzan.
A poet couldn't have said that more beautifully.
Come.
My, the water's beautiful tonight.
Not water. Jane.
As nice little Mr. O'Doul would say,
"'Tis blarney you're giving me."
Blarney?
Well, we call it love, darling.
Do you remember when we first used to swim here?
Tarzan remember.
To think that I was ever frightened of you.
You know, Tarzan, when a man meets a young lady in the outside world...
he doesn't dare behave not one bit like you did.
What man do?
Well, they shake hands.
That is, if she offers him her hand.
Then he bows from the hips, and asks permission to call.
And then if she's of age... he takes her to some parties or theater or somewhere to dine.
And then if he decides he wants her for his wife... he goes to see her father.
Why? What do with father?
To ask his permission to marry his daughter.
Why?
That's the way it's done. Politely.
With etiquette.
Too much talk. Tarzan way better.
Yes. It is better.
Remember? Tarzan, big hand...
Jane, little hand?
- The last one, Mr. Medford.
- You sure?
Yes, sir. I hunted all over the bottom.
There's no more.
- It's not much, is it?
- Is it enough to buy an airplane?
There must be more.
Tarzan knows where there's a whole mountain of it.
He knows where it is?
- That's what he said.
- I knew there must be more of it.
This isn't river gold.
It came from a vein of almost solid metal.
We've been waiting breakfast for you.
What have you been doing?
We were sure you were wrong about there not being any gold here.
Look at these. Boy brought them up from the bed of the river.
Men say they go last night.
Now, let's be friends and talk this over.
Boy told us you know where there's a mountain full of gold.
- Go!
- Please, madam, let's be sensible.
We'll handle the entire operations... and there will be great wealth for all of us.
You can be the richest woman in the world.
I've no wish to be.
I told you last night, this is our home.
We don't want it disturbed.
I was hoping you'd understand.
Suppose we don't choose to recognize that you and he have any right...
Tarzan say go.
Now, wait a minute...
Jane, Boy, home.
Men go.
That man is a madman, Professor.
- There is gold here. Just as the boy said.
- I see.
There's every indication it's a very rich vein.
Safari go.
I'm sorry, Tarzan, I didn't know this or it wouldn't have happened.
We'd be ready to start now if O'Doul hadn't suddenly been taken ill.
He's very sick at the moment.
We'll leave immediately he's well.
- Little man sick?
- Touch of fever.
- Where?
- There.
Ubardi plague. Tarzan cure.
Is Mr. Tarzan gone?
Yes, but he'll be back soon,
I'm pretty sure.
Then I want to tell you something about him.
- I was back in old Dublin just now.
- Take it easy.
I was departing here, Professor.
I'm certain I was.
And then Mr. Tarzan walked in...
I stopped, I couldn't go on.
He put his hand on me head...
and it yanked me back to life as sudden as a rope around me body.
It's hard to die... when Mr. Tarzan is around.
Would you kindly give me a sip of cool water?
That's where I was, back in old Dublin.
Medicine cure.
- Better soon.
- Thank you.
It's a fine Christian you are, Mr. Tarzan.
He's terribly sick, Tarzan.
He collapsed on his way back from the river.
Ubardi plague.
Tarzan get medicine. Tarzan cure.
I'm afraid, I'm terribly afraid.
Tarzan cure.
We should never have allowed him out in the jungle by himself.
It's all my fault.
He's dying.
Tarzan get medicine.
Boy better soon.
Your fever's broken, Dennis.
Now you won't need any more medicine for a while.
I'm glad you've come, gentlemen.
O'Doul is getting better.
Tarzan's medicine did the trick.
What's the matter with you, Professor?
You don't look so good to me.
I'm all right.
Just a little rocky at the moment.
We'll break camp first thing tomorrow morning.
O'Doul will be able to travel then.
We've no intention of leaving the escarpment, Professor.
Not for a while, anyway.
You're still members of this expedition... and I'm still in charge.
We are not interested in your expedition anymore.
I see.
So that's what the guns are all about.
And you're the gentlemen who look upon
Tarzan as some sort of barbarian.
I'm sure of one thing.
I'm sure he'll know how to deal with you.
Allow me.
I'm sorry.
Perhaps this is a piece of luck.
Anyway, it's worth trying. Come on.
Mr. Elliott is down with fever himself.
I've had a little medical experience.
I thought I might be able to help.
Boy is so sick, I don't know what to do.
Yes, he's a very sick boy.
- What have you done for him?
- Tarzan gave him his medicine.
It's hard to tell about these so-called natural remedies.
- O'Doul is worse.
- You mean the medicine didn't help him?
No, madam, he's much worse now.
Tarzan say go.
But, Tarzan, they came here to help us.
Medicine cure. Boy better soon.
If I could be just sure.
We have some medicine that might help.
Sulfamyradol.
It's a new drug that works wonders in cases such as this.
- Elliott's already sent a runner for some.
- Where?
We foolishly enough left it in the truck at the foot of the escarpment.
- The runner will be back in a day or two.
- A day or two... may be too late.
Tarzan will go.
He travels swiftly.
He'd be back by morning.
- That's a good idea.
- Yes, it is a good idea.
- No.
- But, Tarzan, you have to go.
Tarzan's medicine cure.
Tarzan, we can't leave anything undone.
Oh, darling,
I have great faith in you always.
But if anything happened to Boy, we'd never forgive ourselves.
Darling, if you love me... if you love Boy, you've got to go.
Tarzan go.
The native guards at the truck will give it to you.
It's in a special medical kit in a white tin box.
Hurry, Tarzan.
Tarzan get kit.
All right, O'Doul.
If you're finished there, you better get moving. We're leaving tonight.
Tonight? But we can't leave the sick lad here.
He's all right. His fever's broken.
We're going over to see him now.
Be sure M'Hona has the boys ready to leave when Vandermeer gets back.
- Are you not coming with us?
- No, I'm staying... to wait for Tarzan.
Never mind any more questions, O'Doul.
I'm in charge now. Get going.
They're all right. They're fine.
You were right about that medicine.
It cured the little fellow, just like that. Marvelous medicine.
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about, Tarzan.
It won't do any good to kill me.
You'd better quiet down or you'll never see your family again.
Where Elliott?
He's gone. The fever got him.
Tarzan understand.
But your family is all right.
They're over with Vandermeer.
Now, listen, Tarzan... here's the idea, if only you'll let me explain it.
If you show me where that gold comes from...
you can have your family back safe and sound.
The sooner you show me the gold, the sooner you'll have them back.
How Tarzan know?
Gold's all we want.
That shouldn't be difficult to understand.
Go!
Where Jane? Where Boy?
You know the little lake near the cut at the end of the chasm?
- Tarzan know.
- They're over there with Vandermeer.
There's no sign of him.
I think I've finished him.
Tarzan juju man, bwana.
He'll need plenty of juju if he's broken his neck... or if one of those slugs caught up with him.
Hey, Vandermeer.
You are a wealthy man, my friend.
- Did he show it to you?
- It's enormous.
A second Johannesburg.
Mr. Medford, where is Tarzan?
Your husband's behaving rationally for a change.
He's meeting us by the trucks at the base of the escarpment.
- I don't believe you.
- Why not?
Tarzan understands quite clearly... that the only way I can be sure of his allowing us to leave safely... is by keeping you with us until we do.
You see, I respect your husband.
And I'm making certain that he respects me.
Tarzan would never agree to that.
You're keeping something back.
I'm going to him.
Perhaps I better guard these heathens.
There's no need for that, O'Doul.
I never thought that you, too, would...
Tarzan will twist your head off for this and feed it to hyenas.
What savage sentiment.
This is the only way we can deal with a man... who swings through the trees without trousers...
and tries to block the progress of civilization.
Now, as your partner...
We're not interested in your opinions.
Tell the boys to get packed.
We leave at once.
Certainly, gentlemen.
What really happened to Tarzan?
- I had to dispose of him.
- I didn't count on murder, Medford.
It was he or I. The beast attacked me.
But if he is dead, what do you want her and the boy for?
There's just a chance I didn't finish him.
Fell in a ravine, out of sight.
We better hold them, just in case.
In any event, we've got to get out of here, fast.
Get organized, come back with machinery and equipment.
What's a short route out of here?
This is new country to me.
We'll have to go back the way we came.
It'll take us eight weeks to get back to Nairobi.
Ask him if he knows a quicker way.
There is a shortcut along the river.
But then we have to cross the country of the Jaconi.
- We'll take it.
- Now, wait a moment.
Jaconi are the most dangerous tribe in Africa.
We would be much better off...
He says the porters won't go that way.
They are afraid of the Jaconi.
- He says they are water devils.
- Never mind what he says.
Tell them to get going.
We'll pay €5 bonuses.
Hop to it. Let's be off.
I'm going, Mother. I'm going to get Tarzan.
- No, Boy. You mustn't.
- I must. Don't worry, please.
I want no help from you, Mr. O'Doul.
Well spoken, ma'am.
If your spirits are up, you'll never be down.
This isn't the way back to your trucks.
It's our way.
Where are you taking us?
Where's Tarzan?
What did you do to Tarzan?
If you don't keep quiet,
I'll have you bound and carried.
Boy, no.
Jaconis. War drums.
M'Hona, tell those boys to keep up.
They refuse to go any farther.
This way, we can keep an eye on them.
This is no good. We better get back.
You're a little too late.
We are surrounded by now.
Why don't we make a stab for it and fight them off?
Our only chance is to make the river.
He's right.
The Jaconis want to capture us alive.
They kill white people very slowly.
Look. Mr. O'Doul.
He's probably better off. Come. M'Hona!
Yeah, come on.
Make a run for it, sonny. I can't move.
The angels and the saints preserve me...
and the pickaninny here, keep an eye on him, too.
All right, you big bully.
I'll take no more of your insults and intimidations.
All right, now, enough is enough.
Come out here, you coward.
Come out here, and I'll give you the thrashing of your miserable life.
That arrow couldn't have come from more than 10 feet away.
- Stop wasting your bullets.
- I thought I saw something moving.
Get a hold of yourself.
Stop.
Tell them anybody who tries it again gets the same.
I can't stand any more.
Why don't they take me and get it over with?
No such luck. They're saving us.
They'll take us down the river tomorrow to the village.
What do those drums say?
I don't know, but I can assure you it is not to our benefit.
That's a bad spot for Mr. Tarzan to be in.
What did you say, Mr. Tarzan?
Get vine. Tarzan catch.
Grab a hold of that and pull it back.
That's something like it, me bucko.
Pull! Pull it, Timba.
Come on, Samson, we'll give this thing another try.
Suffering snakes! He made it.
Better hurry up, Mr. Tarzan.
Them scoundrels have got hold of Mrs. Tarzan and the youngster.
They're heading for the Jaconi country.
I'm coming, Mr. Tarzan.
I'm on the way.
You may be a monster to the local inhabitants... but you're just another lizard to O'Doul.
Timba will take you over the mountains.
From there on, the way is easy.
What on earth might this be?
It is a large and ponderous fruit, so it is.
It's a bon voyage basket.
- Jungle-style.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Here's something to keep the sun off your head.
Thank you, son.
We're going to miss you.
Tarzan find friend.
It's me that's found a friend, and the best.
If there were more folks like you in the world... it would be a sweet and a smiling place.
I'll never forget you.
Goodbye, heaven bless you.
- Goodbye, Mr. O'Doul.
- Goodbye, good luck always.
Wouldn't you like to see Mr. O'Doul 's face when he finds the melon's full of gold?
O'Doul laugh, then cry.
He'll be rich, won't he?
And he'll never tell where his riches came from.
You can be sure of that.
Tarzan sure.
Friend.
Oh, Dr. Lazar.
Good morning, good morning.
- Good afternoon, commissioner.
- What?
Yes, it is. Good afternoon, good afternoon.
I've just been glancing through your health and sanitation reports for July.
- Oh, and are they as dull as that?
- Not at all, not at all.
Facts are never dull, except this wretched gout of mine.
Didn't the medicine I gave you ease the pain?
Certainly. And it also counteracts the effect of good whiskey.
- And it is good whiskey.
- Yes.
Well, how was your trip through the jungle this time, Lazar?
Oh, routine. I gave the natives plenty of quinine and a hint or two on sanitation.
You've certainly solved the problem of dealing with the natives.
That's one advantage of being partially native myself. Please.
Of course. A spot of soda.
You know, the territory of Bugandi is coming under our jurisdiction.
- I've been sending up men and supplies.
- Yes, so I've noticed.
Well, Bugandi will be in need of good doctors.
Would you be willing to accept an appointment there?
It would mean a promotion.
Well, I am deeply indebted to the government, of course.
If it were not for them, I might still be an ignorant, superstitious savage...
...running around in a loincloth.
But I have my hands full in this territory.
I don't like to leave a job half-finished.
- I'll convince you yet, Lazar.
- We shall see.
I'm being transferred up there myself.
I don't mind in the least.
Between you and me, this place is becoming infernally dull. Cheerio.
Tarzan must be in town.
- Oh, he's in town, all right.
- Yes.
Your strength is that of 10, my friend.
Again you have defeated
Tongolo the Terrible.
- Better luck next time.
- Always you say that, my friend.
And always when you come each year to Zambesi, it is the same.
With Tarzan, Tongolo is not so terrible.
Tarzan, we came to Zambesi to buy some gifts...
...not to wrestle, remember?
- Tarzan not forget.
Last time we shop, I carry everything.
- Do I have to go along?
- No, Boy.
I have lots of relatives in England and they all want gifts from Africa.
Cheeta and I'll look around, then.
- Yes, lady?
- Oh, the last time I was here...
...you had some little, white, carved ivory elephants.
- Oh, yes, the ones inlaid with gold.
- That's right. Would you show me some?
It is unfortunate madam wasn't here two days ago.
Then, I had no less than 50 of the carved elephants, but...
Surely you haven't sold them all in two days.
Oh, no. I sent them all by caravan to Bugandi.
They shall fetch high prices in the bazaars there now.
Oh, dear, and Aunt Agnes asked me especially for something in ivory.
Tarzan send Aunt Agnes big lion tooth.
Oh, that would frighten her to death.
We'd better look for something else.
At your service, lady.
Haven't you more of that flower design
I got here the last time?
Alas, lady, if only you were here two days ago.
Then, I had no less than 30 rolls of the silk you describe, but...
But you loaded it all in a caravan and shipped it off to Bugandi.
A miracle. The lady reads my mind.
- Next week we have plenty more.
- Jane better shop in the jungle next time.
Guess I'll have to.
Always they screech like that when
I perform. They are ruining my business.
They are taking the bread from the mouth of my snake.
If you don't mind, let's stop at the school for a moment.
- Why, Jane.
- Hello, Miss Wetherby.
Oh, how nice to see you.
Tarzan and Boy.
Good gracious, how you've grown.
Yes, he's almost keeping pace with your young ladies.
Do you know, Jane, that they've been chosen to go as teachers to Bugandi?
- To Bugandi?
- Yes.
The government is setting up a school system there.
So under the new arrangement...
...Bugandi will have the opportunities we've given the natives here.
That's wonderful, isn't it, Tarzan?
Children in Bugandi learn quick with pretty teachers.
They'll get lots of apples.
- And when does this all take place?
- They leave on the next caravan.
Oh, well, congratulations, girls.
Tarzan and I both wish you luck.
- Thank you.
- Pretty girls always have luck.
Cheeta.
Put that flute away.
For your school.
There must be things you need.
Oh, no, Jane, you've been so good to us already.
Oh, very well.
- Easy. Easy, now.
- Try to tell us what happened.
Our caravan attacked.
Elephants stampeded.
All killed. Only I...
The caravan to Bugandi attacked.
How? Where?
Leopards. Leopards...
- He's dead.
- Poor fellow.
How appalling. A whole caravan wiped out by leopards.
I wonder if the other caravans got through safely.
But what about these girls, commissioner?
They can't go to Bugandi if it isn't safe.
Of course not.
We'll organize a hunt at once.
- Leopards not kill man.
- What's that?
- Man not killed by leopards.
- The man said so himself.
- He was killed by them.
- Leopards never kill with claws alone.
Use teeth.
Well, if... If not leopards, what then?
Don't know. Maybe man think leopards.
Well, whatever it is,
I intend to hunt them down.
- Sergeant, assemble your men.
- Tarzan go too.
Oh, Tarzan, haven't you had enough hunting during your life?
- I think we better go home.
- No, let's go with them.
We go with safari. Maybe we find out what did attack caravan.
That's right, Tarzan.
You come along with us.
Cheeta! Cheeta! Cheeta, where are you?
- Are you coming along with us, doctor?
- I should enjoy going with you.
But my work holds me here.
No, it's your turn for adventure, commissioner.
- Good hunting.
- Thank you.
- See anything yet?
- No, not yet.
If it wasn't leopards, then what could it be?
Maybe something like leopard that isn't leopard.
Something like leopard that isn't leopard?
That's something I've never heard of.
You sure you haven't got a touch of the sun, Tarzan?
Tarzan is clever.
His experience in the jungle has taught him to suspect.
- It is the hunter who will be hunted.
- No, Ameer.
We must be cautious because of Tarzan.
So the commissioner has come to hunt leopards.
Tarzan, too, will find leopards.
No enemy is more harmless than he who has been killed by ridicule.
Well, Tarzan, what do you say now?
- Something wrong.
- Really?
Sorry, Jane. Little...
Come along, men.
By the way, if you should see any of those leopards that aren't leopards...
...be sure to let me know.
- Maybe Tarzan will.
Cheeta!
Cheeta! Come on.
Ameer?
- All went well?
- All went well.
The commissioner returns to Zambesi...
...satisfied that he has cleared the trail of killer leopards.
And Tarzan returns home, ridicule still ringing in his ears.
Then you should be happy, but you seem weary.
I am weary, weary of the greed and pretense of civilization.
This servile government official, who calls himself a commissioner...
...has reduced the people of Zambesi to a race of sniveling shopkeepers...
...fit only to carve toy images of elephants and other such baubles.
The Zambesis are clever with their hands, not their heads.
- But our people...
- Will suffer the same fate.
Bugandi, our rightful territory, will soon be overrun.
Already, this commissioner, bursting with self-importance...
...has had the audacity to offer me a position there.
Naturally, it would mean a promotion.
You torture yourself for my people, Ameer.
They are my people too.
There is so much to be done.
I've studied the ways of civilization in their universities.
I know the decadence of their puerile teachings.
Yet always I've been restless...
...until the love for my own people drew me back to them.
My people are fortunate to be given the fruits of your wisdom and experience.
Yet they grow careless.
They permitted one man to escape and bring news to Zambesi.
True, Ameer. But those that were guilty of this carelessness have been punished.
Yet one more such error...
- What are you doing here, Kimba?
- Nothing, only I listened.
Your ears grow too big for your head.
Careful they are not cut off.
Not even you, Ameer, would harm the brother of Lea, the high priestess.
- Do not be too sure of that.
- Please, Ameer. Kimba, leave us.
I leave, all right.
Let Tarzan make trouble. I do not care.
What is this about Tarzan?
Because I have big ears, because I always listen...
...I know Tarzan was not fooled by leopards.
You say this to annoy me.
Even after Tarzan see leopards, he still not fooled.
I hear him say he find out.
Maybe I go watch Tarzan.
No, Kimba. I do not wish it so.
We will have no further trouble with Tarzan.
I return now to Zambesi to congratulate the commissioner on his successful hunt.
- He hates me.
- No, Kimba, that isn't true.
Why didn't he send me to watch?
We've avoided Tarzan ever since we've been here.
But if I go, my eyes can see all the jungle man does.
- My ears can hear all he say.
- You're not old enough.
But it's time for me to prove to be warrior.
- You say he was not fooled?
- No, I'm sure.
- You go only to watch?
- Yes, Lea. I'll only go watch.
- You will be careful.
- I'll only go watch Tarzan...
...and lady with golden hair.
Little boys should not spy on warrior.
You, a warrior?
If you are, show us the heart of one you have killed.
When I come back,
I will show you a heart.
Why don't you stop this racket, Cheeta.
You'll never be a musician.
All right, then. Go on and try and be a snake charmer.
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Tarzan!
- What is it, Boy?
- It's busted again.
Not the shower bath.
If I've asked Tarzan once,
I've asked him a hundred times.
Bet you Tarzan's gonna catch it now.
Oh, Tarzan, I've practically begged you to fix that shower...
...and here you just sit.
- Tarzan thinking.
I thought so. Really, Tarzan...
...you've let the whole place go to rack and ruin, just because...
Now what is it?
You're not so clever, Cheeta.
Look at that bird.
He's 20 times smaller than you are, and he has 10 times your brain.
Here, give me the flute.
Bird do everything just like Boy.
Why, yes, dear, but what's so strange about that?
If animal can act like man, maybe man can act like animal.
What on earth are you talking about?
Maybe caravan people killed by men.
Men who kill like leopards.
This is too fantastic.
I'm beginning to believe the commissioner was right...
...in saying you had a touch of the sun.
You saw the leopards with your own eyes.
Jane.
Tarzan!
Well, there's your man like leopard:
My parlor rug.
Now what do you say?
Tarzan say, better fix shower.
- Will it take long to fix it, Tarzan?
- Not long.
- Tarzan get bamboo right now.
- I'll go with you.
Help!
Help!
Oh, save me, save me!
Kimba run from lion.
- Where boy come from?
- Jungle.
- What part of jungle?
- Far away.
- Well, are you alone?
- Alone.
Oh, don't be afraid. It's only Cheeta.
What tribe you belong to?
Don't question any further, Tarzan.
Can't you see he's frightened?
And he's probably hungry.
Very hungry.
How long since you've eaten?
Two, three day, maybe.
Kimba forget.
Well, here, let's take him to the house.
You don't look weak.
I mean, after all that time in the jungle.
Kimba weak like other boys, he die in jungle.
But we can't just turn him out like a wild animal.
All right.
Kimba stay for a little while.
Kimba, we'd like for you to stay with us until you feel strong enough to go home.
Kimba thanks kind lady with golden hair.
These men have proven their worthiness.
By no word or sign will they betray our secrets.
Deep in the jungle, they have lived as the leopard lives.
They have endured hardships and hunger.
They have fought as wild beasts.
They have proven themselves warriors by bringing back a heart...
...which they offered to the leopard god as a symbol of their worthiness.
I welcome you who have come to join our crusade.
Behold the leopard god.
Swear before him to obey all those to whom he confides his sacred will.
We swear.
These skins are your disguise.
These claws are your weapons.
That's right, Kimba.
You're getting along beautifully.
Jane!
Oh, Jane! We're going to get bamboo to fix the shower now.
- I can hardly believe it.
- This time Tarzan fix sure.
Why don't you go with them?
Tarzan and Boy do not like Kimba.
Oh, you mustn't think that, of course they like you.
See, they're used to doing everything together.
Why, they often leave me alone for days.
Then Kimba must stay.
Nonsense. You run along.
Kimba promised to help Jane.
Kimba keep promise.
You certainly are a boy after my own heart.
I don't know how I ever got along without you.
What?
Even Cheeta's beginning to see things in the jungle that aren't there.
Wonder who could've taken my knife.
It couldn't have been
Boy playing leopard again.
I wonder if one of those terrible leopards is around here again.
Jane!
We brought enough bamboo to build a whole new shower.
- What wrong, Jane?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
I wonder if...
Kimba! Kimba, are you there?
What's happened, Jane? You look so...
Somebody call Kimba?
- Kimba, I thought you were in the house.
- Kimba was looking for you.
Wanted to give you something.
I thought maybe...
Did you see anything of a...?
- Well, it looked like...
- Jane.
What is it?
Nothing really.
Thank you, Kimba.
You'd better get busy, Tarzan.
All right.
What happened?
For a minute, I thought Tarzan might be right about...
About...
Oh, no, it couldn't be.
It just couldn't be.
Need more vine.
I noticed some lying behind the well.
- Kimba...
- Kimba fetch for Jane.
- Tarzan, I must talk to you.
- What?
It has to do with the idea you had about...
...people who imitate animals.
Jane make bad joke.
Tarzan forget all about that.
Tarzan, I'm not joking.
Here.
That seems very little.
I'm sure Kimba can find some more.
This enough.
Your orders are to accompany the caravan to Bugandi, then await my arrival.
- Is that clear?
- Quite clear, sir.
Remember, girls, when you get to Bugandi...
...you'll each have your own responsibilities.
- We're sorry to be leaving you.
- You've been wonderful.
- Here we are, off on the big trip, eh?
- We thank you, sir, for this opportunity.
We'll try to make you and Miss Wetherby proud of us.
Splendid, splendid.
It's the government who thanks you.
And now, as the French say, bon voyage.
- Goodbye, Miss Wetherby.
- Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, girls.
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Good luck.
- Are you absolutely sure...?
- That the caravan is safe?
Perfectly. As safe as Zambesi itself.
I wouldn't think of sending the girls out if I had the slightest doubt.
God bless you, girls.
You should be proud that your young ladies...
...have the privilege of pioneering a new frontier.
I am proud, but I'll never be really happy until I know my girls have arrived safely.
They will.
Has Kimba returned yet?
Not yet, my priestess.
Send warriors and have him brought back at once.
For many days, we have been draining the manpower of our enemies...
...by our raids on their caravans.
Yet such is their greed...
...that still they send out caravans loaded with goods and treasures.
Be not deceived. Every diabolical element on earth is at work in Zambesi.
And now they hope to bring Bugandi under the control of their civilization...
...that detests our way of life.
They will stop at nothing to destroy us.
They are ready to kill us for our beliefs.
No! No! No!
We must finally put a stop to these people from Zambesi.
We must never rest.
Or soon, all our territory will be invaded.
Why have they come to our land?
So that they can exploit the rich resources of our jungle...
...and steal from us the treasure that is rightfully ours.
Away with them!
Down with them!
Away with them! Down with them!
If our leopard god grant that
I live to fulfill his purpose...
...I shall lead you to the utter destruction of their false protestations...
...of liberty, of freedom, of sniveling piety.
Yeah!
Already on the trail, four maidens have set out from Zambesi...
...sent by our enemies to corrupt the minds of the people of Bugandi.
To arouse our own blood brothers to take up arms against us.
- Shall we permit this to happen?
- No!
Go now to attack the caravan.
Though not as men, but as leopards.
Go silently, stealthily.
Destroy every human being.
Yet see that the four maidens are brought here to the temple alive.
Then I shall disclose to you what our leopard god decrees for the future.
Mongo, lead the warriors and may the leopard god's will be fulfilled.
It's all right, Cheeta, you can come out now.
Cheeta?
What have you got there?
Give it to me.
Wait till Tarzan sees this.
Kimba.
Kimba. Wait.
What is it, Cheeta?
Where?
- No, Tarzan. Wait, I...
- No time for talk. Boy in danger.
Kimba?
Tarzan.
There's hundreds of them.
They've captured the girls.
- What girls?
- From Zambesi.
The leopard men have got them at the river. Hurry, Tarzan.
Wait, Tarzan!
Tarzan! Kimba! Kimba and Jane!
Take two men. Follow him.
We will head him off downriver.
Run, girls. Tarzan follow.
Where have you been, Kimba?
I was looking for something.
Kimba, must you play with that knife?
Can't you find something else?
Kimba was looking for something else, but not there anymore.
Put that knife away.
Did you hear me?
I said, put that knife away.
Boy.
Tarzan was right all the time.
Now I take back two hearts.
Boy.
Thanks, Cheeta.
- Boy, are you all right?
- I'm all right.
- Oh, you're hurt.
- It's nothing.
What do we do with him?
- Tie him up, lock him in the storehouse.
- All right.
Keep your eyes on him, Cheeta.
Where is my brother?
Speak! Where is Kimba?
- It is useless. He will not answer.
- I will make him talk.
Lea.
Dr. Lazar.
You were quite right, Tarzan.
Man not killed by leopards.
Now that you have discovered us, you, too, will die.
Not till he tells where Kimba is.
What is this about Kimba?
Forgive me, Ameer. Against your will,
I sent Kimba to watch Tarzan.
Wherever Kimba is, there is trouble.
Even though we destroy Tarzan, his people might...
Mongo, send warriors to the jungle man's house.
Find Kimba. Bring him and Tarzan's people here.
Yes, Ameer.
And we could stop over in India on the way.
I'm sure Tarzan would agree to it.
I want you to meet people and know the way they live.
There's so much to see and learn that's new and exciting.
You would enjoy that, wouldn't you, Boy?
What? Oh, yes.
Jane...
...do you think Tarzan...?
- We could leave as soon...
What's the use, Jane?
Tarzan should be back.
He should've been back long ago.
- Boy, Tarzan wouldn't want us to worry.
- I know, but...
And he certainly wouldn't want us to be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Quick, Jane, into the house.
Tarzan!
First thing I do when we reach
Bugandi is to get hold of Dr. Lazar.
Capable fellow, Lazar, but careless at times.
No business to go off into the jungle before he saw I had plenty of medicine.
- No, sir.
- My God, this foot hurts.
Yes, sir.
Must get Lazar to accept that appointment.
Yes, sir.
Nothing like a good pipe, is there, corporal?
- No, sir.
- Especially after a job well done, huh?
Yes, sir.
I think I can safely say that the caravan trail to Bugandi...
...will not be troubled with killer leopards for some time to come.
Yes, sir.
Oh, do not be afraid.
I will not let others harm you.
- Leave.
- No.
You are not my leader. My sister is.
You've done nothing but cause trouble.
Go. Do not try my patience.
Did not I, your leader, promise you a greater glory if you brought...
...the Zambesi maidens to the temple?
- Yeah!
That greater glory is now at hand.
No longer shall we be content raiding the caravans of our enemies.
Now our leopard god has decreed that I lead you to Zambesi itself.
To Zambesi!
We shall fall upon our enemies and then slay them.
Our crusade will be fulfilled.
Yet, remember.
Though our enemies are stupid, they are many and we are few.
Let us humbly beseech our leopard god to endow us with his own courage...
...his own strength, his own cunning.
Let us seek his favor with a sacrifice.
But not a sacrifice of the hearts of dead men.
This time let us offer him living hearts.
The hearts of the Zambesi maidens!
And the man that interfered.
His fate, too, shall be death.
But before he dies, he shall see his woman and his boy slain.
Cheeta.
Get others free.
You did this, you...
What was that?
Oh, no rest for the weary.
I suppose I'd better investigate.
Kimba want heart. Kimba get heart.
Lazar's heart. Kimba dead too.
What's all the excitement?
- Big fight with the leopard men.
- Lazar tried to kill us.
- They kidnapped us.
- It was awful.
- You have no idea.
- There are leopard people. Tarzan's right.
Lazar and the dead leopard boy are in the cave.
Leopard boy? Leopard people?
Lazar a killer?
Is everybody mad?
Am I the only sane person around here?
Look. Look out!
What's all this monkey business?

I see a long, straight line athwart a continent
No chain of forts
or deep-flowing river or mountain range
but a line drawn by men upon a map
nearly a century ago
accepted with a handshake
and kept ever since
a boundary
which divides two nations
yet marks
their friendly meeting ground
The 49th parallel—
the only undefended frontier in the world
Gun crew!
Get to those stations!
Fine work, Hirth.

What in the devil's name are you doing?
Where's your camera?
You there! Come alongside!
Hang on, boy.
Man the gun.
Yes, we'll make it.
Come on, all together.
Stop!
Take it now
Where's your captain?
The old man's dead.
He went down to the cabin to get the ship's papers.
He must've got caught when she rolled.

- Montreal.
Your cargo?
Crude oil.
- How many tons?
- Three thousand.
That's a lie. You were carrying a full cargo —
2,000 tons of crude oil, 5,000 tons of gasoline.
- Is that correct?
- If you say so.
Action stations!

You dirty swine!

Here come the boys!
Give 'em a cheer!
Only a fool would imagine we could raid enemy ships for supplies now.
Outgoing ships will be detained, incoming ships heavily convoyed... at least for the next few days.
We must find a spot where the enemy is least likely to seek us out... which is not being patrolled every day... where they'll never think of looking for us.
Hudson Bay.
Too many damned icebergs about.
- What's our position?
- Three miles off Point Amour.
If we go up, we risk the patrols, but we'll make better time.
If we stay below, we risk the ship.
I'm going up.
Action stations!
Where are we?
The North Pole?
Belle Isle Straits.
There's a lot of ice coming down.
- Fifty degrees.
- Fifty degrees, Herr Leutnant
Ah.
Good.
I can see the opening dead ahead.
Take a look here.
 You're quite sure
this is a suitable in-draft
Yes, Herr Kommandant
Those are the cliffs he mentions in his notes.
Stand by.

According to my log, there should be a sheltered beach at the end of the fjord.
- Will you go in?
- Yes.
Then you can pick a landing party, clean ship
I'll give you 12 hours
Canada.
Leutnant Hirth, you have your orders.
Leutnant Kuhnecke,
you are second in command
You are taking one day's rations
with you—not more
Your mission is to bring back food and fuel.
Over that hill you will find a Hudson's Bay trading post.
If the men there are armed and are foolish enough to offer resistance...
you will destroy them
Jahner!
Take this flag.
As soon as the post is captured, you will hoist it and I shall bring the ship in.
Do not forget, you are the first of the German forces to set foot on Canadian soil —
the first of many thousands
Be worthy of that high honor
Acquit yourselves
like men and Germans
Each of you,
in the fulfillment ofhis duty
is helping to bring about the completion
of our führer's great plan
Today, Europe.
Tomorrow, the whole world!

She is dandy, huh?
- Oh, manor grand!

Sure thing. I stay till the boat come.
And wait till you see my skins.

And now I'm gonna get so busy doing nothing.

Good night.
"Ship time at Rangnirtung"
Say, where the ship?
I've been answering that question till I'm fair sick and tired of it.
Not a soul comes through this post that doesn't ask it, huskies and all.
"Where's the ship, boss?
Where's the ship?"
- Bien, alors, where is ship?
- Behind the hill!
Ah, oui Bien sûr
Come on. Sit down.
Well, what's the news from home, eh?
Some good, some bad.
Everyone is well.
That is good.
Business is slow.
That is bad.
My father say it is because of them war rumors.
But he tell me no worry.
This Hitler is only bluffing.
And he said they all say
there will be no war this year or next year
You look to me as I go mad.
Of course, I was forgetting.
You can't have seen a paper in over a year.
What do you mean?
- Has it happened, then?
- Sure it's happened. Bigger than the last.
Nom de dieu!
- Who fighting?
- Mostly everybody
- Who starting first?
- Oh, the Germans, of course.
They marched in on the Poles in September 1939.
- The Poles?
- Sure.
Ma foi, I thought all the poles was in Canada!
No, no, Johnnie.
They've given Poland a terrible time.
Wiped out Warsaw.
And those poor refugees —You know, the women and children who tried to get away— they machine-gunned them down.
The Germans are ordinary men, same as you and me.
I wouldn't do a thing like that. Would you?
Well, you can't tell me they do.
That's all newspaper talk to try and bring us in.
A wee bit late, Johnnie, my lad.
We are in.
Canada, in the war?
Sure she is.
Didn't you hear the bombing tonight?
Bombing?
Was that bombing?
Sure. One of our planes went across.
Maneuvering, I suppose.
Yi-yi-yi-yi.
So, Canada, she in the war.
Pas possible
Anyhow, you can't tell me
French Canada got mixed in it too.
- I certainly can.
- Nom de dieu!
They're in it
just the same as everybody else
But that beat me!
I don't see what for French Canada had to go to defend a bunch of Poles!
I don't get that at all.
I don't see what that mean to us.
Anyhow, one kind government... much same like 'nother.
Yeah, you're right there.
We're all the same.
Don't get you nowhere.
Anyhow, we needn't worry about it out here.
I guess all we got to do
is just to do our jobs
That suit me.
- What about a wee drink, Johnnie, eh?
- That suit me too.
- Well, here's the skin off your nose.
- And off yours too, you old walrus.
Ay-yi-yi.
I won't sleep well tonight.
Never do first night in real bed.
I was just the same when I was trapping.
Oh, but you get used to it in a couple of nights.
Dogs are noisy tonight.
Seem like your and mine getting to know one 'other.
Aye, the wind is blowing up.
A regular Montreal concert.
- Window! Door!
- Hey, what's the big idea?
- Hello.
- Move out.
- Johnnie!
- Stay where you are.
- Door locked, Herr Leutnant
- No one else here?
- Only this.
- Search him. Kranz and Lohrmann, search the other two.
You've ammunition and rifles here.
Where are they?
They're in the cupboard.
Kranz, your rifle.
Do not smash cupboard.
Cupboard's not locked.
- Where are the rifles?
- Better tell him.
- In the store.
- Which is the store?
Big building outside with the company sign.
Vogel. Kranz.
What sort of crook are you anyhow?
What's the game?
 Have you people in Canada
not heard that there's a war on?
Sure we hear there war on!
You —
- German.
- Yes! German! We are German!
Okay. Why yell about it?
Moi, j'ai compris
You German.
I'm Canadian, he Canadian and he Canadian.
My father fight against you last time. We give you one good licking then, and we do it again.
Johnnie!
Don't any of you guy ever laugh?
The English tell us we've no sense of humor, which means simply that our humor is different from theirs.
Ah. I tell Nick.
He appreciate that.
- Nick?
- My servant, who your man kick when he can't kick back.
The Eskimos are racially as low as Negroes.
- What's the matter with Negroes?
- They're semi-apes, only one degree above theJews.
Who says so?
Those are the führer's own words, from Mein Kampf
Ah, voyons!
I make my living trapping animal.
But if I was meet half-ape, I wouldn't kick him in the stomach as you did that husky in there.
Please don't abuse our kindness. We're trying to be friendly, but you're making it difficult.
Okay, okay, okay.
Do you have to waste my batteries?
- I want you to answer a few questions.
- Let's hear them first.
What transportation have you with the outside world?
Transportation? I'll have to walk to the railway, or else wait for the boat.
- When does the next boat arrive?
- If the weather's good, she'll be here this July.
If the ice closes, it'll be theJuly after that.
- I want the truth.
- You callin' me a liar?
Yes.
You ask me to believe that you've only one ship a year?
Believe it or not, it's all the same to me, my wee man.
- Where's the nearest railway?
- Churchill.
Churchill.
- And the nearest police post?
- Aha! You'll soon find out!
Lake Harbor.
You seem to know all about it, eh?
- What strength is it?
- Uh, 30 men. Or is it 25, Albert?
Or two.
Where you get him?
- How 'bout this for a map?
- It makes ours look a bit out of date
Where'd you get it?
- Did you ever meet a missionary called Malotte?
- Malotte! Sure! You remember him, Albert?
- A flying missionary.
- I mind him.
You remember that time his airplane was lost and all the people pray for his safety?
- He was a good missionary.
- He was one grand fellow.
And an even better mapmaker.
Oh, so that was it.
The spyin' blackguard.
I would never have believed it, a man of his cloth.
Oh, and good.
Good priest like Malotte too.
And a good German.

9- A-U-E calling C-Y-7-B.
Come in, C-Y-7-B.
C- Y-7-B.
That's our call signal.
Who is it?
Oh, just a friend of mine.
An American from Grand Rapids, Michigan.
- He plays chess with me.
- Chess?
- Sure, chess
- Why?
To pass the time!
Ma foi!
He don't often get such pleasant company here.
Board's over there on the table by the radio.
We play three nights a week.
But not tonight
First night we've missed in nearly two years.
9- A-U-E calling C-Y-7-B.
9- A-U-E
C- Q-ing C-Y-7-B.
Hope everything's all right
Say, what's the matter, Mac?
Why don't you answer? This is Russell speaking
Try again in 15 minutes.
If still missing, will report to Winnipeg.
If still missing, will report to Winnipeg
Standing by
- What is he going to report?
- That an accident might have happened to me.
- He's got to do something about it.
- Why Winnipeg?
- It's the head office of our company.
- What company?
The Hudson's Bay Company
Hirth.
Tell me, uh... do you really march around in Berlin doing this?
- Yes.
- Oh.
Why?
- I tell you, I know what I'm talking about
- You always do, don't you?
 We're not in the ship now
The whole position's entirely different
You seem to forget that I'm a high party member, one of the first million in 1930.
You didn't even join till 1936.
One of the first 70 million — that's you.
And I'm a practical man too.
I'm not a dreamer, an idealist, like you.
It's all a question of experience.
I'm an engineer. I understand ships, radio, planes, and I understand human nature.
I tell you, I'm right, Hirth.
They must play chess!
Our position is too dangerous to allow one of these men a free hand with the radio.
- Free hand? With my gun at the back of his head?
- That makes no difference.
Do you want that noisy American butting in and causing trouble? He's going to notify Winnipeg.
They'll have heard about our submarine being bombed, and they'll put two and two together.
I'm right, Hirth.
They must play chess.
My move
Pawn H-2 takes G-3
Pawn H-2 takes G-3 Standing by
- I told you not to make that move
- I know what I'm doing. Watch me.
 Why should I watch you, may I ask?
The game's lost
I haven't lost a game in two years
You haven't lost this one yet, have you?
- Are you ready?
- Aye, I'm ready.
Pawn B-7 to B-5.
Why did my wife have to go to a double feature the one night I had you on the run?
But you come to the wrong man.
I won't guide you to the railroad, me.
- You never make it anyhow.
- Why not?
This is one big country.
But very few people.
Everyone know everybody.
You can't make a goose step through it without the police find out.
But no one has seen us.
Ah! Penses tu? Écoute
If one husky dog have the smell of you... his boss know from the way he howl... that there is stranger in district.
One Eskimo might find your track.
Maybe have.
Most likely that Eskimo is on his way to Mounted Police right now.
Perhaps, perhaps.
But you must help us.
After all, it's your own interest, now that your country has surrendered.
My country? Surrender?
At 12:30 on the 17 th ofJune, 1940...
France laid down her arms.
France? Ah!
I'm Canadian!
Certainly.
You are a French-Canadian.
But after the war, the führer intends to liberate your people from the British tyranny.
Comment? How?
French Canada will be free.
You will be free.
I am free!
Or, I was plenty free till you guys got in.
I mean the freedom of your people, an oppressed minority.
The freedom to speak their own language, to have their own schools and churches... to govern their own affairs.
Here you will find it written in the führer's own words.
Perhaps you've read it.
Uh, I have no room in my pack for any book.
I know my Bible.
That's enough for me.
This is the Bible. You must get a copy.
It will explain everything to you as it has to me.
You better look up how to get out of Canada, then.
Maybe she don't tell you that, huh?
Ah! Quelle écriture funny.
Maybe, uh, your führer ain't so smart as he think.
Don't he know that we French Canadians have always our own school?
And church.
And the right to speak as we want.
And run our own affair, by golly.
No doubt you have certain privileges, but I don't feel —
Let me ask you one question.
Well?
How about them, uh...
Poles?
How 'bout the French?
Do you let them run their own affair?
That is different.
The whole new order in Europe —
Okay, okay.
You said enough.
Hello! Hello!
Russell speaking.
Say, my wife's just brought in an extra.
The whole front page is covered with news about that submarine your flyers knocked off up there.
Tell him the headline reads
"Nazi U-boat —"
 Oh, Maude, quit yelling and
give me the paper I want to read it to them
 Homer Russell, you'll do no such thing
It's my story, and I stick to it
 Don't be a heel
Mac'll wanna hear about it
Then take a back seat and I'll read it.
Hello! Hello! Is that you, Mac?
This is Maude speaking.
It says the submarine was sunk
right in your backyard I'll read it to you
"Nazi U-boat sunk in Hudson Bay."
That's the headline.
"A German submarine believed to be the U-37
was destroyed in Hudson Bay
"near Wolstenholme by Canadian
coastal command patrol planes
"According to an official report...
"the squadron leader claimed that several direct hits by medium bombs...
"were scored
before the Nazis could submerge
He circled the spot
and found no signs of any survivors "
There's a whole lot more to it,
but that's the gist of it
- How come you didn't know about it?
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Get your rifles.
- Come out.
You can't leave him there like that.
Dirty lot of murderers.
 Vogel, see if they've
heard anything outside
Killers That's all you are
Killers
- All quiet, Herr Leutnant
- Good.
Can't have heard the shot.
Johnnie?
Johnnie.
Johnnie, my son.
It's nearly 1:00.
It'll be three, four hours before there's anybody about.
If anybody should come to the post, we'll see they don't get away.
Kranz, Lohrmann, get him into the other room.
- What about the radio?
- Dead.
I wonder if that American in Michigan got anything.
Idiot!
- Well, that should do it, Vogel, eh?
- Yes, Herr Leutnant.
- But if you were to—
- Shut up!
- Hear anything, Herr Leutnant?
- Shut up, can't you?
I've got it! Wake him up! Quickly!
- Herr Leutnant!
- Jahner.
- What is it?
- Come on here!
Winnipeg Hudson's Bay Company
They're sending a plane
- What kind of a plane?
- An emergency plane from Churchill!
It'll be here in three hours There's
a police boat coming too, from Lake Harbor
- Johnnie.
- We've got to get out quickly
 Unless we can
get hold of that plane they're sending
The company's sending a plane.
- Who can handle a plane?
- I can.
- Anyone else handle a plane?
- No, Herr Leutnant
- No, Herr Leutnant
- You don't doubt that I have the experience.
- How many flying hours?
- Enough.
It'll have to be you then.
Lohrmann Vogel
What about our clothes?
We can't go like this.
- You mean our uniforms?
- Don't be a sentimental fool.
Can't expect to escape in these outfits.
You're right, for once.
Men, this is our one chance of escape.
Our only one. We must be ready for it.
We must have new clothes, money, food, rifles, ammunition.
- Where do you keep the money?
- There is none.
- Don't lie to me. You sell things here.
- Not for money. It's exchange, barter.
Plenty of coats, Herr Leutnant
What's the trouble at the post?
What's happened to the factor?
Nothing happen at the post.
My son go to white man yesterday.
No come back yet.
Anybody else at the post?
TrapperJohnnie.
Stay one day.
I'm a German officer.
I warn you not to resist.
- Run, Les!
- Fire!
Aim low.
Cease fire! Kranz, stand guard!
Kuhnecke and Lohrmann, get the boats loaded.
Jahner! Vogel!
Report to me when ready!
Hey, you.
Give him some water.
It's behind me.
You're a Christian, aren't you?
No, I'm not.
Rosary.
What's he trying to say?
He wants his rosary.
What's the good of that to him?
When —
When... we win... the war... we... send you... some... missionaries.
All ready, Herr Leutnant
Thanks, laddie
Contact!
I can't take off!
We're overloaded!
Throw something out!
Jahner.
That'll do!
Still no use!
Everything'll have to go!
- Everything!
- Throw out the rifles!
- How low is the gas?
- It's all right.
Are you sure we have enough? Our maximum speed seems to be about 145 kilometers an hour.
A hundred and sixty.
Herr Leutnant, there's a note here.
- Can't risk it.
- Seems a shorter course.
Yes, but longer over the sea.
Some of the magnetic variations up here are as much as 40 degrees.
By taking 269 degrees... we can pick up the bush railway down the coast as far as Lake Winnipeg.
But we'll need 15 flying hours.
- Do you hear?
- I'm not deaf.
Well, have we enough gas, or haven't we?
Yes!
- Are we out of gas?
- Can't be!
Emergency tank.
Had to switch over, that's all.
- I suppose the emergency tank is full.
- Of course.
When we filled up at Wolstenholme, did you check the emergency tank?
Did you check the emergency tank?
What difference does it make whether I checked it or not?
- Well, did you or didn't you?
- Very well then! No!
- You've got us into a mess!
- Don't shout at me!
I'm trying to take control!
We'll make a forced landing if we have to.
Forced landing? What good is that to us?
We're 200 kilometers from the border!
Well, I can't think of everything, can I?
I can't help it if I make a mistake sometimes!
Anyway, you're supposed to be in command!
Why don't you handle the thing yourself?
I wish I could!
- We're going to crash! What should we do?
- Nothing! Hang on!
There's a lake ahead!
- All right! I'm not blind!
- Parachute!
- Sit down!
- We'll never make it! Can't you lift her a little?
- Leave me alone, can't you!
- Any orders, Herr Leutnant?
- No! Save yourselves, if you can!
- Jump!
- No! Sit down!
Hold on tight, everybody.
I'm gonna try something!
That's better. Better.
- Throw something out!
- What?
A cushion! Anything!
I can't see the surface!
- What is —This isn't —
- I can't see!
I can't see to land!
For God's sake, tell me what to do!
Out! Out!
- I'll get out, Herr Leutnant!
- Out! Out!
Vogel! Vogel!
All right, Herr Leutnant!
Herr Leutnant! Herr Leutnant!
Herr Leutnant!
He's dead.
So that's Kuhnecke.
Look out!
It's a woman!
German
- German?
- The girl has a German newspaper.
- Germans here?
- Why not?
There are half a million of us in Canada.
Vogel, go speak to her. See what you can find out.
Don't try to be too clever.
Keep as near to the truth as you can.
- Hello
- Hello.
- That's a good-looking scarecrow
- Mmm.
Why, you're only a kid.
I thought you were much older in that getup.
I'm 16.
Are you looking for work?
Yes. How did you know?
You don't look like a hobo.
- Reaping started?
- Just begun.
- Are you on your own?
- Oh, those. Those are my pals.
- All right
- I thought they were your pals.
- Why?
- Seasonal workers always travel in gangs.
Well, these are my pals.
- This is —
- Anna.
Anna. She's 16.
It isn't true. I shouldn't lie.
I shall be 16 the day after tomorrow.
It's only a difference of two days.
Yes, but Peter says there's no difference at all between a small lie and a big lie.
- Who is Peter?
- Our leader
- Oh, so you have a leader.
- Yes A wonderful leader
You'll meet him
Aren't you coming to the settlement?
There isn't another for eight miles.
I told her we were looking for work.
We should be glad to, but, uh, there are four of us.
Don't worry. When 111 people sit down for supper, four more won't make any difference.
Did you say 111?
Thirty-nine brothers,
47 sisters and 25 children.
Hmm. What are you? Mormons?
Mormons?
No. Hutterites.
I didn't mean we were all one family.
We're only brothers and sisters in God.
Hurry up, boy.
You are a slow boy.
Anna, more bread for our guests.
We're sorry about the bread.
Mmm.
I know a bit about baking.
If you don't mind my saying so, you ought to get a new baker.
- We had a good one, but he went to Small Springs.
- Mmm. Better pay?
Pay?
Oh, no one gets paid here.
- Doesn't anyone get paid anything?
- No.
Well, what do you work for, then?
Just your keep?
No. For us all.
What, all these people work for nothing?
- Yeah.
- What sort of work?
Whatever suits them best.
Well, what do you mean?
They don't choose themselves, do they?
- Haven't you got a leader of the community?
- Yes. There he is over there.
Where?
Which is your leader?
There.
Third from the right.
Well, doesn't he tell the people what sort of job they've got to do?
Oh, no.
We tell him what we want to do.
Then how can he be your leader?
How do you mean?
Well, anyone works at whatever job they like, then.
Yeah, that's right.
If somebody can make shoes, he makes shoes.
If he wants to be a blacksmith, he works in the forge.
If somebody feels he can preach, well, he preaches.
Well, what's your specialty?
I'm... the baker.
When you sell your stuff in Winnipeg, what happens to the money?
We buy new tractors, build houses, found new settlements.
We just founded a new one over at Small Springs.
And if someone leaves you and then wants to come back, don't you punish them?
- Punish?
- Yes.
Don't you send them to a camp or something?
Camp? Why a camp?
No, we just take them back because our religion tells us to.
- The Hutterite religion?
- The Christian religion.
Is it one of your rules to sing like this?
We haven't any rules. We sing because we like to. It's good for the digestion.
Well, good night.
The leader will look after you.
- Thank you.
- What's the salute?
The what?
Don't you give the leader a salute?
- Good evening, friends.
- Good evening.
On behalf of my friends and myself,
I have to thank you for your kindness... in giving us food and shelter.
You're welcome.
I hear you come from up north in the woods, or down north, as we call it here.
Yes.
- Just come out?
- Last week.
Are you Germans?
I ask, are you Germans?
Yes.
Are you ashamed of it?
Of course not.
I'll show you where to sleep.
Thank you
Most of us are Germans
You may find some from the same part
of the old country as yourselves
Anna, I thought you would have told them all about us.
We mostly discussed birthdays.
Well, it's quite an event with us, the 16th birthday.
It means that one has grown up at last.
Come in, please.
This house belonged to Hugo Waldner... one of our brothers who has gone to the new settlement.
- At Small Springs?
- Yes.
You see, we are like bees.
If we get too many, we send out a swarm.
So the house is empty and at your service.
Good night.
- Sleep well.
- Good night
Hmm.
That's what I call a busy girl.
It's nothing.
I make 14 beds every night.
That's a lot of work.
We have a lot of men who have no mothers and who aren't married yet.
- So somebody has to make their beds.
- Quite right.
Two of you can sleep in here,
and there are two more beds in the other room
- Where do you sleep?
- In Peter's house.
- In Peter's house?
- But I don't make the bed for him
- Poor Peter. Why not?
- Because he has a mother to look after him.
Haven't you a mother?
No. She was drowned.
Drowned?
In the sea.
When we left Germany... we went to England... because we had to wait until we got a permit to come to Canada.
We got our permit after war was declared.
Was your father with you?
Wait a minute.
I want to hear about her mother.
Her ship was sunk.
Torpedoed?
I think so.
Don't you know?
Was there a big explosion?
Shut up, you two.
You and your questions.
Don't answer them, Anna
Oh, leave that.
- Run along now.
- I'll take her home.
All right, you take her.
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night.
Chins up.
Remember then, do nothing without orders
Discipline is more important
now than ever
So far, luck has been with us
It's a great stroke of fortune
being here at all
- Do you think they are friendly, Herr Leutnant?
- Friendly? Yes.
But you saw how their leader tried to draw us out.
"Are you Germans?
Are you ashamed of being Germans?"
- That in a country with which we are at war.
- There can only be one answer to that.
Our agents have done their work well.
Yes. This religion may be nothing but a cover.
I bet they sing the "Horst Wessel" song better than hymns.
We shall see that tomorrow.
Heil Hitler
Heil Hitler!
Shut the door.
Well, Vogel, who knows?
Perhaps one day the story of our adventures
will all be written in a book
In a few years time, it may be the basis of compulsory lectures to the Hitler Youth.
The ships we sank, with women and children aboard... the lifeboats we shelled — mmm, we were good at that.
What we did to the Eskimos at the post... the unarmed men we shot in the back.
You forget, Vogel, we're at war.
We can't expect to win without the methods of total warfare.
Men, women and children — they're all our enemies and must be treated as such.
Did you never read what Bismarck said?
"Leave them only their eyes to weep with."
"Leave them only their eyes to weep with."
Did he say that?
Those were his actual words
in the war of 1870
You should study Bismarck
He was a great German
A great German.
You know, Vogel,
I'm worried about you.
You're a good fellow, but you don't discipline yourself.
You give way to emotions
That'll land you in trouble one of these days
Why don't you take an example from Kranz,
a fine, soldierly fellow
You could be just as good a Nazi as he is if you tried.
- Are you listening, Vogel?
- Yes, Herr Leutnant.
- Then think it over.
- Yes, Herr Leutnant.
- And get out of bed and turn out the light.
- Yes, Herr Leutnant.
Vogel, I —
- Herr Leutnant?
- Either of you seen Vogel?
- No, Herr Leutnant
- Well, get dressed at once.
- Good morning, friend.
- Good morning.
He's asking for you.
Oh? All right.
Well? Aren't you going?
Well, I can't go till I've got this lot ready.
What shall I tell him?
I'll be along in a minute.
 Now, where's this new baker
I hear about, eh?
Now, that's what I call bread.
You'll have to teach David the trick
 Trick or no trick,
I could never make bread as good as that
Cheer up, David.
It took me seven years.
- Why ever did you want to give it up?
- I didn't want to give it up. I had to.
You see, we all had —
 Peter!
Just come and look at this bread!
Good morning, friend.
Mr. Vogel is the best baker we've had here in 15 years.
I can't imagine
why his last boss let him go
Must have been crazy
lfhe wasn't then, he is now
Congratulations, Vogel.
It was a good idea.
Round the barn!
What's the news in Winnipeg?
The market was good for geese.
People are asking for Hutterite geese.
I don't like that, Andreas.
No?
For 300 years our brethren have wandered from place to place... from country to country... because of the jealousy of others.
This is a good country, Andreas.
- I met Frau Habermann.
- Yes? Oh, her trial was on today, wasn't it?
Her husband and her eldest son, Eric, are to be interned. She is free.
Bad luck... just at harvest time.
It wasn't a good day for the trial.
Papers are full of stories about those Germans who landed from a U-boat down north.
They seem to have acted like wild beasts, killing and stealing.
- What's Frau Habermann going to do?
- I had a talk with her.
- She needs help on the farm.
- It'll be difficult.
We'll talk it over. Tell the others we'll have a meeting tonight, yes?
Air's heavy.
I'm afraid we're going to have a storm tonight.
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late, Peter.
Barbarina, there's an electric storm playing all around us... frightening the animals and your chickens.
- Move over, Philip.
- What about you, Anna?
- Andreas.
- Huh?
- One of our guests is speaking.
- Eh? What? Oh! Good!
We're discussing the Habermanns.
I was about to say... you have one clear choice.
Where there is a question of blood... where one is governed by the deepest of racial instincts... then every other consideration is swept aside.
Men like yourself—
German, or of German ancestry—
rise up with all the might and power
of the great German people behind you conscious of the sacred duty that binds us all together... and in the knowledge that he who doesn't forget his people... will not by his people be forgotten.
There is a new wind blowing from the east... a great storm coming across the sea...
a hurricane which will sweep aside
all the old, outmoded ways oflife
and mark the beginning of a new order,
not only for Europe
but for the whole world
Let those beware who would have the temerity to stand in its way.
They will go down before its irresistible impulse... and be crushed out of existence!
But for those who accept the new order
or those who perhaps belong to it already why need I use these parables of speech any longer?
I mean, all of you here tonight — yes, you, brothers —
I call you brothers and proudly acknowledge you as such.
You who formed a little stronghold of our people here in Canada... you will have your share of the happiness and prosperity... that is waiting for us all when the storm is over and the sun rises — that mighty sun —
which will give us
everything we need in life
What sun are you talking about, friend?
I am talking of the greatest idea in history— supremacy of the Nordic race, the German people.
I am talking of the being whose name
I am certain lives in every heart... whose name hangs on all our lips... whether we can shout it to the world or only whisper it in one another's ears.
Germans!
Brothers!
I ask you to join with me in paying homage to our glorious führer.
Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler!
I don't ask where you come from or what brought you here... although you've left us in no doubt as to your beliefs.
Someone has given you, no doubt deliberately... a completely false impression of us.
We are only one amongst many foreign settlements in Canada.
There are thousands of them in this part of the world.
And they have been founded, some recently, some 80 years ago... by people who left their homes in Europe because of famine... because of starvation... because of racial and political persecution... and some, like ourselves, because of their faith.
Some came only to find new land
new boundaries, a new world
But all have found here in Canada... the security... the peace and tolerance and understanding... which, in Europe... it is your führer's pride to have stamped out.
You call us Germans
You call us brothers.
Yes. Most of us are Germans.
Our names are German.
Our tongue is German.
Our old handwritten books are in German script.
But we are not your brothers.
Our Germany is dead.
However hard this may be for some of us older people... it's a blessing for our children.
Our children grew up against new backgrounds, new horizons.
And they are free... free to grow up as children... free to run and to laugh without being forced into uniforms... without being forced to march up and down the streets... singing battle songs.
You talk about a new order in Europe.
The new order... where there will not be one corner... not a hole big enough for a mouse... where a decent man can breathe freely.
You think we hate you, but we don't
It is against our faith to hate.
We only hate the power of evil which is spreading over the world.
You and your Hitlerism... are like the microbes of some filthy disease... filled with a longing to multiply yourselves... until you destroy everything healthy in the world.
No.
We are not your brothers.
What do you want?
I am come to tell you that you can make your own beds.
I don't want to work for you.
That's all right, Anna Run along now
You're Nazis, aren't you?
Aren't you?
We're not allowed to hate anybody.
But I hate you.
I believed you'd escaped from an internment camp.
I should tell the police about you.
You killed my father... because he said your führer was the Antichrist.
You drowned my mother.
I hate you.
I hate you!
So you're going to tell the police about us, are you?
Little girls should be seen and not heard.
- That will do.
- What's the matter with you?
- That will do!
- Vogel.
Come along, Anna.
I'll take you home.
- Herr Leutnant, we can't let them go.
- I'd like to see what you're going to do about it.
- Vogel!
- Yes, Herr Leutnant
Have you forgotten who you are?
- No, Herr Leutnant.
- Let the girl go and shut the door.
I'll take her home, Herr Leutnant
Is that you, Anna?
Yes, Peter.
I brought Anna home.
She's all right.
We're going now, perhaps in a few minutes.
I only wanted to say that you've been kind and I like it here.
You like my bread, and I like the way you live.
Being with you has made me feel like it used to be at home.
I'd almost forgotten what it was like... baking bread, doing my real work.
That's how it used to be seven years ago before everything changed.
The life I've been living seems to have no sense in it now.
Well, I'd better go now.
Please don't go.
- Are they still talking?
- Hush, child. Go to sleep.
How can a man like you, Vogel —
I mean, you're a simple, good human being.
How can you get mixed up with such a lot of gangsters?
What can you do?
When you're a boy, you like playing soldiers.
When you're a young man, you can't get work unless you belong to them.
When you're an old man, you're anxious not to lose what you've got.
But there are thousands of men like you, Vogel... men who don't like the way things are going.
I suppose so.
I suppose they don't know themselves. I didn't know.
It's as if a blind man said he doesn't know the sun shines.
- I suppose so.
- Why don't you stay with us, Vogel?
- Do you mean it?
- Of course I mean it.
Even if you know who I am, where I come from—
I don't care who you are or where you come from.
- I know you.
- Thank you, Peter.
- It will mean internment.
- What's it matter?
I'll come back after the war.
This is your home.
Engine Room Artificer Vogel
You are under arrest
You are accused of desertion and treachery to the Third Reich.
In the absence of
a properly constituted court
I assume authority as your superior officer
and sentence you to death
Have you anything to say?
The sentence will be carried out immediately in the name of the führer.
"Investigations by the R.C.M. P... have resulted in finding the remains of a Canadian Airways sea plane...
similar to the one stolen
by the five Nazis at Wolstenholme
- Give me the glasses.
- What for?
- Food.
- You can't eat them.
I can sell them.
- They're his.
- Come on, come on.
They belong to the fatherland.
It wouldn't let us starve, would it?
Congratulations, Lohrmann.
No field glass has ever had a better end.
We shall view the future better through these.
- How much did he give you?
- Seven dollars.
Well, what are you waiting for?
You saw what the bulletin said.
They're watching the border.
But they don't know there are only three of us.
They still think there are five.
The police aren't fools.
They'll find out soon enough.
If we're caught, it won't matter whether there are three or five or 10 of us.
We're going to change our plans.
We're going to Vancouver.
Vancouver?
AJapanese ship leaves
Vancouver in a month's time.
- Is it far to Vancouver?
- About 2,000 kilometers.
- We can never get as far as that.
- The führer has never admitted the word "can't."
Neither should we.
Our one consideration must be how to get to —
- Ham sandwich, sir
- How to get home.
Doesn't matter how we do it, but we will get home.
That's how he works.
He says that it's Germany's destiny to rule Europe.
Doesn't matter how she achieves that destiny, but she will achieve it.
He gave me this.
These Canadians give everything away.
The road west is plain enough.
Follow the River Assiniboine for 50 miles.
Do we start now, Herr Leutnant?
No. No, we sleep tonight in the railway station.
Tomorrow we'll catch a bus outside the city limits, then walk.
He wanted us to fly to Vancouver.
Said it would save a lot of time.
- What did you say, Herr Leutnant?
- I said we had plenty of time.
2,000 kilometers is plenty of kilometers.
Those are the Three Sisters Mountains.
We're in the park now
Banff National Park
Today's Indian Day.
It's the biggest crowd of the year.
There will be thousands of Indians.
You should stop over and see it.
I have an appointment in Vancouver.
You say these three men were here?
Well, they were right here.
- Can you describe them?
- Well, let me see, now.
- There's only one that
I would remember right well.
- Corporal.
Ladies and gentlemen.
 Norman, I'm going to use
your mike to talk to the crowd
Attention please.
The mounted police have reason
to suspect that among this crowd
are three enemies of this country
They are not ordinary aliens, escaped from Kananaskis Internment Camp.
They are survivors from a German submarine...
the notorious U-37, which was sunk
in Hudson Bay by our air force
These men are here in this courtyard
They may be standing right next to you
Each one of you, look closely at your neighbor.
These are descriptions of the three men.
One, who appears to be the leader...
is a well-built man of medium height
He has very definite features,
a commanding manner
is clean-shaven, brown hair
He wears a blue suit
and tan shoes
and carries himself
as ifhe'd been drilled
There is no very good description of the second man.
He is thin and inconspicuous
in his manner
He wears a suit of some light color
and a hat tilted over his eyes
He may be carrying a bulky rucksack.
The third man is short and dark.
He wears no hat.
He has a tweed jacket and a bow tie.
He carries a parcel wrapped in oilcloth and tied with thick string.
He is described as being nervous in his manner.
I must ask all of you to stay exactly where you are... and not talk or move.
All of you, as citizens, can help to bring these men to justice.
Each one of you, look closely at your neighbor.
Remember, each one of these men
has every reason to be afraid
They've already been responsible
for the deaths of 11 defenseless people
Sooner or later,
their nerves will crack
Look closely at your neighbor
Corporal, there's your man!
Herr Leutnant, it's a trail.
Hmm, come on then.
Lost?
- Yes.
- That's a difficult trail on foot in those outfits.
- You walked in from the lodge, I suppose
- Yes.
- Any plans?
- Plans?
Well, it'll be dark in an hour.
The moon doesn't rise till 11:00.
A lot of grizzlies on that trail.
- Grizzlies?
- Grizzly bears Touchy beasts
You wouldn't like 'em.
And they wouldn't like you.
I see.
Ah, dinner. You're just in time.
George will be pleased.
Tricky things, aren't they?
The great thing is just to sit still.
- On holiday here?
- Yes, on holiday.
How do you find the lodge?
They used to do you a very good lobster thermidor with a red Bordeaux.
They still do you a lobster, but no more red Bordeaux.
- A nuisance, isn't it?
- Hmm?
The war, I—
Anyhow, up here in the Rockies
the war seems so remote,
one can't take it so seriously
Of course one knows one half of humanity is trying to wipe out the other half, but... up here among the mountains and the spruce forests... one sees it in perspective.
So that it — it seems almost unimportant.
You've chosen a very beautiful place for your holiday.
Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it?
Actually, I'm here to work... on a book.
- Oh, so you're a novelist?
- Well, I write books
My specialty is Indians This has been
a hunting ground of theirs for generations
Then I — I suppose you were at Banff today.
For Indian Day? No, no, no.
That's just for tourists.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Ship ahoy!
Well, gentlemen.
Welcome to my humble tepee.
Got two this time, George
I'm improving
And tell Bob two more for dinner. Well.
It must be very pleasant roughing it up here in the mountains.
Yes, I rather like pigging it occasionally.
I hope you won't mind taking potluck with me.
Here, have a cigarette.
Ah, I see you're looking at my Picasso.
It's nice, isn't it?
Here.
How do you feel about Matisse?
I picked these up about a year ago, and I can't bear to be parted from them.
How do you like it, hmm?
Excellent.
I don't think you two are really interested in pictures.
Well, my motto is, wars may come and wars may go... but art goes on forever.
Ah, you like reading, don't you?
Have you seen Hemingway's latest?
Here. I'm going to show you one of my pets.
There. Thomas Mann,
The Magic Mountain
This is the German edition.
This is wonderful stuff.
By the way, do you speak German?
Have you read this book?
Thomas Mann is very good, I believe.
I'm so sorry. Of course, you'll want a bath after your long climb.
I'm afraid I can only offer you a shower.
Come on. I'll show you the way.
- Thank you very much, Mr. —
- Scott.
Philip Armstrong Scott. Come on.
Philip Armstrong Scott.
Ah, hot water.
I feel completely confident tonight.
If we'd twice as far to go,
I wouldn't worry now.
What could these weaklings ever do to us?
The man's country's at war and look at him.
I tell you, Lohrmann, they're rotten to the core.
There's no fight in them.
They're soft and degenerate all through.
No, I'll have cold.
George, the fire's smoking
South-southeast by south
Ah, that's the ticket
Yes, I've discovered some rather amusing things during my researches.
Blackfoot tribal customs, for instance, closely resemble those... of a certain modern
European tribe.
I'm gonna read you something about that.
Where are we?
"From the earliest age, their small boys were trained in the arts of war...
"which they considered to be the only pursuit worthy of a man.
"But they preferred to attack
by night, rather than by day
"and wherever possible,
to shoot the enemy in the back
"Their smaller neighbors lived in constant danger from them.
"They also believed in first terrorizing their opponent... by covering themselves in war paint and beating loudly on their tribal drums."
Well, doesn't that sound familiar to you?
Familiar?
- I don't quite understand
- Well, what price Goebbels, eh?
- Very similar.
- Yeah, you see, don't you?
And listen to this.
This is wonderful.
Come here, sit down.
Uh, oh, yes.
"When a tribal leader really desired to drive a point home...
"he used that most terrible of all public speaker's weapons: Repetition... constant and unutterably wearisome repetition."
Old man Hitler himself.
- What's wrong?
- I think he found it a little warm in here.
I'm so sorry.
- Well, rather stuffy in there, eh?
- A little.
Lovely night, isn't it?
The moon's just out.
We're not the only ones up, I see.
- The men, eh?
- When do they go to bed?
Oh, pretty early as a rule.
They please themselves.
You must be rather tired yourself.
How about a nightcap before you turn in?
- Thank you.
- Yes.
Well. Interested?
Have a drink?
Well, happy dreams.
Okay
Ah, I thought you'd find it a bit chilly.
We're 6,000 feet up here, you know?
- So you think you'll escape the war, Mr. Scott?
- Hmm?
- That's not a very nice way of putting it.
- But you'll do your best to escape it.
Do you mean I'm —
I wonder if I am.
I don't think I'm a coward.
I've never really been in any great danger.
I don't exactly know how I'd behave.
- I can imagine how you'd behave.
- I beg your pardon?
I said, "I can imagine how you'd behave."
Well, you are an extraordinary fellow.
You're certainly frank.
So you despise my mode of life, eh?
Well, I'm getting some revelations tonight
Maybe it'll do me good
Maybe I'm becoming a little smug
I imagined you'd been thinking,
"Here's a nice, decent sort of chap.
"Invites me to dinner
when he doesn't even know me
Amiable.
Full of interesting conversation."
And instead of that, you think I'm —
Go on, what do you think I am?
This ought to be enlightening.
If you were a real man, you'd have struck me across the face when I suggested you were a coward.
Instead of which, you talk about it.
Well, why not?
I may write about the customs of red Indians 200 years ago... but I don't have to behave like one.
After all, we've been given reasoning powers and the gift of speech.
Why don't we use them instead of hitting each other?
Come on, have a cigarette.
I don't think you're even a coward.
I don't think you're a man at all.
You must've had too much to drink.
You both better get to bed.
Is this gun loaded?
Of course it's loaded.
Then put your hands up.
- What do you mean?
- It's quite plain. Put them up.
Well, well, well.
This is a new experience.
So I've been entertaining gangsters.
Well, what do you want?
Money or what?
You don't believe we'd shoot you, do you?
Such a thing couldn't happen to Mr. Philip Armstrong Scott.
Anything unpleasant must be kept as far away as possible... as far as the war,
5,000 miles away.
Suppose I was to tell you that the war is right here in this tent?
I don't suppose you've heard of the U-boat that was sunk in Hudson Bay and the six Germans who escaped.
So that's who you are — Nazis.
Well, that explains everything.
Your arrogance, your stupidity, your bad manners —
Get over there by your books!
Oh, dear. Do I have to be tied up?
Excuse us, Mr. Scott.
We still employ savage, tribal methods.
They get results.
The best thing that's happened to us is meeting you.
You've put the heart back into us.
There are only two of us now.
Two out of six brave men.
There are millions like us in Germany.
Any more of your sort here, you don't stand a chance of winning this war. We'll see to that.
- Get the clothes out of there.
- Well, they won't suit you.
Not much there, I'm afraid.
- Thirty-three dollars.
- Do I get a receipt?
There's only one suit here
You better have the overcoat
Interesting.
So far, I don't feel the least afraid.
No sign of trembling.
Pulse appears to be quite steady.
Mouth a bit dry perhaps.
Here. Rifles.
Ah, you feel happier now, don't you?
Look out.
Wars may come and wars may go, but art goes on forever, eh?
Stop!
Thomas Mann.
Yes, I have read this book.
We kicked this swine out of the Reich years ago.
There's something else too
"Blackfoot Tribal Customs"
Think yourself lucky we don't burn you too.
Well, I never would've believed that grown-up men... could behave like spiteful little schoolboys.
Have I said something to annoy you?
Then, I forget, anything reasonable annoys you.
- Open your mouth.
- One question, please.
When Hitler's making a speech, just exactly what are your rea —
Damn them horses.
Stampeded again.
- Maybe they got wind of something
- Maybe a bear
There. There they go.
This way.
Who's been leaving a saddle out here?
Confound it!
Here's another one.
Boss must've gone crazy.
You've made a fine mess of things.
You've roused the whole camp.
The horses were your idea.
I knew they'd give trouble.
- You forget yourself, Lohrmann.
- Save your breath, Hirth.
Hey, Bob!
They're gone down by the lake!
Hirth! Not that way!
- Who are you talking to?
- You're not my superior officer now.
- Obey orders and follow me!
- Orders be —
All right.
Come on, George. Art! Art!
Where are you?
- Here, Mr Scott!
- On the trail
- By the waterfall
- Hurry!
- Okay, boss Coming!
- Bob! Bob!
- Over here!
Bob, Bob, Mr Scott wants you!
Okay!
- What's happened, Boss?
- A holdup. Those two fellas —
- No!
- Yes.
- Oh, there's one of them.
- Good old George.
Right here!
Coming your way!
Where are you?
- Looks like he's lost it.
- Confound it.
He's got it, the old bloodhound.
Come on.
Where is he, George? In the cave?
What are we waiting for?
Let's get him
- Which one of them two is it, Boss?
- I don't know. Did you see, George?
All right, George?
I forgot to tell you, Art.
He's got my Colt, too.
See that hole?
That's gonna cost him seven bucks before I let the Mounties get him.
That means he's got four shots left.
All right, Bob I'll take over now
- Okay, Boss, but I don't think you ought to take any—
- Let me stay with you, Mr. Scott.
- The papers say these men are killers.
- Yes, the Canadian papers.
The Nazi papers call them heroes.
Two brave Nazis against 11 million Canadians.
Say, Mr. Scott.
Mr. Scott.
Stop him
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
That's the lot.
Oh, it's you
I hoped it was the other fellow
That's for Thomas Mann
That's for Matisse
That's for Picasso
And that's for me
All right, you can fetch him out now.
You all right, Boss?
Well, you can't expect me to capture an armed Nazi without getting hurt a little.
- Yet —
- Here. Let me have a look at that.
The boss has knocked him cold.
Well, he had a fair chance.
One armed superman... against one unarmed decadent democrat.
I wonder how Dr. Goebbels will explain that.
"Leutnant Hirth
"wherever you may be on the North American continent...
"I hail you as the paladin of the Third Reich...
"and the upholder of the honor of the great German people.
"By express order of the führer himself...
"you have today been invested with the iron cross, first class.
Heil Hitler."
"Flash: Lethbridge, Alberta.
Mounted police pick up trail of escaping Nazi.
"At Lethbridge Airport, Kenyon Field...
"it's been established that a man resembling the wanted man...
Lieutenant Hirth, planed in yesterday
on Trip 22 from Edmonton and Calgary "
"The hearts of all sympathizers with the German cause go out to Leutnant Hirth
"One man against 11 million.
"They know that even now, the odds are not too heavy...
"when the one man represents the might of the Third Reich... and the 11 million, a collapsing democracy."
"Forty-eight hours have elapsed and still Lieutenant Ernst Hirth...
"the only surviving Nazi from the U-37, is at large.
"The whole world's eyes are on southern Ontario.
The question of the hour is:
Where is Hirth?"
You'll be okay here. I'll let you know when you get to the falls.
Much obliged
Say, what's your name?
Oh, forget it I haven't seen you
and you haven't seen me
Hello
You bummin'a ride?
Yes.
You needn't be afraid of me.
I won't split on you.
I'm not afraid.
Looks like you got a nice private car.
Have a cigarette.
Sit down.
Thank you.
- Comin' from Toronto?
- Yes.
- Livin' there, maybe?
- No.
- Quite a place, Toronto.
- I didn't see much of it.
- Are you from the west?
- Well, I've been there.
- Vancouver?
- Yes.
That must be a beautiful city, Vancouver.
I didn't stay there long either.
- You don't stay long anywhere, do you?
- Well, I travel about a good deal.
Travel about.
That's a lot of fun.
When I was a kid, I had the big idea to see the whole of Canada.
But things don't work out the way you think.
I save a bit of money, and what do I do?
Put it in my pocket and start off down the road... my own boss, with the whole of Canada in front of me?
Not on your life.
I buy a bit of land up Beamsville way.
And that keeps me so busy, that's about all of Canada I see.
Have a shot of Ontario wine.
Catawba.
I send the grapes to the winery from my own farm.
- Sherry-type.
- Thank you.
Got a kick like a mule.
Where was I? Oh, yeah.
Sometimes I think I'll take a holiday.
But do I take a holiday?
Not a bit of it.
I take a wife.
Say, were there any M.P.'s around while you've been here?
- M.P.'s?
- Military police.
- Are you in trouble with the police?
- Not exactly what you'd call trouble.
I just don't wanna meet 'em, that's all.
- Are you a soldier?
- Well, that's a matter of opinion.
That's what I joined up to be.
The government said,
"We want men to fight the Nazis. Join today."
So I joined.
I figured they were in a hurry.
That was 387 days ago.
Four divisions and a lot of drafts have gone overseas... and what's Number B-987642 doing?
Guardin' the Chippewa Canal.
Who'd wanna steal it anyway?
Well, I guess I better climb back into my battle rompers.
Do you think your government have treated you badly?
Well, what do you think?
I didn't enlist to play nursemaid
I enlisted to knock hell out of the Nazis.
I'm about as close to getting my hands on a Jerry now as I was at the beginning.
We don't eat so good
Holy mackinaw, beef, three times a day.
Haven't tasted parsnips since I joined the army.
- I'm fond of parsnips, too.
- Why are you afraid of the police?
Who's afraid of the police?
I just overstayed my leave eight days.
That is a serious offense in wartime.
- Says who? My CO?
- You're a deserter.
Deserter, my royal Canadian foot.
I'm just independent.
You're a deserter because you have a legitimate grievance against your democratic government.
Say, where did you pick up those five-gallon words?
You have a good suit.
Sure, it's a good suit.
Paid 25 bucks for it two years ago.
And along comes that heel, Hitler
- It's a very good suit.
- It's a dandy suit
Just now, most of the boys are wearin' these.
Yes.
- Well, I'm a son of a —
- Stand up.
Put your hands up.
Stand over there.
Unless you're anxious to be shot, you won't move.
I'm perfectly ready to kill you or anyone else.
Yeah, I can see you are.
- Fourteen drums of carbide.
- Don't move.
- Fourteen drums
- Who's movin'?
Nine cans germicide.
Okay.
Everything checks all right.
Okay, then seal her up.
Now look what you done.
I am a deserter now.
- What do you mean?
- They're taking us clear out of the country.
- Out of the country?
- Into the States. We're crossin' the border now.
Into America?
Heil Hitler.
- You dirty Nazi.
- Yes, I'm a Nazi. Heil Hitler.
- One of them off the U-boat.
- Quite right, my friend.
In two minutes,
I shall be across the border.
Once there were six of us.
Now I represent them all.
Field Marshall Göring has said...
"It doesn't matter as long as we have only one plane and one man left, so long as victory is ours."
Do you hear that?
We've beaten these dirty democracies, these weaklings.
I tell you, we've something inside us... something beyond the dim, muddied minds of you in the democracies.
What do you know of the glorious,
mystical ties ofblood and race that unite me with every German Aryan?
When I step on American soil,
I shall not be alone.
Adolf Hitler and all the great
German people will be with me
It is not the Canadian people we're against.
It's your filthy government, the whole democratic system.
You don't like it any more than I do.
You don't like the job they've given you.
- You don't like the food. You said so yourself.
- Why, you spoon-fed louse.
I can grouse about the food and the C.O.
And anything I blame please.
And that's more than you with your
Gestapo and your storm troopers and your Aryan bourgeois.
Aw, nuts.
What's the good of talkin' to you?
You can't even begin
to understand democracy
We own the right to be fed up with anything we damn please... and say so out loud when we feel like it.
And when things go wrong, we can take it.
We can dish it out too.
 Hey, Eddie
Wait a minute Hold the door
Thanks.
- Hey, Eddie
- Yeah.
- You check and I'll mark.
- How about you checkin'and me markin',
just for a change, huh?
Go on and wrestle some boxes.
It'll be good for you.
Yeah, sure, sure.
Hey.
Lady Godiva
Who are you two?
- I'm Andrew Brock,
Canadian Active Service Force.
- You don't look it. And you?
- We're on American territory?
- Yes.
I am Ernst Hirth, a German citizen. I demand to be taken to the nearest German consulate.
Don't do it. Send him back.
He's an escaping Nazi.
He slugged me.
That's my uniform.
- Hey, this gun is loaded.
- No.
By your American law, you must take me to my consul.
- Is that right?
- I'm afraid it is.
- He's one of that gang off the German submarine, the U-37.
- On the level?
I am Leutnant Hirth of the German Navy and also a German citizen. And I demand —
You've got to send him back.
He's not just an escaping Nazi. He's important.
The whole German nation is waiting to see if he can get away with it.
- I know. I read the papers.
- Hey, couldn't we sort of—You know?
- You mean?
- Yeah.
No.
- By your own law, you must take me to my consul.
- Sometimes I think we got too many laws.
- Don't let him pull that law stuff!
- You know better than that, soldier.
I'm a customs inspector.
This is for the immigration department.
My job's inspecting and checking on freights and imports.
Listen, Captain. What would you do if he were an illegal shipment of... cheese?
Return him
But he's a human being
- At least he's a Nazi.
- He's not on the manifest, is he?
- What?
- I said, "He's not on the manifest."
- No.
- No.
- No, he's not.
- The American law —
- Aw, shut up.
- I know the law
It says, "Imports are not admissible
unless properly manifested "
I find two items not listed
- How do you check?
- Same way. Two unlisted items.
But your law refers to freight, not to persons.
This is a freight car, and you're freight.
- Tell the engineer to return this car.
- Okay.
Phone those Canucks and tell 'em it's coming
with two items missing from the manifest
- Tell 'em to either list 'em or take 'em off
- Check.
Thanks, Colonel. Thanks a million.
We've all got to do our duty, soldier.
- I'll send your gun back to the Mounties.
- Okay. I don't need it.
I protest. You cannot do this.
It's illegal.
Sonny boy, I've done it.
Hello, Macaulay? It's Eddie speakin'.
We're sendin' back car number 8772.
Gee, you guys are gettin' careless.
There's two items not in the manifest.
Now, either list 'em or take 'em off.
Put 'em up, Nazi.
No, not that way. This way.
'Cause I'm not askin' for those pants.
I'm just takin' 'em.
Say, buddy, will you stake a fellow...
Hey, mister, will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
- State lottery, señor?
- Beat it. I ain't buying no lottery tickets.
4,000 pesos is the big prize.
Get away from me, you little beggar.
The whole ticket is only 4 pesos.
It's a sure winner.
I ain't got 4 pesos.
Buy a quarter of a ticket for 1 peso silver.
If you don't get away from me,
I'll throw this water right in your face.
Then one tenth of a ticket, señor, for 40...
Señor, buy one twentieth.
One twentieth costs you only 20 centavos.
Look, señor, add the figures up.
You get 13.
What better number could you buy?
It's a sure winner.
- Yeah, how soon's the drawing?
- Only three weeks off.
Give me a twentieth so I don't have to look at your ugly face.
Come again next time.
I always have the winners, all the lucky numbers. Good luck.
Thirteen.
Excuse me.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
- It's hot.
- Yeah.
What a town, Tampico.
You said it, brother.
If I could get a job that'd bring enough to buy passage...
I'd shake its dust off my feet soon enough, you bet.
If I was a native,
I'd get a can of shoe polish... and I'd be in business.
They'd never let a gringo.
You can sit on a bench till you're three-quarters starved.
You can beg from another gringo, or even commit burglary.
You try shining shoes in the street... or peddling lemonade out of a bucket and your hash is settled.
You'll never get another job from an American.
Yeah, and the natives would hound and pester you to death.
- Some town to be broke in.
- What town isn't?
Can you stake a fellow American to a meal?
Hey, mister.
Will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
Such impudence never came my way.
Early this afternoon, I gave you money.
When my shoes were being polished,
I gave you more.
Now you put the bite on me again.
Do me a favor.
Go occasionally to somebody else.
- It's beginning to get tiresome.
- Excuse me. I didn't know it was you.
I never looked at your face, just your hands and the money you gave me.
Beg pardon. I promise
I'll never put the bite on you again.
This is the very last you get from me.
Just to make sure you don't forget your promise, here's another peso.
- Thanks, mister.
- But from now on... you have to make your way through life without my assistance.
Hey, buddy, will you stake a fellow American to a meal?
I won't give you a red cent.
If you want to make some money
I'll give you a job.
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.
I got a job if you want.
It's hard work, but good pay.
- Did you ever rig a camp?
- Sure.
The ferry's making off, one of my men hasn't shown up.
I don't know what's happened to him.
He's probably drunk in some dive.
- What's the pay?
- $8 a day.
Don't just stand there.
Make up your mind, the ferry doesn't wait.
- I'm your man.
- Come on.
- Hello, there.
- Hello, yourself.
Okay, you guys, get aboard.
Take it your way.
What's the matter with you two?
Can't you take it?
It's 130 in the shade, and there ain't any shade up there on that derrick.
Just figure you're a couple of millionaires in your own private steam bath.
And the sooner we're through... the sooner we'll be back in town drinking cold beer.
We finish within two weeks,
I'm giving you fellas a bonus.
Yeah, it's coming to us working 16, 18 hours a day like we do.
Don't go crying to your mamas.
What do you want?
I'm paying top salaries and a bonus.
What about our pay anyway, and when do we get it?
- I ain't seen a buck out of you yet.
- You'll get your dough, all right... don't worry about that, when we get back to Tampico.
What could you do with money out here anyway, except gamble and lose it?
You'll be paid as we step off the ferry.
The agent was supposed to be here with the dough.
Don't know what could've happened.
But don't worry.
I'll go to the office and pick up the money.
You men stay here.
Any objection to a couple of us coming with you?
Don't you trust me?
You think I'd run out on you?
I don't think you'd do that.
But I ain't got a cent, not even enough to buy me a glass of beer.
Say, you two guys meet me over at the Cantina Madrid.
It's 2:15 now and I'll be over there no later than 3:00.
Pat McCormick.
He comes here from time to time.
I haven't seen him lately.
Pat McCormick?
What about Pat McCormick?
- He's supposed to meet us here.
- Does he owe you any money?
Say, how long you guys been around Tampico, anyway?
What's that got to do with it?
Only foreigners and half-baked Americans fall for McCormick's tricks.
How do you mean?
I mean, he hires dumb guys like you to work for him.
When it comes time to pay off, he takes a powder.
How much we got left of that $10 he gave us, Dobbsie?
- That's not even enough for one bed.
I know a joint that's full of rats, scorpions and cockroaches.
The cots are only 50 centavos a night.
Have another...
...jobs that were a dime a dozen ain't to be had at all.
Streets are full of guys... pushing each other over a meal.
Gold in Mexico? Sure there is.
Not 10 days from here by rail.
The mountain's waiting for the right guy to discover and take her treasure.
The question is: Are you the right guy?
Real bonanzas are few and far between.
They take a lot of finding.
Answer me this, will you?
Why is gold worth some $20 an ounce?
- I don't know. Because it's scarce.
- A thousand men go searching for gold.
After six months one of them's lucky.
One out of the thousand.
His find represents not only his own labor but that of 999 others to boot.
That's 6,000 months, 500 years... scrambling over mountain, going hungry and thirsty.
The gold is worth what it is 'cause of the human labor that went into finding it.
- Never thought of it like that.
- There's no other explanation.
Gold ain't good for nothing except for making jewelry and gold teeth.
Gold's a devilish sort of thing.
You start out to tell yourself you'll be satisfied with $25,000 worth.
So help me Lord and cross my heart.
Fine resolution.
After months of sweating yourself dizzy, few provisions, finding nothing... you finally come down to $15,000, then $10,000.
Finally you say,
"Lord, let me just find $5,000 worth...
"and I'll never ask for anything more the rest of my life."
$5,000 is a lot of money.
In this joint it seems like a lot.
But if you made a real strike, you couldn't be dragged away.
Even the threat of death wouldn't keep you from adding $10,000 more.
$10,000, you'd want $25,000.
$25,000, you'd want $50,000.
$50,000, $100,000. Like roulette.
One more turn, you know.
Always one more.
It wouldn't be that way with me.
I swear, it wouldn't.
I'd take only what I set out to get.
Even if there was still $500,000 worth... lying around, waiting to be picked up.
I've dug in Alaska and Canada and Colorado.
I was in the British Honduras,
I made my fare back home... and almost enough over to cure me of the fever I'd caught.
Dug in California and Australia.
All over the world practically.
Yeah. I know what gold does to men's souls.
You talk as though you struck it rich sometime or other, pop.
How about it?
Then what are you doing in here, a down-and-outer?
That's gold. That's what it makes us.
Never knew a prospector yet that died rich.
Make one fortune, he's sure to blow it trying to find another.
I'm no exception to the rule.
Sure I'm a gnawed old bone now but don't you guys think the spirit's gone.
I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe if anybody's willing to share expenses.
I'd rather go by myself.
It's best to go alone.
But you got to have a stomach for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.
But going with a partner is dangerous.
Murder is always lurking about.
Partners accusing each other of all sorts of crimes.
As long as there's no find, the noble brotherhood will last.
But when the piles of gold begin to grow, that's when the trouble starts.
I wouldn't mind a little of that kind of trouble.
I think I'll go to sleep... and dream about piles of gold... getting bigger and bigger.
Do you believe what the old man... who was doing all the talking at the Oso Negro... said the other night... about gold changing a man's soul so that he ain't the same kind of a guy... that he was before finding it?
Guess that all depends on the man.
That's exactly what I say.
Gold don't carry any curse with it.
It all depends on whether or not the guy who finds it is the right guy.
The way I see it... gold can be as much of a blessing as a curse.
Look who's coming out of the Hotel Bristol.
Is that Pat McCormick or am I seeing things?
It's him.
- Let's get him.
- Let's get him hard.
Why don't you and me go and buy me something?
I could use a new pair of shoes.
Hello, fellows, how are you?
Glad to see you.
- Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Curtin, Señorita...
- López.
López. I want you guys to come and have a drink with me.
I've got business to attend to with these men.
You go back up the hotel and wait.
I won't be long.
Okay.
Fellas, let's have that drink.
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
Three shots of rye.
Make mine brandy, Three Star.
- Two brandies.
- Rye is good enough for me.
I suppose you're wondering about that money that's coming to you.
The fact is I haven't been paid off on that contract myself.
If I had the money, you'd get it first thing.
I'll put you both on my next contract.
It will come through by Monday and we can set out Friday.
Here's mud in your eye.
We want what's coming to us.
We want it right here and now.
- But didn't I just tell you...
- You better come across.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 25º% .
I guess I can make it 30º% .
And the balance, say, the middle of next week?
Nothing doing. Right here and now.
Every cent or you won't walk out of here.
You'll be carried out.
Let's don't stop being friends.
How about another drink?
Two more brandies.
Put the bottle on the bar.
If you want to get us liquored up...
No, I'm just inviting you to have a friendly drink with me.
- I'm licked, boys.
- Give us our money.
Yeah, give us our money.
I can't see.
- That's it, ain't it, Curt?
- Yeah, that's it.
Let's beat it before the law arrives.
Here's for the drinks and the use of the cantina.
- You know something, Curt?
- What?
We ain't very smart, hanging around Tampico waiting for a job.
Money's getting shorter every day... and soon we'll be right back where we were, on the bum again... pushing guys for dimes, sleeping around in freight cars.
That's right. Got any ideas?
That old man in the Oso Negro started me to thinking.
What about?
Why not try gold-digging for a change?
It ain't any riskier than waiting around here for a break... and this is the country where the nuggets of gold are crying for you... to take them out of the ground, make them shinin' coins... on the fingers and necks of swell dames.
One thing, living in the open is cheaper than it is here in Tampico.
Our money'd last longer.
The longer it lasts, the greater our chance of digging something up would be.
We'd have to have equipment, all right.
Picks and spades, pans, burros.
Wonder how much it would all cost.
- That old man would know.
- Yeah, he could give us some pointers.
He's too old to take along.
We'd have to pack him on our backs.
You can't tell about some of those old guys.
It's surprising sometimes how tough they are.
I don't know what gold looks like in the ground.
I've only seen it in jewelry store windows and people's mouths.
You know anything about prospecting?
Not much when you come right down to it.
We might have real use for an experienced guy like that old-timer.
Let's go hunt him up right away.
Will I go? What a question.
Of course I'll go.
Any time, any day,
I was waiting for somebody to ask me.
Out for gold? I'm always at your service.
I got $300 ready cash in the bank.
$200 of it all set to invest.
Last money I got.
When it's gone, I'm finished.
If you don't take a risk, you can't make a gain.
How much dough you guys got to put in?
I've got $150 and Curtin's got the same.
$500 ain't hardly enough to buy tools, weapons and essential provisions.
What do we need weapons for?
Meat's one thing and bandits another.
Bandit country's where we'd be going.
We need $600 between us.
- That much?
- Can't you dig up any more?
Not a red cent.
Give me my money, señor!
10º% I get for selling the winning ticket.
Get away from me, will you?
Please, señor.
Whoever draws the lucky number... gives a present to the seller...
I don't want any lottery ticket!
If you don't, you have bad luck the rest of your life.
What? Wait a minute.
What did you first say?
Why, he's trying to tell you he sold you the winning ticket.
Hey, wait a minute.
This what you mean?
- You say it's the winner?
- 200 peso prize.
Where?
- That's my number.
- Sure enough.
Just look at that fat, rich, printed number.
That's the kind of sugar poppa likes.
200 pesos.
Welcome, sweet little smackeroos.
Here, son, here's a present for you with my blessing.
Would you like to shake the hand that bought that ticket?
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, yourself.
You stand to profit out of this the same as I do.
How do you make that out?
Didn't he just say we needed $600?
That's what we've got now, ain't it?
- Yeah, but...
- But what?
- Why are you putting up for me?
- This is an all-or-nothing proposition.
If we make a find, we'll be lighting our cigars with $100 bills.
If not, the difference between what you and I put up... ain't enough to keep me from being where I was this afternoon:
Polishing a bench with the seat of my pants.
Put her there, part.
We'll buy our burros at Perla and head northwest away from the railroad.
It's no use looking near a railroad... or any kind of a road at all... because construction engineers examine every bit of ground around the road... while they're building them.
We got to go where there's no trails... where no surveyor or anyone who knows anything of prospecting has been before.
The best place to go to is... where any salaried person wouldn't go, because he wouldn't want to risk his hide.
I got three of them!
How many did you get?
- A couple.
- I'm one up. I bet I got more than you did.
I got three. Nice shooting?
That bullet hole's two inches from my head. That was close.
The bullets were sure flying thick and fast in here.
It sounded like a swarm of bees here.
That bandit with the gold hat,
I had my sights on him, nice as you please.
The train gave a jolt and I missed.
Wish I'd got him.
Big boulder on the track so train stop.
Bandits got big surprise because soldiers on the train waiting for them.
Not many passengers get killed.
Here's where we're bound for.
Don't show whether there's mountain, swamp or desert.
That shows the makers of the map don't know.
Once on the ground, we open our eyes and look around.
Blow our noses, too.
Believe it or not, I knew a fellow... who could smell gold like a jackass can smell water.
What's all that about?
We're going into country very wild and dangerous.
Have to cut through jungles... and climb mountains so high they rise above the clouds.
Tigers so strong they can climb trees with burros in their mouths. Good.
Glad to hear such tall tales 'cause it means few outsiders have set foot there.
Well, let's get going.
If there was gold in them mountains, how long would it have been there?
Millions and millions of years, wouldn't it?
What's our hurry?
A couple of days more or less ain't going to make any difference.
Remember what you said back in Tampico... about having to pack that old man on our backs?
That was when I took him for an ordinary human being... not part goat.
Look at him climb, will you?
What gets me is how he can go all day in the sun without any water.
Maybe he's part camel, too.
If I'd known what prospecting meant...
I'd have stayed in Tampico and waited for another job to turn up.
- What's the matter?
- Look.
Look at it glitter. It's yellow, too, like...
Gold.
Come back, we've found something!
Look, Curt, there's a vein of it, here, in this rock.
Look here. Look, it's all around.
What else could it be?
Only gold shines and glitters like that.
We've struck it, Curt.
Look, from the looks of things... we've struck it rich.
Look, it's all over here.
- We found a what do you call it...
- Mother lode.
- That's right.
- Howard!
Come on. Look.
Here, look at this rock.
It's full of gold. Veins of it.
This stuff wouldn't pay your dinner for a carload.
It ain't gold?
Pyrite. Fool's gold.
Not that there ain't plenty of the real stuff here.
We've walked over it four or five times.
A place yesterday looked like rich diggings, but the water... for washing the sand was 11 miles away.
The other places, there wasn't much gold to pay us a good day's wages.
Next time you strike it rich, holler for me... before you start splashing water around.
Water's precious.
Sometimes it can be more precious than gold.
Burro.
- What's up?
- Norther, looks like.
A "norther"? What's a "norther"?
Big winds from the north this time of year... when they blow hard, this desert country stands right up on its hind legs!
There's only a few more miles of this heavy stuff.
Pretty soon we'll be out of this valley.
You fellows, how about some beans?
You want some beans?
Going through some mighty rough country tomorrow. You better have some beans.
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking we ought to give up... leave the whole outfit... everything behind.
Go back to civilization.
What's that you say? Go back?
Tell my old grandmother!
I got two elegant bedfellows who kick at the first drop of rain... and hide in the closet when thunder rumbles.
What great prospectors.
Two shoe clerks reading about prospecting for gold... in the Land of the Midnight Sun, south of the border or west of the Rockies.
Shut your trap or I'll smash your head flat!
Go ahead, throw it. If you did, you'd never leave this place alive.
Without me, you two would die here more miserable than rats.
Leave him alone.
Can't you see the old man's nuts?
Nuts, am I? Let me tell you something, my fine bedfellows.
There's nothing to compare you with.
You're dumber than the dumbest jackass.
Look at each other.
Did you ever see anything like yourself for being dumb specimens?
You're so dumb... you don't even see the riches you're treading on with your own feet.
Don't expect to find nuggets of molten gold.
It's not that rich.
Here ain't the place to dig.
It comes from someplace further up.
Up there.
Up there's where we've got to go.
- Is that it?
- That's it, all right.
Gold, I mean.
Sure don't look like I thought it would.
- Not much different from sand.
- Yeah. It's just like plain sand.
It don't glitter. I thought it would.
It will when it's refined by some other guy.
All we got to do is mine it and get it back there.
Gold ain't like stones in a riverbed.
It don't cry out to be picked up.
You got to know how to recognize it.
The finding ain't all. Not by a long shot.
Got to know how to tickle her so she'll come out laughing.
Yeah, it's mighty rich. It'll pay good.
- How good?
- About 20 ounces to the ton.
- That's $20 an ounce.
- How many tons can we handle a week?
Depends on how hard we work.
We better pitch our camp down the mountainside.
Why, when the digging's here?
Anyone comes by, we say we're hunters, and get away with it maybe.
- Wouldn't it be easier to file a claim?
- Easier but not so profitable.
An emissary from a big mining company would be here soon... with a paper in his hand showing we had no right to be here.
How does it feel to be men of property?
The tanks'll leak some at first... until the boards begin to swell and close the seams.
I sure had some cockeyed ideas about prospecting for gold.
It was all in the finding, I thought.
I thought you just had to find it, pick it up, put it in sacks... and carry them off to the nearest bank.
You're learning. Pretty soon
I won't be able to tell you a thing.
- Tank full yet?
- Right to the top.
Open the sluice gate.
How much do you figure it to be now?
About $5,000 worth, I reckon.
When are we going to start dividing it up?
Anytime you say.
Why divide it at all? I don't see any point.
We're all going back together when the time comes.
Why not wait till we get paid and then divide the money?
Either way suits me. You fellows decide.
I'm for dividing it up as we go along.
Make each guy responsible for his own goods.
I'd just as soon have it that way.
I don't like the responsibility of guarding your treasure.
Who asked you to?
That's right. You never asked me.
Only, I thought I was the most trustworthy of the three.
You?
How come?
I said the most trustworthy. As far as being the most honest, no one can say.
I don't get you.
Suppose you're charged of taking care of the goods.
One day I'm deep in the brush and Curtin's on his way to get provisions.
That'd be your chance to pack up and leave us in the cold.
Only a guy that's a thief at heart would think me likely to do a thing like that.
Right now, it wouldn't be worth your while... but when the pile's grown to 300 ounces, think of such things you will.
How's about yourself?
I'm not quick on my feet any longer.
You're a lot tougher than when we started out.
By the time the pile's grown to be really tempting...
I won't be able to run half as fast as you.
You'd catch me and string me up in no time.
That's why I think
I'm the most trustworthy.
Looking at it that way,
I guess you're right.
Maybe it'd be a good idea... to cut the proceeds up three ways every night.
It'll relieve you of a responsibility you don't like.
Swell by me.
After we got a couple of hundred ounces... it'll be a nuisance carrying bags around our necks.
Each of us will have to hide his share from the others.
And after that, he'll have to be forever on watch that his hiding place's not found.
What a dirty, filthy mind you've got.
Not dirty, baby.
Only I know what kind of ideas... even supposedly decent people get when gold's at stake.
All right.
Here she goes three ways.
Dobbs!
Howard, come quick!
He's coming around.
Lay still a minute till you get your senses back.
What happened?
Part of the mine caved in on you.
Got a knock on the head.
No bones broken?
I don't think so.
- Who pulled me out?
- Curtin did.
I owe my life to you, partner.
Forget it.
What'll you do with your hard-earned money... when we get back and cash in?
I'm getting along in years.
I can still hold up my end... when it comes to a hard day's work, but I'm not the man I was once.
Next year, next month, next week, by thunder, won't be the man I'm today.
I think I'll settle down in a quiet place... get a little business, hardware, grocery store... spend the better part of my time reading comics and adventure stories.
One thing's for sure.
I won't go prospecting again... wasting time and money trying to find another gold mine.
How about yourself?
What plans have you, if any?
I figure on buying some land and growing fruit. Peaches, maybe.
How did you come to settle on peaches?
One summer, when I was a kid...
I worked as a picker in a peach harvest in the San Joaquin Valley.
Boy, it sure was something.
Hundreds of people, old and young.
Whole families working together.
At night, after a day's work... we used to build big bonfires and sit around and sing to guitar music.
Till morning sometimes.
We'd go to sleep, wake up and sing, and go to sleep again.
Everybody had a wonderful time.
Ever since then I've had a hankering to be a fruit grower.
It must be grand watching your own trees put on leaves... come into blossom and bear.
Watching the fruit get big and ripe on the boughs, ready for picking.
What's all that about?
We're telling each other what we aim to do when we get back.
Now me, I got it all figured out what I'm gonna do.
Tell us about it, Dobbsie.
First off, I'm going to a Turkish bath to sweat and soak... till I get all the grime and dirt out of my system.
Then I'm going to a haberdasher and gonna get myself a brand-new set of duds.
Dozen of everything.
Then I'm going to a swell cafe... order everything on the bill o' fare and if it ain't just right... or maybe even if it is,
I'm gonna bawl the waiter out... and make him take the whole thing back.
What's next on the program?
Well, what would be?
If I were you, I wouldn't talk or think about women.
It ain't good for your health.
Yeah, maybe you're right, seeing how the prospects are far off.
You know what?
We ought to put a limit on our take, agree between us... when we get so much we pull up stakes and beat it.
- What do you think the limit ought to be?
- Say $25,000 worth apiece.
$25,000, small potatoes.
How much do you say?
$50,000 anyway,
$75,000 would be more like it.
That'd take a year if the vein held out, which wouldn't be likely.
What's a year more or less when that kind of money is to be had?
$25,000 is plenty as far as I'm concerned.
Enough to last me the rest of my lifetime.
Well, sure, you're old, I'm young.
I need dough and plenty of it.
$25,000 in one piece... is more than I ever expected to get my hands on.
Small potatoes.
There's no use making hogs of ourselves.
Hog, am I?
Maybe you don't know, but I'd be within my rights... if I demanded half again as much as you get.
How come?
There's no denying I put up the lion's share of the cash.
So you did, Dobbsie, and I always meant to pay you back.
In any civilized place the biggest investor gets the biggest return, don't he?
That's one thing in favor of the wilds.
Not that I intended to demand it, but I'd be within my rights if I did.
Next time you call me a hog just remember... what I could've done if I'd wanted to.
I think it'd be wise not to put things strictly on a money basis.
Here you are, Dobbs.
What I owe you with interest.
I just don't like being called a hog, that's all.
Don't scare me like that.
I might have let you have it.
Out for a midnight stroll?
Tiger around,
I went to check on the burros.
- So?
- What's the matter?
- I think I'll see if the burros are all right.
- Go ahead. Help yourself.
- What's up?
- Nothing's up.
Where is Dobbs?
Poking around in the dark out there.
He's sure taking a long time out there.
I think I'll go have a look-see.
Where's Curtin?
He's out there somewhere.
Said he was gonna have a look-see.
It's my turn again but I won't take it... if you stop worrying about your goods and go to bed.
We got work to do tomorrow.
Can't catch me sleeping.
Don't you ever believe that.
I'm not that dumb.
The day you try to put anything over on me... it'll be a costly one for both of you.
Any more lip out of you and I'll up and let you have it.
If you know what's good for you, you won't monkey around with Fred C. Dobbs.
You ought to see Dobbs.
He's talking to himself a mile a minute.
Something's eating him all right,
I don't know what.
He's just spoiling for trouble.
"We're running short of provisions,
Dobbsie.
"How about you going to the village?"
Who does Howard think he is, ordering me around?
What's that, Dobbs?
- Nothing.
- Better look out.
It's a bad sign when a guy talks to himself.
Yeah? Who else am I gonna talk to?
Certainly not you or Curtin.
- Fine partners you two are.
- Got something up your nose?
Blow it out, it'll do you good.
Don't think you two are putting anything over on me.
- Take it easy.
- I know what your game is.
You know more than I do.
Why am I elected to go to the village instead of you or Curtin?
Don't think I don't see through that.
You two are together against me.
The two days I'd be gone... would give you lots of time to discover where my goods are.
If you fear along those lines... why don't you take your goods with you?
And run the risk of having them taken from me by bandits?
If you run into them, you'd be out of luck anyway.
They'd kill you for the shoes on your feet.
So that's it. Everything's clear now.
You're hoping bandits will get me.
That would save you a lot of trouble, wouldn't it?
And your consciences wouldn't bother you none neither.
All right, Dobbs, forget about it.
Just like I thought.
- What's the idea?
- Put your hands up.
I've a good mind to haul off and pump you up, chest and belly alike.
Would you mind telling me what this is about?
It won't get you anywhere playing dumb.
Well, I'll be.
- So that's where your goods are hidden?
- Hey, what's the trouble here?
Seems like I accidentally stumbled on Dobbsie's treasure.
Accidentally? Why were you trying to pry up that rock?
I saw a gila monster crawl under it.
Brother, I got to hand it to you.
You can certainly pick up a good story when you need one.
Okay, I'm a liar.
There isn't a gila monster under there.
Let's see you stick your hand in and get your goods out.
- Go ahead.
- Sure I will.
But you try any bad moves...
Don't worry. I'll stay right where I am.
I want to see this.
Reach in and get your goods.
If you don't, we'll think you're yellow, won't we, Howard?
They never let go, do they, Howard, once they grab onto you?
You can cut them in two and the head will still hang on till sundown, I hear.
By that time the victim doesn't usually care 'cause he's dead.
- Isn't that right, Howard?
- I reckon.
Why don't you stick your hand in and get your treasure?
Couldn't be because you're scared... after the way you've been shooting your mouth off?
Show us you ain't yellow.
I'd hate to think my partner had a yellow streak up his back.
I'll kill you, you dirty, thieving...
Okay, Howard, I got him covered.
Another bad move out of you and I'll blow you to kingdom come.
Howard, turn that rock over, will you?
The federales are very efficient.
Yeah. Bandidos, eh?
Yeah, seems between them they had a diamond ring... pearl earrings, a lot of money and a railway ticket... with the date of the Aguascalientes train robbery on it.
They've been here several days, drinking, shooting...
The villagers are afraid to go out of their huts.
Where are they taking them now?
To the cemetery.
The federales don't operate in our American way.
They're not fingerprint experts, but they can follow any trail.
Against them, no hideout is any use.
They know all the tricks of the bandits.
You can bet your sweet soul they'll trace down... every last one of that group that attacked the train.
It'll take time, months maybe, but they'll do it.
Not many Americans get around this way.
You're the first
I've bumped into in a long time.
That so?
- Mighty rugged country hereabouts.
- Yeah.
My name's Cody.
I'm from Texas.
- What's your game?
- I'm a hunter.
- Professional?
- Yeah.
What all do you hunt?
Tiger cats, anything of commercial value.
How long did you say you'd been in these mountains?
A few months.
Ever seen anything that looked like pay dirt?
I've a hunch there's loads of the real goods up in those mountains.
No, I know the whole landscape around here.
If there'd been gold, you can bet I'd have seen it.
There's nothing doing here for gold.
I can look at a hill five miles away... and tell you if it carries an ounce or a shipload.
If you haven't found anything...
I'll come with you, put your nose in it.
There's indications in the valley, lots of indications.
By tracing the rocks,
I find they come from a ridge... washed down by the tropical rains.
- You don't say so.
- Yes, I say so.
So much for those bandits.
You gotta hand it to the Mexicans when it comes to swift justice.
Once the federales get their mitts on a criminal... they know what to do.
They hand him a shovel, tell him to dig.
When he's dug deep enough... they tell him to put the shovel down, smoke a cigarette and say his prayers.
In another five minutes he's being covered over with the earth he dug out.
Yeah, you gotta hand it to them all right.
I meant what I said about going along with you. Those are my burros.
I'm ready to start if you'll let me go with you to your camp.
Thanks anyway, but I prefer going it by myself.
Good luck.
I went way around, stayed on hard ground which wouldn't show the tracks.
Every time I hit a high point and looked
I'd see he was still following me.
I guess it's only a matter of time till he shows up here.
- I move we tell him straight off to beat it.
- Now, no, that'd be foolish.
He'd sit for an hour playing the innocent and then report us to the officials.
Once they come, we can't stay or take our goods with us if we left.
There's nothing else to do but kill him the minute he appears.
No crime to visit these mountains.
He may be a guy that likes to wander.
You can't shoot him for that.
If you were to shoot him it might come out.
We don't have to shoot him necessarily.
We can push him off a rock and claim it was an accident.
Just who's gonna do the pushing, you?
We'll toss for it.
You're sure he was trailing you, are you?
- Absolutely.
- How come?
Because there he is.
Come over by the fire.
I know quite well, you fellas, I'm not wanted here.
Even after what you told me...
I couldn't resist the desire to sit and jaw with an American.
Why don't you go where Americans want to talk to you?
Durango isn't too far off.
They got one of them American clubs there.
I'm not after that.
I've got other things on my mind, more important.
So do we. Don't make any mistakes.
Our biggest worry is your presence here.
We got no use for you.
We don't even want you for a cook or a dishwasher.
No vacancies, understand?
In case I don't make myself clear, you'll be doing yourself a favor... packing up and getting out tomorrow morning.
Go back where you came from.
Take our blessings with you.
Thanks.
Go ahead. Help yourself. We're no misers.
We don't let guys starve to death.
Tonight, you're our guest.
But tomorrow morning...
Iook out, no trespassing around here, you know?
"Beware of the dogs." Get it?
I got myself five foxes and a lion while you were away at the village.
- How are the hides?
- Pretty good.
- Where'd you hit them?
- Right through their eyes.
Excuse me for butting in, but there's no game here worth going after.
It wouldn't take a week for a hunter... to clean up all around for five miles in each direction.
Yes, there's no good hunting here.
That's why we made up our mind to leave... so that we could look for something better.
Yes, stranger, you're dead right.
Awful poor ground.
It took us some time to find it out.
Poor ground, you say?
Depends on what you're looking for.
For game, yes.
Mighty good ground for something else.
What might that be?
Gold.
That's a good one.
I told you in the village, there's no gold around here.
If there was one single ounce of it,
I'd have seen it, believe me.
If you haven't found any gold here, you're not as smart as you appear to be.
Well, maybe, you're right.
Who knows?
We never thought about gold.
Gives me an idea.
Guess I'll sleep on it.
I'll hit the hay.
Yeah. Me, too.
See you in the morning, mister.
I can't figure this bird out.
Is he wise to us or not?
Whether he is or not, he looks fairly harmless to me.
- Looks can be mighty deceiving.
- No denying that.
I'm keeping my boots on this night.
Might take it in his head to murder us in our sleep.
- Anything can happen. I'll tell you what.
- Well, then?
You guys go to sleep and I'll be watchdog for a few hours.
Then you both can take your turns.
- Okay. Got your gun handy?
- Yeah. Right here.
Good morning, friend.
Where'd you get the water to make coffee?
- I took it out of the olla.
- You did, did you?
We didn't carry that water here for you to make coffee.
- I didn't know water was so hard to get.
- You know it now.
I'll fill it up for you.
What's up?
I caught this guy stealing our water.
The next time I'll let it out of you through little round holes.
I thought I was among civilized men who wouldn't begrudge me fresh water.
Who's not civilized?
I could easily do the same for you.
It's not settled yet who'd come out on top.
This time I took it.
Thanks for your kind attention.
If I was you, stranger,
I'd pack up and go while the going's good.
I mean to stay right here.
The brush and the mountains are free, aren't they?
Sure. That's right, whoever's first on the spot.
That holds for hunters, but not for gold miners.
Unless they have happened to have registered their claim.
Who says we have a claim to register?
Whatever you say or don't say, tomorrow I start to dig for gold here.
I know you guys can bump me off any minute... but that's a risk worth running considering the stakes.
Let's lay all our cards on the table.
As I see it, you guys have to do one of three things:
Kill me, run me off or take me in with you as a partner.
Let's consider the first.
Another guy may come along tomorrow.
Maybe a dozen other guys.
If you start killing them... how far are you prepared to go?
Ask yourselves that.
Also, don't forget, the one actually to do the bumping off... would forever be in the power of the other two.
The only safe way would be for all of you to drag out your cannons... and bang away at the same instant like a firing squad.
We wouldn't stop at anything to protect our interests.
I claim killing me isn't it.
But, of course, that's for you to decide.
As for choice number two... you run me off,
I might very well inform on you.
We'd get you if you did that.
We'd get you if we had to go all the way to China.
25º% of the value of your find is the reward I'd get.
And that would be mighty tempting.
It's a strong argument in favor of number one.
I don't deny it.
But let's see what number three has to offer.
If you take me in as a partner, you don't stand to lose anything.
I'll not ask a share in what you've made so far, only in the profits to come.
What do you say?
Mind, stranger, letting us talk this over among ourselves?
Not at all. Go ahead.
I have to look after my burros anyway.
- What do you think?
- Sending him away is out of the question.
Either we bump him off or make him a partner.
F.C. Dobbs ain't a guy that likes being taken advantage of.
Do the mug in, I say.
He told us how, didn't he?
All of us hold out our cannons and let him have it.
What do we gain by bumping him off?
If he was asking to share in what we made it'd be different.
I don't mind being taken advantage of... if it isn't money out of my pocket.
And whoever else comes along... they're to be invited in, too.
Come one, come all?
You got a point there.
No question about that.
But killing...
- What's the matter, ain't you up to it?
- Sure, I'm up to it.
Let the majority decide.
What's your vote, partner?
For or against?
For.
Let's make it short and sweet for him.
So it's number one, is it?
Better take a look down that hill first.
I can't make out what they are.
They must be soldiers.
So that's your stinking game, is it?
Informing. I knew you were an informer.
I knew it all the time.
You're wrong, brother.
This means all our funerals.
What's that?
If it's what I think it is, may the Lord be with us.
They're not soldiers, they're bandits.
After guns and ammunition, not gold.
Some villager must have told them about the American hunter.
They don't look like soldiers to me, either.
They are bandits.
We better start thinking of a way to defend ourselves.
We can hide in the rocks but we'll lose the burros and the whole outfit.
The best thing is to fight.
You have good eyes.
Stay here on this lookout... for the time being and watch their movements.
You herd all the burros in that thicket there.
Dobbs, we'll wrap up all our belongings and dump them in the trench.
They're turning onto the trail.
- How many of them are there?
- About a dozen.
They'll be an hour getting here so we better eat something.
Come on down, friend.
Look, Howard.
The one in the gold hat, remember?
Yeah, the man in the train robbery.
They think whoever was here is gone.
Some want to go back down the mountains, others want to stay... and use this site as headquarters to raid the villages.
How about pouring it into them?
- Bumping off as many as we can, real fast?
- No, let's hold our horses.
We are federales.
You know, the mounted police.
If you are the police, where are your badges?
Badges? We ain't got no badges.
We don't need no badges.
I don't have to show you any stinking badges.
Better not come any closer.
We didn't try to do you any harm.
Why don't you try to be a little more polite?
Give us your gun and we'll leave you in peace.
I need my gun myself.
Throw that old iron over here.
We'll pick it up and go on our way.
You go anyway without my gun, and go quick.
All right.
Look here, amigo, you got the wrong idea.
We don't want to get your gun for nothing. We want to buy it.
Look, I have a gold watch with a gold chain... made in your own country.
The watch and the chain, they're worth at least 200 pesos.
I'll change it for your gun.
You better take it.
That's a good business for you.
You keep your watch, I'll keep my gun.
Oh, you'll keep it? You will keep it?
We won't get it?
I'll show you.
Anybody get hurt?
Looks like we won that round.
- That guy with the gold hat, ain't he...
- We spotted him, too. The train robber.
- Maybe they got enough?
- I doubt it.
Since they know there's four guns, they'll be more determined than ever.
- What do you suppose they'll pull next?
- No telling. All we can do is sit tight.
Cody, are you all right?
He's dead.
Got it right through the neck.
One less gun.
Chopping wood for camp, that's funny.
If they're up to what I think they are, it ain't funny.
- What's that?
- They're building moving barricades.
An old Indian trick.
They crawl and push the barricades.
You can't see where to shoot.
I'd be willing to trade my share of the mine right now for a few hand grenades.
You'd better get to your posts.
They're beating it.
- What do you make of that?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
Wait a minute, this may be some trick to lure us out.
I don't think so. They ain't good enough actors for this kind of a trick.
Hey, partner. Up here.
Here's a sight if there ever was one.
Federales. Look at them.
I could kiss every one of them.
They must've gotten it from the villagers there were bandits headed here.
Why don't they wait here, make a fight of it?
They know all the tricks, that's why.
With us behind and the federales facing them, they wouldn't have a chance.
Go get them, sic 'em time.
Chew them up and don't spit them out.
Swallow them.
Am I happy.
Tell you the truth,
I was already eating dirt.
I wonder who he is.
And if he's got any folks.
Supposing he has?
Let's take a look at his belongings.
A few hundred pesos.
Name's James Cody. Dallas, Texas.
A letter from Dallas, too.
It must be his home.
Reckon she's his girl.
Not bad.
"Dear Jim: Your letter just arrived.
"It was such a relief to get word after so many months of...
"silence.
"I realize, of course, that...
"there aren't any mailboxes that you can drop a letter in...
"out there in the wild."
You better read it.
"But that doesn't keep me from worrying about you.
"Little Jimmy is fine, but he misses his daddy almost as much as I do.
"He keeps asking,
'When's Daddy coming home? '
"You say if you do not make a real find this time...
"you'll never go again.
"I cannot begin to tell you how my heart rejoices...
"at those words, if you really mean them.
"Now I feel free to tell you...
"I've never thought any material treasure...
"no matter how great, is worth the pain of these long separations.
"The country is especially lovely this year.
"It's been a perfect spring.
Warm rains and hardly any frost.
"The fruit trees are all in bloom.
"The upper orchard looks aflame...
"and the lower, like after a snowstorm.
"Everybody looks forward to big crops.
"I do hope you are back for the harvest.
"Of course, I'm hoping that you will at last strike it rich.
"It is high time for luck...
"to start smiling upon you.
"But just in case she doesn't...
"remember we've already found life's real treasure.
"Forever yours, Helen."
I guess we better dig a hole for him.
Yeah, not so good.
Not so good as yesterday.
Want my opinion?
It'll be a lot less from now on.
We've taken all the gold this mountain has.
How much do you figure we got to date?
Not as much as we were aiming to collect.
Not $40,000.
I'm willing to lower my hindsight.
We've got upwards of $35,000 apiece.
I tell you, we ought to be plenty thankful.
Let's call it quits and pack up and leave.
The sooner the better as far as I'm concerned.
I don't want to keep that dame waiting.
It'll take a week to break the mine, put the mountain back in shape.
Do what to the mountain?
Make her look like she was before we came.
I don't get it.
We wounded this place.
It's our duty to close her wounds.
The least we can do to show our gratitude for all the wealth she's given us.
If you guys don't want to help me,
I'll do it alone.
You talk about that mountain like it was a real woman.
She's been a lot better to me than any woman I ever knew.
Keep your shirt on, old-timer.
Sure, I'll help you.
I reckon that's about everything.
Each man's burros with his goods will be his own responsibility.
Come on.
Goodbye, mountain, and thanks.
Yeah, thanks, mountain.
I've been thinking about her.
Cody's widow, I mean, and the kid.
You know what?
We ought to give them a fourth just as if he'd been our partner from the start.
What? A fourth of all our goods?
- That's right.
- Are you crazy?
If not for him, we wouldn't have walked away from that mountain.
Ask Howard.
The buzzard would have gotten fat on us all right.
Yeah, it might just as well have been one of us.
But it wasn't.
It's our good luck and his bad.
Whatever you guys do,
I'm going to give a fourth.
I got more than I need, anyhow.
Half what I got is enough to last me out.
Fourth? Sure.
You two guys must have been born in a revival meeting.
We got company.
Steady, boys.
Coffee.
Give him some tobacco.
We give them our tobacco, they give us theirs, I don't get it.
Why not everybody smoke his own?
Take some and thank them.
They're after something.
Takes them a while to come to the point.
To say what you want right off the bat isn't considered polite among Indians.
They got nothing but time?
His boy fell in the water, they fished him out.
- He ain't dead, but he just won't come to.
- Tough.
I'll go have a look at the boy.
I'll be back in a little while.
Before morning, probably.
Look after my goods while I am gone.
Tequila.
Artificial respiration did it and a few Boy Scout tricks.
I think it was more shock than drowning.
He hadn't swallowed much water.
Maybe he was stunned while diving.
How did these Indians know we were in this neck of the woods anyhow?
When you're near their villages, don't ask me how, they just know.
What's up?
He's insisting we return to his village and be his guests.
Tell him to forget it.
Tell him he don't owe us a thing.
If he doesn't pay off his debt all the saints will be angry.
This is no laughing matter.
I'm afraid he's determined to take us with him, even if it means force.
I'll handle this.
Wait a minute. You can't fight your way out of this. Put your guns away.
Have every Indian in the mountain on our trail. We'd be scalped in half an hour.
What'd he say then?
It didn't make any difference about you guys but I have to come.
- It's like that, he just wants you.
- Looks like it.
Why don't you go with them?
Stay a few days and we'll meet you in Durango. We'll wait there.
- What about my goods?
- Why don't you take them with you.
If they found out they might forget he was their honored guest and bump him off.
What'll I do? Dump them on the ground?
We'll take them with us if you want us to and wait for you in Durango.
I reckon that's about the only solution.
I bet you'll remember this the next time you try to do a good deed.
Maybe after I've stayed with them they'll give me a horse.
Then I'll be a day or two behind you.
That'll be swell. Good luck, Howard.
Yeah, all the luck in the world.
We'll be lonesome without you. But my Sunday school teacher used to say:
"You got to learn to swallow disappointments in this sad life."
Hurry up and join us.
Look out for those Indian dames.
They tell me they're smart.
One of them squaws might marry you.
Maybe I'll do just that. Pick out a good-looking squaw and marry her.
They're easy to dress, feed and entertain.
They don't nag at you, either.
So long, partners.
See you in Durango.
Ain't it always his burros that won't march in line... stray off the trail and smash their packs against the trees and rocks?
I wish they'd stray off far enough to fall down about 2,000 feet of gorge.
Why'd you offer to carry his goods for him?
As if he couldn't manage by himself.
He knew what he was doing when he turned them over to us.
Mighty cute of him, wasn't it?
What's the use of railing against the old man? It won't do any good.
Save your breath for the next piece of trail.
I'm stopping here for the night.
If you want to go on it's okay with me, but take his burros with you.
They ain't my responsibility.
It's early. We can make four, five miles more before dark.
Nobody ordered you to stay here.
You can go 20 miles more for all I care.
Ordered me?
You?
Who's ordering who to do anything?
You talk like you're boss of this outfit.
Maybe you are, let's hear you say it.
All right, if you can't go any further.
Who says I can't? Don't make me laugh.
I can go four times as far as a mug like you.
But I don't want to. I could if I want to, but I don't want to, see, mug?
What's the use of hollering?
We're started on something and we've got to finish it, like it or not.
We'll camp here.
Wonder what the old man's doing now.
Eating a meal of roast turkey and drinking a bottle of tequila probably.
This is the first day we've had to manage without his help.
Once we get the hang of it, it'll be easier.
How far away do you suppose the railroad is?
- Not so far as the crow flies.
- We ain't crows.
I figure we can reach the high-pass in two days more... then it'll be three or four days to the railroad.
That's figuring no hard luck on the trail, of course.
What's the joke, Dobbsie?
Aren't you going to let me in on it?
In on it? Sure I will.
Sure.
Go ahead, spill it. What's so funny?
I was thinking what a bonehead play that old jackass made...
- when he put all his goods in our keeping.
- What do you mean?
Figured he'd let us do his sweating for him, did he?
- We'll show him.
- What are you getting at?
Can't you see? It's all ours.
We don't go back to Durango at all.
Not at all.
I don't follow you.
Don't be such a sap.
Where did you ever grow up?
All right, to make it clear to a dumbhead like you... we take all his goods and go straight up north and leave the jackass flat.
You aren't serious, are you? You don't really mean what you are saying.
Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing he don't mean.
As long as I'm here and can do anything, you won't touch the old man's goods.
I know exactly what you mean.
You want to take it all for yourself and cut me out.
No, I'm on the level with the old man, like I'd be with you if you weren't here.
Get off your soapbox. You only sound foolish out here in this wilderness.
I know you for what you are.
For a long time I've had my suspicions about you and now I know I've been right.
- What suspicions?
- You're not putting anything over on me.
I see right through you.
For a long time you've wanted to bump me off at the first opportunity... and bury me out here in the bush like a dog... so you could take not only the old man's goods but mine in the bargain.
When you get to Durango safely you'll have a big laugh... thinking how dumb the old man and I were.
You make another move towards me and I'll pull the trigger.
Now, get your hands up.
Come on, get them up.
Was I right, or was I?
You and your Sunday school talk about protecting people's goods.
You. Go on, stand up, and take it like a man.
Come on, get up.
Let go of it.
- The cards are dealt the other way now.
- Yeah.
Now listen to me...
Look, you're all wrong.
Not for a moment did I ever intend to rob you or do you any harm.
Just like I said...
I'd fight for you and yours like I'd fight for the old man's.
If you really mean that give me back my gun.
My pal.
Wouldn't it be better the way things are to separate tomorrow or even tonight?
- That would suit you fine, wouldn't it?
- Why me more than you?
So you could fall on me from behind, sneak up and shoot me in the back.
All right, I'll go first.
And wait for me on the trail to ambush me?
Why wouldn't I do it now if I meant to kill you?
I'll tell you why, because you're yellow.
You don't have the nerve to pull the trigger while I'm looking you in the eye.
If you think like that, there's nothing to do but to tie you up every night.
I'll tell you what. I'll make you a little bet.
Three times 35 is 105.
I'll bet $105,000 you go to sleep before I do.
Get up there at the head of the train.
Get up!
The cards are dealt the other way now, and for the last time. No more shuffling.
- What cards are...
- I'm going to finish this right now.
I won't take orders from you like I had to do today.
- You mean you're going to murder me?
- No, brother, not murder. Your mistake.
I'm doing it to save my life that you'd take from me when I wasn't looking at you.
- The old man'll catch up with you.
- He will, will he?
I got an answer for that one, too.
Know what I'll tell him?
I'll tell him you tied me to a tree and made your getaway taking all our goods.
He'll be looking for you and not me.
Up. March. Today I had to march to your music, now you march to mine.
- Where?
- To your funeral.
Come on, keep going.
Get up. Sleepy?
You'll be asleep soon enough.
Sound asleep.
Maybe I didn't kill him.
Maybe he just staggered and fell down without being hit.
You keep it, it's yours anyhow.
No, they won't find him.
I'll dig a hole for him first thing in the morning.
This fire... don't give much heat.
Conscience.
What a thing.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it'll pester you to death.
But if you don't believe you've got one... what can it do to you?
Makes me sick all this talking and fussing about nonsense.
Maybe I'd better leave him like he is.
Ain't very likely anybody will find him.
In a week, the buzzards and the ants will have done away with him anyway.
I don't know what's getting into me.
Was that really a tiger?
No.
What if his eyes are open, looking at me?
Best thing to do is to get to the railroad in a hurry.
Burro.
It's better not to have buried him.
I did right, yeah.
What I should have done, maybe, was bury his clothes... and leave him to the ants and the buzzards.
Buzzards!
If somebody saw them circling, they'd know something was dead.
Buzzards ain't spotted him yet.
Lucky for me.
Curtin!
Where are you?
I better get a hold of myself.
I mustn't lose my head.
There's one thing certain, he ain't here.
I got it. The tiger.
Yeah, that's it. The tiger must have dragged him off to his lair, that's what.
Yeah, pretty soon, not even the bones will be left to tell the story.
Done as if by order.
I came to in the middle of the night.
My gun was on the ground beside me.
He must have left it there to make it look like suicide.
I figured he'd come back in the morning to see if I still had a flicker of life.
I thought about waiting for him and letting him have it... but there was a good chance in my condition I might miss... so I decided to crawl away like a poisoned dog.
- Take it easy, you're talking too much.
- Don't you worry about me.
I'll pull out of this if only to get that guy.
It appears our fine Mr. Dobbs has made off with our goods and is on his way north.
- Yeah.
- I reckon we can't blame him too much.
What do you mean?
I mean, he's not a real killer, as killers go.
I think he's as honest as the next fella, or almost.
The mistake was leaving you two in the depths of the wilderness... with more than $100,000 between you.
That's a big temptation, partner, believe me.
He shot me down in cold blood.
After I was down he shot me a second time just to make sure.
If I was young and out there with one of you, I'd have been tempted, too.
Maybe I wouldn't have fallen, but I reckon I would've been tempted.
There now. You're almost as good as new.
Now, to find that thief and get our goods back.
They're not only giving me a horse but coming to protect me.
- You ain't going.
- Who says so?
You wouldn't be up to the hard riding.
- You aren't leaving me behind.
- Look at you.
You're weak as a kitten.
Don't worry, I'll look after our interests.
I'm going.
Well, I reckon you're going.
Burro!
Have you got any cigarettes?
No, I haven't. I've got a little tobacco... if that'll do.
No paper to roll it in?
Papers?
Here you are.
- Going to Durango?
- Yeah.
That's where I'm headed.
I've got to sell my burros.
I got to get some money.
I haven't got a red cent.
Matches?
Money? We need money, too.
Yeah? I could use a good mule driver... maybe two or three.
How much is the pay?
Two pesos.
Of course, I can't pay you in advance...
I got to wait till I get to town so I can get the money.
Do I know you from someplace?
Maybe I know you.
No, I don't think so.
- Are you alone?
- No.
I'm not alone.
I got a couple of friends coming along on horseback.
Yeah, they ought to be here any minute.
That's funny.
A man all by himself in bandit country with a string of burros... and his friends behind him on horseback.
Your friends must be very far behind you.
Pablo cannot see any dust even from their horses.
They'll be along any minute, I tell you.
I know who you are.
You're the guy in the hole.
The one who wouldn't give us the rifle.
I never laid eyes on you until now.
What you got in the bags?
- Seems to me like hides.
- Yeah.
That's what they are, hides.
Ought to bring in quite a lot of money.
Yeah.
Sure you don't want to come along with me and help me with the burros?
Burro.
Get away from my burro.
We can sell those burros for just as good a price as you'd get.
Get away from my burro.
You can't frighten even a sick louse with that. You can only shoot one of us... and he wouldn't mind too much.
The federales are after him anyway.
So what with your gun?
- We'll take that chance.
- Get back there.
- Shooting.
- Volley. Execution, probably.
- Dobbs is dead.
- What?
- Bandits got him.
- Our goods. What about our goods?
- What?
- He says our goods are safe in his office.
- It's not here, Howard.
- Keep your shirt on.
What?
He heard the bandits talking while they were waiting to be shot.
They thought it was bags of sand hidden among the hide... to make it weigh more when Dobbs went to sell them.
Where are they?
They're in the ruins outside town.
Come on!
Looks like a norther.
Laugh, Curtin, old boy, it's a great joke played on us... by the Lord, or fate, or nature, whatever you prefer... but whoever or whatever played it certainly had a sense of humor!
The gold has gone back to where we found it!
This is worth ten months of suffering and labor, this joke is!
Well, Howard, what next I wonder?
I'm all fixed as far as I'm concerned as a medicine man.
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want... roof over my head, and a drink now and then to warm me up.
I will be worshipped, fed, and treated like a high priest... for telling people what they want to hear.
Good medicine men are born, not made.
Come and see me sometime, my boy.
Even you'll take off your hat when you see how respected I am.
The day before yesterday, they wanted to make me their legislature.
Their whole legislature!
I don't know what that means. I think it's the highest honor they can bestow.
Yeah, I'm all fixed for the rest of my natural life.
How about yourself?
What do you aim to do?
I haven't got any idea.
You're young. You've got plenty of time to make three or four fortunes.
You know, the worst ain't so bad when it finally happens.
Not half as bad as you figure it'll be before it happens.
I'm no worse off than I was in Tampico.
All I'm out is $200 when you come right down to it.
Not very much compared to what Dobbsie lost.
Any special place you're bent on going?
No, all places are the same to me.
You can keep my share of what the burros and the hides'll bring... if you use it to buy a ticket to Dallas.
See Cody's widow. Better than writing.
And besides, it's July and the fruit harvest.
How about it?
It's a deal.
Well, let's get going.
- Goodbye, Curtin.
- Goodbye, Howard.
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
Oh, for the wings.
For the wings.
Of a dove.
Far away.
Far away would I rove...
Oh, for the wings.
For the wings of a dove.
Far away, far away.
Far away, far away would I rove.
In the wilderness, build me a nest.
And remain there forever at rest.
In the wilderness, build me a nest.
Build me a nest.
And remain there forever at rest.
In the wilderness, build me a nest...
Look, there's one.
- HK. It's one I haven't got.
- Ain't you tired of that lark yet?
"Enthralling new adventure of Selwyn Pike, master sleuth,
"and his youthful assistant, Smiler."
- Wotcher, chaps! Tea's up!
- Joe, any luck today?
No, I went for a job in an undertaker's.
I didn't get it.
- Come and see the boss at our milk bar.
- I might look him up tomorrow.
Load of tripe.
- Found it in the road.
- Listen.
"It was the work of a moment for Smiler to force the window.
"He put one leg over and dropped to the floor."
Where'd he leave the other?
"Two men lay in a pool of blood at his feet."
Brr. I'm scared.
"Pike must be informed at once of this grim new development."
- That's my comic!
- Get out of it!
Get out of it!
"Smiler stepped back towards the window but ere he could reach it,
"the garage door swung open and Larry the Bull loomed up before him.
"Smiler opened his mouth to shout,
"but his cry of desperation was instantly smothered
"as a large, rough hand closed over..."
Well, where's the rest of it?
What do you mean?
It must have blowed away.
That's that.
I'll get you another one in the morning.
Tuppence, please.
Huh, you'll catch me reading that kid's stuff.
Give us the "Trump", please.
'"Selwyn Pike was a fast mover.
"'Eight minutes of breakneck driving brought him to Wilmot Road.
"'Just in time.
"'There was the van.
'"Selwyn Pike was still on its tail when it pulled up in Granville Place.
"'It stopped outside number 813.
"'Two men jumped from it."'
Great Queen Street!
"'Pike watched through narrowed eyes.
"'Yes, there they were.
"'Three wooden crates and the number that Smiler had impressed upon him:
"'Pike frowned.
"'Two crates, two dead men.
But the third crate?
"'Smiler!
'By gad', he ejaculated, 'The fiends!'
"'It seemed only too clear..."'
Mind out, you.
Look where you're going.
Excuse me, sir.
Are you Selwyn Pike?
No, my name is Higgins, sorry.
Three bodies I tell you!
In wooden crates!
You're crackers.
- Scared, are ya?
- Who, me?
- Get out of it.
- OK, let's get on with it.
Agh!
- Well!
- You're hurting me!
- Oh, yes.
- Let go, I'll explain.
You'll explain to the police.
Leave off! Oh!
Lies, lies, lies.
All big lies, I tell you, Inspector.
What I want bodies for in my business?
Mr Jago, please, I'm checking that number.
Sorry, inspector.
Terribly sorry.
But what a story.
Wherever I knew such lies!
You're sure it was GZ 4216?
Sure as I stand here, Inspector.
Just like in that paper.
Very interesting.
You see, there doesn't happen to be a GZ.
See, Inspector?
He makes it all in his head.
Why? He comes to rob my shop.
But I knew it all the time.
You've got your remedy.
I take it you wish to charge this boy.
Yes, I charge him.
You will send him to prison?
Right, we'll all three get along to Bow Street.
To Bow Street? Me? Now? Why?
- You're the one bringing the charge.
- But Inspector, what else shall I bring?
I've told you all I know.
- I'm sorry, you've got to come along.
- Oh, yes, but I can't come now.
I'm waiting for a customer of mine.
He comes at half past nine.
He's a very big customer.
Look here, Mr Jago.
Either you proceed in the proper manner or you drop the charge.
Yes, please, sorry, I haven't understood.
He is a very big customer.
He can't find close to my shop.
You must understand, Inspector.
Well, right.
Well... I'll let the boy go.
What else can I do?
All right, son.
So sorry, Inspector.
I didn't like to waste your time.
If only it would have been tomorrow,
I could have managed.
Sorry.
That was lucky for you, son.
You'd better cut along. Where do you work?
- I'm just looking for a job.
- I see.
Well, watch your step.
- It was GZ 4216.
- Cut it out, son.
Supposing them number plates was false and that bloke was a crook?
He wouldn't have sent for me, would he?
You ought to lay off reading those shockers.
I don't think you're really a bad boy, just a bit imaginative.
- If I put you in the way of a job...
- In the CID?
No, Covent Garden.
Do you know Nightingale's, the fruit and vegetable place?
- No.
- Mr Nightingale is a friend of mine.
He's on the lookout for a bright boy like you.
Take this along to him.
Tell him I sent you.
Detective Inspector Ford.
Send me up some alligators too.
What's that?
Yeah, I could do with a fisherman's daughter.
That's the lot, unless you've got some ins and outs in.
Oh, Jim, those tennis balls are a bit of a duff lot. They're frosted.
How's the missus?
Oh, too bad.
Tell her to rub it with turpentine.
So long.
So you're the young fellow that sees visions on the streets of London?
What's your name?
- Joe Kirby, sir.
- That's right.
Detective Inspector Ford has just been telling me about you. Started young, eh?
- Started what, guv'nor?
- The heebie-jeebies.
- Now, let me give you some advice, Joe.
- Yes, sir.
If ever you see a small jellied eel in striped pyjamas, riding a tricycle up the wall, knock it off, boy.
Don't ever touch another drop.
- Good strong boy, are you?
- I reckon so.
Come here.
Come here, I'm not going to eat you.
Bend it, bend it slowly.
Oh, not a bad bit of muscle there.
All right, Joe, I'll try you out.
30 shillings a week, 5am to 1 pm.
And no daydreams in my time.
I wasn't dreaming.
Tom, this is your new assistant,
Joe Kirby.
Show him the ropes.
And if you find any corpses under those spuds, give me a whistle.
Ho, razor blades, ho!
I got ya.
All elastic, our braces, all elastic!
Razor blades, ho!
All elastic, our braces, all elastic!
- Our elastic braces!
- Razor blades!
What does he get, young Johnson? Two quid a week?
Don't know how he does it. I couldn't afford to play around with girls at his age.
- Now what's his nibs up to?
- Just practising, Dad.
- I've got a job.
- A job, have you?
I hope it's a good steady one this time.
- That's mine.
- I eat the crusts. I'm slimming.
I told you not to start a new loaf before you finish the old.
Tell us, how much are you getting?
- I'm getting 30 bob a week.
- Money isn't everything my lad.
What's the prospects?
I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't given a very important job to do pretty soon.
- In the government?
- In the CID, if you must know.
Never mind about the job you're going to get.
- What about the job you've got?
- It's in Covent Garden.
I was recommended by a detective inspector.
I've got to carry ten baskets on me 'ead.
Well, it's not what I'd call a real safe job, but some of these porters earn good money.
Dad, you know about car numbers?
I'll have a word with Ted Williams.
His son works in the market.
- Why ain't there no cars with GZ?
- I didn't know there wasn't.
It's flowers he goes in for.
Seasonal stuff.
White carnations would go well with my new dance dress.
Joe, try and get us a couple.
White carnations. I've got more important things to worry about.
Like joining the CID?
Some people ain't got the imagination.
I done a bit of good for that detective inspector.
Kept me eyes open and what with this crime wave, I wouldn't be surprised...
You've got a bit of sausage on your chin.
Joe!
Seen any of the others yet?
No, why?
Roy Ellis ain't half been spinning a yarn.
- I should worry.
- He says they fetched a cop along to you.
Detective Inspector.
Detective Inspector!
Coo, what happened?
Nothing much,
'cept he gave me a job.
Wotcher, Dicky.
Look who's walked in.
Found them bodies yet, Joe?
I Three dead corpses rotting in a box I.
- You should have your brains tested.
- I ...rotting in a box
I And if one dead corpse should accidentally rot
I There'll be two dead corpses rotting in a box
I Two dead corpses rotting in a box
I Two dead corpses rotting in a box... I.
Never mind. I bet you gave them cops the best laugh they've had for years!
I've got two more sets complete, Joe.
Don't talk to him about car numbers.
- I've got all the Xs and Gs.
- You ain't got GZ, Arthur, I know that.
- I have.
- You can't have, there ain't one.
Let's see it.
Where?
There. GZ 4216.
I got it this morning.
You give it back!
Shut up all of ya!
Where d'you see it?
On my way to work, coming out of the garage.
Why, what's up?
A garage.
It all fits.
It all fits! The van in the story came out of a garage. They transferred the bodies.
There wasn't any bodies.
You saw that.
- Might mean something else, though.
- What do you mean?
That's right, don't you see?
It's sort of a code.
I bet them furs was stolen.
No, I thought of that.
It can't be. That bloke wouldn't have dared send for the police.
Why not?
- You pipe down.
- Pipe down yourself. Go on, Clarry.
He took a chance the cops wouldn't believe Joe.
Now if he goes to 'em again they'll just laugh.
- He's a crook that bloke in the shop!
- Course he's a crook.
Crooks with a code in a kids' paper
What for anyway?
To get their orders from the boss, like in the stories.
Why don't the boss just tell 'em?
Because he doesn't want them to know who he is.
Yes.
Who is he, then?
Feller that owns the paper?
Might be, or the bloke that writes them stories.
Felix H Wilkinson.
Why not Bing Crosby?
Felix H Wilkinson.
Yeah.
I wonder if he's in the telephone book.
There he is. F H Wilkinson.
Come on.
Your fate is in my hands.
Nothing can save you now.
Nothing.
You're all alone and I have a silencer on this gun.
You've only got five seconds to live...
'the pistol barked.
A spurt of yellow flame.
'Pike's nostrils were assailed by the familiar smell, er...
'Correction, aroma.'
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
We... We thought we was going to be murdered.
The door was open.
Oh!
What a jape, eh?
No, I left the door open for Otto, my cat.
And that's Dick.
Dick the Dictaphone.
Well, look, come in, come in and sit down.
Just one moment.
There you are.
Well, what... what can I do for you?
Well, sir, we've been reading that story of yours about "Mr Pike And The Scarlet Death".
Ah!
My public.
Him being tied to that circular saw and the poison gas seeping in...
Five more days to find out if he gets away...
...Smiler when they drop that black widow spider in the crate...
- We was thinking, Mr Wilkinson...
- You might...
Tell us.
Thank you a thousand times.
This is really the most scrumptious compliment I've ever been paid.
- You will?
- Of course, by all means.
One moment though, I... think this calls for a little liquid refreshment, eh?
What's he going to give us?
I don't know.
Sip it careful.
- Hey, Alec!
- What?
- This. "A Study Of Codes And Ciphers".
- Look out!
Ginger pop.
Come along now, fellows, help yourselves.
No, no, no. Not that one!
Mine has, er... gin in it.
Bung ho!
Mmm! Yum, yum, yum.
And now for the answer to your touching request.
"Selwyn Pike And The Scarlet Death."
Installment number four.
'Crack!
'The sound of the pistol shot echoed and reverberated
'through the sepulchral darkness of the lonely mill.
'Selwyn Pike, his neck a bare six inches from the cruel blades of the whirling saw,
'was aware that something akin to a miracle had occurred.
'He had told nobody of his plan to visit Zanzibar Street.'
- Where?
- What?
What is the matter?
The mill where Mr Pike went was in Lambeth Road.
- I never use real streets in my stories!
- It says Lambeth Road in here.
What?
Oh, crumbs.
What a frightening picture.
So that's what Selwyn Pike looks like.
I say, a bit of a bounder, I'm afraid.
Not at all as I imagined him.
But ain't you never seen this here paper before?
Gracious me, no.
I create these stories.
Why bless my soul, you boys are perfectly right.
It is Lambeth Road!
Now, what on earth induced them to change that?
- Wait.
- Oh!
- And here's a split infinitive.
- Mr Wilkinson...
- And all appearing under my name.
- Mr Wilkinson.
We reckon it's used as a code by crooks.
I'll never live it... What?
Crooks?
My stories?
That there van.
I've seen it in Great Queen Street, unloading three crates.
Another boy saw it too!
Here's the addresses.
By the Lord Harry!
Do you mean my stories have been distorted by some...
- Master criminal.
- Exactly.
Some master criminal, as a means of sending instructions to his, er... minions?
Without betraying his own identity.
Stupendous.
Just like Captain X in "Selwyn Pike
And The Footprints On The Ceiling".
He used the agony column in the "Morning Gazette".
My story.
Let me see that.
"Granville Place, Great Queen Street,
Wilmot Road, Woburn Avenue."
1 from 4 leaves 3, and 16 and 14...
Ah!
Ah-ha!
Got something, have you?
Yes.
- What is it?
- The key.
The key to your precious code, the "London Postal Guide".
Granville Place, turn ten pages and the corresponding position is Great Queen Street!
Just as I thought, with two, three, four added.
- How do you work that out?
- Well may you ask.
The scoundrels have purloined the code I invented for "The Case Of The Limping Skeleton", the child of this brain!
- Who's going to tell the police?
- The police?
Yeah, the cops.
- Tell the police!
- What's the matter?
Huh.
Well...
This is a big powerful gang we've stumbled on!
They would never show a shred of mercy on anyone who... peached on them.
- But if they all get arrested.
- Some may get away.
And they'll be sure to avenge their comrades, ruffians of that breed, like the survivors in
"The Case Of The Crowded Coffins".
They reappeared literally from the grave, to out the throat of poor old Silas Cobleigh.
- See here, Mr Wilkinson...
- And remember.
Remember what happened to Nicky the Nark in "The Case Of The Creeping Death".
Yeah, but those sort of things only happen in stories.
Are you suggesting that stories can never come to life?
Look, don't be rash, boys.
Leave me out of it, I implore you.
Leave me out of it.
I want no part of it at all!
Ah.
Otto.
Come... Otto.
Boys.
Don't forget Nicky the Nark.
Morning, Harry. Nice weather.
Wotcher, mind your backs please!
Yoi-yoi!
Yoi-yoi!
Oi-Oi!
Oi-Oi!
Mind your backs, please.
Oi-oi.
Joe!
I've just been telling the inspector about your latest findings and, er... he'd like to have a word with you.
What's the idea, son?
I thought I'd done you a good turn.
You have too.
Then why do you keep on wasting my time?
All this nonsense about crooks and codes.
But it ain't nonsense, Inspector.
There's a racket being worked.
Here's the codes they're using.
Check that out with the "London Postal Guide" and have a look at this story too.
Did you make this code up?
- Me? No, course I didn't.
- Who did?
Who made up this code?
- It was in a story in the "Trump".
- I thought so.
- I've just about had enough of this.
- I ain't sprucing!
It was in "The Case Of
The Limping Skeleton".
Cut it out!
I've been very patient with you, but you're going to get into serious trouble.
The next time I come here it won't be simply to warn you.
You believe me don't you, guv?
Yeah.
Sure, Joe. Sure.
I believe you.
I even believe in Santa Claus.
Can I carry your bag, Miss Davis?
No thank you, Norman, dear.
Do you work on the "Trump", mate?
- Do you work on the "Trump", mate?
- Yeah, why?
Have you got a date with her or something?
No, sometimes we go the same way, see.
Why? What do you want?
- A peek at next week's story in advance.
- You ain't asking much.
Wait till you've heard what I know.
I reckon Joe ought to have his head examined, blowing the gaff to some Camberwell kid.
And bringing him along here.
How else could we find who's changing the stories?
We'd be proper stuck.
For all we know, that kid's in the racket hisself.
Joe says he's all right.
Did I ask you?
We don't want you.
- Who said so?
- I said so!
Here they come.
Blimey, dapper little beggar, ain't he?
I say, what a shocking place to bring a fellow to!
Turn it up, Roy. This is him, fellers.
Norman Pelley.
Come on.
Who's the crook on your paper?
Be nice to know, wouldn't it?
There's no one at the office altering them stories.
I made sure.
And it can't be the comps.
- That means the printers.
- And Joe said it couldn't be Wilkinson.
- Now who are we left with?
- It doesn't matter about that now.
We've got next week's paper.
- He gave it to me.
- In code?
- We worked it out.
- Ls there a job?
Them crooks are going to bust into Ritchie's.
In the West End?
What, that big place in Oxford Street?
That's it. Ritchie's, the big department store in Oxford Circus.
- Get out!
- How does the next bit start?
- Buzz off, this ain't no reading circle.
- Get on with it, then.
There's Tattoo Jack and his gang and they're going to break in, eight o'clock tomorrow night.
Thanks to Norman, we've got half a day's start to plan.
They won't get a dekko at this until tomorrow morning.
Boxing.
"It was apparent to Smiler
"that he had been... misled
"for... the newcomer... was... Tattoo Jack!"
Right.
That's all we want to know.
Tattoo Jack is doing the job this week.
Working tonight, dear?
- No, not me. Tattoo Jack.
- Good, we can go to the pictures.
OK, boys.
We're running tonight.
- Why? Who's doing the job?
- Tattoo Jack.
Must be something special.
Detective Sergeant Fothergill.
Who?
I see.
Carry on.
Maclean.
This evening?
Do you mean Ritchie's at Oxford Circus?
Yes.
Yes, thanks for the tip.
We'll follow that up.
- Wallis, Meadows.
- Sergeant?
Anonymous tip-off, for what it's worth.
- Possible job at Ritchie's.
- Do you want us to go?
Yes, I'll come with you.
Eight o'clock.
- Any idea who?
- Bunch of kids, so the nark said.
- Detective Sergeant Fothergill.
- OK, sir.
'Six stone, two pounds.'
'17 stone, 4 pounds.'
'30 stone, 5 pounds.'
'40 stone.'
'40 stone.'
'40 stone.'
'40...stone.'
'...40...stone.'
- Come 'ere!
- Dicky, help me!
I've got him!
Oi! Come on!
Keep hold of him!
In here!
'Ere, get off me!
Get him, Joe!
Let me go! Ow!
Lay off! Stop it!
Get hold of him!
That net there! Come on.
Joe, get him on the floor.
Oi, get down!
Let me out of here, please!
Help, help!
Help!
- What's up?
- Kids!
Big kids, little kids, tough kids, thousands of them all over the place!
- Let me go!
- Hey!
What's going on here?
Here y'are, we caught the lot.
- Phillips!
- Sergeant Fothergill!
Don't stand there gaping, man!
Get us out of this!
Beat it, beat it!
Beat it, out that way!
Come here!
- Right, Sergeant.
- We've got them trapped!
For Pete's sake, get me out of this!
We're done for.
Oi, come 'ere, quick!
- Give us help. Anybody got a torch?
- I've got one, Roy.
Last one put the lid back.
Get down there before the cops come!
- Come on!
- Get down there!
- Coo, don't it pong.
- What do you expect in a sewer? Violets?
This is where my dad works.
Where do we go from here?
Where do you want to go?
Piccadilly? Strand?
They run just like the streets.
Well, come on.
They can't have got out this way.
They must be somewhere.
Might have doubled back inside, sir.
Take a look round the basement.
I'll try the furnace room.
Get on the blower and warn the patrol oar to keep a lookout.
You come with me.
- Here it is!
- Hurray!
Good old Roy!
- What's up?
- It's stiff.
It's no use.
We'd better find another one.
It's all right, Alec.
We'll get out, won't we Joe?
What?
Oh, sure.
Come on.
I can't go on, I can't go on, I can't!
- It won't be for long, Alec.
- I can't!
I can't, I can't!
I can't, I can't!
Shut up, all of you!
- Let's have a go at it.
- It's no use.
'FY calling 12A.
'Oxford Circus, vicinity of Ritchie's.
'Number of boys seen '
Cor, fresh air.
My mum didn't half go off the deep end.
I told my old man I rescued a kid from the canal.
- Did he believe you?
- Dunno. He clouted me.
They can't send me to borstal,
I'm too young.
Oh, shut up. Nobody is going to borstal.
Break into a West End store, beat up the watchman, tie down the cops and expect to get away with it?
- Don't make me laugh.
- How're they going to know?
Don't take any notice, Joe.
Them coppers wasn't after us, they was after the crooks.
- Then why didn't the crooks turn up?
- Joe!
Joe!
There's a couple of coppers standing round by the ruins.
I did, I see 'em!
What did I tell you?
Come on, I'm getting out of here quick.
Where's that water?
- You going, Roy? Where you going?
- Any place'd be healthier than here.
- Why don't they come here and get us, eh?
- Figure that out for yourself.
That Camberwell pal of yours is a nark.
- He knows about the ruins, don't he?
- The dirty little rat.
- What are we going to do?
- What are we going to do?
If we could find them crooks...
Or maybe we ought to go to the police.
Shove it down there, Dicky.
- Out of the way.
- Who you shoving?
Take your fancy ideas somewhere else.
Hit him!
Come on, Joe!
Hit him, Joe!
Dicky, you bring that bowl back, this minute.
Go on, bash him, bash him!
Blimey, look who's here!
Norman the nark!
Joe!
Hey, fellers, turn it up!
Joe!
- Norman! What's up?
- I've got a clue. I've seen Wilkinson.
- You have?
- Yeah.
- My boss wanted the story early.
- Did you get it?
- Lap it up.
- No.
Wilkinson says he posted it last night, he always puts it in the post on Sundays.
- So what?
- We don't ever get it before Tuesday.
- Are you sure of that, Norman?
- Course.
Miss Davis opens it and I take it to the old man.
- Miss Davis. Does she open all letters?
- Yes, but she's all right.
- Not so fast...
- It can't be her.
- Is she good-looking?
- She's a smasher.
'Ere, come off it.
What's the idea?
- I swear...
- How do you reckon she works it?
Supposing she puts the story in her pocket first thing Monday.
She can take it home, muck it about and send it back by last post.
I'll bet ya that's it!
- That dirty, double crossing...
- Now we've got to get some evidence.
He's off again.
It's our big chance, Alec.
If we can find them crooks, we don't have to worry.
- Where does this bird live, Norman?
- Hampstead way somewhere.
- I'll try and find out.
- Might make her suspicious.
- We'll trail her.
- Six o'clock tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- Biggest load of bull I've ever heard.
Poor old Roy.
He don't finish work until seven.
- Coming on my bus, Miss Davis?
- Yes, Norman, I am tonight.
Hurry along, hurry along, please!
One more only.
Oh no, you go, Norman.
You've got further to go than me.
- What did you do that for?
- Where's she gone?
- We've lost her now.
- I couldn't help it.
- That's a fine thing!
- Let's get off.
It's no use yelping, get off quick.
- Look out!
- Watch out!
Across the road, fellers, hurry up!
There she is.
Taxi!
Taxi! Taxi, oi!
Taxi!
Hey, taxi!
Hey, taxi!
Taxi!
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
Taxi!
That's torn it.
- No it hasn't, we'll take a bus.
- Where to, you silly little shrimp?
Number 31, Moyne Road.
That's where the lady told the driver.
I was holding the taxi door.
Cor!
Good old Alec!
Come on!
Shh!
Go on, Alec.
What do you want here?
Can you spare something for the choir outing?
What choir?
St Mark's, Miss.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
I don't know.
I expect you've seen me in church.
Ah yes, that must be it.
Come along in, clear. I'll get my bag.
I want to tell you about the outing.
- You shall. Come along.
- No, I'll stop here.
Oh no you won't.
This was the one they use.
- We've got her.
- Look out!
I get it.
I thought as much.
We'll see what the police have to say.
- Good old Dicky!
- Round the chair, Dicky!
I'll break your necks!
Lay off, will you? Cut it out!
You'll get five years and the cat!
Take your filthy paws off me.
Well, what happens now?
What now, Joe?
Don't you think you're going to get away with this.
What's happened?
We've tied her up.
What?
Here, quick. Have a look at this.
Was them stories done on the same machine?
I don't know.
Supposing she's seen me with you.
- What am I going to say to her?
- She won't be there.
- You can talk, I've got a job to lose.
- What's that bird's name?
Her? Rhona Davis.
Why is this addressed to
Miss Rhona Watson?
Why don't she use her right name at your office?
I'm going to ring my boss and tell him we're really on to something.
- That's right, come on!
- Dicky, Alec, watch her, make her talk!
You get back on guard!
Do we go back in there?
You heard what he said.
We've got to make her talk.
Couldn't we tickle her?
Don't talk silly.
But it worked fine in "The Case Of
The Cross-Eyed Chinaman".
No guv, I'm in a call box.
Speedwell 9446, it's about two minutes from her place.
I'm going to ring up Inspector Ford.
Stop where you are and I'll call you back.
They'll be OK. You stick where you are and don't leave that box.
Good lad.
Hello.
Hello, Exchange.
Hello?
You're going to talk if I stay here all night!
Who's your boss?
I'll scar you for life!
Oh, why don't you go home to Mother?
And you too, you silly little squirt.
I don't know, it made Old Ming Po talk all right.
Go off to your pals.
They knew what was good for them.
They left you to carry the can.
I wouldn't like to be in your shoes when my pals turn up.
Alec, come here.
They won't be long now,
I'm expecting them any minute.
Water torture.
Then you'll know what it means to be tough.
Get it away!
- Stop it.
- Take it away!
- Do you want to talk?
- Yes, yes!
- OK, who runs your racket?
- It's...
Donald Duck.
- You there, undo those cords.
- Yes, sir.
Get a move on.
Hurry, hurry, come on.
Got him!
- Joe, Joe!
- What's happened?
- A bloke turned up.
- One of the crooks.
I knocked him cold.
Dicky's tied him up.
Lovely grub. That'll show Ford.
- Nightingale is trying to contact him.
- We're not going to wait now, are we?
Well, I don't know
He told me not to move.
You gave him the address, he'll find his way all right, come on!
Look!
Oh, they've got Dicky!
We'll never see him again,
I know we won't.
He might have run for it.
We never ought to have left him.
They'll find him in the river.
Nark it, can't ya?
Get a move on!
Who's going to tell her?
Joe, I suppose.
You don't think it's a woman's job?
- She don't like me.
- She hates me.
Hey, Joe!
Dicky!
I got in the back of their car!
They're packing up, getting all their stuff out of London.
- We thought you were dead.
- Pipe down.
King's Cross, that's where they went.
The bloke I tied up's gone to Glasgow.
Where've they got the stuff?
I know where they're shifting it.
Ballard's Wharf.
Cor, if you'd have seen me crouching there beside them...
Here, what's all this?
I might have known it.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself hanging round the streets!
Grr, the old mare!
Don't bother about her.
Ballard's Wharf.
How many crooks' names do you remember out of the "Trump"?
Forget the "Trump".
- What's Ford going to do?
- I've got a big idea.
- Again?
- Give him a chance, Norman.
Larry the Bull and Slimy Sam.
Holy Noakes and Chopper Wilson that used to bump off blondes.
Come on, Norman.
Poplar Pete.
He tried to chuck Selwyn Pike into a bath of acid.
What is this idea?
Benjamin Cutler, Eddie The Moose and Smoky Andrews.
He tried to plug Smiley with a poisoned dart in "Death Comes At Midnight".
Smoky Andrews.
Ford will have to believe us if we round up this lot.
Us round 'em up?
Us and a lot of others.
Listen, the heads know the game's up, see.
But the other blokes don't.
They'll be looking in their "Trump" next week.
For their orders.
That's it.
Listen, could you pinch Wilkinson's story out of the post tomorrow?
- Same as Rhona used to?
- I suppose I can, but...
You've got nothing to worry about.
There'll be another story along at your office.
- Are you going to write it?
- Me?
No.
No, I won't do it.
It's asking too much.
I won't even consider it.
Then I'll have to let them crooks know you put us on to their code.
- This is blackmail.
- That's right.
But if you write the story the way
I've asked, no one would even know.
Such base ingratitude.
Larry the Bull, Slimy Sam, Chopper
Do you want them all included?
Yes, and don't forget the password,
"Seagull".
- When do you want this done?
- First thing.
I've never written a story of this length in under two days!
You'll have to bust your record.
Remember what happened to Nicky the Nark.
It'll mean missing all my sleep.
But all of it.
Oh, howl loathe adventurous-minded boys.
Guvnor, what happened?
Did he create? There was a bloke, came and rescued 'em. If you'd...
Give us a chance.
Do you mean last night?
Yes. Inspector Ford.
Was he wild when he found them gone?
- He was Joe, pretty wild.
- He's going to be thanking us.
- I think we are on to the boss.
- You're onto the boss of the gang?
I reckon he got the others out.
I don't know 'is name yet, but I've got the number of his car, EMU 20.
Carry on, this is interesting.
I know where he's putting that stuff he pinched.
- How?
- A pal of mine.
- Not bad, eh?
- Very smart.
I don't know if you'll be able to get on to Inspector Ford again.
- He won't believe it?
- After last night, of course.
- He will once we round up the gang.
- What have you got in mind?
The boss is moving his swag to Ballard's Wharf, so we're having a special story in the "Trump", telling the others to pinch it.
And you catch them red-handed?
That's the idea. Making a real big do of it, Saturday afternoon.
- Reckon it'll work?
- I'm sure it'll work.
I'm sure it'll work a treat.
- The Battle of Ballard's Wharf.
- Yeah.
Guv!
Guv'nor!
Guv'nor!
Guv!
"Never had there been such an assembly of desperados
"as met on the Saturday afternoon."
"Thieves, kidnappers, stick-up men, blackmailers, bullies, murderers..."
"...all listened eagerly, their villainous faces aglow,
"as Larry the Bull outlined his evil plan."
"'That kid, Smiler, ' announced Larry with a triumphant grin,
"'has played right into our hands.
He's led us all unwitting to the plunder.
"'Let us hie forthwith to number 401,
Crampton Street..."'
What? Let me see that.
- Why, what's the matter?
- Those little...
That's the code for my place, not Ballard's Wharf. They've found out.
- What?
- Heavens, don't be so dumb.
That I never shifted the stuff to the wharf.
They're sending all our chaps to my warehouse.
- What will you do? What about me?
- Oh.
Working overtime eh, Joe?
Where are the others?
Your pals.
No use you holding out.
I've just been reading my "Trump".
Where are they, Joe?
Ballard's Wharf.
Now, now. What's the good of you telling me lies?
I know you've changed the story.
They're at Ballard's Wharf.
- For the last time...
- I'm telling you, at Ballard's Wharf.
To catch them with the stuff, we told them to fetch it and take it there.
I see.
Well, I didn't get that far in the story.
So, you and I are all alone, eh?
That's fine.
- You've taken a tip from me, eh?
- I have?
Sure. I put a phony story in the "Trump" to catch you, didn't I?
Sent you to Ritchie's, but you were too smart for me and now I've been too smart for you.
Wise move of mine, getting you working here.
See, Joe, after that business at Jago's,
I had to keep a special eye on you.
Pick up them oranges.
Mustn't have the place looking untidy.
We're expecting visitors.
It's going to be quite an occasion.
Their first meeting with the big shot.
What time are they invited for?
They'll be here any minute now.
I stayed behind to open up.
How were you to account for your presence?
That was the idea of putting a password in the story.
They'd wear me all right once I'd give that.
Yes, of course, the password.
I was forgetting.
What made you pick on that particular word?
Seemed like a good sort of signal.
There's one of our blokes, he can make a noise...
What particular word?
The password.
Cor, blimey, I was forgetting.
You didn't get that far into the story.
Oh! Let me go!
Oh, you're hurting me!
You'll not get it out of me.
You didn't know the password, did you?
- You brute, you!
- Hah!
Who are you?
I'm the boss.
Who are you?
Seagull.
Now that's more like it.
- Young Smiler, eh?
- That's right, mate.
- So he's the boss of this place.
- Seems like it.
I was sent to open up and he copped me.
Tie him and gag him, Larry.
Get on with the loading.
I'll keep watch.
Any sign of danger and I'll stroll by whistling "The Lambeth Walk".
Pass it on to the others.
Operation Seagull.
Operation Seagull.
It's worked, come on!
Yeah, I've just got time.
Come on fellers, it's time!
Come on, get going!
She won't take it, Larry.
What's that?
Kids.
Oh.
Come on!
...and showery in the north of England and Scotland.
Here's a late item of news, just come in.
Urgent, all boys wanting a big adventure, go immediately to Ballard's Wharf, Shadwell...
And make it snappy.
Keep it up, boys!
Keep it up!
Ugh!
Ugh!
Get a load of this!
Get 'em off me!
All of 'em, get 'em off me!
I've got him!
- Bash him!
- Pull his hair!
Kick 'em!
- Oh, you coward!
- Do the lot of 'em!
Stop that van!
Nightingale!
No you don't, my boy.
Come here, my boy!
Oh!
Well done, Joe!
I Oh, for the wings, for the wings of a dove.
In the wilderness, build me a nest.
And remain there forever.
Oh, for a dove
Esta es una historia que corre de boca en boca...
...por las costas de Mèxico.
Nadie se acuerda del año ni del lugar donde ocurriò.
¿Còmo la ves, compadre?
¿No te animas?
Ni modo que echemos al agua las canoas.
Pero es que han pasado 7 dìas; tenemos que comer.
Puede que nos sienten bien unos puños de frijol.
A ti pue' que sì,
¿pero a nosotros?
-¿Còmo està el mar?
-Sigue muy picado.
A ver...
-...si se calma màs tarde.
-Quiera Dios.
¿Cuàntos dìas màs vamos a estar sin bucear?
No te aflijas, mañana irè a bucear.
Y vamos a sacar mucha concha, ya veràs.
Sacaremos hartas.
Y quièn quita...
...y salga tamaña perla.
-Una de las buenas.
-Tamañotas.
¿No?
Pues...
...quièn quita.
Tengo un presentimiento.
¿Què, no hay màs frijoles, Juana?
Esos son los ùltimos que nos quedan.
¡Mi niño!
-Quino, ve por el doctor.
-¿Tù crees que venga?
No, el doctor no vendrà.
Un dìa lo fui a buscar, ni creas que vaya a venir.
Entonces, vamos por èl.
Ve a ver quièn es, Cruz.
Ahorita, Sr.
¡Àndale, àndale, ve!
¡Cruz!
La puerta.
Sì, señor, siempre se me olvida.
Mis perlas.
Mis tesoros, mis perlas.
-¿Què?
-Una señora lo busca.
Sabes que no recibo a nadie a estas horas de la mañana.
Dile que regrese màs tarde.
Pero es que es una Sra. y no entiende de razones.
Es cierto, doctor, no estoy para razones.
Sòlo una mujer bonita puede...
...tener la ocurrencia de venir a interrumpirle...
...el desayuno a un caballero.
Bueno...
...a ver, què tiene.
Saque la lengua.
No es nada de eso, doctor.
Ud. seguramente ha de saber que un hombre de mi posiciòn...
...no puede hacerse cargo de un caso como el suyo.
Ademàs, es peligroso.
No solamente por la ley y por la religiòn sino que...
...tambièn hay que considerar mi ètica profesional...
...como mèdico que soy.
Ademàs...
...estas cosas resultan muy caras.
¿Tiene usted dinero?
Vaya usted a esa direcciòn esta noche a las 9.
Queremos ver al doctor.
El doctor no està.
Lo picò un alacràn y està muy malo.
A lo mejor se me muere m' ijito.
Ya se lo dije, no està el Dr.
Por favor, no sea mala.
-¿Què tiene?
-Fue un alacràn, Srita.
Se nos puede morir.
Los alacranes matan a los niños.
Es cierto.
Los matan.
El doctor sì està y lo sabes muy bien.
¿Traen dinero?
¿Què demonios pasa ahora?
Ya ni puede uno desayunar en paz.
Ahì estàn dos indios con su chamaquito.
Dicen que lo picò un alacràn.
¡Basta!
Ya nada màs me falta que me traigan puros animales.
¿Què se estàn creyendo?
¿Que soy veterinario?
¿A quièn tengo que curar, al indio o al alacràn?
Esa gente se cree que voy a desperdiciar...
...mi tiempo con sus achaques.
¡Nunca pagan!
No saben lo que cuesta la carrera de mèdico.
Me dieron esto.
Estos indios no tienen dinero.
Nunca en su vida...
...van a tener un centavo.
El doctor no està.
Pero mi chamaco està muy malo.
¿Cuàndo va a estar el doctor?
No va a estar.
¿Ven? Ya se le quitò el dolor.
¿No vienes, Quino?
¿Ya bajò la marea?
Sì, todos los demàs ya van a salir.
No, no podemos.
Vàyanse, yo me quedo con Juanito.
-¿Seguro no lo deja?
-Ni un ratito...
...siquiera, vayan sin pendiente que de aquì no me muevo.
Vàyanse, vàyanse.
Ya sùbete.
-No, me voy pa' abajo otra vez.
-¿Pues què pasa?
No sè decirte.
-Àbrela.
-No me atrevo.
No tengas miedo.
Àbrela.
-¿Ya oìste lo de la perla?
-Ya me dijeron, què suerte.
Te juro por la virgen que es asì de grande.
Doctor, ese indio que trajo a su chamaco enfermo...
...esta mañana acaba de encontrar una perla muy grande.
Es cierto que es una perla extraordinaria.
He hablado con 5 gentes que han visto esa...
...perla, todos dicen que su brillo es perfecto y su forma...
...impecable. Hay que tomarlo por cierto, patròn.
Levàntala, Quino, no la he visto todavìa.
Nuestra suerte ha cambiado,
¿verdad?
¿Què piensas hacer ahora que ya eres rico?
Puede que me compre una pistola.
-Me voy a comprar un rifle.
-Va a tener un rifle.
¿Y què màs vas a tener?
Al cabo eres rico.
Tendremos ropa nueva.
Y ella...
-...tendrà sus zapatos.
-Va a tener zapatos.
Mi hijo sabrà leer...
...y sabrà...
...Io que es un libro.
Y mi hijo aprenderà a escribir.
Y sabrà lo que son las palabras escritas.
Mi hijo aprenderà a hacer nùmeros...
...y sabrà lo que son los nùmeros.
Esas cosas nos haràn libres.
Èl tendrà saber y por èl, nosotros...
...tambièn llegaremos a saber.
Esto es lo que harà la perla.
La perla nos harà libres.

Parece un almirantito.
-¿Què es un almirantito?
-Un gran hombre de mar.
Un pescador.
¡Èchele sinfonìa pa' que se oiga màs bonito!
Las perlas te dan riqueza, dicen que tambièn pesar.
Son làgrimas de tristeza que vienen tambièn del mar...
Bailemos todos contentos con la mùsica del mar...
...con la canciòn de este viejo...
...y el arrullo del palmar...
Aquì està su guayaberita...
...su pantaloncito veteado, mire nomàs què bonitos.
Su corbatita con la bandera tricolor.
Sus zapatitos y unas medias, todo eso pa'el niño.
Esas cosas no son pa' nosotros.
¿No te has dado cuenta que eres rico?
-Còmo no. Tòmalas.
-Cògelas.
Y su dulcecito pa' que no...
Ilore la criatura. Àndele.
Y su ahorcadito pa' que juegue.

¿Dònde està el niño enfermo?
¿Dònde està el niño enfermo?
Soy su mèdico, ya saben.
Yo soy su mèdico.
Mire nomàs què enfermo està.
Si ni està enfermo, ya se aliviò, ella lo curò.
Con piel de vìbora, por supuesto.
Es mèdico, ha de saber que el cuero de culebra...
...se usa pa' la reuma.
He estado ausente, acabo de saber lo del niño.
Tratàndose de un piquete de alacràn es el de mayor peligro.
¿No puede usted hacer nada?
Creo que he llegado a tiempo.
Ese niño està bueno y sano.
No te asustes, Quino.
Ahora pòntelo en el corazòn.
Tengo que decirte algo a solas.
Mira, mi amigo...
Mira, mi amigo...
...tu hijo no tiene nada...
...vine a decirte que...
...que te cuides...
...de estos hombres.
Te quieren robar...
...Ia perla.
Mira...
...yo...
...tambièn tengo perlas.
Dèjame ver la tuya.
Dèjame tocarla.
Nada màs... tocarla.
Por favor.
No la andes cargando.
Escòndela.
Te la van a robar.
Àndale, tòmalo.
Todos los hombres dejan a sus mujeres en la casa.
...y eso demuestra que la mujer es buena, àndale.
Tienes una buena esposa, ni te preocupes por ella.
Àndale, tòmale.
Ella no querìa que la dejara sola.
Salud.
Salud.
Àndale, tòmate la otra.
Nunca nos hemos separado.
Las cosas han cambiado.
Ya eres rico...
...tienes que portarte como los ricos.
Còmo no, hombre, vente.
Àndale.
Yo...
...soy un hombre rico.
-Por el rico.
-Por el nuevo rico.
Tengo...
-...Ia mejor esposa.
-Por la mejor esposa.
Por la mejor esposa.
Mi hijo...
...va a leer...
...va a leer...
-...todos los libros del mundo.
-Por tu hijo.
Por tu hijo, el sabio.

¡Le rompo to' el hocico al Popocatèpetl!
¿Què te pasa?
Les pegaste a tus mejores amigos, por poco y matas a...

¿Estàs loco o se te metiò el diablo?
Perdòname.
Perdòname, por favor.
Te perdono, mi hermano, esta noche ha sido pa' divertirnos.

¿Dònde, dònde?
¿Dònde?
¿Dònde?
Debajo...
...de mi Virgencita.
Ella...
...Ia va a cuidar.
No està aquì, nos engañò otra vez.
¡Juana!
-Perdì nuestra perla.
-No, Quino.
Yo la tengo.
Cuando gente como èsa se vuelve rica...
...sòlo Dios sabe adònde vamos a parar.
¿Me entendieron bien?
No quiero ninguna equivocaciòn.
Con permiso, patròn.
-¿Què pasò con Uds.?
-No tuvimos la culpa...
...todo saliò al revès.
Pa' acabarla de amolar su hermano...
...el Dr. nos vino a estorbar.
Pero no se llevò la perla,
¿verdad?
No, no se la llevò.
Esa perla tiene que ser mìa.
Y si no me quedo con ella, ya saben què tienen que hacer.
-Làrguense.
-Sì, patròn.
-¿Què se les ofrece?
-Tengo una perla.
Hay mucha gente que tiene perlas.
Pero mi perla es muy buena.
Ya la està sacando, se la va a enseñar.
Lo siento, mi amigo.
Es una perla...
...que vale mucho.
Sì, vale mucho.
Ustedes sin duda han oìdo hablar..
...del oropel.
Pues bien...
...esta perla...
...es como el oropel.
Parece buena...
...pero no vale nada.
Es la mejor perla del mundo...
...nunca se ha visto una perla igual.
Nunca se ha visto una deformidad igual.
Grande y deforme, quizà algùn museo se interese...
...en comprarla para su colecciòn de conchas.
No sirve para otra cosa.
Yo soy tu amigo.
Y te voy a dar...
...nueve veces mas...
...de lo que vale.
Te voy a dar novecientos pesos.
Novecientos pesos, es mucho dinero.
No sè.
Mi perla vale 50 veces màs que los 900 pesos.
Soy el hombre màs honrado y cabal que has conocido...
...serìa incapaz de pagarte un precio que no fuera justo.
Nuestras perlas nunca son buenas...
...pa' usted.
Mira...
...yo sòlo soy valuador.
Si no me crees...
...ve y busca otro, ve a verlo.
O mejor todavìa, que vengan ellos para que te des...
...cuenta de que no nos hemos puesto de acuerdo.
Està bien, que vengan.
¡Le hablan al otro comprador!
Le he puesto precio a esta perla...
...pero el dueño no està conforme.
Les voy a suplicar que la examinen...
...y que le hagan la mejor oferta.
Fìjate bien que no he mencionado lo que te ofrecì.
A mì no me incluyan en su discusiòn...
...ni siquiera me interesa.
Esto no es una perla, es un fenòmeno.
Es horrible, parece una càscara de huevo.
Mira, mira.
Tengo un cliente a quien le gustan...
...Ias cosas raras como èsta.
Le ofrezco...
...quinientos pesos...
...con la esperanza de vendèrsela a mi cliente en 600.
Di que voy a meter la pata pero por ser mi amigo...
...te ofrezco mil pesos.
¿A dònde vas?
¿Què le vas a aconsejar?
No sè...
...pero yo creo que mi compadre deberìa de irse...
...pero tambièn deberìa quedarse.
No sè si deba vender esa perla o no venderla.
No sè què aconsejarle.
Tal vez ha pecado en secreto.
Su pecado fue haber encontrado esa perla.
Pero eso no es un pecado, fue una casualidad.
Dios sabrà.
¡Compadre! ¡Compadre!
¡Estàn matando a Quino!
-¿Què pasò, comadre?
-Querìan matarlo.
¿Quiènes fueron, compadre?
No sè.
Vàmonos, compadre, tenemos que hablar tù y yo.
Antes no sabìa yo còmo aconsejarte...
...pero ahora ya lo sè:
Tienes que venderles la perla por lo que te den...
...porque de lo contrario, tienes que irte de aquì.
Ahora ya sabes que no puedes vivir en paz.
Tienes que irte, compadre.
Porque si no, te van a matar.
Èste es mi consejo de amigo.
Gracias, compadre.
Pero no sè què hacer.
Yo no me quiero ir de aquì.
Tengo que pensarlo.
Tal vez mañana sabrè lo que tengo que hacer.
Està bien, compadre...
Buenas noches.
Buenas noches, comadre.
Buenas noches, compadre.
Quino...
...yo he sido siempre una buena esposa para ti.
¿Verdad?
Sì, Juana.
Entonces...
...por primera vez te voy a pedir una cosa.
Tira la perla al mar.
Quièbrala entre dos piedras.
Destruye la perla, porque si no...
...ella nos va a destruir a nosotros.
Yo harìa cualquier cosa por ti, Juana.
Pero eso no.
No puedo.
Yo he visto en esa perla...
...una mejor vida para nosotros.
Juanito tiene que aprender a leer...
...tiene que saber lo que es un libro.
En esa perla yo he visto la libertad, Juana.
Y yo he visto la muerte.
La muerte y la soledad.
Tira la perla al mar.
Tìrala por favor, Quino.
He venido a hacerte una visita.
Buenas noches, hermano.
Me has asustado.
Tus nervios...
...tus nervios estàn deshechos.
Deberìas de cuidarte màs.
Pero mucho màs.
Mis nervios estàn perfectamente bien.
Es que estàs pensando todo el tiempo en los demàs.
Y deberìas pensar en ti mismo.
Y en tu salud.
¿A què has venido?
Es una perla...
...pequeña...
...pero muy buena.
Y es... negra.
A veces...
...una perla pequeña...
...es preferible a una perla grande.
Es menos peligrosa, hermano.
Menos peligrosa.
¡Juana!
¿A dònde vas?
Dèjanos solos, Juana.
Aquì hay bastantes tortillas.
Aquì està el agua.
Hay que cuidar mucho el agua, compadre.
¿Podremos regresar algùn dìa?
Puede ser.
Bueno, tenemos que irnos.
Los voy a acompañar hasta la playa.
No, compadre, tù ya no puedes estar con nosotros.
Vàmonos, Juana.
Adiòs, comadre, adiòs, compadre.
Adiòs, comadre.
Una mujer y un hombre.
Y un perro.
Y un hombre con zapatos.
El perro y el hombre con zapatos se fueron por allà...
...Ia mujer y el hombre se metieron al agua.
Sigan a la mujer y al hombre.
¡Quino!
-El hombre y la mujer.
-¿Cuànto tiempo hace?
-Antes de caer el rocìo.
-Harà...
...dos horas.
Sìganlos.
¿Què es?
No sè.
-¿Què pasa?
-Ya no va la mujer.
Miren de nuevo.
No va la mujer.
Puede que la lleve cargando.
No estàn muy lejos.
Apùrense antes que se haga noche.
Vamos, apùrense.
-¿Quiènes son?
-Vamos, no podemos perder tiempo.
Apùrate, Juana.
Sigue tù, sigue adelante.
Yo ya no tengo fuerzas.
Ya no puedo màs.
No, Juana.
Creo que les hemos ganado terreno.
Descasaremos un ratito...
...y ya veràs còmo te sentiràs mejor.
¡Juana!
¡Juana!
Juana, ¿què haces ahì?
Te digo que te vayas.
Tù y Juanito pueden escaparse solos.
Yo ya no tengo fuerzas.
Y mis pies me estàn sangrando.
Vete, Quino.
-Te digo que ya no puedo màs.
-Sal de ahì, Juana.
No, te digo que te vayas.
Por favor, vete.
¡No! ¡No!
¡No, Quino, por favor, no!
Pobre de ti, Juana.
O yo me quedo contigo...
...o tù vienes conmigo.
Pero no podemos separarnos nunca, Juana.
Tù y yo somos como una sola persona.
¿Quieres que nos maten a todos?
Entonces, quèdate.
Te digo que tù puedes escaparte con Juanito.
Yo ya no puedo seguir porque les dejarìa...
...un rastro de sangre.
Juana...
...hay veces que...
...Ias mujeres se dan por vencidas...
...porque no les queda ninguna esperanza.
Y para esos momentos...
...està el hombre.
Anda, Juana.
Con cuidado.
Estos piecitos...
...estàn lastimados.
Pero tendràs zapatos negros...
...de esos que brillan bonito.
Como los que llevan los ricos a misa.
Yo solìa mirarles los pies a los ricos...
...todos los domingos.
Pero tù tienes los pies...
...màs chiquitos que los de ellos.
No volveràs a pisar la tierra.
Piensa en las cosas tan bonitas que vamos a tener.
Puede que una cama.
Dicen que se descansa tanto...
...en una cama.
Tan blandas y tan blancas...
...y tù acostada en ella.
Muy linda.
Con tu pelo suelto.
Y muy negro sobre lo blanco.
Y Juanito...
...se subirà a la cama con un libro abierto.
Y se pondrà a leer, Juana.
¿Vienes conmigo, Juana?
Eres mi esposo.
Agua, por amor de Dios.
Vayan con Dios.
De aquì no podràn salir.
Entonces, aquì esperaremos.
Se està poniendo frìo, patròn.
¿No quiere que haga lumbre?
Hazla.
¿Què fue eso?
Quièn sabe.
Puede que una lechuza.
Puede que un coyotito.
¿Què vas a hacer?
Tengo que bajar a enfrentàrmeles.
Tengo que bajar antes de que amanezca; de noche...
...ellos tienen menos ventaja.
Es peor... si no me arriesgo.
Adiòs, hijito.
Adiòs, Juana.
Està muy cerca.
Ya matò a su hermano... matò al señor anciano.
...y ahora va a matar a èste.
Nosotros lo vimos.
Yo me voy a ir.
-¿Sin tu paga?
-Sin mi paga pero con mi vida.
Dejaron a Juanito debajo de un montòn de piedras en...
...Ia montaña y regresaron a su hogar.
Dicen los ancianos que caminaban como sonàmbulos...
...al atravesar la aldea.
Y la perla que habìa sido la esperanza y la belleza...
...se convirtiò en fealdad, avaricia...
...muerte y soledad.
Fueron al cantil que se erguìa màs alto sobre el mar...
...para hacer lo que estaban destinados a hacer.
Tù.
No.
Tù.

Company .. halt!
Good morning.
─ Good morning.
Is someone ill?
For the Captain ma'am.
He can't leave the bridge.
Beautiful soup. Tomato soup.
Mrs Sorenson has no life-jacket.
─ Mrs Sorenson has no life-jacket?
Shhh. No life-jacket.
Did you hear that Mr Payton?
Mrs Sorenson has no life-jacket.
─ Who?
Mrs Sorenson.
My dear, haven't you forgotten your life-jacket?
Hardly.
Mrs Sorenson, I think you've forgotten your life-jacket.
Thank you Mr Skold, but I prefer not to wear it.
Captain's orders Mrs Sorenson.
─ Really?
Mr Hansen.
─ Sir?
Put another lookout on the starboard bow.
─ Yes sir.
Ahoy there! Put another lookout to starboard.
Jump to it.
I have to report sir, that Mrs Sorensen refuses to put on her life-jacket.
Make her put it on.
─ I've tried sir, but she won't.
Mr Hansen.
─ Sir?
Ask Mrs Sorensen to see me in my cabin.
─ Yes, sir.
When I saw her come aboard I knew we were in for trouble.
Did you sir?
Not that I don't like them that way.
Not in peacetime, sir.
And ashore.
Come in Mrs Sorenson.
You wanted to see me Captain?
What is your objection to wearing a life-jacket?
Apparently the same as yours.
Mrs Sorenson, have you ever been put in irons?
No.
You will find it much more uncomfortable than wearing a life-jacket.
You can't put me in irons because
I refuse to wear a life-jacket.
You are mistaken Mrs Sorenson.
I am the captain of this ship and you are a passenger.
My job is to give orders, and yours is to obey them.
I am responsible for the safety of every person in my ship and I am determined ..
Take my passengers safely to the port for which they have bought their tickets.
Whether you like it or not!
Steward!
You're not really going to put me in irons?
Sir?
Fetch Mrs Sorenson's life-jacket.
─ Aye aye, sir.
In 48 hours you will be ashore at Copenhagen.
Where you can wear whatever you like.
But while you are on my ship, you will obey my orders.
Sir!
You're wanted on the bridge, sir.
A British patrol boat.
We .. wish .. to .. speak .. with .. you.
We wish to speak with you.
As if we weren't late enough already.
They want to take us into a Control Port and hold us there for days or weeks.
Better than meeting a U-Boat anyway sir.
Oh they say U-Boat Commanders are very polite.
Yes .. afterwards.
She looks pretty fast, sir.
One round, blank .. load.
They are signaling again, sir.
Heave to immediately.
Let them come and get me.
Fire!
Helvig, ahoy!
Tommy, drop the ladder.
Ladder down.
Move out of the way for us.
Hello chief. Have a good trip?
Captain Andersen? I've got a telegram for you from your owners.
I'm Lieutenant-Commander Ellis and this is Lieutenant-Commander Ashton.
I can't say I'm glad to see you, gentlemen.
We brought you some English newspapers Captain.
Thank you. My passengers will find them interesting.
We shall want to see your ship's papers, Captain.
Alright.
Hello chief.
You refused to heave-to Captain.
Any particular reason?
For the reason that I didn't want to lose time with your contraband control.
Radio-log sir, radio-cabin seal, sir.
─ Thank you.
What's your cargo Captain?
Iodine and medical supplies.
Crude medical supplies.
─ Yes, crude medical supplies.
My country has had no shipments since the war.
I can see your point Captain.
─ I wonder if you can.
You see, the unfortunate thing about war is that neutrals sometime have to suffer.
They may be carrying goods for our enemies and we have to see that they don't.
It means inconvenience and delay, but it's better than putting a torpedo into you.
I appreciate that.
Anyway, those are our orders, and we had to stop you.
What would you have done in our place, Captain?
Orders are orders.
What would you have done in my place,
Lieutenant-Commander?
Run away.
Cigar?
─ Do you mind if I stick to my pipe?
Not at all. I'll stick to mine.
Ship's manifest.
─ I'll update that.
Yes, here.
Consigned to the order of the Danish Government.
???? 525 tons, packed in bales.
Yes.
Crude iodine .. 504 tons.
That's a big shipment Captain.
─ The biggest yet.
Uhuh, and very valuable to my country.
Yes, valuable to any country.
???? in bag, 1610 tons.
???? - 268 tons, 28 tons on deck.
Do you know what your cargo's worth, Captain?
Certainly. 40 million kroner.
Yes, about 2 million pounds sterling.
[ door knocks ]
Yes?
Your turn next. He was simply charming.
─ Good.
You are English by birth Mrs Sorenson?
Yes, my husband is Danish and we lived for some time in America.
Is your husband still in America?
No, he lives in Denmark.
I live in America.
You cross the Atlantic very frequently?
─ Yes, I do.
Perhaps you have some business that ..
My husband has the custody of our child.
And I am allowed to visit her at frequent intervals.
I see.
Thank you Mrs Sorenson. Please ask
Miss Karoly to come in now.
Certainly.
You passed Puerto Blanco on the tenth.
Then ???? the twenty-fourth and New York the sixth.
A roundabout route, Captain?
Owner's orders. Had to pick up Red-Cross supplies in New York.
It's marked down Fred. Independent manifest.
32 tons, packed in special cases.
Consigned to Germany.
Under the International Red-Cross agreement.
─ Oh yes, quite.
Engineer's logbook, sir. Lieutenant says, shall he proceed with the search, sir?
Yes please, Tell him "General Examination".
Oh one moment Church.
Captain, as a formality we shall need some hatches opened. Will you give the orders?
Uhuh.
He's alright.
Thank you Mrs Abo, that is all.
─ Thank you.
Rather cute.
─ What?
Mrs Abo.
How do you think she came to marry a professor with a Finnish name?
Oh, I can tell you that sir.
She was his only pupil.
Ha!
There's only one passenger left, sir.
─ Ah, Mr Pidgeon.
Surely, surely your name is English,
Mr Pidgeon?
Correct, I was born in the old country.
And your business takes you abroad?
─ Hmm. On and off.
You are a "talent scout" Mr Pidgeon?
When the mood takes me.
What kind of talent do you
 scout Mr Pidgeon?
Acts ..
Variety acts.
Oh, then have these Hungarian artists been engaged by you?
I'm only interested in the big time.
You travel a great deal to the United States?
I bring the acts over.
Not so easy these days.
Per Ardua Ad Astra.
Thank you Mr Pidgeon.
Okay.
Mr Skold, inform the passengers that while in port they must black out all lights.
Yes sir. Allow me sir.
Commander, do you think we should stay here long?
Can't say.
You see, I have a brother in London, and I'm his favorite brother.
In that case, perhaps our search party will be able to find some contraband.
Oh that would be splendid, sir.
Skipper. You're wanted in the saloon sir.
Do sit down Captain.
─ Thank you.
Well Captain, we've examined the ship's papers, the passengers and your cargo.
The papers are in order and the officers are satisfied with your passengers.
But the cargo is contraband.
But I have here an Admiralty list of ships to be passed through quickly on arrival.
Your ship, Captain, is among them.
It only remains that you satisfy us that your cargo is for your country alone.
How long will that take?
The Ministry Of Economic Warfare will give that answer tonight.
So, there will be nothing to stop you sailing in the morning.
That would be splendid .. steward!
My owners asked me to get in touch with our agent here. Can you help us?
Going to stretch your legs tonight
Captain?
Go ashore?
Yes, I can manage.
How about dinner afterwards?
─ Very good of you.
There's no duty-boat free.
We'll arrange for a local man to take you.
You'll need a couple of Landing Passes.
Gentlemen.
─ Oh very good, very nice.
You understand Captain Andersen, until you get your clearance papers in the morning ..
We shall hold you responsible for the ship and everyone in her.
Perfectly. When will the boat be here?
─ About six.
Four bells.
[ door knocks ]
Come in.
Ready skipper?
Is the motor boat here?
─ Sure, it came half an hour ago.
Then let's go.
─ Oh don't forget the landing-passes.
I thought you had taken them.
─ Me? No ..
They were lying on the desk.
You sure you didn't put them in a drawer?
─ Of course I'm sure.
They can't have flown away.
I saw them lying there, but
I didn't touch them.
You didn't .. but somebody else did.
Anyway, how could we get ashore?
My goodness. I had a boat along to do a paint-job.
Never mind the ship's boat. Go and see if the motor-boat is still there.
The motor-boat? My goodness.
Gone!
I though so .. we'll start with the passengers.
You take the port cabins,
I'll take the starboard.
Yes sir.
Come in.
Hello Captain.
─ I beg your pardon.
Mrs Sorenson?
Mr Pidgeon has flown.
Nowhere on the ship?
─ Nope.
Sure?
─ Yes.
Did you see Mrs Sorenson anywhere?
No.
Mrs Sorenson, and Mr Pidgeon.
Does it make sense to you?
No, during the whole voyage they never once spoke to each other.
I wonder what she tore out of here?
It's the local paper.
If we had another copy we could tell.
Just a minute.
Enter.
May I borrow your newspaper?
Certainly Captain, but you can read it here Captain.
Silly!
Now we shall see.
─ Page twelve.
I've got it.
"If you suffer from indigestion, take Tono's Tonic Powder."
"By Mrs J Wright. I was worn out.
My husband gave me up, my doctor .."
What have you got there?
─ I don't know.
What is it, sir?
Revised timetable of trains to London.
London. I can see the departure for 7:15.
Arrives London Victoria 9:15.
I'll stop them catching that train if
I have to swim ashore.
Mrs Sorenson .. and Mr Pidgeon.
Guard ship.
What will happen when we don't turn up to dinner?
You will turn up, I'm going to the railway station.
What shall I tell of our action to the Commander?
Tell him whatever you like.
Mrs Sorenson .. and Mr Pidgeon.
Come on, Mata Hari, we've got exactly a minute to catch that train.
I know but .. hello?
Hello. Can I speak to Mrs Clayton please?
This is the secretary speaking.
No, Mrs Clayton is not home at the moment.
She's in town, but she's out giving a first-aid lecture. Who is that, please?
This is her niece Miss Clayton.
When will Mrs Clayton be back?
I think about half past ten Miss Clayton.
Will you tell her I will be in London at that time. I will have a friend with me.
Very good.
I don't know you, do I?
No. I've only been with Mrs Clayton for a month.
My name is Lang.
Come on. Yap, yap, yap.
Goodbye.
No. Stay there.
Would you mind shutting that door, sir.
There's a draught.
What's the next stop?
─ London, sir.
Hello Rickman. Back?
No, I'm paddling a canoe up Niagara Falls.
Funny, aren't you. How many ships in the anchorage?
None. All boarders.
Do you want the Ocean Breeze or
Silver Fox for tomorrow morning?
What, those old tubs? No I want
Saucy Sally at six-thirty sharp.
Broken crankshaft.
─ Hell, that's the third time.
I can do My Girl for the six-thirty.
Well, you have got a bunch of old crocks, haven't you.
Any more letters or telegrams?
─ Yes, but wait until I've finished.
Oh, it's seven o'clock now.
Why did Horace ever sell his farm and go to sea?
Never mind, you'll be home by nine, my good man.
You finished the boarding report on the Zandam?
Two minutes.
How'd you expect me to read this?
How do you expect me to do copper-plate with chilblains?
Lieutenant-Commander Ellis?
Straight along the passage, through the swing-doors, turn right.
Well, find anything?
─ Yes, sir.
A lot of stuff that wasn't manifested.
Cases of machinery?
Yes, sir. Looks like parts of an aeroplane.
─ I thought so.
Ge me M.E.W. on the direct line.
Lieutenant-Commander Ellis, sir.
Hello Mr Skold.
─ May I present our agent.
Oh, we know about him.
─ Hello sonny-boy.
Where's the skipper?
He's staying on board, sir.
He's not doing very well.
Why, what's wrong with him?
He looked alright.
He's awfully ill now. He keeps on having attacks. It's stomach ache.
And when he gets stomach aches, he's no good for anything.
He should drink gin.
Waiter, four pink gins.
Can we send out a doctor?
─ No. He hates doctors.
So do I. Only two things worth a twopenny-damn. Gin, and a good circulation.
Which side do we get out, mummy?
─ I don't know dear.
It's this side mummy.
Victoria. Victoria.
Alright governor.
─ Sorry.
The lady has the tickets.
How dare you go ashore! How dare you steal the two landing passes!
How dare you go ashore without landing passes!
Do you know what I could do to you?
For what?
You don't want to be mixed up with the police do you?
No, do you?
─ No, I don't.
Where's Mr Pidgeon?
─ Mr Pidgeon?
I don't know anything about Mr Pidgeon.
I suppose he came to London to engage Variety acts?
That's his business.
What a coincidence that you two stole the same landing passes at the same time.
To use the same motorboat, to travel on the same train.
You don't have to believe it.
I believe that if I stick with you, we shall meet Mr Pidgeon again.
Do you?
─ Yes, I do.
Look. I promise I'll be back on the ship before morning. My word of honor.
To play cards?
So we leave at ten past ten.
─ Or five past twelve.
And if we don't find Mr Pidgeon by 3:30 we all go to jail.
And no doubt, we shall find him there.
Meanwhile, where you go, I go.
Well, it was worth trying.
Gas-mask cases! Torches! Gas-mask cases!
Don't forget the torches.
Don't forget your torches.
Don't forget your gas-mask cases.
Torches! Gas-mask cases. Here, a nice torch for the blackout.
A ever-lasting battery and a beam as strong as a searchlight.
If you buy one of these, you will never lose your way.
I don't want a torch!
─ But it will guide your way home, sir.
It will guide the young lady home as well, sir.
Only half-a-dollar, sir.
─ I'll buy a torch.
Thank you lady .. see that beam!
Thank you.
─ Thank you, lady.
What about a nice-looking gas-mask case Miss?
Handy for putting sandwiches in.
I need another torch, for the gentleman.
─ I don't need a torch.
Everybody needs a torch in the blackout.
Thank you.
Thank you lady.
Shine your torch!
Oh, many times I've stood on my bridge in the Atlantic on a night like this.
Oh, I beg your pardon!
─ Hey, look where you're going!
Obviously you're better in the middle of the Atlantic. Now will you shine your torch?
This is Buckingham Palace Road.
─ You really know where we are?
Of course.
─ Amazing.
But I wouldn't be much use in the middle of the Atlantic.
"Will that gentleman shine his torch down please."
A police car.
─ Oh.
Coming?
Where are we going?
─ To the bus-stop.
Wait a minute. Are we going by bus?
─ I'm going by bus.
Hyde Park Corner, Ritz Hotel, Bond Street and Oxford Circus.
Hold tight!
I beg your pardon.
Fares please .. fares please.
Any more fares please .. fares please.
Fare please!
A threepenny and a a penny one please.
Thank you. Any more fares please?
The penny one is for you.
You think you're very clever don't you.
How do expect to get about London in the blackout without any money?
I can get all the money I need.
And I'll buy you such a dinner as you've never had in your life.
Big words.
─ Big dinner.
Are you hungry?
As a matter of fact, I'm starving.
Well, let's take a taxi.
Alright. But I'm not paying for it.
Hyde Park Corner ..
Taxi .. yes .. taxi.
Stick to it.
Taxi!
Here's one .. taxi.
Go home crackers.
Taxi!
Here's one .. you see?
Can we give you a lift .. or something?
─ No!
You'd better take a taxi.
Taxi!
Cab! Cab!
It's a Hansome. Cabby ..
Where to?
─ The Three Kings.
The three what?
─ Three Kings.
The Three Vikings.
Oh, the Danish place? Albany Street?
Okay, come on me old boy.
Three Vikings ..
Good evening.
─ Good evening.
No gas-masks?
─ We have no gas-masks.
Two sir?
─ Yes, two.
Haven't you got a table by the wall?
─ I'm so sorry sir. They are all taken.
We should like to talk to the proprietor.
─ Yes, sir.
He's bound to know what is good in his own restaurant. Isn't he?
Order! Order! I must have order in my kitchen!
Mr Skold, f you please.
─ What is it?
A customer wishes to speak to you Mr Skold.
OH what is wrong again?
What is wrong again?
Don't you know by now that I hate to be disturbed. Tell him to go to hell.
But be polite. Polite!
Stir for two minutes, add cream, don't stir, serve.
Uncle Erik, you're wanted on the telephone. It's urgent.
Oh, are you also an idiot? I thought at least my kitchen was clean of idiots.
Don't you see I have no time.
I must not be disturbed in my kitchen, and now I am disturbed. Once is enough.
Tell the silly fool to ring tonight after midnight. But be polite. Very polite.
But it is urgent Uncle Erik.
Oh ..
Uncle Erik .. please!
Good evening.
─ Good evening Mr Skold.
This is Mr Skold, proprietor of the Three Vikings.
I am Captain Andersen of the Helvig.
This is Mrs Sorenson.
Mrs Sorenson is a passenger on my ship.
Good evening.
─ Good evening.
What a surprise Captain, and what a pleasure, a very great pleasure.
I hope nothing has happened to the Helvig.
Oh no .. and your brother sends you his love.
My brother? Now you must tell me everything please.
What is it? Why don't you take the order?
You must have a drink with me.
Oh, would you like to come and see my cold tables?
Certainly!
─ Come.
Now you must have some of this, and some of that. That is wonderful.
By the way, Mr Skold, I came ashore in such a hurry I have no money.
No money?
So .. you are Captain Andersen in the ship where my brother is a cook?
Cook?
─ Or is he something else?
Of course he's something else.
─ Ah, but what?
Why, First Officer.
─ Ah, please, excuse.
But the Helvig must be since eight days in Copenhagen?
But she's not.
─ Where is she, if she's not?
That's a secret, and it's also a secret that I'm here in London.
Ah, so. It is a secret. Of course,
I don't mention it.
Is it also a secret why my brother did not come to see me? My favorite brother?
Is it also a secret why he did not wire, why he did not write?
How could he write, if we only arrived this afternoon ..
No trouble.
─ Uncle Erik.
Go away! What are you doing in the restaurant?
So, he could not wire, he could not write and he could not come.
Why could he not come when a passenger could come?
Because I am the Captain and I have forbidden him to come.
And you expect favors of me when you forbid my brother to come and see me?
Excuse me Mr Skold, I couldn't help hearing.
I paid the gent's cab fare.
Three bob and a tanner.
Damn your bobs and tanners! There is more important business here to be discussed.
Well, I couldn't help hearing.
Please Uncle Erik.
Now look here Mr Skold.
You seem to doubt my word.
I do now seem, and I do doubt!
And why should I believe you?
Mr Skold, the gentleman on the telephone is a tall call.
If he speaks from America, let him.
I should care?
But it is your brother Mr Skold!
Your brother Axel, Mr Skold.
Axel? Why the?
I told you it was urgent Mr Skold.
Where is the phone?
Hello? Hello? Hello Axel?
It's me, Andersen.
Here in London. Yes, he's here.
Oh yes, I like it very much.
Listen, Axel, did you leave the boat tied up?
Good .. yes I had to follow them.
No, Pidgeon is missing, but I've got her.
She's sitting in the restaurant and she ..
Speak to your brother.
─ Erik, Erik, Erik!
Oh Axel, I am so glad to hear your voice my boy.
Your Captain? Yes, he is a beautiful man.
From the first moment, I liked him.
The lady asked if the gentleman is going.
What lady?
─ Please.
Thank you.
Bon!
Now. What will you have to follow?
─ We haven't ordered yet.
Not ordered. Not ordered?
???? and tomato sauce.
Which do you suggest?
This,and this and that, are all ready, but that, that is wonderful.
But then I usually prepare that myself and I would have to leave you.
Oh pity.
─ We should love to taste it.
Well don't worry, don't worry.
You shall see, in fifteen minutes.
Follow me.
How is Axel the Mate?
He seemed to have dined well.
─ Not so well as us.
He has a clear conscience.
─ No he hasn't.
Why?
He has to cover my absence.
─ I've put you both on the spot.
I like being on the spot. Skol!
─ Skol!
What else do you like?
─ A small ship.
I suppose you've never tried a big ship?
The bigger the ship, the smaller the adventure.
The smaller the ship, the bigger the adventure, but you wouldn't understand.
Because you have childish ideas about life.
Because like so many women you live only for little excitements, like uh ..
Like what?
Well, like going out every night, somewhere new, somebody new. Right?
You didn't answer my question.
Did you ever try a big ship?
Of course I did.
And did you ever try being married?
That can be quite a big adventure.
─ Ah, why do women always say that?
Marriage ends adventure.
Why do men always say that?
Hmm! .. Skol!
Skol!
Well, in five minutes our first train is leaving.
Show me.
Commandante Andersen.
─ Yes.
In the Danish Navy.
─ Uhuh. In the Danish Navy.
But you left it. Why?
The Danish Navy sails around the coast of Denmark and then back again.
I wanted to sail everywhere a ship can sail.
But you wouldn't understand that.
The "Bjorn Helm" was a big ship?
─ Hmm.
Six times as big as the Helvig.
That's the winder.
Press it again.
[ musical chimes ]
It's fascinating.
That's the song we officers used to sing when we went ashore.
The last part especially.
Twice?
─ Twice.
Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah.
Let me try.
Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah.
Now I've got it.
Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah. Skol!
Skol!
[ train whistle ]
Close your eyes when you get outside and count to ten.
The you will be able to see better in the blackout.
Thank you Mr Skold, you think of everything.
Oh it is nothing, nothing at all. And whenever you come the restaurant is yours.
Goodbye.
─ Goodbye.
Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah.
Can you see any better?
─ Just as black as it was.
Blacker.
What are you going to do until five past twelve?
I've got a lot to do.
─ We've have a lot to do.
We have lot to do.
─ What do we do first?
Have a drink?
─ Good.
And the drinks are on me.
─ Good.
Here's your taxi, sir.
And I'll pay for the taxi.
Where are we now?
─ Chester Square
Is it?
─ Look up.
I've never seen the stars so clear in a big city.
Don't look so high. See that window?
I spent eight years of my life there.
Is anyone at home? Aunt Kate?
This is my aunt's house.
I think you'll like her.
Aunt Kate!
[ do barking ]
It's the boys. They must be in the kitchen.
Come on boy .. come on.
Come to me, then. It doesn't look as if your aunt is at home.
She must be upstairs. Aunt Kate!
Aunt Kate!
At least the secretary ought to be here.
Aunt Kate.
Aunt Kate!
Aunt Kate.
Are you sure you have an aunt, and not an uncle?
Good evening.
Good evening Mrs Sorenson.
─ I'm Miss Clayton.
You've never heard the name Sorenson?
─ Never in my life.
This is my aunt's house. Who are you?
─ My name is Lang.
You're the secretary. Where is Mrs Clayton?
Sergeant Clayton. Somewhere in
England I believe.
Don't let us waste time Mrs Sorenson.
─ I tell you I am not Mrs Sorenson.
And you, I suppose, are not Mr Pidgeon?
Uh, I'm not Mr Pidgeon.
Sloan 2-7-4-1.
─ I want to speak to Mrs Sorenson.
What name please?
─ Tell her it's Mr Pidgeon. It's urgent.
She's in the bathroom sir.
Can she ring you back?
Ring me back? What the devil for?
She was supposed to be here long ago.
Tell her to hurry.
Where should she ring you sir if she asks?
─ She knows.
Where should she meet you, sir?
─ She knows.
Hello? Hello, hello.
Have you finished?
─ Who is that?
This is the Army And Navy Club, madam.
So Mr Pidgeon is at the
Army And Navy Club.
The Army And Navy Club?
Then who are you?
My name is Andersen.
Hans Andersen.
And we are the Brothers Grimm.
Are they Police?
─ I wish they were.
No talking!
What are you looking at?
─ The stars.
Get out.
Suppose we don't get out?
Yes. As a matter of fact, we feel quite comfortable where we are.
Yes! We are just beginning to like it very much.
Get out and stop talking.
─ Who is going to stop me talking?
We are in a free country where you can say what we like and do what we like.
We choose to sit here and talk as loud as we like, and if we want to, we shall sing!
As a matter of fact we do want to sing, don't we?
Yes, we do.
Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah.
Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah.
"You, I suppose, are not Mr Pidgeon?"
"Not Mr Pidgeon. Not Mr Pidgeon.
Not Mr Pidgeon Not Mr Pidgeon!"
"Not Mr Pidgeon."
"Not .. Mr .. Pidgeon ..
Not .. Mr .. Pidgeon."
"Not .. Mr .. Pidgeon.
Not .. Mr .. Pidgeon."
Not .. Mr .. Pidgeon.
No. He's certainly not Mr Pidgeon.
Conrad Andersen.
Looks genuine.
Yes, Herr Van Dyne.
That's more than can be said for, you isn't it, Mrs Sorenson?
Oh, I was forgetting.
Your name is not Sorenson.
─ And yours is not Van Dyne.
You are not Danish.
─ And you are not English.
We met once before. You remember?
Who can forget those hands, that face, that voice?
That whole striking appearance.
─ And my powers of imagination.
Don't forget that.
─ I don't.
No-one knew better how to make prisoners talk.
Then I don't have to warn you.
But I do have to warn you.
No, no, no. It's no good trying to bluff me, Miss Clayton.
You said that once before in Düsseldorf.
Next day, I crossed the Dutch frontier.
Ah yes, but this time you haven't got Mr Pidgeon to help you.
You said that before too.
Well, we shall see when we bring him here.
From the Army And Navy Club.
Oh, I remember.
You said you wanted to know how
I should look ..
.. tied hand and foot, knowing that the next day I would face a firing squad.
I should still be interested to know.
─ Oh, you think I'm a coward?
Well, would a coward take a dangerous post like here, in the midst of the enemy?
Anyway, I'm not a fool.
That's why you're here.
While you and Mr Pidgeon were at liberty I was in constant danger.
I waited a long time too. Five weeks wasn't it Miss Lang?
Yes, Herr Van Dyne.
Patience is its own reward, as no doubt you know from your own job.
By the way, what is your job now?
Oh, well. We'll talk later.
I am quite prepared to meet with this fellow, the captain of the Danish ship.
We know all about the Helvig, don't we Lieman?
The Helvig? Yes, Herr Van Dyne.
You were traveling on a neutral ship to a neutral port.
You were reported this morning to Contraband Control.
We know about it, don't we Lieman.
─ Yes, Herr Van Dyne, this morning.
You and Mr Pidgeon have been traveling in neutral ships for the past six months.
This time, you sent your information through the usual channels.
But you saw how you could save the Admiralty five days.
Just what is that information,
Mrs Sorenson?
It doesn't occur to you that I've merely come home?
I know you Mrs Sorenson. I know people of your kind.
You're not a secret agent who works for money. You like to do it.
It's in your nature to ask for trouble.
Adventure is in your blood.
Now, you have important information for the Admiralty.
I know their agents never communicate with their departments personally.
They do it by code.
Therefore such a coded message must be in your possession.
Well, where is it?
Nothing is in your notebook. Your lipstick contains nothing but lipstick.
Your cigarette case contains nothing but cigarette papers and a made cigarette.
Curious to find a woman who makes her own cigarettes.
I once met a woman who smoked a clay pipe.
Really? How interesting.
May I ask you to take off your clothes.
Miss Lang will help you, won't you Miss Lang?
Yes, Herr Van Dyne.
Well, Mrs Sorenson?
Can I have a cigarette?
─ Certainly.
At our last meeting it was a sign of surrender when you asked for a cigarette.
May I have one of my own?
─ Of course.
You always did prefer your own cigarettes, didn't you?
I remember at our last meeting ..
Of course! That's why I couldn't find anything on you.
I should still like a cigarette.
So that's your job M47.
To find out under what neutral names
German vessels sail across the Atlantic.
Well, we know all about that, don't we Lieman?
Yes Herr Van Dyne.
All marked with the same special water-mark.
Well, if the Admiralty wants a message, why shouldn't they have one. Lieman!
Can you find a neutral ship, preferably American.
And bound for Europe.
─ Yes, Herr Van Dyne.
We have an excellent one here.
American freighter M.S. Mirabelle.
7000 tons.
Oil-burning cargo machinery from St Elisabeth.
I think I have to go now Herr Van Dyne.
The cinema will be nearly over.
Go ahead.
─ Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Well, we can leave S.S. Lingham.
But we'll make the Admiralty believe she sailed under the name of the Mirabelle.
What's the point?
─ Don't you understand?
I bet your Miss Lang understands.
You think there will be trouble if an English warship arrests this American freighter?
But we are not Germans, who shoot first and ask questions afterwards.
You will see Miss Clayton, the skipper of the Mirabelle will get tough.
As the Admiralty have definite information that the Mirabelle is really a German ship.
The English Command will get tough too.
As the Americans cannot bear anybody to be tougher than themselves ..
Well .. that's how wars start.
[ national anthem ]
Your National Anthem Mrs Sorenson.
Why don't you stand up?
I see the Captain is already on his feet.
I seem to have missed a good deal.
I have no quarrel with any neutral Captain.
As long as he remains neutral.
Since you got mixed up in this affair,
I must treat you as an enemy.
I realize of course. that up until now I have been treated as a neutral.
But, with your permission or without, I intend to rejoin my ship before sunrise.
You're an optimist Captain.
─ And this lady is going with me.
We sail at dawn.
─ Tomorrow?
No .. today.
[ train whistle ]
I'm sorry I dragged you into all this.
You did your best to keep me out of it.
I hope Mr Pidgeon's clever, otherwise we're sunk.
He doesn't look very clever.
Still, perhaps he is.
After all, you don't look very clever either.
Yet you are.
─ How do you mean?
You both escaped from him before, didn't you?
Oh, you heard that.
─ Most of it.
And what do you think?
─ Hmm. Skol!
Skol!
Sorry I can't do anything about it.
─ Well, I can.
Yes, I know.
─ Know what?
You stiffened your muscles before you were tied up.
Good! And what happens now when I relax?
You get a little play in the rope.
And if somebody gives a good hard pull on the rope?
Who?
─ You.
How?
Haven't you got high heels and long legs?
─ Alright I'm doing it.
What are you waiting for?
─ Brother Grimm.
He must be given another chance to look at us.
Don't worry about him, he won't come down again. He can see us from where he is.
How?
─ Can you see the lift door?
No.
Well beside it is mirror which connects to another one upstairs.
The Gestapo had the same thing in the prison where I met Van Dyne.
You are clever. Do you think he's looking at us now?
No, you can always see a flash of light if anyone is looking at us.
I think I can bring him down.
What for?
─ Never mind.
First we move the chairs a little bit ..
─ Which way?
We want to be just opposite the door and the mirror.
Pull it to the right .. stop!
He's looking.
─ Now he'll come down.
What did I tell you?
Hello Mr Grimm.
─ Don't call me Grimm!
You were introduced to us as Grimm, Mr Grimm.
Is that all you came down for Mr Grimm?
You know why he came down?
You want me to say it? Why?
Because after we moved the chairs he could only see you.
I get you.
Before we start.
We let him have one more look through his periscope.
How did we get into this place?
Through a door. Iron. I think it was locked.
Along a passage, half bare-boards, half carpet.
Then, into the lift and down here.
─ More detail?
Can't.
─ Why not?
It was pitch-dark. I had to go where
I was pushed.
Smell anything?
─ Cooking.
Hear anything?
─ Only the cinema.
Close at hand?
─ No, rather muffled.
When they played "God Save The King" it came from over there.
[ music playing ]
Then what about that?
─ It's not the cinema.
It's a shuffle.
That banjo-player is good.
And the singer.
It must be a nightclub.
So, Van Dyne has his office under a cinema and a nightclub.
He's having his look.
In two minutes we shall be looking back at him.
Right, he's gone.
Now I relax ..
─ And I use my legs.
Come on!
─ It's not so easy.
Good girl.
I shouldn't hurt you.
─ Go ahead.
What can you see?
Courts.
─ Nothing else?
No .. just courts.
No sign of Brother Grimm.
Put your hands up .. like they were.
Now then.
Do you trust me?
─ Yes.
We shall catch that last train.
─ And warn Mr Pidgeon.
Yes .. and don't forget to talk if Grimm is looking.
Look out! He's there again.
Talk!
To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether it is nobler ..
He's gone!
If he suspects anything, we shall hear the lift coming down.
No. It's alright.
What are you going to do?
Start at the bottom and work up?
No. Get to the top, and work down.
I've got my fingers crossed.
Bye bye.
Hands up!
Patriotic .. Plaster .. Products.
Very clever Mr Van Dyne.
What do you think you're lighting?
A bonfire?
Why can't you ruddy Wardens mind your own business?
What do you expect me to light my pipe with? An electric battery?
Why don't you do something to earn your
3 quid week and leave tax-payers alone?
Poking your long noses into other people's pockets.
That's all the thanks you'll get.
Hey!
─ Good Lord!
Put out those lights!
─ They must be mad.
Go and see if we can get in that door.
Hoy! .. put out those lights!
Get a crowbar .. we'll have to break in.
Hoy!
Here's the crowbar .. now we're getting somewhere. Give him room.
No, no, no.
Hoy .. just a minute now.
Put out those lights .. Hoy!
Put out those lights!
Hey, put out those lights!
Hoy!
Ooh!
Oh.
Too bad you didn't catch him Harry.
What's this? German?
Nah .. French.
Commander Andersen.
─ That'll catch him alright.
Taxi! Taxi .. Taxi!
Taxi?
─ Who's next?
Not me .. I'm just in for dinner.
I'll keep it hot for you.
─ What's the name of the street?
Hanover Square. The Three Vikings.
Danish Restaurant.
Foreigner ain't he? Blimey, he's in a state.
What's yours John.
[ door knocking ]
Where's Walter?
─ Gone home.
[ door knocking ]
Better see who the silly fool is, but be polite. Very polite.
Captain Andersen!
Where's Mr Skold?
Mr Skold, get a map of London.
─ Get a what?
Get a map of London.
What are you waiting for? Get the Captain a map of London.
I need your help. I need all your help.
You remember the lady who was dining with me? She's in great danger.
Now listen .. there is going to be a fight.
A big fight! If you're all Danes, you don't want a reason for fighting.
Who do we fight? Come on.
Here is the map.
And now where do we go?
That's what we have to find out.
I've never seen the place from the outside.
Now you all know London.
Where is their a cinema and a nightclub in the same building?
The "Garden Of Eden".
The "White Negro".
The Mouse Trap.
There must be a least half a dozen places ..
Quiet please! Quiet! Quiet!
Where is Chester Square?
Here!
Chester Square.
Now .. steering by the stars ..
We navigated North North-East at an approximate speed of 8 knots.
We held that course for two and a half minutes.
That would bring us about here.
Well we all know it isn't there.
At the same speed, we proceeded due East for another two minutes.
We passed under a big arch.
Admiralty Arch!
Immediately afterwards we altered course North North-West for 4 minutes.
At a reduced speed.
That would bring us here.
Soho!
Right. So. Now to check it, we take a cross-bearing.
Give me a pencil.
Where's Hanover Square?
Hanover Square.
Somewhere where these two lines cross.
I say the "Garden Of Eden" or "The Mouse Trap" or "The White Negro."
But how would you know the right one?
─ Because I know the band.
There is a banjo player and a man who sings. We have to search until we find it.
Do we all go?
No, no, not all of you.
The five biggest will do.
Well line up, line up. But you can't go to a nightclub looking like you do.
Yes, somebody has to give me a decent suit. Somebody about my size. Now then.
You, you, you, you .. and you.
Your suit will do for me, and don't forget - white ties.
Get me the Army And Navy Club.
─ The Army And Navy Club.
Mr Pidgeon?
─ Who wants him?
The lady is in the cab. Won't come in.
Call Mr Pidgeon!
It's about time she turned up.
He's been like a cat on hot bricks.
What it is to be young.
Where is the lady?
─ In the cab, sir.
Goodnight Bob.
─ Goodnight sir.
Army And Navy Club? He's just this minute left sir.
Where to, sir?
─ Regency Hotel, Little Row.
What the devil happened to you?
I thought we arranged to meet .. Ahh!
You heard the address.
Mr Pidgeon!
Just a brandy please.
We're not staying long.
That's very nice of you, sir.
Your order, sir?
Tell me, you have no banjo-player?
─ No sir.
Are you sure of that?
─ Yes, sir.
We've never had a banjo-payer gentlemen.
No banjo-player.
Perhaps we can send out for one for you sir?
Oh no, no.
Tell me .. have you a man singing here?
No sir.
─ No man singing here?
Waiter, haven't you a banjo-payer here?
No sir, I don't think so.
No banjo-player.
[ banjo music ]
[ banjo music ]
I like the banjo-player.
Do you know the muffin-man?
Do you know his name?
Yes I know the muffin-man.
He lives down Drury Lane. Hey!
A marvelous banjo-player.
Do you know the muffin-man?
Do you know his name?
Yes, I know the muffin-man, he lives down Drury Lane. Hey!!!
I can recommend our cellar.
Oh, but of course.
Everything our cellar contains will be brought up to your table.
Can't be a very big cellar.
Champagne.
─ At once, sir.
What do you think?
Haven't you a man singing here?
─ No sir, only a girl.
Are you sure?
Very sure sir. We have never had a man singer.
No man singing here.
You're going sir? You have ordered.
We are no longer interested in your cellar.
The man!
Of course, it could have been a girl.
Well, why don't you bring the champagne?
At once sir. Waiter. Champagne.,
This is our place alright.
She said she smelled cooking.
From the courtyard into the kitchen, and from the kitchen into here.
And let me in .. into the cloakroom.
Yes, of course, of course. I think we should get our coats.
Are we going?
─ No, no.
This is one of the men, behind us.
Is he looking?
─ No.
Watch those two, and don't let them follow me.
My coat.
That isn't my coat.
57 sir. That was your number.
I can't have that. It's not my coat.
─ It's the coat you gave me, sir.
Are you calling me a liar?
Let me see for myself.
I can't do that sir.
What on earth do you mean? Of course
I can look for my own coat.
What the devil do you think you're doing, you young whippersnapper?
Let the gentleman look for his coat.
Call the manager!
What a carry on!
Don't let them pass Skold.
─ No Captain.
What's going on? I must get through please.
Ahhhh!
Ahh!
Come on chaps! Come on.
The paper sir.
Give it to him, any time.
Go on!
Where is the lift? Behind this door?
Answer!
Skold!
─ Yes Captain.
Two men.
─ Yes, Captain.
Do you remember that code?
That door.
Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah!
Perhaps the ground floor?
No.
There must be a secret button for the basement.
But this is the basement.
How does the lift work?
─ Find out!
What can you do, but press every single button once.
Except you press every single button twice! Of course, that's it!
You remember my watch, Skold?
Now, which button would you be sure not to press twice?
I don't know.
─ The Start button!
Miss Lang? .. Miss Lang?
You always wanted to see me with my back against the wall.
Drop that gun.
I'm not an amateur, Captain Andersen.
My gun points at Mrs Sorenson.
One single movement.
─ One single movement.
Can we bargain?
─ What will you offer?
Freedom.
─ In return?
Freedom.
What guarantee?
─ My word.
Insufficient.
─ I am not like you Van Dyne.
I use my own name.
I don't kill people for the crime
 of recognizing me.
What I do is done by every secret agent.
You have spies in your own country, Captain.
These two .. they use their own names?
Can we bargain?
I'll put away my gun if you'll do the same.
Mrs Sorenson, would you bring in my coat and hat, please.
The Police are here. I've got your coat.
Well, what are you waiting for? Go on.
I give you my word .. that as soon as we step out of the lift ..
You are free to go where you like.
I hope we shall never meet again.
I hope so for your sake Captain.
I've no intention of visiting Germany.
You timed that very nicely Captain.
The Police are here.
Meet me at Victoria at 3:30.
Yes Captain. I locked them in.
Are you alright?
We haven't got much time.
─ And I've got to go to the Admiralty.
I know. We'll meet you at Victoria.
The window. Over there.
Careful. One step at a time.
Aren't you running with them?
─ No. I'll show you the way first.
Stop!
The lift is coming. Stay where you are.
Don't move.
Who's there?
─ Hello Van Dyne.
You didn't escape?
─ You innocent!
Well, your Police didn't get me anyway.
No wonder you hoped we'd never meet again.
Van Dyne?
He always said he was tough.
Well .. thank you for everything Erik.
And goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you all.
Luke .. Henry .. Bjorn .. Vorsbald .. Arnold.
Thank you Arnold .. and goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Now she's missed the train.
Pidgeon. You don't know that girl at all.
Done it?
Yes.
Here are your papers Captain, and here's your clearance paper.
You can heave up anchor whenever you like.
Skold! Heave up!
You should hoist this code signal to avoid being stopped again.
Well, Captain, next time I hope you make up for the dinner you missed.
Thank you Lieutenant-Commander Ashton and goodbye.
Oh, and uh .. here's a little something for your stomach-ache.
Mrs Sorenson .. the Captain wants to see you in his cabin.
Thank you.
That girl certainly likes trouble.
Come in Mrs Sorenson.
You wanted to see me Captain?
Sit down Mrs Sorenson.
Mrs Sorenson, because of you ..
The whole Control Port thinks I'm an old woman suffering from indigestion.
It's lucky that nobody knew what nonsense I was up to.
You think our Police and Intelligence departments are pretty dumb, don't you?
Open your stomach-powder.
And nobody knew.
[ watch chimes ]
I have had enough trouble because of you.
And I feel I shall have more.
Drop that life-jacket ..
Hoorah .. hoorah .. hoorah.
Subs for KG by "Targa".
What a beautiful old man.
What a lovely head.
India is filled with old men, memsahib.
But not like the one in the yellow turban.
He's like a head of John the Baptist.
The memsahib refers to the storyteller?
Are these silent monsters at peace with us?
It is but a truce they keep with man.
But I, who have seen their tusks stained red with blood...
I could tell you a tale of the silent ones.
For a few coppers? Eh?
Yea, for a bowl of rice?
What would you do with my image, memsahib?
I would keep it... for a memory of India.
Verily, you would have all India in your picture.
Nay, you would have the book
Of the jungle to read in my eyes.
In the beginning, you must think
Of nothing but silence... a silence so vast that the ear can hear it.
Great trees like the pillars of the temple... with ferns like green carpets underneath.
While above, under the dome of heaven
Where lived the winged ones... the wind moves restlessly,
Whistling across the roof of the world.
These are the eaters of grass
In a world of torn flesh.
Early the little fawns
Must learn their lesson__... feet that make no noise, eyes that see in the dark... ears that hear the leopard leaving his lair.
For the leopard lives by the law
Of claw and horn and fang...
He will kill for hunger and eat thereof... but he will never kill fork killing's sake ... a law all men break. but the jungle folk obey.
These are the lords of the jungle.
The tribe of Hathi, the silent ones.
They go their way, eaters of grass
In a world of carnage.
For the wolves are the true hunters of the jungle.
And like huntsmen,
They stick to their Clan... with a strict regard
For hunting Calls and tribal law.
Free Companions of the woods, they may
Fight and quarrel amongst themselves... until the strongest of them wins
The leadership of the pack.
Yet jungle folk say... the wisest amongst them is the tribe of Baloo, the bear.
He is a teacher of the jungle law.
Yet there is one who knows law__... the barrel-bodied mugger, the Crocodile... with his chin in the shallows
And lust in his cold heart... hoping to drag down to the depths
All who wander along his river bank.
And in the legends of the jungle
There is a black prince... shrewdest of the lords of claw,
Horn and fang...
As bold as a buffalo, as reckless as a wounded elephant... with a voice as soft as wild honey
Dripping from a tree.
Unbridled, unmastered, unafraid.
Bagrheera the black panther.
And now__
Behold, the villain of my tale.
The killer, the man-eater... the assassin who first brought murder to the jungle Clans.
Shere Khan, the tiger.
It is said that in his first kill__... when he was Cain to some
Poor Abel of the glades __... when he ran from the scene of his crime... the trees and creepers
Whipped him with their branches... and striped his yellow hide with the mark of Cain.
This evil lord must have his dish-lickers... his bullies for attendants.
Tabaqui the jackal.
And the hyena__... hungry for the scraps
Of their murderous master's feast.
But my tale is not alone
Of outcasts and heroes.
I will tell you also of the snake, Kaa, the wise one... the oracle who taught Mother Eve
The speech men use... for trickery and sin.
What is the book of life itself but man's war with nature... the struggle between village and jungle,
Under the mantle of wild creepers
And great trees... many a ruined City lies forgotten in the pages of time.
Yea, where a thousand war Chariots
Proclaimed the might of a great king... before whom all men bowed their heads.
Nothing remains but a trellis
For wild figs to sun upon.
But what of the great maharaja,
The loser in this battle?
He has left many such a palace
To his Cousins, the monkey folk.
The bandar-logs __
The outcasts of the jungle.
First you must picture me as I was, milords...
Buldeo, the mighty hunter.
It was a long time ago... and very far away... on a summer's evening in the Seeonee hills.
Ajao. Ajao.
Again some palaver.
Its Buldeo, master.
That fool would make speeches the whole day.
Come, Durga. Let, s listen to him.
Ajao.
You cannot build your houses just anywhere.
We have to plan out our village.
Someday there will be a mighty city here.
A mighty city with marble houses.
The temple shall be there, facing the marketplace.
That's where I wanted the bean patch.
No that's for the marketplace, as Buldeo says.
And the barbershop will face the temple.
I shall find someplace for the bean patches anyway-... outside your mighty city.
Go Durga. Take the child and the old man to the cart.
Nathoo.
Come Grandfather.
Did you hear that?
We're going to have a marketplace and a temple and a mighty city.
Aye we'll have all that
If we can beat the jungle.
But have you and your hundred years seen man win a war with nature?
Sit here Grandfather.
There Nathoo.
Now.
Go back to your work.
Nathoo?
Where are you my baby?
Rao. Look. Our little Nathoo, he has wandered away.
Now don't worry Messua.
The child couldn't go far.
I'll look for him right away.
Durga you search in there.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
- Nathoo.
- Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nat...
Buldeo.
Tiger. My husband.
Rao.
Abdullah. Singh.
Abdullah. Ali. Mohammed. Singh.
Tiger.
No.
No.
Poor master.
Poor Messua.
Let us all go and look for the child.
All men bring your spears.
Ali Singh Abdullah. Torches.
Follow me.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Poor little baby. Poor little Nathoo.
- And that poor mother.
- Poor mother
Is it every woman who can have a wolf nurse her baby for her?
Do you believe that Subahdar?
Oh yes memsahib.
And His Excellency your father, has many records... of wolf children from the Indian hills.
- It is true.
- True?
In the beginning was it not written... that the she-wolves loved the children of man?
Were not the wolves the foster parents
Of many a child in India?
Little naked and bold... the man's Cub entered the wolves' Cave.
Ahai.
He felt just as much at home with the cubs as at his mother's side.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Lost and tired, he fell asleep among his brothers of the jungle.
Akkela the father wolf,
And Rakksha the mother wolf... knew that Shere Khan is prowling outside
Looking for the man Cub.
So they took him into their family.
Nathoo.
He grew up with the cubs.
They called him Mowgli-- the Little Frog.
Father wolf taught him his business until every rustle in the grass... meant just as much to him as to his brothers the wolf cubs.
All the lords of the jungle became his friends.
He had only one enemy-
Shere Khan the tiger.
Did Mowgli live to hunt Shere Khan?
Did he live? Oh.
But had I known then what I know now.
Twelve years had passed... and Shere Khan was on the trail
Of the wolf boy.

Wait. Wait.
Let me handle him.
Buldeo. Buldeo.
Ow. He bit me.
He is a wild boy.
Cover him up. Cover him up.
Who are you boy?
Can't you hear?
Give me a torch. A torch.
Give me that torch.
This boy has never seen fire before.
He's from the jungle.
Yes he is a wild boy.
We must be kind to him. Release him.
Release him?
Are you mad?
This is a thing of the jungle.
Let me look. Let me look.
Look at the scars on his arms and legs.
Those points on his bones--
He has run on all fours... with wolf cubs.
Poor child.
This boy has been reared in the jungle.
He has the evil eye.
I begin to think he has.
Moonshine.
I think this boy is Messua's little baby which was stolen that day we built the wall.
Could this boy be your's Messua?
No. He's not mine.
But he's a handsome boy.
Eyes like red fire.
Any woman would like to have a son like him.
But my Nathoo was soft and plump.
But, mistress, how could he be plump running naked in the woods?
I warn you all. He has the evil eye.
No, Buldeo.
He is some poor, lost lad-- though not my own.
But I am a lonely woman, and if you would let me...
I will shelter him for some other woman who has lost her son.
He is a wolf.
Let one in, and all will follow.
He will bring down the jungle upon us.
What the jungle has taken,
The jungle has restored, Buldeo.
Aye. Aye.
Take this boy into thy house my sister.
And out of your little hoard of money, forget not to honor me... for I have saved his life on this day.
- Release him.
- Wait.
Are you going to turn this devil loose before I can protect you?
A gun.
- Buldeo--
- Don't...
A gun.
Buldeo.
Now release him.
No.
No.
Boy.
Boy.
Will you come with me?
Come.
Oh. It's, it's all right.
Come on.
Come along. Come.
Come.
It's all right. Come along. Come.
It's all right.
Down upon our heads even before the temple... we have called the curse of the beast.
No more shall we prosper.
The wild pig will trample down our vines.
The tiger will stalk our streets.
We have opened our doors to the devil.
Don't look upon evil.
Mahala. Get home to bed.
At least I can keep my own daughter from harm.
Get back, Kpota.
Is that anyway to treat one who has come to live with us?
I remember the day I gave the first little shoes to my Nathoo.
Wolf-- Uh, wolf boy.
Uh...
Oh, those feet have never worn shoes.
No, you are not my son.
But you look very much like my son Nathoo.
Nathoo called me 'Mother'.
'Mother'.,
'Mother'.,
M-- Mother.
Uhh.
And what did the wolves... call you?
Wolves.
M...
Mowgli.
Mowgli?
A little frog?
Yes, you were like a little frog to them, the beasts of the jungle.
And so you are Mowgli to me.
Come.
Come on.
For months and months after that night...
Mowgli was busy learning the ways,
Language and customs of men.
What are you doing?
You are like a little panther.
I thought someone had found the hiding place.
- Hiding place?
- Mm-hmm.
- What is this?
- Money.
What is it for?
What is money for?
To protect us from hunger and cold.
It lives in a hole like a cobra?
No.
If we need a bag of rice, I give these to the merchant in the square.
He gives us the rice.
- What a fool that merchant must be.
- No.
Will the Man-Pack give us anything for this?
Yes.
Will Buldeo give me a tooth?
Tooth? You have all your teeth.
No. A -A sharp tooth.
Oh, a knife?
Yes. A knife tooth, like a tiger's knife.
What need have you for a knife?
To sink it in the throat of my enemy.
Your enemy? Ha. You talk about
Akela, the father wolf... and Raksha, the
Mother wolf, and how much... better it is in the jungle with all your friends.
Now who could be your enemy?
Shere Khan, the tiger.
Tell Buldeo to sell you a knife.
Give him the money.
I shall have a tooth.
I shall have a tooth.
My father says I mustn't speak to you.
What happened to him?
My father shot him.
We missed you six moons ago.
He was Baloo's cousin.
He had no man for an enemy.
But my father kills every bear he sees.
Why?
Because he is a great hunter.
He kills them even when he's not hungry?
Hungry? We don't eat bears.
Then why did he bring him here?
To show how brave he is.
And my father was very brave to kill that tiger.
That old tiger?
He lived on lizards and rats.
He was too old to hunt rabbits.
He must have died in his sleep.
I see. You could kill the bear and the tiger with one shot.
I kill Baloo's cousin?
I've gone fishing with him.
Fishing with a bear?
How can a bear bait a fishhook?
He looks in the river, he sees the fish he wants, then who.
He knocks it out.
Didn't I tell you not to speak with this thing?
I told Messua to keep you away from this house.
Messua sent me here to talk to you.
She sent me to get a tooth.
A tooth?
Yes. This is the tooth I want.
Put that knife down before I send a shot through you.
And then you would put my head on the wall... like the old Khan there.
But I would spring as I die and give this tooth back to you.
Now, now.
You're not in the jungle, boy.
No.
No, I am not in the jungle, Buldeo.
I am with the Man-Pack, but I am not a man.
What are you, boy?
I was until now a cub.
But now I have my tooth.
I can run with the jungle as I please.
I am a wolf.
If you had a knife... would you go back to the jungle?
The knife is yours for two annas.
Messua gave me three.
One, two, three.
There. Three is more than two.
Yes. More than two.
Now get out of my house.
See, Shere Khan?
- 'Tis for you-- deep in your throat.
- Mowgli.
Won't you be afraid to go back to the jungle?
Afraid of the jungle? Why?
I'm of the wolf pack.
They are my friends.
Then why did you buy the knife?
For Shere Khan, the tiger.
This is for him.
He drove me out of the jungle.
He went away far off... but he swore he would lay my bones in the river when he returned.
I also made a little promise.
I have told the wolves I would kill him.
You can speak their tongue?
You can speak to animals?
Can you talk to Rama, the great herd bull?
Rama is a dumb slave.
He has been with the Man-Pack so long... he cannot talk to anyone.
Can you speak to him?
What did he say?
Don't you know what the monkey people always say?
'We, the monkey people, are the greatest folk in all the jungle.
We know this is true because we always say it is true.
Mowgli, will you let me
Hear you talk to the wolves?
Yes.
Tonight when the moon rises.
- Are you afraid?
- No.
Let's go.
It's a wolf. What did he say?
Wood and water.
Wind and tree.
Jungle favor go with thee.
You have been given the favor of the jungle.
We be of one blood... you and I.
We be of one blood, you and I.
Come, Mowgli. Come.
Come. Come.
Ahai, Hathi.
I am with the Man-Pack now.
See, I have my tooth-- as sharp as a tiger's tooth.
He said Shere Khan is far away... but I had better take care and hide when he comes back here.
Hathi, will you warn me when he comes back to our jungle?
Thank you, brothers.
Then we shall see whose bones will be laid in the river.
Hold on. Tight.
Bagheera.
Mowgli.
Your claws are sharp and strong.
But not as good as mine.
Look.
Who is man that I should care for his ways?
Brown digger, eater of earth.
I am Mowgli of the jungle, back in the night.
Now that I have my tooth, who shall stay me when I strike?
Mowgli, come back.
I'm afraid.
There.
Mighty hunters, greater than your father... who killed everything until the jungle killed them.
Why did they go away?
Why did I go away?
Because I was a man cub, afraid of a tiger.
The jungle knew I was afraid and cast me out.
This was the king's palace.
King?
What is a king?
Oh, Mowgli. You know so much, and yet you know so little.
This was a great walled city... a city with hundreds of elephants and thousands of horses... and thousands and thousands of men.
And it all belonged to a great king.
And where is this great king now?
And where is this great king now?
Where is he now?
Where is he now?
Mahala?
Mahala?
- Mahala?
- Mowgli. Mowgli.
Here I am.
Mahala, are you hurt?
No, I'm all right.
The king's treasure chamber.
Look.
The emeralds.
Pearls.
This is like the stuff I gave Buldeo for my tooth.
The stuff that passes from hand to hand and never grows warmer.
Only this is yellow, and that was brown.
Let's get back to the light.
These pebbles are no good to eat.
There is nothing here. Nothing.
Am I nothing?
Father of cobras, we be of one blood, you and I.
She's only a little cub from the Man-Pack.
She means thee no harm.
Who art thou with the knife and the snake's tongue?
Mowgli, they call me.
I am of the jungle.
The wolves are my people.
Father of cobras, who art thou?
I am the warden of the king's treasure.
The great king built the stone above me that I might teach death... to those who come to steal.
Three times the stone has been lifted by thieves.
Look at thy feet.
The thieves are still here.
But I am no thief.
Indeed.
Be still, Mahala. Be still.
Oh, no, boy.
Let her run to and fro a while.
Let her make some sport.
The others did so until I touched them.
Then they whimpered a while... sighed and were still.
Kill him, Mowgli. Kill him.
Kill him?
Don't be afraid.
Look. Our father of cobras is so old, he has outlived his poison.
Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.
I am ashamed.
There has been too much talk of killing.
Come, Mahala. We'll go now.
Keep that silly treasure.
But I'll take this.
I can use it to prod Rama with.
Look at the ruby, Mowgli.
You could buy hundreds of villages with it.
Aye, boy. Thousands of villages.
Take it with thee.
But see that it does not kill thee at last.
Kill me? This stone?
Yes. I have outlived my poison... but that ruby holds more death than all my tribe.
It will kill and kill and kill... for killing's sake.
My strength is dried up, but this stone will do my work.
It is death, it is death, it is death.
But take the ruby if thou wilt.
Nay, father of cobras. I believe thee.
We shall go as we came.
Aye.
Ye be wise to take no death with thee.
May I take just this one piece, Mowgli?
Keep it if you like.
Get up, lazy bones.
I dreamed I was a princess in the city of the great maharaja.
Get up.
There's no fire in the grate, and there is no rice here.
But it was not a dream.
I saw the great king's city.
Get on with you.
Enough of this talk.
Dream?
This is no dream.
Maybe I am dreaming.
This is pure gold.
Who gave this to you, my darling child?
The white cobra.
Cobra?
Yes.
I did not want the diamonds.
Diamonds?
Nor the big ruby.
Big ruby?
This big.
This big.
Where? What nonsense is this?
Where is this room-- this ruby?
When did you go there?
Whose gold is this, Mahala?
The great king's gold.
In the treasure chamber
Of the king's palace.
I tell you, Father, Mowgli said
I might keep just this one.
Mowgli?
You have been in the jungle?
Last night Mowgli took me there.
But, Father, you will not hurt him?
I would not harm a hair on his head.
But you must never let anyone know about this.
Not a living soul, do you hear?
Yes, Father.
Good morning, Buldeo.
Good morning.
I-I can't take you now, Buldeo.
It'll be at least another hour.
Now wait a minute, Barber.
There-There is no river between us.
Oh. Oh, my-- my poor leg.
Uh, uh -This lumbago is killing me.
I can't go around with half my beard cut.
Ooh. Th--This lumbago is terrible.
I-- I-I can hardly bend my knee.
What makes you tremble like wash upon a line?
Now you keep out of this, Buldeo.
If I cut him, he-he doesn't have to pay.
- Y-You want to cut me?
- No, no.
Now listen here, barber.
I'm not a man to be shorn like a sheep in the midst of a brawl.
- Barber-
- I want...
- Barber?
- Hmm?
Move your left foot.
Well, uh...
I said the left foot.
Oh, oh, the-the l-l-l-l... l-l-- left.
Left.
This foot.
Excuse me, Buldeo.
You are standing on my money.
- Your money?
- I saw it first.
Jackals....
- It's mine.
- There's no need to quarrel.
- There's enough for all.
- Where? Where?
There's a lost city... in the jungle.
- You have found a treasure.
- Where?
Shh. Do you want to tell the whole village?
Not a word now.
My daughter found it with the jungle boy.
Tiger's coming.
Up, you dumb ones. Up.
Up. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho.
Tiger. Tiger.
- Th-Th-The--
- Tiger.
To the temple. To the temple.
To the temple.
To the temple, all of you.
Shut the gates. Shut the gates.
Tiger. Tiger.
- Quickly, Little Frog, to the temple.
- No. Not I.
- I have my tooth.
- No, no. Don't go. Don't go.
Mowgli.
Wait.
Don't go. He will kill you.
No. I shall bring back his yellow hide.
Mowgli.
Mowgli.
Where is your son, Messua?
Where did he go?
Stop him. He has gone after the tiger.
Oh, that bragging of a child.
Don't be impatient, Buldeo.
He'll be back.
Suppose the tiger should kill him.
Ooh, what a tragic calamity.
No, no, we must save him.
We must bring him back.
How kind you all are to comfort me this way.
He really is a sweet boy.
I knew you would come to love him.
Love him? I wish I had a boy like him.
Now, don't worry.
If he's not back in a short time,
I'll track him to the ends of the earth.
Kaa.
Kaa.
I want to sleep.
Go away.
I have to talk to you.
Who are you?
Can't you see, Kaa?
What does the Law of the Jungle say?
We be of one blood... ye and I.
Ye come.
Ah.
It is a manling.
It's I, Mowgli, Kaa.
The Little Frog... the one that used to throw stones at me?
I was a cub then, Kaa.
You called me a flat-headed earthworm.
Forgive me... for you are a wise, old, strong... and most beautiful Kaa.
True.
I am beautiful.
Yes.
I am beautiful.
Now that I am a man,
I have a tooth.
I wish to pull the whiskers of death.
The striped one?
You know all things?
I know that Shere Khan has killed... and eaten... and now sleeps by the bamboo.
Tabaqui the jackal told me so... uh, before he passed on.
Tabaqui?
Yes, indeed.
Here he is.
How may I slay his master, Kaa?
He'd kill you with one blow.
Let us go upstream.
Hold on, little brother.
Shere Khan is nothing but a big cat... and all cats fear the water.
But Shere Khan will not follow me into the river.
Since you're a man... use your cunning.
And if I made him angry, Kaa... will he follow me into the river?
If he will not catch you first.
Thank you, wisest of all.
Go on.
I'll wait for you here.
Wish me good hunting...
O wise, strong and most beautiful Kaa.
Good hunting.
Good morning, Shere Khan.
Did I wake you up?
You hunter of worms... you striped cattle thief.
Don't sneak away.
Coward.
You mangy yellow dog.
Come back.
Can't you jump?
Are you too old, you frog eater?
Fish killer.
I'll get your hide today.
No, no. I won't come down.
You come up to me.
Get this.
And this.
Bah.
Come on, Shere Khan. Catch me.
- This is getting dangerous.
- Yes.
Maybe there are tigers waiting for us in this tall grass.
All right.
Stay here.
Shere Khan is dead.
I have killed Shere Khan.
What if he finds the boy and tears the secret from him... and-and then says he didn't find him?
You're right.
We cannot trust him.
Uh, you go first, and I'll protect your rear.
You go first, and I'll protect your rear.
Go on.
By the Bull that bought me,
I made a promise... a little promise.
Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.
Come, Shere Khan.
Lend me your coat.
You won't need it anymore.
You don't need to shoot, Buldeo.
I have killed him.
Look at him.
This is the end of a very old war.
Hmm. You have killed him.
You found him there.
I killed him with my tooth.
He is mine.
Who are you to tell me what is yours?
Get up, boy.
You took my daughter to the jungle last night.
You took her to a lost city.
Come on.
Take me to the treasure chamber.
I will not take you, Buldeo.
The Lost City is a city of death.
The treasure is death.
- I will never take you there.
- Come on, jungle brat.
Come on, or I'll shoot you.
- Go ahead and shoot.
- You scum of the wolf cave.
I-I hope he didn't shoot the boy.
No. No.
That's a sign for us.
Change back to a man... and spare my life.
Spare my life, Mowgli.
I did not know you were anything more than a herd boy.
May I rise up and go away... my lord?
Get up.
Go. Tell Messua that Mowgli has avenged her man.
He has killed Shere Khan and will bring home his yellow hide.
Maharaja.
Look.
Great king.
Go on.
Maharaja.
- Maharaja.
- Great king.
- Tell me the secret too.
- Tell me too.
They say there's enough for three.
- Great king.
- Great king.
Three old vultures.
- Go back to your village.
- Yes, milord.
- Ma-- Maharaja.
- My king.
- Where -Where is the treasure?
- Go back to your village.
Maharaja. Great lord.
Here. Here, you.
- Did he tell you the secret?
- Come on. Where's the treasure?
Do ¡V Don't try to cheat us.
The boy told you where to go.
Boy indeed.
Didn't I tell you the first time I saw him he was a witch?
I saw him with my own eyes change himself into a black panther.
Come on, Buldeo. No tricks now.
If you try to cheat us, we'll change you into something worse, I swear to you.
Get down, Bagheera.
Stop their quarrel.
The boy turned himself into a black panther before my eyes.
He is a witch, I tell you.
I must warn the village.
- Buldeo--
- Here.
I still think you're lying, and I'll soon find out.
Ho.
Ho.
Come, Shere Khan.
Look at Buldeo, the mighty hunter.
Ho.
Ho.
Now go get him. Get him.
What have I done?
Why do you stand there gaping so?
Gather branches. Build a fire.
Remember, he must have a chance to confess.
Yes, the three of us will deal with him alone.
We'll deal with him all right.
Clear the way.
Buldeo, we are ready.
Bring the witch-boy.
Well, boy?
Witch or devil, whatever you are... you heard them.
They are ready.
One last choice... the secret or the fire.
Buldeo.
Buldeo.
Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.
Good.
You talk to him.
I will leave you alone.
He won't tell.
I think we'll have to burn him.
Then we would never find the treasure.
We'll burn him... but not now.
The boy will lead us to the Lost City first.
Nathoo, my little son... why won't you tell them the secret?
Never will I take them into the jungle.
But they will set you free... free to live with me.
- Live with you?
- Aye.
I have a jungle mother too... and these two things fight together in me... like the snakes fight together in the spring.
I was a wolf.
The jungle cast me out.
I am a man.
The Man-Pack cast me out.
But you have killed Shere Khan.
You can go back to the jungle.
Aye, you can be lord of the jungle.
No.
I have nowhere to go... but into the Red Flower-- the fire.
No.
But it does not matter.
The jungle will know from Bagheera that I have killed Shere Khan.
No. The jungle will know from you, Mowgli.
See? Here is your tooth.
Mother.
Watch, watch, watch, watch.
- See them'
- He'll escape.
Are you also too dumb to see it?
Of course. He'll escape, and then we'll follow him to the treasure.
That's right.
You two go to the edge of the jungle.
Wait there and mark his trail.
Go.
Your time is up.
It's the mother witch who freed him.
Get her.
Wait. Wait.
Messua is no witch.
But Buldeo is a bad...
Tie both of them until I return.
Buldeo. He entered by this tree.
He never suspected we let him escape.
Don't say that.
See?
There is his trail.
I'm ¡V I'm frightened.
Hmm.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We have our guns.
Let's go.
We can't be very far away.
Listen, brothers.
I have planted tracks for them as deep as an elephant's.
They will be here soon.
Quiet, you grinning black shadow.
Quiet, gray brother.
This is not our kill.
- Look, look.
- Look.
- Wait for me.
- Not so fast....
I will be the maharaja.
I will be the maharaja.
I will be the maharaja
Of this mighty city.
I will be the chief of all the temple.
I will be the chief of all the temple.
I will have all the barber shops.
I will have all the barber shops.
Let's look for the treasure.
Let's look for the treasure.
You look over there.
Uh--
Look.
I found it. I found it.
He found it.
Come on. He found it.
Wait for me.
Wait for me.
He found it. Come on.
Wait for me, Buldeo.
- Let us go in there.
- Let us go in.
I-I-- I found it.
I-I claim the right of first choice.
That's right. You deserve it.
He goes first.
I'll help you.
Help yourself. I'll help you.
Shoot. Shoot.
Sh-Sh-- Shoot.
Don't ¡V Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Shoot. Shoot.
No, no. Don't ¡V Don't shoot. Don't.
Pull me out. Pull me out.
Pull me, Shoot, will you?
Pull me up.
You missed him.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
A million.
I'll never have to count again.
Maybe we've been cheated.
It's gold. It's gold.
It's the mother and father
Of all the rubies in the world.
Where's my royal turban?
They're all pure gold... and they're all mine.
I shall walk upon gold.
I shall eat upon gold.
I shall use gold for a coverlet.
- Give it to me.
- Give it to me.
- It's mine.
- Give it to me.
No. Are you mad?
Shall I bash your heads in?
- Give it to me. I had first choice.
- No, it's mine.
The old cobra was right.
First, they go mad.
Don't forget, Buldeo, we are two to one.
I want that ruby.
- Let go.
- It's mine.
- Let go.
- You miserable barber.
It belongs to my robe.
It belongs to me, you understand?
- It's mine.
- Have we lost our reason?
Are we children?
Isn't there enough for three, 300, 3,000?
We'll be the most powerful men in all India.
Here.
I can buy thousand of rubies like this with my share.
Buldeo, you are wise and good.
You saved my life.
You killed the cobra.
You are my friend.
Then stop quarrelling.
Load yourselves up.
We have to get out before nightfall.
Hurry. We've got to get out of here now.
Thieves. Vultures.
Get out of the jungle.
Get out.
D-Did I hear what I heard?
The panther spoke with the tongue of the boy.
Yes.
The boy spoke with the tongue of the panther.
This place is bewitched.
Oh, the gold.
This is the way.
Where's the log? It was here.
How do we cross now?
We can wade through.
Wait.
There are crocodiles in this river.
What are you waiting for?
- It's this way.
- No, no. We came past this tree.
- I tell you, it's this way. Come on.
- No.
Quiet. Don't argue, Barber.
You're going the wrong way.
You're going the wrong way.
Give it to me.
- Wait here. Come on. Come on.
- Look.
They are heading back to the Lost City.
- Here it is. There it is. Come on.
- Over there is right. Let's go.
Come on.
Now I shall see if Father Cobra spoke the truth.
If the thing is death... these men will die.
You saw it.
I only wanted to look at the gold.
And he-- he tried to kill me.
I had to do it, Buldeo.
I had to do it.
Naturally.
You -You must bear witness.
Please, you must bear witness, Buldeo.
Quiet, gray brother.
He tried to kill me, Buldeo.
You must bear witness.
I had to kill him.
I had to kill him, Buldeo.
He...
Help. H-H-Help.
Help.
Did I hear someone call?
Now, gray brother... there is only one.
Bagheera, gray brother... chase him out of the jungle.
Sing him home.
You grinning monster.
Change into any beast you will.
Wolf, panther... any beast you will.
I'm not afraid of you.
Change.
Change.
Scream.
Scream, you witches of the forest.
Scream.
I'll burn that mother witch Messua... and I'll come back with a hundred strong... and set fire to your jungle... when the east wind blows.
I'll burn you all.
Burn you all.
Burn you all.
Hathi. Thou knowest the village
Of the Man-Pack that cast me out.
They're idle, senseless and cruel.
They do not kill the weaker for food... but for sport.
When they are full-fed, they would throw their own breed into the Red Flower.
This I have seen.
It is not well that the Man-Pack should live here anymore.
Kill them? Why?
What good are their white bones to me?
We shall let the jungle in upon them... and give the village back to the wild gourd vine.
They will burn us both.
Why did you fight them, Durga?
Why did you defend me?
It was I who brought him into the world.
He's my son.
Aye, mistress.
You could have saved yourself, Durga.
No, mistress.
If you must leave the world tonight, it is written that I shall go with you.
Buldeo is here. Look.
Buldeo.
What happened?
- Where is the pundit?
- Where is the barber?
Dead. Both dead.
Killed by the wolfboy.
But I know how to deal with him.
I'll burn him.
Burn him up.
I'll burn him.
We're all lost if the wind turns.
The jungle is burning.
Hurry up, Hathi.
Mowgli.
Where's my mother?
What have you done with her?
They left Messua bound in her house.
They would not let me take her.
They said she was a witch and that the fire would take her.
Now the same fire will take them.
But they were frightened, Mowgli.
Lead them, Mahala, to the little island in the middle of the stream.
- Where we saw the elephants, Mowgli?
- Yes. The fire can't touch you there.
Hurry. The wind is shifting.
Break the door, Hathi.
Break the door.
Push. Push.
Harder. Push.
I knew you would come.
See, Durga?
You'll be safe among them now.
- But you, my son-- Come with us.
Not while one little cub is in danger.
Now, go too.
Go on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Swim, gray brother. Follow me.
This way. Follow me.
Come on, Bagheera.
Come on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Go on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Mowgli.
Come back with us at last.
I am of the jungle.
Their lair is my lair.
Their trail is my trail.
Their fight is my fight.
Ahai.
He's no longer my son.
He's a godling of the woods.
So I didn't have my revenge after all.
I became no Mharaja... of a mighty city.
Even the little village burned to the ground.
In my struggle with the jungle... as you see, milords...
I was beaten.
And then? What happened then?
What became of Mowgli and your daughter?
And how did you escape from the fire?
That, memsahib... is another story.
You see? You see the symbolism of it?
Capital and Labor destroy each other.
It teaches a moral lesson.
It has social significance.
Who wants to see that kind of stuff?
It gives me the creeps.
Tell him how long it played in the Music Hall.
It was held over a fifth week.
Who goes to the Music Hall?
Communists!
Communists? This picture's an answer to Communists!
It shows we're awake... and not dunking our heads in the sand like a bunch of ostriches!
I want this picture to be a commentary on modern conditions.
Stark realism. The problems that confront the average man.
- But with a little sex.
- A little, but I don't want to stress it.
I want this picture to be a document.
I want to hold a mirror up to life.
I want this to be a picture of dignity... a true canvas of the suffering of humanity.
But with a little sex.
- With a little sex in it.
- How about a nice musical?
How can you talk about musicals at a time like this, with the world committing suicide?
With corpses piling up in the street, with grim death gargling at you from every corner,
- with people slaughtered like sheep!
- Maybe they'd like to forget.
Then why did they hold this one over for a fifth week? For the ushers?
- It died in Pittsburgh.
- Like a dog.
- What do they know in Pittsburgh?
- They know what they like.
If they knew what they liked, they wouldn't live in Pittsburgh.
If you pandered to the public, you'd still be in the horse age.
You think we're not?
Look at Hop-along Cassidy.
You look at him!
We'd still be making Keystone chases, bathing beauties, custard pie...
- And a fortune.
- A fortune.
Of course I'm just a minor employee here, Mr. LeBrand...
He's starting that one again.
I wanted to make you something outstanding... something you could be proud of, something that would realize the potentialities of film... as the sociological and artistic medium that it is.
With a little sex in it.
Something like...
- Something like Capra. I know.
- What's the matter with Capra?
Look, you want to make O
Brother, Where Art Thou?
Yes.
- Now, wait a minute!
- Then go ahead and make it!
For what you're getting,
I can't afford to argue with you.
That's a fine way to start a man out on a million-dollar production.
You want it, you've got it!
I can take it on the chin.
I've taken it before.
- Not from me you haven't.
- Not from you, Sully, that's true.
Not with pictures like
So Long Sarong,
Hey, Hey, In the Hayloft,
Ants in Your Plants of 1939...
But they weren't about tramps, lockouts, sweatshops, people eating garbage in alleys and living in piano boxes and ash cans.
- And phooey!
- They're about nice, clean young people... who fell in love... with laughter and music and legs.
Now take that scene in
Hey, Hey, In the Hayloft...
But you don't realize conditions have changed.
There isn't any work.
There isn't any food.
- These are troublous times.
- What do you know about trouble?
- What do I know about trouble?
- Yes, what do you know about trouble?
What do you mean, what do I know about trouble?
Just what
I'm saying.
You want to make a picture about garbage cans...
When did you eat your last meal out of one?
- What's that got to do with it?
- He's asking you.
You want an epic about misery... you want to show hungry people sleeping in doorways.
With newspapers around them.
You want to grind
10,000 feet of hard luck,
- and all I'm asking you is, what do you know about hard luck? - Yes!
- What do you mean? Don't you think I've...
- No.
- What?
- You have not.
I sold newspapers till I was 20, then I worked in a shoe store and put myself through law school at night.
- Where were you at 20?
- I was in college.
When I was 13 I supported three sisters, two brothers and a widowed mother.
- Where were you at 13?
- I was in boarding school.
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to be ashamed of it, Sully.
That's the reason your pictures have been so light, so cheerful, so inspiring.
They don't stink with messages.
That's why I paid you
500 a week when you were 24.
- 750 at 25.
- 1,000 when you were 26.
- When I was 26, I was getting 18.
- 2,000 at 27.
- I was getting 25 then.
- 3,000 after Thanks for Yesterday.
4,000 after Ants in Your Plants.
I suppose you're trying to tell me
I don't know what trouble is.
- Yes!
- In a nice way, Sully.
You're absolutely right.
I haven't any idea what it is.
People always like what they don't know anything about.
I had a lot of nerve wanting to make a picture about human suffering.
You're a gentleman to admit it, Sully, but then, you are anyway.
How about making
Ants in Your Plants of 1941?
- You can have Bob Hope, Mary Martin...
- Maybe Bing Crosby.
- The Abbott Dancers.
- Maybe Jack Benny and Rochester.
- A big-name band.
- What?
Oh, no. I want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?
But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do first.
I'm going down to wardrobe to get some old clothes,
- some old shoes,
- Huh? and I'm gonna start out with ten cents in my pocket.
What?
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm not coming back...
- till I know what trouble is.
- What?
Don't worry, you can take me off salary.
Who's talking about taking you off salary?
- So long. Thanks for the idea.
- Wait! Don't be so impulsive.
- How soon will you be back?
- I don't know.
Maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe a year.
Don't worry about me. And thanks,
Dracula. You gave me a great idea.
I gave you...
- Now look what you've done.
- Yeah... What I've done?
With your lies about selling newspapers!
I sold as many newspapers as you supported a family at 13.
- I opened a shooting gallery.
- With money you borrowed from your uncle.
- We better insure him for a million.
- He's worth more.
- The bonehead.
- Yes, but what a genius.
Get me a copy of that
O Brother, Where Art Thou?
I guess I'll have to read it now.
Make that two copies.
Why should I suffer alone?
- How's this?
- Isn't that overdoing it, a bit sir?
Why break their hearts?
All right.
Let's try that one again.
I think this one's sufficiently seedy, sir.
There's no use overplaying it, is there, sir?
Yes?
- Your wife is on one, sir.
- What does she want?
I suspect it has something to do with today's being the 15th.
Payday. All right, put her on.
You may connect Mrs. Sullivan.
Yes?
You don't happen to remember what day this is, do you, dear?
Yes, I happen to remember what day it is.
No, I haven't forgotten anything.
Have you?
Perhaps I could be a little more polite, Mrs. Sullivan, but somehow, when I talk to you
I don't feel polite.
I regret it, but that's the way it is.
I don't know whether
I signed it or not.
I always close my eyes when I sign your check.
Maybe I signed the blotter.
Have you made out the Panther Woman's check yet?
You better get it down to her before she comes up here with the sheriff.
She has a very peculiar sense of humor.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Burrows.
How do you like it?
I don't like it at all, sir.
Fancy dress, I take it?
- What's the matter with it?
- I have never been sympathetic... to the caricaturing of the poor and needy, sir.
Who's caricaturing?
Burrows doesn't know about the expedition, sir.
I'm going out on the road to find out what it's like to be poor and needy, and then I'm going to make a picture about it.
If you'll permit me to say so, sir, the subject is not an interesting one.
The poor know all about poverty... and only the morbid rich would find the topic glamorous.
But I'm doing it for the poor.
Don't you understand?
I doubt if they would appreciate it, sir.
They rather resent the invasion of their privacy, I believe quite properly, sir.
Also, such excursions can be extremely dangerous, sir.
I worked for a gentleman once who likewise, with two friends, accoutered themselves as you have, sir, and then went out for a lark.
They have not been heard from since.
- That was some time ago?
- 1912, sir.
- Huh.
- You see, sir, rich people... and theorists... who are usually rich people... think of poverty in the negative, as the lack of riches... as disease might be called the lack of health.
But it isn't, sir.
Poverty is not the lack of anything, but a positive plague, virulent in itself, contagious as cholera, with filth, criminality, vice and despair as only a few of its symptoms.
It is to be stayed away from, even for purposes of study.
It is to be shunned.
You seem to have made quite a study of it.
Quite unwillingly, sir.
Will that be all, sir?
- Thanks.
- Very good, sir.
He gets a little bit gruesome every once in a while.
Yeah.
Always reading books, sir.
- Oh.
- As a matter of fact, sir,
I don't like the idea of a gentleman of your inexperience... leaving with only ten cents in his pockets, so I took the extreme liberty, sir, of having a studio identification card... sewed into the sole of each of your boots.
You'd think I was a child.
The whole purpose of this expedition...
All right, all right, all right.
Before you all get started,
I just want to tell you one thing...
- My mind is made up.
- Nobody's here to argue, Sully.
- I know.
- You know that your slightest wish...
We talked it all over, and there's something to the idea.
- There's a great deal to it.
- Stupendous.
Cassy has it all worked out. It's safe as a church, big as a cathedral.
Bigger!
It's the story of the year.
It'll make the front page of every newspaper in the country.
- I'm sending five of my boys...
- With me in charge.
An advance agent in front and a follow-up behind.
- A cook and a still man.
- I want lots of 8x10's.
- Now, listen...
- I'm revamping that lovely land yacht...
that Demille used in Northwest Mounted.
- It follows at a discreet dis...
- Hot coffee, sandwiches, and a bar in back.
It's connected to the studio by shortwave, and it also carries...
- A hot shower and a secretary.
- And a physician.
Look, I'm trying to find trouble, but I won't find it with six acts of vaudeville on my tail... at least, not the kind
I'm looking for.
- Be reasonable, Sully.
- I'm reupholstering it from stem to stern.
- Wait till you see.
- I tell you, I've made up my mind.
- Definitely?
- Definitely.
In that case, there's nothing else to do...
You said it. but to serve you with this summons to appear and show cause... why you should not be restrained from jeopardizing your unique and extraordinary services... by willfully, recklessly and unnecessarily...
Will you please wait a minute!
We have all day, Sully, but you must realize... we also have minds, also made up.
Thus begins this remarkable expedition... into the valley of the shadow of adversity.
The shadow of the what?
The valley of the shadow of adversity.
- It's what you call a paraphrase.
- Alone and unattended...
With eight stooges.
I'll write the story, if it's just the same to you.
Prey to passing prowlers, poverty and policemen,
- How poetic.
- with only ten cents in his pocket,
- I wish I had what he's got in the bank.
- John Lloyd Sullivan, the Caliph of Comedy...
- Departed Hollywood at 4:00 this morning.
- You said it.
- Can I sell you another stack, Doctor?
- Get me some bicarbonate of soda, and don't call me "Doctor. "
He was talking to me, I think.
No, thank you.
You say don't want some bicarbonate of soda, Doctor?
Don't call me "Doctor"!
- No, I don't want any bicarbonate of soda.
- I thought you said you did.
Well, he don't!
- This place is very depressing.
- So was the breakfast.
Why doesn't he read a book if he wants to learn something?
- Who, the cook? He could learn plenty.
- No, Sullivan.
- Maybe he don't know how to read.
- The cook?
No, the...
- This is gonna be a great trip.
- Sorry. I must have the wrong number.
That was the lighthouse keeper on San Clemente Island.
Ask him what his daughter's doing.
I said the lighthouse keeper on San Clemente Island.
- How about a little gin rummy?
- I don't drink, thank you. Never touch it.
- How about a lift, Bud?
- If you don't mind going fast.
I'm studying to be a whippet tanker.
- Go to it, Lieutenant!
- You're there, General.
- Can a whippet tank make a sharp turn?
- What?
Can a whippet tank go up a side road?
A whippet tank can go anywhere.
Hang on!
Thank you, Major.
- This is where I get out.
- She's some tank, ain't she?
In a class by herself.
I never felt anything like it.
Well, I guess I better be getting to school now, anyway.
Yeah, I guess you better had.
Drive carefully.
- You know me.
- By the way, how old are you?
- Thirteen. So long.
- So long.
What a future.
What were you chasing, a jackrabbit?
- Felt more like a kangaroo.
- There he is!
- Well, how'd you like it?
- That was a dirty trick, boss.
Look, that was just a rough idea, unless you play ball with me.
You know I can't do what I started out to do with you guys chasing me around, so I'll make you a fair proposition.
You can go on wherever you like and take it easy for a couple of weeks, and I'll join you then or sooner.
If the boss wants to talk to me,
I'm just up ahead, mooching a lunch from a farmer's wife.
Now, is that a square proposition or isn't it?
Well, I always wanted to go to Boulder Dam.
You're there.
Yeah, well, if you think
I'm going to look at Boulder Dam...
How about
National Yellow Park?
That goes double for National Yellow Park.
- If you'd said Las Vegas...
- What do they do in Las Vegas?
Everything, Doctor.
It's an education.
All right. I'll meet you in Las Vegas, on or about the first.
And thanks, kids.
Thanks sincerely.
Yoo-hoo!
- Yes, ma'am?
- Don't get too tired.
Yes, ma'am.
First day's work. You don't suppose you're overworking him, do you?
Oh, but I doubt it. He seems very strong. Did you notice his torso?
- I notice that you noticed it.
- Don't be vindictive, dear.
Some people are just naturally more sensitive to some things in life than some people.
Some are blind to beauty, while others...
Even as a little girl, you were more of acid type, dear, while I, if you remember...
- I remember better than you do.
- Well, forget it.
And furthermore, I have never done anything that I was ashamed of, Ursula.
- Neither have I.
- Yes, but nobody ever asked you to.
Why, Zeffie
Kornhauser!
Now that you've had your attack for the day, let's endeavor to recapture our good humor and remember our breeding.
- Baloney.
- Yes. I do hope he likes it here.
It's so hard to keep a man.
Do you know what I need?
- Yes!
- I need a permanent.
I was thinking of taking in a picture show, which brings up the problem of clothes for the young man.
- It certainly does.
- Do you think...
dear Joseph would mind if we gave him...
some of the clothes he has so little need for now?
He's never minded before.
- Sleep tight.
- Yes, ma'am.
- And don't let the skeeters bite.
- Yes, ma'am.
- You're sure you have everything you want?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Absolutely sure?
- Positive.
- But your bed isn't open.
- That's all right. I'll take care of that.
Oh, nonsense.
That's woman's work.
? For men must work and women must weep?
Or however it goes.
Ahh!
- There. Would you like a hot water bottle?
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't any pajamas.
- I never use them.
- Joseph wore a nightgown.
- Is that a fact?
Oh, yes.
- Well, I guess there's nothing else.
- No, I guess not.
I'll let you know as soon as the bathroom is free.
- It's community.
- Ah.
Well, uh...
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Do you think he'll stay?
- I do, do hope so.
Who is it?
Say, could you give me a lift?
I'm freezing to death.
- What did you fall into?
- Everything there was.
Okay. Hop in the back.
Here. Drape this around you.
Thanks a million, buddy.
- Okay.
Come on, Buddy, wake up.
This is as far as I go.
- Huh? What? Who are you?
- Come on, wake up.
I don't want the boss to see you.
We ain't supposed to give lifts.
Sure. Thanks a lot.
- Hey, what city is this?
- That's Hollywood.
Hollywood?
You get a chance to see the moving picture stars.
Well, so long.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Give me a cup of coffee and a donut, if that's enough for it.
- You want it plain or with powdered sugar?
- With a little cream.
- The sinker?
- Any kind, or some rolls. I don't care.
Yes, sir.
Give him some ham and eggs.
Yes, ma'am.
That's very kind of you sister, but I'm not hungry.
A cup of coffee and a sinker will fix me up fine.
Don't be a sucker.
Give him some ham and eggs.
The way I'm fixed, 35 cents isn't going to make any difference.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Things a little tough, huh?
I wouldn't be sitting in an owl wagon for local color.
They locked me out of my room.
That's too bad.
Well, things are tough everywhere.
War in Europe, strikes over here...
There's no work.
- There's no food.
- Drink your coffee while it's hot.
What did they lock you out of your room for?
Did I ask you any questions?
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- You been in Hollywood long?
- Long enough.
- Trying to crash the movies or something?
- Something like that.
- I guess that's pretty hard to do, huh?
- I guess so.
I never got close enough to find out.
- Oh. Sorry.
- Say, who's being sorry for who?
Am I buying you the eggs or are you buying me the eggs?
I'd just like to repay you.
All right, give me a letter of introduction to Lubitsch.
I might be able to do that.
Who's Lubitsch?
Drink your coffee.
- Can you act?
- What did you say?
- I said, can you act?
- Sure, I can act.
Would you like me to give you a recitation?
Go ahead.
Skip it. My next act will be an impersonation... of a young lady going home... on the thumb.
- In that outfit?
- What about your own outfit?
- I mean, haven't you got a car?
- No. Have you?
- No, but...
- Then don't get ritzy.
And I'll tell you some other things I haven't got.
I haven't got a yacht, or a pearl necklace, or a fur coat, or a country seat, or even a winter seat.
I could use a new girdle, too.
I wish I could give you some of the things you need.
You wouldn't be trying to lead me astray, would you?
You know, the nice thing about buying food for a man... is that you don't have to laugh at his jokes.
Just think... if you were some big shot, like a casting director,
I'd be staring into your bridgework saying,
"Yes, Mr. Smearkase.
No, Mr. Smearkase.
"Not really, Mr. Smearkase.
Oh, Mr. Smearkase, that's my knee. "
Give Mr. Smearkase another cup of coffee. Make it two.
- Want a piece of pie?
- No thanks, kid.
Why, Mr. smearkase, aren't you getting a little familiar?
Look...
Thanks.
Look, if you wanted to stay in Hollywood a little longer...
I don't want to stay in Hollywood a little longer.
I've used up all my money, all my going-home money.
I was just gonna say,
I have a friend that's out of town... and you might be able to stay at his place for a couple of weeks... and maybe by then things will break a little better for you.
He might even be able to help you a little.
No, thanks.
There's no strings to this, kid.
I know you don't know who I am, but
I used to know a few people around here.
And this guy's really out of town.
And you know a way in through the window. No, thanks.
- No. I'm pretty sure that in this case...
- I'm going home, big boy.
I can get a ride out of here in a little while.
I don't like to think of you asking a bunch of thugs for lifts along the highway.
Then don't think about it.
You mean you'd just get in any car that comes along?
Anything but a Stanley Steamer.
My uncle blew up in one.
That's terrible.
You can't tell what kind of a heel is apt to be behind the wheel.
All heels are pretty much the same.
- Look.
- Yes, Mr. Smearkase?
This friend of mine... the guy I was telling you about that's out of town...
I'm sure he wouldn't mind if I borrowed his car.
- What is it, a street car?
- It's a car. Just wait here.
You're just going to get yourself in trouble.
I'm not going to get myself in trouble.
I'm going to repay you.
That isn't necessary, big boy.
Someday, when your ship comes in, you can buy somebody that's hungry some ham and eggs and be all square.
That's fine. Just wait here and I'll be back before you can say...
- What was that big director's name?
- Lubitsch.
Lubitsch.
Say, this is some car.
Yes. Now, where would you like to go?
Could you drop me off at, uh...
Or maybe that'd be too far.
- That depends entirely on where it is.
- Would Chicago be too far?
- Chicago? You mean Chicago, Illinois?
- Yes.
I wasn't actually thinking of driving as far as Chicago.
That's all right.
You can drop me anywhere.
I just happened to think of Chicago because... that's a little better than halfway and
I can easily hitch a ride out of there.
- Where do you live, Bermuda?
- You don't have to get funny.
I didn't ask you for a ride.
You can drop me anywhere.
Wait a minute. How's this?
Suppose you drop me off somewhere and you go leisurely home... and I'll pick up the car later.
That's what you call an idea.
You don't happen to operate out of a booby hatch, do you?
You better drop me at the next corner and take this bus back where you stole it from.
Don't talk nonsense. I left a note saying I was taking the car...
- Or did I?
- It would be nice if you could remember.
Would be funny, though, if they arrested me for taking it.
A panic.
Who does it belong to?
Belongs to a picture director... a guy named Sullivan.
Oh.
- You never heard of him?
- No.
He's made quite a few pictures.
Ants In Your Plants of 1939.
- Did he do that?
- Yeah. Did you see it?
- Yes.
- Well? Well, did you like it?
- Not much.
- Some people thought it was pretty good.
I don't care for musicals.
They hurt my ears.
I see. Well, did you like
Hey, Hey, in the Hayloft?
- Oh, I was crazy about that.
- I thought that would just about fit.
You remember the scene where the two are in the hayloft?
Perfectly.
And she made him close his eyes and count three before kissing her.
Yes, yes.
And then the pig came out and he kissed the pig instead.
It was on a very high plane.
Then he fell through a hole and sneezed at a horse.
And the horse sneezed back at him.
Oh, that was a wonderful scene.
Of course it was stupid, but it was wonderful. Who directed that picture?
Don't you think with the world in its present condition, with death snarling at you from every street corner, that people are a little allergic to comedies?
- No.
- Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
Say, how come you know a picture director well enough to borrow his car?
As a matter of fact,
I used to know most of those boys, but naturally I don't like to mention it in a suit like this.
As a matter of fact,
I used to be a picture director.
- Why, you poor kid.
- Don't get emotional. I'll be all right.
What kind of pictures did you make?
- More along educational lines.
- Oh, no wonder.
There's nothing like a deep-dish movie to drive you out in the open.
What are you talking about?
Film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known.
You take a picture like Hold Back Tomorrow.
You hold it.
- Did you ever meet Lubitsch?
- Yes.
Gee, I bet he wouldn't even speak to you now.
- He spoke to me day before yesterday.
- Isn't that swell.
Funny, isn't it... to meet your first picture director... on the day you're leaving
Hollywood, all washed up... even a washed-up director.
Don't get sympathetic.
I might make a comeback, you know.
That's what they all say.
Man that had my room ahead of me... he was always going to make a comeback.
He was a picture director too.
Then one day he shot himself instead.
They had to re-paper the room.
You wouldn't ever do anything like that would you, big boy?
Not on your wallpaper.
What do you suppose that is?
Whatever it is, there's absolutely nothing they can do.
Remember that.
What did you say?
I said there's absolutely nothing they can do.
All right, you.
All right yourself.
Don't give it a thought.
Well?
Oh, good morning, sir.
- I'm so sorry.
- Good morning, sir.
- Ever seen this man before?
- That is Mr. Sullivan, sir,
- the owner of the alleged hot car.
- Then what's all the hullabaloo?
That's what I'd like to know.
- You John L. Sullivan?
- What about it?
- What's your occupation?
- Motion picture director.
- That right?
- Yes, sir.
Let me see your driver's license.
- I haven't got it. Did you bring it?
- No, sir.
- Driving without a license, huh?
- Yes, isn't that terrible?
I suppose that calls for a dollar fine and ten minutes in jail.
- You sure this is Sullivan?
- Oh, quite, sir.
- What are you doing in those clothes?
- I just paid my income tax.
- All right, but you don't drive that car without a license. - Okay.
Let the girl out too.
She's getting bored in there.
How does a girl fit in this picture?
There's always a girl in the picture.
Haven't you ever been to the movies?
Where's he taking us now?
Whose car is this?
- The same guy. Sullivan.
- Where's he taking us?
Down to the depot to buy you a ticket and send you home. Stop fooling around.
- Who's buying me a ticket?
- Sullivan.
- What did I ever do for him?
- You bought him some eggs.
Oh. So you're the washed-up director.
I'm afraid I exaggerated that part of it a little bit.
What are you doing in those clothes?
I just pulled that one down at the police station.
Huh?
I made up a joke.
Look, I'm not sore at you.
I'm sore at those cops for dragging me all the way back here.
No matter where I start out for, I always end up right back here in Hollywood.
You're a very nice girl, as a matter of fact, and I'm glad to have met you.
If there's ever anything I can do for you, I'd be delighted. Honestly.
- You mean that?
- Sincerely.
Then buy me some ham and eggs before I bite you.
Home.
Where's the swimming pool?
You must have a swimming pool.
Right out here.
Outside dining room,
- barbecue...
- Hmm.
Pretty, isn't it?
Yeah.
There's the tennis court up there, grape arbor there, and a grove there.
I guess that's about all.
- What are you looking at me that way for?
- Hey, you big fathead!
- What's the big idea?
That's for your swimming pools and your tennis courts...
and your limousines and your barbecues.
That's for making fun of a poor girl who only tried to help you,
- you big faker!
- Who made fun of you?
You did, with your stories of being a washed-up director, you big clunk.
Oh, I did, did I?
Breakfast is served, sir.
- You might have shaved.
- I need these whiskers for my experiment.
- Yes, the noble experiment.
- You don't have to make any cracks.
I don't suffer and starve because I like it, you know.
Neither does anybody else.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- I'm sorry I pushed you in the water too.
- I probably needed it.
- You certainly did.
- Did I?
I didn't mind you. As a matter of fact,
I had kind of a yen for you.
- You have?
- Not in that thing.
I liked you better as a tramp.
I can't help what kind of people you like.
It's funny. I suppose
I ought to be very happy for you, as if you'd just struck oil or something.
Instead of that, I'm sore.
Don't frown.
You're making lines on your face.
You've taken all the joy out of life.
I was all through with this kind of stuff.
I knew I'd never have it, but there was no envy in my heart.
I'd found a friend who swiped a car to take me home.
Now I'm right back where I started... just an extra girl having breakfast with a director, only I didn't used to have breakfast with them.
- Maybe that was my trouble.
- Did they ever ask you to?
- No.
- Then don't pat yourself on the back.
- Take me with you.
- What?
On your experiment.
I don't want to be sent home.
Don't be childish.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You can stay here for a couple of weeks like I told you in the owl wagon, and when I get back,
I'll see what I can do for you.
I don't want to start all that stuff again.
Take me with you.
When you get as far as you're going, we can say good-bye... and I'll go the rest of the way alone.
It'll make a nice ending, and we'll finish what we started this morning.
It's absolutely out of the question.
Please. You don't know anything about anything.
You don't know how to get a meal, how to keep a secret,
- and you can't even stay out of town.
- Thanks.
I know 50 times as much about trouble as you ever will.
Besides, you owe it to me.
You sort of belong to me.
When you were a hobo, I found you.
- Piffle.
- Please.
- It's absolutely out of the question.
- I'll throw you in the water.
You'd take my mind off my work.
The big director that has all the girls panting for him.
- I tell you...
- I'll follow you.
I'll tell everybody who you are, like a kid sister.
You'll follow me?
Yes, I'll follow you, and I'll holler, " This guy's a phony.
"This is Sullivan, the big director from Hollywood... a phonus-balonus, a faker, a heel... "
If I may join in the controversy, sir,
I think the young lady's suggestion an excellent one.
- You may not join in the controversy.
- I will, I will, I will!
- I'm going with you!
- You'll do nothing of the kind.
Would you get me some tramp clothes, Mr. Burrows?
Certainly, Miss.
Certainly.
Go down to the station and get me a ticket to...
- Where do you live?
- I won't tell you. I won't be sent home.
You stop that! Now, stop that!
Grab her feet!
Oh! Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Certainly, sir.
Now, miss... Now, miss...
Stop it, please, miss!
I won't be sent home!
- Let go of me!
- Oh, my!
Mr. Burrows...
This way, Mr. Burrows.
There we are.
Now, one, two, three... Pull hard!
Hello, Information?
Have you any freight trains... going east this afternoon or early this evening?
Thank you very much, sir.
Oh, and could you tell me, does that train carry tramps, and if so, where do they get on?
What? It's on page two.
- What did you say?
- Tramps.
How would you like to take a flying... Wise guy.
Yes, sir?
What was that again?
I said I wonder if you'd be kind enough to settle a bet for us.
Just a few of us here at the club.
If a tramp were to board your 5:48 this afternoon, from where would he board it?
I see. I see. Yes... but not within the yard limits.
I think that gives me the complete picture.
Thank you very much for your trouble.
Oh, and by the way, I win.
Good day.
A different approach to the same problem.
I think this is it, sir.
Why don't you go back with the car.
You look about as much like a boy as Mae West.
All right, they'll think I'm your frail.
I believe it's called a "beazel," miss, if memory serves.
- Good-bye, Burrows. See you in a couple of weeks. - Good-bye.
May I close, sir, by warning you against the entire expedition, which I envision with deep apprehension...
- and gloomy foreboding.
- Thanks. Same to you.
Come on.
Jump!
Come on. Here.
I'll help you.
- Let me up!
- I've got you!
- We made it!
- Yeah.
Amateurs.
Phew!
Oh. How do you do?
- Beautiful weather.
- If it doesn't rain.
How do you feel about the labor situation?
Where are you going?
I hope we didn't disturb you.
- Very interesting couple.
- Yeah.
- Do you smell anything?
- I certainly do.
- What does it smell like to you?
- Hogs.
- That's what I was afraid of.
- I'm getting hungry.
How can you possibly be hungry when you just ate?
I'm not a scientist.
All I know is I'm hungry.
You'd better tell the porter to close the window.
I didn't ask you to come along in the first place. Now that you're...
Don't start baking wise cracks.
- Dough, sir.
- Blasted draft in here, at that.
- Where is this train going?
- I don't know.
- How long does it take to get there?
- I didn't ask you to come along.
I think that's a perfectly reasonable question.
Haven't you got enough imagination to pretend we're broke, hungry, homeless, drifting in despair?
Let's just sit here and try to feel like a couple of tramps.
- Cold?
- I'll be all right.
- It's the desert.
- I'll be all right.
As soon as this blasted thing comes to a town someplace,
I'll send for a car and have you taken home.
This is a lot of "hokey-palokey. "
This is a terrible way to travel, with a girl.
It's better with a girl than without one. You would have frozen to death.
If I go back, will you go back with me?
- Dodsense.
- Then I won't go back, either.
You're so simple, you're apt to get into trouble.
Why do you think I'm here?
Gee, I like that about you.
You're like those knights of old, who used to ride around looking for trouble.
- Who was it who rode on a pure white horse?
- Lady Godiva.
She must have been a nut. I bet her husband was sore. Are you jealous?
Why don't you shut up and try to get some sleep.
- Will you go to sleep too?
- I'll try.
Why don't you try counting the hogs jumping over a hedge?
Listen, short britches...
- What's that?
- Nothing. Just me.
- What?
- I sneezed.
- You what?
- I...
- I sneezed.
- Oh, you poor darling.
- Have you got hay fever?
- I think it's hog fever.
Oh, you poor lamb.
It'll be alright as soon as the sun gets a little warmer.
Are you hungry?
You got me doing it.
- Have we got any eating money?
- Ten cents.
Can we spend it for breakfast, or are you saving it for something?
Look, I've already told you,
I'll send for a car for you and...
I can't help it if I'm good-natured.
I like to be with you, and it puts me in a good humor.
You take lots of girls and made them sleep in a hog sty all night, and then didn't tell them where their breakfast was coming from... the next morning, they wouldn't take it lying down.
We'll find some breakfast somewhere.
- In some swill pail, I suppose.
- What do the other bubs do?
They steal chickigs... chickens. and they roast them over campfires... with baked potatoes and green corn on the cob...
- with melted butter...
- Shut up!
- Where do they get the butter?
- They steal it.
Well, they don't.
It isn't as easy as all that.
There's a lot of suffering in this world...
- that ordinary people don't know anything about.
- Now what's the matter?
- I'm hungry.
Well...
Hey, there's a town up ahead.
Let's get off and see what happens.
- What town is it?
- I don't know. I suppose it's Hollywood.
Look, there's a lunch stand.
Come on.
Come on. I can't keep running along here all day.
Here I come. Just a minute.
Well, come on.
- Did I hurt you any?
- Well, you didn't do me any good.
Come on.
A cup of coffee and sinker for one.
I never eat till noon.
It gives me indigestion.
- Just make that two coffees.
- That'll be ten cents.
That's all right.
It's right here someplace.
- Holy Boses.
- What's the matter?
I must have spent it at that owl wagon.
- I'll never get rich.
- Oh, gee.
You're a little richer than you were.
Hundreds of miles from everything, cut off from the world, a taste of human kindness.
I'll never forget it as long as I live.
What town is this?
- Las Vegas, Nevada.
- Las Vegas, Nevada. This is the busy...
- Las Vegas! You mean Las Vegas?
- What about it?
Is there a land yacht waiting here?
Land yacht?
You mean that thing?
That's perfectly wonderful,
Mr. Sullivan.
I rejoice in your experience.
- And where does this gentleman live?
- Just up there by the tracks.
- Give him $100. Never mind who from.
- That's swell.
- A great human-interest story.
- It'll probably ruin him.
He'll give turkey dinners to every slug that comes in... and never hit the jackpot again.
All right, all right.
Buy the kid here a few clothes,
and meet me in Kansas City, someplace near the station.
I'm going the hard way.
So long, gang.
Just a minute, please.
Sit down!
- But listen, Doc!
- You listen.
It's three days in bed, minimum.
This is just a cold shot.
You won't even feel it.
Yow!
- I haven't time to spend three days in bed.
- You'll take the time.
You'll get to Kansas City just as soon, and you can imagine... that you went there on your cow snatcher, or whatever you used.
What have you got an imagination for?
- Here's something for you.
- What's that?
It's Christmas. So long.
Come in!
Here's a wrapper for you and some slippers.
- What?
- A wrapper.
Oh, thanks.
There's some makeup in the medicine cabinet.
- Thanks. I can use it.
- You sure can.
Yes, sir, Mr. LeBrand, he's in the next room taking a little snooze.
He looks great. This whole thing is doing him a power of good.
- Come in.
- Hello. Feel better?
No, I'm sore. There's nothing the matter with me but a little fever.
Even if I did get sick, they could've sent me to some free hospital.
Wherever they send you.
It would have been very interesting.
They give you a nice free burial too, at Potter's Field.
"Free burial. " Why does everybody exaggerate everything so much?
I've got a little cold in my head.
You take a dose of salts, and there you are.
- It's because you're a very valuable man.
- Bushwah.
- You make very lovely pictures.
- Phooey.
- Well, you do.
- It's a funny thing, how everything... keeps shoving me back to Hollywood or Beverly Hills...
Or this monstrosity we're riding in... almost like gravity.
As if some force were saying,
"Get back where you belong.
You don't belong out here in real life, you phony, you. "
You're a little feverish.
Maybe there's a universal law that says, " Stay put.
As you are, so shall you remain. "
Maybe that's why tramps are always in trouble.
They don't vote.
They don't pay taxes.
They violate the law of nature.
You look very pretty in that outfit.
Maybe that's why they don't want trailer colonies.
- Or am I getting a bit profound?
- You're getting a bit hot.
Your hand is very cool.
But nothing is going stop me...
I'm going to find out how it feels to be in trouble, without friends, without credit, without checkbook, without name... alone.
- And I'll go with you.
- How can I be alone if you're with me?
Yes, sir, Mr. LeBrand.
It's all finished. the greatest expedition of modern times, almost the greatest sacrifice ever made by human man.
- Good morning, Joseph.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
He's all washed up, except tonight he's going through for a quick tour.
He's taking $1,000 in $5.00 bills... and he's going to hand them out to these tramps in gratitude for what they done for him.
Now is that a story? Does that give you a lump in your throat, or does that give you a lump in your throat?
- Hello.
- Hello. Tired?
No, no.
I was just thinking.
Well, here we are at the end of the adventure.
I'll go down tonight and give them a little money, and that winds it up.
Now, what do you want to do?
Do you want to go home or take another crack at Hollywood?
- Well, I...
- with a nice, fat letter to Lubitsch?
I'd sort of like to... go where you go.
I mean, I'd sort of hoped that you'd...
Well, I mean, that you'd want us to go on together a little longer, now that we kind of got used to each other.
- Of course I would, if I wasn't married.
- Who's married?
Didn't you know that? I thought everyone had heard of my misfortune.
- Of course I didn't.
- What do you mean?
As if I'd snatched you away from your loving grandmother.
- Are you in love with her?
- That vulture?
- Then why did you marry her?
- Income tax.
- Income tax?
- It was supposed to save me $24,000 a year.
It's what's called a joint return.
It's California law.
Each one pays half, and the total is less than the aggregate surtax, so the surtax is less than the something or other.
It was an idea of my business manager's.
- I think it's disgusting.
- It wasn't supposed to be romantic.
It was supposed to save me
$12,000 a year, but it didn't.
Turned out she couldn't live on $12,000 a year.
Good.
- Lovely. She had to have $24,000.
- Good.
Don't keep saying "good" all the time, or I'll poke you in the nose.
- Good.
- Now, listen.
So I demanded the divorce she'd promised me.
And she told you to go fry an egg.
She said it would break her mother's heart.
Some fine advice your business manager gave you.
I found out why.
He was getting half.
- And you really can't get a divorce ever?
- Never.
You can't get a divorce without collusion, and she won't collude.
I guess
I ought to go home, then.
You could still have that letter to Lubitsch.
Could I still come and push you in the pool sometimes?
- Of course you could.
- I guess that's better than nothing.
There, there, there.
My gracious.
Here are the $5.00 bills,
Mr. Sullivan.
Hello, Johnnie.
Get me two tickets on the midnight plane.
Two tickets? Oh, two tickets!
Yes, indeed, Mr. Sullivan.
- They're pretty, aren't they?
- Uh-huh.
- Do you want one?
- Yes.
Here. You can have two of them.
Did you cancel the plane tickets?
They cancel themselves. I'm gonna give him just 15 minutes more, and then...
I'm sure he's all right.
He probably got interested in a revival meeting or something and...
Hello? Yes, Doc.
Not in the hospitals, huh?
Sure. I guess that's all you can do.
Anyway, he didn't have an accident.
Oh?
He isn't, huh?
Val has covered the police stations.
- Okay.
- I guess you can come back now.
I should have gone with him.
I knew he'd get into trouble without me.
- I told him that...
- I'll gonna give him just 12 minutes more,
Then I'm gonna lay it in LeBrand's lap and let him figure it out.
- Sully'll be awfully sore if you...
- Let him be sore.
I got a job too, you know.
If LeBrand ever found out...
He came back the last time.
He didn't have reservations on a plane or people waiting.
- You don't know him like I know him.
- Is that so?
I guess I know him better than...
- Yeah?
- Say, I'm down here to the morgue.
They got a guy in a basket.
You can't tell who he is.
Did the boss have any identification?
Did he have any identification that you know of?
Well, he had...
I think he said he had... Who is that?
- Have they found him?
- Take it easy. We gotta check everywhere.
- What identification did he have?
- In the soles of his shoes...
I think there was a card between the soles of his shoes.
Look in the soles of his shoes, between the leather.
He's coming now.
I can hear his footsteps.
There's a card here. It's kind of hard to read. It's all splattered.
- He's dead? What do you mean, he's dead?
- What do you think it means?
What do you send him on jobs like this for? I've got a good mind to sue you.
Do you think I like it any better than you do?
I will sue you!
I'll teach you to... Operator?
Operator, I was talking with Kansas City.
She's gonna sue me.
I suppose I ought to fire the whole bunch of you.
Somehow I don't feel like firing anybody.
Well, there's no use your hanging around here!
Get your things together and leave this afternoon!
- I'll fly back.
- Yes, sir! Uh...
I'd like you to come with us, my dear.
Jones has explained to me.
You were his last discovery... his last gift to the world.
We'll take care of you always.
She didn't hear you.
- What's the idea, riding into the yard?
- Huh?
I said, what's the idea, riding into the freight yard?
Lay off, will you?
I've got a good mind to run you in for trespassing.
Shut up, you dumb cluck.
Can't you see I'm sick?
Come on, get out of here, you dirty rat!
- Go on, go on!
- Don't do that again.
- That's telling him, 'bo.
- Don't do what again?
Come on. Come on, get going!
Trespass. Resisting arrest.
Atrocious assault and battery with intent to kill.
Huh? What?
- What did he say?
- We object, Your Honor.
My client had been injured and denies all knowledge.
Objection overruled.
- Trespass and resisting arrest.
- Object, your honor.
The man was a railroad employee, not an officer of the law.
- Sustained.
- Trespass and atrocious assault.
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Objection overruled.
Get down to business.
Prisoner at the bar.
Prisoner at the bar!
- Answer when you're spoken to.
- Huh?
- Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
- Huh?
Guilty or not guilty to trespass and atrocious assault... with a rock upon the person of the employee of the railroad.
I guess I hit him, all right, the way my hand feels.
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.
I'll pay any damages you like.
Sorry.
So you still refuse to give your name?
It'll come back to me in a minute.
I have such an awful headache.
I'm all mixed up.
We plead guilty, Your Honor, with extenuating circumstances... due to temporary insanity, and throw ourselves on the mercy of the court.
Huh? What?
What did he say?
Stand up. Stand up!
Stand up.
Prisoner at the bar, these are parlous times, and we have no desire to be severe.
- Just a minute. I...
- Silence!
When confronted with violence and hoodlumism, the court has no alternative.
Since you still refuse to remember your name...
but have pleaded guilty to trespass and atrocious assault,
I will be as lenient as my conscience permits... and not impose upon you the maximum penalty your crimes ordinarily permit.
Richard Roe, I sentence you to six years at hard labor...
as prescribed by the laws of our sovereign state.
Six years? What's he talking about?
- You got off easy.
- Wait a minute. I gotta get to a phone.
- I have to send a...
- Come on.
- Wait a minute. I'm all mixed up!
- Come on, come on!
Mister, new man.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hi, Jake.
- Put him in 13.
- Just a minute, boys. I want to...
You speak when you're spoken to around here. Hold up your arm and wait.
Listen, you...
You say "Mister" when you're talking to me.
- Put him in 13 and find him a bunk.
- Come on.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Them cost me $16.50.
- Another Richard Roe, eh?
- There seems to be a lot of them.
- How's everything at the house, Charlie?
- Fine, Jake.
- Give my regards to the missus.
- I'll do that little thing.
- I gotta get out of here.
- Take it easy, boy.
I'm John L. Sullivan, a Hollywood director.
Somebody slugged me. I gotta get out of here.
A Hollywood what?
- Take it easy, will you?
You're gonna lose your privilege.
No letters, no smokes, no writing.
You don't want that.
I want a lawyer.
You get me to a telephone.
There's a telephone right down there.
They can't do things like this to people. Put 'em in a pigsty.
Pipe down, will you, please, before he hears.
I want a lawyer. I demand my right to have a lawyer!
Did you hear that?
He demands a lawyer.
You starting in again?
You're gonna be here a long time, see?
And you gotta learn, and learn quick.
Chain him in.
No privilege, fresh guy.
We're going to the picture show Sunday.
Good news. You want to see the picture show Sunday?
We're going to the picture show.
We're going to the picture show Sunday.
They asked us over again.
- When can I write a letter?
- When you get your privilege back.
How long will that take?
That all depends on the Mister.
He's all right if you take it nice and quiet.
How long does it take him to make up his mind?
Take it easy, will you, or you'll never get it.
Look out!
Who gave you leave to read the paper?
You won't learn, huh?
- It's about me. I just happened to see it.
- Shut up!
Turn around. Turn around!
Put your hands behind you.
- Put him in the sweat box.
- For how long, Mister?
- Till I tell you. Are you gonna start now?
- No. Yes. I mean no, sir.
Then get moving!
Get back to your work. What do you think this is, a vaudeville show?
Tastes good, don't it?
I'll try to get him to let you off early.
I ain't supposed to do this.
- Water.
- You'll be all right.
You got to learn, that's all.
It ain't so easy at first, but after a while you don't mind.
We ain't so bad off.
He ain't bad, according to his lights.
He has to deal with some pretty tough hombres.
He got us chicken last Thanksgiving... and some turkey once for Christmas.
And there ain't another Mister takes his gang to the picture show.
Maybe... Maybe if I ask him, he'll let you go the picture show Sunday.
Wouldn't that be something? Huh?
All right, Charlie.
Let it down easy, Charlie.
Charlie's a little anxious.
Brothers and sisters, once again we're gonna have a little entertainment.
I don't have to tell you what it is.
The sheet kind of gives it away.
And once again, brothers and sisters, we're going to share our pleasure... with some neighbors less fortunate than ourselves.
Won't you please clear the first three pews so they may have seats.
And when they get here,
I'm gonna ask you once more, neither by word, nor by action, nor by look... to make our guests feel unwelcome.
Don't draw away from them or act high-toned.
- For we is all equal in the sight of God.
- Amen!
And He said,
"Let him who is without sin...
" cast the first stone.
"The chains shall be struck from them!
"The lame shall leap.
"The blind shall see!
And glory in the coming of the Lord. "
Let's give our guests a little welcome.

Will those nearest to the lights kindly rise and dim them, please.
How do?
- Hey.
- Huh?
Am I laughing?
You don't suppose this is a gag, do you?
He'd have to be a Houdini to get out of that one.
Well, I wouldn't put it past him.
Don't you understand?
They think I'm dead, and I'm not dead.
Well, that's fine.
Just think what a nice surprise they'll have when you get out.
I haven't time to spend six years.
- But you were sentenced.
- I know that, but I still haven't time.
Well, you'll have to find the time.
Look they don't sentence picture directors to a place like this... for a little disagreement with a yard bull.
- Don't they?
- No.
Oh.
Well, then, maybe you ain't a movie director.
Huh?
Maybe that idea just come to you...
- when you got hit on the head, maybe.
- Now, look...
We used to have a fella here once that thought he was Lindbergh.
He used to fly away every night... but he was always back in the morning.
Don't I look like a picture director?
'Course I never seen one.
You look more like a soda jerk, or maybe a plasterer, maybe.
But...
If ever a plot need a twist, this one does.
Huh?
- I gotta get my picture in the paper.
- That would be swell.
Then you could paste it over your bunk.
What kind of people get their pictures in the paper?
Ball players?
Girls? They take 'em with their legs crossed.
I cut one out once. She had a...
She was sitting... No?
When you die, if you was important enough.
I've had that.
Murderers?
There was a swell picture of a friend of mine.
He was a lodge brother.
They called him
"the blowtorch killer. "
That's it. That's it!
You tell the Mister I'm ready to make a full confession.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Come on.
- Now, take it easy.
- There isn't a moment to lose.
- Now, look...
- I'm... My conscience has got me.
You're gonna get...
I want to confess to the murder of John L. Sullivan.
- Wait a minute!
- I killed John L. Sullivan!
I killed John L.
Sullivan!
I'm telling you, you're doing the wrong thing.
- I'm a murderer!
- Will you listen to me before somebody...
I killed John L. Sullivan!
- I'm so happy.
- So am I!
- I said, I'm so happy!
- What?
Your wife got married last week.
Who got buried last week?
She got married last week!
My wife?
You say they buried her?
No, she got married.
She married your business manager.
- She married him?
- Yes!
- He married her?
- Yes!
- But how?
- Because you were dead.
- Dead?
- Dead.
- Do you suppose she'll give you a divorce?
- Give it to me?
She'll beg me for it. Don't you understand? She's got to give it to me.
Otherwise it's bigamy, unfaithfulness, alienation of affection, corpus delicti.
- And then you'll be free.
- Then I'll be free.
But not for long, I hope.
Just a moment, gentlemen!
Sully, I just want to tell you that
O Brother, Where Art Thou? is gonna be the greatest tragedy ever made.
- Well, I...
- The world will weep! Humanity will sob.
It'll put Shakespeare back with the shipping news.
Quiet! Your personal courage, your sacrifice... the lengths to which you went to sample the bitter dregs of vicissitude...
will make O Brother, Where Art Thou? positively...
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.
- You're sorry to disappoint me?
Yes, and I say it with some embarrassment,
but I don't want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?
You don't want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?
No. I say it with some embarrassment.
I want to make a comedy.
You say it with some embarrassment?
He doesn't want to make O Brother, Where
Art Thou? He wants to make a comedy.
He don't mean that, boss.
He's still a little stir crazy.
- Oh, yes, I do. Oh, no I'm not!
- You're joking, aren't you?
- It's in bad taste, but it's a joke?
- No.
But it's had more publicity than the Johnstown flood.
- What are we gonna do?
- Oh, brother.
Why don't you want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou, Sully?
In the first place, I'm too happy to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
In the second place, I haven't suffered enough to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
- You haven't suffered enough?
- He hasn't suffered enough?
- But Sully!
- I'll tell you something else.
There's a lot to be said for making people laugh.
Did you know that's all some people have?
It isn't much, but it's better than nothing in this cockeyed caravan.
Boy.
Subtitles by KV on Subtitle Workshop - 2009
Great day in the morning.
- Have mercy on the cotton.
Halley's Comet, Halley's Comet.
What they calls the name?
Halley? Who's she?
Halley's the man what conjured it up there, I reckon.
Halley done seen it first.
Judge Clemens, how do we know that thing won't set the world on fire?
We know about it because it comes back every 75 years.
Think of it as kind of a Jubilee in heaven.
Like a possum-hunt?
- Well, like a camp-meeting in Heaven.
Judge Clemens .. come quick.
They want you down home.
It's done happened.
Jane, darling.
John .. it's a boy.
- A boy .. oh ..
Well sir .. this is the night.
Can you see that other comet, son?
I reckon that big comet must have come out the very minute this child was born.
Like as if it brung him from somewhere clean out of the world.
I suppose people all over the country are looking at that comet tonight.
And not one soul of them has ever heard of little Samuel Langhorne Clemens.
Young man .. that's you.
"Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted."
"Persons attempting to find a moral, will be banished."
"Persons attempting to find a plot .. will be shot."
"By order of .. Mark .. Twain."
That is me you just saw, a little bit ago.
I came a little ahead of schedule.
Maybe that was due to the comet.
When I arrived, I hadn't any hair, I hadn't any teeth, I hadn't any clothes.
But it was alright then.
Because I didn't know that I should have been embarrassed.
I've learnt since, to my sorrow, that
Man is the only animal that blushes.
Or needs to.
In fact .. I blush a little now as I look back.
Some things a man doesn't like to tell about himself unless he gets ..
Beyond the grave, as they say.
But now I can tell the truth, the whole truth and ..
Well that is .. within limits.
You see, truth is a very valuable thing.
And I believe we should be a little .. economical with it.
Well .. I was born under the comet.
Now that's the truth.
And I grew up in the village of Hannibal, Missouri.
That's the truth.
I think the village contained a hundred people.
"And I increased the population by one percent."
"That's more than some of the best men in history have done for a town."
"Life unfolded gently there."
"And the Mississippi was more important than the Seven Seas."
"Right in the middle of it was Jackson's Island."
"It was the lair of as bloodthirsty a mob of pirates as ever scuttled a ship."
"There was Tom, the terror of the seas."
"And Huckleberry the red-handed."
"And our slave-boy Jim.
The avenger of the Picaroons."
"And here were built the long, low luggers that plowed the Spanish Main."
"The others supplied the labour, and I supplied the imagination."
Hurry men, hurry! Those buccaneers will beat us to the treasure.
They ain't nothing but white-trash on a raft.
That's Captain Kid and his pirates in disguise.    - What?
That's the doggonest thing going on.
Where are my sailors at?
"We rescued many a beauteous maiden and made many a villain walk the plank."
"And of course, we gave our spoils to the poor."
It's a Galleon, men.
Get ready to board her!
Master Sam, we can't get on a Steamboat.
And if we does, they'll fling us off.
"But pirating was only secondary."
"It was the river that held us."
"The broad, majestic river with its lazy current and its soft, cool mud."
"Its Steamboats were our dreams of luxury."
"Their Pilots were our Gods."
Gosh fellahs, "The Big Missouri".
And look at the Pilot up there.
Running the whole business.
"I clung to the river until the last, precious moment of the day."
"Then I had to give up my life of crime and go home."
"I used to shinny up the porch roof and in a window."
"I got so I could do it in record time."
"I suppose most boys have tried to fool their mothers."
"I used to try to fool mine."
[ Snoring noise ]
[ Snoring noise ]
Sam.
Sam, you needn't play possum.
I heard you come in.
[ Snoring noise ]
Time to get up, Ma?
You know perfectly well I ought to tan you, Sam Clemens.
Do you realize that ..
For four life-long hours I hadn't known whether you were alive or drowned.
Oh Ma, I'll never get drownded.
Well, I reckon it's as you were born to hang, like all the other river riffraff.
Nothing ever happens around this old town, except on the river.
The river. I wish I'd never heard of that river.
Once that Mississippi mud gets into you Sam, it never gets out.
All that's left me in my life is to try to make you into a fine, cultured man.
Looked up to and respected.
Like your father was.
I reckon that river is too much for me.
Gosh, Ma.
Why don't you try once more, to help Orion in the printing shop?
Just during your vacations so that you'll stay out of trouble.
Won't you try, son?
And maybe someday you'll learn to be a Printer.
Alright, Ma .. I'll try.
"After 3 years in that print shop, I was ready to change places with a convict."
"And pay him a bonus."
"I was pretty well discouraged."
"My brother Orion was more discouraged."
Shush. Quiet Rock.
- Sam.
Now what have I done?
- My stars almighty.
It seems to me the past 3 years would have taught you to do something right.
Seth Peters paid his subscription today with 2 bushels of large, yellow "bears".
"Pears" you dunce. Not "bears"!
[ Singing ]
"Nobody knows the trouble I've seen."
"Nobody knows but .. Jesus."
Come on! The Steamboat is coming!
Steamboat is coming, Sam.
I guess you're not in much of a hurry.
There's seven hours work on that floor. You dunderhead.
If only somebody invented a machine that would set type by itself.
He'd make ten million dollars.
And I'd pay half.
Clemens! I won't stand for this.
Well, I'm sure I don't understand,
Mr Higgins.        - Look at that.
"Last Tuesday, Mr Higgins, editor of The Bugle, out-stood as a hero .."
"When he single-handed rescued his self from drowning his self."
Why, I never saw ..
"His sweetheart left him high and dry."
"So he waded out in the river to end his sorrows."
"When his soundings showed he couldn't drown without getting in over his head."
"He turned around and waded out, and is in our midst again."
This is serious. Fighting serious!
Mr Higgins sir, I swear I never set eyes on that item before in my life.
Do you mean to say ..?
Holy suffering Jehoshaphat!
Taking you by-and-large, Sam Clemens.
You do seem to be more different kinds of an ass than I ever saw before.
Why I ever took you aboard beats me.
Where are you taking her now?
- I wished I was dead.
One thing you got to have Sam Clemens if you're going to be a River-Pilot ..
And that's a memory.
You can't think you know this river.
You got to know you know it.
Yes sir.
That's Angel's Point over yonder.
There's shallow water by that the cotton mill.
And that's the Harrison plantation on that bluff.
Stop that!
- Yes sir.
Water less twain.
Look out, look out .. don't hug that slick place. There ain't six feet there.
She won't stand it, she begins this minute. Look sharp I tell you!
Seven feet.
Look out, look out.
Oh blazes .. there you go!
Turn her down .. snatch her, snatch her!
Pull up your starboard wheel, quick. Ship up the back!
Let go of that whistle-cord.
What are you doing up there?
You remember what I told you about those bluff reefs?
What did I say?
- I don't know, sir.
You don't know? Now look here, why do you think I told you all that stuff?
To be entertaining, I thought, sir.
To be ..?
Get out of this Pilot House.
Get off this boat!
Dive overboard! Kill yourself! Anything!
Get out of here before you sink us all.
Come back here.
I said I'd learn you the river.
And when I tell a man I'll learn him the river, I'll learn him if it kills him.
Take the wheel.
Take it.
Hold her steady now.
She'll pull through.
Mark .. twain.
Safe water .. mark .. twain.
Well, there's one call you'll never forget so long as you live, boy.
Mark twain .. safe water.
Many a night of storm and fog, when you're trying to go on through.
You'll be straining your ears to hear that call.
The welcome-est sound in all the world to a river-man.
Is those two words .. "mark twain".
"I remembered Bixby all these years."
"I don't see why he didn't drown me."
"He must have been a good teacher."
"Because, after a while I WAS a Pilot."
"And I was beginning what I suppose a man must call his .. 'real life'."
Sam .. uh .. Mr Clemens.
Now here's a thing, you take this rock sample. I've been trying to tell you ..
The one hundredth time.
- No, this is a different kind of rock.
Look, Clemens, if I didn't think so much of you I wouldn't argue you into this.
Steve Gillis, why don't you try to do right?
It would please an awful lot of people.
And astonish the rest.
This rock's no good. It's got a rotten streak in it.
Why that's silver you jug-head.
- It is?
Sure, the mountain is just busting with it.
So why would you go to seed on the river when you can go out West and get rich?
Steve, it isn't that I don't believe you but ..
What does a River-Pilot want with a million?
I'm telling you a man wouldn't know this river lately.
Ed's rushing West.
I don't suppose a man lives who can stand prosperity. Other people's I mean.
Fifty thousand longhorns by way of the Cross-Timbers.
All down and around she goes.
I tell you boys, the whole town is built on a mountain of silver.
If you don't do this, you'll regret it all the rest of your life.
I know you'll be with me. So, I get the assayer's report and that will prove it.
Alright gentlemen, keep your eye on the ace of spades.
There you are gentlemen.
Who wants to try?
I'll take this one.
Sorry, now watch closely.
It's all very simple.
Incredible. Permitting themselves to be robbed like that.
Sorry.
We give a chance and you take it.
If at first you don't succeed, you ..
Cough up.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Come on, quick.
Now the rest of it.
Can I help Mr Clemens?
Too bad we haven't got a cure for this man's manners. Maybe drowning will help.
Alright, cast off.
Ain't these yours?
- What?
Why yes, I believe they are.
Oh, there is something else.
Thank you. I think that's mine also.
Yeah .. yeah.
I suppose she's your ..
- My sister.
Good .. I mean of course, of course.
Glad to have met you, sir.
Thank you, sir .. oh Mr Clemens.
Try again?
Mr Clemens.
- Yes, sir?
Well, I'm indebted to you.
My name is Charles Langdon.
"Langdon"?
Have you ever been to a
Pilot House? Well come up later.
I'm .. I'm going to give the boys a little surprise.
A surprise?
The shellbacks on here would jump this boat if they knew what's coming tonight.
Can I ..
Can I see that again?
- I beg your pardon?
Nothing, nothing .. just let it go.
Change your luck with the other diners.
Step right up and round she goes.
A passenger in the Pilot
House is kind of special.
Those are Pilots back there. Not on duty. They're just studying the river.
This fog is getting thicker and thicker.
- Should have tied up an hour ago.
Oh, you know it yourself.
If he's dead set to wreck her
I want to see it from here.
On account of the view.
Think your sister would be interested ..
- Do Pilots have to study?
We never do anything else.
This river takes up all our time.
And how old did you say your sister was?
Look here. The Captain tells me you're going to tie up short of Hat Island.
You bet your gizzard he's going to tie up.
You think he wants to knock the boat's brains out?
I've got to pick up 80 tons of buffalo hide in St Joe.           - You will.
No Pilot ever ran into Hat Island in the fog and no Pilot ever will.
Now you get out of here.
Pretty bad Mr Clemens.
I think we'd better tie up.
I'll tell you when I want to tie up.
Put out those torch-baskets.
Put out those torch-baskets!
Put out them fires. Get those lights out! Hurry .. chop-chop!
I suppose in the case of a girl like your sister ..
It's getting pretty hard to see the river, isn't it?     - Oh no.
The trick is to guess which is the wet part.
It seems wide enough.
- Of course, a mile wide on the surface.
But underneath it's one long mass of shoals, barbs and snags.
For 1,200 miles of river.
You must know where each one is within 2 feet. And they move position over night.
You can't think you know this river, you've got to know you know it.
No, really?
Learn 1,200 miles of river ..
This is the first time in seven years
Sam's told the plain, undecorated truth.
And that young fellow doesn't believe a word he said.
You mean you never heard of these things?
You'll have to forgive my ignorance, Mr Clemens but ..
I'm afraid there are millions of people who know even less about it than I do.
I never took no stock in the notion that people wasn't the same everywhere.
We all speak the same language.
[ Ship's horn. Loud. ]
Shut up you blasted fool! Steer around.
You stupid, dunderheaded, flea-brained, river-hog!
Why, you ornery, numbskull, rapscallion, mud-cat, rascal!
Serves you right!
Put a light on the worm-eaten brush-pile.
So a man can see you of a night.
What was I saying about language?
I notice you keep looking back.
Oh that. Well ..
That's on account of the alligators.
Alligators?
Oh, you run into them?
No, no. They grab on to the stern of the boat.
If there's one thing an alligator loves more than another, it's to hitch a ride.
Hitch a ride?
- Uhuh.
Of course, just a few alligators hanging on behind aren't so bad.
The boat can stand some drag.
But then the next alligator grabs on to the first one's tail and then ..
Another one grabs onto him, until you're pulling a whole chain of alligators.
You've really seen this thing?
- Nearly every trip.
Why, I've struggled up this river dragging a mass of alligators ..
A mile long and ten alligators wide.
Really?
- Uhuh.
A whole crock of overgrown lies I've ever heard in my life.
And that the young fellow believes.
Thank heaven, there's the foot of
Hat Island. He'll have to tie up.
I couldn't have stood no more.
Sam, see you below in the Texas.
Aye-aye Captain.
Mark three on the starboard.
Mark three on the starboard.
Wade, ain't he gone past his landing?
Do you suppose any man alive is fool enough to run that island in this soup?
Standby below.
Half twain.
Starboard.
Half twain, starboard.
Call Bixby and the others.
They've ain't never seen nothing like this and never will again.
Down below, pile up a head of steam down there. I want everything you got.
You've tied the safety-valve down, sir.
- What?
If this gauge goes any higher,
I don't want to be looking at it.
Well, hang your hat on the gauge.
When it blows upon the railroad, there you is.
When it blows upon a
Steamboat, where is you?
He'll never make it.
You're the man that taught him.
- I didn't teach him this.
Sam, you'll never get her through.
- Then I'll get her half through, twice.
Quarter less twain .. starboard.
Quarter less twain .. starboard.
Stand by .. get ready now.
I hope he knows what he's doing.
I've run this river nigh on 20 years,
Captain. I never saw a man try this.
Half twain on larboard.
Half twain on the starboard.
By Jove .. the stern is coming down just exactly right.
He's over the first reef.
Seven feet, starboard.
Seven feet, starboard.
Six feet larboard.
Six feet larboard.
She's groaning. Going to six feet.
She's feeling it now.
- We'll never make it.
Nine feet starboard.
Nine feet starboard.
Eight and half feet larboard.
Eight and half feet larboard.
Seven feet starboard.
Seven feet starboard.
Six feet larboard.
Six feet larboard.
The sounding is off .. grounding!
Now let her have it.
Every ounce you got!
Grounding .. grounding larboard.
Grounding larboard!
Pull her hard down! Slash her.
Slash her.
Mark twain .. safe water.
Mark twain ..
Beautiful job, Sam.
- I never expected to see that.
Sam Clemens never did anything like he was expected to in his life.
The old Mississippi done found her boss.
[ Singing: ]
"The Pilot is a mighty man."
"The Pilot is a mighty man.
The Pilot is a mighty man."
"The boat was stuck in the river mud .. the Pilot made his plea."
"Let me drive this boat like I know
I did, when the ark moved on the sea."
"When the ark moved on the sea."
"High water or low water."
"The Pilot is a mighty man.
Yeah, the Pilot is a mighty man."
I never saw such thick weather in my life.
The other Pilots are saying it was the most ..
What do you people call it?
Oh, "lightening" bit of piloting ever seen on the river.
I'm glad it suited them.
Because that was my last run.
It was your what?
I'm leaving the river.
You're joking.
Well yes it is a joke, in a way.
All my life, everybody's been trying to tell me this river was only a ..
Wet streak in the dirt.
A wet street?
- Yep.
My parents .. my brothers .. everybody.
They broke their hearts trying to tell me.
But oh no, I wouldn't listen.
Clemens, if ever I saw a man well-fitted for his job and ..
And perfectly happy in that job, you were he.
Why, there's nothing in the world happier than a frog in the mud.
But you know a ..
Frog can only see about eight feet.
I wonder what would happen if a frog saw a star?
It would kill him, probably.
He'd need a drink, probably.
I didn't realize there was anything a river man could never have.
It will take time .. I'll need money.
I'll head West first.
They're building a new country out there
Langdon. I aim to have a crack at it.
Of all the .. I can't imagine what's come over you.
I can tell you but you won't believe me.
It wouldn't be possible for you to believe me.     - Yes?
You see that picture of your sister there, Langdon?
Yes.
That's the girl I'm going to marry.
We're almost there. Come on Beulah.
Beulah, come on, do as
I ask .. come on Beulah.
Beulah .. Beulah.
Oyster on the larboard, Steve.
She's hard-grounded.
Beulah.
I'm going to learn you.
- That reef's got her amidships.
Beulah.
Beulah, now don't aggravate me.
It's no use, Steve.
She's took root worse than a Jeff Davis democrat.
Yeah, we might as well locate here.
- Yeah.
That looks like a creek bottom there, so you just as well start hauling water.
What for?
We got to wash the gold out of this gravel you lunk-head.
Too bad Beulah didn't balk where we could have flumed the water.
We need about a million gallons.
A million?
Why you rapscallion, flea-brained, numb- skulled, dunderheaded, gully hopping ..
Mississippi methods.
They work too.
- Yeah.
For a minute.
I sure think we're coming to something, Sam.
Sam!
Hey Steve.
Steve.
I can't find it.
What in the name of time are you doing down there?
I'm getting rich out West.
Here, take this.
Well, I've found out what a mine is, anyway.
It's a hole in the ground with a darned fool at the end of it.
Some old tunnel runs right under here.
- Well, maybe we can dig a way round it.
What's an abandoned tunnel doing there if there's any gold in it?
They missed the seam, that's all.
- Yeah, well I'm finished, that's all.
Oh no, Sam. Let's pan just one more.
That last pan showed awful good color.
No!
Now don't get so previous Sam.
We might strike it any minute.
No!
Why are you so stubborn?
What did we come here for anyway?
I'd have never showed up here if I hadn't known there was something here.
Do you realize we're broke?
- Yep.
No grub and no place to sleep.
- Yep.
All I'm trying to do is herd together enough money to go East in decent style.
This girl isn't going to wait forever, you know, without seeing me at least.
You sure that would help?
Hurry up or I'll miss my stage.
- That's 240 dollars.
I heard they got a big strike at Horseshoe Bend.
Steve, it beats me how anybody can avoid getting rich in this country.
People who came here three weeks ago are rich now.
We get worse off by the minute.
Can't we go back and give the mine another try?    - No.
Well, just one more pail of water.
- No.
[ Gunshots! ]
Things sure go fast here.
Poor fellow worked for the newspaper.
Take your opinions with you.
We don't want them.
He had a right to print the facts.
Maybe you want to step into his shoes?
I didn't see nothing, Mr Lake.
Then stand back.
Where is that newspaper office?
- In there.
We've set it out in bold type.
Just under "The Enterprise".
And Billings .. that headline ..
Who are you?
Sam Clemens is my name.
I'm your new reporter.
Joe Goodman is my name, and I've got a reporter.
Didn't you hear that gunfire just now?
You had a reporter.
Was that Davy? They got him too.
What are you doing now?
If there's one man in this town who's so low down that he can't speak his mind ..
And print it if he wants to, then this country is done.
I'm writing an account of how that man died, and it will curl somebody's hair.
Good!
That better, Sam?
Yeah, yeah that's fine, Billings.
Now, set her up.
Sam!
- Yeah?
Sam, where we going to get a frog?
A frog? Billings, you got a frog?
What in time do you want a frog for?
- Brett Harte at Angels Camp got a frog.
Well go borrow his frog. Let me work.
He'll bet every cent he's got, his frog can out-jump any frog in this country.
Don't you see what a chance it is?
Now, you're a Mississippi frog expert.
We ride to Angel's Camp and you pick a frog that will lay it all over his frog.
And we get odds of the ten-to-one and bet every cent we've got.
"We" got?
- Sure.
Now look here Steve, I've worked and slaved and scraped.
I've got almost enough money to go East.
I'll be out of here in another 2 weeks.
Supposing that girl's family turns out to be dead rich?
Suppose they take you for a tramp, and won't even let you through the door?
All because you wouldn't listen to me.
- I tell you, I'm not ..
Brett Harte's got a satchel full of money he's begging us to take.
Trying to force it on us.
- Steve, it's no use.
I'm not going to catch you any frog.
Come on over this way, come on.
Right over here, Sam.
Now, I'll get him if he'll just sit still a minute.
Did you miss him?
- Yeah, I missed him.
Keep after him now, Sam.
- Yeah.
She's a good frog.
- I'll get him ..
Catch him, Sam?
- No, I missed him.
Come on. A little further forward.
I see him, I see him.
I'll grab him by the legs.
Ah .. that one didn't have any legs.
All I got was a mouthful of cat-tail.
Now don't get to giving up.
There's a hundred good frogs in here.
Here's one! He's a real champion.
I'll get him, Steve.
Right .. now Steve.
No! No, Sam. Go to your left.
Go to your left, Sam.
You quit telling me what to do, Steve.
Tell these frogs what to do.
I never saw such slippery frogs.
They must have eel blood in them.
I give up, Steve.
You come in and try it yourself.
It ain't no use.
Can't stay here all day.
Where's the frog?
- I didn't catch any.
Yes I did.
Oh we're sure set to collect now.
Here .. you take this money.
And bet every cent of it on our frog.
You just bet the whole town.
Wait a minute. Where on earth did this money come from?
Well uh .. some of it I took from your mattress.
The rest of it I .. well I gave the landlady a note.
Of course, I had to sign your name.
Steve, for heaven's sake.
I'll be four years paying this off.
Sam .. did I ever let you down?
Yes.
Now Sam, don't talk like a ninny. I tell you I know what I'm talking about.
It's impossible for us to lose.
I tell you, we are in ..
Goddamn Sam!
Holy ..
Free drinks .. free drinks everybody.
Friends .. thank you for making me
Chairman of the "Jumping Jubilee".
We all know why we're gathered here.
Darn tooting we are!
Please, please.
Men of California!
And Nevada!
We're here today to decide a mighty serious thing.
A mighty serious challenge.
Dan'l Webster, the longest jumping frog in the golden West.
Owned by Brett Harte of Angel's Camp.
Has stood undefeated against all-comers.
Raise the odds.
And now comes an unknown frog from Virginia City.
Named after one of our leading citizens.
That fine laundry man and cook:
One Long Hop!
Owned by Steve Gillis and Sam Clemens.
Gentlemen, the honor of our two great cities is in the balance.
I ask for fair play and we're here to see that everybody gets it.
Quiet .. quiet!
Remember, each frog gets three jumps. The sum total counts.
This visiting frog gets the first jump.
- Bring on your frog, Steve Gillis.
You get the money down?
- Every cent.
Here's a hundred. He'll out-jump him.
- I'll embrace that bet.
Do you want to bet fifty dollars on Dan'l Webster?
Velly solly. Me "One Long Hop".
Ground your frog.
No inching .. remember, one tickle on the first jump only.
Why gentlemen, it's virtually an insult to this magnificent specimen.
I repeat, an insult to pit him against the puny entry of my belittler.
Twenty to one.
- Twenty to one.
Gentlemen, we're taking all bets .. 20-1.
A loose hold and he'll leap higher.
Now, hunch them muscles and heave.
Jump one.
Kick son, can't you!
And two.
It's the third and last jump.
Come on now, One Long Hop .. hop!
Hop!
Hop!
Doesn't mean a thing.
Three .. six .. nine .. twelve ..
Shush ..
What does he measure?
Twelve foot six, and two sixteenths.
It ain't too previous to tell you, but we're going to be rich.
That was a great jump, Steve.
Now bring forth Dan'l Webster!
Gentlemen.
You are on the threshold of history.
A little more room, gentlemen.
That's it. Wouldn't like to have anybody injured.
Further back, further back.
Give this amphibian marvel some room.
Release your frog, sir.
Straight down the line, Dan'l.
Aim frog .. and jump it well!
Mind now, only one tickle of the first jump .. that's all, neighbor.
Thank you, Judge. Dan'l doesn't need it.
Get your knees into it now, Dan'l.
Get ready, Dan'l.
Flies .. flies!
That's the first jump.
Pull yourself together, Dan'l.
Get your mind on this.
Give it everything.
Flies .. flies!
That's the second.
I asked you to get further back.
He's afraid to let go.
Get back, folks. Get back, get back.
Now he can jump.
Stranger, would you be so kind as to remove that face?
Give it everything .. flies.
Flies.
You've never thrown off on me yet, Dan'l.
If you love me.
If you love me .. give me the beans!
Flies .. flies!
If he ain't budged in twenty seconds he's out.
Flies .. flies!
That's the third jump. That's official.
I'll pay off every legal bet.
It's unusual weather. I demand a re-jump under more auspicious conditions.
Steve .. I don't know how you got a full pound of buckshot into Dan'l.
But it was very wrong.
Yeah, but we sure won, didn't we.
What's that? Ain't you happy?
I didn't think so much of our frog,
Steve. He looked kind of puny to me.
So I bet everything we had on the Champ .. on Dan'l.
You mean that you? Here, hold on! No! Come on ..
You going to keep on writing forever?
Well, goodnight Sam.
See you in the morning.
Billings ..
Mind if I sign your name to this?
- What for?
Well, I want to send it to New
York and it isn't much good.
You sign my name to a lot of silly drivel, and I'll sue you.
I aim to do a little writing myself one of these days.
Quick .. it's been discovered.
- What, the body?
No this .. look, it's worth ten thousand dollars a ton.
Oh come on Sam, you'll never get rich writing and reading.
And this is the richest strike since the Comstock lode.
Now look, everybody will be there ahead of us. We've got to hurry.
Buck just rode in with the word. All the town is on the move. We need horses.
You round up the horses,
I'll get the rigging.
This is the chance
I've been waiting for.
Pardon me, I'm a stranger.
- That's alright mister. Who ain't?
Where can I find Mark Twain?
Better see Sam Clemens.
He knows everybody.
Come on, hurry up with that extra shoe.
- Hold your horses fellah, hold on.
We got to get going or everything will be took.
I beg your pardon. Do you know a man named Mark Twain?
I never heard of him. Try the jail.
- I did, but you see ..
I beg your pardon. Oh. Do you know ..?
Pardon me.
Hey, this looks kind of familiar.
That's the best I can do.
Sorry boys, but there's nothing left. We got rid of everything. You're too late.
Tim, Tim! Check that load up at the top shaft.
Hey mister, where can we stake our claim?
If you boys had been here an hour ago.
I could have sold you
50 or 60 feet of the vein.
At only a thousand dollars a foot.
You mean, there ain't any left, even at that?
No, I'm sorry.
Tim, Tim! You'll need two teams on that.
Do you remember this place, Sam?
How we located our mine because the mule wouldn't go no further.
We owned the whole mountain.
Do you realize where you're standing?
Of course I realize where I'm standing.
I'm standing exactly in the marks where that other jackass stood.
But I traced Mark Twain to this office.
- What's that again?
Now look, please. If you think a moment, you must know a man named Mark Twain.
Just one more pail of water, I kept begging you, but would you? No.
Stop it will you, Steve.
You want to drive me crazy?
So your mind is set, huh?
Out in this country, I'm nothing but a public risk.
Well, I'm going to miss you, Sam.
You and your tall tales.
A man won't know where to go for a real overpowering line with you out the way.
I'm through playing the fool, Steve.
The only place in the world I belong is at the wheel of a Steamboat.
And the quicker I get back to it, the better.
I'm sorry Mr Pond, but I've never heard the name.
Now look here, Sam.
Quick, grab some paper.
We got to get an extra on the street.
Look here, I'd like to ask you this.
Fort Sumter has been fired on.
- Fort Sumter?       - By who?
The North and the South are at war.
The Mississippi river is closed. The
Federal Army is marching on Virginia.
The Mississippi river is what?
Blockaded. Steamboat sunk at St Louis trying to ram the shore batteries.
No Steamboats .. no river trade ..
And maybe no country. Here.
Here, Billings. Put this in column one.
Hey, where are you going?
I'm going to push the Northern Armies in to the sea. If I can get transportation.
Wait a minute .. what's your name?
Sam Clemens .. River-Pilot.
Oh .. well there must be a Mark Twain somewhere.
Joe.
Put this Mark Twain frog story on the front page of the War News.
On the front page, boss?
If the country ever needed one flicker of a smile, it needs it now.
"And he held Dan'l upside down."
"And that frog belched up a double handful of bird-shot."
One man has kept laughter alive.
And I can't find him.
Say .. if you mean the fellah that wrote The Jumping Frog ..
His name is "Sam Clemens".
He used to be Pilot of the "Queen of Dixie".
You'll likely find him somewhere along the river.
Pretty run down, isn't she.
Oh, I don't know.
She looks proper good there on the boiler deck.
I'd give something to find the Pilot of that Steamboat.
I'd give something to find a Steamboat.
Several years ago, I went to California looking for the Pilot of that boat.
Could have made him a fortune too, if
I'd known his name was not "Mark Twain".
Isn't that a pretty slim clue?
Must be dozens of people
not named "Mark Twain".
His name was Sam Clemens.
He used to pilot this very boat.
Say .. aren't you ..?
Yes, I remember.
I met you in the office of The Enterprise.
You're "Sam Clemens".
You wrote "The Jumping Frog".
Really, this is magnificent.
I'll have you lecturing in
New York within two weeks.
Oh no you don't.
- I'll make you famous .. successful.
Not me. I tried making a speech once.
- Think of the opportunity.
Oh no .. I'm not going to make you any speeches.
Something must have happened.
That's a sure thing.
We can't wait any longer, Sam. The senator must have missed his train.
Look here, Pond.
Somebody's got to introduce me. Not a soul in the audience knows me from Adam.
You need no introduction.
The people come to hear the man who wrote The Jumping Frog.
Nobody remembers that.
Pond, I'm sorry I let you holler me into this.
I'm just not cut out for it, that's all.
I wish to heaven I never had any relations with that frog.
Just relax, you'll be alright. Go on.
- Don't push me out there ..
I tell you, I'd commit suicide this minute if I had the pluck.
And the outfit.
Ladies and gentlemen.
I know that man.
His name is Sam Clemens.
It is my distinguished pleasure ..
To introduce your principal speaker tonight.
Mark Twain is too well known to require a ..
Formal introduction at my hands.
So I'm out here to ..
Do a useless thing.
And that's right in my line.
Halley's comet ..
Halley's Comet comes back to this earth every 75 years.
Which is wonderful.
Science ..
Cannot explain why it wants to come back, after a good look at us.
Mark Twain.
Mark Twain rode into this world on the tail of that comet.
And after tonight a great many people are going to be disappointed ..
If it don't come right back and take him away again.
I give you .. "Mark Twain".
I give you .. "Mark Twain".
I thank the previous speaker.
I have seldom in my lifetime listened to compliments so felicitously phrased ..
Or so well deserved.
When I think of what the newspapers are going to do to me tomorrow.
I wish I could count on as good an epitaph as ..
We gave an old colored woman I knew, who fell on a hot stove and was roasted.
After a great deal of thought.
We just put on her tombstone ..
"Well done. Good and faithful servant".
On one of my recent southernmost trips ..
I overheard Satan himself complaining to a newcomer.
He said "the trouble with you New York people is .. "
"You think you are the best people down here".
"Whereas, you are merely the most numerous."
I thought I'd only be able to speak about five minutes.
And I've talked an hour and a half.
I wonder if you'd let me say one serious thing that I feel .. very much.
I just want to say.
Men will always vary.
In nature, race, creed and desires.
There will always be the ..
The belligerent and the oppressed.
But in our country, we can and ..
Must hold fast to our ideal of democracy because we've made it a shining reality.
Let's cherish our proud traditions of freedom and tolerance.
Let's vow that our tolerance will never become indifference.
And our freedom never become license.
Let's respect each other's rights.
And defend .. with the pen if possible, or the sword if need be.
Our inalienable privilege to be a free and .. united people.
This is indeed a very great pleasure.
Pardon me, Mr Howells.
If you wait here, I'll get Mr Twain.
He's very anxious to meet you.
- Certainly.
Will you excuse me please. William Dean
Howells is here. I just got hold of him.
Who?
Of The Atlantic Monthly, the foremost literary critic in the country.
And he looks perfectly bland. Please play up to him, he's terribly important.
Were all those stories true, Mr Twain?
I wanted to tell you, my aunt had the most amusing experience with a mule.
Mark, I'm very happy to ..
- Just a moment ..
Good evening.
How did you enjoy the lecture?
- He sure has a fine sense of humor.
Excuse me .. I'm so glad to see you.
Livy, I'd like to present
Mr Clemens, or Mr "Twain".
My sister .. I knew you in a second, Mr Clemens.
I'm afraid I've been talking to your sister all evening.
Did you notice?
Why .. I ..
We hope you'll make an appearance in Elmira.
Why, thank you. That's mighty kind.
Well ..
We'll have to hurry to catch our train.
What are we waiting for? Come on.
Mark ..
Yes, I know, I know but ..
But how does he become a house guest?
Honestly father, I don't quite know.
- This is rather preposterous you know.
Sir, I am afraid it is more so than you realize, sir.
You see, when I met
Mr Twain on the river ..
Livy's picture caught his eye and ..
He promptly announced that he was going to marry her.
Marry her?
He's got to get out of here.
The presumption of these
Westerners is beyond endurance.
So just as he grabs for the cat ..
Miss Langdon, he slips on the icy road.
And he goes avalanching down through the trellis.
Right in the middle of my sister's party.
In his night shirt.
Really?
I tell you, if you ever knew Jim Wolf ..
I'm sorry to interrupt you Mr Twain.
But you barely have time to make the 9:25.
Why Jervis ..
- I'm sorry.
Oh ..
I've got no real call to ..
I'll be happy to drive you to the depot.
Don't put yourself to the trouble.
Don't mention it.
The carriage is ready, father.
- Thank you.
Mr Twain, we'll just be able to make it.
Well.
Goodbye.     - Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Twain.
I just want you to know.
Whatever happens next ..
I wouldn't have missed this.
Not for all the steamboats that ever rode the Mississippi.
Goodbye Mr Clemens.
I hope we'll see you again soon.
Step right in Mr Twain, we must hurry.
Now, how did he manage to do that?
Mr Clemens, did you hurt yourself?
What a stupid thing to have happen.
Careful Charles, careful.
- Let's take him inside.
Quick. Get the doctor.
What part of the anatomy did you say he fell on?
I haven't faintest idea.
Well .. just to be safe, we'd better not move him for the present.
He's certainly tame, isn't he.
- Of course he is, Livy.
You know as well as I do there are no wild animals until man makes them so.
I sometimes wonder who is better off.
You do have a very weak opinion of yourself, don't you.
I guess so .. I just don't belong in your world.
Is something wrong with my world?
- No there isn't, Livy.
It's a wonderful world because it's got you in it.
I'm an outsider.
A tramp Pilot. A mud-cat with the river dried up.
There's an example of our temperamental New England weather.
That's the trouble with you folks here in the East.
Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.
I guess you knew all the time I've been here?
Yes, I .. I did.
Now that you've found me out, are you going to tell on me?
I always knew that sometime I'd have to come and find you. See if you were real.
But now ..
Are you disappointed?
Now I know you, you're so much finer and dearer than anything I'll ever dream of.
I know you can't ever marry me,
I know now that isn't possible.
But anyway, I'll always be sure the best thing I ever did was to fall in love.
Well, I reckon I must give back a thing that doesn't rightfully belong to me.
Why .. where on earth did you get this?
First time I saw it, I knew I'd never seen anyone so beautiful, or so sweet.
So .. I stole it.
It's been in the bottom of mines, and up mountains ..
Across plains, everywhere with me.
For a long time.
Why, Mark.
Pretty silly of me, I see now.
I couldn't even support you.
Your father's made that clear to me in a hundred different ways.
And he's right.
Mark .. why did you come East?
To look for you.
That's what brought Sam Clemens here.
But Mark, answer me this.
Why did Mark Twain come East?
You've forgotten about him, haven't you?
- Yeah, I guess I have.
I'm not going to let you forget him again.
Because I'm going to be with you.
I don't care whether we ever have anything or not.
I just want to be with you.
You can say that in spite of your family and everybody .. and everything?
I knew it the night of the lecture.
The first time I looked at you.
Livy, I'd split the world wide open for you to prove you're right.
So this is yours now .. and you can stop all this lying and stealing.
Livy, I give you my word.
I'll never tell another lie.
[ Lightning! ]
He must have heard me.
[ Door knocks ]
Come in.
Sit down Mr Twain.
Or Mr "Clemens".
Rhymes with "lemons".
Oh, I see.
I have finally heard from your friends whom you yourself requested write to me.
I guess I felt I needed a few words in my favor.
This clergyman, the "Reverend
Steven Gillis" of Jackass Hill.
Says that he expects you to fill a drunkard's grave.
Well, would you look at that.
I suppose I've lied for that man 500 times.
Don't you think he could do as much for me, just this once?
Clemens, what kind of people are these?
Haven't you a single real friend in the world?
It surely doesn't seem so, does it.
I admire you for one thing, Mr Clemens.
Your cool courage makes Washington of Valley Forge look timid.
Well, I ..
I'm told that you are a writer.
Perhaps.
Perhaps we here have a little different conception as to what a writer is.
Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier,
Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Men born of these rocks and hills. Great shadowy names like Gods on Olympus.
We think of these as writers.
I shouldn't have thought that some comic bits, tossed off in catch-penny papers.
Would have entitled anyone to class himself among them.
Now Mr Langdon, I don't claim to be ..
I have talked to Livy. I have no further hope of changing her purpose.
You think it's as bad as ..?
- Livy is a delicate, sensitive girl.
You've elected to take her away from everything she's lived for.
Mr Langdon I swear to you, I'd give my life ..
Father .. mother just gave me this.
Mark, look at it!
What is it? Some kind of summons?
No, it's the deed to a house in Buffalo.
Father's wedding gift to us.
Why did you have to scare me so, when you meant to do this wonderful thing?
Livy, your happiness means everything to me.
Mr Langdon sir, I just want you to know if ..
You are ever up in our vicinity you can come and stay with us.
Stay overnight if you want to, and it won't cost you a cent.
Good evening.
Mr Twain, good evening.
It's good to see you again.
I don't know how I'd stay in business without you.
You got a contract with an orphanage, or something?
Oh no, I like to play with these myself.
It's for a little boy.
A tiny little boy. I know.
I can tell by the things you always pick. How old is he?
Well in some ways, by actual counting, he's only about a year.
But him and you are just the same age. Isn't that right?
I can run a month on a compliment like that.
I know .. I know.
You couldn't write like you do if you was any different.
Mr Twain.
Mr Twain.
Could you do me the honor to write your name in "Innocents Abroad"?
I've read it four times.
- Good.
Good .. good.
No, it's you that's good to ask me.
Would you write your name in "Roughing It" too?
I read this one seven times.
By George, I'm going to refund you my royalties.
Will you bring your little boy in to see me? I'd like to meet him.
The very minute he gets over his cold.
- Good, good.
Oh .. how about this nice Noah's Ark?
No, no .. I'm opposed to Noah.
This world would be a lot better off if Noah had .. missed the boat.
Here .. this is more like it.
Just what I wanted.
I'm sure he'll like this.
He doesn't see it.
He doesn't see it.
Get doctor Quintard .. quick.
Have some tea.
Is it going any better, Mark?
I can't write anything, Livy.
I don't reckon I'll ever write anything again.
I wanted to take our little boy to the Mississippi.
I wanted to take his hand and wade with him in the Mississippi mud.
I can feel that mud between my own toes yet.
I can hear the Steamboat whistles far off down the bend.
He'll never see the river now.
No Mark .. our little son will never see it.
But Mark, you must save those things you loved.
You must save them for whole generations of little boys.
Of all ages.
For ever.
You mustn't let those precious things be lost.
You're the only man who ever lived who can do it, Mark.
Because you're the only man in the world who still is that little barefoot boy.
Wading in the Mississippi mud.
Playing out on the raft.
Watching the Steamboats.
The way you've told me so many times.
It all seems so long ago.
But you remember.
You remember it all as nobody else ever can.
You do remember.
You've got to remember.
"Come on Huck. Hurry Jim."
"Hey, what that say?"
"What does pirates have to do?"
"Tom said .."
"Tom said?"
"Hey, that's me."
"Hey, what did I say?"
I wasn't asleep.
Just .. resting my eyes.
Have you nearly finished?
Oh Mark.
Mark .. it's so great.
So human .. so real.
Do you think anyone will ever read it?
Read it?
Why the whole world is going to read it, in every language, in every country.
This year, next year and in a thousand years they will still be reading it.
Do you know what you've done?
You've captured "youth".
You've given eternal youth to every living mortal who can read.
Livy, if you like it, that's all I care about.
"Youth" .. that's what you are.
I'll never be able to think of you as anything else.
Mr Howells.
Mr Howells.
Would you sign this, please.
- Why yes, of course.
That's Mark Twain's latest work, isn't it, sir.
I think this book will cure every torpid liver and chronic grouch in America.
May I read it later, sir? I've read everything he's written.
You have?
Well, nearly everyone I know has read "Roughing It" sir.
And "Tom Sawyer". That was a great one.
All Mark Twain's books have been great, Hardy.
I'll tell you how I know.
I try to read a book solely from the standpoint of a critic.
In spite of it all, I read Twain's books from the standpoint of a human being.
The public must agree with you, sir.
Subscriptions jump enormously every time
Mark Twain's name appears on the cover.
That reminds me.
I want to send him an invitation.
Is he at Quarry Farm or at Hartford?
- Hartford, sir.
Good .. take a letter.
"My dear Mark Twain .."
It beats me.
It beats me.
How can they want me to speak?
At Whittier's birthday of all places.
Oh Mark, I knew this would come.
And William Dean Howells, of all people to ask you.
Remember the night you swept by him after your first lecture?
Do I remember ..?
What are you looking for, dear?
- Collar button.   - It's in your shirt.
They're having people with names that we used to start meals with in Missouri.
Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Henry Waldo Longfellow.
John Greenleaf Whittier.
Oliver "Waldo" Holmes.
Do you think I'd better speak as Mark "Waldo" Twain?
Don't tell me you're going to wear that?
- I threw my neck-tie out the window.
Oh Mark, when will you stop doing those things? I'll find you another one.
Do you suppose they've actually read my things? Ah, they couldn't have.
It's just like unloading an ordinary mud-cat on a parcel of Gods.
Now, it isn't that at all.
It's just that everything we've worked and waited and hoped for.
Is suddenly all coming true.
I .. I can't wait to write to father.
I hooked the tie alright.
Now she's fouled.
I'm William Dean Howells.
Well, come on in if you feel alright.
Rest yourself, sir.
I suppose I'm the happiest person in the world tonight.
For you to be recognized and appreciated by people who know what's fine.
Livy, if one literary gentleman hollers
"snag" I'll probably jump overboard.
Come in.
Excuse me .. there is a Mr Howells.
He is standing quiet .. now.
He's standing by the umbrella stand.
- I had better go down.
Do give them your best tonight. Mark.
I'll bust a boiler for them Livy.
Don't forget, I stay in town overnight.
- I know, dear.
That Mr Howells wants you to fetch it and hurry.     - I'll be there.
I don't know which one of these shoes ..
Oh! Oh hello Pond.
Hey Pond, have you got a pair of suspenders?
Suspenders? Sure.
Well let me have them, will you.
Come on up the trellis.
Here, here. Let me give you a hand.
There hasn't been such a battle between me and my equipment ..
Since the Grand Turk blew up in midstream.
Is Howells here yet?
- Yes, he's downstairs.
You know, Mark.
This is the most important event since I met you on the levy.
After tonight, you'll have those bigwigs right in your pocket.
I tell you one thing Pond.
I'll foist the bigwigs with a doggone surprise they ever had in their lives.
It just come to me while I was dismissing that shirt.
Yes sir, I hope those fellows have a sense of humor.
And so, I give you .. Mark Twain.
Mr Toastmaster.
Mr Whittier.
Gentlemen.
Standing here on the shore of the Atlantic ..
And contemplating certain of its literary billows.
I'm reminded of a thing that happened to me once.
When I had just succeeded in stirring up a little ..
Western literary puddle myself.
I'm sure you're going to enjoy
Mark Twain, Mr Whittier.
Yes.
I started an inspection tramp through the mines of California.
I was callow and conceited.
And resolved to try the virtue of my pen-name.
I very soon had an opportunity.
I knocked at a miner's lonely cabin in the Sierra Snows.
A melancholy, bare-footed man opened the door.
And when I told him I was Mark Twain ..
He looked more dejected than before.
He let me in pretty reluctantly, I thought.
Then he said, in the voice of one who is secretly suffering ..
"You're the 4th literary man who's been here in 48 hours. I'm going to move."
Oh, you don't tell me, said I.
Who were the others?
He said ..
Mr Longfellow, Mr Emerson,
Mr Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Consound such a rough bunch.
You can easily believe I was interested.
I supplicated.
Three hot whiskeys did the rest.
Finally, the melancholy miner began.
Says he ..
"Mr Holmes was as fat as a balloon.
He weighed as much as three hundred."
"Mr Emerson was a seedy little bit of a chaff, red-headed."
"Mr Longfellow was built like a prize-fighter."
"His head was cropped and bristly like a wig made of hairbrushes."
"And they'd been drinking.
I could see that."
"However .."
"However, I start to get out my bacon and beans."
"Mr Holmes gets his eye on a jug."
Says he, "fish out a stream of blood-red wine, for I would drink to other days".
"So by George, I was getting kind of worked up."
Did you sponsor this?
- It never occurred to me.
"So now Mr Emerson, he points to me and he says .."
"Is yonder squalid peasant all that this proud nursery could breed?"
He was a whetting of his Bowie knife on his boot at the time so I let that pass.
I stopped the miner ..
And said.
Why these were not the gracious singers to whom the world pays loving reverence.
These were imposters.
The miner investigated me for a while and then said ..
"Ah, imposters were they? Are you?"
I did not pursue the subject.
Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier,
Oliver Wendell Holmes.
We think of these as writers .. and you compare yourself to these men?
Mr Chairman, in my enthusiasm I may have exaggerated the details a little.
But I .. hope you'll forgive me.
Since I believe this is the first time I have ever ..
Deflected from perpendicular fact.
On an occasion like this.
Livy .. please.
Please.
I ought to be shot.
I guess almost anybody would be glad to furnish the powder and lead.
I don't see how any one man can be so many kinds of a fool.
Mark.
Livy.
What on earth ever persuaded you to marry such an insufferable idiot?
Mark .. I'm only crying because ..
Because I've been reading your new story.
Your "Huckleberry Finn".
It's the greatest thing you've ever done.
It's greater than Tom Sawyer.
Don't you know?
Haven't you heard?
You must tell me what's coming next in this wonderful story.
And tell me by writing it .. so it won't be lost.
Finishing this is more important than anything else could be in the world.
Believe me .. believe me Mark.
This is what matters.
It hardly seems possible that I could ever ..
But if this is half as good as Livy seems to think ..
I'm sorry, Mark.
I hurried over to borrow the papers.
But Livy must have cut out the reports, hoping you wouldn't see them.
Don't let it beat you, Mark.
That girl believed in me.
When not one voice, not one word, was raised on my behalf.
I promised my immortal soul that I'd prove she was right.
I didn't know then that I'd have to change myself, clear down to the roots.
The way I think, the way I breathe.
The very words I know.
But I can do that too.
I'll start again .. I'll change the name I write with.
"Mark Twain"?
The Mississippi river did this to Livy.
The mud of the Mississippi is in my blood.
Well Pond, I'm going to get it out.
I'm going to get it out if it's the last thing do!
Mark, why won't you tell me where we're going?
Because I want to astound you.
You'll see in a few minutes.
Can't you even say ..
- All I can say is ..
You're going to see a thing that's going to revolutionize the civilized world.
Is that all?
- It will change our lives too.
Change our lives?
- I have plans, Livy.
Plans for getting myself out of the mud.
It's a plunge, I know that.
Before we're through, we may have to pitch in every cent we've got.
But what an opportunity.
Livy, this is the best thing to happen to me since Joe Twitchell married us.
Isn't it wonderful, Livy? Nothing like it has been seen in the world before.
When I was a boy, I never dreamed it was possible.
What is it?
It's a Typesetter. It sets type all by itself when you press these keys.
I know it looks ridiculous now Livy, but the principle is amazing.
It picks up the type here, and it sets it altogether in the proper place here.
Think, Livy.
A machine setting hundreds of words a minute, thousands of pages a day.
That's right Mrs Clemens.
Of course this machine is just to give you a crude idea.
Just the principle of the thing .. I'll show you.
First, you wind the helical spring .. then ..
You release these.
Then the line's catch.
Engage the clutch .. then you sit down and play it like an organ.
See.
What did I tell you?
It needs a little adjustment.
Ouch .. it's .. it's uncanny.
Can you see it, Livy?
Mark, is this what we're putting all our money into?
Why, I don't mean this thing the way it is now.
I'm seeing a great, smooth-running engine the way it's going to be someday.
It will reduce the cost of printing fifty percent.
If we can only get it perfected in time to start our publishing house with this.
What publishing house?
- Livy ..
Huck Finn is the last funny book
I'm ever going to write .. I hope.
Its royalties will have to last us a long time.
So .. I'm going to publish it myself.
Mark, have you gone out of your mind?
I got fifty ideas for making publishing into a real thing.
A whole new kind of publishing.
But no writer has ever before done it.
- Yes, nobody. But we'll do it now.
We'll sell a hundred thousand copies, a million copies.
Cover the whole country.
Own our own paper-mill.
Then my hands will be free to write something serious .. and good.
But Mark, everybody reads your stories and loves them.
But it isn't good enough, Livy.
There's people in the world whose proper company is with the stars of Heaven.
You are one of them.
I mean to get the stars for you, Livy.
You know .. a little change here .. a little change there ..
And $5,000 more, and we'll perfect it.
Fine .. fine. I'll give you a check.
"I tell you, we'll astound the world with that typesetter."
"Yes, sir! This is certainly the age of progress."
"Why, it beats me how anybody can keep from getting rich in this country."
"Telegraph lines race out and tie the hemisphere together."
"Railroads done roll across thousands of miles."
"The whole nation is .. coming of age."
"Great new leaders rise up."
"A Missouri tanner who fought the battle of the wilderness .."
"Leads his country in new victories and peace."
The typesetter has developed too, Mark.
$10,000 more will perfect it.
"Our publishing house is growing, Mark.
Its grosses run into tens of thousands."
"Yeah, but why don't we make some profits?"
"Another funny book, Mark.
You must have money."
"Another, and then another. One more funny book, for the publishing house."
One more for the typesetter.
"Whole cities spring up.
Great industries are born."
"My part is to think up a giggle."
"Another book, another."
"$5,000 more will perfect it."
"The publishing house needs money, Mark."
"Another book, another! Perfect it."
"$5,000, $10,000. Money, money, money."
"Money, money, money.
Is there any end to this?"
"Can't I ever free my hands for one year, for one week?"
"To do the single, fine, serious work I owe to Livy?"
"One more funny book, one more. For the typesetter, for the publishing house."
"More, Mark. More. For the typesetter.
The typesetter, the typesetter."
$10,000 more Mr Twain.
Can't I even get five minutes to swim?
"While I scribble and scribble year after year."
"I tell you, the world is getting away from me."
"Would you stop now after ten years of struggle and lose all you've invested?"
Yes!
I've gotten into the worst mess ever seen.
You're the best financier in New York, Rogers.
All you got to do is get me out.
Well, when you asked me to straighten out your affairs, Mark.
I had no idea they were so involved.
- I want to get shot of everything.
The typesetter, the publishing house.
I'm glad to hear you say that, Mark.
I believe I can get you out of this now .. and still avoid bankruptcy.
Good. Good.
And just as soon as I publish this last book, we close the whole shebang.
Mark, if you invest one more cent in anything, I can't get you out.
This is the memoirs of Ulysses
S. Grant. This is living history.
I'm sorry Mark, but if you're going to get yourself out, with a whole skin ..
You've got to stop now.
You can't publish this or any other book.      - This book ..
Well, alright.
I'll see Grant and explain.
I guess he'll understand.
Oh Mr Twain.
- Is the General in?
Yes, sir. He's in the study.
Mr Twain .. come in, come in.
This is an honor.
- General.
I regret that illness prevents me from rising.
Pull up a chair .. sit down my friend.
Thank you.
I regret also that circumstances prevent me from greeting you with more ..
Pomp and ceremony.
Sit down.
- Oh General, I ..
I had no idea.
You hadn't, Mr Twain.
But then, times are moving.
Humanity is busy with its own affairs.
I believe you once said yourself ..
"Poverty is no disgrace, but it is a damnable inconvenience."
I presume you've come to talk about my book?
Oh yes .. yes, I ..
I've come .. about the book.
I was delighted to have received your letters.
And to know that you thought so highly of my work.
General .. you've had offers from other publishers.
Yes, yes. Can't you see them?
This is ridiculous.
This is outrageous.
At every point they've sensed the fair thing to do and scrupulously avoided it.
Only "ten percent" royalty?
General, if you ever permit yourself to sign such a contract as this, well ..
Isn't that all I have a right to expect?
A "right to expect"?
General Grant.
Who has a right to expect more than you?
In his own times perhaps,
General, no man is truly great.
But believe me, sir.
Millions of children yet unborn.
Will know and realize your greatness.
Mr Twain.
That's the sincerest tribute that has ever been paid to any man.
Mark, you are insane.
I warn you, this will bring about your absolute ruin.
I saw Grant ride in to Washington at the head of 50,000 men.
Lean, strong, victorious.
He rode straight into the White House then .. and I saw him yesterday.
It was unbelievable. He sat there broken, sick, old .. literally dying.
But still courageous!
- Well, we'll put on a campaign.
That's exactly what we can't do!
But Mark, there are other publishers.
- I've seen their offers.
They're taking a miserable advantage of his poverty and humiliation.
A cash advance, and seventy percent of the gross?
Have you committed yourself to these terms?
There are things here bigger than you or me, Rogers. For General Grant, even.
When we turn our backs on men like that.
We're changing ourselves into something cowardly, and weak and mean.
It takes all the dignity out of humanity.
It leaves us nothing but shame for what we are.
But all that isn't on
your shoulders, Mark.
You know that I could publish this manuscript of his.
And overnight his sad, broken, beggary would end.
Do you honestly think that Grant's book would prove such a tremendous success?
I'm not interested in making one penny on the rescue of General Grant.
Then that settles it.
I tell you again Mark, if you do this one thing more, I can never get you out.
You'll be writing for the rest of your life, just to pay off your debts.
With bankruptcy staring you in the face.
- It might be worth it.
Mark.
General Grant would be the last person to permit a risk to anyone but himself.
I beg of you. Please consider it carefully and calmly.
Katie .. Katie Leary!
Where in blazes are my pipe-cleaners now?
What kind of ornery dunderhead trifling do I have to put up with around here?
Katie Leary, you wild Irish Fenian!
What do you mean by this?
How many thousand times have I told ..
- Why you be hollering your top off?
Let me tell you something, Katie Leary.
There's nothing lower on this earth than a pipe-cleaner stealer.
Shame to you! With the little ones so close to, and in bed.
So upset they'll be with your hollering that they won't get a wink of sleep.
That pipe-cleaner was worth upwards of 5,000 dollars.
If you'd stop your infernal raids on my desk ..
And quit making an everlasting wreck of this stuff.
Things wouldn't be so calamitous around here. Now, watch this.
There .. you see that line?
If you ever dare set foot across that line again ..
You'll instantly die seven different deaths!
All of them new!
You get it?
There is your pipe-cleaner.
Foul plague that it be.
Who put it there?
The idea of a grown man behaving like you do.
He's worse than a lot of children.
Mark, I know it's a terribly hard decision to make.
But you shouldn't take it out on Katie.
I'm not angry at Katie.
She's just excitable.
I wish I could help you.
But whatever you decide to do about General Grant ..
I know will be right.
I'm not at all sure I want to be right.
When I think of the disagreeable folk
I know who've gone to a better world.
I'm moved to lead the worst life I can.
Come on Papa.
- Papa.
We're waiting for you to tell us a story.
Jean .. Suzy.
- I'm coming.
I'll put them to bed.
- I can still do that, can't I?
If it were anyone in the world but .. General Grant.
Come on, darlings.
Where are we going?
- I'll show you.
Who was General Grant, Papa?
- Was he a Mississippi Pilot?
Well he's ..
He's more like a woolly bear.
Come on Clara. Papa is going to tell us a story.
About a woolly bear?
- Yes, dear.
Once .. there was a woolly bear.
And he lived in a wonderful woods.
Full of lollipop bushes and all kinds of little animals.
And one day the woods caught fire.
And what did the bear do?
Well, he saw all the other little animals running away.
So he started to run too.
But he looked around and suddenly he turned and he ran right at the fire.
Youth.
If you're trying to give those babies nightmares again ..
It's alright Mama.
We never believe Papa's stories.
Go on, Papa.
Well, he ran right straight into the fire, and he began to spank it.
And he just flew around that woods, battering that old fire right to pieces.
What happened?
He saved the whole thing.
Did you see him, Papa?
Oh yes. Yes, I saw him.
And then after a while it was winter, all cold and snow.
And in all the woods, there wasn't one warm home for that old woolly bear.
So he went away because woolly bears don't know how to beg from anyone.
And he walked far off, very slowly, on his old hurt paws.
And he laid down in the snow.
All alone .. a dying old bear.
Nobody remembering or caring about him anymore.
Poor old woolly bear. Did he die, Papa?
Not yet darling .. and we can't let him.
"Mark, you're insane. I warn you, this will bring about your absolute ruin."
"I saw Grant ride in to Washington at the head of 50,000 men."
"But all that isn't on your shoulders, Mark."
"But there are other publishers."
"If we turn our backs on men like that."
"We change ourselves into something cowardly and weak and mean."
"It takes all the dignity out of humanity."
"It leaves us nothing but shame for what we are."
"Millions of children yet unborn, will know and realize your greatness."
"That's the sincerest tribute that has ever been paid to any man."
"I tell you again Mark, if you do this one thing more I can never get you out."
"You'll be writing for the rest of your life, just to pay off your debts."
"With bankruptcy staring you in the face."
Mark, it's impossible for me to conceive ..
How a man of your superb ability has ended up in such a hopeless position.
Maybe it's because I've a greater genius for getting myself into the worse fixes.
Than any man that ever lived.
You made a fortune for General Grant's widow. What did you get out of it?
Satisfaction.
Mrs Grant ..
And hundreds of your friends throughout the country offer their assistance.
Why won't you let us help you?
Once, down on the Mississippi there was a big flood.
And old Darkie, standing on the shore saw a cat floating by on a chicken coop.
And that cat was a friend of his.
So he got himself a pole, and tried to pull it ashore.
Do you know what happened to the Darkie?
- What?
He fell in himself.
After a while, that cat just .. jumped ashore.
Mark, do you think you can ever jump ashore from this chicken-coop?
Gentlemen .. I've just come from the creditors meeting.
Yes?
- We reached an agreement.
I convinced them they couldn't expect more than fifty cents on the dollar.
Fifty cents on the dollar?
I won't accept it.
I'm warning you.
Go back and tell them I won't accept it.
Go back and say it's not good enough.
I'll pay them every penny I owe.
That's you'd like Mark, but do you know your debt is a quarter million dollars?
Why, it's utterly impossible.
Gentlemen, once when I wanted a frog ..
I went right out where the frogs were, and I got one.
A lot of foolish people in the world are willing to pay money to hear me speak.
So I'm going on a lecture tour.
First, across the United
States to the West Coast.
Then across the Pacific to Hawaii.
Australia, New Zealand,
China, India, Africa.
I'll speak in every principal city in this infernal globe.
I'll talk around the world, as long as anybody will listen.
Around the world? Mark, do you realize what a plan like this means at your age?
Night after night, month after month, travelling, talking.
Why, it's beyond anyone's physical endurance.
You know of an easier way to earn a quarter of a million dollars?
But Africa?
Well, I guess I can stand it if Africa can.
What's the matter, don't you think I'd be funny in Hottentot?
Why the common flea has been to all these places.
You want me beaten out by a flea?
I'll talk wherever six people will gather together at a crossroads.
Then I'm going to flabbergast those creditors.
Heavens. If you can do this Mark, you'll be the most famous man in the world.
And me the richest.
Can't we fix it to make you the most famous and .. me the richest?
There's Mark Twain.
Hi Mark, you got Huck Finn with you?
- Good luck Mark.
Hey Mark, you're the Prince.
And I'm the pauper.
I'll be carrying this one.
- Yes sir.
Thank you. Now what are you all sniffling about?
Can't a man go away once in his life without being cried over?
You're crying yourself, Papa.
- I am not.
Papa, please take care of yourself.
Now look here, Clara. Am I raising a daughter, or are you raising me?
Why I'm raising you. Somebody has to.
Well, don't worry about me.
I came into the world with Halley's comet.
And I'm staying here until it comes back for me.
That won't be for a long time, I hope.
"All aboard!"
Mark, I want to go with you.
- Oh now, don't start that again, Livy.
It's only because you'll be here with the girls that I can go.
Mark! Come on.
- Alright, alright.
Oh, Youth! I want so to go with you.
Now Livy, it will do you good being shot of me for a while after all these years.
Don't forget, you're coming over just as soon as the girls are off to school.
"All aboard!"
- Goodbye Jean.
Goodbye Papa.
- Suzy.
Goodbye Papa.
- Clara.
Please .. please take care of yourself.
"All aboard!"
Take care of yourself.
That's more important.
Goodbye, Papa.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye Papa.
- Goodbye Papa.
Goodbye, Youth .. goodbye.
Mother, you were wonderful.
Papa didn't have the least idea you weren't feeling well.
You know, there has been a great to-do over Adam as the inventor of sin.
Why, it was nothing at all.
I could have done it myself.
Ladies and gentlemen.
In the United States.
We refer to Australia as the other side of the world.
But I must say, now that I'm here.
It feels just as right-side-up as the other side.
I have a cable here from Rogers.
- Oh.
"Mark .. you have a long way to go."
Mark Twain .. ha-ha.
In my travels around the world.
I have been impressed by one fact more than any other.
The universal brotherhood of man.
He is our most precious possession.
What there is of it.
The trouble with the human race is ..
The human race.
Concerning the difference between man and the jackass.
Some observers hold that there isn't any.
But this .. wrongs the jackass.
In fact .. speaking of animals.
I have often thought .. that God ..
Probably created the monkey.
Because he was disappointed in Man.
I say, I have a cablegram from America.
It says: "Mark Twain is dead".
Oh I say, this is rotten luck.
- What's the matter young man?
It's rather awkward, sir. You see
Mr Twain, I get paid by the word.
And they don't want an item unless you're dead.
And I had counted on at least 500 words.
Well, I tell you what you do.
You cable them 1,000 words saying ..
Oh .. just say the report of my death ..
Has been greatly exaggerated.
Greatly exaggerated.
Well, it is isn't it?
Oh yes .. of course!
Ladies and gentlemen.
William Shakespeare .. probably the greatest man of English letters.
Is dead.
John Keats .. one of our finest poets.
Is dead.
And I feel .. far from well myself.
Sometimes, I don't see how I can cook up one more silly remark.
I am thought-dry.
And I've still got to disillusion Paris and Brussels, Amsterdam and Munich.
Mark, what would be the best news I could give you?
That I'd never have to face another audience as long as I live.
Well, two more lectures and you won't have to.
You'll have paid every cent you owe.
I won't have to be comical in Dutch?
- No.
And I can join Livy in Florence?
I'm glad I had her wait for me there.
She never could have stood it.
Mark .. you've done it.
- Of course I've done it.
Pond, always .. for every moment.
I have held the unwavering belief that this thing was ..
Utterly impossible ..
Good day, a letter from London.
- Grazie.
Mrs Clemens .. it is a letter from
Mr Clemens .. from London.
Oh, he's coming.
I know he's coming very soon.
"And now I want to do nothing in this lopsided world but see you in Florence."
"No boat is fast enough nor train speedy enough to bring me to you."
"Goodnight, dear heart."
"Sweet dreams .. Mark."
You take this now.
It will make you rest.
It seemed impossible.
But he had so much courage.
We will go in now.
You will sleep a little maybe, huh?
I thought maybe she'd see it when she woke.
Maybe make her smile.
She'll love it.
You know Mark, I think ..
- Shush.
Mark.
Mark.
- Yes, dear?
Mark .. come quickly.
Livy .. what? Are you alright?
Livy, what's happened?
Why, you look like you've seen an angel.
Mark .. what would it take to make you think you are a pretty good writer?
Well, I did kind of set out to be.
Only the paper gave out.
You see .. I've known it for a long time.
I've known it all our life together.
Livy, dearest.
You make me feel I can count on one vote.
Even if I ran on a Republican ticket.
Of course, the people always knew it.
They loved you from the very first.
You know, that's like our babies. Always liked me best when I stood on my head.
You struggled so hard to be something else.
To get away from the wonderful thing you are.
But darling, that very struggle you made ..
Wrote your name in the everlasting stars.
This is from Oxford University, Mark.
They've sent for you.
You are to be given the same honorary degree ..
As was given Wordsworth and
Macaulay, and Robert Browning.
The name "Mark Twain" is with them now.
There isn't any higher honor, Mark.
Livy .. do you really think that ..?
With all my heart.
And now dear .. promise me one thing.
You must go to Oxford.
Even if I can't be there.
And stand where those other greats have stood.
For me.
Yes, I promise, Livy.
I don't think any woman has ever been as happy.
As I am tonight.
Now Mark, will you sing to me a little while.
While I go to sleep.
[ Singing: ]
"Swing low sweet chariot."
"Coming for to carry me home."
"Swing low sweet chariot."
"Coming for to carry me home."
"I looked over Jordan, and what did I see?"
"Coming for to carry me home."
"A band of angels, coming after me."
"Coming for to carry me home."
"Swing low sweet chariot."
"Coming for to carry .."
You can stop now Mark .. I think.
It's so beautiful, I ..
I can't believe she doesn't see it.
I can't go back to America right away.
There's something I promised her to do.
I'll see that everything is taken care of, Mark.
I want you to have this carved on the stone for her resting place in Elmira.
I couldn't .. write anything myself.
"Warm summer sun .. shine kindly here."
"Warm Southern wind."
"Blow softly here."
"Green sod above."
"Lie light .. lie light."
"Goodnight, dear heart."
"Goodnight .. goodnight."
Bravo, Connecticut Yankee.
I say, did you bring your chopping fork with you?
This is much better than
"roughing it" isn't it?
I say, how's Huckleberry Finn?
And so Rudyard Kipling, I confer on you the degree: "Doctoris Literarum".
Samuel Langhorne Clemens.
Mark Twain.
Most amiable and charming Sir.
You shake the sides of the whole world with your merriment.
In the heart of the American continent, a great river, the glorious Mississippi.
Gave its lifeblood to a young nation throughout its early days.
The part played by that river in world history .. is now done.
But.
Through the writings of this single man.
The river flows on.
A part of our own lives .. forever.
And yet he has done more than bring a river to our hearts.
Through humble, human scenes.
Through glimpses of bare-footed men and bewildered boys.
He has preserved to us our finest record of a great nation as it came of age.
A record that stands.
Imperishable and irreplaceable.
Like the pyramids of Egypt.
Immortalizing a stirring age.
He has given us even more.
He has made it impossible for any man ever again.
To mistrust the soil in which his own life found root.
Or to doubt that he himself may draw from it all greatness.
Wherever that soil may be.
He has taught us that it is through the laughter and tears .. of humble folk.
That a nation's story may be most truly told.
All this we, the people of England, nay, the peoples of all nations.
Owe to Mark Twain.
You know Quintard, it beats me.
I suppose Man is the only living animal who never knows where he's at.
You take the cat that sat on a hot stove lid.
She didn't have any perspective or time to think.
But she knew instinctively that cat, what she had done.
She got off at once!
I have to run now, Mark.
0h, can't you sit and smoke just one Manila?         - No!
This is better than I usually offer you.
And neither can you.
I'll look at the reports now, Clara.
- They're in the study, Doctor.
You don't need to do that now, father.
Just force-of-habit I suppose.
Where's my cat?
Well, she's busy.
She'll explain to you later.
Seems only a few minutes ago that that cat was a kitten.
Now she's fifteen cats.
Twenty cats .. that's what she's busy with.
Sometimes I feel like a stalk of corn.
Left standing all alone .. in a field.
Nobody left for me to ..
Play with anymore ..
Doctor Quintard .. Doctor Quintard!
"Sam .. Sam .. here we are."
"Come on .. come on."
Oh my darling, if you could only know.
What you look upon as my death, has been greatly exaggerated.
"Sam .. Sam .. come on .. come on .."

12:00!
12:00 and all is well!
The night is fair!
The wind is down!
And the commander's daughter has recovered from the sickness!
And the people of Guadela are grateful for a night of peace!
God be thanked in his heaven.
That midnight strikes and all is well!
A poor haul, but an easy one.
We'll do ourselves better in Maracaibo.
What are you moping about?
Here. Drink this.
No?
It was an easy scuffle, Jamie-Boy.
Aye, it was.
Hey, what are you rubbing your nose for?
- I'm thinking on something.
- Out with it!
They're hanging Captain
Morgan this week... hanging him on the docks in London.
- That's what I'm thinking on.
- Anybody lets himself get... caught and hung is nobody to drink to.
To Captain Morgan, I say!
Hanging or walking, he's a better man than the pack of us.
Give me that comb.
Let go of that, you! Blast it!
I must drink to this occasion,
Captain Waring.
We are not often honored by such a distinguished visitor.
What a magnificent record.
Second in command to Henry Morgan... in the raid on Panama... the sack of Maracaibo,
Portobelo, Trujillo!
Quite a busy little cutthroat we have here.
But there is no mention of you at the attack on Granada.
I was there... killing Spaniards.
The English dog still barks! Is your memory improving?
Have you remembered where...
- Captain Morgan is?
- Perfectly.
- Where is he?
- In England.
You lie.
I grant you England is where he should be... hanging from a gibbet with the rest of you scum of the sea!
But I have word from our ambassador... that he escaped.
Your news delights me, Don Miguel.
Oh. And perhaps this will delight you too.
A quarter of a turn!
Where were you planning to meet Morgan?
On the far side of the moon.
Where is his ship?
Hull down and sailing through your whiskers, Don Miguel.
A full turn!
Speak, you devil spawn, before I quarter you!
- What is that?
- The devil looking after his own.
Easy, my brave bag of wind!
Tommy Blue! Welcome to Corrientes!
Be with you in a minute,
Captain Jamie.
Hand over that sticker while I'm... in this loving mood. March!
Ho-ho! You're outnumbered.
Me and Jamie... could outnumber your whole empire!
Take those stickers away before they hurt themselves!
Came into the harbor to get a barrel of water... and says to a fellow, says I...
"How's me old friend Don Miguel?"
"Well," says he, "the noble Spaniard is entertaining people."
"Who?" says I."Well, among his guests," says he, "is Jamie Waring."
"Well," says I, "that's a party
I've got to attend."
- So up we came.
- Ah. I'll thank you later.
But tell me, Tommy, who's with you?
- How many ships have you got?
- Oh, two pretties, Jamie.
The second one's tacking in, but let me tell you the good news first!
Never mind the news. Get me that bottle of wine.
- Huh? Oh.
- Quick.
There's nothing like a stretch on the rack to raise a thirst.
Would you want to be laying down a minute, Jamie?
No.
Keep a clear head, Tommy.
We've got work to do...
Nice, pleasant work.
I'm a better man drunk than sober for any kind of work!
You were admiring my bark,
Don Miguel.
- We'll see how you like my bite.
- But I'm unarmed.
It's lucky you are. If you had a sword in your hand... you'd be dead by now and stiffer than the devil's tail.
Give me a hand! Put him on the rack!
- Here.
- Move! Get a move on!
Go on!
Have mercy, senor! What are you going to do now?
I'm eager to return your hospitality, Don Miguel.
- On the rack!
- Oh, no, no. Please, no.
You'll hang for this! You'll hang for this, all of you.
Your English governor...
In the name of God, let me go!
Let me go!
- Lord Denby! Lord Denby!
- A musical fellow, ain't he?
Your bark, Don Miguel, is a little louder than mine.
Turn the wheel, my lads.
What say the poets? "One good turn deserves another."
Stop that, you bloody thieves!
Unchain this man! I command you in the name of King Charles.
And who may you be, you bellowing rabbit?
I'm Lord Denby, governor of Jamaica.
Oh, Lord Denby.
You're the gentleman who brought
Captain Morgan to trial.
I'm delighted to meet you.
And I'll see you hanging on Wapping
Executional Dock beside him.
- I'm laughing me sides out!
- March out, you renegade louts!
Renegade! You yellow turncoat!
Befriending the Spanish and hanging your own countrymen!
Lay down your arms!
England and Spain... are at peace. A treaty has been signed.
Where was it signed, Lord Denby, on that rack?
Men, here's a rope-maker for your necks... the little English hangman from Jamaica.
Up the rope he goes!
Up he goes.
Oh, I'm glad to see Jamie is here.
- Give me a rope, somebody!
- No, no, Tommy.
- No rope for him.
- Oh, let me hang him, Jamie.
No. The rope's for gentlemen with brave hearts.
The vault's the place for this English traitor.
Lock him away with all his
Spanish friends.
You'll hang, all of you!
March him off! Chain him to the wall!
Let him rot in the Spanish damp.
You sea rats! I command you in His Majesty's name!
Your commanding days are over, my lord.
I'm laughing me sides out!
Put away that bottle, Tommy.
There's treasure to load.
This is a ripe and juicy castle.
Here, you guzzler! Take this!
Make yourself a pretty pair of drawers!
Two ships, you said, huh? We can load 'em both from this castle... and sail for Maracaibo!
Gut the whole Spanish Main strip it and leave it like a... horse's skull on the desert.
Look at him.
Look at him.
He's fainted.
Or is he just bored with our presence?
- Close your eyes, Don Miguel.
- Father!
- The devil's asking for you.
- Father?
Where's my father?
The captain's share, gentlemen.
I bespeak it.
Where is he?
Stay away or I'll shoot! I'm
Lord Denby's daughter.
Ohhh. This is a windfall.
Lady Margaret, eh?
- Who are you?
- A sea rat... a bit of ocean scum doing
His Majesty's dirty work... killing the Spaniards to make room for... fat Englishmen and their nasty daughters.
Waring is my name, but those who... love me call me Jamie-Boy.
I'm not afraid of you gallows dancers.
"Gallows dancers"? A pretty phrase, milady.
Yes. I've seen your kind dancing in the wind... with their necks stretched like a lot of geese flying.
And I'll see you that way too!
Where's my father? Tell me or I'll shoot.
Your father is ornamenting a dungeon wall, milady.
But you'll forget about him as soon as you learn to... call me Jamie-Boy.
Let go of me, you brute!
I always sample a bottle of wine before I buy it.
Let's have a sip, see if you're worth taking along.
Oh! You wench! Bite me, will you?
Strike me blind! It's a ghost.
- Hello, Jamie-Boy.
- Captain Morgan!
Don't stand there gaping like a halibut on a pier.
Henry! What in the name of thunder?
- So you weren't hanged!
- Not successfully.
You escaped!
No. A king's pardon and more.
I'm swooning like a bride.
I was telling you,
Jamie, I had news for you.
Aye, a packet of news it is, me boy.
Now put your shirt on. You look much too naked for a decent Englishman.
And now find me my great admirer... the so-called governor of Jamaica.
And if this sad little wench be his daughter, fetch her... some smelling salts.
And you, Tom Blue, tell all me old captains... to meet me tonight at the Porker's Sterne.
Aye.
- But I...
- Jamie-Boy, I got a lot to tell you.
Silence!
Now listen to me.
If there's anybody wants to tell me different... let him stand up and get his head broke in.
I say Captain Morgan's a king's spy.
He bought his life by offering to put all... his old cronies on the end of a rope.
I say Morgan's a yellow dog!
Now, wait there, Captain Leech.
We ought to hear what...
Morgan's got to say.
Are you calling me a liar?
No, but I'm saying we oughta hear Morgan out.
And nobody's calling me a liar.
Now, then, anybody else want their head broke in?
I say Captain Morgan's a two-faced cur with the king's brand on him.
And I say Captain Leech is a gibbering ape... fit only for the company of baboons.
Ah, gentlemen, Captain Leech is in a temper.
Aha! Morgan's fetch-and-carry.
Don't cross with him, Jamie. You're too drunk to do yourself justice.
- A little room, please.
- I always wanted to cut that... oily tongue out of you.
Leech! Jamie! Stop it!
Stop it, you lubbers! Stop or
I'll blast the both of you!
I told you he was coming!
Sit down, you two.
Over there, Captain Leech.
Your seat, Captain Waring.
Ale for all hands, Barney... and keep it pouring till we're all drowned.
Gentlemen, I am delighted to see you all still alive and kicking.
You were all my captains once... and I have called you together to know if you will still follow me.
Where to? The gallows at
100 guineas a head?
Your head, Captain Leech... were it filled with gold instead of slops, wouldn't fetch that.
Gentlemen...
I have come from England with an offer from...
His Majesty King Charles.
A king's pardon and a hundred acres of land... to each of you who will settle down ashore... or take your ships into peaceful trade.
Oh, they'll clap us in jail the minute we dump... our cannon.
It's a trick.
And who's going to give us the hundred acres of land?
- The new governor of Jamaica.
- The new governor?
- And who is the new governor?
- Henry Morgan...
Sir Henry Morgan... knighted by His Majesty and assigned the island of Jamaica for his ruling.
I said it before and I say it again.
A king's spy.
No, Captain Leech. A king's right arm in the Caribbean... and a strong one.
Gentlemen, England has signed a peace with Spain...
The long fight is over.
It's a trick.
Spain wants a breathing spell from our attacks... so she can strengthen her forces here.
- Quiet, Jamie.
- It's a scurvy trick, I say!
Sit down!
They'll bring over armies and ships to murder us if we... give them peace.
- Aye, they will.
- Quiet, you bubbleheads!
The privateers are done for.
They're in the past.
They must give way now to progress and the making of... law-abiding colonies.
England wants peace and time to build her empire.
Will you join me for that,
Brother Leech?
I sailed the Main with you, Morgan... and if you're crawling under the king's flag...
I'll keep sailing it without you!
- Who's coming along to Maracaibo?
- There's a lot of gold in Maracaibo.
As governor of Jamaica, I make my first pronouncement.
I'll run every pirate and privateer into the bottom of the Caribbean.
I give those of you who don't join me... a month to clear out of
English waters.
My ship, the Black Swan, don't drop... her sails for any king's spy.
That's my answer to you,
Captain Morgan.
And if any of you yellow-livers get the blood... back in you, I'll lead you against Maracaibo!
Who's coming with me?
- I, sir!
- And I, sir!
Jamie Waring. Come on, Jamie-Boy.
He's got the king, but we've got the wind on our side.
And a captain's share of Maracaibo.
Get down, you drunken fool. You're my second in command.
Hey, Barney. More ale for
Captain Waring.
- Aye, sir.
- Gentlemen, to Captain Waring... my loyal right hand at
Government House.
Come on, Jamie. You were never meant to suck your thumb in a king's collar.
- We'll get you a new ship.
- To Jamie Waring!
May his neck never grow longer!
The occasion seems a little lacking in enthusiasm, Henry.
I imagined we'd meet with some slight disapproval.
At least we don't have to shoot our way in.
Whom do you wish to see?
We are waiting upon Lord Denby.
His lordship is busy, sir.
He'll be busier in a few minutes.
Mr. Ingram, these gentlemen are waiting upon his lordship.
- Gentlemen?
- I am Sir Henry Morgan.
From the looks of you, it could be nothing else.
Your Excellency, there are some gentlemen here... with muddy boots.
I have removed all my effects.
The premises are at your disposal for looting or burning.
I can appreciate your discomfort, milord.
It's not pleasant having a man you tried... to hang return as your superior.
But for the sake of the empire we both serve...
I am willing to forget your distaste of me.
The ceremony making you official governor will take place tomorrow.
I shall perform all duties required... of me as an officer of the Crown.
But my personal life is my own, sir.
It does not include associating with blackguards.
Well, Sir Henry, do we run him through hang him... from the yardarm... or start dancing the minuet?
Being governor is going to require some restraint.
There's always Maracaibo.
Get to your quarters, you blockheads! Both of you!
- What quarters, sir?
- How do I know? Find them!
Take any rooms you want.
- No, you don't! That's mine!
- I saw it first!
Oh, no, sir! No, sir!
Don't kill me! Don't kill me.
Is going. Is going.
- Pick that up.
- Yes, massa. Yes, sir.
- Pick it up!
- Yes, sir. Oh, you...
You is one of them pirates, is you?
Or... Or ain't you?
- What do I look like?
- Yes. I mean, no, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, nothing, sir. Just going... going fast.
- Stealing, eh?
- Oh, no, sir.
I was just looking for a locket that belonged to Miss Margaret.
- But it ain't here, sir. It ain't here.
- This is Lady Margaret's room?
Yes, sir.
How's her bed? Soft enough for me?
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
"And 10th, we do hereby give and grant unto Sir Henry Morgan...
"full power and authority to...
"levy, arm, muster...
"command and employ all persons whatsoever...
"residing within our said colony of Jamaica,
"to march from one place to another or to embark them...
"for the resisting and withstanding of all enemies...
"pirates and rebels, both at sea and land.
"Given at our court at Whitehall...
"the sixth day of November, 1674...
"in the 16th year of our reign.
- "God save the king."
- God save the king.
"We, duly elected to the Assembly...
"by all the peoples of Jamaica...
"renew our pledge of fealty to his most gracious...
"Majesty King Charles II...
"through the person of his appointed representative...
"His Excellency, the governor of
Jamaica, Sir Henry Morgan."
"Almighty and everlasting God...
"creator and governor of all the world...
"by whom kings do bear rule...
"and under whose providence they are wonderfully...
"and mightily...
"often times protected from many fearful dangers...
"by which the malice of Satan and his...
"imps do seek to entrap them.
"We give unto thy heavenly majesty most...
"humble and hearty thanks.
"For that it hath pleased thee of thine infinite...
"mercy and goodness in Jesus
Christ...
"so wonderfully to uphold" '...
Whew. That was the longest, dullest ceremony I ever heard.
I don't blame you for walking out.
You can lower your pistols,
Lady Margaret.
Unfortunately, I have no pistols.
Your eyes I've looked into pistol barrels that are kinder.
- Get out of my way.
- Please, do me a favor and... don't make me angry.
I'm trying my hardest to behave like a gentleman.
- A gentleman?
- Well, perhaps not entirely.
I only meant that my new character keeps me from seizing women... and hugging and squeezing them into submission.
Instead, I... I woo them with politeness... and with gifts.
Here.
Where did you get this?
I found it in your bed.
- You have my room?
- Yes.
And you haunt it sweetly each night.
Not an evening passes but I find some... new and fascinating souvenir of you... a stocking, a garter, a bit of lace.
In Tortuga, when a woman slaps a man's face... it means she wants him to grab her... overpower her and smother her with kisses.
I understand in Jamaica a gentleman must refuse such overtures.
- Out of my way.
- You're much too angry for... public appearance.
Give me your arm. A turn around the garden will cool you off.
I promise not to kiss you unless you ask for it like a lady.
Roger. Roger.
Oh. The idiot whose face I took the liberty of removing... from your locket.
Darling, I've been hunting everywhere for you.
Take me home, please.
- Has this fellow been insulting you?
- Yes.
Oh, the hero to the rescue.
It's time one of you lackeys was taught a lesson.
No, I'm under oath as a gentleman not to kill any tame rabbits.
- I'll have you for that.
- Leave the coward alone, Roger.
No, I'm going to make an example of him.
I'll run him through as a common thief.
Oath or no oath, you'll have to learn... not to offend your betters, Ingram.
Now, tell me, what the devil do you see in this weasel?
Oh, darling are you hurt?
I'm sorry. It was all my fault.
If you're in love with him, you're too big a fool for a... man like me.
You black-hearted bully.
What do you know about men or women or anything human?
All you can do is shoot and kill and prey on women... with your beastly senses slobbering at the sight of anything fine.
I repeat, my lass, you'll have to choose... between us and very soon too.
There you are, my beauty.
Seeing is believing.
Made for a queen, it was.
And easy to accommodate five... if you'll sleep them crosswise.
Come on. Get that albatross out of here.
Now, hold your fire, Jamie-Boy.
I promised her she could spend the night... in the governor's daughter's bed.
Get back to your trough, both of you.
I never thought I'd live to see
Jamie Waring play the snob.
- Get out.
- Why, Jamie...
It's a heart of stone you got!
Jamie, open the door!
She's crying her head off.
Jamie, she's crying like a baby.
Massa, does you want to put your head on this?
- What's that?
- It's a pillow, massa.
Lady Margaret's own little pillow.
She always sleeps on it.
Then take it out and burn it up.
- Yes, massa.
- Wait a minute.
Never mind.
- That's all.
- Yes, massa.
Sweet dreams, massa.
- Good morning, milady.
- You're trespassing here.
This is my land.
I set my mind on having a friendly little talk with you this morning.
Are you all right?
Why didn't you fall on the horse instead of letting the... horse fall on you?
You'd think anybody's have sense enough for that.
- Let me down.
- Well, good morning.
You've put on a little weight, as I remember.
Put me down!
- Think you can stand?
- Yes. I'm quite all right.
Easy now. You'll only start a convulsion.
There's a cozy little spot.
There you are.
Oh! Oh, you see?
You're scuttled fore and aft.
I think I'll have to put you to bed.
What?
I suggest that you lie down for a spell.
Ah. There.
- You may go now.
- Oh, nonsense.
If the eyes fill with blood, it's a sign... the head's broken.
No, they're clear.
Although they seem a little brighter than usual.
Don't touch me.
Now, my gal, I'm an expert on broken heads.
I've seen thousands of them.
Couldn't have picked a better doctor in all Jamaica.
Oh, a fine, hard skull.
Couldn't crack it with a bung-starter.
Let's have a look at your ankle.
Go find my horse!
No gentleman would think of leaving a lady at a... moment like this.
Just lie still, please, and behave yourself.
This oughta teach you to be more sociable in the future.
No bones broken.
A muscle twisted.
- Does that hurt there?
- No.
Fetch me some water, please.
I feel faint.
You may have thrown your knee out.
I ought to investigate.
No! Go fetch me some water, please!
Well, that proves what
I've always said... a woman's place is not on a horse.
There. Now, my gal, I suggest that you stay like that... until your color comes back.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to enjoy your society.
You seem much nicer than I thought.
Really, it occurs to me you probably have... a mother somewhere... a nice, gentle, old lady.
- No, she died when I was a baby.
- Possibly a sister?
No, no, no. No kith or kin.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Is that why you... I mean, why you went to sea?
- Would you like to hear about me?
- Oh, of course I would.
Well, it's quite a story.
I haven't thought about it for a long time... but I'd like to tell it to you.
I was 14, living alone in London, when... the smell of the sea got a hold of me.
I was apprenticed to an old law firm.
You're sure I'm not boring you?
- Oh, no. Not at all.
- Well...
Roger. Roger!
I give you my word on this,
Captain Leech.
I'll get you news of every English treasure ship that sails... when it's leaving and the port it's making for.
It's a pretty offer, Mr. Ingram.
The nicest, prettiest offer
I ever had... if you ain't lying or setting a trap for me.
Judge for yourself. The
Prince Consort is... due at Port Royal in three days... carrying English gold.
It'll layover first at Port Lobos to disembark passengers.
Prince Consort, eh? How many guns?
Forty.
- No escort?
- None.
We've got two ships and a hundred guns.
We could chop her into kindling.
What are you asking for this tidy piece of news?
A captain's share.
You'll hand it over to
Mr. Fenner here.
When I receive it, he'll return to you with further information... government information.
I'll send you back in a week,
Fenner, smothered... in gold. Here you are, Mr. Ingram.
You're a dead man if you're fooling... me and a rich man if you ain't.
It's the Prince Consort, all right.
Give her a blast and we'll board her.
They were waiting for us on the award side of Point Lobos... three of them.
The Black Swan engaged us first.
We fought till we were ripped to ribbons.
We lost a 130 dead, 15 of them women.
And the gold gone, every box of it!
Gentlemen, this crime is fouler than you know.
There's not only murder here, but treachery.
Go on with your tale, Captain Blaine.
There are others who could tell it better, Your Excellency.
And who are they, milord?
The friends of Pirate Leech who supplied him with the news... of where to fall upon the
Prince Consort.
Mr. Speaker, honorable members...
Leech has many old friends in Jamaica... friends in high position.
There they are. Morgan, Waring,
Graham, Blue... the whole lot of them.
Who else makes the charge that I and... my captains are traitors to the Crown?
I do. Milords and gentlemen...
I say that so long as Morgan sits as governor... so long will English ships be fed to his pirate friends.
- I call for a vote of impeachment!
- I vote for that!
Quiet! You do not vote pirates off the seas.
You engage them, rake and scuttle them.
Milords and gentlemen, we have ships, brave captains and fine crews.
How do you stand on that, lads?
Are you ready to do a little law-abiding killing for... king and country?
- It's better than none!
- You sail tomorrow night... with three ships.
- Captain Waring, take the Revenge.
- Aye, sir.
You're in command of the expedition.
Captain Graham.
- Aye, sir.
- You take the Reckless.
- Captain Higgs.
- Aye, sir.
Sail the Lady Bess. There's no ship for you,
Tom Blue.
Aye, sir. I'll first-mate Jamie.
Good.
And now, my lads, will one of you take a look in your crystal globe... and tell these lords and gentlemen where... our old friend Leech is hiding?
Ha! I can see him as plain as the nose on your face, Sir Henry.
- Tortuga!
- Right!
- And what do you think, Graham?
- I say Tortuga.
We are of a mind. That's where he always went... when he was shining with gold.
I can see him plain, standing head down in a barrel of ale... and hollering for more women.
Bottle him up in Tortuga Harbor.
Sink him, my lads!
And wipe Leech and the black flag off the seas.
You can tell these lords and gentlemen... they can rest easy in their plush chairs, Sir Henry.
I'll bring you back a necklace made of his teeth.
I told you when I took office... that I would clean the Caribbean.
And clean it I will. And if I fail, you can start your voting then.
Get to your ships, my lads, and hoist your sails!
- Aye, sir!
- Aye, sir!
Milords and gentlemen, this sitting is adjourned.
- I sent for you two hours ago.
- I come as soon as I heard, sir.
They're sailing for Tortuga tonight... three ships.
- Can you get there ahead of them?
- Easy.
I can take the tide out in an hour.
Tell Leech to get out of Tortuga... and to wait for the Royal Treasurer off St. Thomas.
She's sailing for England in a few days.
And tell Leech I know just how much she's... carrying and not try skimping my share.
- Aye, sir.
- No, thank you.
- Get on! Stretch all your canvas.
- Aye, sir.
Sorry I was so long, Roger.
Who's that? He's been bothering you a great deal lately.
Nothing troublesome, I hope?
No. The fellow wants some government work.
I told him to try Morgan.
He looks like his kind.
Finished your shopping?
Oh, there's nothing to buy in all Jamaica.
Oh, Roger, that man can it be that he's following you?
I'm certain I've seen him before.
He has the most amusing notion.
He wants to be my valet.
A valet with one ear?
- Oh, he must be a lunatic.
- He is.
Oh, it's nothing against him.
The most famous valet in
London was a lunatic.
- Oh, Roger, you jest.
- No jest. Lord Londonry's valet.
It's a good thing you're not going to London.
Oh, it's a good thing I am.
Lady Margaret, I have melancholy news for you.
The proverbial aunt whom
I've never seen... has proverbially gone to her rest... and left me a rich man, a very rich man.
Can that be the reason why you've been so gay lately?
Yes. I'm afraid it hasn't grieved me properly... to know that I can have the finest estates...
I want anywhere I choose in the Empire... and all the fancy vests in London and...
And all the crackpot servants with one ear.
I was going to speak of someone with two tiny little ears... that aren't listening.
Tortuga.
Point and a half off the starboard bow, sir.
Larboard a little.
Aye, sir.
Can you make out the harbor yet?
Not yet, sir.
Steady. Steady her up.
Steady it is, sir.
Leech will anchor his ships well inshore.
Shorten sail until the other ships come abreast.
Aye, sir.
- In gun sails!
- In gun sails! In gun sails!
Tortuga dead ahead!
- Powder on deck?
- Aye, sir.
We'll sail in until we sight them, make a larboard tack... and rake them with broadsides as we cross the harbor.
- Them's happy words, Jamie.
- Deep six and rocky!
Deep six and rocky!
Stand by with your matches ready to fire.
Stand by with your matches ready to fire.
Stand by with your matches ready to fire!
And a half seven!
And a half seven!
A quarter less eight and rocky!
A quarter less eight and rocky.
Harbor clear! Not a ship in sight!
Not a ship in sight?
Where are they?
- Slid out on us. Thomas!
- Aye, sir.
Signal the captains to drop anchor and join me aboard.
- And Thomas!
- Aye, sir.
Get ashore and do some prowling through Tortuga.
Find out what frightened
Brother Leech off.
Aye, sir.
Milords and gentlemen of the assembly... three weeks ago, our governor told us... that actions speak louder than votes.
He vowed to clear the Caribbean of its sea butchers.
And what are his actions? How has he kept his vow? I'll tell you!
Another British ship has been ravaged... and sent to the bottom by the brotherhood of the black flag.
The Royal Treasury, with 100 passengers to England... and a cargo of gold and silver valued at $1,000,000... has been destroyed, murdered and gutted!
I call again for a vote of impeachment!
And gentlemen, Morgan has proved himself... unable to meet the menace of his old friends, the pirates.
As I have suggested from the beginning... perhaps he loves them too well to bring them harm.
- Who seconds Lord Denby's motion?
- I do.
I second the motion for an impeachment vote.
Your fulminations, milords and gentlemen... are full of bilge and blather.
You can vote yourselves purple in the face, look you... but you'll not impeach me.
Before you can take me off this seat,
I hold you need a letter from the king... and before you can get a letter from the king,
I'll have Leech's head for you.
I'll serve it up to you on a platter with an apple in its mouth.
My captains will bring Leech and his buccaneers back... to Port Royal.
And I promise you this.
I'll hang a pirate in each of your bedrooms... to dangle over your heads and give you the lie.
Ah! There's your answer, you popinjays!
Captain Waring, You come in the nick of time.
Come up here, Jamie-Boy.
Now, give us the full news of your victory.
My report is of a private nature,
Sir Henry.
- I landed only a half hour ago.
- This is no time for modesty!
Out with it! Your full report.
How many of the rats did you send to the bottom... and how many did you save up to hang here at Port Royal?
We don't see any rat, neither catch them, neither killer, Sir Henry.
And that's how you keep your vow, Morgan?
Three weeks and not a pirate touched... and our fleet sailing around, quacking at the... wind like a line of ducks in a mill pond.
My lords and gentlemen,
I charge treachery.
- Right you are, Lord Denby.
- Treachery's the word.
Leech was warned of our coming.
Someone from Port Royal sent a sloop racing to Tortuga.
The same ship that brought them news of the...
Prince Consort and the
Royal Treasurer.
This is the final insult.
The brave captain hides his bungling... behind accusation against us.
I demand proof of this foul accusation.
I'll bring you proof before I'm done.
I've come back for supplies.
I'm rejoining my ships, and then we're going to search the Caribbean until we find Leech.
Where are your ships hiding now,
Captain Waring?
That I'll not answer in this place.
My lords and gentlemen... if you'll appoint me messenger,
I'll take this matter to the king.
Hear, hear.
I'm embarking for England in two days with... my bride the Lady Margaret.
They commissioned me to present the case... of Pirate Morgan, Pirate Waring and
Pirate Leech to His Majesty.
And I'll bring back the royal signature upholding the impeachment.
I move we approve the impeachment of Morgan.
I second the move.
The move for impeachment has been made and been seconded.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you to call the members.
- Lord Jarnegan.
- I vote impeachment of...
Henry Morgan.
Mr. Geoffrey Clive.
Get back to your roosts, you popinjays.
- Sir William Courtenay.
- I pronounce this sitting adjourned!
I vote impeachment of Sir Henry
Morgan, governor of Jamaica.
- Mr. Stuart Marshall.
- I vote impeachment of Sir...
Henry Morgan.
I wish my nature hadn't changed.
I'd have made that whole assembly walk the plank.
You can't go wrong drowning politicians, Henry.
No, no. We're just daydreaming,
Jamie.
How soon will you have your ship loaded, Thomas?
Another 3 hours, sir.
- You can take the tide out tonight?
- Aye, sir.
Good. It's four days to Maracaibo.
Five.
And how do you make that out, Jamie?
Because I'm not sailing tonight.
I'm sailing tomorrow night.
- And why?
- I have a call to make.
- Where?
- It's a personal matter.
You're on that tack, are you?
That idiot child of Denby's.
- Well, my lad, you leave her alone.
- I'm having a talk with her.
And getting your face slapped again!
No, Jamie-Boy, the girl's a bride tomorrow.
- Good riddance for you.
- I'm staying in Port Royal tonight!
You'll get on your ship tonight and sail... her out, or you're no captain of mine!
If I see the Revenge in port when the tide's running.
I'll board her myself.
And you can stay behind and get your... face slapped pink and blue... by as many hussies as you like!
Now, go on, Jamie-Boy.
You've got your orders.
I'll be watching your topsails.
And don't forget, it's not
Margaret with... an apple in her mouth
I want, but Leech.
I never see you like this before, Jamie.
Hanging your head like a pelican over a wench.
And if you ask me, a flouncy wench... with no more feeling than a load of clams.
If you kick her in the heart, she'll break your leg.
Aw, Jamie-Boy... there's hundreds of wenches prettier than her... all ready to leap into your arms if you give them a whistle.
- Church bells.
- Aye.
Some people likes to hear them.
I like trumpets better.
- I can see her now.
- Who?
The Lady Margaret standing up in church... tomorrow beside that goose-faced Ingram.
Hey, you're going down the wrong road, Jamie.
Will you lend a hand, Tommy?
Jamie, by land or sea, you can always rely on...
Tom Blue for wrongdoing of any nature.
What do you want?
I didn't know you were a thief and a housebreaker too, Mr. Waring.
Oh. Still barking at me, eh?
I expected to find the bride cooing, and with a soft light in her eye.
But I suppose you're saving that up for the ceremony tomorrow.
You suppose correctly.
It would be much better for both of us, me gal if I hated you as I should.
I am not interested in your emotions, Mr. Waring.
Unfortunately, I have a tender feeling for you.
Oh, I'm as annoyed with the fact as you are.
I doubt that.
Why I'm spending time on you,
I don't know.
You're as arrogant and silly a wench as ever I've run afoul of.
I don't know which I'd rather see hanging from a yardarm, you or Leech.
If you'll go now, I promise to think... over your tender declaration.
I didn't know a woman could do this to a man... make him itch to strangle her one minute... and marry her the next.
- Oh, so you want to marry me?
- We'll discuss that later.
I dislike having to call the servants to throw you out.
Look at you... hating me... and your eyes saying, "Don't go away.
"I belong to you. Make me belong to you.
"Keep me from marrying this oily little jackanapes, Ingram."
- You're mad.
- No, I've read your eyes right.
I've known too many hellcats not to know... what's behind all that blaze and bluster.
Confound it, you idiot, I'm telling you that I love you.
And you'll call me "Jamie-Boy" before... you call that stick of a man "husband."
Well, are you coming with me or not?
Your conceit, Mr. Waring, has unhinged your mind.
I warn you. Don't make me angry.
I always knew you were a nasty, vulgar rogue.
Don't touch me!
Be quiet! Lie still, I tell you!
Be quiet, or I'll crack that iron skull of yours.
You make courtship a little more strenuous than I like it.
Holy Moses! Jamie!
Grab her feet and help me get her inside.
Stand by to cast off.
You're flirting with trouble, Jamie.
Cast off, I tell you!
- Lie still.
- Giddap.
Lie still, you...
- Where's that horse blanket, Thomas?
- I'm-a sittin' on it.
I can't understand why you give her a second look.
- She's nothing to me, you fool.
- But she's mean, Jamie, and she's ungrateful.
Morgan will bellow his brains out when he hears of this.
It's for Morgan I'm doing it.
This'll keep Ingram anchored in
Jamaica and away from the king.
It'd be a lot prettier if you could put Ingram... in a sack and drown him.
I can see no good in drowning her.
I'm not drowning her, Thomas.
Not yet.
Stop your clacking and drive on.
- Potatoes?
- No, thank you.
- Meat?
- No.
- How about a little bread and cheese?
- I'm not eating with you.
- Oh, you'd rather starve, huh?
- Yes.
A little fasting wouldn't hurt you any.
Also, it might improve your manners.
My manners?
Look at it calmly. I kept you from marrying a fellow you hated.
That's a lie.
Don't argue with me while I'm eating.
I put you on a fine ship, give you the best cabin and stick... a bolt on your door.
Thanks for the bolt.
If you were really grateful, you'd tell me something.
Someone in Port Royal has been coming into a lot of money lately.
- What do you mean?
- Someone who hates Morgan... and has been playing partners with Leech... giving him information and collecting a captain's... share of the booty, or
I miss my guess.
I can tell by your change of color... that you know someone who's had a windfall lately.
- Who is it? That fine father of yours?
- No, my f...
Ingram then. Well, why don't you answer?
You're not after Leech. You would like to make me believe... something foul against a decent man!
You didn't answer me. Come in.
What is it, Thomas?
We just found a split in the main brace, Captain.
Will you have a look at it?
- A split in what main brace?
- We also located...
- a barnacle on the cathead.
- What?
- Oh, uh, I'll be right up.
- Aye, sir.
And, uh, if you want to eat behind... my back, I promise not to notice it.
There's two of them, Jamie.
It's Leech.
I knew it the minute I sighted
the topmast.
- The Black Swan.
- And the Hawk, I make it.
They've sighted us, all right.
We're no match for the pair of them.
We may as well run for it.
We can't outrun the Black Swan.
We'd be pounded to splinters in a fight.
We can't fight with 100 guns against us.
We can't fight, and we can't run.
Nothing left to do but to disappear, which ain't practical.
Run up the black flag and head her around.
We're gonna join Leech.
But you can't fool Leech with a baby trick like that, Jamie.
Hoist the Jolly Roger.
It's a beggar's chance, but our only one.
By this time, our ships are at
Maracaibo waiting for us.
We'll join Leech and lead him to Maracaibo.
He's not an easy man to lead, Jamie.
Main braces.
Back your main yards.
Come on. Get back to your cabin and stay there.
Why? So I won't see that flag and know what you are?
I'm captain of this ship, and you're taking my orders.
That's Leech and his cutthroats.
We can't fight and we can't run.
There's only one way to get out of this alive, and that's to tell Leech
I've left Morgan.
That's exactly what I thought.
Mr. Ingram is right.
You are working with Leech.
You've got a head made of iron.
Get in there and think what you want.
Come aboard, Captain. Come aboard.
And welcome.
We had a hard time finding you,
Captain.
Don't try any fancy tricks on me,
Waring.
You're under my cannon, and
I can blast you out of the... water with a wink.
You chucklehead. Do you see anything on this ship... that looks like we was planning to go into battle?
If you're smart, you'll stop jabbering and talk sense.
All right. Let's hear you make sense.
Why did you turn back?
To join you, if you're still interested in Maracaibo.
Oh. And I suppose the other ships are hunting me to join me too, eh?
I never seen a man so suspicious.
- What's your answer?
- My answer is they're after... your neck, Leech.
But I'm not with them.
I'm after gold.
Did you desert Morgan?
The way I look at it, Morgan deserted me... taking up with that pack of jackanapes.
I'm not of a mind to end up playing government... with a quill stuck behind my ear.
I stood it as long as I could.
But Morgan or no Morgan, I'm here.
You're lying, Waring, you were with him yesterday.
You told the assembly you were sailing off to capture us.
You get your tidings quickly, don't you?
Yes. And they've always been right.
You've a skull for thinking, Captain.
What else could I tell the assembly?
I've no hankering to grow on a gallows tree.
Enough of jawing. Do we sign articles or not?
There's a hole in it, Waring.
If you deserted Morgan and left... the other ships to join me... why did you go back to
Port Royal at all?
Well, come on. Out with it. Why?
To get my wife.
Oh, here you are, my dove.
These good gentlemen seem to doubt that...
I have a pretty wife aboard.
Will you come out, my sweet, and give them a look at you?
My love, may I present Captain Leech.
Madame Waring, daughter of the former...
Governor of Jamaica, Lord Denby.
Now you know why I'm not too welcome back in Port Royal.
- Captain Waring...
- Yes, my dear. What is it?
I'm pleased to meet you, ma'am.
My apologies, Captain.
I'd go back to Port Royal myself to pick up a lady of such caliber.
Then we'll forget the misunderstanding.
Do you want to join forces for profit, or shall we be on our way?
Aye, we'll sign articles.
And just to guarantee that your ship will come along to help us... you and the lady sail with me on the Swan, eh?
It'll make the trip jollier.
That's a fair bid.
But I don't fancy subjecting my wife, who is a delicate creature, as you can see... to that riffraff crew you have aboard.
Madame, you'll be treated like the queen ya are.
I promise you I'll slit the throat of the... first dog that brings a blush to you.
You can't ask for more than that, Captain.
Are you agreed or not?
Agreed.
- Mr. Blue!
- Aye, sir.
Take over. And to assure
Captain Leech... that you're an honest man... sail abreast of the Swan at all times.
Aye, Captain.
"All other officers to get one share.
"Article eight. Each captain has a right...
"to value all spoils before they are divvied up."
That's what we all agreed to at Tortuga.
Stick your name on it if you're favorable.
I'm considering...
There's no denying that you know the...
Gold Coast better than anybody on the Main.
It'd be a shame for you to waste your talents up at Port Royal.
- My share's always been 10.
- There's no arguing.
Five you'll get.
You'll nip enough out of the first 2 prizes to set you up for a year.
What's the sense of waiting around for some lumbering merchantman?
Why not hit straight for Maracaibo?
It's still the richest spot on the Spanish Main.
Maracaibo is the plum we're after picking, my lad.
Oh. I'll sign.
Stick you name right there.
Have a drink.
I'll do my drinking in Maracaibo.
Good night, gentlemen.
He's got some articles in his cabin what need signing.
Get out!
Get out!
You can't come in here!
With so beautiful a wife, they'd think it strange if I didn't.
I want to congratulate you for showing a spark of reason.
You saved both our hides, for the time being anyway.
All you got to do is keep on looking... at me with adoring eyes... and maybe we'll get out of this in one piece.
- You monster!
- Shh!
No love spats, my gal. Our friends may be listening.
Did you find out who the traitor is who warned these men?
Oh, you're not so certain anymore it's me, hmm?
I'm certain of nothing except that I'll be murdered... before I get out of this, thanks to you.
We're not dead yet, my gal.
- You can't sleep here.
- I'm afraid I'll have to.
Are you very lonesome for Jamaica?
Don't shout when you answer me.
Yes.
And you still regard me as a beast unfit for human society?
Yes.
And you're still in love with Mr. Ingram?
I said, are you still in love with that darling man?
Don't you dare come near me.
Don't worry, my gal. I won't.
Not until you call me Jamie-Boy... and ask me three times.
Be careful how you wake me up.
I'm ready to repel all boarders.
Sweet dreams.
Shh! Keep still. You'll get your throat cut.
Lie down.
What do you want?
I have come to offer me apologies.
Me oldest friend gets married, and I forget... to give him a wedding present.
It's off the Royal Treasurer.
She was on her honeymoon.
Thanks for the gift, Leech.
As pretty a sight as I ever seen.
Lawful wedlock.
There's nothing like it.
Now, that's a strange place to stick a sword right over... the bride's head.
Are you trying to make her uneasy?
Your presence is more disturbing... to Madame Waring, I assure you.
Now, Jamie, you're talking different than you used to.
I recall your trading me a gal in Portobelo... for two barrels of rum.
Of course, this one's better and worth more.
She's all in one piece. She's got two ears, no fingers missing.
Worth three barrels of rum.
Why don't you offer him five?
Don't tempt him, darling.
I might take it.
That's teaching her, Jamie.
You seem to enjoy subjecting me to... every kind of embarrassment possible.
No, my sweet. Now, don't be a snob.
We're pulling close to
Maracaibo, Leech.
You're gonna be little good to us if you keep laying your head in a... bottle every night.
I'm beginning to think you're right, Jamie-Boy.
I'm gonna need my head more than I figured.
- Get out of this bed.
- Do you think it's safe?
You didn't have to get in here.
You're very ungrateful, madame.
I'm sleeping with a pistol after this... and if you come near me,
I'll shoot you.
Here you are.
I give you permission to blast my head off... if I'm ever idiot enough to come within a foot of you.
Hey, Captain, where'd you go hiding?
- We opened another keg.
- Aw, get away!
I'm thinking.
Thinking? Thinking what, Captain?
I don't know.
I won't know until the wind's blown my head clear.
- Where is he?
- Oh, Sir Henry!
Jamie Waring! Where is that toad of a man?
- How did you come here?
- Don't mince around!
Fetch the deserter out of his hiding.
Captain Jamie dropped off to
Port Royal for supplies.
- We've had no word of him.
- Well, I will give you word of him.
He left Port Royal with Denby's puling child in a sack.
Stole her out from her home, look you, like a red Indian.
What, Captain Henry?
I am sitting in me new wig as lord of Jamaica... when 100 foaming parents come clattering... and howling for me life's blood.
- They scuttled you?
- No, I cracked a dozen skulls... and fought me way to the waterfront with the whole... of Jamaica heaving stones at me... and hid myself in a stinking load of trout.
Hoisted sail that night, and for three days...
I've been chewing raw fish.
Well, don't gape at me. Fetch me some ale before I blow away to dust!
Get out of the way there, make room for Sir Henry.
Uh, sit down, Sir Henry.
Do you think Captain Jamie has deserted, or do you... count on him coming to Maracaibo?
I am only praying that Lady Margaret does not stab him in his sleep.
For I have my own plans for him.
Aye, I've dreamed them... all the way from Port Royal.
The minute that drooling traitor sets his nose into Maracaibo...
I am taking his innards out and stringing... them to the tops of his masts.
What about Leech, Sir Henry?
Do not call me Sir Henry.
Jamaica is lost, and
'my title with it.
Our only chance of getting them back and keeping off... the king's gibbet... is to bring in the heads of Jamie
Waring and Billy Leech... with Lady Margaret in good enough repair to bespeak us... as her saviors.
Post your lookouts around the waterfront.
And wake me up at the first sign of that wench-fancier.
- Are you awake?
- Yes.
- Can you swim?
- No.
That's too bad.
- Have you ever seen a sea battle?
- No.
Well, you're gonna see one pretty soon.
A battle?
Then I'd better get dressed.
Don't look.
Me gal, I have other things on my mind for the moment.
- Who will be in the battle?
- We will.
My ships, the Reckless and the Lady Bess... are waiting for me in Maracaibo now.
Why didn't you tell me?
You've been a little critical of me ever since we started.
English ships.
Yes. Leech and his crew are sailing into Maracaibo... expecting to find a few cannon and an old stone wall.
- Instead, they're finding 100 cannon...
- Stay as you are.
Don't move or I'll blast you!
Tie them up.
Have you gone mad, you scurvy idiots?
Quiet!
- We're an hour from battle.
- I'll crack your head for you.
Put 'em down...
You lied to me about having a bride.
What else did you lie to me about?
Are your friends... waiting for me in Maracaibo?
Friends? What friends?
I've signed with you.
Aye, signed and bound, foxy Jamie.
I'm sailing the Revenge into
Maracaibo myself... under English colors, with my own crew aboard... and I'm blowing whoever's waiting out of the water... while they're still whistling and waving handkerchiefs at you.
And what's more, I'm taking the gal with me.
- I'll not go with you.
- You'll fare better with me... than with Jamie.
I promise you. I'll marry you fair and... stick no sword over your head.
He's safer out of the way now.
No, not yet. We may be doing him an injustice... and if we are, I shall want to beg his pardon.
But if we aren't, I'll wanna do more things... to him than stick him clean with a sword.
Come along, my gal.
No! Let me go! Let me go!
Now, be quiet.
You'll have to wait till after the battle for your wooing.
I promise you. If you start screaming... you'll get the flat of a sword across ya.
It's the Revenge, sir.
What are your orders?
Let her come in and moor.
But if there's a gentleman called
Jamie Waring aboard...
- bring him to me, alive if possible.
- Aye, sir.
Look at him, bringing her in like a fumbling lubber.
Forgot all he ever knew about sailing a ship.
I can't make it out.
He's sailing queer.
He is love-crazy.
That's very obliging of them... coming down... to the shore to bid us welcome.
Steady. Steady her up.
Well, you may lock me up in a hole, you varmints, but you can't sit on me.
Here's to you. Bottoms up.
You bloody jackanapes!
- They ought to be taking in sail.
- Blue must be drunk.
Roast me alive! He's coming in like he was going to blast us!
Ready! Fire!
Jamie Waring, that black-livered turncoat!
He's handed his soul back to the devil!
Get to the ships and blow the traitor to dust!
Get to the fort guns!
A broadside!
Fire!
- Hard over!
- She don't answer.
The tiller's gone.
She's gone.
Lose your sheets!
Lose your sheets!
Turn loose your braces!
Lively there!
Graham!
- Aye, sir.
- Keep pouring your fire... into the Revenge.
And get me 20 men, I'm going to board her, and with... me own hands... pull the gullet out of the mouth of that traitor,
- Jamie Waring.
- Aye, sir.
Tommy Blue!
- Tommy!
- Jamie.
All hands stand by... and when I tell you, heave the hatch cover, come out fighting.
Get ready, boys.
Here, what are you d...
Captain Leech, look!
Heave!
You blasted king's spy!
- Where is she?
- Down in my cabin.
Jamie, we finished that bunch of sea li...
I warned you myself about crossing swords with Leech.
Here. Let me see, Jamie.
Missed your gizzard by an inch.
Rather a neat hole and squirting blood like a bilge pump.
Is he done for?
Leaking a little, but on even keel, Captain.
Good. I was afraid he would be thwarting me... by giving up the ghost prematurely.
Lady Margaret, my humble apologies to you... for the foul antics of this gentleman who was once my friend.
I assure you that every indignity you have suffered... at his hands will be avenged.
I'm taking him back to Port Royal and hanging him on the... dock in chains... and there he'll dangle to brood on his crimes till he's stoned to death.
- Permit me to unfasten you.
- I don't understand you, Henry... or what you've got against poor Jamie.
I've been with him constant, glued to his side... and I've never seen him commit anything in the way of a crime... except maybe a little weak-mindedness.
He stole this innocent child from her parents' home, look you... and forced his will on her like a mad savage.
That, sir, is striking at the roots of civilization.
And he'll speak his apologies from the gibbet... to this unfortunate girl and all her kin.
- He did not steal me, Sir Henry.
- What did you say?
I came with him of my own will.
- You'll swear to that?
- Yes, on a bible.
He said he would like my company on a sea trip... and I told him I would be delighted to go with him.
I feel exceedingly grateful to
Captain Waring for... his hospitality.
The girl is mad.
Captain, we've just finished the count.
The pirates have suffered 200 killed,
70 wounded... and we've taken 130 prisoners.
- What are your orders?
- Hoist sail.
I'm going to take this mad woman back to Jamaica.
Aye, sir.
Well, we've had a nice taste of fun,
Tom Blue.
Aye. That we have, Henry.
Nothing like it to keep your ears pink.
Look you, it wouldn't take much arguing... to talk me out of Jamaica.
Who wants to be sitting around stuffed with lace... and a wig shutting the wind from your head?
Look at that sea.
And the world stretched around you like... a barrel of gold ready to drop in your lap.
It's the only life, Henry.
Say the word and the
Caribbean is yours.
Captain Waring! Captain Waring!
Clear the deck for action, Henry.
Here comes the last broadside.
Jamie-Boy, you shouldn't be out of bed.
Haven't you caused me enough trouble already?
Get back to your bunk.
Oh, Jamie-Boy.
That's only twice. Once more.
I said, three times.
Jamie-Boy.
You're not going to leave me in Jamaica?
Oh, that I don't know.
I always sample a bottle of wine before I buy it.
Come on. Let's have a sip to see if you're worth taking along.
What, no bites?
There he goes. It's the end of the Spanish Main.
