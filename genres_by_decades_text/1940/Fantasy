"What's the matter Mifanwy?"
- Nothing.
"That bad dream again?"
Sorry I woke you.
- "That's alright."
Goodnight darling.
Yes.
I had a bad dream again.
But I'm sorry.
It's mine!
- No, it's mine!
Wake up, Mifanwy. You're going to miss your train.
I've been awake for hours.
Those terrible children of yours have been up since daybreak.
Here they come. You'd better hide.
Stop pretending. We can see you're not asleep.
We've thought up some nice new things we want you to buy us in London.
Yes. We have!
- Gwendolyn!
Wait for me!
We frightened you, Daddy.
David.
Come here.
What's the matter David? Mummy will be home again tomorrow.
Is London very big, mummy?
Yes it is. It has millions and millions of people.
Will you get lost, mummy?
Mummies don't get lost, David.
Then why did you cry when the postman brought that telegram?
Go on, get out of here!
Three blind mice! See how they run!
They all run after the farmer's wife, who cut off their tails with a carving knife.
Did you ever see such a thing in your life. Three blind mice.
Well, what is it this time?
It depends what you mean, as they say.
It means my good woman, that
I can see you from where I am.
And whatever it is you're thinking, you're up to no good.
You really want to know what I was thinking?
I was thinking that first, you haven't kissed me "good morning".
And second.
That I have the best husband in the world.
For me.
Well as for the first.
Good morning.
And as for the second.
I'm very flattered, but I never did think very much of your taste in men.
I'm going to close the window, ladies.
There's a tunnel coming.
"How highly respectable they think I am .. and how happy."
"I, with my beautiful home, perfect husband and wonderful children."
"How shocked they'd be if they knew the secret of my visit to London."
"I am going to see my lover."
"Yes."
"I am going to see my lover."
"But I must go."
"Those dreadful letters coming more and more frequently."
"Threatening to break up my home."
"I've yet to tell my husband."
"No .. he wouldn't understand."
I wouldn't want him to.
"Bywaters .. Frederick."
"Executed for the murder of Mr Thompson whose wife had been his sweetheart."
See number nine. Nine.
"Thompson. Mrs."
"Executed in 1923 for the complicity in the murder of her husband."
"And was killed in her presence by her lover, a young man named Bywaters."
Forty-four .. forty-five.
"Death head of Marie
Antoinette and her husband."
Poor things.
Forty-six.
"Carrier. Jean. 1756 to 1794 .. death head."
"One of the French Revolutionists."
"He ordered over a thousand persons to be drowned in the Loire."
"He was guillotined by order of Robespierre."
Forty-seven.
"Robespierre."
Yes Paul.
I know that look.
You feel above the cut-throats and murderers surrounding you.
Don't you?
I knew that look so well.
That look of utter boredom.
You had it the first time I saw you.
I wanted to know all about you.
I wanted to know everything.
I still hear the tune they played.
The song the red-headed girl was singing.
Seven years ago.
[ Lady singing: ]
"A tinkling piano in the next apartment."
"Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant."
Anybody interesting here tonight, Jack?
One or two people you might find interesting, sir.
"These foolish things remind me of you."
"You came, you saw, you conquered me."
"When you did that to me."
"I knew somehow, that it had to be."
"The winds of March make my heart a dancer."
"A telephone would ring, but who's to answer?"
"Oh how the ghost of you .. clings."
"These foolish things."
"Remind me of you."
Look who's has dropped in.
"Dropped in" is hardly the phrase I should have chosen.
Can't see why actors don't change their costumes before coming to this place.
The first bit of real man I've seen tonight. I wonder who he is.
Paul Mangin, painter, art-critic, connoisseur.
And who are we all pulling to pieces this time?
Take a look .. standing in the entrance .. Lord Byron.
I'd say it was Sir Walter Raleigh, complete with cloak.
No .. Hamlet.
Good night sweet Prince, as far as I'm concerned.
Jack, I shan't be staying.
My hat and stick.
"Oh how the ghost of you .. clings."
"These foolish things."
"Remind me of .. you."
Would you ask him to play a waltz?
If that's what she'd like.
"Don't stare darling. Remember what mother told you: blush, and turn away."
Well, well ..
Move up.
Thank you.
Come closer ladies and gentlemen, come closer.
Yes .. the lady is alive.
See the gentle rise and fall.
Ah, that's sixpence extra.
The lady suffers from a rare disease.
You see the glazed look in her eyes. They're looking at what?
The curtains gentlemen, the curtains.
- You fool! Give me a cigarette someone.
Well, if the vigil is on for tonight I suggest we order another bottle of ..
What the management of this morgue laughingly describe as "Cognac".
We may as well go on to the Sutherlands now. We don't want to be too late.
Of course not.
Another one, Miss Conway?
That famous smile.
Oh .. one moment! I've something in my eye. Take this, get me a handkerchief.
Oh, agony .. absolute agony .. absolute agony.
Absolute agony.
Rub the other eye. Pull the eyelash over the eye.
I ask you to pull it up and clear it, you fools.
Face the light .. put your chin up.
Eye open.
There.
Perhaps you'd like to repair the rest of the damage.
I must look an awful mess.
Thank you .. Mr Mangin.
You know my name. I don't know yours.
Mifanwy .. Mifanwy Conway.
Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Drink?
- No thank you.
Mifanwy .. then you're Welsh.
That accounts for your black hair.
I'm actually not. My mother was Italian.
Italian?
You seem to like that.
And you?
I'm a mixture of so many nationalities
I can truthfully say I belong to none.
Well you're an artist, aren't you.
- In a way.
An artist is supposed to belong to nowhere in particular.
But to the world.
I've never wanted to belong to the world. I'm careful to try to avoid that.
Do I look as if I belong to the world?
Well no .. not to this world.
Not exactly.
It's rather stuffy in here.
There's a little garden-place outside.
I was waiting to come again after our dance. I decided not to come too soon.
Now, I mustn't stay too long .. goodnight.
Alright?
Well, how did ..?
- Shut up.
Well.
Better order the bottle I talked about in the lucid moment I had a few minutes ago.
You'd better, before you fall flat on your face amongst the broken glass.
You'd better get to that party.
You don't want to be too late.
Aren't you coming, Mifanwy?
No. Another time.
I think I'll go home.
You need a taxi, Miss?
No thank you Harry. It's a lovely night. I think I'll walk.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight Miss.
Mifanwy.
I thought it was you. Have you ever ridden in a Hansom before?
Yes .. long ago.
You must have been very little then.
Would you like to try it again?
I like the way you dress.
It's not like everybody else.
I shouldn't call you altogether .. conventional.
Don't you think it may be a mistake if I were to send you home at this moment?
I'd like you to see my house.
It might interest you.
Would you care to continue the adventure?
Yes .. I would.
Drive us home, Mortimer.
- Very good sir.
Would you wait, Mortimer.
There's no key. The Florentines liked mechanical gadgets.
Come along.
"As we came in, I could feel somehow that it was watching me."
"And even now, after all these years."
"I can still remember this house of his in Regent's Park."
"Perhaps if I saw it today, it would seem much smaller, and more ordinary."
"And everywhere the scent of flowers."
"So strong, so sickly-sweet."
"That I felt almost suffocated."
I really ought to explain. You see, there is no-one here except myself.
I keep my staff out of view as much as possible.
I like to attend to the needs of my guests myself.
Girls?
I very rarely invite anybody to my home.
It has to be the appropriate person.
You need not come any further unless you wish.
I wish.
I strongly advise you not to, unless you feel the inclination.
Oh, I feel the inclination.
You've no idea how much. Ha ha.
"It was then, for the first time, I was to learn .."
"Of the strange affect that laughter had on Paul Mangin."
How do you like this room?
Highly effective.
Thank you.
I never quite thought of it like that.
Oh, how intriguing.
What's that? In the scent bottle? It must be very old.
It is.
The scent is still there.
The scent of an age to which you really belong.
It smells of musk, and thyme and amber. Juliet might have used it.
Not Juliet .. the Borgias, with their lusts, and passions and murders.
I'm glad you like the little scent bottle.
It happens to be one of the most lovely things in the house.
You've got very good taste.
I should have said that of you.
It means something more than mere taste.
It's an attitude towards life.
A Hansom cab, 1066 and all that?
A Hansom? I have the courage of my convictions.
Did you enjoy your ride?
- It was a novelty.
I was very disappointed that none of my friends passed in a car and saw us.
No doubt, you wonder why I surround myself with an atmosphere of the past.
It's not exactly what you think, Mifanwy.
Most people think they were born before their time ..
I'm after mine.
Everybody wants to belong to the future.
Nobody wants to belong to the past.
Except me.
But perhaps you'll be there with me sometimes.
I hope you like this.
You know, you mustn't think that.
I belong neither to the past, nor the future.
I'm up to the minute, neither a second behind or beyond it.
The present.
Whether you like it or not, we are all products of the past.
Even the present you think you belong to, will soon become the past.
We don't know if the future will be good or bad, but we gamble on it.
But I've given up gambling.
I prefer a certainty.
The past.
Tell me something.
Remember you said after our little waltz, that you dare not come too soon.
That you mustn't stay too long.
What did all that mean?
I've always found that whenever I'm very attracted to anything or anybody.
I always move very slowly in the opposite direction.
You know ..
Mentally, I pushed back that curtain at the nightclub many times ..
Before I actually went there again.
Though it was difficult to keep away.
The chance was worth taking.
What chance?
The chance that you might be interested.
Some more wine?
Only .. interested?
Interested at first.
I'm going to set out to charm you.
Lots of men have tried that.
It's my form of seduction, if you like.
Strange.
No man of any shape or kind I've yet met ..
Has ever suggested charm as his entire plan of campaign.
Very well .. charm me.
You don't understand me.
I mean my ideas.
My way of looking at things. My ..
Attitude towards life.
That's a new approach.
Don't you like this wine?
Oh.
Alright. Show me round.
Show me your studio.
I don't paint any more.
- Why ever not?
Have you noticed this?
It should interest you.
Do you recognize it?
- I'm ashamed. Should I?
Is it so famous? It's a mirror.
Has it a special significance?
Only for me, Mifanwy.
I'd like you to have it.
- I couldn't.         - Please.
It would give me a particular pleasure if you'd accept it.
Paul.
I don't know what you put in that wine you gave me.
I'd swear I've just seen a white cat.
In the mirror.
- Cat? Nonsense.
I did .. there!
Get out .. get out!
Get out!
A lovely cat.
I do apologize .. I'm afraid I've ..
Well ..
I really must be going.
I promised to have an early night.
And it's getting rather late.
But I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I really did.
Please don't go yet.
It's not really very late.
Stay and have another glass of wine.
Well .. maybe.
Perhaps it is a little late.
I'll get you your cloak.
You've been interested, I hope.
Yes .. enormously.
Enormously.
I'm glad.
Mifanwy I wanted to call it.
But the natives couldn't pronounce it, so they gave it a new name: Devil Girl.
Particularly suitable.
Your prejudiced in her favor because she's your daughter.
Sir David Conway, the over-indulgent father?
I wonder what the quivering prisoners at the bar ..
Who think I've the hardest heart on the bench would think if they saw me now.
Well she certainly keeps the most fantastic hours.
You know sir, it's none of my business but ..
Don't you think this night-club life is rather bad for a young girl?
Well, let me put it this way.
The gawky schoolgirl that you remember has turned into something of a beauty.
Just that.
I say, that's rather a fine peak.
Oh, I'm not very worried about her.
The young people she runs with are all like her.
Just marking time, waiting for something to happen to them.
Here we are. End of film.
And so we say .. farewell.
Owen Rhys.
- My dear girl.
Well, say something.
Preferably something about me.
Well, four years in the wilds hasn't exactly improved my small talk.
Well .. have I changed?
Said she, expecting the answer "Yes".
No .. you still have a brace on your teeth.
And I can't see your legs but I expect you're still knock-kneed.
And quite honestly between you and me ..
Your nose is still very shiny.
Oh you beast .. you're probably right.
Well go on talking about your life in the wild or the bush or wherever it was.
Well, I'm home for a short time, and then away for a couple of years.
I think that's all.
Why do grown men do these things?
To get away from young women who write poems.
I have still got that one about
"love and dove" you knocked up.
I find you quite terrifying.
- Flattering, quite flattering.
How do you turn this infernal thing off, Owen?
Unorthodox, but effective.
I think I'll leave the infernal machine until morning.
Of course. Goodnight Ed.
- Goodnight.
Nice of you to have looked in on us first.
I'll see you to the door.
I hope we see a lot of each other.
That would be lovely. Goodnight Owen.
Goodnight Mifanwy.
I want a word with you, young woman.
I'm frightfully tired, David.
Can it wait?
No .. come here.
Nearer.
What's that great thing you've got on around your neck?
Now David.
This is not the quivering prisoner at the bar.
This is your spoiled beauty of a daughter.
Remember her?
Now stop being foolish.
I want to look at it .. here.
You weren't wearing this when you went out this evening.
He came tonight.
- Hmm.
This is a priceless piece of Renaissance work.
You can't go accepting valuable presents like this.
Who is this man anyway?
Oh, someone I met in a nightclub weeks ago.
Your tie is crooked.
- You ought to have got over it by now.
Your affairs don't usually last this long.
No .. this is something different.
I find him attractive, David.
Madly attractive.
Don't ask me anymore.
This is my own secret .. for the moment.
It only matters that I am the chosen companion of the most ..
Extraordinary man in the whole of London.
Possibly in the whole world.
Alright Mifanwy, you shall keep your secret.
But you won't keep this.
You shall take this back tomorrow.
To your .. uh ..
To your most extraordinary man in the whole of London.
Paul?
Paul?
Paul.
Stop joking.
Where are you?
Paul?
Very beautiful.
But this is hardly in character.
Now we must do the finishing touches.
Jewellery is missing.
So is the headdress.
How wonderful.
Do you mind me wearing this costume?
- I've collected them over some years.
Just for this occasion.
Oh .. surprising how it fits me.
It isn't surprising at all.
In future, you'll find all the matching jewellery in the opposite cupboards.
Is that right?
I hope so.
You know Paul.
Since the moment I entered this house.
I can't help feeling that I've left the other Mifanwy back at the nightclub.
This one is someone, entirely different.
You are someone entirely different.
"Yes .. I was becoming someone entirely different."
"I was beginning to think like him, speak like him."
"Feel like him."
"Paul was turning me into someone I couldn't understand."
"The weeks passed. He took up all my time and energy."
"And yet, there was never any undue pressure in Paul's hold over me."
"All day long there was the sensation of being imprisoned in a different world."
"It was as if I wanted to get away .. and couldn't."
"Even in my sleep, he would be there, in the corridor of mirrors."
"Watching me, dressing up for him."
"I was becoming like a wax doll."
"All head and shoulders."
What's in the letter Caroline?
Since you're so anxious to tell me.
And it is addressed to me. What's in it?
Since you're so anxious to know.
Your favorite client, Mr Paul Mangin.
Is giving a ball .. a masked, fancy-dress ball next month. Here.
He wants you to make a particular dress for a lady.
The design is enclosed.
It could be for Miss Mifanwy Conway.
Could be.
That man knows what he wants.
These are quite perfect.
She hasn't been seen at the club now for some time, has she?
Neither has he, my pet.
Do you think I haven't noticed the look in your eyes whenever he's around?
It makes me sick.
I could always tell the moment he came into the club.
Even your voice would take on a hungry note.
Like a yowling cat on the tiles.
Tell me Edgar, if you hate him so much.
Why have you slaved on these dresses all these years?
Why do you crawl to him?
Why do you lick his boots?
Or maybe that's become a habit .. hmm?
[ Telephone ]
The reason is simple, my pet.
I am an artist.
He appreciates my artistry.
And pays well for it.
Hello?
Oh, alright, show him up quickly .. yes, quickly.
I hope I'm not too early.
No, Mr Mangin. I'm at your service at any time of the day.
I received your designs.
They're quite perfect.
Piranesi probably thought so, when he originally designed them.
I want all these costumes kept in the same style.
Venetian school.
I leave the choice of materials to you, but they must be kept simple.
May I make a few suggestions?
I'm still here you know.
I beg your pardon. I didn't see you.
There was a time when you came to the club ..
When you couldn't look at anyone else.
I wasn't looking at you my dear.
I was merely interested in the play of light on your red hair.
I'm amazed at the vulgarity of an age that can produce such a type as yours.
This fancy-dress ball of yours.
I'm looking forward to it.
- Afraid only my friends are invited.
Mr Mangin, perhaps you'd care to look at kind of velvet?
Oh Edgar.
I was just trying to explain to Mr Mangin ..
That the costumes might not be ready in time.
Unless.
Is that also your condition, Orsen?
Yes.
Sorry, Mr Mangin.
I'll arrange to have the costumes sent for.
[ Musical chimes ]
Who put that on?
- Must be the young lady, sir.
She asked me not to tell you she'd arrived.
I think she wanted it to be a little surprise for you.
Will you be needing me again tonight, sir?
No, you can go Mortimer.
I will see the lady home.
It's good to see you so happy, sir.
Haven't seen you like this since Italy.
The day you brought the picture home.
That's ten years ago, Mortimer.
A long time.
Yes, it is a long time, sir.
Perhaps this might be the right moment to ask how much longer I've got to ..
Wear these fancy clothes.
I'm getting a little tired of the way the trades-people keep laughing at me.
Even the girl in the Grocers calls me Mr Pickwick.
You should be honoured Mortimer.
Pickwick was Dickens's favorite character.
Pickwick?
Pickwick?
Charming.
Please don't laugh.
You love dancing, don't you.
Well, I've something here that might interest you.
I've arranged a ball specially for you.
You'll be able to dance all night long.
I've invited all the most famous and infamous people in London.
But Paul, how wonderful .. for me?
How do you know they'll all come?
They'll come alright.
If only out of curiosity.
For one night, you and I will be in our proper setting.
Venice - 400 years ago.
Mind your dress.
- Sorry.
You know the little piece of canal that goes through my grounds?       - Yes.
There it is, the Grand Canal.
The dancing, the ballet.
Canale Del Latte.
But a detail will be missing from the age to which you really belong.
That should make you happy Mifanwy.
What have you chosen for me to wear?
I'll tell you about that after dinner.
I don't know what I should do if you were to die.
An odd thing to say ..
I should have nothing left to live for.
Do I mean so much to you, Paul?
One day you'll realize how much.
Still raining?
I'm afraid it is .. and
Mortimer isn't back yet.
Paul.
Would you think it very "20th Century" if I invited myself for the night?
I'm really awfully tired.
Have you a guest-room?
I have, but I'm afraid I can't supply the chaperone.
I should hate to answer the door to an irate father shouting for my blood.
Daddy is on holiday in Wales.
Good .. I have a horror of bloodshed.
Especially my own.
No-one has been in this room before.
It was waiting for you.
Goodnight Mifanwy.
My name is Veronica.
Won't you come down?
Sit down .. Mifanwy.
You know my name?
- Oh yes.
I know everything about you.
Naughty, naughty, Duchess.
This time you've given me away.
So whenever I saw the cat ..
You were near.
- Oh yes.
Many were the times I wished that I could talk to you.
You wondered how I knew your name?
I heard him say it.
It sounds beautiful from his lips.
I don't understand.
Paul told me there was nobody else in the house.
For him, there is no-one.
You will have some tea?
But you had many opportunities of talking to me, when I was alone.
How could I know that he wouldn't suddenly appear?
You know how he can appear quite suddenly from nowhere.
But I can always watch you without his knowing.
I have a way of flitting from room to room and about the corridors.
Like a ghost.
Sugar?
Very often, I thought that you would discover me.
What would happen if Paul were to find out that you had spoken to me?
He would throw me out.
What's he afraid of?
How old do you think
I am? The truth now ..
About .. fifty?
That's what he's afraid of.
That you might find out, why a woman of thirty should ..
Look like me.
I'll not listen to you anymore!
I don't believe a word of it.
Oh but you must.
You don't want to become like me .. do you?
Listen .. he found me in Italy during the war.
I'd lost my home, and my family.
I was very beautiful. He was very rich.
He said.
That I was what he had been searching for.
He promised .. that I should be the mistress of this house.
That I should never want for anything.
That I should have all the clothes and jewels that I wanted to wear.
I did .. every day I was dressed up in them.
He never allowed me go outside the house as he said it would spoil the illusion.
And then ..
He got tired of me.
I was banished below stairs.
You could have run away and left him.
For years, I've been a prisoner in this house.
I didn't know a soul.
Since that time, there's been a long procession of girls.
But I always warn them .. in time.
You think he loves you, don't you?
He loves only himself.
It isn't true .. it isn't true.
Paul didn't force me here.
I came and stayed of my own free will.
Of his will.
He's clever .. he makes you think it is your own will.
He's like a drug.
He makes you see life his way.
And you have to go on, as if you stop, you'd find the world so cruel and ugly.
That you would have to go crawling back to him again.
No .. no .. no .. no!
No .. no .. no .. no ..
"Must get out of this house."
"I must change these clothes."
"I must get out.."
- "It's like a drug."
"He makes you see life his way."
"There's been a long procession of .."
"Go crawling back to him again."
Come in, Mifanwy.
You've found out where I work.
Come here and tell me what you think of my designs for the musician's costumes.
I found them in this old book.
Paul.
Is it true about the other girls?
Did they also have black hair like mine?
Did you dress them up as well?
So Veronica has been talking to you.
So it is true.
Everything she told me is true.
You haven't a hold over me.
What are you talking about Mifanwy?
You haven't a hold over me.
You can't make me become like her, or a slave like all the others.
See .. you can't deny anything.
I've seen how she looks.
I thought she was an old woman.
That's why you kept her hidden.
Because you made her what she is.
She looked as she does now when
Mortimer first found her in the street.
She's a poor creature, with the mind of a child.
Don't lie to me.
You know you found her in Italy.
She doesn't sound mad at all.
She's afraid of you Mifanwy, as a child would be afraid.
Her obsession is, that with you coming here, she will be turned out.
Why should she be afraid of me?
She also warned the others.
There were no others.
I don't believe you.
Aren't I almost a prisoner?
You've done everything you could to keep me away from people.
I was afraid of losing you .. because you are the one I've been waiting for.
Afraid of losing me .. no!
In his untiring quest ..
The well-known connoisseur Paul Mangin ..
Discovered her in a rather expensive curio shop, took her home and ..
Found she was the exact shape and colour to fit his unique collection of costumes.
But this marionette has got tired of the role, before you got tired of her.
Paul, I don't intend becoming one of those dolls in your cupboards.
I'm getting out of this toyshop.
- Wait!
Mifanwy .. I've no power to hold you.
What I'm going to tell you may seem puzzling and strange to you.
You may wonder why I haven't told you before.
You're young, and I wanted to be sure that you are ready to accept a miracle.
I don't believe in miracles.
Don't you Mifanwy?
Then what's this?
It's wonderful .. when did you do this of me?
"Portrait Of A Lady".
Attributed to Cristobano Laurie.
I don't understand.
I was in a castle in Italy, after the last war.
Wounded, with a shell-splinter in my head.
All the times I lay in bed, she looked down at me.
In the nights, I dreamed about her.
She filled my imagination.
After the war, I went back to England.
I found no peace and no happiness.
That girl's face haunted me.
She drew me back to Italy.
I had to possess her.
The day I bought her.
An infinite peace and happiness came over me for the first time in my life.
I was determined to find out who she was.
They let me search in the archives at the castle. Then I discovered her name.
"Venetia".
Then something very strange happened.
I became conscious of knowing events in her life before I had read about them.
If felt that somehow, somewhere ..
I'd known her before. That mirror in her hand. I felt I'd given it to her myself.
I've always laughed at the idea of reincarnation.
But this had happened to me.
So I was bound to believe it.
By now, I was convinced that
I had lived 400 years ago.
That I had been Venetia's lover.
You are Paul Mangin, living here and now.
How could you believe you're that man?
- Yes, how could I believe?
One part of the puzzle was missing.
That part ..
Was me.
You believe that I'm that girl.
That smile.
It's mocking .. cruel.
Yes, I always hated her smile.
I wonder what she was thinking?
She was cruel .. she was faithless.
I could have changed her.
But she left me.
You speak as if you were really there.
- As if?
I was there I tell you. I was there!
This time, you won't leave me, Venetia.
No .. I won't leave you.
No, Paul.
I won't leave you.
"It wasn't easy to lie to Paul. To leave him."
"But I knew in that moment."
"That if I didn't,
I would never be able to."
"It wasn't so much Paul who frightened me."
"But what I knew was happening to me."
"And most of all."
"I wanted to be able .. to laugh again."
[ Laughter ]
[ Laughter ]
So you are happy here, aren't you?
Very happy. I never want to leave.
Mifanwy.
- Hmm?
Have you ever been in love?
Oh, a thousand times, but never in love.
Both cynical and sad.
- And true.
Here, move over. You use your wrist more in your cast.
Is that better?
- No. Dreadful.
Do you think you ever could be?
In love?
- Yes.
I could be.
But not like the other thousand times?
I'd want it to be different somehow.
- A thousand and one?
Days and nights.
Heavens! What a country to live in.
No wonder Welshmen are always miners.
It's far better than living above ground.
Still, I wouldn't live anywhere else if you paid me.
Now you run up and change your clothes.
I'll get you a hot drink .. here.
Shall I bring your own shoes and socks?
- They're in the top right-hand drawer.
Heavens.
Any more of this hunting, shooting and fishing business and I'll be an expert.
Imbecile woman.
What's the matter darling? Bad news?
Owen, I've got to go back to London.
It will only be for a few days, but I've got to go back.
Disappointing .. even for a few days.
Perhaps it's because of you that I've got to go back.
I can't explain it.
It wouldn't make sense.
Nothing you do say makes much sense.
You see .. I could never marry someone.
With the shadow of another man always beside me.
This shadow. You're sure you were right the other day when you said ..
"A thousand times and never in love".
It's always so difficult to explain, isn't it?
Perhaps I should have said I never .. loved anyone before.
So glad you were able to come.
- Delighted!
My dear, what we've missed by him hiding himself all these years.
It must have cost him thousands.
I hear that Sir is completely crackers.
I wonder if there is a woman he adores?
Did you hear that Caroline?
He wants to know if Paul has done all this for the woman.
You ought to know, dear Edgar.
You made the dress.
Well, it's getting late and I haven't seen it anywhere.
Don't worry, you will.
Even if, according to The Tatler ..
"Mifanwy Conway is spending a quiet holiday in Wales .."
"With the ever so eligible mister Owen Rhys."
"The distinguished explorer."
Somehow, I doubt if Paul
Mangin reads The Tatler.
Then, don't think dear Edgar, that someone should tell him?
Hello Paul.
Looking for someone?
You are looking nice, my sister Lucrezia Borgia.
Is that intended as a compliment?
Just as you like. She's as handsome as you are Caroline, and just as dangerous.
And what do I do to live up to her reputation?
Start out by poisoning a dozen lovers or so.
Lead me to the bar, I'll start at once.
I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere for your first victim.
I knew you would come.
Good evening Miss Conway.
- What a lovely costume, Mortimer.
Yes, I'm afraid I make more noise than a ruddy fire-engine.
Begging your pardon, Miss.
I would have one of those if I were you.
- I never take it, sir.
[ Man singing: ]
"Black .. black .. black .. is the colour of my true love's hair."
"Her lips are something wondrous fair."
"The purest eyes and the daintiest hands."
"I love the grass whereon she stands."
"I grow too troublesome."
"To mourn, to weep."
"But satisfied, I ne'er can sleep."
"I'll write her a letter in a few little lines."
"I'll suffer death a thousand times."
Well, that's all I have to show you.
You've given them something they'll never forget, Paul.
Until some bright, young thing comes and shows them something even more amazing.
But you'll remember, won't you?
- Yes.
I'll remember.
It's getting rather cold.
Let's go inside.
Stop Paul. Stop!
Well .. it's all over.
Not for us.
Give me your hand.
- Whatever for?
It's an engagement ring.
You don't like it?
How very amusing.
It's awfully .. cute.
It's just like hers. Don't you see?
Just like hers.
Oh for goodness sake Paul.
Stop this nonsense.
This bringing of something of the present back into the past.
Or the past back into the present.
Whichever way you put it.
It's becoming a bit of a bore.
Have you got a cigarette?
I'm absolutely panting for one.
Oh I'm forgetting.
We don't smoke, do we.
What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
It's just that I have the courage to tell you the truth at last.
You set out to charm me, as you put it.
Well, you succeeded.
I was attracted to you.
I like dressing up. What woman doesn't?
I was in the mood, it was a novelty.
You played up to my vanity.
Yes of course.
It was my vanity which made me take part in all this madness.
But when you showed me the picture of this woman, and told me that I was her.
Then things became a bit too complicated, Paul.
So I went away for a rest-cure.
Why did you come here tonight?
Curiosity .. that was all.
I don't believe it. You came because you had to .. because I was here.
You came because we can't live apart from each other.
I'm sorry .. but really.
Just because you're dressed up as a Borgia, doesn't make me Venetia.
Look. Ours was a very charming, unique affair.
That was all.
I never intended anything serious.
I love someone else.
I'm going to marry him.
So, you laughed when
I told you my story.
You thought it was very funny.
She laughed too.
I should have known that four centuries cannot change a woman's soul.
A pity Mifanwy that you inherited not only her beautiful body.
But also her worthless heart.
Alright Paul.
I'm Venetia .. heart and all.
Didn't you say she went off with another man?
See?
We've both completed the full cycle of our destinies.
Not quite.
I didn't tell you the end of her story.
As I hoped yours might be different.
But it's not going to be Mifanwy.
It's not going to be.
You see, he loved her hair.
It was so dark and mysterious.
He strangled her with it.
Do I still make you laugh, Mifanwy?
Do I still make you laugh, Mifanwy?
Venetia!
Mifanwy!
[ Hysterical laughter ]
[ Hysterical laughter ]
[ Hysterical laughter ]
Oh darling, don't look so disappointed.
Aren't you glad to see me?
- Why haven't you gone home?
Yes, I know. I'm completely plastered.
In fact .. I nearly passed right out.
Oh, don't let that little society bitch get you down.
I love you .. do you hear?
You've always treated me like dirt.
Well I am a tramp.
But I like it.
Don't look at her, look at me!
You've never said a kind word to me.
You despise me.
I suppose you think I'm not good enough for you?
[ Man singing: ]
"Black, black is the colour of my true love's hair."
"Her lips are something wondrous fair."
Caroline!
Caroline!
Caroline!
Caroline!
Caroline!
Mortimer has come back.
There are two gentlemen with him.
Caroline Hart has been murdered.
Why did you do it, Mr Mangin?
Why did you do it, Mr Mangin?
Veronica.
Can you tell the gentlemen I'll be ready in 5 minutes for them to take me away.
Yes, Mr Mangin.
Only five minutes, Miss.
Why have you come?
Let me tell them.
- There's nothing to tell.
Yes there is.
About you .. and me .. and Venetia.
That must never be told.
It would help to save you.
From what? The lunatic asylum?
Can you imagine me in a padded cell?
I, who've always surrounded myself with beautiful things.
Jewels .. pictures.
The sound of music.
The touch of a woman's hair.
Sorry, not quite the most tactful thing to have mentioned.
Don't you want to live?
Do you love me, Mifanwy?
No ..
Then there's no need for me to defend myself.
You see, before I was searching for someone.
I know I must have seemed mad and frightening to you.
But have you ever thought that everyone, from the very minute he's born.
Is searching for something.
Most people die without even knowing what it is.
I knew .. so I'm one of the lucky ones.
But .. Paul ..
All sorts of people before me have tried to live outside their time.
Quite futile.
There is a time to be born.
And a time to die.
So please don't spoil the exit I have chosen for myself.
You ought to know .. I always had a liking for dramatic effects.
Goodbye, Paul.
- Au revoir, Venetia.
Bring up Paul Mangin.
Paul Mangin, you are charged that on the night of September 3rd 1938 ..
You wilfully murdered Caroline Hart.
Under this indictment, what do you plead?
Guilty My Lord.
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
My Lords the King's Justices do strictly charge and command all persons ..
To keep silence while sentence of death is passing on the prisoner at the bar ..
On pain of imprisonment.
God save the King.
The sentence of the court is that you be taken from here to a lawful prison.
And hence to a place of execution.
To there be hanged by the neck until you be dead.
And your body be afterwards buried within the precincts of the prison.
In which you have been confined before your execution.
May the Lord have mercy upon your soul.
Amen.
"Paul Mangin .. the masked-ball murderer."
"Strangled Caroline Hart with her own hair. Executed October .."
Oh yes, I remember reading about that in the News Of The World.
Good afternoon Miss.
Mortimer!
Not quite as we knew him, is it?
So it was you who sent the telegram?
Yes, Miss .. uh Madam.
You see, I discovered Veronica had found your address and was writing those ..
Threatening letters you've been getting.
Veronica?
Madam, do you believe he did it?
No.
Not always.
Mortimer.
Why should Veronica now wish to blackmail me?
That was why I sent for you.
Veronica's always been a little queer, Madam.
She was like that when I found her and brought her home.
From Italy?
Oh no. That was her story.
He realized that she was mad and it wasn't safe for her to be out alone.
But lately she's got worse.
She is mad .. dangerously mad.
I sent you the telegram as I was afraid you might take action against Veronica.
The poor Master's name would be dragged through the mud again.
Oh Madam .. I wanted to implore you not to do that.
Because I am .. having
Veronica put away.
Yes, I'm having her put away.
He never wished that but ..
Every evening, just as it's getting dark she disappears.
A few days ago, I followed her here.
Always at the same time.
Just as this place is going to close.
She wanted to have a few words with him alone.
[ Tannoy: ]
"Come along ladies and gentlemen."
There she is now.
"Hurry along ladies and gentlemen.
We're closing down."
"Hurry along, please."
"Hurry along, please."
I'm late Paul .. we haven't much time.
That old fool, he will keep spying on me.
He pretends she's not in the house.
But I know she is there.
I hear her every night. Laughing and dancing in the corridor.
I hear the music-box playing.
Last night ..
I went after her.
But she fled and hid in the guest-room.
She knows I'm frightened of going there.
But one night.
I won't be.
I couldn't see the last time.
It was too dark.
I couldn't see if she had red hair.
It was the one with the black hair I wanted.
She's here, Paul.
The one with the black hair.
She still uses the same scent.
Why did you let him die, Veronica?
So that you couldn't have him.
Where are you?
You won't find me Veronica.
You won't be writing any more letters to me.
Yes, get to know those faces Veronica.
Soon, yours will be one of them.
Look at your own handiwork.
You say you loved him.
But you've turned him into an effigy of horror and wax.
No good running away, Veronica.
No good running away.
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
Don't look Miss .. turn away.
You go now, Miss.
I'll see to everything.
Mortimer I ..
- Please, Miss.
The Master would wish it.
Alright, Mortimer.
[ Tannoy: ]
"Come along ladies and gentlemen .. all out please."
Thank you, Mortimer.
Hello mummy! Mummy!
- Hello.
What have you got for us?
Hello. What's in the that box?
Hello darlings, darlings.
I've got lots of presents for you .. of course I have.
Well, how did you get on?
I had a very busy time, darling.
I spent more than I ought to have done.
I bought you a new dressing gown to match mine.        - Thank you.
How have the children been? Good?
How's the garden? The tulips out yet?
Well darling, you haven't been away a year you know.
I went into Madame Tussauds.
- Really?
You know.
They've got Paul Mangin there.
The man who strangled a woman with her hair.
Funny you should mention that.
There was a thing about him in the paper this morning.
He didn't do it at all.
His old housekeeper co駀essed just before she died.
She'd thrown herself in front of a lorry or something.
You're lucky to h鋠e seen him.
I expect they'll take him out of Tussauds now.
They will?
He must have been a very attractive person.
Didn't you think so, Mifanwy?
T-G 
- What's wrong?
- I have hungry.
Before dinner!
- The road is cut!
My appetite is not!

- Not so close!
Those smugglers!
Fantastic!
- It's a blessing for them, riding on the border!
The man who paid the office...
...here is a naive.
So what is it?
- Nothing, absolutely nothing.
- Does not that prevent us...
...to dinner?
- The end of history, notary!
- Where were you?
- When the old man...
"Your horse knows the way... "
- So you hear steps outside and someone knocks at the door.
This is not like me!
- Hotel Abbaye?
- Yes?
- Do you have a room?
- Is it just you?
I hope so... Close the door!
What do you with my hand?
Never had seen a stump?
- Why has the way?

Cubriré la ficha, después me enseñará mi cuarto.
"Roland Brissot...
"35 years... "
Anything else?
- No, sir.
- "Artist"... That´s right!
- Duration of stay?
- A strange question! Do you know what will tomorrow? I do not!
Show me my room.
- Over here, sir!
- Curious guy!
- Perhaps a lunatic!
One did not want to find it only!
- Ladies, gentlemen! Have you seen a man...
...very strange, in black, carrying a large box?
He was shot down.
- If you were here!
- It is a traveler, but not corresponds to the description.
- A small one... man... in black?
- No distinction was made very well, appeared to have light behind.
- Met with him?
- No.
- Come on, Nick!
- Want a drink?
- No, the service... Even without the man, find the box.
Good night!
- Do you show your room?
Serve dinner.
I do not have time, I must go.
Where are the ruins?
- Go tomorrow, at day.
- Maybe for you.
I´m wait. Here and there!

- I have no hunger!
- Strange!
It was not what he feared the dog! its close doors locked tonight!
- Again chickpeas?
- Did not lower?
You need to eat! "Primum vivere".
- How to paint with your hand?
- No, nor could the two!
- Clemence, making the chickpeas!
- Yeah, mom!
- An avalanche!
- A mad!
- And the chickpeas!
Lost night!
- Will you stay?
- As a trunk, lady!
- I sleep dressed!
- There he is!
- Will lost his hand in war?
- What's in that package?
- A memory of his wife?
- You have to keep looking drugs!
How about 1 kg. heroin?
- Mr. Brissot, call him by phone!
- Me?
- Yes, "Mr. Brissot".
But nobody knows that...
- I asked for you, with great courtesy.
Many courtesy!
Hello!
Hello?
Who is it?
What do you want?
Hello!
Again!
What?
- Watch out for the glasses!
- I cannot see, Mimí!
- The light!
- Clemence, where are you?
- Candles, Ms. Denis!
- Watch,
I choke with chickpeas!
- The light!
- The light!
Do not push!
Does it want to leave my nose?
- Clemence, do not be afraid!
- This is too much! If I plunder the one that is allowed...
... this gesture with my wife...
- I have a painful kick...
... in the butt.
- I got the crooked nose!
- What?
- I don´t know.
They skipped the leads, no doubt.
- Hello, hello!
- The fuses are intact!
Must be the Central.
And the phone?
Dead.
- It came from the Central?
- Hello?
Already phoned.
Come to Central!
- Yeah, and the kick...
... on my back too?
- I have stolen!
Who robbed me?
He had left there. Who did it?
- We have not seen anything!
- We were in the dark.
- After the shots...
- But, what happened?
Your box!
Has disappeared.
- It's essential to call the police!
- When we remain in the dark, the gentleman was in another place!
- Where are the fuse!
- Are intact.
- What if we said what containing that package?
It's so amazing!
- We're accustomed to notary stories!
- I can not.
- The police!
No, wait!
The police can not do anything.
Nobody can do anything for me.
Not a policeman.
- Not a colonel?
- I´m afraid not.
Well!
Listen up, gentlemen!
They will believe me if they want... judge it for you same!
Please... to the point! facts, dates! A date.
- Began... just over a year not long ago.
I feel that when I talk back to 20 years.
I had ideas, even too many!
It was painting the walls in my head!
It wanted to give life to the still lifes,
... capture the scent...
... of flowers, and vitamins food!
Of course, the dealers refuse politely...
... from their windows.
Then, ate and offered flowers to the models.
I had my ideas tended on the bed and we had...
... golden dreams.
I had specialized in studies of dogs... having the same issue as me.
Had gained some notoriety in Montparnasse.
Looked after my appearance, changed every day...
... shirt dirty, had hired an assistant... staff.
People see me in the middle of the street... but not because...
... my talent, but my clothes.
But I´m flattered.
One day, I entered a shop gloves.
There were many vendors.
- What are you, sir?
- I would... No.
What does, sir?
- I chose with this certainty that we are called "a chance".
Miss!
- What are you, sir?
- Gloves, white gloves.
But in a clear white, slightly green. With reflections:
What are some color!
- Why do I want?
- For a wedding.
- In that case, we have a...
... lot of good gloves to...
Sorry, just a minute!
- What is it? A great wedding at the Madeleine!
With Swiss guards, red carpet, candles... lots of lights!
After... it, the veil, almost floating and hands...
... full of flowers. And finally, the geometric line of courtship...
... and the family, all in a couple glove! Includes!
What would you do for me?
- In principle, I´m not married.
- Do you not believe in marriage?
- For me not.
Can I ask your hand?
- What?
- It is back!
- - Nice! Am I the person thousand number who said so?
- No, the first one.
- Thanks!!
I´m here since yesterday.
I'm glad I came today!
- I want to know your size, not its future!
- But I'm not the one who gets married!
- Seemed so convincing!
Is the godfather?
- No, I´m a painter.
I paint a wedding!
- With white gloves?
No, I will paint them!
- Yes!
- Let's see!
Not your size.
- I want to symbolize through a still life of what is alive...
... at the ceremony!
Every finger will animated
... as a character and be directly to the public eye.
Did you know?
- It's a great painter!
- You talk about me in Montparnasse.
- Also portraits?
Gladly make yours.
I started...
... his portrait... and to court.
But neither one thing nor the other progressed. Irene was... disappointing. And I was there, motionless, wondering at the same time...
... what were the colors for paint and gestures...
... or words to seduce.
This year will go to Saint Irene.
Finally!
- Too late?
One hour.
You just happened?
- No... Someone.
- Calm down, we are not saying more that unpleasant things.
Flowers,
But what happens?
- It's Saint Irene!
- Once again, it's lovely!
Why?
- It's a surprise.
What?
Gloves!
- Suede!
I will guard them!
- I had thought that...
- We have sold a lot old!
You can return them.
- It was symbolic.
- Yes, the Madeleine, the Swiss, loves, delights and organum!
- Everybody knows it!
- I speak very high?
Boss!
Boss! Come here, please!
Yes, sir?
What happens?
- It's inconceivable!
A rotten soup, stinking steak!
- Sulfur!
- A scorched sauce...
... and a garrison false!
- A curse, sir!
- Is that your excuse?
What do you think, sir?
- Sorry!
- Take it out!
Excuse me!
- Don´t want to marry me?
- Don´t ask me why.
- It would be my wife, my companion, my inspiration...
- You have many ideas!
- That no!
My dog has given me a extraordinary:
Paint life as seen by dogs.
An amazing view!
Later, I will paint the men seen by a horse, a swallow, an owl... a worm...
- The worms do not buy.
- I got money!
- Sure!
- Unique and valid, the glory!
- I asked...
... who thought of you, and do not know.
- Jealous.
- Do you? My poor friend!
- Could believe it.
- Who you calling...
... "always on the verge"?
- Envy.
- Roland, return home and have a look:
It would be a sensation, a gallery of mediocrity
... you would be the best!
- Oh, it's hard... You're right,
I have opened your eyes!
Until now it had scruples, but now I understand:
Tomorrow I will paint for you.
In three months, to the Salon!
A beautiful style.
- "¡The Salon...
"... Sleep in the room!
Too late. A month ago
"A painter, why not?
"He has talent, I´m ambition!"
How wrong!
- A few weeks!
Not always I will be a saleswoman!
- What do you want?
- If the lady and gentleman...
...they wanted to ask, one is late.
I have kid.
- In the form of a glove?
- No, fillet!
With purée.
The specialty of the day!
- A bad day!
- But the kid is good.
Do not have deer?
Well, I'm already served of venison!
Come on, say what they want!
You tell me!
- Also in life, let the others ask their menu:
Do not invite anyone to dinner! No gloves are available for him here.
- Who is he?
- Anyone!
Not offered nothing!
- Do not marry you!
- He was a man who knew what wanted! Also I!
- What?
- Living away from you!
Let go! Always will be a little painter...
... in a tiny workshop, always eat at small tables
... slept with small women in small beds...
... and ultimately his life in a small box! Bye,
... small!
- Free me of this!
Give me an order!
An order for 12! with soda!
This is an elegant home!
Prove this! Moderate the heart and refresh the ideas!
Can I sit?
- Whatever.
- Santa Madonna, Drink as if it was a water!
Cheers!
I don´t like to see my clients sad!
- Sad, not.
- The whole world it is,
... except me... I am very happy... too happy.
Well it seems not!
- Me? But this is happiness!
- What?
- The hapiness!
Have, you seem to be nice.
We sell.
- Very nice!
Cigarette?
- Thanks. I do...
... myself.
Wow!
With the left! I never knew rolling a cigarette.
- It is the talisman who does.
- A talisman rolling...
... cigarettes?
- Yes, sir.
A special talisman!
I had acquired skill, fortune, talent... women.
Everything! We sell.
His talisman that gives you everything and still want to sell?
I need to sell.
Why?
Because... if not sold before death,
I'll be damned.
Eternally doomed!
- Come, come!
- And all day after being in cookers,
... I have the taste of Hell!
- No joke!
If you were so good, nothing prevent sale!
Do you sell expensive?
- Of course not! ¡Few cents!
- Well, it is not expensive.
- Shop by cents, I can not...
... sell more than one because you can not sell...
... more than losing.
- It's fun!
- Look at him! We appeal to an artist like you!
- How do you know?
- The talisman, sir!
Come!
Come!
I'll show you the way.
- Do not buy it, sir!
Do not buy!
- Shut up!
Come, sir!
- Do not buy!
Do not buy!
- Who is this guy?
- A poor fool!
He believes the Guardian Angel of the world! Spend!
Over here! Excuse the mess!
Here it is!
- That is the talisman?
- His box, his coffin.
It´s inside.
Do not be afraid.

Enough!

Tell me, Irene...
Being convicted... mean anything to you?

What say?
Nothing.
Have you finished?
How have you signed?
"Maximus Leo?
Why Maximus Leo?
- Do not know!
Signed well, without thinking.
Curious nickname!
- Skin is not yet dry.
- Let me.
I think you're becoming very mischievous!
You can sleep peacefully.
You will...
... to pay for this!
"The clear moon the shadow and the knife."
It is not my hand.
Irene!
My box!
- Please excuse! Was distracted.
Sorry.
Take.
Take one of my brochures.
A council is good, and two better than one! All right!
Every man is in his hand.
The man is in those of God.
This is the hand of Alexander,
Hannibal, Napoleon.
If you take it! The hand of
Pasteur, that the murderer...

And never left me.
Whatever happens.

... A year later,

... the first exhibition of young painter Maximus Leo.
It was a beautiful presentation.
Had great personalities.

Poets Fatigued Institute,
... women of the world...Everything
Paris worldly... and idle.
And also many people who had come to the buffet.
- The hieroglyphics of poetry...

- It's the most beautiful gift to me could at my party!
Will there be others?
- Mystery!

- Nothing in my hands,
... nothing in their pockets!
Tonight, both at home
... windows and curtains closed...
- To your health, Madame!
- Thanks!
- Thanks, Gibelin!
Ah, it is improvised, to the health of Irene: his father was not king, it was of Suresnes, the mother of Charleroi.
But his soul is my queen and her body is my king.
It is not pretentious, but it is nice!
Do not seem to understand! Yes?
- Look, man! Go to that man there!
When this kind of provincial notary interest...
... for the painting which means nothing,
... it's glory.
Now you know!
Let me a moment!
- Bravo, darling!
- Congratulations!
- Sorry!
- The cocktail in Cocteau!
- What is this?
- An order, sir.
- Who has done?
- A small black gentleman.
"Deliver the
Church of St. Irene. "
Curious, was just...
- Yes, I know.
Want something sir?
- No, goodbye!
- At your service!
- I don´t know where it went. Not at home?
There it is!
I called you.
You've searched everywhere very worried! Where were you?
- I don´t know.
- How? Gibelin is furious.
- I went. Do not stand the people you do not know...
... that the painting is speaking!
- Now that you succeed...
- Oh, success!
- For what you've struggled.
- Irene!
- Yes?
- We must leave.
- Go?
- Yes
To be leaving. Go,
I don´t know,...
Go anywhere!
- To anywhere?
- Do you love me, are you happy?
- Hug me!
Yes.
- Could you abandon all this,
... to Paris, the luxury?
- Have you done something wrong?
- No.
- Are we poor now?
- No, we are rich, but to leave.
- Where you want!
- Thanks. Go tonight.
- Tonight? But, my surprise, the party promised?
It will be later. Get ready!
If I change, will not.
- Be brave.
- Why?
- What?
- One man is waiting...
... in the office.
- It's crazy!
Maybe!
I apologize.
Wanted to know both.
- Me too!
Enjoy your party!
- What do you want? Why me spied upon, guarded?
- Debtor's curious language to lender
- I owe you something?
- Nothing... Your soul!
I have also come to know,
... as a farmer looks at his harvest.
So you are...
- Not always the devil is with a poor man!
It's impossible!
- But anything is possible. Today a year ago that you...
... bought the hand. Then
I guess...
... that his soul will be mine again after his death.
Who is richer for its debts, and who says no word, consent.
- But it is not possible!
To begin:
Do not sell what is not know! you can not sell what does not exist!
- Are you a lawyer?
- Men have always...
... sought to deceive!
Few cents:
You will not find anything better.
- Cents.
- Not worth anything.
Enjoy've found a tiny silver lining for this part...
... of himself in which not believe.
Just now, no.
It's a moment, he did not believe in you!
And it´s here!
- Even a little closer!
- Well...
Life is short.
And the condemnation is eternal.
More worth having to search!
Happiness on earth is important.
- But eternity!
- I get in trouble.
Want to buy again his soul?
- What pricing?
- No, I´m a good devil!
- How much?
- A few cents.
- That's right!
- Beware!
I returned the hand and forfeit valuable benefits.
He is a man of fortune,
... lover of a woman, but tomorrow... again be a failure.
Obviously, I need to think about.
Well, take your time, thinks about this.
I'm just a philanthropist.
We will...
... a flea market, today few cents, and twice tomorrow... continue... 8 cents, 16,
... 1024, in effect, to infinity.
You know what that is...
... infinity? I do,
I've been there. It is very nice.
That's right!
- Is the hand inside?
- Do?
Create teasing me!
Yeah, okay.
- So...
I ask.
- No, not yet.
Your soul is worth a mediocre life and broken?
Sorry!
I thought you were finished!
- introduce me, please.
- An old family friend,
... My wife!
- It's lovely!
My most sincere greetings!
- You have seen a year ago.
- I beg you!
- What?
Let me calm!
Want to return your chest?
Calm down, lady,
... now I'm going, let here with your happiness!
But, let me make this contribution to his party.
- It's not for me, is impossible!
Oh, a black diamond!
I beg you.
And that package?
You do not know a package?
- For the love of God, let me free!
What?
No!
Whatever.
Poor!
I refused.
- Goodbye, sir, and thank again! Roland, do not you stay...
... like a soul in pain!
Thank you very much!
- It's nothing, ma'am, all stays here, see you soon!
Look!
Give it! Take the fright.
- You're crazy!
- I do not want.
Are you jealous?
Irene!
Say you believe in me, love me!
What would you ask?
- Want to kiss you?
- Do not continue like this.
Listen to me!
My hand...
The hand you caressed, painting... was not my hand, I was not, was a gift, a talisman.
It is the hand of the box.
- It is not possible, you drunk!
- Champagne.
- Fantastic Birthday!
- So what is returned?
- Yes!
You're right.
She is a lovely woman!
A beautiful sinner!
If I give in exchange for...
... and leave him forever.
Would you like me to break the head?
Do not forget, will be doubled!
- For how many days?
- 3 weeks, Doctor.
He began the night of my birthday.
I´m so worried.
- What events?
- Fixed Ideas. Money.
Throughout the day is doing accounts.
Erase the days with crosses.
- Deadlines!
- Do not think so! Closes locked in your room: for 3 weeks, makes life separately. And talk alone.
They bend!
- Yesterday he accused me of be because of bad luck.
He wanted to strangle her.
- Strangle?
- Yes, doctor. Then apologized, but I am so afraid...
... do that again...
- Let's see!
- You're so excited!
- Calm down!
- No! No pass!
Let me calm!
What do you want?
- Good evening, Mr. Brissot!
His wife worries about his health...
- We have come for me!
She thinks I'm crazy.
Not my body or my brain what is in danger, but my soul,
... Do you understand?
And I'm not crazy!
Did you sense my presence?
I expected.
So... Have you thought?
Yes!
- Has made a decision?
- Yes!
You can take your talisman!
- Do you need?
And his paintings?
Does the glory?
- I know...
... to all the dealers;
Now that I have name...
- And is not afraid to lose their woman?
- My wife... Unfortunately,
I lost every day.
I am afraid. Selling your soul without keep your body?
Who's there?
- Are you coming to dinner?
- No. I am not hungry.
I...
... do you need?
- No!
- As you want...
So you have money?
Yes, I got it.
- Is the twenty-third day today,
Really?
Let's count.
How long?
And 20 cents.
- I'll do a check.
- No.
Today is Saturday. At this time the
Banks are closed.
- I had planned, I cash.
Someone has opened the safe!
Missing 20,000 francs!
It is not possible!
Irene!
Where is the money?
- What money?
- Lack 20.000 F.
- I picked up.

How do you know?
It is my job.
The girl!
Sorry!

It's impossible!
And now!

40 seconds. </ i>
- Time seems short in my company! But, beware,

I should, but they are 419,430.40!
See you tomorrow!
Do not forget!
They bend!
¡400.000F., 400.000F.!
I repeated it in the street.
Looking in the phone book, calling...
... friends who never were.
Without friends,...
- The sir is not!
- No, sir!
800.000F! 800.000F! 800.000F!
The amount grows forever, relentlessly, mathematically!
Maddened by the quantity,
... try their luck in the
Lottery, no luck.
Only lack Melisse, the chef
I had sold the talisman.
All doors closed eyes... also closed!
One day, let me lead of despair... When...
Hello!
Who?
Irene?
- Yes, I am Sure you needed money,
... you're looking everywhere,
I got it for you. Yes, very much!
Do not ask me how! Hello?
There's someone on the line!
¡Withdraw, sir! Say,
Can you hear me? A lot of money.
I returned to my old room at the hotel...
... Poirier, room mumber 23.
You hear me?
- Yes, ma'am, strangled!
You can count on the fingers.
He was so young!
- Have you been arrested?
What a thought!
- The room is upside down!
- Do not go, sir!
The police are in the house.
- Cannes, Nice,
Monte Carlo:
"Winter Passing in the French Riviera. "
Huh?
- It's in the newspaper.
- It's advertising!
No, it's a advice.
Good advice should be followed.
Go to Monte Carlo, stay in the
Nice in the hotel...
... Palmier, ask for
Mr. Verdure, the boss, of me.
It has a tip for roulette!
They teach you!
It's your last chance!
Who are you?
- Can not remember the dishwasher from Melissa´s...
... a little over a year?
My name is Angel.
Do you remember?
Ángel!
- I also lost the trick and when
I arrived...
... to Monte Carlo, was
6,510,886.40F!
Do game!
We are at game!
"Rien ne va plus"!
Black, 17 odd and lack!
Earned!
¡The chips, quantities...
... are crowded in front!
The people approached my table,
... believe that...
... brought luck! I would awaken from this nightmare!
When a woman at my table...
- What makes a sudden cold!
We are at stake!
"Rien ne va plus"!
Was not anything else, indeed.
Now the game was done!
And I lost every penny... no mercy of these... gardeners in smoking!
I left the salon...
... as a spectrum. A dealer believed it was..
... to kill myself.
Calm as I have no mood to kill myself!
Are you a dealer?
- Yes, we have been given...
... you need to return home. Where are staying?
- ... In Nice,
Palmier hotel.
- An elegant residence!
- Do you believe, in full carnival?
But do not...
... in time for the games and laughter? Go to Nice.
Find...
... To a nice person who will not be too reasonable.
- I do not dare!
- Losing money is not...
... fatal. Believe me!
- What can I do?
We men are united!
United in a chain mysterious:
A link!
A chain!
It's strange to say that word!
I too am part of a chain, limited to some men.
But... if they were happy, would benefit from advantages...
... beyond the human, and I, finally link, would have to pay.
Is it fair, God damn?
- Do not blaspheme!
Get back to your site from the masks!
- Has won sir?
- No.
- Have you lost much?
- Everything.
Your key. Paid in advance...
... a week.
Sir!
Do not make any silly?
That is not tolerated here.
- Don´t worry, even
I have the right to die.
- Go to the hall, some costumes very amazing!
- Hey, Roland Brissot!
We complete the knights...
... and I, all old possessor of a talisman.
- We, links of chain.
- Joined as the fingers of a hand.
- We have been invoked, we responded.
A coup? I'm ready!
- Your servers, me and my invincible sword!
It was a musketeer of the King.
It was the eve of a duel in which I exceeded cowardice
... That I bought in the house of an apprentice...
... of alchimist that damn talisman. From there I went...
... invincible, hand worked for me, had no rival...
... I win!
To date, unfortunately,
In that I left myself to provoke and killed my best friend.
Then I rid the hand through a beggar... that roam the Pont-Neuf.
This was the beggar.
Thanks to the hand, I became the biggest thief and liar...
... of my time. Collect an immense fortune, but not...
What I liked was possess, steal,
... minted coin.
My reputation of...
... thief was increasing, until
His Majesty trusts me your finances.
Until the day that the people was tired and I paid with my life...
But I had time of shaking hands to...
... a juggler.
- And I became the biggest...
... juggling...
... of my time. I always had liked the balance.
Surrounded by a mysterious power, quickly became the biggest... juggling... And the kings were fighting for meeting.
One day,
... in the Spanish court, asking me you play with eggs.
Suddenly, I do not know that momentum is crazy gripped me.
I hung up after climb to the throne.
But before, I had time to deliver the hand......
It was me who bought it.
And I became the largest magician of my time.
Called the Spectrum, did speak to the tables,
... sleeping a public stunned.
One day, I slept the daughter of a prince, but could not wake her.
The prince made me cut my head.
But before the execution, a surgeon wanted to buy...
... the body.
I sold him my hand.
I was this surgeon.
The poor bodies that had suffered a lifetime...
... till death were mine...
... an admirable field of experiences. Thanks to me,
...the surgery progressed towards new operations.
Unfortunately, one day, I succumbed before the longing and desire for...
... the woman he loved.
So I killed myself.
I sold the hand by a few cents to my young lab assistant.
I was that young assistant.
Were the principles of boxing.
In the Fair of the Throne, was surprised...
... the curious. My manager,
... that was not a philanthropist, he taught me with force and a good...
... advertising, it could win big money. I teach...
... the rudiments of boxing, to breathe, the set of legs...
... that would ensure victory.
So come to fight, the major battles in the light...
... of the reflectors with screams of madness, glory.
World Champion!
But not for long, alas!
I became blind, in a battle, knock...
... the referee.
That was misery. But, I needed live. For a long time...
... I sold vegetables in a small van. He sold...
... the hand of a cook.
Santa Madonna!
Mélisse!
Soon, hand saved me.
In a contest of great cooks,
I won...
... the gold medal that shone as a casserole, and my business...
... was famous. But the fear of the condemnation was tormenting me.
Fortunately, a night, an poor guy, a painter...
... who suffered for love.
I´m this poor guy...
... and strive to buy my soul.
Tonight I have over 6 million.
And it is almost midnight.
- We are here to help as what can each:
We will not find rest...
- While you continue this hand...
... condemning!
- But each day is doubled!
- We must win redemption of his soul.
- A musketeer?
- A magician?
- A juggler?
- Even a world champion?
- A cook?
- I'm here!
Greetings, the beggar´s era!
Armed robbery, scam, robbed, blackmail, crime...
... black market!
Let me!
Print the money.
- Come on,
I'll teach my office?
Would I be content with such a trifle?
Me, Evil?
Create in me, Roland Brissot, resigns! Her time has come.
- Hey, Mr. Devil, not so fast!
My alchemist!
- I can not hide anything!
To the owner of the hand!
- But, I...
- Where there is the one that has taken
... advantage?
- I know who he is.
Signed my pictures as "Maximus Leo".
How?
Maximus Leo!
- Glory to the Almighty and
Peace on Earth!
I was born the year of grace 1422, son of a woodcutter in the Alps,
Maxime... the Lion.
The monks
Saint-Bruno picked me...
... and I was very young
Abbey in the Allevard, in the...
... Dauphiné, named
Maximus Leo. God gave to...
... my left hand on a power.
- He could make you...
... the best man of your time!
But I left on the mountain.
And it ascended!
- Throughout my life, a little man in black around me... to tempt me and to buy my power.
But this hand is...
... together with the other united in prayer.
Then he returned to me in the silence of the tomb.
I cut the hands and a steal!
- Devil! And to me
I sold it!
Thief!
- Ungrateful, you do not serve for...
Thief!
- Ungrateful, you do not serve for...
... to please shy, beggars and unsatisfied?
- With the price of your soul!
- No. What everyone...
... has treated with him he was lacking value! He has not...
... sold anything, the devil himself could not sell anything...
... that does not belong!
And that He knows!
- Thief!
- Thief!
I'm saved!
I´m saved.
- Your soul is saved.
- So, sorry and takes your hand.
- No. Let her follow destination up to me!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
Rest in peace!
- Roland Brissot, you're the only one alive in our circle of shade.
We are but appearances.
My soul excuses you, but my body remains a disabled person.
His hand on his return tomb in the Dauphiné.
The last link in the chain has your turn, will be free!
- I was only in the morning.
On the table, seven empty plates,
... mouth vessels were up, moved the chairs...
... as if many people had passed this way.
And instead of my left hand was only a stump,
... a pain stabbing in the arm.
On the ground, where he had seen the monk, picked up the hand...
... fossil and dissected, that had been theirs.
I put it solemnly in the shelter.
Then I looked at the mountains the tomb of the monk...
... Maximus Leo returns to his mortal bed...
... and grant eternal rest.
- And here is the chest that you have stolen just now!
- And around us, a world invisible!
- Finally, is the same,
We do not make believe,
... in the twentieth century...
Denis, What do you think?
- In the mountains we do not see the things so simple!
- And you, colonel?
- It's suspicious and is not very clear,
... your story!
Because his soul has escaped...
... of that threat, should be relaxed.
- Gentlemen, I´m the only living being has dealt with the little man!
And he does not forgive those who have offended!
My soul is free, but not my life!
It´s not my body! Prosecute me!
It will kill me since as killed Irene!
Remember what we said the man's coffin,
... he is. It's there!
- Let's go!
- Do not open, do not open!
- It's the wind, the branches...
...of the fir!
- Do not go!
- Auguste!
- There´s so much hell like fire in my hands!
There´s something in the door.
The imprint of a hand!
How could he do that?
- That's right! There! That's right!
He flees.
You've seen something!
- I felt a warm in my legs!
- It was the devil himself!
- Come on?
Do not have a clear conscience!
There it is!
Run!
- Who are you?
- With a little man.
Fight!
- What?
- God!
- Come on!
- Come!
- I stay here,
I do not see it!
Is he dead?
Dead.
Skull fracture!
- Poor guy!
- Did you know?
He's dead, the unlucky!
Here's the box!
Is empty.
- Look!
It is a tomb.
Bring your lantern, Denis!
"Maximus...
"Leo."
- It's the tomb of the monk!
The circle is closed.
The last link in the chain is now the first.
Not so fast!
You're driving too fast!
What are you driving so fast for?
You were up to 35.
You know I don't like to go over 30!
You're always doing something else and having your mind on something else.
- I'm sorry, Mother.
- You haven't heard a word I said.
- Yes, I have.
- What did I say?
You said I was up to 35, and you didn't like me to go over 30.
Not that. I said we're going to have it in a church.
- Have what, Mother?
- The wedding!
- Oh.
- See? You weren't listening.
Red light, Walter.
That reminds me.
Bring me home some soap chips.
I like the Sea Drift brand.
They don't make you sneeze.
Go ahead, Walter.
Now don't forget the name: Sea Drift.
Somewhere off the South China coast, in the worst typhoon in 40 years... the little schooner, India Queen, plowed through an ocean gone mad.
Straining pumps went ta-pocketa, ta-pocketa.
Up on deck, Captain Walter Mitty stood at the helm... fighting courageously from keeping this tortured vessel... from being smashed to bits.
What are you doing here?
Get below!
Can't I help? You haven't had your clothes off in three days!
Somebody's gotta get the India Queen through.
There's half a million dollars of rare spices aboard this ship!
I promised your father
I'd get it through.
Captain Mitty, you're hurt!
It's nothing!
Just a broken arm!
Walter! Watch out!
I'm sorry.
Did you write down all the things
I told you to write down?
- I'll remember them.
- Oh, no, you won't.
You just make a note of it in your little black book.
Number two thread.
- Snapdragon seeds.
- Wait a minute.
Sock stretchers, can of Gleamo Floor Wax...
- Gleamo what?
- Gleamo Floor Wax.
Fly spray.
- What's that "SS"?
- Sock stretchers.
- Well, write it out.
- All right.
And cheese grater.
And don't forget to return this sprinkling can.
I tried it out this morning, and the holes are too small.
Tell them I have better things to do than wait for the water to come out.
Bye, darling.
Careful, sweet.
Don't forget the cake!
- What?
- The cake!
Back in the car, please.
Keep that thing in, bud!
"Pierce Publishing Company"
Excuse me.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Here are those drawings you wanted.
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
Oh, that's pretty, Mr. Grimsby.
Yeah, it's a bit mild.
I think I ought to tear the dress off her other shoulder.
You could use a little more blood on the ax.
Well, good morning, everybody.
You think I'd forgotten you?
Here we are.
Now stop, Elmer.
You've had enough already.
Come on. There.
Hey, dream boy.
- The old man's screaming for you.
- Oh! The conference.
Let's see. "Spicy Sea Stories."
Here we are.
"Air Aces."
Hold it!
Raise your hands just a little.
Still!
- Hello, Fred.
- How's it going, Walter?
Fine.
Gentlemen, it will be the regular practice of the firm till...
Well, Mitty.
So you finally chose to honor us with your presence.
- Yes, sir.
- Where are the proofs to "Air Aces"?
- Right here, Mr. Pierce. Ready to go.
- Put it to bed.
- Mitty!
- Yes, sir?
What is the meaning of this?
Meaning of what, Mr. Pierce?
You had the vampire killed off... of the first installment of "The Lady And The Vampire."
There are 33 issues to go.
- But he isn't really dead.
- What do you mean he isn't dead?
The villagers drove a stake through his heart!
Anybody knows that kills a vampire!
Yes, but if you read further on you'll find the stake only went through a lung.
You don't have to worry. He'll be back sucking blood in the next issue.
Well, sit down.
If you'd been here on time you'd know why I called this meeting.
To repeat, ladies and gentlemen:
Ours is a great and proud list of magazines.
"Racy Detective Stories,
"Astounding Adventure Tales"...
"Wild Confessions,
"Air Aces."
- "Frontier Stories"...
- "Exotic Love Stories."
- And "Sensational Murders."
- And "Sen..."
Mitty, when I need your help
I'll ask for it.
But a new and virgin field of fiction has come to my attention.
A rich and as yet untapped vein... embracing thousands of undiscovered readers.
Starting the first of next month we go to press with a new baby.
"Hospital Love Stories."
- Congratulations! You've done it again!
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Well, what do you think?
- Oh! I've always liked it, Mr. Pierce.
Don't you remember? I suggested the idea in a memorandum last month.
Oh, that!
I had this idea two years ago.
Now, the type of stories we need...
You may take notes, gentlemen.
Now, let me see.
"Hospital Love Stories."
What have we got to sell?
Beautiful blonde nurses.
We can't have too many nurses.
Capture the glamour of the hospital.
You get the idea?
With the compassionate look of a man who had seen much too much pain...
Dr. Walter Mitty, the surgical genius... entered the breathless hush of the operating room... the sound of the huge anesthetizing machine... going ta-pocketa, ta-pocketa.
There were whispered introductions.
I'm glad you came.
Dr. Remington. Dr. Renshaw.
Dr. Pritchard-Midford,
St. John's Hospital, London.
- Dr. Walter Mitty.
- Gentlemen.
The new anesthetizer's giving way.
There's no one in the East who knows how to fix it.
Quiet, man.
Give me your fountain pen.
- That will hold for ten minutes.
- Astounding!
He's not only the greatest surgeon in the world... he's also a mechanical genius.
You'd better get on with the operation.
Good heavens!
- What is it?
- Coreopsis has set in.
Poor devil!
Would you take over, Mitty?
If you wish.
It's hopeless.
There's only one chance, gentlemen.
The Vienna Trepan.
The operation Heinzelman performed on a rabbit?
Precisely.
Blood pressure, please.
Thirty over two hundred.
Scalpel.
Sock stretcher.
Sprinkling can.
Cheese grater.
Floor wax.
Needle and number two threads.
There you are.
Oh, Doctor, do you think...
- Will he...
- There, there, Miss Cartwright.
Your brother will play the violin again.
I just grafted new fingers on him.
Oh, you're wonderful!
Wonderful!
You'll want some rest now.
Wonderful.
Mitty! I asked you a question.
I expect an answer!
What's that?
I was just thinking, sir.
We might possibly put out a pocket-size edition.
- Pocket-size edition?
- Yes, sir.
- For pockets.
- You weren't thinking at all!
- You were daydreaming again!
- Oh, no, sir! I was really thinking.
I was thinking about hospitals for hospital stories.
I finished talking about hospitals ten minutes ago!
The subject, for your information, is the next issue of "Racy Detective."
Pocket-size edition.
Not a bad idea.
- Hello.
- Hello, Mother.
- You forgot to bring the cake.
- What cake?
Gertrude and her mother are coming to dinner.
I asked you to bring home a cake.
What's that thing?
I thought you said "rake."
You're getting more absent-minded every day.
It's all that daydreaming you do.
I brought everything else:
The number two thread... the Gleamo wax, the sock stretchers.
- Did you bring the snapdragon seeds?
- No. They didn't have any.
The man said petunias were just as pretty.
Don't you ever forget.
When I say snapdragon seeds...
I mean snapdragon seeds.
Yes, Mother.
Just leave everything in the hall.
I'll take care of it.
Hurry and get cleaned up.
They'll be here any minute.
All right, Mother.
- Is there any mail for me?
- No.
- Who are you expecting a letter from?
- Nobody.
I just thought there might be some mail.
Don't use the guest towels.
I just put them up.
Use the one on your door.
All right, Mother.
And put on that clean shirt
I hung up for you.
And use some of the cologne
Gertrude gave you for Christmas.
Do I have to?
It smells like ether.
Don't be silly.
It's lovely... and the least you can do for your fiancee.
Oh, all right.
Oh, gosh!
- Irmagarde!
- Eunice, how are you?
Come in, dear... and Gertrude.
My, what a sweet hat!
And, Gertrude, you look too cute for words.
I hope you don't mind my bringing
Queenie, Mrs. Mitty.
She doesn't like to be alone.
Do you, Queenie, in that great, big empty house?
Not at all, dear.
Walter, there's someone down here to see you, dear.
- Hello, Mrs. Griswold.
- Dear Walter.
- Hello, Gertrude.
- Come along, Irmagarde.
What's that awful smell?
It's that cologne you gave me for Christmas.
It's lovely, isn't it?
Queenie, say hello to your future daddy...
"Walty Mittens."
Don't stand there like a stick.
Wave back.
Hello, Queenie.
Naughty Queenie!
There you are, Queenie.
Mommy's precious.
- Have you talked to your boss yet?
- No, I haven't.
I certainly think you should talk to him and get two or three months off.
- Two or three months!
- Frankly I don't approve of honeymoons.
All that packing!
Walter's always head his heart set on seeing Yellowstone Park.
- Why?
- Why?
I don't know. I just thought
I'd like to see Yellowstone Park.
Do they let dogs in there?
Honey, you weren't thinking of taking Queenie along?
- I was only asking!
- I wouldn't dream of leaving Queenie!
Queenie and Walter don't trust each other. That's why they don't get along.
She always starts!
You see?
Queenie, you old crosspatch.
I don't think she's feeling well.
Why don't you try that new vitamin puppy biscuit?
Walter would be happy to pick some up for you.
That would be wonderful.
- Make a note of that, dear.
- Yes, Mother.
Walter, you haven't touched your nice milk toast.
- I'm not hungry.
- You know the doctor said... it would be good for your nervous stomach.
That's why the Air Corps turned him down.
It must be cold in here.
Queenie's shivering.
Yes, Mother. I know.
The furnace.
Excuse me.
Walter's a very lucky boy.
Tubby Wadsworth has proposed a half a dozen times.
He's still doing it!
The Spitfire dived through the clouds, its machine guns belching lead.
Oblivious to the ominous ta-pocketa, ta-pocketa of his failing engines...
Wing Commander Walter Mitty, the most feared man in R.A.F. Desert patrol... clung to the tail of the Messerschmitt.
Himmel's villain.
It's Walter Mitty.
I am a lost man.
Mitty's jaw was a grim, straight line... as he gave the Jerry three more lethal bursts... and watched him go down in flames.
As I go rolling home
I'm as happy as a king, believe me
I say, fellas!
There's Group Captain Mitty.
He made it!
Mitty, how many this time, old boy?
- Hello, sir.
- Good show, Mitty.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- That makes 73, doesn't it?
No, 71 actually.
2 were only probables, you know.
Oh. Spot of brandy?
Oh, yes. Thank you, sir.
I say, old chap.
You're wounded.
It's nothing, sir. Merely a scratch.
Set the bone myself.
Priceless fellow.
- I wish we had more like you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Anything troubling you, sir?
- Young Raleigh.
Got a case of nerves. I promise the general we'd get that tank dump.
Oh, bad luck, sir.
- Is it vital?
- Vital?
Our whole desert campaign depends upon it.
Oh, I see.
Put young Raleigh to bed, sir.
- What do you mean?
- I'll fly his mission.
You? You haven't closed your eyes in three days.
I know, sir, but we only live once.
Or do we?
- Shall we have a go at it?
- Cheerio.
- Mitty looks a bit done in, fellows.
- Yes, he does.
Got the courage of a lion, though.
Never gives up.
He's a delightful fellow.
I studied music with him at the Academy.
I shall never forget his impersonation of old Professor Gruenwald.
- Do you remember?
- Rather.
Almost drove the old professor barmy.
- I wish he'd do it now.
- So do I.
Go ahead, Mitty.
I'd rather enjoy a laugh myself.
All right, sir.
Say, let me have your coat, old boy.
There you are!
He's doing it now.
All right! Everybody scatter away to the chairs here!
Come on, everybody!
Everybody sit down.
Children, what makes music music?
Music! "Und" why?
When to the symphony you go and they're playing fast but slow
Do you hear the pizzicato's sweet hello when you go
Or the flugelhorns up high
Or the fiddles when they cry
No, und why
Because you don't go
You see, children.
A symphony is not only music.
It tells a story which has a beginning, middle und an end.
Except of course, the "Unfinished Symphony"... which has a beginning...
We will now take up the instruments.
There is the trombone
Und the tuba
Und the oboe
Und the saxophone, sousaphone zither and xylophone
Clarinet, bugle horn fiddle and flugelhorn
Tenor kazoo and the timpani too
They are all very busy, except the cymbal.
He stands in the corner and looks around in disgust.
This brings us to Symphony Number 45.
Which was written by the great Czechoslovakian composer...
Andre Griminick... the Second.
This work was composed under a slight disadvantage.
He had no talent.
The conductor lifts his baton, und we start.
This is just mood music.
Now comes the first movement:
Presto vivace argumento molto... cantabile molto chocolate molto.
Und we have the first theme which is naturally played on the first fiddle.
This represents a young girl which is living with her wicked guardian... who is a French horn.
Now this young girl... who is a beautiful girl... und her wicked guardian... live all alone on a farm.
And all she has for company are a hen... und a dog... und a nanny goat.
At this point in the symphony, along comes a handsome young trumpet.
Und when he clasps his eyes on this young girl... his heart goes...
This is Czechoslovakian for thumping.
Und he gets so excited that he has a solo passage.
Which brings us to the second movement where the fiddle is happy.
Und the trumpet is happy.
When suddenly, out stalks the French horn.
The little fiddle is so "putrefied," her bridge falls out.
Und the trumpet says...
But the French horn is very objectionable to this.
Und the trumpet blows his top.
Shut up!
Now I know who you are!
You are not a French horn at all!
That:
Had me fooled for a while.
But a:
Gave you away.
You are a German glockenspiel in disguise, beyond a doubt... wanted by the police for drowning
12 little fiddles out.
The glockenspiel tries to escape to his flat... but the animals are too sharp for him.
In the leg!
In the neck!
In the face!
In the other place!
The glockenspiel is trapped, his escape they are foiling.
So he jumps into a kettle drum which is boiling!
Hooray, the bad old glockenspiel is dead
Happy little fiddle and trumpet are wed
- Very good show.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- See you at headquarters.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, you are so brave.
So strong! So handsome!
You like Cosette, no?
Rather.
Cheerio.
Will you please come up here?
Your milk toast is getting soggy!
Right-o, Mother!
If you'd gotten up on time, you'd have made the 7:45.
There was no reason to oversleep!
I had to stay up and read those proofs for Mr. Pierce.
Take a cab from the station, never mind the expense.
I'll take it out of your allowance.
Good-bye, dear.
Hurry, now! Hurry, dear!
Bye! The rake!
And don't forget the birdseed and unbleached muslin!
- Good-bye, Mother
- Good-bye, darling.
- May I?
- Pardon me.
Manhattan transfer.
Good-bye, darling.
Have a nice day at the office.
I'll see you at Mother's tonight.
Taxi!
Hello.
I thought you got off at Manhattan transfer?
I just pretended to.
I was trying to avoid a masher.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry if I gave the wrong impression...
Oh, it wasn't you. But I appreciate your coming to my assistance.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well, good-bye.
Oh, darling! You shouldn't have done it!
Oh, it's the loveliest bracelet in the world!
Come! We'll go to the dressmakers together.
What's the matter?
You've a good face.
Well, you've a good one too.
Don't be alarmed.
I'm not going to kiss you again.
I wasn't thinking about that.
I think I can trust you, Mr...
Mitty. Walter Mitty.
- My name is Rosalind van Hoorn.
- How do you do?
Gee, that's a pretty name.
I need your assistance, Mr. Mitty.
Will you help me?
- Me? How?
- I'm on my way to meet the Hollandia.
I'm being followed, and I'm frightened.
Please come with me.
- You're frightened?
- Yes.
- And you want me to help you?
- Yes.
Gosh.
If you were along
I wouldn't have to worry.
Well, I guess I could handle myself in a pinch.
I do a little boxing at the Y.
- Well, I'd like to see any masher try...
- Oh, you're very kind!
Never mind the Pierce building.
Go to Pier 47.
Yes, never mind...
Oh! Wait a minute!
I'm sorry! I'm late for the office.
I have to be...
Driver, will you stop the ca...
There it is now.
Please! Stop the cab!
Bye.
Here's my share of the cab ride.
That isn't necessary.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Mr. Mitty.
- Oh!
- What's the matter?
My briefcase! I left it in that cab!
It had all the proofs to "Air Aces" in it! Mr. Pierce will kill me!
Here! Hold this, will you?
Taxi!
Pier 47, North River.
Karl Maasdam, Rotterdam.
Okay, Mr. Maasdam.
Excuse me, miss.
Did you see a girl in a green dress?
She came in a cab.
It had my briefcase in it.
I didn't see the driver's face, but the back of his head was kind of oblong.
- Uncle will be so glad to see you.
- Not more than I'll be glad to see him.
It's incredible.
I can't believe that he's still living.
You're quite sure you came here unobserved?
Karl, you mustn't trouble yourself anymore.
You're in safe hands now.
Miss van Hoorn.
Wait a minute!
My briefcase...
I left it in your taxicab.
I followed you all the way down here.
I'm sorry I put you to all that trouble.
- Mr. Maasdam, this is Mr. Mitty.
- How do you do?
- Is this what you are looking for?
- Yes. Thank you very much.
We're in a dreadful hurry. Would you help the driver with the luggage?
- I'm terribly late...
- We can drop you off.
Okay. Sure.
- What was that?
- What?
- That click?
- I didn't hear nothing.
Sorry to keep rushing you like this but our whole next issue is in here.
I'm in the publishing business.
We put out 31 magazines.
- He must be pretty tired.
- Yes, he's had quite a trip.
I guess he fell asleep.
- He's been stabbed!
- Stabbed?
What are we gonna do?
It's 10:00.
I've never been this late before!
What are we gonna do?
Driver, take us to the nearest police station!
Officer! Something terrible has happened!
- This young lady and l...
- What young lady?
Officer, I wanna report a murder!
- Murder?
- Yes, sir. We have the body outside.
What?
The body is in this taxicab.
What taxicab?
Well, it was right here.
I drove up with a girl in green, and we left the body in the taxicab.
- A yellow taxicab?
- No. A pink one.
- And the girl was in blue.
- No. Green.
Just as I thought!
This is a case for Scotland Yard!
No, no! Really, Officer.
Her name was Rosalind van Hoorn.
- And she said I had a nice face...
- Well, you have a nice face.
Now you go home and sleep it off.
Good morning, Mr. Mitty.
Good morning.
When do you take over the First National Bank?
- What do you mean?
- You seem to be keeping bankers' hours.
Well, I have a very good excuse.
I went down to meet the Hollandia to get my briefcase.
I was with a beautiful girl, and coming back, a man was murdered.
Murdered right next to me in a taxicab.
Then they all disappeared.
- Oh, they all disappeared?
- Yes, sir.
Why don't you tell the truth?
You fell asleep on the train!
No, sir!
Yes, sir?
I wanna tell you something for your own good.
- You've been here for ten years.
- Eleven.
- Eleven is it?
- Yes.
If you don't stop this woolgathering
I'll have to take drastic action!
Oh, honest, Mr. Pierce.
This wasn't a daydream.
- I'm sure it wasn't.
- I've no time for your excuses.
- Where are those proofs?
- Right here in my briefcase.
I have them all read and corrected, sir.
- There they are.
- What's this?
My memorandum book.
Okay, we'll send these to press.
Here. You get busy on "Sensational Murders."
"Sensational Murders"?
I don't want to be bothered. I have an important board meeting this afternoon.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh!
Tell Joe to doctor up that knifing story.
Lord Cecil was only stabbed once.
We've always given our readers their money's worth.
Have him stabbed front and back and in the side!
And save the heart for last!
Why should we stint on things like that?
What's the matter with you?
Nothing, sir.
Oh, Mr. Mitty.
It's you.
- I want to apologize for this morning.
- Where'd you disappear to?
I went to make a phone call and was advised to leave.
Uncle felt there was too much at stake for me to be mixed up in what happened.
Uncle who?
Uncle Peter. He told me to come here and get you.
- Get me?
- He wants to meet you.
I don't wanna get mixed up in this thing either.
Besides, I've got some shopping to do for my mother.
- Please come.
- I only have an hour for lunch.
And I'm supposed to be back at the office at 1:30.
It'll only take a few minutes.
I promise.
Please?
Say, what happened to that taxicab?
What happened to the body?
- They took it away.
- "They"? Who's they?
Uncle will explain everything.
- Hello, Tyler.
- How do you do?
- Tell my uncle Mr. Mitty is here.
- Yes, Miss van Hoorn.
We'll wait in the library.
He'll only be a moment.
Gee, that's pretty. The picture...
Do you mind if I look at it?
Of course not.
Do you like it?
- Oh, I love it.
- It's always frightened me.
Oh, I thought...
That's my favorite song..."Beautiful
Dreamer." I like the way you play it.
Mr. Van Hoorn is waiting in the solarium.
Thank you, Tyler.
- Hello, Uncle.
- Hello, my dear.
Uncle Peter, this is Mr. Mitty.
- How are you, Mr. Mitty?
- Fine, thank you.
You are the young man who was so kind to my niece this morning.
Oh, I really didn't do anything.
- You'll have a cup of tea with us.
- Tea?
- Yes, please do.
- All right.
Pardon me.
- Gee, these are beautiful.
- You like flowers?
Well, Mother likes them.
We're raising snapdragons now.
Only, I brought back petunias instead.
So I have to exchange them.
You know these bulbs came from Holland?
Oh, did they?
We get ours from Gerber's Feed Store.
Personally, I'd rather raise radishes.
They grow so fast, and you can eat them.
- You like yours with cream?
- No. Just salt.
No. No cream. Thank you.
I thought she meant the radishes.
- Please sit down.
- Yes.
- Here you are, Uncle.
- Thank you, my dear.
The cover fell down.
There we are.
I asked Rosalind to bring you here... because I wanted to tell you that your life is in danger.
Danger?
You were present when poor Maasdam was murdered this morning.
But that was a coincidence!
I was at the pier...
Just the same, Mr. Mitty.
You were there.
- And they might try to kill you too.
- Why?
Mr. Mitty, I can see that you are a man of great courage.
Would you like more tea?
Yes, thank you.
Since you have already become involved... it may be necessary for you to face even greater danger.
It may, huh?
Well...
- I think he should know all the facts.
- I think I should too.
Uncle Peter was curator of the
Royal Netherlands Museum in Rotterdam.
- He was?
- He left before the German invasion.
That seems like the most reasonable time.
But before I escaped...
I managed to see that all of our great art treasures... were concealed in hundreds of obscure places.
Then there's nothing to worry about.
Yes, there is.
The hiding place of each article was recorded in a little black book.
The Boot will do anything to get it.
The Boot?
- Who's the Boot?
- His real name is Wilhelm Krug.
That's why Maasdam was murdered this morning.
- I see.
- Krug thought that Maasdam had the book.
- Oh. Well then, who has it?
- Nobody knows.
But if the Boot thought you had it... he'd cut your throat in a second.
Let's notify the O.P.A.
I mean, the F.B.I.
Uncle has already notified them.
They're working together with the Dutch Secret Police.
I can understand your alarm.
But the police are very efficient.
The minute you are killed... they'll double their efforts.
Yes. Of course.
That's very reassuring.
But I am... I must be running along now.
I have so much shopping to do.
As a precaution, say nothing about this matter to anyone.
Even your loved ones.
Of course, you can trust me,
Mr. Van Hoorn.
- I won't say...
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- You're very brave.
Thank you.
Bye.
- May I help you, sir?
- Yes, ma'am.
I have some things here.
I'd like some "Dutch crown jewels.
The diamond collection..."
Jewelry department on the fifth floor.
"Diamond collection... House of Orange?"
"Vandermeer originals?"
Mister, this is the pet department.
Pet...
Oh, the black book!
- How do you do?
- Was there something else you wished?
Yes. I'll have some of these dog biscuits.
I always eat them.
They contain vitamin B-1.
- You forgot your change, sir.
- Oh, thank you very much.
These are lovely leashes, aren't they?
Oh, yes. Lovely.
Lovely leashes.
- How much are these muzzles?
- Three dollars.
Three dollars?
One, two... Thank you.
- Shall I have it wrapped, sir?
- No.
I'll wear it home.
In more controlled figures...
Oh... How do you do?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Notice, ladies, the exquisite line and the smooth contour.
The featherweight quality's achieved by using satin and bengaline... with a chiffon trimming.
Specifically designed for...
I think you'd be able to see better from the front.
No, thank you very much. I've got to make a phone call. Excuse me.
Clarissa, would you mind coming in here a minute?
Yes, Miss Blair.
These nightgowns go in the early delivery today.
And this corset goes to Mrs. Follinsbee.
Be sure that it makes the afternoon delivery tomorrow.
- I will.
- Thank you.
Just a minute!
What are you doing in here?
Excuse me.
- Is this the hardware department?
- You know this isn't!
Get out of here, you Peeping Tom!
Excuse me, ma'am.
This idea for pocket-size editions came to me about two years ago.
And I've given it considerable thought.
There are four values to pocket-size editions.
One: They fit into the pocket.
Two: I have behind me a well-geared organization... of sober, industrious employees who...
Get that thing out of here!
Elmer, shoo!
What in thunderation do you think you're doing?
I was trying to get away from somebody.
There's a man following me.
He had terrible eyes and a long knife.
I'll explain it all to you later.
Elmer. Go! Come on! Out!
Go away, Elmer.
That's it.
I'm sorry.
I know how busy you are.
So I don't like to disturb you...
Pardon... Excuse me.
Is Mr. Van Hoorn or his niece at home?
Do you know what time they'll be back? It's very important.
I see. Well, would you leave a message that Mr. Mitty called.
I know of a way to kill a man and leave no trace.
Excuse me. I'll be with you in just a moment.
Who are you?
Dr. Hugo Hollingshead.
I have a manuscript... that contains the most ingenious method for the perpetration of homicide.
I'm afraid you have the wrong office, Dr. Homicide.
- Mr. Pierce buys all the stories.
- Mr. Pierce told me to see you.
Oh? Well, would you have a chair?
Did you know that an icicle inserted into the brain... will melt slowly and leave no trace?
It's been done. Sorry.
Would you...
Perhaps you'd be interested in a different method?
The sensory nerve at the base of the skull is vulnerable to an assassin.
One merely presses with the thumbs, thus-
The resultant brain hemorrhage produces instantaneous death.
- Without a clue.
- That's very good, Doctor.
But we used the sensory nerve in "The Gland Specialist's Revenge."
Excuse me, won't you?
What you don't know... is that the base of the brain is a very sensitive place.
As you can see, the only weapon is the human hand.
Hey, wait a minute!
Put that book do...
Help!
- Give me that vest!
- Help!
Give me my vest!
Help!
In "Hospital Love Stories," as in all other of our publications... action will be the key note.
Action! Thrills! The unexpected.
Of course, the medical aspects would be respected.
And a competent...
A competent staff of research men...
Yes, Mr. McClure?
Any question?
No questions.
A competent staff of research men...
What in confounded tarnation are you and that pigeon trying to do?
Listen to me!
I was hanging by my hands!
A tall doctor pushed me out the window!
- What is this? What tall doctor?
- The one you sent to tell me the story!
He didn't come to tell my any story!
He came to push me out the window!
I didn't send anyone to throw you out of the window!
I've got more important things to do!
We are quite, quite wrong.
Once upon a time, there was a charming country house... in which lived a very happily married couple.
- Edith, you know the cocktail shaker?
- Yes'm.
Well, I want you to fill two of those long-stemmed glasses from it...
- and bring them up here.
- Yes'm.
And, Edith, as you're not in the navy, it's unnecessary to do everything at the double.
- Very good, ma'am.
- And, Edith, when you're serving dinner... try to remember to do it calmly and methodically.
- Yes'm.
- Now go and get the cocktails.
- Yes'm.
- Not at a run, Edith.
Yes'm.
What do you suppose induced Agnes to leave us and go and get married?
The reason was becoming increasingly obvious, dear.
Yes. We must keep Edith in the house more.
- Oh, dear!
- What's the matter?
I have an idea this evening's going to be awful.
Well, I think it'll be funny, but not awful.
Why did you ask the Bradmans, darling?
He's as skeptical as we are.
- He'll probably say the most dreadful things.
- Well, I warned him.
There had to be more than three of us, and we couldn't have the vicar and his wife... because, A, they're dreary, and, B, they wouldn't have approved at all.
- No, it had to be the Bradmans.
- You must promise not to catch my eye.
If I giggle - and I'm very likely to - it will ruin everything.
You mustn't. You must be dead serious, and if possible, a little intense.
We can't hurt the old girl's feelings, however funny she is.
That was her.
Oh, that's her, is it?
I've seen her in the village several times.
She certainly is a strange woman.
The vicar told me he saw her up on the knoll on Midsummer Eve... dressed in sort of Indian robes.
Apparently, she's been a professional in London for years.
It's funny, isn't it? I mean, to think of people doing it as a profession.
Hmm. I believe it's very lucrative.
What does Mr. Condomine hope to get out of her?
Material for his book.
He's writing a mystery story, you know.
- To The Unseen.
- I must say that's a wonderful title.
If this evening's a success, I shall start writing the first draft tomorrow.
Used Elvira to be a help to you - when you were thinking something out, I mean?
Poor Elvira.
If I died before you'd grown tired of me,
I wonder if you'd forget me so soon.
- What a horrible thing to say.
- No, I think it's interesting.
Well, to begin with,
I haven't forgotten Elvira.
I remember her very distinctly indeed.
I remember how fascinating she was and how maddening.
I remember her gay charm when she had achieved her own way over something... and her extreme acidity when she didn't.
I remember her physical attractiveness, which was tremendous... and her spiritual integrity, which was nil.
Was she more physically attractive than I am?
That's a very tiresome question, darling, and fully deserves the wrong answer.
- You really are very sweet.
- Thank you.
- And a little naive too.
- Why?
Because you imagine that I mind about Elvira being more physically attractive than I am.
I love you, my love.
I know you do, but not the wildest stretch of the imagination could describe it... as the first fine, careless rapture.
- Would you like it to be?
- Good heavens, no.
Wasn't that a shade too vehement?
We're neither of us adolescent, Charles.
We've neither of us led exactly prim lives, have we?
We've both been married before.
Careless rapture at this stage would be incongruous and embarrassing.
I hope I haven't been in any way a disappointment, dear.
Don't be so idiotic.
After all, your first husband was a great deal older than you.
I wouldn't like you to think that you've missed out all along the line.
There are moments, Charles, when you go too far.
Sorry, darling.
If I died, I wonder how long it would be before you married again.
You won't die.
You're not the dying sort.
- Neither was Elvira.
- Oh, yes, she was, now I come to think of it.
She had a certain ethereal, not-quite-of-this-world quality.
Nobody would call you even remotely ethereal.
Nonsense.
She was of the earth - earthy.
Yes. Well, she is now anyhow.
You know, that's the kind of observation that shocks people.
It's discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit.
Write that down.
You might forget it.
You underrate me.
Anyhow, it was a question of bad taste more than honesty.
I was devoted to Elvira.
We were married five years.
She died. I missed her very much.
That was seven years ago and I've now, with your help, my love... risen above the whole thing.
That's probably the Bradmans.
It might be Madame Arcati.
Shall I go, or shall we let Edith have her fling?
She's probably on one knee in a pre-sprinting position... waiting for Cook to open the kitchen door.
- Steady, Edith.
- Yes, sir.
Good evening.
We're not late, are we? I only got back from the hospital half an hour ago.
Of course not.
Madame Arcati isn't here yet.
No, we passed her coming up the hill on her bicycle.
I'm so glad you were able to come.
We've been looking forward to it.
I feel really quite excited.
I guarantee that Violet will be good.
I made her promise.
Fine. Come and have a drink.
Oh, thank you so much.
Do you believe in it, Mrs. Condomine?
Do you think there's anything really genuine about it at all?
I'm afraid not. But I do think it's interesting how easily...
- Thank you.
- People allow themselves to be deceived.
But she must believe it herself, mustn't she?
Or is the whole business a fake?
I suspect the worst.
A real professional charlatan.
That's what I'm hoping for anyhow.
The character that I'm planning for my book must be a complete impostor.
It's one of the most important factors of the whole story.
Do you think she tells fortunes?
I love having my fortune told.
Yes, I expect so.
Have you ever attended her,
Doctor? Professionally, I mean?
Oh, yes. She had influenza last January.
She's only been here just over a year, you know.
Here she is.
I say, she knows, doesn't she, about tonight?
You're not going to spring it on her?
No, of course not.
It was all arranged last week.
I told her how profoundly interested I was, and she blossomed like a rose.
I really feel quite nervous, as if I were going to make a speech.
- Go and meet her, darling.
- Mmm.
- Oh, good evening.
- Hmm?
I've leant my bike up against that little bush out there.
It'll be perfectly all right if no one touches it.
- How nice to see you, Madame Arcati.
- My dear Madame Arcati.
I'm afraid I'm rather late, but I had a sudden presentiment... that I was going to have a puncture, so I went back to fetch my pump.
And then, of course,
I didn't have a puncture at all.
Perhaps you will on the way home.
Oh, thank you.
- You know -
- Dr. Bradman, the man with the gentle hands.
I'm delighted to see you looking so well.
This is my wife.
- How do you do?
- We're old friends. We meet coming out of shops.
Would you like a cocktail?
If it's a dry martini, yes.
If it's a concoction, no.
Experience has taught me to be very wary of concoctions.
- It is a dry martini.
- How delicious.
We do so much appreciate your coming all this way, Madame Arcati.
Oh, nonsense. It was wonderful cycling through the woods this evening.
- I was deafened with birdsong.
- It's been lovely all day.
Ah, but the evening's the time.
Mark my words.
Thank you.
Cheers! Cheers!
Don't you find it tiring bicycling everywhere?
On the contrary, it stimulates me.
I was getting far too sedentary in London.
That horrid little flat with the dim lights.
They had to be dim, you know.
The clients expect it.
This is the best dry martini
I've had for years.
- Would you like another?
- Certainly.
I must say, I find bicycling very exhausting.
Steady rhythm - that's what does it.
Once you get the knack of it, you need never look back. On you get, and away you go.
But the hills, Madame Arcati.
Pushing up those awful hills.
Just knack again.
Down with your head, up with your heart, and you're over the top like a flash... and skimming down the other side like a dragonfly.
- Dinner is served, ma'am.
- Thank you, Edith.
Oh, no red meat, I hope.
There's meat, but I don't think it will be very red.
I make it a rule never to eat red meat before I work.
Would you rather have an egg or something?
Oh, no, thank you. We'll risk it.
It's just that it sometimes has an odd effect.
- What sort of effect?
- Nothing of the least importance.
Thank you.
How do you get in touch with people on the other side, Madame Arcati?
Through a control, of course.
In my case, a little girl.
They're generally the best.
Some mediums prefer Indians, of course, but personally I've always found them unreliable.
In what way unreliable?
Well, to start with, they're frightfully lazy.
Also, when faced with any sort of difficulty... they're apt to go off into their own tribal language, which is naturally unintelligible.
That generally spoils everything and wastes a good deal of time.
Do you feel funny when you go off into a trance?
In what way "funny"?
I don't think Mrs. Bradman means funny in its comic implication.
I think she meant strange or odd.
The word was an unfortunate choice.
Oh, I'm sure I'm very sorry.
It doesn't matter in the least.
Please don't apologize.
When did you first discover that you had these remarkable powers?
When I was quite tiny.
My mother was a medium before me, you see... and so I had every opportunity of starting on the ground floor, as you might say.
I had my first trance when I was four years old... and my first ectoplasmic manifestation when I was five and a half.
Oh! What an exciting day that was.
I shall never forget it.
Of course, the manifestation was quite small and of very short duration... but for a child of my tender years, it was most gratifying.
- Can you tell fortunes?
- Certainly not.
I disapprove of fortune tellers most strongly.
Edith, we don't want to be disturbed for the next hour or so for any reason whatsoever.
- Is that clear?
- Yes'm.
Unless it's an urgent call for George.
- Unless it's an urgent call for Dr. Bradman.
- Yes'm.
Well, Madame Arcati, the time is drawing near.
- Who knows? It may be receding.
- How very true.
I hope you feel in the mood, Madame Arcati.
Well, it isn't a question of mood.
It's a question of concentration.
You must forgive us being so impatient.
We can easily wait if you're not quite ready to start.
No, nonsense, my dear.
I'm absolutely ready.
Heigh-ho! Heigh-ho!
To work we go.
- Is there anything you'd like us to do?
- Do?
Well, sort of hold hands or anything.
All that will come later.
First, a few deep, deep breaths of fresh air.
You may talk, if you wish.
It won't disturb me in the least.
Shh! It was an excellent dinner, darling.
- I congratulate you.
- The mousse wasn't quite right.
It looked a bit hysterical, but it tasted delicious.
- That cuckoo's very angry.
- I beg your pardon.
I said that cuckoo is very angry.
Listen!
- How do you know?
- Timbre.
No moon. That's as well, I think.
A mist rising from the marshes.
There's no need for me to light my bicycle lamp, is there?
- I mean, no one's likely to fall over it.
- No. We're not expecting anyone else.
Splendid.
Good night, you foolish bird.
- You have a table?
- Well, we rather thought that one might do.
I think the one there would be better.
Over here, Mr. Condomine, please.
Hmm.
This is a moment that I always hate.
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.
- When I was a girl, I always used to be sick.
- How fortunate that you grew out of it.
Children are always much more prone to be sick than grown-ups though, aren't they?
Little Tommy Tucker sings for his supper.
What shall he have but brown bread and butter?
I despise that because it doesn't rhyme at all, but Daphne loves it.
Who's Daphne?
Daphne is Madame Arcati's control.
She's the little girl.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course. I see.
How old is she?
- Rising seven when she died.
- And when was that?
February the sixth, 1884.
She must be a bit long in the tooth by now, I should think.
You should think, Dr. Bradman, but I fear you don't, at least not profoundly enough.
Please forgive me, Madame Arcati.
I assure you I'm deeply interested.
It's of no consequence.
Now, will you all sit round the table, please, and place your hands downwards on it?
- Come, Mrs. Bradman.
- What about the lights?
All in good time, Mr. Condomine.
Now sit down, please.
That's better.
I presume that's the gramophone.
Would you like me to start it for you?
It's an electric one.
No, no. Please stay where you are.
I can manage.
Now, what have we here?
Brahms. Oh, dear me, no.
Rachmaninoff - too florid.
- Where's the dance music?
- They're the loose ones on the left.
I'm afraid none of them are very new.
Daphne's really more attached to Irving Berlin than to anyone else.
She likes a tune she can hum.
Oh, here's one - "Always."
- "Always"?
- What's the matter?
Uh - Nothing, darling. Nothing at all.
Now, there are one or two things that I would like to explain, so will you all listen attentively?
Of course.
Presently, when the music begins,
I'm going to switch out the lights.
I may then either walk about the room for a little or lie down flat.
In due course, I shall draw up that dear little stool and join you at the table.
I shall place myself between you and your wife, Dr. Bradman... and rest my hands lightly upon yours.
I must ask you not to address me or move or do anything in the least distracting.
- Is that quite, quite clear?
- Perfectly.
Of course, I can't guarantee that anything will happen at all.
Daphne may be unavailable.
She had a head cold recently and was rather under the weather, poor child.
On the other hand, a great many things might occur.
One of you might have an emanation, for instance.
Or we might contact a poltergeist, which would be extremely destructive and noisy.
- In what way destructive?
- They throw things, you know.
No, I didn't know.
Now, are you ready to empty your minds?
Do you mean you want us to try and think of nothing?
Absolutely nothing, Dr. Bradman.
Concentrate on a space or on a nondescript color.
- That's really the better way.
- I'll do my level best.
Good work!
Lights!
Oh, dear!
Is there anyone there?
Is there anyone there?
One rap for yes. Two raps for no.
Is there anyone there?
Oh!
Is that you, Daphne?
Is your cold better, dear?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Are you doing anything for it?
I'm afraid she's very fretful.
Is there anyone there who wishes to speak to anyone here?
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.
Oh, no, Daphne. Don't do that, dear.
You're hurting me.
Daphne dear, please!
Oh, be good. There's a dear child.
I'm sorry.
You say there's someone there who wishes to speak to someone here?
Is it me?
Is it Dr. Bradman?
Is it Mrs. Bradman?
Is it Mrs. Condomine?
Oh, stop it, Daphne. Behave yourself.
Is it Mr. Condomine?
There's someone who wishes to speak to you, Mr. Condomine.
Tell them to leave a message.
I really must ask you not to be flippant,
Mr. Condomine.
Charles, how can you be so idiotic?
You'll spoil everything.
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.
Do you know anyone who's passed over recently?
Not recently, except my cousin in the civil service... and he wouldn't be likely to want to communicate with me.
We haven't spoken for years.
Are you Mr. Condomine's cousin in the civil service?
No, I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.
Try and think of someone else.
Rack your brains.
It might be old Mrs. Plummett, you know.
She died on Whit Monday.
I can't imagine why old Mrs. Plummett should wish to speak to me.
- We had very little in common.
- It's worth trying.
Are you old Mrs. Plummett?
She was deaf.
Perhaps you'd better shout.
Are you old Mrs. Plummett?
No, there's nobody there at all.
How disappointing.
Just as we were getting on so nicely.
Violet, be quiet.
Well, I'm afraid there's nothing for it but for me to go into a trance.
Excuse me a moment while I start the gramophone again.
- Not "Always." Don't play "Always."
- I'm afraid I must.
It would be imprudent to change horses in midstream, if you know what I mean.
Oh, well. Have it your own way.
Little Tommy Tucker sings for his supper.
What shall we give him... but brown bread and butter?
That would be Daphne.
She ought to have had her adenoids out.
George, please!
- Good heavens.
- Shh!
It's trying to get away.
I can't hold it.
Press down hard.
Ought we to pick it up or leave it where it is?
- How the devil should I know?
- Well, there's no need to snap at me.
- I suppose we'd better pick it up.
- Leave it where it is.
- Who said that?
- Who said what?
- Somebody said, "Leave it where it is."
- Nonsense, dear.
- I heard it distinctly.
- Nobody else did, did they?
I never heard a sound.
It was you, Ruth.
You're playing tricks.
I'm doing nothing of the sort.
I haven't uttered.
Good evening, Charles.
Ventriloquism.
That's what it is - ventriloquism.
- What's the matter with you?
- You must have heard that.
- One of you must have heard that.
- Heard what?
You mean to sit there solemnly and tell me that none of you heard anything at all?
- I certainly didn't.
- Neither did I. I wish I had.
I should love to hear something.
It's you who are playing the tricks, Charles.
You're acting to try and frighten us.
I'm not. I swear I'm not.
It's difficult to think of what to say after seven years... but I suppose that "good evening" is as good as anything else.
- Who are you?
- Elvira, of course. Don't be so silly.
I can't bear this another minute.
Get up, everybody. The entertainment's over.
Charles, how tiresome of you.
Just as we were beginning to enjoy ourselves.
Never again. That's all I can say.
Never, never again, as long as I live.
Did you hear something we didn't hear, really?
- No, of course not. I was only pretending.
- I knew you were.
Oh, dear! Look at Madame Arcati.
- What are we to do with her?
- Bring her round.
Bring her round as soon as possible.
She's out, all right.
Bring her round.
It's dangerous to leave her like this.
Really, Charles, you're behaving most peculiarly.
Madame Arcati, wake up!
Time to go home!
- Now steady, steady on.
- Get some brandy. Give her some brandy.
What on earth is the matter with you?
Get some brandy!
Here, Bradman, give me a - Help me.
I'll take the feet.
Lift her into the chair.
Wake up, Madame Arcati.
Little Tommy Tucker, Madame Arcati!
Here's the brandy.
She's coming round.
Be careful, Charles.
You're spilling it down her dress.
Well, that's that.
- Are you all right?
- Certainly I am, my dear.
I never felt better in my life.
Well, what happened?
Was it satisfactory?
Oh, nothing much happened, Madame Arcati, after you went off.
No, something happened, all right.
I can feel it.
No poltergeists at any rate.
That's a good thing.
- Any apparitions?
- Not a thing.
What, no ectoplasm?
I'm not quite sure what that is, but I don't think so.
Curious. I feel as if something tremendous had taken place.
Charles pretended he heard a voice to try and frighten us.
It was only a joke.
A poor one, if I may say so.
Nevertheless, I'm prepared to swear that there's someone else psychic in this room apart from myself.
I don't really see how there could be,
Madame Arcati.
I do hope I haven't gone and released something.
However, we are bound to find out within a day or two.
If any manifestations should occur or you hear any unexpected noises... you might let me know at once.
Oh, of course we will.
We'll get in touch with you immediately.
- Well, I really think I must be on my way now.
- Wouldn't you like something before you go?
Oh, no, thank you. I have some Ovaltine all ready in a saucepan at home.
It only needs hotting up.
Good-bye, Mrs. Condomine.
It was sweet of you to take all this trouble.
Well, I'm so sorry so little occurred.
It's that cold of Daphne's, I expect.
You know what children are when there's anything wrong with them.
- We must try again some other evening.
- That would be lovely.
- Good night, Mrs. Bradman.
- It was thrilling. It really was.
I felt the table absolutely shaking under my hands.
- Good night, Doctor.
- Congratulations, Madame Arcati.
I'm fully aware of the irony in your voice, Dr. Bradman.
As a matter of fact, you'd make an excellent subject for telepathic hypnosis.
A great chum of mine's an expert.
I'd like her to look you over.
I'm sure I should be charmed.
- Well, good night, everyone.
- Good night.
Good night.
Thank you. Next time we must really put our backs into it.
Good night.
Be careful, Mrs. Condomine.
She might hear you.
I can't help it.
I've been holding this in for ages.
But do you really think she believes -
Of course not.
The whole thing's a put-up job.
I must say, though, she shoots a more original line than they generally do.
I hope Mr. Condomine got all the atmosphere he wanted for his book.
He would have got a great deal more if he hadn't spoiled it by showing off.
I'm really very cross with him.
I suddenly felt a draft.
There must be a window open.
No, they're shut.
Perhaps it was one of those whatchamacallims
Madame Arcati was talking about.
- Elementals?
- No, it couldn't be.
She distinctly said it was the wrong time of the year for elementals.
Well, the old girl went pedaling off down the drive at a hell of a speed.
- We had a bit of trouble lighting her lamp.
- Poor thing.
I've got a theory about her, you know.
- I believe she's completely sincere.
- Charles, how could she be?
Well, we must be going.
I've got to get up abominably early tomorrow.
I have a patient being operated on in Canterbury.
It's been a thrilling evening.
I shall never forget it.
- It was sweet of you to include us.
- Good night, Mrs. Condomine. Thank you so much.
Are you sure you won't have a drink before you go?
Quite sure, thanks.
I must do a little reading up on the whole business, just for the fun of it.
We'll let you know if we find any poltergeists whirling about.
- I should never forgive you if you didn't.
- Come along, darling.
- Well, darling?
- Well?
Would you say the evening had been profitable?
Mmm. I suppose so.
- What's the matter?
- Matter?
Yes. You seem odd somehow.
- Do you feel quite well?
- Mmm, fine.
- I think I'll have a drink. Do you want one?
- No, thank you, dear.
Brr! It's getting very chilly -
Oh, my God!
Charles!
That was very clumsy, Charles dear.
Elvira, then it's true.
It - It was you.
Of course it was.
Charles, darling.
Charles, what are you talking about?
Are you a - a ghost?
I suppose I must be.
It's all very confusing.
What do you keep looking over there for?
Look at me. What's happened?
- Don't you see?
- See what?
Elvira.
- Elvira?
- Yes.
Elvira dear, this is Ruth.
Ruth, this is Elvira.
Come and sit down, darling.
What, do you mean to say you can't see her?
Look, Charles, you just sit down quietly by the fire, and I'll fix you another drink.
Don't worry about the mess on the carpet.
Edith can clean that up in the morning.
But you must be able to see her.
She's here. Look. Right in front of you here.
Look, Charles, if this is a joke, it's gone far enough.
- Now sit down and don't be idiotic.
- What am I to do?
What the devil am I to do?
Well, I really think you might be a little more pleased to see me.
After all, you conjured me up.
I didn't do any such thing.
Nonsense. Of course you did.
That awful child with the cold came and told me that you wanted to see me urgently.
It was all a mistake, a horrible mistake.
Stop talking like that, Charles.
As I told you before, the joke's gone far enough.
I've gone mad. That's what it is.
I've just gone raving mad.
Now sit down.
Why are you so anxious for me to sit down?
What good will that do?
I want you to relax.
You can't relax standing up.
African natives can.
They can stand on one leg for hours.
I don't happen to be an African native.
- You don't happen to be a what?
- An African native.
What's that got to do with it?
It doesn't matter, Ruth.
It really doesn't matter.
We will say no more about it.
- Look. I've sat down.
- Here. Drink this.
- Would you like some more?
- Yes, please.
Very unwise.
You always had a weak head.
I could drink you under the table.
There's no need to be aggressive, Charles.
I'm doing my best to help you.
Sorry.
Now, drink this, and then we can go upstairs to bed.
Get rid of her, Charles.
Then we can talk in peace.
That's a thoroughly immoral suggestion.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
What is there immoral in that?
- I wasn't talking to you, Ruth.
- Who were you talking to then?
- Elvira, of course.
- Oh, to blazes with Elvira!
- There now. She's getting cross.
- I don't blame her.
Now look here, Charles. I gather you've got some sort of plan behind all this.
- I'm not quite a fool.
- Ruth, Elvira is here.
She's standing a few yards away from you.
Yes, dear. I can see her distinctly - under the piano with a zebra.
- But, Ruth -
- I am not going to stay here arguing any longer.
- Hooray.
- Shut up.
- How dare you speak to me like that!
- But listen, Ruth, please -
I will not listen to any more of this nonsense.
I'm going upstairs to bed now.
I shall leave you to turn out the lights.
I won't be asleep -
I'm much too upset - so you can come in and say good night to me if you feel like it.
Well, that's big of her, I must say.
Be quiet!
You're behaving like a guttersnipe.
That is all I have to say.
Good night, Charles.
That was one of the most enjoyable half hours I've ever spent.
- Oh, Elvira, how could you?
- Poor Ruth.
This is obviously some sort of hallucination, isn't it?
I'm afraid I don't know the technical term for it.
Well, where have you come from?
Do you know, it's very peculiar, but I've sort of forgotten.
Are you to be here indefinitely?
I'm afraid I don't know that either.
Why? Would you hate it so much if I was?
Well, you must admit it would be embarrassing.
I don't see why really.
It's all a question of adjusting yourself.
Anyway, I think it's horrid of you to be so unwelcoming and disagreeable.
- Now look here, Elvira.
- I do. I think you're mean.
Well, try to see my point of view, dear.
I've been married to Ruth for five years and you've been dead for seven.
Not dead, Charles. Passed over.
It's considered very vulgar to say "dead" where I come from.
Passed over then.
I don't believe you love me anymore.
I shall always love the memory of you.
Well, I really am a little hurt.
You called me back, and at greet inconvenience I came... and you've been thoroughly churlish ever since I arrived.
Believe me, Elvira, I most emphatically did not call you back.
- There's been some mistake.
- Perhaps it was your subconscious.
You must find out if you're going to stay or not, and we can make arrangements accordingly.
- I don't see how I can.
- Well, try and think.
Isn't there anyone that you know that you can get in touch with over there... or on the other side or whatever it's called who can advise you?
No. I can't think.
It all seems so far away, as though I'd dreamed it.
Oh, Charles.
What is it?
- I want to cry, but I don't think I'm able to.
- What do you want to cry for?
Well, it's seeing you again, and you being so irascible like you always used to be.
- I don't mean to be irascible, Elvira.
- Darling, I don't mind really. I never did.
Is it cold being a ghost?
No, I don't think so.
What happens if I touch you?
I doubt if you can.
Do you want to?
Oh, Elvira.
What is it, darling?
Oh, it certainly does seem strange seeing you again.
That's better.
What's better?
Your voice was kinder.
Was I ever unkind to you when you were alive?
Often.
Oh, how can you?
I'm sure you're exaggerating.
Not at all.
You were an absolute pig that time we went to Cornwall and stayed in that awful hotel.
You hit me with a billiard cue.
Mmm. Only very, very gently.
I loved you very much.
I loved you too.
No, I can't touch you.
Isn't that horrible?
Hmm. Perhaps it's just as well if I'm to stay here for any length of time.
I suppose I shall wake up eventually, but I feel strangely peaceful now.
That's right. Put your head back.
Like this?
Can you feel anything?
Only a very little breeze through my hair.
Well, that's better than nothing.
I suppose if I'm really out of my mind, they'll put me in an asylum.
Don't you worry about that. Just relax.
Poor Ruth.
Mmm. Nuts to Ruth.
Good morning, Edith.
- Good morning, sir.
- Feeling fit?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- How's Cook?
- I don't know, sir. I haven't asked her.
You should. You should begin every day by asking everyone how they are.
- It oils the wheels.
- Yes, sir.
- Greet her for me, will you?
- Yes, sir.
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning, Charles.
- It certainly is.
- What certainly is what?
A good morning.
A tremendously good morning.
There isn't a cloud in the sky, and everything looks newly washed.
Anything interesting in The Times?
Don't be silly, Charles.
- I intend to work all day.
- Good.
- It's extraordinary about daylight, isn't it?
- How do you mean?
Oh, the way it reduces everything to normal.
I'm sure I'm very glad to hear it.
- You're very glacial this morning.
- Are you surprised?
Yes. I take back what I said about it being a good morning. It's a horrid morning.
You'd better eat your breakfast while it's hot.
It isn't.
Now look here, Charles.
In your younger days, this display of roguish flippancy might have been alluring.
In a middle-aged novelist, it's nauseating.
- I don't see what I've done that's so awful.
- You behaved abominably last night.
You wounded me and insulted me.
I was the victim of an aberration.
- Nonsense. You were drunk.
- Drunk?
You had two strong dry martinis before dinner, a great deal too much burgundy at dinner... heaven knows how much port and kümmel with Dr. Bradman... while I was doing my best to entertain that madwoman.
And two large brandies later.
I gave them to you myself.
- Of course you were drunk.
- That's your story, is it?
I wasn't in the least drunk, Ruth.
Something happened to me last night.
Something very peculiar happened to me.
- I really don't wish to discuss it any further.
- But you must discuss it. It's very disturbing.
I swear to you that during the séance
I was convinced I heard Elvira's voice.
- Nobody else did.
- I can't help that. I did.
You couldn't have.
And later on, I was equally convinced she was in the room.
I saw her distinctly and talked to her.
After you'd gone up to bed, we had quite a cozy little chat.
And you seriously expect me to believe that you weren't drunk.
I know I wasn't drunk. If I'd been all that drunk,
I should have a dreadful hangover, shouldn't I?
- I'm not at all sure that you haven't.
- I haven't got a trace of a headache.
My tongue's not coated. Look at it.
I haven't the least desire to look at your tongue.
Kindly put it in again.
- Please'm.
- Yes, Edith?
Cook wants to know about lunch, ma'am.
- Will you be in to lunch, Charles?
- Oh, please, don't worry about me.
I shall be perfectly happy with a bottle of gin in my bedroom.
Don't be silly, dear.
Tell Cook we shall both be in, Edith.
Yes'm.
I'm going into Hythe this morning.
Is there anything you want?
Yes, a great deal, but I doubt if you could get it in Hythe.
I've put Alka-Seltzer down on my list.
Women! What I think of women.
Your view of women is academic, to say the least of it.
Just because you've always been dominated by them... it doesn't necessarily follow that you know anything about them.
I've never been dominated by anyone.
You were hagridden by your mother till you were 23.
Then you got into the clutches of that awful Mrs. Whatever-her-name-was.
- Mrs. Winthrop-Llewellyn.
- I'm not interested.
Then there was Elvira.
She ruled you with a rod of iron.
Elvira never ruled anyone.
She was far too elusive.
That was one of her greatest charms.
Then there was Maud Charteris.
If you wish to make an inventory of my sex life, dear...
I think it only fair to tell you that you've missed out several episodes.
I'll consult my diary and give you a complete list after lunch.
- Charles.
- Yes?
Alcohol will ruin your whole life if you allow it to get a hold on you, you know.
Once and for all, Ruth,
I'd like you to understand... that what happened last night was nothing whatever to do with alcohol.
I grant you, it may have been some form of psychic delusion... but I was stone-cold sober from first to last and extremely upset into the bargain.
You were upset indeed.
What about me?
You behaved with a stolid, obtuse lack of comprehension which frankly shocked me.
Instead of putting out a gentle, comradely hand to guide me... you shouted staccato orders at me like a sergeant major.
You called me a guttersnipe.
You told me to shut up.
And when I quietly suggested that we should go upstairs to bed... you said, with the most disgusting leer, it was an immoral suggestion.
I was talking to Elvira.
If you were, I can only say it conjures up a fragrant picture of your first marriage.
My first marriage was perfectly charming and I think it's in the worst possible taste for you to sneer at it.
I'm not nearly so interested in your first marriage as you seem to think I am.
It's your second marriage that is absorbing me at the moment.
It seems to me to be on the rocks.
Only because you persist in taking up this ridiculous attitude.
My attitude is that of any normal woman whose husband gets drunk and hurls abuse at her.
- I was not drunk!
- Be quiet. They'll hear you in the kitchen.
I don't care if they hear me in the Folkestone town hall!
I was not drunk!
- Did you call, sir?
- No!
Charles dear, if you weren't drunk, how do you account for it?
I can't account for it.
That's what's so awful.
- What did you have for lunch?
- You ought to know. You had it with me.
Let me see. There was lemon sole and that cheese thing.
Why should having a cheese thing for lunch make me see my deceased wife after dinner?
You never know.
It was rather rich.
Why didn't you see your dead husband then?
You had just as much of it as I did.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, of course it isn't.
- Charles dear?
- Yes?
Perhaps there's something pressing on your brain.
If there were something pressing on my brain,
I should have violent headaches, shouldn't I?
Not necessarily.
An uncle of mine had a lump the size of a cricket ball pressing on his brain for years... and he never felt a thing.
I know I should know if I had anything like that.
- He didn't.
- What happened to him?
He had it taken out, and he's been as bright as a button ever since.
Did he have any sort of delusions? I mean, did he think he saw things that weren't there?
No, I don't think so.
Well, what the blazes are we talking about him for then?
It's sheer waste of valuable time.
Well, I just brought him up as an example.
- How do you feel now?
- Physically, do you mean?
Altogether.
Apart from being worried,
I feel quite normal.
Good. You're not seeing or hearing anything in the least unusual?
Not a thing.
What's the matter now?
She's here again!
- What do you mean? Who's here again?
- Elvira.
You've absolutely ruined that border by the sundial.
It looks like a mixed salad.
Charles, pull yourself together.
It's all those nasturtiums.
They're so vulgar.
- I like nasturtiums.
- You like what?
They're all right in moderation, but in a mass like that, they look beastly.
Help me, Ruth.
You've got to help me.
- What did you mean about nasturtiums?
- Never mind about that now.
I tell you, she's here again.
You've been having some nice scenes, haven't you?
Please mind your own business.
If you behaving like a lunatic isn't my business,
I don't know what is.
I expect they were about me, weren't they?
I know I ought to feel sorry, but I'm not.
I'm delighted.
- How can you be so inconsiderate?
- Inconsiderate?
I like that.
I've done everything I can to help.
I've controlled myself admirably.
And I'd like to say here and now I don't believe a word about your beastly hallucinations.
- Ruth, please.
- Don't come near me!
Let her have a nice cry.
It'll do her good.
- You're utterly heartless.
- Heartless!
I wasn't talking to you!
I was talking to Elvira!
Very well. Go on talking to her then.
Talk to her till you're blue in the face, but don't talk to me.
- Help me, Elvira.
- How?
- Well, make her see you or something.
- Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't possibly manage that.
It's technically the most difficult business - frightfully complicated, you know.
It takes years of study.
I don't care how technical it is.
You've got to try.
You are here, aren't you?
You're not an illusion?
No, I was afraid not.
Yes, but - Well -
No, I don't mean to be rude, but you must see -
Yes, you must make me a promise in future you'll only come and talk to me when I'm alone.
Well, that's better than not seeing me at all.
- Charles.
- Yes, dear?
I'm awfully sorry I was cross.
- But, my dear -
- I understand everything now.
- I do really.
- You do?
- Of course I do.
- Look out. She's up to something.
- Will you please be quiet?
- Of course, darling.
We'll all be quiet, won't we?
We'll be as quiet as little mice.
But, Ruth dear -
Now, I want you to come upstairs with me and go to bed.
The way that woman harps on bed.
- I'll deal with you later.
- Very well, darling. Come along.
- What are you up to?
- I'm not up to anything.
I just want you to go quietly to bed and wait there till Dr. Bradman comes.
No, Ruth, you're wrong.
She'll have you in a straitjacket before you know where you are.
Listen, Ruth. If I promise to go to bed, will you let me stay here for five minutes longer?
- I really think it would be much better -
- No, now bear with me.
However mad it may seem, bear with me for just five minutes longer.
Very well. What is it?
Sit down.
- All right. There.
- Now listen. Listen carefully.
Have a cigarette.
It'll soothe your nerves.
- I don't want a cigarette.
- Then you shan't have one, darling.
I want to explain to you calmly and without emotion... that beyond any shadow of doubt, the ghost or shade or whatever you like to call it... of my first wife, Elvira, is in this room now.
Yes, dear.
I know you don't believe me and you're trying valiantly to humor me... but I'm going to prove it to you.
- Promise you'll do what I ask.
- Well, that depends on what it is.
Ruth, you see this bowl of flowers on the table?
Yes, dear, I did them myself this morning.
- Very untidily, if I may say so.
- You may not.
Very well.
I never will again, I promise.
Elvira will now carry the bowl of flowers over to you and back again.
You will, Elvira, won't you?
Just to please me?
Well, just once, please.
Thank you.
Now watch carefully, Ruth.
Yes, dear.
Go on, Elvira.
Take them over to Ruth.
How dare you, Charles?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
What on earth for?
It's a trick. I know it's a trick.
You've been working up to this.
It's all part of some horrible plan.
It isn't. I swear it isn't.
Elvira, for heaven's sake, do something else.
Certainly. Anything to oblige.
You want to get rid of me.
You're trying to drive me out of my mind!
- Oh!
- I'm not going to put up with this any longer!
- You must believe me! You must!
- Let me go immediately!
- That was Elvira! I swear it was.
- Let me go.
Ruth, please!
Charles, this is madness, sheer madness.
It's some sort of autosuggestion, isn't it?
Some form of hypnotism.
- Swear to me it's only that.
- Hypnotism, my foot!
Oh, my dear Mrs. Condomine, how nice of you to call.
- I do hope it isn't inconvenient.
- Inconvenient? Good heavens, no.
Come inside.
Oh, do go into the sitting room,
Mrs. Condomine.
You're just in time for a cup of tea - that is, if you don't mind China.
- Not at all.
- I never touch Indian. It upsets my vibrations.
Well, do come and sit down.
Good egg.
I'll have this made in a jiffy.
Madame Arcati, I'm profoundly disturbed, and I want your help.
Splendid. I thought as much.
Now, fire away.
Well, it's most awfully difficult to explain.
Well, facts first. Explanations afterwards.
It's the facts that are so difficult to explain.
They're so fantastic.
Facts very often are.
Come now, take the plunge.
Out with it.
You've heard strange noises in the night, no doubt.
Boards creaking, doors slamming.
Subdued moaning in the passages.
- Isn't that it?
- No, I'm afraid it isn't.
No sudden gusts of cold wind, I hope?
No. It's worse than that.
I'm all attention.
I know it sounds idiotic... but the other night, during the séance, something happened.
I knew it.
Probably a poltergeist.
They're enormously cunning, you know.
They sometimes lie doggo for days.
Poltergeist! Poltergeist!
Pretty poltergeist!
Oh!
Now carry on. I'm all ears.
You know my husband was married before.
Yes. I had heard it mentioned.
His first wife, Elvira, died comparatively young.
She was convalescing from pneumonia, and, one evening... she began to laugh helplessly at one of the BBC musical programs... and died of a heart attack.
Just a moment, please.
- Now, where did she die?
- In our present house.
I'm beginning to see daylight.
She materialized the other evening after I'd gone.
Not to me, but to my husband.
Capital! Capital!
Oh, but that's splendid!
At last! At last!
A genuine materialization!
Please sit down, Madame Arcati.
How could anyone sit down at such a moment?
It's tremendous.
I haven't had such a success since the Sudbury case.
Nevertheless, I must insist upon you sitting down... and controlling your natural exuberance.
I fully appreciate your pride in your achievement... but I would like to point out it's made my position in the house untenable... and I hold you entirely responsible.
Oh, forgive me, Mrs. Condomine.
I'm being abominably selfish.
- How can I help you?
- How?
By sending her back immediately to where she came from, of course.
Well, where is she now?
My husband's driven her into Folkestone.
Apparently she was anxious to see an old friend of hers who's staying at the Grand.
This whole business is very difficult for Ruth.
We must be fair.
Well, she should learn to be more adaptable.
She probably will in time.
I doubt it, Charles.
She's got a hard mouth.
It's her mouth that gives her away.
Her mouth's got nothing to do with it.
I resent your discussing Ruth as though she were a horse.
I- I take it your husband was devoted to her.
I believe so.
Husband devoted.
It was apparently a reasonably happy marriage.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
You say she's visible only to your husband?
Yes.
Visible only... to husband.
Audible, too, I presume.
Extremely audible.
Extremely... audible.
Do you love her?
Yes, of course.
As much as you loved me?
Don't be silly.
It's entirely different.
You always behaved very badly... and I'm grieved to see that your sojourn in the other world... hasn't improved you in the least.
The time has come for me to admit to you frankly, Mrs. Condomine... that I haven't the faintest idea how to get rid of her.
Do you mean to sit there and tell me... that having mischievously conjured up this ghost or spirit or whatever she is... and placed me in a hideous position... you are unable to do anything about it?
Well, honesty is the best policy.
But this is outrageous. I -
I ought to hand you over to the police.
You go too far, Mrs. Condomine.
I go too far? Indeed.
Do you realize what your insane, amateur muddling has done?
I have been a professional ever since I was a child, Mrs. Condomine.
"Amateur" is a word that I cannot tolerate.
It seems to me to be the height of amateurishness... to evoke malignant spirits and not be able to get rid of them.
I resent your tone, Mrs. Condomine.
I really do.
You most decidedly have no right to.
You are to blame for the whole horrible situation.
May I remind you that I came to your house on your own invitation.
On my husband's invitation.
The whole thing was planned in order for him to get material... for a mystery story he's writing about a homicidal medium.
Am I to understand that I was only invited in a spirit of mockery?
No, no, no. Not at all. He merely wanted to make notes of some of the tricks of the trade.
Tricks of the trade?
Insufferable!
I've never been so insulted in my life!
I feel we have nothing more to say to one another, Mrs. Condomine.
But, Madame Arcati, please.
Your attitude from the outset has been most unpleasant.
Some of your remarks have been discourteous in the extreme.
And I would like to say, without umbrage... that if you and your husband have been foolish enough to tamper with the unseen... for paltry motives and in a spirit of ribaldry... whatever has happened to you is your own fault.
And to coin a phrase... as far as I'm concerned, you can stew in your own juice!
Good afternoon, Mrs. Condomine.
What on earth are you doing here?
- I've been calling on Madame Arcati.
- Whatever for?
To get rid of me, of course.
To get me exorcized.
- Is that true, Ruth?
- Is what true?
That you went to Madame Arcati to get Elvira exorcised.
We discussed the possibilities.
There's a snake in the grass for you.
I'm afraid Elvira's sitting here.
Oh, to blazes with Elvira!
You know, Charles, she's absolutely ruined this room.
She's done nothing of the kind.
It's all a question of taste.
My poor darling Charles.
As far as taste is concerned, your second marriage was a disaster.
Just look at that awful picture and that terrifying dress.
- But what's the matter with it?
- What's the matter with what?
I think it's very charming.
Really, this situation is impossible, and you know it.
If only you'd make an effort to be a little more friendly to Elvira... we might all have quite a jolly time.
I have no wish to have a jolly time with Elvira.
She's certainly very bad-tempered, isn't she?
I can't think why you married her.
- Where is she at the moment?
- She's on the - Mmm? In the chair.
Oh, you are sweet, Charles darling.
I worship you.
I want to be perfectly frank with you, Elvira.
Hold on to your hats, boys.
I admit I did see Madame Arcati with a view to having you exorcized.
I think if you'd been in my position, you would have done exactly the same.
What did Madame Arcati say?
- She said she couldn't do a thing.
- Hooray.
Don't be upset, Ruth dear.
We shall adjust ourselves, you know.
You must admit it's a unique position.
I can see no reason why we shouldn't get a great deal of fun out of it.
Fun? How can you, Charles?
- You must be out of your mind.
- Yes, I thought I was at first.
But now I must admit
I'm beginning to enjoy myself.
Oh! This is intolerable!
For heaven's sake, don't get into another state.
I have been doing my level best to control myself since yesterday morning... and I am not going to do it anymore!
I don't like Elvira any more than she likes me.
And what's more, I'm sure
I never could have - dead or alive.
Lf, since her untimely arrival the other evening... she'd shown the slightest sign of good manners, the slightest sign of breeding...
I might have felt differently toward her.
As it is, all she's done is try to make mischief between us... to have private jokes with you against me.
First thing tomorrow, I'm going up to London to interview the Psychical Research Society.
And if they fail me, I shall go straight to the Archbishop of Canterbury.
I shall be back on the 6:45.
You and Elvira can have the house to yourselves... and joke and gossip with each other to your heart's content.
It's clouding over.
You have a genius for understatement.
Edith!
Cook. What on earth's happened?
Where's Edith?
Charles.
Nothing to worry about, Mrs. Condomine.
It's only a slight strain.
Oh! I'm so relieved.
But who was in the ambulance?
That, dear, was the gardener.
Men are much worse patients than women, you know.
- Particularly highly strung men like your husband.
- Is he highly strung, do you think?
- I'm afraid he's been overworking lately.
- Overworking?
He's in rather a nervous condition.
Nothing serious, you understand.
- What makes you think so?
- I know the symptoms.
What symptoms?
Oh, it's nothing to be unduly alarmed about.
A certain air of strain, an inability to focus his eyes on the person he's talking to... a few rather marked irrelevancies in his conversation.
I see. Can you remember any specific example?
Oh, yes. He suddenly shouted,
"What are you doing in the bathroom?"
And then a little later when I was writing him a prescription... he suddenly said,
"For heaven's sake, behave yourself."
How extraordinary.
And how is poor Edith?
She'll be all right in a few days.
It's only a slight concussion.
How does it feel now?
All right. Is this darn sling really essential?
I had hoped to drive into Folkestone this evening.
- Be much better if you didn't.
- You could easily wait and go tomorrow.
I can't stand another of those dreary evenings at home, Charles.
It'll drive me dotty.
Besides, I haven't seen a movie for seven years.
- Let me be the first to congratulate you.
- What's that, old man?
Charles, do try to be sensible.
I implore you.
Sorry. I forgot.
You can drive the car if you go very slowly and carefully.
Use your right arm as little as possible.
Thank you.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Condomine.
- Good-bye.
I'll pop around and see you again tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Charles.
- Yes?
- Where's Elvira?
She's slipped out of the front door with Dr. Bradman.
- Are you sure she's not here?
- Yes. Quite sure.
- Good. I want to talk to you.
- Oh, dear.
You're not going to start making scenes again, are you?
This is a fight, Charles.
It's a duel to the death between Elvira and me.
Melodramatic hysteria.
The poor little thing comes back trustingly after all these years in the other world -
Elvira is about as trusting as a puff adder... and a good deal more dangerous into the bargain.
Dangerous?
She came here with one purpose and one purpose only.
And if you can't see it, you're a bigger fool than I thought you.
What purpose could she have beyond the natural desire to see me again?
After all, you must remember she was extremely attached to me, poor child.
Her purpose is perfectly obvious.
It's to get you to herself forever.
- That's absurd. How could she?
- By killing you off, of course.
Killing me off? You're mad.
Doesn't it strike you as peculiar that you, Cook, Edith and Webb... all met with violent accidents on the same day?
Yes, but why should she want to kill me?
I could understand her wanting to kill you, but why me?
If you were dead, it would be her final triumph over me.
She'd have you forever on her beastly astral plane, and I'd be left high and dry.
She's probably planning some sort of spiritual remarriage.
I wouldn't put anything past her.
Ruth.
For heaven's sake, stop looking like a wounded spaniel and concentrate.
This is serious.
I'm going to see Madame Arcati.
I don't care how cross she is.
She's got to help us.
Even if she can't get rid of Elvira... she must know some technical method of rendering her harmless.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tell Elvira I've gone to see the vicar.
- This is appalling.
- Never mind about that.
Remember now, don't give yourself away by so much as the flick of an eyelid.
- Look out.
- What?
I- I merely said it was a nice lookout.
What is a nice lookout?
The-The weather, Elvira.
I find it very difficult to believe that at this particular moment... you and Ruthie can't think of anything more interesting to talk about than the weather.
Ah, but the glass has gone down and down and down.
It's positively macabre.
Charles and I were not discussing the weather, Elvira.
I was trying to persuade him not to drive you into Folkestone this evening.
It would be bad for his arm, and you can easily wait and go tomorrow.
However, as he seems determined to place your wishes before mine in everything...
I really have nothing further to say.
I'm sure I hope you both enjoy yourselves very much.
Are you ready?
- What for?
- To go to Folkestone, of course.
I just want a glass of sherry first.
I don't believe you want to take me at all.
Of course I want to take you, but I still think it would be more sensible to wait until tomorrow. It's a filthy night.
- Oh, how familiar all this is.
- In what way familiar?
All through our married life,
I only had to suggest something... for you immediately to start hedging me off.
I wasn't hedging you off.
I merely said that I thought...
Oh, all right. We'll spend another nice cozy, intimate evening at home... with Ruth sewing away at that hideous table center... and snapping at us like a terrier.
Ruth is perfectly aware the table center is hideous.
It happens to be a birthday present for her mother.
If you don't behave,
I shan't take you into Folkestone ever.
Oh, please, Charles, don't be elderly and grand with me.
- Please let's go now.
- Not until I've had my sherry.
Besides, the car won't be back for half an hour at least.
- What do you mean?
- Ruth's taken it.
- She had to go and see the vicar.
- What?
What's the matter?
You say that Ruth has taken the car?
Yes, to go and see the vicar, but she won't be long.
Oh, Charles. Oh, Charles.
What are you behaving like that for?
What have you done?
Done? I haven't done anything.
- Elvira, you're lying.
- I'm not lying. What's there to lie about?
- What are you in such a state for?
- I'm not in a state. I don't know what you mean.
- You've done something dreadful.
- Don't look at me like that, Charles.
- I haven't. I swear I haven't.
- The car. That's it - the car.
No, Charles. No.
Ruth was right. You were trying to kill me.
You've done something to the car.
Oh, oh, oh.
Ruth!
Ruth!
Hello. Yes?
Speaking. Yes?
The bridge at the bottom of the hill.
Yes, yes. I'll come at once.
Ruth.
Well, of all the filthy low-down tricks.
Ow! Ruth!
Stop it! Get away from me!
Leave me alone! Oh!
Leave me alone!
Oh! Ruth!
Leave me alone!
Oh, Ruth!
I didn't mean it! Ow!
Come in.
Thank you, Edith.
Oh.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Mr. Condomine.
Um, I hope you won't consider this an intrusion, Mr. Condomine... but I felt a tremendous urge - like a rushing wind - so I hopped on my bike, and here I am.
I reproach myself bitterly, you know.
I threw up the sponge.
In a moment of crisis,
I threw up the sponge... instead of throwing down the gauntlet.
Yes, well, whatever you threw, Madame Arcati,
I'm afraid there's nothing whatever to be done.
Oh, but there is. There is.
I found a formula.
It came to me last night, Mr. Condomine.
It came to me in a blinding flash.
I'd just finished my Ovaltine and turned out the light... when I suddenly started up in bed with a loud cry.
"Great Scott!" I said. "I've got it!"
And at 3:00 in the morning, with my brain fairly seething...
I went to work on my crystal for a little.
Pluck up your heart, Mr. Condomine.
All is not lost.
Well, I'm very glad to hear it, but I think we should leave things as they are for the present.
I- I-I - Mr. Condomine?
If you'll pardon my bluntness, Mr. Condomine,
I think you're a blithering idiot.
You're at liberty to think whatever you please.
Oh, well, have it your own way,
Mr. Condomine... but I warn you that it's no good locking the stable door after the horse is gone.
Hmm!
Charles, I can't stand this house another minute.
Really, Elvira, I'm surprised at you.
I don't care how surprised you are.
I want to go home.
- Now don't be childish.
- I'm not being childish.
Ruth has hardly left my side for a minute.
- Well, is she here now?
- No. She's upstairs lying down.
The funeral exhausted her.
This whole thing has been a failure.
A dreary, miserable failure, and, oh, what high hopes I started out with.
You can't expect much sympathy from me, you know.
I'm perfectly aware that your highest hope was to murder me.
Don't put it like that.
It sounds so beastly.
Anyway, it was only because I loved you.
The silliest thing I ever did in my whole life was to love you.
You were always unworthy of me.
That remark comes perilously near impertinence, Elvira.
I sat there on the other side day after day just longing for you.
I did. Really.
That was why I put myself down for a return visit... and had to fill in all those forms... and wait about in drafty passages for hours.
If only you'd died before you met Ruth, everything might have been all right.
She's absolutely ruined you.
I hadn't been in the house for a day before I realized that.
Your books aren't a quarter as good as they used to be either.
That's entirely untrue.
Ruth helped me and encouraged me in my work, which is more than you ever did.
I should think that's probably what's wrong with it.
All you thought about was going to parties and enjoying yourself.
Well, why shouldn't I have fun?
I died young, didn't I?
You needn't have died at all if you hadn't been idiotic enough... to go out in that punt with Guy Henderson and get soaked to the skin.
It was not a punt.
It was a little launch.
I don't care if it was a three-masted schooner.
You had no right to go.
You behaved abominably over Guy Henderson.
There's no use pretending you didn't.
Guy adored me.
And anyway, he was very attractive.
You told me distinctly that he didn't attract you in the least.
Well, you'd have gone through the roof if I'd told you that he did.
Anyway, you seem to forget why I went.
You seem to forget that you spent the entire evening making sheep's eyes... at that overblown harridan in the false pearls.
A woman in Cynthia Cheviot's position would hardly wear false pearls.
Well, they were practically all she was wearing.
Yes, I'm pained to observe that seven years in the echoing vaults of eternity... have in no way impaired your native vulgarity.
That was the remark of a pompous ass.
I'm sick of these insults.
Please go away.
There's nothing I should like to do better.
You've got to get hold of that old gal again and set her to work.
I won't tolerate this another minute.
For heaven's sake, don't snivel.
She's got to get me out of this.
I want to go home.
I quite agree, and the sooner the better.
On looking back on our married years, Elvira...
I see now with horrid clarity that they were nothing but a mockery.
You invite mockery, Charles.
Something to do with your personality,
I think - a certain seedy grandeur.
- Now once and for all -
- You never suspected it... but I laughed at you steadily from the altar to the grave.
All your ridiculous petty jealousies and your fussings and fumings.
You were feckless and irresponsible and morally unstable.
I realized that before we left Budleigh Salterton.
Nobody but a monumental bore... would have thought of having a honeymoon in Budleigh Salterton.
And what is the matter with Budleigh Salterton?
I was an eager young bride, Charles.
I wanted glamour and music and romance.
What I got was potted palms seven hours of every day on a damn golf course... and a three-piece orchestra playing Merrie England.
- Pity you didn't tell me so at the time.
- I did, but you wouldn't listen.
That was why I went out on the moors that day with Captain Bracegirdle.
I was desperate.
You swore to me that you'd gone over to see your aunt in Exmouth.
Mmm, it was the moors.
With Captain Bracegirdle.
With Captain Bracegirdle.
With Captain Brace -
I might have known it.
What a fool I was.
What a blind fool.
- Did he make love to you?
- Of course.
- Oh, Elvira.
- Only very discreetly.
He was in the cavalry, you know.
All I can say is that I'm well rid of you.
Unfortunately, you're not.
With any luck, I soon will be.
Ah, Mr. Condomine.
Well, I can't say I'm entirely surprised.
I'm afraid I've broken your -
Do come inside.
Oh, take off your coat.
Just sling it over the bannisters.
Madame Arcati, I want you to meet my first wife, Elvira.
Oh. Oh, my dear. How do you do?
No, she's not there.
She's, uh, in the doorway.
Are you happy, my dear?
Tell the silly old bag to mind her own business.
Was the journey difficult?
- Are you weary?
- Oh, she's dotty.
This is wonderful. Wonderful.
I almost have contact.
- I can sense the vibrations.
- But, Madame Arcati, she's gone in there.
How fascinating.
Very interesting.
I smell ectoplasm strongly.
What a disgusting thing to say.
Well, go on, Elvira. Don't be a spoilsport.
Give her a bit of encouragement.
Oh, all right. Not that I approve of these
Maskelyne and Devant carryings-on.
Yes, yes. Again. Again.
- Oh!
- How's that?
This is first-rate. It really is first-rate.
Absolutely stunning.
I'm so glad you're pleased.
You darling. You little darling.
Oh, stop her fawning on me, Charles, or I'll break something.
Madame Arcati, Elvira and I have discussed the whole situation... and she wishes to go home immediately.
- Home?
- Well, wherever she came from.
Oh, you don't think she'd like to stay a few days longer... while I try to get things a little more organized?
No, no, no. I want to go now.
You said something about a formula.
What is it?
- Oh, very well. If you insist.
- I most emphatically do insist.
- Oh, Charles.
- Shut up.
All right.
I can't guarantee anything, you know.
- I'll do my best, but it may not work.
- What is the formula?
Nothing more than a little verse really.
It fell into disuse after the 17th century.
Oh, I shall need some pepper and salt.
Ah. Yes.
We ought of course to have some shepherd's wort and a frog or two... but I daresay I can manage without.
- Is this enough?
- Yes, thanks.
Now, let me see.
Ah, yes. Sprinkle it, will you?
Just a soupçon.
There, right in the middle.
This is going to be a flop.
I can tell you that here and now.
Oh, steady, steady, steady.
And now a few snapdragons out of that vase.
There's a good chap.
If that Mr. Emsworth of the Psychical
Research Society could see me... he'd have a fit, he would really.
Now then, sit down, Mr. Condomine.
And rest your hands on the table, but don't put your fingers in the pepper.
I shall switch out the lights myself.
Oh, shucks! I'd almost forgotten.
One triangle... one half circle... and one little dot... there.
Merlin does this sort of thing at parties and bores us all stiff with it.
It's a waste of time.
She's a complete fake.
Anything's worth trying.
I am as anxious for it to succeed as you are.
Don't make any mistake about that, but I'll lay you 10-to-1 it's a dead failure.
Now, Mr. Condomine... if your wife would be kind enough to lie down on the sofa.
Go on, Elvira.
This is sheer nonsense.
Don't blame me if I get the giggles.
Concentrate. Think of nothing.
That's right. Quite right.
Now, you won't be frightened, dear, will you?
It's absolutely painless.
Arms at the sides, legs extended.
Breathe steadily.
In, out.
Is she comfortable?
- Are you comfortable, Elvira?
- No.
Yeah, she's quite comfortable.
I shall join you in a minute, Mr. Condomine.
I may have to go into a slight trance, but, if I do, pay no attention.
Hold on to yourself, Mr. Condomine.
Concentrate.
Oh, dear. It's the pepper.
Ghostly specter, ghoul or fiend, nevermore be thou convened.
Shepherd's wort and holy rite banish thee into the night.
- What a disagreeable little verse.
- Be quiet, Elvira.
Is there anyone there?
Is there anyone there?
One rap for yes.
Two raps for no.
Is there anyone there?
Good stuff!
Is that you, Daphne?
I'm sorry to bother you, dear, but Mrs. Condomine wants to return.
Now, then, Daphne.
Did you hear what I said?
Can you help us?
Hold on to it, Mr. Condomine.
It's trying to break away.
What on earth's happening?
What's the matter, Madame Arcati?
Oh, she's in one of her blasted trances again... and I'm as much here as ever I was.
Are you hurt? Wake up.
Oh, leave her alone.
She's having a whale of a time.
If I ever do get back,
I'll strangle that ruddy little Daphne.
Oh. What happened?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
- Yes, it did. Something happened.
- Yes. You fell over. That's all that happened.
- What, is she still here?
- Yes, of course.
- Something must have gone wrong.
Oh, make her do it again properly, Charles.
I'm sick of being messed about like this.
Be quiet. She's doing her best.
Something happened.
I sensed it in my trance. I felt it.
It shivered through me.
Once and for all, Charles.
What the devil does this mean?
Well, I can't think how
I can have been such a duffer.
- I only hope you're on the right track now.
- Oh, not a doubt of it, Mr. Condomine.
I think I may confidently promise you that, next time... we shall be able to kill two birds with one stone.
I can't feel your simile is entirely fortunate.
Mind my crystal, Mr. Condomine.
Ah!
Well, now that we've returned to the scene of the crime, as it were... everything will be plain sailing.
Are they gone?
- No.
- Oh.
Are they gone now?
No.
Are they gone now?
Hickory rod and birch in bud... toad in the hole and toad in the mud... broomstick, bracken and Halloween... make these furious spirits seem... nothing more than a ghastly dream.
Are they still here?
Yes.
End of Round 6.
Oh, well, cheer up, Mr. Condomine.
Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.
This is definitely one of the most frustrating nights I've ever spent.
Hmm. The reply to that is pretty obvious.
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
Oh, skip it.
Thank you, Mr. Condomine.
Oh, if you'll excuse me, I'll just have another of those delicious sandwiches.
I'm as hungry as a hunter.
- Would you like a glass of beer?
- No, thank you. Better not.
Now look here, Charles, this has gone far enough.
We've stood up, we've lain down.
We've concentrated, we've sat interminably... while that tiresome old woman recited extremely unflattering verses at us.
We've endured five séances.
We've watched her fling herself in and out of trances until we're dizzy.
And at the end of it, we find ourselves exactly where we were at the beginning... and I'm exhausted.
Well, I'm just as... exhausted as you are.
I've been doing all the blasted table tapping.
Looks as if Elvira and I will have to stay together indefinitely in this house.
You're not going to stay indefinitely in this house.
With you then.
We shall have to be with you.
Oh, I don't see why.
Why don't you take a cottage somewhere?
You called us back.
I've already explained till I'm black in the face that I did nothing of the sort.
Madame Arcati says you did.
Madame Arcati is a muddling old fool.
If she can't get us back, she can't. That's that.
We must try to think of something else.
She must get you back.
Anything else is unthinkable.
There's gratitude for you.
You called us back, and you've done nothing but try to get rid of us ever since we came.
- Hasn't he, Elvira?
- He certainly has.
And now, owing to your idiotic inefficiency, we find ourselves in this mortifying position.
We're neither fish, flesh, fowl nor... whatever it is.
Good red herring.
Are the girls getting despondent?
- Yes, I'm afraid they are rather.
- Oh. We mustn't give up hope.
Chin up, never give in.
That's my motto.
This schoolgirl phraseology is driving me mad.
Now, then.
Now, then what?
What do you say if we have another séance and really put our shoulders to the wheel?
Make it a real rouser.
If we're not very careful, she'll materialize a hockey team.
Charles, I implore you not to let her have another séance.
Now listen, Madame Arcati, before you go into any further trances...
I think we should discuss the situation a little.
Good. An excellent idea.
Well, fire away, Mr. Condomine.
Well, my wives and I have been talking it over... and they're both still absolutely convinced that I somehow or other called them back.
Very natural.
And I'm equally convinced that I did not.
Well, neither of them could have appeared unless there had been somebody - some psychic subject - in the house who wished for them.
- Yes, well, it wasn't me.
- Perhaps it was Dr. Bradman.
I never knew he cared.
Great Scott!
I believe I've been barking up the wrong tree.
- How do you mean?
- The Sudbury case.
- I don't understand.
- There's no reason why you should.
It was before your day.
I wonder. Oh, I wonder.
What was the Sudbury case?
I wish you would explain.
It was the case that made me famous,
Mr. Condomine.
It was what you might describe in theatrical parlance as my first smash hit.
I had letters from all over the world about it, especially India.
What did you do?
I dematerialized old Lady Sudbury... after she'd been firmly entrenched in the private chapel for over 17 years.
- How? Can you tell me how?
- Chance. A fluke.
I happened on it by the merest coincidence.
- What fluke? What did you do?
- All in good time. Wait.
Now, who was present during our first séance?
Only the Bradmans and Ruth and me and yourself.
To be sure. To be sure.
But the Bradmans aren't here tonight, are they?
- No.
- Quickly. My crystal.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Drat the thing, it gives me the pip.
It's cloudy again.
That's better.
It's there again. It's there again.
- I'm beginning to understand.
- I wish I was.
- What's there again?
- It's a bandage. A white bandage.
Hold on to a white bandage.
- I haven't got a white bandage.
- Shh!
She's too good, you know.
She ought to be in a circus.
Be you in nook or cranny, answer me.
Be you in still room or closet, answer me.
Be you behind the panel, above the stairs, beneath the eaves... waking or sleeping, answer me!
Well, that ought to do it or I'm a Dutchman.
- Do what?
- Shh, shh, shh! Wait.
It's near.
It's near. It's very near.
If it's a ghost, I shall scream.
Did you ring, sir?
Bandage. A white bandage.
- No, Edith.
- I'm sorry, sir.
I could've sworn I heard the bell or somebody calling.
I was asleep.
I don't rightly know which it was.
Come here, child.
Oh.
Well, go on. Go to Madame Arcati.
It's quite all right.
Who do you see in this room, child?
- Oh, dear.
- Answer, please.
- You, Madame.
- Go on.
The master.
- Anyone else?
- Oh, no, Madame.
- Look again.
- I don't understand, sir.
Oh, come child, don't beat about the bush.
Look again.
Do you see anyone else now?
- Oh, no, Madame.
- She's lying.
- Madame.
- They always do.
"They"?
Where are they now?
By the piano.
She can see them.
Do you mean to say she can see them?
Probably not very clearly, but enough.
Let me go. I haven't done nothin' nor seen anybody.
Let me go back to bed.
Get her a sandwich.
I don't want a sandwich.
I want to go back to bed.
- Oh, nonsense.
- Here you are, Edith.
A big, healthy girl like you saying no to a delicious sandwich?
I never heard of such a thing.
- Sit down, dear.
- Please, sir, I -
Now go on, Edith, do as Madame Arcati says.
If she's been the cause of all this unpleasantness...
I shall give her a week's notice tomorrow.
You may not be here tomorrow.
Now look at me, Edith.
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.
Oh, dear. What's the matter with her?
Is she barmy?
Here, Edith. This is my finger. Look.
Have you ever seen such a long, long, long finger before?
Now it's on the left.
Now it's on the right.
Backwards and forwards it goes.
Very quietly. See?
Backwards and forwards.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
The mouse ran up the clock.
Be quiet. You'll spoil everything.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
♪ Rumpty-tumty tiddle-lee-um
Hi, ditey-oh-toh ♪
- So far, so good. She's off, all right.
- Off?
She's a natural, just the same as the Sudbury case.
Really, it's the most amusing coincidence.
Now then, if you'd ask your wives to stand close together, please.
- Yes, yes. Where?
- Over there by the window.
Right.
Ruth, Elvira.
- I resent being ordered about like this.
- I'm afraid I must insist.
I don't like this.
I don't like any of it.
I feel peculiar.
It would serve you right if we flatly refused to do anything at all.
Are you sorry for having been so mischievous, Edith?
Oh, yes, Madame.
You know what to do now, don't you, Edith?
Oh, yes, Madame.
I believe it's going to work, whatever it is.
Oh, Charles.
This is good-bye, Charles.
Make her stop for a minute, Charles.
There's something I want to say before I go.
You should have thought of that before.
Too late now.
- Well, of all the mean, ungrateful -
- Charles, listen a moment.
Lights.
I saw Captain Bracegirdle again, Charles.
Several times.
I went to the Four Hundred with him twice while you were in Nottingham.
And I must say that I couldn't have enjoyed myself more.
Don't think you're getting rid of us so easily, my dear.
You may not be able to see us, but we shall be here all right.
I consider you've behaved atrociously over the whole miserable business.
They've gone.
They've really gone.
Splendid!
Hurrah! We've done it.
That's quite enough singing for the moment, Edith.
Hadn't you better wake her up?
She might bring them back again.
Wake up, child.
Wh-Where am I?
It's all right, Edith.
You can go to bed now.
But I was in bed.
How did I get down here?
I rang, Edith.
I rang the bell, and you answered it.
Did I drop off?
Do you think it's my concussion?
Now off you go, Edith.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much indeed.
Oh, sir, whatever for?
Oh, sir!
Well, what on earth did she mean by that?
Golly! What a night.
I'm ready to drop in my tracks.
I'm deeply grateful to you,
Madame Arcati.
I don't know what arrangements you generally make... but I trust that you'll send in your account in due course.
Good heavens, Mr. Condomine.
It was a pleasure.
I shouldn't dream of such a thing.
Would you like to stay?
There's a spare room, you know.
No, thanks.
Each to his own nest.
I'll pedal home in a jiffy.
It's only seven miles.
Oh, I'll collect my tackle later on.
Perhaps you'd give me the pleasure of lunching with you one day.
When you come back,
I shall be delighted.
Come back?
Take my advice, Mr. Condomine, and go away immediately.
But - What, you don't mean -
This must be an unhappy house for you, Mr. Condomine.
There must be memories both grave and gay in every corner of it.
- Also -
- Also what?
There are more things in heaven and earth,
Mr. Condomine.
Just go. Pack up your traps and go, as soon as possible.
You don't mean they might still be here?
¿Quién sabe? As the Spanish say.
Hmm. I think I will take your advice,
Madame Arcati. Thank you very much.
Well, good-bye, Mr. Condomine.
It's been fascinating.
From first to last, fascinating.
Oh, don't bother to see me out.
I can find my way.
Cheerio once more.
And good hunting.
Ruth?
Elvira?
Are you there?
Yes, I know darn well you are there.
I just want to tell you there's no use your hanging around any longer... because I'm going away.
I'm going a long way away.
Somewhere where I don't believe you'll be able to follow me.
I don't believe ghosts can travel over water.
Is that quite clear, my darlings?
You said in one of your more acid moments, Ruth... that I'd been hagridden all my life.
How right you were.
But now I'm free, Ruth dear... not only of Elvira and Mother and Mrs. Winthrop-Llewellyn... but free of you too.
And I should like to take this farewell opportunity... of saying that I'm enjoying it immensely.
Oh. Thank you.
You were very silly, Elvira, to think I didn't know all about you and Captain Bracegirdle.
I did.
And what you didn't realize was that I was extremely attached to Paula Westlake at the time.
Good-bye for the moment, my dears.
I expect we're bound to meet again one day, but until we do...
I'm going to enjoy myself as I've never enjoyed myself before.

The princess -
Have you got news for me?
No, Master.
- Dead?
- She still sleeps.
- You followed my orders?
- Yes, Master.
- And the blind man?
- He has been found.
Hmm.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
What? Your cur would bark?
Afine reward for charity.
If charity be false as that coin.
Then you cheat, son of a burnt father.
A blind man cannot tell truth from false.
Alas, I cannot tell day from night.
It was my dog.
- How can a dog tell bad from good?
- See for yourself.
Now, by the wonder of Allah -
It is a false coin, and I, myself, knew it not!
Come, O frequenter of tree trunks... now which is the bad one?
This is no dog, but the reincarnation of a tax collector!
O ye whom Allah gave
the gift of sight... to fill your eyes with beauty and delight... spare me a thought to whom your wondrous world... is but a city of eternal night.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
- Bring him to me.
- Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Pray for me.
My name is Halima.
- I do not know you?
- Does one always know one's friends?
I have none to know.
Can you not trust in one
who brings not words, but deeds♪
In my house, there is food and rest.
And what is mine is yours.
- Why should you offer this?
- For your prayers.
That is much for little.
- Take my hand.
- There's no need. My dog sees for me.
He gives me more than ever he can receive, like all dogs.
This is a sleep beyond my knowledge.
Only this I know: When the blind man comes to her, she will be cured.
Strange, Master, he can do something all your powers cannot.
I'll make him do it for me and cast him away.
But she loves the blind man.
Do you call the lisping of two children in a garden love?
Love she has yet to learn.
And I am here to teach her.
- Poor blind beggar.
- Even more unfortunate than you know.
- That cannot be.
- But we are unveiled.
And I am... veiled.
- Tell us your name.
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad!
- Ahmad, you'll beg no more.
- Nor journey on.
- Stay here with us.
O sovereigns of silkiness,
I am sure you are beautiful... but for me there is no staying.
I must on, seeking the one I love, whom I have lost.
Men with two eyes often seek all their lives and fail to find that one.
Stay. There are great doctors here.
They may restore your sight.
That would be the blackest day of all my days.
- You talk in riddles.
- I will give you the answer. Listen.
There was once a king, son of a king and of a hundred kings.
His subjects countless, his wealth untellable... his power absolute.
And this dog was not a dog... but a youth who lived in Bagdad and became dear to the king.
But in those days,
he was nothing but a little thief.
Why do you smell my fish, master of a copper coin? Be off! Be off!
Shall I call the khadi's clubmen? Eh?
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief! Stop that thief!
Ahmad the king.
Son of Akbar, grandson of Haroun-el-Rachid... the great, the illustrious... lord of the earth, defender of the faith... servant of the all-highest... but master of all men.
Ahmad the king!
Ahmad the king.
Alas, I was that mighty man.
365 wives were mine.
In my heart there was no love.
Fifty palaces, and I had no home.
Richest among my subjects,
I was the poorest of the poor.
Every desire satisfied,
I grew empty of desire.
And in my whole vast kingdom,
I could find nothing to do - no task, no aim, no purpose - for always my grand vizierJaffar stood between me and my people.
Another execution.
Why had he to die?
He had been thinking, my lord and master.
- Is it a crime then to think?
- In a subject, it's quite unpardonable.
Are men only to be ruled by fear?
Men are evil - hatred behind their eyes, lies on their lips, betrayal in their hearts.
You will learn one day, great king... that there are about three things that men respect: the lash that descends, the yoke that breaks and the sword that slays.
By the power and terror of these, you may conquer the earth.
Do I want to conquer the earth?
What do you want, my lord and master?
I thought I might try to give them happiness.
Happiness. They are fools and knaves.
Your grandsire knew it, and if you would know it too... do as he did.
One night, when darkness falls... leave your palace, go among your people... mix with the crowds, go into their houses... listen, observe and remember.
- Tonight, Jaffar.
- Tonight, my king.
- Your people, my king.
- I've never been so close to them.
Go. Listen, observe and remember.
It is told, though Allah be wiser or more merciful...
there was in the past of the ages
a king among kings...
a master of arms and of armies,
of vessels and auxiliaries.
And this master of time and people
was an oppressor to both...
and the earth was as pitch in the faces
ofhis subjects and his slaves.
- What's he saying?
- And they groaned together in secret.
Why, I don't know.
Is it the king he's talking about?
Don't ask questions.
There are spies everywhere.
You must be careful in Bagdad.
I'm a stranger here. Surely you can tell me what the old man's talking about.
Oh, about foolish hopes... about a prophecy, about a liberator.
Only fools and children believe it.
A liberator indeed.
Not while Ahmad is king.
And they groaned together in secret and were slain in the marketplace.
But a wise man among the sages of Bagdad
comforted them with a prophecy...
saying, "In the fullness of years,
a liberator shall come upon you...
"and this shall be the sign ofhim:
he shall be the lowest of the low...
and you shall look for him
in the clouds."
And the people cried,
"We shall look for him in the clouds indeed...
"for if the great are powerless
to save us from this tyrant...
how can one of no account avail?"
And the reader
of the Milky Way replied...
"Have faith, trust in Allah...
"for there, one day in the blue,
you shall see a boy...
"the lowest of the low, mounted upon a cloud.
"But the cloud shall be as strong as the hills beneath the snow...
"and from the ranges of the sky...
he shall destroy this tyrant
with the arrow ofjustice."
- What is the name of the tyrant?
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad.
I wish the miracle would happen today.
I wish he would die today.
Arrest him. Put him in prison.
When he says he's the king, tell them he's a madman.
His friends and all who might be loyal to him must be destroyed.
I learned that night not that men are evil, but that he was evil.
When he persuaded me among my people,
he laid a trap for me.
I was thrown into prison...
and there, in prison,
my life began... for there I met the one who was to become my only true friend -
Abu, the little thief of Bagdad.
For only very little thieves are thrown into prison.
No! No! Not in prison!
No! No! Not in prison!
- Don't put me in prison! No!
- Come in, thief.
Cut off his right arm, and then his left.
Then his left leg, then his right.
- And then his head.
- No! No! No! No!
I say no! No! Please, no!
Don't kill me!
- I don't want to die!
- Tomorrow morning.
And as for the madman, our great sultan Jaffar is merciful.
Only his head.
As the sun rises.
No! No, no!
- No! No, no!
Poor boy, they've driven you mad.
Me mad?
Theyjust said you were mad.
Are you really mad?
That's it. I'm mad. I must be mad.
The maddest of all the madmen that ever lived in the sultan's palace.
- You are mad, quite mad.
- What's it matter♪
In the morning, unless the sun stops still and never rises, we both die -
the thief and the madman-
and I don't want to die.
You are not mad... and maybe we shall watch the sun rise from over the river.
Didn't you hear the jailer?
"As the sun rises."
As the sun rises, we'll take a boat and go down to the sea.
I've never seen the sea... but I've heard the sailors on the riverside talk about it.
In the sea are fishes as big as the great temple... and little ones as tiny as my little finger, with wings.
And boats as big as Bagdad itself... with sails as big as clouds.
And when the wind blows, they go as fast as antelopes... and carry you to the isles of India and China.
To the isles of India and China.
And we're locked in prison.
The ax will fall as the sun rises.
And you say you're not mad.
- Look!
- What's that?
The key of the prison.
I just stole it.
- The key? Give it to me!
- Steady, steady.
You want someone to look after you.
We can't go now.
- Why not?
- We must wait. In an hour they will eat.
After they eat, they sleep.
Then we go.
Hurry! Catch this oar.
Give me that rope!
Hurry! We must get away.
Do you want us to be killed?
Do you think they will have mercy on us?
Don't you think if the king knew, he'd be merciful?
The king was a fool. I hope he suffers as much as he made the people suffer.
- Do you hate him so much?
- Everybody hated him.
Oh, if I could only lay my hands on him just once... if I could only tell him what a fool he was.
Tell it now.
I am Ahmad the king.
- Speak.
- Ahmad the king is dead.
He died yesterday.
There's a new king, Jaffar.
- Look!
Jaffar would not make all that fuss over me.
He would not send the whole guard after me.
Mercy, Master. I'm your slave.
Leave me at least one arm for small stealing, and I'll pay you twice as much in taxes.
- What's your name?
- I'm Abu the thief... son of Abu the thief, grandson of Abu the thief.
Most unfortunate of 10 sons
with a hunger that yawns day and night.
Get up, my little friend.
- We must return to Bagdad.
- How can you be such a fool?
I mean, my king would be killed.
A dead king and a dead thief cannot do much, you know.
If your fingers are as nimble as your brain, you are indeed the prince of thieves.
Come on. Let's catch the morning breeze.
That will carry us to freedom.
Freedom. Strange.
I've had everything but freedom.
And I've had nothing but freedom.
And now we've got it, what shall we do with it?
Anything we like.
In three days, we shall be in Basra.
Here. Take this pole. Push!

Basra.
Basra. How beautiful it looks.
How beautiful it smells!
Pancakes!
- Give me one!
- Really, you are a fool.
Whoever heard of eating pancakes without honey?
But how can you steal honey?
Allah give us the pancakes, and he will provide honey.
- Honey! Honey!
- Ah.
Honey! Honey!
- You buy honey?
- Yes, we are thinking of buying some.
- Uh, a jar, of course.
- Jar?
- Uh, if it's good honey.
- The best in Basra.
Uh, easy to say. First I must try.
Ahh. I've tasted better.
What do you think?
- No. No, not good enough.
- No.
- Your bees are out ofhumor.
- Take better care of them.
Hey, old friend.
Whose palace is this?
Why, the palace of the sultan, children of ignorance.
- The palace of a thousand toys.
- Toys?
Where have you come from, you beggars of no importance?
Don't you know that the sultan has the greatest collection of toys in the world?
Why toys?
The sultan is an old man, and old men are like children.
He guards his toys more jealously... than he guards his daughter.
But I say no more. Now out of my way, you masters of a thousand fleas.
Allah be with you, but I doubt it.
- What's happening?
- Let me go!
- Not until you've told us.
- The princess comes!
- Then why does everybody go?
- It's death to look on her.
- Death?
- Why?
No man has ever seen her, nor shall, till her father gives her in marriage.
- Is she so ugly?
- Her beauty is like the sun and the moon.
Let me go!
- Let us go!
- Where?
Up there!
Ah.
- Your eating will cause our death.
- Without eating, we die.
Abu! Here they come!
- I must see her again.
- But I've found Sinbad the sailor.
And he has given us two places on his ship.
It is more wonderful than I'd ever imagined.
And on the next tide, she sails.
I can't go.
I must see her again.
But, Ahmad, all my life I dreamt of going in a great ship across the world.
I can't go.
I must see her again.
If I help you to see her, will you then come with me?
I will.

No more. The music of a love song is as heavy as the noonday air.
Let us wait for the nightingale and the night.
To the pool.
Oh!
A djinni!
A djinni!
A djinni. Don't go! Don't go.
It's a djinni in the pool.
A djinni.
Are you afraid?
Yes. Terribly.
Why don't you run away♪
I want to look.
I've never seen a djinni before.
Well, then what do you see?
Remember always, to a djinni,
you must tell the truth.
You don't look wicked.
Are you a good djinni?
Not too good. Very good djinni are just as tiresome as very good men.
- Do you live down there?
- No.
- Why have you come?
- To see you.
- I was about to bathe.
- I'm waiting.
Bathe, with you there?
Give me your hand then.
Down into the water.
Oh, djinni, you've gone.
I didn't mean you to go so soon.
Shall I never see you again?
Never?
Don't be afraid.
I'm not a djinni.
Who are you?
Your slave.
Where have you come from?
From the other side of time... to find you.
How long have you been searching?
Since time began.
Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Till the end of time.
For me, there can be no more beauty in the world but yours.
For me, there can be no more pleasure in the world... than to please you.
Will you be here in the garden tomorrow at the same hour?
There's a gardener here who watches night and day.
His name is Death.
You mustn't come.
Forbid me then.
I cannot forbid.
Tomorrow!
And all tomorrows.
- Did you see her?
- I did.
Good! Then we can go with Sinbad tonight.
- No, Abu. I can't go.
- Why not? You have seen her again.
That's why I can't go - because I have seen her.
All right.
Then I'll go alone.
If you go there tomorrow again... how will you pass the guards without me to help?
- Oh, I'll find a way.
- You'll be caught.
You'll stay with me?
Oh, Abu, why should you?
You have as great a longing in your soul as I have.
- Why should you stay with me?
- Because I'm as great a fool as you are.
Brother of lions.
Fountain of hospitality.
You know, I have the largest collection of these mechanical devices... in the whole wide world.
And this is the most remarkable of them all.
I-It tells the time.
See how it works? Huh?
Sheer magic, isn't it?
I hope this dangerous device will never be allowed into the hands of the people.
- Dangerous?
- Yes.
If people once begin to know the time... they will no longer call you the king of time.
They will want to know how time is spent.
Oh, you're right.
Oh, the people must never know.
Look, look. Come.
Ah! See.
Such workmanship.
Such - Such precision.
Such reliability.
I do so prefer these things to my subjects.
Watch. Watch.
See. No, no.
That's the finest of them all.
See?
- I have only to wind a key or press a spring - and they do exactly the same thing every time... and exactly what I want.
And so often my subjects fail to do exactly what I want... and then I have to have their heads cut off.
See? Oh!
Your collection is indeed magnificent... and so near completion too.
Near completion? Huh.
I'd have you know my collection is-is the most complete completion.
Please, do not misunderstand me.
I am well aware that nothing short of a miracle could add luster... to this already dazzling display.
But such a miracle does exist.
A mechanical toy better than - than any of mine?
Knowing of your interest in these matters,
I have brought it with me.
Well, let's see it. Let's see it.
Quickly, quickly!
Oh, I can't bear to be kept waiting.
Ooh. This is exciting, this.
If Your Highness would wind it yourself.
Uh -
Oh! What's it going to do? Hmm?
Move its legs, or arch its neck?
Or- Or wag its tail? Hmm?
It doesn't kick, does it?
To tell you the truth, I'm always rather nervous of these things...
Till I know what they're going to do,
Till I get used to them.
Ooh. Ah.
It wants some winding.
- If Your Highness would mount.
- Yes.
- And now?
- Pull the reins!
Marvelous!
I am no longer a man. I am a bird!
I'm the king of birds!
Oh.
No! Oh. Mmm, I want it!
I want it. I must have it, and I'll give you anything you wish for it.
It's yours.
I ask but one thing in return.
Anything you will.
- Your daughter.
- My daughter♪
Mm-hmm.
Oh, dear, dear, dear. Really.
This is -This is very awkward.
Wh -What do you want my daughter for?
- I have to found a dynasty.
- Oh, quite, quite, quite.
I understand entirely about founding a dynasty.
Delightful thing to do.
I've tried myself, many times.
And what have I got?
A daughter.
The true offspring of the mother of miseries.
Her eyes have quarreled.
They're always trying to get at one another.
Her eyes are Babylonian eyes... and her eyebrows like the crescent moon of Ramadan.
- Her body's straight as the letter alif.
- How do you know?
- I've seen her.
- Oh, no, you -
- I have.
- Where?
- In my crystal.
- Oh, confound your crystal.
Confound all crystals.
I always did hate the things. I -
- Are you a magician?
- I have some skill.
Oh, say no more. I -
Anyhow, I - I must have this horse.
So I suppose you must have my daughter.
Mmm.
I will never marry him.
I would rather die.
I will go to my sister, who's married to he sultan of Samarkand.
She will protect me.
Go back to the garden. You will find someone there whom we thought was the djinni of the pool.
Tell him of our misfortune, and tell him that I will wait for him in Samarkand.
Yes, Princess.
Your Highness, the princess is nowhere to be found.
She is gone. We have searched
the whole garden.
- We have found only two beggars.
- Bring them here.
Jaffar! Jaffar!
Jaffar!
At last, face to face, man to man, sword to sword.
Give me a sword!
Allah will judge!
Great sultan, I speak the truth.
My eyes bear witness.
Ahmad!
My eyes!
I'm blind!
Ahmad!
Listen, great sultan,
I know the truth.
You must know who this man is!
And this - Listen, good people.
- Son of a dog.
- Allah.
By this, my magic rune... be what your fathers were... and bay the moon.
And this is my curse:
You shall remain a dog... and you shall walk in the darkness of the blind... until I hold her in my arms.
And now, dispensers of bounty, you know why a blind man with his dog... searches the world for a lost love, and with little enough hope.
Yet without that hope, there would be nothing.
And Allah is merciful.
Allah is merciful indeed, for the one that you seek is here.
If you mock me,
Allah will not forgive.
I do not mock. Your princess was captured by slave traders and sold here in our slave market.
The richest merchant in the town
bought her.
But no sooner was she taken to his house than she fell into the strangest trance.
She lives, but is as dead.
No doctor can restore her.
Night and day she calls upon the djinni of the pool.
- I was that djinni!
- And you alone can bring her back to life.
Can you take me where she is?
O djinni, shall I never see you again?
- Never?
- Lead me to her.
Why have you come?
To find you.
- How long have you been searching?
- From the beginning of time.
Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Till the end of time.
The dream - my dream - always the same dream.
This is no dream.
Ahmad!
Finish the masquerade.
Don't look at me like that.
Suffering has left its mark.
For me, your beauty will always be as I first saw it - never changing.
Your eyes -They're so strange.
So full of pain.
One cannot go through fire and not be scorched.
Ahmad, you must go.
The master has returned.
I will hide you, and when the master sleeps in the heat of the noon...
I'll bring her to you.
Quiet.
From now you're not only mine.
You belong to the princess as well.
Stay and guard her for me.
Blind. He's blind.
It is in your power to restore his sight.
There is, in this town, a famous doctor who would, at your request, cure him.
Take me.
Is the doctor here, on this ship?
Yes. He's waiting for you.
Open this door.
Open it!
Bring him nearer.
Nearer.
How do you find your dog's life, hmm?
Mmm. Strange how an unpleasant child can be a decent dog.
Throw him overboard.
Welcome.
- Jaffar!
- Yes.Jaffar.
It's always Jaffar.
Since you left your palace,
I have kept you safe.
When you rode hopeless and lost in the desert, who guided you?
When you were sold in the slave market,
who bought you♪
Always Jaffar.
It was in my house you were cared for, to sleep your sleep... and dream to its end... your first dream of love.
It was I who woke you.
No. It was Ahmad.
I was told there was a doctor here... who could restore his sight.
But I am that doctor.
The same moment that I hold you in my arms...
Ahmad will see.
Take me in your arms.
My eyes!
Hey! Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Can you see?
I'm Abu again!
Abu!
- Abu, where is she?
- She's with him -Jaffar- on the ship.
What good are my eyes to me without her?
Is there nothing for you without her?
Nothing.
No. No.
I have powers that could force you to my will.
But I want more than they can give.
I want your love.
Forget Ahmad.
He's no longer blind.
And for a man with eyes, the world is full of women.
Only I am cursed... that I can see only you.
Little fool. Trying to end your life before it has begun.
I tell you, Ahmad has forgotten.
Look!
It's Ahmad!
Wind!
Wind!
Wind!
Whip yourself, winds of heaven!
Whip till you wail aloud!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Why do you refuse to obey your destiny?
You behave like a slave girl.
I am a slave girl.
You could command me.
Try. Ask what you will.
Would you take me back to Basra?
- Helmsman!
- Master!
Northward to Basra.
This is a place of desolation.
It is the most beautiful garden in the world.
If there were ever flowers in it, they've vanished, like cancer.
And the pool - so dark with weeds... you can't even see your own reflection in it.
I'm not looking for my own reflection.
Father, I don't want to go to Bagdad with Jaffar.
- But, my dear-
- Don't let him take me.
- Don't!
- Oh, there, there, there, there, there, there.
Well, if you don't want to go to Bagdad with him, you shan't.
No. Never. Never, never, never.
Never while I live. There.
- There. Oh.
What is it?
The newest magical toy: the silver maid.
Does she do anything more?
She can embrace you.
But any of my wives will do that.
Her embrace will thrill you... as no other woman ever has... or ever will.
Do you mean I might get rid of all my wives... and have a collection of these things?
She tickles!
Guards!
Make ready for Bagdad.
Free! Free!
Free! Free! Free!
Free! Free! Free!
Free again!
Free, after 2,000 years!
2,000 years ago,
King Solomon, master of all the djinns... imprisoned me within that bottle.
For me, this is the first moment of my new freedom.
For you -
For you, this is the last moment of your life.
My life?
Your life!
In a moment I shall lift my foot and crush you... insect, beetle, worm that you are!
But, sheik of spirits,
Ifished you out of the sea.
I opened your bottle. I let you out.
You can't be so ungrateful.
Ungrateful?
Slaves are not grateful.
Not for their freedom.
Listen.
Inside my bottle for the first thousand years...
I swore that I'd enrich the one that freed me with all the riches of the earth.
But in the second thousand years, my imprisoned spirit turned to vengeance... on all that lived and were free.
And I swore that I'd kill him that freed me to satisfy that hate.
Are you ready?
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Please, before I die, may I -
May I ask one question?
Ask.
How comes it that you, as big as a mountain... could ever get into that bottle
I can hold in my hand?
You weren't ever in it really, were you?
- Of course I was.
- Oh, no, you weren't.
- I was!
- You weren't!
What? You dare doubt?
If I'm going to die in a moment, I can dare anything, and I say it's impossible.
- Impossible?
- And I don't believe you.
- Take care.
- And never shall.
- Never?
- Nothing can make me!
- Nothing?
- Nothing. Unless I see it with my own eyes.
Then, dog of an unbeliever, before you die... you shall see, with me, nothing is impossible!
You shall see and believe!
Now, you great, overblown belch!
Let me out! Let me out!
Just because you were bigger than me, you thought you could bully.
- Let me out! Let me out!
Product of inflation.
Descendant of a stink. Let you out?
I'm going to throw you back into the sea.
- This time forever.
- Oh, no. Mercy! Mercy, O Master!
- What's that?
- O great and merciful master!
- Say that again.
- O great and merciful master... let me out, and I'll grant you three wishes.
- Three wishes?
- Your first three wishes shall come true.
- You swear?
- I swear.
By King Solomon, master of all the djinn?
By King Solomon, the master of all the djinn... the oath that no spirit can break.
- And you'll behave? No threatening and shouting?
- No.
- No what?
- No, Master.
Now, don't make so much noise again.
You frightened me before.
Master, I hear and obey.
That's better.
All bullies must learn manners in the end.
I'm hungry.
Can't think with my stomach empty.
I wish I had some of those sausages
Mother used to make.
Your sausages, Master.
That was the first wish, Master.
Two more remain.
Name them.
Don't you hurry me.
I've got to be careful.
Two more.
You know what I wish?
Tell me. Where is my friend Ahmad?
Master, to know that, you must look into the All-Seeing Eye.
- Then give me the eye.
- Master, I can take you where it is... but not even I can steal it for you.
Steal? Huh!
I'll see to that.
- Little braggart. What have you ever stolen?
- What haven't I?
A key from its lock, ring from its finger, money from its purse, the strength of a djinni -
And the tongue of a liar!
But he who would steal the All-Seeing Eye... from the very brow of the goddess must be neither a thief nor a braggart, but a hero.
I always wanted to be a hero.
Come on!
Then catch on to my hair.
All right.
But mind you, this is not my second wish yet.
Now I'm rather helping you.
Yes, Master.
Djinni! Djinni!
I'm frightened!
I hear!
All right, Master?
I think so.
Where are we now?
Above the roof of the world.
Has the world got a roof?
Of course, supported by seven pillars.
And the seven pillars are set on the shoulders of a djinni whose strength is beyond thought.
And the djinni stands on an eagle... and the eagle on a bull, and the bull on a fish.
And the fish swims in the Sea of Eternity.
Where are we going?
On the highest peak of the highest mountain of the world... where earth meets the sky, and there is the Temple of the Dawn.
And in the great hall of the temple is the goddess of light.
And in the head of the goddess is the All-Seeing Eye.
And now, my little braggart... you can be a thief and a hero all in one.
A hero.

Get me out ofhere, quick! Quick!
Djinni! Djinni! Help! Help!
Djinni, help!
Djinni!
Is this the All-Seeing Eye?
Not for 2,000 years will she grow another.
For a hundred generations of men, she will not know their doings.
- Now shall I know what happened to Ahmad?
- Look.
Look hard.
It's true. It's Ahmad.
Help!
Help!
Help!
- Help!
- Help!
Now my second wish.
Take me to him.
To hear is to obey, little master of the world.
Hold tight, little brother.
We have to return half across the world.
Don't be afraid, Ahmad!
- It's me, Abu!
- Abu!
Put me down!
Put me down!
Gently, you clumsy good-for-nothing!
- Abu!
- Ahmad!
Allah be merciful.
It's a real djinni.
Yes. He's mine, and I am his master.
I am your master, aren't I?
To hear is to obey, O Master!
See? He brought me here, and he'll carry us away.
What's he laughing like that for?
I don't like the sound of it.
Oh, he's all right.
He's a bit big to talk to.
That's the worse part about him.
You have to shout so much.
Hey, you up there!
- What are you laughing for?
- For my freedom. It is at hand.
You get us out of this place.
- Your third wish?
- No, no, no, no.
Not yet.
He is big, but he is sharp.
I've got to be careful.
Only one wish left.
I have only one wish.
Oh, I know all about that.
Your princess.
If only I could see her again.
Is that all?
I don't need to waste a wish for that.
- Look.
- What's that?
Look into it - hard, hard.
Keep staring into it.
You'll see her.
It's true!
A blue rose?
I've heard about that.
That -
That's the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness.
If she inhales its fragrance, she'll forget... everything.
Blue roses?
Exquisite.
Who are you?
I don't know.
I've forgotten.
Why have you suffered?
Have I suffered?
I don't remember.
It seems I was in love.
Whom did you love?
I cannot tell.
I don't know any longer.
I can't look anymore!
There are worse things than blindness.
Knowledge can be more terrible than ignorance, if one can do nothing.
Nothing.
Why did you give me this?
Take it back and break it into a thousand pieces.
I only stole it to help you.
You stole it because you enjoy stealing.
Without my stealing, you'd be dead.
I wish I were dead.
I wish I'd never seen you.
I wish -
I wish I were in Bagdad.
I wish you were!
Ahmad! Ahmad!
Ahmad! Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Where are you?
Where you wished him - on his way to Bagdad.
Then take me out of this place.
Don't you hear? I want to get out.
You stay where you are.
You're a clever little man, little master of the universe... but mortals are weak and frail.
If their stomach speaks, they forget their brain.
If their brain speaks, they forget their hearts.
And if their hearts speak-
If their hearts speak, they forget everything!
Am I not your master?
No longer.
You've had your three wishes, and I am free!
Free!
Djinni! Djinni!
Come back!
Don't leave me here!
Don't let me die! Djinni!
And farewell, little master of the universe.
Farewell! Free!
Free! Free!
Everything of the past is forgotten.
You have been in love with me.
You are in love with me.
You will always love me.
Everything of the past is forgotten.
I have been in love with you.
I am in love with you.
I shall always love you.
Hey!
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
Jaffar!
Ahmad.
Let's go!
Put them in prison.
Chain them to opposite walls.
In the morning, they die the death of a thousand cuts.
I have failed, my love.
Forgive me.
I have no regrets.
We are together.
And shall be for the rest of our lives.
We shall never again know the torture of being apart.
And if death is not the end, we shall go on together.
Abu and I parted quarreling.
I wish I could tell him I'm sorry.
Abu, my friend... good-bye and forgive me.
No. I won't say good-bye.
I'll help.
But how? How?
If I can't help, I won't see!
Welcome, our prince.
Welcome, little prince.
Father of a beard, there's some mistake.
I'm not a prince.
I'm only a thief.
For you we have been waiting twice 2,000 years.
Oh, no. Not waiting for me... because I didn't know I was coming, and I don't know how I've come.
Who are you, father of miracles?
And where am I?
This is the Land of Legend... where everything is possible when seen through the eyes of youth.
We are the remnant of the Golden Age.
Golden because gold was nothing.
No more than the sand beneath your feet...
or the stone that we became.
How did you become stone?
We were petrified with horror... by the evil done among men... when they ceased to be children... and to believe in the beauty of the impossible.
But whenever the heart of a child
returns to us...
and comes into us... we live again.
And so, as that child... you are to be my successor.
Now, come with me... and I will present you with two insignia... of true kingship.
Here they are.
Aim this only at injustice, and you cannot fail.
Oh, no, father of kindness.
I don't want it.
I don't want to be a king.
- I only want to save my friend.
- Well, this will help you.
Take it. And now...
I do homage... for you are king... and all in our kingdom is yours... except that carpet, which I keep for myself.
For on that carpet... which flies when it is bidden -
"Fly, carpet" -
I shall go to paradise
at the hour appointed.
It is told,
though Allah is wiser or more merciful...
there was in the past of the ages
a king among kings...
a master of arms and of armies,
of vessels and auxiliaries.
And this master of time and people
was an oppressor to both...
until the earth was as pitch
on the faces ofhis subjects and his slaves...
and they groaned together in secret...
and were slayed in the marketplace.
But a wise man
among the sages of Bagdad...
comforted them
with a prophecy, saying...
"In the fullness of time,
a liberator shall come upon you...
and this shall be the sign ofhim."
O Allah,
I know you don't much like stealing.
I'll never steal again.
You can trust me.
Just this once more.Just this little carpet so as to get to Bagdad in time.
When the old king's hour comes... he won't want a carpet to fly to paradise.
Then you, O Allah, will take him by the hand... gentle and kind as he is... and lead him into eternal bliss.
Aren't I right?
But I must go to Bagdad to save my friend.
It's a question of minutes.
You must see that.
O Allah, lord ofjustice,
let me steal.
Fly, carpet.
Wait.
Fly, carpet!
Why do you close your eyes?
There's little time left to see him.
The people cried,
"We shall look for him in the clouds indeed...
"for if the great are powerless
to save us from this tyrant...
how can one of no account avail?"
And the reader
of the Milky Way replied...
"Have faith, trust in Allah...
"for there, one day in the blue,
you shall see a boy...
"the lowest of the low,
mounted on a cloud...
"and that cloud shall be as strong
as the hills beneath the snow...
"and from the ranges of the sky...
he shall destroy this tyrant
with the arrow ofjustice."
The horse!
Up, quickly!
Ahmad!
Jaffar!
My people,
I owe everything to Abu... and when he grows into a man, he shall be my grand vizier.
He shall be sent to the best school in Bagdad... and all the wise men of the East shall teach him all the wisdom of the world.
He shall be the wisest of men,
and in those future days... when he will be full of knowledge, science and dignity... he will be the shining example for the youths of Bagdad... and they may remember how the little thief became the dignifi -
Hey! Abu! Where are you going?
You've got what you wanted.
Now, I'm going to find what I want.
- What's that?
- Some fun.
- An adventure at last!
The doctor says the coffee is no good.
I made it the same as I always do.
It should be alright, then.
Things are a bit strained in there this evening.
What's it about this time?
─ Only the holiday.
He wants to go to Cornwall and she doesn't.
But darling, you're very fond of fish.
I may be. But I'm not fond of catching them.
Well there is no need for you to fish. You can just sit in the boat.
Exactly.
I can just sit in the boat.
I've been doing that for the past 5 years.
I'm sick and tired of sitting in a boat.
If you feel like that about it,
I'll go on my own.
Very well.
What?
I think perhaps a holiday apart might be a very good thing for both of us.
In other words you're off in search of a little adventure, all on your own.
If I were in search of that sort of adventure, I shouldn't go to Cornwall.
Well, you never know what you might find down there if you try.
Darling, because I want to go fishing and you don't?
I'm perfectly content to stay at home.
Very well.
Then I will have a bachelor holiday.
I think I might rather enjoy a bit of fishing.
Alone.
I suppose you think you're seeing things.
Yes, nurse.
Nurse?
You are a nurse, aren't you?
Do I look like a nurse?
No.
I must have hit my head as I went down.
I wish you wouldn't stare.
You're certainly not a nurse.
Who are you?
Miranda.
Miranda.
Where am I?
─ You're in my cave.
I brought you here.
You fell out of your boat.
Fell? I was pulled.
─ You're a rotten swimmer.
I may be a bit light headed, but to me you seem to have a ..
Tail?
─ Yes.
I have .. I'm a mermaid.
That doctor Martin is late.
─ Hmm.
He's had The Adventure out all day, ain't he George?
Hmm.
Are you going out to look for him?
─ No.
He knows what he's doing of.
I love tall men.
The last two I caught were so short
I had to throw them back again.
How do I get out of here?
That's the only way.
Oh that?
I could never do it.
You could if I helped you.
But I'm not going to.
Why not?
─ Because I'm lonely.
But you wouldn't dream of keeping me here.
Why, I'm a respectable married man.
Oh. So you've got a wife?
─ Yes.
Well there are plenty of men on land. She'll soon find another one.
How do you mean?
I'm thinking of keeping you here for myself.
You couldn't do that.
─ Oh, couldn't I?
There is a dreadful shortage of men below sea.
But I couldn't live here.
That's what they all think at first.
Do you mean to tell me that other men have lived here?
Several.
But not with me.
You are my first adventure.
Where did you get all these?
I picked them up mostly from ships.
So, you can read?
Of course.
I suppose you don't know what happened to Amber in chapter 18?
The same as happened in chapter 17, only twice.
Oh, I'm beginning to feel hungry.
You haven't got any food here, I suppose?
There you are.
That?
Oh, thank you.
Well.
Don't you eat fish?
Yes, but not raw.
And certainly not alive.
How funny you are.
Hey! Hey, where are you going?
Oh ..
I'm so happy.
Are you, Miranda?
I love the way you say Miranda.
Say it again.
Miranda.
Miranda.
Miranda.
You have the most beautiful knees.
What does it feel like to have two legs?
Oh, I find them quite useful.
What would my sisters say if they could see me now.
Yes. And what would my wife say if she could see me.
Is she as pretty as I am, Paul?
Hmm. She's quite attractive.
Then why did you leave her?
I haven't.
I'm having a week's holiday. That's all.
Oh .. are you?
But I'm going to keep you here.
Unless.
Unless what?
You take me on land with you.
On land?
You?
─ Yes, why not?
I've always wanted to go and this is my chance.
You're a doctor. You can take me as your invalid patient.
But ..?
Oh, my tail. You can wrap it up.
But you will have to buy me some clothes.
Some wonderful ones.
Where does your wife get hers?
Manell.
Oh yes.
I've seen some of his in Vogue.
They'll have to be specially long.
But what's wrong with that?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all.
I want to see all the sights.
I want to go to Buckingham
Palace and Billingsgate Market.
But most of all, I want to go to the opera.
It's out of the question.
What would people say?
I mean ..
How would I get you out of here?
Miranda, what would you eat?
Where would you sleep?
Miranda, please! Miranda!
Miranda.
Oh.
Alright.
[ Telephone ]
Yes?
You wish to speak to
Monsieur Manell personally?
Shall I tell him?
Oh yes, Dr Martin.
Long distance for you, Monsieur.
Dr Paul Martin from Cornwall.
Oh, how tiresome.
Manell here.
Dr Martin?
How charming of you.
Yes. Well, I'm ringing from the Anchor Hotel, Pendar.
Pendar.
Yes, I want three evening dresses.
Two day dresses.
And a what-you-call-it, a travelling coat.
I want you to make them a foot longer than usual.
And send them to me here.
Cornwall?
But Doctor Martin, without a fitting it is most irregular.
Dresses, they're very long for madame.
They will drag on the floor.
Very well, Dr Martin as a very special favour to you.
They will have to be from stock of course.
Oh yes, with any little alterations that madame should require.
Yes. Yes, they shall be sent out today or tomorrow at the latest.
The colours you leave to me?
Well.
I have one very chic dress of sea-green taffeta.
Clare, where are you?
Isobel, what's all this about?
─ A surprise. Look.
Isn't it wonderful?
─ Oh darling, it's lovely.
I'm so glad both for you and Nigel.
You're sweet. I simply had to tell you on my way out.
Oh, any news of Paul?
─ Yes, there is.
Considerable news.
─ What do you mean?
My dear, he's bringing a patient back with him from Cornwall.
To live here for three weeks.
What here, in this flat?
But Clare, who is it?
Oh, I don't know. Some old dear he met in Pendar.
She can't walk.
Oh darling, she'll never stop ringing for bottles.
I know. They are coming tonight.
Well, I suppose husbands on holiday could get into worst mischief.
Well, that's one thing I never have to worry about.
There.
Now we should be quite safe.
What would they do if they find out about me?
Oh I don't know. Probably put you in a peep-show I suppose.
Oh, how disgusting.
─ Hmm.
I remember I did see a mermaid once, in a glass case in ..
In Port Said. A pickled one.
Oh that must have been pour aunt Augusta.
Yes, she wasn't in the least like you.
She was very old.
─ And very pickled.
This all looks very nice, Betty.
─ Thank you.
Will the old lady be dining with you or here in her room tonight, madam?
Oh, in here I expect.
She is sure to be feeling tired after her journey.
I'm sorry about all this extra work.
─ Oh, I shall manage.
When is Charles going to meet the train?
─ I think he's just leaving.
[ Doorbell ]
Martin?
─ Yep.
Couple of cases. Sign here. Number 11.
Where are they?
Here, son.
Here. Martin. Two cases.
Number 11. Sign here.
Whatever is all this?
A barrel of oysters .. from Cornwall.
What's in this one?
Fish.
"Miss Trewella. Care of Martin."
Trewella? That must be the old lady's name.
Yes, I don't mind saying I'm against the whole thing. Turn the place upside down.
Billingsgate.
[ Door knocks ]
Yes?
May I have a word with you, madam?
─ Yes, Charles.
This old lady that's coming to stay, madam.
I hope I shan't be expected to wheel her about in a bath-chair.
Oh.
No, madam.
Very well, Charles. I will speak to the doctor about it.
Very good, madam.
Is this really London?
─ Yes.
But it looks so dirty.
It is a bit, isn't it. Look, Miranda.
I think I'd better go on first and have a talk with Clare.
What will I do?
─ My car will be here.
Charles will drive you round for a bit while I go on by taxi.
Charles?
─ Yes. He's my chauffeur.
Oh.
Evening, Betty.
─ Evening, sir.
Have a nice holiday?
─ What?
Oh yes. Yes I did, thank you.
Darling.
─ Paul.        ─ My sweet.
Oh you look wonderfully well.
Have you had a good time?
Magnificent.
─ Did you catch any big ones?
Rather. One whopper.
─ How big?
Big.
Well. Now that's over, suppose you start explaining?
Did you get my letter?
─ I did?
Where is Miss ..?
─ Trewella, dear.
I came by taxi and left her with Charles.
He's bringing her by a roundabout route.
She wanted to see Buckingham Palace.
─ Good heavens.
You don't really mind me bringing her here, do you Clare?
I suppose not.
She is by no means a straightforward case.
What actually is the matter with her?
Well I told you, dear.
She couldn't walk.
Her main trouble is a mental one.
Don't tell me she's a little dotty?
─ Far from it.
But you'll have to help me, Clare.
How?
Well, to begin with, the poor child ..
Child?
How old is she, Paul?
Quite young. Could be any age really.
Yes.
I had been picturing someone .. rather old.
Oh had you, dear? Why?
Oh, I don't know.
A bath-chair. Association of ideas, I suppose.
You were saying: the poor child?
Oh yes. Yes. She's met very few people.
In fact, she's had hardly any social life at all.
I see.
That explains Buckingham Palace.
She believes in starting at the top.
Buckingham Palace, Miss.
Oh stop, Charles. Please stop.
Look at that beautiful man.
Over there by the box.
Does he live here?
Him?
No, Miss .. he just works here.
You've got a nicer uniform, though.
Charles.
Are you married?
No, Miss. Just walking out.
Walking out of what?
Isn't she very pretty?
Well, you'll see for yourself, Miss.
She's Betty. She ..
She works at that flat.
Do you live at the flat, too?
Yes, Miss.
I shall like that.
I had to get her away from Cornwall.
She needs to be taken out of herself.
That, combined with a very special diet ..
Should put her on her feet again.
I'm afraid we can't quite hope for that.
Darling, her diet isn't going to be too difficult for Betty to cope with is it?
No, no. Quite simple.
Light, you know.
No meat, but .. fish.
Plenty of fish.
Paul, why couldn't she have gone to a nursing home?
Oh, that wouldn't suit
Miranda's case at all.
Miranda?
Yes.
A pretty name, isn't it.
Do you call her Miranda?
─ Yes.
She doesn't call you Paul by any chance?
As a matter of fact she does.
Really?
Well darling, it's business, You know.
There is one thing I absolutely insist on. You've got to get a nurse for her.
A nurse?
Yes.
I'll ring nurse Carey.
That's a very good idea.
For Carey?
I thought that was the one you were never going to use again.
No?
Nurse Carey is a bit eccentric, that's all. Might be a good thing in this case.
I give up.
Nurse Carey?
Doctor Martin.
Very well. And you?
Good.
Nurse .. are you on a case just now?
No, I'm not on a case just now, doctor.
I see.
I beg your pardon?
The birds are twittering so loudly.
Birds.
Yes. I can call round and see you tonight.
Yes, nurse.
You will .. you will live here, of course?
Oh, it will be for four weeks.
Four weeks?
I thought you said three?
─ Darling, please.
Darling.
No, nurse, that was Mrs ..
I beg your pardon?
Tonight. Yes.
Oh no, I can be round in two toots.
I was just having a quiet ..
I said, I was just having a quiet evening at home.
Am I heavy?
─ No, Miss.
Quite the opposite.
You are so strong, Charles.
I keep fit, Miss.
You have got such muscles.
I do a bit of rowing.
I suppose that's it.
Doesn't that give you a funny feeling?
Yes, Miss.
Good evening.
Good evening, Miss.
Tell the doctor I have taken Miss
Miranda to the bedroom, will you.
Are we going to your bedroom now, Charles?
Well ..?
Have you got to put me down?
No, Miss.
I've told you not to call me
"Miss" when we're alone.
Force of habit.
You've got such nice ears.
Have I?
─ Yes.
Nice and big.
My father always told me
I looked like a spaniel.
That's because you look so sad.
Well, it is sad.
That you can't walk.
I don't feel in the least sad.
I believe you like being carried.
─ I do.
I do.
Very much.
Charles.
You can put Miss Trewella down now.
Well.
A nice way to behave.
An "old lady" indeed. Not that you weren't enjoying yourself.
You know, it's a funny thing, but she's got such a cold ..
When you carry her.
Clare.
This is Miss Trewella.
Miranda.
How do you do.
─ How do you do.
You are very beautiful, aren't you.
Paul said you were just nice-looking.
Did he now?
─ Well ..
You must be feeling tired after your journey.
Oh no. I'm far too excited to be tired.
You're going to bed as soon as Nurse Carey gets here.
No I'm not. I feel wonderful.
You're going to be bed. I'm your doctor.
─ No.
Thank you. Dr Martin?
Is he expecting you, madam?
─ Yes. I'm nurse Carey.
Would you mind waiting in the study, please?
Certainly.
Well I think it is most unfair. I've always wanted to come to London.
Does that taste of anything?
Would you like to try?
No. I don't like fire so near my face.
Will it worry you if I do?
─ Not at all.
Do you always have to cook it or can you eat it raw?
Excuse me, sir. There is a nurse Carey to see you. She's in the study, sir.
Oh yes. I'd better see her right away.
Excuse me, will you.
I love Charles, don't you?
Now you've embarrassed him.
Did a box of fish arrive?
─ Yes, sir. Addressed to Miss Trewella.
Ah, then take into Miss Trewella's bathroom , will you.
The box of fish, sir?
─ Open it first, of course.
Of course, sir.
Of course?
Have you any family in Cornwall, Miranda?
Oh yes, there are dozens of us.
─ Dozens?
Yes. Some of them are rather nice.
But I've got one sister that I can't bear.
Fortunately she lives in the South Pacific.
So I don't have to see her very often.
No, I suppose not.
We used to sing good duets, though.
I have rather a nice voice, you know.
You know a lot about music?
─ No, practically nothing.
But I'd give anything to go to the opera.
Well, if Paul says you can we might make up a party and go. Tomorrow, perhaps.
How wonderful.
Then I can see all the people and they can see me and no-one will suspect.
Suspect what?
That I can't walk.
You see, nurse Carey.
This is a rather peculiar case.
But I thought it may be.
Seeing that it's so long since I had the pleasure of a case from you.
I am supposed to be "eccentric".
Is that the word?
How peculiar is this case, doctor?
Well, to start with, it must be treated with the utmost secrecy.
A woman?
Yes, nurse. A young woman.
─ Oh.
And how ill is this patient?
Well, in a manner of speaking, she isn't actually ill at all.
Oh, isn't she?
I see.
Goodnight.
No, no, nurse. It isn't that at all.
Please nurse, please.
You must believe me.
I am trusting you absolutely, nurse.
Very well.
I don't want to know anything you don't want to tell me, I'm sure.
You want a bath-chair, the patient is very peculiar.
No talking.
And I'm to be here at 10 o'clock.
Good day, Dr Martin.
Oh, let me see you to the door, nurse.
[ Telephone ]
Hello? Oh, Isobel.
No.
No, I don't think you'd better tonight.
What?
She's very different from what I expected.
I'll tell you tomorrow.
Yes, darling.
Is Nigel with you?
Give him my love.
Oh, he's wonderfully well.
Fishing always agrees with him.
Yes, he's caught quite a lot.
In fact the whole flat is full of fish.
Darling, I've got to go now. Goodbye.
Are you alright?
Well, I'm alright now.
But I think smoking is horrible.
How extraordinarily cold you are.
Am I?
Yes.
Terribly cold.
Who is Isobel?
She lives in the flat above.
She runs a hat shop.
Oh, I've never worn a hat.
And Nigel?
─ Her fiancée.
He's a painter.
─ Is he handsome?
Isobel thinks so.
─ Do you?
I just think Paul is.
So do I.
One moment.
Excuse me, darling. Do you mind?
Now Miranda, you can say goodnight. Bed.
Won't Clare mind?
Have I said the wrong thing?
"You are so strong, Charles."
"You have such muscles."
"I love your ears."
"Nice and big."
Do you think Clare likes me?
I'll find out.
What about the nurse, Paul?
─ I've picked one who won't say a thing.
No, no. You can't undress here.
Why not?
─ Well, never mind.
It's very odd.
Aren't you going to stay?
─ No, Miranda.
Say "Miranda" again.
─ Miranda.
Miranda. Miranda.
Lovely.
Goodnight.
[ Miranda singing ]
[ Miranda singing. Loud. ]
[ Miranda singing ]
Better hurry, darling. That nurse of yours will be here any minute.
I know.
Thank you, darling.
Did Miranda sleep well?
Well, apparently. She's very lively this morning, anyway.
And do we all go to the opera tonight?
─ Opera?
Yes, she's simply dying to.
I don't think it's a very good idea.
─ Oh, I do.                ─ You do?
Yes. After all, you've always said she needs taking out of herself.
We can borrow Mark's box at Covent Garden. He's away.
Yes. Yes, we could do that.
Have a look and see what we're doing tonight.
I can go up to Isobel's and ask her to come too, and she can bring Nigel.
Tonight .. "Rheingold".
Oh dear, I hate all those dreary mermaids.
Do you? Oh, do you, dear?
That must be nurse Carey.
Yes. Yes, I'd better see Miranda.
Tell Charles to bring the nurse to Miranda's room will you.
Oh .. Miranda.
Well, where are they, then?
─ I don't know.
Shan't be long, nurse.
Miranda, you mustn't do that.
What room is that?
That's the bathroom.
Oh, and it's .. it's full of fish.
Fish?
Miss Miranda.
Now let it go, girl.
Oh. Oh, good morning, nurse.
I was just preparing the patient.
That's what it sounded like.
Yes, well perhaps you'd like to see for yourself.
Yes.
Oh, nurse. I must tell you.
Miss Trewella sleeps .. in her bath.
Oh?
─ Yes.
Yes. In a bath full of cold water.
Well, everyone to their taste, I suppose.
Miranda.
This is nurse Carey.
Hello, nurse .. have an oyster.
Oh the pretty thing.
It's a mermaid.
I've always believed in them.
Oh doctor, this is delightful.
Now dear, hurry up and finish your breakfast.
Hello, darling.
─ Clare.
Well come on, tell me all about it.
There's plenty to tell you,
I can assure you.
The "old lady" has turned out to be very young and very pretty.
Darling, there is more to Paul than I thought.
Yes. Her name is Miranda Trewella.
And if you ask me, she's got Paul by the ears.
Darling, I can't wait to see her.
Well, you can see her tonight.
We're taking her to the opera.
Paul and I thought perhaps you and Nigel would like to come too?
I think we'd love to. What's on?
─ Rheingold.
Well, I'm not mad about opera myself, but Nigel is.
I'm going to watch Miranda working on your Paul.
Well, you won't be the only one watching, believe me.
What?
Raw fish sandwiches. Doctor's orders.
For you know who.
Yes.
The one you're so taken up with.
Miss Trewella.
That looks very nice, Betty.
These are the special ones for
Miss Trewella.     ─ Thank you.
Madam .. about that matter of the bath-chair?
Oh yes, Charles. I've spoken to the doctor about it.
It's alright, you needn't wheel it out.
Well, I've changed my mind, madam.
Have you?
I shall be very pleased to wheel the young lady out, madam.
And now that I've seen her.
Well .. I feel ..
You feel what, Charles?
Sorry for her, madam.
I'll tell her, Charles.
I wish you would, madam.
My great grandmother visited land when she was a girl.
She sang at St Anna church.
─ Mind that thermometer.
She was rather naughty, though.
There was a choirboy called Matthew Trewella.
I see.
What does it say?
─ Nicely below normal.
Are you married, nurse Carey?
My husband died ten years ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
─ I was very glad.
Oh?
Men are fickle creatures.
─ Oh, I love them.
Excuse me, Miss Miranda.
Don't you find your tail rather a ..
Handicap with the gentlemen?
Oh no.
It provides what you might call an "element of surprise".
I shouldn't wonder.
There are the others.
Miss Lambert and Mr Hood please, madam.
Clare.
─ Hello, darling.
Nigel, this is the first chance
I've had to congratulate you.
Thank you.
─ Hello, Nigel.
Come and get a drink.
─ Fine.
Where is she?
Darling, she won't be a moment.
She's got to be dressed.
Nigel ought to be dressed, too.
Oh, it suits him to be untidy.
But it doesn't suit me.
Just look at that tie.
Alright?
Yes, very nice.
─ Cheers.
Good luck.
Tell me, Paul.
What's this about your new patient?
It sounds very interesting.
─ What does?
This .. psychological cure you're doing.
Isobel told me about it.
Of course, she was rather flippant.
She very often is, you know.
Oh. What did she say?
She said the treatment was all fish and faith.
Excuse me.
Oh dear, you must have got hold of one of Miranda's specials.
Ha ha. That's the fish part of the cure, Nigel.
Charles, I'll take her.
I can manage, sir.
─ I'll take her, Charles.
Well, I could manage, sir.
Miranda .. this is Isobel.
You were the one that sells hats?
Yes. How do you do?
And is this Nigel, your boyfriend?
Yes, he sells paintings.
─ How do you do.
He's beautiful.
Are you allowed to drink, Miranda?
A glass of salt water, please.
A what?
A glass of salt water.
I say, that's a funny thing to drink.
But .. doctor's orders.
Well, I'd better ring for Charles.
[ Buzzer ]
She wears the most beautiful dress I've ever seen.
That's nice.
You must be somebody like her to get away with it though.
If you're like her you can get away with anything, it seems to me.
What?
[ Buzzer ]
Aren't you ever going to answer that bell?
Or do you want me to carry you in, Charles, darling?
How about a sandwich?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
You really liked that?
It's lovely. Why?
Well .. oh nothing, no.
You rang, sir?
─ Ah, Charles.
Bring Miss Trewella a glass of salt water.
Yes, sir.
Salt water, sir?
─ About a heaped dessert spoonful.
Very good, sir.
If I get a mouthful of salt water when I'm bathing ..
I'm practically sick on the spot.
Do you like the sea?
─ I love it.
So do I.
Well, I must say she has the most repellent manners.
Well they don't seem to repel everyone, apparently.
She's got some nice clothes, too.
Yes, I've been noticing them.
Salt water, sir.
─ Thank you, Charles.
You can go and get the car now.
Yes, sir.
Try some of this cocktail.
Oh, horrid.
Your salt water, Miranda.
Lovely.
I'll get you a drink, Nigel.
Is the drink alright, darling?
Do have another sandwich.
Oh Isobel, could I be a customer of yours?
Why yes, I suppose so.
I'd love to have a hat like that.
I don't wear one as a rule.
You look as though you always shopped in Paris.
Well it is surprising what you can find in Cornwall if you try.
You are not going to tell me that dress came off the peg in Pendar's stores?
This dress?
Why, no.
I ran it up myself.
I say, that's very clever of you, Miranda.
I wish Isobel could do a thing like that.
Yes, well I think we should be getting along.
Are we all set?
─ Why yes, Paul.
I think that would be a good idea.
Come along, darling.
Well, I'll carry you down, Miranda.
─ No, no. That's alright.
You would probably drop her.
─ Now don't be absurd.
I won't drop her.
I know exactly how to lift her.
─ Now look here.
Excuse me, sir.
Why, Charles. How nice of you.
Well, she's certainly a man's woman.
You know, there's something about that dress ..
It came from Manell, of course.
Yes.
I must pay Manell a visit tomorrow.
She's incredibly pretty.
She is pretty incredible.
Nurse.
Yes?
Have a sandwich, nurse.
They've got to be eaten up.
Oh, thank you.
I do feel rather peckish.
Miss Trewella is very different from what we were expecting.
I'm sure she is.
What's her trouble?
Paraplegia, perhaps.
Or maybe poliomyelitis.
Sounds awful.
It is an extraordinary case.
Do you think the doctor can cure her?
I wouldn't dare venture an opinion.
She is very pretty.
Enchanting.
Have another sandwich, nurse.
─ Oh, thanks.
I enjoy my food.
Are you .. are you really enjoying it, Miranda?
Oh yes.
I'm frightfully hot.
I can't wait for the drinks.
Me too.
─ What about you, Miranda?
Nigel, would you mind going ..
No, you go and have drink.
I'll wait here with Miranda.
But ..
─ Come along, darling.
Alright.
I'll bring you something back, Miranda.
Nigel.
─ Hmm?
I think you're very nice.
Do you?
You don't know me very well.
Oh yes I do.
Well how could you, after such a short time?
Knowing some people is a matter of instinct.
How long have you and
Isobel been engaged?
Exactly three days.
But it's taken me three years to talk her into it.
How could she resist you?
There is something about your face.
That makes me want to cry.
Oh yes. Yes, I often feel that way about it myself.
Such nice hands.
I'd .. I'd have known you were an artist.
Would you paint me?
Oh yes, I'd like to.
I'd like to very much.
─ Oh, would you?
Yes .. only ..
Would you mind not mentioning it to Isobel.
Oh, of course.
It will be a secret between you and me.
─ Yes.
Ooh!
What is it, dear?
─ Cockles.
Oh no, we can't.
─ Oh yes we can.
Come on, Miss. Make way for the lady.
─ Excuse me.
Yes, sweetie?
─ Two pints, please.
Two pints? You going to have a party?
─ No, just a snack.
You're a girl after my own heart.
Darling, you can't do this.
I've never touched a cockle in my life.
─ Why not?
I couldn't.
If you ask me, I don't think they're respectable.
I know winkles aren't.
Here.
Stop .. stop! You must stop.
Oh Miss. Let her have her fling.
She likes her cockles, same as me.
Quite right. More please.
Yes. Give her some more.
─ Yes.
I'd like to stand you cockles all round.
Come on, there. Here you are.
Here's some for you.
─ Have some vinegar.
I don't think the doctor would approve of this at all.
There's no harm in me having my portrait painted.
I don't know.
When I was sixteen I sat for a sculptor.
Only I wasn't exactly sitting.
He thinks we've gone to the museum.
Precisely. And I don't like deceiving him.
Mister Nigel Hood?
Oh yes. I'll call him.
Mister Hood!
There is no need for you to deceive the doctor.
You're quite right. I will keep my word.
I'll go to the museum.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh yes, yes.
Anything you want to know?
─ Oh, yes.
I was interested in the bandaging, young man.
Bandaging?
Look at the way that's put on. It's all wrong.
It's bound to slip in time.
Well, it's been there two thousand years.
Well it wouldn't satisfy the matron where I was trained.
Nigel.
─ Uhuh?
Who is that?
Oh, just a model.
I'm sure it is very like her.
You know, as a matter of fact it is.
Doesn't Isobel mind you doing things like that?
Oh, she doesn't see eye-to-eye with my painting at all.
She'd rather I designed posters and made a lot of money.
How are you going to paint me?
─ Ah, like ..
Like Venus rising out of the sea.
No.
Why did you say that?
I don't know.
I just see it that way.
Well, I don't want to be painted like Venus.
I don't want the sea in the picture at all.
Oh .. oh, alright.
Very well, Miranda.
I love the way you say Miranda.
Say it again.
Miranda.
Miranda.
Miranda.
Good gracious.
I've got pins and needles in my ..
What's that?
I've got pins and needles.
Oh. Well then, we'll stop.
Isobel is very lucky.
She doesn't seem think so.
I'm inclined to agree with her.
Nigel.
Did you ring, madam?
Yes. I want Charles.
Wouldn't I do, madam?
─ Not for what I want.
Charles.
Good morning, Miss.
Come in.
Close the door.
Are you busy today?
Well, Miss ..
I thought you might drive me to the zoo.
Where is Miss Trewella?
─ Out.             ─ Out?
But how?
─ Where have you been?
Well, I just nipped round the corner to my little cubbyhole. To feed my birds.
Well, the bird here has flown for the day.
Betty, where on earth is
Charles? And the car?
I must have it.
What are you thinking about?
Things I ..
Shouldn't be thinking, mainly.
About me?
Yes.
I'm afraid I'm getting very fond of you, Charles.
Well, I like you very much, too.
I think you are ..
Very pretty and ..
Cool and ..
Awfully cool.
I think we'd better be getting back.
─ Getting back?
It's 4 o'clock and they'll want ..
─ But I'm just getting to know you.
They'll be wanting the car and ..
Mr Manell, Mrs Martin is here.
─ I don't want to see anyone.
Good afternoon.
─ Oh my dear Mrs Martin.
This is wonderful. Do come in. I am absolutely distracted but distracted.
Did you like the dresses
I sent to Cornwall?
Not altogether.
─ Oh ..
Well it was such a rush and your husband gave such peculiar instructions.
My husband?
Oh but yes, of course.
He telephoned me from Cornwall.
Did he enjoy his holiday?
Oh yes, I should think never a dull moment.
If I thought that you were in league with Paul, I would ..
Mrs Martin, I forbid you to upset me.
You must go away.
Miss Brown, don't just stand there.
Bam .. bam .. bam ..
Bam .. bam .. bam ..
Bam .. bam .. bam ..
If that car ..
Alright, you start.
Darling, you've simply got to do something about Miranda.
I can't have Betty upset and Charles kidnapped.
But I've had to walk and run about all day for taxis. Do you think I want it?
Well then, you've got to put a stop to it.
Then there is another thing.
I've been having a little talk to Manell.
Manell? Oh ..
How is he?
Why did you buy the clothes for Miranda?
What are you up to?
I'm not up to anything.
Well, Miranda didn't have any clothes.
I take it she was running around naked down there?
You know Miranda can't run.
Well, if you ask me there is something very fishy about this case.
Clare.
Clare, I wish you'd trust me about this.
I do.
But I'm watching you as well.
Darling.
Shall I leave it here?
─ Yes.
Nurse.
─ Yes, dear?
You've been married.
Oh yes, love.
And when you were married, did you want to kill him?
Oh yes, dear. That's only normal.
You look a bit off colour.
I think I'll give you a hand with these things.
I was going to marry Charles.
But I don't know now.
Well.
He's been acting funny lately.
Funny, love? How?
Well, whenever I go near him or hold his hand or anything he ..
Says I'm hot.
Hot dear?
Yes, says I'm not cold enough.
That's the first time I've ever heard that as a complaint.
He used to be quite the reverse.
Well, I expect it comes from driving a motorcar.
I always think that makes men unnatural.
Any tea left?
Are your ears burning, young man?
My ears?
Evening, Charles.
─ Evening, sir.
Is Mrs Martin home?
No sir, she has gone to the cocktail party.
Charles, you can have the evening off.
Well, I was driving you and
Miss Trewella to the party, sir.
I'll drive her.
No, sir. That's quite alright, sir.
I said, have the evening off.
I'll drive her.
Won't Clare mind our not going to the party?
Oh, I called up.
I said I couldn't go because I had promised to take you to the theatre.
And when you tell her that we didn't go to the theatre ..
I won't tell her.
Oh Paul, look. A pool.
Can we stop?
Can we sit on the bank?
─ Hmm.
I've missed you, Paul.
─ Have you, Miranda?
Isn't it lovely to be alone again?
Well?
Unzip me, Paul.
Oh.
Certainly not.
But I will die if I .. if I don't get in the water.
Somebody might .. see you.
Does that matter?
It's heaven.
Come in and get me.
─ Just coming.
You're terribly late.
Oh, Clare. There you are.
I was hoping not to wake you.
I gathered that.
It was all my fault, Clare.
We .. went for a spin.
Is it raining?
─ Raining? No.
I only wondered.
Well, I'll just take Miranda along to her room.
Goodnight, Clare.
Darling.
It's very flattering, Nigel.
It's far from doing you justice.
You make me forget Isobel.
Nigel.
Hmm?
I'm going away soon.
Oh .. Miranda.
But I've got a present for you.
There.
Oh .. oh, thank you.
Thank you, Miranda.
What is it?
It's a lock of my hair.
A lock of your hair?
Yes. You wear it round your neck.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Miranda.
But .. couldn't I just keep it in my pocket?
My .. my breast pocket.
No.
It's a token.
A token of ..?
Of what?
Of a love.
That might have been.
Darling, are you still angry with me?
Of course not. I told you,
I've got a headache.
If ..
If Miranda wants to come out tonight, I'd ..
I'd like you to come too.
No, Paul. Not tonight.
Oh, Clare. Please.
No. I'm going to lie down.
There is no reason why you shouldn't take Miranda out.
Is there?
No.
If you .. if you say so.
The doctor has been asking what attracts you so much to the museum.
What did you say?
I passed it off.
You are a dear.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Well, it's a case of what you do in spite of me.
Still, I was young once.
At hospital dances I used to do the gallop with the house surgeon.
And one year I danced a Mazurka.
A solo.
I can't very well do that.
It's a foreign sort of dance, the Mazurka. But very graceful.
[ Singing: ]
"Ta da da da .."
Doctor! You made me jump.
Was that it, nurse?
Well really, I think ..
Oh dear, oh dear.
Paul.
─ Hmm?
Does Clare know about me yet?
No, of course not.
Well, it won't be long before she does.
Oh, we'll keep the secret.
I can't help thinking about aunt
Augusta and what they did to her.
Paul.
─ Uhuh.
It's the opera again tonight.
Will you take me there?
Oh, it means I'll have to change again.
Paul, please take me for a special reason. Will you?
Alright.
Whatever is this?
They're for you because you are such a dear to me.
I want you to have them now.
But my dear ..
─ I dived for them myself.
Then they are real pearls?
But I can't.
Oh, Miss Miranda.
I've never had a present like this in all my life.
I'm so happy.
Thank you.
Why .. why, Isobel.
What's up?
─ What's up?
Are you surprised to see me?
Oh no .. no, no. Of course not. No.
Well, aren't you going to ask me up?
Yes, yes. Of course.
Isn't this a little bit late for you to be coming here?
I just thought I'd come out and see you.
Oh.
What on earth are you cooking?
Oh .. my supper.
It smells terrible.
What have you got there, Nigel?
Oh, it's nothing, nothing. Just something I've been working on.
May I see?
─ No. I'd rather you didn't.
Oh Nigel. And you're always saying
I don't take any interest in your work.
Yes. Well ..
Oh, alright then.
Miranda.
So this is where she goes on her sightseeing tour.
I know that you don't like her.
I don't dislike her, but I think she is rather peculiar.
If you don't see eye-to-eye with people.
You always think they are peculiar.
Why, you even think I'm eccentric.
You've told me so for years.
"Get your hair cut, Nigel.
Straighten your tie, Nigel."
"You can't wear sandals, Nigel."
Talking like that, I think you are odd in the head.
There you are! I've bats in my head now, have I?
Well, I'm glad I have.
If you don't like me as I am, you can ..
You can do the other thing.
Are you trying to quarrel with me?
Now, what have I done? What have I said?
It's the accumulation of what you've been doing and saying for the past 3 years.
It's taken you long enough to find out about it.        ─ Far too long.
I know now. We're utterly unsuited to each other.
Oh .. so that's it.
It's this wretched Mona Lisa you've been painting.
Now you leave her out of it.
─ Well it is, isn't it.
Oh, I wasn't born yesterday.
It's a pity you can't throw it at me.
You never thought it was good enough.
─ Oh!
You and Miranda!
Now look what you've done.
It's like I said.
Better to find out our mistakes now.
Instead of later.
You don't know what you're saying.
You're not even the same person anymore.
Well, I'm not deceiving you anyway.
Not now, you're not.
Because I found out about you.
I know.
And I'm sorry about it.
But it's just that.
Well.
This is something stronger than me.
Why Betty, whatever is the matter?
It's Charles, madam.
Our engagement is off.
Oh, Betty.
All on account of Miss Trewella.
─ What?
Things have been going on between them.
─ What sort of things?
I don't know, but he's wearing her love-token.
A love-token?
Yes. A lock of her hair made into a sort of pendant.
Do you mean to tell me that Charles is actually wearing a pendant?
Yes, madam.
─ Around his neck?
Where else could he wear it?
He says she wants looking after.
I reckon she does, too.
What do you mean?
─ Well.
If you'll forgive my saying so,
I think she a bit funny in the head.
For one thing, I think she sleeps the whole night through in a cold bath.
She what?
Yes, I can see the water being run in at night and let out again in the morning.
And the other morning when I cleaned out the bath I found a bit of seaweed in it.
Very peculiar.
And then there is another thing about her that isn't quite nice.
She never wears any panties.
Never wears panties?
─ No.
Plenty of other underclothes she has, but not a single pair of those.
I think there is something fishy about Miss Trewella.
"M."
"M-e."
"M-e-r."
"Mermaid!"
"A mythical creature, half woman, half fish."
All these lovely dresses.
All the lights.
I wish I could stay here forever.
I'm afraid it's impossible, Miranda.
Yes.
Could you get me a glass of water before it starts again?
I'll try.
[ Miranda singing: ]
[ Miranda singing: ]
[ Miranda singing: ]
[ Miranda singing: ]
[ Miranda singing: ]
Now I can say I've sung in Covent Garden.
Yes.
Good evening. I want to see Miss Trewella, please.
Nigel.
Is anything the matter?
─ Is Miranda here?
No, I'm afraid she's out.
Oh, I .. I see.
Clare .. Isobel and I. We've packed up.
Because of Miranda?
You know?
It's an epidemic.
─ What do you mean?
Oh, nothing.
I guessed you'd been seeing her. That's all.
I think you're making a frightful mistake.
The fact that she's an invalid makes absolutely no difference to me.
Well, I admit she's very fascinating.
Have you asked her to marry you?
No .. I haven't been in a position to ask her yet, but ..
I've hinted at it, though.
She hasn't said "yes" by any slip of the tongue?
No, but I think she might.
About Miranda's legs.
I've already told you, it makes absolutely no difference.
No, no, no. You misunderstand me.
Her legs, Nigel.
What are they like?
Well really, I haven't the slightest idea.
I'm surprised that you could ever ask me such a question.
[ Doorbell ]
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to call so late, madam.
─ Come in, Charles.
Well, I used the front door because ..
You didn't want to run into Betty.
Yes, madam.
I want to see Miss Trewella, madam.
─ Oh, I'm afraid she's out, Charles.
Well.
Would you mind if I waited in the hall?
I want to see her rather urgently.
Nonsense, Charles. Come in and wait in the sitting-room.
Well, I gather that your call is a social one. Come on in.
Did I hear you say that you are wanting to see Miss Trewella?
That's right, sir.
─ Oh.
Is she expecting you?
Well, no sir. It's in the nature of a surprise.
Oh, I see. Oh.
I am .. I'm waiting to see her myself.
Is she expecting you, sir?
No, no.
Two surprises.
Is it asking too much for you to put off seeing Miss Trewella until the morning?
I'm afraid it would, sir.
But you can't wait here to see her now.
Yes, sir. Under the circumstances, I can.
I'm going to ask Miss
Trewella to be my wife.
What?
Your wife?
─ Yes, sir.
Unless I've mistaken the signs, I rather think her answer is going to be "Yes".
Oh .. oh, do you?
Oh, how extraordinary.
It may interest you, but that's exactly what I'll ask Miss Trewella myself.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid you don't stand a chance.
Well, you see sir, she likes the practical type of man.
Like myself, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
It's a fact she hates the practical type of man and efficiency and all that rot.
She told me.
─ Perhaps, sir.
I'm afraid you've got it all wrong. She told me.
Oh, Charles. Charles, I'm sorry. I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment.
You see, actions count for more than words.
That's alright, sir.
Charles.
Did she tell you it was a token of love which ..
Which might have been, sir?
As a matter of fact, she did.
Well, what will you two men be up to next?
Sugar, Charles?
─ No thank you, madam.
Nigel?
I must be getting along, madam.
─ Yes, I won't wait either.
But .. well, she'll be back any moment.
Could I .. could I have an envelope?
Yes, of course.
There is one in the study.
Would you mind returning this to Miss Trewella, madam?
Delighted to, Charles.
Thank you, madam.
Charles.
─ Yes, madam?
There is another thing, if you'll excuse my asking.
Miss Trewella's legs.
What are they like?
Madam?.
Oh surely you know.
Certainly not, madam. I ..
I hope I always behaved like a gentleman.
You'd be surprised at some gentlemen, Charles.
Yes, madam.
Ah, I think I'll go and have a word with Betty, madam.
Good luck.
Oh, thank you, madam.
[ Doorbell ]
It's alright, Charles. I'll go.
Oh come in, my dear.
Clare, Nigel and I have had the most awful row and broken off our engagement.
Yes, I know.
─ You know?
Then you know it's because of Miranda?
Yes my dear, I do. I know everything.
Oh, what a fool I've been.
It was a good portrait, too.
The best he's done.
Oh, I must have been crazy to destroy it.
Now, he'll just start all over again.
Oh, I don't think he will somehow.
I do love him.
I love him terribly.
Isn't that silly of me.
Yes, it is.
It's all my fault. If it wasn't for the shop we'd have been married years ago.
Oh Nigel, that was mean of you.
I'm sorry about the portrait.
That's alright.
I'm going to turn it into a sunset.
Are you sure she's really seen it?
─ Quite.
In future, I'd better stick to still life.
Here are my keys. Take them and do what you like to every hat in the place.
Isobel ..
─ Please take them.
It still won't come off.
It doesn't have to, does it?
Look, do you mind going upstairs?
I'm terribly sorry but I'll explain it all to you tomorrow.
Oh well.
Alright.
Hello.
Hello, Clare.
─ Hello, Clare.
How is the head?
─ Oh, gone entirely.
Have you had a good time?
It's been a wonderful evening.
What are you doing?
Oh, only the crossword.
─ But you hate them.
Oh, just killing time, you know.
Unfortunately, I got stuck.
What do you want to know?
A seven letter word beginning with "M".
A creature of the species "Manatee".
Manatee.
All it says here is "an aquatic mammal".
"A mythical creature half-woman, half fish."
"A sea cow."
A sea-cow?
─ Miranda.
She knows .. she's been spying on me.
You're not going to call me a sea-cow and get away with it.
Then you ..
Really are a ..
─ Yes.
Miranda is .. a mermaid.
But if you think you're going to take a peek at my tail, you're much mistaken.
Am I awake?
Now she thinks I'm a nightmare.
I'm hot.
I want a glass of water.
Very well.
You've hated me ever since
I set tail in this house.
No, I ..
Phew.
Is there anything I can do, doctor?
─ No, she's a little over-tired, is all.
Nurse Carey will be back any moment.
─ When she is, tell her to go to .. bed.
You can all go to bed.
I don't want her to be disturbed.
I ..
I wonder what's upset her.
─ I should have thought you would know.
Oh Betty.
No, you can't drop me one moment then pick me up the next.
But all I want is a little warmth and comfort.
Warmth?
The trouble with you is you don't know what you do want.
Well, I've failed.
I'm just a fish out of water.
You haven't failed, Miranda. You've already had two visitors tonight.
Nigel and Charles.
What did they want?
Well, I think they both wanted to marry you.
Both of them?
Isn't it absurd?
Were they here together?
Yes.
I shall never be able to face them again.
They asked me to return these to you.
My tokens.
How funny human-beings are about presents.
Paul!
Oh .. Paul.
My dear, it's a wonder you've any hair left.
They are only made from combings.
Well, aren't there any men under the sea who you could give them to?
Oh yes, a few.
But they have little eyes and flat noses. Most unattractive.
That's why we're practically extinct.
Clare.
You can see my tail if you want to.
Oh.
Sometime, perhaps.
It's quite pretty when it's wet, isn't it, Paul.
Oh charming. Perfectly charming.
Have you met any of Miranda's sisters?
─ No. No.
They're at Majorca until the spring.
I'm going there too.
I want to be somewhere lovely in May.
I'll lie in my bath now.
Give me a few minutes, Clare. And then you can come through and see my tail.
By then, it will be a little less dehydrated looking.
Put me in my chair, Paul.
Now I can manage.
─ You're quite sure?
Kiss me, Paul.
Now you'd better go back to Clare.
Yes.
Sorry she found out about me.
It doesn't matter.
Well darling, that's settled then.
I feel much happier now you know it.
But we can't keep this to ourselves.
Darling, we must.
Paul, it is our duty to make it public.
No, Clare
It wouldn't be fair to Miranda.
But Paul ..
No, I promised Miranda it would be a secret, and I'll not go back on my word.
Paul.            ─ Huh?
─ Her tail.
Is it very odd?
Not really, just like ..
Oh .. they've gone have they?
Just a snack, dear.
Would you like me to come in with you?
─ Certainly not.
Miranda.
Miranda?
Paul!
She's gone.
─ What?
Gone. And her chair has gone, too.
There she is.
Miranda, come back! Wait!
Miranda!
Quickly, Paul.
Miranda!
Stop, Miranda!
Come back!
Oh Paul.
─ She's gone.
Will she be alright?
─ Hmm.
I've seen her swim. She'll be alright once she makes the open sea.
Maybe it's just as well.
Next year I'm going to come fishing with you.
I don't think I shall want to go fishing ñext year.
No more bachelor holidays?
Never again.
Poor Miranda.
She'll be happy basking in the sunshine in Majorça.
Oh yes, Majorça.
I wonder why she säid she wanted to be somewhere lovely in May.
I wonder.

Princess Iron Fan
Journey to the West is a wonderful children's story, but the world often misunderstands it as a fantasy novel.
This film was made for the purpose of training the hearts and minds of children.
The story is pure, untainted by fantasy.
Fiery Mountain blocking the path of Tang Seng's company is a metaphor for the difficulties in life.
In order to overcome them, one must keep faith.
Everybody must work together in order to obtain the palm leaf fan and put out the flames.
Tripikata True Sutra
It's already autumn, how can it still be so warm?
Fool, don't talk rubbish. We should hurry and get on our way.
Wukong, where is this place?
We must pass through here to continue westwards, that much is certain.
Might we have taken the wrong path?
Why is it so hot here?
Master, look!
Isn't that a house up ahead?
Let's go in and rest for a while, OK?
This place is called Fiery Mountain.
The fire stretches for hundreds of miles.
Not single straw of grass can grow here.
The four seasons of the year are all warm.
You couldn't pass through the mountain even with a head of copper and arms of iron.
What kind of place is this? Master, don't worry!
The three of us are all strong enough to pass!
Master, I'll go and have a look!
Wukong, what was it like?
Bad, bad, very bad.
If I were any slower the fur on my tail would have been burned off.
Noble host, the fires here are so big.
How can you grow any crops?
A thousand miles from here lives Princess Iron Fan.
She has a palm leaf fan.
Wave the fan once and the fire goes out.
Twice and the wind starts blowing.
Three times and the rain starts coming down.
In the following period we plant and harvest.
However, asking that princess to come is certainly no simple matter.
Where does she live?
She lives in Palm Leaf Cave at Emerald Cloud Mountain.
Does she live there alone?
Doesn't she have a husband?
Her husband is Bull Demon King.
What, her husband is Old Bull?
Fool, you know him? Come with me to borrow the fan!
Actually... Old Bull doesn't live there.
Looking for his woman when he isn't home isn't very... appropriate.
You... you... the two of you go.
I... I'll stay here and serve Master.
Sha Wujing, go with your two fellow apprentices.
Palm Leaf Cave
Fool, I always go first.
This time it's your turn!
Junior! I always go first, this time it's your turn!
Senior...
I'm asking you to make a small effort for Master. Can't you do that?
Hurry up!
Simple monk, where did you come from?
The Great Sage... Tang Seng... wants your princess...
Nonsense!
Senior... why don't you go instead?
Fool, you go!
Senior, why don't you go?
Lazy fool!
Great God of Thunder! Don't kill me, let me go!
Go tell your princess that Sun Wukong has come to borrow the fan.
Yes, yes! Let me loose, I'll go at once.
Grandma, there's a Sun Wukong outside asking to borrow the fan.
Quickly fetch my sword.
Sun Wukong, you hurt my son!
You dare come here to meet your death?
I've never met you before, how could I have harmed your son?
My son Red Child's life was ruined, wasn't that your doing?
Your son is with the Goddess of Mercy now, how can you say that I hurt him?
Enough rubbish! Come here and let me chop you with my sword.
If you can take it I'll lend you the fan.
Really?
Stop! Quickly give me the fan!
Great Sage, weren't you going west? Why have you come back here?
Princess Iron Fan blew me here with a single wave of her fan.
That's truly amazing, Great Sage. I have something for you.
This is a wind pearl. When you use it, your heart will become steady as a rock.
Princess Iron Fan won't be able to move you.
Great Sage, come and have a look.
Thank you.
Senior... where... where has he... been blown to?
Who cares about him? Let the monkey handle himself. Let's go.
Senior... senior...
You... you...
Where were you blown to by that old lady?
Fool, now it's definitely your turn to go.
I'm not going, a single wave of her fan could blow me to some faraway land.
Maybe it's better if you go again.
I won't go.
Next time I won't let you off!
This time I won't move no matter how much you wave, as sure as I call myself am a man!
Senior, how come this time her fan couldn't move you?
Let's break our way in.
Quickly bring out the fan for Sun Wukong!
Sun Wukong, where are you?
I'm in your stomach!
Sun Wukong, spare me!
Only if you give me the fan!
I promise, I'll give it to you. Please come out!
Hurry up and bring the fan.
We've brought out the fan.
Why haven't you come out?
Open your mouth and I'll come out.
Sun Wukong, why haven't you come out?
Here I am. Lend me the fan for a while, I'll return it.
Master has been waiting long enough, let's get going!
Scripture, what is scripture?
Scriptures are the principles that link heaven and earth.
They are the principles of man.
Only he who holds these principles can rid himself of pain and live a good life, live a true and honest life.
Conversely, he who does not know these principles, will live a life full of misery.
Even his son or grandson will not achieve happiness.
Why am I going to get the scripture?
Because men nowadays are trapped in misery.
In order to achieve this goal, we are going to appear before the Tang emperor and discuss this very complicated matter.
Did you get the palm leaf fan?
We have it.
Is this it?
Noble hosts, now that we have the fan, we will take our leave.
Hold on.
Everyone, I would like to ask Sage Seng to stay here for a few more days.
Do you agree?
Agreed!
Thank you for your kindness.
But the sooner I leave the sooner we can complete our task.
Very well, will the honorable apprentice first go to Fiery Mountain.
After extinguishing the flames, continue to follow Sage Seng.
All right, go ahead!
Princess Iron Fan is really despicable, she gave us a fake fan!
I'll kill her for sure!
No, killing her is the wrong thing to do.
I won't let you kill anyone.
Let's think of something else.
Senior, how could you be fooled by her?
After making such an effort all we got was a fake fan.
Ridiculous, ridiculous.
Then you go!
OK, I'll go, I'll go, I'm going!
I'll go find Bull Demon King.
This is a good solution.
Partner, what do you think?
We'll see how you do.
What do you think, am I pretty today?
Beautiful, my baby.
Accompany me for a walk outside the cave, all right?
My baby, why don't you go by yourself.
Why of course, I'm just a plain country girl.
Taking me outside might cause you to lose face.
Baby, what are you saying?
You go ahead, I'll come out in a while, all right?
Emerald Cloud Cave
Goddess, you're truly an angel come down from heaven.
Who... who are you?
I've come from Palm Leaf Cave to look for Bull Demon King.
Let go of me!
Goddess, slow down!
Emerald Cloud Cave
Baby, who has bullied you?
You!
How could I bully you?
Why don't you go back to Palm Leaf Cave?
It would spare you some embarrassment.
They often send people to look for you, and bully me.
Has there been someone here to look for me?
There's a pig monk outside looking for you.
He almost scared me to death.
How can this be? Wait while I go out to have a look.
Bull, old friend!
There's a very beautiful young lady in here.
Hey, that's my woman! Why have you come to bother her?
Oh, I didn't know, please forgive me!
You didn't know, so I can't blame you. Off you go!
No, no. I still have something I need you to help me with.
We were on our way to retrieve the scriptures when we arrived at Fiery Mountain.
Please ask your wife to lend us the palm leaf fan for a while.
Absolutely not! Tang Seng and Sun Wukong are my son's enemies.
I'd love to take my revenge on them.
Your son is with the Goddess of Mercy now, please don't fight.
All right, since we are old friends, I won't fight you.
Now go away!
Baby, that pig monk is a friend of mine.
He wasn't sent from Palm Leaf Cave at all.
I don't believe you.
I'm not lying to you!
Where is that monk now?
I've already scared him away.
Palm Leaf Cave
The king has returned!
Where's grandma?
She's inside.
By what honor has the king come to visit today?
I heard that Sun Wukong and Tang Seng are coming here.
I'm afraid they want to use the palm leaf fan to pass Fiery Mountain.
That monkey is the one who harmed our son.
I'll get him sooner or later, we will have our revenge.
Darling, why are you crying?
That monkey has already been here.
I refused to give him the fan.
I don't know how, but he got inside my stomach.
It hurt so bad I thought I would die.
At last I had no choice but to give him the fan.
That's terrible, how could you give him the fan?
I gave him a false one.
A false one?
A banquet to celebrate the king's return
Please drink the fine wine.
The chicken is fragrant, the duck is beautiful, and the pig is fat.
I try my best to sing, I try my best to dance.
You must also try your best to drink.
My king! You dumped the old one.
You love another woman.
Countless tears were spilled for you.
When the light is out and the curtain is dropped, you will sleep alone.
You too will taste loneliness.
Pardon me for not making you company.
Even if we are on the same bed, we will sleep under separate sheets.
King, I'm drunk.
Darling, where did you put the real fan?
That monkey is very deceitful, and the pig has even greater skill.
If you're not careful they might trick you.
Our treasure is right here.
King, what are you thinking about? Why don't you take it?
My treasure.
Emerald Cloud Cave
Baby, have another cup. Drink.
Gold Dragon King has asked me to drink with him tonight
Then you should go.
That's right.
You should prepare the golden eyed beast for grandpa.
I will.
You should drink a little less tonight.
Otherwise I won't be able to wake you up.
It's terrible, grandpa's golden eyed beast has disappeared!
Are you all deaf and blind?
How could it just disappear?
Baby, don't mind them.
I'm afraid Zhu Bajie might have stolen it.
Maybe I should go over to Palm Leaf Cave.
What? You've had this planned all along.
You still want to go over to that shameless woman?
Please baby, don't cry.
I'll be back soon.
Palm Leaf Cave
Come over here, drink a little!
Now I can relax.
We don't have to worry about our treasure being stolen.
Even if they stole it, they wouldn't know to pull the silk thread.
Having just a pearl won't be of any use.
Pulling the thread will turn it into a fan, right?
King, you're drunk.
You forgot about your own treasure, and are asking me.
Lady, look at who I am.
Who are you?
I am Tang Seng's second apprentice, Zhu Bajie.
Sorry about bothering you, and thanks!
Bye!
Bull's wife is too flirtatious.
All her underlings are handsome.
Old Pig almost couldn't take it.
Using clever tricks and tactics,
I stole their treasure away.
This is a great accomplishment.
Sandy should be on his knees.
Monkey should learn from me.
Even Master will be astonished.
Old Pig is truly masterful.
Old Pig is truly masterful.
Fool, how are things going?
Not only did I get the fan,
Princess Iron Fan was my wife for half a day, too.
You got a good deal.
Hey, let me see the fan.
Why did you shrink it?
Old Pig, you do recognize me, right?
Stop joking around with me.
Who's joking around with you?
Fool, how did it go?
It was all for nothing.
Wuneng, did you borrow the fan?
I found Bull Demon King, but he refused.
Then, I turned into his look-alike.
I tricked Princess Iron Fan into giving me the fan.
But then Old Bull turned into your look-alike and tricked me into giving it back.
Old Bull's skills are great.
I got beaten up by him, too.
How could you get the fan and still be such a fool?
Not everything revolves around you!
Don't fight, we should quickly think of a solution.
In which... which direction is there no fire?
Of east, south, west, north, there's fire only to the west.
So we have no option but to go back.
This path is blocked, what other options do we have?
Bajie, don't talk like that.
There will always be obstacles in our path.
To complete our sacred task we must be strong in our faith.
We can't change our goal half way just because we encounter some obstacles.
The reason that we've been defeated is that we haven't worked together.
If the three of you work as one, put your strength together to fight Bull Demon King, then you will certainly be victorious.
We have heard the order of Master and will fight Bull Demon King to the end. to... to the end.
That's excellent!
We have all been through hardships.
I hope everyone will make an effort together with my disciples to defeat Bull Demon King and put out the flames of Fiery Mountain.
Otherwise this misery will never end.
We have heard the order of Master, to seek happiness for all.
Everyone work together!
All right!
Grandma, it's terrible!
Grandpa has been trapped, come quickly and look!
The fight's not over yet, not over.
Careful, careful.
Beast, all you have to is give us the fan and we'll spare your life.
Old Bull, where is the fan? Hand it over!
My... my wife... has it.
Darling, darling!
Save me, hurry!
Give them the fan.
King! All right, all right!
Wukong, you go one more time!
The End
Look, Mytyl. There's one.
Come on. Quick.
Give me the stick.
Get the crumbs.
We got him.
We got him!
- Do you think it's a thrush?
- I hope so.
No use fluttering.
I got you now.
- Let me see him, Mytyl.
- Be careful, Tyltyl.
You'll get him excited.
Hey, there.| Who goes there?
- Oh, a forester.
- Run! Quick!
What would that forester have did if he had caught us?
- Have done, Tyltyl. Have done.
- What would he had done?
- Put us in a dungeon and chopped off our heads.
- Just for one little bird?
- He's got a whole forest of them.
- It's against the law.
Mytyl?
- Oh, Myty.
- Oh, hallo, Angela.
What have you got there?
Something for Christmas?
It's a bird- a very rare bird.
It's a thrush, we think.
I trapped it in the royal forest.
I don't suppose... you wouldn't let me trade you something for it, would you?
I should say not.
Uh, what have you got?
I'd let you have Katrina.
You always liked her.
Yes, when she was new.
She's only been sewed up in that one little place.
I'm sorry.
Besides, I promised this bird to another little girl for Christmas.
Oh, she wouldn't mind, Mytyl.
Please, Myty.
Won't you trade?
Angela, close the window!
- You know better than that.
- It's Mytyl.
- She's got a bird.
- Oh, yes, yes... but aren't you sick enough, dear, without catching your death of cold?
- Come now. Close the window.
- Oh, Mother.
I've always wanted a bird like that.
Please, ask her to give her to me.
That one?
She'd never give anybody anything.
Who's the little girl you promised a bird for Christmas?
- Who do you suppose? Me.
- Then why didn't you say so?
The next time I go hunting,
I'll leave you at home.
Tyltyl, did you ever see such a Christmas tree?
Look at all the children.
Everyone’s having fun, aren't they?
Everyone except those fiddlers.
That must be hard work.
Is that Santa Claus with the white hair?
No,you goose. That's the butler.
Good evening.
We're not doing anything. Just looking.
- But wouldn't you like some cake?
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Come along. Help yourselves, both of you.
- Don't take any, Tyltyl.
- Huh?
We may not be rich, but we're not beggars, thank you.
Come, Tyltyl.
- Hello, Mummy.
- A fine hour to be getting home.
- Look, Mummy.
We caught the most beautiful bird.
- Where have you been?
- What kept you?
- Don't you want to see it?
I want to see your hands clean.
Put that down and wash up, both of you. Go.
Tylo, get away from there.
Keep away from this cage now.
Hello, Daddy.
I didn't know you were home.
Your mummy had to set the table, Mytyl.
Did you forget the time?
Uh, you know, Daddy,
I think the village clock is slow.
Did you hear that, Mummy?
The village clock's slow.
- She has eyes, hasn't she?
- Yes.
Didn't you see it was growing dark?
Well, I did.
But Angela Berlingot stopped us.
- I had to talk to her.
She's sick, you know.
- Hmm.
Then we looked in at the rich children's house.
And what do you think, Daddy?
They have a Christmas tree as high as the ceiling.
- Well.
- Never mind all that. Come along.
Get to your places. Come along.
Your father's been working in the forest all day and he's hungry.
For what we are about to receive... and for all thy, bounteous blessings,
O Lord, make us truly, thankful.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Mytyl, Tylette's after your bird!
- Tylette!
Get away from here!
Get away from this bird.
How many times have I told you, Mytyl, not to trap birds in the woods?
- But, Daddy, it's such fun.
- It's not much fun for the bird.
- But I need it.
- What for?
To sing for us.
What do you think, Mummy?
Angela Berlingot wanted me to give it to her.
Well, why didn't you?
It'd be something to cheer her up.
- Poor mite. Sick in bed all winter.
- It's not my fault she's sick.
- It's your fault you're selfish.
- You have so much that she hasn't, Mytyl.
- What have I got?
- Health, for one thing, to run free and play.
- Oh, that isn't anything.
- Oh, isn't it?
- I wouldn't like to stay in bed all day.
- I wouldn't mind.
That will do, Mytyl.
Stop talking and eat your supper.
- Mummy?
- What is it, Myty?
Why do we have to be so poor all the time?
Poor? Us?
Well, we are.
We can't even have a party for Christmas.
You have a roof over your head, haven't you, and warm clothes?
- These old things?
- And plenty to eat.
But nothing I like, nothing good.
Not like those rich children have- cakes, candies... dolls to play with, pretty dresses, everything.
- I have nothing!
- That's not true, dear.
- You have lots of things.
- What?
You have a father who works for you.
- And a mother who cooks and cleans and mends.
- What's that... when other people have so much more?
Big houses, servants, carriages that drive them.
And look at us.
Look at this old place.
Stop it, Mytyl!
Stop it at once.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- I'm not ashamed.
- I hate it. I hate it all!
- Be quiet!
One more word and you'll go straight to bed.
You're an ungrateful child.
One more word and you'll go straight to bed.
You're an ungrateful child.
- I don't care.
- Thoughtless, thankless.
- I'm so unhappy.
- Well, of course our unhappy,.
If you don't mend your ways, you'll never be happy. Never!
- Oh, it's you, Wilhelm.
- Come in, Wilhelm.
Have some supper with us.
Sortie, but I have no time.
- I'm afraid I have bad news.
- Why, what's wrong?
Orders from Andreas Hofer to mobilize at once.
- Mobilize?
- Oh, no.
Napoleon's soldiers are on the march again.
They're heading toward the frontier.
As close as that?
- Well, we-we stood them off before, didn't we?
- And we'll do it again.
We assemble in the village square tomorrow at noon.
- I'll be there.
- Till tomorrow then.
War.
- Daddy!
- Oh, Daddy.
- I don't want you to go.
- I must go, dear.
Why do they have to have war?
What makes war anyway?
The same thing that makes trouble everywhere- greed, selfishness, those not content with what they have.
But you're not like that, Daddy.
Why should you have to go?
That's what's wrong about it, Mytyl.
You can't be unhappy inside yourself... without making others unhappy too.
Remember that.
Come, come.
Finish your suppers, all of you.
Is there any more, Mummy?
You don't get stew like this in the army.
- Good night, dear.
- Mummy?
- Yes, dear?
- I'm sorry for the way I behaved at supper.
That's what you always say,
Mytyl, that you're sorry... but the next day you do the same thing right over again.
I know I do.
I don't know why.
Well, you must find out why.
Otherwise, you'll always be unhappy and discontented. You don't want that, do you?
- No.
- You want to be happy, don't you?
Yes, Mummy. Like you.
You're happy all the time, aren't you?
Well, nearly all the time, dear.
Don't worry, Mummy.
Daddy will come back.
Tyltyl, are you asleep?
No, I don't think so.
Are you?
How could I be asleep when I'm talking to you?
- Did you hear someone knocking?
- I heard something.
- I'd better get Daddy.
- Wait for me, Mytyl.
Didn't you hear me knocking?
- Why, yes, but-
- Well, why didn't you let me in then?
Who are you?
Why, haven't your eyes?
Can't you see?
- I'm Betylune.
- Betylune?
Yes, the Faity Betylune.
Well, it's a little dark to see clearly.
Dark?
Well, it needn't be.
Light up there.
It- It lighted, all by itself.
- How did you do that?
- Oh, don't ask foolish questions.
But Daddy can't even do that.
Hurry now, quick.
Hop into your clothes and be off.
- You've got to find the blue bird.
- The blue bird.
Of course. The bird that is blue.
The blue bird.
But why? Why would we find it?
Why? You want to be happy, don't you?
Of course. But what do
I want with a blue bird?
Oh, what a stupid girl you are.
Don't you know that the blue bird means happiness?
How could it?
Well, didn't I say it did?
Now get dressed, both of you.
Or better still, I'll do it for you.
Quiet now. Quiet.
Quiet. Be clothed!
Look, Tyltyl.
Even your boots are laced up.
Mummy wouldn't mind having you around all the time.
She wouldn't, eh?
Don't stand there staring.
Come along. We've no time to lose.
But, ma'am, tell me where to find the blue bird.
It isn't as easy as all that.
You must look for it yourself- in the past, in the future, everywhere.
- Are you coming with us?
- Certainly not. I've other things to do.
We're not allowed to go places alone at night.
Did I say you had to go alone?
You have friends, haven't you?
- Can we take Daddy?
- There's your dog Tylo.
Take him. He might be of some help to you.
And Tylette, your cat.
Take her, if you wish.
- Wake up, Tylo.
- Wake up!
Wake up, you lazy, creature.|
Stand up like a man.
- Mytyl, look!
- Tylo!
Mytyl. My little Mytyl.
And Tyltyl. Master Tyltyl.
I can talk. At last, I can talk.
Oh, if I only could have the day you fell in the lake.
I tried so hard to tell you to keep away.
- Who are you?
- Quiet. We've no time for your gabble.
- We're in a dreadful hurry, Tylo.
- Why?
- I don't know, but she said we were.
- Quiet!
Tylette! Wake up!
Wake up, I say!
Can she talk too?
Well, naturally, if the dog can.
- Oh, Tylette, I'm so glad.
We've got to find a blue bird.
- A blue bird?
I'll come. I'll help you.
I love going places.
You'll come too, won't you, Tylette?
Why not? It might be amusing.
- I don't like the way she said that.
- Why, Tylo.
Come on. Come on now, all of you.
Be on your way. Hurry!
We shouldn't take Tylette with us.
She's treacherous.
I heard what you said, you old sniffle-snoot.
- I'll chew you to ribbons.
- Uncouth, isn't he?
What are you waiting for?
Come along!
Don't stand there gabbling all night.
Come along.
Well, what are you waiting for? Be off!.
- But which way shall we go?
- Oh, I told you.
You must look everywhere.
- But we'll get lost.
- It's so dark.
Oh, don't cry before you're hurt.
I'll take care of that. Light!
Appear.
It's the queen.
Oh, what little dunces you are not to know this brilliant lady... when you've seen her hundreds of times.
This is Light.
Light, may I present Mytyl and Tyltyl.
- How do you do, Light?
- How do you do?
And my name's Tylette.
How do you do?
There's no need to be formal.
We're old friends.
Where would you like to go?
I shall be your guide.
- We're not quite sure where to go.
- Why don't you use your head?
Hasn't it occurred to you that the blue bird might be hiding in the past?
But where is the past?
Do you know the way?
Why, of course.
The past is just behind us.
Come. I'll show you.
Now, remember.
Somewhere there's a blue bird.
Find it. Never give up till you do.
If you fail, nothing can save you.
Find the blue bird.
We'll find it. I promise.
Listen, you.
I know we've never been friends... but now we've got to work together.
- We can't allow the children to go through with this search.
- Why not? Why can't we?
Don't you see?
We're free now.
If they succeed, if they do find the blue bird... we'll have to go back to just what we wereumb slaves to man.
That's the way I like it.
Man is the master. We must obey him.
Oh! I always knew you were a fool.
If they want to look for a blue bird or a pink owl, I'm going to help them.
- The road to the past lies through here.
- But this is the graveyard.
That's the only way to the past.
- You must lead now.
- Aren't you coming?
Oh, no. Light has no business in a graveyard.
But I'll be waiting for you.
- Suppose we don't find the way?
- Are you afraid to try?
- Of course I'm not afraid.
- Then you'll find the way, dear.
- Who's afraid of what?
- We're going through the graveyard.
Oh, is that so?
The-The graveyard!
One more thing.
And this is most important.
It is now nearly midnight.
- Oooh!
- You must be back within the hour.
Otherwise, you will remain in the past... forever.
- Mytyl, I don't think we better go.
- Hush.
Well, follow me.
- This place is bad enough in the daytime.
- Fraidy cat!
Fraidy dog, please.
I'm scared, Mytyl.
There's nothing to be... afraid of.
I often come here... just to browse around.
When you're not browsing up dark alleys.
What's that?
- A g-g-ghost.
- Oh, Mytyl!
There's no such thing as a... ghost.
- There is too. I saw one once.
- Oh, no, Tylo!
I've met dozens of ghosts.
Most of them are perfectly charming.
- Tylo, where are you going?
- I just r-r-remembered something I got to do.
Oh, no, you can't leave us now.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll go over the wall and around- the graveyard... and I'll- I'll see you-
- What is this I'm in?
- That's an open grave.
There goes our brave protector.
Shall we continue?
- Let's turn back, Mytyl.
- Don't you be a coward too.
Oh, it's only at midnight you have to be careful.
- Why?
- What happens then?
Midnight is the witching hour.
The graves open.
- The dead arise.
- The dead!
Tylette, you're just trying to scare us.
You're not afraid. Not very.
Well, I'm not.
- But I'd rather not see any graves open.
- Why not?
It's rather thrilling. Come.
While we're waiting, I'll show you some of my favorite tombstones.
We've no time for that now.
We've got to go on to the past.
But this is the past, right here.
Oh, no, it can't be.
Light said to go through the graveyard.
But Light doesn't know. I do.
Tylette, don't go so fast.
Tylette, where are you?
- Here I am.
- Where?
Tylette! Tylette!
The clock!
Three, four-
Five, s-s-six-
It's midnight, Tyltyl.
I don't want to see any dead people!
- Neither do I.
- Oh, Mytyl, Mytyl!
Tyltyl, look!
I'm afraid!
But there aren't any dead people. Look.
Do you suppose Mummy was right?
You know, she always told us nobody ever really dies.
Oh, let's go, Mytyl.
I don't like it here.
Oh, look. It's Granny's and Grandpa's graves.
- I wish they were here with us.
- Me too.
I wouldn't be so afraid.
Somebody must be thinking of us.
I'm beginning to feel quite strong.
I have pins and needles all down my legs.
We're going to have visitors.
They seem to be quite near.
Now I can get on with my carving.
I've been at this one for nearly a whole year.
That's because we're so seldom awake.
- Grandpa.
- The children!
Granny! Grandpa!
My dears! Mytyl.
Tyltyl! Oh.
Another hug.
A big one this time.
It's months and months that you've forgotten us.
Yes, the last time, let me see, it was Easter morning.
The church bells were ringing.
Easter? Oh, we didn't go out that day.
We both had very bad colds.
- No, but you thought of us.
- Yes, we missed you.
Well, every time you think of us, we wake up and see you again.
But we thought you were dead.
No, dear. Only when we're forgotten.
Will they never learn back there?
The garden, the house... everything’s just the same.
Oh, Granny, I'm so glad to be here!
Come in, children. Come in.
I'm afraid we can't, Granny.
We can't stay very long.
What's that? What's that?
Can't stay very long?
- I'm afraid not.
- But I want to bake you an apple tart.
I wish we could stay, Granny.
Oh, look, Grandpa, you haven't finished little Ko-Ko yet.
What chance have I got when
I'm always asleep?
- Would you like to see my workshop, Tyltyl?
- Oh, yes!
Come along then.
- Don't be long, Tyltyl.
- Oh, you're in no hurry.
Yes, but we are. We must be back within the hour.
What time is it, Granny?
See? As soon as you think of it, it comes to life.
Now, come along. Sit down.
It's only 20 past 12:00.
- But the sun is shining.
- It's always shining here when you think of us.
Granny, the reason why, we're here, we've got to find a blue bird.
It's terribly important.
A blue bird? Oh, yes.
I'm sure we've got one.
Really, Granny?
Where? Show me!
Oh, all right, child, if we must.
We'll look in the birdhouse.
Come along.
There you are, dear.
All sorts and colors.
You can have any, one you like.
Isn't there a blue one?
Why, yes, there's a blue one.
That one up there singing.
Why, Granny, he isn't blue.
He's black.
Black? That's strange.
He's always looked blue to me.
There isn't one here, not a single blue bird.
Won't one of these do?
Oh, no. Betylune said it must be blue.
She said to look everywhere.
- This is the past, isn't it?
- Yes, dear.
But perhaps your blue bird isn't in the past... and you'll have to look somewhere else.
- I better go then.
- Oh, no, not yet, not yet.
Will you show me how to carve one too, Grandpa?
Yes, if you'll come more often to see us.
Mytyl, what do you think?
These little people whistle.
- I know that. Come on. We've got to go.
- Aw, you can't go yet.
- Can't you stay a few minutes longer?
- We shouldn't, Granny.
But I wanted you to hear them.
I've taught them to whistle a tune.
Anything you like.
You name it, Mytyl.
- Uh, how about ''Farmer in the Dell''?
- Oh, yes.
Aw, who wants that silly thing?
How about a ''Lay-de-o''?
- That's the one.
- Yes, ''Lay-de-o.''
- You used to sing that to me in my cradle. Remember?
- Yes, dear.
Look, Mytyl. This one plays music too.
Nice, dear. Just like old times.
We've really got to go now, Granny.
Come on, Tyltyl. What time is it?
Why, it's still just 20 past 12:00.
Oh, my goodness! Something's wrong!
Tyltyl, we've got to run.
Oh, no! Don't go! Don't go.
If you stay, I'll bake you the biggest apple tart you've ever tasted.
We haven't time, Granny, really.
- Good-bye, Grandpa.
- Good-bye, Tyltyl.
- Don't wait too long to come to us again.
- I won't.
Good-bye, darling.
Think of us often.
- You don't know how much it means.
- We will, Granny.
- Good-bye, Tyltyl.
- Good-bye, Granny.
Come on, Tyltyl.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Always in such a hurry.
I'll never get this finished.
Couldn't something have made them stay?
Not even my apple tarts.
Never mind, dear.
It was nice to have them remember us at all.
I suppose so.
Perhaps it won't be so long... till the next time.
Well, they're lost, that's all there is to it.
If they're lost, they're lost.
It's their own fault for straying into the graveyard.
- Why didn't you follow them, see which way they went?
- Why didn't you?
You're so loyal and brave.
I think I see them coming.
There they are!
- Tylo!
- I thought you were lost.
Tylette. What happened to you?
- Well, what happened to you?
- We've been with Granny and Grandpa.
In the Land of Memory.
Did you find the blue bird?
No, there were no blue birds there. Not one.
- I could have told you that in the first place.
- Why didn't you then?
Because no one took the trouble to inquire.
What do you think we ought to do now?
You haven't found the blue bird.
You must keep on looking.
All this fuss about a blue bird.
I could be happy with a big juicy beefsteak.
Why don't you go to the Land of Luxury?
There's plenty to eat there.
Everything you can think of.
Do you think we'd find the blue bird there?
- No, dear, I don't.
- Why, not?
Everyone has everything they want there.
Where would be a better place to look for the blue bird?
If they've got beefsteaks, it won't hurt to look.
We might find the blue bird there.
Very well. Go ahead, if you want to.
- How do we get to the Land of Luxury?
- It's very easy.
- We take the first side road.
- Will you wait for us?
Yes, dear. Just beyond.
But don't let them keep you very long.
- It isn't wise to spend too much time with luxuries.
- We won't.
I'll show you the way.
[ Doorbell Chiming }
Yes, miss?
- Are the Luxury’s at home?
- What name shall I say?
Mytyl and friends.
Won't you step in?
This way, please.
Wait here, please.
There. What did I tell you?
Isn't it magnificent?
Mmm. I smell dinner.
Oh, Mytyl, these banisters, wouldn't you love to slide down them?
Shh.
Rich people never slide down banisters.
Mr. and Mrs. Luxuty!
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do?
Are you Mrs. Luxury?
Yes. Yes, indeed, I am.
And this is Mr. Luxury.
How do you do?
How do you do?
- This is my brother, Tyltyl.
- Charmed.
- Oh, and Tylette.
- Charmed.
What an enchanting place.
Such exquisite taste.
It's simple, but we like it.
We're looking for a blue bird, and we thought you might have one.
A blue bird?
We're having pheasant with truffles.
Do you prefer blue birds?
How do you prepare one?
- Oh, we didn't want to eat it.
- Oh, how nice.
- I say, old fellow, do you like desserts?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Then you shall have them- dozens of them... with maraschino cherries and whipped cream.
You can have anything you like.
You can do anything you like.
- Can I even slide down this banister?
- Oh, certainly.
I'd join you, but I've had my slide for today.
- You like dolls, don't you, and pretty dresses?
- Oh, yes, ma'am, I do.
- She's never had very many.
- Oh, I can see that.
In a party, dress with some jewels... you'll really be quite presentable.
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, you're too kind, Mrs. Luxury.
Oh, not at all. She's such a darling.
Come along upstairs.
- Come along.
- Come along, old man.
Oh. Come on, Tylo.
[ Mrs. Luxury }
Tylo?
[ Mr. Luxury }
Who's that fellow?
Oh, that's Tylo. He's with us.
I'm afraid we haven't any more guest rooms.
Perhaps your friend wouldn't mind bunking in the servants' quarters.
- Is that all right, Tylo?
- Well, if there's no room in the house.
Beg pardon, sir.
The servants' quarters are all full.
However, there's a most comfortable place in the Kennels.
- Kennels?
- Splendid! Splendid! Show him the way.
Come, Fido.
- Tylo!
- Tylo.
- You'll be all right, Tylo.
- Now don't you worry.
He'll be taken care of,
I promise you.
Come upstairs, darlings.
All the way up.
- Let me give you a piggyback.
- Oh, yes!
This way to the kennels.
I might have known
I'd end up in the doghouse.
Go away. I said, go away.
But you're getting on on the wrong side, sir.
I'll get on any side that I like!
- You're not big enough to get on by yourself, sir.
- I am too!
- Stop this thing. Stop it, I say.
- Yes, miss. Just a moment.
Stop it at once.
I want to ride the pony.
Oh, be careful, miss.
- You get down, Tyltyl.
It's my turn to ride.
- It is not.
- It is too. You go ride on the merry-go-round.
- I don't like the merry-go-round.
- Well, it's my pony.
- It is not.
- The Luxury’s gave it to me!
- That's not true.
They gave it to both of us.
- Children. Children.
- It's my pony, isn't it, Groom?
- It is not!
- Let go of those reins.
- I won't!
- I'll make you. Get off this pony!
- I won't.
- You will too. Let go of me, you-
- Oh, sir.
- Little beast!
Oh, sir, please.|
- Oh, gracious!
- Mytyl! Tyltyl!
- Stop it, children! Stop it, I say!
- That'll do! Mytyl! Tyltyl!
- What the devil's all this?
- It's not my fault, sir, I swear.
- He pulled my hair.
- And she kicked me.
- I'll kick you again.
- Children.
Why didn't you think to get each of them a pony?
Then they wouldn't have anything to quarrel over.
Why didn't you? Well, don't stand there gaping.
Go and get another pony.
- Very good, sir.
- All right.
You can have this old pony, but they'll get me a better one.
Oh, no. You keep this one.
I'll take the better one.
- You will not. I'll get there first.
- Oh, no, you won't.
There just seems to be no satisfying them.
If you ask me, they're spoiled.
Oh, Mr. Luxury.
- May I come in?
- What is it? You ought to be in bed.
I was, but I couldn't go to sleep.
Oh! What did you do to your foot?
I didn't do anything to it. It's the gout.
And don't you touch it!
Oh, I wasn't going to touch it.
- Don't you even come near it.
- Does it hurt when I even come near it?
It hurts when you even look at it.
Now go on. Off to bed you go.
- Well, good night.
- Oh, good night, good night, good night.
- Mr. Luxury.
- Oh, are you still here?
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you want?
I thought you might like to read to me.
- Why should I?
- My daddy does sometimes at home.
Well, that's a silly idea, and you can tell your daddy I said so.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Good night.
- Mr. Luxury.
- Yes, what is it now?
Don't you like to talk things over with somebody before you go to bed?
Talk what things over?
Oh, nothing.
Do you mind if
I kiss you good night?
Good heavens!
I could shut my eyes and pretend it's Daddy.
A fine time of night to start playing games!
Oh, all right.
Come here.
- Be careful you don't touch my foot.
- Yes, sir.
Look out, you clumsy little wretch!
- Oh, I didn't mean it.
- Go on, get out!
Get out!
Tylo!
Tylo!
Oh, it's you.
Oh, Tylo, I've missed you so.
Missed me? You knew I was here, didn't you?
- What have you been doing?
- Nothing.
- Even the dogs here won't play with me.
- Why not, Tylo?
I have no pedigree.
Oh, Tylo, I'm unhappy too.
Oh, my little Mytyl.
Nobody here is kind.
Not really kind.
Not like Mummy and Daddy.
I wouldn't trade them for all the Mr. and Mrs. Luxury’s in the world.
Even if they are poor, huh?
Mummy and Daddy are not poor.
They just haven't any money.
There's a difference.
What do you say we get out of here?
Where's Tyltyl?
I don't know.
We're not speaking.
What? Not speaking?
What's this place doing' to us all?
We must get out of here.
But we can't.
We can't get away from the Luxury’s.
Just let 'empty to stop us. Come on.
You better get dressed.
Oh, Tyltyl, I'm so sorry for everything.
There's no use saying you're sorry now.
Please make up, Tyltyl.
I've been so lonely without you.
There. Now kiss and make up.
Quick, quick.
We're going to leave, Tyltyl, right now.
- Good, good! I'm ready!
- Shh! Where are your clothes?
- In there.
- Put them on. Quick.
- Hurry, Tyltyl.
- I will.
What'll we do if they catch us?
Don't you worry.
I'll get you out.
What is this? A conspiracy?
We're leaving this place, Tylette.
Leaving? Why?
Because we don't like it.
That's why.
I think it's a great mistake.
It's so very enjoyable here.
If you want to stay, stay.
We'd be better off without you.
Oh, no! We can't leave Tylette.
Have no fear, Mytyl.
I'll go along, for your sake.
I'm ready!
Come on! Quiet now.
- Tylette!
- It just... fell.
What was that?
What is it? What's happened?
What in thunder was that noise?
What is it? What's happened?
Don't stand there gaping at me. Answer me!
- Answer me!
- The urn at the top of the stairs, sir.
- What about the urn at the top of the stairs, sir?
- It's now at the bottom.
- Huh?
- Oh, Mr. Luxury, Mr. Luxury!
- What is it now?
- The children are gone.
- Gone?
- Yes, sir. Their beds are empty.
Where have they gone to?
Don't all stand there looking like fools!
Look for them!
Go on, look for them!
- Let's go.
- Don't be foolish.
- He'll catch us, Tylo.
- We'll outrun them. Go ahead.
There they go! After them!
After them! Come back!
Hey, come bacj!
Come bacj! Hey!
Let them go!
Well, of all the ill-mannered exhibitions!
I'm glad they've gone.
Well, maybe they know what they're doing.
Not at all! They're just too young to appreciate luxury.
And we're too old to escape from it.
Look, the moon's coming up.
That's not the moon.
That's Light coming to meet us.
You're tired, aren't you?
We shouldn't have gone there at all.
You didn't find the blue bird, did you?
We forgot to look.
That always happens there.
You wouldn't have found it anyway.
I'm afraid we've just wasted our time.
- You wouldn't want to go back, would you?
- Oh, no.
- Never. Never.
- Then you haven't wasted your time.
We almost didn't get away, at all.
- Thanks to Tylette.
- Oh, what did I do?
Oh, nothing at all.
Just crashed a statue and roused the whole house... to help us sneak away, quietly,.
- You've been seeing things, Tylo.
- You bet I have.
And someday I'm going to take you by the neck and shake your head right off.
Just try it, if you want to get your eyes scratched out.
Oh, stop it. Stop it, you two!
You do nothing but fight.
- What do you think we ought to do now?
- I think you ought to rest.
Tyltyl's almost asleep.
Why don't you sleep a little while too?
- I am tired.
- Then sleep.
I'll be back to wake you.
Father Oak!
Father Oak!
- Eh? Eh?
- Oh, there you are.
Oh, what-what's all the commotion?
I've been shouting my, lungs out for you.
- What's that?
- Didn't you hear me calling you?
- No.
- You get deafer and deafer.
It's the din of the woodsman's ax always ringing in my ears.
- Summon the others, will you?
- What others?
Pine, Elm, Walnut, Maple-
Summon them all!
Now what's up? From your tone, one would think the world was coming to an end.
If you don't do as I say, our world will come to an end.
- Oh, as bad as all that, eh?
- Worse.
- Hello! Hello!
- Summon them all! Willow, Lime, Beech!
Hello! Come along there, Beech!
Come on, Elm.|
We're waiting.
Hello.|
What's all the excitement? What's up?
Trees, what's the trouble?
- We don't know.
- Hello.|
Always something.
Nothing' but trouble!
Getting me up in the middle of the night!
The old Crab Apple.
Now what's the matter with her?
Stop that blubbering, Willow.
Save your weeping for the river.
I can't bear it. I can't.
Bear what?
Uh, things.
Just things.
You see what I'm up against?
Come along. We don't need her.
I've got to get back.
- Well, I guess there are enough of us here.
- Then speak up.
- What's the matter?
- Why are we here?
Children of the woodcutter, your mortal enemy... are on their way here, looking for the blue bird.
The blue bird?
I've put as many obstacles in their way as I can.
Now it's up to you.
What do you want us to do?
Frighten them. Terrify them.
Put the fear of the devil into them!
So that they'll forget what they came for and go back where they belong.
Remember what it means.
- Oak, I'll rely upon you.
- Yes.
- We'll fix them!
- That's right!
- It's going to be jolly, huh?
- Jolly? Are you all daft?
Didn't you hear what she said?
They're after the blue bird.
What good will it do to frighten them?
They'll only come back again and again.
- No, we must destroy them.
- Destroy them!
That's what man has done to us for centuries.
- Yes, they've felled us by thousands.
- And shivered our timbers.|
- He's right!
- They must not escape.
Go tell Wind.
Whip him into a frenzy.
Get even our enemies to help.
Fire, Lightning- Let them all know.
Tell them, if need be, we'll sacrifice even ourselves. Anything!
But there must be no mistake.
There must be no failure.
Those children must die!
- Oak's right!
- I'll beat them with my branches!
- We'll do away with them!
- Go! Go quickly, all of you!
Isn't it peaceful and quiet?
But I don't see any blue birds.
I don't see any birds at all.
Well, the trees are full of them. You'll see.
Oh, Mytyl, look at this big old tree.
Wouldn't Daddy love to chop it down?
Looks like a storm is blowing up.
We'd better go someplace till this blows over.
Mytyl, wait.|
Why, don't we hide in here?
First time a tree ever turned on me.
Tylo.| Here, I'll help you up.
Are you hurt?
It is a storm. I knew it.
- Looks more like a tornado.
- Don't get excited. There's no danger.
Come on! We'd better get out of here!
Come on, Tyltyl.
No, no! This way!
Mytyl! Mytyl!
- Are you hurt?
- I'm all right.
- Let's keep on going.
- Come on. I'll take care of you.
Follow me!
I know the way out!
- Let's go back!
- The storm's worse back there. Come on!
This way!
Come on!
Don't listen to her!
She's trying' to trap us!
Help! Help!
Save me!
- Tylette!
- Come back here!
- We've got to save her, Tylo!
- You can't go through that fire!
- We've got to!
- It's too late! We'll be burned up ourselves!
Quick, into the boat!
Oh, Light, will you forgive us?
We shouldn't have gone without you.
You're safe now.
That's all that matters.
We've been rowing all night.
Lightning struck.
The whole forest went up in flames.
Yes, Lightning and Fire are my stepbrothers.
They can be very wicked.
- We nearly got burned up.
- Tylette did get burned up.
She got what she deserved.
Oh, don't say that, Tylo.
Poor Tylette.
There, dear. Don't be unhappy.
What about the blue bird?
We didn't see one. Not one.
We didn't have time to look.
If you ask me, there isn’t no such bird.
Oh, there is, Tylo. There must be.
Of course there is.
You haven't looked everywhere.
There's still the Kingdom of the Future.
- The future?
- Why, yes.
- So many wonderful things are in the future.
- Not me.
I've seen enough wonderful things.
- Oh, please, Tylo.
- You've got to come with us, Tylo.
Sorry. All I can see in the future for me is aching bunions.
- Then will you wait for us?
- Gladly. And take your time.
Come. We'd better get started.
- Is the future far?
- No, just over the hill.
Keep climbing up and up as far as you can go.
Can't you come with us this time?
You won't need me.
When you're ready to leave,
I'll come for you.
Did you ever see so many children?
You don't suppose they're all one family?
Look! Live children!
Look at the live children!
- Why do they call us ''live children''?
- I don't know.
Let's go talk to them.
You're live children, aren't you?
- Of course we're alive. Aren't you?
- Oh, no.
Not yet. We're waiting to be born.
How funny you're dressed!
I was thinking the same about you.
- What are those things on your feet?
- They're my shoes.
Shoes?
What are they for?
They're to protect your feet from thorns and stones and from the cold.
It's all very confusing, but I suppose we'll understand it when we're born.
- Why don't you get born?
- Oh, we will, but we have to wait our turn.
I'll be born in three years.
- I'm going to be born to a throne.
- Is it nice on Earth?
- Oh, yes. It's all right.
- It's beautiful.
Mytyl.| Oh, Mytyl!
- Mytyl!
- Hello.
- You're Mytyl and Tyltyl.
- How do you know our names?
That's not very surprising.
I'm going to be your little sister.
- What?
- Our sister?
Oh! You're coming to live with us.
- Yes.
- When?
Well, I don't know just when.
In a year perhaps.
- That's wonderful.
- Yes, in a way.
''In a way''? There'll be three of us.
We'll have lots of fun.
- Not for very long.
- Why, not?
I'll only be with you a little while.
And then you're going away?
- Yes.
- Oh.
- It's hardly worthwhile you coming at all, is it?
- Shh!
It would seem so, but we can't pick and choose.
What are they doing?
- They are working.
- Working at what?
Oh, all kinds of things.
Go and see, if you like.
They won't mind.
Oh, it's been wonderful seeing you.
- Good-bye, little sister.
- Good-bye.
I'll tell Mummy you're coming.
Would you like to see my discovery?
- Oh, yes.
- What is it?
It doesn't look like much, I know, but it will save a lot of suffering.
- How?
- It will put people to sleep when they're in pain.
Suppose you broke your arm.
This will put you to sleep while they fix it.
And I wouldn't feel anything? No pain?
How could you?
You'd be fast asleep.
It'll be very helpful, don't you think?
Oh, yes. Do hurry and get yourself born.
I will... soon.
Hello.
Hello.
Why are you so sad?
I was just thinking.
I'm going to Earth very soon now.
Almost any day.
- Don't you want to go?
- No, I'm afraid not.
You'll like it once you get there.
There's too much unhappiness.
Up here we are all free.
But we aren't born free, are we?
- Aren't we?
- Some are, perhaps.
But so many are born into slavery and greed... and injustice and cruelty.
That's what I'm going to fight.
I must tty to make them see that people must be the same on
Earth as they are up here- free, equal and united.
Then I should think you'd want to go.
No. They won't listen.
But they will.
You must make them listen.
They'll destroy me.
##[ Fanfare }
What's that?
That's Time. This is the hour when the children who are born today go down to Earth.
- How do they get down? Are there ladders?
- You'll see.
- A ship.
- With silver sails.
- Aldrich.
- [ Boy, } Here.|
Allison.
- Allison!
- Come along, Allison.
- Heer.|
- Arnheim.
- Heer.|
- Armitage.
Armitage!
Baxter.
- Heer!
- Burning.
Burning, that's you!
Good-bye, everybody.
Don't give up your ideas.
Keep on working.
- You'll be coming to Earth soon.
- Good-bye!
Carter. Castle.
- Why are you crying?
- Because I'm afraid.
What of? What's the matter?
I'm afraid they won't call my name.
You mean you want to go?
Oh, yes. I've wanted to go for so long.
- But Mama and Papa haven't time for me.
- Don't they want you?
I'm sure they would if they knew how happy we could all be.
Danfield. Deering.
That's me! He just called my name!
- That's me! That's me!
- You see?
They do want you. Go on now.
Go on. Hurry.
Go right along. Go along.
- My name is Deering.
- I know. Go right along.
Eggert.
Evans and Evans.
Evans and Evans.|
- Here!
- Here!
Elam. Everett.
Finklehoff.
All right. Run right along, right along.
Here, here, here. You can't deceive me.
Go back. It's not your turn.
You too, young man.
They didn't call your name.
Go back! Go back!
Faulkner.
- Ferguson.
- What? More salesmen?
There are too many already.
We're having complaints.
- Well, run along, run along.
- Flanagan.
- Where are the engineers?
Oh, there you are.
- Frobischer.
Hammond.
Humboldt.
Here, here, here, here! No, you don't.
Come here, come here.
This is the third time you've tried to be born before your time.
Don't you let me catch you at it again.
Now go along. Go along!
Your name was called. Come along.
You heard me. Come along.
What's the trouble here?
You're holding us up.
Please. Let me stay behind with her.
- Can't I go with him?
- Impossible.
- I'd rather not be born then.
- You cannot choose.
Please. We love each other, and I shall be born too late.
I will be gone before she comes down.
- I shall never see him again.
- That is no concern of mine.
Don't you understand?
We shall be alone in the world.
- I unite and part as I'm told. Come.
- Oh, no!
I won't be born! I won't!
Oh, leave him with me.
Leave him, please.
Come, come. He's not going to die, but to live.
I shall be the saddest thing on Earth.
I shall love you always.
Come.
No! No!
No!
Come along.
Your name was called. Come along.
Come along. Come along there.
Come along.
Good luck.
Wayne.
- Young.
- Here.|
- Zimmerman.
- Come along, Zimmerman. Come along.
That is all for today.
- We're going!
- We're going!
Bye!
Who's that singing now?
Those are the voices of their mothers coming out to meet them.
Hurry, Mytyl!
I want to see Mummy and Daddy.
I can't wait to tell them all the places we've been.
But the blue bird-What do we do?
What do we say to Faity Betylune?
Tell her the truth.
We went everyplace she said- looked everywhere.
That's what you must tell her.
You've done your best.
Maybe there isn't any blue bird.
That's what I've been saying ever since we started.
You'd better go in now.
Aren't you coming in too, so you can help us explain?
No, dear. I have many places to go.
Won't we see you anymore?
Of course you will.
I'll always be with you.
Not as you see me now... but you will know me.
I'll be in every moonbeam, in every star that shines... in every dawn that rises... and every lamp that's lit... in every good and bright thought of your soul.
You understand, don't you?
Yes, I think so.
Good-bye then, until we meet again.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Wake up! Wake up, Mytyl and Tyltyl, you sleepy, heads.
Wake up!
I declare, you'd sleep the clock around if I let you.
Mummy. Oh, Mummy!
It's Mummy, Tyltyl!
- Mummy! We're home!
- It is you!
Well, of course it's me.
Who did you think it was?
- Oh, I'm so glad, Mummy.
- What's the matter with you children?
- It's so good to see you again.
- It's been such a long time.
What nonsense.
You've been dreaming.
- Come, get dressed.
- It wasn't a dream.
We saw Granny and Grandpa, didn't we, Tyltyl?
Yes, and Grandpa's still carving those little whistlers.
What are you children talking about?
And Granny's just the same as she was.
- Exactly,.
- What's this noise about?
Daddy!
Oh, Daddy, it's so good to see you.
There's something wrong with these children.
They must have eaten something last night that didn't agree with them.
- They look all right to me.
- They're talking such nonsense about seeing their grandparents.
- We did, Daddy. We really did.
- But we're home now.
And we missed you so.
You mean you're going to miss me when I go to war.
Oh, I forgot.
- Who's that now?
- I'll go.
Hop into your clothes now, both of you.
Hurry up.
Wilhelm. But you said we were to assemble at noon at the village square.
That's right, we were.
But now you can spen
 your Christmas at home.
- What? What happened?
- A truce was declared last night.
- A truce?
- The treaty is being signed today.
- Oh, praise God!
- A stroke of the pen is better than a stroke of the sword, no?
Last night I felt like a demon coming with such news.
Ah, but this morning you're like Santa Claus.
- With the gift of peace.
- And that's a gift worth having.
They all say that when I tell them.
- Well, good-bye. Merry Christmas!
- Good-bye. Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Daddy, is it true?
You don't have to go to war?
- Yes, dear, it's true.
- Isn't it wonderful news?
- Oh, I'm so glad, Daddy.
- We're all glad, dear.
- Me too, Daddy. Me too.
- Good old boy.
Look, even Tylo's trying to tell you how glad he is, Daddy.
- Good old Tylo.
- He was wonderful.
As brave as anything.
He saved us from the fire.
- I tell you, there is something wrong with them.
- What's that about a fire?
The forest. The trees were all burned up.
So was Tylette.
Oh, the poor thing.
Well, she seems to have a very good appetite this morning.
But she lost her life in the fire.
- We couldn't save her.
- Is that so?
Well, cats do have nine lives.
- Maybe she has eight to go.
- That explains it.
She was awfully mean to us... wasn't she, Tylo?
Sic her, Tylo! Sic her!
Come along. Get to the table.
Your breakfast's all ready.
Oh, Mummy, everything’s so wonderful, isn't it?
So bright and shiny and beautiful.
Is it? Why, it's just the same as it's always been.
Oh, no. It's different.
Quite different.
Your Daddy got up at daybreak to make a cage for your bird.
Do you like it?
Tyltyl, look!
My bird! Look what's happened to it.
It was brown when we caught it, and now it's changed.
It's blue. It's the blue bird!
- The blue bird?
- Blue bird?
Yes. We looked everywhere for it. Everywhere.
And all the time it was right here.
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.
What's come over the child?
I've never seen her so.
Oh, she's just happy, that's all.
- It's hard to catch, isn't it?
- Angela!
You're up! You're walking!
Yes, Mother. Look, it's Mytyl's bird.
She's given it to me.
It's a blue bird, Mrs. Berlingot.
Oh, Angela, I can't believe it.
Mytyl, it's a miracle.
I must run and tell your father.
- Can I hold him now?
- Yes, in a minute.
Hold him gently now. Gently.
Oh, he's so soft and warm.
Do you suppose he's-
Oh, it's gone!
Oh, Mytyl!
I was so happy, and now it's gone!
Don't worry, Angela.
We'll find it again.
Oh, we can't. We can't ever.
Oh, yes, we can. I know we can.
But how do you know?
Are you sure, Mytyl?
Yes, Angela, I'm sure.
Because now we know where to look for it... don't we?
Now will you give me my chalk?
Try that again and I'll put you on solitary confinement, you would-be Frankenstein.
Don't profane his name with your dirty lips.
He was a genius in whose footsteps
I will follow when I get out of here.
"When you get out."
If I have anything to say about it, you'll never get out.
But I will.
Now, friend Daniel, shall we go on with our work?
Now, this brain is taken from the man and transplanted into the skull of the dog, but given the mind of a human being...
Now, Frankenstein would have severed the spinal cord here, but I'm not certain that he was right.
Could Frankenstein have made me like other men?
He gave life to a body that he made from parts of other bodies that had died.
Yes, Daniel, he could have made you like other men.
Dr. Niemann, did you know Frankenstein?
No. But my brother, who assisted him, learned his secrets.
And before he died, he passed them on to me.
Then you could give me a new body.
If I had Frankenstein's records to guide me,
I could give you a perfect body.
Hyah! Hyah!
Try it again, Herman!
Now, all together!
We could help you.
My arms are strong.
Well, thank you, whoever you are.
Take the front wheel. We'll take this.
Try it again! We have help!
Push!
Hyah! Hyah!
May I offer you the warmth of my living wagon?
Thank you.
So you're a merchant that's been held for ransom by mountain bandits.
For the better part of three months.
And that's your servant?
Do you doubt me?
It's a doubting world, kind sir.
As I, Professor Bruno Lampini, have reason to know.
I have a collection of the world's most astounding horrors.
When I exhibit them, what do I get?
Doubts, jeers, cries of "Fake! Fake!"
You expect your patrons to believe that the skeleton you show them is really that of Count Dracula?
I, Lampini, took it.
Pardon me. Borrowed it from the cellar of Dracula's castle in the Carpathian Mountains.
With my own two hands I spread upon the floor of its coffin a layer of soil taken from its birthplace.
So that by proxy, shall we say, the skeleton of his earthbound spirit might lie at peace within his grave.
Until the withdrawal of the wooden stake from its heart set Dracula free again to satisfy his unholy appetite for blood.
At night, the giant bat would seek its victims.
But before sunrise, return to the safety of his coffin.
Aye, a single ray of sunlight falling upon a vampire would make him helpless.
Do you ever exhibit your show in Visaria?
Visaria...
No. That's a town that doesn't care for horrors.
They had one of their own some 15 years ago when a Dr. Niemann tried to give a dog the mind of a human being.
They threw him in prison because he, like Frankenstein, used bodies of the newly-dead to carry on his work.
Is old Hussman still alive?
He's now the mayor of Reigelberg.
Are you going there, by any chance?
Oh, later on in the season.
It's a small place. Too far away to make a special trip profitable.
Nevertheless, that is where you are going.
I am not going to Reigelberg.
Then Daniel and I will go alone.
No. No!
Now the driver.
Well, you seem worried, friend Daniel.
If they search the ruins of the prison, our bodies will not be found.
We should hide.
And so we shall, but in the open.
All the protection of a traveling show.
I as Lampini, you as my assistant.
Free to move on towards those for whom I have unloving memories.
The ones who sent you to prison?
Strauss, Ullman, and old Hussman, the burgomaster.
Yes, friend Daniel, we will travel to the village of Reigelberg and pay our respects to the Burgomaster.
Your move, Inspector.
That's a neat trap you've got me into.
Checkmate. Put it in the book, Inspector.
- Grandfather?
- Yes.
He's here, Carl.
As a man, I admire you.
As burgomaster, I respect you.
But as a chess player,
Herr Hussman, I hate you.
Did you lose again, Inspector?
It serves you right.
I told you not to play with him.
He always wins, don't you, you old darling?
I hope we're not breaking up your game, but Carl and I have decided...
She means she has decided.
To take in the midnight show of the horror exhibit down at the crossroads.
Spooks, ghouls, vampires.
Get his hat and coat, Carl.
You're going with us.
To stare at a lot of idiotic humbugs?
Not I, my dear. I put my weary bones where they belong, in bed.
Your hat and coat.
I'm not going!
You'd better give in, Grandad.
These American girls can talk you into anything.
That's all they do, talk.
- What? What did you say?
- Aaah!
Now, now, darling.
Remember your blood pressure.
That's the man I married.
Talk, talk, talk, talk!
I can never get a word in edgewise.
Here, put this on.
No.
And no arguments.
- Come along, Inspector.
- No. No.
- You're coming with us, too.
- Oh, but I...
And I don't want any arguments from you either.
Come along. Come on.
Persuasive little minx, isn't she?
Brr! I'm all over goose pimples.
And properly so, you little goose.
Now, don't be grouchy. This is fun.
Master, police inspector.
It's all right, Daniel.
We have our permit.
Oh.
Now, there is something
I could really use.
I wonder where I could get one.
What for?
Just the thing to keep the wife under control.
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Step this way to gaze upon an exhibit absolutely unparalleled in the realms of showmanship.
No doubt there are some among you who will doubt the truth of what I am about to say or doubt the reality of what you are about to see.
But believe me, my friends, this is no fake.
Before your very eyes is all that remains of a vampire.
One of the world's undead.
Dare I but remove this stake from where his heart once beat, and he would rise from the grave within which he lies and turn into a bat, a vampire bat, who'd feed hideously upon the living, whose veins pulsate with warm and vibrant blood.
Ladies and gentlemen, the actual skeleton of Count Dracula, the vampire!
Rubbish. Sheer rubbish.
I don't know, Herr Hussman.
There are many people hereabouts who still believe in the old legend.
Aye, sir. It is true.
I'm surprised at you people.
You seem to doubt what I say,
Herr Burgomaster.
Bats. Vampires.
A stake driven through a skeleton's heart.
Gibberish. Every word of it.
Furthermore, my friends, one single ray of sunlight falling upon a vampire will destroy him.
Say, who are you?
My name is Lampini.
You're not the Lampini I ran out of this area three years ago?
That was my brother, recently deceased.
You remind me of someone.
Someone I can't quite recall.
Perhaps you will remember later,
Herr Burgomaster.
Yes, perhaps.
Drop the stick from your hand.
Drop it.
But if you move,
I'll send your soul back to the limbo of eternal waiting.
Do as I ask, and I will serve you.
I will protect the earth upon which you lie so that before sunrise, your coffin will always be ready for you.
For that,
I will do whatever you wish.
I hope I haven't spoiled your evening for you, Inspector.
As a matter of fact,
I found it most interesting.
But I say good night here.
- Good night, Carl.
- Good night, Inspector.
- Mrs. Hussman.
- Good night.
- See you in the morning, sir.
- Good night, Hans.
Don't get lost in the fog.
Well, you certainly picked a night for it, my pet.
It's like being wrapped in the arms of a gigantic ghost.
Ghosts, vampires!
Can't you talk about anything else?
Listen.
If you're going toward the inn, may I offer you the accommodation of my coach?
You don't have to say that twice.
Pardon me. I'm Carl Hussman and this is Mrs. Hussman.
We are here on our honeymoon.
My congratulations.
And this is my grandfather.
How do you do?
Herr Hussman.
Permit me to introduce myself.
I am Baron Latos from Transylvania.
Well, glad to know you, Baron.
May I suggest that you join me for a bottle of wine at the inn?
In the nature of, shall we say, a celebration, Mrs. Hussman?
Well, that's a wonderful idea if Grandad doesn't mind.
Yes. A glass of wine will warm my blood.
But you will accept our hospitality, Baron.
The wine of the country from my cellar.
Thank you, Herr Hussman.
Driver, stop at the Hussman home.
Oh, driver, go around to the kitchen.
Ask the cook to make you some coffee.
Thank you, Herr Burgomeister.
I drink to love.
A union to last throughout eternity.
A love free from all material needs.
I'll drink to that lack of material needs myself, Baron, but not till I raid the wine cellar, I won't.
Excuse me, darling. Be right back, Baron.
You admire my ring?
When I look at it,
I see glimpses of a strange world.
A world of people who are dead and yet alive.
It is the place from which I've just returned.
It frightens me.
Wear it.
It will drive away your fears.
It's too large.
It will become smaller.
No.
I'm afraid.
Take it back.
It is the bond that links us together.
I see your world more clearly now.
I'm no longer afraid.
I will come for you before the dawn.
Now, as I was saying...
I haven't the remotest idea what I was saying.
I've been asleep.
I must apologize, Baron.
It must have been the wine.
It's quite all right, Herr Hussman.
Oh, here we are.
It's very late. I hadn't realized we talked so long. I must be leaving.
Well, it's been a swell party, Baron.
We'll save this for next time.
Good night, Baron.
Thank you for your hospitality,
Herr Hussman.
- Not at all. Good night.
- Good night.
Why, Rita, aren't you going to bid me good night?
Good night, Grandfather.
Good night, my dear.
Lampini. Lampini.
- Good night, Baron.
- Good night, sir.
Lampini.
Niemann.
Of course.
Dr. Niemann.
Well, it turned out to be fun after all, didn't it, darling?
It's a wonderful night.
The darkness beckons to me.
Another world.
The world I see is far away, yet very near.
A strange and beautiful world in which one may be dead and yet alive.
Rita, what is it?
What's happened to you?
I'm going away.
Dracula crest.
Like the one on the coffin.
Where did you get it?
From Baron Latos.
Baron Latos?
We've got to get it off.
I want to go there, Carl.
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Connect me with Inspector Arnz. Hurry!
- Hello?
- Hello, Inspector. This is Carl Hussman.
- My grandfather has been killed.
- Herr Hussman?
Wounds on the neck? Want kind of wounds?
Two small punctures like teeth marks.
I'll be right over.
Rita!
Rita! Rita!
Arnz!
Arnz!
Arnz!
My wife, in that carriage.
Master! The police. They're after us.
Look, Master.
I think they're after Dracula.
There's one way to stop them.
Yes.
Aah!
Fejos, the police!
Ah, Herr Inspector, you missed Ilonka's dance.
She's pretty, too.
I will have her dance again especially for you.
Not in the village of
Frankenstein, you won't.
We've had nothing but stealing since you came here.
The Burgomeister says you're to move on.
But, Herr Inspector...
No arguments. Break camp and get out.
All right, the show's over.
Go back to your homes.
Oh, Daniel.
Now drive on.
We'll camp beyond those trees.
What've you got here?
A chamber of horrors.
The Burgomaster won't grant you a permit, so pack up and be on your way.
But why?
There's nothing in my exhibit to offend anyone.
We've had enough horrors around here.
Do you see those ruins?
Our village has been quiet and peaceful since the dam broke and swept the Wolf Man and the Frankenstein monster to their destruction several years ago.
No one ever mentions that place, nor does anyone ever go near it.
That's why you can't exhibit here.
We want nothing to remind us of something that we've been trying to forget.
But we've come a long way and the horses are tired.
It's very late.
Could we at least rest here until tomorrow?
No, you've got to move on.
All right, Daniel, we'll move on.
Hand over the money the villagers gave you.
Only your share.
All of it.
When I joined you, it was agreed that I keep half.
Give me the money.
If you try to rob me,
I'll tell the police that it's you who's been doing the stealing around here!
I'll thrash you within an inch of your life.
Let me go, you smelly pig!
No, Fejos! No! No! No!
No, I say! Fejos!
Daniel! Daniel!
Do you want to bring the police on us?
Go and get him out of here before he kills him.
Master, she's hurt.
May I take her with us?
No, we only have tonight to search for the Frankenstein records.
Please, Master, she's hurt.
All right, if it will keep you in your right senses.
Are you awake?
You've nothing to be afraid of.
Now I remember.
Who are you?
I'm Daniel.
I'm with Professor Lampini's show.
Here, I brought you some tea.
It will make you feel better.
That was nice of you.
Are you the one that helped me?
It made me mad when he whipped you.
But he can't hurt you anymore.
They've gone.
Leaving me a hundred miles from nowhere.
No, but we're going to Visaria.
You can travel with us.
You can sleep here and talk to me when I drive.
I get so lonesome when I have no one to talk to.
You don't know me very well.
I might talk you to death.
Your name's Ilonka, isn't it?
You know all about me, don't you, Daniel?
I watched you dance.
Did you?
Did you like me?
You're pretty.
You're afraid of me, aren't you?
Afraid of you?
If you weren't, you'd come up here where I could see you better.
But you will talk to me sometimes?
Won't you?
Of course I will.
You've been kind to me and I like you.
Daniel. Daniel!
Yes, Master.
You come with me.
I've found a way into the ruins.
Master, if we find the Frankenstein records, will you make me like other men?
To please your little gypsy girl, friend Daniel, I'll make you an Adonis.
Here's a book, Master!
Does it...
Help me, Master!
Daniel, are you hurt?
No, Master.
Evidently the force of the flood burst through that wall and washed everything into the cave beyond.
We'd better look for the records in there.
A glacial ice cavern.
The Wolf Man.
Master, over there!
The undying monster.
The triumphant climax of Frankenstein's genius and the Wolf Man.
They may know where the records are, friend Daniel.
We'll set them free and they will help us.
Master! Master!
Who are you?
Why have you freed me from the ice that imprisoned the beast that lived within me?
Why?
Perhaps to help you, Mr. Talbot.
No earthly power can help those that are marked by the sign of the pentagram.
You came here to ask Frankenstein for help, didn't you?
Yes, but I was too late.
He was dead.
I wanted to die, too.
Nevertheless, when Dr. Mannering trailed you here from England, you asked him for help.
I did, but he became more interested in the monster than he was in me.
When the villagers learned that he had brought the monster back to life, they blew up the darn.
These frozen waters have held you here all these years.
And now you've brought me back to a life of misery.
With each full moon,
I turn into a werewolf.
I kill.
I want to die.
Only death can bring me release.
You don't have to die, my boy. You're wrong.
I can help you.
How? How can you help me?
I, too, am a doctor.
A scientist like Frankenstein.
Do you know where he kept his records?
I think so.
Show me those records and I'll build a new brain for you.
I'll lift this curse from you forever.
He wanted life and strength.
I wanted only death.
Here we are.
The answer to both your problems lies here.
But in my laboratory in Visaria,
I have the equipment to restore his strength.
Then I must wait until we reach Visaria.
You must be patient.
The horses are harnessed, Master.
Can you drive?
Why, yes.
Then take the road to Visaria.
Master, is he going to drive all the time?
Yes, I need you here.
We must apply hot compresses.
The ice has seriously damaged his tissues.
What's the matter, Daniel, you got bugs?
You're not Daniel.
No, Daniel's back with the doctor.
Who are you?
Just the driver.
Are you going to Visaria with us?
Yes.
I promised Daniel I'd keep him company while he drove.
But I'll talk to you if you want me to.
My name's Ilonka. What's yours?
Lawrence.
Lawrence?
Do they call you Larry?
They used to.
Larry! Larry!
I have something for you.
Look.
Pretty.
What's the matter with you?
We've been together three days, and you haven't smiled once.
I think I'd like you better if you smiled.
Now don't start barking at me.
There's a nice big smile for you.
Now give me one.
You see how easy it is?
Then why are you always so sad?
I wish you'd tell me.
Why?
Because I like you.
Tell me. Maybe I can help.
No one could help me.
Daniel?
Hurry up with that water.
You going to stand there all day?
Get started.
We've lost too much time already.
Master, why can't I drive part of the time?
But Talbot bothers me with his everlasting impatience.
We must get the monster to Visaria before further changes make restoration more difficult.
The desiccation of the tissues has gone further than I thought
It's not as bad as I feared.
Our equipment is still usable.
We must go to work and get it in shape as quickly as possible.
Turn on the steam.
Steam will soften the tissues so that the high-frequency current will go through them.
How long will it take?
A day. Perhaps longer.
Why must you do that now?
You have everything you need here.
Operate on me.
I've yet to find a way of combining
Frankenstein's technique with my own.
The moon will be full tonight.
You know what that means.
I can't stand to go through that torture again. I tell you, I can't!
An operation now would be a failure.
It would leave you exactly as you are.
You must wait.
Wait!
All right, Daniel.
Master, Talbot is big and strong.
Will you give me...
Forget Talbot. We have work to do.
But, Master, you promised...
All in due time, Daniel.
Tonight we call on my old friends,
Ullman and Strauss.
Herr Strauss.
Yes. What do you want?
Remember me? I'm Dr. Niemann.
Dr. Niemann?
Yes, Frederick.
Come with me.
Pardon me, Herr Ullman.
Do you know Herr Strauss?
The garrulous gentleman who testified that he saw me take a body from its grave.
We don't forget, Herr Strauss, do we?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is that more comfortable?
Niemann, I've saved 15,000 marks...
Since you testified for the state to save your miserable hide?
Let me go, Niemann.
Let me go and the money is yours.
Every bit of it.
15,000 marks.
A thousand for every year that I spent in the stinking, slimy dungeon.
You bargain poorly, Herr Ullman.
Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't...
Kill my trusted old assistant?
Why, no.
I'm going to repay you for betraying me.
I'm going to give that brain of yours a new home in the skull of the Frankenstein monster.
As for you, Strauss,
I'm going to give you the brain of the Wolf Man so that all your waking hours will be spent in untold agony, awaiting the full of the moon, which will change you into a werewolf.
The plasma must flow at exactly that rate.
No more, no less.
If there's any change, call me.
- Master.
- Yes?
Now that I've helped you with Strauss and Ullman, will you give Talbot's body to me?
What?
He's big. He's strong.
Talbot's body is the perfect home for the monster's brain, which I will add to and subtract from in my experiments.
Master, you made me a promise.
No!
You think I'd wreck the work of a lifetime because you're in love with a gypsy girl?
I've killed four men for you.
Do as I say or I'll never help you.
Larry!
Larry!
Daniel, you frightened me.
Have you seen Larry?
What's the matter? Don't you like Larry?
You used to smile at me sometimes, before he joined us.
Why, Daniel, I believe you're jealous.
You love him, don't you?
He's in some kind of trouble, I think.
I want to help him.
You do love him.
But he doesn't know it.
It wouldn't make any difference to him if he did.
Why not? Why wouldn't it make any difference to him?
Do you see that?
It's a star.
A five-pointed star.
- The pentagram.
- The pentagram!
The sign of the beast.
"Even a man who's pure in heart
"and says his prayers by night..."
"Will become a werewolf when the wolf bane blooms
"and the moon is full and bright."
He's a werewolf.
Oh, no!
No, not him. Not Larry!
You're lying! You're lying to me!
No.
No, I'm trying to protect you.
Stay away from him.
When the moon is full again, he'll turn.
And he'll kill.
He'll kill.
I don't believe you.
You're making it all up because you're jealous.
I hate you.
You're mean and you're ugly!
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!
She hates me because
I'm an ugly hunchback.
If it wasn't for you,
I'd have Talbot's body.
Yes, Mrs. Strauss.
Yes, yes, yes, Mrs. Strauss.
What about our beers, Hoffman?
At once, Herr Burgomeister.
I must go now, Mrs. Strauss. Good day.
I don't know. I don't know.
The housewives, they ask me where their husbands are all the time.
What are you muttering about, Hoffman?
Strauss hasn't been home since yesterday.
His wife's very worried about him.
Sleeping off a drunk probably.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
Ullman hasn't been home since last night either.
Neither has Braun, the storekeeper.
That's odd.
When one man doesn't come home, you think nothing of it.
When three men disappear overnight, particularly in a small town like Visaria, you begin to wonder.
Inspector! I found Herr Braun.
Out in the woods.
- He's dead.
- Dead?
What do you make of it, Doctor?
The jugular vein is severed.
Not cut, but torn apart as though by powerful teeth.
A werewolf!
We'll all be murdered.
Heaven help us.
I must warn my wife and children.
Schwartz, Meier, come back here.
I forbid that you spread such talk.
What do you want to do?
Drive folks from Visaria and ruin our village forever?
I'm ashamed of you, all of you, believing in such idiotic superstitions.
Then how do you explain that?
And how about Strauss?
And Ullman. What happened to them?
If there's a werewolf, our people should know about it.
I think so too, Herr Burgomeister.
Our children aren't safe.
If there's a werewolf, let's find him.
Aye, search for the werewolf!
All right! All right!
Organize your searching parties.
The inspector will head one group,
Schwartz another, and Meier a third.
Find your werewolf.
"Even a man who is pure at heart and says his prayers by night..."
Then you know?
Daniel told me.
Oh, Larry.
Last night, I killed a man.
You didn't know what you were doing.
But I did.
I wanted to kill and I knew that I wanted to.
Tonight the moon will rise again and I'll become that beast.
I'll kill again.
Can't Dr. Niemann do anything for you?
Ask him, Larry. Ask him.
Oh, he says that he can, but he keeps putting me off.
I don't trust him.
I can't go on waiting and killing and waiting.
I...
I want forgetfulness, peace.
I want to help you.
I'll do anything.
When that spell comes over me,
I'd kill anyone.
I won't let you.
I won't let you out of my sight.
I might even kill you.
I couldn't help myself.
I'm not afraid.
It's no use, Ilonka.
Only death can bring us peace of mind.
And a werewolf doesn't just die.
He must be killed.
Killed by a silver bullet.
Fired by the hand of one who loves him enough to understand.
He must be killed.
Killed by a silver bullet.
Fired by the hand of someone who loves him enough to understand.
Turbines.
Now the generator.
Check the megavoltage.
Twenty-five thousand.
Increase to 50.
The electronic bombardment will penetrate...
Listen to me, Niemann.
You promised that if I found the Frankenstein records, you'd cure me of this curse.
I found them, gave them to you.
Now it's time for you to keep your part of the bargain.
My boy, you must have patience.
I've waited long enough.
Last night I suffered the tortures of the damned.
I killed a man.
Tonight the moon will be full again.
Now you stop whatever you're doing and operate on me or I swear, I'll...
Would you destroy your only hope of release?
Well, any sign of your werewolf yet?
We're early for him, I guess.
Oh, so he appears on schedule like a train, is that it?
Increase your megavoltage to 100,000.
Danger, Master! Danger, Master!
Danger!
Decrease!
Hello, Schwartz! Ja, come here quick!
What's the matter? What is it?
Lights at Dr. Niemann's.
Weird lights. Flashing all over the old place.
- At Dr. Niemann's?
- Yeah, we saw them from the road.
His place has been closed for 15 years.
We better investigate.
Larry?
Go away.
No, Larry, let me in!
Go away, I tell you.
Tell Talbot I'm ready for him.
Master.
Master.
The Wolf Man.
The only thing I ever loved.
It wouldn't have happened if you kept faith with me.
I served you well, Master.
Remember Lampini? Strauss?
Ullman?
Now you're going to join them.
Aaah!
Search the castle and grounds.
The Frankenstein monster!
The Frankenstein monster!
Can't stand fire.
Aah!
Set fire to the marsh grass.
Drive him back into the bog.
Don't go this way. Quicksands! Quicksands!
Not this way. Quicksands!
Not that way. Quicksands! Quicksands!

Moscow, 1947
The Little Humpbacked Horse
Director
I. Vano
Past the woods and mountains steep,
Past the rolling waters deep,
Where the skies black earth behold,
Lived a peasant weak and old.
Of his sons, and he had three
Eldest sharp was as could be.
Second was nor dull nor bright,
But the third, a fool all right.
But, upon an evil day,
Dire misfortune came their way,
Someone, when the day was through
Took to trampling wheat they grew.
Day and night they sat and thought
How the villain could be caught.
Till at last they understood
Nightly guard would do them good.
You, Ivan just go around.
Watch the field and space abound.
We'll lay low and watch this spot,
Soon the loathsome thief be caught!
Stars, stars... one, two, three...
All night long, I count thee
Four, five, six and... there's seven!
Fingers ten can't count all heaven!
If you will set me free,
Two brave stallions I would give thee
And such handsome steeds I'd bear
As have ne'er been seen, I swear.
If you wish, why, sell the two,
But part not with the little steed!
Faithful friend to you he'll be,
Where you go, on land or sea.
So, farewell!
I will roam free...
But not in our field!
Log house, stove… all swing around, ain’t no place for the master to lay down.
Where in this hangover dread,
Shall I hide my rowdy head?
Don’t you worry ‘bout the boot,
Hey, stomp with your foot.
Drunks “knee-deep” all seas shall measure,
But their heads they do not treasure.
Heavens! Look what lovely pair, our young fool has hidden there!
Oh, the field, the field of mine
Roaming free just feels so fine!
Roaming free just feels... Hugh?!
Oh, my horses black as night,
With your golden manes so bright!
Did not I look after you?
What foul devil stole you? Who?
Don’t blame devils for their deeds, your two brothers stole those steeds!
Yes, your loss is great, I know
But I'll help you in your woe.
Mount my back-when I say: 'Go',
Hold to me for all you know!
What a wonder, like a flame!
Look, there's light in plenty here,
But no smoke or heat, I swear!
And you very well may stare!
That's a Fire-Bird's feather there!
But, for your own sake,
Touch it not, for in its wake.
Many sorrows, many woes,
Follow everywhere it goes.
That is not a truth,
I am not such a fool!
Many sorrows, many woes
Follow everywhere it goes.
Honest masters, come this way!
See what wares we have today!
Foxes, ferrets… different furs!
Saddles and some horsewhips sound!
Tawed reins!
Honey cakes!
Spiced brine apples!
Savor all my gingerbreads!
Tsar’s approaching!
Redhead chamberlain ‘side him,
He’s horse keepers’ chief supreme.
What a sight they’re to behold
Just to me, you will be sold!
Who's the owner?
My good people, who...
Owns these handsome chargers two?
Tsar, these steeds belong to me,
I'm their owner, too, you see.
Well, I wish to buy the team.
Would you sell them to me?
No, I'm swapping them.
What will you be taking, then?
Two times five fistfuls of silver.
Two times five...? Ten.
Ten!
Oh, um...
Well...
Shake hands!
Hey, you! Bring the treasury!
Whatcha looking at, old snake?
Take the steeds, for goodness sake!
Oh, brothers, what a show!
I could die just laughing so!
Now, my grooms can't hold those two,
So, there's nothing else to do.
You come and serve to me,
I'll pay with gold to thee!
Make you Master of my Horse,
Like a lord, you'll live, of course.
What a wonder!
Let it be!
I shall serve Your Majesty!
Have I fallen from your grace?
And my job which I embrace?
My displeasure, do observe!
Under Ivan you shall serve!
Take them, Ivan, faithful slave
To my stable, steeds so brave!
Just you wait, you dirty lout,
Time will come, I'll turn you out.
Tsar’s Stables
Servant life is sloth and folly
Chasing pigeons - he is jolly.
Steeds well-fed and clean appear
Could some ghost be working here?
Can it be, a goblin sprite
Comes and braids their manes at night?
Spy on him - that's what I shall do.
And won’t stop until I’m through!
I’ll your silky bangs unbraid
With a fine-toothed comb inlaid
Brush your manes and braid 'em back
And admire your beauty black.
Oh you, skipping horses mine
You are graceful, you are fine!
But the heart perceives most dear
My humpback that’s always near.
This shall be your bitter end,
To the gallows you’ll be sent.
All the Court knows it is true,
What Ivan conceals from you.
Tisn't silver, tisn't gold,
Fire-Bird's feather, Sire…Behold!
And he boasts, as I've heard,
That, did you but say the word,
He could bring the Bird of Fire,
To your Royal Chamber, Sire.
Hey, fetch for me that foolish lad!
Won’t escape my fist-too bad!
By what law and what decree
Have you from Our Majesty
Hidden what is ours by right?
Yes, the Fire-Bird's feather bright?
Pardon me this once, please do
And I'll lie no more to you.
You'll be pardoned for the nonce,
Seeing you have sinned but once.
You have boasted, as I've heard,
That, did I but say the word,
You could bring the Bird of Fire
To the Chamber of your Sire.
May the lightning strike my head if such thing I ever said!
If you do not bring the Bird of Fire,
To my Royal Chamber, now,
By my Royal Beard I vow,
I will find you anywhere!
I'll destroy you! Get out!
Slave!
Yes, cry now!
You rejected my advice, now, you have to pay the price.
Oh, whatever shall I do?
Help me, oh my friend so true.
It is not an easy deed, but together we'll succeed!
So, listen to me well!
Telling you in language plain,
We will need the best of grain,
And two troughs; then, if you please,
Wine, brought in from overseas.
Really, we’ve no time to waste.
And at dawn we must make haste.
Ivan’s gone long time from here.
Somewhere lies he drunk, I fear.
Let you down this time, I think,
Broke decrees and did not blink.
Were he empty-handed to arrive
I would have to skin the fool alive.
I am twisting little rope
Lovingly, kid’s noose I grope
He shall test the strength of threads.
Soon, I’ll finish with my noose
Insult’s gone when he’ll hang loose.
Vile hound, snout of swine!
May you bow-like twist your spine!
May you choke on birch bark shoe!
May you fall the black earth through!
What have you brought back for me?
Show me! Patience’s not my trait.
Father Tsar, a moment’s wait!
Shut the chamber casement tight,
Draw the shades, keep out the light.
Hey, boyars! You should make haste need day with night replaced!
Oh how lively you do leap
Come enjoy your peaceful keep!
Vanya, friend, I love you so,
Lightened is my heart, you know.
And, in token of my joy,
Be my Royal Groom, my boy!
You won't always prosper so,
Have such foolish luck, oh no!
I'll get you in trouble, yet!
Yes, I will, my little pet!
In a distant German lands,
Flows an ocean, like no others;
And it washes foreign shores,
And it's sailed by merchant moors.
Sailors tell about a maiden fair,
Living on that ocean there.
She's no common maiden, see
Daughter to the Sun is she,
Moon’s her brother, goes the word
Scarlet dress she wears...
I'll get you in trouble, yet!
Yes, I will, my little pet!
SAUNA
Get him, get him get him clean
Front and back and in between
Birch twig switch of leafy green
One, two-water off duck’s back is dripping
Good health comes from all this whipping.
And will be our Father mild
Rosy red like tender child
From the waters boiling wild.
One, two-water off duck’s back is dripping
Good health comes from all this whipping.
One, two-water off duck’s back is dripping
Good health comes from all this whipping.
Tsar, your Vanya gaily said,
Swearing by your Royal Head,
That he knew this birdie -yes-
So he called her, I confess.
And, O Sire, it's also true
That he bragged to catch her, too.
I have been informed, dear Vanya,
That just now, my lad, you said,
Swearing by my Royal Head,
That, did I but say the word,
You could bring another bird.
For your Monarch, you did swear, you could catch the Tsar-Maid Fair.
My Tsar, that's not true.
Someone has been lying to you.
What! You don't want to obey?
Listen to me, my lad...
If you do not bring to me
That Tsar-Maid, in short weeks three,
To my Chamber, lovely bird,
Mark, Ivan, my royal word,
You’ll be pulled apart in pieces!
In this lovely silky tent
I my loneliness lament
And for no-one my voice sings
As I nod and pluck my strings.
Oh dear Tsar, it’s time to sing
Since Tsar-Maiden he won’t bring
Serf has played another trick
Drive him in a coffin thick.
Peerless, beautiful princess,
Be my bride! Agree - say yes!
Oh! Your lovely eyes so bright
They will haunt me day and night!
They will torture me by day,
And at nights, drive sleep away!
Say but one sweet word to me
Everything is ready, see.
And tomorrow, oh my life,
We'll be wedded man and wife.
I will never marry you!
Old man and toothless, too!
I may be old, yet I’m lively and I’m bold.
I would marry you only if you're still young.
But I love you more than life!
Why can you not be my wife?
You regain your youth anew,
And I'll gladly marry you.
Listen, early in the morn,
On the palace court-yard lawn,
You must have put on three cauldrons ready,
Two-on fires burning steady.
Now, the first one must be filled
To the brim, with water chilled,
While the next - with water hot.
Then, with milk fill up the last,
Heat it, till the milk boils fast.
If you want to marry me,
Young and handsome wish to be,
First you must your robes divest,
Plunge into the milk, undressed.
Next, in boiling water. Then,
In the water cold - and when
You emerge - Oh, Father my,
You’ll be young and handsome guy.
Oh, dear Father, don’t get sad,
Try this trick on our lad.
Cauldrons' magic he should test
If it works, then be my guest.
Tomorrow morn, on the palace court-yard lawn,
You, Ivan, must do your best
These three cauldrons you must test.
First bathe in the milk, my son,
Then the waters, one by one.
But I'll be boiled alive!
Chickens, pigs, and turkeys -yes-
People scald them, I confess.
I could bath in cold water, yeah, but in boiling water - no way!
What? You defy to me?
Put him under lock and key!
Talk like this, you getting then
Bread and water regimen!
First you do the cauldron bit
Then we’ll talk about it.
If we only never met.
Woes to you, I do regret.
Tsar will be the death of me.
He’ll be boiling me, you see.
God bless you and do not cry.
We will manage, you and I.
I would sooner perish, than leave you in the lurch, Ivan.
Say to Tsar: Your Gracious Majesty!
Please to send my horse to me,
So that I can say good-bye
To my horse before I die.
Tsar will agree, you'll see.
Now, sleep in peace and forget your cares.
Now, undress yourself, my man
Try the cauldrons best you can.
Oh, allow Your Majesty,
Please to send my horse to me
So that I can say good-bye before I die.
If the milk doesn't boil proper, water one will be his stopper.
Why are you just staying still?
Wait’s been long, now do my will!

-THE END-
THE DEVIL'S ENVOYS
Translation for KG by rentboy
And so in this lovely month of May 1485
His Lordship the Devil dispatched to earth two of his creatures to bring despair to humanity...
(15th Century French legend)
There.
Say, my good man...
Do you think the lord of this domain could welcome two minstrels come from far away to entertain him?
I believe so.
I'd even say your timing is perfect.
Baron Hugues loves music and we are soon marrying
Lady Anne to Sir Renaud.
Since the engagement, one feast has followed another.
And when there are feasts they hardly need our services.
So I fish to pass the time.
Thank you, good man.
Thank you, lovely children.
Thank you for calling me "good man."
Say what you will, it's still a pleasure to hear.
Come on, frogs.
Little frogs, come on.
Make up your minds.
The executioner scares you?
Then let yourselves be caught by the "good man."
My lords.
Kind sirs.
What sadness lies in my heart!
An animal that was harming no one.
An animal that made everyone in the castle laugh.
He was peacefully crossing the courtyard and the guards killed him with an arrow... just for fun.
This is all I have left of him.
He's dead.
Kind sirs.
My brother.
What shall become of me?
What misery!
What's the use, Gilles?
It still amuses me to do good once in a while.
What's the use, Gilles?
Those players bore me and make me sleepy
I hope these will be diverting.
You're very hard to please, Renaud.
That juggler was very amusing.
This man looks very sad.
Father, don't you think he has a sad face?
Do you want to send him away?
I wouldn't want to hurt him.
With a face like that, it would be a shame.
Well said, Renaud.
His sunken face makes me hungry.
Stand up and show us what you can do.
Nothing myself, noble lord.
I came to show you three little creatures the likes of which can't be found anywhere.
Few are those who've seen them.
The common people are simple and easily frightened.
Only the great can truly appreciate nature's oddities.
You're too delicate, Anne.
Look at them.
I assure you they're hilarious.
I don't want to.
Look at them. Just a little bit.
To make me happy.
And then look at me.
You'll find me even more pleasing.
I don't want to look at them.
I feel sad and sorry for them.
Take them away.
I don't want you to be sad.
I arranged these festivities to make you happy.
You think you're beautiful enough to mock others?
I know I'm not beautiful. You should still find me pretty, compared to them.
My daughter would now like to hear those lovely things that speak to the heart those beautiful love stories that appeal to simple dreamers.
Is there no one here who can sing?
Demons and marvels
Winds and tides
The sea retires afar
And you like an alga
Softly caressed by the wind
In the sand bed
Swaying as you dream
Demons and marvels
Winds and tides
The sea retires afar
But in your eyes ajar
Two little waves remain
Demons and marvels
Winds and tides
Two little waves
To cover me.
You sing well, young man.
Who are you?
My name is Gilles.
And my brother is Dominique.
Sing us another song.
Love's face, tender and dangerous
Came to me one night
After a day too long.
Perhaps it was an archer with a bow
Or perhaps a player with a harp
I know not
I know nothing
I know only
He wounded me
Perhaps with an arrow
Perhaps with a song
I know only
He touched me
He touched me
Wounded my heart forever.
Burning, o burning
Wound of love.
Love, always love, and then more love.
With its little pleas and its great torts.
Once we sang of war, of the hunt of the pleasures of combat, of the kill.
You're harsh, Renaud.
Perhaps I didn't love Baroness Berthe as in the songs.
But I was very fond of her.
Very fond.
My poor wife died.
And the times have changed.
Now everyone speaks of love.
Too much so.
I don't care for it.
You seem well pleased with yourself.
You dare to look a lady in the eye while cooing ridiculous platitudes.
Please, Renaud.
If you were swinging from a rope with a noose around your throat, would you sing as well?
I don't think so.
Then sing no more if you care to hold on to this pathetic thing you call a life.
You seem preoccupied, Anne.
Are you sad because earlier
I spoke too casually of love?
No, my dear.
I don't hold it against you.
I too danced while Berthe still lived.
My little creatures are sleepy.
Where can I put them to sleep?
Come, I'll show you the room reserved for the acrobats.
- What is on your mind, Anne?
- Nothing, my dear.
Who is on your mind, then?
- Have I ever given you cause to be jealous?
- Happily, no.
I simply wanted to remind you that you will soon be all mine.
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you, Renaud.
All your pleasures, desires, and sorrows, should you have any you will owe to me.
Will I at least be allowed to dream?
As little as possible, for my sake.
Dreams are harmful, useless things.
I never dream.
The moment I saw you
I knew why I came from so far
And I thanked heaven for leading me to you.
The moment I saw you
I knew you had come for me.
I knew, oh, I'm so certain, my life was about to change.
Do you regret it?
No.
Will you regret it?
Never.
- Even if I should suffer.
- Those who love don't suffer.
Look at them.
Do they suffer?
No.
They are wonderfully alone alone with the moon shining on their love.
And these two gazing at the stars
What are they thinking of?
Nothing.
Not even of the stars they look upon.
They're together.
In love.
They're happy.
And him, over there, all alone so sad and forlorn
Surely the one he loved has left him, or perhaps he did.
And so the moon, the stars the birds, these trees nothing exists for him.
He hears nothing, sees nothing.
He's all alone.
His love is gone.
I too would despair if one day
I could no longer see you
Like him.
Guillaume l'Agneau, my page, with little Agnès?
- I didn't know they were in love.
- They're not in love.
They're playing.
Playing with love.
Here's the one who truly loves
Guillaume l'Agneau.
Louison?
She's hiding, looking at them.
She wants to cry.
She's ugly, unloved.
Why is she ugly? She loves him.
That's not fair.
And that makes me sad too.
I don't want you to be sad tonight.
How pretty she is now.
It's nothing.
- The Devil's beauty.
- I don't believe in the Devil.
You are lucky.
My name is Anne.
You are the most wonderful creature
I have ever met.
I'm happy, Gilles.
I shall never forget you.
Even if I was dreaming now
I would wish never to awake.
- Why do you laugh?
- Isn't this funny?
You barely know me and already you say you love me.
Time is immaterial.
I love you. It is what it is.
I love you.
How can I believe it?
Earlier, you had only hatred and contempt for love.
Earlier... was a long time ago.
Now you're near me.
Only that matters.
I am as if in a dream.
Where do you come from?
Who are you?
Who I am?
You said it.
A woman who's here, near you close to you.
Come, Anne.
Renaud... with another woman!?
The moment I saw you
I knew why I came from so far
And I thanked heaven for leading me to you.
But alas, soon I must leave.
I don't want you to leave.
Take this ring, Renaud.
And if we're apart keep it always in memory of me.
You seem preoccupied, Anne.
And you seem distracted, Renaud.
Who gave you this necklace?
Who gave you this ring?
What a pitiful figure you cut, Gilles.
Gilles and Dominique,
Dominique and Gilles
the Devil is kind to his children when they are very obedient.
Remember it, remember it.
What is written is written.
You signed with him.
Gilles and Dominique,
Dominique and Gilles
who pretended to love.
Remember it, remember it.
You must continue.
It is your destiny
to seduce, corrupt and ruin, and to abandon in despair
those who listened to you.
The monsters
Always the monsters
We won't sleep tonight.
You had intended to sleep?
- You shouldn't laugh, Dominique.
- Why not?
What if I wanted to have some fun?
What's the harm?
You didn't often give me reason to laugh...
- back when we lived together.
- Be quiet.
Why stir up those dead things?
Who killed them?
Did I?
Did you?
Or both of us?
Who killed at birth a new love full of mirth?
Enough!
You know very well there was never real love between us.
Perhaps we had lived too much before we knew each other
- ... simulated love too long
- Be quiet.
Why?
Are you feeling remorse?
Remorse!
Too bad. They say remorse makes the time go by faster.
Having some might make my life easier, don't you think?
But why would have I any?
Men have loved me, as they say in their fancy tongue.
I let them.
Is it my fault they would cry and give up everything for me?
Even their life?
The young ones were full of ardor.
The old ones dragged at my feet.
Did you see me cry, throw myself at your feet?
You were different.
Hungry, unbending, proud.
You only wanted to be loved to take everything and give nothing...
- keep everything, and leave.
- Like you, Dominique?
You watched me like a cat watches a mouse.
But the cat finds in front of him another cat. Not a mouse.
It's not our fault. We both thought we had found a ripe, new victim.
Two executioners face to face.
No one to torture.
- How sad.
- Enough!
If you had truly loved me
I might have loved you.
If you had loved me
I too might have loved you...
- perhaps...
- Dominique!
Yes...
Frighten me... hit me... kill me... cut my throat...
My dear love.
What's the use of all this?
What's signed is signed.
Are we not happy?
Others love us.
They suffer for us.
We watch them.
We leave.
A nice trip.
The Devil pays the way.
Good night, Gilles.
You don't ask where I'm going?
I know where.
And you, where will you spend the night?
Obviously.
It would be a shame to disturb her dreams.
Best to speak of love during the day to such fresh creatures.
Baron Hugues!
Why are you here so late, young man?
By what right do you knock at my door?
I don't know. A sudden impulse.
You mustn't be angry with me even if you can't understand.
Grave dangers threaten me.
I feel so alone, so helpless.
Put your hand on my heart and feel how it beats.
Yes, alas.
I am a woman.
Weakness itself.
Only you know my secret.
The moment I saw you
I knew why I came from so far
And I thanked heaven for leading me to you.
Who are you?
Where are you from?
I left everything to escape a dark, hopeless fate.
But... I'm still confused.
I need help and advice.
How can I help you?
I who live inside myself.
In the past.
In my memories.
One should not live in memories.
I try to forget everything.
Alas, my brother is only a brother.
And I feel so alone.
So do I, my child.
My taste for life abandoned me with my wife's death.
- How you must have loved her.
- Yes.
- We loved each other.
- Love is a beautiful thing.
It's all so far away.
I'm old now.
You mustn't say that.
Youthfulness of heart is the only youth.
She's in her bed.
She sleeps. She dreams.
In her dream, she's yours.
You must keep her waiting.
The longer she waits, the more she will love you.
The more she will love you, the more she will suffer.
What do you want of me, Renaud, now that I have confided in you?
What I want?
Why such a question?
What I want...
You are what I want, all of you.
And you know it.
Such rough language.
I'm sorry to offend you.
I may not know how to speak to women...
But I always speak my mind.
I said, your language was rough.
But I didn't say I was offended.
So many so-called men think weeping is the way to win a maiden's heart.
And you said you didn't know how to speak to women!
Listening to you, who could believe you were about to marry?
Leave my marriage alone.
You're very cruel to remind me.
Is it true the custom here is to prepare the wedding chamber and to leave it open to all comers long before the wedding day?
It is true.
That is the custom.
Lovely tradition.
I would very much like to see this chamber.
It's truly remarkable.
The room that will host two young lovers destined to each other.
Be quiet.
Everything here radiates peace... happiness...
Peace... happiness...
Since I met you it means nothing it no longer means anything peace, happiness.
It's a shame to wake up good Christians so early when they're comfortably in bed.
- One is never comfortable alone in bed.
- That was up to you, Olivier...
The castle doesn't want for pretty girls.
Here, have a look.
And my heart is yours...
Won't we have the joy of seeing Mlle Anne, Baron Hugues?
I think not.
My daughter cares little for hunting.
You seem distracted.
Did you sleep poorly?
Alas, I've been a stranger to sleep for a long time now.
I'm sorry for you. Aren't nights made for sleeping?
Did you sleep well, Lady?
I had a wonderful night.
Don't be so glum.
We'll have a great day.
I have an idea. Why not invite along those two players whose songs pleased you so.
Last night, you didn't seem very fond of them.
I admit when I'm wrong.
Let's take them along.
Agnès...
Agnès...
Dress me quickly!
How good of you to come along.
A most pleasant surprise.
Shouldn't all your pleasures also become mine now?
I hope you also know some good hunting songs.
We have songs to suit all hours of the day and night, kind sir.
Don't you find, Baron Hugues, that this minstrel has an odd voice?
He's young. He laughs like a child.
This hunt is so sad.
I do so like birds.
Have no fear, Anne. I promise you that none of these birds will be taken today.
Birds are also my friends.
That's odd.
You're calm and fearless in the face of things that surprise others... make them anxious.
Why should I be anxious?
Isn't life full of unknowable things?
Birds...
Fruit...
An animal...
The sun...
The trees in this forest...
And we, who know not where we come from, or where we're going...
Isn't it all wonderful?
This water is so sweet.
Your lips too are sweet.
I love you, Anne.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I was so happy... and I suddenly thought of Renaud.
He too said, "I love you, Anne" with the same hard expression and the same voice he would say,
I love my dogs, I love to hunt,
I love killing anything that flies or runs.
I love you, Anne.
And you're mine forever... forever.
Is it really possible for one being to belong completely to another?
Some call that, love.
Then... love is like death.
One no longer exists. All is finished.
Why?
Since you love me, don't make me suffer.
Don't keep me captive.
Let me live.
Love me as I love you... simply.
But that's not possible.
What would your daughter and Sir Renaud say?
They'll say nothing.
They have nothing to say.
When I speak, people listen and keep quiet.
I demand it...
I demand that you shed this sad masculine garb.
- Right here?
- Don't say that.
Very well, my lord.
I listen and I keep quiet.
Don't laugh, Dominique.
I want everyone to bow before you and be stunned by your beauty when you wear a dress.
To be seen wearing... a dress?
Is that all you desire?
Why do you tease a man who has his whole life already behind him?
Are you then like ivy, bound by your memories?
Please...
Are you so unfeeling?
Do you want to make me unhappy?
I?
Make you unhappy?
When your presence has made me feel twenty years younger?
It's true, I'm not the same man.
- Why hold it against me?
- I hold nothing against you, dear child.
I was looking for you.
I lost track of the hunt.
You too, no doubt.
Obviously, you can't understand, Renaud.
But...
Dominique is a woman.
- Really?
- Really.
She is in grave danger, and has asked for my protection.
Now you and I alone know her secret.
Really?
Really.
Here are our friends.
I think it's time to rejoin them.
What game are you playing?
- What do you mean?
- He was at your feet, kissing your hands.
Do you think me unworthy of such a tribute?
Women like attention.
Where's the harm?
Come on, I'm joking.
Baron Hugues was suspicious.
He questioned me. I answered.
- That's all.
- Is that all?
Are you jealous of an old man?
Jealous? I?
Now do you believe that one being can belong completely to another... and not be unhappy?
I am happy.
And you, Gilles?
Me?
Why should I be happy?
Because I'm here, close to you?
Because I held you in my arms?
All that...
It brings me so much happiness.
Happiness.
What a bore.
Really now...
A single thought in such a lovely head.
A single thought, always the same.
Happiness.
How absurd... sad... monotonous... tedious.
- But, Gilles...
- Gilles!
Gilles what?
What do you want with Gilles?
What does "Gilles" mean?
Do you even know if my name is really Gilles?
I beg you.
- Don't laugh like that. It's so sad.
- Why?
Would you prefer I dissolve into tears?
That I wallow at your feet because you love me?
I love you and I know you love me too.
Listen to this carefully.
Anne, my dear...
I don't love you.
Be quiet.
This is not possible.
- You don't know what you're saying.
- Please, don't make such a sad face.
Is it my fault if I've never loved anyone?
- Be quiet.
- Come now...
This isn't worth crying over...
Just poor stories concocted by the Devil to distract himself.
Trust me...
No one loves anyone.
Everyone pretends, spies, sets traps.
Happiness, since you believe in it... was perhaps for you to escape these traps.
You're leaving?
Yes.
If you knew how much I love you... you would have no choice but to love me.
I wanted the truth to be known.
Until now, only Renaud and I knew of this.
A woman!?
Please admit, Baron, that this young singer's voice did strike me as odd.
They are not just minstrels.
They are from a noble family and must be treated accordingly.
Tonight they dine at my table, and tomorrow
I shall wear their colors at the tournament.
Well said.
Yes, indeed.
Well said.
An odd story, no?
- You didn't know it?
- No.
The young man didn't tell it to you this afternoon, in the forest?
This young woman...
What was she telling you last night, in the garden?
During the time our guests are here...
I'm counting on you to make their stay pleasant.
It will be easy since they themselves know how to entertain us.
Come, Renaud...
Why this bad mood?
And why, Baron, have you so suddenly found your taste for life?
Is it possible, Gilles, that Dominique could really be your sister?
What an innocent question.
Answer me.
If Dominique was my sister... do you think I'd waste my time and leisure traveling the roads with her?
You love her.
To be perfectly honest...
It's my only love.
Why take pleasure in my suffering?
Why?
I knew you loved me.
Alas...
We're under a spell.
Once it lifts...
You will see me as I am... pitiful... and alone.
But I love you.
I belong to the Devil.
I'm one of his friends.
If you love me... it is perhaps thanks to him.
Why torture yourself?
I thought myself lost and alone on earth.
But since I found you...
I'm even more lost, alone, and hopeless.
You are all the love in the world.
And I can only bring you misfortune and despair.
Take me in your arms.
Tell me again you love me.
Anne, so simple... so young... so fresh and alive...
Protect me.
Teach me to live.
Before I met you,
I always pretended.
My heart was frozen.
My love...
Be still and happy.
My body is next to yours.
Your heat beats against mine.
One body...
One heart...
Nothing can keep us apart.
I love you.
And no one,  you hear me...
No one can stop me from loving you.
- What strange weather suddenly.
- True. It was so nice just now.
Why haven't you moved your knight, Renaud?
Too late. I've made my move.
What is it?
A gentleman, lost and surprised by the storm, is requesting shelter for tonight.
Excuse me. I must go welcome this unexpected visitor.
I am touched by this honor you do me.
Make yourself at home.
I thank you.
- You must come from far.
- Oh, very far.
I do travel a great deal...
This storm caught me off guard.
It's not that I fear lightning.
But I was about to get a good soaking.
Which is rather unpleasant.
Oh, the lovely fire!
I do so like fire.
It likes me too.
See how solicitous the flames are?
They lick my fingers like a puppy.
That's nice.
Forgive me.
I didn't introduce myself.
Though my name and titles wouldn't mean much to you.
I'm from so far away.
Forgotten in his homeland, unknown elsewhere... thus is the traveler's fate.
I'm truly delighted to find myself in such charming company.
- I hope you'll deign to share our meal.
- Very gladly.
Did I interrupt your game?
No matter. My defeat was a foregone conclusion.
Don't speak.
Checkmate.
You won.
Chess is so simple.
I didn't know your daughter was marrying.
I'm truly sorry to disturb a family gathering.
I hope your fiancée won't mind this interruption.
But Dominique is not my fiancée.
No...
You make such a lovely couple.
Don't you think so?
What's surprising is that you look a lot like one of my daughters.
I'm flattered.
- You have daughters?
- Yes.
I have many children.
Boys and girls.
I have a preference for the girls.
Especially the one who looks like you.
I prefer girls. Boys are ungrateful, forgetful of their duties... quick to disobey.
I'm not mean, of course, but I detest...
I really detest being disobeyed.
We all have our whims.
Tell me, Baron, where is your daughter?
Won't we see her tonight?
I'm afraid not.
She retired early, slightly indisposed.
- I suspect on a whim.
- Already? Really?
But it's so sad to leave her alone in her room... with her whim...
Pity. I would be so delighted to meet her.
You who look like my favorite daughter, help me convince them to... go fetch the sweet fiancée.
Please, Baron Hugues, to make me happy...
What wouldn't I do to make you happy?
Come, Renaud. You'll talk to her.
Why are you laughing?
Why?
How odd!
You laugh and you don't know why.
Perhaps you laughed only... because one must laugh a little, from time to time, to feel better.
But surely you also laughed because you have a premonition you are headed towards events that are terribly sad.
Alas, even the best among us rejoice at the misfortune of others.
What can you do?
It's human.
But you wouldn't have dared to laugh if I hadn't laughed first, would you?
Don't be surprised
I have the gift of clairvoyance.
I only use it to do good.
It's not necessary to look through a keyhole to see, to know what goes on in a man's heart, or a lady's bedroom.
A young lady is to marry one man, but loves another.
A common story.
He meets her in her bedroom, but is discovered there.
How sad.
They're found together.
So what happens?
The suitor is struck in the face, beaten, and delivered to the guards.
He's pushed down the stairs.
He trips, falls, gets up again only to be beaten down again.
This man shamelessly abused my hospitality.
He shall be punished.
- You called, sir?
- This man is a dog.
I want him treated accordingly.
Take him to the kennel and chain him to his fellow beasts.
For now.
How can I ever forgive you for such behavior?
Take him.
And you, kind sir will you hold the brother's sins against the sister?
Dominique, my heart is deeply wounded.
I share your pain, dear sir.
Forgive me. I scarcely know you, but I'm sorry to see you in this state.
Come, let's take a stroll in the garden.
The night air will do you both good.
I don't know, but... that man really scares me.
Yes, I'm pleased you're not holding this young woman responsible for her brother's unfortunate conduct.
That's the sign of a generous soul and of a gallant heart.
She's fortunate to have found here all the affection she deserves, no?
- We love her very much.
- Indeed.
- She's worthy of all regards.
- And even of love, I should say...
No?
What a lovely ring you have.
May I?
I love jewelry.
Such marvelous workmanship.
Do you realize?
Take a look.
And this initial... this "D"... look how finely engraved it is... this "D".
No?
Who are you?
How did you get in here?
I am the Devil.
- Oh, what do I care?
- What?
Don't you understand?
I am the Devil.
Yes, the Devil who is everywhere at once.
Everywhere.
For example... in the garden...
So what if I loved Dominique?
If Dominique loved me, what could you do?
- Nothing, absolutely nothing.
- Please, why so violent?
What's so extraordinary?
Even as I'm shuttered here am I not also in a forest, near a fountain where the one I love held me in his arms for the first time?
You speak like a child, because you don't know my powers.
Behold.
You're simply jealous.
- Jealous?
- Yes. It's so obvious.
Dominique, what can I do for you?
You're always nearby, clinging to her dress, doting on her.
Oh, sure, you smile like a father, but your eyes can't hide your desire.
You, cur!
The cur is the fool who's begging for love at an age where women have lost interest.
That was ill advised.
Please, gentlemen. You're not about to kill yourselves here in this garden under your daughter's window.
You're right.
- In tomorrow's tournament, let's use...
- Real weapons!
Good idea.
In case of a fatality, you can always say it was a tragic accident.
- That's horrible.
- No, no.
Nothing will happen to your father.
I'll make sure of it.
Leave me.
I am not listening to you.
For me, you don't exist.
For you, perhaps.
But what about others...?
What about Gilles, for example?
What about this poor, unhappy Gilles?
Be quiet.
Gilles is no longer unhappy.
Gilles will never again be unhappy since we love each other.
Cheer up, Gilles.
I hear you're not unhappy.
You're trussed up like an animal.
Soon, the executioner will come to pull out your nails, fill you up with water, to sew up your eyelids carefully, to break your bones a bit...
All that, naturally, without even disturbing your happiness, the shining happiness you owe to love.
It's true.
I am happy.
Poor fool. You thought you'd get away with this?
That would be too easy.
Have you forgotten that those you possess even once must be mine forever?
Do with me as you will.
But Anne belongs to no one.
She's free.
You're powerless against her.
You want to keep her all to yourself?
Maybe even forever?
My poor Gilles.
Look where you've ended.
You were such a bright boy.
Here you are, caught in love's deplorable snares.
You should know better.
How about an example?
They abound around here.
Listen.
Can't you hear Baron Hugues sneaking around corridors?
Forgive me.
I was passing by.
I was returning to my bedroom after a stroll in the garden.
Beautiful night.
No?
I couldn't fall asleep.
So I got up.
I was just walking around.
Oh I understand.
I always sleep like a baby.
But I feel sorry for those who struggle to sleep.
Again, forgive me.
But I'm very sleepy.
Good night.
I thank you for not keeping the sad truth from me.
But now I'm deeply worried and I fear losing you.
Believe me, my dear, violent death is a quick and very simple matter.
There's little time to suffer, and even less time to think.
I admire you for speaking of death so lightly.
I'm not speaking of mine.
You know that since I met you
I have, on the contrary, a furious, passionate wish to live.
To live with you.
With me.
Near me.
Against me.
Forever.
By striking me in the face, Baron Hugues wiped out all the respect I had for him.
Tomorrow, after the fight, the two of us will leave here.
Really?
You would give up everything to follow me?
Do you think I'd stay here once the Baron is dead?
With Anne?
And why not also with your admirable brother who'd come around at night to mew his love beneath our windows?
Please don't talk about Gilles.
I'm already worried enough about you... about your life.
Have no fear.
My life will not be in danger.
See how fine this chain mail is.
This coat of mail is from Italy.
You won't find one hereabouts as lovely or as secure.
With that and a little luck
I'm safe from the fiercest blows.
Avoiding all risks is an unusual way to prove your love.
Don't you see I'm only doing this to reassure you?
If you'd prefer, I'm ready to fight bare-chested.
I fear neither man nor the Devil... nor death.
Not the Devil, nor death?
I do so like you... so sure of yourself, so impressive.
Wear this tomorrow under your doublet.
It will remind you of my warm body as you fight to keep it.
My love, my dearest love.
You're beautiful like the day.
I love you madly.
Give me your lips.
Leave me alone.
- You are not Gilles.
- What?
No, you aren't Gilles.
You look like Gilles.
You've taken his voice.
But Gilles wouldn't speak as you do.
Let's say you're right.
Who am I then?
That's not very hard.
You're the one who came yesterday.
The Devil, as you say...
The Demon, Satan.
Since you don't miss anything...
It's true.
You are Satan.
You're even too satanic.
But fortunately, some things must be beyond your control.
Beyond my control!?
But, my poor girl, nothing is beyond my control.
No one is beyond my control.
You, no more than others.
You don't know my power.
I can hold the world in these two hands.
Indeed.
Storms, rains, hail, winds, shipwrecks.
It is I.
Sickness, war and its pleasures plague, famine, poverty, murder hate, jealousy
It is I, always I.
And death...
It is again I.
Well, I understand why such a life would make you less than cheerful.
Not cheerful, I?
I who am so easily entertained.
The world's misery, for example.
I find it very amusing.
It warms my heart.
It makes me laugh.
Yes, laugh.
But I hate to laugh alone.
Do you hear me?
Why do you not answer?
What are you thinking of, you wretch?
I'm thinking of a song my nursemaid used to sing to me.
She even said that fairies...
I hate fairies.
I hate those kinds of stories.
When two lovers' hearts
Shall beat together
Enough!
If I hear you sing this song again,
I'll turn you into a stone statue.
Even if you turned me into an old woman or a dead serpent what difference would it make?
My love would remain alive.
Her love?
She dares to speak of her love!
Perfidious creature, you forget that you have committed the sin the cardinal sin.
If it's a sin to give yourself to the one you love...
- I don't regret committing it.
- Really?
- You should be ashamed.
- Ashamed?
Why?
I don't even know what shame is.
Shame...
It's what one hides.
If you're not ashamed of your love, why not shout it to the rooftops?
Alert the town?
Why?
Why not?
Hear me!
I'm shuttered here because they want to stop me from loving the one I love.
I meant no harm to anyone.
But that's how it is. I love Gilles.
Not only do I love him...
I have but one wish.
It's to be with him and to share his fate, for better and for worse.
For worse...
You can count on me for that, my child.
The sin of scandal is the greatest sin.
There is no doubt your child is possessed by the demon.
My poor Anne. My heart is aching that I treated her so.
But alas, the punishment must be as public as the shame.
Sad and lost children
We wander in the night.
Where are the day's flowers
Love's pleasures
Life's brightness?
Sad and lost children
We wander in the night.
The Devil slyly
Takes us along.
The Devil takes us away
From our beautiful loves.
Our youth is dead.
And so is our love.
How beautiful.
How beautiful to hear singing of such great sadness.
It... it's very moving.
I really liked that.
Sing again for me.
You don't want to?
You don't want me to be sad?
You don't want me to cry?
You don't want me to become as gentle as a suckling lamb?
You're wrong.
You're really set against making me happy.
So be it.
But I warn you that I'll return.
Sir Renaud has ordered me to alter your body and your face in such a way that no woman will ever want you.
Stop thinking about those things.
Close your eyes as I close mine.
Forget your chains.
Take me to that fountain.
It's so like you to forget your chains to seek refuge in sweet memories.
But alas, I'm here.
I bear no ill will.
Memories are lovely things, but trust me, what's past is past.
What matters is what's happening now.
And surprising things are happening.
See how this water is...
Clear like a cloudless sky.
What silence!
The silence of death.
Nice tournament, pretty women, lovely weather, noble lords...
And your humble servant in person, to the right of Dominique...
What a spectacle!
And see how happy everyone is!
- They're fighting to the death, I'm sure.
- True.
One of them must die.
But don't be so worried.
Just to please you,
I'll leave you the choice.
Come on, quickly, give me a name, a first name...
Don't answer him, it's useless.
He's already made a choice.
You see?
It only takes a little blood to trouble the clearest water.
You should get some rest.
You're exhausted.
Renaud...
Renaud, whom I already considered a son...
When I think this is the hand that struck him...
What can you do against a stroke of bad luck?
This hand, mine, which killed him.
Bells, always bells.
What an odd custom!
So a man died. But is that a reason to make so much noise?
Those bells are exasperating.
And Baron Hugues?
Poor Baron Hugues...
Isn't he also exasperating, with his empty phrases, his pain...? his remorse, his heavy sighs...?
Say, Dominique, you should take him away.
- Where?
- Well, I don't know where...
To the devil, as they say. So that I, or anyone, don't have to see him anymore.
It would be pleasant to spend some time here.
And Anne?
What do you think of her?
She's a very seductive creature, isn't she?
I've never seen anyone like her.
Do you really think she loves Gilles?
If she loves Gilles, she might be capable of loving another.
Who?
Would you be jealous of me, my child?
You've known me since I was small.
You know I'm not able to suffer... not able to feel pain... nor joy... nor pleasure.
Is it really necessary for me to take this old man with me?
Yes, it's his time.
He's had his day.
He's eaten his bread.
Too bad.
If I had the choice...
I'd have rather left with the other.
At least, he was young.
You'd be wrong to pay too much attention to these trifles.
They're as old as the world, and just as worn out.
Yes, it would be most pleasant...
Anne.
Be free of your chains.
Be here, in this garden... on this bench.
What does this mean?
Truly this is the first time.
Finally.
You've made me wait, my dear child.
You know well I'm not here of my own free will.
Alas. I'm sorry.
But please have a seat.
Please, don't cry.
It's hard for me to see such a young face darkened by grief.
Leave me be.
My heart is sad... so sad.
I wasn't used to misfortune.
Now there is Gilles in jail, with the executioner waiting...
Renaud who has stopped living, and my father given to despair...
Can it be you're the cause of all those evils?
What do you want?
No one loves me.
I'm forced to pass the time one way or another.
And yet, if you only knew how sensitive I am deep down.
The slightest thing touches me.
When a new happiness is born, when a new love shines... you can't imagine how much I suffer.
I would cry... if I had any tears.
But, I assure you... if someone loved me, it would make things easier.
Life would be simple and beautiful... if you would understand me a little.
Really, poor Gilles can only offer you a meaningless love.
Whereas I...
You know that's not possible... since it is Gilles I love.
What can Gilles do for you?
- Maybe you think he hears you?
- Yes, he hears me... since I love him.
Have no fear.
I love you.
Don't listen to him!
He can't do anything to you!
My love... my life...
Alas.
I fear my poor brother may have lost his mind.
It's possible.
It seems sometimes that my own mind is slipping away from me.
My guilty love for you pushed me to kill Renaud.
Why these clothes?
I'm leaving, Sir Hugues.
I too feel guilty.
Yet whatever I might have done wrong was unintentional.
How can you be blamed for being beautiful and desirable?
You don't know the whole truth.
It was only to please me that Renaud consented to fight without chain mail.
And that's how you were able to strike the fatal blow.
That's horrible.
Why did you do it?
You ask me why.
I believed Renaud was faster and stronger than you.
I feared the worst.
I was afraid to lose you.
Yes, dear sir.
I did it out of love for you.
You say you love me, yet you want to leave here... leave me.
I must go.
My life belongs to you now.
You know I won't let you leave alone.
Where you go, I will go.
Alas, dear sir...
How could I ask you to abandon everything for me?
Don't forget your promise, dear sir:
"Where you go, I will go."
You will be mine because you love Gilles and it's the only way to save him.
I can if I want... turn him into the world's most miserable, most unhappy creature.
No, you couldn't do such a thing.
Yes, I can!
I could turn him into something even more horrible and terrifying.
- I have a wealth of choices.
- I beg you!
But I can also let him go, having forgotten you.
Free of cares, memories or regrets.
Alive!
Just like any other man.
He can't forget me.
But everyone forgets. He will right away.
You, a little later.
I don't want to.
If he forgot me, I'd remain forever alone.
Would you rather be with a monster who remembers you?
Also, deep down,
I'm really not a bad sort.
I can make you happy.
Trust me.
Your slightest wish will be my command.
I wish but one thing.
To return to Gilles in the hole from which he's calling me.
- Be quiet!
- I do want to rejoin Gilles.
Can't you hear him calling me?
She's mocking me.
Yet I love her.
I've been too gentle, too attentive.
That is not the way to please women.
But that's all about to change.
Why so sad, Anne?
Look at me... and think of me... as if it were the last time.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
I don't know.
I love you so!
That's why...
I fear that one day... you'll forget me.
Forget you?
But Anne, you know I'd sooner forget to live... to breathe.
Am I disturbing you perhaps?
Excuse me.
I've come to get an answer.
I don't know what he's asked you.
But don't answer him.
Don't fall into his traps.
I believe, dear child, that nothing keeps you here now that your father has left.
- My father?
- Yes, don't worry about him.
He left with Dominique.
All's well that ends well.
Of course, there's a slight age difference.
But what does it matter since they love each other?
Anyway, enough about them.
Let's talk about us... and about him... since he still interests you.
Be quiet!
Leave her be!
I know my fate is in your hands.
But why does it concern you?
Since I love her and you can't harm her.
What do you know?
Come, Anne. Let's talk seriously.
Gilles wrote this, signed this... with his own hand, in his own blood.
He was wrong to, but he did it.
We can't change that.
Please answer me.
Really? If I say yes... he'll be free forever...
Like fish in water... like birds in the trees.
Don't listen to him!
Please, Anne, do you agree to follow me?
Will you try to love me?
Yes.
Finally!
What a beautiful sun.
And what a lovely castle.
Why am I locked up?
You are not locked up.
You are free, completely free on the contrary.
Good, that's much better.
Can you tell me where we are?
Who owns this castle?
You perhaps?
Oh, I don't care.
I don't want to know you.
I don't like the way you smile.
In any case, none of this matters.
I feel like laughing.
I'm alive.
The sun is shining.
Why ask for more?
How beautiful you are!
Creatures like this are only found in dreams.
You are the loveliest girl in the world.
But why are you so sad?
Come away, you don't belong here.
- Your daughter?
- No, she is not.
Oh, I see.
I also understand her sadness.
Truly the world is awry.
Youth should live with youth.
Perhaps she loves you after all.
In any case, it's not my concern.
Forgive me.
I've kept my promise.
You are mine now and forever.
No.
What?
No.
That can't be!
You promised!
You swore!
I lied.
That's not possible.
You don't know how...
You can't lie!
Yet I lied.
It's the truth.
Not possible. Absolutely impossible.
Anne, pure like the day... clear like spring water...
Anne, the only person in the world
I trusted.
Why have you done such a thing?
How dare you?
All's fair in love.
To save Gilles,
I'd have done much worse.
He's lost to me and I'm alone forever.
And yet... just now... without recognizing me... he found me beautiful and he told me so.
Be quiet!
If you insist on talking like this, you don't know what I can do with you.
Do with me as you will.
But please, let me return one last time to that fountain, where I was happy.
So be it!
You?
Surely, good fortune led me here.
- You're alone?
- Yes.
And that old man who was with you isn't here?
No.
I'm all the happier.
Are you thirsty?
This water is so sweet.
Your lips too are sweet.
My love.
I knew I couldn't lose you.
Move away from him!
No.
Nothing can ever keeps us apart.
For the last time, move away from him!
To stone...
You hear me?
To stone you will be turned.
Finally, the silence I love.
The silence of death.
What's this?
What's that noise?
It's their heart I'm hearing.
Their heart that beats... that keeps beating and beating... and beating and beating... and beating...
This is the universe.
Big, isn't it?
Thousands of suns, millions of stars,...
...separated by immense distances and by thin floating clouds of gas.
The starlight makes the gas transparent.
Where there are no stars it appears as dark, obscuring clouds...
...like that great black cone over there.
Hello,...
...there's a nova.
A whole solar system exploded.
Someone must've been messing about with the uranium atom.
No, it's not our solar system,
I'm glad to say.
Ah, those are called a globular cluster of stars.
Rather fine.
Down here in the right-hand corner,...
...see that little chap rather like a boy scout's badge?
It's a mass of gas expanding at thousands of cubic miles a minute.
Ah, here we are, we're getting nearer home.
The moon, our moon,...
...in the first quarter,...
...and here's the Earth, our Earth,...
...moving around in its place,...
...part of the pattern, part of the universe.
Reassuring, isn't it?
- (thunder)
- It's night over Europe.
The night of the 2nd May, 1945.
That point of fire is a burning city.
It had a thousand-bomber raid an hour ago.
(explosions)
And here, rolling in over the Atlantic,...
- (foghorn)
- ...is a real English fog.
I hope all our aircraft got home safely.
- Even the big ships sound frightened.
- (Morse code signals)
Listen to all the noises in the air.
(Churchill on radio)
"This was their finest hour".
- (German voices on radio)
- Listen...
- Listen...
- (German radio messages)
(woman) "Request your position".
"Come in, Lancaster.
Come in, Lancaster".
(man) "Position nil. Repeat, nil.
Age 27. Very important".
"Education violently interrupted.
Religion - Church of England".
"Politics - Conservative by nature,
Labour by experience".
- "What's your name?"
- I cannot read you.
Cannot read you.
Request your position.
Can you see our signals?
"Give me my scallop-shell of quiet,
My staff of faith to walk upon,...
...My scrip of joy, immortal diet,
My bottle of salvation,...
...My gown of glory, hope's true gage,
And thus I'll take my pilgrimage".
"Sir Walter Raleigh wrote that".
"I'd rather have written that than flown through Hitler's legs".
- (aircraft engine drones)
- I cannot understand you.
Hello, Lancaster. We are sending signals.
Can you see our signals?
Come in, Lancaster. Come in, Lancaster.
But at my back I always hear
Time's wingèd chariot hurrying near.
And yonder all before us lie
Deserts of vast eternity.
Andy Marvell. What a marvel!
What's your name?
Are you receiving me?
Repeat, are you receiving me?
Request your position.
Come in, Lancaster.
I can't give you my position.
Instruments gone, crew gone.
Except Bob, my sparks. He's dead.
The rest bailed out on my orders.
Time 03.35. Get that?
Crew bailed out 03.35
"Station - Warrenden.
Bomber Group - A, G."
Station - Warrenden.
Bomber Group - A, Apple, G, George.
They'll be sorry about Bob.
We liked him.
Hello, G, George. Hello, G, George.
Are you all right?
Are you going to try to land?
Do you want a fix?
Name's not G, George, it's P, Peter.
Peter D Carter. D's for David.
Squadron Leader Peter Carter.
Can't land - undercarriage is gone.
I'm bailing out, I'm bailing out.
- "Take a telegram".
- Received your message.
- We can hear you.
- "Telegram to my mother".
"Mrs Michael Carter,
88 Hampstead Lane, London Northwest".
88 Hampstead Lane, London.
Tell her that I love her.
You'll have to write this, but I want her to know I love her very much.
I've never shown it to her, not really,...
...but I've loved her always right up to the end.
"Give my love to my two sisters, too.
Don't forget them".
Received your message.
We can hear you.
Are you wounded? Repeat, are you wounded? Are you bailing out?
- What's your name?
- June.
Yes, I'm bailing out, but there's a catch.
I've got no parachute.
H- Hello? Hello, Peter, do not understand.
Hello? Hello, Peter, can you hear me?
"Hello, June, don't be afraid.
It's quite simple".
We've had it and I'd rather jump than fry.
After the first thousand feet
I shan't know anything, anyway.
"I say, I hope I haven't frightened you".
- No, I'm not frightened.
- "Good girl!"
Your sparks, you said he was dead.
Hasn't he got a chute?
Cut to ribbons. Cannon shell.
Are you pretty?
Not bad.
- "Can you hear me well?"
- Yes.
You've got guts. I've known dozens of girls, been in love with some.
But an American girl I've never seen and never shall see...
...will hear my last words.
"Rather sweet".
June, if you're around when they pick me up,...
...turn your head away.
But perhaps we can do something, Peter.
Let me report it.
"No, no-one can help. Only you.
Let me do this in my own way".
"I want to be alone with you.
Where were you born?"
- Boston.
- "Mass?"
Yes.
History was made there. Are you in love with anybody? No, don't answer.
I could love a man like you, Peter.
I love you, June, you're life.
Do you live on the station?
No, in a big house five miles from here.
Lee Wood House.
- "Old house?"
- Yes, very old.
I'll come and see you as a ghost!
You're not frightened of ghosts?
I'm not frightened.
- "What time will you be home?"
- I'm on duty till 6.
I have breakfast in the mess, then I have to cycle half an hour.
I often go along the sands.
This is such nonsense!
It's the best sense I ever heard.
I was lucky to get you.
Can't be helped about the parachute.
I'll have wings soon.
Hope they haven't gone modern.
I'd hate to have a prop instead!
- "What's the next world like?"
- Oh, Peter!
"I think it starts where this one leaves off".
Or where it could if we listened to Plato, Aristotle and Jesus.
With all our earthly problems solved but with greater ones worth solving.
I'm signing off now, June.
Goodbye. Goodbye, June.
Hello, G for George. Hello, G, George!
Hello, G, George!
- Hel...
- (clock ticks in the background)
(sobs)
So long, Bob, I'll see you in a minute.
You know what we wear by now - prop or wings.
(Ghostly voice) A prop... or wings.
Prop...
...or wings.
Prop...
...or wings.
A prop... or wings.
Prop... or wings.
Prop...
...or wings.

(excitable French)
Vrrrrrrm!
(continues in French)
- Aghh!
- Oh, bad luck, old boy.
(# mouth organ... mournful tune)
(# mournful tune plays on)
Name and rank.
(American accent) Come on, fellas, break it up, spread out.
Room with bath.
- Do you have USO shows here?
- No, we don't.
OK, we'll stay.
Officers' quarters, of course.
- We're all the same here, Captain.
- Excuse me,... brother.
Take over.
- I wish I could make a phone call.
- From here that'd be long distance.
Flying Officer Trubshaw.
You can't wait here. You must be mistaken about your captain.
- If anyone's mistaken, it's not me.
- Mistakes don't happen here.
- This is the Aircrew Section?
- You should know.
Peter couldn't have got away with it.
Besides, you checked his invoice for me.
Yes, it was against the regulations.
Regulations are made to be broken.
He was due half an hour after me.
This is his section. He hasn't reported.
He's either AWOL or there's been a mistake.
There hasn't been a mistake here for 1,000 years.
Oh? So there have been mistakes?
The girl here before me was here 640 years.
Holy smoke!
If the records don't balance, alarm bells ring in the Records Office.
I bet they do. Proper flap, eh?
Yes.
That's only the living records.
Everyone on Earth has a file.
Russian, Chinese, black or white,
Republican or Democrat.
Holy smoke! If anyone had said clerks worked up here just like on Earth...
Everyone here can start how they like.
Heaven, isn't it?
You see?
There are millions of people on Earth who'd think it heaven to be a clerk.
And don't say "Holy smoke".
- Why not?
- There's no smoke without fire...
...and we don't call smoke... holy.
Thanks for the gen,... Section Officer.
Boy, oh, boy, home was nothin' like this!
Mine was.
Sign here.
All right, I don't want to start those bells ringing!
(bells ring)
I wonder where I report.
(dog howls)
Oh, I always hoped there would be dogs.
(# plaintive flute music )
(# gentle, wistful tune)
(dog barks)
Good morning.
Morning.
Where do I go from here?
- Huh?!
- I'm new, I only just arrived.
- Where do I report?
- You mean the aerodrome?
Aerodrome?
Where am I? This place, what's it called?
- The Burrows.
- Where?
- Lee Wood.
- Lee Wood?
- Yeah.
- Do you know Lee Wood House?
That's it - where the smoke is, behind those trees.
- Is that the quickest way?
- There's a track. See that bike?
- Who is it?
- Dunno. One of the Yank girls.
They live up at the house.
Here, Jock! (whistles)
Hi!
Hello.
Hello yourself. What's wrong?
You're June.
You're Peter!
How did you get here?
I'm glad you're safe.
What did you do? What happened?
- I just don't know.
- Are you hurt?
My head feels a bit queer.
There's a little cut in your hair.
It's nothing much.
Oh, Peter, it was a cruel joke.
If it was, it was on me.
I've been crying ever since we said goodbye.
- Don't cry, darling.
- Oh, Peter, darling.
(Recorder) 91,716 invoiced.
91,715 checked in.
- Conductor 71.
- It could've 'appened to anybody.
How did it happen?
Everything was calculated but for the accursed fog!
The pilot jumped, he got lost in the fog, I missed him.
Flying Officer Trubshaw.
You've been waiting all day for your pilot.
Yes, ma'am. Over the Channel, there was a ruddy peasouper!
Ah-ha!
Oh, excuse the language, ma'am.
It was so thick, you could've stepped out of the kite and walked on it!
- Sacré brouillard!
- And he, the skipper,...
...ordered everybody to bail out over the coast.
He knew his brolly... chute... had been written off.
It was hit as he was bandaging me.
But he didn't tell the others.
I only knew because I'd bought it by then.
I mean, I was... dead.
I understand.
I knew he'd be clocking in here.
I thought I'd stooge around and wait for him. Er, this young lady...
...is not to blame at all.
- I'm sorry if I broke the rules.
- Thank you.
19 hours and 50 minutes have elapsed.
Don't you know that any slip must be reported immediately?
- I lost my head.
- Not long in the service.
I joined in the so-called
Second Germinal...
...of the so-called glorious French Revolution.
I see. Natural death.
I lost my head.
The case is not so simple.
- Non?
- No.
He's fallen in love.
Ahhhh!
Oh.
- It complicates things.
- True.
- You must do your best.
- Oui, madame.
- Proceed to Earth immediately.
- Oui.
You'll explain your grave error to Carter...
- ...and ask him to follow you.
- Oui, madame.
Wait!
Your captain is not an unreasonable man, I hope.
The skipper? Oh, no, ma'am... unless he's had a few!
Er... pardon? 'Ad a few?
- Beers.
- Oh, la bière!
Scotch being hard to come by, you know.
- Naturellement!
- By the way,...
...would you give Peter a message for me?
Avec plaisir.
Just say, "What ho".
Bon.
One is starved for Technicolor up there.
What a night for love!
Drink, darling?
Mon ami.
Evening.
I think I keep this for a little.
And how are you, my friend?
Never been better.
- June, wake...
- She cannot wake.
We are talking in space, not in time.
- Are you cracked?
- Look at your watch.
It has not moved since you said so charmingly "Drink, darling?"
Nor will it move,...
...nor will anything move...
...until we have finished our little talk.
It is only a trick.
Who are you?
We should've met yesterday at 04.10, mon cher.
Unfortunately I missed you.
You couldn't have because I wasn't here.
I bring you a message from Mr Trubshaw.
Bob?
- Bob's dead.
- Oh, yes, he's dead.
He says... "What ho!"
That sounds like Trubshaw.
But he is dead, isn't he?
- En effet. But how? Why?
- Cannon shell.
And what should happen to a man...
...who jumps from his aircraft without his parachute?
How do you know?
But it is I who am telling you, my friend.
It is I!
Your time was up,...
...but I missed you because of your ridiculous English climate.
I am French.
- But what do you want now?
- You, my friend.
- What for?
- To conduct you.
- Where to?
- To the training centre.
- Training for what?
- For another world.
You don't mean...?
But, my dear friend, that is just what I do mean.
Oh, this is absolutely fantastic!
- June!
- (conductor laughs)
June!
All right, and what if I refuse to go?
But you cannot refuse. Your time was up.
Now, by mistake, you overstayed by about,...
...speaking in time, of course,...
...20 hours.
The advantage was exclusively yours.
You lost nothing, you only gained.
What about her?
(conductor chuckles)
Exquise.
You will see her again when her time comes.
She will live to be... ninety-seven.
I looked her up in the files.
- I'm in love with her.
- But, my friend, what is love?
The feeling of the moment,...
...but I represent eternity.
The law of this world and the other.
- Good, but what is law?
- Law is law.
- Law is based on reason.
- That is so.
Now, yesterday I wasn't in love.
Today I am.
But what is love?
How many people are in love?
Soldiers, airmen, how many sailors?
Do they protest when their time is up?
No, they don't.
- They have no right, but I have.
- Why?
Look, I've fallen in love because of your mistake.
I'm in a different position from what I was in last night.
I expected to die, I was ready to die.
It wasn't my fault I didn't, it was yours!
- What government do you represent?
- None!
What laws govern the place?
I cannot express any political views.
A respectable place must have law of appeal.
- Be reasonable! Appeal to whom?
- You find out.
- It has never been done!
- Is that any reason why it can't be done?
You are determined to get me into... the salad.
What about the salad you got me into?
Now, look here, you don't want me to use force, do you?
Oh, well, you can always try.
- I think I leave you for a little.
- That's the form.
- I shall report for instructions.
- Now you're talking!
And... do not fall any deeper in love now.
You have been warned.
She is...
...charming.
You know, I think you're not a bad chap.
Do you play chess?
Yes.
So do I.
We could play every day.
Some other time.
Next time, perhaps?
Au revoir, mon ami.
No, thank you, darling.
"No, thank you" what?
You just asked me to have a drink.
Did I?
Yes, I remember I did.
- What's the matter with me?
- What is it? Is it your head again?
Might be, yes.
An odd thing happened while you were asleep.
I haven't been asleep.
Didn't you hear us talking?
No.
Who was there to talk to?
- They sent somebody.
- They? Who are they?
I don't know.
June, do I look cracked?
Not to me, darling. Are you?
There was a ten-tenths' fog last night.
- That's right, isn't it?
- You know there was.
- I did bail out without a parachute.
- That's your story.
- So how can I be alive?
- I give up.
- I don't know and I don't care.
- My parachute was shot up.
When I came to, I had none.
Anyway, why wasn't I drowned?
No need to prove to me you ought to be dead.
I ought to be according to this character.
This conductor they sent after me said he missed me in the fog.
Bad luck for them, good luck for me.
I said I'd appeal.
He's gone to get instructions.
It's not my fault I'm not dead!
It's not my fault I found you and fell in love with you.
Maybe he wasn't here at all!
Hey, you, Frenchman!
Where are you?!
- What is it?
- Ohh, I've got an awful headache.
June?
June, you're there, aren't you?
Yes, Peter, of course I'm here.
I... thought I'd lost you.
(phone rings)
Dr Reeves's residence.
Oh, good morning, Miss June.
Yes, isn't it? The doctor's up in his thing - his camera obscura.
He's got his new lens from the shop today. It makes a lovely picture.
He's taken the big white garden table to project on.
He'll be glad you're coming over.
He's showing it to the dogs.
(Dr Reeves) Ah, nice day.
Hmm, Mrs Bedwell's ducks out too early.
She'll lose all the eggs if she's not careful.
Ahh, the start of the cycling season.
There's a hefty young girl.
Time Mrs Tucker went to get our rations.
There she is.
Ooh, the Vicar and his sister - not coming here, I hope. No. Good.
Quite a queue at the butcher's.
Must have some offal.
Wonderful how the kids love playing in the splash. The same in my day.
That tree ought to come down.
Old Mary looking quite skittish.
Sally Allgood getting herself dated up.
Ah, here's June, here she comes.
She walks in beauty like the night.
Only she's cycling and the sun is out.
Nice girl.
Worth a hatful of ambassadors in Lee Wood, anyway.
Come on up!
Hello, Doc.
Hello, June. Come in, shut the door.
Surveying your kingdom?
A village doctor has to know everything.
You'd be surprised how many diagnoses
I've formed up here.
I love looking at the village from here.
Looks so different.
That's because you see it all clearly and at once, as in a poet's eye.
I want to talk to you.
So you said, but it's none of my business.
Dr McEwen says it's right up your street.
This is my street, a village street.
I'm a village doctor.
Only because you like living here.
McEwen says what you don't know about neurology would fill a peanut.
I'm a good guesser.
Your guesses are in famous magazines...
...like that "Brain" I've seen in your library.
- Dr McEwen says...
- I know what he says.
- I had a talk with him on the phone.
- Oh, did you?
After I'd talked to you.
This is the RAF's business.
Carter should rejoin his station today.
- I know.
- What's it got to do with you?
Oh, I'm just interested.
Oh, I see.
Strictly speaking, he's a RAF case.
He's not a case, he's a person, a very fine person.
I want you to see him, Frank.
I don't want just anyone mauling him and asking him questions.
I want you. I'm sure the RAF would say...
I know what they'd say.
I spoke to his CO this morning.
- Oh, Frank!
- And to his Group MO.
- Fortunately, he's heard of me.
- Frank!
If you'd done that earlier,
I'd have told you earlier.
You can't kidnap RAF officers just cos you like the shape of their nose!
Not his nose, his voice.
I fell for that before I saw him.
He believes he jumped with no parachute?
- Yes.
- He has hallucinations?
During these bouts, does he go pale?
- Yes, yes, he did.
- He has headaches... here?
I think so. You'd better ask him.
- But he definitely sees things?
- And hears.
All right. Did you tell him he was talking rubbish?
- No.
- Quite right.
He's not. He's talking very logically.
Then he can't be in love. Bye.
- Frank...
- Yes?
He has a very cute nose, too!
- I'll be over about teatime.
- Right.
It's Dr Reeves. Let's go!
Yippeeeee!
- That's not how to spell Shakespeare.
- Who are you, his agent?
(Girl) You spotted snakes with double tongue,
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
Newts and blind-worms... er...
(Prompter) Do no wrong.
...do no wrong,
Come not near our fairy queen.
You can never bring in a wall.
What say you, Bottom?
- Some guy or other...
- No, no, no!
My dear Private Logan,
Bottom's not a gangster. Watch!
Some man or other must present wall: and let him have some plaster or some loam or some rough-cast about him...
...to signify wall;...
...and let him hold his fingers thus...
...and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.
- Try that, my boy.
- Can I do the business?
- It's as well, yes.
- Oh, brother!
Some man or other must present wall: and let him have some plaster or some loam or some rough-cast about him...
...to signify wall.
(classical music )
(sinister music )
Check.
Peter?
Check.
Oh, dear, I didn't see that one coming.
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, Frank.
Squadron Leader Carter - Dr Reeves.
- Do I get some tea?
- It's ordered. Ginger cookies.
- Good. Who's winning?
- June's good.
But he's winning. Sit down, everybody.
Thank you.
- I've told Peter.
- What?
Who you are, what you are, all about you.
- Tall order.
- And I've told you all about him.
- Has she read your poems?
- What poems?
Didn't you know? This is Peter Carter.
- I didn't know.
- We hadn't got around to that.
I haven't got much modern stuff, but you're there.
- Good.
- I like your viewpoint, your English.
- I hope we shall have some talks.
- So do I.
Let's get down to this thing.
You've never had any visions or hallucinations before?
- Never.
- What were you before?
I did European History at Oxford.
- Both parents alive?
- My mother.
- Brothers, sisters?
- Two sisters.
What was the cause of your father's death?
Same as mine.
- Brain?
- No, war.
- When?
- You're... er... 29?
- Called up?
- Volunteered.
- Trained in Canada. Ops in '41.
- Bomber?
Coastals, then instructor, back to bombers.
- Must've done a good many ops?
They let you go back with your experience and seniority?
- New job. Master bomber.
- Tricky?
- Somebody's got to do it.
- Hmm.
Now... about these headaches.
- When did they start?
- Headaches?
I know you get them and you've told nobody about them, especially your MO.
- What else do you know?
- I know about your eyes.
- You know a good deal.
- Like to know more.
All right.
Now, these headaches, when did they start?
- Six months ago.
- Bad?
- Not at first.
- Where?
- Here.
- Frontal and temporal.
Did you ever have a rather nasty bang on the head?
- I don't think so.
- Sure?
The usual one - dropped as a baby.
Has that spoilt everything for you?
- Yes, I'm afraid it does.
- I'll see what I can cook up.
- Do you mind if I try something?
- No, go ahead.
Now... er... just face this way. Don't move.
Now, don't move your eyes, look straight ahead.
- Check.
- What are you looking at?
- The girl with red hair and legs!
- Right, I've got her.
- Don't take your eyes off her.
- Easy!
Without moving your eyes, what can you see on the extreme right?
- Fireplace.
- In the centre?
- Girl.
- Extreme left?
Windows?
- Curtains?
- Yes.
- Colour?
- Red.
Right, that'll do.
If you've quite done staring at that girl's legs...
You've got to do as the doctor says.
Confidentially, they're rather knock-kneed.
Hmm.
- Any loss of appetite?
- No.
- Nor of thirst?
- No fear.
You've been eating and drinking more than usual.
- You've just seen my mess bills!
- And you've... seen something.
- Someone.
- Clearly?
As clear as I see you.
- Had such an hallucination before?
- No, thanks.
Do you believe in the survival of human personality after death?
I thought you said you read my verses.
Do you?
I don't know, I've never thought about it.
Do you?
I don't know.
I've thought about it too much.
- I thought I was asked to tea.
- It isn't time yet.
Past my time. One last question.
It may sound silly, but have you imagined recently...
...that you've smelt something that couldn't be there?
What an extraordinary thing!
- What is?
- How did you know?
A long shot. You have?
Yes. It was so silly,
I'd never have told you.
It might explain everything abnormal you've seen and heard.
But it still can't explain how I can jump without a parachute and be alive.
No, but there might be a possible explanation even of that.
Now, this heavenly messenger, you saw him quite clearly?
I told you, as clear as I see you.
This smell you imagined was at the same time?
Yes, it was particularly strong.
- A pleasant smell?
- Yes.
- Could you place it?
- Fried onions.
And this messenger, he hasn't turned up again?
- No, but he will.
- When?
- He picks his own time and stops it.
- Peter's appealed against his call-up.
- That's the spirit. Don't give in.
- I won't.
I'm lucky June knew you.
Thank you for coming.
June has lucky friends. I've got bad news.
- Why the grin?
- You're going with me.
- Where?
- My house. For two reasons.
I want to meet this chap next time...
...and I like a nice girl in the house.
She only comes to borrow a book and she's a slow reader!
- What about my CO?
- I've fixed it with him.
Besides, until we get this settled,
I'm your CO.
At my house, you get your tea at 4.30.
(man) Tea break!
Here you get it at five.
Sinkers, Doc?
Thank you.
We're shaping, Frank, we're shaping!
(ping-pong game in progress)
(rhythmic batting of the ball)
(Dr Reeves) Ohhh!
(batting stops)
(batting resumes)
Ah-ha! 20-all!
21-20. Sorry.
- You're sorry, my foot! Ready?
- Ready.
- Nearly.
- Nearly doesn't count. 21-all.
- I'll be...
- Count 10.
I wonder if Peter's a good player.
- Ask him when he wakes.
- He's been asleep 21/2 hours.
- He'll wake at 11.
- How do you know?
- I gave him a tablet.
- How can you tell?
- I know the patient.
- Do you know him?
- I think so.
- Tell me about him!
Are we playing table tennis or are we not?
- All right, your serve.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- Ohh!
Your game.
Now tell me what you think about him.
- I think he's fascinating.
- So do I.
Not biologically. Medically.
- Have a drink?
- Love one.
What do the books say, Doc?
I see a dark stranger in his life.
Do you know what's wrong with him?
Yes, I think I do.
Is he... going to be all right?
He'll be all right. Here's your drink.
Will he have any more hallucinations?
- Yes.
- How do you know?
Because this conductor promised to come back.
- Will that make him worse?
- Why should it?
I don't know. Seeing things, arguing about his own life.
- Talking to a non-existent man...
- He does exist for him.
He's not going mad?
His brain isn't being affected?
It is, but not in the way you mean.
That's why I asked him about his sense of smell.
I saw it was important.
He's having highly organised hallucinations...
...comparable to an experience of actual life.
A combination of vision, hearing and idea.
To a neurologist, it points directly to the sense of smell or taste.
Once that connection's established, we know where to look.
I want to find out one thing more in his history. I'll find it out later.
Now...
- I'm not going to tell you any more.
- Thanks.
- But how did he survive the jump?
- I don't know.
If we could find out and tell him, it would save him.
It would help, but the main thing is for him to win his case.
- Are you serious?
- Perfectly serious.
- We must help him to win it.
- How?
It depends on what message the conductor brings.
But... suppose he loses his case?
Oh, that's absurd!
If we see he's losing or we think he's going to lose,...
...we'll find out the reason he survived or we'll invent one.
We'll have a couple of drinks...
...and we'll invent the greatest lie in medical history.
- Care for another game?
- I don't mind.
- Don't worry. See that bell?
- Yes.
He'll ring it if he gets another visit.
- Fine.
- Come on, your serve.
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.
One-love.
(no sound)
(no sound)
Doc, he's here! June!
Doc?
Eh bien, mon cher, comment ça va?
Not too good.
Not too good. Ah.
I would not bother to ring that bell if I were you. Nothing will happen.
A little trick of mine. You remember?
After all,...
...what is time?
(wind whistles violently)
(thunder)
A mere... tyranny.
Let me know if you're going to do that again.
- Looks good.
- Very good. Know the author?
No, but I often have a game with Philidor.
- Philidor?
- The greatest chess master ever.
A Frenchman.
Come along and I'll introduce you.
- Good.
- Splendid!
- You've got good news for me.
- How did you guess?
You wouldn't entice me with Philimor...
- Philidor.
- ...if you had the right to conduct me.
- True.
- Well?
Speaking officially,
I have good news for you.
Good!
- You can appeal to the High Court.
- Splendid!
The trial will be très chic. In three days so you can prepare your case.
Better and better.
- Do not be too pleased.
- Is there a catch?
The prosecuting counsel.
I am not permitted to offer advice or give a personal opinion but...
- Who is this counsel?
- Be prepared.
- For what?
- A shock.
- Tell me the worst. Who is it?
- Abraham Farlan.
- Come again?
- Abraham Farlan!
- Never heard of him.
- No?
- Never.
- He lives in Boston.
- I've never been.
- Massachusetts.
- I've never been there!
- Abraham Farlan died in Boston in 1775.
Does that date convey anything to you?
Lexington, Concord.
You are good at history.
The American War of Independence.
- Oh, he was killed?
- By a British bullet.
Oh. He might be... prejudiced.
Hmm. He hates your guts.
And he hates the guts of every Englishman.
And he hates this little affair with the Boston-born girl.
It's not a little affair.
Ohh, a big affair he will hate even more!
- I'll appeal against him.
- No good!
We had to choose a good man.
Our honour is at stake.
Non, you must choose a good man for yourself.
- As defending counsel?
- Precisely.
- Can I choose anybody?
- Anybody who's ever lived on earth.
Everybody is at your disposal.
- You can choose me.
- That would suit your book.
Do not waste time. Abraham Farlan is piling up his case already.
You can choose Socrates, William Pitt,...
...you can choose Henry Vlll.
Oh, Madame Du Barry.
- She knows all about love.
- Rather a one-track mind.
You are a good chess player. Philidor.
I'll think it over.
By the way, I'd like to borrow this.
It's not mine, it belongs to the doctor.
- Oh, doctors.
- What about them?
They give me a great deal of trouble in my job.
(bell rings)
- He was here! He tricked us!
- Yes, he was... here.
And these were on the floor.
Peter, sit down.
Now...
...look up.
You've been doing some hard talking.
I have.
- You didn't give in to anything?
- No.
- That's the spirit.
- Can I stay overnight?
- Yes, I'll tell Mrs Tucker.
- I don't need much.
Now, let's see.
Hmm. I'll tell Mrs Tucker you're staying.
Dr Reeves, can I stay in here?
I want to be near these books.
Of course. I'll fix up a camp bed.
Great news, darling.
- I'm allowed to appeal.
- Really?
June, I don't want to leave you.
Darling, why should you?
Everything will be all right.
- If I can get a good counsel.
- Of course you will.
It's very important.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't intend to let you go.
No-one can take you. I won't let them.
A judgement against me would be backed up...
...by all the power of this world and of the other.
Drink this.
- Peter's got the right to appeal.
- Splendid.
- Smell anything?
- Yes.
- Fried onions?
- Yes.
Good. Drink that up.
- Any headache?
- Mm.
Tell me tomorrow what he said.
No, he said...
- Good heavens!
- What is it?
- He got my Hundred Best Games.
- Alekhese's chess book!
- You sure?
- Certain. He had it in his hand.
- What a nerve!
- A bit cool.
- Now, get to bed.
- I want to talk to you first.
No, have a long sleep.
Tomorrow, you'll feel as fresh as a daisy.
- You don't believe a word I say!
- Of course we do!
My dear friend, here on Earth
I am your defending counsel.
As your counsel,
I believe everything you tell me.
- Dr Gaerlter.
- Hello, Dr Reeves.
You make your rounds the hard way.
Give me a coupe!
- Is Dr McEwen free?
- He's going to operate.
He hasn't started yet.
I imagine he'll see you in the washroom.
- Hello, Frank, what's new?
- Deterioration.
We ought to operate tonight.
Impossible, we're swamped.
Sure of your diagnosis?
Certain. He had slight concussion two years ago - no aftereffects.
The X-ray's inconclusive.
You know about these hallucinations coupled with a sense of smell.
It points to arachnoid adhesions involving the olfactory nerve.
A tricky op. I've never seen one.
I have - at the Hospital de la Pitié in Paris.
I've made some notes for the surgeon.
It'll be Dr Leiser, a fine neurosurgeon.
- Leiser, good man.
- We can't manage tonight.
There's no crisis in such a thing.
- Any day will do.
- No, it won't.
I'll tell you why and why there is a crisis.
I'm afraid his brain may be permanently affected.
Insanity?
- Yes.
- Why?
Because his trial is on for tonight.
He hasn't found anyone to defend him.
He spends all his time in my library.
He only sleeps when I drug him.
The boy has a fine mind but it's taxed.
That's the trouble, it's too good a mind.
A weak mind isn't strong enough to hurt itself.
Stupidity has saved many a man from going mad.
Yes, you're right there.
He's had several talks with this heavenly messenger.
Hallucinations, but you never saw such an imagination!
I've been taking tips on the other world - law, system, architecture.
Interestingly, he never crosses the limits of his imagination.
- I don't get you.
- Nothing he invents is fantastic.
It's invention, but logical invention.
The keystone to his invention is that the trial takes place tonight.
He must win or lose his case tonight.
We ought to operate tonight.
No use shaking your head.
We need to find a counsel to save him losing his case or we may lose him!
What about...
...him?
Lincoln?
No, it's hardly fair to drag him in.
I don't believe he'd be prejudiced.
Plato.
How would you like to be defended by Plato?
Nobody knew more about reasoning.
He was 81 when he died. He might be too old to think love important.
Do you think so? Anyhow, Plato had very elementary ideas about love.
Besides, didn't he quote Sophocles...
...when someone asked him if he could still appreciate a woman?
- What did the old boy say?
- "I'm glad to be rid of all that".
"It's like escaping from bondage to a raving madman".
Tut!
These Greeks - cold as their marble.
If he had been French... Richelieu, for example. Irresistible at 80!
How about Richelieu?
No, I never liked him much in "The Three Musketeers".
(conductor) Solomon.
Solomon?
Non?
Mais, mon Dieu, who do you want?
You have only a few hours left!
It sounds a grand idea to have all these great men to choose from,...
...but what do they know of our problems today?
True. Very little.
Besides,
I think it ought to be an Englishman.
Nobody famous, but somebody with his head screwed on.
Screwed?
- Now, this Abraham... er...?
- Farlan.
Was he a famous man?
First American killed by a British bullet.
I mean, was he a great philosopher or statesman?
- He was a schoolteacher.
- There, you see!
Now, Plato would probably talk about perceptions and causations.
Pardon?
- Over your head, too?
- Definitely.
It's quite simple...
By the way, why are you so interested in my winning my case?
I?
Yes, you!
And why am I being taken up this... stairway?
I'm not being taken for a ride, am I?
- What a suggestion!
- Take that bit of barley sugar away.
I don't like it or your suggestions!
I'll go back before it's too late.
Peter! Peter!
Peter!
Peter...!
Peter!
Peter, come back!
Peter, Peter!
Peter!
Peter, Peter!
Come back!
- Peter!
- (June) Peter, come back!
(June) Peter, come back!
Peter! Peter, come back!
Peter! Peter!
Come back!
Peter, Peter, come back!
- (thunder)
- Peter! Peter!
Peter, my darling, come back to me!
He almost got me!
(thunder)
(thunder)
(wind howls)
He'll be all right in a moment.
Why isn't the ambulance here?
It was due half an hour ago.
Phone Dr McEwen, say we must operate tonight. It's life or death.
Tell him about the ambulance.
Telegraph his mother and two sisters.
- Yes, Doctor.
- That's all.
Now, Peter...
- Where's June?
- Phoning. Back in a moment.
- He almost got me.
- I know.
Crafty beggar.
I got away by the skin of my teeth.
Don't let anybody fool you into giving up this case!
You were promised a fair trial.
Don't give in! Promise?
- Got no counsel.
- We'll find the right man.
- They can't start without counsel.
- They may appoint some stooge.
- Nonsense.
- Or let it go by default.
We'll find somebody.
They can't start till then.
Nobody famous!
No, that'd be the worst thing we could do.
- How about a pal of yours?
- Might find somebody.
- Your radio operator?
- Bob?
Yes. Think it over.
- You couldn't get through?
- No.
It's the storm.
They always cut the phone off.
- I'll go on my bike.
- No, you're more valuable here.
If the ambulance comes, don't wait for me.
And if I meet it, I'll come back.
Go to him, don't allow him to despair.
His life is in your hands.
(wind howls)
(thunder)
(wind howls)
- Where's Frank?
- He won't be long, darling.
I must talk to him.
I don't think Bob's the right man.
I'll tell him you said so.
- Do you know Bob?
- No.
He was my sparks.
- Highly operational type.
- We'll find somebody.
- Time's nearly up.
- Frank'll come up with something.
I wish he'd hurry.
(thunder)
- Look out!
- (screeching tyres)
Dr Reeves!
Get the fire extinguishers and the blankets!
- Can I help you, sir?
- Watch the road!
(thunder)
(ambulance bell ringing)
He never saw us until it was too late.
He turned off to save us.
Gosh, I feel bad about it.
He was a fine man.
You couldn't help it.
He was interested in this case, wasn't he?
Yes.
I saw his notes he left for Dr Leiser.
It was a fine piece of diagnosis.
He left notes for the operation, too.
- Dr Leiser is very good, isn't he?
- The best.
(ambulance bell)
Frank...
I'm here, darling.
Where's Frank?
He's... gone ahead.
(ambulance bell)
He's had an accident.
Hasn't he?
Yes,...
...a bad accident.
Is he dead?
Yes, he's dead.
(ambulance bell)
All right, boys, step lively.
Okay, Doc.
- Easy.
- All right.
All right, guys, lead the way.
- An atropine injection, Sister?
- Yes, 100.
- Is this the cranial case?
- Yes, that's right.
Hello, Squadron Leader.
We're all ready for you.
(rhythmic breathing)
- Dr Reeves?
- Yes.
Permit me to return your book.
- Ho-ho!
- Ah-ha!
- So it's you!
- I will introduce you to Philidor.
Cher colleague, a special case.
Court of Appeal.
- I will deliver Dr Reeves.
- As you wish.
Merci.
Be of good cheer, friend.
One of the best men in the service.
Your compatriot.
- What's his name?
- John...
- Bunyan! Yes, of course!
- And... er... how is dear Peter?
Oh, he has a fighting chance.
Oh-oh.
- Dr Frank Reeves.
- Yes.
You are familiar with
Squadron Leader Carter's case?
I am.
He has chosen you to be his counsel.
I hoped he would.
- Do you accept?
- I do.
You have very little time to prepare your case.
What facilities do you wish?
I should like to see my client and get his instructions.
I subpoena Flying Officer Trubshaw as a witness.
Certainly.
Conductor 71, you will take Dr Frank
Reeves to Squadron Leader Carter.
Psst!
- Hello, Bob.
- Wotcher, skipper.
I didn't expect to see you - not yet.
Not up there, either.
Well, it was Doc Reeves's idea.
- I subpoenaed him. Let's talk.
- Right.
- You sure they won't miss me?
- Miss you? You know me, mon ami.
That surgeon's very neat, very neat indeed.
I like his work.
- You're in good hands, Peter.
- I know.
- Look...
- I know what's coming.
- Are you sure I'm the best man?
- Quite sure.
Aren't you afraid
I may be out of my depth?
- No.
- Or that I'm no lawyer?
No.
- If he gets onto politics, I'm sunk.
- You must have something.
- Oh, just a little common sense.
- That's rare - it'll do me.
- Say yes!
- Well...
- He has no choice.
- What are we talking about, then?
All right, I need evidence.
Look at her.
Holy smoke!
- What?
- She looks like a nice girl.
- She is a nice girl.
- Hardly your type, skip.
I've fallen in love with her.
Her accent is foreign,...
...but it sounds sweet to me.
We were born thousands of miles apart,...
...but we were made for each other.
That's an excellent piece of prose.
Sorry.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
May I kiss her? Just in case, you know.
You may, but she will not know it.
Doesn't matter.
These English! What is the good of kissing a girl if she does not feel it?
Look!
- What?
- The evidence you wanted.
Her tears.
Oh, I wish I could take one with me.
You are counsel, you can do as you wish.
Why don't we wrap it up and take it with us?
Permit me.
That's it.
The only real bit of evidence we have.
Quick, we must not keep the court waiting.
The Court of Appeal sits to consider the case...
...of the Department of Records...
...versus Squadron Leader
Peter David Carter of the RAF.
He claims negligence and superior rights and responsibilities...
...arising out of that negligence.
He is appealing for remission of the date of his term on Earth...
...and for a reconsideration of his case.
It has been decided to allow this appeal.
It is for the jury to decide whether it shall be successful.
Owing to the interest aroused by the case...
...there is an unusually large audience.
We can, of course, seat everyone who wishes to be present.
The front rows are reserved for those with a special interest in the case.
Members of the jury, do not allow yourselves to be influenced...
...by anything but the facts...
...and by your conscience.
You'll have assistance from the court to help you arrive at your verdict.
The counsel for the prosecution will take his place.
The counsel for the defence will take his place.
I call upon the prosecution to open the case.
Your Honour, members of the jury,...
...this case has three issues.
Peter D Carter, an Englishman,...
...should have died on the second day of May, 1945,...
...at ten after four of the clock,
British Double Summer Time.
Due to an oversight,...
...which I hasten to state is contrary to the traditions of a great service,...
...the defendant did not die.
Therefore, issue No. 1, who is responsible?
When summoned to report
20-odd hours later,...
...the defendant refused to accompany
Conductor 71,...
...giving as his reason that in the time which he had borrowed...
...he had accumulated new responsibilities...
...of an allegedly important and permanent nature.
He claimed, in fact, that in these 20 hours...
...a young lady of good American stock...
...had fallen in love with him.
Therefore issue No. 2.
Are we to believe this?
Furthermore, he states...
...in these borrowed 20 hours...
My lord,
I object to the word "borrowed",...
...which counsel is using so emphatically.
To borrow means to get temporary use of something without being the true owner.
My client didn't get, he was given the 20 hours in question.
He didn't use something he didn't own.
He was the owner of his own life.
The next points are,...
...is this young Englishman in love with this girl of American stock?
Even more important, is she in love with him?
Why stress their nationalities?
Very important, sir. Extremely important.
- Why?
- Because we are talking of love.
(Reeves) It can happen between an Englishman and an American girl.
And... er... vice versa.
Possibly.
But what are these love affairs,
Dr Reeves?
Men and women thousands of miles away from home,...
...away from the love they left behind.
Minute sparks instead of scorching flames,...
...fading, shabby wigs instead of the rich gold of a woman's hair.
The love of the moment, Dr Reeves.
Do I call it love?
Once in a thousand times, perhaps.
And how many end in lasting marriage?
One in ten thousand.
- My case, sir!
- That, sir, is for you to prove.
When our men and women came to your country as your allies,...
...it was not to become your prisoners.
May I bring you up to date? We're living in the 20th century, not the 18th.
May I bring you up to date, sir?
We are not alive at all.
Good point.
And I am up to date, sir.
I've been watching you English from upstairs.
Your wars, your politics, your busyness.
From the tax on tea in 1766...
...to a certain report...
...on England by five members of the United States Senate in 1944.
The defendant has nothing to do with tea or senators.
But other Englishmen had, sir.
Is Peter D Carter what you'd call a good Englishman?
Yes, sir.
Do you see this glass?
Out of it Benedict Arnold drank the health of King George lll.
Does it break because it is faulty or because it is glass?
Can I tear this paper because it is defective or because it is paper?
We are all as God made us, sir,...
...but our ancestors had a deal to do in shaping us as well.
I quite agree.
The jury will please note that.
My lord, may I ask where
Mr Farlan's grandfather was born?
- The question is irrelevant.
- Could it have been England?
You need not answer that question.
I prefer to answer, Your Honour.
Grandfather left England, sir, because he didn't like it.
Granddad would've liked it even less today.
Listen.
"Well, here we are at Lord's..."
The voice of England in 1945.
"And here let me say that the weather...
...is more like cricket weather - it's stopped raining".
"Play has been resumed and the crowd of about 50,000 people...
...have discarded their macs and umbrellas...
...and settled down to enjoy the game which to people all over the world...
...more truly represents all that's English than anything else".
Do you admit that this is an English voice, sir?
(Commentator laughs)
"Wally Hammond played a delightful..."
(radio off)
The voice of America in 1945.
# Shoo, shoo, shoo, baby
(girls shriek)
# Shoo, shoo, shoo, baby
- (girls shriek)
- # Bye, bye, bye, baby
# Your papa's off to the seven seas
# Don't cry, baby
# Don't...
- #...sigh, baby
- (girls shriek)
# Bye, bye, bye, baby
# When I come back we'll have a life of ease...
I don't understand a word.
Nor do I.
(turns radio off)
But for England I'm ready to call
John Donne, Dryden, Pope,...
...Wordsworth, Coleridge,
Shelley and Keats,...
...Tennyson, Bridges...
And Milton and Shakespeare.
I concede your point.
You've already called Peter Carter.
- Is he a poet?
- He will be if you give him time.
- We are here to decide that, sir.
- I can't deny it.
(Farlan) Can the new world return to the old?
Should the vibrant humour of a young American girl...
...be stifled in the pages of Punch?
Should the swift tempo of her life...
...be slowed to the crawl of a match of cricket?
Should her accustomed native comfort...
...perforce conform to England's warm drinks, cold rooms,...
...draughty windows, smoky chimneys, faulty plumbing?
Two million houses have no windows, frequently no roof or walls.
This court is concerned with the life and death of Peter Carter,...
...not with past history or present plumbing.
- Hear, hear!
- Peter Carter's character, sir,...
...like every other human being was formed by a chain of circumstances.
As Benjamin Franklin said, for want of a nail, the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe, the horse was lost.
For want of a horse, the rider was lost.
For want of a rider, the message was lost.
For want of a message, the kingdom was lost. All for want of a nail!
You've heard of Benjamin Franklin, sir?
In George Washington's words,...
"Labour to keep alive in your breast...
...that little spark of celestial fire called conscience".
That could not have been said by an Englishman.
What was George Washington?
Conscience, Mr Farlan.
Are you insinuating that something is wrong with my conscience?
- I am.
- Your Honour, I protest.
I am trying to give a full picture of this case to the jury.
You are trying to prejudice the jury, sir.
I see that they've been selected from many races, creeds and nationalities.
I cannot believe them interested in ancient grudges...
...nor in present grumblings about draughty windows.
I don't need to prejudice the jury.
They're already prejudiced and with good reason!
You can't pick one that isn't.
Look closely at the members of the jury.
- The first member is...
- Jean-Marie Barault, French!
Has a century passed without war between England and France?
- The second member is...
- Gregorius Johannes Bund, sir.
The Boer War, Dr Reeves.
The third member is...
- Ivan Berdei, Russki.
- What?
I am Russian.
The Crimean War, Dr Reeves.
And you, sir?
Chang Chi Min, Peking.
Don't forget England's attack on China in 1857.
Occupying unprotected Peking.
And you, sir?
Raha Tejpalal from the Punjab.
Think of India, Dr Reeves.
Think of India.
And you, sir, you are...?
James Monaghan, Irish.
Choose a new jury anywhere, Dr Reeves.
It will always be prejudiced against your country.
My lord, I wish to take counsel for the prosecution's advice.
I challenge the jury and request that a new one be chosen.
Chosen from where, Dr Reeves?
- Mr Farlan said anywhere.
- Except England.
Why not? Where else have the rights of the individual been held so high?
In America, sir, where these rights are held to be inalienable!
I doubt if you have more freedom than England.
An Englishman thinks as he likes in religion and politics.
It isn't what a man thinks and says, it's when and where and to whom.
A man with a flint and steel striking sparks over a wet blanket is one thing,...
...but striking them over a tinderbox is another!
An American baby sucks in freedom with the milk of the breast at which he hangs.
A man can see further, sir, from the top of Boston State House,...
...and see more worth seeing than from the pyramids, turrets and steeples...
...of all the places of the world.
No smoke, sir,...
...no fog, sir,...
...and a clean sweep from the outer light and the sea beyond...
...to the New Hampshire mountains!
Yes, sir, there are great truths...
...higher than mountains and broader than seas...
...that people look for from the tops of our hills!
America, sir,...
...is the only place where man is full grown!
(applause)
Then I choose a jury of Americans.
Of Americans, sir, selected from every walk of American life.
If one has fought in the Wars of Independence,...
...I want one who has fought with us against our enemies in this century.
If the third has a mind that can only think 170 years back,...
...I want the fourth to be thinking
170 years ahead.
I cannot deny that I hope,...
...that I know that this jury will be prejudiced in favour of my case...
...for I am pleading for the rights of the individual against the system.
But it is also against the law, Dr Reeves,...
...the eternal law of the universe.
Nothing is stronger than the law.
The whole universe is built upon it.
This is a court of justice, not of law.
My lord, I ask for a new jury of American citizens.
Do you agree, Mr Farlan?
I'd welcome such a jury, Your Honour.
The jury will stand.
The jury will retire and a new jury will take their place.
Robert Dupont, American citizen.
Lt Pete Vandereyk, American citizen.
Alexander Barbanov, American citizen.
George Wong, American citizen.
Jefferson Lincoln Brown,...
...American citizen.
Patrick Aloysius Mahoney,
American citizen.
The jury will be seated.
Counsel for the defence.
Here in this rose is my case.
What is my case?
I entirely agree with Mr Farlan.
Has Peter Carter fallen in love during the allotted extra...
Borrowed.
...disputed extra 20 hours he had or hasn't he?
Has someone - the name is unimportant - fallen in love with him?
Now, here are two young people who would never have met...
...but for a mistake higher up,...
...penalised for the most natural and simple thing in the world.
They fell in love.
Here in this tear...
...are love and truth and friendship.
Those qualities alone can build a new world today...
...and must build a better one tomorrow.
That is my case...
...and, upon it, I demand a verdict that Peter Carter shall live.
Your Honour, we feel the defendant and this young girl...
...should be given a chance to be heard.
My lord, nothing is impossible.
The court will adjourn.
No reason to be without the dimension of time. They will not disturb us.
It would help establish a true picture of the conditions.
Very well.
- I call Squ...
- My diagnosis was right.
Fine avascular meningeal adhesions binding the optic nerve to the brain.
Similar adhesions between chiasm and brain.
Did I tell you about my operation?
Dr Reeves, we are not here...
...to check your diagnosis, but to question this young man.
Quite right.
I call Squadron Leader Peter D Carter.
- Hello, Peter.
- Hello, Frank. How's the op going?
- Fine. Leiser's a good man.
- He'd better be!
Peter Carter, you are on the witness stand.
- You are under oath, understand?
- Yes, Mr Farlan.
- You know me, sir?
- No mistaking you.
Your smile is not unattractive, sir.
Did you use it to enamour this young American lady?
- I love her, sir.
- Answer the question.
Would you repeat the question?
It had "enamoured" in it.
Never mind the exact question.
Did you consciously try to influence the emotions of this American lady?
- We fell in love before we met.
- You claim you love her.
- I do.
- Can you prove it?
Well, give me time, sir. 50 years will do.
But can you prove it?
Can a starving man prove he's hungry except by eating?
Would you die for her?
I would!
But... er... I'd rather live.
Young devil!
Your Honour,
I apologise for the expression.
- Your witness.
- No questions.
Conductor 71.
- Monsieur?
- Is the young lady available?
She sleeps.
Sleeps? The jury will note that.
I put her to sleep.
Indeed? Why?
To enable you to call her, sir.
The jury will please note that.
I do call her, Your Honour.
You are before the High Court in the case of Peter Carter.
You have been called as a witness by the prosecution.
You will tell the truth.
This gentleman is counsel for the prosecution.
Child, where were you born?
In Boston, sir.
- Do you know this man?
- I think so.
- You think so?
- I only met him a few days ago.
You hardly know him.
How can you think you love him?
- But I do love him.
- Nonsense.
I object.
Counsel will withdraw the expression.
It's all right, he's right.
There's no sense in love.
Wisdom still flowers in Boston.
- Can you prove that you love him?
- How can I?
Would you be willing to die for him?
Yes.
Would you take his place in the balance sheet?
- Yes.
- Don't believe her!
- Stand aside!
- You've no right!
- How dare you address me like that!
- You must obey.
Of all the dirty tricks!
- This is contempt of court!
- Don't answer any more questions.
Do you realise you've forfeited any chance of winning your case?
You won't get June as well!
Your Honour, members of the jury...
I'm afraid he really does love her.
Your witness.
June, you know me well.
Do you trust me?
Yes, Frank, I trust you.
It is absolutely necessary you take
Peter's place in the other world.
Have you gone mad?!
If you love him, step onto this staircase and come with us.
- You are mad!
- It is the only way to prove your love.
- I do love him.
- No!
- I ask you to restrain him.
- Granted.
June.
Take care, Dr Reeves.
In the whole universe nothing is stronger than the law.
Goodbye, darling.
Yes, Mr Farlan, nothing is stronger than the law in the universe,...
...but on Earth nothing is stronger than love.
Members of the jury, as Sir Walter Scott is always saying,...
"...In peace, love tunes the shepherd's reed,...
...in war, he mounts the warrior's steed".
"In halls, in gay attire is seen,...
...in hamlets, dances on the green".
"Love rules the court, the camp, the grove...
...and men below and saints above".
"For love is heaven, and heaven is love".
Will you please consider your verdict?
Case for the defendant, Your Honour.
Bravo!
The appeal is granted.
There now remains the new date on Squadron Leader Carter's file.
Will both counsel approve it?
- Does that satisfy you, Dr Reeves?
- Very generous, my lord.
Do you agree, Mr Farlan?
Isn't that a little too much, Your Honour?
I agree.
My lord, I hope this will not establish a precedent.
- (both) I object!
- Er, you, sir.
- You, sir.
- The rights of the common man...
- The uncommon man.
- Exactly!
The rights of the uncommon man must always be respected.
(Farlan) Exactly!
Keep his head firm.
- Tell the nurse I'll send the notes.
- Yes, sir.
- Congratulations.
- An interesting case.
Peter,...
...don't forget your book.
Frank...
Frank...
Frank.
Hello.
Hello.
We won.
I know, darling.

Very good, Sylvia. Don't be upset.
Are you ready, Amelia?

Believe me if all those
Endearing young charms
Which I gaze on so fondly today
Were to change by tomorrow
And fleet in my arms,
Like fairy gifts fading away
Thou would'st still be adored
As this moment thou art...
What's wrong, Andrew?
They're arguing.
Dear great Grandma...
...and dear great Grandpa...
No, No, Larry, you mustn't.
I simply won't let you do it.
For 50 years you've kept me from publishing this.
Because I love you.
I don't want you to be laughed at.
But, at least, I want to read it to my family.
They'll never believe it unless they hear it from me.
I've heard it for 50 long years and I still don't believe it.
Now, come on dear, the children are waiting.
They might think we're arguing!
But I'm not arguing, my love.
This story is true.
It tells what happened to me.
Now Larry.
You just don't believe in miracles.
Don't try to tell it, darling.
Nobody believes in miracles nowadays.
...gloomy winter
Then reigns o'er us no more.
I would not die in Springtime...
...When all is bright around...
...And fair young flowers are peeping...
...From out the silent ground.
When life is on the water...
...And joy upon the shore
For winter, gloomy winter...
Then reigns o'er us no more.
I would not die in Springtime...
What is this?
A newspaper office or a saloon?
A newspaper office Mr Gordon.
- Have a drink Mr Gordon?
- I never drink.
I mean in this office.
But, Mr Gordon.
This is my party.
I'm saying farewell to the dead.
Dead?
- Who died, Stevens?
- 500 people.
500 obituaries that I've written.
Well, no more obit's for me.
Remember the front page is written in the morning.
If you are going to be a reporter, from now on better get to sleep early
I can go to sleep right now Mr Gordon.
Hey look!
I'm going to sleep right now!
Careful, my boy. You're laying right in the middle of 1843.
Well, not a bad place to sleep Pops!
A bed of ancient news!
Well, you just be careful with my files.
Ah, there's nothing as dead as yesterday's news!
Yesterday's news?
You've no imagination, young man.
News is what happens.
What's the difference whether it happens 50 years ago...
...or tomorrow?
You mean, Will happen tomorrow.
No. Time is only an illusion.
Look. March 18, 1875.
To the people then, this was the future; wasn't it?
Well, supposing we were all living on that date in 1875...
...and I arrived with this book.
I can tell you everything that will happen.
Well, give me the one for the year we're living in now Pop... and you can name your own price!
But it's here, my boy.
They're all here.
Look.
19th century
20th century.
I can't quite see the 20th, Pop.
Unfortunately we can't.
But if we could...
Look...
We know what will happen in say...1906.
That's too far away, Pop. I'd like to know what'll happen next year.
No. Just 24 hours from now!
I did the front page with my first story.
That's what I want Pop, tomorrow's newspaper. How much?
No, Larry. No.
Don't ask a thing like that
Oh, come on.
Come on, lets have it Pop, Huh?
I wish I could
Then you'd learn it's no good to know the future
We've all got to die someday..
...but, if we knew the day.
Even if it was 20 years off...
I'd have a corking good time for 20 years.
My boy. Every day of your life would be poisoned.
If I knew where I could get tomorrows newspaper...
...I'd give 10 years of my life for it.
How do you know you've got 10 years?
He's got you there, Larry.
Forget about tomorrow.
Do you want me to tell you what's gonna happen in the next 5 minutes?
Sure.
- We'll all be thirsty.
There's no more beer.
I'm gonna hope that somebody else buys it.
- Wanna come along, Pop?
- No, I haven't time.
- See you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Wait a minute, fellas.
Wait a minute.
If you're interested in the future, look there.
Cigolini.
With a name like that he'll tell your future in Italian.
Yeah, and you won't know what he's talking about.
He won't either.
He's just a faker.
- Yeah, but look at the girl!
- Yeah, she's pretty; that's no fake.
That's a fake too.
They all look good on posters.
What we need is a drink.
Come on.
Inside, you'll find she's fair, fat and forty!
And now, my friend. Tell me, what is the number in the case of your watch.
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- You have a watch, haven't you?
- Oh, for sure.
- May I see it please?
- Well, I had it...
Well, look...
There is your watch now.
It's funny how these trifles get misplaced.
Sylvia. Do you hear me?
I hear you.
Now, listen carefully.
Do you see inside the case of this watch?
I will try.
Tell me, what is the number inside the case of this watch?
Two, Seven, Nine...
Oh, I can't.
You've got to Sylvia.
I compel you.
Three, Three, Five...
...Ninety-four.
Aha!
Is that correct my friend?
Thank you very much.
Thank you Sir. Step right down
- Can we have another chair please?
- Yes, Sir.
Thank you.
I beg your pardon.
My friend, she cannot hear you she only hears the voice of The Cigolini.
She is in a trance.
Then tell her I beg her pardon.
Young man, she is unaware of your presence...
...she can only see the invisible.
Could you make me invisible?
That you can do for yourself.
By sitting down!
Thank you.
And now, my friend, what is your question?
I gave it to you.
Sure, Sure.
Tell me, my friend, is this your handwriting?
That's it alright.
We get this question here every night.
Miss Sylvia has unveiled this part of the future.
I'm very sorry my friend but you lose your bet.
William McKinley is a very worthy man.
Sorry, Sorry...
...but the republican party don't have no chance
The next President of United States will be William Jennings Bryan.
Thank you, my friend.
That is all.
And now ladies and gentlemen, at this time...
Just a minute, there's a señor here who don't seem to agree with me.
Tell me, what are you a republican?
Professor, I have a question.
It concerns a certain young lady.
And you want to know if she's going to have the misfortune to marry you?
Is that it?
All I want to know is whether she'll have lunch with me tomorrow.
Young señor wants to know... if the girl he loves is going to have lunch with him tomorrow.
- Yes, she will.
- Thank you.
But I'd like to know where we'll meet.
My friend, that you have to arrange with the lady yourself.
That I'd like to do, but she can't hear me. She's in a trance.
Just a minute, my good friend...
...Cigolini has put the young lady's mind to sleep...
...and Cigolini is not sure just when she is going to awaken.
And that is why Miss Sylvia will be unable to accept...
...any social engagements.
Hello. Remember me?
No, I'm afraid I don't.
But you answered my question.
I was asleep.
Besides, you were very rude
How do you know I was if you were asleep?
May I take you home?
No, Thank you.
You mean, I can't come inside?
I always go home alone.
105 North Elm Street. Driver.
And take it easy.
Go slow.
No, go fast
I'm in a hurry.
I'm in no hurry.
Take your time.
Now, listen to me
Who hired this cab?
The gentleman did, Miss. He's kept me here waiting for half an hour.
It's a pleasure. You don't mind my riding with you in my own cab,do you?
I certainly do.
- Cabbie.
- I'm sorry, I've hired this cab.
You've hired it, huh?
Well, why don't you get into it?
Alright cabbie, take 'em away.
Twenty-three skidoo!
Thank you, Professor.
And don't try to see her again.
You'd better drive on.
My uncle might see you.
Goodnight.
I can look into the future myself.
You're going to see me again.
Very soon.
You see? My prediction was right.
I told you I'd see you again very soon.
Oh, be careful.
Go away.
Oh no. Not 'til I know whether you're prediction is right or not.
- Prediction?
- Don't you remember?
Señor would like to know...
...if the girl he loves will have lunch with him tomorrow.
You said she will.
I never remember anything
I say when I'm in a trance.
Well, in case you do I'll be waiting for you at the Evening News office tomorrow 'til 1 o'clock.
Goodnight.
Wait...
...the name is Stevens.
Lawrence Stevens.
Just ask for Larry.
Larry!
Larry!
Larry!
Oh, it's you Pop.
You gave me a scare.
Don't tell me you've been drinking alone?
What are you doing here so late?
Didn't I tell you time doesn't exist?
I was waiting for you, Larry.
For me?
I didn't say I was coming back.
I was just on my way home.
So am I
But I wanted to give you this first.
Well, it's the "Evening News"
I've read it.
Maybe not.
You better go home and sleep it off Pop.
I never felt better in my life.
Goodnight, Larry.
Wait and I'll take you home
No thanks, my boy.
We go different ways.
Don't lose it.
Better hurry up, Mr Stevens.
Mrs Keever, today I start a new life.
Starting a little late in the morning.
Well I overslept
I had wonderful dreams
Better take a coat; it's a little chilly today.
Don't you think
Love might keep me warm.
You call this the month of May?
Last night fog, cold this morning.
How goes it, Joe?
Not so good.
Still looking for a job.
Mind if I take a look at your paper?
I haven't got one.
Sure you have one here in your coat.
"Evening News"
That's last night's paper.
I don't mind.
It's the want ads I'm after.
This aint last nights paper.
It's todays.
No, Joe. Todays "Evening News" hasn't gone to press yet...
It must be last nights.
What day is today?
Wednesday
But this says Wednesday
Wednesday?
They must have made a mistake.
What day is today?
Wednesday, all day!
Snow?
It didn't snow yesterday did it?
No.
"Unseasonable snow fall
8 o'clock in the morning"
I didn't see any snow, did you?
How could I? There wasn't any.
Yes, it's Wednesday the whole day.
And what a day!
Snow in May.
"8 o'clock in the morning..."
What time is it?
Can't you see for yourself?
Here's something!
They need a waiter at Beacon & Fifth.
I guess I'll get right over there
Joe!
I tell you we don't need any waiters.
But this paper says...
We don't need any waiters.
Understand?
Then why waste peoples time putting ads in the paper?
You've probably got the wrong address
Here it is. You say you didn't put an ad in the paper for a waiter?
No we did not.
I tell you we don't need any waiters.
Get out of here you butterfingers!
This is the last dishes you break here!
You are fired!
Get your head on Maisie...
...take a dollar from the till and put an ad in the paper right away.
What are you staring at me for?
In the morning paper?
No, I want another man right away.
Put it in the "Evening News".
What do you want?
Nothing.
Nothing.
- Where's Pop Benson?
- I haven't seen him, Larry.
Where's Pop?
Search me, Larry.
- Have you seen Pop?
- No, I haven't Larry.
- Hey, what's your hurry?
- I've got to find Pop.
The old man hasn't shown up yet Larry.
Stevens.
Mr Gordon.
Do you know where Pop Benson is?
Never mind about Pop Benson.
You come into my office.
But I've got to find Pop.
Something's happened
I don't understand.
Something's happened that
I understand very well. You're late.
I know but when I tell you what happened.
Let me tell you what's going to happen...
If you're ever late in this office again...
Mr Gordon. Who's covering the Melba concert at the opera house?
Now don't tell me you want to be a music critic
But suppose something happens there.
A front page story... the biggest news of the day.
In that case, I'll send an experienced reporter. Not you.
But I ought to be there before it happens
You're either crazy or drunk.
Still drunk, I mean.
I'm going to show you something that will change your mind
Your fired!
You can't fire me. I quit.
You quit? You...?
I mean, I will quit tonight if you haven't given me a raise
A raise?
Yes, for the biggest news story of the day
Set up a 4 column headline right now
Bandits steal cash at opera house while Melba sings
At ten minutes past two.
Hey, Did you get fired?
Yes, but I'm gonna get a raise.
Can I help you?
Can we all help you?
I'm looking for Mr Stevens.
Oh, I'll get him for you.
- Larry, she's here
- Who?
Don't kid me. You know who.
How did you do it?
- I forgot.
- Yeah, you forgot.
Miss Smith, this is a day of miracles
I was just passing by Mr Stevens.
I was waiting for you.
Yes, I knew you intended to wait so I ...
...I felt it was my duty to tell you that...
...I can't have lunch with you.
Oh, I see.
You think we haven't known each other long enough.
You're very understanding Mr Stevens.
Well, that's too bad, I...
I could have told you of something wonderful that's happened.
You know why I came...
...tell me your secret.
How would you like to hear the Melba concert?
You're changing the subject.
Oh no I'm not.
That's part of the secret.
Something is going to happen at the opera house.
We haven't much time to get there.
Oh, I couldn't go with you Mr Stevens.
But what's going to happen?
I'll tell you
Two Sir?
What time is it please?
Five past two.
The concert has just started Sir.
We're late.
No, No, we're a few minutes early.
I bet you a pair of tickets I can tell you how much you've taken in
3675 dollars
You lose my friend. 3670 even.
Must be a mistake somewhere.
I guess I'll have to buy that pair.
How much?
- 2.50 each.
Five dollars.
Five dollars.
Well, that makes it right.
3675 dollars
But that isn't all the secret is it?
Oh no, that's just the money that's going to be stolen.
Come inside, you'll be safer.
- Tickets, please.
- We'll stand right here.
- That's not permitted, Sir.
- We're leaving in a few minutes.
Mr Stevens. I don't want to leave in a few minutes.
The show will be over.
You mean Madame Melba?
The big show isn't there, it's here in the lobby.
Listen, Sylvia...
What is going to happen?
There's going to be a hold up.
What kind of a story is that?
3 bandits will come into the lobby
Listen to the music.
I can hear that later.
No, It's going to happen right now.
They'll pretend to ask for tickets...
...then one man will draw a pistol...
It happened.
It happened!
Hurry up driver.
Faster, Faster!
Why did you run away?
To get my story in the first edition
I think you'd better let me out here.
- No, No, No. I need you.
- What for?
The editor will think I'm faking.
I have to have a witness.
But Mr Stevens.
How did you know...?
Do you think you're the only one who can read the future?
Mr Stevens.
What kind of a cock-and-bull story is this?
Mr Gordon. Don't waste time. The papers are going to press any minute
- What time did you say this happened?
- 10 minutes ago, I was there
Are you trying to tell me you wrote all this in 10 minutes?
Don't ask questions. Please, if you have any sense, print my story
You'll pick those up again.
Miss Smith, tell him what you saw.
Well, I didn't see anything.
No, what I mean is,
I was listening to Melba and...
...when Mr Stevens pulled me out it was all over.
What was all over, young lady?
Well, the things he wrote.
I fired you once.
Now, do I have to throw you out?
It will be printed.
You will see it on the front page.
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be alright.
Hello Inspector.
Anything wrong?
Plenty. There's been a hold up at the opera house
Hold the press! Copyist!
- Copyist!
- Yes Sir.
Set this up in paragraphs.
Page one; two columns square
- Shoot it through.
- What's the headline, Chief?
How about "Bandits steal cash at opera house while Melba sings"?
That's it.
By Lawrence Stevens.
- By Lawrence Stevens.
- Yes Sir.
I guess maybe I was a little hasty.
Tell me now, how did you do it?
I'll come back later and talk to you about that raise, chief.
Thank you, Inspector.
You came just in the nick of time.
Stevens. We'd like to know a little more about this.
Sure, sure. But I can't identify the men. I didn't see their faces.
I see. You know everything about the job except who they were.
- That's just about the size of it, yes
- I see.
- Is this the man?
- Yes sir, that's him.
- Now wait a minute, you can't talk to me like that.
- Shut up
Take it easy, Inspector. Stevens is the best reporter I've got..
I wanna find out what he was doing at the opera house during the holdup.
I took this young lady to the Melba concert.
You don't need to be modest, Larry.
Tell him the truth.
You told me this morning what would happen.
Just what I figured.
Oh but please, he didn't do anything wrong
I was there with him.
I'll question you later young woman.
Please wait outside.
Keep your hands off of that young lady...
- She had nothing to do with this...
- Just a minute.
Just how long have you been tied up with this gang?
What gang?
- The four men who pulled this hold-up.
- There were only three.
There were four.
You were the fourth
I said there were only...
Don't pull me like that.
Now look, Stevens, you're not as smart as you think you are
By Lawrence Stevens.
His first day as a reporter and he gets his name on the front page.
He's got a great future when he gets out of jail
- You think they can put him in jail?
- Of course they can.
- But what for?
- For being an accomplice
Don't worry. He won't get more than five or ten years.
With a good lawyer.
Why don't you have dinner with me and we'll talk about it.
Yeah, we'll all talk about it.
Stevens, you're the most stubborn man
I've ever known.
Now, what were names of these three fellas.
I'll put you in jail Stevens for the rest of your natural life.
If you don't tell me the truth
Larry, for heavens sake tell him the truth
- Mr Gordon, where's Pop Benson?
- Stop asking that!
Look, how did you know that this hold-up was going to happen?
Alright, I'll tell you but you won't believe me.
I read it in a newspaper last night
What newspaper?
Todays "Evening News" .
Stop this tomfoolery!
Wait, I'll prove it to you.
Look, here it is.
Isn't that todays newspaper?
Well I'm asking you
Isn't that todays newspaper?
And what is this?
But they were all just printed today.
I got mine last night.
Larry, a joke is a joke but don't carry it too far.
Let's go to headquarters.
Oh please, please!
Please, he's done nothing wrong.
I know he hasn't
You keep out of this, young woman.
Now one last chance.
How did you know the hold-up was going to happen?
- I read it in that..
- Shut up!
- Get him out of here.
- Come on.
Wait, I told him...
...what was going to happen at the opera house.
Take him away!
Take him away!
Sylvia, you can't help me.
Inspector, don't believe a word she says to you
How did you know about this hold-up young woman?
Sometimes I see things that are going to happen.
Can you see what's going to happen now?
Well, you're coming along with us.
Did she show up yet?
No and I can't understand it.
She has never been late.
Too bad. Mr Beckstein here is scouting for Barnum & Bailey
Mr Beckstein.
Gee, what a thrill.
It's been the dream of my life to go on tour with you people.
I'm afraid we aren't interested in mind reading acts.
They come a dime a dozen
- But mine is sensational.
- I can't wait.
Wait Mr Beckstein.
Here she comes now.
- Where have you been?
-Sorry Uncle Oscar, It's not my fault
Listen, Mr Beckstein is here from
Barnum & Bailey's, now come on get on your clothes in there we're on right away
Hurry up!
Don't stall, you hear!
Oh Gee, Mr Beckstein. You know, when I was a young kid this high...
One moment, Cigolini.
- What do you want?
- Just a little information
I'm also interested in your act
You hear that Mr Beckstein?
You've got some competition.
The young lady tells me you can read the future. Is that right?
Future? Past, present and future!
Then you could have predicted what happened today?
Why, sure, sure, anything.
Then your niece was telling the truth when she said you predicted this.
Sure, sure.
Oh, sure, we predicted this
It happens all the time.
Now are you going to stay and see our act Mr Beckstein?
I think I will.
That's great, I know you're going to like it.
You're very busy.
I'll see you after the performance
Thanks. Say, by the way, what were you doing with my niece?
I'm police Inspector Mulrooney.
Police? and if I were you, the next time you make a prediction like this...
...I would inform the police.
You'll find it safer.
Professor Cigolini...
...How about predicting something that will happen now...
...tonight or tomorrow?
Señor, my medium is far sighted...
...things that are too close sometimes are out of focus
Then how did she predict the hold-up that took place today?
You're right my friend, I forgot.
Sometimes she can see things like that
Sometimes?
What about now?
I'm sorry but our time is up
You'll have to ask that question some other time
Will something happen tonight?
A crime?...
...fire, theft, murder or something like that?
Sylvia, I know you are very tired but... do you see anything going to happen tonight?
I can't hear you
I told you she was very tired
She can't even hear me
Speak louder!
Sylvia try, try hard
What do you see?
I see nothing.
That shows it's a moonless night.
How can anybody see anything in the dark
Thank you, Professor
I am not in the dark...
...I see an open and shut case.
Wait a minute, Señor.
Wait...
Now... now I see in the darkness.
It is night.
Yes, tonight.
I see a river...a bridge...
I see a woman walking
Then what happens?
She jumps.
She's in the water.
She goes under.
I don't see her anymore.
All you've got to do is talk, son, and you'll be out of here
Just tell us where we can collar them desperados.
Try and remember.
I tell you I don't know.
I'll be outside if you want to talk to me.
Think it over
It wasn't worth 10 years of your life, was it?
Pop!
Pop, where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you
Oh just around, my boy.
Did I meet you last night or did I dream it?
Tell me, did you give me a newspaper?
It didn't do you any good did it Larry?
Oh Pop, I'm in a jam. Nobody believes me. I can't get out of here
Why don't you say something? What are you looking at me like that for?
I'm kinda surprised to see you here, that's all
I figured you'd be on your way to the river by this time
You ought to be there a little after midnight. You've got to be.
Who says so?
Why, I just read it.
Don't tell me that's the next tomorrow's paper.
Isn't that what you want?
No!
- You want to tell me something?
- No!
Yes!
Maybe... wait.
Pop, does it say anything in the paper about those bandits?
Here it is.
- They've been arrested.
- When were they? Where?
Tomorrow morning in the Union Bank.
The police were waiting for them.
You wrote that!
What about me?
Oh, you'll be a hero
- For telling the police?
- No.
I better read it to you
"Unknown woman makes suicide leap.
Jumps to death from 9th street bridge.
Larry Stevens.
"Evening News" Reporter...
...makes heroic attempt at rescue in river.
Body not yet recovered
- Shortly after midnight..."
- Now I don't believe a word of it.
Why, it says so here
But I'm being held here.
I can't get away.
Even if I could
I wouldn't go to the river
Even if I did I wouldn't jump in
What kind of monkey do you think I am... to risk my life for a woman I don't know... when I do know she can't be saved.
Don't ask me my boy.
I'm no prophet.
- I'm just reading this.
- Enough...
...I never want to hear of that paper again.
You hollering for me?
No, get outta here and leave me alone.
Look, if you let me out I'll tell you where you can get those bandits.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Tomorrow morning at the Union Bank.
All you have to do is wait for them.
Come along, Mister.
Alright, Stevens, Alright
We'll be waiting at the bank.
But if you're fooling us, remember we know where to pick you up
You can go now.
Thanks, Inspector.
Where's Miss Smith?
I owe her an apology.
Miss Smith disappeared after the show Mr Stevens
Her uncle says he don't know where she's gone.
That's right, I don't know.
But he knows.
Listen, this guy's trying to steal my niece. She's infatuated with him.
Say that again please.
Listen you, you whippersnapper
I'll hit you over the head...
Alright, shut up the both of you.
Before you go Stevens I'd like to get to the bottom of this.
At what time did the girl tell you about the hold-up?
- She didn't tell me at all.
- Of course she didn't.
- Now you're lying.
- Listen, I aint lying.
A couple of hours ago you admitted it
I didn't know you was a police Inspector
Oh, I see
You don't understand. I was just putting on an act for Beckstein
That's Barnum & Baileys big man.
Don't you understand?
How could you...
You're an intelligent man?
How could you believe that we could predict anything that we don't know nothing about?
And by the way, who heard the prediction?
Did you hear it?
I didn't
No, but I did hear the prediction tonight?
Ah, that's bunk Inspector.
Bunk!
How could she know anything about a bridge and a river and a woman commiting suicide?
Now, how could she?
Did Sylvia say that?
Shut up. She was just trying to get us out of a tight hole. You too.
Bridge...river?
Did she say the body would never be found?
She didn't say that.
- Now...
- She didn't know.
What is this nonsense?
Don't let that guy get away.
You'd keep him in here if you know your business
If I know my business, you're coming with me.
- Wait.
- Come on.
What happened?
What's the matter?
A woman just jumped in the river!
I saw her!
Save her, Save her!
- Somebody better dive in.
- That's the idea.
- Go ahead, jump.
- I can't swim.
- I can't either.
- Niether can I.
Officer, Officer.
Can you see her?
No, no we can't see anything.
Then there is no use for me diving in.
I better get a boat.
Hurry, Officer. Hurry!
Did she do it?
Now, don't get excited.
We'll save her.
- Oh, I know you won't.
- You know, eh? Are you her husband?
- No, let me go
- Wait.
Just who are you anyway?
Larry Stevens. "Evening News".
What a man!
If I could swim, I'd do it too.
- What was his name?
- Stevens.  "Evening News".
What they won't do to get a story!
Sylvia, Sylvia!
Larry.
What are you doing here?
Now you've spoiled everything.
Sylvia darling,
I knew you were in danger.
I wasn't.
I was just trying to save you.
It looks like we were both trying to save each other.
I had to make a prediction...
...and I had to make it look like it really happened.
Oh you wonderful, foolish little darling.
- Yes, but I didn't know...
- You didn't know what?
That the water would be so cold.
Now I know the newspaper was wrong.
Newspaper?
Oh, never mind. You're here alive.
I found you.
There's the boat.
Look! Her hat floating.
Her hat maybe, but the girl must have gone down like a stone.
Let's go on further.
Yeah, no hurry. It'll be just another case of body not recovered
Did you hear that?
That's what I want them to think.
"Body not recovered"
Gee Whizz! and if I get it that'll be the headline
What if they find me here
Don't worry, they won't
I know they won't
Now you can put me down.
No, No you're dripping wet.
How can I explain a girl's tax in the hallway?
Open the door.
Sylvia?
Alright, you can come in now.
Hey, you're just a little thing aren't you.
I feel perfectly silly
How can I go home like this?
There's nobody on the street this time of night...
...and besides, you look very respectable.
You need a shave.
What's the matter with your tie?
I nearly choked myself trying to tie it the way you do.
Let me do it
Sorry
Look, you take both ends like this, you see? and you put right over left
No, you cross left over right
I'm all mixed up
Oh, it's backwards for me, come over here.
Now, that's better.
Watch closely. You might have to do this for your husband some day
You know, on you this suit looks good
It's the first time I've liked it
I'm sorry, I looked in the closet and couldn't find a girls dress anyplace.
I should hope not.
As a matter of fact, I don't care.
Well I'm glad you're not the jealous type
What would I be jealous of?
Well if you cared at all
I'd have to tell you that...
...I'm a very busy character...
...I haven't got time to be interested in girls.
Last night in the cab you didn't act like a man... who's not interested in girls.
Last night? Great Scott!
What?
Was it only last night we met.
You mean to tell me, all this happened since last night?
Sure, I met the old man on the way home after I left you.
Give me your newspaper
I want to read it.
Oh, he didn't give it to me tonight, he only read it to me.
Well, the old man was outside the window and I...
Oh, what's the use?
Nobody believes us
Larry, you have a wonderful imagination...
You ought to join our act. Maybe you could read a number inside a watch
By the way, how do you do that trick?.
We magicians never reveal our secrets.
Right, Larry?
But I have no secrets,
I'm telling you the truth.
Last night, when the old man gave me the paper I didn't even read it...
...but this morning...
Larry!
Oh Larry, this is awful.
I fell asleep.
Did you?
Why didn't you wake me?
I guess I was dreaming too.
Besides, your shoes aren't dry yet.
I can't wait any longer
I'll have to put them on
Oh, it's shrunk.
What do I do now?
No, No don't get out.
Please go. Don't stay here.
What's the matter?
- My key
- Have you lost it?
I left it in my purse in the dressing room.
What about your window?
Thank goodness I left that unlocked.
- I'll help you.
- No, No please.
Please go, the cab man is watching.
Are you sure you can make it?
Yes, yes goodnight.
You can go now.
Yes, sir.
Goodnight.
What's the trouble Mrs O'Connor?
It's a burglar. I just seen him climb into Miss Sylvia's window
- Did you call Cigolini?
- He's not in his room
Be careful with that thing it might go off
I don't like to handle it.
- Oh, give it to me
- Sure.
A burglar! What are we going to do?
Don't make a sound.
Maybe he'll go away
He'd go a whole lot faster if we all scream for the Police.
You stay right here
I'll go find a policeman.
I'm not afraid.
Poor girl, she must still be asleep.
Maybe he's threatening her.
But there's a light in the window.
Look.
That's one girl I wouldn't have believed it about.
Oh, these theatrical people, they're all...
You folks are up a bit late!
We was waitin' for ya.
Thank you, that's mighty kind of you dear ladies, but...
I was being entertained tonight by an old friend of mine.
Inspector Mulrooney
He wanted my advice.
Tell me, have you seen my niece?
Indeed we have.
I was a bit worried, she was kind of nervous tonight.
Indeed
Yes, she went off by herself.
I guess she went to bed early
Well if she did, she got up again because we saw her at the window
The poor girl is probably worried about me. I'll tell her I'm home.
Sylvia, are you awake dear?
She'll not be answering you Professor and you're cooing like a pigeon
She must be awake if you saw her at the window.
That's not all I seen.
I seen a man.
And he's in there now.
What is it?
What is it uncle Oscar?
What's wrong?
Just some nosey people trying to scandalize your name, that's all
What do you mean saying there is a man in my nieces room?
Just a bunch of scandalmongers, that's what you are!
Making me bust in on an innocent young girl at this time of the night
I saw a man.
I'll prove you're all liars.
Come in here and see for yourself.
Look everywhere. Look in that closet.
Look under that bed.
Get out! Get out all of you!
Now get out yourself!
Come on I see you! Get out from under that bed or I'll pull you out!
He can't run very fast without his shoes.
Hey, which way did he go?
- Who?
The fella' that jumped out that window.
The guy that jumped out that window!?
Smart guy, huh?
Come on
Wait a minute, officer let me explain
You can explain it at the station.
- Have they found Stevens body yet?
- They're still dragging the river
Sweeney, have you finished his obituary?
Yes sir
Refer to him as Lawrence Stevens, not Larry. Give it a little dignity.
- Cut it down it's too long.
- Yes sir.
- Any further details?
- Only that he jumped into the river.
And he just couldn't swim.
That's all.
- He would have made a fine reporter.
- You bet he would.
Oh, a swell guy he was.
Mr Gordon. Mr Gordon.
- Stevens!
- Larry!
- I've a great story, have I got a job?
- Yes.
- Do I get a raise?
- Yes, but what's the story?
The police just trapped those opera house bandits.
- Where?
- The Union Bank. I was there.
Sit down, write it, take all the space you want. Give him this desk
- Kill his obit'.
- Obit'?
- Yes you're supposed to be drowned.
- Yeah a dead hero.
Didn't you try to save a woman in the river last night.
Start writing.
Change these headlines.
Larry Stevens. "Evening News" reporter. makes heroic attempt...
...at rescue in river
- Lawrence Stevens.
- I said Larry.
Now, let him alone, he's got to make the first edition
Now be a pal, Larry.
How come you were at the Union Bank when this happened?
Just passing by
Listen, hero...
How did you happen to cross the 9th
St bridge just as the woman jumped?
Just passing by
Don't tell me you were just passing by the opera house yesterday.
- Yeah, I got a nose for news.
- Come on, how'd you do it?
-You really wanna know? I'll tell you
- Yes.
- Do you believe in miracles?
- No.
Tell the truth Larry.
Who tipped you off?
Anything I want to know
I can find out.
Mr Gordon. Could I have an advance of a hundred dollars?
Yes, Larry. What for?
Well, I've got some plans.
- Not thinking of getting married are you?  - Why not?
Anything he wants to know he can find out...
...but he has to borrow because he found a girl.
If what you say is true... why don't you find her a million for a wedding present.
- A million?
- Sure
By picking all 5 winners at the racetrack tomorrow.
He's got you there.
- Think fast, Larry.
- You got him there, Bob.
Chick, have you seen Pop Benson?
No sir, he hasn't been around for 2 days.
Don't tell me you're still going to hang around for Pop Benson.
It's funny he doesn't show up.
Well, you know the old man...
He's been here a long time.
He's a priviliged character.
He's got a right to get drunk once in a while.
It's not often.
Well, drunk or sober, he's got to be somewhere.
If I were you I'd turn out that light and go home. Goodnight.
Pop!
Pop, wait!
Pop! I've been hunting high and low for you Pop
I said I never wanted to see that newspaper again. I was wrong.
Oh, I'm all mixed up in something
I don't understand... and I'm not going to ask any questions. All I want is...
...one more paper.
Pop, please for the last time.
I won't ask you again
I won't tell anybody how I got it...
...I've just got to know what's going to happen tomorrow.
It won't do you any good, Larry.
Oh but it will. It will make me rich, then I'll have everything I want.
Is it only money you want in this world?
I've got everything else.
I'm in love...
Give it to me Pop and I'll be happy for the rest of my life
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Yes
Thanks for giving it to me Pop.
Remember, I didn't give it to you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...I wish to inform you... that this is the last performance we give at this theatre.
So, we want to thank you very very much...
...for giving us such kind attention.
Thank you so much.
Larry, go away. Keep out of his sight
- I've got to talk to you
- No, my uncle will see you
- I want to talk to him too
No, he found your clothes in my room.
Darling, will you marry me?
- Don't stay here. He'll shoot you.
- Alright, let him but first...
Please, for my sake stay hidden. Stay back there.
Oh, it's you huh?
I've been wanting to talk to you
I'd like to talk to you too Professor.
That's an idea. Won't you step in to my dressing room?
Thank you.
Thank you!
Sylvia, by the way, won't you introduce me to your friend here
Uncle, this is Mr Larry Stevens. of the "Evening News".
Oh, "Evening News"?
A journalist, eh?
Yes, that's right.
Step right in.
Journalism must be a very interesting profession.
You get around quite a bit I suppose.
- That's right, yes.
Professor, I want to ask about your niece
So do I Mr Stevens.
The strange thing that you find in your pockets.
- About your niece...
- Don't be frightened Mr Stevens.
A blank cartridge
You see, everything is illusion in my profession
Unfortunately, life is not an illusion.
In the end we always face reality.
For instance, this is reality.
Oh uncle, please don't play with that gun.
Oh, I'm not playing with it, my dear.
In the mean time, go over there and open those curtains please?
That's a good girl.
Now take down those clothes.
- See hear, Professor...
- Don't interrupt Mr Stevens.
Which clothes, uncle?
My dear I'm sure you know!
I'm awfully sorry
I didn't return these sooner...
...but I was in a place where I couldn't get out.
- I can explain everything.
- So can I
- Do these clothes fit you?
- Certainly they fit me, they're mine
No, uncle, no.
I love her and I'm gonna to marry her.
- ...disgraced before your married.
What did you say?
- I said I'm going to marry her.
- Listen to him change his tune.
I'm not changing my tune at all.
I said I'm going to marry her.
No you didn't.
I said you're going to marry her.
No-one's asked me what I want?
- Nobody's going to ask you
- He's right, nobody is going to ...
No. No. I'm asking you darling
I love you
Say you'll marry me without any waiting. Tomorrow. Say it.
Larry, do I have to say it?
You don't have nothing to say.
I'm doing all the saying around here.
Go on get outta here
Not you Stevens. You stay right here.
There's something I want to ask you.
Do you have any money?
You think you can support a wife?
I think so, yes
What's your prospects?
Wonderful
Tonight I have a hundred dollars
Tomorrow I'll have a hundred thousand
You expect me to believe that?
Your business is to predict the future, isn't it?
Yeah, what of it?
Have you ever predicted five winners at a race track?
Stop asking me those silly questions
So what are you, a gambler?
No, no. A gambler can lose, I can't.
Rubbish
I'll prove it to you
Can you stand the shock?
I've seen about everything
Well you haven't seen this
I can hardly believe it myself
Cut out this hocus-pocus.
What is it?
Oh, you're busy Cigolini
Come in, come in Mr Beckstein.
- I want to see you alone
- By all means
Stay here.
Race results.
Lightning, Ramona...
...Black Flash.
Wonderful!
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, tomorrow.
- I didn't even know you were engaged
- Neither did I til a few minutes ago
It's so wonderful.
Everythings happening at once...
Larry, darling.
Is everything alright?
Yes, everything.
What's the matter Larry?
Aren't you happy?
Oh sure
Has anything happened?
Not yet
Can't we get married?
Oh darling, let's not wait
If we are going to be married we've got to be married tonight
- I've got to get away
- Get away?
- Out of town. Will you come with me?
- But where?
I don't care. Anywhere!
Sylvia look, I just signed a contract for a world tour
If you weren't getting married, what a chance we'd have to travel
We're going to London,
Paris and Europe
She can go. I'll go with you
Professor. Let's all go.
Can we leave right now, tonight??
- Listen, I'm leaving next week
- That's too late
- And without you, Stevens.
- I know, I know
So, your niece is being married?
Didn't you know. to Mr Larry
Stevensof the  "Evening News".
Congratulations my dear Stevens.
I read your articles. The hold-up, the Union Bank. You're a hero.
- Come along Mr Stevens.
- I gotta stay...
I know you're modest. But I want these good people out front...
... to give you a hand.
You've got to take a bow.
Ladies and Gentlemen. I am proud to present to you, a local hero.
The man with the nose for news.
The man who's there when things happen.
The man who'll brave death if it makes news.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr Larry Stevens of the "Evening News".
Well, he's got no broken bones
He can get married, can't he?
He can get married as soon as he wakes up.
Wakes up? It's noon!
Don't tell me he's still asleep?
When you brought him in last night, he was so restless, that they gave him a hypodermic.
Hypodermic or no hypodermic. Go in there and tell him he's got to wake up
He woke up, Doctor.
And he won't speak.
He looks as if I scared him.
How are you feeling this morning,
Mr Stevens?
Am I in the St. George hotel?
Do I look like a hotel clerk?
This is a hospital.
Where am I shot?
In the arm. I gave you a shot to make you sleep.
Did I sleep two days? I hope.
No, just one night. That's all you needed, a good night's sleep.
And all you need now is fresh air.
Oh, I must have had a nightmare
Fresh air will take away that headache.
Get on your feet. Get outdoors
Anything else you wish, Mr Stevens?
Yes, where are my clothes?
I'll get them for you.
- Nurse...
- Yes?
...do you see anything in my coat pockets?
No, Mr Stevens, nothing at all
Only a newspaper
If there is anything else you wish, you can call me.
Ha! Look at the sick man, quietly reading the newspaper
Tell me how do you feel?
Are you alright?
Well, I'm still alive.
You're a lucky boy.
You know, with a fall like that you might have killed yourself
I guess my time hadn't come...
- What time is it?
- A little past noon.
By the way, you know you're getting married today
I'm afraid I can't.
You what?
I can't leave this room.
Not before tomorrow...
...it would be fatal.
Listen, you scallywag, I've just been talking to your Doctor out there... he says you're as strong as a horse.
He says you'll last a hundred years.
He doesn't know anything about it.
Oh, you're faking huh?
Think you didn't fool the Doctor...
...You had no intentions of marrying her, huh?
- You're trying to get out of it?
- No, I want to marry Sylvia.
Tell her I'm on my way
Listen, I should have shot you last night.
Doctor, Nurse?!
I'm going to get married.
But I'll be back...
Keep this room and don't let me out of here again tonight.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
And may God bless your union.
Congratulations, Mr Stevens.
I'm glad to see you so serious.
Marriage is a serious business.
- It's meant to last a lifetime.
- Thank you, Judge.
I wish you all the happiness and health in the world
And may all your troubles be little ones.
That'll be five dollars, please.
Anything else I can do for you?
Yes, you can draw up my Will.
Sorry, you'll have to go to the races. I can't.
Races? On your honeymoon?
People don't go to the races on their honeymoon
- What about your Will?
- My Will?
I want to leave everything to my widow. I mean, my wife.
Eden Gardens, cabby.
No, take him to the racetrack.
Here are the names of the winners.
I aint going to no racetrack
Don't you want Sylvia to be rich?
It's her last chance.
Larry darling, we can go some other day
Some other day won't do.
Eden Gardens.
Alright, we'll go ourselves.
No we aint gonna go.
We're going to the Eden...
Get in darling this is for you. Right driver, hurry up to the racetrack
I want to get there in time to make a bet in the first race
Not if I can help it. Driver dont pay no attention, take us to Eden Gardens
Sorry Miss, there are no ladies permitted inside the betting ring.
- Good, can you keep him out too?
- Wait here, dear.
Oh, I better go and watch him.
A hundered dollars on Lamplighter.
You wouldn't try to kid me would you, Mister?
Lamplighter to win.
Here's the hundred.
Go on, peddle your papers.
Lamplighter just won by two lengths.
Well, did I know the winner or didn't I?
That's just fool luck. I never knew a gambler yet that didn't go broke
But I'm not a gambler.
I tell you, I cant lose
That's the spirit Mister. How about picking a winner for the second race.
- You want me to tell you?
- Sure.
Mud-Lark.
The odds are 20-1
Do you want to lay that hundred?
Sure, take the wad.
Teach him a lesson.
The sooner he goes broke, the sooner he finds out this is a suckers game.
Look at him.
They ought to send you back to the Bull yard...
What a dog.
He wouldn't even make good cat meat.
Mud-Lark.
Mud-Lark. Mud-Lark.
Mud-Lark! Mud-Lark!
He's there... Mud-Lark!
We won, we won!
It don't mean a thing. The other horses were slower that's all
Two thousand dollars and my congratulations, Sir.
If I had you're luck friend,
I'd ride it.
Thats just what I'm going to do. What will you pay on Lightning in the 3rd?
- Straight place or show?
- To win.
It's not for me it's for Sylvia.
Then I'll take the money and go on home
She's my niece aint she.
I've got a right and a duty to protect her future.
I'll take the winnings, please.
The other gentleman made the bet, my friend.
The odds are 5-1 on Lightning.
What do you say?
You're on. Two thousand.
Spoken like a sport.
Give the gentleman a ticket, Chevy.
I can't stand it, I can't stand it!
I won't see it.
Lightning, Lightning!
- Come on Lightning.
- It can't be. Are you sure?
Look for yourself
Come on Lightning!
You mean, you want to bet all this money on Ramona?
Right, to win.
I'll take Ramona too.
I'm afraid that will have to be an even money bet Misterr.
Give me that money. I'll get 4/1 at any place in this tent
You're a good customer.
How about 3/1
3/1, OK
Wait a minute, he's playing us for suckers
This way we can only win 30,000
- If Ramona wins
- Of course, if Ramona wins...
Don't worry, Ramona will win.
What is to be, will be
Look, Larry. Ramona is out ahead.
I know.
Isn't it wonderful darling?
Everything's turning out just the way you expect.
Everything
Ramona, Ramona, Ramona!
Ramona, Ramona, Ramona!
That's a lot of money to bet on one horse Mister.
I can't give you 2/1 on Black Flash.
I could get you 5/1 on Diablo.
Black Flash.
Don't be so pig-headed.
What do you know about horses?
Black Flash.
There you are.
30,000 to win on Black Flash.
For the love of Mike.
Would you put half of it on Diablo?
Black Flash.
I've been in this business a long time but I've never heard of anyone
...picking four sure things in a row.
Not unless he's got things fixed.
I think I'll do a little fixing myself
Diablo is going to win this time if he never runs another race
Black Flash. Black Flash!
Come on, Black Flash!
Black Flash, Black Flash!
Diablo, Diablo!
Diablo, Diablo!
Diablo, Diablo!
Diablo, Diablo!
Get away from me. Get away from me.
You and your tips.
They were wrong. They were wrong!
Black Flash lost.
If I had my gun I'd shoot you.
But I'm not going to get shot.
If the back page was wrong, the front page can be wrong
Sylvia, what a mess you've made out of your life. Look what you married!
Oh, we're happy uncle.
We're always going to be happy.
Does anything else matter?
The judges have the following official announcement to make:
...in the race which has just been run...
...number 7...
...Diablo, has been disqualified.
The winner in the fifth race...
...is Black Flash.
There you are.
Pay me Mister, 60,000 samolians.
And dont give me them in small bills.
I hope you know this is going to clean me out.
Haha, but are you in a suckers game!
Three, four, five...
...Forty-nine, Fifty...
...Fifty-one...
- Driver, stop.
- What's the matter?
- I'm not going back to town.
- But where else can we go?
Anywhere, I...
Well, we could have a nice dinner here in the country someplace?
Larry, will you do something for me?
Something nice?
Lets be gay.
I'd like to have dinner someplace where there's music and people.
I know. The St. George hotel.
No, No. Not tonight darling
Alright Larry. We'll go tomorrow night.
Some other time.
Here you are my dear.
This makes you a rich woman.
Oh no. I'd be afraid to carry that much money
You better keep it; it'll be safer.
No, I might lose it.
- What about me? Please take it
- Somebody's got to take it
Stop, thief!
After him!
After him!
Stop, thief!
After him!
Stop, thief!
Faster driver, he's got $60,000 of my money.
- He's got a gun too.
- A gun?
- Who cares?
- Sure, who cares.
- I care and I'm the driver.
- Faster, Faster!
Get him out of here.
You're wasting my time with your shenanigans
Shenanigans my foot! I tell you we chased the guys all the way into town
Then he arrests us for speeding.
Why didn't you chase the guy who was stealing our money It was over $60000
Go on, who do you think I am?
Ah, it's a fine poilce force!
You let the thief escape and you arrest the victim
Go on, beat it, beat it. Skidoo!
Wait a minute. You can't throw me out of jail. I'm arrested.
Lock me up and don't let me out of here before tomorrow.
Get out of here, both of you.
I'm sick of you.
Inspector, lock me up for just half an hour?
What for?
Well I'm arrested. Put me in jail.
Jail?
Where you belong is the bughouse!
Get 'em outta here!
Inspector, do me a favour will you?
Just lock me up here for 35 minutes ...
- you don't know what it means to me.
- Get out of here!
And stay out!
I wonder why he didn't want us to go in there with him?
Maybe he had some personal business to attend to, uncle.
Yes, the fella must be in there that gives him all the winners.
I hope he finds him.
- Larry, hello Larry.
- Where have you been all day?
Yeah, the boss is tearing his hair
Looking all over town for his number 1 reporter.
Listen, have any of you fellows seen Pop Benson?
Whats the matter?
Where is he?
You mean you haven't heard?
Heard what?
- Why, the old man is dead.
- Dead?
I'm writing his obit.
What caused it?
Just old age, I guess.
- When did you last see him?
- We all saw him Larry. You were here
- When?
- Three nights ago
He died just after we left him.
You remember?
We were all kidding in the library...
Remember when we all laughed when he said...
..."How do you know you've got ten years to live?"
Poor old fella.
Good thing he didn't know he only had time to get home himself.
Oh, don't take it so hard Larry.
When they found the old man they said he had a smile on his face.
Sure, he was always happy.
Remember how he always tried to play jokes on people?
Yes.
Stevens. Come in here.
Look at that clock.
Ten past six.
How long do you expect to hold down your job?
Noty very long, Mr Gordon.
Right, but I'm going to give you another chance.

I got a tip something big is going to break. I'll give you the address
No nevermind. I know where it is.
Where?

That's not it.
It's the other side of town.
You mean, you're not sending me to the St. George hotel?
Can't you read?
Mr Gordon, aren't you making a mistake?
Am I in the habit of making mistakes, young man?
Now, you get in a cab and get over there right away
Alright.
But I'm afraid I'm going to wind up at the
St. George hotel at 6:25... no matter where I go
St. George hotel.
I dunno, maybe there is something wrong somewhere.
It's in a different direction
It's in the opposite direction.
Stevens...

- Go to the St. George hotel.
- What for?
You know what for, my boy.

It's alright, I can live without it.
What I'd like to know is, what happened to that money?.
Oh, who cares?
It didn't seem real anyway.
That's right. Came in like a dream and went out like a dream.
That racetrack aint no dream, though?
Listen man, it's a cinch to clean up millions. All you gotta do is pick em
That's all.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight kids.
Are you interested in horse racing?
- I only play sure things..
- You must have a good system.
You said it friend.
Just come around tomorrow and I'll show you how it's done.
It's very simple.
All you do is take the money that you win on the first race...
...and you bet it on the winner of the second race...
...then you take the money that you win on the second race....
...and you bet it on the winner of the third race...
And then -- you dont lose your nerve, see -- you take the whole bundle...
...and you put on the winner in the fourth race...
Cab!
Cab!
- Larry darling, we can't take a cab.
- Why not?
We haven't any money.
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait here until the rain stops.
Poor darling. What a wedding night!
No money, no cab, no umbrella, no shelter, no nothing!
Nothing but a wonderful future.
Don't tell me you can read the future
Let's always take life as it comes.
Larry darling, I only pretended to read the future.
We had to in our act.
But when I'm close to you I ...
...I really feel I can look way ahead.
Years and years.
What do you see? Are we happy?
We'll always be happy as long as we're together.
- Just the two of us
- Just the two of us?
Oh no, I want at least four sons.
Fine, fine.
And I want five daughters.
- It will have to be a big house.
- Bigger than that!
I wonder how we can afford it?
You'll be the owner of the "Evening News".
Well then we can have a whole house full of children.
Big enough for grandchildren too.
And great grandchildren someday.
I can almost see them.
Fifty years from tonight...
...that will be our
Golden anniversary.
- Look darling.
- What?
We can go.
Thanks Pop.
It's good for something anyway.
 ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER 
 [This story is about Eddie Kagle who based his way of living on what Omar Khayyam once said: 
 "Live fully while you may and reckon not the cost."]
Okay, Eddie, you're on your own.
Oh, come on, son. After four years, can't you favor us a smile on your graduation day?
Hi, Eddie!
Hi, Smiley.
What's the matter, Boss? Couldn't you tear yourself away?
How was the stretch this time, Boss? Tough?
No.
Which is why I didn't crash out like always.
I was sure expecting you to.
Nice car.
It's all yours.
Ours.
Everything we've got.
You're a swell pal, Eddie.
Yeah, I've heard all about it.
You've done a good job while I was gone, and I ain't forgetting it.
I did big, Eddie.
You're a lot richer than when you went in.
We're a lot richer.
Thanks, Eddie.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. We got a couple of new spots downtown.
Real classy.
I got the guy waiting to show you the books.
I'll take your word for it like always.
'Cause we got troubles, too.
I'll take care of the troubles.
Like when we were kids.
Me and you against everybody, Smiley?
Sure.
Got my rod?
Wearing it right next to my heart.
Let me have it.
Sure.
I just can't understand it.
I'm walking down the street minding my own business.
I step off the curb. Car comes tearing around the corner against the red light.
The cop should have picked up the driver of that car, not me.
Say, are you a trustee?
Yes.
How long have you been in this stir?
Three hundred odd years.
Gosh, it's hot here.
Gets like this in Florida sometimes.
Florida?
Florida never smelled like this.
Like rotten eggs.
Precisely, young man, rotten eggs.
The unpleasant odor is caused by H2SO4, hydrogen sulfuric acid.
The most common compound of hydrogen and sulfur.
Am I right?
I poisoned my wife with a sulfur compound.
My young wife, she was unfaithful.
I was a chemist.
What do you mean was?
Before they hanged me.
Where are the rope marks?
Young man, what is the last thing you remember before they brought you here?
Smiley.
Smiley.
That slimy double-crossing rat bludgeon me with my own rod.
Where are the bullet holes?
Where?
How do you like that?
He missed.
Sitting right next to me, and he missed.
He didn't miss.
You're dead.
Huh?
We're all dead.
Listen to this marv, will you?
It's true.
Only the soul exists down here.
Jeez.
I always said I'd wind up down here.
Look, I don't care where I am.
I got to get Smiley.
There must be some way across this camp!
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.
Lay off!
Lay off of me, will you?
I got to get out of here.
I'm getting Smiley!
Lay off me, I tell you!
I got to get Smiley!
What sort of temperature is that?
It's the labor shortage, Sire.
Especially the boiler room personnel.
There's been a fearful drop.
We're operating at .73% of normal.
You want me to catch my death a cold?
No, Sire.
We're short of condemned souls.
I objectively suggest—
Warden, I have no need of your infantile suggestions.
I'll attend to this matter myself.
My opponent is always with some favored mortal of his testing my prowess.
This time it happens to be one Judge Frederick Parker of the New World.
Oh, we'll see who goes down in defeat.
My beloved Sire, your powers are wondrous to behold.
But I have lately been beset by great problems.
My adversary is working overtime.
That superior though he may be and though he's set up a thousand Judge Parkers to thwart me, he must recognize that I am still Master of my own sphere.
I did it, Sire.
What in my domain is that?
You have no right to...
Help!
Let go of me, you dirty coppers!
I'll get every one of you!
Quiet!
You can't hold me here!
You can't keep me
What's the meaning of this? How dare you bring him here!
We had no choice, Warden.
Cast him down into the boiler room in the 55th circle of darkness.
I apologize for the intrusion, Sire.
Not at all, Warden.
Pour me a drink.
You're not angry?
Angry? On the contrary, I'm very pleased.
In fact, I'm delighted.
To— What was his name?
You mean, the doomed soul that was here? Kagle, Eddie Kagle?
Eddie Kagle.
You drink to him?
A cheap gangster?
Why not?
I love him.
Ever see that face before?
Of course.
It was just here in this room, Eddie Kagle.
Wrong, Warden.
That happens to be a picture of Judge Frederick Parker.
Impossible.
- They look exactly— 
- Precisely.
They look exactly alike.
And this likeness is just the weapon I need to defeat Mr. Parker.
Eddie Kagle.
How hot do they want it down here?
Never gets hot enough to suit the boss.
You think this is bad? Wait until they stick you in one of them hot clay pits way down below.
You mean, we ain't at bottom now?
There ain't no bottom in this joint.
Back to work! Back!
Back to your work!
I ain't taking this no longer.
I'm crashing out of this college.
Nobody crashes out of here.
Nobody but Eddie Kagle.
He breaks out from every place.
I'll crash out with you, Eddie.
Who are you?
A pal.
I don't like pals.
You like Smiley?
How do you know about Smiley?
Grapevine.
I can help you get him.
I got somebody I want to get, too.
We can help each other.
Is it a deal?
We got to crash first.
I know how.
Next, screws.
Well, Eddie?
Okay.
Watch your step. One false mood and I slug you.
I'll be extremely careful.
Rub that smile off your mouth.
A guy smiled once when he plucked me.
Certainly.
Come on. Now.
Hey, you don't stern out for something.
- That's the furnace.
- It's the only way.
Come on.
How long have you been down here?
Since time immemorial.
The way you talk, you must have had a good education.
The most liberal one.
I only went to third grade.
I went through the whole gamut of learning. I know everything.
Stuck on yourself, huh?
What's your name?
Well, I have a number of aliases. I have a long record under the name of Mephistopheles.
Greek, huh?
Well, there are some who claim I'm more of one nation than another, but that's not true, Eddie. I am of all nations. I claim no favorites.
You look like a con man. Look, Mephistopheles—
Call me Nick.
You married?
Millions of women have adored me.
Quite a guy with the ladies, huh?
I'm a fascinating fellow.
Look, I ain't playing around with dangerous dynamite.
But delightful dynamite, Eddie.
Live fully while you may, and reckon not the cost.
Deny yourself nothing. Fame and blaze like a torch, and toss the part about you.
I'll make the most of what we yet may spin... before we, too, into the dust, descend.
Your talkin' screwed.
Is it alright if I laugh occasionally?
There ain't nothing to laugh about.
I never saw nothing to laugh about my whole life.
There was a time I left school and ran away from home when I caught my folks was always drunken.
What I've been doing is try to be somebody, and I did pretty good.
Worked myself up from where I had nothing to eat and no place to sleep to top guy in my business.
Splendid. You're a man after my own heart.
I wish the world was filled with Eddie's.
How long is it going to take us to get up there?
Any moment now.
Alright, down there, send it up.
Old man Schmalhausen must be baking with rotten eggs.
Smells like the Devil, too, doesn't it?
Wow, them ashes are still hot.
Hey, Janitor. Dash them ashes with water before you send them up.
Hey, I don't feel nothing.
Of course not. You haven't got a body.
I ain't got no body? How am I supposed to get Smiley?
Hey, you muggler, look at what you're doing!
No one can see you or hear you until I find you a body.
Now, come on, Eddie.
How are you gonna find it?
Well, everyone has his physical counterpart, his double.
I happen to know where your double is.
You mean a guy which looks like me?
A spitting image.
But suppose he doen't want to give me his body.
He'll be asleep.
He won't have anything to say about it.
What happens when he wakes up?
When he wakes up, he'll be you.
And who will I be?
You'll be him.
Huh?
To everyone else, you'll be him. Our course, to yourself, you'll be yourself.
Oh.
Hey, give me that again, will you?
Ah, stop worrying about it, Eddie. Leave everything to me.
I'm leaving nothing to you, con man.
I'm sorry, Eddie. It's this cold air. It makes me irritable.
I don't like cold climates.
I don't feel nothing.
And if you ain't got no body neither, how come you feel cold?
I've been down below so long that even my soul has gotten accustomed to the heat.
Hey, if I ain't got no body, I ain't got no fingers, right?
Right?
No fingers, no fingerprints, right?
Right.
I can get away with murder.
Not exactly.
Without fingers, you cannot squeeze a trigger.
Yeah.
I'd sure wanna squeeze a trigger.
Hey!
What is this, a double cross?
This ain't St. Louie.
Smiley is in St. Louie.
The body we want is here, and don't you forget, you have a little job to do for me first.
That was our deal.
Okay.
I ain't reneging.
Come on.
 Criminal Court Building 
Hey!
What's the idea of bringing me here?
I've got to get you the fingers to squeeze that trigger.
How do you figure you're getting into the criminal court?
How did I figure getting you out of that jam down below?
But I did.
Yeah.
That was neat.
This will be even neater.
Trust me.
Okay.
Let's go.
There ain't a seat in the joint.
Let's sit here.
What's the matter with you? There's cops in them seats.
Son, they won't mind. They won't even know.
Your Honor, the defendant of this case has failed to establish an alibi.
The testimony conclusively proves that this man was at the scene of the crime and at the exact time it was committed.
Therefore, I respectfully request the court—
That's a lie! I'm not going to take any more of this!
Get him down, quick.
What happened?
He collapsed, Eddie.
Not a judge ever passed out on me.
This court is now adjuourned.
Come on, Eddie. Let's go.
Hey, don't give me no orders.
I do all the leading.
Get me?
Yes, Eddie.
Don't you never forget.
I'm the boss.
Yes, Eddie.
I shouldn't have been so brusque.
I've given him a sedative. Let him sleep a while. Then get him home.
He'll be alright.
Sure, Doctor.
Alright, gentlemen.
He smokes.
I told you I knew where your double was.
If this guy had hung around St. Louis, he'd have gotten bumped instead of me.
Too bad he didn't.
Is he the guy you wanna get?
Yeah.
What'd he do to you? Send you up?
I was sent down, not up.
Hey, this guy's a judge.
I ain't muscling in on no judge's body.
What difference does it make?
It will serve your purpose and mine.
Yeah.
What happens when he gets up and finds I'm him?
When we're through with him, he won't know a thing.
Not a single blip solitary thing.
What about you?
Ain't you gonna find yourself a body?
Yeah, I'll get one.
But you first, you're the important one.
Yeah, and don't you forget it.
I won't forget it, Eddie.
Hurry up.
Whatcha doing?
Fusion, Eddie.
The power of heat.
I'll fuse you into this man as steel can be fused into steel.
Relax.
Relax.
Oh, Albert.
Yes, Doctor?
Ms. Foster still here?
Yes, Sir, she's making coffee.
Oh my, may I inquire how the judge is, Sir?
Oh, a goodnight's rest and he'll be alright.
Oh, that's good.
Run down to the druggist will you and get this sedative just in case he wakes up.
Yes, Doctor, it'll be ready for him.
Is he still sleeping?
Yes.
There you are.
Well, thanks.
Nothing serious, I hope, Matt.
Excellent.
No, I don't think so.
However, I've been expecting this for some time.
Why do you say that?
One can only do so much especially one of Fred's temperament.
When he awakes in the morning, I suggest find him into his car, and get him away for a couple weeks.
I'm only the judge's secretary, not his wife.
That ring means everything he will be.
I can't possibly go away now.
Why?
Well, with the election only a few days off he's speaking in the auditorium tomorrow.
Now, Barbara. You've always had your own way,
I suppose you will now.
That's not fair, man.
Nobody can stop, Fred. Nobody can push him off!
I'm the last one who wants to see him hurt or sick.
You believe that, don't you?
Of course.
I'll bring him to your office first thing in the morning.
No, no.
That wouldn't do at all.
Not all people are ready to accept psychiatry as a normal branch of medicine.
The general expression left by a man and his psychiatrist must be crazy.
Ridiculous, of course, but there you are.
Some people are rather reluctant, decast of both debilities.
I hadn't noticed.
You're better if I came in.
Goodbye, Barbara.
Goodbye, Matt.
Uh, Albert?
Yes, Miss Ratliffe?
I'm going home, and if the judge awakens during the night, please call me.
Yes, Miss Ratliffe.
Judge.
Police say your appoinment is for nine sharp.
Judge!
Your Honor!
I hated to wake you, Sir. You were sleeping so peacefully.
He did it.
I got them.
But what, Sir?
You got one, too.
I hope so, Sir.
I can feel myself.
I'm solid.
Solid, like I used to be.
Are you quite alright, Sir?
Alright? Sure, I'm alright.
N-
Nick—Where's Nick?
Hey, hey. Hey! Where are you?
Hey, Nick!
Did Nick sleep here, too?
I'm afraid I don't follow you, Sir.
You better not.
I don't like being followed.
Who are you, anyway?
Uh, really, Sir?
Then tell me or do I slap it out of you.
And if you'd pardon me, your bath is ready, Sir.
I don't need no bath.
They cleaned me up good when they let me out.
Where's his duds?
I beg your pardon?
His duds, his rags, clothes?
Whose clothes, Sir?
The judge's! I've got to get dressed and get to St. Louis quick.
What am I, a judge or an undertaker?
And you got nothin' with fancy stripes?
Fancy stripes?
Oh, never mind. I'll wear one of these.
Alright, you double crosser.
I'm comin' for ya.
Here you are, Sir.
What are you gonna do?
Help you into them, Sir.
Scram.
- But Sir, I-I— 
- Scram!
Yes, Sir.
Hello, Ms. Barbara?
This is Albert.
I-I don't wish to alarm you, but the judge is definitely not himself this morning.
I'm terribly worried for him.
Oh, that'll be splendid.
And do hurry, please.
Thank you.
Hey, you!
You.
Yes, sir.
Get me a ticket on the next plane to St. Louis.
But, sir, you—
You work here, don't you?
Well really.
- For a good many years.
- Well, get it.
But your appointment, Sir!
I got an appointment at St. Louis, which comes first.
Plane reservations are hard to get, especially on such short notice.
Okay, call the airport and get me a special plane, all for myself.
Come on.
Hey.
If I need some dough, is there any around?
It's the usual place, Sir.
Don't give me no double talk. Where's the dough?
In the safe, Sir.
I don't see no safe.
If I seem to be baffled—
Will you shut up and do what I tell you?
Where's the strong box.
Behind the picture, Sir.
There's a flock of pictures.
The one with the boat, Sir.
The button, Sir.
Got any sandpaper?
Have you forgotten the combination?
I don't need no combination. This is duck soup.
Oh please, Sir.
Hey, where's the nearest hard shop?
You can't possibly leave town today, Sir.
 LOAN OFFICE 
Hello, Eddie.
How'd you get here?
I never explain my actions.
Then explain to me, I don't like no surprises.
I have many more surprises in store for you if you try to run out on me again.
I ain't running out on nothin'.
I'm just hoppin' over to St. Louis to take care of that rat.
That rat can wait. Parker comes first.
Ah, being up so high makes me uncomfortable.
I'm much happier down below.
Yeah, huh?
I appall altitudes.
Hey, what's that?
Engine trouble, Sir. We'll have to go back to the fields.
What a strange coincidence.
Wipe that smile off your mug.
I apologize, most completely.
Are you sure he said St. Louis?
Yes, Ms. Barbara.
St. Louis.
St. Louis!
I can't imagine what could take him there!
At a time like this, with a thousand things to do!
You should've done something, Albert.
Phone me, or-or stopped him, or something!
I tried to, Ms. Barbara.
But he gave me a push, and out he went!
Well, that's ridiculous!
The judge is gentility itself. He never pushed anybody.
He never did any of the things he did this morning.
From the first time he awakened, he-he acted peculiarly.
Go on.
When I went to help him dress, he uh, he told me to scram!
The judge said scram?
That was the very word he used, Ms. Barbara.
Are you certain you weren't having hallucinations, Albert?
I only wish that were true, it's been most disturbing.
I would've called Dr. Higgins, but I didn't have the opportunity.
Well, I'll call him now.
Very good, Ms. Barbara.
Hello, Doctor Higgins, please.
This is Barbara Foster.
Not a word to anybody, Albert.
Oh, heavens no, Ms—
Hello, Matt.
Look I'm at Fred's.
No, he isn't here!
He took a plane for St. Louis.
That's extraordinary.
Well.
Don't be unduly alarmed it may be only a passing aberration.
We'll see when he gets back.
Let me know the moment he arrives.
And let me warn you, Barbara.
No matter how strange he acts, don't antagonize him.
Humor him, indulge him.
Now we are dealing with someone who's ill, perhaps very ill.
Now you understand, don't you, Barbara?
The important thing is patience.
I understand, Matt, goodbye.
Well, Albert.
We must be very patient with him.
We will, Ms. Barbara.
Remember now, not a word to a soul.
Your Honor, did you uh, miss your plane?
Yeah.
Albert, who is it?
The judge is back.
Darling!
Darling, I was so worried about you.
Who's the dame?
Your fiancée.
The girlfriend.
Or rather, the judge's.
Come on Eddie, make the most of it. She's all yours.
Hey, this is okay.
It ain't only a trigger I can squeeze.
My Darling, you've never talked like that before.
Why are you staring at me?
Just sizing you up.
Not bad.
Plenty of curves, and all in the right places.
Come here, Babe.
Please, Darling.
You don't have to be afraid of me.
How about me and you stepping out tonight in a long time?
Please, Fred.
Fred?
You're Fred.
Oh that's the judge's handle.
Who are you talking to, Dear?
Nick.
Oh.
Nick.
Beat it.
Scram!
Yes, Sir.
Fred, you never talk to Albert—
No matter what I never, there's gonna be lots of things you ain't never seen the judge do.
Better get used to it.
Yes Dear, I-I'll try.
Oh please, Fred. You're hurting me!
Hey! Playing hard to get, eh?
What's so funny?
Sorry, Eddie. Sorry.
So, what's your name?
Oh really, Fred?
What's your name?
Now you certainly know my name.
I wouldn't ask if I know.
I'll call you a Rosie.
Rosie!?
Yeah, a little number I used to run around with.
Built just like you.
Come on, come on. Relax.
I ain't such a bad guy.
Now stop it, Fred!
Hey who you yellin' at?
I'm sorry, Dear.
Okay.
You'll be late.
I got lots of time.
Of course, but you're doing the auditorium to deliver your speech.
Come again?
Your speech, Dear. it's getting late.
I do all my speech with my rode.
I want you to make this speech, Eddie.
I'll be behind you, whispering in your ear.
It's all part of the plan.
Hey, I think you're doing a little too much planning.
On second thought, Dear, maybe it'd be best if we postponed it.
What do you mean best? If I gotta make a speech, I'll make it.
It'll smell, but it's okay.
Perhaps you better take a few days rest.
I'll call the campaign committee and explain.
What's the matter, what's the matter?
You think I can't do it?
I know you can, only—
Only nothin'.
I can do anything I put my mind on.
Of course!
Where do we go?
The auditorium.
Come on, we'll give it to 'em good.
C'mon, Nick.
Just who is Nick?
Just a con man I'm tied in with.
Boy, we ain't been forgotten by lady luck like I thought.
Judge Parker collapsed on bed.
Now ain't that just too bad?
And listen to this editorial.
"Dare we leave the helm of our ship in the hands of a man whose physical condition is in question?
Now in the stormiest period in our state's history?"
Certainly not.
And as patriotic citizens, we gotta do something about this situation.
Yeah.
Now, back in St. Louis—
Never mind St. Louis, Shaggsy.
Whatever you did in your hometown, we'd do it better here.
The point is, we've got to see that the judge stays sick.
We gotta see that this condition maybe even gets worse.
Sure, Boss. That's the idea.
Now, we've the judge hanging on the ropes. Now we gotta deliver KO.
Yeah.
All of which is only to protect the people, mind you.
Now, with our boy, people can go about their business in the pursuit of happiness, which is coming, without worry.
Sure. Without worrying.
That's right.
Now, we're speaking at the auditorium at two.
That'll give you plenty of time.
Put on a good show, Shaggsy.
One more cave in like he had in court yesterday and...
And we'll be dusting off the governor's chair for our boy.
Come on, boys.
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Hello, Sweetheart.
My wife, go ahead.
And remember, I want to hear that the judge has taken a turn for the worst.
We'll bring back his teeth.
Come on.
 A Vote for Parker is a Vote for Yourself 
 Sponsored by the Citizen's Better Government Committee 
Hey, imagine me running for governor.
Oh Darling, you're too modest.
Come on, let's go on the stage.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. I want to case the joint first.
Hey. Look at that turnout.
Hey, what are you going backwards for?
Stick close.
You're giving me the words, remember?
Oh there is his honor now, excuse me.
Hey, where are you?
Please, Darling.
Well, Your Honor, we're all ready to start.
Where is Nick?
They're waiting.
Let 'em wait.
Hey, where did he go?
There's someone with his honor?
I'm sure we can find him a seat.
Oh, that'll be fine.
Darling. Darling.
Please, Darling, everyone's waiting.
I need Nick to help me with the words.
You have your speech right here.
Have a seat, Judge. I was getting a little worried about you.
Children, you're all ready.
Now it's time, go ahead.
Your Honor?
Stand up, Dear.
Your honor on behalf of all the boys and girls and members of the club... and in gratitude for all you have done for them, regardless of who they are...
Regardless of who they are...
And where they come from.
And where they come from, we want to present you with...
I lost it.
Look in this pocket.
There it is!
Jeez.
This watch.
Thank the children.
Thanks kids.
You're welcome, Your Honor.
Alright, children. Moving this way.
Fellow Americans, as the campaign for governor of this great state goes into its final phase, it is an honor and a privilege to speak once again in behalf of the candidate of the Citizens of Better Government Committee,
Judge Frederick Parker.
Judge Parker, Youth Movement.
The whole country knows of the famous Parker Youth Foundation created by our candidate 10 years ago.
This one organization has reduced juvenile crime
97% since it was found.
Because Judge Parker is a man who understands that juvenile delinquency is not a matter of bad boys and good boys but rather a matter of bad conditions and good conditions, he is a man revered and loved by his friends, respected and feared by his enemies— a man of countless virtues.
Ladies and Gentlemen, as we have just seen, one of Judge Parker's numerous virtues is his modesty.
What's the idea, letting me down?
I'm not letting you down. Far from it.
What about this?
Throw it away.
Go out there and tell 'em off.
Tell 'em off. What do I say?
Sorry, I don't have to tell you that.
These people sent you to prison, Eddie.
They're your enemies.
They've always hated you.
Now is your chance to tell them what you think of them.
You're not afraid...
-I ain't afraid of nothin'.
Then go out there and give it to them.
Call them by their right names— call them every name you can think of.
- Yeah.
It is my privilege to introduce the next Governor of this great state,
Judge Frederick Parker.
I'll tell them.
Listen! All of you!
I will tell ya a few things.
You're--
Hey you!
He's using Jiu Jitsu.
Stop it, Eddie, stop it. They're your friends.
They are crazy.
See that?
Take it, Eddie. Take it.
It's not you they're after. It's the judge.
Yeah, but I'm getting the punches.
But you're making a hero of the judge.
You wanna make mince meat of me?
Idiot.
Beat it, beat it!
On your feet, get out of here, get going.
No I won't need that now Mr. Kramer thank you.
Are you hurt very much, Your Honor?
Nah.
Sure you're alright, Dear?
You able to walk?
Sure! Sure.
Gee, judge, your honor. You're a champ.
May I kiss you?
The judge don't want girls to kiss him.
You go right ahead Dear, if you want to.
Come on, Babe.
Hey, where's Nick?
Oh never mind, Nick now, Dear. Please.
Well he was with—
Albert, get me some antiseptics and bandages quickly.
Yes, Ms. Barbara.
Darling, you were magnificent.
But you know you weren't cut out for that sort of thing.
You know somebody who could've done it better?
No, Dear.
But I'm afraid of the aftereffects. I know you're going to be ill.
Hey, I've ain't never been sick in my life.
Fred, you were just—
I'm glad Nick ain't here.
Darling, what's come over you?
What's this? Hey!
Take that junk out of here.
And get me a drink.
The mineral water, Sir?
I said a drink— bourbon.
Fred, you don't drink.
You just watch me.
And some cigars.
But Fred, you can't smoke or drink. You know that.
Are you kidding?
What are you standing there for?
Get.
Darling, please. You'll only make yourself ill.
Stop worrying, Rosie.
Hey, how about some smooching.
Darling, you have changed.
Want a shot?
I wish you wouldn't, Dear. You've had enough excitement for one day.
I ain't started, yet.
Take a powder.
Take a powder, Sir?
Oh, you mean scram.
Here's luck, Rosie.
Be careful, Dear.
I can do this all day.
That's funny, I've never choked on this before.
What kind of a body did that lug slip me into?
I better have Albert put you to bed.
I ain't sleepy.
You feel good.
I've got to get home, Dear.
Home?
Don't you live here?
You know perfectly well I don't live here.
The judge must be screwy or something.
You ain't going home, Rosie.
I am going home, and the sooner the better.
Wait a minute, wait, hey--
Darling!
Oh, Fred, I told you.
I'm alright, I'm alright.
You don't have to worry about me.
I've nothing in my way.
I feel fine.
Ms. Barbara! What happened?
His Honor just passed out.
Taxi?
Yes, Ma'am.
Hey, what's the idea?
Get back in your cab or I'll slug you.
Ah, don't get excited.
Come on.
No, Eddie. Let's take this one.
Criminal court, please.
Yes, Ma'am.
I have the the sworn affidavits and depositions for those witnesses in Chicago.
They came in the mail this morning.
What witnesses? What's all this about?
Chicago should be pretty familiar to you. I understand your prison pal has opened a couple of night spots there.
You mean Smiley?
Who's Smiley dear? I don't see his name in these documents.
When I'm finished with him, the only place you'll find his name will be on a tombstone.
Well what is he to do with the Bentley trial?
I don't know no Bentley. All I know--
It's Bentley trial, dear.
The case you're hearing in court today.
Don't worry, Eddie. I'll be there.
This gives you another go at Parker.
You be sure you don't bungle it this time.
Sure, sure. I know all about trials.
So do you Bob.
Are you talking to the cab driver, dear?
Keep your eye front. You want us to get killed?
Sorry, your honor.
Dear, listen to me.
I was talking to Doctor Higgins.
He said--
-Listen, Rosie. I'm handling it my way.
First comes Bentley, then comes that St. Louis, two faced, double crossing, back stabbing--
-Fred!
I'll show you a few tricks on how to get you smarter. Tricks you'd never even dreamed of.
Sure sure I go through with the trial in nothing flat.
And then we shoot out to St. Louis.
What will we do in St. Louis dear?
Not you, just us.
Not..not me?
Just us?
Oh, Darling. You frighten me when you talk like this.
It is strictly between me and Smiley.
We're going south together.
On..on a vacation?
To Florida?
Further south.
It's a hundred times hotter.
Boss I tell you them's his honest own words
And get this.
He said he was going to rush through with the trial and hop to St. Louis to get Smiley!
That dangerous talk for a judge and govenatorial candidate to make.
You sure you heard right?
You positive?
Ya, he called him a double crossing back stabber who's running a racket with the judge's dough.
Nice work, Jim.
Boys, we're in.
The honorable judge just put himself right out of the running.
Shaggsy, that hunch of yours was right.
This judge not only looks like Eddie, he's the biggest two-timing, double crossing candidate that ever ran for office.
He's even worse than our own man.
You calling the judge?
I'm calling Smiley.
This looks like what they put on a guy when giving a neck tie party.
Now tell me the wrap on these Bentleys.
Attempted murder.
Mrs. Bentley and her husband tried to kill her father and collect his insurance.
They pushed him in front of a subway train.
But they bungled it, the fools.
Your man's alive, but somewhat mangled. The entire country is shocked by the ugliness of it.
Somehow they fail to see any beauty in it.
What chance they got?
Judge Parker?
-None.
Or they wouldn't have spent all that money trying to square things before coming up to trial.
Did they try to get to judge Parker?
No, no, no, no.
They wouldn't do that.
They know it's impossible to fix judge Parker.
But Eddie Kagle, now...
And spreading the dough?
The man known as Big Harry.
Oh, what's his last name?
I can't look up no Big Harry.
I want to call 'em up and have 'em come here quick before the trial.
Now, he's too smart for that.
Then what'll I do?
Well you just dial Spring 74242.
I'll guide you. It'll telepathic transmission.
Always showin off with them big words.
I used to dish out plenty of dough myself when I put in a fix.
Now is my chance to get some of it back.
Twenty five grand ain't enough to fix a rap like what this is.
-Why it's it's. - Hanous?
It's Hanous.
The whole country is aroused by it.
Yea it's aroused the whole country.
But your honor...
As is the case of the People vs Mitchel 186 New York 942.
Like in the case of the People vs Mitchel 186 New York 942.
They got 30 years.
You don't want the Bentley's to do a thirty year hitch do you?
No, your honor. But...
If you'll only be reasonable? Let me bring the Bentleys in.
So you're gonna have witnesses for the fix, huh?
No, your honor. I just..just wanted you to see them and have them say a word of their own--
-Wait.
Put them all on the desk first.
Your honor, this is Mr. and Mrs. Bentley.
They will tell you that this whole affair was merely the result of a tragic misunderstanding.
This fine upstanding citizen and the frail, innocent, law-abiding little lady, who were simply victims of circumstance...
As a result of which Mrs. Bentley has been under the constant care of her physician.
She's lost weight. She's been unable to--
Rosie.
Rosie Morgan.
Can't be.
You was bumped.
You was bumped!
You didn't wait long to get hooked up with this lard, did you?
Your honor--
-Shut up.
Easy, Eddie. Don't ruin everything.
You shut up too.
All them trips to Kansas City to see your poor old crippled mother.
And you!
Your honor, get hold of yourself.
So this was your mother, huh?
You little two-timers. Playing about with him all the time.
But I got ya now.
Wait til the trial starts.
I'll throw the book at you. I'll give you the works. I'll put you and him away for keeps.
Your honor, the court is ready sir.
Here's your dough. You can't fix this rat not for a million.
Not for all the dough in the country.
Your honor, they're trying to bribe you?
Imagine!
Wait til I tell the story to press, your honor.
After this you're a sinch to sit in the governor's chair.
Hey.
Don't you never say chair to me.
Oh, I'm sorry your honor.
You fool.
You are mitigated bismal fool.
If you had a body, I'd tear it apart.
Good thing you can do that trick.
You should see him. He's gotten worse.
He's somebody I don't know anymore.
What is it Matt? What's happened to Fred?
It isn't as simple as diagnosing a case of measles.
No thank you.
Could be throwback to his formative years.
His young years, his boyhood years when he lived in the slums.
But what caused it?
Fear probably.
Of what?
Well, he might be afraid of the high office he's running for.
Fear to being elected.
Fear of the responsibilities it might mean.
Fear of loving a woman like you.
A woman like me?
Yes.
Barbara.
I think Fred's withdrawn from the campaign.
Are you serious?
Deadly serious.
But you can't be. He's as good as elected right now.
Yes, I know.
He'll be alright.
He's got to be.
He's got to be governor.
From judge's secretary to governor's wife. Not bad.
Why, Matt!
Barbara.
We've been friends for a long time.
You're the loveliest girl I've ever known.
You're also the most ambitious.
Yes, Matt.
I am.
See, I'm not a psychiatrist.
I don't know much about neurotic conditions.
But I do know that what Fred is doing, he must do.
Psychiatry won't give a lot of poor kids a chance to grow up like decent human beings.
Fred Parker will.
Psychiatry won't wipe out the viscious elements in this world.
But the influence of Governor Parker will.
And this ambitious wench, Barbara Foster, is going to help him do it.
I'm sorry, Barbara.
I guess I was mistaking you.
Forgive me?
I'm sorry too.
I'm sorry that a man like Fred has to pay for all this with his health.
But I...
Well, perhaps it'll work out.
As a matter of fact, his condition may pass as quickly as it came.
But he must be handled with patience and understanding.
It's going to be difficult for you.
Nothing is difficult where Fred is concerned.
If you could possibly get him away for a short while, it would help enormously.
I'll do my best.
Good.
Still friends?
Of course.
Always.
Goodbye, Matt.
Lovely, isn't she?
Go ahead, Eddie. Make the most of it, she's all yours.
Nah.
This dame ain't like Rosie.
Why I sent for you so sudden is this, Smiley.
You've been negotiating to operate in the east the same as St. Louis.
Which is ok with me and the boys, on certain good and reasonable conditions, of course.
I got conditions too.
Oh sure. We're not going to have any argument about percentages.
There's only one question.
Shoot.
Eddie Kagle.
What about him?
Well, now that he's out free again, you heard?
Eddie ain't around anymore.
He ain't?
Ya, he was bumped out the minute he graduated college.
Oh, what do you know?
That means you're top dog now.
Nobody else.
And you're operating alone? You don't have to ask nobody about nothin'?
You're learning fast.
You wouldn't be holding out any important information on us, would you, Smiley?
Let's ask for instance.
For instance, like silent partners.
You know someone way up in political circles that's maybe getting a cut out of everything?
I told you I operate strictly alone.
We heard different.
And we heard it straight, Smiley.
You're hearing it straight from me.
Yours truly, Smiley Williams.
Alright, Smiley. If you say so.
After all, if you ain't exactly telling us the truth, they'd be complications, with somebody who'd get hurt.
It's always the other guy who gets hurt.
Not me.
Send him to the judge's house. That'll settle both of 'em.
Just get them together.
Tell you what, Smiley. I just had a thought.
Before you open up, there's a guy you gotta see.
If he gives you the ok, we'll do business.
Is he the juice?
Ya, the juice.
Now give me his name and address.
You'd better call on him right away.
If he's not at home, wait for him.
Judge?
A judge, huh?
Frederick Parker.
Better be getting on over there.
Hah. Is he the juice?
Running for governor too.
Surprised?
Yeah.
I thought you would be.
Is he tough?
Tell Les. We'll be waiting to hear how you come out.
Bye, Smiley.
So long.
My children, my children. You'd be lost without me.
The governor's mansion is alright but this is where we really live.
Should we go in?
In? Where?
In our house, silly.
Oh.
Sure.
Can't you just see it?
Shining and beautiful.
Remember darling, all the fun we had planning all this?
Location, all the rooms and the garden?
Come on, let's go up these sweden steps.
Careful now.
Now, we're on our porch.
Oh, Darling. We'd spend a lot of time out here.
After dinner in the evenings when it's quiet and peaceful.
Let's go inside.
Hey, oh wait.
What's the matter?
You have to open the door.
Oh.
Come in, dear.
Now then.
Hey.
You forgot to close the door.
When we're married, I'm going to insist that you carry me accross the threshold.
What?
When we get married, huh?
Don't say it so gloomly, dear.
It won't be that bad.
Now.
Over here is your study.
Your private sacred room.
And they'll be pictures of all the great men of law, literature, and politics.
And over here by the window, will be your law library.
And a big lounging chair for you sit down and read.
Will I wanna do any reading with you in the house?
Fred.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
There's a lot of nice things I wanna say to you.
Say them to me in there.
That's the most important room in the house.
What is it, the kitchen?
No.
The nursery.
You mean you want to live here with me and have kids?
Sit on a porch?
Of course, darling.
Look at me.
You mean with me?
The way I am?
But you see... how I talk?
I love you.
You don't see no difference?
No difference that matters.
Imagine that.
I could've had all this.
Been all this.
People calling me 'your honor' and smiling at me.
Kids making a fuss over me and me not having to hide from someone all the time.
And you.
I could've had you.
But you are all that. You have me.
I ain't.
I got nothing.
I ain't got..even got myself.
Don't say those things. As least not out here.
You promised today would be our day. You promised to forget all about the court and the election, and everything.
Please, darling.
Let's just enjoy ourselves.
I beg pardon sir but perhaps you'd prefer to come back tomorrow.
Evidently his honor is unavoidably detained.
I'll wait.
Yes sir.
You happy, darling?
Yeah.
I'm scared, too.
Of what?
I don't know.
I've never been scared of nothin' all my life.
Doctor Higgins said you--
Ah it nothin' the doctor knows about.
Something I can't figure out myself.
Except maybe...it's because I found something I never had before.
Something I want to hold on to.
Place like this.
Feeling of quiet inside me.
A new slant on things.
Ya, I'm talking screwy.
No you're not.
It makes me so happy to hear you talk like that.
Happy?
Fred, I'm beginning to find you again.
Honey, I'm...
I'm all mixed up.
You see, I...
I made a deal.
But how could I've known that I'll meet up with a girl like you?
Rather cut my arm off than hurt you.
I could puzzle it out.
Just for a couple of minutes.
Myself.
It's alright, darling.
That was a very touching scene.
What are you gum shoein' around for?
I have some nice news for you.
Remember I promised that if you help me get Judge Parker, I'd help you get Smiley?
Uh huh.
Well I happen to keep my word, even though some others don't.
I did everything you asked me.
And bungled everything too.
Instead of ruining Judge Parker, you made him more popular.
That fight in the auditorium.
Refusing the bribe in the Bentley case. And now this... fantastic belling and cooing.
A guy can change, can't he?
Oh not you, Eddie.
It's too late for that.
Sorry, but halo isn't your particular dish.
However, what I came to tell you is this.
Smiley is in town.
What's he doing here?
He's come to extend his cafe business.
He's gonna open up in this city.
With your money, Eddie.
The money you went to jail for.
The money he killed you for.
I don't know.
Getting rat don't seem important no more.
Oh no really, Eddie. You're going soft.
What's more, you're getting yellow.
Don't you never say that too me.
Then prove I'm wrong by carrying out your end of the bargain.
Well I...
I...can't leave Rosie.
I mean...
Barbara.
Smiley in town is not only a threat to you, but to
Barbara too.
You mean.. the girl is in danger with Smiley here?
Figure it out yourself.
When he sees you, if you don't get him, he'll get you.
Like he did before.
With a smile on his face.
You know what that would mean to Judge Parker.
To his body.
And where would that leave Barbara?
So you see...
Either way, for her sake
For sake of any little children she may have.
You got to kill him.
He got a way of putting things which makes sense.
Although inside me I know that...
I shouldn't follow your advice, but it's like you're saying it would only do Barbara a favor.
Protecting her kids...
Our kids, maybe.
Uh huh.
Now you're beginning to see straight.
And think clearly.
Should we go?
I gotta tell Barbara first.
Honey, I...
I gotta attend to something. Something very important.
Gotta use your car.
My car?
Well, I guess it's alright, dear. If you want to.
Thanks.
I won't be long.
Look, honey.
I want you to straighten me out on something.
I'll try dear, if I can.
If we was already married, and living in this house, and had kids... and one day a big rat full of poison came out of his hole, and showed his teeth, and went for the kids' throats, what would you do?
They'd be nothing to do but destroy it.
You mean kill it, don't you?
Yes.
Thanks.
Thanks for straightening me out.
But wait!
Kill...
Kill...
What a beautiful day.
I couldn't ask for a more delightful weather.
Take that grin off of your face.
Now please permit me the privilege of expressing my happy frame of mind with a few facial wrinkles.
Relieves the tension.
Look out I don't put some wrinkles on you.
It'll stay for keeps.
What's the matter?
I wasn't speeding.
I didn't say you was.
Let me see your driver's license.
Hah, must've left it in my other suit.
In this state, that ain't good.
How about your owner's licence?
Tell him it's your fiance's car.
Tell me you borrowed it to go to a campaign meeting where you're making a speech.
Can't you recognize me?
I'm Judge Parker. I'm running for governor in the next state.
There's a political shindig there tonight and...
I'm making a speech.
This is my fiance's car.
She just let me have it for the emergency.
What's her name?
Barbara Foster.
That's an interesting set of circumstances.
A girl by that name phoned the police and reported her car stolen.
And the description of the car and the license number was identical with the one you're driving.
I'm telling you you're making a mistake.
That's what they all say.
Any how you're going to be explaining it down at the station-house? Follow me.
Follow me.
You know this should convince you conclusively that I'm the only friend you have.
First your best pal Smiley double crosses you, and now this girl.
It ain't so the cop pulled a boner. The girlie had nothing to do with it.
Wishful thinking, Eddie. She knew you were out to kill, which meant you wouldn't be governor, and she wanted to be the governor's wife.
You're a liar.
Mankind has been beset by women since Adam and Barbara is true offshot of her grandmother Eve.
Bag.
Will you at least come to see that I'm the only person you can trust?
Stop talking to me
You're making a fire burn in my head!
Stop I tell you!
Hey, what's with you?
Who are you talking to?
Nobody, I... just rehearsing my speech.
Yeah, well, come in the other room. The lady is here, the owner of the car.
Barbara!
Barbara, tell this cop who I am.
I beg your pardon?
What's this?
Do you know this man?
I've never seen him before in my life.
Barbara, please.
Don't do this to me.
You have to file a complaint, lady.
Alright.
-Barbara, wait.
Let me talk to you.
Alone, just for a few minutes.
This may mean everything to you.
To your future.
Please.
Barbara.
There's certain things I can't tell you.
Because I know you won't believe it.
But you gotta believe this.
For the first time I can remember, I'm trying to do something for somebody else.
Without caring what happens to me.
I was beginning to change, you understand?
I done it.
Don't spoil it now.
Don't let me down.
For your own sake.
For sake of them kids.
Which is gonna sleep in that nursery you were telling me about.
Fred, you said something about making a deal.
Alright.
I want you to make a deal with me.
I'll get you out of here if you go with me to a minister.
And marry me.
Right now.
But I can't, I...
Take it up, Eddie.
And you can finish what you started out to do.
Alright.
I'll marry you.
Hey, Nick. You're going the wrong direction.
I'm going in the right direction.
Never mind.
And he said in another place,
'If anyone offend one of the weak who believe in me, for better for him--'
Where did I leave off, my given?
It were better.
For what were better?
If anyone offends.
'If anyone offends one of the weak who believe in me, it were better.'
Well?
We want to get married.
Why?
Too many people are getting married these days without asking themselves why.
Well, there's an idea.
Make a note of that for sermon.
Yes, dear.
My husband is preparing his sermon.
He'll be right with you.
Won't you sit down?
And one of the weak who'll believe in me..
What better for him, let a millstone hang about his neck, and he will cast into the sea.
And he said in another place, 'If I had offended thee, cut it off.'
It is better for thee to enter life maimed than to go into the cahaina...
Of an extinguishable fire.
You said it, brother.
His expressions of approval become confine to Amen.
Please.
For it is written that everyone shall be burned with fire and every bit of salt with salt.
And the Devil speaks to you my children, you did not for his only desire to leave you below, he's the evil one.
Watch for him.
No matter what name he introduces himself with,
Lucifer views of our Mephistopheles.
Hey.
I know him.
Where was I?
-Mephistopheles 
 -Oh yes.
Heed not Mephistopheles my children...
Lest you suffer eternal damnation.
When he whispers in your ear, you turn away your head, and hearken instead to the angel on your shoulder.
What if he ain't got no angel on his shoulder?
You have if you live right, son.
Be good, do good.
The devil wields no power over a good man.
Sit tight, honey, I'm coming right back.
Where you going?
I'm gonna tell off the devil.
Good for you, son.
The office to your left is your end of the church.
Well, Eddie.
I just came out to tell you something.
There's a smart operation in there.
What knows all the answers?
You don't say.
He even knows who you are.
You know?
Yah, Nick.
I know.
I'm afraid I'll have to take you back, Eddie. You know too much.
The dope I got says you can't get the drop on a good man.
That hardly covers you.
My record's clean in this trip.
I ain't done nothing wrong since you brought me back.
Oh Eddie, I don't have the kindest feelings towards you.
And to prove it, I want you to go right back in there, marry Barbara, and my blessings on both of you.
We don't want no blessings from you.
I'm through with you.
Beezlebub.
And therefore is not by any to be edited to lightly. but reverently.
Discreetly. Advisably.
Soberly.
And in fear of God.
Under this holy estate, these two persons come now to be joined.
If any man can show just cause, why they may not be lawfully joined together?
But now speak.
For else here after, forever hold his peace.
I require and charge you both--
Wait a minute.
Please, dear.
He brought up something important.
Honey, I gotta speak now like he says.
I can't marry you.
I'd be doing wrong.
And that's just what the devil is waiting for.
Oh dear lord.
Fred, you don't know how hard I've been trying to help you in every way.
But I'm afraid I can't go much further.
You're not only destroying yourself, you're destroying me.
And I just can't stand it any longer.
Please, let's go on with the ceremony.
But honey, I can't.
My eyes have been opened.
Marrying you now would be the worst thing I could do.
Which don't mean that you lost Fred Parker, but like you said this afternoon, you'd be finding him again.
And you'd be proud of him.
Like you always was.
Honey, if I can only make you understand...
I think I do understand, darling.
Come, I'll drive you home.
Please forgive us.
Eddie.
You have a visitor.
You might like to know that in his breast pocket, he's carrying the very gun with which he snuffed you out.
He's been carrying it around ever since.
Brings him luck, he says.
And now repay that long overdue debt with your own gun.
That's what's known as poetic justice.
Heed not Mephistopheles my children...
Lest you suffer eternal damnation.
When he whispers in your ear, turn away your head.
Parker was dead to the angel on your shoulder.
You're right Mephistopheles...
Or Nick for short.
But I ain't never put no guy what to sleep.
I'll wake him first.
It's so much simpler this way.
I made him drowsy to make it easier for you.
You make everything easy, don't you?
Alright.
Have it your way. Wake him up.
It might be more amusing.
I'll go fix him a drink.
Make him feel like old times.
Smiley.
Smiley!
Oh, who called me?
I did.
Oh.
Judge Parker.
I'm fixing a couple of drinks.
What's on your mind?
Well, I'm operating in St. Louis and other spots.
Uh huh.
And I'm interested in a couple of joints here in the East.
Bellamy steered me to you about getting a passport.
Sure, sure.
I understand.
So, as is my nature to come to the point pronto, what's your cut?
A hundred grand and 25% of the take.
Hold on, Judge.
I may be from St. Louis, but I ain't no hick.
You operating alone?
No partner?
All alone.
I heard there was a Eddie Kagle heading in your outfit.
Ya, but he's dead.
Are you sure?
Well, I ought to know cuz I...
Cuz you what?
I got the flash soon as the cops found his body.
I heard he was your pal.
Yeah, we grew up together.
I used to do his thinking, and he do my fight.
So you paid him off by puttin' four slugs in hime from his own rod.
What kind of talk is that?
You have to blackmail?
This is Smiley Williams you're talking to.
Who should know better than me?
You.
You...
Why are you so nervous?
You look like you seen a ghost.
Stop it Eddie, get on with it.
Shut up Mephistopheles.
My name is Smiley Williams.
Pleased to meet you.
They call me Judge Parker.
But maybe I ain't Judge Parker.
Maybe I'm somebody else.
Somebody you know.
No.
No! You can't be him.
Him?
Who's him?
Eddie! Eddie Kagle!
Oh, you can't be. This whole thing, it-it's screwy.
Maybe it ain't screwy.
Why don't you start figuring it out?
If I ain't Judge Parker, I must be somebody else.
Maybe I'm that pal of yours, Eddie. Eddie Kagle, the one you chopped down with his own rod.
Figuring when you're afraid of every shadow, every footstep, every sound, every dark alley you pass, every car that whizzes by,
Hold up in your hideout and go slowly nuts.
And trying to figure, is Eddie Kagle dead... or is he alive?
And then when you can't take it no more, go blow your brain out.
There it is, your own gun.
Return the compliment, Eddie.
Stop whispering in my ear, devil.
Lay off of me, will you, Judge?
I'll do anything you say.
Eddie! Eddie!
Give me a chance.
You didn't shoot him.
We had a bargain.
He was took care of a better way.
And I never even touched him.
Now you go back to your hole in the ground.
You're in my way.
I cannot go back without you.
Well, no ain't that too bad.
Listen, Eddie.
No soul has ever escaped my domain before.
I've got to get you back or I'll be jeered at and derided.
Why the upheaval would be cataclysmic in it's proportions.
What a laggard!
Looks like you got yourself behind the eight ball.
Come on, Eddie. Please.
Have a heart.
You'll have to take it up with the boss.
I'm getting my orders from him... from now on.
Must I run a follow of you again?
Am I doomed forever to be vanquished?
What has this sub-human-creature-incubated-resist-a-phoniest done to become your favorite?
It was with evil intent, he ventured forth.
He volunteered to do my bidding.
Must I be humiliated by this maggot?
I demand my rights.
You're missing the point, chum
There's an hombre called Judge Parker.
And a sweet girl named Barbara that's been playing ball with a lot of kids
Which might otherwise join up with your team.
And me, Eddie Kagle, is standing around to see that you don't mess things up.
So long as you remain in the judge's body, neither you nor he can do anything.
What's more, you're making Barbara very unhappy.
The longer you remain on earth, the longer she cannot be joined with her rightful mate.
It was you who got me in.
You were evil then. I had power over you.
I get it.
If I don't myself help you take me out of Parker's body...
Barbara and the Judge dont' get together like they should.
Alright I'll make you a deal.
If you lay off the judge and Barbara for life,
I'll go back with you.
I accept. I have to.
You ready?
Wait, I...
I want to say goodbye to Barbara first.
I cannot wait.
You'll wait and like it.
Hello?
Barbara?
I gotta see you right away.
Hop in your car and come right over.
Yeah.
Thanks, honey.
You sure are somethin' for the eyes in that outfit, honey.
Thank you darling.
I want to look my best.
You said we're going dinner and a show.
Um.
I'm afraid that's off.
Cuz...
Cuz I-I'm going away.
I ain't never coming back.
Dearest, what do you mean?
Why would you be going away?
Well, I can't tell ya cuz...
I'm afraid you won't understand, baby.
I only understand that wherever you go, I wanna go with you.
Nicks, you don't belong where I'm going.
Oh no, Darling.
Eddie?
I got everything set for you, honey. So you won't have no more trouble.
When I'm gone,
Judge can straighten everything out and...
You and him get married.
And go live in that swell house.
And have kids.
Eddie.
I have to be going now, honey.
Please, please don't. Please don't.
Darling,
I feel kinda funny.
Kinda dizzy.
Darling, go and lie down for a minute.
Yeah, yeah. I'll lie down.
I just want to tell you--
Eddie.
Bye honey.
Doctor Higgins please.
Do you know where he is?
Please try to reach him and tell him to come to Judge Parker's apartment immediately.
It's very urgent.
Thank you.
Barbara.
Barbara!
There's tears in your eyes.
What's the matter?
It's nothing.
It's nothing. Everything's fine now.
Well?
So long.
Funny.
I never thought people's faces looked so good.
There's lots of other things I never noticed before.
If I'd only known the first trip around what I know now.
When I get you down below, I'm going to take special pains with you.
I'm going to introduce you to agonies undreamed of.
I don't think you'd be so tough.
No?
-Nah.
Cuz you know why?
Cuz you made a sap of yourself.
You don't want your boys to know that.
No big shot wants to look like a sucker before his own mob.
Now if I was made a trustee--
This is sheer unblushing blackmail.
You oughta know, brother.
You oughta know.

Komdala!
What have you stolen this time, Cheetah?
Here. Hand it to me, Cheetah.
Cigarette case.
A wallet. Steely things to find here in the jungle.
Very odd.
Writing inside.
"To Gloria. Success."
"October 1928. Douglas."
Cheetah, where did you find the cigarette case?
Well, ask him, where he found it!
What is this, Cheeta?
Tarzan, I found out where the cigarette case came from and who it belonged to!
It belonged to Gloria James!
She was a famous flyer.
I was just a little girl, but... but I remember it!
She and her co-pilot left London on around the world flight.
They were never heard from again.
Listen.
"Flying through storm."
"Icing conditions at 12,000 feet."
"Losing altitude rapidly."
"Trying to persuade Graham to jump with me,"
"but he prefers to take his chances with the plane."
"Perhaps it's better."
"One of us might get through."
Rest of this is just blank pages.
Tomorrow you must take this to the trading post in Nyaga, and have them send it to England.
Better throw book in river.
Why?
This is proof of what happened to her.
What difference that make now?
Oh, there must be relatives and friends still alive in England.
This book belongs to them.
Some things better left alone.
You mean, you won't take it?
No.
Would you please tell me, why?
No.
All right.
Cheetah, stay.
Take care of Jane.
Get it outta here!
Glad to see you, Tarzan.
What brings you here?
Book.
Where did you get this?
In jungle.
The government has spent 20 years and 10,000 pounds trying to find this woman.
What woman?
Named Gloria James.
Gloria James?
Excuse me.
Trying to hold on at me?
I don't know what you mean.
No? There was a reward of a 1000 pounds to offer, dead or alive.
Might still be good.
I never heard of it.
And 5,000 more from a guy named Jessup if she were found alive. Remember?
Never heard of him either.
That's funny. It was hashed all over the newspapers, time and time again.
Jessup said this James woman was the only one who could clear him of a murder charge.
He's serving a life sentence.
You say this woman can get man out of jail?
She could if she were alive.
But she's dead.
Too bad, isn't it, Dodd?
Yeah.
To set it out for 20 years, and then find out one chance for freedom?
She's dead.
You send book to England?
Don't worry. We'll send it.
-- Won't we, Dodd?
-- Yeah.
I go.
So long.
When you send book...
...say, maybe...
...Gloria James not dead.
What do you think he means by that?
Search me.
But it's 50-50.
Hey, Trask?
Aha.
If a man's freedom depends on Gloria's presence, she may go.
But she must keep secret all she has known here.
Blue Valley will be trenched with blood because of this.
Obey the judgement of the High One, Pasco!
Tarzan shall not take this woman away!
Do not interfere, you have not the right.
Stop him!
Do not shoot!
Tarzan and the woman must not leave!
We we told to let them pass.
Tarzan has a pass to by the High One.
They go free.
Darling, I have been so worried about you.
Good.
Never go away anymore.
Thank you.
Who is here?
Who is she?
Gloria James. Lost flyer.
Gloria James?
Oh, you're playing a joke on me.
Hello.
Of course you're Jane.
Yes.
And you are?
Didn't Tarzan tell you?
I'm Gloria James.
Gloria James's plane crashed 20 years ago!
She'd be close to 50 years old now.
That's right.
Well...
If you're 50, I'll...
I'll eat Cheetah! Raw!
But I can't understand this: if you are Gloria James, then... why have you waited 20 years before you put in an appearance?
Live deep in jungle.
Only Tarzan know the way there.
Well, if you knew where she was, then... why didn't you show her the way out before?
Well...
Tarzan learned that I could free a man who's been in prison for 20 years.
Otherwise I never would have come back.
But from where?
Where have you been?
How could you live here in the jungle?
Getting late.
Tarzan, where has she been?
How can she look so young?
Soon she will not look young.
She will grow old quickly now.
We leave early in morning to Nyaga.
What do you think of Gloria James?
Phony.
I talked to her.
She knows all about flying...
...up to 20 years ago.
I've known women who were 50 and said they were 25, but I've never heard of a woman who was 25 and said she was 50.
Did you hear the story of the people living in the jungle and never seem to grow old?
I've heard a lot of wild tales about the jungle.
Should be there... something to eat or drink, that keeps them looking young?
You ask me to believe these fairy tales?
You know, if it were true, there'd be a fortune on that stuff, whatever it is.
Huh?
I know it's all a secret, but...
I'm still dying of curiosity.
Naturally.
20 years is a long time to explain away.
What are you going to tell them?
Nothing.
To be honest with you, I...
I'm frightened to death.
Anyway, I'll file a claim whatever it was when I get to Nairobi.
We'll see what happens.
In both our names.
Oh, of course!
Now it's time to take off.
If you hurry, miss James, you might still make it to the car plane to Nairobi.
Oh, I'm ready.
Good bye, Jane.
Good bye and lots of luck.
I'm giving you men, guns, and supplies.
You realize the risk that I'm taking with my money?
All I risk is my life.
There is no woman anywhere in the world that wouldn't pay any price to remain young.
Find it, and you'll be a millionaire.
You gotta get back to be a millionaire.
The going will be tough, but remember, what it's worth to you.
We still deal 50-50?
After expenses.
Good luck.
Wish me luck. I'll need it.
So...
...you do believe in fairy tales?
Well, aren't you gonna walk on my back,
Trask?
So far, so good, huh?
Yep. From here it's anybody's guest.
For 30 years I've explored every foot of this jungle.
It's gotta be in those mountains.
Make ready.
Only Tarzan knows the way here.
He must be destroyed.
I will go.
I will kill him.
Good girl, Cheetah.
Packages.
Magazines.
And letters!
This is for you, Cheetah.
A letter from Gloria!
Douglas Jessup is free!
And then they married!
Listen to this, Tarzan.
"I'm trying to persuade Douglas to return to Africa with me."
"Tarzan will understand."
"We want him to guide us back again to the Blue Valley."
The Blue Valley...
We saw it once, remember?
You will guide them back, won't you?
No!
A way there is secret.
But... I...
There's something that'll interest you.
A radio message from Gloria James.
She wants me to meet her in Nairobi and fly her to Tarzan's place.
She's got a husband with her now.
What's she coming back to Africa for?
You're asking me?
What would a woman come back for?
Sure. To keep young.
This means she wants Tarzan to guide her to that place, whatever it is.
You've got it.
No news of Vredak?
Not a word.
You know how I always say:
You want a thing done well, do it yourself.
Uhu.
Tarzan?
Same question again?
You tried to kill me! Why?
Why?
You don't keep secret.
You tell people a way to our valley.
Tarzan tell no one.
But people come. We killed them.
We kill you, too!
Tell your people Tarzan is their friend.
Tarzan your friend, too.
Go. Go!
Maybe it's Gloria. Come on, Cheetah.
They are landing.
Mr. Trask.
Hey, Mr. Dodd.
-- Surprised?
-- Yeah.
Well, we've got another surprise for you.
Jane.
Gloria...
Jane, darling.
This is my husband Douglas.
This is Jane.
-- Jane.
-- How do you do?
I really feel we don't need an introduction.
Dodd has some work to do on the plane before we go back.
Is it all right if we put a camp for tonight?
Why, certainly.
Thanks.
Tarzan will be back soon.
Shall we go to the house?
All right.
You were shocked when you saw me, weren't you?
I was already old when I reached London.
It's one thing to grow old gracefully, year by year, but...
I aged almost overnight.
I haven't told Douglas anything.
I made up my mind to return when we were married.
I felt that... but he was...
We were both entitled to the years we'd lost.
Tarzan will take us back.
Won't he?
I'll make him.
You and Douglas have the right to go back.
Match!
Meat.
Pepper.
Thank you.
You told me Cheetah is a smart monkey, but I didn't know she was that smart.
Cheetah isn't a monkey, darling.
She's a chimpanzee.
Oh. My african education is beginning.
Tarzan's coming.
Tarzan! Gloria and Douglas Jessup are here.
Dodd and Trask flew them in from Nyaga today.
Trask?
Dodd?
Yes. Come to meet Douglas.
Tarzan, are you going to be stubborn?
Tarzan, you must listen.
We go fishing, Cheetah.
But you can't go fishing!
Douglas and Gloria are depending on you!
Come, Cheetah. We go fishing!
Oh... you...
You!
You know, when... when Gloria suggested this trip, I was a little doubtful.
Oh, I wanted to see the place she'd live in, and the natives that'd be so kind to her.
Well, now I understand.
This is a wonderful country.
Mr. Jessup... huh...
Eh... just where is this place?
Oh, somewhere in the interior.
Tarzan knows a way there.
Oh, we're out of luck, Trask.
No flying for us until I can replace this part.
You mean, we're stuck here?
Yeah, it looks like it.
Unless eh... if it's on the way, maybe
Tarzan'll take us along until we can go straight off to Nyaga.
Tarzan take no one.
Gloria and man have made mistake.
Gloria and I have traveled thousands of miles.
I go.
Tarzan.
Tarzan!
He's gone.
I'll guide you.
I know the jungle, and I know the way to the Blue Valley.
Cheetah.
You help me teach Jane big lesson?
Tarzan follow.
Don't tell Jane.
We'll camp here.
Getting too dark to go on.
But I still insist, it's a great country.
Chimp scared the daylights out of me.
When we run into the lions...
You know, Dodd, that's not a least bit funny.
Lesson number one. Good one!
What's the matter? A lion?
No! Ants!
Ants...
-- Ants?
-- No, a lion!
Mr. Trask?
Are you familiar with this part of the jungle?
Lost?
No.
But I believe we've missed the trail to Nyaga.
You didn't expect us to leave you, did you?
But I can't take you.
Why not? We'll help you get through.
What's so mysterious about this Blue Valley anyway?
Mysterious?
Why wouldn't Tarzan guide us?
Don't you suppose Tarzan could be a little jealous of his knowledge of jungle trails?
Wants to keep the whole jungle to himself, huh?
But one thing is certain: if we don't find some water, we're gonna be pretty thirsty.
Hey!
We found water!
Cheetah!
Cheetah!
Cheetah!
Is the water all right?
Not set to drink...
Look at this.
Not food either.
I'm sorry I got you into all this.
Nobody's blaming you, Jane.
I'm sure we'll get through, all right?
You think so?
With that chimp passing on our food and water and turning it all down?
Where's Jane?
I wonder where we are.
Up a crick as usual.
We gotta get out of here!
Tarzan.
Still cold?
Not anymore.
Tarzan, I'm so glad you came.
I never should have stayed in that ravine after the rain started.
Jane know better next time.
We go back in the morning.
But Tarzan... we've come so far!
Can't you...
I'm sorry, Gloria.
We go back in morning.
Where's Tarzan?
I was just looking for him myself.
Dodd! Wake up!
Huh?
We've been double crossed. Tarzan's gone.
We lost two honey-moons.
Cheetah.
Follow Tarzan.
No, Cheetah.
Cheetah and I will go back.
If you think anything, that champ will change your mind.
Dodd and I know what's in that place, and we're going to get there.
This man Vredak.
Oh it's horrible.
People of Valley maybe not friendly now.
We'll go on.
Make ready.
It's Tarzan!
She can't be the same one.
You will know who she is when you hear her speak.
Her skin is wrinkled and the hair is gray.
In the outside world all grow old.
You'll remain here until the High One passes his judgement upon you.
Death to Tarzan!
-- Death to all betrayers!
-- Kill Them!
Gloria and her man want to stay.
Never leave again.
Yes.
Forever.
I wish I could welcome you more graciously, my friends.
But I have had to deal with fear.
A fear that has entered the hearts and minds of my people.
This fear... because their secret has been taken out to the world, and trespassers have attempted to conquer us.
I say again, it was Tarzan who betrayed us.
But the High One has welcomed them all.
Tarzan has deceived the High One.
Siko and I will avenge this betrayer tonight. if the way to our valley is dark, it is not so easily found.
One needs his eyes to see.
His eyes?
His eyes.
We must find Tarzan, Cheetah.
Are you keeping track of where we are?
Yeah.
We've been traveling south-south-east.
This country will be a sench to spot from the air.
The man, the woman and Tarzan have been freed by the High One.
-- Freed?
-- Yes.
The man and woman shall remain with us.
But henceforth no one may enter or leave the valley.
I see that you are impressed.
Deeply impressed.
The potency of the water is lost once it has touched the ground.
That is why it is taken from the spring.
The waters have the power to restore youth, and heal the sick.
We have kept its existence in secret from the outside world.
Lest the greediest war men to come for us and exploit our treasure.
Lilisa, bring a vial of the water, that our friends may envigorate themselves after their wears on the journey.
Dwell amongst us as one of our people.
Thank you, ma'am.
This is as far as they got.
You will be freed in time, but our secret will be safe.
To find a way here one must be able to see.
Heat it for that's right there.
Hurry, Cheetah!
More strangers.
Mr. Trask!
Tarzan! Tarzan!
Cheetah!
Cheetah!
Don't tease me, Tarzan.
What made Gloria James stay so young?
Cheetah has present for you.
Give me that, Cheetah.
Cheetah...
Cheetah!
Cheetah...
The End.

This can't be right.
Let me see that map.
- The road isn't even marked.
- That's the Irish of it.
As long as we stick to the seacoast, we can't miss Shannon.
Well, it's your hurry, not mine.
Now look, Fitz. Take it easy.
You won't be much use to
Augur if you break your neck.
- Well, it's my neck.
- Hey. I'm fond of mine too.
This'll hold us all right.
Well, you stay here with the car in case someone comes along.
I'll scout up the road a bit.
Must lead somewhere.
Don't be too sure. Irish paths are whimsical, like the Irish character.
Hey.
Good afternoon.
My friend and I, we're lost.
Can you direct me to the nearest town?
Oh. Oh, then you didn't come here looking for me.
For you?
Of course not.
I'm looking for a town where I can hire a car.
Indeed.
What might your name be?
- Eh?
- Your name.
- Fitzgerald.
- Fitzgerald!
Maybe if I knew why you were needing a car.
Look. If you don't mind,
I'm in a terrible hurry.
- Hurry.
- Mm-hmm.
It's a strange word, "hurry."
Why would you be in a hurry?
There's a very important man waiting for me in New York... and he's not the kind that you keep waiting.
"Important."
There's another one of your words.
It's plain to see that you're impatient with me, Fitzgerald.
I've enjoyed our conversation.
I'll not detain you any longer.
Thank you very much.
Then you'll not be wanting thy direction.
Oh, yes. That's right.
The water from the mountains comes into my pool with a roar... goes out with a whisper.
Down the hill it goes till it quietly reaches the sea.
And there a little village called Ballynabun.
You, sir, may do the same.
I'll go get my friend.
Thank you very much.
You're entirely welcome.
Good day to you, sir.
Oh. Good day.
Oh, is there a–
- This'll be yours, sir.
- Thanks.
And this over here, sir, this'll be–
That's-That's all right, sir.
I can take it.
Perhaps the landlady will know some way out of here.
I'm beginning to think the whole thing's a conspiracy.
I never should have listened to that old lunatic up by the waterfall.
- What waterfall is that, sir?
- The one up the stream a mile or so.
The Gentle Burn it's called.
There's no waterfall on it.
I suppose we wet our feet in a mirage, huh?
Begging your pardon, sir, but I've tramped the length of that burn... many and many's the time and I a young lad, and there's no waterfall on it.
I guess that old fella must be a friend of yours.
What old fella?
The old shoemaker with the green coat and the brass buttons.
Shoemaker with a green coat and brass buttons.
It's him.
Is everybody balmy in this country?
- You saw that waterfall, didn't you?
- No. You told me it was up there.
Oh, yes. That's right.
We hit the stream below it.
Wonder what's wrong with our friend.
Oh, he probably thinks you saw a pixie.
They're quite common in Ireland.
Yeah, well, I'll be glad to get back to New York, where things make sense.
Because people like your new boss have taken all the agreeable nonsense out of life.
I'm beginning to think you don't like Mr. Augur.
I don't. Don't like his type.
I don't like him personally.
And above all,
I don't like what he does to good newspapermen who go to work for him.
- Ah, I'm gonna take a bath.
- Sure. In a fine tub.
But for they forgot to put in the water pipes... and there's not a plumber this side of Limerick town.
- Don't take it so hard. I like the Irish.
- Yes, well, you can have 'em.
All of them, including myself.
I wish I could still have you, Fitz... but I just haven't got the price to compete with Augur.
Come in.
I brought you some towels.
Thank you. Just put 'em right here on the bed.
- All right.
- What time is dinner?
In an hour or so– if me stove doesn't take it into its head to start an argument.
It will if it's like everything else here.
You mustn't be too hard on us.
We're not used to having such grand guests all the way from America.
Oh, uh, would you tell the old lady
I'd like to see her, please?
There's only one old lady here.
You're seeing her now.
I beg your pardon.
Are– Are you the–
Oh, Mrs., uh–
Is there a chance of transportation out of here?
- If you can wait.
- Well, I can't.
Well, you see, the trouble is we're sea-locked.
There must be boats.
Pookawns and such. But they're not much good in any kind of a sea or... if the wind's wrong.
But Sean O'Fearna will be glad to take you in his boat when he comes in.
Mm-hmm. And when is that likely to be?
- Oh, he'll be back any day now.
- Any day.
Tomorrow perhaps.
By the end of the week surely.
I hope you'll be comfortable, sir.
Ah, that was a good stew, Fitz.
- It was all right, if you like lamb stew.
- I do.
Well, why don't you pour one for yourself?
Huh?
Oh, no. Herself wouldn't like it.
She says a long glass means a short life.
Oh, that's a lot of bunk, isn't it?
Why, when I was a cub reporter back in Tennessee...
I once interviewed a man on his 110th birthday.
He swore it was the result of drinking a pint of corn liquor every morning– before breakfast.
- Do you tell me that now?
- That's the truth.
You know, you'd do me a great favor if you'd mention that to herself sometime.
- I'd be delighted. Anytime.
- 110 years.
I'll take a glass of whiskey with you, as you insist... and as you're guests of the house.
Well, sit down.
We want to, uh, ask you something.
It's about this waterfall and the old man
Mr. Fitzgerald had words with.
There's no waterfall on the Gentle Burn... and it was no mortal man himself had words with.
Mm-hmm.
Who was it then?
- Oh, I mind well who it was.
- Oh, well, who?
Don't keep it to yourself, man.
It was him.
The leprechaun of the Gentle Burn.
None other.
Oh, come now.
You don't believe in those old superstitions.
I believe what me father knew and his father before him.
It was a great opportunity you had... and the saints forgive you for not taking advantage of it.
110 years of age you say.
What should I have done?
Seized him and made him give you the pot of gold. What else?
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
I wish I had thought of that.
Has anyone else ever done that around here?
Mrs. Daly's own father, Mr. William, and lived to curse the day.
- Why should he curse the day?
- He forgot to spit on the gold.
A handful of pebbles was all he had for his trouble... and bad luck for the rest of his life.
That's the rule, is it?
You have to spit on the gold?
Any little babby could tell you that.
You'd better be careful who you talk to, Fitz.
Oh, he'd best at that, when you hear the end of it.
I was here one night.
Miss Norah was away at school.
I was alone with Mr. William, and he here with the drink raging in him.
Well, he started to curse every leprechaun that ever cobbled a shoe... and he took the bottle, and he threw it into the fireplace.
And he stood up, swaying on his two feet.
"Taedy," he says...
"I'll have it out with them devils if it's the last thing I do."
And with that, out through the door... before I could raise a hand to stop him.
By your leave, gentlemen.
Well, come on. Come on, man.
What's the rest of it?
Well, uh– Well, I stood at the door, calling.
And then– then...
I heard the banshee.
It was the first time
I heard it, but...
I knew it was all over, and so it was.
The next morning, they found him by the Gentle Burn... and he struck dead altogether, the way that he ne–
The way that he never moved again.
Well, gentlemen, as I was saying... drink is the curse of the human race.
How are you, Norah?
Well, I think it's past me bedtime, gentlemen, so I'll say good night, kids.
One and all.
Taedy.
I'm ready for you, whoever you are!
Come on out!
- Mr. Fitzgerald.
- Oh, Mr. Fitz.
You gave me a start, sir.
What are you doing with that bottle of whiskey?
Shh!
Themselves have sharp ears... and they might have heard us taking their names.
You know, it's a good thing to leave a little something on the doorstep.
Oh.
But I always thought the traditional thing for leprechauns...
- was a glass of milk.
- Milk?
Good night, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Good night, Taedy.
Let me go, you bosthoon, or I'll parch your bones with fever.
- No, you don't. I've got you.
- Take your hands off me!
Not until you've showed me your pot of gold.
What would a poor, simple old man like me be doing with a pot of gold?
None of that. I'm ready for your lies.
Of course you've got a pot of gold.
No right-minded leprechaun would be caught without one.
Oh, who's been telling you such stories?
- Ah, your friend Taedy.
- Taedy?
- He put you up to this trick, eh?
- Ah, the biggest liar in all County Clare.
That may be true, but we're gonna play this game according to the rules.
Come on now.
Where's the gold? The gold.
Oh. Not so fast, my friend.
- Let me go, you omadhaun.
- Come on. The gold. Where is it?
- I'm telling you, I have no gold!
- Where is it?
- I mean business.
- Where is it, you say?
Yes, where is it?
Why don't you take a little look under the waterfall yonder?
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, no, you don't.
Ah. I've been warned to your tricks.
Where is it?
I don't– I don't know.
- Where is it?
- I don't know.
Oh, isn't that the thornbush?
Right under your very nose.
That's right. It's always buried, isn't it?
Uh-huh. Huh? Dig.
- Eh?
- Come on. Come on. Dig.
Oh.
Come on. Hurry up, man.
'Tis a cruel, wicked thing you're making me do.
Well, you certainly do it up brown.
Props and everything.
Well, I'll be.
They're real.
Real indeed.
They're a lifetime savings.
Several lifetimes, as you reckon things.
They are real.
I don't know who you are or what sort of a game you're trying to play.
- Did you steal these?
- I never stole anything in me life... except what was rightly mine.
That's one thing we have in common.
Here. Take this back.
But I don't understand you, sir.
You didn't really think I'd steal your savings, or whatever they are.
Here.
You wouldn't be playing tricks on a poor old man, would you?
No. I'll leave the tricks to you. Here.
Take it back.
Bury it again.
Go on. Bury it now.
You give it back to me?
You give it back?
Fitzgerald, I'll never forget you for this.
You've earned my undying– my undying gratitude.
Here. Take–
Take this little bit of a keepsake to remind you of our meeting.
- No, no. I–
- Yes, yes, yes. Take it. Take it.
Thank you.
No thanks are necessary. It is I that am thanking you from the bottom of my heart.
All the luck in the world to you.
Mr. Stephen Fitzgerald... you have a way of twisting things in the most perplexing manner.
It is I that am saying
"all the luck in the world" to you.
So, sir, good-bye... and good luck to you.
Oh.
You're up early, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Oh, good morning.
I couldn't sleep very well.
Oh, I hope it wasn't the bed.
No, no. I think I just had one drink too many last night.
- Kept having dreams.
- Good ones, I hope.
Strange ones anyway.
Perhaps it was Taedy's wild stories.
Or it might have been the old man who gave me the advice up by the waterfall.
What waterfall was that?
The one up the brook there.
The Gentle Burn it's called, isn't it?
But there's no waterfall on the Gentle Burn.
Come on.
- What for, Mr. Fitzgerald?
- We're gonna find out once and for all... if there's a waterfall up there.
Now listen.
I'm sure it was here.
Hey!
Who are you calling?
Well, he's a– a rather peculiar friend of mine. He–
But you must know him.
He's about the, uh–
Uh–
Well, it's– it's easy to imagine things here in the woods.
But I couldn't have imagined that waterfall.
I saw it, and I heard it.
But maybe it– maybe it is further upstream.
Yes, that– that– that must be it.
I suppose I could have forgotten about it.
Yes.
I used to come bird's-nesting here when I was a little girl.
There's a grand view of the sea.
I wish that boat would come.
Is it so very important to you?
Oh, it's the chance
I've been waiting for.
Ever since the war, I've been kicking around Europe writing freelance stuff... mostly for Bill Clark.
Now I'm ready to settle down to a real job.
Oh, but you shouldn't give up your writing now.
Oh, I don't intend to.
The only difference is that from now on
I'm going to be paid for it.
I'm sick and tired of beating my brains out for nickels and dimes.
It'll come.
You mustn't fret, Mr. Fitzgerald.
My friends call me Fitz.
- Fitz?
- Mmm.
I'd never call you that.
It– It sounds like a bottle of soda water.
Well, a few–
My mother called me Stephen.
Stephen.
Oh, I like that better.
Everyone calls me Norah.
Norah.
Oh, that's very nice.
That's always been a favorite of mine.
Norah.
If I ever had a daughter, that's what I'd call her. Norah Fitzgerald.
Norah Fitzgerald.
You're not married, Stephen?
No, I'm too fond of my freedom for that.
Oh, don't say that.
A man should marry.
It's the natural rule and a good thing altogether.
What about you?
Doesn't that same rule apply to you?
And who would I be marrying here in Ballynabun?
Michael the fishmonger?
Or Taedy perhaps?
Oh, look. It's a boat.
It's the Aranar, Sean's trawler.
Your wish has come true, Stephen.
If you start at once, he can have you in Shannon in the morning.
What's wrong?
You ever seen anything like this?
Oh, sure.
It's a doubloon.
16th century Spanish, I think.
- How could I have gotten it?
- Very easily.
There have been many of them in Ireland since the armada was wrecked here.
The farmers bring them in from time to time.
That's a nice one.
We better be on our way.
Keep in touch with me, fella.
I'll let you know if I can salvage the car.
Fine. Look me up if you ever get to New York.
Oh, not me. I'm the poor but honest type.
Well, good luck, Fitz.
Bye.
Good-bye, Norah.
Now that I'm going,
I half want to stay.
You mustn't be looking backward, Stephen... but forward to what you want from life.
Sorry he's gone?
He's a wonderful man, Mr. Clark.
It all depends on what you call wonderful.
He's a nice fellow, he has brains, he's a first-class writer, but– but he's willing to throw it all away for money– to subordinate himself to an egomaniac... to become just another bright, young man who's made good–
And you call yourself his friend... saying things like that about him the minute his back is turned.
Said the same things to his face.
He knows what's best for himself.
Don't waste your fine Irish temper, my dear. It isn't worth it.
- How do you do, Mr. Fitzgerald?
- Hello, Doc.
- Ruth.
- Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald!
- Is Mr. Augur in?
- Haven't seen you in a long time.
- Is he in?
- Yes. Mr. Fitzgerald to see Mr. Augur.
Go right in.
- Mr. Fitzgerald?
- Yes.
Please sit down. Mr. Augur said he will see you in a few minutes.
You mean he said,
"Keep the so-and-so waiting
10 minutes and then show him in."
Yes. No.
Tell him I'll be back in a couple of years.
Mr. Fitzgerald, please!
Please, Mr. Fitzgerald.
I'll tell him. I'll tell him.
Mr. Augur, Mr. Fitzgerald won't wait.
- He's on his way out–
- Oh, let him come in.
Please come in, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Hey, D.C.
You– You kept me waiting for 48 hours.
- Gosh, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.
Come in. Make yourself at home.
You know each other?
Yeah. Hello, Higgenbottom.
Higgenbotham.
Say, you've had the place done over, haven't you?
Yeah, it was my daughter's idea. Cost a fortune.
Sit down. I want to talk to you.
I haven't seen you in years.
You know...
I, uh–
Didn't you have something to do this afternoon?
- Oh, uh, yes.
- Yeah, well, do it.
He's invaluable. Absolutely invaluable.
And he drives me nuts.
Don't disturb us.
Now, why do you think
I sent for you?
I'm not very good at guessing games.
Hold on to your chair.
Fitz...
I'm gonna run for the Senate.
What for? I thought Senator Ransome owed his election to you.
Oh, Ransome's all right, but it's not the same as holding the reins yourself.
Fitz, there comes a time when a man reaches the top of the ladder in his chosen field.
There's nowhere else to go.
I've reached that point.
Other men go in for breeding thoroughbreds and... collecting paintings.
They're just toys.
Say, you know the oldest and the noblest occupation of them all?
- I think so.
- I mean politics.
Well, you'll admit there's certain points of similarity.
Oh, don't be cynical.
Politics in a democracy.
Well... where do I come in?
You're gonna put me in the Senate.
Oh, no.
I'm no politician.
Exactly.
Yeah, I read every one of your articles in the American Spectator... not that I agree with your conclusions... or the rabble-rousing policy of the paper... but one thing stands out.
You know people.
You understand the issues.
Take this piece you wrote about my Paris speech.
- Called it boneheaded.
- Dunderheaded.
Dunderheaded. Yeah, well, what– what difference does it make?
The point is you were right. You put your finger on the weakness of my argument.
I could have put my foot in it.
Well, that's exactly why I want you on my side.
Of course, I was 99% right.
Have some of this?
No, thanks.
Well, here's my proposition.
Come in with me.
Write my speeches, be my right hand.
Be my brain, my conscience.
Frankly, I want the money... but there's one thing we ought to clear up first.
You may not like what I write.
We may disagree.
Well, of course we'll disagree.
I hate people who agree with me.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a sale.
Good.
We'll show them who's a dunderhead, huh?
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Oh, those school of journalism boys. Ah–
- Oh, how's Frances?
- Frances?
Frances.
Oh. She wants you to call her.
I'm glad you reminded me.
Probably should have done it soon–
You don't mind if I use one of these?
No, it's a private line.
That one over–
What's my home number?
- Rhinelander 4-5813.
- Rhinelander 4-5813.
Uh, never mind that.
Bring in Mr. Fitzgerald's keys and his address.
- Yes, sir.
- Hello? Miss Augur, please.
Mr. Fitzgerald. I don't have any address.
I got you an apartment.
You know how hard it is to find a place, even for me?
Hello, Frances?
Fitz!
Yeah, about an hour ago.
I'm with him now.
No, the devil himself doesn't have enough money to buy it.
What? Dinner tonight?
Fine. I'd love to, if– if I don't have to work too late at the office.
You don't start till tomorrow morning.
All right. I'll tell him.
Fine. I'll pick you up–
Good. Okay. Bye-bye.
She says I can't work too late.
Ah. Takes after her mother.
Ah, here are your keys.
- Here's the address, Mr. Fitzgerald.
- Thank you.
And find out where Mrs. Augur hires servants and get him one.
Yes, sir. It's the Acme Agency.
What do you do with a servant?
I never had a servant before in my life.
We can't have you bothered with trifles.
Gotta keep that brain of yours on ice.
We're gonna do big things together, my boy.
Yes. Big things.
- Cream?
- Mm-hmm.
- What was her name?
- Whose name?
Your reason for being two days late.
Oh.
Norah.
- Pretty, I suppose.
- If you like the Irish.
I always have.
I'm glad you're back, Fitz.
And I'm glad you're going to be sensible.
- Sensible?
- Mm-hmm. You know what I mean.
It's a shame to waste your talent on the kind of writing you've been doing.
Well, some people didn't think it was entirely wasted.
Oh, but it was, as far as you yourself were concerned.
Maybe you're right at that.
I only started being sensible today... and already I have a big salary and an apartment.
- See?
- Yeah, I see.
I've missed you, Fitz.
I've missed you too.
You're a liar. You never even gave me a thought all the time you were away.
I'm surprised you even called me.
Well, I was only trying to be sensible.
After all, the boss's daughter.
Was that the only reason?
How can you be after asking a question like that?
And yourself as pretty as a bay filly in a field of clover.
Oh.
Fitz, after only five days in Ireland, that's rank affectation.
Hello, Fitz.
Well, well, look who's here.
Mary's little lamb.
Hello, Charlie.
- How are you, Higgenbottom?
- Uh, Higgenbotham.
I just rode uptown with D.C.
He'd like to get your thinking... on the Labor Management Act.
Now, my idea of– of the proper kind of statement is this–
Oh, dear, dear, Fitz.
Look at the time.
We'll never make it.
We're half an hour late for the curtain already.
- Hurry. Have you paid the check?
- No, I haven't.
Sign Father's name, Charlie.
Don't do that. Take it out of this, will you, Higgenbottom?
- Higgenbotham.
- Hmm? Oh. Yes.
Wait.
- We were a little rude, weren't we?
- Yes, we were... but I want Father and all his stooges to understand... that their jurisdiction does not extend beyond office hours.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Come on. You needn't smile quite so cordially... when you tip hatcheck girls.
- Gives them ideas.
- Well, she gave me a couple.
Oh!
Taxi, sir?
- Yes, please.
- Well, where are we going?
- Home.
- Oh, but it's so early.
Listen. I got no sleep on that plane.
It's me for that modernistic little nightmare that your father picked out for me.
- Just what do you mean, "nightmare"?
- Wait till you see it.
I'll tell you. There was a painting over the fireplace.
You don't mean to tell me that you had something–
Yes, darling, I do. But that's all right.
Don't apologize.
It's nothing to me that I slaved for three whole days to make a nice place for you. I–
- What did you do with the painting?
- It's in the bathtub.
The bathtub. Hmm.
What else?
- Well, I– I just rearranged a few things.
- Oh, you did.
There was a table by the fire that I moved around on the other side.
Then there was a lady and gentleman–
Yes. We'll just go right up there and re-rearrange them back again– the table and chair–
16 Beekman Place, please.
I don't think you need to.
- I'm quite tired. I–
- Oh, yes, Fitz. We do. Really, we do.
- You heard her, brother.
- Yes, sir. I heard the lady.
Little more to the right.
That's right. Ah. There.
Whoop.
- There. That's fine.
- Huh.
Now, really, Fitz, don't you like it?
Oh, it's absolutely breathtaking.
- What's it supposed to be?
- It's called Germinal, 1948.
- Hmm.
- It's the coal strike.
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.
I thought it was Venus rising from the waves.
Oh. Fitz, it's by a very promising young artist.
I'm arranging a show for him.
- You're a busy little thing, aren't you?
- Just what do you mean by that?
Oh, arranging shows, decorating apartments... convincing your father that he needed a ghostwriter.
I didn't say I had a thing to do with that.
No. I know.
But I suspected it as soon as I got his cable.
- So, what are you going to do? Resign?
- No.
No, I'm gonna do the job that I was hired to do.
But I would like to know what it's going to cost me.
Not a thing, darling.
It was sheer altruism on my part.
Altruism?
All of a sudden you're an altruist.
Well, don't you think–
- I think that I need a drink.
- Shall I tell you why I hate you?
- No, I–
- 'Cause all the time you were away... you kept coming between me and whatever I was doing.
Because I saw your face in crowds, in the street... in my mirror when I was alone in my room... because I ate, dreamt, slept, lived you– you and your black magic.
I hate every inch of you.
I hate your superiority, your black Irish eyes... and your arrogant nose.
What was that?
Oh, it must be the door.
- Oh, yes?
- I'm from the Acme Employment Agency, sir.
Oh, the, uh–
- Well, come in. Come in.
- Yes, sir.
Kitchen's right in there, if you don't, uh, mind waiting for a minute or so.
Fine time of night to be sending people over.
Well, did you say you wanted him tonight?
No. Must have been your father's secre–
Oh, well, that explains it.
The well-known Augur efficiency.
Fitz, what is it?
Fitz.
Haven't I seen you someplace before?
I wouldn't rightly know, sir.
It depends on where you've been.
I've been to a great many places, including Ireland.
Indeed, sir?
- Where'd you come from?
- The Acme Employment Agency, sir.
- Before that.
- Me last place, sir.
- Where was that?
- Oh, there were no complaints, sir.
No complaints at all. I take great pride in my work and joy in my service.
- What on earth's the matter?
- That man.
I have a feeling I've seen him someplace before.
Oh, well, he probably worked for one of your friends or something.
You know, these servants get around.
Yes, I guess that must be it.
- Well, I'm gonna have that drink.
- Good.
I bought your favorite brand of scotch. Here.
Well. Where'd you hide it?
I'll find it for you.
It's right down here.
- There it is.
- Ah, you think of everything, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.
- Bourbon too?
Bourbon too.
Two cases in the kitchen.
- What else?
- This.
Can I help you, sir?
Uh, yes.
- Mix us a drink.
- A drink.
Yes, sir. Right away.
Never mind the drink, Fitz.
I'm going.
- There's too much traffic in here.
- It is a little crowded.
- See you home?
- No, don't bother. I'll take a cab.
I'm sorry about that man of mine.
Oh, everyone's having servant problems these days.
Take me to lunch tomorrow?
- I'll stop by your office tomorrow.
- Fine. Good night.
- You can throw that one away now.
- Yes, sir.
Throw it away, sir?
Couldn't you drink it yourself, sir?
Ah, 'tis a great pity.
One should not waste good food, one should not.
It's only one drink.
Still, it'll save a man from freezing to death... or dying from fatigue, it could.
All right. All right.
Drink it yourself.
Well–
If you insist, sir.
- To your good health, sir.
- Sit down.
Yes, sir.
Sit down. Sit down.
- The agency sent you, hmm?
- Yes, sir.
What can you do?
Oh, anything you have a mind for me to do, sir.
I can cook, clean, take care of your clothes.
Anything at all, at all.
What would one call you?
Well, you might call me Horace.
I've always had a fancy to be called Horace.
Horace. If that's your name, we'll call you Horace.
Thank you, sir.
What about your salary?
Oh, that's all been taken care of, sir.
Oh, Mr. Augur's office.
Horace, you– you made that too strong.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to be patient with me till I know your taste.
And another thing.
I don't like to be disturbed when I have visitors.
Always knock on the door before you come in.
Yes, sir. I'll keep it in mind.
I think that's all.
You can finish your drink and then go to bed.
Thank you, sir.
That's too strong for you, hmm?
Hmm. I'll throw it away.
And what can I do for you?
I'm from the Acme Employment Agency.
I was told there's a position for a gentleman's gentleman.
You're too late.
The position's filled.
I demand to see the master.
And what would you be telling him?
That you got the sack from your last place for getting into the port?
Not to mention pinching the parlormaid till the poor girl was black-and-blue.
Away with you, you omadhaun, or you'll feel the back of my hand.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Horace.
- Who was that?
- Oh. Nobody at all, at all.
Just make yourself comfortable.
I'll have your breakfast here before you can say Michael McGillicuddy.
- Horace, has the paper arrived?
- I'll get it for you, sir.
- Horace.
- Sir?
What are we doing with all this milk?
- What milk, sir?
- The milk.
I thought you might have a cat.
Now, Horace–
- I'll get your paper, sir.
- Look here, Horace.
I'll go and–
I'll answer that.
Sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Fitzgerald.
- Was your milk delivered this morning?
- Yes.
Two homogenized, one coffee cream and a pound of butter?
Yes. I guess so.
Why do you ask?
Why, everybody else missed their deliveries.
I don't get it.
I left it on every doorstep as per schedule.
- Thanks, Mr. Fitzgerald.
- Every day I leave milk on–
Hello, Acme Employment Agency?
Uh, this is Mr. Fitzgerald–
Stephen Fitzgerald speaking.
Yes, I'd like to inquire about a manservant that you sent up here to me.
That's right.
What do you know about him?
He came to us very highly recommended,
Mr. Fitzgerald.
Oh, yes. We've had him in several positions.
Stealing?
No, sir.
You might consult his references.
I could give you the names, if you'd like.
No, no. Never mind.
That won't be necessary.
Thank you.
You stole that milk, didn't you?
Why would I be doing such a thing, sir?
I can think of one explanation... but it would mean
I'd be losing my mind.
Have you ever seen this before?
- I'm a poor man, sir.
- Answer yes or no.
I've never seen it before in all my life, sir.
There's one thing certain.
You can't stay here.
You're too disturbing.
I'll give you a month's salary, but you'll have to leave.
- Leave, sir?
- Yes. Right now.
Here, here. Stop that.
I said stop it, Horace!
I can't help it, sir.
I've displeased you, and I wanted so much to serve you.
For heaven's sake, stop that crying.
The best master I ever had in my life, and I've ruined everything.
- I'm a failure.
- All right, all right. I take it back.
You can stay.
Only stop that bawling!
I knew you didn't mean it, sir.
You'll never regret your decision.
The first thing you're going to do is turn that milk back. Every bottle!
Yes, sir.
Every bottle of it.
Hello?
This is the Acme Employment Agency.
Is this Mr. Fitzgerald?
It is.
You don't say.
Well, I've changed my mind.
You may consider the matter closed.
You should have kept out of this bridge traffic, Horace.
I'm late as it is.
- There's plenty of time, sir.
- I have a very tight schedule today.
I have lunch with
Miss Augur at 1:00.
I want you to pick me up at 2:00 sharp and drive me to campaign headquarters.
After that, I have a press conference at the office at 3:00... and then the Women for Augur.
Ye– What women are they, sir?
The Women for Augur, a group of public-spirited citizens.
What's the matter?
'Tis a slight indisposition of the machine, sir. Nothing more.
You!
What are you gonna do, spend the weekend?
Didn't you hear me blow the whistle?
What do you think you're doing here?
I stopped to admire the view.
What else?
None of your back talk, or I'll run you in.
It would take you and 10 more like ya.
Is that so?
Come on!
Get that car outta here!
- What might your name be?
- My name's me own affair.
- You don't say so!
- I've just said so.
Say, you have a sharp enough tongue to be a Kerry man.
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm from County Clare.
County Clare, is it?
But I've relatives who live by the Lakes of Killarney.
- You do indeed?
- I do indeed.
It's 30 years since
I left the old country.
You don't say.
Perhaps I know some of your people.
It's likely I do.
No, you wouldn't– Simple, humble people.
Come on, Horace!
Do something!
Get out, all of you!
I can't wait around any longer, Horace.
I'm going to have to take a taxi.
May I suggest that you take the subway, sir?
What you lose in dignity you'll gain in time saved.
Very well. Put this thing back together and pick me up at the restaurant at 2:00 sharp.
Yes, sir. I hope you enjoy your lunch, sir.
- I'll give you a little push to the curb.
- Won't be necessary, thank you.
Lots of room for everybody.
- Move right in. Come on. Step lively.
- Quit your shovin'!
Step lively. Come on, hurry, please.
Step right in.
Yeah, one more. Come on. Step right in.
That's it. Over here.
Doors closing.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You know how it is with the rush hour.
It's– I-It's just terrible here... because the car goes around a turn.
- It's all right. I–
- And, you know–
- Pardon me. Let me brush your hat.
- That's all right. I have it.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- It's all right.
- And such a beautiful hat too.
- Thank you very much.
It is really beautiful.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Stand back. Let the people out!
Let 'em in, mister.
Plenty of room in the back.
Push on in back.
Plenty of room in the back!
Norah!
Norah! Norah.
You here!
It's– It's impossible.
- Oh, I didn't expect to see you.
- But you in New York– it's a miracle!
Oh, it's hardly that. There's a perfectly reasonable explanation for it.
It's still a miracle.
A succession of miracles.
You see, my car broke down and I had a very important luncheon engagement.
My chauffeur advised me to take the subway.
It's the first time I'd been in one since
I got back to New York.
But if I hadn't taken that particular train,
I never would've found you.
Let's move up. Where are you staying?
How long have you been here in New York?
I can't answer everything at once, Stephen.
I've been here about a week.
- And you haven't called me.
- But I didn't know where you were.
I'm stopping with Taedy's Aunt Bridget's cousin Mrs. Crimmins up the street.
- That's just not true.
- Oh, it is!
No, no, no. You. I mean your being here in New York.
- Here, let me take those packages from you.
- Oh, thank you, Stephen.
Oh!
I hope there's nothing in there that'll break.
- How long are you going to be here?
- As long as my business takes me.
Take hold of my arm.
I don't want to risk losing you again.
You'd think it were something unnatural and wonderful that I should be here.
Well, it's wonderful, whatever else it is.
Oh, wait, wait.
I promised little Dennis I'd bring him some candy. How much is this?
- Fifty cents.
- Ah.
Half a buck.
Four bits.
I couldn't change that.
I just sent the boy out for some change.
- Stephen, would you mind?
- Yes. Hold it.
That's funny.
I could've sworn I had–
My man must've let me go out without my wallet this morning.
You couldn't change a doubloon, could you?
No, not your lucky piece.
I'll wait for my change.
I was thinking of having my lunch.
Mrs. Crimmins's cousin's son-in-law Cornelius has a bar and grill on the corner.
You wouldn't care to join me, would you, Stephen?
Oh, I'd like to, Norah.
Except that I have a very important luncheon engagement... and after that three or four conferences– the usual thing.
Sure you have.
I won't press you.
Though I hate to eat alone.
Gee, I wish I could, Norah.
You... wouldn't refuse me out of pride, would you, Stephen?
Pride?
I don't quite underst–
- Gee, thanks!
- Here you are, lady.
Thank you.
Forgive me for speaking of your affairs.
I could cut my tongue out for it.
You mind if I change my mind and accept your invitation?
Would you, Stephen?
I was never a man to argue with miracles.
- Good, huh?
- Excellent.
Oh, no more for me, thank you.
Oh, now, Stephen, you had hardly any at all.
'Tis me wife's own
Irish stew, sir... and that light it wouldn't distress a canary.
Well, just a very little bit.
Ooh!
A little bit.
- You'll have some beer with it.
- No more beer, thank you.
Just a small one.
And yourself, Miss Norah?
No, my tea'll be plenty.
Are you expecting many people?
Well, if all come that me old lady has invited... the place'll be running over into the avenue itself.
Cornelius's daughter is getting married Friday.
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
If you'd care to attend–
I'd like to, but my time is pretty well taken up right now.
If you change your mind you're entirely welcome. The more the merrier.
- Thank you.
- Cornelius, I'll take the check.
Eat now.
Oh, yes.
You still haven't told me why you're here.
Oh, it's very simple.
Taedy's uncle Peter died here in New York and left him a bit of money.
Mmm.
That's Mr. Crimmins, hmm?
No, no. His Driscoll uncle from Galway.
The one that married the eldest Brady girl... whose father had the farm next to Sweeney's.
Oh, that one.
Yes. You see,
Mr. Driscoll had four sisters.
The eldest was married to Francis Corrigan... that had a public house in Limerick with his brother Seamus.
Well, that failed for drinking with the customers... so my father took Taedy on as a lad to help with the horses.
- Then he came to America.
- Corrigan.
No. No, Uncle Driscoll, as I'm telling you.
You see, his favorite sister was Kathleen– that's Taedy's mother.
And when young Paddy went to sea in 1920... he changed his will, leaving everything to Taedy.
He never cared much for Rory or that little witch of a Ryan girl he married.
There was some trouble with the O'Sheas, of course.
Mmm. Of course.
They figured that their mother, being the eldest, was entitled to a share.
But Martin O'Shea had done well in marriage... with the O'Dooleys from up Knocknasheega... and that was only a bit of an inheritance, a few shillings a month... so there was no trouble to persuade them not to make any complications.
That made everything very simple.
Oh, well, it would have been...
but for Uncle Driscoll being a bit hazy in his notions...
and thinking that Taedy was a girl.
So he left his money to his beloved niece.
Can you imagine?
I, uh, can't think what confused him.
Anyway, someone had to come to straighten things out, and Taedy wouldn't budge.
He mistrusts the sea and refused flat-out to set foot on the Atlantic.
He said, "I'd rather die a poor man, but a dry one."
So that's why I'm here.
I'm, uh, very glad you made it plain to me.
And I'm very glad you're here.
Oh, Stephen,
I never thought I'd see you.
When I knew I was coming, I wrote that nice Mr. Clark in London for your address.
- But he didn't answer.
- He's probably on the Continent.
He did tell me one thing, though, before he left– that anytime, whatever might happen... he'd be glad to have you back with him.
Did he say that?
If it's a question of passage money,
I'm sure he'd advance it.
- Well–
- Oh! A bit more of the nice stew!
- Oh, no. I couldn't.
- But you had very little before.
- But I-I–
- Aw, come on, now.
A drop of this'll do you good, make you strong as a horse.
All right, Cornelius.
Do your duty.
- And another potato.
- Another potato.
Another potato.
Mr. Augur, a personal question.
As a former newspaperman,
how's it feel to be against the wall instead of on the firing squad?
It feels awful.
Except I know you fellas will give me a break.
Do you think there'll be another war?
- I answered that a few minutes ago.
- No, you didn't.
But then, nobody else has either.
I understand you support the Crawford proposal for Germany.
Absolutely. That's a must, as far as I'm concerned.
I'd like to read you a comment on this proposal. Quote:
"The Crawford proposal is a fraud on the German people...
"a death sentence for European democracy... and a betrayal of American interests and ideals." Unquote.
This appeared in the American Spectator on June 6... under the byline of Stephen Fitzgerald... the same Stephen Fitzgerald who is running your brain trust today.
Would you like to comment? Or perhaps
Mr. Fitzgerald would like to discuss it.
Well, boys–
The answer to that is very simple.
When Fitz wrote that, he was working for someone else. Now he's working for me.
Fellas, let me change my shirt, will ya?
I haven't sweat this much since my first job carrying a hod.
You got any pictures of yourself carrying a hod?
Sorry. I didn't know
I was going into politics then.
- So long, Fitz.
- Bob.
- See you, Fitz.
- Bye.
Good to see you, Fitz. Why don't you drop around to the club sometime?
Well, they keep me pretty busy.
Yeah, we all have to make a living.
- Give me a ring, hmm?
- Right.
- Good-bye, sir. Thank you.
- Good-bye.
- Thanks a lot, Mr. Augur.
- Not at all.
You handled that perfectly, D.C.
I was afraid for a minute that–
Do you want anything else, Mr. Augur?
No, thank you.
Should have told me about that piece, Fitz.
You read it, didn't you?
Yeah, I read it, but I didn't remember it was so strong.
It'd be embarrassing if the opposition made an issue of it.
But you knew those were my views when you hired me.
Well, this is politics, Fitz.
- Where'd you put that bottle?
- Let me do it, D. C.
This is politics.
Gotta keep one jump ahead of 'em.
Right away, D.C.!
Not you.
I've got it. You'll do a piece for New Era.
We don't go to press till tomorrow night.
On foreign policy– second thoughts since you've had a chance to study the situation.
You know, on the other hand the Crawford proposal is not as bad as you first thought.
A pretty good thing, in the long run.
My agreement with you calls for perjury, but not under my own byline.
Fitz.
Have that thing on my desk by tomorrow noon.
Here you are, D.C.
What are you doing here?
I let you go out this morning without a clean handkerchief, sir.
I hope you forgive me. I was thinking about it all the time I was dusting.
I said to myself,
"There's poor Mr. Fitzgerald writing all those important political speeches...
and him without a handkerchief to put to his nose."
That's very good of you, Horace.
Now, if you don't mind,
I have some work to do.
- Yes, sir.
- And after this, if you forget anything... you don't need to come chasing after me.
There's such a thing as taking one's job too seriously.
Oh, no, sir.
Not when your heart's in your work.
It's just a job, Horace.
No, sir.
It's more than that.
'Tis a life, indeed.
When a man enters the personal services of another man... he must be prepared to surrender himself to his vocation.
'Tis the master who matters, not the man.
And soon, if the man takes to his work... the master's wish will become his wish... the master's thought his thought... the master's soul his soul.
When the master gets hurt, the man will cry out.
When the master's nose itches, it will be the man who sneezes.
He will live for his master, not for himself.
Perhaps you find it difficult
to understand, sir, because you– you are the type that wears no man's collar.
You are a proud, free man.
It is for that reason that I am proud to serve you.
Will that be all, sir?
Yes. Yes, Horace, that'll be all.
Thank you, sir.
- Mr. Fitzgerald!
- Where's Mr. Augur?
- He's gone out, sir.
- When will he be back?
- I don't expect him back this afternoon.
- Where can I reach him?
I don't know. But if it's important,
I know he'll be home for dinner tonight.
He's expecting some guests.
- Have some more steak, Senator.
- No, thanks, D.C.
I lost my appetite 20 years ago.
- You'll find out.
- I already have.
I'll pay for this in the morning.
- What is it, Jenkins?
- There's a Mr. Fitzgerald to see you, sir.
He says it's important.
- Ask him to come in.
- Yes, sir.
Paula, were you listening to the judge's conversation?
- Yes, I was!
- Wasn't it brilliant?
No, it was boring!
Come on in, Fitz.
Come in.
So good to see you.
- I believe you know everyone here.
- Yes.
Mrs. Augur, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be finished.
That's quite all right.
Senator Ransome, this is Mr. Fitzgerald, my good right hand.
- Ah, yes. I've heard of this young man.
- Senator.
Have some dinner, Fitz.
No, thank you. I'd like to see you alone, if you don't mind.
Sit down. We'll be through–
I'd rather wait in the study, if it's all right with you.
Sure. Make yourself a drink while you're waiting.
Thank you. Excuse me.
I'll help him.
Will you excuse me?
How much do you want for Mr. Fitzgerald, D.C.?
- He's not for sale.
- Really?
I understood he was.
Well, I hear Father's been his usual sweet, tactless self again.
Never mind the drink, Frances.
I'm not in the mood.
Now, really, Fitz–
As you were instrumental in getting me this job... perhaps you'd like to be the first to read my resignation.
I hope you know what you're resigning from.
I think your father made that quite clear this afternoon.
I guess I shouldn't tell you this because it's still supposed to be a secret... but I happen to know what he has in mind for you.
He hasn't let me in on the secret yet.
If he wins the election... he's going to have to find someone to run the publishing house.
Naturally, he'd prefer to promote somebody in his own organization... somebody who understands the Augur way of doing things.
Go on.
Of course, it would have to be somebody he can trust.
Or manage.
What about Higgenbottom?
Oh, no, Fitz.
This isn't a job for a yes-man.
It's for a man who has the intelligence to recognize his big chance... patience to wait for it and the resolution to seize it.
Father's a bit of a fool to go into politics.
He has more power right now than a dozen senators.
The man who sits in his office will inherit that power.
Not if he's still running things by remote control.
- He won't be. I'll see to that.
- You? How?
Leave that to me.
D.C. Augur will be perfectly happy making speeches in Washington... while Stephen Fitzgerald makes history here in New York.
Well, it's a very alluring prospect, but–
Of course you'd use the power for good, Fitz, but the important thing is to have it.
It's all very well to have ideals... but what good are they if you can't reach the people with them?
- But I'm not sure that's what I want.
- It's what I want.
But you have it now.
No, I haven't.
I can wheedle certain things... but I'm not a partner.
You go with the job?
If you want me, Fitz.
Got some cigars here–
Oh.
Excuse me.
Here they are, Senator.
You needn't have waited up for me, Horace.
I thought you might require something, sir.
- I'd like a drink.
- Yes, sir. Right away.
- Fix one for yourself too.
- Thank you very much, sir.
I'd like you to drink to my health, Horace.
I'm going to be married.
Aye, indeed, sir?
Would it be the tall lady, sir?
Hmm?
Oh, Miss Augur. Yes.
Ah.
You're a fortunate man.
She'll make a fine mother for your children.
There's more to marriage than just having children, you know, Horace.
Oh, indeed there is, sir.
In riches and poverty, sickness and health... love, honoring and obeying.
She'll make you a fine wife, sir.
It's a very important decision... probably the most important that a man makes in his life.
Oh, indeed it is, sir.
May I ask what prompted you to make it?
Well, one doesn't stop to analyze one's behavior when one's in love.
No, sir, but there must be something about the tall lady... that made you select her as your partner for life.
- Well, she's beautiful, for one thing.
- She is indeed, sir.
- With a man's courage and a man's brains.
- Yes.
Is there anything wrong with a woman's courage and a woman's brains?
We won't discuss it any further.
No, sir.
You have something against her, haven't you?
Me, sir?
No, sir, nothing at all, at all.
No one's forcing you to stay here and keep on working for me, you know.
No, sir. After the wedding
I'll be looking for another place.
You don't have to make up your mind right now, Horace.
You'll have no further need for me after that, sir.
Will that be all, sir?
- Yes, that'll be all.
- Yes, sir.
- Good night, Horace.
- Good night yourself, sir.
Oh. The saints forgive me, sir.
I forgot to tell you that I waxed the floor.
Yes, Horace.
It was very thoughtful of you, Horace.
This is good, Fitz!
It's great!
I like this ad-lib finish.
I think it's just perfect for the Journalists Club.
Sort of one newspaperman to another.
How would it be if I put my hands in my pockets?
You know, informal, homespun.
I wouldn't get too homespun.
You're liable to unravel.
Yeah.
Mustn't overdo it.
But this speech could be one of the most important in the campaign... if we don't make any mistakes.
- You're certainly right there, D.C.
- Of course I'm right.
Don't you have anything to do this afternoon?
No. I'm all finished for the day.
Finished for the day.
Well, this is our chance to recapture the working press.
Well, if you don't have any further suggestions or criticism...
I'll see if I can get that deathless document mimeographed.
By the way, I've arranged for you to sit at the speaker's table tonight.
- I wasn't planning to attend.
- Well, change your plan.
My agreement with you doesn't cover the way I spend my evenings.
In this case it does.
Take it easy, Fitz.
If these were normal conditions
I wouldn't insist... but you're a member of this Journalists Club.
What'll your friends say if you don't show up?
- Assuming that I have any friends left.
- Ah, you're oversensitive.
There aren't 50 newspapermen in this town who entirely agree with their paper's policies.
Our relationship's a little different, isn't it?
Sure, but this is politics.
- Politics makes–
- Strange bedfellows. I know, I know.
I haven't been sleeping very well lately.
Well, if I'm not complaining, why should you?
Consider what Lincoln had to put up with.
Here, have some of this.
Thank you.
There's a gentleman to see you, sir.
- Well, Bill, you old son of a gun!
- Hello, Fitz!
- How are you? It's good to see you!
- Fine.
What brought you– Sit down.
Sit. Can I fix you a drink?
No. It's a little early.
How about a cigarette?
Oh, I keep forgetting. You gave 'em up.
What brought you to New York?
The Spectator is calling in all its foreign bureau chiefs.
You know, consultation.
You live here, Fitz?
- Yeah.
- I see.
Oh, I'm not responsible for the decoration.
A friend of mine did those.
But I'll be giving the place up soon anyhow.
Sure, sure. I understand.
Pretty expensive keeping a man, eh?
Huh?
Oh, I don't pay him.
- Oh?
- No, no. Augur. Augur does it.
Augur. You're still working for Augur.
Well, of course.
Look, fella, you don't have to put it on with me.
What did you do?
Tell him where to head in?
Sure. Then he passed the word around. I know.
Have you been drinking?
Fitz, I have return plane reservations for Monday. I've got some for you too.
- You're going to Italy for us.
- Bill, I–
It's a break for me, whatever happened.
Norah's cable arrived just as I was leaving for the airport in London.
- Norah's cable?
- Sure. She's a girl in a million.
- What did she say?
- I got it right here.
I wired Bronson and got his okay to sign you.
I had no idea– no idea she'd do anything like this.
Like what?
She got it into her head that I was broke.
- I should have told her the truth.
- The truth?
Yes, I'm still working for Augur, Bill.
- You're–
- Yeah, of course.
I should have known it was too good to be true.
Gonna explain that to Norah?
I should've done it before this, but I've been busy and–
You'd better make it good.
I'll be on my way.
- Let's get together before you go back.
- I'll see you tonight.
- I'm going to hear your boss.
- Don't waste your time.
Why not? I hear he makes a good speech.
Here, that's yours.
- Oh, where can I reach you, Bill?
- The Nelson.
- So long, Fitz.
- Bye.
Oh.
Excuse me, sir.
The tall lady called, sir. She wants you to take her to the Jennison reception.
She said she'd call back again, sir.
- The tall lady, sir!
- Oh, yes.
You talk to her, Horace.
Tell her I'm tied up or something.
Make it sound good, hmm?
Yes, sir.
Stephen!
- Stephen! You came after all!
- Yes. Bill Clark came to see me.
- He's here?
- Norah.
- Now, uh, you say that Bill is here?
- Yes, Bill's here.
He came to see me in my apartment, and he offered me a job.
Oh, I'm so glad.
When'll you be coming back?
Well, listen, Norah, I–
What's the matter with you?
This is the second time. Why don't you–
- Norah? Norah!
- Oh, Stephen.
Stephen Fitzgerald, this is Terence Flaherty... of Hook and Ladder Company 38, the pride of the New York Fire Department.
- Well, Mr. Flaherty. How do you do?
- How do you do?
What's the matter?
- Do you smell smoke?
- Smoke?
Yes.
Back room perhaps, hmm?
Back room?
Yes. Definitely smell smoke from someplace.
Might very well be back there.
I'd have a look if I were you.
Come on. Let's try it over here again.
Now look, tell me about that job of Bill's.
Just what did you say to him in your cable?
Oh! He got it then!
- Yes, he got it then.
- Oh. You'll forgive me for that.
I had no right to interfere in your affairs.
But, Stephen, it wrung my heart to see you like that. I hope I haven't offended you.
You couldn't offend me if you tried.
Welcome to the party, sir!
I'm certainly glad you were able to make it.
Here. Drape that over your tonsils.
Norah, I have a confession to make.
I have a job.
- You have?
- A very good job.
I'm well on the way to being a very rich man.
You lied to me.
- No, I didn't lie to you.
- You did so.
Then it was the truth, all that about the motorcars and drivers and important appointments?
Yes. If it was the truth, how could I be lying to you?
Don't try to wriggle out of it.
Just go tell Terence Flaherty that I'm not busy.
You're not angry, are you, Norah?
Of course I'm not angry, being made a fool out of in broad daylight.
- Well, I tried to tell you that–
- You did not!
There's no smoke out there.
- Well, you'd better try upstairs.
- Oh!
Oh, Stephen Fitzgerald, you're a wicked and deceitful man.
And me filling you up with Irish stew.
Well, it was wonderful stew.
It was not. She puts too much flour in the gravy.
But I'm glad you got what you wanted from life.

I'd like to, but I–
I'm going to the country for the weekend... with my fiancée.
I'm being married in a month.
I wish you happiness, Stephen.
Good-bye.
Good evening, sir.
Perhaps you can explain this to me.
'Tis a bit of an old pebble, sir.
A half an hour ago that was a coin from your pot of gold.
What sort of wild talk is that?
You know very well what sort of talk that is.
May I ask what's on your mind, sir?
- The truth, Horace. I want the truth.
- Keep your distance, Fitzgerald!
Away he went!
- Let me go.
- Now I got ya.
- Come clean now.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, you don't, eh?
What about this shoe, huh?
Take your hands off me, Fitzgerald.
I'll be happy to give you any information you require.
You are the leprechaun, aren't you?
And– And I'm crazy.
I've been crazy ever since that first night in Ireland.
I'll answer your questions in turn.
I am... what you say I am.
The term, perhaps, is not quite the best usage.
As to your mental condition...
'tis true you're a bit on the weak-minded side... but you're as sane as you'll ever be.
Aren't you a little large for a leprechaun?
That's a page in me family history we won't go into, if you don't mind.
I'm parched from all the exercise you've given me.
You mind if I have a drink?
Do you mind, sir?
You brought Norah over here, didn't you?
No. You brought her here yourself, Fitzgerald... long ago, in your mind.
Her physical presence alters nothing.
What are you trying to do, ruin my life?
Let's discuss the matter calmly, Fitzgerald.
Do you mind?
You must believe me when I tell you that
I was prompted by the noblest of motives– simple gratitude and affection for yourself.
It was for that reason that I left me native waterfall to come here and dwell in your– in your cold, inhospitable city.
And I don't mind telling you...
I'm a little bit homesick.
My nose itches for the smell of peat... and me eyes water for the sight of a blackthorn in bloom.
'Tis sad indeed that I've been unable to complete me mission... and that I must leave you in failure.
But I didn't ask you to come.
To be sure you didn't.
But then, you don't always wait for an invitation... to follow the brave music of a distant drum.
You see, I've learned to like you.
Still, I suppose
I must be philosophical.
There will be other centuries to come.
And other young men... with a nose for treasure.
I offered you gold.
'Tis not my fault that you prefer a pebble.
Horace, I–
I've tried to give you, as sincerely as I can... my view of the issues of the campaign.
Not that I expect you all to agree with me.
Frankly,
I'd be a little worried if you did... as long as a good, healthy disagreement is the essence of a free press.
I hope you won't be too hard on me.
Remember, I used to be an honest newspaperman myself.
Off the record, I wish I still were.
Well, I'd like to make a little announcement.
If I'm lucky enough to win the election...
I intend to resign from Augur Publications.
I've given a good deal of thought...
to the selection of the man who will take my place.
I didn't have to look far.
For the past couple of months,
I've been honored... to work with one of the best newspapermen of our time.
You all know him as a first-rate reporter...
and a whale of a good fella.
Steve Fitzgerald!
Come on up here!
Go on, say something, Fitz.
Well, I'm– I'm very grateful to Mr. Augur for his– his very flattering offer.
But I can't accept.
In the first place,
I wasn't cut out for the job.
And in the second place...
Mr. Augur should have someone in charge of his publications...
who agrees with him on the issues.
Is this on the record, Fitz?
Can we quote you?
- Well, I–
- What are your own plans, Fitz?
I– I haven't any.
I haven't any except... to sit under a waterfall with an old friend of mine.
Fitz, come back.
Fitz!
Give us some more, will ya, Fitz?
- Just a moment!
- We're all here! How about a statement?
Mr. Augur,
do you have any–
- You're seriously leaving?
- You can tell us more than this!
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, fellas.
I've said enough.
You heard it all.
- Any chance you'll change your mind?
- I'm resigning now, for good.
What about the engagement?
Is it on or off?
I'm afraid that's up to Miss Augur.
How about that, Miss Augur?
Are you gonna share that waterfall?
I don't think I'm invited.
But even if I am, as Mr. Fitzgerald would say...
I'm afraid I wasn't cut out for the job.
Good-bye, Fitz.
Good-bye, Frances.
Good-bye.
- Hmm?
- It's well-written, Fitz.
But I don't agree with a word of it.
What's wrong with it?
Anyone who knows a thing about conditions in Italy–
I was there. Were you?
- Oh, I should have gone myself, I know.
- All right, all right.
You don't like it, I'll turn it over to D.C. Augur... now that he's safely back in the publishing business.
Who said I didn't like it?
We'll run it as a series.
The usual rates.
Are you two gonna sit here all night arguing?
It's this pigheaded husband of yours, Norah.
- He has no respect for my gray hairs.
- He's getting an Augur complex.
- Don't you want a nightcap, Bill?
- No. I'm going to bed.
- Good night, Taedy.
- Good night, Mr. Fitz.
Come on, honey. Taedy, just leave that bottle on the table there.
I had no intention of touching it,
I can assure you.
You first.
- Good night, Bill.
- Good night, Bill.
- Good night.
- If you want anything, just sing out.
- Thanks. I want a wife like Norah.
- There aren't any.
If he gets altogether unmanageable,
I'll remember that.
Bill!
What's the idea?
Oh.
Oh, it's you.
- What were you doing with the bottle?
- Shh! Shh-shh!
It's for an old friend of mine, just in case he needs something to keep out the cold, you know.
He–
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.

Well I'll be darned!
 Does this means that I am getting decrepit?
No! I tried to find a black snake creep for you
 but I had to take that instead.
When you are not shaking it over our heads
to make us work you can hover around and letting enjoy your sciatica
Come on boys! Do me a favor and clear up this mess. I hate the VanR. to know that
I live with a couple of heathens who work on Christmas Eve 
-That is right, I forgot they were coming. 
-The VanR. are coming here?
Yes. I was lucky to get them too. They are fascinating people. The world is ours
They can give us all the latest News about India Chad.
So, come on. We better be getting dressed.
Joseph, see that the living room gets cleared up and mix the Tom and Jerries. 
-Yes Mr. O'Brian.
It is a lot of Chadwick's nonsenses
Discussing the menu 
And there will be Brandy? Of course!
...Brandy for Major Chadwick
Joseph, Remember tha last Christmas in
Saint Petersburg? Just before the war?
 -Yes excellency.
Here Joseph, Have this present from me.
Thank you very much your Excellency
The Order of Saint Stanislaus for me?
You were a great friend, to follow me to here Joseph,
It was no longer my option with out you there. 
Thank you your Excellency!
Joseph when I had jewels... and lands and palaces I was often weary and discontent
When everything was taken away except my life
I learned that the way to be
 really happy is to serve others.
To be needed so don't be sorry for me or for what was lost
Come the guests will be here and nothing will be ready.
Right on time! 
-Here Mr. O'Brian. 
-WIll you please fix me my tie
You know? I am all thumbs when it comes to tying a proper bow
And the table... All looks Magnificent.. Thank you!
Sure it is magic how you do it.
Yes, It really seems like Christmas in those days
What we should have George?
It is a troop of grandchildren... 
Yeah!...
Blowing horns and beating drums
 all over the place is not for me.
Well I guess is Merry Christmas to you. 
-Merry Christmas -Merry Christmas
Good evening gentlemen! 
-Khristos voskres!
 -That is for Easter!
Oh Chistmas also it is. Well Marry Christmas then. 
You are looking very pretty Madam Tanya
Thank you Major Chadwick. 
-And here is your present.
-Such a big feast!
What does this package be?
I think I'll have to seat down.
Well we kind of wanted to surprise you but we didn't think we'd knock you down
George, get her out to see her, with her coat.
Now now, lets us tried it out, and see your looks.
It is beautiful!
But it will keep me no warmer than your kindness gesture.
All this years...
"Za vashe zdorovie" (Cheers in Russian) 
And don't tell me it doesn't meant: TO YOUR HEALTH!
It does: "Za vashe zdorovie" and Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
 Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
And don´t you sigh at the count and have 
 a stay at your room. You're seating at the table
I'll be there!
And now I must be looking after things, the guests are very distinguished,
And as the hostess, I must see that every thing is perfect.
A telegram Sir.
What is wrong now?
The VanRippers, they can't come.
Oh, that is odd at the last moment.
Can't be helped. Illness in the family.
Illness in the family?...
You shouldn't have let them know I'd be here
Don't be ridiculous George.
You had nothing to do with it.
Didn't I?
Oh I can hear them...
George felled Melton
Isn't he the fellow that was mixed up in the sweep case?
Acquitted? Lack of evidence?
Oh for pity's sake George, don't be so sensitive.
That is all past and forgotten.
Sure it is and don't flatter your self that anybody remembers...
To tell you the truth I am relieved that 
 the VanRippers are not coming.
He is telling the same jokes that he told 20 years ago
And she dyes her hair. I think is a "shrimp pink" now.
I don't know why I asked them to come at all, at all.
The trouble with us is that we are in a rut, to much work and no play.
We don't take time to see our old friends.
Yes... not so many of our friends left Michel...
Well then we ought to make new ones...
What we ought to do is...
What we ought to do is...
Oh, Come on. 
Have a drink...
Confusing to our critics and to us,
 Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!
Oh there must be some lonely souls out in that crowd.
You are a sentimentalist...
Oh! I have and idea Chad!
Get off your cards gentlemen!
What you are up to now?
This is some of the gifts wallets that we've 
 left over with $10 dollars in each of them
Put the cards in them, and throw them by the window and we may have them back with somebody to have diner with
What? Strangers? Out of the street?
Oh there are no strangers on Christmas Eve,
Besides is better than seating around and hooting at each other like three old lauds in a bar.
What if none of them comes back?
I´ll take you up on that.
Dinner at P.S: for all of us, and the looser pays.
You heard Chad. It´s a bet.
That is alright I can't loose.
How long do we wait?
Win or loose. We dine at 7:00
Saint Anthony, send us back an honest soul.
With a neck tie.
Mine goes first!
It is gone!
Your turn Chad.
I can't see without my glasses.
Alright you're next George.
Come on. Come on! Let it go!
All right I doubt if we find it some body worth feeding,
But if gets unbearable we can run along to the club and we´ll have some Bridge.
Don't worry. Nobody will come back with them.
You are a man of very little faith George.
Come away from the window before you break the charm.
Well... Finder's keepers. Any money in it?
$10.00 Dollar bill. George Veil Melton
...engraved by Tiffany
He'll never miss the money...
Here you are Robin, Merry Christmas! 
-Thank you Madam.
You have a heart of gold! 
With other people's money!
I tell you England's territorial expansion
 has a quite a different significance.
No matter how thin your sliced, a grab is a grab.
Well! Off! The suspicious Cat.
England carried civilization into the wilderness...
What was Australia before she redeemed it from the aborigines
She made it a thriving territory a ranking continent
For her own special benefit of course...
It was for the benefit of the whole world 
 for the benefit of Australian it self
The proof is that there isn't an acre of the Empire
 that it isn't proud to fly the British flag
And furthermore let me tell... Oh Will you stop that noise?
Nice is it? What do you two think you are making?
The next thing you'll be digging trenches on your own
Yes! but I vow to refuse his unenlightened bias
Bias my foot!
He always takes the other side of the argument to get your goat
Well... It looks like you pay for the diner O'Brian.
Maybe I do...
And then again, maybe I don't.
Oh, Good evening to you!
Good evening Sir.
Somebody here loose a wallet?
Yes! Yes! Come in. Come in. Which one did you find... 
I mean, my name is O'Brian.
That is the name Alright!
 And ten dollars in it.
Ten dollars it is?
Here you are sir.
Well...
Merry Christmas! 
-Wait! Wait!...
Stay and have a good cheer with us
Well I... 
-Oh come along, come along...
What is your name lad?
James Houston, Sir.
Houston?
That is mighty nice of you...
Oh is awfully nice of you too
Sir...
-I mean to bring back... to bring back your wallet
Come along. Come along.
Mr. Melton, Mr. Chadwick, Here is Mr. Houston.
Good evening. Proud to know you Sir.
Mr. Houston brought back my wallet.
And now he is going to have a drink with us.
What will you have lad?
Oh, whatever you are having Sir.
I am having a Tom and Jerry myself.
How about you Chad?
Just a spot...
And you George?
No thanks I have a work Chad, when I´m back...
It really feels like Christmas Eve in here.
It is quite a nice spot.
I´ll have to place another log
Let me do that Sir.
There is nothing like an open fire.
We always have them down home
Are you from the West?
Texas Sir.
I'am from Oklahoma myself...
Oklaho...
Well I declare...
Howdy Neighbor!
Is this fire warm? Is it?
Here, seat down!
Thank you Sir.
Here. 
-Thank you Michael.
-Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Been up here long?
Since September...
...I came up with the Rodeo to Madison Square Garden.
I had to stay around and look at the town over.
Stayed a little too long I guess.
Now I am looking for a stake to get back to Texas.
Who knew it? Were you going some place? Diner perhaps?
No.
No Sir. No place in particular. Just walking around.
I've never been away from home for Christmas before...
Well so long as you are not going anywhere,
 Why not have diner with us?
Now, that is right kind of you Sir but I don't know
Well, after all likely is not inducing for a young fellow
 to dine with 3 old fogies like us you know?
Well, now...
If you put it that way, I...
I can't very well refuse...
Major Chadwick, this young lady says she found you a wallet
Oh. Oh yes of course.
Of course!
Good evening!
Oh, good evening.
Are you Mr. Chadwick?
Oh yes.
I believe is customary to describe lost articles.
Oh yes, that is right, of course.
Of course.
Well there is a sort of a wallet...
A square wallet
With my card inside
Any money?
Of course... ah...
Oh yes ten dollars.
Here you are.
Oh, yes, thank you.
Thank you very much
You are very welcome
Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Don´t go!
Come over to the fire! It is cold outside!
Get a Tom and Jerry to the young lady George!
It will warm you up!
Oh you didn't.. 
-What is your name?
Jean Lawrence.
My name is James Houston Mam!
How do you do Mr. Houston.
That is Mr. Houston, Miss Lawrence.
Put those two places back,
I believe Mr. O'Brian will have guests for diner after all
Yes. Excellency.
The last time I had a Tom and Jerry was back home in New Hampshire
New Hampshire?
Then you are not spending Christmas Eve with your family.
No, I was just going out to the movies.
Why don't you stay and have diner with us?
Oh, thank you very much but I couldn't...
Why not?
Have you had diner?
No. but I had a late lunch and I---
Diner is served!
That settles it.
Come along.
We will not take a no for an answer.
Come along.
Now it is all fine.
 It is a little game that we are playing.
I´ll tell you all about it.
You see, there were three of us here and we made a bet.
And... One of us lost.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure, wealth or rank possessing, ye who now will bless the poor shall yourselves find blessing
Hey Boy! You can sing!
Hey Hey, Come up!
We want some music up here.
I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair,
Borne like a vapor on the summer air
I see her tripping where the bright streams play
Happy as the daisies that dance on her way.
Many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour,
Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er
I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair
Floating like a vapor on the soft, summer air.
Right boy, has a grand voice. He is a real singer.
No is not so much
I used to sing a bit down at the ranch come on, let's all sing!
That is a good idea.
Joseph, Alponse, Katherine, I´ll find some, come here we are all going to sing
Sure, come on, How about Jingle Bells?
Jingle Bells!...
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh.
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way. 
 Oh! what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh.
In Russian: [ Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way. ]
In Russian: [ Oh! what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh. ]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh.
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh.
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh.
I can asure you you make me feel like I was 22 again
I like it the way you are.
Don't forget we have a date tomorrow.

 I used to live on one practically.

We had hope...

Then you...?
I will never see them again.
Somehow...
 I knew.
Gentlemen... If you are here...
What? Excellency?
Keep the tobacco jar filled Joseph.
And bring the hot towels as you usually do
I know you are here
I can't see you or touch you
But I know, you came home...
She didn't see us.
I remember now.
We were fine.
It was a storm.
The mountain. 
We crashed.
You heard me?
 Everything went black for a moment...
Then... we were here...
I seem to feel alright...
How are you Chad?
Splendid!
Light as air...
My glasses...
They are gone.
I don't seem to need them.
So this is it...
Sure is no more than walk from one room into the other. (Henry Scott Holland´s poem: 'Death is nothing)
How is your back?
Oh, ho ho ho! Look at him!
And my feet don't hurt. 
And I can see right through you George.
You always could...
And now, Do you believe in the immortal spirit of man?
It is just the habit of being here 
 that brought us back for a while.
For a while...
And then... What?
You are not afraid Chad... 
 - No...
Only curious as to What comes next...?
We'll find that out when the time comes.
Oh... Are we still in partnership?
Looks like we are out of business.
Yes. And good riddance too.
Oh Jim, Don't be ridiculous. 
You can't have three best-men.
Who says that? 
 Why can't I have three best-men?
Joseph:
Do you see Why can't I have three best-men...
What is the matter Joseph?
You have not heard?
Jimmy!
It can't be, Jimmy.
It can't be.
Here is Madam Tanya,
Madam Tanya!
They loved you both.
Very much.
They were good to us.
They were our friends.
They brought us together.
We came to tell them.
For June...
Jeanie.
Ah poor kids. They came to tell us their good news.
Strange seeing it from this side.
There is no pain for us.
Except their grief
Everything seems fading.
Far away.
Except for loving people.
Madam Tanya.
Madam Tanya...
In the library.
Yes.
What is going on?
Just a couple of hundreds.
...enough to get married on.
You shouldn't have done it.
Money is bad for kids.
Don't forget you still owe us a diner 
 from the last time you were wrong.
Dear Jimmy and Jeanie,
Accept this gift for the happy day.
I can see for your eyes is not far out
You have our blessing.
Just like them, to do this, for a couple of strangers...
You are not strangers.
You filled a very lonely place in his heart.
But... Won't you need this?
No Jimmy, thank you.
I am well provided for.
Is there anything I can do?
Perhaps Jimmy...
You could come and live here for a while.
So Joseph and I would have someone to look up.
Oh I´ll be glad to Madam.
Go now. You have a wedding to talk over.
I could swear I could see them up there.
So could I.
I beg your pardon, 
Are you related to the men who lived here?
We were their friends.
Could you give me some idea How they were like...
The report is that they were eccentric all over.
That is not true
I should say not. They were swell.
Well I am on the Daily Press. 
 My people wants human interest.
Won't you come along and talk it over?
This is station W.R.C. 
 National network. New York City.
You just heard the last news from the W.R.C. tower
Time is fifteen minutes after...
Do you want me?
Here is a story for the next week personalities 
 on the news forum.
I´ll get those kids.
Will you and Miss Lawrence kindly call at my office... regarding your appearance as guests regarding your appearance as guests
...on our news broadcasting
I think we should better Madam Tanya don't you?
Jim...
They may give you a chance to sing
I know you needed the chance.
That is right Jimmy.
Opportunities don't come every day.
What about Jeanie?
It says in the telegram that they want her too.
Oh I couldn't 
I´d be too scared.
Go ahead and see what they say.
Darling, if they let you sing, I know you'd be a hit.
You'll be famous. We´ll be rich. You´ll have a ranch with a million horses.
And Madam Tanya can come and live with us.
Yeah. We can all live happily ever after.
I still say be better of back in Texas, in the ranch, where he belongs.
Well, I agree with Michael.
The boy have talent.
Why shouldn't he do something with his voice?
Sure. Why not?
What is wrong with him being a singer?
The world needs music just as much it does buildings and bridges.
Alright. Have it your way.
But I am not in favor of it.
My name is James Houston and I received this telegram from Mr. Bert.
I'll tel him your are here.
Thank you.
Mr. Bert.
Mr. Houston is here.
Mr. Houston, you can go right in
Thank you very much.
Oh I am...
Are you going to pick it up
I sure hope I didn't do any damage, Miss Terry.
Oh that is alright.
Where have I seen you before?
Oh, probably in the paper.
 - hum - hummm...
Well? Texas?
Are you going to sing on the air?
I hope so...
Well let me know when you go on...
I'd like to hear you.
My telephone number is on there.
Good luck!
Thank you Mam!
Where can I phone?
Right here, use this.
Thank you,
Oh Jimmy, really?
Yes. They are going to put me on the broadcast tonight.
Yeah, I am going to sing.
Oh Darling, I know you´ll be good.
Would you call Madam Tanya and tell her?
I've got to go practice
I mean, rehearse.
Yeah, I'll come by and pick you after is over.
We'll go celebrate.
Bye honey!
I'll be singing to you.
Bye, and Good luck! Darling.
Rachel,
...he is going to sing.
Here?
Not here.
I mean Jimmy
He'll sing tonight at 7:30
W.R.C.
I got to tell all the nurses.
Is my wife here?
Only if she is a 9 year old. This is a children hospital.
Hello Mom...
Mom, I...
Yeah.
Mom?
Why I call you for is a surprise...
Yeah. I want you to tune in WRC at 7:30 p.m. N. Y. time tonight.
Yeah.
What?
Oh no, Mom I don't need them.
Oh but mom is not cold enough for them.
But mom, people don't wear them in N.Y.
Yeah.
Now, don't forget mom. 7:30 tonight.
Yeah.
Good bye mom.
Thank you.
Ah, You mind?
No. It is quite alright.
Miss. Terry's apartment...
Who is calling?
No she isn't in right now.
I don't know when she'll be back.
I´ll tell her you called Mr. Houston.
Hello...
Hello, Miss Terry.
This is Jimmy Houston.
Yeah. I met you at the radio station, You remember?
Well I am calling you like you said because I will be on air at 7:30
You are?
Yes. Singing.
Oh you must be swell because Bart is tough.
Thanks for letting me know.
Good bye Mr. Houston.
That was pretty good.
Pretty good? Is a hit!
We can go to a fast rehearsal just as soon as 
 Tommy Marshall returns from Florida.
Oh, poor old Tommy.
He´ll be making his entrances in a wheelchair pretty soon
Don't worry, he has his face lifted, besides he still brings them in.
What about some diner? Oh is quarter to eight... quarter to eight?
Wait a minute, there is something I wanted to hear and I missed it.
So why should we run? let's get drenched in moonbeams.
The blossoms of romance need showers to start
Don´t shelter your heart. It is raining dreams.
I heard the thunder crash the moment we kissed
And now that we kissed, it is raining dreams.
I saw the lighting flash and light up the skies.
Or was it your eyes? It is raining dreams.
We are caught in a moon shower with no place to run
So why should we run? let's get drenched in moonlight. The blossoms of romance need showers to start.
Don´t shelter your heart.
It is raining dreams.
That was worse than heading off a stampede
How was I?
Alright.
Here I come,
Hello.
Oh yes, Miss Terry.
Yes.
He is here.
You are doing fine.
Hello.
Thank you.
Well is nice of you to say so.
Oh I mean it. Really.
Oh just a minute, my producer, 
Phil Hubert wants to talk to you.
Hello Mr. Houston.
Yes, this is Phil Hubert.
Well, you are very good.
Thank you very much.
Well I be glad to, sir.
Yes I have the address, I'll be up there directly.
Good bye.
Well, he can go very far on with a voice like that.
I see we can build him up in the radio and then 
 I get Kelly busy with publicity.
And if he looks like you say he does, 
I think maybe we've got something.
I think we've... Got something...
Jimmy, darling.
You are marvelous.
Oh thanks honey, but you don't know the half of it, I am on my way to see a fellow about my singing
Yeah, I just came by to tell you
 I can't stay I'll go right away
Good bye. I'll phone you latter.
Good bye.
I´ll be waiting.
Well hello.
 - Good evening Mam.
This is Mr. Hubert, Mr. Houston-
I am proud to meet you sir.
 - Hello.
Congratulations, you stop the show!
Oh no mam, I reckon it was fixed to stop, I came out at the end.
Well, How do you like the applause?
Fine sir. I figure that half was good manners and the rest was on the station pay roll
Is a crime to spoil modesty like that.
 Boy you are a natural.
Miss. Terry and I are going over the book about the new show.
Our leading man is beginning to creak a little. 
We thought perhaps you may fit into our plans.
Well I declare... You...
You mean on the stage sir?
Yes.
Oh no I don't think that I...
Oh come on... have a drink.
Have something to eat let get better acquainted.
I feel lucky tonight!
To success.
Hello-
I am sorry Dr. Brown is on day duty.
Sweet Louise My Lady...
Just about my success. 
I am going to sing in a show. lovely music...
Yes sir. You've better go to bed. It is after three.
I am alright Joseph. I am alright.
Good night Joseph. 
 - Good night!
Oh well Why not? Who wouldn't celebrate?
He is getting his chance...
Yeah, he has to get mixed up with a lot of cheap people, turn his head and make a full of him.
He'll drink too much and will laugh too much
 and will loose his way.
There are two sides to it George.
The way I see it, he will give people a lot of pleasure.
Ah, he is a good lad...
...and he is in love with a fine girl. She will keep him steady.
To be born innocent is natural, but to die pure of hart,
...that is a gift.
We´ll stick to your faith Michael.
You may need it before you are through
Ah you are always looking at the black side of things.
George Melton
George Melton
George, no matter what you did. If you're sorry for it, 
 no power of darkness can touch you
I you only say your are sorry, George.
That I didn't need it.
I have no remorse...
I never did have..
I´d be a hypocrite, to say I am sorry now...
Come in...
I haven't been in so very many nice things in my life.
My parents were divorce. I was on the stage when I was fourteen.
Then a bad marriage.
A tough struggle
Success and applause isn't everything Jimmy
Seat down Jimmy.
Some times I get home sick too for some one of my own.
Some one who really loves me,
The way a woman wants to be loved.
Oh she is a smooth one.
Smooth as silk, that one is.
Every move...
Every word is figured...
I want some one who really loves me 
 the way a woman wants to be loved...
And him, taking it hook, line, and sinker.
(As it if all was true)
Oh, I've made a lot of mess here
You´ve got to help me Chad. 
You've got to help me bring the boy back.
Chad...
I heard something...
Do you hear something? It is happening right along...
Is the old bugle call...
cavalry trumpet call 
The last post...
cavalry trumpet call 
It is for me Michael...
Dad! dad.
David!
Dad!
David!
David!
This is my boy Michael.
My boy David.
I though I'd never see you again.
We all think that. I've come for you dad.
Where now? What seems like?
What do you want it to be like?
I remember the old army post in signal
Without the rings, of course...
Ah we were happy there. Great country.
Splendid regiment!
Good horses.
Good sports.
Kin men...
Then that's it. Every man gets his dream.
Lets go. 
Mother is waiting.
My Lyn...
Good luck Michael.
Good bye Allen!
Not Good bye, old fellow.
We'll be seeing you.
Won't be David? 
 - That is right dad!
Good luck Michael!
Good luck!
Ah... Don't cry Jeanie.
Don't cry darling. That does no good.
Take your Irish UP!
You are prettier than she is. And sweeter too.
And younger...
Are you going to seat back and let her win over?
Not if you are the girl I think you are.
Sure if he is worth of loving a doll, he is worth to be fighting for.
Now, go to him...
...and when he sees you, his love will remember...
Put on your pretty things and go to him.
Go now, Jeanie girl.
And good luck!
Good luck!
Some times I get homesick for the prairie
The stars, the quiet...
The sound of a dog barking way off of the distance.
Say, Do you like horses?
My father used to practically live at the tracks
Have it with them a luck
Before I was ten I knew every racing horse in the country by its first name
No fooling...
Say,
You know? You are a pretty wonderful girl.
Am I?
I am just a hick guy.
I just don't know why you've been so nice to me?
I think a lot of you.
But you know that. Don't you?
Don't answer!
Darling!
My ex husband. Why is he here for?
Darling!
Take me in.
No. You better go out the back way.
I can't sneak out...
We don't want a rub, unpleasant things have a way in getting into the papers
Think of the show...
But I can't leave you here with him.
Please.
You, you're sure you'll be alright?
Oh Jim...
Let's go away for a few days to the country
I need a rest and you do too. We are always up for rehearsal.
Wow... What about Mr. Hubert?
Oh I'll talk to him and he will make arrangements. 
 you go home and pack your bags
And I'll telephone you when I am ready to leave.
Open the door!
I thought so.
You are Houston. Aren't you?
That is right.
Ah, you don't look like you been sneaking out of back doors for long
She doesn't want to see you.
Get going!
O.K.
You'll find out.
Hello Jimmy.
Hello Jeanie.
I was worried about you.
I just wanted to make sure you are alright.
Oh. I am fine.
Been awful busy...
I wanted to talk to you but it seem...
...like I haven't had a minute.
You are looking mighty fine Jeanie.
You are looking well too.
I am sorry about not seeing you Jeanie.
I understand.
Oh Jimmy, I am so glad about your success.
It is just what I wanted for you.
Thanks.
Every thing happened so suddenly Jeanie
Maybe later on, when things quiet down, and start to get my breath I...
I guess I better go now.
Good bye Jim.
Good luck!
Jimmy if things just do go wrong, or people don't treat you right, or get sick or something, don't...
Don't forget we are friends. Let me know what you need... Won't you?
You fool. Go after her. Don't let her get away Jimmy.
Hello!
Oh hello!
I talked to Hubert.
Every thing is all set we can stay in till Tuesday
 isn't that wonderful?
That gives us three days...
I´ll pick you up in about twenty minutes, Will you be ready?
You bet I will
Bye!
If there is anything important you can reach me at the Pinewood inn but I mean important.
If you don't stop annoying me I´ll have you put away where you belong
Arlene, I've been trying to see you to tell you I have a chance to come back.
Milton´s got a show
He is...
He is going to give me the lead if I can come on my feet again
And...
Well, I can't do it alone.
Milton is going to give you a lead?
 - Yes.
What are you trying to do? Get me? Look at you!
I knew you wouldn't care.
I know there is someone else now.
There's always been someone elese...
But no one loves you the way I do.
Arlene...
Arlene...
 -Alright, take your hands off me.
But Arlene... Please!
Madam Tanya. I am worried about Jimmy.
It is not right for him to go with this Terry woman. 
 No good will come by...
No good will come of it. Nothing but trouble...
Do everything you can to stop it.
There she is now.
I am Arlene Terry. Is Mr. Houston ready?
I should see.
It's alright Madam Tanya
Jimmy, please don't go.
What is the matter. You look worried.
I am. That girl..
Lots of stories on the paper
That is nothing but publicity. It don't mean anything.
Jimmy. A man can spoil his life over a woman.
I know our friends wouldn't like you to go away with that girl.
Hum... She is fine. She...
She gave me a part in her show.
And we both want to get away to the country for a few days before rehearses again
Jimmy, Mr. Melton lost everything: Home, family, reputation,
Over such a woman...
Oh now you are making sound more serious that it really is.
Don't you worry. I'll be alright.
I´ll be back by Tuesday.
Good bye.
Well Who is that?
Just the luggage.
What is the matter? You seem nervous.
I do? Say: Do you?
Do you believe in hunches?
Some times Why?
I got a funny feeling we are going on the wrong direction.
On the trail when I feel like that I usually turn back.
Oh I can see you were cut out for the stage Jimmy, 
 superstitions and everything.
There are superstitions on the stage...?
Heavens, yes. Hundreds of them!
Madam Tanya is the one who usually has hunches and she is usually never wrong.
Is she the disagreeable old lady that answered the door?
Well she is not disagreeable, she has just been through alot
You know? I don't think I should have run off and left her the way I did.
Oh nonsense, Jimmy.
You shouldn't be living in that rusty old house with those rusty old servants
You should have an apartment of your own where you could do as you please
I'll find you one.
Am I wind to much for you?
Snuggle down.
Oh you are so nice me Jim.
Maybe you wont think that, after you know me better.
Why not?
Oh I got a lot of old fashioned bag woods
Oh we'll soon get rid of those.
We'll have a lovely time in Pinewood
We´ll walk and ride horse back and roast chestnuts by the fire no crowds, no autograph hounds
There is not to many people this time a year.
I´ll have you all to myself.
How fat to Pinewood Inn?
About five miles.
Where can I get something to drink?
Right around the corner.
Sum it up!
I'll be right back.
Yes.
Feeling any better?
A little.
I don't know what is wrong with me either
I feel sort of strange
Oh come up, cheer up. We are on a holiday!
Diner is ready to serve Miss Terry.
Good!
Food is what you need and plenty of it.
Michael
Michael O'Brian
I am here.
It is time Michael.
Right now?
Yes.
Now!
I can't go now.
We call ONLY ONCE.
But I can't leave Jimmy.
He needs me.
There is trouble coming,
I got him into this.
I must get him out.
It means you'll linger in the shadows of earth...
For all time.
I can't go now.
I can't
SO BE IT, MICHAEL!
It gives me great pleasure to announce:
That we have with us this evening TWO
Two very distinguished Broadway personalities:
Miss Arlene Terry and Mr. James Houston.
You just got to take a bow
Come on. It´ll be good for the show.
If we try hard, we are making Mr. Houston to give us a song.
Jimmy, Jimmy.
Jimmy!
Call fast for an ambulance. Quick!
Sponge!
... Let's try and suture one chance...
Take his blood pressure nurse.
Jimmy.
Mr. O'Brian.
Oh Jimmy Why didn't you listen? I tried to warn you.
Jeanie...
Oh Jeanie...
She shouldn't cry like that for me.
She loves you Jimmy
What ever happened to me anyway?
You were too young and thoughtless...
Success came too suddenly.
And that woman...
She's...
She is gone?
She had no soul at all to go on
Jeanie.
I am sorry.
If I could have only tell her.
We make mistakes some times that can never be remedied.
It's my self I am blaming Jimmy.
Not you.
Michael,
Michael O'Brian
You came back
Your mother would give us no peace.
Until we came back for you.
If it isn't asking too much could you do me a favor before we go?
Could you give the boy another chance?
He is a good lad.
And he's learned his lesson.
Give him a chance will you?
So be it!
Let him go back.
Come along O´Brian
You are the stubbornest soul we've ever loved
Michael!
George!
George, I am glad to see you!
What happened? How did you get here?
I've come a long way out of darkness.
Darkness is a terrible thing Michael.
I thought of you and Chad...
Your face and loyalty and friendship
And then the bitterness began getting out of my heart.
I saw a light.
And I followed it, and it brought me here.
Some times we have to go to the darkness alone before we can see the light.
There is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents
(Luke 15:7)
M i c h a e l !
Michael!
 - It is my mother.
She's beautiful, isn't she? Lucky man, Tom Danbury.
If his sense of lovemaking equals his sense of politics, it should be a happy marriage.
Who couldn't be happy with
Melody Allen? She's adorable.
Oh, Cuthbert. Uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Do you recommend this vintage, my man?
Oh, yes, it's delicious.
That is, so the other guests have told me.
So, Master Cuthbert. Up to your old tricks again, I see.
Oh, Nora, just a nip or two.
But I'd even give that up if... I know. If I'd marry you.
You could become the biggest teetotaler in the
Colonies, and my answer would still be no.
But, Nora, I have saved up enough money to pay your bond to Master Danbury.
Why, you'd be a free woman.
No, thank you.
I'd rather be bound to the master than tied to the likes of you. So!
You're still in love with that little, fat, stupid tinker.
Little he may be. Fat? There's nothin' wrong with an extra pound of flesh.
But stupid? Hmph! You'll never see the day when you're half as smart as my Horatio.
I'll say he's smart... persuading you to punch holes in all the master's best copperware.
'Tis a lie.
That was my own idea.
Nora! Nora!
He's comin' up the road!
Who?
Horatio, my darlin'?
That lazy fat tub.
Lazy, is he?
Why, he's the most wide-awake tinker in the Colonies.
Hello, tinker.
Hello, Mr. Grant.
Hello, Mrs. Jones.
Horatio!
Horatio, my darlin'!
Oh!
Lancelot!
Ahh-choo!
Wahh-choo!
Horatio.
Horatio?
Horatio, where are you?
Nora! Nora!
Saints preserve us.
Oh, Nora.
I had a terrible time getting here. I got lost east of West Point, and I was held up north of South Ferry.
And at Barton's Barn, I had a
"bitish" with the "Buttish. " A what?
A British with a brish... A brush with the British. And I was shot.
Where?
Right through the saddle.
The devils.
Nora.
I'd never go through that again for anyone... except you.
Ooh.
Ohh!
Ohh.
N-Nora!
Oh, Horatio, do my kisses thrill you that much?
I'm sitting on a pitchfork.
Oh! Oh, well, for heaven's sake!
Here, here. Well, get up! Nora! Nora!
Get it ou-ou-out!
Nora!
Nora!
Nora! Nor...!
Ooh-ooh.
Food. Nora, for me? Mm-hmm.
Thank you. Tinker, I've missed you so much.
I've missed you too, Nora.
Here. You take the first bite. It'll taste sweeter.
Okay.
Oh, Horatio, 'tis happy I am to see you. Cuthbert's been pesterin' me again.
Oh, he has, has he?
Wait'll I see him.
I'll haul off and give him the dirtiest look he's ever had in his life.
No need of that since we'll be leavin' here tomorrow.
Why so hasty?
Hasty, is it?
Tinker! You've not got the money.
Well, you see, Nora, things are very hard, and folks can't pay me.
When I first started the trip, I had a pound, 14 shillings and six pence.
Then I found that a lot of my customers were badly off.
So I bought them food with my pound and 14 shillings.
What happened to your pence?
I lost 'em in a card game.
Oh, Horatio, you've failed me.
Oh, Nora.
Don't worry. I'll get the money. Business is gonna boom... now that I got a personal letter of recommendation from General
George Washington.
From the general himself?
Yes, I have.
You wouldn't be after tellin' a tale now? Oh, no, Nora.
I got it right here. It isn't everyone that can get a letter from General
George Washington.
"Know all men by these presents...
Mm-hmm.
"That the bearer of this letter, Master Horatio Prim,
That's me.
"Is a splendid artisan...
"whose very skills have served the Continental forces well.
"I take great pleasure in recommending him...
"to all who need the services of an excellent tinker and a true patriot.
"Yours truly, George Washington,
Commander-in-chief of the United Colonies."
Oh, Horatio, now there's nothin' to stop us.
Let me take this to Mistress Melody.
When she learns you've been praised by General
Washington, she'll help us elope... tonight.
Stay here, my darlin' tinker.
I'll be back soon with good news.
Hmm-mmm!
Nora and I are gonna elope.
We're gonna get married.
And why not?
Yes, why not?
I'm a very good friend of
General George Washington's.
Mmm.
Whoo-ooh
Mice.
Good evening to you, Master Tinker.
I don't want any trouble with you like I had the last time.
I only came to congratulate you.
Congratulate me? Well, yes. Nora's told me all about you and she eloping.
I think it's splendid.
You do? I thought that, that y-you...
Yes, yes, yes, I know. It's just a case of the best man winning.
Oh. Odsbodkins! You're not such a bad fellow after all.
Now, Horatio, I know that eloping with Nora means breaking her bond.
But I think there's something that you can do... There is?
That would put you in well with Master Danbury.
What, for instance?
Well, now, this trunk he wanted to take on his honeymoon.
He was terribly upset when he found out he'd lost the key.
Now if you could open the trunk,
I could put you in very good.
Well, I could try.
Ah, now don't be so modest.
I know all about that letter from
George Washington. George Washington.
Yes. Uh-huh. I'll open it.
Watch this.
Fine. Now, uh, raise the lid.
No, no, the lid of the trunk. Oh.
ByJupiter, I do believe there's a hole in the bottom. There's a hole in there?
Ooh! Ooh-ooh! M-M-My foot! I'm sorry.
Horatio, go in there and see if it can be repaired, eh, old boy?
Are you sure this'll get me in good? Oh, I'll see to that.
Let me outta here.! So you were going to elope with Nora O'Leary tonight, eh?
Well, we shall see what happens when Master Danbury finds out... that you've talked an innocent little girl into breaking her bonds.
Nora! You'll get yours. You'll get five years in prison at hard labor.
You penniless stinker.
Melody, darling, I'll have another surprise for you after we're married.
Oh, but, Tom, you've already promised me the moon.
What else might a lady expect?
How would you fancy a title, my dear?
A title? Lady Danbury, for instance.
How does it sound to those lovely ears?
Sir Thomas and Lady Danbury.
But, Tom, after the war, there'll be no titles... in our United States.
But, my angel, what if after the war, there should be no United States?
What are you talking about?
Melody, darling, would you mind going in by yourself?
I'll join you shortly. Of course,
Tom, but all this strange talk... this nonsense about titles.
What does it all mean? Please, dear, I'll explain later.
Cranwell.
Hello, Tom.
Hello, Tom. Leigh. Glad you're here.
Bessie. Bessie!
Let go. I'll keep her from tinkering with that tinker.
So she was going to elope, eh? I'll tend to that.
Go back in the kitchen.
Master Danbury, I must see you at once. Sorry, Cuthbert, not now.
But, sir, this is very important. Confound it. Get out.
Get out of here. But, Master Danbury, if you'll only let me explain.
Well, gentlemen? The news. Is it good or bad?
It's good. Very good. Major
Andre, the king's representative, met with Benedict Arnold last night.
Arnold has consented to surrender
West Point within 48 hours.
Excellent! It means the end of the war.
Washington and his rabble can never recover from such a blow.
Congratulations, Tom.
Your plan has worked perfectly.
Our friend Benedict has requested that you personally come to West Point... to help him arrange the final details tonight.
Hold on. I thought I saw something move.
"Yours truly, George Washington.
" Who is this Horatio Prim?
Where is he? I'll not be tellin' you that, even if you cut my tongue out.
We'll take care of him later. There's enough evidence in this letter... to hang your rebel friend when we've won the war.
Oh, Master Tom, you... a traitor! You spying little hussy.
Get rid of her. She's heard too much already.
Let go of me!
Nora.!
That Cuthbert.!
Oh, I hate that Cuthbert.!
Put your hands up.
Put your hands up!
Speak up, fellow. Who are you? Horatio Prim, the tinker.
Oh, Prim. You're Nora's sweetheart. Yes, ma'am.
Thank heavens. I need help.
What do you think I need?
Would you please get me out of this overcoat? Ooh, that Cuthbert.
I just learned that the
United Colonies and
General Washington are in great danger.
You and I have to save them. My friend General Washington in danger?
Yes, yes. That's all I gotta know. Get me outta here.
Do you know the location of the nearest
Continental Army post? Yes, ma'am.
Saddle those two horses while I finish dressing.
Whoa, Lancelot.
I'll be right with ya.
But, sir, when did they capture this spy, Major Andre? Early this morning.
We found some papers in his boot exposing the whole foul plot.
And some of them were signed by Master Thomas Danbury.
Master Prim, we must get through.
If anyone tries to stop us, we'll shoot. Here's a horse pistol.
This is for you. What do I shoot with? This is no time to jest.
We must go. Mistress Melody, I wanna tell Nora that we're goin'.
Nora and I plan to elope.
I don't want her to worry.
Oh, but, Nora...
She wa...
Oh, I'm sorry, tinker. I'm afraid there won't be time.
I'm sure Nora'll understand.
Hurry. I guess so.
Tinker, here come some of
Tom Danbury's friends.
The back road.
There go two of the traitors.
Lieutenant, surround the house! Yes, sir.
Neither one of these men is Tom Danbury.
They're dirty traitors just the same, else they wouldn't have been shooting at us.
What'll we do with them, sir?
Throw them in the well. That's the only burial they deserve.
Yes, sir.
Hear me, ye faithless souls.
May you lie there in everlasting torment... with but one name to identify your rotting bones:
"Traitors."
And unless some evidence proves us wrong,
I curse your miserable spirits... to be bound to Danbury Acres...
'til crack of doom.
Amen.
Here you are, Major.
Good.
G-G-G-G-Ghost.
Oh, no, it's me, tinker.
Odsbodkins and spotty widgeons!
Am I glad to see you, Mistress
Melody. Oh, am I happy now.
You know what I thought for a minute? Only a minute, mind you.
I thought you were a ghost.
Me, a ghost. I thought you were a ghost!
What did you do?
I didn't do anything.
My hand...
That's funny.
I'm still thirsty.
Tinker, there's something very, very wrong. You can say that again.
Look. "Here were buried two traitors."
Good! I wonder who they were.
Look at the date!
September 23, 1780.
That's today. That's right, tinker.
What's the matter?
That looks like us down there.
Yeah! How can us be down there when us are up here?
Do you remember when Master
Danbury's friends tried to stop us?
Yeah, and they even took shots at us. I'm afraid they killed us.
They killed us?
Why?
We didn't do anything.
Soldiers.
American soldiers.
A-And those people. It looks as if they were looting the place.
What does all this mean? There's just one answer, one terrible answer.
Those soldiers were pursuing us, and we mistook them for Tom Danbury's friends... and they mistook us for traitors.
Traitors? Me, a traitor? I'm a patriot!
I even got a letter from General
George Washington to prove it.
Uh-oh. I gave the letter to
Nora to give to you. Nora?
That must be the letter that Tom took from her before she was kidnapped.
Kidnapped? Kidnapped! Kidnapped?
Nora? Who are they?
Where are they?
I'll tear them gizzard from gullet!
Tinker!
Wait for me!
Come on, you old nag.
Get up. Get up.
Get up. Come on. Lancelot! Cuthbert!
Come back with my Lancelot.!
Lancelot.! Lancelot.!
What happened?
I don't know.
I can't get through.
Something's wrong. Wait.
"Hear me, ye faithless souls.
"May you lie there in everlasting torment...
"with but one name to identify your rotting bones:
'Traitor. "'
"And...
"unless some evidence proves us wrong,
"I curse your miserable spirits... to be bound to Danbury
Acres 'til crack of doom."
Then you heard it too. Oh, I thought it was some horrible dream, but it wasn't.
We're bound to these acres forevermore. We can't get away.
But he also said unless some evidence proves him wrong.
Evidence? My letter from George
Washington! That's evidence!
That's right. Tom must have hidden it somewhere in the library furniture.
Furniture? This is a fine time to think of furniture.
Mistress Melody, the patriots took it all away!
Well, don't give up.
Maybe he hid it behind some secret panel in the wall.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Great Beelzebub and little Beelzebub. Look!
Now we shall be here
'til doom cracks.
Mistress Melody, why didn't you get
Paul Revere to help you instead of me?
Oh, I'm sorry, tinker. It's all my fault. Forgive me?
I think we'd better go back to the well.
Do you mind?
Uh-uh.
This is the first time I've ever put my arm around you.
That's right. Melody. Yes?
We've been up in this tree for 165 years. Yes.
And never once did I...
What?
Never...
Melody.
Yes?
You have beautiful eyes.
Oh, my little tinker.
Melody, there's just one thing I want to ask you.
Oh, yes.
If I...
Oh, what is it?
Melody.
Yes?
No, I can't. It sounds foolish comin' from a fat man.
Oh, no, Horatio!
Tell me.
You really wanna hear it?
Yes.
Melody, would you...
Would I what?
Would you scratch my back tonight?
See, it didn't take so long.
That's right. And yet, no one would know we're anywhere near civilization.
Ain't that the truth. Here.
Careful now. Don't look yet.
I want you right back here.
Now!
There she stands.
Danbury Manor, exactly as it was in 1780.
Come on. I can hardly wait to show you the inside.
Shelly, this porch is a dream.
Should be. It was designed by the famous Jonathan Bullfinch in 1760.
Why, Shelly, you mean we have servants already? Why, absolutely.
The local employment agency sent us a housekeeper.
Hello, Emily.
Afternoon.
I'd like you to know my fiancée, Miss
Prescott, and her aunt, Mrs. Dean.
'Lo.
'Lo.
Decorators left last night.
Said to tell you... they got all the rooms fixed like it explains in the book.
Great! Hang on tight, darling.
We're going into the 18th century.
Oh, is this trip necessary?
Oh, uh, pardon me, but didn't I see you in Rebecca?
Hey, kids, wait for me.
Oh, Shelly!
You like it? Oh, darling, it's wonderful.
Don't you think so, Millie?
Oh, it's out of this world.
Don't know whether you realize it, Mildred, but this happens to be the very furniture... the Danbury family used
160-odd years ago.
Someday I'm gonna...
That must be Doc Greenway. I've invited him up for the weekend.
Oh, dear Dr. Greenway. That's all we need to complete the picture.
Ralph Greenway happens to be one of the best psychiatrists in New York.
I'd better go down and let him in.
Millie, please! I wish you'd stop making smart cracks.
You're beginning to upset Sheldon, and he's not entirely well yet.
Now Ralph said...
"Ralph said."
Last week he said the rash
I had wasn't an allergy.
It was caused by a guilt complex because I kicked your Grandma in the bustle when I was two years old.
I can hardly believe my eyes.
Absolutely miraculous.
Ralph!
It's good to see you. June.
Mildred. It's good to see you.
Nice to see you, Doctor.
Quite an accomplishment, eh? Quite.
Has Shelly told you I hit on the idea of restoring this particular place?
No, do tell us. Well, it's part of my family history. 160-some-odd years ago, my great-great-great grandfather, Cuthbert
Greenway, was a butler on this estate.
Really?
From butler to psychiatrist in six generations.
Now that's democracy for you.
Pardon, Mr. Gage. This was delivered this morning.
Oh, yes, a plaque for the well.
Look, honey. It's very impressive.
Strange. In all these years, no one ever discovered who those two traitors were.
Hope the ghosts don't throw this one over the fence too.
- Ghosts? Did you say ghosts?
- It's just a legend.
The ghosts are supposed to hurl their memorial stone over the fence every so often.
Yep. Last time was Fourth ofJuly.
Put Mayor Hathaway in the hospital for two weeks. Hit him in the head with it.
Interesting case, isn't it?
I think we'd better get this placed on the well before dinner.
I'll get some tools.
Let me go.! I'm gonna throw that plaque over the fence.
Oh, stop it, Horatio. What good would it do? They'll only put it back.
Then I'll throw it back over again.
I don't want all those people comin' up here and sayin':
Here lie the dirty traitors Here lie the dirty traitors Oh, pooh. I'm used to it.
Well, I'm not. Besides, it only happens once a year... when they have the Fourth ofJuly picnic.
But did you hear what that man said? Every Saturday, they're gonna open up the place to the public, between 2:00 and 4:00.
And I'm not gonna stand for it. But, darling, what can you do about it?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna make them sorry they ever rebuilt that house.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna haunt 'em.
That's what I'm gonna do. Hm-mmm
Horatio!
Horatio!
I always forget to do that. Well, you'd better forget the whole thing.
No self-respecting ghosts do any haunting until midnight.
Oh. All right.
I'll wait.
But tonight, I haunt.
Psst.!
Ooh!
Don't do that! You almost scared the life out of me.
Oh, I'm sorry, but I was lonely up at the tree, and I got frightened.
Please let me stay down here with you.
Well, all right, but don't try to stop me.
My mind is already made up.
Can't believe it.
It's exactly the same.
Let's go in. We can't.
Everything is locked.
If we wasn't a couple of outdoor ghosts, we'd know what to do.
Why don't we try to go in the same way as we go up and down the tree?
You know.
Here I go.
I don't think she made it.
Come on.
It's easy.
I'm stuck.!
Melody!
Ohh.
I didn't make it. Horatio, won't you ever learn?
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Thank you.
Why, it's amazing.
Horatio, look at this table.
A-And the sofa.
I'll light a candle.
How could they have known what it was like?
Don't work.
Glass around the wick.
Look.
What'd you do?
Well, blow it out.
B-B-Blow it out?
Go on.
You blow it out.
Uh-oh.
Why...
What an astonishing idea.
They probably got it from Ben
Franklin. He's always inventing things.
Be calm.
Be reasonable.
You see? There's nothing to be afraid of.
I've changed my mind. Let's go back to the well. Not yet, Horatio.
This is fun.
I'm scared.
Oh, really!
"Memoirs of
Thomas Danbury, Esquire. "
What?
Thomas Danbury's memoirs!
His grandmas?
"With a repentant heart,
I dedicate these memoirs...
"to my country and to Melody Allen, whose love I betrayed for vainglorious ambition."
Speakin' of the devil, there he is.
It's a perfect copy.
But he belongs in the library.
And we belong back in the tree.
Let's go.
Oh, don't be such a fraidy cat, Horatio.
This is the first pleasure
I've had since 1780.
The harpsichord!
It looks exactly the same.
Don't touch it. Something's liable to happen. Oh, nonsense.
Why don't you be like me? I'm sensible. I'm sensible too.
And I'm brave. I should've quit when I was even.
Why don't you pull yourself together and practice what you preach?
What was that?
Number, please.
Spooks!
What's the matter? That thing over there just talked to me.
You're just imagining things.
That note always did stick.
Shh!
Somebody's comin'.
Sheldon, is that you?
Quick.
Unmanifest.
For heaven's sake, hurry up.
Cuthbert! Melody, it's
Cuthbert, and he's still alive!
How can he be? I don't know.
They say only the good die young.
Odsbodkins!
I'm still showin'!
Melody, I don't think he can see me. Are you sure?
Take a look.
Watch.
See ifhe can hear you. Whistle.
Horatio, this is wonderful.
Have I got an idea!
What's the matter with me?
How do you like that, Master
Cuthbert? Ha-ha, ee-ee, zounds!
What well did she come out of? Melody!
Emily. Aren't you the playful one.
Emily. Emily!
Dr. Greenway. Did you hear it too? Hear what?
They're here. Somebody must have done something to offend them.
Offend who? Them. From the well. The ghosts.
Oh, nonsense.
There's no such a thing.
You hear 'em?
They're laughing.
No, no, no, no, no.
You'd hear 'em if you were psychic like me.
Emily, when you came in here, did you or did you not kick me?
Why, certainly not.
Uh-oh.
Oh, you felt something, eh?
Uh, uh, I-I...
I thought so.
It's you they're after.
No. You must have annoyed them playing that harpsichord.
Harpsichord!
Uh-oh.
Uh, Emily, if I were you, I-I wouldn't say anything to the folks about this.
They don't understand this psychic business like we do, you know.
They might think you're a little bit, uh... You understand.
Best you go up to bed.
Good night, Emily.
Good night.
Good night.
If you want me, all you gotta do is whistle.
Harpsichord.
Ha-hoo!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Oh, this is the happiest day of my life.
So, Cuthbert Greenway is now Doctor Greenway.
He'll need a dozen doctors before I get through with him.
Horatio, come quickly.!
What now?
This picture.
That's your beloved Tom.
This is the original painting.
I'd know it anywhere.
Look at the artist's name:
Stuart.
So? And that harpsichord.
That note "A."
It always did stick.
Hmph.
This is the original too.
I-I can't be wrong.
Do you realize what this means?
It means they were stuck with a lot of old furniture.
Don't be so stupid. It means they found all the original furniture.
Perhaps in this house, at this very moment, is your letter from George Washington.
My letter?
From George Washington?
Horatio, if we find it... It'll prove that we're not traitors.
Then we'll be able to get away from this place at last. Where'll we look first?
In the library, of course.
That's where Tom had it.
Come on. Let's search the library.
Nora! It won't be long now!
Melody, when you said "secret compartment," you meant secret.
I can't find a thing.!
Melody, do I have to do all the work around here?
Oh, my, wasn't I lovely, Horatio?
Course, I'm in the wrong place.
We're both in the wrong place.
If we don't find that letter, we're never gonna get out of here.
Be patient with me, Horatio.
Be patient.
Do you realize that my girlfriend Nora... has been waitin' for me for 165 years?
And a girl will only wait so long, and no longer. All right.
Let me see.
Desk, books, chair.
Clock. Have you searched the clock, Horatio?
The clock? Melody, in my day, I was the best tinker in the Colonies.
There's one thing I know absolutely: No one ever put a secret door in a clock.
We simply gotta find that letter. Please help me?
Come on.
I don't seem to remember this piece.
Uh-oh!
Oh!
Okay, Phantom, we gotcha covered!
Stick up your hands.
And this time, don't try disappearin'or we'll fill ya full oflead.
Mister, whoever you are, don't get violent.
There's his little playmate over there.
Get your hands up, sister.
Come on. Get 'em up.
Better get 'em up.
They sound awful mad.
Okay, Phantom, we wanna know who tipped ya off. Start singin'.
I'm... I'm not in good voice tonight.
You heard the boss. Sing.
Come on now. Sing.
Drink to me
Only with thine eyes
And I will
Cut the stallin'.
Pledge.
Pledge with mine
What's that?
The cops.! Blow.! Everybody, blow.!
Go on, boys.
Let 'em have it.!
Melody. Melody!
M-Melody!
M-Melody! Don't ever leave me alone!
Oh, be calm.
Be reasonable.
Sounds like the radio. Well, it can't be the Revolutionary War.
Listen again tomorrow night to The Phantom Hour.
How does the Phantom and his lady escape?
Like this.
Wait... Wait for me.
And now, Midnight Dan brings you a half hour of popular dance tunes.
Oh, the idea of Shelly playing the radio this hour of night!
I can't understand it. I tell you he's off the beam again.
Shelly! Well, that's a fine place to take a nap.
Shelly. Shelly!
Darling.
Oh, Millie, he's hurt.
Call Ralph, quickly.
Dr. Greenway. Dr. Greenway.
Dr. Greenway. Dr. Greenway.!
Emily... E-Emily, for heaven's sake, turn off the radio.
Oh, darling, what happened? Oh, my head.
Oh! Let's get him into the library.
I'm all right now, dear.
Thanks.
Oh. Oh, there you are.
For once, you'll really come in handy. They're in there.
It's stuffy in here.
Talk plainer. I can't. You got your foot in my mouth.
Come on out, Horatio.
It's all right now.
Look.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let's look for the letter tomorrow night. I'm tired.
But this is our perfect chance.
They're all in the library.
We can search the whole interior.
Yeah. You take the up-terior, and I'll take the down-terior.
Be calm. Be reasonable.
Oh, stop it, all of you!
I keep telling you
I didn't make this mess!
The radio woke me just like it woke the rest of you.
I came down here to turn it off.
When I reached for that doorknob, something, some invisible force, yanked it open, and then I was met by that gust of icy wind.
Don't get excited.
I'm not excited!
I keep telling you there was nobody there, and I got bopped on the head with this candlestick.
Moving under its own power.
Wait a minute, Mildred!
Millie. I'm telling you exactly what happened.
Don't stand there lookin' at me as if
I'm crazy. I'm just as sane as Ralph.
That's what I'm afraid of. You're overwrought. You're imagining things.
No, he's not. It's them, all right... the ghosts from the well.
They're up to their old mischief, throwing things around.
Oh, there's a curse on this house, all right.
Ghosts! They must've been a couple of interior decorators looking for a little overtime.
If I were you, I wouldn't make fun of them. They don't like that.
Really?
Maybe she's right. There are many strange legends about this house.
Couldn't it be possible that some forces from the world beyond...
Oh, let's stop all this.
It's nothing but hysteria.
Sheldon had another one of his sleepwalking spells.
He came downstairs and turned on the radio.
Now doesn't that sound like a sensible explanation, Ralph?
Well, I, uh... It was the ghosts. I know they were here.
And so does Dr. Greenway.
I think we all need a stimulant.
Where's the brandy, Emily?
In the living room.
I'll get it, I'll get it.
Cuthbert!
Come on!
I tripped you.!
I tripped you.!
Why...
Why, I just...
I just swore I...
No. No, this can't happen to me.
No, it's impossible.
It's a trick of my subconscious mind. I...
I-I-It's all wrong.
It just can't be. It...
Oh.
Now be calm.
Ralph. Ralph!
Be calm. Be cool. Uh...
Don't get excited, Ralph.
E-Everything is all right.
These things can't be.
It's, uh...
Thank you.
But, darling, I told you 50 times,
I wasn't... Sheldon! Sheldon!
Ralph! Ralph!
What's the matter?
You're a bad boy.
I'm sorry? I knew you were up to something.
Now you run along.
We have to find that letter.
All right.
Well, go on!
I'll go.
Go on. Hurry up.
Hurry up. I'm going upstairs again.
Mistress Melody, I'll go down into the cellar, and... Mistress Melody.
Mistress Melody!
No tricks! No tricks!
Ahh.
Oh, ifTom could only see me now.
Come on, Ralph.
Be calm. Be reasonable.
Ohh!
Keep 'em away! Keep 'em away!
They've got a grudge against me. Ohh!
Come on, Ralph.
Tell us what happened.
Oh, bottles floating through space, glasses filling up by themselves, and somebody tooted in my stethoscope.
See, you didn't believe me.
Maybe now you're willing to concede there's something odd going on.
No, I'm not, Shelly. You've merely communicated your hysteria to him.
Yep, yep, yep, I hear ya.
- Oh, get her.
- I hear ya callin' me.
Ghosts of the well, lead me to you.
Wait a minute. Better leave that here.
We need it much more than the ghosts do.
The ghosts of the well? Why should they want to persecute us?
Maybe they got an eviction notice and want to move in on us.
Well, you people can stay up all night babbling about ghosts, but the charming Mrs. Dean is gonna hit the sack, and I'll take my spirits with me.
Hello.
Millie.!
Millie! Millie, what's the matter?
Oh! Oh, Shelly, help me get her into the living room.
I was coming up the stairs and that thing...
How did this get here?
Oh, hurry, darling.
I-I'll take that.
Millie. Take it away! Take it away!
That dress! It's haunted! I saw it coming down the stairs all by itself!
I did!
That's impossible.
It is, huh? How about that hit I got on the head?
Yes, and what about the tooting in my stethoscope?
Oh, stop it.
Stop it, all of you.
I-I can't explain about the dress or anything else, but I do know there's nothing supernatural about it.
And if you don't all stop acting like a bunch of crazy neurotics,
I'm going to start acting like one myself.
Oh, well, listen, honey... Uh...
M-M-Melody! Melody!
Melody! Oh, Horatio, stop that!
Melody!
Stop that!
Let go of it, Horatio!
Pull harder.!
Horatio, let's get back to the tree. I'm afraid. Come on.
Ohh! Oh!
We'll think more clearly in the morning. We'd better.
I'll not spend another night in this house.
Look.
Now do you believe there's something supernatural going on here?
I don't know what to believe, but whatever it is, it's terrifying.
Ghosts of the well, come back.
They've gone. You've frightened them.
We did?
Yep.
They've gone back to the well, all right.
And we're going back to town, first thing in the morning.
Oh, June, please. You've got to help me figure this thing out.
Come on, darling.
No. I don't care what Emily says.
I'm not taking part in any séance.
I've had enough. But, darling, isn't it better to try to find the truth?
Let me read you something.
This is the record of a Major Putnam who shot the two traitors.
He says, "Then we tossed their bodies down the well, and I cursed their miserable spirits to be bound to Danbury Acres
'til crack of doom."
If it's anything at all, it must be those two poor devils.
They can't get off this property.
But, Sheldon, that's sheer medieval superstition.
Shelly is right, June.
As a psychiatrist,
I've got to agree with him.
If we all intend to keep our sanity, we've got to get to the bottom of this.
If a séance...
And that from a man who wrote a dozen articles exposing all séances as fakes.
Please, Mildred. Please, both of you. Let's do what Emily suggests.
If this séance doesn't work, I swear I'll give up the whole thing and go back to New York.
Is that fair enough? Oh, all right,
Sheldon. That's... That's a deal.
Thank you, darling.
Go ahead, Emily.
Now, put your hands on the table again, little fingers touchin'.
And we've all got to make our minds perfectly blank.
Well, that should be easy for you. It is. I...
Anelot dos mirabus piret cotar.
Nimbus et nosticus lazum bodar.
Did you feel that?
Yes. Something's happening.
It must be them people down at the house. They're up to somethin' again.
Oh, something's pulling me!
Me too. Hang on.
Hang on! Hang on!
Th-Th-The windows.
I can feel their presence.
We didn't mean any harm.
Won't you please let us go back to the well where we belong?
I promise we will never bother you again.
Oh, please let us go back to the well. Whaddya say?
Anelot dos mirabus piret cotar.
Nimbus et nosticus lazum bodar.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you ever so much.
Did you hear what that nice lady said?
What did she say?
Oh, be quiet and listen.
They're here.
Spirits of the well, we know the curse upon your souls.
We only wish to help you if we can.
Horatio, did you hear what that charming young man said? They want to help us.
It's a trick. I don't trust 'em. Let's go back.
If you wish to cooperate with us, rap on this table.
Once for "no," and twice for "yes."
Horatio, go on.
Do as he says.
Maybe they can help us find your letter.
My letter? Yeah. Yeah! Anelot dos mirabus piret cotar.
Nimbus et nosticus lazum bodar.
Spirits of the well, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
A-Are you willing to help us?
Are you the spirits of the two traitors?
Ow!
Ralph!
Don't you call me no traitor! You...
Why... Why do they always pick on me?
Perhaps it was your question that offended them, Ralph.
You're right.
I think you've hit it.
Are you trying to tell us that you're not traitors?
Then who are you? What are you? Identify yourselves.
Cuthbert Greenway, you know who I am.
I'm Horatio Prim, the tinker.
This is Melody Allen.
We were on our way to warn General
Washington about Benedict Arnold...
Horatio. Don't be silly. But I gotta...
Don't you realize they can't hear us? Who are you? Who are you?
Who am I? How am I gonna tell him who
I am if all I can do is rap yes or no?
I've got it!
Follow me.
They're goin' away. I feel
'em. They're goin' away.
Well, don't think it hasn't been interesting, because it hasn't.
How about a nice game of gin rummy?
Millie, sit down. We're going through with this experiment.
Emily, try calling them back, will ya? Shh.
Spirits of the well, come back. Come back!
They're here.
They're here.
Look!
Melody Allen!
Go on. Get back under the table.
They're trying to tell us that one of the ghosts is Melody Allen.
I don't understand. They're both supposed to be men.
Are you trying to tell us that one of you is Melody Allen?
Oh, now we're all confused.
Who is the other one?
"Who is the other one"? I keep tellin' ya who the other one is. It's me!
I wonder how we can get him to tell us who he is.
If we knew what their profession was, that might give us a hint. Yeah.
You've got it there. Wait a minute. Are you a soldier?
No. A gentleman?
Why not try that old rhyme? The one that has all sorts of people in it.
You know, "rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief."
June, that's a great idea. Spirits of the well, listen to this rhyme:
Were you a rich man?
Poor man?
He was a poor man. Well, then, doctor, lawyer, Indian chief won't apply.
Uh... How does the rest of it go?
Oh, "tinker..."
Wait a minute.
He's a tinker.!
Danbury mentions a tinker right in here. Let's see if I can find it.
"The shame I experienced because of my treasonable activities...
"was increased threefold when the maid, Nora,
"wrote me and asked for information concerning one Horatio Prim,
her fiancé, who was a tinker. "
Nora. Oh, Nora.
She did worry about me.
"He had disappeared from the manor on the night of the fire, a similar fate to my beloved and innocent Melody."
Oh, Tom. "I bethought myself that this must be...
the selfsame tinker whose letter of recommendation... "
A letter of recommendation.
"From George Washington...
I had taken forcibly from Nora and hidden in a secret drawer. "
Uh, wait a minute.
Just a minute.
Then if the tinker had a letter from George
Washington, he couldn't have been a traitor.
You see? We're right!
See that?
Don't tell me we're gonna spend the rest of the night trying to contact
George Washington!
Don't you understand?
They've been looking for proof of their innocence.
That letter.
Of course. That letter would remove the curse from them.
Horatio, they know!
Isn't it wonderful?
I did it! I did it! Oh, boy, we'll be outta here in no time!
Well, Sheldon, the original furniture is here.
All we have to do is find that drawer that Danbury mentioned.
Yes, the drawer. Perhaps they know.
Yeah.
I wonder. Let's ask them.
Mistress Allen,
Master Prim, where is the secret drawer? Do you know?
Odsbodkins and copper pots! That's just it. We don't know, do we?
Anelot dos mirabus piret cotar.
Nimbus et nosticus lazum bodar.
There she goes again. Must be number one on her hit parade.
Shh, Millie!
Please, answer me.
Have you any idea where this letter may be hidden?
Go slowly. Slowly.
We can't understand you.
M-M-Melody.
That ain't me doin' that.
No.
No!
No, no!
L-Look. I d-don't wanna scare you folks, but that ain't me under the table.
Melody.
Melody.
H-Her voice is changing.
Oh, it's Tom. My Tom.
You were gonna marry her?
Melody, my beloved.
It's Tom.
I've come to help you.
Oh, Shelly.
What does it mean?
It... It must be Danbury speaking through Emily.
Oh, fine.
A ghost-to-ghost broadcast.
H-Horatio, why can't I see him?
You can't.
You poor kid.
You see, he's got his wings, and we're still grounded.
Master Danbury, we wanna help Miss Melody.
Tell us, where is the secret drawer?
Start at 12:00, turn twice to 3:00.
At 10 past 1:00,
'twill open be.
Would you mind repeating that last part?
He is gone. He's gone.
His brief span on earth is over.
Tom! Tom!
But, Emily, Emily where is the secret drawer?
Secret drawer?
I'm sorry. I can't tell you anything else. Good night.
Start at 12:00, turn twice to 3:00. At 10 past...
Now he's got it! You bet your life I've got it! mean a clock. The letter's in the clock.
But there's over a dozen clocks in this house.
What do we care? We'll search every one.
Let's get started.
Don't get excited.
Melody.
Melody, they've got the answer.
The letter is hidden in the clock.
Tom only had that letter in the library. The library clock!
Yeah! Yeah!
Hooray!
Well, don't just stand there.
We've got to let them know.
Oh! I gotta tell Nora.
Nora! I'll be with you soon!
Won't I, Horatio?
Odsbodkins!
We're all mixed up!
Whew! Melody, don't ever do that again. I'm a boy.
Hurry. In the library.
Cuthbert. Whaddya want? Nothing.
Cuthbert! Whaddya want? Nothing!
Mr. Gage.
What do you want?
Nothing.
What do you want?
Get them to look in the library.
That's what I'm tryin' to do!
I have an idea. Come on. It isn't in this one.
The library. They're trying to tell us to come into the library.
Yeah, you're right.
They must mean that clock.
- Oh, no. That's not the clock.
- Yes, it is.
But, Shelly, they directed us here.
I'm sorry, but that isn't the clock. That happens to be one of my reproductions.
The original's in the museum. Go to New York and search the clock.
That board of directors won't talk to me. They barred me from the museum.
Darling, do you suppose they'd let me examine it?
They wouldn't let anybody touch that clock.
That's fine. Let's give the ghosts a 99-year lease and move back to Park Avenue.
Darling, I feel so sorry for them.
Well, so do I. What can
I do? I'll get the clock.
I'm the logical one to do it. Why you?
Has it ever occurred to you why
I'm the main target of these ghosts?
Your ancestor. That butler was an old so-and-so.
That's exactly right. He was.
There's every possibility that he did
Horatio Prim wrong.
Yeah, it could be.
If that's the truth,
this is my chance to atone for the sins of my forefathers.
I think you're right. I'll leave first thing in the morning.
Horatio! Ho...
Horatio, listen to me.
You don't have to tell me.
Oh, yes, I do.
Let's go back to the well,
Melody. You don't understand.
Dr. Greenway is going to the museum to get the clock.
He's gonna do that for us?
Yes, he's trying to make up for what Cuthbert did to you.
For what Cuthbert did to me? Mm-hmm.
Odsbodkins! Mm!
Melody, he's a nice man.
I'm gonna thank him.
Wait a minute, Ralph. Hold this and
I'll get another candle. Oh, sure.
Thank you, Dr. Greenway.
Thank you.
Millie!
My dear Dr. Greenway,
I know you by reputation,
but I repeat, we cannot allow so valuable
an antique to be removed from the premises.
But, Professor Dibbs, can't
I at least examine the clock?
Sorry, Doctor, but that's contrary to our policy.
I told you it was only a pair of shoes.
Sorry, madam, regulations.
Oh, sorry, sir. Anything under that coat, sir?
Uh, only me.
I've gotta watch my diet.
My! 4:00. How time does fly.
And so must I.
Bill! Bill! Hey, Bill, the Queen Anne clock is missing.
That guy. Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
Professor Dibbs!
Professor Dibbs!
Get me the police department immediately. Hurry!
I don't understand. The museum's closed by now. Ralph promised to call me.
Relax, darling. Our ghostly friends have waited a century and a half.
A few more minutes won't make any difference.
This is a mighty fateful moment.
Even the ghosts are worried.
I know. I can feel 'em.
They're right here in this room.
Yep. Yep.
I guess I'd better make some more tea.
Ghosts. Ghosts.
That's all she talks about.
Oh, uh, pardon me.
Is this chair taken?
Thank you.
Th-Thank you v-very much. I think I'll stand for a while.
Oh, that's Ralph at last.
Come on, Millie.
Uh, excuse me.
Melody, this is it!
He's here!
I forgot to do it again.
Lieutenant Mason, state police. Oh, how do you do?
Is Dr. Greenway here? Not yet. We're expecting him.
Fine. We'll wait.
Is anything wrong?
Your doctor friend stole a very valuable clock from the museum.
Stole it?
Yeah. Connors.
Yes, sir? Drive our car out of sight. Don't want Greenway to see it.
Right, sir. Lieutenant, if you'll come into the living room,
I think I can explain this.
Poor Dr. Greenway. Is he in trouble! What about us?
If they catch him, they'll take him and the clock
before Mr. Gage has a chance to search it.
Odsbodkins!
What do we do now?
We've got to keep him away from the house. Hurry, Horatio!
Ghosts? What do you take me for? A chump?
I know it's hard to believe, but we can prove it.
Horatio.
Melody.
Horatio!
Melody!
Horatio.!
Melody.!
Horatio.
Ah! We'll be back in a minute!
Hey! Hey! Dr. Greenway! Stop! Stop!
Dr. Greenway, it's a trap!
Don't go in there! Stop!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Stop! Stop!
Dr. Greenway! Dr. Greenway!
Don't go in there! It's a trap!
Oh, Horatio, he can't hear us!
We must stop him.
Psst. Psst. Dr. Greenway, the police are in the house.
Uh-oh.
Go hide in the stable.
Thank you, Emily. Thank you.
Mason! Lt. Mason!
Lt. Mason!
Dr. Greenway's car.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Look for the clock?
No.
Now, if I can only remember how that rhyme goes. Start at 12:00.
Uh-huh. I have it. Start at 12:00.
Yeah.
You gotta stop that noise.
Somebody's gonna hear you.
Do somethin'.
How's the rest go?
How does the rest go? How do I know?
I got it.
Turn twice to 3:00.
Lieutenant Mason.!
Hurry, Horatio!
They're coming!
Turn the hands of the dial. Okay.
Melody! The letter!
Hoo! Hoo!
It went in and out!
In and out! In and out!
It's gone. Did you see it open?
Yes, I saw it. It was there. Dr.
Greenway, the drawer was open!
The drawer was open!
I don't know...
Zip! Dr. Greenway! I'm not kiddin' ya! Stick up your hands.
With thine eyes And I will
Pledge. Pledge.
Pledge with mine
It would've been cheaper to buy a watch. Come on, Greenway.
Oh, hurry, Horatio. Get the clock. Okay.
Oh! Oh, come on, Horatio.
Hurry up and come on.
I had it right in my hands!
I know, but come on.
We'll get it.
Come on, Horatio. Come on.
If you'll only listen. We know the letter's in that clock. Yeah?
How? Tom Danbury's ghost told us so.
That's all, brother. Get in. Don't worry, Ralph.
We'll get the best lawyer in New York to defend you.
And you can always plead insanity. You know how.
It wasn't me.
It was Horatio.
Horatio, huh? Gonna give me some more of that...
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Hey, what's the idea of jammin' on the brakes like that?
I didn't touch the brakes. I suppose I did it!
Come on.
Let's get goin'.
Well, what's the matter now? I don't know, sir.
Something's holding us back.
I'd better get out and find out.
Horatio.
Horatio!
They stopped.
Shelly. June.
Don't worry, Dr. Greenway.
As long as we're in here, they can't get through the gates.
Horatio, do you think you can work this contraption? Why?
The well. We could hide the doctor and the clock there, until the police leave.
Hey, what an idea.
Now let's see.
He turned it with this.
He pushed that.
And stepped on this.
Aw, you've blown your top.
There's nothing the matter here.
Get in the backseat. I'll drive. Okay, Lieutenant.
Now get in!
It's supposed to run the other way.! Push the handle down.
Whoo.!
- This is fun.
- There's nobody at the wheel.
Hey, Greenway!
Stop that car!
Get outta the way.!
Close the gates!
What do I do now?
Look out!
Melody.!
It's headin' for the well.
M-Melody.
Oh, Horatio.
A fella could get killed doin' this.
Odsbodkins!
Whoa! Well, how are we gonna explain this to the chief?
Ah! So you tried to get away, huh?
No, no. No, no!
Ralph, you all right?
I don't know yet.
Ralph.
The clock!
Shelly! Shelly, here it is!
- The letter.
- Melody! They got it! They got it!
Now do you believe us? Well, right now, I'll believe anything.
But will Chief Callahan believe me? No.
Now the curse is ended.
This proves they weren't traitors.
And their spirits are no longer bound to these acres.
They're free. Free.
We're free. We're free.
Melody, what are we waiting for?
Come on!
Wait a minute.
Here, Lieutenant, this is yours.
Thanks. I'm...
Well?
Well?
Well, there's nothing to be f-frightened of.
Mistress Melody, ladies first. You go.
I'm out!
You made it.
Melody! I...
Melody. Melody!
Oh, Horatio.
There you are.
Thank you.
Melody. Melody.
Oh, it's Tom. My Tom.
Good-bye, Horatio.
I'm going to miss you.
Good-bye, Melody.
I'm gonna miss you too.
But don't you worry. Just as soon as Nora and I get settled, we'll have you and Tom over for dinner.
I'll have Nora bake a nice, big angel cake.
Horatio.
Here I am, Horatio.
Nora! Nora!
Horatio.
Here I am.
Nora!
Oh, Horatio.
You've waited for me.
It's been a long time.
Now that I'm here, nothing can keep us apart.
Let me in.
I can't, Horatio.
Why?
Odsbodkins.
Lord Henry Wotton had set himself early in life to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.
He lived only for pleasure, but his greatest pleasure was to observe the emotions of his friends while experiencing none of his own.
He diverted himself by exercising a subtle influence on the lives of others.
18, I think you said, sir.
Shall I wait, sir?
Yes.
Among Lord Henry's friends was the painter Basil Hallward.
He had been strangely secretive about his latest painting, and Lord Henry, sensing a mystery, determined to discover what it was that his friend wished to conceal.
Hello.
I'm sorry, milord.
Mr. Hallward is not at home.
Mr. Hallward doesn't wish to be disturbed.
It's your best work,
Basil.
Of course,
I can't believe anybody's really as handsome as that portrait.
Who is he?
Why are you being so secretive about it?
You ought to send it to the grosvenor.
I shall not send it anywhere.
I've put too much of myself into it.
Ha ha ha!
I knew you'd laugh, but it's true.
There isn't any resemblance between you and this adonis.
You have an intellectual expression, and intellect destroys the beauty of any face.
Don't flatter yourself.
You're not the least like him.
Of course I'm not, and I'm glad of it.
The wisdom of buddha.
Why are you glad you're not like him?
We suffer for what the gods give us, and I'm afraid
Dorian Gray will pay for his good looks.
Is that his name?
Yes. I didn't intend to tell you.
If I'm to keep visiting you,
I'll have to send you good sherry.
Why didn't you intend to tell me his name?
As I've grown older,
I've come to love secrecy.
I suppose that sounds foolish to you.
Come into the garden.
It doesn't sound foolish.
You forget that I'm married.
The one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary to both parties.
I believe you're a good husband but that you're ashamed of your own virtues.
Your cynicism is simply a pose.
Being natural is simply a pose- the most irritating pose I know.
Tell me the real reason you won't exhibit the picture.
There's little to tell, harry.
Besides, you won't believe it.
I'll believe anything, provided it's quite incredible.
I'm afraid this will seem so.
There's something
I can't quite understand, something mystic about it.
Mystic?
I can't explain it, but whenever Dorian poses for me, it seems as if a power outside myself were guiding my hand.
It's as if the painting had a life of its own, independent of me.
That's why I won't exhibit it.
It belongs to Dorian Gray, and I shall give it to him.
I want to meet him.
We shall be friends.
I always choose my friends for their good looks and my enemies for their good intellects.
I despise your principles, but I enjoy the way you express them.
I like persons better than principles and persons with no principles better than anything else.
I remember where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.
Where was it?
Don't look startled.
It was at my aunt agatha's.
She said she'd discovered a wonderful young man to help her with her charities, and his name was
Dorian Gray.
I pictured somebody with spectacles tramping about on huge feet, so I avoided meeting him.
That's a very common butterfly, Basil- limenitis sevilla.
Hardly belongs in a gentleman's garden.
I'm glad you didn't meet Dorian Gray.
I don't
## want you to meet him.
Who's that at your piano, Basil?
You've come early today, Dorian.
Have i?
You must lend me these pieces.
That depends on how you sit today.
I thought the picture would be finished today.
It will be.
Please go on, mr. Gray.
This is Lord Henry Wotton, an old oxford friend.
My aunt has spoken to me about you.
You're one of her favorites.
You shouldn't go in for philanthropy.
Harry, would you mind if I asked you to go?
Am I to go, mr. Gray?
Stay and explain about philanthropy.
Basil, you've said you liked your sitters to have someone to chat to.
Sit down, then, harry.
Dorian, get on the platform and don't pay attention to Lord Henry.
He has a bad influence over his friends, with the exception of myself.
Have you really a bad influence?
There's no such thing as a good influence.
All influence is immoral.
Why?
Because the aim of life is self-development, to realize one's nature perfectly.
That's what we're here for.
A man should live out his life fully and completely, give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream.
Every impulse that we suppress broods in the mind and poisons us.
There's one way to get rid of a temptation, and that's to yield to it.
Resist it, and the soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself.
There's nothing that can cure the soul but the senses, just there's nothing that can cure the senses but the soul.
Turn left, Dorian.
The gods have been good to you, mr. Gray.
Why do you say that?
You have youth, the one thing worth having.
I don't feel that,
Lord Henry.
Someday you'll feel it terribly.
What the gods give, they quickly take away.
Time is jealous of you.
Don't squander the gold of your days.
Live! Let nothing be lost upon you.
Be afraid of nothing.
Your youth will last such a little time, and you can never get it back.
As we grow older, our memories are haunted by the exquisite temptations we hadn't the courage to yield to.
The world is yours for a season.
It would be tragic if you realized too late, as so many others do, that there's only one thing in the world worth having, and that is youth.
Dorian gray had never heard the praise of folly so eloquently expressed.
The creed of pleasure soared into a philosophy of life while Dorian stood as if he were under a spell.
He felt afraid of Lord Henry's ideas and ashamed of himself for being afraid.
It was as if he were learning to know himself for the first time, as if a stranger had revealed his own secret thoughts to him.
For the first time, he became conscious of his youth and of the fact that one day he would lose it.
My visit hasn't been wasted.
I found a rare and beautiful butterfly.
It's very unusual.
Don't you think it's beautiful, mr. Gray?
Yes, Lord Henry.
Sit down, Dorian.
I'm glad you met
Lord Henry after all.
Are you glad, mr. Gray?
I'm glad now.
I wonder if
I shall always be glad.
Always? That's a dreadful word.
Women are so fond it.
They spoil romance by trying to make it last forever.
The only difference between caprice and lifelong passion is that caprice lasts a little longer.
I believe our hostess has appeared.
You're just in time, darling, to watch me sign
Dorian's painting.
Can I sign it, too?
I think you're entitled to, since you haven't missed a sitting.
"G" for "Gladys."
Which do you prefer, Gladys-
Dorian Gray or his picture?
I like Dorian.
You prefer him today, but when you're a young lady, you may prefer the portrait.
It will look as it does today, but we shall be changed- your uncle and i and even Dorian.
Dorian won't change.
Dorian will stay just as he is till I'm grown.
Won't you, Dorian?
Of course I shall, darling.
You must say good-bye, precious.
Nanny's waiting.
Come along.
Hurry. On your way.
What about me, young lady?
Has Dorian Gray stolen you from me completely?
Good-bye,
Lord Henry.
When this is known,
I shall be torn to shreds in every drawing room.
Shouldn't a gentleman remove his hat in the presence of a lady, parker?
Ha ha!
I never take off my hat except when
I'm out of doors.
She'll be as lovely as your sister was, Basil.
Yes.
But I'm afraid Dorian has stolen her heart from me, too.
I must congratulate you, Basil.
Look at yourself, mr. Gray.
As I grow old, this picture will remain always young.
If it were only the other way... if it were I who would always be young and the picture that would grow old.
That would be hard lines on your work, Basil.
I should object strongly.
You oughtn't to express such a wish around that cat.
It's an egyptian god, and it's quite capable of granting your wish.
Lord Henry is right.
When one loses one's youth, one loses everything.
Perhaps a cup of tea will bring you around, Dorian.
You will have some too, harry- or do you object to simple pleasures?
I adore simple pleasures.
They're the last refuge of the complex.
It's more than a painting.
It's part of myself.
As soon as you're varnished and framed, you'll be sent home.
Do whatever you like with yourself.
Send the egyptian cat.
The god and the picture shouldn't be separated.
If Dorian wants it.
If only the picture could change and I could be always what I am now.
For that, I would give everything.
There's nothing in the whole world
I would not give.
I would give my soul for that.
Dorian began to venture alone on warm summer evenings into surroundings which were strange to him.
Filled with curiosity about places and people remote from his own experience, he wandered to the haugh world of London, the words of Lord Henry vibrating in his mind.
"Live! Let nothing be lost upon you.
Be afraid of nothing."
The two turtles is honored by the visit of a gentleman.
If you please, sir.
I give you the sweetheart of the two turtles, our own sibyl vane.
The snow was very plentiful and crumbs were very few when a weather-beaten sparrow through a mansion window flew her eye fell on a golden cage a sweet love song she heard sung by a pet canary there a handsome yellow bird he said to her, miss sparrow
I've been struck by cupid's arrow will you share my cage with me?
She looked up at his castle with its ribbon and its tassel and in plaintive tones said she good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd rather brave the cold on a leafless tree than a prisoner be in a cage of gold
I'd gladly introduce you, sir, but she's proud.
She won't meet anybody.
Come, my delightful dove!
Descend and make a pilgrimage with me among these mortals.
The spoiled and petted yellow bird could scarce believe it true that a common sparrow should refuse a bird with blood so blue he told her the advantages of riches and of gold she answered that her liberty for gold could not be sold she said,
I must be going but he cried, no, no, it's snowing and the wintry windstorm blows stay with me, my little deary for without you,
'twould be dreary but she only sighed, ah, no good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd gladly mate with you
I love you, little yellow bird but I love my freedom, too so, good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd rather brave the cold on a leafless tree than a prisoner be in a cage of gold she's taken with you, sir.
Say the word, and I'll take you backstage.
Thank you, no.
Night after night,
Dorian went to the two turtles to watch sibyl vane.
A patron of the arts, mrs. Vane.
He's come each evening for a fortnight.
He greatly admires your daughter.
If you will permit me,
I have a request.
You're very kind, sir.
Miss vane, will you sing the little yellow bird for me... now?
She will, sir- gladly.
There's no one to play.
Everyone's gone.
I think I might manage the accompaniment.
You will, won't you, deary?
Yes... on one condition.
Please.
I apologize for my daughter.
So good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd rather brave the cold on a leafless tree than a prisoner be in a cage of gold it's wonderful.
Did... did you write it?
Frederic chopin... for a woman he loved.
Her name was george sand.
Someday I'll tell you about it.
I should like that.
What did the music mean to you?
I don't know.
It is full of emotion, but it's not happy.
No, it's not happy.
Why was he unhappy?
Perhaps because he felt his youth slipping away from him.
What an odd thing for you to say.
Why?
You're so young.
Yes... and you also.
What is the music called?
Has it a name?
A kind of name.
It is called prelude.
Is this how you watch over sibyl, mother?
James, your sister-
I wish I wasn't going to australia.
If only my articles hadn't been signed.
I want sibyl to make a brilliant marriage.
Actresses often marry into upper classes.
Who is this young dandy?
I don't know, but he's rich.
What's his name, sibyl?
What are his intentions?
I don't know his intentions, but I know his name- sir tristan.
You don't know his name, yet you permitted him to... you ought not to have permitted such familiarity.
He is good.
There is no evil in him.
Did you see his face?
No, but I wish
I had, because if he ever does you wrong, I'll kill him.
You're foolish, jim.
You talk like the melodramas mother used to act in.
I received a great deal of gratifying attention in those days.
Mother, watch over sibyl while I'm gone.
##Jim.
You're going away tonight.
The ship will take you far away over the dark waters.
Don't let me remember you angry and troubled.
That's better.
Can't you read what people are in their faces?
You think I'm silly when I call him sir tristan, but to me he's like one of king arthur's knights who took the vow of chivalry to battle against all evildoers, to defend the right, to protect all women, to be true in friendship and faithful in love.
I've never heard a sweeter warbler.
Little yellow bird.
Late as usual, harry.
Forgive me, aunt agatha.
Punctuality is the thief of time, harry says.
Victoria, darling.
I love coming to your house, aunt agatha.
It's one of the few places
I'm likely to meet my husband.
Oh. I'm always dropping it.
Mr. Gray has something to tell you.
We're dying to learn what it is.
It can wait until luncheon is over.
Harry, why do you want mr. Gray to give up the east end?
He's a wonderful musician.
They love his playing.
The east end is a very important problem.
It's the problem of slavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.
I suspect, Lord Henry, we're interested in the poor to amuse ourselves, especially as we grow older and are unfit for other amusements.
Tell me how to become young again.
Can you remember any great errors you committed in your youth, duchess?
A great many.
To regain one's youth, one must repeat one's follies.
A dangerous theory.
One of life's secrets.
Most people die of creeping common sense and discover too late that one never regrets one's mistakes.
One pays a terrible price.
We're overcharged for everything.
One pays in other ways than money.
What sort of ways, sir thomas?
I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in the consciousness of degradation.
No civilized man regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man knows what a pleasure is.
I know what pleasure is- it's to adore someone.
I think I can guess what you have to tell me.
Adoring someone is better than being adored.
Women treat us like humanity treats its gods.
They worship us and keep bothering us to do something for them.
Harry, you're incorrigible.
Women give men the very gold of their lives.
But they invariably want it back in small change.
Women inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and prevent us from carrying them out.
I don't understand you.
You seem to know us women awfully well.
I'm analyzing women at present.
The subject is less difficult than I believed.
Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.
These views are horrifying, lady agatha!
I did not expect to hear the devil's advocate at your table.
I apologize for my intelligent remarks.
I'd forgotten you were a member of parliament.
You will forgive me if I leave at once.
Before the quail- the first of the season?
I ordered them especially for you.
Surely not before the quail, sir thomas.
Think with the liberals and eat with the tories.
How men argue!
I never know what they're talking about.
Do sit, sir thomas.
Lord Henry's ideas are demoralizing and delightful.
They're not to be taken seriously.
I confess.
I never could resist lady agatha's quail.
What have you to tell me?
From what you said, my guess is you've fallen in love.
I'm engaged to be married.
Where are we going, harry?
Grosvenor square, number 7.
It's Dorian we're going to see?
We'll pick him up, then see his fiancee.
Dorian, engaged?
To whom?
To an actress in a cheap vaudeville.
With dyed hair and a painted face.
Don't run down such things.
There's extraordinary charm in them.
Surely you can't be serious.
I hope I shall never be more serious.
You can't possibly approve.
I never approve or disapprove of anything.
Dorian proposes to marry a girl.
Every experience is of value, and marriage is certainly an experience.
Dorian will make this girl his wife and six months later become infatuated with someone else.
He could be so unfaithful?
Faithfulness is merely laziness.
Number 7, sir.
I've been watching for you.
Go to lower euston road, number 22.
Lower euston road, sir?
Lower euston road.
They're always surprised when I give that address.
Hurry!
I want you to meet her before she sings.
I hope you'll always be this happy, Dorian.
Thank you, Basil.
Our engagement's still a secret.
What will your guardian say?
He's sure to be furious, but there's nothing he can do.
When did you mention marriage?
I didn't make any formal proposal.
I said I loved her.
She said she was not worthy to be my wife.
Women are wonderfully practical.
In situations like that, we forget to mention marriage.
They always remind us.
Sibyl has made me forget your poisonous theories- theories about life, about pleasure.
Only pleasure is worth having a theory about.
It's nature's sign of approval.
When we're happy, we're good.
When we're good, we're not always happy.
Sibyl is the answer to your cynicism.
You'll understand when you see her.
So, good-bye little yellow bird
I'd rather brave the cold on a leafless tree than a prisoner be in a cage of gold this marriage is quite right.
The moment we met her,
I was convinced.
She's charming and innocent- transparently so.
I knew you would say that.
She's all that, but I don't agree with Basil.
She loves you so much, you have no need to marry her.
What wickedness are you contemplating?
I should be angry, harry, but I'm too happy.
Sibyl is sacred.
Only sacred things are worth touching.
I begin to find you disgusting.
Don't listen to him, Dorian.
Don't worry, Basil.
I'm immune to his ideas.
Then I needn't tell you how I'd proceed.
What would you do, harry?
I should invite her to my house to see
Basil's portrait.
I'd ask her not to leave.
She'd be shocked.
I'd pretend to be disappointed.
If she still wished to go, I'd become cold, ask her to let herself out, saying I couldn't bear sad farewells or something.
If she left, I'd believe her to be as good as she is beautiful and marry her.
I've always thought your wickedness supposed.
I know better now.
You're an unmitigated cad.
Will you try my experiment, Dorian?
Miss vane, has sir tristan- as you've charmingly called him- ever invited you to see the portrait
Basil Hallward has made of him?
No. I should love to see it. May i?
Of course, darling- tonight, if you wish.
I shall always remember this room just as it is now... the lamplight, you at the piano, my own happiness.
Your clock thinks it's time for me to go.
Clocks can't help being disagreeable.
They think it's their duty.
It's that cat.
I thought I saw its eyes move.
Perhaps you did.
Lord Henry says it's one of the 73 great gods of egypt.
Doesn't it frighten you?
It does, a little.
Listen to this.
"Dawn follows dawn, and nights grow old,
"and all the while, this curious cat
"lies crouching on the chinese mat
"with eyes of satin rimmed with gold.
"Get hence, you loathsome mystery.
"Hideous animal, get hence.
"You wake in me each bestial sense.
"You make me what
I would not be.
"You make my creed a barren sham.
"You wake foul dreams... of sensual life."
What a strange poem.
Who wrote it?
A brilliant young irishman out of oxford.
His name is oscar wilde.
Why do you look at me so strangely?
What would you do, sibyl, if I should say to you, don't leave me now, don't go home?
What would you do, sibyl?
I suppose I should have expected a conventional reaction.
Good night, then.
Good night.
You don't mind letting yourself out, do you?
I can't bear sad farewells.
A wise friend warned me that your innocence, upon which
I would have staked my life, would fail to meet the test I set before you.
I called his wisdom cynicism.
Now I know better.
You've killed my love.
You have been false to the ideal
I'd formed of you.
You used to stir my imagination.
Now you are nothing to me.
I will never see you again or mention your name or think of you.
Henceforth, I shall live only for pleasure.
Everything else is meaningless, and if this leads me to the destruction of my soul, only you are responsible.
Do not try to see me.
I shall leave england and not return for a long time.
I'm sending with this letter a gift of money which will compensate you for any disappointment you may feel.
I have been living in a land of illusions.
Now I shall make an end of the dreams.
My real life begins- my own life, in which you cannot possibly have any part.
Five minutes, miss vane.
In spite of himself,
Dorian was troubled by what he had done.
His uneasy conscience made him avoid those he knew.
All night, he had wandered alone through the dimly lit streets and evil-looking houses of the London haugh world.
When at last he returned to his silent, shuttered house in mayfair, he could not overcome a sense of something... ominous impending.
His eye fell on the portrait
Basil Hallward had painted of him.
In the dim, shaded light, the face appeared to him to be a little... changed.
The expression looked somehow different.
One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth.
It was very strange.
There was no doubt that the whole expression had altered.
The lines of cruelty about the mouth were unmistakable.
There was no such expression on## his ## face.
If only the picture could change and I could be always as I am now.
For that, I would give everything.
There's nothing in the whole world
I would not give.
I would give my soul for that.
But surely his wish had not been fulfilled.
Such things were impossible.
It was monstrous even to think of it.
What if someone else observed the horrible change- his valet, perhaps?
What if Basil Hallward asked to look at his own picture?
But he was being ridiculous.
This was a mere hallucination- an illusion brought on by his troubled senses.
The picture had not changed.
He was mad to think so.
A painted canvas could not alter.
He would look at it again after he had slept, when he was calmer, and he would laugh at this fantastic idea.
But in the afternoon when he returned to examine the portrait again, fantastic as the idea was, his memory of that cruel look was disturbingly vivid.
It was true.
The expression had altered.
There was no doubt of it.
It was incredible, and yet, it was a fact.
Was this portrait to become for him the emblem of his own conscience?
Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?
But if this painting was to be his conscience made visible, he would let it instruct him.
He would give it no reason to reproach him.
He would live purely and nobly.
He had been cruel to sibyl vane, but he could make that right.
She could still be his wife.
He would marry her.
They could be happy together.
He implored her forgiveness.
He blamed himself.
He gave way to the luxury of self-reproach.
When he finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.
Dorian, let me in. I must see you.
Open the door, Dorian.
I'll not go away until I see you.
Dorian, let me in!
You shouldn't lock yourself in.
I'm sorry for it all.
You mean about sibyl vane.
Yes, of course.
It's all right.
I'm grateful to you.
I've learned to know myself better.
From now on, I'll do what my conscience bids me.
What on earth are you talking about?
I'm going to marry sibyl vane.
You're going to say something cynical about marriage.
Don't say it.
I asked sibyl to marry me.
I won't break my word.
Then you don't know.
Know what?
Haven't you read the morning paper?
No, I haven't.
What is it, harry?
What's happened?
Sibyl vane is dead.
That's why I hurried here to see you.
I wanted to see you first.
I assumed you knew.
Don't get mixed up in the inquest.
They don't know your name at the theater.
Did sibyl... tell me everything, harry.
It was obviously not an accident.
It must be put that way to the public. leaving the theater with her mother.
She went back to her dressing room.
They found her lying on the floor.
She'd swallowed something- by mistake, they say.
She died instantaneously.
It's tragic, of course, but you mustn't brood over it.
You must see it in its proper perspective.
Put it out of your mind.
Come dine with me.
Afterwards, we'll see## don giovanni.
You can come to my sister's box.
So I have murdered sibyl vane, as surely as if
I'd cut her throat.
I can't see why you should blame yourself.
She thought she'd lost you, but no woman destroys herself who isn't already unbalanced.
If you'd married this girl, you'd both have been wretched.
It would have failed.
I remember your saying good resolutions are always made too late.
Mine certainly were.
View this tragedy as an episode in the spectacle of life.
What is it that has happened?
Someone has killed herself for love of you.
I wish I'd had such an experience.
The women who have admired me have always insisted on living on long after I've ceased to care for them.
They become stout and tedious.
They go in for reminiscences- that awful memory of woman.
I found myself next to such a woman the other night.
She had once proposed to sacrifice the world for me.
That moment fills one with the terror of eternity.
It happened years ago.
She said I'd spoiled her life.
However, she ate an enormous dinner.
No woman would have done for me what sibyl did for you.
Will you dine with me tonight?
I don't feel up to it.
Perhaps you'll join me at the opera.
My sister's box number is 27.
You'll see her name on the door.
I don't want you to miss the duet.
Mr. Hallward, mr. Gray's gone to the opera.
To the opera?
Yes, sir. Is there any message, sir?
No. No. I'll come by in the morning.
In the morning,
Dorian no longer wanted the consolation of his friend, nor his reproaches.
His pride and his sense of guilt prompted him to assume an air of indifference.
Hello, Basil.
Sorry to keep you.
Have you had breakfast?
Yes, thank you.
I'm famished.
Mind if I eat?
Of course not.
You went to the opera with sibyl vane lying dead?
What is past is past.
You call yesterday the past?
Shallow people require years to get rid of an emotion.
A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he invents pleasures.
I won't be at the mercy of my emotions.
I want to use them.
Something has changed you completely.
You look exactly the same, but you talk as if you had no heart.
You've come too late.
If you'd come yesterday at a particular moment- half past 5:00 or quarter to 6:00- you would have seen how deeply I was affected.
Harry had no idea what
I was going through.
I suffered immensely.
Then it passed away.
I cannot repeat an emotion.
No one can.
This isn't you talking, Dorian.
These are harry's ideas.
It has nothing to do with harry.
Harry didn't give you that yellow book I saw?
It's vile, evil, corrupt, decadent.
I detest it.
What would you like me to read, Basil?
Since you ask me... the light of asia.
I'm never without it.
The story of buddha?
The story of buddha, a good man.
Promise me you'll read it.
I promise.
You've done a sketch of sibyl.
Charming.
May I have it?
Of course.
I must go now,
Dorian.
I'm relieved to find you in good spirits in spite of what's happened.
It's good of you to be so concerned.
Before I go,
I'd like to look at my painting of you.
There's a screen in front of it.
I thought the room looked different.
The light was too strong.
Surely not.
It's an admirable place for it.
Wait.
You must not look at it.
Not look at my work?
You're not serious.
Why shouldn't i?
I don't offer any explanation, but if you try to look at that picture,
I'll never speak to you again.
What on earth is the matter with you?
I'm planning to exhibit it next month.
You told me a month ago you'd never exhibit it.
You told harry the same thing.
At that time, the painting had a strange fascination for me.
It seemed to have a life of its own.
It affected me so much,
I felt I couldn't let it be seen publicly.
Perhaps you've seen the same mysterious quality in it.
Have you noticed something curious in the painting- something that at first did not strike you but revealed itself to you suddenly?
I see you did.
I saw something in it- something that seemed to be very curious.
You were right.
There can be something fatal about a portrait.
I think I understand what you feel, and I respect your wishes.
Perhaps someday you'll recover from it as I did.
I'll certainly not let it destroy our friendship.
I'm glad of that.
Good-bye, Dorian.
Good-bye, Basil.
It had been mad of him to allow the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room to which his friends had access.
Henceforth, he must be on his guard against everyone.
At the top of the house was his old schoolroom, which had not been used for years.
No one ever entered it.
Nothing was in it but old schoolbooks and toys gathering dust and cobwebs.
The picture could be safely hidden away there.
He would lock it up.
He himself would keep the key.
There was no need for the servants ever to enter the room.
He would have to let victor go and the others.
He must bring new servants into the house.
In this room, every moment of his childhood and its stainless purity came back to him.
Here, among the innocent souvenirs of his childhood, the hideous portrait would be forever hidden away.
The face painted in the canvas could grow bestial, sodden, and unclean, and no one would ever see it- no one... except himself.
He was to have eternal youth while the portrait bore the burden of his shame.
He was caught in an evil destiny.
As the years passed, the miracle of Dorian's changeless youth caused wonder but rarely suspicion.
Even those who had heard the most evil things against him- strange rumors about his mode of life which became the chatter of the clubs- could not believe anything to his dishonor when they saw him.
He had the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world.
But while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.
Curious stories were current about him.
It was rumored he'd been seen in a low den in the distant parts of whitechapel.
His extraordinary absences became notorious, and when he reappeared again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners or look at him with cold, searching eyes.
Some of those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him.
Women who, for his sake, had set convention at defiance would seem to go pale if Dorian Gray entered the room.
He could not endure to be long out of england or to be separated from the picture.
He was afraid that during his absence someone might gain access to the room where it was hidden.
Then suddenly, some night he would go down to dreadful places near blue gate fields and stay there day after day.
When he had recovered from visits to the abyss, he would stand in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself but filled at other times with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of evil.
He would examine with minute care the hideous lines that scarred the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy, sensual mouth, wondering which were more horrible- the signs of sin or the signs of age.
He found reasons to justify his actions.
He told himself that man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations.
To live the simple, sincere, honest life was hardly to live at all.
Was insincerity such a terrible thing?
Dorian thought not.
Twas merely a method by which we could multiply our personalities.
Yet, there was one person towards whom he found it difficult to be insincere.
It was Basil Hallward's niece Gladys, who had loved him since she was a child.
So, good-bye, little yellow bird
I'd rather brave the cold on a leafless tree than a prisoner be in a cage of gold
I was close by and came in.
Found this old song in your piano bench.
It's charming.
So is the face my uncle sketched on it.
He did do it, didn't he?
I know his style so well.
Did she sing this song?
Who is she?
Do tell me about her.
She died many years ago, when you were only a little girl.
Did you love her very much, Dorian?
Yes.
Good-bye, Dorian.
I'm looking forward to your party.
It will be wonderful.
I'm not as lovely as that picture, am i?
Of course not.
I think
I've discovered why Dorian hasn't proposed to me.
I've decided what to do.
What have you decided?
I'm going to ask him to marry me- tonight, perhaps.
What about david stone?
He wouldn't take you to Dorian's party if he knew your intentions.
Of course he would, but I don't intend to tell him.
No, don't tell david.
You cad!
I never thoughtu'd eavesdrop.
Don't be alarmed about Dorian, mr. Hallward.
Gladys will marry me.
I have nothing to say about it?
I wouldn't let you marry that devil.
Don't say anything against him.
There are others to say it for me.
There's no evil in Dorian.
Anybody can see that by looking at him.
He hasn't asked you.
I'll ask him myself, tonight.
In front of those people?
I'll get him alone.
It's a big house.
Good night, sir.
Good night, david.
What's wrong, Dorian?
Is there something
I don't know about?
You must have heard the stories they tell of me.
Don't they frighten you?
I don't believe them.
Suppose I told you they're true?
I will never believe anything evil of you.
What do
## you ## know of evil?
I only know there is none in you.
If you had some great trouble, Dorian,
I would want to share it.
If I were to marry you, it would be an incredible wickedness.
Is that a way of saying you don't love me?
If you like.
It's very beautiful, Dorian.
Thank you.
Would you find david for me?
I must go now.
I've been exploring your house, Dorian.
It's better than a museum.
You must have some priceless possessions in that room if you keep them locked up.
May I see them sometime?
What rare things have you stored away there, Dorian?
I suspected as much.
I want to leave now, david.
Of course.
Good night,
Dorian.
Good night.
It was november 9th, the eve of his 38th birthday, as Dorian often remembered afterwards.
He was walking home about 11:00 from Lord Henry's.
A strange sense of fear for which he could not account came over him at the sight of Basil Hallward and prevented him from making any sign of recognition.
Dorian!
I thought it was you- or your fur coat- but I wasn't sure.
Didn't you recognize me?
In this fog?
I can't recognize grosvenor square.
My house must be somewhere about, but I'm not certain.
I've been waiting for you since 9:00.
I told your man to go to bed.
I'm off to Paris tonight.
I wanted to see you before I left.
I'm sorry you're going away.
I suppose you'll be back soon?
I shall be gone for several months.
I'm taking a studio in Paris to finish a picture
I have in my head.
Gladys will join me later on.
May I come in for a moment?
Won't you miss your train?
It leaves at 12:15.
It's only 11:00.
I was going to the club to look for you.
Luggage won't delay me.
I've sent on my things.
I have only this bag.
Come in, or the fog will get into the house.
I hope you're not going to talk about anything serious.
Nothing is serious nowadays- at least, nothing should be.
What I have to say is## serious, Dorian.
Don't frown like that.
You make it so much more difficult for me.
I hope it's not about myself.
I'm tired of myself.
It is about yourself, and I must say it to you.
I'll only keep you half an hour.
You sound terrifying, Basil.
It's for your sake
I'm speaking.
I think you should know the things that are being said against you.
I don't want to know them.
I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don't interest me.
They lack novelty.
You must be interested in your own reputation.
Mind you, I don't believe these rumors.
I can't believe them when I see you.
There aren't any secret vices.
Such things write themselves across a man's face.
You, with your untroubled youth-
I find it hard to credit anything against you.
When I hear these things people whisper,
I don't know what to say.
I absolve you from the necessity of defending me.
You can't dismiss these charges.
Why does the duke leave a room when you enter?
Not because he knows about my life, but because
I know about his.
Why are your friendships fatal to people?
That boy in the guards committed suicide.
What about adrian singleton and Lord wayne's son?
What gentleman would be seen with either of them?
The boy in the guards loved a woman he felt he couldn't live without.
Am I to blame?
Wayne's son marries a woman no one receives.
Is that my fault?
Adrian writes his friend's name across a bill.
Am I his keeper?
One can judge a man by the effect he has on his friends.
Yours seem filled with an insatiable madness for pleasure.
And when I think how fond Gladys is of you... what has Gladys to do with it?
Nothing, I hope, and nothing in the future, if I can prevent it.
I'm told things it seems impossible to doubt.
Lord wallace was my friend at oxford.
He showed me a letter his wife had written when she was dying.
Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read.
I told him that I knew you, and you were incapable of anything of the kind.
No. Do I know you?
Before I could answer that,
I should have to see your soul.
To see my soul.
Yes, to see your soul, but only god can do that.
You shall see it yourself, tonight.
Why shouldn't you look at it?
It's your own handiwork.
You can tell the world about it afterward, if you like.
No one will believe you.
You've chattered enough about corruption.
Now you'll look at it.
I'll show you my soul.
I can make no sense out of what you're saying.
I only ask you to give me some answer to the horrible charges against you.
Tell me they're untrue, and I'll believe you.
Come upstairs, Basil.
I keep a diary from day to day.
I'll show it to you.
I don't want to read anything.
I want a plain answer to my question.
You'll find that upstairs.
You won't have to read long.
You're the one man in the world who's entitled to know everything about me.
You've had more to do with my life than you think.
You think it's only god who sees the soul?
In spite of the indescribable corruption of the portrait,
Basil was still able to recognize his painting of Dorian.
It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror came.
It was as if some moral leprosy were eating the thing away.
He could not believe he had made this portrait, yet there was his name, just as he had painted it.
But this is monstrous.
It's beyond nature, beyond reason.
What does it mean?
On the day you finished this painting,
I made a wish.
Perhaps
## you ## would call it a prayer.
My wish was granted.
You told me you had destroyed my painting.
I was wrong.
It has destroyed me.
It has the eyes of a devil.
Each of us has heaven and hell in him.
If this is true, if this is what you've done with your life, it is far worse than anything said of you.
Do you know how to pray, Dorian?
What is it we were taught to say in our boyhood- lead us not into temptation, forgive us our sins, wash away our iniquities.
Let us say them together.
It's too late, Basil.
The prayer of your pride was answered.
The prayer of your repentance may be answered also.
Do you think
I haven't tried?
I tell you, it's no use.
Isn't there a verse somewhere-
"though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them white as snow"?
Only last week,
Gladys recalled the day this painting was finished.
She remembered putting her initial under my signature.
There it is, just as she made it.
If she could see it now.
I can still pray,
Dorian, if you can't.
Gladys must never know, yet sometime, somehow,
Basil might reveal his secret to her, the one person in the world whose good opinion was indispensable to him.
An uncontrollable feeling of hatred for Basil came over him, together with a terror of the knowledge he had given him and the use he might make of it.
Panic seized him.
He felt like a hunted animal- cornered, desperate.
Oh!
It was as if the painting had sweated a dew of blood.
He felt that he had struck a mortal blow not only at his friend, but at himself.
It seemed to him unbearable that what he had done could never be undone.
Basil was dead.
Men were strangled in england for what he had done, and yet, what evidence was there against him?
Basil had left the house at 11:00.
No one had seen him come in again.
Most of the servants were at selby.
His valet had gone to bed.
Paris! It was to Paris that Basil had gone, by the midnight train, as he had intended.
I'm sorry to wake you, francis.
I forgot my latchkey.
What time is it?
Half past 12:00, sir.
Wake me at 9:00 in the morning.
I have work to do.
Yes, sir.
Did anyone call this evening?
Mr. Hallward, sir.
He stayed till 11:00 and then went to catch his train.
He was leaving for Paris.
Did he leave any message?
He said he would write you from Paris if he didn't find you at your club.
Thank you, francis.
Is there anything more, sir?
I'm writing a letter.
Deliver it early in the morning to mr. Allen campbell.
You'll find the address on the envelope.
Yes, sir.
Good night, sir.
When allen campbell received his letter, he would come.
He would come at once.
Allen would help him.
He was the only one who could " help him.
But what if allen campbell should be out of england?
Days would pass before he could come.
Perhaps he would refuse to come.
Mr. Allen campbell, sir.
This is kind of you, allen.
You said it was a matter of life and death.
Listen to this.
"I sent my soul through the invisible,
"some letter of that after-life to spell:
"And by and by my soul returned to me,
"I myself am heaven and hell."
That's quite good, don't you think?
I didn't come to discuss the verses of omar khayyam.
Of course not.
Please sit down.
I'll tell you why I sent for you.
In a locked room at the top of this house, a room to which no one but myself has access, a dead man is lying across a table.
He's been dead 10 hours.
Who he is, why he died, are matters that do not concern you.
What you must do- there's no need for you to go on.
Your horrible secrets don't interest me.
They'll have to interest you.
You are the one man who is able to save me.
I've seen your name in scientific reviews in connection with certain experiments.
What has that to do with you?
You have got to destroy the thing upstairs- destroy it so that not a vestige is left.
Nobody saw this person come into the house.
When he is missed, not a trace of him must be found here.
Change him and everything that belongs to him, including his coat and his traveling bag, into a handful of ashes.
You must be insane to suppose I'd lift a finger to help you.
It was suicide.
What drove him to it?
You won't do this for me?
How can you ask me, of all men, to mix myself up in this horror?
Allen, it was murder.
I killed him.
He was responsible for the ruin of my life.
He didn't intend it, but the result was the same.
You are certain to be caught.
No man commits a crime without doing something stupid.
I'll have no part of it.
We were friends once, allen.
I regret that.
If you don't help me,
I am lost.
They will hang me.
Let them.
You refuse?
Yes.
I entreat you.
It's useless.
I'm sorry, allen.
You leave me no alternative.
I've written a letter.
Here it is.
You see the address.
If you don't help me,
I must send it.
If you don't help me, i! Will
"send it.
You know what the result will be.
The thing is quite simple, allen.
It would kill her.
I didn't think you would want her name involved in such a scandal.
I cannot do it.
You have no choice.
I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.
You've saved my life.
Dorian dined that evening with lady narborough, who had what Lord Henry described as the remains of a really remarkable ugliness.
You left early last night,
Dorian.
Did you go home or to the club?
Why are you so inquisitive?
I came in at 12:30.
If you want corroborative evidence, you can ask my man.
Two hours unaccounted for,
Dorian.
I suspect they'll bear investigation- or perhaps they will not.
You've hardly touched my dinner.
I believe you're in love.
I haven't been in love for a week, not since madame de ferrol left town.
She's a wonderful woman.
When her third husband died, her hair turned gold.
Husbands of beautiful women belong to the criminal classes.
The world says you're wicked.
What world says that?
It can only be the## next world.
Everyone I know says he's wicked.
It's monstrous the way people go about saying things behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.
Women love us for our defects.
If we have enough of them, they forgive us anything.
No one will persuade me that mr. Gray is wicked.
I shall never forgive him for remaining a bachelor.
Shouldn't we find him a wife, Lord Henry?
I'm always telling him so.
I shall go through debrett and draw out a list of eligible young ladies.
With their ages?
Only slightly edited.
I want it to be a suitable alliance.
I shall save you the trouble of looking.
I have chosen her, if she will have me.
I don't believe it.
Gladys, darling, will you marry me?
Of course I will, darling.
This is the only marriage
I've ever approved of.
How terribly exciting!
I congratulate you both.
For months, the mysterious disappearance of Basil Hallward was the sensation of London.
You don't mind if
I work while we talk?
Not at all.
It's an urgent matter.
Tell me what you discovered in france.
Nothing at all.
We hunted up everyone acquainted with my uncle.
Not one had seen him.
The Paris police don't believe he arrived in france.
Here at scotland yard, we're equally convinced he did leave London.
The man in the gray ulster who boarded at victoria station was undoubtedly
Basil Hallward.
What are we to do now?
You're both young.
I understand you're engaged to marry.
Go on with your own lives peacefully.
Believe me, that's the best course.
Scotland yard will not forget Basil Hallward.
I thought Gladys should go away for a while.
I'm going to my country place at selby tomorrow.
Gladys will join me with friends on thursday.
We'd be delighted if you'd join us.
I can't get away, but I'm glad you're going.
The diversion will do you good.
Thank you, sir robert.
You've been very kind.
Not at all.
Mr. Gray, are you acquainted with a young man named allen campbell?
Yes. At one time, we were great friends.
It's been a long time since I've seen him.
Why do you ask?
I've just received a tragic notice.
This morning, allen campbell died by his own hand.
Why on earth should allen campbell...
I thought you might give me a clue.
He had everything to live for.
He was achieving a name for himself in science.
He left no note, no letter, no explanation?
None. Whatever drove him to it, he took the secret with him.
How little we really know what goes on inside a man.
Yes.
You've been sad all evening.
Is it allen campbell?
Perhaps.
I'm sorry.
Let's be married soon- in a fortnight.
A simple wedding with only our closest friends.
A fortnight?
You call that soon?
Good night, darling.
I'll come to selby on the thursday train with janet.
I'll be at the station.
Allen campbell.
Would allen's blood be on the painting now?
There were other roads to forgetfulness than the one that allen took.
Where to, sir?
Blue gate fields.
Yes, sir.
One day, we shall be awakened with suffering and dismay to the realization that the soul is not a superstition nor the spirit of man a material substance that can be viewed under a microscope.
The eternal words are as true today as when he uttered them.
"What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul?"
The soul is not an illusion.
It is a terrible reality.
It can be bought and sold and bartered away.
It can be poisoned or made perfect.
That man, rich or poor, who has the light of faith and charity within himself, even though he were plunged into the very pit of darkness, would still enjoy the clear light of day.
But the wretched creature whose soul is filled with dark thoughts and foul deeds must dwell in darkness even though he walk under the noonday sun.
He must carry his own vile dungeon round with him.
What's that you're playing?
It has a name, hasn't it?
A kind of name.
It's called
## prelude.
Play something else.
Why you like that music?
I heard someone play that piece before...
18 years ago.
A woman?
Every time I get back to London,
I look for him.
Sir tristan, my sister called him, because he was like a knight.
If he was in rangoon or valparaiso,
I'd find him, but in London it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I don't know his real name.
I don't even know what he looks like.
When you find him, what will you do?
Maybe he's dead already.
Did you think of that?
I'll keep on looking.
You're not english.
What is "english"?
There are men, and there are women.
This is sir tristan, kate, darling.
Don't call me that, adrian.
I heard Lord Henry call you sir tristan.
At the time,
I thought it fit.
Why don't we see you?
I have all I need here- drink and drugs and no friends.
I had too many friends.
Oh, he's drawing a picture of you, sir.
Come and look at it.
What would you like- a song, poem, painting?
I do all three surpassingly well.
It seems to me there's something lacking.
I have it.
But grim to see... is a gallows tree.
Good-bye, adrian.
And green or dry, a man must die before it bears its fruit.
Good-bye, sir tristan.
What did you call him?
Sit down.
I'll draw your picture for the price of three drinks... four drinks.
Sir tristan, you said.
And sir tristan rode forth into the forest, seeking his only love.
He has gone to kill your friend.
Justice has come to england... without wig or gown.
Come on, kate.
If it's money you want-
I'm sibyl vane's brother.
Does that mean anything to you?
No, nothing.
Why are you called sir tristan?
It happens to be my name.
You're lying. 18 years,
I've been looking for you.
How old do you think I am?
Why didn't you murder him?
They could only have hanged you for it.
He's not the man
I'm looking for.
He's too young.
How old do you think he is?
22, I'd say.
Ha ha ha!
What are you laughing at?
Dorian gray has looked 22 for the last 20 years.
What did you say his name was?
In your case, this strange impulse to be good is merely the effect of your approaching marriage.
It'll wear off.
Would you pull that blind?
The truth is,
I want to be better.
At least it will be a novel sensation.
It needn't become a habit.
Marriage is a habit- a bad habit.
I trust it won't make you a hopelessly reformed character.
What are people talking about in London?
They were talking about
Basil's disappearance.
Now they're taken up with allen campbell's suicide.
What do you think happened to Basil?
I suppose we shall be told that he's been seen in san francisco.
Everyone who disappears is said to be seen in san francisco.
It must be a delightful city.
He was a fine painter,
I'm certain.
The best thing
Basil did was that wonderful portrait of you.
What is your secret?
You don't look a day older than you did when that portrait was painted.
Perhaps I'll tell you someday.
To get back my youth,
I'd do anything except get up early, exercise, or be respectable.
I sometimes think
I'd give anything if I could change and grow old.
My good resolutions may have come too late.
Though Dorian placed guards about the estate, the consciousness of being hunted, snared, tracked down began to dominate him.
In the small hours of the night, when every sound is seized upon by the distraught imagination, remorse and terror laid hold of him.
Each detail of his crimes came back to him in nightmares with added horror, haunting him relentlessly with the living death of his soul.
With the day came the cruel necessity to dissemble to Gladys and to his guests.
Have you had good sport?
Not very good.
The birds have gone to the open.
It may be better after lunch.
Don't shoot it, geoffrey.
Nonsense!
I've hit a beater!
The idiot got in front of the gun.
Stop shooting!
A man's hurt!
Sir, where is he?
Here. Why on earth don't you keep your men back?
Spoiled my shooting for the day.
I've told them the shooting's stopped for today.
It wouldn't look well to go on.
Is the man- he's dead. He received the charge in his chest.
Thornton. Come in.
I suppose you've come about the accident.
Was he married?
Did he have dependents?
I'll write them any sum you think necessary.
We don't know him.
That's why
I came to you.
Wasn't he one of your men?
Never saw him before.
Seems like a sailor.
A sailor?
Looks as if he'd been a sort of sailor- tattooed on both arms.
Wasn't anything found on him that would tell his names?
Money-not much- and a six-shooter.
No name of any kind.
Decent-looking man, but rough-like.
Sort of sailor, we think.
Where is the body?
In an empty stable at the home farm.
Show me his face.
Come in.
What is it, Dorian?
Oh, but you haven't changed.
You'll be late for dinner.
I wanted to look at you.
I know, darling.
I've felt that way so often about you.
Good-bye, Gladys.
Good-bye?
Until half past 8:00.
Until half past 8:00.
Go on.
Shall I go on, sir?
Yes.
Dorian!
David, what brings you to selby?
Have you seen Dorian?
What is it?
What's happened?
Dorian's gone to London.
Didn't you know?
David passed him on his way from the station.
He looked black as thunder.
I thought he'd found out what I'd been up to.
What have you been up to?
You'll put it down to jealousy.
I don't deny jealousy's mixed up in it.
I had a dreadful presentiment.
When you announced the marriage,
I grew desperate to stop it.
What is it you've done, david?
There's a locked room in Dorian's house.
I didn't attach any importance to it at first.
He could have locked up anything.
Then one of Dorian's valets came to see me about a position.
It struck me how often Dorian changed his servants.
This one told me
Dorian locked himself in that room at all hours.
One night, he heard a noise and went to investigate.
Dorian came out and looked at him as if he could kill him, he said.
He accused him of spying and sacked him.
I felt if I could get into that room,
I might find something to stop this marriage.
And did you get in?
I bribed one of the servants to get me an impression of the lock.
Here's the key.
I waited until Dorian came down here to selby and then let myself in.
I know you'll despise me for stooping to this, but it doesn't matter what you think of me if I can stop you from marrying him.
What did you find in the room?
Nothing, really.
It's an old schoolroom with books and a portrait with a covering.
Portrait? Of whom?
I don't know.
The original must be a monstrous person, if an original exists.
Has a vague family resemblance to Dorian- a sort of middle-aged, mad, gruesome uncle with a debauched face and blood all over it.
Your uncle painted it.
My uncle never painted such a picture.
He signed it.
I'd been counting so much on finding something to help me that I decided I'd been doing Dorian an injustice.
I had an impulse to come here and make a clean breast of it, give you my blessing and ask your forgiveness.
Describe the portrait in greater detail.
There's a curious cat, like the one in
Dorian's drawing room, only in the portrait the eyes shine in an evil way that's indescribable.
Did you notice anything unusual about the signature?
No,
I don't think so.
Now that I see you,
Gladys,
I can't say what I intended to.
I know that this marriage is wrong.
There's something strange and evil in Dorian.
Was there a letter "g" under the signature on that painting, david, like this?
I believe there was.
How did you know?
Yes, gibson?
Mr. Gray asked me to bring you this letter when I got back from the station.
He said I must give it to you in person.
Once I said that if I were to marry you, it would be an incredible wickedness.
You thought it was a way of saying
I didn't love you.
I do love you, more than anything in the world, but I only bring disaster on those who love me.
If you knew how I've already wronged you, you would turn from me in horror.
You will never see me again.
Try to remember me, dear Gladys, without bitterness.
This is the only good thing
I have ever done.
Won't you tell us what it is?
Perhaps we can help you.
We must go to London at once.
Was it true that one could never change?
He longed for the unstained purity of his youth, before he had prayed in a monstrous moment of pride and passion that the painting should bear the burden of the years and of his corruption.
Sibyl vane was dead, and now her brother would be hidden in a nameless grave.
Allen campbell had shot himself, and Basil... nothing could alter that.
It was of the future that he must think.
He had spared Gladys.
Would there be any sign of his one good deed in the portrait?
It was there- almost imperceptible, but surely it was there in the eyes, struggling through the horror and the loathsomeness.
There was hope for him, then.
He would go away, leave england forever, live obscurely in a distant country, find peace in a life of humility and self-denial.
He would expel every sign of evil from the painted face.
He would watch the hideousness fade and change.
But the painting would always be there to tempt his weakness.
Better to destroy it, to grow old inevitably as all men grow old.
If he fell into evil ways, to be punished as all men are punished.
Better if each sin of his life were to breed sure, swift penalty.
The knife that had killed
Basil Hallward would kill his portrait also and free him at a stroke from the evil enchantment of the past.
But when the knife pierced the heart of the portrait, an extraordinary thing happened.
Father, forgive me, for I have sinned.
Father, forgive me, for I have sinned.
Through my fault, through my most grievous fault.
Heaven forgive me.
Take Gladys home, david.
Come here, children.
Come closer. Take a good look.
It may seem just a little valley with a little stream running through it.
But no, there are songs and stories...
...and lovely legends about this one blessed spot.
It's Sleepy Hollow.
Just because you happen to be the kindergarten class...
...in the very favored village of Tarrytown...
...you may run and play in Sleepy Hollow...
...for exactly 15 minutes.
Look, a kitty.
So this will be the shoe.
You mustn't let Evelynn catch you with it, or you'll be it.
- Ready?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Go.
Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe
Get it done by half past 2
- Dorothy.
- No, I haven't got it.
Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe
Get it done by half past 2
Amy.
She's dreaming again. Amy, you're it.
- She's kicking me.
- Ready, Amy?
We never have any fun with Amy.
- She spoils everything.
- I'm sure she doesn't mean to.
Amy is a nice girl, only a little different.
Oh, my beautiful.
You are my friend.
Come play with me.
Amy.
I'll get it for you, Amy.
I'll get it for you.
I'll get it.
Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about.
- After all, it was only a slap.
- That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed.
He insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Ms. Callahan.
I know it may seem stupid of me...
...but it's not the slap
I'm worried about. It's the reason.
Something to do with a butterfly.
They were quarreling about it.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he hurt the butterfly.
- It was her friend.
- Well, that seems a harmless fancy.
Amy has too many fancies and too few friends, and it worries me.
It doesn't seem normal.
You know these fond fathers with their only chicks.
I can see that you're worried, and Amy is a very sensitive...
...and delicately adjusted child.
But part of the blame for that may lie with you.
Perhaps you're overanxious, watch her too closely, worry too much.
The child's bound to feel it.
It's late, Mommy. You haven't forgotten my birthday party.
- No, darling.
- Your birthday, Amy.
And I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Mommy's having a party for me, and I invited Robert and Lois...
Amy and I will meet you at the car.
And Evelynn and Betty and Ruth...
Look at these, Ollie. Aren't they cute?
There must be one of Amy's here.
Oh, here it is.
She doesn't seem to have inherited...
...any artistic abilities from either of us.
Well, it shows imagination anyhow.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her.
I'm sure I don't, Alice. It's something else.
Something moody. Something sickly.
- She could almost be Irena's child.
- But she's not Irena's child.
There's nothing of Irena in her.
She's my child.
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes.
Deep and blue...
- ...like yours.
- I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
- I know that.
- That's why I can tell you...
...that you think too much about Irena.
Blame yourself too much for her death.
No, it's not that. It's because...
...I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves, imagine things.
I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where...
...butterflies become pals.
I saw what happened to Irena with her cat people.
I know, dear. I understand.
But try not to worry so much about her.
Be a little easier in your thinking.
Especially today, let's forget about it.
Better hurry. I left Amy in the car, and she's getting impatient.
She says there's something important about a 6th birthday.
We'll see that she gets there in good time.
I'm so happy to have met you, Ms. Callahan.
You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.
- I do hope you'll come to see us.
- Thank you, I will.
- Goodbye, Mr. Reed.
- Goodbye, Ms. Callahan.
- Where is everybody?
- It's early yet.
It's nearly quarter after 4.
The party was 4:00, wasn't it?
- Yes, darling.
- Gosh.
In my days, the kids arrived at birthday parties...
- ...before anybody was ready for them.
- Times have changed.
Ollie, that's for the children to play with.
No kids yet.
Something's gone wrong.
Maybe I should call somebody.
All right, Ollie. Go ahead.
Call the Millers.
See if their darling Donald has left yet.
- I think I should. Three thousand W?
- That's right.
What is it, Ollie?
- Something's haywire.
- What?
Neither the Millers nor the Irvings received invitations.
But they must have.
Amy and I made them out together.
You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Ma'am, the truth is,
I gave them to Amy herself to post.
- Amy mailed them?
- She pleaded so to do it.
Amy.
Remember the invitations that Edward gave you to mail?
- Yes, Daddy.
- Did you mail them?
- Yes, I did.
- Where did you mail them?
I'll show you.
Amy. Not that old tree.
Yes, Daddy.
But I told you about that so long ago.
You couldn't have been more than 3 when
I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
- I didn't forget.
- But, Amy...
...that wasn't real. That was just a story.
That tree's no mailbox.
Well, there they are.
Look, Amy...
...Mom and Dad keep telling you over and over again...
...but you go right on dreaming. And then...
...things like this happen.
If the invitations didn't go...
...then that means nobody will come, doesn't it?
There won't be any party.
Oh, yes.
There is gonna be a party.
We'll have one ourselves.
You and I and Mother and Edward, huh?
Oh, Amy, look, isn't that beautiful?
Oh, boy, I bet that tastes good.
- You got to blow them all out at once.
- Amy, make a wish.
Wish real hard, blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
- But wishes don't come true.
- Certain wishes do.
You told me in the garden that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
Well, this is different. Go on, blow.
Oh, Amy, you'll get your wish.
You know what I wished, Daddy?
I wished I could be a good girl.
Now it's all ruined.
You shouldn't speak your wish.
But, Edward...
...with this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
I can make this sort of a wish come true.
I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be.
Play with the other children...
...not sit around by myself...
- ...tell the truth.
- That's right, darling.
And you'll make Mommy and Daddy very happy.
- Good morning, Edward.
- Good morning, Amy.
Hello, Jack.
Look who's coming.
- What comes next?
- Double knocks, of course.
I just seem to stay in double knocks forever.
It's very hard to do anything with somebody breathing down your neck.
May I play too?
You might just as well stop being nice to us, Amy Reed.
- We're mad at you.
- Why?
Because you said you were going to invite us to your birthday party.
- And you didn't.
- But I did. I did invite you.
Look at the giraffe.
Look at the giraffe.
Run faster.
Run! Run faster!
Ditch her!
I did invite you to my party.
I did, I did, I did.
We ditched her. Serves her right.
- The old house.
- It's haunted.
There's a witch in it.
Count three, count four, run past the door
That's the best thing to say for witches.
Little girl. Come into the garden.
It's pleasant and cool here.
Come into the garden.
Little girl.
Step back, away from the house...
...so that I can see you.
Give me that.
Go away, little girl. Go away.
- May I have my milk, Edward?
- Certainly, little miss.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Look at my ring.
- That's a fine-looking ring.
- A lady threw it to me.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
It's a pretty ring.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Maybe. If it's a real morning ring like we have in Jamaica...
...all you've got to do is turn it on your finger...
- ...close your eyes and make a wish.
- If it's a real morning ring...
...I'm going to think hard for something I want...
...more than anything in the world before I wish.
That's the clever way to do it.
You look good and hot and good and tired.
You played real hard with your friends?
I didn't play, Edward.
They wouldn't play with me.
Your daddy isn't going to like that.
He had his heart all set on your playing with the other children.
I'd better tell him.
Daddy.
Amy, come over here and take a look at this.
Your daddy is so pleased with you...
...that he's built you a model ship for your very own.
You see, when you're a good girl and play with the other children...
...don't go moping and dreaming by yourself...
...your daddy wants to do everything he can to make you happy.
Now, you run along and find the other children.
I wanted to talk to you.
I wanted to tell you about the other children.
- Can't you tell me later?
- I didn't play with them.
They wouldn't play with me.
What do you mean?
They wouldn't play with me on account of the birthday party.
Because you didn't ask them?
I don't blame them for being angry.
- Why didn't you explain what happened?
- They ran away.
- Why didn't you run after them?
- I did.
I came to an old, dark house...
...and a voice called to me.
- A lovely sweet voice.
- Now, Amy...
- It's true.
- Who did the voice belong to?
- It was just a voice.
- Now, look, this is the last time...
...you come to me with such stories.
I'm sick of this thing.
- But it's true.
- Let me be the judge of that.
Old, dark houses and voices.
Run out and play with the other children and never let me hear that again.
Your mother may excuse it as imagination, but I call it plain lying...
...I'll have none of it. Understand?
My, my, what a coil we're in.
- What's this all about?
- Oh, Amy's been lying again.
No, I didn't.
Voices from an old, dark house.
Did you hear the child out?
- Well, it seemed to me that...
- You mean you didn't.
Seems to me the least you could do.
You can't jump at conclusions that way.
- I think you're being unfair.
- I'm never unfair.
- Ollie, you're shouting at me.
- I'm not shouting at you.
But there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child.
I'm sorry, darling.
Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
You're upset about me.
I made you fight.
I hate for you to fight.
We're not really fighting, darling.
We're just having a little discussion.
You run out and play, and we'll make up. Go on, now.
I wish...
...for a friend.
Amy looks happy. Looks almost as if she were playing with another child.
Like somebody else were running with her and playing.
Well, nothing wrong with your appetite, is there?
- I didn't have to coax her tonight.
- She made a promise...
- ...and she's keeping it. Aren't you?
- Yes.
- Saw the way she played this afternoon.
- Indeed, I did.
Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
I wasn't singing to myself.
I suppose it was to the wind you sang.
Or maybe to the clouds or the sun.
Or perhaps it was to the flowers in the garden.
All finished, darling?
- Yes, Mommy.
- All right, come along, then.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, darling.
- Pleasant dreams.
- Same to you.
She'll surely have pleasant dreams tonight.
She's been such a good girl all day long.
- What are you saying, darling?
- I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, sounds like a song...
...if you hold on to it long enough.
I thought I'd never forget that song.
- What song, dear?
- The song I was trying to hum.
The song my friend taught me.
You'll remember it sometime.
- Mommy.
- Yes, darling.
- Did you ever make a wish?
- Lots of times.
- Did your wishes ever come true?
- Sometimes.
I made a wish today, and it came true, just like Edward said it would.
- Where did you get this ring?
- That's what I wished on.
- Edward says it's a wishing ring, and it is.
- But where did you get it?
At the old house with the voice.
Someone gave it you?
But you shouldn't accept gifts from strangers.
Yes, Mommy.
Where was this old house?
On the back street. A green house.
- The Farren house.
- Do you know the people?
No, I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
- Are they nice?
- I really don't know.
But I do know that you must return the ring.
Get Edward to take you there and give it back to the old lady.
Well, the mother or daughter, whichever one gave it you.
But ask Edward to go with you.
I'll take it back.
I got my wish anyway.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
Then you must keep it true.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
I want to talk to you.
Mommy says for you to come to the old house with me.
I've got to take back this ring.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships off for your dad.
- Will you come soon?
- Soon as I finish.
- Now, little miss?
- You're going to be busy all day long.
I do suppose so...
...but since you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
That means I can go alone?
- Hello, Amy.
- Hello.
Were you coming to see us, Ms. Callahan?
- No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
- I live right here.
Well, maybe I'll drop in and see your mommy.
- Goodbye, Ms. Callahan.
- Goodbye, Amy.
I like to see a home like this.
A home connected with people's thoughts and work. Things they love.
- This is some of Oliver's handiwork.
- Good too.
- It was fun getting this room together.
- I should think so.
It doesn't fit, does it?
Yet it's a part of our lives too.
A part of our past.
I've often thought of getting rid of it, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.
It was his first wife's favorite picture.
She was an artist.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
Yes, he was.
As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday.
It was a tragic, terrible experience.
Oliver's never really gotten over it.
- What is it?
- My mother told me to give back...
...the ring to the lady who gave it to me.
You're not the lady.
Sit over there.
I quite agree with you. The sun is not kind.
God should use a rose-amber spot.
Come along.
Here we go.
Sit down, my child.
I've been watching you.
You couldn't see me, but I could see you.
It was like peeking through the slit in the curtain...
...before the play began.
You'd be a very good audience.
I can see that.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring...
...my mother says
I have to give it back to you.
Return it to me? Indeed you may not.
I gave it to you as a present.
But my mother says
I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger?
Why, I've played every theater from Boston to San Francisco.
I've played London, Paris.
Those days.
Those beautiful, shining, golden days.
But I only came to give back the ring.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Let's have some tea, shall we?
Tea will be good...
...strong and red now, the way I like it.
She's always spying on me.
She creeps into the room.
- She lives here.
- Who is she?
That woman is an impostor.
She's a liar and a cheat.
- How do you like your tea?
- Sometimes I get a spoonful...
...of tea in a cup of hot milk.
Good.
It's almost as if there were a curse on us.
I wouldn't care if it were on me, but it seems to be directed against Amy.
I sometimes think Irena haunts this house.
Why, Edward...
...I thought you'd gone with Amy.
No, she went to some old house she was talking about yesterday.
That's the Farren house.
Is that where she got the ring?
She shouldn't be up there.
- But I told her to go with you.
- She said something about that...
...but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll go right over.
Child, have you ever seen a play?
- I like stories.
- Then I'll tell you a story.
A lovely story.
Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
My mommy read it to me.
Do you know the story of The Headless Horseman?
You live right here in Tarrytown...
...and don't know the legend of Sleepy Hollow?
Then you must hear it.
I shall tell it to you.
There. Now, you sit there.
Now, we'll pretend this is the stage.
The Headless Horseman.
Why hasn't he got a head?
It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here.
With the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
There's a knocking at the south entry.
Knock, knock. Never a quiet.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking.
Is my little miss here?
A little girl with hair about the color of yours, ma'am?
About time for you to come home, Amy.
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
Let the child stay.
Now, I don't know, Amy.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren.
He'll let me stay.
- Good.
- Now, Amy, I didn't say.
On the dark nights...
...on the stormy nights, you can hear him.
He passes like the wind...
...and the flapping and fluttering of his great cloak...
...beating like gaunt wings.
And the thunder of his horse's hooves...
...is loud and loud...
...and louder.
At the midnight hour...
...down the road that leads to Sleepy Hollow...
...across the bridge, he goes galloping...
...galloping, galloping.
Always searching, always seeking.
And if you stand on the bridge at the wrong hour...
...the hour when he rides by...
...his great cloak sweeps around you.
He swings you to his saddlebow.
And then forever you must ride.
And always his cold arms around you...
...clasping you into the cavity of his bony chest.
And then, forever you must ride...
...and ride and ride...
...with the Headless Horseman.
Come along now.
I've had a nice time, but I have to go home now. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone.
You gave me a fright, you did.
But she's such a nice lady.
But I don't want you coming here alone.
You get me to go with you when you want to come here.
You promise?
You be sure of your promise.
A liar, an impostor.
Your own daughter.
You called me that.
Yet you're sweet and kind to the little girl. A stranger.
Look at me. I'm your daughter.
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was 6.
That was long ago.
You're only the woman who takes care of me.
Look at me.
You are an impostor.
He passes like the wind.
Riding, riding, riding, riding.
His cold arms around you.
Loud and louder and louder.
Loud and louder.
- Listen.
- What is it, Alice?
I thought I heard Amy calling.
I guess not.
My friend.
I'm frightened.
My friend.
I'm glad you came.
My friend.
Sing me that song again.
My friend.
He's a million miles away.
Gathering a few aces, I hope. Ollie.
- What?
- It's your play.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was somewhere else.
- Good morning, Mommy.
- Good morning, darling.
You ready for breakfast?
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
I haven't had mine.
- Well, you know where it is.
- You see the way I'm treated?
You're the only one who has any pull around here.
Mommy, who's this?
- Amy, where did you get this?
- Right in here.
- Isn't she pretty?
- She was very pretty.
- What's her name?
- Irena.
Irena.
Darling, look, the sun's shining.
Why don't you run out and play.
All right, Mommy.
- Ollie.
- Yeah.
Don't you think we ought to get rid of this?
- Where did you get it?
- Amy found it in that drawer.
You better go through the whole bunch.
There may be others of Irena in there.
I hope we never have to tell Amy about her.
There's no need to that I can see.
Irena.
Irena.
Who are you?
You called me by my name.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend too.
I've been lonely.
But where do you come from?
You wouldn't understand.
I come from great darkness...
...and deep peace.
But where is that?
I cannot tell you.
Will you be my friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
For always, then.
But you must promise never to tell anyone about me.
Not even Daddy or Mommy?
No.
This must be a friendship that only we shall have.
You and I.
Amy and her friend.
Oh, I like the sound of that.
Amy and her friend.
Amy and her friend.
One...
...is like a tall princess.
- A princess.
- Of course.
And two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
Yes. Yes.
- The prince.
- That's right.
- This is more fun than just numbers.
- Of course.
There's an oak leaf and a maple.
That one's an elm.
Throw seaweeds into the flames...
...and the fire turns blue.
I don't think that's much fun.
Let's play house instead.
You be the friend who comes to see me.
I'll show you my children.
Your children?
My dolls.
- We can pretend.
- All right, Amy.
Button your sweater, darling.
It's turning cold.
Yes. Winter's coming.
I don't like the winter.
Oh, but winter's fun.
There's the wind...
...and the snow.
You will like the warm fire upon the hearth...
...and the long, long nights.
All my children are taking their naps.
We must be very quiet.
This is Lottie.
She's very good.
This is Mary Ann.
She's good sometimes.
This is Virginia.
She's hardly ever good.
These are all from me.
- Oh.
- Why, Amy.
Let's see what we have here.
"To Mother from Amy."
- Thank you, darling.
- You can't open them yet.
You have to put them under the tree until morning.
- All right, dear.
- I guess if you can wait, so can we.
Let's see. "To Daddy from Amy."
Here's one for Ms. Callahan, and...
- ..."To Edward from Amy."
- Good heavens.
- What could you be giving me, little miss?
- You just wait.
- This one's for Mrs. Farren.
- She gave me a ring...
...so I'm giving her a ring.
I paid 25 cents for it too.
This one hasn't got a name on it.
Why, Amy. Who gets this one?
Who's it for, Amy?
Do we have to guess?
Come on, tell us who it's for.
Ollie, ask them in.
- Merry Christmas. Come on in.
- Thank you.
Put them down someplace.
- Your carols were beautiful.
- Oh, well, thank you.
It's so cold out there, you've no idea.
I could nearly die.
Can I help you?
- Thank you.
- There's a big fire in the living room.
Edward's fixing hot drinks for all.
So bounteous of you. I always said you were a most bounteous young man.
- The sentiment is mutual, Miss Plumett.
- Thank you.
Right in there.
Oh, my dear, Mrs. Reed.
Of all the houses we've been in tonight,
I swear that yours...
...has the truest dyed-in-tradition
Christmas spirit.
Plumett ought to have a record of that.
She says the same thing at every house we go to.
- What did you get for Christmas?
- I don't know yet.
My goodness.
Don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
- No.
- We open ours on Christmas Eve.
That's considered proper.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
Couldn't we have another carol?
Of course you may have another carol.
What shall it be, good friends?
I know one.
"Shepherd, Shake Off Your Drowsy Sleep."
Oh, we know that one.
Come on, everybody.
Come on. Come on.
Now, remember, we start con vivace, you know.
Merry Christmas, Amy.
Merry Christmas, Irena.
I brought you a present.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
You can open it now, I guess.
Lois Huggins says that's proper.
How beautiful.
It reminded me of you...
...so I bought it.
It cost me more than all the others.
I shall wear it on my cape.
That is more beautiful than I ever imagined.
I wish I could show you to Mommy and Daddy.
I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together.
Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Oh, please.
Look.
Amy.
Amy, where are you?
Amy.
Better go in now.
Run along, darling.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you, Amy.
Come in, my child.
Sit over there.
You sit there.
I brought you a present.
- Merry Christmas.
- Christmas present.
It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
There's a present you haven't opened yet.
That's from her. That woman.
Well, let's see what we have here.
In my time, I've had a great many presents.
Christmas and otherwise.
The king of Spain gave me that ring.
Oh, a ring.
A beautiful ring.
See how it shines.
What would I do with the king of Spain's ring...
...when I have this to put in its place.
For this...
This is a ring given me out of friendship and love.
Thank you, my child.
It's getting late. We'd better be going on.
The family will be waiting.
Such a brief visit.
But, dear child...
...you've made my Christmas a very happy one.
Merry Christmas.
You didn't even open my present.
And I'm your daughter.
My daughter died...
...long ago.
Dismantling a Christmas tree always makes me a little sad.
Cheer up. It'll be on us again before you know it. Amy...
...here, take these and put them on the fire.
- Isn't it fun to hear them crackle, Amy?
- I like it.
I love the smell of pine.
It's one of my clearest memories.
Twelfth night...
...burning pine and mummer's plays.
Been ages since I've even thought of a mummer's play.
We used to do them every year in college.
St. George and the dragon.
All kinds of crazy sword dances.
I even have pictures of myself.
All done up in tattered green, waving a wooden sword. They're in here.
- Here we go again.
- Quiet.
- What did I lose?
- I'll get it, Mommy.
Daddy.
Yes, Amy.
Why, Daddy, you know my friend too.
You couldn't know this woman.
She died before you were born.
Why did you call her your friend?
Answer me, Amy.
Why did you call her your friend?
Because she is my friend.
Ollie, please. Let's not go on with this.
The child's trembling.
We've got to go on.
Amy, all this time, you've let your mother and father think...
...that you've forgotten that old dream life of yours.
- Now we find you've only kept it secret.
- It isn't a secret.
She plays with me.
She plays with me in the garden all the time.
Right out there in the garden. She does.
In the garden?
Would she be there now?
She's there whenever I call her.
Now, Amy...
...I want you to look all around very carefully.
Then I want you to tell me if your friend is in the garden now.
Do you understand, Amy?
- She's there.
- Where, Amy?
Right there, under the tree.
Amy, there's nothing there.
There's no one at all in the garden.
But she is there.
Listen, darling,
I want you to look once more.
Take as long as you want.
Look very carefully.
Then I want you to tell me there's no one there.
- But she is there.
- I tell you, there's no one there.
If you deny that, if you insist that this...
...woman you call your friend is in the garden...
...I'm afraid I shall have to punish you.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
All right, Amy.
Now...
...tell me what you see.
I see Irena.
Amy's never been punished before.
- Not that way.
- It's best for you not to interfere.
I suppose so.
- I'm sorry to make such a fool of myself.
- After all, a first spanking...
...it's an important occasion.
I'll be all right in a minute.
I'll duck into the kitchen and see what's happened to Edward and the coffee.
When children are playing alone on the green
In comes the playmate that never was seen.
- What did you say?
- I was starting a poem.
Stevenson's "Unseen Playmate."
You probably know it.
When children are playing alone on the green
In comes the playmate that never was seen
When children are happy and lonely and good
The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood
- I know it.
- You liked it, didn't you?
I like it now.
Don't you see it's the same thing?
Amy isn't lying to you.
It's an unseen companion.
- Children love to dream things up.
- This is different.
This is worse.
It isn't just a childish fancy.
It couldn't be anything else.
You see, I've lived through something like this before.
I was married to the very woman that Amy claims as a friend...
- ...whose picture she identified.
- That's so easy to understand.
She'd seen the picture, had liked the face...
...and made it a part of this companion she imagined.
You don't know about this woman.
My first wife, Irena.
You don't know what happened to her.
She told lies to herself and believed them.
I tried to stop it...
...but everything I did was wrong.
In the end, she went completely mad.
There was a terrible tragedy.
She killed a man...
...then she killed herself.
It must have been terrible for you.
But you can't let this stand between you and your child.
Amy.
Do you know why I came to you, Amy?
Why I came to be your friend?
Because you called to me.
Out of your loneliness, you called me...
...and brought me into being.
And I came...
...so that your childhood could be bright...
...and full of friendliness.
Now...
...you must send me away.
I don't want you to leave.
You'll remember me for a while...
...mourn a little.
But then you'll forget.
And that is as it should be.
I'll never forget you.
If you leave, I'll follow you.
No one can follow me.
Don't go. Don't leave me.
Goodbye.
Please don't leave me.
Don't go, please.
Come back, Irena.
Irena.
But you're a teacher, not a parent.
- You haven't any children.
- Wait a minute. You design ships.
That's your business.
You have no special qualifications...
...to handle children, other than parenthood.
I'm a teacher. I've studied children.
- What do the books tell you about Amy?
- Just one book.
It's called The Inner Life of Childhood.
There's a whole chapter devoted to children like Amy.
Unhappy and frustrated.
Children have only one way of escape.
They build companions for themselves.
Some children believe they have a dog or a cat.
Others create children or grownups for their friend.
That's an indication of how serious it is with Amy.
You see, you agree with me.
I have every right to be worried.
I've never argued that. It's just you're going about it the wrong way.
I still find that hard to believe.
Irena.
Irena.
You've got to be her friend so that she won't need other friends.
You've got to believe what she says.
Her friend will vanish the moment her hunger for friendship...
...is satisfied by a real person.
- You're talking about Amy?
- Yes.
I want to trust her.
I want to be her friend.
There's no better time than now.
She's probably upstairs this minute, sobbing out her grief...
...to a friend who doesn't even exist.
Ollie, why don't you go up to her.
Well...
...I'll go up and see if she's gotten to bed all right.
Irena.
- Ollie, what is it?
- Amy. She's gone.
Operator. Give me the state police in a hurry.
She's gone into the woods.
And if you stand on the bridge at the wrong hour...
...the hour when he rides by...
...his great cloak sweeps around you...
I hate this storm. I hate it.
I don't hate the storm.
It blows beyond me.
It was on...
...a night like this...
...that Barbara died.
But I'm Barbara. I didn't die.
- Don't you understand?
- My Barbara was killed.
No, no. You were out of your mind.
You didn't know anybody.
You didn't remember anything.
Look at me. Look in my eyes, Mother.
Say that I'm Barbara.
No. It's not true.
Everything you say is a lie.
You are a poor, lost woman.
You're not my Barbara.
You're always worse when that little girl's been here.
If that child comes here again...
...I'll kill her.
Yes, I'll kill her.
- What is it, Johnson?
- The dogs tracked her down to here.
Ollie, they'll find her.
It's a bad night.
If anything happens to her, it's my fault.
They'll find her. You can make it up to her.
I'll make it up to her.
I'll trust and believe her.
We'll have to leave the car here.
She's gone across the field.
Mrs. Farren.
Mrs. Farren.
Mrs. Farren.
Mrs. Farren.
Oh, little girl.
Poor little girl.
I'll have to hide you.
Little girl...
...I have to hide you.
No. We...
We can't hide you there.
She knows every corner of that room.
We can go upstairs.
There's a little room under the eaves.
I can hide you there.
I rarely go upstairs anymore. You'll...
You'll have to help me.
- Hurry, hurry.
- Yes.
Yes.
Hurry.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
Mrs. Farren.
Mrs. Farren.
Even my mother's last moments you've stolen from me.
Come here.
Daddy.
Come here.
My friend.
My friend.
My friend.
My friend.
Amy.
Amy.
Amy.
I thought we'd lost you.
I thought I'd never find you again.
Amy, from now on, you and I are gonna be friends.
I'm going to trust you.
I'm going to believe you.
You'll like that, won't you?
Yes, Daddy.
Is your friend in the garden?
Can you see Irena, now?
Yes. I can see her.
I see her too, darling.

This is a very old fairy tale that was first told many centuries ago and still lives, and everybody tells it in a different way.
People of the Fairy Kingdom, hey, people of the Fairy Kingdom!
The Royal Herald is speaking to you
Can you hear me?
O, what a pleasing message have I to deliver to you!
Everything is prepared for the ball in the Royal Palace.
Dear invitees to the ball, o, dear invitees to the ball!
Do not forget that you are invited!
Something miraculous will certainly happen at the ball.
It is not without a reason that our land is called the Fairy Kingdom.
Do come, do not forget, on my word of honour, you won’t regret it.
The King got up at 5 in the morning he personally dusted the grand staircase,
Then he paid a visit to the kitchen, had a row with the chef, enraged, he relinquished the Crown, but after all tempered justice with mercy and now he is running along the Royal road checking that everything is fine.
There! Can you see him?
- Good day, Mr Forester.
- Good day, Your Majesty.
Forester, I wanted to ask you, why do you shiver and look back all the time in these latter days?
Maybe, there is a monster in the forest, threatening you by mortal danger?
No, Your Majesty, I would kill the monster!
Maybe thieves came to the forest?
Nothing of the sort, Your Majesty! I would fight them off at once!
Maybe an evil wizard haunts you?
No, Your Majesty, I would sort that out!
What drove you to such a condition then?
My wife.
- Really?
Upon my soul, I married a cute woman, but she is harsh.
They twist me round their little fingers!
I mean my spouse and her daughters from her first marriage.
They’ve been getting dressed for the Ball for last three days they have trotted us off our death!
I mean me and my little daughter, who became a stepdaughter because of my weakness...
I am resigning, I will cloister! if such heartrending things can happen in my kingdom!
Live your life on your own!
Shame on you, Forester.
Hush, hush, Sire, if my wife hears you I am dead!
Don’t put the blame on me! My wife is a very special woman.
Her sister, who was very the same as she is, was eaten by an ogre. He got poisoned and died!
You see what a poisonous temperament has this family, but you are angry with me...
Well, let it be so, I am staying on the throne, give me my crown.
Forget it, Forester and come to my ball with your daughter.
Cinderella? Sire, but she’s such a little child!
Do as you please, but bear in mind that I will have such a fest, that will make you forget all of your hardships and sorrows.
Farewell!
Everything is familiar here... the clock... the broom... frying pans... fire iron... fire... fireplace...
Let’s have a heart-to-heart talk.
Do you know what am I thinking of?
I think about the following:
My mother and my sisters were invited to the ball.
But I wasn't...
It isn't fair.
Is it?
They will dance with the Prince.
But he has never heard about me.
They will eat ice-cream ...
But I won't.
Though no one in the world likes ice-cream as I do.
While polishing the floor, I learned to dance.
While suffering insults in vain, I learned to think.
Listening to the cat’s purring
I learned to sing. And no one knows about that...
It hurts, doesn’t it?
I want it so much that people notice what kind of person I am.
But I want people to notice it themselves.
With no please and bother from my side.
Because I am very proud.
Can it be true that it will never happen?
Can it be true that I will never have joy and happiness?
Indeed, it is very bad when the one who deserves to go to the ball never does.
One can fall ill because of that!
I want happiness to come to me.
It is so boring to receive presents only from myself. on my birthday or on holidays.
Good people, where are you?
Good people, hey, good people?
Well then...
I will comfort myself: when everyone's gone, I will run to the Court park,
I will stand beneath the windows and feast my eyes at celebration at least from afar.
So you are dancing...
I am rushed off my feet from weariness preparing for the King's ball, but you are just dancing.
I care about you much more than about my own daughters.
I haven’t given a single notice to them for months.
While I foster you all day long.
Where’s the gratitude?
Where’s the gratitude?
I know you wanted to run away to the ball today.
Only when everyone’s gone, mother, for no one will need me then.
Follow me, Cinderella.
Do you know, my little girls, what was this good-for-nothing doing?
She was dancing!
Dancing, before you have sewn down  my ruffles?
I sewed them down a while ago, sister Anna.
Dancing, before you ironed my collar?
I ironed it a while ago, sister Marianna
She was dancing!
Thoughtless about how tired I am preparing for the royal ball!
I made some coffee to refresh you, I’ll bring it right away.
Keep where you are, you impudent one!
She knows all the answers!
She does everything to drive us crazy!
She likes nothing better than arguing!
Where’s your father, you ungrateful?
Where’s this monster?
I saw him in the forest nearby.
What was he doing there?
- He was speaking to the King.
To the king?
To the king! To the king!
He was speaking ...
To the king? Why didn’t you report that to me?
Where are you, poisonous snake?
Hellhound!
Hey, hellhound!
I’m here, my darling.
Where were you?
- In the forest.
What were you doing there?
I wanted to fight the Mad Bear.
What for?
- To rest from domestic cares, my darling.
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes!
Is it truth that you have spoken to the King?
- The very truth, my dear wife.
Have you begged the King to raise your wages?
Somehow it hasn’t come to my mind.
Well, have you begged the King to register me and my little girls in the Book of the reigning beauties of the Kingdom?
What are you talking about, darling, is it possible...
So, you have spoken to the King and wheedled nothing out of him?
Of course, but we’ve been chatting just like friends.
Poisonous snake!
They have upset me before the ball.
Why do I have to do everything?
I work like a beaver!
I run and I bustle, I beg and I quiz, I beseech enchant..
I get and I gain.
I’ve got such connections that the King himself could envy me.
But that monster...
No!
That is settled then, I will drive you out of your own house.
And you will die in the forest, and your Mad Bear will eat you!
No, dear mother, don’t! Look what I’ve made.
I made this rose from satin shreds.
It looks just like real one!
A disgusting flower.
What for an ugliness!
What a bad taste!
You could pin it to your ball dress, it would be so beatiful.
But if you don’t like it I will throw it away.
Give it to me! Give it to me!
You've said it was tasteless!
But you've shrieked it was ugly!
My dear little girls!
Don’t be angry, don’t quarrel!
To cease the quarrelling I will take the flower myself.
Are the ball dresses, which I told you to sew down during one night, ready?
Yes, mother.
Show them!
What a bad taste!
What for ugliness!
Cinderella, you wanted to run to the park and stand beheath the king’s windows.
You may do so, my dear.
- Thank you!
Just put the rooms in order, before you go.
Wash the windows, wax the floors, white the kitchen, weed out the garden, plant 7 rosebushes under the windows, sort 7 bags of beans: separate white and brown beans.
Get to know thyself, and grind coffee beans for 7 weeks.
But I will not finish even in a month.
Hurry up, my dear, hurry up.
They tease me calling me Cinderella because I work at fireside not sparing myself
I go round and round the kitchen
I am busy with oven all the time
I am always in cinders
Because of my kindness
I slave away from morning deep into the night.
Anyone can command me but no one wants to thank me.
I hide my sorrow
I sing instead of weeping
I even smile
Will I ever leave this place with its cinder and soot
Hello, goddaughter!
Godmother!
Dear godmother, you always appear all of a sudden!
Yes, I like to do so.
But last time you appeared out of the dark corner behind the fireplace.
Today you come over the air!
Yes, I am such an inventor.
You still can’t get used to the way I change!
I am delighted with that, I love miracles so much.
There wasn’t any miracle so far.
We, the true fairies, are so emotional that we can grow old or young as easily as you, humans, turn pale or red.
We grow old for sorrow and grow young for joy.
You see, how glad I am to meet you.
Today you were offended
24 times.
Of which for nothing...
- 24 times.
Today you deserved praise...
333 times.
- But they...
Did not praise you even once.
I hate those who want to do nothing and adore those who work hard.
I adore you and hate your evil step-mother.
I would turn her into a frog a long time ago, but old woman has too many connections.
Let’s talk about you. Do you want to go to the ball?
Yes, godmother, I want it very much, but I can’t.
Don’t argue, you’ll go there.
It is very bad when the one who deserves to go to the ball never goes there.
But I have so many things to do, godmother!
Today the friends will work instead of you
Boy!
Hares will weed out the garden, mice will sort the beans, cats will grind the coffee beans.
What about the roses?
Roses? Roses will grow on their own.
In a moment I am starting to work miracles.
I adore this job. Boy, give me the magic stick!
First of all, let’s roll a pumpkin here.
Thank you, dear godmother.
Wait, silly girl, how can you coach without horses.
Thank you, dear godmother.
Wait, silly girl, how can you coach without a coachman.
Miracles are not over.
Coachman!
Coachman!
Bring the coach to the doorsteps after 5 minutes.
May I go now?
O, dear, in fact, you are still such a little girl.
How can you go to the ball in such dress!
Is it me?
- Yes, it's you.
You can trust me, I can see through the people.
Even through those, whom I love very much.
I can see clear that even in splendid ball dress you stayed the same nice, industrious, kind-hearted girl.
Stay like this. This will bring you luck.
Let us go now, I will hand you into the coach.
Excuse me.
I am not a wizard, I am just a apprentice.
But let me make a few remarks, listen to me.
Let’s listen to him, he’s a good boy; an excellent pupil, he reads a lot, even makes verses.
Speak, boy, we are listening to you.
Dear Cinderella, I watch you working all day long.
You have magical hands, amazing patience and you are very kind.
You don’t know that, but I’ve become your true friend.
Though I am not a wizard, but merely a apprentice. let me tell you that friendship can work real wonders.
These glass slippers will bring you luck!
Take them.
Thank you, dear boy, I will never forgive your kindness.
And now, my dear, remember the most important thing.
You must return on the stroke of 12.
At midnight your new dress will turn into old and poor one.
The horses will turn into mice, coachman into rat and coach into pumpkin.
Remember that.
Well, I will remember that.
Boy!
Thank you, dear godmother.
Good evening.
Finally. I’m very glad.
May I present myself? King!
Don’t curtsey on stairs, it is very dangerous.
Good evening, don’t take your glove off,
I am so happy that you have come.
Good evening.
O, Your Majesty, it’s such a annoyance!
Your beautiful bertha torn and everyone can see that.
Where?
- Look!
What a horrible thing!
What an outrage, why haven’t my courtiers reported that?
Cowards, liars, flatterers!
I am resigning; I am shutting up in cloister immediately!
Since my courtiers behave so badly, farewell, my good lady.
How can you get upset because of such a trifle?
Oh, oh, oh! Don’t worry.
I will mend it so no one can see it.
Do you have a needle and cotton?
- Sure.
I am careful.
In this case, let it be so, I am staying on the throne.
Sit down, Your Majesty.
Like this, to make it handier, just sit calm and don’t move or I can jab you.
You can’t imagine how glad I am!
I adore new mysterious guests.
Certainly, the old friends are good. but I know everything about them.
For instance, Puss in Boots; he is a regular fellow, clever cookie, but when he comes he takes his boots off and sleeps at fireside.
He never plays or runs with me.
Or Tom Thumb, he always plays for money.
Hide-and-seek. Try to find him!  That's too bad!
The most important thing is that their time has passed, their fairy tales are played...
While you are...
I, the fairytale king, tell you that you are on the verge of an amazing event!
Is that so?
Upon the word of King’s honour!
It is as simple as that! It wasn’t worthy to be noisy and capricious, was it?
Wonderwork, nothing can be seen!
You’ve got magic hands!
And you speak so simply, so frankly.
I’m so happy to see you! Let’s go.
Prince looked at me 3 times, he smiled once...
- 3 times.
He draw a sigh once.
Once. 5 altogether.
The King said to me: “I am glad to see you” once,
Once.
Ho! Ho! Ho! - once.
Move along, there is a draught here – once.
Once.
3 altogether.
What do you need these notes for?
Don’t to be an intruder on our joys, monster!
He always grumbles. Such a ball...
5+3=9. Total:
9 expressions of high regard from persons of the highest rank.
Now, my dear, I will gain my object to enlist you in the Kingdom’s Book of the reigning beauties
10 expressions of high regard!
Prince, sonny!
Look, who’s come to visit us!
Do you recognise her?
Who is she? So?
Mysterious and beautiful stranger.
What a smart boy! True enough!
Why are you so pale?
Why are you silent?
Sire, I am silent because I can't talk.
Don’t believe him, he can.
Verses, speeches and compliments.
Let’s go!
I am going to introduce my court to you!
Haven't you get tired on the way?
No, I haven't, I took a rest on the way.
Let me introduce to you a girl, who has never been here before.
Supernaturally sincere and fabulously sweet.
Let me introduce my ministers to you:
The minister of ball-room dancing.
Sir marquis de Pas de trois
Your Majesty, I know this girl!
This girl is a beautiful flower.
A very striking compliment.
Don’t you recognise me?
I don’t dare to.
Now we are going to play the Royal forfeits.
No one deposits any forfeits and no one redeems any forfeits,
Everyone will do what the King wants them to.
The first forfeit is yours.
How do you find it here, my lady?
- I like it here very much.
Then, could you sing something and dance for us?
All right.
She doesn’t make difficulties! What a good girl! Sonny!
I’m going to sing you a little song.
A bit of magic.
It just makes you heart high.
It is called "Good beetle".
Kids, form yourself into a ring!
Once there lived a good beetle, an old mutual friend
He never muttered or shouted, just buzzed with his wings and strictly forbade to quarrel.
Kids, form yourself into a ring!
I'm your friend and you're my friend, an old devoted friend!
We got to love our old good beetle for his kind soul, what a merry fellow!
Kids, form yourself into a ring!
I'm your friend and you're my friend, an old devoted friend!
Who is that nice old man, who is dancing without music?
He is the kindest wizard in the world.
He can refuse no request.
Evil people often took advantage of his kindness, so he stopped his ears with wax.
Now he can hear neither requests nor music.
Arrange it that my daughters were enlisted in the Kingdom’s Book of the reigning beauties.
Listen!
The first.
Beauties.
Excuse me, madam, The next forfeit is yours.
Make something good, magical, miraculous and pleasant for all, who are present.
It's as simple as anything, Your Majesty!
- Wonderful!
Don’t be afraid!
I’m not afraid in the least bit.
I expected the wonders from this night.
Here they are!
Yet, where are we?
We were carried to Wonderland.
Where are the others?
Everyone is in the place he feels pleasant.
Wonderland is vast.
But we won’t stay here long.
One can be here just 9 minutes 10 seconds and not a moment longer.
It hurts, doesn’t it?
Do you feel sad?
I don't know...
May I ask you a question?
You are welcome.
A friend of mine ...
He’s a prince, too, he’s quite brave and decisive, too, and he met a girl at the ball, too.
He liked the girl so much that he was wholly at a loss.
What would you advise him?
May it be that the prince just seemed to like the girl?
No, he knows for sure that nothing of the kind ever happened to him and will never happen again.
You are like a dream or a vision
What if I scare you away with my clumsy touch?
What if fall into forgetful sleep for a moment and wake up in despair?
What if fall into forgetful sleep for a moment and wake up in despair?
Dear, kind, mysterious guest.
Dear, kind, mysterious guest.
Your time is up, your time is up, end your conversation.
End your conversation...
Are we still in Wonderland?
I don’t know.
I think we are.
What do you think?
- So do I.
May I have the next dance with you, o charming young lady?
I beg your pardon, marquis, but our guest has been already invited by me!
You know, Prince, there have been some days when I got so tired that I was dreaming about sleeping even when I was asleep.
But today I'm so happy; I am dancing and I want to dance more and more.
Wonderland! What a success I had there!
What a hairdressing saloon is there!
What a perfume is there!
Thank you!
The wine we drank from a magic glass in the magic tavern was fabulously excellent!
Try to guess what am I thinking of?
You think it would be lovely to have some ice-cream.
I am ashamed to confess, you are right.
Finally, I am happy!
An hour, a full hour and 15 minutes.
One hour!
Dear Cinderella!
I have a very sad news.
Sad?
- Don’t get upset!
The King ordered to set back the clock one hour.
He wanted guests to dance longer.
That is, I have nearly no time left?
Nearly.
I'm begging you, don’t get upset!
I am not a wizard; I am merely a apprentice, but I think everything can still come to a happy end!
The best ice-cream in the world, I've selected it personally!
What's the matter with you?
Thank you, dear prince. Thank you for everything.
Thank you for your care. Thank you for your politeness, tenderness and kindness. You are the best person I ever met.
Why are you talking to me so sadly?
Because I have to leave.
No, I can't let you go!
I thought it over, after the ice-cream I would have told you straight that I love you.
What am  I talking?
Don’t go!
Stay!
I may not!
I am not as ridiculous as it seems to you, it's just because I love you.
It’s no good to be angry with one because of that!
Forgive me!
I love you.
The boy got so active!
Dear Cinderella!
I brought this ruby glass of ice-cream to comfort you.
Do me a favour, taste it. I will return the glass to the palace.
Do you want some?
What happened? Are you sick, my boy?
I knew it!
I am absolutely healthy, Sire!
It is bad to cheat the old man!
40 serves of ice-cream!
You have overeaten! Such a shame, 40 serves; you haven't allowed yourself such a surfeit since you were 6.
Your stomach is frost-bitten!
I haven’t touched the ice-cream!
Really?
Indeed. What’s the matter with you then?
I fell in love.
Yes, I fell in love. with our kind and mysterious guest.
But she ran away so fast, that this glass slipper slipped off her foot and fell on the stairs.
You fell in love?
You fell in love?
I am resigning.
Deuce!  Hell! Why nobody reported me that he has grown up?
I’ve sung you the whole song about it!
Really?
All right then, I'll stay.
The boy fell in love.
It is such a happiness!
- It isn't happiness!
Nonsense!
- She loves me not!
Nonsense, she does, that’s why she didn’t stay for supper!
No, papa!
I feel offended!
I will find her!
Hello!
Gatekeepers of the Fairy Kingdom, can you hear me?
We are listening, Your Majesty!
Has the girl crossed the gate of the Fairy Kingdom?
Having a single slipper on?
How many slippers did she have on?
One!
Blonde or brunette?
Blonde!
How old was she?
About 16!
Pretty?
Very pretty!
Nobody crossed the gate!
Why did you questioned me so thoroughly, fools?
Out of idle curiosity!
Do not let anybody out, all right?
Lock the gate!
Soldiers, do you know what love is?
My only son and heir fell in love for real.
Do you understand the situation?
They had had an important conversation and then she ran away.
That can happen.
- Don’t interrupt me!
What can we do?
I will go with the minister round the country watching through spyglasses, but you will search the girl with the help of this glass slipper.
The girl who can fit the slipper upon her foot is the Prince’s bride.
Is it clear?
It’s clear!
Now go to my treasury; there you will be given seven-leagued boots for swiftness.
I wish the girl to be found before nightfall.
Good morning, madams!
Excuse us for our discourtesy.
It is known that it is improper to appear without the boots before the ladies’ eyes.
Begging your pardon, madams, they are seven-league boots.
I see, Corporal, why did you put them on?
To catch the prince’s bride, madam!
These boots exhaust us, they take us far beside the target.
You won’t believe it, madam, how many girls we left behind immediately after start.
And even more girls were frightened out of their wits.
Let me ask your daughters to fit the slipper.
You are welcome, which size?
I don’t know, but the girl who can fit the slipper upon her foot is the Prince’s bride.
The slipper fits upon the foot of one of my daughter, corporal, call for the King!
I'm telling you, the slipper fits upon the foot of one of my daughter!
I would be very grateful.
You know what I mean?
I will load you with money!
Thank you, but what about fitting?
Two barrels of wine!
I can’t do it without fitting, an order is an order.
Anna, Mary-Anna!
Draw your big toe in!
The heel.
Have you another size?
- Negative, madam.
What is to be done?
Cinderella!
She has magical hands, she can do everything!
Cinderella!
Cinderella, sometimes we were at quarrel with you, but you shouldn’t be angry with us because of that.
I aways meant well to you.
Repay me with good!
You can do everything, you have magical hands!
Mother!
Cinderella, put this slipper on...
- On my foot!
Anna’s foot.
If the slipper fits her foot the prince will marry her!
Mother, I can’t...
- Cinderella,
I am begging you, my dear, beloved daughter.
But I can’t!
- Cinderella, help Anna!
Help Anna!
Not at any price!
Go and say farewell to your father.
I will drive him out of his own home.
You know about my connections; he’ll lose his head, he’ll die in prison or in dungeon.
Don’t!
Hey, hubby!
- Mother!
All right!
I...
I’ll try.
Congratulations, Anna!
Your Royal Highness!
Well, now they will get it hot!
I will introduce my own rules. Don’t cry, Mary-Anna
The King is a widower, I’ll get a place for you, too.
It’s a pity the Kingdom is too small, there's little one can afford.
Well, I'll scrap with the neighbours, I’m good at it!
Soldiers, go to the palace on bare feet, follow the Royal mother-in-law!
Forward, march! Hurrah!
I scared you, my child!
Don’t be afraid, I’m not a villain or bad man.
I am just an unhappy prince.
I have been wandering in the forest from the first light.
I am out of my mind with worry!
Do you know who was singing in the forest nearby?
Have you met anybody?
Never in my life was I so unhappy.
I have to find this girl to ask her why has she offended me.
I can’t see you, but somehow it seems to me that you are a good girl.
Help me!
Wait!
Wait!
I don’t know, maybe I went mad.
Wasn’t it you who was singing here, in the forest?
The way you shake your head seems familiar to me!
And this golden hair! Show me your face!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
If an evil wizard put spell on you, I will kill him!
If you are poor and simple girl, I will be glad to hear it.
Princesses always play hard-to-get.
If you don’t love me
I will perform many feats of valour and make you to like me!
Say something!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where’s she?
Where is she, my dear daughter?
Here she is, Your Majesty, my dear son-in-law!
Nonsense!
Why nonsense? Take a look at her foot!
I don’t need to look at her foot since her face shows that it isn’t she.
But the slipper fits her foot!
It isn’t she anyway!
A King's word is a word of honour! The glass slipper fits her foot, consequently, she is the Prince's bride, that’s what you have told to the soldiers.
Is it true, soldiers?
They are silent!
No-no-no, it's a done deal, my dear son-in-law!
Damn it! What a mess, what should we do, marquis?
Of course, we should dance!
What’s the matter with you, my beauty?
You are walking lamely, my beauty!
Softy!
The slipper ran away from you, beauty!
It is impossibly small for you!
What a wizard managed to put it on your foot?
It is too small for you either, miss!
It doesn’t matter!
The unknown beauty has lost this slipper in the palace, too!
But it was a bit large for the unknown beauty.
Intriguer!
I will complain to the King!
I will complain against the King! Your Majesty!
It’s all right, madam, don’t be upset.
Maybe you have one more daughter?
She has!
Please, don’t chuckle!
Who is this girl?
My own daughter, Cinderella.
She is as kind as I am!
For father’s sake she helped Anna to put the slipper on.
But I didn't know anything!
I found her weeping bitterly in the garden.
Look what she wept at!
Another one!
It’s her!
Look at her, it’s her.
Prince, where’s the prince?
What for fabulous piggishness!
I can stay in this kingdom no longer!
You snake!
Follow me, my little girls!
Who do you think you are, you just put the crown in your head.
Where’s the prince?
His Royal Highness...
To chase away his worries, he ran away, at 11 o’clock, local time.
It’s my fault, why didn’t I tell everything to the prince?
Now everyone will be lost, the prince and I... the king and the whole kingdom!
Prince, dear prince, where are you?
He’s here!
He’s here!
Sonny!
I am not a wizard, I am just a apprentice, but friendship can work real wonders!
Good boy, I give you a distinction.
Change into other clothes, Cinderella, your wedding-day is near.
Get married, get married!
Yet Cinderella hasn’t told if she loves me.
I don’t like when people are disturbed while sorting out their relationship.
Well, my friends, we found our way to entire happiness.
Everyone is happy.
Except, old Forester’s wife, but it's her own fault.
Connections are connections, but one must have conscience, too.
One day you will be asked: what can you present?
And no connection can help to make a foot small, make a soul  great and a heart  fair.
Page-boy will find his happiness, too.
A daughter will be born to the prince, she will be the spitting image of Cinderella.
And the page-boy will fall in love in her.
And I will gladly bestow my granddaughter in marriage to him.
I adore these wonderful features of his soul: faithfulness, generosity, ability to love.
I adore these fabulous feelings, which will never come to an... end.
THE END
Put that away.  
We've gotta get Lang alive. 
Hello, Barnett? 
This is Pete at Lang's place.   
Dr. Lang just drove out with Billy Batson.  
They took the Mill Valley Road. 
Mill Valley Road? All right.
I'll head 'em off.  
Mill Valley Road.   
Can't you go any faster?
I'll run him off the road.   
Billy! Billy!   
[ Coughs ]  
There's-- There's been an accident.
So I see.   
Are you hurt?   
No, but my companion, he's unconscious.   
We'll be glad to take him along too.  
Our orders were to get Lang, but the Scorpion will be glad to get Batson too. 
Now if you'll-- if you'll take me to--  
We know where to take you.  
Get in. 
Wh-What do you mean?
I said get in!  
The Scorpion!   
Yes, Dr. Lang, the Scorpion.   
It's a pleasure to see you here.
Please, be seated.  
Billy Batson was with him, so I brought him along. 
Splendid.   
Where's Batson? 
Downstairs under guard. 
He's unconscious.   
I'll attend to him when 
I finish with Dr. Lang. 
What do you want of me? 
Your lens to help complete the golden scorpion atom smasher.   
That's something I--
I'll never give you.
I think I can change your mind.   
Barnett, prepare to loosen  
Dr. Lang's tongue.  
Are you going to talk now, Dr. Lang?  
 Yes! Yes!  
 Anything you wish! 
Release him, Barnett.   
Where's your lens?  
In my library.  
There's a painting. 
 Behind the painting,   
 there's-- there's a safe.  
Write down the combination. 
Get the lens from Lang's safe at once.   
Yes, sir.   
Wait.   
Something should be done with Batson.
Do you want me to take care of him?
No. That's a pleasure   
I'm reserving for myself.   
I'll have him brought up. 
Wha-- What are you going to do with me?
Nothing, until I know your lens is where you say it is. 
[ Footsteps Approaching ]   
He hasn't come to yet.  
Well, get some water and bring him out of it.
Shazam! 
[ Screams ] 
Captain Marvel! 
Yes. Now I'll learn who you really are. 
And that gun of yours isn't going to stop me. 
But I think it will.
Dr. Lang will die if you come one step closer.
[ Rings ]   
Mr. Malcolm's secretary speaking.   
Who? Oh, Dr. Lang.  
- Let me talk to Malcolm.   
- Mr. Malcolm's out of town.
The Scorpion's men are after my lens.  
Can I be of any assistance? 
The safe in your library?   
Yes, that's right.  
It's in the alcove behind a painting.  
The combination is R-24--   
Now, Betty, repeat that combination to me. 
And then back to R-11.  
I'll start at once. 
Now, Betty, there's something   
I must warn you about.  
There's a death trap in the--
 [ Door Opens ] 
You're the Scorpion?
Dr. Lang! Dr. Lang! 
Betty-- Save her.   
Go to my house. 
Why?
Lens in my safe.
There's a death trap.   
Save her.   
Pete, we're gonna be busy inside. Understand?
Sure.   
Lock up the gates and keep out of sight.  
This must be it.
This is it! 
Open up those panels.   
Here's the combination. 
Right, 24.  
Shazam! 
Betty! Betty!   
Fix everything just the way you found it.   
And here's the combination. 
But he talked about some danger.
A matter of life or death, he said.
I think I know what he meant.  
There was a man with a gun as you drove up.
Really? Where is he?
He's been well taken care of. 
Let's go get that lens. 
He said it was in the alcove, didn't he?  
Yes, behind the painting.   
This is it. 
Read the combination to me. 
Right, 24.  
Left, 18.   
Right, nine.
Left, 16.   
Right, seven.   
Left, 10.   
And here's the last number: right, 11.
I owe everything to George Bailey.
Help him, dear Father.
Joseph, Jesus and Mary, help my friend Mr. Bailey.
Help my son George tonight.
He never thinks about himself, God.
That's why he's in trouble.
George is a good guy.
Give him a break, God.
I love him, dear Lord.
Watch over him tonight.
Please, God.
Something's the matter with Daddy.
Please bring Daddy back.
Please bring Daddy home.
Watch over him tonight.
Please bring Daddy back.
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?
Looks like we'll have to send someone down.
A lot of people asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
George Bailey?
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night.
You're right.
We'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
That's why I came to see you, sir.
It's that clockmaker's turn again.
Oh, Clarence.
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?
We've passed him up right along.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the IQ of a rabbit.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child. Simple.
Joseph, send for Clarence.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence.
A man down on Earth needs our help.
Splendid. Is he sick?
No, worse. He's discouraged.
At exactly 10:45 p.m. Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Oh, dear, dear, his life?
Then I've only an hour to dress.
What are they wearing now?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Sir, if I should accomplish this mission,
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?
I've been waiting for over 200 years now, sir, and people are beginning to talk.
What's that book you've got there?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey and you'll get your wings.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Poor George. Sit down.
Sit down? What are we...
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Well, naturally, of course. I...
Now, keep your eyes open.
See the town?
Where? I don't see a thing.
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got your wings yet.
Now, look, I'll help you out.
Concentrate.
Begin to see something?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Oh, wonderful.
Yay! Yippee!
Okay, boys, let's go.
Hey, who's that?
That's your problem. George Bailey.
A boy?
That's him when he was 12 back in 1919.
Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Come on, Marty.
Let's go, Marty!
Attaboy, Marty.
Hee-haw!
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!
Here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother Harry Bailey.
I'm not scared.
Come on, Harry.
Let's go, Harry!
Come on, Harry!
Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!
Help, George, help!
Help!
Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming!
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!
- Help.
- Make a chain, gang.
George saved his brother's life that day, but he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear.
Cost him his hearing in that ear.
It was weeks before he was able to go back to his after-school job at old man Gower's drugstore.
Mr. Potter.
Who's that, a king?
That's Henry F. Potter, the richest and meanest man in the county.
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Go to work, slave.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Wish I had a million dollars.
Hot dog!
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.
You're late.
Yes, sir.
Hello, George.
Hello, Mary.
Hello, Violet.
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?
She was here first.
I'm still thinking.
Shoelaces?
Please, Georgie.
I like him.
You like every boy.
What's wrong with that?
Here you are.
Help me down?
Help you down?
Made up your mind yet?
I'll take chocolate.
- With coconuts?
- I don't like coconuts.
You don't like coconuts?
Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from?
Lookit here.
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands, the Coral Sea.
A new magazine. I never saw it before.
Of course you never.
Only us explorers can get it.
I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Is this the ear you can't hear on?
George Bailey,
I'll love you till the day I die.
I'm going out exploring someday.
You watch.
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems and maybe three or four wives.
Wait and see.
- George. George!
- Yes, sir?
You're not paid to be a canary.
No, sir.
Mr. Gower, do you want something?
Anything?
No.
- Anything I can do back here?
- No.
I'll get them, sir.
Quick, take those capsules over to Mrs. Blaine.
She's waiting for them.
Yes, sir.
They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Yeah.
Is it a charge, sir?
Yes, George.
Mr. Gower, I...
- Oh, get going.
- Yes, sir.
Avast there, Captain Cook.
Where you heading?
- I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
- Some other time, George.
- It's important.
- There's a squall in there.
It's shaping up into a storm.
- Uncle Billy, telephone.
- Who is it?
- Bank examiner.
- Bank examiner?
I should have called him yesterday.
Switch it inside.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Well, you're begging.
That's a whole lot worse.
All I'm asking for is 30 days more.
- Pop.
- Just a minute, Son.
Just 30 short days.
I'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.
- Shove me up, shove me up.
- Pop.
- Just a minute.
- Have you put any real pressure on these people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Times are bad, Mr. Potter.
A lot of these people are out of work.
Well, then, foreclose.
I can't do that.
These families have children.
- Pop.
- They're not my children.
But they're somebody's children,
Mr. Potter.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character?
You have no family, no children.
You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
He's not a failure!
- You can't say that about my father.
- George, George. Quiet, George.
You're not.
You're the biggest man in town...
- Run along, run along.
- ...bigger than him,
- bigger than everybody.
- Gives you an idea of the Baileys.
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.
I'll talk to you tonight.
What?
Why, that medicine should have been there an hour ago.
It will be over in five minutes,
Mrs. Blaine.
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?
I... You...
Didn't you hear what I said?
Yes, sir. I...
What kind of tricks are you playing anyway?
Why didn't you deliver them right away?
Don't you know that boy's very sick?
You're hurting my sore ear.
You lazy loafer.
Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing.
You put something wrong in those capsules.
I know you're unhappy.
You got the telegram, and you're upset.
You put something bad in those capsules.
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.
Just look and see what you did.
The bottle you took the powder from, it's poison.
I tell you, it's poison.
I know you feel bad.
- Oh!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.
I know how you're feeling.
I won't ever tell a soul.
Hope to die, I won't.
Oh, George. George.
An overnight bag.
Genuine English cowhide.
Combination lock.
- Fitted up with brushes, combs...
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.
I want a big one.
What did you stop it for?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Who is it?
George Bailey.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist?
That's the kid.
It's a good face. I like it.
I like George Bailey.
Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Not a soul.
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?
Well, wait and see.
Big, see? I don't want one for one night.
I want something for 1,001 nights with plenty of room here for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand.
Great big thing, about...
- I see. A flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.
I don't suppose you'd like this old secondhand job, would you?
Now you're talking.
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft in case the boat sunk.
- How much this cost?
- No charge.
That's my trick ear, Joe.
It sounded like you said "no charge."
That's right.
Well, what's my name doing on it?
A little present from old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.
He did? What do you know about that?
My old boss. Isn't that nice?
What boat are you sailing on?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.
It's just exactly what I wanted.
Forget it.
- It's wonderful of you to think of me.
- Hope you enjoy it.
I wish I had a million dollars.
Hot dog!
Avast there, Captain Cook!
- You got your sea legs yet?
- Parlez-vous fran莽ais, mister?
Hey, send us some of those picture postcards, will you, George?
Hey, George, don't take any plug nickels.
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.
Hey, Ernie!
- Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert.
- Hiya, George.
- George.
- Hey, I'm a rich tourist today.
How about driving me home in style?
- Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in.
- Yes, sir.
And for the carriage trade,
I put on my hat.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hello, Violet.
Hey, you look good.
That's some dress you got on there.
This old thing?
Why, I only wear it when I don't care how I look.
- How would you like to take...
- Yes.
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.
No, thanks.
I think I'll go home and see what the wife's doing.
Family man.
George, Harry, you're shaking the house down.
Stop it.
Let them alone.
I wish I was up there with them.
But Harry will tear his dinner suit.
George!
That's why all children should be girls.
Well, if they were all girls there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.
George, Harry, come down to dinner this minute.
Everything's getting cold, and you know how long we've been waiting for you.
- Okay, Ma.
- Okay, Ma.
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!
- We got a present for you, Pop.
- There you are.
Oh, you two idiots.
George, sit down and have dinner.
- Fine.
- I've eaten.
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing for your graduating party? Look at you!
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Annie, my sweet, have you got those pies?
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom!
Annie, I'm in love with you.
There's a moon out tonight.
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal in the old Bailey boarding house.
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.
Pop, can I have the car? I gotta take over a lot of plates and things.
What plates?
Mom, I'm chairman of the Eats Committee.
We only need a couple of dozen.
Oh, no, you don't, Harry.
Now, not my best Haviland, no.
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.
What's the matter? You look tired.
I had another tussle with Potter today.
I thought when we put him on the board of directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
What's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
He's a sick man, frustrated, sick in his mind.
Sick in his soul, if he has one.
He hates everybody that has anything that he can't have.
He hates us mostly, I guess.
Gangway. Gangway.
- So long, Pop.
- So long.
- You got a match?
- Very funny, very funny.
Put those things in the car, and I'll get your tie and studs ready for you. Now, hurry up.
- Okay, Mom.
- Now, don't drop one of those.
You coming later, George?
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Couldn't want a better death.
Lots of pretty girls, and we're gonna use that new floor tonight, too.
- I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, Son.
Oh, Pop, just a little?
No, Son. Not one drop.
Boys and girls and music.
Why do they need gin?
Did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Pretty much.
You know, George, I wish we could send Harry to college with you.
Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
We have that all figured out.
You see, Harry will take my job at the Building and Loan, work there for four years, then he'll go.
Pretty young for that job.
Well, no younger than I was.
Well, you were born older, George.
How's that?
I said you were born older.
I suppose you've decided what you want to do when you get out of college.
Well, you know what I've always talked about, build things, design new buildings, plan modern cities.
All that stuff I've been talking about.
Still after that first million before you're 30?
I'll settle for half that in cash.
Of course, it's just a hope.
But you wouldn't consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you?
Well, I... I...
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?
Then you'd be more comfortable, and you could hear everything that's going on.
I would if I thought
I'd hear anything worth listening to.
You would, eh?
I know it's soon to talk about it.
No, now, Pop, I couldn't.
I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that, but I...
It's this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe.
I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important.
You know, George,
I feel that, in a small way, we're doing something important, satisfying a fundamental urge.
It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace.
And we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office.
I know, Pop. I know that.
I wish I felt that...
I've been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to...
Most of my friends have already finished college.
I just feel like if I didn't get away,
I'd bust.
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.
Now, you've got talent, Son. I've seen it.
You get yourself an education and get out of here.
Pop, you want a shock?
I think you're a great guy.
- Why, did you hear that, Annie?
- I heard it.
It's about time one of you lunkheads said it.
I'm gonna miss old Annie.
Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Have a good time, Son.
Excuse me.
There you are.
George, hello.
You know my kid brother George.
- I'm gonna put him through college.
- Hello, George.
Hee-haw!
Sam Wainwright.
How are you? When did you get here?
This afternoon.
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Old college graduate now.
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright they call me.
Well, freshman, looks like you're gonna make it after all, huh?
- Harry, you're the guy I want to see.
- Hello, Sam.
- Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?
Yeah, he's followed every game, and his mouth's watering.
He wants me to find out if you're gonna come along with us.
Well, I got to make some dough first.
Well, you better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.
Not broken down old guys like this one.
Hee-haw!
George, welcome back.
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?
Putting a pool under this floor was a great idea.
Saved us another building.
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.
There's lots of stuff here to eat and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.
A third dance... A third...
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello. What am I bid?
George.
Marty! Well, it's old home week.
- Marty!
- Sam, Harry, how are you?
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?
- You remember my kid sister Mary.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
"Mama wants you, Marty.
Mama wants you." Remember?
Dance with her, will you?
Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough already with all these kids.
Come on, be a sport.
Just dance with her one time, and you'll give her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!
Don't be long, Marty.
I'm not being a wet nurse to a...
The next thing I knew, some guy came up and tripped me.
That's the reason why I came in fourth.
If it hadn't been for that, that race'd have been a cinch.
I tried to find out who it was later, but I couldn't find out.
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was, because they'd be scared.
'Cause they know what kind of a guy I am.
You remember George. This is Mary.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
Well, well, well.
Now to get back to my story, see?
Hey, this is my dance.
Why don't you stop annoying people?
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!
- Well, hello.
- Hello.
You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Well, I don't.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Me?
No. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
The big Charleston contest!
The prize, a genuine loving cup.
Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor.
Let's go!
I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
Okay. What can we lose?
Hey, you're wonderful.
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?
Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor?
And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up?
And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack?
And I've got the key.
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!
They're cheering us. We must be good.
Get out of there!
What... Oh, well.
~ Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight? ~
~ Can't you come out tonight? ~
~ Can't you come out tonight? ~
~ Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight ~
~ And dance ~
~ By the light ~
~ Of the moon ~
- Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.
You should have seen the commotion in that locker room.
I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here.
Let me hold that old wet dress of yours.
Do I look as funny as you do?
I guess I'm not quite the football type.
You look wonderful!
You know, if it wasn't me talking,
I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, why don't you say it?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
How old are you anyway?
Eighteen.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Too young or too old?
Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you.
Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
I mean, without a dress you look older.
I mean younger. You look... You just...
I'm on the thing here.
Sir, my train, please.
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.
Your caboose, milady.
You may kiss my hand.
Hey.
Hey, Mary.
As I was lumberin' down the street
Down the street, down the street
Okay, then. I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
No, you see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass.
And you got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too.
Oh, no, George, don't.
It's full of romance, that old place.
I'd like to live in it.
In that place?
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.
Now, watch.
Right in the second floor, there. See?
What did you wish, George?
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that.
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm gonna see the world!
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum.
Then I'm coming back here and go to college to see what they know.
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build airfields.
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.
What, are you gonna throw a rock?
Hey, that's pretty good.
What did you wish, Mary?
Buffalo gals can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight
And
Dance by the light of the moon?
What did you wish when you threw that rock?
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.
If I told you, it might not come true.
What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want? You want the moon?
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.
I'll take it.
Then what?
Well, then you could swallow it, and it would all dissolve, see?
And the moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and your toes and the ends of your hair.
- Am I talking too much?
- Yes!
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
How's that?
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
You want me to kiss her, huh?
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister.
Come on back out here!
I'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. What are you...
Mary?
Okay, I give up. Where are you?
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.
Here you are. Catch.
Wait a minute. What am I doing?
This is a very interesting situation.
Please give me my robe.
A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day.
I'd like to have my robe.
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.
- Ouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.
Give me my robe.
I've read about things like this, but I've never...
Shame on you!
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.
My mother's way up on the corner there.
I'll call the police.
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.
Then I'm going to scream!
Maybe I could sell tickets.
Let's see. No, the point is in order to get this robe... I've got it.
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.
George! George!
George, come on home! Quick!
- Your father's had a stroke.
- What?
- Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
- Come on, George, let's hurry.
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes.
Campbell's there now.
I think that's all we'll need you for, George.
- I know you're anxious to make a train.
- I have a taxi waiting downstairs.
I want the board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months.
Good luck to you at school, George.
- Good luck, George.
- Goodbye, George.
And now we come to the real purpose of this meeting, to appoint a successor to our dear friend Peter Bailey.
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to get to my real purpose.
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?
I claim this institution is not necessary to this town.
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver.
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...
I'll wring his neck.
George, did you hear what that buzzard...
Mr. Chairman.
It's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to talk about chloroforming the Building and Loan.
Peter Bailey died three months ago.
I second Mr. Potter's motion.
Very well. In that case,
I'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw. But before you go,
I'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
I'll go further than that.
I'll say that to the public
Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.
That's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave.
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.
That's what killed him.
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him.
God rest his soul.
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.
But ideals without common sense can ruin this town.
Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop, you know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know.
I happen to know the bank turned down this loan.
But he comes here, and we're building him a house worth $5,000.
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.
You have all the papers there.
His salary, insurance.
I can personally vouch for his character.
- A friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money.
What does that get us?
A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class.
And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas.
Now, I say...
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.
You're right when you say my father was no businessman. I know that.
Why he ever started this cheap penny-ante Building and Loan
I'll never know.
But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was...
Why, in the 25 years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?
He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me.
But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.
And what's wrong with that?
Why, here, you're all businessmen here.
Don't it make them better citizens, and doesn't it make them better customers?
You said that they...
What'd you say just a minute ago?
They had to wait and save their money before they even thought of a decent home.
Wait? Wait for what?
Until their children grow up and leave them?
Until they're so old and broken-down that they...
Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000?
Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about, they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.
Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?
Anyway, my father didn't think so.
People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.
Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.
I'm not interested in your book.
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
I know very well what you're talking about.
You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you.
That's what you're talking about, I know.
Well, I've said too much. I...
You're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.
There's just one thing more, though.
This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to Potter.
Come on, Uncle Billy.
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him,
George, old boy.
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.
What happened?
We heard a lot of yelling.
Well, we're being voted out of business after 25 years.
- Easy come, easy go.
- Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."
You still want me to hang around, George?
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
- Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.
You're a week late for school already.
Go on.
- What's going on in there?
- Never mind. Don't worry about that.
They're putting us out of business.
So what? I can get another job.
- I'm only 55.
Go on, go on.
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now you don't want to miss college, too, do you?
George! George!
They voted Potter down.
They want to keep it going.
You did it, George. You did it.
They got one condition, only one condition.
- What's that?
- And that's the best part of it.
They've appointed George here as Executive Secretary to take his father's place.
- Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
- You can keep him on. That's all right.
As Secretary, you can hire anyone you like.
Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.
This is my last chance.
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.
But, George, they'll vote with Potter otherwise.
- I know, I know, he didn't go.
- That's right.
Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother, Harry, and sent him to college.
Harry became a football star.
Made second team all-American.
Yeah, but what happened to George?
George got four years older, waiting for Harry to come back and take over the Building and Loans.
There are plenty of jobs around for somebody that likes to travel.
Look at this. Here.
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted, man with construction experience."
Here's the Yukon, right here.
"Wanted, man with engineering experience."
There she blows.
You know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are?
Breakfast is served.
Lunch is served. Dinner...
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles.
- Peanut?
- There's the professor now.
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa all-American Bailey.
Why, old George
"Geographic Explorer" Bailey.
What? No husky dogs? No sled?
Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.
Nobody ever changes here, you know that.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
- Say, where's Mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.
George, Uncle Billy,
I want you to meet Ruth.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.
- Huh?
- Well, I wired you I had a surprise.
Here she is. Meet the wife.
Well, what do you know? A wife.
- Well, how do you do? Congratulations.
- How do you do?
What am I doing? Congratulations!
- Doggone it, Harry, you...
- They're married!
Why don't you tell somebody?
Come on, Mrs. Bailey,
I can't wait to see everybody's reaction.
- You're really married?
- Why, yes.
What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine?
Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary.
My father offered him a job.
Oh, he got you and the job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.
George, about that job. Ruth spoke out of turn. I never said I'd take it.
You've been holding the bag here for four years, and, well, I won't let you down, George.
I would like to...
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags.
I'll be right back.
It was a surprise to me.
This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife.
- How are you?
- Old, old friend of the Baileys.
Oh, really? What are their names?
Let's see...
Oh, of course,
I've heard him speak of you.
And I want to tell you, we're gonna give the biggest party this town ever saw.
Here, have some popcorn.
George, George, George.
That's all Harry ever talks about.
Ruth, this...
What about this job?
Well, my father owns a glass factory in Buffalo.
He wants to get Harry started in the research business.
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.
Not much money, but good future, you know.
- Yeah.
- Harry's a genius at research.
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.
Hey, Joe.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I feel so good.
I could spit in Potter's eye.
I think I will. I think I will.
What did you say? Huh?
Maybe I'd better go home.
Where's my hat? Where's my...
- Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine?
- The middle one.
Oh, thank you, George.
Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look, if you'll point me in the right direction...
Would you do that, George?
Right down here.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?
Now you just turn this way and then right straight down there.
Oh, that way, huh?
~ My wild Irish rose ~
I'm all right. I'm all right.
~ The sweetest flower I know ~
Hello, Ma.
That's for nothing.
- How do you like her?
- She's swell, isn't she?
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Came back three days ago.
Nice girl, Mary.
Kind that'll help you find the answers, George.
Stop that grunting.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Sure. Sam Wainwright.
- Hee-haw?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
- Well, how do you know?
- What, did she discuss it with you?
- No.
- Well, then how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?
Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Besides,
Sam Wainwright's away in New York,
- and you're here in Bedford Falls.
- And all's fair in love and war.
I don't know about war.
Mother of mine, I can see right through you right to your back-collar button.
Trying to get rid of me, huh?
Well, here's your hat.
What's your hurry?
All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal,
I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
Oh, George.
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction...
This direction.
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
- Excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.
I think I got a date.
But stick around, fellows, just in case, huh?
We'll wait for you, baby.
- Hello, Georgie Porgie!
- Hello Vi.
- What gives?
- Nothing.
Where are you going?
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Georgie, don't you ever get tired of just reading about things?
Yes.
- What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.
Are you game, Vi?
Let's make a night of it.
I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes
- and walk through the grass.
- Huh?
Then we can go up to the falls.
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it.
Then we can climb Mount Bedford and smell the pines and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking.
There'll be a terrific scandal.
Georgie, have you gone crazy?
Why, walk in the grass in my bare feet?
Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford.
- If you think...
- Okay, just forget about the whole thing.
- What are you doing, picketing?
- Hello, Mary.
I just happened to be passing by here.
Yes, so I noticed.
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?
- Have you made up your mind?
- About what?
About coming in.
Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over
- to pay me a visit.
- My mother just called you?
Well, how did she know?
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.
I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by here.
What do you...
Went for a walk. That's all.
- I'll be downstairs, Mother.
- All right, dear.
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Well, I'll come in for a minute.
But I...
I didn't tell anybody
I was coming over here, you know.
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.
Where did you get that dress?
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.
I thought you would go back to New York, like Sam and Angie and the rest of them.
I worked there a couple of vacations, but I don't know.
I guess I was homesick.
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?
Yes, and my family and...
Everything.
Would you like to sit down?
All right, for a minute.
I still can't understand it, though.
You know, I didn't tell anybody
I was coming here.
Would you rather leave?
No. I don't want to be rude.
Well, then, sit down.
What's that?
Some joke, huh?
Well...
I see it still smells like pine needles around here.
Thank you.
And dance by the
What's the matter?
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well...
Nice about your brother Harry and Ruth, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.
Don't you like her?
Well, of course I like her.
She's a peach.
Oh, just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
No. Marriage is all right for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.
Mary! Mary!
Who's down there with you?
It's George Bailey, Mother.
George Bailey? What's he want?
I don't know.
What do you want?
Me? Not a thing.
I just came in to get warm.
He's making violent love to me, Mother.
You tell him to go right back home, and don't you leave the house, either!
Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York tonight.
What's your mother mean?
You know, I didn't come here to...
- What did you come here for, then?
- I don't know. You tell me.
You're supposed to be the one that has all the answers. You tell me.
- Why don't you go home?
- That's where I'm going.
I don't know why I came here in the first place.
- Good night.
- Good night!
Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam.
I'll get it.
Whatever were you doing that you couldn't hear?
Mary, he's waiting.
Hello?
Forgot my hat.
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?
I'm great.
Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.
Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.
There's an old friend of yours here.
George Bailey.
You mean old mossback George?
Yes, old mossback George.
Hee-haw! Put him on.
Wait just a minute. I'll call him. George!
He doesn't want to speak to George, you idiot.
He does so. He asked for him.
George, Sam wants to speak to you.
Hi, Sam.
Well, George Baileyoffski!
Hey, a fine pal you are.
What're you trying to do, steal my girl?
What do you mean?
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.
Here... Here's Mary.
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to talk to both of you.
Tell Mary to get on the extension.
- Mother's on the extension. We...
- I am not!
We can both hear. Come here.
We're listening, Sam.
Well, look, I have a big deal coming up that's gonna make us all rich.
George, do you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you'd read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
- Chili beans.
- Shut up, will you?
You remember, out of chili...
Out of soybeans.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.
Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea, and he's gonna build a factory outside of Rochester.
How do you like that?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Well, why not?
Can you think of anything better?
Well, I don't know.
Just why not right here?
You remember that old tool and machinery works?
You tell your father he can get that for a song.
And all the labor he wants, too.
Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
That so? Well, I'll tell him.
Hey, that sounds great.
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.
Now here's the point, Mary.
Mary, you're in on this, too.
Now listen. Have you got any money?
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.
Well, now, listen.
I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, do you hear?
And, George, I may have a job for you, that is unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan.
Well, this is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor.
Oh, Mary. Mary?
I'm here.
Would you tell that guy
I'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, do you hear?
The chance of a lifetime!
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.
Now you listen to me.
I don't want any plastics, and I don't want any ground floors.
And I don't want to get married, ever, to anyone.
You understand that?
I want to do what I want to do.
And you're... And you're...
- Oh, Mary, Mary.
- George, George, George.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Mary...
Here they come! Here they come!
Goodbye, George!
Goodbye!
First Harry, now George.
Annie, we're just two old maids now.
You speak for yourself, Miss B.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Hey, look.
There's somebody driving this cab.
Bert the cop sent this over.
He said to float away to Happyland on the bubbles.
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!
By the way, where are you two going on this here now honeymoon?
Where are we going? Look at this.
There's the kitty, Ernie.
Here, come on, count it, Mary.
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna shoot the works.
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.
The highest hotels, the oldest champagne, the richest caviar, the hottest music and the prettiest wife.
That does it! Then what?
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?
That does it, come here. Come here.
Don't look now, but there's something funny going on over there at the bank, George.
I've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of being a run.
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in the bank, you better hurry.
George, let's not stop. Let's go!
Just a minute, dear.
- Please, let's not stop, George.
- I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?
Charlie? What's the matter here, can't you get in?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
George.
Come on in, everybody.
That's right. Just come on in.
Look out, you.
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?
There are a lot of seats over there.
Just make yourselves at home.
George, can I see you a minute?
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.
This is a pickle, George.
This is a pickle.
All right, now, what happened?
How did it start?
How does a thing like this ever start?
- All I know is the bank called our loan.
- When?
About an hour ago.
I handed over all our cash.
- All of it?
- Every cent of it,
- and still it was less than we owe them.
- Holy mackerel!
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors.
I... I...
The whole town's gone crazy.
Yeah, hello?
George, it's Potter.
Hello?
George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors.
Is that true?
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.
George, are you all right?
Do you need any police?
Police? What for?
Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know.
George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis.
I've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs.
They'll close up for a week and then reopen.
He just took over the bank.
I may lose a fortune, but I'm willing to guarantee your people, too.
Just tell them to bring their shares over here, and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.
You never miss a trick, do you, Potter?
Well, you're gonna miss this one.
If you close your doors before 6:00 p.m., you will never reopen.
George, was it a nice wedding?
Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Yeah.
You can take this one off now.
Now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appeared.
I have some news for you, folks.
I was just talking to old man Potter, and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank.
The bank's gonna reopen next week.
But, George, I got my money here.
Did he guarantee this place?
Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.
We don't need Potter over here.
Then, I'll take mine now.
No, but you're...
You're thinking of this place all wrong, as if I had the money back in a safe.
The money's not here.
Well, your money's in Joe's house.
That's right next to yours.
And in the Kennedy house and Mrs. Macklin's house and 100 others.
Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're gonna pay it back to you as best they can.
Now, what are you gonna do, foreclose on them?
I got $242 in here, and $242 isn't going to break anybody.
Okay, Tom. All right.
Here you are. You sign this.
You'll get your money in 60 days.
Sixty days?
Now, that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares.
- Tom! Tom, did you get your money?
- No.
Well, I did.
Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents on the dollar for every share you've got.
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!
Well, what do you say?
Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement.
Now, give us 60 days on this.
- Okay, Randall.
- Are you going to go to Potter's?
Better to get half than nothing.
Tom! Tom!
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.
Now, listen. Now, listen to me.
I beg of you not to do this thing.
If Potter gets a hold of this Building and Loan, there'll never be another decent house built in this town.
He's already got charge of the bank.
He's got the bus line.
He got the department stores.
And now he's after us. Why?
Well, it's very simple.
Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why.
And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides.
Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, didn't you?
Well, have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack?
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last year when things weren't going so well and you couldn't make your payments.
Well, you didn't lose your house, did you?
You think Potter would've let you keep it?
Can't you understand what's happening here?
Don't you see what's happening?
Potter isn't selling.
Potter's buying, and why?
Because we're panicky and he's not.
That's why.
He's picking up some bargain.
Now we can get through this thing all right.
We've got to stick together, though.
We've got to have faith in each other.
But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and I need money.
How am going to live until the bank opens?
- I got doctor bills to pay.
- I need cash.
I can't feed my kids on faith.
How much do you need?
Hey! I got $2,000.
Here's $2,000.
This'll tide us over till the bank reopens.
- All right, Tom, how much do you need?
Tom, just enough to tide you over until the bank reopens.
I'll take $242.
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.
Your account's still here. That's a loan.
- Okay. All right, Ed?
- I got $300 here, George.
Now, Ed, what'll it take till the bank opens? What do you need?
Well, I suppose $20.
$20. Now you're talking.
Thanks, Ed. That's fine.
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson, how much do you want?
But it's your own money, George.
Never mind about that.
How much do you want?
- I can get along with $20, all right.
- $20, fine.
- And I'll sign the paper.
- You don't have to sign anything.
I know you. You pay it when you can.
That's okay.
- All right, Mrs. Davis?
- Could I have $17.50?
Bless your heart. Of course you can have it. You got 50 cents?
- Seven...
- We're gonna make it, George.
...five, four, three, two, one, bingo!
We made it! Close the door, Eustace!
We made it.
Look, look, we're still in business.
We've still got 2 bucks left.
Look, let's have some of that.
Let's celebrate!
Get some glasses, Tilly.
- Well, a couple of financial wizards.
- Call us Rockefellers.
Get a tray for these two great big important simoleons here.
We'll save them for seed. A toast.
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar and to Papa Dollar, and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business, you better have a family real quick.
- I wish they were rabbits.
- I wish they were, too.
Okay, let's put them in the safe and see what happens.
Close the door.
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.
Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married.
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...
Look, I got a train to catch.
Well, the train's gone.
I wonder if Ernie's still here with his taxicab.
George, there's a call for you.
Look, will you get my wife on the phone?
She's probably over at her mother's.
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.
I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife.
Here, I'll take it in here.
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry.
Huh? Come home? What home?
320 Sycamore? Well, what...
Whose home is that?
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
How would you like to get a ticket next week?
You got any romance in you?
- Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it.
- Liver pills.
Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon?
What we want is romantic places, beautiful places, places George wants to go.
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.
Come on, we got to get this up.
He's coming.
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.
What are they, ducks?
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.
Hiya... Good evening, sir.
Entree, Monsieur.
Entree.

- Rent?

Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
All in?
Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.
Good old George, he's always making a speech.
Hee-haw!
- Sam Wainwright.
- Oh, who cares.
Bread. That this house may never know hunger.
Salt. That life may always have flavor.
And wine. That joy and prosperity may reign forever.
Enter the Martini castle.
Look, Mr. Potter, it's no skin off my nose.
I'm just your little rent collector.
But you can't laugh off this Bailey Park anymore.
Look at it.
Congressman Black is here to see you, sir.
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait.
Go on.
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen houses stuck here and there.
There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies.
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.
Look at it today.
Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw,
90% owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you.
Your Potter's Field, my dear
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.
And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks.
Oh, they are, are they?
Even though they know the Baileys never made a dime out of it.
You know very well why.
The Baileys were all chumps.
Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build.
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- You are not me.
As I say, it's no skin off my nose, but one of these days this bright young man is gonna be asking
George Bailey for a job.
The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough.
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're gonna drive on down to Florida.
Why don't you have your friends join us?
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh?
Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
- Oh, now, don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.
Well, I guess we better run along.
- Awfully happy to have met you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you, too.
- Goodbye. Glad to see you.
- Goodbye, George.
So long, George.
See you in the funny papers.
- So long, Mary.
- Bye, Sam. Have fun.
- Thanks for dropping around.
- Florida!
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw.
Thank you, sir.
- That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
- You like it?
I'll send you a box.
Well, I...
I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?
George, now that's just what I like so much about you.
George, I am an old man, and most people hate me.
But I don't like them, either, so that makes it all even.
You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan.
You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it.
Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it.
You have been stopping me.
In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing.
Take during the Depression, for instance.
You and I were the only ones that kept our heads.
You saved the Building and Loan.
I saved all the rest.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
The envious ones say that,
George, the suckers.
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.
Now let's look at your side.
Young man, 27-28, married, making, say, $40 a week.
Out of which, after supporting your mother and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, $10, if you skimp.
A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the $10.
Now, if this young man of 28 was a common, ordinary yokel,
I'd say he was doing fine.
But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel.
He is an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man, who hates his job, who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do.
A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born.
A young man... The smartest one of the crowd, mind you.
A young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places because he's trapped.
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away, playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters.
Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate?
- Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter?
- My point?
- My point is I want to hire you.
- Hire me?
Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties.
George, I'll start you out at $20,000 a year.
$20,000 a year?
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe.
You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Would I?
You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you?
You know, this is me.
You remember me?
- George Bailey.
- George Bailey.
Yeah, George Bailey, whose ship has just come in.
Provided he has enough brains to climb aboard.
Holy mackerel.
Well, how about the Building and Loan?
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success?
I'm offering you a three-years contract at $20,000 a year, starting today.
Is it a deal, or isn't it?
Well, Mr. Potter, I...
I know I ought to jump at the chance but I... I just...
I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me 24 hours to think it over?
Sure, sure, sure.
You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
I'd like to do that.
Yeah. In the meantime,
I'll draw up the papers.
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?
Okay, Mr. Potter.
No. No. No, no, now wait a minute, here.
I don't need 24 hours.
I don't have to talk to anybody.
I know right now, and the answer is no.
No, doggone it!
You sit around here, and you spin your little webs, and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money.
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.
In the whole vast configuration of things,
I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider.
You...
And that goes for you, too!
And it goes for you, too!
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year, maybe Europe once in a while.
I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that.
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm gonna see the world.
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build air fields.
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.
I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long.
What is it you want, Mary?
What, you want the moon?
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it and pull her down for you.
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight
And
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
To keep from being an old maid.
You could have married Sam Wainwright and anybody else in town.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town.
I want my baby to look like you.
You didn't even have a honeymoon.
I promised you...
- Your what?
- My baby.
Your... Your...
Mary, you on the nest?
- George Bailey lassoes stork.
- Lassoes a stork!
You mean you...
What is it, a boy or a girl?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
- No!
- Mary had her baby, a boy.
Then she had another one, a girl.
Day after day she worked away, remaking the old Granville house into a home.
Night after night,
George came back late from the office.
Potter was bearing down hard.
Then came a war.
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch joined the Red Cross and sewed.
Mary had two more babies but still found time to run the USO.
Sam Wainwright made a fortune in plastic hoods for planes.
Potter became head of the draft board.
One-A.
One-A.
One-A.
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.
Bert the cop was wounded in North Africa, got the Silver Star.
Ernie the taxi driver parachuted into France.
Marty helped capture the Remagen Bridge.
Harry...
Harry Bailey topped them all.
A Navy flier, he shot down 15 planes, two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
- Yes, but George.
- George?
Four-F on account of his ear,
George fought the battle of Bedford Falls.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!
Don't you know there's a war on?
Air raid warden.
Paper drives.
Scrap drives.
Rubber drives.
Like everybody else on VE Day, he wept and prayed.
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Yes, sir.
This morning, day before Christmas, about 10:00 a.m.
Bedford Falls time...
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.
It's gonna snow again.
What do you mean, it's gonna snow?
Look at the headlines. The President...
I know, I know, George.
That's marvelous.
Commander Harry Bailey!
Mr. Gower, look at this, the second page.
Now, look, this is for you.
- This is for you. That's for you.
- Okay.
- Right, thanks.
- See you again.
Be sure you spell the name right.
Extra! Read all about it!
George, George! It's Harry now on long-distance from Washington.
Harry! What do you know about that!
He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?
Reversed the charges?
Of course it is for a hero.
Harry!
You old seven times a son of a gun. Congratulations.
How's Mother standing it? She did?
What do you know?
Mother had lunch with the President's wife.
Wait till Martha hears about this.
- What did they have to eat?
- What'd they have to eat?
Harry, you should see what they're cooking up in the town for you.
Oh, they are?
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home this afternoon.
In a plane?
What? Uncle Billy?
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- He stopped at the bank first.
He's not here right now, Harry.
But look, now, tell me about it.
- George. George, George.
- What?
- That man is here again.
- What man?
Bank examiner.
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute, will you?
I'll be right back.
- Well...
- Harry.
- Good morning, sir.
- Carter, bank examiner.
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.
My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor.
- The President just decorated him.
- Well, I guess they do those things.
- Well, I trust you had a good year.
- Good year?
Well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Yeah, very funny.
Well, now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Although I shouldn't wonder when you okay reverse charges on personal long-distance calls.
- George, shall we hang up?
- No, no.
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy.
You just hold on, there.
Now, if you'll cooperate,
I'd like to finish with you by tonight.
I want to spend Christmas in Elmira with my family.
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.
Just step right in here. We'll fix you up.
December 24.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter.
- Merry Christmas.
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter.
What's the news?
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey wins Congressional Medal."
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys.
You just can't keep those Baileys down, now can you, Mr. Potter?
How does slacker George feel about that?
Very jealous. Very jealous.
He only lost three buttons off his vest.
Of course, slacker George would've gotten two of these medals if he had gone.
- Bad ear.
- Yes.
After all, Potter, some people like George had to stay at home.
Not every heel was in Germany and Japan.
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?
- You forgot something.
- What?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Oh, sure, sure I am.
Well, then, it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.
How about that finger there?
Well, I...
Bailey.
Take me back there. Hurry up.
Come on, look sharp.
Take me back.
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter.
I got those books for you here.
Oh, hello, Vi.
George, can I see you for a second?
Why, of course you can.
Go on in the office there.
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.
You know, your nephew, remember? Harry.
- Here he is.
- Hurry up.
Hello? Hello.
Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.
I ought to have my head examined.
$8,000. It's got to be somewhere.
Here you are.
Character?
If I had any character, I'd...
It takes a lot of character to leave your hometown and start all over again.
No, George, don't.
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?
- I know, but...
- What do you want to do, hock your furs and that hat?
You want to walk to New York?
You know, they charge for meals and rent up there, just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
- Yeah, sure.
- No, that's a loan, now.
That's my business, Building and Loan.
Besides, you'll get a job.
Good luck to you.
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.
- Say hello to New York for me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, I will.
Now, let's hear from you once in a while.
- Merry Christmas, Vi.
- Merry Christmas, George.
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.
I'll be right with you.
Uncle Billy in there?
Yeah, he's in his office.
What's going on?
The bank examiner's here.
- He's here?
- Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...
What's the matter with you?
Come here.
Eustace.
- Yeah?
- Come here a minute.
Did you see Uncle Billy with any cash last night?
He had it on his desk counting it before he closed up.
Now, look, did you buy anything?
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.
Now, we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
- Right. This way.
- Come on.
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Yeah, maybe, maybe.
Maybe! I don't want any maybe.
We've got to find that money!
- I'm no good to you, George.
- Uncle Billy, look, do you realize what's going to happen if we don't find it?
Listen to me.
Do you have any secret hiding place here in the house?
Someplace you would have...
Someplace you hide the money?
I've gone over the whole house, even in rooms that have been locked since I lost Laura.
Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think!
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts.
Where's that money, you silly, stupid old fool?
Where's that money?
Do you realize what this means?
It means bankruptcy and scandal and prison!
That's what it means.
One of us is going to jail.
Well, it's not going to be me.
Hello, darling.
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, Daddy.
How do you like it?
- Bless you!
- Bless you!
Did you bring the wreath?
Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath?
What wreath?
The Merry Christmas wreath for the window.
No. I left it at the office.
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, it just started.
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's all right.
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy.
You can help me get this star up.
Way up at the top. There. That's it.
All right, fill in that little bare spot right there. Right there.
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?
We're famous, George.
Bet I had 50 calls today about the parade, the banquet.
Your mother's so excited. She...
Must she keep playing that?
I have to practice it for the party tonight, Daddy.
Mama said we could stay up till midnight and sing Christmas carols.
Can you sing, Daddy?
Better hurry and shave.
- The families will be here soon.
- Families.
I don't want the families over here.
Come on out in the kitchen with me while I finish dinner.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Have a hectic day?
- Oh, yeah.
Another big red-letter day for the Baileys.
Daddy, the Browns next door have a new car. You should see it.
Well, what's the matter with our car?
Isn't it good enough for you?
Yes, Daddy.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Excuse you for what?
- I burped.
All right, darling, you're excused.
Now, go on upstairs and see if little Zuzu wants anything.
- Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu?
- Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed.
Caught it coming home from school.
They gave her a flower for a prize, and she didn't want to crush it, so she didn't button up her coat.
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- It's just a cold.
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.
He says it's nothing to worry about.
Is she running a temperature?
What is it?
Just a teensy one, 99.6.
She'll be all right.
Of course, it's this old house.
I don't know why we don't all have pneumonia.
Drafty old barn.
Might as well be living in a refrigerator.
Why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly, crummy old town?
- George, what's wrong?
- Wrong! Everything's wrong.
You call this a happy family?
Why do we have to have all these kids?
- Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?
- I don't know. Ask your mother.
- Where're you going?
- I'm going up to see Zuzu.
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...
Hi, Daddy!
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.
Wait now.
Where do you think you're going?
I want to give my flower a drink.
All right, all right.
Now, give Daddy the flower.
I'll give it a drink.
Now, here.
Look, Daddy!
Paste it!
Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here.
Now, we'll paste this together here.
There. There it is. Good as new.
Now, give the flower a drink.
Now, will you do something for me?
- What?
- Will you try to get some sleep?
I'm not sleepy.
I want to look at my flower.
I know, I know, but you just go to sleep and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
It will?
- Telephone!
- Telephone!
I'll get it.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.
The doctor said that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner.
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.
Let me speak to her.
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?
This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.
Say, what kind of a teacher are you, anyway?
What do you mean sending her home like that, half naked?
Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for to have teachers like you?
Stupid, silly, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on?
You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids.
And maybe they don't have any decent clothes...
That stupid...
Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...
Hello? Hello.
- She's hung up!
- I'll hang her up!
- Hey, you! I'll knock your block off!
- What is that?
Hello! Who's this?
Oh, Mr. Welch?
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.
Give me a chance to tell you what I really think of your wife.
George, stop it.
Will you get out and let me handle this?
Hello? Hello? What?
Oh, you will, huh?
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time you think you're man enough, you...
Hello! Any...
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?
How should I know?
What do you think I am, a dictionary?
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!
Janie, haven't you learned that silly tune yet?
You play it over and over again.
Now stop it! Stop it!
I'm sorry, Mary.
Janie, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that. I...
You go on and practice.
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.
I'm sorry.
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing, Daddy.
What's the matter with everybody?
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
Now, go on, play!
Oh, Daddy!
George, why must you torture the children? Why don't you...
Mary...
Bedford 247, please.
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.
Hello? Uncle Billy?
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.
I need help.
Through some sort of an accident, my company's short in their accounts.
The bank examiner got there today.
I've got to raise $8,000 immediately.
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about?
- The reporters?
- Yes.
They called me up from your Building and Loan.
Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too.
He's looking for you.
Please help me, Mr. Potter.
Help me, won't you, please?
Can't you see what it means to my family?
I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan, any interest, if you still want the Building and Loan...
George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?
No, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the books.
I've just misplaced $8,000.
I can't find it anywhere.
- You misplaced $8,000?
- Yes, sir.
- Have you notified the police?
- No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.
- Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
- They're going to believe that one.
What've you been doing, George?
Playing the market with the company's money?
No, sir. No, sir, I haven't.
Is it a woman, then?
You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
What?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me?
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money,
Mr. Potter. You know that.
You're the only one in town that can help me.
I've suddenly become quite important.
What kind of security would I have, George?
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?
I have some life insurance, a $15,000 policy.
- Yes. How much is your equity in it?
- Five hundred dollars.
Five hundred dollars?
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.
You were going to go out and conquer the world.
You once called me a warped, frustrated old man.
What are you but a warped, frustrated young man?
A miserable little clerk, crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help.
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.
Nothing but a miserable little $500 equity in a life insurance policy.
You're worth more dead than alive.
Why don't you go to the riffraff you love so much and ask them to let you have $8,000?
You know why?
Because they'd run you out of town on a rail.
But I tell you what I'm going to do for you, George.
Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan,
I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest.
Misappropriation of funds, manipulation, malfeasance.
All right, George, go ahead.
You can't hide in a little town like this.
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!
How about some of that good spaghetti?
We got everything.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Dear Father in Heaven,
I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way.
I'm at the end of my rope. I...
Show me the way, O God.
Are you all right, George?
Want somebody to take you home?
Why you drink so much, my friend?
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.
Bailey? Which Bailey?
This is Mr. George Bailey.
The next time you talk to my wife like that, you'll get worse!
She cried for an hour!
It isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write,
- and you have to bawl her out.
- You get out of here, Mr. Welch!
Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink.
Never mind the money!
You get out of here quick!
- All right!
- You hit my best friend! Get out!
- You all right, George?
- Who was that?
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.
- He no come into my place no more.
- Oh, Welch.
That's what I get for praying.
The last time he come in here.
You hear that, Nick?
Yes, you bet.
Where's my insurance policy?
Oh, here it is.
Oh, no, please, don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.
- I'm all right.
- No, no, you no feel so good.
- Sit down and rest.
- I'm all right.
Please no go away, please!
What do you think you're doing?
Now look what you did.
My great-grandfather planted this tree!
Hey, you! Hey, you!
Come back here, you drunken fool!
Get this car out of here!
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Look where you're going.
Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help!
I didn't have time to get some stylish underwear.
Wife gave me this on my last birthday.
I passed away in it.
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.
How did you happen to fall in?
I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.
You what? To save me?
Well, I did, didn't I?
You didn't go through with it, did you?
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.
It's against the law to commit suicide around here.
Yeah, it's against the law where I come from, too.
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.
I knew if I were drowning, you'd try to save me.
You see, you did, and that's how I saved you.
Very funny.
Your lip's bleeding, George.
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.
Oh, no, no, no, George,
I'm the answer to your prayer.
That's why I was sent down here.
- How'd you know my name?
- Oh, I know all about you.
I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
No.
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Oddbody, AS2.
Oddbody?
AS2? What's that, AS2?
Angel Second Class.
Cheerio, my good man.
Oh, brother.
Gee whiz.
I wonder what Martini put in those drinks.
Hey, what's with you?
What did you say just a minute ago?
Why'd you want to save me?
That's what I was sent down for.
I'm your guardian angel.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money, $8,000.
Yeah, now, just things like that...
How do you know that?
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.
I know everything about you.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get.
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?
What happened to your wings?
I haven't won my wings yet.
That's why I'm an Angel Second Class.
I don't know whether I'd like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
Sure, sure.
- How?
- By letting me help you.
Yes. Only one way you can help me.
You don't happen to have
8,000 bucks on you, do you?
Oh, no. No.
We don't use money in heaven.
Oh, yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting.
- Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
- Oh, tut, tut, tut.
I found it out a little late.
I'm worth more dead than alive.
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.
You just don't know all that you've done.
If it hadn't been for you...
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off.
My wife and my kids and my friends.
I mean, look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you?
No, now, you don't understand.
I've got my job...
Oh, shut up, will you?
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.
Yeah, so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?
Well, I don't know. I guess you're right.
I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at all.
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That's an idea.
What do you think?
Yeah, that'll do it.
All right.
You've got your wish.
You've never been born.
You don't have to make all that fuss about it!
What did you say?
You've never been born. You don't exist.
You haven't a care in the world.
No worries, no obligations, no $8,000 to get, no Potter looking for you with the Sheriff.
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure, you can hear out of it.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.
I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid.
Must have been that jump in that cold water.
Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George.
What do you know about that?
What's happening?
It stopped snowing out here, didn't it?
What's happened here?
What I need is a couple of good stiff drinks.
How about you, Angel?
You want a drink?
Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry...
The clothes are dry.
What do you know about that?
Stove's hotter than I thought.
Now, come on, get your clothes on.
We'll stroll up to my car and get...
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.
You haven't got your wings.
Yeah, that's right.
What's the matter?
Well, this is where I left my car, and it isn't here.
- You have no car.
- Well, I had a car, and it was right here.
I guess somebody moved it.
- Good evening.
- Oh, say, hey, where's my car?
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.
I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree.
- What tree?
- What do you mean, what tree?
This tree. Here, I ran into it.
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.
You must mean two other trees.
You had me worried.
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.
Pottersville?
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.
I mean Pottersville.
Don't you think I know where I live?
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?
Well, I guess I just...
Oh, I don't know.
Either I'm off my nut or he is or you are.
It isn't me.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's.
- Well, come on, Gabriel.
- Clarence.
Clarence. Clarence.
That's all right. Go on in.
Martini is a friend of mine.
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.
- Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
- Want a martini?
No, no, Martini. Your boss.
Where is he?
Hey, look, I'm the boss.
You want a drink or don't you?
Okay, all right. Double bourbon, will you, and quick, huh?
Okay.
- What's yours?
- I was just thinking.
It's been so long since I...
Look, mister, I'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind.
That's a good man.
I was just thinking of a flaming rum punch.
No, it's not cold enough for that, not nearly cold enough.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it.
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves.
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!
Hey, look, mister, we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast.
And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere.
Is that clear, or do I have to slip you my left for a convincer?
What's he talking about?
Nick, Nick, just give him the same as mine.
- He's okay.
- Okay.
What's the matter with him?
I never saw Nick act like that before.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, little fellow, you worry me, you know.
- You got someplace to sleep?
- No.
You don't, huh?
- Well, you got any money?
- No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
Yeah, they believe in them.
Oh, why should they be surprised when they see one?
Oh, he never grew up. He's...
- How old are you anyway, Clarence?
- Two hundred and ninety-three, next May.
That does it. Out, you two pixies!
Go through the door or out the window.
- Look, Nick, what's wrong?
- Now, that's another thing.
Where do you come off calling me Nick?
Well, Nick, that's your name.
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there.
Come here, come here.
Didn't I tell you never to come panhandling around here, huh?
Mr. Gower.
Mr. Gower.
What... What did...
Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey.
- Don't you know me?
- No.
No.
Throw him out. Throw him out.
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...
Hey, Nick. Nick.
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?
You know, that's another reason for me not to like you.
That rum head spent 20 years in jail for poisoning a kid.
If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself.
Would you show these gentlemen to the door?
Sure. This way, gentlemen.
Stay out.
Get me! I'm giving out wings!
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the capsules.
What do you mean, I wasn't there?
I remember distinctly...
Hey, what's going on around here?
What...
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.
Look, who are you?
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.
What else are you?
What, are you a hypnotist?
No. Of course not.
Well, then, why am I seeing all these strange things here?
Don't you understand, George?
It's because you were not born.
- Well, if I wasn't born, who am I?
- You're nobody. You have no identity.
What do you mean, no identity?
My name's George Bailey.
There is no George Bailey.
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy.
They're not there, either.
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.
You've been given a great gift, George, a chance to see what the world would be like without you.
Now, wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.
This is some sort of a funny dream
I'm having.
So long, mister. I'm going home.
- Home? What home?
- Shut up! Cut it out!
You're crazy!
That's what I think. You're screwy.
You're driving me crazy, too.
I'm seeing things here.
I'm going home and see my wife and family.
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone.
How am I doing, Joseph?
Thanks.
No, I didn't have a drink.
Hey, hey, where did the Building and Loan move to?
Building and what?
The Bailey Building and Loan.
It was up there.
They went out of business years ago.
That sailor's a liar!
I know every big shot in this town!
I know Potter, and I'll have you kicked off the beat.
Hey, Violet!
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.
- I know.
- I know that girl!
Take a walk. Beat it.
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.
Ernie, take me home.
I'm going off my nut.
Where do you live?
Now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff.
You know where I live. 320 Sycamore.
Now hurry up.
- All right. 320 Sycamore?
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
- Come on.
- All right. All right.
Come on, Ernie, now straighten me out here.
Look, I've got some bad liquor or something. Listen to me.
Now, you are Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid?
- That's right, isn't it?
- You seen my wife?
Seen your wife?
I've been to your house 100 times.
Look, bud, what's the idea?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field, my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid, and I ain't never seen you before in my life, see?
Okay, well, just step on it.
Just get me home!
- Is this the place?
- Of course it's the place.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for 20 years.
- What's up, Ernie?
- I don't know.
But we better keep our eye on this guy.
He's bats.
Mary. Mary!
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!
Where are you?
They're not here, George.
You have no children.
Where are they?
What have you done with them?
All right, put up your hands.
No fast moves.
Come on out here, both of you.
- Bert! Thank heaven you're here.
- Back this.
Bert, what's happened to this house?
Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
- Watch him, Bert.
- Come on, come on.
Bert, Ernie.
What's the matter with you two guys?
You were here on my wedding night.
You, both of you, stood out there on the porch
- and sung to us, don't you remember?
- Think I'd better be going.
Look, now, why don't you be a good kid, and we'll take you in to a doctor?
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Bert, no, listen to me.
Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house?
Bert, listen. It's that fellow here.
He says he's an angel.
- He's trying to hypnotize me.
- I hate to do this to you, bud, but...
Run, George! Run, George! Run!
- Joseph! Help! Help!
- Oh, shut up.
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
I had him right here.
I need a drink.
Well, which way did he go?
Help me find him.
Well?
Mother.
Mother? What do you want?
Mother, this is George.
I thought sure you'd remember me.
George who?
If you're looking for a room, there's no vacancy.
Mother, listen. Please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.
I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.
Please let me come in, and keep me here until I get over it.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Well, I know everybody you know.
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.
- When did you see him last?
- Today over at his house.
It's a lie.
He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business.
And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Strange, isn't it?
Each man's life touches so many other lives.
And when he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?
I've heard of things like this.
You got me in some kind of a spell or something.
Well, I'm gonna get out of it.
I'll get out of it.
I know how, too. I...
The last man I talked to, before all this stuff started happening to me, was Martini.
You know where he lives?
Well, sure, I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.
- Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
- No, I'm not sure of anything anymore.
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.
- But where are the houses?
- You weren't here to build them.
Your brother Harry Bailey broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine.
That's a lie. Harry Bailey went to war.
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor.
He saved the lives of every man on that transport.
Every man on that transport died.
Harry wasn't there to save them, because you weren't there to save Harry.
You see, George?
You really had a wonderful life.
Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?
- Clarence.
- Yes, George?
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I can't...
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me, where is she?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
- I'm not supposed to tell.
- Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.
- You're not gonna like it, George.
- Where is she?
She's an old maid. She never married.
Where is Mary? Where is she?
Where is she?
She's just about to close up the library!
There must be some easier way for me to get my wings.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary! Mary!
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?
I don't know you. Let me go!
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary.
Help me, Mary!
Mary! Let me go!
Help! It's a wild man!
The wild man is chasing me.
Somebody stop him!
Tom! Ed! Charlie!
That's my wife!
- Mary!
- No, you don't.
Somebody call the police.
Somebody hit him on the head with a bottle.
You need a straightjacket.
Clarence!
Get out of here!
Clarence!
- Clarence!
- Right, that's you!
Stand back!
Clarence!
Clarence!
Clarence! Clarence!
Help me, Clarence!
Get me back!
Get me back.
I don't care what happens to me.
Get me back to my wife and kids.
Help me, Clarence, please.
Please. I want to live again.
I want to live again.
I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.
Hey, George!
George!
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?
Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll hit you again! Get out of here!
What the sam hill are you yelling for, George?
You...
George? Bert, do you know me?
Know you? You kidding?
I've been looking all over town trying to find you.
I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe you...
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?
What did...
My mouth's bleeding, Bert!
My mouth's...
Zuzu's petals. Zuzu... There they are!
Bert! What do you know about that?
- Merry Christmas!
- Well, Merry Christmas.
Mary! Mary!
Hello, Bedford Falls!
Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, George!
- Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, George.
Merry Christmas, movie house!
Merry Christmas, emporium!
Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!
Happy New Year to you in jail!
Go on home. They're waiting for you.
Mary! Mary!
Mary!
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
How are you?
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know, $8,000.
George, I've got a little paper here.
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.
Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!
Merry Christmas! Reporters?
Where's Mary?
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful, old drafty house.
Mary! Mary!
Mary.
Have you seen my wife?
Merry Christmas, Daddy.
Kids! Pete!
Kids! Janie!
Janie! Tommy!
Let me look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.
Where's your mother?
- She went looking for you.
- With Uncle Billy.
- Daddy!
- Zuzu!
Zuzu, my little gingersnap.
How do you feel?
- Fine! Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of...
- Hallelujah!
- Hello.
- George! George, darling!
- Mary! Mary!
George, darling. Where have you been?
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary.
Let me touch you.
Let me touch you. Are you real?
George, George.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
You've no idea what happened...
Well, come on, George.
Come on downstairs, quick.
- They're on their way.
- All right.
Come on.
Come on in here now.
Now, you stand right over here by the tree.
Right there, and don't move.
Don't move.
What's happening?
Who's gonna come?
I hear them coming now.
George, it's a miracle. It's a miracle.
- What's happening?
- What's happening?
- Who's gonna come, Daddy?
- Who, Daddy?
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody, in here.
George.
Here's everything right here.
Isn't it wonderful? So many friends.
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!
She told some people you were in trouble, and they scattered all over town collecting money.
Didn't ask any questions.
Just said,
"George in trouble? Then count me in."
- What is this...
- You never saw anything like it.
...another run on the bank?
Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.
Now, don't crowd. Don't push.
There we are.
The line forms on the right.
More coming, George.
Merry Christmas, and God bless you.
Merry Christmas.
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas.
Martini! Step right up here.
I busted the jukebox, too.
Oh, Mr. Gower!
I made the rounds of my charge accounts.
I'm not gonna go, George.
I changed my mind.
Violet Bick.
Oh, Annie! Annie!
I've been saving this money for a divorce, if ever I get a husband.
Merry Christmas.
There you are, George.
I got the faculty all up and out of bed.
Here's something for you to play with.
I wouldn't have a roof over my head if it wasn't for you, George.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.
Now, get this, it's from London.
"Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.
"My office instructed to advance you up to $25,000. Stop.
"Hee-haw and Merry Christmas.
Sam Wainwright."
And Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

Harry. Harry.
Looks like I got here too late.
Mary, I got him here from the airport just as quick as I could.
The fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard.
Harry, how about your banquet in New York?
Oh, I left right in the middle of it as soon as I got Mary's telegram.
Good idea, Ernie. A toast to my big brother, George, the richest man in town!

Most of these incidents are so incredible that one would almost have to be there in order to believe them.
You know, many people believe that we archeologists are just a collection of old fogies digging around in ruins after old dried-up skulls and bones.
Particularly medical men like yourself.
Isn't that so, John?
I wouldn't say that, Dad.
Not everybody thinks that way.
Oh, I could go on telling you stories like this all day long.
Personally, I think you're boring Isobel and her mother.
Who cares what happened 3,000 years ago?
Being my sister doesn't give you the right to be disrespectful.
- I'll have you...
- Now, now.
Are you two children going to start that feud all over again?
Oh, I just get annoyed.
So does everybody else.
Am I boring you, Mrs. Evans?
Oh, not at all. I find it most interesting.
And you, Isobel?
Oh, I should say not.
Please tell us the rest.
Hmm.
All right.
Well, we started out from Cairo to search for Ananka's tomb.
We weren't a particularly adventuresome-looking group.
There was Babe Hanson, an old friend of mine, a Brooklyn magician named Solvani and his daughter, Marta.
And, oh, yes, Dr. Petrie of the Cairo Museum.
We traveled for a long, long time through the desert,
then up into the mountains.
Babe! Babe, where are you?
- Wow!
- What happened? You all right?
I don't know. I started to hook the wire to the detonator to set off the dynamite and here I am.
Effendi! Effendi!
This is an unholy tomb.
It's the seal of the Seven Jackals.
What we've been searching for.
They mustn't touch it, effendi.
There's a curse upon it.
Oh, bosh.
It means death to whoever breaks that seal.
We can't stop now for a lot of silly native superstitions.
I have waited a long time for this moment.
The native workers fled, screaming something about there being a curse on the place.
However, it didn't turn out to be Ananka's tomb at all.
Easy. It's heavy. Watch out.
That's good. Look.
Whoa!
Why, it isn't sealed.
Let's take it off.
Careful, now. Careful.
That isn't Princess Ananka. It's a man.
And in the finest state of preservation of any mummy I've ever seen.
Later on, we found the most amazing thing about this mummy.
Doctor.
What do these lines in his face mean?
There's only one answer. He was buried alive.
He must have struggled desperately against those bandages.
What a terrible way to die.
Probably for some sacrilege.
Possibly. Have you touched his face?
- What?
- Go ahead. Touch it.
Feels like living tissue.
Exactly.
How true that proved to be.
Because, astounding as it may seem,
Kharis had never really died.
We learned afterward that Kharis was being kept alive by a strange race of high priests.
Only one of these high priests remained, a man by the name of Andoheb.
He and a servant kept constant watch
on our movements from up above in the mountains.
Very interesting, aren't they, Dr. Petrie?
Professor Andoheb.
Where did you come from?
The important thing,
Doctor, is that I'm here.
Then you knew about this tomb, and yet you insisted the vase was an imitation.
There are some things in science which should be brought to light.
And there are others, Doctor, which should be left alone.
You mean, we never should have come into this cave?
Since you are here, I think it's fitting that you should learn exactly what you've stumbled upon.
Come.
For a scientist, you are very unobserving, Dr. Petrie.
Why, there's a pulse beat.
Why, this is absurd. It's... It's fantastic.
In this vial, I have the fluid from nine tana leaves.
Nine tana leaves, Dr. Petrie.
That wouldn't mean anything to you, but watch.
Now, Dr. Petrie.
Why, it's... It's beating faster.
He's alive.
Let me go!
Get off! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
The mummy. Somebody swiped it.
Who could've done that?
- I can't understand it.
- Steve, Petrie!
What could've happened?
I don't know, Babe.
He's dead.
Go on and get some sleep, Marta.
We'll get a start as soon as it's light.
- Steve.
- Yes?
I wish you'd give all this up and come back to the States with us.
Well, I can't promise you that, but I will be back sometime.
Do you mind if I say
I think you're a swell person?
Hmm?
Well, after that, things happened pretty fast.
The next victim was my native overseer, Ali.
The same fashion as the doctor.
Marta went to bed that night.
We were all pretty jittery and...
Marta!
Babe.
When we got there, they'd disappeared.
Obviously, there was some sort of secret passageway.
I remained to search for it and Babe looked around outside.
The mummy, apparently, had broken an urn in passing.
And I examined the fragments and found a clue.
There was a secret passageway.
Steve!
Marta, what happened? How did you get here?
The mummy brought me here. He's alive.
Yes, I know.
Pop. Is he all right?
He's all right. Just a little shaken up.
Meanwhile, outside of the temple...
See here, you Egyptian Mickey Finn.
I'll give you three to tell me where she is. I'm not kiddin'.
We've gotta get you out of here in a hurry.
He's after tana fluid.
That's what must be in this vial.
And in the urn, Steve!
It's full of the fluid.
You mustn't let him get it.
Keep him away from it!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Well, I got Marta back safely, all right.
Brought back the body of the Princess Ananka, too.
But I've always regretted I wasn't able to bring back the mummy with her.
You can well imagine what a contribution to science that would have been.
The monster was really alive, walking and breathing?
Absolutely.
It's beyond the imagination.
The most amazing thing I've ever heard.
Why, it's like hearing from a world beyond.
That's the way it happened, and if Marta were alive today she'd tell you the same thing.
Nobody that ever went through an experience like that could ever forget it.
Well, at least I have the satisfaction of having destroyed a terrible monster, and in doing so, rid the world of an awful curse.
Thirty years ago, an infidel sought to destroy me and to destroy Kharis.
Both attempts failed.
The bullet he fired into me only crushed my arm.
The fire that sought to consume Kharis only seared and twisted and maimed.
Open it.
Kharis still lives...
Lives for the moment he will carry death and destruction to all those who dared violate the tomb of Ananka.
That moment has now arrived.
Once each night, during the cycle of the full moon, you will dissolve three tana leaves and give the liquid to Kharis.
Three leaves will keep him alive.
Nine leaves will give him motivation.
And now I leave in your hands the curse of Amon-Ra and the destiny of Kharis.
Preparations are complete to the last detail.
A position as caretaker of the little cemetery at Mapleton has been arranged.
Now swear by the sacred gods of Egypt that you will never rest until the last remaining member of the Banning family is destroyed.
Until they all have suffered the fate of those who dared to defile the tomb of our royal dead.
Swear that you will never betray your trust.
I swear by the mighty power of Amon-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world, and by the dread horror of Set,
I shall never forsake my trust as a high priest of Karnak.
And now, O mighty gods of Egypt, may you find in this young follower a successor worthy in every respect to carry on the sacred trust now delivered into his hands.
And save him from any temptation that might destroy him.
As it nearly destroyed me.
The ways of my people are strange to Western minds, but it is my duty to offer prayers each night, so that the soul of my dear one is not left alone to wander lonely and forgotten through the spaces of time.
Certainly. Anything we can do to...
No, there is nothing.
It is simply that not a single word may be uttered in the presence of Occidentals.
Very good, sir. You can count on me, sir.
I shall see that you're not disturbed, sir.
Thank you.
We are on our way, Kharis.
Now nothing shall stand between us and the fulfillment of our vows.
Nothing, Kharis. Nothing.
- How do you do?
- Good evening.
- You the new caretaker?
- Yes, effendi.
They wired me and said you'd be here.
I expected a much older man.
It's very peaceful here. I think I like it.
But it's such a lonely existence.
It seems strange to me that a young fellow like you would want to tie himself down to the job of a caretaker.
You see, there is a difference in our philosophies.
Here I continue close to the one
I admired and loved in life.
Have it your own way. I'm not complaining.
You understand what you have to do here.
- Yes, I understand thoroughly.
- All right.
I'll be getting along. Good-bye.
Bye, effendi.
Three tana leaves to keep him alive, nine to give him movement.
Kharis.
Kharis.
Kharis.
The moon rides high in the sky again, Kharis.
There is death in the night air.
Your work begins.
What was that?
I don't know.
Let's go home. I'm scared.
Vic. Vic.
Mmm? What's the matter?
There's something outside.
I seen it go by the window.
Seen what?
I don't know, but its shadow crossed my face.
- Ain't nothin' out there.
- I seen it, I tell ya.
I'm gonna phone the Sheriff right now.
Hello. Sheriff speaking. What do you want?
A shadow? You wake me up for that?
Go on back to bed. You must be crazy.
Whoa! Whoa!
What's the matter with you? Quiet down!
You're kind of cramped for space, aren't you, son?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Well, here goes.
You know, that's just perfect.
Even if you didn't ask me, as a checker player, I'd say you're a darn good doctor.
Three games in a row ought to prove something.
Yeah.
Yeah, it proves it's 11:00.
Ooh, I'd better be getting on home.
And I'd better be getting to bed.
You should've been there an hour ago.
That's what you get for having an older sister.
Now, Stephen, don't you start talking about ages.
- What's the matter with them?
- I'll run out and see.
- You go to bed, Dad.
- All right, son.
I'll be back in a minute,
Isobel, to take you home.
- Good night, Jane.
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Isobel.
- Good night.
King! Silver! Quiet, boys!
What's the trouble with the dogs, Jim?
They don't bark like that for nothing, Mr. John.
Something must have frightened them mighty bad.
Kharis!
Why, that... That sounds like Stephen.
Wait here.
He...
He's dead.
One is gone, Kharis.
One who dared defy our ancient gods.
Three remain... Only three.
And then we can return to the land that gave us birth.
Ah, this is just a waste of time.
Those marks left on his throat were nothing but dust.
You're the coroner and you should know.
Still, it might lead to some clue.
It's worth checking on.
I've tried to compare this with specimens of clay and dirt from all over this territory.
Seems to be nothing like it around here.
This is just another one of those fiend murders.
What reason would anyone have for doing such a thing?
You can't call it a fiend murder and let it go at that.
I don't intend to, John.
We'll do everything we can.
- Just let us handle it.
- All right, Sheriff.
Go on.
Well, you see, we were...
We were parked along the west county pike and...
What time was that?
Well, it must've been a little before 11:00.
We were listening to Jan Garber on the radio.
That's right. Then all of a sudden, a shadow passed over us.
What sort of a shadow?
Well, I don't know. Just a shadow.
Didn't you see what made it?
No, sir. We didn't look up right at once.
And when we did look, it was gone.
- All right, you can go.
- Yes, sir.
I'll send for you if I need you again.
- Vic.
- Yeah.
You called me about seeing the same sort of shadow.
I seen it. It passed right over my bed.
I seen somebody pass by the window, too.
- What did he look like?
- I don't know.
The moon was behind him.
He just kind of looked all black.
Anything else?
When we looked out, whoever it was, was gone.
Okay, Vic, I'll see you later.
I've covered a lot of murders, this is the first time I ever had a shadow for a suspect.
Might as well let the reporters in.
Yeah? What are you gonna tell them?
I don't know. Maybe they can give me a lead.
Okay.
Oh, John, are you still at this desk?
I've checked through every person that ever contacted him.
I still can't find anyone who would have reason to...
Look, John, you can't spend the rest of your life doing detective work.
All right, Auntie.
You're the boss around here.
What would you have me do?
Stop neglecting your practice.
Go down to your office and...
My dear, since this thing's happened, you've forgotten her completely.
I guess you're right, Auntie.
Of course I'm right.
You go on out there. Spend the day with her.
It'll do you both some good.
All right.
It's wonderful being with you again, darling.
Aunt Jane told me you'd called, but since that night
I've had so much on my mind.
Oh, I understand, John.
O mighty gods of Egypt, may you keep up my strength to carry out the mission entrusted to me.
Strength to resist any temptation which may be thrown across my path.
Strength to fulfill the destiny of Kharis.
I was wondering when he'd get here.
When does the train arrive?
Around 11:00, I think.
I'll run down and meet him.
You needn't wait up.
Oh. I certainly shall wait up.
Babe was always one of my favorites.
Suit yourself, Auntie.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
Now go, while the moon is still high in the sky.
Death goes with you.
Am I glad to see you, Babe.
I came as fast as I could, John.
How's Jane?
Oh, fine, considering.
Come on, get in. We can talk on the way home.
Very well.
That's everything we know.
Haven't been able to find a motive or reason or anything.
- Not a clue nor nothing?
- No.
Oh, yes, yes, there was something, but nothing came of it.
What was that?
A kind of grayish mark on Dad's throat.
Must've been a powerful hand that strangled him.
What did you say?
Kind of grayish mark on Dad's throat.
Clay or dust or something.
Grayish mark.
A grayish mark.
Quiet, King. Quiet, Silver.
Jim!
Jim!
Jim!
You are back, Kharis.
Now you can rest.
Rest until the moon is high again in the sky.
Two are dead and two remain.
It's no use. Hemiplegia.
Take a look.
It's a form of paralysis caused by severe shock.
Jim. Jim.
Don't you know me?
Can't you remember anything?
If there's any change, will you please call me?
I will, John.
All right, Babe.
Hey, look who's here!
Hi, boys, how are you?
Hi, Lefty, Joe. Hi, Peoples.
Well, Frank, don't tell me they sent you out on this assignment.
Yep. Had my choice of covering the Russian front or this.
I picked this.
Look, John, your father has told this story over and over.
Sure. When I was a kid.
He used to tell me fairy tales, too.
Yes, but this is different, and you know it.
Thirty years ago, your father and I met up with this curse in Ananka's tomb.
It wasn't imagination either.
We saw that curse bring on death.
We thought we'd destroyed the mummy in the fire.
Maybe it escaped, or maybe there was another one.
Oh, Babe, it's ridiculous.
Even supposing you were right, what would it be doing around here?
Where would it hide?
If those high priests could keep a man alive for 3,000 years, they certainly could figure out the rest, too.
Oh, Babe, listen...
The only clue we have are the dust marks on Dad's throat, and now on the throats of Aunt Jane and Jim.
It's not dust. It was mold that came from a mummy.
All right, Babe. Have it your way.
We can't go on arguing all night.
- John, will you do me a favor?
- Certainly.
Leave Mapleton. Go as far away as you can, as quickly as you can.
Why would I do a thing like that?
Because you're next in line.
The curse on that tomb extends to the blood relations of all the men that entered it.
- Then you're included.
- Suppose I am.
I'm an old man. You're...
Now, Babe, I've known you ever since I could walk.
I'd do anything in the world for you.
But I'm a doctor.
I can't believe in a live mummy.
Where are you going?
I'm going to find someone that will listen to me.
Someone that will listen to me before it's too late for all of us.
There was a gray mark on the throats of every single person killed in this town.
I know that.
And that mark wasn't mud and it wasn't clay.
It was mold.
We'll look into it, Mr. Hanson.
And we certainly appreciate your coming in like this to tell us about it.
Don't you believe me?
Well, now, you see...
Yes, I know.
You're a doctor, too, like John Banning.
A heart and lungs couldn't last
3,000 years. Go on, tell me that.
As a matter fact, I was just about to say those very words.
All right, don't believe me.
And don't do anything about it.
Wait till more murders are committed.
Look, Mr. Hanson, there are dozens of reporters here from all the metropolitan papers.
A number of them are razzing Mapleton about the revival of witchcraft.
I know that.
What would they say if I was to tell them that a mummy, 3,000 years old, was doing all the killing?
They'd laugh us out of office.
What will they say when they find out that I was right?
And that I tried to tip you off?
Give me a beer, will you?
Yes, sir. Coming right up.
Excuse me. Aren't you Babe Hanson?
- That's right.
- I'm Jake Lovell, New York Record.
How are you?
Suppose you're down here because of all the trouble.
Maybe.
Too bad about Mr. Banning and his sister, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Any idea what's behind everything?
I know what's behind it.
- You know what?
- I know all about it.
Only nobody will listen to me.
Look, friend, if you're after a listener, you don't need to look any further.
Now, what's this all about?
Well, it started 30 years ago when Steve
Banning and I discovered Ananka's tomb.
- Yeah, what's that got to do with it?
- Everything to do with it.
That tomb was guarded by a live mummy.
We saw it. We fought it.
You mean to say...
You think a mummy's been doing all these murders around here?
I know it was a mummy.
What a yarn.
It's gonna be a tough baby to sell my editor.
Give me all the details.
Well, at that time
Steve and I were young men.
Steve was interested in archeology.
I know. I know. I've heard that laughingstock routine before.
Now what do you want me to do?
Sure, the whole town's afraid of their own shadows.
I'm following up on it. Good-bye.
Sheriff!
It's out again. I just saw that shadow.
I saw it with my own eyes.
You saw a shadow. What else did you see?
- I didn't wait for anything more.
- That's fine. That's a great help.
Well, you don't think for a minute
I was taking any chances?
- Where did you see it?
- I was walking along High Street...
Come on. We're going back to High Street.
I've written hundreds of news stories, but never in my life...
The killer! He's out again!
He just frightened Nick Landsford down on High Street.
The Sheriff and he are down there now!
Thanks, Babe. See you later.
Kharis!
He's dead.
Look.
What is it?
I'm not sure, but I think
I know someone who can tell me.
Darling, will you drive me to the university?
- I want to see Professor Norman.
- Of course.
I'll call him and tell him we're coming.
Be out in a minute.
All right.
This powder, which you say was scraped from the gray marks on the victims' throats, is mold.
- Mold?
- Yes, mold.
Developed through so many centuries that it's almost impossible to calculate.
Hmm...
It's the same we find in this strip of linen.
What makes you so sure?
Well, in the first place, there's a distinct scent common to both of them. Smell it.
It's undoubtedly the odor of myrrh.
Comes from a tree known as the Commiphora abyssinica, which grows only in parts of Africa.
So?
This reddish brown resin is myrrh.
The other test tubes contain cedar oil and sodium carbonate.
Now, all those substances come from this strip of linen.
Look.
You can see that mark where the linen has been partially eaten away?
Yes, yes, I know. But what's it all about?
Where does it come from?
That mold and this strip of linen both came from the body of a mummy.
The chemicals were used for embalming.
There's no doubt about it.
That inky hieroglyphic there is the same that's found on the body of the Princess Ananka.
It dates back almost about 3,000 years, to the reign of King Amenophis, her father.
But...
Whether you are ready to accept it or not, we are dealing with the presence of the Living Dead.
Then Babe was right, and we wouldn't listen to him.
Well, now you've seen the evidence.
We've got to accept it.
Living or dead, I'm going after it, whatever it is, now that I know what to look for.
Come on.
- Telegram for Mr. Banning.
- Oh, yes.
Thank you.
The commission's just what I wanted.
But coming at a time like this...
I think it's wonderful.
Just what you've needed, something to get you away from here.
Nobody else could reason with you.
But there's one thing certain.
You know the army won't wait.
Three days. Hardly gives me time to get my affairs settled.
If you have any things that need attending to, I can take care of them.
- You?
- Sure.
You didn't think for one minute I'd leave without taking you with me, did you?
Well, you've just proposed and answered yes all in one breath.
Oh, Isobel, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so abrupt. I...
Now, don't go spoiling it by saying any more.
We'd better get started.
I have a million things to do.
Wedding preparations and all that.
John, maybe we'd just better go down to the judge's office in the morning.
Oh, no, we'll have it at home, in memory of Dad.
He'd have wanted it that way.
All right, John.
Kharis.
Kharis, come here.
They think there will be a marriage and an heir to carry on the blood of the Bannings.
They think that, Kharis.
This time, Kharis, I'm sending you upon a different mission.
One of life rather than of death.
You are eternal, Kharis.
Earthly pains and sickness cannot touch you.
Like the age-old hills of Egypt, you exist, you are.
The ancient line of the high priests of Karnak must minister unto you until the end of time, Kharis.
I shall do that for you, Kharis, I.
I am going to take on to myself a wife, Kharis.
A wife. Do you understand that?
The one...
The one who is supposed to be the bride of the last of the Bannings.
The one whom it was ordained I should find.
Turn around, dear.
Mmm-hmm.
There, I think that's it.
What do you think, Ella?
Oh, she looks beautiful.
How fast they grow up, though.
Are you sure you can have it ready for tomorrow?
Oh, heavens, yes! There isn't much to do.
A dart here and there, shorten the sleeves.
You're about the same size your mother was when she was married in this dress.
- Am I, Mother?
- Mmm-hmm.
Who knows?
Maybe someday I may be making this dress over for another young bride.
- Oh, you never can tell.
- Well, good night.
- Good night, Laura.
- Good night, Laura.
Together we three, until the world crumbles and there is no longer a stone or a rock, or a tree or a blade of grass.
That is my will, Kharis, and you shall obey it.
Bring her here.
Go!
Go.
You've been happy, haven't you, Mother?
We'll talk about that later.
It's time now you were in bed.
Vic. Vic!
There's that sound again. I'm scared.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Mother.
Sleep well.
All right now, men. I've asked you to meet me at the Banning home because we've got a terrible job on our hands.
And it's gonna require every bit of courage we've got to see it through.
Whether you can believe it or not, the facts are here, and we've got to face them.
A creature that's been alive for over 3,000 years is in this town, and it's brought death with it.
We've got to run it down.
Thirty years ago, my father discovered and violated a sacred tomb in Egypt.
Did I hear you say something about Egypt?
That's right.
I've been out to the graveyard, Sheriff, and I was talking to the caretaker about a final resting place for myself.
Yes?
And the caretaker spoke all about Egypt and quoted a lot of passages from his Egyptian Bible.
Then when I heard you talk here tonight,
I thought maybe he knows something about it.
John! John!
Oh, John! John! Isobel!
The monster took her away!
- Isobel?
- Yes.
John, give out those clubs.
Give out the torches.
Come on, men, get your torches.
Where am I? What are you doing?
There is nothing to be afraid of.
Nothing will hurt you ever again.
That creature.
Kharis? You have nothing to fear from him.
He has brought you here to me because it is your destiny to achieve the greatest honor that can come to a woman.
You will become the bride of a high priest of Karnak.
No. No!
For you, I'm going to forsake the teachings that have been handed down to us for generations upon end.
The secret that has kept Kharis alive all these years can be ours as well.
You're mad.
After I have given you the tana fluid you will be immortal, even as Kharis is immortal.
What I can do for you, I can do for myself.
You will bear me a son, and he will be brought up in the confines of the tombs of Egypt, even as I was brought up.
A new priest of Karnak who will carry on the ancient and honorable line.
No.
John and I, tomorrow, we're going to be married.
There will be no marriage between you and John Banning.
The sins of his father are upon his head, and only death waits for him, as it has for the rest of his family.
For he who despoils the ancient tombs of Egypt must die.
One day you will thank me for this.
Over here.
Kharis.
Take her out and hide her until I get rid of these fools.
Let's go in!
Open that door! Open that door!
Come on!
Open up! Open up in there!
Get something to break this door down!
Quiet! Quiet, men!
There's the man we're after.
- You gentlemen wish to see me?
- Yes.
You've some explaining to do.
What have you done with Isobel?
With whom?
Up to now, I've only asked questions.
Do I have to use another method to make you speak up?
Well?
I know nothing of any such person, effendi.
The mummy. Isobel. Through the woods.
- Banning!
- Well?
For those who defile the temples of ancient Egypt, a violent death shall be their fate.
Come on, men, let's go.
Over there!
If the mummy tries to get away, stop him with fire.
Watch the back stairs.
Don't let him get away.
Isobel. Isobel!
John.
I'm so glad we managed to sneak out while the folks are celebrating.
Hey!
Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
In every man there's an imperfection, a fatal weakness, a seed of destruction.
You discovered that, Foster, when you traded principles for personal glory.
When you sacrificed integrity for power.
You discovered that in eight short months, climbing to a governor's mansion from a district attorney's office.
District Attorney.
Hello, Jack, he's in conference.
Can I take a message?
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.
I've got the Beckhurst file for the boss.
- He's in conference.
- Well, can I trust you with it?
I'll take them in.
- May I?
- I guess so.
What if it is personal?
You're not an old maid, are you?
- The Beckhurst file, Mr. Foster.
- Thanks, Wolfe.
I don't suppose there's any secret about it. I'll be 48 next month.
Forty-eight. That's just about right.
That'll be all.
Right for what?
There's gossip around that
Governor Lambert's going to retire.
He's old. Pushing 70.
- The race will be wide open this fall.
- Very interesting.
I thought it might be.
I've got some more gossip for you, too.
A fellow of 48 could win.
With the right sponsors.
- Provided the sponsors are out of jail.
- They will be.
That's not the way the jury's going to feel about your man Hanson.
I think it is, after what I heard today.
Seems he had a subpoena issued for some books of his.
Books with figures in them.
Go on.
Hanson was going to bring them down like you wanted, only something funny happened this morning.
- They caught fire.
- I don't believe you.
Oh, yes.
I'd have brought them myself to show you, only...
I didn't think you'd want your office cluttered up with ashes.
- You're licked, Foster.
- No!
And you don't think so either.
Or you wouldn't be talking about governorships.
Let me tell you about that.
My people up here have been complaining about you.
Breaking their slot machines.
Closing the bookies.
Ranking off the numbers games.
It's cost them and me a lot of money.
Then Hanson. You missed, but I've an idea you'll try again.
Of course there's another way to stop him, but that's messy.
A lot of bad publicity, I don't think either of us care for that.
Faulkner, I gather you're offering me a choice.
A governorship or a shroud.
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- I don't want to put it any way!
Suppose you get out.
- So you don't want to dance, eh?
- That's right.
Maybe you will anyway.
- The Reverend Dr. Garfield.
- Come in, Tom.
- Trouble with Faulkner?
- Yes, bad trouble.
He and his man Hanson have outsmarted me.
- Sit down, Tom.
- How so?
- Fred Hanson's records.
- But you must have expected that.
No, not the way I had the thing set up.
Of course I wanted the records...
...but I knew if I went after them before the trial he'd destroy them.
So I built my case to look as though
I wasn't going to use them at all.
Figuring I'd array them later on when he was off guard.
One of my assistants secured the subpoena this morning.
But, got through to Hanson too.
Oh, I wouldn't worry.
You've made a fine record.
No district attorney in the country has done better.
No, it's not me, it's the little people, the corner grocer... the basement tailor, the one truck cleaner.
All paying from 5 to 10 dollars a week for protection.
From what?
Hanson.
Someday he'll overreach it.
- Some day's not soon enough.
I'm going to get him and I'm going to get him now if I have...
I'm sorry. Why should I be bothering you with my troubles?
- Did you bring the boy?
- Wolfe has him outside.
- Has him?
- He's a bit wild.
Well, that's why we have the club.
- Hello, Reverend.
- Hi, Matt.
Well, athletes!
What are you going to do, make me a boy scout?
- I know what I'd do with you.
- You aren’t big enough!
Come with me, Larry.
- Hey, Joseph.
- Yes?
Wouldn't the burning of the books be evidence of Hanson's guilt?
Would if I could prove he did it, which I can't.
It's a pity, after all the work you've done.
- Well, let's go in the office, Larry.
- What for?
Just want to talk with you.
- If that kid was mine...
- He wouldn't be here, Wolfe.
Sit down.
I'd sooner stand.
What they got you for, Larry?
On a rap.
Want to tell me about it?
Why should I?
No reason, except that I was once in the same spot.
Don't give me that soap.
When you were a kid you wore lace pants.
Listen, when I was your age I could lick every kid in the waterfront.
And most of the sailors too.
Lace pants.
But I'll tell you something, Larry.
I found out it doesn't pay.
Not in the long run. Not any more than what you're doing.
Do you know, if it weren't for Dr. Garfield you'd be in a reform school?
- What's the matter with reform school?
- You want to go there?
Sure. This is sissy stuff.
The guys in the block would laugh at me.
Do you think anybody laughs at me?
- No.
- Well, there. Why don't you give it a try?
- Say for a month.
- No, I don't think I...
- About ready to come home, darling?
- I'm always ready to come home.
Martha, this is Larry Price.
He's thinking of joining us.
Oh, you'll like it here, Larry.
Maybe.
- You look tired, dear. Bad day?
- Not good.
- Hanson?
- I'm afraid he's outmaneuvered me.
Oh, what a shame.
Joseph would rather convict Hanson than be President, I think.
He's the last of our evil forces.
He's the last and the biggest.
He's like an octopus.
Sucking the blood of every little business in the city.
You know, I'd give my soul to nail him.
- Mr. Foster.
- Yes, what is it, son?
- A man told me to give this to you.
- Thanks.
Listen to this.
If you want to nail Hanson, drop around at the China Coast at 8 tonight.
Why, it's almost as if he heard you.
- Son!
- He beat it.
- Joseph, you're not thinking of going.
- I would if I knew where it was.
It's a joint on Front Street.
Next to the M 'n R wharf.
Thanks. Now Martha, I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.
I'll run you home then I'll drop in on my anonymous friend.
It's probably just a joke.
- Bye, Tom.
- Bye, Joseph
- Well, Larry. Will you give us a try?
- Yeah, I guess so.
You must have had a tough trip, Joe.
- Yeah, two days out till the motor conked out.
Then the radio. For a week we drifted south.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Where'd you come from?
- Out there.
- Nothing but bay out there.
That's right.
I'd like two drinks.
Have the drinks brought to this table.
Some ginger ale and a small glass of Barbados.
- Barbados?
- Rum, my friend, a dark pungent rum.
- We ain't got none.
- I think you have.
A square bottle, you'll find it.
You'll find it, he says.
As if I didn't know every drink in the joint.
- Carl!
- What?
- Not even a dory out there.
- Huh? Well, maybe he swum.
Barbados.
Barbados, where does he think he's at?
He'll drink what we...
Bridgetown, Barbados.
Five years I've been here and...
Mr. Foster.
You're the man sent me the note?
Sit down.
Drink?
- Well, a little ginger ale.
- Here it is.
- That'll be...
- Exactly one dollar.
Look, mister... Never mind.
To your prosperity, Mr. Foster.
Before I drink to that, you might tell me who you are.
If you like.
Nicholas Beal, Agent.
Agent for what, Mr. Beal?
That depends.
Possibly for you.
"Foster promises clean city with Hanson conviction."
That's right.
Only I hear you've run into a little snag.
- Some missing books.
- How did you hear about that?
What would you say if I dig them up for you?
And why would you be so obliging?
I'm just a humble follower of your work.
Wayward boy set right, criminal successfully prosecuted and I...
...admire you.
Incorruptible enemy of the legions of evil.
It's a rather flamboyant way of putting it.
Perhaps.
But of course I'm not altogether altruistic.
I thought so.
- But you're interested.
- Naturally.
How much will this cost?
Oh, whatever you decide is fair.
That's a proposition
I can hardly refuse.
Shouldn't we be going?
Well?
Cannery records don't intrigue you,
Mr. Foster?
- Hardly.
- You may be wrong.
You'll find Hanson's signature at the bottom of each page.
And how did you happen to...
- Mr. Beal?
- Yes?
And how did you happen to know about these?
I hear things.
Of course I can't take them.
- Why not?
- Illegal, without a warrant
Didn't you say you'd give...
I believe it was your soul to nail Hanson?
Yes... yes I did but...
Mr. Beal...
Where are you?
Beal.
Beal!
O TRIUNFO DE FOSTER
Provas contundentes contra Hanson
FOSTER DESMASCARA HANSON
- What's this, Martha?
- I thought we might celebrate...
...Hanson's conviction.
Oh, sure.
- You know, I feel a little odd.
- You're not sorry for him?
No. It's something else.
Remember my telling you about
Hanson's account books?
Of course.
Well, there's something else
I didn't tell you.
- What?
- I stole them.
I didn't have a warrant to search the cannery till afterwards.
Do you mind drinking with a criminal?
- I don't know.
- It's not that serious, Martha.
But you've never done anything like that before.
I've never convicted Hanson before either.
Yes, I know.
But Joseph, next time, even if it's more important than Hanson, you won't let it happen again.
Not while I have a conscience and a wife.
You know, we ought to go somewhere this evening.
- How long since we've been dancing?
- The New York trip.
- That's 5 years ago.
- Yes, I know.
- I'm a pretty dull sort of husband.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
Mr. Foster, Dr. Garfield and some other gentlemen.
Oh...
We'll have the champagne after they go.
- Coming, Martha?
- In just a minute, dear.
- Aileen, did you fill the ice bucket?
- No, ma'am.
Well, the reform element seems to be out in force.
Naturally, now Hanson's gone.
Judge Hobson here tells me you did a splendid job.
Yes, pulling those account books out of your sleeve...
...at the last minute was a great piece of work.
Thank you, Ben. Sit down, sit down, gentlemen, the furniture's reliable.
- I'll fetch you a drink.
- Uh, this isn't exactly a social call.
You know there's a party caucus next week...
...and we're wondering if you have any ideas.
- Specially for the governorship.
- Well, uh...
What about you, Norton?
You know municipal finance.
You've been on the Board of Commissioners for the past 20 years.
I'd like to run... as Lieutenant Governor.
- Why not for governor?
- That's you!
Me? Oh, a dozen other men.
No. At the risk of turning your head I'll explain.
Hanson's conviction has made you a national figure.
And your Boy's Work club work is known all over the state.
We've nobody quite like you.
We sort of figured on hanging on to your coat tails.
Would you object, Joseph?
I don't know. It's a bit sudden.
I sound like a girl receiving a big proposal tonight.
I'll make a drink and sort out my thoughts.
All right.
He'd make a good governor.
There isn't any ice, my friend.
How did you get in here?
Oh, I've been here ever since you started dinner.
- That isn't what I meant.
- Oh, don't worry about me...
...I'm doing fine even without ice.
- So I see.
- Darling!
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know anybody was here.
- Martha, this is Mr. Beal.
- Pleasure, Mrs. Foster.
Aren't you the man who found
Hanson's papers?
- Did he tell you about that?
- Joseph and I have very few secrets.
You must be feeling pretty proud tonight.
He didn't tell you he's to be our next governor.
- Joseph!
- Martha, will you take this inside?
Tell them I have some business to transact.
Well, I suppose you came here to collect.
How much?
Tell your friends how you got the books?
No, I didn't.
Well?
We said whatever we thought was fair under the circumstances.
That's right.
Only it seems like circumstances have changed.
I've got a feeling your political career sort of depends on my keeping quiet.
Wouldn't look good if the people learned you didn't have a search warrant.
- How much?
- Make it out for $4,586.11.
That's absurd. We haven't got that much money.
Ask the governor to take a peek at his balance.
- You're $100 off.
- I can't be.
There's that check you gave me at the office this morning.
Yes, that was for a hundred.
You must have friends at the bank.
Maybe.
- Not backing out, are you?
- No.
- I gave my word.
- But Joseph, you can't.
I think Hanson's conviction is worth it.
Especially with the governorship thrown in.
Thanks.
Now, if you wait, you'll hear me tell my friends exactly how I got the books.
Well, well, I guess the reports weren't exaggerated.
Real integrity.
It's shame to take advantage of it.
First completely honest person
I've met in a long time.
I'm not surprised.
I'd kind of like to participate in your campaign.
I think we can do without your help.
- You don't like me, do you, Mrs. Foster?
- No, I don't.
Would you change your mind if I made a small contribution, say $25,000?
I haven't decided to run yet.
- You will.
- Don't take it.
- No strings attached.
- How do we know?
How do we know that you're not some kind of a racketeer?
My racket concerns good government,
Mrs. Foster.
- I don't believe you.
- No?
We don't want your money.
- You're letting her run things?
- I think she's right.
Okay.
But I think she's wrong.
Joseph, his money.
Mr. Beal.
Excuse me.
- Where did he go?
- Who?
- The man who just came out of there.
- I didn't see anyone.
Neither did I.
Well Joseph, have you come to a decision?
Hm? Well, I'll have to talk it over with Martha first.
- She makes the decisions.
- That's fair enough.
Yes, behind the decision of every man
I've found there's generally a woman.
Light?
Give me another bourbon.
- Hey, sister, that's not your drink.
- Isn't it? I'm so sorry.
- What happened to mine?
- I wouldn't know.
- Hijacking drinks, huh?
- That ain't all she's trying to hijack.
How did you get in here anyway?
- Look, piano legs...
- Piano legs? How do you like that?
Come on, break it up, girls!
Break it up, break it up!
Let me go!
- Take it easy, baby, you need some air.
Now scram!
Stray strutter!
How about giving a lady a hand?
Sure.
Feel alone, honey?
- I'm looking for Donna Allen.
- Well, that's me.
- I know.
- What do you want?
A woman.
Quite beautiful.
Wearing sapphires and silk...
...sable.
What are you talking about?
Come on, give up the gag.
Are you a cop?
Why don't you come along and find out?
You sure got a different line, mister.
- No key?
- Never use one.
Come on in.
Brother, what a place!
- Yours?
- No.
Looks like a dame's apartment.
- That's right.
- Who?
- You.
- Me? Excuse me while I die laughing.
Answer it.
Hello?
Oh... wait a minute.
He wants to know if you want some packages sent up.
We do.
Send them up.
Look, what's the deal and who's this girl?
- A girl who's had some bad luck.
- It sure must have changed.
I'll tell you about it.
Good family, two years of college.
Wanted to try the New York stage, only she got fouled up.
An actor named Boyden.
Boysie, she called him.
Only it turned out he forgot to tell her he was married.
One night they had a fight and he fell down some stairs.
Accident, they called it.
- Where are you going?
- Getting out of here.
- Where do you want me to put them, miss?
- On the couch.
- You want me to unpack them, sir?
- No, we'll attend to that.
Thanks.
Look, where did you hear about Boysie?
- New York.
- Are you a friend?
I met him once.
October 13th, 1944.
That's the night he was killed.
That's right.
- What's that?
- Cigarette case and a lighter to match.
Look at them.
Sapphires.
That's what I said. Sapphires, silk...
...sable.
- Put it on.
- No, it wouldn't be right.
Read what it says.
- Donna Allen. Oh look, Mr...
- Put it on!
Now look at yourself.
What do I got to do?
- Murder?
- Just the opposite.
Reform work in a boy's club.
- I'm sorry it isn't larger.
We ought to be paying you for all the work you're doing around here.
You know, this place is in order for the first time in 5 years.
You and poor Dr. Garfield are so busy.
I do hope you let me stay on.
We'd be crazy if we didn't.
You know, it's almost like a miracle...
... the way you just dropped out of the sky.
I did social work at home. I missed it.
It isn't a miracle.
Garfield and I have our own opinion.
The boys too.
Do you mind if I do something rather personal?
Something no woman can resist.
Oh... I'm afraid it's not very presentable.
Well, it doesn't quite match your personality.
You ought to wear something gay for once.
You think so?
Next time you go shopping for ties why don't you take me along?
I'll do that.
I hear you've been looking for me.
Yes, I was. I called the China Coast.
- Miss Allen, Mr. Beal.
- How do you do, Mr. Beal?
Glad to know you.
I've got something for you.
Sure you don't want it now you know it isn't hot?
Hot?
I hear you had the serial numbers checked.
- Oh well, Mrs. Foster thought...
- She would.
But the deal still goes.
You'll be needing money for your campaign.
I haven't even been nominated yet,
Mr. Beal.
But they're meeting tonight, aren't they?
Yes, but there's no telling what might happen.
- Oh, Joseph, it's 6 o'clock.
- Is it?
I'll get my hat and I'll be right with you.
- Hello, Miss Allen.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Something interest you, Reverend?
- I don't know.
Uh... you remind me of something.
Someone I have...
- That's not impossible.
- Would you mind telling me your name?
Around here it's Beal, Nick Beal.
I thought you two had met.
This is Dr. Garfield.
- I know.
- Well, we'd better get along.
- Come on, Miss Allen.
- I'm sorry if I seemed rude.
I had a strange feeling
I'd seen you before.
I don't do much business with preachers.
All right, fellows.
Form over here.
Come on, come on, Joe.
- Hello, Larry, how are you doing?
- Okay, I guess, Mr. Foster.
That's the ticket.
We have an old-fashioned custom here,
Mr. Beal.
Every afternoon at the end of the day, someone reads the boys a passage from the Bible.
And whenever it's possible we try to have someone different read,
It makes them realize that the Bible belongs to us all.
Would you like to read?
Me?
What do I know about things like that?
Oh, that doesn't matter.
I've marked the passage.
It's one of the psalms of David.
No. It's your book, read it yourself.
All right.
The earth is the Lord's...
...and the fullness thereof.
The world and they that dwell therein.
For he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?
And who shall stand in His holy place?
He that hath clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul unto vanity...
...nor sworn deceitfully, he shall receive the blessing from the Lord...
...and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek Him...
...that seek Thy Face. Amen.
Amen.
About ready, darling?
What in the world are you doing?
- I haven't got a tie that's fit to wear.
- What's the matter with those?
No color. They're drab.
They make me feel like a retired undertaker.
I'm sure the Whites know you're not a retired undertaker.
I'm aware of that, Martha.
But when a man feels gay he wants a gay tie.
Even if it is only to a bridge party.
All right, darling, I'll buy you some first thing in the morning.
No, you won't.
You'll have a picture of me as if I were a doddery old fossil.
I'll buy them myself.
Somebody else has different picture, Joseph?
- Why did you say that?
- Hmm... maybe intuition.
- Mr. Foster.
- Come in, Aileen.
There's a man downstairs says he has to see you.
- He's acting sort of queer.
- Queer?
Excuse me.
- Help me with these, will you, Aileen?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mr. Foster?
- Yes.
My name is Finch.
Henry T. Finch.
You got some place we can talk?
Well, in the library, but I haven't much time.
Well, I haven't either.
I got to get out of town.
I've been hiding, but they're on to me.
You see, they think I did it.
Did what, Mr. Finch?
I guess I'm not making much sense.
I'm nervous.
I was bookkeeper at the Highwater Cannery.
Kept Hanson's books on the side.
Let's go in here.
You're the man we were trying to find during the trial.
So were they.
The funny things is I burned those books the day Hanson told me.
Then you came up with them.
Same figures, same signatures.
I've seen the photographs in the papers.
Are you trying to claim the books were faked?
I'm not blaming you, Mr. Foster.
You had to do it to get him.
But you sure put me on the spot.
That's why I got to clear out.
A couple of thousand could carry me.
This is a very feeble attempt at blackmail.
No, you got it wrong.
I'm helping you. Otherwise I'd have to get police protection.
Tell about the books.
- Who put you up to this?
- Nobody.
- You didn't burn any books.
- Yes, sir. I burned them all.
Watched them go up in smoke.
Close as I am to you.
Maybe you didn't know they were faked.
China Coast?
I want to speak to Mr. Beal.
Nick Beal.
Oh, he's not?
Will you ask him to phone Mr. Foster if he comes in?
Uh... yes, that's right.
Thanks.
I wish I knew what kind of a game you were up to.
Darling, the Whites are here.
There's too many people here.
I got to go.
I'll see you at your office at ten.
I burned them, Mr. Foster.
Joseph, we're waiting for you.
- Yes, I'm coming.
- What's the matter?
I'll have to leave in an hour or so.
Wolfe promised to show me some papers around ten.
- There was a message for you.
- I got it.
- How did it go?
- All right.
- Is he going to meet you?
- At ten at his office.
Good.
Oh, yeah, I got the pipe.
I don't know why you want it.
- I collect them.
- Now tell...
Now tell me something.
You know I did burn Hanson's books.
- You don't believe me.
- Sure I believe you.
Then how?
He probably copied them before the trial began.
If that's so, he had to be smart.
- I'd better go. It's nearly ten.
- It won't be necessary.
- What about the money?
- I've got it.
Yeah? That's swell.
I was kind of nervous.
Only not here.
Mr. Beal?
- Yes?
- You forgot your pipe.
Did I?
I could sure use that money.
You've been trying to find me?
Yes, I have.
What for?
- I was talking to Hanson's bookkeeper.
- Oh?
- Thought he'd skipped out.
- No, he's here.
At least he's supposed to be at ten.
He has a very odd story for you.
Says he personally burned
Hanson's books.
Claims the ones we used are counterfeit.
Well, they worked all right, didn't they?
- If they're faked, I want to know it.
- What did the guy want?
- Two thousand dollars.
- A shakedown.
I'm not sure.
Why else would he pick the night they're deciding...
...who's going to run for governor?
- I don't know.
- I wouldn't worry.
It's a quarter past ten.
Maybe he won't even come.
That's beside the point. I want to know if those books were faked.
- What do you think?
- I'm asking you! Yes or no?
Oh, take it easy.
How could they be fake if they were burned?
By putting ashes through a printing press?
- I want a direct answer, Beal.
- Don't touch me!
I don't like to be touched.
Besides, what's the difference if they were faked?
I'd have to admit a mistrial and set Hanson free.
- And blow the governorship sky high?
- That doesn't matter.
I happen to have a conscience about these things.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Ben.
Yes, I knew the committee was meeting.
Oh, they have?
Well, tell the committee...
...that I'll be very pleased to accept the nomination.
If we can get all the churches in the State.
I'm starting a series of sermons on good government.
We want to blast Kennedy.
That'll be fine. Mimeograph this and copies of this to the Women's Clubs.
May I see it, please?
No, no, change this...
...for 'Joseph Foster means Good Government'.
'Joseph Foster' top,
'Good Government' below.
Print 5,000 copies to begin with.
- He hasn't come in yet?
- No, Mr. Norton, I'm sorry, he hasn't.
But it's nearly 3 o'clock.
Consider luncheon lasted longer than we expected.
Miss Allen speaking.
You'll have to ask him at the regular Press conference.
Hold it, Mr. Foster.
How are you?
- Hello. The committee still in there?
- They've been waiting for over an hour.
Let them wait.
You should have been with us.
A thousand women and ten thousand questions.
- The governor wowed them.
- I knew he would.
I wish everybody has as much faith in me as you have.
Everybody doesn't know you as well as I do.
Don't overplay it, sugar.
Sorry to be late, gentlemen.
It was an interesting gathering.
Joseph, I'm afraid we have some bad news for you.
- The Stafford report.
- What about it?
It indicates you're running more than
100,000 short of Kennedy.
- Couldn't it be wrong?
- It's accurate to more than 1%.
Hm, well... what shall we do?
We keep working and hope something will happen.
Kennedy's too smart for that.
- You've got just one chance.
- And what's that, Mr. Beal?
Make a deal with Faulkner and his downstate machine.
You're not serious!
- You want to win, don't you?
- Not that much!
- You couldn't!
- The biggest crook in the state!
This is the kind of people we're out to beat.
What do you say, Joseph?
I agree with these gentlemen, of course.
It would negate everything we stand for.
No, no, it's out of the question.
I'm surprised you'd suggest such a proposition.
Gentlemen, shall we consider next week's agenda?
Feeling low?
I'm disappointed.
You don't like the Faulkner idea, huh?
No, I don't.
Well, it's too bad because the deal's already made.
I set it up the day before yesterday.
You set it up?
No charge, Governor.
Beal, I'm gonna toss you through that window.
- I don't like anyone to touch me!
- All right. But get out!
Sure. I'll get out after I speak my piece.
- Whose team do you think I'm playing on?
- I don't know and I don't care.
I'm playing on yours.
I'm trying to help you.
I want you to be governor.
If I've done wrong you can repudiate it, and me too.
All right, I intend to.
And sell the State down the river at the same time?
You know, it's funny about reformers.
They're all color blind.
They see everything either in black or white.
No in-betweens, no grays.
You don't realize that politics is full of grays, all different shades.
Like in this case.
In order to do good as governor you've got to be elected first.
And to be elected you've got to make a deal with Faulkner.
Sure, that's kind of gray.
But it's white beside Kennedy's color, you know that, don't you?
Are you through?
It's funny about you being sore.
You didn't set the deal.
Your conscience is clear.
After you're governor, all you've got to do...
...is throw Faulkner a couple of scraps from the table.
Get out!
Get out.
I'd think it over.
Would you like to check these,
Miss Allen?
- They've been signed?
- Yes.
- Send them right away.
- I'll get a special messenger.
You've got a date tonight, baby.
Who with?
Next governor of the state.
Better get prettied up.
And don't forget the case.
It cost me three thousand.
- Good evening, Donna.
- Good evening, Doctor.
Oh, Mr. Beal.
I've been trying to place your face for over a month now.
Maybe you'd better give up.
Did anyone ever paint your portrait?
Yes. Yes, Rembrandt, in 1655.
No, thanks, Aileen.
- Darling...
- I'm not hungry.
- Something's bothering you, isn't it?
- No.
Joseph, what's the matter with us?
We used to be able to talk things over when we had problems.
It... it's not that girl.
What would she want with an old duffer like me?
I'd want you.
- Can't you tell me?
- Well...
It's that Faulkner machine downstate.
Beal made an arrangement with it in my name.
That's no problem. Issue a statement to the newspapers.
I don't know. It means giving up the governorship.
Is that important?
Yes. Yes it is.
It amounts to electing Kennedy.
Selling the State down the river.
I'd rather have you sell the State than yourself.
But that's not the point.
There are so many good, important things that I could do if elected.
Isn't that what Hitler said once, and Mussolini?
That's a lot of nonsense.
There's no comparison.
But they made deals with downstate machines too.
Martha, you just asked me why it is
I never talk things over with you anymore.
Well, I'll tell you. I'm fed up with camp, righteousness and sanctimony.
I'm fed up with preaching.
You're not a wife.
You're a missionary.
- Good evening, Opal.
- Good evening, Mr. Beal.
Tell Miss Allen I'm here.
Yes, sir.
Looks as though you were wrong about tonight.
He'll show.
- Put those down.
- Why?
I had Opal fix them special.
That isn't all that was fixed special.
- What's wrong with this?
- Same as with this. Too obvious.
- Now wait a minute...
- I know the deal.
A couple of drinks, lights turned low, half a pint of perfume and some sultry conversation.
- It's worked before.
- It might have worked a lot...
...but it won't stick. Not with him.
And I want it to stick.
Well, what do you recommend,
Mr. Beal?
I'll tell you.
He's coming up here worried and tired.
He's just had a fight with his wife and he wants somebody nice to talk to.
That's you.
I said nice.
For instance, if he wants a drink, you don't have anything like that in the apartment.
Then he'll ask your advice about a deal...
...I cooked up with a politician named Faulkner.
They approved?
Only first, you want to know what his wife thinks.
She doesn't like the idea.
You get sore.
Does she want Kennedy to win, does she try to wreck his career?
- Will you remember that?
- I'm a quick study.
You'd better be, because here comes the tough part.
He'll mention something about wishing his Martha felt that way.
And that's your cue.
- For what?
- Your big speech.
'Joseph...'
'I've a confession to make.'
'Sometimes I wish you weren't married so that we could...'
'I've shocked you, haven't I?'
- Me?
- Don't be stupid, that's you! Say it!
'Joseph, I've a confession.'
'Sometimes I wish that you weren't married so that we could...'
'I've shocked you, haven't I?'
'No. No, you haven't, because I have a confession of my own.'
'Each day when I go down to the campaign headquarters...'
'I'm afraid you won't be there anymore.'
'Then, when I see you, I know everything is all right again.'
'And the times we've had lunch together...'
Do you remember how many?
- Uh... six.
- Six.
'And each one a red-lettered day in my memory.'
Now you.
'Joseph, don't say any more.'
'Joseph, don't say any more.'
'But I have to. It's all bubbling out.'
'No, Joseph, no.'
'No, Joseph, no.'
'Why, what's the matter?
I'm frightened!'
'I'm frightened.'
'But there's nothing to be frightened of.'
'Please, Joseph, go now.
I'll see you in the morning, darling.'
And he'll say, I'll be counting the minutes.
Brother, how corny can we get?
Never mind that, just remember those lines.
Yeah, but will he remember his?
You must be out of your head...
...'cause he's not gonna say any of those lines or even a part
Hello?
This is Donna Allen speaking.
Tell him to come up.
Tell him to come up.
You'd better hurry up and change.
The black suit.
Put it on.
With you in here?
Okay.
Eighth floor.
- Is Miss Allen at home?
- Who's calling?
- Mr. Foster.
- Oh, Mr. Foster, come in.
I'll tell Miss Allen you're here.
Hello, Joseph.
I'm not interrupting, am I?
No. No, of course not.
I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought...
I'm glad you dropped in.
I was lonely.
May I sit down?
Yes.
Thank you.
You look tired.
I am.
Could I get you some coffee?
I'll need something stronger than coffee to pick me up.
Well, um... I'm afraid I haven't got anything like that.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you needn't be.
It's unusual and a pleasure to find a non-drinking female these days.
That makes me sound awfully old-fashioned, doesn't it?
No...
Sensible.
- You look worried.
- That's one reason why I dropped in.
Mrs. Faulkner?
- How did you know?
- Oh, well, Nick Beal...
...said something about her on the way out tonight.
- He seemed very upset.
- I don't understand Nick.
I'm sure Nick's trying to help you in his own clumsy way.
I suppose so.
What do you think about Faulkner?
Me?
Oh, I shouldn't advise you, Joseph.
What does your wife think?
She's very much opposed to Faulkner.
Oh, I can understand.
She doesn't realize what...
...what one has to put up with in politics.
She thinks I'm turning into some sort of a Hitler.
Oh, she doesn't!
She must know that...
...it would be far worse to let Kennedy win.
And then there's your career.
Doesn't she realize that this is only the beginning?
You're on the road to something really important.
I wish Martha felt that way.
Joseph, I have a confession to make.
Sometimes I wish that you weren't married...
...so that we could...
- I've shocked you, haven't I?
- No!
No, you haven't.
I have a confession of my own.
Each morning when I go down to campaign headquarters...
...I'm afraid you won't be there anymore.
And then, when I see you, everything is all right again.
And the times we had lunch together.
Do you remember how many?
- Six.
- Six!
Each one a red-letter day in my memory.
- Don't say any more.
- But I have to.
No!
- What's the matter?
- I'm frightened.
- There's nothing to be frightened of.
- Joseph, you'd better go now.
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Really, I...
I'll see you in the morning.
- I'll be counting the minutes.
- Thank you.
Nick.
Nick.
Nick!
Nick.
- You called, Miss Allen?
- Where did Mr. Beal go?
I didn't see him.
He's not out here.
We're ten floors from the ground.
How did he get out?
He could have swung across to that fire escape on the next building.
But it's sure a long swing.
Going out, Miss Allen?
Yeah.
- What's the time.
- You've just asked me that.
I didn't ask you what I just asked you.
I just asked you what's the time.
It's 10:48.
Thanks.
Wait a minute. Come here.
I want to tell you something.
- I'm a heel.
- Oh now, miss, I wouldn't say that...
Don't argue with me.
I'm a heel.
Admit it.
He's a bigger one.
Pushing little people around.
Making up speeches for them.
Sneaking up and down fire escapes.
What do you think of a guy like that?
- Well, I wouldn't...
- Don't interrupt me.
What was I talking about?
- Fire escapes.
- Hm...
Fire escapes.
You wanna know something?
I got one of my own.
I got a railroad ticket to nowhere.
Train leaves in exactly...
What's the time?
Ten fifty.
Twenty minutes.
I'm going to disappear in twenty minutes.
Think I was scared, don't you?
- Well, it sounds like it.
- Well, I'm not. You're wrong.
I'm not scared.
See this?
- Nice.
- It's not nice.
It's probably rabbit fur.
But I'm gonna take it with me anyway.
Services rendered.
Boys' clubs, campaigns...
Love scenes.
What's the time?
Ten fifty-one.
You know you're a great little conversationalist?
You sound just like a talking clock.
- Now, look, miss, I'm a...
- Give me a cigarette.
A cigarette?
Least you can do is offer a lady a cigarette.
You're just that type of...
How are they coming in in the 11th?
Can't you give us the partial returns?
Kennedy is leading by 2,901.
- How are we doing?
- Still quite close.
Yeah?
- Neck and neck, that's not bad.
- I'm afraid it is, Joseph.
- Why?
- Only five districts left...
...and the 21st and 22nd belong to the Faulkner team.
Kennedy's stronghold.
You'll pick up some votes in the 5th and 9th but not nearly enough.
- Something's coming through now.
- Pardon me.
- Martin 1,658.
- Kennedy 35,608.
Foster 97,493.
That's really pulling in, Mr. Foster!
- Uh, Joseph.
- Huh?
You didn't make any arrangement with Faulkner, did you?
No, Ben, I didn't.
Then he must be double-crossing
Kennedy in some way.
Kennedy 788,282
Foster 847,266
Congratulations, Governor.
60.000 ahead, that's wonderful!
Hello, Bill.
Mr. Faulkner.
Well, Governor. Looks like we're in business.
- What's that?
- Let's go over here, Faulkner.
Nothing from the 21st yet, eh?
Faulkner.
I'd like you to explain your remark about being in business.
That's what I said.
I wouldn't worry about the 21st.
You got the hats full there too.
That 50 grand you gave me to spread around...
...will pay off about three votes to the dollar.
You gave him $50,000?
- Where did you get it?
- From me.
Joseph!
It was only a loan.
I'll pay it back when I can.
Quiet! Quiet everybody!
We have some important news!
We just had a flash.
Kennedy completed the election.
Hooray! Hooray!
- Marvelous!
- Please, Governor, a speech!
I only want to say, you've worked harder than any group I've ever known.
You've been swell, and I won't forget it.
And I...
- Pardon me.
- Congratulations, Governor.
A wonderful night, Governor, a wonderful night!
- Let me explain.
- Good night, Joseph.
- Don't worry. They'll come around.
- I wonder.
Of course they will.
They don't understand.
You're elected, darling.
You're Governor.
Now you can do all the wonderful things you want to...
...and you'll prove how wrong they were.
How about a celebration?
This doesn't happen every day.
- Of course we'll celebrate.
- That's the ticket.
Listen, everybody. We're having a party at the Gold Room.
Music, floor show, all the trimmings.
It's on me.
Coming, Foster?
- I've never danced with a governor.
- Yes, I'm coming.
- With bells on!
- That's the spirit.
Hello?
Yes, just a moment.
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Foster is on the phone.
Tell her the governor is in conference.
And, uh...
Oh, no, no!
- Thirty-three.
- What...
- You heard me, thirty-three.
- Uh, let's get on with it.
Yes, Governor.
- Mr. Beal is here.
- Send him in.
Get this right.
It has to last two years.
- Maybe four.
- Hello, Nick.
- Seen the early edition of the Globe?
- No, I haven't.
- Something in there might interest you.
- Read it.
Independent Party disowns Foster.
In a move unparalleled in political history, the Independent Party today renounced...
...its connection with Governor-elect
Joseph Foster.
Superior Judge Ben Hobson disclosed that Foster's misuse...
...of unauthorized use of campaign contributions...
Let me see that!
The hypocritical old goat!
I'll ram that committee of his down his throat!
- Hello, Joseph.
- Well, I'm glad someone will talk to me.
- I've been wanting to.
- What happened to Ben and the committee?
Not one of them will see me?
I think you know.
Though I believe they would have overlooked the Faulkner arrangement...
...if you hadn't lied about it.
I didn't lie. I said I didn't make the deal and I didn't.
- But you agreed to it.
- Tom...
You and Ben and the others have known me for more than 20 years...
...and you now there's nothing to worry about when I'm governor.
I'll have to throw a few scraps to Faulkner...
...but that's all. Nothing has changed.
- You've changed, Joseph.
- How?
- Well, your clothes, for one thing.
- What are clothes?
And there are rumors about you and Miss Allen.
I know I shouldn't mention them.
Or the story that you and Martha are estranged.
Is it true?
In a way...
What's my personal trouble got to do with it?
They're all indications of change.
Then there's the influence this
Nick Beal seems to have over you.
Influence nothing.
He loaned me some money and I'll pay it back, and that's all.
I wonder. Have you signed anything with him?
- Any sort of contract?
- Of course not.
- What are you driving at?
- I don't know exactly.
But there's something strange about him.
- Something eerie.
- It's a pose to impress people.
How did he get out of your house the night you were there?
Why was he afraid to read the Bible?
- Are you serious?
- I know I can't be.
But I am.
And there's another thing.
Somewhere I've seen a portrait of him.
A medieval drawing or woodcut.
I'm trying to remember where.
- Drawing as what?
- Lucifer.
We're in the 20th century, Tom.
Nobody believes in such things since the Salem witch burnings.
Besides, aren't there a few items missing?
Where's the tail and the horns?
Where's the smell of sulphur and brimstone?
And where's the contract you're talking about, signed in blood and promising the delivery of one's slightly used soul?
Maybe the devil knows the 20th century too, Joseph.
I'm sorry about Martha.
And if people are talking about us, well, I'm sorry about that too.
Well, I'm not. You're the one thing
I'm not sorry about.
But Ben and the others, that hurts.
- I know, Joseph.
- The trouble is I can't give up.
I must justify the position I've taken.
I suppose there are other reasons too.
The idea of being governor, the flattery, having people knowing you.
The authority and the power.
I sound egotistical, don't I?
Selfish too.
No. Because I know you'll do the best job you can.
- I wonder. There's Faulkner.
- Oh, he's nothing.
And Nick Beal.
Yes, there is Nick.
How do you feel about him?
Oh, I don't know, Joseph.
He gives me the creeps.
Someone else said that.
In other words.
Oh, Joseph, I wish I...
You'd better go now.
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Of course.
And don't you worry.
Don't let other people make your decisions.
You make them yourself.
Promise me?
I promise.
Going soft?
- Where did you come from?
- Down the chimney.
- What's the idea?
- Oh, he's in trouble.
You bet he is.
- Nick, what's he ever done to you?
- Nothing.
Well then, why do you want to destroy him?
He's good, and he's decent.
Why don't we forget him?
Why can't we go off together just you and me?
Let him make his own decisions.
You and I could have a lot of fun together.
Don't touch me!
Don't ever touch me.
Why?
- Are you afraid of me?
- You stupid tramp!
I ought to toss you back in the gutter where you belong.
Keep in line.
- I'll talk to him tomorrow.
- You won't need to.
I'm taking care of him myself.
Tonight.
- Joseph.
- Uh-huh?
The inauguration Thursday.
I won't be there.
- Why not?
- I think you know.
- But Martha, you...
- There needn't be any talk.
- You can say I'm ill.
- I don't want to say anything.
- I want you there.
- No, you don't.
We're strangers, almost enemies.
For the last two months you haven't even known I was alive.
- I guess that's so. I'm sorry.
- So am I.
I've been thinking tonight...
...trying to figure out what's changed everything.
I can tell you. Mr. Beal.
No, that's what everybody says but it's not Beal, it's me.
I don't seem to want the things
I used to want.
Well, it isn't too late to change back.
I'm going to be governor, Martha, no matter what happens.
I want you to be governor, to be a good governor, with no shoddy alliances.
- You sound like that reform committee.
- Well I don't feel like it.
I feel sad. All the wonderful things that we've had are gone.
Do you remember the good times we used to have on $20 a week...
...when you were going to Law School?
And all the problems we used to share?
Oh, I know this isn't fair.
I'm just saying these things to prove to you that I want only the best for you.
- I know you do.
- Then you must believe me...
...when I tell you that Beal is dangerous.
All right. I'll get rid of him.
- You owe him $50,000.
- I know.
Martha...
Would you be very angry if I sold the house?
No, I'd be pleased!
And if that isn't enough, I've got the bonds Mother left me.
I don't deserve you.
Promise me one thing.
Don't see him again.
Well, I don't know that I can exactly...
This is the first really important thing
I've ever asked of you.
All right.
- I promise.
- Thank you.
Mr. Foster.
Oh, it's you, Beal.
I was just going to write you a note but now that you're here...
Save that for later.
You're in quite a bit of trouble.
I don't quite understand you.
Do you remember Hanson's bookkeeper and the coroner's verdict on his death?
Yes. Accidental.
Well, they put a new tag on him a couple of weeks ago and it reads murder.
Murder?
- Why didn't I hear about this?
- You'd be the last one they'd tell.
Seems like whoever tipped them off mentioned your name.
I only saw the man once in my life here in this house.
They know. They also know from your maid that you had an argument with him.
And from some bridge-playing friends of yours...
...that you left the house shortly before ten, which is when he got it.
- Where did you hear this?
- A friend in the Bureau.
Well, I'll tell you it's a very flimsy case.
Sure. Only they don't think so.
They'll be here any minute now to pick you up.
On circumstantial evidence like that?
Oh, I forgot.
They found something on the body.
A pipe with a silver band on the stem and three silver dots on the bowl.
It's been traced back to a set you got two, three years ago.
That's impossible.
How many pipes in the set?
- Seven.
- Count them.
There's one missing.
You had it with you that night?
- You don't think that I'd...
- I wouldn't know.
But I've got a feeling it's going to kind of interfere with your becoming governor.
For weeks something inside of me has been saying I wouldn't make it.
- I guess it's been telling me the truth.
- Not necessarily.
Unless I can pull you clear.
How?
You know, I've been sticking my head out for you.
Hanson's evidence, Faulkner, angles in your campaign...
It cost me a lot of money too.
Now this.
I'd like some protection.
And I'd like it in writing.
Joseph.
- What's Mr. Beal doing here?
- We're discussing business.
- But you said...
- What did he say, Mrs. Foster?
Martha, can't you see you're interrupting?
But you promised you'd have nothing more to do with him.
Maybe I didn't put it clearly.
I wish you'd leave.
You'd better read it over.
It includes a small reward for services rendered.
Keeper of the State Seal?
That doesn't mean anything.
- It doesn't even pay a salary.
- Maybe I like State Seals.
Oh, and there's a sort of default clause you ought to read too.
In case I fail to make the above appointment,
I do hereby agree to accompany the aforesaid Nicholas Beal...
...to the Island of Almas Perdidas.
- What island is that?
- Owned by some friends of mine.
- They need new personnel.
- For what kind of work?
Why worry?
The clause will never take effect anyway.
You can give me the State job the minute you become governor.
Yes, that's right.
But I don't like this anyway.
It's too ambiguous.
It might mean anything.
Will you want to face the music?
Mr. Foster!
Mr. Foster, there's a detective at the door.
He says he has to see you.
Have him come in, Eileen.
Mr. Foster will see you in the library.
- May I take your hats?
- No, thank you.
Come in.
- Mr. Foster.
- Hello, Lieutenant.
This is Mr. Beal.
Lieutenant Dodds and Sergeant...
- Sergeant Hill.
- What brings you out here?
We're working on the death of a man named Henry Finch.
Finch? That isn't the man who was
Hanson's bookkeeper, is it?
Yes, that's him.
It's a kind of odd story...
Uh, don't mind Beal.
It seems a harbor detail made a mistake a few months ago.
They figured this Finch fell from a pier down at the bay...
...and hit his head on some rocks.
No water in his lungs.
Then we began to hear rumors so we took a look at the timetables for that night.
- High water at 10 o'clock.
- The closest rocks were 8 feet under.
So he got knocked in the head before he fell.
Hm...
Murder, huh?
That's what the rumors said.
Oh, they found this pipe by his body.
Ever see it before?
I don't know.
Looks familiar. Looks like one of the pipes that was given to me in a set.
This set.
Seven.
One, two three...
Four five, six, seven.
Well, they're almost a perfect match, though.
You weren't thinking of hanging it on Mr. Foster, were you, Lieutenant?
Oh, no, Mr. Beal, we never really thought...
Don't apologize, Dodds.
It's your job to run down clues wherever they lead.
Yes, I guess we're both mad that this was a dud.
Well, we must be running along.
We have a line-up at ten.
- Good night, Mr. Beal. Mr. Foster.
- Good night.
- Aileen!
- Yes, sir?
Will you see these gentlemen out?
Your handwriting is very legible,
Governor.
Good, clear signature.
That's all but the last page.
- Take it down to the hotel stenographer.
- Yes, sir.
And rush it.
I'll need it in a half hour.
Good morning, Governor. Not much of a day for the inauguration.
No.
- You didn't eat much.
- I wasn't hungry.
Nerves.
I've been talking to the boys.
They'd like a couple of things more.
Two members on the Power Commission, two more in the Marshlands Committee...
...and Chairman of the Liquor
Control Board.
- That's practically every key post.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
You still have the Fish and Game
Commission...
...and me as Keeper of the State Seal.
- You didn't forget that, did you?
- No.
I'm sure you wouldn't want that forfeit clause to go into effect.
And the fellows think you ought to drop that 200,000 for boys clubs.
- The budget's oversized now.
- All right.
The cars will be downstairs in 20 minutes.
Well, I'd better get out the inaugural address.
Address? Didn't I tell you?
You wrote that last night.
A really first-rate job.
Good morning, Governor.
How about a picture for the Globe?
Your new home, Governor.
Think you'll like it?
Joseph!
Donna!
- I had to say goodbye.
- Goodbye? But why?
- Just a moment, miss.
- It's all right, officer.
Yes, sir.
What are you doing in those clothes?
Everything else belongs to Nick.
- To Nick?
- Oh, I'm so frightened of him.
Something terrible's happened.
Something he's planned.
Oh, Joseph, watch out.
He's a devil. He doesn't care about anything or anybody.
Better come inside, Governor.
Can't have you getting your feet wet.
You might catch cold.
You've got to park here, Governor, till the ceremony starts.
I think you ought to look at these.
Might interest you to see how far you've come in the past 8 months.
"Foster inaugural today."
"Foster elected Governor."
This one goes back to the time when you were district attorney.
"Foster promises clean city with Hanson conviction."
I think you can read the rest yourself.
I'll let you know when they're ready for you.
Mr. Foster.
Mr. Foster.
They're ready for you, sir.
...that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of Governor...
...according to the best of my ability.
According to the best of my ability.
Justice Fisk, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.
A few weeks ago, the Independent Party, whose candidate for governor I was, issued a statement... renouncing me for certain political commitments I am supposed to have made...
...prior to election.
I never answered that statement...
...because it is absolutely true.
Through greed, avarice, vanity, ambition...
I made certain alliances...
...with various groups of corrupt figures.
Alliances which I realize now...
...will prevent me from serving my state properly.
Needless to say, I am ashamed of myself.
So ashamed that I am taking the only action possible.
I resign the governorship...
...in favor of an honest man.
A man who was once my friend.
Lieutenant-Governor Paul Norton.
Congratulations, Foster.
Impressive speech, fine gesture.
- Virtue triumphant.
- Glad to find you take it so well.
Why shouldn't I?
- Your plans didn't quite work out.
- Just the opposite.
- They worked out exactly as scheduled.
- Except that you lost a governor.
- They're a dime a dozen.
- Maybe. But you won't get Norton.
No, I won't get Norton...
...or the State Seal either.
- We'll talk about that later.
- Yes, we will. Soon.
Martha.
Martha!
Hello?
Remember the forfeit clause in our contract, Foster?
Well, tonight's collection night.
China Coast at 11 o'clock.
Got it?
I advise you to be there, my friend.
And don't let the fog throw you.
It won't bother us.
Not where we're going.
Almas Perdidas.
- Not on this globe.
- Well, that's the way the contract reads.
But if the island doesn't exist,
I'm sure the contract isn't valid.
Tom, the things I signed in good faith,
I gave my word in effect.
For the last six months I've been acting selfishly, in bad faith.
Well, I'm through doing that.
I'm through going against my conscience.
Your conscience tells you to go with Beal?
Why don't you talk to Martha?
She's gone away somewhere.
Besides, if this is what you're hinting at, if there's something strange about it,
I don't want to involve her.
Then you admit the possibility.
I don't know.
- Do you know Spanish?
- No, why?
I wondered if you knew what the translation of...
...the Island of Almas Perdidas was.
The Island of Lost Souls.
Strange, isn't it?
- But that can't be.
- I know.
As you once said, it's the wrong century for superstition.
For werewolves, vampires and devils.
For even shamans in Black Magic.
But Joseph, I do know this.
Spiritual problems exist today just as they did in earlier centuries.
The battle between good and evil still goes on.
We all fight it, every day of our lives.
When you found the courage to renounce the governorship, you expiated your sins.
You confessed, you washed yourself clean.
That was your battle.
And that was with yourself.
Not with Beal. He can't make you go anywhere or do anything...
...if you're no longer willing.
Don't you realize it, Joseph?
You've already won.
Forget Beal.
Go to Martha, who remembers you as you were...
...as you still are.
She still loves you.
The two of you can make a fresh start together.
She's at my house.
Thanks, Tom.
Taxi.
- Hello, Mr. Foster.
- Hello, Larry.
838 Curserage Place.
- Dr. Garfield's house?
- Yes.
Sure that's where you want to go, Governor?
- Hello, Larry.
- The printer said to tell you...
- ...he was sorry he was late with these.
- Oh, that's all right.
Say, Dr. Garfield, that Mr. Beal...
- What about him?
- I never knew he was a taxi driver.
- He isn't.
- I've just seen him in a cab...
...driving off with Mr. Foster.
- Leaving, Foster?
- Yes, I'm leaving.
I'll see you tomorrow, Beal, at home.
- Think you get there?
- Of course.
Couldn't see him against the light.
- Is he badly hurt?
- He'll be all right.
- He only lost his conscience.
- I'll call an ambulance.
That won't be necessary.
I'll take care of him.
He's got to catch a boat.
What's the matter with that guy?
- We've got to find him.
- How?
That place that he first met Beal.
Joseph said it was his headquarters.
Do you remember the name?
No.
Try.
Perhaps Larry would remember.
If he's still outside.
Here we are, my friend.
Yes, brethren, every word is true.
I've worked in the darkness.
Glory be.
I've wrestled the devil and thrown him.
I've pinned his shoulders to the map.
Yes, I've pinned his shoulders to the map.
I wonder if he knows it's two falls out of three.
Not quite time yet.
Have a drink.
A glass for my friend.
Can't get through.
- We've got to.
- A man's life may depend on it.
I've got my orders, mister. Everyone takes the detour, just follow the signs.
As for your job you'll never miss it.
We've important plans for you.
Wonderful work, travel everywhere.
Good evening, Mr. Beal.
- Good evening, Cuthbert.
Good evening, Mr. Beal.
Hello, Foster.
Yes, you'll be a valuable addition.
Good front, inspiring confidence, people will trust you.
Shall we move along?
The last time I was here was quite exciting.
The city was on fire.
Picked quite a lot of recruits that night.
Had quite a transportation problem.
Joseph!
What are you doing, darling?
- Fulfilling an agreement, Mrs. Foster.
- No, he's coming home.
I'm afraid you're wrong.
He's given his word on paper.
- Right, Foster?
- That's right.
Joseph!
I doubt if he put his name on anything, Mr. Beal.
Oh?
Take a look.
Good clear signature.
You'll find everything else in order too.
Should be. My company has negotiated quite a number of these.
- Your company?
- A trading company, Reverend.
With representatives in all parts of the world.
Now, if you'll just return it, we'll be on our way.
Seems to be all right.
Sorry.
Pick it up!
Wait a minute, Tom.
Suppose you pick it up, Mr. Beal.
It's right at your feet.
Jockeyed me into a sort of a morality play, haven't you?
Only we have a pier instead of the nave of a cathedral.
But the props are the same.
It's always been bell and candle...
...and that worn out book of yours.
And it always will be.
I'm ready, Beal...
- ...if you are.
- No!
You've saved yourself just in time, didn't you?
But there will be others who won't.
A lot of others.
And I'll tell you why.
In everyone there's a seed of destruction...
...a fatal weakness.
You know that now, Foster.
You're lucky.
You're luckier than I was when I fell.
But that was a long time ago.
He's gone.
But where?
I wouldn't ask.
You won.
That's the important thing.
Forget him.
Go home.
Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
Good evening, Lily. How are you?
Glad to see you.
- Hello, boys. How are you?
- Good evening, Reverend.
- Good evening. Glad to see you.
- How do you do?
- Good evening.
- I see you brought the twins too.
They had to come out.
I hope they stay awake.
- Hello there, Jean.
- How are you?
Come on in, now. Take your hats off, boys.
Take your hats off.
You see, Reverend?
It ain't every Wednesday night a scamp like Little Joe comes back to the fold.
- Petunia dragged him in yet?
- He's coming of his own free will.
Well, I'll believe that when I sees him stand up and confess.
Maybe he's let Petunia down again, Reverend.
You better step over to the house and make sure.
If he done backslid, he wouldn't pay no mind to a deacon.
- You better go yourself.
- Perhaps you're right.
Petunia felt so sure of him this time.
- Now, we don't wanna be late, darling.
- Just a minute, Petunia.
Oh, the Lord won't mind if you ain't wearing a necktie, Little Joe.
- I found the tie.
- Then what you worried about, honey?
Right now
I'm wrestling with the devil.
While I was looking for the necktie in the bureau drawer...
...I also found two calamity cubes.
And I ain't thrown them away yet.
If I been redeemed, why ain't
I pitched them right into the stove?
The fact you told me you found them shows you are trying to be good, Little Joe.
- Evening, Petunia.
- Evening, Reverend.
Bring them along so Reverend Green can burn them up.
- Burn what up, Petunia?
- Oh, Little Joe found some dice...
...and he thinks the devil's got a toehold on him again.
But don't worry, we'll be to the meeting tonight.
Hurry up, Little Joe.
Reverend Green's here.
I'll be there in just a minute, honey.
I don't think any man could be very bad with you to take care of him.
Oh, I reckon he knows I love him.
Yes, he knows I love him better than anything in this world.
And he also knows now, when he gambles, he ain't never gonna win.
How did you convince him of that?
I just showed him he can't win when I ask the Lord to make him lose.
Is that why his luck's always been so bad?
That's the only reason.
He just naturally got a talent for gambling.
Little Joe would've won every two bits in this town if I hadn't told the Lord...
...I didn't want us to make money that way.
You're a wonderful woman, Petunia.
Only last week he bought an Irish Sweepstake ticket.
Got stuck up there in the mirror, worshipping it every day.
"Guaranteed by two dream books and a fortuneteller."
But I've been talking to the Lord about that.
It ain't gonna win either.
What made Little Joe realize the power of your faith?
I'll tell you, Reverend, it's like this.
I've been praying every day for Little Joe to get a job.
This morning he got one.
And that's finally convinced him the Lord's in my corner.
- Good evening, Reverend.
- Evening, Joseph.
I hear you've started to work.
Yes, sir. From now on, you can address me as "mine host."
- I've gone into the hotel business.
- That's fine.
He means he's got a job down at that new hotel downtown.
Yes, sir. I'm operative in charge of elevator number two.
That's gonna be nice for Little Joe.
That hotel's air-conditioned.
You know, honey, when I get rich in the elevator game...
...maybe I'll air-condition our residence.
This one's already air-conditioned with half the roof gone.
Well, it's about time to start the services.
- You'll hurry along, won't you?
- We'll be there.
Reverend, when you call on the sinners to confess...
...you'd better assign me the rest of the evening.
Oh, you're not that bad, Joseph.
Now, those who wish to start out on this pilgrim journey...
...we all will sing and join in singing the song of invitation.
'Tis the old ship of Zion come on, children. Come on, children.
Go ahead, now, Little Joe.
Go on, honey.
- Amen. Praise the Lord.
- Little Joe's joining up, Lily.
That's nice.
Wasn't a minute too soon, neither.
Don't whistle at me through a church window, gentlemen.
- Can't you see I'm busy getting saved?
- Now, wait a minute.
Wait with that "getting saved" business until you pays the money you owe.
- And you owes me more.
- You owe me more than that.
And you'll all be paid.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Wait a minute.
You can pay us now.
Domino Johnson's back in town.
Domino Johnson?
- You in fast company.
- Yeah, he's over to Jim Henry's café now.
Loaded with money.
- Give him my congratulations.
- He's raring for action.
- He won't play with any of us.
- And he won't play with me.
I got an appointment with repentance.
Wait a minute. This is your chance.
Your last chance to make yourself change before you gets repented.
Domino Johnson don't know you.
No, but you do.
And you know how unlucky I am.
- But this time, you'll play with our money.
- And with our dice.
And Georgia Brown will be over there tonight too.
Look, please let me go.
- Be yourself. You coming along with us.
- I gave up gambling for Petunia's sake.
Didn't you say you wanted Petunia...
...to have those nice things she didn't have before?
- Yes.
- All right, then, here's your chance.
Your last chance to make it the easy way.
Why, man, you can clean up big tonight.
Yeah, but they're waiting for me back in there.
Oh, you can get saved any day.
An opportunity like this only comes once.
Well, maybe I better cut down on my gambling gradual.
- What can I do, Petunia?
- Come on.
Come on, children.
Come on to the Lord. Peace.
Lily.
- Little Joe ain't there.
- Ain't he?
- Well, he was here when the others got up.
- Maybe he's a little shy.
He must be waiting outside.
Come with me, Lily. I'm scared.
Little Joe?
Little Joe?
- He wouldn't go to...
- Well, you know that Little Joe.
No. He wouldn't do that.
He must have gone home.
Come on, Lily.
But, Petunia...
Little Joe? Little Joe?
Little Joe!
He ain't here.
Lily, something awful's happened to Little Joe.
Petunia.
I got in a little trouble again, honey.
Little Joe!
I think he'll pull through.
We'll know in the morning.
- But can I go in, doctor?
- Yes, you may, Petunia.
But don't try to talk to him, because he'll be out of his head.
Lord.
A fool.
Fool.
No, no. No.
Lord...
...please don't take Little Joe from me.
I know how sinful he's been lately, but I love him.
And please forgive me for loving him so much.
But Little Joe ain't wicked.
He's just weak.
And if he dies now, the devil's going to get him sure.
And he don't deserve to be in a mess like that. Little Joe ain't that bad.
So if you'll just let him get well again...
...I promise you he'll mend his ways and give you no more trouble.
Amen.
Those ain't my dice.
He's got a... He's got a gun.
Who's there?
Don't let him in here. I don't know you.
Get him out of here.
Little Joe...
...rise up from that bed and report for duty.
Report? Report where?
Now, where do you suppose you'd be reporting?
A shiftless no-account like you is.
- Get up.
- I can't get up from this bed.
- I'm a very sick man.
- Little Joe, you ain't sick no more.
You are dead.
What are you doing here, Lucius?
What's that you called me?
Ain't you my old friend Lucius Ferry?
Lucius Fe...
You are speaking to Lucifer Jr.
Joe, the asbestos chariot is awaiting.
- Come on, grab him and let's get going.
- No, no!
- Come on.
- I ain't dead. I don't feel dead.
If you ain't...
...who is that laying in that bed?
That's me.
That's right.
Then who do you think you are?
I don't know.
I ain't never been twins before.
And you still ain't twins.
You's the spirit of that body, Little Joe.
And you're the one we've come for.
Petunia.
Petunia, don't let them get me.
Petunia can't hear you now.
Boy, you is gone.
Here I is, Petunia.
Don't look at him. Look at me.
How you expect Petunia to see your spirit?
To her, you just a hunk of thin air.
- Little Joe, your hands is cold.
- Course they is. I'm dead.
Oh, Lord, something's wrong down here. I feel it.
- You ain't gonna let him die, are you?
- That's right, Petunia, pray.
Pray harder. You's a faithful servant.
If Little Joe dies,
I ain't got nothing left to live for.
Don't let up, Petunia.
Keep plugging. Keep plugging for me.
I know you hear me.
If you save him on earth for me...
...I’m gonna save him for you up in heaven.
That is terrific praying.
Come on, grab this rascal.
Let's get him out of here.
- No!
- Get that leg. Take him on out of there.
Get the legs, number four. Pull him around.
Don't let him switch up on you like that!
What's going on here?
I'm in an awful mess.
Reverend?
Who gave you orders to incinerate this man?
We got our orders direct from the hot seat, from the big boss hisself.
And you better keep out of this.
- You're Lucifer's boy, aren't you?
- I am.
Look like old Lucifer been jumping the gun again.
Oh, no, he haven't either. Little Joe here's been 1-A on our list for a long time.
You've had lots of souls that you didn't get.
Yes, I knows that, but Little Joe never did do any repenting until after he was dead.
That don't count and you knows it.
What are you doing down here?
Answer me that.
I'll tell you.
We received a powerful prayer from Petunia here.
It was the most powerful piece of praying...
...we's heard up there in a long time.
- I was afraid of that.
Now, if you coal-heavers don't lay off while we investigate...
...you gonna have some explaining to do.
You don't have to check up on me,
Reverend. You know I been reforming.
I know very little about you, Joseph.
Ain't you the reverend in our church?
I am a soldier of the Lord.
And nothing must be done till I look into this case.
Don't let him bluff you.
We've been wanting to tangle with them birds for a long time.
Now wait a minute here.
What's the reason we can't talk this thing over sensible-like?
Now, what does your boss want with a no-account like Little Joe?
- You knows by rights he belongs to us.
- No, I don't, general.
And I thank you for letting me come with you.
Wait a minute, Joseph. Not so fast.
I was told to investigate, not to bring you up there.
But you won't be taking no chances, sir.
I can be a very handy man up there.
I can run the elevator...
...going up, tune harps and mind cherubs, or anything.
First thing you know, you'll have a bunch of dice-shooting angels on your hands.
Don't listen to him. Listen to Petunia.
- She knows how hard I been...
- Quiet.
I am listening to her.
Lord, if you just let him get well again...
...I promise you I'll get him back in the fold.
- But I promise you...
- Hold on here.
How come Petunia there knows what we're talking about?
I don't know.
Petunia's always been in pretty close touch with the Lord.
But this is a new one on me.
Looks like the Lord is letting her in on something.
That's strictly against the rules for human beings down here.
This is a problem.
Sergeant Fleetfoot.
- Yes, sir.
- Better zoom up...
...and get a firsthand judgment from the Lord.
Yes, sir. I won't be a minute, general.
- No stunting, now.
- Oh, no, sir.
Now, what for you wanna go through all this rigmarole?
You just messing up the bookkeeping.
I tell you what I'll do.
- I'll shoot you for him.
- Okay, you're faded.
Oh, no, Little Joe. Not you, him.
- You're a lot of trouble to us, Little Joe.
- Trouble?
Just wait until your boss starts checking up on his carryings-on with Georgia Brown.
Maybe you didn't know she's my pappy's favorite child.
We know all about that Georgia Brown affair.
- It's a long black mark against you.
- Little Joe just weak.
He was trying to get away from that old Georgia Brown...
...but she just overpowered him.
This coaching from the sideline has gotta stop.
That's dirty pool and you knows it.
Petunia's right, sir.
I was trying to get rid of that woman.
And I was making headway too.
Why, only last week
I says to her... I says:
"Georgia, we can't go on like this.
Why, it's grieving poor Petunia something fierce."
Oh, Little Joe, careful, now.
Well, that's what I thought anyhow.
Don't forget, we can read your thoughts up there too.
Well, that's what I ought to thought.
Little Joe, we's gonna have
Georgia Brown with us before long.
You are, sure enough?
Makes no neverminds to me.
No, sir.
That's right where she belongs.
Little Joe, that thought that weaseled through your soul just now...
...convinces me that you're not fit to associate with our folks up there.
It's just too dangerous.
Oh, my.
I'm just about the most miserablest person what ever died.
Boy, you ain't half as miserable as you gonna be.
Petunia!
Petunia, help!
Little Joe, you ain't breathing.
- Lily, Lily!
- I heard you, Petunia.
Oh, Lord, you ain't gonna let him die.
You ain't forsaken me, have you?
Lily! Little Joe ain't breathing.
- I'm afraid it's all over now, Petunia.
- Don't say that.
The Lord's not taken Little Joe from me so I won't see him again.
You better come get some rest.
If it wasn't for the best, the Lord never would've let this happen to you.
No.
Lord, I've heard your voice.
And I'm hanging on to my faith in you, no matter what happens.
- But don't take Little Joe from me.
- Okay. It's all right.
Don't take him.
You certainly have been a heartache to her, Little Joe.
General, I'm a rat.
Sergeant Fleetfoot, you made good time.
The flying was good, general.
- Tail wind all the way.
- What's the Lord's verdict?
The Lord said Little Joe ain't no fit company for our folks.
Oh, me. The jig's up.
But you ain't heard the whole thing out yet.
- There's a proviso.
- A what?
Quote, "on account of Petunia praying so hard...
...the Lord done give him leave to stay on this earth for six months more.
If he whitewash his soul in that time...
...he makes the grade with heaven."
- And what if he don't?
"Lucifer Sr.
Gets permanent control," unquote.
- You know Little Joe's never gonna change.
- Oh, yes, I can.
I done changed already. Yes, sir.
I'll spread the light and preach the word. Hallelujah.
Wait a minute, Little Joe.
There's one catch in this.
You're not gonna remember anything...
...when you wake up and become alive again.
- I ain't?
- No, you're not.
You see, your human mind is gonna be blank about all this.
Your human mind is over there in your human body.
How am I gonna reform if I don't remember...
...what a mess I was in when I was dead?
- It's gonna be like this, Little Joe.
We're gonna be around telling your conscience the right thing to do.
Of course, you won't see us, but we'll be there.
And is he gonna be around telling my conscience the wrong thing to do?
Oh, I'll be there, all right.
You can depend on that.
That's bad.
Well, I'll be seeing you, Little Joe.
So long.
We'll give him a fight.
Go back, Little Joe, to your human body.
I hope that in this second life...
...you fight a good fight.
I'll be in there pitching, general.
Good luck, Little Joe.
- Petunia! Petunia!
- Great day in the morning.
Here I am, darling.
- Little Joe.
- Petunia.
- You're alive.
- Oh, Lord. This is sure enough a miracle.
- I'll get the doctor.
- We don't need the doctor.
Tell the reverend, tell everybody.
Little Joe's all right.
Lord, I thank you. And right now
I'm so happy, I can't talk.
But I know you understand.
- Petunia.
- Don't move.
Be quiet.
Good morning, Petunia.
You're looking mighty happy this morning.
I was till this minute. What you and Dude coming here for, Jim Henry?
We is devotees of good singing.
But you ain't here because you're music lovers.
We was just wondering how Little Joe's getting along.
Oh, Little Joe just getting along fine.
Doc Jones says he'll be up and about soon.
I'm seeing to it he don't get mixed up with you and your crowd again.
That suits us. But there's a little business matter we'd like to take up with him.
We didn't want to bother Little Joe till he got better...
...but it's been over a month now.
Very thoughtful of you.
I suppose this business matter is money?
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I has the loU right here for...
- Four dollars. And you?
- Six.
Well, Jim Henry...
...you being such a bigtime sport...
...you wouldn't take advantage of somebody like me...
...who don't know nothing about gambling?
- No, no.
- Well, I tell you what.
Suppose we shoot your dice for,
I think the phrase is, "double or nothing"...
...for that money Little Joe owes you.
- That sounds fair enough.
And to show you that we mean you good, we gonna let you roll them.
You mean I can throw them down there on the ground?
- Yeah, sort of out of the way.
- I see.
- Now, look, I can practice a little bit?
- Oh, that's perfectly all right.
- A one and another one.
- That's snake eyes.
- Is that bad?
- It ain't good.
- A two and a one. What's that?
- That's bad news again.
Look here. Ain't there no good news on these things?
Oh, yes, the number's there if you is lucky.
Something tells me I ain't lucky.
Let me see you roll them, Jim Henry.
Anything to pleasure a lady.
You got your money, ain't you?
- Why, of course.
- Well, all you have to do...
...is to lay your money on the ground.
Well, coming at you.
Your announcer is Jim Henry.
Big natural, dice.
- What's the matter?
- I done changed my mind.
- I think I'll roll them myself.
- But you passed the dice to me.
I know, and now I'm passing the dice back to me.
- And these the same dice I had before?
- Oh, yes.
- All right...
- You don't wanna tire yourself out.
Oh, ladies first, Jim Henry.
Never forget your manners.
This time it's for keeps.
Seven.
Ain't that funny how my luck done changed all of a sudden?
I guess I'm just dumb and lucky.
That takes care of you business, little Jim Henry.
Now, put your money down here so I can take charge of you, son.
I... I... I think I'm gonna let mine ride.
You must have thought that
I didn't hear myself speak.
- Read it.
- Eleven.
Correct. Switch dice on me, will you?
That's the stuff you been pulling off on Little Joe. Get out of here, you two.
If I catch you here again,
I'll set the law on you.
Oh, Lord.
Please forgive me for backsliding.
But sometimes when you fight the devil...
...you got to jab him with his own pitchfork.
- You know something, Petunia?
- What?
When I gets recovered...
...I ain't gonna let you break your back working for me.
Oh, I don't mind, sugar, long as it's you I'm working for.
Well, I'm gonna be good to you from now on.
I'm gonna buy you electric washing machine.
You ain't gonna do nobody's scrubbing but your own.
Sure enough? Little Joe, you just about to kill me with kindness.
Oh, Petunia, you know I ain't never done nothing for you before.
Why you've worked your fingers to the bone to see that I had a pleasant recuperation.
You snatched me from the clutches of all those hoodlums I ran with.
I tell you, I feel like a new man.
And that's just the way you gonna continue to be.
How do you know that?
Oh, the Lord gives me proof in here.
How do you mean?
Little Joe, when you're good...
...something in here starts singing.
And the Lord seems to say,
"Petunia...
...all my angels are playing beautiful music...
...because they feel so happy for you.
Can you hear it down there?"
And I listen.
And sure enough I hear it as plain as if I was up in heaven myself...
...and they were teaching me their prettiest tunes.
Then I realize that's the Lord's way of telling me to be happy.
Petunia, how many tunes do you suppose the angels know?
Well, nobody can say that down here.
But if you just keep on being good...
...me and you gonna hear them together someday.
You mean way up there in the deep blue?
- You suppose they'll let us be together?
- Of course they will.
If we do the job right here, they won't let us down...
...when we're finally ready to go home.
Do you reckon the angels know any of the songs you sing?
They sure do.
Oh, I suppose they do sing awful pretty.
But I'd rather hear you any day.
Boogie!
Oh, boogie, boy.
Hey! Stop that noise!
What's going on around here?
Is this what you calls office efficiency?
- You imps is supposed to be working.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Well, boys, we's on the spot.
Pappy said we gotta get Little Joe, or I ain't gonna be the head man around here.
You know that means there's gonna be a shakeup in the Idea Department too.
Why is Lucifer so doggone bent on getting that Little Joe?
Pappy's gotta make a test case out of this one.
He won't let the Lord get away with breaking the rules...
...by giving Little Joe another chance.
If the Lord gets pigheaded about this case...
...I don't know how we gonna win out.
We never has yet.
Boys, we's got to pull something big.
We's got to get a colossal idea.
Like the time we got
King Pharaoh of Egypt...
...to force the children of Israel to make bricks without straw.
- Do y'all remember that one?
- Do I remember that one?
- Wasn't I the one who thunk it up?
- That's right, you was.
- Wasn't the Lord burned up about that one?
- He was that.
I didn't do so bad myself.
I was the one that thought up...
...flies.
- And you ain't had an idea like that since.
You's going stale. All of you.
Ideas like them only come once in a million years, Junior.
One of you better get an idea quick.
Or you all gonna be out there in your old jobs...
...heaving coal in the boiler room.
It's gonna be kind of tough on you boys...
...after this nice, cool, air-conditioned office.
Now, that's gratitude for you.
That's gratitude for you.
After all the wickedness we done promoted for the big boss...
...ever since Eve got Adam to nibble on that apple.
There's a great idea.
Who thought that one up?
Oh, I know you did. Don't tell me.
- Man, that's how I started my career.
- Yeah.
And here we are watching it finish.
If I could just get that psalm-singing Petunia out of the way.
Doggone it, she's in my horns at every turn.
Hey, chief.
How about setting Petunia up in a love nest with a rich racketeer...
...and then getting the joint raided?
- That is the most awful idea!
- I'm sorry.
The whole trouble is, I's stuck with a bunch of B idea men.
All the A boys is over there in Europe.
Say...
...how about?
- No.
- No?
Let me see, now.
I've got it!
I've got something terrifical.
Listen to this. Why can't we flood
Little Joe with money?
Barrels of money.
Make him rich and watch him come down here quicker than that.
- I don't know.
- It's awful good.
Think of all the success we've had with rich souls up there.
Give a man money, watch him act funny.
It ain't bad, Junior.
Now, how you figure you're gonna make Little Joe so rich?
- How about a sweepstake ticket?
- Well, ain't that a little corny?
Oh, no, man.
Ain't Little Joe always buying chances on some kind of ticket that don't pay off?
Yeah. I just remembered, he's got one right now.
Well, all right.
If Lucifer can fix it for that ticket to pay off...
...then we'll call in a girl that we know is gonna help us.
- Miss Georgia Brown.
- The same.
We as good as got Little Joe on the broiler right now.
- Sounds better than the apple gag to me.
- Oh, I guarantees it personally.
Boys, maybe we's in again.
Wait a minute. I'm gonna pull this one on the big boss.
- Get me Lucifer Sr.
- Just a minute.
I just got an idea.
How about taking Little Joe and making him rich?
Boy, where have you been?
Hello.
Hello, Pappy.
I think we just cracked that Little Joe case.
Oh, yes, sir. I just thought up an idea that's a natural.
Came to me just like that.
Can you fix it so Little Joe can cash in big on his sweepstake ticket?
You can?
Then he's just as good as in the bag already.
That's right. We make him rich...
...and with the cooperation of one of your favorite daughters...
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, that's the one.
Then all we does is just sit back and watches the fun.
Okay, then, Pappy.
You just tend to that ticket and leave the rest to me.
Oh, yes, sir. Thank you, Pappy.
How's Mammy?
So you still in the doghouse, huh?
Well, so long, Pappy.
Boys, he's crazy about it.
Now, all we's got to do is to sell Georgia Brown the idea.
She'll know what to do with that Little Joe.
My, my.
You sure are a pretty thing, Georgia.
Yes, sir, you certainly are a sight for the eyes.
Now, just look at yourself.
There's no doubts about it.
You just about the prettiest girl in town.
That's enough. Get going.
Oh, it's such a beautiful day.
Mostly anything could happen to a girl on a pretty day like this.
Wearing her best dress, her best perfume.
Your best perfume.
I wonder what Little Joe's doing right now.
He never could resist you.
And you kind of like him too, don't you?
Yes, sir. That little man certainly had something.
Wouldn't do no harm to sort of...
...mosey over and see how he's doing, huh?
Go on.
Just mosey.
Hey, hey! Hey, be careful.
Where you want this put, Mr. Jackson?
Just take it around to the rear entrance to my residence.
I guess he means the back porch.
- Petunia?
- Right here, honey.
- What you doing?
- Trying to keep your lunch warm.
- You're a little late today.
- I had to stop off at a couple of places.
Joe, you're up to something.
What you hiding behind your back?
A little gift for you.
Oh, Little Joe, you shouldn't.
And ain't they pretty.
Not pretty enough for you, Petunia.
There ain't no flowers pretty enough for my Petunia's birthday.
Birthday. Oh, Joe, this is the first time you've remembered my birthday in years.
Oh, it ain't nothing. I'm aiming to remember all of them from now on.
- What's on the ice?
- Oh, a nice cold pitcher of lemonade.
Oh, yes.
Just what the doctor ordered.
Look at you.
Standing all covered with God's good dirt and all the devilishness sweated out you.
My, but you a handsome sight.
Look at them muscles.
Ain't they killing?
- About to pop out of my sleeve.
- I bet you the strongest man on that job.
Oh, I toss them sacks around like they was full of nothing.
Why, the boss say if I don't slow down he's gonna have to unemploy a couple of men.
Joe, just what on earth are you doing?
Now comes the grand surprise.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Have some refreshments on the house, boys.
What'll you have for a chaser?
How you like it?
Now all we need is some electricity so we can run it.
Come on.
Oh, honey.
Not on your birthday.
There ain't nobody got no right being happy as I am.
Well, come on. Smile, then.
Come on. That's it.
Now, you wanna do something to make me happy?
Sing us a little song.
- Oh, come on, Miss Jackson.
- Sure.
- The one you sang the first time we...
- Joe.
Oh, you know the one I mean.
Petunia!
Six o'clock already.
How come you so spry, Little Joe?
Oh, you can't wear out a man filled with the spirit of the Lord.
Which one of y'all is Little Joe Jackson?
- What do you want with him?
- Is you him?
Maybe I am. That all depends on who you are.
Well, I got a cablegram for him.
What's a cablegram?
- Something good?
- Well, sometimes it's good...
...and sometimes it's bad.
Well, how about this one?
Is it good or bad?
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
- Well, in that case, I don't want none.
- Oh, so you is Little Joe Jackson.
- You got to receive it.
- What do you mean, I got to receive it?
- This is a free country, ain't it?
- This is special for you.
There's your name right on it.
See there?
Looks like just a ordinary letter to me.
It is, except that it come from under the ocean.
Just sign right there.
Is this gonna cost me something?
We usually gets a little something for our services.
Of course, that's up to you.
Well, that's settled.
What you doing? Voting?
That's my signature when my secretary ain't around.
I'm a very busy man.
Clear out of here, will you?
Maybe I'd better read it to you, huh?
You trying to tell me I can't read?
Now, go on, beat it, while I look over my correspondence.
Okay. I was just trying to be helpful.
What in the world is all this about anyhow?
So that's it.
That's what you've been cooking up in your fire, you smoke-eating mole.
I told Pappy this was gonna take you by surprise.
What do you mean by fixing it for him to win the sweepstake?
- You're not gonna get away with this.
- This'll buy him a ticket to the boiler room.
This is the dirtiest double-cross since Lucifer's been in business.
Why, thank you, general.
You're rather flattering today.
Can't make heads or tails out of this thing.
- Must be an ad, I guess.
- Joseph.
That paper might lead you into temptation.
- Throw it away.
- No, no, don't you do it.
You wouldn't want Petunia to know about it.
Don't believe him.
Petunia would love to know about it.
- Throw it away!
- Hang on to it!
Maybe you'd better step in, Lord.
- Still here, Joe?
- I was just going.
- Going to the picture show?
- No. Me and Petunia's going...
...to a prayer meeting.
- Okay, deacon.
- I'll walk down with you.
- Okay.
Good evening, Junior.
- Does Little Joe Jackson work here?
- You just missed him, lady.
He went home.
Oh, my!
I guess we'll use the frying pan after all.
Petunia!
Honey! Petunia!
Oh, Petunia?
Where are you, Petunia?
Oh, Lily? Where'd Petunia go?
She said she's going to the store to get you some clothes.
Oh, yeah.
Doggone, I ought to fix that roof.
That would be a fine thing to do, Little Joe.
The main idea is to keep busy, you know.
Oh, I'm too tired.
I'll fix it in the morning.
General, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Just take a look over yonder.
Hello, Little Joe.
This is bad business.
Georgia Brown.
Wha..? What are you doing here?
I just wanted to say hello and see how you been.
Ain't no harm in that.
Is there?
Well, there ain't no harm in passing the time of day. I guess.
It's nice to know you're getting well again.
I hope you ain't forgot me.
Oh, I ain't forgot you.
Then maybe you'll be coming round to Jim Henry's place to see me.
- I tell you, Georgia, it's like this.
- Yeah?
It's like this.
It seems the last time I was there,
I got into a little bit of trouble.
Oh, that. Oh, the guy that caused all that trouble...
...that Domino Johnson, he's in jail now.
I know, but that ain't it.
Well, what is it, then?
Look at me, Little Joe.
Is you happy without seeing me?
- Well, the truth is...
- of course you're happy.
Tell her to get away from here before you spoil all your chances.
Tell the truth, I has been trying my best not to think of you lately.
You has, sugar?
Why, you lying rascal. You know you never could get her out of your mind.
Go ahead and tell her that.
Of course, I ain't saying
I altogether forgot you.
You ain't easy to erase from the mind...
...once a man gets to know you good-like.
Why does you want to forget me, sugar?
Well, it seems there was a lot of reasons why...
...but for the life of me, I can't seem to think of one of them now.
Of course, if you don't care about me no more.
Georgia, don't talk like that.
Why, you know I'd never do anything to hurt your feelings.
Oh, honey.
- And there goes his passport to heaven.
- Get her out of here.
Oh, this is the best fight we've won in a long time.
Go ahead, Little Joe.
Kick over the traces.
Now, stop that, Little Joe.
Think of the consequences.
Little Joe, cut that out!
Georgia, this has got to stop.
Little Joe, you ain't fooling me none with that there religion stuff.
I know you better than that.
You're just playing hard to get.
And I know why too.
- What are you talking about?
- This. This is what I'm talking about.
- You dropped it down at the mill.
- Oh, that's just a little old ad.
An ad? Did you read it?
You gonna be filthy with money.
- How filthy?
- Why, you big ignoramus...
...this here piece of paper says you've drawn the horse in the Irish Sweepstake.
- Say that again, slower.
- Listen to this:
"Mr. Joe Jackson.
Dear sir, we are happy to learn...
...that you drew the horse Runaway in the forthcoming Irish Sweepstakes...
...and that he is the favorite to win.
We hereby offer you a sum equal to $50,000 for your interest in..."
I'm gonna be rich!
I don't know whether
I'm dreaming or not.
I'm gonna be rich.
This must be the payoff.
This must be my reward for being a good husband.
Petunia was right. The Lord is wonderful! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
No, no! That's not the way it's supposed to work out.
Wait till Petunia hears this. Hallelujah!
Not quite the way you planned it, eh?
What are you gonna do with all that money, Little Joe?
Buy Petunia all the things she's never had.
Wait till she gets here.
But, Georgia, I wouldn't have known about this if it hadn't been for you.
I'm gonna show you how grateful I am.
I'm gonna buy you a diamond bracelet and a fur coat...
...maybe even your own nightclub too.
- It's all right, Petunia.
- Oh, Little Joe...
...I love you so much more now than I ever did.
This is the most wonderful thing that's ever happened to me.
Little Joe!
Petunia.
You double-crossing snake.
Sneaking that woman in my house the minute my back is turned.
- But, Petunia, you're all wrong. Listen...
- Listen for what?
Ain't I seen and heard enough already?
You gonna buy her a bracelet with the money you earned.
What's the matter? You gone out your mind? You gone crazy?
Yes, I'm going crazy.
And if I stand here looking at you another minute, I'll kill you both!
Listen, let me explain something.
Joe, for the last time, get out of my sight!
Oh, no.
Petunia.
You didn't even give him a chance.
Lord...
...why you let me love him so much...
...so he can hurt me so bad?
Why?
Hey!
Look who's present.
Knock me down if it ain't Domino Johnson.
- When'd you get out?
- Tonight.
- Only had six months' lease on that cell.
- Welcome home.
- Glad to be with you.
- Hey, big boy.
- Hi, y'all, babes.
- Domino!
- Easy, honey, easy.
- Hello, Domino.
- Hello there, Jim Henry.
- Hi, Domino.
- Hi, Dude!
- Nobody I'd rather see than you.
- Come on, have a little drink.
- Thanks. My, my.
Things sure look prosperous.
Last time, one of the characters tried to operate...
...with a pair of imperfect dice, remember?
I don't think Little Joe knew they were loaded.
- Well, he found out.
- What'll it be, Domino?
- A little rye.
- It's on the house. A little rye.
Duke Ellington's band.
Where'd all this prosperity come from?
As a matter of fact, most of the bankroll came from Little Joe.
Yeah, he's just loaded down with money.
He give me this 20 just for shining his shoes.
You better keep him away from me.
- You don't intend to start trouble with him.
- That's up to him.
As a matter of fact,
I'm here entirely for social purposes.
Suppose you tell Miss Georgia Brown that her old friend...
...Domino Johnson is back in circulation.
- I'm not sure she'll be in this evening.
- Still working here, ain't she?
Yeah, when she feels like it.
If she gets in at all, it won't be till late.
Then I'll stick around.
Got a game going upstairs?
- Yeah, a little stud poker.
- Well, I'll stroll up and take a few hands.
But don't forget to let me know when Georgia gets here.
We certainly won't.
If he sees her with Little Joe...
This time I ain't gonna use the door,
I'm going out the window.
- Well, look who's here!
- Domino!
Welcome home, baby.
- You gonna do any shooting tonight?
- Yes, sugar, but only with dice.
- My, you do look sharp tonight.
- Yeah?
Quiet. Which one of you kids is gonna mind my tires tonight?
I am!
Well, I guess I better let you all do it.
Here's a little change for you.
Catch it. Come on.
You better pick us up about 4 in the morning.
Very good, sir, and hot dog.
May I, Madame?
Great day!
Joe, that's the bestest-looking raiment...
...since they first invented clothes.
My, my, look at that jewelry.
It ain't nothing at all.
Wait till you see what
I spring on you next Saturday.
Now, if you'll all just step over to the bar and be my guests.
Georgia, that dress will be ahead of fashion...
...a hundred years from today.
- Yeah, yeah.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
The accessories are even cuter.
Georgia. Georgia.
- Remember, you're a lady now.
- I know it, sugar.
I'm just trying to impress them with that fact.
Hey.
You wanna see something swell?
Lookie there. Genuine silk.
I got a dozen of them.
Dude!
Tell the band to play Georgia's number.
Domino!
Hello, Little Joe.
How you doing these days?
I'm still alive and kicking, but that ain't no fault of yours.
Still cheating the boys with those one-way dice of yours?
Cut that stuff out.
Georgia, what are you doing hanging around with small fry like that?
Better than hanging around with a gambler like you.
- I won't take that from you.
- Look out, he'll go after you again.
That's all right. Let him.
- Only this time, I ain't running, see?
- Come on, boys. Break it up.
This is a social gathering.
You trying to get back in that jail?
Good evening, riffraff.
Hello, Jim Henry.
Thought I'd just drop round...
...and give your joint the once-over.
Why, Petunia.
- Is this really you?
- But not the same me...
...you used to break her back busting suds over a tub for you.
Why, you...
You're beautiful, Petunia.
Save that sugarcoated talk for your girlfriend.
Where'd you get the clothes?
Don't you worry about that.
The main point is you paying for them.
Of course. Of course I'll pay for them.
I didn't realize...
And that ain't all I'm collecting before I'm through.
Don't talk like that, Petunia.
You know I still love you.
Now, you just be a little more careful...
...what you say to your wife in front of me.
Georgia, you keep out of this.
- I'm speaking my mind.
- And I ain't heard a sound.
Little Joe, are you so dumb you can't see what she's after?
We're both after the same thing, but
I'm still the wife and got the inside track.
Petunia, don't talk like that.
Why, I was coming around to see...
Don't strain yourself.
I'm sending my lawyer round to see you...
...and he'd better find you in.
- What for?
- Money. What you think?
And if you ain't saved my half, brother, start sprouting wings.
- What's wings?
- That's one way of getting out of jail.
I know all about that sweepstake money...
...and I'm solid collecting my half, cash on the line.
Well, I don't know if I got that much left, Petunia.
No? Then you're just in the correct suit to be laid out in.
I'll shoot you for a drink, Jim Henry, with your own dice again.
No. Might as well give you the drink and pass up the formalities.
What'll it be, Miss Jackson?
- You may give me a double King Kong.
- Boy. Coming up.
Petunia.
Pardon me, but ain't you the gentleman that used my ex-husband...
...for target practice six months ago?
Yes, I had that pleasure.
Then permit me to buy you a drink for that good deed.
Oh, no, ma'am. The drinks is on me.
You know, Mr. Johnson,
I usually don't drink with strangers...
...but we have so much in common.
We both dislike the same people.
Brown! Ain't it about time for you to get into that cooch dance?
Ladies. Georgia, remember, when you in the presence of a lady...
...you got to act like one.
- I guess she's just jealous...
...because she ain't got what I got.
Quit kidding yourself.
Not only have I got everything you got...
...but a whole lot more.
- Well, you ain't got Little Joe.
And that's the main thing you got I don't want.
And if I run across any more secondhand junk...
...I'll pass that on to you.
- Petunia, you can't act like this.
- Oh, can't I?
Why, Jim Henry, I see you've worked yourself up with an orchestra.
- Yeah.
- Ask the boys to put me in the mood...
...so I can give out.
- With pleasure, Mrs. Jackson.
I suddenly feel a musical urge.
Mrs. Jackson, to your musical urge.
- Give up, general?
- Certainly not.
Well, you might as well.
You haven't forgotten that Little Joe's six-months' trial period is up tonight?
In fact, I think he has just 10 minutes left.
That's a lot of time when we're on the job.
And it looks like he's not coming down there alone.
Why, it looks like he's gonna bring
Petunia right on down there with him.
Little Joe!
Little Joe!
Look out!
- Hey there, what you think you're..?
- Get out.
Lord, do something about this.
Hear my prayer.
Send down your wrath and destroy this wicked place.
No, don't!
Little Joe, don't! He'll shoot you!
No! Little Joe! It's Little Joe!
Little Joe.
Little Joe?
This feels familiar.
Oh, me. I'm in for it again.
Little Joe, you got a funny feeling?
I got a feeling, but it ain't funny.
You know, I don't feel no pain now.
Of course you don't.
You're a ghost now, Petunia.
A ghost? You mean we're both dead?
We got killed in that ruckus.
I'm scared of what'll happen in the next couple of minutes.
How do you know what's gonna happen in the next couple of minutes?
Oh, Lord, I know I ain't got no right asking for forgiveness.
But I was doing all right until I had that falling out with Petunia.
Little Joe, you didn't throw me over for Georgia Brown, did you?
Excuse me just a moment, Lord.
How come you understand all that now?
Oh, I see it plain now.
Georgia Brown come around trying...
...to take you from me, but you resisted her.
Ain't this a fine time to be getting some sense.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. But then,
I was only human. I didn't understand.
I wonder if the general's gonna see it that way.
General? What on earth you talking about now?
I ain't talking about nothing on earth.
I just hope he gets here before
Lucifer Jr. Comes busting in on us.
- Lucifer Jr.? Who's he?
- I ain't got time to explain that now.
General? You coming, general?
- General!
- Little Joe. Stop that shouting.
Yes, sir, general. Yes, sir.
Petunia, we've just balanced the books on you...
...and find you're eligible to enter the Pearly Gates.
We're discounting this little setback tonight because we know...
...you were just acting up to get Little Joe back.
Oh, thank you, sir. Little Joe coming along with me too, ain't he?
No, I'm afraid not.
Oh, me.
Little Joe, we've just finished your ledger.
- I'm afraid you're in the red again.
- I am?
Yes. Our records show that Georgia Brown...
...got about half the sweepstake money.
The other half was spent at Jim Henry's and other places like that.
You mean, you kept track of how he spent that money?
Yes, it's all down here.
I'm a dead pigeon.
Little Joe, you've heard the final report.
Your account is closed up.
But we've opened...
...a brand-new account for you, you rascal.
Little Joe, come along to Papa.
And what if I refuses to budge off this here spot?
Oh, we likes it when souls needs a little prodding.
- Give me my pitchfork.
- I was only asking, that's all.
- Come on, let's get going.
- No, wait.
- Pappy...
- Junior, sir. Pappy wants to see you.
Georgia Brown has just give herself to the Lord.
Georgia Brown? Why, that's impossible.
Why, she's the best sinner we've got.
She was, but she just repented all of her sins...
...and, boy, there sure was a mess of them.
We can't afford to lose her.
Georgia's first act of atonement was to hand over...
...all of her worldly belongings to the church.
The church?
That's bad.
Pappy's gonna burn about this.
You know, that's just what Pappy said about you.
He also told me to take charge of the Little Joe case.
In fact, you is demoted.
Demoted?
Why, Pappy can't do this to me.
Why, I put the... oh, Pappy!
So long, Junior.
They come and they go.
Yeah, they come and they go.
Georgia Brown atoning?
- Why, this is a great day for us.
- Just a minute, general.
Don't Little Joe get credit in the heavenly ledger for all that money she took from him?
I must. Let's see.
A fur coat and a diamond bracelet...
According to my figures, that just puts me under the wire by a nose.
In fact, I'm 2 cents to the good.
Well, it was a tight squeeze, but I made it.
Little Joe. You ought to know you can't bargain with the Lord.
You're attempting to take advantage of a technicality.
- I am?
- For shame, Little Joe.
Are you trying to rouse the ire of the Lord?
The voice of the Lord.
Yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord. That's about the way things stand, Lord.
Yes, Lord.
Come, Petunia.
The golden chariot's waiting for you.
No.
Oh, Lord, please be patient and listen to me again.
I'm not asking you to take Little Joe to heaven if he don't belong there.
And, Lord, getting to heaven has been the main thought in my life.
But somehow it never crossed my mind
I'd be going there without Little Joe.
And as I am to blame for all this,
I can't leave him.
I just can't leave him, Lord.
- Long climb, ain't it?
- It ain't much farther.
I'm feeling kind of funny.
You think I can make it?
Sure, you can make it.
Yes, you can make it.
I'm getting kind of weary.
- Can I make it?
- Yes, you can make it.
Do you think I can make it?
Petunia.
Can I make it?
Can I make it, Petunia?
Can I make it?
Petunia.
Are you all right, Petunia? Petunia.
- Petunia. Are you all right?
- Of course.
They didn't get you.
Doctor, do something.
- Lay him down.
- Lay down, dear. Quiet.
Do something.
Why, the fever's way down.
He's going to be all right.
All he needs now is plenty of rest.
And he's likely to be hungry pretty soon.
Oh, I'll take care of that.
Don't you worry about him, now, and I'll call in again later on.
And you'd better get some rest yourself.
Oh, I don't need any rest.
I got new strength now.
What's the matter, darling? You in pain?
No, I just remembered something.
Kind of a dream I had, I guess.
Oh, Petunia.
- Oh, Petunia.
- Now, Joe.
Petunia, get me that sweepstake ticket.
And them dice too.
They're on the bureau.
Now burn them.
Burn them up, right away.
All right, darling.
Put these in the stove, Lily.
Joe, what made you think of that right now?
Petunia, you was right.
You was right about me gambling and the bad company I was keeping.
I almost didn't get into heaven on account of it.
Get into heaven?
What are you talking about, Joe?
I had a narrow escape, I'll tell you that.
- And if it hadn't been for you, Petunia...
- oh, well, let's not talk about that now.
Let's talk about how happy you've made me now that you've come back.

SON OF DRACULA
- How are ya, Doctor?
- Hello, Harry.
Hey, Charlie.
Hello, Dr. Brewster,
Mr. Stanley.
How are ya?
Say, are those all the passengers you had?
Just the four.
You didn't put anybody off at the wrong station, did you?
We're here to meet a friend of the Caldwells, a Count Alucard.
There was no count on this train.
All customers.
Say, there was a lot of stuff in the baggage car that might belong to your count.
Thanks.
We'll take a look at it.
[Man]
All aboard!
Well, does this look as though he's come to stay for just a couple of weeks?
No, it doesn't. I wonder what's become of him.
Probably coming by car.
Don't worry. He'll show up.
- "D-R-A-C..."
- What are you mumbling about?
Nothing, nothing.
Just a silly idea hit me.
Well, if there's no Alucard, there's no need of our waiting around here.
I've got to get back to the office.
- Is that you, Matthew?
- Yes, ma'am, Miss Kay. This is Matthew.
I brought the trunks and boxes, but Mr. Frank... said the count didn't come on the train.
Oh. Well, put them in the guest house as I told you.
Yes, ma'am, but I have to have some help.
They're amazingly heavy.
Then get some of the other boys to help you.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Come on, Sam.
Come on.
Matthew's back from town.
Oh, did the count come?
No, not yet.
If you only had a phone,
Frank would have called after the train arrived.
Believe me, if I still lived here, I'd have one, even if I had to string the wires myself.
There are other means of communication.
Oh, please, Kay.
No lectures on metaphysics tonight, huh?
You should allow your mind to explore the unknown, Claire, then you wouldn't laugh at telepathy.
I know Count Alucard will be here tonight, without benefit of telephone.
Oh, he probably missed the train and will come down tomorrow.
I must run in and see Dad for a minute before I dress for the party.
See you later, huh?
[Frogs Croaking,
Birds Squawking]
[Mumbled Chanting]
[Mumbled Chanting
Continues]
[Squawking]
You do not know why you came here tonight.
It was because
I wished you here.
W-Well, why?
Isn't Count Alucard...
I wished you here to warn you.
The angel of death hovers over a great house.
I see it in ruins... weeds, vines growing over it, bats flying in and out the broken windows.
But I want to know of Count Alucard.
Is he coming?
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me, Queen Zimba?
Alucard is not his name.
You must stop him before it is too late.
Stop him before death comes to Dark Oaks.
Tell me if he is coming tonight.
I see you... marrying a corpse, living in a grave.
I see...

Queen Zimba!

** [Waltz]
Uh, Steven!
This excitement over Kay's count has worn me out.
If you'll all excuse me,
I'll let Steven take me upstairs.
[All Murmur] Good night, Colonel.
Good night.
- He's holding up very well.
- Good night.
[Woman] Good night, Colonel.
Well, Father,
I'm afraid we'll have to do this all over again when Count Alucard does come.
I'm afraid so.
I hope you're not too tired, Father.
No, I feel fine.
Now, you run along and dance.
- Steven'll help me upstairs.
Good night, children. - Good night then.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Colonel.
Good night.
I'll smoke a cigar before going to bed.
- That'll be all for now, Steven.
- Yes, sir.
Kay, you're worried about something.
I wish you'd tell me what it is.
Wouldn't you be upset if you gave a reception... and your guest of honor didn't appear?
- Is that all?
- Isn't that enough?
Yes, I suppose it is, but I rather thought you might be worrying... about that old Hungarian gypsy you brought back with you.
I understand she died tonight.
- Queen Zimba?
- "Queen"?
That old swamp cat with a cabin full of dried lizards and stuffed toads?
It's good riddance, if you ask me.
How did you know she was dead?
That sort of news travels fast.
One of the farm hands told me.
He also said you were there when she died.
- I'd hoped no one knew that.
- Why?
She died of a heart attack.
Certainly your being there could have no bearing on it.
Oh, they'll ask questions...
What was I doing there, and what brought on the attack?
And if I told them, no one around here would believe it.
Oh, what do they know of these occult matters?
Blind fools.
Kay, I think it's about time
I talked to you frankly.
We're not blind, and we're not fools.
We're just plain, sensible people... that refuse to be fooled by a lot of supernatural nonsense.
- "Nonsense"?
- Exactly.
There's no magic in dried lizards and dead chickens.
Ever since you met this Count Alucard in Budapest, you've changed.
I hardly know you.
Kay, let me take you away from all this morbid business.
A six-month's honeymoon... a year, if you like.
We won't come back here until you've overcome some of these strange ideas.
- I'm sorry.
- "Sorry"?
Does that mean you're breaking our engagement?
Oh, no. You mustn't even think that.
Then what is it, Kay?
There must be some reason.
Of course there's a reason.
Since we were kids, there's never been anyone in my heart but you. You know that.
But, well...
Don't ever doubt me, Frank, no matter what happens.
Believe in me.
Believe that what I'm doing is best for us both.
Has it anything to do with Alucard?
[Sighs]
I see.
I'm afraid there's something
I must tell you, Kay.
Alucard is an impostor, a fake.
- How can you say such a thing?
- I wrote to Senator Manfield.
His reply informed me that Count Alucard is not known at the Hungarian embassy.
[Scoffs] You must be very proud of that bit of snooping.
I only did what any man would do to protect the girl he intends to marry.
[Guests Chattering]
Miss Kay!
**[Continues]
Dr. Brewster, is there anything I can do?
No, no. You stay here.
Keep the party moving.
Father!
Get some water!
Looks like the colonel fell asleep and dropped his cigar.
That's what started the fire.
Yeah, that's probably what happened.
There's no evidence of asphyxiation.
His heart might have stopped beating before the fire.
He might even have died in his sleep.
He looks as though he were literally frightened to death.
It's purely a reflex of the facial muscles.
Doctor, what are those two marks on the throat?
They don't look like burns.
[Sobbing]
Come, Claire.
I think you'd better go.
[Guests Chattering
Quietly]
[Car Engine Revs]
[Knocking]
Announce Count Alucard.
Explain that I came by motor and was delayed.
I'm sorry, sir, but
Colonel Caldwell died tonight, and the family isn't receiving.
- Announce me!
- Yes, sir.
Central,
I called Professor Lazlo at Muirfield...
University about a half an hour ago.
Will you please check the call for me?
This is Dr. Harry Brewster,
228. Thank you.
[Ringing]
Hello?
Yes, this is
Harry Brewster speaking.
[Chuckles]
Fine, thank you.
Why, I called to find out if you know anything about... a titled Hungarian family named Alucard...
A-L-U-C-A-R-D.
Alucard? No.
I'm sure there is no such family.
The name is not Hungarian.
Well, can you tell me, is it possible there's a Count Dracula still living?
Dracula?
I'm sure there is not.
History says the last Count Dracula died in the Middle Ages. Why do you ask?
A certain Count Alucard is visiting a friend of mine.
I happened to notice that the name spelled backward is Dracula.
[Chuckling]
It made me curious.
That is strange.
According to the legends of my people, the last Count Dracula became one of the undead... a vampire... and was finally destroyed in the 19th century.
[Chuckles] I am considered somewhat of an authority on the subject.
I know, Professor.
That's why I called you.
If this man is an impostor, why should he assume that name over all others?
Oh, he wouldn't... not if he were sane.
In Transylvania, the name is associated only with evil.
I advise you to be very careful of that man.
From your tone, I gather you don't entirely disbelieve the legends of the former Dracula.
In my research, I have uncovered data which I cannot entirely disprove.
I do not say I believe, but, in honesty,
I cannot say I disbelieve.
I repeat, be very, very careful of that man.
I will, Professor.
Thank you very much.
Good-bye, sir.
You will find this will a comparatively simple document, owing chiefly to the fact that you two girls are the only living kin of Colonel Caldwell.
It divides the entire estate... cash, securities and all... evenly between...
Pardon me, Judge Simmons.
May I ask the date of that will?
August 24. It was made on the occasion of Miss Claire's attaining legal age.
Then there's a will of a later date.
There's no important difference between them, Claire.
There's a mighty important difference for you, Kay.
According to this, you get nothing but the plantation.
Claire gets all cash and securities.
It's properly witnessed and can't be disputed, but I can't imagine what your father was thinking of.
It's the way I wanted it.
To divide the estate otherwise would have meant selling the plantation.
I love Dark Oaks, and hope to live here... always.
But, my dear child, it takes real capital to operate a plantation of this size.
I wouldn't worry about that, Judge.
I think Colonel Caldwell knew what he was doing.
Oh. Oh, I see.
Well, I'd, uh... I'd offer my congratulations, but this hardly seems the proper time.
That seems to end the matter.
I'll start the legal machinery in motion at once.
In fact, I'll start it today, if the clerk's office is still open.
Good-bye.
Oh, don't bother, Claire.
- I'll find my way out, thank you.
- Good-bye, Judge.
I can't understand how you've been able to get along without servants.
I take it that none of them have returned since that night.
No, but I'll arrange for others if I find I need them.
Well, of course, you know what you want to do.
Come along, Claire.
Let's leave these two alone for a while.
I'll see you again before I leave.
I'm so terribly sorry for Frank.
I'm afraid he's living in a fool's paradise.
A fool's paradise?
Yes, I'm certain Kay doesn't intend to marry him.
Well, what's the trouble...
- Count Alucard?
- Oh, she couldn't marry him.
There's something, well, repulsive about him.
The way he came in the night Father died, and...
Oh, I don't know.
I understand he left almost immediately.
At least that was decent of him.
Yes, but...
I'm positive Kay's been seeing him more or less secretly.
Why do you say that?
A couple of nights ago,
I heard them talking in the hall downstairs.
Somehow, I didn't like the idea, and I went to the head of the stairs to make sure.
- And?
- Kay was alone in the lower hall, but she was looking up at me as if... well, as if she'd been caught at something she wasn't very proud of.
I see.
Did you mention it to her?
Yes, but she pooh-poohed the idea, said I was dreaming.
I let it go at that, but I wasn't dreaming.
I hadn't been asleep.
Hmm.
That does sound strange.
Have you been in the guest house since the night your father died?
No, but surely you don't think Count Alucard...
I don't know what to think!
He couldn't be living in town without my knowing it.
I'd like to take a look at his belongings, if he hasn't taken them away.
He couldn't have done that alone... they were too heavy.
This might be a very good time.
Two large chests as well as the trunks came on the train.
I don't know what's become of them.
They were put in here.
That's strange.
They're not in there either.
Well, it may not be ethical, but there are reasons we ought to find out more about the count.
He didn't have any handbags.
I don't like it, Claire.
He can't be traveling around with only the clothes he's wearing.
See what I meant about Frank and Kay?
I don't like it, Claire.
I don't like it one bit!
You've got to leave here and go back to town, and the sooner the better.
You sound as if I was in some kind of danger.
I'd rather not go into that, but I insist upon your leaving.
You can go in with me and send for your things later.
Well, I can't leave Kay alone.
If I'm in danger, she must be too.
I'm going to make one last attempt to persuade her to leave.
If she won't...
Well, if she won't,
I want you to join me in swearing out... an insanity complaint against her.
An insanity complaint?
Are you serious?
Kay's my sister!
Claire, everybody's in danger here,
Kay more than anyone else.
If she won't leave voluntarily, we've just got to force her.
Yes, but-but she'd be arrested, put in an asylum!
I'd never do that to her.
Claire, don't you see?
We've got to protect Kay from herself.
Yes, what is it?
You remember me, don't you, Mr. Kirby?
Yes, of course. You're
Colonel Caldwell's daughter.
- Sorry to hear about your father.
- Thank you.
May we come in?
We want to be married. Married?
Yes, of course.
Come right in.
Ma! Cecilia!
In a few moments, my dear, you will become Countess Alucard.
[Wind Whistling Fiercely]
[Thunder Rumbling]
Everything has worked out as we planned.
This house is ours.
No one else has any claim on it.
I like old houses, and I like your countryside and the swampland.
- It's very different from your homeland.
- That is why I like it.
My land is dry and desolate.
The soil is red with the blood of a hundred races.
There is no life left there.
Here you have a young and vital race.
You've spoken of your people, but I want to know more... their legends, their mystery, their gifts.
Perhaps someday we may return there.
As I have told you, my dear, ours will be a different life, without material needs... a life that will last through eternity.
[Knocking]
[Sighs]
I'll see who it is.
[Knocking Continues]
I told you not to come here again, Frank.
I'm sorry.
Please, Kay.
I've got to talk to you.
Kay, I must know what this is all about.
I know that you and Alucard are meeting secretly.
I followed you tonight.
I don't know where you went because I lost you, but...
We went to Mr. Kirby's.
We were married.
Married? No.
No, you couldn't have!
I told you before, we were married tonight.
You'll save us all a lot of unpleasantness by going back to town with me tonight... and taking the first train out in the morning!
I'm afraid
I do not understand.
Then I'll make it clear.
You're going back to town with me tonight.
In the morning you'll take the first train out.
Kay will have the marriage annulled, and if you try to stop her... or show up in this part of the country again, you'll be jailed!
Kay!
[Squeaking]
[Labored Knocking]
Frank!
My boy!
Harry...
Harry, how did I get here?
Did you bring me here from Dark Oaks?
No, you came alone, about a couple of minutes ago.
What's happened, Frank?
Harry. Harry!
Harry, I've killed Kay!
It's all mixed up, but I know I shot her twice.
Harry, am I insane?
Could I have shot through Alucard and killed her without hurting him?
Tell me what happened.
Well, l... I shot right through him.
I shot right through him!
Kay screamed and fell, and he just stood there... just stood there, staring at me... just staring at me!
- You don't believe that, do you?
Nobody will. - Yes, I believe you.
- Have you got your revolver?
- I dropped it in the drive.
But you haven't told me just what happened.
Kay and Alucard were married.
- I know. I followed them.
- Well, didn't you try to stop the wedding?
A tree smashed my car, and I lost them.
Then I went back to Dark Oaks, and I found them there and got in a fight with him.
He got me by the throat.
It was like one of those crazy nightmares... where you can't move or struggle or...
I had no more strength against him than a baby.
He just threw me aside.
Then I fired.
The bullets went through him without even hurting him, and...
- and killed Kay.
- What did you do then?
I don't know!
I just seemed to be running and falling and...
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know anything except I found myself here.
I don't even know if it's real!
Maybe it's a nightmare or something!
Shh. Just rest yourself for a while, Frank.
We'll find out just how much of it happened.
Here. Drink this.
Lie down, Frank.
[Hinges Creaking]
[Clucking]
May I inquire... what you are doing here?
I was about to ask you the same question.
Tonight Miss Caldwell and I were married.
I am now master of this house.
You see, you owe me an explanation.
I came here to see Katherine.
The door was open, she didn't answer my call, and I thought I heard somebody here in the cellar.
I, too, thought that I heard someone in the cellar.
Come.
Dr. Brewster, what on earth brings you here this time of night?
I hope nothing's happened to Claire.
No. No, she was worried that something had happened to you.
I'm sorry.
Count Alucard and I were married tonight.
Yes, so the count told me.
It was the way we wanted it... quiet and alone.
That's the way we're going to live, Doctor.
You see, I'm engaged in some scientific research.
It will take up all of our daylight hours.
And we'll have no time for social life.
We want you to explain this to Claire.
And to Frank.
I'm fond of Frank, but, of course, he must never come here again.
I'd like you to tell all our friends not to come.
If Judge Simmons has papers for us to sign, tell him to bring them in the evening.
Katherine is going to assist me in my research.
I see.
Well, uh, there doesn't seem to be any more for me to say, so, if you'll pardon me,
Katherine, I'll be leaving.
Good night.
Good-bye, Doctor, and say good-bye to Frank.
Perhaps I should emphasize some of Katherine's wishes.
When I came to Dark Oaks,
I was not graciously welcomed.
Now the position has changed.
I am master.
Anyone who enters here without my permission... will be considered a trespasser.
Good morning, Sarah.
Will you set another place, please?
For Mr. Stanley... he slept on the couch in the office last night.
There's nobody in there now, sir.
There's a blanket on the couch but no sign of Mr. Frank.
Why didn't you put him in the spare bedroom?
No wonder he never stayed for breakfast.
I'll just take coffee this morning, Sarah.
[Knocking]
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, Judge.
It's Judge Simmons,
Doctor.
Give Sarah your hat and coat and have some breakfast with me.
I'll keep my coat on.
I can only stay a minute.
- Quite a rain we had.
- Yes, started about 4:00.
- Claire isn't here yet?
- No.
No, I expect her any minute though.
I was up most of the night studying that insanity complaint you got out against Katherine.
What did you decide?
Well, if I didn't know you,
I'd be suspicious of your motives.
You have no evidence of insanity, Harry.
The fact she wants to live alone at Dark Oaks may be eccentric, but that's all.
And her infatuation for this count, even if he's an impostor...
That may be bad judgment, but it couldn't be construed as insanity.
They were married last night by Kirby.
Oh.
[Phone Ringing]
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Katherine's like a niece to me.
You're wanted on the phone,
Judge Simmons.
It's Mrs. Simmons, sir.
She says it's important.
- You better take it in my office, Judge.
- Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Yes?
Yes, dear.
What?
Yes. Well, I'll go right over to the courthouse.
Good-bye.
Frank Stanley surrendered to the sheriff a while ago.
Told some story about killing Katherine.
That's not so, Judge.
I know.
He came here in a delirious condition and told me the same story.
I gave him a sedative and I drove out to Dark Oaks.
I talked to Katherine, and that was long after Frank said he killed her.
Oh, well, you'd better come to the courthouse and tell them that.
Sarah?
Professor Lazlo is arriving here from
Memphis on the morning train.
He's spending a few days here.
- Make him comfortable, will you?
- Yes, sir.
- Morning, Bob.
- Good morning.
[Man]
Come in.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Morning, Coroner.
- Morning.
Where's Frank, Sheriff?
The deputy's fetching him.
We're all going to Dark Oaks.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
Dr. Brewster says that Frank is insane.
I talked to Katherine and her husband after
Frank was supposed to have shot her.
What? Well, I'm going to Dark Oaks, anyway, and talk to them myself.
No need of going till evening.
Katherine and her husband will be away all day.
Where will they be?
I don't know, but they told me to tell Claire they wouldn't be home.
I'm gonna take Frank out anyway.
Maybe he'll come to his senses... if we make him go over the ground like in his confession.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
Frank has had a shock.
What he needs is complete relaxation.
Frank Stanley has confessed to murder.
I have to act on it.
It won't hurt him to ride out there.
- I give you my word that it will.
- That's too bad!
Money and position don't rate him any better treatment than anyone else from me.
- Did he act crazy to you, Dr. Peters?
- No, can't say that he did... a little irrational, maybe, same as anyone after committin' murder.
Hmm.
You can come along, Doc.
If everything's all right,
I'll forget all about the confession.
That ought to be all right.
Funny that they'd leave the door open.
Anyone here?
Tell us where you were when you shot Katherine, and where she and her husband were.
There's nothing to worry about.
Enact the scene just as you think it happened.
It was in the library.
I seem to remember running out there and dropping the gun in the driveway.
Are you sure you didn't drive off in your car?
No, I couldn't have.
I remember a tree fell on it earlier while
I was following Kay and Alucard.
- About what time was that?
- It's all so mixed up.
I just don't know, but I'm sure
I went out that way.
Come on, Frank.
Suppose you show us just where.
I was here, but I don't remember anything after that.
Remember this,
Frank?
I think we'd better go back to the office,
Doctor, while you do some explaining.
Kay! Kay, my darling!
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Has Professor Lazlo arrived?
Yes, sir.
He's been here all day, in and out.
Can I fix you something to eat?
The professor's had his dinner.
No, thanks.
Professor,
I'm glad to see you.
I heard about the tragic events of last night.
I called at the courthouse several times, but they wouldn't let me see you.
- Step inside.
- Thank you.
The sheriff believes I'm an accessory after the fact in the murder of Katherine.
- I can't say that I blame him.
- Why?
He can't believe that I spoke to
Katherine after Frank shot her.
Because I urged him to keep away from Dark Oaks until tonight, he thinks I intended to hide her body during the day.
- But he didn't arrest you?
- No.
No, me questioned me most of the day, but he's not ready to hold me.
Then, you didn't tell him what we believe?
[Chuckling] The chances of convincing a hardheaded sheriff... that we were dealing with a vampire seemed slim.
Very.
Yet I am satisfied that such is the case.
Alucard is undoubtedly a vampire... probably a descendant of Count Dracula.
Are you sure we're not allowing our imagination to run away with our common sense?
Can you suggest any other explanation for the events of the past few days?
No.
Neither can I give a lucid explanation of a vampire.
Broadly speaking, a vampire is an earthbound spirit... whose body comes to life at night and scours the countryside, satisfying a ravenous appetite for the blood of the living.
This it does by drawing it from the throat of its victim.
That's a nauseating thought!
They're supposed to be immortals, no doubt?
Practically.
So long as they return to their graves before sunrise.
Between then and sunset, they remain in a sort of, uh, cataleptic state, during which they can be destroyed by two different means.
At night, however, they are invulnerable.
You mean you believe Frank shot through Alucard without hurting him?
[Chuckling] Bullets would have had no effect on him.
It's strange to hear a man of science like yourself... calmly admit that he believes in a superstition so fantastic.
I could spend days citing proof that it is not mere superstition.
My own homeland in the Carpathian
Hills where Count Dracula lived... is sad testimony to its truth.
What was once a happy, productive region is today barren waste... villages depopulated, the land abandoned.
Maybe that's why he left there and came here to a younger country, stronger and more virile.
Of course... and he will fasten on it and drain it dry, just as he did his homeland.
Unless... we can find his grave and destroy him in it.
His grave? He was buried in Hungary, wasn't he?
Yes, but you will find that one of the chests he brought... contains a layer of soil from his birthplace.
That constitutes a grave.
Are you serious?
Rest assured he has it hidden in some safe place... and returns to it just before sunrise every morning.
Our job seems to be to find that chest with him in it and destroy him.
That won't be as simple as it sounds.
The vampire can assume very many different forms at will.
Sometimes it appears as a bat, sometimes as a werewolf... and sometimes as a small cloud of swirling vapor.
In this way it can move unseen among its enemies, learn their plans and be in a position to outwit them.
You are very brilliant, aren't you, Professor Lazlo?
Perhaps too brilliant for your own good... and that of Dr. Brewster.
You're right.
I am here because this is a young and virile race, not dry and decadent like ours.
They have what I want, what I need, what I must have.
Do you suppose that I would allow any mortal to stand in my way?
Here, drink this.
Thanks.
This doesn't leave me much room to go on disputing your theories.
How in the world did you drive him away?
I showed him this.
A simple cross!
It would take too long to explain why they fear it, but they do.
Keep this and wear it at all times, especially in your sleep.
Dracula has you marked for death.
Not only me, but unsuspecting people in this district... who'd never believe us if we tried to warn them.
We must find some way to destroy him before... [Knocking]
Excuse me, Doctor Harry, but it's Mrs. Land to see you.
Something's happened to Tommy, Doctor.
Put him here.
I sent him to my sister's on an errand.
He was gone so long,
I finally went after him.
- Will you get my bag?
- Certainly.
I found him lying beside the road.
He talked a little, but he didn't make sense.
He acted like he was scared foolish.
He said something about a foreign man in a fog, but there wasn't any fog tonight, Doctor.
I noticed those wounds on his neck too.
What are they... small animal bites?
No, I don't think so.
We can fix that very easily.
Sarah?
Yes, Doctor Harry?
Why don't you make Mrs. Land a cup of tea?
Go along with Sarah, Mrs. Land.
Yes, sir.
Tommy's going to be all right.
He's had a bit of a shock.
I want him to stay here until he regains consciousness.
I'll call you.
Thank you, Doctor.
Dracula's first victim.
It's starting fast.
Does that mean that Tommy's in danger of becoming a vampire?
No, unless Alucard drained so much blood from him that he died.
What about Kay?
She died from bullet wounds, and yet you implied that she would become a vampire.
Yes, but her case was different.
Her background was...
I know... morbid!
She'd gone overboard on the subject of the supernatural,
- black magic and the like.
- Exactly.
I rather believe that Miss Caldwell may have made the transition... from choice.
No one could choose a thing so loathsome!
Don't forget, the girl was morbid.
That means thanatophobia, fear of death.
And Alucard could promise her eternal life.
Eternal life at such a price?
Why do you think she is a vampire?
The dirt which I understand had been thrown into her grave... who else would have done that except Alucard... Dracula?
That means we have to destroy her as well?
That should be relatively simple.
Her sister could order her cremation while the body is still in the morgue.
Perhaps you're right.
[Phone Ringing]
Hello. Oh, hello, Claire.
I was just about to call you.
No, I think that'll be perfectly safe.
Professor Lazlo and I will stop and pick you up.
It's no trouble. Besides, there's something we want to talk to you about.
All right.
See you in a few minutes then.
The sheriff s office just called her.
They say that Frank is still a bit irrational and insists upon seeing her.
While she's there, she can leave orders for Katherine's cremation.
Oh, Sarah?
Mrs. Land?
Unfortunately,
I have to run along.
In a few minutes, it'll be safe to take Tommy home.
Don't you worry.
He's gonna be all right.
Thank you, Doctor.
[Kay]
Frank?
Frank.
Frank.
Kay.
No, it can't be.
Yes, Frank, it's Katherine.
No, you can't be Kay.
Kay's dead!
I know, I killed her.
I saw her fall.
I was with the sheriff when he found her body.
She was dead.
She was dead!
I saw her!
You see me now too.
- Yes, but...
- Do you doubt your own eyes?
It is you.
It is you, Kay, and you're alive!
But what is it, Kay?
You seem to be cold, like death.
You seem to be Kay, but there's a strange difference.
It's almost as if I didn't know you.
Does that mean you no longer love me?
I'll always love you.
Enough to spend the rest of your life with me? But...
But you're married to Alucard.
I don't love him.
I never did.
- But you're married to him!
- I had to.
It was part of the plan
I told you about in the garden.
I asked you to have faith in me then.
I beg you to have faith in me now.
I don't understand.
Count Alucard is immortal.
Through him,
I attained immortality.
Through me, you will do the same, and we will spend eternity together.
Are you serious?
Do you expect me to believe anything so unreal?
How can you explain the fact you shot through him without hurting him?
How else could I be here?
Why, I can't explain it.
It's... it's so incredible!
Perhaps you'll understand when I tell you...
Count Alucard's real name is Count Dracula.
Count Dracula?
You mean the Hungarian who's supposed to have become...
Don't use that word.
We don't like it.
Say, rather, that we are undead, immortal.
Do you mean you deliberately planned this?
You married him so you could become a...
So you and I could attain immortality, yes.
But even if it would work, do you expect me to agree to anything so fantastic?
You have no choice.
I've taken the first step while you were sleeping.
No.
No, I can't do it.
I've already told you, you have no choice.
Frank, isn't eternity together... better than a few years of ordinary life?
Yes.
Yes, I suppose it is.
There's one thing you must do while you're still in your present form.
- What is that?
- Destroy Dracula.
"Destroy Dracula"?
But how?
There is one advantage all humans have over us.
You can move about in the daytime.
We can't.
We must return to our graves before sunrise, or we're destroyed.
But how can I keep him from his grave?
You don't have to.
You can destroy him in one of two ways... either drive a stake through his heart, or burn his grave before he reaches it.
You must do this,
Frank, for us.
Miss Caldwell! It got so late,
I didn't think you were coming in.
I thought you might have told Frank, and I didn't want to disappoint him.
I don't suppose we're allowed to see him too?
Sheriff says no.
Find out if he knows where Count
Alucard keeps himself during the day.
I'll try.
[Door Unlocking]
[Jailer]
Third one on your left.
- Hello, Frank.
- Hello, Claire.
It's nice of you to come... after everything.
I can only stay a few minutes.
I just wanted to tell you that I know it was an accident.
That makes me feel better.
Kay understands too.
I'm... sure she does.
I know it, because she...
Would you think I was losing my mind if I told... you that Kay has been here to talk to me?
I'd be more likely to say you'd been dreaming.
Yes, I guess you're right.
I was dreaming.
You know, they'll never convict
Stanley of that killing.
- No?
- No-ho!
He's as nutty as a filbert.
He's been back there talking to some dame who wasn't there.
First he talks in his voice, then he answers in the woman's voice.
Did you hear anything that was said?
That'd be a swell way to spend a rainy evening... eavesdropping on some goof talking to himself in two voices.
Huh! Some fun!
Dr. Brewster's doing all he can for you, Frank.
All he can do is get me out of here on an insanity plea.
- That shouldn't be hard.
- You mustn't even think such things.
Why not? I can't be sane.
I really believe Kate came here to talk to me.
If that's not crazy...
When are they going to hold the funeral?
We haven't been able to contact Count Alucard so far.
Do you happen to know where he stays during the day?
Why during the day?
It's an unpleasant trip out there at night, and there's no phone.
Why should anyone think
I know?
You saw him meet Kay on the road once, and I wondered if you saw where he came from.
I'm sorry.
I don't know anything.
I suppose you'll be burying her at Dark Oaks.
Yes, I think so.
At least her ashes will be taken there.
- Her ashes?
- Yes.
I'm going to leave an order for her cremation.
You can't do that.
You can't do that, I tell you!
She isn't dead! I know!
She talked to me!
You can't cremate her!
It would kill her!
I won't let you burn her now that she's immortal!
You mustn't excite yourself.
Reconcile yourself to the fact that Kay is dead.
But she isn't!
- I know she isn't dead!
- Let her go!
But she isn't dead.
All right, Frank.
I think you'd better leave,
Miss Caldwell.
- You must listen to me.
- Frank, try and get some sleep.
Good night, Frank.
Kay?
Kay!
Did you hear what she said?
They're going to cremate you.
Yes, I heard.
That means Dr. Brewster has guessed the truth.
We may have to eliminate him and Claire.
No, not your own sister.
She's no longer my sister when she interferes with me.
But if they cremate you...
They won't find me.
I'll go to
Dark Oaks tonight.
But we'll never be safe as long as Dr. Brewster's alive.
Our first worry's Alucard.
If I could get out of here,
I'd start hunting for him.
I'll get you out, but you won't have to hunt for Alucard.
- I know where he can be found in the daytime. - Where?
Remember the drainage flume near the edge of the swamp?
- Yes.
- That's the place.
Be sure you don't get there until after the sun is up. [Door Squeaking]
Didn't I tell you to get some sleep?
I couldn't go to sleep.
I was talking to someone.
Yeah.
Well, she's gone now, so I'll just douse the lights.
I'll wait for you at Dark Oaks, in the playroom Claire and I used to have in the attic.
I'll unlock the cell and bring you a gun.
There is very little doubt in my mind... that Kay has visited
Frank in his cell, and I'm afraid for one very definite purpose.
What purpose?
Didn't you tell me that she and
Frank have always been in love?
Ever since they were children. Why?
Well, it's an unpleasant thought, but there are cases on record... where the living have voluntarily joined the ranks of the undead... in order to consummate what might be called... an unholy alliance.
You can't be serious!
Such a pact between
Kay and Frank is unthinkable!
Perhaps.
But so long as there is the remotest possibility... and I insist there is... we must arrange for immediate cremation.
Otherwise she will destroy her own soul and Frank's.
- Frank!
- Get back! Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!
Frank!
Frank Stanley!
- What happened?
- Frank Stanley just escaped!
- Look out, he's armed. - Get after him!
If you have to shoot, do it.
What happened, Mack?
How'd he get out?
I don't know, Sheriff.
The keys were on the desk as usual.
Now they're gone and so is Stanley.
I tried to stop him...
Ooh!
Did you have anything to do with this,
Dr. Brewster?
Certainly not!
We are as anxious as you to keep him locked up.
More so. Did you hear him do any more talking to that girl?
What girl?
Katherine Caldwell.
Katherine Cald...
It's some kind of a crazy trick Stanley pulls.
He pretends to be talking to some girl... first in his voice, then in hers.
Is this some trick so he'd sound crazy?
Did you listen in as we asked you to?
Yeah.
- But it was too crazy to bother about.
- For instance?
Well, the girl's voice said something about getting him out of jail.
[Lazlo] That wasn't so crazy, was it?
He's out.
That's right.
I never thought of that.
Do you think there was someone in there with him?
Never mind that.
What else did he say, however crazy it was?
She said something about meeting him at Dark Oaks in some kid playroom.
I know where. What else?
Oh, some crazy stuff about killing Count Alucard.
Did he say kill him or destroy him?
Come to think of it,
I believe he did say
"destroy," shove a stake through him or something.
- Shove a stake through him?
- Yeah.
- We're dealing with a madman.
- Obviously.
Did he say anything that would give us an idea... where he expected to find Alucard?
Yeah, but that really was crazy.
She said something about a swamp with a drainage tunnel...
I know where that is too.
We'll get right out and warn Alucard before Frank gets there.
You'll not warn him if we have to lock you up in jail.
What's that?
There's a lot you don't understand.
If you doubt it, let's take a look in that morgue.
- What's the morgue got to do with it?
- Never mind.
- It's becoming as plain as day.
- It has been to me for some time.
Then let's go take a look in that morgue.
Okay.
- The coffin is gone, corpse and all!
- Of course.
- You sound as if you expected it.
- We did.
What's your part in this?
How do you know in advance what's happening?
We'd better get to where Alucard is hiding.
We'll explain it on the way.
I thought you weren't going to warn Alucard.
We're not.
But we may have to save Frank from the count and from his own madness.
Gentlemen, the farther we go, the crazier you sound.
Well! It is seldom that my enemies are so accommodating.
How did you learn where to find me?
I know all about you.
You're not Count Alucard but Count Dracula, one of the undead... a loathsome thing, surviving on the blood of the living.
There'll be no more blood of the living for you, because I'm going to destroy you!
If you had learned more about me, you wouldn't have come here until after sunrise.
Now it is not I that is going to be destroyed.
Put it out!
Put it out, do you hear me?
Put it out!
Put it out!
Put it out!
You stay here,
Jack.
This is one thing we didn't foresee, Doctor.
How could we?
I don't get it.
What's happened?
To maintain his existence among the undead,
Dracula had to be back in his coffin before sunrise.
Frank prevented it, as you can see.
You mean, that's all that's left of Alucard?
Look at the ring on his hand.
It bears the Alucard seal, just as on his luggage.
Assuming it is Alucard or Dracula or whoever, where is Frank Stanley?
He's still wanted for murder.
Do you still think Frank killed Kay deliberately?
Look, Doctor, I'm only the sheriff.
I'm not the judge.
It's my job to bring him in and the court to decide he's guilty.
Of course, but I think our testimony will have bearing on their decision.
Undoubtedly.
But the main thing to do now is to find Frank, and I think I know where he is.
[Fire Crackling]
- How do you do, Mr. Van Cleve?
- Good afternoon, Your Excellency.
- Very kind of you to receive me.
- Not at all.
- Oh, please. Sit down.
- Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, but we're so busy down here.
Really, sometimes it looks as if the whole world is coming to hell.
Frankly, I haven't had an opportunity to familiarize myself with your case.
When did it happen, Mr. Van Cleve?
Tuesday. To be exact,
I died at 9:36 in the evening.
I trust you didn't suffer much.
Oh, no, no.
Not in the least.
I had finished my dinner... -
- A good one, I hope.
- Oh, excellent, excellent.
I ate everything the doctor forbade, and then... well, to make a long story short... shall we say,
I fell asleep without realizing it.
And when I awakened, there were all my relatives speaking in low tones... and saying nothing but the kindest things about me.
Then I knew I was dead.
I presume your funeral was satisfactory.
Well, there was a lot of crying, so...
I believe everybody had a good time.
It would have been an ideal funeral if
Mrs. Cooper-Cooper, a friend of the family... hadn't volunteered to sing
"The End of a Perfect Day."
You see, all my life I had succeeded in
avoiding Mrs. Cooper-Cooper's coloratura... and this undoubtedly was her revenge.
Mr. Van Cleve, I can see that you have a sensitive, cultivated ear.
Oh, thank you.
Then let me warn you.
The music down here is anything but pleasant.
Beethoven, Bach, Mozart... - you hear them only... above.
Yes. I know.
It won't be easy not to hear the old masters again.
And there are several people up there I would love to see.
Particularly one.
A very dear one.
- But I haven't a chance.
- Have you tried?
No, Your Excellency.
I have no illusions.
I know the life I lived.
I know where I belong.
I would like to get it over as quickly as possible.
Very well. If you meet our requirements, we'll be only too glad to accommodate you.
Would you be good enough to mention, for instance... some outstanding crime you've committed?
Crime? Crime?
I'm afraid I can't think of any.
But I can safely say my whole life was one continuous misdemeanor.
My dear Mr. Van Cleve, a passport to hell is not issued on generalities.
No. I'm afraid you'll have to wait until I have time to study your record.
Now look here.
I have to see His Excellency...
and no office boy's
going to stop me.
I beg your pardon, Your Excellency... -
- Just a moment.
- I'm Edna Craig.
Oh, yes. I have your record here.
You'll be taken care of in just a moment.
I don't want to seem rude, but I don't think I belong here.
- In just a moment... -
- Please don't misunderstand me.
I think it is a charming place.
Isn't it?
Henry Van Cleve.
You know Edna Craig?
I'm sorry, madam.
I seem to be at a loss.
Oh, Henry.
Think back... - many, many years.
The little brownstone house around the corner from the old Waldorf?
Oh.
Marmaduke Harrison's party.
We were all dressed as children.
And you came as, uh,
Little Lord Fauntleroy.
And they wheeled you in in a baby carriage.
Little Constantinople.
Oh, Henry.
No girl in New York walked on two more beautiful legs than you.
Little Constantinople.
Well, Henry, I still walk... - and on the same two legs.
And I'm sure they're still as beautiful.
Well, Henry, I'll let you be the judge of that.
Those things are better left to memory.
But I must admit you're beginning to interest me, Mr. Van Cleve.
I think I can spare the time to listen to your story.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Please sit down.
Perhaps the best way to tell you the story of my life... is to tell you about the women in my life.
Well, let's start with the first woman.
My mother.
A lovely lady, but prejudiced.
She thought I was wonderful.
She was the first woman I ever fooled.
Then there was my grandmother.
She was just as prejudiced
as my mother.
How is the little darling?
Let me hold him.
No. Please, Mother Van Cleve.
Let the baby rest.
- You're just jealous, Bertha.
- I can't stand this any longer.
- I'm going to speak to Randolph about this.
- Yes, Randolph.
First you take my son away, and now you want to alienate my grandchild.
My diapers needed changing,
and already women were fighting for me.
What a way to start a man
on the road oflife.
I was not even two,
and I already got involved in a triangle.
At home, in the presence of my family,
I was the only man in my nurse's life.
I was her honeybunch,
her "oogi-woogi-woo."
But the minute we got to the park... -
Hello, Bedelia.
Well, if it isn't Patrick himself.
Ah, shut up, you nasty little brat.
No wonder I became a cynic.
My next lesson
came from little Mary.
- Hello, Mary.
- Don't speak to me, Henry Van Cleve.
You're a bad boy, and my mother says
I shouldn't talk to bad boys.
I bet you don't know what I've got in this box.
And I'm not interested,
Henry Van Cleve.
Then I won't tell you it's a beetle.
A beetle?
- Do you like it?
- Oh, who doesn't like beetles?
- It's yours.
- Thank you.
Oh, thank you, Henry.
- I wonder if I should take it.
- If you don't want it... -
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.
I was just wondering.
Don't worry.
I've got another one.
- Another beetle?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, it's beautiful.
It looks rather lonely though.
You know what I think?
I think it wants to be together with mine.
You mean you want this one too?
Henry Van Cleve! Do you think I'm the kind of girl that would take a boy's last beetle?
Aw, that's all right.
You can have it.
Thank you, Henry. Now, if you want to, you can walk with me to the corner.
From that moment on,
one thing was clear to me.
If you want to win a girl,
you have to have lots ofbeetles.
I was growing rapidly,
and so was New York.
Yes. New York was becoming
cosmopolitan...
and no household was considered fashionable
without a French maid.
So, one day a Fifth Avenue coach
stopped in front of our house...
and out of the coach
and into my life came Mademoiselle.
Mrs. Van Cleve will be here shortly.
Merci.
That's Mr. Van Cleve.
Oh, Monsieur.
Charmant, charmant.
This is Mr. Van Cleve's father.
He lives here too.
Grandpapa.
Sweet. Very sweet.
And who is this darling little boy?
That's the young master.
He's not so darling.
- Bad boy?
- Not good.
- Good morning.
- Bonjour, madame.
How do you do, mademoiselle?
- Your name is, uh... -
- Yvette Blanchard.
- Yvette Blanchard.
- Oui.
The agency tells me that you've just arrived from France.
- Oui.
- And are seeking employment in this country.
- Oui, madame.
- Uh, you have references?
- Oui, madame.
- May I see them, please?
Naturellement.
- Voilà.
- Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, they're in French.
Oui, madame. But believe me... -
toutes les références... - excellentes.
Here, my last employer... -
Baroness Lalotte... wishes me to be such grand success in America... that I shall never have desire to return to France.
Ah. The French have such a... continental way of expressing their gratitude.
Um, and here a référence from the duc de Polignac.
He considers the two years
I spent in his house... the two most happy years of his life.
Oh, it sounds just like a duke.
Um, what about your wages?
Uh, maybe in beginning $20 a month would give satisfaction?
Twenty dollars a month!
You see, I've never gone higher than $14 a month for a personal maid.
If I could only justify the difference.
Let me see.
- Oh, Mother?
- Come here, dear.
- Mademoiselle, this is my little boy.
- Bonjour, mon petit.
- Hello.
- He studies French.
Oh, mademoiselle, you must ask him something in French. But not too difficult.
Oui. Avez-vous bien travaillé
aujourd'hui, mon chéri?
Huh?
That's what I was afraid of.
Now be a nice boy and go. I have an idea that I want to discuss with Mademoiselle.
A brilliant child, but a little backward in his French.
- And it just occurred to me that... -
- Oh, madame.
It will be pleasure talk only French to little fellow.
My whole vocabulaire
I make present to your baby.
With me in house, in one month I assure
Madame will not recognize own son.
And only for $20.
Of course, that's six dollars more than I ever paid before.
- But let's try it.
- Merci, madame.
- Au revoir, madame.
- Good-bye, mademoiselle.
Psst! Hey.
Oui?
You're not gonna work here.
I'll see to that.
What is the matter?
Did I make little boy angry?
Now see here. That's the last time anybody's gonna call me "little boy."
Oh, so sorry if I hurt feelings, but maman... -
Yes. Mama.
That's the trouble.
Mama and Papa.
And Grandpapa and Grandmama.
It's a conspiracy to keep me in short pants.
They think they own me, body and soul.
Ah, je comprends. My understanding for young man is perfect.
Your soul is bigger than your pants.
Oh, you need very warm friend with sympathy.
Moi. I will be. Oui?
I bet you couldn't guess in a million years what I have in my pocket.
No, I do not know, but I am sure it is something very bad, oui?
- Here.
- Oh, you smoke big black cigar?
Sure, I'm gonna smoke it... - any day now.
Now we have very bad secret together, oui?
That's nothing.
I can tell you things that would rock
Fifth Avenue to its foundations.
Oh?
- I'm going to get married.
- You, married?
Mmm.
I have to, darn it.
Oh, this is much worse than cigar.
When did disaster take place?
Oh, it all happened pretty suddenly.
There's a girl around the corner.
Well, you know.
But I do not know.
Tell me.
Well, we were walking in the park, and it started to rain.
- Oui?
- We climbed into a policeman's shed.
- And the policeman?
- He wasn't there.
Well, anyhow, before I knew it, I lost my head.
I don't know what got into me.
- I took her into my arms and then... -
- And then?
I kissed her.
I may just as well face the consequences.
Excuse my asking question.
This might sound very childish to grown-up young man... but did you ever consider idea not marrying girl?
It's out of the question.
It would destroy me socially.
I could never go to Harvard.
Why, when my father kissed my mother... she knew what he meant, and he knew she knew it.
écoute, mon chéri.
In your papa's time, papa kiss mama and then marry.
But this is 1887.
Time of bicycle. The typewriter has arrivé.
Soon everybody speak over the telephone.
And people have new idea of value of kiss.
What was bad yesterday is lot of fun today.
There is a wonderful saying in France.
"Les baisers sont comme des bonbons...
qu'on mange parce qu'ils sont bons."
This mean kiss is like candy.
You eat candy only for the beautiful taste... and this is enough reason to eat candy.
Y-You mean I can kiss a girl once... -
Ten times, 20 times.
And no obligation.
Listen, are you telling me the truth or just trying to keep your job?
I'll swear by the extra six dollar
I get from Madame.
Gosh. This is a wonderful age
I'm living in.
Oui. So you do not have to worry about little girl.
Oh, I've forgotten about her already.
I guess I'm pretty blasé.
- Listen, Frenchy.
- What is it, my friend?
If that's the way things are in 1887... what do you think's gonna happen in 1888?
Aha. We make that the subject of our first French lesson.
Au revoir, monsieur.
- Mother.
- Yes, my baby.
That girl is worth the extra six dollars.
The pride
of all the Van Cleves was my cousin Albert.
He was the fulfillment of a parent's dream.
Always the highest in his class.
Never had he thrown a stone into a window.
Nor did he ever put a mouse
in his teacher's bustle.
His ears were always clean.
This, I think, will give you
a rough idea of Albert.
And I'll never forget
the morning of my 15th birthday.
The presents were waiting for me
in the living room.
But suddenly Father came running
down the stairs, excited and breathless.
Flogdell! Flogdell!
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.
Tell Robinson to go immediately and get Dr. Macintosh.
- Tell him our little Henry is ill.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, my poor baby.
The boy's acting so strangely, Randolph.
Randolph.
Now, Bertha, Bertha.
We must keep a stiff upper lip.
Randolph, he's talking all the time as if he were in a delirium.
- What does the boy seem to be saying?
- Well, if I only knew, Randolph.
- He's talking French. Nothing but French.
- French?
Oh, Randolph.
Our boy, delirious in a foreign language.
Now, Bertha, Bertha. This is an emergency.
We must do everything step-by-step.
The next move is to find out what the boy is saying.
Uh... - Uh, Flogdell.
- Yes, sir.
- Tell Mademoiselle to come to
Master Henry's room immediately.
Very good, sir.
If only Grandpa would let me rub just a bit of garlic on his little chest.
Stay away from that boy with your garlic.
The boy's sick enough.
Randolph, did you hear that?
Did you hear that, Grandpa?
I'm not deaf.
The child's poisoned.
That's what it is.
Oh, Randolph. What shall we do?
Oh, what shall we do?
Now, now. There's only one thing to do, Bertha... - keep a stiff upper lip.
But that won't help that poor poisoned boy.
If I had my way,
I know what I'd do.
A big glass of cold water right in that boy's face, and I think he'd start talking English.
- Hugo, you barbarian.
- Oh, no! Please, please!
- You'll give him pneumonia.
- You mustn't do that.
- Please, you mustn't... -
- He might... -
- Oh, Mademoiselle.
- Did Madame send for me?
Yes, Mademoiselle.
Our little Henry.
- He's sick?
- Yes, Mademoiselle.
Oh. Excuse, Madame.
I'll be right back.
- Oui, Madame?
- Mademoiselle, he's asking for something in French.
- You must help us find out what he wants.
- Oui, Madame.
- Look. He's smiling.
- He's far, far away.
- Why, he seems to be in another world.
- He's looking at Mademoiselle.
- I wonder what he sees.
- Yes. I wonder.
Oh, je suis si malade.
Mon estomac me fait si mal.
- Is he clear?
- Does it make any sense?
Oh, his French is absolutely perfect.
Such beautiful grammar.
Mademoiselle, at the moment we're not concerned with the young man's linguistic accomplishments.
- Don't be harsh.
- I'm sorry if I seem to have lost my temper, but the occasion is a trying one.
If you could tell us what the child is saying, it might help us to meet the situation.
Must be contagious disease.
Son, step out with me a moment.
- Good morning!
- Morning, Albert.
- Shh! Hush.
- What's going on?
Now, Son, you still don't know what's the matter with that boy?
Father, I wouldn't presume to make a diagnosis.
- After all, I'm not a man of medicine.
- Randolph, how old are you?
What an odd question, Father.
I'm 43.
Well, I think you are definitely old enough to be told the facts of life.
- What are you driving at, Father?
- Now, Son, don't look at me with those big wandering eyes.
It breaks my heart, but I'll have to shatter your childhood illusions.
Randolph, my son, there is no Santy Claus.
And that child of your... -
Listen, don't you really know what's the matter with him?
- You get out of here!
- Bertha, what is it?
- Randolph, call the police at once.
- Yes. Call the police.
Quiet! Quiet!
We don't need the police.
Bertha, Mother. I wish someone would take the time to explain to me what this is all about.
Believe me, Monsieur, the excitement is greatly exagéré.
- How dare you speak.
- Have you no shame?
- Oh, please, Grandpapa.
- Don't you call him Grandpapa!
- Don't you dare call him Grandpapa!
- Girls, girls... - Shut up!
Go ahead.
Call me Grandpapa.
Merci, Monsieur. Merci beaucoup, Monsieur.
You are very kind.
Yes, I'm very kind, but you'd better go and pack your things now.
And if you're not out of the house in a very little while, I'll come down to your room and help you pack.
I wish you would, Grandpapa.
- Oh, shameless, shameless!
- Leave this house! Go!
There is old French saying: If you are thrown out of house, you better resign.
Au revoir.
I still would appreciate it if someone would tell me what all this has to do with our little Henry.
Fortunately, Uncle Randolph,
French always being one of my favorite subjects...
I was able to understand the incredible conversation between Henry and Mademoiselle.
- I, uh, don't know how to begin.
- All right, all right.
Henry had a glass of wine.
We all know that.
Henry? Intoxicated?
From what I overheard, at or about 10:00 last night...
Henry and this... - this foreign young woman slipped out of the house.
Before doing this, however, Henry wrongfully took possession of his father's dress clothes... including $20 which Uncle Randolph was negligent enough to leave in his pocket.
Imagine. They went to Delmonico's.
- Did they have a good time?
- They drank champagne.
Our little baby drank champagne.
- Well, thank you, Albert.
- But that's not all, Grandfather.
It seems, from what I could gather, that Mrs. Asterbrook, of the Asterbrooks... who was sitting at an adjoining table... resented bitterly the idea of Henry dropping a nickel into her décolletage... and complaining to the management because no chocolate bar dropped out of Mrs. Asterbrook.
Mrs. Asterbrook?
How can I ever face her?
What a disgrace!
I'm going to teach that boy a lesson.
Yes, that's what he deserves... - throwing nickels around like that.
Knowing the Asterbrooks, I can tell you right now we'll never see that nickel again.
I have reached my decision.
That boy is going to be spanked... - and severely.
Oh, Randolph, don't hurt him.
Please don't hurt him.
- No, no, Randolph.
- Please, please. He's such a baby.
- Well, I assume there will be no further birthday celebration.
- I'm afraid not.
I believe I can utilize this time very beneficially, so I'll say good-bye.
Good-bye, Albert.
You're a real credit to the family.
Thank you, Grandfather.
It was a Sunday morning,
the day of my 26th birthday.
Oh, that boy.
Well, at least poor Grandmother... - may her soul rest in peace... - was spared seeing a day like this.
Oh, Randolph. Randolph, where can he be?
Where can he be?
Now, now, Bertha.
I'd like to give you some consolation... but all I can say is chins up.
Oh, Randolph, where does he get it from?
I give up, Bertha.
I never gambled in all my life.
I never got entangled with any girl until I met you.
- Randolph, you call it entangled?
- I mean you entangled my heart.
Oh, of course, Randolph.
We entangled each other's heart.
Believe me, Bertha, I never knew what a musical comedy girl looked like.
What can he possibly derive from their company?
To me, they were creatures from another planet.
Where does he get it from?
Nobody in our family was musical.
To this day I wouldn't know how to find the stage entrance to a theater.
It's always around in the back up an alleyway.
There's a sign over the door:
"Stage Entrance." You can't miss it.
But I'm not interested, Father.
I never was.
Where does the boy get it from?
Where does he get it from?
Father built up the Van Cleve
Importing Company from nothing.
When he stopped, I carried on.
Dad, you must admit, from the day I left Harvard,
I earned every dollar I ever spent.
Then why do you give him money without making him work for it?
I have to save the family name. What about you handing him hundreds of dollars?
- If I'd come to you for money, would you have given it to me?
- No.
But you give it to him.
Why? Why? Why?
Because I like him.
Does that mean, by any chance, Father, that you don't like me?
Son, I love you.
Now shut up and leave me alone.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Aunt Bertha.
- Good morning, Albert.
- Good morning, Grandfather.
- Morning, Albert.
- Good morning, Uncle Randolph.
- Good morning, Albert.
I just came in to bring a little birthday remembrance for Henry.
Anything wrong?
Isn't he home?
If I know my cousin Henry, he's probably still in church.
I mean that humorously.
Albert, I'm struggling successfully against the gout...
I'm waging a terrific battle with my liver, and I'm holding my own against asthma... but I doubt if I have strength enough to survive your jokes.
You're a successful lawyer.
Let it go at that.
I love you, Albert.
Uh, it was sweet of you to drop in, Albert.
I hope he'll be here tonight to thank you.
I hope so too, otherwise I'd be in the most embarrassing position... as far as my future in-laws are concerned.
We're so eager to meet your fiancée.
How does she like New York?
Yes. Is she enjoying herself?
Well, she's only been here two days, so naturally the impression is overwhelming.
I took her to the aquarium. We rode up and down the elevator in the Flatiron Building... and naturally, we ended up in Grant's Tomb.
Naturally.
Uh, and her parents?
Oh, yes. How does the big
Kansas City butcher like New York?
- Now, Father, please.
- I assume that you're referring to... my future father-in-law, who happens to be one of the great meat-packers of our time.
Yes, Father Van Cleve. Don't you realize that every piece of beef we eat... comes from one of
Mr. Strable's many, many plants?
Does that include the steak
I fought 10 rounds with last night?
Grandfather, you don't seem to have any idea of the importance of Mr. Strable.
He created the most famous character in American advertising... - Mabel, the cow.
You've seen her, Father, on billboards.
That big, happy cow smiling at you over the fence... and saying in big letters, um, uh... -
How does it go?
"To the world my name is Mabel, which you'll find on every label.
I am packed by E.F. Strable, for the pleasure of your table."
No cow in its right mind could have said anything like that.
- Sounds more like Mr. Strable.
- Grandfather, please, I beg of you.
The family understands your humor, but it's a typical kind of New York humor.
In other words, it's not for yokels, huh?
I beg your pardon, sir. Mr. Henryjust came home.
He went directly upstairs.
Aunt Bertha, when you see Henry, will you tell him that as a Van Cleve...
I have the right to demand that he keep the shadow of scandal off our name?
You see, my future in-laws are, so to speak, pioneer people, and... -
"Packed by E.F. Strable...
for the pleasure of our table."
Holy smoke!
- Good-bye, Aunt Bertha.
- Uh, good-bye, Albert.
- Well, this time I was firm.
- Good, Randolph. What happened?
He asked for a hundred dollars, but I told him.
I told him I'd let him have only 50.
- Randolph... -
- And not right away.
For the first time in 27 years of marriage,
I feel like criticizing you.
What do you want me to do?
Spank a 26-year-old boy?
No, but at least I expected a verbal lashing.
- Are you all right, my boy?
- Yes, Mother.
Many happy returns of the day. Ohh.
Mother, I'm sorry if I made you unhappy.
Oh, Grandfather and Father and I are worried to death about you.
You don't give your family a single thought.
All you think about is having what you call a good time.
Mother, I went out last night to raise Cain.
- Son, you mustn't talk like that.
- Don't worry. I didn't.
I couldn't.
I couldn't get her out of my mind.
Son, you worry me.
Are you well?
Mother... when you saw Father for the first time, did you feel that unmistakable something?
Did you feel an electric spark from your head right down to your toes... that swept over you like a hurricane and threw you to the ground... but you bounced up again and floated over the treetops?
Spark? A hurricane?
Heaven forbid.
I never had such a feeling.
Henry, where do you get it from?
Not from me. And certainly your father never had any spark.
Mother, all I'm trying to say is...
I met a girl yesterday.
Oh. I hope she comes from a good family.
I don't know.
And frankly, I don't care.
Mother, when one sees a lovely rose... -
One can be certain she comes from a fine rosebush.
Mother, even if this girl's father turned out to be something of a buttercup, I wouldn't care.
What's her name?
Where does she live?
I wish I knew.
She isn't one of those musical comedy girls?
Oh, no, Mother.
It's an entirely different kind of music.
It's not the hootchy-kootchy.
It's not the cancan.
It's like a waltz by Strauss.
Like a minuet by Mozart.
Henry, where do you get it from?
From you, Mother.
Now, you must be just.
When I was a little boy, you wanted me to believe in fairy tales... and now that one has really happened... -
You remember that story about the young man... -
I think he was a shepherd who was walking in the woods... -
Oh, you've been in the country.
No, no, Mother.
It happened right on Broadway.
Suddenly the young man saw a big castle... and leaning out of the window was the most beautiful princess.
Nothing could stop him.
He climbed up the parapet of the castle... -
Henry. You haven't broken into the Waldorf again?
Mother, darling, let's forget the fairy tale.
Well, it's about time you grew up.
I came here to scold you, and I'm going to do it.
Now, look at your cousin Albert.
Not much older than you are and already a corporation lawyer... engaged to a lovely girl of a well-known family.
Henry, now, this may sound severe, but you've got to pull yourself together and settle down.
Mother, I don't think I'll ever find this girl, but if I did, then all your troubles would be over.
If she didn't want me to gamble,
I wouldn't look at another card.
I'd stay home every night.
Mother, I might even go to work.
Henry, that's wonderful.
I don't know about the girl... but the fact that you have the desire to settle down makes me so happy.
For the first time you're beginning to sound like your father.
Uh, Mother, I don't know where this girl is, so don't expect too much.
Oh, now listen to your mother.
Don't worry about that girl.
Another girl will come along.
- I'll look for one myself. How's that?
- Fine. Fine, Mother.
And when I find a girl for you, she'll be Miss Right.
And do you know where we'll find her?
In the home of Mr. and Mrs. Right.
Oh, Henry, you're making me so happy.
Mother, I was riding around for hours and hours trying to forget this girl.
Oh, child, don't worry.
Well, it was very expensive.
The cab is still waiting out in front... and the driver was so nice to me that I promised him, if... -
I know. Your heart's always bigger than your father's pocketbook.
Look under your pillow.
I put something there last night.
Oh, Mother.
Sometimes I wonder if you're not spoiling me.
- Here, dear.
- Oh, thank you.
Well, this is a great occasion.
You must be proud of your Albert.
- Yes, I think we have a pretty good son.
- Oh.
- I hear the Strable family... -
- We couldn't ask anything better for our Albert.
- Oh, wonderful.
- Mr. and Mrs. Strable and Miss Strable.
Good evening, Grandfather, Aunt Bertha,
Uncle Randolph, dear, dear family.
It is my privilege and honor to present Mr. and Mrs. E.F. Strable.
And last but not least, well... here she is.
- How do you do, madam?
- How do you do?
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to the pleasure of meeting you.
All my life I've wanted to see the wide-open spaces.
Well, if Muhammad can't go to the mountain, the mountain must come to Muhammad.
You're welcome, Mrs. Strable.
- Yes, we're pretty proud of Kansas.
- Naturally.
And you, Mr. Strable, welcome to our family.
Mr. Van Cleve, we people from the West don't talk much... but when we say something, we mean it.
- Thank you.
- Thank you for giving me the chance... to meet the man who feeds the nation.
I hope this will be the beginning of a lifelong friendship.
May you lie as solidly anchored in our hearts as you do in our stomachs.
And, uh, Grandfather, this is Martha.
So, this is Martha, huh?
Well, Martha.
- Yes, Mr. Van Cleve?
- Grandpa.
- Yes, Grandpa.
- If I were about 50 years younger...
I'd take you right away from that s... - splendid young man you're going to marry... and who is going to make you a wonderful husband.
Kiss your grandpa.
- Well, I see the mob has assembled.
- Yes, sir.
- Flogdell, is that... -
- That's Mr. Strable.
And that spreading chestnut tree under which Grandfather is standing?
That's Mrs. Strable.
And, uh, where's the lucky girl?
Standing beside your Aunt Minetta with her back to us.
She's just turning round.
Charming young lady, if I may say so.
Flogdell, I don't think
I can stand this party.
- Get my hat and coat.
- But, sir.
My hat and coat.
- Henry! There you are. Many happy returns.
- Thank you.
And now it's about time for you to come and meet the Strables.
- Where are you going?
- Out.
I beg you to stay and behave like a Van Cleve just once.
The Strables know it's your birthday, and they want to congratulate you. Oh, Martha. Martha.
- Yes, Albert?
- Dearest, I want you to meet Henry Van Cleve.
This is the cousin whose birthday we're celebrating today.
Many happy returns, Mr. Van Cleve.
- Cousin Henry.
- Cousin Henry.
- Thank you, Cousin Martha.
- Well, here she is, Henry.
Now I've done my duty bringing some new blood into the family. It'll be your turn next.
- That's most unlikely.
- Oh, nonsense.
All you need to do is to meet the right girl.
That's difficult, Albert.
I'm afraid I'll never have your luck.
Yes. No question about it. I'm lucky.
Well, shall we go in?
Father Strable. Father Strable.
Don't be afraid.
I should have told him.
It would have been the thing to do.
It shall remain our secret.
I promise.
Thank you.
Yes, we had a secret.
The most innocent secret I ever had.
It happened Saturday morning
in Wannamaker's Department Store.
Hello, Mother? I'm at the hairdresser's.
They're still doing my hair.
Yes. Oh, yes. just a moment, and I'll ask them how long it'll be.
Here was a girl lying to her mother.
Naturally, that girl interested me at once.
They say it'll take about 15 more minutes.
I'll be home at the most in half an hour.
Don't worry, Mother.
Good-bye.
Why was this angel lying to her mother?
I had to find out,
so I followed her.
But even if she hadn't lied to her mother,
I would have followed her anyway.
- May I help you, miss?
- Thank you.
I would like to see a... -
Are there no women clerks?
Unfortunately not.
But it might make you feel a little easier... if I tell you that I'm the one usually chosen by the management to handle... the more delicate situations.
As a matter of fact, they call me
"the bookworms' little mother."
Well, it's, uh... -
- Maybe I better come back some other time.
- Please, miss.
My employer is watching, and if he sees me losing a customer, it might cost me my job.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Naturally, I wouldn't like to deprive you of your livelihood.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you again and again.
- Well, the title of the book is, uh... -
- Yes?
I saw it in the corner of the second window... between To Have and to Hold and When Knighthood Was in Flower.
Hmm.
There you are.
I probably should apologize.
I imagine I should have called you madam.
No, it's still miss.
- But not for long, I presume.
- That's quite right.
- How much is the book?
- Oh.
We'll be only too glad to charge it if you would be kind enough to give me your name and address.
Thank you, but I'd rather pay.
How much?
- Uh, it's very expensive.
- Oh, that's all right.
Now, this is against the interests of Mr. Brentano... but since I am, so to speak, your literary confessor...
I must be honest with you.
Don't buy this book.
You don't need it.
I'll tell you something much more appropriate for you.
Leave your nest and fly away with me.
Well, I might buy that book too... -
Well, we don't have it in stock right now... but I'd love to discuss the idea with you, and if you like it... -
I'm afraid I haven't much time.
So, please, will you tell me?
How much is
How to Make Your Husband Happy?
Look at her. Dr. Blossom Franklin.
Now where could a woman like that
have found out how to make a husband happy?
You certainly don't want to learn anything from her.
You're so charming, so young and so beautiful.
I beg your pardon.
You shouldn't say such things.
You see, miss, when selling literature, one gets poetic.
And you must forgive me if I take poetic license once in a while.
I'd rather not discuss it any further, and if you don't mind, I'd like to buy this book.
I do mind. Now, imagine
I'm the man you're going to marry.
I couldn't imagine any such thing.
Well, what's the matter with me?
You think I'm that terrible?
Please. I just came in here to buy a book.
That's all.
I understand. But for the sake of discussion, let's say we are getting married.
Believe me. I don't want anybody to tell you how to make me happy.
The greatest gift you could bring me is to be just as you are... - adorable.
- All I want is a book.
- Stubborn, eh?
- What?
- Pardon my poetic license.
If you don't change your attitude,
I shall have to complain to your employer.
I'm not employed here.
I'm not a book salesman.
I took one look at you and followed you into the store.
If you'd walked into a restaurant,
I would have become a waiter.
If you'd walked into a burning building,
I would have become a fireman.
If you'd walked into an elevator,
I would have stopped it between two floors, and we'd have spent the rest of our lives there.
Please forgive me, but you can't walk out of my life like that.
I think your behavior's outrageous.
It's mad.
- I must insist that you leave me at once.
- Never. Never.
Is this man annoying you, miss?
If he is, just say so. I'll take care of him.
Am I annoying you?
Tell the officer.
No. The gentlemen was just saying good-bye.
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.
This was our terrible secret.
I'm terribly sorry, Albert.
Dearest, you don't seem to realize who's singing.
I know. Young Mrs. Cooper-Cooper.
If it were just a relative, it wouldn't be half so embarrassing.
But Mr. Cooper-Cooper is one of your most important clients. I haven't forgotten.
But what could I do?
I had to sneeze.
But you did it right in the middle of her aria... - and five times.
Because I had to sneeze five times.
Albert, suppose someday in the future
I had to sneeze... -
Then you sneeze.
Naturally.
Don't you worry. After all,
I'm taking you for better or for worse.
Do you think you may have to sneeze again?
- I don't know. I can't guarantee it.
- Well, then let's not take any chances.
Why don't you go in the library and rest a while and see how things develop?
Make yourself comfortable.
Read a book.
I think I'd better go back for the encore.
Yes, dear.
- Cousin Henry.
- Yes, Cousin Martha?
You must never do anything like that again.
Is that what you came back here to tell me?
I think it's outrageous.
I hardly know you.
Why, even Albert, my own fiancé, never dared to... -
- Kiss you?
- Of course he kissed me. Why not?
After all, we're engaged.
- But he never kissed me like that.
- Like what?
Oh, I hate you.
I hate you.
I don't even know why
I stay in the same room with you.
Please forgive me, but can't we be friends?
- Just friends?
- Never.
Now, look, we're gonna be related, aren't we?
And we're gonna see each other.
- How can we help it?
- I suppose we can't.
And if we meet in the future we don't have to talk about personal things... - about you and me.
Let's talk about something neutral.
- For instance, Albert.
- Why not?
By the way, do you love Albert?
I'm marrying him, am I not?
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.
No, you're not. You can't.
You haven't got the book.
- What book?
- How to Make Your Husband Happy.
Well, it might interest you to know that I went back and bought it.
Does it tell you how to make a man happy whom you don't love?
Now, look here, Cousin Henry.
Albert's a fine man.
Yes, he is.
He's good, and... - and he has integrity.
- And he's full of high ideals.
- Do you love him?
Well, I'm gonna make him a very fine wife.
At least I'm gonna try my best.
There'll never be a moment in his whole life when he'll ever regret having married me.
And if you ask me one more question, I'm gonna leave this room, and I'll never come back again.
Never!
I still can't understand it.
An angel like you and Albert.
It... - It doesn't make sense.
Why do you want to marry him?
Well, you see,
I always wanted to live in New York.
I don't want to say anything against Kansas... but life on my father's estate... -
Don't misunderstand me. We have all the modern conveniences and luxuries, but... -
Oh, and you don't know
Father and Mother.
Well, I've... - I've only just met them.
- Don't you think they're sweet?
- Well, yes. Very sweet.
Yes, they are. But it's not very easy to live with them.
You see, most of the time they don't talk to one another.
And whenever a young man... - and there were some very nice ones... -
Oh, I'm sure of it.
If one of them asked for my hand and my mother said yes, my father said no.
And when my father said yes, my mother said no.
But Albert came at one of those rare moments when they were both on speaking terms.
And if I hadn't said yes... who knows when my parents might have been talking to each other again?
I might have spent the rest of my life in Kansas.
Don't misunderstand me.
I love Kansas.
It's just that
I don't feel like living there.
Besides that...
I didn't want to be an old maid.
Not in Kansas.
Well, you're going to live right here in New York, and you don't have to marry Albert.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do. You're gonna get married, but not to Albert.
And yet you won't even have to change the initials on your linen.
- You're going to marry me.
- Oh, we can't do that.
How can I marry you?
I'm not even engaged to you.
- Martha, do you love me?
- I hardly know you.
You don't need to know anything when you love.
Love needs no introduction.
You love or you don't.
- You don't know what you're saying.
You must be out of your mind.
- Do you love me or don't you?
Trying to take away the fiancée of your own cousin, causing a family scandal.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
Oh.
Oh, why did you ever come into my life?
To make you happy.
To hold you in my arms forever.
I'll never be able to look my father in the face.
- I'll never be able to go back to Kansas again.
- Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, I wish I were dead.
Look, let's get away. Let's get married immediately.
Right away. Tonight.
- You mean elope?
- That's what I mean.
But where would we go? Oh, I never did such a thing before. I feel so helpless.
I haven't got a thing with me.
Oh, I wish I were dead.
When Romeo and Juliet ran away, they didn't stop to say good-bye.
When Leander swam the Hellespont to his beloved, he didn't bother to take a suitcase.
When Tristan falls in love with Isolde, they have to sing for three and a half hours.
All I'm asking you to do is hop into a cab and drive to the first justice of the peace.
What are we waiting for?
Was that Henry and Martha?
- What happened?
- They left in a cab. They're going to get married.
- Married?
- Married? Married?
Oh, Randolph, where does he get it from?
Now, now, Bertha.
Keep a stiff upper lip.
Sir, I am still too dazed to express myself clearly... but I assure you that the sentiments of our family are with you.
If this happened at home, my husband would jump on a horse and lasso them back.
Don't you tell me what I would do.
But there's one thing I am going to do... - disinherit her.
She'll never see another nickel of mine.
- We came here from Kansas a happy family.
- Well, anyway, a family.
- We loved our Martha.
- Don't mention her name again.
And if she comes crawling back to me on her knees... she'll find the door closed... - and don't you open it.
Please, dear family... thank you, thank you for your efforts to comfort me in my bereavement... but I feel there are others who need even more consolation than I do.
Uncle Randolph and Aunt Bertha... you will have to forget as the years pass by that you are the parents of the guilty party.
And you, Mr. and Mrs. Strable... - well, there's very little
I can say to sustain you.
And to you, Mrs. Cooper-Cooper...
I offer our deepest apology for the unfortunate interruption of your beautiful aria.
I would like to go on, but the strain is too much.
Flogdell.
- Do you know where they were going?
- No, sir.
Flogdell, we've been together for 30 years.
You've never lied to me.
Now tell me.
Do you know where they were going?
- Yes, sir.
- Get your hat and coat.
- Very well, sir.
- Get a cab and tell the driver to go like lightning.
- Very well, sir.
- I think they should have a honeymoon, don't you?
- I think so, sir.
- Then hurry, hurry, hurry!
"She was packed by E.F. Strable...
"to be served at Albert's table... but that Henry changed the label."
That's poetry.
In the next 10 years old houses were torn down.
New houses rose taller and taller.
New York was changing all over.
But our marriage had lasted
just like our two-story gray-stone house.
- Good morning, Flogdell.
- Good morning, sir.
- Oh, you're a new man, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.
- How long have you been here?
- I should say about a year, sir.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Shh! Jackie.
- Good morning, Daddy.
You know very well you're not supposed to bounce that ball until your mother is up.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- I've told you this many times.
And I'm always sorry, Daddy.
Daddy, I'll bet you'd like to know what I'm gonna give you for your birthday.
- I'm dying to know.
- It's something to wear.
- Let's see now. Uh, is it a tie?
- I'm not telling.
I'll give you a hint.
It has 22 colors in it.
No tie can have that many colors, so it can't be a tie.
It can't be, huh?
Now, I'm not saying it is a tie... but if it were a tie, there wouldn't be another one like it in the world.
- I can believe that, Jackie.
- Daddy, how old are you going to be?
- Thirty-six.
- That's pretty old, isn't it?
Uh... - Well, I never thought about it, but I guess it is.
Daddy, when you were as old as me, what kind of a kid were you?
Well, I was very obedient.
When my parents told me to go to bed,
I went without arguing.
I did my schoolwork, brushed my teeth every morning.
Gee, Daddy.
I guess you were a wonderful boy.
Well, I suppose I was.
Then old Grandpa must be a terrible liar.
Well, good-bye, Daddy.
Where does he get it from?
Good morning, Grandfather.
How are you feeling?
- That's fine. Morning, Mother.
- Good morning, Henry.
Mother, I want you to look at this.
- Do you think Martha will like it?
- Oh, it's beautiful.
After 10 years of me, she's entitled to it.
Yes. Ten years next Tuesday.
- And you'll be 36.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, if your dear father could be here and share this happiness with us.
I always thank heaven he lived long enough to see you settle down, become a fine husband... a good father and a wonderful son.
Well, it's all Martha.
And only Martha.
You know, Mother,
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Yes. She's a fine wife, and she has a good influence on you.
And she's pretty lucky herself.
Yes. Don't be a mother-in-law.
By the way, isn't she coming down to breakfast?
I didn't go into her room. The opera lasted till after midnight, so she's probably tired.
Thank you.
- Anything serious?
- No. No. Nothing.
Uh, excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Where is she?
Let me see that telegram.
It's just something personal.
It has nothing to do... -
So, you don't trust me anymore, hmm?
I'm getting too old.
Henry... you mean we've lost Martha?
It's impossible.
It's incredible.
It just doesn't make sense,
Martha leaving me.
What did you do?
What happened?
I don't know how I can go on living without her.
Grandpa, I love Martha.
I love her more than anything in the world.
I didn't ask you that.
I asked you what happened.
I don't know.
I always thought she was very happy with me.
I don't know what she's heard.
You know how people talk about anybody.
No man is perfect.
But running away like this... -
Believe me.
I... - I can't see any reason for it.
If a woman like Martha runs away from her husband, there must be a reason.
Now look here, Henry.
You were the only Van Cleve
I ever really cared about. I loved you.
You were like me... - at least I thought so.
You were all the things
I wanted to be.
You did all the things
I wanted to do and didn't.
- And now you've let me down.
- Grandpa, I can't live without her.
- What... - What am I gonna do?
- That's up to you.
But let me tell you one thing.
I'm an old man.
I might have to go any day now.
And if you can't make Martha forgive you...
I'll be waiting up there right in the entrance.
And if you ever dare to climb up that ladder...
I'll hit you on the head with a baseball bat. jasper!
- Jasper.
- Jasper! jasper. jasper.
- Yes, sir?
- Where are the funny papers?
Uh, boss, well, now, you see... -
- Get 'em, and get 'em right now!
- Yes, sir.
- Good morning, Mrs. Strable.
- Good morning, Jasper.
Uh, it's terrible bad weather we're having today.
You know, when I see it pouring like this...
I often wonder, where does it all come from?
You tell Mr. Strable he'll get the funny papers when I'm through... and not one second sooner.
Yes, ma'am.
I certainly will.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Boss...
I just had a very fine conversation with the missus... and she says if you'd just be good enough to give the matter a little patience... as soon as she finishes
The Katzenjammer Kids I think... -
I came down especially early this morning... to find out if the captain got out of the barrel!
This goes on every Sunday, and I'm not gonna stand it anymore!
- Jasper!
- Excuse me, Mr. Strable.
Yes'm?
You can tell Mr. Strable the captain got out of the barrel.
Boss! Boss!
Got good news for ya!
The captain is out!
Ain't that fine?
- Now you can have a few more cakes.
- Ah, just a couple.
I can't see how he could get out of that barrel.
Why, that barrel had wooden slats... nailed down on the top and the bottom... and there were steel bands all around it... and they left it in the middle of the desert.
Now, how could he ever get out of it?
You eat your cakes while they're nice and hot.
In the meantime,
I'll see what I can find out.
- Uh, another lamb chop, Mrs. Strable?
- I don't mind.
About that barrel, the way he got out of it was, a friendly snake came crawling... -
Don't tell me!
You know it's no fun unless I read it myself!
What are you trying to do, ruin my Sunday?
Will you tell Mr. Strable
I was talking to you? jasper... the snake came crawling along in the desert... wound itself around the barrel, and then, crunch!
I can't live in this house any longer!
- Mr. Strable.
- What do you want, Daisy?
There's a gentleman here to see you say he's from New York.
- His name is Van Cleve.
- Van Cleve?
That's the gentleman's name, yes, sir.
The nerve of him, trying to walk into this house.
- Tell him to go back where he came from.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wait a minute, Daisy.
- Yes, sir?
Maybe I ought to see Mr. Van Cleve.
And if I wanna see him, he'll come in.
And if I want him to stay here, he'll stay right here!
- Now, Daisy...
- Yes, sir? go tell that man if he's not off these premises in 10 seconds, I'll wring his neck!
Yes, sir.
I'll most certainly tell him.
- Jasper, get me some fresh hotcakes.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir, but maybe somethin' done happened to Miss Martha.
- You talk too much.
- Yes, sir.
- Jasper.
- Yes, ma'am?
Tell that man to come in.
Yes, ma'am.
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir!
Mr. Van Cleve, if you please.
How do you do?
Oh! It's the other one!
It's Albert.
Hello, Albert.
- How do you do, Mrs. Strable?
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Strable?
- Well, we haven't seen each other since... -
Not since that ill-fated occasion
10 years ago tomorrow.
- Mmm. Had breakfast?
- Yes, thank you.
- Well, sit down anyway.
- Thank you.
- Got some business in Kansas?
- No, I was on my way to California.
But I said to myself, why shouldn't I stop and pay my respects to those charming Strables?
- Well, what do you want?
- Nothing. Nothing in particular.
- Good.
- Oh, yes!
There is one bit of news.
I'll bet you can't guess whom I met accidentally on the train.
Probably not.
- How's business in New York?
- Very good.
Well, I don't want to keep you in suspense any longer.
I met your own daughter, Martha.
Don't mention her name in this house!
We don't want to hear anything more about her.
My dear friends... speaking as a jurist, may I say that even in our penal code... we have wisely provided a system of parole... and I have excellent reason to believe that the party... - whose name I, naturally, will not mention in this house... - has amply paid for her mistake.
Good.
And I am sure there is nothing she'd like better than to come back to the paternal nest.
So she wants to leave him, and now she remembers us.
Not a chance, Albert.
That's final.
Well, she's waiting in a carriage... in front of this very house.
Who?
Martha?
- Martha? Here?
- Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Strable.
Shall I bring her in?
- Well, I don't know what Mrs. Strable thinks.
- Well, I... -
- And I don't care.
- I don't care what you think.
- She might just as well come in and stay till after the rain's over.
- All right.
Oh, Martha! Martha!
Hello.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello.
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Martha.
- Welcome home, Miss Martha.
- Thank you, Jasper.
- We all missed you.
- Get outta here.
- You talk too much.
- Yes, sir.
Well, I assume there are things between daughter and parents... that are better left to the daughter and to the parents.
If you'll excuse me.
Well, I suppose it was a pretty muddy ride from the station in all that rain.
Yes, I suppose it was.
Uh, do you want some breakfast?
It's Sunday morning.
We got wheat cakes.
Thank you, Father, but I'm not hungry.
Well, the place hasn't changed much, has it?
No, it looks exactly the same.
Maybe now you'll appreciate your home.
It took you 10 years to find out that we were right.
- If you'd listened to your mother... -
- And your father, things might have been different.
- I think I'd better be going.
- Oh, you're getting touchy, huh?
Well, if anyone has a right to be angry, it's us.
But we're willing to let bygones be bygones.
After all, we're not made of stone.
If a daughter comes home and is sorry... -
I'm not sorry, and I don't want your forgiveness.
Then what did you come home for?
I came here because I felt
I wanted to see you.
- If you expect me to get down on my knees... -
- Now, now, now, now, forget it.
After all, you were young, and it probably was all the fault of that... -
Please, Father.
I don't want to hear a single unpleasant word about the last 10 years, or I'll have to go.
Martha.
You look so tired, dear.
- Well, no wonder. After all... -
- Can't you keep still?
It's all dead and buried, and let's forget it.
Come on. Let's go upstairs.
You're going to have a nice, hot bath, and then you're going to lie down and rest.
Now, how's that? Huh?
So he really got out of that barrel.
Well, what do you think of that?
Jasper! jasper!
What's all that noise about? just had a talk with Mr. Chuck.
He say somebody said they saw a couple of prowlers on the grounds.
- Maybe some of them horse thieves.
- Well, tell Chuck to keep after 'em.
- Yes, sir.
- If necessary, shoot 'em.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Father, but if you don't mind,
I think I'll go upstairs.
I'm getting pretty tired.
Good night.
- Good night, Martha.
- Good night, Mother.
Good night, dear.
Remember, breakfast at 7:30.
Yes, Mother.
Good night, Albert.
Good night, Martha.
Martha?
Well, Martha, I want you to have a restful night.
And why not?
Your troubles are actually over.
- I suppose you're right.
- I know I am.
You paid for your mistakes, and paid dearly.
Now, I don't want anybody to get the impression that I've been the victim of 10 years of misery.
Nothing of the kind.
On the contrary, I can say there were moments in my marriage... which few women have been lucky enough to have experienced.
- There were times when you were lifted way up to the sky...
- Yes, way up. only to be dropped way down afterward.
That's not the purpose of marriage.
Marriage isn't a series of thrills.
Marriage is a peaceful, well-balanced adjustment of two right-thinking people.
I'm afraid that's only too true.
Well, good night, Albert.
Uh, Martha, there's... one other thought
I want you to sleep with.
My feelings for you have remained unchanged.
That's very kind of you, Albert, and I'm touched.
Naturally, I'm not the flashy type, like some people.
I'd say I was rather on the conservative side.
If I were, for instance, a suit of clothes, you wouldn't call me a stylish cut.
And I prefer it that way.
But I can safely say
I'm made of solid material.
I'm sewed together carefully and my lining is good, Martha.
Frankly, I believe I wear well.
I'm... not too hot in the summer... and I give protection in the winter.
- Need I say more?
- No, Albert.
You've given a complete and accurate description of yourself.
- Good night.
- Thank you, Martha.
- Miss Martha?
- Yes?
Excuse me.
That horse thief we were looking for... -
- Did you catch him?
- Yes, ma'am.
- He's in your room waiting for you.
- In my r... -
- You mean... -
- Yes, miss. That's him.
Martha, darling, sweetheart... -
How could you do a thing like this to me?
Don't you realize what I went through?
- Oh, Henry... -
- Running away like that without a word!
Can't you imagine how I suffered?
How could you do this to me?
Oh, Martha, Martha.
Henry, it won't work anymore.
- What's Albert doing here?
- I met him by accident on the train.
- He was very nice to me, and... -
- Accident? You expect me to believe that?
Here I am, looking all over the world for my wife, going insane with despair.
And where do I find her? 2,000 miles away in a lonely country place with another man.
- I don't see how I can stand any more.
- Henry, it won't work.
Very well.
If it comes to the point where a woman doubts her husband's sincerity... there's nothing more to do.
Everything is over.
Good-bye, Martha.
Good-bye, Henry.
Martha, I really mean this.
I'm going.
I know you mean it, Henry.
All right. just give me five minutes to pull myself together, and you'll never see me again. Never, never.
Oh, Henry, I know your every move.
I know your outraged indignation.
I know the poor, weeping little boy.
I know the misunderstood, strong, silent man... the wounded lion who's too proud to explain what happened in the jungle last night.
So, I'm a fake.
- I'm false, I'm cheap.
- Oh, Henry, please... -
- I know I've brought you nothing but unhappiness.
- You know that's not true.
- Oh! So we had some good times together.
- Some wonderful times.
Then what do you want? What did I do?
Even a murderer has a right to defend himself.
You can't hang a man without evidence.
- I know.
If I only knew what particular thing is in your mi... -
- Have you seen Aunt Minetta recently?
- Yes, of course.
Oh, well, now everything is clear.
This is something I didn't even want to mention to you, it's so unimportant.
When she saw me, yes,
I was at the Plaza having tea... and at the table with me was a very handsome young woman, but there was nothing to it.
- I would have explained to you myself... -
- But you didn't want to make me uncomfortable.
- Even for one second.
- That's right, darling. That's exactly right.
Henry, it won't work. And besides,
Aunt Minetta didn't say one word about you.
- And as for the young lady at the Plaza... -
- Darling, I can easily explain that.
Oh, I know you can.
You're a master at that.
All right, all right.
I'm fighting a losing battle.
I don't love you. I never loved you.
I love everybody in New York more than you.
There you go again.
It's the 25th of October.
Many happy returns.
Thank you, Martha... but it's something much more important than my birthday.
It's our anniversary.
Ten years ago today, I was almost as much in love with you as I am right now.
It's very difficult for a woman to send her husband away on their 10th anniversary... especially when he speaks as beautifully as you do.
But I must do it.
All right, darling.
I know it's all over.
I'm sure you'll find someone else who will be... really worthy of you.
But let's pretend... just for a minute.
Happy anniversary.
Do you like it?
I'd say it cost at least $10,000.
For that money, it's a very good purchase.
Why, Martha, how can you talk like that?
If you'd only forgotten to give me this bracelet...
I probably would have been foolish enough to be in your arms right now.
You've no idea what a mistake you made.
The magician played one trick too many.
The other day I was having a new photograph made ofJackie and me.
I wanted to have it the right size to fit into your wallet.
So I slipped into your room.
This fell out of your wallet.
And I don't ever remember having received any bracelet from you on or about May 2.
Oh, so that's what it's all about.
And to think that you went through all this just because the jeweler made a mistake.
And that what the whole thing is... - a mistake.
Naturally, I didn't buy a bracelet for $500.
Has Cartier ever made a mistake in any of our bills before?
Darling, I love you. I think you're the most beautiful, adorable thing in all the world.
Do you really believe there's any woman good enough to take me away from you?
And if there were such a woman, do you think she'd be worth only a $500 bracelet?
- Henry, I... -
- Darling, I'll make you a bet.
If Cartier doesn't admit that this whole thing is a terrible mistake... -
- Then you won't buy there anymore.
- Henry, it won't work.
- Grandpa!
- Martha, my darling.
Come on, come on.
Let's get started. Let's pack.
- Grandpa, what do you mean?
- Naturally, you're going back with us to New York.
What are you standing there for?
You're making a pretty bad job of it.
Come on, sweep her off her feet, or we'll miss the next train.
- If I can't make her happy, then I don't want her to come back.
- Yeah, that's better.
- No, I mean this seriously.
- That's why it's good.
Look, Martha, let's face it.
- You want a divorce.
- I see no other way.
- What aboutJackie?
- Naturally, I want him.
I think you're right.
I think he should get away from me.
- I didn't mean it that way.
- But I did.
I adore the boy, and therefore
I think he shouldn't be with me.
Well, I don't think a child should be deprived of his father.
Do you want him to grow up to be another Henry Van Cleve... and on his 36th birthday make his wife as unhappy as I've made you?
- Are the rest of your things in the closet?
- Yes.
For instance, do you know what our littleJackie did the other day?
- What?
- He bought some ice cream for a little girl.
What's wrong about that?
I think it's charming.
But the girl he bought the ice cream for was not the girl he should have bought it for.
- It wasn't?
- No.
Little devil.
And when the one little girl found out that the other girl... -
Well, that boy got himself into such a mess.
Oh, if I only could have been there.
You should have seen our littleJackie trying to get himself out of that situation.
- Did he?
- Yes.
Little girl likes him better than before.
Good. What a child.
- Believe me, he is a problem.
- I suppose so.
But when he makes up his little stories... -
And you know they're just little stories, but he wants you to believe them so badly... that you wish you could... and finally what can you do but... -
Happy anniversary.
I'm still too confused.
I've got to collect myself.
- Give her time to make up her mind.
- She can do that on the train.
- But what am I going to say to my parents?
- Send 'em a telegram.
- Sneak out of the house in the middle of the night?
- Exactly.
- Like burglars?
- Like thieves.
- We did it once before.
- Why shouldn't we do it again?
- How many people are lucky enough to have the thrill of eloping twice in one marriage?
- That's it! That's it!
- How many women love their husbands enough to forgive them and start all over again?
- Good! Good!
And how many men love their wives enough to lie and say they're guilty when they've done nothing?
- Careful, Henry, careful.
- At least nothing that amounts to very much.
I wouldn't go any further into that.
We'd better get started.
I'll see if the coast is clear.
- Jasper. Jasper?
- Yes?
- Everything ready?
- Yes, sir. Right out in front.
All my life I've wanted to run away with a woman.
- Jasper, it's happening!
- Thank you, sir.
All right, come on.
- Bye, Jasper.
- Good-bye, Miss Martha. Good-bye.
Albert!
Come!
And so, farewell, dear E.F. Strable!
We'll take Martha!
You keep Mabel!
Yippee!
Then one birthday began following another...
faster and faster.
Each year there were
more and more candles...
and less and less... -
Yes, I became 45.
Then came 46...
47...
and I stopped counting.
On one of these birthdays...
Martha and I, just the two of us,
went to the Follies.
§ I'm the sheikh §
§ Of Araby §
§ Yes, indeed, he's the sheikh of Araby §
§ Your love belongs to me §
§ We're in love
We're in love, as you can see §
§ At night, when you're asleep §
§ Late at night when the moon is shining bright §
§ Into your tent I'll creep §
§ I'll be creepin' when we are asleep §
§ The stars that shine above §
§ Way up high in the sky up above §
§ Will light our way to love §
§ Will light our way to love §
§ You'll rule this land with me §
§ Oh, how happy we will always be §
§ The sheikh of Araby §§
Suddenly I noticed...
a very attractive girl
coming down the staircase.
To me she was
just another attractive girl...
but, I must admit, attractive.
Anyway, a few weeks later...
I happened to find out
that her name was Peggy Nash...
and I happened to hear things about her
which made me very eager to meet Miss Nash.
- Yes?
- A Mr. Jones to see you.
I'll be out in a minute.
- Will you come in, please, Mr. Jones?
- Thank you.
- Miss Nash will be with you in just a minute.
- Thank you.
- How do you do, Mr. Jones?
- How do you do, Miss Nash?
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Thank you so much for those beautiful, beautiful roses.
When I saw you the other evening at the Follies coming down that stairway, I said to myself... -
"That's the girl of my dreams"?
Uh, that's right.
- You see, Miss Nash... -
- Call me Peggy.
Well, this is delightful.
- Hello, Peggy.
- Hello, Jonesy.
Well, Jonesy, let me tell you, that note that came with your flowers... -
- You liked it?
- Who wouldn't?
It was so full of charm.
It was so sweet.
It had all the quaintness of bygone days.
Really?
Yes. You know, men don't write that way anymore.
Why are there so few of you left?
Miss Nash, to tell you the truth...
I didn't exactly come up here to be admired as a museum piece.
Now, Jonesy, don't be touchy.
- Yeah. Anyway, Miss Nash... -
- Peggy.
Anyway, Peggy...
I'm sure it's a waste of time to talk of the past... when the present can be so lovely that one anticipates a most delightful future.
Oh, thank you, Jonesy.
What a difference.
You know, the moment you meet somebody of today he says...
"How about it, babe?
Where do we have supper?"
The next moment, he pulls out a diamond bracelet.
And before you know it there it is on your wrist.
How crude. How crude.
Yes, very crude.
And let me tell you... a bracelet hastily presented... is usually selected hastily... whereas a bracelet chosen with care... -
- Has better stones?
- The very best.
Oh, Jonesy, Jonesy, you make it all sound so wonderful.
- But how could I explain such a gift to... -
- To whom?
Oh. Friend of yours?
Very much so.
- Serious?
- I'm afraid it is.
Is there anything I could do to make you forget this young man? jonesy, you're asking a lot. just look at him.
- He seems very young.
- Not too young.
Would it be indiscreet of me to ask who this young man is?
Come on, Mr. Van Cleve.
Don't you know your own son?
No, I didn't fall into your trap.
You know, Mr. Van Cleve, girls are awfully smart these days.
It must be rather sad for the great cavalier of the gay '90s... to find his technique is getting rusty.
Yes, I've heard all about the daring Henry.
I understand in my mother's day you were.
And I'm sure you had a very dashing figure.
And now you're a kind of, um... retired Casanova.
You know, it's always the same with men when they retire.
Some grow flowers, and, uh... some grow a tummy.
Miss Nash, my son means very much to me.
- He means very much to me too.
- How much?
Oh, yes, that's right.
Of course.
In your day girls used to wait... for the old-fashioned father to come with the big checkbook to pay off.
I'm sure that happened.
Well, that's one thing that hasn't changed.
Shall we say... 5,000?
Five thousand?
Oh, Jonesy, you underestimate me.
I'm much worse than that.
To get rid of somebody as terrible as me is worth... -
Well, I'll make you a bargain... -
All right.
I'll send you the money.
- Before lunch?
- Before lunch.
Good-bye, Miss Nash.
- You've been perfectly charming.
- And so have you.
- And you hope never to see me again.
- I wouldn't say that.
Miss Nash, now that our problem has been solved...
I would like to ask one slight question.
Not that it matters, but I'm just curious and I would appreciate an honest answer.
I give you my word.
Suppose you didn't know I was Jack's father and you happened to see me on the street... or in a restaurant.
This is just an academic question.
How old would you say I am?
Well, I'd say about 50.
- That old?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Oh, no, no. That's perfectly all right.
- Thanks very much.
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
Fifty.
No wonder you get those headaches.
Thank you, darling.
Martha, this is going to be a bit unpleasant.
I've tried to keep it from you for some time, but now I think I'd better tell you.
I know.
You don't love me anymore.
Now, darling, don't try to be funny.
It's aboutJack.
Will you please stop worrying aboutJack?
If he wants to stay out late, what of it?
If he's ever going to have any fun, now's the time. Don't spoil it.
Martha, this is serious.
Very, very serious.
I just happened to learn the boy got into the clutches of a certain girl.
I went to a great deal of trouble... -
Believe me, it wasn't easy... - but I managed to find out who the girl was.
- You mean Peggy Nash?
- Ye... -
Where did you... -
How did you know?
Oh, I forget.
Someone told me.
You go to lunch, and you hear things.
Why didn't you tell me? How can you be so placid about a thing like this?
Darling, why should I excite you?
I know you so well. Certain little things get you all worked up, and then you don't sleep.
Then you have to take a pill, and then you don't want to take a pill.
Believe me, Henry, the less attention you pay to them... -
Really, these things work themselves out.
Oh, Martha, Martha.
That is one of your greatest charms.
After almost 25 years in New York, you're still the innocent little girl from Kansas.
But, fortunately,
I have had experience with showgirls.
And it's a father's function to save his son from the mistakes he made.
If we ignore matters like this, how do you think our boy will end up? just like you... - with a girl like me.
No, darling, never.
Where would he find anybody like you?
He couldn't.
He won't be that lucky.
- Aren't you sweet.
- I have no illusions about myself.
Martha, if I hadn't met you
I hate to think where I'd be right now.
Well, probably outside some stage door... or even inside the dressing room... and having a wonderful time.
- Oh, now, darling... -
- Come on. Give me a kiss.
Don't let's worry about it anymore.
Martha, I just want to get your viewpoint.
Do you think it would be a bad idea, just to be safe, if I looked up this girl and, uh... -
And what?
Well, maybe, just to avoid complications... ask her to leave the boy alone and, if necessary, buy her off.
Now, Henry, don't even consider anything as foolish as that.
All right, all right, all right.
It was just a thought.
- If you want me to, I'll drop it.
- Good.
How much did you pay the girl?
Why, what do you mean?
Don't I know my Henry and his innocent eyes?
I beg your pardon, sir, but you've told me to let you know when Mr. Jack arrived, sir.
- He's just come in, sir.
- Thank you.
Mmm.
You see? He's home early for the first time in weeks, and I'll tell you why.
He went to the theater as usual, and she gave him his walking papers.
- And the poor boy is probably all upset.
- I hope he is.
And, Martha, don't you baby him.
Don't you spoil what I've done.
- Hello.
- Hello, Jack.
Hello, Mother.
Hello, Father.
- How are you, Jack?
- Fine.
- You look a little depressed.
- Who, me? I never felt better in all my life.
Besides that, I could use $100.
A hundred dollars?
What for?
Well, I wanna throw a little party tonight, take someone out.
Oh. I see.
Tell me, whom are you going around with these days, Jack?
Now, Martha, that's Jack's personal life and we shouldn't pry into it.
Here you are, Jack.
There's your hundred dollars.
- Thanks, Father.
- Have a good time.
- Thanks.
- I'm not interested in whom you're taking out.
I'm sure she's all right.
Anyway, it's none of our business whether you're taking out MaryJones...
Helen Smith, Mitzi Glutz... or Peggy Nash.
Peggy Nash?
Father, what is this? Are you trailing me?
Where'd you hear that name?
I don't know.
Martha, where did we hear that name?
I don't know.
And don't ask me.
Well, uh, uh, one has friends... and, yes, one goes to lunch an... -
Tell me, isn't she a Follies girl famous for coming down a staircase?
- Look, we're all grown up, aren't we?
- Why, certainly.
- Well, I had a crush on her.
- Ah, and why not?
- Why shouldn't he?
- I don't know. And don't ask me.
I, uh... - I understand she's a very attractive girl.
Oh, she is, and I took her pretty seriously.
- Oh, you did, huh?
- Yes, very.
- And then after a little time...
- Yes?
- I got tired of her.
- Oh.
Oh, you did, huh?
So then I faced the problem of how to get rid of her.
- Things like that aren't easy.
- I should say not.
- Don't ask me.
- I didn't ask you. I merely made a statement.
- Go on, Jack.
- After all, what could she do to me?
I hadn't promised her anything.
- You hadn't?
- I should say not.
I wasn't the first romance in her life.
You know, I'm no baby.
But nevertheless, you went there expecting a lot of trouble, didn't you?
Yes, but to my surprise, she was so big about the whole thing... and let me off so easily.
Oh, she did, eh?
Well, isn't that fortunate.
Yes.
She was so wonderful about the whole thing,
I almost fell in love with her again.
Y... - Oh.
Oh, but it's all over now, and I'm glad of it.
- And so am I.
- And so am I.
As a matter of fact,
I never was happier in my life.
And while we're on the subject, Jack,
I think you're getting to the age... where you should start to look around for a really nice girl.
Oh, I don't have to look around.
I've met her already.
- You have?
- A wonderful girl.
- The most wonderful girl I ever met in my life.
- Really! Well, isn't that nice.
Tell me, who is the young lady?
Is she someone I might know?
A New York girl, perhaps?
Oh, no.
She comes from Philadelphia.
Oh! From Philadelphia.
Somehow Philadelphia always sounds right, doesn't it, Martha?
- Yes, it does. Tell us who she is.
- Yes, tell us.
Well, have you been to
Earl Carroll's Vanities?
You mean this girl comes down a staircase too?
I should say not.
Not this girl.
This one slides down the bannister, falls in the orchestra... and lands... - bang... - right on the big drum.
Oh, you'll be crazy about her.
See you tomorrow.
I have to run along.
What's the matter with that boy?
He's young, Henry.
That's all.
Come on, dear.
It's time to go to bed.
Martha, I want to ask you something.
And don't spare my feelings.
Be absolutely frank.
I always am.
If you didn't know me and you saw me for the first time... on the street or in a restaurant... -
Martha, do you think
I'm getting a little heavy?
Don't let that worry you.
As a matter of fact, I like it.
Let me tell you something.
Nearly 15 years ago, when you and Grandfather brought me back from Kansas...
I still didn't feel that you really belonged to me, and only to me.
I can't put my finger on anything definite... but still, whenever I wasn't with you
I was always a little uncertain... and nervous about my little Casanova.
And then... one day I noticed that you began to have a little... -
Well, just a little tummy.
Then I knew I was safe.
From that moment on I knew that you were really mine, that you'd settle down.
Now go to bed, darling.
You've had a hard day.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
Yes, we were married 25 years.
We were celebrating
our silver wedding anniversary.
- Have you seen Mrs. Van Cleve?
- No, sir. I've been in the kitchen.
- Jack, is your mother upstairs?
- No. I haven't seen her.
Darling.
What are you doing in here all alone?
Nothing.
I just want to take a little rest.
- After all, it's been such an exciting evening.
- Nothing wrong, is there?
- No, nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, dear.
- You're feeling all right, aren't you?
- Of course, darling. I'm just... -
- Just what?
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was being a little sentimental... so I came in here for a few minutes.
Ah.
Yes.
This is where it all started.
Twenty-five years ago.
I was... -
Yes, I was standing over there by that desk.
No, you were sitting in a chair.
Yes. You're right.
And then you came in and you stood by the desk.
Then suddenly you started walking toward me... very slowly, very slowly.
I could count every step.
Oh, you were such a frightened little girl.
The closer I came, the more frightened you were.
Darling, I want to make a confession.
- After all, we've been married 25 years.
- What is it?
I wasn't frightened at all.
- You weren't?
- Not at all.
And when you were walking toward me so very slowly, do you know what was in my mind?
- No.
- I thought, What's the matter with him?
Can't he walk faster?
- And then I ran out into the hall.
- But you came back.
- Only because I had to sneeze.
- Mm-hmm.
I beg your pardon, madam.
You are wanted on the telephone.
Oh.
Hello?
Yes, I called you.
Well, it's really not important.
Yes, everything is all right now.
I'll call you soon.
All right, tomorrow.
- Who was that?
- Oh, nothing special.
- Let's go back to our guests, shall we?
- Darling, who was that on the phone?
- I'll tell you all about it some other time.
- Why not now?
- Our guests will be wondering where we are.
- Now, Martha, who was that?
All right, I'll tell you.
It's another confession.
- My lover.
- I don't think that's funny at all.
- Are you jealous?
- Oh, don't be silly, Martha.
But why can't you tell your husband whom you talk to over the telephone?
Besides, I wouldn't have brought it up right now, but just the same... for the past several weeks you've been going out in the afternoons... and you've always managed to avoid telling me where you were.
You are jealous!
Henry, at last, after 25 years!
- Thank you, darling.
- Martha, whom did you talk to?
Darling, don't be a baby. What dashing young cavalier would be pursuing me?
Plenty. You're still very attractive, and... - and you know it.
Henry...
I don't think you realize how sweet you're being at this moment.
No husband could have said anything lovelier to his wife on their 25th anniversary.
Imagine if, 25 years ago,
I hadn't sneezed.
I wouldn't be the happiest woman in the world right now.
- Are you?
- Yes, Henry.
- Now, who was it?
- I'll tell you tomorrow.
I am not going to leave this room until you tell me.
Well, knowing my obstinate little boy... -
You promise to be sensible and not make a mountain out of a molehill?
- I promise. Now... -
- Well, you know how women are.
We have too much time on our hands, and we begin to imagine there are things wrong with us.
And I'm no exception, so I've been going to a doctor, that's all.
Darling, I feel like a fool.
Now I have a confession I must make to you... -
I really was jealous.
Martha. What did you go to the doctor for?
What's wrong?
- Nothing, really.
- So that's why you came in this room.
- You weren't feeling well. Darling, is it serious?
- I tell you, it's nothing at all.
- Just a little dizzy spell.
- Darling... -
Now, you promised to be sensible.
Come on, let's dance.
Martha, what did the doctor say?
Listen, dear, if I take five drops three times a day... and if you don't worry about me too much... we'll both live to celebrate our golden anniversary.
Now, come on. Let's dance.
I didn't know it then...
but this was our last anniversary.
It was the last time we danced together.
There were only a few more months
left for Martha...
and she made them the happiest
of our lives together.
Sixty. Yes, I was 60.
Jack insisted on celebrating.
And here are my relatives
who came to make this birthday...
an occasion of riotous gaiety.
Cousin William... - 73.
Aunt Minnie,
who admitted to 81.
The total age
of this scintillating assemblage...
was over 1,400 years.
I believeJack gave this party
on purpose...
to remind me that I was contributing
60 years to that 1,400.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ralston.
- Is Mr. Van Cleve down yet?
- He's having his breakfast.
Oh. Thank you.
- Good morning, Mr. Van Cleve.
- Good morning, Miss Ralston.
Sorry to get you up so early, but I want these two letters to leave on the 9:30 plane.
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.
When you get back to the office, please see that I get a complete domestic report... from every department before noon because I may go to Chicago.
Very well.
Now, uh, there's just one little thing.
It's, uh... - Well, a letter came in from your father addressed to the board of directors, and... -
Is he trying to go over my head again?
- Oh, I'm sure he didn't mean it that way.
- What does he want?
We live together in the same house, and then he writes letters to the board of directors.
What's the old gentleman trying to put over this time?
He wants the board of directors to vote him a bonus.
- A bonus?
- He talked to me yesterday, confidentially.
In case that bonus doesn't go through... he wanted me to persuade you to give him at least an advance on his monthly check.
He shouldn't go to you, Miss Ralston.
Well, I'm gonna give him a lesson.
And, Miss Ralston, if my father
ever talks to you again...
tell him he ought to be ashamed and that
you are in no position to deliver any messages.
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.
- Why, Mr. Van Cleve... -
- Shh!
- Is he in a bad mood?
- Terrible.
Now, look here, Miss Ralston, would you do me a very great favor?
- Father!
- Ohh.
- Good morning, Jack.
- Good morning.
I'd like to talk to you.
Father.
I heard a very funny story. You'll love it.
It'll start your day off with a laugh.
You ought to be ashamed, coming home at all hours, making a wreck of yourself.
How much longer do you think you can keep this up?
- Please, Jack, don't scold me.
- Someday you're gonna collapse.
- Do I look that bad?
- You look like a ghost.
I know you're right, Jack.
I know I should change my way of living.
But, my boy, put yourself in my position.
I'm lonesome.
You're always away somewhere on business.
Being alone in this big house night after night, you don't know what it's like.
Neither do you because you're never at home.
But I can imagine what it's like, and, Jack, it's horrible.
Now, my boy, I want to talk to you.
I'm not fooling myself.
I'm not getting any younger.
I think the time has come for me to change my way of living.
You know, Jack, when a man gets to be... - gets to be 60... the blood doesn't flow as fast anymore.
Instead of a wild mountain stream, it becomes a quiet little brook.
The other day, when I was sitting here all alone, you know what I felt like doing?
- What?
- I felt like I wanted to sit... in a nice, comfortable chair... and read and read and read.
Well, why didn't you? The library is full of books, and I'm sure you haven't read one of them. jack, the eyes can't take it anymore.
Why don't you go to an oculist?
Uh, yes... that might do.
Yes, that might do.
But, uh... on the other hand... what do you think of the idea of having, well, some kind of reader?
You know, someone with a pleasant voice, nice diction.
I know just what you want. You mean one of those nice, quiet fellows from Yale or Harvard.
Oh, they're easy to get.
- Now, who is she?
- Jack, you have the most suspicious mind.
Come on.
How old is she?
Well, uh, she's an unusually adult young woman.
I met her at old Wilson Weatherby's.
She was his reader.
Hmm. The whole thing sounds a little fishy to me.
Now, Jack, why do you want to deprive your old father of a little cultural pleasure?
I can think of nothing more dignified and homelike... than sitting in front of a fireplace and having someone read a fine book to me.
Something worthwhile.
Something... -
Father, her last thought was that you should be happy.
I promised her I'd see to it.
So, if you want this young lady to read to you, go ahead with my blessing.
No, I couldn't do it.
When a man gets to be 60, his life... -
Isn't over, Father.
Doesn't have to be over.
If a man is lonely and he feels that he needs, well... -
You mean, the feminine touch?
That's natural.
But I think he should find someone closer to his own age.
Maybe.
Not a girl of, uh... -
Twenty-four.
Well, that is a little out of proportion.
I'm afraid so.
But if, on the other hand, he should meet a cultured woman of... -
Right.
Someone with real dignity?
A woman of about 50 or 51.
Or 52 or 53, or even 55.
That's more like it. jack, my future looks pretty depressing.
Mr. Van Cleve, you're wanted on the telephone, sir.
Hello.
What?
Oh, uh, just a moment.
It's for you, "poochie."
As a man grows older,
his medicine cabinet grows bigger.
This is me at 70.
Now, really, there's nothing to worry about.
But, Mrs. Van Cleve, please... -
I know, but it was his 70th birthday yesterday... and I didn't have the heart to keep him from celebrating a little.
I hate to go to that banquet and leave the old man alone.
- I'd just as soon stay home.
- No, it's perfectly all right for you to go.
In fact, the fewer people around him, the better off he'll be.
Now, Mr. Van Cleve, I'm sorry to wake you up, but it has to be done.
Oh, if I could just... -
- Now, open your mouth, please.
- Oh, go away. Go away and leave me alone.
What was that dream all about?
Oh, I was having such a good time.
- Just open your mouth.
- What was that all about?
Oh, yes.
The door opened and a man stepped out of a rowboat.
He said, "Henry...
I've come to take you on a trip from which you'll never come back."
Now, please, don't get excited.
And I said, "My good fellow...
"if I ever take a trip like that, it'll be in a deluxe cabin... and not in a dinky little rowboat that doesn't even have a bar."
So I threw him out, rowboat and all.
Good. Good.
And what do you think he did?
He came back with a big luxury liner... floating on an ocean of whiskey and soda.
And instead of funnels... there were big, black cigars.
And on top of the bar, sitting in a lifeboat... was the most beautiful blonde... wearing a Merry Widow costume.
She dived into the whiskey and swam right over to my bedside.
"Henry," she said...
"how about a little dance?"
And the man from the boat took an accordion out of his pocket... and he played...
"The Merry Widow Waltz."
The girl held her arms out to me... and she started to dance.
Well... with him playing and her dancing... and me up to my neck in whiskey anyhow... well, I put my arms around that beautiful girl... and was just about to dance with her... when, of all people, you cut in.
You. Yes, you.
- Just open your mouth.
- Go away, and take that thermometer with you.
- The night nurse has just arrived.
- All right.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
- First door to the right.
- Thank you.
I'd fallen asleep... and suddenly I was awakened by a caressing touch on my forehead.
I opened my eyes and there she was, sitting right on the edge of the bed.
Nellie Brown, Registered Nurse.
Your Excellency... one look at her and it didn't matter whether she was registered or not.
Then she took out a thermometer... and she said, "Open your mouth."
Who wouldn't for Nellie?
And then she put the thermometer in... and my temperature went up to 110.
Who could ask for a more beautiful death?
Your Excellency, that's the story of my life... and I'd be grateful if you'd push the button and have it over with.
No.
Definitely no.
I hope you will not consider me inhospitable if I say... sorry, Mr. Van Cleve, but we don't cater to your class of people here.
Please make your reservation somewhere else.
Somewhere else?
But, Your Excellency, if I walk into the lobby of the other place... -
You mean, above?
Yes.
I know what will happen.
They might not even let me register.
The doorman might not even let me in.
Well, you never can tell.
It's worth trying.
Sometimes they have a small room vacant in the annex.
Not exactly on the sunny side... and not so very comfortable.
The bed may be hard... and you might have to wait a few hundred years until they move you into the main building.
Well, it doesn't hurt to try.
After all, they may inquire about you among the residents in the main building.
I think you'll find a lot of people who will give you a good reference, and that always helps.
For instance, there were... several young ladies.
- What about them?
- Well, some of them might be there.
And so far as I can see, you've made them all very happy.
Oh.
I'm sure they'd like to see you happy too.
And your grandfather.
Oh, yes. Grandfather.
Don't you think he'll be waiting for you?
- He might.
- He will.
- And not with a baseball bat.
- Hmm.
And if they all should fail, there's still someone else.
Yes.
She's up there.
And she will plead for you.
Do you think so?
You know she will.
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve...
I would say you have a chance... - a very good chance.
Anyway, it's worth trying.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Your Excellency.
- And thank you.
- Good luck.
I'll need it.
Down?
No.
Up.
Lawrence Stewart Talbot, who died at the youthful age of 31.
R.I.P.
That's it.
Give me the chisel.
Suppose they didn't bury him with the money on him.
Everybody in the village knows about it... his gold watch and ring and money in his pockets.
It's a sin to bury good money when it could help people.
This gives me the creeps.
What do you think it will look like after so many years?
Just bones and an empty skull.
Watch the lamp.
Get me the light.
Wolfbane.
Wolfbane?
Yes.
Even a man who is pure at heart... and says his prayers by night... may become a wolf... when the wolfbane blooms... and the moon is full and bright.
It looks like he's asleep.
Let's get on with it.
First the ring.
We won't have to worry for a long time. I thought the dead was stiff.
Shut up.
Gold.
It's holding me.
Help me.
Help me.
Alive.
Help, help!
Don't leave me!
Here, now.
Come up.
Come on. Wake up and get along with you.
You've got a home, haven't you?
Or do you want me to take you to the station?
Good heavens!
How is the patient, Nurse?
He's conscious, Dr. Mannering.
And talked. He insists upon sitting up.
Conscious? Talked?
But that's impossible so soon after a critical operation.
The nurse tells me you're well enough to talk.
Why, yes.
Pulse, 72, no fever.
There's no pain?
No.
Where am I?
Queen's Hospital.
Queens? Yes, Queen's
Hospital in Cardiff.
Wh...
How did I get here?
You were found in the street more dead than alive with a head injury.
How did you get that skull fracture?
I... don't remember.
This is Inspector Owen.
I'm Dr. Mannering.
What's your name?
Lawrence Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot.
Where did you come from?
Llanwelly Village.
But... how did I get to Cardiff?
That's enough for now.
You must rest.
You'll be fit again very soon.
If there's any change, call me immediately.
Yes, Doctor.
Hello? Put me through to the police station at Llanwelly.
Just a routine checkup, Doctor.
Then we can close the case.
Llanwelly Police Station.
This is Inspector Owen speaking, from Cardiff.
Have you got anything in your file on a man named...
Lawrence Talbot?
Why, of course.
He lived here.
Good. That's all right, then. We've got him up here in our hospital.
Huh. I wouldn't want him in our hospital.
He died four years ago.
Why, of course I'm sure,
Inspector.
I was present at his funeral.
That'll be all,
Inspector. Good-bye.
Lawrence Talbot died four years ago. Your man's an impostor.
That's a harsh word, Inspector.
Poor devil of unsound mind.
I'll wager he's sound enough to remember his own name.
I'm gonna have another talk with him.
Inspector.
Yeah?
That man is my patient, not your prisoner.
I'll decide when he can be questioned again.
Very well.
It's in your hands.
I found this bandage here when I came in this morning.
I didn't open the window.
The patient must've done it himself.
You'd better cover him up.
You're all right.
Nothing has happened.
Better get some more bandages.
We'll renew the compress.
Now, don't excite yourself.
Please be calm.
Doctor... something terrible has happened.
You must've had a nightmare. It's evident you were walking in your sleep.
Call the police.
The police? Yes, you'd better call them.
I'm a...
I'm a murderer.
Yes, of course.
Anything you say.
Ask Inspector Owen to come here at once. Yes, Doctor.
What is all this about wanting the police?
Last night, I...
I killed someone.
But you were in this room all night.
I tell you, I did it.
I killed someone.
But you couldn't have.
You must've heard the nurses discussing it.
Mr. Talbot, you're suffering from a delusion.
It's true someone was killed last night, but it happened many streets from here.
Moreover, he was attacked by some sort of wild animal.
That's just it.
I turn into an animal.
Well, Mr. Talbot.
Decided to remember your real name?
Mr. Talbot seems to have heard about the unfortunate constable last night.
It's disturbing him. But he doesn't understand.
There's a curse upon me.
I change into a wolf.
It's a bit difficult to believe, my good man.
See that scar?
That's where I was bitten by a wolf.
Only it wasn't a real wolf.
It was a man.
A werewolf.
I killed him.
Now I change into a wolf at night when the moon is full.
Hmph.
It's the truth.
Ask Maleva, the old
Gypsy woman. She knows.
Maleva? Gypsy?
Hmph.
Mr. Talbot, you must get back into bed.
Oh, are you blind? Won't you believe me? Help me.
Just tell us your real name.
Let us do the worrying.
I told you.
Lawrence Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot!
Why can't you understand?
Lawrence Talbot died four years ago.
Died?
Four years?
Well, I did...
Ohh.
I can't die.
Mr. Talbot, if you want us to help you, you must do as we say.
Now, please lie down.
You think I'm insane.
You think I don't know what I'm talking about.
Well, you just look inside that grave where
Lawrence Talbot is supposed to be buried, and see if you find a body in it.
Please get back into bed. Get on with it.
You're treating me like a lunatic.
Well, you're as stupid as all the rest.
Come along, Inspector.
You mean to say that Talbot actually experienced that murder last night?
I'm afraid so.
People with brain injuries sometimes develop supernormal mental powers... that are quite extraordinary.
Certainly he got up and opened the window.
The borderline between delusion and reality is very narrow.
Sometimes a patient may unknowingly overstep that line.
Then that man's dangerous.
He ought to be behind bars.
He's a lycanthrope.
A what?
Lycanthrope.
Oh.
What's that?
A man who imagines himself to be a wolf.
Oh.
Poor devil.
We should try to do something to help him.
Well, Doctor, I think I'll run up to Llanwelly and find out...
You know, Inspector,
I had the very same idea.
To be able to cure this man,
I have to know who he is.
Right.
We'll go up together.
Somebody's broken into this vault.
How long since you were here last, Sergeant?
Not for months. Nobody's died in Llanwelly lately, and nobody comes here if he doesn't have to.
Hmm.
The door...
What about it?
It's broken from inside.
Here, give me that.
Someone must've taken the body out of the tomb.
That's not Lawrence Talbot. Not Talbot?
Do you know who this is here? Yes. That's FreddyJolly.
Who's he?
Been up for vagrancy.
Hmm.
What would you say he died of, Doctor?
Severed jugular.
This man bled to death.
Same as the constable in Cardiff.
Looks rather like the bite of an animal. Aye, that animal.
We remember it well hereabouts.
And it must've carried away the corpse of poor Sir Lawrence.
What animal? Why, didn't you know, sir?
There was a wild animal around here a few years ago.
It killed people. Bit through their throats, drained their blood.
Did they kill it? SirJohn
Talbot thought he did, sir.
He attacked it in the dark one night, or so he thought.
But it was his son he killed. Poor Mr. Larry.
Where is
SirJohn Talbot now?
Over there, sir. Died of grief shortly after.
Let's get out of here.
But the body, sir.
Mustn't touch that.
That's evidence. Yes, sir.
Sergeant, if it's convenient, I'd like to see a photograph of Lawrence Talbot.
There's one up in my office, sir. Good.
Here's Mr. Larry's photograph, sir.
Take a look at this face, Doctor.
Isn't that our man in Cardiff?
Yes. There is a similarity. But I wouldn't swear it's the same man.
Of course it's not the same man.
If it were,
I'd be off me top.
I think the sergeant here better come back to Cardiff with us... and see if he can positively identify this man.
That's the thing to do. Do you mind if I use your telephone?
I'd like to check up on my patient's condition. Of course, Doctor. Over there.
Hello? Put me through to the
Queen's Hospital in Cardiff, please.
I want to talk to
Dr. Gordon.
Have you ever heard of a Gypsy woman named Maleva?
A Gypsy woman?
A vagrant, eh?
Mm-hmm. We always register them.
Hello, Dr. Gordon?
This is Dr. Mannering speaking.
How's Lawrence Talbot doing?
You know, the head-injury case that went violent yesterday.
Did you notify the police?
Well, I suppose that's all we can do at present.
I'll be back tonight, Doctor.
Good-bye.
What happened to Talbot?
Did he die?
No, he tore off his straightjacket during the night and escaped.
Tore off his straightjacket?
How?
Bit right through it.
Tore it to shreds with his teeth.
With his teeth?
Bruno!
Stop it!
What do you want here?
I'm looking for an old Gypsy woman.
Maleva is her name.
Is she here with you?
Maleva? Yeah, she is with us.
You'll find her over there.
Maleva!
They told me you'd left England.
I've looked all over Europe for you, from town to town.
Now that I've found you, you must help me.
Come in.
What do you want from me?
Maleva, here I still carry the sign of the pentagram.
The mark of the werewolf.
I kill people.
When the moon is full,
I turn into a wolf.
It's not in my power to help you.
You're the only one that understands.
Nobody else in the world will believe me.
But you... you know.
Your own son Bela was a werewolf.
He attacked me. He changed me into a werewolf.
He's the one that put this curse on me.
You watched over him until he was permitted to die.
Well, now I want to die too.
Won't you show me the way? I can't.
But I will guard you and take care of you... as I took care of my own son.
You're not leaving us.
You're not going with him.
He has the sign of the beast on him.
He is dangerous only when the moon is full.
I shall watch over him.
He will murder you.
No. I shall take him to a place I know.
Where?
I know a man... who has the power to help you.
Help me?
Who?
Is that the town?
Yes, that is Vasaria.
At last.
Stop.
Ooh.
Let's ask in here.
Are you the proprietor? I am.
What do you beggars want?
Wejust want to ask you, sir,
about the Doctor Frankenstein.
Frankenstein? Don't mention that name around this town.
Oh, please, won't you tell us where he lives?
There.
That's his burial place.
The fire destroyed him and all his misdeeds.
He's dead?
Oh, but he can't be.
He didn't die any too soon for us.
We all wish that he'd never been born.
What did you want with him?
I heard he was a great doctor... who could help people that other doctors couldn't cure.
Him? Murder and crimes was all he ever brought us.
He harbored a monster in his house,
a thing created by black magic.
Dr. Frankenstein, dead.
Come.
Thank you, sir, for the information.
Come on.
Get out and stay out.
We don't want your kind around here.
Oh, keep your hands off of me!
Now I must go on living.
There's no hope for me to die.
Wait! Stop!
Don't go!
Wait!
Don't go!
Don't!
Who could've done this terrible thing?
Could it be the monster again?
Frankenstein's monster?
No. The monster was burned to death by Dr. Frankenstein.
Yes, we found his bones and buried them.
How do you know they were the monster's bones?
She wasn't killed by a monster.
An animal bit her to death.
I saw the wound on her throat.
What animals are around here that can kill people?
A wolf.
Yes, a wolf.
That's his cry. Come on. Let's get him.
Come on!
Come on!
There he is!
Where is he?
He was here a moment ago.
The Gypsy woman! What are you doing here?
Come on.
Speak up, old witch.
Where's that strange man that was with you?
Let's take her back to town.
We'll make her speak.
Dr. Frankenstein must've kept records.
A diary.
You know where it is.
Show me.
It isn't here.
"To my dear father".
Then... she's the one... that can tell me.
And this man, he wishes to buy the ruins of my father's estate?
Yes. That's why I asked you to come here, Baroness.
He wanted me to give him your address.
Naturally,
I refused.
But since I knew you were anxious to get rid of the property, and all the memories connected with it,
I thought that in my position as mayor...
I would take the liberty of sending for you.
- Did he say his name is Taylor?
- Yes.
And that's all
I know about him.
Baroness Frankenstein,
Mr. Taylor.
- Baroness.
- Mr. Taylor.
Come in, Mr. Taylor.
Come in, come in.
Do you mind if I speak to the baroness alone, please?
Why, uh... Why, uh, certainly, certainly.
Now, uh, if, uh...
If you need a witness for the contract, Baroness, I'm at your service.
Thank you.
Won't you please sit down, Mr. Taylor?
Thank you.
I understand that you want to buy our land.
No, I...
I wanted to meet you.
I don't understand. I didn't know how to find you, and the mayor wouldn't give me your address, so I felt that if I offered to buy your land... that you'd be sure to come.
It's certainly a most unusual way to make an acquaintance.
But now that you have gone to all this trouble to meet me, what can I really do for you?
I want your father's records.
His experiments with life and death.
The records of the creation of the monster.
My father's diary.
Yes. You must give it to me.
I don't have any records.
If I had, I...
I would have destroyed them long ago.
My father was a great scientist, but all he created brought unhappiness, terror.
Oh, but you don't understand.
I must have them.
Won't you help me?
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor.
There is nothing I can do.
The house burned down, and I have never set a foot on that ground again... and never shall.
And that's all the information I can give you.
Well, is everything settled, Baroness?
No.
We decided not to go through with the sale after all.
Why, that sounds like...
Yes, Baroness.
It's the Festival of New Wine.
It begins tonight.
It's beautiful.
Takes me back to my childhood.
Why don't you join us tonight,
Baroness, as our guest of honor?
You would take the first train in the morning.
Thank you, Mayor.
Of course I'll stay.
You, too, Mr. Taylor. I hope you will accept the invitation... to be our guest tonight, on behalf of our community.
Thank you.
I'll be there.
Eternally! I don't want to live eternally!
Stay away!
Go away, all of you!
Let me alone.!
Stay away!
Good evening,
Mr. Talbot.
I beg your pardon.
You must be mistaken. My name is Taylor. I know you by Talbot.
Lawrence Talbot. You carry your identification on your forehead.
Baroness Frankenstein,
Dr. Mannering.
How do you do,
Dr. Mannering?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
How does it happen that you're here, Doctor?
I've been looking for you, Mr. Talbot.
And you were very easy to find.
The newspapers told me where to look for you.
Fontainbleu, Aachen,
Elrad, and finally Vasaria.
I simply followed the trail and found you.
Very clever of you, wasn't it, Doctor?
Mr. Talbot is returning to England with me.
I don't think that I care to do that, Doctor.
Baroness, will you give me the honor of the next dance?
Of course.
At our Festival of New Wine, gentlemen, it's a man's privilege to ask any lady for a dance.
And vice-versa.
Excuse us.
Why have you followed me?
Talbot, you're a murderer.
Prove it. You're insane at times, and you know it.
You're sane enough now, though, to know what you're doing.
Why don't you let me take care of you?
Do you think it would do any good to put me in a lunatic asylum?
You know that's where you belong. It's the only thing to do.
That wouldn't do any good. I'd only escape again, sooner or later.
We might be able to cure you. Might prevent you...
I only want to die.
That's why I'm here.
If I ever find peace,
I'll find it here.
You understand.
Why don't you help me?
Sit down.
How can I help you?
Dr. Frankenstein left a diary.
In it are his records of the secrets of life and death.
If I can find
Dr. Frankenstein's diary,
I can break this curse and find peace in death.
That's morbid.
Besides,
Dr. Frankenstein's experiments were considered rather extraordinary.
Medical science never, never recognized them.
That's just it. Why don't you ask that girl, his daughter?
She can tell you about things Dr. Frankenstein did... that your medical science has never heard of.
Talbot, I'm appealing to your better nature... while you can still think normally.
The moon will be full again soon. You must come back with me while there's still time.
Isn't there somebody that could understand?
Gentlemen, why those serious faces?
The monster.! The monster.!
The monster.!
No. No, it's me.
Come on with me.
Well?
Not a sign of them. We shall have to wait until morning.
It's clear to me they're hiding in those ruins.
Much as I'd like to kill the monster, I'd hate to crawl around... through the dark catacombs of Frankenstein's castle in the black of the night.
What about that Frankenstein girl? She has lived up there.
Let's bring her in here.
Stop, stop.
There's no need for us all to storm after her.
She'll come in if I ask her.
Why should we treat her so fancy? She's a Frankenstein.
Wait, wait, wait.
She's a young woman who's done us no harm.
Now, stay here.
Uh, the men would like to talk to you, Baroness.
The Gypsy woman is still locked up in the prison.
Let's find out what she knows about all of this.
There's the daughter of the accursed Frankenstein.
That name has brought nothing but misery and misfortune to our village.
We want an end of it, do you hear? Tonight.
Now listen to me.
The baroness and I want nothing but to help you.
I tell you, he's lying.
I heard him this evening...
talking to that stranger about insanity and murder.
I heard it with my own ears. Don't get excited. You won't get anywhere by raving.
Dr. Mannering is right. To find and destroy the monster, we must have a plan.
We know that it's hiding in the Frankenstein ruins.
I can lead you there, if you want me to.
I know those cellars well.
Don't trust her! Don't let them fool you! They're all in this together!
Here she is.
And the Gypsy too.
She's one of your gang of murderers. You know these people?
Speak up, old witch.
I never saw them before.
What's your name?
Maleva.
Maleva?
See? He knows her. Why don't you arrest them, all of them?
Lock up these murderers. As long as
I'm mayor, justice shall be preserved.
I shall decide what is to be done in this village.
Haven't we tried before to get rid of the monster by force?
We burned down the sanitarium, and yet we didn't destroy
Frankenstein's fiendish creation.
We must be more clever this time.
Let's use our brains for once.
Whose brains? Yours? I'd rather depend on my fists.
There's no use in storming the ruins.
We must pretend to be friends with the monster.
Yes. Why not elect it mayor of Vasaria?
This monster was created artificially.
It must be destroyed by the same means.
I'll take you to the ruins now.
I'll go with you, of course.
I promise you, if you'll help me, I'll rid Vasaria of this curse once and for all.
Talbot!
Talbot!
Talbot, where are you?
Talbot, we're your friends.
They must be there.
I saw the smoke.
- What do you want?
- We have come to help you.
What do you mean?
You wanted to find my father's diary.
Yes, of course. I'll show you where it is hidden.
She speaks the truth, my son.
L... I guess
I'll have to trust you.
Steady.
They're friends.
This is Dr. Mannering.
He's come to help you, to make you well.
Yes, that's why I'm here.
Dr. Mannering.
But the diary... You said you knew where your father hid it.
Yes.
It isn't in there.
I know.
Please.
The Secret of Life and Death.
"Matter ages because it loses energy.
"This artificial body
I have created...
"has been charged with superhuman power...
"so that its span of life will be extended.
"Its lifetime will equal the lives of more than a hundred human beings.
"This, my creation, can never perish, unless...
"unless its energies are drained off artificially... by changing the poles from plus to minus".
But that's the secret of life.
What good does it do me?
I'm not interested in life.
I wasn't created artificially.
I'm a human being. I've got real blood in my veins.
What can we do to end my life?
"Energy which cannot be destroyed can be transmitted".
Well, if that's the case, then the energies from my body can be drained off also.
Dr. Frankenstein must've... performed his experiments in this room.
With these machines.
The don't seem to have been destroyed by the fire.
You must fix them...
and help me be rid of this thing that keeps me alive eternally.
When you were talking to the monster,
I was afraid you meant what you said.
What did I say?
You said you'd help him.
Of course I can't.
I mustn't.
It shouldn't be difficult to connect these wires again.
Yes, I'll need these machines.
I believe they can be repaired again.
Machines, day after day.!
What does Mannering need machines for?
Remember Dr. Frankenstein?
He ordered machines too.
I tell you, that English doctor's no better than Frankenstein himself.
Ho, hum. Always grumbling,
Vazek. Always complaining.
We've got to trust the doctor. What else can we do?
But doesn't it strike you as strange that
Mannering and that Frankenstein girl... never tell us what they're doing up there?
If it wasn't for that old Gypsy witch... driving her wagon down to buy their provisions, we'd never see any of them.
I think we ought to go up there and see for ourselves. Right.
Oh, they're not hurting us. It's none of our affair what goes on there.
Do you want to wait for disaster to strike at us again?
I'll tell you what we ought to do.
Here are the ruins.
In here are all of them.
Here runs the underground stream that drives the turbines that Frankenstein installed.
But the water comes from up here... to the dam below.
Blow up that dam and they'll all drown like rats.
All of them.
You're drunk, Vazek.
That's why I don't take your word seriously.
Otherwise, I'd have you arrested for conspiring to endanger... the lives of this community.
That's the water.
The water rushing down to turn the turbines.
That'll make the machines work.
Doctor.!
Aren't you almost ready?
I'm setting the machines now. Everything will be ready for you in a little while.
Yes, but there's so little time.
I don't want to live through another spell.
Yes, I know. But please don't bother me now. I have work to do.
Remember, Doctor.
It must be tonight.
Why don't you lock him up... so you can give your full attention to do what you promised... to destroy the danger of the monster?
Please, Elsa, I know what I have to do.
But he's insane!
Insane?
He's not insane.
He simply wants to die.
Frank! Frank!
Listen to me, Frank.
I saw my father become obsessed by his power.
He died a horrible death, just as my grandfather did.
Yes, I know.
You promised the people to rid
Vasaria of this monstrous creation.
I want to be sure that nothing, nothing whatsoever, can sway you.
It is in your hands to undo the crimes my father and grandfather committed.
We must clear the name of Frankenstein.
All right. Tonight, I will draw off the monster's energy.
And I hope I'll bring peace to both of them.
"Connecting the plus poles to the minus...
"will charge the energy output of the nervous system... as by connecting the minus to the minus".
Connect the minus to the minus.
I can't do it.
I can't destroy
Frankenstein's creation.
I've got to see it at its full power.
Frank! You're making him strong again!
Frank, stop it!
Stop the machine, Frank!
Don't pull that switch!
Where's Vazek? He said he'd blow up the dam.
They call them
"the haunted shores"... these stretches of Devonshire and Cornwall and Ireland... which rear up against the westward ocean.
Mists gather here, and sea fog, and eerie stories.
That's not because there are more ghosts here than in other places, mind you.
It's just that people who live hereabouts are strangely aware of them.
You see, day and night, year in, year out... they listen to the pound and stir of the waves.
There's life and death in that restless sound... and eternity too.
If you listen to it long enough, all your senses are sharpened.
You come by strange instincts.
You get to recognize a peculiar cold... which is the first warning.
A cold which is no mere matter of degrees Fahrenheit... but a draining of warmth from the vital centers of the living.
Local people tell me they would have felt it... even outside that locked door.
We didn't.
They can't understand why we didn't know what it meant... when our dog wouldn't go up those stairs.
Animals see the blasted things, it appears.
Well, my sister Pamela and I knew nothing about such matters... not then, we didn't.
We had the disadvantage of being Londoners... just down for a fortnight's rest.
That tenth day of May 1937 was the end of our holiday.
We seem to be in somebody's garden.
What was somebody's garden.
What a marvelous old house!
We'd better get out before we're had up for trespassing.
- Where on earth did we leave the car?
- That direction, I think.
Look, a squirrel.
- Grab Bobby!
- Too late. Bobby, come back here!
- You bad dog!
- Bobby!
He's got the poor little squirrel trapped. He'll kill it.
My dear, sweet sister, it's more likely he's having his way with our Bobby.
Fine way to spend a holiday... chasing a dog!
- Where is he?
- Under here, I think.
I thought you had him.
He had me. There he goes!
Hang on to Bobby!
I can't!
Oh, well played, sir!
- Do you suppose he can get out?
- Certainly. He's on the roof by now.
That's a smart dog.
He'll be back any minute.
Rick, have you noticed anything?
Only that I'm in no shape to join the hunting set.
No, I mean this house. It's the loveliest thing I ever saw.
- Look at that staircase.
- Oh, boy, what banisters for sliding!
- Oh, Rick.
- What is it?
Your saying that, and the house... it took me back.
- Yeah, it's quite a bit like the...
- The rose bowl there... the grandfather clock there... and Mother in her best gray moire sweeping down the stairs.
- You'll be howling in a minute. Come out.
- Not on your life.
I'm going to see the rest of this.
Come on. Let's pretend we're buying it.
I'll toss you for the bedroom with the best view.
They've all got best views.
How lovely! Why does it make me feel I'm on a boat?
It's the light on the ceiling. That's the sea. It's nice to wake up and see that.
Oh, how I do hate living in a London flat.
If you're brought up in an old house, you always hanker for one.
It's stuck. You try it.
It's locked. Family skeletons, probably.
Oh, what a bore.
Rick, the bathroom!
An open fire while you bathe.
What luxury!
You know, this is a
Saturday-night-only bathroom.
You boiled yourself as red as a lobster, then hurried to bed to avoid a chill.
- Rick.
- What?
I've had one of my feelings.
We're really going to buy this house.
Oh, yes? Did your feeling tell you what we're going to buy it with?
If we both put in everything we have, maybe we can get it.
It's terribly out of the way, and it hasn't been lived in for years.
But what would we do with it? We can't drive nearly 300 miles just for weekends.
We'll live here all the time, and you'll work at your music.
My poor lunatic sister,
I happen to have a job.
Yes, and what a job... going to concerts... and telling your readers how bad the music was.
It's not good enough,
Rick. Chuck it.
Down here you'd write your own music, as you always should have done... and as you've always wanted to.
Rick, it isn't as if you were even a good music critic.
Well, thank you very much.
Anyway, I get paid hard cash.
Well, doesn't the idea attract you at all?
Attract me?
Look, you come out of here.
You're dangerous.
Don't you know how rare houses like this are?
- I like the banisters.
- How Lizzie'd love that kitchen.
That little beach must belong to it.
It's in good condition too.
Not a sign of damp.
- We'll get our furniture out of storage
- Be calm, Pamela.
A change like this would have to be discussed for months.
Nonsense. Important decisions have to be made quickly.
Well, my paper has asked me to do a series...
"Lives of the great musicians."
Reading time: two minutes.
- There you are. That'll feed us.
- Yes, until I run out of musicians.
Anyway, how do we know the place is for sale?
Rick, life isn't as cruel as that. It's got to be.
Now remember, Pam, no signs of keenness.
We're just mildly interested. Mildly.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
We'd like to see Commander
Beech, if we may.
- He's not in at the moment.
- Could we wait for him?
Won't you come in?
There's a fire in the study.
I think I can catch my grandfather by telephone.
- Who shall I say wants to see him?
- He wouldn't know our name.
It's Fitzgerald. My sister, Pamela
Fitzgerald, and I'm Roderick Fitzgerald.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I'm Stella Meredith.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Oh, not in that chair!
It's got a lumpy seat.
- Do you mind?
- Oh, no.
- Oh, dear. Will this do?
- Thank you.
We're an awfully un-smoking house.
Grandfather had a cigar blown straight down his throat once when he was on the foredeck.
He lost his taste for tobacco.
Can I help in any way?
We wanted to talk to the commander about a house he owns... on top of the cliff.
- Windward?
- Yes.
You see, we've fallen head over heels in love with...
- I mean, it might just do for us.
- Really?
We understand from Mrs. Brown at the inn ifs for sale.
Mrs. Brown is mistaken. Sorry you've been put to the trouble of coming here.
Perhaps if we could speak to your grandfather about it...
It wouldn't be the slightest use.
I'm sorry, but there's really no point in your waiting.
Stella, are you there?
Yes, Grandfather.
In here.
Well, what is it?
Some people who came here by mistake, Grandfather.
They're just leaving.
We heard that Windward
House is for sale.
Yes, it is.
Won't you sit down?
I'll be with you in a moment.
Thank you very much.
Grandfather, please.
I thought I made myself quite clear on this point, Stella.
- Yes, Grandfather...
- I don't understand you.
A house you haven't lived in since you were a child... a piece of property we can't afford to maintain.
But it was my mother's house. It's...
- I can't put it into words. It's...
- Nonsense.
Grandfather, please!
I don't believe many repairs will be necessary.
The roof is sound... and the walls have withstood the
Atlantic gales for two centuries.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
There was a considerable sum spent on the house some 20 years ago...
- when I gave it to my daughter.
- I understand. Well, I'm sorry... but I'm afraid £1,200 is our absolute limit.
- Is that a definite offer?
- Yes.
And you would pay the entire sum immediately?
- You mean you'd sell for that?
- Yes.
I suppose you ought to have the property surveyed before we...
- Oh, Rick.
- There's no need to get suspicious.
The house is worth far more than that... but I have a very young granddaughter... and £1,200 in the bank for her would ease my mind considerably.
We understand perfectly.
And you'd not be nervous in such a lonely house?
No, indeed.
Or of the wind at nights?
It plays odd tricks in old houses.
Are you trying to tell us the house is haunted?
No, Miss Fitzgerald.
No house is haunted.
But I had some tenants five years ago who complained of... disturbances.
What was the trouble? Ladies carrying their heads under their arms?
I declined to discuss it and canceled the lease.
- But I couldn't cancel a sale.
- We wouldn't want you to.
One does feel that a story like that should bring the price down.
I've already made a very considerable reduction, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Perhaps we both need time to think the matter over.
- But our offer's definite. Isn't it, Rick?
- Oh, yes.
Very well, then. I accept it.
Title deeds and checks will be exchanged by our solicitors.
In the meantime, I have your word, and you have mine.
Well, it's wonderfully simple to buy a house, isn't it?
- Pam, where are you?
- Here I am. Look, our own roses.
Rick, it's all ours.
Isn't it wonderful?
You know, it's bigger than I thought.
I can't wait to see what's in that Bluebeard room.
Probably the housemaid's cupboard.
Slops, mops, dripping taps.
I wonder how soon we can get cleaners and painters in.
You'll go back to London, of course, while I stay here.
Rolled up in a blanket like a squaw?
At the inn, idiot, until you ship me the furniture.
Did the old boy tell you why it was locked?
Never thought to ask him.
Well, now we know.
- It's the one ugly room in the house.
- Oh, it's not so bad.
That window, it's like a cucumber frame.
They put that in later to make a painter's studio.
Even the view doesn't cheer it up.
- What'll we do with it?
- My workroom, of course.
It's ideal. Put the piano over there with shelves for music... plenty of space to walk up and down, manuscripts all over the floor... hot pincers to tear the flesh from people who keep telling me luncheon is ready... stacks of checks from my publishers, and...
- Do you think this room is damp?
- It needs airing.
It's funny it should strike so cold in here after such a warm day.
- Oh, law.
- What, Rick?
I suddenly felt completely flattened.
Do you suppose I'll ever be able to write any music here or anywhere?
What on earth are you talking about?
You don't suppose we've made the most howling mistake, do you?
Rick, have we?
Why did the commander suddenly come down in his price like that?
The disturbances. Rumors like that are dynamite if you're selling a place.
Yes. Pamela, you're not going to get scared of this ghost business, are you?
Of course not, Rick. I don't believe in them, really... and I'd be interested, not scared, wouldn't you?
Me? No, disturbances wouldn't disturb me, not for a single second.
- It's Bobby!
- Of course it's Bobby.
Now don't go getting imaginative.
It is rather a filthy room, isn't it?
We're here, Bobby.
He's trying to tell us about the squirrel, I expect.
- Didn't he keep his date with you?
- Why don't you come up, stupid?
Rick, look at that lamb of a window!
Never thought Bobby was a killer at heart.
Who's that standing out there?
Looks like the old boy's granddaughter.
Don't waste a wave on that one.
Because she didn't want us to buy the house?
- I think she'd been crying.
- Had she?
Don't you see?
She adored the house, and we've cast her out.
- Isn't it awful?
- Stop making up stories.
She didn't live here.
She just doesn't want us to.
She's an ill-mannered little dog in the manger.
All right, Bobby. We'll take you back to the inn... and let you order your dinner.
Have you forgotten something?
No. On second thought, my landing gear isn't what it used to be.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.
- Twenty Turrets, please.
- Yes, sir.
- Isn't this Windward House?
- Yes, sir. Fine house too.
Glad to hear there'll be folk in it again.
- You have a dozen of these?
- Likely I have.
Oh, maybe you're the new owner.
Yes, my sister and I bought the place yesterday.
Well, well. I hope you'll bring it back to itself again.
The last lot that lived there weren't no good.
Went away owing money.
Got out of their lease starting ugly stories about the place.
- So that's how the rumors started.
- That's what I do say.
Here you are, sir. Nine seems to be all I have.
- That's all right.
- Of course, there are others say different.
- There are?
- Well, that's only natural... after the way the lady of
Windward House died...
- God rest her soul.
- You mean the commander's daughter?
Only child. Come near breaking the old gentleman's heart.
- He's never been the same since.
- How did she die?
- Fell off the cliff.
- Accident?
That's what I do say.
Good morning, Mr. Hardy.
- A copy of Amateur Gardening, please.
- Yes, Mrs. Coatesworthy.
Well, the best of luck to you, sir.
If you have a favorite tobacco,
I'll be glad to stock it.
Thank you. Good-bye.
The gent that just bought Windward House.
You don't say.
- Mr. Fitzgerald?
- Yes?
- Oh, it's you.
- May I speak to you for a moment?
Look here, young lady... if you want to talk me out of
Windward House, save your breath.
It isn't that. It's about me, yesterday afternoon.
My behavior was inexcusable.
- Come now. It wasn't as bad as all that.
- Thank you very much.
Your grandfather made you apologize, didn't he?
Oh, no. It was my mother.
Your moth...
But I understood that...
I beg your pardon?
I kept looking at her last night, thinking how I'd let her down.
- But isn't your mother dead?
- Yes, but I know all about her.
From Grandfather, of course.
I was only three when she died.
But I thought you said you looked at her.
Her portrait hangs in my room.
My father painted it.
- Oh, then it was his studio.
- Yes, and she was so beautiful.
Let's go for a walk.
Grandfather will never get over her death.
- He's hated Windward ever since.
- That's understandable.
But it isn't fair to hate a house because someone's died there.
I love Windward because she lived there for three years... and those were my years.
And that's why you don't want anyone else to live in it?
- That's foolish, isn't it?
- No, just one thing is foolish:
You're living somebody else's life.
- How old are you, Stella Meredith?
- Twenty.
You're 20, and you're pretty.
You shouldn't be wasting a single second looking back on three little years.
- You should be having fun.
- I am.
Oh, nonsense! What are you doing today, for instance?
- Oh, just things.
- Facts, details.
Oh, dear. I've got to match some wool.
Then I have to stop at the library and get a copy of Bleak House.
Grandfather and I are reading Dickens.
You're not going to do any of those things. I have a much better idea.
Isn't this better than reading to Grandfather?
- Oh, it's wonderful.
- Ever get seasick?
Fortunately, I have a stomach like Gibraltar.
Not externally, of course.
- Are you asleep?
- No.
Just wondering if our national confidence in Gibraltar isn't misplaced.
Shouldn't you get out of the sun?
No, I'd...
I'd rather... remain here.
Oh, please! The tiller... please!
- Smells good.
- That's mimosa. It was my mo...
Oh, I forgot. I'm not supposed to talk about that.
- Why?
- Out of the past.
- Oh, go ahead.
- It was my mother's favorite perfume.
My father sent me a bottle before he died.
I've made it last a long time.
Mimosa. Ever see it growing?
- No, I haven't.
- Like a million little yellow bells.
Like... Like sleigh bells.
It's smooth again.
Are you feeling better?
Oh, yes. I was about to resume command.
Bring her about sharply.
Head straight for the jetty.
Avast the boom.
Scuttle the funnels.
Lady, please!
I thought you'd gone off for London, Mr. Fitzgerald.
- Just leaving now, Ben.
- That'd be half a crown.
- You doing up your hair again?
- Yes.
No, no, no! Come on.
It's wonderful like this, all loose and free and windblown.
What am I doing? Talking high poetry or selling hairstyle advertising?
- You laugh at everything, don't you?
- Too much?
No. It's just I've never known anyone who laughed much.
See a lot of Pamela while
I'm away, will you?
- How long will you be gone?
- About three weeks.
Perhaps she'll let me help her with the curtains and things.
Get her to talk about me.
In a respectful way, of course.
None of those anecdotes where
I'm the family half-wit.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- I'll take you home first.
- You're so late starring.
Might as well.
I'd rather break it gently to Grandfather about our sail, if you don't mind.
All right. Gently but firmly, mind.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
- Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald...
- Yes?
I almost forgot to say it.
I'm awfully happy you and your sister are going to live at Windward.
Why, thank you, Stella Meredith!
Well, here we are.
What a grand house, Master Rick.
'Tis a mansion, so 'tis.
Are you worthy of it, Lizzie Flynn?
That's what I keep asking myself.
'Tis on top of the world.
- Rick!
- Hello, Pam.
- Baby darling!
- Lizzie!
Oh, you devil for being late.
I wanted you to see everything while it was still daylight.
Ah, Master Rick and his friends and their cocktails.
- Got Lizzie drunk.
- Get on with you, Master Rick.
- Oh, Bobby!
- Where's our Bobby?
- Don't, Rick.
- Something happen to him?
Nothing tragic. He just wandered away.
I suppose I haven't enough dog appeal.
- No, seriously, Pam.
- He loathed the country.
You know, no nice dustbins and no sporting interest in finding a tree.
Never heard of a terrier walking out.
Ah, Miss Pamela, I'm dreaming on me feet.
Pam, it's perfect. You're practically straight.
There's some soup in the kitchen.
Look at Whiskey now.
He knows where the food is.
- How did the furniture fit in?
- Beautifully.
I saw the grandfather clock.
It waved both hands at me.
If the soup's burned,
Lizzie will spank me.
Get along with you, miss.
The saints be praised!
There's me old rocker.
It's been 10 years since you nestled your bustle in that.
- You've done wonders, Pam.
- Thanks.
Tell me, what does Stella think of the changes?
You mean Stella Meredith?
- I haven't set eyes on her.
- You haven't?
I did write and ask her to tea.
Got a reply from the commander... saying she wasn't strong enough to accept invitations.
Not strong enough?
I expect it's us. We just aren't nice to know.
But Stella was crazy to make friends with you. She told me.
But where did you see her?
Oh, uh, just before
I left for London.
Why, you colossal bluff!
You were just as sorry for that child as I was.
Stop pushing her into the nursery.
She's 20. She said so herself.
You like her.
I can't help it.
There's kind of a sleeping-beauty magic about the kid.
I'd thought I'd done something toward breaking the spell.
Seems not.
Prince Charmless, that's me.
That'll do for tonight, Mr. Roderick.
It's time for Miss Pamela to go to bed. She looks tired out.
You're an old tyrant, Lizzie Flynn.
But you're perfectly right.
Put the lights out, Rick.
Now let's see. I think I turn it down and blow down the chimney.
Haven't done that since I was a kid.
Come now, Whiskey. Good boy.
- Are you having him in your room?
- He's used to it, the creature.
Get along up, now.
Haven't I carried you enough this day?
- Get on up, now.
- I'll give him a start.
What in the name of all the saints?
Well, he's not used to traveling and strange houses.
He'll find me if he wants me.
I've not slept with the sound of the sea since I left Ireland.
Would you like to go back there?
- I'd sooner see meself dead.
- Ah, go on with yez.
Why, whatever ails these candles?
It seems to be a rather drafty staircase.
Rick, I've had a swim every day from our own beach... and I've started to make a garden.
You learn the oddest things when you garden.
Did you know there's an upside-down to seeds?
- No. Good night, Pam.
- Good night, Rick.
- Good night, Master Rick.
- Good night, Liz.
Come in.
I thought you were asleep.
It turns cold in the night here sometimes.
Oh, thanks.
Rick, there's something I want to talk to you about.
Do you have any nice cast iron
I can swap for this mattress?
- We'll give you another tomorrow.
- Nothing will keep me awake tonight.
What price our house,
Pam? Pretty good, hmm?
- You're really pleased with it?
- I was never so happy in my life.
Oh, you starred to say something. What?
It was just that I was the one that got you to buy the house...
And I didn't appear very appreciative. Is that it?
It'll wait until tomorrow.
Bless you, Rick. Sleep well.
You too.
These are pretty good apples.
That concludes our broadcast for today.
Good night, everyone. Good night.
Pam, is that you?
- Rick.
- Pamela.
- We don't want to wake Lizzie.
- But isn't it Lizzie?
No, it isn't Lizzie.
It's coming from downstairs.
It comes from everywhere and nowhere.
Take hold of yourself, Pam. I'm going down and search the place.
Rick, I've searched.
- There's never anything there.
- "Never"? You mean you've heard it before?
YES.
Rick, it's true, isn't it? The sound,
I mean. You're hearing it too?
- Of course I'm hearing it.
- I wasn't sure.
- Pam...
- I thought I might be going crazy.
- Was that why you didn't tell me?
- Yes, that, and...
Rick, it's your home. It's all we've got to live in.
- It sounds so heartbroken.
- Now don't get rattled, Pam.
- There's a logical explanation for this.
- Such as?
You can't expect me to give it to you offhand, but it stands to reason.
- Does it come every night?
- No.
Just when you begin to think you dreamt it, it comes again.
Be calm, Pam. Be calm.
I'm all right.
It'll stop soon now.
How do you know?
It dies away at dawn.
Listen.
That's the dawn breeze.
- Well, that's all for tonight.
- It's a pity, really.
Hardly gives one time to look into it. Now listen, dear.
Look, let's talk tomorrow.
I'll die if I don't get some sleep.
Pam, leave your door open in case you're nervous.
All right, Rick.
And remember, you haven't a thing to worry about.
This business can be scientifically explained.
Probably a loose wire hidden around the house, acting as an aerial... picking up the sound of some woman in the village crying.
Was she crying when the last tenants were frightened out?
Well, maybe she had a sad life.
Anyway...
I'm here now, and I'm not the least rattled.
Not the least little bit in the world.
It's just silly to be upset.
Last night I heard it myself, Commander Beech.
A perfectly appalling sound of crying.
Mr. Fitzgerald, Windward
House belongs to you now.
- Why do you bring this matter to me?
- Because we want information.
I for practical reasons, and my sister because she believes it's a ghost.
- She'd like to know what the ghost wants.
- What utter bosh!
Bosh, I agree, but when did the noises start?
- You inherited the house, I believe.
- From my grandmother.
And there were no disturbances there in her time?
None. And if there are noises now, they're from perfectly natural causes.
An echo from a subterranean cave, perhaps.
That would've been heard in your grandmother's day.
Erosion may have changed the structure of the cliffs.
- It's not' a bad suggestion.
- May I come in, Grandfather?
No, you run along to church.
I'll join you in a few minutes.
- But I want to see Mr. Fitzgerald.
- I'm glad you're better.
"Better"? But I haven't been ill.
Stella merely suffers with a general delicacy.
- She doesn't accept invitations.
- Never?
Perhaps I'd better frankly state she's not strong enough to make new friends.
- Grandfather!
- Run along, my dear.
We're discussing something privately.
Is there anything else, Mr. Fitzgerald?
Just one more question. Was Stella's mother ever troubled at Windward House?
- What do you mean?
- Did she hear the crying?
My daughter was not one to circulate ridiculous rumors.
If she'd heard this, she'd have mentioned it, and she never did?
Certainly not.
Then the trouble must have begun since her death.
- Do you mean to imply...
- No, I'm merely trying to set the date.
- I didn't mean that your daughter haunts
- How dare you suggest such a thing?
Really, I'm most desperately sorry. Please forgive me.
Very well. I accept your apology.
But please understand one thing.
Your purchase of the property doesn't establish a social bond between us.
What's the matter with us? Why don't you allow Stella to see us?
Because I don't want to.
And I must ask for your word not to send her any more invitations.
I'll give you no such undertaking.
Very well. I shall know how to deal with the matter.
Stella is not going inside that house!
Great Scott! You believe the place is haunted.
I hoped you'd come along.
I wanted to talk to you.
- Quick, drive around the next corner.
- Get in.
You had four freckles on the boat. They've gone.
I couldn't go to see your sister.
Grandfather's been ill.
Turn here.
Now, what is this about your not seeing Pamela?
At the mention of me coming to Windward,
Grandfather almost had an attack.
You feel your mother never would've left him?
No, never.
Yet she did when she married, and he seemed to survive very nicely.
He was younger then.
Oh, so you're going to turn into one of these dim little ladies... who fill hot-water bottles for elderly relatives.
- Good-bye, Stella Meredith.
- I'm not now.
You're here now.
That's practically the nicest sentence that ever was spoken.
Would you and your sister be in if I came to Windward tonight?
Yes.
Supper's at 8:00, but please come as early as you can.
Bob down. He's passing the end of the lane.
He's gone.
How will I ever get to church?
Sit on the floor, and
I'll drive you past him.
- Drive to the side gate, please.
- Yes.
- Like a lift, Commander?
- No, thank you.
Oh! What a moment!
- Were you scared?
- Yes, but it was wonderful.
Well, good-bye. Say a little prayer for me.
Golly! How am I ever going to feel meek enough for church?
Oh, Stella.
Here's your prayer book and purse.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Thank you, Mrs. Carlton, Colonel.
- Until next Sunday.
- Yes.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
You seem very silent, Stella.
What have you against the
Fitzgeralds, Grandfather?
Well, they're hardly our sort.
I've decided to make friends with them.
You'll do no such thing.
Why do you say that, Grandfather?
I do not consider it suitable for you to visit Windward House.
- Not suitable?
- I can't discuss the matter.
- That's all the reason I'm going to get?
- It will have to suffice, yes.
No, Grandfather. I'm 20, and I'm... and it's time I stopped living somebody else's life.
- I shall go to Windward whenever I please.
- Did you hear what I said?
It isn't any good,
Grandfather. I'm on strike.
Stella, go to your room.
No use trying to lock me in.
There isn't any key.
Now don't be impertinent.
- Hello, Annie.
- Dinner will be late, miss.
I'm having ever such trouble with the lamb.
You'd better tell the commander.
Yes, it's very urgent. Will you try to hurry the call?
Thank you. I'm telephoning.
Close that door.
It's just that dinner will be late, sir. It's the lamb being awkward.
I won't be here for dinner.
And take some to Stella on a tray.
And close that door!
May I speak to Miss Holloway?
It's a trunk call, Miss Holloway.
A Commander Beech.
Thank you.
Yes, Commander Beech?
I want to consult you about
Stella, Miss Holloway.
It's a matter of the utmost urgency.
I can be with you late this afternoon.
I can't see you till this evening, but I shall be glad to put you up for the night.
Isn't it a little late to consult me about Stella?
Yes, I know that, but I beg you to help me now.
You're the only human being in the world to whom I can turn.
The only person who wouldn't think me demented... because I believe a house can be filled with malignity.
Malignity directed against a certain child.
The dining room isn't finished yet.
How glad this house must be to be lived in again.
I must dash back to Lizzie.
We're fighting... over how much sherry you put in a tipsy pudding.
She wants to make it dead drunk.
- Do you like tipsy pudding?
- I think I like everything to eat.
Show her the rest of the house before it's dark.
You've really never been here since you were three?
Not inside.
But I walked here once when I was ten and peered in at the windows.
There was a stupendous row... and the next week I got packed off to a school in Brussels.
- Did your grandfather give you reasons?
- "Reasons"?
If I'd ever been reasoned with,
I might have been a better child.
- My old nursery's through there, isn't it?
- I should think so. It had nursery wallpaper.
How pretty your sister's made it!
What is it?
Something I'd forgotten.
When I was little...
I used to have a dream about this room.
You did?
I'd be lying here, and it'd be dark... and cold and frightening.
And then... a little flame would come.
Just a tiny point of light so big... and yet suddenly everything would be... warm and light and peaceful.
And then... someone would come and put the flame out, and I'd be terrified.
Perhaps your mother used to bring you a night light.
But who'd take it out?
May I see the studio before it's dark?
It's rather messy in here.
I was thinking of skipping this.
This is where my father painted my mother's picture.
Strange to think of them here.
My father would have his easel to the light, wouldn't he?
And perhaps my mother would sit there in her soft, white dress.
But sometimes, of course, he'd paint the other one.
- "The other one"?
- He had a model, you know.
A foreign girl.
I've never been able to find out much about her.
People get awfully hush-hush when I ask them.
Between you and me and the grand piano...
I suspect Father was a bit of a bad hat.
- Artistic temperament?
- Very artistic, I'm afraid.
But sometimes, you know, it's quite a comfort to me.
- In what way?
- If Father had been as good as Mother... think how good I'd have been.
It's getting almost too dark to see you properly.
Won't you play something?
It's about time you asked me that.
- Oh, please go on.
- Just a second.
- You made that up?
- Yes.
- But you must be brilliant!
- Oh, dazzling.
- People have to wear sunglasses.
- What's it called?
It's a serenade.
"To Stella by Starlight."
You mean, this Stella?
But it's the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me!
Is it?
Please go on.
You see, this is the only way I can paint you.
Some black keys and some white... and fingers that are much too clumsy... but you're in it somehow.
It's gone awfully sad.
Why have you changed it?
It just came out that way.
What's the matter? What is it,
Stella? You're trembling.
I was wicked. How could I ever have laughed in her house?
But it's my house now, Pam's and mine.
But she was so young, and she died so cruelly.
Stella!
Stella!
- Rick, what is it?
- I don't know. It's that blasted room!
Stella, stop!
Stella!
For heaven's sake, Stella!
- What's the matter, Rick?
- You were going over the edge.
- Was I?
- If I hadn't caught you.
I hadn't any sense of danger at all.
Look.
I think this is where my mother fell. By the dead tree.
Are you all right?
Quite, thanks, except dying of hunger.
Then you must come and get some food.
Do you know this is our very first party in this house?
- Is it?
- Shall we sing her the song?
His introduction to music.
Stay here.
Lizzie, where are you?
What's the matter?
Mr. Roderick! Mr. Roderick!
- What is it, Lizzie? Are you hurt?
- The studio door... there's something there.
Look, Lizzie, there's nothing there.
There was! I saw it with me own two eyes!
What?
It was like a mist... a crawling mist.
You imagined it just because you heard the house was haunted.
I'd heard nothing of the sort, Mr. Roderick.
Holy saints! Are you tellin' me it is?
For heaven's sake,
Rick, what is it?
Oh, Lizzie's dreamed up a ghost for herself.
Come along, Lizzie.
Oh, darling Lizzie.
I'd just come upstairs to turn down the beds.
There it stood by the studio door, looking down at me.
- A woman, it was.
- Four steps back, it was just a mist.
'Twas a woman. I swear it.
The ghost of a woman!
Come and sit down. You'll be all right in a minute.
- Have some sherry, Lizzie.
- Just a drop.
I'll not sleep in this house another night, Mr. Roderick.
- Come now, Lizzie.
- I will not! I'd sooner die.
She can go to the Jessup farm.
What's happened to Stella?
She was with me when I came in.
Stella?
Stella, where are you?
Stella, are you in the house?
Stella!
Pamela! Pamela!
Stella, darling.
Yes, Rick? What's happened?
- Rick, what is it?
- She's in a dead faint.
- This room, it's like an icebox.
- Colder.
We'll have to get a doctor.
There's one at the first house in the village.
That's a girl.
Well, what kind of bogey did you see?
I didn't see anything.
Fainted out of sheer cussedness, huh?
I can only remember the cold coming.
Hello, Stella.
- Hello.
- You suddenly felt cold?
It wasn't just that.
- The room went cold, and I was frightened.
- Well, you just forget about it for a bit.
Miss Fitzgerald's got some soup for you.
See if you can get her to take some.
She'll do all right, but it's quite a nasty case of shock.
- That's all? You're quite sure?
- Sit down.
You see, I brought her here.
Take that neat.
Can, uh... Can she stay the night here?
Oh, yes. But suppose that spook starts howling?
Oh, your spook.
It's just an echo from a cave probably, but it sounds like a spook.
I'd rather risk it than move her tonight.
There was some rather queer business earlier this evening.
The cliff is so close, and she walked right to the edge. If I hadn't caught her...
We'll keep a close watch.
- Did she take her soup?
- Eight spoonfuls, then drifted off to sleep.
Splendid. She'll sleep for hours now.
- We'll keep on watch here.
- You'd better go to bed, Miss Fitzgerald.
- You're looking all in.
- I'd rather watch with you.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Thanks.
Pam, who do you think's moved in with Dr. Scott?
- Our Bobby.
- No!
I found the poor dog in the street.
He was in a pitiable state of nerves.
- How is he now?
- Fine.
- Bobby was the first to see the ghost.
- See? Pamela believes it.
Rick, stop hiding your head in the sand.
You heard the sounds last night.
Lizzie's been half frightened out of her wits... and Stella's been in deadly danger twice.
Everyone in the village knows the house is strange.
I expected support from you.
You must tell us everything you know about the place after I've made the coffee.
Unfortunately I'm a newcomer to Biddlecombe.
I've only lived here 12 years.
It's not ancient history to us. Please go on.
The model's name was Carmel.
She was a Spanish gypsy, and a thorough bad lot.
So was Meredith, from what I can gather.
- Didn't Mrs. Meredith suspect? - She must have. The thing was an open scandal.
The girl and he'd have been stoned out of the village if not for Mary Meredith.
She was very much admired. I suppose she just accepted the situation.
And she's still sobbing her hear: out about it.
- Where's Carmel now?
- Dead. She died in this very house... a week after Mary fell from the cliff trying to save her from suicide. Ironic, wasn't it?
- Is it known why the girl tried to kill herself?
- Meredith's said to have tired of her.
Think of it... those two women struggling on the cliff.
I wonder if Mary's death could have been murder.
It's been hinted at.
The whole story was dug up and embroidered when Stella's father died.
- When was that?
- Three years ago, abroad.
- He never came back to Windward.
- All of them dead with their secrets.
One of them's not quite dead enough for me.
Don't say that about the poor soul.
If a spirit comes back, it's for some particular purpose.
- That's my sister's special crotchet.
- We've got to find out what it is.
I wish I knew some more, but I'm afraid I don't.
- What time's your wailing lady due?
- About dawn.
We ought to know each other pretty well by then.
Twenty-one hand. I'm out.
- Is it my deal?
- It was, two hours ago.
Yes, Moaning Martha seems to have missed her cue.
Rick, have you brought some more flowers in?
No. Why?
Don't you notice the scent?
It's overpowering.
Extraordinary.
Heliotrope, isn't it?
No.
No, it's mimosa.
- There's a light!
- Where did that come from?
It's like a night-light.
She's gone!
Rick, the window!
- What is it?
- Where are you, Stella?
Don't be afraid, Stella.
- "Afraid"?
- Well, we were, a little.
I wanted to see the dawn with her.
"Her"?
Don't you know who it is in your house?
- It's my mother.
- You saw her?
I didn't see her... but when I woke, she was here in the room.
It was full of her scent. I could feel her presence everywhere.
And there was something else... something I've never known in my whole life.
What?
The knowledge that... someone loved me very dearly.
Come on, young Stella.
I'll take you home.
But I don't want to go.
Sorry, but I've got to get some sleep, you know.
- But I can come back?
- No.
What do you mean? You couldn't want to keep me away from her.
Stella, remember how ill you were last night?
But that was nothing to do with her.
I think I was just frightened after what Lizzie said.
I tell you, my mother would never hurt me.
I shan't be afraid again. Please.
I'm sorry. It's just that my knees are wobbly.
Come along. Dr. Scott will drive you home.
I wonder what I've done to her, bringing her here.
Don't blame yourself.
But that look in her eyes, that terrible happiness.
Wait a minute. Perhaps she's nearer right than we are.
- She's what?
- Perhaps she's right in being happy.
Supposing Mary Meredith's spirit had been searching for Stella... and now that it's found her, it's found peace.
Suppose we haven't a ghost anymore.
- Where are you going?
- To the studio.
How has it always shown itself in the past?
Sobbing sounds downstairs, and cold and depression in the studio.
There wasn't any sobbing tonight, only warmth and fragrance.
- But why the studio?
- I'll know in there.
I'll know whether it's a decent, human room. Won't you?
It may not be quite so cold, really.
Oh, stop it, Pam.
It's clammy and rotten.
Whatever it is, it's in here with us.
Let's get out.
Mary Meredith, please.
Please. We're sorry you had to suffer.
Isn't that enough?
What more do you want?
You were right about one thing, Pam:
We haven't a ghost anymore.
We've got two of them.
- Is Commander Beech at home?
- He won't be back until this evening, sir.
- It's Miss Stella I really want to see.
- Won't you come in? I'll tell her.
Thank you.
Miss Stella's in her room, sir. I'll...
- Rick.
- Stella.
- I knew you couldn't mean it.
- Mean what?
Haven't you come to take me to Windward?
No, Stella.
You mustn't go there again, ever.
Listen, darling...
I've thought this thing out, and you must go away from here.
- Go away?
- Yes, forever.
You wouldn't care?
Not in the least, because
I'll be coming with you.
It won't be luxury, just the smallest
London flat, but it'll be ours.
And no unseen, uninvited guests.
- And Windward?
- We'll tear it down and forget it.
And my mother?
But Stella, you're talking of a dream and a memory.
I'm talking about my mother.
She's been waiting for me.
In some queer sort of way, I always knew it.
What about me? I was under the impression you cared for me.
This hasn't anything to do with you.
You talk about destroying that house.
You'd be tearing me apart.
Stop it, Stella. Do you care for me or don't you?
I can't think about you, not while she's out there.
Take me there.
But this is horrible, unhealthy stuff. Put it out of your mind.
Turn your back on the past and run, run hard.
I'll go there somehow.
- You won't, I promise you.
- I hate you for that.
Stella.
You shan't make me forget her! You shan't!
That's enough, Bobby.
That's enough.
You'll get lipstick poisoning.
He's got a passion for hard-boiled eggs. Did you know?
And turnip tops.
I don't think he has any idea he's a dog. Not really.
Of course, he thinks he has a rather odd figure for a man.
I didn't question him very closely about where he belonged.
I was afraid I might find out.
I'm sorry now.
- Sorry?
- Yes. I should've met you sooner.
- Are you there, Scott?
- In here.
- Did you see Stella?
- Yes, I did.
You've got to do something.
She's on the edge of a collapse.
You're telling me? This is hardly a case for a country doctor, you know.
- When does the commander get back?
- Last train tonight.
- Heaven help young Stella then.
- Look here.
Can't you convince her her mother wouldn't want her to go near that house?
Not I. She's been listening for a voice that's been still for 17 years.
I can give her a sedative.
Why don't we try to get a message from Mary Meredith?
- Do what?
- We could hold a séance.
You're not serious?
That's how the dead are supposed to communicate with the living.
- According to the idiot fringe.
- You have no right to say that.
Many intelligent people believe in spiritualism.
- Have you ever been to a séance?
- I have.
Shaded lights, the alphabet laid out on the table, an upside-down wine glass... messages from somebody's Uncle Oswald, how to find a mislaid toothbrush. Oh!
Stop scoffing, Rick.
Not all séances are faked.
All right, we'll have a séance.
It shouldn't be difficult to move a glass around and say it's Mary Meredith.
- What do you think?
- Leave me out of this.
I won't let you cheat Stella.
What do you expect Mary
Meredith to tell her?
"Entrust your life to a tall, dark man, excruciatingly handsome"?
Crikey, no! I want to set Stella's mind at rest. She's just about torn in two.
Unless the conflict inside her is stopped...
- it may even affect her reason.
- Here's a message that might do it:
"Stella, this is your mother. Since
I've found you, I've found peace.
Stay away from Windward House."
- Stella would have to be at the séance.
- Naturally.
It'll have to be at Windward, and it's dangerous for her.
- We'd be with her all the time.
- All right. It may be worth a try.
The important thing is that we should all believe.
- Isn't it, Dr. Scott?
- So I understand. What now?
Everybody puts a finger on the glass.
Perhaps you should ask some questions, Stella.
Is anybody here?
Are you my mother?
You don't want me to stay away from Windward, do you, Mother?
Oh, I knew it, Mother.
And I want to be near you too.
Is that why you stay here, just to be near me?
But you're holding it, Rick.
And you, Dr. Scott. Holding it hard.
Take your fingers off.
Is that your reason, darling?
Just to be near me?
But what else?
I...
G...
U... A...
"I guard."
You mean, you guard me from some danger?
But what?
C...
A...
R...
- M...
- "Carmel."
- That's enough.
- It is indeed.
Let's go into the other room.
- Stella, what is it?
- Are you ill, Stella?
Quiet. Leave her alone.
Oigan. ¡Oigan!
- Stop her, Scott!
- She's in a trance.
I saw this happen once before at a séance. I thought it was a fake.
- But this isn't.
- I know. It's dangerous.
- May I ask her some questions?
- No!
It may be best to try and reach her mind.
Now keep your voice quiet and reassuring.
Are you Mary Meredith,
Stella's mother?
Ella no e'. Ella no e'!
¡No le crean na'!
¡No le pongan oido que está mintiendo!
Don't ask her any more!
That's the doorbell.
Shall I answer it?
Lizzie's at the Jessups'.
No. Don't move until she's over the worst of this.
¡So' ladrona!
!Ladrona de mi cariño!
- Spanish, isn't it, Scott?
- I don't know.
Rick, the mimosa scent!
The room's full of it!
Mary Meredith's in here too.
The cold.
It's never been cold in here.
The candles! Look at the candles!
- I'd better answer it.
- All right.
Stop, Pamela!
Don't go near that door.
It's coming toward us!
What in thunder is this?
- Stella dear, it's all right now.
- We must get her out.
What have you been doing to the child?
- What's the meaning of this, Dr. Scott?
- I can't explain now.
- This is incredible behavior!
- Quietly, Stella.
- There's nothing to be frightened of.
- Control yourself, child!
Don't speak to her like that!
You're responsible for this.
You and your meddling.
And so are you. Why didn't you tell us the truth?
- I warned you.
- Only of idle gossip.
Perhaps you'd like your money back. You shall have it, the entire purchase price.
No, thank you, Commander.
I know this now:
Stella will never be well until this house is cured.
Somehow we're going to cure it.
Dr. Scott, have the goodness to drive us home.
There. Now you'll sleep all right.
I'll be here early in the morning.
Stella is no longer your patient. Nor am I.
- But someone must look after her.
- That is not your concern, Dr. Scott.
- I shall be at your disposal at any hour.
- Thank you.
Everything will be all right.
Won't you come in, Miss Holloway?
- Is she asleep?
- Not yet.
Hello, Stella.
Miss Holloway.
Go to sleep, Stella.
Dr. Scott tells me she went into a trance tonight.
Spoke some words they thought were Spanish.
How did she happen to be at Windward?
The people who bought the place are searching into its past.
- Are they indeed?
- Can you make the child well again?
I hope so.
It won't be a short process.
She's far more ill than you imagine.
She won't want to go with you.
She's never outgrown her fear of you.
I could've cured it years ago if you'd let me have her... as Mary would have wished me to.
Her place was in Mary's home. I've taught her to be like Mary in every way.
- How can you say such a thing?
- She's not so beautiful, of course.
Mary was a goddess.
Her skin was radiant, and that bright, bright hair.
How this room brings her back to me.
The nights we sat talking in front of that fireplace... planning our whole lives.
It wasn't flirtations and dresses we talked about.
We were no silly, giggling girls.
- We intended to conquer life.
- You at least did.
Will you try to take
Mary's place with her now?
I'll do my best.
She's asleep.
If you'll call my chauffeur, he'll carry her downstairs.
It will be better for her to wake at my place.
I'm deeply grateful to you.
So they're searching into the past.
They shan't ever find out, my darling.
I promise you.
- Elizabeth Flynn, where are yez?
- I'm here, Mr. Roderick.
And will you please come here at once?
Don't we get any breakfast?
What's the matter?
Oh, that. That happened last night.
I am not talking about that.
- I'm talking about this.
- The anagram letters. Yes, yes.
Anagrams, is it?
Don't you try to bluff me, Mr. Roderick.
'Tis a heathen device to call devils out of hell.
Stop looking at me as though you were gonna take away my bicycle.
I will not stay in a house where it goes on, and that is an "ultimato"!
Come now, Lizzie. From now on we're through with all this rubbish.
- We're going after facts.
- What facts?
The facts about this blasted haunting.
Rick, why burden Lizzie with this?
Whist now, Miss Pam.
Where will we start, Mr. Rick?
I don't know. Everybody seems to be dead.
- The trained nurse isn't.
- What trained nurse?
She was here when it happened... the friend of the lady that went over the cliff.
Where did you hear all this?
What do you suppose we talk of at the Jessups?
It was the trained nurse that shouted down to Mr. Jessup on the shore.
- Was Jessup in on the tragedy?
- He was after some lost sheep.
The tide was out, so he went down.
And as he passed under the dead tree, he heard a scream.
- Mrs. Meredith?
- No.
'Twas the scream of a terrified child.
As he ran towards it, the poor lady came crashing down.
- 'Twas then that the nurse called.
- Lizzie Flynn, you're a gold mine.
- If we could only get the name of the nurse.
- Ah, that's easy. Wait, now.
- Mr. Jessup?
- Yes, Mrs. Flynn.
What was the name of
Mrs. Meredith's trained nurse... the one that got so famous and grand?
- Miss Holloway.
- Aye. Miss Holloway.
She has a big, fine place of her own now. A hospital, like.
'Tis on Bodmin Moor. She calls it the Mary Meredith Retreat.
- Mr. and Miss Fitzgerald?
- Yes.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.
Wait in there, please, and I will announce you to Miss Holloway.
The place is quite stunning, isn't it?
- Why are you whispering?
- Why are you?
A gentleman!
- How very unusual.
- Good afternoon.
Oh, dear me. Yes. Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Are you by any chance waiting to see Miss Holloway?
Yes, we have an appointment.
What lucky people!
And what luck for me too, because
I'm sure you won't mind.
- But perhaps you will.
- Is there something we can do?
Oh, if you'd be so very kind. You see... this isn't my day for an interview and I want her to have these.
What are they, bird's eggs?
But that's very funny, because, you see, I'm Miss Bird.
They're just little stones... because she likes simple things and she has so many flowers.
- There isn't much else one can find.
- Well, I'll give them to her.
Thank you.
And now, I... think I'll just go out for a little walk.
Go back to your work at once, Miss Bird.
Don't forget.
Will you come this way, please?
- Shall I take them?
- No, I'll deliver them.
As you wish.
Come in.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
This is so kind of you.
I was asked to give you these by a Miss Bird, I believe.
Poor Miss Bird. Our saddest case.
They're really very fine stones, aren't they?
I must remember to thank her for them.
She comes to me once a week for a little chat.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Forgive our ignorance. We know so very little of your work.
Is it with mental patients?
Not patients, Miss Fitzgerald.
Just guests.
In a way this is like a hotel... where there are beautiful things to look at, music to hear... and a little sympathy.
But don't let's talk about me.
You told me on the telephone about disturbances at Windward.
How can I help you?
We thought perhaps you could tell us what Mary and Carmel were really like.
They were extraordinary women, both of them.
Mary Meredith was the finest human being I ever knew.
- Is that she?
- Yes.
- And Carmel?
- Oh, she was exceptional too.
I never saw such intensity of evil.
She was a Spanish gypsy.
Crafty, cruel.
- I'm sorry.
- Why did Mrs. Meredith put up with it?
She thought Meredith should be the one to end the affair.
- And did he?
- Yes, in time.
She and Meredith took the girl to Paris... found a position for her, left her well supplied with money.
Then they came back here with their baby.
For a time it seemed as if there were some possibility of happiness.
- And then?
- Carmel came back.
She still wanted Mary's husband.
You know how it ended.
A neighbor of ours spoke of something we can't quite understand.
He mentions a child crying on the cliff that night.
A terrified child.
That's a part of the story so ugly,
I've never mentioned it before.
We're sorry to distress you.
That night, the girl Carmel had been told she must leave Windward.
If she could've killed both Mary and her husband, she'd have done so.
A better plan flashed into her wicked little brain.
She went into the nursery, picked up their baby, and raced to the cliff.
- Good heavens!
- Mary was after her in a second...
Meredith and I close behind. Carmel reached the cliff by the dead tree.
For a moment I saw them struggling... then Carmel raised her arm and struck Mary down.
Then it was murder?
The will to kill had always been there, I think.
Directed against Stella.
Can that be what survives?
Maybe that accounts for Stella's queer business on the cliff.
- What was that?
- Something in that house... drove her out toward the edge, and if
I hadn't caught her, she'd have gone over.
Would she indeed?
How very curious.
Please, finish your story.
It was finished.
Everything was finished.
Meredith went down the cliff.
Mary was dead when he reached her.
- And Carmel?
- She ran out into the storm.
Next morning, she crawled back in the early stages of pneumonia.
I fought for Carmel's life day and night... hating her all the time!
How awful for you.
I'm sorry, I discipline others.
I... I can't discipline myself.
There. Have I told you everything you want to know?
All except one thing.
That last night, who told Carmel she must go?
Why, Mary... I should say Meredith.
It's the one decent thing
I ever knew him to do.
This... This is all extremely...
I'm sorry.
May I offer you tea?
Thank you, but we must get back before our maid leaves.
She won't stay at
Windward after dark.
I'm afraid I haven't been much help with your problem.
Well, thank you anyway, and good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Good afternoon, my dear.
- Did you want to see me?
- I've been asking for you all day.
I'm being treated as though I were insane.
Has anyone used that word?
- I've told them a thousand times...
- It isn't a question of a word.
My door's kept locked, and there's a queer look in their eyes.
- Oh, you feel persecuted.
- No.
About the cliff at
Windward, Stella... what did you feel as you ran toward it?
I didn't feel anything.
I was sad in the house.
Was it as though some will were directing you...
- a will stronger than yours?
- The sea sounded loud and beautiful.
- I just went in that direction.
- In fact, you don't quite know.
- I want to see my grandfather.
- You will in time.
Does Grandfather know what this place is like?
That woman who laughs...
I hear laughing all night!
And that other woman that...
Your grandfather's sorry that you have to be here... but he knows you'll be better soon.
"Better"? But I'm perfectly all right!
I wouldn't say that, Stella dear.
And please don't keep asking to see me.
Why do you hate me, Miss Holloway?
You see? You do feel persecuted.
Rick, if I should ever happen to lose my mind...
I don't think you'll lose it.
It might rattle to one side.
But if I do, no Mary
Meredith Retreat for me.
Plain, old-fashioned lunatic asylum, not that creepy horror.
You'll have a lovely talk with
Miss Holloway once a week.
- You think she was lying to us?
- About the past? Why should she?
She wasn't gonna tell us about the baby, and later she made that one break.
Admitting it was Mary who told Carmel to go.
Why try to hide it? It was a normal human reaction.
Made me like Mary better, as a matter of fact.
I was getting awfully bored with her perfection.
Why should Miss Holloway want to turn her into a plaster saint?
Maybe she likes plaster saints.
She's one herself.
Thank you, Doctor.
I assure you that when that healthy young man laughs, he isn't being delirious.
Good-bye, Doctor.
- Hello. Come in.
- Hello.
- What news of Stella?
- None, and I won't be having any.
Her grandfather's kicked me out.
Where have you been all day?
- To Bodmin Moor and back.
- Seeing a Miss Holloway.
What, Holy Holloway of
"wealth through harmony"?
- What do you know about her?
- Nothing, except that...
Dr. Rudd, my predecessor, had some sort of prejudice against her.
She says Carmel killed Mary Meredith.
Yes, she was there.
Nursed Carmel afterwards.
- Could we talk to Dr. Rudd about her?
- Only if we have another séance.
- I wonder...
- What?
It's only the very faintest chance, of course, but come on upstairs.
190s to '11, '12 to
'15, '16 to '19.
Here we are.
- It happened in the winter.
- Yes, let's start with November.
From his handwriting, Dr. Rudd must have been 200 years old.
Measles, measles, measles, whooping cough, measles, appendicitis...
Pleasant change for the old boy.
Here we are. "Called to Windward House.
Meredith's model, Carmel
Quesada: double pneumonia."
"Quesada girl much worse. No attempt to warm the bedroom.
- Found traces of snow on the floor."
- Snow? Then the window was left open.
"Spoke severely to nurse.
Returned to Windward this evening. Patient dead.
Nurse Holloway threatened me with legal action... when I used the words
'criminal negligence."
- But that means...
- To a doctor of Rudd's generation... it was apt to mean murder.
- Miss Holloway murdered Carmel.
- Doctor.
- In a quiet, ladylike way.
- Doctor!
Yes, Edith?
The commander's maid's on the phone. You're to come at once.
- Is it Miss Meredith?
- It's the commander.
- Took awful bad, the maid says.
- All right, Edith. You take this home.
There may be some other details.
I'll be along later.
He's in here, Doctor.
I undid his shoes. It was all I knew how to do.
- Bad one this time, Scott.
- Yes, I know.
Hold that under his nose.
Want an apology, Scott?
You'd get it, if you stuck out for it.
No, thanks. I'll have you right in a jiffy.
- Who's there?
- Who do you suppose is there?
Hello, Lizzie.
I'm sitting in your mother's chair, and if any ghost comes along...
I'll let out a scream that will frighten the life out of it.
Why? What's happened?
I feel all the wickedness of this house gathering around.
- Come on, now. Hop off to the Jessups'.
- I'm not going.
I'll be found dead in me bed in the morning... stiff with fright, and me death will be on you.
Me?
How do I know what devilment you'll be up to when me back is turned?
I promise we'll do nothing tonight that the priest wouldn't approve of.
Lord bless you, Mr. Rick.
I was hoping you'd say that.
I'll go and get me hat and coat.
- Find anything new?
- Nothing after that entry.
- How about a whiskey and soda?
- Less soda than usual, thanks.
Awful if we took to drink, both of us.
But it's an ideal house for delirium tremens.
Before you take a sip... don't you smell mimosa?
Yes. Are you scared?
Well, I wish I'd wake up.
It came from the nursery last night.
- You have the great nose of the family.
- Not a trace of it now.
- It's strongest here.
- It's almost overpowering.
I wish you'd tell us what you want, Mary Meredith.
- Mr. Rick?
- Yes?
I forgot to ask: Did you find out anything today?
- Just turned up a couple of murders.
- Holy saints preserve us!
Answer the door.
It's probably Dr. Scott.
- Good evening, Dr. Scott.
- Evening, Lizzie.
- In here.
- Good night, Miss Pam.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- I'm glad to find you here.
- How's the commander?
It's not him I'm worried about. It's Stella.
- What's the matter with her?
- She's at Miss Holloway's.
- No!
- We've got to get her out, tonight.
That's the way I feel, but don't let's get hysterical.
After all, Miss Holloway was her mother's best friend.
The idea of her spending an hour in that place is horrible.
- Can you get the old boy's permission?
- He's too ill. We've no authority.
- Then we'll do it without.
- Shall we take the casebook?
- Might be able to frighten her with it.
- Yes. No, wait.
We'll describe what we found and then pile it on, huh?
Let's get to a telephone.
Yes?
Oh, it's no bother at all, Miss Fitzgerald.
I'll be glad to see you again.
Are you motoring?
In two hours.
Good-bye.
Bring in Miss Meredith.
I may need the car this evening.
Good evening, my dear. Come in.
Sit down.
I thought you'd feel more at home here.
I do, Miss Holloway.
I've been giving your problem the most serious consideration.
It's not much of a problem.
I just want to go home.
To your grandfather's?
I couldn't permit that.
You've never been very happy there.
- Where would you really like to be?
- You mean Windward?
That's the basis of all your trouble, being kept away from there.
- Do you think she wants you there?
- Yes, I think she does.
And what she wants, I want.
I've talked with the Fitzgeralds.
They're very fond of you.
They'll let me stay there with them?
For the present, your grandfather's not to know you've left here.
It would worry him.
You must go straight to Windward.
Is that clear?
Miss Holloway, I'm the happiest person in the world!
There's a train in 40 minutes.
My car will take you to the station.
Good evening. Won't you come in?
- I must announce you!
- Don't bother. We'll announce ourselves.
Good evening. So you've thought of more questions?
- Why didn't you tell us Stella was here?
- The presence of my guests is confidential.
- We've come to take her.
- This is Stella's doctor.
Oh, I begin to understand.
This is a rescue party.
Take me to Stella at once.
There was a time when I would have resented such impertinence... particularly from a doctor whose conduct leaves so much to be desired.
- Please stop beating about the bush.
- I couldn't be angry with anyone tonight.
You know, those moments when the light is very clear... when the scales at last swing into perfect balance.
- Where is Stella?
- Tell them, Miss Ellis.
She's on the train for
Biddlecombe. The 9:20.
On her way home.
- Is that true?
- She'll be there long before you.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
She wasn't very happy here. I can't be of any help to people who are unhappy.
- She went to her grandfather's?
- No.
- Not to Windward House?
- Better than that.
To the cliff, and the rocks below the cliff.
You let her?
That's were Mary went.
That's where she died.
She's out of her mind. Come on!
Stella has a 20-minute start!
The sea has such a lonely sauna.
- Every seventh wave...
- You'd better look after her.
Miss Holloway! What's the matter?
Get out of this room!
I've done what she wanted at last.
Haven't I, Mary?
It's all straight now.
There are no frayed edges.
No loose ends.
All straight.
All smooth.
These local trains are very slow, you know.
But this one had a head start.
You needn't worry. She can't get into the house.
- You did lock the door, didn't you, Pam?
- No, I thought you did.
- Will you be all right, miss?
- Oh, yes.
I'll be all right now.
I'll be with my friends.
Pamela? Rick?
Pamela, are you there?
Rick?
Where are you? Please.
Lizzie?
Is that you?
Stella.
Stella.
Grandfather! Grandfather!
Stella, my child.
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?
Someone telephoned... from Miss Holloway's.
And you walked all that way?
Well, I had to get here.
Don't try and talk, darling.
I'll get Dr. Scott.
Oh, dear. There's no telephone in this house.
- Go. Go!
- You can't be left alone.
But the danger is for you.
- Please get out of this house now.
- Now lie back quietly.
I'm not afraid of anything here.
Then be afraid. Be afraid, for heaven's sake.
When you were a little child... after her death... the evils of this house reached out for you.
I took you away then.
- If I could only take you now.
- It's all right. We're together.
Stella! Go!
- Go...
- Grandfather!
I won't be afraid, Mother.
Stella!
Stella!
Stella, stop!
Hold on, darling.
We've got you now, darling. Hang on.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Sure?
Dr. Scott, Grandfather's in the studio. He's terribly ill.
We'd better get to him at once.
There's nothing I can do, my dear.
I knew.
She killed him just as she tried to kill me.
- My own mother!
- No, Stella.
But I tell you, I saw my mother just as my father painted her.
- It must have been Carmel.
- It wasn't.
Steady, Stella.
Unless...
Unless perhaps Miss
Holloway was right.
Perhaps it's my mind.
- Oh, Rick!
- No, darling.
The mimosa scent... it's flooding the room.
It's all right, darling.
Nothing will hurt you.
But I'm not frightened. This is what
I felt in the nursery that night.
The book!
What's doing it?
- The wind.
- But what about the mimosa?
We're letting our imaginations play hob with our senses.
"11:15 a.m. Mary Ann Hardy.
Broken arm. Second this year."
It's imagination, all right.
- Oh, what did I expect?
- Wait a minute.
"3:20 p.m. Called to
Windward House... to attend Meredith's model, who had fainted.
It didn't take much skill to find the reason.
Girl in poor physical condition... but I'm sure her great happiness will carry her through."
- Then Carmel had a baby too!
- "5:10 p.m. Mrs. Meredith came to see me.
Expected tears, hysteria.
Instead, icy control... and a dominating desire that the girl's condition be kept secret.
I should have more sympathy with the lady if I did not know how she herself... has feared and refused motherhood."
What can it all mean?
- Where were you born, Stella?
- In Paris.
Where they took Carmel before they came back with their baby.
- But surely you don't think...
- I think Mary adopted Carmel's child... gave her a home on the condition that Carmel never came back.
Only she couldn't live up to it.
She had to be near her baby.
But it doesn't fit.
The mimosa scent... that comes with the gentle ghost, that was Mary's scent.
- Stella's father told her.
- No.
No, my father only wrote that it was my mother's scent.
- I'm Carmel's child!
- Oh, Stella, don't mind too much.
"Mind"? Can't you see what it's done for me?
Always there's been something fighting in me... something that couldn't be calm and cold like Mary.
I can be myself now.
That's what she's waited all these years to tell you.
Oh, Mother, now I know.
She's happy now.
- The scent's gone.
- She won't cry anymore.
She's gone forever.
Will you come back to my house now, Stella?
- Come along, darling.
- All right.
- Get her out through the nursery, quick!
- Right.
- What is it, the cold?
- Go on, Pam!
- What are you going to do?
- Help Stella, please.
Mary Meredith, where are you?
It's time somebody faced that icy rage of yours.
What do you want?
It's Stella, isn't it?
It's too late, Mary. You see, we're on to you now.
You told Carmel to clear out and leave her baby, but Meredith wouldn't stand for it.
To spite them, you tried to kill their child and instead went hurtling over the cliff yourself.
Gives your saintly legend a black eye, doesn't it?
So you don't like the sound of laughter, do you?
But that's all you'll get from now on.
I should think you'll be on your way now, Mary Meredith.
We've had enough. We're not frightened of you anymore.
From now on, this house is for the living.
Rick, are you all right?
Let' me in, Rick!
- Oh, Rick!
- You all right, Fitzgerald?
Yes, fine. She's gone, Stella.
Look!
He'd never go near those stairs before.
Bobby'll be back tomorrow.
I think we'll be having other plans for Bobby.
- You're still shaking, Rick.
- Well, I've had a narrow escape.
She might have been my mother-in-law!

Long, long ago,
in a faraway land across the sea,
there lived a little boy
who considered himself
quite an authority on brave,
fearless knights.
And their mortal enemies,
those horrible fire-breathing dragons
that daily terrorize the countryside.
One afternoon as the boy sat
deeply engrossed in his favourite su...
- Good afternoon, Father.
- Oh, son, I seen it.
Up on the bounds it was, all covered with scales and such.
And a tail with a sort of a hook on it.
Now wait until I catch my breath.
It's horrible. That's what it is, horrible.
It's only a dragon, Father.
Only a dragon?!
Oh, the village!
Help! There's a dragon coming! Help!
Don't worry, Father.
I'll have a look at him.
Hello, Dragon.
Oh, now, boy. Don't you throw stones at me or squirt water or anything
I won't have it.
Oh, I just came for a friendly chat.
But if I'm not wanted...
Oh, well, do be seated.
- Well, thank you.
- But if you don't mind...
...the other way, please?
I'll only be a minute.
Have you had any nice battles lately?
Battle?
Oh, no, no. No battles. No.
Oh, probably too busy scourging our countryside and devouring fair damsels, then.
Scourging, devouring?
Good heavens, no.
But don't you ever do anything desperate?
Well, yes, I...
I do make up poetry.
Poetry?
Verses, you know.
Care to hear my latest sonnet?
- Well, I...
- Oh, you'll love this.
I call it "Just A-Drifting."
Just a-drifting o'er the leaves
Like a dewdrop, fancy-free
Playing with the gentle breezes
Romping with the bumblebeeses
Oh, what fun,
Joy never ceases
Just a-drifting
Very nice.
But you're in for trouble, you know.
- Trouble?
- My father's arousing the village.
And they'll be here with spears and things to exterminate you.
You're an enemy of the human race.
Oh, I haven't an enemy in the world.
Too nice to make them.
Prancing, dancing to and fro
Not too fast, not too slow
Where the early birds are seeking
Early worms are slyly peeking
Hear the night owls softly squeaking
Just a-drifting
Hey, what's all the excitement?
It's Sir Giles, stupid.
Sir Giles?
Hooray for Sir Giles.
Hooray for Sir Giles.
Hooray for the dragon-killer.
Hooray for the dra...
Dragon-killer.
Oh, gosh.
It's all out, Dragon.
He's coming.
- He's here now.
- Now, boy.
It's impolite to interrupt a person.
- Who's coming?
- Sir Giles.
On a big horse with a long sword and spear.
You'll have to fight him.
Oh, I never fight. I never did.
- Doesn't agree with me.
- But... But... But...
Now, boy, now, boy. Just run along.
Tell Sir Giles to go home.
I'm sure you can arrange it.
Toodle-loo.
All right, now. All right, off you go.
Sir Giles can't be disturbed.
Sure, he's in conference, he is.
There ain't no one, absolutely no one, can see Sir Giles.
Now off you go. Off you go.
Away with you.
Excuse me, sir. I've come to...
Sir Giles, I presume?
Come, come, come, lad.
Stop mumbling.
- I came to talk about the Dragon.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Another tale of woe and misery,
I suppose.
Devoured your flocks, no doubt.
Oh, no, sir. He...
Made off with your loving parents, has he?
Well, they shall be avenged.
- You don't understand.
- What?
Don't tell me he's kidnapped some fair damsel.
With flaxen hair and ruby lips and form divine.
Why, he can't do that to her.
He shall pay dearly on the field of battle.
But that's just it. He won't fight.
Yes, he...
He won't fight?
Preposterous.
The fellow must be an infernal cad.
Bit of a rotter, what?
He is not. He's a nice old dragon who likes to write poetry.
Poetry?
Yes, you know, verses?
How jolly.
I'm a bit of a bard myself, you know.
- You a poet too?
- Yes.
No doubt you heard of my "Ode to a Fleecy Cloud"?
- Well, I...
- Oh, fleecy cloud
O cloud of fleece
Up in the sky so high
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
But come, come. Let's not dilly-dally.
We must meet this fine fellow at once.
Then you'll explain to the Dragon about the fight?
Yes, quite right. Quite right.
Of course, of course, of course.
Quite, quite, quite.
I'm the reluctant dragon
What ho!
Quite so
The very reluctant dragon
Oh, very, very
Don't you know
They call me the timid dragon
What rot!
I'm not!
I just won't fight
I'd rather play
- I know I shan't get hurt that way
- Hello, Dragon.
Oh, hello, boy.
I'm having a picnic.
- I brought a friend to explain about...
- Oh, well, well, splendid.
The more, the merrier. Now, boy, you sit here and your friend can sit there.
- Thank you.
- Now, let's see now.
Pickles, jam, muffins, tea. Oh, yes.
Here, do have a jam sandwich, sir...?
Sir...?
What did you say your friend's name was?
Oh, that's Sir Giles.
Sir Giles. Well, well.
Yes, you know, the dragon-killer.
Sir Giles, you better tell the Dragon, quick.
Oh, yes, of course.
Hey, you know,
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
The boy here tells me you're quite an accomplished poet.
- Oh, he did, really?
- Yes, yes, yes.
And if it's not too much bother,
I'd be pleased to hear you recite.
Oh, my dear, dear fellow, no bother.
No bother at all.
Would you care for a sandwich?
Thank you. Jam.
Here. Do have another sandwich and a piece of cake and a crumpet and a lolly and a spot of tea.
Thank you.
This... This is called
"To An Upside-down Cake".
Sweet little upside-down cake
Cares and woes, you've got them.
Poor little upside-down cake
Your top is on your bottom.
Alas, little upside-down cake
Your troubles never stop
Because, little upside-down cake
Your bottom's on your top
Bravo. Quite interesting. Extraordinary.
Now, Sir Giles. Tell the Dragon now.
Oh, yes, of course.
You know, I am a bit of a bard myself.
Really? Oh, how nice.
Yes, yes, yes. Quite, quite.
Radish so red
Radish so red
Plucked from the heart
Of your warm little bed
Sprinkled with salt
On the top of your head
Delicious
Oh, that's exquisite. Simply exquisite.
Yes, of course. You're quite right.
Do you mind if I recite a poem?
You, boy? Why... Oh, not at all.
Oh, of course, of course.
Rather, rather.
'Tis evening
From the stars above
A soft mysterious light
Brings thoughts of friendship
Joy and love
Now how about that fight?!
Splendid. Quite.
Fight? Fight?
There's nothing to fight about.
Besides, I don't believe in it.
But dragons and knights always fight.
- That's right, by Jove.
- You can't disappoint the whole village.
- Not cricket, you know.
- Please, I...
I do not wish to discuss it further.
I refuse to listen.
I absolutely will not fight.
Good night.
Well, you know, it's a shame.
It doesn't seem right.
This is really a beautiful spot.
- For a fight.
- Yes, quite right.
Why, I can almost see it.
The flags are waving.
The people are cheering.
- Bands are playing.
- The Dragon appears.
What a beautiful sight, with his scales all agleam in the dawn's early light.
You're just flattering me.
Oh, no, fellow. It's true.
That beautiful damsel throws flowers at you.
- At me?
- At you.
As I ramp and I roar, I cut quite a figure.
Sir Giles has a spear just like this, only bigger.
I get set for the charge and...
Did you say spear?
Yes, spear.
Oh, dear.
No. I'll get hurt. I won't do it. Good day.
Just a second, old chap.
We might fix it this way.
You mean:
Quite so.
But are you sure it's quite honest?
Just a second, we'll look.
Nothing against it here in the book.
No, nothing against it here in the book.
If it looks like a battle,
I'm sure it's all right.
Very well, then, it's settled.
Tomorrow, we fight.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
There's going to be a fight
There's going to be a fight
A fight.
Boy. Sir Giles. Wait a minute.
Oh, wait, please.
Oh, why don't
I keep my big mouth shut?
So the next day, the villagers gathered
to see the valiant knight
engage the bloodthirsty Dragon
in a battle to the finish.
- So I am getting 20-to-1 on Sir Giles.
- That's twopence on the Dragon.
All right, on the Dragon.
Twopence on the Dragon.
You're a smart one.
Balloons. Only a bit for a balloon.
They're amusing, inexpensive.
A nice side seat and a nice side spot.
Here now, mind your step, lady.
Mind your step.
Look, the Dragon ain't got a chance.
Aye, he'll do the Dragon in.
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray!
It's no use.
You might as well tell the people to go away.
I can't do it.
- Oh, but try again.
- You've got to be mad to breathe fire.
But I'm not mad at anybody.
But try real hard. Concentrate.
Not very good, is it?
Nope. Too bad you're not a real dragon instead of a punk poet.
Punk poet?!
Oh, say that again.
- Punk poet.
- Again.
- Punk poet!
- Again.
Punk poet!
- Oh, I'm mad, I'm mad!
- Punk poet! Punk poet! Punk poet!
Punk poet!
Oh, again, again!
Punk poet!
By Jove.
Hooray for the Dragon!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Dragon.
Dragon.
Extraordinary.
Why, he's disappeared.
- Here I am.
- Oh, so you are.
- Am I doing all right?
- I say, old boy.
Stop acting the silly ass, will you?
Help! Oh, no!
Oh, help!
- I say, you hack...!
- No, no stop it!
- Oh, no, stop! Stop it! Oh, no, you can't!
- That's it. Steady now.
- You can't do that!
- Raise the gate. Raise the gate. Hey.
No, no, no. No, fire.
It's horrible, ain't it?
- Oh, no!
- Help, please.
One lump or two? Help!
Don't mind if I do.
- Hey, you vulgar...!
- Help! Help!
Now I'll chase you.
- Help! Oh, no, no, no.
- Hey!
- Help!
- Steady now.
Hey, Sir Giles.
Egad.
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray!
Hooray, Dragon! Hooray!
Hooray, Sir Giles!
Hooray, Dragon!
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!
- Help!
- Take that!
- Horrible!
- Hey, cut it out! No, no, no.
- Help!
- Take that!
- Stop it. Oh, no.
- Stay the game.
The time has come, you know.
- You mean I die now?
- Oh, yes, indeed.
As per agreed, we'll seal our pact, old thing.
Take that!
- Hooray!
- Hooray for Sir Giles!
And so as per agreed,
Sir Giles completely reformed
this ferocious dragon,
whereupon the satisfied villagers
welcomed him into society.
Speech, speech, speech!
I promise not to rant or roar and scourge the countryside anymore.

On behalf of your commanding officer...
...I can tell Mr. José lturbi that this ship's officers and crew...
...are grateful to him for coming here to lead our Navy bands.
Along with every other civilian, it is I who am grateful to you.
And to all the men in the US Navy.
The men who are to be decorated are present, sir.
"Joseph Brady, Gunner's Mate,
Second Class.
"Clarence Doolittle, Seaman, First Class.
"During the action aboard the USS Cruiser Knoxville...
"...these men served their gun until the ammunition was exhausted.
"When by force of explosion,
Doolittle was blown overboard...
"...Joseph Brady, without regard for his own personal safety...
"...dived into the sea and rescued his shipmate."
Acting for the Secretary of the Navy,
I award you both the Silver Star.
- Congratulations, Brady.
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Doolittle.
- Thank you, sir.
To those formerly on the Knoxville, including those just decorated:
You'll have four days leave effective immediately.
Leave your quarters!
The poor little fellows! They gotta stay and mind the ship for the Admiral.
They can't go to Hollywood where beautiful dames grow like oranges.
Where all you got to do is reach out and pick them, right off the street.
- Congratulations, Joe.
- Thanks.
If you visit the studios and see any stars, will you get me their autographs?
Oh, no. After eight months at sea, it won't be autographs I'll wind up with.
- I got plans.
- What kind of plans?
In Hollywood,
I've got a little plan named... Lola.
That Lola, I tell you she's a...
It isn't exactly that. It's a...
No, it isn't that either.
Tell us about it, Joe.
You noticed how different the band sounded with lturbi leading it?
Lola is like that.
In a room with a million beautiful dames, she'd be the one you'd see.
You mean, she's different?
I wouldn't say that. If you like dames, why get one that's different?
No. It's just that whatever the others have, Lola has more of it.
You think she is still waiting?
Dames have been known to wander.
From me? Please, Sailor, leave us not talk mutiny!
Fall in on deck for special leave!
Do you think we can tear ourselves away?
Yeah, but it'll be tough.
"We hate to leave
"We hate to leave
"But when they give you leave
You gotta leave!
"Our hearts bleed for all of you guys aboard
"But right now sympathy's a thing we can't afford!
"We hate to leave
"Without you guys along
We'll grieve and grieve
"But we'll be back
"Yes, we'll be back before we're even missed
"And tell you guys about the countless dames that we have kissed
"Believe us, Mate
"We really hate to leave!"
It's awful for us to leave these guys here in their undershirts.
But we gotta go meet those dames in their soft silk dresses.
Duty is duty! An order is an order!
I know some guys would love meeting a gorgeous gal every night.
"We hate to leave
"When they give you leave
You gotta leave
"No more pinup gals that we so enjoy
"Tonight they're forcing us to meet the real McCoy
"We hate to leave
"But we'll be back before the anchors heave
"We wanna stay, we wanna stay
Our hearts are with the ship
"The Admiral made us take this leave
He beat us with a whip
"Believe us, Mate
"We really...
"...hate to leave!"
But, honey, I saved all of my leave for you!
Why shouldn't I have?
You're the only one anyplace I want to see.
What is he doing wrong?
He's dead, that's all. Watch.
I don't want to meet your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.
I want to meet you.
Well, you'll be sorry!
"You'll be sorry!"
Hello? Miss LaVerne?
Miss Lola LaVerne?
Is this the face that launched a thousand ships?
Yeah, it's Joe, alright.
Doesn't anybody want coffee?
Well, it'll take me awhile to hit Hollywood.
Can you wait?
I know what you mean, baby.
But you just try.
Well, let's decide that later.
After eight months at sea, all I want to do is just look at you for a long, long time.
C'mon! Eight months is a long enough time to wait!
Hello, you beautiful creature.
When you hear the tone, the time will be 6:10 and one quarter.
Buy War Bonds!
Thank you, I will.
Hey, the buses for Hollywood!
"Anchors Aweigh!"
What's the matter?
Nothing. Why?
Where are you going so late?
To join the Navy.
What?
I said I'm going to join the Navy.
- Wait a minute!
- I'm in a hurry.
Take it easy. Where do you live?
- Why?
- I want to take you home.
I'm not going home.
I've just come from there.
What's your name?
Look, it's my job to help lost boys.
"Lost" means not knowing where you're going. I do know.
I'm going to join the Navy.
If that's what you want, but you'll come to the station with me.
I want to join the Navy, not the police.
Brooklyn!
Are you following me?
What's with you? Come on, spill it!
Well, you see it's like this, Joe.
I've been in the Navy a year and a half.
Every time we hit port and get liberty, all I do is go to the library.
So you like books? What's the beef?
Now I want to try something different, like going out with girls.
- Good luck.
- But I don't know how to begin.
Wait. Don't give me that.
After all, you're no yokel you're from Brooklyn.
Even in Brooklyn things can go wrong.
What do you mean?
Right from boy's high school, I went to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine...
...as assistant choirmaster.
And from there I joined the Navy.
I wouldn't tell that to anyone but you.
Sure, I'll keep it quiet.
Look, you want a couple of phone numbers?
I'd be too scared to use them.
But when you mentioned Lola, I thought...
- Are you kidding?
- It's not what you think!
I thought I could string along and learn.
After all, you're the best wolf in the Navy.
Besides, you gotta help me.
You saved my life and you owe me something.
I saved your life, so now I owe you something?
Have you gone crazy?
I didn't ask you to save my life, but you did.
Now I figure you're responsible for me.
Well, I don't.
What's the sense of having your life saved, if you can't have any fun with it?
Look, I got a lot to do in four days.
I don't want you tailing me.
You say I owe you something.
Well, I don't see it.
If I find you a dame and get you started, will you call it quits?
Let me see...
We'll have to do the best with what you've got.
First, fix your hat.
Let me see a sample of your technique.
You are you, and I'm a dame coming down the street. Pick me up.
I'm a dame coming down the street.
Come on.
I beg your pardon, Miss...
Lady, could I possibly...
Give it more pep.
When you're hunting it's how you feel that counts.
If you feel like a mouse you'll get only cheese.
But if you feel like a wolf, nothing can go wrong. You're in control.
One of you has to come with me to the station. Any choice? You'll do.
- Please, let's not have any unpleasantness.
- I'll go with you, Joe.
How can this happen to me just when I'm beginning to feel like a wolf?
The Secretary of the Navy and Washington will hear about this!
Who's in charge around here?
Are you the guy who had me pulled in?
- Pardon me for not getting up.
- What's the charge?
If you've been inconvenienced, I'm sorry.
This young man wants to join the Navy.
We want him to go home.
He won't tell us where he lives...
...but he might tell a sailor.
You want to join the Navy, huh?
Aye-aye, sir.
Attention!
- Name?
- Donald Martin, sir.
- Where do you live?
- 1515 Foothill Road.
My daddy was in the Navy and he said when I was grown up I could join.
And now I am grown up, so I want to.
Sure, Mate, but...
There's a rule in the Navy.
You gotta have a letter from your mother or father saying it's okay.
But I don't have a mother or father anymore.
I live with my Aunt Susie.
Would a letter from an aunt be alright?
Sure. Why don't you talk to her about it?
One of these guys will take you home.
You!
Gotta even be a nursemaid...
Aunt Susie may not give me the letter, but if you asked her...
- You better come, too.
- I can't.
What will I do about Lola?
I guess Aunt Susie must be asleep, huh?
She isn't home yet.
I suppose the door is locked, too.
- But we can get in.
- How?
The way I got out.
Look out for my wagon.
"Dear Miss Abbott:
Donald was a very good boy.
"He is fast asleep, so I went home.
Mrs. Murphy."
I know where my aunt hides the candy.
Wait, will she return soon?
Oh, sure.
"Oh, sure?" How do you know?
Well, she lives here.
Sometimes he talks like you.
I don't want you to think
I'd walk out on you.
But you gotta stay with the kid anyhow...
I got a date with a girl.
That's great! That's dandy!
He's got a date with a girl!
Does he think I have a date with a duck?
Goodbye!
Brooklyn, I'm blowing.
The baby is all yours.
But what about my being a wolf?
You promised me.
You promised me you'd talk to Aunt Susie.
If you don't help me, what will I do?
What will become of me?
Who is he calling?
A girl.
Forgotten you?
Honey, with the picture of you
I've got in my mind?
Why, even across the phone
I can see every...
Look, this is what happened.
I found a kid that was lost...
Joe, I wasn't lost!
I had to take him home. I won't be long.
As long as I get there?
Honey, you know I'll get there.
Look, we better discuss that later, huh?
What are you going to discuss later?
Things. You'll understand when you get older.
Everybody keeps saying that to me.
They used to say that to me, too.
Well, did you understand when you got older?
No.
What can an old aunt be doing out this late?
Susan, don't you wish that you were up there?
I've never heard his voice sound so beautiful.
Iturbi gets so much from a singer.
I'd give anything to work with him.
Cut it! Print that.
Okay, children. You can go home now, and thanks very much.
- How was it for camera?
- Right on the nose.
When will we shoot the boogie-woogie?
Hi, Aunt Susie.
What got you home so early?
Your feet give out?
What?
Dames like you kill me. Don't you ever think of anybody but yourself?
Leaving a little kid alone while you're out having a big time.
Would you mind telling me who you are and why you're here?
Just a guy the police called in when they found this kid wandering around.
Of course, that wouldn't interest you.
So if you'd just step aside...
Don't apologize, just clear the deck!
Come on, Brooklyn.
Hey, Joe, the kid is crying.
Well, if I had to live with a dame like that,
I'd cry, too.
I thought she was nice.
A dame who leaves a kid alone ain't nice.
Wait, please. Give me a chance.
Donald explained...
Okay. You're very sorry.
But we have plans, and we want to get going.
Oh, I haven't any plans.
I thought if you didn't mind you could come back for a while.
Donald is so upset.
It's way past his bedtime.
Sure. We didn't even say goodbye.
Something wrong, Joe?
I thought you'd gone!
- Hey, Sailor, what's with you?
- You forgot about me...
...about what you promised!
You know, the letter!
Well, he wanted to join the Navy.
But I told him about the rule.
The rule about needing a letter from your folks saying it's okay.
And Donald wanted Joe to ask you for it.
Suppose we talk about that in the morning?
If you give it to me now,
I can go right with Joe.
You want me to go with you, don't you?
Well, sure, kid.
But you need other things besides the letter.
Can you read and write?
No, he can't. He plays hooky all the time.
You can't? Do you think the Navy takes dopes?
Not ever?
Sometimes, but even the dopes have to be able to read and write.
No, I'm sorry, kid, it's just no soap.
Joe, now what will I do?
Well, first you gotta go to school and study real hard.
Before you know it, you won't be a dope.
Now, how about going to bed?
I want Joe to put me to bed.
Donald, we can't keep these gentlemen.
They have things to do.
No, they haven't. They're on leave.
We'd be very happy to put him to bed, wouldn't we, Joe?
Thank you, but you've done enough already.
Okay, but no stalling!
Come on, you helper, you!
Hit the sack, Sailor.
Joe! You're coming back to see me.
Promise?
Sure. That's a deal.
All set?
No, I always get sung to sleep.
Look who wants to join the Navy!
Hey, do you think they sing us sailors to sleep?
But I'm not in the Navy yet, so it's alright for me to be sung to.
Where he's right, he's right.
You sing to him. After all, you're the choirmaster around here.
I told you that in the strictest of confidence.
You promised never to bring it up.
"Lullaby
"And good night
"With roses bedight
"Bright angels around
"My darling shall stand!
"Lay thee down now and rest
"May thy slumber be blessed"
- They're asleep.
- Your friend, too?
Well, I made some coffee.
You shouldn't have.
I mean, it's swell, but...
It's nothing.
Is something wrong?
Did you have a nice nap?
- But I have coffee and sandwiches.
- Sorry, we gotta blow.
I have to tell you something, and you won't like it.
Remember you were going to get me a girl?
I've seen the one I want.
But you promised me.
Okay, I promised you!
But I didn't promise you Aunt Susie!
Good night.
But, Lola, it's not that late!
Baby, I know you're tired, but...
What do you mean, it's for my sake?
Well, honey, I wouldn't be disappointed in you.
I couldn't be.
No, no, no, I'm not sore.
I'll be by tomorrow.
Well, alright, if that's what you want.
That's tough.
Hurry up.
- What's the Navy coming to?
- I ask myself that.
I don't want to keep messing up your plans.
We won't have to look for a girl for me.
We've already found Aunt Susan.
Listen, I didn't save your life for that character!
I'll get you a dame that's a dame.
Right now we got to find a place to sleep, so relax.
Shut up!
A couple of empties down there, fellas.
First night's leave?
Do you want to talk?
We ran into trouble with some kid.
And what a kid!
What another kid she had waiting for us when we got home.
Such trouble we should run into every night of our life, huh?
Oh, boy, what a town this is!
How do you like that? I walk my feet off all night and end up with a glass of beer.
You don't live right.
Never in all my life have I seen such dames!
This blonde... Not that there was anything wrong with your redhead...
She was rather interesting.
"Interesting!"
You should have seen the kid work.
I'll tell you, we took the dames home.
A little slow at first...
I asked my girl for a kiss.
She said, "No."
We want the details. What happened?
I'll tell you.
"I begged her"
That's the way he started.
"I pleaded"
You should have seen him.
"I told her, 'Baby, come out of your shell'
"I told her, 'Maybe, you'll find that it's swell"'
What technique!
"I argued!"
I never saw such a stubborn dame!
"I threatened!"
And he's got muscles, too.
"I said, 'You can't send me home
Not like this'
"And I finally got that kiss"
Tell them, Brooklyn.
"She begged me"
True.
"She pleaded"
Got down on bended knee!
"She told me, 'Baby, come out of your shell"'
He was sensational!
"She told me, 'Maybe, you'll find that it's swell"'
Tell them, Brooklyn.
"She argued"
Fought like a wildcat.
"She threatened"
Practically drew a gun on the boy.
"She said, 'You can't send me home
Not like this."'
What happened?
"She finally got her kiss!"
What a time we had tonight.
What a dish! What a dream!
What a dame!
And she lives alone!
What time is it?
It's early.
What time is it?
What happened to that clock?
The phone! Where is it?
Hello? Hello, Lola, honey...
Then who is it?
Well, this is Joe Brady. Where is Lola?
Did she leave a message for me?
Never mind what you'd say!
What did Lola say?
Well, that's too bad about you, too!
Hey, don't hang up on me!
Leave a note. Tell her I'll call later!
Honest, Joe, I can explain everything!
You were sleeping like a baby!
I know you needed a rest badly!
Help!
It's against the rules, but we thought we'd serve you breakfast up here.
After all, you've been through so much.
You must appreciate a buddy like Clarence.
Do you know he wouldn't let anyone make a sound all morning?
We crept around like little mice so as not to wake you. I never saw such devotion!
Don't think I don't appreciate it.
And don't think I won't pay him back.
- I'm sure Clarence doesn't expect it.
- No, really, I don't. I'd hate it.
You poor boy.
Forty-eight days and nights on a raft!
If you want any more coffee just let us know.
- He looks so shy.
- He's so sweet.
Joe, you ought to eat this food.
It gets cold very quickly.
Try the eggs, they're very good.
I left you a razor in the shower, and there's a towel...
You can wait on me hand and foot!
You can polish my shoes and be my slave!
But, Clarence, it won't do you any good.
Because I'm not going to help you with Aunt Susan!
Joe, it isn't Aunt Susan, it's Donald.
You promised him you'd go back to see him.
Why, it's like breaking the word of honor of the whole United States Navy!
I'm not going back to that house!
Look, I get you a date with her, and I don't owe you a thing, right?
Here, take all this stuff.
You'll make an impression.
Let me look at you.
Well, it will have to do.
Now, try, will you?
Won't you come in?
We promised Donald we'd come back, and Brooklyn got him all those toys.
That's awfully kind of you.
Let's put them over here.
Where is he hiding?
Donald? He's still in school.
Thanks to you, he went almost willingly.
Say, aren't you a little young to be bringing up a kid all by yourself?
Well, I'm all the family he has.
His mother died when he was a baby and then his father.
His father left us this house, and that helps quite a lot.
I work and that keeps me from being with Donald as much as I'd like.
I never know when the studio will call me.
Gee, are you an actress?
I want to be a singer. But right now
I'm doing extra work in the movies.
You ever do any singing?
But there are some really great musicians.
There's Stokowski and lturbi and people like that who work in pictures.
There's the chance I might get to sing for one of them.
Any luck so far?
That's awful.
That's terrible.
Thank you, Clarence.
I didn't realize it was so late.
Please forgive me, but I really should run up and dress now.
I'm sorry you missed Donald.
He'll be disappointed.
We didn't come just to see Donald, we...
I'm going to tell her whether you like it or not.
Clarence didn't sleep all night.
Do you know why?
Because he was thinking about you.
I told him you'd understand...
...how it is getting into a strange town when you've been away at sea.
"She'll understand how important it is,"
I told him...
Clarence, do you want to take me out?
Is that what all this means?
- She's a girl with a heart...
- Well, I'd love to.
Honest?
I wish I could make it tonight, but I'm busy.
Boyfriend?
Oh, no, just someone I met at the studio.
He should be here now, so I have to run up and dress.
But you meant what you said about calling you?
Of course. Any night you're free, ring me.
Goodbye and thank you again for Donald.
You know, she's not so bad.
Gee, I'm glad you like her.
I didn't say I like her.
I said she wasn't bad.
Yeah, but coming from you...
Well, if Aunt Susie likes him, he must be okay.
That's a nice car, isn't it?
Hey, aren't you even worried?
Once he takes her out, she'll laugh at any place that we...
That you could take her to.
This means nothing to me.
I'm telling you for your own good.
Once she goes out with him, you're dead.
- You think so?
- Sure.
There's nothing I can do about it.
Brooklyn, there's always something you can do about everything. Come on.
Did you want to see Miss Abbott?
She is dressing. I'll call her.
I wouldn't do that.
Susie hates to be bothered when she's dressing.
Yeah, she hates it.
Something wrong, Jack?
No. Nothing at all.
Then squat someplace, Jack, you're making me nervous.
My name is Bertram Kraler.
Are you good friends of Miss Abbott?
You might call it that.
Are you?
We just met. I'm taking her to dinner.
Maybe you know what you're doing, but I don't think the boys will like it.
I beg your pardon? The boys?
The Navy isn't going to like
Susie branching out this way.
Miss Abbott knows a great many Navy men?
Maybe some she doesn't know.
Say, a dozen or two?
You get aboard a new ship, you don't know a soul.
You're lonesome.
Then at chow somebody says,
"Anybody seen Susie lately?"
Right away everybody is talking about her.
It's kind of homey, if you see what I mean.
Yes, I do.
But, well, she seemed such a quiet girl.
That's not what the song says.
When they sing about her, they never mention the word "quiet."
The Navy has a song about her?
I don't believe it.
Alright, let me hear it.
I don't think so, Bertram.
It's strictly for sailors.
- Yeah, it's not your type of a song.
- I insist.
- Alright, if he insists, let's play it.
- I don't think we ought to.
- Play that "Susie" song.
- You start and I'll find you a key.
"If you knew Susie
Like we know Susie
"Oh, what a gal!
"She's not so choosy
No, not our Susie
"Susie is a lollapaloozie
"When Susie kisses
"It never fails
"When Susie kisses
She takes the wind right out of your sails
"So in conclusion
"Beware of Susan
"Oh, what a gal!
"'S' is for sincerity
"Which she's got none of
"'U' is for
"You know what I mean
"'S' is for
"Sincerity
"Which she's got none of
"'I' is for the Irish in her smile
"Her Irish smile
"'E' is for
"Her eagerness to please us
"That is how she won her Navy 'E'!
"Put them all together
"They spell 'Susie'
"The sweetheart of the boys at sea!
"Oh, that Susie
She's a doozie
- "She's not choosy
- You won't loose-y
- "Don't care who's he
- I mean you-sy
"You'll get woozy
After just one date with Susie
"When you take her home about 10:00
"Another garb is waiting there
To take our Susie out again
- "So, in conclusie
- Beware of Susie
- "She belongs to you and you and me
- And the US Navy"
I don't know what's wrong with him, do you, Brooklyn?
Yes. And I wish I didn't.
Will you tell Miss Abbott, I regret...
Regret what?
What's the matter?
What are you two doing here?
You regret what?
I fear there has been a misunderstanding.
Knowing your tastes, the kind of evening
I planned wouldn't interest you.
What did you say to him?
What's the difference?
I'd like to know what you said to him.
I figured you were stuck with him.
It wasn't Brooklyn, it was me.
Why should you think
I was stuck with him?
I thought you'd be glad to get rid of him.
That you'd be grateful.
You thought I'd be grateful.
Yes.
If I were a dame...
Suppose you were a dame, and for a year you'd been trying to get someplace?
Finally you met a man whose mother was in the philharmonic society...
...who could introduce you to important people like lturbi?
I think it's the meanest and the cruelest...
Don't cry.
Please, don't cry.
Go away.
I'm sorry. I had no right to brush Bertram off without your okay.
Honest, I'm sorry. Please don't cry.
I know you didn't mean it.
But I might never get another chance.
We've got a better chance for you.
That is, Clarence has.
- It's a surprise.
- Well, what kind of a surprise?
He won't tell you. That's Clarence all over.
Do you know what he did before the Navy?
He was the assistant...
Joe, remember your promise!
I can tell her you were in music, can't I?
He was a big shot, too.
Only today he said, "I wonder if meeting lturbi would do her any good.
"After all, he's a friend of mine."
He is?
They're pals.
I once even heard lturbi say:
"It is I who should be grateful to you, Clarence."
Remember, at San Diego?
Do you know what he did?
He called his pal lturbi...
...and arranged for you to have an audition.
Clarence, you didn't!
When? When did he say?
Tell her when.
Saturday. Saturday morning at 11:15.
I'm sorry. It's the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for me.
What did he say?
What did you tell him about me?
Look, I've got an idea...
Clarence has so many things to tell you, why don't you have dinner together?
That would be a wonderful idea!
- You come, too.
- Please do.
You haven't got a thing to do until 10:00, remember?
You came!
You've been in school all this time?
I stayed to tell the teacher what I had to study for the Navy.
She sure doesn't know much.
You kept the teacher until now?
I am taking you to Mrs. Murphy's.
We're going out.
- I'll come, too.
- No, you won't.
But I gotta talk to Joe.
You can talk to Joe some other time.
- When? Tomorrow?
- Sure.
Will you come to school to see me?
- Aunt Susie is coming tomorrow.
- Okay. It's a promise.
Hey, you dope!
You wanted to be alone with her.
Why drag me along?
Because I don't know what lturbi said to me on the phone.
It's a wishing well. Every time I pass by,
I always toss a coin in and make a wish.
Thanks to you I got my wish.
Oh, but should I still toss a coin in?
You better play it safe.
Now it's your turn.
No. My theory is:
"Wishing don't make it so."
You decide what you want, then go out and get it.
Oh, no! Not again! Enchiladas!
What else? Enchiladas for three and all the trimmings.
Now, listen, gentlemen, this is on me.
- You can't spend your money on us.
- I'm not going to.
- Will you wash the dishes?
- Polish silver?
Scrub the floors?
That sounds reasonable.
Now, you stay right here, and no matter what happens, be brave.
- You're set, I'm going to blow.
- You can't leave!
How will you ever get to know her?
Besides, I want to phone Lola.
We have Miss Susan Abbott to sing for you.
"Jealousy!
"You constantly torture me
"I sometimes wonder
"If this spell that I'm under
"Can only be a melody
"For I know no one but me
"Has won your heart
"But when the music starts
"My peace departs
"From the moment they play
"That languorous strain
"And we surrender to all
"lts charm once again
"This jealousy
"That tortures me
"Is ecstasy!
"Mysterious pain
"We danced to a tango of love
"Your heart beats with mine as we sway
"Your eyes give the answer
I'm dreaming of
"That soft word your cruel lips will never say
"I fear that the music will end
"And shatter the spell in the end
"You make me believe
"When your eyes just deceive
"And it's only the tango you love"
- Where's the phone?
- Right up here.
Gee, I thought you were wonderful.
Joe went to make a phone call.
He's a busy guy.
He is the biggest wolf in the Navy.
They call him the sea wolf.
That's what they call him.
Clarence, do you realize that I don't know anything about you?
Other than that you're very nice.
Tell me about yourself.
I'm fine.
Well, what sort of work do you do in the Navy?
Gun crew.
Is it interesting?
Keen.
We missed you.
Susie, it was not bad this time, it was great.
Juan, I have wonderful news.
Guess for whom I'm going to sing on Saturday at 11:15? José lturbi.
The José lturbi.
Clarence is one of his best friends, and he arranged it for me.
Wait! I must tell Mama! I must tell Pedro!
I must tell everybody!
It's only an audition.
It'll be all over the street in five minutes.
Susan, should you tell people?
You have a wonderful voice but...
Yeah, what if everything didn't go just right?
You've given me the opportunity and I want everyone to know about it.
If I fail, it's right they should know that, too.
I guess she's right.
Say, Clarence, why don't you dance with Susan?
Do you want to? I mean,
I'd like to, if you'd like to.
I'd love to.
I only know how to waltz.
That's too bad.
Maybe they'll play one later on.
You know, you two are a strange team.
Clarence is so shy and you're so...
Well, you're a sea wolf,
Clarence told me you were.
Well, dames are crazy about him.
Nice dames, that is.
And not about you? Nice dames, that is?
I'm altogether a different kind of a guy.
I'm never serious about things.
But, Clarence, he's always on the level.
Alright. I know I should have tried, but I didn't.
Okay, so I'm a coward.
I don't know why, you tell me.
Gee whiz, why do I freeze when she looks at me?
What makes people act this way about people?
What makes anything?
"What makes the sun set?
"What makes the moon rise?
"What makes the tide remember to hide?
"And why does it soon rise?
"What makes a star fall?
"Where does it fall to?
"Why does its flight
Make a stop in the night?
"And wish as we all do?
"And what holds a cloud together?
"What makes the sky so blue?
"What makes the sun set?
"What makes the moon rise?
"Is it my love for you?
"And what holds a cloud together?
"And what makes the sky so blue?
"What makes the sun set?
"What makes the moon rise?
"Is it my love for you?"
Gee, you sing just like a bird.
Brooklyn!
Yeah! How did you know?
Flatbush!
Go on! Greenpert!
How do you like that!
Imagine meeting a dame all the way from Brooklyn!
"Ain't it a small world," like my old lady used to say.
Hey, mister, you better sit down.
The manager.
Gee, are you all alone?
No. I'm here with a girl. She's dancing.
Oh, he's my best friend.
Okay. Maybe you know what you're doing.
She's a swell one, that girl, and what a voice.
Yeah, she's wonderful.
She's just about the loveliest...
But you know something?
I can't talk to her.
I can't talk to girls at all.
I never know what to say.
What's wrong with you?
You're talking to me, ain't you?
You're different. You're from Brooklyn.
Most girls are so easy to figure out.
They are?
But you...
One time you look as if you knew all the answers.
And ten minutes later you're just like a little kid.
Just when a guy starts thinking he ought to buy you a doll or an ice-cream cone...
...suddenly you're all grown up again.
I am?
And everything gets all... kind of mixed up and interesting.
I mean, well, that's what Clarence said about you.
He thinks about you all the time.
He does?
Yeah, all the time.
I'll see you tomorrow night?
At the restaurant?
If you don't mind going back there.
I don't mind. It's a swell place.
It has been a lovely evening.
I don't know when I've been so happy.
Good night.
Joe, did you hear what she said?
She has never been so happy.
And if you stop to think for a minute, maybe you'll figure out why.
You mean, lturbi?
Why shouldn't she be happy with that beautiful audition you fixed up?
"All of a sudden my heart sings
"When I remember little things
"The way you dance and hold me tight
"The way you kiss and say 'Good night'
"The crazy things we say and do
"The fun it is to be with you
"The magic thrill that's in your touch
"Oh, darling, I love you so much!
"The secret way you press my hand
"To let me know you understand
"The wind and rain upon your face
"The breathless world of your embrace
"Your little laugh and half-surprise
"The starlight gleaming in your eyes
"Remembering all those little things
"All of a sudden my heart sings"
You have to have a pass to get in, Sailor.
- Does Mr. Iturbi work here?
- Yes.
- I'd kind of like to see him.
- Is Mr. Iturbi expecting you?
- Not exactly.
- I'm sorry but it's impossible.
Look, I gotta talk to him.
It's very important, just for a minute.
There's nothing I can do.
He's very busy, he's recording.
Gentlemen, bar 95, please.
Rolling, Jim.
Stage!
So the Admiral went up on deck and said:
"Gunner's Mate, Joe Brady, what do you think we should do?"
Joe said, "Well, sir..."
'Cause even in a battle, if you talk to an admiral you have to say, "Sir."
C'mon, kids. It's Joe!
- I was just telling them about you!
- Yeah, so I heard!
Where's Aunt Susie?
At the studio.
I'd told them you'd tell us all about your adventures.
Tell us how you got your medal.
Alright, I'll tell you how I got my medal.
Now, close your eyes.
Try to imagine the most beautiful day you've ever seen!
With green grass, singing birds and a shining sun.
- Can you see it?
- Yeah!
Now imagine me walking along playing a tin whistle, as happy as can be.
- Do you see me?
- Yeah!
In those days we wore white suits...
...with blue stripes...
...and a white hat with a little red ball on top.
I was so happy that I ran andjumped and leaped and played.
Just for the fun of it.
I felt good!
Oh, it was such a wonderful, wonderful day.
Suddenly, I slipped into a big hole...
...and fell right to the bottom of it.
I seemed to be in a long tunnel.
Way ahead I could see light, so I started towards it.
Finally, I reached the end and found myself in a strange land.
It looked, well, it lookedjust like a page out of a story book.
And everything was hushed and still.
Like your room at night, after you've gone to sleep.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
No music?
I can't sing if I want to?
Can I dance?
It's a law! It's a law!
It's a terrible law.
"I'll sing and dance when ever I will
No law on earth can keep me still"
Young man, there is such a law.
Our king forbids us to sing and dance.
Wait!
Where dwells this monster of a king whose people may not dance and sing?
In yonder castle, but none can reach him.
"Trust in me, my honored friend,
I'll bring your sadness to an end."
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Just a sailor, visiting you.
- Why are you sad?
- I'm not sad.
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not!
You are!
I'm lonesome.
You deserve to be lonesome.
Lonesome is too good for you.
Passing a law forbidding singing and dancing! Aren't you ashamed?
- I had to.
- What do you mean?
A king has gotta do everything his subjects do, only better.
Well, I can't sing and I can't dance so there had to be a law.
You can so sing and dance. Anybody can.
Well, not anybody that's cranky and gloomy and grumpy.
But anybody whose heart is big and warm and happy, they can.
Try it! Just for a minute, try being happy.
"If you worry, if you worry
If you bother your head"
I do!
"It won't help you, it won't help you
It will hurt you instead!"
It will?
"Grouchers, groaners, cranks and moaners
They're so unfair!"
I know!
"If you can't be gay and merry
Lock yourself in solitary!
"Though it hurts you, though it hurts you
Be a pleasanter guy!
"You may even learn to like it
If you give it a try!"
I'll try!
"You could laugh and sing and dance
As gaily as an elf, but
"Don't expect to get much help
If you don't help yourself!"
- Will you try?
- If you show me.
- I'll show you.
- I'll try.
- You see?
- It's easy.
Look at me! I'm dancing!
What a beautiful story!
And that's how I got my medal.
Recess is over.
What would you like most for a present?
Don't tell Aunt Susie I told you because it's a secret.
She said that you and Clarence fixed it up with a man for her to get a new job.
She's going to make lots of money and buy us all wonderful presents.
What would you rather have than anything?
Well, I'll think it over and let you know.
Don't tell Aunt Susie I told you.
No, I won't.
Joe! Am I glad to see you!
What about you? I got a feeling you didn't get in to see lturbi.
We're sunk! I can't get through that gate!
What do you mean, you can't?
Joe, I've tried and tried but it's no use.
You have to have an appointment!
My name is Joe Brady.
I'd like to see José lturbi.
- Is he expecting you?
- Yes.
- I'll let you talk to his secretary.
- Thank you.
Hello, Jean.
A Mr. Brady from the US Navy to see Mr. Iturbi.
When I watch you I get a feeling that there's something wrong with me.
Brooklyn, you just gotta learn not to get scared.
Hey! I got a pass, Brooklyn! I got a pass!
- I guess everybody's out.
- Okay, let's go.
Can you tell me where Mr. Iturbi's office is?
Sure. Right over there.
Mr. Brady?
I expect Mr. Iturbi at any moment.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
- Have you been at sea recently?
- Yeah, I'm on leave.
I suppose you're having a wonderful time.
I'm Susan Abbott.
Someone made an appointment for me to audition for Mr. Iturbi this Saturday...
Ever speak to sailors, lady?
Hello, Joe. What are you doing here?
Clarence is busy talking with José.
I was waiting for him.
We can go out and have a Coke.
Miss Abbott, I'm afraid Mr. Iturbi...
Jean, tell Mr. Iturbi she'll be back next Saturday.
I'll be back. Tell him to wait for me.
Susie, you almost made a terrible mistake!
I just wanted to ask Mr. Iturbi what song
I should prepare for the audition.
Just what I thought you wanted.
Am I glad I was there to stop you!
Believe me, Aunt Susie.
Take my word for it.
You shouldn't go near him until the minute you're ready to audition.
Why?
If you see him now and try to talk to him, he's polite but he's busy. It's no good.
If you wait until Saturday at 11:15...
He's expecting a big, beefy character.
Instead, you walk in, you're all dressed up.
You look like a million dollars.
Aunt Susie, believe me, you'll kill him!
Come on. I owe you a Coke.
You're sort of Clarence's guardian angel, too, aren't you?
Well, you're always with him or talking about him.
Why?
I figured he needed a girl.
Clarence didn't want just any girl.
He wanted somebody he could think about and write to.
And come home to.
I guess he found her, huh?
What about you? What do you want?
- What kind of girl do you like?
- Why?
I'm just curious.
Well, the kind of girl I like is a very definite kind of a girl.
For example, the girl I know here in LA...
You mean, Lola?
Well, yeah, take her.
Nothing serious about her.
Nothing serious. Strictly for laughs.
If she sees you, great.
If she doesn't, she'll find someone else.
She doesn't tie you down.
I see. You don't want to be tied down, do you?
That's for guys like Clarence. Nice guys.
What I like is...
Yes, what do you like?
I don't know, Aunt Susie. Right now,
I'm a little confused about what I like.
- I have a feeling that everything is...
- Yes?
Back on the set, kids. Come on, Susie.
Everybody works in the next shot.
Joe, why don't you come to the cafe tonight?
You could bring your girl.
Maybe Clarence wants to see you alone.
Call the committee and tell them
I'll be at the camp.
But, Mr. Iturbi, you have be at the studio!
How will you get to the camp?
I'll make it. Tell them not to expect me until the last minute.
Remember, later you have an appointment with Carlos.
Yes, I'll be there. I'll be there on time.
Please, stop worrying.
Give me the Tchaikovsky Concerto and get yourself a chocolate sundae.
- Your next appointment...
- With walnuts.
- How are you?
- Oh, fine.
You tune pianos or play them?
A little of both.
Hey, I know that song.
"Tonight we love
"While the moon beams down in dreamland tonight
"We touched the stars
Love was ours..."
Sure, I like that!
You like Tchaikovsky, huh?
Tchaikovsky, the composer.
You must be mistaken.
Freddy Martin wrote that.
I've heard it on the radio a thousand times.
Well, those fellows... they steal from each other.
"I forgot the words..."
- That's nice.
- I'm glad you liked it.
If I were you, I'd quit this piano tuning.
There's no future in it.
- You play very well.
- Thank you. It's nice to be encouraged.
- You sing pretty good yourself.
- Thank you.
Well, I got to go now.
I have a few more pianos to tune.
Goodbye, Sailor. Thanks again.
Keep plugging.
Señor Clarence! Friend of Susita!
The whole street is talking of what you're doing for our Susita!
- I got a date with her.
- How happy she will be to see you!
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
I must rush and tell her you are here.
Señor lturbi, he is well, yes?
He's well.
Well, look who's here!
And looking like he is at a wake!
Yeah, I got a date with Susan.
Don't you like her?
Sure I like her. I think she's wonderful.
Only, I'll be all alone with her, and I'll sit here like a dope.
I won't know what to say!
What are you worrying about?
The first note I heard you sing...
...I knew you were a romantic fella.
You think I can just walk up to her and start singing?
Of course you don't just walk up to her and start singing. Look...
I'm her.
I'm just finishing dinner.
I'm toying with my coffee.
The fellows are beating their brains out playing soft music.
I'm looking at you.
You're looking at me.
Okay. Take it.
Gee, you're swell!
Gee, thanks.
That's right. That's the way.
"The charm of you is comparable to
"A Christmas tree with toys
"With little girls and boys
"When first they see the tree
"The thrill of you is comparable to
"The thrill I felt when I
"First learned a heart could sigh
"And you were the reason why
"And yet, and yet
"If we two had never met
"I'd know your grace
"That warmth of face
"That only the angels get
"And so comparing you
"With all of these things
"Is all that I can do
"Because they add up to
"The charm of you!"
I'd give a month's tips to have somebody sing those words to me.
Somebody will, Brooklyn.
Some girls, when a fellow visits her, he brings flowers. Orchids even.
I'm the other type.
Me, a fellow brings four bottles of beer.
Why kid myself?
Why are you talking yourself down?
You're a terrific girl!
I better get to work.
Hello, Clarence.
I hope you haven't been waiting long.
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.
Did you enjoy your visit with Mr. Iturbi?
I saw Joe at the studio and he said you were there.
You know, Clarence, I feel as though
Saturday will never come.
- I can hardly wait!
- That's natural, I guess.
Until it happens, I just can't believe that I'll really be singing for Mr. Iturbi.
Susan, I've got to tell you something.
It might change your feelings about seeing me...
...but I've got to tell you.
Please, Clarence, don't tell me now.
I like you very much but we haven't known each other very long and...
Sometimes it's a mistake to say things too soon.
- Do you think so?
- Yes, I do.
Now I feel better.
I was afraid to tell you anyway.
By the way, where is Joe tonight?
Joe probably has a date with Lola.
He's crazy about her.
I mean, she's crazy about him and he doesn't seem to mind it.
That's just to hold you.
Don't forget I got one wish coming.
Let's keep the whole thing quiet, huh?
You know, Clarence, I can't begin to tell you how grateful I am.
It was really nothing...
But I've waited all my life for a chance like this.
- Oh, mister, I'm so sorry!
- It's alright.
Come up to the kitchen.
You can dry off in front of the oven.
Yes, Clarence, you'd better go ahead.
So, I said to myself:
"Half of the year for 18 years...
"...your feet freeze, your hands chap, your nose gets blue.
"Get smart! Get out of town!"
So here I came to sunny California.
My nose don't get blue anymore, but the rest of me is always blue.
You're homesick.
I guess you're dry.
She's gone.
No kidding.
Don't worry. She's probably in her dressing room changing.
With you around, even with the palm trees...
...this feels like Brooklyn.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
The customers are sitting in the inside, and the waitress, she sits on the outside!
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.
- You having fun?
- Oh, a swell time.
All you needed was a girl.
You'd better get back to her.
What are you doing out here?
Listen, Joe, it's kind of tough.
She's so excited about her audition.
Don't you think I should tell her?
That's what I have to tell you. I thought not getting lturbi might cramp your style...
...so I found out we could see him tomorrow at the Hollywood Bowl.
Don't worry. Everything will be okay with you and Susie.
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yeah.
- Mr. Iturbi is in there?
- Yes, he is.
We're friends of his and we'd like to see him.
Sorry, nobody is allowed in there during rehearsals.
I got a dream I dream all the time:
To have a cop say,
"Glad to see you. Come right in."
- So, we give up?
- We don't give up.
We got him cornered.
Where is lturbi?
He just left, and he's eight minutes late.
Even you can be licked, Joe.
We just tell Susan the truth.
Okay, I'll go.
I'll tell her. It's up to me to do it, not you.
I'll go to the studio and tell her it's all a phony.
She'll be sore, but at me.
I'll tell her how I pulled you into it because you're crazy about her.
What's the use, Joe?
Our leave is practically up anyhow.
So what? Susie's not a girl just for a leave.
She is the kind you come home to.
This will do it!
There's something I've been...
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'll meet you at that little bar near Susie's at about 6:00.
That way I can tell you how she took it.
Unless you want to come with me.
Are you just going to sit here?
Yeah... I'm tired.
"I fall in love to easily
"I fall in love too fast
"I fall in love too terribly hard
"For love to ever last
"My heart should be well-schooled
"'Cause I've been fooled...
"...in the past
"And still I fall in love too easily
"I fall in love too fast"
Brooklyn, I love you!
No, you love Susie.
I did, but I don't.
It's awful, but I can't help it. I love you.
I don't think it's so terrible.
Yes, it is.
Joe is telling Susie
I want to come home to her...
...but I want to come home to you.
Gee, I got a feeling...
I got a feeling I'm fickle.
You're going to marry me, aren't you?
Before I say for sure...
...there's something I gotta tell you so everything will be on the level.
Whatever happened before we met doesn't count.
But this was after we met.
It was?
You still don't have to tell me.
I wanna. I gotta.
Last night when I dropped the soup on you by accident...
...it was no accident.
I didn't want you to sit with her.
Why, Brooklyn.
That's just the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
Imagine, you were jealous.
But, honey, you'd better tell your pal to stop fixing it up with Susan.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Because bigamy, I don't believe in.
Can I speak to you for a minute?
What would you like to say?
Perhaps I could tell you.
Clarence is a very fine boy, that I know.
You saved his life, so you owe him something.
You've decided he's right for me.
Does that cover everything?
No, that doesn't come anywhere near it.
I forgot.
You like a very definite type of girl...
...and I'm very definitely not it.
Don't be mad, Aunt Susie.
I'm sorry. What is it, Joe?
Susie, what I want to say...
Well, it's not awfully...
It happens every time I'm with you.
I hear myself saying words...
...that never have anything to do with the things I feel about you.
All I know are the things you say and I don't like them.
Susan, I've never said to you what I really wanted to say...
...because my way of saying it just isn't good enough.
Then there must be some other way.
Sure, there is.
Right out of Romeo and Juliet and The Three Musketeers.
All the books and poems.
Those are the words I want to say.
- But I can't. You'd laugh at me.
- I don't think so.
Well, then I'd laugh at myself.
Words like that don't go with sailor suits and three-day leaves and our world.
They go with the world of cloaks and swords.
If you lived in that house then I could tell you.
But I do live in that house.
If you lived in that house...
...in some other time, you'd be a princess.
And I'd be a bandit chief with a hideout in the hills.
A bandit who had seen the princess once and could never forget her.
Then one night, he'd risk his life to see her again.
Hiding in a shadow here, a patch of darkness there...
You...
Nothing.
It has been a hot day.
Give me a scotch. A double.
Are you used to that stuff?
No, I never touch it.
It cuts down on your wind.
It has been a hot day.
Look, Joe...
No, Clarence! You look.
Sometimes things happen that you can't help, see?
You meet somebody, it doesn't seem like anything and suddenly it is something!
Gee! That's exactly what happened!
Don't I know!
It's wonderful, though.
It could be, but not when you double-cross a pal.
When did you find out, Joe?
Today. But I've had a hunch almost from the beginning!
You did?
It's funny, I didn't. Not for sure.
Not until I kissed her.
Of course, last night when she dropped the soup on me...
...I should have known.
The waitress!
She's a terrible waitress.
You're not sore, Joe?
No, I'm not sore. I forgive you.
Is Susan sore?
No, I wouldn't say she acted sore.
Even when you told her there was no audition?
You mean, you didn't tell her?
What did you tell her? What could you be talking about all this time?
Just things. You know how it is with things.
You're in love with Susan yourself.
You're going to ask her to marry you, aren't you?
When? Before or after she doesn't have her audition?
Iturbi! I gotta get to lturbi!
But where? I don't know where.
Where can he be?
He has to light someplace, sometime!
There must be some place he calls home!
Home!
Can I help you?
We were looking for Mr. Iturbi.
Will he be in this morning?
He gave a concert out of town last night.
When he returns he'll go straight to the studio. Is there any message?
- No. No, thanks.
- Very well.
Gee, that's awful.
What are you going to do, Joe?
Well, I'll go to her house and stop her before she leaves.
Don't let this spoil it for you.
You go see your girl.
You haven't got much time.
I'll meet you at the bus.
Do you want me to go with you?
Joe, I was afraid I wouldn't get to see you again.
I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
Aunt Susie isn't home.
She went to the studio.
I've gotta go back to my ship and I may not see Aunt Susan again.
So, will you tell her something for me?
Sure, Joe.
Tell her that...
...I tried awfully hard to make things come out right.
And that I'm awfully sorry that it had to end this way.
You got that?
- Here's your coffee and doughnut.
- Thank you.
Mr. Iturbi, I'm so excited.
Imagine running into you this morning of all mornings!
I do hope I won't disappoint you.
A disappointment? To me?
How silly of me.
You don't even know who I am.
Well, I'm Susan Abbott.
That's nice.
Your friends told you about me...
Clarence and Joe.
And this is going to be quite a day for me.
It looks like quite a day for me, too.
You know, I expected Joe to be with you today.
But I'm glad he isn't.
That would make me too nervous.
You don't know him very well, do you?
Not really well.
You'd love him.
He's really a wonderful person.
He's Clarence's best friend.
He's Clarence's best friend.
And I know Clarence very well, don't I?
You wouldn't be giving me an audition if you didn't.
And when is it going to be, this audition?
It isn't exactly that I didn't remember...
It's that you didn't know anything about it.
There never was really an audition at all.
Mr. Iturbi, I'm terribly sorry.
Joe and Clarence told me that they had arranged for...
What I mean is that...
It's a joke. I can see that now.
Please forgive me.
Wait!
These boys, you like them very much.
Yes?
Especially this Joe?
- Don't you?
- Yes.
To throw away a friend in anger, this is not good.
Perhaps if we talk about this terrible situation...
...perhaps it will turn out to be not so terrible.
"From the heart of a lonely poet
"Came a song for the girl he adored
"Though she tried very hard not to show it
"She was terribly, terribly bored
"But then the poet asked her if she'd like one
"And her eyes shone
"And the moon shone
"And the stars shone
"Above them
"As they waltzed through the evening together
"They were swaying
"To the music of enchanted violins
"He held her and told her he'd love her
"Till the moon faded above her
"As they waltzed though she tried not to show it
"She was certain she'd fallen before
"And her eyes shone
"And the moon shone
"And the stars shone above her
"As they waltzed through the evening together
"They were swaying
"To the music of enchanted violins
"The spell of the waltz was upon them
"And the stardust sprinkled on them
"As they waltzed, though she tried not to show it
"You could see in her eyes a light
"And it shone with the love for the poet
"As they waltzed through the thrill of the night"
Why not write her?
There is nothing to say.
Tell her you're sorry.
She knows I am.
How does she know?
Clarence, will you write to Brooklyn or wash some socks or something?
You boys were looking for me.
What was it about?
It's too late now.
That I can tell. Come, we'll talk it over.
Come on, I haven't got much time.
- What are you doing here?
- Are you complaining, honey?
Joe, you stay right here.
Today I invited myself to your concert.
And because you might be interested,
I requested Admiral Hammond...
...to grant a young artist permission to make her debut here.
Therefore, allow me to introduce a singer...
...discovered by the US Navy:
Miss Susan Abbott.
In about five minutes
I will introduce a young singer...
...discovered by the US Navy.
"Anchors Aweigh, my boys,
Anchors Aweigh
"Farewell to college joys, we sail at break of day
"Through our last night on shore, drink to the foam
"Until we meet once more
"Here's wishing you a happy voyage home"
Look, Genevieve. Two men coming.
Let me see.
Oh, will you sell it?
Don't you understand?
Wait.
I'll get my father to buy it.
You sit down.
That's it. You wait.
Just a minute.
Oh, I forgot.
He's gone down to the fields.
Well, then, I'll have to buy it myself.
It doesn't belong to me.
Oh, well, maybe Father won't mind.
Oh, well, I can make you understand.
I have fine things.
You trade with me for that.
One, two, three.
Here, look. Very nice.
Look.
Open it.
Open it.
Very funny. Make you laugh.
Oh, my goodness.
Don't be cross. Don't go. Look.
You trade all this for that?
Oh, good!
I'm being very bad. It isn't mine.
Okay, all right.
Oh, goody! It's all mine!
Jill! Oh, Jill!
Go away! Father's coming.
Hurry! Go away!
Oh, my goodness.
Isn't he sweet?
He's better than a doll.
I can play with him.
He has to have a name.
Joe. I'll call him Joe.
Oh, Jill!
I'll surprise Father.
Be quiet.
Won't Father be surprised?
Jill.
Jill.
Where are you?
What's all this stuff?
What on earth?
Jill. Jill.
Surprise, Father. Aren't you surprised?
Jill, where did that come from?
Oh, that's Joe, Father. Isn't he sweet?
Joe? That's a baby gorilla.
Two men had him.
They didn't speak Swahili.
Really, Jill, you should have more sense.
Are you cross?
Well, for a tired man who just found a gorilla in his bed...
...I think I'm behaving very well.
You cannot have a pet gorilla.
Please let me keep him.
Please. I bought him.
How?
What did you have to buy him with?
Money and beads and toys, and other things.
Other things.
Where's my big flashlight?
Well, that makes him partly yours too, doesn't it?
I don't know what to say to you,
I'm sure.
I have worries enough trying to run this farm.
I'm sorry, but you can't keep him.
I will not raise a gorilla.
How the little fella loves his milk.
Does he always take his nap to music?
Oh, yes. This is his favorite song.
- What's the name of it?
- Don't you remember?
It's "Beautiful Dreamer."
Very appropriate.
I think he's grown already, don't you?
Oh, he'll grow, all right.
That's just the trouble.
But, Father, now I have someone to play with.
I know, dear. You're lonely sometimes.
If your mother had lived...
Baby, please try to realize that the time will come...
...when we can't keep Joe any longer.
This will always be his home, and we'll always be friends.
Listen, Jill, when he grows up, he'll be dangerous.
I know that seems impossible to you now...
...but that helpless little baby will be 10 times stronger...
...than any man in the world.
He'll weigh 7, 800 pounds.
He'll be a huge, fierce, dangerous gorilla.
Get me somebody that knows what I want.
Find me an electrician with ideas.
No, no. No, no.
I tell you, it isn't big enough.
Look, I'm branching out into new territory.
I'm building a nightclub in Hollywood.
It's got to be something original.
It's gotta knock them dead.
Take them back to the architect.
Bring me new sketches.
- What about my steamship tickets?
- Mr. Fletcher's here.
Tell Fletcher to wait.
Tell them all to wait.
I gotta shake up my press agent.
I got a letter of introduction,
Mr. O'Hara.
- What do you want?
- I thought maybe...
Well, I'd sure like to go to Africa.
So what? There you are.
Where you been, asleep?
- This is a letter of introduction.
- Half a column on page 20.
- That's good for the Times.
- This is from Tex Wood.
- Two paragraphs on the theatrical page.
- Best I could do.
I want front page!
You gotta get in there and pitch, Windy.
- These guys don't even believe I'm going.
- Can you blame them? I don't believe it.
Max O'Hara going to Africa to bring them back alive.
For what?
Why, there are 50 good animal acts...
...just begging for work right here in town.
Can't I get any cooperation?
Hey, you. What do you think?
Don't you think I ought to go to Africa?
- Why, sure.
- There. There you are. There's a smart guy.
- He agrees with you. He must be.
- This is from Tex Wood.
I don't see why you can't get front-page space, Windy.
We need a new angle.
That's what we need, a new angle.
Hello? What do you wanna talk to him about?
Oh, you wanna go to Africa.
No. No. No...
Say, who are you anyway?
That's a letter from Tex Wood.
Sure. He puts on the shows over at the Garden.
Yes, sir. Madison Square Garden.
Our show closed there last week.
- The rodeo?
- Yes, sir.
- You a cowboy?
- Yes, sir.
- Texas?
- No, sir. Oklahoma.
We rope and ride there too, you know.
I'm Gregg Johnson, champion roper.
All right. Well, what do you want here?
I saw in the paper how
Mr. O'Hara's going to Africa.
Now, there's a place
I've always wanted to see.
You reckon there's any chance he'd take me with him?
Oh, for the love of Mike. Why would he?
We're opening a nightclub, not a Wild West show.
But ain't there something I could do?
If I could just go, I might...
I got it! Hey, what's the matter with you?
What do I pay you for?
- I get all the ideas around here.
- Now what?
Got a new angle. Just thought of it.
It's great. I'll take cowboys.
- Cowboys? What for?
- To lasso lions, of course.
Maxie, you can buy all the lions you want in California.
But I'm gonna send you stories from Africa.
They'll fight to get them.
All you gotta do is pass them out.
Don't you understand? I'm gonna be in terrible danger in darkest Africa.
You're late for the dentist.
Who's the greatest press agent, you or me?
Don't answer.
Hey, you, come on.
You're gonna lasso lions.
- I am?
- Sure. Come on.
Round up some of your friends to help you.
We'll talk it over while I'm at the dentist's.
Who do you think is gonna get the worst of this, Maxie or Africa?
Hey, Ali, bring water for this lion, will you?
- He's a big one, isn't he?
- He sure is.
Just as full of fight as he was two weeks ago.
After you'd roped him, I thought for a few minutes I'd have to shoot him.
Sure glad you didn't.
That's right, Ali, give all simbas plenty maji. See?
Take the machina away.
Away.
Crawford.
Oh, Crawford!
Crawford, where are..?
Oh, there you are.
Look, I got another story to send.
Where's that telegraph office?
At Mdani, about 50 miles.
Have Gregg ride down, will you?
They don't know the way. I'll send one of the boys after they've eaten.
Let's have a spot of tea. Ahmed.
Tea. I hope this never gets back to Broadway.
I hope I never see another horse.
Well, O'Hara, we'll soon be saying goodbye.
You satisfied with the results of the safari?
Oh, sure. Just like I said, I got a million dollars' worth of publicity.
I hope your nightclub will be a great success.
As you've described it, it'll certainly be unusual.
Unusual? Look, nobody's ever seen anything like what I'm gonna give them.
I gotta get back. The date for the opening of my club is all set.
Just wondering if I've overlooked anything out here to make it bigger.
Well, I've read all the stories you've sent back...
...and I really think you've made the most of everything.
Yes, sir.
I sure made the front pages.
Oh, this is a great story I wrote today:
"How I Escaped From Pygmy Cannibals."
Pygmy cannibals? Did you really?
Was that today?
Yeah. They had me cornered.
I'd lost my gun.
They dropped a net over me from a tree.
I was fighting, struggling, but there was too many of them.
They were all over me like ants.
- How do you think I escaped?
- I have no idea.
Did I ever tell you about the mad elephant...
...that seized me in his trunk and flung me one half mile?
I went back afterwards and measured it.
You're catching on.
Hi, Gregg. How about a spot of tea, old boy, as we say in Africa.
Much obliged. I'm getting where I kind of like the stuff.
It took you six months, but you're kind of getting used to me too.
Well, I'm rapidly reaching a point...
...where nothing can surprise me, if that's what you mean.
What's the matter?
Listen.
Sorry, I must have imagined it.
I guess you thought I was a screwball at first, but my idea worked out.
Most successfully.
It's impossible. We're a hundred miles from that country.
- It is! But how can it..?
- What is it?
Ali, my gun! Big gun!
What's the matter?
- What are they saying?
- Darned if I know.
Ali, stop! Come back!
Gregg, get your men.
Slim! Boys, get your horses!
Lay off. No shooting.
Catch it. Rope it.
Are you crazy?
You can't rope a gorilla!
- Hurry up! He's getting away!
- Give me that gun!
You're crazy.
- Give me that gun!
- Don't shoot him.
Wait! You can't rope a gorilla!
Hey, where's my horse?
Stand still.
Whoa, horsey.
Cut it out, will you?
Don't do that! Don't do that!
Can't you cooperate?
There he is!
Where did he go?
He must be around here somewhere.
Hurry up, boys! Get behind him!
Get your rope ready!
Get another rope on it!
Get behind him!
Get another rope!
Look out!
Get behind him.
Get another rope!
Hey, Gregg, watch out!
Hey, Charlie, help!
No!
Hey, come here and help me!
Go on, get out there!
Get a rope on him!
Come here! Help me! Come on!
Where is he?
Don't let him get away!
Where did he go?
Help!
Help! Help!
Joe! Joe!
Help! Help!
Don't shoot! Joe, drop.
Drop it! Don't hurt him.
Don't do that.
Put him down!
Joe, drop it. Drop it, I said.
Help! Help!
- Drop it, I said!
- Help!
Joe, drop it.
What are you doing?
Why, my friend, he was getting killed.
Well, Joe is my friend, and you leave him alone.
Joe wouldn't hurt anybody.
He wouldn't if you treat him right.
Who are you, anyway?
What do you mean by this?
Well, your friend, he came into our camp.
Your camp? If it's within five miles of here, it's on my land.
This is all my property, and you keep off of it, you big bullies.
Come on, Joe.
Come on, I said.
All right, Joe.
Come on, Joe, leave them alone.
Mind me. Come along.
Joe! Come on, Joe, leave them alone.
We're going home.
Am I dreaming or did I see a gorilla and a beautiful dame?
Where did she go? Find out where she lives. I gotta talk to her.
Howdy.
Well, I reckon you're right, but I just wanna see the young lady.
I just wanna talk to the young lady.
I just wanna talk to the lady.
Afternoon, ma'am.
Seems like you always come just in time.
- What do you want?
- I'm Gregg Johnson.
I come to apologize.
With a gun?
Well, I kind of feel safer.
You were gonna shoot Joe.
But, ma'am, he had Mr. O'Hara.
If you hadn't come along, he...
- Oh, I was so frightened. Joe would've...
- He sure would.
If you'd let him alone, there wouldn't have been any trouble.
- We didn't know he belonged to anybody.
- He doesn't belong to anybody.
He lives here. Goodbye.
Wait, ma'am. Mr. O'Hara, the boss, he wants to talk to you.
- He sent me to ask you if it's all right.
- He's afraid?
Well, you can't blame him much.
Please don't be mad at us.
Well, I'm sorry, but you see,
Joe's the only friend I have.
Excuse me for asking, but where's your folks?
I haven't any.
You live here and run this place alone?
It's not so hard.
The servants and field hands all worked for my father for years.
He died six months ago.
I'm sorry.
It's a right pretty place.
I reckon this is my kind of country.
- But don't you ever get lonesome?
- Sometimes.
No, it's my home.
I've lived here all my life.
- It's beautiful. I love it. I...
- Hey, Gregg.
Tell your friends they can come out.
They don't need to be afraid.
How do you do, miss.
That gorilla around here?
Oh, don't worry.
I won't let him hurt you.
- I'm Max O'Hara. This is Mr. Crawford.
- My name's Jill Young.
Pleased to meet you, and I do mean pleased. Gregg told you we apologize?
And I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Don't mention it. Just a little misunderstanding all around.
Everything's jake now, huh?
Have I got plans for you, young lady.
Just wait till you hear.
I'll tell you all about it.
Let's sit down.
Well, come in, but no guns.
- No guns?
- No guns.
Don't you see what a great chance this is for you, honey?
Hollywood.
You must have heard of Hollywood.
- Yes, I've heard of it.
- That's where I'll open my nightclub.
I wanna make you a star.
You'll be the talk of the town.
Everybody'll be crazy about you.
You'll get beautiful clothes, have your hair fixed up. You'll be a knockout.
But I can't sing or dance or...
Who cares about that? All I want you to do is walk out on the stage.
You and Joe. Don't worry about a thing.
I got a contract here, all expenses paid.
With options, of course.
Oh, think of it, honey:
Music, glamour, bright lights, Hollywood.
You'll love it. Come on, honey, sign.
Excuse me for butting in, Mr. O'Hara.
I guess you'll be sore at me.
But, ma'am, you've got an awful pretty place right here.
Maybe you won't like it back there.
Hey, you keep out of this.
Of course she'll like it. Why not?
It sounds wonderful. I've never been anywhere. I'd love to travel.
And go to parties, have beautiful clothes.
You'll meet famous people.
You'll be famous.
Oh, quit rushing her.
Yes, you don't even give her time to think.
Say, what are you guys trying to do, stab me in the back?
That's gratitude, queering my deal.
I'm a square shooter.
I never went back on a contract in my life.
She don't even need a contract.
You take me for a cheap crook?
Think I rob widows and orphans?
I never did anybody dirt in my life.
Never in my life.
- Everybody knows that.
- O'Hara!
Why, my word's as good as my bond.
- Look out!
- Joe, stop!
Put it down, Joe.
Put that rock down.
Be quiet.
It's all right. Friends.
Joe, put that down, I tell you.
Mind me, this minute. Stop it.
Aren't you afraid of Joe?
I sure am, but I don't want him to know it.
I think perhaps you could make friends with him.
It's all right, Joe. Now, calm down.
Behave yourself. Now, listen.
That's a good boy.
Look, Joe, banana.
Will you be a good boy if I give it to you?
A banana, Joe.
Want another one? Here.
Go on, now. Go away.
Oh, boy, what an act.
I gotta sign her up.
Oh, honey, you're wonderful. Sign it.
Go on, honey, please sign it.
It's the chance of your lifetime.
What are you waiting for?
You don't wanna waste your life up in the woods like this.
Let me show you what the real world is like.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Daniels.
- Upstairs.
- And I thought you knew...
...every headwaiter in town.
- Some joint, huh?
- I'll say.
Gee, it looks just like Africa.
That's a good one.
What do you know about it?
Never even been out of the state.
Hey, I sure hope that's a thick piece of glass.
Sure it is, lady.
O'Hara had that made special.
That'll hold anything.
- Let's have a drink.
- You like to try our new cocktail?
- It's called the King of Beasts.
- He doesn't need it.
Shut up, sugar, or I'll throw you to the lions.
Lions are just darling.
I simply love them.
- You know what lions love, don't you?
- No.
Sweet little girls like you.
Oh, Micky, stop.
What do you suppose lions think about?
A drink. Maybe they're thirsty.
Poor kitty. Have a drink.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Who's Mr. Joseph Young?
How would I know?
That's Mr. O'Hara's big secret.
- Maxie's sure got a new angle.
- Yeah, but he never ran a zoo before.
He says these are the biggest lions in the world.
Sure, they would be. Leave it to Max.
- What do you suppose this set him back?
- Boy, suppose it's a flop.
Come on, drink up and go look at the show.
- Maxie, give. Who is Mr. Joseph Young?
- Give us the dope so we can turn in stories.
Yeah, we got deadlines.
Who is Mr. Joseph Young?
- You'll find out. Go on out front.
- Right this way, gentlemen.
The big show is just commencing.
- What's all the mystery?
- Tell us what it's all about.
Yeah, then we won't have to look at it.
- I'm warning you, this better be good.
- It will be. I'll join you in just a minute.
Holy smoke.
Max, I'm sick of keeping my lip buttoned.
This isn't the way we used to put over a show.
Windy, you are looking at the new Max O'Hara.
Dignified, restrained, artistic.
Classy. Go on out front.
You might learn something.
Dignified. Restrained. Artistic.
The shy type.
Hiya, Windy.
All right, Mr. O'Hara, it's about time.
All set back there? Jill ready?
How's Joe acting?
- Just fine.
- Good thing Joe likes you.
He sure does. I can handle him darn near as well as she can.
Your attention, please.
The one and only Max O'Hara.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...welcome to the Golden Safari.
I know you have all read of my exciting adventures in darkest Africa.
But I have never given out the story of the most wonderful experience of all.
That was the moment when I first met, face to face...
...the gentleman I am about to introduce to you.
But first you must meet his lifelong friend.
It is my privilege to introduce this charming young lady.
It is she alone who can completely control the amazing power...
...of the personage whose name appears in lights outside.
If you please.
This tune is an especial favorite of Mr. Joseph Young.
For the love of Mike, what's this supposed to be?
- Has Max gone nuts?
- Give it a chance, fellas. Give it a chance.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Joseph Young of Africa.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I thank you for your applause.
Here you see 10 men.
I have combed the country to find these men.
Let me introduce them.
First, Sammy Stein.
"Killer" Karl Davis.
Rasputin, the Mad Russian.
"Bomber" Kulky.
- "Slamming" Sammy Menacker.
- That's my boy!
- Max, the Iron Man.
- Wow, what a man!
- "Wee" Willie Davis.
- Look, he's got fur!
"Man Mountain" Dean.
The Swedish Angel.
The former heavyweight champion of the world...
...Primo Carnera.
Just look at them.
Every one a champion.
Look at those brawny arms, those massive chests.
I ask you, is there one creature in all the world...
...powerful enough to overcome that combination?
That is the question to which we seek an answer.
That is the test we are about to make.
When I give the signal, the fearless little lady...
...will bring my friend,
Mr. Joseph Young...
- My friend...
- Joe, stop it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.
Here, Joe, take it.
Now, boys, pull it.
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull.
Pull, Joe, pull. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull!
Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe.
Pull harder, Joe. Pull, Joe. Pull.
Pull, Joe. Pull!
Pull, Joe.
Joe, what are you doing?
Pick it up.
Pull, Joe.
Pull.
Help! Help! Let me go!
Help!
Let me down!
Let me down!
Go on, fella, get in.
Poor old boy.
Sorry I have to lock you up.
Well, Joe, I don't like it any more than you do.
But I reckon that's the way it's gonna be.
- Hello, where are you going?
- Jill's tired. I'm taking her to the hotel.
Jill, honey, everything turned out like I promised, huh?
- You're on top of the world.
- How..?
How long do you think you'll want us?
Don't you worry about that.
Your contract's good.
You and Joe will be working for me from now on.
Take good care of my little star, huh?
Well...
...that sounds like a long time, doesn't it?
Yeah, it sure does.
How big is he? How big is he?
How big is he?
Give me your autograph.
- That girl from Africa.
- The one with the gorilla?
Hey, how about a pass to the show?
Miss Young, my name is...
I'd like to get a pass to the show.
Go on, eat your dinner.
Lost your appetite, haven't you?
Guess I have too.
Poor old Joe. I don't blame you.
- Hello. Been mobbed again?
- Yes.
Mr. O'Hara said he'd make you famous.
- How's Joe today?
- He won't eat.
I was so stupid. I never realized he'd have to live in a cage.
Too bad.
Guess he's just too big for them.
My poor Joe, he's so unhappy.
That sign outside...
...I know just how he feels.
Ten weeks. It seems like 10 years.
Please don't cry, Jill.
Come on upstairs to O'Hara's office.
We've had enough of this.
Hello, children, come on in.
Well, we sure struck gold in California.
Business is great.
What can I do for you?
Jill's quitting.
Mr. O'Hara, Joe and I are going home to Africa.
- Are you crazy?
- Max, you talk too much.
- Now she wants more dough.
- No, it's got nothing to do with money.
- I want to take Joe back home.
- But you can't. You signed a contract.
You know that contract's no good.
She's underage.
- Hey, maybe you put her up to this.
- You keep out of this, Windy.
Look, honey, you can't do this to me.
You're throwing away good money.
You're breaking my heart.
I'm a square guy.
I told you I'd make you a star, that you'd have beautiful clothes.
You're famous.
You're all dressed up.
- I kept my promise, didn't I?
- Mr. O'Hara, I'm sorry.
I don't wanna seem ungrateful.
You've been very kind.
You think all this is wonderful.
I thought it was going to be too.
But Joe can't live in a cage, and...
...neither can I.
- Oh, honey, talk sense.
It is sense. We're not going to kill Joe.
Well, all right, if that's the way you feel, but...
But you'll give me a little time.
I mean, I've got to get another act to take your place.
I've got to protect my investment.
You wouldn't just walk out on me.
Why, of course, I...
I want to do whatever is right.
Sure you do. Now, I'm gonna take you out and buy you a swell lunch.
Just to show you there's no hard feelings.
I knew you wouldn't let old Maxie down.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Just don't rush me...
...and everything's gonna turn out all right.
You want to go,
I wouldn't try to talk you out of it.
I'd be the last person in the world that would ever...
- What's that?
- Big money for the big monkey.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...when the music starts again, start throwing your money.
One table has a lucky number.
If Mr. Joseph Young picks it up...
...it means free champagne. Ready?
Pick it up.
Pick it up, Joe.
Your cap, Joe. Take off your cap, Joe.
Stop! Stop!
Curtain.
- Who got the lucky number?
- The monkey never even picked it up.
It's a gyp. O'Hara stopped the act so he wouldn't have to give away a drink.
Cigars? Cigarettes?
Hi, babe. Sit down, join the party.
No, thank you, sir. Cigars? Cigarettes?
- Come on, sit down.
- I can't do that, sir. Cigarettes?
But, look, you've ruined my...
- Say, I'll have to pay for these.
- Shut up. Get out.
- Go on, scram. Get out.
- Run along, kid. It's okay.
Listen, you guys...
...cut out the rough stuff or I'll throw you to the lions.
Kid's cigarettes will be on your check.
Enjoy yourselves, gentlemen.
- Who does he think he is?
- Insulting us.
- This joint's dead. Let's get out of here.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I got a great idea. Wait a minute.
- I wanna have some fun.
Let's buy a drink for the big monkey, huh?
- Where's O'Hara?
- Don't worry about him, he's gone.
Come on, everybody bring a bottle.
That's a great idea.
That grouch O'Hara, let's show him we can have some fun.
Poor old monkey.
Bet O'Hara never bought him a drink.
Come on, follow me.
- You better eat something.
- I can't.
How could I let Mr. O'Hara talk me into doing that new act tonight?
He's a fast talker.
Think of me letting Joe stand up there...
...and be a target, a clown...
...for all those awful people.
I'll never do it again.
You bet you won't.
That's too dangerous.
There, you see?
I told you I could find him.
Look at him, very sad.
- He isn't having any fun.
- He needs a drink.
Make him feel good, like us.
Come on, fella. Won't you..?
Won't you join us, Mr. Young?
It's good for you. Forget your troubles.
Come on, that's a sport.
This is good stuff.
Watch me.
Good. See?
Now you take it.
Come on. Don't you wanna feel good?
Try it. It'll grow hair on your chest.
That's a boy. Come on, that's it.
- You think he'll like it?
- Of course he'll like it. Just what he needs.
Come on, try it.
He doesn't know what to do with it.
Hey, chum, watch me.
He caught on. Look at that, he drinks like a gentleman.
- Look at him pour it down.
- He likes it, all right.
Here's looking at you, Mr. Joseph Young.
- Wants more.
- Why don't you give it to him.
- I gave him mine.
- Okay, big boy.
- We're showing him a good time.
- Sure. We're good sports.
And Mr. Young's a good sport.
That's right, Mr. Young.
- Look at that, two bottles.
- Can you imagine the size of his hangover?
Oh, brother.
What a headache he's gonna have.
I'd like to see O'Hara throw him out.
Please stop worrying.
I won't let O'Hara talk you out of it.
Just to make sure that he doesn't, I'll stand on the pier until your ship is out of sight.
That's wonderful.
I wish I could make Joe understand we're really going home.
But aren't you coming too?
But if you don't, that would spoil everything.
You're always saying what a wonderful place my farm is.
You mean you don't want to go back.
Listen, Jill, you can't go around asking guys to go to Africa with you.
I don't. I'm asking you.
Well, of course I wanna go any place you go...
...but I didn't figure you felt like that. Do you?
Of course I do.
Great day in the morning.
Excuse, please.
Jumping catfish, what a thirst.
- Don't you wish you could do that?
- He's just a hog.
He doesn't leave any for us.
That's gratitude.
I'll bet you he could drink up all the liquor in this joint.
Well, I'm not gonna buy him any more.
He's drunk. Disgusting.
Listen, Mr. Young, if you can't handle your liquor, you shouldn't drink.
You drank all our good liquor, you big moocher.
- You ought to be ashamed.
- What, again?
- No, lay off, will you?
- You drank it all.
I'll teach you.
Drink all our liquor, will you?
He'll get out!
- Look out!
- Help! Help!
He's out! He's out!
Look out! Look out!
Help!
Get out of the way!
Please, don't rush! Please don't panic.
Take it easy, will you? Don't run.
Take it easy, folks.
Help!
Help! Help!
- What's happened?
- Joe's loose. He's gone crazy.
- Help me get in.
- Come on.
That ape tried to kill me.
Hear that? Police.
- They'll shoot Joe.
- Keep them out. Give me just a minute.
Joe! Joe!
Stop it!
Stop it, Joe!
Stop that, Joe. Come on.
Come on, Joe.
Please get up, Joe.
All right, break it up! Break it up!
Wait a minute, boys.
Take it easy, will you, fellas?
- Out of the way!
- Wait a minute.
Hurry, Joe.
Shooting the lions!
Joe.
Oh, no.
Your Honor...
...I’m not unsympathetic to Miss Young.
But in view of the destruction and panic already caused by this dangerous animal...
...I cannot allow sentiment to influence me.
Again, I submit that the court order should be carried out.
I'm very sorry, Miss Young, but he must be shot.
He'll never break out again, lady.
Them new bars will hold anything.
Joe...
There isn't anything I can do, Joe.
I tried.
They wouldn't listen.
Gregg and I were gonna take you back home.
It was nice back there at home, wasn't it?
Nobody hated us.
Nobody wanted to kill...
Now, lady, you don't wanna act like that.
You don't wanna be down here when they come to shoot him.
Look, you go and find O'Hara and the young fella.
They're likely upstairs in the office.
Go on, now.
That's a good girl.
Well, it's after 8:00.
Where's Schultz and his court order?
- I don't like this job much.
- It's just like shooting a mad dog.
Well, let's get it done.
I got a date tonight.
Chin up, kid.
Max has a scheme.
I don't know what, but we're not licked yet.
- But where did they go?
- I don't know.
But you can count on Max.
Those men are coming.
They'll shoot Joe.
- We've got a plan, Jill.
- We'll get Joe out.
- Get him out of the state?
- Out of the country.
- Joe's going back to Africa.
- You mean it?
Listen, honey.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
If Joe gets shot, it's my fault.
You and Joe don't belong here.
I talked you into this.
It's up to me to get you out.
I'll get you back home if I have to go to jail for it.
We paid the captain of a freighter down at the harbor.
He promised us not to sail till 6:00 in the morning.
How will we get Joe out?
There's police there.
I've got a plan.
It will take split-second timing.
We've all gotta work together.
Now, listen...
Hello, Moran.
Just came down to take my last look at poor old Joe.
Okay by me.
Just keep that girl out of here.
They'll be here to shoot him in a minute.
Too bad.
I got a lot of money tied up in you.
Goodbye, Joe.
I should have left you in Africa, where you belong.
The old heart. Help me.
Help.
Upstairs. My office.
Easy, now. Easy, now.
You'll be all right.
My office.
- My medicine.
- Take it easy, I've got you.
Good evening, O'Hara.
What's the matter, Moran?
- Why aren't you guarding the ape?
- He took sick. I had to help him.
- My heart. Sit down.
- No thanks.
- Here's the court order. We'll do the job.
- No, don't go. Wait.
- I got a date.
- I haven't read the court order.
Nothing wrong with it.
- You coming?
- No, my heart. The strain.
- Come on.
- Let's go this way. It's shorter.
This won't take long.
Getting kind of careless, aren't you, Moran?
Hey, he's gone!
Hurry, Joe, get in.
Hey, you, stop!
They got into a white van.
Get to a phone! O'Hara's office.
Schultz wants you up in my office.
Right in here.
O'Hara!
Police headquarters.
Operator. Police headquarters.
Operator, wake up! Wake up!
Schultz, here's a tip-off.
A map of Las Vegas.
- They're getting out of state.
- Here I am.
- O'Hara said you wanted me.
- O'Hara?
Operator. Oper...
- I'll get that guy! Get to a phone.
- Get to a phone.
O'Hara ought to catch up along here somewhere. Watch out for him.
Hey, take a look at this.
Get to a phone.
Turn in a general alarm.
Hold it. I hope the kids made it.
I'll take a look.
Here they come.
So long, Windy. Be seeing you.
- Step on it, Gregg.
- I gotta get some air in that front tire.
Give us some air in the left front.
Got a slow leak.
- You want I should change your wheel?
- No, I'm in a hurry.
Yeah, in a big white van, probably heading for Las Vegas.
Calling all cars. Escaped gorilla in large white van headed north.
Animal very dangerous. Shoot on sight.
Fine, it worked.
They think we're headed north.
- What happened? What was that?
- I don't know, but Joe's all right.
- Okay, Schultz, we go north, huh?
- Those roads are well covered.
That map may be one of O'Hara's tricks.
We go south.
- What you got?
- One for the tank, sarge...
...and has he got the horrors.
Running up and down the road, yelling like a banshee.
Take him back.
I'll book him when he's sober.
Now, hold on. That's my old man's lingo.
Get me headquarters.
Captain O'Toole?
This is Obrinski.
Yeah, we just got a report on the gorilla.
This is the real thing.
Calling all cars. Escaped gorilla reported at service station...
... Duane and Tilford.
Hey, that's not far from here.
Repeat. Escaped gorilla reported at service station, Duane and Tilford.
They got us spotted.
They know we're headed south.
What will we do?
Look out!
What do you think you're doing?
Wanna get us all killed?
- Who you yelling at?
- Get off of the road.
You asked for it.
- I'll move the truck.
- Jill, get Joe out.
- What's the idea?
- How much gas has he got?
Oh, I get it. Half a tank.
- Help Jill.
- Right.
- Hey, you seen a big white van?
- Sure did.
- There's something funny about it.
- Going south?
- Yeah.
- That's it.
Hurry, Joe. Hurry!
Get in, Joe. Get in.
Take that road.
It's the back way to the harbor.
I'll see you at the ship.
I hope so.
There it is.
- O'Hara. What are you doing here?
- Was I going too fast?
Come out of there. You thought you'd put one over on me, didn't you?
This is a great indignity.
I demand an explanation.
- Shut up. Open those doors.
- Wait! What are you going to do?
- Shoot that gorilla.
- It's empty.
- Don't open it.
- Get out!
Don't open it. You'll be sorry.
You'll be sorry. You'll get hurt.
Ready, boys? Open the door.
Hey, where's my truck?
Somebody stole my truck.
You smart aleck.
You got the gorilla in a truck.
- What you talking about?
- Where are they?
- Not your business.
- Come!
- Want him too?
- For what?
O'Hara, you're obstructing justice.
Where's that gorilla?
You better start talking, O'Hara.
- I think I'm gonna have a heart attack.
- Fine, have it in there.
Turn around. Back to that crossroad.
That's where they went.
I wonder how long Mr. O'Hara can hold them.
I don't know, but we better get off this road.
I wonder where that fool thinks he's going.
Hang on!
Get out, Joe.
Come on, Joe, push!
Like this, Joe. Push!
- A truck just went down there.
- That must be it.
Push, Joe! Push!
Here they come.
There's the gorilla. Shoot!
Get in, Joe!
- No, you'll hit the girl!
- Get the tires!
- Come on, you, push!
- I will not.
Go in.
Two more. Two more children upstairs.
Jill!
Jill!
Children, where are you?
Jill!
Gregg!
Gregg!
Get to the roof.
Joe!
Joe!
Joe! Joe!
Joe, in here.
Joe!
Gregg!
Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
Look!
Go back, Joe. Go up.
There's a baby up there, Joe.
Go up, Joe. Joe, go up.
My poor Joe.
It's all right, kid. There's nobody in the world gonna shoot Joe now.
No, no, no. It isn't big enough.
Max O'Hara, I didn't know you were back in New York.
Read the paper.
I've been back for months.
Hi, Max. I got 200 girls for you to look at.
They'll be at the pool tomorrow, 10:00.
- They all gotta swim like fish.
- Sure.
It'll be the greatest water show.
Singers, dancers, jugglers, acrobats...
...all in the water.
- I can get you a great act.
- It could work on a raft.
- What?
- Monkeys.
- Nix. Cut it out, will you? See you later.
- Hey, what is this?
- I got a big surprise for you, Maxie.
What is it? Hurry it up.
I got a million things to do.
You've got time for this.
Wait till you see it.
Hey.
Look at that.
The kids told me to spring it on you.
Crawford took it.
He went up there to visit them.
Hi, Jill.
Hello, Max.
Hey, they said, "Hello, Max."
And they lived happily ever after.
I sure hope so.
They will. They're back home where they belong.
Ma! Mary! All ready?
First bell's a-ringin'.
Yes, we're all ready.
Mary's comin' through the back door.
Now, son, cheer up.
We're all healthy, and we've still got meal in the barrel.
Look at that sky.
Big cracks in it like it was ice on the mill pond... a-crackin' up to show us spring's a-comin'.
If that ain't enough for a God-fearin',
New Hampshire family, I want to know.
- Oh, Jabez! Help!
- Coming!
- [Growling, Barking]
- Quiet, Shep! Quiet!
- Down, Shep! Down!
- He only wants you to throw a stick for him, Jabez.
I guess he's feelin' the spring air comin', too.
All right.
- Get it, Shep!
- [Barking]
- Mary? Jabez?
Comin', Ma. What's the matter?
Anything wrong with me?
- No, nothing.
- Then what's the smile on your face for?
Now, Jabez. You've got a clean shave, and I've got on my Sunday best... and I'm going to church with my husband.
Almost the first time since the beginning of winter.
- And if that isn't an occasion -
- I don't know what is.
- [Barking]
- [Squealing]
Now, what the dickens?
Shep! Come here, Shep!
- [Barking Continues]
- [Squealing Continues]
Shep! Shep, stop it!
Leave that pig alone!
Come here, Shep!
- Jabez, what's the matter?
- I don't know.
Something's wrong with the pig.
- Quiet, Mr. Porker.
- [Pig Shrieks]
He's worse than a greased pig at the county fair.
Yep, his leg is broken.
Get me the box, Mary.
I remember Dad used to say...
"When they were handing out hard luck, the farmer got there first."
Now, Jabez.
Don't you remember your own wedding?
We said it's for better or worse.
We said it's for richer or poorer.
- That's what we said.
- Oh, your pants! They're soaked.
- Let me take them.
- Oh.
Well.
- Guess we won't be goin' to church today.
- [Mary] I guess we won't.
Anyway, I can read you from the Good Book.
There won't be any objection to that.
Now you won't catch cold.
Ha! I call that coddlin' a man.
Now, Ma. Seems to me you used to do it for Dad, too.
Well, always did my duty.
Mary, hold the splint tighter.
"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright -"
Consarn the consarn -
Jabez! What kind of talk is that on the Sabbath, and me a-readin' the holy word?
Sorry, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
Hard luck, like me.
Now, Jabez Stone, as for what you're calling hard luck... we made New England out of it - that and codfish.
There. That'll hold him.
That's nice and warm for you.
Don't get him too close to the fire, or we'll have roast pork for supper.
- Not on Sabbath you won't.
- You didn't really think
I'd forget, did you?
Give me the book, Ma.
I'm going to read us something cheerful from the Book of Ruth.
- That is, if you don't mind changing the lesson.
- Land sakes, I don't mind.
I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture.
He took on too much to suit me.
'Course I don't want to malign the man... but he always sounded to me like he come from Massachusetts.
Yes, Mary.
You go ahead and read.
- "And Ruth said in -"
- There's a rig turnin' into the gate!
- Who is it?
- It's Tom Sharp and two other fellas.
Well, let's, uh, let's see what they want.
- Jabez!
- Oh, Glory! My pants.
[Knocking]
- Mornin', Mary.
- Mornin', Tom. Come in.
- Mornin', ma'am.
- There's a mat there to wipe your feet on.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I plumb forgot.
- Howdy, Jabez!
- Howdy.
- This is Van Brooks, Massachusetts.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
- This is Eli Higgins. He's Vermont.
- Howdy.
- There's a mat there to wipe your feet on.
- Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Come over to the fire. Sit down.
- Little pig hurt himself?
- Yep. Broke his leg.
Hmm. Too bad. Had a pig one time broke all four legs.
Yep. Spoiled all the hams.
You may smoke on Sabbath in Massachusetts, but not here.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Rains kinda hard in New Hampshire, don't it?
How's the year been in your part of the country?
Well, had a good stand o' corn.
Comin' along right nice... and then we had a hailstorm - a hailstorm in June.
Hailstones so mighty, the chickens got to settin' on 'em, thinkin' they was eggs.
Yep. Makes you wonder what in tarnation
Providence was thinkin' about.
That ain't nothin'.
We had a snowstorm in August.
- In August?
- Yeah. Much obliged, ma'am.
It was so cold, a man got out in it, and it froze him solid.
- All except his heart.
That was frozen already.
- Loan shark, eh?
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
- Are you one of old
Stevens's customers, too?
- Sure am.
It's the debt and the lien and the mortgage.
Quite a problem to us farmers nowadays.
City folks has their troubles, too... but when a farmer goes bankrupt, he can't crawl out so easy.
Laws oughta be changed somehow.
We oughta have more consideration.
That's the reason the three of us met up together, Neighbor Stone.
Yep.
Farmers oughta have a sort of grange, as they call it in Vermont.
[Tom] What do you think, Jabez?
Sound reasonable to you?
Well - Sure does, but I'll, uh...
I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
That's fair enough.
Man's got a right to mull things over.
Mighty fine pie you got here, ma'am.
- Would you like another piece?
- I sure would.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Oh, Ma. I thought we'd save that for tomorrow.
It's the Lord's will to feed strangers... even if they eat you out of house and home.
Well, you read this, Jabez. We'll drive around again in a week or so.
I was just thinking... that, uh, they might not like the idea down in Washington.
Why not? There's a bill up in Congress now... to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy.
- Daniel Webster's fighting for it right now.
- Black Daniel?
Yep. Biggest man in the whole United States.
Senator from Massachusetts. He's gonna be our next president, sure enough.
I know. They say when he speaks, the stars and stripes come right out of the sky.
[Whispering]
Listen, Black Daniel.
You're only wasting your time writing speeches like that.
Why worry about the people and their problems? Think of your own.
You want to be president of this country, and you ought to be.
Inauguration day parade, bands playing, prancing horses... sun shining on the Stars and Stripes waving in the breeze... crowds cheering,
"Daniel Webster... president of the United States of America."
Don't be a fool. If you go on with that speech, you'll never be president.
Be still!
"I would say to every man who follows his own plough...
"and to every mechanic, artisan, and laborer in every city in the country-
"I would say to every man, everywhere...
"who wishes by honest means to gain an honest living...
'Beware of wolves in sheep's clothing."'
"The insolvent farmers cannot even come to the seat of their government...
"to present their cases to Congress... so great is their fear that some creditor will arrest them in some intervening state."
"We talk much and talk warmly of political liberty...
"but who can enjoy political liberty... if he is deprived permanently of personal liberty?"
"If the final vote shall leave...
"thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress...
"can we, members of the government...
"go to our beds with a clear conscience?
"Can we, without self-reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy... to forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors?"
- That's wonderful language
Mr. Webster uses there.
- It would move a stone.
If it would only move Old Miser Stevens.
We've still got to pay him.
- Yep. Can't get around that mortgage. I'm sorry.
- It's all right, Sheriff.
I wish I could really do something for you, but you know Stevens.
- He'll throw you off the farm if you don't pay him tonight.
- He would!
The law's the law.
Good-bye. Good-bye, Mary.
- Bye, Sheriff.
- Bye, Sheriff.
- Well, what are we going to do?
- We've still got my butter money.
- Your butter money?
- Do you think I'm grudging it?
- Mary, it's gone.
- All of it?
All of it. I had to pay the vet in full. He wouldn't have treated the horse this time.
After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
That's all right.
We'll find something to pay Stevens.
If the pig hadn't broken his leg, we could have taken him.
Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
You always said the field uphill needs a rest.
- But if you think-
- I'm a farmer, Mary. Always will be.
To me, seed isn't a thing to pay debts with.
It's alive - more alive than anything.
But I guess you're right.
We just got to do it.
Jabez, you ought to talk to Tom Sharp about joining the grange.
- I will, Mary.
- [Ma]Jabez.!
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
I just figured you didn't have any money.
Yes, and you figured right, consarn it!
That's a word you're too free with lately.
Consarn this and consarn that.
But it helps sometimes to say it, Ma.
All right, son, if it helps.
Jabez! What's this?
- Seed alone won't do it.
We'll have to throw the calf in.
- But we were countin' on it.
- Get up on the wagon.
- [Cow Moos]
- His mother's bawlin'.
- I can't help that.
It's such a lovely calf.
You're right, Mary.
It's a fine calf.
That's why old Stevens will take it for the rest of the payment.
[Screams]
- [Groaning]
- [Barking]
- Mary! Are you hurt?
Ma! Quick!
Mary fell down!
- Ma.!
- Carry her into the house. Be careful.
No, no, no. Put her down here.
It's too cold up there.
Get some water, quick.
Quiet, Shep!
Quiet!
- What's ailin' that dog?
- I don't know.
- Well, keep him quiet.
- Let him howl if it makes him feel good.
- Consarn it! He's better off than I am.
- Hush up such talk!
I mean it, I tell you.
I've had more than my share.
- Nothing ever goes right for me.
- [Chickens Squawking]
- Now, what the dickens?
- The fox! The fox is in my henhouse!
Give me that gun.
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't, consarn it.
He got two of your hens.
Well, we'll have to do without them. You run along, get the seed. I'll tend to Mary.
[Dog Continues Barking]
That's enough to make a man sell his soul to the devil!
- And I would for about two cents!
- [Barking Stops]
I guess nobody heard.
I hope not.
- [Thunder Rumbling]
- Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
[Livestock Shrieking]
- [Whistling]
- [Shrieking Fades]
Who are you?
My name is Scratch.
I often go by that name in New England.
I don't have any business with you.
Do you deny that you called me?
I've known people in other states who went back on their word, but I -
I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
You can't say that to me.
I'm New Hampshire.
And if I say I called you,
I did. Guess I did.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days... and yet it's all so unnecessary...
[Chuckles] when I think of your opportunities.
My opportunities?
- Of course. Why, man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.
- Hmph!
You just go about it the wrong way.
[Chuckles]
Oh, so many men do.
Hard work. That's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else.
It's all right for people who aren't lucky.
But once you're lucky, you don't have to work for other people.
[Chuckles]
You make them work for you.
Why, Mister, that sounds all right.
How do I go about it?
Clever man like yourself, he can find money anywhere.
Money to pay his bills, money for his wife and children, money enough to be a rich man.
All he needs is a friend to point it out to him, like this.
- Isn't real. It can't be.
- Oh, no. Wait.
Touch it.
Touch it.
Feel it with your hand.
- [Tom]Jabez.!
- Someone's calling you, Mr. Stone.
- Jabez Stone!
- Oh, there he is.
Howdy, Jabez.
- Howdy, Jabez.!
- Howdy. What do you want?
We just come to ask you if you'd made up your mind to join the grange.
- Grange? What grange?
- That farmers association we were talkin' about the other day.
No, I don't want to join.
Go away. Leave me alone.
We don't mean to force you, but it's only for your own good, neighbor.
- I look out for myself!
- We oughta stick together.
- Now, after Daniel Webster's speech.
- Daniel Webster can't help me.
Leave me alone.
Tell me, where did it come from?
You know the old story.
The Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on its way to Saratoga.
Some of the gold has been buried under your barn.
- Yes, why shouldn't it?
- Yes, of course.
People forgot, or the man who knew about it died.
You know how these things happen.
- It's mine. It's mine.
- Yes.
Yes, that's right,
Mr. Stone.
Oh, uh, there is just one little formality.
I would like your signature... here.
See?
And when it's done, it's done for seven years.
It's our usual form.
Of course, we can take up the question of renewal in due time.
What does it mean here, about my soul?
Mmm. Why should that worry you?
A soul. A soul is nothing.
Can you see it, smell it, touch it? No.
This soul -your soul - a nothing against seven years of good luck.
You'll have money and all that money can buy.
[Chuckles]
Upon my word, Neighbor Stone...
- if it were not for my firm's reputation in generous dealing, I -
- No! No!
Give it to me. I'll sign.
All right.
I'm afraid I'll have to... prick your finger, Neighbor Stone.
- [Groans]
- But what's a little pain to a lucky man?
[Chuckles]
Sign here.
[Thunder Booms]
- Afraid?
- No.
Excellent.
A firm, fair signature.
One that will last till doomsday.
[Chuckles]
I congratulate you, Neighbor Stone.
You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire.
- Well, I'll be -
- Yes.
Yes. Yes, indeed.
But not now.
Not for seven years.
[Giggling]
Oh, by the way,
I almost forgot.
- What is the date?
- April 7.
That would take us up to the... seventh day of April...
Just to remind you.
Though, of course, we'll be seeing each other in the interim.
Ah, what a beautiful sunset.
- Mary! Mary!
- Mary's all right again.
I thought you'd gone.
What would you do if you had a pot of gold?
- Oh, Jabez.
- Mary, what would you do?
I don't know.
I would pay our debts, and maybe I would buy a new bonnet.
- Really, I think I would live quite the same.
- Mary...
Iook.
Hessian gold.
I found it in the barn.
- Found it in the barn, eh?
- Yes, Ma!
I was getting the seed, and I saw one of the boards warped up, and I stumbled... and - and there it was.
Most outlandish thing
I ever heard tell.
But it's true, Ma!
Here. Take 'em in your hands and feel 'em, Ma.
Mary, Mary, you feel 'em.
Feel 'em.
They're real, all right.
What's the matter?
Aren't you glad?
I don't know, Jabez, but I'll try hard.
- I just can't take it all in.
- Oh, Mary.
Hessian gold.
Hmph!
Well, I hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
Ma! We'll none of us have to worry anymore. We're rich.
Well, that's comforting.
Supper.
Mashed potatoes and milk.
It's not going to be mashed potatoes and milk anymore.
It's gonna be turkey and oysters.
Seed corn and cattle.
A new bonnet for Mary, and a new dress for Ma.
We're going to have the best farm in New Hampshire... and I've got it right here in my hand.
That cap doesn't belong on the table.
Lord, we thank thee for this food.
Bless it to the good of our body and help us to do thy will. Amen.
**[Whistling]
** [Whistling Continues]
Whoa.
* Nothing else to do
There's nothing -**
- Hello, Jabez.
- Hello, Sheriff.
I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
You didn't get it, eh? Come on.
We'll have another talk with him.
- [Knocking]
- Who is it?
Jabez Stone.
- Hello, Stevens.
- Stone, you're wasting your time and mine.
I'm not gonna give you an extension.
Well, uh -
[Clears Throat]
Now look here, Stevens.
Uh, can't we, uh, talk that over?
It's kinda cold here.
Why don't you make a fire?
I can't afford it.
Nobody's paying me these days.
Stone, have you got the money?
I, uh, I managed to scrape up a bit for you.
- I thought if I made kind of a part payment -
- No, Stone.
- In gold.
- I'd like to know where you'd get it.
Well, you know, some folks are just lucky... and others pick it right out of the air, like that.
Sheriff, you're a witness.
This money was paid me voluntarily.
While it doesn't satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
Count that one, then, and that one and that one and that one... and that and that and that and that and that.!
Sheriff, you're here to witness.
Well, that makes everything clear now.
Come along, Sheriff.
Eight, nine, ten, eleven.
Eddie, that makes us all even.
Yep. It certainly was a big day for our store. Come back again soon.
Oh, Eddie!
Here's one for you.
[Yelps]
Golly!
I hope I run up against a pot of
Hessian gold one day myself, Mr. Stone.
Jabez. Jabez, what do you think of this?
Yeah, looks right elegant.
Newest thing by last fall catalog in Godey's Lady's Book.
- Do you think it's too fancy?
- Did you say "too fancy"?
Lands to goodness, child.
Not for you.
Nothing's too fancy for you.
You keep it right on.
Well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to have a few roses on it.
They're right pretty, Mary.
Now may I pick out a shawl for Ma?
Sure. Go right ahead and take your time.
I'm going over to the blacksmith shop and pick up a new plow.
- I'll be back in 30 minutes.
- I'll be waiting for you.
- [Toots]
- Oh!
Eddie, where are you going with that horn?
Haven't you heard, Mrs. Stone?
Daniel Webster's coming to Cross Corners.
- Daniel Webster here?
- Aren't you going to the reception?
[Tooting]
Whoa.
Martin! Hey, Martin!
Where's the blacksmith?
- Playing horseshoes with Daniel Webster!
- With who?
- Daniel Webster!
- Oh.
Crazy galoot, thinkin' he could take on Daniel Webster.
Daniel pitched shoes from his cradle, didn't you, Daniel?
- Yep, with my granny, and she wasn't bad either.
- [Laughing]
Well, I really have to go now.
The people at Cross Corners must be waiting for me.
It's really not very far,
Mr. Webster.
Oh, it's you again.
What do you want?
I thought, with the presidential election coming up, you might need some help.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Oh, I'll be there, too.
- That was pretty good, young man.
- Pretty good? That's perfect!
- Ten throws, Mr. Webster?
- All right, 10 throws it is.
- Let me take your coat, Mr. Webster.
- [Laughing]
[Tuba Tooting]
Friends! Neighbors! I beg of you to have a little more patience!
Now, let us rehearse the parade once more. Over here.
Get in line, now, as we rehearsed.
Now, attention.!
- Go!
- [Drumroll]
[Cheering]
Well, ha! You win.
That calls for a drink on me.
- I really must go now. Will you ride into the village with me?
- Oh, certainly!
Thank you, son.
Thank you.
[Jabez]
This is a great day for me.!
- Oh, Lem! Lem, will you take care of my buggy?
- All right.!
- Thank you!
- All right, we're goin' to the village.
[Children Shouting]
Daniel Webster is here.!
Daniel Webster is here.!
Daniel Webster is here!
Daniel Webster is here!
Daniel Webster is here.!
[Cow Lows]
I guess I'm not very popular in Cross Corners.
Daniel Webster's here!
Daniel Webster's here!
And look who's with him.
Well, of all the people.
- Thank you for the game.
- Welcome! Welcome to Cross Corners.
That's it!
That's it!
We are greatly honored with your presence, and I'm-
- Your health, Mr. Webster.
- What about my friends?
Let's all have a drink, and a bumper one for the champion, Jabez Stone.
Right away, sir.!
Right away.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Daniel Webster.
Medford rum.
[Sniffing]
A breath of the promised land.
And here's to the champion of the iron horseshoe, Jabez Stone.
Thank you. Here's to the champion of the whole United States...
- Daniel Webster!
- Daniel Webster!
- Where's the band? Where's the band?
- I don't know.
Oh. Go get them!
Go get them!
Go and get 'em?
What are you lookin' for, Colonel?
- What's your name?
- Martin Van Buren Aldrich.
My pa is the only Democrat in Cross Corners.
He said you had horns and a tail,
Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
You see, Martin, I only wear them when I'm in Washington.
But if you ever get down there,
I'll be glad to show 'em to ya.
Gee, would you?
Honest?
Of course. And you tell your father for me... that we may be on opposite sides of the fence... but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinion.
As long as the people do that, this country is all right.
- You understand, Martin?
- Yes, sir. I guess so. Gee.
- Speech, Mr. Webster.
- Speech, Mr. Webster.
They're asking for a speech,
Mr. Webster.
A speech? Oh, no.
I'm a little tired,
Squire Slossum.
- [Giggling]
- Besides, it's so pleasant here.
The sun, the air-
So pleasant in Cross Corners.
- But, Mr. Webster.
- You talk.
Listen, folks.
Well, I don't know much about "speechifying"... but I feel it my duty to -
- What's the matter with him?
Cat got his tongue?
- Hush up, Sarah.
Well, folks, what I want to say is, when a man like Daniel Webster visits us... we shouldn't ask him for a speech.
It's for us to speak, to tell him that we farmers thank our lucky stars... every day in the year for what he's done for us.
If anybody's gonna have corn in his crib, or hay in his barn... it'll all be due to our good friend and neighbor, Daniel Webster... who stood right up in Congress to protect us from loan sharks by a new law.
After hard work like that, well, it's only natural that
Daniel Webster gets tired.
He's tired of makin' speeches. He just wants a little rest in the sunshine.
And, folks, ifhe chooses Cross Corners' sunshine to rest in, that's mighty fine.
And I want to say this before I quit talkin;
We'll be hoein' corn, all due, like I says, to our good neighbor,
Daniel Webster.
And we'll keep on hoeing corn until he's in the White House in Washington where he belongs!
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray! Hooray!
An eloquent speech,
Neighbor Stone.
I couldn't have done better myself, under the circumstances.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Thank you.
I'd like for you to meet my wife, Mary.
- Well, if it isn't little
Mary Simpson from Franklin.
- It is.
You've got a smart man.
Hang on to him.
- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
- That's just fine.
Well, I have to be getting on to Franklin before night.
- Good-bye, Mary.
Remember me to your mother.
- Thank you, Mr. Webster.
- Good-bye, Jabez. God bless you both.
- Good-bye. Thank you.
- Good-bye, Squire. Good-bye, everybody!
- Good-bye.
[Shouting, Cheering]
Remember, Mary, how he said it?
"Couldn't have done better myself,
Jabez Stone."
[Snickers]
It was my first speech.
I don't know what happened to me.
I just stood up, and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
Yes, Jabez, it was a wonderful day... but I'm glad to be home again.
- Tired?
- Well -
- Well, what is it?
- I'm a little worried.
There's nothing to worry about now.
- Jabez, I -
- Mary, you just wait and see.
This is just the beginning- just the beginning of everything.
I'm going to be the biggest man in New Hampshire... and you're going to be the wife of the biggest man.
[Dog Barking]
[Barking]
Quiet, Shep!
Don't take cold, Jabez.
- There's a new moon, Mary.
- Yes, I know, Jabez.
There's hope and promise in it.
Planting and promise of a good harvest to come.
- What is it?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
[Barking]
[Horn Blows]
Lord, we thank thee for this food.
Bless it to the good of our body and help us to do thy will. Amen.
Now, look here, son.
I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again...
- but things that grow too fast will never-
- You look here, Ma.
I'm not a boy anymore, and I want that understood.
I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life.
Jabez, once you said we'd never change.
Never mind what I said once.
Listen to what I say now.
I've made up my mind.
[Barking]
Was that my son talking?
But what's a farmer to do, if- if he don't want to get roped in more by them loan sharks?
You don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
- Don't I?
- Nah.
Say, that's mighty white of you.
Not at all, Hank.
I'm glad to help ya.
Thank you, Jabez.
I really wouldn't need very much.
If you could just let me have some seed to start off with - enough for spring plantin'.
Seed? Easiest thing in the world. Come along.
Pick out everything you need.
- Sure you can spare it?
- Sure. I just bought some seed.
- Say, about the interest -
- Don't you worry about that.
Leave it all to me.
We won't talk business today.
You just bear this in mind:
I am not a man to get rich on other people's hard luck. Nope, not me.
Say, that's mighty fine of you, Jabez.
I've been through the mill myself, and I know just how you feel.
Here. The best seed you'll find in all New Hampshire.
- Asleep, Ma.
- That's good. Sit down.
I feel fidgety, Ma.
Not right.
Not right at all.
Lands! I'd think you were gonna have the baby, to hear ya.
- Sit down. You make me nervous.
- [Groans]
The way a man always is.
Thinks his son is the most important thing in the world.
- Say that again, Ma.
- Oh! Made me stick my finger.
A son.
Do you really think so, Ma?
Oh, get along with ya.
As if it matters to a grandma.
Perhaps you have an even chance.
[Wind Whistling]
Queer sort of weather we're having.
Weird, like everything else.
Thank God you can always depend on New England for weather.
We've got enough for the whole United States.
[Whispers]
A son.
An heir.
Money.
Money is a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
I figure it depends a might on how you get it and how you spend it.
- But I don't spend any.
- But you should, son.
That's all it's good for.
Do you really think that?
That's just common sense.
Now, a man like
Daniel Webster.
Guess they pay him high for what he does... but he's worth it, and he helps others.
Makes all the difference.
I know.
But suppose a man got his money in bad ways?
Wouldn't profit him none.
You see, son,
I'm old, and I've lived.
When a man gets his money in bad ways... when he sees the better course and takes the worse... then the devil's in his heart, and that fixes him.
And yet, a man could change all that, couldn't he?
A man can always change things.
That's what makes him different from the barnyard critters.
Where ya goin; son?
[Laughing]
[Cackles]
Oh, come, come, Neighbor Stone.
No need to get so excited.
I wouldn't try to cut that tree down, if I were you.
It means a breach of contract.
I don't care!
But you should, now that you're becoming a father.
You keep your tongue off that!
Yes, of course. Certainly.
I shan't even come to christening.
It would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.
But I may send a friend of mine, just for old times' sake.
- Yes, I think I'll do that.
- [Ma]Jabez.!
Get away! Get away! Get outta here.
Quick! Hurry! Get away!
Your mother.
I find her rather difficult.
Hardly the type for my sort of thing.
- Jabez.!
- Bye, Mr. Stone.
Jabez.!
Here you are, son. I was worried about you. Look at that hail.
The crops will be ruined!
- It don't matter.
- What's that you say?
- I say it don't matter.
- Now, that's the way to talk.
I know you've worked hard for this crop, but we'll make out.
Make out?
We'll do better than that.
I never thought
I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am.
I never thought I'd be glad of a hailstorm at harvesttime, but I am.
I'm glad of the rain, the storm and the hail.
[Sobs]
What's the matter?
What are you crying about?
Ruined.
All the fields ruined.
[Jabez] Yes, it's terrible what the hail has done to the fields... but not to my fields.
Look, Mary.! It didn't touch any of my wheat.! I'll have a rich harvest.!
Hello, Lem, Hank.
[Cackling]
You'd think that Stone was standing good with Providence somehow.
My wheat's no more use than a last year's crow's nest.
Maybe you'll let me help you out a bit.
Seems like someone's giving us the horselaugh.
I guess you're ripe and ready now to join our grange, eh?
Wait a minute! I can make you some better terms.
- Hi, boys!
- Howdy.!
Did ya ever see such hail?
Big as bowling balls out our way.
Broke all the windows and nearly killed the cat.
I'll take cider... hard.
[Scratch]
Boys...
- I'm here with an offer from Jabez Stone.
- What's that?
Well, seein' as how, due to yesterday's hail... nobody's got nothing to harvest in his own field...
Jabez thought maybe you might help him harvest his.
Never worked for anybody else in my whole life...
'cept when I was a shaver... and that was for my old man.
- I wouldn't do it.
- Well, I don't know.
- I'll think it over.
- What's there to think about?
Here's a dollar in advance for everyone who will work forJabez Stone.
* Come, ye thankful people, come *
*Raise the song ofharvest home *
*All is safely gathered in *
*Ere the winter storms begin **
- ** [Music Playing]
- [Man Calling Dance]
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Ma, how is she?
You'll be a father any minute now.
Golly, Ma!
Consarn that music. Shouldn't have had the harvest dance tonight.
Fiddlesticks.
She don't hear.
She's got better music than that to listen to.
[Baby Cries]
There. That's what I mean.
[Crying Continues]
Jabez.
Here's your son.
Howdy, son.
- I told you you had an even chance.
- [Giggles]
- Anything else, Doctor?
- No, just keep her warm.
Be careful, Jabez.
- Dorothy.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Fetch a hot brick.
- Right, ma'am.
Look here, everybody!
My son!
- Hey, it's a boy!
- Hooray forJabez Stone!
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray forJabez Stone!
That's enough.
Want him to catch a death of cold?
Don't be cross with him, Ma.
This doesn't happen every day.
Here.
- Jabez, I have a wish.
- Yes, Mary, what is it?
I want to name him Daniel.
After Daniel Webster?
Yes. I wrote to Mr. Webster... and asked him to be the godfather of our first baby.
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, I don't mind.
Why, lands! What's the matter with you, Jabez?
I should think you'd be flattered to have Daniel Webster as a godfather.
- Now, go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
- Sure, Ma.
- Oh! Thanks very much, Doc.
Thanks for everything.
- It's all right, Jabez.
Hurry up, Dorothy.
What's the matter with the brick?
Mary needs it.
- You're not Dorothy.
- No. She's gone.
- She couldn't be gone.
- But she is.
I have taken her place.
Don't you remember?
You wrote me a letter.
- Looks like my writing.
- It is.
[Laughs]
I have other recommendations, too... from a very dear friend of yours.
Never mind.
What's your name?
Belle.
- Belle?
- Belle Dee.
Belle Dee?
Where are you from?
From over the mountain.
From over the mountain.
[Ma]
Jabez?
No, that's for me to do.
- Night, Ma Stone.
- Good night, Dr. Simpson.
Who's she?
Dorothy?
No, it's me.
And this will keep you warm,
Mrs. Stone.
You're not resting well.
Oh, I know.
It's that music.
You need your sleep.
Is there anything else you want, Mrs. Stone?
- What's your name?
- Belle.
Thank you, Belle.
What a nice and kind girl.
- Who is she?
- The new maid, Jabez says.
But I don't like her, and I don't think we ought to keep her on.
That's forJabez to decide.
He's the head of the family.
- You all signed?
- Yeah, we all signed.
That's fine.
Leave all your worries to me.
- Have a cigar.
- Ah, thanks.
- Go on inside and have a good time.
- Sure. Why not?
* Pop goes the weasel

Shall we... dance, Belle?
Oh, no, Mr. Stone.
Your place is with your wife.
[Scratch]
Everybody dancin;!
Faster.!

Hold her tight.!
Swing her now with all your might.!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Come on.! Faster.!

Faster! Faster!
[Baby Crying]
Consarn it!
- [Wailing]
- ** [Singing, Indistinct]
* Sleep, baby, sleep *
* The little brooks together weave *
*Baby, sleep **
Jabez, where are you going?
[Wailing]
What's the matter, Neighbor Stone?
Your conscience bothering you?
Ha! We take care of that.
Give me your hand.
Make him go faster, Jabez.
Faster! Faster!
Golly, Belle, this is wonderful.
You know, we should go sleigh riding every Sunday.
- Why not every day?
- I can't. I got too much work to do.
- Others can do it for you.
- That's an idea.
Hey!
Hey, you! You can't fish there!
That's private property!
I'm Jabez Stone!
I'll have the sheriff after you!
[Laughing]
Golly, it's fun to scare people and watch 'em run. Hey.
Look. He caught some nice ones.
- Well, let's have them for breakfast.
- All right.
[Giggling]
Mornin', Mary!
Brought you some fish.
I want you to cook them for breakfast.
- But, Jabez, it's Sabbath.
I'm going to church with Ma.
- [Bell Ringing]
- Please, won't you come with us?
- I want you to fix the fish.
Oh, no, she won't.
I'll not have the scorn of God in this house with the smell of fish in it...
- polluting up the Sabbath.
- [Groans]
And as for you, let me tell you, young woman.
If you think you're running this house... because Mary hasn't put you in your place, you're mistaken.
- But, Ma -
- Don't you "Ma" me!
- Let's go, Mary.
The second bell's ringing.
- Comin', Ma.
Good-bye, little Daniel.
Take good care of him, Belle.
I certainly will, Mrs. Stone.
Jabez, you're sure you won't come with us?
I'll cook the fish myself.
It seems a little hard for your mother to get used to me... but I'm quite sure she will, in time.
Which way do you like 'em best?
[Glass Shatters]
Who did that?
The fella I caught fishing in my lake.
- I'll get him yet.
- [Sleigh Bells Jingling]
- Your friends are coming.
- Well, let's get ready.
Here we are. Hurry, Belle.
Get the drinks.
- Morning, Jabez.
- Ah, morning, Squire.
- How are you, Jabez?
- Hiya, fellas.
- And how's little Daniel today?
- By the way, Jabez... did you know that Daniel Webster was up in Franklin last week?
- Without stopping at Cross Corners?
- That's never happened before.
- I hope he has no grudge against us.
- Oh, no.
I had a letter from him the other day. A nice one.
I offered to lend him money for his campaign... but he thanked me and said he didn't need any.
- You offered money to Daniel Webster?
- Sure. I got enough.
You never know.
He might be president one day.
Gentlemen, what's the game?
Same limit as last Sunday?
- Well, I, uh -
- Ah, you'll have better luck today, Squire.
- Before I forget it, here's the money I owe you.
- Oh, thanks, Squire.
[Jabez]
Cards, gentlemen.
- [Crying]
- [Jabez] Card, Squire?
- [Crying]
- ** [Singing In French]
- [Jabez] How about you, Stu?
- ** [Continues]
- **[Singing Continues]
- [Jabez] And I'll raise you a hundred.
** [Continues]
[Jabez] Four eights, gentlemen.
Now it's my deal.
** [Humming]
And it is this kind of men of whom the Bible says...
"Either make the tree good and his fruit good...
"or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt... for the tree is known by his fruit."
And now, let us pray.
Almighty God, who has given us this good land for our heritage... save us from discord and confusion... and pride and arrogancy... and from every evil way.
- [Congregation] Amen.
- Oh, Lord, hide not thy face from me... on the day when I am in trouble.
Incline thy ear unto me.
Cast out the evil spirit... and lead Jabez back into thy kingdom.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- ** [Singing In French]
- I bet $50.
- I'm out.
- I call ya.
- Three aces. I win.
- Well, you win!
- You know, the sheriffs lucky for a beginner.
- You French?
No. I'm not anything.
- On with the game, Squire.
- [Laughing]
- [Church Bell Ringing]
- That's all for today.
You'll have to go.
Next time, as usual.
- [Bell Continues]
- Good-bye, Jabez.
[Squire]
I'll see you next week.
- [Jabez] Better luck next time, Squire.
- Oh, just a losing streak.
You better be careful, Jabez. People are talking about you in the village.
The village. Hmph!
[Man] It's like the Old Nick has got into him.
Gettin'worse every year.
The more he gets, seems more he wants.
[Tom]
The deal he made with Hank.
He used it as bait for the rest ofhis neighbor folk... to make them slave for him, too.
At first it seemed like out of the goodness of his heart.
Now I know different.
I used to think Miser Stevens was an ornery cuss.
He'd pinch a cent till the eagle squeals.
But now I'm thinkin' he ain't so all-fire bad, compared with Jabez.
Every year he builds a new barn, and now look at him.
Buyin' machinery and hirin' other folks to work for him.
He don't do nothin' but gamble and tend his horses.
That Hessian gold.
You can blame it all on that.
That girl he's taken on as nurse for the boy, or so he says... but anybody knows who she is.
It's a miracle his wife is standin' for that sort of thing all these years.
You know what a fine woman she is.
A man likeJabez could do so much good with his money.
A strange sickness seems to have come over him.
A plague, sorta.
Like the Bible tells about.
Look at the mansion he built.
- Granny!
- What is it?
When are we going to move to the new house?
Oh, we ain't a-gonna move.
The old one's good enough for us.
But I like the new one better.
[Chuckles] Well.
It's just too bad for you, Daniel.
- Strawberries.
- Don't grab!
Children ask for things.
At least good children do.
- Go and help your mother.
- [Chicken Squawking]
Now, lands to goodness.
What's happened to that old hen?
Daniel, did you use that slingshot again?
- I did not, Granny.
- Oh, yes, you did, Daniel.
I saw it from the window, and then to lie about it.
Give me that slingshot, Daniel.
It's mine, Ma. Pa made it for me, and I'm not gonna give it to anybody!
- Daniel, give me that slingshot!
- No, I won't!
- No, no, no! No!
- Oh!
Daniel! I've stood as much as I can bear.
- Come along.
- [Daniel Crying]
[Jabez] Hey.! What's going on here?
What happened?
- Where are you taking him?
Oh, no, you won't!
- I'm going to lock him up.
And why not?
I'm his mother.
And I'm his father.
You're not supposed to punish my son.
Now, it's all right, Daniel.
- What did he do?
- He lied to me again.
- I did not!
- He never lies to me.
[Belle] Now, come along, and we'll put on a nice red coat.
- Shall we?
- [Daniel] Oh, yes!
Jabez, how can you let her talk like that when the boy's present?
Oh.
- He won't respect me anymore.
- Isn't that your own fault?
My fault?
Oh, Jabez, all I want is to be proud of him.
He could be such a fine boy, if only we show him how to be.
He's my son, and I like him the way he is.
Why do you always pick on the boy?
If it's not him, it's me.
You don't like the way I live, my new friends, the house or anything.
- But I never said that.
- You don't have to.
It shows in your face.
Jabez, I am worried about the way you've changed.
That was something you said you'd never do. Remember?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Leave me alone.
- I'm all ready!
- Ah, that's fine, son. Come on.
- We're gonna go fox hunting.
Up in the upper pasture. Huh?
- Hooray!
- Granny, look at me.!
- I see ya.
Bye, Granny.
Bye, Mom.
[Barking]
Fox hunting? A Stone going fox hunting on a weekday.
And the earth crying out for the need of him.
Now, Ma, you just try to keep hold of yourself and set a good example for me.
Me? Why, look here,
Mary Stone.
- I'm worried about you.
- Worried about me?
Well, you can just stop.
- What's that?
- I said you should just stop worrying.
Because I've made up my mind.
Hey there,
Black Daniel!
- Hello!
- Someone to see you, Daniel!
[Daniel] If it's the British minister, take him around to the pantry.
Give him a drink.
Tell him to wait.
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Oh, that's different.
Well, boys, I gotta see a friend.
- Mary, do you mind if I indulge?
- Oh, of course not.
No, you wouldn't.
You're not the kind of a woman who is afraid of smoke or fire.
Now, let's talk about your affairs.
Oh, goodness, Mr. Webster.
I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Yes, you've been chatting a lot, but womanlike.
Nibbling around the edges.
But you'll forgive an old lawyer's legal mind.
I don't think you ever once came to the point.
And there is a point, isn't there?
Why, yes. It's -
It's hard to put into words.
There's the matter of little Daniel's schooling... and the new house.
And there's something else that's wrong.
It gets worse year after year.
It's like a shadow growing.
L-I can't really talk about it, even to Ma.
She puts it all on Jabez, and I won't stand for that.
I've heard a lot of odd things aboutJabez.
Seems he's not making the right kind of name for himself.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Oh, you don't have to defend him to me.
I've been called names myself.
You see, all I care about is Jabez.
He was the first man I loved.
He never used to care about money.
We -We were poor as Job's turkey, and none of us minded.
Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves.
L-I've seen him hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean.
I've heard him mock at the church bells - the bells that rang at our wedding.
All that isn't like him, Mr. Webster.
It must be my fault somehow, my fault.
You know, Mary... you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father... and I think he wants me to help you a little.
We sometimes feel that we're licked in this life.
We weren't put here to be licked.
Don't you believe it.
We sometimes feel the shadows have got hold of us - the shadows of evil.
But still, it's up to us to fight.
You know, I was planning, just before you came... to make a little trip over to Cross Corners... and to get acquainted with that godson of mine and other things.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster?
Yeah. Yeah, not bad.
Not bad at all.
Looks all right, eh, Belle? It'll give the folks something to talk about.
- Now, the people, Jabez. The people.
- Ah, folks or people.
What's the difference among friends? Hey!
- Don't tear it down again.
You have to do that?
- Well, uh -
I'm sorry, sir, but that's part of the fitting.
Well, as long as you have it ready for the party.
- Good morning, Squire Slossum.
- Good morning, Belle.
- May I have your hat?
- Oh, how do you do, Squire?
- Jabez.
- Feel that material.
Hey, you! Look out there.
You're scuffin' my carpet.
- Those things cost money.
- Won't you sit down?
Thank you. Uh, I'm rather pressed for time, but it's very kind.
Get some wine for the squire, Belle.
Well, very elegant home you have here, Jabez.
- You really think so?
- Yes, but you wanted to discuss something.
- Some business, I believe.
- Yes, yes. Won't take a minute.
- Can you keep a secret?
- Of course.
- Daniel Webster's coming to my party.
- Daniel Webster?
Yes. That's the reason
I wanted to talk to you.
Here's a list of the people
I've invited. Look 'em over.
No, no, no. Champagne for the squire,
Belle. Champagne.
- All right.
- Well, what do you say?
They all the right kind of people, or did I miss anybody?
Well, the only person you've missed is the president.
You think that's a joke.
I had him on that, too.
Only I was afraid Webster might feel insulted.
No, you keep that.
That's for you.
I want you to talk up the party and to make sure that the best folks really come.
- You mean you want me to go around and -
- Yes, sirree.
That's the idea. You can tell 'em all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
We'll get them all here, and then I'll say...
"Look here, folks. Here's
Daniel Webster, my guest of honor."
Golly, I can see their eyes pop out right now.
- Are you sure he'll come?
- Of course I am!
- Want to bet?
- Why not?
- How much?
- Five thousand. Exactly what I owe you.
[All Laughing]
Hello there, Colonel.
Do you want a lift? Ho!
Well, I wouldn't mind.
My name's Daniel Stone.
Not the son ofJabez Stone.
- Yes, sir.
- Ha. Well, this is an occasion.
Come on. Giddyap, George.
Come on, Jeb. [Makes Kissing Sound]
Gee, that fair.
- It hasn't opened yet.
- No, but I can hardly wait.
Mister, tell me. Will there really be a man that eats fire?
I guess there will be, if it says so.
An-An-And "two unparalleled
Circassian beauties"?
- What is that?
- Young man, you've got me there.
Mmm. Daniel Webster will be there, too.
Mmm. A list of varied attractions.
Which one would you like to see first?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater.
Well, what about
Daniel Webster?
- I'll see him last.
- And it'd serve him right.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't - Don't let me ever catch you doing that again.
- Why, it don't hurt.
- Yes, it does hurt, and don't do it again.
- You make 'em go faster.
- No, Daniel.
They're not racehorses.
They're two good, old friends of mine.
I call them Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
Most dependable team for long journeys.
Then I've got another one called Missouri Compromise.
And a Supreme Court... a fine, dignified horse, though you have to push him on every now and then.
Golly! I'd like to see all your horses.
Mmm. Maybe you can sometime.
I'm a farmer you know, and I love to show my farm.
But the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
What's that, sir?
Well, it's high and it's wide... and it goes a long ways.
There's a wind blowing through it... and it has a blue roof over it.
It's the hills and the rivers flowing to the south... and the new states growing in the west.
- Anybody can see that.
- No, that's where you're wrong, Mr. Stone.
Some people live and die without ever seeing it.
They can't see the country for the money in their pockets.
They think their state is the country or the way they live is the country... and they're willing to split the country because of it!
Well, I hope you'll meet them all when you've grown up.
You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties.
They are part of the fair, to be sure.
But if we had to depend upon them in a permanent sort of way... this country would have stopped at the Allegheny Mountains.
But it didn't stop.
I know it didn't stop.
- Granny told me it didn't.
- Ha. No, sirree, it didn't.
And it won't, no matter what happens... as long as the people at the fair believe in freedom and union.
Well, giddyap, Constitution.
We got to be getting on, Mr. Stone.
- Faster, faster!
- Oh! Oh!
Whoa.! Ho.! Ho.!
Young man, I think you've got this coming to you!
- Didn't I tell you not to do that again?
- [Crying]
- Hello, Daniel Webster.
- How are you?
- Hello, Black Daniel.
- [People Chattering]
- Are you Mr. Webster?
- Yes, I'm Mr. Webster, your godfather.
Now, you run along and behave yourself.
I'm sorry, Mr. Webster.
[Whimpers]
I expected to see all you folks over atJabez Stone's for the housewarming party.
- I hope you didn't wait for me to lead the parade.
- Well, not exactly, Mr. Webster.
We wanted to have a chat with you before we go to the party.
Would you mind having a drink with us?
Would I mind having a drink with you gentlemen?
What a question to ask Daniel Webster.
[All Laughing]
Ma. I'm leaving.
So you made up your mind to go to his party.
- You're not angry with me, are you?
- Aw, fiddlesticks!
I might have done the same thing if it had been my husband... only I'd take the whip along.
Be sure to let me know if Daniel's there.
I won't forget.
**[Classical]
** [Classical]
- No one here yet, huh?
- No. No one but she.
- Consarn it!
- What's the matter?
Afraid you'll lose your bet with the squire?
Ah, it's not that.
It - It just makes me look so -
- [Mary]Jabez.
- See? They're coming.
- Daniel, I thought you were in bed.
- I got up, Mommy, because -
- What did you do to that cat?
- Nothing.
She was crying in front of my window.
I think she's sick.
Oh, she's probably hungry.
- May I give her something to eat?
- Of course you may.
- Oh, why don't they come?
- Jabez, couldn't they play something gayer?
That's the kind of music they play for rich people.
Belle. Belle!
Belle. Who are those people out there?
What do they want?
They want to see how fine
Jabez Stone lives these days.
They're waiting for your guests, too.
Consarn it.! I'm paying you for playing.!
So keep on playing.!
**[Classical]
- Jabez.
- Well, what do you think about the new house, Mary?
Is it larger than Webster's at Marshfield? What about it?
You've been there.
Well, it - it's different, that's all.
What's the matter with them?
Why don't they come?
He's certainly made himself the big frog in the little puddle around here, hasn't he?
That isn't the worst.
Hank.
Show Mr. Webster that foul contract you got with Jabez.
You see, Mr. Webster, it all seemed so simple when it started.
[Hank]
Just like gettin'loans for nothin;
But when I couldn't pay him after that big hail... he was worse than all the rest of the loan sharks.
I wish now I'd listened to you, Tom, and joined the grange.
Well, I'm afraid he's got you.
All of you. Sewed up tight in his money pocket.
Well, isn't there anything you can do,
Mr. Webster?
Oh, I shall do my best.
I see why you're here.
Belle. Didn't I tell you to leave her alone?
You knew nobody was coming.
- I didn't.
- You're lying.
Lying to you?
Why should I?
You know that you are in my house.
I know, and you could show me the door.
You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
You think you're smart,
Mrs. Stone.
You thinkJabez will be lonely, and you can be near him again.
Looks like your big chance tonight.
But you're wrong.
You can't win him back.
Not that way.
- That's my problem.
- [Door Opens]
- Welcome, Mr. Stevens.
- Good evening, Mrs. Stone.
- I'm so glad you came.
- Yes.
- Good evening, Jabez.
- Good evening. Come in.
- I'm sorry. I'm a little late.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- That's no place for a cat.
- She's sick, Pa.
Never mind.
Take her away.
Come on.
Sit down.
- Where is everybody?
- I - I don't know.
I can't figure it out.
I invited them all.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez.
How old is he now?
About seven, isn't he?
No, not seven.
I'm sure.
- Well, it seems to me
I remember when you paid me.
- Never mind.
What's the matter with you?
You look so -
- Aren't you afraid?
- Afraid of what?
Of what happens after we die.
Are you plumb crazy, man?
What do you think happens?
We're buried. That's all.
But what becomes of our souls?
Why are you afraid about something that isn't there?
Don't say that.
I know it is.
I found out.
All right.
So it's buried with you.
But what if one hasn't a soul anymore?
What of that?
Well, what about it?
Who cares anyhow?
I do. And I think you should, too.
Stevens, what's this all leading up to?
You know something.
Come on. Out with it.
You know something about me.
Belle, who are these people?
They're all friends of mine.
From over the mountain.
- Hooray forJabez Stone.
- [Eerie, Hushed Voices]
Hooray forJabez Stone.
Thanks. Welcome.
Eat, drink.
- And dance!
- [Eerie Voices]
Dance, dance, dance, dance!
- Music.
- **[Eerie Melody]
[Mary]Jabez.!
Mr. Webster's coming.!
- Well, where is he?
- That's his buggy coming up the hill, isn't it?
Mr. Stevens, let's dance.
No, no. I can't dance.
- Oh, yes, you can dance with me.
- No, no.
- [Stevens] No.
- **[Eerie Melody Continues]
Mr. Webster.
I'm so glad you came.
Are you, Mary? [Chuckles]
Well, I'm glad to see you again.
Well, the party seems to be quite a success.
- Welcome, Mr. Webster.
This is a great day for me.
- How are you?
Come on in, sir, and meet all my guests.
Take the seat of honor.
Oh, that's just fine,
Neighbor Stone... uh, but you see, I've got to be very careful about my seats of honor.
Where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country has its eye on me.
Anybody in public life has that difficulty.
Even you, Jabez Stone.
They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies... and they see much more than we think they do... and understand much more.
Do you know what
I'm talking about?
- What do you have on your mind?
- You, Jabez Stone.
You and a lot of poor farmers hereabouts - all good men of the earth and in trouble because of you.
Or am I wrong about those contracts?
- Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
- They'd have a good neighbor... and that's worth more than anything else. Much, much more.
Oh, no.
Not for me it isn't.
I'm sorry you can't see that.
I know you could once.
I heard you make a little speech once that I'll always remember.
And the others do, too.
They remember what a fine fellow you were.
And now they see how you've changed.
And that's why they didn't want to come here tonight.
You're as blind as a Burma bat... you and your gold pot.
Mind you, it's not the money I'm talking about. It's what you make of it.
Well, I don't know what you're talking about.
**[Melody Gains Tempo]
- Let me tell you something.
- I haven't time to listen to this!
No, you haven't time for anything or anybody!
You haven't time for your mother, your wife or your child.
Oh, I see. It's you.
You. You brought
Daniel Webster here!
- No, she didn't.
- You're trying to make a fool out of me!
You played the sneak behind my back, made up lies against me!
You can get yourself out of my house right now!
Come along, Mary.
- Mommy!
- Daniel, you stay here!
- No! No, I won't!
- Daniel! Daniel!
- Why, you -
- Jabez, please!
I don't want to talk to you!
[Laughing]
You should have done that years ago.
Fetch me a drink.
Close the windows.
Build a fire.
Feeling chilly?
[Chuckles]
Wh-Why, what's the matter,
Mr. Stone? You look worried.
You promised me happiness, love, friendship.
Just a minute. I promised you money and all that money could buy.
I don't recall any other obligations.
But, uh -
Well, let's, uh -
Let's look at the contract, huh?
"Sherwin, Slatterly, Stevens."
I can cross him off the list.
- That Miser Stevens?
- Yes, yes. He's an old customer.
[Muffled Voice]
Help me, Neighbor Stone! Help me!
- That's Miser Stevens's voice.
- Miser Stevens's soul.
I'm sorry for the disturbance.
It can't be.
He's in there dancing.
He was.
- Dead?
- In the midst of life... one really hates to close these long-standing accounts... but, uh, business is business.
Do they all look like moths?
Well, the ones I get usually do. Yes.
- Are they all so small?
- Small?
Oh, I see what you mean.
Why, they vary.
Now, a man like Daniel Webster... if I ever got hold of him, I wouldn't be able to keep him in my pocket.
I'd have to have a special box built for him.
Even so, I imagine the wingspan would be astonishing.
[Chuckles] Now, in your case, I'd be able to put you in my vest pocket.
[Jabez] No, no.!
My time isn't up yet.!
Trying to break our contract,
Mr. Stone?
- I'm through with you!
- [Chuckles]
What a headstrong fellow.
- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
- My time isn't up yet.
But you violated clause five of our contract.
I could collect right now if I chose.
Oh, no.
No, no. Not now.
I have so many things to make up for.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate,
Mr. Stone.
You know I'm a generous man.
I'm always open to reason.
Uh, with a little security, I -
Anything, anything.
You can have it all back.
The money, the house, the farm - the whole caboodle!
Oh, I'm afraid that's not the sort of security I was thinking of.
You see, there's that promising little fellow.
Your son.
No. Oh, no.
Not my son. Not him.
I'd rather go with you now no matter what happens to me.
Ah. It's not fair to bargain with you now.
I'll give you until midnight.
Until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more.
Daniel. Daniel.
Daniel. Daniel!
Daniel! Daniel!
Mary!
Daniel! Daniel!
Daniel.! Mary.! Daniel.!
Mary, where are you?
[Whimpering]
Oh, Lord, have mercy!
Jabez.
[Sobbing]
Oh, Ma.
Little Daniel. Mary.
[Pants]
Where are they?
Gone with Mr. Webster to Marshfield, son.
You told Mary to go.
Jabez! Are you coming with me over the mountain? Jabez!
Mary! Mary!
Mr. Webster!
- Mary! Oh, Mary!
- Jabez!
Forgive me, Mary!
Forgive me!
- Mr. Webster, you take care of the boy.
- Oh, Jabez!
[Panting]
My time's up, Mary.
No, it isn't. I'd fight 10,000 devils to save a New Hampshire man.
It's here you said you closed the deal with him?
Yes, Mr. Webster.
It's here where it all began.
I see.
This is where he wants to collect, too, hmm?
Here, Jabez.
- Oh, Mary.
- Can't I stay?
No, Mary, I think you'd better go back to the house.
What love and trust can do for a husband, you've done for yours.
And, frankly speaking, in a few moments... this is not going to be any place for a lady.
- Mr. Webster, you will help him then?
- I'll do my best.
You must go, Mary.
Now, don't be afraid, Jabez.
Remember what the Good Book says.
"Set me as a seal upon thy heart... as a seal upon thine arm; for love is strong as death."
We grow plucky women in New England.
How long do we have to wait?
- Till midnight.
- Oh, that's fine.
- Then we have time to christen a jug.
- [Dog Barking]
Old Medford rum.
Oh, there's nothing like it.
You know, somehow or other... waiting becomes wonderfully shorter with a jug.
- [Dog Barking]
- I saw an inchworm once take a drop of this... and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. [Chuckles]
[Dog Howling]
- Will you have a nip?
- No, there's no joy in it for me.
Oh, come, come, now.
Just because you sold your soul to the devil... that needn't make you a teetotaler.
[Knocking]
Hurry, Mr. Webster.
Hurry while you still have time.
No, no. I never left a jug or a case half-finished in all my life.
- [Knocking]
- Come in.
[Wind Whistling]
Ah. So we meet again,
Mr. Webster.
Yes. I'm the attorney of record forJabez Stone.
- Might I ask your name?
- Scratch will do for the evening.
Ah. May I join you?
Certainly, but be careful.
Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself.
[Chuckles] Even kicked back once at you, didn't it?
- Who? Me?
- Oh. Not that you've ever been drunk.
No. No, indeed,
Mr. Webster.
But a kind of a - an overpowering lassitude.
Or more plainly, a deep, enveloping sleep.
Why, there isn't enough old Medford rum... in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy.
Talk never proved that question,
Mr. Webster.
- Cup for cup. What do you say?
- All right.
- Cup for cup.
- Mr. Webster, don't!
- Oh, don't be afraid.
- Now, Mr. Stone, are you willing to give me your son...
- in exchange for an extension of our contract?
- Never!
Surely this matter can be settled out of court without any difficulty.
My client is prepared to offer a compromise.
Ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars.
Name your figure.
- I'll raise it even if I have to mortgage Marshfield.
- [Chuckles]
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your client do you credit, Mr. Webster.
But if you have no further arguments to adduce, I'll take him along now.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch.
If you have any evidence, produce it.
Of course. All open and above board, in due and legal form.
- That your signature?
- You know darn well it is.
Hmm. This appears - uh, mind you, I say appears to be properly drawn.
But you shan't have this man.
A man isn't a piece of property.
Mr. Stone is an American citizen... and an American citizen cannot be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
"Foreign"?
Who calls me a foreigner?
Oh, I never heard of the de -
I never heard of you claiming American citizenship.
And who with a better right?
When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there.
When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck.
Am I not still spoken of in every church in New England?
[Chuckles] It's true, the North claims me for a Southerner... and the South for a Northerner, but I'm neither.
Tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it... my name is older in the country than yours.
Then I stand on the Constitution.
I demand a trial for my client.
- You mean a jury trial?
- I do.
And if I can't win this case with a jury, you'll have me, too.
[Whistles]
If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil... we'd better give the country back to the Indians.
- Very well. You shall have your way, Mr. Webster.
- [Chuckles]
But you'll have to admit that this is hardly the case for an ordinary jury.
[Scoffs]
Be it the quick or the dead.
- So it be an American judge and an American jury.
- Quick or the dead.
You have said it.
[Chuckles]
May the better man win,
Mr. Webster.
I'll drink to that,
Mr. Scratch.
[Knocking Echoes]
You must pardon the leathery toughness of one or two.
Mr. Webster!
Captain Kidd.
He killed men for gold.
Simon Girty, the renegade.
He burned men for gold.
Governor Dale.
He broke men on the wheel.
Asa, the Black Monk.
He choked them to death.
[Giggles]
Floyd Ireson and Stede Bonnet... the fiendish butchers.
Walter Butler, king of the massacre.
Big and Little Harp, robbers and murderers.
Teach, the cutthroat.
Morton, the vicious lawyer.
And General Benedict Arnold.
You remember him, no doubt.
Ajury of the damned.
Dastards, liars, traitors, knaves.
This is monstrous.
You asked for a jury trial, Mr. Webster.
Your suggestion.
- The quick or the dead.
- I asked for a fair trial.
Americans all.
[Snickering]
- [Bells Jingling]
- Oyez, oyez, oyez.
The trial tream of the midnight court... of the state of New Hampshire in the county of Franklin is now in session.
Justice Hawthorne presiding.
- [Bells Jingling]
- Oyez, oyez, oyez.
The Devil versus Jabez Stone.
[Bells Jingling]
Who appears for the plaintiff?
I, Your Honor.
- And for the defendant?
- I, Your Honor.
Are you content with the jury,
Mr. Webster?
I object to General Benedict Arnold,
Your Honor.
He was a flagrant traitor to the great American cause.
- Objection denied.
- [EerieJeering]
Prosecution, proceed.
Ah.
Your Honor.
Gentlemen of the jury.
This case need not detain us long.
It concerns one thing alone.
The transference, barter, sale of a certain piece of property... to wit, his soul, byJabez Stone.
Now, transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed.
I offer the deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit "A."
- I object!
- Objection denied.
- [Jeering]
- I object to this jury, Your Honor.
I move it be discharged for flagrant and open bias.
- Objection denied.
- [Jeering]
Mark it Exhibit "A."
I shall now callJabez Stone to the witness stand.
Jabez Stone to the witness stand.
Mr. Stone... did you or did you not sign that document?
But you tricked me into it.
You told me my soul was nothing - that I could forget all about a soul in exchange for money.
- But that was a lie, a lie, a lie!
- [Chuckling]
That is highly irrelevant to the case, Your Honor.
Leave out the soul.
Proceed.
I should like to ask Mr. Stone... whether or not I faithfully fulfilled my part of the bargain.
Didn't I give you seven years of good luck and prosperity?
Didn't I make you the richest man in the country?
Yes, I'm the richest man in the country.
I can't see, I can't think of anything but money, money, money, money, money!
Well, I'm hardly responsible for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.
Prosecution rests.
And does the jury wish to consider the case?
Evidently it does not.
Take your man, Mr. Scratch.
I protest, Your Honor!
I wish to cross-examine to prove -
There will be no cross-examination in this court.
[EerieJeering]
You may speak if you want to... but let me warn you, Mr. Webster.
If you speak and fail to convince us... you too are doomed.
- Lost and gone.
- [Bell Tolls]
- Lost and gone.
- Lost and gone.
- [Bell Tolls]
- [Eerie, Hushed Voice]
Drag him down with us.
- Drag him down with us.
- Lost and gone.
- [Bell Tolls]
- Lost and gone. Lost and gone.
- Lost and gone.
- Be still!
Gentlemen of the jury.
Tonight it is my privilege to address a group of men...
I've long been acquainted with in song and story...
- but men I had never hoped to see.
- [EerieJeering]
My worthy opponent,
Mr. Scratch... called you Americans all.
Mr. Scratch is right.
You were Americans all.
Oh, what a heritage you were born to share.
Gentlemen of the jury,
I envy you... for you were present at the birth of a mighty union.
It was given to you to hear those first cries of pain... and behold a shining babe... born of blood and tears.
You are called upon tonight to judge a man named...
Jabez Stone.
What is his case?
He is accused of breach of contract.
He made a deal to find a shortcut in his life - to get rich quickly.
The same kind of a deal all of you once made.
You, Benedict Arnold.
I speak to you first because you are better known than the rest of your colleagues here.
What a different song yours could have been.
A friend of Washington and Lafayette. A soldier.
General Arnold, you fought so gallantly for the American cause till -
Let me see.
What was the date? 1779.
That date burned in your heart.
The lure of gold made you betray that cause.
And you, Simon Girty, now known to all as "renegade."
A loathsome word.
You also took that other way.
And you, Walter Butler.
What would you give for another chance... to see the grasses grow in Cherry Valley without the stain of blood?
I could go on and on and name you all... but there's no need of that.
Why stir the wounds?
I know they pain enough.
You were fooled likeJabez Stone... fooled and trapped in your desire to rebel against your fate.
Gentlemen of the jury... it is the eternal right of every man to raise his fist against his fate!
But when he does, he's at crossroads.
You took the wrong turn; so did Jabez Stone.
But he found it out in time.
He's here tonight to save his soul.
Gentlemen of the jury...
I ask you to giveJabez Stone another chance to walk upon this earth... among the trees... the growing corn... and the smell of grasses in the spring.
What would you all give for another chance... to see those things you must all remember... and often long to touch again?
For you were all men once.
Clean American air was in your lungs... and you breathed it deeply... for it was free and blew across an earth you loved.
These are common things
I speak of.
Small things, but they are good things.
Yet, without your soul, they mean nothing.
Without your soul, they sicken.
[Chuckles]
Mr. Scratch once told you... that your soul meant nothing, and you believed him... and you lost your freedom.
Freedom isn't just a big word.
It is the morning and the bread and the risen sun!
It was for freedom we came to these shores in boats and ships!
It was a long journey, a hard one and a bitter one!
Yes, there is sadness in being a man.
But it is a proud thing, too... and out of the suffering and the starvation and the wrong and the right... a new thing has come:
A free man.
And when the whips of the oppressors are broken... and their names forgotten and destroyed... free men will be talking and walking under a free star.
Yes. We have planted freedom in this earth like wheat.
And we have said to the skies above us...
"A man shall own his own soul."
Now, here is this man.
He is your brother.
You were Americans all.
You can't be on his side, the side of the oppressor!
LetJabez Stone keep his soul... the soul which doesn't belong to him alone... but to his family, his son and his country!
Gentlemen of the jury, don't let this country go to the devil!
FreeJabez Stone.
God bless the United States and the men who made her free.
The jury... finds for the defendant.
- Mr. Webster!
- [Rooster Crows]
Allow me to congratulate you as one gentlemen to another, sir.
By the 13 original colonies!
You double-barreled, slab-sided, lantern-jawed, note-shaving crook!
Get out of here! And don't you ever come back to the state of New Hampshire again!
- If I ever become the president of the United States -
- You?
[Chuckles] You'll never be president.
I'll see to that.
- Mary.
- Oh, Jabez!
- I think we deserve a little breakfast.
- Oh, Mr. Webster!
It's good to see you smile again, Mary.
[Tom]
Jabez? Jabez.!
Jabez, your new house is on fire!
Good. The consarn thing ought to burn.
But I'm glad you're here. There are some other things I want to settle.
- Those contracts.
- First, let's all have breakfast.
- Oh, thank you, Mary.
- Here they are.
Ma! Ma, there's a few more people coming.
- I've seen 'em.
- Is there enough?
Why, certainly.
We've got plenty for everybody.
- Bread and butter and eggs and sausage.
- What about Mr. Webster's pie?
Don't you worry.
I've got it all ready.
- Daniel, tell 'em to hurry up.
The coffee's gettin' cold.
- Yes, Granny.
- Breakfast is ready!
- Well, Jabez, now that you've torn up the contracts... would you like to join the grange?
Of course, Tom.
I'd be glad to. From now on, we'll all work together, huh?
[Mary]
Please, everybody, sit down.
Well, this is a wonderful spread you have here, Mary.
[Chattering]
You know, there's nothing better... than a good, old-fashioned country breakfast on a morning like this.
- Where's Ma Stone?
- Oh, she'll be here in a minute.
- She's got a special surprise for you.
- Oh.
- Granny!
- [Mary] Come on, Ma.!
[Tom]
There she is.!
- Peach pie?
- Peach pie.
Well! What the devil!
Well, who laughs last?
Once upon a time when old Baghdad was new and shiny, there was a beggar and what a rascal!
He called himself the king of beggars.
Having convinced himself that he was a king of some kind,
He'd roam the streets at night seeking adventure disguised as a prince.
In a great palace in the city lived a great lady.
A beautiful lady.
And she had quite a time with this prince.
Of course, she didn't know that he was only a beggar.
Her lord and master was the Grand Vizier.
A very powerful man.
When you know him better, you won't wonder that she wandered.
On the throne sat the young caliph, ruler of this great empire.
But he was not content to sit and rule.
He wanted the truth about his kingdom and his people.
And to learn the truth, he also roamed the streets of Baghdad at night disguised as a gardener's son.
And one day in this disguise, he met his fate.
An adorable maid.
And who do you think she was?
None other than the daughter of that rascal, the king of beggars.
Here is the fabulous old city.
Let's cross the river with this caravan right into the exotic heart of romantic, fantastic Baghdad.
A caravan!
Look, a whole dinar.
Dinar, bah. Pigeon food. Look here comes the feed for elephants.
Round is the moon. 'Round goes the moon.
The wind and the rain and the moon
'round again.
Halt, the magical great of the earth.
Here's a creature who will talk thy mother-in-law to death.
She puts on her best feathers, and comes from nowhere only to greet nobility.
A thousand blessings, my benefactor.
May the golden cupboards of the water of life be open to thee.
Alms for the love...
The stench of my soul increases from dawn to dawn.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Hurry, hurry, the buzzards are waiting for thee.
Look, the rich dervish miser.
Not one dinar from him in twenty years.
I've been much too patient with him.
Get away from there, mongrel.
One moment, kind merchant, in the name of Allah.
Must the poor give away their blessings forever, oh great of heart?
Out of my way, beggar.
But this small boy looks hungry.
A little compassion.
Put that back.
As thou sayest.
Let the little boy starve.
What, already hatched?
How time flies.
Give me that.
- Very well, my friend, very well.
- No, give it to me.
All right, all right, but don't let it fall.
You know how young it is.
It's just a baby.
How did the donkey's ear lay an egg?
You're holding up the caravan.
Out of the way.
A thousand pardons, kind merchant.
...Alms for the love of Allah...
Did you see that?
That thief.
Sharp eyes, sharp ears, very useful.
Gold?
An embarrassment of riches.
Fate has been very kind.
Tonight I shall celebrate.
Moolah, take my place.
Moolah you can extract from the caravan.
Watch him, Feisal.
See he doesn't fall asleep.
You're not leaving with all these fine pickings?
I have a rendezvous.
Scum!
To the caliph I may be dirt but to dirt, I am the caliph.
Salam, dirt.
What are you doing up there, old cactus?
Looking for a sweetheart?
Never you do that again.
Marsinah.
- My little lotus bud.
- Good evening, father.
Open your pretty lips, my little dove.
- Delicious.
- And why not, my pigeon?
It's mixed with sugar and vinegar like the good and bad things in life.
Rose water to give it perfume, and sweet seeds for flavor.
And it's all put together by honey bees
I have working for you in a corner of the caliph's garden.
A special flock of bees?
Very special.
- And look what I'm making for you.
- Mm, delicious.
I thought you might come home late and be ravenously hungry.
What a pity.
I must go to a banquet tonight.
Again?
Again? As king of the world of magic,
I'm very much in demand.
How is this little hand going to look when you grow up and marry the prince I promised you?
Maybe he'll be hungry sometime.
Your prince is never hungry.
A little thirsty but never hungry.
I have a confession, father.
Let's have it.
I promised Karsha I would tell you.
I was looking over the wall without my veil.
That's why Karsha was on the ladder trying to see what I was looking at.
Outside those wall, my blossom, is a very ugly world.
Except in a palace of your own.
That's why I built the wall around you.
Leave it there.
Until your prince comes to batter it down and carry you off to a world as lovely as you are.
The fairy tale always comes true.
Never forget that, my little princess.
Now, I must dress for the feast.
Sorry, kitties, but he's going out with royalty tonight.
Thank you, my beauty.
Let me see how you look.
Oh, beautiful.
Now that you have me beautiful, off to bed with you and get your beauty sleep.
Blessings, my rose, sleep well.
I've hung a lovely moon in the sky for you.
Sometimes the old moon keeps me awake.
Turn your pretty little nose into the pillow or I'll come up and blow out the moon.
- Bah!
- Huh?
I said, Bah!
That's all I've heard you say in thirty years.
One of these days,
I'll say more than that.
Police, guards, police.
Police? I don't see any police.
What are you fighting for on a night like this?
I called them liars. They were liars.
So's everybody.
Not when you make them lose their jeppers.
Then they tell you the truth.
- Is that what you want?
- Yes, I want the truth.
Truth, my friend, is boredom.
Maybe so but it's exciting and worth fighting for.
Give me a man who laughs when he fights.
- Come and have some wine.
- Thanks, I will.
Hey, Prince...
Don't expect the truth from anyone here.
They're charming people.
They don't bother with it.
Charming people? They look like a bunch of back alley merchants and cutthroats to me.
To you? My friend, they are all nobility.
I don't recognize any of them.
How should a young elephant like you recognize nobility?
I go to all the parades.
Excellency, I have a place for you.
Salam, ladies.
I won't tell you their names but they're all queens in disguise.
Magic black eyes.
Take one look and turn away.
They're dangerous.
Don't worry. He told me I was the only girl in Baghdad.
So you are, my blossom.
Hardy young antelope I've fell in with.
What draggle tail part of the city do you come from?
Mind if I choose for myself?
Save me Laeida?
She is not in yet.
Drink some wine.
In a few minutes, you'll see a young beauty worth fighting for.
I hope I can agree with you.
Agree with me?
- The insolence.
- I'm sorry.
My friend, if she weren't a lovely sight to behold, she wouldn't be coming here for an evening with me.
Oh? Well, might I ask just who you are?
Keep it to yourself.
One of the princes of the empire.
I sit in the counsels of the caliph.
Oh.
You do?
Then you know the new caliph.
Tell me, what's he like?
The new caliph is a yahoo.
A yahoo?
His father left him a score of lovely ladies.
And what does the young gander do?
He turns them loose.
Bah!
Heart of a king should be big enough for all the women in the world.
If a king can't act like a king, he's a yahoo.
He doesn't tell you what to do about the ladies, does he?
My friend,
No one has to tell me what to do with the ladies.
You're sitting with the master.
Oh, magic.
And very handy in case of trouble.
You must see this.
I have secured a new meeting place -
a tower by the river.
Come at once.
Hassan will guide you.
Jamilla
Bad news?
On the contrary. It's from a queen.
I haven't seen her for...Oh, it's been much too long.
What about Lady Laeida?
Oh, she's late.
You'll have to take what's left.
She might even like you.
Thank you.
Farewell, my friend.
Say to the Lady Laeida, urgent matters call me.
Why didn't you wait for Laeida?
I have a rendezvous of my own.
Does the master approve?
Is she beautiful?
- The sweetest girl in Baghdad.
- Magnificent. Where?
In a boat tied up to a cypress tree.
Boat, romance in a bouncing boat.
Go away. Spoil the night for someone else.
Never let tomorrow break the spell.
And when autumn breezes hear our sighs, may our lips never say fare thee well.
Keep him near, never far.
Never leave, evening star.
His royal highness, the Prince of Hassir.
He's not the Prince of Hassir.
He's only the prince of liars.
But charming.
You may show him in.
You may enter.
..and when autumn breezes hear our sighs
...may our lips never say...
Jamilla, Lady of the Moonlight.
So we meet again, my prince.
Let me feast my eyes on you.
It really is you.
This is a pleasure.
I've tried giving you up.
How could anything so beautiful be so merciless, so cruel?
We have a week of delirious happiness and suddenly you're gone.
My nights are sleepless, my days burning sands.
I didn't know who you were, where you were.
I shouted the name Jamilla through every palace window.
From Tehran to Mosul.
There wasn't even an echo.
Finally,
I take the long journey home to Hassir eh, my own little kingdom praying for a thunderbolt to explode you out of my heart.
But no thunderbolt.
Charming.
I ride home.
I am desolate.
In my palace,
I have a corner I call the Garden of the Stars.
I like that.
There I sat night after night.
And with my astrologers...
A very stupid lot. They don't know anything about women.
But you do, my prince.
There never was another woman in all the world I couldn't forget but you.
You weren't looking for me in that cafe where they found you.
But how fortunate I was there.
It was the hand of fate.
Kiss me.
- Kiss?
- What else?
I stopped a fight in the street.
I took a poor old battered lad inside and washed the blood off him.
A foul, reeking place, yes, but I...
I couldn't leave him in the street, could I?
And you couldn't keep Laeida waiting, could you?
How could you profane this moment with chatter like that?
After the torture you've made me endure.
Adorable man, don't stop.
Don't ever stop.
I'd rather listen to you telling lies than to all the wise men with all the truth of the ages.
Beard of my ancestor!
No one calls me a liar with impunity.
Who are you, Lady of the Moonlight?
I must know.
You'll never escape me again.
I warn you to leave things as they are, prince.
I never leave things as they are.
The night is enchanting.
Have you ever been on the river when the moon is like this?
The river has romance from here.
Let it be.
That young lout I told you about.
Yes, you washed the blood off him.
He has a boat under a cypress tree.
They're possibly cripples by now.
My boat was built for the queen of Sheba.
Is it written that Solomon never went fishing with her at night?
What are you thinking?
Nothing.
Just listening.
So soft and so lovely.
Isn't your life always soft and lovely?
I don't know.
I've never lived before.
Who built the high wall around you?
My father.
Why?
To keep everybody out.
To keep me inside.
Is no one ever going to be allowed inside?
Oh, yes.
The prince I'm going to marry someday will batter the walls down.
I'd batter the walls down but I'm only a gardener's son.
That's why I'm laughing.
Where is this prince supposed to come form?
Kismet, my fate.
Where else?
You believe in fate, don't you?
I do indeed.
My father thinks he can give romance to fate.
I want a prince for my daughter and nothing else will do.
You've never told me much about your father.
If I said he was a beggar, then you'd think he was a beggar.
No I'm not.
He's the king of beggars.
He's a king of some kind.
Or he couldn't be your father.
If he ever knew the wall wasn't high enough...
He'd kill me.
No, darling, nobody's going to kill you.
If he knew I'd been kissed by a gardener's son...
Oh, well.
The moon is almost gone.
Take me home now, please.
- You wicked...
- Oh, Karsha.
Is this the first time?
Allah, look down.
I'm in love, Karsha.
Love with some poverty stricken camel boy? Your father would kill you.
But you're not going to tell him.
Swear to me me you'll never do this again or I will tell him.
Did you make such promises when you were in love, Karsha?
Go to bed, you.
Besides, if you tell father, he'll cut both our throats.
You get to bed.
You ought to be too ashamed to draw a breath much less sing.
There's no room in my heart for shame.
Who is this young creature anyhow?
Isn't he wonderful?
He can jump but who is he?
He's a gardener's son.
Salt of the world, a gardener's son!
Wait, his father's chief gardener of the palace, the caliph's gardener.
- What gets you up so early?
- I'm not up so early.
- No?
- No.
I haven't been to bed.
Ah, come, my friend, I...
If I'm your friend, why don't...what's that?
Brawling again. Why don't you stop it?
I've prowled mt last prowl.
I've found what I've been looking for.
All thanks to Allah.
So from now on, you can sleep in peace.
- You found what?
- I found a queen.
And such a queen.
What eyes! The kind our poets call deep pools.
Always thought they were crazy before now, but they're not.
I suppose queens do play around the streets of Baghdad at night.
Oh no, not this one.
I had to leap a high wall for my queen.
And here's something to make you more cheerful.
I want you to get in touch with our astrologers and tell them this is a wonderful day for a wedding.
And don't you let them tell you it isn't.
Wedding? Who is she?
What's the difference?
I know what she is.
Her name's Marsinah.
Good name, isn't it?
What about her family?
And her father.
Who is he?
If I told you he's a beggar, you'd think he's a beggar.
He's the king of beggars.
Are you serious?
Very serious.
King of beggars.
You'll have to conjure up some new title for this king of beggars.
But tell me more about the girl.
She's a queen, my friend.
Heart of a queen, mind of a queen, soul of a queen.
I suppose she has a body.
Ravishing, my friend, ravishing.
Well, you didn't mention the body first.
That's promising.
Blessings of the Prophet on your wedding day.
- Long life and great happiness.
- Thank you.
I'd better call off the parade to the mosque.
Oh no, we can't do that.
That would disappoint my people.
But the court's this afternoon.
We'll have to dispense with that.
That would disappoint the Grand Vizier.
What's the matter? You look worried.
I am, very much worried.
You committed a blunder yesterday.
- A very serious blunder.
- Did I?
Name of Allah!
You summoned the Grand Vizier of Baghdad to court like a common thief.
A thief's a thief.
But he's the most powerful man in the empire.
My father let this jackal skin people alive.
Taxes, tributes, plain robbery.
And I'm going to stop it.
But he hasn't even acknowledged your summons.
He'll laugh at you.
And he won't come.
He'll come.
Or I'll go get him myself.
And like doing it.
I can only repeat that he is the most powerful man in the empire.
Achmed.
Let me have this.
I want to keep it.
Her head was resting on your shoulder.
For the empire and her,
I will do my best.
And nothing on earth will stop me.
That was spoken like a king.
And why not?
If a king isn't a king, he's just a yahoo.
Yahoo?
What is a yahoo?
You won't find that word in books, Agha.
Blessings of the Prophet on this day of days.
This brand new caliph, this presumptuous peacock, has the gall to summon me to open court.
When he stands before the mosque today,
I want you to send an arrow through his heart.
But see that the arrow flies straight.
Yes, milord.
If you fail, your head will come off.
I will not fail, milord.
That will be the shortest career any caliph ever had in Baghdad.
- Good morning, father.
- Ah, my little lotus.
Fresh from the hills.
The dew is still on them.
I waited for the sun to open them up.
Enchanting!
- Aren't they gorgeous.
- Go on with you sining.
And how is my little nightingale this morning?
- In good voice?
- Too good.
What's troubling my little Marsinah?
She's not in the mood for learning.
My mind is wandering this morning.
I'm sorry.
Why not? Everyone's mind should wander on a morning like this.
I knew you'd understand, father.
And today, I am not your father.
Today I am the shah of Molla Bashi.
Bah!
And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, your excellency?
Word of thy beauty is blowing down the wind.
I am here to offer gifts at your feet.
It's lovely.
Where did you get it?
I never remember where I get anything.
Now, you sing for me.
Very well.
Bah!
Tell me, tell me little evening star, is this world as lovely as it seems.
Did some magic carpet from afar bring this love to the land of my dreams?
Keep your light forever in his eyes.
Never let tomorrow break the spell.
And when autumn breezes hear us sigh,
- Did you teach her to sing that song?
- I did not.
...lips never say fare thee well.
Where did that song come from?
How do I know?
I dreamed songs like that at her age.
- Where did she learn it?
- I don't know.
Something's happened.
Who is it? What is it?
If there's any trouble, there's no one to blame but you.
You brought her up on fairy tales.
You made fantastic promises.
Built walls around her then went roaring through Baghdad and forgot about her.
Forgot?
You can't forget her any longer.
Do you think she's going to wither away waiting for your fairy tales to come true?
She's waiting for her fate and all its splendor.
The fate for a beggar's daughter is a camel boy.
Silence, misery.
Let no one make hash of fairy tales, my rosebud.
They're the only things in the world that come true.
Alms for the love.
What's wrong with him?
Oh, him.
He worries me.
Alms for the love of Allah.
Everybody's in a gay and festive mood and you sit here.
What ails you?
Guess the rendezvous must have made him sick.
Maybe he drank too much.
I never thought I'd have a problem and no answer for it.
- He has a problem.
- What's that?
Oh. One of those things...
I never thought you'd have a problem.
I know the answer. Don't worry.
For a dozen years
I made golden promises to my little girl.
Suddenly she's not a baby anymore.
What about the golden promises?
A prince and nothing less.
A handsome prince, fabulously rich.
I spread a carpet of dreams before her.
This morning, I'm just a beggar.
Princes live in another world.
My rose will bloom for some camel boy.
He'll never know how sweet she is.
I guess he has been drinking too much.
It's the Caliph.
That man will never make another attempt of the kind.
I made sure of that.
Also, he can't answer any questions, can he?
Dead men tell no tales.
Feisal.
What was that gossip of yours about the big people?
About the Grand Vizier. He was invited to the court like any criminal.
That's what I said.
I think he just replied to the invitation.
He came within inches of being ruler of the empire.
I could tie my chariot to such a star.
- Lord of the Grand Illusion.
- Or we just do nothing.
There's only one place for the loveliest of daughters.
The household of the greatest of men.
The Grand Vizier?
You're closer to him today than you will be in a thousand years.
Now, by the glories of Paradise to come,
Allah hath opened the gate of action to me.
Lead me to a bazaar where they trade in royal silks.
Jewels from India, beads from Damascus, sashes from Constantinople, turban cloth from Vocarra.
My Marsinah was born to make a palace dance.
Allah, save us.
That, my friends, is the golden promise of a king, and the word of a king is good.
Water, water, it's good.
I never knew it was like that.
Yeah well, I had a bath.
Say, Bobo, why are we hiding here in a public bathing place?
Don't worry. This is one place they'd never look for us.
- No?
- Police, police!
Police, police!
They're here, the police. They're here.
Why not police?
There was an attempt on the caliph's life this morning.
They're looking for accomplices everywhere.
Attendant.
Attendant.
Yes?
Yes, your highness.
One of my men tells me the police are here.
They're looking for a beggar for robbery.
Tell the captain I wish a word with him.
- At once.
- What?
There's a wise proverb:
Seize the horns of the charging bull.
Your highness, the captain of police.
Why do you enter a place where weary travellers relax?
Must the peace of the hammam be disturbed?
- It's a matter of duty.
- Duty?
In my country, I allow no such impertinence. What duty?
We are looking for a thief.
Must have stolen the sacred jewels.
No, milord.
Apparel of great value.
Trinkets a rat steals and a captain becomes a ferret?
In my country my captains don't annoy visiting royalty chasing petty thieves.
Look int he yard.
See if my elephant is still there.
Your highness, I did not know.
You didn't know.
What's happened to Baghdad?
My last visit here, eleven years ago, when I was a day's journey away, the police of Baghdad knew I was coming.
Your highness, no elephant.
By the dried skin of the hyena.
Have I come a thousand parasangs to visit the Grand Vizier only to be robbed?
I demand safe conduct. and another elephant.
If your soul isn't too weasel to stop this rat catching, send a messenger to Mansur's palace.
And say the Prince of Hassir has arrived with toot sweet.
On matters of great importance.
Very well, you shall have your escort and you shall have your elephant.
But now...
- I want privacy.
- Very good, your highness.
Is that carpet for us?
No, that's for the elephant.
Tell the merchant the tax is direct.
Unless they pay it immediately, it will be my personal pleasure to roll their heads through their bazaar.
What do you want?
How large a guard shall I prepare for your visit to the royal court?
You should know better than that, captain.
- But, milord.
- Forget the summons to court.
This young peacock is beginning to spread his tail.
He just might send the police after me.
It'll give him a chance to find out I'm the police.
What is it?
His royal highness, the Prince of Hassir.
Hassir, Hassir? He must come from the far ends of the world.
That's the farthest corner of the empire, my lord.
Did he send a messenger for an appointment?
No, milord.
These heathens have customs but no manners.
Yes, milord.
Let's give him a royal reception.
Let's amaze him with it.
I wonder what this barbarian wants to have travelled so far.
His royal highness, the Prince of Hassir.
I'll wager he's been preparing a long speech all the way across the desert.
A long, horrible speech.
Welcome, your highness.
A wide brow proclaims an open heart.
May heaven trust me, your lordship.
I never ask prosperity where it comes from.
Right, milord.
The devil could do you a good turn now and then.
That they may be seated.
I have a contemptibly small gift.
My caravan is delayed.
So if you will accept this in the meantime,
I would be most honored.
This is exquisite.
This is really fine.
- Good hands made this.
- Very young hands.
Is the design a copy?
Copy, milord? It's a creation.
She did all of it.
She?
It's a gift from the loveliest girl in Hassir.
Perhaps in the empire.
If I guess right, there's a mission you want me to perform.
- Is there, milord?
- Yes.
You want me to propose the lovely young girl for the caliph's household.
Milord...
But you've come at a very bad moment.
The caliph does not love me as he should.
At the moment.
Milord...
If I wish to visit the caliph,
I will visit the caliph.
Splendid, splendid, your gift honors me.
Will your highness honor me by accepting eh...
These?
I am overwhelmed, your lordship.
Alfife.
The living isn't very good on the journey from Hassir to Baghdad, is it?
I once knew a magician in your province.
His name was Abdul Laka.
How is he?
The one with a beard like a field of ripe corn?
No, no, no, he had a short eh... scruffy wisp of a beard.
Oh, that Abdul. The brigand.
He stole so brazenly, my executioners had to cut his hands off.
- No.
- Bled to death in public.
That should teach him a lesson.
Let's drink to poor Abdul.
We have the finest wine, music and dancing.
- Dancing?
- You like dancing?
It's the flowers on the mountaintop.
Then you're about to see the finest in the kingdom. I have scores of them.
My kind of dancers don't come in scores.
- No?
- No.
I'll wager you haven't anything like this in your pastures.
The girl who made you the gift makes these look like swamphens.
Swamphens? These girls were selected from every royal house in the empire.
Milord, my little girl would be a queen among these.
Great dancing takes brains and heart.
Alfife.
I have a great dancer.
She has brains but no heart.
Say to her gracious majesty
I have a distinguished visitor.
The prestige of my court is sinking.
Say that I am pleading that she save the glory of the court.
Your ladyship?
Well?
I'm commanded to request that you appear in the hall of the white columns and dance.
I'm very sorry.
I'm not in the mood for dancing.
But it is for a distinguished guest.
Must I call Hassan?
We've been robbed, lord.
Alfife, one moment, please.
The royal merchants have been robbed.
They want justice.
Tell them to wait.
I have troubles enough.
Quiet, quiet.
Her ladyship is not in the mood.
Salt of my ancestors! A man who cracks a whip over an empire.
If I cracked a whip over this lady, she'd take it right out of my hands.
It takes a great man to admit it.
She's a gift from Macedonia.
I can't offend Macedonia.
That sounds more like the caliph than your lordship.
Well, upon my soul!
You all stay. Watch the dancing and have some wine.
Why do you continue to deprive us of the pleasure of your incomparable dancing?
Didn't Alfife tell you?
Doesn't the look of desperation in my eyes soften your mood just a little?
I'm in a very pleasant mood.
Very.
I have a charming and distinguished guest.
It's your luck that he pleases you.
Pleases me?
He scorns my dancing girls as swamphens.
Oh, a man of judgement.
Lady Jamilla, I have granted you exceptional privileges.
You granted nothing.
You have an agreement with Macedonia that I should do that thing.
And you have agreed never to come to this tower except at my invitation.
I'm waiting patiently for the invitation.
And as far as dancing is concerned...
You have ladies who dance when you strike the gong.
I don't.
But, Lady Jamilla...
I give your lordship my answer politely.
It's outrageous hospitality.
He's had a long hard journey and we mustn't disappoint the Prince of Hassir.
The Prince of Hassir?
Now, don't try to trick me.
There's no such thing under the sun as the Prince of Hassir.
I'm absolutely certain.
There's no such man.
There's nothing more to be said.
Some day I'm going to cut your head off even if I lose Macedonia.
Hassan has something important to tell you.
Hassan? I'll see him.
She says there is no Prince of Hassir.
Lady of the Moonlight.
Lady of the what?
Well, she came down from some celestial spot.
She didn't come down. She came up.
Marvelous.
Pity custom forbids my telling her so.
We are bigger than our customs.
Tell her so.
Don't be afraid.
She doesn't bite strangers.
Your lordship is great indeed.
Lady of the Moonlight.
You are ravishing.
I warned you to leave things as they were.
How could you do this terrible thing to me?
What have I done?
When you said you shouted my name in the windows of all the palaces,
I knew it was nonsense but I loved it.
To me, you were all the romance of old Baghdad.
When I was bored to exhaustion,
I could escape and find you.
You were priceless.
Jamilla, listen to me.
No, no, no.
This is farewell, my friend.
What a shame.
I am just as much the Prince of Hassir as I ever was.
As much, no more.
You're a charming liar at times.
Don't be absurd.
The Grand Vizier doesn't roll out the red carpet for stray vagabonds.
When my royal blood is up, no one can deny me. And no one does.
Nothing has changed.
You mean you hoaxed your way in here?
This is magnificent. You took your life in your hands to see me.
A poor risk for such a reward.
Then I must see you tonight.
You must tell me all about this before you forget any of it.
What you said, every word.
What the great man said.
Oh, this is wonderful!
I'll laugh in his face every time I look at him.
You'll never laugh in his face again.
We're leaving tonight you and I for my Garden of the Stars.
If you will accept this little gift, beautiful dancer, it may remind you of the pleasure you gave a weary traveller.
You're too gracious, your highness.
Well?
Well.
She's a great artist, milord.
Then we'll hear no more about the maid of Hassir.
Of course, she's much younger.
But she's queen of them all.
You're not suggesting
I get rid of Jamilla?
No, no, no, my lord.
But of course, fate moves queens into place and out again so...
You never can tell.
We're too shaking with Macedonia right now, aren't we?
I didn't come here to give you the shakes.
I just wanted you to see the girl, that's all.
To see her dance. And when she sings, my lord, the angels are still.
In the name of the seven burning lakes, do you expect me to travel all the way to Hassir to see this paragon?
No, she's here with me in Baghdad.
Then before you start singing her praises all over again,
I'll send for her in state.
That's something I must do myself, if you don't mind.
No, anything you want, of course.
The superlative hand that fashioned the gift shall have something from me.
Here.
Give this to the miracle of all girls and say to her that never before in it's history has this palace held its breath as it does now.
And what's her name?
- Marsinah.
- Marsinah.
And now gentlemen, to the Princess Marsinah.
This needlework!
What material!
I poured all my love into it.
Oh, Karsha.
I like it myself.
Listen.
Listen. Oh, he sounds happy.
Sounds like an extra glass of wine or a new fairy tale.
Here, you come take that off.
That's not for everyday.
Please, Karsha, I want father to see it.
Ah, my blossoming flower, greetings, my unblossoming cactus.
Salam, salam, salam.
Happiness. Where did you get it?
To those of royal blood, one never asks,
"Where did you get it?"
Those pearls.
Gorgeous.
Who was it said every son's a blessing, every daughter a desolation?
Who'd dare say anything so wicked?
I wouldn't barter you this day for all the sons of all the guardians, all the nobles or... am I talking like a king?
Who went crazy.
Silence, cactus.
Or I'll call my slaves to chop your head off.
How would my little princess like to live in a palace?
With pillows of ostrich plumes, in courts of marble with ceilings of molten gold.
She'd go blind in the eye, enslaved.
Come on, slave, the feast. Ha, quiet.
Your wishes, princess?
I shall have a sherbert.
In my costliest china bowl.
With exquisite spoons made from the pear tree.
Here is pheasant from Mazanderland.
Here are the choicest bites of the wild antelope.
I get the bellyache just listening to them.
So, I go roaring through Baghdad, do I?
Such a roar was never heard through Baghdad.
Please, father, tell me what did you do?
I have had wine with the greatest man in Arabia.
Wine, music, he even brought out his dancing girls.
I looked at them, I thought of you.
Milord, I said, these are swamphens.
He said, "Off with his head."
I said, "Wait", said I, "Wait."
Not until you've seen the Princess Marsinah and so...
He sends you this.
With his compliments.
Now, my lotus, my little pigeon, you are to dance for the Grand Vizier!
I?
I dance for the Grand Vizier?
I promised you when the time came, a king should bow his turban to the dust for you.
All day your father has been stepping from one mountain peak to another.
But don't be uneasy, my little Marsinah.
You'll dazzle them all.
Open up in the name of justice.
This way, quick!
In here, both of you.
Quick!
The police, police.
- I knew they wouldn't be far behind you.
- Stay there.
- The robber.- The rascal.- That's my tunic
- My shoes.- My ring.- My turban.
- He stole my purse.
- Quiet.
They're lying dogs, captain.
These clothes in this shack?
These clothes are mine and those too.
You can have them back. Here...
Come along, you're under arrest.
Alfife, this is an outrage.
I'm a man of religion and peace.
Three doomsday break if I lie.
Father.
I'll be back, my little one.
Don't worry.
I'll see my friend, the Grand Vizier.
He'll send them all where they belong.
Come along.
I knew it. I knew it.
Karsha.
- Karsha.
- Come, my little one.
No, no, I must get help.
The king of beggars.
- Gardener?
- Yes?
- What is it?
- This young lady wants to see you.
Wants to see me?
Yes, please.
A flower from the caliph's garden.
Is that what she was?
Here.
Thank you.
That has a blessing.
Where can I find your son?
My son?
This garden is the only wife I ever had.
Thousands of these flowers are my only children.
Oh, see what you've done.
Forgive me.
Milord...
My friend, I didn't believe it when they told me.
I've seen princes made and unmade pretty fast in my time.
But never with a speed like this.
Go ahead.
The accusers may speak one at a time.
Quiet.
I have heard the accusations.
And what has his highness of Hassir to say?
And what of the magician?
Can he juggle his way out of this?
Come, speak.
Milord, when the trick fails, when it's exposed, the magician's a poor thing.
The other gift, the bracelet you gave the princess, milord.
Oh, no, hang it around your neck again.
I did enjoy you.
You surprised a man pretty hard to surprise.
And you remember poor Abdul?
Yes.
You know the law.
If a man steals, you cut off his hands in front of his victims.
My hands!
Actually, you'll cut my heart out.
If a man knows the law, he should think of that before he steals
Milord!
It is no pleasure to see rare talent cut off before its time.
But it is so written in the law.
There can be no compromise.
What is it?
A message from the imperial palace.
I have come from the all highest of the center of the universe to give his compliments to you.
He has sent a very substantial number of his royal guard.
His serene highness is thus assured that you will be conducted to his presence in a manner befitting your exulted position and the distinction of your house.
Did you say royal guard?
By the express orders of the caliph.
Your palace is now completely surrounded by your escort.
Milord.
Milord, shall we proceed?
What are we waiting for?
Cut off his hands and dismiss the court.
Milord, wait, these hands can serve you.
Silence, mountebank.
But I can tell you of my master in Morocco.
He toppled the king off the throne.
When everything else had failed.
Halt.
My friend, your story will have to be exceedingly good.
Or it will be exceedingly short.
It's both, milord. It's good and short.
But...
I need my hands to tell it.
And now, what did your master of Morocco do?
While the king was amazed at the lightning in one hand, the other drove a dagger through his heart.
Proceed.
I heard the king's messenger.
The words sounded fair but...
Your lordship is trapped.
Before the mosque this morning, a mans' head rolled in the gutter.
He'd fumbled his job.
You told me yourself how much the caliph loved you.
Of course, you know you've just written your death warrant.
Unless I can serve you.
What you want done in Baghdad today, only these hands can do.
Get me before the king today and you will rule the empire by sundown.
- You have courage, my friend.
- I have for this, milord.
I'm keeping a golden promise.
I'd rather die than break it.
- A promise to whom?
- To my daughter, milord.
Dear to me beyond the hopes of Paradise.
The highest place in the world I've promised her since she was a baby.
If you serve me today,
I'll make you a prince of Islam, and she can have anything she wants.
If I send this peacock to Paradise one split second later, I'll be dead.
You risk that, of course.
Now, what do you want?
This and it must be done rapidly.
My Marsinah brought here in state.
I must see her installed not as one of your dancers but as queen.
As head of your household.
But what about the tiger cat?
Leave the tiger cat to me.
Another assignment in magic?
You met the lady for only a brief moment.
It was love at first sight, milord.
I can always tell.
Very well, my friend, very well.
Your princess Marsinah shall be brought here in state.
And now some wine.
That means good things.
Like a bursting sunrise.
You've heard many fables, child.
But the sands never lie.
What's that?
Have you risen from the dead?
Marsinah, my child, there's nothing to be distressed about.
A word to my friend, the Grand Vizier, and those hounds went off yelping.
Tears, my poor baby?
Has this croaking old parchment frightened you?
I've good news for you.
The greatest of all news.
You are to be queen of the household of the Grand Vizier.
Think of it.
The Princess Marsinah.
Not just one of a score of dancing girls.
But queen of them all.
Don't lie to her anymore.
I do not lie, cactus.
Before the sun goes down, she'll be the greatest lady in Baghdad.
- Why must you make life so horrible?
- Marsinah, it is written.
I love you, father, but I can't obey.
What's this? What's happened?
She's fallen in love.
That's what's happened.
Who? When?
I'll send him floating down the river without his head. Where is he?
He told her his father's the royal gardener but he lied.
The royal gardener has no son.
I want to put you on the mountaintop but you choose the gutter.
Don't you see how miserable I am?
My little Marsinah,
I built these walls to protect you.
Every day of your life,
I've tried to bring a world of dream in here.
And now those dreams are coming true.
I know what life with the gardener's son will mean.
Slavery, poverty, ugliness.
A few short years and life will be over.
That's not true.
Leave me alone.
- Captain of the guard.
- Father.
Bring them in.
Don't make me do this.
For this I've risked my life a dozen times today.
For this I descended a bottomless pit.
The bargain is made.
You mean I...
I'm to marry a...
I'm giving you the place in the sun
I promised you.
Deliver this maid to the Grand Vizier.
They don't have to touch me.
I'll go.
When will she arrive?
Just before sunset.
After the gardener's son has battered the wall down.
The messenger has returned.
You may speak.
You majesty, this beggar we've been searching for seems to have vanished.
Ridiculous.
Beggars don't vanish from Baghdad.
He must be found and found today.
In your search, did you learn anything about him?
He calls himself king of beggars.
He masquerades at night as the Prince of Hassir.
He is also quite a magician.
Double your efforts.
Set a watch around the house where he lives.
You may go.
You're not serious about this wedding after what you've just heard?
Nothing can change my mind.
I shall bring her here myself.
In the name of Destiny, you...
It's insane to risk your neck in the streets.
You can send a thousand men with me if you like.
But the gardener's son is going to lead her through the royal gardens.
I'll tell her nothing till we're here.
I want the memory of this day to live in her heart forever.
I'm ready, milord.
Where's the princess?
- She's being costumed.
- Good.
Your appearance in court has been arranged.
The caliph has accepted your petition.
And he...
What are you laughing at?
There's vast excitement among the ladies because of the Princess Marsinah.
Her highness, Queen Jamilla, refuses to leave the tower, milord.
You hear? She won't leave the tower.
There's a good deal at stake.
I think she'll have to.
Right, but what are you going to do, put her under a spell?
Exactly.
As soon as you've formally dethroned her.
There are formalities, milord.
All right.
Stay here. I'll take care of the formalities.
Don't you dare come up here.
Or I'll drive a dagger through your heart.
But, Lady Jamilla...
I shall stay in this tower as long as it pleases me.
And only when I decide to leave, shall I leave.
Oh, you decide.
Remember I told you I would cut your throat even if I lost Macedonia.
Now the time has come.
- I'll call out the...
- Never mind.
I have decided to leave.
You what?
Jasmina.
Marsinah.
Prince Charming.
Let no one make hash of fairy tales, my rosebud.
Your veil, please.
You should have brought a poet to talk about her.
Arise, my dear.
And be honored.
From now on, this distinguished young lady is queen of the household.
There will be a marriage ceremony later in the day.
A word to your father before
I lead you to the tower.
Once, milord, there grew a single rose in a beggar's garden.
He swore it should never bloom for some camel boy.
How do you do things like this?
Magician.
You brought this girl here?
Yes, I brought her here.
So that I would be free?
It was a bargain.
I was going to tear the place to pieces.
And I would have.
If I hadn't seen you.
I told you you couldn't escape me.
Can a woman escape her destiny?
The name of Jamilla still echos in palace windows.
And the Garden of the Stars is written in the sand.
I'll come back for you in an hour.
Another hour here?
I'm a deposed queen.
Forgive me.
First I've a duty to perform.
It's not as simple as I thought.
Was is this duty?
My part of the bargain.
If I live through it,
I'll be here.
You'll live through anything.
There's a secret entrance.
My slave will be looking for you.
Near the eastern gate.
If you don't see me within the hour,
I'll be dead.
You'll be alive when the man in the moon is forgotten, my beloved.
The Lady of the Moonlight will be waiting.
Come quickly.
Did I hear you laugh?
Oh, no.
Why tears at this great moment?
You've reached about the highest place a woman can have in this kingdom.
What good is a high place if your heart breaks?
We women are not supposed to have hearts, my dear.
Who was he?
Nobody.
A gardener's son.
I see.
You do strange things in Hassir.
Hassir?
Yes, your province.
I've never heard of the place.
But you have been formally presented by the Prince of Hassir.
I've never been out of Baghdad.
But who's the man who brought you?
You mean my father.
- Your father?
- Yes.
He didn't bring me from anyplace but the shack we live in.
But who is your father if he's not the prince of Hassir?
My father is a beggar.
A beggar?
Yes, he sits on a rock before the beggar's mosque.
This magnificent man a beggar.
Oh, how wonderful.
How wonderful! A beggar!
And his daughter a queen.
What fun.
Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you.
Come on, cheer up.
Hear that?
Come here.
The song of ceremony for the new queen.
You're supposed to sing it.
I...
We expect it.
Sing for them.
Like the willow in the wind,
I have a weeping.
Like the willow in the wind moaning low
Like a willow leaf, love is ever brief
So my heart weeps away never sleeping
Weeps away like the night winds that blow
Like a willow leaf
Love will come to grief
Only yesterday spring was here to stay
The voice is good.
I could do with a happier song.
Youth can be sad without rhyme or reason.
Now that I've signed the marriage agreement,
I've fulfilled my part of the bargain.
See that you don't fail to do yours.
Not I, milord.
If I don't juggle you out of trouble,
I've done nothing for her.
That's true, that's true. Alfife.
Double the guard around the tower.
And what's so amusing?
I was thinking if I fail with the caliph, they'll kill me.
If I don't then your lordship will do it.
I might not.
Milord, I've an inheritance.
My father lived to be 100, my grandfather 110.
They won't be expecting me in either place for years.
They won't be ready for me.
Find courage, my friend, find courage.
Kismet.
His lordship, the exalted
Grand Vizier of Baghdad.
Let every tongue be silent.
His serene highness, commander of the faithful, lion of the imperial forest, rider of the spotless horse, shadow of Allah on earth, ruler of all Arabia.
If it please the all highest...
The ruler of faithful is not to be addressed except at his own request.
As you well know.
Your case is third on the list, your lordship.
But to summon me here on a few hour's notice, shows contempt for my great office.
In the name of dignity and high justice,
I demand time to prepare myself against the accusations, no matter what they may be.
I will always listen when a man says,
"In the name of justice."
I'll grant you the time you ask.
And I'm going to tell you what you're accused of so you'll know how to prepare.
But during the time I'm granting you, all duties and power of office is stripped from you.
The seal is worthless.
But this is outrageous.
You are accused of brutal taxation, robbery of the poor, years of corruption.
My witnesses are here by thousands.
And I have it from their own lips throughout the kingdom.
When you have an answer you think we should hear, let us know.
When your serene highness apologizes to me, may I hope that he does it as publicly as this.
I will not keep your fate a secret I promise you.
Number one on the divan program, is the case of Alwah, the woodchopper against Wapu the barber.
Which is the barber?
I am the barber, your excellency,
I am the barber.
State your case.
Great keeper of all justice, this miserable woodchopper, he pays my barbershop a visit.
He inquires how much will be the charge to shave him and his friend.
I stated a most reasonable price.
I shaved the rascal and I said,
"Now, bring in your friend."
And what does he do? He brings in his ass and says, "This is my friend."
Well, Alwah?
Most high and just,
Two moons ago,
I brought to this b-barber a load of wood on the back of my friend here.
He bargained for all of the wood on the ass' back.
In those very words.
So this hard-hearted b-barber he took also my pack saddle saying that too was made of wood.
He said...
Agha, have this overly smart barber shave the woodchopper's friend.
The next case is a petition from a stranger.
It is a tradition in Baghdad to hear strangers without delay.
The man is a magician from far off Morocco.
And craves assignment as conjurer to the imperial court.
This magician is the beggar we've been searching the city for.
The next case is your father-in-law.
The Prince of Hassir?
That roustabout who kicked me and called me a yahoo?
My father-in-law.
The heavens are having fun.
Perhaps not.
His petition came from the valets of the Grand Vizier.
Let's be on guard.
I shall not weary your serene highness.
I shall conjure before the eyes of the lion of the imperial desert only such feats of magic.
He's gone.
He's gone.
Now, oh rider of the spotless horse
On my right is this beautiful young lady and here, the handsome lad she loves. but it's springtime, your highness and with your royal permission.
Let me out of here!
Hey, let me out of here!
Let me out.
Thus demonstrating to the all highest that nothing in the world is real.
Excellent, excellent.
And now, oh, prince of true believers,
I will show you a feat so incredible it has staggered all the rulers of the world.
But the king must watch closely.
May a stranger beg humbly to approach?
The king's eyesight is excellent.
Proceed.
What use if the king can't see?
Proceed.
Watch the kerchief closely, milord.
- See amazing things it can see.
- Halt!
Serene highness,
I am a failure. My chance is a nothing unless you examine the kerchief closely.
Stay where you are.
Let him come up.
Allah reward thee, commander of the faithful.
Before your eyes,
I will produce a forest and put it on the mountaintop.
I now summon the gods of thunder.
- And from these changing colors...
- You will produce a knife.
You showed me the trick last night.
Remember the yahoo?
Don't kill him. Bring him to me.
Bring him to me.
I want silence.
Let every tongue be silent.
This is the second attempt today.
It is clear life is in the hands of fate.
Praise Allah.
Before this fool's execution,
I want him to hear something.
You were told of a royal wedding today.
That wedding will still take place.
I've combed the corners of Baghdad for this man.
And while he was plotting with my enemies,
I was arranging to make his daughter queen of the empire.
That girl must disappear immediately.
The Grand Vizier, stop him.
Stop him. Don't let him get away.
- Don't worry about him.
- Don't let the Grand Vizier get away.
Our chancellor will now give you the order of the day.
- Proceed.
- Guards, get him!
Where's Marsinah? She goes with us.
Quick, lead the way.
Come back, you fool.
He'll kill you.
Admit no one until we get the beggar's daughter out of here.
And his highness can try and find us in the wilderness of the desert.
We'll soon find out who rules in Baghdad.
Marsinah.
Marsinah.
Here's the key. Let me open it.
Marsinah.
The Grand Vizier.
Where's the girl?
Where is she?
Alfife, call the guards.
Alfife, the guards!
Alfife.
He died laughing, Excellency.
We'll see if you can do the same.
I've heard enough. Bring him in.
Yes, the most beautiful pearl in my entire kingdom.
Release him.
You may rise.
What have you to say?
Your highness,
You expect to be hanged, of course?
Thou art the lord of my neck.
Hanging is much to easy a punishment for you.
Milord, torture?
You love Baghdad, don't you?
With the breath of my life, milord.
Rather a dead beggar in Baghdad than a living monarch of the wilderness.
Have you ever seen Hassir?
Hassir is the dullest, drowsiest, most desolate corner of the empire.
So...
You're exiled.
To Hassir.
And if you're in Baghdad one second after sundown, that second will be your last.
Exiled?
From Baghdad?
- Oh, milord, bring on the hangman.
- Silence!
From this moment, you are our Prince of Hassir.
Prince of Hassir?
You had a lot of fun being Prince of Hassir.
Oh, most exalted,
I will make this forgotten spot into a paradise.
The desert shall blossom like the rose.
The odor of decay will vanish before a breeze of orange blossoms.
There will thy name be honored.
Yes, but if you're caught in Baghdad one second after sundown, that second will be your last.
They're coming, Jamilla. Karsha.
He's coming, Karsha!
Jamilla!
Marsinah!
Father.
Marsinah.
Father.
You're alive?
Yes and so are all my promises.
Round is the moon, 'round goes the moon, the wind and the rain to the moon 'round again,
Karsha.
Father, it's the gardener's son.
But why do you kneel?
It's the revered one, the rider of the spotless horse.
The Caliph of Baghdad himself.
The ruler of all Arabia.
Why, it...
Marsinah.
Now, say goodbye to your father.
Father.
My baby.
Blessings of the Prophet on your wedding day, my little one.
Your highness, the sun goes down.
Your wedding gift, my lotus.
And may Allah smile on you both forever.
Look.
Well, it's...
It's the most beautiful pearl
I've ever seen.
Hurry up, man. I thought you were lost.
All Baghdad
Well, wishes are horses.
Beggars can ride.
The daughter of a beggar
The daughter of a king.
Farewell, Baghdad.
If you're ever again in trouble, send for me.
Sundown, your highness.
This way.
"The canterville ghost.
Universally renowned as the most fearsome
Of all english phantoms is the notorious ghost
Of sir simon de canterville.
This remarkable apparition has manifested itself
In a spectacular variety of forms and guises,
Each more awe-Inspiring than the other,
Exhibiting the same flair for the theatrical
That reputedly characterized sir simon himself.
The origin of this apparition, so legend has it,
Dates from a fateful stag hunt in the year 1634..."
Out of the way.
Bellman! Bugler!
Thrust-Ho, sir valentine.
Anthony de canterville!
Anthony, what have i done to thee?
It's my arm, sir valentine.
Thank heavens
'tis but thine arm.
Why hidest thou in the brush
Like a rabbit?
I
- I was plucking bluebells.
Bluebells?
A manful pursuit for a canterville
In the hunting season?
More manful than you would imagine, sir valentine.
Methinks 'twas
The wrong stag we flushed.
My bride-To-Be!
Eleanor?
Eleanor!
How couldst thou, eleanor?
Thou art promised to me.
Promised to thee no longer, sir valentine.
She was wed to me at yestereve.
Wed?
Thou dare steal her from me
Knowing she was pledged?
Yea.
I shall expect satisfaction from thee, sir,
At bolton manor within the hour.
Anthony!
Thou wouldst not be so bold, sir valentine,
Were i possessed of my good right arm.
A pretty excuse to snivel out of it.
Simon!
My brother will give thee satisfaction.
Simon, the honor of the cantervilles
Has been questioned.
What?
Wherefore dost thy dagger reek with his blood?
My sword arm is pierced to the bone.
Take thou my signet ring and fight in my stead.
Who? Me?
Who else?
Come, come, simon,
Pick up the gauntlet and fling it in his face.
Whose face?
Sir valentine's.
Give me thy ring.
But 'twas anthony who ran off with my betrothed.
He danced.
He should pay the piper.
A canterville has been slighted.
And by one of an upstart brood,
Honored scarce 200 years.
I choose the weapon of chivalry
The lance.
The lance?
Yea.
I'll teach thee a kinsman is a kinsman.
What keeps the popinjay?
My gauntlets, dunderhead.
By hereward the wake,
I'll pin him on my lance like a capon on a spit.
There he is, sir.
There, sir.
Where is thine armor, valentine?
Alack, sir simon, i suffered the most dreadful mishap.
So i felt obliged to give way to my cousin,
The bold sir guy.
Shall we be on with the merriment,
My noble marshal?
But faith, valentine, it was you. ah, a kinsman is a kinsman.
Sound the order of combat.
May the right prevail.
Sir simon! He's breaking off.
Coward! After him, sir guy!
Fetch him back on your lance!
Aye! Harpoon him!
Hoist him high!
Poltroon!
I tell thee 'tis no disgrace, my son.
Be thankful thou hast a brother to wear thy signet,
And such a chivalrous brother.
I recall the day i wore my brother edward's signet
Before good queen bess.
Unhorsed six men in a single hour in this very armor.
By saint peter of the fetters.
Simon must go a long way to excel that!
Where is he?
Who?
That lily-Livered son of yours
Who skittered off in terror before the lance.
Cowardice? In one who bears on his neck
The birthmark of the cantervilles? Ha! Preposterous!
Is it?
Then what might be lurking in yon alcove?
A fat quail, perchance?
No son of mine cowers in any alcove.
No? Then milord
Can assuredly have no objection
To the sealing up of the door
With stone and mortar.
I most certainly can!
I've too great a regard for my house.
For your house, milord,
Or your son?
Giles, thomas! Fetch the stonemasons!
Hasten!
Have we not had enough
Of this play-Acting, sir valentine?
One never leaves the theater, milord,
Until the curtain has fallen.
Continue.
Father!
It is i, thy son.
Forsooth, a fat quail indeed.
Or was it the wind that whistled down the flue?
I heard no sound.
Spare me! Spare me!
Pose the last stone.
Pose it, i say!
But, milord,
'Twas meant only in jest.
Leave my house!
It is thy son!
Go!
Simon de canterville,
Because thou hast shamed thy heritage
And dishonored thy proud blood,
In that tomb of thine own choosing
Shall lie thy whited bones,
And may thy craven spirit
Walk the halls of canterville castle
Until a kinsman shall wear thy signet. and perform for thee
The brave deed thou didst fail to perform
For thy kinsman.
"Thus goes the legend of the canterville ghost.
And today, after
300 years of terror,
Canterville castle stands silent and deserted
A mute, foreboding monument to the fearsome phantom
Who stalks those silent halls."
Auntie! Auntie!
I just saw the ghost!
The ghost? Where?
On the roof of the castle.
That was the tinsmith, darling.
I asked Sr. Peabody to engage him
To mend the waterspouts.
Oh. But why, auntie?
Nobody lives there.
Jessica, we're turning the castle over
To a platoon of american soldiers.
American soldiers?
But, good gracious,
Can they live in the castle when it's haunted?
Your family did, darling, till 20 years ago.
I know, but, auntie
We're ready to leave now, ma'am.
The helpers have arrived?
They'll meet us at the castle, ma'am.
You're going, auntie?
Of course.
Guests are coming.
Noblesse oblige.
Madame, there's sure to be a downpour.
I'm afraid there will be.
You know, auntie,
You're not well.
Oh, very well.
Extend my regrets to the soldiers
And tell them i'll come to see them
As soon as i'm able.
Yes, ma'am.
Auntie, what does it mean
Noblesse oblige?
Oh, that's just an expression, darling.
But what does it mean?
You were going out because of it.
Noblesse oblige is french.
It means-Well, you're lady jessica de canterville,
And i'm the honorable
Sra. Polverdine.
Those of us who are nobly born must prove themselves worthy of it
By being ever kind and gracious
And thoughtful for others,
And by living not to take,
But to give.
That is our obligation.
So, when guests arrive, why, we must welcome them
And see that they enjoy their stay with us.
Do you understand, child?
Yes.
Auntie, these americans,
Will they be cowboys and indians?
Some of them, i dare say.
Auntie, what does one do to make indians welcome?
Jessica! You're not thinking of going.
Yes. Someone should make our guests welcome.
But aren't you afraid of the ghost?
Yes, auntie.
And you still think you ought to go?
Yes, auntie. It is my castle, isn't it?
You're only 6, darling.
I know, but, auntie,
Noblesse oblige.
It-It starts when you're born, doesn't it?
Run along, then.
Thank you, auntie.
Stay close to Sra. Umney.
Don't worry about me, auntie.
Ghosts almost never come out in the daytime.
Ok, everybody, we're moving in!
Welcome to canterville castle, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Hello, mister.
Some spread.
Pleased to meet you.
What a place!
Hello.
Hiya, Sr. Canterville.
Why. pipe the guy in the tin suit.
Hey, this is ok.
You ain't kiddin'.
Say, all this room in one room.
Wonder when the trains come in.
Hey, this place kind of reminds me
Of the old manhattan boxing arena.
How would you know, slap-Happy?
The only thing you saw in the area
Was the ceiling when they carried you out.
Well,
Not bad.
Not half bad, by jove.
Pup tents are ok for the hoi polloi.
Me, i prefer the comforts of the hearth.
Yes, sir, without the simple luxuries of life
A comfortable chair, a cheery blaze, and a spot of brandy,
I simply wilt away and perish.
Take your big feet off of there, williams,
Or i'll perish you.
Get a good night's sleep, men.
You'll need it.
You want me, Sr. Peabody, i'll be at headquarters in the village.
Yes, sir, captain.
Good night.
Attention!
Remember, sergeant, this is not our property.
Yes, sir.
Carry on.
Williams, you don't do that at home, do you?
Yeah.
Well, don't do it here!
I beg your pardon.
Shall i serve tea now, gentlemen?
Tea?
Sra. Umney thought after your journey
You'd be a bit done in.
All right, then. Thanks.
Very good, sir.
Now, listen, fellas.
It says here in the little instruction book,
"When you're guests of the british,
You gotta act like you'd expect them to act
If they came to america."
Remember what it says about food.
Here.
"If a britisher exhorts you to eat
Or join him in a spot of tea, go easy.
It may be his ration for one week,
Spread out just to show you his hospitality."
Excuse me, gentlemen,
But lady jessica would like to say good evening.
Lady jessica?
Oh, boy!
Yes. Lady jessica de canterville,
The owner of the castle.
Well, tell her we'd be honored.
Very good, sir.
What do you say to a dame that's a lady?
Do you have to kiss her hand?
Now, watch it.
Lady jessica de canterville.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Holy smoke! It's a midget.
No. It's a half-Pint.
How do you do?
I know you've come a long way,
And i want you all to know
I'm glad you're here.
And i do so hope you'll enjoy your stay
In my castle.
Thank you, my lady,
And may i say on behalf of my compatriots
That we're very grateful for your hospitality.
Yeah, likewise.
You're ok, your majesty.
Thank you, gentlemen.
You'll excuse the fellas, i hope.
We thought lady jessica was, uh. i thought a girl had to be married before she was a lady.
Oh, dear, no.
A lady is a lady when she behaves like one,
My auntie says.
Your auntie is quite right.
Which of you are indians?
He's an indian.
Yes? To which tribe do you belong?
He's a hoboken indian.
I don't believe i've ever read about that tribe.
Tea is served, gentlemen.
Of course. Of course.
Will you pour, my lady?
I will be happy to.
Fine. This way, gentlemen.
More tea?
No, thank you.
No, thank you.
Who did that?
Who did it?
That's not tea, sir.
Oh, it isn't?
Jordan, get that bottle of cleaning fluid out of the truck.
Ok.
It's no use, sir.
Nothing will take it out.
What made that spot was blood.
Blood? Blood?
Blood.
Blood?
Quite so.
That's the blood of lady barbara modish,
Who stabbed herself in the throat
When she saw him.
Him?
Who-Who is him?
Sir simon. Our ghost.
Your ghost, did you say?
Yes. He's quite the most famous ghost in england,
And he lives here in this castle.
Wait a minute.
Take it easy.
Well, if you don't want me to tell you
Oh, but we do.
Give the lady a chance, fellas.
You know what it says in the little book about respecting english tradition.
Well, if she says the castle is haunted,
Who are we to quibble?
That's right.
It may sound silly to you,
But auntie told me the spot won't come out.
Really.
And i've even seen the ghost myself.
No fooling?
And that's the door to his bedchamber
Behind that tapestry,
Isn't it, Sra. Umney?
Yes. He was walled up in there centuries ago.
Holy catfish!
That's awful.
Yes, and every night now,
On the stroke of 12:00,
His guilty spirit comes through that door
And walks the halls, supposedly in search of a kinsman,
Then goes back again.
Oh. No kidding.
Oh, gentlemen, beware.
I've seen things with my own eyes
That would make any christian's hair
Stand on end.
I'll bet you have.
I've read all about it
In a big book auntie's got in the gatehouse.
I shouldn't tell you this before bedtime,
But the dowager duchess of stutfield
Was found one night
On the balcony outside her bedroom,
Stark staring mad.
There's the loveliest picture of her
Gibbering like an idiot.
You don't say!
Yes.
She was putting on her diamond lavaliere
When a shadow came over her.
She turned, and there was the ghost
As the corpse snatcher of chertsay barn.
Corpse snatcher?
That's awful.
And lady margaret bilton,
She drowned herself in the carp pond.
Do you know why?
No. Why?
Because there he was again,
Coming after her
With long, green fingers twitching with palsy
And his eyes burning like coals
The bloodsucker of bexley moor.
Bloodsucker?
Didn't i tell you, fellows?
Who are we to quibble?
What is your name, please?
Cuffy williams.
Well, cuffy williams,
I know very well that you've been laughing at me,
But just you wait.
Excuse me, my lady.
Far be it from me to contradict you,
But just you wait.
If it rained like this in california,
We wouldn't believe it.
Thanks, jordan.
May i, sergeant?
Oh, sure.
You don't have to rub too hard. It's wonderful stuff.
But, sir,
That spot used to be much observed by tourists,
And it belongs.
If this stuff will take out lipstick,
It ought to do this.
Well, lady jessica?
Get some water, smelling salts.
Somebody do something!
Well, cuffy williams?
Eddie.
Yeah?
You awake?
No.
Is it midnight yet?
I don't know.
Go to sleep, will you?
Hey! Hey! He's here!
He's here! He bit me!
He bit me! He bit me!
He bit me!
Who bit you? What bit you? Where?
It must have been that bloodsucker.
Oh, pipe down.
You must have been dreaming.
It must have been the bloodsucker!
Look at the teeth marks!
What am i, your mother?
You're the sergeant, ain't you?
Get up!
Hey, fellas, look. this sword fell down and scared him.
Well, bless his little heart.
Oh, it was. it was the sword.
Imagine that.
Did the big bad ghost frighten the little buttercup?
Yeah?
Aw, for pete's sake, turn it off, will you?
There are no such things as ghosts.
Well, something made that spot come back.
The cleaning fluid didn't take, that's all.
All i know. all right, kiddies,
Now, bunk in and go beddy bye-Bye.
One.
Two.
Sounds like somebody dragging ash cans around.
No. It's chains.
That ain't no ash can.
Hey, grandpa,
Your shirttail's hanging out.
Yeah, scram, dribble-Puss.
Go back in your hole!
Yeah, go on!
Get out of here!
Take warning!
Get out of here!
Duck, fellows!
Did-Did you all see what i saw?
The bullets went right through him.
What about that rope?
Yeah. You saw it, sarge.
Yeah.
I don't believe it, but i saw it.
Let's face it, sarge.
That was a real ghost.
What did i tell you?
How about that blood spot and the kid?
I told you so.
Didn't i, eddie?
Yeah, that's right.
You shouldn't have hollered at him like that.
That's no way to treat a ghost.
It chased him away, didn't it?
What if he comes back?
He might come back at that.
Hey, fellas, listen.
A ghost!
Away!
I i said away!
Oh! My toe!
He was looking for a kinsman,
And, boy, did he find one!
Sergeant, we won't be doing anything strenuous today, will we?
Doing it with phantoms yet!
I'm tireder than a sharecropper's mule.
Cut the grousing, fellas.
Here comes the looey.
Attention!
At ease.
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
We're now officially attached
To a unit of the british commandos.
So we're gonna celebrate by
Starting right out on our
10-Hour endurance hike.
Forced marching rate for eight hours.
Double time the last two.
What's the matter with the men, sergeant?
As a matter of fact, sir, i'm afraid
They didn't exactly sleep so well last night.
Really? Why not?
Well, maybe it was, uh. you know how it is
When you sleep in a new place.
Walters!
Is that what kept you up?
Oh, no, sir.
What kept me up was seeing the ghost.
Wasn't it, eddie?
That's right. i mean, yes, sir.
You, uh. all saw a ghost?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You should have been there, sir.
First he hung himself.
Then he came back and held his head out just like this.
By the hair!
Isn't that too, too dreadful?
Yes, sir.
Big, husky, man-Eating rangers.
Best platoon in the outfit.
What are you gonna do when you see nazis?
But nazis are tangible, sir.
I'll say they are. We can tangle with them, sir.
Suppose you tangle with me first.
Let's get it straight this time.
What kept you up last night,
A crap game?
No, sir! No!
It began with an ectoplasmic manifestation.
It began with a what?
An ectoplasmic manifestation.
Sergeant!
What really kept them up last night?
Well?
It was the ghost, sir.
All right, sergeant.
I guarantee the men will sleep tonight.
Form the platoon.
Yes, sir.
Fall in!
Dress right dress!
Straighten up there!
Ready front!
Sir, the platoon is formed.
Williams, i suppose you got that limp
From being chased by the ghost?
No, sir. I was chasing him.
But it's all right, sir. I can walk.
You can walk yourself right back into that castle
And spend the next 10 hours cleaning it out.
Yes, sir.
While you're about it, williams,
Clean out our little spook, too.
Yes, sir.
Right face!
Close march!
Hello there, lady.
Oh, it's you.
Well, who did you think it was?
Oh, i. no one.
I i was just going into the pantry.
Yeah? Then why did you take that great circle route?
Auntie thought the mess sergeant might like some onions.
And i'm a brownie.
We raise onions and brussels sprouts,
Like the girl guides do.
Oh, come now.
It was the ghost that scared you, wasn't it?
I. what if it were?
But that's silly.
The old boy called on us last night,
And we chased him right up the chimney.
Oh, you didn't.
You think i'm kidding, uh?
Well, we'll ask old foxy grandpa himself.
That-That won't be necessary.
You stay right here.
Playing possum.
Hey, grandpa, open up!
Well.
A calling we will go, my lady,
To beard the lion in his den.
Oh, no, please. Auntie's expecting me home.
You don't have to be afraid of him.
You only think you do.
Now you just pretend that you're not afraid,
And you won't be.
That's all there is to it.
Are you sure?
I'll prove it to you.
Come on.
Hey!
Ghost, where you hiding?
That must be where he was walled up.
Where the dark deed was done.
Here, hold this.
Hey, this one's loose.
I'll just pry it out, then we. hello.
Must you invade even my tomb?
Will there be no place i can call sanctuary?
Relax, grandpa.
This is just a little social call.
There's someone here i want you to meet.
I have already met your colonial ruffians.
Take it easy, grandpa.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Hey! Don't fade out on me.
I want you to meet lady jessica.
Sir simon the ghost.
Milady.
How do you do?
Not too well. Thank you.
Bless you.
Thank you.
Attagirl!
She's been scared stiff of you all her life.
I just wanted to prove to her
That you wouldn't hurt a flea.
Sir, my record speaks for itself
An unbroken reign of terror for 300 years.
Well, record or no record,
As long as her ladyship's around,
You've got to behave yourself.
It is absurd, asking me to behave myself,
Quite absurd.
I must rattle my chains and groan through keyholes.
I must gibber from the oriel window
On the first and third wednesdays in every month.
It is my solemn duty to walk these halls.
Well, in that case,
You'd better get yourself another castle for the duration, brother.
But cuffy, he can't.
He's the family ghost.
Americans, child.
What can a people without ancestors know about ghosts?
Now, wait a minute.
I take it you've never heard of the headless horseman
Or red grange, the galloping ghost.
Provincial stuff.
Spirits with neither crest nor title.
Oh, we have titles, too. prince mike romanoff,
Count basie, duke ellington.
You don't say so.
Nobility in a democracy. Balderdash.
But, Sr. Ghost. i mean, sir simon. we've had democracy here in england
Ever since the magna carta,
But i have never chosen to recognize it.
But you should, sir simon.
That's what we're fighting this war about,
My auntie says.
That's the stuff, my lady!
You see? You're not scared a bit.
Now that you two cantervilles are acquainted,
You must have a lot of family matters to gab about,
So, uh, i'll get on with my cleaning.
You, uh, sure you're all right?
Yes. Thank you.
Unless you'd rather be alone.
Oh, no, no.
Please, pray sit down.
I've forgotten my manners.
Well, if i may say so,
You could have been a little more polite to cuffy just now.
After what he and his band of hooligans did to me?
I may have very little else, but i still have my pride.
Maybe they wouldn't have done anything to you
If you hadn't frightened them.
What else is there for me to do?
I am a ghost. I must frighten people.
And i have a reputation to uphold.
The most fearsome phantom in all england cannot
But cuffy told me that they chased you up the chimney last night.
That was only because those hooligans had. lady jessica. i cannot pretend any longer.
Since last night,
It is i who am frightened,
I who tremble at the slightest noise.
Poor, poor ghost.
Do you know what it means to be a ghost,
Night after night, day after day,
To live in emptiness between heaven and earth
With nothing for company but your bitter memories?
But do you have to keep on being a ghost?
I am condemned to be a ghost
Until a kinsman perform a brave deed in my behalf.
I have walked these halls for three centuries,
And i'm so tired.
If only i could rest.
If only i could die.
To be buried in the soft, brown earth
In the garden beyond the pine woods,
To have no yesterday and no tomorrow,
To forget time,
To be at peace.
Oh, dear.
I wish i could do a brave deed for you.
How goes it, lady?
Oh, fine.
Sorry to bust up this little reunion,
But the looey will be back in a minute.
Good-Bye, sir simon.
I'm very happy to have met you.
Cuffy, i think you ought to tell your friends
Not to chase him up the chimney anymore.
Well, that depends on him.
But he's so old
And so tired.
Excuse me, my lady. See you later.
Sir simon, i just saw. cuffy has the canterville mark on his neck.
What?
Exactly like my father had.
That american ruffian?
Isn't it wonderful? He must be a canterville.
Egad, and what if he be a canterville?
Shall i prance joyously around
Like a saucy antelope?
But, sir simon,
If he is a kinsman, and if he does a brave deed in your name,
He can save you, can't he?
Can it be that they have concealed from thee
Why i am still here?
Dost fancy 'tis because i cannot find a kinsman?
Well, i heard Sr. Potts say
That the cantervilles always turned out to be cowards.
Is it that?
Cowards? Gross flattery.
Had they twice the courage,
'Twould only give them half the name.
Thy grandfather, would he mount a horse?
Thy father, so fearful of water
That he trembled in his bath. or thyself, swooning at the mere sight of my shadow.
Really, now!
It's your family, too, sir simon!
Only too well do i know.
But, sir simon, wait.
Cuffy can save you. I know it.
It isn't true that all cantervilles have to be cowards.
Haven't i lived long enough to know?
I was a coward, wasn't i?
I was frightened to death of you.
Now look at me. Look at me!
I'm not afraid of you anymore, not in the least.
Don't you see, sir simon?
Nay, nay. 'Twas in their blood and bones.
It isn't in my blood and bones,
And it isn't in cuffy's.
You can tell he's brave just by looking at him.
Oh, sir simon, i'll arrange for you to meet him again,
And if it turns out that he is a canterville. my goodness! Perhaps you'll be able to go to sleep
In the garden beyond the pine woods after all.
Please, sir simon.
Very well, child.
Sir simon, where are you?
Here, here.
Good evening, sir simon.
I brought him.
Sir?
How are you, sir simon? What's cooking?
Cooking?
Yeah. I mean, what's all the mystery?
The sergeant will have the bloodhounds after me
If i'm not in the hay by 9:00.
And auntie will be after me
If she finds out i'm not in bed.
Go on, sir simon, ask him.
Well, tell me, prithee. oh, yes.
I am aware that few americans know their own grandfathers,
But dost thou by any miracle
Remember aught of thine ancestors?
Ancestors? My old man would never look into his.
Said he was scared he might turn up one that ended up on the hot seat.
Hot seat? Nowadays, england and america have everything in common
Except, of course, the language.
Sir simon! Think back, cuffy, please.
Try to remember.
We don't go in much for that sort of thing
In the states.
Wait a minute. I had an aunt martha.
She was a little wacky on the subject.
Once, she did trace my mother's family tree back
As far as some guy that landed in massachusetts
Way, way back.
His name was, uh, marmalade.
No, no. Marmaduke.
Marmaduke. That same marmaduke who fled to salem
After cromwell scattered the chivalry of england to the four winds.
Oh, sir simon!
You knew him?
Yea. He was the son of my brother anthony.
Oh, now, take it easy, sir simon.
How do you know it's the same marmaduke?
Show him.
Holy cats!
Now thine, please.
Holy cats, indeed!
What did i tell you?
Well, i'll be. well, that makes me. your.
Nephew. Great-Great
Great-Great-Great-Nephew.
Aye, thou art a kinsman,
A kinsman who can free me
From these earthly bonds.
By performing a brave deed in his name.
I can, huh?
Wilt wear my signet, kinsman,
And carry it into battle in my behalf?
Well, i don't know, now.
See, uh. a colonial ruffian like me
Saving a blue blood like you?
Oh, but, cuffy, you must save him.
He's so tired and sleepy.
I couldn't eat my supper tonight from worrying over him.
Besides, thou art a canterville thyself,
The bluest blood in all broad england.
The bluest blood, huh?
Ok, it's a deal.
You're in, uncle,
The first time they turn me loose on those nazis.
I shall be everlastingly grateful, nephew.
I, too.
Well, it's about time to get you home, lady.
Thumbs up, uncle.
It's in the bag.
Oh, father,
Grant that he be not like the others.
The whole day wasted.
Right now we could be in london, buzzin' the town.
Yeah, or on skirt patrol, skirmishing.
What gets me is, the looey still thinks
We were up all night shooting crap.
If he'd only seen the ghost.
Don't worry, sarge.
Maybe he will yet.
That's right.
How?
Click, click.
You mean, take his picture?
If we had a camera, which we ain't got,
But which you got.
We got.
Hey, look out!
We got!
We got the camera for the ghost picture.
Listen, you guys, why don't you lay off that poor old ghost?
He isn't bothering us anymore, is he?
Not much! If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be stuck here.
You can't blame him. After all, a ghost has to groan
Through keyholes and rattle his chains.
Why the sudden sympathy?
Yeah. Who dreamed up the gas-Mask ideia?
Well, i know, but now i got a sort of a personal interest in him.
I have every reason to believe that i'm the long-Lost duke of canterville,
The bluest blood in all broad england.
The duke of canterville?
Seems to me i seen you in the induction center.
If i were you,
I'd be careful what i said and did, see?
Like what?
Like loafing on my lawn
And talking before you're talked to.
You can i beg your pardon, your grace.
This is your private lawn?
Yea.
Only you can lie on it?
Yea.
Excuse me, your grace.
Sorry!
Do you mind if we remove the coveralls?
Steady, old chap. It's an old english custom!
Depantsing the duke.
Hey, look!
Look!
Give me my pants!
Here, hide behind.
Good afternoon, everybody.
Good afternoon.
This is my aunt,
Sra. Polverdine.
Glad to meet you.
I don't know all your names, but you're bugsy, aren't you?
Yes, ma'am. How do you do?
And Sr. Walters.
He's the indian.
And.
And oh, auntie,
This is cuffy williams.
How do you do, private williams?
You've made quite an impression on my niece.
Thank you.
Cuffy i mean, all of you. auntie said i might invite you
To the party in the village this afternoon.
A party!
It's only a holiday-At-Home dance,
But there'll be refreshments.
Girls, too?
Oh, yes.
Girls, she says.
What are they?
Well. girls, girls, girls. oh, i remember.
Then you'll come?
Sure.
Oh, yeah.
Drive along, then, jessica.
I'm so glad to have met you.
4:00. Don't forget.
Thank you.
Bye.
Good-Bye!
Bye!
Bye!
Bye-Bye!
See you!
Good-Bye!
Bye!
Don't forget the girls!
Bye!
Well, wet your whistles.
Wet your whistles.
What do you do on moonlight nights, dimples?
Grind crankshafts for wellington bombers.
But it's daytime now.
Oh, well.
I say, could, uh. me?
Um, would you. sam, sam, ask him if he wants to dance.
Him?
Aye, him. Right.
Would you like to dance?
Why, i'd love to.
I bet he was a good dancer at one time.
Here's your dream man, cookie.
That's right.
My lady, may i have the pleasure of this dance?
With me? But i don't know how.
You don't? Then it's high time you learned.
Isn't it, Sra. Polverdine?
I think she's very fortunate
To have such a charming dancing teacher.
Thank you. My lady.
That's right.
I go forward, you go backward.
When i go backward, vice versa.
That-A girl.
I thought it would be more difficult.
It is for most people.
Swing it out, old-Timer. Come on.
Mind if i saw them catguts, mister?
My lady, looks like you're stuck with the bunion express.
I can't.
Come on. Climb aboard.
Is this indian style?
Hoboken tribe.
I believe they call it woogie-Boogie.
How does it feel to be the belle of the ball?
I like it very much,
But does it always make you so dizzy?
It makes most of them even dizzier.
Suppose you and i have a short one, hmm?
Two, uh, neat.
Yes, sir.
Anyhow, would you believe it?
The lieutenant thinks it's applesauce.
I believe you saw the canterville ghost right enough,
But the day will never dawn
When he'd run away from a human being, that it won't.
Wait a minute. Here's the guy to believe.
Boys, meet the duke of canterville himself.
Oh, the duke of canterville.
Honored, your grace.
If it can be called an honor to meet a canterville.
What's wrong with being a canterville?
Well, since you're so well-Acquainted with the ghost, why not ask him?
Cuffy, please,
Will you dance with me again?
Sure.
Hey, you!
It's me. Cuffy.
Odd's gallows, what a fright thou gavest me.
Uncle, i've been thinking.
Look, you can come into focus now. It's only me.
Oh, excuse me.
Thanks. That's better.
It's such a problem to have to walk these nights.
Uncle, if you're supposed to hang around here
Until a canterville does a brave deed for you,
How come you're still here after 300 years?
Has it really been that long?
What happened when they tried to save you?
Excuse me. I'm overdue now. I really must gibber at the oriel window.
Wait a minute.
Quit stalling.
What's wrong with the cantervilles?
Wrong? Sir, are you impugning the family honor?
All right. I was willing to play along with you,
But if you're going to hold out on me. nay, nay, kinsman.
I was merely trying to spare thee.
Spare me?
What? Go on. Spill it.
Mayhap it is better
If thine ancestors speak for themselves.
Come with me.
Hey, eddie. He's out there.
Harry. Harry. The ghost is walking.
Come on.
In here, nephew.
Oh, excuse me. I keep forgetting.
It's ok. Just a little new to me.
This must be a room i missed sweeping out the other day.
Would thou couldst sweep away its history.
Gaze upon them, our noble family.
Sir gerald de canterville,
The proud skipper of the frigate cranston.
When she sank,
He was the first to leave his ship.
Sir andrew de canterville.
He saw a grenadier lose a finger at blenheim battle
And swooned away.
And the blessed twins.
Lieutenant paul rode the wrong way
In the charge of the light brigade.
Lieutenant peter was
10 lengths ahead of him.
You mean they were all cowards.
All.
At the moment of crisis, their eyes distend,
Their knees buckle,
Their hands tremble as with the ague.
Aye, of all the heroic families
That for centuries have brightened
The honor and glory of england,
Ours had to be a brood of lily-Livered titmice.
So that's why you held out on me.
You thought if i found out, i'd be the same way.
Oh, nay, not at all. It never entered my mind.
Then what are you making all the fuss about?
So they all turned chicken on you.
So they all have carrots for breakfast on tuesdays.
It's the same thing to me.
Verily?
I don't care what the others did.
This is cuffy, see?
Verily.
All right, then.
Now, harry, shoot!
We got it! Yippee!
What's going on?
The ghost's picture.
He got it. Who?
Harry! He's in the armor.
That-A boy, harry.
Harry, you got it.
Take it easy, harry.
Take it easy, now.
Careful. Careful!
Gee, i broke it, didn't i, eddie?
That's right.
All right, men, this is it.
Start loading the trucks.
Battle equipment!
Check the men for personal belongings.
Walker-Dynamite, plunger boxes, fuse, wire.
Brown! Be sure to take off that ring. It'll shine in the dark.
Sure thing, sarge.
Remember, we blow the refinery at 2350.
We have to hold this point the eight minutes it takes us to get back
In case any jerries come down this road from the coast and try to cut us off.
Check? Check.
Check.
Mcdougle, you'll find the phone wire about a half-Mile down the road.
Cut it and get back to your crew. Yes, sir.
Protection plus the widest range of fire.
You all set?
Yep.
It won't be long now, gwendolyn.
I think i'll keep an eye out from above.
Ok, cuffy. but deliver us from evil,
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory
Forever and ever.
Amen.
I have so much special to ask tonight.
Please take care of cuffy.
Please do. Don't let him get hurt.
And uncle simon. you know, i told you about him. he's such a poor, poor, funny old ghost,
And he's so tired.
Won't you please let cuffy save him
So he can go to sleep?
Ye skulking, cringing, misbegotten package of peafowl,
Ye wretched poltroons
Who have darkened england's brightest moments,
Not for long now will i have you leering at me
In cynical mockery,
Not for long. ye dribble-Pusses.
As for thee, captain bertram,
Who hid trembling in a well at waterloo,
I spit in thine eye.
Thee, fat algernon,
Who posed for two years as a dowager
To escape fighting a duel,
I spit in thine eye.
Thee, sir percival,
Who fought through the thirty years' war
Without firing a shot. the ring!
Did you see it?
The ring. You forgot the ring.
Well, give it here.
Thank you.
Forget it.
Well?
Thinkest thou the enemy will come this way?
That isn't what's worrying you.
With half an eye, one can see that thou hast the heart of a lion.
Horsefeathers. Go away, will you? Go on!
I merely thought i could bolster you up
In case you were a bit squeamish.
I want to be squeamish!
Quit checking up on me and scram, will you?
As you will.
I thought i told you to beat it.
Thou art my only hope, my only salvation.
Sign off, will you?!
What's happened to those guys?
Trigger!
Keep a cool head. Keep a cool head. Keep a cool head.
Get out of here!
Go on, get out!
Motorcycle patrol.
Lots of them.
We'll wait till we see the backs of their tonsils.
God, there's hope.
Trigger.
Trigger!
Get 'em, cuffy.
Fire, nephew, fire!
Fire, nephew, fire!
Nephew! Nephew!
Nephew.
Oh, ice cream and cookies
For flat-Footed rookies
So cheer up, my lads, bless them all
Bless them all, bless them all
The long and the short and the tall
Bless all the blondies and all the brunettes
Each lad is happy to take what he gets
'Cause we're giving the eye to them all
The ones that attract or appall
Maud, maggie, or susie, you can't be too choosy
When you're in camp, bless them all
The colonel's compliments, and he wants me to tell you
That we are the best platoon in the whole outfit.
Hooray! Hooray!Hooray!
But i'm not satisfied,
So we're gonna take a little jaunt into the woods
And iron out the mistakes we made on our raid.
Right now.
Right now!
Fall in!
Williams.
I've discussed your report with the colonel, and he feels
We have no alternative but to transfer you back to your old outfit.
Rules are rules, williams, and we can't afford to risk your life
And the lives of others taking another chance.
Yes, sir.
I've arranged for a jeep to pick you up at 2200.
Thank you, sir.
Good luck, williams.
Sir, the platoon is formed.
Left face!
Right shoulder
- Arms!
Forward march!
Gertie from bizerte
You're as purty, purty, purty as can be
Gertie from bizerte
Don't you never, ever dare desertie me
Though your lingo i don't know
When we kiss, you make me holler "bingo!"
Gertie from bizerte
You're the gal for me
Cuffy, i've been expecting you for days,
And auntie put me to bed early,
And i couldn't sleep all last night, and. cuffy, what happened?
You better run along home, lady. I got to pack.
You're going away?
Yeah.
Oh, cuffy.
That's right. Look at me.
I'm a canterville, all right,
Just as cowardly as the rest of them.
Don't say that.
You're not a coward.
You're brave. I know it.
I know it.
All right, lady, have it your own way.
Cuffy.
I'm sorry it turned out this way.
Good-Bye, lady.
Cuffy. cuffy! Cuffy!
There's a parachute. I just saw it coming down.
Maybe a nazi came down in it.
Oh, cuffy, what will we do?
Where is that parachute, lady?
It's this side of the stone bridge.
Where's the stone bridge?
Do you know the old side road? No.
I'll take you. I know a shortcut.
All right. Come on.
We'll go in the jeep.
There.
You stay here. Duck down.
Duck down!
Parachute mine!
A blockbuster!
Let's go, lady!
That thing goes off, it'll kill every living thing within a half a mile!
The slightest jar might start it ticking.
Look! The rangers.
They're scattered all through the woods.
They'll be killed.
Jessica, get back to the castle quick!
But aren't you coming?
I got to haul it away with the jeep, dump it over the cliff.
Get going now. Run quick! Hide in the cellar!
Run!
Lady jessica!
Oh, uncle simon!
Where's cuffy? Has he encountered the enemy?
Oh, uncle simon, cuffy's moving a blockbuster.
He's doing the bravest deed that ever was.
The portrait of a canterville.
No, uncle, no!
You're not a coward!
You're not a coward!
Cuffy, you were doing the brave deed.
Don't you see?
You can do it!
You don't have to be afraid because you're a canterville.
You only think you do.
Look, cuffy, i'm not afraid of the mine!
Look, cuffy, look!
I'm not afraid of the mine! Look, cuffy, look!
I'm not afraid of anything because, because. it's ticking!
Jessica!
Run for it, lady!
I'm all right now.
Go get out of here.
I'm all right, i tell you! Run!
Out of my way!
Careful, nephew.
Careful.
Get in, uncle.
Keep your eye on that tow chain.
Hey, you rangers, run for your lives!
We got a blockbuster on here,
A time bomb!
Run! Blockbuster!
Hey, uncle, where are you?
Here!
Nephew!
Nephew!
If it'll only hold for 20 seconds more! run, uncle, run!
Run, nephew! what's all this hooey about ticking?
It's a dud.
How will we ever get it into place again?
Oh, my.
My bowler.
Never mind your bowler.
Go and ring up the air raid service.
Oh, dear.
Well, i suppose we're lucky to have escaped with our lives.
Jessica.
I made him do it. Cuffy.
Now, darling, we'll go home,
And i'll put you in your nice warm bed.
I'll get your things.
Gertie from bizerte
You're the gal for me
Gertie from bizerte
Cuffy! as can be
Gertie from bizerte
Don't you never, ever dare desertie me
Desertie me
Though your lingo i don't know
When we kiss, you make me holler "bingo!"
Gertie from bizerte
You're the gal for me
Cuffy, you're alive.
How did you do it?
I just dumped the cockeyed thing right into the ravine.
Like saint george slaying the cockeyed dragon.
Uncle simon.
What, child?
If cuffy is a canterville,
And he's done a brave deed for you,
Then why are you standing here?
Yeah. Why aren't you in that garden beyond the pine woods?
Father.
Father!
Poor uncle simon.
Father!
Father.
Thank you, nephew.
Thank you, niece.
Farewell.
Farewell, uncle.
Farewell.
Did you see that, lieutenant?
That's what we've been trying to. gee, that certainly is a long time to go without sleep.
Yes, but you nearly always have to wait
For anything you want very much.
How old are you, cuffy?
Why?
I shall be 7 in may.
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
Written and Directed by
JEAN COCTEAU
From a Story by
MADAME LEPRINCE DE BEAUMONT
- Action.
- Rolling.
Beauty and the Beast, take one.
Cut. Just a minute.
Children believe what we tell them.
They have complete faith in us.
They believe that a rose plucked from a garden can plunge a family into conflict.
They believe that the hands of a human beast will smoke when he slays a victim, and that this will cause the beast shame when a young maiden takes up residence in his home.
They believe a thousand other simple things.
I ask of you a little of this childlike simplicity, and, to bring us luck, let me speak four truly magic words, childhood's 'Open Sesame':
"Once upon a time..."
That girl!
You know how she is.
She can't do a thing.
No good!
Cheater!
Your foot's not on the line.
My dress!
- What's the matter?
- They shot an arrow into the room.
You brutes!
You could have blinded us!
- Is Belle all right?
- Always Belle.
The hell with her!
You nearly killed Cabriole.
There they are.
Belle, scrub the floor.
We're going to be late for the duchess.
Murderers!
- My sisters are shrews.
Drinking, chasing girls and cheating at cards -- it's all they care about.
When you're poor, you stay home and wash clothes and polish the cutlery.
These witches act like princesses and never even realize everyone's laughing in their face.
- Answer him.
- I won't give him the satisfaction.
What beautiful creatures!
Let's hurry or we'll miss the concert.
So enchanting! So divine!
Simpletons!
Footmen!
Incredible!
Do we pay you to sleep?
I've never seen anything like it!
These chairs!
These chairs are filthy!
Footmen!
Hurry up!
Come on, we're leaving!
Not under the ladder!
Drunkards, you're asleep on your feet!
That drunkard doesn't even know his place.
Good-for-nothing!
They've been drinking!
Come on, footmen!
May the devil himself splatter you with dung.
Belle, you weren't made to be a servant.
Even the floor longs to be your mirror!
You mustn't go on slaving day and night for your sisters.
If our father's ships hadn't been lost in the storm, then perhaps I could enjoy myself like them.
But we're ruined, Avenant, and I must work.
Why don't your sisters work?
My sisters are too beautiful.
Their hands are too white.
Belle, you are the most beautiful of all!
Look at your hands.
Avenant, let go of my hand.
Please go.
I must finish my work.
I love you.
Marry me.
No, Avenant.
You mustn't speak of that again.
It's no use.
You don't like me.
It's not that, Avenant.
Well, then?
I must remain a maid and stay with Father.
I'll carry you away from this stupid life!
Let me go!
Get your hands off her!
You want a black eye?
It's all right, Ludovic.
He was asking me to marry him.
- What did you say?
- Your sister doesn't want me.
I'm a scoundrel, and proud of it, but I won't stand to see you marry one.
Consider yourself warned.
Now clear out, you hoodlum!
Avenant, you're mad!
Come in, gentlemen.
Make yourselves at home while I tell everyone the great news.
My father!
He mustn't know.
My daughters are out being pampered by high society.
But I can't wait for them.
I'm itching to break the news.
Come here, Belle.
Come, Ludovic.
You're welcome too, Avenant.
These gentlemen will overlook your mischief, just as the prosecutor here has done me the great favor of suspending all proceedings begun against me.
We're going to be rich!
One of my ships has arrived with its cargo.
- Avenant knew it!
- Ludovic!
That's why he asked
Belle to marry him.
He asked me before while we were still poor.
- Are you going to leave me?
- No, Father, I'll never leave you.
They said the duchess wasn't receiving guests, but we could hear laughter and music in the court.
Congratulations, Father! We've just reaped the fruits of your foolishness.
You should be proud!
Invite one and all to drink while your daughters are insulted and doors slam in their face!
- My darlings!
- That duchess is a smart woman.
I'm so ashamed I could die!
Come, Adelaide.
Leave them to drink to our ill fortune.
Father!
Let those two devils sulk.
I'll soon make it up to them.
I'll set out for port tomorrow and settle my affairs.
They'll be married to a duke and a prince!
Gentlemen!
Bring us back some brocade dresses.
Jewels, fans and ostrich feathers!
I want the whole town to die of envy!
A monkey!
I'd like a monkey.
A parrot.
What shall I bring back for you, Belle?
Father, bring me a rose.
There aren't any around here.
If I don't pay up tonight, they'll throw me in prison.
A moneylender is quick to understand.
I told him the whole story.
Lay it on thick.
Here he comes.
It's a very large sum.
You know one of the lost ships has made it back to port.
I'll pay you as soon as my father returns.
You know the law: If you can't pay,
I can sue your father for it.
If your father can't pay,
I'll take his furnishings.
Sign it.
What can you lose?
What can I do, sir?
If nothing's left from the last ship, what's to become of me?
Your creditors in the port were quicker than those in town. Sue them.
I don't even have money to stay at the inn in town.
Then return home.
Cross the forest in the dark of night?
I'll get lost.
You crossed it at night to get here.
But there was a moon out then.
Now there's a fog.
I tell you, I'll get lost.
- Get lost, then!
Easy for you to say!
I'd like to see you in my shoes.
It's frightening!
Is anybody there?
Is anyone there?
Anybody there?
Hello?
So, my dear sir, you steal my roses.
You steal my roses, the things I love most in all the world.
Your luck has gone from bad to worse.
You could have taken anything -- except my roses.
The punishment for this simple theft is death!
Sir, I didn't know.
I meant no harm.
My daughter asked me to bring her a rose.
Don't address me as "sir."
I'm called the Beast!
I don't like compliments.
Don't try to understand.
You have 1 5 minutes to prepare to die.
- Sir --
- Again!
The Beast orders you to be silent.
You stole a rose, so you must die.
Unless one of your daughters --
How many do you have?
- Three.
Unless one of your daughters agrees to pay your debt and take your place.
Don't argue. Be off!
Make the most of the chance
I've offered you.
And should your daughters refuse to die in your place, swear to return in three days.
Swear it!
I swear.
But how will I find my way home?
I got lost in the forest.
You'll find a white horse in my stables.
His name is Magnificent.
Whisper in his ear,
"Go where I am going, Magnificent.
Go, go, go!"
He'll take you home and bring you back to my castle, should your daughters prove too cowardly to ride him in your place.
Go now!
I don't remember if the journey was quick or endless.
Magnificent is in our stable.
That's my story.
Take this rose, Belle.
It has cost me dear.
That's what happens when a fool asks you to bring her a rose.
See what her pride has caused!
She tried to teach us a lesson by acting the picture of modesty!
She's not even crying!
You won't die, Father.
It's my fault.
It's only right that I go in your place.
- Are you crazy?
Ludovic and I will go and kill this awful beast!
His power is too great.
You could never destroy him.
Don't you worry, Belle.
I am old, and I gave my word.
I will go.
You will not go, Father.
You can still win your case.
- How will we get by?
- Sell my furniture.
Why don't you go, Felicity?
You're too tough to eat!
Too bad the Beast doesn't want a boy.
He could eat you and die of poisoning!
Children, please.
Father, I'd rather be eaten alive by that monster than die of grief at your loss.
- You will not go to that monster!
- What business is it of yours?
It's mine if I say it is!
Do you love the little fool?
You make a fine pair!
- Avenant, slap her!
- Calm down.
Repeat what you just said.
A pair of fools!
He struck me!
- Brute! Scoundrel!
- You dare slap my sister?
- You want one too? I've got plenty!
Cheat! Thief!
My children!
- Ludovic, he's ill.
- Let's take him to his room.
- He struck me, Adelaide!
- We don't have a penny left.
We mustn't lose our heads.
The Beast will devour them all, and we'll marry princes!
Go where I am going,
Magnificent.
Go, go, go!
Belle, I am the door to your room.
I am your mirror, Belle.
Reflect in your heart for me, and I will reflect for you.
Where are you going?
Belle, you mustn't look into my eyes.
You needn't fear.
You will never see me, except each evening at 7:00, when you will dine, and I will come to the great hall.
And never look into my eyes.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not.
Will you permit me to watch you dine?
You are the master.
There is no master here but you.
I disgust you.
You find me repulsive.
I cannot lie, Beast.
Everything here is at your command.
I don't feel at ease in all this finery, and I'm not used to being waited on.
But I sense you are doing everything possible to help me forget your ugliness.
I have a good heart, but I am a monster.
There are men far more monstrous than you, though they conceal it well.
Besides being hideous,
I'm not quick-witted.
You're quick enough to recognize it.
Everything in this castle is yours.
Make your slightest whim known.
I shall appear every evening at 7:00.
Then, before taking my leave,
I will ask you one question.
Always the same question.
What is that question?
Will you be my wife?
No, Beast!
Good-bye, then, Belle.
Until tomorrow.
Where is Belle?
- Why are you in my room?
- I wanted -- I was just --
I came to bring you a gift.
Get out!
Get out.
I thought you'd be having supper, Belle.
I'm not hungry.
I'd rather walk with you.
You do me a great honor.
A great honor.
Your voice seems softer.
Are your days here terribly boring?
I do find the days long.
I confess, this evening
I was looking forward to 7:00.
Your kindness encourages me to ask once again the question that torments my soul.
Go ahead and ask.
My answer will always be the same.
Let us be friends, Beast.
Don't ask me for more.
And what do you do all day?
Are you listening to me?
I'm talking to you.
Forgive me.
Where are you, Beast?
Forgive me.
It's nothing.
What's the matter?
I'm thirsty.
Drink from my hands.
It doesn't repulse you to let me drink from your hands?
No, Beast. I like it.
I'd never want to cause you the slightest harm.
But still you dream of being far away from me.
You're very late.
Thank you for noticing, Belle.
I confess I was very impatient to see you.
I must speak with you!
- Belle!
I can't live without seeing my father.
Please, let me go.
- Get up, Belle!
It is I who should kneel and take orders from you.
Let me go and come back.
When you return, will you be my wife?
You're killing me.
I know I'm horrible to look at.
But I would die of grief if I let you go and you didn't return.
I'll return in a week.
I care for you too much to want to cause your death.
You stroke me the way one strokes an animal.
But you are an animal.
What you ask is a very serious matter.
I must think about it.
Will you walk with me to the garden?
Has another asked for your hand in marriage?
Yes, Beast.
Who proposed to you?
A young man?
Yes, Beast.
Was he handsome?
Yes.
Why didn't you marry him?
I couldn't leave my father.
What was this handsome young man's name?
Avenant.
What's the matter?
Beast, what's wrong?
What are you doing at my door at this hour?
Heavens!
You're covered with blood!
- Forgive me.
- What should I forgive you for?
For being a beast.
Forgive me.
Those words are not worthy of you.
Aren't you ashamed?
Clean yourself up and go to bed.
Close your door!
Quickly!
Close your door!
Your look burns like fire.
I cannot bear you to look at me like that.
They're taking everything.
You'll see -- they'll take our table, too.
Let's play.
Go speak with your father.
He doesn't understand, of course.
It's not my place to tell him the truth.
Go on.
Ludovic, confess it was you.
To tell the truth, yes, it was.
Ludovic, this is your doing.
The gentlemen's very ill.
You must leave him his bed.
We always leave the beds.
I bet you those women find a way to keep their things.
I have a guarantee for your sisters.
Give me a hand.
Are you ill?
Yes, Beast, I am.
What is it?
My father is dying.
I can't bear to see you ill.
Send me home to my father.
If I accept, do you swear to return in a week?
I swear.
Come.
Look over there, Belle.
Do you see that pavilion?
It's called Diana's Pavilion.
It's the only place in my domain where no one may enter.
Not you and not I.
AlI I possess,
I possess by the power of magic.
But my true riches are in that pavilion, and one can only enter with a golden key.
Here it is, Belle.
I give you the greatest possible proof of trust that one can give in this world.
If you do not return,
I will die.
After my death, you will be safely out of danger, and my riches will be yours.
Take the key.
I know your soul.
This key, delivered into your hands, will be the pledge of your return.
Then you agree to send me back to my father?
You'll be there this very morning.
Night is not the same here as where you come from.
Here, it's night.
In your world, it's day.
A rose with its role to play, my mirror, my golden key, my horse and my glove are the five secrets of my power.
I entrust them to you.
You have only to put this glove on your right hand and you'll be transported wherever you wish.
Remember your promise.
Farewell, Belle.
- I'm dreaming.
- No, Father, you're not.
It's really me -- Belle.
Thinking you were dead,
I myself was dying.
Did you escape?
- No, the Beast let me come see you.
- Then that monster has a soul?
- He suffers.
One half of him is in constant struggle with the other half.
He's more cruel to himself than he is to human beings.
Belle, I saw him.
That face is hideous.
At first I was indeed afraid, Father.
Now I sometimes feel like bursting out laughing.
But then I look into his eyes, and they're so sad that I have to turn away to keep from crying.
Don't tell me you've agreed to live with that monster!
I must, Father.
Certain powers obey him, while there are others he must obey.
If I ran away, I'd cause great harm to him -- and to you.
Does he threaten you?
He comes to me only at times when his cruelty is not too frightening.
Sometimes his bearing is almost noble.
Other times, he's unsteady and seems stricken with some infirmity.
You manage to feel sorry for him?
I bear his presence, because I'd be happy if I could make him forget his ugliness.
Your goodness will cost you dearly, my Belle.
Father, that monster is good.
My heavens!
A diamond!
And another.
Proof that the spirits are keeping him safe because I cried for him.
These diamonds could be the devil's work.
Put your mind at ease, Father.
They are yours to keep.
He's given them to you.
They'll bring you life.
But if you tell my sisters, they'll take the diamonds and leave you with nothing.
I'd rather sleep in sheets than hang them up.
Look at my hands!
Appalling!
Look at mine!
Reduced to being a cook!
My dear princesses, when you're poor, you work!
- Imbecile!
-You should talk, you swindler!
If it weren't for you, we'd still have a servant.
It was my fault.
Kindly take note that
I am paying for it in the flesh.
When you're not drinking or gambling.
Such charming creatures!
How is your father this morning?
You think they take care of him?
I'm the one looking after him.
He's still very weak and cannot stand.
Felicity, Adelaide, Ludovic!
For heaven's sake!
An elegant woman, and Father standing at her side!
And us without our finery!
It's Belle!
- Belle? Impossible.
- But it is.
Go away!
As charming as ever.
Belle came to my room and restored me to health.
Where did you come from?
What a magnificent necklace!
You take it, Felicity.
It will look even more magnificent on you.
- My God!
- Drop it this instant!
The Beast meant it for you alone.
You can't give it to anyone else.
Come, Adelaide, let's get dressed.
What must we look like?
Good-bye, my lovelies!
Who did my washing?
We did.
The sheets are dragging on the ground.
So, he's not a ferocious beast?
No, he's a good beast.
You're not going back, are you?
Yes, Avenant. I promised.
The Beast freed me for just one week.
If I don't return, he'll die of grief.
Do you love him?
No, Avenant.
I'm fond of him.
It's not the same thing.
The Church Tribunal will be quite interested in the display of witchcraft we just witnessed.
Good-bye for now.
Let's go in the shed.
We can have a serious talk now.
They won't hear us.
So tell us.
He's entrusted me with the key to his treasure.
He has complete confidence in me.
I'd be the monster if I were to not return.
How many servants wait on you?
Invisible hands serve me.
They dress me and arrange my hair.
They open and close the doors.
I never see a soul.
Does this Beast speak the language of men?
Yes. He speaks like you and me.
Does he crawI on four legs?
What does he eat and drink?
I've given him water to drink on occasion.
He would never eat me.
- Can you imagine?
- Incredible.
That little fool is happier than we are. She's rich!
There are a lot of other husbands with beards and horns.
- She's so proud she could burst.
- Don't worry.
I've got a good head on these shoulders.
We'll be very friendly and let the boys worm the information out of her.
How much do you have on you?
There. It's frightening.
We must act.
I've come to a decision.
There's nothing more we can do.
I can't stand the idea of Belle returning to that beast tomorrow.
We must kill him.
And take his treasure.
But do you realize we're dealing with magic powers?
I don't believe in magic powers.
The Beast hypnotizes her to see what he wants her to.
I'm scared.
No power in the world can frighten me when it comes to rescuing Belle.
Besides, we have no choice.
Convince your sisters there's something in it for them.
They'll stop Belle from leaving.
Dazzle them with the treasure.
How will you ever find the Beast's castle?
I'll ask Belle.
I'll pry the secret out of her.
We'll rub our eyes with onions to make us cry.
She'll smell it.
Ludovic's ideas are always so distasteful!
The little fool's too stupid to notice.
Ludovic's idea isn't so dumb.
Help me.
Delightful.
Hurry up!
Belle, you mustn't leave us.
You can't go.
Stay here with us.
We haven't always been fair to you, but now that we might lose you, we realize how much we love you.
Are you crying?
If the Beast really loves you, he'll let you stay longer.
- Stay another week.
- Impossible.
Do you want your father and sisters to die of grief?
Stay with us, Belle.
- I can't.
- Don't be like that. Stay!
Adelaide, my little sister.
Adelaide was just saying,
"Now I see who our Belle really is.
I'll die if she leaves us."
- Don't tempt me.
- Don't leave us tomorrow.
Explain to the Beast it's your sisters' fault.
I didn't know you loved me so much.
You're an angel!
We're so happy.
We're so very, very happy!
She's crying.
She'll stay, and we'll share the treasure.
Let's go and wash.
You stink!
- Well?
- Well, what?
- Is she staying?
- Yes.
- Do you have the key?
- Give it here.
- What do you take me for?
- We know what you'll do. It's gold!
- You idiot!
- Don't start again.
I'll give it to Avenant if he decides to go.
You women are too much!
Where's he going to go, and how?
We'll let him figure that out!
Belle, you seem sad.
No, Father.
She misses her luxuries.
Our banality disgusts her.
Felicity!
The Beast undoubtedly possesses charms that we lack.
Mademoiselle must think she's too grand to wait on us now.
What have they done to you now?
It was your sisters.
They don't waste any time, the wretches!
Belle, listen to me.
Don't cry.
I must wake you from this nightmare.
I have to take you away.
I know what you're thinking, that I'm just a scoundrel.
But at your side I will work!
We'll leave this town and these taverns.
Answer me.
What is it?
I see -- it's the Beast.
Tell me how to reach his castle, and I'll go and kill him.
You don't answer.
I knew it.
He's worked some charm on you.
Or else that heart of yours that I know so well cannot bring itself to wish him evil.
Belle, I assure you, if that monster suffered as I do, he would rush to your side and carry you off with him.
I assure you, he's forgotten you.
Come in, quick.
They won't find us here.
You're late, as usual.
Well?
My mind's made up.
There's no going back.
That's fine, but how will we get to the Beast's castle?
Didn't you find out her secret?
She only says what the Beast allows her to.
We know all the other details, but she wouldn't tell us that.
I'll get it out of her.
I'll torture her!
Do that and you can count me out.
What's that?
I'll go and see.
A lone white horse.
It's Magnificent.
I'm sure of it!
He jumped the fence and entered the courtyard.
Heaven sent him to us.
- Hell, more likely.
- I'm afraid.
Shut up, idiot!
Bring the horse in, quietly.
Don't anyone go out there.
I'm going.
The Beast sent him here to get Belle.
Perfect timing!
The horse will take you and Ludovic instead.
- It's all right for you to talk!
- Are you a man or a woman?
- I'd like to see you go.
- We've no time to lose.
Get on behind me, Ludovic.
- God save us!
Your bows!
What's that in my way?
A sack.
If it's gold, it'll change to straw if I touch it. You open it.
A mirror!
To reflect the ugly heart of a girl who breaks her promises.
See? The Beast isn't so stupid after all.
Here's the key.
Off you go, and good luck.
- I forgot the magic words.
- It's something like "go, go, go."
We'd be in fine shape if we had to count on you.
"Go where I am going, Magnificent.
Go, go, go."
Ludovic!
What's wrong with you?
Have we sent them to their deaths?
Fool!
The mirror!
I have an uneasy feeling.
Look at yourself.
You're green!
Look!
What do you see?
- Nothing.
Let's take it to Belle.
It's her turn.
Mademoiselle dresses up like a princess when she thinks she's all alone, eh?
Who do you think you are?
This mirror was mysteriously left for you on the doorstep.
You'll see what kind of beauty pleases a Beast!
The key!
Where is it?
My Beast!
Answer me, Beast!
Forgive me.
Answer me, Beast.
Look at me.
Your glove will revive you.
Help me.
I am the monster.
You will live.
- Too late.
- Are we there?
- Yes.
First we have to kill the Beast.
- We'll take care of that later.
Do you have the key?
Stop.
That golden key could set off some diabolical device.
We have to be careful.
- Right.
We won't use the door.
Follow me.
Climb up.
Be brave!
You're scared, as usual.
I'm not scared.
I'm just thinking.
Same thing.
Are you coming?
- Where are we?
- On some kind of glass panels.
Look!
Amazing!
What's that?
It's Diana.
Don't be a coward!
Use those powerful claws to hold on to life!
Fight! Get up and let out a roar!
Scare death away!
Belle, if I were a man... perhaps I could do as you say.
But poor beasts who wish to prove their love can only grovel on the ground and die.
- I'll break the glass.
- Be careful.
Glass is just glass.
Hold on to my hands.
I'll lower myself down and jump to the ground.
- It's too high.
- I'll jump.
- How do we get the treasure out?
- Don't worry. First we have to get in.
Stand firm and get a good grip.
Wait a minute.
Don't let go yet.
Don't let go until I tell you.
Where is the Beast?
He is no more.
It was I, Belle.
My parents didn't believe in magic spirits, so the spirits took their revenge through me.
I could only be saved by a loving look.
Can such miracles really happen?
You and I are living proof.
Love can turn a man into a beast.
But love can also make an ugly man handsome.
What's wrong, Belle?
It's almost as if you miss my ugliness.
It's not that, my lord.
But you look like someone
I used to know.
Who?
My brother's friend.
Did you love him?
Yes.
Did he know?
But you did love the Beast?
Yes.
You're a strange girl, Belle.
A strange girl.
At your service.
Are you disappointed that I look like your brother's friend?
Yes.
The first time
I took you in my arms,
I was the Beast.
Are you happy?
I'll have to get used to it.
Where will you take me?
To my kingdom, where you'll be a great queen.
There you'll be reunited with your father, and your sisters will carry the train of your gown.
Is it far?
We'll fly through the air.
You won't be frightened?
I don't mind being frightened... with you.
I'm taking you away.
Off we go.
THE END
- Oh. This is very kind of you.
- lt's a privilege.
- Which way are you going?
- Over there. The Mutual Building.
- My doctor is in there. l have hopes.
- Fine.
- l'm all right now.
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas to you.
- Merry Christmas.
Mother, please lift me up! Please.
All right then. Just for a minute.
Look at that doll.
Look at the funny choo-choo train.
Come on now, darling. We have to go.
Oh, my baby! Oh, my baby!
Oh, my baby. Oh, you saved her.
Oh, thank God you saved my baby.
How can l ever thank you?
- Don't try. Just don't let it happen again.
- l promise l won't.
- Remember that. Now on your way.
- Yes. lt closely resembles its noble cousin - the California red fir. lt's botanically dissimilar.
Pay me heed, Maggenti.
This is a specimen of the white fir -
Abies concolor.
Surely you, a native Roman, know your Latin?
You wanna buy or not?
- Well, if it isn't my dear, beautiful Julia.
- Hello, Professor.
- What are you doing in this part of town?
- Buying a Christmas tree.
- Hello, Mr Maggenti.
- Mrs Brougham.
How much do you charge for this miserable weed?
- $1 .85! For this half-hearted twig? l shall pay you ten cents a branch or take my trade elsewhere.
- What can l do for you, Mrs Brougham?
- You can save me that tree.
- The big one right by the door.
- OK.
Every Christmas for the past 18 years,
Maggenti and l have been re-enacting the same argument. l didn't know you celebrated Christmas. l thought you had no religion.
That's true, my dear, but l like to have a Christmas tree because it reminds me of my childhood. l feel, for some reason, that this is a good time of year for looking backwards.
Can you imagine me ever having been a child?
How's Henry? l haven't seen him for some time.
Oh, he's well, thank you.
He's terribly tired and worried. ls he having difficulty raising money for the cathedral?
Yes. lt's slow work.
- How's your book coming?
- Oh, splendidly.
Greatest history of Rome since Gibbon.
But, of course, nobody will read it.
Now, my good man, l do not choose to prolong this tawdry bickering any further.
All right. Ten cents a branch.
- lt's $1 .40.
- Very well, my venal friend.
Here is your blood money.
Mr Maggenti, will you send the tree up on Christmas Eve?
- But l don't want my daughter to see it.
- Don't worry. l send it when the bambino goes to bed.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas! Come on.
There's something l'd like you to give Henry for his cathedral fund.
That has been my lucky piece - not that it's brought me luck, except knowing you. lt's an old Roman coin. l picked it up years ago in Brindisi. lt has little value.
- lt's a wonderful contribution.
- Nonsense. lt might be called the ''widow's mite'' if it weren't for the fact that l'm not a widow.
Why, Julia, this is no occasion for tears. lt's stopped snowing. lf only we could spend Christmas back here where we were so happy.
- With you and all of our old friends.
- Now, now, now.
Good night, Professor. l'll see you again very soon. lt can't be soon enough. Good night, Julia.
Why, Professor! How fine to see you again after all these years. How well you look.
- How are you?
- Never better. And you?
Quite well also, thank you.
- l don't think you remember me.
- Of course l do. Where did we meet?
- Professor, after all these years...
- Just a moment.
- lt wasn't Vienna, was it?
- Beautiful old Vienna.
The university. When l was lecturing there on Roman history.
And what great lectures they were.
And what a one you were with the ladies.
Fancy you remembering that.
- l must confess, l had my moments.
- And still have.
- Where are you going?
- That car. l couldn't help noticing your tender parting from Julia.
- You know Julia?
- ln a way, yes.
- Poor child.
- She's unhappy?
- When were you in Vienna?
- Oh, l've been there many times. l'm interested in Julia and Henry.
What seems to be their trouble? l never see Henry any more.
He has no time for riffraff like me.
He now consorts with the vulgar rich, like Mrs Hamilton.
You know she had me fired from the university here? Said l was a radical. l, who have never taken any interest in politics since the death of Nero.
Look at that. Henry's old church, perishing from neglect.
- lt's such a nice little church.
- Too little, l'm afraid. lt can't stand up against the march of progress.
Well, l must be pushing on.
- Delighted to have seen you.
- A pleasure.
We must have a drink to those old days in Vienna.
By all means!
- Good evening, Professor.
- Oh, Pat?
Have you any idea who that man is?
No. He's a stranger to me.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Matilda. Hello, Queenie.
- ls Debby in bed yet?
- Yes, ma'am.
Mrs Hamilton and the committee are in there with the bishop.
The dinner's been waiting a long time.
We didn't know what to do about it.
- We'll have dinner as soon as they leave.
- But what about the chicken?
Don't worry about it, Matilda, please.
Thank you.
Oh, Matilda. My bag.
Thank you.
Oh, l'm terribly sorry l'm so late.
Good evening, Mrs Hamilton. l was delayed Christmas shopping.
Good evening, Mr Perry, Mrs Trumbull.
Hello, Mrs Ward. l hope you've been having a good meeting.
We have not. l've never in my life encountered such fuzzy thinking.
- Do you think we've made any progress?
- No.
- Mr Perry was about to tell us something.
- Merely a suggestion. lf Mrs Hamilton approves, we can place the George B Hamilton
Memorial Chapel here on the north-east. lt will be out of sight there. l won't stand for it.
Mrs Hamilton, this cathedral cannot be designed for the glory of an individual.
- lt has to be created for all the people.
- l'm very displeased at your attitude. l was instrumental in making you Bishop, although others thought you too young.
- ls that an exaggeration?
- Oh, yes, Mrs... l mean, no.
- You were the guiding spirit.
- l distinctly remember... l had confidence in you when you were a poor little parson in the slums. l confess my confidence is weakened. l regret l've been a disappointment.
Regrets are no good whatsoever.
You give me the impression of being confused, indecisive and ineffectual.
That is not the kind of leadership we expect of our bishop.
You'd better remember one thing.
You will build that cathedral as l want it or you will not build it at all.
That's all l have to say.
- Someone get this dog out of the way.
- Julia?
Queenie.
- Goodbye, Mrs Hamilton.
- Good evening, Mrs Brougham.
- Good evening, Mrs Brougham.
- Good evening, Mrs Brougham.
- Can we serve dinner now?
- Yes, Matilda.
- The chicken will be burned to a crisp.
- We'll be right in.
Julia, you knew Mrs Hamilton was expected this afternoon. l know, Henry. l'm sorry l was late.
What a ghastly afternoon.
What a ghastly woman. l have no intention of being strangled by her purse strings. l was proud of you. l had a most un-Christian impulse to give her a good whack over the... mink coat. l thought you stood up to her magnificently. l appreciate your appreciation but what about my cathedral?
May l make a suggestion, Henry?
Why not postpone the cathedral till after Christmas? lmpossible. The House of God can't be put off. This cathedral must rise.
Plenty of rich people in this town. l'll have to take advantage of their Yuletide spirit. l can see it all now.
The McWhirters, the Hornes, the Van
Deusens, the lunches, the meetings and you there flattering them.
- Kowtowing to them, begging.
- lt's got to be done.
Oh, Henry. lf you could see your poor harassed face.
- You haven't done very much to help it.
- Miss Cassaway, what is it?
- Mr Trevor on the phone, Bishop.
- Tell him the bishop will call him back.
Yes, Mrs Brougham.
Henry, what's happened to you?
What's happened to our marriage?
We used to have such fun, you and Debby and l.
We used to be happy and make other people happy.
Henry, that was your gift.
You're no financier or promoter.
Julia, l want this cathedral to stand like a great beacon. l want its light...
Oh, never mind. Keep that for your next committee meeting.
- Here's a contribution l collected.
- What's that? lt's an old Roman coin. Professor
Wutheridge sent it. Wasn't that sweet?
Old fool. What does he think l can do with that?
Well, it's a beginning.
Now all you need is another four million.
Julia, don't be flippant about this!
- ls dinner ready?
- Yes.
Let's go in and get it over with. l have a lot of work to do.
For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.
- Julia?
- Yes? l was just thinking... tomorrow maybe we could go out together.
Where?
Well, just walk around the way we used to.
We could go and call on the professor, go to the park and watch the skaters - that sort of thing.
Maybe we could have lunch together.
At Michel's. Do you remember that?
Michel's. Oh, it's been years since we've been there.
Forgive me. l've been trying to explain to Mr Trevor, but he insists upon speaking to you personally, Bishop.
Excuse me, darling.
Matilda, keep the soup warm.
The bishop's been called to the phone.
- And we'll be out for lunch tomorrow.
- Yes, ma'am.
Of course, Mr Trevor. Yes, but... l appreciate your difficulties, but...
Very well. l'll be there.
10.30 tomorrow morning, then on to the board meeting.
All right. Yes. Goodbye.
Mr Trevor's office, 10.30, then the board meeting in the Banker's Club at eleven.
- Yes, sir. Tomorrow. Thursday.
- You might as well go home.
- But there's a great deal to do.
- You must be tired.
Thank you. Don't forget tomorrow you speak at the Junior Assembly.
- What time is that?
- One o'clock.
You made the appointment over a month ago.
- Good night, Bishop.
- Good night.
Oh, God, what am l to do?
Can't you help me?
Can't you tell me?
Oh, God, please help me.
Yes?
- Good evening.
- Good eve...
- What can l do for you?
- That isn't the question.
Well, what is the...?
What can l do for you? l must ask you to telephone my secretary. l'm in the middle of dinner. l know, Henry. Your soup will keep warm.
You asked for help. l? l... Who told you l asked for help?
Well, you were known to be a good man,
Henry, and you were heard. l was instructed to come here in answer to your prayer.
- Who are you?
- l'm an angel.
- l beg your pardon?
- l'm an angel.
- No wings at the moment, but...
- You're an angel. l knew it. l've been working too hard. l understand, Henry. lt's hard to believe, even for you. l'm not one of the more important angels. l just happen to be assigned to this district temporarily.
You see, we're everywhere, helping people who deserve to be...
..to be helped.
As you're walking through the city, you may look into a strange face. lt may be the face of a murderer or it may be the face of an angel.
You have some problems with the building of this cathedral?
- Yes.
- lt's a fine cathedral.
Ought to look magnificent up there on top of Sanctuary Hill.
Well, Henry.
Do you believe l am what l say l am?
How can l? l've only got your word for it.
But you're a bishop.
You can trust the word of an angel. l'd like to.
What do you propose to do?
- Perform a miracle?
- lf necessary.
Why don't you? Create the cathedral with one wave of your hand.
- How would you explain it?
- Well, l...
Tell the world you're being visited by an angel?
You can't do that.
Henry, is anything wrong? l...
- Oh. l'm sorry. l didn't know you had...
- Julia. lf you don't mind...
How do you do, Julia? l'm Dudley.
Henry is engaging me to help him with his work.
- You're going to be his assistant?
- That's it. l'm going to help Henry to rest and get some relaxation.
- That's what l've been praying for.
- You too?
Henry. l'm so relieved. lsn't it wonderful you've found someone to help?
- Yes, but...
- Where do you come from?
- All around.
- Yes. But where?
Julia, to tell you the truth, he says that he's an a... l've been doing some social service work down town.
Now you'll be with Henry permanently?
For as long as may be necessary.
Julia, if you don't mind. l must talk to this gentleman alone. l'll see you in a moment.
We were just having dinner.
Won't you join us?
That's very kind of you, but l have a number of things to do.
You can understand, Henry.
So many people making mistakes.
- Yes. l see.
- Then we'll see you tomorrow?
- Oh, yes. Bright and early.
- Good.
Whenever you're ready, Henry.
Good night, Dudley.
Good night, Julia.
Are you sure you're an angel? l know it isn't easy, but you've got to take me on faith.
- Yes, but for how long?
- For just long enough.
Until you can utter another prayer and say that you have no further need of me.
Then l'll be gone and forgotten.
But now Julia's waiting for you at the dining table. You must go to her.
Yes.
But l don't...
- Henry?
- Yes?
What's the rest of Dudley's name?
- l don't know.
- Oh.
Are you nervous, dear?
No.
- The bishop didn't eat his breakfast.
- No. He took only his prune juice.
Prune juice? ls he sick?
He looked perfectly awful.
He said he had a very bad sleepless night.
Passing up a breakfast like that. lt just ain't normal.
Nobody expects him to be normal.
He's a bishop.
- Could l get you something, sir?
- No, thank you, Matilda.
- Maybe just a cup of tea?
- Nothing, thank you.
- Good morning, Miss Cassaway.
- Good morning, Bishop.
Did anything come for the Cathedral Fund?
Mr and Mrs J Thurston Ward.
No contribution.
- Mrs Gerald Wilmarth. $1 5.
- 1 5? We had her down for ten thousand.
There's a letter explaining that this year... l know. The same letter they all write. l've put your personal mail on the desk.
The rest l'm taking to the office. l'll be there after the meetings.
Oh. Matilda, l think there's someone at the door.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Matilda. l'm Dudley, the bishop's new assistant.
Good morning, Henry. l'm afraid l'm a little late, but l stopped to chat to a traffic policeman who was worried about his wife.
Thank you, dear. So l directed the traffic while he telephoned the hospital.
- l see.
- She's doing fine. So's the baby.
Why, you must be Mildred Cassaway.
How do you do?
- How do you do?
- We're going to be working together.
That's very nice.
Oh, thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- See you later, Mildred.
Well. Ready for duty.
Completely at your service.
- No, no.
- l feel that...
No.
- Good morning, Julia.
- Good morning, Dudley. lt's a lovely day.
- Lovely.
- Henry and l are going out.
- l'm sorry, but l have some appointments.
- You what?
There's Mr Trevor, then the board meeting and the Junior Assembly.
- But, Henry, you promised.
- l know l did.
Well, Dudley could represent you at those meetings, couldn't he?
Could l?
No. They expect me. lt would never do if l sent an a... assistant.
Excuse me.
Now...
Oh.
- The trouble is l can't explain.
- You needn't try to explain.
This is the way it is and the way it will always be.
We've just got to get used to it, that's all. l'll tell Matilda she can have the day off and l'll take care of Debby. l see that Mrs George B Hamilton has pledged $1 million
- but has not yet sent her cheque.
- Never mind.
That's work for a bookkeeper, not an ange... Work for a bookkeeper.
Aha. So you're beginning to believe in me? l don't know who you are, where you came from or who sent you. l just wish you'd make haste.
- Because the cathedral must be built?
- That's the most important thing.
Or because Julia must be happy? lt's going to be difficult to help you until l'm sure what you want.
Well, l've got the...
Then there's... Oh.
Would you mind telling me what you intend to do now?
This card index file is in an awful mess. l'll reorganise it.
You're wasting time on unimportant details.
Nothing's unimportant. We are interested even in the lowliest sparrow.
- Hello, Debby.
- Are you Dudley?
- Yes. How did you know?
- Mummy told me.
She said you came to help Daddy.
- That's right.
- Mummy said you were very nice.
Well, that's extremely kind of Mummy.
Mummy said that maybe with you here we will get to see Daddy sometimes.
- Maybe we will.
- That'll be enough out of you, Debby. l asked Matilda to put your lunch on a tray.
- Thank you, Julia. l'll get along very well.
- l'm sure you will. Come on.
- Goodbye, Dudley.
- Bye-bye, Debby.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Oh.
- Oh. Thank you, Matilda.
- Aren't you going to wear a hat?
- l never use one.
- lt's very cold out.
- Oh, the cold never affects me.
- l think you should wear this. l bought it for the bishop last Christmas, but he's never worn it. lt's a lovely scarf. l'm sure the bishop will appreciate it when he sees it on me.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Bye.
Goodbye.
- What's the matter, honey?
- They don't want me.
- Why not?
- l guess l'm too little or something.
Oh. Now, now.
Why, that's the most ridiculous thing l've ever heard.
Why, Dudley.
Come on, Debby.
We'll show them how wrong they are.
Hey, fellas. Hey, fellas!
Who's the head man around here?
- l am.
- l am.
- What's the idea of this game?
- This isn't a game. This is a battle.
We attack the fort and they try to defend it. See? l see. Well, this young lady would like to get into it.
- Who, her?
- She can't fight. Her father's a bishop.
What difference does it make? Are you high-hat? You like her on your team?
She couldn't throw a snowball as far as l could spit.
Oh, couldn't she? Come on, Debby.
You show them what you can do.
- But it's true. l can't throw.
- Nonsense. Of course you can.
Pack it tight, put it in that hand, throw the arm back, aim it and let it go.
- Hey!
- Beautiful! A bullseye.
- She pitched a curve.
- Did you see that?
Come on, kid. You're in our army.
We've broken their morale.
Charge!
- Will she get hurt?
- Probably, but she'll love it.
- May l?
- Surely.
Dudley, what are you doing out here?
- l'm just admiring the scenery.
- But aren't you supposed to be working? l always take a walk before lunch.
A good idea - relaxing.
Oh. l wish you could persuade Henry to do that. l'll try.
By the way, l told Miss Cassaway to go home and Delia not to bring me a tray.
What will you do about lunch? l thought l'd go to Michel's.
Ever heard of it?
Michel's. That's a lovely place.
We used to go there.
That was years ago.
Well, how about you and l going there today?
You and...? To Mich...?
Oh, no, l couldn't.
Why not? Surely you don't think
Henry would mind?
- l'd explain to him that we just...
- No, it isn't that, but...
Matilda's off Christmas shopping so l have to look after Debby.
Well, here's Matilda now.
- Hello. lf you wish... Oh, hello.
- Hello.
- lf you wish, l'll take Debby home.
- But, Matilda, your shopping... l finished it. l finished it so quick it was just like a miracle.
Mummy! We won!
Oh, Debby, that's wonderful!
Congratulations.
- Come on! We're giving out the medals.
- Put up your hood, dear.
- Madam, welcome.
- Oh, Michel.
- lt's been a long time.
- Much too long.
- But you know my husband's work.
- Yes.
He doesn't come to see us any more, but we understand.
We understand.
This way, please.
- ls this satisfactory, monsieur?
- Fine, thank you.
- Friends of yours?
- Yes.
They're members of the Cathedral Committee.
- Madam. Monsieur.
- No, thank you, Michel.
Julia, don't bother to look through that.
Michel, just bring us the best lunch you can think of. l see monsieur is a gourmet.
Perhaps you would be interested in a guinea-hen á la Michel?
- J'ai les truffles Françaises. Exquise!
- Je préfére les ltaliennes.
Préfére les ltaliennes?
Quel sacrilége!
Please, Michel, let's leave heaven out of this.
Je préfére les ltaliennes surtout pas de cayenne, du paprika.
Du paprika? Du paprika.
You speak French beautifully. l've had quite a bit of work to do in Paris.
- Dudley, l've been wondering about you.
- Wondering about me? Why?
You know so much.
Makes me feel uncomfortable.
Well, in that case, l'm sorry l learned anything.
But l'm glad you knew about Michel.
Oh, it's so nice to be back here again.
So nice.
You have memories of this place, Julia?
- Did you and Henry come here often?
- Yes.
This is where we became engaged to be married.
Ah. Then l can understand why you love it.
- Oh, hello.
- Pardon me.
Thank you. What about that?
My. Would you care to have your palm read?
Oh, no, thank you.
Would you?
No, thanks. l know too much about myself as it is.
You are different. l know so little about myself.
Really? May l look at your hand?
- Can you do that too?
- lt's not too difficult.
- You can read the future?
- Within limits.
He's holding her hand.
Well, what do you see?
Well, l never noticed.
Your eyes are green. l see a great deal of happiness. l see a woman who's adored. l see a rich, full life.
- Do you see Henry's new cathedral?
- No. There's a fuzziness about that.
- Oh. And Debby?
- No need to worry about her.
Just thinking. The world changes but two things remain constant.
- What?
- Youth and beauty.
They're really one and the same thing.
- Yes. The trouble is people grow old.
- Not everybody.
The only people who grow old were born old to begin with.
You were born young.
You'll remain that way.
- Oh, l wish l could believe you.
- You may.
You haven't looked at my hand once. l never know what to make of you. l never know whether you're joking or serious. l'm at my most serious when l'm joking.
Excuse me, Julia.
Gotta do something about that.
Do forgive me coming to your table.
My name is Dudley. l believe you're all friends of Julia's.
Would you care to join us?
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Well, join us for some coffee?
How about that? Do come over.
Julia would be delighted.
- All right.
- Well, that'd be lovely.
- That's very nice.
- Just over here.
Hello, Mrs Caster.
How are you? Nice to see you.
Hello. How are you?
Michel, bring us three Benedictines.
- No, no. Make it three Stingers.
- Oui, monsieur.
Julia?
Julia!
Julia!
- Matilda, is lunch ready?
- We thought you were out for lunch. l cancelled my appointment. ls Mrs Brougham home?
- Debby's here, sir.
- And Mrs Brougham?
Why, sir, she went out to lunch with Mr Dudley.
- With Dudley?
- Why, yes, sir. l thought you knew, sir.
Yes, of course.
That's awful. Merry Christmas.
Santa Claus doesn't really look like that.
- You know Santa Claus?
- Certainly. Nice chap.
You must tell Debby about him. She's just beginning to be a little bit doubtful.
- You like that hat?
- Yes, l'm crazy about it.
- Well, let's go in and buy it.
- Oh, no, l couldn't.
- Why, it's much too...
- Too what? Too attractive?
- My old friend, the professor.
- Hello, Professor.
- Julia! Are you with this man?
- Yes, of course. lt's Dudley.
The professor knows me well.
University of Vienna. l've been thinking about that. l don't believe you've ever been to Vienna.
He always pretends he's never seen me before. l don't know who he is, but l don't trust him.
- Professor, he's Henry's new assistant.
- Oh.
- You know this fellow?
- Of course l do.
Well, in that case, how about dropping in for a bit of Yuletide cheer?
No, no. l have to go home. l...
Well, perhaps just for a few minutes.
Good. Come along.
There's a little sherry left. lt's rather inferior grade, but potable.
Professor, l see you're a religious man.
- What makes you think that?
- You have an angel on your tree.
Julia gave me that years ago.
- Your tree is beautiful.
- lt's disgraceful.
However, it gives me the illusion of peace on earth, goodwill toward men.
- To a charming lady.
- Lovely.
- You've noticed?
- lsn't it remarkable that you have?
Remarkable? When you want to know about a woman, ask the old men.
They know.
Why don't you show us the manuscript of your book?
- My book?
- Yes.
- Oh, no, no.
- You're writing one?
Yes.
- You didn't know?
- You didn't tell me. l described that book in detail at the lectures l gave at the University of Vienna.
All my pupils heard me.
Now l'm certain this fellow's an impostor.
That book? l thought you'd finished that years ago. l'll tell you... l'll tell you about my book.
For 20 years l've been talking about it and promising the publishers it'll be delivered next spring.
The funny part is that l haven't written one word.
- Not one word.
- Why not? l couldn't think of anything original to say.
Just the same old monotonous history.
Dry as dust.
That's the whole story of my life.
Frustration. lt's a chronic disease and it's incurable.
Once l was madly...
Once l was madly in love with a girl.
My friends, she was a vision of delight.
A pure enchantress.
- You never told me about it.
- That's the trouble. l never told her about it either. l couldn't find the words.
So she married an athlete.
A great hulking oaf who never even reached the eighth grade.
But he knew how to say ''l love you.''
Same trouble with my book.
Can't find the words.
Even when you had this coin to inspire you?
Why, that's the one that you gave to Henry.
- Yes. l stole it off the table.
- You wasted your time. lt's worthless.
On the contrary, this is one of the rarest of all antiquities.
Only one hundred of these coins were minted by Julius Caesar 2,000 years ago.
That was when Cleopatra visited Rome.
Presumably, these were used to pay her hotel bill.
- l never knew that.
- Nobody knew except Caesar's wife.
- She was suspicious?
- Definitely.
She did not share her husband's admiration for Cleopatra.
So she had these coins destroyed - melted into ornaments.
This is the one she missed. lt's an unwritten chapter in history and you, Professor, will write it.
- Do you know any more stories like that?
- Any number of them.
- You're a curious fellow, Dudley.
- Have you just begun to notice?
- What's your background?
- My background?
- Where do you come from?
- Well...
And don't tell me more about Vienna because l won't believe it.
All right. lf l told you l came from another planet, would you believe me?
- l don't know.
- l'd believe you, Dudley.
And you'd be right, Julia, as always.
We all come from our own little planets.
That's why we're all different.
That's what makes life interesting.
We don't seem to be making any headway.
First star l see tonight.
You must make a wish, Julia.
Oh, it's getting dark. Must be late. Henry will be worried. We must be leaving.
- Oh, no.
- Yes. l'm sorry, Professor, but we must.
- Dudley?
- Yes, my friend.
- There's one thing that troubles me.
- What's that? l'm an old man.
That history is a tremendous task. l wonder... will l have time to finish it?
You'll finish your history, Professor.
You'll have time. l believe you, Dudley.
For quite a while now, every time l passed a cemetery, l've felt as if l were apartment hunting.
Goodbye, Professor.
You've given an old man a very happy afternoon.
- God bless you both.
- Thank you. l'll pass that recommendation along.
My, that's pretty.
Why don't you take some of that pink stuff and make little curlicues?
- l hope the dinner won't be spoilt.
- No, sir. l had a feeling they might be late.
Yes... Very considerate of you.
What's that cake for?
- What cake?
- That cake behind you.
That cake. Oh, for anybody who might like cakes, sir.
But neither Mrs Brougham nor myself like elaborate desserts.
But we've baked you an egg custard, sir.
Hello, dear. l'm sorry we were late for dinner.
- Good evening.
- We've had a marvellous time.
- l wish you'd been with us.
- Debby told me about the snow fight.
Did she? We went to see Professor
Wutheridge and we had lunch at Michel's.
- ls Debby in bed?
- No. She's waiting to see you.
Good. l'll just go up and say good night. l won't be a minute. l just want to see if she's all right.
- l trust you spent a profitable afternoon?
- Oh, yes.
Did you have a profitable afternoon?
Not very. l'd like to see you... for a moment.
Certainly.
Excuse me.
Can you prove to me that you are an angel?
Proof? You mean a document?
Surely you of all people should know that an angel needs no passport. l want to see you perform a miracle.
- What kind?
- Well...
Make this desk fly around the room.
Please. l didn't come down here to do silly tricks. l'm surprised at you. l don't believe you're an angel.
- l think you're a demon right out of...
- Oh, Henry. Don't say that.
- Well, anyway, you know how l feel.
- Yes.
Wait a minute.
There's another thing.
Oh. Dinner is served, Bishop.
Thank you, Dudley.
For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.
Pass the celery, Henry, please.
- Hm?
- The celery.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What's that you're humming? l don't know, dear. ls it anything?
- lt's rather gay.
- Well, l feel gay. l like to watch you brushing your hair.
Thank you, dear. ls that a compliment?
Yes. You do it so... so capably.
Thank you. ln fact, now l come to think of it, everything you do is capable. l pride myself on the fact that we lead a well-ordered life. The family, l mean.
Of course, the credit for that is due to you much more than to me.
- l think you're an excellent wife.
- Thank you.
- Do you think l'm an excellent husband?
- Of course.
We're having an early supper so we get to St Timothy's on time.
- St Timothy's?
- The rehearsal for the benefit.
- Oh, yes.
- You've been looking awfully tired lately. l hope you're going to take it easier now that Dudley's here.
- l think that he's very able.
- You do?
- Yes. He knows so many things.
- What, for instance?
You should have seen him with Professor Wutheridge.
He knows more about history than the professor.
He's been at it longer.
- (Dudley) Let's do that again.
- No. Tell me a story.
- What, now?
- Don't you know any stories?
- l know hundreds of stories.
- Tell me one. Please.
All right. Let me think.
This happened many, many years ago.
That's not the way to begin.
Stories start ''Once upon a time''.
Yes, that's true.
Once upon a time there was a little boy and he lived in a little town.
- What was his name?
- His name was David. He was a shepherd.
The town was called Bethlehem. l know Bethlehem.
That's where the star was.
That's right.
Only David lived long before the star.
One night, David was out in the hills tending his sheep.
- He was playing the harp and singing.
- Was he singing ''Jingle Bells''?
No, no. ''Jingle Bells'' hadn't been written then.
David was singing songs that he wrote himself.
Suddenly, an angel came down and spoke to David.
- How did David know it was an angel?
- He didn't know.
And that's the way it always is.
Angels come and put ideas into people's heads and people feel very proud of themselves because they think it was their own idea.
This angel said to David
''One of your lambs has strayed.''
So David put aside his harp and went into the darkness to find the lamb.
The angel guided him.
And when David found the lamb, he saw a great big ferocious lion.
Oh!
So David said to the lion
''You get away from that lamb.''
And the lion said ''You get away from me or l'll eat you too.''
- Did David run away?
- No.
You know why? Because the angel put another idea into his head.
So David took out his sling and he hurled a stone and hit the lion right between the eyes. l bet that lion was surprised!
Yes. And so was David because he didn't know an angel had helped him.
Well, he picked up the lamb and took it back to the fold.
Then he felt so happy that he made up another song. lt started out:
''The Lord is my shepherd. l shall not want.''
''He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.''
''He leadeth me besides the still waters.''
''He restoreth my soul...''
You can tell the rest of this, Henry.
- Some other time.
- Hello, Daddy.
Miss Cassaway, will you get
Mrs Hamilton on the telephone?
- Miss Cassaway? Mrs Hamilton.
- Yes, Bishop.
- Good morning, Julia.
- Dudley. l'll see you in a few minutes. l have to see Matilda.
- Bye, Debby.
- Goodbye, Dudley.
- Thank you.
- Oh. Pretty.
Are you expecting a letter?
One never knows. lf l should get one, the stamp will be worth saving. l'll have Mrs Hamilton in a moment.
- Are you seeing Mrs Hamilton?
- l hope to.
- May l come along? l'd like to meet her.
- Mrs Hamilton? Bishop Brougham.
Hello, Mrs Hamilton. How are you? l'm glad to hear it.
Mrs Hamilton, l'd like to see you today.
This afternoon, if possible.
Yes, it is. lt's very urgent.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Terrible.
You can? Oh, that's splendid.
Thank you so much. l'll be there. Five o'clock this evening.
Thank you, Mrs Hamilton.
Henry, you didn't make an appointment for this afternoon?
Yes. lt was the only time.
You can't do this to Reverend Miller.
The rehearsal's just for you.
They'll get along without me.
There are other things more important.
- Mr Miller will be delighted to see you.
- But it's not the same. You're his bishop. l don't like going alone. lt's the big house at the end of this street, driver.
Dudley, l take it that... that you have the money for the taxi.
No. What makes you think l have money?
Oh, l just thought that you being an a...
Oh, goodness!
- l'm sorry.
- l'm sorry.
That's all right.
Thank you.
- l won't be late. l may even join you.
- Please try. l'll see you in front of St Timothy's in one hour.
- Try.
- l will be there.
- Good.
- This is it, driver.
- Good evening, Bishop.
- How are you, Stevens?
- Mrs Hamilton's in the drawing room, sir.
- Thank you.
Well, Bishop Brougham.
My dear Mrs Hamilton, l've come to tell you...
- You've come to apologise, l trust.
- Exactly.
Upon consideration, my objections seem petty compared with the generosity of your gesture. l'm very much relieved.
Sit down, Mr Brougham.
What hurt most was to think that my instinct had betrayed me in recommending you for your position. l'm unceasingly grateful.
Now, l'm taking it for granted that the George B Hamilton Memorial
Chapel shall be located...
Just where you specified.
You no longer feel the effect will be that it was built in my husband's honour?
That was said in dispute.
What matters is the cathedral be built.
Good. l will not have his name on some horrid little brass plaque.
No. lt'll be incised in marble.
Large letters. Gilded.
That large window depicting St George and the dragon. l should like that the countenance of St George suggests my late husband.
Yes. Who do you see as the dragon?
- Oh. Any dragon. Let's get the blueprints.
- Oh, Mrs Hamilton.
As we're in agreement, would you mind if we postpone discussing the details?
Julia's waiting at St Timothy's.
Very well. We can go over the plans when we transfer the funds.
Thank you. And l'm so glad we've settled our differences.
- ls anything the matter?
- Well... lt doesn't seem quite right.
Oh. Stevens. There's something wrong about the bishop's chair.
Madam, it must be the new varnish.
The finisher should have warned us.
- l do hope l'm not harming the chair.
- No, no, not at all.
Send to a furniture shop or a plumbers or... Turpentine. Do something.
Yes, madam. Oh, dear.
- l wonder...
- Would you give it a pull at the back?
Thank you. lt's been a long time since Henry's been down here. l wish he had come.
You know, when he was here, he was so close to people, so loved by everybody.
Uh-huh. And how does it seem to you now?
That he's moved away from the people he loved?
Yes. lt's going to be a disappointment for Reverend Miller not to see him.
Well, he doesn't have to be disappointed.
- Hello, Mr Miller.
- Mrs Brougham, so good of you to come. l'm delighted to be here.
This is Mr Dudley, the bishop's assistant.
- Mr Dudley, a pleasure.
- Thank you, Mr Miller.
The bishop will try to get here later.
- Oh. Of course. He's a busy man now.
- Yes.
- This is Mrs Duffy.
- l know Mrs Duffy. How are you?
- lt's always an honour to have you here.
- Thank you. This is Mr Dudley.
- Mrs Duffy is the organist.
- l'm sure she plays enchantingly.
- Hello, Mrs Duffy.
- l'm afraid some of our boys are late.
We really should begin, but l don't see how we can. lt's quite embarrassing.
But it is a little difficult to compete with basketball and Christmas.
- They're all good boys at heart.
- l know they are. They'll show up. l hope so.
- Hello, Bobby.
- Hello.
- What do you sing?
- First soprano.
- Are you good?
- l don't know.
- How about giving out?
- Me alone?
- You've got George. Hello, George.
- Hello.
- What do you say?
- OK.
- Are you ready, Mrs Duffy?
- Yes.
Hit it.
Boys, that was beautiful.
Really beautiful.
You've all grown up so since the bishop and l lived in this parish that l hardly recognised any of you.
But l'm so proud of you and l know he's going to be too.
Oh, thank you.
Mr Miller, that was wonderful. l can't thank you enough, Mrs Brougham.
And you, Mr Dudley.
Oh, l'm so sorry the bishop couldn't have been here.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.
Whatever is keeping Stevens?
Oh, Stevens. There you are. l'm sorry, madam, but the furniture shop is closed until after New Year, l can't find a plumber and we're out of turpentine.
- This is preposterous!
- Would some witch hazel be of any use?
- Might l use your telephone?
- Of course. lt's over there.
Matilda, this is Bishop Brougham. l'm at Mrs Hamilton's.
Will you bring me another pair of trousers?
What difference does it make?
Just bring me another pair of trousers. l'm so very sorry this has happened. lf only l could get in touch with Julia or Dudley.
Now don't be nervous, Bishop.
- Have a chair.
- Thank you. l have one.
He isn't here.
Perhaps the meeting was more important than he thought. l suppose. We'd better go on home.
- You know, Dudley, it's a strange thing.
- What's strange?
You're able to make me feel as if everything's going to be all right.
- Well, it could be if...
- lf what? lf people could only learn to behave like human beings.
Hey, taxi.
Here's a cab, Julia.
- Will you please wait, Sylvester?
- OK. Sure. l'll wait. Sylvester?!
Good evening. l'll be right with you.
Now this is one of our most exclusive models.
Oh, it's lovely, just simply ravishing.
- So chic. So young.
- lt is sweet, isn't it?
Stunning.
Not everyone could wear such a daring hat, but it was made for madame.
Say, how did you know my name was Sylvester? lt's up there on your card.
Oh.
Sylvester, could you drive through the park?
- That's way out of your way.
- Are you getting bored with us?
Oh, no. l'll drive you by way of Mexico City if you want.
Thank you.
Dudley, l'm having so much fun.
- Are you, Julia?
- Yes. l feel as if l were doing something wicked.
- Why?
- l don't know.
Somehow it seems wrong to have so much fun, but... l can't figure out what's wrong about it.
You folks know what the main trouble with this country is?
Oh, l've heard several versions of that.
- Do you know, Sylvester?
- l think l do.
There are too many people who don't know where they're going and they wanna get there too fast.
Take you two. l'd call you unusual.
Thank you. You're very perceptive.
First, you know your destination, but you're in no hurry to get there.
You wanna enjoy some scenery en route and you're not reluctant to spend an extra four bits for a detour with Mother Nature.
- (tyres sceech)
- Hey, look where you're goin'!
Well... Well, my goodness.
Did you see the way l missed that truck?
- lt was just like a miracle.
- Yes, but don't overplay your hand.
Oh.
Sylvester, pull up here.
Come on. We're going skating.
No, we mustn't, it's late. We couldn't.
Do you think we could?
Henry's waited this long.
He can wait a little longer. Stop the car.
- l am wicked.
- lf you are, so am l, and that's impossible.
- Can you skate, Sylvester?
- l used to, but l'm too old now.
Come on. You'll find out how young you are.
Ooh! l'm not quite so sure of myself.
Now relax. That's right.
- Oh!
- That's right.
Oh.
Pretty hat.
- Why, Dudley!
- Now you.
- Oh, no.
- Come on.
- Dudley, this is heavenly.
- You found the perfect word.
Look! Look what l'm doing.
You're a beautiful skater, Julia. ln fact, you're beautiful.
Oh, look! Look at Sylvester.
Go on, Sylvester!
Oh, my God!
- Excuse me.
- Surely.
Keep cool, Sylvester. Keep cool.
Relax.
That's right. Come on.
Give me the other one. That's it.
All right. Now relax.
Don't collapse. Just relax.
Hang on to me now.
Oh! Don't leave me!
Don't! Ooh!
How am l doing, Dudley?
Wait for me, Dudley!
Thank you.
- How much do l owe you, Sylvester?
- Not a cent, my friend.
My pockets are just bulging with the coins of self-satisfaction.
- You wanna know why?
- l'd love to know.
Because you and the little lady have restored my faith in human nature.
Good night, Dudley. Good night, Julia.
- Good night, Sylvester.
- Good night, Sylvester.
Sylvester is a noble soul.
His children and his children's children will rise up and call him Blessed.
Dudley, this has been the most wonderful evening l've had in years.
This has been the most wonderful evening l've had in centuries.
- l hope l haven't left the key home.
- lt's open.
Thank you, Dudley. Hello, Queenie.
- Hello, Queenie. May l help you?
- Yes, please.
- Oh! You took off my shoe.
- Hello, Henry.
Henry, what happened? l thought you were going to meet us at St Timothy's.
- What happened to you? lt's very late.
- Thank you. You'll never guess.
We went skating. There you are.
See you in a minute, Henry.
- Skating?
- Yes. Dudley's a marvellous skater.
He even made me imagine that l was good.
You should have heard those boys sing at St Timothy's. lt was heavenly.
- l'm sure.
- Did you have a successful meeting?
- Did you?
- Satisfactory.
Good. l want to see Debby before she goes to sleep.
Oh. You haven't said a word about it.
- About what?
- My hat. My new hat.
- What do you think?
- Charming.
Thank you. l'll be right down.
One thing l know,
Julia is absolutely blameless.
- Of course she is.
- You stopped me from joining you.
Julia had a very good time.
- Well, l didn't.
- Hm. lf you'd sent me to Mrs Hamilton, l would have gone.
You didn't.
So l represented you with your wife. ls that part of the normal duties of an...?
..of an angel?
Sometimes, Henry, angels must rush in where fools fear to tread. l haven't the faintest idea what that means and l don't want it explained.
- You can go now. l've solved my problem.
- Have you?
Mrs Hamilton is giving the money for the cathedral.
That was a foregone conclusion if you were willing to sacrifice your principles.
Don't you think it's worth it for this glorious edifice? l'm not sure of its glory at a time like this.
- Oh, you're not?
- No, Henry, l'm not.
These are lean years for the world.
So many people need food.
So many people need shelter.
That big roof could make so many little roofs.
We're dealing with a materialistic, selfish woman. She wouldn't listen to that.
- Did you try?
- lt's all arranged. lt's finished.
You came so l could have a cathedral and now l want you to go. l want you to get out of my life and away from Julia.
Suppose you pray for that? lt was your prayer that brought me here.
Mm-mm. Henry, that was no prayer. lt was right from my heart. l want you to go.
- Julia doesn't.
- Julia.
Get out! Get out!
Julia's ready to come down the stairs.
Don't let her see you like that.
Try to calm yourself, Henry.
Dudley? Debby wants Dudley to come up and say good night to her. Where is he?
- He's gone.
- Where?
- How should l know?
- Why did he leave so suddenly?
- l told him to go away. l fired him.
- Why?
He's incompetent, he's no good at his job and l cannot stand the sight of him!
Mummy, l'm sure that Dudley's never coming back.
Darling, you must never say never.
But where is he?
Come here, dear.
Now listen to me.
Dudley wouldn't leave us without saying a word.
Besides, he was going to tell you about Santa Claus.
He knows Santa Claus very well.
But it's almost Christmas Eve.
Soon l'll have to go to bed.
He wouldn't leave us without saying a word. Would he, Matilda?
Oh, no, no. That wouldn't be like him.
Not like Mr Dudley.
Come along, Debby. l'll get you ready for dinner.
Will you come see me when you get back, Mummy?
Of course, dear.
Here is a list of your calls.
Ending at Mrs Hamilton's.
Thank you. Miss Cassaway, here is the manuscript of my Christmas sermon. l shall want the original and five carbons for issuing to the press. lf you get the typing done before l come back, leave it on my desk. l'm sorry to keep you so long on Christmas Eve.
Of course, sir. l understand. lt must be done.
Henry, l'm ready to start out now.
We go first to the Trubshawes, then the...
- Then we go to the Vandovers.
- Goodbye, Miss Cassaway.
Sylvester!
- Hello, Julia.
- Hello. What are you doing here? l've been waiting around hoping there'd be another skating party and l didn't want to miss it. Where's
Dudley? Oh, you got a preacher with you.
- This is my...
- Oh, l know!
There's gonna be a wedding ceremony.
You and Dudley.
Sylvester, this is my husband,
Bishop Brougham.
- How do you do?
- Oh.
- Oh.
- 247 North Maple.
247 North Maple.
- Mildred?
- Oh!
Oh, why, Dudley, it's you. l didn't see you...
Where have you been?
We've been worrying about you.
- And poor Mrs Brougham...
- What about Mrs Brougham?
She's been popping in and out of here all day asking ''Have you seen Dudley?''
- Where is she?
- She and the bishop had some calls.
Finishing at Mrs Hamilton's.
- Let me type that sermon for you.
- No.
You go on. lt's almost Christmas Eve.
You must have shopping to do.
- Oh, well...
- Go on, Mildred.
Thank you, Dudley.
- Merry Christmas, Mildred.
- Merry Christmas, Dudley.
Merry... Oh.
Take a sermon.
Tonight, l want to tell you the story of an empty stocking.
Once upon a midnight clear there was a child's cry.
A blazing star hung over a stable and wise men came with birthday gifts.
Have you got that? Good. We haven't forgotten that night down the centuries.
We celebrate it with stars hung on the Christmas tree, bells and gifts - especially with gifts.
We buy them and wrap them and put them under the tree.
You give me a tie. l give you a book.
Aunt Martha always wanted an orange squeezer.
Uncle Harry can use a new pipe.
Oh, we forget nobody - adult or child.
All the stockings are filled.
All, that is, except one.
Oh! Oh...
- l'm sorry, Matilda.
- Oh, Mr Dudley. l knew you'd come back.
- l knew you hadn't walked out on us.
- Of course not.
Debby's been so worried and as for Mrs Brougham...
Well, run upstairs.
Tell Debby l'll see her later.
- First l have some work to do.
- l'll tell her.
One moment, please. Mrs Hamilton expecting you?
No, but she'll wish to see me. l'm the bishop's assistant.
The bishop is expected, but not the assistant. l told you, Stevens, she'll wish to see me.
Yes.
Yes.
''This was composed for you, my darling, and you only. Allan.''
Her husband's name was George.
Good evening.
That music you were playing.
No one living but me knows that composition. lt's a shame that only you and l appreciate the lost genius of Allan Cartwright.
- You know about Allan Cartwright?
- Oh, yes.
The world lost a brilliant young composer when he was... when he died.
That was nearly 40 years ago.
You couldn't have known him. l'm much older than you think.
Come, let's sit down.
- What is your name?
- My name is Dudley.
But tell me about Allan and you.
Tell me.
Allan Cartwright was the only man l ever loved.
We were engaged to be married and l got frightened.
He had nothing and l was afraid of poverty.
He went away. l never saw him again. l never loved George Hamilton.
He was very much in love with me and he was wealthy. l've spent a fortune honouring his memory in empty monuments.
The Hamilton mansion.
Never took a call here.
- What do l owe you?
- No charge. l got nothing better to do.
- Thank you, Sylvester.
- l'll be seeing you, Julia.
There's someone at the door. lt's Henry and Julia.
Oh. The bishop.
No, l won't. l can't see him now.
- Oh, yes, you will.
- No... Yes.
That's right, Agnes. Just go out and greet them in your usual warm-hearted manner.
- The bishop and Mrs Brougham, madam.
- Yes.
Oh. You'll stay for dinner, Dudley? l'm afraid l can't, Agnes. l have a great deal of work to do.
But don't keep Henry and Julia waiting.
- Julia.
- How do you do, Mrs Hamilton?
How nice of you to come and see me.
And Henry. A merry Christmas.
A merry Christmas.
Come, let's go into the drawing room.
- Henry?
- Yes, Mrs Hamilton. Merry Christmas.
Come, Henry, we're very old friends.
You must call me Agnes.
- And you too, Julia dear.
- Yes. Yes, of course.
Oh.
- But he's gone already.
- Who?
Dudley.
- He was here?
- l should have known it.
- Where did he go?
- He said he had so much work to do.
- You must make him take some rest.
- l've been trying to. l can't thank you enough for sending him to me. Do sit down.
My dear, meeting Dudley has been the greatest spiritual experience of my life.
- l'm so glad.
- How did you ever find him, Henry?
- lt was an accident.
- lt was a miracle. lndeed it was. Talking with this wonderful understanding man has...
Henry, l've changed my mind about the cathedral. l'm going to give my money to those who need it.
To the poor and the homeless and the unappreciated people in the city and all over the world.
And l want you to direct the spending of the money.
- You see what Dudley has done?
- Yes, l see.
- Now you understand...
- Thank you, Mrs Hamilton. l'll be home later for dinner or something. l don't know what time...
Goodbye.
- Hello, Professor.
- Henry.
Come in, my dear fellow, come in.
- Sit down. Let me take your coat.
- No, thanks.
Not there. Here.
This is the only reliable chair.
Well, this is a surprise. And an honour.
We must have a glass of sherry.
- No, thanks.
- l insist. l want to show you something.
You see this bottle?
You note that it is full? Now watch. lt's something that even you can't explain with all your vast ecclesiastical knowledge.
You will observe that it is still full.
How do you account for that?
And the sherry itself - it stimulates, it warms, it inspires, but no matter how much you drink, it never inebriates. l think l can account for it.
Dudley's been here.
Yes. And that bottle isn't all.
He told me things about history that opened my eyes.
Today l went up to the university library and looked into some ancient texts which no scholar has been able to decipher.
Suddenly, l found that l could understand them.
And look. This is what l've done thanks to Dudley.
My history. l'm actually writing it.
Let's face it, Henry. This Dudley is no mortal man like the rest of us.
- ls he?
- How did you know?
Well, l can't tell.
Who is he? What is he?
- He says he's an angel.
- An angel?
Nothing stopped me from saying it.
- From heaven?
- That l'm not sure about.
An angel.
Too bad. He's such a nice fellow. l should have known it. Nothing less than an angel could have put me to work. l'm glad he's done some good.
He's brought nothing but disaster for me.
That's absurd. He and Julia were in here the other day and she seemed happier than she's been in years.
Quite like her old delightful self.
She's a different person when she's with him.
He's made her despise me.
Are you sure he has done that?
- You think it's my own fault?
- l didn't say that.
This is a mystery beyond my powers of comprehension. l suppose l am to blame for everything. l asked for this in more ways than one. l suppose that Dudley came to me to confirm that l'd already lost the love of Julia and Debby. l've got a confession to make, old friend.
You sent me a coin - that was generous of you - and l was mean enough only to see its commercial value.
- Now l don't know what's happened to it.
- Well, l do. Here it is.
Now where...? Here it is.
Where did you find it?
Oh, don't tell me.
Yes. And he told me what it is - a museum piece, worth a fortune.
No. l insist you keep it.
Give it to Julia as my Christmas present. lt might bring luck to you both. lt seems strange, you being a bishop and l a broken-down old scholar, but l feel terribly sorry for you. l wish there was something l could do to help.
- Thank you, but there's nothing.
- There must be.
You and Julia love each other.
You always have.
That's only partially true. l love Julia.
- Then fight for her.
- How can l fight against...?
- But you have a tremendous advantage.
- Advantage? Over an angel?
That's precisely it. He's an angel.
Julia is a creature of Earth. She's a woman, Henry, and you are a man. lsn't it beautiful? And he did every bit of it himself and so quick too.
When l saw it, l couldn't believe my eyes.
What a blessing he's been to us.
The tree's lovely, Matilda. Lovely. l'm glad you like it. lt's been years since l've worked on a Christmas tree. l usually get the more disagreeable jobs.
Good night, Matilda.
Sweet dreams.
Thank you, Mr Dudley.
- Julia?
- Yes? l think my work here is almost finished. l'll have to be moving along.
Oh.
Well... Where will you be going, Dudley?
- Wherever they send me.
- Who are ''they''?
My superior officers.
Will we ever see you again?
They seldom send us to the same place twice. We might form attachments. l don't know what you're talking about.
Of course not.
- Julia?
- Yes?
- l don't want to leave.
- Why?
Few people know the secret of making a heaven here on earth.
You are one of those rare people.
- l think you ought to go.
- No. Please, Julia. Don't send me away.
- What are you saying, Dudley?
- l'm tired of being a wanderer. l'm tired of an existence where one is neither hot nor cold, hungry nor full.
No.
No. No, you must go away.
And never come back.
Julia?
Julia! l've never before had to fight an angel, but take off your coat and put up your dukes.
Why do you want to fight me, Henry?
Because you're a thief.
Trying to steal my wife, my child, the love that belongs to me.
Don't you realise that as an angel, l could destroy you with a bolt of lightning? l don't care. Julia means more to me than my life. l'm not going to lose her.
Ah. Then l have news for you. l'm going. l'll accept that as a fact when l see it happen.
You won't. When l'm gone, you will never know that an angel visited your house.
- And Julia, what about her?
- There will be no memory with her either.
Or with Debby or the professor or anyone else.
- l don't trust you, Dudley.
- You may, Henry.
Because your prayer has been answered.
That's not true. l was praying for a cathedral.
No, Henry. You were praying for guidance. That has been given to you.
Just a minute, please.
Goodbye, Henry.
Dudley, if we should need you again, will you come back?
Not l. l should ask to be assigned to the other end of the universe. ls that because l was so difficult?
Oh, no. This difficulty was in me.
When an immortal envies the mortal entrusted to his care, it's a danger signal.
Take her in your arms and hold her tight.
- (heavenly choir)
- Coming.
Kiss her for me, you lucky Henry.
Julia!
Julia.
Shh! She's asleep.
- Are you all right?
- Why, yes, of course l am.
Henry, did you get that for Debby?
No. l can't imagine where it came from.
Why, Henry. What is it? l don't know. l just had the most inexplicable feeling of happiness.
- Oh.
- You know something?
- Downstairs there's a big bowl of cider.
- For tomorrow afternoon.
Let's drink it now. Let's drink to us.
To our happiness and what lies ahead.
Then let's smash the glasses in the fireplace.
- Listen.
- (bell tolls)
That's coming from St Timothy's.
That cider will have to wait if you're going to give your sermon.
- My sermon.
- Yes.
But that's better still.
Tonight, l want to tell you the story of an empty stocking.
Once upon a midnight clear there was a child's cry.
A blazing star hung over a stable and wise men came with birthday gifts.
We haven't forgotten that night down the centuries.
We celebrate it with stars on Christmas trees, with the sound of bells and with gifts - but especially with gifts.
You give me a book. l give you a tie.
Aunt Martha has always wanted an orange squeezer and Uncle Henry could do with a new pipe.
Oh, we forget nobody - adult or child.
All the stockings are filled.
All, that is, except one.
And we have even forgotten to hang it up.
The stocking for the child born in the manger. lt's his birthday we're celebrating.
Don't let us ever forget that.
Let us ask ourselves what he would wish for most and then let each put in his share.
Loving kindness, warm hearts... and a stretched-out hand of tolerance.
All the shining gifts that make peace on earth.
And may this be the fate... of all the witches, warlocks, and sorcerers... who attempt to work their evil magic... within the township limits of Roxford.
The book of exorcism, please.
Mayest thou and thy kind... be condemned forever to eternal flames... never to return to the neighborhood of Roxford.
And now, while we prepare for the extinction... of the father of this witch... the old sorcerer who attempted to come to her aid... there will be a short intermission.
- Popped maize.
Get your fresh Indian popped maize, tuppence a poke.
It's buttered, it's hot, it's fresh.
An anti-witch charm in every poke.
Tuppence, please.
Popped maize. Here we are.
It's buttered, it's fresh.
Popped maize,
Master Wooley?
What has got into thee,
Jonathan?
- What?
- Dost doubt she was a witch?
I should never have accused her if I were not sure.
And her father.
Unquestionably a sorcerer.
Mother, if thou hadst seen what I saw.
We both saw our cows turn pink, then blue... and our sheep dancing a minuet.
- But thou didst not see Jennifer.
- Jennifer?
She told me her name when she chased me into the hayloft.
She was young and beautifully fair — fairer than all women that ever were.
How didst not tell that to the judges?
Because I could never describe her beauty.
What happened in the hayloft, Jonathan?
She brought her golden tresses... close to my face and whispered...
"Jonathan Wooley, thou hast denounced me as a witch.
For that thou shalt be accursed.
Thou and thy children and thy children's children — all will be under the same curse."
What was the curse?
I and all my descendants... will be unhappy in love.
The marriages we make will be disastrous until —
Yes?
- 'Tis too wicked to tell thee, Mother.
- Rubbish!
Thou art in love with Purity Sykes and even betrothed to her.
- Aye, Mother.
- And Purity is a woman among thousands.
Aye, Mother, she is that.
Jonathan, wouldst leave thy future wife sit there all alone?
- What ails him, Mistress Wooley?
- Ah, Purity.
You will find he is a dreamer.
He needs only a firm hand.
Jonathan, I must ask thee to be more attentive.
- In the future —
- Look!
The oak tree.
'Twill be planted over their ashes.
- Why?
- To hold the evil spirits — shh! — prisoner in its roots... thus keeping their wicked powers from surviving.
I hope.
And this is the tree which was planted over their ashes.
The witches' spirits, of course... are imprisoned in its roots.
Imprisoned forever.
Martha...
I have the honor to —
- to —
- Are you proposing to me?
Yes, Martha.
Oh, Nathaniel!
What was that?
Fort Sumter fired upon!
War declared between the states!
Nancy — Nancy, control yourself.
Control yourself.
Drop your hand.
I wish to throw this vase!
Master Wooley, did you hear? War!
Where is the nearest recruitin' office?
Running off to war like a coward!
I'm not talking about the whole house at the moment.
It's that living room!
Estelle!
Now — Now, listen to me!
Estelle!
Estelle.
Estelle, please.
- What?
- Miss Masterson?
Please. Hold it.
One more.
Papa, I'm leaving.
Smile.
Will you try to be more pleasant?
At least until after the wedding.
Fellow members of the Roxford Country Club...
Dr. White's proposing another toast.
I realize that lovebirds... would like to be out on the veranda whispering sweet nothings.
After a certain ceremony tomorrow... they will have all the rest of their lives for billing and cooing.
- Mostly billing.
But if the voters have any sense at all, they will insist... that the first four years of the honeymoon be spent in the governor's mansion!
Go ahead. You might pick up a few more votes.
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
I see getting married... as well as trying to get elected, calls for speeches.
I can truly say... that a new life is beginning for me.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's just a storm.
Ladies and gentlemen... while at the moment, the future seems a little dark —
- You see?
One never knows what the next moment will bring.
Where am I? What's happened?
A miracle! An infernal miracle!
We're free again.
Free at last!
-  Who speaketh?
- 'Tis I, thy father, Daniel.
But thou hast no substance.
Nor hast thou, Jennifer.
We are smoke — witches' smoke.
But our evil spirits have survived.
'Twill be sweet to plague the human race again.
First we'll visit the cornfield and ruin the crop.
'Tis always a good way to limber up.
Look, Father.
The cornfield is no longer there.
Well, we must expect a few changes... in 270 years.
Were our spirits in the wood that long?
Aye. I counted the tree rings.
See? They've built a new house.
It seems all ablaze.
Is it on fire?
Not yet!
What's knittin', kitten?
You like to cut a rug?
Let's ditch these ickies. How about goin' to heaven in your jalopy?
That's solid, Jackson.
Now you're cookin' on the front burner.
What language is that,
Father?
I don't know, but we'll learn it.
See how they dance today.
They stand so close.
Well, well, well.
Things have changed.
I never thought I'd see clothes like that in New England.
These cannot be the descendants... of the Puritans we knew.
There's something that hasn't changed... in 270 years.
Keep thy mind on our business!
'Twould be nice to have lips — lips to whisper lies... lips to kiss a man and make him suffer.
Father, why cannot I have lips and eyes and hair?
- Careful. Someone's coming.
Quick! Do as I do!
These bottles — we'll hide in them.
Quick! Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
Whee!
Are you all right, Jennifer?
'Tis full of bubbles in here. They tickle!
My bottle has the tang of maple rum!
Look, Father!
Come closer, man, so I can see thee better.
Riddle-dee-dee, riddle-dee-doe... get thee hence and stub thy toe.
There was something familiar about that face.
Could we follow him?
- What'll it be, Mr. Wooley?
- The same — bourbon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Wooley.
Wooley!
I knew I recognized those features.
Well, well, well.
A descendant of the man who had us burned.
No wonder he looks so unhappy.
I put a curse upon his family.
Well, I thought lovebirds always flew around in pairs.
Estelle's talking politics.
- What's the matter? Election jitters?
- No.
How can I lose, with Masterson and all his papers in back of me?
My future father-in-law has never backed a loser.
If he spoils his record this time,
I'll have to hock my stethoscope.
You're betting on a sure thing, Dudley.
He isn't missing a trick. Look at that.
Posters at a private party.
The whole marriage is just another campaign stunt to him — insisting we hold it the day before the election... so I'll get a good publicity break on election day.
Wallace, I think you've had enough to drink.
- Now, Estelle —
- I'd like to go home.
Yes, dear.
Can we drop you, Dudley?
Yes, thanks.
The curse is working.
She has the look of a shrew!
Here, Tom.
Jennifer, what's that curse thou wast chattering about?
Each Wooley must marry the wrong woman.
Ha! What a curse!
Every man who marries... marries the wrong woman.
True suffering cometh... when a man is in love with the woman he cannot marry.
Father, suppose a man were in love with a witch.
With me.
I would not marry him.
Ha!
Ooh, pardon me.
I need air. d For tonight
I'll merry, merry be d d Tomorrow I'll be sober dd
Let's get out of here.
Let's go for a little ride.
Broom!
Father, give me a body.
Oh, no.
Thou didst get into enough trouble with thy last one.
Thou canst not give me a body.
Thou wouldst not even know how to begin.
No? I'd merely make a little fire.
As thy last body was destroyed by flame... thy new one would be born in flame!
Prove it.
Start that great house on fire.
A hotel for pilgrims.
'Twould be a pleasure burning that.
All right, i will.
Worra, worra, fizzle, dizzle... let the flame begin to sizzle!
P-I-L-G-R-I-M...
H-O-T-E-L!
- Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye, Jennifer.
Be a bad girl.
- That's the Pilgrim Hotel!
- It would have to be on our way home.
- We'll have to stop.
You wouldn't go through fire for your future wife?
Boy, look at those flames.
I never saw such a fire.
- Is there any way we can get through?
- Sorry, Mr. Wooley. It's all blocked off.
- Some firebug must've touched this off.
- He did a good job!
This is the craziest fire
I've ever seen!
Laps up water like a cat!
- You're sure everybody got out?
- Yes, sir. We've checked every room.
Yeah, they're all accounted for.
It's all right, men. Everybody's safe.
Get these people back.
We're stuck here for a while.
Tell them who you are.
They'll have to make way.
- I'm sorry, Estelle.
- Wallace, where are you going?
- There's Mr. Wooley!
- Make way for Wooley.
- Make way for the next governor.
- Would you like to go through?
- Yes, thank you.
Folks, let him get by.
- I'm voting for you.
- There goes a great guy.
- Hello, Mr. Wooley.
- Hello.
Don't get too close.
I got a bet riding on you.
- How did it happen?
- Nobody seems to know.
There was an explosion on the roof.
The top floor went like that.
Then the fifth, then the fourth.
Now it's on the third. Soon it'll be on the second, and then the first... then it'll all cave in on the basement.
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's fully insured... and I love building new things.
I want to build it in a classic gothic design.
- Don't you love gothic? Huh?
- Quiet.
What was that?
Did you hear that voice?
Somebody's inside.
Listen!
I didn't hear anything.
It was so clear!
A woman's voice.
Aw, there's nobody in there.
They've looked everywhere.
No, wait. Wait.
There it is again!
Here i am, Mr. Wooley.
- Over here.
- Where?
I-I can't see!
Just walk.
You'll find me.
Keep walking.
This way. This way.
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
Two legs, two arms, a face, hair.
- Yes, I seem to be complete.
- Why don't you come out? i've been waiting for you,
Mr. Wooley.
- Where are you?
- You're getting warmer.
Here's my hand.
How can I get you out?
I can't see a thing.
I can see you.
How do you do?
Never mind.
Let's get out of here!
- Have you a gazing glass?
- A what?
A mirror.
I want to see what I look like.
- At a time like this?
- Oh, I'm cold.
- Cold? In this furnace?
- But I have no clothes.
No clothes?
Here, put this on.
How did you get here?
From the top floor.
Why do you look away?
Am I not pretty?
Who cares? Come on.
- Get up, get up!
I can't!
Here, I'll carry you.
Legs are funny when you're not used to them, aren't they?
- Huh?
- Why are you in such a hurry?
Why? The whole building was on the third floor, and now it's fallen to the second.
When this ceiling gives way, we'll be buried alive.
Nothing will happen to us.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, I do.
Ah! Here's a door!
Here!
- Oh!
- Oh!
This way's blocked.
The bars on the window.
Quick —
- Where are you?
- I've found a better coat.
And a mirror!
Mm, not bad.
Oh, I'm a blond.
Would you rather
I be a brunette?
If you don't get out of this fire, you'll be a redhead!
Don't you realize —
That was the second floor.
Well, there's no way out.
We're goners, little girl.
Perhaps I should be little.
I'm just as high as your heart.
Did you hear what I said?
We're trapped.
Just we two.
Look, before I got here... what — what hit you on the head?
I felt nothing until your hand touched mine.
Oh, I see.
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, would you like to leave now?
It would be a pleasure... but that door is now a wall.
Oh. Then we can use the one behind the screen.
- Quick! It's our only chance!
- I want to fix my hair.
Come on, while you still have a head!
Do you like blonds?
May I get a picture?
Hold it right there.
He saved somebody!
Stand back, people.
- Are you all right?
- I guess so.
- You certainly gave me a scare.
- Wally...
- take me away from these people.
- Here, Dudley.
She's suffering from shock.
Well, uh guess I'd better take you to a hospital.
Oh, well,
I hope she's all right.
It's only natural for you to be concerned.
Estelle, I've told you a dozen times.
There's no point in — Well?
It's amazing.
Not a scratch on her. Not a burn.
- You must be relieved.
- You've known me all my life.
She never met Wally.
The girl's suffering from delusions.
You see?
She has delusions.
- Well, I haven't!
- Estelle, you must believe me!
- Listen to me.
- I've never seen her before... and I —
I'll never see her again!
- Dear, you ought —
- It's silly to drive me home and then back here.
- You need rest.
- Darling —
I know best. You have to get used to pleasing me sometimes.
- All right, dear.
- Ooh, you still smell of smoke.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
Susie, you know you can't come in until breakfast time.
- Scat!
Scat!
Susie! Susie!
Susie?
Susie, where are you?
Hello, darling.
- I thought you'd never get rid of that girl.
- What are you doing here?
Waiting for you.
- But the hospital, the —
- I didn't like it there.
How did you get here?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
What am I to do with you?
Just look on me as an old friend of the family.
- I never laid eyes on you before.
- Come here, Wally.
Am I not an attractive female?
- What's that got to do with your being here?
- Am I?
Yes, yes, you're very pretty.
- Take my hand again.
- Now, come. I know you've had a terrible experience.
And now a pleasant one.
You... have a very nice hand.
And now it can shake mine good night.
- Your hand is cold.
- Well, so is yours.
Yes, good-good night.
Let mine rest in yours a moment.
See?
It's growing warmer.
Well, that's fine.
That's fi—
- Amusing-looking chap, isn't he?
- Yes.
- Ancestor of mine.
- I'm aware he is.
Jonathan Wooley.
He would have been more hospitable.
Oh, I don't think so.
Well, I have a busy day tomorrow.
It's time for beddy-bye.
- Mm, take my hand again.
- You're becoming a problem.
- Am I?
- Yes, and that is not the solution.
See, it isn't respectable for you to be sitting in a stranger's house.
- I like your resisting me.
- Oh, you do?
- You know what I'm going to do with you now?
- Yes.
Just, uh, get up, please.
- Where are you taking me, Wally?
- We're going out.
Night, Jonathan!
I'm going to give you money, and you can go back wherever you came from.
- No, not yet.
- Yes, right now!
Ooh, this is a lovely sensation.
Even nicer than flying.
- What's going on, Governor?
- Not "Governor" yet, Fred.
She was in a fire and lost her clothes.
No, I didn't.
I didn't have any.
- Evening, Mr. Wooley.
- Have you any money, Joe?
About eight bucks.
Well, I only have ten, but here.
Give it all to her and take her anyplace she wants to go.
I'll pay you tomorrow.
For heaven's sake, be good.
What'll I do with the coat?
When you're through with it, send it to the police.
It-It didn't belong to her.
[ Nervous Chuckle ]
I hope that cab is heated.
Where to, lady?
Where to?
Oh.
Hope I didn't butt in on a pleasant dream.
Just wanted to make sure you're all right.
- You've certainly earned a drink.
- I'll say I have.
Upstairs you go. Get a good night's sleep. I'll take this.
- Dudley, she was here!
- Who was here?
The girl
I saved in the fire.
That's impossible.
When I left her in the hospital, she was sleeping like an angel.
Well, that's some hospital.
She got away. And some angel.
Now, wait a minute, hmm?
Tell me this again slowly.
No, tomorrow.
I've had enough for one day.
How about me?
I've got $1 0,000 tied up in this election.
If this gets out, you're a dead goose.
Think of the scandal — the night before your wedding.
That's it — the election!
That girl was sent here by the opposition.
- They're trying to frame me.
- You're right.
Rainfogle and that bunch wouldn't stop at anything. Did anybody see her?
- Nobody who'll do any talking.
- Good. I'll put her down as an amnesia case.
Give the police a description.
Was she wearing that fur coat?
Maybe you'd better not say anything to the police.
Everything's all right now.
I got rid of her.
Well, try and forget her, then.
You want a pill to make you sleep?
No. No, thanks.
I'm much calmer now.
Oh, make sure the door locks.
Okay. Relax, now.
- Good night, Wally.
Now close this door, Wally.
I said close this door, Wally.
Now come here.
I'm coming.
My pajamas.
I don't want to call the police, but I know your whole scheme.
- You do?
- And I know who's behind it all.
- You don't.
- Want me to mention names?
- What names?
- County Chairman
Martin J. Rainfogle.
- That's a nice name.
- Want another?
- Mm-hmm.
- State Senator Conrad O'Hara Jr.
Sheriff Peter L. Glasshauser and all his ward heelers.
- How much are they paying you?
- Nothing.
Ha! Hmm?
You're just doing it for love, hmm?
Yes. Father thought it'd be a good idea.
- Who is your father?
- You've never met him.
But he doesn't want this state to have a good administration.
Father doesn't want any state to have a good administration.
- But he's out to get me particularly.
- Yes.
I am a pretty good judge of character... and I don't think you're really a bad girl.
- Don't you?
- You're very young.
I'm older than you'd guess.
I don't think you ought to go back to that father.
I'd rather stay with you.
You would?
You really would, wouldn't you?
Now I understand.
Just because I was of some slight help... in getting you out of that blazing inferno... perhaps you are, momentarily, infatuated with me.
But it isn't love.
And I'm not in love with you.
I guess this'll take longer than I planned.
I'm afraid you have rather a romantic mind.
You see, love isn't just a matter of... two people meeting under romantic circumstances.
Love — that is, love that is really worthwhile — grows slowly.
Real love is... like a painting.
Ah, yes.
Yes, there have been thousands and thousands... of couples just like us... going their separate ways... never realizing the other was waiting somewhere.
Why, Romeo and Juliet knew right away.
That's what Shakespeare's trying to tell us.
Of course, the case of Dante and Beatrice... is a trifle different.
He saw her only once.
But in that moment, the whole world... was bathed in a new light.
It wasn't just a humdrum world anymore, where you had to... get up in the morning and meet a lot of stupid people.
- Who's that?
-  8:00, Mr. Wooley.
- What?
- That's impossible.
But... it's true!
- Good morning, Wally.
- Good morning, Jennifer.
It's fantastic.
It just seems like a few minutes since I came in.
Don't you want your breakfast?
You're as bad as when you were a little boy.
Even on a day like this, I have to call you half a dozen times.
Oh, and what a — what a beautiful day it is too.
Happy is the bride that the sun... shines on.
Good morning.
Mmm!
That smells good!
You don't know how long it's been since I've eaten.
- Mr. Wooley —
- I'll explain later, Margaret.
- What can you possibly say?
- Well, you —
No, no, dear.
Not like that.
First you butter them, hmm?
And then a little syrup.
Mr. Wooley, I've worked for your family for 30 years... been almost a mother to you... and to think that on this day, of all days —
Oh, yes, and send up some evening gowns too, please.
You see, everything the young lady had was burned.
Send them up right away, please.
Thank you.
You know, I think you've broken my record for waffles.
Well, Margaret likes nothing better than to make them.
Those people are still downstairs waiting.
Margaret, these have made a great hit with her.
- What did you say?
- Those people.
I told you they were here three batches of waffles ago.
You did?
I don't remember.
Uh, people waiting?
Who? Who are they?
- You'll find out.
- Excuse me.
Mm, more waffles?
There's no more batter.
Oh! I'm sorry, Margaret.
- Better be sorry for yourself.
- Huh?
It's Miss Masterson downstairs, with her father.
Who?
Miss Masterson, the lady you're getting married to.
Oh!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I'd forgotten you were going to drop in.
We didn't say we were.
What's the matter with you?
Have you seen the papers?
I've got you all over the front page.
That's great.
Dear, hadn't you better go?
- It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
- Don't be ridiculous.
Saving that girl was the luckiest break.
You don't know what that can do for you.
I have a rough idea.
I've arranged a special broadcast about the fire. You're to be interviewed.
- I'll have you back by 1 1 :00.
- That's fine.
That gives me plenty of time.
Shall we go?
No, I'm going to stay here.
I want to see about brightening up this antique shop.
- The photographers will be here.
- There's no time.
- Run along.
- I'm a little on edge, with the wedding at noon.
I'd feel much better if you came along.
There.
That's a good girl.
Excuse me.
I'll get my hat.
[ Estelle Shrieks ]
- How did that happen?
- it just slammed shut.
I'm terribly sorry.
There's rather a heavy draft... blowing through the house today.
What's he going out with her for?
Why shouldn't he?
He's going to marry her in less than two hours.
- As for you, young woman —
- Oh, go to sleep.
After all my work!
No, I don't want to go.
Two hours.
That doesn't give me much time.
I wish Father were here.
What seems to be the trouble?
Oh, good morning, Father.
I need some advice.
He's tougher than I thought.
I can't seem to make him love me.
Thou art the veriest bungler.
I must have been drunk to give thee a body.
Oh, don't smoke so much, Father.
- Did something go wrong with thy philter?
- My what?
Thy love philter.
Thou gavest him one, I presume.
No. I thought I could do it barehanded.
Art thou a witch or a woman?
Prepare a love philter at once.
Dost thou recall the incantation? Listen. dd [ Simple Melody ] d Kettle, kettle on the hob d d Hurry up and do thy job d
[ Daniel ] d Steam and hiss and while you do d d Cook an all-compelling brew d d So that he who sips will be d d Slave to love's captivity dd
Now put in a cool place until ready.
- What will it taste like, Father?
- Like cool water... but 'twill set
Master Wooley's blood on fire.
Then I'll treat him like a slave.
I'll make him suffer, body and soul.
Speaking of bodies,
I have a notion to make a personal appearance myself.
Of course, I'll have to burn a house down to do it.
Not this one, Father.
I've a better idea: the building he's in now.
- 'Twill force him back to me.
- Excellent!
Good hunting, Jennifer.
'Tis growing cool.
Now we shall see if thou canst resist me.
Get ready, Master Wooley.
- Not dressed yet?
- I'm lucky to be alive.
What's happened now?
I was making a broadcast about the fire, and suddenly
I was in another one.
- Mysterious explosion on the roof.
- Anybody hurt?
No, we all got out all right.
What's wrong with this door?
Margaret!
What are you two doing in my bedroom?
What happened?
Oh, I —
I must have dozed off.
Go upstairs and get dressed.
Where's the brandy?
- Did you get rid of that girl?
- "That girl"?
Oh! She must still be here.
Well, she won't be here for long.
Ah, you listen to me, young lady.
Come on, come on.
Get up.
I'm listening, Mr. Wooley.
Why do you look at me that way?
Oh... my dress.
Do you like it?
I — I don't know.
It's such a shock to see you dressed.
I mean...
- you're beautiful.
- Enough to make a man fall in love?
Mere physical beauty isn't everything.
That's what I thought.
-  Look, Jennifer —
- I don't like the tone of your voice.
I swallowed some smoke last night, and I just swallowed more now.
- But that's not going to stop me —
- Wally wants a drink of water.
Nice, cool water.
Thank you.
Now, all I have to say —
Drink it, Wally... and then I'll be glad to hear anything you have to say.
You'll find out that no one named Wooley... is able to stay away from me.
Oh, i'm awfully sorry.
This is terrible.
Jennifer! Jennifer!
Can you hear me?
Dudley! Come here!
Oh, you —
Here, here. Drink this.
There.
There, that's better.
Now, how do you feel?
I — I feel strange.
- Hmm?
- What happened?
Well, the picture fell.
Does your head hurt?
- My head?
- Mm.
No.
It's my heart.
- It feels so light.
- Try not to talk.
Oh, but I must.
I must tell you how I feel.
Oh, Wally, you're so beautiful.
Dudley!
- Take my hand.
- Don't start that again.
Oh, my darling.
Let that man alone!
Dudley, something really happened to her this time.
- She got a sock on the head.
That picture —
- You did it in self-defense.
Aren't you glad you drank it, Wally?
- I didn't drink anything.
- What's she talking about?
A drink of water. I gave it to her when she was coming to.
You gave it to me?
Never force liquids on a person who's unconscious.
It may have serious consequences.
- Nervous reactions.
- Come on. We're late.
- What are we going to do?
- Lock her in this room.
- But, Dudley —
Come on, before she marries you.
Stop worrying.
She can't get out.
I'll drive.
You're too nervous.
You'll have to get rid of her after the wedding.
Poor little girl.
All alone in the world... except for a no-good father.
Don't ever jam your brakes on like that!
I didn't jam them.
It just stopped.
- I can't figure it out.
- What's that smoke?
- What happened to him?
- Who?
The fellow we pulled out of the fire. He's gone!
How do you like my body, Jennifer?
Not too old, not too young.
I'm sorry I've forgotten the formula for clothing.
I had to borrow this sheet from the ambulance.
By the by, has the potion been administered?
Yes.
Father, something went wrong with our plan.
What?
But that love philter never fails.
It didn't.
But... I drank it.
Nicodemus!
Then you love him!
Yes, Father.
But he's about to marry someone else... because of my ancient curse on the Wooleys.
Do you think if I explained it all to him —
By all means do.
Telling a mortal you're a witch will only mean the end of you.
Then what shall I do?
He must not marry her.
You won't let him, will you?
- Let me think.
- You could make him love me.
You can do anything you want.
Yes.
This problem should be fairly simple.
- Just leave it all to me.
- Oh, thank you, Father!
- Will you leave it to me?
- i promise.
Splendid.
[ Chuckles ] I'm still a little bit warm from the fire.
Jennifer, fetch me a pair of Master Wooley's breeches.
We're going to his wedding. d I love you truly d d Truly d d Dear d d Life with its sorrows d d Life with d d Its tears dd
Here, drink this.
- What is it?
- Novocain. 1 20 proof.
- Down fast, brother.
- If that girl ever gets out of my house —
Drink that.
Suppose she comes here?
It'll be terrible for Estelle.
Oh, you'll be all right, and I'll be sitting pretty.
- dd [ Instrumental Interlude ]
- There's your cue.
Just play
"I'm a seeing-eye dog" now.
- Can't you smile?
- You know I wanted a church wedding.
You've had everything else your own way.
I should never have given in to Wallace. It's the last time.
She's not here.
Stop worrying. dd [ "Bridal March" ]
Smile.
- [ Wind Gusting ]
- [ Women Screaming ]
[ All Clamoring ]
Close that door!
It's a hurricane!
- My veil is ruined!
- Go back and wait.
I'm terribly sorry.
There'll be a short delay till we get everything straightened out.
Music, music!
Sing something. d I love you truly d
That's all I needed: a hurricane on my wedding day.
Never mind about that.
She just blew in!
- What?
- I saw her in the doorway.
- What'll I do?
- I'll think of something.
Beloved, this is my father.
Delighted, Master Wooley.
You've made a mistake.
This is a private room.
It's rather crowded downstairs, and a bit windy. [ Chuckles ]
Be seated, Master Wooley.
I should like to have a talk with you.
Look here. I'm being married in two minutes.
- I understand those were your plans.
- "Were?" He is. Nothing you can do —
- Would you excuse us?
- Maybe you'd better.
Hurry up.
I'll stand guard.
Let me fix your pretty tie.
You see, Father?
He's just like a Greek god.
My little one tells me she was your overnight guest.
- Not at my invitation.
- Oh, no, Father.
The poor sweet didn't want me to stay.
Were I an ordinary man,
Master Wooley... a horsewhipping would no doubt be in order.
But I am not an ordinary man.
While examining your dwelling...
- I came upon... this.
- My revolver!
You can't force me to marry her.
What a banal mind you have.
You may hold the weapon.
- What is this?
- It's very simple.
Here is a bruised flower.
I am her father.
That is your revolver.
You are going to shoot me.
I... am going to shoot you?
Will that be of help?
Now, now.
Father knows best.
Warm, Master Wooley?
You don't know what warmth is.
I am told one of your forebears made a hobby of bonfires.
What a pity he cannot be here... to see his descendant burn.
Yes, Master Wooley.
Burn.
In the modern way.
Strapped in a chair... heated by electricity.
I anticipated that.
Pistol, pistol, let there be... murder in the first degree.
Thank you so much.
Amusing invention, the electric chair.
[ Chuckles ]
What will they think of... next?
- What's happened?
- Uh —
- It was an accident!
- 'Twas no accident.
He killed me in cold blood.
Kindly notify the authorities.
Oh, he's frightened you.
He told me he'd help me.
- [ Wallace ] How is he?
- He's dead.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
"Doesn't matter"?
Her own father!
Oh, but that's not my father.
That's just a body he picked up.
I didn't do it, Dudley!
You'll be my witness!
All right.
Well, I wasn't here!
[ Groaning ] dd [ Instrumental Interlude ]
He's as nervous as a bride.
One might think they were going to hang him.
It's up to you.
Now, tell them.
What have I got to do with it?
You're handling the... details of the wedding. dd [ "Bridal March" ]
[ Gasping, Clamoring ] d I love you truly d d Truly d
Empty! I thought
I saw smoke come out.
I know you're here somewhere.
How could you, Father?
You know I love him!

Well, you're not going to.
- [ Woman Shrieks ]
- [ Wallace Gasps ]
Wally!
Don't go upstairs!
- But maybe she killed herself.
- Now, Wally — Wally —
- What's wrong with him?
- I think we'd better call the police.
- What's he done?
- It's the other fellow.
- What other fellow?
- The one in the chair.
Keep calm. I'll be right back.

- Estelle! Estelle! d Ah, love, 'tis something d d To feel d
Now, you get back in that body.
No. I didn't like it.
It's an old, fat body.
Then I'll tell Wally what we are.
Knowing what would then happen to you?
- Yes.
- Heh. You wouldn't dare.
Wouldn't I?
You're all right?
[ Jennifer ] Wally, darling, there's something i must tell you.
[ Gasps ]
Look!
- I thought you said he was dead!
- Well, he is!
[ Drunkenly ]
A fine way to take advantage... of a father's affection.
Now hearken to a father's curse.
I'm going to turn you into a frog.
Frog, frog, sitting on a log —
What's the next line?
You wait till I sober up.
You'll be sorry.
[ Woman Gasps ] d For tonight
I'll merry, merry be d d Tomorrow I'll be sober dd
- What did you want the police for?
- It's all right now.
He fell out the window.
- He what?
- Not Wally. The other fellow.
- Unhand me, foul minions of the law!
- Take it easy, Pop.
I'm going to cast a spell upon you.
From now on, you're a rat!
Rat, rat, fatter than the cat —
- How does the rest of it go?
- So I'm a rat, huh?
- Call the wagon.
- Come on.
If I could only remember the words...
I could turn you into kangaroos.
They're taking him away.
Why didn't I have them take you too?
Perhaps because you're beginning to love me.
- Please don't start that again.
- Wally!
I thought Father would be friendly.
I wouldn't let him or anyone else harm you.
- Oh, I know you wouldn't.
- But it's true!
Last night I was your enemy, but now I've changed.
I love you.
I'll always love you.
- If I could die,
I would do that for you.
- Will you just be a sweet girl?
- Hey, they're ready.
- Good-bye.
- Where are you going?
- I told you before —
But I thought that now, after all I've done for you —
You've been very obliging, but now
I'm going downstairs to be married.
That's what you think. dd [ Instrumental Interlude ]
[ Jennifer Screams ]
Wally!
You gotta go through with it this time.
I'll take care of her. dd [ "Bridal March" ]
Hurry up, hurry up.
Let's get this over with.
He'll pay for this.
- Do I look all right?
- Who cares? Go on.
Well, what are you standing there for?
Dudley has the ring.
I'll see what's keeping him.
- Wallace.
- You come back here!
What's the matter with you?
Did you ever have one of those days when nothing seems to go right?
Wallace! d i love you truly d
- Got here too late.
- Dudley.
She really did love me.
She said she'd die for me.
- Oh, my darling.
- At last!
[ Surprised Gasp ]
I've had enough of this!
Estelle, wait a minute!
Listen to me!
You've got to listen to me!
Uh — [ Nervous Chuckle ]
It's a big misunderstanding.
If you'll give me a few minutes, I —
I'll give you just ten seconds to get out of this house, all of you!
We won't be here that long.
- You'd better get out of the state.
- I'm terribly —
- Get out!
- I can explain.
Uh, after the fire, you see, she spent the ni-night —
On-On second thought...
- maybe we'd better just go, darling.
- Mr. Masterson —
I'll expose you in every paper I own!
This'll not only cost you the election, but I'll encourage the voters of this state to tear you limb from limb!
I'll head the tar-and-feather party personally!
When I'm through with you, you'll wish you'd never been born. d I love you truly d
- Will you shut up?

[ Man ] Extra! Big Wooley scandal!
Read all about it!
Extra! Paper!
Big Wooley scandal!
Extra! Read all about it!
Wallace Wooley exposed!
Extra! Paper!
- Big Wooley scandal!
- What does it say?
It's just as I thought.
He's finished.
And I'm bankrupt.
Go and get her, I say.
Bring my daughter to me.
Bring her here or, by Jezebel —
- Shut up!
- Quiet!
- I wanna get some sleep!
- Hey, toss this stub bug out of here!
For the last time, will you pipe down?
I tell you, my daughter ran off with a bumpkin... named Wooley,
Wallace Wooley.
Sure, she did. You take it easy.
You'll be out of here tomorrow.
Tomorrow may be too late!
There's no telling what she'll do.
I know a couple of ways to make you shut up.
And I know a hundred ways... to silence you forever.
Oh, but I don't remember them now.
This is terrible!
She'll marry him.
Wallace Wooley's gonna marry his daughter.
Yeah?
And then you'll see what'll happen to Master Wooley.
I'll wreak my vengeance on them both.
She thinks she can run away from me... that I cannot see her because of the fog.
But I can see you, Jennifer.
She smiles.
She presses closer to him.
Darling?
Yes, Wally?
You're guessing about those mileposts, aren't you?
No, I can see them.
I have rather unusual eyes.
If we're really over the state line,
I can relax.
Wally, what color would those feathers be?
"Feathers"?
Oh, I don't know.
But the tar would be black.
Let's stop, Wally.
I guess we'll have to.
I can't even see the front of the car.
Mighty nice scenery they have around here.
- Lovely, isn't it?
- We'd better walk to the next town.
No, I thought we'd stay here.
Here? We're in the middle of nowhere.
How do you know,
Mr. Wooley?
Good evening.
If you're looking for a place to stay,
I have a lovely room.
Thank you.
- Do you have two rooms?
- No, i'm sorry.
Aren't you married?
You're dressed for a wedding.
Where's the nearest justice of the peace?
He'll be down in a minute.
Henry? Customers.
Uh, let's see.
One dollar for waking up the county clerk... and helping you get your license.
Two dollars for the ceremony.
One-fifty for lodgings.
Rent of my pajamas,
25 cents.
Rent of nightgown —
I'll have to charge you
50 cents for that.
- It's sort of an heirloom.
- Yeah.
There.
Almost a perfect fit.
My grandmother was just a little bit of a thing like you.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, shall I light the fire?
Oh, no.
I'd like to try.
I must start learning to be a good housewife.
Let's see. You... just go like that, don't you?
Of course.
They're like any other matches.
Well, good night, my dear.
I'm sure you're going to be very happy.
He's a fine young man... and I hope your boys take after him.
And I hope your girls take after you.
- By Rhadamanthus, on, fire!
- [ Door Opens ]
[ Gasps ]
- Wally?
- Yes, dear?
- Did you see the way that fire came on?
- What fire?
All I can see in this room is you.
- Darling?
- Mm-hmm?
- Do you want to have children?
- Why, of course.
I'd like three little girls exactly like you.
- Ohh!
- Huh?
I think I'd better tell you.
You'd never forgive me if you found out later.
- Aha! A confession!
- Yes, Wally.
I haven't exactly been a saint myself.
We'll compare notes in the morning.
No, I must tell you now.
I don't know how to begin.
Then don't.
- Wally?
- Hmm?
Doesn't it seem strange to you, the way we met?
It's all been like a dream.
- It was witchcraft.
- That's it. Of course.
- You see, Wally —
- Shh, dear.
It's getting late.
But I want you to know what I am.
All right.
All right, what are you?
I'm a witch.
A witch? [ Chuckles ]
I knew it all the time.
- You did?
- Of course.
I've been under your spell since the moment I met you.
Then... it doesn't matter?
You don't mind being married to a witch?
I love it.
I'll try so hard to be a good wife, and I'll only use witchcraft to help you.
What could you do, for instance?
I could make you win the election tomorrow.
Oh, it would take witchcraft to do that.
- I think I can manage it.
- Fine, fine.
After all, I'm not just an ordinary witch.
My family dates back to the days of Pompeii.
- Were you mixed up in that?
- My father was.
Ever hear of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire?
That was our crowd.
You're marvelous.
Seriously, dear... do you like to sleep on the left or the right?
You don't believe me.
Wally, try to understand.
270 years ago —
That's too long a story, dear.
Can't it keep till tomorrow?
Wally, 270 years ago —
- You're not listening to me.
- Yes, dear. Yes, I am.
270 years ago —
I'll tell you tomorrow.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Oh, why can't I remember... the formula for dissolving iron?
- Let me out!
- Quiet!
- Pipe down!
- I couldn't get any shut-eye all night.
- Ah, throw him into solitary!
- Yeah.
That's Wallace Wooley.
Don't tell me they're tossing him in the clink.
It looks that way.
Pay up, brother.
They ain't electing no con for governor.
Bensinger's a cinch.
Why couldn't you keep straight until after you was elected, like everybody else does?
I'd like to talk to you about Jennifer.
We were married last night.
Yes, I know.
Congratulations,
Master Wooley.
Thank you. She's been saying the oddest things... last night and again this morning.
What?
Silly things... about living in Roxford
270 years ago, and, uh — and being a witch.
Beelzebub!
Don't you think I know?
Oh, then she's acted that way before?
Well, maybe
I can help her.
Silence!
I must concentrate.
Iron, iron, melt away —
Oh!
I can't remember a thing.
What is the matter with me?
I'm afraid you've got a hangover.
Don't tell me what I've got!
I invented the hangover!
It was in 1 892 BC.
Did you believe her?
That's the important thing.
"Believe her"? Why, the things she said didn't make any sense.
Then there's still hope.
At first I thought she was joking, but she keeps talking about the election... saying she'll make me win by witchcraft... and that that'll prove she's a witch.
Master Wooley, see if you can get me out of here.
I know how to handle her.
Thanks.
I'll do my best... but I'm afraid I haven't much influence in this town anymore.
- It'll be a Bensinger landslide!
- Quiet!
Three cheers for Wallace Wooley! Hurray!
[ Several Men ]
Hurray! Hurray!
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
- Quiet!
[ Men Continue Chanting ]
We want Wooley!
Hey, hey. I thought you wanted Bensinger.
- I changed my mind.
- Yeah, but you're bettin' on Bensinger.
All right, so I'll lose.
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
Quiet! Quiet!
We want Wooley!
Wallace Wooley is a fraud!
An impostor!
A hypocritical demagogue!
That's why I'm asking you to vote for...
Wallace Wooley.
- Mr. Masterson —
- One moment, please. Yes?
You said,
"Vote for Wooley."
Did I?
Correction, ladies and gentlemen.
The man I am backing is Bensinger.
W-O-O-L-E-Y!
We want Wooley! We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley!
We want Wooley.
- We want Wooley!
- We want Wooley!
We want Wooley! We want Wooley!
[ Cheering, Chanting Continue ]
We want Wooley!
[ Man On Radio ]
That includes every precinct in Kearsarge County, folks.
It looks as if the whole state's gonna make it a Wooley landslide.
More in a minute.
- I can't believe it.
- That's just what she'd said she'd do.
- There's no other explanation.
- You mean she's a —
You see why I couldn't go down to campaign headquarters tonight?
- If this gets out —
- Let's look at these
Wappasocket figures.
- They're not complete.
- You can't be carrying Wappasocket
County. That's Bensinger's home.
Another bulletin, folks:
Complete returns from Wappasocket... show the entire county has climbed on the Wooley bandwagon.
- Well? Are you convinced?
- He must mean another county.
Hold everything.
Here's a flash, folks.
At 1 0:45 tonight, with only three precincts yet to be heard from... election returns were as follows:
Wallace Wooley — 2,684,922.
Elwood Bensinger — none.
He didn't even vote for himself.
Dudley, I've married a witch.
What am I going to do?
Let me look at you.
Did you say she's 800,000 years old?
No, no, no, no, no.
That's her father. She's only 290.
- I see.
- But you'd never think it.
Well, marriage does a lot for people.
Well, Wally, this clears everything up.
All except one little point:
How did she get out of the hospital that night?
- She used a broom.
- Oh, of course!
I must be getting stupid.
A child would know that.
Dudley, what — what am I going to do?
- How many people have you told?
- No one but you. How can I?
I see your point.
People are so skeptical.
Might be hard to grasp that the first lady is a witch.
- I don't care about them.
What about me?
- Look out!
Are you satisfied, darling?
You're the new governor.
- What are you going to do now?
- Help you with your slippers.
- No, not just yet.
- Then I'll warm them by the fire.
You know, I lighted it with a match, Wally.
From now on, I'm going to be just a simple, helpful wife.
Dudley, I can't take it.
"A helpful wife."
What if she runs me for president?
- What's that?
People gathering in the street.
They want you to make a speech.
- Real people?
- Naturally. They all voted for Wally.
- What am I gonna say to them?
- I don't know.
There are one or two things
I wouldn't tell them. Good night.
- Where are you going?
- I've gotta be getting home — into my straightjacket!
- Would you like me to drive you?
- No, thanks. I'll call a broom —
I mean, a taxi.
- Wally, darling.
- Yes, dear?
You don't mind my being a witch, do you?
Well, you'll admit it's a little unusual.
- No one need ever know.
- We'll talk about that later, dear.
It'll be our little secret.
Our little secret?
Now go out and make your speech to them, dear.
Good evening, my dear.
- Three cheers for Wallace Wooley!
Hurray!
I must compliment you on the public confidence... you have inspired for Master Wooley.
- You're not going to hurt him again?
- I will attend to him later.
I am concerned now with an erring daughter.
I've done nothing except love him.
You have informed him that you are a witch.
Need I remind you of the punishment... that I must perforce administer?
At midnight, back to the tree!
There to stay until the present race of men is extinguished.
A rather light sentence, considering the offense.
But if I don't wish to go —
- There is nothing you can do about it.
- I'm still a witch.
No, my dear. Your heart is so full of human love... that I can no longer trust you.
Until you have resumed a more spirit-like existence... you shall be a mere mortal!
I've remembered all the spells you've taught me.
Out, fire, by Rhadamanthus!
- Out!
You see?
Your power is dead.
Mine remains.
Out, fire.
Better get ready.
Soonest done, soonest mended... and midnight approaches.
May I... say good-bye?
Certainly, my dear.
I'll be around.
...endeavor to give this fair state an honest administration.
As a former governor so aptly put it —
Wally! Wally!
Uh, and in conclusion, thank you very much.
What is it?
- You must help me!
- You want me to help you?
- Come on, darling. Hurry!
- No, no. But where?
- Anywhere.
Out the back door. Hurry up.
Anyplace, Joe.
Just drive around.
Hey!
That's my cab!
- What is all this?
- I had to get you away.
Something might have happened to you.
- What?
- I don't know, but something awful.
- Can't you tell me about it now?
- Wally, I'm afraid!
You are afraid.
What trouble can you be in that you can't get out of by witchcraft?
- I've lost my power.
- What?
I'm not a witch any longer.
I'm like any other girl.
I wish we could go so fast that no power on earth could overtake us!
- Faster!
- Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around.
You are like any other girl — afraid of lightning.
That isn't ordinary lightning.
- Can't he go any faster?
- Step on it, Joe.
Faster.
Nobody could possibly catch us.
Joe's a wonderful driver.
There's nothing he can't do with the car.
They've certainly improved this road.
Is it midnight yet?
No.
Five minutes to 1 2:00.
Don't look!
[ Daniel ]
Back to the tree!
[ Daniel Cackling ]
Don't worry about me,
Master Wooley.
I am accustomed to fire.
Come, Jennifer.
I have decided to return with thee to the tree.
I am weary of mortals.
There's no use fighting.
It has to be like this.
- Jennifer, what are you saying?
- Go, Wally. Please.
Midnight.
Good-bye, my darling.
I want you to remember me as I was: just an ordinary girl.
-  He'll remember.
That will be his torture.
And I'll remember that I loved you.
Through all eternity
I'll remember.
[ Cackles ]
Thou wilt remember nothing of this tender feeling.
That will be the essence of thy punishment.
I'll never forget.
With all my strength
I'll fight.
Love is stronger than witchcraft.
I'll remember everything — the sound of your voice... your worried looks... the warmth of your arms around me... the touch of your lips.
Good-bye, Wally.
Good-bye, my darling.
I'll remember. i'll always remember.
Always.
Always. Always.
Look at him.
Is it not good to see him suffer?
Yes, Father.
Is this not a perfect revenge on the Wooleys?
Yes, Father.
Could we follow him?
And why?
To watch him suffer, of course.
Well said, Jennifer!
Thou art a witch again!
She's dead, Master Wooley.
Thy marriage is a mournful memory.
Let's be gone, Jennifer.
Let me tarry but a moment at this window.
I wish to see it all.
Thou art enjoying it, eh?
Oh, yes. And thou?
I cannot remember when I've had a better time.
[ Cackles ]
It's great in here.
I've called a doctor,
Mr. Wooley.
Jennifer?
The sound of his voice — it no longer thrills thee?
- No, Father.
- Good.
And his worried looks?
And the warmth of his arms around thee?
These are things that have no meaning for me now.
And the touch of his lips?
Wally... love is stronger than witchcraft. d For tonight I'll merry, merry be d d For tonight
I'll merry, merry be d
- d Tomorrow I'll be sober dd
- Oh, no, you won't.
Wally, darling, all our troubles are over.
At least for the present.
Mr. Wooley...
I've been with your family for 37 years, but this is the end.
- What is it, Margaret?
- I simply cannot handle your daughter!
Jennifer!
I told you never to play with that broom.
Why?
I'm afraid we're going to have trouble with her someday.
Oh, that's impossible.
I hope. d Good night, ladies d d We're going to leave you now dd
Topper Returns
Based on the fictional characters conceived by the late THORNE SMITH
Hey, you're alright down there?
Stay where you are. Don't move, keep calm!
Don't get excited. I'll get you out of there right away.
Keep calm.
Want to help?
There you are.
What did we hit?
Nothing. We had a blow out.
I don't understand it, either. That was a brand new tire this morning.
What's the matter? You sure you're alright?
A little shaky, I guess.
Come on. Sit down over here.
What am I, an orphan?
Come on.
Any man that drives this fast as you ought to be run out of this country.
You tell me all about it some time.
Thanks for the lift, buddy.
Say I'm awfully sorry about this.
You're sorry. How about us?
We can't stay here all night.
Well, you won't have to.
I said I'll get you to Carrington Hall and I will.
How? You're going to fly us on a broom?
I'll get help. We passed a garage about 2 miles back.
Now you take it easy and don't worry about a thing. I'll be back in a flash with a tow car.
Why it's as simple as falling off a log.
Hah... comfortable?!
Don't go away, now.
Must have been his wife with him.
Uh-oh. Danger ahead. Two of 'em.
Oh, thank you. It was awfully sweet of you to stop for us.
- But I...
- Ann you get in the back seat.
Can you manage the bags?
Yes, I think so.
Never mind. There.
Now, mind if I sit on you lap?
- Oh really, my dear young lady I 
- I really sorry but we have to inconvenience you but we had a blow out.
This is comfortable. Well, what are we waiting for?
Oh, very well Eddie. Drive on.
Yes, sir.
Would you mind telling me where you ladies are taking me?
To the Carrington Estate.
Uh-oh.
Is there anything wrong with the Carrington Place?
Yes, ma'am. If there wasn't anybody living there, it would be a haunted house.
My, my Cosmo is late.
He's usually home by now.
My it's chilly isn't it?
Emily remind me to send this coat back. It doesn't keep me warm at all.
Mrs. Topper you haven't got it on.
Oh, how silly of me.
Why strange how it's usually so cold in the winter and warm in the summer, isn't it?
Oh, there's Cosmo now! Hello!
Oh look. Someone's waving to us.
It's a lady.
It's worse than that, boss. It's Mrs. Topper.
Emily, look! He's got a car load of women.
And one of them... one of them is sitting on his lap!
Oh my, Emily!
Well, here it is.
Are you sure this is the Carrington Place?
Yes, that's what they call it.
Cheerfully little eye full, isn't it?
Thanks for the lift, Mr. Topper.
Don't mention it. Hurry up with those bags Eddie.
Yes, sir. I waste no time around here.
I'd like to invite you in but...
Ah, no thanks. Very well, we got to be getting home.
We sure do.
Good Bye.
Good Bye.
Bye.
Good evening.
Why don't you knock before you come out?
I'm the butler, Miss Carrington.
Oh I'm not Miss Carrington. There she is.
How do you do.
Won't you please step in.
- Miss Carrington?
- Yes.
I'm Lillian the housekeeper.
How do you do. This is my friend, Miss Richards.
Howdy.
- Your father is waiting, Miss.
- Thank you.
Would you mind waiting here! This way please.
One moment please.
Miss Carrington.
This is Dr. Jeris your father's physician.
How do you do, Dr. Jeris.
I'd like a few words with you, Miss Carrington before you see your father.
Of course.
I'll be as brief as possible. Your father is far from being a well man, Miss Carrington.
Yes, I know.
Seeing you for the first time may be something of a shock to him.
I think I understand doctor.
He's been looking forward to your arrival with great eagerness.
I hope there will never an occasion for you to be separated from him again.
Come with me, please.
Mr. Carrington.
Mr. Carrington!
Mmmph
This is your daughter.
Ann.
I... I don't know quite what to do or say!
Nor do I.
Except to tell you, Ann you're beautiful.
You're the image of your mother when she was young.
Perhaps you'd better sit down.
Yes.
I know you must think it very strange, seeing your own father for the first time, on the eve of your twenty-first birthday.
Well naturally, I wondered why you never sent for me.
Your mother loved the far east, Ann.
Her last wish was for you to be brought up in the land she loved so well.
I wanted to send for you many times but I had to respect your mother wishes.
Of course my own health wouldn't permit me to visit you.
I understand, father.
I hope you had a pleasant trip?
Yes we, we had a wonderful trip!
We?
Oh, I brought a friend along with me.
An American girl named Gail Richards.
Her father is the head of an exporting company in Shanghai.
Richards, you say?
Mmmm.
Why, I hope you don't mind my bringing her?
Oh, of course not!
Besides, the house belongs to you now.
No father, to us.
No my dear. By the terms of your mother's will, everything belongs to after tomorrow.
What else do you do around here besides wind clocks?
Been here long?
Twenty years.
Twenty years.
Looks like it might turn out to be a steady job. Huh?
Your mother wanted you to have these Ann.
There exactly as she wore them twenty years ago.
Oh, Dad! There..there beautiful!
They'll look every bit as beautiful on you as they did upon your mother.
Dad, I never did know just how mother died.
Some sort of an accident, wasn't it?
Yes, dear. A mine cave in.
I met your mother in Singapore.
After you were born, we decided to move to Sumatra where I had an interest with a Tungstine mine.
My partner was a man called Walter Harburk.
One day he was showing your mother through the mine. Suddenly there was an earthquake.
The tunnel collapsed.
You've talked enough, Mr. Carrington.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but we mustn't tire your father.
Oh, of course not.
I hope you like your room, dear.
I'm sure I will.
Lillian will show you where it is. I'm supposed to conserve my strength.
-Quite alright father.
-Good night.
Goodnight, darling. See you in the morning.
Goodnight.
Good Night, Dr. Gerad.
Good night, Miss Carrington.
Where's Miss Richards?
Here am I, pal.
Ann! Ann, look out!
Look out!
Ann!
Ann!
Ann!
Ann, are you hurt?
Oh, no. I'm alright.
Oh! What on earth happened?
Well, I don't know.
That was a rather close call.
Close? Six more inches, and we'd all be singing 
 "Annie doesn't live here anymore."
How could such a thing happen.
Please, Mr. Carrington. You mustn't excite yourself.
I think you better show the young ladies to their rooms.
Yeah, pick us a couple without chandeliers, will ya?
This way, please.
Thank's, old boy.
Look.
The Chinese room will be yours, Miss Richards.
Oh, you're a doll.
Well, this is just dandy.
I traveled 7000 miles to get away from china men, and here I am with everything but a bowl of rice.
What's that sound?
It's the waves, angry waves.
Day after day, night after night, they beat with savage fury against the black rocks below.
For twenty years, they have been, calling, calling, calling to someone who never answers.
Just like the pot of gold program.
Will that be all, Miss?
No, I'm starved. You forgot we didn't have any dinner.
Rama will bring you a tray.
Oh anything little will do...lobster, salad, and beer, but nothing heavy.
Anything for you, Miss Carrington?
No thank you, Rama
I'm going to bed, Gail. I'm all in.
I'm kind of baggy myself.
-Good night Miss Richards.
-Good night.
I hope you rest in peace.
Thank you.
Isn't that what they write on tombstones?
Oh, don't be silly. Go on to bed.
Good night, darling.
Your father had this room done especially for you.
Lovely.
Sorry miss, but we have no beer.
I brought you some wine. Wine?
Why that's champagne!
Yes, miss.
Put it down, buddy.
Will there be anything else, miss? Oh that's all, thank you.
Champagne! Why hide it?
-Ann.
-Yes?
Is that you?
Yes, it's me.
Well open up, let me in.
Gee, where's the glass slipper that goes with it?
It is nice, isn't it?
Nice? It's heaven, compared to that Chinese torture chamber I'm in.
Gee, what a layout!
This is for me.
I've always wanted to sleep in one of these covered wagons.
It's almost too nice to sleep in.
What do you have to do to get a bed like this? Rub a magic lantern?
You really like this room, don't you?
This is right up my alley.
Oh, to catch measles, and have to stay in a bed like this.
Where you goin'?
Going to bed.
Goodnight, darling. This room is yours.
Oh, no you don't. I wouldn't dream of letting you do anything like that.
But it's a deal. Anything to keep out of China.
Goodnight, Cinderella.
Goodnight, pal. And I do mean pal.
Say uh lock your door in case Lady Frankenstein walks in her sleep.
Come in.
Did you wish anything, doctor?
Are the young ladies comfortable?
Quite.
That will be all then.
I don't mind if I do.
China was never like this.
Cosmo Topper
It's alright for a school boy.
Cara, I told you repeatedly and insistently when I could get a word in edge wise. that the whole thing is no fault of mine.
I think it's ridiculous for a man of your age to pursue young girls.
What will the neighbours think?
I didn't pursue them. They forced themselves on me.
Don't be absurd.
Imagine girls, pretty girls pawning themselves on a middle aged man.
Why I don't think I'm paunchy.
Don't try to change the subject.
At least you might have waved to me when you went by.
I've explained that Darling. I couldn't. That girl was sitting on my lap.
I know she was.
I warn you Cosmo, if ever you do a thing like this again,
I'm going back to mama.
Of course I don't intend to do a thing like that again.
Besides, I couldn't very well sit on her lap, could I?
Cosmo, this is hardly the time for jokes.
That's peculiar.
I don't think it's so peculiar.
After all, we've been married for twenty years.
And I have a perfect right to be treated like a wife who's been married for twenty years.
That's odd.
It's not odd at all!
Cosmo, do you realize what you're saying?
I beg your pardon?
Well if that is all the attention you are going to give me...
I may as well go to bed. Good night.
I might be a little overweight.
Well, I'm certainly not ponchy.
Actually, I'm in pretty good shape for the shape that I am.
After all, I'm a banker, not a glamor boy.
Get your cold feet off my back.
You don't need all the covers, do you?
Here I am Toppy. Remember me? The girl who sat on your lap?
Oh, this is terrible!
What's terrible?
You're a ghost! You're dead!
No kidding.
You better get out of here. I've had enough trouble with you kind of people.
Well, that's strange, I should be dead.
I was young and healthy, and I felt swell when I went to bed. So why did I die?
I don't know, but you can't stay here. You have to go back to the Carrington house.
Cosmo?
There, you see?
Cosmo!
Quick, do something, vanish!
Well, alrightToppy, here I go.
Oh it's you, dear.
Cosmo, who on Earth were you talking to?
Nobody, dear.
Nobody. I was just talking in my sleep.
Talking in your sleep? Well, that is such a waste of time. Besides, nobody can hear you.
Oh, well, I'm not so sure about that.
Cosmo, I'm sorry I was so mean. I know you'd tell me if there was anything between you and that girl.
Let's forget all about it.
I'd like to dear, but under the circumstances, I'm afraid I can't.
Of course, if that is the way you feel about it, I'll talk to you in the morning.
When you're sober.
Why don't you look where you're going?
Why don't you be where you are? Now see what you've done?
There's nothing compared with what I'm going to do if you don't come with me.
Come with you? Where?
Back to the Carrington house.
I'm curious to know what happened to me.
Go ahead.
Oh no, no I couldn't go alone, I'm afraid.
I don't like that house, it's spooky.
I won't go!
Alright, if that's the way you feel about it.
Get out of my bed.
I won't, not unless you come with me.
You get out of my bed or I'll tell Mrs. Topper.
What would you tell her?
I'll tell her you're in my bed.
Oh no, I can't say I agree with that.
Not very well, but I can.
Oh, but you wouldn't do that. Topper wouldn't understand.
You coming with me or not?
I can't!
Alright then, I'll give your three to make up your mind.and then I'll scream.
-One, two...
-No.
Please, please don't!
Alright, you win. Now, what do you want me to do now?
Call your chauffeur and tell him to take us to the Carrington House.
Hello?
Yes, boss.
Well, it ain't daylight yet!
Oh, you know that, huh?
Yes sir, right away.
What are you gaping at?
Wish I knew
Oh, come on! get going
Yes sir
-Where to, Mr. Toppins?
-Carrington place.
Pardon me Boss, but could I sought an inquire what we're going to the Carrington place for?
To look for a body.
Better look for one for me too, cause' the one i'm using now is numb.
Come on Eddie, you wanna help me
-With what boss?
-With the body
-The bo...
Okay, I'll go with you but kinda keep to one side because I got a feeling some runners gonna be done
Toppey, that's the bedroom I was in, the one with the balcony
-How are we gonna get in?
-Through the window.
Pardon me Boss, but can I get confidential for a moment?
What is it?
-Do I look as pale as I feel?
-What's the matter with you?
-I don't know but there's somebody here
-Oh, come, come on
Give me your arm Toppy!
Them ain't rabbit trap!
Toppy, here's the window.
 -Let's see if we can get in!
We can't do that, we'll wake up the house owner
Don't argue
Here I'll give you a boost. Put your foot up.
-Ready?
-Yeah
Upsie dasie oooh
You oughta go on a diet.
Try the window
Now get me in.
-Where are you?
-Right here
-Is this the room?
-Yes
-Where were you?
-Well, let me see.
-Oh yeah! I was sleeping in that bed.
And then it seems like I got up to close the window.
There is the window, then I stared back to bed and that's all I remember
Oh my gosh, there I am!
Look right by the window!
This is probably horable!
You've been stabbed!
Stabbed?!
This is not time for champagne
Oh but Toppin, not everyday a girl is murdered.
Look at me.
Oh please, please, please!
Because this is serious, we better call the police.
Yes,
-I wanna find out who did this to me.
-Where's the telephone?
-Down stares.
Hello.
Operator... operator, operator!
-This thing is dead.
-Uhm, an epidemic
- Where are you?
 - Here I am, sweetie.
Can't seem to get anybody.
Maybe the wires have been cut.
I'll trace 'em.
Operator, operator!
Put down that phone.
Stay where you are!
Your phone is out of
-Who are you?
-Who? me? I'm Cosmo Topper.
I-I-I'm your next door neighbor.
N-n-nice place you got here.
Very nice. I-I-I
I-I just dropped in to use the phone.
-At 12:30 in the morning.
-Oh, well I must be going.
No...must...
-Who were you calling?
-The police. There's been a murder in here.
Don't look at me like that. I didn't kill the girl.
What on earth are you people doing?
I have found this man troweling about the house.
This gentleman says there's been a murder!
What are you talking about?
If you don't believe me, go and see it yourselves in the big room at the top of the stairs.
Why...why that's Ann's room!
Come on!
Anne!
Where is she?
Right over there, by the window.
Where? there's no one here.
I saw it here a few minutes ago with my own eyes!
Father. What's the matter?
Anne! You're safe. You're all right.
Well, of course I am. Why?
Well, Miss Carrington, this gentlemen was just telling us that you'd been murdered.
Oh, Mr. Topper! Well, what ever gave you that idea?
No, it's not you. It's the other girl!
I saw her a minute ago. Now, really, I did.
- Where is Gail? 
- She wasn't downstairs, was she?
Of course not. How could she be downstairs when she was murdered up here!?
Now, Mr. Topper. Please, control yourself.
I think I found something that might explain matters.
It's addressed to Miss Carrington.
Darling, sorry to run out on you so mysteriously, will explain everything when I get back. Love, Gail.
Mr. Topper is evidently suffering from hallucinations.
Mister Topper... how older man are you?
- Ah, just as I thought.
- What do you mean, "just as you thought"?
-Schizophrenia
-Schizophrenia nothing! I came here in my car.
-Your car?
Yes! is right outside, right now! waiting for me!
Cosmo! Cosmo! Cosmo!
-Edward! 
-Yes Ma'am!
-What in the world is wrong with you? 
-It ain't me, it's them things!
Thing?!
Doors closing by themselves, people talking to nothing and getting answers
I'm going back!
-Back where? 
-To Mr. Benny, ain't nothing like this ever happened there
Oh stop all this pittle-pattle, where's Mr. Topper?
He's over to that Carrington place.
- That girl again!
 - He means the one that sat in his lap?
I'm afraid, too. Emily, get on your clothes, we're going right over there.
'Scuse me Ma'am, but are you aiming to walk?
Well certainly not! You're going to drive us.
My my that's what I was afraid of.
-Normal? 
 -As normal as you would expect for this type of man.
I've lost the body, I've lost my car! If I don't get out of here very soon, I'll lose my mind!
What he needs more than anything else is rest.
When he feels better, we'll send him home in my car and dear you better go to bed.
-Goodnight Mr. Topper 
 -Goodnight
Mr. Topper, Gail's disappearance has me worried.
Well look what he's done to me!
Where did you last see her?
She was sitting on a table in the hall and she hung my hat on a Chinaman's foot.
Just take it easy, Mr. Topper. The car will be along in a few minutes.
Well, do you remember me?
Yes, of course, but... what are you doing here?
Well, I hate to be commercial, lady, but somebody owes me $26.80.
That's right. I'm sorry. I forgot.
You also forgot to say goodbye.
That was a cute disappearing act you and your partner pulled.
You... You didn't by chance see her? You didn't pass her on the road?
Well, no. What is she? A sleepwalker?
I... I don't know, but... She's gone.
Oh? Disappeared again. Say she must have been raised in a magician's hat.
I... I'll get your money for you.
Well, what's the matter?
Anything wrong?
I hate to go up those stairs.
Would you mind coming with me?
Upstairs?
With you?
- I better come back in the morning.
- Please. Won't you come?
- I better come back in the morning.
- Please. Won't you come?
Say, are you in a jam or something?
Just nervous I guess.
Nervous? Why?
I can't explain, but... Well, things have been happening and...
Well, you can stop worrying, honey. Nothing's going to happen to you.
Come on.
I'd hate to pay the light bill in a joint like this.
Oh, this is my room.
Well... if you don't mind, euh... I'll just wait here.
Miss Carrington! Miss Carrington!
What's going on here? Who's that guy in the black coat?
What happened to her? Who are you?
- I'm the housekeeper!
- Fine way to keep house! Women screaming. Boogymen jumping out of windows!
If I had a house like this, I wouldn't want to keep it.
Miss Carrington! Miss Carrington! Miss Carrington!
- What's going on here?
- I just said that.
Who are you? And don't tell me you're this girl's rich uncle!
- Why don't be silly. I'm her father.
- Well, that's close enough.
Anne! Anne!
She's fainted.
I'll bet you the first thing she says when she opens her eyes is, "Where am I?"
What happened?
Say! What are you doing here?
All right! So, I'll explain it to you.
This young lady owes me for a taxi cab ride. I came here to collect it. She asked me up to this room.
This young lady owes me for a taxi cab ride. I came here to collect it. She asked me up to this room.
I heard and scream and walked into the middle of an Orson Wells broadcast!
- A man was standing over me with a knife.
- There it is. There!
- Where did you get that knife?
- Well, I found it under the window in the next room.
Perhaps, Topper's story was right.
He said they murdered the other girl. Now they've tried to murder Anne!
Braumer... call the police!
Oh, well, now, wait a minute! You don't think I had anything to do with this.
- Well, do you?
- Why, certainly not!
Anne, dear, you'd better get your clothes on.
I'm afraid you're going to remain here, young man.
But good heavens! Why should anybody want to kill Miss Carrington?
Well, they killed me, didn't they?
- Yes, I can understand that. But, Miss Carrington--
- Oh, don't worry about her anymore.
- Yes, I can understand that. But, Miss Carrington--
- Oh, don't worry about her anymore.
She's got a nice, handsome bodyguard. He's a taxi driver.
Maybe he's the one that's doing all the killing.
Nonsense! He didn't bring his cab in the house with him!
Well, then. If she's safe there's no reason for me to stay.
Good night. I've had a lovely time.
Oh, Toppy, don't run out now. We've got to find out who killed me.
Then we'll know who's threatening Anne.
Yes, but I don't want my wife threatening me, you see. And she will if she finds out.
- No. I'm going home.
- Oh!
Madam, I'm quite sure you're mistaken!
I'm not mistaken. I know I'm not. I'm Mrs. Topper!
- Aren't I, Edward?
- Yes, ma'am, but I don't think that's what the gentleman means.
I certainly do know what I mean, don't I?
Frankly, madam, I don't know.
- Well, who does?
- What do you say we start from the beginning?
That's a good idea. Where is my husband?
But, madam, I don't know! This is a private home.
Private! It looks more like a parade ground!
Can I help you?
You certainly can!
Do you live here?
Yes... I do.
I'm Mrs. Topper. I'm looking for my husband, Mr. Topper. Oh...
Where's that friend of yours, the one that goes around sitting on people's laps?
- Well, I...
- She's been murdered, according to your husband.
Don't change the subject. If you won't help us, we'll find him ourselves. Come along, Emily.
- I think you'll find him in the sitting room.
- The sitting room.
Maybe she's still sitting on his lap.
Sitting on his lap! Good heavens!
You mean you've got a room just for that? Where is it?
Uh, right this way.
Come along, Emily. Come along.
Here she comes. You've got to go.
I don't trust you, bunny. You'll try to run out on me.
How can I run out with her there? And how can I face her with you here?
Well, sounds logical. Okay, here we go.
[Ghost]
Come on, fella!
Cosmo... Cosmo!
Well? Where is he?
He was here a few minutes ago.
Braumer, what happened to him?
I don't know, sir. But I'm positive he hasn't left the house.
And he won't! Not 'til I find him and give him a piece of my mind.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
Well... Where's the telephone?
- Right this way. 
- Come along, Emily.
Come along, Edward.
Cosmo! Cosmo! 
Cosmo!!
Operator? Operator, I want to report a missing husband.
- Edward, you look for him down that way.
- It's awful dark down there.
- Edward, you look for him down that way.
- It's awful dark down there.
Darkness never hurt anyone!
It ain't the darkness, Mrs. Topper, it's what's in it!
Don't be silly. There's no difference between light and dark... except the lights are out!
Run along!
I'll go, but... every hair on my coat is standing on end.
Cosmo Topper? Well, what's he look like?
Like a banker. Of course, that's because he is a banker.
- Well, can you describe him?
- Well, he wears a size 15 shirt with a 33 sleeve.
- Well, can you describe him?
- Well, he wears a size 15 shirt with a 33 sleeve.
...a 9 1/2 sock (lyle), and is slightly bald.
Oh, yes. There's something else.
Let me see. I paid the milkman. That lunch has been changed from Thursday to Friday...
Oh, yes! There's been a murder.
Murder!
Yes. Murder.
Capital M U R D E R. Murder.
Trying to make these policemen understand something is harder than doing it yourself!
Mr. Topper?
Hey, Eddie. Got a cigarette?
Give me a match.
Mr. Topper! Mr. Topper! 
Mr. Topper!
Oh, Mr. Toppeeeerrr!
Cosmo!
Cosmo?
Cosmo, where are you?
[Ghost]
Why, Toppy! What are you doing here?
Oh, where are you?
[Ghost]
Behind the screen... getting dressed.
[Ghost]
You little sassy-face! Didn't your ma ever tell you to knock on a lady's bedroom door before you barge in?
This is most embarrassing! Why couldn't you stay the way you were?
[Ghost]
A neglige is hardly appropriate for solving crimes.
Come on, Toppy. We've got things to do.
Cosmo!
Gotta get out of here!
Cosmo?
- I'm from headquarters. What's the trouble here?
- Trouble, sir?
Now, don't stand there dumb! I got a phone call about a half an hour ago that there's been a murder!
And maybe you did it!
Cosmo!
In here! Quick!
Cosmo!
Cosmo?
Oh, this must be the kitchen!
Well, it's not the music room.
Well, he's not here.
Cosmo? Where on Earth can he be?
Cosmo?...Cosmo!
My! It's drafty in here!
Oh!! Look! It's a chocolate cake!
 Emily, make some tea.
Tea!?
Of course! To go with out cake.
- But what about Mr. Topper?
- Emily, you know he never drinks tea.
Well, yes, I kno...
This is getting awful monotonous!
Now, then... Did you see the face of the man who wore the cloak?
No... it... it was covered up.
Somebody's covering up a lot of things around here!
Well, why don't you let her alone? She's nervous and upset.
She is? How do you think I feel? A murder and no body!
Did anybody see a body?
Didn't you say Topper said he saw the body?
Cut out the double talk! Who's Topper?
He's the man who said he saw the body.
- Where is he?
- He's gone.
He... he's gone? The body's gone!
S-- say, what are you people trying to do to me?
I'm sure, Sergeant, it's nothing but a tempest in a teapot.
Miss Carrington had a note from the supposedly dead girl that will clear it all up.
- Where's the note? 
 - It's gone.
The note's gone. Topper's gone.
 The body's gone!
Now, look here! 
I don't have to come here to be made a fool of!
[Butler]
Beg pardon, sir, but I believe Miss Carrington left the note upstairs.
[Sergeant]
Jim, take the boys upstairs. Search everywhere! Don't miss anything!
Tear it apart!
Now, look here, Rebekah. Quit stalling!
- Where is this guy, Topper?
- I don't know.
- Well, what was he doing here in the first place?
- I don't know.
- Say, what do you think I am?!
- I don't know.
- Who's this fresh guy?
- Oh, he's all right. He's a taxi driver.
Yeah? Well, where's your taxi? Now, don't tell me that's disappeared, too.
Where do you think it is?
I'm not supposed to think! I'm from the city hall!
- Now, where was I?
- I don't know.
Emily, this cake is simply delicious!
- Glad you like it.
- It's the best you've ever made.
-This is not our cake.
- Oh, I forgot!
Get some cream, Emily, please.
Cream... Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, hello.
- Hush!
Emily!
Cosmo! Oh, what in the world are you doing in here?
Just... sitting dear. It's chilly outside.
But... but you... you never used to sit in our icebox!
Getting out of a nice warm bed to come and sit in someone's icebox! I don't understand it.
Oh, but I do understand it. Don't I, Emily?
I... I hope so.
That scream came from in here.
- Hey, look.
- A prowler!
- Who are you?
- I'm Mrs. Topper. Who are you?
Miss... Mrs. Topper!
- Where's your husband?
- In the icebox.
- Has he got the body with him? 
- Certainly. Under his overcoat.
So, you're Topper, huh?
Would you mind coming out of cold storage?
I will not.
Say, what's the matter with him? Is he icebox crazy?
- He's suffering from hallucinations.
- Oh...
You wouldn't, by any chance, be thinking you were a lamb chop?
Now, then! 
What do you mean by stealing into this house in the middle of the night?
And what have you done with that girl you had on your lap?
Girl on his lap, eh? Oho! A love triangle!
Oh, do you really think so, Officer?
I get it. You sneaked into here to see some gal. Your wife followed you.
You had to get rid of the dame, so you knocked her off!
 Yes or no?
I did not.
- Where's the body?
- I don't know.
So, you admit there is a body.
Yes! I came over here to look for it.
- But how did you know it was here?
- She told me.
She? Who's she?
The dead girl.
Well! Now, we're get--
Wait a minute. How could a dead person talk?
I don't know, but... this one does.
Oh, I mean. I know you won't believe what I'm going to tell you, but...
Well, we certainly won't!
Where were you when the attempt was made on Miss Carrington's life?
In the library, I think. I don't know.
Did you or did you not try to stab this young lady?
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Officer. Cosmo wouldn't try to stab anybody.
He can't even carve a turkey.
Now, listen, lady. Somebody kills a dame who talks after she's dead.
And the body gets up and walks away. Somebody tried to whittle on this young lady.
And I find him hiding in the icebox!
[Ghost]
- Here, Toppy. Take this!
- I don't want it.
[Mrs. Topper]
You mean, you're going to arrest him?
Well, these ain't exactly charm bracelets, lady.
He's got a gun!
 It's mine!
Cosmo! Give the man back his gun!
Don't do that!
- Cosmo!
- Corner 'em, somebody!
- Cosmo, you'll hurt yourself!
- Riley, you might have the sticks for this!
- Don't do that. Stop it!
It might go off!
Ah! Oh!
[Ghost]
Come on!
You... shouldn't do that. They'll... Cold!
Let go of me! Let go of me!
You shouldn't have made me do that!
You want to go to jail?
No! But we can't go on like this. My wife, the police, what do you suppose they think?
- They think you're guilty of housebreaking and murder!
- Yes.
Come on, let's find my body!
No, because after we do find it, then I will be accused of murdering you.
But I've got evidence to prove you're innocent!
- What evidence?
- This note I was supposed to have written Anne, but didn't.
- Who did?
- I'll tell you when we find me!
Come on!
You're tired? How you think I feel?
My goodness! What makes it so cold in here?
Bless you.
You and your husband!
When it comes to picking out husbands, Mrs. Topper, you certainly take the cake!
I only took a small piece and a little cup of tea!
That's no reason we should be locked up in here!
Look, Mrs. Topper, I'm not complaining, but... I'm a personal maid and not Admiral Burt!
Oh, Emily, shut up!
We'll all get pneumonia. Can't you break down that door?
It's as solid as a rock! 
[Banging]
- Come in.
- Quiet!
- What's that funny noise?
- It's my teeth chattering!
- Well, why don't you put 'em in your pocket?
- Eh... Who has a screwdriver?
You need a screwdriver to get 'em out?
I've got a bust hook.
- Where is it?
- H-home. On my dresser.
Oh, my-- Come on! Everybody look around. There ought to be something here we can use!
Well, there's nothing in this joint but frozen tomatoes and... dead chickens.
- Look. Can you do something with that?
- Oh, I give up.
- May I suggest, sir, that you break the glass?
- What? 
- Break the glass.
Ok...
 Well, what good did that do?
He means the glass in the door, dummy!
Ok, but I think you're taking a lot of liberties.
Now, wait a minute. I'll take charge of this.
- Ryder, you take the upstairs and you take the downstairs.
- You take this.
Listen to me. I think someone should call the police!
Well, I'll take care of that. Check it for fingerprints.
- Hear that?
- Yeah.
[Ghost]
Quiet, Toppy. Don't be n-nervous.
Give me that.
Eddie! Where have you been?
Boss, that's something I'll never know.
- You still looking for a body?
- Yeah.
It was down there, but it just left.
- It left?
- It just put out to sea.
That's the truth, Boss, but I ain't going back to prove it.
Oh, yes, you are.
Yes, sir. My, my... the things I get myself into!
Come on.
Eddie, you're going to stay right here until we get back.
Yes, sir. But don't bet on it, unless you get awful good odds!
[Ghost]
 Oh, Toppy! You're terrible at rowing the boat.
[Ghost]
 Get up front and let me do the rowing.
[Ghost]
Here we go. Hold tight!
Naw, it ain't!
Yes, it is!
If you go out, I'm going with you!
[Ghost]
 Hurry. Help me up!
- Give me your hand.
- Why do it the hard way?
 Them's the orders I got from the boss and them's the orders I'm passing on to you!
- We're gonna do it my way! See?
- Can't a guy ask questions?
 No! I say we dump her here, right where we dumped Butch and Liver Lip.
It's out ten miles and plenty deep.
Oh, why not wrap her up in a concrete mudpack and drop her right here?
The tide'll take her out.
That's the boss's orders and don't argue with me!
- Go below and get that engine started.
- Okay.
Gail! Come here. Quick!
Here you are. Here!
Oh, dear. I look so uncomfortable!
Stop the engines. We've got to get off.
No. You lower the boat and... and I'll take care of them.
- Get that engine running!
- I had it running. It stopped.
- What stopped it?
- I don't know!
You dummy! How do you expect that engine to run with the juice turned off?
Gimme that! Go on. Get outta the way!
See? Nothin' to it!
TURN IT ON!
And leave it on!
I didn't do it. Honest, I didn't.
[Ghost]
Come on, Toppy.
Well, what are you doing here?
If you'd asked me that a second later, you'd have been talking to yourself!
- What have you got in that boat?
- The body.
- That does it!
- No, you don't!
- Trying to hide it, huh?
- No, no! I'm bringing it back!
Bringing it back? Well, brother, you've got a lot of questions to answer.
I got a hunch it ain't gon' be no quiz program!
- Joe, take 'em upstairs.
- Come on, you.
- Everybody here?
- Yes, sir. All here.
All right.
Now, get this and get it strait!
Nobody leaves this room unless I say so!
And you! Stop chewing that gum!
Chewing? I ain't even breathing!
Not you. Her!
I'm sorry, Miss Carrington. I know this is going to be a bit unpleasant for you, but... will you mind stepping into the next room with me?
Miss Carrington, I'm going to raise this sheet.
See if you can identify this young lady.
- How long had she been living here?
- She came here tonight with Miss Carrington.
Nice lookin' gal. Too bad she had to go so young.
She's got awful big feet, though.
Who did that? Who did that!?
Who hit me when I wasn't lookin'?
Was you in that room just now?
Not now, then or ever!
Well, don't tell me the joint's haunted!
Now, look. I was standing in that room, minding my own business...
Just as I say what big feet she's got, I get slapped in the kisser!
Who did THAT?
- Who went out that door?
- Nobody.
Now, wait a minute! Doors just don't open and shut themselves.
Yeah, but that one did!
Hey! Who went out that door?
- Yehudi.
- Who?
[Y. Menuhin. Song &amp; catchphrase "Who's Yehoodi/Yehudi?"]
- You feel better dear?
- Oh, she'd be alright if Charlie Chan'd let her alone.
Sergeant Roberts, I don't like to interfere, but is it necessary to subject my daughter to all this?
She's terribly nervous. Won't you? Would you please let her go to her room?
Nobody leaves this room, not even me!
And that goes for the both of us.
[Ghost]
 Big feet, huh? I'll match mine with his any day!
[Ghost]
Have another!
[Ghost]
Don't mind if I do!
Innocent men stay home nights. They don't hide in iceboxes.
And they don't take dead bodies on boat rides!
- Why did you kill her? 
 - I didn't.
That's only one man's opinion.
- I can prove it.
 - How?
- Leave me alone in that room for a minute. 
 - Ho, ho!
I am not that dumb.
Well, that's only one man's opinion, too.
Officer, let him have his way. There are no windows in the trophy room.
- Any iceboxes?
 - No
Alright, I'll give you three minutes.
If you're not back in this room with a 14 carat alibi, this lady's gonna make one of the most charming widows I've ever met!
Oh, thank you, Officer.
Gail! Gail, where are you?
[Ghost]
Just getting another bottle, Toppy. Be right with you. You and I will have a little drink together!
[Ghost]
- Whoops! Catch me!
- Watch out!
[Ghost]
Good boy, Toppy. You got me.
Now, you stand up and behave yourself.
[Ghost]
Sweety, let me mush your hair.
Stop it! Will you stop it? This is no time to be playful.
- Where's that note?
- What note?
- Where's that note?
- What note?
The proof you said you had!
[Ghost]
Toppy, I wanna lie down. I'm sleepy! *hic*
You can't get sleepy now! You got me into this and you've got to get me out of it!
[Ghost]
- Give me a hand.
- Oh, dear... here. Come on.
Toppy, I feel so silly! Hee, hee!
Quiet!
[Ghost]
It's like being on a little boat in here.
Try to walk straight!
[Ghost]
Oh, look at the pretty couch!
-There 
 -Oh
Mm, this feels so good!
[Ghost]
Toppy, put my feet up!
Gail, this is serious. Where is that note?
[Ghost]
I dunno.
Try to think what you did with it, or I'll be arrested!
[Ghost]
Put a cold town on my head, sweety, and I'll try and think.
All right, don't, please. Uh...Try to pull yourself together, will you?
Wh-where are you?
Oh, there.
Got a little headache. Have you... got an aspirin on you?
Uh, no... but I'll get you one.
Well, that settles it.
That guy is as nutty as a candy bar!
Send for a straitjacket!
Make it two! One for me.
Get up.
Now, where's that note?
There it is. Down there!
- What does this prove? 
 - I didn't write it.
- Who did?
- Lillian. The housekeeper.
Here's a sample of her handwriting.
They're identical!
Then she must be on it.
Sit down.
-You admit that you write the letter don't you? 
 -Yes
- Yes.
- And this is the note you found in the murdered girl's room?
Yes.
Then how do you account for they're both being the same handwriting?
I don't know.
Listen, sister. It looks like you're all set for a first degree murder rap.
Of course, if you come clean, we could go a little easier on you.
I wasn't alone in this! I wrote the note, but I didn't kill her!
Who did?!
Come on! Who did it?
It... It was... 
[terrified screams]
Turn on the lights! Quick!
Come on, now! Who--
[Taxi Driver]
There's a pickpocket in the joint!
Whoever stole that witness, put her back!
Jim! Search the cellar! Search the icebox! Search the attic!
- Where's the attic?
- Search me! I've been in politics ten years and I've never seen anything as balled up as this is!
Darryl, guard that front door! Don't let anybody in or out!
- What's down there? 
- That's the kitchen.
If I find that dame in the icebox, I'll resign!
And I'll drop dead!
Oh, come, come now! Brace up. Brace up!
I'd appreciate it so much if you'd stay here with my daughter.
I want to talk to Sergeant Roberts.
- That'll be a pleasure, sir.
- Come, come.
- NOW, I GOT YA!
- OH! You horrible man!
I see no reason for us to stay in this awful house while you go around opening and shutting doors.
- Quiet, ple--
- Oh, I will not be quiet!
I'm so nervous, I could scream. In fact, I think I will!
That's fun. Isn't it?
Come on, let's do it together.
Stay here.
That sounds like my wife.
Miss Carrington! Miss Carrington! Miss Carrington!
- Well, where is she?
- She was here a second ago.
- Well, what's happened now?
- Miss Carrington's disappeared.
Well, I left her with him.
Say, what is this? The fun house at the beach?
Everybody that talks to you disappears!
Now, I'm talking to you. I suppose, I'll turn up missing.
That is the best suggestion you've made tonight.
Well, that's alright.
Don't you ever park near a fireplug!
- As for you--
- Officer... I- I want to go home.
I'll tell you when to go and I'll tell you where to go.
Sit down!
Gail! Anne has disappeared!
- Disappeared?
- Entirely.
- Well, we've got to find her!
- Police won't let me out of their sight.
Well, they can't stop me.
Don't go out there. Mrs. Topper's just outside.
I'll fix that.
Well, where is she?
- W-w-where is who, dear?
- You know perfectly well who I mean.
- That- that girl!
- There wasn't any.
Oh, yes there was! I heard you both in that room.
Pardon me, Mrs. Topper, but it's getting kinda late.
- Can't we settle this at home?
- Edward, don't interrupt!
Yessim.
Cosmo, I should think after twenty years of married life you wouldn't try to deceive me.
Why, I remember our honeymoon in Atlantic City. You promised me you'd never look at another woman.
Mr. Topper!
You better keep away from me or you'll be a coat.
Hey. [Whistle] Taxi!
Clara, please. I've had a frightful night.
Boss, wait! Don't sit in that chair!
Whatever you do, don't sit in that chair!
Edward, will you stop interrupting?
Well, you're all wet! Is it raining out?
Oh, but you haven't been out. Can't be raining in.
Well, if it has, it's all cleared up.
Clara, I can't stand much more.
Hold on, Boss. That chair is deceptive, destructible, dis-trustworthy and this is the voice of experience!
What are you talking about?
Boss, you sit in that chair and things happen. Quick!
- Oh, don't talk nonsense.
- It ain't nonsense. It's serious.
Look, Boss. I sat in that chair just like this.
Crossed my leg just like this.
Leaned back-- 
Here I go again!
Well, that's a silly way to leave the room! Why didn't he use the door?
Mr. Toppeeeeer!
Well, as I was saying, I'll always stand by you no matter what happens.
Clara, dear, just be quiet. Would you, please?
Well, if that's the way you feel about it, I won't say another word.
Cosmo, what a charming idea! We should have one of these in our house for weekend guests.
Really!
Clara, for heaven's sake! Get out of there.
Okay! You take it down this way and you go upstairs. If you find anything I'll be right here.
Boy, what a night!
I've never been on such a merry-go-round in my life!
Oh, I sure needed that one! Toppy, I just saw the murderer in the cellar.
- Who is he? 
- I don't know. I couldn't see his face, but he was all muffled up in a big, black cloak.
Well, whoever he is, he was in that room when the housekeeper disappeared, because I found a contraption in the fireplace that operates the chair she was sitting on.
- Toppy.
- What?
- We've got to make him convict himself.
- How?
- You sit in that chair and tell them that you know who the murderer is.
Me? Sitting in that chair?
- But-but I'll disappear, too!
- Oh, no. Not if you keep your eye on the fireplace.
And the first one that makes a move toward it, that's the one we're after!
You're not afraid?
What makes you think I'm not?
I simply want to tell all I know.
Well, that shouldn't take very long. Sit down!
Now, cut out the stalling! Who killed Gail Richards? Pick him out!
In the first place, the one they wanted to kill was Miss Carrington.
Well, never mind who they were after. Who dunnit?
The murderer...
Didn't know he'd killed the wrong girl.
When he found out, he was panicky and hid the body.
You see, doctor, I did not have hallucinations.
Very interesting.
Say, what are you watching that fireplace for?
Who do you expect? Santa Claus?
Come on! Who dunnit?
The housekeeper knew. She knew too much.
But she wasn't the one.
When she was about to confess, she disappeared from this very chair.
And the person who caused her disappearance was standing right beside this fireplace when it happened.
What do you say, Doc? He's looking right, straight at you.
The man's mad. I was nowhere near the fireplace when it happened.
I was over there.
Braumer, you were standing here by the fireplace.
You're mistaken, Dr. Jerris. I was standing by the library door.
Now, wait a minute. Who was standing by the fireplace when the housekeeper disappeared?
Why, Father. You were there!
Why, yes!
Come to think of it, I was.
Mr. Carrington, would you mind sitting in that chair?
Of course not.
That's enough! Get 'em up, all of ya!
Get 'em up!
Get 'em up!
- Father!
- Never mind that! Put your hands up, too!
And if you've got any sense, you won't move a muscle!
You see? I told you it was him.
Sergeant Roberts, it's been a pleasure to do business with a man of your intelligence.
[Ghost]
Take your hands off that wheel!
[Ghost]
Don't be a backseat driver. Sit down!
[Ghost] 
That was a close one!
[Road Under Construction]
[Ghost]
Hold tight! Here we go again!
Well, it serves you right! Oh, I'd hate to be in your shoes.
First murder and now reckless driving.
The Recording Angel will certainly throw the book at you!
Say, what are you doing here?
- Steady, old boy.
- I beg your pardon.
Now. Why did you try to kill your daughter?
Oh, don't be silly! I'm not Anne's father.
- Who are you?
- I'm Walter Harburg, Carrington's partner.
- Carrington was killed in a mine cave-in.
- So, that's it.
Why, you ghost of a double-crossing crook! Anne must know about this!
- Too late now.
- Oh, no. We're stuck here until she finds out.
And when she knows the truth, I can go to Heaven and you can go to-- Uh, give me a pencil. Quick!
- And a piece of paper.
- Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Take a letter.
"Dear Anne, I am not your father. Period."
Well, if he was looking for an accident he sure found it.
This is going to cost him his driver's license. You know that, don't you?
[Ghost]
Here, Toppy. Give this to Anne.
I'm sorry about your father, Miss Carrington.
Wait a minute. He wasn't her father. Miss Carrington, this is for you.
- Well, what's this all about?
- Well, here. Read it. Or am I expecting too much?
- Where did you get this note?
- It... flew into my hands.
Notes that fly! Fathers that ain't fathers! 
Leaping chairs!
Come on. Let's get out of here before the trees start talking!
Edward! Edward, where are you?
Here I am!
- And here I go!
- Edward, come back here!
Not me! From now on, I used to be your chauffeur!
- But you've got to drive us home!
- Not in that car.
Enough is enough and that's what I've had a abundancy of!
Very well. If that's the way you feel about it, Emily will drive us.
And Cosmo, this time, I'll sit on your lap.
All right, darling.
Emily, do you know how to drive?
- No, ma'am.
- Oh, isn't it exciting?
Thanks, Eddie. You've been a great help!
Sorry, I had to dump you in the water, old boy.
The End
There's a curse upon this village... the curse of Frankenstein.
Aye.
Aye, it is true.
The whole countryside shuns the village.
Our fields are barren, the inn is empty.
My little ones cry in their sleep.
They are hungry. There is no bread.
It's the curse, the curse of Frankenstein.
This is nonsense, folks.
You talk as though these were the Dark Ages.
You know as well as I do... that the monster died in the sulphur pit under Frankenstein's tower... and that Ygor, his familiar... was riddled with bullets from the gun of Baron Frankenstein himself.
But Ygor does not die that easily.
They hanged him and broke his neck, but he lives.
Haven't I seen him, sitting beside the hardened sulphur pit... playing his weird horn, as if to lure the monster... back from death to do his evil bidding.
You talk like frightened children.
Well, if something isn't done... there'll be a new mayor after the fall election.
Aye!
- What do you want me to do?
- Destroy the castle.
Wipe the last traces of these accursed Frankensteins from our land.
- The people are right, Your Honour.
- I agree, Your Honour.
I don't believe that these dead wretches can affect the prosperity of this village.
But do as you will with the castle.
It's yours.
We'll blow it up!
Look! Old Ygor!
I told you he was alive.
All the more reason to blow up the castle.
Die, you fiend! You swine!
My friend!
They didn't kill you!
You lived through the pit, the sulphur pit!
Sulphur was good for you, wasn't it?
It preserved you.
We have to hurry. Hurry.
Come. I help you, my friend.
Come, my friend.
Now you live forever. They can't destroy you.
Come. We go away.
We have to hurry.
They dynamite the castle.
They're too late. We fooled them.
Come. We go to the country.
A better country than this.
No!
Come back!
No!
The lightning.
It is good for you.
Your father was Frankenstein.
But your mother was the lightning.
She has come down to you again.
We will go to Ludwig, the second son of Frankenstein.
He has all the secrets of his father, who created you.
We will force him to harness the lightning for you.
It will give you strength, strength of a hundred men.
Come.
We are going to find Dr. Frankenstein.
There you are, gentlemen.
The usual post-surgical treatment.
Think of it.
The first time the human brain has been removed from the skull... subjected to surgery, and then replaced.
With success, we hope.
After all, Dr. Frankenstein, we have to remember... the patient was violently dementia praecox.
Medical science has advanced a great deal... since you made your experiment, Dr. Bohmer.
It's unfortunate that it had such tragic consequences.
But you blazed the trail.
It was you who pointed the way.
If you should want me, gentlemen,
I shall be in my library completing my notes.
- How's the patient, Dr. Kettering?
- All indications excellent.
Respiration, pulse, everything.
- Wonderful, wasn't it?
- Yes.
Wonderful.
A bit belated, perhaps, but wonderful nevertheless.
Why live always in the past, Dr. Bohmer?
You've allowed that one mistake of yours to embitter your whole life.
Mistake? No.
Just a slight miscalculation, that's all.
But my experiment was a success.
In those days...
I was the master.
Frankenstein was just the pupil.
But I made a slight miscalculation.
Please, what is the name of this village?
- Vasaria.
- Pretty place.
Is there a doctor named Frankenstein...
Ludwig Frankenstein in the village?
You mean the one who heals those who are sick in mind?
Yes. That's the one I mean.
- Do you know the doctor?
- Very well.
I know his father and his brother, too.
He lives in a chateau at the end of the village.
- A large house with a high wall.
- Yes. Thank you.
I'll show her how to boot it.
Look at your ball up there.
- How do you like that?
- All the way up on the roof.
Hello.
Are you a giant?
Can you get my ball?
Way up there.
- Isn't that your child, Hussman?
- Yes!
No!
Don't do that. Do you want to kill my child?
Cloestine, ask your friend to bring you down, dear.
Ask your friend to bring you down.
Please take me down to Daddy.
Tell him no one will hurt him.
Take me down.
My daddy says no one will hurt you.
- Get him!
- No! You promised not to hurt him.
- Where are you going, Erik?
- Hello, Elsa. I didn't see you.
What are you doing driving around the countryside... in the middle of the day?
Town prosecutor should be in his office, working.
Sometimes my work takes me out of my office.
- I came to see your father.
- That's pretty.
I flattered myself that you came way out here to take me for a drive.
I wish that were the case, darling.
Nothing could make me happier.
But this is a very serious matter.
I must see your father.
Since you put it that way,
I'll have to find him.
Come in.
- Father, you have a visitor.
- And a very welcome one, too.
Delighted to see you, Erik. How are you?
You look worried.
Elsa been treating you badly?
No, not at all, sir.
Be patient. Wait till you're married.
Doctor, we have a madman in jail.
I'd like you to examine him and advise us.
Well, I have some work to do, but I'll come later.
But this is urgent.
He's already killed two villagers.
We have him chained but if he breaks loose, he can tear down the building.
- That's rather an exaggeration, isn't it?
- No, indeed, sir.
He's huge, a monster.
I've never seen anything like him.
Very well, Erik.
As soon as I finish my work, I'll come down.
Thank you, sir. I'll be expecting you.
Come.
There's a man in the waiting room to see you, Doctor. He says it's very urgent.
He comes from the village of Frankenstein.
Very well, I'll see him.
Martha...
I'd rather my daughter didn't know about this visitor.
Certainly, sir.
How does it feel to face a man you thought your brother killed, Doctor?
- What do you want?
- The monster is with me.
He's the one in the police station.
But he won't be there long.
You will bring him here.
- The law must take its course.
- Law! What can the law do to him?
Do you think they can keep him in jail?
He is more dangerous today than he ever was before.
Besides his sick brain, he has a sick body.
You can make him well, Frankenstein.
How? What can I do?
You can harness the lightning, as your father did.
Pour life into his hungry veins.
Give him back the strength he once had.
Will you do it, Frankenstein?
Ever since the day my father put life into that creature, it has been a curse.
The terrible consequences of his creation killed my father... and drove my brother into exile.
The monster shall not ruin my life.
I'm happy here.
I have a lovely daughter, friends.
They know nothing of all this.
You wouldn't like to spoil that, Doctor, would you?
You wouldn't want me to tell them... that you are the son of the Frankenstein that created him... that your brother made the thing live... after it had been dead for years.
Do you want me to tell them, Frankenstein?
No.
All right.
Then you'll make the police to hand him over to you.
Yes.
I could do that.
And you will do it, Frankenstein.
Very well.
Now get out!
Father, who was that strange man I saw leaving the house?
Nobody of any consequence, darling.
A patient.
He smiled at me.
A cruel smile.
It was dreadful.
Well, you know what my patients are.
Don't let it worry you.
Now come along, my dear.
I must be getting down to the village.
Order! Order, please!
I've read the report on the nameless prisoner.
I don't understand the urgency that requires an immediate hearing.
This is an unusual case, sir.
The prisoner's dangerous.
It'd be wise to remand him to the higher court... and transfer him to the city soon.
I understand the man is insane.
There's no doubt of it.
But that's for the higher court to determine.
We should make a report on the prisoner's mental condition.
Dr. Frankenstein will be here shortly to examine him.
Very well.
The prosecutor may proceed.
What is your name?
Where are you from?
Who brought you to Vasaria?
You see, Your Honour?
This mad beast cannot even talk.
I recommend that you order him remanded to the higher court without further delay.
I understand the little Hussman girl has a certain influence over the prisoner.
Perhaps if she talked to him, we might learn his identity.
Your Honour, I protest.
We've had one harrowing experience with this...
He did her no harm.
And some attempt must be made to establish his identity.
I can't allow my child to take this chance.
We don't know what he might do.
He was promised he'd not be harmed, and he's been beaten half to death.
What's your name?
Where do you live?
Won't you tell us?
All this can serve no purpose, Your Honour.
Dr. Frankenstein is here.
Let him examine the prisoner now.
He seems to recognise you, Dr. Frankenstein.
I never saw this man before in my life.
I know nothing about him.
Come.
Quickly.
Get in here.
Father!
- The monster, it's here. I've seen it.
- Nonsense.
He was standing outside the window, staring at...
Your nerves are on edge. It's the storm.
No, it's here, I tell you.
That other creature was with him. That Ygor.
Frankenstein!
No!
No. Come away.
Come away with me.
Nobody will know who did it.
Come. Come with me.
- Father, who is it?
- Dr. Kettering.
Elsa, go back!
Come away.
Come with me. Come.
Bohmer? Dr. Bohmer!
- What is it, Doctor?
- Give me a hand.
Father.
The monster?
Don't be afraid, darling.
You're quite safe now.
He's powerless for the time being.
Forgive me, Elsa, but I had to expose you to the soporific gas... in order to subdue the others.
You do understand, don't you, dear?
Yes, but I'm afraid.
Send for Erik and the police.
The police can do nothing.
They put him in jail yesterday, but he escaped.
And Dr. Kettering?
I tried to save him, but it was impossible.
He's dead.
- Murdered?
- Yes.
Ever since I can remember,
I have dreaded this moment.
For years I felt secure, certain that the monster had been destroyed.
I tried to keep all knowledge of it from you.
And until last night, I succeeded.
I had to know.
Yesterday, when I saw Ygor...
I felt that something had come out of the past to threaten our happiness.
Please don't let it spoil our lives.
- Father, promise me.
- I promise you, Elsa.
I'll find a way.
I must find a way.
Dr. Bohmer, I need your aid.
This monster must be destroyed.
Destroyed? But how?
He's not subject to the ordinary laws of life.
There is a way.
He was made limb by limb, organ by organ.
He must be unmade in the same way.
Dissection?
Bit by bit, piece by piece... just as my father created it.
But this thing lives. It would be murder.
How can you call the removal of a thing that is not human murder?
I regret, Doctor...
I cannot be part of your plan.
Then I must do it alone.
While it lives, no one is safe.
My son.
What are you about to do?
Would you destroy... that which I, your father, dedicated his life to creating?
I must.
The monster you created is in itself destruction.
Nevertheless, I was near to solving a problem... that has baffled man since the beginning of time... the secret of life, artificially created.
But it has brought death to everything that it's touched.
That is because, unknowingly...
I gave it a criminal brain.
With your knowledge of science, you can cure that.
It's beyond my cure.
It's a malignant brain.
What if it had another brain?
Another brain!
Bohmer! Dr. Bohmer!
What is it, Doctor? You've changed your mind?
Yes. Attach the high-frequency leads to the terminal electrodes.
- Yes, sir.
- Frankenstein!
Come in, Ygor. I may need your assistance.
You have agreed.
You are going to help him, Doctor?
You are giving him life.
Yes, but not for the purpose that you think, Ygor.
I'm giving him strength so that an operation may be successful.
An operation?
Yes, I'm giving him another brain.
You must explain to him when he becomes conscious.
You must make him understand.
Whose brain?
- Kettering?
- Yes, Kettering.
A man of character and learning.
The monster will cease to be an evil influence... and become everything that is good.
No!
You cannot take my friend away from me.
He's all that I have, nothing else.
You're going to make him your friend, and I will be alone.
It will be as I say, or he must be destroyed.
He cannot be destroyed.
There is one way.
- By dissection.
- No.
Not that. Doctor.
Ygor's body's no good.
His neck is broken, crippled and distorted... lame and sick from the bullets your brother fired into me.
You can put my brain in his body.
Your brain?
You can make us one.
We'll be together always... my brain and his body... together.
You're a cunning fellow, Ygor.
Do you think that I'd put your sly and sinister brain into the body of a giant?
That would be a monster indeed.
You'll do as I tell you, or I'll not be responsible for the consequences.
Ironic, isn't it, Doctor?
Yes, the monster's victim shall inherit his body.
And everlasting life.
Build up the voltage potential to its maximum.
It all seems so weird and ghastly.
- I can't stand it any longer, I tell you...
- Elsa.
And you, Father, something's happened to you.
It seems as if a great cloud has come over you.
You don't seem like my father at all.
You must trust me, my dear.
You must realise my problem.
One thing I can assure you.
The monster will never trouble anyone again.
Good morning.
I was wondering, Doctor, when you plan to operate.
At once.
Tonight, if possible.
- I should like to see the patient immediately.
- Yes, Doctor.
A new brain. You understand?
A new brain. New brain!
- Does he understand?
- Yes.
- Is he willing?
- Can't you see?
He is the first time happy in his life.
Good. Take good care of him today.
I shall operate tonight.
All right.
No. Not now. Tonight.
So you're going to let Frankenstein do this operation... to put the brain of his friend into our friend.
- Our friend?
- Yeah.
You, the great Dr. Bohmer... who taught Frankenstein everything he knows.
How would you like to be the leader of your profession in this state?
The head of the medical commission?
The regent of the university?
You weave a pretty fairy tale, crooked neck.
How could that be accomplished?
You will see to it... that the brain of Kettering does not go into the head of the monster.
But why?
My brain will go into it.
- You fool, you'd die.
- Die! I will live again.
Only this crooked body will die.
I will live forever.
My brain in that body would make me a leader of men.
We would rule the state... and even the whole country.
You'll do as I say... and you will have everything you want.
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Erik.
- Good evening.
We're awfully sorry to disturb you.
We've called regarding the escaped maniac.
- Well?
- The countryside's been combed.
Every barn and haystack's been searched... and the neighbouring villages have been notified.
But he and his companion have disappeared completely.
It seems that you've done all that is possible.
A creature like that couldn't pass long unnoticed.
Obviously someone's offering him refuge.
What are you trying to insinuate, Erik?
Perhaps you would care to search the estate.
I warn you, if you contemplate such presumption... you will not be welcome here in the future as my guest.
That won't be necessary.
If you'll permit me to have a few words with Dr. Kettering...
Unfortunately, Dr. Kettering has had to leave suddenly... owing to illness in his family.
He was here yesterday evening. I saw him.
Quite so. He left early this morning.
You were at the station to watch the morning train?
Dr. Kettering was not on the morning train.
I'll have to risk your displeasure, Doctor.
We will search the premises.
Very well.
This is my laboratory, gentlemen.
Inspect the walls and flooring for secret passageways.
Very good.
Mr. Ernst.
Will you guide us, Doctor?
I believe that leads to an old dungeon.
Why, certainly.
What's that room, Doctor?
An auxiliary operating room, maintained at a very low temperature.
It's not in use now.
Will you lead us, Doctor?
It would seem that this room has been recently occupied, Doctor.
You're familiar with my work.
I keep this room ready at all times for the more violently insane.
- You can see that it is not occupied now.
- Yes.
My apologies, Doctor.
I warned you that you might regret this action.
Are you mad? Why did you let him get away?
Let him? You think I had any idea what he was going to do?
Or that I could stop him?
The police have searched the place for him.
Then it's good that we were gone.
Frankenstein's been half insane.
He wants to operate tonight.
- The child complicates matters.
- Leave that to me.
He will have to be told.
Ygor will explain to him.
No, you do not understand.
It will kill her. You wouldn't want to kill your little friend.
But Ygor has a better idea. You will see.
You will have the brain of your friend Ygor.
Tonight, my brain... will be your brain.
Tonight, Ygor will die for you.
Help!
Elsa.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out to find Erik.
- In this storm?
- Yes, Father. I can't...
Father, what does he want?
I'm going to operate to give him a new brain.
He wants the brain of that child.
Take me home. Please, take me home.
Father. Surely you're not going to...
Take the child in there, quickly.
How did the patient react to the anaesthetic?
Surprisingly well, particularly the spinal.
I think I can safely say everything is ready.
Dr. Bohmer, our respective operations must be timed with the utmost precision.
Any delay in the transfer will mean failure.
Exactly, sir.
- Shall I proceed?
- Yes.
I must warn you... this operation may not be successful.
This may be the end of everything.
Better death... than a life like this... now that I have seen... the promise of a life forever.
Kettering's brain.
What will he think when he resumes life in that body?
Will he thank us for giving him a new lease on life?
Or will he object to finding his ego living in that human junk heap?
There's no sign of returning consciousness yet, Doctor.
I anticipated this.
Let me know immediately if there's a change in his condition.
Certainly, sir.
Dr. Bohmer, I can never thank you sufficiently... for your assistance and skill.
This may bring you the recognition which has long been due to you.
That's very nice of you, sir.
None of us will be safe.
Who's he going to get next?
Fellow townsmen, it's two weeks since my little daughter disappeared.
It's the common belief that she perished when my house was burned down.
But a search was made of the ashes... and no bones were found.
She was stolen, stolen by the fiend who murdered Carl and Josef.
We've searched the hills, the mountains and the forests, and he can't be found.
Why can't he be found?
Why can't the police find him?
There's a very good reason. He's being harboured, protected by someone.
There's only one person that would protect a maniac like that.
- Who?
- Dr. Frankenstein.
Let's go to Frankenstein and choke the truth out of him.
Mr. Ernst!
They're on their way to Dr. Frankenstein!
Stop! Stop right where you are!
When did you decide to take the law into your own hands?
When we found out we couldn't get any help from you.
Two men have been murdered, and we want that maniac.
My little child has been stolen.
The law in Vasaria has done everything in its power to apprehend this monster.
Maybe Dr. Frankenstein can tell us where he is.
Nothing's to be gained by hasty action.
Nothing's to be gained by waiting either... when the prosecutor's in love with Frankenstein's daughter.
That has nothing to do with my duty.
Let me have a few moments alone with Dr. Frankenstein.
If he's concealing this monster, he must be made to give him up.
If he refuses, you can take any action you want to.
Does that sound fair to you, men?
I'd like to see Dr. Frankenstein.
He isn't seeing anyone.
- He'll have to see me.
- Erik.
What are those people doing at the gates?
They're demanding to see your father.
Why? What do they want with him?
They think he knows something about the monster's disappearance.
What can we do?
I've got to see him before they do, or
I can't be responsible for the consequences.
- What is it you want?
- The villagers are getting out of hand.
If you expect the protection of my office, you'll have to be frank.
There are certain matters which must be clarified.
- What do you mean?
- The case of Dr. Kettering.
He did not return home.
He wasn't even expected there.
He did not leave Vasaria by train, as you intimated.
Your servants say his clothes are still in his room... which is locked by your orders.
I think the time's come for a showdown, Doctor.
Perhaps you're right, Erik. Come with me.
- May I have a word with you?
- Yes, sir.
It is imperative that we see the patient.
What is his condition?
His recuperative powers have proved tremendous.
He appears to have complete control of all his faculties.
Why did you deny that you were concealing the monster, Doctor?
It was necessary for a while.
You see, Erik, the monster, as you know, was a homicidal maniac.
He killed Dr. Kettering, but Dr. Kettering lives again.
His brain is now inside the skull of the monster.
I have replaced an evil brain with a good one.
I have made amends for the great tragedy... that my father and brother unintentionally brought to this community.
I've restored the good name of Frankenstein.
Let me show you.
He's been in there long enough.
We may be losing valuable time.
All right, men, he's had his chance.
Now it's our turn.
Come on!
Do you recognise me?
Tell me... who am I?
You are Dr. Frankenstein.
And you are?
You are Dr. Kettering.
I am not Dr. Kettering.
I am Ygor.
What have I done?
I am Ygor.
I have the strength of a hundred men.
I cannot die. I cannot be destroyed!
I, Ygor, will live forever!
I've created a hundred times the monster that my father made.
Bohmer! This is your work!
Don't touch him, Frankenstein.
He's my friend.
I should kill you, Frankenstein.
But after all... your father gave me life... and you gave me a brain.
It's the townspeople.
I can't offer you protection now.
Bohmer, turn on the gas.
Fill the house with it.
We'll kill all of them.
Get back! You may all be killed!
They're turning on the gas!
Bohmer! You must be mad!
Leave him alone.
My dear!
I told you it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Find him!
- Get out of the house! Hurry!
- But what about Father?
I'll go back for him.
Bohmer.
I can't see.
- Bohmer! Where are you?
- Here I am.
I can't see you.
Your dream of power is over, Bohmer.
You didn't realise... his blood is the same type as Kettering's... but not the same as Ygor's.
It will not feed the sensory nerves.
Bohmer. You played me a trick.
What good is a brain without eyes to see?
What good is a brain without eyes?
What a beautiful old man.
What a lovely head.
India is filled with old men, memsahib.
But not like the one in the yellow turban.
He's like a head of John the Baptist.
The memsahib refers to the storyteller?
Are these silent monsters at peace with us?
It is but a truce they keep with man.
But I, who have seen their tusks stained red with blood...
I could tell you a tale of the silent ones.
For a few coppers? Eh?
Yea, for a bowl of rice?
What would you do with my image, memsahib?
I would keep it... for a memory of India.
Verily, you would have all India in your picture.
Nay, you would have the book
Of the jungle to read in my eyes.
In the beginning, you must think
Of nothing but silence... a silence so vast that the ear can hear it.
Great trees like the pillars of the temple... with ferns like green carpets underneath.
While above, under the dome of heaven
Where lived the winged ones... the wind moves restlessly,
Whistling across the roof of the world.
These are the eaters of grass
In a world of torn flesh.
Early the little fawns
Must learn their lesson__... feet that make no noise, eyes that see in the dark... ears that hear the leopard leaving his lair.
For the leopard lives by the law
Of claw and horn and fang...
He will kill for hunger and eat thereof... but he will never kill fork killing's sake ... a law all men break. but the jungle folk obey.
These are the lords of the jungle.
The tribe of Hathi, the silent ones.
They go their way, eaters of grass
In a world of carnage.
For the wolves are the true hunters of the jungle.
And like huntsmen,
They stick to their Clan... with a strict regard
For hunting Calls and tribal law.
Free Companions of the woods, they may
Fight and quarrel amongst themselves... until the strongest of them wins
The leadership of the pack.
Yet jungle folk say... the wisest amongst them is the tribe of Baloo, the bear.
He is a teacher of the jungle law.
Yet there is one who knows law__... the barrel-bodied mugger, the Crocodile... with his chin in the shallows
And lust in his cold heart... hoping to drag down to the depths
All who wander along his river bank.
And in the legends of the jungle
There is a black prince... shrewdest of the lords of claw,
Horn and fang...
As bold as a buffalo, as reckless as a wounded elephant... with a voice as soft as wild honey
Dripping from a tree.
Unbridled, unmastered, unafraid.
Bagrheera the black panther.
And now__
Behold, the villain of my tale.
The killer, the man-eater... the assassin who first brought murder to the jungle Clans.
Shere Khan, the tiger.
It is said that in his first kill__... when he was Cain to some
Poor Abel of the glades __... when he ran from the scene of his crime... the trees and creepers
Whipped him with their branches... and striped his yellow hide with the mark of Cain.
This evil lord must have his dish-lickers... his bullies for attendants.
Tabaqui the jackal.
And the hyena__... hungry for the scraps
Of their murderous master's feast.
But my tale is not alone
Of outcasts and heroes.
I will tell you also of the snake, Kaa, the wise one... the oracle who taught Mother Eve
The speech men use... for trickery and sin.
What is the book of life itself but man's war with nature... the struggle between village and jungle,
Under the mantle of wild creepers
And great trees... many a ruined City lies forgotten in the pages of time.
Yea, where a thousand war Chariots
Proclaimed the might of a great king... before whom all men bowed their heads.
Nothing remains but a trellis
For wild figs to sun upon.
But what of the great maharaja,
The loser in this battle?
He has left many such a palace
To his Cousins, the monkey folk.
The bandar-logs __
The outcasts of the jungle.
First you must picture me as I was, milords...
Buldeo, the mighty hunter.
It was a long time ago... and very far away... on a summer's evening in the Seeonee hills.
Ajao. Ajao.
Again some palaver.
Its Buldeo, master.
That fool would make speeches the whole day.
Come, Durga. Let, s listen to him.
Ajao.
You cannot build your houses just anywhere.
We have to plan out our village.
Someday there will be a mighty city here.
A mighty city with marble houses.
The temple shall be there, facing the marketplace.
That's where I wanted the bean patch.
No that's for the marketplace, as Buldeo says.
And the barbershop will face the temple.
I shall find someplace for the bean patches anyway-... outside your mighty city.
Go Durga. Take the child and the old man to the cart.
Nathoo.
Come Grandfather.
Did you hear that?
We're going to have a marketplace and a temple and a mighty city.
Aye we'll have all that
If we can beat the jungle.
But have you and your hundred years seen man win a war with nature?
Sit here Grandfather.
There Nathoo.
Now.
Go back to your work.
Nathoo?
Where are you my baby?
Rao. Look. Our little Nathoo, he has wandered away.
Now don't worry Messua.
The child couldn't go far.
I'll look for him right away.
Durga you search in there.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
- Nathoo.
- Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nat...
Buldeo.
Tiger. My husband.
Rao.
Abdullah. Singh.
Abdullah. Ali. Mohammed. Singh.
Tiger.
No.
No.
Poor master.
Poor Messua.
Let us all go and look for the child.
All men bring your spears.
Ali Singh Abdullah. Torches.
Follow me.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Poor little baby. Poor little Nathoo.
- And that poor mother.
- Poor mother
Is it every woman who can have a wolf nurse her baby for her?
Do you believe that Subahdar?
Oh yes memsahib.
And His Excellency your father, has many records... of wolf children from the Indian hills.
- It is true.
- True?
In the beginning was it not written... that the she-wolves loved the children of man?
Were not the wolves the foster parents
Of many a child in India?
Little naked and bold... the man's Cub entered the wolves' Cave.
Ahai.
He felt just as much at home with the cubs as at his mother's side.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Nathoo.
Lost and tired, he fell asleep among his brothers of the jungle.
Akkela the father wolf,
And Rakksha the mother wolf... knew that Shere Khan is prowling outside
Looking for the man Cub.
So they took him into their family.
Nathoo.
He grew up with the cubs.
They called him Mowgli-- the Little Frog.
Father wolf taught him his business until every rustle in the grass... meant just as much to him as to his brothers the wolf cubs.
All the lords of the jungle became his friends.
He had only one enemy-
Shere Khan the tiger.
Did Mowgli live to hunt Shere Khan?
Did he live? Oh.
But had I known then what I know now.
Twelve years had passed... and Shere Khan was on the trail
Of the wolf boy.

Wait. Wait.
Let me handle him.
Buldeo. Buldeo.
Ow. He bit me.
He is a wild boy.
Cover him up. Cover him up.
Who are you boy?
Can't you hear?
Give me a torch. A torch.
Give me that torch.
This boy has never seen fire before.
He's from the jungle.
Yes he is a wild boy.
We must be kind to him. Release him.
Release him?
Are you mad?
This is a thing of the jungle.
Let me look. Let me look.
Look at the scars on his arms and legs.
Those points on his bones--
He has run on all fours... with wolf cubs.
Poor child.
This boy has been reared in the jungle.
He has the evil eye.
I begin to think he has.
Moonshine.
I think this boy is Messua's little baby which was stolen that day we built the wall.
Could this boy be your's Messua?
No. He's not mine.
But he's a handsome boy.
Eyes like red fire.
Any woman would like to have a son like him.
But my Nathoo was soft and plump.
But, mistress, how could he be plump running naked in the woods?
I warn you all. He has the evil eye.
No, Buldeo.
He is some poor, lost lad-- though not my own.
But I am a lonely woman, and if you would let me...
I will shelter him for some other woman who has lost her son.
He is a wolf.
Let one in, and all will follow.
He will bring down the jungle upon us.
What the jungle has taken,
The jungle has restored, Buldeo.
Aye. Aye.
Take this boy into thy house my sister.
And out of your little hoard of money, forget not to honor me... for I have saved his life on this day.
- Release him.
- Wait.
Are you going to turn this devil loose before I can protect you?
A gun.
- Buldeo--
- Don't...
A gun.
Buldeo.
Now release him.
No.
No.
Boy.
Boy.
Will you come with me?
Come.
Oh. It's, it's all right.
Come on.
Come along. Come.
Come.
It's all right. Come along. Come.
It's all right.
Down upon our heads even before the temple... we have called the curse of the beast.
No more shall we prosper.
The wild pig will trample down our vines.
The tiger will stalk our streets.
We have opened our doors to the devil.
Don't look upon evil.
Mahala. Get home to bed.
At least I can keep my own daughter from harm.
Get back, Kpota.
Is that anyway to treat one who has come to live with us?
I remember the day I gave the first little shoes to my Nathoo.
Wolf-- Uh, wolf boy.
Uh...
Oh, those feet have never worn shoes.
No, you are not my son.
But you look very much like my son Nathoo.
Nathoo called me 'Mother'.
'Mother'.,
'Mother'.,
M-- Mother.
Uhh.
And what did the wolves... call you?
Wolves.
M...
Mowgli.
Mowgli?
A little frog?
Yes, you were like a little frog to them, the beasts of the jungle.
And so you are Mowgli to me.
Come.
Come on.
For months and months after that night...
Mowgli was busy learning the ways,
Language and customs of men.
What are you doing?
You are like a little panther.
I thought someone had found the hiding place.
- Hiding place?
- Mm-hmm.
- What is this?
- Money.
What is it for?
What is money for?
To protect us from hunger and cold.
It lives in a hole like a cobra?
No.
If we need a bag of rice, I give these to the merchant in the square.
He gives us the rice.
- What a fool that merchant must be.
- No.
Will the Man-Pack give us anything for this?
Yes.
Will Buldeo give me a tooth?
Tooth? You have all your teeth.
No. A -A sharp tooth.
Oh, a knife?
Yes. A knife tooth, like a tiger's knife.
What need have you for a knife?
To sink it in the throat of my enemy.
Your enemy? Ha. You talk about
Akela, the father wolf... and Raksha, the
Mother wolf, and how much... better it is in the jungle with all your friends.
Now who could be your enemy?
Shere Khan, the tiger.
Tell Buldeo to sell you a knife.
Give him the money.
I shall have a tooth.
I shall have a tooth.
My father says I mustn't speak to you.
What happened to him?
My father shot him.
We missed you six moons ago.
He was Baloo's cousin.
He had no man for an enemy.
But my father kills every bear he sees.
Why?
Because he is a great hunter.
He kills them even when he's not hungry?
Hungry? We don't eat bears.
Then why did he bring him here?
To show how brave he is.
And my father was very brave to kill that tiger.
That old tiger?
He lived on lizards and rats.
He was too old to hunt rabbits.
He must have died in his sleep.
I see. You could kill the bear and the tiger with one shot.
I kill Baloo's cousin?
I've gone fishing with him.
Fishing with a bear?
How can a bear bait a fishhook?
He looks in the river, he sees the fish he wants, then who.
He knocks it out.
Didn't I tell you not to speak with this thing?
I told Messua to keep you away from this house.
Messua sent me here to talk to you.
She sent me to get a tooth.
A tooth?
Yes. This is the tooth I want.
Put that knife down before I send a shot through you.
And then you would put my head on the wall... like the old Khan there.
But I would spring as I die and give this tooth back to you.
Now, now.
You're not in the jungle, boy.
No.
No, I am not in the jungle, Buldeo.
I am with the Man-Pack, but I am not a man.
What are you, boy?
I was until now a cub.
But now I have my tooth.
I can run with the jungle as I please.
I am a wolf.
If you had a knife... would you go back to the jungle?
The knife is yours for two annas.
Messua gave me three.
One, two, three.
There. Three is more than two.
Yes. More than two.
Now get out of my house.
See, Shere Khan?
- 'Tis for you-- deep in your throat.
- Mowgli.
Won't you be afraid to go back to the jungle?
Afraid of the jungle? Why?
I'm of the wolf pack.
They are my friends.
Then why did you buy the knife?
For Shere Khan, the tiger.
This is for him.
He drove me out of the jungle.
He went away far off... but he swore he would lay my bones in the river when he returned.
I also made a little promise.
I have told the wolves I would kill him.
You can speak their tongue?
You can speak to animals?
Can you talk to Rama, the great herd bull?
Rama is a dumb slave.
He has been with the Man-Pack so long... he cannot talk to anyone.
Can you speak to him?
What did he say?
Don't you know what the monkey people always say?
'We, the monkey people, are the greatest folk in all the jungle.
We know this is true because we always say it is true.
Mowgli, will you let me
Hear you talk to the wolves?
Yes.
Tonight when the moon rises.
- Are you afraid?
- No.
Let's go.
It's a wolf. What did he say?
Wood and water.
Wind and tree.
Jungle favor go with thee.
You have been given the favor of the jungle.
We be of one blood... you and I.
We be of one blood, you and I.
Come, Mowgli. Come.
Come. Come.
Ahai, Hathi.
I am with the Man-Pack now.
See, I have my tooth-- as sharp as a tiger's tooth.
He said Shere Khan is far away... but I had better take care and hide when he comes back here.
Hathi, will you warn me when he comes back to our jungle?
Thank you, brothers.
Then we shall see whose bones will be laid in the river.
Hold on. Tight.
Bagheera.
Mowgli.
Your claws are sharp and strong.
But not as good as mine.
Look.
Who is man that I should care for his ways?
Brown digger, eater of earth.
I am Mowgli of the jungle, back in the night.
Now that I have my tooth, who shall stay me when I strike?
Mowgli, come back.
I'm afraid.
There.
Mighty hunters, greater than your father... who killed everything until the jungle killed them.
Why did they go away?
Why did I go away?
Because I was a man cub, afraid of a tiger.
The jungle knew I was afraid and cast me out.
This was the king's palace.
King?
What is a king?
Oh, Mowgli. You know so much, and yet you know so little.
This was a great walled city... a city with hundreds of elephants and thousands of horses... and thousands and thousands of men.
And it all belonged to a great king.
And where is this great king now?
And where is this great king now?
Where is he now?
Where is he now?
Mahala?
Mahala?
- Mahala?
- Mowgli. Mowgli.
Here I am.
Mahala, are you hurt?
No, I'm all right.
The king's treasure chamber.
Look.
The emeralds.
Pearls.
This is like the stuff I gave Buldeo for my tooth.
The stuff that passes from hand to hand and never grows warmer.
Only this is yellow, and that was brown.
Let's get back to the light.
These pebbles are no good to eat.
There is nothing here. Nothing.
Am I nothing?
Father of cobras, we be of one blood, you and I.
She's only a little cub from the Man-Pack.
She means thee no harm.
Who art thou with the knife and the snake's tongue?
Mowgli, they call me.
I am of the jungle.
The wolves are my people.
Father of cobras, who art thou?
I am the warden of the king's treasure.
The great king built the stone above me that I might teach death... to those who come to steal.
Three times the stone has been lifted by thieves.
Look at thy feet.
The thieves are still here.
But I am no thief.
Indeed.
Be still, Mahala. Be still.
Oh, no, boy.
Let her run to and fro a while.
Let her make some sport.
The others did so until I touched them.
Then they whimpered a while... sighed and were still.
Kill him, Mowgli. Kill him.
Kill him?
Don't be afraid.
Look. Our father of cobras is so old, he has outlived his poison.
Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.
I am ashamed.
There has been too much talk of killing.
Come, Mahala. We'll go now.
Keep that silly treasure.
But I'll take this.
I can use it to prod Rama with.
Look at the ruby, Mowgli.
You could buy hundreds of villages with it.
Aye, boy. Thousands of villages.
Take it with thee.
But see that it does not kill thee at last.
Kill me? This stone?
Yes. I have outlived my poison... but that ruby holds more death than all my tribe.
It will kill and kill and kill... for killing's sake.
My strength is dried up, but this stone will do my work.
It is death, it is death, it is death.
But take the ruby if thou wilt.
Nay, father of cobras. I believe thee.
We shall go as we came.
Aye.
Ye be wise to take no death with thee.
May I take just this one piece, Mowgli?
Keep it if you like.
Get up, lazy bones.
I dreamed I was a princess in the city of the great maharaja.
Get up.
There's no fire in the grate, and there is no rice here.
But it was not a dream.
I saw the great king's city.
Get on with you.
Enough of this talk.
Dream?
This is no dream.
Maybe I am dreaming.
This is pure gold.
Who gave this to you, my darling child?
The white cobra.
Cobra?
Yes.
I did not want the diamonds.
Diamonds?
Nor the big ruby.
Big ruby?
This big.
This big.
Where? What nonsense is this?
Where is this room-- this ruby?
When did you go there?
Whose gold is this, Mahala?
The great king's gold.
In the treasure chamber
Of the king's palace.
I tell you, Father, Mowgli said
I might keep just this one.
Mowgli?
You have been in the jungle?
Last night Mowgli took me there.
But, Father, you will not hurt him?
I would not harm a hair on his head.
But you must never let anyone know about this.
Not a living soul, do you hear?
Yes, Father.
Good morning, Buldeo.
Good morning.
I-I can't take you now, Buldeo.
It'll be at least another hour.
Now wait a minute, Barber.
There-There is no river between us.
Oh. Oh, my-- my poor leg.
Uh, uh -This lumbago is killing me.
I can't go around with half my beard cut.
Ooh. Th--This lumbago is terrible.
I-- I-I can hardly bend my knee.
What makes you tremble like wash upon a line?
Now you keep out of this, Buldeo.
If I cut him, he-he doesn't have to pay.
- Y-You want to cut me?
- No, no.
Now listen here, barber.
I'm not a man to be shorn like a sheep in the midst of a brawl.
- Barber-
- I want...
- Barber?
- Hmm?
Move your left foot.
Well, uh...
I said the left foot.
Oh, oh, the-the l-l-l-l... l-l-- left.
Left.
This foot.
Excuse me, Buldeo.
You are standing on my money.
- Your money?
- I saw it first.
Jackals....
- It's mine.
- There's no need to quarrel.
- There's enough for all.
- Where? Where?
There's a lost city... in the jungle.
- You have found a treasure.
- Where?
Shh. Do you want to tell the whole village?
Not a word now.
My daughter found it with the jungle boy.
Tiger's coming.
Up, you dumb ones. Up.
Up. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Ho. Ho.
Tiger. Tiger.
- Th-Th-The--
- Tiger.
To the temple. To the temple.
To the temple.
To the temple, all of you.
Shut the gates. Shut the gates.
Tiger. Tiger.
- Quickly, Little Frog, to the temple.
- No. Not I.
- I have my tooth.
- No, no. Don't go. Don't go.
Mowgli.
Wait.
Don't go. He will kill you.
No. I shall bring back his yellow hide.
Mowgli.
Mowgli.
Where is your son, Messua?
Where did he go?
Stop him. He has gone after the tiger.
Oh, that bragging of a child.
Don't be impatient, Buldeo.
He'll be back.
Suppose the tiger should kill him.
Ooh, what a tragic calamity.
No, no, we must save him.
We must bring him back.
How kind you all are to comfort me this way.
He really is a sweet boy.
I knew you would come to love him.
Love him? I wish I had a boy like him.
Now, don't worry.
If he's not back in a short time,
I'll track him to the ends of the earth.
Kaa.
Kaa.
I want to sleep.
Go away.
I have to talk to you.
Who are you?
Can't you see, Kaa?
What does the Law of the Jungle say?
We be of one blood... ye and I.
Ye come.
Ah.
It is a manling.
It's I, Mowgli, Kaa.
The Little Frog... the one that used to throw stones at me?
I was a cub then, Kaa.
You called me a flat-headed earthworm.
Forgive me... for you are a wise, old, strong... and most beautiful Kaa.
True.
I am beautiful.
Yes.
I am beautiful.
Now that I am a man,
I have a tooth.
I wish to pull the whiskers of death.
The striped one?
You know all things?
I know that Shere Khan has killed... and eaten... and now sleeps by the bamboo.
Tabaqui the jackal told me so... uh, before he passed on.
Tabaqui?
Yes, indeed.
Here he is.
How may I slay his master, Kaa?
He'd kill you with one blow.
Let us go upstream.
Hold on, little brother.
Shere Khan is nothing but a big cat... and all cats fear the water.
But Shere Khan will not follow me into the river.
Since you're a man... use your cunning.
And if I made him angry, Kaa... will he follow me into the river?
If he will not catch you first.
Thank you, wisest of all.
Go on.
I'll wait for you here.
Wish me good hunting...
O wise, strong and most beautiful Kaa.
Good hunting.
Good morning, Shere Khan.
Did I wake you up?
You hunter of worms... you striped cattle thief.
Don't sneak away.
Coward.
You mangy yellow dog.
Come back.
Can't you jump?
Are you too old, you frog eater?
Fish killer.
I'll get your hide today.
No, no. I won't come down.
You come up to me.
Get this.
And this.
Bah.
Come on, Shere Khan. Catch me.
- This is getting dangerous.
- Yes.
Maybe there are tigers waiting for us in this tall grass.
All right.
Stay here.
Shere Khan is dead.
I have killed Shere Khan.
What if he finds the boy and tears the secret from him... and-and then says he didn't find him?
You're right.
We cannot trust him.
Uh, you go first, and I'll protect your rear.
You go first, and I'll protect your rear.
Go on.
By the Bull that bought me,
I made a promise... a little promise.
Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.
Come, Shere Khan.
Lend me your coat.
You won't need it anymore.
You don't need to shoot, Buldeo.
I have killed him.
Look at him.
This is the end of a very old war.
Hmm. You have killed him.
You found him there.
I killed him with my tooth.
He is mine.
Who are you to tell me what is yours?
Get up, boy.
You took my daughter to the jungle last night.
You took her to a lost city.
Come on.
Take me to the treasure chamber.
I will not take you, Buldeo.
The Lost City is a city of death.
The treasure is death.
- I will never take you there.
- Come on, jungle brat.
Come on, or I'll shoot you.
- Go ahead and shoot.
- You scum of the wolf cave.
I-I hope he didn't shoot the boy.
No. No.
That's a sign for us.
Change back to a man... and spare my life.
Spare my life, Mowgli.
I did not know you were anything more than a herd boy.
May I rise up and go away... my lord?
Get up.
Go. Tell Messua that Mowgli has avenged her man.
He has killed Shere Khan and will bring home his yellow hide.
Maharaja.
Look.
Great king.
Go on.
Maharaja.
- Maharaja.
- Great king.
- Tell me the secret too.
- Tell me too.
They say there's enough for three.
- Great king.
- Great king.
Three old vultures.
- Go back to your village.
- Yes, milord.
- Ma-- Maharaja.
- My king.
- Where -Where is the treasure?
- Go back to your village.
Maharaja. Great lord.
Here. Here, you.
- Did he tell you the secret?
- Come on. Where's the treasure?
Do ¡V Don't try to cheat us.
The boy told you where to go.
Boy indeed.
Didn't I tell you the first time I saw him he was a witch?
I saw him with my own eyes change himself into a black panther.
Come on, Buldeo. No tricks now.
If you try to cheat us, we'll change you into something worse, I swear to you.
Get down, Bagheera.
Stop their quarrel.
The boy turned himself into a black panther before my eyes.
He is a witch, I tell you.
I must warn the village.
- Buldeo--
- Here.
I still think you're lying, and I'll soon find out.
Ho.
Ho.
Come, Shere Khan.
Look at Buldeo, the mighty hunter.
Ho.
Ho.
Now go get him. Get him.
What have I done?
Why do you stand there gaping so?
Gather branches. Build a fire.
Remember, he must have a chance to confess.
Yes, the three of us will deal with him alone.
We'll deal with him all right.
Clear the way.
Buldeo, we are ready.
Bring the witch-boy.
Well, boy?
Witch or devil, whatever you are... you heard them.
They are ready.
One last choice... the secret or the fire.
Buldeo.
Buldeo.
Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.
Good.
You talk to him.
I will leave you alone.
He won't tell.
I think we'll have to burn him.
Then we would never find the treasure.
We'll burn him... but not now.
The boy will lead us to the Lost City first.
Nathoo, my little son... why won't you tell them the secret?
Never will I take them into the jungle.
But they will set you free... free to live with me.
- Live with you?
- Aye.
I have a jungle mother too... and these two things fight together in me... like the snakes fight together in the spring.
I was a wolf.
The jungle cast me out.
I am a man.
The Man-Pack cast me out.
But you have killed Shere Khan.
You can go back to the jungle.
Aye, you can be lord of the jungle.
No.
I have nowhere to go... but into the Red Flower-- the fire.
No.
But it does not matter.
The jungle will know from Bagheera that I have killed Shere Khan.
No. The jungle will know from you, Mowgli.
See? Here is your tooth.
Mother.
Watch, watch, watch, watch.
- See them'
- He'll escape.
Are you also too dumb to see it?
Of course. He'll escape, and then we'll follow him to the treasure.
That's right.
You two go to the edge of the jungle.
Wait there and mark his trail.
Go.
Your time is up.
It's the mother witch who freed him.
Get her.
Wait. Wait.
Messua is no witch.
But Buldeo is a bad...
Tie both of them until I return.
Buldeo. He entered by this tree.
He never suspected we let him escape.
Don't say that.
See?
There is his trail.
I'm ¡V I'm frightened.
Hmm.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We have our guns.
Let's go.
We can't be very far away.
Listen, brothers.
I have planted tracks for them as deep as an elephant's.
They will be here soon.
Quiet, you grinning black shadow.
Quiet, gray brother.
This is not our kill.
- Look, look.
- Look.
- Wait for me.
- Not so fast....
I will be the maharaja.
I will be the maharaja.
I will be the maharaja
Of this mighty city.
I will be the chief of all the temple.
I will be the chief of all the temple.
I will have all the barber shops.
I will have all the barber shops.
Let's look for the treasure.
Let's look for the treasure.
You look over there.
Uh--
Look.
I found it. I found it.
He found it.
Come on. He found it.
Wait for me.
Wait for me.
He found it. Come on.
Wait for me, Buldeo.
- Let us go in there.
- Let us go in.
I-I-- I found it.
I-I claim the right of first choice.
That's right. You deserve it.
He goes first.
I'll help you.
Help yourself. I'll help you.
Shoot. Shoot.
Sh-Sh-- Shoot.
Don't ¡V Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Shoot. Shoot.
No, no. Don't ¡V Don't shoot. Don't.
Pull me out. Pull me out.
Pull me, Shoot, will you?
Pull me up.
You missed him.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
A million.
I'll never have to count again.
Maybe we've been cheated.
It's gold. It's gold.
It's the mother and father
Of all the rubies in the world.
Where's my royal turban?
They're all pure gold... and they're all mine.
I shall walk upon gold.
I shall eat upon gold.
I shall use gold for a coverlet.
- Give it to me.
- Give it to me.
- It's mine.
- Give it to me.
No. Are you mad?
Shall I bash your heads in?
- Give it to me. I had first choice.
- No, it's mine.
The old cobra was right.
First, they go mad.
Don't forget, Buldeo, we are two to one.
I want that ruby.
- Let go.
- It's mine.
- Let go.
- You miserable barber.
It belongs to my robe.
It belongs to me, you understand?
- It's mine.
- Have we lost our reason?
Are we children?
Isn't there enough for three, 300, 3,000?
We'll be the most powerful men in all India.
Here.
I can buy thousand of rubies like this with my share.
Buldeo, you are wise and good.
You saved my life.
You killed the cobra.
You are my friend.
Then stop quarrelling.
Load yourselves up.
We have to get out before nightfall.
Hurry. We've got to get out of here now.
Thieves. Vultures.
Get out of the jungle.
Get out.
D-Did I hear what I heard?
The panther spoke with the tongue of the boy.
Yes.
The boy spoke with the tongue of the panther.
This place is bewitched.
Oh, the gold.
This is the way.
Where's the log? It was here.
How do we cross now?
We can wade through.
Wait.
There are crocodiles in this river.
What are you waiting for?
- It's this way.
- No, no. We came past this tree.
- I tell you, it's this way. Come on.
- No.
Quiet. Don't argue, Barber.
You're going the wrong way.
You're going the wrong way.
Give it to me.
- Wait here. Come on. Come on.
- Look.
They are heading back to the Lost City.
- Here it is. There it is. Come on.
- Over there is right. Let's go.
Come on.
Now I shall see if Father Cobra spoke the truth.
If the thing is death... these men will die.
You saw it.
I only wanted to look at the gold.
And he-- he tried to kill me.
I had to do it, Buldeo.
I had to do it.
Naturally.
You -You must bear witness.
Please, you must bear witness, Buldeo.
Quiet, gray brother.
He tried to kill me, Buldeo.
You must bear witness.
I had to kill him.
I had to kill him, Buldeo.
He...
Help. H-H-Help.
Help.
Did I hear someone call?
Now, gray brother... there is only one.
Bagheera, gray brother... chase him out of the jungle.
Sing him home.
You grinning monster.
Change into any beast you will.
Wolf, panther... any beast you will.
I'm not afraid of you.
Change.
Change.
Scream.
Scream, you witches of the forest.
Scream.
I'll burn that mother witch Messua... and I'll come back with a hundred strong... and set fire to your jungle... when the east wind blows.
I'll burn you all.
Burn you all.
Burn you all.
Hathi. Thou knowest the village
Of the Man-Pack that cast me out.
They're idle, senseless and cruel.
They do not kill the weaker for food... but for sport.
When they are full-fed, they would throw their own breed into the Red Flower.
This I have seen.
It is not well that the Man-Pack should live here anymore.
Kill them? Why?
What good are their white bones to me?
We shall let the jungle in upon them... and give the village back to the wild gourd vine.
They will burn us both.
Why did you fight them, Durga?
Why did you defend me?
It was I who brought him into the world.
He's my son.
Aye, mistress.
You could have saved yourself, Durga.
No, mistress.
If you must leave the world tonight, it is written that I shall go with you.
Buldeo is here. Look.
Buldeo.
What happened?
- Where is the pundit?
- Where is the barber?
Dead. Both dead.
Killed by the wolfboy.
But I know how to deal with him.
I'll burn him.
Burn him up.
I'll burn him.
We're all lost if the wind turns.
The jungle is burning.
Hurry up, Hathi.
Mowgli.
Where's my mother?
What have you done with her?
They left Messua bound in her house.
They would not let me take her.
They said she was a witch and that the fire would take her.
Now the same fire will take them.
But they were frightened, Mowgli.
Lead them, Mahala, to the little island in the middle of the stream.
- Where we saw the elephants, Mowgli?
- Yes. The fire can't touch you there.
Hurry. The wind is shifting.
Break the door, Hathi.
Break the door.
Push. Push.
Harder. Push.
I knew you would come.
See, Durga?
You'll be safe among them now.
- But you, my son-- Come with us.
Not while one little cub is in danger.
Now, go too.
Go on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Swim, gray brother. Follow me.
This way. Follow me.
Come on, Bagheera.
Come on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Go on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.
Mowgli.
Come back with us at last.
I am of the jungle.
Their lair is my lair.
Their trail is my trail.
Their fight is my fight.
Ahai.
He's no longer my son.
He's a godling of the woods.
So I didn't have my revenge after all.
I became no Mharaja... of a mighty city.
Even the little village burned to the ground.
In my struggle with the jungle... as you see, milords...
I was beaten.
And then? What happened then?
What became of Mowgli and your daughter?
And how did you escape from the fire?
That, memsahib... is another story.
Why do you always talk of this italian?
Her hair shines like ebony.
Her eyes are as blue as the sea her mouth is a flower, her skin is like ivory... and her bottom's marzipan? Selim, you're quite amorous, for a eunuch my heart was not trimmed i didn't mean to hurt you i've not only told you about her; i've told her about you you know the world, you know mankind; perhaps you can help her the fifth window from the left?
Can you help that poor soul?
I'll have to, if only for my own sake i'll murder the sultan, if nothing better occurs to me
- who is that yelling?
- It could be your cook
- why is he howling?
- He's getting twenty strokes did i order that?
The princess's boat was seized by an osman ship at corfu the d'este family offer one thousand ducats for her return my second mission concerns the baron m黱chhausen the empress of russia offers one thousand ducats for his release a beautiful girl and an entertaining man...
...cannot be compensated for with gold my good christian, are you a prisoner?
But i thought you were dead long ago i live as long as i please so our baron has become a turk you've become fat it's dreadful; such sluggish journeys disagree with me the others got thinner, but i got fatter the sultan calls for you i'll see what i can do for you what a man!
Leave us!
Get up sit down turkey is wonderful, your highness except for seating you sit on chairs, like puppets.
We sit closer to the earth have you thought of a nice idea?
If you haven't... in pera you have a marvellous park.
Build a house of glass for your harem glass walls, floors, tables, baths... glass beds, everything glass, everything transparent...
...except the sultan and his wives, of course the recipients of your caresses must not be too fragile, so they say i'd see them as soon as i arrived, i'd see them all at once i'd see them walking, sitting, lying... behead the builder!
A good idea; the house shall be built
- why behead the builder?
- He didn't think of the idea you'll be my adviser; i'll make you aga of janissaries later a pasha, or even a vizier. But you must take my religion; mine's best
- i can't do that
- my religion is the best!
Who knows what is best?
Almost no-one knows what is good if you come from bodenwerder, you can't become a turk everyone has one homeland, just as they have one mother besides, it's awfully tiresome to die of thirst
- who asks you to do that?
- Your prophet forbids wine
- water is a delicious drink
- i'm afraid i'm no judge of that
- what do you think water is for?
- For washing with from today you drink no wine, only water!
I'd rather die of thirst although the prophet is always right, i sometimes do wrong when no one is looking, of course this tokay was sent from hungary; it's the best i've ever tasted it's very good, but i've drunk better excuse me for interrupting such high discourse, but yassuf pasha is here what now? He's delivered the prisoners and booty during the night, the russians filled in the marsh...
...and in the morning they stormed ochakov not a bad idea admit yussuf pasha
- who is to blame?
- I alone, your highness tell the executioner to stick your head on a pole, as an example good-bye, your highness.
Allah is great
- what were we talking about?
- The essence of life yes, that better tokay; where can i get it?
From maria teresa, in vienna.
She said to me:
My dearest m黱chhausen, this tokay is historic, so to speak in 1683 it saved the viennese from the turks if our commander had not drunk too many glasses of it...
...he would never have made his victorious attack but he saw his army of 5,000 double...
...and so, thanks to his tokay army, he saved golden vienna no wonder my ancestors lost the battle of kahlenberg it's really better?
Shall we bet on it?
My batman and runner are among the prisoners i'll send my runner to vienna, to fetch a bottle
- when will he return?
- I can't promise too much he's out of form. Let's say in an hour, allowing for headwinds don't mock me!
What do you bet?
If he returns in an hour, i'll free all three of you done! And what if the tokay is better than yours?
You can make a wish summon clock!
- What do you wish for?
- Princess d'est, from your harem agreed. But if you lose the bet... the bet is on!
Our bet will commence when you leave the hall when clock has counted sixty minutes, either i'll have lost... or i'll lose my head your highness, twenty-two... i'm feverish, so i'm rather fast good! I want to be called in fifty minutes. I'll be in the harem here is a letter for empress maria theresa when you see me again, i'll be as slim as a pine hurry, or in an hour i'll have nowhere to put my hat you're always up to something you should have picked a master who collects snuff-boxes, not adventures bad teeth!
Good teeth!
- Open your mouth
- shan't!
There's always trouble with the new ones i must check your teeth i won't be treated like this!
Ten strokes on the backside for this old bird then we'll try to get rid of her
- how long?
- Thirty minutes, eight seconds what about escaping quietly?
One should never lose one's head before it's off it is the enviable privilege of women to be loved our privilege is to love only ten minutes left?
You're sure it isn't twenty?
I can't think where our runner is there's uskub there's belgrade there's the fellow, lying down he's asleep under a fig tree near belgrade
- shoot!
- I'm so jumpy, i might hit him don't hit him; shoot a fig into his mouth, so he wakes up i'll be late if i don't hurry
- can you see him?
- Not yet three minutes. Pity about such a clever head; it's wobbly already my knees aren't yet wobbly, your highness fifty-nine minutes... finally!
Empress maria theresa's greetings to baron m黱chhausen thanks! I'm lucky you did it you and your two men are free.
Now we shall see... collect my things and hire a fast boat. I'll follow this tokay is indeed better i'll have the wine, and you'll have the princess i had not hoped we'd meet again so soon
- i neither
- you fool!
Not every man keeps his word as you do, highness keep your princess!
It's a pity the cellar master in vienna isn't like you if he was, you'd be drinking vinegar, not wine what's the matter with him?
He's known me for twenty years how time flies
- will you come with me?
- Freedom does not tempt me farewell, selim, my contemporary without desire and you can tell your sultan... perhaps better not fear not, princess. It's me come quickly where are you, baron?
Don't always be in such a hurry can't you slowly reappear?
I don't like you invisible but, christian, i must get dressed first no need to look away, princess now my dagger... and my hat... where, princess? To the world's end, or... to venice shouldn't we say hello to rosalba?
Your picture isn't finished yet is that only my fault?
No, it's also because a day has only 24 hours rosalba, who is that man?
I think i should know him can't you sit still for a minute, casanova?
How careless of them to allow you into venice once more i'll not sit at the gaming table with you; you're too lucky are you the m黱chhausen i knew in lyons, paris, livorno and madrid?
The man the duchess inadvertently hid in a wardrobe...
...into which she had already deposited me?
You must be in league with the devil.
I have grown twenty years older...
...yet you... youth is an art then i am a dabbler. I've wearied, i no longer like to roam the world the eyes have their fill, but the heart remains empty life is short...
...and death snatches us before the fascinating game is over why allow yourself to be snatched?
I'll go in my own good time venice is a good hideout in carnival time, princess but take care. The inquisitors have ten thousand eyes and limbs venice has power to do right or wrong, as she pleases let's hope the doge has no time to waste on two lovers the wind is still unfavourable, your excellency but as soon as it changes, i'll be ready for the ascent monsieur blanchard, i welcome your intended flight we serve science and amuse the people it's part of a statesman's art to do one thing and achieve two i serve only science retain that superstition; it is a card in our hand they stay at the palazzo vendramin the republic will give your family satisfaction, prince...
...for a foreign adventurer hiding your sister here but it is carnival; we wish to avoid excessive bloodshed have our inquisitors any proposals?
Certainly, your excellency we could go to the mikado opera, or walk along the promenade, and later, if you'd like, go for a little game to the via venetto you are my lucky charm!
What if we stay at home?
You bring me luck wherever we are luck!
I believed in it, when i was a child, as children believe in fairy tales when i grew up, they engaged me to an old man, but he was a visconti, and that meant a great deal to my parents and then i was even taken away to istanbul what happened to my childhood, with its tales of luck?
Then you saw me, and your window was barred when everything seemed lost, the victory was already ours never forget, my sweetheart, that destiny doesn't give us good luck, it only loans it to us and the interest rate is high sometimes it costs your life kuchenreutter has been attacked is christian back from germany already?
We've lured him away from her my own brother it's hopeless no, baron, our runner is gone he was a decent fellow, christian i could wish for no finer demise, though there is no hurry as in living, his death was in haste how is my father?
Well, he's not the youngest any more, the old man he gave me a letter and a few brunswick sausages and a cup of brandy what can we do, baron?
Nothing at all are you at home to mr. Casanova?
All venice talks of your misfortune last night
- please, sit down
- the poor princess my runner has been killed, and i fear the worst for isabella no, she is alive the abbess of the justin convent, an old...
...an old friend of mine, has sent me secret word your princess was taken to the convent last night there is little you can do...
...but you will be allowed to speak to your poor friend fate does not give us happiness, it only lends it sometimes with high interest don't cry, i'll free you once more this time you won't succeed let us say farewell you are in danger. I shall be less unhappy when you are far away i shall always love you forget me. Farewell take off that mask. I want to see the sort that buries his sister alive do you want a duel?
If possible, before i weaken and break your neck any gondolier will take you to the island...
...where one discourses sword in hand wait here pay the return fare first.
You might get killed now you can go and die jolly fellow, that this island looks like a mousetrap see that our escape is not cut off the weapons, gentlemen you permit me to keep my coat on?
It's hardly worth taking it off ready?
Do you like my answer?
I came for a duel, not to give you fencing lessons tie his sword to his hand you must hold on until they get here with the arrest warrant i could kill you, but i'll just ridicule you for life that'll do i left your breeches out of decency
- i must shoot myself
- first he must go to heaven hurry into the boats!
Faster! Faster, gondolier.
You'll get a bag full of money!
Christian!
How many ropes mooring blanchard's balloon?
- Four thick ropes, baron
- shoot through two of them they're shooting at us!
Faster! They're alongside the balloon clear off, or i'll blast my initials into your backside!
I always wanted to fly, baron they've cut the last ropes so long, venice!
Heaven will do the job for us now shoot yourself flying is wonderful!
Are we still heading for the moon?
I hope we land on the half we never see from earth i've always wanted to see her back she knows what is proper christian, isn't this fantastic?
Double-bases and trumpets hanging from trees don't amaze me much but a cherry tree, just like at home, that is something i wonder if there's something like people?
Certainly, or who would eat the cherries when they're ripe?
Yes, that's true strange, when we arrived it was dawn, yet now the sun...
...stands as high as noon your hands are getting shaky because we have such an easy life what's happening to you?
Since you lathered me...
...you have a score more grey hairs it's because of the change of air is it the sleeping sickness?
Christian, aren't you hungry here?
Ripe cherries?
Did i sleep a quarter of a year?
Not more than two hours either your watch is broken, or time itself... time is broken we landed this morning, and the cherries blossomed now it's late afternoon, and the cherries are ripe were ripe evening is coming; one could say it is autumn luckily our balloonist thought of everything i wouldn't have dared to chop up a squalling double-bass now i am too hot. This moon is a rather exhausting star i've been thinking it over, baron a year at home equals a day on the moon... no, the other way round on the moon, a day and a year are the same thing in one year, one is 365 years old here a year older every day we'll fly back home today i never settle down, you always want to move on we fly at noon. This is an unlucky star from which star, may i ask?
Earth welcome! I'll be at your disposal shortly meantime, you can converse with the gentlemen but of course. With great pleasure it's said your people have been here before...
...and were always amazed by our taking our heads off it seems easier than i expected, madam it's so practical while my head chats with you, my hands are doing the housework that would be something for our women and moon couples don't like to be completely separated life is too short may i ask, madam, how old you are?
Try to guess look straight at me turn me a little in your case, it's very difficult, madam some catty friends say i'm twenty-seven days old but i'm only twenty-three days and three hours twenty-three days old already?
You don't look a day over seventeen and one hour what a pity i haven't got my pretty body with me; it looks even younger isn't it dangerous to leave such a pretty body all alone?
It's locked up at home very sensible. Then, despite losing its head, it can't do anything silly
- how much longer till i'm ripe?
- Three hours. You're not ripe yet strangers live no longer than us on the moon when he dies, he dissolves into smoke, and vanishes that doesn't apply to me, but... have you nothing but cherries here?
Only vitamins
- do you know what a pig is?
- We have no pigs good lord! No beer, no animals!
Removable heads, childbearing by fruit trees... when i tell them that at home...
- forgive me
- certainly i'm sorry to cause you inconvenience, baron i'm going to die, just when i've settled down
- the old earth-dweller is dying
- yes. Take me away it will be my first journey without you i'll miss you terribly i think i'd rather stay with you my family shouldn't be cross with me for being away so much of course they won't be cross. What would i have done without you?
I needed at least one friend dear baron...
...may i call you by your first name for once?
Hieronymus, old chap
Imagine us two as angels follow soon...
...in your own good time i leave you my gun man is like smoke, rising and drifting away m黱chhausen found...
...such a death more significant and poetic than earthly crumbling to dust of course, life was only worth living on earth so he returned to new adventures, new suffering...
...new happiness it's chilly, hieronymus; let us go indoors he arrived in paris to witness heads removed in the cause of reason
1789. the french revolution again in paris...
...he rode beside marshal blucher into the tuileries in 1814? Surely not m黱chhausen died in 1797 the encyclopaedia is wrong others aged; he stayed as he was others died; he lived on he loved restlessness, so he didn't want to age time and again...
...he had to move on, because people became afraid of him he had no real homeland, for mortals only love and trust other mortals in 1848 he fought with radetzky in lombardy he was in mexico when emperor maximilian was shot
1867? And if he is not dead, he lives today exactly in 1900 he married a beautiful girl there she sits if he is not dead, he lives today take me home, fritz i'd just like to ask the baron... home this very moment
- excuse me, but my fianc閑...
- of course, don't let us detain you thank you for your forbearance.
A unique story
- farewell
- have a nice life why frighten her? You should not have told the whole truth go away from here; begin a new life don't stay out of consideration for me; i shall have my memories no, i don't want time to forget me any more time the book-keeper, who adds the years on one's face i don't want to be young when you are old i don't want to live on when you die i love you of my own free will, i return my present to fate eternal youth makes you a demi-god, but only half a man i want the whole of life i want the rest we thank:
